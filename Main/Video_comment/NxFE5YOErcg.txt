Eu tô no chão com essa música 😢 é meu top 3
Imagine ❤
My heart hurts deeply as I have watched the last few songs/videos by A7X.  Thank you for the years you all gave us some of the best memories and moments that carried millions of us who were lost.  Thank you for the lyrics and mesmerizing rifts for they carried many through to today.  I don’t understand why you all made such a drastic choice, but as someone who followed the work you all created I give me deepest respects and regards.  I’m deeply saddened by the change and will continue to listen to the works you have created before.  I cannot bring myself to listen to the new album- it’s not the Avenged Sevenfold that many grew up with.
The ones who love us never really leave us!  A7X nothing else like them.. Jimmy rev rest in peace
My cat likes me singing this song to him. I love my cat
Brooks went crazy on the drums those last couple minutes, unreal. Every part of this song is amazing.
Memento mori. Be mindful of death. Why fear the inevitable? Why fear what we don’t know, what we’ll only understand when it happens? Instead, be aware that death is going to come, and be ready when it does. I think that’s why the skeleton danced on the beach, in defiance of what fear he had left and acceptance of his death. But let’s take a look at the rest of the song, the theme of loving someone even into another life. I think the skeleton accepted death not because of its inevitability, but because he would be reunited with his lost love. When he flips the hourglass, I think he was waiting for death, waiting for that opportunity, he was satisfied with his life and all he wanted was to live that next life with the person he loved. I’m not saying he outright wanted to die, but that he was willing to die. The difference being that the willingness to die is not trying to die, but not resisting when it comes. If anybody reading this has any thoughts on the subject, please, sound off, I’d love to hear them.

Greatest band on the planet. One of the greatest songs of all time. And a good video to boot. The talent A7X holds and surrounds itself with will be something that sticks with me into the stars beyond forever.
Te quiero amigo 😉🤟😍😘🫶🙌🙏❤️
I truely love A7X. I think they are geniuses but shame on them for fucking up the amazing melody they had at 3:45 😡
I don't want anyone to die 🎲

Outta words. Adorable❤
The skeleton dancing on the beach is so goddamn wholesome smh😂 love it, as a whole!!!
A pretty extensive scroll down the comments clearly shows how not enough people know who the band Cynic are. 🙂 I'm not knocking it, this is fantastic Cynic worship. Absolutely nailed the drums/production, particularly the 'how could i' style groove and heavily hit 8th note descending tom fills. Nicely done. 👌
5:05 one million fireflies ahh bridge.
The moment the skeletons starts dancing makes me feel like all the death and misery I've experienced in my life is okay. I like to think this is how our loved ones are like after death within the afterlife. And I'm sure it is close enough❤❤

Thank you for creating one of the most beautiful songs in the world 🙏

Who came from asphalt legends
Memmer; this is Jesus (🌈)..  The greatest story ever told; because its the living truth  No way around it; it will always come out (even if they [a7x] wasnt doing it on purpose)..
Watch this about 10 times  and do DMT! Everything will be explained to you if you get in the groove.
1:33 that guitar is 🔥
This song with that beautiful videoclip is divine
2045 Indonesia emas😂😂😂😂
Sinister Gates is truly a genius, I think.
This song is literally beautiful bro goddamnnn

Such an underrated song...
Mensajito para marido: gracias por hacerme escuchar esta banda. Movistar  Arena <3
AMÉ
Que música é essa mano.... Show e esse clipe. Fodastico
Man I don't know why but I cried when I listen to this music 😢
Saw lord Krishna on the dancing person
Omg. Synyster is out of the word... not world.. no one will describe his skills... they all are perfecto... you dont play guitar with your neck.. you play with your bum bum
True masterpiece. And so few views...
🤟
hi mom, haha 🗽 ☕️ 🚬 ⚕️ 🤫☺️ 🌏 🌚 🌞

I didn't know it's been a years, time does flys... man, A7x always put a lot in their songs
What the hell is wrong with these guys.. I've listened this a lot. Synyster should be banned.. too amazing... these days youtuber should not compare themself with real deep legends... kind of funny
I'm not crying, you are
i thought i had listened to all kinds of music then i listened to my daughter and listen to these guys extreme talent extreme preformances from lots of there songs I am 63 yrs old and love these guys
21/22.. i couldnt guess shepard of fire 😢🔥
This is not an animated video clip but this is a depiction of imagination 😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙂‍↕️
So freaking good, heck yea
Mike...I love you and miss you so much...Until we meet again. ❤
Until we meet again.
I must be at the right high! At the ending where the skeleton (death) is sitting staring at the hourglass on the table. Its a ohmage to Terry Pratchett's Hogfather! Death would totally be doing that! Sitting... Watching... Admiring... Fucking love that movie.
Has anyone been here in August 2025 and heard of it at asphalt legends unite?
J’adore ,c’est magnifique  Superbe chanson et le clip est vraiment excellent ❤
Reminds me of Falling in Reverse-Coming Home.
This song is a masterpiece! Love you a7x!
This will go down as one of the greatest rock songs ever made. You heard me. ROCK songs.
LOVE FROM ASSAM, INDIA MASTERPIECE <3
sorry but not nearly what i was expecting.  as with a lot of groups the latter efforts pale in comparison to earlier ones. go back to what you started with. angst and hell raising screaming lead vocals and guitar in your face bass and staccato rapid fire drums. be evil and have the power of metal erupt from your nutsacks again. shozbot, nanoonanoo.
Here for an early morning cry session before I start my next chapter in life. 🖤

i know they get a lot of hate for making this album so different from the others, but i really appreciate the new feel, the vocals and solo are absolutely beautiful in this song
R.I.P Ozzy.
Today, this song has a whole new meaning. I briefly dated a Persian woman here on a visa and we had the most amazing dates. We both love Avenged Sevenfold and this song. She went overseas to work on her business, and we intended on reconnecting. But the US government rejected her the day before her flight because she has dual citizenship in Iran. This song gives me hope we’ll be reunited again someday. Until then, I miss you Ms Strawberry 🍓
The best song of this album
Essa música ❤ da melhor banda do mundo ❤
The best Avenged Sevenfold song.  Like Pink Floyd with Comfortably Numb sometimes it takes years for a band to release something legendary.
Antigamente a gente achava o lyric nos comentários 😢
I want this song played at my funeral
Up there with there best for sure
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😉😌😘
now this drummer is good as the rev
THE BEST BAND EVER !!!! THANK YOU AX7 FOR HELPING ME IN THE WORST AND BEST MOMENTS IN MY LIFE !!!!
❤
This song is the greatest song i’ve ever listened to  I will gave it to my future children as a gift till i die
I do like Exist but this song somehow feels like an upgraded version, its got that same sense of grandeur and the universe passing by but it's shorter and more palatable, and honestly, even MORE beautiful. To call this song anything other than a masterpiece would be a disservice.

I love a7x so much but what is this come on

Third eye
2102 anyone?
It remembers me a band called pain of salvation
I've been waiting for Avenged Sevenfold to play a show in my city for over 10 years. Back in high school, I Won’t See You Tonight was the song that touched me the deepest — I used to dream about hearing it live with someone I loved. But back then, there was no one by my side, and the band never came to Turkey.  As time passed, another song joined that dream — Cosmic. It became the most emotional and impactful A7X song for me. When I heard they were finally coming to Turkey, I was overjoyed, especially knowing that this time, I’d be there with my boyfriend of three years.  When the moment finally came and they started playing Cosmic, I didn’t even take out my phone. I just wanted to live in that moment. I leaned back into him, he wrapped his arms around my waist, and we slowly swayed together to the rhythm. The concert was deep in a forest, far from the city, so the stars above us were shining bright and clear.  As we listened to Cosmic, under a sky full of stars, with his arms around me — it became one of the most unforgettable moments of my life.  Thank you, Avenged Sevenfold, for giving us that memory. I'll carry it with me forever. 💫🥳
When you see it
2050 anyone?
Wrocław 2025!!! That song sounds amazingly explicit live!
istg this sounds like smth out of the voidz
Semogga kita masih hidup di tahun 2080❤❤❤❤
My mom passed away suddenly last month. When this video released, we watched and listened together and talked about what the video means and symbolizes. Now I just hope that one day we’ll meet again and I can talk to her, and tell her how much she means to me. I love you, mom.
Another amazing classic song after another not one bad song or album much love ❤ rock on 🤘
holy mushroom trip
This song was a pure disappointment
Te amo pra sempre meu Avenged Sevenfold ❤
NOOOO I MISS YOU MOM! TYSM A7x!!!!!!! IMI CRYING
God its so beautiful. Its a massive, epic, deeply emotional song. It just gets more beautiful as it goes. Then it turns into the music that will play as our planet is finally choked of life, and we watch the end approach with a smile.
You're not Avenged Sevenfold Russia or Fn Hunter Biden!
THIS IS POGGERS ''W''
2045 anyone?
After a few first listen, I though the chorus part is about a human soul, that reincarnates endlessly. But now I realized it's also abouth Death itself. It is everywhere, even in the cold, vast space ("rings of dust and ice, weightless in the night"). I almost laughed out loud, when the Reaper flipped that hourglass over at the end, to start again. Genius lyrical work and clip here, this is the evolution of A7X. Thank you.
2030 anyone?
2040 Anyone?
I keep someone in this song who has gone flying high united among the cosmic free and without any more pain that he suffered here ☺️his wounds are healed yes he is smiling in heaven now
I just cried fron watching a skeleton with no facial expression dancing....
watching in 1991 this shit crazy yall
This song is sooooo good, I wish this song had more views, its genuinely one of their best songs originally made by them, I say its almost as great as their older songs, Definitely good writing and somewhat scary thoughts before its Your time, But its so heartwarming to imagine.
2035 anyone?
I demand an action/adventure videogame with these characters.
2026 anyone?
The nerve of this band to say they didnt think this one would be a banger. To think it could've never happened is insane
selalu dihati
I need this son to last 10 more minutes!
Essa é a música mais linda do album❤❤❤❤❤ avenged sevenfold sempre arrasando como sempre ❤❤❤❤❤ amando meus meninos a 13 anos ❤

Classic drum finale. Pair it with epic. love it

Como eu amo essa banda ❤
мистер дудец уже не тот =)
Avenged Sevenfold: hey guys, lets make a cool song and throw in many genres of rock!
As a fan of A7X since city of evil before being obsessed with Rush,king crimson and Pink floyd, just the fact that one of my favourite bands growing up, is going prog since 2016 with exist and jiw this..... Brings tears to my eyes.
My favorite song across all the albums, incomparable to any other; a masterpiece!
So slow and borred x1000
Youtube knows im a huge ax7 fan and hasnt directed me to this gem.  I had to hear from the band themselves in a short about it to even know.
This song is tripy AF!!!, love every minute of it, the best in the whole album!, must have been reading every comment crying.... there youll find me!!!......Let it go!!!!!. It hits so hard to everyone who lost someone they love.
I wish I could be close to my mother I would give my arms and legs to spend a day with her again
Seru bgtt co
I love you a7x
Altas dorgas 😂
This song will go down in history for sure… rest in peace to everyone that’s unfortunately lost loved ones.. untill we meet again! ❤
After my Brother was murdered, this song/video became everything. Gets me every time 😢 Thank you A7X.
Selamat lebaran, semoga diampuni dosa² kita dan dilancarkan rezekinya

I saw this a year ago today when it came out. Mind BLOWN
album bom demais <3
They played this as their final song at a concert I went to last year and I’ll admit I cried. One of the most beautiful experiences of my life and I’ll never forget it. Thank you a7x 🥺
So Far Away released shortly after my best friend passed & it was my song to her. Haven't been able to listen to it since my brother unexpectedly passed a yr ago bc I'm not ready for it to rip my heart out. Then I listened to this & ffs, it ripped my heart out worse!!  😭😭😭
Espero verlos este 11 de Octubre 2025 en México🟩🔳🟥
If anyone is into reincarnation, the "none too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever, I'll follow you" part hits hard.
Wtf happened to this once great band....
2054 anyone?
The joys and pain of life. This song once brought me joy because It was playing while I was looking at a comet a few months ago. At the time, I felt it was a sign that everything was going to be ok when doctors told my wife and I that our first child was not going to form. The following week dr said it was a miracle and our baby boy was growing normally and healthy.   Now, I’m listening because my dad passed away from cancer last night. He was my best friend and we went to so many concerts together. He always said we must’ve been best friends in a previous life. I’m in so much pain. He’ll never meet my son. As I listen to this song now I only hope that crossing over was as beautiful of an experience for him as this song depicts. I hope he’s in peace and is living his favorite memories. I hope he watches over me and my family. I hope he isn’t alone and knows how much he is loved. I love you Dad. Until we meet again.

This song makes me feel like everything is gonna be ok when we die.  Life is full of stress and ups & downs but in the end we will be at peace for eternity.

Avenged sevenfold is the most musically talented band I've ever heard. Bar none.
Gonna be honest, I've never really had a general "favorite song". This song has kinda turned into that for me ❤
ПРЕКРАСНО  ! ! !
Opening ad card packs in ALU. Also, collecting free blueprints by watching ads.
Does this give anyone Kanye's My dark twisted fantasy vibes?
Asphalt Legends Unite suits this song so much.

No question this is the best song on the album some of those slow spoken sections in songs just sound bad but this is probably the best ballot since so far away it would be nice to here live
Shivaaaaaaaaa
Thank you Asphalt Legends 😂😂

thats so cool!!!!!
You wake up and realize your life in on repeat, day in and day out, an serpent doomed to chase its own tail.  This fact drives you to insanity, you try to escape, but the loop continues, after death you wake up in a new life thats only SLIGHTLY different then the one you were in, hardly noticable.  You keep trying until you realize its not a joke, you panic and the inner beast takes over. You begin the loop of this torment from your own awareness.   Theres only 1 way out. Follow the Morning Star.  This eternity is whatever you make it.   Thankyou @AvengedSevenfold for such a deeply Alchemical message.  You have done GREAT WORK towards waking humanity up.   One giant fist up in Salute to you and the band!
It's like your in my head.
My song ❤ 2024 🫶 😇 🤘

Man... The end of that video is crushing. That's my worst fear.
This is such a beautiful song makes me think of my mother who was my best friend I miss her so much it hurts every day ❤

I come here because asphalt legends unite😅
Asphalt Legends Unite
This song and this album as a whole capture what words and emotions truly cant express yet this album does it perfectly, this album is me
asphalt  legends unite Love you Cosmic Love you ❤❤❤
who came here from asphalt legends unite
Pure masterpiece of a song!! So emotional, the mother of my 4 year old daughter died when our daughter was only 9 months old. This reminds me that there she is watching us, even though we can't see her.
man, I just heard this song in the game Asphalt legends.... I came here because I wanted to see if the game version was different from the release.  THis is some seriously great songwriting and insane musicianship. I Definitely think this would be the greatest song of the last 20 years, if if that guitar solo had not have been put after the first verse. It kinda kills the "Peak" of the song. Like seriously the other parts of the song are so awesome... and the solo is fucking outrageous (!!!!!!!!!) it just blows the song's load WAAAAAAY too soon. Premature ejaculation.   Jeez... guitar players!  sometimes y'all gotta step that ego aside and let the song breathe boys... How about a re-edit, but the solo at the end... save this masterpiece. It's too fucking great to have such a wart on it
Who's here from asphalt legends?
Asphalt Legends thank you for bringing me to this masterpiece! 🥹🔥

Only Evenged Sevenfold can make me cry every song😢
How does this only have 2.2 million view's 😂.  This is deffiantly top 3 songs on the album.
This is exactly the kind of imagery I would have whenever I listened to this song. The flying through space, the rainbows, everything. Blowing my mind! 🥹
This song have the same vibe as Coldplay song “Coloratura”
Fade from all that was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win, and time again, we try Left alone, I can't wait too long, fade Love, we loved so many times And in so many lives, sometimes we got it right Pain, it found its way back in Until we meet again into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you Dancing in the wind as roses born again There, you'll find me Before the dawn of man, in castles made of sand There, you'll find me Writing in the caves as fire lights the way There, you'll find me Mask of royal glow, don in pharaoh's clothes There, you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice, weightless in the night There, you'll find me, let it go Dancing in the wind as roses born again There, you'll find me Before the dawn of man, in castles made of sand There, you'll find me Writing in the caves as fire lights the way There, you'll find me Mask of royal glow, don in pharaoh's clothes There, you'll find me From all that was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win, and time again, we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone), sometimes we got it right It found its way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone), into that good...
This song has the dark side of the moon vibes
❤❤❤❤❤
Hahahahah
To me this to me feels as if though the song is a tribute to Bray Wyatt. I feel that this would be a song that would come from his mind of music and creativity. Also if you were to take parts of his wrestling career you could really and easily make a video with the song playing with his greatest moments.  I also love how I’m hearing a little bit of everything that you can do with music, guitar, bass and drums of course, but brass, violin, piano and even a little audio tune in the background. Love it.
Nessa parte (3:29), me arrepio todas as vezes.
Was a stunning experience watching you guys playing this one on Rock In Rio 2024. I couldn't hold my tears although being kind dehydrated due the long wait on the festival. For sure it will be my top1 song on spotify wrap this year. Thank you so much for this master piece
A.I., write the most generic post-Rev A7X song Ive ever heard. Please and thank you.
This song will be hypnotic with an anc buds or headphones
Let it go

Man, what happened to A7X? Their songwriting used to be incredible and this is like some highschool garage band shit lol.
It's hard nota cry when i listen this great song
My friend since elementary school loved your stuff. I'm glad I can watch it for both of us
That beach scene reminds me of finally making it to see a Pacific sunset.   Being used to the Atlantic it was a special treat.
LISTEN THIS SONG IN ROCK IN RIO 2024 WAS AWESOME! JUST LIKE I'VE IMAGINED!
I don't know why but this video and song and solo gave me vibes of Mike Oldfield. In a very good way of course. 😍
This song represent that A7X generations not young anymore, we are old guys 😅
alv
This song and video is utterly incredible. Just beautiful, majestic, thought-provoking, moving and captivating all in one. I am in awe.
THATS FUCK  UP
This is immense
Masterpiece!!!!
Loving more and more this song, please play it in vxr 2025 lima peru , i will see you guys 🎉❤
I know it’s not death but had a drug problem and was getting kicked out of the half way house and wasn’t allowed to go home. My gf moved to SC and I was going to move there bc she was the only option I had. I heard Afterlife one my last night at the job I was leaving.   Cause this time I'm right to move on and on Far away from here Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you This place full of peace and light And I'd hope you might take me back inside When the time is right  I did end up moving back home with my now wife and kids. I know that’s not what they meant in the song but at the time, those words meant a lot!
🖤
What a video! 🤩

LYRICS:   Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade  Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
I’ve been struggling with chronic SI for years and years and I could never find a purpose in life, but when I learned I could sing So Far Away flawlessly, I was inspired to practice and become a musician myself. Now I can sing this song and Acid Rain. This song particularly is what I sing before work everyday to put myself in the mood to be alive. I am so deep into the song it makes me emotional sometimes. Thank you for giving me a newfound purpose and a reason to feel alive
4:37 give me radiohead vibe :)

The REV : Look, it even works without me <3
All of you avenged Sevenfold had came so far by living in your car to being stars of the stars. This album is the greatest album you made ever. I am Katie basfords boyfriend. We both have your shirts on
This could possibly be my new favorite since I Won't See You Tonight Part 1.
This gives me chills, what a masterpiece
a nice flashback to buried alive
Dancing skeleton and  alll  you guys rule
Hey avenged sevenfold you have changed our life.
The rev would have loved this. Rip to the Rev. We miss you so much man.its like he is still there.❤❤❤❤.
You guys rule big time with this album. 7 years in the  making. It's my favorite album of all times
My friend has a 8 month old baby and I sang her the middle part of this song and she had a big smile. I dedicate this to my mom who died in front of my eyes from Covid. You guys are friends with my girlfriend Katie Basford. I wear your shirts now.
So calm when I play this music
I found this song so relatable to the movie cloud atlas
Why is everyones loved one dying in this comment section?
this is what life is about here, a journey through everything in search of the light
Melhor musica do álbum, simplesmente fantástica!
The lyrics 'until we meet again into that good night' from Avenged Sevenfold's Cosmic resonate deeply with me. They remind me of my husband, who passed away three years ago. This song feels like a comforting reminder that, in some cosmic way, we will meet again. Until then, I'll hold onto the hope that our souls will reunite in the vast expanse of the universe
1:50 2:04
where its OLD A7X???
❤❤
Absolute masterpiece
Relaxing❤
another masterpiece, thank you!!!! <3
Do y’all know how emotional this song is? I was able to pull my daughter up to the front of the pit when this song was played in May and it meant the world to her, the first time she heard the album she envisioned her baby brother who… is no longer with us, and her Vincent who also passed… she saw them dancing together in heaven, to us , this song helps us cope with death … ❤❤❤❤❤💙🕉️💚🕉️💜🕉️
THIS ALBUM IS A MASTERPIECE
Imagine falling in love with a girl that’s taken. I hate it. I’m a dummy. But the line “until we meet again,” maybe in another life.
Plis comeback Indonesia😢😢😢
Good song. Comments are stupid crybaby bitches.
best of the best song dari semua album
Anyone here is 2025?
Just beautiful 😢
Third try, and it's terrible. Someone save A7X from their head in rectum problem
this is brilliant
Proposed to my fiance during this song at Rocklahoma this year. This song has absolutely changed my life in more ways than one, thank you avenged sevenfold 🤘🏼
You guys should come to Alaska and play 😎

When you're gone, you leave forever. There will never be another rendition of you. Do you join something greater? Do you return to dust? Cosmic gives you hope that there is something greater. Death is not the end.
Essa música é maravilhosa 🥹
🕺🕺🕺🏿
Love the piano part! Reminds me of daggets camp in bola! The most beautiful sunrise you can ever see
Im going through a hard time in my job, like working plus 10 hours a day. I want to cry every single time, but couldnt because of the anxiety. Today, after I listened this song, I cryed a little. Thank you for that moment, a7x
I wish the song ended in 4:58 :( it will be the greatest song of the album
What in the Pink Floyd am I watching 😂
Min 3:12 lo mejor para mirar hacia el techo recostado pensando que la vida es impresionante y maravillosa mientras recuerdas el tiempo perdido y te animas ....🥹
I used to think posts about the loss of loved ones was pretty cringe. This was over a decade ago and I no longer feel the same so please don't misunderstand. I guess I was lucky, not having lost anyone since I was a teenager (45 now), but it seems like once the loss started, that it just has not stopped for me. Ive lost multiple loved ones just this year alone.  The one thing I have learned is that this is the one thing we will ALL have in common no matter what race, religion, political leanings, or any other divide you can think of. It's something we must all learn to live with and it will never be easy to do so. Death is the great unifier. It may be painful for us who have to live with the loss but it isbeautiful for the ones who pass and undergo the greatest journey of their lives.  So if it makes you feel better to post a comment about it, rest assured that those of us in the know will read your comments with great diligence, compassion and understanding. If you're onthe fence just go for it. Feel better. Seek closure. Gain support, even if it is from a stranger. You don't have to be alone with these struggles.  ❤
Que música linda é fodaaaaa
Anyone september 2024
Godbless💜
The talent of this band will never cease to impress me
Ja pensou Linkin park e A7X juntos com uma música séria épico

Song kinda has to go with the video. Then it’s very enjoyable. Song doesn’t stand as good on its own. Besides the awesome soloing of course
Man.. the bit where death walks along the sunset is a strong feeling.
Thing song reminds me of the band Muse.

There goes my hero.
Sorry but Avenged Sevenfold died with Jimmy. Hail to the King as cool and safe, but everything they’ve released after that is just haphazard garbage with no flow
The best way i can put it is that this is my comfort song This has gotten me through so much shit and its so special to me This whole album got me through the toughest parts of my life and currently carrying me through one now. And something about Cosmic stuck out and just resonated with me. A7x foREVer. Love yall.
I am just so happy we all get to exist at the same time as this wonderful song. Wow. I love you, Avenged Sevenfold.
we love you A7x😢😢😢
I'm glad I'm alive to listen to this masterpiece in this lifetime 🌌

This song always gets me emotional, A7x was my favorite band and i wanted to see you live, both chula vista shows supposed to be my very first time (nearest venue for me) and both got canceled. Both with pit tickets.   I'm assuming I'll never be able to hear you live, not even this unbelievable song, maybe in another life
Pues... Mi Mejor Amigo Me A Dejado... Y Escucho Esta Cancion Muy Seguido... No Se Que Me Pasa...
Thank you Gavin for introducing me to this song. You're an amazing nephew 😍
This song brings me so much solace and comfort when I think of the ones I lost ❤
Holy sh*t cosmic in nice clip and song
Just a simple thanks guys. Needed what you made and have made.
THIS SONG MOVES ME TO MY SOUL. THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW AMAZING THIS IS
Crezy intro🫀
The best fades,the best lyrics,the best song,the best horns,the video,the editing, this is an absolute masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!
🇮🇩
Now we need official live music video on this masterpiece
This song is perfec
My wife and I went to their concert in Manchester NH this past winter & they closed the show with this song. The lights/lasers mixed with everyone dancing around & just having a good time was truly one of the most euphoric feelings I’ve ever felt. Not gonna lie, even got a bit emotional. A7x FoREVer!! 💀 🦇
This is a masterpiece. Love everything about it. A story, sounds beautiful, great solo, 3 songs in one. And it evokes emotion. Amazing
HO-LY SHIT!
I guess I can’t make another famous burger… when ads deplore an artist. Rock on AX7… your music is underrated as hel
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍♥️😉😘👍
I love you a7x always ❤
This song has given me hope. All life
You have to hear this part 4:59 - 5:11 very impressive

ครั้งแรกที่ได้ฟัง ฉันสัมผัสได้ถึงบางอย่าง คล้ายว่านั่นคือจุดสิ้นสุดของการเดินทางด้วยดวงจิตของเรา บทสรุปของชีวิตที่เกิดขึ้นมา ดีใจ เสียใจ เศร้า เหงา คิดถึง ปวดร้าว ช่วงเวลาที่เลวร้าย ไม่ว่าจะยังไง ไม่ยอมแพ้ และพยายามเข้าถึงสิ่งนั้น สิ่งที่จะพาเราไปยังต้นกำเนิดเดิมแท้ที่เราจากมา แสงที่ริบหรี่ค่อยๆปรากฏขึ้น และใช่ การเดินทางนี้มาถึงจุดสิ้นสุดแล้ว สิ้นสุดเสียที จะไม่มีอีกต่อไป เป็นดั่งเดิม คงเดิมชั่วนิจนิรันดร์    ______________________________  ฉันอยากรู้ว่า พวกคุณได้ทำนองจังหวะพวกนี้มาได้อย่างไร ได้มาจากสิ่งที่อยู่ภายในเหรอ หรือพวกคุณและโปรดิวเซอร์เข้าถึงบางสิ่งบางอย่างทางด้านศิลปะดนตรี ท่วงทำนองที่น่าพิศวงนี้ ปลุกฉันขึ้นมา จิตวิญญาณที่ตื่นขึ้น
Nice❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Man, that skeleton dancing really made me emotional. This was the last song I listened with my mom before cancer took her. And she always danced in a similar manner to get a funny reaction from our dog. This song, and now the video, will always hold a special place in my heart. Thank you
We love you Rev
Aku suka a7x 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
My wife and I saw them live in NJ this past April. When this part was played at the concert, we danced along with everyone in the pit. Such a beautiful moment that I will never forget. Can’t wait to see them again.

To the dudes in 9th grade who said listen to 3 days grace instead of avenged sevenfold, you was mad wrong, even 11 years later, fuck y’all, you suck
Really solid choice as a closing song guys. Saw you at download and held back tears as i belted this out. Thankyou for everything over the years, it was a pleasure seeing you guys live <3
Broooookkkkkk..... is that you, ?  Iyo ho ho ho ho ho
Don't get me wrong Cosmic was amazing but A7X should stick to what they do best
A7X rocks all the time. I LOVE YOU GUYS. HOPE TO VISIT PHILIPPINES and be part of your concert.
This is terrible
This makes all the good before sound bad

He is. I feel him in everything they do. Very special
I agree!!! Rev would be incredibly satisfied that his departure has only inspired the boys to keep working on some awesome works!! This band is truly special! That's how us native South Cali's Roll right??  !! Bravo!!!  BRAVO!!!
You boys are just so talented, so deep, it's beautiful to listen to your original works.  I'll hold Cosmic close when it's my time. I believe God would enjoy a listen to some real melodic music from Avenge! Thankyou  for the inspirational moments your music has brought to my life. Love and respect always,            Judi Alvarez ( retired ,songwriter/keyboardist)
Hace tanto tiempo que no me emocionaba tanto una canción, hasta el punto de llorar de tan perfecta que es, gracias Avenged Sevenfold 🖤
This song, the lyrics, the transitions, the solo. Chills, all the time, everytime. ❤
Man I love this cd. The whole thing is an emotional rollercoaster.
Easily my favorite song on the album wish y’all could’ve played it on the tour
Hey Rev, my buddy of 40 plus years has passed. Think you can show him around. He's kinda Goofy but a pretty good gutair player. RIP Stanly (Butch) Panzak..😢😢😢

Dancing in the wind as roses born again, there you’ll find me…
I find this to be one of the most beautiful a7x songs that they have ever made. I saw them at download festival for the first time a week ago and it was such an amazing show, and they finished off with this song, I decided what a better time to crowd surf for the first time, and I’m not ashamed to say that I left sobbing, the amount of emotions that ran through me was INSANE. This song will forever have a special little place in my heart !
يا إلهي لقد كان اجمل ما سمعت على الاطلاق شكرا جزيلا
Cool
Thanks you
Thanks! A7X
Waiting for CrimsonDay
Indonesia selalu menanti kalian kembali ❤
Life is but a dream... Enjoy it while you can remember it..
Matap mang🔥 I am Indonesian
This song is a masterpiece
greatest song oat
Old a7x was way better than what this whole album was….
My fav song
The best ever song i ever Heard until i play it over and over again 🔥❤️
I just feel beyond proud and honored to be an A7X fan, i feel it was no coincidence i fell in love with their music, and years later they release these songs with such a deep and meaningful spiritual content. They see the whole picture, all that's ever happened, that's happening and will happen, exists all at the same time, but we are only able to experience one second at a time, we return and we leave, and we return again, until our conciousness has evolved enough to ascend, and we have to acknowledge the love we find each time we are here, it's the only way to keep climbing. A journey through time and space, that resonates in all of us through this song. That's what Cosmic is. Beautiful. Thank you Avenged Sevenfold.
Masterpiece
Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade  Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
This song is a masterpiece, gotta play this song on every important occasion in my life. Thank you AX7 for composing such an impeccable piece of art for us🎉❤
Best song on the album. Let’s stick to the melodic goth bois
👍
I like this songgg after listening 4times this song was in my head
those guitar solo scream got me emotional
ada yang ngrasa ini lagu kesufian dengan alam semesta? "kelahiran baru" setelah mengalami sisi gelap. dan bahasa romansa dengan semesta.
Aku tak mengerti arti bahasanya tapi inilah lagu yang bisa terdengar menarik perasaan kedalam suasana  yang berbeda beda dalam mengikuti  aliran sungai keruh dan beningnya air disepanjang berjalannya waktu hingga suara itu hilang

😢 very emotional mr skeleton ❤❤❤

What the hell happened to his voice?
The way I enjoy this song has no sense. Every single time I listen to it gives me shackles from the second 0. One of the best songs ever made by the human being.
as a music producer , this song production is out of the box .
I dont know how to headbanging this song
Best song in the album LiBaD 👍
Man the reason they changed their sound is because the lead singers voice is gone. And has been gone for yrs so this is what we get now 😢
Amazing A7X, I'm From Indonesia
Always a fan, but this song has something *extra* to it.   Good story.  Awesome flow. great for playing on repeat
This is definitely Avenged Sevenfold's Touch (Daft Punk)
UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN....
plis back to indonesia again guys :)))
Where The Rev?
I thought of Jimmy the second I heard this song.  Is it normal it made me cry?   Definitely a one in a million songs, and so different to what Avenged Sevenfold made in the past, but jesus.. this song really gives me hope, and motivates me to keep going in life. Thank you so so so much A7X.   And to just get to know it now, a year later… but I will see them in COPENHELL in 10 days. I’m so so excited 🥹🥹🥹
Wow, this is an amazing song - up there with some of the greatest rock bands of all time imo like Pink Floyd meets the Beatles caliber! Best A7X evolution so far 😮
I hear Marty Friedman on this song...❤❤❤
I close my eyes... Whats a good trip❤ It wasn't a fase, mom❤lml
Saya dari Indonesia, dari umur saya masih 7 tahun, hingga saat ini usia saya 22 tahun hampir tiap hari Saya muter lagu²nya Avenged Sevenfold 🔥
This is masterpiece
I've just heard this song for the first time, and i'm very love this so much, a complete package of music, sad, mellow, chill, excitement, OUTRAGEOUS, after "Seize The Day" for my benchmark, this really easy to recomend for all people who interested to A7X
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Incredibly brilliant. Feeling the intensity for sure. Shine in and out! Shine on!🌟🌈🦄
Terimakasih avenged sevenfold sudah datang ke indonesia dan terimakasih sudah mencintai indonesia❤🇮🇩

Ladies and Gentleman enjoy this Holy Music  Avenged Sevenfold - Cosmic  Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade  Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good

You're older stuff was much better. I appreciate the arrangements and melodies of the newer music, but this isn't what I'm looking for from you guys. I only wish you're pain heals, it's been more evident over time.
Beautiful song from the beautiful album 🖤

Cosmic
Beautiful song
Please comeback in Indonesia
I love you from Indonesia!!!
Thanks, from indonesia
Cosmic mengubah hidup saya menjadi lebih baik. Meskipun saya masih setatus lajang. Sebaliknya fans sejati disini rata2 sudah mempunyai keluarga. Dan 1lagi lagu ini keluar disaat ayah saya sudah tiada tahun 2021. Salam hormat dari a7x family indonesia. 😉😉
this song, pure cosmic
A7x's songs are always good How can we forget...it's impossible to forget
❤
I came back here because he contacted me through a video call. He said 2 months ago a7x had a new song released, then I remembered it's been a long time since I heard a7x's song, then I came back here and felt like repeating the beautiful things together with him.
oke om
so remember the song Warmness on the Soul
Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good

Keren
Setelah tahu Artinya Avenged Sevenfold ngeri juga Pembalasan 7 kali.
Coba part terakhir dibuat agak teriak2, daripada pake efek gtu. Padahal lagunya bagus, ending nya kurang 🫠
Awesome🔥🤤
Indonesia menyala abangku🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Part melodynya kayak lagu slow rock tahn 90an indo yaitu Nike Ardilah
Amazing song 🖤 indonesian peoples always love a7x 🇮🇩💀🦇
Menyala Abang ku 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I sad …i didn't get concert tickets 25 mei in jakarta😭😭😭😭😭😭😭please come back in indonesia
Hot take, I'm good if LIBAD is like a7x magnum opus amd they decide to do other things with their lives... or just keep making the music they want. I f*ckin& love that album, the concert too 😊
Sinister + petruci = cosmic
Semoga taun depan bisa manggung diindonesia lg aamiin
This is the best song, but so hard processing
The Rev... Let's be honest...
Excellent rock and metal radio station. Google it: "shogun rocks laut"  Have fun!!!!!!
Im in love with this song at the 1st time i hear it
I had my dog euthanized yesterday....she had cannine distemper...back bidy paralysis... infected Mount...she was suffering and i called the shot....there is guilt obviously.....regret..
I hope you can come back to Indonesia, I really enjoyed your show last night, greetings from Indonesia

I loved an Egyptian woman at one point. Donned in pharaohs clothes.   I wish I could see u again, and I love knowing you're  happy.   I didn't get it right this time.
This band has a small dick and long balls.
Patah hati kesekian kali karna ndk bisa nnton mereka d Indonesia 😢

Ill be honest, i did not enjoy the new album, with the exception of this song. Its a masterpiece. In their top 3 forsure. Might even be number 1.
Anyone may,22, 2024?

I can't hold my tears 😭 this song is so wholesome
Amazing song and just how everything was well put together you can definitely still feel Matt  and all of them are  still missing there brother The Rev in this one
Midnight the rev
Current avenged sevenfold is turning into old school DragonForce
Doesn’t matter how many times I hear this song but I always end up a blubbering mess 😢
perfeita!
thank you a7x for giving me so much joy, in my darkest times your music gave me hope and made me grateful for being alive. Thank you for making part of my life for more than 10 years 💜💙
Que bonita música 😎
What an absolute masterpiece
The best song...
This fye
Idk if its youtubes compression, but this sounds so different from the album version. My brain and ears hear Jimmy in this.
Tq
💫🖤
Someone make sure this is played at my funeral, never really felt anything other than joy when listening to this band, but this song sparked everything single emotion
❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉

25 may live in indonesia🥹🙌🙌
Avenged sevenfold... is old.. and immortal.
Been listening for decades, i am of the opinion that this is their best song ever, and that's a pretty high bar tbh.
A7x meets the Voidz..❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The music video, top notch. The lyrics, profoundly deep. The song, amazing. Thank you A7X for bringing us into this amazing journey of self-reflection through your music.
The solo that begins at 2:00 is sooo Steven Wilson... So beautiful...
I'm an old dude 😉. Synyster is godlike. So beautiful. 🤘🏼♥️
😇🌟💖🌟💋🤗💫💯😢🍩🚬👼🎙
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My dad passed away in October.. he went missing.. I went to a A7X concert in Abq .. he went to the one in PHX.. apparently he was dealing with things we didn’t know.. he drank himself to death after his concert.. I remember him asking me and my brother over phone “ hey sons can u get me a shirt of the tour dates.. I don’t have enough rn.. you guys are going to the Abq concert “ my dad was found a week after his concert wearing his a7x shirt with a bottle in his hand… sometimes it’s hard to believe or comprehend.. but he’s gone.. and a I have to accept it.. I just miss him so fucking much.. the Skelton dancing into cosmic beauty reminds me of him…
😍😍😍
PERFECT SONG 😭😭
so fucking im crying
Mantap lagunya....👍🏻
Words cannot describe how I love this album ❤
your work is very good, brother, im like A7X, and thank you for entertaining us fans, thank you very much, Avenged Sevenfold is very good, I greet you from Indonesia 🙏❤
I always relate this to The Rev.. ❤💔🌠🌌
Artine apa mbuh ora nggenah
A clusterfuck of emotions, and I'm loving it!
Mom passed away the day before her birthday after a 2 year long battle with cancer. The last six weeks of her life were tough but she had so much love from everyone she knew I'm sure in some way that aspect was enjoyable. I watched her take her last breath her lifeless eyes were filled with life when she broke through. She saw heaven.... I'll never forget that. this song is such an accurate portrayal of the last moments gives me chills hearing it after the fact. Miss you mom hope your dancing and singing Beverly hillbillies up there!
This FKN GUITAR SOLO man! Coming and going like if each one was a different life. Man I dont know if they made it on purpose, but it hits right on the spot.
TheOne Who makes me emotional
🖤🩶💫🌌🪐🧑🏻‍🚀
<3
727 WYSI
The most epic, emotional goodbye song ever. I am addicted to Kratom, and quit two days ago. As I’m going through severe withdrawals, I realized I’m not just missing the substance, but who I was while I was using. It made me a better person at times, and especially helped me out with my kids. It made me happier, and helped me get through a lot. A part of me died with quitting, a part that I will miss and will never forget. It was the death of a loved one, a part of me. The loved one is gone, but dancing in the wind, as roses born again, there you’ll find me - that part of me that I loved lives on in spirit. Gone, but never forgotten. Super emotional, and this song expresses the loss of loved ones perfectly to me. It’s also has the perfect amount of ambiguity, so people can derive their own meaning from it.   Thank you for this - it has helped me more than you’ll know. ❤
How did they from constant bangers, to this shit.
A7x in infonesia consert
Avangad savenflod go to in jakarta may

Terus lah berkarya abangku 🔥
Love you guys so much
Van Halen cover?
Avenged Sevenfold is one of the best rock bands in history. They’ve been at it for over a quarter of a century and only getting better and better.
I like how avenge sevenfold went from Metal rock music to clam relaxing music
Belo som porém meu top 3 albuns do AX7 são :  1º THE STAGE (Disparado...) 2º NIGHTMARE 3º AVENGED SEVENFOLD
There should've been at least one half time breakdown on the drums in this song. Missed opportunity. 👍
This is pure art...Right square in the feels.
This song is so wonderful, beyond masterpiece. Let's share this song to everyone!!! 🤘
Aku teringat neneku yg sudah lama meninggal 😢😢
Oh dear god, someone told AX7 about spicy chords . . . 😂
10/10 for this .. <3
This needs more exposure to the mainstream.
Desde Argentina 🇦🇷 ❤
Every single time I listen to this song, I get so emotional. No other song has really done that. 7 years I wouldn’t be alive, and I’m here now. The skeleton dancing to the sunset was that peace, love and happiness I felt when I shortly felt the other side. Thank you guys, for replicating that, it’s so beautiful. ❤️
Got to see this in the 4D album release at Arear 51 in Las Vegas and this song blow my mind.  Song is absolutely mind blowing
My word. I don't even know what to say.  "Then don't say anything. Just play the damn song!"
This song makes me remember the feeling at the first time i found A7X back in 2011 when i was in junior high school and starting to listen to every song. Like my fav is warmness on the soul, i wont see you tonight part 1, dear god, seize the day, beast and the harlot, blinded in chains, dancing dead, demons, not ready to die, etc.. i dont know it just feel so nostalgic 🥲
To my favorite people, Myles and Sierra
Masterpiece!!!!
new feeling but im feeling it in my soul  sounds like a7x remastered/remixed but im up for it!!!
the answer is the quran
There’s just something so special about this song and the record as a whole. Down to the silly little dance the  skeleton does to the way he flips the hour glass at the end.  God it’s so good
Yogyakarta goooooo 25 may
Lo mire solamente 1 vez, y vasto para lograr llorar de alegría, y entender que soy todo y nada al mismo tiempo 🖤
see you all 25th at Jakarta :))
What an amazing song. The video is close to what I imagined it would be - a journey through space and time. I love the multiple crescendos. Some of their finest work. Syn hits some really emotive notes that hit you hard.
Man!, This should've been uploaded on the golden records of both Voyager 1 & 2!
Demi waktu by The Time
Time machine? Hourglass? Candle's? Skeleton? Faces? Eyes? Dancing? Sunset? Galaxy's?  The answer is: Moment, age, place, & waiting, when a happy day's will become. Uhh....😮‍💨
Anime Ending
As a 2 years experience electric guitar player the guitar solo is about 50/100 possible to played
Cant stop crying. Lost my dad a few months ago and I just can’t handle this song
This is going to be one of these songs/videos we’ll be coming back to 10-20 years later and it’ll still be just as epic.
Caraca a parte b dessa música.  Quando o piano toca e a caveira dançando na frente do mar ... é emocionante
LET IT GOOOOOOOOO
Yang setuju lagu ini keren 😢❤
pin
TOQUEM ESSA MUSICA NO ROCK IN RIO 2024!!!
Sejam bem vindos ao Brasil
I feel peaceful
Jeez. Was waiting for ffdp or like a livelier (for the most part) band to come through on the beat, but.
I started listening A7x since i was 14 years old, now i'm 31, man how i love this band, Very emotional Song ❤❤ Ggs to all of you from Nicaragua
too many sound efects, we want more instrumental, not more ugly effects
Thank you ❤
Skeleton dancing, me crying ❤ lol
This is pretty much what I imagine going through while listening to this song. Especially with him slowly drifting into space and then BANG!
Avenged in Rock in Rio. Confirmed

My God, this song is simply magnificent. Perfect
Such a beautiful song that in my opinion personifies finding peace and grace after death. I’m a believer of heaven or “afterlife” and this made think of my beloved grandma who was like a second mother to me. She’s now in peace and soaring away.
No, effing way! Who the eff is telling these patriots
best banget kerennnnnnnnn❤️❤️❤️
It's great, basically this is the song 🔥🔥
From childhood until I grew up listening to avengedsevenflod songs
this hit me in my feels
they can turn a scary skeleton into emotional
HELL YEAH
Like a mew frangers
@5:11 when the drums kick in all the way through  the end it floods me with emotions. Really love this song
يا حليف الإبليس🇮🇱 انفعني بما فعلته بالبشرية، فإن إله العالمين لن يرضى عنك، وهو (إلهك) خاضع لدقة الهمفوز. /m\ 🤘🏻
M.Shadow time spent in a dream looking through my crystal ball eye can see you
Trash for A7X
Avenged Sevenfold meets Dream theather and Pink Floyd.  I love it.
#lifeisbutadream BUT WHAT AMAZING DREAM!
#cosmic
Aku mengenal kan lagu ini ke seseorang sepesial,tapi akhir kita tidak bersama
Dancing in the wind as roses born again  Matt is a lyrical genius
this album is  horrible and and so are his vocals...what happened?
Fuckin sick, best song ever.
Well be ok.. maybe not me or you but we will Def make it through
Death rides in facing the sun, there we have advantage, amongst the rays that were made of
This song makes me think of losing and reuniting (wherever we end up) with my Mom who passed in December 2023. Top 10 A7X of all time.
somehow sounds like hillsong 4:16
Why is your voice so weak, friend, where did you go before?😢😢
The sands of time there's never enough they always fall away.
I have a better idea,  write a song
It's random think about the ripper can have another form?
!!!!!Excellent rock and metal radio station. Google it: "shogun rocks laut"  Have fun!!!!!
best song of the album
Mat shadow harus lihat cover gitaris egois YANK X A7X
Another brilliant track by A7x ...very soulful, deep and layered 👌 wish it could have been even longer to truly be epic prog.
I love the skeleton dancing, It just reminds me to enjoy life as it lasts.
I love Avenged Sevenfold I'm Indoneisa Fans
Vlw apena esperar 15 anos
❤❤❤
I got gooshhbom
this video has exactly the same wonderful vibe as the music, perfect!
Hey, this video took me on a cosmic journey! 🪐💀The visuals, the music, everything was just mind-blowing. Absolutely stunning! 🌌🎶
que música perfeita, simplesmente incrível 😍😍😍😍😍😍

now i know what pharaoh clothes looks like
LYRICS: 🎵🎵🎵  Fade From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye  Fate Has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone, I can't wait too long Fade  Love We loved so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right  Pain It found its way back in Until we meet again Into that good night  None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me Before the dawn of man, in castles made of sand There you'll find me Writing in the caves as fire lights the way There you'll find me Mask of royal glow don in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  Let it go Yeah Rings of dust and ice weightless in the night There you'll find me Let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me Before the dawn of man in castles made of sand There you'll find me Writing in the caves as fire lights the way There you'll find me Mask of royal glow don in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try I'm gone We loved so many times And in so many lives I'm gone Sometimes we got it right I'm gone It found it's way back in Until we meet again I'm gone Into that good
Yuk 🇮🇩
from 4:59 i got some nice daft punk vibe :D
The best song on the album 🤩🫶🔥 💀
I don't normally listen to A7X (but my bro is a fan and showed me this song) and I feel this song SO DEEPLY. The lyrics and especially the music in the second half make me cry every time. It reminds me of the twin flame journey. Looking for the other part of your soul in every life time... "And time again we try/ we loved so many times / and in so many lives/ until we meet again" 💜😭
The Rev smiles down on us all while furiously blasting double-bass!!! 🤘 We will all see him again, I'm sure of it. A7X F-O-R-E-V-E-R!!!
A7x is turning into Dream Theater and I'm all here for it
thx guys, please share more! if you guys ever come to the south of the world will 100% be there front row.
My dad and I were best friends. He was the biggest A7X fan.. he got me into them in 2010. I bought him tickets to go see them in Atlanta in 2018. He passed away from cancer last year in 2023, a month after this song was released. We never listened to this song together, but it feels like he is speaking directly to me in this song. This song is a brilliant representation of Quantum Entanglement, and it truly is such a beautiful thing. Well done A7X, hats off to you guys for creating such a beautiful piece of art. Cheers to everyone else who finds there own meaning in this song.
Play with high quality and dont skip ads
The drum and guitar were really insane
Damn, i started love this song
I feel the song
Bahkan aku tidak bisa berbahasa Inggris, tetapi aku bisa mengikuti perkataan dan nada setiap lagu A7X😂😂❤
Cool video. But hell this could have been fan made.. would have been cooler to see syn playing this solo
A forma como vive os dias determina como é tua jornada entre a vida e a morte - é isso que importa, a jornada. Rotina, ame-a ou se contente em ser um resto de poeira cósmica ainda mais insignificante vagando pelo universo. (Nada detém a inexorável marcha do tempo).
🤔🤮
Dont watch this unless you’re high
New favorite AX7 video for sure
If I listened to this song in my final moments I would be happy.
Someone's gotta say it: this sucks. I hope A7X removes their heads from their butts, but I don't think they can at their age.
There back!!!!!!!! Ten years later. Man... We miss you Rev. Sounds like syn has his emotion back in those strings ..
There is a part where I gave up in. thing to find a mean from something I was looking for. and there was a time when I stopped looking. and the lyrics of this song remind me to keep mancari something behind the meaning that I've been looking for and I gave up. and this song comes back to making that I will definitely find it, over time. sooner or later. This song is true, it makes me very grateful to you guys (Avenged Sevenfold) This song is one of the best I have ever heard.  See you in Indonesia, I will be there to look at you guys, I will stand in the front row, and jump at the highest, screaming at the loudest, Avenged Sevenfold will find me at the concert later.
Hmm...this is not A7x like before 🫤🫤  We miss beast and the harlot music energy 🗿
My forever song...
I love what they did with this.
Everything about this song and video is so so beautiful. Its indescribable how gorgeous both the song and video are. The first time I listened to cosmic it was genuinely like a psychedelic experience. I cried so so much and it was kind of like all the horrible things that had happened to me in my life were just. . .gone. A gargantuan weight had been lifted off of my shoulders.
Absolutely Beautiful
BRAVE!
El día en que salió life is but a dream eran las 2 am en mi país y al día siguiente tenía que levantarme a las 5:30 am para ir a mi trabajo, aunque al día siguiente tuve muchísimo sueño. Escuchar libad en la madrugada fue una experiencia única era solamente yo y la música sin ningún tipo de distracción, en el momento que empezó a sonar cosmic fue uno de los mejores momentos de mi vida tenía la piel de gallina y a cada rato sentía escalofríos por todo el cuerpo en el momento que termino cosmic tuve que parar de escuchar por un momento el album porque fue tanta la emoción que me produjo cosmic que llore y llore sintiendo nostalgia y sabía perfectamente que cosmic es una obra de arte y pude estar vivo en ese momento para escucharlo y ahora qué salió el video la sensación fue la misma, el video es perfectamente como me imaginaba que sería ... Gracias avenged sevenfold por traer libad 💞
Dude a7x got weird
this is a masterpiece. love from argentina
Just found out today Colon cancer took my daddy ...😢
What about Kobe and Shaq
this song genuinely made me cry, so beautiful
Avenged is BACK !!! Menyela Abangkuh... 🔥🔥🔥
I like this music
This is amazing
The organ you hear with a headset on the right ear from  5:34-6:05 is amazing!!!
So Beautiful... See you at Download😊❤
wow ... nice work all the way around
Ate a morte precisa de férias 😅
Soul speaking.I love this band.❤
Thought this was a James Marriott intro.
Definitely miss the ax7
Per me è la canzone più bella dell'album
la lenta reconciliacion con la muerte... y el paso del tiempo que sana esa herida un poco mas...
I wasn't ready for these comments in the comments section. I guess it is going to be one of those days.
One of the most beautiful songs I've heard. The lyrics are also beatiful, about love life & death on a cosmic level.
Synnnn🫠
damn.
❤dad
Menyala abangkuh🔥
Thank you Avenged Sevenfold for being a part of my life❤
I'M GONE.
Synyster's shredding is all I needed today
This part when the skeletton starts to dance makes me crying so hard.🤧 Idk when i cry at last but it Was a long long time i cry at last. Fat respect. I love your Songs❤🤘. I grown up with avenged sevenfold. Idk what i do without your songs man😢
A7X knocked this out of the park one of my favorites! It makes me think about human history, life, and what lies beyond, even makes me think about God too. Very philosophical and ask ourselves what lies beyond what we know
This band is so overrated they suck!
I love the piano too, its totally different in the song,so emotional.
❤❤
Holy shit this is amazing im literally swelling up
🌹
This song was fitting for the fantastic cosmic event we saw today
The perfect closing song for their new setlist. I hope they keep playing it for a long time.
I lost my homie, my bff and heard this song... helped me cope... he was a beautiful soul. I was sad because i got married to the wrong one and that caused us to not speak for many years... we got to hang once and talked on the pho e a few times after my divorce... RIP La Alfred
It's almost bittersweet listening to a band nowadays who is not afraid to show guitar solos with context.
Masterpiece album.. But this song stands above the rest. Thank you guys... from the bottom of my heart. Thank you...
genial !!!
akhirnya comeback juga ❤
Padre quieres a kali te la regalo 📦 tuya para seguirte compitiendo a tu edad vales verga pero si lo que quieres es estar aquí tuya como itzel como evelin como daba como las que escoges para que sigas perdiendo aun no la escojo y es la última creo así hazte más joven
This music has moved me to tears with its power ❤
THIS is the new Avenged Sevenfold song. This is THE song. You know what I'm talking about? Only those who get it will get it but...ya know what I mean? This is it. This is THE new song. Whenever anyone asks you "Hey, what's that band you're always listening to, what's all the hype, why so obsessed?" You show them this. This is THE song.
R.I.P. Tony Abril...  Son, Brother, Husband, Father, Friend.  One day we'll see you again dancing in the wind.
Sweetest skeleton ever known...... 😄
The comforting sound of another's voice. 🙂💜🐾💗
When I see things about A7X I always remember The Rev😢, a great drummer, a great songwriter, and backing vocalists with amazing voices. The songs written by the rev are always badass and if he were alive now he would be the world's best drummer. rip the rev
good luck bro
Perfect likes perfect love for you awe.
I WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE TO PUT A COUPLE OF THEIR OTHER SONGS WITH THIS VIDEO😘🌈🙏🌈😇
I just love EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BAND,AND THEY'RE VIDEOS😘🙏
are the hourglasses a discworld reference
Cosmic might be one of the best songs they've ever made.
This song makes me miss my mom
Imagine how amazing this would have been if it was in the VR Concert!!
Beyond Forever
Luv the dramatic action. It feels just like a fantasy. Fantastic. Thank you
The worst A7X song, the drum sound is very poor, I can't feel anything. The guitar solo is just ordinary shredder style.
In the summer im dancing on a beach to this song
COSMIC!
6:40  right here 😫
My gerbil Binky passed away last week.  I can't help but choke back the tears when hearing this song, and thinking of Binky.  Binky died of prostate cancer, and although his life was hard...I imagine him in heaven now, crawling up the Rev's pant leg, and singing Cosmic with him. Naw.... this song sucks.  The video sucks.  All the emo comments to this video suck.  Do better A7X.
Definitely my favourite song of the album, and top 3 best songs of the band!!! So glad and grateful  to listen this masterpiece. Kind regards from Argentina!!  ❤
This song, for some reason, reminds me of my grandmother. She passed away a little over a decade ago, but I still remember her vividly and we used to be very close. Back then, we had no relation to this band. But for some reason, this brings all those memories back
SPECIAL ! 🖤
disappointing avenged died with revv
2008: 1st time i listen a7x, until now 2024. 16 years 🥹
Di tunggu ke indonesia
A true spiritual sequel to Exist. 🤘🤘
wtf is this    i wanted power metal
A7x forever
HUGE FAN AWESOME VIDEO AVENGED Sevenfold KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK LOVE THE VIDEO AND LOVE THE CREATION
1:26 i meant
best part the cosmic 1:30 - 3:13
Does A7X do heavy metal anymore like Nightmare?
DON'T FEAR THE REAPER FOR HE WAS ONCE HUMAN
This song causes me something even deeper than "Roman Sky". Can't explain. Is amazing
Am thinking this is the most BEAUTIFUL song ive ever heard. Wish i was 13 just to have it in my life for many years. Grief and Katharsis comes along the way close to the end just like the Ancient Greek Tragedies. Katharsis had to happened
Prime example
Pepsi?
Зачем запрещать видео в России ? В чём причина ?
dunia terasa berubah ketika kehilangan arah tujuan, namun ingin sekali kembali ke tujuan yang jelas dan terarah meskipun susah untuk di lakukan.
Best one in the last 3 albums, tbh
Even if only to me I feel like I relate to the skeleton watching the hour glass of those I love run out as I’m helpless to stop it god damn I miss you so much
I simply love this new sound..looks for the best..btw I will do 1 pushup for each like this comment gets...
I am more like a Thrash Metal guy, but this is amazing.
Rip my beautiful daughter Amber I will dance with you again 💔 😢
MASTERPIECE
Im so fuckin obsessed with this song
bosta.
This exactly how I imagined it! Good job once again boys.
Masterpiece.  This song is beautiful.  Rest in peace to my son. Thank you to the band that introduced me to rock n roll death metal. Hard rock whatvever u call it.  Thanks avenged sevenfold. Been hooked since nightmare album and love the ones before that album too if it wasn't for yall I would have missed out on this music with the drums n guitars.  Love it
Worlds biggest jump scare 5:09
Beautiful videooo
If you’ve taken psychedics then you know that this song and video both delve into ego death and timelessness. Avenged Sevenfold is incredible
This song brought me to tears. I know it will be hard but if you do all the good you can, I know that anyone can be cosmic.
what a beautiful song...
Honestly I’ve never seen such a beautiful music video
Sevenfoldism Jakarta Forever  Est 2012 🤘
Amazing animation 👏👏👏👏👏 coming from a fellow stop motion animator
WOW....😢😮❤
this hits different
The song and the video are beautiful.
❤❤❤
These visuals are beyond beautiful
Sangatlah dalam
Teu jelas Melodi gitar na ciga lagu dangdut😂
@1:25
Beautifull song..???
This album may not be their best, but it's definitely more creative.
Amazing guitar sólo , as always ❤
The REV would be so fucking proud of where you guys are today… he’s smiling from up above “until we meet again” this song is incredible
This song is awesome.. reminding us that we never fade away. There's a new day for us. But our souls are always the same through out it all.  I know you miss your friend and we'll be together again thru all this galaxy.
song this similar a song a little piece of heaven 😇
Holly shaet this is the future
How many times have you watched this? Yes
This song really broke me because my cat recently passed away. Until we meet again.
omg
😈😈
It perfectly spells out the journey of a cocreator as a human but starting at death and what you go through after what is left keeping your spirit alive and how that then becomes what actually defines how you grow after death well in this world view at least I miss the rev. I still feel that ever since I hear fiction I have heard it already in four or five more of their songs. They’re my new favorites but it still hurts. He wrote us plenty of music though there is probably so much we haven’t heard just sketchings but beautiful music if in the hands of like minded individuals. We have family and then we have a whole other spiritual family full of people we would kill in life to be around. Just saying. We as humans have made a mistake to turn so away from everything spiritual we don’t see the benefits as those who are in it do and don’t want to give that up if it cost them their life. Now if ya ask me that’s gotta be some really good stuff they got goin on in their cultural activities if that is what it’s worth. Our ancestors told crazy stories that we don’t believe but they saw things much differently they had sensitivities to their own set to stimuli imagine the world they saw you wouldn’t believe anyway it really is that much different as you jump bag as little as two hundred years at a time things change hard to be them and who you are now you would be a superhero to normal people around you.
I feel him man. Hope he gets a partner in the future, afterlife, or in the next life that will assist him through his journey.
another masterpiece, brought me tears
I play at 9999999 times
3:06 cara isso me emociona
I miss my daughter and it hurts so much I feel like im losing my mind, my thoughts are so crazy and scary
Even this round Avenger Sevenfold didn't miss their aim, this song was a real work of art, the video Is really cool, I think that from the Stage album a life Is but a dream they evolved by adding also progressive Metal genre and they did It well, i have to say they have a true masterpiece, congratulations.
Mantap🎉
Finally ... A7x song must like this..  Welcome😊 to jogjakarta soon..
I miss the harder and faster ax7 every song is some slow ballad bs and I just dislike it. Unholy Confessions is their best song.
This video really touched my soul. Its the most beautiful thing I've ever seen I'm my life, this is my first time as a grown man that a song/video has made me cry. Matt, Bryan, Johnny, Zach, and Brooks I love you. We love you.
good stuff
LEGEND! HAS! COMEBACK!! - sudah beberapa tahun silam, dan A7X kembali lagi. sangat senang untuk terus menikmati karya2 A7X kembali,. So Nostalgic, Thankyou!
Well done guys
Hearing this while hitting a blunt... bro... Avenged Sevenfold will always have a special place in my heart. I really want to meet them and talk to them :( come to Houston already, you have fans here :(
You couldn't have made a more accurate visualisation/clip for this legendary song, i can't believe how the clip itself is the same as the one i had in my mind since the first time i heard it. You guys are way too good to be true... I'm in tears as of writing this, this is... beautiful!...
The Best song for me❤
Omg!
I like Avenged Sevenfold's music. Always healthy, m shadow
Holy Shit! This is fucking amazing!!!!!!
🇸🇩🇸🇩🇸🇩🇸🇩🇸🇩🇸🇩🇸🇩
My 14 yr old is a fan. Took her to the Raleigh show last night and they closed with this masterpiece. It was the first time I have ever heard Cosmic and I've played it at least 20 times since. Beautiful song that conjures up so much emotion. Miss you mom and dad, and I hope when my time comes this song feels like the same gentle hug to her as it does to me.
Its symbolism and everything for this song was beautifully created and well executed!!!
Meh who listens this crap. fkning posers
woooooooow
Ditunggu kedatangannya di jakarta 🤘🏼🤘🏼
so good
Vai se passar anos e anos e essa vou escutar sempre🇧🇷🖤🔥
Not their best…
For Remembering REV , which is the holy week for Christianity . Happy Easter ❤
Respond in 2025 pls
❤❤😢
fucking beautiful
"Cosmic"  Fade From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye  Fate Has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone, I can't wait too long Fade  Love We loved so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right  Pain It found its way back in Until we meet again Into that good night  None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me Before the dawn of man, in castles made of sand There you'll find me Writing in the caves as fire lights the way There you'll find me Mask of royal glow don in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  Let it go Yeah Rings of dust and ice weightless in the night There you'll find me Let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me Before the dawn of man in castles made of sand There you'll find me Writing in the caves as fire lights the way There you'll find me Mask of royal glow don in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try I'm gone We loved so many times And in so many lives I'm gone Sometimes we got it right I'm gone It found it's way back in Until we meet again I'm gone Into that good
Conheci meu ex no tributo do Avenged que rolou dia 29/07/23. Daí meio que essa música ficou registrada quando nos, dei primeiro beijo nele e desde então a gente ficou inseparáveis até o dia que completamos 6 meses, nos separamos e toda vez que eu ouço essa música o refrão dela eu lembro do anel que ele me deu no dia do tributo. Hoje vai haver novamente o tributo só que com banda diferente. Estaríamos completando 8 meses ontem no caso. Eu sinto falta mas não posso sentir falta sozinha 💔
Beautiful 😍🥹
<3
Thank u❤😢
Love it❤❤
Beautiful
The Rev couldn't ascend he was to damaged what an honour to him they gave it all to him what a band my favourite my boys I f love you

la se foi uma banda, Nunca será Boa como antes 💔 sdd do antigo Avenged! 😢
Just watched them at Knoxville last night. What an experience! Loved these guys since City of Evil and they pulled out some classics. My highlight was Roman Sky which i didn't expect to be played. I had tears at the first chorus.
I wish we got a music video with the actual band in it instead of these stop motion style animation on top of windows xp screensavers
This is me
Love this ❤❤
Ninggal jejak!!
Can't do the new stuff or the slow stuff
LOVE U FORM INDONESIA!
Kindai man vuip quertos mard feavo full music
Anyone still here in 2024?
Makin kesini makin mellow 😂
Excellent rock and metal radio station. Google it: "shogun rocks laut"  Have fun...
I havent been vibing with A7x for some time and I really really want to like this one, but it feels like they're trying to be like Muse and im sorry, they dont have it.  This is just my preference. Everyone else who are still enjoying A7x to this day, I envy you coz i miss rock and punk etc
Be strong my brothers and sisters
Nice song❤❤❤🎉🎉
I can't stop listen this song. Is beautiful.
Man this shit trash
I miss old A7X
QUIERO DE LO Q FUMO ESTE TIPO....
Essa musica é uma obra de arte.
This song is such a masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥
They never planned on making cosmic a single, it debuted at area 15 and their producer noticed everyone loving it and they decided it deserved it's own video and to be sung live with part 3 of their LIBAD tour
Until we meet again❤
Very return the slab of you Mr flowy skeleton dude.
And as the hourglass is flipped... another life is born.
Felt like I went on a journey.
This video... brings chills, goosebumps and makes me feel like im not alone afterall. Sorry for all the comments, at least they were all positive:)
❤
Lord protect us 🙏
please bring this song and "almost easy" in Jakarta later ❤
I will play this song in my Birthday. June 2.
Dari umur 8 tahun sampai sekarang masih suka senget music a7x...nostalgia.. Mantap.. Sukses terus semoga mendapat hidayah❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢 salam. Dari indonesia  🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩

The best song of this album LIBAD🔥 This Is Masterpiece🤘🔥😎   Indonesian, 28 March 2024
Just phenominal. Instrumentals are so killer.
I think I truly, actually I know for a fact that I truly understand this grim reaper/skeleton/death/life/NIGHTMARE theme THESE GUYS ARE THE SHIT. CANT EVEN BEGIN TO EXPLAIN OR DESCRIBE THE EXTENT I FEEL THAT.. ITS BEYOND WORDS. ITS JUST EITHER YOU KNOW, OR YOU DONT. PERSONALLY, I LOVE THIS BAND, AS MY LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE REALLY LINED UP❤❤❤❤❤
Amei❤
Santa Muerte
Simply Gorgeous 💀
Nobody is talking about Terry Pratchett 👀👀
No matter what people's reaction to the album (i will openly admit I am personally not a fan of a lot of it), I will say that I believe this is one of, if not the best A7X song.
At last!!!
Finally getting new music thats actually new and good
Yes, I'd like to watch this high. Love this new album A7F, shiz fire
Beautiful track ❤
Mannn.... I really need to do some mushrooms. Love this band! Unholy confessions was the first song I heard and they have been my favorite band since then
The reaper only comes with frightening face with black cloak when the person didn't repent before he dies. But it come with smiling face good looking white cloak for those who did make it. Assalamualaikumwarahmatullah. Love❤❤❤❤❤

Wow, such a beautiful and emotional song. I was tearing up for a moment. Great song.
I have to say this album is such a masterpiece i am so happy with all the changes in the album. And Cosmic is a song that means a lot to me. As i feel connected to the cosmos as we all should. The ride of emotions runs deep in this album and this song is just amazing. Hope when i am gone the song will echo throughout the universe as time slips away.
The break a leg for this song
Aaaaaaaaaa❤
This is some of the best guitar playing I've ever heard.
God damn the symbolism. I freaking love it. Much love and peace to all!!!
masterpiece😚🤌
Very cool and inspiring. Awesome song and video
The first time I heard this it immediately became my favorite song by you guys. It's fucking incredible.
Finallllllyyyyyyy
This is art (thank you for the new profile picture btw)
Love or hate this album, this song is amazing.
Just can't stop watching over and over. Not to be morbid but I'd want my loved one to think of this song(video ending) if my time came.
Awesome

Dance of death 🖤🔥
😭 Beautifully executed 😭

The hints of rev and Chester rip within the main and middle and end of the song beautifully done. 😢
Yoo hohohohooo
The rev sir sent me to tell you all that he still loves u billion times more than u love him and he is still the best drummer in his new world
This stop motion is so good

The old sevenfold was much better. After a year of releasing “the stage”, I stopped listening to them.

Gempak gilerrrrr
My ADHD mode kicked in , replaying video all day today.
It,s great
I am you and you are me, we are all just specs of energy and space dust floating through the cosmics for eternity. This is one of the best songs ever written and produced imo. EVERY FUCKING NOTE AND LYRIC IN THIS SONG ARE PLACED PERFECTLY AND PURPOSEFULLY!
¿Saben? Creo que la vida no es tan mala... Ni morir da tanto miedo

Today is march 25. Crucifixion
A7X is gone
Masterpiece ⚜
Woah, Avenged 7 Floyd
this video fits so well its hard to hear this song without the video now
That skeleton dancing really made me cry
warm greetings from Indonesia
it's new song?? so powerfull matt shadow vocal,,
That's Organ 🔥🔥🔥
I am waiting for you in Indonesia, with our first and last meeting, for 11 years I have been amazed by the music you create, always success for you and greetings from Indonesia, I am I was waiting for you in Indonesia, with our first and last meeting, for 11 years I was amazed by the music you created, success always to you and greetings from Indonesia, I will miss you guys very much
Since it seems everyone is sharing their stories, I will too. I lost my wife of 9 years about a year and a half ago. This whole album has been a wonder in healing me. From the Nobody video when the skeleton finds everything in "heaven" is fake and jumps off the cliff into the universe, which made me so emotional, to this vid that seemed a bit more on the happier side.. cosmic dance of destruction.   Facts is, all of our clocks expire. A7X really tapped into something beyond this world with this album.. cuz after all, Life is truly, But A Dream...
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Cosmic
It's no accident that A7X's best songs are like a long journey...many separate parts, melodies and tempos arranged into a masterpiece.  One of the few bands out there with the balls to stray from the 3.5 minute verse/chorus/verse/hook formula and really risk it all to experiment and play what they feel.  Clearly, it resonates.  While they are truly at their best with the heavy stuff with hooks and payoffs, almost nobody does these epic songs better.  Showcases perfectly why 20 years ago a lot of us knew they'd stay evolving and stay at the top.
Incredible is the most beutiful song that i have heard, the contrast of the lirycs transport the feelings another  level of frecuency, my favorit song ever, Thanks Avenged!
Avenged Sevenfold… that name is gonna live with me foREVer. Easily my favorite band ever
💀✨💕
ALBUM COSMIC
Listen to this when there is a full moon and look at the moon ❤
They finished Nebraska tour with this song. I didn't hear it before so it was a timeless experience.
💓Beautiful composition......................Tranquility

Si Es lo que veía cuando la cantaba y el viento me hacía compañía

Masterpiece bang
Sooooooooooooo happy yall made a video for this song!!!! LIBAD is such an amazing album!!! A7X is the best band in the world!!!!
These latest songs fall pretty close to the legendary pink flyod I swear
melodinya seperti aliran Yngwie Malmsteen
My wife and I might be going through a miscarriage.  It a long story. This song is so dang perfect right now. This is what we need.
Hoping to find her again in the stars after we're both long gone...

Amazing. I can stay for a while.

Wow!! That hit the feels 😢 ❤

I'm terminal and hubby and I will be celebrating 36 years of marriage April  6th. This song along with Promise from megadeath are going to be played at my funeral. Thanks for a beautiful song.
This song😭 I first heard it on my way to my best friends funeral. #fuckcancer
What a masterpiece 🤟🎸🤟🎸🥁🤟🥁🤟🎯!!! Nice piano work too👍!!!
I miss so hard old times videoclips
I always love how they bring out different emotions from their music…goes absolutely insane for sometime and goes into a relaxing vibe again
I'm a fan of a7x but this album sucks
A masterpiece !! I can't stop to shed a tear when I listen this song...
No more Metal song,now become a ballads band😂
I'm 40-ish now and i've heard of Avenged Sevenfold a couple of times before in my life, but i've never actually listened to one of their songs. This is the first one of their songs i listened too. And oh boy, do i have a lot of backlogging to do in the coming months ☺❤
Ollie grant Cody Jason Jimmy Peggy Walter Tyler Joe Dylan pat  father grand mother I will see you again some day I love and miss you all so much thank you for being here for me while you all was
Tanto la canción,como el el video son una obra de arte. Larga vida a A7X
A7x is my life❤
His voice be getting deep. Marinated like jack blacks
Dedico essa música a minha querida Bety, minha doguinha e filha amada que iria fazer 19 anos de idade no próximo mês e se foi semana passada, e hj para meu gatinho Kira que se foi nesse dia e iria fazer 11 anos. Sempre lembrarei de vcs com carinho e amor e saudades, e imaginando que estão felizes e bem, e que quando eu partir encontrarei vcs  assim como todos que se foram antes de nós ❤
Crazzzzzzzyyyyyyy
Me lembro de F-zero X, qd jogava no mesmo Nintendo 64, e essa música me passa muito essa vibe 😢
Song made me cry the first time I listened to it such a masterpiece. I really wish they played it in LA at the Forum😞
Thank you SO much for coming to New Hampshire! (SNHU Arena) Last night was a night I'll remember for the rest of my life. Shoutout to Sullivan King and Poppy who also put on great performances.
Absolutely perfect
Blown away! 🔥🔥🔥 Masterpiece!!!! 👏👏

Good special effects
Wow......😢
That 'Fiction' vibes bringing back the nostalgic memories of 'The Rev' can effortlessly make any A7X  fans shed their tears. Thank you A7X

Seperti wayang orang di Indonesia pada reff nya
I lost my fiancé two weeks ago at a very young age. I don’t like sharing things with people but A7X has always been a part of my life growing up. I shared my love of the band with her and she became a fan. Although life is unfair at times, this song helps me find peace. May we meet again on the other side. I love you bubsy.💕
Menyala abangku 🔥🔥🔥
Acid Rain plagiarized? 😂 awesome song nonetheless 😢😢😢

Oh my yisus christ, is the best music song ever
Somehow this song made me emotional
Crazy that the Stage is already 7 years old. I like this version of avenged
I'm in Grad School for my MA in English: Creative Writing. I say this because when I was a teenager I was suffering from severe undiagnosed depression. i thought maybe it was just some phase that I would look back on and roll my eyes with. Looking back, and how it took me drastically changing my life for me to escape it, there was more going on. So when I first heard this album, it captured all my worries, fears, anxieties, and dread from that time of my life before I swapped to English as my major. Every single song. Game Over, Mattel, Nobody, We Love You, every single one captured an emotion, a thought, a feeling. Except this one. Cosmic feels like the only one that feels like a song in my current stage of life. And while there are many interpretations, this song reminds me of my current girlfriend and I and our backgrounds. How many times where if our lives diverted just slightly, we probably still would have met. We both admitted it felt like an inevitability and somehow God brought us together. So even though this song is about the death of a loved one and meeting again in another life, that's how this relationship feels. Like we'll always meet again somehow. This song makes me tear up more often than not.  Edit 7 months later: 11/04/2024. Turns out she cheated on me a few months before this video and I found out through the guy she cheated on me with. She tried to break it off with him as a fling, but the damage was done. At that time we were 3 years together.  She may feel guilt, but that's on her. Maybe in another time or life we would have worked, but not in this one.
Is back❤  This is avenged sevenfold
What a symphomatic masterpiece!!! Lyrical journeys worth the trip. It made me remember the times when you we had to actually make the journey to the music store or the ticket booth and stand in line, gazing at the art on the covers and thrn then unwrapping the plastic and listening to our new " cosmic" tunes frontward and backwards on repeat !!!  Kinda like that hour ⌛️  he kept flipping over again. Thiz days are gone but I find them i  moments like this. Fist bump with a knuckle kiss and horns!!!!❤👊💋🤘💥💫⌛️
Thankyou A7x
I absolutely love watching this skeleton’s journey through all these videos you guys have put out with him as the main character!!
never liked avenged, huge bfmv fan but could never swallow the "devilish" vibe to a7x, but I appreciate how progressive their songwriting can be, this song is huge in lots of ways
It's almost a year LIBAD dropped. I remember the first-time i listened to cosmic. Such an emotional vibe but it brings a smile. This song brings memories about our loved ones who passed on. That Skeleton dance makes this video special😎 Masterpiece Album
Masterpiece 🇦🇷🤘🏻
Time to watch this again while trippin hard on droogs
Masterpiece
The way this band can reinvent themselves never ceases to amaze me.
My closest friend and the person I cared most about died a little over a year ago. This made me cry hard
Great song! Reminds me of MUSE too.
Boa noite meu consagrado!

Last album, it felt like it was but wasn't the Matt Shadows voice I'd come to love belting out lyrics from wherever M.Shadows belt lyrics. So far this one is the sound I remember falling in love with! Sounds good Matt!
Indonesia fans❤
Masterpiece 🔥🔥
This was awesome. I am not very familiar with this band's material, might have heart one or two songs before. This is definitely in prog rock territory. I thought they were more like an alternative rock/metal act. Do they have other prog-injected tracks like this, or is this just a one-off?
This song rules. 😢
The Best Song 🔥
I can hear Daft Punk in this song
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!!
Wow. Masterpiece
Avenged sevenfold evergreen masterpiece ✨⭐❤
Pqp. Que MÚSICA FODA!!!!! Avenged quando começou a trabalhar essa temática da morte, principalmente com o existencialismo e uma espécie de solidão que a espécie humana sente, acreditando ser a única no universo, entrou em um nicho de gigantes. Hard rock, espiritualidade e ciência juntos!! FODA DEMAIS!
😭 a7x year 2024
Seems like a full journey coming to an end with this one
Foda ❤
I guess they ran out of things to say. ...man I miss the old days..in general.
Dude....Epic 😎 Perfectly Compliments The Music 🎶
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Just masterpiece.
This is fantastic! Very eclectic, experimental and intriguing,  all while staying true to your sound. ❤
Just when i'm at my worst place, they pull of an MV for cosmic. They simply made may day.
I guess the skull with batwings is out.
this song came into my life just in the right moment.
Wunderschön!!! Danke dafür!!! Dieses Meisterwerk wird vielen  helfen durch die harte Trauer zu kommen!!!
Exist walked, so that this whole album (and especially this track) could run
They played this in there Lincoln show last week.  Lost song of the night.  And i hadnt really listened to their new album much.  But damn.  This song has me awe struck.  Almost teared up.  What a masterpiece
Thank you for making this song meaningfull
this track feels like a garage band have recording a demo and then the guitarist trying showoff their skills..
Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good

Enjoying this masterpiece on a rainy day in Beautiful SOCAL!🤘🖖
i think if the music video is like a journey of them (like MV of dear god) it'll be an amazing MV
I would never listen to this song but I feel it has a message for me. This is not enjoyable at all in my ears but I was brought here for a reason.
wooow
Mr gaytes slaying like a boss
Holy....moly.....that music video should be played at school so people appreciate life more.

Best song
You’re crying.
Lost my cousin last year. This was his favorite band. This album has been life changing for me. Man incredible guitar solo. The whole piece is amazing. Keep killing it AX7
Kapan ke Indonesia
Tremendo tripi os tuvisteis que meter para hacer semejante truño

DAMN, AMAZING😭
!@#$ING AWESOME \,,/...
I miss the good old city of evil avenged sevenfold.. new albums aren’t that powerful in my opinion
No offense but the skeleton must be The Rev... 🤘🏻🤘🏻
3/22/2022 I lost my mother, my best friend, to cancer. She faced an incurable glioblastoma valiantly and with grace. I moved to Vegas soon after she passed to be with my then fiancé. Ten months later, June 8, 2023, she collapsed due to cardiac arrest caused by a terminal lung disease no one knew she had. She went home in my arms, just like mother. They’re dancing together on the beaches of Heaven. There, I will find them.   “Lay away a place for me ‘Cause as soon as I’m done  I’ll be on my way To live eternally…”
Menyala abangkuh syn 🔥🔥🔥
Aku tunggu di jakarta,menyala abangku 🔥 🤘
Hebat....👍🏻
Goddamn.  That was incredible. Shit brought tears to my eyes.
What a guitar solo. Just so beautiful and that is one reasons i keep coming back i keep coming back to a7x.
masterpiece, combination vibes
IMO, this and The Stage are their two best songs since the Nightmare album. Cosmic even sounds like the epilogue to The Stage.
Oofta lol this is not great
Amazing song and video! Really Cosmic, really emotional. It's perfect.
Instant classsic in my books, thank you a7x
I'm blown away. This music video is an absolute masterpiece. My initial reaction was this is the ALPOH of LIBAD. It definitely got me in the feels.
This video is amazing. It honestly fits w/ the song. What I get from this is that Death is traveling throughout the cosmos for a millennia in search for inner peace & tranquility.
I’m not crying your crying 😢
What a kick a55 solo, it takes the song to a new high and brings it back again.
Oof this band aged really fast
Simplemente arte 🖤💀🤘
It's a fucking masterpiece.
Worst album in avenged history but got experiment
I see someone has watched the ending of The Fountain… good stuff!
This video is legendary
💖💫💖💫💖💫💖💫💖💫💖💫💖
The tempo change is legendary ❤
The drummer killed it, awesome drumming.
At tou next concert you should give people cowbells to randomly hit hit throughout the concert
What an amazing song and musicality! Deeply impressed guys! Was always a fan of yours.
legend
Solo somos polvos de estrellas en la inmensidad del universo😊
Please add this into the set y’all killed it in Denver but this monster was missed love y’all ❤

Mais uma música incrível dessa banda
Gracias por tanto A7X
Entah knpa hanya musik a7x di jaman the rev yg masuk d telinga gw yg skrg" jiwa ny seakan hilang 😢
this is one of the many songs that bring me the most relaxation, but i can tell you out of all the relaxing songs ive got in a playlist, this one brings me the most peace. and the visuals and everything in this music video just capture my feelings perfectly. the director really knew what they were doing here.
Lyrics…!  Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
Mantapp sekalii    🇮🇩
guys my Javascript is disabled in browser. Is this Opeth playing?
I have to say, seeing them perform this song live in concert last night was absolutely epic.
Quel talent ! très belle chanson !
Masterpiece!
I shared this video on whatsaapp and My dad asked me if I was drugged😂😂😂😂😂😂
Skeleton
Their new stuff isn't as good as their older albums.
Toda la canción esta genial hasta el minuto 5:30 ya después en lo personal no me gusto mucho el resto
Mmmmmm, brand new pop radio band😂 Can't belive that this band made absolute masterpiece like "The Stage" 👎👎👎👎
❤
Many people dont realize what kind of musical masterpiece this album is first time listening i didn't get it. This is overall their best album if you think about storytelling and musical structures of the songs if you think about the problems of the world thats been going on for a while now this is the kind of music we people need right now 70s rock vibes are strong in this album also i like the classical parts one of the greatest album done for awhile metallicas new album cant even get close to this life is but a dream is good song to end this album amazing job these guys are musical geniuses rev would be proud of you.
menyalaaa abanggkuhhhhhh🔥🔥🔥
i love this music i love your all song Avenged ❤ from Indonesian
I was disappointed that they didn't play this song when my son and I saw them last summer but really glad they've incorporated it now. This entire album is so well constructed and this song in particular is perfectly placed within its context. And, this song!! My God, how it has resonated with people! It is truly transcendent and achingly beautiful. I'm a relative new comer to this group (thanks to my son) but I'm a fan now!
Kinda reminds me of the knife master
Best song from this millennium so far
love it
This masterpiece song is so amazing ❤
Tuhan bersama kita dimanapun berada mau sejauh apapun cosmos berkembang
A primeira que amamos no álbum. Emocionante
💜🥹🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
What is a Skeletons favorite snack? Go on...... Guess. LOL!
This song takes the fear out of death and helps me remember to let things go and live happy ❤
So... Did Death go on a vacation? LOL!
This song makes my spirit dance EVERYTIME I listen to it and seeing the video also makes me cry happy tears. I've never had a song bring this much emotion of love, happiness and just completely freeing, it's absolutely crazy ❤💃
Death is finally free

This is sooooooo amazingpy made❤❤ A7X is back with a big bang
This made me cry.
Wonderful AI clip
This is such a well written, recorded and produced song that it didn't even need a video to go with it.  The video is just a bonus. Thank you, Avenged Sevenfold.
❤❤❤❤
Why do they no longer make music videos with the actual band members in it? 😢
Cosmic is a masterpiece 🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭
Thank you for making such a long trip to my land. I'd love to hear cosmic there. One of my dreams will come true on June 30 in Lisbon, Portugal.....thank you thank you thank you
Sanur Denpasar Bali hadir 22 Maret 2024 🔥🔥🔥
Currently playing through FF7 Rebirth and this song hits hard. 😅 Are you fans by any chance? 🤣
The cosmos is all we have and all we are. Anyone who listens to a7x and denies being spiritual is 100%lying!  Their songs are esoteric  and other worldly.  Thanks for great music and thanks to the great guy who introduced me to them ❤ you might have abandoned me when i needed you but these guys have got me through some fuxking tough times.
Portland Oregon!!!!! Please!!

I would love to be a skeleton on a boat drifting through the cosmos for eternity
Es escuchar ésta canción y terminar llorando por la emocion que inspira, si no te emocionas con éste tema entonces es urgente que te encuentres a ti mismo
Thank you Avenged Sevenfold for this album. You've been part of my life since i was a kid. This album just got me reconnected to you and i am 100% sure that the long wait was worth it. Love from 🇮🇳
The new album is ready to be performed in Jakarta ❤️‍🔥🎉

This is up there as one of the best songs. It's got every ingredient. Musicianship, Lyrics, emotional weight, pathos, a whole story in different parts. Thanks for releasing this music video.
pinche rola, me eriza los pelos del culo y del culo del alma

Man, this makes me feel uncomfortable...in a good way.
Apakah lagu ini akan dibawakan di Indonesia Mendatang?
Melhor banda de todas  I love you avenged
The Fact that the skeleton is “Rev” dancing in the afterlife. 🥹
When the skeleton stands on the horizon facing the sun, it creates an “eye” in the sky, just like in the Nobody video.
Simplesmente perfeita essa canção e o clipe, A7X ❤️ obrigada 🥹
Amigos, díganme quién más pensó en Zelda Majora’s Mask al ver los movimientos del personaje bailar cuando Matt canta “Dancing in the wind…” junto con el movimiento que hace en el minuto 4:18? Por alguna razón fue lo primero que se vino a mi mente al ver esta parte 👀  El video es simplemente hermoso ❤
I hope all members in your band convert to islam the truth
Oke bang, lagu em rodok masuk iki
A7X u have big fans in indonesia
⏳💀🤘🏾🖤
The new album is the best 💀🤘🏾
Its so good
God Bless A7X. Love you guys. RIP Rev!

Ditunggu di jakarta may 2024🎉 Jejak orang Indo kumpul sini
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻Rayos chicos...
ОЧЕНЬ ХОРОШО
I really wish I could like this album, but I just can't. I understand bands change their sound over time, but its almost like they completely switched genres. Been a fan since 2005 and im going to see them for the 2nd time March 29th. But I honestly can't say that I like a single song on LIBAD.
Matt Shadows' voice is a so fckng Magnificent!!❤
YOUR NOT ALONE ❤
Another great video for another amazing song. This one really speaks to me, they are definitely taking the same drugs I'm taking.
La buena música está de vuelta y eso es genial!!
No way people like this song this much. It's confused, like the whole album and matt sounds weak. It's not a bad song, but it has the same randomness as the other songs on the album, the odd times signatures don't sound smooth, it seems like one day they woke up and be "let's go progressive", but I still haven't heard any smooth transition on this album
Man all I wanna do is eat some mushrooms and watch this video now 🤯
What happened to this band?
This song is a perfect example of how a more progressive song writing does not hinder any quality whatsoever.
A7X got pink floyded ❤️
Im not gonna lie.... dancing was the LAST thing i thought that skeleton was gonna do in that sunset 😂
I love their music but I missed the old A7X. Who else?
Until we meet again :)
I don't know why but it reminds me of avatar the last air bender.
Meu Deus, só eu que lembrei das musicas antigas, esse solo não tem como não reconhecer, muito foda!
I still love you A7X, even after thoses years, you keep awesome. thx alot.
I suggest anyone really into this song check out Devin Townsend. Specifically albums Ziltoid the Omniscient and Empath.
Awesome song !!!🤘
How not to love these guys? A7X for life 🤘🏼
singgah dulu masseh❤

This clip is very good🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼😜🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😂😂😂😦😦
I've never had a song affect me the way this one has upon multiple listens. It's spiritual to me. The more you listen the more it rips your heart out in the most beautiful way. I've tried explaining this song to people and you can't. It's an experience, the best song they've written. 'Until we meet again (l'm GONE)... Into that good’...🌌🚀🚀
Welcome back guys
My brother commited suicide a few years ago. He loved a different genre of music, but when I showed him a few Metal songs, he fell in love with “So Far Away”. I wish he could have heard this one. RIP David
man, I love this song, but the weird piano cut at 3:28 keeps me up at night 😆 anyways, what a beautiful song n video 🤍🤍🤍
This music video is 100% A.I. generated 👌🏻☑️😍
pretty good
FC from Laos 🇱🇦
Hermosa obra maestra
Who’s the artist? The “drawing” artist… and obvious musician artist.  I honestly didn’t know the band but absolutely love the two Welcome skateboards I have and the Collab with this band they did. The graphics and black and gold are the tits! 👌🏻 The shape is welcome but I’d never had noticed my new favorite decks if not for those graphics. So bravo to the artist. 👏🏻 Musically not my thing but as a musician I know obvious talent and proficient ability in one’s craft when I hear it, whether it’s my taste or not… you got it.  Actually..  3/4 through the song, when it slows, is sick.   Musically, it Reminds me a of Muse…. Who reminded me of Radiohead… 🤷🏻‍♂️ All 3 have their unique twist.  All 3 legendary
Strong song Avenged Sevenfold.
Woooooow!!!
Legends
I cannot even begin to describe the amount of emotions I feel listening and watching this Skeleton dance, and then just be, with open arms.  I have always felt the symbolism of this entire album and am so grateful to experience it❤
The guitar solo is beautiful. Been rocking to A7X since a kid, love your music!
Love love love the song the video the émotions. Thanks again for your music
That fade of the solo guitar into the piano. Just wow!!
Gotta say you guys missed me with this one. Just not as much emotion as the last albums.
So beautiful!!
WHY COULDNT JIMMY BE HERE FOR THIS 😭😭 foREVer
Viejos Amigos  de mi juventud a7x
Incredible artistry, this is music.
The Revs gone home with the collective! 🖤
Did they put the lyrics to SORA and got this video??
Actually amazing visualiser, really cool that A7X decided to make a video for this
The drumming in this song is incredible.
Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
Aku harap aku beruntung bertemu orang benar tulus ❤️
Kosmos
Fenomenal!!!
this sounds perfect <3
Ｍａｎｔａｐ❤❤❤
A Masterpiece...
Make me remember my friends not around this world anymore,.
I think this is last album from a7x 😢
Tooo bad i have to work today. otherwise id be at the NJ show. smfh
I miss the "Bat Country" days😢
good song for the month of Ramadan 🤘
This is MUSIC - Scorcese
If my friend was still alive today  i bet this would have been one of his favorites.
Same ol same songs
This style make me remember to the zombies song
i love u
Great, I like it so much, lyrics, voice, video, perfect ❤
The music feels like Pink Floyd ❤
Thanks a lot for this beautiful song 🥹🌹
To be honest, I don't like that vibe. I miss the energy of songs like the first albums.
Menyalalah the rev
Wat ze deden, werkt echt in dit nummer.
Cosmic senses are spiritually instrumented.
Rip The Rev 😢😢
Man, this has such intense Terry Pratchett vibes.
It's a beautiful music video, one of the most stunning to look at of all of them, full of meanings and emotions, but I feel somewhat put off that there isn't very much Avenged Sevenfold of it. As with the Nobody music video, there's skeletal imagery, which is in-character enough for A7X, though not a Deathbat, or anything which indicates that it's an A7X music video specifically. The Nobody music video works extremely well to portray that song because it isn't like any other music video, it has details of Life Is but a Dream...  's themes, and it's so rich of what it elaborates on. I'm not convinced that this music video portrays A7X's music, so much as Chris Hopewell's perspectives of death and existence within his lens of this song as he considers his presentation and not A7X's. Wes Lang has at least painted Deathbats and logos for the band, Mattel's music video by Zoe Katz has clear humor of A7X, and hidden references, so other artists convey abstractions of Life Is but a Dream...  without diminishing A7X's presence of it, but this music video feels adjacent of A7X. Including bat wings on the Grim Reaper could've made it immediately apparent that it's A7X related. As it is, a great number of other songs could be played over it and it would match them equally, because it's common. It isn't distinctly A7X, distinctly Cosmic as a song, or distinctly iconic. I appreciate efforts which had went into it, though for me, it isn't a music video which I'll watch much, any more than a visualizer. I'm grateful to have followed its premiere, and I look forward to every present moment of A7X.
THIS MAKES ME MISS THE REV 💔😭   🙏🏻 REST IN PARADISE JAMES OWEN SULLIVAN🕊  🦇🖤FOREVER IN OUR HEARTS🖤🦇
One of the song on LIBAD that blows me up
Hmmmmm.....no!
I have boundless respect for A7X. They have a vision and stick to it. Thoroughly brilliant. <3
Song sucks
wow..........

Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade  Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good..

Love this. "Dream Theatre" 😉
This brought a smile to my face. I feel so happy to have followed A7X"s journey all this time
that hits insanely hard. Such a bad ass video
Let's go!!!! I hope yall come back to Portland Oregon. That show in October was amazing!!! And we never got this song live, just a tease
Stop making music, stop embarrassing yal self
I love a7x.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
New A7X style I still in old vibe of their music. This is their grown-up song.
New Japanese female vocal metal band!!!!!! https://youtu.be/yuW_JAGjyMM?si=pRloPX10nNrYXmBi
They must be high on the pots when they wrote this. 😂
Can't believe its been a year since life is but a dream came out, time really is going fast 😢
stopped taking DMT ; )
Thank you!!!!🙏
Gonna catch some hate I know, but the song is....interesting. Its not bad by any metric, but I cant say its good either. Style seems to switch too much which breaks my immersion into what the song is trying to portray. Too much tweaking of the vocals. Honestly, its the video that does the song more justice than the song itself. Song just seems all over the place with a couple meaningful parts just thrown in. Maybe its me comparing it to So Far Away, which was perhaps one of the best songs ever written ever, but I still think its been overly messed with in editing that takes away from the meaning itself
I love that this song feels like it takes you through a journey of lifetimes. It's great! Ot feels inspiring for story ideas and such! My favorite off the album.
I want to mimic the others “the skeleton” comments and add that I couldn’t help but think he is the embodiment of R.I.P THE REV and that he not only some how was the inspiration and (this one is a bit far out there but) wrote these before his passing with instructions that only when you are ready and understood something”¿” that then you will be ready to go forward with your work and journey in life. Or it could just be that I’m 🔥🔥💨💨💨💨
I can't be the only one who gets Terry Pratchett "DEATH" vibes from this
OH DIOS MIO, QUE BENDICIÓN
Legend ❤❤❤
Great ☝🏻
A7X are becoming Queen! No negativity in my statement. 😎🤘🇨🇦🤘
This songs really deserved a official video, thanks
Lead vocals sucks. Sorry
This music video brought me memories of Pratchett's books
@Alan_Meekel I will forever be yours my love.
I feel like this video helps me understand the song better... In the most psychadelic of ways 😉
I'm not the same person that I was before listening to this song 🥲

Beautiful video. This album is a masterpiece gentleman. I have listened to it obsessively since it's release. The more I listen the more it speaks to me. A true work of art and thank you to all of the A7X family that brought this masterpiece to the public. Peace love and Rock and Roll to everyone one who hears this beautiful album.
Música lindaaaaa!
The reaper flipping the hourglass like I've been repeating this song
🤘 greeting from malaysia .. do tour here please idol
If there was 2 words I could describe this band it would be: Consistently Masterful!
My mom's dying of cancer as we speak . Only a few days remain before her mortal body fails. This song came to me and brings me peace with what's about to come....she will be dancing in the cosmos free from pain! Speeding through the stars as she returns to dust. Giving off light to those who she impacted. We had a love hate relationship but now that time is no longer none of the bad matters. She lived a beautiful life adopted two sons whom she did her best to guide in the right direction. Cheers mom. may you shine forever
This video is almost a masterpiece just like the song 🙌🏼
What in the blue fuck was that? Theyre getting WAY out there
This feels like Exist 2
This song is amazing!! An elegant,beautiful masterpiece!
You did what you set out to do Mat. This IS bold. Thank you for sharing your gifts and talents over the years.
Musical, listenable and still totally melts faces... Thanks for all the years of amazing guitar work Brian.
👍
love this song so much. such a reminder of mortality. makes me think of my son and how much i want to live for him.
Just Another Day.
This music video perfectly captivates my emotions and thoughts when I listen to Cosmic. Such a beautiful piece, and a fantastic vid to go with it! 🤘🤘🤘
This is probably their best
man, never thought I'd cry this hard watching this. they really made me feel like I was wandering through my life
WELL...MIND BLOWN❤
go back to pre nightmare!!!
this song kicks ass
This hit me like a ton of fucking bricks ! THANK YOU A7X !!
This song gives the motivation to appreciate more the times I spend with my love ones... every time I listen to Cosmic, it reminds me that there's going to be a "time's up" for our love ones and us... nothing lasts for ever and times is gold guys. Spend time with your families because those times ain't coming back, love you all❤
Bellisimo
Bof, pourquoi c'est pas le vrai groupe qui joue ?
Belíssima, essa é uma das melhores do Life is but a dream, tava merecendo um video mesmo
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhh
This album is better than anything Avenged Sevenfold has ever recorded.
the tapping and crescendo being exactly how i felt the first time hearing this feels so good
wat
anime opening be like
😍😍😍
There’s Rachmaninov concerto #3, then this song. Maybe not even in that order this song is a masterpiece. Glad to know I’m not the only who get emotional almost every time hearing this song and as always the boys make the best vids to go w their works
Abang Sevenfold seni memang sampai ke dalam lubuk jiwa,tahniah,telah buat manusia sedar
A masterpiece, lemme be a part of this history. Love you all
this song is a godamn masterpiece. ive liked everything from avenged since the very beginning, Alot of people dislike this album but i believe this album shows how much theyve grown in producing music but still sounding like themselves, matts vocals and syn on the guitar are unamcted. this song brings so much thought and emotion with it. truly 1000/10
MENYALA ABANGKU🔥🔥🔥
Best song of the album!!
I'm worthless. I deserved being lied to and manipulated. I deserve prison. My very first sacrifice in life.
Amazing tune.
Everytime I hear this song it triggers my craving to be an outlying observer of the universe. I'll dream of it till I die and even after
Been watching this over and over. The visuals of them dancing is just perfect.
I'm getting ready for a major life change with separation/ divorce. It was amazing to see all of these colors and the dancing of the skeleton on the beach. It reminded me that this is only temporary, and when he flipped it over at the end, it represented that I will start again.
This music video is SO thoughtful it’s crazy
So A7X is a prog rock band now, eh?
this band has grown so much. very good stuff
This is such a gorgeous visual representation of this song. Absolutely brought me to tears, but this song does all the time. Thank you guys for creating this. Just beautiful storytelling.
such a fantastic album 🥰🎶🤟
When did this song come out
I can't get enough of this video. Can't wait to watch this on mushrooms lol
As someone who isn't tied to a theory of the afterlife, this is exactly how I hold onto my loved ones. I dont know what has happened to them, or what will happen to me, but I don't doubt for a second that somehow their energy and memory lives in those unspoken moments of peace that are intimate to me and me alone. This is the most beautiful song I've ever heard.
This song sounds amazing live I was at the concert at van andel arena and I was blown away by this song and the whole show in general lol I almost blacked out in the middle of nightmare but I was standing strong and made sure I finished the show
Antidepressants medicine for betrayal story
This song makes me miss the Rev
This feels like what some would describe as your last moments on earth, an infinite time experienced in an instant, your departure from this planet - a complete look in to everything.
Menyala Abangku🔥🔥🔥
One of my favorites
🥹💀🖤🤎🖤🤎love this video!!!!!!!!!
AT LAST, SIR TERRY, WE MUST WALK TOGETHER.
Good song
If I got to hear Cosmic live, I’m pretty sure I’d ugly cry lol. First time I heard the album Cosmic crushed me emotionally. Same with Syn’s sonata at the end, that piano piece is the cherry on top. I know a lot of people disliked this album, but it connected with me so much. Excellent work guys 🥲
I feel like this song and video completely encapsulate the sound and type of band A7X wants to be right now...and it's so perfect.
This song is so peaceful then the next song is anxiety inducing. they are the perfect duo
Saludos desde Colombia 👏👏👏👏TKS excelente música.💯💯💯
шо за песня,шо за кайф весь вечер на повторе 👽
A very happy song
1 kata "AMAZING" 🔥🔥
Stunning work , wow.
nostalgia pura gracias avenger sevenfold👍👍👍👍
Not nice album
Just woooooooooooooww 😮❤
Imo this band died with The Rev but hey the fans like it and I appreciate that they continue to not let rock music die.
The melody of sadness and happiness become one in harmony.. always touch in different way..
🤢
I have lost count of how many times I have seen this music video since it's release. Best A7X song ever. I mean it.
🔥🔥🔥
There you find me❤
Great visualization of the song. Matches the vibes to a T
That’s me
💯♥️ WONDERFUL 💪🏻🔥✨
WTF!! 😱  🤔😶
Meu amigo, os caras não lançam uma música ruim. 😩😩
<3
Is every comment going to be a fucking sob story 🙄
we always remembered and miss u in our HEART THE REV....
i knew it!!! hahaha
😮🎉🎉🎉🎉
Another music video with Death? I wish bands would get a little more creative. Didn't hold my interest, was hoping it would at least tell a good story. I waited and then nothing happens and it's suddenly over. 😮 please, get over the use of the skelleton/death guys! Move on to better imagery.
Ive never heard this until now. Been a long while since a songs hit me like this one. Great job A7X
ty for coming to portland
Ouch! That was lazy and unimaginative. It's too bad, I was hoping that the video would have elevated the song. Worked for Nobody but this was cheap. 😪
Hats off, Brooks. Again ❤
Jimmy,in every avenged sevenfold fans heart,You never passed away.  Your spirit is in the deathbat to watch over and protect us & the rest of the band,We’ll remember you ForREVer,And never forget!
It’s weird how this album works! Was not a fan at all when it first was released. 24 years of avenged did not prepare me for this album… It’s funny how, after continual listening, it grows on you, quite a bit! Especially this song! Bravo on the video and song!!!
I'm not saying it's bad, but 12 years ago was a lot better then the new stuff
I was already emotional watching this as i just love this song and album, and the video is amazing… but seeing how many people have such a connection with this song made me nearly weep😅
Ever since I first heard this song, I always thought it was a song about death and the acceptance of it. After all nothing can last forever and some day the cosmos shall be ours to venture through if there really is an afterlife. And one day a friend had told me the meaning of the song was, two lovers who will find each other in the life beyond our mortal struggle. Beyond the frames of our view of the universe. No matter where, no matter when, no matter how. These two lovers will always find each other. That message is quite beautiful. At the end of the day, I dunno for sure what this songs about but it always makes me cry listening to it. This is a masterpiece by this amazing band.
Been a fan since Black Ops 2 and love every song except Streets, Wicked End, and Sunny Disposition 😂 This is probably one of the best songs ever made
These are my favourite band but I feel they have really "fell off" with all their new music...
Ficou muito foda, canta demais!
Melhor faixa do álbum 🖤🔥
This is i am all As i am none
Meus amores ❤️
One of their best songs without a doubt. And this vídeo is everything i imagined listening to the song. Really awesome work. Thank you for this masterpiece 🖤
I’m very ill, and may not make it. My 8 year old is scared about my mortality. But he calls Cosmic “our song”. It’s beautiful, sad, uplifting, depressing, all at once. This song; Fucks. Me. Up.  Thank you, Avenged Sevenfold.
i dunno who mixed this song, but they need to be fired. this song sounds awful, but the individual pieces all sound fantastic - whoever put it together, put it together wrong.
I still have my spouse, my kid and my three dogs; yet I have promised my self to look for them and be reunited after all this, all of our lives have passed.  I promise
This song fr nice
Exactly how i imagined this song, omg😭❤️
hello i am from Indonesian
I’d kill to hear this live !
Both of our whole bodies are tingling!
Stay weird, A7X.

Lyrics: Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good

Wednesday, 20 MARCH 2024  from INDONESIA 🇮🇩
love this song :)
the visual aid the music so, so well. when the skeleton dances on the beach it felt like they were using all their time to just enjoy the world and the moment, all while embracing the fact that life will come to an end and I just wanted felt so at peace and moved (I'm probably over the-curtain-is-not-just-blue this, but the hourglasses in the beginning that indicates the losing time just parallel to all the sands on the beach yk). also I like how we as the audience pass through the skeleton's d**k multiple times when light exploded.
1:27 - 3:05 My fav part of the whole album right here. Tiny bit disappointed as here I was expecting more psychedelic visual effects with each reverb (ala MCU Dr Strange). Nevertheless, hearing A7X branching to prog metal is pretty cool
im not even kidding when i tell y’all when they played this song at the buffalo show 3/6 i cried. thank you so much A7X ❤️
Man, Exist and Cosmic are perfect, i love astronomy... so many question in that infinite sea call space. This song and exist are the perfect travel through it! ❤❤
finally a video was made for this song... the most emotional and majestic song on this album... What's more, what I really like is the touch of the Synyster Gates melody which makes it even cooler..... #menyalaabangku🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 See you in jakarta #a7x
This is like the most beautiful thing I've ever watched 😭😭😭
Masterpiece of the album? hit this >>>
Missed those time when music videos showed the band themselves..
Disappointment
❤❤
Epic
Phenomenal.

I dont really like with Nobody and Mattel but Cosmic is a different thing, love it ❤
AVENGED SEVENFOLD - COSMIC  Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade  Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
Didn't enjoy the song as a whole, maybe it will take more listens for me to get into it but so far I only like a few parts in it
One of the MOST beautiful, emotional songs i have ever heard. I havent been an Avenged Sevenfold fan or at least even a listener, until this album came. It was like BOOM. And this song , i kept playing over and over again. LET IT GOOOOOO
is that a new song😍
Imagine this in VR
I hope people understand when you give a band a lot of hate because they want to experiment. Literally preventing them giving you masterpieces like COSMIC! Bands have every right to Experiment to decide what works and what doesn’t work, but when they create a song like this, that has all the right ingredients in it, you won’t be complaining anymore. 😇
Bagaimn bisa❤
the length, it's my calling, I must MAP
Menyala abangku
who's still watching in 2046
This music video resembles so much of Terry Prattchet's Death in Discworld, love it
The Rev, we miss u still ❤
Minute 6:21 beautyfull nod to the best album ever
gw harap bawain lagu ini tgl 25 mei
gw harap bawain lagu ini saat tour ke Indonesia
Yeah, great music, experimental. But i would also appreciate some down to earth themes in songs and videos. Cosmic skelettons we are familiar with since the last record, would like to see YOU guys in video again. Would like to hear and see something like the stage (the song) again, that's what touches me the most. History of humanity, past - present - future. And - oh man - i will always remember how you announced the stage lp on top of that building! Please, stay with us on planet earth. 🫶🏻
so sad how they gave up being one the biggest bands that have ever existed. But yeah. this song is the only good highlight of this album
I absolutely am digging the vibes of this one!!! A7X will always be my favorite band.

the roto toms are just perfect
Weird MV but i love this song
COME TO BRAZIL 💚💛💙🤍
🤣
I really like this music video, but i definitely feel like it wouldve been better if they showed more of the "love story" through the video. The song is about seeing your loved one again throughout all of your lives through time. The concept of this exact video, except with 2 skeletons dancing together, would have been perfect
Although I'm still struggling with this album , it is helping with depression and the feeling of loneliness. This song is so free.
One of the greatest songs of all time, glad to see it got a video.
We waiting in indonesia😊
Ngeriiiiiiiii
This song is 2 min to long
Meh
Dancing in the wind, as roses born again. Then you find God, who create this world, create this feeling, this heart, and this breath.
Man i fucking love this song especially the solo part and the dancing skeleton
wtf is this?
I loved the video and the song is amazing, one of my favorites from the new album. Please, come to Brazil with Life is but a dream tour!!🖤🖤🖤
The album’s a fucking masterpiece
Just beautiful❤
This is sick
Intro nya mirip lagu mel shandy 🤘🏻
4:20 me when I hit that fake Lego fortnite cart
Perfect. Very fitting for the song. This was my mom's favorite Avenged song. We played it at her funeral.
No words….❤ thanks Avenged Sevenfold
Oh man, song was what I was listening to when I got the call my 16yr old doggo was ready to cross the rainbow bridge.. Played the album the whole way back to the vet.. He hung on long enough for me to say goodbye..  M's vocals "there you'll find me"  Damn it, that hits me right in the heart..
Love this fucking band, love this fucking song and love this fucking video <3
Can't wait to see this song live. There will be a sea of tears!!
I get a pink floyd vibe
Thaks guys ❤ 🥲
The best song ever by A7X and now the best video, this is just beautiful. I thought I wouldn't cry again with this song after 8 times, but now I'M GONE one more time hahaha ❤🇧🇷
Finally 🤘
Magnificent, majestic, marvelous. Such an incredible song.  Can’t wait to see it live in the Flesh!
Lyrics please
I understood nothing and everything at the same time. Simply magical
FANS DR INDONESIA🇮🇩  NGUMPUL SINI NGAB
Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade  Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
Pertama denger lagu ini, serasa susah diterima ditelinga, tapi lama lama kok jadi bagus, enak didenger. Pejamkan mataa di sunyi merenung sendiri, mengenang masa lalu yang tidak akan pernah bisa diputar ulang ❤
God, this album is a masterpiece, just the music, and the stories told it's absolutely amazing this album will age like fine wine like the Stage album and as fans get older they'll realize this is the best work they've put out I'm so amazed by everything they've done with this album and I look forward to many more with them
A Rev utáni anyagok valahogy értékelhetetlenek! RIP Rev :(

05:10 This is exactly what I picture in my head when hearing this song (except for the zoom on skeleton wiener)
Absolutely love the piece. Even my 3yr old daughter loves it. Practically on constant replay. Thank you for another masterpiece!
Astral Projection Skeleton 🤣🤣
Holy shit!!!! Why does this video exactly depict my dream, levitating through galaxies and stars.
Amazing imagery and production, never disappointing!

Dude y'all I swear every song is pitch perfect and the sounds are perfect also why do y'all make me wanna rock out constantly I swear y'alls music is the reason i wake up just so i can listen to a7x
Amazing, bravo 👏🏻
Love from Bangladesh ❤️
This song reminds me so much of my dead friend, Hans. Seeing this video makes me happy somehow. He could be the skeleton dancing at the sunset
WELCOME HOME, KINGS OF METAL!!
Holy smokes. This one brought some damn ninjas cuttings onions in my my room.
i knew this song from someone few months ago, such a great song and beautiful video.
Miss you, guys. I'm waiting for the concert in Indonesia🇮🇩
Damn they suck now
All time favourite band.❤ Huge fan of M.Shadows🤘🏻
amazing🎉❤
That's exactly the Dance of Rumi. Djalalluddin Rumi.
The guy who made dr strange version matches with this one ❤❤
Admittedly, i am one of those 'crying is weak' kinda guys. But got damn. What a hypocrite I am. Ive never struggled so much to keep them in. I cant get enough of this song. The drumming toward the end. MShadows deep 'let it go' and the 'im gone' just chills. The 'until we meet again,' just hits it on the head. Thats what i like to believe life is. Never ending. It will always continue. You will see them again. Just in another form/world unknown.
currently my favourite song from the album, always give chills, damn this song is masterpiece.
Avenged Sevenfold - Cosmic  This is the First Video Clip & the First Time Seeing a Skull Can Dance Like an Idol.  Moreover, this is a Reaper, right!  Just from the video clip, it really amazes me.  Where There Is A World Of Space & Lots Of All Stars Too.  Just like Cosmic!
Best song in this album
love it
A7X

❤ thank you for this. Its helping me heal
This is what the inside of my brain looked like when listened to it for the 1st time in June.. like euphoria and melancholy and time travel... fuckin nuts
This song has been a support to my mental health whenever i am alone.
สำเนียงกีต้าโซโล่ สุดยอดทุกเพลง
In Perpetuity Throughout The Universe ⚔️⚔️❤️❤️❤️
The rev would be so proud
This song makes me emotional every time I listen to it.
PLEASE GOD I HOPE THE VIDEO ISN'T AI MADE PLEASE DON'T BE AI MADE *PLEASE DON'T BE AI MADE!!!*
I cant get over how incredible Brooks drumming is in this album, everything fits so incredibly perfectly and I couldn't think of a better track for any song. You guys have really made a good choice. I hope I can hear more albums similar to this even though A7X never makes 2 albums alike.  WE FUCKING LOVE YOU!!!! Please come to Australia ASAP!
I love a7x and this song is great… but for the next album, can we get back to earth? Still a lot of stuff to deal with here.
Man, nice to know I'm not the only one that gets emotional to this song. The end really hits me and makes me wanna cry. Chill everytime I listen it
Menyala abangku 🔥🔥🔥
You can’t  help but tear up when you hear this song..I think about everyone and every pet I ever lost…they’re all up there together, just waiting for me….the video went above and beyond I could have even imagined..imagine this happening to us when we go????? Sign me up! Awesome job boys…
Love this! Reminds me of RA and "The Law of One" teachings 🩵☯️🙏🌅
My tears start to roll down when that sunset scene come up. Its so fking beautiful 🖤 Truly an experience this album was🖤🖤
This is shit
❤😢😅 I have never felt so alive and not alone in my life watching this and listening to it. The building to the apex...  absolutely beautiful I could feel it coming.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I knew soon as I heard this song of the album it was definitely my favourite ❤ it's so beautiful and sad at the same time, just makes me emotional 😭
That is the most beautiful clip to my favourite song you guys. I love you all!
incredible.
An emotional skeleton lmao
My beloved cat passed away three months ago and is still as painful as the day that happened. There is no way I can listen to this in public without losing to my emotions....
melody syn gates like music "Dangdut"  from indonesia
i was looking for old slipknot songs but this is a nice surprise!
Meski tk ngerti artinyo, aku mencoba menikmati moseknyo😭
Will this be the name of the third child from a family with 2 children named Rose and Avenged Sevenfold - Cosmic (Official Visualizer)?
Indo hadir yg indo jg mna coba pngen tau
El mejor album de la banda sin duda alguna.
that was awesome!
Cosmic and Exist are two of the greatest songs they’ve ever created
Simplesmente....  Mágico 😍 Obrigadoo Por Isso 'Evangelho' Sevenfold 🗯️
Lot of sad comments here. Nothing emotional to relate this song to, I just think it’s a super neat piece of music. Incredibly well written! “Into that good night” will always give me chills.
absolutely amazing i cant wait to see you guys again in NH this saturday.
This video is beautifully done. The sunset, the dancing spirit free, flying through time and dancing, so emotional and creative. You guys are all phenomenal artists!
Great song
I miss music videos in which the band appears
MENYALA ABANGKUH🔥🔥
Thanks for all, A7X! Still my favourite band lml
woah, the best album released. from indonesia
Man, in really hoping they do a collab with treyarch for the next black ops zombies and have Easter egg songs again ❤❤
Menyala abangkuhhh 💀💀💀💀💀
perfection visualized!
Progressive kontol
Wow
Absolutely beautiful! 🦇🖤🦇
Es Hermosa muy Hermosa
The only band that make sense lyrically❤❤❤
Masterpiece 😢❤
They should have called this album "skeletons in space"
dancing skeleton got me bawling my eyes out. this song is so beautiful. I feel it so deeply every time 😭
“LET IT GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooo!!!!” always gets me… such a beautiful song🤌🏽
😭
The 5 minute mark will forever be the perfect transition
This album is amazing, mature solid piece of music and writing. Screw the haters
I’ve been a huge A7X fan for over 10 years now so, I of course heard Cosmic when the album came out on June 2nd. That day was also the day I found out I was pregnant after several months of trying.  I’d listen to Cosmic almost every single day and cry to it because of how beautiful it was! Fast forward a couple months, Cosmic was also the first song I heard when I had my miscarriage. I broke down and cried uncontrollably. I ended up having 2 more miscarriages after that one and now every time I hear this song I imagine me with my 3 babies dancing in the wind amongst a sea of roses. It is hands down my favorite song of all time and I get emotional every time I listen to it. Thank you so much for creating this masterpiece.
Brooks yohohoo
It reminds me of Queen meets Yngwie and Friedman in a band together. Another masterpiece in effort and truly rewarding to listen too.
Is it weird that this what my mind painted as it/I heard this song for the first time quite a while back?
Geniais, como sempre
Words can not express my feelings  and gratitude.  Thank you, A7X.
Hmm.
I have a hate and love relationship with this song.  Although it is very powerful and beautiful, I just can’t help but get a feeling of emptiness.   I dunno what it is. It could be the calmness of the song to the sudden rise and rush of the instruments. The different tones M. Shadows sings, or the somber strings used within the song. And with the new addition of a music video to this song it just makes me wonder if my feelings are in par with the meaning of the song?   Aren’t we all the skeleton sitting in front of a clock wishing to experience life and the beauty of it but forced to be trapped forever counting down for a release?       The vibrant colors make me feel like we are too focused on how little time we have to notice the details of things we have or things we want forcing dreams we have to die dreams. I mean as shown in the video the skeleton day dreamt him dancing in the sand, only for it to turn night and reality hits that he was just sitting in a dark room. Waiting for the end.  I dunno what about it but this album in general gives me a good but emotional feeling. To sit down listen to the songs and really listen to every detail just makes this album better. It really makes the title make more sense. „Life is but a dream“.
JESUS LIVES
We actually live just waiting for our time to die, maybe that's the picture of this song.   So beautifull song..We love u A7x❤
You made me cry 😭 this is such a beautiful song
Damn this video is beautiful
Mannn, I do really want to see you guys perform cosmic live, but what a shame there's no ticket left for me🥲
Remember when a7x used to actually make and star in their own music videos? I like AI stuff too but this is just lazy
"Cosmic"  Fade From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye  Fate Has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone, I can't wait too long Fade  Love We loved so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right  Pain It found its way back in Until we meet again Into that good night  None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me Before the dawn of man, in castles made of sand There you'll find me Writing in the caves as fire lights the way There you'll find me Mask of royal glow don in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  Let it go Yeah Rings of dust and ice weightless in the night There you'll find me Let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me Before the dawn of man in castles made of sand There you'll find me Writing in the caves as fire lights the way There you'll find me Mask of royal glow don in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try I'm gone We loved so many times And in so many lives I'm gone Sometimes we got it right I'm gone It found it's way back in Until we meet again I'm gone Into that good
A7X indonesia 💥👇 ...
This song is so goddam beautiful I swear, almost been a year and I still get choked up. It captures the finality of life and irreversibility of time so well.
This is excactly how I pictured in my head how the journey would looked like from this plane to our eternal rest destination since the first time I’ve heard this song. It’s just amazing how magical and wonderful music can be by connecting with feelings and emotions. Bravo!!  Without a doubt, this is such a masterpiece. I agree when it comes to this song could be easily the best Avenged Sevenfold’s song so far!!

Don't let this masterpiece die for the younger generation ❤❤❤
Ramadan Kareem everybody ❤
Nitip sendal
I fucking cry every time I hear this song, especially the 'I'm gone'. Now I have a video to cry with, thanks A7X. Absolutely beautiful.
The dancing with the sunset is all I needed in this video. Thank you, Avenged Sevenfold.
I was expecting that the skeleton would dance in that part and it did... Now i am  happily sad....
😢😢
I watched this thing 10 hour's after it launch
This video is gorgeous and Cosmic is one of the most emotionally impacting songs I’ve ever heard. That drop from the solo into the piano and the tempo slowdown tries to get me every time and it is so easy to just let go from that part through to the wonderfully bombastic crescendo and the somber and thoughtful end. Beautifully crafted and composed and easily one of A7X’s best. I hope to see it live on the next leg when they come back West in the US.
Creo que mi comentario es unico en castellano. Gracias por tanto chicos, casi 20 años escuchandolos. Cada dia mejor, me encantaría poder presenciar algun concierto suyo. Se que hoy es casi imposible que vengan a mi pais. Sepan que los llevo en mi piel, Axel Lebersztein de Argentina
We need VR version for this!!!!!
Menyala abangku 🎉
Hermoso! Grandes!!
People who don't like a7x or people who say a7x only screams must watch and listen to this video clip...its beautifull soul
This song is amazing! Well done A7X!
Literalmente cósmico!!
once your time is up you must be called home. were with you till the end.
lagu baru kah ?
Seeing A7X live last night then this today. What an amazing show and visuals for the live performance of Cosmic. This visual for a music video was just as perfect.
MENYALA ABANGKU🔥
This is definitely better than Barbie taking pee and poo
This is one of those songs that just absolutely gives me chills. My deathbat tattoo sits proud across my shoulder blades and this song makes it flutter.
Maldita obra de arte... Sin palabras.
unus annus?
I wished that I can forget about "Cosmic" so that I can listen to it again, now my wish came true, It felt like it's my first time listening to COSMIC, THANK YOU
MASTERPIECE
Hearing this live had me ugly crying 100%
song given means that true in the life
This song is such an adventure from the beginning to the end.
Perfect

from within to without
I'm this New Age of Science
sunset.... the reflection of the Heavenly bodies......... Melodies from the 7strings of the heavenly Pendulum
Ahh yessss
5:00 This is exactly how I imagined it to look like in my head. I always get Little Big Planet 2 vibes from this song, it's really cathartic.
I hope someone plays this video on a big screen at my funeral.
What a beautiful video🥲
tapping into your Cosmo...... the power from within... the power of the STAR$ ZaNon
I like this son  Thank you for this A7X❤
Puedo interpretar con el vídeo y la letra que esto trata sobre toda la historia del mundo y el universo, al final llega al final de todo y voltea el reloj de arena queriendo decir que todo vuelve a comenzar y ese es el ciclo de la existencia, el esqueleto es la muerte y por eso se lo ve solitario pero disfruta ver cómo todo sucede mientras transcurre el tiempo.
Does the LIBAD grim reaper have a name yet?

8 hours
Fans called it! The countdown was for this! It's been how many months until they started playing cosmic live then this one. Beautiful song.
Que bello video!
I woke up to the countdown for this, it means so much to me while the others just don't understand.
😍 Adorably beautiful
Man, I just can't believe that imagine it EXACTLY as the video when I heard the song just released. It just fucking blown up my mind...
I LOVE IT! You guys will foREVer be my favorite band ever! ❤🤘
Fucking ❤ Masterpiece..
HERMOSO!!! ❤ 🇦🇷
is this the evolution of the a7x ?  just like LP  after the rev pass away, i dont follow this band anymore, until now. im pretty surprize by all the changes, music wise.
Keren, berasa dream theater
I lost my grandmother and cousin early last year. When this album came out and the first time I listened to “Cosmic” it gave me death and goodbye vibes. I lost my grandmother to pancreatic cancer. My cousin died from a drug overdose. But seeing that skeleton dance just gave me a calmness. Like they are in a better place. They aren’t suffering anymore. They’ve been “set free”. It’s been a long time since a music video made me tear up. But they were happy tears.
MV Cosmic yg sangat menarik, menyala abangkuu.......🔥
The style of stop Motion fits very well with this music video, undoubtedly a great song.
masterpiece songs ever🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Death is not the end. When the body perishes we are all connected in eternal consciousness.
GAK ADA OBAT
the dancing skeleton is a top notch
Sangat keren..
Kerennnn
HERE BEFORE 1 MIL VIEWS   👇
No matter how many times I listen to this song I get chills everywhere. Every. Single. Time. You guys are legends, and watching you all perform in Cleveland was definitely a check off my bucket list. Thank you.
Thank you guys SO MUCH for releasing a video for this song! This is my favorite A7X song of all time, and seeing this video in my YT feed totally made my day. Hell, it made my week! Thank you thank you thank you
Just a grown man crying through this MV's journey. I don't know, but I got that "there's something I relate to with this skeleton that I can't quite put my mind on" feeling.
When that 3:05 dropped, I know you're crying. Don't even tell me otherwise.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Headphone + Full volume = 🙌🏻🗿
Cosmic es una obra de arte 🥺❤
Obra prima! 😢
This song! I can’t listen to it without welling up
El mejor video a la mejor canción del álbum ❤
Kenapa dengerin cosmic malah kangen jimmy?🥺

I've been a fan from the beginning but this is getting weird

one word: ART!!!
What an AMAZING music video, I fucking love this song! it means a lot to me
OBRA DE ARTE PQP !!!!
It's like you guys forgot how to play your instruments.
So, death it's the most beautiful part of life?
Awesome ❤
Dancing in the Wind ❤
Truly amazing. This song speaks to so many people on so many different levels. Perhaps, somewhere deep down inside each and everyone of us is a piece of the cosmos. And we too shall become one with it, in due time.
Мужики, уже новый альбом пора презентовать, а вы только клип на старый сделали
So visually beautiful and fitting with the song. Bravo, gentlemen❤️
Nice! Definitely experimenting, a trip... https://youtu.be/2UOYX-bRlc0?si=_rWTk4jIFDyf01Co

Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
This is a journey, a wonderful journey of musicianship!
Still here for a7x song! The Rev must be so proud of you all !❤
This song is so fucking perfect
This is such a good song..😊 everything about it is just perfect
This is the perfect display of how it feels to listen to this song. 🫶🏻 LET IT GOOOOooooOooo
Hello people! I hope you all have a great day/night and that whatever is going on in your life turns out great love yourself and be kind bye bye :3!!!
I love this song so damned much. The album as a whole as well.
I want the lyrics please 😊
i know theres no lead guitar happening in the middle but damn id love a "guitar playthrough" kinda video on this from syn
I love you A7X. Rarely listened something so progressive and innovative. See you in Italy ❤
Thank god, I thought I’d never get merch from this tour, by the time I stood in line everything was out of stock 😅
DAMN!!!
Damn skelly boi was having a great time at the beach 3:29
Yess, i agree this song is multipart and hard to make it...but when i hear it to deep, i can't enjoy it. It depp song but not for listening in a thousand people....its hear in your heart.
Awesomeee!!!!
The beach section hit hard, damn. Thank you Avenged Sevenfold.
A melhor do álbum ❤
absolute cinema ✋️😐🤚
Masterpiece
That was beautiful.
Ficou incrível ❤
a7x🇧🇷🖤
Really cool how the fans made this one special. Yes this is what I imagine when I listen to this song, pretty accurate lol
It's weird in a good way because I can feel antic, energic and classic at the same time
This song just hits different. I can't explain, but it makes me cry every single time I play it. It's nice to know that a lot of people feels kind of the same. Thanks A7X for that masterpiece, love you!
Cements Life is But a Dream as my favourite album of all time.
SUATU SAAT DI MASA DEPAN GUA AKAN MEMBACA PESAN YG GUA TULIS INI☕☕🤩🤟

In my Era of indy pop punk or super heavy rock A7x is one of the best ever Hopefully this next album picks up the pace
Goosebumps! 🥹❤️
Your mind on 5 gum:
Estava no aguardo 🇧🇷❤️
the best thing my damn eyes have ever seen in my entire life
❤ This! ❤ 🤘
Just so beautiful 🙌
I'm soooo qhacin proud of that teenage boy, who after listening by mistake Darkness Sourounding, instantly  chose this band to be his favourite. Art is subjective, but in my ears, A7Xs Whole discography is art itself. Even the minor flaws, if the are any, put in the forefront every other wonderfully placed compositions as the 7+ minute experience above.  Thanks, foR EVerithing. \m/  P.s. Please Come to Greece.
This is my favorite song from the album. This video did not disappoint. In fact it might be the most beautiful video I've ever seen. I suggest watching it I'm the dark on a TV with the volume turned way up. It is an experience lol. Thank you and well done.
The solo part is exactly the same mental journey I have when I listen. Thank you A7X for this amazing album... Please come back to Brazil...
Nice
absolutely beautiful video for one of the best songs ever written. I can feel the emotion and feel the story. Outstanding job, I will forever love this band and what they do!
This is making me emotional and I love it
THE GOAT 🐐
wow!
Awesome 😍
Love from Turkey, hoping to see you perform here one day too ❤
Muito bom 👍
The skeleton dance seems like The Rev dancing 😢🤘 Love Avenged Sevenfold at all❤️
Love you guys, keep it up forever. seriously

When LIBAD first came out I couldn’t listen to Cosmic in public because it would make me break down in tears. Almost a year since the album released and I still get the sniffles listening to it… fucking love Avenged Sevenfold… A7X foREVer
This song always hits me especially seeing the skeleton dance. I lost my friend to suicide who was a HUGE Avenged Sevenfold fan a couple weeks before their release of Nobody. Hopefully she is happy listening to their album. Hearing this song always makes me cry so hard because she would have loved this album and experience.
"Sometimes we got it right"  You got 'Cosmic' right Avenged Sevenfold. Such a masterpiece, well done!
Ramadhan ya Ramadhan
this might be my favorite a7x music video ever. This was amazing and I cannot thank you lads enough for it.
I'm a Boomer and the only song that has ever hit me like this one was Comfortably Numb. Could you imagine what these guys could do with a full time virtuoso keyboardist? Kick Dream Theater's ass IMHO.
Man I havent given a fuck about this band since Waking the Fallen but I decided to check this record out because of how divisive the reaction was and Ill be damned if this isnt one of the densest, most eclectic in terms of Rock and Metal and passionately meticulous records Ive heard in a long time. With this song being an amazing standout. Its cool to see a band with their stature and status still care a lot and care about challenging themselves and their audience creatively and not just talking shit like most bands when they say that.
This song reminds me of my dad, my dearest friend who died a year and a half ago. Thanks to him, I fell in love with music and learned to see its beauty. We planned to have matching tattoos with the a7x theme, but unfortunately we didn't make it..  This song reminds me that he's still there for me. Maybe not physically, but somewhere out there, far away... He is everywhere where my love is. I know it deep down so I am trying to remember to be loving and always have a respect and place for true feelings in my heart, no matter how hard it could be. Thank you for everything, dad. I miss you everyday.
beautiful video. incredible music. You are my favorite band, and for me the best in the world. you are amazing
I lost my dad back in November. This song just hits you in the feels, and the video hits harder. I cried watching the skeleton dancing on the beach. Going to see them live in a few days on 3/23 and I will absolutely lose it when they play this one. 🌌💫
Feels like we’ve come full circle from dancing silly skeletons to a breathtakingly beautiful dancing skeleton. What a wild unbound ride it’s been!
Just absent, INDONESIAN, BALI 🖐
This is just an incredibly beautiful song
VEM PRO BRASIL LOGO A7X AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I fucking love you guys so much
Finally a video for my jam baby
Aleluiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
on fire
This is lame tbh
Setiap lagu anda diciptakan,disitu saya selalu melihat seni yang luar biasa. Saya selalu menangis tersedu sedu ketika mendengar karya yang begitu indah dari sebuah band dari Huntington Beach ini, terimakasih atas karya indah mu, semoga saya bisa mendengarkan selalu sampai selamanya. Salam hangat dari Indonesia 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
hmmmmmm...
When I turned 18, I got the Deathbat as my first tattoo. People told me it was dumb because they would be irrelevant in 10 years. 14 years later they are still my favorite band and their music has gotten me through everything life can throw at a person. Avenged Sevenfold is timeless, and their music will foREVer be a part of my life. Jimmy The Rev is smiling down at this masterpiece. Thank you Avenged for everything.
These guys used to be good now they such auto tune sounds ass
This song makes me lose my sh1t every single time I listen to it Amazing!
É a perfeição ❤
This is MASTERPIECE!!
Best song on the album, by a lot. One of their best ever. Brooks drumming in the last section is off the charts
what a masterpiece
❤❤❤
God, no matter how many times I relisten to this song, it still makes me cry. I rarely find a song that makes me feel like this.
The skeleton is me waiting for summer and then dancing of joy because I can finally feel the sun on the beach ♥ but the skeleton went too far with dr*gs xD Good song tho xoxo
🤘🤘🤘❤️❤️❤️BEYOND MASTERPIECE ❤️❤️❤️🤘🤘🤘
I miss Bat Country... But in all honestly, I'm just glad the boys are still doing their thing. No hate intended, Bat Country was just a better time in my life.
Rarely am I afraid to listen to or watch a song again. Many people rightfully love this, but I think few actually understand yet. I'm among those who were allowed to remember a piece of the everything... the immersive illusion of the dream makes you forget, but triggers like this let you remember briefly. It's not that which upsets me most, the feeling I can handle... I worry of turning on existence again: How messed up that any force would decide to keep one in this tiny speck of it all, something consciousness was not meant for, even after the point of this "test" seems to have been made long ago. The song itself was already accurate as it is beautiful... the clip too captures how it looks and feels to be unbound in space, I don't have direct experiences or memories but seeing some of the sequences I remember it all the same. For a comment on a music video, I think that's enough said... bless you for this Avenged ❤
This is why cosmic is my favorite song from the album! Listening to this song makes me think of the stuff me and my fiancé went through together to get where we are right now in life and A7X was our first show back in 2023 🖤
🤟🏼🇧🇷
♡♡♡♡ i love the a7x
I'm not crying you are 😭💕
This song is unbelievable, so many emotions
Coisa linda! 🖤
this song is a masterpiece.  when i did the virtual epicenes in Vegas it was my favorite one.
Mais uma pra minha coleção! 🤟🤤🤟   Viva o rock porraaaaaa
Untill we meet again…..🥺😭🥲
I dont like the bass drum sound in this song, i like band try new things, try different style of music, even i not big fans for their new stuffs, but great to see they keep making music.
Man, this shit hit me in the feels harder than the album did. That's somebody that has grown a matured at the same time as A7X, this is my favorite album. It's such a fucking journey
I love you A7X , i'm from Indonesia 🇮🇩
I hope this is one day the journey I will take.
😍😍
Great video. Although I was secretly hoping that a deluxe edition of the LIBAD album and some other songs would be released. But maybe next time... ♥
AMO VOCÊS MAIS QUE TUDO NA VIDA ❤️🇧🇷
Absolutelly Amazing. Wonderful. Perfect. I'm in tears 🥺❤️🌌💀
I loved this song, but I think it could have been produced better. the beginning of the song doesn't match the course it takes, it looks strange. but it is an emotional song in its final act. congratulations
A7X is a part of my life, that's foREVer
Perfect ❤
Gg!
Amazing guitar!!!
See yin'z at PPG paints arena here in Pittsburgh! Bring it Whackerman
Menyala avenged Sevenfold kuhh🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Gone but not forgotten...
Garbage
Did anyone notice that the last name of the director of this video perfectly embodies what is being depicted: Hopewell!  One of my favorite songs of all time.  Leaves me moved and spellbound.
❤
The skeleton dancing in the sunset is one the most beautiful things ive seen
Wow. That ending with the skeleton and the hourglass and the orchestra really choked me up and I was not expecting that to happen. This is why I love Avenged. They are one of the very few bands that can emotionally move me.
So beautiful…
Now we know what Jimmy's been up to
Stunning vid, beautiful song. Love it! Hell yeah, guys
Este vídeo musical se convirtió en uno de mis favoritos en la historia, gracias AVENGED, impresionante, magnifico, excepcional, no hay palabras para describir el sentimiento que transmite. La escena bailando en la playa... Ufff... Me hizo llorar, nuevamente gracias AVENGED, me han acompañado a lo largo de muchos años de mi vida ❤️‍🩹
aku tunggu di indonesia 25 mei 2024🔥🔥🔥😭😭
This is art 🖼️ 🎶 🌅
Lagu terbaik di LIBAD, menyala A7X 🤘🔥
Masterpiece ❤❤❤
🎼☕
Their new stuff just isn't very good, bummer
Grim reaper's day off be like
A beautiful video for a beautiful song. Wow.
Live this band listen to rhem my whole life im only 13
Another acid trip music video
See, don't dance to hard, or you'll dance cosmos through a whole cycle to a reset!
Marvelous Avenged Sevenfold this song its good to listen while I watch the rain on a gray day😊
Really Really Masterpiece😢😊
THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING  thank you a7x 🤘
Rest in peace  Father ❤
Let it GGGGGOOOOOOOHOOOOOAAAHHOOOHHHHH
My album of the year from my lifelong favorite band. Love the creativity and I intend to express myself through my own art just as you do. Thank you for all that you do.
I was recommended here while listening to the song “Sayo - Presidencial” 😅😅
💫💫💫
🔥🔥🔥
it's so good!!! 🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🔥🔥🔥
Good god, what the hell happened to A7X?!? After the Rev passed things went downhill soooo fast! Nightmare was the last great album from them. Hail to the King, The Stage and this new one is just complete garbage. Also Shadows vocals sound so worn like he's using all his strength to get a note right. I mean I'm 34, Waking the Fallen came out when I was in eighth grade and they became my favorite band. Lips of Deceit/Clairvoyant Disease/Eternal Rest/Trashed and Scattered/Brompton Cocktail/Victim...to this s&@t. I was such a fan that when I turned 18 I got a deathbat tattoo on my arm. Ever since 2013, I regret I did that EVERY SINGLE DAY. All the songs from the last three albums sound so mainstream and BLAND.  Btw, for those who really want to know how the Rev actually passed. He was at home sitting in a lawn chair drinking a beer when a blood clot traveled from his foot to his heart and killed him instantly. How do I know? Because at the time I was dating his cousin and she told me what happened.
I'm crying nonstop. This is so pretty, thank you!
THE SKELETON APPEARS!!!
Im not crying, you're crying 😢
Basically, this song makes me feel like I'm living a dream. And this is one of my favorite songs, because it makes me touch or feel, like those beautiful symphonies. And being prostrate on an aimless journey and just admiring the beauty of life.✨✨
Few bands can put so much emotion into a song as Avenged do awesome ❤
My best friend just took his own life. This video has me in tears.
I am truly so proud to say Avenged Sevenfold is my favorite band. This is the most beautiful and emotional song/music video I’ve ever heard. Absolute masterpiece A7X foREVer❤
É exatamente assim que nos sentimos ao ouvir COSMIC.... obg A7X !
menyala abangkuuu🔥👏
Very Cosmic.
Cool video..
This song reminds me of my final moments before I lost my grandma to cancer. A reminder from her that I'll find her in the end
Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade  Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
I'm not crying, I'm not crying... just grains of sand fell into my eyes
❤
I'm not crying, I'm not crying... just grains of sand fell into my eyes
Maravilhoso!
Outro vídeoclipe animado... já podem aproveitar e lançar as outras desse álbum assim mesmo.
Man... this was... i can't find words to describe it
Please bring this song when you tour Indonesia on May 25🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
The skeleton dancing is literally how I danced to this song love it ❤❤❤
Sounds more like Avenged Theater or Dream Sevenfold now. I understand bands change with time... but damn fellas.
Que banda senhoras e senhores!!!
Delightful
Delightful
Sampai bertemu dijakarta abang matt😂
One of the greatest songs of all time. Love this spot and love A7x, Avenged FoREVer!!!❤
El video es demasiado atingente a la música.  Puro arte ! ❤
My dog passed away 3 days ago. 14 years of life.  I miss you Gracie.  It just makes sense to dedicate this song to you.   I also love you guys for making this masterpiece.  Best song ever.  Gets me emotional everytime
in cosmic video, there you'll find me...
in cosmic video, there you'll find me...
in cosmic video, there you'll find me...
in cosmic video, there you'll find me...
🤘🏻🥹
Dude so fucking good thats amazing
Perfect song, i love love loveeeeeee COSMIC ❤❤
One of those songs that make dying less scary.
Existe um significado por trás desse clip que eu sei né ? Alguém explica?
We love you Jimmy <3
From concert to video! Transcends perfectly 🤘🏻🔥
Cette musique me donne des frissons ! 🫠
The music was going well, until this electronic part arrived. Unfortunately, bands end up succumbing to this kind of thing in order to stay in the mainstream. A feather. The last album that was really good was The Stage. This last work is well below expectations for the level that Avenged always performs.
Exactly how it looked and sounded on stage. *Chef's kiss*
I wish that i could heart this   Im am an avid user of acid and shrooms  And when you do them in abundance like me you dont even need to be Under the influence when you hear this song!   Truly a one of a kind song! A complete spiritual experience   Gave me bad goosebumps
A7x still rocks in some hearts of people
THERE YOU'LL FIND MEE... what a beautiful song, the skeleton dancing on a beach made emotional.
Song is amazing Heavy metal 🤘
Awesome song, but jamtracks in fornite when? Its criminal how they collabed but didnt even get into the music part of the game.
Woooow me hace llorar esta cancion 😢 beautiful song
Best song ever
Masterpiece!!! 🤘🏾🔥
😮😮😮😮
🤟
Mi abuelo murio hace casi 2 meses, hoy volvi a conectar con el, gracias Avenged, gracias por darme un ratito mas de mi abuelito. Gracias por darme un lugarcito a donde ir.
God, I love this song so much. Thank you Avenged Sevenfold ❤🖤
Bom
Omg…🥺❤️
Is this a Discworld reference?
MASTERPIECE
Time never ends but if it did Death would be there alongside it.
Ficou simplesmente absurdo!!🤍
Hands down… the best song on the album. Probably the best song since the nightmare album. Absolutely masterpiece. I really hope you can play this for us live at Download this year
Seeing Avenged Sevenfold perform Cosmos live was an enthralling experience, and of the best final songs I've seen at a concert yet.
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Only good song on the album sadly.
Cosmic is my fav Song from LIBAD. So good 😃👌🏻
bayangin mereka bawain lagu ini pas konser pake set panggung kayak di MV ini, wuih menyala abangku💃🏻🔥
I first heard this on my Pandora.  Did a painful dance (even if you're soaking wet, it's still not a fall unless you actually hit the ground), and managed to restart my phone without dying or destroying my phone.  Seeing him flying ... WIN
Nice music, but have let the “the stage” vibes behind.
What is this weak stuff A7X went soft like these new kids
I get so emotional every time I've listened to this. The video has me in tears. It's as beautiful as the song 🤘🖤
Music good, Video blah
AX7 have turned into a prog rock band, where's the anger?  Where's the angst?  Twiddly long riffs and even the videos have gone crap too.......
THE BEST THE BEST THE BESSTTTTTT❤❤❤❤
Eu, aqui do 🇧🇷, estou muito feliz!
🖤🖤🖤
this intresting sound to ax7
Menyala abangkuh 🔥
🦆 ing beautiful
Can I get everyone’s best interpretations for the very end of the video?
Ohh, hello Prog 😊
Sangat menyala abangkuuhh 🔥🔥🔥
Total Perfection ❤,  COSMIC ❤️ 😇🥰🔥🔥This Beautiful Masterpiece by A7X,THANK YOU,  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🤟🫶🤟🫶🤟🫶🤟
just another amazing song cosmic and mattel my two favorite songs on the new album
Esta genial ! :')
Such brilliant song and video too! U guys make my day again! Hope to see u in korea 🇰🇷
Beautiful
Not a coincidence that So Far Away can easily fit in with the background music of this song
What happened to these dudes
No way I was just listening through the album and found out they just released this video!
🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
can anyone tell me about what time they have going on stage this tour?
Am I the only one who cries every time I hear this song?
Somehow this video captured exactly how I feel listening to this song. Cosmic still amazes me how insanely good it is
Esse video me levou para outra dimensão
Cosmic and Exist are 2 of their best songs made.
We loved so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in Until we meet again Into that good night❤❤❤
I thought that was someone else's time, and he was the grim reaper since theres a bunch of hour glasses. But if it's his own, then why did he flip it back at the end? I thought it was to represent him dying, but he's still there. A7x left me with questions. Any ideas of what it means?
Well done boys well done. Keep it ☝
❤❤
beautiful
Best song of the album
awesome introspective <3
For some reason this song gives me the saame vibes as Foo Fighters - Rest. It feels so  similar in the emotion. And the most weird part is that the record for both came out on the same day.
i have no words... this video is unbelievable. the first time i heard the song, i felt this feeling and i thought "omg, it's impossible explain to people how i feel when i listen this". and now, you guys just created the best explanation for my feelings. thank you, thank you so much.
Ok I’ll break my listening all the way through rule JUST this once
Masterpiece. A one of a kind art. Thank you Avenged Sevenfold.
Damn this was pretty cool
Amazing... <3
VEM PARA O BRASIL!!!!
I am begging you A7X. Work band performance into the videeoooooooo plzzzzzz (cries)
Love the new vid … lots of secret occult symbolism there … hidden meanings. Saturn/Reaper … time is running out. Great matrix reset. Possibly the April 8th eclipse ? Nibiru ? You guys know what’s up 👍
An absolute masterpiece! The best song on the album 🖤
👍
Fucking badass makes me think of the one and the only JIMMY "THE REV" SULLIVAN  #foREVer  "There are hero's and there are legends, hero's get remembered, but LEGENDS never die"!!! It's all in your heart kid!!!!☠️🤘🦇🌌👑🥁🎹🎸🎤🎙🎼🎶🎵🎚 @avengedsevenfold
indonesian heree
Brook in One Piece Final:
Love this album, don't listen to the haters bros, keep making stuff like this record please! <3
Minha alma fica como 🤘💀🤘
Surreal and visually pleasing. I like it!
This is from now on UP THERE with ALPOH! 🔥 Soooo sick!
Is there anyone who's getting Terry Pratchett vibes?
Eu sou grato por ter assistido essa obra prima, que vibe indescritível.  Ah, essa dança na praia, que momento! Obrigado, Avenged Sevenfold.
like sand through the mf hourglass, so is the days of our lives
🖤
I knew I shouldnt have put ayahuasca in with my cheerios this morning.
E6aтb как ребята"повзрослели"👍только что смотрел "bat country",а потом этот клип клип-такой контраст!!!
Beautiful ❤🔥
We need Beautiful Morning next
Imagine watching this music video while absolutely tripping balls 💀
This isn't a music video. This is a full-on cinematic experience complete with an incredible score.  This would be amazing in theater! 🤔
Ohyeah
Love the video and an amazing song to see performed live! I left Key Bank in Buffalo thinking about Cosmic and what I just witnessed. Brilliant!
Lagu yang sangat..indah...
This is the only DECENT song on the album. Not gonna lie the album is ass. This is not Avenged Sevenfold. They tried writing like this and it failed. I understand experimenting but its just not it. This song is 5/10 to me and its the best song. Yikes.
Best song of the new album
There you'll find me...
That was really cheesy. The animation as always was good, but I feel that the director took this as a joke, and a chance to make people laugh. I don’t see this song that way.
Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade  Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
Favorite band for literally a year...
This song literally did something to me when I first heard it and continues to give me chills. The music video is PERFECT. It's like exactly how I picture in when I listen to it just laying in bed. A7X continues to blow me away. So proud to be a fan and excited to see what's ahead.
This song is a M A S T E R P I E C E ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why the hell I'm crying with this video...is just beautiful.
Idk man. I just can’t get into this new shit. The musicianship is obviously amazing but it’s just not for me at all man. I’ll stick to the incredible earlier shit I grew up on.
Crise existencial da morte, morte dançando, caveira gay, caveira queimando os gay, caveira com balinha, que saudade de clipe mais esforçado, mas a musica ta legalzinha
Beautiful..❤
amazing
this is how that countdown was made for!
Nice song, like my comment if you are Indonesian
❤
i have such a hard time with their new stuff :( it just doesnt sound like A7X , guitar masterpieces etc.... just shows the importance the rev held in this band :( still love you guys
beautiful song.. menyala abangku🤘🔥🔥
Fantastic song man
Wow ❤
Absolutely beautiful. One of the best songs they’ve ever written. That solo is perfection.
Goodbumps..chills. all of it. This song was so dam good live. A7X foREVer
Stunning 💕 🔥🔥🔥
Gw suka lagu ini ❤ suka a7x dari sejak 2004 sampe skg... ❤❤
its like a dream theater track :)
This single is absolutely beautiful but I can't get by the vocalist
This might/ IS the best song from the album. I do like some of the the other songs ofc.
rapaz
Death dancing on a beach.... This is art!
What a goddamn well made music video!
🔥🤘🔥
"CREEPER" {Official Music Video} https://youtu.be/jMfiQFiaS_M?si=dLs0qOheK3M3oEN8
Beautifully poetic.💀
I never thought i would see the day Avenged Sevenfold would put out a Church Banger....
__ AMAZING videoclip !!  but you guys can check my channel for other option videoclip of  "cosmic" __
On my birthday.... 🎉 thank you avenged sevenfold. You know just what I need in my world. I had a nightmare of the ocean last night and I swear this song brought it all back to me when I woke up.
This song makes me think this is a message to humans from God. Such a beautiful work of art @avengedsevenfold
Best song of the album with ordinary
This is the heights of musical excellence. What a perfect fusion of music concept and art that matches. Incredible.
This record is masterpiece!
Can’t help but feel the Rev through this one 😢❤
Menyalah abangkuuh 🔥🔥🔥
Definitly not for me..
OMFG!!! 🤟
Masterpiece, so moving this is real art !! Music industry is so commercial nowadays !!
I'm not saying you should do mushrooms....but if you do, put this on🤟💀👍
Me: this DMT is weak af! *Moments later*
I lost my beloved 9 year old dog two days before the album came out. When I heard "Cosmic" for the first time, all I could think about was her and the happiness she brought into our lives. Almost a year later, it's still difficult to listen to it without leaving a tear.
Iv been saying for months that this should have been the single off this record..
Amazing 🤘🏼🤘🏼
Hated the album on release. Cannot lie. My god what a phenomenal album it is. Gives me so much emotion. Never cried so much at a collective piece of music. AV7X forever!
Even death is depressed from pulling the strings in "the stage"
Maybe This Is Matt's Outpouring Song For REV And Maybe This Is The Song For "FICTION" Cosmic = There You'll Find Me Fiction = I hope you'll find your own way, when I'm not with you tonight. WeLoveYouJimmyfoREVer❤️
I love this video. I'd love to hear others' interpretation of it since I can't seem to interpret it myself
MASTERPIECE!
Sorry pero los vídeos de este disco si parecen ya se señores cuarentones jugando con los efectos de la cámara. Jajajaj el stop motion está muy cool pero lo demás meh
So beautifully done. Giving me Pink Floyd vibes
There you'll find meeeeeeeeeh
Beautiful. Thank you to all involved for sharing your art ❤
I feel so old after seeing the video😢 i mean, looking that grim reaper...... Time has passed.  I started love a7x at age of 15 y.o. Now I'm almost 30.....
"Human, you do not leave life. You follow it into the next Chapter." - Reaper by Jinya

"Rev" very excited for this album. cause fiction being the successor to Libad's album indirectly, you must be aware of it, God beside you jimmy 😢
Those “I’m gones” at the end always hit me. This song is nothing but a masterpiece and the video is amazing.
For my father who has been So Far Away in the stars of the Comic or 6 years..
This is a song that will forever be remembered in our hearts.
PLEASE SING THIS SONG IN INDONESIA IN 25 MAY 2024 !!!
Death's Cosmic sea reference?!?!😳
Beautiful wow !!
Como ficou show esse clip que foda que musica.... 🤟
Absolutely love it guys rock on 🤘
I've been listening to you guys since I was 4, I'm still jamming out to them to this day. I wanted to go to your concert again for a second time but couldn't becuase the nearest one is on Easter. Also, your music has helped me through rough times, You guys are amazing, keep up the good work. foREVer.
Saya tidak bisa bahasa inggris tapi saya menyukai karya avenged sevenfold, dan saya orang INDONESIA
Really brings a tear to my eye every time. A masterpiece
A7X can turn anybody into a metal fan. They are pure magic.
Perfeito ❤
Idk, this is makes feel's me sad.. period
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍
Beautiful
🔥🔥🔥
Holy shit i didnt expect cosmic to get a MV
2:04-3:04 me pulling up to the function when they tell me there’s alcohol(I’m about to get diabolically wasted):
Banger🔥🔥🔥
Jesus Christ
❤️ Avegend Sevenfold ❤️
This is a masterpiece! I love this track so much. From the first time I heard it in June 2023 to today it hasn't lest any of its magic and still sends me in to goosebumps chills. Chris Hopewell's video just adds to that magic - the skeleton dancing on the beach; perfection! Thank you A7X, thank you
Just perfect!
My fiance passes away from a terminal illness this past August/2023. We both love and loved A7x. I don't want to get into details but in her final days on hospice she couldn't move, eat, walk, or talk. I played all her favorite A7x songs while she was in bed.  She never heard this song before so I played it at the end of the playlist. She passed away that morning and this was the last song she ever listened to. To say this song has meaning to me is an understatement. The fact it was written during her illness and was the last song she heard. It makes me cry every time but with mixed emotions.  Sadness but knowing she's at peace. I think the flipping of the hourglass at the end symbolizes that even though our loved ones who passed are waiting for us they want us to continue to live our lives to the fullest.  I love you with all my heart Kristina❤. She was 33 years old.
SIMPLESMENTE MAGNIFICA
It has Dream Theater and Anathema vibes
My favorite song off the new album 😊
This video just beautifully captures the feel of the song so well. Great job Avenged Sevenfold!
I knew this song would have visuals that would go crazy. Love to see it.
Sigh... Fine I will listen to the album again
THERE YOU'LL FIND MEEEEEE🌌🌠
Trippy
The visual of this song…is just. PERFECT.
Di tunggu di jakarta paman paman ku ❤ 🤘 MENYALA ABANGKUH 🔥
Pengen beli baju nya , tapi ga punya duit 😅😅😅
The best song in the album!
Absolutely amazing song !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing.
O SOLO DE GUITARRA MAIS LINDO JÁ INVENTADO PELO HOMEM! PQP! VAI SE FUDEEEEEEEER!!! ⏳🔥🔥💥
I prefer Matt shadows over Matt Sanders
Them finishing their live show with this song... messes up with your mental health for days! you become eternal for couple of minutes and then it's all gone. :,))
El sonido de A7F es único y nadie más lo tiene. Desde su canción 1 hasta la fecha siguen siendo ellos. No han cambiado nada esos son artistas con talento en verdad. La menor voz. Las mejores guitarras, La mejor batería. Son unls genios. Queremos más canciones por favor. Hagan algo como Unholy confesions o a little piece of heaven. Los amo❤
Terrible video xD hahaha but hey... song is epic
❤⭐⭐⭐⭐

A suffer, struggle, peace, and forgiveness. This song really made a smile of me when I hear it. Cause my life recently feel so badly. Cannot accept the fact that I made some mistake in the past, and it's teach me how to let it go and give me some peace and forgiveness from every suffer and struggle. 😊

I gotta smoke then watch this again... brb
El vídeo es la experiencia exacta que experimento cada vez que la escucho, y creo que es lo que querían plasmar...ese magnífico viaje extrasensorial al que te conduce la canción 😊 enhorabuena 🎉
Thank you for making my life better
This song makes me think of my mom every time. The music video just drove that further home. Easily my favorite a7x song to date.
I really hate this new a7x and album
wysi
❤❤❤❤❤
It made my day😭😭😭😭😭😭
Brooo😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Big avenged fan here, but damn, their videos suck LOL
Timing of this couldn't be more perfect 🎉💀
Leaving this comment here so that everytime someone likes it, it will remind me to listen to this masterpiece

Thank you A7X, from Indonesia 🤘
Oh no fucking way

I must stop drugs 😭😭

A7X>>>>>
Yayyyyy
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
😭😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😍
Thank you guys!
Rip rev aka jimmy
Omg another masterpiece
Legendary
I love this so much ❤❤
Damn I don’t know why this song, especially the ending, gets me so emotional, but dammit I’m tearing up at work 😅
Been waiting on this for months. Had a bad day at work, went on break & watched this. Immediate peace. Goosebumps at 5:10. Favorite bands for 10+ years ❤️
My favorite from the album!
This song always makes me think of my mum who passed away a few years ago.  There's a moment in this song that sounds like a heart rate monitor and then the music explodes... It always makes me imagine my mums spirit ascending into the cosmos, and the way they depicted that in this video perfectly matched my imagination.  Such a beautiful song. I really hope they play this at Download Festival. I'll definitely cry.
Jimmy would've love this song
Ngerii ahh lagu ieu🔥🔥🔥
sounds nice
Essa música... Simplesmente uma obra de arte! Obrigado Avenged!
What I hope is that A7X is like this, like the albums of old, I miss A7X making songs like the albums of old
Much MUCH better than some of the other stuff I've heard from that album. Guess I really need to listen to it as a whole and these random songs might make a little more sense to me!🤘🏼💙
Never have I seen the physical version of how a song makes me feel, until today. Wow.
Ok eu chorei
A7X Indonesia ♥️♥️
Favourite song ever,dont understand the video concept
Damn what a beautiful song
Amazing travel 🥺🤯😭🌹
Cuando escuché por primera vez la canción, fue cuando lanzaron el nuevo álbum pero ahora con este video me doy cuenta que así como Mat dijo en alguna entrevista. Una vez que volvemos de visitar los otros mundos, regresamos con una visión global del todo.
WYSI
😍😍😍😍
Can't wait to see this live and in person on Saturday! I'm probably going to start crying.
I’d like to thank everyone who worked on this masterpiece of a video, as well as the band themselves because this isn’t just a video and a song. Many people forget that music is an art form, and Cosmic is here to remind us of that. I’ve never encountered another song as moving to me as this one, and every single time I listen to it, it takes everything in me not to burst out sobbing. It’s a masterpiece that helped me through some dark times, and I’ve emerged a better person from it. So, thank you, to Chris, Matt, Syn, Brooks, Johnny, Zacky, and all of the people in the background who made this happen.   The Rev would be proud.
🎉❤😂
There are some songs that just hit your soul. This is one of them.
Brought to you by an ayahuasca retreat and M Shadows.
The made the exact music video of the images i saw in my mind when i first heard this song.
Menyala abangkuhh🔥🔥🔥
Whoa, after watching this, it took me 5 minutes to compose myself before I could leave my office.
Bawain di indonesia nanti ya..
Who else start to cry when that piano part starts?  Everytime I listen to this song, it reminds me of many things that make me cry again. And now it has visual which makes me cry louder because this is definitely what I pictured about the song.
My new favourite!! The guitar solo 😭 Why is every new A7X music so beautiful?🥹 I wish they're active again like they used to.
the Evolution of A7X Music really make me emotional
Fucking goosebumps and tears. Best song on the album, by a mile.
There you'll find me
AH KEREN BANGET KAYA DR. STRANGE ❤❤❤❤😭😭😭😭
The best song they have made in 13 years
Love you guys, thank you for this magnificent song <3
“Lá você me encontrará 🪐”
My dad and I are very tight. Dude’s my best fuckin friend hands down and I’m his. We don’t say “I love you” though.   His health has gone south, I haven’t seen him in over 3yrs and he texted me he missed me about 4-5 months ago out of the blue. I didn’t know what to say so I replied: “Dancing in the wind as roses born again…there you’ll find me”  He replied with “Love you too”   I’ll love this song forever. It’s perfect
F#ck yes!!!
GOOSEBUMPS
I want scream and natural born killer to have a official video song ngl
Not the avenged sevenfold I used to love, too bad
Akhirnya keluar juga official videonya 🔥
Good 🤌
🌹
Best band on the planet ❤
Masterpiece
I love this song it sounds so goddamn good😭🖤
Obra prima!!
MASTERPIECE! MAGESTIC! SENSIBLE! ITS A HONOR TO WATCH THIS BAND EVOLVE! DANCING IN THE WIND... AS ROSES BORN AGAIN... THERE YOU FIND MEEEEEEEEEEE! LOVE FROM BRAZIL 💌
This song always makes me so emotional, just the thought of not feeling nothing and just utter bliss would be amazing
Played this on heavy repeat after my old girl Dogg died. Now it's her song. FoREVer
The solo is amazing my dudes
I've come to enjoy another masterpiece from one of the best bands I've ever heard in my life ❤ A hug from Brazil! A7X
I have NEVER been so obsessed with an album!
i miss the Revs musical influence and skill in songwriting
Worst song by avenged sevenfold
Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade  Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
Really made us wait a whole day live for then to release a music video official. . . Fair enough.
that was fucking beautiful i have tears rolling down my face as i type this
😍😍🥺
Hot take: this is the best A7X song
Waiting this song for concert at JAKARTA 🔥🔥🔥
Belleza de rola
As someone who's not a huge A7X fan, but I can certainly respect the musicianship, this album was nothing short of phenomenal.
🪐Amazing 🥹🌅🌌
This album taught me an important lesson. When it came out I hated it... I was expecting the same band that made City of Evil, but somewhere around the third listen, I realized how narrow minded and just plain stupid that was. This is a band that has grown and changed just as much as I have grown and changed. It wasn't fair to expect that they wouldn't change. Now this is one of my favorite albums of any band and I have listened to it through close to 100 times, far more than any prior A7X album. Now I listen to each album as a new thing and I don't compare them to the past anymore. I have fallen in love with music again.
It seemed Continued from " the stage"
God this is absolutely horrible just when I thought that this album couldn't be any worse oh my God this is worse than St anger by Metallica for shame
This song always gets me choked up and I have no idea why. Just hits that spot 🤟
I was expecting for a cosmic live video, but this is good as well. A treat is a treat lol Thank you @avengedsevenfold y'all never disappoint 😎🤘🏼
Really glad they chose this one as their next single/video, it's a really beautiful piece of music. It also happens to be my favorite song on their new album. The second half really reminds me of my grandfather
No wayyy!!!
Dust to dust.
Nice
This is my favorite guitar solo off this album. I love playing it
joss
Waiting 20 hrs was so worth it
For you. My star in the sky. I'll see you again one day my baby girl ❤
fastest click of my life
🖤♥️❤️‍🔥😻
Dollar store version of Exist :p
If I want to listen to something soft and emotional I'd put Muse on. What the hell is this? I want 90's - 00's A7X: Afterlife, Batcountry, Natural Born Killer, Nightmare.
Sahur
As fire lights the way, those of us who know, don't ever stop that fire from enveloping those we love and cherish!  We are each other's fires! ❤‍🔥
Super cool that A7X recognize that this is a fan favorite off the album and decided to make a video for it.
💀🥀🖤🖤🖤💙💙💜❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🌅☠️
As much of a good song this is, I’m really tired of people saying “THIS IS THEIR MASTERPIECE 😭”. Just cause something is epic and about space doesn’t make it amazing lmao. I can pick a song off of each of their other albums that kicks the shit out of this song. This shit gets old after I hear it more than once in a week lmao. Afterlife? Nightmare? Save Me? ALPOH? Bat Country? The Stage!?! THOSE are all time great songs that they have produced. Like I get it it’s the best song off the album, but to call it their masterpiece seems more like a coping mechanism since they took 7 fucking years to release it…
Incredible. No more words needed.
Avenged Sevenfold lost his ability to make songs without The Rev... the Hail to the King album was not fantastic, but has great songs, and feels like Avenged Sevenfold. after Arin, it seems like everything is going down
BROOOO this is sooooo awesome!!!!
Perfectly describe the whole song, bravo!!
Amazing theme ❤❤❤
I think someones on shrooms
Indonesia menyapa
Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Thank you, guys, for giving this remarkable song the video it deserved.
Come back
That breakdown has me trippin balls, sober
So good!! 💜
Killed it once again. Thanks for the beautiful song and beautiful imagery.
Thanks, for this Experience ❤  I Loved ❤😊
I love the happy Grim Reaper SO MUCH!! This IS BEAUTIFUL 🥲😭❤️🫶🏻🤘🏻

Indonesia mana suaranya
this song is so beautiful that I wanna die ASAP to dance in the wind as roses born again
Hahahah yeahhhh
I was about to go to bed.. dis song banger tho
The best!!
CONGRATULATIONS AVENGED SEVENFOLD VERY HAPPY FOR THIS SONG, I REALLY LOVE IT, LOVE YOU ALL, LOVE THE VIBES OF THIS SONG🥺❤❤
Beautiful - the cyclical nature of the lives we live is mirrored in all things we do. Thank you!
Fucking brilliant
Avenged falecido, clipe deve ter custado um pastel com caldo de cana
The song I was waiting for the most !!!!!
MASTERPIECE
i called this when the stream went live, so in love with this
Cosmic to me is musically, lyrically and technically the best song A7x has ever made.
What an unbelievable song this is
Time to listen to this album again
There is nothing new underneath the sun..
🤯🤩
Simplesmente perfeito, apaixonado nesse clipe
☄️🤌🏻
Amazing ❤
Sooo beautiful... 😍😍😍  Poetic!! Masterpiece!!! ❤👏👏👏

Dope. 🔥
Best song for a shroom trip, it'll make you cry 💚🤟🏼
Best song lol
Warning Avenged Sevenfold has hit Peak psychedelic existential crisis mode
a llorar juntos..
Nope. A7X have lost their way. Up till this album I've loved what they have done and accomplished but I have no idea what this crap is. Get back to your roots.
Heavy Metal
I lost my 19 year old son, Jacob, to Osteosarcoma in October of 2023.  A very rare form of bone cancer that only affects 3 out of every million people.  He loved Avenged Sevenfold and I prayed that he would live long enough to be able to hear Life is But a Dream, as we followed it's production over his 2 year battle.  Thankfully the album released in 2023 and he loved it.  I took him to the Camden NJ show in a wheelchair on July 18, 2023 and it was my favorite memory with my son.  He wore an Avenged Sevenfold tshirt at his funeral and he was buried in it.  His prayer card has verses from the song So Far Away on it.  Thanks to the band for a night we will never forget and for bringing my son and I closer together.

I would love to see a music video for the god trilogy
😮 🥹😱
and thus death reached its enlightenment, only Jesus Christ can give eternal life, he conquered death
🔥🔥🔥
Hace un año creo que al igual que todos los que escuchamos la canción... lloré, la canción es hermosa y precisamente imaginé el coro como se ilustra en el vídeo. Simplemente el juego de colores, con la similitud de lo imaginado con lo visto hoy... es más que hermoso.  Siento una conexión hermosa con esta banda, la amo tanto... y el simple hecho de que sacarán esto un día después de mi cumpleaños... me hizo llorar una vez más. Los amo a7x
Suck the guittar 😮
I've been waiting for this sweet!!
I've never clicked anything so fast in my life. Infinity/10
I cried the first time listening ing to this song and now the video again 😭
So healed 🥹💕
So much better than the so-called Top 40 crap today!
Essa é a primeira música realmente cativante desse novo trabalho, tipo a primeira impressão, algumas das outras músicas demorei um pouco pra assimilar aínda
Drugs were involved in the making of this video lol
Does this give parabola vibes?
They finally played it live and now a music video so much love for this song
I still can't believe I got to hear this song live the first time they ever played it. You know the setlist is amazing when both Cosmic and Roman Sky are on it
That was beautiful!
Words can't describe how emotional this masterpiece makes me feel. And the video, spot on!! Thanks for this incredible experience!
damn bro, what a perfection of creation, Rev's soul is here in this song 🖤❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Theres something about that line 'there you'll find me' that is so chilling. About the afterlife and seeing your love again...
I'M GONE
fortnite
I feel this song is connected to my soul;  I really love astronomy philosophy and science, and I so connected to this song and the lyrics...  Thank you universe for my favorite band  A7X and this masterpiece - Cosmic🌌⏳️
*pog*
A fight we’ll never win…. And time again we try…
This song and this vídeo are a masterpiece
MASTERPIECE 🔥🔥🔥
Still here 🖤
the reaper is giving me charon vibes
Absolute Cinema!
Oh yeah NOW they wanna start playing it live smh 😮‍💨
Conseguiu superar o clipe de nobody
HOLY SHIT we just talked about this!
Awesome!!
This was AMAZING live!!
Incrivelmente lindo🌹
Avenged has always been the best group ever, in my opinion . This song, gives me a bit of a nostalgic taste from the old albuns and songs like critical acclaim and victim, or even the most underrated song from avenged sevenfold, which is "until the end".
Wow. Just wow...that was beautiful. And everything I thought it would be. 😢❤
Instant tears.  When my dog passed I posted a video of him walking on the beach with this song playing.  ❤️‍🩹
THANKS AVENGED SEVELFOLD! THANK YOU SO MUCH!
they really spent all the budget on nobody's video
No plot, only abstraction.  Cool😊
beautiful
this is the extended version of the M.I.A solo that all your fans where dreaming off
Such a beautiful song tbh. Favourite in the whole discography. (Mattel and nobody is 2nd and 3rd)
Holly shit
❤
Damn I got goosebumps watching this definitely a masterpiece. A7X FoREVer 🤘
You can find me in the cosmic depths of your heart…
I was at the live debut of this song 🤘🤘🤘
❤
certified epic
This one has slowly grown on me.
Best song off the new album! Thankfully they chose those for the latest video!
Powerful stuff… makes me happy to be alive and enjoy the time I have here and that one day we will all be cosmic dust ❤
Acabei de assistir essa obra prima  Obrigado Avenged Sevenfold, por fazer esse espetáculo musical na era das trevas musicais !
Woah! Blown away Amaaazing video!!❤
Will A7X be great again?
lit
This is exactly what I imagined a music video for this song would look like!
Jesus, AVENGED JESUS BRO, JESUSSSSSS O MY GOD
It makes me so happy reading these comments- as this song was so magical to so many others as it was to me. Literally had me in tears when I first heard it driving to work. This album cannot be put into words, there’s so much to take in. Thank you avenged sevenfold for taking your time with this one. The outcome is more beautiful than anything we’ve gotten so far. Can’t wait to see you again live!
My light in the darkness ❤
Loving these new music videos, this is exactly how I imagined this song to be in a music video🔥
Hello future me. Hope you’re listening to this song
Cosmic is like Avenged Sevenfolds version of Runaway by Kanye. Just a beautiful masterpiece with so much heart and soul put into it. I'm glad finally got a music video to accompany it
Epic 🔥
Added to my playlist already! Wow, too good!!!!
that Beatles suspense always gets me.
This is without a doubt in my mind, the greatest song they have ever made, and they are a band known for having amazing, epic, anthemic songs
Fucking brilliant!❤
Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
My childhood fav band till now❤
MASTERPIECE 🔥🔥🔥
I am from Indonesia zackyy .. saya berasal dari pekalongan Indonesia jawa tengah 🤣 di sini penggemarnya sangat banyak
It's beautiful 😢
Cosmic, We love you y Nobody son las cerezas del pastel del álbum.
What are we doin guys ..
My absolute favorite song off the album
damn this piece of art just broke my soul
MASTERPIECE!! Thank you guys! This is a gift for us!
❤❤❤❤
This song and video reminds me what happens when i won't be here anymore and my loved ones have to carry on without me. It also reminds me of the passing of my elder family members whose memories i hold very dearly in my heart. Thank you A7X for embracing this memory and warming my heart with it.
The amount of goosebumps I got from 5:10 on is unspeakable… absolutely Beautiful
LOVE THE VIBESSSSS!!!😭
In the setlist of the cd we have the sequence:  Cosmic; Beautiful Morning;  And...  Easier...  But you can do a mix of "Cosmic" and later "Easier" and it fits well to listen together in sequence kkkkkk  And finally...its a beautiful morning, its a beautiful day kkkkkkkk
Love this and loved the new record!!!
We loved so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right :)
How is it thos video was released an hour ago and has 7,900 likes but only viewed 5,000 times. Im so confused 😂
Chills
i dont belive what am hearing  it is like heaven  i feel with complicated feelings  😂😂😂😂 My beloved bat company band  no you are higher level than just band  you are my brothers ❤
this made me cry at work
Dancing in the wind, as roses born again ❤️❤️❤️ The BEST song
💥
Fan forever 🤟🤘🤟🤘🤟🤘
This was absolutely beautiful. Nice touch with the iteration of the hourglass from Nobody. I don’t know if I’ve ever cried to a music video before but I did just now. I got the same vibes from this as I did when I first heard it and fell in love at the listening party at Area 15 in Las Vegas last year. I knew the song was special then and words can’t describe how much it means to me. If this is what awaits us in the afterlife I’ll be at peace. I’ll be dancing through space and time with the ones I love by me. Thank-you A7X.
Los amo, los amo demasiado 😥 gracias por tanto
It seems like the reaper from "Nobody" decided to go on his own spiritual journey.
Make the most out of your time in this weird dream..✨❤️
Absolutely beautiful you can make a grown man cry😭
Next station MATTAL Pls🥹🥹
Life:)
this music video fits this song perfectly! I cant listen to this song now without watching the video too! truly amazing!!!!!
I don't understand it.. But, this made me cry. A7X for life...
Finally🔥
indonesia watching
See u in jakarta☠️
Beatiful, just beatiful
come on.....
nope. back to city of evil. real band, real skill. not computational and weird voices.
According to my hunch, yesterday I commented on live
best of the best  avenged the love of my life  you are awsome guys  your fan from Syria it is my dream to meet you and play my guitar with my holy brothers  love you so much 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
I'm here before 1m view's
❤❤❤❤❤
That lyrics was so deep about spirituality
ah masterpiece🙌
avenged sevenfold's never disappoint me!!! this is so fckin' worth it after spend about 24 hours on youtube. y'all such a fuckin' badass!!!🤘🔥
Chills.. Good job guys.
Long time fan of A7X but I just couldn't get into this album, listened to every track and tried.  Oh well, glad others do.
Where is the members?
I love this song, I love this band lml A7X foREVer
Amazing guitarrist.
All that hype...
I don't know why I still cling on the hope of the good old City of Evil or Waking the Fallen by clicking on a new Ax7 video...
First time I heard this album this song blew me the fuck away, at the time it’d been a long while since I had listened to an album start to finish, there’s not a bad track in this one, the next day I took some mushrooms and listened to the whole album again, and holy shit, when I say mind blowing, I mean it, it took me for a ride across the cosmos, every little creative decision in this album was expertly crafted, and this is by far my favorite work by the band, not many artist can craft such a unique masterpiece 23 years into their career, it was for sure worth the 7 year wait, I can’t wait to see how they will follow this one up
Video is meh. Song is easily in their top 5 all time.
Amazing!!!
Let's go
it started off damn good but then slowly it turned into modern garbage :/
Basically how I imagined it when I first heard it
Singer is terrible
Finally❤
Truly cosmic.
Honestly, one of the best music videos by avenged so far. It makes me feel even more what this song made me feel before
Please come to turkey
Favor as always Avange seven fold❤❤❤
This song reminds me of The Rev😢🔗
I follow you
Beautiful. 🌌 🙌🏽
TOP 1-3 songs ever made by them! Imo
cant wait to hear this master piece here in Mexico, replaying this all day long
Such a beautiful song 🔥
❤❤❤
Ohhh ini kejutannya live kemarin 😂 this is amazing "COSMIC"
This is such a nice song
MENYALA ABANGKU🔥🔥
We love u!!!! BRAZIL 🇺🇸🇧🇷
A7X 🤘🖤
wow.
One of the songs that's actually a cohesive song on the album
Amazing, I hope Jimmy can see your development going in the right direction❤❤
...beyond forever, I'll follow you 🖤
The skeleton dancing on a beach by a sunset is the perfect imagery for the euphoric part of this song. The director nailed it. Also, the song itself is one of my all time favorites by A7X. Just a beautifully written song.
I've always imagined this song as that one doctor strange scene where he's in space and touches the butter fly and Flys through dimensions
Cool
the reaper dancing in the sun like if he was there to guide you toward the final light, to just finally make fun of you because there is nothing , he is all and a part, you are a part and you are nothing
from Malaysia ❤️🥺
My aunt who i was super close with, passed away two weeks ago from colon cancer. We LOVED A7X, I actually got my music taste from her. She raised me on classic metal, ozzy, pretty much everything from the 80s and 70s, the start of metal. When i found out she liked a7x too it brought us so much closer. The skeleton dancing made me happy, because not only did she have colon cancer but she was paralyzed from the waste down to to her ex husband shooting her when i was 6 years old. When she died, i know wherever it is we go when we die she was dancing. Hopefully to the rev playing some kick ass drums.  The day she died i passed her old apartment she hadnt lived there in ten years, but as i passed it Far Away started playing and it made me cry. But now i have this song to imagine how happy and pain free she is, and i can remember the amazing times i had with her.
Lets goooooo
Couldn’t hold it in exploded immediately!
I really love this art style. You guys have truly gone above and beyond with this album. I can’t wait to see what else you guys do.
Finally it's here, and it's all we wanted to be!
transcending
This song makes me feel so glad to stay alive and say thank you God for everything.
Welp, idk what i just watched but great song lol
Fuck yeah 🖤🖤🖤 ✨
Welcome to Indonesia
I think this is one of A7X’s best songs, ever. Might not be the same youthful, brash energy of Waking the Fallen or City of Evil, but it’s sooooo epic!
One of my favourite songs 🔥
Oh yeahhhhhh
Holy shit this is amazing
Anyone hearing a "new" solo in the background of the outro? I've listened to this album dozens of times I never heard the solo in the end. Is this a different mix was that added in? Idk how I missed it.
I don’t love the new album tbh but m shadows vocals are incredible throughout 👌🏽
I love these ballad type A7X songs
The drumming ..omg...Amazing
I see Jimmy in this skeleton. I see him enjoying the music that his friends made with so much effort. I loved this video. I love you!
Was just re-watching the Toronto show, reminiscing on how great this was live! Happy to see the video pop up! 😍
You guys need to make an RPG with some of this as battle music:)
"You can't win this fight" -Welcome to the Family. "A fight we'll never win, and time again we try" -Cosmic.
🖤 nunca mueran.🇬🇹 we love you.

The dancing part is my fav
There you find me...
I like how you have high-octave and mid-octave vocals layered on separate tracks, and with an interesting guitar melody, this certainly reaches deep into the heart and doesn't let go once it has a hold.  You guys mind if I borrow this for a video intro?  I'll credit you, of course.
My forever and always ❤
Cosmic 🔥
Advice: don't take LSD before watching this video
Lets gooo, happy this song got a video.
this is the “Exist” of the new album！
even better than the official visualizer😅
This is a very nice birthday present. I think LIBAD might be my favorite album of all time. A year ago the only Sevenfold i listened to was Shepherd of Fire because it was on Origins
My favourite song from LIBAD Album. Thank you, A7X, terima kasih A7X..
Thank you A7X for the many great Albums and Singles. 🎸🤘
Cosmic
Likes are more than the views...
Amazing song. Amazing Video. Great Vibes. Avenged Sevenfold will alway be my go to band. They just get better as they age :D
Why they doesn't appear in music videos anymore?
My goosebumps have goosebumps...
Picturing Death as Rev guiding us

Syns solos on this are so blistering....Cant wait to hear it live Thursday at Mohegan Sun..

Acid trip 2024 🤘🏼
Mr Skeletal has finally found peace 🥺
This is so fucking good!! The visual were insane!   Is it bad that i watched it 4 times in the first 50 minutes that the video has been out??!   @Avenged Sevenfold, keep bringing the fucking heat! 🔥
This song sounds so beautiful, for the ones that will never be forgotten
❤❤❤
Whenever you feel stupid, just remember there are people who haven't listened to this band since Waking the Fallen
Wow dope video! Waiting for the last piece of sand to drop to see what's after. Cosmic
💝
Lyrics:  Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
To heaven my Angel Emmanuel FOREVER ❤️🎸🌟✨💫💖 your favorite band ❤ on your first aniversary❤😓🎸🌟✨💫❤️❤️❤️ I loved ❣️
This is how I imagined a real music video of this song to be like.Well done A7X
There is something ethereal  sewn into this song and the video is literally how I feel when listening to this absolute masterpiece. Very happy to own this on vinyl. R.I.P. to The Rev, Jimmy can be felt in this one, even if he isn't here with us, we know he helped write this one.
By far, this is the best band of the world. No one can do what this band did. Avenged Sevenfold is a masterpiece making machine.
Best song of all time
Im seeing these mfs TONIGHT
Help me! I can't stop repeat~
Best song on the album! 💗💗💗
We waiting to Come in Indonesia 🇲🇨 🤟
Melhor música do A7X! Perfeita!
My favorite part is the segment with the skeleton dancing in the beach, because is the part you can really connect to (chilling in the beach in a beautiful sunset). The rest of the imagery if pretty cool but you can´t really go around the universe watching supernovas and so, so they "just" look cool
First from jakarta
I’m crying
There are no words to express how beautiful and magnificent this song is, honestly in my 25 years of life, it is one of the best I have heard, felt and lived in my life, thank you A7X 💫❤️🪐✨🥀
Every single time I hear this song I can't help my self to tear up, this song is beautiful
To apaixonada❤😍😍🇨🇦🇧🇷
always healthy success for AVENGED SEVENFOLD, their music is always cool and easy to listen to, it's not surprising that there are so many fans.....
I think im going to dust of my DMT pipe next week and watch this vid.  The whole album gives me a : sitting in a waiting room in the afterlife vibe. I'm curious how it will turn out
Witnessing a masterpiece just released 😊
gaahhd daym, just like what I imagine when I listen to it (not that cheesy tho lol)
Hail Brazil 🇧🇷
gracias por sacar la mejor cancion de todos los tiempos y por sacar la cancion que salvó a ese horrible album
This is artistry in its highest form.
before 1000 comment's
I can listen to this song the whole day without getting bored. Thanks to A7X for creating a masterpiece. ❤
They have such a collection of songs that make me feel and think all kinds of emotions, but this song here has absolutely taken the number one spot in my heart. This song makes my soul feel so much, every part of this song is an absolute masterpiece. The Ending is so blissful when it comes back in from the spacey comic sound break. When it comes back in it's like an explosion of emotion in this song. so Beautiful ❤️
Stupendo! 😮
Such a Nice trip. :)
Why do they no longer make music videos with the actual band members in it?
Best song of LIBAD
The wait was definitely worth it🔥🔥🔥🔥
<3
3:17 queria que essa dança fosse mais longa! 🥹
A melhor música do álbum ❤
I miss a7x by indonesia🇮🇩
Yesss
I LOVE YOU BOYS ❤ PERFECT VIDEO❤ BRASIL ❤
when i think about the vast existence if the galaxies, and how tiny we are, i think of this song.
Música Nova na Área. O solo de guitarra ficou show.
Finally! Thank you so much for this awesome song!
YAY NEW A7X DROP‼️‼️
This song makes me hopeful about something that’s not there. But hopeful
Oh my goood, i'm gonna cry
Fortnite cinematic lookin ahh
God I love this song so damn much
OBRIGADO POR ASSISTIR AVENGED 🇧🇷🖤
Hi
Beautiful, the way it should be.
Só Deus sabe o quanto estou ansiosa pra ver eles ao vivo aaaaafffff
My favorite part is when the hourglass gets flipped at the end. ❤❤
Beautiful
wow.... just wow.... one of the best songs avenged sevenfold ever produced....  Truly a masterpiece !!!❣
A masterpiece. You guys are amazing ❤
Man, that skeleton dancing really made me emotional. This was the last song I listened with my mom before cancer took her. And she always danced in a similar manner to get a funny reaction from our dog. This song, and now the video, will always hold a special place in my heart. Thank you
I love it 😍🩷
Oi meus lindos
this.. this is ART
Why the fuck did this make me cry
Great video!! Thank you as always avenged sevenfold! Idk how id make it through life without your music
The stage vibes
Nah cuse this is the most A7x thing ever
De lo mejor que se ha lanzado este año, preciosa obra maestra
Waaawww,,, Amazing 😎👍👍
The best solo from Gates ever!
The DRUM. Jesus so beautiful.
I remember waiting for the Hail to the king album to come out with my dad almost 10 years ago. One of, if not my favorite album of theirs due to the memories I created and times I shared with family and friends. Which leads me to now, 19 in October and growing up without my dad to see. He died 4 years ago but I can still see him struggling to breathe on life support.   Thank you A7X for carrying me through some of the darkest times i had to deal with.
finally, i love this..
LETS GOOOOOO
Best song in years!
Beautiful song. Easily the best one they've done in years. Any ideas on the meaning behind it?
Io vi amo ragazzi❤
We love you Avenged Sevenfold ❤
With a video like that, I wish I understood lyrics when people sang.
Bored
Stunning, absolutely stunning! Amazing music video for an amazing song!! 💯🔥🌌
Epic stuff
Keren banget anjir
Yang orang indo kumpul 🥰😍😎😘
That's ART. Period.
This song literally dedicated to Jimmy the Rev Sullivan..gone but not forgotten..foREVer in our heart❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ We all miss you Jimmy!!!!wish you were here and still with us..
Ooooooh COSMIC VINGANDO BURIED ALIVE!!! I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH!!! COME TO BRASIL!!!!
Congratulations!
Dude i dont get the hype for this song, dont get me wrong i love avenged sevenfold but no matter how much i lieten to this song i cant seem to get why people put this above the rest of their discography, it just doesnt make sense to me and im not trying to be different or ragebait but i genuinely want to understand what it is about this song that makes it so great to everyone else.
Nice to see that he finally gets his day off. Even if it means flying through the cosmos
@3:08    Im thinking a lot about the quote  'We are made of Stardust,' I feel like I'm chasing the brightness of the stars like ghosts in the sky, because their light is so distant with my feet here under gravity , on the ground, on this pale blue dot , but A7X brings me so closer to them 💫❤😸 beuty just moves on
Saudações do Rio Grande do Sul. O melhor estado do Brasil.
😭😭😭😭
first time i heard it I was like, "meeh", but just like the whole album, every time I watch it gets better and better, this gave me 7 minutes of being in total peace. What a masterpiece
It is literally impossible not to smile at 3:06
There are no words to describe this wonder
Ketinggalan 30 menit
Finally a song that actually deserves a music video.
When I got my deathbat tattoo people said it will not age well. A7X is the only band that outdo themselves album after album! Love you guys, amazing song.
Cara, que perfeição... Vou tatuar entre a cena 6:52 a 7:00
GOD BLESS A7X foREVer🙏
They will never make a heavy album again, like Hail To The King, Nightmare.
Love this !
Come to Brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
The video makes the song even better..
Cosmic is this album... from another world... <3
What kind of drugs do you need to enjoy this?
Rock and roll yall.Its good to hear an old voice ,
To heaven my Angel Emmanuel FOREVER ❤🎸⭐💫💖  your favorite band ❤  on your first aniversary ❤😓🎸⭐💫❤❤❤
Le metal a encore de l’espoir d’être original ! 🪐✨
Cosmic is a life changing piece of art and I will forever stand by that.
Amazing ✨️
O destino começou novamente uma luta que nós nunca ganharemos E, outra vez, nós tentamos Abandonado, não posso esperar muito tempo, desaparece  Amor, nós amamos tantas vezes E em tantas vidas, algumas vezes nós acertamos Dor, ela achou o caminho de volta Até nos encontrarmos de novo naquela boa noite....  Música absurda, impactante vai na alma.
This is masterpiece 🫡
Love it!!!
24 hour waiting Nothing special for me but good
The beat was bit faster than the original, but I think it sounds more interesting
This song is a life changer. Thanks , A7X
6:19 ¿Una referencia a Pink Floyd?.
I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nice from Indonesian
ta escutando muito pink meu mano shadows
looks like a drug induced dream
I am not getting tired of crying over this song. So much meaning and feelings in those melodies. Congrats, guys
Man i love avenged sevenfold
This song makes me cry 😔❤
Soo good, you guys knew what you were doing here and it shows!
Whenever I listened to this song I felt like it has a connection with The Rev somehow.....Share me how you guys interpreted this song
Thankyou🥰
Best song on the album
❤
What thing had the skeleton smoke ?
Masterpiece!!
And the Avenged sevenfold is back
Wahhhhh ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cool and it premiered on my birthday 😊
Good song good clip 🤩🤩🤩
5:22 eu transcendi junto com a caveirinha!
Lagu bagus menyala abangku!
Sometimes we’ve got it right
FOI ISSO QUE EU IMAGINEI SIM!!!!!! 😭 obrigada avenged amo vocês
I only wish that the eras in which we can find him were better represented. The lyrics speak a clear message of the dead not truly being gone for they can be found in history, made of the same elements that formed prior beauty (and beauty to come), but the video glosses over this a bit?
EXATAMENTE O QUE EU IMAGINAVA QUANDO EU OUVIA A MÚSICA, A PRAIA, AS CORES, AS ESTRELAS, TUDO!!!!!
COSMIC tan hermosa , especial e Importante para mí . Llegó en el momento justo en qué la necesitaba ❤.
Why this wasn't the last song on the album is beyond me.
Pertama dapet apa bang😂
very awesome
Masterpiece
Hellyeah!
best song ✋🏻✨️
Talk about a guitar solo that transcends space and time. Syn is UNREAL!!! Feels like im hurtling through space into my next life just like how the video depicts.

Best metal song in the past 10 years! Like if you agree!

I actually love this song 😀🖤
Agenved seventhfolded
Dis video di metaphysical reality of a acid trip
Fade from all there was before We shut another door, but not a last goodbye Fate has taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try Left alone I can't wait too long, fade  Love, love so many times And in so many lives Sometimes we got it right Pain, it found it's way back in Until we meet again, into that good night None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I'll follow you  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me, let it go Yeah, rings of dust and ice Weightless in the night There you'll find me, let it go  Dancing in the wind as roses born again There you'll find me, before the dawn of man In castles made of sand There you'll find me, writing in the caves As fire lights the way There you'll find me, mask of royal glow Done in pharaoh's clothes There you'll find me  From all that was before We shut another door But not a last goodbye Taken once again A fight we'll never win And time again we try We loved so many times (I'm gone) And in so many lives (I'm gone) Sometimes we got it right It found it's way back in (I'm gone) Until we meet again (I'm gone) Into that good
we waitited for a entire day and i was hoping for a deluxe verson of libad but we get a video. disapointment...

this is close to what i imagine every time listening to cosmic. it's bittersweet, hopeful, beautiful yet painful journey, it's also enlightening  i think the animation did a great job for the imagery. love it
This might be the single most complete musical piece that this group has ever done. I’m in absolute awe…
First day!
LETS GO BABY , A7X
MASTERPIECE
Im actually hoping they drop some cool colorful merch with this
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
aaaaaaaaa por finnnn 😭😭
When you mature and start to reflect on life, who we are and where we came from and where we are going, this song makes a lot of sense. Will the entire cycle of life repeat itself one day in another time? We will never know, but it is so wonderful just to imagine...
This is the best music video ever
I love this song🔥🔥
Can someone share their interpretation of the video?
No final ele tinha que ter ido buscar o personagem de "NO BODY". 👎🏻🥺😔
❤❤❤
Another cartoon?! I miss the old videos
They never disappoint! Love the new album 💀🖤
Absolutely breathtakingly, mesmerisingly, astonishingly magic! A7X forever🖤
Super cool! Keep up the amazing work :)

Bro all i’ve pictured was someone fought with their gf, she takes off and she ends up dying in a crash, hes an astronaut and a wormhole takes him back in time enough to try to stop her car from moving 1 inch. Someone has to make that version bro!
Why the shit music videos lately?
❤️❤️❤️🫶
Ai sim! Precisamos de ordinary também!  Obs: VEM LOGO PRO BRASIL ( RJ )
Best of the best 🔥🔥🔥 A masterpiece made out from a different dimension 🌌
Yess! I had a feeling it will be a music video. Beautiful vision of transition after death, when our self cleans till the last particle and we become one with the world or God or universe. But we still have some time left here :)
Hello ❤
que musica fantástica.
Hoping for a b-side of the whole album soon, would be amazing to see

MURUP MASKU 🔥🔥🔥
Hate always finds its way back in but you guys always know how to balance it, thank you 🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽
Tho I've loved everything you've ever done as a life long, die hard fan, this has made the journey of being a A7X fan absolutely priceless. Not many bands release this level of artistry in the mainstream with this level of emotion and mature song writing. I've never been more proud to be a A7X fan when we have such a heavenly soul-moving song like this 🤘 I can't explain how this one makes me feel, I just know it's you're greatest achievement yet and we thank you!! #foREVer
The best song of the album needed a video, you did again guys, thank so much...
🔥🔥🔥
the rev would be proud
MENYALA ABANGKUH🤘🔥
As roses born again 🌹
Exactly what my mind imagined when the badass drumbeat comes in, trippy flight through stars in warp speed. Cool how parts of this video already is what i invisioned subconsciously.
easily the best song on LIBAD, what a masterpiece!
M shadows best vocalist ever
This was awesome, I absolutely loved this. Feels like they wanted to craft something specific for Cosmic, and they took some inspiration from the Nobody music video.
They’re levels to this game and Avenged just keep getting better.
This song is nothing less of a masterpiece
what the REV?.. nonsense.. 😂😂
Well Done
Indonesia🇮🇩 hadir derrrr  Menyala bang avenged 🔥
My 30y birthday gift 🎉! Thank you guys ! ❤
A espera valeu a pena ❤
See you in Indonesia

Wooow the best song ❤️❤️
Hopefully this will help the song get the recognition it deserves. A masterpiece. 🪐💀🌌
Brazil please
A7x is back !🧡♥🖤
The song is still too good, now the part of the video... It's still the same as the media stuff they've been handing out to the fans, shit
F-ing Masterpiece !!!! 🔥🔥🔥 We only got one … Don’t let it go to waste !!!!  A wise man once said  “Life it’s to shot … and it’s not that serious “
I used to think avenged sevenfold is the best band ever exist
o melhor clip, quase chore i
okay no one's gonna mention that the premiere had this play twice? WHY TWICE WHAT ARE WE MISSING??
Seriously, if theres someone out there whos not smoked DMT or eaten MDMA in a safe and loving environment surrounded by people who love you... It do be like that. RIP silk road
This song will foREVer put me in my feels. 🌌
When syn said that the cosmic solo was his favorite solo he was absolutely right.❤️🦇
🫡🫡🫡
Amazing visuals and more amazing music! Synyster gates guitar is crazyyyyyy
See you in jakarta!!!!
Was here through the stream and tbh I’m not surprised it’s another stop motion video, don’t get me wrong I love the video but the hype seemed abit too much, I thought we were in for a Deluxe Version of LIBAD? Guessed Wrong 😅
And I thought the music video to Nobody was trippy as fuck.
Lets be real, video is great, but we def wanted a deluxe album more than this. Especially when all fingers pointed to that being the case when the stream was released
This is the best song on the album and in my opinion one of the best songs from a7x
Dancing in front of the star might be my new tattoo
Thank you guys so much for this song/video. Hope to see ya again soon, peace ✌️
incredible
Come to Brazil 🥺🥺🇧🇷🇧🇷

the rev, i hope you are still beside them and singing this masterpiece.

“None too far as we chase through the stars beyond forever I’ll follow you”  These lyrics have always stuck with me for some reason. What’s your interpretation of what it means?
There you'll find me
WE LOVE YOU GUYS! 🦇💖

We love you is my fav from this album, but Cosmic is a close second

Terrible music video for one of their best songs in their new album. This feels so lazy and uninspired for such an ambitious song. 😮‍💨
Cosmic is so majestic ⭐️
The best song in the world! 😍😍😍

Perfect video for a perfect song!!!
Nice. Probably my favourite off of the new album.
YES FINALLY 🎉🎉🎉
Starting listening to metal when I was 11 years old because of this band. My brother was struggling with a heroin addiction at the time of Nightmares release until his passing. That was the first record I listened to. Rev had died very young, and just 2 years ago my brother passed at 27 from his addiction. This band has been with me through every major step in my life and this song helped me so much to recover. Thank you so much for all you do.  (Edit) thought rev was 27. My mistake.
It's soooo magical this video,better than 80% of Disney movies nowaday...even the rainbow,the colours,the space,everything...thanks A7X to make magic this time,it's okay to stop making the same metal for a moment,but what we are waiting for next album is a good good one...with this type of metal with the old A7X...progressive and haavy metal,it's a good combination...heavy and calm metal moments will come out!
Massive wait just for a music video? What a joke
This is for R.E.V! From all of us 🖤🤍
🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺
Until we meet again...
❤❤❤
❤❤
I was here
👏👏👏👏👏
IT WAS AWESOME ❤
Amazing!
This song is perfection. So happy they did this. 🥲💛
Oh shit!!!
not to be a dick, but maybe releasing a music video for a song that came out over half a year ago wasnt very smart, especially since im just gonna watch the music video once, then go back to the album version lol
Watched it live was amazing ❤❤
another flying skeleton, just wow.
disappointing
Indonesia hadir avenged hadir di bulan mei
Flying across the country to see them in Newark, can’t wait to hear this and save me and everything else of course
EXACTLY HOW I IMAGINED THIS SONG! THE COLOR AND VIBES! FANTASTIC!!!!!
Ugh, that was beautiful. Favorite new song of theirs, best video they've put out in quite a while now. Gorgeous all around. A7X forREVer

Let's gooo
Suco do metal🤘🏻🙂‍↕️🙂‍↔️
Awesome! I love stop motion, and when you combine it with the best band ever, it's chocolate and peanut butter!
Idk how to describe it.. but this was my exact interpretation of this song, perfectly embodied in a music video.
Awebooo
🇧🇷🖤
Seeing this live was so cool
Indonesia 🥰🤜🏼🤛🏽
I love cosmic best song on LIBAD
Until we meet again.
please play in new york from august 16 to august 26 please
The reason you're confused by the lyrics is because you are looking at  it through the lens of romance. This song is about 2 souls finding each other throughout eternity and waiting to meet again in another life and beyond
Had a countdown for a lazy music video🤣 great song but wtf
I need something like Nightmare
Another stop motion, on an arguably the best song in the album. Love it! ❤
greatest music video in a7x history wow
My favorite band and my 2023/2024 favorite song ❤❤❤
