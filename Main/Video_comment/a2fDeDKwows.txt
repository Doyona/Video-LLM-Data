Hey guys ive noticed a mistake in editing 😅 Late nights editing take a toll on you... I guess thats what makes Youtube Youtube though! We all human 🤟
Brilliant build, loved everything about it🤔 except those rims bro, but if you like them good on you. Second time watching this build series,  it was so enjoyable. Cheers from the Caribbean.
Dear friend, you have a lousy taste to choose the color of the cars and especially the tires
Omg
I would have had to clean everything on the body before putting the panels on
Saludos desde puebla México megusta ver tus videos  ....
The carbon and the color... A huge mismatch.
Matty, it looks like a car you would see in the movie "TRON". As always, stellar vision. You transform trash into absolute treasure. Fantastic work!!!!!
Matt Armstrong 💪. Said it once ill say it again. " you're the Man".. really enjoy watching... keep it up...🫡👍
Nothing about this car is normal .but hey it is special
I like the wheels bro
Sorry, Really don't like the wheels.... unbelievable job on the rebuild.
Yea don’t like the rims, look to tiny with the white frisbees on them.
Well rims should had match the color of the car... come on mat....
Mat... I love you but that color is shit..  cherry red with carbon fiber would be 1000% better
Ese coche es una verdadera joya..!🤩
20:28
With all respect. I’m addicted to you channel your the greatest but… are you colorblind? That mintblue ?? With black orange interior?? Really…
Nice kolor
You’re a genius. Loved watching all four videos. Hope the oil burns out of the engine soon!
Proof that long-form content can retain viewers, if the topic and presentation is appealing to a specific target audience.  Strangely compelling for someone who is not a car guy. Personally though i don’t think hawking nutritional drinks adds to the brand - just my opinion having worked in digital marketing.
LAS RUEDAS COMBINAN MUY BIEN CON LA CARROCERIA
excelente trabajo  abrazo desde ARGENTINA
It's a beautiful car!  Outstanding video, guys!
eres el mejor espere poder participar en uno de us provyectis sube mas videos  uqe ya los vi todos
You did a great job kudos❤❤❤❤.
I love your dad’s one liners. 😂
The cost of the Y Foods in the 😊 is very expensive..
It is quite normal to simply add a thin layer of self levelling compound on top of a rough concrete surface to give a nice smooth finish. Alternatively use a larger concrete grinder,  similar in operation to a helicopter. And  please, stop beating up on yourself.
No había otro color más feo que ese ?
I’m a new subscriber and I’m trying to watch as much content as I can but these rims (Wheels) are looking insanely good
Congrats Mat, what a job…curious to see what happened to the engine. The car is also soooooo looooow…..every driveway will be challenge even if the front does lift up a bit
Eres un dios de los autos chocados les das otro oportunidad de vida yo tengo un jaguar de mi padre lo estoy reparando lo queria mucho el 2003
And your Dad Tony is a LEGEND also
Congratulations Mat an absolute beauty of a 720s. It's true and you just prove it hard work pays off and you can do anything you put your mind to. The rebuild of that car shows exactly that. So THANK YOU MAT for showing that fact
18:03 Appreciated that you try it for the germans but the correct word in german would be "Motorhaube". :D
Hey Matt love the content but could you do part 1 part 2 etc the McLaren I watched in totally wrong order
so I think the word you used for the bonnet was incorrect In German can you spell this for us
when did it go back to steering on the left?
Absolutely amazing build with amazing skills but them bloody wheels just ruined it all 😢
nonono.... im just shaking my head on the wheels......really sorry. but the whole thing is just insane..... amazing work
Always laughing in the face of adversity...the English way. That deserves respect, guys.
I love the mclaren
Você qe reforma meu carro
Voce que reformar meu carro e um cosa
Omg, what a horrible wheels my friend😂
En serio.. que mal gusto tienen para las llantas... 😂😂😂
I Am mexican❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
HELLO MATE ,YOU KEEP ON BUYING WRECKED,DANAGE,FLOOD HYPERCARS DOES IT WORTH ? OR LOSSING MONEY
01:45 more happier? That’s redundant. You can be more happy or you can be happier. You can’t be more happier. Basic grammar.
16:19 16:19 16:19
Bro i love this channel i just found it about a week ago. Also I think its great that you and your father get to make videos together and even more about killer cars!👍
Ibiukora bituma natwe tudacikinege.
🖖Well done
Antes amaba lamborghini pero cuando conocí  el mclaren 😮 fue un flechazo ❤ sobre todo el mclaren 720s
I like the car appreciate and understand the effort , HOWEVER body color yuk , wheels double yuk .
Genial saludos desde colombian😊
lol proper thought i had more than 1 vid playing then checking all my tabs haha dont worry about it though all adds to the personal flavour of your AWSOME channnneeelllll  - and remember SEND IT love you guys
Yuk, it’s horrible, that color😢
r   enn sick
Awsome👍🏻👍🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
I actually don't think the weels are that bad but it could be a bit better Matt
Thank you for supporting my favourite flavour of y food
I love the McLaren! She is a beautiful machine! ❤❤❤❤
Nice channel Matt, I enjoy it very much, however what an awfully colour for the McLaren!!!
Those rims are ugly
Ojala algun dia tega algo firmado tullo  Saudos desde mexico ❤
Nice video and car.. just wish you would stop ramming car vertical and your other sponsors down people's throat
The colour Yuk, and those wheels yuk.  what was the fire?
Thats not a colour , totally wrong. looks so Korean toy car.
How the hell do u know how to put all these things back together mate? Like the wiring etc? How do u know how? It's amazing
Quite an achievement!
bad color bro
Looks like a dream car to me
ole Pirtek enjoying the free advertisement.
Just watched the series of this build, looks awesome great job. I'm really enjoying the channel.
Back in the day, whitewalls were a big thing, they look great
I must say I’m amazed what you and your dad can do i can’t praise you high enough but your colour choices are horrendous and this one has ruined all the hard work you have done
If a category B car can’t go back on the road, how do you lift that restriction post repair so it can be legally used in the road UK
Don’t care for the wheels.
Hi i like mclaren and driving empire
Build your car and enjoy it Matt.
What a conquest getting that car back on the road. Truly a tech rubics cube pulling that off.  But…gotta lose those wheels ;-)
Saludos mat el capi
Mat 👊👊👊👊👊👊👍👍👍👍👍👍
Soy el capi
The Lenovo T420 is a goated choice for A technician Laptop
Te quedó chingon amigo ese color está bonito parecía inpocible pero con mucho esfuerzo quedó bien
Mate are you colour blind mint and orange !!!!! Work fantastic your a magician but the colours
colour should have been mat grey, this is horrific imo
wow es maravilloso el más bonito de todos.
Sorry Matt, the car looks immense, but the wheels totally ruin it, they are God damb awfull
Don't like the colour. Metallic orange would have looked better. The diffuser is too big. Apart from that, great job.
I don't know why, but I keep watching these old vids whenever I'm bored.
Love the color 😮😮😮😮 what a make over
just wow
those wheels suck
Roda feia, a preta anterior estava bem melhor.
Such an awemose car Mat. Love your videos.
Whole car is just amazing
Awesome...
Those wheels are perfect mate😁and that color too😁
That carbon looks so fresh
Mat I love your videos
I love how the dad always has a smile on his face!
2
stunning colour but my first thought regarding the rims  was LEGO. Your enthusiasm however is always a pleasure to follow.
Hey, you should have a signature sticker ( Mark Armstrong ) on each car you build.
Still the best build
Me encanta tu auto
Todobien
Hola
20:27 lollllllllllllllll
Your pops is so dope😂
Wat is that first instrument💯💯
The white wall wheels are the let down  Otherwise, amazing build
Los rines no le quedan para nada a ese auto
Son geniales me encantan sus videos 😊🎉
Those rims so hard!!
Messi or Ronaldo?👇
A mi me gustan sus vídeos y forma que arreglan eso autos
Behind a successful man always have a successful woman 😊
para mi gusto es demasiado carbono... al diseño anterior era mas lindo!!!! saludos
Great job, Mat and crew!  Im impressed with your and your dad's talents.  I love the show! I would like to start something like this.
Wheels are ugly. I'm that 50%
I love love love this channel mat ur great guy mate
I love the rims but the white part should be color match the car color
Every man's favorite flavor...
'Really don't like the wheels but having said that, when I build my McLaren, you're welcome not to like my choice. This is another absolutely brilliant vid' and you're right to build the car that YOU want to drive. Massive respect to you and the team. 'Love it. :)
His dad knows how important he is to this channel. He's almost become the MA Jedi master that the others turn to for ideas.
You do a fantastic job
no creo que la ganancia este en promocionar is food
no le encuentro la lógica de reparar los autos y quedarse con ellos, si la ganancia de repararlos esta en venderlos y seguir comprando y seguir reparando es como una tendencia, entre mas reparas mas vendes y mas ganancia tienes, pero quedarse con ellos, no veo donde esta la ganancia
ese color esta feo para un auto deportivo
Love it😊😊
Sick😂
I wouldn’t sell it
u r much better on script, i would tone done the silly laughter ATT, think about your next 4 mil subs, just 1 opinion.  Keep it up.
imagine at 6:55 you were hired to put a glass on a car while hearing it costs 1400 pounds, id be under so much pressure😬
Love the body kit
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🔥
It’s just hmm well I’m  speechless … it’s the goat 🐐❤️⭐️❤️
Can you do next tesla model Y plis😊. I want you to do this for soo long! Can you pkis do it for me! Im am you're the best fan!!!❤
How come you didn't set it on fire like you said?
I like the wheels the only thing I would suggest is doing the white rim the same blue as the car it would pop then I think but its your car mate
I disagree the Mclaren looks nice but to me the ferrari or the c63 is alot nicer
Brilliant video  Matt  don't like the wheels
Hello Mat, would you consider do a normal car?
And if you're in australia instead of win it is mudguard, and instead of hood it is bonnet, fun fact
McLaren make such a beautiful piece of machinery!!!
Awful bathroom suite colour. Matching orange with the orange parts of the interior would have been far far far far better.
I would recommend the white part of the wheels to be turned into carbon fiber. Amazing video though! Huge fan here bro!
Ruined it with the ugly rims🥲
The car and color are beautiful but my lord the wheels are ugly as anything! I'm a big fan of all your builds but damn these wheels ruined this car for me. JMO
OK   I spoke too soon---its looking better
Beauty is truly in the eyes of the beholder---TOTALY FUCKED UP THAT BEUTIFUL CAR WITH THAT COLOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I didn't love your channel so much I would unsubscribe over that color  --- ROFL   😎😎😎😎😎
Sei veramende ingamba 👍
That’s a shame, those wheels look naff - the original ones looked SO good - when you pulled into Wheel Mania it looked AMAZING. But it’s your car and your choice and that’s what counts - congratulations.
21:08 and dya know what else is massive? 💈💇🏻‍♂️
This is a great series. But the colour 🤮. The original colour was miles better.
white trimming on the wheel don't go with rest of the look and color. but rest turned out amazing
🤡🤡🤡at end
Amazing done it...shout out fr..austria👊👍🎄🇦🇹
The wheels look good
where do you live
so you fixed the MCkaren :)
Awesome build! It looks absolutely mint... except the rims. Best channel on YouTube! Fact!
wheels not looking good. sorry bro
Wow everything gets checked on a car to import safe for the uk roads yet uk roads aren’t safe at all for the cars
Hey Mat been a subscriber for a while and I have no shame in asking begging to have that McLaren but my dream ultimate car is Aston Martin DB9
The white trim on the rims does not go with the car it's better all black
Bro yo car is so sick I love it so much 🎉❤
Bro yo car is so sick I love it so much 🎉❤
What happened with the engine ? Skirted over that …
W
Ami no me gustaron las ruedas
Love the car the colour is amazing really pops well and the wheels are a win to me, well done nailed it like always
Didnt know about carbon fiber but in the car looks bad as hell
at first i didnt like it but after thinking about all super cars are crazy colors so love it now
To be honest the spare wheels looks good on that than the after ones still looks good
Que bonito es Chiapas
The wheels look like NODDYS 😂
Those red with black wheels on the wall behind matt would look FIRE cus then it looks like ur wheels are on fire cus it is fir❤ could you try those wheels
In German bonnet is Not Deckel ist Motorhaube Deckel means cap
Love your work Mat keep the videos rolling. I hope you had words with the guy you bought the 'new second hand' shocker struts for 1700 pounds each when you bought the' new new' ones for 1300 pounds each. Lol😂
The exhaust went from 7k to 9k then finally 14k LOL...this show is so fictional its not even funny....
Dude this is crazy, u guys rule
Wheels killed the build, i guess some people dont have taste..
Part of me loves the wheels and part of me hates it lol
It is done
👏👏👏👏
You just need to learn how to cut hair NOW !!!
It's exciting to watch your videos 😂😂😂❤❤❤lovin it
Looks really, one of a kind
Cool guy, you're DAD😊
I appreciate your keen eye. You're one  clever guy😊
YouTubers have developed 2 habits 1: Using Cringy Music  2: Taking Interest in Minors when they too big and famous  There are other habits too but for now pointing out 2 is enough
29:19 I love the wheels
what happened after the fire... whats the next video?
Bonnet or cófano  if you are Italian
18:04 yes i am german😂
If you ever have problems with sticky residue look for some orange smell sticky stuff remover it's awesome makes any stickers left overs turn to water consistency it's amazing stuff !!!
Bonnet in German = "Motorhaube" or only "Haube". German "Deckel" is more used for the filler cap or the trunk lid.   🙂
This is seriously impressive! The amount of work and skill gone into this is mind boggling
What a sick build
Im German, but wehre I am we say Motorhaube not Deckel. Deckel is on glass container😂
Are you British?
Cool
Wow..😅😂
How did you catch on fire?😮😮😮😮😮😮
sup
That was  a waste of time
Tbh this car has the face that I hate and it says "I will break every time you use me". I have seen that face and will see it on cars but man I hate it but you cant lose hope in the car it just doesn't let me even after 40k of repairs on a GTR. Anyways bro enjoy I hope the car loses that face I'm talking about 😂 Take Care of that beauty
At 4.17. That wasn't lego. It's a tap washer. From any hardware shop.
The wheel just ruin it mate 😢
Looks sooo sick😍who ceres what ppl think 👌🏼😂
Loving the videos Matt. Watched all of them 😂. Quick question, how did you get on jacking the car up? Iv heard you heave to be careful with carbon tubs. Iv heard if you jack up the McLaren slr from one corner things can go a cracking lol.
Personally I would have the wheels just without those white rim parts
Rebuilding a wrecked McLaren 720S only to have it catch fire is undoubtedly a harrowing experience that underscores the challenges and risks involved in automotive restoration projects, especially with high-performance vehicles.
You really are an artist with how you restore these wrecked cars.
It is so cool
It is very beautiful i wish i had it for my self
That guy in the background when he said that the windows were $3000 each 😂😂💀💀
21:02 looks like a Hennessey F5 defuser
I really enjoy watching you guys bring that car to its final setup!
Well done..love it..
I like it
Amazing work and fun to watch.  The wheels ruin the look of the car.    Otherwise the car looks amazing.
i love limited edition liquid
I love this guy buy I'm not sure about his colour taste...
Deckel just means lid...Motorhaube is the bonnet, or hood, if you're american ^^
Well done, Mat under  24h, you done it
just for info a car bonnet is called Motorhaube in German not deckel. love your vids keep them coming.
For the knowledge & Mostly the entertainment value ... I love this show !
29:13 Damn! Look at those tires dude Mat really does it the best, love it!!!
Yep those wheels look 💩
i like it mat
is there any where else than , copart you use ?
Does  any knows engine number location of 720s?
No danish
Sometimes Mat your color choices and combinations leave a bit to be desired but on this occasion you have nailed it...
I would are e absolutely loved that thing that didn't look like a space ship, and I was the caller, you know, my favorite color is blue. I just my first video just watching you and I don't even know you just surprise me.
I won't lie, your front wing louvers not actually being functional was kinda disheartening
This car Is a banger
guys lets get mat armstrong to 3m likes ♥️
Those wheels look awesome. Good choice mate..
God bless Honda
Wheels would look sick without those white thingies.
6,542nd.  Great progress Mat. Little by little it’s getting closer to you driving it on the street. Roger in Pierre South Dakota USA
love yalls videos regardless of if all the parts go on. keep making theses video's absolutely lovin it
worst wheels ive ever seen
Those rims ain’t suits car
Mc laren built quality alignment not good Porsche best
The ultimate in our trash culture.
I have 1 of those special edition bottles
The wheels are hideous which makes the car uniqueness
The white on the rims should of matched the blue
Way too much carbon in the front side fenders should have been the baby blue.
I can't stop watching.
I hate to be that guy but the rims just ruined it 😢
18:03 Actually it's "Motorhaube" in German.
Man those whells are like the Cherries on top 👌
nice cAR
car looks like something out of Tron! WOW
blessings king Glory to the lord
"I couldn't be any more happier!" - that's right, you couldn't. Because you could only be more happy.
oem wheels way better  2 colours work 3 don't..
Why those wheels mat
Ples take it too sema
Then it set on fire, really, did it set on fire?
I like the bead locks.
Bouw oh waher😂❤️
white rings on the wheels was a bad decision
You both are so lucky to have each other. I have watched so many of your vlogs.  It's obvious to me that you both have the same hearts. Very loving and giving. Also, you work well together as a team. Your girlfriend loves you and appreciates you. Never discourage her from showing you affection.  Also, never stop showing her love and respect.  You guys will have an awesome life. God bless both of you. Never let anyone come between you both. Jealous people will always try to come between you. Misery loves. Company.
Looks like something from GTA Online lobby
Looks like the inbetweeners car
You have a McLaren and you put those wheels on it!! Why why why
"And it runs perfectly with no issues whatsoever"🤔🤔 hmmmmmmm🤔🤔🤔 i'll take ur word for it matt
What a letdown on the colour. VILE! And the wheels are awful, just like push wheel covers.
Well done Mat and team. So cool to see this build
i actually have 0 dollars in the Bank seeing this blows my mind i will get there just like you did it looks absolutely insane
At first I was impressed by the jobs you took on in a garage with a 24/7 smile.  After watching the MaClaren build I am convinced you aren’t human ?! You just jump in and your off the cuff comments make you sound like you are learning as you go. By now you are not only a mechanic but an outstanding one at that. Anyone I’ve known in the automotive business would have run from that car… you still completed a car that the manufacturer said was not repairable … I’m not worthy lol you are a hoot with certified brass
German: Deckel means lid and Haube means hood / bonnet.
Wheels are great except the white looks weird, they should be mint also
P1 MClaren spyder build. Hi Matt the guy at The Car Council on YouTube need a windscreen surround for their P1 spyder build. Can your old tube help them out. These guys are mad into modified MClarens.
Stunning looking car,wonder how much it’s worth now with rebuild
Wow it is matching
You are amazing mate, just recently come across you and I can’t believe how good this channel is. Awesome work with the McLaren mate, I can’t imagine how much time and effort it do everything you’ve done 👌🏼 much love 🤙🏼
The 720 looks really easy to work on compared to other cars
It's not "Deckel" it's called "Motorhaube". What you call "trunk lid" we call "Kofferraumdeckel" there you got your "deckel" mate 😁 just wanted to spread some unnecessary information and say keep up the one of a kind content! Big up mate! Love from germany
Nope to that colour. Like Henry Ford said: “You can get the car in any colour you want as long as it is black. “
lost me on the ugly fake vents
NOTE: Swap out the white panels on the wheels with sleek exposed fiber ones and your car will be ready to turn heads. The white panels just don't do justice to the overall aesthetic of the vehicle!
Fantastic, If I wasn't subscribed I would subscribe!
Matthew These supercar companies need to have you to pick the colors. You really have an eye for color. Absolutely Love these colors
100
Love the wheels....gives something personal and with the color of the car .....superb .... have fun with it
There's a shop that you can get body parts online
The wheels make it look too futuristic for me 🤔
Nice build but that color is atrocious and so are the rims imo.
18:00 it is called a Motorhaube not a Deckel in German.
when rebuilding like this were do people purchase the bodyparts
I’m an idiot. Tell me why at 19:00 I was watching you put on the fenders, hood and front number, thinking you still have to put the engine in, under the hood? 😂 what a dumb ass I am. 😅
@Jimmy_Broadbent would be so proud of your very own MINTY!!!!!
Boss
Nice white wall wheels 😂, What was engine issue? Benj, Johannesburg, South Africa 🇿🇦
That car is most amazing and aggressive 😅 congrats!
Even the Mclaren doesn't like that wheels 😅
You are the best 👌
Bro respect for the the love you have with your dad ,Stay humble and stay blessed!!!
I actually like the wheels
Matt i have been following your channel because of my love for cars most especially fast cars. I am an African from Nigeria 🇳🇬 precisely,  and I would love to have a car like that it's my dream thing 😢😢😢
Matt u are so good building cars, but I have tbh, u have a very bad taste with wheels😅
The wheels just undo the entire build.
It's not "Deckel" if you are german. It's Haube or Motorhaube to be precise.
Your dad has such a small voice. Lol
This must be so satisfying when done it was just watching on YouTube
Where is the Spanish edition of maclaren series
24:34 “That looks menthol”  I agree, Mat 😄
Some Folks, Call the Wings / Fenders, Wheel Arch too I suppose.
the wheels are not one of a kind because stadman have it on is lomb
Baysclly you just build whole McLaren 720s
I love the rims except the white rings
INCREDIBLE ,DETERMINATION,ABILITY AND SELF BELIEF ...SO REFRESHING . (EX PAT LIVING IN BRAZIL) ENJOYING ALL YOUR VIDEOS ...THANKS AND WELL DONE
I would put an exoskeleton on it and make a McLaren version of Leroy
Love the colour and the overall look, apart from the wheels, which just don't seem to sync with the rest of the car.
I love the car
Noooooo hate the wheels
Same as Stradmans wheels
Holy sh**!!!!!!!!!! Mat, firstly thank you! I've never seen such feature length videos on car repairs on youtube before! This makes your videos so watchable! That car, can't even put into words how fantastic a job you've made of it. The colour/carbon complements/wheels just looks badass!!! I'm literally staring at the screen, jaw on the floor!!! Amazing!!! Well done!!!! How many nuts n bolts were residual in a coffee jar by the end? lol
Good 😮 Carr....
What is this black glue for additions?
Wheels bad
Great episode Mat 😊
fenders should have been blue(with carbon fibre gills) and wheels should have been white/metalic with a simpler design
Yeah the stock wheels were better. When the whole car is so ‘stand out’, the wheels being toned down a bit and sharp was the way to go I feel. Anyway, amazing work mate! 👍🏻
And then the Stig, bebble dashes it!
One pound is how much in dollars
Cool colour for the car but not really impressed with the wheels...Mat, I love your videos, literally found out about you yesterday and I'm already obsessed. I have already watched more then 10 videos...
🎉🎉🎉 The best car, the incredible colour the body kit wow surprising M.A
Omg , that car was unrepairable
Super Smart guys 😊
You can make a French channel pls Mat!🙏🏻🇲🇫
amazing job, but green... 😩
If this car is just passing through in Mexico and here they've been doing this for a month now, you denigrate Mexico or who is the one who uploads your videos dubbed in Spanish, this is even, I think
The colors through me but have to watch.  Good job, and your dad  is very cool. I had cancer surgery this week. Can I get your drink online? I am living in the USA, Arizona.  Awesome
y  la traduccccion al español
Las llantas me parecen una cagada amigo.
10/10
Your dad is so nice for him to love rebuilding cars with you
I no liked the color of the wheels
Woooow vi todo el proceso
🤗👍🤩💯🥇🏅🏆
Yeah
The wheels are honestly not bad at all actually, but the front carbon fenders does make the car looks somewhat unfinished in my opinion
It"s "Haube" in German actually
Rims does not look nice for this car
Mat in Germany we actually call it a Motorhaube which means enginehood
Love the color and all the carbon👍🏽. But the wheels I’m not digging it.
it`s not dekel ist Motorhaube )- :
Amazing video Mat, but the wheels and diffuser are horrible
I love your videos.
Quien mas viene del canal en español!!
Me half listening as I watch the video and work... Where is this link for a free waifu hahaha
Yo I love the channel and your videos but supporting yfood/nestle isn’t cool.
Most people would envy the cars that you’re building but for me it’s the smile your dad has and the support he gives with parts in hand. 10/10 dad   Lmfao My dad left for a pack of smokes while ago just left me with his passion of cars would be nice to have help like that
I wish I was rich enough to have this car
Bro has max weight reduction
I love your vids
Would you do another McLaren if the opportunity came by again?
hope u get a konengseg
Mat necesito un motor para mi carro ayudameeee😢😢😢😢😢
En español ?????
rolls royce rebuild?
It loks like a gta car, soooo nice
Wheels are horrid
What was the verdict on the brake light?
Guenial😊
The rims look sick
Anyone know what bodyshop Matt uses for his builds?
18:03 its not Deckel in German its Motorhaube :D
20:28 🤣🤣🤣🤣
hi
Love your videos, but….horrible colour and wheels😢
I could honestly watch this team forever ❤️
Mat I need help ordering parts for my jag 2005 thanks  I’m shit at diy  Danny
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘       cool         I           like        it
wonderful, my dear brother, you are truly a master craftsman that I appreciate. I'm working the same as you but for hyundai car company.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
the wheels..... noooooo they are gross
Wheels were horrible until they went on the car then they went together so well
German ist Motorhaube even tho there is no motor under it
This looks like a real life Tron light cycle car 🔥
thats awesome i'm learning to build cars now wish me luck Matt thanks to you i go for it
Mat, whats the music at 12:15? thanks!
Song at 12 min?
That huracan went like f**k, you could tell it was easier the faster lap.
If you’ve spent the money and time on the car then the colour and wheels are really nobody’s else business. However, the wheels do make it look a bit like the DeLorean from Back to the future III (when it’s had those white side wall wheels put on it)😂😂😂
mozart moonlight 3rd movement be cracking in the intro
Great build but those wheels are 🤮
to be honest the wheel design was not good at pick
Absolutely awsome journey I just how they brought it to mclaren to see if every electrical thingy is right 😂
Congrats on having your very own Waifu Mat.  Just don't tell your girlfriend.  That's what I do.
A McLaren? (Add brown color) PERRY THE MCLAREN?!!
Its not "Deckel", its "Motorhaube"
How the hell does he find so many second hand mclaren parts?? Like this cars are supposed to be rare
Las ruedas me encantan quedo genial !!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
nooo those rims ruined it
just found your channel and im curious if you sell most cars you rebuild or keep them for personal use?
Fantastic build......apart from shit wheels...!!!!!
Are there any more parts to this?
if they add a cocnut i might consider buying
you have actually smashed the youtube game, i remember watching you remap a 1 series on some country lanes :)
Can I for example buy a car from Copart to send it to another country here at my home or somewhere to my town ? I am not from AMERICA ,I am from EUROPE and I am asking if I can buy one car which I love to have it and after one month it will here at my country .
mate forget about the people complaining about the wheels, those look absolutely MENTAL! great job 👏
Dear Mat Armstrong, please dont die of carbon monoxide poisoning by leaving your car on in your garage.
You need to drive this to monaco fr 🗿
bro you are literally Los Santos customs irl😅😂
4 weeks later and no update on what the problem was common Mat don't keep us all waiting
Matt you are the mate I always wanted🤣
👌
I can’t order the special edition to Germany 😭
rims ruined it all
I hate the colour choice and wheels but i love them as well.
The wheels no man it looks like a Colgate ad
I feel sick,  not in a good way, minty green,  why??? Car companies carry on build cars you cannot work on their  cars, that way you have to pay them again to fix them, also you cannot buy the tools to do it yourself. You will soon find out deckel means lid in German lol It does look good finished,  but i still don't like like the minty green,  is it for your GF???
What was the problem with the white smoke at the end. Also not sure about the white walled 🛞. Just my opinion 😎
Need an update video Matt.
I love how Mat is comparing many langauges their car parts 18:00 But mostly in Germany we say: Haube.
this car is so good and nice
Piston rings maybe?
worst case this guy can help @tussik01. be a good collaboration :)
The wheels go so tough with the color and carbon kit
nice car aweful colour
Looks fantastic Mat!!!
I absolutely love how happy you both are in the videos
Car looks amazing! Well with the original wheels 😬
Guys, I've noticed this not for the first time: so, your car starts smoking. Why on earth do you keep pressing the gas pedal? It's clear that you're going to completely ruin the engine this way. You see smoke, turn off the ignition, and then figure it out. I really don't understand how you can't feel sorry for your own effort. You've spent a ton of time restoring it. Now you'll burn the engine, and then how much will it cost? 40,000?
Those wheels are disgusting 🤢 only time in any of your builds you've completely ruined the look of your car 😂
I thought u were saying waifu
I'm just hoping Mat doesn't get rid of this car
I would love to work with you. I would learn a lot and I would have so much fun with you. I love your videos keep it up ❤😊!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bro thats not from the accident, thats mclaren quality :D
I wish i was young again that i could do that, be careful of drinking those Banana drinks do not have too many as there is a lot of potassium in them and too much can be harmful ,thanks for the video
wheels looks good but fitment is a bit weak.. Could use a spacer in the back minimum
nah the GT3 is waaaaay better
There is such a thing as too much carbon, like the colour tho
What is it with something bad happening at wheel mania same thing happend with your Audi
The shell look kinda like the wheels on the Stradman pink wide body aventador
wind screen wind shield
Are there any update videos coming in regards to this beautiful Mclaren car of yours?
Throw some color matched tire stickers to the wrap color...would be the icing on the cake with your build
This car is amazing apart from the fire at the end , what's it worth now ?
That color is an absolute disgrace but good job lad
I think the main guy in this story is your dad he is definitely amazing❤.
I was like "these are the ugliest rims I ever saw, I hope he doesn't ... oh , he does" :D
형, 한글 번역 자막은 무리겠지? 😢
That colour is beautiful!
It‘s not Deckel in German say Motorhaube
Hi Mat. Love your content. What happened to the McLaren 720 after it broke?
Just started watching your videos and subscribed. Love the hell out of your channel. This build was too cool. Waiting to see what comes.
What was the issue with the smoke?
Wheels are absolutely incredibly grotesque!!!
How many cars do you own?
Don't like the wheel choice but great job rebuilding and mint color!
Hey Mat. Please will you refrain from using God's name as a cuss word. It is Blasphemy.
Hey Mat, just a word of advice as I’m an estimator in the body repair industry. I would see if you can get the procedures from BMW  for replacing those inner quarter components as sometimes they can have additional panels that have to be replaced even if undamaged (sacrificial panels) just depending on how they all intersect and interlock. Especially when you’re getting to that inner structure…. I know insurance wouldn’t try to repair that thing with a ten foot pole (for good reason) but if it  makes financial sense and you’re crazy enough to give it a shot I’m all for it!  Love the work you do mate
Your so underrated your vids are so entertaining and you build sick cars keep it up
Perfect build apart from the wheels imo
I hate that fault code "ENGINE VERY BAD"
Gotta say, no German I know calls it Deckel it‘s always Motorhaube 😅😂
hood in dutch is a motorkap or rough translation enginecap, i just wanna hear a british person say it haha. by the way love the vids they help me out i am subbing now. <3
I like it individually
The wheels are HORRENDUS, pls take them off.
Been my favorite YouTuber for so long. Gotta respect the hard work he puts in!
The engine started to fill because of those wheels. 😂 The engine was like get those damn ugly wheels off of me
The toothpaste McLaren
If you do not mind just letting me know what was the problem on your drive with the motor was it coolant that was coming out the exhausts (blown head gasket)  or as simple as just warm engine and humidity in the air?
If the interior trim was white instead of orange, it would have matched the rims and looked awesome.
Mat, you look like the UK version of Moog from Mighty Car Mods lmao
18:03 we german say  DECKEL (sound like "Dekel") the L is important not DEKO ^^. love your vid´s
Mat what an astonishing build, great job, it looks awesome!
Put the color of body on the ring of wheel, that would be much better.
You should try buying a Lamborghini Eurus that has been damaged and rebuild it
This was at the NEC wasn’t it
Remember To Pray Before Eating And Drinking. Spread The Gospel.
For me the wheels ruined it 🙈
It’s Motorhaube in German
Boy the Mansory rolls Royce
these engines are soo fragile why :(
I just love his dad❤❤❤
The rims accents need to be colour coded.
Sorry Matt, I think those wheels look awful. I love this build and all your videos so keep up the good work.
Sad we don’t get this to Europe 😢
The wheels really let it down. Great colour though
I like the color but i think you shouldof goten a an orange color
your incredible dude lol
Mat, the Engine Hood in German is called "Motorhaube", not "Deckel". "Deckel" would be "Lid" like on a Tupperware. Appreciate the effort though!
30:46 A ‘Private’ road with double yellow lines and street lights Hmmm
So next a Koeningsegg?
Looks good brother the colors  ,the wheels 🛞 ❤😂😂😂😂🎉
I love the colour  🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
The white on the wheels match the headlights noice!
You made the mclaren f1 2024 👌
Even the car didnt wanna be seen with those wheels on
Wheels just don't suit it at all👎
The wheel sucks man, the car is fire but those wheels needs to go asap
Ok i m watching more i was wrong bro lookin awesome
WHY....not that color bro ..just saying
Don’t like the wheels. Everything else looks sick
It looked amazing until you fitted the wheels… definitely a marmite choice
Loving the channel mat I’m a Leicester lad to . What happened in the end when it was smocking
If you're german it's "Motorhaube" 18:03
its working perfect and i love it that looks kinda like my dream car to be honest
#1 of 1🏆 Because you're smoking too much weed.  😢 Come on the car is fantastic. But you made it look like a vanilla bean 🫛 extract in Minty fresh tooth paste colour stop trying to be a Gangster rapper and take the lawn mower wheels and put them in the bin . Must be good weed 😅 🏆
Yea   we   are
Wheels  are bad
Jesus Matt ! What were you thinking with that colour mate? 😂 I guess it you like it thats all that matters i suppose
Do you believe in God ? You should...its for your own good!
Nah!! I don't like it
Got sucked in and had to watch from start to finish. Simply amazing work y'all did on this build from scratch. Any calls along the way to McLaren for assistance? Wonder what they think of it. While of course individual taste is what makes life interesting, I can't help but imagine what it would look like in stealth matte black with all of those carbon accents. And of course some sweeet black wheels!
I like it, colour, wheels, everything except the smoke coming out the back.
NICE CAR AND COLOR !!!! WHEELS NO GO FOR ME 🤭but nice job man
Prime example of anything is possible
the car so beatiful , the rims not
i personaly like the car its just in the front it woud be much betther (in my opinion) if it was only the hood thats carbon btw i dont really like putting carbon on cars
I think painting just the wheel arches on the front wings would tie everything together. Thank you for taking the time to post.
Literally looks like a car from GTA 5 it's mad
Lost me on the wheels
So what caused the fire at the end? And what actually happend later?
sorry to say that but in my opinion you have terrible taste for wheels, black ones was much better!
dad using his watch beautiful!!!
Looks awesome it look like mansory
I glad that you like your new allows......if it were me though I would have gone with same colour green over the white on the alloys
That car looks amazing, them wheels were 100% the right choice, tops off the build perfectly
In rock and pop, it’s impossible to build a very large, popular support base without active or tacit support from a group called The Tavistock Institute (U.K.). In the USA, it’s sister organization is called Stanford Research Institute. I knew this a few years ago but it’s only since 2020, that I’ve begun to appreciate that this role, which they themselves call “Social Engineering”, extends to absolutely everything to do, broadly, with “culture”. So that includes the Hollywood studio system, most of TV, major radio channels, even theatre and sport. In fact, sports are hugely important. They’re quite good at this, as you’d expect after 60+ years of doing it.  I’d never considered hobbies, perhaps because even the biggest ones are hugely distributed and not monolithic. Fishing, for example, is tremendously important to mostly men in certain countries. But the sum total of hobby fishing isn’t even a presence politically or top down socially, at least not in U.K. That leaves the internet.
What’s the latest?

I like the color but i have always liked the stock wheels
Ur Dad RuleS!
great color, keep up the good work
Beautiful job 😍 looks sick
I would color match the new carbon fenders to the blue color, but leave the vents/louvers on it carbon
Great job really enjoy the channel. I know its a personal choice, but I can't help thinking it now looks like something Bertie Bassett would drive.
I really don’t like the wheels
Before to after and after to before🗿
Did you see the drag race on carwow on the 720 and the new 750? You have a better car there @MatArmstrongbmx get the tyres right... Sweet
Its look so good.
I would have done the white ring in the matching blue
Mat, Tony, Hannah and team....what has happened to the 720S after it caught fire 🔥??? Has it turned into a minty fresh BBQ??? Guys I'm hoping that you have worked out what caused th e minting fresh fire... Guys when will you complete the rebuild and we see it completed and driving 🚘 around doing donuts etc...

The white on the wheels should have been orange 🍊... sic build !
I love your videos but I’m watching less and less .F**k it’s 90% ad breaks coming up every few minutes, then you doing in video ads as well. I’m sorry but you are becoming un watchable.
Wow!!!!! That's a great color
I think painting those two roofpanels and the white rings on the wheels in the same mint-green as the car would realy top it of
Looks ok rims need to be green
can you make a video where you show all of your cars pls  PS: love your videos
Bruh this car is literally my dream car
wheels are wild, paint match them to the teal maybe? Im getting cyberpunk vibes lol
Love the wheels, very futuristic
Very bright
That Door card is cheaper than a genuine Toyota/Lexus door card 😂😂😂
Sneaky Tony with the door hinge 😂😅😅😅😂😂
what's the song title @ 28:00
Question: Have you ever re-built a car and shipped it to America?
The colour looks fantastic, but yeah those wheels arent doing it for me. I think the problem is that the white rim makes them look really small, almost like you're running fat white wall tyres round a tiny alloy.
Hi Matt when the next video coming out of the McLaren and the rs6 cheers lee
❤👍
My gosh Matt and team, the car looks amazing!!!
Colour is awesome, not sure about the rims though but hey, otherwise awesome work!
Anyone else getting Gulf Racing vibes from it - that colour combo pops but i think the white on the wheels needs to be the same 'papaya orange' as the seats & bits - sick car tho!
Could you please provide us with an update?" - @matamstrongbmx
Sorry to disappoint but Not a private road when it has dubble yellow lines.
@MatArmstrongbmx we germans call the bonnet or hood a "Motorhaube" (engine-hood/cover). The term "Deckel" is rather used for containers or storage items ;-) Keep up the great work mate!!!
beautiful colour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! insane.. amzing
👍🏼🛠🚙
Who the hell told you those wheels would look good 😂. Hope the engine issue is an easy fix
Man that looks crazy. 720s is one of my favourite cars. Hopefully you can fix it without having to remove the engine. Looks Fresh Tho🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
sorry but rims sucks...........
Looks like a lego wheels
This build absolutely slaps! The wheels on it totally complete the car. Just a shame it gave you a little love puff💨 “Hey Freddy it’s been a while” incoming
Bought the drink, im waiting for that carbon disc please, thank you
Can I buy it
Is this Alex Choi?
I want the Matt yfood!! We can't get them in America yet!!
Beautiful car.  It is a piece of art but I  absolutely hate the carbon fiber scheme.  This car needs to flow.  Wheels are just terrible.   Hope the smoke is just a fault reset.
nah man the colour is beautiful
The color makes it look cheap, IMO. But you guys are the experts. I'd think blacked out with gold trim would make it look as expensive as it is.
best car i have ever seen on youtube
I think it's reasonable if you ENJOY carrying out the work and don't consider those hundreds or even thousands of hours spent.  It all depends on how much you value your own time - On average a person lives for 692,040 hours, so IF you enjoy it, as long as you break even, it still works on a personal level.
To be gentle, not the best wheels… the color and the carbon fiber kit has also something who do not fit perfectly visually… anyhow nice works, lets hope it is nothing serious with the engine
New wheels needed, sorry. The engine can be rebuilt
Dude I’d like to make edit errors like that, my entire video is an edit error right now 😅
I always watch your videos love the car love the colour love the editing of your vids and I've always wanted to try the yfood drink banana would be my choice too😂
Rip Turbos
Wheels are disgusting. Rest of the car looks amazing
Wheels very bad 😂
The best channel i have ever watched. Thank you guys. I wonder the engine! What happened next? What's the fault? And could you repaired it yet?
El mejor canal
The McLaren 720 Tron
horrible colour scheme thumbs down
This car imo needs to be black or just a dark color. Batman like
Like the color 👍
I can do with all, color and carbon. The wheels are jsut bad. I know in person it will look much better. But from images it just looks like you put on some cheap smaller winter ones.
Where does the inspiration on the wheels come from?
Car colour looks great with the black contrast bits ....but the wheels look like they belong on a boy racers vauxhall corsa IMO 🙈
Hello Mat,I have seen all your videos to do with your lates protest and smoke come out from the exhaust after your fitted nice wheels, is any updates on your repaired 😮
Lovely looking motor, but wheels are gopping. Looks like you've forgotten to take off some kind of factory transport rim protectors. Sorry!
Engine bad, oh no. But what about second stop light? Does it work when wing is down?
missed the Christmas deadline - shows new years on calendar... hmm?
german here. just wanna talk about the word „deckel“.😂 i really don’t know what porsche was about with that word, but a deckel in german is the cap of a bottle or like some kind of thing that closes some kind of vessel 🤔  we call it „haube“ „motorhaube“ and in really rare cases it’s getting called „kühlerhaube“ but never ever deckel :D
Looks like it should be in the film Tron
Hi Mat. The wheels…. Off the car, the wheels were, horrible. On the car. Wow. Blown away. It totally makes the car unique. Well done mate. Love ya work.
then give it to your wife
love your channel mat  we want ag63
Color is amazing and minty fresh!  Carbon kit too.  Wheels... i don't know it's not for me and i don't think it suites the car , wrong choice
Это сумасшедшая работа.😅
They look like modern versions of the old whitewall tire
Beatiful beatiful car but awfull alloy wheels and bonnet carbon fiber, off mat
fingers crossed on the engine fix
Can someone tell him that bonnet in german is spelled “Motorhaube” and not “Deckel”!!!
Not a very good colour. He could have picked a much better colour than that! And it looks a bit silly being the front half carbon fibre and rear half painted. It would have been lovely if it was all carbon fibre panels! What on earth are those white discs around the edge of the wheels?! The main wheels look look quite a nice design as they are a copy of GT3RS wheels. But the wheels would look much better if they were not black.
The video should be called, idiot wastes money on repairing a car, then destroys it
Possibly the most beautiful car I’ve ever seen… ruined by those wheels 🤢
This McLaren is BANGING!!!! FIRE FIRE FIRE
Why these wheels?? such a disappointment
Them wheels have destroyed the look of that car.😢
looks amazing u ever need a hand it me up
If you wanted "glass" roof panels my friend can make them. He works for falcon special projects kings cliffe east northants. They make all the curved acrylic glass for Fairline Yachts and many others. Would be a cool thing and once dies are made maybe a market for them (alot cheaper than mcclaren)
Sorry dont like the wheels.
Aye Im minty yall are using my color XD
Haube is the word in German  Deckel is more lid
Those r Stradmans wheels
WOW !!!
Amazing job Mat,As per! I just can’t get on with those wheels😞
The wheels 😢
so bad wheels :/
i love ur videos i subsribed and liked :)
Amazing work, well done (I'm a no on the wheels, but what do I know!)
Just putting the same colour of the body panels on the wheels or what you can call instead of white and it should be perfect
The body colour should of been on the wheels not the white
You guys are so inspiring
Great stuff Matt - at some point I reckon you could do a bio on your old man, he's a dead set legend
can you pls rebuild ag63 it would be so entertaining
Everyone is talking about a fucking color no one talk about who this guy is failing in every project he start every singe car of him have engine issues
So, what happened to the engine? Is it ok?
Sorry but the wheels make it look unfinished. The colour I’m not sure of as I’m not there. It’s amazing what you do and I enjoy watching your content. Thanks.
Wow that is looking so dam cool.  Your Dads a hoot.  All the best from Mclaren country NZ
Looks like it has white walls.
This guy looks like TJ Hunts brother in the thumbnail
My first Mat Armstrong Video since watching you on Road to Success.  Off to a good start I'd say 👌🏼
Them wheels are an L Everything else is brilliantly done
I think the parts that are black on the body, it would have looked a bit cooler if it was orange to match with the seats :D
Awesome job, WOW, the car colour, the carbon fibre kit and the wheels are brilliant  Enjoy this car, how much did it cost to buy and all the parts and companies you used?.
Hi mat my name is Mark, I am from Nottingham not too far from where you are. I would love for you to help me to get my dream car with your expertise in your help. I’d love to own Honda, civic type r. I hope you can help me in someway get one okay you take care
That's for putting those crazy wheels on it... lol... only jokes dude, really hope it's an easy fix. Can't wait for the next episode.
Why isn't there a video this week?
Whens the rs6 coming back
Incredible job !!!  Don't like the paint job at all, that color simply does not go with the black. Also don't like the wheels at all. But a mind boggling amount of work. Curious what the final cost was to build this.
Mostruosa complimenti 🎉🎉gradi
is there going to a vid on sunday on the second channel
Your dad is so cool n always smiling 😊big respect to you and your team big hugs from Mauritius Island u guys should visit Mauritius once a day 😊
Hi Matt fantastic great job 👏🏿 to you and the boys 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
is that Harry redknapp ? 27:45
Please color match that ring on the rims to the car.
Finaly someone who did a mclaren right
So is the engine OK. Or still in question ?
Besides the very questionable wheel choice the car turned out extremely well. Congrats :D
can you rebuilt an old Lada 2105? i know they arent very fast or supercars but i still like them
Sorry Matt but those wheels simply don't look good...
From 30 feet away, it will look like you've added wide white walls from a 1950 Buick.
In the words of Captain Slow "there is no fun in a super car when your only able to apply 20% power all the time when you can get a care where you can apply all the power all the time"..
Hi @MatArmstrongbmx - you probably not even gonna see this. anyway worth a shot, what is the color code on the car used, I have a lexus 350 i need to respray, and just absolutely love the color you choose. Really hope you reply. Im all the way from South Africa :D
them wheels have ruined that car, please putthe originals back on
Wing UK fender USA  Guard Australia,   As for the hood here in Australia we call the bonnet.   Show us what ya got under ya bonnet .....  Pretty minty colour Mat, great choice of colours .looks awesome..... and your better half even gets under the car on hoist to help I really love your content ...... I watched you in the early stages, and I thought oh just another rebuild,  but your channel is becoming  better than , West Coast Customs
looks straight out of tron, love it.
For me the wheels don’t suit the rest of the car!  The white rings make the wheels look really small  Paint the white rings a different colour and it will look loads better
This is DTM nostalgia!!!!!!
I just came here to hear him say ''bompa''.
Such an entertaining video. The car looks amazing - except for the wheels! Everything else on the car is black or blue - but white? Sorry Matt.
Nice to see it finally finished 🔥 Liking the mint color with the Carbon! Yeah.. the wheels not that much
I'm a big fan of your channel @MatArmstrong and usually prefer the lower end of the market like the Golf R etc but this build has been IMMENSE. Love it!
Finally a modern car with white wall tires, I like!
you must change the wheels
Cool build, really ugly though. The color is fine, but the carbon fenders just look horrible unpainted and the wheels are garish.
I love the wheels 😍
The car is fucking goals plus the wheels were the cherry on top
Those rims look awesome and they fit!
Like this made for YouTube barn finds or rebuild something exotic finds
These are the same wheels as stradmans Lamborghini wheels yeah?
Respect to you and i know its your car but my opinion the wings need to be colour match and the bonnet done in the same black as the roof.
Nice!!!!!
But how much did it cost to rebuild it? is it cheaper than the actual car, just wanna know cause I was planning of doing this
The wheels look great but don't fit to the car. Maybe other wheels would solve the engine issues 😊
It looks amazing!
Ugliest wheels!
sorry mat but i dont like your wheels at all......better put the old ones back.
Guys any info would be helpful. Does anyone knows how to polich windshield from scraches if there's no windshield replacement on the market? Car is Lancia Delta 3. Ty
Hello mat I just want to say thank you I watched you for other a year and u inspire me when I’m older I want to be a mechanic ❤(please read this)
It’s not Deckel, it’s Motorhaube. Deckel means lid and you call it boot lid too, but it’s where you put your luggage, not where the motor is located. ^^
Very TRON looking McLaren with the whitewall wheels.  Curious to know what the tops would have looked like with the blue.  Cool project
If your gonna buy a new car can it be G80 M3 or G82 M4
Love the colour and the body kit, but the wheels are not for me 🤮🤮 👍👍
Interesting Wheels it fits the car ..i dig it
Dont care for the wheels but they, you like them and thats all that matters!
Post more often!!!
Almost commented on the outro as well but it was hilarious 🤣 no issues
I live 20 minutes from where you bought it and I've seen it! this is fantastic! just a shame about the ending.
are you still going ahead with the  gaming channel ?
Bro I’ve watched so many of these kind of videos and yours are the best! Never give up on your future man! Also I LOVE the color you went with!
Love the color but the carbon hood with fenders make it look tacky. They should definitely be painted for better flow. The carbon splitters and bits are enough carbon
I want to see you rebuild a Tesla 😊😊
One of the nicest maclaren out there for sure
the wheels are stinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’ve definitely would pick another color and wheels… but good job!
Could you buy me a miata as my first car🙏🏽
Absolutely unreal. Watched you from the start, every video and to now what the channel is. It’s just mental. I’ve no doubt in saying, there will be a salvage Bugatti build at some point on this channel. Mark my words 😂 your dad is a star also and the whole team. Just brilliant! You deserve all the success 🫡
Day 2 of asking if you can do jaguar xj8
You jinxed it putting them awful wheels on 😂 great video though love your stuff
Crazy. Depth, Sprinkle - no issues 😊
Those wheels are horrendous
акцент как будто надо выплюнуть что то.
You really ruined it with those wheels, even the car apparently rather set itself on fire than be seen with those uglyass wheels 😂 all jokes aside, beside wheels beatifuly done - colour and carbon kit are really mint.
Car looks sick but I must say the glossy black wheel.. was 🔥🔥 you should stuck with those but the new ones are unique👍🏾
That looked on-finished indeed
HELLO BROTHER MAT, CAN YOU REBUILT A TOYOTA SPRA MK 4 PLEASE 😀
Dam. Its really look amazing specially from the back ❤
What went wrong with the engine
@MatArmstrongbmx what amapiano song is that? 23:22
„Deckel“ - its called Motorhaube😂
Hi
I love it, it’s mint
You should paint shark teeth's on the front of the car.
Mint AND Carbon 🤮 WHEELS 🤮🤮🤮
this is the coolest car i have ever seen
Nice wheels, but they look pretty similar to ones ftom Green Lambo. Or am I wrong?
Keep them coming mate
Can you please do a car collection video
Don’t like the wheels. Great car and color
Wheels are disappointing
Please Matt, I am worriwd sick of tour problems, and I hear norhing from you annymore. Is the engineer home so ztotal and you do have a Hugo probleem I think. Van you yell me that you van salvage the engineer it do you nerf som help financially it whatever. Or am I to worried and you just What Some time of to get the monetair make the McLaren?  Please let me know of you are ik I wordt every day! Of ou two are ok and just need Some Time of. Excuse my English I am Dutch beat Amsterdam.   All the best for you two.   Michael
I think it caught fire because of those ugly ass wheels you put on it... LOL I'm still a big fan Matt! love the paint.
Those wheels make it look like the old fashioned Whitewall tyres.
Wouldnt be surprised if the high level brake light turns off because having a brake light obstructed with the wing off is an mot failure or something.
White hub caps have to go sorry otherwise "WOW" The best looking Macca ever !!!!!
Stunning colour, great choice. Love the carbon kit, except the wings (IMHO) which I think would have been better painted. Wheels totally destroy the look for me. Brave choice and I understand why you went for it but it didn’t work out this time. Overall though, an amazing job and it doesn’t matter what I think, it’s your car.👍
beep beep
Them wheels def don't match that car or the color scheme.  Car should of been painted snow flake white with the orange seats , think  Cream sickle. Then the white rims would of matched.  Plus the white would of matched all that carbon fiber ..  👍💯
Each to their own , but them wheel completely ruin it , but that's my opinion 🤷
Sorry,needs a Little blue on the wells,just 2 cms.
"Motorhaube" If ur German ;D
Horrible!
"Decal" for "Bonnet" is definetely not german. I think someone refered to some sticker at the bonnet.
Brilliant guys looks fantastic
Should put on a carbon fiber front bumper
Almost the perfect combination and then there were the wheels that ruined that combination.
Wow! Road trip to Naples in the 720s on the Amalfi Coast? Thoughts Mat
looking forward to engine rebuild video =0
That outro 🤣🤣🤣
This reminds me of a Audi S2 project we did with my father. We installed ABT bodykit to it and spent 6 months buildiing it. During first test drive oil spilled with high pressure and it set on fire. The whole front burnt. All the rubber pipes and lines and the body kit which was glass fiber almost completely destroyed. Most devastating situation in my life for sure :D. After 2 weeks of depression we started over and after 3 months we did a new test drive with extinguisher on the back seat and it was perfect. In any project the more you have downfall the more better it feels when it's complete. I think the most used sentence i have used is "i give up" but i never had. I think this car hobby is some sort of masochism but it just feels so good in the end. :) I hope everything works out for you!
Mat I’m a huge fan whatever happened to your RS6
Like the car, colour pops for sure.. not sure about the wheels but hey, not my car!! Well done.
Wheel mania always go above and beyond.
Looked amazing until you put those terrible wheels on, if you're going to choose such odd wheels at least change the white to mint green or carbon
A "Deckel" goes on a bottle. The hood is actually called "Haube". :E
Needs to wrote off again looks a mess with the wheels rest of is decent also click bait as it never set of fire the engine needs attention oil seals or rings over filled oil. Over heating issue! Just smoke NO FIRE
Wtf are those wheels
That looks wrong , that color sucks bro.
Mat you select some fabulous colours for the cars gotta say I love them all!
Matt you have disappeared,no up load this week since this last video 😬
You calling it waifu on purpose?
You brake the turbos mate! :) By the way the car is sick!
Amazing . Love your teams work 💪
In Germany it is called „Motorhaube“ (Bonnet) and not „Decke“ 😋💪 amazing video as always 👌
mat-man has become batman
Call me boring, cannot help it must speak the truth from the heart, cannot sing along just to sing along and let pressure get to you. Color is one thing, don't like it but I get why you did the contrast with carbon, otherwise too much so get that, I would get something else but see this or similar to this color on quite a few cars these days and still not warming up but whatever float your boat, that is the import part the job itself is amazing either way and maybe one get used to it?  The rims though, I suspect never, for a modern old school style rally theme, maybe, on a 720s?
Like videos but what a foul colour. Each to his own
Matt's dad is always smiling, laughing, and giggling.  What a nice guy
It looks great, now you need to check out the DDE rebuild of their 720
In German the hood is called Motorhaube
I’m driving and I saw an old BMW 6 series and it got me thinking? What happened to the old bmw project? Also, more videos from your dads f430 would be a good idea
18:05 oh god I'm gonna be that guy, I'm so sorry....... "Deckel" in german usually just means "lid" for bottles, etc. For the hood/bonnet of a car we usually say "Motorhaube" (quite literally "engine bonnet", I guess). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm german and I've never heard anyone referring to it as anything else. And now that I've established that I am indeed fun at parties.. Thanks for the entertainment Mat, love your work! <3
I really hope you're painting all that carbon to match the car
In the Last Century we were using that colour combination in some of the office fit outs. It looks wicked on the McClaren, and the wheels seal the deal. Hope you get the engine issue ironed out. 👍🖖
Mat if the white was glow in the dark on the wheels😫 but the white is tuff too great build it looks amazing
Sorry but cars that low are pathetic
Sorry Matt, those wheels look awful!!
Nice one matt !! I’m not sure on them wheels they are cool but think they need maybe abit of the blue to match the car , might be pictures don’t do it justice, but still very cool car !!! What next ??
first comment
18:03 its not deckel its motorhaube
IT DID NOT DESERVE THAT
GREAT CAR
Second supercar engine you've lunched in a couple of months now 😢 I know adding some peril and disaster is good for views, but can you be a bit more careful with them please!
Sorry matt, its not W I D E Enough, Damons 720GTR now thats W I D E. lol
Had to laugh about the "Deckel" bit hahah but actually we call it "Motorhaube" ;-)
Car looks incredible mate the wheels wouldn't be for me, hopefully the engine isn't too bad my thoughts were rings gone
Looks beautifully spectacular
Would've preferred the white to be mint as the body.
Oh my god,  I loved it, infact i have been following your  Whole journey with this McLaren, but i feel amazing today seeing it running. Just at the end issue with engine smoking again  But i know you got it. Right 👍
WTF happened during the edit at 10:30 lol
Ok next episode 😊
Great video Mat, Wheels are the worst I've ever seen on any car. 😕
You need a tune !!!
it’s „Motorhaube“ in German😂
change the wheels to original - they look so bad and ruin the look - CHANGE THE WHEELS !!!
Why are the wheels the same at the left and right side? Take a good look! In the white aerodynamical part of the rim it pointing backwards on the right side, but on the left side it's pointing forwards. At high speed it can give an unstable situation.
Tron MCLAREN ❤
I am watching YouTube videos regulary but only durring your videos the adds are pure s*it . I understand that we need them but there are 2 adds for ladies shawing and washing and that is it. I saw them like 1000times. Only durring your videos. Maybe wrong add setup ? Dunno.
I do love the colour with the carbon but Sorry the wheels don't do it for me, it looks like you have white walls on the the car
Nice work
Love the colour. The wheels.. not so much
the color of the car is AMAZINGGGGG LOVE THIS GUYS WORK😃
The car looks amazing !! I didn’t expect that but it totally works and the wheels 🥰 also don’t you think you pushed a bit hard for a first run? 🫣 lol
Love the design of the wheels  not the white though, it looks a thought you have white wall tyres on it , shadow chrome may have worked better or change the white for more mint green could look time attack .
Love the build but I think it world be better with painted wings
This video=SOOO GOODNESS!!!
Nice whitewall! Lol
An amazing video as always! Any updates on the rs6?
Looked like steam coming out was it the head gasket?
The car don't like your wheels, that's why she screwed up😂
Awesome job guys the car looks incredible.
That’s the same colour as my parents bathroom suite 😅
Love this build, but.. will you keep the deep b...bless, just as i was about to ssk if the wing will stay he pulöed out the carbon one.  Salvation 😂
I like the old videos as they were far more interesting and fun, as it was not about crazy super cars so many YouTuber channels have.
Even the motor didn't like the wheels 🤣 Wheels are a no go
Them drinks are so bad for u , full of synthetic vitamins n minerals
Bend hinges.. that's what they do in the factories like Audi ect., sometimes they even stand on doors
Great build. Love the colour and body kits. The wheels aren’t for me but you go enjoy. Oh and I’d splash the cash get the glass roof 😊
Maybe a turbo failure for the smoke???? Love these videos.
The bonnet ruined the car should've been the same colour as the car.
I really wish the rings on the wheels were side specific. 😢
super build! The wheels are cool however the white section needs to be a different color. Maybe carbon fiber?
Colours nice but the carbon wings and bonnet don’t, and sorry but the wheels are awful.
Its (no not the bat mobile) The Matt Mobile! My first thought when I saw the rear diffuser go on!
Noooo color is for Paris Hilton! … Noooo
But mad I f you can remember you overfilled the oil  and I smoked could that be the same problem
I also think you should paint the white rims mint.
Last morning I was late to work becaouse of you. Been watching your videos...😂😂😂😅
The car is amazing my personal touches would be paint the fender and keep the carbon louvers, make the exhaust tips carbon and abit out ,paint the calipers, and deffnitly another set of wheels😂
What is the colour called
Brought to you by Gulf.
Scirocco mk2 tear drop thro back. Nice
So is the car working 100 percent or not ?
Burning coolant... Engine very bad! :)
dope! love the color - great job matt - you are amazing and you're dad is so funny! peace be with you and greetings from southern California.
I would love to see the pluses and minuses. What did it cost to buy, to fix and the number of man hours and what is it worth now. In short an audit.
Wheels need to be all black. Sorry
Is there anyone that actually likes these wheels? I haven't seen 1 positive comment yet
Looks like it would be a car you would see in Tron.. love it
Over 2 million people watched your dreams go up in smoke 🤣🤣
Love the colour, hate the wheels, sorry Matt
14:33 Took delivery today of 6x Y-Food Mat Armstrong Edition and a Taster pack! Been looking for an excuse to buy and a McLaren carbon disc sounds good 🤣
But Mat, why would you promote shit like this. Never mind. Unsus.
Its soo wierd to see new cars.. made of.. ^plastic^ ye.. i know its not the right thing to say but.. we are getting to a point where you get a little bump in the car and the whole thing breaks in half.. idk the feature looks wierd to me :D from safe to unsafe
❤ I have most my cars on GTA with white walls
Please don't sell it or give it away
nah those are the most beautiful wheels I have ever seen
Smart. You blew your head gasket.
looks unfinished with the exposed fenders
I didn't quite catch it in the end. Is the car ok now after the little fire? Thanks to anybody who can clarify.
bonnet is "Haube" in German :) Love your channel and your work!
Great job with the build. But I would've honestly went for those wheels without the white circle around it and I'd change the color of the brake calipers and the interior to match the exterior color
Lobe the colour choice bro and what journey it's been to see this beast come to life from where it was when you first picked it up! Lets hope it's not 'engine very bad'  😅
Mint green to replace the white on the wheels would be sick
Looks like the Tron legacy bike. Fantastic!
I’m not a fan of the wheels but it’s not my car. So it’s your car you can have it how you want.
Minty fresh... it's just Cyan.
Great job on the car fellas, but those wheels nah nah sorry.
Well I wash I could buy ur yfood product but u don’t sell to Australia 🇦🇺 😂
it's not deckel in german. It's called Haube :)
Love the colour but still not sure on the wheels. Appreciate why you did them and good on ya
those wheels MAT common bro...
First of your builds I’m not into the colour scheme. Just can’t see it, wheels too 👎🏻 entertaining video as always, love the channel.
Love the wheels looks like it's on white walls
Clickbate worked. Thats for sure.
can we all agree that colour looks sick for the mclaren
We definitely need the remaining parts of the video in order to enjoy this video fully. Waiting
Those rims are just not for me 10 out of 10 ugly
Love Mat and loved watching this build but this car looks teeeeerrible
Definitely love the colour. Gotta wonder, did you warm it up at all before that first proper drive in ages? :P
incredible until the wheels...
Wow Matt, an amazing finish, love the colour, custom rims 🫠 the white bit 🤷 maybe live, it would be more appealing 🎉
Guys look at Matt wilz McLaren 720 do you think Matt Armstrong copied him?
where does he get all this money? does he have a money machine?
I'd love a full detailing episode where you just make it shine in the end.. when it finally lives :D!
i love the look of it
Not the color of my choice😵‍💫
Looks like you going to end up consulting Freddie for the rebuild of that engine Mat, he rebuilt his again rock-solid, a necessity if it’s going to be reliably strong and able to put out the power when you need it, right?!….  🤦🏻‍♂️😅
A McLaren on fire 🔥. Say it aint so 😂
Smokey and the bandit? 😂😂😂
0 - 60 mph in 2.8 DAYS 😎
Blown head gasket?
Am i the only one whos getting Stradman vibes from those wheels 🤔
How do you 'lock' the bolts? when attaching panels and covering the bolts?
In typical mat fashion that catastrophic smoke at the end will be a hose that's popped off a nice quick easy fix.  If that happens on a chris slix video, it'll be bent valves a cracked block and will require a complete new engine 😂
Please paint the wings mate and leave carbon Accents. It’s not a Honda mate 😂
This ended up looking incredible! i LOVE them wheels. really makes the mint pop
The McLaren looks like a vehicle out of the movie TRON...LOL
Thats gas. The livery,alloys and carbon kit is mad gorgeousness
Cool build amazing👌👌👌👌
I am all about what you are doing day in and day out. I feel your pain and fun. However, a lot of YouTubers start rebuilding these high-end cars without the proper skills, education, or equipment/tools. It runs for a bit, and then all these projects from many builders fail. This car is no joke. It takes years of skills, education, and mechanics to understand it or build it properly. I am sorry to be that guy, but even I know my limits with my BMW boxes.
In the beginning with the color I was like wtf and in the end I was like dammmmmm matt you did it again 😂😂💯💯💯not feeling the rims too much but I mean it looks okay 😎😎
VTuned already did one 🤷‍♂️
Absolutely a beautiful car! A piece of art, but one thing i’m not really on board with is the carbon front fenders, now i’m not saying it’s ugly or anything but it just looks a bit off. (Not trying to be rude btw)
Those wheels are hideous
the minty fresh, carbon, and wheels are inzane epic
The ‘custom’ designed wheels are Pagani knock-offs.
Hello probably a long shot but can i please have the old wing amd have you and your dad sign it for me?
That is one beautiful car Mat. Well done.
Great video!... paint color is a bummer tho. Tavarish wins that round
Looks like you did a Tavarish! Gave it the beans before the engine was at its optimum temperature. Premature giving it the gas! She’s cooked!
Honestly, I hated the paint till' you brought out the wheels. Love it now! Sorry bout the smoke, brother! Welcome to McLaren ownership lol.
IF YOU DONT LIKE THE WHEELS, SIT ON A DILDO😂 All that smoke seems to be a blown turbo, or a oil feed line blew to the turbo. I don’t think it’s the engine tbh.
you can put shark teeth on it i think look so cool
I'm in the US and can't order the why food that stuff looked good
That car looks brighter than my future.  Excellent work by all, tis an absolute joy watching your content. Keep up the excellent work.
Car is beautiful, wheels are terrible.
Awesome restoration Mat! Keep up these amazing videos
viscount biscuits 😂
You need to wrap the wheels same  blue,  and smoking could be the oil catch can system clogged on it.
Gave away da colour on da wing !😂
Sorry mush wheels do that car favours….😱
If you have merch, you should send some of the broken parts of your cars to your fans. I’d love one.
The color is cool
McLaren moment
MINT is my childhood dream color 🥹
He loves ruining cars with wheels I swear
I would probably have painted the wheel trim the color of the car. OR!!! get another set of those trims in the color of the car and you can swittch them out from time to time!
Why am I thinking polo mints when I see the wheels.
That's is one hell of a good looking McLaren I have to say. I absolutely love everything about it, you've smashed this build out of the park!
The car was so ashamed of the new look killed itself 😅 imo
Anyone else getting a TRON vibe? I like it
The mint and black looks amazing but the wheels why white if it was mint or even black it would look fantastic…….. yet another great video Mat keep up the good work 👍🏻
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO I CANT GIVE MORE HAND UP THAN ONE  T_T HELP ME GUYS!!!!!!!!!!! GIVE HIM MORE THUM<3 UP!!!!!!!!!!!!
I think You will be like Richard Hammond in future ;) Cheers :3 About workflow ;3  Damn cliping look so sasistfyiing :3 PS sorry for my english., I'm not native english speaker :3 PS2: Sir DaD! i can wait :3 PS3: someone need to repair voice in 10:35
color is fire
Amazing video and built … white rings on the wheels totally messing up the rest of the car.  Mint + carbon are an absolute killer choice!
Crazy and Beautiful at the same time :)
Color wonderful!
Just looks awesome
The white on the wheels is a bit ambitious, but nice either way
saddest grandma's wheels i ever seen, the dude kill the aesthetic of the car
I love it ❤ the wheels are like something out of bennys workshop on gta5. It looks mega
Mat, keep up the good work! It's always so entertaining to watch your videos. Also as a German I can say "Deckel" is not quite the right word for the hood, it's actually called "Motorhaube" haha
Bruh, that are many views
So did you guys fix the engine? What was the fault.. you didn't say? Love the car and colour beautiful.
Going to really pop that colour in the sunshine 🌞 nice
Sorry, Matt and team. The wheels are awful. Love the rest, mind you. Well done on getting to this stage. It's a staggering achievement by you all.  Please just re-think the wheels as they destroy the overall image of this beautiful car. Good luck with the engine. I do hope its not a gonna.
Mat, can you upload more videos in Spanish please🙏🙏
DECKEL !!!! 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Not gonna lie, seeing a bit of AMG One in there.
Done a great job, love the wheels, but how come, with exlensuve custom designed wheels, the teardrops in the outer rings arent directional? Means they face forward on one side, and backwards on the other.
"Deckel" isnt really what we say normally we say "Motorhaube"
Those wheels are horrible… makes them look really small…
wheels are ugly
What about the 1989 BMW 635csi bro😭😭💔
would you buy a crashed gtr r35 and rebuild it please
The Tavarish influence with that beautifully bright color!
Colour is 👌🏼
the rims are totally not matching the car and the fender make very bad separation between the front and back , other than that it's a special color , keep up the good work 👏
Has Matt now finished all his cars?
I'm german, and we definitely don't call a hood/bonnet deckel 😂😂😂😂 It's motorhaube, which means enginehood 😄
It's not "Deckel" in german it's "Motorhaube" or just "Haube", greetings from Bavaria
Colour code the wheels trims
Mat is the only youtuber to make you watch his ads because you skip the ad you lose out on some content and he makes ads not boring 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
In Germany you call the bonet "Motorhaube" not "Deckel" @MatArmstrongbmx
Holy shit that minty fresh paint color is so sick! But I gotta say it, those wheels are ruining the build Matt 🤮 at least you like them brother, that is all that matters!
Always like how you fix your cars choose the colour then buy wheels but for this 1 particular car you bought the ugliest wheels 1 could think of..😭😭💔
Amazing Car Mat! Let me say as a German, Deckel is close enough! But anyway we call it Motorhaube (engine hood) I really want to hear this from you haha
Matt   I been watching ur channel for a while  Love it  Best thing on YouTube  I love cars  And love normal people making it   No ego No giving it the large  No rubbing it in peoples faces  Ur pure class bruv    I watched ur history house and car and work and jobs video today   Very inspiring    Complete legend u are     Thanks for the great videos  and I will continue to watch
Loving the look!  Spaceship!
The wheels and the colour look amazing what a car. Keep it up
dunno bout the wheels lol
Could the smoke be overfilled oil again from car being tilted coming off the transporter meaning engine could be fine?
not sure how old you are Mat, do you remember Eddie Freola " the flying banana" ? top BMX freestyler back in the day
Didn’t realise this was going to need inspected to be uk registered.  I hope the next video isn’t titled “they Q plated my McLaren” 😂😂
Do you still have a air up discount code bud
I hate the colour.
Cracking re build - It should now be called Bladerunner…❤
There is a reason why nobody would put those wheels in a 720s
Mat. The car build has been great. But I’m  not much on the colour you chose, but it is your car. My biggest dislike. Are the rims, it looks like you have put. White walled tyres on it. I hope the engine is okay, but I will wait for your next video. A complete re-shell build is not easy. As I have done one myself. When I was working at the garage. I was doing it after I had finished work for the day. And it was only me and the person who did the damage as help. But we got it done in 5 weeks of evenings and the odd weekend.
Those rims just killed the whole build, which was flawless. Stock ones looked 1000x better
Great Vid as per usual. Hope engine ok Beauty is in the eye of the beholder so the saying goes 😂. Colour doesnt do it for me and wheels too much like coco the clown 😢 Not my car though Keep up the great work  Cheers
Great colour but those wheels just make it look like you haven’t taken the wheel protection off from new 😂, but it’s your car and if you like it’s all 👍
Excellent work guys looks amazing and minty fresh
Awesome colour but not a big fan of the wheels 😅
Honestly the wheels aint that bad! Its unique, i like it
the wheels are one of one the only thing remotly similar is thestradmans pink ones have a similar colour strip like the white bit, the car is beutiful though
Fantastic. I love the colour of the car. Cheers n drive safe ❤😊
Wheels are sick! Only things I think I would've done differently regarding color would be to paint the front wings (fenders) and the white rings on the wheels in the same minty green, but I don't think either of those things as you've done them detract in any way
Tavarish part 2 😂😂😂 o nooo
The bonnet is called „Haube“ in German ;-)
Can't wait for the next video hope the 720s is fine
In german it is Motorhaube mate😂😂
Could the smoke not be from overfilling the oil like last time??
It caught on fire when it looked in the mirror and saw these butt ugly wheels!!!!!! I love the car but how could you spec those wheels?????????
It would have been nice if the wheels are similar to the car color.
Yo its looking ugly bro with that color
Same as stradman fully carbon aventador wheels
Cooked it with the wheels. Bronze wheels would work best.
isnt that dannyp1818's mclaren in your thumbnail?
Mint instead of white on the wheel rings, or try again. TheStradman's Lambo has similar wheels with pink rings and it seems to work with his color scheme. Carbon's cool but too much carbon on the fenders. It interrupts the flow of the body line.
Amasing color !!!!!! but WTF you do with that wheels....
Love the build but…..the white wheel trims? NOOOOOOO! They look like white walls, get them off and get them in carbon…..PLEASE! saying that….its look like you may some other,  more important  issues!
Horrid wheels spoilt the build
This looks unreal Mat!! Love the colour and wheels, that kit is a beast!
who the hell wrecked that car so badly that they deemed it unrepairable
next video please
Car looks awesome but the wheels…..dear god no. Have a re think please!!
I'm not sure of the colour or those wheels.
Wish bodges like that hinge you'll end up getting hired where I work 😂
Excellent presentation and lovely energy presentation of your video. Weldone.
RIP McSkillet (*)
They need to take Matt to jail for putting those wheels on the poor car.
I like the wheels
Looks good except for the smoke
Dont know about the wheel rings....gonna hafta let it soak and revisit later......yellow rings maybe???
Ok so ordered the Matt Armstrong Yfood limited edition just for the carbon disc see if will fit on my Tesla 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's not "Deckel" in German, it's "Haube" oder "Motorhaube" in the long term. LG
The wheels are awesome it actually looks like a Tron bike
what was the profits of making the car from wrecked other than buying a new one?
Turned it into a proper "Hot Wheels" look with the colour, carbon split and those wheels. IMO, car looks amazing!!
I was wondering why he was calling fenders "wings" lol. A wing in america is another name for the spoiler.
What a horrible rims! Awful 1000%. I prefer original ones. Good thing engine is ok. That looked like oil smoke!! (fumata bianca...)
I can't imagine how proud your dad is of you!
do full exosed carbon
Mate its called Haube. Deckel is a lid
Are they the same wheels as The Stradman just in  white?
The car is amazing the wheels are very odd-looking and look to heavy for a light-performance car. From the comments, the wheels were a big mistake.
You should get some MatLaren 720s stickers... looks so nice
Truly stunning build. 👌👌👌
Wish we could have seen a wheel without the white rim
Wheels are 🤮 horrid.
Looks like a spaceship now! I like it ❤
"Haube" in German!
I love the wheels cuz it just looks so vintage, unique, and different.The car looks like one of those old porshes with the really cool orange finishing in the interior, keep up the good work mat.
So ... what about the motor ?
kind of a 50's throw-back to white wall tires.. interesting..
I would made the white on the wheels the colour of the car, but awesome
One of the best looking McLaren out there 🩵
Those wheels made me instantly associate it with a 1950's Yank Tank, the rest of the car is amazing.
Oh my God, I think the McLaren is simply refusing to drive around with the 1960 Cadillac looking wheels bro 🙂it's reaching out to you saying "don't do that to me"
Should definitely twin turbo this Mat and send it to Mexico 🙏🏽💙 great work lads
I went from blowing the head gasket I presume........ to it's working fine now? ... guessing that's a video mishap.  Due that sucks the engine shit itself..........  man!........
That would piss me off last minute all that work it's like the' impossible car to re build lol well done though hats off
Btw in German we don’t say „Deckel“ but rather „Motorhaube“
Paint the all white wheel trims Minty Mint.
Good to see you rebuild a New Zealand supercar, we’ll 50/50 Kiwi/ Brit. Maybe you could do the Kiwi Super bike called a Britten next? 😂
Famous last words. The machine works perfectly without any problems......... Come on Mat, fix it permanently and enjoy this surface-to-air missile!
Happy banana 🍌 ❤❤❤ haha nice one MA!   Also awesome car as always of course….
The mclaren 765lt in Curacao blue looks so fresh! Definitely my “dream” supercar. You made this 720s so CLEAN!
Does this guy sell Molly on the side 🤷‍♂️ lol how sway? Without selling any cars. Baller!!!
mclaren 720k to repair
Brilliant job. Wheels are awful though, sorry! 😬
THE CAR LOOKS BEAUTIFUL, IGNORE THE WHEELS, THEY LOOK TERRIBLE. BUTTTTTTTT, THE REST IS AMAZING.
Just recieved my Matt Armstrong  YFOOD  bottles  They are bangin the flavour is so nice can see why u chose this flavour
May God bless you! Thats really fun  work to rebuild cars.
I like the wheels because you like the wheels. You're building it. Make it your own and be happy. Don't lose sleep over the haters.
Wonder what the issue is
Loving that colour mate, really different but it suits the car.
Is it a turbo or is the engine ? .
Love this color❤
That colour is shockingly bad. Disappointed.
Sorry but those wheels are horrible 🤮Colour of the car is great though
poior mclaren me no spek anglish cauze me îs stoopid Buț im kidding 😭
The color is CRAZY I LOVE IT
"Or 'Deckel' if you are german." We call it 'MOTORHAUBE' ! :D in this case there is no engine in front, so more like a 'KOFFERRAUMHAUBE' ;) Greetings from germany
Hodor!
thats a "TRON" car now, i really like it - greets from Munich
...epic! Love it
This car doomed .... lol good color bad wheels for my taste. Nice one though
worst rims ever seen please replace them
one of the best looking mclarens then the wheels ruin it
Bro 26th may is my birthday
That color with Carbon looks so good. Congrats man
Well done Mat...again...love the car and even the colour, not sure about the wheels but hey its just personal preference 👍
You know what? I didn’t really have an opinion when i saw it on insta, but seeing the actual color up close and the carbon detailing and vents etc, it absolutely kicks ass. The wheel details are off chops too. Great job!!
Besides you giving your dad that awesome Ferrari, this McLaren build has been my favorite to watch so far. Matt Armstrong, you're an amazing man along with your dad and your entire crew. Keep up the great videos my friend!
The wheels ruined it. If they were custom made I would've gone with black on the outer rim and the same body colour on the inner rim. It would've looked extremely awesome!
Love the wheels 🫡
Can you do a collab with DDE on a build in their new HQ?
To CHAV
Hate the sea shanty Matt
color good choice
Very Tron like car 👀
The work you have done on this project is amazing. Congratulations! You knew people would react differently to your color choice and to the custom rims.  I'm very happy you like everything you've done.  To my taste, the color and the rims make it look like a "clown car". I get your tastes are what's important, and my response is irrelevant.  Still, you've pulled off a major accomplishment!
Like the wheels; gives it a white wall retro/newvo vibe.
The engine decided to say no when it saw the new wheels chosen for it.
I’m not hating…. You have a McLaren…. You had me till the wheels went on but I’m glad you love it
This blue color looks so bad
Btw I’m building a car rn so I will use the link 😂
Those wheels lmao. What a way to fumble an otherwise epic build.
I was not liking the colour till I saw that carbon body kit
Those two colors are my favorite color combo on a high performance race car and reminds me of the Ford GT40.
Wheels no no
Great job, love the color and the kit, but the wheels, just plain ugly, to ugly for a dog to pee on.
Is that amapiano I hear 😅
What a build 😂 i do think your "bat $hit crazy" at times with what you take on. Hope you get this bad boy properly running 🤞
I've gotta say. Matty, my boy. That color is trash. Horrible.... no sprinkles of carbon can save this. Honestly? It's the first time I disagree with a decision you've made to such a degree that I would comment on it and become "One of them".... I know to each his own, and it's your car you can do as you please. But OMG!!!!!! It's just so wrong. Ok, back to keeping my mouth shut.  Lol.... Still love your channels and content.  Great job!!!!!!👍💪
I don't care what everyone says, I love that. Very bold and just perfect.  p.s. Hope the engine fault is a easy fix :/
9:55 had me rolling how your dad laughed when the cameraman flinched LOL
When I first saw the wheels sitting at the shop I was thinking ohhh boy, what a mistake.. But once mounted, totally changed my mind. Somehow they work? Truly unique setup. I dig it!
Matt, Y-Food won’t ship to USA 😞…can you do anything about this!? Keep up the great work! God bless
Its different, but it very cool.
It's easy to see why you're the fastest growing youtuber. You guys are so genuine and lovable. Hoping that thing doesn't need an engine rebuild, but I'll be staying tuned either way!
i kinda like the color but i cinnda dont at the same time
The wheels ruin it 😢
Yikes
In germany its Motorhaube! (Enginehood)
Loving these longer videos now it’s great 😁😁
Tron!
Time for a 2JZ then. 🤣
Those wheels are sick!! Reminds me of the old white walled tires from the mid 1900’s with a new take on it. 🔥
As always you do great work…congratulations!!! Butttt…!!...in this one I have to tell you that YOU HAVE NOT GOT RIGHT WITH THE DESIGN of the wheels...I would have chosen to keep a little more of the original style, wider to match the additions and preparation of the kit that you have put in, but on that car those wheels don't fit not even with glue... However, congratulations for having it finished and enjoying it...!!!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻...I'm looking forward to the next project that you have prepared for us...!!!
omg it looks so good. Looks Fire 🔥🔥🔥
Great colour, I would say leave the hood carbon but paint the wings to match the car, and I've asked this before when you first got the tub but got no answer from you or maybe anyone else in the comments, why did you swap it to a left hand drive? When it was already a right hand drive for English roads if you're keeping it? I'm confused, does anybody else know?
The wheels kill it unfortunatly.   The White part makes it look like a 15inch
Ive orderd 12 bottles of the happy bannana l, would love to get the disc would be epic 👌👌👌
Hands down my favourite channel to watch. Consistency and Quality is spot on!
Looks very 'Tron Legacy' with those wheels
Not a fan of the wheels. At all. But the rest of the car is totally awesome.
Could have made the wheel trim rings in mint green instead of white?
I reckon the engine gave in because it threw up seeing the wheels it had on now 👀
Stock wheels looked so much better but nonetheless great job with the build. Love the CT carbon bits
Sorry Mat I’ve been away and only just watched the Vid for me the car looks hideous I just don’t like McLaren’s don’t you think there styling is wrong especially the front end Ive loved all of your other builds but this is the worst by far sorry guys still best car channel on YouTube
A monumental amount of work! Well done! 👌🏻
Best looking car in the last decade
looks like turbos r bad
Hey Matt love the videos , the car looks mega in the colour and body kit but I’m sorry them wheels do not do it justice at all. The white totally spoils it , but i guess if you like it that’s what counts .
It is horrible. Amazing talent that Matt and crew are on the mechanics - that really is a mess. Ho hum, can be top at everything. Love the content though.
Why is this actually not bad, u wouldn’t rlly like this colour but it’s mad bro, great vid bro keep it up
I love the way the white exhaust smoke matches the wheels, its like a red arrows display 😂😂   you really know how to harm yourselves. Brilliant filming, fantastic content, great personalities, awesome cars, whats not to like?  Missing Hannah, shes not around much these days so its great when she pops in.  Your smiles give us smiles, awesome, just awesome, thank you ❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love what you do. Love the car. Hate the wheels but you love them and that’s all that matters ❤
Please don’t put those god awful “4D”number plates on this one. Love all your builds but the number plates let them down massively in my opinion. Standard number plates are the best. 😂
The car colour which the carbon 😍👌🏼. Wheels are also nice just look awful in that colour.
Wouldn't that car be registered to the second hand tub you got
Put a 93 octane tune on it and put 91 octane fuel in it for us again pretty please? I will subscribe
M3 build incoming?
Love it!!!!
loved it
Make the white rings body colour green
public space not private road mate
Needs new wheels 😅
Tron is born. Super cool.
Hey, on 18:03 its not Deckel, its a Motorhaube. : ) Love from Germany
£1400 for a windshield ? I think it's cheaper than on my Nissan s14🤣 they quoted me €1000 + the "installation kit", and that was 15 years ago, probably in the 2000 range now with everything you need to install it ...
In the thumbnail the god dam fender opened with the door😂
This build is insane, but those wheels are HORRIBLE... Totally ruining the car design Wheelmania always makes you amazing wheels, always, but those.... my lord 🤢
Love the videos Matt... But those Polo mints on the wheels hurt my eyes.
Wheels are nuts
stunning job boys
It didn't fit because it was made in Britain
Bruhh the white on the wheels looks ugly but besides that beautiful build good job, let’s hope nothing is wrong with the McLaren please post a video soon on updates, and by the way I love you’re videos excellent content keep it up
Wheels look 💩. Otherwise, the car looks mega. The exhaust isn't levelled. The right side is slightly dipped...
Not feeling the wheels. Awesome build otherwise
Instead of bonding the roof panels could u make clips so u could remove them! 🤔Lie a T-bar 🤣
Looks like a blue poison frog or salamander. Cool!
Love the build mat!! The only thing I would have done different is painted the front wings body colour. It looks a little odd with black front wings……  Oh and LOVE the wheel choice!!
What diffuser is bigger that rs6 diffuser or the 720s diffuser? Think you'll have to check once the rs6 is back in the UK.
Loving the videos but lets not promote unhealthy foods  Ingredients   Ingredients : Semi-skimmed milk, water, milk protein, vegetable oils (rapeseed, sunflower), coconut milk, gluten-free oat fibre, soluble corn fibre, rice powder (rice flour, rice starch, rice syrup), banana powder 0.1%, vitamins (A, C, D, K, B1, B3, B5, B6, folic acid, biotin), minerals (magnesium, iron, copper, manganese, selenium, chromium, molybdenum, iodine), emulsifier lecithin; maltodextrin, sweetener sucralose; stabilisers gellan gum, processed euchema seaweed; lactase, natural flavourings  Maltodextrin is extremely bad for metabolism because it lacks nutritional value and may also spike your blood sugars  Not only does sucralose undergo thermal degradation when it’s heated, but researchers also found that chloropropanols that comprise a group of contaminants, including genotoxic, carcinogenic and tumorigenic compounds, are generated.  These are just a few of the ingredients, be careful what you eat/drink  Apart from that, love the car
Mat gets no brakes hahah poor guy, sick build annyway
That's a blown turbo or worse, same thing happened to DDE with their 720s
GTA V car 👍🏻
Car mint Wheels look terrible 😮
i love your dad,he s very cool :)
The wheels not the best choice. I don't own the car, if you like them Matt that's all that matters.
Great build mate! Congratz!🎉👏
lol   ummmm no.  Those panel gaps are because one, you have crappy aftermarket fenders that do not fit right.  And the inside door gap, you didnt adjust the clips right.
Something like Black-Yellow or Orange carbon would be cool. Car like a WASP. Dangerously fast be aware. As you have Black-Orange interior.
what if the top two bits were also painted that blue? or the orange of the calipers
It’s a no for me on the wheels 😕
love the color and carbon. Sorry Mat, not a fan of the wheels.
those wheels are hideous lol.  do not do the car any justice at all.  looks amazing otherwise
Awesome
Car got mad at you for choosing such wheels and it decided to commit sekuku.
Beautiful! Well done man!
Hi matt,  The car is sick. Love the colour. I think it would look perfect with the front fenders painted but keep in the air ducts the carbon exposed. Than it perfectly flows like in the rear
From my 10 year old, he likes the wheels. (You are the content we watch together). For me I dont like the wheels  look like polos and in the dark look small. There you go 50/50.
Not a fan of the wheels at all, body colour looks nice though
Mats dad is such a vibe 😅
It just wouldn’t be a MA build without an engine pull lol...sorry Mat, love the content!
finally some decent rims mateee
Can you rock the wheels with the white rings off? That pretty hot yo!
dude ! the wheels and car look sick! . 😍😍😍😍😍
The LGBT swerve gets them every time, they lock up and forget why they were talking to you in the first place 😅
What happened to RS6? We getting that back to UK yet and fixed? If not give it me 😂
Great job👍until the wheels went on🙄...
You know Hammond is gonna break out the Polo mint gag..... 😂
will buy yfood whenever they are no longer in bed with nestle
Color is amazing
Oh wow! Richard was there cool!  Why take off the tint.  Dayum the windshield is cheaper then on my Ole Porsche 951 S 7:44
bad election of wheels 😢
The green colour is nice 👍
I didn't like the color till I saw the finished product.. love the wheels.. huge fan here from NYC bruv and this one came out beautiful... just a little to many flames at the end ;D
Only thing id change is the wings to be colour matched (appart from the vents of course) and maybe the white on the wheels a diferent colour
I like everything else but the wheels
Sorry but the colour and the wheels are awful.
The car doesn't likes the rims and quits 😂
That looked like expensive smoke.
Love the wheels… kinda looks like Stradmans Aventador wheels.
Love the car it looks similar to matt_wilsz 720s
Unreal content an always humble, your a credit to humanity 👏
Love the work love the all time positivity ! Keep up the great work absolutely loving it
I'm maybe one of the few that totally dislike the color and also the black carbon fiber over the top of the front fenders to me throws off the paint scheme of the body. The wheels are definitely nothing I would design for it. But, to who's their own especially the owner. That's all that matters. I always respect Mat's builds and what he can do.
@Mat hey man am watching in SA the right pipe its a bit inside than the left..love your channel wish we could meet 💌
Any new news about Audi rs6?
Experience is a lifetime of mistakes 😂
@MatArmstrongbmx, don’t bother importing it to the UK, just raffle it to it’s home country 😉
❤❤❤😊
The best built Mclarens are rebuilt Mclarens, the factory quality is awful, no 2 are the same. But Mat those wheels...
You have made it beautiful and I like it. You can pick me up for a ride
The colour is a W
So close.....................................yet so far!
Man just turnt a piece off crap in to a absolut ART  HECKING LOVE THIS BUILD MAT
Engine very VERY bad
was going all good but those wheels ruin it!
Love the car, great build as always! I will have to pass on the wheels, looks like old white wall wheels from the fifty’s.
Matt that looks absolutely sick 😍😍😍
Damn i loved that car so much...Not a big fan of the CF Mods but thats just personal preference :P Btw just a lil thing: idk why Porsche called it "Deckel" but the correct german term would be Motorhaube. Deckels are used to close containers in general but we usualy dont use the term for car hoods :D
1940s whitewall tyres. Not for me, but the rest looks ace.
Matt, can you please think about a retro restoration?... because the _window into door_ mechanism on the BMW Z1 needs to be made famous again
*saw colour.... no no no no no  *10 minutes later.... yeah I can dig that....
hahaha! your dad man... I'm pretty sure you could give him devastating news of any kind and he'd be like ...".... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA".... and I mean that in the nicest possible way. It's the cheat code for life that..laugh your way through it... *ok emoji*
Hmm Jimmy Broadbent will be after that!
Those wheels... no sorry not for me but well done on the rebuild. Hope the engine is ok
Bro i hope you dont regret any of your decisions
In Germany we dont say Deckel its Motorhaube.
Looks amazing that smurfmobile
Love the Mclaren, another car back from the dead
The wheels really finish it off nicely proppa beautiful car
Anyone who knows the name of the track at 12:40? Sounds dope, but have not been able to find it with Shazam. Thanks in advance :)
We actually call it (hood / bonnet) "Motorhaube" (translated word by word it would be somthing like "enignehood") - the word "Deckel" is a more general term for some sort of topper (it can also be used to refer to a bottlecap or the lid of a jar), so I suppose "Deckel" also works, but I'm not sure if everyone would understand what you are talking about if you werent holding a bonnet in your hands.
I think you've put too much oil in it again Mat.....Love that pearl Spearmint colour....Not sure about those rims though, kerb rash magnets for sure....🤔🤔😏🇬🇧
Matt, this is like 'the emperor's new clothes' those wheels look like Shite!, nobody around you will tell you. You've sounded yourself with yes men. Loving your content
The moment the minty fresh got revealed, that thumbs up got stomped
Paint the lettlers of the weels in white as the ring so it look how big the weels are, cause the white ring make them smaller. Tell me what u think! my best wish for the engine!
nice wheels but i lobe the oem
Holy mother of god. This thing looks insane!
Amazing. Fav super car without any doubts
the wheels ruined it
how to win in your raffle
Well its a "head turner" that's for sure .
Lego wheels 😂
awful colour and wheels.
youre dad is my dad!! thanq from a subscriber!
why dont you use the old windshield
this car is sexy as f
I think it looks great 😀😀 good luck fixing the engine problem 😬🙏
I don't know about others, but that's a car with my kinda tastes!! Especially the alloys 🤩🤩
Love the colour!!!! Well chosen sir! It look extremely fast 💨 😅
Car Colour sweet , wheels not doing it think it's the white
Looks good, can you do the white band on the wheels ORANGE like the inside!!!
Oh no. Hoping an easy fix.
Hey Mat, great Job , as any of yours. The spelling "Deckel" in German is not right for the Bonnet. Normaly colloquial it is a "Motorhaube" or just "Haube"
Yeah i'll be honest with you brody them wheels is horror,no hate,I just don't like em
in german its named Motorhaube
We say ,,Motorhaube" and not ,,Deckel" here in Germany man 😂
The fake arch and hood vents aren't a good look imo, but it's your car boss and the rest of it looks unreal. White calipers must happen!
Nah Mat is a legend wow
Sorry hate the colour and the wheels
The color! 🩵
Paint the aero discs minty colored!
mat should continue using the sea shanty for background music...
They call it Haube, not Deckel. A Deckel would be a lid.
@mattarmstring Just received my Matt Armstrong addition YFood. Doing my bit for your channnel, plus potentially winning the carbon ceramic disc would be cool!!!
Car looks great with the wheels and colour looks fresh out of a tron movie
Nice body color ❤ Wheels 👎
Love the color, love the wheels!!! Hope the engine makes it. Well done MA
We don’t call it “deckel” as German, we call it “Motorhaube”😂
This is without doubt the best looking car you've ever put together. Off the charts. Love it. Everything about it
It's just the wheels that need to go😭😭
I'm not gonna lie,  I didn't like the wheels util you put it on the car.. It goes perfectly with the color and the body kit.. well done!
When you say bolts, do you mean screws?
yeah that is a smooth motor....nice...
Matt can you make my 2015 Audi s4 look & sound mint please 😊
Another mint rebuild
Won’t the registration from the replacement TUB be this builds registration no that of the original crash damaged one ?
Car looks mint, that colour did grow on me while watching the episode. Wheels are pants tho. They look like whitewalls 😂.
Well, in the USA, this color was widely used on just work trucks in the 60’s. Not very appealing, but definitely different.
The fenders should have been in car color aswell😂 plus the wheels look terrible at least make the white pieces mint or something. Or put on the original ones they look 10x better
Mat, The car really looks fantastic, but I'm not sure about the color of the rim of the wheels... But it is personal. Still good work!💪👊
clickbait lol
Love it. Car looks absolutely Mint 👌
the rims are the same design like stradmans on his aventador lol
Ok Mat! I will try your limited edition Yfood 😂 you've drilled it into my head enough in these videos hahaha. If I end up winning the disc that thing is getting made into a clock and going in my garage 😎
I love the mods you do man, reminds me of need for speed back in the day. Adding every upgrade you unlock 😂
That wheels, am i only one who dont like it?😢
them wheels the outer trim you should have done the mint the white just does not go the car looks incredible then ruined by the white other than that its a sick job
Hi Matt hope you is well. I’m sure I watched a video of you getting to drift a Nissan gtr indoors, I was telling a friend about it but now I can’t seem to find it anywhere??
I see dads got a nice new kettle haha. Fair play man 😊
The 6 bottles of the limited edition yfood showed up today. Looking forward to giving them a try.
a door seal is not on Maclaren's only  lol all cars have them
Car is mint wheels are 🤮 sorry
Why do you always choose the most horrible wheels for your builds 😂
Lova your pops
That Mat has to be the most amazing car I have ever seen re built. Those wheels. are "mind blowing"  That colour Minty Green just looks awesome and fits the car just right. Question?   .. What was wrong with the engine as the ending says all good no problems ? I really want some of those wheels !!!  Got to be the best build you have done.  Great work simply I'm blown away.
"Engine very bad"  You need a shirt with that on.
What is that song playing when you reveal the alloy wheels?
What have you done with the alloy wheels not a good look
its the same colour as Tavarish's 720
First stradman and now u bro what is wrong with u dude
Well you sure accomplished something…you made the worlds ugliest McLaren.  But hey, I applaud you for the great work with mostly parts and shear determination to get this back on the road.
What a video! Quality of the production increases every time!
These wheels are hideous if u'd ask me! Yet if that's your style it's still sickkk!
Why isn’t the white ring on the wheels in that minty fresh colour? That would look great i think
Is the smoke because the engine oil is still overfilled?
that's definitely a tasty super car. 👌
That is why shouldn't own a mclaren because it's unreliable 😂😂😂😂
Ayyy 🔥🔥🔥 been waiting on this vid for so long fam. Whats that beat at 13:22 though????? Anyone knows??
My only thought is why not Match the wheels to the paint Matt
You are the best man!😊
10:31 the audio is overlapping
Maybe stop messing with exhausts on hypercars.. bad for the neighbourhood as well.
This is my GTA car
You don't seem to have much luck with engine's 😮.
Apart from the wheels, I love it!
The wheels are going to be a nightmare to clean
Your „Deckel“ is a „Motorhaube“ in German✌️😂 keep going with your videos, youre the most interesting youtuber atm
Hey Matt, I've really never had to comment since all your builds have been amazing even the Mclaren is a great funcking job mate. 😂please don't hate me😂however, rims look very great just not with the white man and somehow looks like a hotwheels car. And I looove carbon fiber, but Mat😂 my good friend, don't you think is to much carbon in the front with the wings and the bonet.... I TOTALLY LOVE the car is amazing and the color looks AMAZING no words to describe it mate. Is just the wheels and that carbon is killing me😂. But hey like I saw in other comment and is true, as long as you like it that's what matters. Love your work and I'll never hold tired of seeing your videos, they're just amazing! Thanks for sharing your journey!
You're right. People will hate those wheels... Myself included.  IMO they look like absolute crap.  HOWEVER, that doesn't mean a damn thing. If you love them, thats all that matters.  I'm genuinely happy for you, it's a fantastic car, built exactly as you want it and you can't ask for anything more than that. Bravo Zulu.
wheel trims need to be body colour i think but looks awesome!!!
Minty blue and carbon looks bangin', the wheels are "individual" which is a nice way of saying gopping.
Amazing result, beautiful colour…. Soooo look forward to these vids now, but the white on the rims…..  Naaaaa! The rims should be more open to show off the disks, callipers and engineering…. 😏😕👏🏼😋
Mat your dad is so wholesome! love seeing his joy and smile and laugh!
I hated the wheels sorry mat 😅😅
Dont like new wheels button 🙂
My gran had a bathroom suite that colour. Wheels are godawful
Cars Absolutely “MINT” Mat but the wheels take something away from it for me 😂 each to there own tho mate keep smashing it 👌🏼
First time him saying spoiler instead of wing
Sorry, the polo mint wheels just look shite…. Makes it look like a Little Tikes kids toy car… remove immediately 🥸
You have done a really burning hot mint rebuild. Love your dad and his jokes.   One question: Your reference to the Deckel means if the X-Mas-Deadline failed you're atleast pushing for Car-Freitag in Germany now? :D
T R O N… just thought I’d leave this here for you guys.
Hey buddy same smoke I had on amg a45 Turbo is full of oil so you will need to change it and clean exaust of smoke. Cheers
I never comment but it hurts my german heart. "Deckel" is something like a lid of a bottle. The bonnet is "Motorhaube" which roughly translates to "engine cover". Anyways, keep up with the great videos!!! lots of love from germany
Umm no 🙄😂😂😂 but great job
Tony pepperoni
That is absolutely stunning, McLaren is at the top of the list for me 🤙🏿
Mat, Tony, and Hannah and crew.... Some supercars catch fire 🔥 because of after market exhaust or it a problem with the cooling system or there's a fuel leak near the exhaust or maybe wiring touching metal??? Mat l hope everything is OK because that car deserves to be seen on the road....soon...
It is a Motorhaube not a Deckel but close
you are living my dream Mat! inspirational!
The color and those wheels. so pretty.
Germans dont say "Deckel", they say "Motorhaube"...
minty fresh.  and polo minty wheels too.
Honestly this is one of the cars you have done and the colour is perfect
Looks like something out of Tron with those wheels
100% the motors cooked. its very common with them
i like the colour and bodykit. but the wheels white edge in combination with the cars colour is reminding me of the ice cream van
Love Mat and his work, but I think he must have gone temporarily insane with those wheels. Worst wheels I've ever seen on anything, and I'm not even exaggerating
IT'S NOT A TRAILER!!!
its haube in german, deckel is like a cap of a bottle
Paint the outer part of the rims ORANGE
Wheels like this look good on Stradman's full carbon aventador but with the bright color and bright wheels idk... could look killer without the white border
I would love to to see those white accents on the wheels in mint green! Well done on an epic build! Absolutely awesome car!
You need to get some custom sneaks to match it for when you walk home after blowing it up.
Matt you even laugh when the car on fire, your mad man ha ha.
Beast mode
"Or deco if you are german"... in Germany we call it: Motorhaube 😂😂😂
Broccoli
Where's the rs6 I've been waiting to see it back on the road
I love the bodykit and the paint combination, the wheels... not so much. Too bad about the engine very bad part, hope it's a easy fix.
It’s seriously looks like the car from ‘Tron Legacy’ love it mate
This build is Mint 🙌
Good job mate but the new whles of the McLaren are a little off the factory ones make it a little better how is with me😅
What’s the brand used in the video to seal the side skirts etc? Looks like UPOL: Tiger Seal🤔
yeah i see what you were going for but it just doesnt work, if you painted the car white the wheels would work and the contrast would be nice
Good
I usually like everything Mat does but those wheels…. Epic fail!
The car looks like a pair of sneakers. You should get matching sneakers.
Eating oil engine?
Looks like Stevie Wonder chose the colour scheme!! Looks a right mix up n mess. As for the they look like cheap Japanese crap off a Datson 😢😢😢😢😢
The best lucking one.
Don’t you have to rough up the paint where you glued on that splitter
Matt i have to say every car you have done i absolutely love but i hate this color. But its still a McClaren so i guess the color.doesnt matter
Those wheels really put the whole picture together, I love it great job fam!!
It‘s „Motorhaube“ nicht „Deckel“ 😄
I love the car and the video keep going with the good work 😊
I love the wheels and this build! It's like something straight out of Cyberpunk! Sorry about your engine! :(
Mashallah brother realy good👍🏻
Didn’t realize bead lock wheels was a style for sports cars these days. Interesting. Not sure how I feel about that yet. I do like them on my truck so…
Colour yes yes , wheels big no.
Colour yes yes , wheels big no. Don't work
This is what an Artist called a Masterpiece
Na matt take the white bits of the wheels!!!!
I've noticed as the videos go by the less and less to nothing we see the board of costs and staying within budget to do these projects. That element was always interesting but now it seems the channel is so profitable that it's no longer an issue and it's simply rebuilding super cars irrespective of cost.
1 commercial every 3-4 min…wtf?
I think what you do is amazing and love your videos but honestly why why why that awful colour? Would look better in flames tbh
Horrible wheels
Love the colour! The wheels look like old school whitewalls so almost given the whole car a rat rod modern vibe. Not sure on the front fenders not being colour coded mint though
Love the color and carbon bits, hate the wheels. Looks like it has giant white wall tires on it. Hope the motor isn't toast. Eagerly awaiting the verdict.
Those wheels ruin the looks of that car.  Looks way better with the old ones on it hands down. What a disappointing finish to an epic build...
Looks good
fantastic job car looks great
blown turbos
Woah, sick color. Love it.
mans got tase
Matt, nice work rebuild.  Great work, the car looks amazing… less the wheels.  As you said, 50/50, for me, the car lost.  However, an amazing build and always tuned to more videos.   Keep your amazing journey! You deserve it!!
Rim trim in aqua?
Love the body colour but the wheels?  Look like white walled tyres, on a McLaren?!
Damn that sucks what happened at the end. I think the color looks nice and the kit. Would be nice if you split the color by the hood area so the kit flows nicer
W channel ✌🏼💪🏼
The wheels 😂😂😂😂😂
Wheels ruined it, everything else is 10/10
Color looks sick best rebuild yet, in my opinion
Color is amazing and minty fresh!  Carbon kit too.  Wheels... not so much.
@MatArmstrongbmx just for your info, but the bonnet is not called Deckel in German. Deckel is a lid. Bonnet is called Motorhaube.
Is the suspension suspending? yes. >genuine laughter
Waiting for your long full build videos. Loved them
Perfection 👌😎
I'm 50/50 on the weels, almost look like white walls.
I think if you change the silver on the wheels to teal it’ll really pop.
I am a fan so i wont say anything about the colour lol. Much love!
Love the channel and always look forward to the new release, tried to buy the yfood, and enter the competition, but no shipping to canada!!!!
Hey Mat great buildings you have... I love to se your videos. The only recommendation I give you is paint the white ring of the new wheels in minty color and the car would look much better... Keep on building cars... And what happen to the Audi?
Can you show Freddy how it’s done? Dude is still editing his own videos…. Y’all bought this car and rebuilt it faster than the P1
I would obviously never buy a car with that color, but the combination of every thing is perfect and I like it so much. From someone who only likes boring all black cars.👍
Should go full exposed carbon body with champagne coloured wheels 😍
The car looks incredible super cars are meant to be ridiculous and cool
Thought the wheels looked pump then seen them on the car and love them.  Makes the car look like its from tron!
Your dad sold me on the Y Food lol love it 😂
Wheel fail.  Can’t sugar coat it, I’m usually 100% onboard w your style choices.
A car collection video would be sick!
The wheels look like shit
Bro those wheels go super hard with the teal colour and carbon kit. Looks like a beast
Nice one guys with getting the 720s finished! You need to bring this to the next Drivetribe live event in June now! Please 🙏🏻
Tron with those alloys damn!
Nice choice of color. You have the orange accent on the seats. Orange calipers. How about some orange accent lighting. Halos in the headlights or accent led surrounds. Then led accent across the back. If your sticking with orange and not changing or adding white to the interior to match the wheels.
Stradmans wheels
Reminds me of the Tron movie wow ! It just looks awesome !!
29:17 looks like a tron racer
I love it😍😮‍💨
Excellent build & awesome colour choice .. but the white wall tyre effect makes the wheels look overall smaller? 😳
Ohh Matt, that click when parts just fit, is such a satisfying sound. 😊 thanks for your can do attitude, your innovation and creativity.
Colour, carbon, everythihg is proper mint! Great job! Just wondering though - are the white parts on the rims detachable? They seem to look like rim protectors and give the illusion the wheels are smaller. Aside from those, this car has got to be right up there in status! Amazing build - enjoyed every minute of this from the start! Thanks guys!
get yfood to America
Colours nice.........not sure of the wheels.  no deffo dont like wheels
F.Y.I. Hate thoes wheels and the orange in the seats should have been changed to the new body color.  I really appreciate the work you your dad and crew do .  🇺🇸
The wheels just ruin the car. Sorry
First saw the wheels, thought wank, but after the fire they are looking better lol
What is the name of the exit song and what is the name of the person or group that sings it.
10:25 I thought I was having a schizophrenic attack lol
Hopefully not to serious
Love the car and the colour but not them wheels!
Is @tavarish on the way already?
Midnight purple paint would have been a killer paint job for this🤤
Car is great and stuff,... but the wheels? Look terrible imho..... but nice video, best part as always, your Dads humor ^^
The ending 😭💀💀
Does anyone know if you can get the Yfood drink here in Australia 👍🏼  That car looks amazing in this colour well chosen Mate 👌🏻 another perfect build
Love the car colour but the white on the wheels makes them look awful. Like toy wheels
Грандиозная работа ! Даже без двс она шикарна !
Engine very bad 😳😳😳 love the spec tho 🔥
Those wheels are not it 🥲
Great build and an interesting colour. The wheels need to be Minty as well because to my eyes the white is too much.  Fingers crossed for the engine.
Matt, Colour combo and wheels for some odd reason work, You are making it look to easy, Lets hope the engine hasn’t given up the ghost. Keep it up
Love every car you do & same with this McLaren but those wheels man yakkkkk 🤦🏼‍♂️
You said Christmas... but you didn't say of which year. So, you're still on time 😜
Dude, I love your work, saw almost every video, the car looks insane… but those wheels have nothing to do with the car. On another car maybe, not that one.  It’s my first comment in your channel:  Please change the wheels, you will get tired of them quick…
Your dad working on the car with a Rolex is crazzzzzzy lol😂😅
Bro made his gta t20 looks sick tho keep it up ❤
Mat, for your next video, COFANO is bonnet in Italian ❤
Lovely colour, prefer the standard macaroni wheels. But car looks mega regardless. Congratulations sir.
Quality matey is always good to be different and not worry about what other people think,your car your taste 👌🏻
German for hood is Motorhaube mate😊
New shoes   And nowhere to go
Sorry Matt; love this build but wheels ruin the look 😂😢
Vtuned had a bent maclaran hing and it broke on him due too the weight of the door. Good idea to buy a new one.
The orange and mint colours together look exactly like Volvo R, which is cool!
I just wanna see Matt’s credit rating as he spends like a millionaire lol
Looks like one of those cool Peugeot's from a few years back.                                                                                                                             Joke obvs
You are are Mazing Mat
Mat you are very lucky to have your Dad working with you like this. Good to see you guys having so much fun!
The wheels look like Polo Mints . . which is appropriate considering the colour.
oh man what a great colour ,hope sort engine .
Awesome as usual, guys at Wheelmania are refurbing my wheels because of you, might have to change for new ones now. Keep up the good work.
Colour is not for me or the wheels  Great video tho  We need more videos please 🙏🏼
Wow not even 2 mins in and you already got adverts in your video. Talk about selling your respect
I love your videos so much but those wheels on that car are the worst thing I’ve ever seen!…
This episode was that good I watched it twice.  Superb!
For once i have to disagree with the wheel choice .. Definitely a no no on them
Jimmy broadbent would be impressed
18:02 its Motorhaube not Deckel in german
Omg this is my all time favourite colour! Tiffany blue! Matt pls let me know what do you call it? Absolutely stunning mate congratulations
That suspension fluid machine is like automotive equivalent of kidney dialysis
The Colour and carbon kit looks nice just the alloys are not the one
Substandard ending Mat where was the peace out 😉
Kinda looks like stradman’s exposed carbon aventador pink wheels
Love the colour, but not struck on the wheels.
Great color!! I’m 39yrs and at my age, painted rims isn’t my thing: But I understand you did it “your way” Happy for you
Love you guys, but sorry Matt, those wheels are terrible. I reckon an all white design would like good 👍
In German the bonnet is actually called „Motorhaube“ not „Deckel“ btw
Mat is HIM frl 🔥
Looks like it has white walls
Incredible build! Can’t wait for the next video
SpaceShip❤
Matts this color is just awesome excellent choice Mat
Watching the yfood advert, as an American with a Midwest accent I attempt to say “banana” as Mat says it
A really enjoyable video, thank you so much.
Hey Mat, I absolutely love the color you chose for the car! It really stands out and gives it a unique look. And I agree, it's refreshing to see a supercar in a bright color rather than the usual dark tones. Keep up the great work, looking forward to more exciting content from you!
Them wheels killed it. Nice car though 🔥 well done 👏
Heard that ... itch pop.. damm🤦🏾‍♂️
Just noticed you got those YouTube plagues on your workshop….nice🔥
Love the car but I don’t know about them wheels . Good job mate 👍👍
I am nit sold to the color and the wheel but the important thing is that you love it. The rest is not ours to judge. Great vid as always
beautiful rebuild but that is why I will never own a Mclaren or one of their garbage engines. Only Porsche for me.. Epic job putting it all back together none the less.
I’ve been following Matt from the pandemic and I think it’s time to try a y food. Is it sold in America??
Stunning finish...and as you say.... one of a kind....
the rims instead of the white should be paint matched to the mint would look much better
Them wheels 🙈😂
Matt….. come on I normally love your taste in wheels and colours but I really think you’ve got it wrong this time, I’m thinking the white should have been mint green body colour to tie it all together …. The white just looks odd….  Hoping it looks better in person  And hope the smoke is just where it’s been sat for a while….  Finger crossed
Wow you guys never stop amazing me 🤩🤩 Wow what a fantastic build
It's awesome...hopefully only oil burning off
TO BE HONEST I PREFER THE OEM WHEELS IT HAD THE BLACK ONE SUITS HER GOOD, AGAIN PERSONAL OPINION
Fair play to ya Mat, living your best life. Haters going to hate. I love the wheels, BTW.
Please please take off the white wheel trim....
Loved watching this build and the others. Car sounds amazing BUT the wheels ruin it. IMO of course
.. inspiration in RR4 Playstation  .. ?🤩👍🍻
Straight out of a GTA V lobby hahaha looks incredible though, great content as always!
Colour looks great but not with the orange interior.
the hood is calld motorhaube in german not deckel btw
I've tried those drinks, and they are awful. The after taste is disgusting
Great work Matt & team but those wheels are gash I'm afraid....
Love Matt, love the channel, love the car but those wheels aren't right
The wheels are really ugly. The previous ones were a lot better..
Is yfood available in the U.S.?
I don’t get it. Is the car ok or not? Strange ending of the video there 😢
everytime ... 🤮🤦
You copied Stradman's wheels. And the white part should be pink on your car as well! It's not too late...
these wheels ruined the look of the whole car!!! Pity😢
Wich apps do you use for cars?😅
I've seen videos of reviews of brand new Mcclarens and the body panels not lining up and the build quality not that good
For me personally those wheels spoilt the build
Best car ever build by mat. Absolutely insane!!!!!!!
Love the car, it looks sick! But those wheels ruin it, they are horrible lol
Love it
Looks like you’ve got white walls on that McLaren
I'm a sucker for that colour of mint green.. I'd paint the world in it. Not 100% sold on the wheels but they could be a grower
How many broken McLaren we still need for everyone to understand that those cars are absolute garbage
Can we get a garage tour on the second channel
looks out of this world bro wtf, that car is amazing
A German here: it's not! Deckel! It's Motorhaube. Bonnet means Motorhaube in German. Deckel is not right
Hey Mat  Its Motorhaube in German
Love watching your channel, not keen on the colour 🤔 but as long as you like it that's all that matters. I must say I prefer your new Porsche that's the nuts.👍
LOVE THE WHEELS!!!
Those wheels, really...
Absolutely loving this series! Thank you Mat! I can't wait to get home from work, every time you upload.
My personal opinion on the wheels, I dont like the white trim it's so bulky and doesn't match anything else on the car. But congratulations Mat on this dream come true❤️
We need ''Engine very bad'' merch
Paint the fenders mint but leave the louvres carbon. Paint the rear wing mint.  Paint the rim guards mint. 😊 nevertheless what a fantastic job on this build. Loved every video of it! Hope not to much trouble with the engine.
Brooooooooo 😢😢😢
Mat would put carbon fibre bodykit on a batmobile
Carbo fibaaaah
Shocking choice of wheels, ruins the whole build imo
Hey my friend how you doing? I ordered some of that drink you towed and I think so they don't ship to the US thank you
Did you need to drop the engine?
Love you guys... but... those wheels...
THAT COLOUR COMBO IS SICK WITH CARBON!!!!!!!!!!
Wheels are great they remind me of the white wall the classic cars had on their tyres but this is a morden version of it. It isn't for everyone but most definitely is very unique love what you have done matt absolutely something different please please i hope it isn't bad news for you with the engine it would be too painful to watch
Mat wow once again you and your team have smashed it not to sure about the colour mate or the wheels but it dose look like something from the film 80st Tron and that was a cool film..! Top work
Wheels in the white are off putting to say the least. Great design wrong paint. Rest of car looks super.
Beautiful except for the rims.
The white on the wheels should be mint lol ;)
The Mclaren gave you its own finger for putting on such horrendous wheels - Colour and body Kit were looking sick until the wheels man!!!
The rims are not it lovely vid tho
Love the colour, the wheels not so much, betting you’ll end up changing them back to something that properly befits the car. Great work otherwise 👍🏼
Rims look horrible, but the car looks really really good, great work
Amazing video, awesome colour, love the wheels ❤
The wheels are perfect but not for McLaren 😢
18:06 in germany er say :“ Motorhaube „😂
That MCLAREN looks so sick!! Love it. What a monster
It looks like something from Tron with those wheels on😂. Class video as always Mat.
ENGINE VERY BAD
Am so happy for you Mat my eyes are watering watching your video
Looked better crash damaged
You guys keep amazing me! I love the cars you build. Not really a fan of some of the stuff you do to the cars, but beautiful work nevertheless ❤
Great job from the US. Hope the fire isnt a big deal car looks insane. One favor if im allowed.. can you go help Tavarish finish the P1. Kidding of course great job guys
Good luck passing inspection with that exhaust 🤩
Love the colour, hate the wheels, sorry, however you’re still a genius ✅
loved the baby blue rear wing!
color is fine but wheels are hideous!
I know it’s sacrilegious to paint raw carbon but the fenders would look great body coloured. Keep up the good work!
Enjoy your build videos a ton but that color is not my taste, one step up from seafoam green. 🙃
Hopefully not another engine that got detonated and is leaking coolant(white smoke from exhaust) into the cylinders.
Wheels look cr@p
good video BUT I hate the colour. 😢
Another fantastic build.....not sure about the wheels though!
Everything is perfect but wheels :) But hey, it's your toy. Looks sick. Hope the engine is not completely dead :(
Mat and the team… that looks mint, literally mint man
I love your builds, I love the 720s, but not crazy about the carbon front quarter panels or wheels, but love the color
You made a Volvo-Style McLaren Flash Green Atacama 😂
Germans don’t say „Deckel“, we say „Motorhaube“ 😅
Looks incredible
Got my first order of yfood in the ltd edition can not wait to try these as a sprayer it's hard to find time to sit and eat there is always something waiting for paint hahaha loving the vids Matt and popps now just hope I win the disk hahahahha😊
In Germany we say "Motorhaube" for Hood/B...
Hit us with a collection update video Mat! Great work as per
Steps to repair a mclaren 1. Buy a carbon fiber tub 2 buy a new engine 3 put them together
Paint those rim rings the same mint color and it'll be absolutely perfect.
Just so Tavarish about dodgy engines in a Mclaren
Ive been waiting to see what happens to the McLaren, only for the engine blow😥😥..watching from South Africa🇿🇦
so sick!!!
How to turn a beast of a fuel burning vehicle into something that looks like it runs on milk float batteries, it was looking sooo good until you put the spaz wheels on it. 😭
Thing looks like it should be in the Tron movies 🫶
Oh, wow, whitewall wheels. 2020's take on the 1950's?
I'm torn on the wheels. They are deff unique, but the white part makes it look like the old 50's whitewall tires. Meh
TRON
Wheels are terrible 😢
Looks like Tron
wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I hope the engine just quick fix.  Great colour and great work. Good luck matt  Thank you for the great contents.  Wait to see what the outcome on the engine   And also the outcome if the audi in the USA.
Car very good. Video very good. Engine very bad.
That paint nd carbon look awesome,the wheels are like summat out of Tron,definitely a grower like
What a trip
Since it's a Dutch one, it's pronounced 'motorkap'
Not a fan of the wheels BUT its personal taste, so if you love them thats cool.
Car looks awesome, love the color and carbon kit is fire.  Not hating but you lost me on the wheels.  Keep up the good work love watching the video from one gear head to another.
“We’re on fire” *proceeds to leave it on and rev it*
Looks amazing. Good job 👏🏼 those rims are 🔥
Have ordered my shakes! 👍
I think it self destruct when it got the new wheels on (read with love 😉)
We actually say Motorhaube in Germany. Deckel is fine though.
Great video, but these wheels are atrocious
Its Not Deckel its called Motorhaube
well bad news is there is most likely cross threaded lug nuts on now. but otherwise that car looks and sounds amazing
Orange and blue Gulf style, awesome look
Welldone Mat and team. Car looks insane. Not a fan of the wheels. Would look epic if white aero disc was removed. 😎🇿🇦
00:7   When Matt gives it the welly there is a trail of smoke from the exhaust, blown turbo or a blown piston, another strip down on the way.....
Probably the fenders would look much better painted in body color🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻❤️
Love the colour hate the wheels, not that Matt will ever see this but i think the original wheel powder coated in white with orange accent on the spokes would have been class on it ,then again what do i know 😅
Love the colour, just not sure on the carbon front wings. That said, what an incredible build.
Sweet ride. The wheels…….. not so much.
I usually have a happy banana in the morning 🍌
What do you think about painting the top of the front Wings in mint and leave the open bits with exposed carbon ? I think that would be the perfect Kombination! What a great build overall. Congrats Mate !
Color 👍 , wheels 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Hats off to you - those wheels are sick, goes well with the mint
I wonder if that’s a head gasket with all the smoke. Car looks great.
Hood in german is Haube not Deckel  Gruß Joneses from soest
the wheels are mental!
Great car well done but the wheels are a no for me spoils the look
Jimmy Broadbent approved this colour! 😂
Looks great but imo the bonnet and 2ings need to be painted 👌
Should have put it in orange like on the seats ... overall very good work Matt, dad n the whole crew 😊
Change the colour of the wheels
Love the colour of the minty fresh - the wheels  - not so much
I think the white bits on wheels should be that same colour as car
Build is surreal. Never thought it would come to this especially with the CF. This would turn heads and imprint into anyone's minds!
why didn't you TURN IT OFF WHEN IT WAS ON FIRE?!
Please, not Deckel. It's Motorhaube.
I lose some respect for u mat that wheels that copy of stradman full cardon fider aventedor
Minty...! I love it...!!!!
Deckel if you're German🤟🏻😂
Whoaaaaaaaa. Love the colour and carbon, but attaching buttons instead of wheels😂 I think the issue in my eyes is them being two tone, a remedy would be painting them all white. Thus giving it a proper Miami Vice look. 👌
It is looking  sweet
Love the colour and body kit. Wheels... Look to small imo.
Love your vids and nice build i like watching you Mat but you have a great team and you should give them more screen time they are awesome 50% Mat an 50% team
Nice coulors
Looks great!! I think you should paint the front fenders body color and leave the louvres carbon and paint the white on the wheels body color also. Great job. You practically built a McLaren like the factory does.
Mats dad has the Jokers type of laugh🤣🤣🤣😂😂
I honestly hated the wheels the first time I saw them but they look pretty sweet on the car tbf 👌
Mat that color is absolutely sick. My man this is the best color I've ever seen on any car. Wow you have really knocked this one out the park. Great work to you and the crew.
Love it all apart from the wheels. They are terrible imo. All black  without the white would look so much nicer, makes the wheels look small. But as you say each to their own taste. Love watching you guys keep up the good work and let Tony pick the next set of wheels 😉🙌
Allllll this work and then the wheels… terrible choice of selection
@matt armstrong you dad is awesome !!  Those wheels are definitely different, looks like whitewall tires on it.
Been waiting on the final touches on the car, but no fan of the color choise.. sorry!  It takes away the shape and curves of the car imo. Im glad for your sake tho. As long as you like it, thats what matters right? Keep up the good work, its fun to watch you and your whole team solve all problems, and complete the builds. ;) U come a looong way from carpark fixes, to full blown supercar builds.. thats fuckin awsome !! Love from Sweden..
Not sure what translator you used but decal is definitely not a German word for bonnet. 😅
Love the car bro
Smashed it!! Well done Matt and team 🫶
Honestly the build looks incredible.. but those wheels are horrible! 😮 looks like GTA 5 wheels with whitewall tyres. 😢
Personally i think the carbon wings look a little bit of
Think it's time you bought wheel mania 😂
Hahaha thanks for inkluding the germans. But we call thaz a Motorhaube (Engine cover) not a Deckel.
The assembled ass, this car is just insanely beautiful! And good job with the hinge. I was lile "yayy", "noo", "yayy" :D
Those wheels just dont work
Holy crap no way lol these are ugly asfu lol but like you said that’s your car ahah :p
Oh god.. at first glance I really don’t like the wheels lol .. I’m not done the video yet can’t wait to see the end lol
Insane! ❤
I am definitely digging the wheels choice!
Thanks for your vids mate Love it ❤ from Germany
Bro its not "Deckel" its "Haube" in german haha <3
Not a fan of those white parts on the wheels but non the less great job
please mat plaese dont put this in a Rafalle please this car is a keeper
Trash = McLaren
I think stradman did a similar wheel on one of his Lambos
That color!!!! 🎉❤️
Colour is bad, wheels are cool and you and your channel are an inspiration.
Dad is the best ever in this channel👊🏽
secondo il mio gusto quei cerchi hanno rovinato tutto
Sorry Mat. Those wheels are just awful. Still loved the video though.
Mate that’s is one of the sickest cars I’ve seen! The couloir combo is amazing! And it’s one of my favourite cars ever! What a masterpiece you have created there sir!! 🎉🎉
It’s a shame yfood isn’t food, it’s ultra processed shit 😅
In germany we dont say Deckel we say Motorhaube
Great work mat! i do like the colour and the style but not fond of the white on the wheels but it doesnt matter what i think its your's after all.
Nice rebuild,  i don't like soft colours for sportscars and you confimed that once more for me, you can put it on a fiat500 but not on a maclaren.
Love the colour and wheels but the orange interior doesnt quite work
Awesome build!
Great watchable content, full respect for all the hard work 👍. Though I don't like saying but the wheels aren't giving it that wow it deserves
love the build . Finishing very odd , rebuild a worthless reck, then make it look like a worthless  kit car? i dont get it . Bonnet and wheels are hidious, in my opinion. ....
Great job guys...pity it looks like a giant toy side on...hope the fire was not serious
liked this simply because you sampled the wellerman sea shanty :)
oh fuck
Love the colour. Not so keen on the choice of wheels. But, that aside you've done an amazing job!
Absolutely beautiful ❤.
Beautiful and love the carbon kit. No more Audi vehicles for you.
It is not called Deckel it is called Motorhaube.
The wheels IMO not great they look like old school white walls 😂 from a distance  Rest of the the car looks great 👍🏻
It reminds me a Bugatti style without the bugatti lines. The end result is different and interesting. I apprecciate you are doing something different, if everyone would do and like the same style the world would be borying.
It’s Motorhaube… not Deckel :)
Matt, those wheels are really ugly and spoil an otherwise good looking sportscar.
oh man @10:30 your previous video's audio was up 😊
Please take the white out of the wheels so we can see it without!
The colour is very subjective
😃😃😃😃😃
Hey Matt I would love your yfood but tried to order from the website but cant get them in canada :(
Painted wings would make it complete. Please paint them! Haha
It was awesome but those wheels ...gotta say nope IMPO
4:24 looks like another rubber shim should go between the clips
Congrats on the build, very unique, will stand out at every show.   Don't nail/launch/redline a McLaren until fully up to temp tho.
I think that the car would look better if the front fenders were the same colour as the rest of the body panels. Not saying that it looks bad now, but it's just my opinion.
Yo mat I think you should leave the carbon fiber exposed and don’t tune the car because this is the fastest car you have in your garage next should be a Japan maybe a Nissan gtr or a Supra but what I think will make your channel really sky rocket will be if you did a rebuild on an American muscle car back to the McLaren I think it’s beautiful as it is
I thought the car looked fantastic one of the best cars you’ve ever done since I’ve watched you from the beginning, but please please please please please change those alloys. They are shockingly bad. They don’t do nothing for that Car that Car deserves a lot more better wheels. I know you’ve tried something different to make it personal for you, but they don’t look great in my opinion
Love the choices but the front fenders need to be painted leaving the louvre exposed
I thought the car looked fantastic one of the best cars you’ve ever done since I’ve watched you from the beginning, but please please please please please change those alloys.

Fantastic 1 of a kind colour scheme, only a suggestion I think the orange trim on the seats would look cool in white to match the wheels, I wish you all the best sorting the engine, and looking forward to watching your next project
Love your videos and your attitude. I do NOT like that color or the wheels. Sorry Mat! Keep up the good work. Hopefully the engine smoking is nothing major. :(
Love the colour but I think the wings should be the same colour aswell, doesn't flow well with the break in the colour
Mat the car and the colour is the bollocks the wheels nt a fan of
Don’t like the wheels but the car is great
That is gorgeous but the wheels......nah 🤔
The wheels look awful.
That’s @dmodeejays colour looks nice tho 👌
That colour is rubbish mate , but is your choice, you ruin the whole car
Wow, the wheels are truly hideous. On the upside you will have a good chance of winning the Pimp of Year Award 2024. Just make sure wear the hat with the feather in it and the bell bottoms to comlete the look. I am rooting for you, go Mat!
Super ugly wheels 😂
Car looks great, but the wheels have to go! 😁
I know what’s wrong with it   The rims a shite so the engine took its  self out the game 🤣 I’m sorry mat, we’re you high when you designed these 🤷‍♂️🤙
We don´t say "Deckel" we say "Motorhaube"
Tony rocking the Rolex in the garage...lovely to see a tool watch being used properly
A color change on the wheel ring would make it much better, maybe to match the car color.
Nice build! Surprised you didn’t paint the outer part of the new wheels to color match the car instead of the white.
Looks like something out of Tron
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Deckel means just Lid in german, we say Motorhaube to a bonett
I hope you match the wheels to the orange in the interior, that would be sick! No, I haven't watched the whole video yet. :D
I propose to change the check engine icon to the abbreviation EVB (engine very bad) in every new car produced from 2024 :) xD
That's definitely Henna's car.
Nice one Mat...! huge congratulations to you and everyone that involved
Awe mate gutted am interested to know what happened and how you fix it. . ❤
Them wheels🤢🤢🤢
Ugly colour and wheels...creazy how every time the car's finished,  something goes wrong
Car is sick.....rims......try again!
Incredible rebuild. The finish is very definitely 'personal' 🤣🤣
Dude you're so close.. you just need to paint the white on the wheels and the front fenders to match.
That colour is amazing
Mat, your journey from humble beginnings to supercar stardom is nothing short of inspirational! 🌟 Every video feels like a new chapter in an epic automotive saga. The paint job? Grew on me faster than a Formula 1 lap. And those wheels? Controversial, but they add character - just like the white walls of vintage classics. Tony's positivity is the cherry on top, always bringing smiles and good vibes. 🚗💨
i just love how your dad finds humour in every dull moment😅😂😂 keep it up 🎉🎉🎉
Love it with those wheels
McLaren's are shite cars..
Good job .but engine in trouble 😢
Bro, at around 10 minutes and 30 seconds, you have two voiceover audio tracks running at the same time.    Onto the car, it’s looking good. I love that color. The only thing I’m not a fan of. Is that shiny black. I think it should’ve been Matte or semi gloss just looking at all those fingerprints.   I’m not even gonna talk about those wheels
Car is awesome but not a fan of the wheels 🤷‍♂️
I know it’s good for views, but I thought he would’ve learned from the RS6 that going full out in a new build could damage it?
If the front fenders were mint, would compliment the car more.
the wheels are horrid. Way to ruin the look of the car. Looks so cheap and out of place, and the karma punished you for it with the engine smoke.
color looks awesome
Im gonna be honest dude, you make great videos, great repairs, great content but as for color choice, thats just bad.
I tell you that no one is gonna copy that car that carsick one of the coolest McLarens I’ve seen out there❤❤
Shit I quite like the color and wheels. Great job
What could possibly go wrong with a McClaren engine? Ask your mate Freddie….but let’s hope you are not having the Tavarish experience.
Matt  just in case you're thinking of giving this car away, please consider me. I can just imagine the look on my friends faces when I pull up to the Derby & Joan club in it. Owd Fred will be really jealous as it looks a lot better than his moggie thousand. I bet Doris won't like the colour  but she's nearly blind anyway so sod her. Alternatively, you could do the Matt Armstrong treatment on my Suzuki Splash. I reckon it'd look really nice with a bit of carbon fibre bodywork, a 2l turbo charged engine and you could even stick a wing on it ( dont actually know where though) 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The wheels would look better in the body mint colour imho but each to their own of course it's your car! Another fantastic job ❤👍🏼
I watched the video in full last night. Up to a point the car was possibly the most beautiful car I’d seen. Then the wheels ruined it. Ruined it so much that the car committed suicide! Such awful awful wheels. I think you should do a poll to see what your public think.
Fingers crossed for the engine! Hope we will see the 720s soon at good health and ready for the road. Amazing Rebuilt. I'm so happy that I found your channel last summer.
damn those wheels
31:37 literally set on fire?
Epic!!! Awesome col scheme
I hope the hard is good❤
Lol not a fan of the wheels.
Private road ????🤔🤔🤔
Best looking 720s in the world
Looks f*cking awesome
that diffuser kills children in free time.
You had me until those wheels got installed.
Finally someone that painted a supercar in a bright color. FFs a supercar is an event, a toy, a attention grabber. Why super cars come in dark colors is like a funeral. Great color Mat!
Matt!!!!!!! Nooooooo!  Flat black with orange pin strip!  Not turtle turquoise!  Grrrrrrrrrrr!
Sorry mate, wheels are fugly!
its always the old thinkpads from a billion years ago....doing all these important stuff...😂😂
Matt, you are like a kid in a candy shop at Wheelmanie. Love the car. Great job. 👍
Looks great, but I would definitely paint the fenders. Everything else looks sick, good job!
It’s your car and your choice of colours. You’ll not be able to hide/blend in ever.
Giving me flashbacks of some whacky body kits, and colors on Eclipses in the 1990's. Hammond is going to massacre this thing.
The engine coming up again  don't worry the car is alive good work chaps
the wheels look amazing!! Cant believe people in the comments don't like them. Great paint, wheel and orange combo. Well done Matt!
I Like it
Mclaren remotely destroyed it due to stuck on tat and shit wheels 😂
oww noo did u guys pull off a travarish ? She wasn't cold, was she.... when you ripped on  her?? dam guys , no biggy right.. Great gob Job , Matts and his team is KILLING IT!!
Cold Rev'd too heaven : D rip
Please, no more pikey wheels from Wheel Mania 😂
"100% no issue "is the reason why it blew 🤣🤣🤣
It looks like a boy racer got given a Mclaren, OH NO.  Hats off to you for your work effort but let Gordon Murray help next time.
just finish it off with the gulf decals.. please... that will be so cool
the day your dad leaves the "Show", i'm out baby 😂
Wheels with car color looks fuckin awesome..
Its not "Deckel" its "Motorhaube" in German ;)
Can you please buy a blue Ford. It has got back left mirror damage and door🤗
Not my choice of wheels but it’s your car so it’s perfect as long as you like them.  Hope the engine is ok.  Great looking ride.  Good luck.
Absolutely beautiful car. Best in collection for sure.
Big enough now. To stop the lying food products
Colour is *chef’s kiss*
The Hood in German is not Deckel it is: "Motorhaube" or in this case the engine is in the back so it is "Kofferraumklappe" or "Kofferraumdeckel"
Cool car 😀
Audi wheels are the best so far. This one personally i dont like with the white.
Mclaren looks sick🔥🔥🔥 hope engine is not very bad...🙏
Like from movie Tron Legacy. Stuning!!!
Wasn’t sure about the colour of the wheels to begin with, but they have grown on me. Looks like something out of TRON. Great work Guys!
Just wondering how does this vehicle be properly registered after repair?
Looks like a gta car
looks shit mate 👍
I think it looks fantastic. Great job again 🙌
Those wheels are something. The color grew on me though. If the wheels had those inner lighter sections painted to match the paint, they may have looked better. Honestly not a fan of them though.
German its called MOTORHAUBE!
YOU AND YOUR DAD ARE THE GREATEST CAR AUTO REPAIR MAN I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK PLEASE I LIKE WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS MY FRIEND...
love the colour.... but you should do jail time for the wheels!!!😄
SICK!!!!!!!
Minty fresh with polo wheels!
You are an animal bro! car looks amazing
And another episode 😮
Absolutely in love with the mint and those wheels, great choices!
Wow I finally agree with one of ur colour choices fab.  Not sure about the wing tho
And there goes a blown headgasket... probably Anyway, the car looks awesome and it was better to happen while having "controlled" fun than at an inspection.
Not a fan on the wheels 🙈 Paint is awesome!
please dont sell it
It looks absolutely MINT no pun intended the wheels look a bit like white walls from afar but luv the design hope it's something simple and not an engine failure 😭😭
Love everything about the car except the wheels
Matt Armstrong, saint of discarded exotics, your McLaren is absolutely stunning. Best of luck with fixing it. What will the next car be that will have the good fortune to be owned by Matt Armstrong?
Music got ice spice type of feel all i can hear 😂 but great video matt
2:21 Nice
When you were saying some people might like it, some people won't. i thought that would you say " what color is your mclaren's wheels" otherwise at first sight i was like wtf but when they're on 🫠🫠
Gulf Scheme ! I hope so its timeless !
Those white wheels yikes
What is that color from?  anyone know the color code?
I LOVE the colour, and I'm shocked how well the wheels suit the car! Brave brave move, you nailed it Matt
Stop making it look easy x
Wheels gotta go man 🤮🤮🤮
those wheels are so dope imo
Wheels= HORRIBLE
Nah mate the engine is good its just a bit cold init😂
Car is great, but I'm guessing there will be 4 spare white frizbees knocking about soon!
Chrome livery would have look way better
Bye bye piston..........
What a crying shame. I sincerely hope your engine is not toast Mat. 😢
it is not 1 of 1 the stradman
LOL those rims make it look like it has white walls.... Dude your taste is crazy
Ive already orderd my Y-Food so if yoou need my address to send the brake disc let me know 🤪
Um...it kinda looks like an Andies after dinner mint.
Mint ❤
Like the colour but not the wheels.
Loved the build. Hope you were able to sort out the engine issues.
18:03 min : it´s actually "Motorhaube" in german :) great video!
reminds me of when Lightning McQueen got whitewalls.
Maaan, the car looks the Bomb! Amazing! :) Great job as always!
wow miami spec heavy
I think it needs mint green fenders ( wings)
Forget the editing mistake. I'd be more worried about the car lol
take a shot everytime he says "TOB"
Those wheels look so good  Nice taste it look so futuristic👍🏻
Think the wheels would have looked better the same colour as the car, but it did look amazing .Great video as usual
Love the videos, And PS in german hood is Motorhaube. Keep it up
I like the wheels but think the outer rings would look better in the body colour. Keep up the good work Mat
You should do a car meet or show with all your cars 😂
This is an epic build, the paint the carbon and the wheels are spot on 👌🏽👌🏽🔥🔥
It's Motorhaube in german :P
Absolutely stunning, personally would of gone with all gloss black wheels to match everything else, but wow some 1/1 Mclaren 😍😍😍
Wheels 👎, but it is your taste.
become a Christian today!!
Its Motorhaube on german
Another great build Tony 🤣🤣🤣It's ok Matt your dad will fix it. You both have hearts of lions.
Hey Mat.  Are you taking the McLaren to the Nürburgring at carfreitag? 😊🤘🏼
Who else smashes that LIKE button b4 the video even starts😂
love it
In German Bonnet means Motorhaube ;)
Looks great minus the white bolt on things on the wheels
The colour is a big YES !
Well it didn't window the block.  Maybe its just a blown turbo.
Amazing work Matt! Good to see the Hard work !
not a fan of the wheels but well done
I love the paint color and the style of the wheels but I was thinking…. What about making the white wheels orange to match the interior? Could look good or may look terrible
Love the colour and the carbon panels but hate the whitewall wheels!
Paint the white bits black, and those wheels are sorted.
Those wheels look like wheel trims
Ha Ha brilliant; love the ending Matt - what an incredibly unique car, fingers crossed for you
White wheel centre with the mint colour around the rim would have been better I think
We can call it  Mint Tron :)
I've never heard anyone in Germany refer to a bonnet as "Deckel", you would say "Haube".
I think Stradman have similar wheels on his full carbon Lambo.
Pimp ride
love your vids!!
like the color hate the wheels great video
So what about the engine smoking??? is it bad or not? Im curious !!!😬
Oh, no! Those wheels ruin the entire aesthetic! 😢
maybe a change wheels 😊
Yep those white outers like shite but the rest is awesome 👍
Wheels are tragic. Look like whitewall tyres. 🤮
So sick love watching ur channel grow. Always got good taste with colors and designs too never an ugly build
Your dad is brilliant... he is the spitting image of a guy called Rich who works for me and also comes from Leicester!!
Man the way you transformed that car is UNBELIEVABLE!! I love it!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩! the carbon finish, and the wheels look sick!! Although i thought mabe the same menty fresh green instead of the white might make it look better. Just saying 😅
It now looks like a transformer...
The wheels look like TheStrad man’s ones he has on his carbon lambo
Great work Mat, but those wheels 🤦🏻‍♂️
wow wasnt a fan at first but the wheels grew on me,!!! i think a couple more white accents arround the car (or maybe SUBTLE white tron lines) could help bring everthying together more with the wheels.
Great build, not sure about the wheels
in my opinion the wheel surround would have looked better the same color at the mint green instead of white, it just looks like its driving on old school white wall tiers.
You guys are amazing! But those alloys!!! 🤢😂
That's awesome work Mat and the crew
Love the content - 😢 the car is horrendous
Amazing results I’d love to see them white wheel inserts in carbon 👌🏻
You dad is a genius 😂
Another banger vid. But I would love to eventually see you rebuild a JDM car in the future.
Love the car, but the trim around the wheels clash and look like they don’t belong. Painting them black should bring it all together, IMO of course. Love the rest of the choices though. Great job Matt!
Are you going to do another part?
Wheels look sick 👍I really hate when you put gold wheels on cars reminds me of boy racers in the 80's & 90's in there Nova's & Peugeot 305 cheap looking poseurs cars. T these are next level, Colour scheme is wicked 10/10 Top Project . Might want to add some Hots Rod flames down the sides 😂
You said " minty" when you showed the colour,, now you have polo mints for wheels!!
u are living my dream where did u buy all of yours wrecked cars
The wheels make the car ugly and less sporty looking. But the rest of the car is awesome!
Definitely a Tron vibe going on with the wheels and paint. Gotta love something different.
Am I missing something... a minute from the end of the video the smoke from the exhaust seems to indicate there is a problem somewhere in the engine... then with no explanation the video ends with you saying the car is finished perfect with no issues at all.... can someone explain please? Love the paint the wheels and the whole car looks awesome.
17:29 😂😂
i love the kit looks mental❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Love the wheels with the minty color! Tron/spaceship vibes!!!  Also, those last few minutes of the video were hard to watch…. Engine indeed very bad…
what happend at 10:30
the insane fact Mat restored Adam LZs Porch then goes and makes the paint for his newer build nearly the exact same without knowing of Adams new build.
Now that's it's on fire what do we do next?😭😭😭😭
At first the white on the wheels  looked weird to me but now im liking it, looks like a car from Tron
Amazing video Mat as always, its been a great journey for all of us . The colour is spot on and credit to you and your team for all the hard work you've put in.
Windoor screen is cheep we have a coach and one of the is 9k +Vat
Looks sick, hope that engine aint toast tho 😮
Don’t like the wheels. Bud
Great video. I like the wheels, just not the white, if the white bit was carbon, it would look better. The wings have grown on me. Dechrome the McLaren badges and a few more hints of orange. When's it getting tuned?
congrats bro im so proud i wish i could be like you
Great build - wasn't sure about the wheels at first but already growing on me by the end of the video - as for the smoke - didn't that happen to another car of your and it turned out to be an oil overfill?
It looks like a barbie McLaren.  Not my style. But nice build
Wait thats the exact same rim as stradman yours is just white😅.. i guess its the only white one🤷‍♂️
Brakelight: same as in a 911: if the wing is up, the one on the bottom of the rear windscreen does not work and vice versa.
beautiful
Brilliant as ever.... whats happened to the old E24 Barn Find? Its been quiet for a year???
Those wheels are gangster I just hope he doesn’t have to put them on a car with a good motor
Pimp my ride vibes
It‘s Not „Deckel“ in german it is „Motorhaube“
Me have some happy Banana Y Food, yummy 😊 oh and the car looks fecking mental!!
Love the wheels
🔥🔥🔥🔥.. You’ve outdone yourself on this one✅
Colour is insane but the wheels fully let it down 😢
I like the paint job a lot, the wheels I like at a distance, less so close up, have a feeling it’s one that will grow the more I saw, plus when it drives
I think that’s one of the most beautiful McLaren I’ve seen. So nicely done Mat!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The car ❤. The wheels 🤮
MATT!! The car looks ab-so-lute-ly amazing!! love the color combination and the wheels are perfect! Hope the engine issues are minor and get solved quickly.
That mint is FIYA!!!! Amazing job man!
Love the back end
Not Deckel. It is „Motorhaube“ in german
🔥🔥🔥
That’s sick
The wheels for me are hit or miss. I’m not sure off the white on the McLaren might be worth colour coding them to the car.  A lot like what stradman did with his carbon wide body Lamborghini
Lambo, Avant and now this one, Matt can you please not kick their heads in as soon as you get them running, give the thermostat a chance!
Them wheels are MINGING 😞
Why are the supercar engines so unreliable? First Tavarish and now you have a blown Mclaren engine!
Paint actually looks nice, but i would  some different wheels. Anyways an awsome build mate, much respect and keep doing this 🙏❤
Looks dope. Super fun project.
Yeah, nah. Doesnt look right at all to me.
Maybe a bit GTA server, but does anyone think the white on the wheels should be the same colour as the car?
the wheels make it look like a Jaguar XJ220 cool but outdated pls change the wheels!!
Audio mistake crossover at 10:30
When I seen the wheel I wasn’t a fan but on the car they actually work, love that is so different, would like to see what it looks like with the wings painted to match.
That color is rlly cool. Alongside those carbon parts🥹♥️
Those white plastic crap on the wheels make it look hideous n cheap n nasty....no taste yuk
Love the paint colour, hate the wheels and wish the front wings werent black
well well doesn't stradman have the same wheels on his lamborghini aventador which he rebuilt for sema and i think it is ofc the same wheels anyways it's fine
Car looks amazing! The white section would pop off if it was the usual MA bronze/yellow colour, but it doesn't take away from how class it looks!
i love the wheels they give it a futuristic look, love the colour choice too
Brilliant video as always. Thanks Mat and the team
excellent video, job well done, they are already professionals in working on high-end cars, now the color, I'm honest in my opinion, killed the car, but tastes are tastes, and to each their own, I'm waiting to see when it arrives a 60 ford mustang to rebuild
Your dad is living his best life man. Good on you bro. What a man.
Wasn't definitely expecting this colour but it's awesome. I absolutely love vibrant colours plus I'm in a desperate need of summer and this is the most summery colour ever😅
those wheels need lights....very TRON looking!
Reminds me of Tron. I thought you were mad when I saw the mint at first, but it looks SICK put together. Keep it up!
Hey Mate, brave colour choice Minty Fresh, contrasts so well with the black ❤ Wheels are the dogs B'ks 😊 respect for the build start to finish.  Where do you go from here 🤔 maybe movie car like Kit or V8 Interceptor 😅
Dear God you've turned it into a liquorice allsort! Still if you're happy, that's' what counts, now someone pass the eye bleach!
Big respect to you all. Love the content always. 🙏❤️. Love the car and the colours cool.  But those wheels Matt...I can't quite put my finger on it. The idea is cool but that white ring just makes em look tiny on screen. They almost distract you so much from the awesomeness of the car. They need to be painted I reckon. The white is too distracting. Is it a white wall tyre car or  is it a Tron car. Can't decide. 😎😁🤙.  Loving your work guys.  Where do I sign for a free 48hr shift...✍️✏️
You should paint match the ring around the rim with that minty blue. It would tie the car in together.
Jimmy Broadbent will certainly like the colour, minty is his specialty 👍👍
i love it ❤
The blow me bollie boys blow got me rolling over the floor😂😂😂
Ooh nooo your wheels would look better with the white trim same colour blue as car.
wheels like shit
Yeah...you're right about the wheels 😮 It was looking great until...you know. I actually thought it was a wind up.
Controversial colour and rims choice. But it doesn't matter as long as you enjoy it. It is amazing that you have the chance to give that Mclaren a second chance. 🔥
In german it is “Haube”
Am really glad to have come across your channel man.
Might have been good idea to warm it up before thrashing it down the road.  Hope it’s not too expensive.
Then bloody wheels broke it haha, nice job dude
as always, mental to the end (in an awesome way), so close this time, can't wait for more..... 🙂
Sorry Mat, love your car choices but the colouring in combo with the wheels and carbon don't really tickle my fantasy. But it shouldn't really matter what I think, you got to drive it 😉 have fun
31:00 “engine very bad” is proper English for British engineering very bad.
I first time I think I actually disagree with your alloy choice Matt, they look like they should be on a VW polo, other than that what a great looking car
I love how matts dad just laughs when something goes bad 😂😂❤   I also thought that the machine looked like a gaming PC😂
The wheels are ugly Matt
The colors make it look like a Lightcycle from TRON.
You edited out the fire and everything was good at the end that's a cool move
Mat, I have a sport bike custom painted this exact color! Touches of pearl white and gold accents. It's gorgeous like your car.
You have the best car channel on YouTube. Please never change. Stay golden.
i wish one day i will become like u
Oh Mat!!!! We feel for you!!! But how you still manage to have a positive attitude... Well done!
Nooooo why the wheeels 😢😢😢😢😢 The car itself is amazing tho 💯
The color: 80s welcome back!
Spoiler alert 🤣 0.40
at first, I was uncertain looking at the wheels but once it was installed...it was  🤌 perfect
Love the wheels they look sick 🐶😻✂️🇪🇸
great build. Apart from the polos....
Colour: Mint Wheels: Polo mint.
Great video Mat! The colour will grow on me, the wheels i cant say I'm a fan of the white piece around them, without it would have looked awesome but personal choice. Hopefully the fire and engine was not that bad at the end 😢 Keep up the great work.
I like it matt well done on 5his bulid them wheels make it look electric
The colour looks good but the white on the wheels is terrible, they said it's removable so take it off.
I looks like something Liberace could of loved
like the color alot!
Fabulous
Hey, it looks like it should be in Tron ;-)
Omg those wheels are horrendous with that front lip
The wheels aren't my cup of tea, but who cares. It's your car, and you definitely earned the right to do whatever you like. Well done, awesome built mate, big respect.
The color is amazing!
Really don't like the carbon front end, it should be that lovely minty colour that would look so much better!
There once was a stock called...
U made my dream sports car so beautiful
Paint colour I like but those wheels look ridiculous, like my daughters barbie dune buggy wheels lol.
i need to say that in german hub is not deckel its motorhaube mind that pls
Car tried to burn itself to death after you embarrassed it with those atrocity’s called wheels. Noncemobile.
dude we dont have y food but id like something from your garage novelty bin signed by my fav youtuber...from Cape Town SA
Those wheels make it look a bit like it’s out of Tron movie
Looks amazing, doesn’t suit the wheels, but all in all, mega
the engine its just mclaren thing that we never known
Ohhhhh hell nooooo Mat. The wheels, Im one of them!! 😂 Maybe if you would paint the white on the wheels to the mint color. But as it is now, the mint with black, carbon and then the white.. hhmmm not a fan. But as always a excellent video. Crossing my fingers that the engine isn’t broken.
Love the car and colour… but, sorry, the wheels are dreadful!
Car and car colour looks amazing!!! Seen few mclarens that colour and it really suits the lines of the car…….but the wheels dude!?! 🤦🏻‍♂️ wheels make a car but in this case haven’t, each to their own but they look awful and detract from the overall stunning look.  Rest of the car looks amazing 👌🏻
Love the wheels dude
I love the car and the body work colour. I also love the wheels, but I think the white is too stark. I personally would colour match the white part with the body, but it's your car and you love it 🤘🏻
Three fenders and hood needs to be either all carbon or painted.  Looks of like it is.  But it's yours.  If you're happy I'm happy.  It's sick either way
I love the vw camper colours the only thing that missing is the logo
I love the rims the are sick
I would just drive the truck inside wheelmania.... ;D
Bro thats the sexiest 720s i ever ever seen it looks lika a drag car whith those wheels and congratts you deserve it
Hey Matt what happened to the blue r8? And when do we get to see the new bmw? 😂
The absolute audacity of him calling that a private road lmao. They're public roads, just in the dark.
En español 🫣
Ai Bad
Please tell me I'm not the only one apart from Mat that likes the wheels? And has anyone else noticed that Mat is starting to include the rest of the team on a more permanent basis? Brilliant!! 👏👏👏👏
The car caught its own reflection and seen the wheels and decided to kill itself! Sweet build, mate. I think it would look a million times better without the white parts on the rims, but as long as you love it, that's all that really matters!
Looks insane!
well done the car looks pretty unique. Did you build it faster than freddie? Also when freddie took his car out it broke the first time as well shame
AIR POLLUTION AIR  POLLUTION QIR POLLUTION WARNING WARNING!
It was painful watching that fella run the wheel lugs on with an impact without starting them by hand !
Mate those wheels made me smile like an idiot when I saw them. Sick mate
1.1million views in 18 hours is crazy
Incredible, but not keen on the rims.
Should of colour matched the wheels
Looks like it could be in a TRON movie 👍👍
McLaren 720s Carbonised Edition. 🎉🎉🎉
I think the colour is awesome actually. If the front wings were also the mint blue, i think the carbon would pop a little more. Wheels aren’t for me personally, but if they speak to you, that’s all that matters! Awesome build man
It looks amazing, but I hate the wheels. 🙂
It looks like a spaceship with the wheels and the kit on
Love what you do Mat, but sorry, bad color choice, does not go with the orange.....love the rest though...just my taste.
Another great build Matt and the team a very well done from me.
Are the wheel covers not color match? Or is it the lighting other than that savage build  Still waiting on “engine very bad” shirts
Love everything about it mate. Keep it up.
Mat da 🐐🔥💯🅿️
Just keeps getting better i love your content , stunning car love it well done to you and the team....
Love the video. The seals in front of the door is because it's a moving the part so allows a tolerance between it and the wing so you don't damage the wing when you close the door. Car looks ace.
Going to be hard to top this one Mat, class mate! Well done, to all those involved!
it's called a "Motorhaube" in german, not "Deckel" no idea where you got that from
18:04 It's not correct. German word is not "Deckel". It's "Motorhaube", assuming that the engine is in the front. Or "Kofferraum" for the boot.
I like the wheels, I might have considered having the white parts the same minty color as the body. Nice work Matt
The colour grew on me,, another good video guys..Order my drink the other week, yum yum.. banana flavour all day long 😋
Amazing job mate
That door hinge is just fine. It's not a cast part, so no worries. You don't need to buy a new one.
Car suicided itself once those horrendous wheels went on it
Dangerous thing on the Road
10:31 - Editor mistake. Minor error because I enjoyed the video😁😁
THATS IMPRESSIVE 👏🏼
With the wheels on, giving me "TRON" vibes, ngl!
Love it, although i do wish the white outer trim on the wheels was directional, the point faces the rear of the car on the right side and faces forward on the left, colours stunning 🤩
Car turned out amazing. Only thing I would have done differently is have the wheels completely white instead of just the lips
To be honest, if your german you dont call it "deckel" you call it "Haube" or "Motorhaube", nobody says deckel.
White and black wheels makes it look classy like the white walls like on some old classic cars
What a beauty ❤
Colours cool however  those wheels make it look like it’s running on space savers 👎🏻
the middle cap on the wheels should be the blue too
The colour is amazing.  The wheels..... I am not so keen.
Since i haven`t seen someone mention it. Bonnet translated to German is "Motorhaube" not Deckel. It is a mix from Motor (Engine) and Haube (which means something like Hood).
the wheels make it look like its got tiny tyres from the 50s with white sidewalls. Bin them.
The wheels brooo, WHY!!! Hahaha.
Those horrible, awful rims made the car set itself on fire 🤮🤣
Love the colour. Absolutely hate the wheels.
Interesting colour and <3 the carbon fibre kit and panels.  I’m one of the 50-50 re the wheels. Top job bloke!
How to earn money to buy it
20:27  Mat🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely gorgeous, Color and kit are perfect..
you bent that hinge just fine, there was not much of bending and it strong enough, no need to change it
You could paint the white from the wheels to colour match the car,i hope is not very serious the problem with the engine.
It looks like a TRON film prop car….. I love it! 😮
Next video: „I will rebuild a burned down McLaren“
Man that’s one ugly color and the wheels are terrible, great job on the build but you sure made it look horrible as far as the paint and rims.
I was getting gassed for the wheels and then ☹️💔
I think this repair price is more than the second hand 720.
the car looking good also the wheels 👌
Time for a built engine and upgraded turbos?
Just admire your dedication ❤
Color combination is super, the white smoke not so good, unless a new pope was chosen, what happened ??
Hi mat, I think you should paint the rim protectors the same colour as the car. Love watching your videos.
You took a risk with the color....and it paid off!😊You took a second risk with the wheels...I don't know if taking two big swings paid off...🤓...we'll see...it's great that you didn't do another black car, for sure.
M E N T A L  ! ! !
*Looks like from the movie Tron* 👍
no oil in the engine ?
tbh i really dont like that color scheme, but i dont have to like it, its Mats car :) otherwise nice build :)
Wow what a great job you did but the wheels🤮
Love  the video and content but!! those wheels are SO WRONG. Needs the carbon wings and bonnet painting. Not a good look, sorry.
Amazing color and built. Hate the wheels, it makes the wheels loke small on the car, but its ofc your car so it doesnt matter what we think. Only thing that would make it so much better, is when the front wings are painted as well with exposed carbon on the openings.
Matt great work, not sure about those wheels and the carbon/mint combo, but it’s a unique “paper weight” 🤣   In all seriousness, hope that flame hasn’t killed the engine, whilst it would be good to see the engine rebuild, it would be even better to see it with Tavarish P1 and DDE 720 on tour in the USA or through Europe mate. (As the USA fuel is crap and might well kill that engine)
Love the car but not the wheels, personal choice eh! Hope engine is alright 🙏👍😎
nice Vieo, but the hood is not a "Deckel" in German, its more commenly refered to as a "Motorhaube" or short "Haube".
The colour scheme reminds me of a bowling shoe.  Great work, beautiful job indeed.
PLEASE paint some of the carbon front end to visually carry the lines of the car. It'd look so much better if tgkse lines carried from front to back. Also, not sure if the white rim rings would look better body colour too. The kut REALLY helps the front end thiugh. They always look a lil unfinished but now, looks awesome! ✌️
Love the colour, and the carbon 👌 Not convinced with the wheels, looks a bit like American whitewalls? Amazing transformation from how it started though. Hope the engine isn't very bad 😉
JimmyB detailing licking his lips waiting to his hands on this beast to clean it🦍👍
Absolutely love what you’ve done to it… colour and wheels are 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I think the Americans know what a wing is, as do we Brits know what a fender is, however, love the idea of referring to the the wing or bonnet in different languages, it could be a bit of fun as well as educational. How far round the world can you go by next Christmas?  Love the car by the way.  The wheels give it a modern white wall tyre look which is a trend setting idea, I think.
I said to you at the drivetribe event that the Murcielago looked mint with its new pain, now this is truly mint. I think the white on the wheels should be colour matched to the body.
minty fresh is a loud color. not my thing, but you know what Mat, enjoy your car man. Keep up the great work!
Dont Rev it when the engine is cold😅😅 Why so much people do it??
Sorry to say this but I don’t think the carbon guards fit in with the rest of the build. Bonnet fits with the roof, the front splitter blends to the side skirts and the rear diffuser. Might not be a popular opinion but I would go with standard or vented guards but body colour. Those are some unique wheels my guy! Love all the content you put out when I have the chance to watch! 32:15
Love the colour with the carbon, hate the wheels but I do get the idea 😂
Colour ✔️ wheels ❌
Awesome seeing this joy complete. My OCD is going overdrive as the MA logos are not all facing the same way on the wheel but that's me but love the colour and the wheels are amazing!
You should paint the white bits on the wheels the same as the car, the white just looks weird
yakuza style , put flashing multi phasing coloured led's underneath and advertise it in Tokyo...😂
Love the colour, wheels aren't for me, but if we all liked the same things life would be boring wouldn't it. Respect to Mat for building this how he wants.
I think "(Motor)Haube" is a more common term in German for the bonnet or hood if you're American
I didnt like the wheels at first sight, bc the white was so out there. But when it was put on the car, I liked it. That head to due with, the white frontlight being white aswell. It accually look cool.
In Germany we call it   Motorhaube
in german its not "Deckel" but "Motorhaube" =) 😄
Beautiful colour Matt but don't like the white on the alloys but overall hats off to u amazing build 👏
color is SICK!!!!!!
Best build by far looking forward to the next one
Tron ish
Those RIMS are ugly it look better with the other ones it had Bro.
Well done Mat and family on an epic build. love the content. I hope you get it all sorted man!
Time to go the full distance and beef-up the engine
Very Nice  great paint and wheels reminds me a little of Tron... but I  love that set up one of my top favorites in car rebuilds..
Seems like the car tried to kill itself after you fitted the wheels?🤔
@MatArmstrongbmx next project Ferrari F355 ? 🥲
It seems the whole "deadline - rushing the job" concept is really not a good combination with these expensive complicated cars to rebuilt. Not sure why you keep doing this. Great work though!
Think the alloys will grow, at the moment they're too white and make the wheels look small :P
I was just saying to my friend that they seem to blow engines or manufacture drama here. Also, probably the first hyper car I find ugly.
Nice colour but not sure about the rims. Maybe looks better in real life?
Dammm..colour and wheel so beautiful❤
Colour and wheels ruin it big time
This such a cool car
Lol, the color's literally mint and looks "mint".😂
Nice 17" looking wheels😏
Where is audi rs6?
am i the only one noticing Mat's song choices on this vid, very interesting.
Mint! Even got matching polo wheels. Hope the engine isn’t toast
Engine rebuild time
Mate your a fricken genius 😆
,,It has to be perfect, theres no cutting corners" -while using a re-bent door hinge
The white rim on the wheels make the alloys look tiny, wheels would look class if you took the white rims off
What a car matt gorgeous colour. My only comment would be the white rim guards. I myself done the same colour, which has the car mint fresh but still outstanding, beautiful car welldone mate 👌 😊
Hi Matt sorry what happened hope it’s an easy fix lovely build as usual lovely car good luck to you 👍👍👍
Thats brand new second hand MINT!!! What a build the best so far
Great rebuild and huge achievement. In the side view, the beautiful line of the car is interrupted by the wheel arch, which I think is a shame. The rims match the rest of the color very well.
Awesome color! Reminds me a little of Disney's Stitch tho - in the best sense possible ;)
Mannn those wheels are so bad 🙈
Mat, the colour is sick, but sorry I don't like the white on the wheels.
The whole look with the wheels gives me a Tron vibe. Some ledstrips/el-wires and that would make a Tron look complete 🙂
Fabulous video 🎉 It’s so good to see how relaxed your dad is around the camera these days 😎 Great car colour, hate the wheels 😂 But then, they’re not mine so who gives a 💩. Hope it’s not too messy with the engine 🤞
Matt, please paint the outer rim mint to match the car. Inner rim should stay black.
can’t get Yfood in australia😭
Every thing is great ❤ except the wheels 😢
(T_T) Tell YFood To Deliver to The USA Please!!!!!!
I didn't say what Christmas 😂😂🎉 & definitely no issues 😌👌🏼
Colour choice is superb!
love the wheels they look vary unique but good
i was a bit sceptical about the wheels but i reckon there sick they kinda look like futuristic white walls
Sick wheels!!but for me you need bigger diameters
Bonnet on German is: Haube or Motorhaube (Pronounce: how-beh)
It looks like you're running 'old time' white wall tires. That white should be high gloss black.
That's probably  one of the best builds you've  done, incredible  achievement  to you all.  Amazing  car Amazing  colour. Top job Mat.
Serious one this 🔥👍 Great work 🎉 But it's never easy at the end... 😢
Some weird editing in the last 2 videos. ends up talking over himself
the colour is 10/10
The white rings just make the rims look small. Don’t actually mind them if they didn’t look small. What a car man🙌🏽
Hood in German is Motorhaube
I really don’t know about the wheels. I love the color and the design but I think they look a bit too small. But it could also just look like that in the video.
21:23 looks like batman symbol
He’s literally copied my McLaren on forza lol
Its ok and fine we all learn from our mistakes. Be great 👍
Lose the white off the wheels ;)
By far, this is the best looking car in your garage. Trust me! The color and body kit out shines the rest. Hyper car needs to look exclusive and it is definitely on point. Well done! It was worth the wait. I was actually impatient :)
Hey Matt. I’m from Germany and really love your videos. One little thing I noticed: The German word for bonnet is not „Deckel“. It‘s called „Motorhaube“ or simply „Haube“. 😊 Keep up the great work and good luck for your upcoming projects.
Brushed silver wheels or a dark bronze wheel would look killer.
yfood ordered :) Thanks Matt
Don't like the wheels. REALLY don't like the wheels.
First time that I don't see anything about how the car turned out, maybe it's because the 720s is my dream car and I see it as perfect as it comes out of the box, even so, it works great as always and the important thing is that you really like it.
The car reminds of something out of Tron
Those wheels are mental. The only thing I think they need is the white bit to be painted mint like the car
Isn't it Extra engine oil 🛢️
The stock wheels looked better
How are you going to register this?
Amazing color 😍
Some heavy inspiration from  the @EvolveAutomotive M4 i think
Sorry to say it but that was the car punishing you for putting those shoes on it 😆Each to their own but you've made those massive wheels look like 15's. Amazing build regardless and I absolutely love the colour! Personally I'd paint the front wings to match but it would be a shame to hide the exposed carbon.
Max i wanna see all your cars in ine vid and drive em all. Hope u will😊
I have to say the wheels don't work for me.  But that's OK.  The color is nice, though.
Given the history of crashed, rebuilt McLarens on youtube, how could you possibly be surprised that something bad would happen to the engine?  It was very much to be expected and you should have had the engine overhauled professionally as part of the process,  which would have saved on labor costs and time at the very least.    McLarens have extremely delicate engines, apparently.
Great build and colour but hate those wheels
Mat i freaking love your videos, but wtf is that accent. It's soo off
No mate....the wheels look fugly AF
Matt mate you've absolutely smashed that 1 it looks sooooo good it's unreal the carbon looks mean keep up the good work n send our love to the team ❤
It`s not called "Deckel"!  It's a "Haube" more precise a "Motorhaube" if you have an engine in the front or in this case a "Fronthaube" if the engine is in the back.
Cheers from Germany! Little PSA: It's called Deckel, if it's covering the trunk, but it's called Haube oder Motorhaube, if it's covering the engine.
Not 50/50...I 100% don't like those wheels 😂...originals much better....great stuff though MA 👍
Reminds me of vintage white walls 😂
Stradman's aventador wheel style, they look good
Map, that car is off the chain. Absolutely, amazing looking car. I'd be proud to go round in summer as beautiful as that.😊😊😊😊
Love the wheels! It gives the car a futuristic Tron like look!
Nice colour bodywork , wheels look awful with the white on there bro…..Looks like a pimp mobile ….paint the white bits the same as the car if you want it to look unique….?
Man what a machine sick
TheStradman has those same wheels on his Lambo
The owner has the absolute right to modify any car in any way. This looks awesome.
The orange on the interior looks out of place now. Needs a trip to Dave the trimmer to have the inserts changed to match the mint.  Also wheels make or break a car, those broke it.
What next? Colgate sponsorships? Lol😅
I was gutted for u watching this matt 😢
You could also say "Motorhaube" as a German 😁 I wanna see Mat trying to say that
Looks mansory in a way with mats touch. Mattsory
Love it so much
You deserve all your success mate. You worked damn hard to get there.
Love the rebuild but the colour and wheels aren't to my taste but then again I cannot afford a McLaren so happy to watch yours regardless of colour and wheels
Great to see how youtubers get always access to companies when they normally on closed hours. Do this as a normal civilian. The owner won't even pick the phone up
Love from India ❤
Paint the white rims the same as the mint body colour ,would look bang on
I love the colour scheme. Reminds me of the Flash Green Volvo V70R with Atacama orange leather interior 😍
I was all going so well until the wheels 😅 amazing car the white on the wheels though are horrid.
Tronlaren
fav youtuber out rn, keep it up
Great build!! Hope you're engine is alright, but matt these wheels are genuinely ugly.
Almost "brand" new 🔥
I thought you had torched the car. You got me on that title. About the wheels they are horrendous but I have to admit that they look much nicer after installed.
Audio cross over at 10:35
Amazing work mat, what a car it looks amazing nice work it's like a hot wheels car now with the wheels 🛞 😁🚘👍
Looks like a minty fiat 500 on steroids! Love it
Nice. Apart from the wheels 🤮
Car is definitely a 10 but those wheels brought it down to a 8. NO HATE just my opinion but as long as he’s happy with it that’s all that really matters! Would love love to see it with other wheels tho!
What a talent you and your team are. Simply amazing work every time, but this is the pinnacle of all your builds. However……. I’m really sorry but those wheels with the white rim are not working for me. Also, the side carbon black wings interrupt that gorgeous minty green on the front end. But hey, it’s your car not mine! Express yourself and enjoy the fruits of your labour
looking Beautiful . well done Mat . i love to see your videos . hope one day we can meet . i'm a big fan.
Very nice. Especially the wheels. Very hot 🔥. 😂
Pound is 24 ZAR
The wheels are a bold choice, but works for me ❤
looks wild , i would match the bonet, feels like to much black at the front end
Love those wheels reminds me of the Mazda 787B for some reason
The colour you have chosen is insane!! Such a great colour code 👏👏
White parts on the wheels make them too small.
What happened to the engine 😮
it's called "Motorhaube" not "Deckel" ;)
Wheels are trash :D like CMON :D WTF, I hope that white shit is removable.
D(E)ckel nicht Dockl
The wheels 😩
I’m thinking about unsubscribing as always, the money goes to all the YouTubers heads 😳
what the hell is that epic fail color? dude comon!
Actually in german its called Motorhaube, Motor = engine and Haube = Hood
The exhaust tips look cock-eyed.  Right side looks lower than the left.
i like the wheels very cool
Similar colour to the one Ellie Sax has!
Beautiful Car But Cant stand the wheels. Sorry its marmite wheels there horrible
thats realy loooking sharp cant wait to see it all done
The body kit is nice, but it's unfortunately that there are many fake vents in them, like the ones above the wheels...
Finally it's finished I love the back off the car
no need for clickbait titles ;)
They are the worst wheels, makes the car look like a cheap kit car, everything else is good.
I'm guessing those are knock off Rohanna Wheels? They do have a carbon fiber outer wheel cover that might make the wheels look better like Stradman's and Alex Choi...?
Rims ans tyres look like the Michelin Prodigy advert. Looks cool! At a glace looks like a Speedtail
dude can you take this amazing build to the Nürburgring
Mat the colours are too much. White on the wheels is just not it
color looks great, not a fan of the wheels.
What you have to learn is that with a rebuild car/engine you have to make multiple test drives and slowly increase the power you put into the car to verify that the car/engine can handle the load. NOT JUST REV IT COLD OUT OF THE BLUE BECAUSE ITS COOL!!! Physics are physics and chemistry is chemistry!
Guess you need to call your boy Tavarish and have a new motor built like he did… Can’t wait to see this car in your stable for a long time!!
Great build, but not the wheels please!!!
Colour match the rim faces to the body
Oops 😬
Absolutely fantastic car. However, and its purely my opinion. I do not like the wheels. a far more open style would enhance the look.
Always look forward to your videos 🔥
wheels I absolute hate it, looks like shit it takes all the beauty of the car away
Rad wheels.
The best YouTube channel to watch. Love watching every video 😊
Eddie abbew won’t allow me to drink that. Soz.
Woah I love the end result, the car looks mental!
Love the colour .. the carbon looks so sick ... the wheels wouldn't be my choice but it's personal choice .. but I makes it stand from ever over car
Colour is 🔥, wheels.....🤮
This paint color is amazing for 720s shape wow
Have you noticed, if you squint a bit, that Tony looks like Ron Dennis ?
Get them wheels off
Just the roof glass costs as much as i spent on my car😂😂😂😂😂
Why the front fenders are not mint in color it kinda breaks the whole car in 2 :))
Great build and colour!! Shame about the wheels and the white rims. To me you’ve ruined the whole look. As you said it’s not going to be to everyone’s taste. Albeit, keep up the good work and great builds.  One question. What’s happening to the SEMA RS6?
I have a dare for you Mat. Liberty walk widebody it now >:)
Wheels looks awesome but colour match may be want to see that colour match wheels just like we can do in GTA games
Not a fan at all of the (exposed) carbon bonnet, wings and rear spoiler. The diffuser and side-skirts are good tho.
Tiffany blue mcLaren, if youre american lol
Fair play as always but that looks awful Haha.
🔥🔥
The colour + carbon fibre is 🔥🔥 the wheels would look better without the trim but hey 🤷🏻‍♂️
Such a clean car! 👌
BTW people not subscribed what ya waiting for? Mats content is amazing all the time . hit the subscribe button yo wont regret it
Car looks sick, wheels are awful 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣 ruined the car to be honest. obviously your car your choice and don’t matter what people think as long as you like it 👀 but fair play buddy ✌️
love the colour Mat  not 100% sure on the wheels, hope that its an easy fix
Love the car colour wheels look to small
“It’s definitely a one off”.....Thank gawd for that not your best choice of colour or wheels. Still a great accomplishment though.
We need a Frankenstein built!😂
In Germany we call it Motorhaube, not Deckel
ice blue Invacar
LOL at the wheels
nash the wheels are good
Gotta respect the hustle and the build. Awesome color but that's the ugliest wheels i ever seen in my life. And the front wings could have been the same color as the car. That would be beautiful
i think even mat will reconsider those wheels sooner or later, but i guess we'll find out ;)
I think the reason we don’t like the wheels is because of the white outer rim. If it was black or even colour matched it would look Rotiform af. But hey, I’ll bring some more advice once I hit 2.3m subscribers 😂😂
Been loving this build my favourite car! Love the carbon but really not a fan of the colour unfortunately 😢😢
Much respect Matt..love how you n dad work together... No matter what happens you can expect a laugh n huge smile from dad... He just has such a bright happy Ora... Thank you for great content n doing things no one else can do
Unbelievable mate, you are living every lads dream. fair play to you.
Polo mint wheels!
I would call a wheel style as : TRON
Wheels would have looked better had the white trim been mint the same as the car.
Great job! Even the wheels 😁👍
The mint colour is quite nice, but those wheels are very much a taste I won't acquire any time soon. Good luck with the engine.
Ok, I will give you bonus points for using Moonlight Sonata part 3 for the opening of your video lol/
Beautiful. I'm not here to judge or comment on the wheels, but... they're growing on me and look out of this world. Hope you manage to sort out the smoke 🩵🖤🤍
❤Love that mclaren it looks awesome You did a mad job ❤❤❤
Them wheels are rank, the standard ones look much better
Great work!!! The colors 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
Should’ve kept the full black wheels. Great rebuild though 👌🏼👌🏼
Color & wheels aren't hitting for me but thats the joys of custom cars each to their own still a epic build to watch 👌
Love it that you told Hammond the car have no issues, and the next thing happened to the car was on fire lol.
This car looks sick. Well done all 🎉
Name it "Hornet"
Honestly, hate the wheels. Everything else....LOVE!
Absolutely love it, so much so my son a copy  on Forza 5 👌🤪
This car looks like an Orca, powerfull and beautiful. What an amazing job.
What a lovely car Matt well done but my god get rid of those alloys they are 🤢 lol
Funny hearing how dark y'all feel the tint was really dark. It looks completely normal toys in the U.S. looking good though!!!
Quite a step up from the audi TT bud. Well done with your success champ 😉👍  Nice build. Hope the engine didnt blow a piston rod. 😢they are weak on these cars.
german not deckel but Haube
Incredible build until the wheels. But each to their own…. Still a MAMMOTH rebuild of which I’m sure we’ve never seen!
Omg👀
my jaws literally dropped when i saw those wheels. it's just insane how good this car looks with that colour, the carbon and those absolutely insane wheels. I just love it.
Honestly, build looks unreal exception for the wheels - totally murdered it.  Original's looked so much better.
DDE 720 smoked like that when they first started it back up after they rebuilt it from the an accident
You better call Freddy ! ….still looks sharp ! Congrats !
The wheels just need those white plastic covers removing 🤢
That color combo is spot on!What a machine❤
Love the colour, needs the carbon painted the same. And bin the wheels
Man that colour is sick love it man keep up the great work
🤢
Fantastic build. Love the colour. Colour code the wheels. Great job 😎😎😎👍👍👍
Paint the beauty rims to match the mint green , the white aint bad though
Paint very good, engine and rims very bad 😫
Love the rims. But I would have paint matched then to the minty instead of white.
That car looks crazzyy!! 🤟🤟🤟👏👏👏👏
Freaking crazy ass build Mat 😵😵
Ahh minty colour and polo mint wheels, how very refreshing.. and by refreshing I mean oh dear what is that 😢 much love but it looks weird above anything else.
Not far behind Shmee150 for subscribers.  You’ll be the No.1 car YouTuber soon. 😊👍🏼🙌🏼
Nice car!🔥 personally wouldve done the white trim on the wheels black or blue though
Mat armstrong good job mate🤩. What an impossible video.
The wheels reminded me of the look of the cars in Tron! 😊
As a german, its kinda funny to hear "Or Deckel if you're german", since "Deckel" refers more to something like a lid of a glass, or a bowl. With the hood, the original word is "Motorhaube" (which on the other hand consists of "Motor" (=engine) and "Haube" (=cap, cover), so technically the hood is the enginecap in german :D (which is funny, since it could as well be "enginecover", which in english usually is the piece of plastic in your enginebay covering the engine.
Love the car and colour but not the wheels so much but if you love them that’s all that matters. Hope you in your McLaren your dad in his Ferrari and other members of the team do a Euro Road trip this year.  That would be a good watch. 😊👍🏼
Superb video as usual, the wheels ruin it though in my opinion.
The car could be in a Tron movie. Incredible configuration !
Why are all good giveaways uk only😭please include europe, i wanted to snack on limited edition mat armstrong banana and now i cannot get it, and i also have an empty wall for the cf disk🥹
It is always exciting to watch your videos Mat! Don’t like the wheels and your pick on colour, however it is your taste and it is excellent job! Best regards to your dad, he is awesome!!! :)
Wheels totally ruin what an amazing car you built. The outside circular bit makes them look really small.
Dude love your work and your videos but those wheels are awful wasted the build
Looks great. Hope you can fix it 🤞🤞
Does remind me of Matt Wilts 720s mint coloured with carbon front end
Rims suck. Sorry mate.
those fenders needs to get painted
Underrated channel
Trims on wheels would like better same colour as car as too many colours now otherwise cracking work
100% Excellent (ish)
The amount of ads that have interrupted this video is insane. Can't even skip them either.  If this keeps up I'm going to stop watching.
SICK WHEELS!
Here we go again 🤣🤣🤣
Love the wheel style, however if the white was painted minty green instead 🔥
What a fabulous build. Absolutely insane...but what were you thinking with those wheels 😳. They take your eyes away from the car and cheapen it. Sorry to be brutal but like you say we all have an opinion. Keep up the builds, watched all your stuff so far and loved everything 👍
Simply WOW
Waoooo, what a color beautiful
Matt, I had to press pause and write this comment.....your channel is bloody awesome. Thank you for the continuous quality uploads, your content makes a depressing UK winter a little more brighter for us petrol heads, thank you...
Love the colour.  Wheels really suck..
Love the whole build. Wheels are the crowning glory.
Please Please Please drive this to Monaco
The car looks sic man.
Nooo.. that'll be an engine out job if it isn't an exhaust issue. But the colour works! It'll be a pain to keep clean though.
really beautiful.
Those rubber seals between the panels would look even better if they were the same orane as you have on the interior trim  amazing video as always matt
This looks absolutely insane
Heard the white ring on the wheels is removable 😁
You are such a legend Matty😅🥇🙌
I have a crazy idea, Mat Armstrong live,  a day / 2 day event live streaming fixing a car up with audience participation… never been done I don’t think in a arena obviously with controlled fixes needed.
Love this build @MatArmstrongbmx 👍🏻 the colour scheme, the carbon kit and the wheels… looks like a cross between a Delorean and a vehicle from the Tron movies 🔥🔥
I'm getting serious Tron movie vibes with that paint and rim style 👌
not Deckel, its Haube in german. Motorhaube
Would have been cheaper to get 1950's White wall tyres.
Looks like a GTA 720s but better 😂🔥
I'm not generally a fan of super cars (I drive and forty-year-old Land Rover), but have to admit, your McLaren looks (and sounds) utterly incredible; it's truly a thing beauty. Good luck with diagnosing the engine fault. Looking forward to seeing the first track day video!  PS: Your videos are better than any motoring program I've ever seen. Mx
The color makes it look cheap :( This hurts to look at. Like buying high quality steak only to toss it into the meatgrinder and turn it into sausage. A color shift effect would have made it work just fine
Wrong choice of wheels for me , because they look too small with the cover , but your choice !  Color is extra , and maybe got the front fender paint and just keep the vent in carbon , this would be nice !   A great video man, keep strong for the engine ^^
Something was nagging at me about that Frontend.   Definitely the wings. Too much Carbon, needs some mint splashed in to balance it.   That backend is 🔥though. Diffused looks gnarly.
Brilliant as always....but you're going to have to let your subscribers start choosing your wheels lol. Loved the RS6....except the wheels.......and same here ;).
in German it isn`t Deckel :-) it is a Motorhaube. Great video Mat.
Love the look of all this!! Awesome job Mat and everyone!
love it 😍 hope engines ok 😳
Oh god…. The wheels. Sorry Matt, massive fan of everything you do but my god those wheels are horrible 🤮
Great job and great team work ..But wrong colour it's looks like you are promoting Delivevoo  firm - I will go with dark grey or dark honey but the choice is yours - Respect to genius Mat
As soon as I saw it with the front right wheel on, instantly reminder me of “Tron Legacy” pleeease name it Tron lol
Love the colour combination, looks awesome! Great job on the build 👍🏻👍🏻
Best 720s i have ever seen????    DEFINITELY!!!!!
Wheels ruin it
As long as i am watching your show, everything is OK👌, all the way from RSA🇿🇦
The color is great, the wheels are special, but have the potential to grow on us, all in all, beautiful!
My face as I watch the wheels go on…and that paint color 😳😩
This McLaren makes me emotional. I wish i could ever own a vehicle that provokes as much emotion and passion as this does. My absolute goal in life.
They wouldn't be my first choice for wheels but they are ok. I think the wheels could have been nicer in mint than white. The car seems too busy with the white in my opinion. Great job on the car sorry about the engine.
Sorry Mat I think the wheels ruin it also the color is as you said bold but it is your car.
The car looks awesome until you put on those TRAGIC white trim wheels, pleeeeeeaaaasssee change them .
That now look absolutely incredible!!! What a car that is now! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The paint company screwed you over
Wheels😂
Hmm Matt just had to go back to the 1950’s and get white walls
👍
Absolutely love the car but don’t know about the wheels .
Brilliant video. Love the colour, its mint, love the carbon kit , its ace, absolutely HATE the white rim wheels, they are simply awful. Change the white rim,  its totally  out of sync with the rest of your brilliant upgrades. 😢
The wheels are fugly AF and ruin the car
Great watch, shame about the failure at the end. Why don't you drive it round the Mallory track, safer for testing and no insurance required.
Excellent job on Putting this beautiful car together. The only thing does not look good as those wheels. But I know it's your choice, I hope the engine problem is not a big thing good luck.
I have CT carbon on my M2, i hope they last longer than mine although it's a bit mixed, front splitter ok after 2 and a bit years but side skirts are not good. rear spoiler not great either.
Love the car, hate the wheels..
Even the Build is finished but here we are with more content 😅 with this build ❤
Colour is sick 😮🎉
🤢
Absolutely stunning, although in my opinion the fenders should not have been carbon, it looks odd, like looks out of place in some way to me, and the wheels does not fit at all, but each to our taste and it doesn't change the fact that this car as a whole is beautiful and can't believe how much work you guys put into this!
Whats the music called at 1:24?
Sir, you do very good job, I have a dream to work with you sir
The wheels ruined it
hey great video mat, i hope everyone is doing fine, i need ur help guys, i recently lost my job and i am still on job hunt and i dont have anymore funds left for my household and on top of that my sister's tuition fee is due i tried to do everything to pay the fee and still $5k is left , so guys i need ur help , a little help will help me a lot, i promise once i get a  job i'll pay you back. please help me.
Omfg that color is stunning
I’m sorry Matt, I can’t believe I’m saying this. When you picked those wheels, you have created a sex-spec McLaren from the early 2000’s. If you don’t know what a sex-spec car is, look it up. Mighty car mods boys talk about those kinds of cars all the time.
Hey Mat, I love your videos.  Keep it up!!  Oh, just a note... In German the bonnet called "Motorhaube" not "Deckel"  At the back the trunk is called "Kofferraum Deckel"   ❤
Click like if you think the wheels ruin the cars look (just getting general opinion) 👇
Not feeling those wheels, should have matched the colour of the outer part of the wheels with the bodywork.
loved the intro background music❤👍
Awesome Job guys, hopefully a quick fix and you can get it through registration ok! 😀
I love the color
Hol up, did Mat just throw on some Panda rims on?????? Ayoooooo
That looks menthol😅
Don't like the wheels looks like a throwback to the 60's with white wall tyres.
Just needs a grass catcher and a handle on the back.
Fantastic work Mat, love the colours and the wheels are magnificent…Bravo Mat and the team 👌👏👌
Living the dream dude - your style is awesome - also your dad is the craic 🛠️
mat whilz has a 720s with a ct carbon kit in a light blue it looks very similar
Was not expecting to like the tiffany blue + carbon fiber, but holy hell that looks SIIIIICCCCKKKKKK!!! And the diffusers....sheesh. Driving ANGRY!!
Those wheels ruined the look of the entire car. It looked great until you mounted those on. Yikes.
Rims ruined the car
Looks awesome apart from the weels, I hated it.
what about audi rs6?
Horrible wheels 😢
Love the mint dislike the wheels
Fantastic build 👏👏👏Stunning colour matt. 😍 but   I'm not to sure about the wheels tho. 🤔
You are so clever Matt, but I would take black over that toothpaste colour!
Love the build  The wheels remind me of a 1930s ford with white wall tyres
It just saddens me Endlessly that the chance of me having some nice carbon fibre parts on my car here in Germany is like.... Impossible because of their stupid rules. This thing looks Unreal nice work Team.
wow wow wow 😂❤❤❤
only if the wheels were a little wider
'Richard I know you said Christmas but you never said which Christmas" -MA 2024. Thanks mat for the amazing content through the years, you have single handedly inspired me to rebuild cars myself. Thanks again and keep up the great videos.
sick car, the wheels though... that white dosnt belong there
Stunning apart from the alloys, each to their own
i’m not a fan off the rims no offence mat. but to all the people saying they’re shit, what colours your mclaren
It looks like straight out of Need for Speed ! Looks killer
Car looks sick man so good ❤
Dude, Freddy did the same, not warmed up enough likely. Might be a bit of a job
Get them wheels in the bin! 🗑️ 😂
Are you gonna give this one away too? 👀asking for a friend 😅
Hi Mat please don't go that route of using all capital titles and fake drama titles please! DDE is diong that but people are not happy with those. You have always been an honest person and you don't need the fake drama and all capital titles for your videos!
Hey Mat just try orange(same as interior) or white (same as rims) on body kit. I genuinely feels this colour combination can look much cooler if you try one of these body paints . It'll look sick with carbon.
The car don't like the wheels either
Get Y Food to New Zealand
I love the car and colour but I think the original wheels were better but to each his own
Love tthe rebuild. Great job, color is horrendous though lol. Those tires 🤢🤢 but it's a McLaren
Hate the wheels
i wasnt sure on the wings but with the wheels it all comes together beautifully. I hope the engine is ok?
Sorry those alloys are terrible. Makes it look like something the Yankees would do to ruin a car. The stock alloys are 1 of these best
Rover P6 even the roof comes off
Those rims are not so great
Motorhaube = Deckel in German. Kind Regards from Austria.
Yes!!! What a brilliant colour!!!!
Not a fan of the colour nor the wheel, however I want to add by saying,WELL DONE to you and your team for putting in the grind to get the car to where it is. Surely one of the best YouTube channels around and most certainly my favourite YouTube channel. Look forward to the next one. Cheers!!
nice car, shame about the ghastly rims and cheap looking carbon. looks like some cheap riced out jappa.
I like the colour and carbon fibre sets it off . 👌🏼 If I was to be truthful, wouldn’t be my choice, but as long as you’re happy Matt that’s all that counts.  Great content as always, channel is absolutely second to none .
Love the car great job must have a massive pair on you to take that on but can only hope those horrible plastic looking things on the wheels bolt off but your car your choice
Looks like a 1960’s Cadillac with those wheels 😂 BOLD!
After all the color is pretty lit but the wheels are like ....not good.. But Max nice job mate.
Are you going to tune it to a 1000 horsepower
Turbos blew up?
Thank God it wasn’t on fire
Everything on the car is perfect besides the wings, paint it and leave the carbon ducts exposed
The engine was so offended by those wheels it shat itself 😂 unbelievable build guys get that engine sorted you’ve got a rocket! (Like the wheels really)
Fucking sick! Love the colour and wheels! Modern meets retro! 🤘
It is a spaceship indeed!
well I guess were gettin yet another video
Looks like a tron machine 😂
Let's be honest May Is the best of Revemping any Supercar ✅ Great job Mate 👑 The McLaren looks insane specially that color one of the kind and I was wondering if the Calipers are the same color and maybe the ROOF scoop same color also. Damm that smoke 🙃Hope the car is good Wishing you the best Broo 👍The Rims Woow never seen anything like that before Top McLaren 🔥🔥🔥
10:35 something went wrong
Perfectly running....  Liar liar, motor on fire 😂😂😂
Best color combo I have even seen on a Mclaren. Looks insane
You’ve made a McLaren look as though it’s running white walls!!!
Fantastic build Mat! Love the Blue thats one of my favourite colours! (Don't like the white though). One solid colour for me, Black maybe Bright Chrome would look cool? - The Blue Looks Great, like the Porsche Blue from the early 90s, used to see a lot of max power modded Vauxhalls and Fords repainted in that colour back then, always loved it especially on the Porsches! Only thing i dont like is the White rim pieces, Id have to make em either Gloss Black to match the other accents, wrap em Carbon, or MAYBE the Body Colour Blue, but even that might look too much. I LOVE the Car! And paint job just not that white, looks a bit like old-fashioned white-wall tyres off an old classsic with small wheels in middle, just don't look right for me cos nothing else white. MAYBE if middle of wheels were white ASWELL Or Whatever colour just ALL One colour, maybe even DIP WHOLE Wheels BRIGHT CHROME!!? then THAT might look cool! 😉 (Just my opinion). STILL a cool car! Well bit HOT ATM! Lol 😂🙄🤦🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧
That mint and carbon combo is insanely beautiful. However, the design and colour of the wheels are pig ugly imho and 'cheapen' the overall look. Hope the engine's ok.
First drive - Do we think the inertia pushed the oil backwards and caused it to be burned out of the exhaust?
Sorry about the fire.   I appreciate the rim design but not a fan. Balance is off some how.  But congrats and thanks for another great build.🎉
That colour is honestly foul. Otherwise not bad.
Well done Mat, Tony, and Crew, what a great build this has been, very exciting to watch you overcome all the challenges. I'm sure you are going to have the same issues that you and Tavarish had when starting the car after sitting a while, it will get sorted. I love the colour, especially the wheels. Great job Wheelmania, they make me think of the white walls on the great cars of the Great Gasby era, like the Buggati's of old. Very classy. Minty fresh!!
Wow ❤
mat armstrong is my go to creator when i eat dinner watching youtube
Need some paint on those carbon wings
yeah.. the wheel white needs to go the same colour as the car
The spearmint polo 720S you love to see it
There's a reason nobody ever paints cars that particulary awful blue, it's the identical colour to every 1970s Invacar, which was a small single-seater three wheeler designed for use by disabled drivers in the UK, commonly known as a spaz chariot at the time.
When I saw the title I thought it was WhistlinDiesel
brilliant job however there is such a thing as too much carbon and this is it ...the bonnet looks what  bad and the wheels have ruined what could've been a masterpiece
wheels are fire!!!
Amazing Content! ❤
It looks awesome. Not Mclaren like, but awesome.
Car looks savage my guy!!! Love the colour and the wheels….tell me ….ain’t the wheels the same as stradmans on his carbon lambo?? His got pink trim yours is white!!!
I actually like the wheels
Yep wheels are awful, I think probably the worst wheels I’ve ever seen on a car. sorry Matt. But that’s the thing with cars, everyone has an opinion and keep doing what your doing, it’s awesome.
take the white part out of the wheel, then it will look even better
Colour and wheels look awful
When "Happy Banana" merch coming out ? :D
Nike  fleece tech colour thats mad it pops🎉🎉🎉🎉😊
looks like a Tron car 😅
Great video as usual. And great effort on that build. You are a legend.
Think there might be a reason there isn't another one like this 🙈 Love the videos!!!
Damn 1mil views in less than 15 hrs 🎉
The assembling is satisfying to watch, the colour is sick and those wheels are mental🙌👌
The wheels ruined it for me
Like you said its personal to you and i love what you have done with this car . It is a 1of 1 .
50/50 is rather optimistic I would say 🙃
It looks ‘mint’!!! Not a fan of the carbon bonnet wrapping around the car - would look better wrapped on the sides… apart from that it’s MINT!!!
It looks ‘mint’!!! Not a fan of the carbon bonnet wrapping around the car - would look better wrapped on the sides… apart from that it’s MINT!!!
Super práce ale ty kola jsou na to auto nepasují😮.....hrozný design 😮
Very Gulf inspired colour way, Mat. I’m not a fan of the white on the wheels (the inside is great though - design and colour), but as you say, it’s a personal choice. I just hope the engine isn’t terminal. Fingers crossed for you!
The wheels look like something out of Pay n spray in GTA. I love it! 😂
I think that the white on the wheels should be the mint colour
The wheels NEED to go minty as well !!!
Absolutely love the colour , stunning !!! Though yeah not a fan of the wheels , but the world would be pretty boring if we all liked the same , epic build , one question though......how in the hell are you going to top this one ?? 🤣🤣 Gotta do something British like a lotus or TVR surely 😜
You should sell this car to Central Cee. This is the color for his new album. Or just let HIM have it for a music video or something
What is DDE to you sir mat can you bring that to new DDE hoonigan HQ
We call them "fenders" in Australia as well Matt
Everybody WTF when they saw the wheels??? Maybe he forgot to remove dat white plastic protection. 🤣
The mistake was definitely that song choice! I didn't make it past that...
Congratulations 🎉 it looks EPIC bru
How would that window tint not pass? Nice wheel choice btw
It was all going so well until those wheels turned up.
I just love the colour you chose for the car and the body kit looks amazing 😮. Maybe paint the front fenders and hood with some carbon pieces exposed its a little to mutch carbon now 😁.
Also...why put Stradman wheels on it? Be original
Hey please change the wheels
nice colour wheels look crap
hope you are not going mad with tune remember what happened to freddies engine as they don't build these engines to take a lot of horsepower.
Cannot wait for a wrecked koenigsegg rebuild
Wheels are hideous, car hates em that's why it set itself on fire
wow thats beautiful best car
🔥🔥🔥
Wheels have just spoilt it! The white trim has made the wheels look smaller 😢
Engine cold asf prolly no oil and some reckage undetected
Sorry mat but the wheels have just ruined it 😭😭😭😭
Seems to be a common issue them con rods in those engines.
Please, never say "Deckel" again, unless you're taking about the cap of your Whyfood... 😂
I'll never understand why you can't just break something in without breaking it.
Color is great the wheels I'm not a fan of just remove the white rings and it will be good
Matt’s wheel choices are definitely a little bit crazy and sometimes feel they dont work but this time i felt it was a match meant to be. It was perfect the only thing i would change on them is put mclaren logos in orange in the centre
Matt you and your dad done great job car looking amazing the wheels are good paint the white bits mint to match would be better ...❤
Great build, quite like the colour, but sorry, the wheels, why? 🤮
They look like white walls oooh NAHHHH
Not a big mclaren fan BUT this makes me an even bigger non mclaren fan 😂
the colour scheme is your best yet! The rims look amazing and very unique
Hi Matt, If you were to take the trim off the wheels, they look like Mondeo wheels!!!!!!
I vote to paint the fenders.  Yes I'm American.  Leave the vented areas in exposed carbon but other parts of it minty.
That's a monster of a McLaren 720 S
Playing amaPiano now 😂🇿🇦
I Know what the issue is.  You must have drove it past a mirror, and now it’s killed itself.   Great jobs Loved the videos as always 👍🏼👍🏼🙌🏻
Matt that colour looks nice mate nice seeing u and u dad doing the cars mate
They look like the james aventedoor
Love the wheels, real Bugsy Malone feel (White wall tyres), when’s the raffle for this one? 😎🍺
I’d say you put to much oil in it as that can cause that issue
I bet the engine smoke is another big drama out of some small issue as always. Rest assure everything will be fine.
You sure it's not fuel dumping.  Knackered injectors
Hate the color and the wheels, but hey is ur taste and is ur money, so good for u!!! 🎉
It looks like something out of Tron. AKA badass! You should name it “Quorra” after Olivia Wilde’s character in Tron Legacy!
Bumbuclaat bro doe sell dat eno kip it mi love this this did like the porche n the Audi but dis tek di cake bless
Mat your car journey has inspired me to take a new direction in life and I've finally found my first youtube car build and will be posting vids soon THANK YOU for the inspiration and all you do for those that watch your content!!!!!! You have inspired life changing moves in my life!!!
Sic build .. just not a fan of the wheels
lovely color
Wheels - white=no maybe orange
It's your car. Not a color I would have picked. 🤣
Maclaren have package. At time of purchase a person can choose to remove all major and minor panel gaps. And I am  waiting for tuning part.
The white totally ruins it to be honest.
I really enjoyed this video most from all my years of watching vehicle build content.
Great build love the car but not the wheels all the best to you and the team.
🔥🔥🔥
Car looked amazing until you fitted those horrendous wheels.
paint match the aero disk to the car and paint match the carbon fenders
McLaren literally makes the worst engines lol...
Awesome build...! I love it
shame about the wheels 🙃
Bad flame 😂
those wheels are so sick
Awesome color and wheels... One hell of a car..
just wow
Nice job car is amazing but not sure on the wheels look like white wall tyres are fitted
One of the best car content channels on YT
Looks sick Mat. Love it 🥰
The carbon fenders and hood should be body color except in the vents, it would flow better. The wheels are not bad looking but paint the ring matte metallic dark gray. Right now it looks like one of the HyperCars on GTA5 some 12 year old puts whitewalls on.
lets see him rebuild a Alfa Romeo Julia.
Same old story.  Getting a tad predictable now.  Buy a car, build a car, chav said car to the nines, can’t resist taking car once fully chaved for a spin, don’t warn said car up, boots car with stupid laughing, car f@@ks up.  😴
Since when did ur videos become so damn dramatic it's a video of a car not the end of a war 😭
I wish we could get the limited edition Y food Mat Armstrong version here in the States.. oh well..
thats the "TRON 720s"
JUST WOW! INSANE
Fire 🔥 video bro!
Eish wheels change
You have to have a lot of confidence to run those wheels 🙂
The white rim on those wheels does no justice...makes them look smaller...😢.....sorry Mat!
Dude if this thing burn down I'm done 😂
Man the wheels 😢 don't do it for me lovely car other wize well done 👏
Bro WheelMania really dont want curbed wheels lol 🤣🤣
This was my summer car irl
We need a JDM build on the channel.
The wheels are sick, keep up the good work 🤙🏽
The wheels look like Brixton forged clones.
I kinda like the wrap and with the white tires
what is the name of the song  that  was played in the last part of the video
That's what it happens with the engine when you're in a hurry to put on ugly wheels. The car looks good, the color is amazing but those wheels make themselves look small because of the white circles...it's like you have white walls on 60's american car...it doesn't go with the rest of the car but hey, it's your car. Respect for all the hard work !  P. S. You got the right wheels on your dad's Ferrari 👍
put BBS LM-R will look way better
Awesome job mat,  I hope u let the engine run warm before u drove away like that ❤
wheels are fire
I didn't like the color theme. It doesn't flow.
having Tony is the blessing. even just watching him for a few minutes makes my days a whole lot better.
Well done dude looks amazing, what an achievement
Love the colour with the Carbon, I like the wheels but would be even better, in my opinion, with the white painted the same mint colour.
Love your videos Mat and you and your dad reminds me of what me and my pops could of had it’s so rad what you’ve done makes me want to keep going with my Subarus
That thing looks nuts Matt I love it and I love what you do so much!! Please keep doing what your doing❤
Great build Mat and Tony,but sorry the wheels spoil the car,they look like white wall tyres? Or hub caps…sorry. What was the outcome with the motor
That’s has to be nicknamed polo with that colour and white rims!!
Welcome to McLaren ownership.. aaaaannn its broken, like i said... welcome to McLaren ownership..
Is it me, or does every McLaren on youtube end up with a blown engine?
I was waiting for this car to be done
Mclaren Tron car
Awesome work. Need to paint the front quarter and bonnet with carbon bits on them. Looks unfinished with all that carbon.
double yellows on a "private road" 🤔🤫
Its not „Deckel“ its „Motorhaube“ 😝 like enginecover
Horrible colour. First time ever Matt has disappointed me so much.  Give it to Hannah as only a girl should be seen in that!!! Absolutely ridiculous. Worst choice ever!😢
wheels looks ok but maybe with a different color? too many colors going on with the car. but definitely coming along nicely. that baptism of fire wasnt all that unexpected as well 😅
Hola mat , soy José. Sigo tu canal de YouTube en español,  me gustaría mucho que pudieras hablar con tavarish y más gente que también se sumaran a ti con los canales secundarios en español como el tuyo. Amo tus videos y amos los autos. Necesito más contenidos tan bueno como el de ustedes que en español no tenemos mucho. Saludos desde chile.
My step father had a HK Monaro with a big block 454 Chevy engine in an almost identical colour, often it was the colour that would stop people in their tracks before the angry noises it made. Love it.
Awesome build mate, the styling is not to my taste but I can appreciate it
This build is CRAZY, looks straight out of TRON 🥵  What a unique build! So special
The wheels are like clown shoes whilst wearing a racing suit
Hey @MatArmstrong in german we say Haube ;) xD And thanks for your Videos love to watch them.
All looks amazing except the 🛞🛞
“I know we said Christmas, but I didn’t say what Christmas” 😂😂
Amazing results, was worth waiting 😮
When you go to Los santos customs for the first time 😂
u gotta paint match the wheels to the wrap
Nice car and color.
It looks epic 👌👌 call it the orca the front end looks like one 😄
Honestly wasnt a big fan of the carbon front end but the white trim on the wheels actually make it look amazing. Top tier choices, i feel silly for doubting.
@mat i think you should you go full minty on the car
I hope the engine is okay buddy
I reckon the engine vomited because of the wheels!! 🤣
paint color is nice but the rims needed to be aggressive deep dish gold rims ... the problem with the white cap rims is they look like white wall tires from a distance and they make the rims lack depth in the look .... but still incredible build
wheels are shit, total miss
Love the color
Love the wheels brother next level build especially with the paint carbon theam
the wheels would have looked so nice without the white all he needed were some black wheels
Bruv those wheels r lookin sick.🔥🔥
Where did you get the wheels from Benny’s garage 😂
Can only imagine this build in Monaco 🔥🔥
wheels? computer says no...
Absolutely Stunning bro !
it looks like a car from the film tron
the colo is amazing the only thing i would have done is copied TJ in top of the wheel so the giant black gap doesn't make it look unbalanced
Matt I feel like your builds know you have a channel and have a knack for just being dramatic for the audience😂😂 why is it smoking
Looks sick! The wheels are nice, but they look tiny because of the white ring. 🤷🏾‍♂️
Celeste. Beautiful colour.
Hate the wheels
what happened to the Rs6?
The white wheel caps need to be changed to carbon fibre then its complete bro 👌
I’m loving watching the build of the McLaren love the colour 👍🏼
Paint the front fenders but leave the louvers carbon!!! From the side its look more solid jf it was all blue love it keep up the sold work!!
i think if the white part of the wheels matched the mint color of the car, it would look so dope
Wheelmania does amazing job as always also great to see them growing as a business
Great build but those wheels mess it  up
wheels ...  amazing color....
Came out of monk mode to watch this in colour.  Not gonna lie, the car is amazing.  Hope you fix the engine soon. 🫡🙌🙌🙌
Traducirlo a es pañol el vídeo ok
Its so awesome that he always does it with his dad :D This is just heart warming. He literally went from audis to now mclarens. Damn. JUST  FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS AND YOU WILL ACOMPLISH THEM !
honestly your car is looking confused, you have glossy black with carbon and blue i think you should get rid of the blue there is absolutely zero uniformity with the car i have  been following this build for so long and you fucked it up with a bright blue
TRON CAR
the car looks amazing, im not 100% on the wheels but its your car but the rest of it is a thing of beauty, I hope the smoking is just to much oil in it and and easy fix !
Dang son😊
I can’t afford any of the cars you make in every video but I’m so obsessed with how you guys put so much effort and make it look so beautiful and perfect 🧿🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pepper minty matt finish 😊
Those wheels are awful, that car deserves high end fragile looking wheels with thin alloys. It's sacrilege, maybe that's why the engine committed suicide
Wheels won't be for everyone but they're different and I like that! Think they will pop more if you color match what's white on the wheels to the body color ( tiffany blue, minty ) whatever you want to call it :)
Mat!!  colour is great. Rims however are yuk.
Color ia not my taste...if it was mine pearl white. Rims look awful sorry. With that color scheme...all back is the better option.
car is good mags are crap
🤞🤞🤞❤️
car looks amazing especially with the carbon kit! wheels are horrible, do you not have real wheels available in the uk?
😂😂
is dad wearin a fluted bezel day date
❤
This turned out so nice! Can't believe you got it so nice and then the donk smoked out. Hope its not too major 🎉
Looks like the blue bike in the tron movie. Super sick!
great colour, shocking wheels though, enjoy it
maybe the engine will be ready before this Christmas
My level of obsession with this channel requires medical attention 😫🩵
OK OK DAAAAAAAAAAAMN.....AWSOM COLOR SCEEEEEEM....................I COMMENTED ..........LONG TIMR VEIWER .......GOOOOOOD STUFF MAN ,,,,,,,PEACE.;']>>~~~
in german we say motorhaube
Like the colour ❤! Hope the engine will be good after🎉
It's not "Deckel" it's called a "Motorhaube" in German.
Blown up McClaren club! I like the colors, but kind of looks like toothpaste. Tony is hilarious, gets better every vid. Love to hang out at the bar with that guy! Also love the new music!
I love to see u build cars from just from scratch   BTW I love the 720s u just built Its so amazing I think one day ull build a pagani or koenigseggs from scratch. And also think that the tyres u put on the mclaren is sich and ur mclaren looks like it was made from MANSORY itself
Another great video ! Really enjoying this build i personally really liked the rear loan wheels better than the ones you chose Matt but it is your car ! Looking forward to finding out what the engine really bad problem is 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Mat...why do rear engine cars catch fire and burn out and completely destroying the vehicle... Mat can you give a reason for engine fires on rear engine cars???
uk regulations dont allow for tints?
I think the gaurds need to be painted and leave the air vents carbon
Perfect spec
Did you ask your dad if he likes the colors?
Hey, anyone notice the vocal overlap between 10:00 - 11:00?
Colour is fine but those wheels OMG. 😂
All it needs now is a roof scoop
Ur dad is a comedian I swear 😂💀💀😂
@mat armstrong this is a splended job educative and informative and @Tony great dad with the best skills always thumbs 👍 and fingers always 🤞
LOVE IT!!
Why didn't you take the windshield from the old tub
Bruh that car is amazing ! Only thing I dislike it the carbon fiber front wings by the hood on top I think those should be mint! Also the calibers should be white or mint and the interior !
i dont know how…but the wheels work so well😭😭🔥
I wonder if Mat really likes this colours or he just to it to get more comments , either way I love your videos mate
The reason it smoked is because the last time it was ran, the engine was revved up and sent oil to the turbo for what it thought was going to be a run. When it idled down, the oil sat in the turbo and then burns off on next start. All turbos will do it which is why they used to come with timers to let the car idle for 2 minutes to cycle the oil to help cool the turbskies
That's an epic spec !!
Nooooo.. hope ya didn't kill it.  Not a huge fan of the wheels.. but no biggie it's a maclaren.
MA 720s vs DDE 720 GTR 🫣🫣
not to be a complete glazer, but i only recently found this channel and i think you do such a nice job making and editing these videos. quickly becoming one of my favorites and this car especially has been really cool to see come together
I like the channel and this repair but wheels… really as u said I didnt like them, I think white thing on wheels is ruining the look absolutely
Nah.. the wheels make look cheap
Amazing color. What is the paint code? I’m thinking of painting my Porsche this color with some pearl in it
What software do you use for editing by the way? I noticed the mistake at 10:30 and could care less! Car is epic, video is just as epic! Keep killing it!
Looks amazing! Love the color! Hope you can get it up and running soon! Cheers for the US
I see a theme with this one. Mint bodywork and Polo wheels. This build is on fire!
Sick wheel combo. Awesome!
I LOVIT MATT!! Im such a big fan!
Daaaamn the mint colour with the rims design choice is looking sick....🥰🔥👍.  Btw can i ask something? Is this like the end of the journey of this 720s build? 😊
Only thing is I'm not too keen on the wheels... but, not my car, and as you stress all the time, we should make our cars however we want  🖤
The wheels are terrible.
Cambia le ruote. Ottimo Lavoro. Bravi.
Proper build. Wheels fit the look. Hope the engine is good tho lol
MATTTTTT two wheel threw off the car so much! I would say either paint the white section orange, mint blue or get it wrapped in carbon.
Massive well done Mat that car is awesome and like you said the wheels will divide and for me it’s a no but it’s yours you go with it and enjoy.
not a fan of the color scheme, but it’s still a very nice car.  congrats!
That Car looks better and better the more you work on it. I had to comment twice, cos it’s so beautiful 😢
They wheels make it look like a car from the 1960's 😅
Finish it with white stripes on the carbon like the wheels 🔥🔥 every build is unique
Great color choice.
👍 wheels look mad. Car is bloody beauty bonzer cheers from(a very hot 42 Celsius) Australia
Such a cool build, I love the color, carbon and wheels!
It’s very tron looking and I absolutely love it! So fricken cool dude.
Your most beautiful Car in your entire collection, whoa 😅👌🏼
Whats the big fuss about i like thoes wheels there arnt like anything ive seen b4😮 there are truly a masterpiece.
Those wheels are trash .
Didnt like the color and didn't like the wheels ... But what was inspirational is the fact that you've rebuilt A Mclaren....I mean... mate... do you even understand that level...that audicity to do things that only McLarens do  ... are you levitating above us ... hell yes!!!
Unbelievable build. Love it, I’d have some chrome wheels personally, not keen on those but as you say, each to their own. Hope it’s not too serious 🙏🏼
Cars fantastic, not keen on the wheels, not a criticism just personal preference, great job 👍🏻
Great job Matt. But the wheels are certainly not to my taste, but if you love em, onya!
That thing is sick!
Wheels look sick, they’re different in a good way. I can see a light kit behind the rim lip. Good job
Hate mclarens, love this one. Hate the wheels with a passion but again, it's matt. Can't hate on much. The smoke is probably just a boost pipe blown off. Bit of drama to end the video always helps the views.
Did you get jimmy Broadbent permission to use his official colour??🤞
I like the color but the other stuff like the carbon body kit I don't care for. It's just distracting, but it's not my car so as long as you like it that's cool with me
love the car, hate the rims
Those new rims on the 720s look sick
Looks I like the color
Love the car love the color love the carbon fiber i absolutely hate the wheels
Gotta say… I’m very proud of you… I’ve been watching your vids since day 1. From customizing your mercedes, to rebuilding a McLaren and a dream!!! Cheers!!!
Amazing car and colour choices, not a fan of the wheels but the rest is 🔥
Wow amazing colour scheme the car looks awesome well done hope it’s not a major problem with the engine ✌️
That looks insane with that Tiffany blue green mint color offset with the carbon and black ! You did a great job Sir !  An suv the same color would look lit af!! I’m just glad your made it how your wanted it.  Ppl are so judgmental and forget we are only on this tiny rock for a small time so make it enjoyable be happy and make the best of it.   Keep being your authentic self always an be safe Brother! from across the pond.
❤ the color!!!!!💯🎯
The color is great. Those wheels are super dope!
Car looks amazing but those wheels make it go from 10 to 5
Congrats, you've made a very expensive tube of toothpaste
Colour match the fugly wheels. Awesome build, congratulations.
I think you're German translation was wrong,.. regards from Germany!
that wing in the back looks like the batman logo and it makes the car looks so much more badass
If it had an exposed carbon front bumper it would look pretty sick, giving off a R34 GTR Dry Carbon Z-Tune look.
Well I mean  At least you weren't driving it in a field.
Ugliest wheels I've ever seen
A classic MA build where he ruins it with the wheels.
i think DDE needs that machine for their 720 gtr
Looks fresh tbf! Stradman Aventador vibes. Love it!
Loved the bonnet, hood or Deckel traduction. Only thing, in German you rather call it "Motorhaube", but Deckel dies the job 😂❤
Oh 😮
How come you didn't have the wheels delivered?
love the wheels but would they look better paint matched to the car?
Car looks nice, maybe paint match the pieces over the front wheels?
The mint colour needs to be put on the front wings at least, it makes the proportions looks off on the side view imo
THAT LOOKS SO INSANE!
🤢🤮 The wheels?  WTF?
Or guard if your Australian  and we use bonnet as well stop forgetting us matt
This is the best looking MA car, no doubt about it. 🔥 Hope the engine is alright 🥲
Hey I would love to have some of that yfood only problem is am from jamaica 🇯🇲 but love your videos love your work keep it up
You should consider doing the wheel trim rings to match the body color.
I am watching this video with a 100 000 people at the same time😂
Looks amazing! Screw the haters! Love it!
Your father should do stand up comedy 😅😅
Car looks great but I'm the 50% that doesn't like those wheels.
sweet color and rims.. prefect indeed
Definitely missed a chance for a "spoiler alert" joke when we all saw the colour of the spoiler before you revealed the body work .... 😂
Haggard Garage unfortunately ruined that mint color on cars for me. All I can picture is onions, big head hanging out the genesis.
I wish we could get YFood in the states.
White WALLS.  That's BALLS
How sick would this car look if it was dark burgundy?
It's just sick looking 🖤
Nah bro, the wheels are a absolute miss.
Shouldn’t the white bits on the wheels been orange to tie the interior and exterior together? They look sharp white but just saying the overall look is savage
Mate one thing you don't do in a mclaren is put your foot down before the engine is at the right temperature or even In any car really
Absolutely love the colors, insane looking car
The car looks good, but those wheels are so bad bro...
Don’t like the wheels I think you could’ve done better
Wow
20:28 when you stub your pinky toe on the table leg.
Paint the front fenders
engine very bad boys
paint amazong, wheels not 😁😁😁 praying for the engine 🥲
Looks like a car from Tron 😮
Love the color! Great choice 👍🏻
amazing wheels omgg
She’s SO BEAUTIFUL!!! Really hope you can keep her running.
Another awesome build, well done team!. Really like the design of the wheel, but just not vibing with the white trim.
The colour scheme, especially the rims makes the car look very busy Mat. Try a different design. But what a journey!
Oh man.  Love the color. At least Mat likes the wheels...but i don't think it will be 50/50 like Mat thinks
Love the color, would have picked a different wheel, or at least kept it all one color.
I LOVE THE COLOUR SCHEME MAT, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK 🙌
That is 1 sick looking car Mat. ❤
The Tron Mobile. LOL
If paint the fenders, and keep the louvers carbon, but that’s just me haha
Those wheels and colour scheme give it a Tron-like appearance…
whats the song?? it's amazing
So funny that Adam LZ just went an purchased an old 964 in near exact same colour. You guys a cosmically linked.
The wheels are perfect. It looks f’ing awesome
Seeing how the McLaren is built it boggles the mind that they charge so much for each model, but it only goes to show you those that have the money never under the words "how much" ¿`_
Put some white LED lights behind the old fashion whitewall is what it looks like to me ,definitely badass
its like a skidoo Freeride.
Matts dad : you know who I am.  We do, you're a Ferrari owner
I love the color wow so beautiful and different!!!!!!
Those wheels are so dog shit, the car tried to set itself on fire out of embarrassment.
Dude the lime green hatchback color is one thing but seriously....take the white walls off.
Keep on going Matt, you are inspirational to all the cars lovers. Great and amazing videos as always
Mat you are insane thank you for making these videos! I have been working on my own euro cars and saving myself tons. Love the channel def have a new sub 🙌🏻
Beautiful car!!!!!
Looks awesome! Need to paint the white on the rims the same as the car an would look sick
Sorry but those wheels look like whitewalls 👎🏻
21:18 so clean 🧼
The colour, the carbon and the wheels not my thing but i respect it its your choice
Wheels are not good . Make them paint matched on the accent
it would be cool if he used black for it , that colour is not bad though
Looked good until you put the wheels on. Ruined it!!
Absolutely love your relationship with your dad, all great memories that will last a life time!!
Well done and congratulations. You were correct about the 50/50 split on the wheels. To each his own
Mint and white tires.. hark back to the 1950's.
Mannn. Mat’s videos are awesome, and no disrespect but those wheels are not it..
When you can binge watch a YouTube channel you know that content is 🔥
I wasn't 'sold' on that 'minty fresh color' but as the panels went on???
Like the car, wheels have to be changed 👎🏼
Those white rings would look awesome in the same colour as the car. Now the white is ruining the wheel in my opinion...
im starting to wonder if your colour blind lol
Carbon bumper would have finished it off completely 😍
What happened to the engine? Love the car and the color but IMO the wheels gotta go. They look like white walls on a super car. The rings could be painted to match the wheels. Love the show!
Savage!!!!! It’s perfect!! Sheeeeesh wow
The carbon section above wheels look odd in carbon, kind of breaks the lines of the car, wheels seem to highlight it more. Great effort building the car, it stilllooks amazing, jealous as. Keep up the good work.
Mr & Mrs ...........Dude !! ........OUTSTANDING JOB !!  ....GodBless You & You're Team ......Peace
I like the wheels actually.
That green color is the same color they paint school bus interiors in the US. It’s to help prevent the children from getting car sick and vomiting. Unfortunately it has the reverse effect on adults.
Looks amazing great work rebuilding this beauty
Whos thinking one of the turbos is FUBAR
I left my like cause i really like you, but those wheels, god they’re ugly as fuck 🤣
Look's like white walls on the tire ✌️
Congrats on your build. My only change would be color match wheels and body. I think that would set it off.
I would have done a dark candy red and black with gold rims but looks great tho
Those wheels are sick! They look similar to the ones the stradman put on his Aventador
Y’all did it again but even better! The McLaren is 💯
Hey mat, im german and i wonder if you said Deckel? Cause the bonnet is actually called Motorhaube in german. Deckel means lid
that carbon fibre is the  best looking thing ever
The overall look is dope ❤❤
Looks Great! I think the lip on the wheels would look better the color of the car! Just my opinion! I just think the white doesn’t match the Mint And Black! But still a Awesome Build! Hope the motor is ok!
Looks insane bro. 🎉
Personally I love the rims so much, it adds a perfect contrast and flare with the carbon kit and I’m not even much of a mclaren guy. Keep up the great work Mat!
Love the music in this video 😊 The colour compliments the Carbon Fibre. It is awesome when your builds are not perfect, the human factor is the reason I enjoy watching.
I think if the fender and the white circle on the wheel were painted mint like the rest of the car it would look perfect
Those fenders need to be painted to match the body
Black rims yes but not a fan of the extra grey/white rim add on bit .. 👎
The car itself is absolutely phenomenal!!! The color scheme, not so much.... Are you color blind or did Hoovie just hit you with the 'Ugly Stick'?
The ugly wheel in the world..please change it mat..love all your videos🎉🎉
I am speechless ❤ wow what a car ❤ beautiful result ❤ well done ❤
Those wheels are GORGEOUS
I am still waitng for the RS6 to be rebuilt!!🥲
What a transformation
Love it Mat, well done mate.
Or fender if you’re American.  OR CANADIAN!  Haha  Looking beastly man!  Great build.  Prayers for the engine from the Great White North.
Wheels?? Naaah, not this time. Not impressed.
Well done 👏  great looking motor
I think the front wings/fenders need painted the body color but leaving the gills carbon. Those wheels need replaced ASAP!
Gosh, that's the first time I was happy that it was only kinda clickbait! Get that thing done, it looks amazing!
Love the colour and work as always team. Not sold on the wheels but I'm just some guy on the internet. Keep smashing out winners! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Anyone else thinking 1982 Tron? Those wheels are awesome MA!
Wheels🤮 otherwise amazing build so good
The wheels looks like Damon DDE 720s/gtr
Amazing work as always 👏  good team !
As @richrebuilds once said, "Never buy a McLaren"
Those wheels look like the same ones that @stradman has on his aventador
😮 Every set of custom wheels has been awesome...but for me these ones are a miss. Body color is good
Love the colour choice Mat
"And also" lol
Beautiful and amazing what you've done ith it. Only thing I would have done different is the colour, what about a proper bright Ferrari yellow?
THIS MAN REBUILT A PORSCHE 911,AND NOW A MCLAREN???????
Crazy video
Engine very bad... bead locks need to go body colour maybe the rims I  white.
the wheels are a little bit off for me but the car is fire, hopefully you keep this car for yourself.
oh man, so far youve been great with paint and okay with wheels. but this color is definitely not the best pick and the rims...well, this is the design i always skipped as first in most wanted. lets put it that way. you wont top tavarish with this 720 unfortunately
Always awesome!😊
Sick!!
Amazing build and I appreciate that the wheels are personal touch for you but…..I really don’t like them. It makes the tire look smaller and it looks just awkward.  Please don’t take me wrong here. I am not an hater just expressing my opinion. Superb work with the car. ❤
Loved following the series, but Ugh those wheels are terrible!!
Tron
NO WAY!!!! In all honesty this is the best color you have chosen for any car yet!!!!
Those wheels are horrifically ugly!!!!
Always taking it up another level 💪
Please remove the white accent atrocity from the otherwise beautiful wheels.
Sorry, those wheels are awful
And one more thing the car is absolutely beautiful beyond dope but, if it were mine, ;-);-) I believe there's too much carbon fiber on the bonnet and I would paint that just a little raised area in the middle to match the rest of the car. Just my opinion like I said it's already very beautiful
Beautiful paint cor choice and a fantastic build!  I probably would've chosen to paint the front wing, but leave the carbon fiber exposed on the wing vents.   Great job, guys!
The wheels hurt my eyes, but the car looks fantastic
Loving the color, the build. Not a fan of the wheels though. Whatever do what your heart desires Matt you’re incredible!!
What did it end up being, the old Mclaren weeping turbo issue?
THE WHITE RING on the whells ... doesn't look right. but the rest of the car... DAMN!!!
Engine very bad
The wheels remind me of the ones on strads pink lambo... They have pink insted of white... It looks sick for sure...
This is the craziest McLaren I’ve seen
Watching your videos motivate me to keep my N54 335i 😮‍💨💀 Iykyk
Those wheels are freaking awesome 😎 suits it
The lid 😂
1920's gangster spats
Hey Matt, I'm thinking that you should perhaps give that car away to one of your subscribers, maybe somebody who's watched all your videos on building the car who knows the hell you've went through and understands the love and dedication that takes takes, and maybe even a Canadian who has had a tough couple of years with a prime minister who's persecuted the entire country and has no Freedom anymore except maybe for a few moments of driving a exceptionally amazing McLaren down the road and feeling the freedom of that....at least for a little while...
Absolutely loving the colour, it reminds me of the blue 3 wheeler uk government issued 'cripple cars' which us in our fifties can just about remember. Still, it looks stunning on the Mac with the black and carbon. Here's hoping the bit of fun hasn't cost you an engine. Fair play to Tony being there so fast with a fire extinguisher 🧯 should it have been needed.
Big up mat Armstrong
Great car in a great colour but sorry those wheels let it down
Nice job as always! I don't like the wings though tbh. I think they should be painted mint green.
It is almost comical thay the car punished you for those hideous wheels...
I feel like you should paint the fenders but mask off the vents and leave them carbon fiber
Matt went to Florida and built a Miami Dolphins tribute car 😂.
The wheels need changing ! They look tiny due to the design. The car body looks good it’s a nice colour but the wings need to be body coloured !
I’ve had friends who’s 720s just loved blowing up randomly They sold the car before warranty is up
You lied to Hammond lol
YEAH..... na! Looks like a poorly designed kit car. Love you Matt and the show but I am sure that deep down you feel the same about the aftermarket panels and wheels. Hard pass for me
You’ve out-done yourself and every other build. The colour, although looked doubtful at first looks brilliant and the new wheels are a real in-your-face,to most other builders that can only see black! I hope the smoke problem is just a loose bolt or something equally simple, you deserve at least one break for all the work you’ve put in.
Rims style look different but awesome... Though i find the white jarring... maybe changing the colour from white to mint to tie things in better? Ohh noo the engine!!! Hope fully u get it back up and running soon!
Government sucks and steals money from people around the world registration is a scam
I love the wheels, love the colour but those little carbon vented side panels need to be the same colour as the car !!
This car is a stradman speck for sure crazy color carbon fiber and wheels look just like the ones on his full carbon lambo
Pls Matt, The white part of the wheels should be same as the body color
Loose the white rings on the wheels. Otherwise, the car looks amazing!
Hey really love the coulor U choose, do you plan to add some mint flavor stribes at the rims and Bonnet ? I guess i could Look great 31:46  Like one the Sharp edges to make IT Look Like a shark
Looks absolutely amazing, although I would paint the front wings. 🔥🔥👍
Digging the colour, not the wheels, but nice job getting it all put back together. A huge amount of work
id rather see bolts and be able to replace than have permanent damage that cant be repaired or replaced
Isn’t the wheel design the same stradmans lambo aventandor the pink one ?
This extra touches is what make you brother. Awesome build
Diffuser makes it a Batman car!!!! Awesome mate!
First build I’ve seen that looks terrible, sorry but those wheels, more specifically the white protectors just ruin a beautiful car, please at least consider painting them to match the rims.
Sea shanties🤣
Looks good
OEM wheels was better, but the car is yours lol... Nice build Mat... Keep it up
Nice car wk I'll u be giving it away
That looks Mint-al!
The wheels make it look like it has white-wall tires.
Colour match the outer wheel ring/trim!
Good work all  👏 👍 👌 love it like 👍
Let me guess, the alloys will make the car. Oh, hang on. Nevermind eh.
Those wheels are hideous, please change them to some silver ones or brushed aluminum ones in the future video,  And lose that weird disc thing around the perimeter
*I swear this dude keeps saying "Waifu". 😂*
Oh man what a beautiful car . Right up to the point that you put those wheels on.
ive always wondered if Mat was a mechanic who fixes other peoples cars aswell or if he just fixes cars for Yt
absolutly insane!!! I loved how you left it, greetings from Patagonia, Argentina
Nice work the car looks mental as you would say! And then there's that!
Damn bro even tho the car caught flames I still love the dedication you put into it. I love your videos Matt 😎
From the front it looks like Baby Shark, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo 🦈 😝
Not the wheels 😢
Wheels are ... no
Who else thinks Mat Armstrong is the best automotive youtuber?
Mat and team... 💯 stunning!!!! Fantastic achievement!!!   Love the colour, carb.fibre contrasts, and the wheels are .... superb!  Infact, super gangsta 😂  Fingers crossed for the engine, you probably left an oily rag in it... 😮😢😂   Good luck. 👍 👌 👏 😋
Traduction espagnole s'il vous plaît merci
Those wheels are whack. Totally ruined the car.
Subscriber since just before a million. Your growth has been exponential and it's completely deserving. I'm happy to admit I've spent hours watching your videos and enjoyed every minute of it. I hope your growth continues, you deserve it.
the car looks great Mat thank you for yet another great rebuild series
Not a big fan of the wheels, makes it look like white walls and you never put white walls on a super car, same color as the car or even a carbon fiber ring would of been much better...IMO!!!
This McLaren reminds me of something I would’ve done in GTA V, modifying the T20 🤣 looks absolutely mental
Hey Mat, didn’t think you could top the previous builds until watching this vid. Smashed it congratulations to you, Tony and the team
Minty fresh 👎 Tiffany Blue 👍
Love the  color.
Wheels very bad
The wheels really make that car, I love them
Matt  love your videos but the colour and the wheels on this car = Fail
Let me tell ya, Matt. Watching your channel lately has really been a pleasure. Also, learning more about your past from BMX racing to now YT influencer was really interesting. You stay true to what you're capable of doing and learn along the way. The relationship with your father is really special. What a great man. He has raised a great son as well. Kudos to the rest of the team as well. Keep up the great content, mate!
Those wheels though🔥
With ALL rebuilds, especially the exotics, keep a halotron fire extinguisher in the cars. 😊
I love it. The mint green is amazing
love you, hanna, your dad and kevin. wheels have got to go brother. peace
-5° lol here in Alberta -50 last week 😅
You imported a mclaren to the UK? See how you are?
It wouldn't be a MA vid if the engine didn't throw the towel in just before it was all good to go. On the plus side we get another video or 2 now of the mclaren so that's a positive.
Futility of futilities, all is futility🐙🐚
Spanish translation please
At 10:31 is it meant to sound like that
Great work Matt can't wait to see Harold's face..brilliant
Lego widgets
Love the colour awesome.
Superb car,superb colour..as for wheels......YUK!!!! What a waste of money...stick to the standard wheels...so so much better standard
🐵🐒🙊🙉🙈cheeky
Guys you're going great and great episode after episode.
love the colour!!!
You sir, are freaking champion of the people!
Fantastic job, but that colour? It looks like somebody threw up on the Batmobile! Very 1990s House of Kolor Pastel shade. It looked shite then as well......
The exo version😂🎉
I passed you on the way to Wheelmania last week and that colour is so much better in real life!
I would’ve done a full chrome face for this color; but those wheels are insane. Hats off to Mat and Tony, yall are nuts
I love the colour and the wheels really match. Yes, paint the front guards body colour. To me this looks really 1930's retro art deco.
Colour good, wheels bad.
This is what sex looks like that color and wheels 🤌 chefs kiss
dunno if i like the carbon wings but means fast
I was so excited with the whole project until the time you put  the new wheels on ,i think its better to get another two in front like the old ones back, btw  very good job ,gredits to all and keep working hard!!!
Looks like an invalid car from the 70s. 🤮 I appreciate you won't know what they were.
*Like if you want the Piano music banned!*
Looks like strad wheels on the dark pink aventador
Hi ✌🏼
The car looks absolutely gorgeous 😍😍
In German the hood isn’t called “decko” or how it’s written but “Motorhaube“. I’ve never even heard decko. But that’s just a small detail in a great video. Great work as always!❤
Matt, Once again you Nailed it. Sema Quality.
*Great build, not a fan of those wheels you had made just not a fan of that style, the rear wheels that were on it looked 100 times better imo*
The ZACOE widebody kit looks so crazy for the 720s tho. Should have went that route.
Look for "shark teeth" fot your front bumper please, it will look mental
I'm one the 50% negatives on those wheels, they don't suit it at all IMO.....but overall, the car looks sick, great job!
Matt the wheels are beautiful mate ❤
Traducción a español por favor
Mat, your journey is unbelievable. The difference is not only in your video editing but in yourself, your confidence is ten fold. Now…the car, oh dear 😂 colour not great but those ‘Stradman’ wheels are absolutely mingin! Amazing job otherwise though.
Insane color mat love it and those wheels make it totally 1 of a kind
what happened to engine?
he said the rims can come off if you curb it... get some more rims and paint them the body colour???
Wish wheels were different but in general this is nice af
Looks good, except the carbon fiber fenders break the flow of the body. I would partially paint it so the 'vents' remain carbon and the outside is turquoise. Edit: The wheels are not my thing, but it's you who has to like it.
Love the build. Fair play. But the wheels. Maybe mint the white.  But other than that faultless. 👍
The color combo looks amazing but the wheels ain't doing it for me Matt, sorry lad!
Terrible wheels Brembo gold wheels would be better
loving the wheels 🔥
Mat this effort is monumental…but, you lost me at the end with that colour and those wheels. I know you had a vision but this one is going to take some explaining. Lol.
Awesome job
YFood needs to ro ship to the US...  Love the teal n carbon look though 💪🏼💯🔥🔥🎉🎉🎉🎉
You know that saying "don't try to reinvent the wheel".....stick to rebuilding, not designing.
Love the video! should be incredibly proud! also love the music to! great choice!
Amazing car ruined by those wheels
Next build please a rolls royce 🎉
Sick car just them wheels ruin it for me i prefer the oem but it’s not my car so 😂
Og wheels looked good on it
The way my jaw dropped seeing that colour 😮
I think the problem with the engine caused by the oil filter or it was overfilled
That diffuser is a work of art!
The British tavarish
Mat did not learn from Freddie. Fixes mclaren, drives it hard on private road to show it off, blows the engine 😂 silly boy
You were mistaken about the best looking car in the collection. It’s actually the RS6 😁
Lol GTA modded car
Awesome build. Looks like it rolled of the set of Tron. Probably as fast. A+++++ video
whys it mint because it is int it love it
Looks a bit ricer with the wings unpainted.   That car came with carbon wings.
Beautiful car love the wheels only thing to make them better for the white rings painted mint like the car
It's not a Deckel. It's a Haube!
Those wheels look crazy good
… the BEST of all the cars….!!! 👍🙂👍🙂👍🙂
absolutely gorgeous piece of gear, great job mate
Ohhh man Matt. Can you bring it to Canada onetime please. That is my son’s fav car and you have made a masterpiece again. I mean you do a wicked job but this takes the cake mate. Fantastic job guys
Nearly 750k views in 6 hours 😳
Coming along nicely... Not a fan of the wheels but hey Mats car Mats choice. Hope the engine isn't junked.
I'm not feeling this build. The colour scheme isn't sitting well with me - and what's with the blinking kitty cat face rear end at 21:20 ? I can't unsee it. Carbon bonnet doesn't work either. Should be all one colour.
Mat, you are just to the moon with what you do!!!  Incredible build.  Wonder what's smokin'??
The car looks insane. Great job Mat. It is Minty 👍😂😅
I love the colour but them rings on the wheels make it look like your running white walled tyres off a hot rod 😖👎
When u revealed the color i was like okay maybe… but when u revealed the rims i was like yea no this dude fkd this beautiful car with ugly color and even uglier rims but other than that love the content keep it up
Man can't believe it i fucking yell when i see the smoke NOooooooo ! As usual it's not the first time happened to you and your dad. Im confident you going to fix it ! Wheel are one of kind for sure ! Wowo !
Car looks AMAZING!!!
Haha Mat talking over himself mid-video is actually hilarious. Need this 720 next to DDE's 720 once it's done!
Maybe add a white racing strip to blend in the wheels!!
Plz change either the color or interior...and them wheels...😢
Still on the fence re the wheels.🤔🤔🤔🤔
You have to colour match the front fenders. Looks weird with the brake in the flow of the body lines with the dark fenders.
Some crazy good work  crew, great insight into how these cars are put together..Colour looks sick  with carbon trim..mental lads
I never thought it would look beautiful but mat u done a great job and good luck with the new BMW 👍🔥🔥🔥🔥
You turned it into a hairdresser  car with that color,,😮 your right not another  like that ,it's horrible 😮
Stunning  treatment apart from the colour on the wheels,  ( you were right , but an easy fix to correct ). Love the channel.
Amazing job ....hate the wheels though
i like the color, i lke the carbon kit,  i really dont like the wheels, the white thing on them dont match anything on the car  i think you should paint a little part of the carbon front fenders green to flow with the car
The fins that guide air into the brakes on the wheels id color them the same as the blue on the car and it’ll look amazing 👌
Sorry Matt really don’t like the wheels
Them wheels 🤢 🤢 🤢
One thing about Matt, he’ll always choose the most heinous color and wheels 😅
British have a strange thing with mint... And those wheels 🤢 Anyway, nice work, too bad for the engine.
Crazy cool car !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nope, don't like the wheels colour.  Specially not with the orange stripes of the interior. Your car is now all over the place colourwise....
Incredible colour, looks unbelievable. Best yet, well done guys. 👍👍👍👍👍
Love the colour, hate the wheels, another great build though Mat
I don’t like the colour, the wheels don’t suit the car and I noticed the editing error!! But I won’t stop watching! Keep on keeping on!
Mat just messed up the car with those wheels, come on Mat…you come a long way to make the car look like that, the OEM wheels are by far a million times best looking, please review those wheels Mat, please!!!
Love the color! Bold and unique. Did you think about painting the white rims the body color?
Mat m8 you’ve done it once again, no one, no car, no problem can ever stop you… another banger 🎉
The colour doesn't look sick....it looks like someone's sick.
I’m not feeling the color!
Wow those wheels are brilliant. They slightly reminded me of the golf P alloys ( well the outer rim atleast) love the car hope it’s not a bad fix!
Time to upgrade the engine and paint the calipers. Sick build, Mat!
I wish you still did one cheaper car project ehilst doing the supercars like the type of cars you did when you first started.
I'm sorry. You lost me on this one. Those wheels, that colour and with gray carbon is such a bad match😵‍💫
Wheels and tyres maketh or breaketh a car…
That color is not going to age well.
Outside piece on the wheel in carbon would be unreal
The white on the rim should have been orange And you need a paint on Fender.
Tron car😂
hii
the wheels 🤮
Jusr finish watch it, hope the engine not gone  bad..finger crossed
Imagine how smart you have to be tplo completely rebuild one of these. Cant just look up how the door goes together on YouTube
Wheels are a no from me, the white wall makes them look smaller than they are
Loved the mint paint and the rims. Paint the calibers white and change the orange interior to white and the seatbelts aswell then it’s perfect… otherwise sell it to Shmee he would love all those different colors mixed together 😂
Once again Mate! Awesome content. I was a little ...'errmmm hows your father' about the wheels but will let it grow on me. GREAT JOB MAN!!!! Hope the Engine is OK!!
Best car build eva
I predict an engine coming back out!
Mat love the colour love the wheels love the vids wot a car best Mclaren I have ever seen I look forward to every clip you put out you and your family Deserve everything you have worked for 👍👍
That car is literally 🔥 haha
Hannah’s van needs a diffuser that big. Maybe even bigger 👀👀👀
A build is something that’s yours and noone should have anything to say anything about it.
Love this build Mat, the minty paint and the carbon - sick - but those wheels !!!! Man the white kills it, sorry to be negative but they blow
Awesome job Mat! You and your Dad are such a great team. Love the show and the car looks great! …… apart from those wheels. It kind of looks like in Back To The Future 3, when they put white walls on the DeLorean, it just looked weird. Hope the engine is okay? Looking forward to the next episode. Keep up the great work!
The wheels go so hard. Also the carbon panels. Make the interior white if u can
I prefer the original colour
Hate the color and the wheels but none of us are here for that, I'm just excited to see it completed, hope that engine gets sorted, that smoke was a bummer.
Matt please paint the wheels all black that white part not happening!
Jesus thats a beatiful white, lets try to keep it white and dont get to much smoke on the panels :D
The carbon bonnet has a transformers face 😮
The wheels are just wrong there...
You shouldn’t paint the top glass windows and just mame slmr kind of system where u can take it off anytime you want but they’re still secure that’s be so cool.
Wheels dont Match withh 3rd color
sorta dissapointed you didnt go with a deep purple when u already had the orange details.
Audio went wonky @10:30. Color looks sick.
Sorry those wheels ain't it
Needs a white pinstripe
The wheels are very subjective and also a personal preference and opinion, but I have to say .... no for the wheels. These types of wheels don't even look good on a new 911 GT2/3.
yfood is bullshit/not good for you. Has seed oils, oat fiber (chelates and steals nutrients that your body doesn't absorb), emulsifiers and gums that irritate your gut/cause inflammation and sucralose.
Please break down cost for us mere mortals wanting to rebuild something like this
looks like a clown with those wheels
The poor car committed hari kari when it realised what it looked like! 😅
Looks like fuel injectors stuck open
I agree looks sick! 🤢 🤮 . But it's all in the eyes of the beholder! Right
That’s just McLaren engines man they will catch on fire at any given moment 😭
Awful wheels
Wheels suck 🤷‍♀️
Love your videos Mat! But come on man, those wheels are awful😂 you can do better than that!
the only channel videos which I don't skip 😊
Hammond will b calling u a plonker lmao
Car looks perfect 🔥🔥🔥 except for the white on the wheels but as you says its your care you made it at your tast
Straight out of gta 6, bueatiful 👍
Matt, I have been rebuilding and restoring a 1974 914 with all of the trials and tribulations you would expect of a 50 year old car but your work is just on another level! On top of that, the vids are fantastic. You have me thinking about Ca4bon panels re front trunk, rear trunk and roof panel…..more fun!
I love the car… my dream is to get a 720s.. congrats Matt all the hard work paid off 🫡
Best video to date !
everything is great on the car in the video you said In the comments people are going 50 50 and im the halve that loves it
❤ love that car
Sorry but the wheels don't work,  they don't suit the car. Remove the odd white bit surrounding the wheel and they will be sweet.
Really like the paint color, but look similar to tavarish one, but need to change the wheel tough 😅😊😊 what a weeks wait for yr video from Malaysia mat
Like the colour but i think the carbon over the wheel arch is too much, just the bonnet would have been perfect. Wheels are 100% marmite, don't think they suit this car. Epic build though, hope you're keeping it for yourself!
Tron!
🎉🎉🎉Fire Paint not sure on wheels its funny how people cant resist the urge to go full send on first drive, I guess nobody learned from Jake Paul an what happened to his new Ferrari 😂
Deckel ? 😂 more like Motorhaube 😅
i think you should call it the TRON mclaren as that what it reminds me of
03:15 sounds like audio from a song called me time by Eli fross😅
Car was looking beautiful until you put those God Awful wheels on it. Should of left the black ones on it!!!😢😢
🔥
Lo siento pero no me gusta.....
Sorry matt, looks cheap....its like a bangers car ...
Looks better than Tavarish's Matt!
It is not „Deckel“ in german (at least nobody calls it like that). It is „Haube“ or „Motorhaube“.  Love the channel🔥
with the wheels you should have done carbon with the greyish trim being pain to match the car colour
Wheels are horrendous !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not even sorry !!  the car even thought so by trying to burn its self
Love it! Amazing colour! Fantastic build! Personally I hate the wheels, but I’m sure I’m in the minority! Well done guys!!!🎉
Great build! Shame about the new wheels though 😢
Bc you say "if you German" The bonnet is called "Motorhaube" or just "Haube"  and But what we actually mean by "Deckel"  is the lid of the trunk because its called Kofferaum-DECKEL
This car looks fire 🔥🔥🔥. Especially those rims and the color.
19:17 I'm sorry, but the Aston Vantage is the best looking car in your collection.
Colour looks good. Wheels look like gay whitewalls lol. Hope the engine isn't very bad guys 🙏
Nice work! Love the color and everything.. except the wheels. Those got to go!
18:04 in German it's Motorhaube not decal.
The wheel would look better without the white aero piece. It looks like they are removable tho. It turned out great tho. The paint and carbon kit 🤌
Hell no on the rims
I think it looks incredible! The wheels are fantastic I love the white part that can be swapped incase of damage, reminds of a car from Tron 😮
Colours nice wheels are terrible
90% of the time it will sit in the garage 8% of the time it’s broke an 2% of the time it lets you know why you wanted one
The colour is great
I ve think you did a "tavarisch"..
that is sick ❤
Now then , Matts dad Tony  said "where's those Polo mints gone I had earlier?", Matt replied ,"dad over there on the wheels "😂😂😂, looks very nice , hope the engine problem is not expensive after all that hard work guys 👍
Honestly paint is amazing. Wheels are woeful. But it aint my csr
It's really funny to me that Matt thinks Deckel means Bonnet 🤣 (It's just a lid, bonnet is called Motorhaube)
actualy very good mix with the wheels and the hood
The car is straight out of “TRON”….I love it….
20:25 Let's have a look...👹👹OOOOOOOOHHH👹👹
Loved that colour since Leyton House ran their F1 cars in it ❤
Awesome car! Well Done. Good luck for the engine. WHeels not mine in white but i understand it. for me the white in carbon. greetz
The Turbo ist gone i Think
Great job but change the wheels.  What are you thinking
Hi matt love the content I want to know do you name the cars ? Please let me name the c63 it's my favourite
Love the car but the look like you got them from a Tesla 😅
@mattarmstrongbmx you’ve encouraged me to go out and start my own YouTube channel rebuilding and repairing my cars and I love doing it. Have you any advice as it doesn’t seem to be going in the direction I hoped it would. Keep up the work love your content
32:00 was that before the test drive? 😂
I wanna see what Hammond would say about the "DEFINITELY NO ISSUE" statement you put. hahaha 😂😂😂
Car looks phenomenal. Not sure about wheels but I don't own it 😂
Those wheels look sick, i would paint the plate the same color as the inner part of the rim but it looks cool how it is too
What a beautiful project! I would personally go for all gloss black wheels…but I would say that you have a fine taste either way. Cheers!
Where's Richard Hammond's comment?! Came here for it!
Those wheels are awful / gopping. Utterly destroys the look of the car! The stock 720s wheels looked far better
Malaysia 🇲🇾✅
Please buy a GTR r35
You've made a mclaren in to a polo. Love the minty fresh body colour, but the round white wheels make me want a mint with a hole... this has to be a trick right? Next sponsor rowntree??
Aahh maan, should have known better, such a performance car you should have let it warm up the oils and everything to operating temperature before revving it up, i’m not really sure how this common sense got forgot that easily 😅
It needs the wings painted to match the body IMO. Otherwise, I think it looks great!
Like the carbon, wheels 🤔
I'm assuming after that colour reveal that you're giving the McLaren to Hannah now?
Another fantastic build, not a fan of the wheels but each to their own. Keep it up 👍🏼
Btw. In Germany it isn Called „Deckel“ its Called „Motorhaube“ Yeah i know kinda difficult. Just to get things right!! :)
YES YES YES Mat, a very beautiful again guys
Very nice
What happened to the fire
I love how it looks!! Great work !!
I'm pretty sure that Mclaren hates the color. OMG what were you thinking dude seriously (minty fresh) WTH. That Mclaren is feeling like a flabby woof woof. LMAO. You could've done soooooo much better like a volcano lava color to complement the inside trim. It would've been SPECTACULAR!
Love the colour you have done an awesome job, not sure about the wheels, though they look a bit too small, but hey its your car and as long as you love it thats all that matters! Keep up the great work!! 👍
Insane!!!!
I don't know why I was thinking orange but minty fresh looks awesome😊
Missed opportunity to paint the edge of the wheels with the same color as the body.
I no your a profesional, dont flor it after rebuilding it.
❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hey Mat, the bonnet is called Haube in german not Deckel. A Deckel is what closes all bottles like your WI foot.
i think you should paint the fenders but leave the vents exposed carbon
personally I don't like the wheels and the fender. Should have the same color as the rest. At least on the side. But awesome project and awesome video. enjoyed every minute of it 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
6:05 Hearing Mat pronounce adhesive made my brain explode 🤯 lol
Awesome paint but the wheels? Noooooooooooooo
Hey Matt, you should consider painting the white ring on the rims in the Body colour! 😉
Mint green???? Did we get the idea from AdamLZ and his vintage Porsche 911?  😊
Your just amazing with what you do to written off cars and make them look awesome... God bless your work
That color is gorgeous, it reminds me of the old late 90s and early 00s MB S-Class color option of Chalcedon Blue Pearl....was a powder blue pearl and I wanted an S65 in that color with tan leather so damn bad 😅  Edit: I definitely would've painted the "beadlocks"/"aerorings" to match the powder blue paint instead of white.... give it a thought  Edit again: that smoke.... didn't look good, I know it was cold out, but that looked either like blown head gaskets, or an overfilled dry sump oiling system, which would explain the fire, oil was burning due to the oil being overfilled, car does it's signature decell backfire and ignites the oil coming out of the exhaust, huge plume of smoke.... that's my only current conclusion
Please colour match the front fenders
The design is neither here nor there, good to be bold and I quite like that. But those ill-fitting aftermarket kits will never win me over. They just don't fit up and you could see how bad it was in a couple of the shots.
Thè colour is couñcil house bathroom great show thanks
I can sort of understand leaving the bonnet and rear wing in bare carbon fibre, but please paint the front wings - it looks unfinished and daft. Same goes for the wheels - the rims are ok, but lose the silly white bits...You can't leave it looking that amateur.
The wheels are CRAAAZYY AWESOME!
In germany the engine hood isnt a 'Deckel' . It is a Motorhaube so Haube would be the correct noun :)
I would paint the white thing on the wheels  also mint.
Personally id get the white on the rims to paint match the body
I really like the colour I painted a vw beetle a very very similar colour back in the day . Like the wheels to good choice Matt 👍
I’m pretty sure that certain panel gaps are to allow slight body movement when at high speed due to the weight the down force creates on the body
All that effort,then you paint it that and put those wheels on. good vid all the same.
The wheels  are  a joke
With those wheels it looks like something out of TRON ❤
I like it. The fenders not matching may be a bit much. But its your style!!
Was changing my mind about the color once all the parts were on but big no to the wheels the white looks lost.
Love it ! Feel bad for you the way it ended . Hopefully something silly like a turbo and the the actual engine 🤞
This car look absolutely sick. I love it.
Yeah i dont like the wheels, I have alot nicer ones on my imaginary Mclaren😂
Them wheels are terrible
Love the car and colour hate the wheels LOL 😢
Well done mate not fan of the wheels tho
Great video Matt. Wings definitely need colour matching to the rest of the car, maybe leave the ducting in carbon. Wheels are absolutely insane and definitely suit the car!
Carbon looks incredible
The white part of the wheel should be painted either the body color or the orange color on the seats.
Sorry Matt it looked stunning before you put those wheels on
Yeah matt them wheels aint it😢
Absolutely love the colour, it’s the exact same as my first Nintendo DS back in 2010 lol
colour has grown on me quickly, but those wheels are awful.
When in doubt, shim it out
damn , super lucky the exhaust wasnt even hotter, otherwise it wouldve been instant
Love the look shout to u n ur work  Isaac from 758 st Lucia 🇱🇨
Love the color, but those carbon front fenders really interrupt the flow and should be body colored. Unless I’m just not seeing the vision.
It is "Haube", if you are german! 🙂
Not sure on the wheels but not my car lol, everything else for me is spot on though! Keep the vids coming guys 👍
Bro, Richard Hammond…..
Matt wills did it first 😂
Hmmm not sure the wheels or colour works for me, but like you say it's personal to you so cracking effort Mat, just need to get a new engine now 😂
It looks amazing. But can you please stop going full send right after starting the cars? Warm it up a little bit before you send it. Probably not the issue, but cold engine and full send is probably not good either.
😍😍 My dream car that is stunning Mat you have definitely made this one a one of a kind! 👍👍
You  come so far  mat I love  your  videos  I always  check  on YouTube  to see  you  uploaded  a video  keep  going  with  the  hard  work  you  come  a long  way  you  use to be  a bmx  rider  and  now a big dream  car builder  my biggest  dream  is meting  you  sorry  if my  spelling is bad  I got  special needs I just  wish  I can  meet  you  and  see all your  cars
Colour amazing.  Wheels not sure, if there was white elsewhere on the car (apart from the smoke) but looks out of place.  Avoid speed bumps at all costs 😂
I actually made a squeaking noise when I saw the wheels. I fucking love them. It’s like a classic hot rod white wall look
Great build but wings need painting and those rims need to be body coloured
How will the paint shop cut and polish the paint back with the new carbon parts glued on ?
Hi Matt, this is Shailendra from India, I have watched all ur videos , all of them are amazing to watch down to the last detail, as an architect this is what we look for , absolute perfection and that's  what u have managed to do, the McLaren looks absolutely amazing colour wise but I am not really happy with the wheels especially the white trimming on the edge. GOOD LUCK TO THIS PROJECT
I love it, but never watched that many adds in my life. 😒
Well .....
Never goes smoothly in any video but that always means another one quickly round the corner. Great colour choice
The most hideous wheels I’ve ever seen
I think the wheels look hideous and appear really small because of the 2 tones. They definitely let down the otherwise amazing kit.
Perhaps you can use this car for grilling hot dogs?
Love the colour is so unique from McLaren I have seen . From 🇿🇦
Stunning colour, hate the wheels. As you said, it's your choice and taste. It's been a brilliant rebuild. Hope it's just a dodgy sensor or a simple fix on the engine 👏👏
I'm always open to new and creative ideas, but these rims don't fit at all.
This is GTA garage all over 🥵🔥🔥
Or Deckel it you are german. I am german and Deckel is definitly not right. Its called Motorhaube 🤓
Another awesome build! Now just hope that smoke is an easy fix !! :-( O, and I dont need to take my 1989 BMW Z1 to the paint shop to get it painted either! just all the panels ETC as all unbolts🙂
The wheels definitely ruin it. But otherwise great build, the color looks great!!
this looks like a car made in TRON
Top work fellas as usual bold wheel choice I’m not sure it will grow on me looks likes a Tron car keep at it lads
the colour looks so gooooood!!!!
Thanks to Mat we are starting our own YouTube channel about rebuilding cars we are not the best in making videos but we trying our best so come to see us in our channel we appreciate your views
great looking car but them white things on the wheels make them look cheap and tacky. unbolt them it will look so much better.
Not sure I love the mint color, but I’m glad you do. Looking forward to seeing a little less smoke exiting from the exhaust.  Good luck.
It beautiful true work of art
Stars man has those rims but there pink
Well after tavaris and now this I’m officially never buying a Mc Claren
That's an L on the wheels 🤦
We need an "engine very bad" light on the dash
18:02  "Deckel" just means "lid"
This Beast somehow looks like it came straight out of TRON 👌
Great achievement. I hope the oil level on the engine needs adjusting? I'm around your dad's age so your choice of colour is not for me, the wheels do the car no justice at all. However it's your car, you love it no other gratification needed. I'll never own one that's for God damn sure 😢👍👍😞
10:37. There are two vocals overlapping. Just thought I’d say. 😂
18:00  In Germany it's called "Motorhaube", simply meaning engine hood/cover
rims not good bro,
Wheels make it look like an electric car concept!! Great build though ❤
Everything but the wheels 💆🏾‍♂️
This is sick 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
McLaren loves using shims  So body parts don't line up add shims. As for the carbon fiber parts I would have went 109% parts
Think the front wings should of gone Mint and agree the wheel white Into Mint also....Look forward to the next vid Big up Tony and all crews
Wow the car looks amazing love the colour . What an amazing achievement . You blow me away with all your videos
The white circles on the wheels make the wheels look disproportionately small for the car.
Wheels are not good!  Paint the wings  Incase you missed the first part wheels are not good. Please fix.  Love everything you guys do! Expect the wheels. Lol
Meanwhile in USA ? Audi?
Carbon fenders coulor suck's in  this Mclaren  . Too much Carbon. Paint the fenders with rest colour of  car leave a bonet with Carbon look and it will be looking so mutch better ...
Bro please do a Trx you will love it
51k likes in 5 hours your smashing it mat love the new content miss the hot hatches tho need a fiesta st or something on the channel a bit more relatable
Worked on my 2 stroke bike engine while waiting for this - blew a wrist pin clip broke the whole cylinder and piston - sat there like 😐😮  Then you posted lmao
Türkiye için dublajlı video kanalı açarsan çok tutar Türkiye tam bir araba içeriğine aç bir ülke değelendirmelisin
Love this color,  sickest mclaren ever, however wheels imho does not match. Great job!
Sorry matt, great looking car But those wheels are naf
Remove the white rings on the wheels and its perfect! Those rings only make the wheels look really small...
Your dad in the advert matt was hilarious
I think the car came out amazing not sure the wheels are my cup of tea but thats what makes car stuff so fun you can do what ever you want to your own car. Still one hell of an achievement you should be proud
Sorry I love the whole car apart from them wheels and maybe the carbon panels but I could live with the panels but the wheels 😵‍💫😵‍💫
Sorry but i'm not digging the wheels  I like everything else  i think is great
Colour and wheels look amazing! Very Tron
I don't think the colour suits the car. Should be black. I don't like the rims either. Let it burn.🔥🔥
Interesting wheels, could be bigger
TRON vibes. It’s dope.
Looks great! I think the wings would look great in mint to tie the front together with the rest but looks solid anyway! Hope the engine is sorted quickly thats more important 🙏
Thought the colour would kill it. Absolute top effort as always
The mint body colour is a superb choice and looks amazing. Not sure about the carbon bonnet and front wings. I would have just painted everything mint green including the spoiler. Incredibly disappointed with the wheels though. I think they look absolutely awful and spoil the look of the whole car. As somebody else in the comments said, the surrounds make the wheels look really small and the white doesnt tie in with anything else on the car. However, if MA is happy with it that's all that matters.
Awesome....the wheels could be better even if you had the white there but much smaller than it is now makes it look small and cheap now even though it's not
Wheel look sick but I think the white part needs to be body colour
Mat what was the cause of the fire and is the engine ok ? Absolute amazing project
Certainly different looking, it reminds me of the cars in Tron 😎👌
Fantastic Mat! At least someone is making good progress with a McLaren!
That white on the wheels, if I was doing it and wanted to stand out. Make the white on the rim the same mint color as the car and leave center black... But beautiful!! Great job!!
You're the only YouTuber I genuinely got worried about because you weren't posting for 10 days or so. Can not explain you just how much you inspire me. I will meet you someday I promise you that.
Those wheels are horrendous 🤣 Love it tho
Turbo may have gone by the looks of it
The rims are so fucking small😂
Wheels are terrible mat sorry😮
Wow. Just wow.
I wish I could order yfood.  I just trying placing a 10 case order but they don’t ship to the USA 😢😢 was trying to order a lot for the signed brake disc :(  plus to try this delicious meal replacement considering I never have time to eat 😂
You should put a “MASO” on the car, for Mat Armstrong Special Operations
Wheels are dope man but the white don’t match
Beautiful 😍 but mobility scooter came to mind...
I think Car Gods are punishing you for those wheels. Other than that ugly white trip, this car looks amazing. Well done
Dude those wheels really set it all off, not what i expected at all but it works!
Bro such karma😂😢
Car looked phenomenal till the wheels went on.
Car looks stunning, not a big fan of the wheels, it makes it look like the electric crap from Tesla..
The car looks sick! The colour is defo out there but it really works for me... especially with the carbon add ons! As for the wheels, not the kind I would ever go for I think, but hey! To each their own 🤷🏻‍♂️ if you like them, that's all that matters! Anyway great job on the car as usual Mat, and keep us updated on the engine very bad situation! Hope it's not TOO bad!
It’s a no on the wheels, the white doesn’t suit.
Wheels are sick👍 good choice
What a build, amazing! 🙌 Not sure about the wheels though 🤷‍♂️
DECKEL ? motorhaube please.
I thought it had burned to the ground!!
The wheels are so bad, what a shame for such a beautiful car
HARD
my dude this is why you warm up your engine before flooring it.............................................
The white needs to come off those rims
Love this car the colour with the carbon mix and the the gloss black on the roof blending into the rear glass looks amazing, then the wheels !! WOW I wasn’t sure before they went on the car but now they are on that look sick !!! Love em. You boys have done a fantastic job and should be extremely proud of what you have achieved. !!! Keep up the amazing work boys
Love the colour, not so keen on the rims (they look like the old American wide whitewall tyres 🤭).
love your vids mat and team ..also kudos for not Wearing those bloody caps and sunglass inside like so many other car peoples feel is hot ..its not
The wheels are a absolute no no from me 🤢
Jesus these rims are fire
I always watch your videos from the beginning Mat, but this time I had to skip to see if there was a happy ending after reading the title 😱🔥. Hope it can be sorted easily.
Loose the wheel rims an youl be golden
why does he say the wheels are a one off when all the SEMA cars had the Rohana Forged RFG25 aerodisc Wheels which are the Exact wheels you had made by Wheelmania so nothing New, and as for the Mint colour WTF were you thinking it looks sh*t with carbon
Damn those wheels are frickin SICK. makes the whole thing look absolutely nuts!
Hood in German isn’t Deckel but Motorhaube.
How to ruin a car with just some wheels 😂
Been watching him for like 4 weeks now he hasn’t disappointed 👍🏿keep up the good work man
That’s the most hideous McLaren out there
That color is amazing!! The carbon fiber looks amazing!! Good job Matt and crew!
Mat loving the videos how about doing some videos on pimping out Hannah’s Transporter
Another great video ditch the white on the wheels tho they look like 15's 😂
Nice mint colour. Not so sure on wheel choice. Would have gone for a titanium or gunmetal multispoke myself to show off the brakes..
Another great vid! The wheels and colour make it look like a vehicle from Tron
All I heard was wifu.   I was very confused 😆
Looks like you forgot to take the wheel transporting protectors off. Other than that it's lovely
🙏👍
These wheels looks small due to these whitewalls although it is sick :)
Clever way with the sponsors to make us not skip the video. Hah nice man.
Keep going! You are doing a great job, very friendly videos, I can't wait for the next one!
Happy banana food sounds tasty 😋
Can you rebuild a Kia telluride please🙏🙏
looking slick! Love the white rings on the wheels!
It was going so well until the wheels.
How McLaren is treated as a high end luxury brand is the biggest con ever… Even Suzuki can nail panel gaps… Nice job promoting garbage carbon companies also, those panel gaps are so utterly horrific 😂
German is actually Motorhaube. Deckel is more the translation of (bottle)cap
Love the car but the wheels are awful
The wheels pulled this beauty together. Bloody georgous
OMG it's mind boggling !! I really hope the engine is not toast !
I love this car, but i just don't like the carbon fenders
Another great build Mat & team. The Wheels .... 🤔🤔 Wheelie ! 😁 Hope engine turns out to be a quick fix 🤞🤞🤞
This car looks amazing, my only opinion is that instead of white for the outside portion of the wheel, you should do orange.
Bold choice with the rims. Love the Color although the wings need some paint with carbon showing on the air aero ducts only.
Deffo need to take  the white trim off the wheels 😅
Mat’s videos are the best car repair videos in all of youtube.
Its Not Deckel it is „Motorhaube“ 😅😂
Those wheels make it look like an EV
Not so sure about the wheel choice but okay to each their own
Very cool car looks great mate but those wheels that white bit makes it look like it's got white wall tyres so love the car wheels not so much 🙈
Colour and body kit are amazing! Wheels 🤔
car colour reminds me of Chocolate Chip Ice-cream 😂😂😂😂
The color is outstanding mat I think you sould paint the fender the same color of the car well done ❤️
Love the colour looks ace , not a massive fan on the wheels but it isn’t my car … I’d still have them tho 😂😂
Mat your build quality is probably better tham mclaren too 😂
As soon as I saw the limited addition yfood I bought a crate, can’t wait for it to arrive because happy banana is the best.   Also, I would just like to say that no matter how bad my day is, watching one of your videos always makes it great, thanks so much 💙
Not sure about the wheels, but the body work is amazing
Wheels will get painted before long. Like Stradmans - but orange to match the interior.
you did all that work.. and then the wheels just fkd it
Amazing build Mat...hope the engine 'ist nein kaput'. Those rims are certainly unique...but do give off 50s American white-wall vibes....which may have been what you were going for?
Mate, this is a huge accomplishment. She is beautiful.
Stunning apart from the wheels which are mank 👎🏼🤮
I wish it was Mint and hot pink that would look insane! Wheels alone look strange but with the car they kind of fit in. I did not like the front carbon but then again with everything  in place it fits. The only thing I would add is hot pink details and hot pink wheels or maybe make carbon fiber hot pink and make it more "cyberpunky" That would make it perfect
oh god ,, those wheels like like crap
Sorry Matt but wheels need changing. However, colour looks 💯 but front fenders need to be same colour as the car
Nah that wheels 🤢🤮
COLOR NAME : Biohazard Hepatitis puke Racing Blue
Wheels reminds me of a Tron car. 👍
You've no luck mate 2 steps forward 1 back looks amazing wheels will take a bit off getting used too but at the end off the day it's your car You're choice
Engine very bad
So you got an inspiration for the wheels from the Stradman carbon lambo?
I love this specific McLaren, a car with history
Love that colour, it’s like Porsche green 👌🏻
Great work.... sorry about the engine.... wheels are not my style but love the exposed carbon front....  i really look forward to your vids...hope you get the engine sorted
Regardless what happens with the car. We are all here to see. We just love it
Do the white part of the wheels mint
Headgasket very very bad
Outstanding Job
10:30 editing issue
Yaaaaaa …… the wheels man ….. 🤢🤮🤢
Mat please make a roadtrip again. Maybe with your dad and his F430 and your GT3 🎉
Amazing looking car. Congrats on the hard work. Surprised the wheel rings weren't Minty to match the car to be honest.
I think the paint looks great with the carbon and the new wheels but I am not sure about the interior being the opposite color but it is your car and it still looks awesome
I didn't liked the color but the carbon fiber kit makes it look amazing.
Best colour and best car you've built hands down beautiful son!👌🔥🔥🔥but...... the wheels are hanging🤢
Hard pass on the wheels tho.
It’s the enthusiasm with which you guys work on your cars, makes me want to build stuff😁👍
@Tony Armstrong Sir, you’ve raised a fine son! You two make me wish I had the chance to be that close with my son. I lost him when he was just 19 and seeing the two of you together makes me miss him even more. You have an infectious, positive attitude and a smile that makes this old man smile and laugh with you. Cheers!
No need to change the door hinge, that small amount of heat wont affect the strength, maybe if it was glowing red hot
Amazing job, I love the colours but I’d think about changing the ring of the wheels from white to carbon fiber. It makes more sense in my opinion 👍🏻
That thing went faster than a rebuilt rx7 motor 😂 "and it's gone!"
Wheels are a no for me...  the white polo mint wheels and the mint colour wich is beautiful don't match..... needs aggressive wheels in my opinion ...... fully gloss white alloys aggression I would have chosen with your bank card !  😂
Make the wheels match the car.
Mat the wheels are killing me pls get out that white stuff
Nice job matty 👍🏾
Wheels should of been mint as well
That color is AMAZING
Oohh c'mon¡¡ pffff dont worry matt, you will save it, of course¡😂 it's look so amazing¡
Great episode Mat, the only thing I’d change is painting the front wings, looks amazing 👍🏼
Private road 😂😂😂😂  Hope an engine overhaul isn’t needed 👍
Think that smoke was,  the car saying,  me not likely my new shoes 😂
Hey Mat, love the vids. Just a quick one. In Germany we dont actually call it a Deckel, we call it a Motorhaube.
definitely no issues... lol. yea sure mate... time for a deep delve
TRON 720S
GP2 Engine GP2
Ooooo weeeee That's Siiiick love that colour..
the colour😍
No one’s 50/50 on the wheels it’s more 1/50 😂 😂😂😂
What a ugly wheels!!
Paint is epic.
Finlay Yay
18:03 bonnet in german actually means „motorhaube“ not „deckel“😂 greetings from germany🫶🏽🇩🇪
Overall the car looks amazing. The wheels...hideous.
Its beginning to look very nice, and you always choose nice wheels, but I don't like these wheels under this mclaren at all, might be because of the white rings, I guess you're gonna paint those rings when you paint the car right?
how do you bigger than this for the next car.... Bugatti? Koenigsegg?
I bought a few cases of this. I didn't believe in all these drinks before but been on it for over a week and I am feeling alot better than I was ! Happy Banana is awesome !!!!
i think this car is a peace of art will done mat thats awsome
최고입니다
Little sidenote „Deckel“ just means Lid. The Bonnet is called „Motorhaube“  Great Video, keep up the quality👍
Definitely missing out your signature Signing off Section.  "PEACE OUT ✌️
Them wheels look like there about to have some flashing lights out the holes 😂😂😂😂
I Will say, love the wheels, dont like them being while, i also dont like the full carbon fenders, id say paint the side ends of them same color as the car or wrap it. At the end of the day its your car, good work and keep it up
Amazing, the car wouldn’t look out of place in a Tron Movie! Love it!
First time?
The build is great, but without a doubt the wheels ruin it 100%,   Jaguar XJ220 springs to mind...   You got to change those wheels matt and blame hanna or something lol. imo its not even semi ok, its horrific lol,    The rest looks great tho even the colour.
Bloody awesome Matt such an inspiration.
The new wheels make it Tron legacy style
Front bumper would of been loads better black or carbon and me personaly the wheels 🤢🤢
Mat this car looks absolutely unreal you defo need to take this on a gumball get this car shown to the world it’s the best colour and the best Maclaren keep up the good work you are a legend
🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
matt gotta be honest them wheels are not it. maybe the white dont work
I love the color
Love channel, love the car, but....the split carbon front panels against the mint colour, for me, it doesn't work. And I'm sorry to say this, but those wheels are ugly as sin and do not suit the car at all. Just my opinion.
Colour  🤢
Those wheels should be fine once you’ve taken those white plastic protectors off.
who let bro cook, hands down the best 720s on the internet
Definitely Missing out your Signing off part  " Peace out".😅 ✌️
Love the car color and carbon wings. Negative on the goofy looking wheels. Fail.
another car saved from the tip, well done, looks awesome!
Hi boys , the mint kind of looks ok ,not sure about the carbon front , did the Audi R8 have Carbon parts showing ?, what can I say about the wheels only Mat could come up with a crazy design colour like that they are different that's about all I can say ,   The old Cornish petrol head .
Black wheels were a must. The white just doesn’t go IMO. Still a beast tho
Love the build and the colour, just not the wheels. Still I can always change them when I win it.....that's if it's not toast. Bring on the next blog 👍
Color is great, bit these wheels are ugly for that mclaren
Nice car 😮😮
I like the wheels, but the white rim being smaller than the alloy makes it look like it’s running small wheels.
Wheels are ugly,  sorry don't fit the car
No matter what the problem is they always laugh it off this is living life carefree 😂
Your channel is great Mat... Those wheels though... Your car bruv.
Stunning car and those wheels 🤤
Honestly I'd watch anything mat and his dad do. Even if they'd just repair junk cars yall are just the right duo and quite enjoyable. Hats off to you mat and pops.
Love it ❤❤❤
the wheels and the color suck!
Not gonna lie, I want to like the wheels…but I can’t 😅
Hi Matt and team. Just wanted to say thank you so much for today’s video. It gave me an escape for 30 mins from a truly horrific day. Thanks again and keep up the great work.
how much money did it take you to fix it all and to buy new parts
Matt, you have a talent of screwing cars in the end with the wheels.RS6, and now this. Please,for the good of our eyes , change them
Actually in germany we say „Motorhaube“ 🕺🏿
Motorhaube in german 🤟😛
Didn’t all that smoke happen to Dave’s car from DDE
It did look good until you put those wheels on!
The problem with the engine/box is the cars way of punishing you for putting those god aweful wheels on it 😂
That carbon kit looked like something out of a batman movie...
I'm so happy for u. Working hard on ur projects always pays off! Car is looking so good!
Car and colour look great - sorry - hate the wheels!
Awesome job! Awesome colour, awesome kit. Now I love you Mat but what on earth are you thinking with those wheels? They look awful, truly awful. You likey don't care but I hate them. The car looks fantastic though! Hopefully the engine issue is just a sensor problem and easily fixed. I'm sure you've had that smoking issue before right?
Hope it's nothing too bad! Also great music choices this episode!
Very clean build, I’d say the white on the wheels are a bit out of place but if you make then the blue or orange it would be nice. Hope it’s not a massive issue with the McLaren. But Keep it up!
The kit, the colour and wheels 🔥🔥 Hope you dont have to take the engine apart 😅🙈
Looks out of this world!
Insane!!!
I love all your videos, I watch them all. And all your cars are mega including this car. But I’m sorry to say it, those wheels are absolutely awful 😮
Color and wheels look amazing!
What an awesome job you’ve done on this. The colour is stunning and the carbon even better!! Sorry hate the wheels! But can’t fault this channel ❤❤
The Wheels fucked up the BUILD. Facts
beauty
Unique...definately unique...hope the motor sorts...👍👍
I love everything but the carbon front is just a big no. It disrupts the flow of the car so much... please.
Those rims do NOT go
Loving this, i hope Richard Hammond replies back to you, all hard work gone into it
@Mat Armstrong: @18:03 Already noticed it in your Porsche video but forgot to comment: The German word for bonnet is "Motorhaube". The German word "Decke" means both "blanket" and "ceiling". I suppose the Porsche engineers were just referring to the top/bottom or rather up/down alignment of the car parts with a weird wording like "Decke"/"Boden" as in ceiling. Not as literal blanket covering the engine. ;)
Now just needs 1200hp and a parachute
I know maybe u can’t do it bcz well. It’s more effort and time wasting 😂 but change the orange stitching seats and dash to the same colour as the car paint
Hummmm.... interesting color choices.... I think I like it!!!!  Very different is why I like it...great job all!
Who else hears Waifu instead of yfood
That color and those wheels look soooo damn fresh on that car very nice build 👌
Paint yes wheels no
Everthing nice but the wheels are not it fr
Blown head gasket??
That car looks great and those wheel are pure sex, well done Matt another great build,
Love the color and wheels nice 😊
Nice car brother Mat. The smoke kinda looks like when coolant mixes with oil in engine and when the fuel is injected with it to push on pistons its turning the oil and coolant mix to smoke lol haha. I dont know anything about engines only what ive watched on youtube so dont take my word for it hahaha😂😂
Dare i say,beautiful car but....i really wish it was painted a dark colour.😮😀🇬🇧🍺
That thing looks phenominal.... 😍
love it
I LOVE THE WHEELS
Tiffany blue
Sorry but the wheels are just wrong for this build, can't always get it right
the merc is my fav
Killing it.  So proud of how far you have come.  Rapidly approaching GOAT status, sir!
Props to video production: that music perfectly matches paint colour choice.
Nice build again but I hate the wheels man... they really don't fit the car.
Rims are crazy kool. The color of the car and carbon just goes great.
Congratulations on the LE YFood🎉 happy banana also suits u by name😊 its so mad to think all u have u have created from day dot through your Happy banana attitude has rubbed off on so many people and made us all Happy bananas through watching u and your amazing Happy banana crew😊 and u have delivered and smashed it once again 👍🚙😊
When I first saw the colour I was like na, but the mix with black made it superb. Do not like the new wheels, looks like an electric car. But who cares you own a f…… Mc Laren. The old wheels were a nice match. But brilliant work, hope nothing serious. Your gt3 in Florida got me to take my hat of for that crazy rpm car. Hi from a danish giy living in Brazil.
What you've achieved with this build is truly amazing however I have to admit I'm not a fan of the colour or the wheels 😩 personally I would have gone with lotus chrome orange with the carbon and black wheels similar to the originals. Just my opinion. Still an awesome looking car Matt 👌
Sorry Matt.....Not a fan of the wheels,....the Colour is Mint tho! 🙂
Why have pirtek not sponsored the videos especially with your dad wearing a hat 🧢
Mat may have done a tavarish 😅
Bit too much carbon on the front for my taste but man does the rear look good
One word, Tron. Well actually, a few more, it’s looks the 💩 🤙🏻
Change wheels 😅 otherwise MINT
Looks like a hot wheels car! 🔥👌🏻 so sick!
Hey mat where Will there be more videos of the Audi
Them wheels 🛞 are totally 💯 pure class 👍👍
Hi matt the mclaren looks awesome,  you have gone all West Coast custom on it. The formula one wheels really sets it off. Again you are in the zone  with this build.
The wheels make the ugly colour look even worse. Any other colour would look better.
I started watching this video it had 300k views by the time I finished it went up to 400+k views. Well done Matt! Very good job! Nice to be on the journey with you!
shame it looks like matt wills' car 😅
Love everything except the white disc on the wheels Mat But a stunning build Hopefully not an engine build! Ricky can certainly advise Good luck I really want to get a 720 too
You should go on a drive with a guy called Matt willz who has a similar car it would be so sick
You could be a deliveroo driver in this. It's the right colour 👌 lol
Looks grouse! Well played 👏👍🍻🎯🇦🇺
That colour is fire 🔥🔥 Not many cars would suit that, but this does 👌
You and your team's progress just makes me  happy for you. Keep it real. Amazing work.!
looks fantastic Matt, The wheels look good but wondering if they would look better if they were colour coded to match the cool paint scheme instead if having the white outer rim...... Did you think about doing that Matt?
Matt is not gonna like the wheels later on himself lol
Absolutely awesome the paintwork and the wheels are stunning the only thing different i would do would match the outer part of the wheels to the paintwork
unsure aabout the carbon with blue colour. it is so sudden... like it doesn't flow well? but hey not my car sooooo :P and the rims... YIKESSS... yeah... naaaahhhhh....
I love super processed foods
Such an impressive job on the rebuild, the carbon fibre kit looks awesome. Wheels, though, are pretty grim IMO, why go with white detail thats literally only on the wheels? The “bad” wheels from unfinished state looked far better 😂
you didn't mute the previous clips :D
I really hate the white rings other then that chefs kiss
Looks mental  Love it👌
10:30 W T F happened lmao
Sorry, but the wheels look terrible with the white trim.
Been worth the wait awesome.
my little hinges in me flat hold up a heavier door :D
Savage Mat
Love your videos greetings from Holland
I think you should change the orange interior to match the blue exterior.
I've been waiting like everyone else for this, wasnt dissapointed.  I drove a 720s around Rockingham the weekend it closed, since then its been my favoirite car. Your version is incredible, keep up the great work and maybe consider painting those wheel halo's the same colour as the car like the Taycan S. 😉
If toothpaste was a car
Car looks amazing but the white on wheels need changing to blue to match the car 💯
Tron! Love it
I didn’t like the paint on the wheels at first but it’s growing on me another awesome build mat
Looks very nice good job mat just not sure about the wheels😅
You might start a new trend. It has the illusion of a whitewall tire when moving
Matt...it's an absolutely BEAUTIFUL color!  The wheels...oh boy...not so much. Greetings from Texas!
I hope Tony’s driving the wheels off his Ferrari the legend 👍
in germany we say MOTORHAUBE
need to make my Audi a3 look this nice (i wish)
How can you destroy such a beautiful car like that
I love your 720s
Cheers mate ! Another cool vid and what a team you got 👏💖👏 living the dream 🙏😁
Those wings kinda ruin it 😬
Head gasket?
Hey Mat, can you do a bmw comp m-sport?
I'm kind of jelly mate , your ambition is pretty narly.  😍 keep pushing 🫸
Issuances don't total a car because it can't be fixed. They total it be cause the labor costs more than the car.
need to make my audi a3 look this nice haha
The wheels are a bit of an eyesore in my opinion but the rest of the car looks class
Thought you'd nurse it a bit first drive.  Full send! Kudos!
Color & wheels are 🤢 ... sorry. Still respect your hard work 👊
I wasn't sure about the paint when you showed the first panel, but as soon as you put the car together, it works, and I think it's quite a good color. The wheels... not so much.
It’s not called deckel😅 the proper name is Motorhaube😅
just the bonnet carbon and The wings in body colour would have looked better imo. love the colour tho and the wheels look nuts
Looks great....the wheels not so much
The light blue & orange theme gives me strong Gulf Racing vibes
It’s a nod back to whitewall tires.🛞  Looks fantastic!
im on the bas 50% those wheels are AWFUL!!!
Some gta v.  Vibess with the wheels
Man the colors are like a clown car. The paint doesn't look well with the interior. Then the rims made it look cheap and cheesy. Bro, you lost us on this one.
thw wheels are :(   the cars is amazing as original
Boss mate , you're best car so far 💯💯😎 love the paint job and wheels
Engine very bad. 😂❤
The color and the body it is mental!!! But thoose Chinese rims are awful and heavy as shit, and don't believe they are build for that car at all.
Hey mate any chance you are able to do a affordable build like a ST or cooper s or somthing ?
Classic McLaren move that.😅
At first, when I saw mint, I thought ‘Hmmm’ Then I saw it against the carbon and thought 👌
Nothing more permanent than a temporary fix that works
That front end looks like a shark. Add shark teeth
That McLaren hydraulic machine is a bit like a blood transfusion machine😂
…Bonet or … or … if you are german or Capó if you speak Spanish lol. Amazing video 👌🏻
Best colour
10:40 there is about 10s of audio overlay here just to let you know. Great video as always 🔥
I dont mind the green...... Gotta colour code the rim outers tho they look poxy white. Course thats later if she's got a gut full of water or oil 😗 She'll be apples mate 😃
18:03 Matt im sorry but nobody ever said "Deckel" it's called a "Motorhaube".
Them wheels have ruined it
Nice. Not on the carbon arch pieces and the white detail on the wheels make them look small. Otherwise, looking good
Love the car, love the colour, the body kit is awesome.   The wheels... I'll be honest, i don't like the rim, kind of reminds me of white tyre walls. Think you should take them off so we can all see the wheel underneath.   But it's your car so as long as you like it then it really doesn't matter what we think.
I like to wheels but the color needs to be changed to match the car.... good job on the 720s
Greetings from  germany. Great job as always. Looking forward to your video every week. By the way yes "Deckel" means lid but bonnet we call "Motorhaube". Here is no engine like in a Porsche then we call it mainly "Fronthaube" I guess.
Wheels should be gloss black , looks pants in white
Love the colour, love the carbon, love the wheels, car looks mega. Fingers crossed the engine is not terminal 🤞🏽
first tavarish mclaren engine goes kabooom , and now Mat's ,,,
Looks mean such a good looking motor! 🔥
I Tavarish has tought us anything it's that these McLarens need a built motor if you wanna tune them. Glass rods.
Love the colour and the wheels !!❤
Colour is awesome .. wheels meh.
Great build but wheels are not looking good.
Congratulations Mat. Color is on fire But I don't like this wheels on the McLaren Best regards from Germany cologne 🙏
Matt it needs roof scoop
Omg 😮 I’m thinking a certain 675lt and the ending 🤞🤞🙈🙈 it ain’t too bad what a vid colour and those wheels 😊
Hood in German is "Haube" :)
Oh no ! I hate breakdowns 😢
Mint!❤
“What are those” 🛞 😵‍💫 The mint green has been a long time favourite colour of mine, but those wheels definitely spoil it for me. It’s your car though, and if you’re happy despite ‘engine very bad’, that’s all that matters. Look forward to you diagnosing and fixing the engine issue. 🫡
leuuveeee the collaaa. Freaking on point. Nice combination with the carbon and the wheels. Amazing!
Absolute class as always love it but the the colour will have to be a grower as it reminds me of the Invacars from the 70’s 😂
“Will replace later”😉
Does look great but personally id paint the front arches body colour with the vents left in carbon
Perfect carbon to colour combo. ❤. One off wheels for a one off car. Needed special wheels to set it off.
engine not good
Keep it you're self
can i have pleeeeease
I love the colour and the wheels too! Keep up the good work team! Hope the engine isn’t too bad but I’m pretty sure Freddy will have bits 😂😂
that carbon is to much
Yo mat don't gaveaway the car bro
You should change the interior color to something different
Love all the colours on the car but now the interior with orange dont match up! Sick car tho!!!!
Matt, you can make it a Gulf racing  McLaren with some extra orange
THE MCLAREN IS GONNA LOOK TWIZTED FCUKING SICK WHEN YOU GET IT ALL DONE.....YOUR POPS IS TRULY A GOOD MAN ALWAYS LAUGHING HAVING A GOOD TIME...LOVE THE VIBES....GOD BLESS YOU GUYS
Nice colour , absolutely awful max power wheels
What colour with the carbon 😍
Wow Matt it looks amazing talk about keeping one in suspense.  Hopefully the engine problem can get quickly sorted and we can see  you on the road with this amazing car.
Mr Mat - car is amazing but I don't like the white wheel surrounds .....makes it look like the Delorean with 50s white wall tyres from the film Back To The Future 3 😊
I love the color and wheels look great
im sorry if I missed summer but where's the rs6 with the bodykit u rebuilt
Editting bad, very bad :))
Great video sick car would you go full  black  with the wheels?
As a german, I just wanna point out that hood is not actually "Deckel" (lid) in german, but "Motorhaube" (engine hood) :)
Looks amazing!! But you won’t be keeping those wheels forever! 😂
Fantastic. 🎉
That colour is just friggin' wicked. Nailed it!
It's mad how much of a garagisti botchjob these McLarens actually are😂. Freddie must be a tad jealous that you finished your McLaren before him btw😜
Wheels are minging, cars looks quality otherwise lol
That looks like it’s the cylinder head gone
I have literally just bought a guitar in that exact colour, absolutely gorgeous.
Some funny audio bits at 10:30 😂
Amazing until the wheels went on makes them look too small but each to their own you have done an incredible job love the colour!
cars are pain ❤ feel for you
Wheels look total shite 😢 and the trims make them look like 15 " wheels
Sorry mat but just not feeling the wheels this time, the original mclaren wheels in black would be my choice
Probably just coolant
Amazing work! Hope the smoke effects are short-lived and a simple fix! Love the colour, works really well with the slightly 'alien' styling of the car, but it does swear a little with the orange on the seats. But those wheels...it was all going so well until those wheels....
Damn, lads he's keeping the Mclaren, I was waiting to buy tickets 😂. Great colour choice and wheels IMO @matarmstongbmx
I was hopin for orange, but this is SOOOO MUCH BETTER!
Love the colour. Many of my cars in Forza are this colour.  Not into the wheels, but its your choice.  Love what ur doing❤
Nahhhhhhh
amazing video again. thanks
Wheels!! Not for me. 👍
Sorry to say so but you ruined a perfectly looking car. The color, bodykit, carbon and rims are not my cup of tea. But it’s your car so you can do with it what you want. Love your video’s by the way 😊
Absolutely stunning build up to the wheels going on, I know the colours minty but those wheels look like a set of 15” Polo mints 😬😬
Or capot in French or motorkap in Dutch😉
Love watching your videos Matt and your positive energy of you, your dad and the guys helping you. This McLaren looks amazing. The color is beautiful. I would choose the original wheels but these look great too. Hopefully you get the engine sorted. Keep up the amazing work and the fun too watch videos. 😊
OMG this is OUTSTANDING!!!
Do you ever do PPF on your cars like this one? Great build
Wheels ruined it😤
Nice job, Matt that car reminds me a car from Tron the movie and the video game.
💚❤i am loving those wheels👌🏾they are crazy unique mat😋
Normally when you see people with money buy expensive things and something goes wrong i think ahwell sucks to be you. When your shit goes bad i feel like i want to sell every thing i own and fly over just to try and help you. I felt gutted seeing that smoke. Hope its not too bad.
The car is really cool, sorry to say the wheels i really don't like them, great video, hope you fix it with little fuss.
Am I the only one who thinks carbon fibre is horrible?
Love it
Somet from gta 😂😂😂
maybe is personal to you but I see a lack of taste here, colour depends but wheels destroyed that car
Mat. They're not wing mirrors ..... they are DOOR MIRRORS 🤣🤣🤣
Love the car but the wheels look odd in my opinion. The surrounds look odd on the off side because the design of the teardrop holes don’t look the same from both sides. The wheels should have been designed near and off sided because of the teardrop design to keep it looking sharp. An oversight maybe?
haal direct die wielen eraf, het zou er nog beter uitzien als ik wielen van krijt eronder zet
Stradman wheels :3
Not gonna lie, don't like the wheels. But the car isn't for me.
My fiance said to tell you well done
Miami Dolphins colors!!
Them wheels look terrible like someone made it on gta 5 🤣
Honestly love the wheels. I just think the white makes it look like white walls. I would paint the white the same as the car. But honestly looks good as it is but think it would look better car color. Cars is bad ass tho congrats
In Germany we say "Motorhaube" and this colour looks mint bro!
Got to say, imo this is the ugliest build to date 😂 still great work as always
Oh wow I believe maclaren charge 5k for a 720 screen fitted according to evil gt!
A shame the wheels are ugly 😢
Sorry....... but the white on the wheels have took the edge off a fantastic build
The German word for bonnet is Motorhaube and not Deckel
I love the color, always the content.   While I'm not a fan of the wheels, it's your car, so if you're happy, I am too. Congrats Mat! 🔥 😆
The secrets out your GAY.
I think you should take the  MCLAREN your dad in the ferrari and your girlfriend in the porsche to Monaco 🇲🇨
Love the light blue colour! Love how the Mclaren turned out. Hope you can get the engine sorted out!
Oh no those wheels are really ugly
Its your thing and i love everything but the wheels……. Not knocking them just idk. Hopefully not to serious issues w/ the fire. Good luck. Nice reminder for me why i wouldn’t wanna undertake a build like this.
Love the wheels man! Like friggin' Polos! 🤣
Mat Broh, I want to Buy the Drink From Bangladesh 😢🇧🇩 Asia
Don’t mind the colour but those wheels are ugly
That looks amazing Matt I agree it’s the best looking car in your collection and for me it’s the nicest 720s iv ever seen the colour is 10/10
This McLaren is fantastic, the wheels, the color, the carbon fiber, everything is awesome. But the smoke is not so good. Let's see what happens the next video.
Love the colour - not convinced on the wheels at all
Engine Very Very Bad . Love the colour combo though, especially the white walls
It's looks like it came out of a tron movie 🎬. Very cool
Mat keep the car
Love the car, not the wheels though, congrats on the rebuild however 👍
You should be proud Mat. Looks great. You have come so far. Want to fix my piece of crap  Dodge Journey?  😅
What an amazing achievement matt love the look of it just not sure about those unique wheels..hope you get the engine sorted
I’ll definitely buy a ticket or two if that’s the next car give away 😂😂👍 keep up the great work lads 💥💥💥
I HATE IT !!!  No, not the car, the fact that it isn't mine. It's the dogs cohoonas Mat. What a fabulous job you and everyone else has done to bring this car back to life. Truly hope that the engine is not damaged.
poa so much↨style on↨this↨car↨master piece bro!!!gg
Not to sure on them wheels tbh . The rest of it is sick
It is just me or the rims look like whitewall tyres 😕? , great color tho and the carbón kit it's literally on fire!
Just my opinion.....   Superb efforts to rebuild the car. Looks fantastic BUT the wheels kill it.
In Germany we don’t say: "Deckel"   We say: "Motorhaube" 🤓
I like the car in general and the paint.  However please paint the wings and the bonnet leaving it just carbon looks like it's totally unfinished.  I love the Rims but the rim rings white look off to me you should paint those the body color to blend them in right
The wheels are shit
sick weels !! fkg nice!
Those wheels are absolutely gash 😅 shame the rest looks really good
Matching gloves to the body!
How bout you chop up the old tub in little squares and sell 'em
I don’t like modern cars, but this one looks fantastic. The wheels looks like something made in the future to emulate white walls tires and that colour is great
28:20 epic wheels. LOOOOve it!!!!
ignore the negative comments. it's your car and you can paint it however you want. p.s that side view at the end is fantastic - i think the white rims were a good choice otherwise the wheels would blend in too much.
Bonnet means "Motorhaube" (which translates to "engine hood")  in German, not "Deckel". They wrote "Deckel" on the Porsche, because there is no engine underneath it but a trunk and a trunk lid is a "Kofferraumdeckel" in German. That is where the word "Deckel" comes from.
Great job boys excellent 👍 as for the the colour and wheels……. Sorry but it’s a no, cheapens the car in my eyes. But it’s yours and so as long as you love it, that’s all that matters. very very well done boys. Can’t wait to see what mayhem you bring to the next project. Have you considered electrifying something????
Everything awesome, until the new Wheels came on. They look ugly as f*ck....
Love the colour, but those wheels are atrocious 😭. But then of course it ain't mine so as long as you like them 💀😂
Hey Mat, you are so smart and crazy man for rebuilding car from scratch, I hope that see you one day and talk to you about cars
I'd make the front bumper carbon too. That would look so sick. Full carbon front end.  Not quite in love with the diffuser yet either. Bit too savage maybe.
Love the colour but I must be the only person in the world who doesn’t like the raw carbon look
Imagine white accents instead of orange in the interior. It will match with the wheels and it goes better with the mint color in my opinion
Paint those carbon bits it looks odd but keep the vent carbon and panel’s body colour
Matt’s dad working on cars whilst wearing a Rolex 👏🏼
That color is bangin
The wheels are cool, but it does look like a polo mint
Car looks amazing if you just put some six silver wheels on it. Wow this car will be wow
Wheels look like little whitewalls 🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
miami dolpohins colors are raw af!!! im from miami so im biased
That colour and wheels😑... poor Bruce.
Definitely burning oil and a lot of it !!!!
That’s one ugly car
Too much carbon is so out. Horrible look.
21:48 it’s British we always find a way around every thing
Looks sick honestly 🙌🏻
Car looks mental, gutted about the engine, but at least we get more videos on the Maclaren fingers crossed it's nothing terminal
Paint and carbon looks slick, but you have proper shat the bed with those wheels mate 💩 hopefully it’s not engine very very bad, good luck!
Nah
I was wondering what if i bought a wrecked Audi R8 and gave it to him to repair it for me with a cost of course would he do it ? I’m not an old subscriber and idk if he said something about this…. Never mind keep it up mate!!!
Wheels are Terrible but the rest is bad ass
Love your work Mat, although you are being generous with a 50/50 opinion on the rims!
Colour is sweet! Best colour you’ve chosen on any of your cars! Good job Mat!
With the new wheels and colour it looks like something out of the movie Tron, amazing build Matt
Great achievement Matt!
Love the build, colour, kit👌 wheels a big no
private road, with double yellows LOL ;-) all good wahey
This 100% looks like a car that i would have built 7 years ago on GTA before cruising around in Los Santos 😜
Maybe one day Matt can learn how to wear a hat...😂😂
Looks like it’s crashed through Halfords
The wheels👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻🤦🏼‍♂️🤯
The build came all this way to cut out on the private road at wheel mania
I don’t get the rims if he paints the white part the color of the car or if they can make that piece and carbon it would look better
Car looks amazing  Wheels ruin it soz just my opinion
Absolutely Mint 😮👌🏼
Bodywork is ace. Wheels er no. Sorry.
I don’t want to be annoying but the better word for hood in German would be „Motorhaube“ great video!
Loving  the colours and it look very nice go on mat and can't wait for the bmw👍👌
Yeah right, the good old German "Deckel" 😂
Coooool
Isn't it normal for a McLaren to catch fire? You did nothing wrong.. 😂😂
Love the colour but personally not fan of the orange with the mint
u are gonna hate the white on the wheels in time Matthew. Brake dust is a bitch.. highperformance brakedust is worse even.. i had white compomotives brother.. i know.
The combination of colour and those wheels with white side reminds me the old American cars running in the 1920-1940s. Very particular. I like it. That smoke doesn't look oil this time, but..an another adventure for an another day. Cheers from Italy.
Car looks good but wheels are terrible! Not my taste but your car! I like to watch your channel!
CAN I GET A LIKE BRO😂😂😂😂
Mat I’m loving how you did the color are you going to paint the wings, fenders,  ?you know but bro the rims looks like something you’d put on a pick up truck 🛻
That look like a from TRON movie😎
The colour makes me think of a 540c for some reason, still like it though
I hope it's not a serious engine very bad lol
Love this Channel! Mat seems so down to Earth and humble! He could find EVERY reason to be arrogant but is the complete opposite! He seems like an average friend that you could just hang out and do car stuff with. Don't change and keep going with the Awesome builds!
That was an ending not even Netflix could have scripted...
You should have the wheel rings painted the mint color cuz the white or silver doesn't fit with the carbon, black and mint colors
The wheels look sick why are so many people hating on them
It looks awful.
Love the look , but ya as you said the wheels are personal. To me it looks like gta 5 when you put muscle wheels on a supercar 😂 hope the engine is alright man that was alot of smoke 😢
I'd of done the wheels in the same mint colour as the car
Music is weird in this one
HAHAHAHA
I don’t like the colour or the carbon or the wheels. That’s just my opinion so no hate at all! I can fully appreciate how mad this build has been! It’s deffo the biggest build you’ve done and probably the most complex and it has paid off! It is a MENTAL car!! 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
That Matt is absolutely stunning well done keep up the good work always look foward to your videos 😊
Does Adam know what youve chosen.
Wheels are just 🤮🤮🤮🤮
10.30 in your talking over your self. . Multiple voice overs matt
Yeah noooooo the wheels have to gooooooooooooooooooooo....Hideous
You transform a beautiful car, into the most ugly car....
The smoke i reckon is overfilled.oil. sure the exact same thing happened on vtuned maclaren.Ace colour and the wheels are marmite...but I like them. I'll look out for it in Leicester!
WOW it looks amazing. Love everything you've done and you saying you'll never sell it is the icing on the cake. I hope the motor issue is resolved cheaply for you. Awesome, keep up the great work. LOVE IT
I like the wheels but it would look better if the rings were color matched to the car or carbon
Love the colour but the wings and outer rims need to match,looks a bit odd otherwise. What a build this is next level,hope the smoke isn't to expensive 😳. Keep up the great content 👌
Matt, I didn't like the color at first, but when the wheels were installed, everything fell into place... I think it's now the most beautiful McLaren in the whole world! True!
Sorry for all the smoke and engine very bad.. on the plus side you and the team will have a blast fixing it, cant wait to see.
The car looks sick brother. Do what makes you happy and don't worry about the rest...❤❤❤
The style of the wheel makes them look small
The wings look wrong? Need painting and the carbon louvers left exposed.
Color is super wheels are mediocre   looking, cheap looking with that awful white surround.. But hey it's your car.. Great video as usual 👌
Not keen on the wheels, look like old 1950’s white wall tyres
Not sure about the wheels, but an amazing achievement. A credit to you all.
Mans said sprinkle of carbon but that was a mf nuke! 😂
Sick lookin 👌🏽 🔥
Awesome car, color and carbon kit but the wheels are horrible 😵‍💫
What a stunning car , great finish
Front panels looks hideous. Paint them
Wow!! Looks like the car should be in “ Tron” classic 1982 film!!! As for the wheels, well I’m not sure 👍👍
24:36 Definitely looks menthol!
loveit mate
Great car, not sure on the wheels. Sorry
Awesome!!!
Watching from guyana, love what u do ,keep it up
Colour + Wheels are okay - it's personal taste in the end, so since you like it, then all good. The carbon fenders are not looking good however, and their quality seems to be off.
Thx for the video! Why not using lexan for the upper windows?
So pumped I found your channel bro, mad respect from Australia 🇦🇺 ❤
i love this, holy smokes (no engine very bad pun intended)
White wheel bits to cool mint as well would look great!
I was just saying how Matt has the best taste in wheels and then he puts those hideous things on 😂if the white part was black I guess they wouldn’t be that bad everything else is sick great job Matt keep them coming ❤
Ngl not a fan of the new color i feel like from far away in the sun i will just look like white
Or Deckel if you german😂
Anyone else noticed something wrong with wheels? 🧐
Perfect build 👌 couldn’t have done it better myself!
Hey, matt, how about the mint color in the interior remove the orange and make it mint color.
Original wheels were better... much better.  Great job, beautifull car (if you putt back old wheels 🙂) The failure at the end of video is something we all are getting used to, so no biggy 😛
Paint the silver on the wheels mint it will look mint 😅
Great vid as usual. Sorry bud not liking the wheels they look like white wall tyres!!!!
Amazing what you have done with this car Matt! Hats off! However, I have to tell you. The wheels are teeerrrible!
It looks like a salamander to me, why don't you call it Sally? I think it suits it perfectly
Same wheels as Stradmans carbon Lambo except White trim...?
bros building cars like his building PCs🤣
Wheels ruined it car and kit looks lush but them wheels defo mess up the loo it it 😢
loving the content mat keep it up ❤
The colour & carbon unreal great job
Ahhhh don’t like the wheels but the build is brilliant
Turbo seal
MAT?
The car set on fire in protest to those wheels you just put on it, it was screaming "WHY".
I like the wheels. Something original with good taste.
Tron Wheels 👍
in germany we call it "Motorhaube"
Awesome built. Although I do not like the wheels. Due to those rings they look too small.
I like it 👍
That colour is superb on that car. Another class rebuild
Rims are sick ❤
hood or bonnet in german is not „Deckel“ it is „Motorhaube“ (like Enginehood) 😂 hope this finds you.
CAN'T WAIT FOR THE FULL REBUILT VIDEO,.......I binge them
Mat, the car looks brilliant. It is totally reminiscent of a "Tron" car in my book. Well done - unique, unusual and still awesome! Engine oil related woes? I hope you guys will find it's a really easy fix!
Looks like it has 10 inch wheels and whitewall tyres :D
The car looks amazing. I'm getting Tron vibes.
More brit and American and Japanese cars old new whatever be great
wasnt sure about the wheels before you put them on. on the car they look next level though.
Lovely car ….. wheels … not so much …. Sorry matt
Too nice of a car to have possibly the worst looking wheels in history
Definitely my favourite video
Man it looks ABSOLUTELY MENTAL 10/10 on the whole color scheme up to the rims
Oh also yer need to get yer misses more involved today's women are getting more involved in motersports and more an more female petrol heads today it be cool
@MatArmstrongbmx the car looks amazing. My daughter and I love watching the show, and she hopes we win the brake disc so I can make a wall clock for her bedroom. We are looking forward to trying out your limited edition yfood and hopefully winning the brake disc. My daughter aged 10 thinks your dad's laugh is so funny. Keep up the Amazing videos.  James and Olivia
I bought the y food really like it. Not sure I used your code but did you see the link from 2nd chanel.
Wheels are dope. Straight TRON baby.
Looks like something from the future, only wish it was my future, great work, hope the engine isn’t “Very Bad?!?” ! 😂👍👍
Thank goodness this is a 1 of 1. The wheels look like beadlock rims. Guess money can't buy taste..👎
5:45 I will find you
Rod out the block 🤔🤣🤣🤣 hope it's not! Car looks sick!!! Get a set of mint trims for the rims as well Matt 👌👌
Am I the only one who hears "Waifu" everytime Mat says yfood in his app read? I'm not sure I want a special limited edition Matt Armstrong Waifu
What were you thinking? I'm so disappointed in the result. You made it look like a Tron Light Cycle. 😬👎🏻
Great colour but might just need more time on those white bits on the wheels 😂 personal to you though 😂
White Wall tires like your grand dad had
Love it all, a bit shocked at the wheels tbh 🤓🙋🏻‍♂️
The white ring on the wheels doesn't go with the black and sky blue colors of the body, if they too were black or sky blue, they would look great.
Wow the colour looks amazing
Hmmmm... Not sure I'm a fan of the front wheelarches, I think they break up the side profile of the car too much. Nevertheless, impressive work!
Rims ruin it
Great video loved it, not convinced with side view, seems to make back wheels look small. View from front quarter is epic and looks fabulous. So yes I do don't like the look🤔
It came exceptional. Love the color combination ! Mental! You achive you’re point! Unique! Good job man! Keep it up. !! 🙏
Oh the car is awesome an still yer dad top dude  soz but rims mehhhhh
Wow m8, smashin it👌
Color is perfect. I’d paint the fenders and probably the hood as well, but looks good the way it is as well :)
Everything you do is brilliant matt love these videos
i love it
Aww love Tony “our subscribers want to see a video”. Such dedication to the viewers. Love this series on the 720S and all those before too. I wonder what is next in line after the McLaren? Matt, and crew keep it up.
The colour and carbon kit is 👌🏻 but i think even you know them wheels are a bit tacky 😂
Love the colour Love the kit Hate the wheels
Car looks stunning but the wheels are a mistake for me they spoil the build but thats just my personal taste
Colour is horrible but each to their own.
That colour is mint ❤🔥  Loving the new wheels 🔥
Great Build, hate the wheels 😂
I remember having micro machines that were that colour.
Looks so good!
From how you got it to how it looks now its mental I think it looks awesome the mint green with the carbon and gloss black really set each other off really well .spot on pick for the colour .I wouldn't normally like that style of wheel but it works well I think far play to you mat keep it up carnt wait to see what was causing the smoke at the end good look with it mat and looking forward to seeing more of your builds
Polo mint wheels?
Looks amazing, but gutted for you at the end
Put the old wheels back on - please!
7:13 EACH? - nice editing catching the well appropriate reaction - watched it a couple of times lol.
It´s usually not Deckel in german, it´s Motorhaube. Deckel is more like a pot lid or  bottlecap.
LOOOVE the color! The wheels look so small tho with the white rings.. :P
Wheels are terrible!
What a build,thank you🔥
U need light's in the shop to show her real beauty ❤
Glad you like the colour. Controversy sells. Wheels are another choice statement. More interested in whats up with the engine. Best of luck mate.
I'm willing to bet the white smoke will be an o2 sensor or there's too much oil, iirc there's no dipstick so you're reliant on the car telling you.  Possibly a cracked intercooler as well, either way good luck. Not mad on the wheels, but it's your car so whatever.
It’s Motorhaube in Gaerman although that would be translated into engine cover which in this case does not make sense…
Amazing 😍...well done on another super super build ..looks beautiful and best of all you made it personally for yourself...let the haters hate hate hate 😂😊🎉🎉❤
I wish someone would tell them its not a trailer and its a recovery truck ffs
Freddy hates you so much right now... LOL Those Wheels are SICK! The car is OFF THE CHAIN!
This car looks so perfect. *cough* *cough* but the kit and colour look spectacular.
Amazing work Mat. Keep it up!
God build matt 💪🏾
Really nice colour but those wheels🤮🤮🤮
"one of the only cars you can get painted without taking the actual car" ~Smart ForTwo has entered the room~
Cool sorted vid I reckon the fire was your dodgy brake lights matty so don't go blaming yer dad 😂
Ferrari F40 when?? But seriously good job
You have destroyed this car with them wheels😢😢😢
Is it now time to inform Hammond that it will be finished for Christmas.... 2024; I don't remember you mentioning a year 😂😂
hehe, I love this content and the way you do it and all the content, I'm waiting for the next episode❤❤, I hope everything will be fine with the engine😀😀😀
You should make it fully black or fully carbon with those white rims it would look incredible
The wheels with the mint colour look pretty neat, but the orange is kinda awful🫤. But it's your car...
Wheels are dead 😢
Please tell me that the vents on the front wheels are real and you cut holes in the whell arch covers for the air to move out of thw arch
Looks wicked mate, just not a big fan of the wheels this time.
It’s more Motorhaube as Deckel
Is good that the car did that because you may not know what was going to happen next 😢😢😢,So servicing time,By McLaren. And congratulations by the way 🎉❤
I love the build and the wheels BUT it can look better, I think if there was white paint on the car matching the wheels, like the roof should be white, or add white decals then this McLaren would be perfect, minus the engine lol
Yeah... nice 😊
First i wasn´t shure about the colour even Teal being my favorit but with those smashing "neo-whitewall tires" ... absolutly stunning 10/10 🥇
Matt i must say this has to be the best 1 yet enjoy the vids
I think the wheels make it looks like it has 1950 white wall tires  surely you could have went another route  sorry
If it were mine I would have to paint the side of the Wings body color I would leave the tops Raw but I just couldn't handle the break in the body color between the bumper and the doors
Wow that colour looks amazing together with those wheels just 10/10
Ripping it when it’s stone cold. I guess it didn’t like it. Lol
Who don’t like a 2 time rebuild
so Matt what the hell went bang mate? Smoke lots engine very bad
Hope it's not a serious issue, Looks Amazing though! love your work :) watch every video! I was building r32 gtr's in Leicestershire and my personal one got stolen without insurance so gave up with them And the UK to be honest super sad not to be in the car scene anymore so watching your videos really helps   A pair of nike air max 1 elephants would suit the car ;)
The car came out amazing Matt. At first I thought the wheels were going to be or have orange in them but the white looks good to. Well done.
The car look so good. The only thing I would change is the grey bits around the wheels to be papaya spark orange to fit with the interior and create extra spark
Honestly I think Noble had better build quality than McLaren which is on par with TVR
Loving the old man's Pirtek hat. Really reminds me of the guys I used to work with when I used to be a maintenance tech on the trains
the car 👍...the wheels 👎
That is the sweetest 720s in the world!!! Congrats!!
You drive hard with cold engine right?🤣
Wow! The wings need to be body color, and the wheels are a no-go. And then the engine went kablamo!
Awesome video.. Hope the engine is an easy fix.. But with all that smoke, unfortunately I doubt it.  But nothing you guys can't fix! The car looks freaking amazing but those wheels.. Meh.. The outer white rim, makes them look small for the car, and imo the white doesn't match the color scheme
Those wheels ruined it.
Matt the car looks unreal best car in the collection 🔥
Are the wheels the same as the ones on the stradmans carbon fibre aventador ?
Belting that love it 💙
May be a blown head gasket 😬
Those wheels 🤢
THE WHEELS 🛞 NAH WHAT THE COLOUR AMAZING
Great channel, great content.. prefer this to TV 😂👌 Keep up the good work lads 👍
I wasn’t on board with the carbon kit at first but it turned out ok, but yes those wheels just ruin it, sorry.
The wheels are definitely not my cup of tea, but glad you got it the way you like it!
Matt ABSOLUTELY AWESOME BUILD BUDDY LOOKS MEAN A PROPER WEAPON. JUST BOUGHT THE YFOOD TOO .WELL DONE THUMBS UP FROM US HERE AT U8V ALTRINCHAM
So in german ita not deckel, its Motorhaube. Deckel means lid
The white feels like a throwback to white wall wheels. Love it!
Awesum built bro ❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wish I had a dad still to do this from now on he's my new dad on YouTube
Colours sick! But they wheels 🤢 each their own I suppose.
EWWWW!! - WHEELS 😫
I love what you have done with this Mclaren
That McLaren is the definition of “marmite” some people will love it some will hate it but I think it looks sick 👌
love the car.Just not a fan of the front arches not painted,would be cool with them painted but partly still carbon
Wheels destroy the car sadly
Truly looks incredible 🤩 To me it looks like the car version of the TRON bike. Hope the engines okay 🙏
In German it’s not Deckel it’s Motorhaube
I don't know what will be more annoying. Fixing that engine or cleaning those new wheels !
Matt not sure what mistake bro but I'm a 43 year old men from Tennessee and the way u treat your parents and the hard work beats talent, bro there are some kids from Tennessee The Goon squad don't know if u have heard of them but I promise tour family should meet there family same people different side of the pond ....😅💥💥💥💥💥keeep up the god work homie or should i say Bloke💥🤣🤣🤣🥰🥰🤣I just know yall seem like great people and I respect 🙏 the he'll out of yalll 🤘
Love the build and the colour , carbon looks sic but the wheels I’m not to sure the white surround ain’t doing it for me
Someone show the old geeza how to look in the camera
its not Deckel in German its Motorhaube wich translates to engine hood
I challenge anyone to find a minty fresh McLaren mintier fresh than this one in all its minty freshness 🎉❤
18:03 😭we don't call it deckel 🤣🤣. It's called a "Motorhaube", a deckel is on top of a bottle or jar. It's the thought that counts I guess 🤣.
That colour though! 😍😍😍
Paint match the wheels lip
Bro I’ve been watching u for 2 years know and it’s crazy how your budget for videos is increase. Keep up the good content 🤘🤘
Matt u have truly awful taste, but your work and channel are awesome ! X
Quality vids the last few cars. Will you be doing a nice everyday car soon? Rolls Royce will do🫣😂 or maybe an over the top off roader!
The best McLaren imo and in my favourite colour! MENTAL!!
I was loving it until the wheels were shown, would have to loose that white trim.
Love the final look too. Epic!! 🙌
Lost me on the wheels :(
or german instad of hood or deckel, motorhuabe
😢😢 what a beauty
It’s not Deckel in german which would mean „lid“ it is „Haube“ xD
Been waiting for the next episode on this :) I can go into my next week of work now lol
First
the back of that mclaren look like a bloody monster
Gaaaad this car is siick fuuuuuuck
LEVELLED. UP.  🔥🔥🔥
The wheels look classic Americana white-walls.
Awesome vid....me as Australian is always defending my Brit heritage...most people around the world think we drink tea with a finger poked out and all stuck up no sense of humour....I beg to differ....these boys are having a blast and laughter all the way....I do suffer some depression...I always get a chuckle watching no matter how shit I feel. What a beautiful car...nice work. I don't believe I will ever own a super car but I guess nor did Matt back in the day.
Tavarish can probably help you get sorted with the engine if its toast. be cool to see him come to your shop since you've been to his a few times
The color grew on me during the video but I’m not so sure about those wheels 😅
That`s stunning!
The wheels are the worst part. OMG they are soooo ugly
Those wheels are hideous and not keen on the colour either but great build
Put a 1016 front bumper on
Wheels are gay 😂
The color combo plus the carbon fiber bits were just fire!!! The wheels 🧐still not so sure.
really cool build but i would get the white parts of the wheels color matched
Looks really nice 👌🏼
300 quid for a hinge and my cars worth about the same
The wheels are very cool, as never ever seen any like them.
This is water steam, not smoke! Its burning water. Maybe head gasket?
Perfect color! Love it🤓
The colour reminds me of Cal look Beetles of the 70s and 80s.. and also Harrow Council vans of the same era 😂 I think me, or my boss, sprayed a Ferrari 400i in something like this colour back around about ‘83 😅 looks great, looks mint 😀
The wheels are like thestradmans carbon lambo
You looked like a kid in a candy store wiping the excess bonding off 'em side skirts.. even more excited than the Lamborghini Gallardo. Keep this one for yourself Matt, it's the one!
Dam thats a sick build.. 👏👏
i loooooove your channel!♥
Love the wheels. They look very similar to the stradman wheels on his Lamborghini aventador widebody. Car is awesome dude!
Them wheels are hideous
Toothpaste. Why?
My daughter's Fiat 500 is the same color (lattementa) 😂
You need to build a car with Christian Von Koeniggsegg
It's the new MacLeans minty fresh McLaren!! (also available in herbal variety!)
Im a German, and I don't know what deko means in German the Bonnet  is Motorhaube
Wheels suck but if you remove the white ring they may be cool
Personally I’d color match the white on the rims to the same minty green
That car won’t see a new hinge 😂😂😂
The wheels totally messed the car up IMO
Love the car, change the wheels
That's a looker
lol engine very bad love that saying, bodywork I like with carbon but don’t like the rims   Look oddly out place
😎😎😎
10:30 time onwards check your sound on the video seems to be two voices. yew sick car
Unfortunately the wheels are a 👎🏻 them gloss black ones looked fine 🤷🏻‍♂️
The wheels goes well with the rest of the color.
10:33+ you got some problems with audio Mat! Cheers
Hey guys, what a journey. Love it absolutely love it but, wheels should have been all Black though IMO. Keep em coming 😍👍
Matt love the colour .. but shot me mate wheels are fukc ing dreadful..liked everything you have done so far but not them
Actually digging the wheels! Much more than that atrocious diffuser 😆
I nearly shed a tear when it caught fire 😢. Really hope it's not massive issue after all the work you've all put in bless ya's.
They are the exact same wheels that strad has on his carbon Aventador 😅 so not one of a kind I guess
Loved following this build love the colour. Hate the carbon sides where the louvres would go and the wheels 🤦‍♂️ 🤷‍♂️😆 maybe it’s a grower not a shower. Good job never the less carbon really sets it off.
Wow! Honestly, when all the carbon bits went on I was disappointed... BUT then those wheels went on and it all came together!!
This is a compliment by the way with the colour choice and shape of this car it reminds my of a sleek poison dart frog super quick and stylish
She’s truly mint my friend 🤌🏼
British layland suspension!!!!
When you said "That looks mental!" I thought, "That looks menthol!"
Paint colour and carbon amazing, wheels not my cup of tea. But what a car.
I love everything about the car except the white ring around the tires but it may grow on me - should paint them minty lol
In German it´s not "Deckel" but "Motorhaube" ;-) ...btw: There are several cars that can drive without panels e.g. BMW Z1
Another epic build mat love the colour & the kit but not those wheels 😷😭 fingers crossed you change them in the future 🤞
congrats, great job
That color is sick!! Love it and the wheels also. Good job!! Hope everything turns out fine with the engine
Well done mate, g'day from Australia 🇦🇺👍
Loved the build,but sorry i cant stand the colour or the wheels,only my opinion, as long as you love it ,thats all that matters!!
The wheels trashed the look of the car, but it's yours so that makes it unique. I personally think you were high on Y-food with the decision on your wheels, considering everything else you did to the car is mad sick!!
Hmmm  Public restroom green.
Hey Matt! Paint the aero discs in the same mint color as the car!!
I actually like the style you've applied tp the car, Mat. Personal choices, otherwise you're never going to enjoy something somebody else chooses, plus, you're keeping it. Enjoy it, smokey McEngine aside.
Can see u changing the wheels soon but what a job best build of the lot
that color is awesome truly on of a kind great job. ps hope the engine is ok
The rubbers make the car more aerodynamic
Body shop: What colour do you want your Mclaren sir?  Mat: Mint chocolate 🎉
Issa no on the wheels, everything else is a yes!!
That wheels are sick!! But i would have got all black. Still, the 720 and the 765 are gorgeous cars. When i see one im stunned with how this cars look. What a built!!!! Epic👌🔥
Love this build but seriously let down with those wheels man they are horribley horrendous 🤢🤮
i dont like it
The side skirts will pull off at speed. Bolt them on.
You should have done the wheels the same colour as the car ! To many colours kill the colours ! The car is mad but the menthol blue, the orange and black interior and the white wheels is too much
The teardrop white bit of the wheel looks good on one side but the other side looks wrong because the teardrop goes the wrong way.
People love opening their mouths about someone else’s car that they could never have when they are  whippin a cruze with an Amazon wing and autozone vents with a plasti dip hood on stock ride height and wheels. Like shhhhh lil bro it’s not your car
Yeah them wheels look awful 😢 the car looked better before 😂
Those wheels suck mate they just don't look right also that bonnet is cool but the carbon wing tops nah!
Big bomboclaat wish it´s not blown
I think those white bits in the wheels would have looked crazy in the same mint colour
It sounded like you said "We have our own bottle of Waifu." Lol
Wow  What a beautiful wheels ❤
Love the colour, I’d probably paint most if not all the carbon wings though, just looks a bit broken up side on, wheels are not to my taste either, but that’s what makes these cars yours, they are unique.  Keep up the great content
I think the front bumper should be carbon fibre too
i love the car soooo much, but i think if u change the white on the rims to carbon it would look sooo good
My very first New car was that same color.
Mats dad is the only guy on YouTube who has no idea how to look at the camera...
Actually Hood  is called "Motorhaube" in German
0:05
What’s a colour ❤❤ amazing choice
The colour of the car makes no sense compared to the interior
i like it looks mint like a gta 5 modded car love it
The car color is gorgeous and love the carbon. The white rings should be carbon or the wheels should be white to match. Still love it!
It was all hinging on the hinge😂
Could be a fuel issue, maybe?  Wrong octane?   😆
Love the colour scheme hopefully U don't have to pull the motor out 😅
I quite like the wheels but they do look a bit 70,s white walls 😂😂
pontiac fiero is another car you can take all panels off and drive it as well
Idk about the rims they seem kinda off to me  I think black or chrome would of been better but it’ll probably grow on me over time
Wheels are ugly but this rebuild was epic. Congrats! 🎉
Love the videos Mat, but good god the car looks awful. Carbon and mint coloured car is bleeding terrible.
Been looking forward to this for ages
Those wheels are fire 🔥
The rear fitment is a tad weak 😢
Hey, german guy here! We call it ‚Motorhaube‘, not ‚Deckel‘ 😎😂 love the grind and the videos, keep it up mate 🤝🏼🫶🏻
Its "Motorhaube" not "deckel" but yeah
Freddie has a lot to answer for - you’ve caught ExplodyMclarenitis off him!! Hope it’s not too serious! Love the colour, wheels are not for me but awesome build as always Mat
As a Dutch person, you say 'spatborden' for fender and 'bonnet' for motorkap.😁
You might find the rubber trim isn’t the hide panel gaps… but to keep wind noise out around the door.. when your doing nearly 200 mph
If they don't like the rims you choose they can always build their own McLaren
Deep purple with carbon should have been....That just looks like a huge chewed pack of wriggles gum
Looks amazing well done u must be pretty proud 👍
Wheels 😩
Looks stunning! Congrats Mat!
18:02 German here... We call it  "Haube" or "Motorhaube" not "Deckel". We put Deckels on bins 😁
Everything is perfect, except the wheels IMO.
Hmm not so keen on the colour combo. Too much of a clash for my taste. Each to there own tho
Your verdict on the diffuser didn’t sound too convincing and I think we can all agree it threw everything off.
Looks great --- except for the wheels .
Those wheels!   Super cool!
The colour is flipping awful!
It’s not „Deckel“ in German. It’s „Motorhaube“ 😂
The wheels are not mirrored?   Colour is cool. Carbon is (like often with your builds) too much and too in your face.  The idea of the wheels is cool, but not done right (and they are too small - but you know that).   Cheers
Truly one of a kind except Matt Willsz near identical 720s😂
Mint green. Just wrong. Sorry mate.
She's looking gorgeous, I love that double colour scheme ❤
In Germany we don't call the hood "Deckel", rather we call it Motorhaube, which roughly translates to engine hood, since a lot of German words are really descriptive. Deckel ist like for jars and buckets.
awesome ❤
out of question, if you rebuilt a Hyundai I10, would you put as much carbon on that as you did this mclaren? 🤣🤣
i love the Mint McLaren but the Wheels..... sorry SHIT !!!
Do those white plates come off them wheels? Would look much better without them.
Bro is Ls Customs
Sponsored by Polo ?
Love the paint job but the wheels are a bit iffy
To work on cutting edge technology you need to be a cutting edge engineer.  I am sorry but most of these cars break down or catch on fire.  Just saying.
Looked like steam rather than smoke
Lol....honestly Hammond it's fine😅
The original alloys looked so good with car ! The new ones aren't the worst but originals so much better with the kit
Please don't raffle it off please keep it 🙏🙌
Would love to see a custom interior to match the body colour, embroidery with MA on seats. Make it 1 of 1  your very own mansory
Audio error ! 😞just so happens to be my middle name 😂 Stuff happens   Car looks mint 🤔😊  I got a feeling it’s going to be a engine out situation 😞STUFF HAPPENS   nice content
Next video Matt does an LS swap on a McLaren 😊
Do you like 10 pin bowling... think you based a car on a bowling shoe 😂 does look awesome tho...
In Germany we say "Motorhaube" to it. It means it is the hood of the engine. Even wen teher is no engine in the front.
Great colour choice for the car. I would matched the wheels white part with the same mint colour
Los Santos customs ain't got nothing on Mat and the team 😊
Great video the car looks really nice but I think the wheels ruin it
18:02 It's actually "Haube" in German ;)
Sorry colour no wheels no
Your dad might remember this  you modelled the McLaren on the colour of a 1970s invacar classic
I never heard an Hood be called a Deckel. It’s called Motorhaube
I’m obsessed with the colour, aside from the Leyton House Acquamarine blue, this is the best colour I’ve ever seen. However, the black/carbon bits are way too large. I mean the roof is perfect, the trims/splitter/ diffuser too, but the bonnet, the wings and the rear wing should be mint too. 😍
Amazing video. I remember seeing this at gravity on the trailer. What a build! What a colour! Wheels 🤔
Mint 🤮🤮 sorry bud but just no!
Love the colour
Brilliant channel and content
The colour and body kit are awesome but those wheels hurt my eyes! 😂 Look like something off an EV.
FRESH !
NAH...SIGNATURE PROJEST !@!!...100 PERCENT ...SPACE SHIP NEXT ELON MUSk LEVEL.....😂
Furious German noises: It's not "Deckel", it's "Motorhaube"!!
Bro it looks so awesome. The color is perfect with all the carbon and those wheels just pulls it all together. Awesome build as all your builds. Keep up the hard work. Its an inspiration to me to watch your videos.
this car is furious. absolutely sick. rims go perfect with the body.
Mat you forgot about physics after such a side impact What do you think happened to the piston group in the engine?
Mat, lose the wheels 🤦
well i am german and a bonnet dosent mean deckel in german we say MOTORHAUBE
I think what you've done is amazing. The colour choices aren't mine - but neither is the car :D I'm gutted for you that it's got a problem.   But it does make another interesting video for us :)   I never say anything good about my car, ever. Someone asked me how it was going today and I just said "I don't say anything good about it, because I don't want to jinx it".   Really gutted for you, but I'm looking forward to finding out what the problem is.   Smoke comes from a blown head gasket, but that comes out all the time. Yours seems to come out mainly when you rev the engine - I'm guessing that fuel isn't being burnt. But I don't know fak awl :D  Hmmm large flame, then damage............too much of an explosion in the cylinder? Too much fuel/air? Injector not working properly? Timing???  You didn't touch the engine, but could the impact have done something to it?
Whole build look nice especially with those wheels
Headgasket is bad my friend 🥲
Nice white walls
As much as i like allot of your other designs and decisions on colours, I found this really horrendous. the colour does not match the power of the car. and the interiour and brake calibars just dont go togheter with with the babybleu and the tires. Love the video ! keep up the nice content.
be cool to see you do a classic car
Mat I love you. And your content. But the colour and the wheels. No no no
Anyone else thought ‘horrible colour’, then ‘horrible wheels’ but then realised when it all came together that is actually really really nice! The fella is a genius. Hope the engine/fire isn’t all that bad.
I like everything apart from the wheels. I like the wheel design. I'm just not sure on the white.
It turned out nice, the wheels are too much of your preference. I guess you never finish building a car, especially on YouTube😅😅. What is the name of the song at the end of the video?
No issue with the wheels but they should of been body match them rather then the white
And here was I thinking Tavarish P1 looked awesome, he has some serious competition here, that is just stunning
your dad is a legend and you matt
NAILED IT! work of art.
Color match the wheels
The build was fantastic. Although kind of odd, the carbon looks amazing. But it doesn't seem like the outside wheel trim is mirrored. The wheels rotate in different directions, but the trim is the same on all four wheels.
Man I wish those rims were mirrored... Looking at it left side on, the outter holes rotate the "wrong" way.
I am not normally a critic, but those wheels have spoilt and amazing looking car, the white band make them look small. Love everything else you have done, but in my opinion they need to be changed, something black gloss or carbon, you just have two many colours and they look like they belong on an electric car.
So the color. Would never ever thought that color for any car. Oh wait, that color is now my whole personality and i will repaint everything.
Those wheels are Brad Pitt 💩
So what about the back light ? Were you right ?
Them halos on the rims need colour matching to mint
The telephone call went like this "Hi Ricky.....it's Matt......i have a problem.....any ideas?"
Great job! Never forget the fire extinguisher 🧯 after finishing builds.
not sure why white on the wheels.... other than the smoke from the engine... nothing is white on the car....
Dont call it a Deckel ever again... I dont know why Porsche had it on the cylinders but the correct terms are: Motorhaube or Haube. I guess you could say Deckel if you are beeing funny about it but the right term is Motorhaube or Haube.
Awesome as ever Matt. I think you need a 'Engine Very BAD'  hoodie in the merch...
What a brilliant build this is! 🙌
Need to sell that to a Florida rap artist 😉
Happy days 🌟🌟🌟🌟
WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU TAKE ON A WRECKED KOENIGSEGG,,,FINGERS CROSSED U GET ONE
WOW----> 110% better than the original BatMobile......
Blowing the Mc Laren engine on the first run. Please Matt, be original instead of copying Freddy ! 😂
New bucket list item. See one of these builds first hand😊
I weirdly like the colourway, the car itself is insane !
Those wheels are the ugliest ones i have ever seen.
color combo looks pretty good....except the wheels....sorry mat....i would have kept the originals.
McLaren look differently beautiful
Nope on the wheels.
Okay, so about those wheels. I think you need to match the seats to the wheels. Lose that orange stripe and get the same colour as the white on the wheels and that will finish it off. Of course this is only my opinion.
What a unique color 👌👌
Full carbon would go crazy tho
Hood is Motorhaube in german
Points for the original wheels. Shame they are not handed 😞
The mirror was the first prototype for the apple airpod 🤯 great build 💪
the carbon fibre hood makes it so ugly xD
A masterpice!
See even the engine refused to run with those wheels 😅.
Man i have to give you this one... You have a great taste i like the combination it's lit 👌
Imagine if the white on the wheels was also minty fresh 🤔
Wheels are mental!!! So so good!!! Car has come out absolutely amazing Matt!!!
Car is stunning apart from the wheels. Ruined it🥺
Wheels at first glance are a statement. But when on the car with the colour give it that retro look white walled tyres. Very nice 👍🏾
LOVE IT AND YOU SHOULD BE REALLY PROUD COS THIS WASNT A REBUILD IT WAS A RESCUE OF A SUPER CAR THAT PROBABLY NOBODY WOULD OF TOUCHED COS OF THE AMOUNT OF WORK IT ENTAILED,,MY HATS OFF TO U ALL,,,BRAVO
Paint looks good body looks good but the wheels Jesus Christ 🙃 i think thats why the car broke it dosent want them 🤣
I love the colour and the carbon bits. I love the wheels too but think maybe there needs to be some white touches added to the car for the “turbo fins” on the wheels to tie in. Looking good though. I hope the engine issues are too big an issue 😊
Body kits are a No No on any Car but well done guys.
I belive that car was so sad with that ugly wheels that it burn it self.
Mat you should make a video on the BMW E24
The rims circles should match the colour of the car in my opinion. Nice car, let's hope the engine failure isn't that bad.
OK I was with you until the wheels.  That white ring either needs to go or be painted the mint green to match the body.  Sorry Matt.
10:40 editor?
A „hood“ is not called „deckel“ in German
What a machine. Colour is 👌👌
Dear Matt, we waited months for this reconstruction..... It was 90% beautiful, but I can't understand those white rims, it didn't match, sorry... it clashed with the set... But it's your taste, be happy
“Deckel” is the german word for lid not for Hood 😂  Next time say Kofferraumdeckel 😉
GERMANY HERE 🇩🇪 : what kind of German word is a „deko“ ? Doesn’t mean hood in German 🙈
If the car is made in Britain, why does it need an import inspection?
Hood is "Motorhaube" in german😅
Looks like a flash green /atacama tribute to the volvo v70r, take a look mat its insane.
its not called Deckel in German it's called  ( Motorhaube ) or just Haube.
bro is a legend
Paint the white part of your wheels with mint blie like the car and it will transform as it should.
Love the colour but paint the fenders and rims (white part) mint as well. And add a roof scoop.
"Deckel" isn't the right word for the bonnet 😅. It is 'Motorhaube. Deckel is used for a small piece, like a bottle cap or a tank cap (Tankdeckel). Bets wishes from Germany
Don’t forget PPF on carbon part .that will get  scratch on future
Hey I don’t Like aktuell the white ring of the wheels but whiteout them they were nice and I think that at the end the Turbos were destroyed. I love your videos
Matt Armstrong love work DIY Supercars. What you it take for you to find a Challenger Wide Body Hellcat??
Llados lo pinto de ese color
"No issues, what so ever", except for maybe a blown turbo....
Best looking McLaren 💯💯💯
The paint color grew on me quickly then the extra touches...🔥
Sorry but those wheels are a mistake..
I would call it "Motorhaube"not "Deckel" in German
Paint the white orange!!
It does look hideous. 😂
The wheels ruined it
Just to let you know ! I love the colour but it doesn’t match with orange, not at all…. You cant be good at everything 😊
Can't wait to see this at the next drive tribe event 😉
You copied  stradmans wheels
horrible wheels mat come on!!!!
Turbo seals maybe? That looks like oil being dumped into a hot exhaust turbine housing.
LIMO TINT IS 5% IN THE US thats not dark hahaha
wicked car mat. its certainly fresh content!
The color is so unique and looks good with all the black and carbon...the contrast is nice. The wheel style is okay but those covers...the color is terrible is absolutely clashes with the rest of the theme on the car. They need to be carbon, black or maybe color matched to the paint to tie in everything.  Definitely do not leave them like that!
Looks great love the colour think it needs the wings painted though to tie it all together hope the engine is a quick fix good luck
Seeing the colour for the first time on a panel: nah, not my cup of tea. But, wait until Mat did his magic. Seeing the total car with colour and alloy’s/ rims, for the first time off all Mat’s cars: a no no no for me! But what a job and hey, as long as Mat is happy about it! 💪
This built reminds me of one of the amazon dart frog. Great built.
That rear diffuser is SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK
Time to do a DDE and rebuild the engine and make it 1400hp
Super spearmint cool with the Polo wheels ...love the car.
In German the hood of a car isn't called Deckel (Deckel means lid), it is called Motorhaube which translates to engine cover.
The car is looking amazing, straight out of Forza💥
looks amazing pal well done
MAT!! READ THIS! ITS ABOUT THE CARBON ROOF! OK I hope that got your attention, there is a wrap YouTuber called 'CK Wraps' American youtuber but he just done a video on this new Carbon Wrap, it looks exactly like the real thing! Go look! And maybe get some to match the rest of the Carbon on the 720, trust me you will want some!!
As always an awesome video and the 720 looks incredible with the colour and body kit.   My personal preference would have been black wheels to complement the black detail of the body, but to each his own.  Keep up the good work and all the best with the engine repair.
I'm afraid that maybe coolant said hello to the pistons😬. The car looks amazing everything is so perfect. Loved it and those wheels are awesome ❤
This looks familiar 🤔😂
With the color and wheels the car looks straight from GTA V lol.
holy shit! moonlight sonata! fucking awesome choice, best music so far 👍👍
Love this Matt the colour is amazing not so sure on the wheels but am sure they will grow on me lol 😂 looks epic hope you resolve the issue with the engine.
I would definitely paint the white rings on the rims in body colour, I think it would look even sicker.
Deffo took inspiration from Stradman’s Rohana wheels on his carbon aventador, sick though man!!
Don’t like the colour, don’t like the wheels😄 but I love this utube channel,👍👍
Best channel on YouTube. Same can’t be said for those wheels though. Can’t wait for the update video on the engine.
You should deal with the Huayra mirror ... just gorgeous!!
Mate keep that car! It’s sick!
Get rid of those wheels matt. They look horrible 😕
Triggers broom if you have to replace the engine.
man those wheels are not it lol hope the engine is okay btw another broken mclaren lol call freddy
loving the finish just cant get my head round those wheels
Thanks again another awesome video hope the engine is good. Keep up the good work guys 👍
Truly amazing rebuild and an absolute pleasure to watch, hope you get that engine sorted.
McLaren:  builds a car.   Matt: takes the car apart, and builds the car.   Tavish (aka Tavbitch):  says he will repair one but never finishes it.  Matt FTW.
MATT YOUR A DON IN THIS LANE.....MCLAREN GONNA BE PISSED THEY AINT GOT THE VISION LIKE YOU....BIG UP BRO......BIG TINGS.......
The colour and wheels ain't for me buddy,but it's feck all to do with me. Still a belting vid pal.
Looks like it’s from the film TRON  FROM 1982 proper sick !!
Yeah you were right about the wheels must say they don't fit that car much 😅
I just love the Colour, it is sick.
THE WHEELS WOULD LOOK MEGA IF THE OUTERS WERE COLOUR MATCHED AND I THINK YOU SHOULD DO EXPOSED CARBON ON THE VENTS OF THE FENDERS AND BONNET AND THE REST COLOUR MATCHED KEEP IT SUBTLE.  APPOLOGIES FOR THE SHOUTING DIDNT REALISE CAPS WERE ON TILL AFTER😄
great build,,, wheels, = not for me....
Busted a tavarish lol
Fabulous looking car, well done Matt……. Until you fitted those tacky wheels, they are just like the   local lads put them on their £500 corsa’s.
Sorry Matt, those wheels do not suit the McLaren at all. It was looking amazing until you put them on.🤢
Any chance of making some window stickers ive bought a "brand new second hand" air ride system for my car and would love a sticker saying the words on my tank with MA next to it ❤
Yo mat , I love the McLaren and think it looks insane, there’s just one thing missing, I recon it needs a carbon roof intake/scoop to Finnish the look 🥵
Mat just pulled out a Tavarish move right here
matts dad is mad hilarious
Hood on German is Motorhaube (engine hood), not decko or whatever you said 😂
I don't understand why all the youtubers keep buying those nasty McLarens ...they're piece of over priced crap cars. I have a buddy that is a staff member at the Vegas Raceway/rent to drive an exotic business....he says that McLarens are the hands down winners of most days down in shops for engine and not as much trans problems. Matt, you should've had the engine redone first before trying to go over 50 MPH....the con rods are made out of aluminum foil.... I personally don't like that body style because its oversized and over priced Lotus Elise...puke! I'm so glad this Lotus, I mean McLaren build is done and over....
Usually hate Sundays due to starting another working week but as soon as I see that mats uploaded I’m instantly happy again 🤣
I love that colour with the carbon wheels not sure yet well done mat
Class
Great video 👍the white bits on wheels should be in the body colour
Great video and Mclaren lives up to it's shit reputation, that's why your Porsche's are your best cars you own.
Sick Build, Sick Car - The wheels don’t compliment the colour or the aggressive add-on’s. But just my opinion!
Name of the songs  or beats you played
Hate wafood en YouTube reclame
The Wheels looks like Tron or some scifi, it fits!
what can ya say WOW,thats a one off
The rims are horrible
Triggers brush
Amazing car and color. Why not 21 and 22 inch wheels and a wider rear wheel?
Car looks amazing,  sure you'll get the engine sorted. UPGRADE !!!!
Great video, so impressed how you bring your cars back to life!
Your'e getting 130K views per hour. You're like the Mr. Beast of stupid people crashing expensive cars. The bigger the loss of money the more views. I think its time for you to start an insurance company. 😂
nice  the new wheels look like thestradman's  pink aventador roadster wheels
Mat "does a Tavarish" in his Mclaren....
I still can’t believe how far you have come. I remeber watching your bmx videos years back
I love the color its sick!! The rims are great if you take the lip off makes it look like an electric car rim up close. I liked it at first but seeing the pattern under the lip thats sick. Then the last pic far away makes me like them as you see the deep dish of the wheel. 🧐 Can we get a pic with the lips off?
Oh thats such a shame after all the hardworking you all did! I hope its not as serious as it looks!
Absolutely epic build and video. Great job!
White smoke = oil.
The MA McLaren sponsored by Polo, the mint with the hole?
Right boys and girls 266000 views 30000👍 everyone hit the 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 as this is probably the best video on YouTube
Wow what a piece of engineering and a work of art you have created  love the car hope the engines OK 😬
That colour is perfect 👌
Probably look better with body color paint on wheels instead of white
Should paint the fenders but leave the vents in exposed carbon  And those wheels...
Banging colour scheme
This car should be on gumball 3000 this year.
it totally runs perfect 💀🔥 btw I love the color
Love it but Matt those Corsa vxr alloys OH DEAR that was a stunning build till then please remove them???.
Love it
The wheels are horrendous 😂 What a build though 👏🏼
I can’t even build my ikea malm chest with instructions while Mat’s doing such things…
Best build yet 💪
Sorry mat but the rims doesn’t do nothing for this car 😢
Aesthetically, the break in the colour over the front wheels is a little jarring. Otherwise, the colour does well (not sure the orange interior flashes goes though). It's a solid nope on the wheels, preferred the original ones.
anyone know why youtubers always call a specialist for the windshields/glass on rebuilds? it always seemed simple enough to replace to me
Mclaren inspired by this color scheme
Tiffany & Co called they want their McLaren back 💎😍
For the amount of money McClaren charges you would think the build quality would be much better.  Ill stick to Porsche moving forward.
That is a beautiful motor!!!! Best one yet! 🤜🏻🤛🏻
Am I the only one who is getting Tron bike vibes with this car it looks awesome 👌🏻👍🏻👍🏻
It would look better if the "rim's" of the wheels were the orange of the interior.
The spec is OEM+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Mat Gulf livery - beautiful. Looks like a Formula 1 car, but road legal.
McLaren it´s like a Fiat always broken
Not sure about the wheels and carbon. On the whole a good job though👍
a designer from the 21st century who loves the 50s, that's how you can summarize color and rims, nice I think, continue with more cool builds
Car looks great but sorry Mat... These wheels are just awful... Wheels are big but these white things on made them look so tiny 😅  But combination of mint colour and carbon is just perfect.
So nice to see a nice colour and not matt black  Car looks the bollocks in that colour with all the carbon 👌
Car looks great minus those wheels killed it for me
In German its not ‚Deckel‘ its ‚Motorhaube‘ or just ‚Haube‘. Awesome Video as alwasy Mat ❤
Краще б жовтого кольору. З карбоном би пушка була
Awesome build but hate to say it Wheels look awful... OEM Mclaren were way better
Love it mate!!
I have to be honest… the white on the wheels look crap, ruins the whole look, sorry.
Hola Mat  presioso projecto pero para mi particularmente si m permites la llantas negras quedan mejor es mi persepcion un saludo hermano
Class D was fixed being fixed is wild he actually only used the engine and some wires and some intact internal parts, for normal people this will never go in the options plan for a rebuild.
10:32 is it just me?
looks sick but if i had done it, i would have painted the front fenders aswell
Simllar to Alex Choi's wheels , not common place but different is the way to goto stand out.
Love the colour, not sure about the wheels? Makes the car look like a jar of sweets..
18:03 its called Motorhaube
You lied to Louis Hamilton😂😂
Wheels 😩
I think your engine needs a makeover ship it to Tavarish to get it done 😜👌
Low oil temp and hitting the limiter will do that to an engine like that in no time
That colour is perfect.
Not feeling the 🛞 wheels, the inner colour looks great but the white trims look cheap, and have the effect of making the wheels look smaller than they are.  Car looks amazing though.
nothing screams quality and precision as plastic spacers for panels :D
I don't think the engine's gone wrong... @Tavarish ain't it normal for mclarens to smoke after being rebuilt??
Lovely car, awful wheel choice
Mat and his Crew Probaly did Better Fitment/ Panel gaps than the Factory😂
Mat, you’re better than click bait thumbnails…if we wanted that we would look at DDE thumbnails!  Other than that, great video as always sir
Wheels are a copy of DDE 720s and definitely paint the front wings and leave the carbon vents
Can't believe it!! Gutted for you man but elated at the same time! It's nothing you can't sort out I'm sure, but WOW it looks unique, what a beast.
You need to paint those carbon fenders
It looks great!!!
wheels..... nope, looks like some 60's white wall. carbon kit is the business..
Hahahaha looks awful
You know when you are winning YouTube with such a good view to sub ratio.
Feels like you kinda went off of some cues of the Speedtail and I absolutely love it. Great work!
What a choice of wheels 👌.  Need a update on engine soon as you know
18:04 in german the hood is called Motor"haube" and the tailgate is called Heck"klappe", so no Deckel found here, but nice try xd
Great job Mat, the color and the carbon kit is awesome .. but the wheels looks strange..
I’m surprised how much I like that color on that car, but those wheels are a travesty. They look like they are from a hot wheels car. 😅
Another vote to paint the wings but leave the vents exposed.
its not "Deckel", its "Motorhaube"!!! 😅😅😅😅😅😅
The car looks great but the wheels…..ummmm   lol   I dont have to like it
Should paint the fenders and leave the vent area carbon. It looks funny with the color seperation
Awful wheels, like a 1950s american gangster film car, a definite no from me.
safe to say 1 of the ugliests 720's on the road.
18:12 Nein nicht Deckel Motorhaube 😅😅😅
I am watching this video and about half way through ive read the title of the video... dread and panic watching the last 10 or so minutes with 8 minutes to go I'm stressed.
Engine very bad😢
Really nice but the wheels and carbone tub, full fresh mint with more classic sport wheels would have looked beter to me. Good luck for fixing the engine !
@9:48 you need a proper torch with MAP gas not butane.
A preposterous car! But a solid build as always! Congrats Matt and Team!!
Ur dad is a gud guy🤩😃
Lovely colour with the carbon, not keen on the orange thou 😊 another great job thou 😁
Love the colour and body kit, but the white on the wheels makes them look small. I'm sure it looks better in person though... if it's not a pile of ash 😅
Great video guys!!
Looks amazing, it's definitely one of a kind, I'm bit unsure with the front and wheels, but great content hope the engine is ok
We can’t get Yfood in the USA
I love this channel.. love the relationship you have with your dad.. keep up the good work mate 💪👊
the car looks like BlueBeetle <3
Yet another great video Mat. I love the build. The chap who fitted your wheels, fitted mine last week. Thank you for the great videos. Ive been here 12 months and without doubt, you’re so much better than tv.
Oh my. The wheels look so bad with the white together with the blue mint. Why Mat? Whyyyy? 😮
Personally I would have preferred If the white wheel part was body coloured. Beautiful car though
Thank God for YouTube Money! Go and “Tavarish” the engine!
maybe something stupid i gonna say, but does that smoke have something to do with coolant? or your radiator?
Well done Mat Tony and the crew looks amazing
It was going great until the wheels went on, hard pass they look like the old white sidewall pimp cars from the hood. Beautiful car otherwise
looks like crap sorry
Oh no..,, engine very bad 😭 impatient to see him fixing this issue! Hopefully not a big deal🫠
Car looks great! Wheels are ugly not gonna lie...
wow those wheels look just like mine on the RS6!  Awesome selection Matt! @rr3euro
Jm imports has a solution for the gorilla glass
Car is sick bro You should paint the white ring on the wheels mint to match the car
Glad you like it, but the multi-colors and white-wall looking wheels are not for me.  Great job though for your dream
Matt you fuckin legend. This looks absolutely insane and the carbon works so well.   Them wheels are absolutely ruining it tho man and what a shame about the engine issue😭
Well you should call freddy for that engine replacement 🤣
The wheels look completely wrong for such a nice car.
absolutely love the colour!
I cant remember if it was DDE or Tavarish but I think someone had a similar issue. If I remember right if the oil (or coolant I cant remember) on a McLaren is overfilled the exhaust will smoke like that but after running awhile would clear up. Not sure if thats the problem or what but I hope its not too bad of a fix!
I think it'll look loads better with the stock wings, painted. The carbon is quite nice, but having carbon panels next to painted ones screams old series on a council estate. Plus, those fake louvres are a bit confused and out of place on a car where everything else is functional
Mat, if you are planning on taking it for an IVA test, note the noise limit is 98db!
Wouldn’t be a McLaren without fire 🔥 looks great love the colour but the wings really need painting. Keep up the great work
Everything is perfect except the wheels
Looks mint! Reminds me of a tron car
please paint the fenders but leave a bit of carbon exposed
When you change a hydraulic line on any other machine,like a tractor or a forklift truck, the system generally self bleeds yet somehow a Formula 1 based engineering company is unable to make that work 🤦🏻‍♂️ The wheels are, imo absolutely awful 😞 they look like they belong on a Matchbox car.
Car does look mad. Love that colour choice with the Carbon and that kit looks the poodles privates. I’m not an immediate fan of the wheels, but I guess no one has put white walls on a McLaren before now. The wheels might grow on me. 😂  That exhaust sound is perfect too  👌🏻
Sorry Matt team. The carbon on the front is to much it looks like a car with mismatched panels 😮😮carbon less is more 👍
In Germany hood is called Motorhaube or just Haube 🙂 Best regards to Britain and Mat´s Team!!
Great workmanship keep it up
What a great color! 😍 I love it!
Sorry the wheels are awful
the color and wheels are not doing the car any favours , but then again , i dont particularly like the mclaren design from the start . good luck with the engine
The wheels scream Ken Block and completely change the rear arches of the car. Approved!
Color is so sikk. Nice choice 👌🏼
Wheels is a negative….looks like white wall tyres…..to be honest wheels spoils the entire build…..
This has never happened before... and again, VAG put it in the mouth.
As Virgo I'm astonished by the color you pick for her
You always make me smile.
Mate the car looks amazing love the colour it reminds me of my old Mongoose bmx back in the early 90’s , wasn’t sure on the white on the wheels but the more I look at it the better it gets 🤙🏼 hope the engine isn’t to bad
wheels look the same ones as the Strathmans lambo
500 cals per drink not bad, id only need to drink 8 of them to get my 4000 calories per day lol
Good lord those wheels are attrocious.
Love it, damn - don’t hate the wheel, the white makes it look smaller though, lol - maybe the white needs to be a darker colour but the design is mad
Respekt 👍Grüße aus Deutschland
Only my humble opinion, but I would partially paint some of the Carbon bonnet as it looks to me unfinished 🤷
Looks good!
Why does this always happen to mat 😭🤣
Absolutely love the white wheels, and mint colour. It has like a 80s sci fi / synth wave thing going on.
Dude is using bonding for panels thare are under constant stress from airflow, lol.
I wanna hate those wheels but I really don’t. Cars looking sweet!
White wheel rings spoil it imo
Love these fucking guys... Great color choice and the rims dope as fuck. nice work guys!!!!!
Engine system fault called McLaren 😊
The wheels looks sick👌👌👌
Doesnt look like a mclaren anymore, really stunning
the white works so well with the headlights, im not a fan of mclarens but i must admit i am in love
Bro made the Bugatti mclaren
The rims color are so bad 👎
I hope the engine issue isn’t costly. The colour is a brave choice but looks amazing. Personally I would colour match the white wheel inserts.
Mat did a Tavarish
Hhhmm 🧐 …..Those wheels!! 🤷🏻‍♂️🙈
Unreal looking car .......................except for the wheels 🙂
I loved every minute of it, does take me away from the everyday shit.... keep it up!
idk why but idk slap on some orange color or tangerine trim or seomething but thats me
God, looks like a car from TRON! Probably the best looking car out of all your builds in my opinion 👌🏻
You have mad good taste, another banger. Well done!
Hii
That’s a Hot Wheels design Car, If you bought one new you could never get the spec you have done to your Design and an open mind says 💥    You smashed it Mat
Wheels are horrendous
The stradman had those same wheels on his Lamborghini
That colour scheme looks like it’s out of the 1980s film Tron…   Really enjoyed this one. Can’t wait o watch the 5 hour combined build video when you get round to it.. 😂😂
Diffusor looks awful 🤢 It is better in stock
I love Matt’s dad more each episode 😂💙
What about the FIRE? Eemmmm 😮
Unsubscribed - Tired of the click bait titles and false promises. Yawn..
Looks well Mat and gang
27:20 - ROMANIAN !!!
The car is looking good. My personal choice is that the fender too much carbon looks better on body color.
What’s it look like without the white bits in the wheels?
Those wheels 🤢 it looks like it is on the way to the dealer with wheel protectors on it from the factory. Everything else looks mint!
Great job Mat,  Torn about the colour and wheels, although colour definately looks better with the carbon. Pretty amazing acheivement to have done what you and the team have done. Great work!! Hopefully it's nothing too serious with the engine.
Geeez when i saw the title of the video and the clip at the beginning i thought I would be watching a bonfire! Looks like the engine needs a bit more fettling though. Perhaps the cold and then warmth created some condensation??
Nice car , wheels horrible but each to there own
14:48 to all that dont know yfood : yfood is very good.... trust me try it
Drives on a towtruck with no issues ! ☺
WTF
15:00 Right now, as you are talking about your limited edition MAT Armstrong YFOOD Drink, I have 3 crates of them Already in my fridge!! 👍👍
Would look very nice with the top side of rhe rear wing painted along with the front end and just leave the vents in carbon.
Song name at 12.20 and 12.40??
deko is german? hell no! hahaha Its MOTORHAUBE
Oil over filled , ! Great looking car but the white on the wheels should be carbon 😊
The Wheels, with the exterior color... I Approve!!
Maybe do the white on the wheels the same colour as the paint
😀 thumbnail looks like a transformer 😂
Please come to your senses and get rid of carbon bonnet and wings, also the wheels are just mehh. I get you want it to look different but it’s just to much going on can’t fully appreciate the beauty
The wheels are doing it
Nicest wheels I think I’ve ever seen. Never seen any like them before but maybe better on a black or darker colour car.
My god that looks ugly
Lovely colour, should paint the rims with sae colour
Respect man, you crushing it every single time. Keep it up.  Love the colour, the wheels however, I have to be honest, you went full on stradman on them and they just don’t suit the 720, looks terrible. This is my opinion of course and everybody has their opinion. Cheers!
I love the colour and the CT kit, my only thoughts around the wheels is that because of the outer surround, it almost makes them look too small for the car. I hope whatever is wrong with the engine is a simple fix as after all this work to have a knackered engine would be heartbreaking. Great video as always and I look forward to the next update👍🇬🇧
Love all of the builds and your attitude. I will have to see this one in the light of day but not my favorite in the last shot of the video. Probably will grow on me but it’s your car and it makes you happy. Can’t wait to see what is next.
Ridiculous wheels
looks sick in that coular looks like the f1 car in miami
Love this, i'm just down the road form you.. let us know if you're ever free for a cuppa
With those wheels it’s kind of got a Jag XJ220 feel to it. Very different and kind of cool.
Wheels are awful 😢
Nice!! I do think that the white on the wheels needs to match the car colour though 👌🏻
The color and the wheels are really not my cup of tea but other than that the car looks insane
Paint the white wheel trim body color and I guarantee you'll love it even more!
Don't like the rims
The carbon is too much
Them wheels look at little bit jaguar xj220 ish! Nice choice.
Love the channel,  but that's a dogs dinner!
Holy s*** that colour is so so good Mat. Unreal mate. Quality Of These videos are next level!
I know everyone has their own taste I don’t like the mint with the dark carbon darker minty colour a few shades darker would’ve been better but the white rings just don’t go at all. They need to be black to match the roof. Oh yeah and the engine you must fix the engine. Apart from that, awesome 👍😳 Strad man will like it . After a second viewing, I don’t mind it 👍☺️
@MatArmstrongbmx. I personally prefer the route that DDE is taking with their 720, but that is THEIR vision. Your 720 is beautiful, and it is YOUR vision, and what YOU wanted, so MAD RESPECT for that! Even though I prefer the other, yours is NOTHING LESS than an absolute show piece that you envisioned and built to what you wanted. CONGRATS! (P.S. - I think that Alex has a few Gintani flame tuned 720 motors, I would bet he would let you pick one up, if you asked nicely! haha) But seriously, congrats on this awesome build, you totally deserve it!
I don't want to criticize these rims, but these white elements simply make the wheel optically smaller and separate it from the entire body, and that's why the whole thing doesn't seem coherent. Love carbon and the color you chose.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍
The wheels are an awful choice, but each to their own. Well done on the amazing work and progress with the car.
This car is stunning, excellent work by everyone, but I would keep the old wheels, love the videos,
Tiffany colored McClaren!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Super Dope💯
This is a real "fuckboy" speced 720s, i dig it 😎
Totally nicked the look of my Forza Horizon 5 Fleet 😂😂
Nice
Wheels are shocking. Nice carbon rims
i like the wheels infact, i like quirky things. i might have done the wheeltrims orange instead of white maybe, tying it to the interior
The wheels killed the car.  Love the content tho
in germany we dont call the bonnet a "Deckel" we call it "Motorhaube" if you translate Motorhaube to english its engine hood. A "Deckel" in german is more like a lid for a glas of pickled cucumbers of something like this just so u know
It looks 99% perfect only those wheels I know it has to be special for you but this doesn't fit such a car yet I enjoy yours just like all the others videos keep it up 💕💕
what accent does Mat have?  Toob. Air boobles. Boomper
sorry guys but those wheels ,oh my days terrible
It would look fantastic if you painter the white rings on the wheels a matching blue color.  That would top this thing off.
I love that you put custom wheels on your cars instead of stock.
The McLaren looks like it’s from Tron!!
Car looks great,  fantastic colour choice, those wheels spoil it totally , to much bling.
It’s off the wall. It’s beautiful.
Car is awesome, but the wheels, sorry 🤢
Not sure about the two colour rims. one love.
you have to call it "the minty batmobile"
Looks awesome 👍
I like how it's unique, the contrast of mint and carbon is sweet
those white-wall wheels are awesome
One of the sexiest rebuilds I've ever seen! Hats off to you mat! Top job on this one! 👏😍
The only trouble with the colour is its exactly the same as the old 3 wheeler invalid carriages you used to see in the UK in the 60s and 70s.
The wheels are c…
Honestly, the body looks amazing. Those thick white rims make the wheels look tiny, and in my opinion really ruin the overall aggressive look of the car. Hope the engine isn't too bad though!
Bummer about the engine.  I really like the carbon kit and i agree its your car but disappointed in such a car being painted tiffany blue. And the wheels are a meh.  Was really hoping for a paint job like an mso fade either a really nice dark blue, maybe a gold and blk or an orange and blk.  Oh well hope you enjoy it.
Not a fan of the looks if I’m honest. But if I’m honest. Who asked? Secondly good job on the work and project man! H
@dailydrivenexotics Mat with the 720s! Need to take the next step and make it a GTR :D
Oh my god. White walls on a McLaren😢 Are we back to the 50’s. Love the channel.
The paint the wheels everything looks sick. futuristic look.
The colors don't match each other 😶‍🌫️ in my opinion
Love the car, love the build. Those wheels are horrendous. 😂🤙🏻
What an absolute epic build! Hubba Hubba.......
In German bonet means Motorhaube
Looks like a Smurf threw up on the car. Sorry. Like the rims though.
Lover the colour like the carbon let’s not talk about the wheels engine very very bad, let’s just hope it’s only a turbo 🤞
Wheels make it look like a light cycle out of Tron..epic job
Bro I am Suraj from India I have seen all your videos and they are great bur the greatest of the greatest is this McLaren thus look assume this is the killer bro ❤❤but as a subscribe plz plz plz take my name in your future videos plz bro I really like you and your work bro you the best ❤❤
I wish I could say I love the colour and wheels, just wouldn’t be my taste… but love your videos Matt… keep up the great work, you’re an inspiration…👌
If the white wheel rim was mint matching the body, I think it would look better.
MINTYYYYY jimmy broadbent would be proud 🎉
Another splendid video but I have to correct your German translation. A Deckel is not correct. Bonnet, Hood and Fronthaube. Or Frontklappe if you are in the industry. A Deckel is what you put back on you jam jar after you’ve slathered your toast in the morning. Good luck and keep the epic builds coming.
Brilliant
Love your videos, Mat, but the halos on the rims should  be carbon as well👍🏻 Too many colours😉
It's not Deckel in German it's Motorhaube even if ther is no Engine under the Motorhaube
Terrific achievement! The wheels look very elegant: like a super-funk, hi-tech version of those beautiful old white-walled tyres some classic cars used to sport. Btw, at least the breakdown happened conveniently, rather than leaving you waiting for the AA on the hard shoulder of the M6 in -5 below. 😎
Man what a journey I love the colour and carbon parts r jus love look demon but with wheel I slide it but if u love them u love them is just my opinion
Green is my colour but for some reason this don't sit well with me but mite be it need to grow on me 🤔 nice work 👌🏾👌🏾💯
Matt has me making irresponsible decisions buying project cars forgetting I'm not him and I have a full time job 😂. I'm not the only one
Matt, don’t you think you should’ve warmed it up really good before you-give it shit down that private road like you did chances are you shit that motor
I reckon the blue on the car would be nice on the white bits on the alloys it’ll flow perfect
Hey Mat, I think you should put some Mint lines on the Carbon Parts to connect the Front with the rest of the Car somehow visually. The Color is awesome. ❤This is so entertaining!!!😊
The rohanna style wheels shocked me for real. The same design as strad's carbon Aventador i believe yes. The mac looks like a proper spaceship! 🚀🚀 Hopefully the engine damage isn't a major one. Waiting eagerly on the update!!
there's some voice overlap at 10:30
Those wheels will be marmite for sure.
It strangely looks like a jag xj220 with those alloys insane
Panel gaps are actually traumatizing 😂😂
everything else is unreal but those wheels!!!
freaking love a mclaren , great colours
I love the Chanel mat, but now I’m gonna have to unsubscribe due to the state of those wheels.  🤦🏻‍♂️🤣  Spray them black mate.  You can’t leave them white on a mint 720
It was all going so well until those wheels went on and completely ruined it, now looks like it belongs in thunderbirds
Matt your really make a huge statement with this car damn this car look extremely beautiful
Great colour choice but those wheels are vile. Tye ruin the car. They need to be black.  Hope the engine isn't fucked.
legend
This wheels degraded really this car style…
song name at 12.20 and 12.40???
Wheels look awful and you know it mate
great colour choice
I subscribed 🤓🇺🇸👍
You just build a complete car from the ground up :P
Change the wheels back!  They don’t add to the car.
In german its not "Deckel", its "Motorhaube" if the engine is in the front...!😄 "Deckel" discribes every clasp whitch closes any kind of space... for example a bottle, a case, a coffin🤣, a pot or a bowl...!🥰🤪
Matt love your video I always lookout for the notification so I can watch 👌💪🤘🙌
Looks like something out of the film tron! It looks unreal!! 🔥🔥🔥
Not keen on those wheels but you know, it's your car not mine. I like the minty colour though it looks pukka.
Those rims are dreamy.
We call it Haube, not Deckel 🇩🇪
Mad please take those white lips off the rims and put them in color or carbon....
Looks well mint couldnt think of a two brillant colours go together 😍
just love sitting back watching MA antics
The color is amazing.
that blue is beautiful
I must say the McLaren came out insane but the white trim on the wheels  are kinda ruining it 😢
come on Tavarnish. Where you at.
Fantastic entertainment Mat and team! You make me smile on the darkest of days. Keep these videos coming! 😃
Oh no Engine very bad! needs to go on a t shirt lol
a hood in german is not a deckel. its a Motorhaube
Was scrolling through CTcarbon and started this video, went back to the CTcarbon tab and hear you mention discount code 😂😂 Put another piece into the shopping cart and placed the order 😂  The car looks sick btw, love the fresh and quite happy color scheme (matches your energy) Praying to all the car-gods that it runs in no-time.🙏🙏
Great vid 💪🏼 awesome project you've done so well. Wheels... errrr  😭
i just love how mat makes these videos.
Soo. Close 😕😕👍👍👍
I didn't like the color until the wheels went on, and it pulled it all together.
Fantastic job Mat. The Maclaren looks pretty awesome. Gotta admit  Im not feeling your  choice of wherls for that particular vehicle. Kinda looks like a set of  vintage white wall tires you might see on an old Cadillac here in the states. But hey it's car dude. You be you. Congratulations on bringing another amazing car back from the dead. 👻
In germany the hood called "MOTORHAUBE" :D
I wasn’t sure on the wheels at first but on the car. It works. Love the colour. Amazing build.
The diffuser its ugly..  the wheels shouldnt be white try keeping it in the mint color.
Polos as wheels on a minty car. Love 'em!
An i the only one that doesn’t like exposed carbon fibre finishes on a car? And i know it’s ‘1 of 1’ but my god those wheels are catastrophically hideous…..
you ruined it with the wheels
Love the channel.... not a fan of the wheels tho...
Car looks awesome. Re the wheels, doesnt Stradman have the same ones on his carbon Aventador with the plastic bits in pink?
This dude is a legend for rebuilding literal supercars! Even classed as not repairable this dude is just amazing! I will watch you forever Mat!
you thought u could get away without rebuilding the engine😅seriously hope its nothing serious
Hellow mat i think you should go for white tire with black ally wheel⚫
18:02 Bro, Mat, its Haube, Deckel might only fit for the trunk 😁
Should of got the front wings painted but left the louvers exposed would of looked better I think. Still amazing tho
Sorry bro, I knew it was 50/50 but them wheels killed it 😭 please change
Please bring yfood to North America
wish I could like twice or more. A lot of content in this video. Probably took a while to make. I love this channel, 10 out of 10, can't even put it in words, keep it up man.  PS: The german word for the bonnet / hood of the car is Motorhaube :)
I like the wheels thing they look smart they do look small but it’s not a bad look
Damn!! this looks epic, love the paint with the carbon bits. and the wheels epic!!
The black wheels looked better but I do still love these wheels tho and its your vision and you shouldn't change for anyone
Hi Matt great job on the McLaren pal! Your special offer on the Y food drink after I have given you my report on the drinks I purchased on your advice I add please send us one and I will give you my honest opinion, like I did with Y Food and no reply off em, on your banana drink? Coz mine wasn’t that good!  You would have thought they would have given me a refund a shame they weren’t over the road from mi? 😂😂😂
sorry wheels spoil it :(
Toothpaste
Wow that’s incredible!! I love how it turned out🤩. Well done!! Hopefully the engine is not gonna be to bad 😬.
Colours decent
Love the mint, hate the white rings. Overall, love the car.
What happened with the engine ?
may as well have painted it pu55y pink.
Looks absolutely beautiful keep up the good work. With love all the way 🇧🇼
That carbon bonded to the door 🙈 Wouldn’t want to be behind you on a track or the autobahn when that flies off at 100+
Loved watching this one guys, can’t say I like the wheels though the bodywork more than makes up for it 👍👍👍
So it blew massive amounts of smoke and stopped moving. Next scene the car is sitting there and he's saying it's perfect. Did I miss something?
Those wheels do not look great mate
This was definitely a firee 🔥 video mat. literally 😂😅, all love from kenya 🇰🇪 can't wait for a  part 2 of ...
Those wheels make it look electric 👎🏻
Colore fantastico 👏👏👏ma i cechi con la fascia bianca non si possono guardare o li fai verde manta come l’auto o carbon look🤔😜
Excellent work 👏.  This ride looks awesome.
The next car is a car that can fly i think... Mat and hes dad are car doctors, un be lie va ble!
It looks the mutz nutz
Unreal build, although wheels remind me of Will I. Am car on West coast customs , quality content as always 🤙🤙
Absolutely unreal car, and build.
Car is cool, colour is cool, I like the wheels, but they don’t suit this car, they look too small, even though we know they’re not, the design just makes them look that way.
sick build mat! however i think it would look wicked if you painted the outside of the rims mint instead of white, cheers from south africa
I love everything but the wheels. They look like white walls.
Wheel and Body colour scheme?  **** Polo Mint  ****.   Complete with Polo Mint wheels
Car looks incredible,not 100% convinced on wheels,think the white would have looked better with your traditional gold band instead of the white but what do I know 😂
Arrrrr narr
You inspire me so much!
Great wheels
I'm not a fan of the colour or wheels at all, I think it looks dreadful and you have wrecked it 😢, but if you're happy, who cares what I think 👍
Great build Mat, Love the Minty color with black contrast. Sorry but the white on the wheels looks....cr#&  Love the design ...not color!
Sort looks like it has white wall tires but Im kinda here for it 👌🏻
Matt green wheel rims mate to match the body!
Dude, love the channel, but please don’t become an Archie Hamilton and start click baiting your channel is far too good for that K
Matt congratulations for finishing the car. No offense but this might end up on the worst spec Instagram page
Wow
Looks beautiful
it looks mint mat but i thought the original wheels also looked great too but its a good choice really goes well with the colour scheme
I would paint the white part of the Rims in the Car Colour. But love it anyway
amazing rebuild ,it sounds crazy
Awesome transformation Mat, but I'm wondering what's happening with the RS6. Will you continue to work on it??
If you watch this channel and you're not subscribed, what are you even doing???? Sub to the man
@20:26 Please clip this and use for further episodes 😆🤣
The car is off the scale . 😂 but ditch the wheels
That car looks absolutely amazing dude ❤ great job man 💪💯 on another note the end of the video... Not so amazing... Sorry that happened man
Those carbon fiber panels fit perfectly! 🍻🏁
Im not feeling the wheels that much but i love the fact that they are different
the wheels.... no go like rest of the car but wheels mess it up
Maaaaad
Not a fan of the carbon fender wings. Other then that. mega.
Reminds me of a soft mint 😂 great colour choice!
I dont hate those wheels but i dont like them either but if they mean a lot to you then thats all that matters
You should bring this car in DDE HQ  at Honnigan old shop there's a big massive burn out ward
You’re truly taking the piss. That car looks brand new wtf! Help me with my ST 😭
Killed it again 👊🏽💯👌🏽then actually killed it bad engine 😢
i hope engine survived ;D
The white rings are horrible!! Uhhh
The spoiler gave the colour away... You could even say it was a 'Spoiler Spoiler' 🥴
Not a fan of the carbon wings. For me it's either a carbon hood or the carbon wings not both
Nice vid but the wheels on this one ain't for me.
At least it's running
I mean…did you say Christmas of 2023?   Maybe you are just super early 😉🤣
I love your content, but please stop advertising any stuff from Nestle...
I love it. The colour and wheels are amazing. The only thing I would change is,I would have painted the wings and just left the louvres exposed carbon just to highlight the details. But bare in mind that is just my opinion and its not my car and I can't afford a 720s so you paint it how ever you want and keep up the great content and I wish you the greatest success in the world as you deserve it 👏
Matt has made a packet of polo mints😂😂
Matt you are a legend but it looks awful. What colour is my McLaren? Haven’t got one lol
@Matarmstrongbmx has gone full GTA5 Los Santos Customs with this build 🤣! Bravo 👏🏼 it looks insane!
\/ Wheels dislike button
Wheels ruined it 🤦‍♂️
You are right, I'm not a fan of the wheels. Love the rst of it though!
kevin the dog needs a car
imagine if the white on the wheels were the same color as the car. that would look crazy banana
Great build again, fantastic colour and hope the engine issue is not serious.   Got to say though the wheels are ruining it, they just don’t suit it at all.
The stradmen has such wheels 😂😂😂
Bro mis respetos, what a nice car and chanel I've been following you since the start!!! Congrats all the way from Mexico
i have never cryed bc of a car but this is so beutiful
The car is sick but the white on the wheels kinda ruins it they should have been paint matched or carbon
love the car
Amazing job on the McLaren it looks amazing.🤩
on the audio edit mistake i thought my player had opened a duplicate screen hahaha i was ready to run to go watch on the phone can't wait for the Liberty Walk GTR lol
Not a fan of the color scheme (you do you I always say), but absolutely love the build!  Gives me inspiration to go out and work on my McLaren 600LT.  Great job Matt!
In the car meet you did say Dec Christmas 2023 to Richard when he asked when the car will be ready check your video of the Car meet you are late on the Car restoration completion date Mat I know you have missed your challenge deadline for finishing this restoration/rebuild.
those wheels are kinda strange but I really fw them, the white accents fully tie the black and the blue together
Matt that's definitely the most nicest McLaren I've ever seen
These wheels look like stradmans carbon lambo wheels
Amazing to think it started with a TT
That car looks amazing just hope it isn't major
Gold wheels would’ve made it 👌🏼
Built motor incoming?!?!😄
Love everything about the car with exception of the front wings. Should be body coloured imo, but I’m old, so maybe out of touch. Great build though, enjoying it.
Amazing Masterpiece…… And a work of art…… Congratulations….
The wheels look amazing love the custom look!
Oh wow 😂 those wheels are 🐕💩🤣
Oh man the car looks crazy in a great way .I'm thinking the oil is less in the engine tho lol.Thanks Mat great wheels to
Car looks awesome love how you've gone from the 1st audi tt to supermarket one of the only channels I can't wait for the posts well done keep up the brilliant work and hope the downshift wasn't anything to serious
Twin turbo V 12 swap please
That color is trash, the car was fantastic why you ruined like that😢
Mat this needs to be in Sema next year!!!!!
I’ve imported and Iva’d a lot of cars and not saying it will be a problem but all the aftermarket stuff your adding prior to inspection can cause a lot of inspection problems
Wheels- terrible
What's a deco? I am German but this I've never heard of
Love watching your videos Mat! The cars are extreme and it’s what makes the Channel so great, keep up all the hard work.
Good job on the car rebuild.. but booo on the color choice.
“There’s definitely no issues”… the last words before tragedy😂
hi there, amazing video as always. But i just wanted to clarify that in germany, nobody says "deckel" to the bonnet. We call it "Motorhaube" (EngineCover you could say i guess...)  Much love ❤
Getting XJ-220 vibe....
This post is so fresh I can still smell the lacquer drying.
Car looks great , not fussed on the white parts of the wheels
Hats off to you and the team, what a journey. Loved it all.
Sorry but those wheels don't suit it at  all, a big thumbs down!😢 everything  else is stunning❤
No words... Just wow!
We’ve been patiently waiting for you Matt.
The wheel guys probably made 75% margin on those $5k+ wheels and dont even star pattern when installing lol. Ouch
Insane ❤
Not a fan of the white wheels. But the rest of the car is jaw-droppingly luscious
Love the mint green the rims not so much but love what you’re doing with your builds
Your taste in wheels is that of a 12 year old... I thiink the stock wheels looked better, or heck even a set of HRE's.
The best looking car in your collection is the Range Rover! All of these exotics look more like speed boats than automobiles. We need more Kevin, please!
Its not called Deckel btw in Germany we say Motorhaube
Wheels are nice I just don’t like the white ring around them
Nice choice with the wheels
Engine refuses to pull them Fisher Price wheels
Hi mat if youre Reading this pls get The limited edition yfood meal to The eu if you can
The wheels look similar to Stradmans Lambo
That is crazy😍
You’ve come far Matt, love your style, cars, videos, friends, dad, not gonna say wife, but you got the point.
Aw that reminds me of my old Chevy truck it was baby blue but faded from 40 years of weather.
Be pretty cool to see the whole car collection 😉
Mat,u brave brother, wot a cracking build ,dedication in that -5 !🥶🥶👏🏼👏🏼👊👌👍
My qualified guess is, that the car went into suicide mode cus of the color. 😂
Don't like the wheels 😮
Car colour and kit is perfect. Alloys are shite. Nothing else white on the car so looks horrendous 😂
Love the colour, love the carbon but the wheels will be marmite.  For me they look like wheel trims which isn't helped by the two colours, perhaps remove the white? dunno. Excellent build though 🍻
Think the fenders need wrapping and those wheels are dog 😂
Wouldn’t like to list the modifications for the insurance for this one haha
Its called 'Motorhaube' in German...😐
This can't be the end of the journey, I followed this from the start and was gagging to see the end product, what caused the engine fire? I hope there is another video on this
Is it only me or does he always ruin it at the end with ugly rins
You should wrap that tail pipe in the fiberglass wrap to reduce the temp.
Engine very bad….. again
Sick build
the aero rim on those wheels make me feel some type of way 🥵
I started Lmao when Mat said that the name of the flavor of Yfood was HAPPY BANANA... Because that's slang for BONER... 🤣🤣🤣
(UK) Bonnet - (US) Hood - (GER) Motorhaube not Deckel 🤣
In german it's "Motorhaube" not "Deckel" :p
Tip from a German. It’s not called Deckel but Motorhaube
the relationship with his father makes want to cry😭❤
The rims are unique, nice build!
Not sure on the white rims but it may be a grower 😏
Give me a super car
I am not with you on the color combination
The wheels are the exact same ones that stradman has on his carbon adventador. Just black and pink not white.
the car has got to be safe for the roads in the uk  what about the roads
When you think the week couldn´t get better and you get slapped with a 32 minute video from Mat. I´m gonna go sleep a very happy man.
this hurts more than breakup😭😞
Them alloys let it down
Looks futuristic, if that was the look you're going for you nailed it!
This is probably one of the sickest builds on the internet 🎉🙏🏽🙌🏽
I would paint the white on the wheels body color and probably the “wings” and “bonnet” 🇺🇸
Too bad Y-Food doesn’t ship to the US, I would love to try it out
Your dad is living his best life bud. well done
Great vid but am one of the hate colour and wheels camp 🤷‍♂️
I actually liked the two-tone blue spoiler with the new colour. 12:01
The wheels are nice just not them stupid plastic things take them off and the whole car is perfect 👍🏻
These wheels nooo 😂😂😂  Nooo please get it off
I hope you got your money back on that hinge!
Move over Batman!
here we go again. "engine very bad".
Not a fan of the white bit on the wheels to be honest
Sick Car! Im sorry but wheels are Terrible in this one Matt! ❤
Not a fan of the colour but each to their own also it doesn’t match the interior
Insane Video, but the German "Deckel" is called "Motorhaube" :D
Das sieht aus wie als hätte man jemand sportlich angezogen und elegante schuhe ...passt nicht zusammen ..es müssen extreme felgen sein..so passt das irgenwie nicht zusammen 🤔
Looks like something  out of Tron
Badass well done 👏 ❤
that is proper out there compared to most mclarens but my god its sick...looks like something out of tron!
You nailed it well done mate  The Color is great super nice and fits the car not boring super cars color 👍👍👍  greetings from Switzerland
24:37 Sorry Mat, but that looks MINTal!
as much as i love the videos :-D i gotta say the wheels are hideous :-D especially the white, it doesnt mach with anything :-D but still, amazing work and have fun :-d ;)
OMG 🔥🪣 White trim on the wheels looks off to me somehow, but for that - AMAZING!
in germany we dont say deckel we say motorhaube
Looks like it has polo mints for wheels.  Not a fan, but the rest looks awesome.
But I just want to say a Lamborghini  With Nisan forgo wheels  Yeah  Why not
👎🏼
Gutted😢 at first ? Looks like your asking FREDDY about the 1300bhp upgrade 😊
Even tho it took longer than expected it turned out AMAZING
Not a fan at all of those wheels, I think they would look better without the white part.
The german word for hood is actually "Motorhaube" or short "Haube" :D
That smoke happened on Vtuned McClaren. He over filled it with oil
It’s like a LBRT media car
change the white on the rims to the minty fresh colour then it would flow lovely
The wheel look more like strads all carbon aventador pink one
I'm still figuring out the German word for the Hood. It's Motorhaube. Never mind I Love the Videos.
Mate  Matthew here  Love you stuff
oh i have been waiting for this for so long and its finally done! Amazing work!
Best car to date. Love it
Them wheels are filth mat 😅
BTW a hood/ bonnet on a car in Germany is not called „Deckel“ it’s called „Motorhaube“ 😊.
Way better than wrapping a Koenigsegg in pink. Car looks awesome.
I think it would have been a safer option to put it through inspection and then install the body kit.
Can u do a update on it
I'm sorry but that colour is awful 😅😅 ofc it's just my opinion, a mclaren 720s non-owner
Matt is undefeated when it comes  to rebuilds. 720 awesome😊😊😊
Worth the…wait. An Incredible achievement, well done Mat/Dad/Team.👏 As for the alloys, they look dreadful, really not sure what you were thinking there Mat.🫤
Beautiful colour, makes a change from all the dull greys 🔥🥊
I like the styling, however I think the wheel design would look far better with the minty blue instead of white rims.
Beautiful Matt❤️
🔥
I hope the problem with the fire is not a big problem. I hope he is on the road soon.
Epic but those wheels don't look right.
“Runs with no issues what so ever”  *5 Minutes Later* 💥💥💥
This man is living his dream
I wouldn’t have left Copart. I would went in there office and demanded my money back. Unless it was really cheap. They can’t sell would should be b as s
Terrific build Matt.  Love the styling.  With all that smoke you should call it the Marlboro McLaren!
The edit mistake is whatever- it lets you know we are all watching all the way through. The car is awesome. Looks like an ice cream dream machine. Here is to holding out hope it isnt the motor but it is a McLaren and something will have not been calibrated by a mm or aa loose piece of rubbish was in an intake and popped it :/
Thanks for a great video again , unfortunately I am one of those that don’t like the colour or the wheels , definitely a personal preference. As long as you enjoy as it’s your car after all, but what talent to make that all happen, you make it look so easy.
Looks amazing, I really enjoy the videos you make. Great work
Reminds me of tron
Love the way your dad said “our subscribers” when he was saying about bending the door hinge. He’s right we are all here for you mat but it really wouldn’t be the same without your old man! Said it before and I’ll say it again. I love the relationship you’ve got with your dad, I haven’t got that and it’s nice to know there is some proper blokes doing the proper dads proud.
Good job Mat. Not sure about the wheels though, when i saw them in the shop I thought nice. On the car not so sure
i love the colour <3
Those wheels are terrible. Rest of the car looks awesome
Wheels ruined it 😢
Still stresses me out when that wheel mania bloke straight impacts wheel bolts on 🥴
Absolutely brilliant Matt , one of the best channels if not the best on YouTube for this content keep it up mate can’t wait for the next one.
space ship wheeeeeelllsss sooo sick!!!!!
It looks bad ass matt
Love the car, the build and your videos. Wheels not so much.
I take my hat off buddy 🤌
That color just screams kitchen aid.
In Germany we don´t say Deckel. We Say Motorhaube. 🧐
I really think those wheels are fire ~
marmite is good matt thxs bro
colors dont match
aw mate 🤦‍♂️ ....engine very bad!
That car looks stunning!!! Just please remove those white bits off wheels!
Fantastic build but my opinion wrong wheels for that car
looks so great
Should have painted the wheel covers the color of the car
This guy does not miss! Matt, your journey has been nothing short of incredible. Best car YouTuber. Period.
Looks like the wing is different color than the car
Looks absolutely bloody awful!
Not gunna lie everytime you buy a car like this or the Ferrari I think oh god he’s just wasted 50k but you manage to pull it out the bag everytime, the 720s looks mega 👌🏻
Sick colour 👌🏻👌🏻
Those wheels match the smoke perfectly 😎
It looks like it came from the past with those wheels and the color on it and it had to pick a car to adapt into. LOL. Well done Mat.
You most certainly hit the "one of a  kind" mark. Good job!
Looks amazing Matt. Even if the engine has gone, which most likely it has, you can do some episodes showing your skills in beefing up the crank, rods and pistons and tune it to stupid levels. Good luck fella. ...the wheels are new, never seen them before. New is always different and all new ideas take time to get used to 😁👍
" I can't drive it on the road yet, because it's not registered " So what does Matt do ? Takes it out on the road, revs the piss out of it, and blows the engine up. LOL  🤣
Love the overall car- but yeah, if it was mine I’d change back to the other wheels & paint the fender tops body color…. Maybe some darker green accents to compliment the mint… but it’s your car mate. Congrats on getting it done(ish) - the🔥/engine smoke show not withstanding….  Don’t cha just love cars 😋
31:49 I didn't say what christmas 😂
Another brilliant video, keep up the good work 👏
Obsessed with adam LZ at all?
Itd look way better & cleaner wrapped in something like the new "Isle of Man Green" color BMW is offering on the new X5 M .... The McLaren 720 S would look super sick and be only one in that color! That mint color wrap is fairly common here in the U.S. & the white dish part of the wheel is cool, but on the car makes the wheels look really small unfortunately as cool as they are.
The rims looks like the strandman love it❤❤
These wheels are so bad car decided to self-destruct rather than to be seen in public😂
didnt fancy the colour at first but with the carbon and those wheels and the contrast white on them it looks awesome. hope its not a major issue with the engine..... good luck
the wheels look like the ones on Stradmans Aventador. just white not pink
A little bit of funny audio 😅
Well  It could've have been worse but I think the wheels look mint 🌿
Would have looked awesome on the inside to replace the orange with the mint 👌
Hi Mat, Hannah and Dad, great to see you all and the educational videos, love and best wishes to you all x, Tim N.  Durham
those wheels will be changed soon.
Another epic build from the workshop of MA. Wheels look awesome, colour is on point, what’s not to love
The same happened with tavarish when he thought he fixed his Maclaren 675
My dream car, I’ll own one one day
Is he colorblind?
Fantastic job on the car, wheels not my taste, look forward to seeing the RS being sorted
the same thing that happened to Tavarish’s ?
I think the seals between the front fender (wing) is a solution to wind or air infiltration and related noises at higher speeds. So therefor the gaps between them can be larger and less accurate. I wish my car had something like this at any speed around 80+ mph
Mat is trying to compete in style with the Alex Choi's  720s
Wow them wheels are just sexy ❤❤🎉
I like the wheels but I think I’d either match the mint or go carbon as the ring. Otherwise I like it. Hope the motor is ok
Mint Choc Chip
Don’t normally comment but……. It looks terrible… sorry
Oh mate, there's a reason there ain't another that looks like that. Normally I agree with you but the wheels?? Maybe without the white rim.
The wheels look amazing with that body colour, I hope the engines not cattlled
Just looks like it has massive profile tyres
Hey matt im just asking but can u help me get an understanding how u get crashed damaged cars im looking for a toyota GT86 or a camaro but i dont know how and what or just get a engine can u give som explanation how u find cars in your country bc in the Netherlands ther ar no companys that i know of who sell crashed vehicles
You came for 30:34
Love it but those wheels don’t match, if they were black or the mint colour would look much better. It’s got a Porsche Taycan vibe.
the dad is goted
Sorry bro, I'm in the category of those wheels are orrible! Apart from that it looks insane!
It's cool seeing how your dad became such a big part of your channel. Are your parents still together?
Full respect mate problems don't like the colour or the white bit of the wheels  keep up the great work 👍
I love the wheels, but i would have painted the white bits the same as the mint colour
Colour looks great but 2 things are needed the white on the barrel of the wheels dont go with anything if your gonna do white you need to white pin stripe the fenders or some shit to go with it and please paint the wings leave the louvers exposed but the wings just breaks the whole car the paint colour is amazing but the break up in the side profile is horrendous
That rear end is just Savage
Tron car 😮
You want to build a 80s WRC Car.
Car looks amazing,  but……. It tried to burn itself when you put them wheels on.  What does that tell you 🤮 😂😅
I wish the wings were mint blue
Those rims should be orange
Love the car, love the video......but those wheels? Put it to a vote. A doting parent can't spot an ugly baby!
By far the best ever colour way for a car I've ever seen, not a massive fan of them wheel but who cares the car is sensational 🔥 devastating end though 😔
Not a fan of the white bits on the wheel. Each to their own other. Good luck fixing it
Insane car! Looks like it came out of Tron Legacy film!
love the video keep up the good content 😄
What the colour name or code, looks sick ❤
the mint color with carbon and the wheels are so ugly the engine self destructed trying to tell you it would rather die than be this bad looking
One speed bump that’s the bottom of car wrecked
MAT pozz from Croatia, dont lisen no one car is NUKE bomb..
That thing is SICK!!! Can’t wait to see the road trip with this one! Fuel money on black!! Thx for the entertainment!
Ob buddy, those rims are obscene. It looks like a child picked them out, it's your car in the end so as long as your happy im happy for you.
I have been watching from the rs6 build and just now noticed when you said ''you might have been following the journey but haven't pressed sub'' that I was NOT subscribed wth😅😂
I thought the edit mistake was meant to be made like that like trying to joke about all the different information playing at the same time but LOL
It is unique as it is. The wheels look great on it.
I drove one when it went back to McLaren. Silverstone 😅
Color is amazing. Wheels aren't my favorite but whatev. Keep kicking ass.
...the wheels are hideous..."there is not another 720S like this"...thank God...
Mint colour with polo mint sweet wheels! Shocking....
Hey Matt huge fan love your videos not a fan of the colour on the wheels maybe carbon effect hope the engine isn't very broken
This is a Miami color mix for sure!
The white smoke looks like coolant leak into combustion chamber😢
Only been released 90 minutes ago and 170k  views shows how great your channel is Matt keep it up 👍
Those wheels are the lambo equivalent of 1920s mobster shoes 😂
The back wing looks like the bat symbol!  😂
Great vid ,I've probably got a door hinge for you if you need it
Love the colour & the wheel design is fantastic great design
All that hard work just to ruin it at the end with those alloys 😞
Looks like it's on 15" rims now lol! Awesome build though.
What's the update on Audi rs6
Nice , are you going to put some paint accent on the hood to match the rest of the car .
Wheels look awesome, looks like it belongs in a Tron movie! 'Tron McLaren'
Sitting here nodding my head at the look at the car finished.
I like the wheels but my stomach sank at the end.
interesting choice for the tyres
I must admit when I first saw the mint colour I thought you had lost your mind, but when I saw the finished car I thought it actually does look fantastic, but you spoiled it with those terrible, tacky wheels 😢
The wheels are definitely not my cup of tea, but the rest is of the scale stunning.
Incredible, but never prettier than your GT3
Love it and the wheels do it justice 💡👍
this is why you never buy a British car.   we all know this lol
Am i the only one who sees good ol american car from like 50’s the white (not) tires and even the color seems really retro to me. Original and nice ofc.
Turbos gone?
lovely colour
Cars looking unreal 👏🏻👏🏻
ngl wheels ruined it
That colour way is epic
The Hood isnt called Deckel in German, it is Motorhaube. Deckel means Something Like lit (the thing you close bottles and stuff with)
Love the minty fresh and carbon look. Please raffle this.
In German it´s not Deckel it´s (Motor-)Haube hahahaha (for next time)
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Side skirts don't come from the factory cuz they're unnecessary and pointless 😂
❤❤!!!! Luv It !!
Keep up the good work chaps
Well done guys,I don't think it's a serious problem 😎
Soo a blown head? Engine rebuild video incoming
Those wheels are not it.. Wheels can make or brake a build and everything was looking good till then..
I was shocking by te colour when I first saw it. But it’s a pretty sick mix with the carbon 👌🏻
I HAVE TO RE SUBSCRIBE TO.YOUR CHANNEL ABOUT ONCE A MONTH.....YOUTUBE IS RIDICULOUS!!
as far as the wheels goe, the colors don't make sense. like, the paint wheel sucks on it. paint the white black the black color match the teal or just make them all black... the white looks like something someone playing GTA pushes random when they just need to sell a car... its horrible color pick, the car looks alright imo. normally not a teal enjoyer but this does cook well
Honestly i don't like the build but thats just me,and still better than becoming parts car
The wheels are absolutely horrendous but the rest of it is🔥
30:39 oh oh oh oh engine very bad. laughing at you lot not the car being unwell😂😂😂😂😂😂 you lot crack me up every time. Such a boys adventure. Bloody brilliant🤩 much respect to you all.
What I can I say mat that car looks amazing keep the cars coming can’t wait to see what’s next
No Sunday is complete without a video from mat
Love the colour and the carbon combo, but the wheels .... aweful. Sorry Mat. However, it is your car and you like it, so its all good
The wheels are a no no
Better then goonsqaud
Guess you did not warm the engine enough (head gasket ?)
I was thinking, this car needs whitewalls - your choice was better. bravo!
Fire
Damn it
Hopefully Polo Mint  only has a blown turbo , looks fab ,
32:19 Nope on the wheels for me... maybe better with carbon surrounds then the white? Wish the fenders were painted body colour, and carbon wrap the roof and all other black bits. It's looking a little too pieced together currently.
Best!😊
Car came out fresh. Best looking 720 I’ve seen.
Whitewalls 🤮
Man i enjoy watching you, you are awesome i wished that i was your friend or your neighbor to i help you in your work i love cars also keep up the good work brother
Carbon fenders are not it. Prefer tye color on them. The white on the wheels should match the car color  Great Car though.
Very nice work = this car is definitely 1 of 1
Lot of McLaren's do that for some reason they smoke like that call your buddy in Florida he'll he'll hook you up tell you what's going on
Love the wheels but I think the back ones could be bigger other than that they look unreal
those wheels would have looked amazing in bright orange next to the blue
It’s definitely personal…..
Amazing build, but the wheels are odd, they look very small in the wheel arch and rear don't seem to be flush unless the white hoop just gives it a weird visual.
Getting this on sunday night is now the new top gear look forward to it the as much cheers matt and the gang love the car
those wheels bro🥶🥶
The audio editing is great pleas make videos with musics like this video....
Not a fan of the colour, but the wheels look INSANE! Hope the engine is ok, keep up the good work Mat!
I don’t know YouTubers rebuild these crappy cars. Every time I see one rebuilt on a channel the motors always blow 😮 the rebuild looks great thought awesome job MA
Question because you have put a New tub on it doesn’t have to registered as a Q plate
Omfg is it seized😂😂😂
ngl u the only youtuber that actually does the ad mid videos so it makes u wanna watch the ad to not miss anything going on the car. w big brain thinking lol
The color is great but the wheels are awful
Bloody hell that is one ugly colour combo 🙈
Hmm looks like you might have something in common with Tavarish. Blowing up Mclarens?
I really enjoying seeing mats design ideas come to life. They are never what I'd choose but I like that!
EBay 🙄 I heard the first thing ever sold on eBay was a lazer pen. Which didn’t work
That colour 😮
Well done Mat and team. Looks awesome.  Best of luck with the car, hope it’s an easy fix so you can enjoy your hard work 🤞
So do us Americans have fenders sticking out the sides of our airplanes 😎 with trunks on our feet and hoods on our head. Our elevators help us changing elevations yours just lift
What's the difference between a pound and a quid?
Fantastic build but white on wheels no carbon much better finish
Eww for the wheels
rim trim same color or no?
Some job Mat that's the best looking Mclaren I've ever witnessed..
Another great video but those wheels are dreadfull
Nice build as always ,, as mentioned , and argued about , Deckel is a Lid in german ,, this would be a Haube , or " Fronthaube " since their isn´t a Motor below it ( Motorhaube ) easy way of pronouncing it would be  HOWBA  .. hope the motor is ok m8
Tbf every youtuber that's rebuilt one of these has had white smoke after first drive
Yea not sure on them wheels I thought these are gonna be sick matt picks some awsome wheels..but then...no... they look 2 small like the old school American white walls just doesn't look right
Too good modified 🍑
Its a no on the wheels from me, everything else is fire!
When this car gets registered, will it be the car you bought with the damaged tub or will it be the tub you bought.Also would it have to go on a Q plate.
18:04 In Germany we call it “Motorhaube” or just the abbreviation “Haube”
Sorry Mat, still can’t believe you chose this color 🙆 most importantly you like it 👍
Yeah shocking build quality from McLaren for such money.
This guy Nuts with Talent . Massive Respect Mat and Crew .
Engine saying “habemus papa”
Not a big lover of the wheels but love the rest of the car 👍
It was definitely the wheels that made the engine very bad 😂 still looks killer tho
Wow wasn't sure at 1st on the colour but fair play, you make me want to work on my car
Call it the 720lt lol
Love the colour, not a fan of the wheels but they're definitely unique. Brilliant video as always.
When is mats dad starting a channel
The wheels are not good lol
The white on the wheels need to be the same minty green as the car, in my opinion
Ahh man, gutted for you. Hope it's not too bad. Please body color those rims 😢😢
Well done boys, wheels… i may need time to digest, as i see a 1930’s car with white sidewalls, at first glance. Time will tell. But great effort. Loved the journey.
The wheels...🤔
Matt, when do we get some follow-up videos? Of how the cars are running. Proof that you're getting better!
Is it bad engine?
Wow just wow what a build this is the colour and the carbon is incredible 🙌🙌 another amazing car from the MA team
I exhaled when the wheels went on. What a crazy cool car, I hope the fire isn't bad
Wouldn't it be called a trunk/boot instead of a hood/bonnet? Since the motor is in the back and the front is used for storage.
Im again 1 hrs late 😢😢😮‍💨😮‍💨
The bonnet is not called "Deckel" in german, it is called "Motorhaube" 😅
😎
I like the the wheels but would have done the white discs the same colour as the car
1:19: ooo no……🤦🏻‍♂️ , WTH… you choose that colour….🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ 😀
This mclaren looks sick as f!
Another joyous video. Well done. (However, don't like the wheels or the carbon. Sorry.)
that bonnet kinda looks like optimus prime 😂 love it! 😍
Paint the carbon body parts but leave the vents
It looks like the car out of thunderbirds with those alloys. I mean it still looks amazing. Take the white bits off on the alloys
Looks banging Matt, love the videos and am always waiting for the next. your dad is a legend!
WOW just WOW love the colour and them wheels love all your content thanks mat
That has to be heartbreaking at the time. You're not the first to blow their Maclaren motor immediately after rebuilding it.
These Wheels are soooo fckn insane bro!
Stunning design, 1 of a kind in the best ways possible
I love the channel and respect you for always keeping it real. This build is horrific though. Mint green and those wheels 😢
That color is hideous! One of one? Thank the Lord! Looks like a bar of soap!
Gotta change the orange on the seats to minty light blue also
Wow, those wheels look like something from the film Tron
Those wheels look brutal.  Gorgeous car, but those wheels don't belong on any car nevermind a maclaren.
Don't call it Deckel. The correct term is Motorhaube. 😂
What a build, great work! Hopefully the engine isn't tood bad. The wheels for me, let the car down but as long as you like them. I think the extra bits at the top make them look small and they don't suit the aggressive styling of the car.
31:04 Mclaren doing Mclaren things
matt the colour suckssss
Minty polo freshness
sooooooo beautiful😍
Have you been watching Tron. Looks amazing.
10:30 sack the editor 😂
i love the wheels, so unique
That colour and those wheels, looks sick!!
This reminds me of the light cars in Tron with those amazing tyres and that mint paint scheme... Epic build, love it ❤
Wheel and carbon fender doesn't suit at all. Fender should be painted in mint as rest car. Wheel gold or Cooper would look better and different design.  Like on lamborghini murcielago other than that it's looks rocket spaceship.
Mat’s next title: rebuilding a wrecked koenigsegg agera
You need to paint the wings and leave the Louvres exposed the way it is atm is hella ugly lol
My week it’s all about DDE and MAT And cars
Sick build one of the best looking 720s I have seen.
Great build, not sure of the wheels.
Checkers Sixty60 🇿🇦
That ain’t no private road 😂
Awsome, at first i had mixed feelings about the colour, but when its all together wow... what a car
Mat saying it looks mint, Yeah a Polo mint..... stunning colour but I'm in the other 50% ref the wheels sorry.....
That the colour disabled 3 wheelers used to be 😂
Lovely car but you had me till your visit to wheelmania 😢
Ah man hope it’s nothing serious after all that graft. Keep it up boys.
its the turbo
The body kit, the diffuser, the color are out of this world. But with all due respect 🙏,  the rims are a hard no go, the covers make them look too small.
Monaco Time.
The colour is amazing
It looks amazing apart from the hideous wheels that look like they came of 90s Bugatti EB110 and painted by kid with some rattle cans?
What about painting the wheel rings the same color as the car??? But the car is super sick. Love watching the videos!! Love to meet you one day. I own a shop in Florida.
This must be a generational thing because I think that colour is absolutely disgusting... of all what colours you could have chosen you choose toothpaste green....nasty.
Tony rocking a Datejust while putting the spoiler on is just savage 😂😂😂
Holy shit it looks like an RC car and I love it serious wall poster material I know some will not like the wheels I love how custom it is to you! Insane work I hope its something daft with that engine 😭
amazing mclran build ..but those wheels ...not a good choice in my opinion
20:27
Paint the wheel piece blue too 👍🏾👍🏾great job guys
When I first heard that the chosen color was mint, I thought "say what? Mint? Hell NO!!!" But then, I immediately said, wait a sec, mint with carbon fiber could be a blast. And oh boy, indeed it is". What an INSANE color effect, this car is now... mental! So take note, mint Is mental.
Superb colour and it’s not painted black , well done , great choice, 👍👍👍👍
Love love love your choices on colour and wheels. Lights tie in the white.
Hopefully you didnt do a Tavarish and blow the engine up because the oil was too cold/engine not warmed up.. Waiting for the next episode!
What was the out come of the smoke ? Great build by the way just keep going.
Sorry the roms are terrible
My question would be if the UK roads are safe for this car? 😃
Not my colour combo, but another great build Matt, getting better and better
Hope you're going to paint that carbon fiber front. Carbon fiber most be the ugliest small pp compensator ever.
Such a great creator
Is that Mylanta Green?
You need to run a pole 0n the wheels and change them if people don’t like them
Wheels and  car colour 👏🏻👏🏻 Top of the shelf ❤
Eeeeehhh, Deckel is just the direct translation. If youre looking for the proper german translation, it is MOTORHAUBE
I love that colour.
fingers crossed for you and the guys Mat
Can someone please tell him that we dont say "Deckel" to the bonnet lmao 😭😭 its "Haube" or "Motorhaube" I know the engine is in the back of the car, but accept it or not it is how it is 😂
This wheel “trims” should be minty or carbon-ed for extra matching and style❤
Reminds me of Tron
The door top windows are 3k as they break every few thousand road miles. It’s a huge warranty issue and a lot of people get them taken off for carbon or painted panels. One of the smartest moves you made not fitting the windows back on.
awful color
Absolutely love the paint it’s amazing. Do not like the wheels but still an epic build
I hope u get it all fix feel sorry for u guys
i really really wanna se a roadtrip of this Mclaren
To be fair, it looks mint
You blow the engine
When it's up on the lift, the McClaren looks like a space frog
Is god in
Car looks great i would take the white off the wheels they dont look right looks like white wall tyres
6:10 car guy cringe
This car is fire 🔥🔥🔥
get the white thing off the back wheels it would look way better atleast test how it looks
Amazing,  pure talent mate. 👏 the work put into it, the craftsmanship shows.
Aren't you basically rebuilding a tub and robbing the first car?
WOW! Absolute WOW!
The white bits on the wheels not great makes the wheels look smaller 🤔
Get it to the boys at Infinit performance in Glasgow
It looks mad clean😣🔥🔥🔥
Not a fan of this one Mat, from the side view it looks fat and dumpy, the Carbon wings look odd, on it, maybe if the wings were the same colour, it would look better or pn a black car but it just doesn't look in proportion and breaks the sleek lines and not aa fan of the white rings on the wheels, but its just my opinion and as long as you like it fair enough
Looks completely whack!  Sorry dude.
Yoooo that blue goes hard
I am British
looks sick, yet i think partially colour matching some of the carbon would look even better, like the louvers on the fenders exposed but the the wing itself minty green
Looks amazing ! wheels too.
Love the color and love the carbon. But the front fenders look like an afterthought. IMO
the best looking car I have ever seen it is my new dream car 😍
With those wheels, you can call the McClaren "The Polo Mint"
Quick note, Deckel is not the German word for bonnet. Its Motorhaube is the correct one.
the wheel setup looks soo good matt great job
I love the rims
Love the color
Reminds me of the white wall style tires off a mint green 56 bel air. Its a classic color selection.
Yep the wheels look shite.!! But each to their own.!!
Best mechanic 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 and most money spending mechaniach
The wheels look sick and the car is beautiful! I don’t blame you for keeping it forever! Congratulations! You have done a miracle on this one! ❤
Typical YouTuber style wheel. And the color TAVARISH ::cough:: ::cough:::
Love the channel, don,t love the colour, reminds me of the "Duck Egg Blue" used on Land Rover Lightweight Engine blocks.
Sorry, don’t like the wheels Matt.  Ruin it for me
Love the Tiffany color and the carbon additions but I hate those wheels as they are. To me they cheapen the look of the car. Those white rings need to be either gone or painted satin black.
This car looks awesome! The colour is just gorgeous! Keep up the good work!
Not a fan of the color. but it could work with a livery. modified gulf?
I actually like the wheels
One thing I've always wondered about is why do high end cars with exotic engines lack a basic fire warning system and fire extinguishing system for the engine bays? Yes it would add a few thousand dollars to the overall price but when you are talking about a quarter of a million dollar car or a $50k car it can save a car. Installing one in a car that has gone thru a massive restoration makes perfect sense. I've seen three re-built cars go up in flames on their first drive and be total losses.
Beautiful car, but the wheels. I honestly think they do nothing for that car. Don't hate, it's just my opinion. Epic work again sir.
Horrible colour, WTF, this is McLaren, not chav style Ford Fiesta racer boys dream. Cannot believe, watched and hoped what would be wind up.
Weldon  bro that's cool car alldaway from sa 🇿🇦
Engine very bad!
Matt my Boi you've done it again 🎉
The McLaren has came a long way hopefully this ain't a major thing to fix
The rims are just a new trend...you´ll see.
I would have probably kept it stock, the colour I can deal with, but the wheels and carbon are not for me.
give me a ride
That smoke is because you've overfilled the oil.  The inj and just done a thing on it 👍
Those wheels certainly don't shy away from attention. I'm withholding judgement till I see it in the flesh.
Wheels are perfect
Top job looks amazing 👍👍👍
First this car is nasty 🔥 second, I loved watching this build. I will never rebuild a car, but watching you makes me want if I was inclined 😂 hope the engine isn't shot
Looks like a head gasket
Can someone tell him that bonnet in german is spelled “Motorhaube” and not “Deckel”!!!
Great job Mat! What a build! Car looks insane! For me is just the fenders that are too much, everything else is killer! Keep doing this! You’re very good at it!
You forgot to say in the Y Foods ad that it’s only open to UK residents, learned that on the second channel
Sorry Mat but the wheels need to go and I’d also paint the front to match the rest of the car. Other than that it’s a cracker 🤪
Matt is a gem.
those wheels are so sick
Match the fender paint
as a German i have to tell you that "Deckel" means lid as in the lid of the pickel jar and not the boned. The right  word would be "Motorhaube" (direct translation engen lid).  But as the Mclaren dosent have the engine in the front we would call it the "Kofferraumklappe" (Trunklid). hope this will better your german skills and love your Videos. keep up the work.
Thunderbirds car 😂🤣
It's your car mate, but yeah, you'll be replacing those wheel within 3 months.
Wow, this is one of the best and sick builds I've ever seen. I'm sure like everyone we never think you can trump the last build, but boy you have once again excelled Mat. Congratulations to the whole team 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🥂😍😍😍😍😍😍😎👌👌👌👌🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾
more videos :))wheels in same color as the car not white
Brilliant video well done to everybody for the hard work put into this project 👏 only thing I don't like on this occasion is the wheels. Sorry, but the white walls just don't suit.
18:12 Deckel is like the lid of a bottle or something  Hood in German is "Motorhaube"
omg no way.. plot twist
Matt when you bond carbon abrade both sides I’ve seen on one of your previous videos and this one that you only put the glue on without abrading it.(I’m a composite trimmer that’s what I do for living) Continue doing this!!!! ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
I thought I would hate the mint color but it looks surprisingly good. Now the white rings on the wheels, I am not feeling it
engine very bad
The color you chose is similar to the color of Adam LZ’s new Porsche he got
The colour and the wheels reminds me of the cars in the film TRON
The MatLaren looks epic!
Well done Mat👏 nice colour👌
It's really nice seeing you and your dad working together. I lost my dad in my early thirties. He was brilliant with cars, but we never got the chance to work together as he emigrated to Amerca and died young. Miss him all the time. Thanks for your videos Mat. They make a difference to people. :)
"checked for importing into the uk"... i can imagine the import process into the US, a man with a clipboard that has 1 item on it. "CAR", he checks the item and you're done.
Your title is very confusing
These wheels are so ugly. I like everything else but the wheels
Deckel😅
Love the color scheme! The wheels don't do it for me personally at all though 😅 that white rim makes them look so small and the white itself looks totally out of place.
Nailed the colour 👌👊🔥
Speak to jurgen at JM Imports about some carbon replacements for those glass panels on the tops of the doors 👌
No isssssssues
Change the name of the Maclaren in to MatLaren 😉
car looks amazing mate great work
Night night headgasket
Mat I've never seen a crazy combination like you and your dad😂😂
you make a JDM lookalike  from a mclarem
what a stunning looking car,the best one in your collection you said,,,you better believe it that is brill colour, great vid again,,,also agree with liam a nissan gtr got be soon,,
Car & colour looks good but the wheels look fucking shit
Audi is hunting you *Engine very bad*
Wheels are awful plus how has the replacement tub got ID if it was scrap.
Ah man every car from the m5 competition just keeps getting better and better but that mclaren just tops everything. It's unreal good job mat and team
Truly amazing Mr Armstrong!!! Im inspired!!
😮..oh my dayz..i hope the engine is ok...love the colour,bt i think wheels r not the greatest..!!! They look small.. Cannot wait to c nxt video ,n  engine is ok...🇳🇿🤙
Congratulations looking amazing😊
That's a SUPER NICE PAINT JOB/COLOUR! Pearl? Nice
Stunning car and colour, just don’t like the wheels at all. Excellent job though
Mad respect from 🇮🇳
Is it from being on the ramp/truck at that angle that's dumped oil into places it's not supposed to reach?
Car looks absolute mental mate ! :D
I have watched all your builds for years, and I liked this one the most, so I was so gutted when it caught fire and wouldn’t move, I hope it’s a cheap fix, you do an amazing jobs building these cars, I love watching every video you put up.
I like the wheels, they are giving me Cyber Punk vibes
Well done very nice car matt
Wheels look sick. Anyone who doesnt like them dont have to have them on their McLaren. Wait.. whats that? Oh you dont have McLaren's...
Best looking Mclaren, beautiful.
Stock wheels are so much better, you bought super ugly wheels
I’m glad YouTube started recommending your videos to me but a little displeased that it took them so long
Car looks outstanding.. didn't think I would like the color but hey what do I know.. another great job
A thumbs up to all my colour-blind brothers who can't see that it is mint-coloured 😂
I think it is the best built
Mat, just NO!  Color, carbon, and wheels
I’m sorry but I loved the build until the wheels went on, not my taste
great video Matt hope the car is an easy fix and not an engine out job
Thanks for your videos Mat, today it's my birthday and is not completed without a new video of you. Maybe you didn't know, but you inspired me to be best. thank you so much Mat from a south Spain
Wooooo that’s looking great!! Another Armstrong and son masterpiece, 👍👍
Take the white bits off the rear wheels n 10/10,
Wow does that car look amazing
These videos are the best
Heh, the happy banana is something my friend orders at an Asian massage parlor...
I can feel an engine rebuild coming on hell you got the upgrade exhaust might aswell upgrade the engine if you keeping it just have a word with tavarnish I’m sure he knows someone 😂
The most sincere congratulations to your entire team at taking the channel from sub 1 million a year before and catapulting it to almost 3 million is absolutely astounding hard work truly pays off you guys deserve all the success
Awesome job again Mat but I can’t get onboard with the wheels…it’s a unique look alright but they almost look like white wall tyres and detract from the beauty of the rest of the car. That aside, love your content.
Engine very bad
Hello
We all need the 'Engine verry bad' merch! I'll order it immediately. 😅😂
Matt. I always love your effort, but do not like the colour of the car. It spoils the look and the wheels are just as bad.  Appreciating that opinions are an individual choice, I suggest that the vast majority will agree with me. 👍🙏
UNBELIEVABLE,, 👌
Awesome build Mat!! Not sure about the wheels. Don't love 'em, but also don't hate 'em. However, love the the originality of your thinking. Keep it up mate!
TRON car
Brake light situation made me laugh…🤣Matt will come out with any idea , excuse or solution just not to go back to fix it🤣🤣🤣🤣 but still that was impressive because it makes sense.
The new wheels are so nice and unique but i felt that white is not matching the car maybe another color would have been better well done mat on the build hope that engine is okay
Epic truly mint ❤ GGG-unit !!!!!
so sick! i would defo get the wings painted too though and leave the vents in carbon
Honestly, the best looking McLaren i've seen
Love it, looks Savage!
Finally a nice car matt 😍 great colour  great job   , i might buy one in a couple of years
🚥Those wheels with that beautiful color is freaking epic …Mat love the work you your dad and the team do …great job guys 😎👍🏽
Pretty epic build. Now I want to know what's happening with the RS6
Engine very bad
idk why these rebuild channels dont ever have someone look over the engines make sure its running healthy no tunes
Your videos are sooo fcking good🎉❤
Not a fan of the wheels but it’s not my car. It’s what you like
Damn hope engine isn’t very bad
Awesome work hope the smoke is just oil maybe and love the wheels think would look sweet if the white was black carbon and looks like they just bolt on so could be interchangeable like trainers depends what mood Ur in just I thought 😉  good luck sorting the engine
I'm jealous 😂❤
i can see this guy making his own dealership sometime in the future, where he sells modifications for cars and makes them himself. Kinda like what Smokey Nagata did but without the 300km on a highway as a publicity stunt. Although i couldnt say that i dont see Mat doing that
All mint would have been better, the carbon hood looks a bit off. That's all subjective though.
Matt, you are the best brother. I love your videos all the way from California.  I know you said 50/50 on the wheel choice. Please don't be offended when I say in my opinion I don't care for the wheels😔. They look very similar to what Saturn did for their wheels. They had the rim trims as well.  However, the rest of the car is looking amazing.  Please don't be mad at me. You asked. However, as long as your happy with it. That's what truly matters. Keep up the great work brother. Ron
Such a silly request but can we get a shop tour and clean up for what you do after each car and before the next one? Love to know how you plan ✊
Bro coped stradman wheels
Mat you know you're gonna have to do a Bugatti soon!  You know its coming! 😉👊
Looks absolutely phenomenal…..shame the engine is f***ed..😂
I was going to tell you my true feelings about the choice of wheels, but after seeing the end of the video, I didn’t have the heart.
nice color but your interior is orange maybe you should tan the orange parts   in black or the same blue as the car I don't know if it's possible
Looks like a space 🚀  Awesome build
Please stop calling the truck a trailer.......
Batmobile
Please, I dare you. I'm german and we don't call the bonnet "Deckel" here. I have no idea why they did it on the Porsche that way, but it's called a "Motorhaube". It's so painful to watch. Anyway, love your videos. Keep it up, man!
One of the only youtubers I'll watch the whole video without skipping 🙌❤
Matt, your design choices are generally edgy, challenging, sometimes over-the-top but pulled back from tasteless by some genius touches that bring cohesion and personality to the final product. But this... you need to fix it, seriously, it doesn't work (in more ways than one)! You can't put whitewalls on a Mclaren, because that's what it looks like...
Ive really enjoyed watching this build.  Beautiful car. But those wheels🤦
with the colour contrast and the wheel design it looks almost coachbuilt.
Great build, my favourite to date and a great colour.
Love the car, but im not a fan of the wheels😭hope the engine isn’t blown up🤞🏻
In Germany we don’t say “Deckel”. We say “Motorhaube”.
🫃
Sorry matt the wheels not for me but the rest off it I love
What a perfect colour combo for this super car… absolutely stunning
Not going to lie. Your wheel choice is usually bang on. But not this time. They are bloody awful. 😂
Hi Mat love your work mate, you have great eyes for cars but this time the color and the wheels are just not it.
@MatArmstrongbmx are you going to keep the 720s
Nope to the wheels, mainly the colour of them to be fair
Am i the only one that thinks the hood looks like a face from transformers movie 😂
Mat you and your team are bloody legends the works of art you guys create is insane you get buckets of respect from me - such a pleasure to watch 😎👌
w
The color and wheel combination make it look like it came from the movie Tron. It’s almost like a piece of art, it captures the attention. 👍
is it just me or is audio overlapped at 10:40
It's got a Tron Bike feel to it with these wheels.
Oh the fire destroyed the car, nope them wheels did
then it CAUGHT on fire
Maybe cracked block or leaking head gasket, don't look too good!!!
You said it on fire rip the engine but at the end of video you said it run definitely perfectly and no issues 😒
Not my taste of color , it is in the middle of something. But overall looks good, and those wheels are sick, love it.
PAINT THE TOP OF THE WING LEAVBE BOTTOME EXPOSED
@ 10:30 Voice is doubled :-s
The car looks such a beauti ❤
my days had been mid without MAT but finally he posted 🙂
Typical McLaren 🤣 combustible engine alright, once again class video mate 👌🏻 wishing you and your dad the best
The colour, carbon kit, and wheels are great! Looks DOPE!!! Now you "only" need to fix this burn in the engine.
Big up to the Car wash and detail guys who watch you in Leigh Lancashire, fans of the channel.  Spoke to you on Saturday at Nadines. 👊
This is looking like NFS car but  i ducking love it this Wheels are awesome 😍🔥
Awesome car. I hope Mclaren call you soon because this car looks like a space ship compare to the original car. Congratulations, men. Keep up the good work.
Looks like a tron car
Best channel EVER.. wing it till you make it guys.. your dad is cool..
Damn Matt your taste in wheels are sh.....
She looks absolutely stunning. But im not convinced on the wheels purely as the white sides make it look a lot like a tron car and deceive the eye into thinking the wheels are much smaller than they are so also look kinda like castors. I do love the idea of white with the mint though. How about trying her with the alloy sides removed but actual white wall tyres? Is it possible to get low profile white wall 21" tyres? If not id bet someone would make you some MA whitewall custom specials for her.....
Matt your out there mate . The wheels looked horrible in the shop !. But on the car !! Fantastic!!!
Your dads laugh at that age having the best time ever building a car with you is just infectious.
People making fun of the cybertruck’s panel gaps need to watch these guys rebuild supercars and see how bad they are from the factory 😂
🤦‍♂What a mess, lol. Those alloys are hideous too.
Poor car... it tried to set itself on fire after you drove by the glass front of the building and it saw it's reflection and how ugly it was with that color!  😂😂😂
Matt, love the vid and great Maclaren build but sorry Matt, mint green, black, Carbon, and white on the wheels is too much, it looks to patchy, if you could have had carbon on the wheels it would have looked sooo much better, I also would have done some carbon on the roof to make it flow better, I know it would have cost shed loads
Great work. You're correct on the colour and wheel choice. It suits some and not others. Thumbs down here. Yuck.
Your videos always make me happy. I wish you the best.
G O A T
Oh no!!! It's just like Freddie's McLaren, he just went for a quick drive in his. I know you can sort it mat, I just hope it won't cost an arm and a leg?
Car looks amazing matt well done guys shame about engine hope it's nothing g to bad 👍
Crazy car. But the white trims on the wheels are horrible, the wheels itself look mental😂
Absolutely love the colour scheme.... Gives me real TRON vibes!!
The car looks awesome but the white ring on the wheels look like white tyre walls.
Please paint the Hood and the fenders in Mint 😬
Never even wanted to let a negative comment go about any of your builds Mat, but…… Those wheels are absolutely sh.. 😂
Wheels ruined it
Thought the wheels may look pants but absolutely bang on and that’s gotta be keeper Matt
The McLaren looks fantastic Mat only thing I would charge are the curb covers to Carbon or the Mint paint
My Sunday isn't complete without a Mat Armstrong upload.
i like the carbon kit. just dont like the color of the wings. should be blue like te rest
Well mat what can we say when you showed us the wheels I was like there shit but when they went on the car they look sick pal love this car
Not the bat mobile.. “The Mat Mobile”
Looks like something from TRON! Well done mat lad 👍👍👏
The wheels are a no
Bro in German the „hood“ is not called „Deckel“ but „(Motor)Haube“…depends on if the Engine is under the „Haube“, then its a „Motorhaube“. A „Deckel“ is something that you put on a pot haha😂
I don't care what other people say , Mat your killed it and the car looks absolutely sick, great job overall...
You dont watch the whole video before posting?
Oh god, it’s the same colour as my nans 60’s bathroom!!!! Love the carbon parts ❤, although I would have had the wings the same colour as my nans bathroom too, keeping the bonnet carbon.  Does Hannah know you’re now a PIMP?? 😂 Pimp my ride with those wheels !!
Love your content bro I don’t know why but I get so excited watching your videos I feel like I just want to go fast 😂
Oh god i hate those wheels!!!! Love the color though. Awesome job man
Such a shame about the wheels
This looks so good 👏👏
Nope on the wheels. Old ones looked way better. Good video though.
The car is rejecting those wheels 😂
remove the white piece on the wheels or paint it and then the car is perfect
It looks sick 🏆
Hi Matt the car look out off this world it the best car you have got.
In my opinion the white on the wheels takes away from the car. Maybe body color would have been better. It’s not the direction I would have went. Then again it’s not my car it’s yours and if it fits your style that’s all that’s matters.
One of one chat sounds like you been hanging round DDE too much lol 🤣 cars awesome love watching Ur vids 🤜🤛
that looks sooo sick 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please paint the front fenders and just leave the luvers carbon
Excellent job Mat shame about the engine 😮
The colour looks brilliant ❤
10:30 got me trippin
i will say, too much carbon fiber for my liking, but was well worth all the effort. keep it up matty
That looks so sickkkkk! 😍
engine a start no problem five minute tiding tiding tiding tiding engine a kaput
What a beauty
I thought it was being converted to Right H/D?
Actually love the colour, looks great! The wheels however .... definitely an aquired taste there Mat 🤣 each to their own! Fingers crossed its not 'engine very bad' more like 'engine a bit poorly' 🤞😬
Great video Mat. As always.  1.The colour is beautiful  2. Don't like the carbon fenders. Should keep them standard or paint them and leave the vents with carbon exposed. 3. The wheels don't compliment the aggressive style. They look too small. A super car looks much more aggressive with bigger rims.   Just my honest opinion mate.   You are still a legend none the less. Thank you for such an amazing chanel.
Same color as Jeffrey star McLaren Sena.
It's a Bianchi McLaren ❤
The white on the wheels should be carbon colour
"Engine very bad" should honestly be printed on a shirt as official merch , it become so iconic on this channel LMAOoooooooo  Also hope the engine is an ez fix
“There is definitely no issues” 😂😂😂 I’m dying rn.
Hannah is some lassie putting up with you dreaming about car parts and fixing problems 😂
bros mclaren looks like its from gta now
It usually means that coolant is being burned in the engine, which means that something is drastically wrong!  Great job. Mat & Dad, and team. You did it. That Mclaren looks out of this world. Well done all!
Wonderful, to me from the front it looks like a shark.
Looks stunning 😍,  engine very bad 😢
That car would look cool in ANY color.
Horrible wheels. And the bonnet in a different color, I'm not sure I like it.
The Tron wheels look awesome , Good job Mat.
Such a shame, was going so well -  it looks terrible
Love the channel. Watchin you guys work your way through the exotics gives us the possibility of our own wrenching success. Thanks for doin what you do.
cant be having rhe ims it looks like a clown car , definitely big questions with the integrity of these engines
Send it to cannonball garage..do an U.S.A road trip with the P1.
love it Mat looks lovely since the state it was in at the NEC start the month and i love the mat armstrong Y food i got mine other day since  you may now need to sell more to pay for the new engine  maybe forge it next video ha
Checked this morning for a video to make sure I didn’t miss an upload! 👌🏼
The creativity on the way you present these ads is really impressive, i never fast forward through them😂
Hello from Belgium, I love your channel because you don't often see cars like this taken apart like that. Your dad is so cool, you're very lucky. Best wishes
For me honestly I think the wheels/Rims you had at the back/Rear of the car were  perfect my opinion
Whats with the engine now? something broken ?
By the way: German word for bonnet would be "Motorhaube". 18:02   Deckel means lid or cover :D  Love your videos Mat, thanks for everyone of them 👍🏽
Bro stole stradman's wheels and turned them white instead of keeping them pink bro thought i wouldnt notice
Fabulous looking car.  But 0 out 10 for the worst wheels ever! 😳😳😳
And I get the idea that cars are just adult legos 😂
Love the car looks insane them weels look sick but looks like you have got a bit of inspiration from stradmans weels
It was going so well, but them wheels are nasty aha!
You should let your audience know Subscribing is free, not immediately obvious if you're new to YT, also, subscribe makes you think of a subscription, which automatically sounds like a paid service!!
In the voice of Tony “engine very bad” 😂😂😂 great rebuild! Would have loved the white of the wheels to match the paint
It looks amazing. Wheels looks amazing
THIS IS SICK!!!! You sick, yfood sick, mclaren sick!!!! unbelievable !!! Thank you and your team !!!
oh this car is something else🔥
I get the carbon bonnet, but please: Paint the front wings.  That gap in the mint colour is just hideous.
that is such a BEAUTIFUL car! but them wheels...
Oh my …….
Love the car hate the wheels but it’s still one-of-a-kind❤
That white line makes the wheel visually smaller.
I know it didn’t work due to no tub being available but it’s a pity it’s not RHD.
No 50/50 I generally do not like those Wheels I hope people aren't hanging on you that hard that they're going to actually say they like those Wheels those are made for something else and they're not made for that beautiful car
Looks good except for the bonnet. I would have had that the same colour as body. But emu opinion means nothing I know
Being waiting for this moment since last year love the car and your style keep making these awesome vids love your work😁
Anyone remember them 3 wheelers from the 70s same colour? 😂
My guess is a stuck injector. Try a lighter at the white smoke, it will probably ignite and shoot flames.
Serious tron vibes , wicked build .
Nice one! I like it, its got that cyberpunk vibe to it with the wheels 😊
How to ruin a mclaren😅
Love the  channel and the vids colour is great carbon bonnet wings 50/50 wheels hell no  your taste in wheels not so good this time sorry matt
Loved following this build , but horrible wheels and not a great color 😂
You are the  best!🎉 This should be Netflix series!❤
The mint green colour is inspired  - it looks fantastic!
looks so sick
Ohh Mat it’s Sick well done my Congratulations on this one WHEELS are Ohh Yess there right for this 720S are you taking it to McLaren for inspection I’ll think there be impressed.  Yet another epic Mat Armstrong  build definitely got a Rhythm hope the engines ok NISSAN GTR PLEASE THAT IS SOMETHING TO CAN SERIOUSLY Modify
.. where i can win this car :-)
Your content is one of my defo must watch evertime. Keep up the great work Mat
I can smell that tint as it was peeled off... barf
Bravo!
I loved the video as always but for me the colour of the car and the rims are a NO-NO... Looks like a Barbie car with wheels from a wheelchair. But it is your car and I am glad you like it. I respect all of your work that you've done with the car itself and recording and editing videos for us ! Peace bro :*  :)
I loooove your videos Mat! :D And i looove carbon! but in my opinion, the carbon arches splits it a little, have you thought about paint them in that cool color, and maybe leave the fins in the intake in carbon ? i think it would look fre*kin epic! :D really hope it's nothing serious with the engine !  Keep what you are doing, i'm looking forward to see every video you and your friends are making :D Cheers from Denmark!
Love the car love you Matt but those wheels are ugly an absolute abomination☠️
Awesome color. The body kit looks insane. But I’m gonna say it, the wheels are hideous, makes them look like 15” - but if you like them that’s all that matters. Sick build!
I have been waiting for this video like the chicken 🐔 in the oven waiting to exhale😂
love the car coler and the wheels ar on point
OMG..wow wow what a car..absolutely love love it...❤
The Orange and Blue reminds me of HotWheels, very nice
That wheels... ughhh... crap
Man, the mint is mental... but the combination with the Mango is simply fugly. Please change that Mango into an accompanying mint and this McLaren is BEYOND mental.
Amazing build ❤
🤘😎🤘🙏💨🇬🇧
Great job 👏
The ice spice type beat had me distracted 😂
Great content, awful color and wheels though 😉
Sundays used to be top gear........ Now it's Matt Armstrong night.
Yea not feeling the wheels but thy go with the car .another sick episode of Matt and the lads having a crack . P.s the wing is 🤯 mind blowing 😂😂😂
The car is absolutely amazing but those rims wheels....😵‍💫 I hope the engine is ok!
10:30 is actually a PERFECT example of Mat's extremely developed ability to do a lot of things at once, he's actually speaking like this often; however his Dad is the only one that understands. It's a shame we're simply not advanced enough to understand their efficient communication method. Respect 😎
British version of stradman but you built the car vs him buying a rebuilt title. Both by each and its not a knock but congratulations, it's beautiful
Quality car and video 👍🔥
I thought you would literally set it on fire not even joking
Wheels ruined it
I hadn't had a big interest in cars but then I found you and now I'm really getting into it ❤
Those wheels are 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍🥰💪🏻🤩
Such a nice build. But does the wheel take the most amount of attention?
Amazing Build.  Awesome colour.  Not sure about the wheels but does it make anyone else think of that old TRON film?   Well done Matt.
Dde needs to learn from you and how to fix cars in under a year haha sucks head gasket ?
Love the car mat love the colour excellent achievement only spoiled by the wheels sorry.
I am german and we call it Motorhaube. Directly translated to Motorhood or Enginehood
Ah mate what a shame!!!  Hope you get it fixed soon. Also, the wheels are sick! 😘
The 720 looks 🔥🔥 😅 even the wheel are something else!!! But I really expect a bit of orange on the wheels. Excellent work mat and the team
Mat has single handedly motivated me to start my own car project
Mega carbonjob 👌👍 the hinge revitalisation was epic 😅 awesome stuff u guys 💪✌️ but the engine is very bad 😢
Love your videos mate! As you mentioned you chosed very unique rims and colour I think it looks very good!
I love when Mat's dad says "..all OUR subscribers.." truly a corner stone of these builds!
The wheels do look insane... but the white surrounds on the actual alloys make them look a little bit small for the car. Maybe 21s or even 22s were the play on that front
That’s so libertywalk with the colour     Or gulf with the orange
Same colour as an Invacar. The 3 wheeler Invalid carriage from the 60s & 70s
I'm not personally fan of the color, but no hate love the videos :)
Man that looks sharp, love the contrast of blue with black and carbon. Wheels,  i like full blacked out better  but thats personal. Big Up!
Nice 👍
We need to see an aventador or urus rebuild
great  build but those wheels are rank, hope the engines ok.
Love the car matt think the wheels with the white rim spoils it 🤷‍♂️
I'm not sure about the carbon front wings, but they sure do look better than those on my nonexistant mclaren
Nice, the only thing I dislike is the fenders/wings to be carbon. It breaks the lines.
Oh hell yes.Mats back,and with a bang🔥Gutted about the fire at the end.The McLaren looks insane Mat.Great colour choice.But,I’m sorry to say,I’m not a lover of the white wheel trims.
Another amazing transformation. Keep the great work.
Love that colour - Porsche mint green is one of my favourite colours but it doesn't seem to photograph well and looks so much better in real life - bet the colour on yours is amazing in person too.
Those wheels are absolutely disgusting.
Ugh, even if you don't like cars all that much, these videos are still always a treat. Keep keepin' it real Mat and crew!
Wheelmania....Matt's second home
Wheel mania go above and beyond every time. Shout out to those guys
Wot appened? Did the car burn down?
the wheels look dope, hope you can get it on road soon!
Well Mat, you have done it again! Only discovered your channels on the 5th Jan this year and I am almost through all your car videos, I am addicted! Being an ex Leicester lad myself just adds something extra, I feel like one of your best mates and have never met you 😂 I love everything about what you have achieved, I love you, Hannah, Kevin, Tony and the rest of your crew. Just keep it up Mat, I wish I had your drive, enthusiasm and positive attitude to life, you really are an inspiration.
I know it said Deckel on the Porsche but it's Motorhaube in German which means engine cover.
Mclarens in a nutshell 😅
Wheels look shit.
Good insight, the car is 100, but them wheels... YUK! those rings look like them aftermarket plastic wheel covers you buy at Aldi
Here for the Y Food ads Mats alter ego is immense
White walls on a McLaren certainly is a choice
Outside part of the rims need to be mint like they car otherwise it looks like you have undersized wheels on it.. But epic build Matt and love the way your dad is so involved something I could only dream off..
There’s a bit of audio overlap mat
THIS LOOKS SO FUCKING GOOD HOLY SHIT!
Great example of my McLarens are absolute trash
I don't want the video to end 😭
Hey guys ive noticed a mistake in editing 😅 Late nights editing take a toll on you... I guess thats what makes Youtube Youtube though! We all human 🤟
Mat i watch your videos everyday when they come out keep up the good work ☺️🐐
Panel gaps are pretty poor from factory
Hi matt I've always been a subscriber to your channel but lately I've had to keep subscribing to your channel cos it keeps unsubscribing me for some reason I've never put a rude or bad comment ever either I don't know what keeps happening
That is without a doubt a sexy looking car - I'm not normally a fan of body kits, but this one looks awesome.
No class, the colour and the wheels says it all, is painfull to look at it how horrible it looks. Made in India direct. 😂😂😂
using the amapiano sound
Vogues on a McLaren
I think the white rings on the wheels should be mint or carbon but it looks so aggressive 👌 what a car what a job done!
A loved the car and the colour but a think you wasted it with the wheels…… it looked well smart with the original wheels 😅
I hope I’ll see another one video with registered McLaren that Mat drives like a hell (no fire).
I know mags are a personal thing for any guy.. But jesus, dude.....😢😢😢..no!!
You ruined it with the colour Matt 😡
Love that colour 👍
Why am I getting the Tavarish vibe. ..... Oh yeah... first you have to run it warm before sending it and it will throw a rod or something... New engine coming up. You can do 2 engine installes in 1 day challenge. The RS6 and this one.
Yes another video!
Audi update?
That colour choice is absolutely class. Properly class.
Germans say Motorhaube for the Hood. Deckel is more like Lid but for everything that has a Lid.
Those wheels are absolutely horrible!!!!!!!!!!
It looks cool with the Carbon fenders but I feel like it might be more bad ass if it was painted and left the louvers carbons
hideous rims
What a end 😢😢😢
Hiiiii
Man that color is absolutely PERFECT!!! Great choice!
The rims reminds me of the RS6. What's the update on it?
*pushes glasses up nose* ACTUALLY, we call the bonnet a Motorhaube, not a Deckel.
Engine blowing up was karma for putting on those awful rims.
Personally I love the personal look you have done with this 720. The wheels are crazy, before you fitted them i thought that's going to look crap but once fitted. Yea I get it. Look amazing. Great video mat . .. ps did your dad finish the Ferrari?? He needs his own video channel 💪💪. Great guy . Look forward to the next video 😁
How else wait for another video. Always bangers. Keep it up 👍🏾
When he put the bumper on,I thought he was going to change the name to McLaren to Matt Claren. Damn what happened!? Damn I hope it’s nothing crazy! Fingers crossed 🤞
White wall tyres - hideous😊 Turbo charger has blown
U should have listened to the song “Dupe - Diablo Freestyle “ before burning it again 😮😮
matt ,watt a lady she is your fucking brinniant
Dude, that colour looks sick
Wheels look crap so does the exposed carbon front wings
Where is the Audi RS6???????
Sorry for the sad ending😢 but the Car looks incredibly stunning and unique😊😊😊..Love❤ it
Pleas paint the front carbon fenders, its like triggering me, it cuts the flow of the color!
Well matt…your car looks very good. But the rims look like scheisse.(German).keep us posted on the engine.
"luckily i have one"
Car looks “Mint” mate
I feel like I shouldn't like the look, but I do. Gutted about the white smoke. But at least it's content 😢
In german we say:  „Motorhaube“
Now my day is complete watching from Nigeria 🇳🇬
Another amazing journey Mat - Hammond IS waiting your arrival - if you auctioned this it would sell 100k tickets easily - think about it....
Similar colour to my old mongoose decade bmx
It's sick!!!💯
Glad you didnt go for black or grey. The blue looks great
The wheels 😩😩😩… my opinion only, but Noooooo! Love the colour, the whole makeover, I just dont like them
Well worth the wait👏🏻
You should paint the front fenders and leave the vents exposed carbon
Amazing❤️💚👍🇬🇧
if matt uploaded 3 times aweek id cancel my netflix
i thought i was trippin but edit error @ 10:35
It reminds me of the speedtail
car
Looks like you are going to have to remove the engine
You should do the outer lip of the wheel rim in the body colour.  And also a body coloured strip across the wings from the front bumper to the doors.
head gasket somehow? thats coolant smoke if ive ever seen it lol
Please do something to my bmw 640i….?!?!
Could be a coolant leak into the combustion chamber 😢
DDE Mclaren also smoked like that and the problem was that they overfilled the car with oil
It's just beautifuck
That is your first Color that is perfect for a car because a lot of your cars have garbage color
Awesome build, we'll done Mat and all the best for future..
That looks absolutely insane. Not 100% on the wing being up permanent, but damn that kit is bonkers
The colour looks mint!👌🏾 I don’t like the wheels but they are good if you love them Mat!🤷‍♂️
The car is lovely Mat except the wheels 🤮
O dear me i thing some else had and issue like this in the USA that also build wrecked cars but I just can't think 🤔😂😂😂
Absolutely amazing all that effort and money... Then put ridiculous wheels on . 😱 What a plonka....
Mat I really enjoy you and your dad working together.  I miss my dad. i wish nothing but the best for you both.
18:03  It's Motorhaube in German, Deckel is quite generic - lid :D
Yeah I love it, one thing I would done different: the roof , I would go for carbon panels as well ,not carbon painted black
Take the white bits off the wheels please !
the rims are fire toooooo man this is really satisying
It looks like a beast  ،the color and the carbon and also the wheels are inspired by Mansory ?
Please don’t be engine out - top work so far guys and it’s a thumbs up for me
the white on the wheels needs to be minty body colour
The wheel does not look bad, its just the white that makes the rims themselves looks small. Like 18 inches with massive tire wall. But hey, its your car and I love it still!
Erm did you warm up the motor before you mashed it??🙈  Colour and carbon 👌 Wheels 🤦‍♂️
Hate the wheels, but brilliant job everywhere else
Great colour choice ❤
You should do the stradman thing and make it full carbon
I would colour code the wheels maybe? The outer rim bit?
THE WHEELS ARE SO HORRIBLE IT DECONSTRUCTED ITSELF!!!!
Is the Vin not stamped into the tub?, and you’ve replaced the tub. How does that work?
Never thought your content could be this addictive.  Love the dedication you put on to the builds  and to your subscribers.   Massive massive respect.
Just eie wow.  That’s just, expected it to be awesome looking but didn’t expect that.
Im not sure i like the white on the wheels, but a carbon black would be banging 👌🏼👌🏼
Gutted for the engine!
Wheels 👎🏻
Wow  Looks like from the future !
Car came out amazing , In my opinion the white portion on the wheels should match the body color that would look insane!
I think the McLaren looks sick
Fenders need to be painted,messing with my OCD
New upload mat!  I've been waiting for your upload!  Its 2 a.m right now here in the Philippines!
Got some real Tron vibes with those wheels, the car looks phenomenal! Outstanding work!
This is amazing to see, I saw this car when it was completely totaled in the Netherlands. I was like "What a shame that such a beautiful McLaren is completely totaled". A few months ago I found your Youtube video about you buying this car in the Netherlands. I was completely in shock to see that i recognised the company you bought in from, that was the moment I realised that it was totaled McLaren close to where I live. It felt like such an coincidence, because I never heard of your Youtube channel before this. I am happy to see you rebuilding this car and giving it such an make-over. I hope to see you driving it safely for many more years. 💪
Engine Very Bad 😂
Tron
Such a beautiful car which now changed to a f*cking pimp car 😢 love the content though
Matt you have over lay of audio
Looks good mat, really enjoyed watching the video with a glass of wine, beats watching country file on a Sunday night, 😂😂😂😂😂👍
Matt wow !!! But the wheels are awful...like awful
this will be a #1 on trending video
Brand new second hand McLaren.😂 At last you said almost brand new but it is totally brand new .
Wheels looks real good
Anyone else think the color with that much carbon in the front doesn't look right?
The scary music during the diffuser installation is sick
Awesome video as always
You should paint the white parts on the wheel the same color as the car. Just my opinion. It’s your car though brother!
Not completely sure on colour mate but the rims do finish it off, very sexy wheels. Great build!! 👊🏽
White calipers and I think is a match
just listen to 10:30
I love it pls color match the wings and leave the loovers carbon
10:30 umm what happened to the audio?
Let me get that Wide Food banana in the states
If I had a nickel for every 720S whose engine went at the end of a build, I’d have two nickels. Which is not a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice
After all that you blow the engine 😂
Been waiting all day for this. Looks and sounds great.
Sorry Matt dont like the wheels.  And the tyres pulling back just does not look right.
Just ordered 6 limited edition Y Food & a Starter pack to try 🤞🏻I get the carbon disc to it would look awesome on garage wall
bro this man is  inspiring me to become an automotive engineer day by day ......
Gutting man hopfuly it's a quick fix 🤘
Big fan from India ❤
Mat fixes and breaks another one! 😂
@10:37 there seems to be an issue with the audio overlapping one another :)
Technically you didn't say which Christmas 😂
Beautiful color
Do a color match on the wheels.
I can't get enough of your videos, waiting for each one is pain
hehehede 😅😅😅😅 finally 🎉
Bro those wheels ☠️
Matt is the super car guru now ...congrats!!!
As a German Viwer what the hell is a ,,Deckel,, we call it ,,Motorhaube,,
The Impossible Is Possible
I WAS SO FREAKIN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE CAR LOOKS FAB
74662 in 30 minutes... Mental... ❤ keep up the good work🎉🎉
Love you Mat ❤keep on coming with this content I love it...
Holy shit that 720 looks clean with that paint
My god wow car looks absolutely beautiful what a colour carbon fiber looks 10/10 wow ❤
The rims would be better if the white part of the rim was painted mint
Marmite colour n wheels but what a brilliant build
I would love to know the final cost of this project. Just so we can compare the price of a used one compared to what you ended up paying for yours.
well done m8 fair play 👏
We dont say ,,Deckel“ we say Motorhaube.
The Mat Mobile....sick !!
Sorry Mat, great work, S*** color!
Colour not my cup of tea, reminded me of 70s bathrooms,  lol great build though.
Gives killer whale vibes
Stunning, Absolutley Stunning. Great work Matt
whats the Melodie called at 4:59
Congrats on a quality build.  But personal opinion the wheels look awful 🤗
What happened to the audio at 10:30
I love everything about this, but the wheels. Just not my cup of tea. But fingers crossed the smoke isn't too much of an issue.
just goes to show the build quality of the McLaren's. looks like hell. but you're doing a great job.
❤
Ohhhh Nooooo! White smoke is never a good things. Might be coolants in the combustion camber. Wish you luck!!
Those wheels!!!! 🤤🤤🤤
McLaren are confirmed garbage
I’m blown away with the finish matt I love it!! And the wheels are MENTAL as you say!!! Ps looks like it belongs in the movie tron!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Noooo ! engine very bad 😢
Mate, it looks like something out of Tron! Love it 👌
Please use this car at gum ball 2024 🙏🏽
720s sponsored by spearmint polos😂😂😂 like it.
We can't wait to see a road trip in the in this beautiful car❤
Nah not carbon fenders and hood😭pls
Colour was perfect!
Mat. proper word for those plastic things...... Shim's.
Please tell me your going to repaint the wing that's one colour too much. The mint black and carbon looks stonking 👍👍👍
Oem wheels were class
I want to be entered to win the brake disc but I'm in the USA and can't buy Y Food. I would love to buy it but they won't ship to the US. Bummer.
Upgrade engine rods
the wheels are shite. sorry mate just being honest.
Stunning car guys.
10:34 bad editing of your voice, sound is on top of each other
Man that car is probably one of the most gorgeous Mclaren ive ever seen good job man
Had some audio layering at 10:30 love the videos may not hating just letting you know my guy
It kinda look like mansory maclaren
well, if you do not look behind you when driving there is no fault. just remove all mirrors and nothing will be obvious
Matt, you do you that looks amazing  all that don’t like it.  There just jealous.
Absolute joke how your turning cars like this around!!! By far the best build youve done mat 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Amazing.... What a journey. Thanks for sharing
Is it in Switzerland cause I love yfood and I love your channel and I'm not allowed to order anything so can I get it in a store
The large panel gaps are weight savings.
Needs a nickname Mat - The Green Panda?
it is not "hood" or "bonnit", its called KOFERRAUMDECKEL
Insane color, well done!!!
Imagine a collab with Mat and Whistlin Diesel
Y food needs to come to the US!!
Not a fan of Matt's design ideas. Never like the bodykits or the wheels 😬
Your dad's laugh is infectious, the man is a legend.  You guys take tragic cars and make magic bro.
Congratulations, what a transformation. It looks very striking.
18:03 „Deckel“ if you are german xDD  the real name would be „Motorhaube“, but i know that this comes from that one part which said „Deckel“ xD
Carbon is overplayed nowadays and adding random panels to be carbon fiber just looks wrong.
beautiful colour on that mclaren, also just wrap the black so it matches
What a car!!! Fantastic work mat!! Love the McLaren 720s! Also got me some MA yfood too!! Thanks mat!! Keep up the great content 👍🏻
Fresh
Matt that  McLaren looks sick son  Great color  combo with  carbon fiber
sadly as a german i can´t get your yfood.
Actually Mat...you can do the same with the BMW Z1. Remove panels for paint.
Great looking car. My opinion i would of gone black or orange but each to there own 🤘
Love the car and colour matt
Nice choice of music in the intro! I played that Beethoven sonata on the piano before
Paint the fenders and leave the louvers carbon
"dekkel" is wrong, it's motorhaube in German :)
The fender should be painted and leave the vents as carbon
Lets hope it wasnt a moneyshift😂😂
Pls stop saying Deckel, the bonnet or hood doesn‘t mean Deckel in german it means Motorhaube 🙏😂
DID I JUST HEAR DUAL AUDIO AT 10:30?! BUT MAN LOVE THE CAR!!
Looks insane 👍 One of a kind beauty!  A little fire’s not gonna hold you back
I just love this channel and family so much! Thank you to all of you for the great content! I will admit though, I’m really not a fan of those wheels. Don’t think it suits it at all and the white trim makes them look really small. But, that’s what makes us all different and so long as you love them Mat, that’s all that matters! What a build though! Congratulations!
That’s absolutely stunning what a build great series 🫡🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Mat discount for Yfood is only for the UK. In CH, the discount code is not working.
Bro! Is crazy!! I love everything what you made to this Mc!! I prefer your English videos even I from Mexico 🇲🇽 hahaha lol I want to see your new project!
20:27 What is that face and noise 🤣. Love the videos, keep going!
Mat’s dad is the best ever.  I love his laugh and attitude about everything!!!!!!!!!!
I am now definitively convinced that Mat sees colors differently than I do.
I cannot stop watching this guy. He is really good lad
Wow Matt excellent choice of colour 👌💯
Do you have a kettle in that place? You can't fix cars without tea.
whos here before he realizes he messed up his editing
German call it „Motorhaube“ not „Deckel“😂 For the closure of a bottle, for example, we say a lid. But like that how you think about all your Followers of all different Countries❤
18:03 "Deckel" is not the german word for hood the actuall word would be "Motorhaube". :) Deckel just means lid.
Looks quality 🔥🔥🔥
We here to mark the register we present Mat😂👊🏾
u have no idea how excited i was for this episode
OOOOFFF..... what a color man.....Amazing!!!!
Love it mat pastel colours always look best imo great choice looks mint
Can’t wait for the RS6 video🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
10:40 voice problem ?
Mat: 20:27 hoooooooooo
I love the fact that Mats energy and videos haven’t changed, his personality is still top tier ❤
Hood=Motorhaube in german 😅
10:30 not sure if this is an editing issue, but great video regardless
Full exposed kit
Hi Matt
Why is Mat overlapping at 10:30
Love it ;)  Btw. it’s „Motorhaube“ in German not „Deckel“ ;)  Edit: it is not right what I said. It is normally „Motorhaube“ there isn’t a motor 😂. So I guess it ist „Kofferraumhaube“ 🙈
Not sure what hurts most, those wheels or the fire.
It would have been better if the wings were mint as well. Yeah and the white piece on the wheels also looks off. Otherwise quite a piece!
Cant buy the limited edition of yfood here in Holland 😢
You should put forged carbon package from ECPS would look stunning on that car
Although probably a good idea to get a new door hinge, but the way you think around a problem to make it work is top notch 🤘🏻
It’s Haube in german!😅
bit to much carbon as i would say
I love that color. It’s something you don’t see often. This car is totally insane. I think it’s probably my favorite car of yours now. The 720 has been my dream car for a while now. I would take a 720 over a p1. They’re just nasty.
Love the color man!🔥
Love u bro
This is looking awesome Matt and co great job with this one and all the others, it has got to be time that @hotwheels we had a Matt Armstrong line of cars base on his fabulous cars and colours
10:30 i thought i was trippin
such a shame matt, be a easy fix for ya.
Imagine making a intro for a Audi TT in a flooded garage not knowing you would make a intro with a McLaren 720s in the future...  🙌
I love that colour !!!
Colour and wheel selection on point EVERY SINGLE TIME 👌🏼🤘🏼
18:03 What? "Deckel"? It's of course "Motorhaube". Never assume Germans can't find a longer word than necessary ;)
For each like this gets i will take 1 pushup and 1 situp
Never heard anybody once uses the word „Deckel“ for the hood 😂✌🏼🇩🇪
Glad to have some good stuff to watch today! Thanks for keeping us with the content man especially since others in the youtube car world are slipping on content delivery! That's why you are one of the best!
I think the car smokes because it doesn't like the new rims 😂  Tavarish's 765LT smoke the same way after it's first drive
Some weird audio at 10:30
Colour looks sheet!!!
crazy good color 😎
The colour is perfect
What I would do to hopefully one day own a car from the McLaren brand is immeasurable
McLaren Roll Coal
funny just seen shell at nec ha
Some issues with the voiceover at 10:35 mate
Absolutely love this channel!....been a day one fan!
That is very minty I love it
that colour with the orange look terrible they deff do not match
Audio is messed up at 10:30 btw
I see Mat was a little tired when editing around the 10:30 mark
Thx so much u kept ur word
What is the white strip on the outside of the Rim? Just decorative, or is it supposed to increase air flow for brake cooling?
Mat I’m liking the color!
Was there a weird double voice over at 10:30 for anyone else?
10:30 I started checking all my other tabs to see where else was playing a video lol. Great video Mat and team! Love this Mclaren!
Love that color
Audio is screwed up at 10:30 - some over lapping going on....
Whyrin loomb
Ahhh whats happening at minute 10:00 with the audio
Mat make rs6 video and whats the condition of it
The fact that the front window is cheaper than a r32 skyline window is mind blowing 😭 very upset my glass is broken and can't afford another one
wow 33k views in 14 min is wild keep up the work
Mat, you are very delighted with this car just because it is British. Unfortunately, not everything British is the best. The car in which line up panels were used does not look very good in terms of quality
Mat is the man
Lookin good
Oh no! Engine very bad!! 😳🤷🏼‍♂️😩
Literally just stopped watching manchester united for this 👌
R34 ! Com on Matt, give us some JDM
Ten and a half minutes in your voice is overlapping itself
Waited ❤
are you serious the mclaren 720s is on fire man that's messed up but i know you can do it you were made to fix and repair that's broken your so good at it keep up the good work my fan mat👍👍👍👍👍
first W
Pastel types of green is the new nardo grey😂
10:39 sounds like double audio
Dang...I thought you were only supposed to set bmw's on fire when they become too expensive to fix at the ends of their lives...now McLaren too! What's this world coming to.
You should call it Minty. Just call Jimmy Broadbent to get his blessing first😂
Mat the audio is cocked at around 10:31
It will be the best of All time....
That color looks absolutely stunning mat great job😂❤
💪strong
Sorry, that paintjob is just nauseatingly distasteful...
well done mate!
On fire😢😢😢😢😂😂😂😂
Watch it all in one sitting would watch it again❤️!
I LOVE Tony's awkward laugh.
Miami vice pink look it up for the tail
🔥🔥🔥🔥
the color is really sick
get ready guys,   "I set a rebuilt 720s on fire THAN REBUILT IT" 🤣  edit:   "..... in 24 hours" 😆
Wait it did WHAT
Only thing that matters is if YOU like 'em :-)
Man I really love the new colour of the McLaren ❤🎉🎉
Haven't seen the end product yet but I'm not keen on the colour 😮
These types of colors fit McLarens a lot, great choice
Notifications didn’t work. Love the color
Can’t lie the wheels ruined the build:((
Ltes go Mat ❤️🙌
Bro, I found your channel like a week ago and I've been obsessed. I've gone through five of your rebuilds already. 😂
Iam addicted to your content 😭
In less than 5 years this man has gone from fixing cheap cars to building and modifying supercars! That’s unreal mad respect Mat love the videos❤❤❤❤  P.s please buy a Nissan GTR already 😂
Matt for the win he never disappoints. And the car is truly amazing.
I thought that color was only seen coming out of a toothpaste tube.  😆
Powerful 💥
Respect the work always 😤❤
Was waiting for this vid ! That color 😮😮
Is this going to be a personal car? Nevertheless great build Matt! Those wheels look like the ones on Stradman's Aventador!!
Yeaaaa
PPL who saw the video in a minute after uploading and thought u r gonna make the car look fabulous
i think this mclaren and stradmans pink aventador could be soo matching
New work of art is ready ❤❤
One cooked engine 🔥
Hi from Sweden
i hope it didn’t burn completely😭😭 posted 5 mins ago😭
Minty actually looks pretty sick!!
Sorry, like the progress, but those wheels are an absolutely no go!!  Sad ending.... lets hope that its turbo related, but mclaren engines is prone to head bearings failure...:-)
cant lie i thought he was gonna set it on fire with a literal matchsticl from the title lol
New art of work is ready ❤❤
Perfect colour
It's being like forever ❤ since i came across your channel I've watched all videos really appreciate your work ❤

SUPER stoked about the color man! Too many super cars in boring white or black, you always pick great colors for your projects, the light teal here looks SO good.
