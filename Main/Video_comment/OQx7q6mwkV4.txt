I'd love to play dnd with you !!!!! My character is a dragon person too!!!!
15:10 that was a jerk more! I Think he could have easily been redeemed! Maybe this is what depression evolved for!
3:40 aoutowrite also thought it was lop!😂
This sounds les like a movie and more like a weird amateur game-jam-game, or like a Mario-Dance-game! Edit: or maybe weird game-show!
Are you affiliated with Dingo Doodles at all? I could swear I heard that bit about disgusise-self into Mark's ex as a side tangent in one of the Fools Gold episodes at some point lol. But with a little more detail about the acid attack lol.
4:15 over the garden wall reference!
I LOVE being chaotic evil characters. It’s so fun to just be crazy and make your dm and all your “teammates” “hate” you.
This video has been out for 2 years and I only just now realized there's a critical role easter egg . . .
"Almost everyone I've ever met absolutely loves it!" I wish I was that lucky!
I Like Turtles
Hey why don't you do another game 😅🙃
The wand blast animation felt POWERFUL.  Great animation.
at the start of my campaign my party just blew up the town hall

1:16 I really love the Vox Machina Easter egg.
15:30 I feel bad for him
Larry pokemon minecraft ender dragon and ranboo all kill mr. Walmart
We need someone to animate all of this or just one part with msm monsters
Absolute cinema
i once played d AND d in my local libRARY where me and my party were elfs and we were trying to kill a evil version of santa claus
I love this video. Now I have inspiration for my next campaign! Thank you very much!
O had my forst D&D campain Last month ans let me tell you ot was holsome I like how you made youre character and how you animated it s-o you have a spell on youre tounge(why there tho)
I think you captured the essence of DnD/TTRPG perfectly!
I would love to play d&d but everyone i know doesn‘t play and i can‘t meet people in my contrs who plays it because nobody likes things like that
This is my 25th time watching this
Is it me or does Alpharad look like a gym leader in Pokemon
My cat started meowing in the middle of this, and I thought it was the show😂😂😂😂😂
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
PHB???😂😂
This is one of the funniest things I have seen in awhile
Best game ever I rilly like dark elves
i love dnd
si algun otro hispano hablante ve esto que sepa que no fue el unico que no entendio saludos viajero de internet que por alguna razon mira un video en un idioma que no entiende
1:13 vox machina reference !!
1:28 The wind waker tune is so perfect here.
MOREEEEE PLEASSSSR
1:15 gotta love the Vox Machina cameo
What classes are you all playing
3:15 I KNOW WHAT THAT SPELLS! "speak with animals" i was looking through my pinterest for dragon references and found the alphabet you wrote :D
Sounds like an epic adventure! Can't wait to see how it goes!

THE TURTLE BEING LIKE "UH UH IDFK TURTLE??"

ah yes clay how delicious.... how the heck are you not taking poison damage for that???????? YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY??????????????????? What is wrong with you did you what your characters to probably die????? Is there a reason you did not get poison damage?????? While I get poison damage for eating raw meat when my character is a carnivore!!!!! HOW!!!!!!!!!!! also love the vid.😶❤‍🩹
In my current campaign I’m literally playing as a flying dragonite that shoots enemies with a shotgun (I have a skill that pushes the person shot with the shotgun 10 ft away from me; hence, I can shoot someone 10 ft into the ground TvT)
Bro just kick Mark in the balls
Charlie made a video about dnd but low budget
Vox machina
1:15 - I love the Critical Role/Vox Machina reference at the start with: Vex, Keylith, Pike, and Grog drinking in the inn.
Weirdly enough my first character I ever made in dnd was a dragonborne with acid spitting powers (also this means the colour of my dragon was black) k wonder where I have seen one before
i am totally gonna steal the clay statue puzzle
Did anyone else notice that Jaiden casually shoved Vox Machina into the background of the oak tree?
The party just eats the clay?!! So like a regular group to do anything but the obvious.
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome oh look at that a nat 20

Oh hey I think I have this module
Joke’s on you. I’m not subscribed
When are we getting a part 2??
Mark Thompson did the Mr. Crabs small violin.￼
Thompson like a thompson or just the name Thompson?
D&D's flexibility is easily sold when one can explain how the game can be as silly or as gritty, as wholesome or as degenerate, as fast-paced-OP or as difficult and grindy, as political or apolitical as the group decides. Key phrase being, "as the GROUP decides". Don't ever forget that not playing D&D at all is far better than a bad game of D&D. Know your group, know the boundaries, and you'll have a good time if you fit into the picture.
happy with the launch of your fursona jaiden
My brother played D&D.
Dungeons and dih?
I played and DM’d in the early 80s through uni days… glad to see it’s popular again…
and im basically writing a whole book about species and the charater i created is Dr finnly
One time when I was playing Pathfinder at the library, my party and I stopped two devils from divorcing after we discovered one their true names— Philistophenes, or just Phil. Later on, they were both redeemed and became angels.
hey i play dungeons and dragons at my school
She added eye stalk😂😂
8:23: "ITZ WURMIN' TIME"
15:25 yeah it didn’t go how I thought it would
Ok, I’ll in subscribe

15:03 😂😂😂
trying to actually imagine this as it went in real life is so fun
You should react to legends of avantris animations....its dnd
14:24 maybe this time we'll get him. team attack
For real mark tombson isn’t even the villain
Hmmmm looks like a big lizard and called su? Sounds a bit familiar in deltarune
It would be cool to see another DND video this one was fun
Why does Paul look like jacob
You had me at "Ye Olde Mart of Wal".
vox machina reference lets go
So Paul never got to fight his bad guy?
11:39 I just imagine that kirby falling scream😂
this felt like a movie omg i love
1.25x for normal talking speed 0:01
DRAGONBORNS DONT HAVE TAILS (i actually dont care they look cooler with them)
Alpharad is js frikin larry from pokemon sv

Larry after losing his job 1:31
4:15 "There is only me. There is only my way. There is only the forest, and there is only surrender" ~ The Beast
you should try demon slayer I think you might like it
15:28  killed me- WHAT A DRAMATIC MOMENT THEN JUST ACID BLASTS THE POOR GUY! And Paul just staring as Ranboo and Slimecicle are laughing so hard
Am i the only one who knows that the birch is from doors😅
0:28 this made me realize I wasn’t subscribed. It worked.
Love that you gave the wife and kid each a mustache hahahah
I thought you have had something similar before like from Noah(Well I prefer calling it MODERN DND), or was it later?  and I award Jacob for choosing the most boring character ever
I've never played d&d, but this is awesome!
Wait, you had a character named Mark (possibly Marc) Thompson and you didn't make him look like Casey Jones?
1:14 is vox machana
3:15 has draconic spelling
NO CLERICS?!?!
15:26  why do i genuinely fell bad??
All the characters roles:  Sue: Mage  Paul: Warrior  Tholemeu: Supporter
This is the boss battle arena
1:21 tholomew is my husband (not the actual guy who’s playing as him I mean the character)
4:33 GEORGE WASHINGTON WE ARE OUTGUNNED OUTMANNED-
Haha I’m half dragon so People hate me
DEPRESSION!!
Iam gessing the classe fore cherter I think pall is a fighter and or barberan Barthalamew bard Zute i think is a sorsarer How close was i
15:58 bro rolled a negative one
I LOVE PAUL
15:25 MY GUM FELL OUT OF MY MOUTH THAT WAS SO FUNNY
1:15 Vox Machina?
was that the horse from adventure time  at 9:51?
4:14 is that fuecoco
Btw luv ur Pokémon vids
I'm so in love with this it's like the pilot to a tv show I'd be super down to watch
9:52 the horse had it coming.
🖐️😑🖐️
Can you make more dnd adventures videos pls ❤❤❤
MAHK TOMPSON😂🤙🏼 it’s a joke from hawaii 4:00
Watching this video for the second time now, I noticed the Vox Machina characters in the opening scene in the Inn. That's a fun easter egg.
R.I.P. old oak inn
“Would you still let me be your manager even if I was a” *turns into worm* ICONIC.
depression
Well is crazy steal the moon
The fact that this video is 2 years old is insane, i still remember when i would constantly watch this video because it had my favorite content creators playing my favorite game :)
Oh Larry, you need to come back to the elite four😂😂😂😂😂
when Paul gets zapped into a zebra 5:23 at the end of the zap you can hear a diarrhea sound
NAH VILLEN ARC AND I WISH I WAS 2:08
Bro dnd is the craziest thing. I in one session ate at least three enemies, gained a pirate ship I somehow kept on my person and dragged a dragon as a level three warlock
15:20 made me laugh so much, I loved it plz do another maybe part two
15:29 PEAK😂
Casting depression is wild
Do more of this please
Like if u think Paul is goated!
Onetime in dnd I tried throwing a rock at a goblin and proceeded to get beaten with a bat by a goblin
i love this so much!! i love D&D and my favorite youtuber is playing it!!!!!! im sorry im so late to watch this :( please post more D&D !!!
Is that the horse from adventure Time 10:08
U look like suzie from deltarune 1:30
ITS SHREK 0:33
So I know this video is 2 years old but the door at 5:14 just made me have to put this out when he said Z to A like the game Pokémon legends ZA
I played a Pokémon DnD campaign and our first session had us fighting an articuno
WORLDS SMALLEST VIOLIN
That was actually so entertaining
On the matter of eating clay, as one seasoned in D&D, I can confirm that my character tends to analyse any new material by putting it in their mouth, as well as eating all manner of things, including, in one campaign, a warforged minotaur character drank a crucible of molten titanium.  It's not really D&D without at least one party member eating something that isn't food.
This is great😂
So Paul is just Nanami
Greg👍
FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THE GODS OUT THERE I NEED A PART TWO
15:30
1:12 Vox Machina!
co o l
Ella is dat u?
Why Is The Dedede Theme So Popular On Your Channel?
Make more videos like this lol 😂   Point blank acid blast for the win 🥇 😅
2😊❤
I love your pokemon videos, but this one is truly my favorite. I hope you've played more since!
WHERE WAS THE DANM DRAGONS
“Beer gut” 13:55
i very much enjoyed the mario and luigi soundtrack in this video
i will never be a part of a group that prominently features anything sexual.  it's an adventure game not a dating simulator.
Ngl i never played dungeons and dragons....but i REALLY want to now
Beep beep I’m a sheep
this video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
I think when i playe dnd im gona do the slimocopaledse
"im luap  nah ur lap"
I'm watching it while drawing my DnD character
i want to play but i a kid
This is actually the first time that Jaiden put sound affects in her video.😮
Vox machina reference
What’s the music at 3:20? Wild Arms? Warning this is my dad. warning This is my dad.
Can we all talk about how legendary this line is? “So Paul so long gay bowers the sheep” 😂
The Mario music made this perfect 👌 lol
Ooh. I really like this clay pedestal idea.
WTF
D	E	P	R	E	S	S	I	O	N
15:38 Paul :wtf Cat &green guy :🤣🤣
13:56 bonk
Once upon a time A legend was whispered in the old oak inn It was a legend of plot twists and clay Of luck and randomness This is the legend of Dungeons and dragons For millenia, employees and manager have lived in balance Bringing peace to the stock market But if hyperinflation were to happen Something bad would probably happen The red thingy from the stock market will plummet down And the prices of stuff will rise Then, their wallets already empty The employees will be underpaid even more Only then, shining with hope 3 random races appear in the old oak inn An underpaid replacement manager A Susie knockoff And a reincarnation of Michael Jackson Only the can defeat the employer and main manager And restore the sheep's original form Only then will the wand be destroyed And the hyperinflation stopped  from spreading Today, the all powerful magic wand Lies behind a riddle Very edible looking clay And a tribe of goblins consisting of gob, glob, gobble, gobble gob and t h e p e e l e r But recently, something in the atmosphere of the world seems to shift...
Tabbaxi monk, and then use the power of terminal velocity
16:59 Why does Paul is skin-colored and Paul Jr has white skin?
I love d d
Vecna:i have decended to the entitys realm (dead by daylight)
That was so cool😂
Tiamat more like Bug
How many times has Larry traveled to a alternate universe
8:08 Does anyone know what that song is? Or the name of it? It's also used in James' minecraft End video and I have been wanting to find it.
I literally predicted this moment 15:27
Is there ever going to be a part 2?
Song name? 16:32
I want this serene more🫠🫠
I think it's absolutely hilarious Jaiden's brain went to pepper spray instead of an actual mace. For those unaware, a mace is the spiky ball on a stick. Bam bash, not psssshhhh.
6:56 turtle
Yo en tales of xadia :]
what the actual fuck is this masterpiece?
0:57  he looks like Larry from Pokemon violet
I always wanted okay game like this bue I don't have how D:
I luv ur vids jaden❤
4:15 was that the beast from over the garden wall?
Why does Paul look like Larry from pokemon Violet and Scarlet
13:36 what’s that face on thalemu (is that how you spell it?)
I love the little nod to critical roll with Keyleth, Vex, Grog, and Pike at the start.
i started mid session, since then, i fished a fish who i now keep in my bag, kidnapped a few kobolds with beef jerky, convinced them they were all named george, i abused a bookshelf, annoyed a great dragon, got vaporized, reincarnated with my team, went on a boat, fished a seagull sized dragon out of the air, bound it in rope and used it as a flamethower
What happend to the turtle
Really hope you do more of these! Love them.
I LOVE D&D :3
Why does Jaden's character remind me of Susie from Deltarune
I’m now addicted
2 OF MY FAV YTERS COLLAB? LET’S GOOO
Anyone know what the song at the end was called?
9:53 the horse
I’m in a dnd group in my school it’s not an official club yet but it’s SO CHAOTIC but so fun lol

This was truly EPIC!
As SOOON as i saw Paul, i was like LARRY! DATS LARRY! I love how Jacob wanted not to be an unrealistic fiction character, but a Larry, a businessman.
Paul is basically a blonde Larry from paldea
VOX MACHINA REFERENCE ❤
I need more of this Please!

1:26 jaiden’s character looks like susie from deltarune and NO ONE is changing my mind
1:16 It took six watch throughs to notice half of Vox Machina sitting in the Old Oak Inn..!
11:10 yknow clerics have speak with animals, and so do mages? JAYDEN. RANBOO. BOTH OF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE GOBLINS.
9:10 ash baby reference? ( IM SORRY SOMEONE HAD TO SAY IT)
Slapstick, friendship, adventure, and turtles. Truly the Finest Fantasy
1:16 Vox Machina

There’s one time I play D&D and my friend cast smoke bomb which my friend got 20 on so the enemy got lung cancer and the one that cast the spell escaped when the secret boss come and if you want to know the two left in game are both healer
DUND!!!!
16:54 THAT WAS MY SAME REACTION

I’m in the thick of it
VOX MACHINA REFRENCE??.
I love the windwaker background music, best memories of my childhood
YAY DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS THE GAME I STARTED LEARNING WHEN I WAS 2!!!!
How does this game work
This is possibly the most dndy dnd game
I like your characters they look cool. :3
My question is did you guys keep playing?
No Goblegloop? And your animation of your D&D adventure was stupendously marvelous.
I need more DnD from Jaiden
Pls! I need more! This needs to be a series!♥️♥️♥️
Epicccc
Paul look like Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet
yaaaass u mentioned vox machina !!!!!
15:29 pfft that is exactly what i expected
tell me why for the first riddle I  blanked and said zoowee mama
1:16 it took me a second to realize it was the whole group because I was like “that’s keyleth, I’d know keyleth anywhere, no way that’s not keyleth” before finally spotting vex and then realizing Pike and grog were there too.
one word looooore
"Casting disguise self to visually turning themselves into Mark's ex wife," Oh no, I remembered what happens next.
Me and my dad play this all the time
14:08 DEPRESSION
Do moreeee
15:38  had me rolling around
Paul acting like him becoming a zebra was regular
I LOVE DNDDDD
Not the king DDD theme😂😂😂
i recently started highschool and joined a dnd club, and i made a new friend in one of my classes and they were telling me abt their dnd character. he (character) was a cat, like puss n boots, but what was funny is they said it was because he had a bad hookup with a witch 😭❤️
I did a one shot that was very similar so I think my dm took some inspo
Sorry, I can't play that, I'm an alcoholic 😭
Ignoring that Alpharad was Blonde Larry
This video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome :)
Does anyone know what the music in 8:10 - 9:26 is? It’s driving me crazy!
WAIT THAT IS JUST SUSIE DELTARUNE, no wonder she plays her so well in Alpharad's DR Multiplayer vids
WHAT ABOUT THE TIME LOOP!?
I always thought Jaiden's character looked like Susie and now Jaiden voiced Susie in multiplayer deltarune it came full circle
You’re the reason I wanna play
Pul remindes me of lary
1:23 endercat
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
My half goblin/elf character told a goblin in my parties way to unalive itself and I rolled so high the dm let it slide lol it was great
Mark from Walmart.
4:33 all hail bong water?
I’m surprised I hadn’t subbed before now, I am on a different account, which I used to only be able to  use
Jaiden, you NEED to do this again, same people
0:31 that probably is the most generic DND story I ever heard, which shows how crazy and fun this game is
This one time I played dnd my friend kept getting hurt like sombody used them as a skateboard and I flung a troll at them I rolled and I got a high number so I hit them hard.and before that I saved everybody just some context before I say this I was a dragon thhat wanted to be a witch but was failingand so yah um anyways my group and I walk down into a cave  and i forbot how but one of my friend who was a troll (they're a player) got hurt it wasnt the same player that kept getting hurt so I took the liberty of putting them in my sack to carry them through out the adventure anyway afterwardsa pack of EVIL MUSHROOMS that were hurting us I kinda forgor anyways I saved the day bcuz this was my chance I could use my my magic to help me as Itake it out I used all my might and hit the heck out of the mushrooms and I actually kill them yay I saved everyone.then it turns out that the charecter who kept getting hurt afterward has a heal potion or somthing and could have saved the troll in my bag  but it was tolate in real life the two players start bickering as the rest of the group and I are laugthing our butts off.😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂
“ITS WORMIN’ TIME!”
Dungeons and diddy
I like that they referenced Larry from paldia
:31 actually I managed to by pass a whole ass boss fight vai history checks. My character was a noble of the kingdom the setting was in, and the boss was an undead, but still able to be reasoned with, prior king of the kingdom. bit of talking the situation down later, we accomplished our goal in the dungeon and dipped. also left a rivial party of NPCs to get very likely horribly murdered by the undead there, since they where the reason the undead were awake and upset to begin with, but eh. shoulda tried actually solving the puzzles instead of brute forcing everything -.-  also in the dungeon, there was a rocket powered elevator it took us an hour to figure out wasn't a trap meant to maybe kill us and instead was just a neat thing the DM made up cause it sounded cool ....
Oh I love D&D!! :3 I spend like 10 hours  in a day playing it🥹✨️ Favorite game eveerrr!!!!😃😍
Oh I love D&D!! :3 I spend like 10 hours  in a day playing it🥹✨️ Favorite game eveerrr!!!!😃😍
Indian dear one I can’t remember one campaign it was like a merit of set up ceremony thing you got it in this random girl just give me an 05, so I just threw a knife fatter than she was I hack, and we were meant to figure that out, but I figured it out with violence yippie😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thalamew My Favorite Character Being Mind Controlled By A Crown & Being Stuck for 3 Years In The Same day Makes It Hard To Believe
jaidens character is so corny im sorry but c'mon elfs are better
“I’m a RIDDLE DOOR”
im now in 7th grade and now allowed to play D&D with my friends YAY!! in school!!
I  adopted a noble family by small talk
Alpharad or Jacob is just Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet
where is the video with the actual footage?? :P
New from the start the sheep was Paul
please So
i just realized that alpha rads character is just larry
I, a gnome, got called a midget by a enemy. We beat him to a pulp and while he was running away my fellow party member blew his brains out from the sky. We went back to camp and I ate him. Never call me a midget.
14:23 "Everything that's about to happen [is] genuinely the craziest [#!&%]ing [$#!%] I've ever seen a D&D player do, man." -Charlie 'Charlie Slimecicle' Slimecicle
love that they ate the clay, my first dnd experience myself and the rest of the group, all newbies, ate a dusty eye
12:48 look just to the left of luap on the bottom of the screen
8:21 my favorite line was when the worm said “it’s worming time” and started worming everywhere
2 adventure time references the horse being cooked and the first two goblin names
"DEPRESSION" as a command is insane ToT
I find it interesting how she didn't talk about the experience but instead told what happened in the game like a story
so strange that suzie deltarune was just hanging out at the bar
i love this video even a year on XD id love to see more from the dnd's if any of you play some ^^
BONGO CAT REFERENCEEEE
1:37  Gives the same vibes as the yoshikage kira speech
Yep...ill never be able to play d&d...
Whenever I rewatch this video for some reason I see Jaiden character as just alternate color Susie from Deltarune
This feels like my experience of playing D&D with my family with my dad as the dungeon master, also, top tier animation👍.
12:33 Susie’s Idea
can you do this again?
THIS IS PEAK
I dare you to play against James (the odd one is out) plz plz plz 😭😭😭😭
I will never forget my first D&D game when my first wild surge rolled an 8, the DM had me re-roll as it was my first game and my characters introduction to the party in a small tavern the next roll was a 7... I ended their campaign in under 15 minutes... they didn't invite me back...
Your character is literally Susie from Deltarune 🥺💕
What about the turtle🐢
Guys Jaiden, Ranboo and Alpharad’s characters are literally just Kris, Susie and Ralsei from Deltarune, this is literally just Deltarune
Just realized the Vox machina reference at the beginning
MARK THOMPSON?!
Alpharad is literally Larry from Pokemon
4:55 thats a very charlie thing to say
Wait... clay can be reduced to ash?
so cool
13:55 Rock solid beer gut is crazy 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's hard to believe that ye olden "the lost child actually is the animal that accompanied the heroes" is still a good introduction for first timers. :D
1:43 is that a reference to Larry from Pokemon scarlet and violet?
You should make more videos like this I love watching them
Cant wait for the second part
I LOVE DANDD
I LOVE THIS GAME I WAS GOING TO PUT DAD BUT THAT SAYS DAD
I thought luap was twin brother
Bro jaden became Susie if she was a dragonborn instead of a dinosaur
"born and raised!" *"i wish i was."* I CANT BRO, WTF 😭
1:16 VOX FREAKING MACHINA HELL YES I LOVE THIS SERIES!
I'd watch the show but not read the book :/ but I loved this :D
1:15 love the vox machina cameos!
"IT'S WORMIN' TIME!" had me cackling XD
I PLAYED THIS EXACT CAMPAIGN WITH MY FRIENDS (except we got stuck on 2 side quests, one with fairies and one with a portal to another world, and instead of turtles we got squirrels)
I've been watching your videos for a while. The little silly stories always make me so happy, even when I'm upset
Poor goblins :(
this was awsome video, could you make more videos on dungens and dragons?
2:24 shout out to dragon jaiden
Really didn't expect vox machina
0:32 ahhh very interesting....*i say as I follow you*
Awesome 😎
I thought it was sowing needle😂
Fun
I love D&D
But at the end, what happened to the time loop? Did it fix itself? It didn't, and that D&D session just kept repeating itself?   I guess we'll never know.
I think we would be friends
I loved how chaotic this was, D&D is magic
jaidens charecter may or may not be inspired by susie from deltarune but she probaly made it completly original
My D&D game:I hire a fucking sentient god,and also the PKMN trainer Red,and they MURDER EVERYONE ELSE.
I love how you just entirely ignored the devil part lol😂
I watched this a few times and for some reason i didn't notice. Jacob is blonde larry. Larry is an adventurer, elite four in hoenn from  pkm to many types, elite four in paldea and a gym leader in paldea. 4 jobs. Larry or Paul. You probably live alone. WHAT DO YOU NEED 4 JOBS FOR???
I love dnd so thank u for showing more people this game it really helps get more people into the hobby so thank u
Why do you look like Suzie
6:56 If the door had the power to transform Paul back, why couldn't it transform Luap back? Because it was a different magic?
I love how Larry form pokemon is in this and works at walmart
Paul is very like larry from pokemon
You are a naturally gifted storyteller.
I never had a cooperation for d&d but I saw this video and watched only 10 mins I’m already attached to it GOD BARTHOLAMUW (srry if I spelt it wrong) HE IS SO CUTE!!!!!!
That horse with purple is from adventure time
DND
this was so awesome thanks getting me into D&D
Vox machina reference
you can definitely tell charlie was the dungeon master this is so charlie coded
Make more
Make more
I played one time with my friend and his mom and I was a lynx that could summon weather storms and had a move that could instantly kill small enemies and give others within a fifty mile radius diabetes but I had to roll a nat 20 to use it lol
Larry what are you doing here did your gym get closed?
This is so good 😭
thats actually a good story 😍
0:37 Oh yeah, I forgot to subscri-
I made a imagination game cuz this game
I’m sorry but the frame at 9:13 of the worm disintegrating took me tf out 😭
You should do more of these
I find it funny that Vox Machina can be seen in the first seconds of the video, I think that is a nice detail.
Took me a while to realize that Jacob’s character was just Larry from Pokémon scarlet/violet
10:12 Adventure time referens
9:04 was a invincibile referiment
3:38 I used to be human, until I took an arrow to the knee
Loved this! But how many nat 1s did you giys roll?!? 😂. Loved the kitty bard in particular not sure why
ABSOLUTE CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE
I love how Jacob’s character is a raging alcoholic
Give them a gosh darn grammy!!!
i like how i immediately guessed what animal jaiden would be😂
Luap
Are we ignoring the fact at the start they siad"I used my charismatic skill to seduce him and then-"
I unsubed jst to sub again
jaiden is heartless lol (don't mean that in a rude way)
Oh my first DND adventure, there was a giant gate. I was the only one in my entire group that didn’t try going over it instead I inspected the gate and turned out. It was unlocked the whole time. like someone got stuck, someone else tried to freeze the person that got stuck someone tried to eat the gate since they eat metal we got stuck but when I found it was unlocked it was a hilarious scene because I was the only one that tried opening it and on my second one we had a adventure, but I tried killing the sheep multiple times but kept getting defeated because I kept rolling a low number
1:42 ALPHARAD HOWD YOU EVEN MAKE UP THAT *TRAGIC* STORY-
"Yeah, he does that sometimes." WHAT DO YOU MEAN?💔
Wait I just realised but are those the characters from Vox machina in the tavern scene?? 1:15
2:29  Player casually telling the DM what to roll
I’m currently doing D&D. I LOVE IT SOO MUCH! At first I was confused but now I understand it! Our mission was to save a city that was taken up into the sky. Make deals with ogres, save unicorns, and stuff.
So sad that literally all the people I know are don't know what is dnd because in russia (I'm Russian) people are not playing dnd
Man I wish my games were like this   *Rereads sentance*   They are actually
Hey i was a dragon burn before
Can u make more content of this
I just started it is incredible🎉!
THE VOX MACHINA REFRENCE
I can t stop smiling watching this
Idk if anyone else saw it but I saw the horse from adventure time
We need more DnD vids, WHO'S WITH ME?!
12:19  ❤️Susie’s Idea
i just realised there was a Vox Machina reference at 1:15 😭🙏
Gang we were so close to a bizlychannel colab
I never realize it until now but there's a Vox Machina reference at the very beginning 1:16
Turtle final answer" got me
Make a part two I want you to do more DND
Nice little critical role animation at the beginning, seems accurate to their lore ahha
0:18  Already know that the DM was so fricking mad at that
bard tholomew? really?  Luap being reversed Paul?? IT'S WORMING TIME???  make more campaignes please
Please do more!!
4:53 bongo cat
1:15 VOX MACHINA
I did not expect to see Vox machina at the start lmao i spilled my drink
pauls a ranger??
Thank you Jaden for this video your character inspired me to make my own and yesterday I played dnd for the first time it was awesome thank you  Update: i am now addicted to dnd
Pleeeaeaeaeaeaeaesss make more dnd content!! Half of the Views on this video are from meeeeeeeeeee! I ❤ DND and your Artstyle makes it so much more beautiful!!!!‘
It so random 😂
Where jadens bird?
I love d&d!
I am a DM over here! If you want to play D&D try very hard not to be me! (DMing will give you sczhophreinia)
9:53 hey look it’s a horse suit from adventure time
What happened to the turtle
1:13 vox machina reference!!!!
THIS IS SO FUNNY OH MY GOD 😭🤣
I love this story lmao. I play dnd and I always base my character off of Yuri from ddlc , but my party can be so boring ! I loved the betrayal scene with disguise self lmfao
Turns from wholesome to hilarious  in 30 seconds.
Never played D&D before, but thought this video was a blast.
my dnd dm let me have a ar 15 and a "few" grenades (the first enemy i saw got turned into ash)
6:53 *Grunt, *Grunt Turtle, that's the funniest part, another great video, thanks Jaiden (:
I think you should play Minecraft
Just realized the goblins are eating the horse from adventure time
This was an amazing piece of cinema.  I hope this becomes a series. A lot of big names have tried adapting DnD to animation but you did it the best by far.
8:22 ITS WORMIN TIME!
Saw the thumbnail, so that one person and thought: “RANBOO??????” Clicked vid, got my response. It was indeed Ranboo, lol. 😂🎉
What happened to turtle paul jr 😔
Ranboooooooo
Jacob is just Larry from Pokémon
I know I’m late, but I really loved all the superstar saga music you had in this one.
I love DND this is definintely 100% accurate to it
“And we ended up eloping together” got me 😂
My first time with dungeons & dragons: Everybody was really bad at climbing trees, we all landed a lot of times in mud and we nearly lost our tank in the first fight. It was against 3 little fairys. ... It was funny as shit.
PLS PLAY MORE D&D AND ANIMATE IT I HAVE WATCHED THIS VIDEO SO MANY TIMES ITS SO FUNNY
the bit worked, I subcribed. :)
Paul is Larry from Pokemon violet
VOX MACHINA!!! 1:17
BRO, REWIND 1:15, VOX MACHINA IS JUST VIBING?!
9:51 is that the unicorn from Adventure Time??????????? 🦄
Being a Sesoned dnd player seducing a ogre is cool 😎
Jacob made his character after Larry from Pokemon scarlet and violet
I play it with my brother
YAY MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER AND MY FAVORITE GAME :D  Edit: 1:15 HEY HEY THOSE ARE THE VOX MACHINA CHARACTERS!!!!!!!!! My life is complete <3
i love the Vox Machina cameo
Your Littery suizie from delta rune just more alligator then dino
THE END ACTUALLY GOES CRAZY WTF???
Random deppressed man,furry,and a dragon.Dream friend group.
luaP = Paul
make this a movie😭
My first dnd game is tmr Im so excited bc I want them to do things like “I seduce the orc with my natural charisma and French accent” and then roll a nat 1 Which then I’m able to say “He drop kicks you into the wall.”
PLEASE MOREEEE PLEASEEEEE    I will even roll a charisma check
Larry alpharad lol
0:27 THEY ELOPED TO MEXICO GNG TRUST
Yo once I had legit saved our whole campaign….    STORY ON MY DEVIANTART   @UltraPlasmaDragon
1:24 FUS RO DA
Dancing sheep
I once hit a nat 20 and transformed the monster our DM had been building the entire campaign to into a goldfish. He was so mad he goes "ITS AN IMMORTAL GOLDFISH, WITH THE SAME NUMBER OF HIT POINTS" so we chopped the goldfish into a bunch of little pieces and threw it into a nearby volcano
The horse from adventure time
when i played there was a toilet and asomeone sat on it and something ate his but.idk what it was. this was like 6 yrs ago
In a D&D game, I made out with a cult leader and he died of embarrassment and I became the leader of the cult.😂🐉
i  was dying at  15:23
I neeeed to see more dnd contenttt 😭😭😭
8:00 man i really wish i could sculpt something here... because it would be hilarious. (im a man. you know what im talking about.)
I saw a DND add while watching this
IS THAT LARRY FROM POKÉMON!!! Nah that’s just Paul
"ye old mart of wal" 😂😂 (walmart)
Paul, assistant manager of the ye old mart of wall
9:52 the horse is adventure time
The Clay worm saying “ITS WORMIN TIME!” Then explodes 2 seconds later is genuinely the funniest part in my opinion.
Sea of stars music. Love it.
WHERE IS SCANLAN, MAN?!?!
😀
EXACTLY MY REACTION 15:34
now u made want to try D&D too
I know how to get the world record for the fastest d&d game just imagine the games ending
I’ve never played dungeons and dragons but a friend told me a story once where they met a little girl and she was telling them about something and one of his party members said “I cast fireball” and got a nat 20💀
I love dnd
1:32 Larry from pokemon
Hey I did this to.
Nice vox machina cameo
guys I just noticed that when the goblins were cooking the horse it looks like the same one from adventure when Ice king was spying on Finn and Jake
14:07 Something similar to this happened during a dnd session I was Dming last night where the players were fighting two Norkers and one of the players started shouting Yo Mama jokes so hard that it dealt 3 damage to one of the Norkers
8:16 *I T S W O R M I N G T I M E*
9:50 is that the weird horse from adventure time?
i recently got into dnd and really like your videos! im a beginner so i dont know much…i do, however suspect that. tmu (thats what the subtitles called him…) is a bard and zoot (ALSO THE SHBTITLES IM DEAF) is a sorcerer…probably??? what are the classes??? also did yall use alignments? :D
I am tree :D
I hope you make another one
Why you so cute man why you so cute
Just returned to this video trying to pause another video.
Make-believe for adults who can sorta do math
d&d is so fun (I say, having completely derailed the campaign seven different times by being a kind and understanding friend to the main npc who is often having a mental breakdown and trying to kill the whole party)
Imagine an animated campaign for this.
The crown saying T 🕊🕊🕊
1:15  OMG VOX MACHINA I LOVE IT
WE nead more D&D!
Being in an Inn with the members of Vox Machina would be an experience in itself... ( 1:15 )
Anyone noticed that when they were in the cave with the goblins the sheep that was being cooked was the same sheep or sheep costume that ice king war in adventure time😅
Xmz
I really want to play dnd too  but i sadly don't know how and can't rn
Dungeons & dragons with Jaiden animations
the lore goes wild😭😭😭😭
I think I would like it, I know people who play it, I’ve asked them about playing it and I still haven’t played it.
As someone whose DnD character is a tortle, i loved Paul jr.
Why had nobody mentioned the critical role reference at the literal very beggining
4:33 the turtles names rotating through (most) of the names Greg from Over The Garden Wall names his frog is peak
Is alfarad larry 😂😂
I lovezDND its the best GAME
If the axe is spilt in half, can’t he duel wield it? Also we need part two
1:38 bro is pondering about life
Oohhh this was a treat go behold!   You should totally try blood on the clocktower if you get a chance!
Is no one going to talk abt how similar Jaden’s character is to Suzy from Deltarune in apernce
Next time play  spore
The way the work died if you know to meme you know
10:14 Gobble Gob is such a tuff name 🗣️🗣️🗣️
The “riddle door” looks like he’s from Duck Tales and I love it
Do this with magic the Noah he makes the craziest dnd
It's funny that I instead hear the dialogue in the person's actual voice, and not Jaiden replicating them, everytime she talks for Jacob or Ran, I hear Jacob and Ran instead
My two favorite things ever Jaden and dnd
that was very fun
So paul so long gay bowserz" got me 12:37
I SAW THE VOX MACHINA REFRENCE OMG I LOVE THAT SHOW TOO
12:37 SO LONG GAY BOWSER
On my first DND game, I once one punched a whole dungeon 😂
The way this aged so Wrong
With me, everyone kept dating all the other charecters
Why does Jaiden’s character look like Susie from delta rune
Hi Jaiden
The end battle was epic and the music went HARD
Ngl, I *love* the concept of D&D, but I don't think I could ever acc get into it bcos of roleplaying aspect. I love seeing movies & games that are based in the world of D&D tho (& fantasy worlds in general).
I neeeeedddd moreeeeee
15:51 WORK AT A PIZZA PLACE REF?????
During mt first game we were trying to turn a wizard back into a human because his assistant had turned him into a sheep  and we even defeated a dragon made out of a bed but after all that my friend got a bad rool and melted the sheep.
0:44  aka funny man
I remember overhearing my brothers’ dnd campaign where they stole stuff to pay for papa John’s pizza and used a HOT dog to melt a lock into a bucket, my brother played a red dead redemption character and my brother’s friend played Batman
Guys I just realised that jaiden 's character is very similar to susie in deltarune
16:51....WAIT PAUL KILLED HIS SON!!
my favorite line of this is "I'm very detail-oriented"
Charlie is one of the best DMs I’ve ever seen.
Very cool
BONGO CAT
Larry reference 2:03 😊
I love dungens and dragons ❤
I
I wanna play toooo! smone get me a DM 😭😭😭😭
noice campian
NOW I WANNA PLAY DND 😭😭

If u think about it in reality it’s Ranboo who is the villan
6:47
9:51 I know that horse.
PLEASE I BEG YOU TO MAKE MORE DND ADVENTURE ANIMATIONS
i'm actually playing the exact same campaign in this video wtm 😭
Can we talk about how their party is literally just the delta warriors
Part two owo
Next time, play Vampire the Masquerade   I swear, every time someone outright tries to make it serious it somehow loops back into a What We Do In The Shadows kinda plotline.
I actually found this adventure on dungeon master’s guild
1:45 the inspiration of Larry the normal type gym from Pokémon
She did mark dirty 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why does Paul look likes Larry from pokemon
Theory: Jaiden just wanted to animate some fantasy backgrounds
was the T on ranboos crown a ref to something?
What is it with worms here? I don’t understand.
I like how you took reference to Vox Machina at the start 1:15
This really is amazing I have only played D and D once but it was so amazing I played with my friends! REally great work!
9:12 : WHYYYYY
1:01 da story
Part 2 pls
do more
I love Paul Sr. I just find him so funny
I love turtles
I love dnd and this inspired me to play it
I Just recently played my first time to.
BRUH. THE MYSTERIOUS SHEEP FROM ADVENTURE TIME 9:44
Honestly I think Jaiden is the person that every dm hopes and fears too get in their party
I CAST DEPRESSION!
You were the cat, right?
Bro I heard a fart sound effect 😂 5:25
I’ve never played dnd but how does the rules work?
Your a dragon born acid too!
I LOVE THESE
was that the beast from over the garden wall??? .-.
I meant what
I love dungeons and dragons
You know hat creature i made myself shadow born
I JUST NOW REALIZED YOU PUT VOX MACHINA IN THERE.. Such taste you have, I love this.
Seeing that the villain is designed like a Walmart manager makes this kinda weird for me since I actually work at Walmart and watched this during my lunch break. Good video though. 👍
Kiki, Pike, Grog and Vex, oh Critical Role, you are so loved!!!
16:57 I KNEW IT !!!
It's larry
Paul looks like Larry from Pokémon😂
I killed our door equivalent and 50 others by dropping a giant disco ball on them (our entire game is homebrew)
For my next session I am going to poison the water supply ☠️
No way bro became Larry from pokemon
I LOVE D&D my dad mykes the sesions and he alowed me to be a dragon
RAHHHH I LOVE DND
IM ALSO A DRAGONBORN YESSIR
I KNEW IT WAS WORM
Vox Machina spotted 🫶
15:58 thats great 😂
4:16 THE BEAST FROM OVER THE GARDEN WALL??!?
Jaiden should play clash royale
One of the names for the turtle being Bong Water kills me LOL
This part drove me crazy 😂😂😂4:56
Is that vox machina 1:16 ???
Pov my brain in the middle of class:
BRUTAL MUCH?! (nevertheless this was pretty good)
Yeah,.... this sounds exactly like a dnd session xD
What happened to the turtle?
I'm the only one that thinks Jaiden's Character is like very similar to Susie From Deltarune?.
I could help!
NOT THE VOX MACHINA!!!!!!!!!!!
Are you going to do dnd again
We are those Vox Machina you added Vox mocking as your video from the show on prime video the legend of Vox Machina great reference Jaden
me and my dad made a simular game but its on paper and it has to much more to it rather than just imagining it amd rolling da dice
when the cat used the spell on mark, it would be funny if he said AVADA KEDAVRA!!
One time my party was fighting TWO black dragons and we have this base that we use to camp out in and basically is a nuclear bomb if thrown at someone. There was a cloud of darkness over the dragon and a certain area and one of our players who's name is LeRoy threw the building at the dragon, but he was in the in the darkness and couldn't see. The DM rolled a dice for targets, and I was 4. The DM rolled a four. I got crushed by a building.
This is super funny, pls more of that❤😂😂
My husband can & have play Baldur’s Gate 3 all day & night long.
10:53 ITS THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME
*Spoilers Blocker*                                      luap=Paul. That's it.
“Ye old Mart of Wal”
The acid blast at the end, got me dying
I for one thought it was turtle. Go Paul JR!
3:20 Jaiden’s dice luck:
In one of the campaigns ive played, I got a pet seal that got so good rolls constantly he became a god. Praise butters the seal
Nice animation
part 22222222222222222
Ive always wanted to get into it but i don got any friends that wanna play D&D w me 😞
I can only imagine how bad their dice luck was with so many failed attempts to do stuff😭
Thus was so completely random that I couldn't stop laughing at every unexpected turn. A true masterpiece of nonsensical whimsy.🤣
“Let me play the world’s saddest song on the world’s smallest violin”
Do if my first campaign rn
“Started casual conversation”
Why is Jacob Larry from pokemon?
I’ve never played it either but it seems cool
2:26 this has to be a twelve minutes reference
9:50 NOT THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE :(
rewatching this yet again and i realized you also called the cat a they. why the hek did - oh, right, males are normally only 1 color...
I dare you to only use monsters from Eggslinger to kill the prison boss
I really like the fact that Jaden uses the character from the animated file ‘Vox machina’ at 1:15
13:12 Wait, I'm confused: Was Tholomew actually lying about being in a time loop?
YOOOO I KNEW ABOUT SLIMECICLE FROM NOAH THE MAGIC AHHH I DIDNT KNOW HE WAS YOUR FRIEND (Awesome video btw ❤)
5:07 legendsZA
2:11  this is giving me dream SMP vibes
Larry from Pokemon is that you
I love dungeons and dragons
Can someone give me the name of the music used at the end ?
I love how Jaiden actually animated her character as a black Dragonborn, which does indeed have an acid breath weapon. Good job being lore accurate, Jaiden!!!!! <3
I LOVE DND
3:15 OMG! She actually spelled out "Speak with animals" in draconic script! That's so cool!!
BRO THIS VIDEO WAS AWESOME PLEASE MAKE MORE LIKE THIS IM BEGGING😭😭😭
Man i just love RPG but i got no one tto play but one day one day i will play Mark my words
legendary trio. (Players)
4:14 IS THAT THE BEAST FROM OVER THE GARDEN WALL????
can you please make  how to draw your cute figures like the cat in this vid!! i luv ur vids btw
Every D&D player and DM’s dream to have their campaign animated into a show.
1:13 HOW DID I NEVER NOTICE THE VOX MACHINA CHARACTERS HERE
10:04 IS THAT AN ADVENTURE TIME REFERENCE???
9:13 I know this emoticon
Favorite part is ranboo stuck with the whole "existential horrror" stuff he got from generation loss for his character
Funniest jaiden vid ever
1:15  VOX MACHINA
Ari and fuecoco? : / 4:14
Its ok if you tell us to sub
BRO I PLAY DND
One time I was fighting this giant tree, and I tried to throw my spirit at it, and I threw it so high it went over the wall of the stadium and hit the popcorn seller😂😂😂😂😂 😅😅😅😅😅😅😮😮😮😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊
8:37
I love the undertale part I'm a big fan of undertale
As an artificer, I CAST GUN!
We Need more Videos Like that.
15:32 I had the same reaction haha
How do you start a DND thing? I’ve tried dinner with my friends but never gets anywhere
And also slime guy
Wait is that actually ranboo?
If i was in D&D i might also use acid breath like zoot/jaden
The fact that Paul actually has lore is surprising.
“DEPRESSION!”
It would bee amazing if when the Shep became human agian and it would be pchal😂
A dragonborn tabaxin and human
9:53 yo I recognize that horse.
I am a DM and one time a person in my campaign got pregnant twice and no they wanted to I gave them a alternate route and they went out of their way to do it.
My character in d&d is a dragonborn and their name is acid flame oh my God I love dragons so I had to choose the dragonborn so I was like yippee
0:57 :/
15:32 alpharad be like: D:<
I love the inclusion of Vox Machina at 1:16 Thought I wouldn’t notice but I did!
I need the hole collection
Acid blast
This part caught me off guard 15:20
This is so accurate
That is so real
The slimy boi as the dm was a amazing idea
wwhats  that?
I have ptsd from the Linx theam song I will never play that game again and I swear that I will find the person who made it and I will make them regret it for the rest of thair life and if they are not living eny more I will dig them up… I’m not crazy I swear 🫠😓🫩
Hola
Mark turnt luap to a sheep
i like how Bartholomew's life was so repetitive that he thought he was in a time loop 😺😺 also: IT'S WORMIN TIME MOTHER F**KERS
Absolutely love how Jaidens narrating makes it so you can listen to this masterpiece as well as watching it.
1:39 bro turned to a combination of Larry and Yoshikage Kira 😂
Oh my god vox machina 1:16
11:15 nahh really you bump into an invisible force you can't see😮😂
The alphabet backwards was a pretty smart answer ngl 😂
Dragon?!
What’s your class?
One time I was watching some friends play dnd but then one of them ate a grenade and they rolled a 20 killing the whole party
I only just now noticed you never asked me to subscribe! I just did it, like, naturally, because I loved your videos! Thank you for not doing that annoying thing before or since this video! Not only does it not increase the chances of me subscribing, but it honestly gives me reverse psychology and makes me become more refusal to it! Also, yay for Zelda music!
I one time met a little thing, his name was clarence :D and i also saw a beholder D:
I see the vocnokena
I have spotted two Over the Garden Wall references. The Beast’s silhouette and the potential names for the turtle
Vox Machina
9:50 i know an adventure time reference when i see one
I really like the characters designs all of them are cute!  Especially Ranboo’s!
0:30 its seems crazy stupid, unsubbed.
1:15 it's a vox machina reference!
0:56
Weird story but I recognized Luap immediately because when I was in elementary school I had a slight crush on a boy named Paul and to be mysterious whenever people asked if I liked anyone I would say Luap 😭😭
I felt emotions until 15:28 😂
Someone more will give congrats on the master for creativity?
SUPER AMAZING. SURPRISINGLY AWESOME STORLINE
1:50 larrrryyyy!!!!!
That's is actually a really funny story and I'm actually starting to play dnd so it's cool to see how it works better and also my favourite part was the point blank acid thing
3:04 Wrong Paul
Did anyone else realize that the crown has a t on it... might be a techno reference :')
Me watching into:"CG6 AND RANBOO HELL 🦅🦅🦅🦅"
Of corse ranboo chose to be tiny
Command word "depression" reminds me of "emphasise" from critical role C2
I hope she does more of this :) I just started DnD, it’s so fun 😁
That was f****ing hilarious.  Gud job
It’s been one year
why does zoot remind me of moon wof
rip ice king, the goblins got him
I love that the vox Machina party is in the tavern at the beginning
What about the death runs people😰😰😰
YOU'VE BEGGED FOR SUBS BEFORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4:16  right there. Is that he BEAST from Over the Garden Wall??
Omg, this was fantastic
One time in my campaign, me and my party were trying to find this magic ring of power to protect the fairy queen or soemthing. But we got there and we couldn't find it so we just saw a fruit. So I ate the fruit! which was a disguised ring, teh ring we spent two sessions fighting for. anyway, since I had the ring inside me, I became the queen's guard/wife.
15:40 Roar of DDD from Kirby and the Forgotten Land is a perfect final boss theme here
Firstly a dragon born is a safe first race in dnd secondly ome adventure i had was ome of my most cool character ok so i was in an arena by myself had mo other players in that campaign ok so rull of cool came in to play there where these guant 20 feet wide worms so i bait ome and cut it in half with ny sword
What the is “DND” wait did I spell that correctly
I honestly thought this would be a Magic the Gathering
3:28 WHY THE 🐑 DID YOU TRY TO SPRAY ME WITH MACE
14:15 im so lonely, all the other managers are scared of me
It happened again. He took half campaign to open a hallway of doors, just normal doors no traps and nothing.
Fun fact I played 3 games 2 with friend and one with family where I had a black elf with bad luck, so I created my oc in dnd who was just too mean, so when we restarted a game with friends I heard that bards had viscous mockery and I made my character, spoilers it was venti, from genshin my friends were 'wtf' and i said "i just want to insult enemies and they die as venti" and fun thing we were all getting each by 10 monkeys (we were 70) so i just said 'dumbass' and rolled a 20 and all monkeys just died
Can someone explain how to play dnd? I really wanna learn it

Damn I always wondered what happened to mark thompson after he left hawai’i😂💀
eating clay is something i haven't tried yet while playing with my dnd gang, thanks for the idea, my dm will probably kill me
13:41 Obito reference
In my d and d games I have a pet bird named marshmallow and they are a mix of tofu and ari

oh shit, wild sheep chase! not my favorite oneshot, but definitely a very good starter one
I ship tholamew and Paul
What was everyone class?
Just played my first one-shot, not D&D but a Swedish RPG called dragonbane! It was super fun, here's a little story:  So I was a wokfkin fighter, my brother was an elf ranger, and another guy(we didn't know him) was a human mage. We were going to a tomb with a broken seal, where we saw the ghost of the queen that was buried there. My brother then proceeded to flirt with her.(we called the queen his gf after that)
THERE IS ONLY 2 DNIMATE
0:23 was💀
Please do another dnd session jayden! I love how you animated this one shot it still makes my day!
I once played a 14 year old shapeshifter with a pillowcase of doorknobs as my weapon. Safe to say, its an interesting experience.
A woman..playing d and d the legends are true!
My character is a Dragonborn paladin fun fact
Ha I was a tiny cat and I could knock out the door window. Also, my party could yippee.
I need to know how to n play so bad

1:46 dude😂
I honestly want more of this type of video it was very creative, and entertaining ofc and the design was just getting ittt and my favorite was especially Paul's (Jacob) character and design and yeah the idea of making a D & D animation from Jaiden was a very good idea I want more
My family absolutely loves D&D there is a massive number of drawers for models maps paper and character sheets
I took half an hour to open a door just normal door not locked just the door no traps just an unlocked normal door
Someone take Larry’s pic and put it next to Paul’s they are literally the same just one has an axe and is blonde
How the Jaiden just turns into marks ex wife and the just spits acid in his face
Paul looks like larry from pokemon scarlet anc violet
Man, i wish i could play it too, it looks fun. though, i have no one to play it with. Is there like an online platform or something?
I know jt doesn't sound like it but in the original Mario says: So long King Bowser 12:38
The campaigns I’ve been in sound a lot like the ogre one but I was the ogre and I rizzed up a goblin l
My friend seduced a stone statue named Eric and the got married and I got adopted by the pharaoh and the pharaoh's wife it was weird
This was the best (= pls share more adventures!
Have you played any more D&D
Learned magic for years, *resorts to c4 bomb. 😅 that's hillarious
I love when the work said "it's worming time" and started worming all over the place

The invisible force was marks beer gut in the goblin cave

I ABSOLUTELY love Mario & Luigi OST
I love your character jaiden

She thought we wouldn't notice her putting vox machina in there
I love DnD
Me and my friends did a quick side mission and it was 3 of us in the room and a snake came in and all of use were being terrorized by this tiny little weak snake because we couldn’t hit it. 2 wizards and a barbarian😭🙏
When I played d&d I was a dragon born & a wizard
Invite me to the next d&d game I will bring the snacks
0:57 alpharad is Larry from paldea???
i don't really know what i'm doing but i'm running a 'campaign zero'. super simple plot:  you wake up locked in a dungeon with a hazey memory of what happened, you think that if you find out how you got trapped and who did it, you might be able to escape.   first part: you're chained up with a bunch of stuff to use (i just don't feel like listing them) and when you get out of the chains however a strange man named Daryl H. Roberts, an elderly man with a raspy voice who advocates drinking and gambling to children comes into the room, suspiciously right after you got out of the chains, and offers to help you escape the dungeon  second part: you end up in a hallway with 4 doors, three that lie, and one that tells the truth.   third part: once you guys get through the truth door you're met with you're first option, you could A, go through a tunnel full of skittsh bats that can and will try to attack you if spotted, B, use an object to try and break down a shut door using what you gathered in the begining of the campain, or C, and probably the most dangerous, listen to daryl and idk yet  thats all i got so far
Actually, - NO, not anything you think of, can happen in ye- olde, game. At least, not in Dungeons and Dragons! Perhaps one of the other, superhero, or other genre, games. There are Medieval Setting limitations, non- comic book, limtations! Something many, delicate,  Snow-Flakes, just don't get!
What is your class in your game?
I remember when I was at school one day we playing DND and my best friend tried to attack a spider and rolled the lowest possible and stabbed her self with a knife
JAIDEN HAS BEEN ✨️RANBOOZLED✨️
The branch shaped is the Moose or reindeers horn
Manager at Ye Old Mart of Wal .....lol
I want more dnd you draw the story really well
Luap/ Paul jr
DnD is peak I play with a not ok party
IS THIS IS A JOJO REFRENCE?
1:16 vox machina!
PAUL INTO LUAP IS SO CLEVER? i thought it was some lop eared sheep joke
This is a very bad idea for a first campaign you should statt with some clasic normal dnd stuff then move on to more crazy stuff
absolute cinema
please do more if these
17:11😮
So, we know that Ranboo was a Tabaxi Bard, and we can guess that Alpharad was a Human Barbarian by how they were drawn as a normal human and had a greataxe...  But what is Jaiden's class? Obviously a spellcaster, but I wonder what one.
Jaiden’s Dragonborn design kinda reminds me of Suzy from Deltarune, idk why
Paul looks like that sleep-deprived gym leader from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
I’m a year late and I’m still so amused. This video is great
"oak trees turning into birch" camman's worst nightmare
IF YOU DONT DO MORE IF THIS I WILL PUT A LAND MINE UNDER YOUR FLOOR BOREDS
i love how jaiden is a dragon
i love d&d so much but i have never played it before and now you have made me want to play it (i can't belive u added Vox machina characters)🤩
😅❤ never you actually play that me my brother always like to play that in me just for so old
TEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Did a quick scan of the comments is no one gonna mention the appearance of Vox Machina 😂
i wished jaiden turned into a dragon since she was half dragon already
W over he garden wall references
My favourite dnd moment is when my friend threw a penny at a terasque and got a nat20 and distracted it for five minutes and then went deeper into the cave and found me also a dragonborn without uuuuuuuh well Im being serious right now no I'm sorry this is gonna sound terrible but no pole I'm gonna say to sound appropriate my character also committed arson on an orphanage because he was starts with r ends with Ed by our second main enemy an this backstory was not made by me it was made by the DM and the time when I got a mimic spell carved into my kneecap and had to cut off my kneecap and proceeded to roll a 20 and perfectly avoid all nerve endings and have no pain at all and then there's another time when my friend said the n word five times as a distraction and again got Nat 20 btw this was a really unhinged dnd session and my friend is black so like he kinda was allowed but it was also just me the DM and him so yeah my dnd sessions with my friends are unhinged deal with it anyway have a nice day if you read here : )
WE NEED A PART 2
I actually had a tortoise named Mr. President, so I was very shocked to see it as a name possibility for this turtle. that's a funny coincidence
Most normal dnd session
could anybody tell me what song starts playing around 3:16? i can’t place it and it’s driving me crazy
can't believe no ones commented on "ye old wall of mart" he literally just works at fucking walmart and the other two are a dragon and a cat
absolute cinema
No ones commenting how his name went from Tomas to Tompson
What a banger of a first session!!!
1:38 Larry from Pokemon the normal gym leader
1:15 Vox Machina mentioned!
15:27
D&d story I befriend a water elemental by playing patty cake with it
Do you animate first or voice over first? I’m assuming voice over first. What does that look like?
1:15 crazy ahh face
I would pay (if I had money) to watch a show with 20 minute episodes of silly adventures with these 3 (+paul jr turtle)
was that a vox machina cameo Jaden? i peeped it 😆
Garten of ban ban
Garten of ban ban
Alpharad being larry from Pokemon Sc/V was peak!
Dude Dnd sounds actually so cool bro

Lol imagine Larry from Pokemon violet was the inspiration for paul
I subed:)
I love that Paul is just Larry from Violet
i love ranboo's character
I wish I knew how to play but I don’t because I’m stupid 😑
I’ve not played it either
1:14 I scrolled for like five minutes for someone commenting on this, but seriously,  did no one else notice the Vox Machina cameo?
I would not mind if she makes another one of these dungeons and dragons video. It’s so funny.
I thought tholomew was going to say “Avada cadabra” 16:04
1:15 vox machina jumpscare
You loser 4 million subscribers
On my very first session of dnd I tried to create tents using the spell plant growth (I know that’s not how the spell works per it’s description) and I got a natural one. A year later we were in a similar situation so I tried redoing it and AGAIN I got a natural one sprouting cacti from the ground damaging the entire party both times
Make more videos like that
You should do this again
Paul dgaf that he was turned into a zebra 😂😂 5:28 the whole video is hilarious, "ITS WORMING TIME!"
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Story telling is my favorite hobby by far also LOVE your videos 😢❤
I have 3 whole note books I made fill to the brim with story and chaos 😂
Hey, by the way, you mentioned my name in this video my name is Ella you mentioned it in your video oh my God I am so happy right now and they started laughing.
I’ve started a bar fight
❤ dnd sooooo fun
So long a bowser😊
Man, Larry really let himself go after losing his gym battle
1:16 THE LEGAND OF VOX MACHINA!!!!!!
The amount of Kirby music I heard in this video is overwhelming
OMG VOX MACHINA 1:16
Watching this after dming my own campaign... slimecicle is just lucky none of them were min-maxers
14:20 They do say you look like the ones you love
Stealing this campaign idea for the tutorial one shot I'm doing for my wife and her friends
ohh     no 😰 16:24
the ex wife and kid😭😭😂 14:21
15:47 so funny
My friends dnd campaign Im in is interesting-  We all are escaped prisoners and one of us really likes being romantic with ANYTHING not just humans. I’m an arsonist who is also a big murderer. We also have a little pet. Btw all of our campaign members are scared of someone’s character. We just committed a robbery as well! (FREE MONEY YIPPEE). Oh yeah we have a gun-
I know it’s like a year seens the video came out but we need a part 2! ❤❤
14:46 reverse sirenelope and odysseus
What happened to paul jr? (the turtle)
I need more of this
I just can't do this game honestly
DEPRESSION
Paul looking like Larry is hilarious.
The Plot twist!
I just realized the invisible force Zoot bumped into by the goblin camp door was Mark Thompson😂
1:32 OMG LARRY FROM POKEMON?!
Vox Machina just casually in the video lol.
CRITICAL ROLE REFF YALL WHY HAVENT I SEEN IT BEFORE

5:19 is the answer pokemon legends z-a?

4:11 Camman would be scared
RANNNBBOOOO
Funny and good story :D I like it
Question what Is the name of the Song at minute 16:35?
for some reason I want more of this.. almost want a series that she can make from time to time different adventures with her crew ahahah its so funny how she tells the story and the animation that goes with it XD
Excuuuuuse me! How can we watch it, and ignore that here: 1:15 we have the most fameous DnD band in history (so far)?????
so i can just make the story with my friends?  *shlawg my fantasy oc stories can come true*
jaiden is my favorite story teller
I have a frog in our current campaign that absorbs fire and when it does it grows it’s very chaotic it can also shoot fire and talk to me through my thoughts so I named it toasty!
"The Alphabet Backwards" Is literally what I said to.
1:26 my average RPG OC
I love dnd
this reminds me of the time i befriended the potentially evil cheese man with room to improve on max friendship
Dude i was making a joke to saduce this vampire playboy guy, and i rolled a nat 20! My group still wont let me forget about it 🤣🤣🥺
Some few weeks ago I did dnd with a friend (he was also a dragon born) and I rolled 20, twice. Love the vids
:D
Hello, my name is RJ Luap!
Can you please make more 😢
I would pay for this to be commissioned to a full series.
who else thought ranboo was smokeebee on the thumbnail?
I have a character for you :D skeleton with a pipe :3
I love how Jacob is just Larry as a blonde
THAT IS SUCH A LARRY 1:30
I KNOW
The crown is a head crab but reskinned
1:31 A grade 9 fixer. I think.
"0I hit an invisible force I couldn't see" 😂😂😂
I love how Jacob is just Larry
1:38 Ah! I love Ye old Mart of Wall!
10:45 🙋‍♂(German)
I play DandD
HA marks not even evil
in three weeks I will be playing D&D for the first time, wish me luck, and fun. We made our caracters, knuckles The Great, The Shadow and Zonik, we did that on purpose
:)
Part 2 pls
One of my characters was named space toes, an elf traveling through space selling alien toes on the black market.
What class was Jaiden
12:18 absolutely perfect reference and music
If you want more dnd on demand, I definitely recommend Baldur's Gate 3. It's on Steam, XBox, and PS5. It's like a dnd video game, and you can play it so much without getting bored.
and possed to acid bast him
i have played one dnd sesh and it consisted of one of our friends (their character name was karen and they were canonically a karen) complaining of high prices when leather armour costed like 8 bucks, and us repeatedly sending our short friend to their death (we sent them down a hole in a shipwreck using rope and they almost got eaten alive by evil spirits). 10/10, would play again.
2:52 I love coconut mall
Charlieslimesicle as D&D master is a VERY dangerous move
Can U do another one again
Well I'll get hooked into playing D&D
we not gonna talk abt the 'legend of vox machina' shoutout?.....no k
12:38 ah yes, I love just casually n64 'solonggayBowser!"-ing sheep
Long live Luap!!
During DnD my friend impregnated a mimic 😅😅😅
Why does Paul look like Larry for Pokémon scarlet
10:45 Must've been the wind...
I’m a newbie dnd player, and I just did a session with a group of people. We stole some very powerful magical artefacts from a very powerful arch demon, and we all got to pick which ones we each got to keep. My tiefling paladin got a pocket watch that could caste haste on two allies without requiring any concentration. And then I noticed no one wanted to swallow down the God’s Blood since it was unknown what it would do and the dm implied that it could be potentially dangerous, so my paladin took it. He got a plus 5 bonus on every single roll so he was insanely powerful, but he had become very bloodthirsty and mentally unstable, and if he was to lose all of his hp then only one failed roll from an ally would cause him to be permanently dead. It was a lot of fun though! My paladin Lucius savagely murdered a big ogre and the arch demon’s three pet hell hounds, one of which being named Princess. Dnd is a lot of fun.
I love how ranboo always plays terrified characters. He does it so well its impeccable
I saw vox machina in your animation 😂😂😂😂😂
i love when jaiden blasts the clay worm with acid it recreates that 1 meme
omg the storys soooo funny
2:06 RANBOO MY BELOVED :0 /j
First time i flirted everything i saw and had an army of simps
Was i the only one seeing those 4 character that weren t absolutely casual ( Sorry for the bad eng)
Im playing today for the first time in a whole and im so excited
10:03 the goblins are cooking the horse from season 2 of adventure time
Nice
THIS WAS NOT A YEAR AGO-  It still hits so good- ^^
I play dnd, I get it. One time I drank tar
MACE IS NOT PEPPER SPRAY IT A BALL SPICKY BALL
That's some of the best storytelling I've ever seen on YouTube or anywhere else for that matter💜
this was brilliant i laughed so hard i swear you live a masterpiece
I know this was a year ago but I got this video on my recommendation on my first day playing
I remember seeing that depression clip so many times. Also am i the only one who expected the sheep to turn into a hot man then paul fell in love...lmao but really this was much better and much more wholesome
Did anyone see the horse from adventure time
Why did it take me so long to slow down the turtle-naming scene to realize it's a big ole Over the Garden Wall reference.   Gold.
I saw the acid blast the moment Zot pulled away.
This sounds like an extremely fun campaign!
1:15 Ayo vox machina
Ironic how a man who lost everything he has including his family, has never experienced depression.
Ye olde mart of wal
i really wanna play D&D but i have 3 friends and im convinced theyd find it boring and just go on their phone
Loving that Legend of Vox Machina reference at 1:18.
One thing about dnd beware of nat 1
11:37 Kirby falling meme 12:11 Do a barrel roll!
I want more of these
I like clash rolay
Me seeing this vid, “the prophecy has come true A YOUTUBER IS PLAYING DND LETS GOOOOOOO
Great!!!
That guy in a suit reminds me of some one
First time i played was today, i got friendzoned by a goat and anotherplayer killed her (name goat: Krokus) and i killed that player
🦓🕷️🐛🚪📯
I made my own version of d&d called dungeons dragons and nuggets the best way to describe it is blade and sorcery with a lot of mods and guns
I accidentally set the world on fire
The Vox Machina group getting wasted at the table behind is something I'll never be happier about
When I was playing dnd for my first time I ate 10 pounds of poisonous sand (I was a magical cat that couldn’t get poisoned)
4:14 FUECOCO
Can you please, please make an animation for the Sword AF: delivering destiny
0:25💀
Mark most likely was the worm fighting jaiden after that he was revived😂😂
Is Paul Larry from Pokémon?
Part 2 when?????
:D
✨️depression✨️ 14:10
0:50 cuphead reference
i`m dm  of very strange dnd versin ask me questions
Mark Thompson Deserved Better
I would love to see a sequal
So happy you joined us
If i had a nickel every time a YouTubers DnD game included Walmart id have 2 nickels which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice
RANBOOOOOOO❤
9:13 ahhhhhhhhhhhh
Chuckles
Every time I see Dragon Jaiden, I keep on thinking Susie from Deltarun.😂lol
Hiiiiiiii Jaiden I'm a big fan❤❤❤
In tweaking I have to work on a dnd character and world IN A NIGHT,TONIGHT
3:25 in all honesty, the sheep looks like Asriel Dreemurr
I need a part 2
IM WACTHING THIS NONE STOP
I have a lot of dice for D&D but I want more
Acid him point blank hits me hard
A D&D story video, animated by Jaiden, with Zelda music. .........why did I not know I needed this? Why did I only realize it while watching that this was everything I've ever needed in my life? It combines my loves of smooth, cute, and fun/funny animation, D&D, and Zelda! Just...yes! All of my yes, so many yes!
1:25 do you know who the dragon born is cuz he kills dragons?
I've been playing DND for the first time this year and i learned that the Command spell does in fact have an open-ended aspect. It says "possible commands CAN be" but you can theoretically do anything you can convince your DM to accept 😅 Last session our paladin commanded "chillax"
16:22 i though tgat wus smthn else...
Had to dab my eyes as tears was trying to escape from the absolutely peak cinema im seeing
I love your references of Vox Machina and Adventure Time
D&D is literally my favorite thing to do and i just finished one campaign and 2 one shots (one of which i was the DM) and i now know almost everything there is to know about D&D
I love how she adds things she enjoys in the woods as black figures like fuecoco and the beast
That was sick
Is it be or I kinda ship Paul and barthanamew NOT THE ACTUAL PEOPLE IRL JUST THE CHARACTERS IDK IF THATS WRONG
This was also my first play through!
The Luap shifting to Paul And The two saying “Ohhhhh” Felt like I was watching Dora The Explora
I kinda want to see what would happen if they sculpted a video game character out of clay like sans
Just by the text i can tell this was made by slimecicle😂😂
0:56 IS THAT LARRY WITH AN AXE?!
Yeah 1 time My team was beat up by bats
That was great DnD, miss..  MOre plz
I CAST FIRE BALL🔥
We have a dnd club at my school
9:51 That pony looks kind of familiar, is it a reference to something?
15:26 I was not expecting that…
I fucking love DND
Loved seeing the vox machina team in the tavern! Very cute detail :3
9:54 is that the horse from adventure time?
😃😱🤩😂
So, by my imagination, i summon a page from the declaration of Independence for the goblins who need freedom from orcs. (Unfortunately they cannot read.)
Man like today three of my team (including me) went to the after life almost dying because of an explosion caused by an orb being slapped out of someone’s hands? Yet still that killed one of are members.
This deserves a 1000%. Perfect Just perfect 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What class you choos
9:51 IS THAT THE HORS EFORM ADVENTURE TIME?!
I USE THUNDER SPELL😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
In my campain we ran into cyborg dog things sfter escaping a lab, my party members were high except me and one other (long story) so they saw corgies so we needed to defeat them, slowly they all sobered up except one which was failing all their rolls except at the end, so when i did the roll to damage the last one, i ripped off its head from a nat 20, and my dm said he would make me a weapon out of it
I have a board
Paul does not even look inpressed at the end of the video
This entire video I was just jamming to the Zelda beats
Thank you so much for this video. Very instructive.
D&D is the best game ever
I remember when my friends and I played D&D for the first time, every enemy and optical we encountered we offered my bf as an offering. 😂😂 we were really chaotic, and kept offering his body as if his charisma was 18 points. 😂 they weren’t and he would go along with it, flirting with every enemy and optical. 😂
This is fantastic. Definitely yoinking some ideas for my own campaign in the future. ^^
6:55 i like the implication that all turtles just talk like Pokémon
I LOVE the Vox Machina reference!
Jaiden is a nerd🤓
Idk why but this feels so Ramshackle coded 😂😂😂
the ending reminded me at how our group dealt with a kitsune like creature.... we basically did a colonoscopy on the poor fellow.... i loved this it makes me wanna keep playing
i have -1 in charisma multiplier
Definitely gonna need more lf this 👌🏽🤣🤣
DUDE THAT WAS AMAZING THIS IS EXACTLY WHU I WANNA DO THIS STUFF AGHH
i've watched this a handful of times now and i have yet to see someone comment on how the horse the goblin is spit roasting is the weird horse from adventure time
Please make more
me being a Gravity Falls fan: DD&more D
Bro he throw his son two times in the air 😂😂🥲🥲😭😭AND HIT THE WALL TWO TIMES
THAT DRAGONBORN HAS A TAIL
14:08 not the Depression 😂
I had a story in the cave one at the start and I literly choped it's head off with 22 dmg
That sounds like dungeons dungeons and more dungeons from gravity falls
0:57 that’s just Larry the gym leader and elite 4 member in paldea
When I played Dungeons & Dragons, I choose Dragon born
jaiden should just make a show at this point
Nice adventure time reference
The fact Paul named is turtle is sons name is crazy
😂😂😂
I love D&D it is so fun to watch D&D campans and to see what fun they had
I love playing dnd so I hope you like it
I’m rewatching this vid at 10:41 is that from centaur world
I got inspired by this video to play dnd, I played one 2 weeks ago and omg you were right it’s so fun! I loved it and want to play more!
I love how a clay penguin was mentioned and then I hear roar of king dedede start playing.
1:16 AHHHHHHH A CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE!!!!!
I LOVE DND
I love that vox machina is just chilling.
omg as soon as jayden turned into his ex wife all i thought was ACID BREATH
Adventure Time horse
SOMEONE TEACH ME. PLEASE!?
Anyone relised at 4:34 Fuecoco is in the bush
Hey jaiden you you should do more dnd I like watching and listening to the campaigns
Over one and a half years later she still hasnt posted the dnd gameplay
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😊
I’ve been playing DND since about early 2023 and I think I’m better than some people who’ve been playing for six years. I’ve memorized some exact spells if not most know most classes features so if you forget your character sheet and you play a rogue, I gotcha.
You are one of the people that got me into playing D&D
Jaiden YOU NEED TO PLAY Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth
I didn’t know all of my favorite content creators knew eachother
I love D&D! i'm gonna try it out for the first time in some weeks, so excited!!
10:52 the horse from adventure time
The way she just threw the turtle 🤣
"i miss my wife Zoot, i really do. Ill be back" -Mark Thompson
I STAN ZUTE
Jaiden character is basically the Dragonborn
This is a literal movie in 17 minutes well done
At 0:23 I knew somehow I was thinking he wants to do it. And I wasn’t disappointed. 😅
1:43 that sounds like something that gray still plays would name his theme park
i don't understand are with LGBTQ or fucking not
Bro it's vox machina characters on the inn
This was awesome!!!1!
Love ya videos
Can we get more content like this? I like it to be called "DnD Storytime with Jaiden and Familiars" if possible. You can ignore my name suggestion. But please, I love this type of content
1:14 Jaiden really thought I’d miss the Vox Machina reference watching the video for the 4th time
0:57 Jacob looks like a blonde Larry Lol
Why is Jacob playing Larry from Pokemon
HOW IS THIS 1 YEAR OLD ALREADY!!!???!!!???
This was just as good as actually playing doungons and dragons
FOR THE LOVE OF BOBTOD PLEASE MAKE MORE OF THESE
i love the reference were the worm turns to ashes
That was funny i loved it
I KNEW IT 16:47
DND is the best
i haven't played d&d.
I remember watching Jaiden’s D&D Game on the Subathon 2 Years ago I still remember the Acid Blast and I will never forget that because of how Funny and Unexpected it was
OMG A VOX MACHINA CAMEO

Ranboo jacob and slimecicle sounds like an extremely fun dnd party
Ah, so Jaiden is the murderhobo of the group! :D   Glad y'all seemed to be having a blast from the looks of it via the video.  Hope that you guys post more happenings if you keep playing TTRPGs over time. :)
I play D&D my game went much weirder with interdenominational travel killing a dragon and its not even half way done digging up grave with disrespect a dwarf throwing not one but two javelins over castle wall and hitting two guys it the head somehow with disadvantageous. climbing a 656 foot tower to save a KID!!! and the a fight with a red wizard who cursed one of my team mates into bread with a face lucky for us he had magic to move. we had to run from the fight as the guy was close to Unkillable also it is still not over as I am writing this and that's with skimming over a LOT of it. I love it
Just the derpy horse from adventure time 9 51
Jacob's character just trauma dumping in the beginning of the game is such a classic Dnd thing to do. If i had a nickel everytime someone told me their character's life story in less than 5 minutes into the game as the DM lets us get acquainted. i would have two nickels which isnt alot but its weird that it happened twice.
I started playing DND a few weeks ago and so far it’s absolutely insane. It’s why I love this game so much
Uh… that was incredibly entertaining 😅
am play dnd this sunday am a blue dragon born
17:04 Sounds like you had fun.
“Dude Let’s Kill The Horse” reference is crazy
I love d&d
I reeeaally want play DnD with my aunt Paulina sometime. A board game that’s all about imagination and socializing? SIGN ME UP!!
I'd LOVE to try dnd but i can't because idk what to start with or how to
lozww music slaps
Im still confused on what dnd is and how to play like what are the die for?
I’d love to see a part 2!  DnD is too fun when people just throw the rules to the pits
DONT YOU THINK I DIDNT SPOT VOX MACHINA AT 1:16
1:14 VOX MACINA?!
Love this video my first character was also a dragon born
3:29
The acid blast in the face😂
That was an awesome adventure. I do hope you get to play again and regale us with more fantastic stories.
i just tried it with my firends. im a dragon, who is the father of this little elfling, that tried to kill 2 people and still thinks he’s right. so yah pretty cool game
Cool video but what happened to the turtle
can we see your caracters papers jaden. just for fun. for other dnd players just like me. please.
Your character designs are amazing and the animals are all cute, including the anthro ones.
I have never played D&D but it seems so fun!
So lucky unlike my friends
luap.... why am i just now realizing its paul backwards
the paul/luap scene was amazing 😭
This video is exactly what I needed right now. Hello from 2025
❤
im an black acid dragon born too!
giving Larry from Pokemon violet/scarlet
9:35 no you left Paul jr the turtle!
voxmachina just casual thrown in there
9:11 Anybody else recognizes the meme?
8:43 i guess DM rolled natural 1
Yee o'l mart of wall
i love how you can tell when they rolled a high or low number
In a game that I played, my teammate turned on me killed me used a spell to control me and forced me to kill the love of my life who I had only had one conversation with in my entire life and then came back onto my side when he realised we were winning and we defeated the evil vampire trying to kill ‘witches’ so that was crazy
My dnd character is a dragon born shifter called Lily
TURTLE 🐢🐢🐢
Man, you GOT to love D&D after that.
I liked it when the clay worm was like, "ITS WORMIN TIME!" And wormed all over the place
ESTO LO DEBES TRADUCIR A ESPAÑOL, ES 100% NECESARIO 😂
whats the music in 13:28
𝓞𝓵𝓭 𝓸𝓪𝓴 𝓲𝓷𝓷
In my campaign, I my players were facing a hard enemy, and one of my players yelled, "YOUR CHEATING," and it's now a running joke lol 😂
@JadienAnimations I kind of want a dedicated series for DnD now. (Nat 20s for Jadein all day baby)
So jaiden was Inumaki?
I can’t believe this was posted a year ago now
I played DnD for the first time today (with friends), and it was amazing!
I love the way jaiden draws Vox Machina they are so silly
I always play end
my voxmachina addicted ass noticed the reference right away
Idk how to draw a dragonborn and it makes me sad every time i try T_T
I love your channel 🩷I have a D&D character but no friends to play with😭
Paul: *Truma dumps* Zute: ...I'm Zute ABSOUTE CINAMA
vox makina referanse?!?!
I knew that luap was Paul’s son all along
god this reminds me of the various explorer rps I  have been in, in the game called Mystery Dungeon RP on Roblox tbh, I love being stupid idiot pokemon.
Hell yes😊
😮pls we need more!!
😂смешно!
sadly, my friends has short attention span😔 so i cant play it 😢😢
why wouldnt you pick up the destroyed gold wall into town to sell them for moneys?
Omg the part about jaiden doing all that mushy heartstring tughing nonsense with the ex wife disguise just to turn around and BLAST the old dude with acid sent me into ORBIT 😂😂😂😂😂
Alpharads character is literally Larry from pokemon s v
I saw keyleth,vex,grog and pike from the legend of vox machina
D&D sounds kinda fun!
How do you play d&d ?
At one session I was at, a RAT seduced a grandma
Bro the moment Ranboo was mentioned I sat up so fast they’re literally my favourite YouTuber/streamer and I swear they actually stole my f-cking gender because I identified as a normal cis human being before I watched them, a year later, I learn that I am in fact not Cis, and am actually a Nonbinary/Genderfluid blob.
Jaiden, I'm 11 and I was wondering if you have any tips on finding a DND group. I've been looking for one for over a year and every time I ask someone, they'd laugh in my face and say "oh so you play on a phone setting." It would be well appreciated if you'd please give me some tips.
i like the idea that all the goblins livd :D
yoo what is the song from 16:35 to 17:43
Jaiden”i am gonna Be a cool dragon” Ranboo”i am gonna Be a cat” Jacobus”i am gonna Be larry”😂😂
I love that he’s Larry front the normal gym 😂😂
I remember the disguise self as ex wise thing in the live stream
“Turtle final answer-“ “WORM!” Killed me
1:13 VOX MACHINA REFERENCE!
I just Got the game😂
I play d and d and I feel so good because nunn of my friend know what it was entil I told them
Ahhhmmm CALL OF CTHULHU????
I played dnd and folded a centuars ribcage. Fun times.
Honestly the thing that pushed me over the edge to start playing dnd. Thank you Jaiden for introducing me to peak.
"AND YOU....Paul.........anyway." best dialogue I've ever heard.
"It's worming time" That one really got me. 😂
9:13 ash baby reference
RANBOO AND SLIMECICLE MENTIONED
Oh my god Ranboo😂😂 he’s a catttt
WELCOME TO DND, YOUR NOW ETERNAL HOME!!! DONT TRY TO GO BACK, YOULL GET TOO ADDICTED TO!!!!!
Please play Warhammer 40K
I literally just played my first campaign as a Half-elf ranger. Met a Goblin by the name of Bobblin. We took Bobblin the Goblin along with us just so our DM could make funny Gobblin speaking noises, lol.
My favourite part was when the Giant Worm said "It's wormin' time" and wormed all over the place!
I play it all the time with my friends
d&d is sooooo fun
10:38 “AND THATS PEELIN, NGAR
1:13 is vox machina TV show🗿🗿🗿
They never said human children and I count three Ari tofu and tostada
Omg, it was hilarious🤣🤣🤣
Jaiden can u make another D&D video pls 🙏
17:08 did they forget the turtle?
Please make more dnd videos
So we all agree that using command and then gaslighting an enemy is a genius move?
Disguising yourself as the Manager’s EX Wife was disgusting, disturbing, and downright distasteful.  *I loved it.*
I LOVE THIS VIDEO YOU SHOULD DO MORE DND VIDEOS
NOOO MARK
The point blank acid on mark is just savage 😂
THOLEMU IS SOO CUTE BRU I WANT HIM
I love playing dnd
Oh dude this was hilarious I’d tune in every week for dnd content like this just sayin
This is one of the best campaigns and just- stories I've ever heard
15:20 My ex wife still misses me... BUT HER AIM IS GETTING BETTER!!
poor thompson 😢
8:26 THE DRAGONBORNE(dnd), IS A DRAGONBORN (skyrim)
You should start a dnd podcast
i want to play d and d I've never played it
I love DnD

It has now been confirmed that Jaden animations has a thing for ogres
This is really awesome! I would try to make stuff like this but I don't have anything to animate with lol
good vido
Tf is Zoot's INT? 1???
Seeing the cat charechter reminds me of my -10 intelligence cat character Nugget that I played recently.
0:28 dude that happens like every session for me. My friends are insane, for example we nuked a giant that we were not supposed to fight at like level 5 by bringing a bomb into their stomach. Also we are really good at making bombs
I wanna play dnd now…. 😂
Why is paul just larry
0:27 that’s just normal dnd
This would be great for fannart
Why is vox michina here😂
0:25 charisma means rizz
4:14 OVER THE GARDEN WALL REFERENCE?????!?!?!?
Ye Olde mart of wall 🧱
Can’t say I expected the Undertale mercy kill in here but I can’t say I didn’t find it hilarious lol
i saw the Vox machina reference
the sheer joy i felt seeing keyleth, vex, grog and pike at 1:14 is indescribable
I would definitely be a tree and then as soon as I saw the big tree just yell “GRANDPA”    3:20   GRANDPAAAAAAA
VOX MACHINA IN THE TAVERN!!!
"Turtle! Turtle! Yes it is turtle"
15:24  "I miss my wife Zuut, i miss her a lot. I'll be back"
that was a cool story :)
i herd blox fruits music 😐
I NEW IT WAS HIS KIDDDDD
Is the jaiden's persona an reference to suzie of deltarune?
4:15 was that the monster from over the garden wall?
I just realised that Luap is Paul backwards, the sheep is Paul Jr, as a sheep he called himself Luap
You put Kiki, pike, Grog and Vex in it!!!! I love you for that hahaha 1:15
Anyone know the song playing during 16:05? I can't find it for the life of me :(
This was the funniest and fun and epic game ever ❤❤❤🎉
1:41 Ye old mart of wal 😭🖐️
heres my dnd story (worth reading): ok so my character is a lesbian half-orc and there was this giant crystal causing snow to possess anyone it hit, anyway my party and i were killing them and stuff and got to the crystal, i tried to seduce possessed person #4 bc it was the only woman and it worked, we went to a different floor than my party fighting for their lives, and 4 and i... get familiar... anyway i go back to the crystal my whole party could not destroy and i try to seduce it. i roll my d20, and get a 20. the crystal exploded (its form of an orgasm) and the session ended and we watched frozen
“DEPRESSION”
am i the only one who feels bad for mark
guess who's here in 2025? also, I'm trying d&d tomorrow, so, wish me luck!!
What is dungeons and dragons
You should do more of this
I love how the depressed guy is literally is just Larry from pokemon
1.45 Its a Kira yoshikage reference?
14:24 OH BOO HOO LET ME PLAY A SAD SONG ON THE WORLDS SMALLEST VIOLIN
“Zoot stares longingly into marks eyes… then proceeds to point blank acid blast him straight in the face” LOL
Gets a wand Normal people: I am gonna cast sealing magic to seal away the wicked wizard D&D veteran: DEPRESSION
Keyleth! Grog!

4:33 MR PRESIDENT!! IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE?!

M O R E
Of course its a kobold...
Can I ples have a free ari and tofu Plush I think they are cute and I am also subbed and love ur vids
0:57 center guy looks like Larry
You have to turn this into a movie also when the funniest parts is when zuot acid blast mark point blank from the mouth because it was just so wholesome and then blast
the vox machina cameo at the beginning is everything to me
Wait wait wait wait wait WAIT im just now rewatching this, IS THAT A VOX MACHINA REFRENCE??!?!?!?!?
Anyone else noticed the vox machina reference
Anyone here in 2025?
I feel like every YouTuber I’ve ever watched has been connected because of this video
It would be interesting to know what is the name of the music that plays at minute 10:40, since it doesn't work for me with Shazam
alferad looks like Larry from pokémon scarlet and violet
4:33 over the garden wall reference!!!! (And the beast is in the forest at 4:15 :D)
Paul had a rough childhood 😅
The subscribe thing was probably pretty rad
4:16 “THE BEAST IS UPON ME”
15:27 is the most funny thing ive heard in my life.

Ah yes. My favorite DND characters. The furry, the dragonborn and Larry
8:26 😂 8:45 Critical fail from the opponent.  10:55 🤣 The clay monster fight scene was super entertaining!
As someone whose been playing Dnd for the past 2½ years now seeing somekne new describe it is So funny XD
Is no one going the point out the vox machina characters from the beginning??
This vid was sickmits thebbest
"Your music's bad and you should feel bad!"
I love coming back to this video every so often. Watched it a while back and now I finally also started playing DnD - as a DM!! So it's extra hilarious to see how you guys do the absolute most unexpected things lmao Can't wait to watch this again in a little while! :>
i wanna play it but have no one to play whit
RANBOO MENTIONED!?!?!
Maybe if I ask my friend play this game with only imagination
so heartfelt and action pact
I need three seasons of this
The first ever dungeons and dragons game I played I craeted the pizza industry.
16:32 song name?
that was great!
Paul kinda looks like Larry from pokemon
With how mark introduced himself I was expecting him to then pull a Killer Queen type stand after the monologue.
This was so funny 😂
ACID BLAST!!!! Mark :my ex wife is trying to kill meeeeeeeeee
theres even a pokemon dnd campaign and a mario dnd campaign now all we need is a legend of zelda dnd and a kirby dnd
i think we all need a part two!
the vox machina shoutout at the beginning is cute😊
I have adhd&d, now roll for communication!
Is no one acknowledging that she drew alpharad as larry from pokemon scarlet and violet
This was surprisingly really good and heartfelt.
Do you like legend of Zelda? Seriously Jaiden i see and hear zelda stuff.  Example: full steam ahead plays in this video.
VOX MACHINA MENTIONED!!!!!???????
Paul looks like the normal gym leader of paldea
2:17 MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN REFERENCE??? (please gimme a sign that I'm not the only one who likes that :'D)
Ah yes my favourite spell “DEPRESSION!!!” Edit: 1:18 yay Tabaxi my D&D character is a Tabaxi
Don't listen to him he's a zebra🤣
1:15 i love how vox machina is also there
The crown controlling Barthollowmew reminds me of the Master Crown in Kirby
13:41 ah, nice Naruto reference… good ol’ Tobi…
15:27 AND PRECEDES TO ACID BLAST HIM POINT-BLANK FROM THE MOUND.    Btw that made me laugh so hard i started wheezing from laughing
I used to think d&d was boring bc I didn't rlly know sh- BUT anyways, now I'm trying to restrain myself from asking if I can play d&d with my older sister, but I don't want to bc 1: she'll say no. 2: she'll rub it in my face that I want to play d&d now. (Lol ima ask soon)
Ah yes the “Ye olde mart of wall” 1:41
at 9:51 is that the horse the ice king disguises himself in in adventure time?
i also was a dragonborn for my first DND character
Did anyone notice Vox Machina?
0:48 it’s ranboo say it RIGHT!
Have you seen smokeebee
1:31 THAT LARRY
The start with ogre breh was so funny
This game is not fun...  THIS GAME IS CHAOTIC FUN!!! CHAOTIC FUN IS EVEN BETTER!!
I adore that you can see the nat 1 or nat 20, because "he slipped" or "he totally missed"
Bro it’s only been 00:28 seconds and she already got me laughing
9:51 “dude lets kill the horse”
3 things  1) nice Voc Machina reference  2) I love the wild sheep chase. Its such a great one shot starter  3) welcome to the hobby! Its a hell of a lot of fun
A s q certified dnd nerd i just have to say that you cant do alot of stuff like sound waves and shockwaves
Kirby and the forgotten land King Dedede boss fight music starts playing at 15:40
16:15  The restraining order 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The tabaxi is a bard? Hmmm........
Love the critical role reference😅😅😅
I love the charachters
9:00 was this intended to be like a Magolor + Master Crown reference?
That reminds me that I very like D&D but I have no one to play with..
I love dnd
Oh man I'm only 3:52 in but I think I played this module before. Good times.
I need to play DND with you, it's too lovely chaotic not to. If anything, i don't think you were chaotic enough.
1:21 is he a tabaxi or just a cat
Please make this into a series if it’s not to late
I freaking love any start to a dnd campaign, it's always just as chaotic as in this vid!
1:15 is that Vox Machina?
I do not know but that's the fake horse from finn and jake
I love how Jaiden just became a psychiatrist and casted depresion on Mark then obliterated him with acid blast in his face
I'm not going to even try, and make sense of that mess.
was rewatching the video bc i thought it was funnyand I was drinking water and almost spit it out bc of the peeler 10:55 😔
1:16   VOX MOCINA MENTION YESSS (Spelt that completely wrong oh well :p)
PLEASE DO THIS AGAIN, but trust me grab a large amount of friends it gets even more chaotic and even funnier. even if not please do this again
Can I tell a story of playing DND before and I’m just saying what happened so I’m like an elf person and there’s like these other people I can’t remember and a guy like troll person hired for a job I’m like and the other people like OK should we go there? Ask us to wait we will go on a tour guide thing and then the zombie plant things not from plants and zombies is your tracking us I tried to help them with my flute well guess what nothing happened fight them then we find a sword and it wants us to bring it towards original owner, so we do that and then I can’t remember the rest of the lore
My party member once tried to put himself into a bag of holding, he came out traumatized
Funny how king de de de's theme 0lays when 5hey fight a penguin
CATBOO CONFIRMED
What kind of dragon are you Jaiden?
MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I MUST HAVE MMMMMOOOOOORRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing story!🐲🐉🏰🐑🐈‍⬛🐈
1:16 holy shit its vox machina!
Wasn’t expecting jaiden to use power word depression and then blasting them point blank with acid
MAKE MORE! I love what you do keep it up 👍… Oh and have a good day if you read this.
15:19 this is insane and savage bro
Plz do dnd again plsss!!
"how would you like to deal with this situation?"  "point blank giga blast"
Just me, or is Paul just Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet but blond.
The fact that all of my favorite YouTubers did this together makes me so happy -w-
Ohh i love the Vox Machina reference xD
my cherector "guts" from berserk if ur live already sucks read berserk and it ll suck even more
I made the mistake of assuming this would actually explain how D&D works. Instead I got a wild adventure story with the kind of imagination I haven't experienced since childhood.
I immediately realized that luap was just paul backwards
Jaiden is not sigma
After watching the actual session and coming back to this animation its more funny
That was..... Some dnd session
I happy whit my family go train dunheons a dragons do you give mi type whit game dunheons a dragons go traing?😅😄❤👍
Jaiden dragonborns don't have tails
I just realized that at 1:14 it's Vox Machina with Vex, Pike, Keyleth, and Grog!!!!
I KNEW IT she did blast him with acid
Hey people ya wanna know something the type of Fantasy animal Jaden probably doesn't know is in Fact a drake and it's not Drake but a D. R. A. K. E This is the defence: Legs:0 Wings:0 =Wyrm  Legs:2 Wing:0 =Lindworm  Legs:0 Wing:2 =Amphithere  Legs:2 Wings2 =Wyvern   Legs:4  Wings:0 = Jaidens character a D. R. A. K. E not Drake  Legs:4 Wings:2 =Dragon city the place of dragons that have dragons and not drakes in Fact you can make dragon combinations with logic for some unlogical reasons.   Anyway this is just for fun
This is peak
Video start out very dark
i almost died in my campaign bc i tried to catch a weasel like it was a okemon and they all jumped me and now im enemys with the leader of weasels :P
3:08 Clear Nat 1
Love your vids
Congratulations you got a new subscriber 🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊
Mm
We need this to be an anime show ❤
This is a valid DnD representation 😂
we need a ep 2
So this one time when i was playing dnd with my brother, i was a bear and ended up SHARTING to the moon after a nuke blew up
Is that the horse from Adventure time :O
THAT PLOT TWIST AT THE END WITH PAUL WAS CRAZY I LOVE DMS LOL
Music at 8:14?
I really hope you make more d & d content its so funny and cool
@slimesicile
i love D&D
A thing I really liked was that the sheet probably said jaiden had a mace but she interpreted that as MACE and slimecicle just went along with it
It’s a coincidence that my first dungeon and dragons character is also a black scaled dragon borne warlock
This was such a fun D&D experience. The disguise self to then acid vomit was a great play. 😂
Hey do U know someone made a FNF mod of U (idk if U have seen it yet but its REALY cool) its called 'Braking point'
You had Vox Machina in your inn? 😊
as a long time DM, Charlie did an AMAZING job at it. And I have no idea how it was your first session it feels like your 100th
I should give D&D a chance
Totk link's rauru arm is the right arm
Is Paul’s design based on Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet?
Do a pt2
and then bartholomew wakes up the next morning, having failed to use the wand to break the time loop. his misery will continue
What cover of king dedede is being played at 15:40?
15:20  I'm crying
I can't be the only one, but when i think of d&d, stranger things is the first thing that comes to mind lol
IT'S WORMING TIME!
Why tf did you yeet the poor turtle ?
i am 10 and i love d&d
>immediately starts eating the clay  as a veteran DnD player im so proud of you Jaiden
My teammate tried to eat one of yhe monsters attackjng us but failed so hard that she died instead
i know this is one year ago but i need a part 2
Play as kirby
12:37 I need to know if alpharad phrased it like that exactly
at like 12 mins into the video: you found the stick of truth
Just today I have played a game of dnd and now see a Dragonborn and a Walmart involved but instead we used target and the dungeon master kidnapped the target dog
I love the Vox Machina refference!
14:08 The draconic script framing her power word does, in fact, read “Depression”.
bro those goblins be cooking ice kings horse custom from adventure time
It wot be cool to see you play mqgic the gatering comander😊
The fact that Luap was Paul backwards and nobody noticed is just one of those things that gets me lol
Vox machina 1:15
15:59 that was a Nat 1 wasn’t it ?
Hello Jaiden I like animation and dnd 2
PLEASE DO ANOTHER!!!!!!!!
1:59 dang :(
Who realized the beast from over the garden wall is there
Jaiden, play Ordem paranormal RPG.
What about the time loop problem?
1:16 vox machina W
0:37 ok you convinced me
Pike and grog just in the opening
I was scrolling through my YouTube and this same video popped up twice so one video slot was this video slot after that video slot this video also
Overall it would be so cool if Jaiden do more of these
"i point blank acid him with my mouth in the face" - jaidan  me- GYAD DAMN
1:12 Love the Vox Machina characters
What normal worm is large enough to strangle someone
The dm IS the world and it's rules
question are you a dragonborn sorcerer, wizard or warlock
This is genuinely the funniest crap i have seen in my life
3:20 good job!
Vox machina is connon in this world.  Very pog.
I love Paul he’s my new spirit animal
Jaiden can roll either a nat 20 and lose or a nat 1 and win
Jaiden would be the best person to play d&d with since her imagination is soooooo fun and awesome 🤩 😃 🥳
"IT'S WORMIN TIME" Got me dying.
Wonderful adventure. I praise the GameMaster!
Poor Paul. His character arch sounds relatable. Also Mark Thompson does resemble a retired Mario a bit for some reason
Hey jaiden ask charlie about corn
I love that Jaiden saw “mace” in the equipment and immediately thought pepper spray
Jaiden Charlie said he would love to do another he would do it in a heartbeat
16:04  "YOU'RE MY PERSONAL HELL!!!" 🔥🔥🔥
I need to make friends who play DND
My D&D character is a sheep LOL
Ok I unsubscribed
There was a lot of lore in this. I don’t have to say anything else I just have to say that there was a lot of lore in this and I like that.
I like the vox machina reference in the beginning
I didn’t notice that the cat is ronbo
That seems like a fun one-shot! Was it home brewed or is it online? If it is online, do you have a link?
My friend's DnD campaign had him find a cat that turned out to be an anime cat girl and he married her.
how do you play dnd it looks so fun
Grog? Keyleth? Vex?? PIKE!?
I turned into a nuke in one of my games and blew up my party and a dragon :)
Bro why is this comedy gold😂
I don't know why it took me so long to subscribe, I've always loved your content and I would love to see more of your animals especially tostada❤❤ ❤
What happened to Paul jr the turtle? Did he die to the worm crown or penguin
Paul reminds me of Larry from Scarlet and Violet
3:13 I don't think that's the right type of mace 😂😂😂
How do you spell the sheep's name ?
I don't usually comment on videos, but we need more DnD, it was super entertaining   Paul is the definitive MVP by the way
The depression?? 😭
Do another one please
I love i’m the first few seconds of the story you put the critical role crew drinking at the table
I chose my character with what’s cool and what class I am going to use in battle
It was hilarious. Thank you for sharing this story, sharing fun and epic sessions is one of the best part of TTRPG :3
What’s the song in the end? I really like vibing with it
Markiplier: The king of FNAF JaidenAnimation: Queen of Pokémon !
I genuinely started tearing up at 15:02, then stared in disbelief as Ranboo and Charlie started laughing.
Still who turned Paul jr into a sheep is it a lot Lich ?
Pawl looks so much like lary the gym leader
1:40 I just realised that this was a reference to Walmart...woops😅 to be fair, I'm European and I've never been, but still.
OMG ITS D AND D AND MORE D FROM GRAVITY FALLS !!!!!
My first terrible experience is when I was at new day group home we could play DND and so we had the DM mason and my friend Justin and me, i was Batman (ig) and Justin he likes venom and for whatever reason everybody just likes to make it hard to play as superheroes in DND anyways Justin had to have two character sheets for both venom and eddie wich sounds great but that means if venom in general takes damage eddie also has to take damage and with two character sheets that is alot of work for him, my second experience was at school in DND club i wanted to be goku, ofcourse i couldn't turn super Saiyan or anything so I'd basically be Db Goku before Z and that would be the munk build or whatever and when first building it i watched a video for the stats but there was this one girl in our hangout group who was like "nope you gotta role the dice" wich sucked, and before it actually got to anyone playing it was mostly just the other nerds sitting and talking, i knew i should've signed up for band practice but nope i just had to do DND class like my friend brandon so moral of the story don't try anything different just be what they have in dnd and also don't get into it just because your friend did, me personally i find this very boring it sounds good on paper but when executed not so much however it's not bad bad like honestly playing for hours on end as long as everyone has the time and gets along sounds fun but it's not really for everyone either but for those of you who do play and like it i hope that you guy's have fun bye now
That was impressive 🙂
what is your class in D&D
i choose a charectr is the dark slasher cuting anything with one scrach
You need to make more dungeons and dragon vids
did i only see the vox machina reference now??
this, is storytelling .👌
One time when I played d&d we went to a grandmas house and I grabbed a blow touch and started blow tourching her and then my friend pushed her into the pool and then another of my friends (somehow used powers to freeze the pool????) then I found ancient relics and smashed em all and won because we found the totem :D
13:41 was a Naruto reference
You have to play DND again or I will literally hang myself by the neck. This is such a cool series. You should do it more often.
Did anyone see the vox machina reference
ARE WE NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT VOX MACHINA!!! :(
Sorry I meant i plat it in my school
I love D&D i play it is n my school
-12:44 that voice reminds me of something🤔
15:58 What should be the value of the dice for such a possibility to occur :D
And sibling sophia😂
PLEASE DO A PART 2
Pebble is pebble and I feel bad for mark lol
RAMBOOO
so sad jaiden's bird wasn't included
i was also a dragon born on my first do  i feel special now
I'd love to play D&D with someone someday
I’ve never played D and D but this has to be the funniest game I’ve ever seen 🤣
THIS IS MASTERPIECE, and yes I am now addicted
I love your take on a Dragonborn, since normally they’re described as normal creatures with dragon blood or something, but you went full bipedal dragon lizard kid and I’m here for it  Edit: yall I’m just a dumbass, I wrote this like several months ago 😅 I know what a Dragonborn is now
This is why I love DND, whatever Re-DONK-ulous thing happens, you just shrug and go "ok". Asking the turtle the answer to the riddle? Ok.Told to make something with clay and just eat it instead? Sure. have the Middle Manager ask the golbins questions? Yep, checks out.
It just me that can't understand the door face 😭
15:23 I pulled the same kind of stunt before. We went against 4 bug bears and it got down to the last one being badly injured. This one took the guy we needed as hostage and i proceeded to tell him we'll be fine. he was constantly saying how we do not know what we are going up against and i proceeded to tell him we beaten a dragon (we didnt we lost someone and the dragon flew away). I reassured him that we all will leave this place scot-free and how he can join us and such. I rolled a 19 on persuasion and the bug bear rolled a nat 1. As he was putting down the hostage, I burning hands (carefull spell to not hurt the guy we need) and completely annihilated him. My entire party, including the DM, was shocked at what i did all the while i was maniacally laughing because it was so fucking funny. btw my character is chaotic good.
This qas a waste of time.....dumb plot!¡
Me: feeling sad, been scrolling for years)  (Jaiden: appears from no where to cheer me up) ❤
0:53  I love how she just forget the word host existes
The campaign I’m in is crazy the 1st boss there was almost killed my entire party and me a parlised human threw my horse at it 1 shoting the boss yeah very fun
pt 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!plz
This is the greatest thing I’ve ever watched that has been animated
WAIT. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TURTLEE!?
this unironically made me want to play dnd
I play in a DND club and it's so nice to hear someone's stories! I've never met someone in public that actually likes it
vox machina in the inn scene had me screaming THOSE ARE MY BOYS :DDDDDDDD
4:15 some UNKOWN thing here seems... familiar
In dnd I’m a 6”5 gnome wizard
The animation reminds me of The fools gold DND campaign
did no one notice keyleth, pike, grog, and vex from vox machina in the intro???????
HOLY SHIT I ONLY NOW NOTICED THE VOX MACHINA CAMEO
ive seen so many videos about dnd and it looks like so much fun
Penguin!
The vox machina reference was nice
How the conversation probably went in the moment where she turned into the guys ex wife:  Jaiden: Okay so I’m gonna become this man’s ex wife   Dm: what?  Dm: roll, you successfully become this man’s ex wife as he walks over to you to hug you    The guy: it’s been so hard  Jaiden: I’m gonna say sh Sh Sh it’s okay   Jaiden:OKAY SO NOW IM GONNA GO BACK AND POINT BLANK ACID SPRAY HIM   Dm: HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ROLL HAHAHAHAHA 😂😂😂😂  Dm: you succeed 😂😂😂😂😂
We need a pt2
1:15, VOX MACHINA!!!
Mark: I'm gonna become a dark wizard Also Mark: Uses bombs
The fact that zoot is the only one with no beef with anyone🤣😂
What the heck happened to the little turtle?
I am buying dungeons and dragons now
Are you in odd ones out
I think it’s hilarious how Tholomew Luap and Paul have a reason to go on this campaign, and Zoot just joined for sh1ts and giggles.
Mark Thompson literally playing the world’s smallest violin always gets me
"Are you new here?" "I wish I was.."
I loved that oneshot that was actually such a w story
Jaiden is on top for animating Vox Machina 🔥🔥🔥🔥
There is literally a bird people race called aaracocra, so you can play as Ari or Tofuu lol
6:31 How did bro not notice
1:34  im sorry after this scene happened i got an add with "Treat your cat well" TOSTADA?!?! ARE YOU OK?!-
One time me and my friend were the same character trying to defeat the king (huge fail 😂)
Jaiden, you have the best character
I hosted my first DND session last night. The party killed the guy I planned to return next session.
😂
THE WAY I GASPED?
I played Dungeons and dragons with 5 total students and a teacher as the master during summer school (3 weeks) and Watching this video makes me want to play D and D again :(.My team was very chaotic as well. here is the group's name cause why not: Raka: human monk and is clumsy AF (she missed and killed my character by accident), Yavelda (me) A Tiefling wizard who is a strong duo with Lavican who is a elf rouge, Luck who is a barbarian, and finally Leivilhar who is a dragonborn warlock and is the "here me out".
IS THAT THE HORSE COSTUME ICE KING WEARS IN THAT ONE EPISODE IN ADVENTURE TIME 9:51
Dragonborns UNITE!!! Are you chromatic or no?
Also very awesome job at the animation.
Do you still play DnD? And if so, do you play online DnD or know how to do so? And can you please teach my friend, who also has YouTube (Ghoul-o9d), how to play? She's a beginner.
I loved this, I had a good time just listening welcome to the hobby.
9:51 NOOOO THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE
ranboo looks like monokuma
The first time I played DnD, I didn't really know what I was doing and our DM/ my best friend made it very traumatizing. We were stuck in a target for 24 hours with no way of escaping and he refused to speed up the time. We all suffered... then we had a lovely conversation about politics.
And then Thalamu immediately gets put at the beginning of the story cause they never used the wand to take him out of the time loop
1:15 VOX MACHINA REF YIPPIE
I’ve just joined my first D&D campaign and somehow the most stressful part so far is creating myself a character 😂
Wait, I had a DND session just like this last year
Paul jr rjluap
i love how paul is js an average man
I love the Vox Machina reference sm 😭😭
Not we researching for DM’ing my first ever campaign
What Kirby music plays in 8:30
Can you do more dnd campaigns
OMG OMG OMG OMG I LOVEEEE D&D
This is what pushed me to do dnd Edit: this also made me do a Dragonborn
1:12 is that vox machina I see? 🤨
Bro I did a dnd session where I got possessed by a ghost so nearly like being controlled by clay
My name being Ella:   ...😭
You have to make another video on DND seriously it’s the best ever
My first time playing d&d was yesterday and I killed the final boss in one hit by hitting it with a stick and getting a 20 on the dice :)
0:42 aka corn guy if you know you know, and almost everyone knows
As retired dungeon master I just love vids like this.
These are what i think their classes are Paul, barbarian Thalamew, bard Zute, druid
Wow my first dnd experience was full of drinking, gambling and splitting air pirates in half
I loved this video please do it again
3:08 that’s not… that’s not what a mace is…
What dm book did Charlie use (I forgot whay theyre called) cause this is very entertaining, or did he make this up as he went
So, has anyone else noticed half of Vox Machina hanging out in the inn at 1:15 ? Nice easter egg!
i can tell they got alot of 1s
I like D&D and I’m only nine
A year late to this party, but I need to acknowledge the delightful nod to Critical Role at 1:15  I don't see anyone else here who mentioned it, and it gave me a tweak right in fun stuff.  <3
What class was jacob
the music at the end was just... awesome!
Everyone you ever met?😭
THERES NO FUCKING WAY ITS BEEN A YEAR SINCE THIS WAS UPLOADED
i'm playinh my first campaign soon and i aspire to be as chaotic as jaiden ❤
whats the song at the end called?
WHY IS YOUR CHANNEL SO REWATCHABLE I'VE SEEN THIS VID LIKE....  A lot
I wanna learn to plaaaaaaaaaaaaa
16:06 "for the restraining order, for moving in next to me" wait, that's achualy a good way to mess with someone you really hate, so they literately cant help but break the law
What was that end music?
That was probably the most engaging jaiden animation video I’ve seen!
I've watched this video a bunch of times but I've never noticed at the horse at the goblins are cooking is the one from adventure Time
The boss is a wallmart manager lo
Why does super paper mario feel like a d&d campaign with Mario characters.
I want to play D&D so bad.   Like I'm imagining one with She-Ra. Or GATE: Thus The JSDF Fought There.
Intimacy with a ogre sounds awesome
PLZ MaKE ANOtHER VID LIKE THIs
i want to tell you that im an dm but so far im just starting
Me and a few others did something similar to this recently My characters name was Brad Ward (Ryan Trahan reference) and he was a HUGE wild card. Also during this campaign someone became a theifling bard from reading a book about it because wild magic and they could now sing Symphony by Zara Larsson Also Brad Ward lore time! -He hates reading (He can read, he just hates doing it) -He has gotten 50 restraining orders (All of them were from stalking people, all of which women) Back to the campaign, there was a final boss attack that disabled all magic and BRAD WARD WAS UNAFFECTED BECAUSE HUMAN ROUGES DON'T NEED MAGIC YO
ENPOPÜLER
i unsubbed faster than my dad left+ my wifi + every time i heard a sound at 3 am + i love d o d
Imagine a giant mimic transforms into a dungeon near you and when you go in you die
This was amazing man
JUSTICE FOR MARK
8:24 giwi?
This should be a show.
Not how command works but ok
You should do another video like this
It’s complicated and I desperately want to learn it
Zoot reminds me of suzie from deltarune
I wanna know play d&d with you i love being a shadow baby arcane dragon
17:43
I like the adventure time refrens with the horse
SAMU8LBUIŽŘĞŹUL IIKJIOMuukkn jihjrhotz
On my first DnD session, we were looking for a book at the start, I decided to jump on the bookshelf, nocked it over, fell through the window and took bludgeoning damage but it meant we found the book we were looking for.
Y The lore is always crazy jaiden
Ohhhhhhhh 😂😂😂😂
Ohhh
Ur luck is actually crazy jaiden
i've played dnd before
DM: *has no idea on how to start the campaign* Random Inn/Tavern: “Hello There”
1:14 voxxxxxxx
And that was the awfully amazing story of The sane,The depressed and The furry.  Oh and the baa
Why does Paul look like Larry from Pokemon?😂
Love the casual cameo from Vox Machina 😊
Jaidens a Dragonborn I like it ( my favorite race)
I love this game
As a DND creator/DM I love this
That was by far my favorite video. I love it
My freinds made me play and i became a big buff black man and slapped a mushroom into a tree
only now did I realize that in the beginning, we see Vox Machina characters xD
1:14 VOX MACHINA 😮
are you the girl with a cat name tostadas
omg lol D&D has brought out Jaiden's inner monster, pepper spraying harmless sheep, hurling turtles at doors & throwing the sheep to get the branch, wtf were you playing chaotic evil? XD Although I saw that acid blast coming and yes, it was hilarious. Evil, but hilarious. Great game!
Can we get more D&D story?
I <3 D.N.D!!!!!!!!!!!
4:14 is that an ari silhouette??
Remember when the furturn tellers told you you would have 3 kids and be affectionate towards them what if it is the eggs?
3:42  Me: Luap huh? Sounds strangely farmiliar for a name I dont know.  Paul JR: *Sweats profusely.*
Jaiden what class was zoot? Warlock? Sorcerer? Wizard?
My party's first mission was a one shot that had to help a wizard who was turned into a sheep. How did you have the same one?!
I love dnd, will play it soon (also, Jaiden what’s ur favorite color?
Why does Alpharad looks like Larry from gen 9? He really reminds me of his attidute and behavior for some reasons.
I love this so incredibly much.Because my name is paul junior and it's such a rare Occurrence that someone else is paul and a junior So it's nice to see this once at a while
I love d&d
This was amazing😭😭😭
I find it real funny that my name is Paul lol
Welp because this this video I'll try played
I really love this type of video’s!! Please make more in the future 🌸🙌🏽
The clay disappears from Luap's face for a frame.
15:42 snap back to reality op there’s go gravity
OMG D&D IS SO FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
17:11 looked like the mech dragon from dingo doodles dnd series
hay Jaiden did your gm made your campaign homebrew or official dnd  campaign  dnd is best i been play for 2 years
it is sooo fun omg heehehehehe
Lmao I legit played that One-Shot if it's what I think it is
i love all the over the garden wall references!
I LOVED this one as a dnd fan if you enjoyed it could you make more?
Jaiden animations did you know there’s a monster hard to kill the two monsters called SCP 682 the hard to destroy monster and the man in the suit SCP 682 is a monster that never dies The SCP foundation try to kill SCP 682 but they did kill it because it always heals up the man in the suit is a monster that used to be a man, but he was fuse in the Godzilla suit, so who will win SCP 682 or the man in the suit only you can decide who will win SCP 682 vs the man in the suit WHO WILL WIN IN THIS BATTLE
BRO AT 13:37 ITS A NARUTO REFERENCE(Obito/Tobi/Madara did that) 🤩🤯🤯
can we appreciate the legend of vox machina reference in the beginning of the vid!!💗
Peak
Was the cat really put in a time loop or does he just have a really repetitive routine
Darn you PAUL!!!!
SUCH A STORY!!!
I had the exact same reaction at Luap’s name reveal 😂😂
7:12 The poor turtle what did he do he doesn't deserve that He's just a little guy
I have never played dungeons and dragons
3:15 props to Jaiden for actually writing “speak with animals” in draconic
Do part 2 of d@d
I noticed that in the start of the video vox macina is show
I played my first ever game today and LOVED IT there was a person I had to kill and I had a care taker who was a spirit and she shoulded up last minute she came and killed him
Did anyone see 'the beast''
4:30-4:34 i love the Over The Garden Wall refrences
Jaidens narrating skills are underated
8:30 isn’t this the background music in Kirby when you fight king DeDeDe?
i love this omg
😮cool huh 😎
i recently got into dnd and just watching this now and im telling you now i should NOT be trusted as a dungeon master (im good at writing stories but *not* the happy ones..)
“Hmm looks familiar… 4:11”
I once beat a D&D game by just saying   So how did that make you feel  100 confusion damage
1:36  IS THAT LARRY FROM POKÉMON
Mark really said snap back to reality, and Op, there went gravity.
this was soo hxh core 😭
This was fun. :>
Im a dragonborn too, my group found me in an ally in a trash can hiding from a giant
Pt 2 please 🙏
I need a new part for this I also imagine alpha rad makes a new character
i am 9 and play dnd with my dad but that ending is just sad
I play d&d and a witch ate my party that was fun
That's a pretty metropolitan clientele for a hollow oak in the middle of...where is ye olde oake supposed to be, again? I didn't see any heavily trafficked street outside it. Guess that's a moot point after it becomes a post-olde non-oake. No one in there but NPCs anyway.
this was posted...               1 YEAR AGO!? it feels like only a couple months like what
1:18 cat
That was the coolest thing ever! I wanna play dnd but I don’t have friends and no dice…or anything like that…maybe dnd would cure my depression…
The horse those goblins were grilling looks like the horse that Ice Kind dresses up as in Adventure Time..?
I'm already subbed
THE CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE! I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE! I ONLY NOTICED BECAUSE I JUST WATCHED THE LEGEND OF VOX MACHINA!
nice
How have you never played this?
I love how Paul, the normal Mart of Wall manager in a suit, is running around with a giant battleaxe. Peak dnd.
this is a really cool video about dungeons and dragons, and the acid breath moment was too good, that's just for the sake of it, you can learn English (I'm from Russia)
I can't believe it took me this long to realize that in the old oak tavern you get a glimpse of vox machina 😅😅 I love this. 1:16
WAIT I JUST DID THIS ONE SHOT WITH MY GROUP AND SAW THIS AFTER
I've DMed this one shot
Thalu me it's my favorite.
9:13 *ash baby*

So cool
Did they break his time loop????
You should make more of these. It seems like a lot of work tho so if u can’t/don’t want to i understand
Paul is literally Larry from s/v and I love it
DnD = ADHD - The Game
The constant worms is so funny to me for some reason
2:05  OMG IS THAT THE OLD ME🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩

LEGEND OF VOX MACHINA REFERENCCCCE😭😭😭
THE VOX MACHINA CREW OMFG
Only now noticing the Over the Garden Wall reference 4:15
“D and D is very popular.” 💀
Who wants a part two of this
I feel like this would have been better if Jacob and ranboo were voicing their characters and we had Charlie randomly poking in as the dungeon master with a weird echo effect
15:31 absolute perfection 😂
This my first time hearing about this game  what's it' about d and d
Jaiden have you ever started to think about making a Netflix series? When you told the story about you playing the game with your friends, it kinda looks like a cartoon show.
Casual Vox Machina reference... -> 1:14
a fellow dragonborn
i still love the vox machina reference in the beginning
I'm sooo confused... is it a video game? a board game or what??? pls be nice I srsly don't know
Is a vox machina
1:13 MY PEOPLE  Speaking of which, y’all seen Season 3?
Anyone pick up on the vox-Makena cameo in the beginning
not me making a game thats this, but you do LITERALLY ANYTHING.... wait,
Pt 2 please 🙏
Paul was just depressed.

Yo what was the music at the end (this is my third time asking for music lol)
I want to see the full video of this campaign
MORE
15:15 to 15:33  gets romantic &funny
2:10 The Hero/Genloss Ranboo be like
I 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think it’s funny that one of my favorite creators has the same name as me just spelled differently
7:37 This cured my depression.
1:14 Nice cameo.
Vox Machina
Now this sounds super nerdy but I can’t live without D&D It’s the best thing of all time.
I was DMing and I was describing a clearing. I describes a large oak tree, and the bard of the party being a bard decided to flirt with the tree. And they rolled a nat20 which made the tree blush and cover the face the tree definitely had
Ranboo saying ”I wish I was” at the bar is so sad
1:13 I GET THE REFERENCE NOW
I can relate
I love the legend of Vox machina
I want you to do more plus, My big sister loves dnd!! (I thought you were good)
1:14 DUDE IS THIS VOX MACHINA???
w youtuber sub to her
i swear to god if this is the *ONLY* dnd video that actually educates me better than the tutorials 0:40 HE IS?!,
hi should i try to make an animation channel?
Can you do more stuff like this this was amazing
Me before d&d._.  Me after 😮"that was amazing"
So in my public library they do d&d every month and I actually played the ogre story. Staff members from the library host it ITSSS SOO FUN I thought it would be boring but amazing I’m oozing forward to the next one _😆
i love that paul is just Larry from Pokemon
My favorite thing to do in DND is to annoy the DM by making my character do stupid stuff.
5:10 i said the same thing as alpharad “the alphabet backwards”
PART 222!!!!!🎉
Needs a sequel, LOL
well i make D&D so if you want me to make one i willing to help
DND
Words cannot describe how much I love this movie
This kinda reminds me of an ongoing Warhammer40K campaign I've been running on and off for roughly 20years now. It mainly takes place on our made-up planet "Chronika" which is the only place the eponymous substance of "Chronika" can be found (like the Spice of Dune/Arrakis), and it's basically a potent explosive/fuel/DRUG/mutagenic/whatever MacGuffin you want. The battles have mostly been fought between 'Rogue Traderish' Tau+Mercenaries, Pirate Orks, and Plague Marines. Its pretty awesome.
vox machina hanging in the tavern, nice ♥
I remember when i had my first dnd campagin... I was a dragonborn fighter, and well, i swear to god i was the DOOMSLAYER Of Goblins. He literally took a god damn arrow to the head and shoulder, CLIMBED UP a solid 30 FT rock wall. and with reckless abandon, punched a goblin in the head: WHICH EXPLODES FROM HOW HARD HE HITS IT. Then he turns to the next goblin...  DOES THE SAME THING TO THAT ONE. Takes ANOTHER arrow to the head. SURVIVES.  Then proceeds to decimate the ENTIRE ARMY of goblins on the top of the wall... then somehow is still alive.
15:57 somebody rolled a 1
My favorite video
the vox machina cast in the intro? peak.
2:06 "i wish i was"
Isn’t Alpharad’s character just a blonde Larry from Pokémon?
i remember playing this oneshot when me and my friends were about 12, im pretty sure we immediately killed the sheep and ruined the dms day
Guys what's d&d? Video game? Board game? How do i play it
I saw the vox machina reference
1:15 HOLY MOLY ITS THE VOX MACHINA
Omg I'm literally holding my sides with laughter 😂😂
3:14 I love the fact they it actually says "speak with animals"
THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE
So So D&D is a game that u make a story
Deltarune aaahhh team

Me as soon as i saw the ari plush and jacket: *I NEEEEDD ITTTTT 😡 😡*
I love how you added vox mochina it got me laughing
15:58 bro 100% rolled a nat 1

01:00  The Design for that Tree has to be intentional :0 The Placement of the Trunks as well as the Door and The one branch between it's... "Legs" O__o
Bro we are 0:25 sacns in

My mom got tendinitis from sitting for 7 hour playing D&D, I wanna play so bad but I have no one to play with
*inhale* DEPRESSION!!
Lemme unsubscribe 0:33
1:15  IS THAT VOX MACHINA THAT I'M SEEING!?
That was WHOLESOME!!!
My team almost got smoked by 4 goblins and one of us murdered one of the giblins husbands / wife
14:08 “DEPRESSION” is insane 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m an entire year late but DAMN you had a good dungeon master, they can seriously make or break a game and THEY WERE AWESOME
“I look at him with tears in his eyes and proceed to acid blast him point blank” was the most funny thing I have seen in a while
Girl, you need to make another one. Session 2 better be coming out soon.
That was awesome!
14:06 IT’S THE INFAMOUS LINE
I love Jaden telling storys or describing  dungeons and dragons it's so peacefully and her word flow so smoothly, it melts me 🫠🥹
OMG IT VOX MACHINA
This video inspired me to play d&d
We need part 2
Lol when i was playing dnd some other guy wanted to tame a pet dragon but i rolled a 12 on the 12 dice and sliced the dragons head of clean and then he was on the floor in dnd crying and questioning his existence lol.
I did d and d with my friend once and she was the dm and worked demigorgins into it
U shed do more of that cuz that was indeed awesome
1:16 of course she put vox machina in there and i'm here for it
I love the Vox Machina reference
this is the funniest thing i have ever watched.
Love the Vox Machina reference
That was such a great session.   Props to the animators
Paul the warrior.  Zoot the wizard? Thaulemule the bard.
14:08 DEPRESSION
clay
15:08 I just realized the Walmart thing on marks shirt-
9:50 is that the horse from adventure time?
uhhh mumble mumble, the door sounds like our president potato
İ really want more stuff like this
WE MUST GET MARK!!!
Also it is for great content this game :D
I don’t now why but After this Video I want to Play DandD so dam badly it‘s Crazy
DEPRESSION🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow, this game is like dungeons dungeons and more dungeons from gravity Falls
Why at 5:24 did I hear a fart
"HI dad.. *teary emotional voice switches to unserieous squeaky child voice* you friggin thREW me?! TWICE!??!"
great story lmao
my d&d game (by the way I just got into it and this was my first game) so its starts of with a bard aka the dungeon master doing a performance and plays there best song me being the kind person I am gives them a penny and my other friend a goblin also known as (this  name by the way was a joke but then became there name) potatooo decides to give them two penny's but as soon as he trys a robber steals it so we go after him and lose home we decide to take a break at a local bar except me and the bard didn't realize that potatooo was drunk and loved tequila ended up in the bards drunk pet squirrel dying (cause the squirrel tried to drink the broken glass bottle from a bar fight that happened between me and potatooo) so after traveling we get to a pet store ending up getting a drunken wolf I wanted to get a mushroom cat but ended up with nothing and then we ran into the person that took our money and decided to fight him and me being an elf fairy archer decided to shoot a bow and arrow as potatooo lit it on fire ( he's a goblin/wizard)and so as we defeated the enemy we sang fireball and the bard just sat there laughing and at one point I think before  the bar fight potatooo sayed tequila (and this is how the bar fight happened) we were getting drinks from the bards mom and I spat mine out my nose cause I was laughing and then the bard did the same thing and we got yelled at and had to finish the game outside but yeah that was my story on my first d&d game
this felt like a freaking movie
Imagine your wife leaves you and you train to become an awesome wizard only for a geryish purple dragon to pretend to be your wife before PUKING BASICALLY STOMACH ACID AT YOU😭😭
Adventure time horse?
Wat is d&d 0:56
9:51 it’s the horse from adventure time! The one that was secretly the ice king in disguise!
Was that vox machina??
next time play 40k
The saddest moments quickly turn in to the funniest moment
Can you play again?
this is my fav jaiden aniamtions video ever
What’s that music playing at the end as the gang leaves? Is it mario?
"Ah yes, D E P R E S I O N." Anyways very interesting story :)
Dude I was in dungeons and dragons and my race was a dragon born and it was black bruh. 😅
Just realized my 5th grade counselor made a group and i was in it we had a child frendly d&d game i just figured it out
"Perception check please" "Nat 20 let's go!"
This video made me a dnd head
Loved the clay room! Good vid!
is that fucking roar of dedede
Slimecicle is the person i LEAST expected to be the dm
2:07 "Born and raised! 😃"  "I wish I was 😔"
This is amazing
“The group for some reason decided to all start eating the clay” next thing yknow they grow a mouths on there hands,start infusing chakra in the clay, and making bombs
I love how the DM and Thomamew??? Broke character to laugh at the point blank mouth blast 😂
Great video keep up the good work
I love DnD! I got bullied by a pie during my first time playing! It was great! Glad you enjoy it too!
DnD is peak actually
Paul is a legend apperantly
The psychics were right a man did approach her 1:29
0:50 idk why, this just feels like a Cuphead reference.  Oh btw I'm about to start a DND campaign of my own and my character is based off of Megumin from Konosuba so. But yeah, awesome.
i love the wall of mart
NO WAYS IM CURRENTLY RUNNING THIS ONE SHOT HAHAAHAH
2:7 born and raised! Him: "i wish i was" Epic😂
5:04 I love the awkward “I’m a riddle door” so much. I use it every time a riddle [insert item here] appears in one of my one shots
The Goblin design was awesome
Average day in florida.🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
Vox machina showed not surprised 😂
1:15 I understood that reference
15:30 Aro acid blast
4:10 Camman18’s worst nightmare
I based my first dnd oc off zoole:)
Jaiden believes her powers are animation but its really storytelling
15:48 he can't catch a break
Jaiden didnt mention that that they were eating the clay for like half of the stream😂
15:30 all I’m gonna say is that I expected it
i discovered dnd from MAGIC THE NOAH
“Turtle” 👹
THIS WAS AN AMAZING ADVENTURE. Thank You Jaiden & Team! The Acid Point Blank Got Me LOL
Part 2 pls
2:25 the dragon
The horse is from adventure time
we used to have dnd club in school, i miss it
Blud did the AUUUGH meme 9:10
Blud did not have to yap about his life 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 1:38
...I need to play. Now.
Luap
When I played I made it interesting by making it last a few months but now I am the DM for the first time and now I am excited thanks for the ideas
You must make a series!!
I played D&D ones 0:02
i want more, jaiden MAKE MORE OF THIS PLEASE, TAKE WHAT YOU WANT BUT MAKE MORE PLEASE!
Does anyone know the song she uses at the end?
We just started like last week and someone already has 2 baby dragons and someone else turned into a tiger
15:32 *Bursts out laughing*
Try Minecraft just a suggestion, It would be so cool❤❤❤ also your videos are sooooo cool I love them all but I was born the year you made your first video sooo, sorry for not being there for your first video I didn’t even know about YouTube when I was 8 but when I was 9 I knew sooooooooooooo you get it right I just want to say your videos are the best also if I make a YouTube video I’ll tell you have a great day❤
I’m moving to describe my D&D character very coming up for a long time. He is a 5 foot 7 inches dragon like jaiden with fang’s and go up to the Lip part up onto his upper lip. He has more of like a skirt but not pink it’s black and it has little cut outs pants and he he has wings. He can fly very good part about him. His eyes are bright, white, no color and in the dark they do turn like red so it’s kind of creepy but it also very cool. He does not have horns. Unfortunately I’m sorry I’m sorry I know but he does have like her doesn’t have curly hair but he has a certain way he has his hair. His hair is done with like I’d say scribbled out when you wake up in the morning but like he has like a little Viking braids on the back of his hair. He has a long sword I say around the size of ichigo’s sword and also what are the big weapons he has Walmart it’s not big it’s just a little something he uses now and then dark magic. He has dark magic. Also Pyro kinesis that’s not his only weapon the big sword he has a knife obsidian blade with a chain that’s wrapped around his wrist. I was like scorpions get over here move but he doesn’t use it like that. It’s poison on the blade so he inject people with it. It’s kinda basically a stinger, but it’s not like a wasp or bee stinger. It does not go into them, and just stab them while it has like serrated edges, so when it comes out it like tears where it was so like the edge of the blade is double on bladed so when it comes out it like cuts, the sides were the knife punctured, and basically all know it does that, but Morley is poisoned on every single speck of it also like the curves where the tiny little hooks of the edges on the double sided knife and he has the body of a bodybuilder and he has like a scar across like going down on his right eye. Also since he’s super jacked, I feel like it’s only right to give him black and red armor. What’s the best color, black lines and then red insides. Are you are the ones like and like if there’s like a circle is at the black lions created on the armor, there’s going to be red inside so what do you think?
Mark being the manager of walmart and vanished his true fake form into a worm. Me after watching the whole video:😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀
can we just mention ranboo being monokuma from danganronpa
Thought this was gonna be a run of the mill DND campaign. I was right. Good fun!
love your vids
We need a continuation of this story
i just remarked the fact that vox machina is here
the vox machina refrence at 1:14 haha
Bro how do you play dungeons & dragons before me?! I didn't even know it yet
Paul be reminding me of a blonde Larry (gym leader in Pokemon Scarlet & Violet)
I'm sorry but at the start of y'all didn't notice, those who are aware of critical role, you can see Vox mocina in the inn. This was Soo great
9:13 “AUUUUGGGHHH”
It’s official, “so long, gay bowser” is now a verb
ive done it one, i was impaled into a tree after trying to drop kick a tree god and being bitched slapped left hanging
I wanna try D&D now
*Paul Jr.*  "TuRtLe!"
We all gotta love how come alpharads character is based off Larry
Consume the clay for the puzzle and then more clay just drops in from the ceiling 😂
9:13
5:23 did I hear a sloppy fart after that blast?
Can you try out dragón ball sparking zero and give us your opinion on how it was because I like listening to other people opinions/review 😊
I have never played Dungeons and Dragons before. *But now I want to.* Jaiden, if by some miracle of God you see this comment, I have a question. There are a couple different D&D starter packs, do you have a recommendation? or know a dude who has a recommendation?  the moment when I realize I'm asking a YouTuber ive been watching my whole for board game recommendations. Love your content Jaiden! please answer.
Omg grog from that show I've watched
Paul looks like Draco Malfoy
OMFG JAIDEN YOUR DND SONA LOOKS LIKE MY DRAGONSONA YUUKI/MYTH WHAT ?Q?!?!?!?!??!?!
I remember the first time i first played dnd it was a school made campaign and it was so damn fun
Jaiden, do you watch Vox Machina?? 😂
that worked out better than most DnD campaigns
Beginner:I chose my character based on my personality Veteran:I am a frog who swallowed a piece of cheese which uses mage hand to carry myself
1:15 AYOO VOX MACHINA?!?
So I can think of you letting the eggs hatch what your birds laid
I thought this was an here Johnny game
My character is kinda similar to yours soooo wanna join a digital d&d thing (idk what to do I wanna play d&d with you)
the actual diary of a wimpy kid reference.
Moreeeeeeeeeeeee! Pls
my first dnd character was a Warforged Monk named Ignus Xenithus that had an uncountable amount of near death experiences but fortunately the DM gave me plot armor and every other player too.
😊
Why did I think dungeons dungeons and more dungeons from gravity falls
Me know now how to play d&d
I see vox machina
Oh boo hoo let me play a sad song on the worlds smallest 🎻
alpha ride Ashley made Larry
La wap
I’m also a dragon born 😁
Am I the only one seeing Horse from Adventure Time?
What did I just stumble upon lmao 😂
The story is amazing, but the animation is priceless ❤
This was funny af
Voxmocenre
Wow. Thats some serious D&D hijinks!
I NEED ANOUTHER ANIMATED D&D
This is A Wild Sheepchase by Winghorn Press! :)
why did the pat where she yells "depression" bring up the "blows up pancakes with mind" meme in my brain
THIS WAS EPPIICCCC, I NEED MOREEE
Im gonna steal this campaign
LOL, that was too good! I would love to see another video like this one!😂❤
The corn guy!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG, i love It jajjajajaja ❤❤
Jadon Via
This video so funny 🤣
I love the vox machina reference at the start😂
We need more people
Why did larry die his hair blonde
Why is Jaiden's hair colour a lighter brown in this video?
LITERALLY ZERO DISLIKES. H O W
Clearly this was the next step for you if you low-key cameo Vox Machina 🍻Sounds like a blast of a session!
I want a video all about what Jaiden rolled and how bad that went 😭
Cool
Mark honestly doesn’t seem like a bad guy
I like paul <3
My cousin recently got me into D&D and I asked my friend if we could play and he said yes so……. Pray for me because I am new.
Why does mark have a Walmart logo on his shirt 13:08
4:57 WHAT IN THE AUNT MAY ON A CHRISTMAS STICK
My name is Luaaaaah” 3:40
I’ve never played it but we I heard my friends had this guy “agarinatar person
Anyone here in 2024?? 👇
5:30 was that a reference to piemations tf2 series?
The aroace playing a Dragonborn, fish in the ocean
Ella Lodge
Yost Summit
Windler Landing
Kulas Mountain
15:28
The wheel and candle being a loading circle and lightbulb is SO SMART cause those things didn’t exist in this time period
I hope you do this again for the 1 year anniversary of your DND adventure!
I can’t tell what Class Jaiden is, but I assume it’s a Druid based on the fact she could shape change
We want a turn based rpg like this
Now imagine that these guys have the Game Master as Magic the Noah.
So the treasure was Gold, Emerald, and Ruby. 🤔  ... Best pokemon games ever.
1:16 love seeing vox machina make an appearance in a Jaiden video
I don't think Mark Thompson was the villain of that story.
THIS WAS SO GOOD
So pual therw his own son?!
I played dnd with a friend and i had another friend who made this skeleton character and there was a ton of skeleton enemies, we pretended every skeleton was their long lost cousin and proceeded to massacre all of them
Critical role reference is awsome
Jaiden is such an incredible storyteller!  This video is amazing!
love this, always loved dnd
I love playing D&D it is the best
Zulauf Cliffs
0:26  the face!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Edit : thx to everyone who liked! I’m surprised I even got likes on a comment.
If I was there I would have kicked down the Riddle door
Is it okay to steal parts of other people campaigns if you still mess with them to make it diffrent?
I am about to play my first DsD with my friends next week bro I can not wait I am excited (even thought this is my first game I have like 20 cubes)
5:08 riddle and answer had me dying
Part 2?
that one moment were flowey thinks you're about to spear him: 15:28
Who's that cat
Beatiful campain
The cat Is my favorite
I love the creepy adventure time horse
7:57 *builds a fucking A10 thunderbolt*
Yeees! Vox machina!❤❤
4:13 is it just me or does this sound a little like the dragon roost island soundtrack
This is the video that got me into dnd
Most chaotic thing i have ever seen in my life😂😂😂😂
Me and my parents love dnd
ANOTHER EPISODE!!!!!!
Slime fits his roll
Dragonborns have tails now :D
I go for the 22 honestly
That one gumball episode:
2:39 when I heard the Mario music, I knew stuff was about to go down
I’ve tried to play dnd but I was never able to find people who I can play with.
we NEED a pt 2
THE CRITICAL ROLE CAMEO!!! ❤
WHY IS RANBOO ALWAYS THE MAIN CHARACTER????
I think i get it, i will Play it tomorow
Ranboo and charlieee
this video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
Boyle Greens
7:50 the last time Paul gr (the turtle) was seen
What campain did you use? It would be so chaotic with my friends
make it real Jaiden Animations the Anime go
Thoughts here                  👇🏽
I love the character designs in this, especially Jaiden's, it's soo cool, the sigil is a cool detail. 10/10  I have watched this 6 times in one day now
i seen this game in gumball ha ha
hi, dnd person here, it's wild, i called you gotta love a game where you can call satan 'poop shoveller'
DEPRESSION!!!!!!!
15:49 do yall know what plays here? I want it on my playlist but the description just says all the music was made by nintendo :/
"Did i hear Ronmbo"
1:13 Critical role detail...
I love how a "casual" conversation is "stares into soul" "do you know Mark?"
Geoffrey Vista
I love D and D 10/10 would recomend. My session had a weird connection to the mafia and ended in disaster
I just rewatched your vid after playing some DnD too (i love it) and i love the reference to Vox Machina!
cool game 😊
I was playing wolfquest while I listened to this and at 15:29, one of my pups whimpered. :3
There are two types of people in this world,  the ones who are empathetic   and then the ones who acid blast someone in the face after empathizing with them
Warning: DO NOT seduce an ogre, they are ugly af in dnd
That was really fun. I think I heard about this adventure but never played it. Well a second spoiler actually doesn't makes it worst so it doesn't really matter. Your game was absolutely enjoyable and I love the how it went.
Make a sequel of this game.
Guys, if I ever get milions of subs and maybe get into properly playing DND in the future... Remind me to never fight against Jaiden XD
Is this wrong me I find it funny that Paul threw Paul junior when he was a sheep
VOX MACHINA!!!
You just had to cast depression
You should check out Legends of Avantris, they make D&D content and it's sooo funny, in my opinion
Bro one of my friends rolled to seduce a gate in dnd AND IT WORKED LOLLL
Ranboo kinda looks like Monokuma
Larry Junctions
I just realized Paul so long gay bowsered his own son and he didn’t even break his fall😅
“So Paul so longe bowsers the sheep into the air” is the best line ever it cured my fever
9:51 adventurer time reference
Peep Vox Machina at 1:15!!!!!
i had a funny moment where i was chasing a shady guy and my companion a dwarf kept getting from nat 1 to nat 4 or 5 and failing every possible dodge while i had a perfect record
I only know d&d because of young sheldon😭
3:38 Tak ahh moment
4:10 I really like the detail of the birch having a subtle eye print it’s cool
I really want to see more adventures with Zewt they’re a really good character and just anymore d&d stories would be great
I thought this was the campaign with the sheep wizard and the final boss is a dragon made up of bed and curtains
4:33 look I trying to cope with the lost of my son okay
Prosacco Rest
Bernadette Stream
pls part 2
I joined a DnD club at school and so far I’ve been shot into a random dome in the middle of the desert while in a red bus
What is the song at the end I really like it.
chat ive played this one lol
Rogahn Mountain
Kuvalis Meadow
How i thoight is was gponf to go foen when tneu cast DEPRESSION on Mark: "The spell has no effect"  "Muahahah, you fool!  You think that can hurt me?  I've had depression this whole time!"    Also, I love that you used so-long-le-bowser as a verb.  Lol.   This whole thing was just deliciously delightful shenanigans all throughout.  I loved it!
Funniest ending ever
Dude I tried the zebra riddle on my friends but in turkish girraffe means "zürafa" and I was confused when they answered me with "zürafa"
This is EPIC and hilarious!
Arvilla Throughway
Royal Run
Ok I’m not trying to be wierd or anything but 0:25 HAHHAHAHAHAH
Gorczany Creek
I loved this video 💯
Lew Pike
The windwaker tune is perfect... The box machina cameo as well❤ The Beast cameo🤩
I’m upset Zoot’s little bird familiar wasn’t represented in this
What's the name of that last song?
I ALMOST DIED LAUGHING LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Jaiden is the type of person to roll multiple 20s and lose
Why are you doing so fun and all with guidelines in your commddng while your mocking god just like thst
Bro "Depression" cast is deadly asf😭😭
We need character sheets for these characters
Shut up yall My movie started
I love the little detail of Vox Machina seating in the tavern❤❤
0:35. Ok I’ll unsubscribe
Poor mark lol
This was an awesome video! I hope you do another one soon!
My first time playing we fought a dragon but we couldn’t win so i rizzed up the dragon and took the treasure 😂
1:15 is that vox Machina
Well this certainly was a more wholesome first DnD experience than mine. My party met at an inn, thought we are broke beyond compare, decided to kill a halfling, I stole his organs, then we barely survived an orc attack. Good times.
Zoot Legit Looks like Susie from deltarune. ESPECIALLY at 2:24
She is going places, first sesión and already comiting war crimes
5 min in, door say Z to A, i stuff pizza in my mouth and jokingly say zebra...door says zebra haha i choked
do you like over the garden wall cause i keep seeing references in videos
Inumaki reference 😮
Please teach me
4:33 look at all those Over the Garden Wall references. It makes me so happy
IDK if anyone notices it but in 5:23 when the door turns Paul (Alpharad) into a zebra there is a flushing down the toilet or pooping audio meme from the internet. I just thought this was a funny fact while I'm just enjoying Jaiden animation :D
I love animated d&d stories if you could I would love to see more PS love the story that you did that was hilarious
Medhurst Shoals
i’m still laughing at “ye old mart of wal”
What are rad session I'm definitely going to steal that
If u watch this video rn and u see paul u will see the larry within him
I love DND. I once played a Goliath fighter, and somehow, i got an AC of 24, and I was unkillable. My dm hated me. I made fun of every monster he threw at me😂😂😂
14:07 dealing with the purple soul in undertale be like:
I love the music choices.
Did anyone notice the vox machina characters at 1:15
4:56 freaking bards man
0:24 freaking bards man
This is my favorite Jaden vid❤❤❤
damn how was this nearly a year ago i remember watching this the day it came out
Guiseppe Extensions
I looooved this video!! I hope to see more like this🦜✨
The first game I ever dm'd for my friend group was A Wild Sheep Chase so its kinda crazy that you guys first game ever was the same ❤❤❤
This was amazing, we need more! Also the full session is also fun to see?
I love the Vox  Machina reference 😂
should totally do more DND, already know how to animate, so funiest moments would be very possible to share.
9:51 NO ICE KING IS FUCKING DEAD
I have had some stupidly fun campaigns. Some really funny stuff went down in my room. (video idea?) Really nice to see Jaiden start to plunge into the hilariously broken world that is D&D!
There is this one time I played Dungeons and Dragons with my friend it was pretty fun but we had to use paper and a box Cube to play it but it was still pretty fun
This was the first Jaiden video I ever watched :D
i thought this was such a heartfelt moment 15:25 until.....
Waters Flat
0:34 she failed the charisma check 😂
Pretty cool that this is a heavily modified version of the “Wild Sheep Chase” module.
Challenge: Make a character without trauma
15:22 😭
these are just the characters I would expect from a chaotic one-shot
ADDING VOX MACHINA AT THE BEGINNING WAS GENIUS
Please please do another of these! So great
LOVED the Vox Machina Reference!
Holy hell this was one crazy emotional roller-coaster
I didn't like the door voice . Its hard to listen to what it says
honestly, paul  carried the story
Mark wasnt even a villian hes a victim.
the way i yelled when i heard the toon link music track that plays on the island in the legend of zelda: the wind waker  THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD
Zebra was my guess :D
Me casts Avada Kdavra
Great channel!
So Paul “SO LONG YE BOWSERED” Lob  12:37
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
Dude is playing D&D as Larry XD
I love the vox machina refrense
Jaiden's first character was a Dragonborn  Jaiden, I welcome you to the Dragonborn Gang
You should watch the owl house
We need more dnd jaiden
RANBOO IS IN THE VIDEO, HE PLAYS DND?
RAMBOO AND CHARLIE
my first time playing dnd we were nearly wiped because everyone kept rolling way too low
14:12 I miss my wife tails... I miss her so much...
the kirby music chosen for this video is 10/10
And Paul scolded Paul Jr. for his behavior in the inn as they all walked back, happily. (Except Paul, because Paul can't be happy)
11:27  usee..... AIR SLASH
My dnd character was a raging alcoholic and i got god roles during drinking contests. Would drink you to the floor but ny attack rolls werent so good. I guess the alcohol came back to haunt me 😅
Does anyone else want to see them do a live dnd?
MORE
Seeing you draw Ranboo made my heart rate spike and i literally gasped then stared at that image for like a minute  This is my first time having a crush this big
And then the dragon incinerates them👍
Also i acualy am one of the cofounders of the dnd club at my school and one of the longest running members
I saw the thunmbnail and then saw Ranboo and i instantly clicked on it i have a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge crush on Ranboo and just hearing his voice makes my day so much better
I want to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨

PLEASE Do tHIS AGAINnNNnnNN
Love the vox machina lil head nod. Hell yeah
This is a great twist of a wild sheep chase! Very fun!
I am just gonna say it, this would be a amazing book 😂
The amount of critical failures in this video is absolutely amazing😅
I was the same I have never played it and I only searched it a month ago because I thought it would be fun.
Love the grit roll shoutout!! Awesome 👏
I’m actually going to learn how to play Dungeons and Dragons tomorrow, wish me luck 😅
with that introduction, new sub obviously
I love how the pack of goblins are cooking the horse from adventure time. 9:50
aaaaaaaahhh more of this!!! ever since your pokemon one, i have secretly been like this would be great with dnd. and you just DID it!! SO HYPED
You should just keep doing d&d videos I love them
Am I the only one that didn’t even register Jaiden did a sub plug for the first time
12:18 using the mario rpg battle theme is such a good choice for the team attack and for some reason i love you more for using it.
What's your name?  Paul  No like your avatar's name  just Paul
Please do more of this
Numb
GILLION!!!I love Carlie! Btw I just played it like 45 minutes ago.
4:14 why one of the shadows reminds me of fuecoco
“DEPRESSION!”
I ran this exact one shot as my first game!
Aaaayyyyy critical role cameo
I am a plasmoid lever 4 fighter
I need more Jaidenanimations dnd
vox machina mentioned😭🫶🏼
“I wish i was” bro really has been going through something
4:56 AnSwEr Me ThEsE rIdLeS tHrEe AnD tHeN yOu CaN cOmE iN                   Only real JaidenAnimations fans know this throwback
7:40 tasty cookie
I SAW THAT VOX MACHINA CAMEO
I’ve always wanted to do this
So based on the sheep being pauls son that means he threw  his own son twice at the wall
Laup beign paul jr was great for the story
When I saw the sheep with the scroll I immediately went "waiting a minute this is from wild sheep chase one-shot"   The rest, not so much but I love it!!!!
Why was the beggining with paul yoshikage kira tho??
How did I guess Zebra...
15:28 LOL THAT WAS UNEXPECTED LOL IM DYING OF LAUGHTER
8:23 its wormin time
I always thought I would love D&D but I never had anyone to play with until I met my theater friends and it was my first time playing last week and it was so fun and crazy.. my friends trying to rizz up npc's and other players XD
I love you put Walmart manager on Mark 😂😂😂
Perfect game👍
1:14 I saw the Vox Machina reference and almost exploded
9:13
4:15 the beast
I love how jaiden is like a kobold and it matches her so well
Bro, yeet his own son
4:15 THE BEAST
I cant believe jaiden put the vox machina crew in the first part of the video. POGGG!
0:57 I love how Jacob's just Larry
What was your class
15:23  BAHAHHAHA
Bro, that was the most epic and awesome D&D story i’ve ever heard
I don't understand english, but that's funny 👍
Hey I love your dragon jaden can I make an inspo character of the dragon?
what class did Zoot use?
Jaiden got inumaki’s cursed speech
Looks like an adventure time episode
this is AMAZING. PLEASE MAKE MORE!!! i was so engaged the whole time!!
I was laughing the whole time lol (Mainly since of the Walmart manager uniform lol)
THIS IS MY FAVORITE VIDEO EVER
"D&D is like a board game, without the board" Me, an avid grid user:  >:C (this is a joke, everyone play how they want)
Would love to see more!!!
This really is the average D&D experience, lol. I’ve made some crazy campaign memories myself 🙃 ✨
the best part of this game is when the worm said "IT'S WORMIN' TIME" and wormed all over the screen
Omg jaiden talking about D&D
They "so long bowser" the sheep. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Random appearance of Vox Machina in a tavern....seems legit...lol
4:20 MY HEART LOL
“It’s wormin’ time!”
groundhog day reference at the beginning
Is it possible to have Dr. House, Forest Gump and Genghis Khan in DnD?
9:53 ITS THAT HORSE THAT ICE KING USED AS A COSTUME WHAT
4:33 JOJO REFERENCE!!!
Jaiden playing D&D is extremely wierd
Found this at 1am and just decided to watch
1:15 that's Vox Machina ! :)
Tru
in a dnd rip off game called bmw "burgers month wagons" made by my classmates and i (we didnt really know how to play the game so we just did what we thought we were supposed to do) all i did was sit down and i beat the entire game bec i keep rolling a 6 somehow (we used pencils)
It would have been more comedic if you reveal the roll values on critical or failed attempts😂
Just wanna say I’m so happy to see how much your channels grown in just a short amount of time❤❤❤ your doing great 👍
please play again this was awsome
I love that Alpharads character is a guy working a 9-5 job.
And the vox machina reference in the inn lol
Paul literally yeeted his sheep son twice
Love how you start off the story with outset island theme from wind waker! I immediately screamed HOI!!!!!!
Bro my character was a half orc that could make tea cus it was funny and I would offer it to everyone but it tasted like horrible tea with a taste of orc so uhhhh yeah😅
Bro Mahraga defence isn’t really any better cause it doesn’t change your size like the only reason why his defence is so high, even if you’re talking about him having the same defence no matter the size the other choices would be way better
Ok guess I’m under subing
It looks exactly as one of my dream
9:13  worm😫
Ahhahaha i love paul
Naming a turtle mr president. This is the 3rd time i am watching this video and only now do i find this jojo reference
So how about the turtle?
DEPRESSION I was laughing if you cast that spell on me nothing would happen 🥹
DnD is for nerd’s……..I play DnD I’m a nerd 😅
So…how many Nat 1s did you roll that session 🤔
Old Oak Inn? More like Old Oak Common, am I right, Londoners?
WHEN I PLAYED DYD MY FIRST TIME I SELECTED THE SAME CHARACTER AS YOU, BLACK DRAGON WITH ACID
Oh that’s amazing, I love that 😭 cheers to Paul and Paul.Jr
Longest cutscene in history
15:31 “ acid blast point plank”me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Omg! RANBOO!!
I play dungeons and dragons I killed a plant🌻
I love this video so much but even though Mark was made up I still feel kinda bad for him lol
vod?
Mark thought he part of the akatski
PAUL JR!!!! ❤❤❤❤ I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING!!!
No but seriously why did you try to pepper spray the sheep?
My character is Jeff all physical stats are max and he dose 100 pushups 100 squats and a 10 k run
I am BIG on the DSMP crew so when ranboo and Charlie came up in the vid my eyes went so bug XD
This was so fun and awesome, I hope we could see more like this!
Bro once when I played dnd I ended up getting a pet Cthulhu
How many likes for pt 2?
It worked on me for the first time and I just pressed subscribe button( I guess I really love D&D)
Play more of dungeons and dragons
“Can you use it in a sentence” I lost it
VOXMACINA
"Born and raised" "-I wish I was"  Is so funny to me
Not hate just a mild annoyance 11:55 had the perfect opportunity to say sapphire like Pokémon ruby , sapphire and emerald
4:13 OMG IS THAT AN OVER THE GARDEN WALL REFERENCE!!!
Ok I appreciate the fact that Alpharad’s ‘normal person’ character is Larry. You gotta love the overworked hopefully not underpaid worker type representation :D
DEPRESSION!
Very confused how sheep/lambs are just popping up in dbd so many times bc me and my team were on a planet sheep go bahhhhhh all at once just doing a circle dance around  one sheep one of my team members attack one of them with thunder wave I think the sheep in the middle freaking k1lls him by just looking at him and all his bones broke violently and he just turned in to acid so idk why sheep/lambs are just very powerful or so magical lol
Who would have though pure incompetence could be so endearing <3
So, if this was your first DnD and you went through all this drama, who was there writing all these details down? I figure it'd be pretty immersive breaking to be taking notes while playing :P
You did tell me to unsub.... so I did      Then I re-subbed :P
Homebrewing a Depression special attack on your character in the first DnD session is class. Jaiden fits right in
1:16 the orange haired lady looks like Tauriel from the hobbit...
Just her personality and funny way to deliver a story was enough for me to give a sub,keep up the good work! 🎉
Paul is so relateable :'3
I can’t wait to see the epic saga of… whatever this DnD session is called part 2 someday!
Just wait till nux says "our first time playing dungeons and dragons"
7:56 Rip techno
I need more
I am whatching this for the 5th time and I just got that at the start its vox machina
why the da hell i started laughing at  03:29 and didn't stop till the end lmao
0:23 Crazy
Vox Machina woooooooo!
NO
I once 360 noscoped the boss using an eldritch blast. My friend also successfully rizzed up a red dragon... for some reason.... Another story of mine is that one of my friends decided to become super gay and assaulted every man he could see. (What the frick dude)
I'm in a dnd Campaign. I'm a silly little goblin named frang (the baby eater) who has a silly little pet ret named hank (the Gravy eater)
10:03 omg it's the guy!! The thing from adventure time when ice kind comes out of the horse I never noticed that!!!
This was great
ACID SPRAY!!!!!!!!!!! love it
1:17 vox gang :)
My favorite moment was when the worm said, its worming time, and tried worming on everybody
over the garden wall
Paul is Larry
The  original D&D campaign is called "A Wild Sheep Chase", you can find it online to play with your friends :))
I'm just casually watching this animation and SUDDENLY a wild Vox Machina appears.
I unsubscribed
Wall Mart also happened in a campaign that I was in.
One of my favorite DnD stories was in my first campaign and I completely destroyed a hallway to block off some enemy’s but then we had to go down that hallway so as a joke I suggested that “I would hit the wall so hard it undoes the first hit” and the dm sighed and told me to roll it and I then got a nat 20 so he let it happen and from that point forward I could (theoretically) heal things with a giant hammer
I’m loving Vox Machina just casually at the tavern at the beginning. What a way to start!
1:21 cats cant drink milk because they would die 👍
1:12 VOX MACHINA!!!
love the cameo of the critical roll C1 characters 1:12
Alphrad is nanami
paul looks like larry from pokemon sv
Come on down,and try some corn.or we will sacrifice your new born HEY-
4:33  was  "Mr President(one of the names for the turtle)  a jojos reference
Can someone tell me the link to the actual video
I need friends to play dnd with 😭
WE ALL SERIOUSLY NEED MORE IF THIS !@!!!! OH WOWWOWOWOOWW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <><<<<,333333333333
So wanted jaiden to suplex mark
I play D&D it’s the reason I want to watch this video :)
i subscribed to feed the ego lol
15:29 killed me
respect to the grog and pike getting hammered and keyleth probably being misunderstood by vex 1:15
DND is cool but Warhammer 40k is like a much more brutal and stupid version and maybe you should try it sometime!
16:00 I don't think that's how physics works
9:47
i love d and d jaiden👻👺👹👽💀👿🤘
Zoot just out here living their life when they met some main characters.
As a man who never played D&D ever, this makes me wanna play now.
why does mark look like the pringles guy
This makes me wanna play D&D for the first time.
3:45 THEATRE KIDS RISE we'll be dancing again!
9:13 see for your self.
The Mark Thompson caught me off guard (and luap too:D)
high fantasy is everything to me <3
JAIDEN!!! DROP ANOTHER DND VIDEO AND MY LIFE IS YOURS !! ‼️‼️🗣️🙏🙏
16:52 made me feel dump😮
16:53 make me feel dump😊
Anyone know the name / Kirby game that the song at 8:12 is ?
4:15 THE BEAST IS UPON US/ref Over the Garden Wall is peak entertainment
The two most out of pocket lines are, "Spot follows behind and shouts, 'DEPRESSION!!'" and "Spot pulls back, just a bit,Just to looks into mark's eyes, witch are sparkling with tears,And PROCEEDS TO ACID BALST HIM-"
Wait where can I watch the actual tabletop version? Or this just jokes (wicked good anime)
1:16 just casual critical roll reference
What's the song playing at the end?
Turning into his wife is evil
13:41 did he just pull an Obito? Bros literally in Kamui 🐁🌻🍄
I wanna learn how to play dnd now, your guy's game seemed very intresting.
16:11 that line goes hard
Marks crimes, -Filing a restraining order against a person who hates being near him -Passing up someone for a promotion for no malicious reason whatsoever.  -Moving to an area next to someone who doesn't like them -Thats about it. He really didn't do much wrong and seemed like a reasonable guy. JUSTICE FOR MARK.
its worming time baby
The moment you said “if you don’t think that sounds fun unsubscribe” i subscribed xd
Waiiiit.... Did Father Paul throw historie son Paul Jr?
the rant by alpharads character at the start reminds me of kira
Don't think I didn't see the Vox Machina reference in the beginning Jaiden
Dog
why does Paul look like Draco Malfoy 💀
This is genuinely interesting
10 months before I notice the vox machina reference... damn
To this day i want a Paul in my party
"The oak was turning into birch" camman18's worst nightmare
wait... THIS IS THE STORY OF THE DRAGONLANCE CHRONICLES
Me either
3:47 the sheep is the son
Point blank is the funniest thing I have ever seen
1:15.. nice.  sounded like there were a lot of critical fails in the session :)
DEPRESSION!!! 😂😂😂😂
The fact that Alpharad is drawn like Larry from pokemon is hilariously funny to me
never played d&d but having some guy known as the goop goblin being your dm has to be either the worst or the best way to play
dugeon an draegon
Love seeing the beast from over the garden wall there
5:22 was that a fart sound effect?
Legend of vox machina reference 1:16
Wow, two plot twists, the one where Mark and Thompson are the same person, and the other where Luap is Paul Jr.
Paul reminds me of Larry from scarlet and violet
This got me into dnd! Thank you for showing me this!
Erm actually🤓👆 Ranboos character is a Tabaxi, not  just a cat. 👆👆👆
3:07 look at them😊
This was such a wonderful video!
1:16. I feel like such an idiot for only now realizing that Vox Machina was in this video. 😅
*subscribes* your welcome!
0:24 this made me continue watching💀🙏
Hey Jaiden how did it fell playing DUNGEONS and DRAGONS for the first time cuz I have never played it before
This is Why I love DnD!!
I s
snap back to reaity op there gos gravity
Oh my God, this sounds like so much fun
0:30 oh it is, especially when you can turn into a giant (7’2” on all 4’s) wolf from hell and drag a roughly 120ft golem into the equivalent of a small nuke against its will
Just came to rewatch this video, and realized Jacob is Larry.  Larry ahh haircut 1:49
I think all the animals in the forest where adventures/people, who fell victim to the bronce door  Maybe the turtel (Paul J.) was a person once 😆 🐢
15:31 - it just dawned on me that one of them while roaring actually clapped their hands and she animated it to a fall on the knees - just masterfully immersed the real world to the animated using the audio, astounding. You can sorta hear the 2 additional follow-up claps after he's already on the ground.
Quick question what classes were you
15:27 CAUGHT ME SO OFF GUARD I ALMOST CHOKED ON MY WATER XD
I love how she casted literal depression onto a manager at ye olde mart of wall, also I’m trying to get into dnd so do you got any people that can run a beginners dungeon?
That was the horse from adventure time
I remember that. Listening to others describe their D&D games before I knew what it was. It was so confusing. "How did you do that? How do you play this game?" I didn't really get it until I actually played a game then the penny dropped.
Do a sequel plz🥺
Hello :D
This video made me remember one time me and my siblings were playing and our group walked into a room that had a mirror and my sister rolled a 20 to “check herself out”
Do it again
4:12
15:25 Jaden you okay? Jaden you okay?😳😳
“12:37 so long gay  laup😂😂😂😂😂”
I really like dnd
As someone who is also new to DnD, I can confirm, one of our players when we were struggling to kill a bunch of vampires thought it was a good idea to put on armor we needed for the quest, which lead to them having a seizure on the floor, and somehow, we both made it out alive with 5 health- (I don’t know how I went down to 5 health in the first place- someone made a toaster explode or something idk-)
but what are the classes?
So this one time our party druid cast thunderwave by letting the fattest rip into 4 goblins, and killed 3 of them. Our party druid killed 3 goblins with a fart.
Part 2!!!
Jaiden and I have the same luck and mindset for this game   Which makes me realize that now I want to recruit nothing but chaotic unlucky and oblivious players with massive adhd to play   Only the dm also is like us   And see the chaos reign
I’m a god of distraction in that game lol
Not Rosalina’s theme from Mario Galaxy 😭
WAS THAT VOX MACHINA AT THE START YOOOOOOOO
Dragonborn is goated
Watching this as a 17 minute video, it might seem short but keep in mind. This was done over like. Five or six sessions over multiple weeks.
YOOOOO WAS THAT THE VOX MACHINA GANG IN THE TAVERN!?!
(ITS WORMIN TIME)  Clay worm-2023
I had a Zelda campaign… Link rolled a Nat 1 on Perception, and he fell on a trap before being shot by an arrow. Link rolled a Nat 1 to hit… and he threw his weapon, causing it to critically shatter on Purah for 11 damage.  I am a menace with my critical failures, lol
what dungeons
IVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT MORE ABT IT AND IT MADE ME SO HAPPY TO SEE A VIDEO ABT IT, ESPECIALLY FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE ANIMATORS😭
why is paul kindaa
i am so Happy that Ranboo and Slimecircle was in this video cause if i ever saw Jaiden, Ranboo, Slmiecircle is together something crazy gonna hapen XD
LUAP!!!! AWWWWW I CRY!!!!
Quote of the year: "ITS WORMIN TIME!!"
So it was a one shot I’m guessing
The  goblins were cooking the horse from adventure time
Oh my god… *IT’S LARRY!*
IVE ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY D&D. but im the only nerd in my family🥲
My DND alias: Tam O'Shanter the Bruce.
Do a another one🎉🎉
I have never thought coconut mall would fit a situation more until now
13:30 and you, Paul....  ....   ....   ANYWAY—YAH 😈
I would fall of the edge like Gobble Gob
DND is the best
This is so funny 😊
One my first session, I got carried by a bard, guess what he did with a goblin brute? He went "Hi, you seemed friendly"
Masked and D.D.D hits hard
Bruh the wife has a beard is 😂💀😂💀😂💀
It's worming time!
DnD bringing together imagination, roleplaying, fantasy creatures, furries, nerds, pokemon fans, cosplayers, and everything in between, I love this sh*t so much. TwT
Did anyone else see the crown clay sculpture... i have a feeling it was ment for technoblade because it had a T for technoblade! And he wore a clown ❤
ITS WORIMG TIME !!!!
I'm normally the dungeon master
I love d&d
This whole episode feels like a mix of Adventure Time and Regular Show 💀😭
So Jaiden's character has cursed speech? What type of magic user is that,is she a sorcerer,how does this type of magic work?
Did jaiden get inspiration for her depression attack from inunaki form jjk
I cast thunder spell
7:04 I thought I recognized the first song in this vid but this one definitely gave it away that it's from Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga : ) Nice choice!
I CAST,NUKLEAR WARFARE
1:15 just watched season 1 of CR and Dam, that was a pleasant surprise.
Please do more d&d vids
i try dnd and yurns out my dungeon master was very advance as when i beat a boss he just said "so you have unlocked communism you can now make a communist town and be able to become a dictator" and then the next hour one of my team members becomes a god damn lizard oil salesmen and i become american guy that likes oil also my charecter is a blind sniper
The Vox Machina reference is crazy
Honestly this is my favorite video
DnD is one of the silliest and most fun games I’ve ever played
SO LONG AY BOWSER
this looks like one of my dreams 1:31
I ship Jaiden and alpharad
my first dnd campaign i was a fighter, and my sister was a chaotic wizard named dixy normus and i was bigi shelves and we wanted to find shack, the biggest man in the world(i wont explain why we wanted to find him, trust me you dont want to know) and there was a guy that knew where he was going to be, he had ginger hair(important) and he said 3 gold for answers, we took the deal then we suspected he was a noble based on his clothes, we were right and the man was a noble, anyway shack was a friend of his father(bad father) WHO WAS A KING, a king of a place called fizz, that really liked orange, we knew were shack was going, a wizzard tower but he didnt give us directions, i try to intimidate him and i kinda forgot what happened during this bit i grabbed him, i was gonna choke him till his party came in, then i softened the hold on the neck, my sister the ine being really charismatic negotiated with em and said they will accompany with this search of shack, my favorite part was when my sister, being a chaotic wizzard decided it was time to see peoples dream, this was really simplified dnd so our dm, my cousin said roll a d20 she absolutely killed it and decided to go in one of our party members dreams and my cousin gave us a choice, his crush or backstory, we chose crush of course, and he was gay, he liked the party leader newt, newt was doing same ritual(this was real except for the love part, you’ll see) so bassicaly they go to the princes room and, do well, stuff in the room luckily they didnt describe it in much detail and since it was the dreamworld we could technically do anything, so i thought it would be funny to put newt, the more girly man in a maid dress.. they stopped a little shocked, but they all were okay with it snd continued, we left that dream amd went to newts dream, this isnt as bad as his dream so were good, gladion the person that likes newt, (newt like gladion too) had a dream about gladion saving newt from falling, suddenly we were playing matchmaker we really wanted them to get together and we sucessfly did it, we still got to the tower and did that, oh yeah, she left me in that dream after the falling one, the really weird one, my character just ran nit wanting to see this.(sorry my spelling was bad in this, really tired rn)

Idk what kinda D&D game this was but it truly was ~epic~
I feel so validated that Jaiden made her character a Dragonborn as did I, I really want to get into dnd again if I ever get the chance so hopefully I can flesh out my character a bit more
can we please just have more narrated dnd stories like this ? please ? XD
I found the campaign that slimcicle used. its called Wild Sheep Chase. to those who are interested
the mario and luigi super star saga music goes HARD
RIP Goblins
I love how Paul is just Larry 2.0
He swung his son into the wall twice
A story about a black and white cat, purple dino, and your average middle aged man
i really want to play d&d but i dont know where to starts
Bro i swear  i unsubed caseu I don’t like dungeon dragons
Does anyone else think drangon Jaiden KINDA looks like Suzie from Deltarune?
I wish my friends took dnd this serious
That was a crazy one shot. Oo Sounds fun though, although I'd probably aim for something a little bit more, you know, serious myself.
Critical role in the beginning tavern scene!!
Please, more D&D stories. You're hella good at telling a story and had me hooked the whole video. Thanks for the entertaining content. Keep up the good work.
We need more of this
I am 100% playing DND with my friends now.
This video was great but marks name was inconsistant, going from thomas to thompson in the span of minutes :[
Oh, that's cute! I've run this exact one-shot for some friends before!
1:15 VOX MACHINA, HELL YEAH!!!
I loved that!
15:28 was cool
16:11  YOU'RE MY PERSONAL HELL!!!
15:21   Wait a few seconds BOOM extremely funny part
14:08   DEPRESSION!
Favorite part 8:22
If i got impaled by an axe i would just be like “aw man”
wait until she finds out about roblox-
Was that a fuecoco?
Looking at the Riddle Door Section. As a DM I can tell you that, that has slowed a game to an absolute crawl. It's a Double Whammy of a Party's 2 worst enemies: Doors and Elementary Grade Riddles.
It's a TTRPG
Ranboo No!!!!!!!!
Nah this sounds fun but my dumb brain is going to be like “everyone is dead so I win”
Kudos for the amazing setup of the D&D quest. Simple, but fun to play. Charlie planned out the game to be easy to get into the game and knew what his players would enjoy. <3
I love dnd and I'm currently making my character cuz I'm new to it
I would really love a second one of this
Jaiden: TURTLE I CHOSE YOU!!! *Throws turtle* **The wall undamaged** Jaiden: Well damn
Just noticed dungeon master rolling two dice when tholomew said the 70 percent chance of waiter slipping
hey
3:03 MAKE AN ATTACK ROLE ON THE SHEEP 🐑
oh. my. gods. YOU PLAYED DND?????I LOVE DND :,0
One time in a dnd campaign I was in I was a cleric so i worshipped god and crap. And I really wanted a grimace shake, so I prayed for a grimace shake. And I quote my dm: "The roof of the cave opens up to reveal a heavenly, yellow light while an angelic choir plays. From the opening in the roof comes a purple, frothy, berry-flavored milkshake in a plastic cup that descends into your hands." I used it to throw at a mage guy we met but it missed and hit a zombie behind him which made him fight us so we killed him. I was told we would have been able to get a quest if I hadnt thrown the grimace shake.
Literally me for no reason 9:14
ive been trying to find the title of the first song you used 😭
Why is Paul Jr. Literally white but Paul isnt
9:51 ICE KINGS HORSE COSTUME RAHHHHHHHG RAJHHH ADVENTURE TIME!! 🔥🔥🔥
So basically he told her the basic bard seduces ____ meme
not the cow from adventure time
There are ogres in dnd?!?!?!?!??!?!
15:58 clearly a 1 XD
bro i wanna try playing D&D so bad but i don't have anyone to play with 😭
OK, I unsubscribe. I’m just kidding. I love your channel.
Jaiden: Shh. its okay, I'm here now, consoles the antagonist. Also Jaiden: Blasts the main antagonist after making the antagonist think its his wife and consoling him with acid point blank range.
I never played D&D, but I want to in the future (If I can find some people to play with).
“You’re my personal hell” is a fire one liner
740
You have no idea how many times I've watched this it's so funny and makes me laugh every time
it's time to do DEPRESSION
Jaiden is the dragon born !!! FUS RO DHAAAAA
I like how instead of using sound clips from the stream, Jaiden voice acted the whole thing
Ronboo 😭   Ranboo 😊
1:16 CRITICAL ROLE
OHHHHHH MY GODD no way, the combination of people is perfect! this is awesome!
Got my butt wiped by 3 ogres, crazie, but fun.
I really want to be involved in DND so much but I have no idea how that works and I don't have friends to play that, it's very painful to watch other people play it
Yes. :)
I was watching the phasmophobia video on the slimecicle channel and the fact that the first ghost was named Mark Thomson was hilarious to me
9:30 adsfanimations refrence
Why does Paul look like Larry from pokemon S/V xD
Now I wanna play dungeons and dragons
I would be laughing with ranboo and the master charlie😂😂
Idk why but every time we play it somehow leads to the universe exploding and then the Big Bang happens
Why does alpharad look like Larry from pokemon scarlet and violet lol😂😂
“DEPRESSION” the strongest spell in DnD
Mr president is that a JoJo reference
When she included mario and luigis superstar saga music danger abounds, we cant lose, and cackletta the fiercest foe i was really happy cause that was one of not many games to have the KOOPALINGS
i have only watched 1 min and 15 sec and i already love this and especially the vox machina reference
Everyone dying laughing is very much a thing that happens in campaigns once a group i was in was taking a peaceful ride in an air balloon and then one of the party members just straight up throws a dagger at all the mechanics AND WE START JUST PLUMMETING TO THE GROUND and we're just here rolling on the floor laughing cause there was no reason to do that but they did
THIS WAS THE BEST THING I'VE SEEN THIS MONTH HAHAHAHAHAH
“So Paul, So Long Gay Bowser’s the sheep into the exact opposite wall.” Jaiden - October, 2023.
ONE OF THE MOST DND THINGS EVER XD LOVE THE VID ^^
in a dnd i did my friend seduced the devil and had a child-
you were a monkey
dident you do dnd befor?
Love this video so much!! I love D&D! The Legend of Vox Machina cameo and Paul reminding me of Barry from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet! :)
why did mark thompson pull a i miss my wife tails i miss her alot
Wish I could play d&d, sadly Chicago don’t fw that 😔
Wish I could play d&d, sadly Chicago don’t fw that 😔
Vox Machina being in here is the best🔥
I did not expect the vox machina reference!
I'm maybe probably definitely reading too much into something that doesn't exist, but the goblins names sounds like a Brooklyn Nine-Nine reference to me - Boyle says "Gobble Gobble Gobble"
1:15 vox machina reference!!
It feels like a sin to hear someone call him "Rahnboo" and not "Ranboo"
1:39 My name is Yoshikage Kira
I love how it all circles back to a “would you still love me if I was a worm” joke
Having the name selection for the turtle being bong water is my favorite, we’ve all wanted to name a animal that
I knew I got lucky when this thing that's new to me had an animated storytime, and I was right
I love the dragon  design
More DND plz
This got me into dnd and I love it now!!! ❤❤
Top 10 best quotes. First up we have "ITS WORMING TIME"
best vid i ever watched :P
amazing
This was my first video of yours I’ve seen it was amazing!!
Here’s something random but do people think that Jaiden should make mesh for Mr yettobethrownoutlemon?
Hey, can you put the Spanish language in your videos please?    Saludos of chile
Anyone else realize that Paul’s (alpharad’s character) tie changes to zebra print after being turned back from one?
BRO DID WHAT TO THE OGER💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
This starts suspiciously close to "The wild sheep chase" one shot
Nah bc my first DND meet, I ended up seducing the innkeeper’s son, and then the innkeeper the very next day. (My character was a adult fun for money person before he was dragged into the party.)
The fact she actually wrote speak with animals in draconic is so cool
Its so funny that you can clearly see when they roll above or under 10.
DEPRESSION
oi
11:17 As someone who played DnD...I immediately thought that they were going to run into a gelatinous cube. I was surprised that it wasn't, especially cinsidering who was DM for this.
All i hear from the door is mmhmhwmwmwwmjeeemeeeheeme
4:13 9 months later, i just noticed that there's a silhouette of fuecoco in the background
D&d is great
I did a dnd one shot where my characters name was deathbringer. he was a tabaxi rouge assasin. lets jusr say by the time we left the spaceship, nobody was left alive, and his daggers were coated in blood.
Please do it again I loved it and I am subscribed pls
YouTube: A man in a suit. Me: Causally thinking of the man in the suit Time: 1:30
I am a big d&d nerd
i have a 19 in rizz/charizma
With a gun
just noticed that when alpharad was naming his turtle, the keyboard said “name your son”, nice foreshadowing
Few understand you can play D&D using a phb and charactersheets. Roll up pcs and fight each others characters in a tournament. Winner gets the gold entry fee. This works best as a way to teach many noobs how to generate pcs and grasp basic melee combat.
Vox Machina reference in thr old oak inn! (I love vox machina)
Oh my gosh. Jaiden made alpharads character look like Larry from Pokemon.😂😂😂
the tie change is a nice touch
Paul has so much aura
I've never played so, I'd like it
A WILD SHEEP CHASE!!! I love this adventure!
I’ve always wanted to play dnd I just don’t know how 😅
Alpharad after this: Mark...we need to talk ...
14:58 nah i knew someone named Ella and they kinda looked like herrrrrr
Before commenting I got a guideline thingy that said “bring something fun to the table tell some jokes! Unfortunately I am not funny.    so…😀                            e
Omg u should post ur game more I loved it 🥰
9:51  the horse from adventure time is really funny 😂
The adventure time horse and the world smallest Violin HAHAHa😂, superior references may I say
why were they cooking the horse from adventure time
Hey, you, you're finally awake.
Pls do more of this kind of this video
the door is my favorite character
:>
Hehe, The horse the goblins were eating was from Adventure Time 😈
NO WAY THE CHULK IS THE DUNGEON MASTER
Yeah! You're main DnD character is also a dragonborn!
Do another one pls it would be fun for a part two
Just out of nowhere and went Daniel tiger moment and says "well hey there neighbor"
I never played the game before but I really look forward to do so, where can I play it online?
The crossover we never knew we needed.
Imagine goblgobs rolls
this was fun
PLEASS DO MORE DND
DEPRESSION! TAKE THAT DEPRESSION!
I loved the moment when the clay worm said "it's worming time" and wormed to death
Omg jaiden i clicked on this video to learn how to play and in the in the first 0:02 0:03 0:03 0:04 0:05 0:06 0:06 0:08 0:09 0:09 0:10 0:11 0:11 i already love it 😮😇😎🥳🧐
Here’s a funny d&d story I had with my friends  It started in a cave with some gremlins and as a joke I tried to seduce it (I rolled a 3 and basically was eradicated from the battle), after that battle we all went to a weird floating battleship thing with tentacles and I tried to seduce the weird head crab lookin enemies in the ships and I got a NAT 1 💀 after that everyone jokingly also sudeuced it and all got from 2-4’s 💀💀💀
Someone know what race is ranboo?
I love your content. Nothing in your videos is cringe. 🤗🙂🙃
Hey jaiden I’m trying to make a channel where I animate wanna help
This is exactly what I was looking for!
4:33 is that a j- j-       Jojo reference!?
I cast thunder spell!
Wait a minute, this was ONE SESSION!?

I love how you can tell generally the rolls of every action.
I love the displacer beast head on the wall of the tavern
After this i going to try dnd

I love that The horse is The one From adventure time where they get stalked by ice king 10:04
I made a giant ice worm depression once 14:09
My friend seduced a goddess welcome to dnd.
14:20 I miss my wife tails...
Why did this feel like Deltarune
I translated the scroll at the beginning and it actually says speak with animals
Lol halfway through The video I was Like omg human lop and Paul should date ! I was so wrong
Vox machina mentioned‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️  Also I like really love you and your content ❤❤❤
Please make another dnd video or series! These are soooo funny!
I'm totally gonna steal the "manager salaryman barbarian" character idea, his rages being fueled by dealing with asshole customers
0:35 I did the goofiest ass smirk and just subscribed then and there, It's the principle
15:29 WHAT THE MARKS DEAD FROM POINT BLANK ACID 😳AND AGAIN HE SHOULDVE DIED BY NOW 16:12
Penguins and turtle omg what if they both had guns the turtle sight a ak47 and the penguin with a 50 cal sniper 😂😂
I absolutely love D&D and great to hear u enjoyed hope to see more D&D videos in the future
ARI PLUSH LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
Can you play hollow knight
I have watched this before, it was so funny and cool! ❤❤❤❤❤
"Zoot pulls back, just a bit, just to see Mark's eyes, which are sparkling with tears..."  "And proceeds to acid blast him point blank from the mouth."  [Slimecicle and Ranboo are laughing their asses off while Alpharad is just confused]
Did you ever heard about bone wizard?
Jayden: dragon with no lore Ranboo: misinformation  Alpharad: *lary with more lore/backstory*
I haven’t even gotten two minutes in, but the second I heard her say that Charlie was the game master… I know that all hell is gonna break loose.
I saw alphas character and imediatly said LARRY FROM SAV?
9:50 adventure time reference??
Dungeons and Dragons is a lot of fun!!!
More dnd required
Fun fact, cats are allergic to milk, and mice hate or are allergic to cheese!
That was such a good video 🎉🎉
The first time I played d&d I was a cleric that liked to crush goblin skulls in with a ginormous Warhammer
Ah yes ITS WORMIN TIME
15:20
...I only just NOW got the time to comment this, but, wait a minute... Mark Thompson? Wasn't Tholomew's neighbor called Thomas at the beginning of the video?
This is the most beautiful campaign I’ve ever watched
This is actually a really good story. I want to see another one.
bad video
wow this was a cool video omg
Mark have uniform like kyivstar uniform(?)😅😂
Is it just me or does Paul look like Larry from Pokémon?
What happened to the tutel
dooooo more NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man, I wish I was a member to Jaiden Animations, but I can't afford it! Child restraints!!! Give me my rights!!! Moneyyy!!!
Jaiden (zoot): translates the scroll *bar freaking explodes* Seems like D&D to me
markrober
So uh here is a funny detail..... Ive been watching Jaiden for 2 years and yet i just subscribed only 1 day ago😅😅
alpharad aka larry from pokemon
you have convinced me to join this hell of a place of D&D rest in peace don't die
Hallo from Russia! I'm DM and gaming D&d 3 year's. My friend moved to the USA 2 years ago. She was offered to make a character, but she was not given any setting or help! I usually always help the newbies.
1:14 VOX MACHINA REFERENCE?!?! AHHHHH
I just subbed because of the insane animations you did, great job
You gotta love the Over The Garden Wall references in the background
👍👍😀😀
The jaiden bad trip and gobble gob jumpung off the cliff twice were the best parts
If kid me could see Jaiden animate Vox Machina they would have lost their MIND 💀
The creature the goblins  are cooking is a horse from adventure time
Sees Alpharad LARRY
Me beging a gravity falls fan: NO, IT’S DUNGEONS, DUNGEONS AND MORE DUNGEONS!
Is no one gonna talk about the vox machina reference at the start?
I would have loved for you just to animate the real Session just filming the session and using it to animate  Edit: i know it would be a lot more work but i still can have my hopes
13:40 just did the obito
“Zoot immediately pitches the turtle at the door” 😂😂😂
I used Jaden's video in my first game as dm!! Thanks, Jaden, my friends liked it:)
I always wanted to play D&D, but never got the chance
1:15  THE VOX MACHINA
at 8:20 i assume you got a d 20 from just running away and killing it by screaming at a high pitch?
2:00 14:13 15:29 16:12 16:54 17:11
Alpharad's character is just Larry from S/V
Me literally always thinking of otherworldly stuff and my reaction to this; "Woah there is a game like this!!"
I wonder… what did they do with Worm Mark Thomson?
The video was so niiice, you need to do more video like this !  Ho and I loooooooove Dungeons and Dragons, but sadly the last DM was sooooo bad
i once started a sharknado in dnd😭
Before once during dnd I died, went to heaven for 5 minutes, and the became a moon God for another 5 minutes to defeat a dragon who takes people's life's away for energy and power.
Hi Jaiden ı want to do animation to ı have windows 10 how can ı do like your animations.
Can we play dnd? please 🥺
So long gay Bowers hahaha
THATS VOX MACHINA IN THE TAVERN
DRAGONBORN DO NOT HAVE TAILS
This was more wild than I expected!
I see what you did there with the Vox Machina cameo….
15:29 😂😂😂😂
I collectively gasped in "Oooooh..." after Paul Jr came back unintentionally lmao
I turned on this video just to have something to watch until dinner. But this video was too good to eat while watching O.O This animation is brilliant! <3
I WANNA PLAY DND SO BADD IT LOOKS LIKE A TON OF FUN BUT I DONT GOT FRIEDNS WHO KNOW HOW TO PLAY AND ITS HARD OT LEARNN
the fact i know this session took 8 hours
Did anyone notice the Legend of Zelda: Wind Walker music at the beginning
No way Jaden brushed over the 3 hour character creator section
I’m still laughing over how you draw characters as marshmallows.
I don't think it's fun but I've tried it before sooooo can I still be subscribed
nnnnnnNNNNNNNNNNEEEERRDD
Pls make more dnd content
I’m so happy for you Jayden! I fell in love with your videos a few years ago. You’re so sweet! And you winning the mr beast video was the best outcome ever!! It’s So awesome the most genuine person won.  YOU GO GIRL
Omg the amount of times I gasped 😂❤❤❤
The answer was zebra
I cried inside when mark was hugging who he thought was his wife, but everything went backwards when the dragon barfs acid on him.
" I'm Gob, that's Glob, that's Goble, that's GobleGob, and that's the Peeler " 🤣
Does anyone know what the music is at 12:28 ? 😭I’ve been trying to find it because it’s such a bop
Should have use AvadaKadabra as the spell but it is your game do you
JAIDEN I LOVED THIS PLEASE DO MORE
Can we get part 2
4:15 Over the Garden Wall mentioned
PURRsonal hell 😂 I had to make a cat joke
I actually used this as a base for my own D&D oneshot (by which I mean I directly copied a bunch of it and then just tweaked the rest to suit my needs). One of my best tweaks though led to my favourite player freakout. The villain both here and in my campaign is (most likely) a warlock with a fae patron. I gave my warlock a fun little spell called Blink. Roll a d20 and if you get 11 or higher, you disappear to a different plane of existance. At the start of your next turn, you reappear, do your attack, roll to vanish, and disappear again. You can do this for ten rounds of combat per spell slot. One of my players spent two minutes swearing at me when he realized what I did.
JAIDEN!! A cool guy named Symth just sent out a video asking about the chance to pursue art!! You should check out his video he’s really good!
This seems like an incredible first experience of a campaign! The planning this must've taken and the story development writing, just amazing. Thank you DM's for providing the story, magic, and connections between characters and players
Is alpharad larry from pokemon?
The character at 0:04 is literally my character that's so cool
The clay crown should’ve been a head crab from half life
I absolutely *adore* D&D, and it's a heavy favorite among my friends, to the point that we get the most *unhinged* outcomes possible no matter what setting we're in or what we do. (My friends couldn't stop talking about the campaign I ran a year ago for months after it ended, and whenever I make a super memorable character to play in one of their campaigns, they can't help but meme the crap out of it). All that to say that D&D is what you make of it, and it's all about the journey and having fun.
I love Your videos❤❤❤❤❤
WHY DOES PAUL LOOK LIKE DRACO MALFOY 😭
I happy you are 🏆
Your vid are so cool i love i could also do slmething like that
THIS IS UTTERLY AMAZING, CONGRATS ON THE HIGH QUALITY CONTENT, JAIDEN!!!
Since you know  charley and ranboo please make a video with @TommyInnit
Nc❤❤❤
11:22 Jaiden knows the Joestar Technique.
Is aplharad larey from pkmn
Who is here after her Mr beast million dollar win?
Can you please do anything to get Learn this kind of animation, as you won mr beast challenge. And please can you donate some laptop
Love ur vid
I play dnd and I was an aracokra who blew up in a nuke and became kfc or afc.
Im dead i watched this at 3.40am and i laughed my ass off
Best part by far and relatable 14:08 I take that back this is the best part 15:30
I knew  u were going to winnnn!!!!!!!
😂
This is my dream friend group lmao
It sucks
I need $50,000? I can wear a good varsity because I don't have a dollar. Give me some dollars 😭😭🥲 Please sister 😭😭  My father is poor and my mother is a housewife.  Please sir, if not, my studies will be stopped?  I live in Bangladesh😭😭😭
FROM MR BEAST VIDEO YOU WON A MILLION DOLLARS CONGRATULATIONS!
So I should unsub?😢
Fun fact: thalamew is a tabaxi
The plot twist at the end was wild it threw me on a luap
I remember i played this campaign but except for the riddle doors my DM had there me animals on the door and we had to act them out for the doors to open 😂
I rolled a double d20 to seduce the dragon. And. Won.
In my campaign there are 3 princes fighting for control they are all in someway stupid and one thinks all drinks should be replaced by alcohol another thinks that the stars are falling out of the sky another thinks that we should kill all ox’s because he believes there is a deadly undetected disease that kills everything guess who’s right
love the casual vox machina referance in the bar
Is it just me or does Zuut kind of look like an anthro version of fatespeaker from WOF
We are currently in a campaign and my sister got -1 charisma 😂
I need more
Eating the clay randomly is the most D&D thing ever.
Dude me and my friends who have never played dnd and didn’t know the rules saw this and all said “we like this, we need this” so we tried to play dnd not knowing any of the rules, back then we thought it was just a game where you played as a character you create and you could do whatever you wanted as long as you rolled good, at one point at that time I rolled to become the president of the United States, I got a 16 and became the vice president, we still play dnd now, ACTUAL dnd this time
loving how you can tell when they rolled nat 1s
HOW DID I MISS THIS saw Charlie's reaction to it
4:11 BILL CIPHER
1:15 I KNOW U DIDNT JUST ADD THEM WITHOUT ME NOTICInG  (I forgot the anime name:(
I just noticed l think everyone has 4 fingers.. 😧
make more of this
dnd dnd dnd ✊  ✊  ✊
Plz do more this video has been the best I have seen in a while
So, how many 1's did you guys roll?
Make more dnd it's fun to see
YOOOO I LOVE D&D
Also i recognized the horse from adventure time lol
YESSS JOIN THE DARK SIDEEE
"DEPRESSION!!" is the best one
its the mario and luigi superstar saga effects and music for me
Why was there a part with rizz
You need a fun dungeon master to have a good game. I remember I rolled a 7 and had to eat metal ingots and grew machine guns instead of arms
Why grandpa was one of the creators
Once while I was playing dnd I was eating moldy broccoli with my in game cousin and my friend ate the bowl and nothing else
I NEED TO SEE HER PLAYING THE PARANORMAL ORDER SYSTEM
It's nice to know that Mark the Micromanaging Neighbor isn't racist.... considering that Disguise self still was still a Dragonborn. I approve.
JAIDEN THE ENDERDRAGON-
15:40 uh oh, King Dedede music. It’s about to go down!
I can't even imagine that D&D could be such an interesting game. It was really fun to listen to, but for me personally this is a problem, since this game, unfortunately, is not available in Russia. That was really cool
Is it wrong I expected her to snap his neck while hugging him
1:16 i liked the vox machina reference at the beginning in the tavern!!!!
"... so Paul so-long-Gay-Bowser-s the sheep into the air..." Is something I never thought I'd hear Jaiden say.
"dont listen to him he's a zebra"  very compelling arguement
Oh my god, Tholomew is SO CUTE!! Jaiden did an amazing job animating him.
I SUB
I love DanD
I want to play dungeons & dragons, but I don't have anyone to play with me and I am bad with detail.
Face reveal please🙏🏾
Did Zut (I SPELLED THAT WRONG DIDNT I ) mention her name-
I NEED A SERIES OF THIS!! >:0
Why i can easly imagine some sort of weird fantasy show with y'all? 🤣
I love dnd
What about the time loop?
i would pay good money to watch the whole recording. even after all these months
You just got coconut-malled
where do i play the game i have the starting set but i want to play over calls and stuff is there like a game that they play it on???
“ITS WORMIN TIME” “ITS SWEEPING TIME SWEEP SWEEP”
"Zeut pulls back, just a bit, just to look into marks eyes, which are sparkling with tears.😢"     *and proceeds to acid blast him point blank from the mouth* killed me😂
0:57 JAIDEN IS A FURRY
Jaiden is a furry confirmed?
Just played my first "game" of DnD and when we got attacked by goblins I used a horse to run it over. Not insane but I just feel proud of myself
Only Doug Doug could have made this look sane
"Paul jr, whay do you thing the answer is?" "Uhm- ACH- T-TURTLE! >:("
that's a lot of nat 1s lol, must have been using emphasis dice
I would wanna join their DnD session but they dont even know me and im not even in america ;-;
I love d and d
1:14 i just realized that's vox machina
Paul is Larry from Pokemon + nanami from jjk
YOU KNOW DSMP CHARACTERS !?
The character you made is so cool
I would love to see more of these
tbh after seeing this video now it gets me to actually now wanna play dnd
the things they manage to sneak into these videos. love that they added vox machina in the bar
watched slimecicles video reacting to this two days ago, drew my first dnd character and stayed up all night :3
i wanted to play dnd with my friends
When you use acid blast I was laughing so hard
Alpharad looks like the normal type gym leader from scarlet and violet
I like how you just didn’t mention how you literally spoke to satan and made like 3 deals with it
"DEPRESSION!!!!!!" GOT ME DYING 🤣💀
The characters in the beginning are from the D&D show Vox Machina
A,Meninageimiswiert😮?❤
Let’s see the character sheets for everyone!
AGAIN PLEASE!
this was awesome, we need more of these hahahaha 😂
16:53 I feel like this scene is a reference, but I don’t know if it’s a reference to anything at all.
0:37 ich bin Überzeugt
Why would you *eat* the clay?! XD if I tried, I'd probably take a d8 of damage or something lol  Also, you were a Dragon born? What type? Ohh, Acid breath? Nice, I have fire :D  This is coming from someone playing a Brass dragon born lol  Ahh I was waiting for that Acid breath at the end XD
8:10 what is the background music that is used here called?
Sheldon’s moms disagrees
power word "DEPRESSION" is insane
Not sophits thunder spell I CAST ASED BLAST
Me noticing for the first time that you said Ranboo was playing and this and it is my thousands time watching this lol😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hey, this was completly awesome, do you think that you can maybe reveal the character sheet of your character? I think it has cool things and want to see how you did it
What da Paul doin? Also why would you have MACE IN YOUR BAG?! 😂 This video is peak, I’m telling you.
I just realised she drew the characters from Critcal role campaign 1
“If I can just stab you first,” the most Roman thing ever said.
When I first watched this I was like “who are the ppl playing” and now I’m like “OH SHOOT JAIDEN PLAYED WITH. RANBOO AND CHARLIE!?!?!?”
they threw a fucking sheep at a stick
The goblins look like the goblins from the Rainbow Magic Book series. Man that brings back memories!
too short :(
I’m ten, and I LOVE THIS GAME😊
give us more!!!
YEEEESSSSSSS NERDS UNIT!!!!!!!!!!
was fun
A hev playd
My character is a penguin wizard with ice powers 😂
Paul looks like lary from pokemon
Love how Paul is just Jacob's "larry-sona"
I've wanted to play dnd for a while but never had the courage so watching this helped me a lot, thanks you.
jaiden is there going to be a part two?
HOW TO PLAY DND IDK HOW PLEASE SOMEONE TEACH ME
Just came from watching Legends of Avantris
i love how you can tell exactly when they get a high or a low roll
this played out like dang movie
14:53
alpharad is literaly skiny all might
Hello, I had a lot of fun, thank you Jeiden.
This was An amazing story, awesome job animating it
I love the OTGW reference at 4:15  (At least I think it is, it looks like the beast)
The fact that she narrates her own crimes and awkwardness in 3rd person is simply hilarious
Офигенно
I can't understand what the door is saying
I just watched the nine hour twenty eight minute and fifteen second vod and this was amazing
That was....AMAZING!!!!!
So you know what happened when I played D&D? So in dnd I was able to kill a dragon & get it's heart so..... I cooked it
I’ve played this before, and did the yellow dragon one. It’s pretty fun because you can do whatever you want, but an only restraint is a dice. Which actually controls how good your actions are. Like destroying an enemy because you rolled a 20 on a D20. D&D is incredible, and I hope everybody gets a chance to play this amazing game.
Theres mario and luigi super star saga music
I love dnd 😊❤
Wait is ranboo still cursed ...
Well now I want to play D&D. DAMN YOU JAIDEN!!! /lhj
Why did alphared look like Larry but with white hair
Was i the only one who luaghed uncontrollably when she said that zoot shouted DEPRESSION
do moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Does anyone know the song that plays at 16:32?
FINNALLY SOMEONE ON YT DID DND
1:15 VOX MACHINA.
Highly recommend rapidly tapping back at the start of this video. "D d d dd d dungeons and dragons!!"
LOL I began to uncontrollably sob at Marks depression part
IDK why but I began to uncontrollably sob at Marks depression part
I LOVE DND
😂😂 HAHAHAHAHAH😂😂
I LOVE HOW MUCH I CAN RELATE TO THE CRAZY HILARIOUSNESS OF YALLS CAMPAIGN! ME AND MY FRIENDS GO INSANE WUTH OUR CAMPAIGN TOO
You should make another video like this
Mark seeing his exwife is just depressing
*looks into his eyes and point blank acid breaths him* best moment tbh
Part2!!!
I'm not 100% sure, but around 4:11, I'm pretty sure that's a Kipo and the age of the Wonderbeasts reference, and if it is, then that is probably one of the best and most obscure references in Jaiden Animation history!
I freaking loved this whole video, man.
You are the reason I want to play d and d
15:30 i knew it
The luap plot twist was CRAZY
1:22 tehy cant see the invisible force who would have thought
1:40 put kira yoshikages theme boy
Paul is a mood
5:29 said the exact same thing
I have watched this vid like 4 times now but I just realized that the doors go up in ranks. Bronze 🥉, silver 🥈, gold 🥇
nice vox machina reference lol
wat
if anyone finds this, here's a suggestion for a custom magic item for your next character. A book with hundreds of pages, all enchanted with a fireball spell so that when you open the book, all the fireball spells go off and you essentially set off a nuke
I really liked your pokemon nuzlock animations , please keep uploading things like this!!
welcome to the dungeon newcomer
The duo of Jaden and Alpha PLUS Rambo and Slime is one heck of a squad
"Don't listen to him, he's a zebra!" Was great
14:08 *D E P R E S I O N*. The best spell
I need to play this game
is that vox machina?
I’m so glad the schlumgulur introduced you to the funny rock
Is alpharad’s character design a DIRECT reference to Larry from Pokémon?
Was that the mech dragon at the end?
This is such a good videooooo
that was fun, agin agin
I’m sad she didn’t include the number the dice rolled 😔
love the vox machina ester egg at the start
That was surprisingly cohesive, I expected it to be far more chaotic.
If d&d is a board game without the board. Then what is a board game without the game?
I would like to elope with an ogre
was it just me or did anyone else notice the Vox Machina group? 1:16
People at the athlete outings, bars and clubs cannot compute 💬💬💬  Anyone wanna open a late night spot to play D&D?  Poker rooms are expensive to sit at the table and the strip clubs are meh.  Debt is a slippery slope in Austin, Texas.   Everything is so expensive for the average Joes.   If I were a female with nice boobs and a nice butt, life feels more free in high rises and yacht decks in the Devil's Cove and Lake Austin.  It's even more free in Las Vegas.
The Legend of Vox Machina ! lets goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Interesting 😮😮😮😮
*"DEPRESSION!"*  New magic to fear unlocked.
RANBOO??? ... Ahem Paul looks like draco Malfoy
Eats clay aggressively
Oh my god, I never thought about using "Depression" as a command word.
VOX MACHINA WAS IN THE INN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that's all, back to the video
“Don’t listen to him, he’s a zebra”. Actually fair logic
Wait. If the door could swap him from Zebra to human, could the door not swap the sheep to human as well?
d&d look so cool img oing to subcribe and hit that bell and like and sbscribe and hit that bell
Command “Depression.” Rough.
I’d love for Jaiden to make this a regular animated series one here channel where she animates one shot DND adventures, even if it’s just like a once a year thing
RANBOO CHARLIE AND JADEN????
lol why does jaiden's dnd character look like susie from deltarune
DnD is so fun and I always am a elf😁 although my ADHD makes me have to  wait every 5 minutes and then continue😅
make a video like this again
ayyyyyy im olso an dragonborn
Just how many nat 1s did yall roll XDD
subscribing because she said so 🤪
Tholemu is multiple people? Why are you saying ‘they?’
Can we please have more of this third person talk videos
I need more animations of them playing DND 😭
Fun fact: this one shot is called ‘A wild sheep chase,’ and was made by Winghorn Press
So Pokemon D&D Exists, just sayin
don't think i missed jason fundeburker at 4:34. over the garden wall fans know whats up.
My first time playing dnd was 1 session in a campaign that we havent done another session on in a while party couldnt get together. Butit was just bandits the first session not this malarky
SHES A DRAGÓNBORN AHHHHH
Not coconut mall being played about 2:45 in…
PLS DO MORE OF THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hey I've been looking for a DnD group lately
1:15  Wuh oh, you do NOT wanna be in a tavern while Vox Machina is in there gettin drunk haha  Also, 12:36 "SolongayBowser" is now officially a verb in my permanent vocabulary.
Jaiden being bri ish’
“So Paul so-long-gay-bowser’s the sheep.”
This is one of the most playd one shots ever...
So whats their classes?
1:53 why does the guy look like larry the normal type gym leader from pokemon scarlet and violet??
RANBOOS CHARECTER IS SO CUT3EEE😮😮😮❤❤❤
Part two plzzzzzz
Dude I felt like I just watched a pilot to a show, I’m so invested in the characters and story
Of course the dragonborn. It's always the dragonborn
Ranboos character is so cute
Such a good story I Love D N D! Who made the story by the way?
Please do more dnd i cant stop watching for some reason PLEASE DO MORE I PLEASE PLEASE
Seeing Jaiden's version of drawing Slimecicle was amazing and she perfectly captured his insane villainry.
0:24 Lmao I love the Shrek onion cart. 12:14 ALPHARAD DOING A CROSS LMAO
ADVENTURE TIME ICE KING NOOOOOO 9:48
I like this story
when mark cried at the end it made me cringe a bit but i still liked the entire thing
I love that Bongwater was an option for the turtles name 😂😂😂
Very funny video. Have you any tipps how to engage into this type of roleplay? I´ve got an invite to a D&D group but do not know how to perform roleplay by just thinking
One of the best stories I've read is when a barbarian casts magic missile. He picks up the wizard and throws him at the enemy 💀
3:21 the 3 of them plus the sheep spell out the word “No” lol 😂
my mom forbids i ever play D&D, but i really love the concept (sorry i'm hungry, have any puzzle clay?)      :D
15:33 that is me all day when I hear a really good joke
Jaiden literally made a movie
10:54 missed opportunity to say "The peeler peels out"
I prefer the final fantasy games than DnD.
Does Jaiden just license the Windwaker OST every time or is she just allowed to use it for free?
Im a dragon born too !!!
This was one of the best videos! I love the story so much!!!
Someone trying to find me 1:39
The point-blank acid spray was not expected…
Is it just me or i love ranboo's character
I find it really funny how mark treats Paul for seamingly no reason I mean I’m pretty sure he was the one who turned Paul jr. into a sheep
VOX MACHINA MENTIONED
Anyone notice in the spooky forest the silhouette of The Beast from Over The Garden Wall?
I can't be the only person who immediately thought of Broom-Stache man from Let Me Explain Studios when I saw Mark Thompson
Dragon born is op 0:57
wait a second, ye ole mart of wall? WALLMART???
DEPRESSION🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
I wonder if they fail their mission the day would it restart and the time Loop would keep going
this is so cool
I saw a fuecoco shadow in the woods background 😮
My brother saw Paul and yelled "It's Sanji!!" Lmao
The best!!!
IKEEPTHE HEADSOFMYOPPONENTS
The sheep was pretty weird,but I’ve imagined weirder like a freaking dragon eating itself 😂
I loved it and I love how are you cutie Cat
Me 5 seconds ago: Well if i play the game i would be a dragonbor...  Jaiden is a Dragonborn   Me:  Can she read my mind or what?
Why does jaiden always collect wildlife into his pockets 4:16
Pt2 needed
Jaiden should be in the magic noah show
17:11 that dragon is two things one it looks amazing and two why dose it look like fools gold dragon a different dnd story from a different story time animator
love the fact that the uhhh adventure time horse is being cooked
1:42 — I JUST REALIZED THAT YE OLD MART OF WAL MEANS WALMART 😦
We want more D&D videos
I am unalive a ton of people in  DND
I just love Paul looks like Larry from Pokémon gen 9
bro i just realized when paaul gets turned into a zebra it makes a... meme sound idk how to describe it-
Where can u buy dnd in canada
istg the branch was a reference to pokemon emerald and ruby as the materials
We need a series on just one campaign where the group gets back together to do a month-long campaign about a city ig?? Maybe underwater? In the sky? Who knows As unlikely this will happen, there's always that slither of possibility.
This is literally just a psychotic fever dream…
13:02, why is the animation so smooth?
You have incredible luck when rolling
I love the fact that you casually played DND with some of the chillest people on Earth ONG THE VOX MACHINA DRAW-IN YOU ARE SO COOL WHAT
I see Vox Machina 1:15
15:27 -AND PROCEEDS TO ACID BLAST HIM POINT BLANK FROM THE MOUTH
*having a wholesome moment with the enemy* 5 secs later : *proceeds to acid blast them at point blank*
This is why i love dnd
WE NEED MORE DND *NOW*   THE HIVE REQUIRES MORE OFFERINGS  but this was fun to watch and listen to, great job jaiden, you earn a gold star  ⭐️
10:39 -> 12:14 I tried all I could I erased the voices so I can just have the background song and still can't find it. It's so damn epic, I need to hear it's full version. But I'm out of options, neither Shazam could find it I'm desperate. EDIT: I just scrolled over the +22k comments this video has. Now I'm truly out of options
THAT WAS SO COOL!! PLEASE DO THIS AGAIN!
This sounds like such a fun game but I still don’t know how to play it😭
Yeah am calling it vox mac
SLIME ? RANBOO???
Yay! A fellow dragonborn
Point blank acid blast
4:16 GOTTA, CATCH EM ALL, ANIMALS!😂
Bro this is better then a Netflix movie👍🏻
I hope to see more of these. This was so fun!!
I had my first session last month with some friends/classmates from school.  My drow ranger threw a lemon at a delusional wood elf.  In the eye.
Top 10 biggest anime betrayals ever:  Acid blasting mark
you guys should all record and animate these sessions
Did anyone else spot the numerous over the garden wall references??? 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I SPOTTED VOX MACHINA!!!
Was that sopost to be vox mocena in the beginning
Not the adventure time horse being roasted alive 😂☠️
Love it 00:00
Love the critical role reference at 1:15
I love the turtle  it's so funny
alright, HOLD. jaiden thinks eloping with an ogre is "crazy fun" 💀
if you dont do a part 2, i'll unsubscribe
lol the acid breath at the end!!!
Paul looks like Draco Malfoy from Harry Potter
I don't know how to play  DDD
I finally got back from watxhing he actaul thing also you forgot to mention on how paul and his son are gonna make target
My first campaign, i may or may not have blown up a dudes, nether region.
if you squint ur eyes Alpharad looks kinda lke hamination
MARK THOMPSON!?
Slime seems like a great DM. I was particularly impressed by all the improvised clay monsters. That’s the sort of thing you can’t possibly write in advance and account for every outcome.
That Naruto reference goes crazy
Tholemu (I think that’s how you spell it) is relatable. I also play the bagpipes and can confirm that they do send out a thunderous shock wave
The adventure time reference I love it 10:22
is that vox machina i never noticed
Luap=Paul and Paul=luap
Language.....  Some things are better not to
The laughs after the acid blast I CAN'TT 😭
Me every time i hearxthe phrase "time loop": when the hell did undertale get here?
WHEN CAN I PLAY THAT CAMPAIJG OMG
This is by far the best dnd short I've watched I had so much fun
This Hass to be a series starring these three characters
Oh! Paul was what Zuut bumped into
We need another DD adventure this was awesome!
You can easily tell when characters rolled 1😂
4:14 FUECOCO IN THE BACKGROUNDDD
You think that's wired, my party is comprised of a warforged who has a baby who can move at the speed of light but only with cinommion, the other one got his daughter taken away due to child neglect, and is some how a jedi, one eats glue out of game,one's a pick man, and I am a cop hating artificer and rouge, and the rest of the party are cops. That is a normal game of dnd for us, and I think the war forged is a jujitsu sorcerer who wants a doimn expiation at level 13. The others have committed galactic genocide and tax fraud, we went in to some big balck balls aka orbs or balck hole orbs, and I almost caused space 9/11, oh and the other guys nuked earth to oblivion and now there is no more earth
Jaiden The image of the dragon character is very helpful. It fits her nature perfectly.
why do i think you should have made your or someone elses character yell "FALL" and they just fall to the core of the earth
am i the only one who sawa bong water for a name lmaooo also i want to see more dnd its funny and animated
If I got a Vr or a x box and a pic there’s a game called sea of thieves
I once played a really short DND kinda side quest with my friends (imagination rules) and let me tell you, me and my friend not only were able to conquer a country the size of Asia and Europe combined, but we did all of that using mainly charisma and intimidation, getting many nat 20s with it.
I'm in my first campaign and I have no clue what to do 😅
But what about the turtle-
As a person that played dnd I can confirm that the lore and actions is kinda like this
Luap=paul
The vox machina cameo XDDDD
AWESOME ending
Can you PLEASE do another, longer campaign? I DESIRE MORE.
try a whole campain
One time a member of my party kept correcting me because I called homonids (early humans) monkeys so I started calling them fish because all Vertebrates came from Fish
One time a member of my party kept correcting me because I called homonids (early humans) monkeys so I started calling them fish because all Vertebrates came from Fish
the scroll is just a mix of sllightly altered japanese characters right
Never would have thought Jaiden was going to become susie from deltarune
I like dnd too I have a character named sora the dragonborn she is a lightning dragon and is a barbarian and I have never played her personality is playful sort of crazy and
make more d&d videos
16:30  😈 es el momento de llenar la jarra
hahahahhaha, it was really fun .:D
This was a really fun video!!!!!
Please do another one
Storytime of our DND meet last week: There was a tsunami headed for the village town we were in, and our Paladin could only teleport a few people, so he gave an invincible bubble to our rat sorcer to float in (which we dubbed "the hamster ball"), and as he floated around he found an old man. Trying to assist him, he rolled a nat 1 with a -1 modifier, meaning he essentially had a 0. He failed so hard he accidentally summoned the god of Mercy, Life, and Light, and became a paladin. Im a cleric, and me and our other Paladin are apart of the death order, so hearing this was absolutely hilarious, especially since we also have a Tiefling Samurai who is a literal demon (we were laughing on the other side of the table the whole time)
I absolutely love dnd even tho i never played it i play something called guerre et quête (yes i talk french)
Wait a minute if they are to be forever mortal, then they wouldn’t die and by definition become immortal
No way that this is 5e its way too fun for that
AM I THE ONLY STRANGER THINGS FAN THAT GOT SUMMONED??
This one time in d&d my friend (kid Goku) was fight master Roshi and was about to win but his friend (gojo) gave him you know the meme and then got destroyed by master Roshi then kid Goku started to giddy on him and gained heath I was not there😭😭
There were pokemon in the backround of the forest
It isn't D&D unless its 1e!
WOOOOOOOOOOO!
I actually love d&d so much 😊
THE POO BRAIN HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME AT THE GOBLIN CAMP OMG
Why did u make alpharad Larry
"everyone i've met loves dnd." IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE FRIENDS WITH A BUNCH OF NERDS!!! HA!!!    (pretty sure you've met me before)
Hi Jaiden, love your work btw, I was wondering if you could give me any tips. You see see I want to start trying out dungeons and dragons, but I don't know where to start do you?
Cream corn guy
i never have played dungeons and dragons before somehow :|
amazing
my teacher talked about this today
" And starts a casual conversation" *Gets an ad*
i think its great, i just started a campaign with my friends i picked a dragonborn aswell lol
This was a freaking riot! 🤣
How do you create lore with a card game I understand how she can do it with Pokémon games but d and d
Hmm, pondering life
None of this resembles any kind of D&D I know of, but I like it!
I like Tholomew’s design please make plushies of him and the others.
“Don’t listen to him, he’s a zebra.”
Jeiden'animeson is how to say Jaden animations in Japanese
I like dnd well enough but every time I’ve played it, it take soooo long to do anything.
haha
OH MY - this is one of the best dnd game stories I ever listened to
4:14 FUECOCO?
My dad played DnD. But i, have never played it.
I was expecting  "and you Paul....@#$% you Paul"
9:53 THE HORSE COSTUME THAT ICE KING WAS HIDING IN FROM ADVENTURE TIME
Yassss I was waiting for jaiden and ranboo to collab!
"Oh, hey there neighbour, (oh and Paul) it's me your good friend...." oh my god it's RON STAMPLER!        Marc Thompson.  Oh yeah, that makes more sense.
Amazing
Amazing
This is just :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Barthalowmew hit metal seventeen times      Puppies 🐶
1:35 seconds in and I already know who's character is who
B e s t m o v i e E V E R
I love Zoot. They're so silly.
We need a sequel.
My first time playing DnD and I GET SHOVED INTO DOORS!!!
an "oak" tree? THATS MY NAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
What is the name of the song at the start
This was PHENOMENAL! 🤣
did they ever say why the heck Zuuk came along?
15:11 *zuuk hugging Mark Thompson* also zuuk *acid blasting Mark's face*
the biep sounds of the bomb trigger me so bad because it matches the sound to my alarm clock
I LOVE DND!!!
I would love a part 2 also great video 😁
I love d&d its better than games
VOX MACHINA REDERENCE YAYY
i love how this felt more like a movie rather than like a youtube video
Oh god😓
Jacob is just Larry, but sadder
DEPRESSION BE SAD NOW AND THINK LIFE IS HORRIBLE Also when will u he posting those dnd highlights?
I love D&D
I really loved this video! I know it might be hard but hopefully you can keep doing these
i love D&D
Jaden is Toge Inumaki from jjk
Please do more like this. This was amazing.
Wow I got destroyed by 3 goblins due to my bad luck
13:40 Nah bro really did the obito 💀💀💀
My players rold a nat 20 fart
That is an elite session of dnd
This was the way I beat the big bad I rolled a nat 20
Imagine when your playing DND and then someone thinks of a boss that is literally a time god
ITS WORMIN TIME 🔥
YO IS NOBODY GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT THERE WAS VOCSMACINA THAT WAS SICK THANKS JAIDEN FOR DOING THAT :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
I had a pet rat in D&D and I named it Ratrick.
I really hope to see a part 2 if not an outright animated series out of this, it's always fun to watch animated videos of peoples DND stories cause they're always so unhinged in the best way possible.
I drew you :D (it’s kind of bad)
cintinue this campaign!!!
15:32
“Pulls back to look into marks eyes, which are sparkling with tears… (slow music plays)… Then proceeds to acid blast him, point blank from the mouth.” @15:23
When I tried d&d I was able to make a elmo voise so I was elmo that was able summon an army of elmos and I didn't need to eat or drink so I was broken as heck but I almost died to a chicken
you should do a Pokémon mystery dungeon DND campaign sounds like you'd like it
They litterally made marks ex wife have my name💀💀
Arguably, Paul is the best character
If I played d&d, the only attack I would do in the entire dungeon is “I consume (insert enemy name here)”
OHHHH MY GOODNESS ranboo as a tabaxi (?) makes me so happy lol, im playing one in my current campaign rn and the feline agility trait is actually so busted
+1 subscriber
Please do more of these i love this and i love watching this, like i love it so much its my most watched in my downloads ❤❤❤
why does paul dead ass look like sanji
IT'S WORMIN' TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was my first oneshot too!!
13:39 obito?
Chuckles will know
It’s amazing
I've watched jaiden for years and to see a new kind of video made me smile and laugh so much,loved it do this again
Wait isn't this from a show 1:15
I love how the fake horse that ice king uses to spy on fin and Jake in adventure time is being cooked by the goblins!
You chose favorite race, Dragonborn
Love the videos big fan
How many of those events actually happened in the game and what was added by Jaiden to spice it up a little?🤔
16:52 Plot twist of the decade!🤯
16:03 The Stick of Truth.😉
15:31 That authentic laughter was probably recorded from their game itself.🤣
Have you notices how often Jaiden uses music from Mario & Luigi games?🤔🎶
0:34 Totally understandable. Usually, you shouldn't try to force people to subscribe to your channel.😉
0:07 In fact, my younger sister actually holds D&D game sessions at a regular basis.😉🐲🎲
How long did this session take?
The fact my dnd character wouldn't have existed if I haven't of seen this-
Was Paul just Yoshikage Kira
i want to play dnd but i dont know anyone who does
Zoot is like a mirror-universe Susie. And the design and expressions are so great.
Unsure if you're a Critter by nature or just are in the know now that you know. But VM? Noice.
"Luap" I didnt even know that meant "Paul" lol
The mark part made me cry😢
Paul solongay bowswers laop??😭💀💀
Why d&d though
Yes
Can you play DND without friends?
I had a class where my teacher ran a class where we played DnD its was epic, 5 days a week and took a whole quarter 12 weeks and we didnt even finish fully
I played d&d for 3 years straight 😅
AND PROCEDES TO VOMIT ACID FROM HER MOUTH🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆
why's Paul kinda...
a b z
d and d
ISNT THAT THE PONY FROM AVDENTURE TIME 9:51
Her:I’ve never played dnd till now Me:I’ve known it since birth!!!!!!
I wanna pt2
I love how no-one explains the significance of the wand or why mark wants it, it's just there.
MR LARRY?!
The adventure time references is wild
what class is Jaiden
I will pay money to listen to an D&D podcast of this group
I didnt even notice the vox machina reference while watching this the first time. very cool little easter egg thingy :)
Not a DnD player, just saw someone playing it get into what I'm about to tell.  The partu was in a tebern, got what they needed, but the DM said spmething along the lines of "As you're about to leave, you feel something. Roll for perception?" Naturally, they said yes. And then the funniest troll happened, as a person seemingly from another timeline similar to ours was making a video about peoplewatching where the first person to realize they've been watched would get OP equipment and stats. So why was this a troll? The party had been peparing to unalive the BBEG this whole time, and actually wasted all the money they had used prior to that event since with everything laid out for them they didn't have to use anything they just bought
There's this smaller version of D&D called D&D World. Me and my whole class of like 8 or 9 people played it. It was hectic because it wasn't supposed to be that big of a party, but whatever. The beginning is yours was much different than mine. We were in a city just walking around and one of the girls in my group was using charisma on everyone and everything she saw 😂
I can't believe you guys got Larry from Pokemon in your game
I love charlies design as dungeon master its sooo good 👍
FUNNNNIIIIIIII!!! YoU've got your self a suB
I’m sorry, but…  Shark: Roll for persuasion Tsunami: twenteh Shark: you may pass
i remember seeing a Voltron D and D reference in one of the episodes (Voltron is a show on Netflix)
Why does the door sound like Bryson?
Best short movie ive ever seen do more plz!
Imagine if they do a part 2 8t would be funny
Nah but my item ideas are wacky for example the throwing greatsword
It’s great to see you’re finally trying the “World’s Greatest Roleplaying Game”!
Cursed speech? 😕
15:56  100% a nat 1 on that roll
got any grapes
Im confused what is zoot's class 😭😭😭
0:17  is wild
Can you do a second video of this pls
I’ve been using this as a reference for my campaign. The only thing is that one of the players is an overpowered monk who can deal 90 damage in one hit (he’s level 1)
Gravity falls
Depression
I was watching this with my friend and he said out of nowhere ”the cat and pal would be a good ship” and I just look at him like “😨”
Me and my party have only had one session yet, but it's straight up hilarious how I can already spot every nat 1 and unnecessary crits in this story. Gosh, I love dnd
14:09 such a Jaiden thing to do 😂
15:21-15:39 Good one there😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 How long have the the others been laughing outside the game?
Did everyone just not notice that Alpha design is based on Larry from Pokémon, scarlet violet?
7:58 The crown ranboo made with the T on it  was a tribute to technoblade no one can convince me otherwise-
Hey uhh jaiden can you make some more d&d content cuz it’s sound fun and cool                 👇                 Keep up the good work
Bro dis animated is awesome
Please please please make more of these DnD sessions.  That was awesome.
Same never played it
Øøø
I remember my first dnd campaign- I was a tired human bard in her 40's named Thalia who hated her job but needed to keep playing for tax purposes. At one point a group of assasains attacked a tavern we were staying at but my party took care of them pretty quickly, knocking out half and uno reversing the occupations of the other half. There was one left and Thalia tossed a knife into his leg and he really took that personally i guess because turns out the main villain of the whole thing was that one guy that Thalia tossed a knife at and he became a vessel to the Raven Queen just so he can make Thalia suffer even though she literally did one thing during that entire battle. Fun times.
Did mark pull a Tobi and do the arm wave teleport thing?
Jacob being just a normal guy in a fantasy world is absolutely hilarious.
15:26 And proceeds to acid blast him point blank from the mouth 🤣
16:29 NOT THE JAR
Wait at the end scene of them walking off with the explosions behind them where was Paul jr?! (The turtle)
I love that fact that Jays character is just him in a sit, with the pheonix wrieght Haircut
i want to know HOW CAN İ PLAY THİS?
Love the Vox Machina Easter egg at the beginn8ng and Alpharad’s character gives me Larry from Pokémon vibes
2. Session PLEASE
Jaiden you should do part 2
Rambo
Vox machina
15:41 up there goes goes gravity up there goes rabbity...
I love the vox machina reference at the start
I started playing this in 88 I think back then it wasn't cool and I'm still Loving the fact that it's become mainstream😅
Tomark? he he
Ah, DnD. I remember my first campaign with my older brother. I accidentally blew up the entire country with a full necklace of fire beads. A single fire bead has a 30 ft radius, basically a grenade. So a full necklace was like a nuke. So... I accidentally caused fallout in my campaign. 😂😂😂
OK is anybody going to answer that Jaden makes good videos that makes games look good and when you play it, it’s absolutely garbage who can agree
PARTTT 2
The acid blast moment is sooooo Jaiden 😂
Did anyone else recognize that horse, the goblins were eating pretty sure that’s the one from adventure time
Anyone else notice the sheep has the little asriel haircut?
Please do more sessions and make more of these videos
Not me watching this 3 times
This is without a question my favorite video yet. I need a DnD Series now 😭😭
Moree
Maybe you should do the subscribe thing once in a while. It made me look and I was like wait… I’m not subscribed?
I love that Mark is the Broomstache man that almost ran over Rebecca in a too-expensive car.
grog, pike, keyliff, and vex, did no one catch this 7 months ago. im behind the time but still.
6ES PAUL
I really liked your channel uni til you got inappropriate I’m really disappointed
This is amazing🌟🌟  can't wait to see session 2
More pld
We NEED PART 2!
Paul is giving off higuruma vibes fo sho
Can you make a new dnd video
Anyone notice a Vox Machina reference at 1:12 onward?
0:56 furry jaiden
0:37 Don't feel too weird. This honestly prodded me into subscribing after having watched several of your videos.
Hello
Next Thing: “An Animator That Has 2 Guns.”
1:21 jerry I thought you died in the campaign
16:35 Does anyone know what song this is, please, i am very desperate
Love the good old tavern start with a sheep and a scroll
Vox Machina ref! 1:13
We need a sequel to this
Totally not half a year late, but anyway, in my first time playing I got pixies out of the way with chalk
Luap flips Paul Jaiden and them:OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH*Had me Dying💀
Jacob just turms into larry from pokemon S&V.
Love the Vox Machina reference (Nobody else seems to notice) 1:14
Try lucid dreaming so you can *Really* play D&D
This seems fun
16:19 okay that was funny
WHAT'S THE CAMPAIGN?!?!
wait a minute am i slow or when there naming the turtle is there a jojo reference
Like the legend of Vox Machina reference that show was really good
The lore dump is so real
I like how Mark is Larry from S/V
She actually got to play with the legendary Charlie Slimecicle. CREATOR OF JORT STORM.
loved the vox machina cameo
Loved the Vox Machina art at 1:15 ❤️❤️
i love all of the easter eggs in this haha
One time me and my party of 12 went into a tavern in the middle of the night and we met a cursed suit of armor that came alive and hit me in the balls so I used my acid spell to disintegrate it’s finger and someone committed arson and we had to leave and I bought some cheese and stole a goat, running into the sunset with my new companion, Erogog
I subbed
9:13 AWHHhHH
W animation
15:19 I started crying 😭✋
I knew Alpharad would choose something so hilarious 😂
I love TTRPG's , thank you for do this animation :)
1:16 is that a Voc Machina easter egg?
i just want a part 2 of this a chaos group aventure
I keep coming back to this video.  I’d absolutely love to see you and more friends in these animated abridged versions of those stories.
4:16, Over the garden wall reference? Behind the turtle
dnd jaiden: curse speech
Bro that was incridble il loved it and i do play D&D what a masterclass
10:57  Is he here?👀 *fades away in the shadows*
I really like your story Jaiden.
This is honestly better than most movies
PARTSSS 2222
This was wild😂
I hate how I can tell the DM is the kinda DM that's like "you rolled a 1 so you attack yourself" and it's the most stupid thing ever. Glad you had fun, but holy fuck, I'd hate to be at that table.
4:33 is that a jojo reference
16:30 WHAT IS THAT BANGER SOUNDTRACK???
I’d recognize that horse anywhere… 9:51
Me if I had the wand: AVADA KADAVRA!!!!!!
I love the reference to Vox Machina in the inn
I only like Low Budget RPG  Magic The Noah’s Version
WE NEED ANOTHER ONE RN! PLSSSS!
9:07 they don't even know that Jaidens oc is choking
Almost everybody loves dungeons and dragons. It's like one of the best fantasy games ever.
10:45 Is it just me or do I see a certain symbol used in the 1940’s by a dictator?
at 1:35 its funny he asks do you know mark and my uncle mark plays dnd with my dad :}
the character was just : animal, a random depress busines man, another animal but smaller
ranbo the minecraft youtuber?
Here 6 months later to kindly ask if the potential turtle name at 4:33 “Mr. President” is an intentional or unintentional JoJo’s reference. Is it?
I went to the zoo the other day it only had one animal it was a dog. It was a pretty Shih Tzu.
Does anyone species Ranboo was playing?
The peller
Luaps name shouldve been RJ Luap lol
I wish i had dnd 😔
rewatching this again. did you swear under your breath after the riddle door gave the worm hint?
I’ve always wanted to play D&D but I don’t have friends😢
JACOB IS JUST LARRY POKEMON
Music: Mario and Luigi super star saga. Super mario galaxy
Girl, i saw The Beast from Over the Garden Wall in that treeline and i was shook! Greay inclusion lol
YouTube life hack play more D&D make more videos about DND infinite content
I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE THIS SCREEN POP UP ON MY YOUTUBE PAGE, DND IS LIFE!
All I thought about when I heard Mark Thomson was that one video  where Markiplier played Phasmophobia and he’s just constantly saying “MARK THOMPSON, MARK THOMPSON, MARK THOMPSON, MARK THOMPSON”
I saw the vox machina at the start there I see what you did
Out of all their characters Ranboos character is my favourite its a cat my favourite animal and it is black and white my favourite colour combo
I like your older videos more
Paul gives me nanami vibes for some reason
I have never wanted to play dnd so bad. NEVER. there is something about this that really gives me a new goal in life.
I want to play dungeons and dragons when I watched this video
I want to Dungeons and Dragons all over the place now.
6:06 my answer was tectonic plates lol
You should try pirate borg or Ose dnd
Is that music from Wind Waker? Sounds familiar
Dude i i fell so bad fo Mark, he got left because That Cat was stupid😭
Mark aint do nothint wrong.
So funny
Heh i play dnd lol
Jaiden ur completely opposite of me. I can almost never find people to play a good game of dnd with
beep beep
Beautiful
Not for nothing I’ve seen a few of your animations over the years and I think it would be hilarious to see you collaborate with “Tales From the Stinky Dragon” and animate some of their dnd adventures 😂😂
I ADORE THIS BUT WHAT IS THE MUSIC AT THE END ITS BEEN BUGGING ME FOR EVER 😭
ITS WORMIN TIME 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🗣️🔥🔥🪱🪱🪱🪱
Depression is the most broken Ability ever 💀💀
I million likes and jaiden needs to do part 2 if she wants
As a girl named Ella I can confirm I’m Mark’s ex wife         Also the fact Paul threw his son several times is hilarious
i heard charlie as DM and immediatly went "oh no. OH YES"
12:00 IS THAT THE GOLDEN BOUGH FROM LIMBUS COMPANY?
me too i never played d and d
As a veteran p&p rpg player, the whole thing looks pretty legit. We've all been there, and we've all loved it!
VOX MACHINA REFRENCE RAAAAAAH
my first idea for a character was also a dragonborn what can i say , great minds think alike
He looks like bryson for a reason
5:21 did anyone else here a fart sound effect in that explosion
Bro, it sounds like a story with c ai or story when I played with toys
THis was good
Paul looks like Larry from pokemon gen 9😅
Paul looks like
as soon as i confirmed the man on right was look like ranboo i clicked
ohh poor ice king 10:05 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Jaden I love your content but if you haven't watcht ranboo gene ration lost I don't know what you're doing are you living under a rock
what is the name of the cat ?
Normal dnd expirence somtimes IT is like in the magick the Noah the "i cast Tunder spell" meme
wow no mention of Grog, Pike, Vex and keyleth just casually hanging at the old oak inn.
I love to allow you to join one of our games in d&d you seem like a fun person to talk to
I'M A DRAGON BORN!
10:41 how it fells to butterknife a heavy as spy
We need you to do another one
People who want Jaiden to recognize their existence 👇
4:15 OTGW reference!! :)
THE VOX MACHINA CHARACTERS IN THE BEGINNING!!!!!!
An epic
"the group, now lost with no direction, decides, for some reason, to all start eating the clay."
the first time I played D & D I went with a group of people to board a boat. Big boat to expensive, and we didn't want the little boat so we put a barrel on top of the gnome shop keeper and put the small boat on it. We crushed the gnome and everyone took turns trying to reserect it by rolling a 10. Fun times
Me and my friends are playing (im the dm) and I made them go into a cryp where they found a crystal they touched it and got sent back in time time to give them a panic attack with ptsd
1:16 never knew I needed vox machina in this animation style, but now...
1:39 "I am Yoshikage Kira, I'm 33 years old and live in mori-"
I loved this hope to see more (no rush) but i looked through all of your channels looking for the real one like u daid and it's not their 6 Months later  Remember no rush just a bit sad, but animation is hard so your fine
Jaiden you should do another video of your experiences in D&D
Paul:finds a rock immediately gets mailed by a mountain lion 😂
"Hey are you guys new here?"  " *I wish I was* "
This was amazing!😂
That...  that is a DM having to improvise HHHHEAVILY, on the fly!  😂😂😂
Hey, MYYY NAMESSS CHARLIEEEEE
Yay she joined the cult
I love playing d&d but this must be the best d&d campaign I've ever seen
When Jaden uses his acid on Mark when I watched it I literally made the loudest scream in my house is
Bryson
"I wish I was" had me dead
Bow do you
Now I want to play
WE NEED MORE FEED US MORRREEE
WE NEED THE REAL RECORDING OF THIS LOL
I was watching this at night and the door freaked me out lol
I wanted to name my Orc barbarian Dictator Windslash😂
I fucking love that Paul's design is just Jacob dressed as Larry from Pokemon S&V.
I saw the avengers time horse
I like DND too
I love the legend of vox machina reference at the beginning
this video was blessed by a pikmin bloom ad
this video was awesome
It’s hit 500 K likes
EYYYYY CRITICAL ROLE REF!!!!
Oh brother she’s a scaly
I’m currently in the blader’s gate role play
I player Hot Wheels unleashed 2 Turbocharged ❤
Is that horse from adventure time
i sometimes play dnd, its fire
I can imagen someone doing an edit of this when the sheep smashes through coconut mall just goes up by 32 decibels
This was a awesome video I watched at the perfect time 😁
I'd burn the hollow tree inn down
more dnd vids pls this was amazing
So Jakob just channeled his inner Larry huh
i love how she animates games like pokemon and others
In one of my first sessions, our group yelled "shit" in elvish while the sorcerer casted a thunder speel and then I (an air genasi) used my power to float surrounded by my party imitating a religious procession so I basically tricked a village to think I was their god.
I like how vox Machina is just chilling at the beginning
ITS WORMIN TIME
Riddle door NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
DND on crack, you demonstrated it amazing! I should try it sometime…
the peeling
is there a Vod of the one shot as it would be funny to see this
This is like a rp but on real life
VOX MACHINA
I love D&D!
VOXX MACHINAAA
I love D&D have a great time playing it
14:19 "I miss my wife tails. I miss her a lot"
she dident even mention when satan literaly told her to still the wand
Whats the music thats playing in the background here 8:19
The Groups reaction to Jaiden just Acid splashing Mark after pulling at his heart strings by disguising himself as Mark’s wife
Wait I’m gonna cry what a beautiful story Charlie wrote
8:23 ITS WORMING TIME!
I’m a child and I have DND!
If i were to make a clay monster we'd be doomed id make roxxane wolf
So goood😊😊 keep it up
Is it just me or when Paul was turned into a zebra there was a little fart sound effect?
“Don’t Listen To Him He’s A Zebra” had me rolling
wow cool
I saved my group when playing D&D for the first time! My character was a white tiger named winter that can shape shift into other animals! we were trying to break into some building like some sort of bar  or some thing and we couldn’t get caught I don’t quite remember 😅 but there are some guys feeling suspicious where we were hiding and if we got caught the game was over! so I decided to turn into a mouse and distracted people and make them think that it was just a little mouse! it worked and we were saved! that was one of the best bonding experiences with my cousins! : D
What's the music used for the goblin fight?
C’mon Vox Machina shout out
@jaiden add me on social media
My dnd character would probably a clown called fudgles and chuckles the clown
we had an avatar in our party
Is it just me or does dnd sound much more fun on youtube
I love the Legend of Vox Machina reference at the start!
D&D adventures: I was in a campaign with 5 of my friends, 4 players 1 dm. We are fighting against big bugs, and i decide "Its the perfect time to use an aoe spell" I could hit 4 of the main enemies with it... but one of my friend would be hit aswell so i ask him to say how much hp he has. After he refuses to tell me for the 4th consecutive time i just use it, I kill all 4 enemies and the dm asks me "How do you want them to die?" And my friend in question that refused to tell me his hp says "You can also describe how i die because i f-ing got destroyed" The dm asks how much hp had before the attack, my friend tells him, he leaves the call, after 10 minutes he returns and says "Lets just say he dodged last second" We all agreed. 💀 (he survived at 1 hp, trust)
Alpharad is literally Larry.
my dream plots be like:
THE REAL CHARLIE SLIMESICKLE LOVES DND??? MY DREAM HAS COME TRUE HES THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hey you got that from groundhog day
At 4:15 there was a “over the garden wall” reference
what your 2nd chanle called
Yesterday I did my first round of DnD:  First thing we did, we encountered a water elemental, and we adopted it. Then we had a custody battle over it, only for it to chose someone else, and then I got ambushed by skeletons and I dodged their attacks like I had ultra instinct, we fought a Slime Boss, we yeeted our water baby into it, it absorbed the slime, and became a big boy.  Then at the end, I yeeted one of my party members in the ocean.
🤣 always funny stuff. more funny stuff.
Lol I like that you added vox machina in the tavern.
I watched the Party Crashers (if you know them,you know them) play DnD on the channel Magic The Noah and i lost my tears and voice from laugh at the infinity of peak comedy,DnD is try a delight for those who seek peak comedy
0:48 sanji san
Gotta love the vox Machina reference
Omg i was rewatching this and i just noticed the vox machina reference! That soo cool
i just realized you said name theirs. is your character genderless like fwench fwy?
My favorite part is that you can definitely tell when someone rolled a Nat 1
This is rayqazs point blanck hyper beam to dioxis moment on dnd form
Anybody else notice the adventure time pony?
15:37 IMG I LOVE THIS SONG 💗💗💗💗💗
7:30 Why the hell did i actually felt that
yoooo legends of vox idk how to spell it
I’m guessing the moral of the story is “if your boss is a jerk, turn him into a worm”
More
Larry and Paul must come from the same world.
I CANT BREATH THIS IS TOO FUNNY
HOLY HELL I JUST REALISED ITS VOX MACHINA AT THE START OF THE VIDEO IN THE TAVERN
15:32 , LOOK AT THEIR FACES, LMAO
6:56 turtle final answ-
1:15 where are percy and… vex? Vax? Idk i still cant tell which one is who after watching the show twice
This whole thing was hilarious. I'm slowly learning how to play D&D myself.  15:33 - Ranboo and Charlie laughing so hard is so in character.
While I would LOVE to see the IRL highlights, I loved watching this and imagining how it went down.
What about the turtle did he get exsploded?!
THIS WAS AMAZING
I love the Vox Machina reference
This made me watch your channel again
Thank you I understand dnd more now and was a big fan of it and would watch it while I drank at home the stories where so amazing until I heard this one and it being your first. I have been wanting to try dnd and I am afraid of not playing it right. But this video encouraged me to try and I would like to some time soon. I want to have the same experience you had a wonderful and fun time. Thank you so much for this video.
this truly encapsulates the fun and chaos of dnd. i love how your DM managed to have everything wrap up nicely!   one of the things our DM always does is gives the NPCs celebrity lookalikes so we got a quest from george clooney, stayed at a sketchy inn run by danny devito, found a zombie that looked like dehydrated adam driver, fought a sorcerer benedict cumberbatch… it makes going through my doodles of the campaign so much sillier
that cheeky wink to Vox Machina there :P
my first time playing dungeons and dragons was hell
absolutely hilarious and cute story, glad you were able to share this with us!!
4:16 Over the Garden Wall reference?   Coincidence? I think not.
s a d n e s s
this was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
s h e e p
c a t
More DND PLZ
this vidio was sooo cool can you do plece more of this
You should do DnD again. It think it would be way better then the first one.
wait what the f- 0:20
I love the part when the worm went "It's Wormin Time!" and wormed all over the place
The 1 st sentence sums up my character  (My DnD master hates me)
I love this so much!!!!
My child asked me to draw them a Dragonborn with Black Dragon elements before they headed off to school. When they got home, I showed them my progress. child: "They don't like to wear cloths." me: "What? Since when?" child: "Here, let me show you."  child opens this video, we watch it together me, laughing: "Okay, but this doesn't explain why dragonborn don't like to wear cloths?" child: "Oh, that's true." me: "Do you know what you want your dragonborn to wear?" child: "No, I only asked because I wanted to show you the video!"   ^_^
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome THE DM IS A FRAUD GIVE ME BACK MY CHARACTER SHEET
JAIDEN FINALLY DID D&D WOOOO
Do more of these videos please
Lol what an adventure
WHO NOTICES ARI AND FUECOCO ANYONE OR JUST ME
Guys we got coconut malled
zoot has a blep spell
So how do you start? Do you need to know someone who plays? I need info
First time playing D&D and already committing war crimes, girl is a natural!
Did anyone catch onto the Adventure Time reference? The little purple horse Ice King disguises himself as to spy on Finn and Jake
Not Jaiden becoming Ella the wife 😂
Was it DnD online?
The fkng tiny violen playing the world's sadist song lmao. This is why I love animatics.
"Is to look at his eyes" "Then proceeds to acid blast him" SUCH A SWEET GUY😊
Eating the clay... what kind of smooth brained D&D session is this 😂
THIS was your first adventure??? LOL... I cannot wait to hear about your second session.
Omg I loved it❤
You can easily tell when somebody roles a 1
I regret gatekeeping myself from this video, it’s funny as shiet
I love thi. DO IT AGAIN.
As a DnD players I can help but sigh and face smack myself onto a desk. I can't imagine playing like this with all the silliness. You see my usual style of play is actual fantasy world realistics. Yes I know two words that conflict with one another. But this was so out of range of usual DnD that is was just off putting at so many angles. no wonder modern DnD is just so....short ended with everything.
Also Paul reminds me of alpharad
We need another campaign
Play more please also, reply what your favorite character you've played as is! (name, level, race, class, alignment.) I'll start. Her name is Kai, and she's a level 8 half-elf wizard. Kai's alignment is chaotic good. However, she doesn't care and claims to be a Sorceress for craps and giggles, no other reasoning.
Please anyone I’m begging please
Alpharad look like Nanami from jjk
Im very glad you made a video of this, this was super fun XD
Zoot having the energy of a dog who likes simple things and answers is a entire mood And also the tattoo on the tongue for spells is AWESOME   I wont lie it kinda reminded me of black butler- but I love Black Butler so complimentive / it isnt a frequently used design i see often . But it is odd it happened twice
Whats hilarious is i thught Luap was such a cool sheep name i didnt see the ending coming LOL
1:55 lmao okay discount pokemon larry 😂 i love em already ❤   The mentioning of random background characters with no context is perfect DnD banter
The vox machina reference was so fire 🔥
Bad RNG on Jaden's part lol
I've done this one shot before and I really like the way they changed it up! I might need to do a few changes myself next time I run this
D&D for the W
Thals face on 13:37...where have i seen that before? 🤔🧐🤨🧐
This is a work of art
Paul is tragic sheesh
Yeah yeha but WHERE DID PAUL JUNIOR GO AFTER TYEY DEFEATED THE CLAY STATUES
Loved that ending XD
Can you do another d&d video?
Why do I feel bad for mark 😢
Why does Paul look like Larry from Scarlet and Violet
Now I saw that you draw Vox Machine and they look so great!
9:13 Jaiden...I don't feel so good...
10:04 was that the donkey from adventure time? Which turned out to be ice king????
16:51 wait if the sheep was his son wait.. HE THROWED HIS SON!
‘Zute just blasts his face off point blank with acid blast’ just had me dying and we just gonna ignore the fact that alpha is just Larry but with a battle axe and extra lore/trauma
She looks back just far enough to look into his eyes, and proseeds to asid blast him in the face
12:35   he became Obito
I'm rewatching this again and I completely missed the Legend of Vox Machina reference
Please make this a series.
Lmao. As a DM, I know the exact module y'all ran. A modified version of "A Wild Sheep Chase". It's a blast. A fun zany adventure. The original module doesn't have the mud puzzle or magical doors, for anyone else that wants to run it
omg adventure time reference spotted I'm getting hooked again. boutta binge watch every single video that I've missed on over the years
What the heck it sounds like that was a love story to get married to a goblin you think that sounds fun. It sounds like selling your life away like an idiot with a contract that says the fine print is you have to give me your soul
Paul remind me of the normal type paldea gym leader
Wou
I really hope they do another one shot with the same characters because this sounds like it was so much fun to play and it was so much fun to watch
9:53 hehehe adventure time horse go brrrrrrr
Jaiden really went “but if you do think that’s fun then hey” caught me off-guard
So fun and entertain 😂😂😂❤❤
I've never clicked on a video without hesitation before. A video with jaden, ranboo, and Slime in it is absolutely amazing
I see that Vox Machina reference
With the opening of the quest starting with a sheep bursting into a tavern with a Scroll of Speak with Animals, I legitimately thought this was going to be them playing the one-shot adventure "The Wild Sheep Chase", one of my favorite one-shot adventures for parties that enjoy some chaos.  Was surprised to see that didn't seem to be the case at all.
15:21 just watch
Mark has no beef with Paul yet. Paul has beef Mark.
I love the vox machina reference
This is not what I expected I thought you would tell us what your first game of dnd was like but I'm definitely not mad it was much cooler to just be suddenly along for the ride nice job.
Late comment here…but I have a riddle… If you have me you’ll see things normally, if not you’ll see things “clearly”… What am I? (Hint: has nothing to do with glass)
0:53 Charlie seems like the kind of guy who could play a great scientist role like Ford from Gravity Falls. If you look at him, you’ll see that he’s very fit for that role. Great video 10/10.         *Blue Lobster Jumpscare.*
We need those highlights!
This needs to be a series! Excellent work!
My D&D character is also a dragonborn! My little brother doesn't find interested in it though, but my dad on the other hand, my dad loves playing D&D, I would if he would like to play a game with me
I love dungeons and dragons my dad, me and his roommate Played DND with an AI in like literally one of my weapons was a literal katana
ITS WORMIN TIME ‼️‼️‼️‼️
waiiiiit a minute...  do all funny smash brothers youtube content creators know each other...? also, shoutouts to larry. also also x2 nice use of the mario and luigi music AGAIN. friggin that's my weakness. Mario music always makes me happy.
Ranboo reminds me of husk from Hazbin hotel
Anyone else think Paul looks a little bit like Larry from Pokémon?
boyl the only goblin survivor
i woke up, went to the subathon and saw the ella-jaiden moment and was so confused
im so happy i guessed it was earthworm before anyone said anything
I love how you have Nox Machima there. XD
But why the turtle 😢😂
My dnd party also has a cat person bard
Paul has like nanami vibe and cool uncle vibe too (if you didn't know who nanami is he's from jjk the anime)
Does anyone know the music that plays in the background at 16:32?
I think D&D is perfect for this channel honestly, animation needing story and story that could always benefit from being told visually, just an ideal combination.
Basically we have played duengon and dragon but it is kind a sus 😅
I'm can't tell who the villains of this story are.
I just love how you can see exactly when the rolled well and when they just rolled absolutely horribly lmao
Love the Vox Machina cameo
I think it would have been better if the video was narrated like in all of Jaiden's stories.
We need more animated dnd
Paul is a masterpiece character!
KITTY
DRAGON
love this
“If you can think of something, it can happen in a game” as a dnd player that is true. I had… fun… with a dragon and ended up in a marriage. For reference I had to save the party from a fight we could win. I was a bard okay?
Furry
I've never played dungeons and dragons but I've always wanted 5o, and I hope I can too
You got slimecicle as your first GM? Girl, you lucky little.. Man what a game night, id love to see a session or two in the future. ^^
10:11   When my friends and I try to expand our friend group
Adventure time, come on grab your friends, we’ll go to very, distant lands, with Jake the dog and Finn the human the fun will never end, adventure time! 9:51
Most normal d&d session
8:14 me vibing with the background music: 💃💃💃💃 (The headphone users know what I am talking about)
I noticed you put in deus ex machina in there 👌 nice touch
YOU ARE FRIENDS W RANBOO?!?!
I noticed there was a lot of maiden dragon born fan art at the end, but a disappointing amount of Paul fan art.
We need more
I really hope you can do more of this. I enjoy it. Thank you.
Bro when did d&d become realistic
Ah yes.. the party of Deltarune.
14:12 the depression spell is the funniest thing here
dude the Critical role references are great
yeah i really want to play D&D
I love the little Vox Machina cameo.
For anyone wondering the music starting at 12:27 is from pokemon ranger its called cargo ship. (I was looking for it desperatly so i thought i share this Informationen 😅)
Это было очень странно но и забавно
HAVE YOU MET ME BEFORE
What you did to the dark wizard is ssoo messed up.  XD LOL
The peeler 😂😂😂😂😂 lmao
This is the greatest film in cinematic history
THE TURTLE!!!!
Can anyone notice there's a meme during the clay worm
Paul Jr. was carrying, lets be honest 😂
I did not mean to send an alarm it was on accident please
I like dungeons and dragons that actually a good game surprisingly and I heard dungeons and dragons of dinosaur so that’s why I like it🐉🐉🦖🦞
I faked a heart attacked to get out of a conversation.
14:07 POV : jjk cursed speech be like
New style unlocked: super duper depressed man named Larry!
So, Jaiden...currently working on homebrew for D&D5E where one can play as a Pokémon for a player character.  Knowing how much you like Pokémon, interested in the Cliff Notes on what I have so far?
0:05 me: I am now a god
Loves this video 😂🙌
YOOO I SAW VOX MACHINA!
You enter a cave and you see James
I love how Paul is just kento nanami from Jujutsu kaisen😂
I got to the 15 min mark left and then 10 seconds into rewatching and the bad guy got acid blasted
The oger part, whaaat?
I’m your greatest enemy…         WALLMART MANAGER
That 'casual conversation' with Paul was one of the most intense dnd background stories I've ever heard. And also a very believable motivation for striking up a conversation at a bar. Venting. I also love how he asked if she knew his boss before saying anything that could get him in trouble.
That Vox Machina reference tho XD
9:13 Zoot: Hehe get acid'd you worm  Worm: *OOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-*
OMG I felt like I was watching a movie that was a fun adventure and I love DND
You drew the critical role characters! I love them, do you listen to their podcast? Or watch the show?
DM is not a God DM is above all Gods
the thing is that my friends would not play D & D :|
I've wanted to play DND but I have no friends to play with 😢
The Vox Machina in the beginning had me dying with laughter 😂
"PROCEED TO ACID BLAST HIM POINT BLANK-" biggest betrayal i've ever seen 💀
girl bye i remember the first time i played someone died by doing a backflip 😭
It’s the funniest thing. Jaden used depression on this man, and it worked perfectly take that depression
i love how when the door turned paul into a zebra they got the fart sfx
Wait a minute in 9:52 is that the horse from Adventure Time?The one who caused sleep problems to Finn and Jake?
Play rain world
Please make more if these
ples make more this is a awsome  dnd seshon you had
does anyone know the music at 12:27
4:14 FUECOCO
VOX MACHINA!?
WE NEED A PART 2!!!!
love it❤
I guess I should have expected to see Vox Machina guzzling ale in the bar.
2:26 Groundhog Day?
Hearing jaiden do all the voices somewhat gives me the avarage Character ai chat roleplay
So... is it just normal for people who are Aro/Ace to choose dragon born for their first/go-to dnd characters..?   CAUSE I CHOSE TO BE A DRAGON BORN FOR MY FIRST EVER GAME AS WELL...
I'd grilled that Sheep. Quickest Campaign ever
Y’all I literally can’t remember what Mark did anymore
I've never seen this game before
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
Dnd is very -chaotic- fun
The sheep getting so long gay bowser almost hospitalized me
I would honestly love to play dnd but all my friends call it weird so I don’t have anyone to play with :’(
Anyone know what the outro song is?
The Vox Machina Cameo was excellent!
My brother was playing with his dnd group and there was this door that was locked, and he seduced the door and it unlocked!!😂😂🤣🤣
My games have always been unhinged. But this is a different level of unhinged😂
I'm wheezing so hard right now the tiny violin gets me every time
are you going to animate the next session? because if so I'm supper excited to see it
I play Dungeons & Dragons and I'm just buff necromancer with hide armor at level 5
I just barely heard the wet fart sound effect when Paul was turned into a zebra
I loved it, I'm still learning English so I miss a couple of words 😂 but the history was amazing, I would like to watch more videos like this one
8:12 My dreams in a nutshell
hey jaiden do you know wings of fire if you don"t the READ THE BOOK SEARIS its amazing and im an artiest of wings of fire so let me know so i can draw you an oc
I played it and made a cat necromancer
That Obito goodbye was awesome
THAT WAS VOX MACHINA I KNOW IT
I love how you presented this! It was so fun to watch and felt like the episode of a show! Amazing job as usual!
It reminds me a bit of my first one shot where we were approached by a goat that could speak, he was a wizard turned into a goat by his apprentice who went power crazy and stole his wand. We battled the apprentince, took the wand and tried to use it to turn back the wizard. We failed, turned him into a pile of goo and that was the end
help i showed this to my friend and he said "yk pauls kinda..." and i agree, he kinda gives off pissed off nanami vibes and im here for it
If you like video games and dnd then play tiny tinas wonderlands, and if you like that play borderlands 2 tiny tina assault on dragon keep
You go girl.
Appreciate the Vox Machina cameo at the start
Ooh 5:22 I bet it would be a equation of which I have not a real grasp of but sort of can try to comprehend like where we are in the pretense that say the solar ssytem no forget it the universe instead/galaxy is a map but no longer flat,. Say the door is into the corrdinate of negative numbers,, if those were the things to exist.. because assuming we still consider zero a number for sake of having at least the one waypoint/bearings source at least for me.. fwiw that does seem fairly plausible for the door to be a numberline representation of the completely made up myself., wonder of if the doors a exit or really going into the exit vs out of the exit.. vs entereing.. since it is fwiw leaving where they currently are, to go to the.. well whats behind the door,  If say zero is ig ftw ngl ig a method of not losing sanity from not knowing where we are.. in ref to the universe etc.. or if we ignore gravity.. fwiw if that makes any sense.
AND YOU paul... any way
That was from adventure time 10:07
sounds like baldurs gate 3
WHY THE “BAAAAA” DID YOU TRY TO SPRAY ME WITH MACE?!
I love the vox machina reference at the beginning
I played d&d was fighting a displacer beast and missed all of my shots from my magic.
Omg I love the vox machina reference
I still remember my first session along with my friends. Our DM, a good friend, had been playing for years, yet us four had never even touched a D20 before. In our first session, in the beginning it was a bit awkward as we didn't know what to do. Our DM had put together the most simple mission she could think off, rescuing a local town's mayor from goblins. In the fight with the goblins is where our eyes opened. My friend, who played a bard dwarf, asked if he could jump off our wagon, use his shield as a skateboard to slam ontop of one of the goblins and then jam his flute down it's throat. We all was like "that would never work, that's crazy haha", but our DM went "Ye. Roll [...]" And he succeeded in doing it all, effectively killing the goblin. THAT was the moment we realised.. we can do anything? And since then we've been utter chaos gremlins and our DM wouldn't wish it any other way.
That was VILE
15:28-15:33 who guess
Soo who thought that guy that married the goblin is weird
oh my  f ing god jaidens a furry
Its funny how it felt like a failed charisma roll when you asked us to subscribe
this was awesome
dungeons a dragons 2
OMG, this was such a good story for your first D&D sesh. I laughed so many times! XD
Please this was the best video ever
Techno, Tubby, Tommy and Rambo r the only good Minecraft ytubers left
That last part was nice but then BGURIROIIFOKAJYHDIAJHGEHJIWLFJHGJHH
Who else found pikachu and fuecoco at 4:15
I unsubscribe
I'd love see more of the D&D I love hearing D&D stories and haven't had the chance to play it yet
Am I  the only one that can watch this not stop watching this over and over again?
I love this D and D video can you please do an another D and D video please
WHAT AN ADVENTURE!
why is paul actually just Larry the gym leader
Dude I ADORE the reference to Vox Machina at 1:15! Also please do more D&D! This is peak D&D and I’m here for it! Love your vids and I look forward to seeing more!
In a DND campaign I'm in rn, I drank some goblins alive, and turned their skin into a bagpipe, then I later upgraded it with kobold bones. Also in that campaign, I suplexed a giant crystal snake, used my beard weapon(I begged a sentient, indestructible flower for brass-knuckles, but got that instead), then I ate a player(after the snake was killed[not by me]), they found a tapeworm thing in my stomach, killed it. Then I got +1 to my constitution save(it's now +9[we're level 8]).
Why was this a cinematic masterpiece?😭 (also why does Paul look like Draco Malfoy)
THE VOX MACHINA AT THE VERY BEGINNING YESYESYEYSGEHSVSJWBSUXUS
mark: ella is that yo-  Fake ella blaaaaaalst attck blaaaaaa
Me neither, I’ve never played this game. My family refuses to play. I want to play though
I haven't played dnd but I have a character and it's a acid dragonborn to
I spit my coffee all over the floor when you said his son ran away when he was 6. Mine didn’t run away until he was 9.
I Just realized that in old oak inn there is a frame of vox machina drinking
Remind me again what happened to the turtle 😢
16:26 **NOT THE JAR!!!!!**
Sick. Shades, dude. 9:32
I want to play DND and I’m always the dungeon master. I always make games for my friends to play and I always make sure they have a as much fun as possible. We recently just finished. Our DND said wonderful at the diecast slave creature on my best friend and I got a 20. And also yes, I am the group leader.
one time me and my party went to a tavern and we had all these adventures and even met some zombies. turns out we were hallucinating the entire time and were drunk. we did this at school :)
If you wanna look into more dnd heavy stuff, might I suggest you get in touch with Dingo Doodles?
This is one of the absolute best dnd plot lines I’ve ever seen 😂❤
I loved that you played d&d my friend Liz showed me last week :] have a good day or night.<3
Bong water 😂 turtle named ✨️bong water✨️
12:40 “so long gay bowser!”
Did anyone notice vox machina
The party I dm for keeps referencing the "Walmart man", so now I have to find out what I'm missing out on
1:15 the legend of vox machina reference
All of my favorite YouTubers are in this viseo 😁
But what happened to the turtle???🙀
I saw a reference to adventure time at 9:50, it is that staring horse.
I have seen all your vids and LOVE them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
So is the game consplay, or is it a game where you make the map and decide what can happen
@jaidenanimations
My character Ai chats be like:
But those riddles were really easy. I couldn't understand half the words the door was saying and I still got them all.
I hope to experience a fever dream like this adventure at least once before my time 😭
Larry from Pokemon refrence
I love how the one line everyone got was laughing and nothing else xD
The blonde weon looks like Larry from pokemon scarlet and purple, he looks the same but in blonde, I love it
14:24 if you pay really close attention after Zute casts the depression command mark Thompsen is playing a really tiny violin with his fingers, i'm verry detail oriented
that was goofy as hell but i loved it.
Is anybody going to point out the horse from adventure time
Why do I seem to be the only one who gets the Mark Thomson reference? 😭   Or maybe the name came up with was coincidental, but I thought it was funny
Alpharad turning into Larry😂
I like this video
NO NOT BIRCH
Poor Mark 😔. First he gets bad rumors spread about him because of a paranoiac. Then he loses his wife and kids. Then he has no friends. Then even after that he keeps getting rumors spread about him. No wonder he was an evil manager. Afterwards in the dungeon, he first becomes depressed then led to believe his wife was back. Before being FUCKING ACID BLASTED POINT BLANK. Finally, he becomes a worm due to the wand and put in a FUCKING JAR.😭 Free my boy Mark
5:12 the new Pokémon Legends game.
you were the person to get my younger sister into d&d
Yooooo my first thought was zebra! I was right for once!
I joined a dnd club but I’m not going to seduce an orc or any creature because they stink and I have morals
Im already subscribed 😊
i just gave my players the option to learn testicular tortion XD
PLEASE post the gameplay or parts of it, we would love it!😊
GROGGGGG
How did I know that that was gonna happen? 15:08
1:15 vow machina reference??
i love how alpha just created larry but blond and with an axe.
I wish my dad would make a fun campaign like this
It’s just a party of animals and Larry 😂
I LOVE DND TOO I LOVE DND wait I just said that
1:25 Dragonborn! *Yelling Dragonborn words*
What’s your class
This was absolutely hilarious. "Don't listem to him he's a zebra" Probably my favourite line 😂😂
That was so wholesome!
I’d love to see her do an animated 40K Crusade.
I love how alpharads character is literally just Larry Pokémon
This is literally like my favorite thing we need more of this content
I never played indeed, but my mother did. She passed 3 days ago so I left a lot of moneyou shouldn't have a film or a storm.
I feel so attacked since my name is mark thompson lmao
This is amazing i wish they would continue like this!!
OMG i just noticed the vox machina party in the tavern!!
That's a hard act to follow!
Vex,keyleth,grog and pike thats all I can recognize 1:13
14:58🤦
Amazing. :)
So alpharad's character is just nonami with an axe?
I too ate clay
GOD MY DAD HASNT SET UP A CAMPAIGN IN FOREVER BUT I just nag him about it every time I get a chance
11:16 and invisible force they cant see - Jayden
I think I love this video too much I rewatched it 12 times already
man what a sweet campaign I hope she does more!
why were the goblins eating the creepy horse from adventure time.
Yeah, Dnd is extremely fun, especially in homebrew campaigns.
I love how you can tell when they rolled low on the dice. Like when alpharad threw the axe boomeranged and hit him in the back
can i join:)
dragon roost island
I NEED MORE!!!!!! WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!?!?
Zoot is special. I love Zoot.
9:11 it's the funny meme!!(this is NOT a 911 joke)
9:51 lol the horse from adventure time, the amount of references in this vid are amazing
1:17 love the vox machina reference 😁
a sheep, mistys cousin, a sound dragon and a pokemon trainer fight IKEAs final boss
THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE WOOOOOOO
Am I the only one who noticed that at the start Paul's tie changes from green to black?
This makes me want to play dnd but I would be scared to meet new people 😃
I always put a point into a Bard Mutli-Class if I'm not playing a Warlock(Due to Pact of the Tome), because I love Vicious Mockery.  1. "A sorcerer?! HA! you can barely cast a shadow!" 2. "Your parents must be Rouges. They used a bonus action to disengage, and the Dash action to run off." 3. "I'M WASTING A SPELL SLOT FOR THIS!?! Do you even have self esteem?" 4. "The only way being a Vampire helps you is now you don't get to see your own face." 5. "You've leveled two kingdoms, razed half a nation to ground, and all before lunch... Not getting anywhere with getting your wife back, buddy-boy."
Vox Machina reference
1:14 vox machina reference
16:52 Did anyone else notice that the a changed
Mate it’s so fun I’ve played and been dm
Oh sorry wait 4 minets i was last on here like when it came out
Is it good
I never played dnd
Man I wish I was creative enough to be able to be a DM…although ive never played dnd
Is there gonna be a series of animations and games
I want to play dnd but my character is a bird (like the ones in angry birds) piloting a human-sized robot suit that can wield firearms
That was amazing, do more
i love this format !!! would be super interested in a second installment 😋😋
That was hilarious, now I really wish to play D&D
Did. Anyone.   See.  The.   Vox.  Machina. At. The.  Start
This video made me realise I’m not subscribed to JaidenAnimation.    So I made the des check and voila. Managed to press that button.
PLS DO MORE I LOVE THIS 😁
I love how Paul's just fed up with like
What's the music playing when Jaiden is talking to the sheep?
This will never not be funny
At 1:00 minute jaiden becomes British for a brief moment “innit”
"Anotha one" is essentially what i got from the ending
That was one of your best video I have ever watch plz make more like theses
1:15 nice ref to vox machina
Please play more, and make fun episodes like this. I need it in my life.
Brewstew is still better
Is hilarious
THIS VIDEO IS AWSOME BTW 15:12
1:26 um this is prob me being a skyrim nerd but arent dragonborn you know human (or whatever race you chose) not actualy like half dragon half man
Moreeeee
If you have more cool dnd sessions like this, you should make a video similar to this one!! This dnd session was really entertaining to listen to and watch!
love the pokemon ranger shadows of almia music for the boss fight
Jaiden Dragón is so adorable❤  0:55
my first dnd session was a couple months back and I also chose dragonborn
why dose corown loks like head crap?
I never played d and d and never heard anyone played it
Alpharad is Larry from Pokemon scarlet
I have a question is it a video game or what is it ?
I feel bad for the boss
This part would always make me laugh 15:27
paul was catching hands left and right 🤣
First time I played dnd I got distracted by a willow wisp and thrown over a wall
Three words just three Dungeons & Dragons
15:30 and proceeds to acid blast
I played a pirate in dnd and rolled a nat 1 to shoot my gun and shot the gunpowder barrel we all died
Played my first game the other day with a sibling DMing my brother and mom and I and it was such chaos I loved it
I play DND and I'm a dragonborn and I have the acid blast as well!
Hello there vox machina
Zuke is a menace
I did not know DandD existed because I only saw it in a cartoon
Do this again forever. Please.
This was fantastic
Hello I was like you Jaiden and still have not played a single game but I trolled in an online game without knowing how to play lol
This was a really entertaining video
so he trew hes 6 year old son
Who else died of laughter when Zoot was like " Then procedes to acid blast him point from the mouth." I straight out died.🤣🤣🤣
Great vox Machina reference
0:25.
Alpharad really looks like Larry from Pokemon and I love it
Session 2 WHEN?
OMG VOX MACHINA< I LOVE THAT SHOW> ITS SO GOOD
''and proceeds to acid blast mark in the face''
"So long gay Bowser!" killed me 😂
I NEED TO SEE MORE OF THIS. This was way too funny.  Also, because of this video I really want to play dnd
Hey
"Me" Yup "Alpharad" Makes sense "And Ranboo" Yo? What's Ranboo doing here? (/pos)
slmccl as dm sounds so completely unhinged yet amazing
I love this Thanks for video is very good
Once i put a bag of holding inside a bag of holding and i lt just spawned infinite bags of holding and broke the economy
THE ENDING IS EPICC
Luap: and was cursed into a sheep's body Me:.... Was mark the one who did it!? I'm so confused, cuz one of them said they were cursed by his neighbor mark!!
dragon born for the win
One campaign I started off in a cage, Presided to get trapped in 5 more cages throughout the whole campaign
Love the Super Star Saga music in the background
DEPRESSION!!
loving embrace: then "proceeds to acid blast him." Edit: I now am officially In a dnd party. As a silver dragonborn, this is still hilarious
My current game, my name is Jungo N.D., Esq., the fattest halfling bard you'll ever find. Had to kill a blood demon, cursed alarm floor that triggers all the enemies in the area, magic wall in front of us that we see through but they can't, standard fare. Couple kobold shamans are trying to cast raise corpse or whatever, so I cast message and tell them we have a bunch of cookies near the wall. Then I cast message again and intimidate one of the shamans so bad he pees his pants, so I immediately cast vicious mockery.
Tholomew is the best character that was created in this game.
and I thought Skyrim was funny
Holwom enfing
was that the Adventure Time derpy horse?
im convinced this is the best video on youtube
DND is a wild yet fun game. I played with friends once and I was a wizard called krayon who was drugged by a old grandma. Then I was addicted to the drugs sooooooo.
I love how, during Masked Dedede's theme in the background, Ranboo's character has a Master Crown moment.
So um i ❤ d&d but my aunt was the dugeon master and we cant play any more cuz we dont visit her that often😢
i js realized the rancat/catboo is a furry-
Awesome
Fun fact my first session of dnd my character (a half elf if i remember correctly) just had a feeling from perception that people were watching us while we were in the woods, so i used a flaming arrow and shot the trees around us, and killed like all 8 or so vigilantes that were definitely going to attack us, everyone was actually really impressed cause as mentioned this was my first run, in fact our groups bard asked me if he could write a song for it, i said sure, and next session he actually came back with a lyrics sheet and his guitar and played us the song, he actually let me keep the paper too, it's still tucked away with my character sheet if i remember correctly
Is Paul meant to be Larry from Scarlet/Violet?
I'm going to need so much more of these
do more d&d plz
I picked up a peircer and dropped it on a ghast
There were a lot of 1s rolled that night.
whats the song name completely at the end of the video also great im seeing this video around 100th time cause i like it and i wanna play d&d
After rewatching Vox machina I ended up going back and looking at some dnd character ideas and I ended up deleting most of what I came up but I was inspired to create a much better character one while improving one of my best ideas. Especially this Goliath barbarian/fighter
Just wow
Wow
It one frame I’m dead 💀 2:24
it would've been wild if Barthalomew woke up the next day and everything had reset
“This is for everything- the low tax return. The retraining order. For moving in next to me! YOU’RE MY PERSONAL HELL!”  -Ranboo ( 16:02 )
The luap plot twist was 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Cats are lactose intolerant 1:18
I need more omg
Convinced they just went into The Unknown with this one. The Beast in the forest, trying to find the perfect fro- turtle name, being transformed into animals.   Coincidence? I think not!
15:27 <- timestamp for myself when i need a laugh :'D
The sheep looks adorable!
One time I played a halfling (don’t know the class) in a three hour game and my party was stuck on a chicken island after barely escaping a prison ship(I failed my roll 5 times and anyone who tried to save me failed but it was the dms first time so I was allowed to live instead of drown…). My character  saw a chicken and immediately picked it up. I would then not put the chicken down for the rest of the game… even during a fight with a dinosaur which went perfectly (I protected my chicken son) we find out there was a curse on the island where everyone turns into a chicken and the bird in holding turns out to be a ten year old boy who was transformed and we are able to speak with him for a moment. We get to the final part (after being told that there’s a wishing thing in the temple of the island) my character happened to have crazy stealth and I was about to set the child down when we realized he wouldn’t let me (like at all…) he trusted me and our bond was the strongest. I sneak through the temple and get past the monster and reach the wishing thing. This is where it really starts going wrong… everyone was yelling directions at me and I accidentally wish to be off of this island… on… another island. Then we all wake up and see the outcome of my horrible mistake. The best part of my wish was that my now human son was no longer cursed. The boy, hugging me, was taller than my short halfling and that was the start of their happy life as father and son. My halfling was named Kevin with a K who doesn’t use pronouns (literally just says names). We were eventually picked up by the other party from a cheese world drag show game where we part and celebrate our freedom by eating cheese.
8:17 can someone. Give me a link to this track that im the backround
My first dnd character was a dwarf bard with a harp as an instrument my group thought it was a funny idea because of how big a harp is and how small a dwarf is
SO 🦆ING COOL AGAIN
When they hugedi was like "and then she killed him" I NEW YOUD DO THAT SOMEHOS
1:16 rewatched this and caught the Vox machina reference😃
4:38 - 7:54  I can not tell you how crazy I went when I heard all the Super Star Saga ost's, I recognized all of them instantly, and I will forever respect you for that!
Y’all should do a part 2 to this story where the wand effects deactivate and Mark is free to cause more chaos
I like the adventure time horse the goblins were cooking
Everything was fine. Until the clay became alive. Then it escelated VERY quickly. Like... HOLY CRAP Jaiden?! Is this what happens when you let your imagination run free?! I don't want to know my adhd imagination would be...
12:36  Paul: I cast ''So long gay bowser''
Man I was dying laughing when Jaden said the guy said I seduced the ogers face
I died to mock 1 speed pee by a dinosaur
In one of my dnd games I smashed the head in of a pregnant zombie (bard)
*Spoilers for the video*  I was cold-calling businesses for a charity event and two times i was defferred to managers, one was called Mark T. and the other was D. Thompson, i think i'm being messed with lmao
NO WHY IS THE HORSE DESGUISE FROM ADVENTURE TIME ROASTING ON A SPIT-
The goblin in the back when the peeler attacks was like “Oh, there he goes again”
could you make another one of these?
9:53 is that the horse from adventure time?
wait you were a dragonborn?
1607 is that seriously all it all it took. Someone got issues
This was by far the best dnd stoy that i have ever heard of
Can you play PvZ garden warfare its a Realy good game
Ok so l have eloped with the BBEG and it was so funny! “ 3 years later you and BBEG are on a cruse, he gets down on one knee and proposes” 😅😂
I played D&D before you were born, before there were video games, in the late 70's, on a PDP 8 mini computer. meh. It was imaginative but without video it didnt make a lot of sense to me. I havent played it since, might be nice to revisit it.
paul looks and acts like larry from pokemon
Jaiden: I cast depression!! ... Mark: I miss my wife, Zuut. I miss her a lot.
Paul easily won MVP in this adventure. Like seriously, saving tholomew (I think that's his name) from the clay crowns possession, communicating  with the goblins, and is just an overall funny character. I'm actually a little sad for him bout his backstory, but yeah. 10/10 for Paul :D
Cool never look at explosions
That first reference.... oh I loved it
Is everyone ignoreing Crit Rolls Campaign 1's characters at a table at 1:16???????
Mark deserved better 😭    You could’ve just sorted out your issues- who am I kidding we all knew this video would be crazy ❤x]
I saw those critical roll references JAIDEN
Out of all of the videos I've seen on this channel... This 1 is definitely confirmed as 1 of my top 3 favorites.
You know rambo
Fun fact Paul was actually a reference to Larry from Pokemon if anyone played Pokemon Scarlet or violet
This is the most sane dnd campaign. Also I love that most adventures start with the party having literally no reason to go along with it yet they do. Even better when they dont even know each other but choose to risk their lives for eachother anyway. In my current campaign we chose to solve the mystery of the village simply because there was a mystery and we were there. It has nothing to do with our personal goals.
Ye olde mart of wall
adventure time horse :OO
I play D&D
come by today and buy some core or we will sacrifice your new born AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
Just wondering could you play more DND? It’s really entertaining seeing what you didn’t DND, so I just wanted to ask
THE BEASTTT 4:15
Your friends has partnered with a ogre, but has he ever courted a dragon and had to pay child support for it?
Yo, Jaiden! Can I maybe use that dnd story as a book that I can write? I happen to be an aspiring author and the story is quite interesting.
i want to try it out, never have.
Whoa! The Vox Machina reference at the beginning was a nice touch lol! Well played
Yall i need to know what's the song at 16:33
when in doubt, scream "DEPRESSION!!!"
I like how jaden just leads us into subscribing 😂
I'm making a dungeons and dragons campaign based off of the anime Jujutsu Kaisen
2:36 When you hear coconut mall start to play, start running.
I noticed an inconsistency, so when Tholemew started talking with Zude & Paul, he called his neighbor Thomas but throughout the rest of the story the neighbor is referred to as Thompson. What the heck, JAIDEN?!
I need MORE
Ok
You should play dnd more often:)
Bagpipe on the cat. Search up Scotland forever it’s beautiful 🎉    Edit: Jaiden: Dragonborn-wizard(?) Cat person who I don’t the name of: Tabaxi-Bard. Jacob: Human-Fighter
Please do more of these!
Who saw the Vox Machina reference
Idk, but that image of Ranboo as that goofy, grinning Tabaxi just feels right
:0
Most of the music are zelda music. Do you like zelda?
Need more
Do it again!!!!!!!!
Aye I’m also doing DND for the first time and I also made my character a Dragonborn but I made mine a Druid also a red one because my first idea was to call him Ridley since he’s my smash main but I charged it to Balasar currently only level one the campaign my group is doing is in the witchlight carnival while I and my group haven’t done much we have all of our things ready for it Balasar’s choice of weapons is two ironwood(I think that’s what it’s called) scimitars (the Egyptian swords) I’m not doing shields because a rule of the Druid class is that you can’t use metal and I’m not using wooden shields I went with dual wielding I’m going for Druid if the moon circle in which at level 10 I will get elemental wildshapes and that is gonna be fun because a thing I have Balasar doing is he doesn’t use his breath weapon because as a Druid he doesn’t want to destroy life basically what Jong Jong the deserter told Team Avatar when he said he wouldn’t train Aang his whole thing about how the other elements work not to mention with circle of the moon other wildshapes become available faster and I can’t wait to do more only problem with our party is we have a thing called murder hobos because not even five minutes into the campaign two party members are trying to either rob or kill the quest giver one of them was an orc and the other unfortunately was a black Dragonborn and everyone has all the good backgrounds and stories on their characters but the one playing the Dragonborn just has them depressed and our DM has them on a chopping block so if they don’t shape up they are getting kicked
15:35 >:0
Why when they said their wife died of child birth, did  think they meant when the wife was born she died
this is so weird because my first dnd experience was this exact campaign and the start went basically the exact same way.
what happened to the time loop
I just wanted to let you know this is such a comfort video for me, I find myself coming back to it a lot :)
I love the Vox Machina easter egg!!!
Once my DnD party tamed a door splinter
this one time at the last moment a magma ball and and ball of light like a sun collide IS SO COOL
Tommyinnit friends
Bro this is just hilarious to watch.
like this comment for part 2 :)
good, fun, good by.
THE FACT THAT PAUL LOOKS LIKE LARRY FROM POKEMON I FUCKING CANT-
I've never wanted to hear anything about D&D BUT GODDAMN, I REGRET IT-
You mean lamb chops I can go for some sheep right now
they cooked ice kings horse outfit 😭
Holy crap this is delightful XD
Jaiden quess what.  I CAST THUNDER SPELL!
Omg i just got the fools gold bit with the giant mecha dragon as the last frame dnd portion frame
There's nothing more realistic than a DnD party not realizing an obvious NPC name clue before the very end.
I spotted references to Vox Machina *AND* Fool's Gold  Nice.
I can't tell what class Paul is, i'm thinking either barbarian or Fighter
emotinal scene jaden: ACID BLAST
HAHA WE LOVE THE VOX MAKINA REFRENCE
I remember when I played this in 1981 you'd have to learn kung-fu to fight bullies that would try to beat you up because you read comics and played D&D or Atari.  Hopefully, those jerks are having daily colonoscopies right now, without lube or mercy, by a gay manticore.
The opening and closing of this session makes it feel like this was based off “a wild sheep chase”.       But only loosely
i'm Dungeon Master and i've so far killed two characters so they had to make new ones
why he date an ogre
4 MONTHS LATER! I ACTUALLY NOTICED THAT FUECOCO IN THE BG AT 4:14
1:16 VOX MACHINA SPOTTED
Honestly who hasn’t played a campaign about a cursed sheep that ended insane at least once
This was super cool! Hoping to see more of those! 🥳
I wonder if they've played more
Omg xD this was hilarius xD awesome xD i play PnP know for years and i never laught so much xD
do dnd  act 2
OMG I'M SO SCARED TAXES?
Luap
What happened to Floyd?
👍👍👍
I was in a campaign once where one character was a robot and had kids with a wall.
Amazing
Can I animate ur vid in the future
*never played it before, soon.. very soon i am*
WOW YOUR SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL I LOVE YOU AND YOUR VIDEOS
I played for the first time last night! It was so much fun!
My brother broke two doors with emotional damage.
17:18  haha so funny
PART 2!!!!! CONTINUE THE STORY PLSSSSS
I have not played that game before
i have alwaseds wanted to play d& d and the way that u did d&d is amazing
In a campaign i am playing with my friends, we are currently enemies with a pirate gang lead by a beholder

TABAXI RANBOOOOO
WOW YOUR SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL I LOVE YOU AND YOUR VIDEOS
This came out the day I was invited to a D&D campaign

Not to long ago i played dnd with my mates and i was the dm
I think I would fit in lol
sequal please we need to know what happens to would-you-love-me-if-i-was-a-worm mark
DDAMD
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN
GROGGGGGGG
This remember me of Adventure Time so much
Anyone else see Vox Machina in the inn at the start lol
This feels like a regular show episode
The vox machina reference 😍
My first dnd character was a witch who had a drinking problem 💀
Ranboos “own personal hell” line at 16:10 was probably so good especially with his acting skills from the DSMP and GenLoss
Love the music selections so much!
Jaiden i had a dream where i wanted to watch your channel so i went to your newest video (it was not this one) i clicked on it and it had a different voice and at the end it said sorry guys jaiden died and i am just here for replacement and then i looked up how did jaiden die (i had tears in my eyes) it showed me a picture of a bunch of things and the way it said you died was there was a bowl at the top of the stairs you walked down and did not see it and fell down the stairs then my grandma called me and i wiped my tears and she had to hang up after 2 minutes then my mom asked why i was so sad i said jaiden died! my mom knew i liked you so she looked it up and saw what i saw and she was like WHAT and that is where my memory stops can you post another video on this channel please i am very very very sad i wanna make sure your ok 😢
THIS WAS SO COOL AND EXTREAM!!!! I ALSO LOVE JAIDENS  ACID BLAST HEHEEH!!!!!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH VOX MACHINA REFERENCE
I played D&D in my characters a dragon born too 😃🍻Let's meet at the tavern
DRAGONBORN LETS GOOO Just started the video, already smiling
THE PLOT TWIST OMG
You should play D&D again and make another video about it
RANBOO?
I've always wanted to play dnd, but I can't find any campaigns near me😭
bro every time he slams on his drums i just think of the dark souls boss music
Inumaki from jjk?
we need more Jaiden Animation D&D Campaigns 🤣
i want to see more of this :D
I came back to rewatch and I am just now noticing Vox Machina
A session i had was with 1 other person we were both bards and drowned 7 giant goblins or trolls 1 being a goblin king to get a boat
I (think) that I played a variation on the same campaign at a recent con — I ended up teleporting the sheep to an unknown plane of reality … accidentally
play more and make more please
Im currently in a dnd class in grade 8 a week in and I’m already having so much fun
Bro I've been making dice for dnd and I've been making money off it I love making the dice
the fact that a dnd party exists with my childhood favorite animation channel, the streamer that i'd watch for hours daily during 2020-2021 lockdowns, the guy who did the improved romeo and juliet performance that i watch at least monthly, and the cohost of my current favorite podcast is a full circle moment that i wasn't expecting. like who would've thought that my favorite creators from such different parts of my life would somehow all be friends with each other
CRITICAL ROLL 1:14
Thalu is kinda hot not gonna lie
5:19 is... is... is that the wet fart sfx
I thought I knew the one-shot when a sheep with a scroll ran into the tavern, but Slime really made it his own! I loved it!
rip marlk
The Art and animation is top notch as always but OMG Ranboo's Tabaxi was soooo adorable I loved him~
Also my first time playing  I rizzed up a spider into joining my team
Ok now I really wanna play dnd

This is golden 😂
Love the vox machina cameo

Every time I hear about someone playing dnd it sounds so fun. I totally wanna try it sometime

what about the turtl
I just realized the invisible force that stoped Zute from going to the golden door was mark's beer gut and he was there but invisible
My d&d story is I gave a dragon 3 different disability’s at level one
I feel like jaiden is based off of inumaki from jjk
15:29 me WAIT HOL IT I JUST HAD A BRUH MOMENT
what
00:30 well, It's kinda...lame. This kind of story is kinda meme.  Just answer me this: - Did ever your group barbarian fight against Hag goons...WITH a Hag? I mean, as a weapon. Barbarian in my group just killed one goon and then ran right to the Hag! Grappled her! And beat the s**t out the other goon. This son of the gun just kept winning grapple rolls. - Same Barbarian. He wanted to intimidate a bandit. Take of his belt...and see to me what "I want to use animal handling"... We laughed a bit and I (with my big stupid mouth) sed "If you roll nat20"... You understand where it goes, right? About half of hour I was like "DM.exe stopped working" while we laughed our lungs off. So...I did the thing what every respectful DM...must do. I say he would pass if he rolls nat20...and...He did roll a nat20. So...the bandit just opened new horizons of his personality. -
"don't listen to him he's a zebra"
Came up with my own D&D pledge of allegiance; Today we are united under the same sun of all the realms in our fair world of   Doing combat and occasionally other people. May we always keep these traditions close and live the adventure of life.
Holyyyy! I've been playing TTRPGs for nearly 30 years now and I wish my first session was this awesome. It seems like you have a good group of people. Hang on to them because groups like these are hard to find.
And the next day it all repeats as they never broke the spell
First thing I noticed was the little CR table at the beginning. Love the nod there.
I would play it Jaiden but I have no friends...
9:12 not the matter baby 😭💀
Paul looks like Larry from pokemon scarlet and violet
10:12 NOT THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE 😭
DEPRESSION
omg its a bynx the cat reference i just got that after a rewatch
Deciding to eat the clay is so overthought. My DND party that I am currently doing right now was brought into a minature version of the town they are in with a minature replica inside that minature version, so my partner decided to SHAKE the board, which released so much magic, it shook the entire town, and now I'm making death saves
Loved this. More of this please ❤
Me and my friends did this campaign and i was the only one that that rolled a check to acc see what it looked like but my dm added an orc and his 3 wolves outside the tavern i feel bad for what happened to him
I love the beast at 4:16 ☺️
XD this is fun i played the same oneshot temples as my first about 1year ago and sins that i am Addicted to playing dnd XD
i love slimccl
as someone who is just getting in to dnd literally as of this moment trying to come up with a character this is not only funny but relatable and makes me look forward to my first campaign
that was awesome. do it again
THE FACT I IMMEDIATELY COULD TELL IT WAS CHARLIE THAT SAID "IT'S WORMIN' TIME" 😭😭
Glad to see your first experience of D&D was as chaotic and fun as it was for me, even chose the same race!  Hope you have many more adventures, my resolution for New Year was to finally start my campaign this year after the years I've been trying to work up to running it with my friends/D&D group.
wtf Jaiden that is messed up
I loved this Ngl, just the style and everything. Well done
I love how Alpha's character is literally just Larry but blonde and not in Pokemon. 10/10
The last dnd session I was in my lvl 2 kenku rouge or a flightless crow man assassin who is also a whereraven so I can turn into a raven or just grow wings I grabbed a goblin and though him in a fire as another more optimistic and idiotic goblin saw and talked to him and here how it went lopped the burning goblin: goblin im burning. Goblin: we are all burning on the inside: lipped no goblin im achulay burning im in so mutch pain. Goblin: im in pain to but dont let it affect your life. At that point in time goblin has been talking to a pile of ash
Me and my friends made a version called doodles and dragons where you sketch out what you want to do, roll, and depending on what you get you draw your position that you wanted to be in or not and the dungeon master is called the doodle master instead
there is a fun game i play called slime rancher that i think you would like.
i feel bad for mark thompson
PLEASE! Someone knows what is the track that start playing in the 16:31 ?
i never played d and d
The calm music in the background
jaden I want you in my party you always have something to joke about
D&D Campaigns be like the SpongeBob "Idiot Box" Episode 😅
This was epic
haha vox machina
It’s not DND or D&D, it’s DAD.
So funny, last Friday I was playing D&D with my friends and one of them sniffed the crow-headed zombie’s feet as I played with its severed arm and my other party members played with a zombie’s dead body as my other friend just watched in horror…. So NoRmAl!
I was playing dnd with some of my classmates and we were having fun and there were these rings that had magical powers combining to they're color i had a pink one so i could talk to animals and other beings like ogres and command them but we had this rule where we would have to train so that we could level it up more and more and then we ended in a dungeon where we had to kill a dragon sort of kill it..... i seduced it and i guess i am an ass now get it 😉 but we had fun but sadly we grew further apart the dnd group and had to quit because of some stuff but hey it was a fun time with them all
ITS SO FUNNY IM DED
The Vox Machina reference at 1:14 was gold
I love the hint to Vox Machina lmao. Almost missed it had to do a double take haha
Help 15:27 😂😂😂😂😂😂
dnd is an amazing game and i put all my xp in to luck (i killed a giant with a literal brick just by getting a lucky shot)
OMG, I just saw Pike, Grog, Keyleith and Vex! Super nice nod to Crit-role there, Jaiden!
loved the Vox Maquina reference
Ranboo was a poor choice to play with, but I guess no one better was available for it.
I need to play this game
i hate this game because i have aphantasia :/ BUT i love watching/listening to other people's game sessions!
4:15 THE BEAST?? 😨
that ending was absolutely beautiful
I kinda hate riddles in D&D, but this is a solid scenario! Beginner or otherwise! Worth stealing!
Now I need to use depression in my dnd campaign
Paul is the goat🐐🐐
I want more plz follow this was great and really makes me want to get into dnd, well I already am but i want to more now
Zoot looks like Susie ftom deltarune
What an epic adventure! Hope to see more!!
Pls tell me that Jaden's charatcher looks like Suzi
Vox machina at the inn nice
Charlie is so goofy what a guy
Doughnut make me subscribe unsubscribe or banana banana
Wait, what was the deal with the cat stuck in a time loop? Wouldn't that mean that the cat has met them thousand times before?
The Sheep was... Ram paging?
paul=Larry from Pokémon
Ok more listening you did
Ok Jaiden please respond but did you use a Metaknight boss battle music from Kirby for the clay fight I do want to know
5:05 “IM A WITTLE DOOR uwu”
I love the references to kids shows! The weird adventure time horse, The Beast from Over the Garden Wall, so iconic and well drawn
If I had a nickel for every cat possessed by an evil crown, I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot but hilarious that it happened twice
4:21 this was DEFINITELY a nat 1 roll
I’d love to play this game as it sounds so fun. I haven’t heard much about it but according to Jaiden you can make whatever you want. If I were a youtuber I’d be a thermal and play with other therians
What happened to Paul Jr
The characters  drinking beer were grog and piky from Vox Mokena on  prime
The sheep's name as a human is "Luap"? Hmmm...
the way you condensed a 9 hour stream into less than 20 minutes LMAO
Anyone else notice the adventure time reference??
I have a weekly rpg session and last time i managed to kill my enemy but, since it was a failed dice, almost drown in their blood then a few hours later while doing archeology i destroyed an antique vase by clumsiness and a bird pooped on me. I threw a dagger at him but failed dice my dagger is now gone...
Gosh, i see the sheep i recognize wild sheep chase.
What happened to turlte dude.
cant get over how smooth these animations are
Paul casually begins "My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
I like the name of the Inn.
Lmao this was fun to watch!
Beatyfull (why do i only find people who want to be little girls?)
I like how alpharad is just larry with a battle axe
Oddly enough, this was the video that made me sub lol
17:07 where is the turtle i think it was gone or i dont rememer
The detail of the vox machina characters drinking was top, keyleth, grog, pike and vex'ahlia
I just realized what happened to paul jr the turtle? Was he the sheep?
Is it just me or this thing glitching with green
I wanna play d&d too😭 but i don't have friends, i have studies as of now or i am not graduating high school😭 i just wanna have fun but my luck is so bad😭 i will have my fun one day yeah🙃
Can we have a "IT'S WORMING TIME!" On a shirt?
I would like to inform you that I also love DnD
IMAGINATION🌈
I forgot how unhinged and chaotic DND parties can get 😂
Alpharad: explains his whole background on character sheet Jaiden: “I’m Zewt…”
This was without a doubt one of the best things I’ve watched ever oh my god :0
BRUV MY CHOSEN NAME IS CHARLIE
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DND
W-why is paul Draco Malfoy?
I need more!!!
i loved this
Picking up the first animal you see and adopting it is the most DnD thing one can do.
I'm the total opposite I love DND but never had anyone to play it with until a couple of days ago
Is it just me or boiler looks like Harry Potter?
I love Paul omg he so epik
THE CHARACTERS LOOK SO EPIK-
W Rizz at 0:24
What’s your fav dnd race? I always am elf sorcerer
OMG I love D&d and I’m going to be Dm
1:15 YOOO VOX MACHINA !
9:52 ADVENTURE TIME HORSE
Hold up… at around 9:50, isn’t that the pony costume from that one episode of adventure time when the ice king is spying on Finn and Jake? I can’t be the only one.
The music choices for this video were absolutely superb!! Really sold the scenes! And the whole adventure was just fun!
"You are my personal hell!" is a great line
It's the dragonborn 😮
fr tho d&d is really fun
I forgot luap existed
0:03  "And you play by using your imagination"  1:38
I'm sorry, please tell me that I'm not the only one who noticed the Kirby and, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I heard Xenoblade Chronicles 2 in there as well
1:10 YOOO VOX MACHINA
I love how when Paul and Tholomew did a team attack you switched to the Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga music that made me snort
I was getting back into my obsessed DM phase a little before this video released. Once it did, I was pretty much in heaven. Or rather, I was in Mount Celestia.
Well in our first session, which was one week ago- the second one was on sunday and was BOMBASTIC- aanyways- in the first one of our comrades (a sorcerer wizard drow) decided it was the best idea to set its overall on fire (bc we just were released out of prison for the adventure) to celebrate his freedom. Our satyr druid LOVED the idea and asked if his could get set on fire too- well they there succesful. Our client (who gave us the mission) runs into the changing room and rants. Getting back out of it he looks at my tiefling barbarian (she stands there and waits, her overrall nicely folded- she is a mother and i guess it´s just something that sticks with her also bc of the way she grew up) and calls her a "Model Inmate". She really didn´t knew if she should be offended or thank him xD
Dnd is my favorite thing, my first playthrough was on a rick and morty one but it was fun, ended up losing the left cheek to a statue but rolling 4 nat 20s in a row was magical
Great video, do more like this
Naruto reference 13:38
9:51 ADVENTURE TIME REFERENCE!
16:08 Jaiden is such a good voice actor what
Yesterday I played it and I became a spider climbed into a ogre and became a human blowing it up from the inside the wiped out half the orc population
1:40 im yoshikage kira, I live in the south part of morioh....(rtc etc)
Oh I once played the start of this campaign! My character did not try to pepper spray the sheep, but to burn it alive for dinner
During my first DND game, I was a chaotic evil barbarian…..with -1 intelligence, the session ended with me trying to seduce a dragon, one of my friend’s who’s bones are pretty much dust at that point is hanging onto said dragon using a sword on dragon’s back
Is that Vox Machina?
cool Vid but a good next game a can be in the sky
i play dnd and im a purple dragon to!!!!!!
I new everything but what class was Jaiden? I can't figure it out someone answer me.
Haminations en español
Cacaaaaa
Ayo what 😅
Dungeons and dragons are probably gonna be one of my future games that I would like to play a lot
I absolutely hated the the talking door
THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE AT 1:15!!!!!
15:28 LOL Did NOT expect that 🤣🤣🤣
Can’t stop thinking about one of the characters looking like sanji.
Dragonborn, excellent Choice i can say so far as a fellow Dragonborn Player as well. In my Headcanon allways a Halfdragon(I like thier Lore more.) Copper Dragons rules!
The very first time I played D&D I also played a Dragonborn 😂 a I'm pretty sure he was a Dragonborn Monk, it was a great time
.
Adventure, Time reference?
Ranboo becomes cat*
That was badass
just realized you and dingo doodles are different people
Cool!
Weaponized depression is an absolute wild concept
I can’t be the only one who thought “depression” was referring to the mental illness right???
I loveeee dungeons and dragons🗿🧌
1:15  HOW DID I NOT NOTICE KIKI, VEX, PIKE, AND GROG THE FIRST 25 TIMES IVE WATCHED THIS?!?
The part where Paul finds his son made me almost shed a tear, BRAVO!
Potential vid spoiler*  If the quest was to turn the sheep back into a person couldn’t they just ask the door to do it since they turned the dude into a zebra?
MAKE MORE OF THIIIIIIIIIIIS!
Love the "Over the Garden Wall" reference at 4:15... beware the beast. Also, the Paul Jr names were excellent!
Uuuuh the name mark is my name
The best part is that Paul yeeted his own son in sheep form twice.
Why does one character remind me of Larry from Pokémon
Man I always wanted to do a D&D session, one of my siblings kind of asked if I want to do a session with a few of his friends and I said sure but some things came up and we never really did.
Jaiden, I just gotta say, you would make a GREAT author. Your vocabulary and description and just all that leaves me in AWE ✨for example, 1:00 - 1:29
It's so crazy how many ways I've seen people run this one shot
I love jadens profile picture
Was this streamed? If so where can I find it
Vox MACHINA
no lie, this video finally kickstarted me into getting into d&d. 3 months in and I haven't looked back
I hate riddles in D&D games.  The riddles should be for the characters, not the players.  So, the actual content of the riddle shouldn't matter, the characters should have a chance to use their lore, knowledge, wisdom, or intelligence.  There is no reason why I can't have a character that knows more or less than I do.
The ogre thing was better than when my Priest fell in love with a girl who then got killed by the bbeg and then my priest got led down a path where he got corrupted slowly turned into a nosferatu and was trapped in Ravenloft... fun times.
Oh wow I was quite invested, thanks for sharing.
Ranboo and Charlie’s laughs are priceless <3
this was soooo awesome  I wish i had friends to play d and d with
What about the cat being in a time loop?
Y E E T
I LOVE D&D
Around January 12-16 me and my friends made a game called "Caves & Birds" or CnB just a ripoff of dnd basically we got really into it and one of my friends printed out maps and we made are own characters we put our hard work into it!❤
whats the song at 15:12?
this amazing like all of her video,s
in my DND game i was a dragonkin and i rizzed up a dragon that fell out of a tree-
Deltarune
I have played dnd before and still playing
9:50 rip ice king
Does anyone know the ending song?
Omfg is alpharade character a refrence to larry from pokemon if so based
Love the vox machina shout out in the animation at the very beginning!
2:47 when the coconut mall kicks in
I unsubbed.
That was an awesome one shot
The fact that he yeeted his son is honestly awesome.
where does paul work a walmart?
ALPHARAD BEING LARRY FROM POKÉMON SV IS INCREDIBLE 😭
i only played once
I’m sorry I saw vox machina in that tavern
can you play deltarune :D
thats... thats not how the command spells works...
3 months later i noticed that "paul" looks like that one normal (hot) gym leader
Bro I'm in a club of dungeons and dragons 😮😮
Today was my first time playing D&D I like it so far
I love how you can tell exactly when the 1’s and 20’s were rolled
Ayyyyyy Vox Machina reference
I always thought D&D was fun but I’ve never had great luck with groups.  The first group I got with never explained the game, how to play it, what their campaign rules were, etc. and constantly complained that I wasn’t a real life mind-reader, they judged my character, changed it themselves without consulting me & bullied me with it, then they complained about how I used anything, wouldn’t respect me when I refused alcoholic drinks (these people started off light but ended up finishing multiple vodka bottles a night) and were super strict for no reason, then they’d complain that their group never grew beyond their 4 childhood friends when I’d seen at least 8 people join their group and either leave or get kicked for no reason.   The second group became anti-human characters & the DM actively sabotaged people in what was supposed to be nice campaigns (we had designated evil campaigns for other characters & nice campaigns for characters we were attached to & we were trying to keep it respectful for consent reasons) the DM even used an inappropriate topic that was legally a crime to set off someone’s irl ptsd, deliberately to target them for showing up 2 minutes late to a session.  The third group was good, and I knew the rules, but then a few people dated & broke up breaking the group up.   Then the respectful people left D&D so we can’t really play it anymore.. kinda sucks I don’t have anyone to play with.
I like dnd :)
My friends love dnd and ive been dragged into it and i don’t regret it lmao
what class was Paul? Tholemew is a tabaxi bard, Zoot is a dragonborn warlock, and Paul is a human….?
Absolute fire ending
I too have been in my first campaign since June.  It has been incredible and helpful during my cancer treatment.  I play an aaraoka bard.  I'll be stepping out for surgery and my character might be captured during that time by the enemy we are currently fighting.  If so I hope my character gets a Zazu moment to irritate the villains.  Whether it happens or not it happens, the idea amuses me nonetheless.
Where can i watch the letsplay??
I've always wanted to play DnD! It's so interesting and amazing and then I remember that its 40$+ in my country (just for the starter set) and it's rarely ever available...
Sprich deutsch du ...
So zewt got the cursed speech ability?
Rooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!
amazing video Jaiden
Hey Larian! If you need BG3 dlc ideas... *gestures*
THE LEGEND OF VOX MACHINAAAA
Why is no one else realizing that's just Larry
Hell yah for the Vox Machina reference!
i love how the most replayed is the part where she blasts the dude in the face with acid blast
One of my favorite experiences was about a goat named Gertrude..  So my party and I were fighting some cursed scarecrows for a town outside of our city. We were using a goat as bait for the scarecrows and after, I decided it would be a great idea to feed this dark magical hay to this goat. Then she developed a psychic scream along with bright red pupils. It was amazing and she became my familiar and she would fight in battles with us. HOWEVER- last session it was discovered by our newest party member, Remus, that Gertrude was in fact possessed by a demon. Apparently, I opened a portal to the underworld of sorts and when I fed Gertrude the cursed hay. It came through and possessed my beloved goat. ALSO- apparently I UNKNOWINGLY signed a contract, the contents I do not know- but if I die before the contract is up he will take my soul and I will forever amuse him in the underworld. However- another plot twist. My in-game character, Faelyn, knows none of this because the demon inside Gertrude threatened Remus if he told anyone. So only Remus, the newest member, knows that my beloved goat is actually a demon who I signed some sort of contract with.   THEN we stumble across a seerer who tells me BEWARE THE DARK ONE and ONLY YOU CAN SAVE THEM. Then he promptly passed out and we put him in an invisible cage until we were done with what we were doing..  That was our last session and now I will not no more until sometime next month. 😭  Update- her mouth is now an abyss and she drains life from those she bites… also she died…  But we did a dark ritual with an itty bitty human sacrifice so she’s back 🙃
I PlayDand D
WAS THAT VOX MACHINA FYVFUCRSRYGCUH
I'm up for season two:)
can someone tell me how to play d&d? it looks fun
Eyyyyy, what a fun story
Wait this was an awesome story permission to steal some things from it for my next story
I once died in d&d because I ate a fistful of dirt
Wait was the horse based off the horse from adventure time 😂😂
those are very VERY cool characters depressed business man cat bard turning more and more insane because bards don't gain much money and a wizaard dragon
I love how there's Vox Machina in the animation.
Can Freddy Fazbear do my taxes?
I SEE THE VOX MACHINA GUYS IN THE BEGINNING long live grog and pike drinking the ale (and Key and Vex ❤)
Can’t believe this whole time I wasn’t subscribed. Thanks for the reminder 😊
you get a 20 on your spot check. you see 93 gold dragons flying towards you! they all blast you with fire. you take 8923 damage and 260 rounds of burning at 122 damage per round. you have been completely demolecularized! neither your atoms, your soul, or the phisical space that confined you exist anymore.
I noticed the vox machina! Awesome show and nice animation as always.
did you know paul looks like larry from pokemon
why does alpharad remind me of Larry from Pokémon S/V
Bro you are such a jerk you doxxed one of your fans
I really love your videos❤
I saw the beast, over the garden wall
First time i played dnd i woke up in a battle field
Why did I cry at the Paul and Ella/Zoot scene 😭😭
Lmao “BONG WATER”
'Luap' becomes 'Paul' -- OOOOOHHHHHH!  I seriously laughed out loud!  That was fantastic!
Larry the gym leader, Bongo Cat, and a lizard beat up local manager. More at 11
Your door
I think that Paul read jjk before this, bc when I saw Paul, I immediately thought Higuruma😂😂
This is the best video I ever saw so far
I love that vox machina is just there
I do wish she had added the "I'm the devil Zoot, you can't la-la-la me", but this is so beautifully chaotic and unhinged
Finally, someone told me their d&d story in an interesting and engaging way
WHY THY’N F*CK DID YOU TRY TO SPRAY ME WITH MACE
I want part two
Just solving a sculpting puzzle la la la- ITS WORMIN' TIME
very col
I really love how you draw Slimecicle. You're an absolutely incredible person, keep being yourself!
THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE IMMEDIATELY
I haven't actually played DnD but this video make me want to play it
I completely derailed my first campaign by robbing a bank and then ended up gaslighting the judge with a nat20 to get out scott free.
That was so goood
ah dnd how i love that game.. milena (i) and friends are going to port banister to give a wizard some kind of book  the travelers have been walking for hours and its getting dark so we go to sleep... milena wakes up because of a loud noise she decides to go look what made the noise. BOOM a mud monster comes from the ground and hits milena on the FACE  her friend liza comes look for me and sees me laying on the ground with blood all over milenas face! liza starts healing me and all the boys (rob george and owen) come fast to see what is going on. everyone starts attacing the muddy monster! the monster is dead and its morning the travelers have walked for 3 days and are at port bannister we give the wizard his book and go to a bar to uhh.. drink... yeah and find a job to get money ofcourse everyone say yes and the story has begun... the travelers are going to. uhh.. i cant remember and we get 10 gold per fight we see 3 goblins and kill them 10+ gold and after some days we see a wyvern trying to kill someone and this is a funny part so i milena threw a magic rock at the wyvern and the firey bird thinks that george threw the rock so the wyvern takes george and flyes to the sky... (fun fact im a druid and cernunnos is my god) so owen does a toxic rain at the wyvern and the rain goes to.. well george ofcourse and then the wyvern lets go and george falls to the ground with bruises all over him and a poisoned arm so milena as a druid makes a healing potion and george is okay so i almost killed but saved by friends life. 10+ gold. so the travelers go back home (redwick) and milena has bought a horse and rob has bought a donkey and well rob and george eat the donkey..and my god is cernunnos and the eat the donkey AND MY GOD IS CER- so uhh travelers are gonna go defeat a witch that has kidnapped liza when she was 5 now she is 16 and we have not done anything after that (MY HAND AND FINGERS HURT OF TYPING THAT PLZ ANSWER)
I loved this❤
WHATS THE NAME OF THE LAST SONG PLEASE
i loved that SO much! it was super cool!
it was funny and great and jaiden is awesome
womp womp
10:51 I'd know that horse anywhere
I love this! You should make this a series!
Bro looks like Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet
I just realized this, the invisible force is probably Mark/Thompson (For specification, click/tap on this comment; I've said more about this there)
How did I know that that luap was paul?!!?!?
I love the small detail of a Displace Beast's head on the wall of the inn. Please play more D&D
Three months later, and I have decided to run this exact one shot for a group of friends. I just hope it goes as well as this absolutely maniacally hilarious story.
10:51 adventure time meme
“DEPRESSION” HELP??
I am cry-laughing oh my god.
I don't think I've ever heard of Comand Word being used that way before
If this video had casting  Perfect VA for Mark Thompson is Jschlat Riddle Door: Keith David Goblins: Quackity
1:46 ...why is Jacob's character so depressed?
Ranboo cat was adorable☺
love the critical reference in the beginning at the tavern <33
A yo can I join one of these if yall play online?
I like the vox machina reference at the beginning.
Have you heard of the all mighty one Gnarpy
One time i ran into an elf playing with my brothers thinking he wanted to fight me and nope he just wanted to hage a drinking contest i drank 9 bottles of beer that night
Im going to start my first session of dnd soon and Im using this for reference as to what to somewhat expect.
I thought Dungeons and Dragons was a customizable board game. I didn't realize you could literally make stuff up.
PAUL DESERVED BETTER!
Pt. 2
I literally just started playing lol
This was so much fun oh my god!!! Amazing :D
The fucking walmart vest kills me XD
This was such an awesome video to watch, especially animated. 10/10
As soon as the sheep busted into the inn, I knew exactly which module this was! It is so fun seeing how it was modified
I saw Key'Leth there.
A VOX MACHINA REFERENCE???
"So Paul 'So long gay Browser's' the sheep" had me choking on my water 😂
one of them was just larry from pokemon gen 9
Having your spell focus tattooed on your tongue is such a cool idea, I think I'm going to steal that.
lmao the creepy sheep or whatever that is from adventure time got cooked
Ima name my dog Bong Water
Ye ole mart of wal is classic af lmao
what about the time loop????
Should I Kill Count this?
im so glad i was able to get almost every reference
ooh sounds so fun i hope you had fun and dnd is my favorite!
The Vox Machina reference is God teir
Holy shit! It's Susie from Deltarune!
As Gojo, my charisma stat is at 50
PLAY IT AGAIN PLEASE 😫😫😫☹️😭🥹✨✨❤️‍🩹
The critical role cameos!!!!
4:13 fuecoco
0.57 she is Susie from Deltarune
THE CRITICAL ROLL REFERENCE!!!!!!
Yes nerds unit
WE NEED MOREEEEEE
Hey Jaiden, I just wanna say that can u say hi to Ari and Tofu for me
I love this colab (Idk If this is what you colab) THIS SI AMAZING
I ABSOLUTELY need more of these videos!
I like how Paul’s  hairstyle sorta resembles Larry’s from scarlet and violet. The story is crazy though.
Don’t know if you play video games but u should play sea of thieves. You’ll have similar adventures to this
You draw furries too well
I love watching this every day when I want to genuinely laugh. One question though, what happens to the turtle? I liked the turtle so I can’t help but be concerned
I liked it, made me wanna try dungeons and dragons
everytime I invite a new player into a campaign they always choose dragonborn but cant blame em "dragonborn?" that shit sounds so cool
I saw the vox machina characters... :)
“ITS WORMIN TIME” -worm clayton
The only issue with DnD is the ratio of players to DM's is out of whack with too many players.
you just didn't use "command" with "depression" as word HAHAHAHAHAHA
... THAT WAS HYPE also these characters i love em so much especially the dragon jaiden made
Vox machinaaaa
I need to try a DnD session again more than ever.
Is Paul just Larry from Pokémon scarlet violet
vox machina is just there!!
I remember my first time playing D&D. I played as an Ogre Warlock, (running off of Goliath rules for the race) who was a Chef that.. Well, let's say he's so incompetent at cooking, that it somehow made Gordon Ramsay himself omniscient, and uses his ire to fuel his spells. I then went on to manage to pocket an entire dead horse into a satchel, widen a small crack in the wall by just attempting to squeeze through it, and apparently, climb in through a goblin's toilet, into the boss room, circumventing the entire dungeon that was intended for us to slog through, and proceed to not only terrify everything in the room, but give two goblins food poisoning so hard, they died.  God, I miss that group. This game is wild when the DM is able to handle the sheer chaos. But it's equally as capable of creating such fantastic and compelling stories. It's fun to just turn your session into a hodgepodge of whatever you feel like, but when you get into the roleplaying aspect, look to make it one hell of a story, it's just the best.  ...Although I have to say, playing your characters with cartoon physics is also pretty funny, and you should try it with a DM that's willing and able to put up with that crap at least once.
I was waiting for something to happen when you hugged him. There’s no such thing as a happy ending in DND just dice and depression
2:48 10/10 sheep pun
Love how vox machima was at the tavern too nice detail
Paul was Larry from pokemon change my mind
Ok now i know ever youtuber are NOT family friendly😅
“ITS WORMIN TIME” is the best line in all dnd
The Vox Machina reference in the beginning had my friends and I cracking up!! I love that little hidden reference lol!! It always starts in a Tavern!
the sub trick worked [i subbed]
When I first saw this I never expected that acid blast from the mouth after a super wholesome moment 😂😂
Im glad one of my fav YouTuber is playing D&D
I really wanna know what that sigil / Glyph on Dragonborn Jaidens tongue is.
This was super nice :)
Who else noticed the horse that the goblins were cooking was the same horse from that Adventure Time episode 😂
I love that alpha rad just basically was Larry
Wheres the dnd vid with the monkeyboy😢
Them casually turning into an entirely furry party. 😂
First time playing and I kidnapped a goblin and seduced two guards at the entrance to the town. We had just started
This is why we don’t take DND seriously
More dnd please!!!!!!!
I like that the character archetypes they went with are: "Depressed single father with no purpose in life" "Paranoid schizophrenic who thinks he's in a time loop" "Psychopath"
what did he mean the reastaing order
“YOUR MY PERSONAL HELL!!” *proceeds to zap him* this had me dying…
The world's smallest violin got me dieing laughing
I swear this feels like a one shot and if it is why do one shots like start with you in a pub and an animal holding a scroll that gives you the ability to talk to animals and then at the end turns back into a loved one
Favorite dnd story to share. One of the players was a necromancer that was able to make bones explode. I don't remember how. We were thousands of feet underground under a mountain. He decided he would have the necromancer throw what he called "a bag of rat bone grenades" at the bad guy. HE MISSED AND HIT THE CAVE WALL WHICH CAUSED EVERYONE TO FRICKEN DIE. He did a TPK by throwing a bag of rat bones he made into grenades.
FURRY BAIT!!!
one word:wow
PLEASEEE I NEED MORREEEE
I screamed seeing vox machina as background characters 😭😭
2:25 . THAT FACE OF PURE DISBELIEF . i love it HAHAHAHAHAHA
1:40 I get Larry vibes from him
This is my favourite animation story in my whole life..😂😂I was really very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😹😹😹😹😹😹
Anime?...brwfff...manhwa?..brwfff, phak dat s***....this s*** is fire!🔥🔥
8:22 ITS WORMING TIME
The clay puzzle is brilliant.
This makes me wanna play dnd
I hope the riddle door didn't have that voice at the actual table, because I couldn't understand a zist of what it was saying.
Jaiden's unfamiliarity with mace...
Moreee
Jaiden: One of them stand out... a cat with verious instruments siting at a table. Leaning over their cup of milk, they spot a dragonborn- Me: Dovahkiin, Dovahkiin naal ok zin los vahriin wah dein vokul mahfaeraak ahst vaal! (Yes Elder scrolls V: skyrim refrence)
that was amazing
I loved it when the worm says "it's worming time" and worms everywhere
Power word depression is OP. Needs nerf.
I love Paul.
12:25  Even in death, The Peeler keeps peeling
Was that the critical role vox in the beginning
Brah..it's only now that I understand that the people in the tavern were the vox machina party!
DEPRESSION 🤑🤑
I really would enjoy a dnd play through on your channel
sooooooooo awesome omg :D
my reaction after the video ._.
Play ordem paranormal Cellbit RPG
Not the Draco malfoy but I would be the cat
First video I saw you. Thake the Subscribe
when part 2?
Vox Machina in the beginning. love it
You have a VERY creative D&D master 😂
12:37 “… so Paul ‘so long, eh bowser’s the sheep into the air.”
I was watching this vid on x2 speed for some reason which made the “proceed to acid blast him point blank” like 23x funnier
Jacob’s character looks like Larry form scarlet and violet
stranger things???? 😂
Poggers
I cannot wait to play Dnd for the first time
POV: You have a bard in your party 0:23
I like how Paul is just blond Larry
“Acid blast him, point-blank, from the mouth!”
This looks so fun I want to play it :(
this was mad and great... but mad xD
This was pretty boring
9:01
Casting depression on someone is the most evil thing ever
My first D&D game started in a retirement home
Just started, and I already love that Paul (I'm going to guess is Alpharad's character) is just Larry from Pokemon Scarlet/Violet except sadder.
Jaiden committed SO many war crimes 😭
did anybody else notice vox machina in the tavern
The Tarasque💀(I can’t spell his name)
There was one time I got healed to death on my campaign
awesome video you should do more of these
I love the animation of the eyes so much.😂  Hilarious video overall double subbed.
anyone else realize alpharad modeled his character after larry?
we should know by now not to give slimcicle the powers of god or bad things are gonna happen
4:37 I SEDUCE THE DOOR!!
i really want to play but my work schedule and more importantly the fact that i have no friends prevents it
Love how Paul's design references Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
some how its funny when the door when't "wroooong!".😂
16:48
I had an argument with a lizard person about negotiation, because he did the opposite  D&D sure is fun (but fr it is)
My favorite part was when the worm said it’s worming time and wormed all over the place
i just found out, like, how closely jaiden's dnd character and susie from deltarune look is just uncanny
It looks like the trio are based on Soldier, Poet and King. Soldier being Paul (Alpharad) because of the axe. Poet being Zewt (Jaiden) because of her using her words to distract their enemies. And king being Tholomew (Ranboo) because of him making a crown out of clay.
That was a WILD RIDE, and I loved every second of it! Paul was surprisingly compelling.
Do an other one please
YOU PLAYED DND WITH RANBOO❤❤ that is literally my dream
So there’s a pt 2 right ❤😂
tbh i strongly expected a suplex instead of an acid blast but this works
12:48 mark cameo
SEDUCE SEDUCE SEDUCE SEDUCE
Also "how do you wanna do this" also CRITICAL RIOOOOOOOLE
What was the song that played at the end?
I love that this was Jaiden's first ever DND session and yet she pulled off the most pro-gamer move ever with the whole "DEPRESSION!" Command spell followed by the disguise self spell as the depressed enemy's estranged wife. Brilliantly done!
Wait what about the cats time loop- is he still stuck?
One time when my brother and I were playing D&D with friends, my brother's character got spotted by an enemy grunt. Before any combat could take place, my brother rolled to tell the grunt "I am a figment of your imagination." And it actually worked.
I didn’t want to say anything at first but it’s too funny not to once you realize. Dragonborn don’t have tails Jaiden, you were playing a black half-dragon. Funny because black dragons are usually the most insane and evil of the bunch.
Super cringe
Loved that
Y ahora solo quiero jugar ajjshjda se ve súper divertido
I saw a slime boi and thought slimecicle and I was right
9:52 is that an adventure time refrence
Wait Ramboo as in the Minecraft youtuber?
Dang.. now I wanna play dungeons and dragons
so obviously I've played dnd, and my character cannot fight to save their life... but when it comes to stealth attacking to snap a childs neck... i get a nat 20... outside of that, i keep getting lower than 10s
This is, without a doubt, the MOST UNHINGED thing I have ever witnessed.   MOAR
That was honestly so cool😭😭😭
I chose dragonborn on my first time too!
Hey jaiden I know this isn’t relavent to the vid but I love ur vids and another streamer/youtuber called pointcrow and I would love to see you collab but his content is a bit different. I love your vids and if you see this can I be in a vid thanks!
do this again please!!!
DEPRESSION 🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥‼️🔥‼️🔥‼️‼️🔥🔥
DO A PT2
9:51 adventure time reference
i dont think its fun so should i unsub?jk
I laughed so hard at this omfg… I love dnd it’s a really nice game
I killed all the monsters:)
Bro mark did NOT deserve this 💀
vox machina
Cant believe the Chulk was the dungeon master.
Pual was a bada** and also Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet😆
Does anyone know what music is playing in 8:00?
1:14 nice Vox Machina reference 😂
I demand more
Jaden's dragon character design gives me Susie from deltarune vibes.
Also you should give some ones character to have the abilities to break the fourth wall and speak to the dm
Did you know that some schools have dnd clubs like my school and my brothers school and we are both in a DND club my DND teacher that supervised the campaigns going on said last year there was only 12 people in DND club after school this year there's 54
I need more
I actually had a group of DND but a friend went on a mental breakdown and broke something that broke up the group I was a Dragonborn Named Ripper
No joke, I would watch the heck out of this show
This is what every player wishes someone in their party could do:  literally reanimate the events of the session.  This was so cool
So Collor Spray is mace in DnD world ? XD
One day I want to play with these guys
I want to eat the sheep.
I just love the penguin Paul builds out of clay🐧
That’s Larry from Pokemon scarlet and violet
I played it I hate it but it's not the game fault it was the...game masters?...fault for taking a joke to literal
.
The working together😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Always wanted to play dungeons and dragons but can’t find anyone else
This looks like a very familiar oneshot. I feel like there was a bed dragon in my version. It was more based off the original oneshot, without any real modifications.  Ah, I remember that I negged the polymorphed wizard in this campaign. Eventually, my character cast enemkes abound and that party just camped behind a pillar until the wizard was the only one left. Murdered him, and then the wizard dies and our sheep was unpolymorphed. My character continue negging him and the polymorph wand snapped, leaving the sad wizard to be depressed as we left.
Alfarads character looks like larry from scarlet and violet
VOX MACHINA REFERENCE, HELL YEAH!
11:39 you missed the only opportunity to put the Kirby Scream meme sound in...
This is so Awesome!!!
Mr. Come down today and try some corn or we will sacrifice your newborn. *AAAAAA-* Edit: is Paul a Blonde Larry from Pokemon?
Thank you jaiden for the lizarb representation   Also the conversation about Mark is so funny. 5 lines of exposition   “Do you know Mark?” “.... no???”
Hey, if you want more chaos (Most likely as a Dragonborn), just contact me.     -Another AroAce D&D nerd who plays Dragonborn a lot.
Love how its just never acknowledged that they threw pauls son at a wall. TWICE
What happened to turtle Paul junior?
Me and My friends were playing and we ended up seducing 3dragons
I desperately need a vod of this campaign happening
I love how on Jaiden’s first time with D&D her and the party pretty much act like most parties I’ve seen
Does anyone know if there was a vod of them playing dungeons and dragons? If so can someone send me the link?
Paul looks like Larry from Pokémon violet
Was Charlie on drugs? That was an entire season of random events
I just wanna play dnd but im 12 and broke :_). Lol
OMAGA THIS IS SO INTERESTING, im not usually like to watch animations like I use to skip and skip but I watched this till the end, great job jaiden!
That mean he trow his kid 16:53
Мне реально плохо из за того что я русский и не разговариваю по английски а канал с переводами роликов Джейден удалили
Paul is a mood.
I love the vox Machina reference
In my dnd Champaign I made fun of a dwarf and ran away💀
As a DM, the smash cut to everyone laughing their ass off is so real
7:03 PLEASE WHAT IS THIS SONG IT HAS BEEN STUCK IN MY HEAD FOR YEARS AND I CAN'T FIND IT
Let Jan join next time
Anybody notice the adventure time reference?
The sudden acid breath to the face had my dying just as bad as everyone else XD
The acid blast must have been a nat 20
Ew
CAT RANBOO AND DRAGON JAIDEN ❤
Paul = normal type gym leader larry 100%
i love dnd
DMs are not gods. THE GODS BOW TO THEIR EVERY WHIM!!!
I played dnd before and i killed a  big ogre and ate its balls   it is considered as a delicacy
Am I the only one who didn’t know it was them until way later
Eild walt of mar😂 bruh its walmart UHHHHH 2:49
Poor mark
my family still like holding over my head the time I just charm monster and charmed the dragon boss as my friend at level two
If I Ever Hear Dungeons And Dragons Or D&D My Mind Would Go Straight To The Party Crashers And Noah
Alpha is just blonde Larry 😂😂😂
MART OF WAL???? WHERE IS IT
I don't know why, but that purple tongue with the rune on it is cute in some kind of way.  Also laughed so hard when you acid blasted him in the face.
Can I steal zoot
I like how Jacob literally just made Larry from pokemon. He did change the backstory a bit but come on. We all saw how much he loved Larry. He made Larry.
Absolute madness. Love it
VOX MACHINA FUCK SHIT UP!!!!
Will you do more dnd? I really think it would be unique if you made your dnd character a slime or a harpy.
did they get out of the time loop tho :o
MORE!!!!!!!
Did the goblins kill the purple horse from adventure time
I need another dnd animation with jaiden
I.  Really.  Like.  And.    Do.  You😮😊
"D E P R E S S I O N"
Plz in part 2 a Zuke head buts a blue dragon born because well funny 🎉
I love this game
I have heard so much about D&D from tv shows and movies…..I grew up in a rough environment so most of my friends find this game lame and nerdy…..recently I have been intrigued and been researching alot but somehow I havent been able to get myself to play bc no one around me will take it seriously…does anybody have any advice on how to get over this block? Thanks 🙏🏽
I love DND teehee
Now play Warhammer
“Born and raised!” “I wish I was.”
As your average 10 foot tall -5 intelligence 25 strength ork that loves ice cream I have amazing stories
Apparently nat 20 + translate animal spell = massive shockwave 3:16
Seems like first session was great success:) Such a great animation, it was so fun to watch. Also, Critical roll cameo very cite:)
This makes me feel like I'm the chaotic one of our group. Most of the comedic moments trace back to my character messing up or doing random shit while also carrying utter hatred for every human being. I'm the most useless one, but I'm also the comedic relief lol
luap to paul
luap
luwap pawul
We need more of this  I loved this video and can’t wait to see if you make more content like this
Jacob looks like Larry from pokemon
Hi
You ain't a true bard until you seduce your way out of at least 20 encounters that would normally end in combat. (Completely unrelated to the video but I wanted to say it and you can't stop me)
DUUUUUUDE I WANT TO PLAY THIS SO BAAAAAD
Ahhhh the over the garden wall reference with the turtle names!!!
PART 2 PLS
This makes me want to get into playing Dnd
Please make more! I loved this so much. Haha
The music in this video was great. 10/10
Paul Jr. Doesn't deserve to be thrown at a door. Throw him at enemies.
I love the little T on the crown that ramboo made
Pt 2
WE. NEED. A. SPEQAL.
this was the most nerdiest geekiest video ive watched and i enjoyed it
Paul really be that dilf with a tragic past……
If I saw correctly, I love the Vox Machina cameo
you play fortnite
One time me and my friends killed a poor leviathan and his family while he was drinking tea
WHAT'S THE MUSIC AAAAAHG
As a DND rookie this was awesome
MORE
In the background when Jaiden sees animals one of them are fuecoco from scarlet and violet
I LOVE D&D me nd my guy friends play every weekend. although ONE OF THEM HAD TO KILL MY OC FOR NO REASON
That Critical Role easter egg tho...
Love the critical role reference
4:15 The Beast!?

This with out question is your best video yet keep up the good work and pls make more like this
I would really like to play DND I have never really played it. But none of my friends like it;(
My 3yr old kid loves this, and I love the Riddle Door.
14:05  HOW HAVE I NEVER HEARD OF SOMEONE USING COMMAND: DEPRESSION BEFORE?!  Anyway, this video is some of the funniest shit I’ve ever watched. Absolute masterpiece.
4:23 had me ROLLING!

i wanna play DnD once too!!! i asked some friends to play, they said "cool, yeah lets play" its been month since we agreed to play... we still didn't play ONCE!!!
Try one piece dnd
More
1:15 casual Vox Machina^^ Nice
Is nobody gonna talk about how the clay crown turns into headcrab
Dear Jaiden, you have created another amazing animation and it's a true masterpiece. By the way, what was the name of the music that you used at the end of the video.
Best game
15:18 😂😂😂😂
Last time I played dnd my friend killed me and turned me into a human puppet
i want paul
That music when their beating mark is the forgo dedede boss song

I'd love to see more of these
How I hate 5th edition
epicc the dnd capaign i'm apart of  can't decide when we're gonna do the next session I would love to join you guys sometime I'm an aspiring youtuber/twitch streamer also sounds like y'all had a lot of fun : ]
40.
I remember my first time playing dnd when I summoned a microwave and left honeybuns in it for 45 minutes then catapulted them at a dragon
THAT WAS SO COOL !!!!
I kinda wanna play D&D
Do you mean no wand can 15:46
i love these videos
2 minutes in and I’M FREAKING LOVING THIS!
I think that it is really funny that you have a tabaxi and a Dragon born because those are the two things that me an my best friend first played.
Love the "ITS WORMING TIME" 😂
I loved this I will 100% watch you guys play dnd
Jacob's character looks like Larry, the normal type gym leader from Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, XD
we have this one person in our campain keeps seducing everyone. like we found the villain and boom he got seduced.
1:16 VOX MACHINAAAAAAAAA I love them 💜
One time my brother threw dirt at a water weird •.•
This was perfect! I need a sequel 😂💜
Is it just me or does Paul look like Larry from Pokémon
Paul deserves a promotion
Hello Jaiden, I make animations too! Could I work on your team to help make some animations for you? 😁
Can’t believe you didn’t include how Paul and Paul Jr. created Target at the end
OH MY GOD ITS LARRYYYYYYYY
Mart of Wal, gotta love it.
Now that's what we call a good story, nice animation, and cool characters. Jaiden's character seems very interesting.  Good job you 4👍
This was amazing
i love playing dnd
You should make more videos based off of you’re dungeons and dragons sessions, great video!
The fact she wasn't a blue aarakocra Barbarian is a crime
Was the T Crown for Ranboo's character an ode to Techno?
I love that alpharad is a depresed middle madigmint person that is done with life
Hahahahaha I never thought of using depression as a command
Dear God I feel like you would be one of the best people to play dnd with
The fact that slime was the host just makes it better
I keep thinking lwap is Le WAP *starts singing WAP in a french accent*
40k is way better
D&D: where chaos reigns and the motto of "what could possibly go wrong?" is shared by  the player hivemind
How strong is the manager to handle a point blank acid blast. Wow
AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
In the first old oak Inn scene, there's a table with the vox machina characters drinking! I love the reference! 1:13
1:49 this guy gives insane kirra vibes.😂
I love how they chose not some kind of fictional store but instead chose Walmart
Absolutely pulverized him once Tholomew got the wand. Love the story and the animation.
DRAGONBORN YEA!!!
I HAD A CAMPAIN EXACTLY LIKE THIS POG
I love how the moment was “I’m sorry and thank you for coming back” to “murdering him with acid”
I need more dnd
This was cute
Is it just me or does jaidens power seem a little familiar (JJK inumaki)
Jaidens dragon looks a little too much like Susie from Deltarune 🤔
I have a crush on Paul
More?
The vax machina refernece at the beginning was so good 10/10 show
wowzaaa
4:15 there is the beast from over the garden wall
Not me realizing that luap is paul backwards
Alfarad is just Larry from Pokemon scarlet and violet
How did I miss this?
nice use of city trial for the boss fight
Was perfect !!!!!
In D&D I just made myself into a walking bomb
Why...Why none of my friends likes dungeon and dragons man?
Undertale version when?
Loved the Vox Machina cameo.
This makes for great story telling
This sounds like the best campaign.
Ironically I finally hit subscribe right before you showed the button… After sneak watching for years.. 😂 So.. Yea..
This video was awesome.
Song name ?at 8:17
MORE!!!!!
Could you please make another video like this sometime! ples!
1:40 bro is Kira
Haha my group is so unhinged. It consists of like 14 people. I am a barbarian gnome named Brock with a magical god rat!
OMG!!!!I love your video can you please do a nether ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This was the first video I saw from you, and I loved it. Your story is amazing, and I pray you keep making more of these 😭✨️
14:06 best moment lol
Why does he look like Sanji from one piece
Fun fact! I waited for 5 months so that this video to be translated from English but then i just give up
If I get into dnd, it's because of Jaiden.
“Pepper sprays Paul, who… just is… disappointed at this point” 😂😂😂😂😂
Самое грусное(для меня) в моей первой партии в D&D это то что я был мастером
VOX MACHINA!
Jaiden's animation self, roleplaying as Zoot, shape-shiftting as Ella. Is there any Jaiden left at this point?
Vox Machina right out the gate, I love your animations. So glad to see another critter, and one with her own platform
I looooooove that you used Mario Galaxy for the ex wife section 😂😂😂😂
Oh my god I want to see the actual campaign i love dnd
Seeing Fuecoco in the shadows is just so funny-
BROOO… Now I’ve got something.. INSPIRATION.    Thank you Jaiden, Slime, Ranboo and Alpharad. this video was very funny to watch and take inspiration.
that was amazing
I’ve upon a time I played DnD and it took us a hour to climb a gyat damn ladder and no it wasn’t a special one either
It doesnt really surprise me that Jaiden played a dragonborn
I know this video is old but can ANYONE tell me what the song in the background is from 3:14-4:35 THANK YOU
Don’t listen to him he’s a zebra lol
i like how mark never attacks at all
Gotta love the Zelda Wind Waker music.
I dont know if this is intentional but, I Just noticed that Jacob's character looks like Larry from Pokémon Scarlet & Violet
Please don’t get too into dungeons and dragons, I knew someone who’s neighbor was so into the game that he committed suicide when his character died in the game, poor children went to go on the trampoline in their backyard just to be traumatized by a corpse less than a foot away from them
So no one else noticed the cats enemy’s name changed from Thomas to tompson?
before I even watch this..   Your first mistake was not playing 3.5 edition.
jaiden baldurs gate will go so hard
Love how Alpha's character is just Larry from Pokemon Scarlett.
Is that a Vox Machina reference in the Old Oak Tavern??? 👀👀👀
"The design is very human"
Jacob got so sick of his twitch chat wanting him to lose to Larry, he just straight up became Larry.
Ok the sheer creativity, design and animation of this video is amazing ^^ Amazing stuff, and I'm 5mins into the video
Wait, Thomas or Thompson?
Paul Jr 😊
I Have unfortunately never got to play D&D but my sister has and she ate two dead horses
I love your D&D character
this is like my dreams on a tuesday
This is why it's essential to have an artist friend in a DnD session
Paul is the most accurate depiction of me playing D&D I've ever seen
The cat has headerocromia
I love this please more D&D
THIS WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL!
PLEASE DO ANOTHER
I actually had never heard of DnD until Stranger Things...   But I REALLY found out about DnD,  thanks to Rustage...   You Jaiden,  have a new subscriber
CRIT ROLE
1:14 if this is not a reference to vox macima im gonna cry
0:57 aLARRYphad
not the adventure time pony
I know someone who had s*x with a dragon in dnd
15:30 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 *I CANT BREATHE! AH!!* 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I need more D&D Jaiden plz
bro we just started a dnd club at my school. And on the literal tutorial battle, I sniped one of my friends and he got so mad 😭
I LOVE THIS ONE SHOT SO MUCH!!!
I LOVE D&D
1:16 Love that you threw in critical role’s Vox Machina 😆. One of the biggest fans of D&D and Critical Role in particular.
15:22 lol
16:22 I am obsessed with this moment :D
I really loved this and would be happy to see more. :D
Please more of this PLEASE
loved that vox machime refferennce
sych randomnes!! love
This is why I can't eat while watching your videos. I was just trying to take a drink from my soda when I hear... "...immediately pitches the turtle at the door"  And spit take my soda everywhere. 🐢🚪so thank you for the side hurting laughter and burning nose😅
I feel like Jaiden would love Baldur's Gate 3 if she hasn't played it yet!
Slimcl or Slimecicke?
This is SO good. Actually visually seeing and reliving a session …
Pokemon RPG
My favorite experience with D&D was in my first campaign. My character saw a snake so I made him go off the path to use the 15 feet of rope I bought previously to hang him from a tree. It slowly killed him while we bludgeoned him and he died. So I went off the path to hang a snake.
chuckle sammy
Larry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait, if their reliving the same day over and over again how did mark spend years learning dark magic?
Do this again if not...             ILL SUE!!!     that was a joke
Love the adventure time horse at 9:51
Enjoyed it you think i enjoyed it that what's the best animating i ever saw i wish i knew about dungeons and dragons
i love how chaotic this D&D session is, it kinda reminds me of my D&D group
Yep, we need a series of this dnd seshs
That was one of the best DND sessions ever! Lol when's session 2
So this 1 time, my party member and I were ambushed by 4 goblins, aiming at us from 2 holes on each side of the room. There was a minecart I used for cover. Meanwhile, my party member dove into the minecart, *and made an invitation cheek on the rocks inside!* (they were normal rocks, btw)
ZOOT RUINS PAST LIVES
idk if its the name or dragon-ness but zoot reminds me of a kobold bard i played who played a kazoo and had "entirely too many oranges" on them at all times
14:45 This entire part is so screwed imagine a heartfelt moment so heart warming only for you to proceed to try and kill the boss. I love how unhinged Jaiden is during this lol.
I've been playing Tails of Equestria, and this is exactly what makes tabletop RPG's so great. Moments where DM goes "Okay, I guess that make sense?", dice turning fights into slapstick you just couldn't make up, and moments of out of the box brilliance like using depression of all words as a command word. 🤣
can you make second part
Alternate line: Luap embraces his daddy.
This was the BEST episode!!!!!
my vote on jaidens next dnd race is an aarakocra based on the fan-art
4:11 What a nice tree. I love trees.
I don't know what's happening but shit got crazy
i play Dungeons and Dragons i'm a high elf with a pet dragon 🐲
i kind of got hints on what class jaiden and ranboo had picked, with me blindly assuming jaiden picked sorcerer because she had a dagger, i was thinking that maybe she had another one, making 2 daggers. which i think is one of the starting items for sorcerer. also ranboo literally uses music as magic, pretty obviously the bard. but i couldnt find out what class alpharad was. eh, its fine.  i had to edit because i said race instead of class
that was beautiful, thank you.
I must say, you chose the perfect soundtrack for this video. Windwaker, Dragon roost Island, the best LoZ game and song to ever exist imo. ❤
Based dragonborn enthusiast
100% эмоций  100% драмы 100% боевик
Absolute chaos and batshit craziness and I freaking love it! This is the most looney tunes session possible and somehow still gets that one incredibly sadistic moment of Jaiden disguising herself as the villains wife, embracing him and then ACID BLASTING HIM IN THE FACE. Hopefully we get a session two out of this because this chaotic group of characters is amazing!
I really like how in the first part you can see characters from the legend of vox machina :) love this
08:23 ITS WORMING TIME!!!!  That me me laugh😂😂
1:14 legend of vox machina grog kileth Vax and pike😊
Zoot=comic releef Paul and tholamul are the main characters.can the next story be about Zoot, please?
Loved the Vox Machina reference at the beginning 😍 (now onto watching the rest of the video 😅)
d n d
its wormin time
Whatsoever the song that starts at 12:27? It's really coool.
What class is the character Paul
Paul more like luap🐑
So ONe TimE mY ParTY mEMbeR StuCK hIS hAnd iN a GobLins panTs AnD touCheD HiS-
Hey don’t feel bad about asking for subscribers because it made me check and I realized I wasn’t subscribed! I felt so ashamed
Larrys cousin paul is a bad ass
the cow that ice king hid in Adventure time
Can you please do another one🙏🙏
The screampt i scrumpt when IUAP is revealed. hOW DID MY DUMBASS NOT SEETHAT
In one of my DND games, I tried to get some villagers out of the burning village, but my voice cracked and nobody listened. 0-0
IT WAS SO WHOLESOME and then jaiden acid blasted him
Literally said "i miss my wife, zoot. I miss her alot"
I swear to god slimecicle literally could not stop himself from making a pun and he unintentionally gave the answer
Ok … I love this group of chaotic weirdos and I need more.
I see that Critical Role reference… Vox Machina, yeh … I see you… I see you… *nods in approval*
Lol my party carried a sentient door named Mobious around for like- a year.
The villain obviously cast invisibility here, but how did he also activate the bombs, does he have Fast Hands ability? Damaging a target doesn't break invisibility. If he threw a vile of ink then this works as seen probably missed the attack roll. Try Splashing it next time DM should have the target try to avoid it with a dex save that way. Dont get me started on the rest of this combat. If it played out like this its clear we weren't taking the rules very seriously. Which is fine.
funny how she tries to use gender nuetral pronouns but they feel so unnatural that she used he instead. 9:54. Tholemue scans the area looking for traces of "THEIR" neighbor, thompson. Not only do "THEY" discover a pack of goblins that have inhabited the area, but "HE" also recognizes a familiar boot print. All that is word for word and its all refering to Tholemew (whose name I have no idea how to spell.  Just goes to show you can't truly swap a singular for a plural people. Go back to normal please.
best oneshot ever xD
next stop: ordem paranormal rpg
we all just going to look over the horse from adventure time at 9:52? love the little reference and nod to the show
It's vox machina such a cool reference love that show
Gotta love the fact to see Vex and Grog hanging out.
YOOOOOOOO SLIMECICLE IN THE... not the flesh. i don't know what he actually is.
i kinda just forget... slime knows how to play dnd... and he is way to good at it
DO THIS AGAIN WHOS WITH MEEEE
video good
9:51 did anyone else notice the adventure time horse?
🦆
The Over the garden wall nod at 4:15 had me hollering!
I roll to intimidate the wood
me,my sister,Adien,my other sister played D&D together,my sister was the DM,my other sister was a teethling me and Adien were a dragonborn
Do a hundred more of these, thank you
I had a similar story to the second one
Would love to see more DnD animations
Would love to see more DnD animations
Mg.. Ranboo catttt
Please upload the hole DND session!!! PLEASE!!!!!
why does he look like larry the gym learder from pokemon scarlet and violet its kinda funny
that was AMAZING
i can't wait for another of these
I had to watch this video 3 times before I noticed the critical role characters at the beginning in the inn.
Once I sent a boar to kill a dragon and successfully killed the dragon even though me and my team got out of there with only like 2 health points
LARRY!
Please more like this it’s so funny!
Was that the CR campaign one party at the beginning??? Lmao I love that
This video shows that Jaiden, or at least someone on her team, likes Over The Garden Wall and that just makes this video better
In one of me and my friends' first sessions, we were fighting a cult, and one of the members was named Dave. Dave always rolled really bad on attacking. My friend, who was a half-orc barbarian sliced him in half. Now, whenever we roll bad on anything, we blame the spirit of Dave, and if I don't play Megalovania on piano before every session, Dave will be mad and curse our session.
"Solonge, Browser'd" REALLY got me good! 😂😂😂
Wait eloping with an ogar is fun?
Bro is actually Larry
Hope we get more❤❤
14:19 MAN DREPRESSSION TOO😂😂😂❤❤❤
That was beautiful, i miss playing
3:31 3:31 hope everyone fine😂😂😂❤
Is it wrong that I now want a Dragonborn Jaiden plush? I can't be the only one who absolutely loves that design
just realized alpharads character is based off larry (the best gym leader)
This makes me want to play but I’m lonely af 😭
I love it wish to see more
Let's go vox machina in the inn
Bro in DND my friend keeps trying to seduce everything he sees
14:07 *“DEPRESSION”*
DEPRESSION
1:16 did.....did you watch vox machina
“ The restraining order”-Rambo 2023
"they decide to eat the clay" oh my god that is not only hilarious but also absolutely something my overthinking party would do
dnd sounds crazy
I love the little detail that the Riddle Door is made of bronze, the Clay Room Door is made of silver and the one in the Goblin Cave is made of gold
That was so coool
I lost it at "it's worming time"
0:28 I never had cute stories, all our games include extreme violence
Surely no experience can be worse then min- *Jaiden starts to exist*
This makes me want to play since i never have
depression is such a great use for the command spell, absolutely genius. for all my years playing dnd that is so good. god i love new players
British Jaden  1:03
is it me or was pauls intro logue like yoshikage kira
Love how alpharads character looks like Larry from pokemon violet
Bro the ending was so holesome
Personally I do find DnD fun because I actually play it so I'm glad you've tried it
That was an awesome story and I loved every second of it and the fact you tried to answer the riddle with turtle 😂
Of course, OF COURSE, Ranboo is a Bard (I say this with such love)
...Paul scratches are gone in the goblin part
why dragon jaiden reminds me to legoshi damn
Jacob's character was RAD and a total ALPHA in the group personally not to mention his weapon is sick
Paul looks like Aaron Warner lol
this is one of my favorite video because my uncle is a big fan of this game and i never understood it but now i think its a fun game thanks jaiden.
A man I like to glob
I LOVED THISSSSSSSSSSS SOOOOOOOOOO MUCHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
welcome to the best world of games ever. d&d
What's the track that starts at 16:30 from?
Who wants the character which was a goblin. Hypnotized an ork Into believing that they were its mother.
jaiden our fake lgbt queen
Does your characters name happen to be a Monty Python reference? 😅
The DEPRESSION part really got me
Please mooooore 😍😍😍
I sorta want to play...
. . . . . that is not fun THAT IS SUS BRUH
This would be better if Ranboo wasnt in this tbh
Paul is just depressed in the start XD
WE NEED MORE D&D!!!!( I’ve been depressed and needed this)
THIS WAS SUCH A GREAT STORY, I ADORED IT!! PLEASE DO MOREEEE (if you want to)
THERE ARNT CUGERS IN MISSIONS -DarkViperAU
Wanna join my campaign?
1:16 HELL YEAH (if you know you know)
I introduced you to my friend while we were playing DND.
I’ve read a book ( sunny rolls the dice ) it’s all about growing up and dungeons and dragons
iv never played the OG but play baldurs gate 3 its amazing
Watched this high as fuck and forgot it was a dnd video
15:44  Oh, there goes gravity
i would love to see parts of the original session and animated as well maybe having the other members voiceact their own characters XD  you doing the acting is nice for your type of storrytelling,  still for immersions sake the og voices would've been fun to listen too like in that laugh sceene XD
I could actually cry. This is so beautiful. It reminds me of when a buddy played a harengon and bit someone's ankle.
Acid blast to the face was COLD lmao
I love Dunces and Dublin.
8:22 I gotta learn how to say that in Worm voice.
i once convinced some guards that one of the members of my party was a dog
Is there any way to watch this whole session?
As a Mark the way he paused and said "MARK" is hilarious😂
my DM said he made the Spirit Bomb and Soul Punisher from DBZ a canon thing AND THEN said after our session we were going to do a DBZ story
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS sounds fun wish i had friends to play it with :(
One time that me and my friends are playing DND and one of my friend got a one on perception and I the dungeon master told him that he didn't see the 30 traps in the hallway and lost one eye,all of his limbs and the key to the boss room
These characters remind me so much of "The Owl House" I just can't-
What a blast!!!
Paul is Nanami stuck in a weird dimension.
Nice
I like the last bit, the music is Forgo Dedede from Kirby and the Forgotten Land
I subscribed because of this video.  Great storytelling.
MORE
4:15 IT’S THE BEAST
watching this while half conscious and ill, very enjoyable fever dream of a video
What’s the song she used at the end for the background music
Wow. That is the most evil use of Command I have ever seen. >XD 14:07 I'm so glad you had fun. Vox Machina!!!!!!!!! 1:12
I’ve used this one shot about the sheep here ( professor shinebright? Was like the original) as a starter to my campaign and booii was it a ride lol
ranboo cat is something i didnt know i needed
I am making my own bord game. Its like a rpg but bbn you level up and find weapons
more d and d pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee
I AM A GOD AT DND
I desperately need to see the full session
As someone who has never played D&D i am VERY confused
I love the "legend of Vox makina" reference
INSANE WIN FOR DRAGONBORNE PLAYERS. LOVE YOU FOR THIS JAIDEN
God, please make this a series 😩
"Turtle"
MORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
VOX MACHINA REFERENCE IM SCREAMING THATS LIKE MY BIGGEST HYPERFIXATION EVER
Gotta love an aromantic-asexual dragonborn😂😂😂
Paul look an suspicious amount like Sanji from one piece 🤔 Jaden is that the intention
Love it
Can’t tell if there’s gonna be more but I sure do hope so
My kids play D&D with them down
The work in this animation stands out, everything, from backgrounds, to character designs, to the perspective work and, even the jokes must've taken a lot of time to animate right. Amazing work, Jaiden and the Team.
Geez, you maced your party mate? That was such a sheep shot...
Wish I could have a fun session like that!!!
You can see when they roll 20 or 1 in the mud battle.
If you EVER play D&D, then play with wild magic, it’s called that because it makes something random ever time you cast a spell, once I was a sheep, once everyone was gnomes! And once everything was RAINBOW!
JAIDEN, PLAY SKYLANDERS!!!
I l’organisat
1:40 BRO IS THAT LARRY FROM POKEMON?
Haha as soon as I realized that this was A Wild Sheep Chase I was like “wait a minute, I’ve played this!”  (For anyone who doesn’t know, all the stuff about the sheep is from a really popular D&D one-shot published online by Winghorn Press! Also, you should credit them, Jaden!) :)
We play dnd on my bus and we made a slur for dragonborns drigger
YOU WHERE ALSO A DRAGONBORN, YES!!!
I love the vox machina in the beginning
this video is so good that I would like to see more stories like this, it makes good memories of the adventures you have had. never seen such a good and funny DnD video, keep up your work <3  I also liked it so much because it feels like our group that we used to play with before :3
Question: What was Paul's class?  I'm thinking Fighter, but IDK.
He so long gay bowsers... I didn't see that coming, but that was hilarious
"its Worming time 😠!"🐛
My addiction to the Kirby Air Ride soundtrack has been reawakened thanks to 10:38 . Top Ride Sand simply gets the heart pumping while Item Bounce empties the brain.
The way the video started man💀💀
Oh my gosh I LOVE D&D!!!! We play shadowrun!!! You should try that!!!
romodo!!
When Paul’s backstory was going on I randomly thought of yoshikage Kira from Jojo’s
What the song at the end of the video?
the guy in the suit is just nanami in dnd, change my mind
Jaden I saw that group of Adventures at the beginning of your story and I have to say I respect you even more for watching that show for at least 1 episode because that show is awesome(that show is on Amazon Prime right?)
Got to love dnd...
Yay, more Anthropomorphic characters!
i took about 3 minutes to realize she drawn Paul like Larry from pokemon scarlet/violet lol
Now that's what I call a one-shot!
what class was zoot pauls either a barbarian or fighter and thallamews a bard but i cant tell what zoot is
This is amazing
i forgot this is still their imagination
love D&D making a campaign right now trying to add crafting to it
we need more
The Goblin that dealt with himself.
haha
Paul is still working Overtime
I love how Paul definitely isn’t blonde Larry
A man in a suit approaches  Kira Yoshikage: I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.
Paul has  main character energy.
This is the type of stuff my friend group does in dnd😭😂
Ah shoot there are furries (i hate furries)
Wait... so Jacob just RPd as Larry from pokemon?
i love dnd ive played it for 2 years its amazing
As someone currently playing DnD as a dragon born this was fantastic 🤩🤩🤩
I'm left with one question though: How do entirely new people show up in a time loop situation?
Paul is Larry from Pokemon XD
i like that Jaiden is a Dragon
Amazing!
I was wondering what classes your characters are
watching this for the second time and i just realised that in the beginning when Jaiden is setting the scene in the 'Old Oak Inn' characters from Critical Roles first campaign 'Legend of Vox Machina' are in it!! You can see Vex, Keyleth, Pike and Grog sitting together! I love it x
W VID
I love how vox machina is there haha
You draw furrys good
The addition of Vox Machina is hilarious
Am I the only person who thinks that Paul looks like Larry from s and v
Did....Did Alpharad make LARRY FROM POKEMON SCARLET
He called turtle Paul Jr so he can't run away?
Jaiden your my favorite youtuber I want to play dnd and I want to play it with you guys you would make it fun but my friends would make it boring plus I have a great character for it I wish I could but I’m to young and my parents would say no! So I just have to keep dreaming I guess
5:08 Is that a riddle or a pun? KEKW 12:36 ō_ō
So two furrys and just a dude going on an "adventure" nice
Did you purposefully mak Jacob look like Larry from pokemon or is it just me?
litterally best intro to a group becoming formed
Great D&D story but after the room of clay what happened to the turtle?
Do another please
That was weird.
I LOVE D&D  Edit: Thank you for the sub reminder. I could have sworn I was subbed but apparently not.
"Jaiden furry dosent exist it cant hurt you, furry jaiden"
VOX MACINA
LUAP BEING PAUL JR GOT ME
facist
imdidnt notice the adven	ture time reference at 9:52 until now
“DEPRESSION”.  It was super effective 😂
This brought me much joy😂
all of the over the garden wall references i love it
Why was “Bong Water” an option for naming that turtle… WHY WAS THAT AN OPTION JAIDEN-
Yess I love the kirby air ride music in the background
Paul in the beginning is literally Larry from Pokémon
of course it's larry
illustration along with storytelling is fantastic
I feel so bad for mark
If you like this, you should try Balder's Gate 3. It has the D&D feel with a great storyline, and different endings.
YAY
why am i watching this like a movie
ISTG. I WANT TO OLAY DND SO FUCKING BAD, BUT I DO NOT HAVE THAT MANY FRIENDS.
I subdues 5  people it was crazy
First sessions are always amazing when the enemies kill themselves. Mine was porcelain gnomes that just shattered themselves by missing us
It took some time for me to realize that Jacob was Larry from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet
This was fun to watch bro.
Omg it was vox machina
14:49 WHAT A TURN
When the worm crawled out, I thought that was something else…
As someone who never even seen a DnD game, I'm surprised how out of template the story became.
so cool
Remind me to never open a bar near these adventurers...
I find it very ironic on how jadon chose Dragonborn when here is a bird option
7:47 "lop" has an animation error
Im inlove with paul tbh
This sounds like a pretty fun introductory one shot
My favorite part of this is you can tell exactly when they failed rolls 😂
I WENT TOA D&D SHOW
HOW DO ALL THE GOOD YOUTUBERS KNOW EACH OTHER???? DID YOU KNOW TECHNOBLADE????
A worm? I’d’ve gone with “anxiety”
When I was a kid my father my mother and my sibling Set me down  And we are playing a game of D&D it was my 1st time playing immediately fell in love with the game Decades later I'm playing with a few friends On the same date that I 1st played I started thinking back to that 1st memory of me and  I love it
This is just funny I also died just lol
Can someone tell me the song that starts at 16:30?
I cast thunder spell
Are the goblins in the cave roasting the Ice King over the fire?
Forget dudgeon’s & dragons JAIDEN IS THE DRAGON
How do I know Jayden was gonna be a dragon born
the suit-axe
14:09......  Jaiden's fuckin expression when she screamed D E P R E S S I O N got me rofl  Hilarious 11/10, would love to do a DnD session with you XDDD
he is literally the normal gym leader of paldea but blond 1:45
I love the immediate Vox Machina reference
"SORRY I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, it felt weird" Jaiden, don't worry, we'll sub anyway:D
I love Dungeons & Dragons.
I have a character in DnD called triton, and he's a 20ft tall half orc, (based on a mag agent from madness combat), and every problem put in front of him is usually resolved with him eating the problem
I play a black Dragonborn every time I get into D&D and seeing Jaiden play one as well just made my day
At 4:15 she drew the beast from over the garden wall
No way in my first dnd session I was also a dragonborn😂
More please
this video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
This was legitimately better than Dungeons and Dragons Honor Among Thieves.
The goblins really had a lot of bad luck while combat haha
I love the vox Machina reference!
at 1:16 there is a CR reference, great video!
Why does Paul look like Draco Malfoy-
I loved this video🙂
Hi. My boyfriend watches you sometimes, and I’ve been wanting ask you a favor, can you make a D&D pt2, but this time, please include me as Delilah, Daruk’s eldest daughter.
Why is Alpharad playing Larry from Scarlet and Violet
The is the most ambitious crossover yet
I have an uncle named Paul junior lol
Spirit tracks music goes hard
Omg the vox machina reference hahhahaha
That clay puzzle idea is pretty fun, gonna be yoinking that.
DnD, a board game without the board, or bored.
Don't dragonborns lack a tail?
I'm in a rol group but we're not playing DND specifically. But as also a newbie like Jaiden was, it's being a great experience. We can only do 1 hour each week and our story is a bit more serious and dark but we still have shenanigans like these lol. My character is a vampire of a very wealthy family called Evelyn but she's always having beef with Jailit, the magic user. Meanwhile Erin, a demon detective with a fricking gun is just so done with both of us, but Evelyn is paying her so she just kinda leads the group while we attemp to discover a mystery that may change Evelyn's whole life. And right now we're in the sewers because Jailit heard a name of someone he knew and booked it scared af. Literally if you've never played rol or DND PLEASE do try it, I made some great friends along the way and it's super fun <3
4:14 OTGW REFERENCE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Why does Paul look like sanji from one piece
13:03 bro really just pulled a asriel dreemurr 💀
I love how you can tell when they roll 1s this is hilarious
This was so adorable and fun as an adventure! I’m kind of a darker style DM but this sounded super duper fun! I’m glad y’all enjoyed yourselves!
dungeons and dragons should not be DND and should be DAD
8:21 this is the most slimecicle-y thing i can think of
OMG I LOVE PAUL
I love that you kept the original audio for the reaction to the acid blast
i almost pissed myself with the face jaiden’s character made after ranboo told them about the time loop 😭
They did Mark dirty with the psychological warfare lol.
Please make a part 2!!!
A career animator/cartoonist like Jaiden is actually probably a really good person to have on your campaign.
Makes me wanna play DND lol
8:23 and then he wormed all over the place
wait what class was paul???
Bit late to this vid. But I had my first session this week. I decided to be weird and have a unique backstory of having my character be human that was transformed into a chicken and cursed to forget he was ever human. Dm said it was fine. So far I’ve accidentally destroyed a table, couple chairs, and a tavern… I got really lucky in a support beam
you can hear the king Dedede love in the battle music
Paul just looks so cool
Frickin groundhog day reference
YAY, VOX MACHINA CAMEO! Pokemons on the shadows and the deer horned dude from Over the Garden Wall! The Adventure Time weird as F* horse!  I... Usually D&D can be pretty crazy, but modern day business people as part of the team and as the enemy is... Did they made a new class that I'm unaware of? Maybe a race? Since he was a business barbarian? I have so many questions, but heck, I was very entertained. I've been seeing recomendations of your videos for years cause I watch many channels that seemed to have featured videos with you, but yesterday I watched you play I'm On Observation Duty with The Grumps and this video popped up in the feed today. Clicked it cause it was DnD related and I loved it so much, I guess I have a new channel to watch! Subbed!
Commanding "depression" is the best dnd usage of the spell. I cant imagine a better thing to do in dnd
Make more dnd
This was legendary
9:51… Ice king?
What’s the Jaiden Dragon’s name? 💜🐲
The king dede battle music is great while fighting a crown and a penguin.
Love how Jacob is protrayed as Larry 😂
I fucking love dnd
7:43 you lop, but it sounded like a  certain word you should not say to an Italian
i want to scream Jaden's character looks like Susie from deltarune
I see you vox machina 😏
Let’s gooo, dragon born
More please
I just realized the dragon at the end is storm terror from her next vid😭😭😭🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳🥳
Omg PLEASE make this a series!!! I have to find some friends to play DND with now😂😂
OMG i have a dnd campain that me and my brothers hosted with each other and the oldest is the dungeon master and we play once or twice a month or two
Paul JR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Disappointed they didn’t “do” a dragon
AAAA. VOX MOCHINA SITTING IN THE BACK OF THE INN
Not the OTGW Beast in the background
Honestly, im literally the dragon because... yea
the first 40 seconds are way too true
Bro Paul is just Larry
Did anyone else see the meme in this vid?
I need to know the outro song its killing me 😭
Paul gives off immense Larry energy       I love it
Gobblegob needs to account for Ranboo's smallness before attacking,  that's why he kept leaping over him
Aaaah yes D&D. R.I.P my 18 character's that had stupid death's one died eating potato.
That one OC that has a little too much for a background story 😅
Yaaaa
ranboo catttttt
CHARLIE SLIMECICLE
Dragon jaiden is now added to the wiki
he threw his son... twice
OUGH YO THIS WAS SL FUN TO WATCH!!!
my first time playing D 'n D, my character was a half-Ukrainian named vlodymyr Zelensky, and their main attack was "propaganda" as a joke
I love how ranboo's character is styled kinda like puss in boots
I may sound like a total geek saying this but, is the dragon that you used supposed to look like moonwatcher from Wings Of Fire book 6?
I legitimately empathized with Mark when he said, “it’s just been so hard.”
I loved this video a lot! One of my friends seduced a dead horse in d&d also someone accidentally killed a god
First character was a Dragonborn, eh? I salute you, Jaiden
Gobblegob reminds me of a character in one of my roleplays, Snow Sight. They’re both evil, and died the same way (Snow Sight was monologing when he slipped into a hole, then did it again and finally died)
Majestic.
Wish I could be in that part
I’m currently dming a campaign based on demon slayer and my party just wandered into a fight with lower six and has no clue that it is one of the weakest demons they will fight for a while
This is one of the coolest videos I've ever seen! Amazing story (and a funny one). It just was really cool and is now one of my favorite videos on YouTube!
Please i need to see session 2
Damn bro this was deep and funny at the same time
I totally saw that acid blast coming. Dnd in a nutshell lmao.
Can we appreciate the best part of coconut mall started as soon as the sheep burst through the window? Perfect timing at its finest.
horrible DnD plot...
*THE* peeler. please get it right.
10:53 That looks like the horse from adventure time.
1:16 is vox machina, that's too cool
This is all just a big Skyrim reference
Ye old mart of wal lol
Is it just me or does blonde guy look like Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and violet?
one time my party and i walked into a spirit halloween and there was a giant animatronic so i sung the fnaf song to it and it confessed its undying love to me but later we found a bomb and it blew up and now my whole party is in hell
1:16 Is that Vox Machina I see 👀
3 of my favorite YouTubers!
Not the adventure time ugly horse😭😭
DEPRESSION
You should try out the game Traveler. It’s basically DND, but without magic and set far into the future.
1:16 I love the show "the Legend Of Vox Machina". But you forgot "Vax" and "Percy".
I desire more of this. please.
This is so Dungeons & Daddies Core
When jaiden said "dragonborn" i almost had a heart attack
is this deltarune
KITTY WIRT BENJAMIN FRANKLIN I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE A OVER THE GARDEN WALL FAN
1:14 vox machina
Am I the only one who thought of "Deltarune" while watching this video? Think about it: We have a serious lifeless human, a silly adventurous "dragon looking" girl, and a scardey short furball. 😅😂🤣
I like how alpharad is just Larry
OH PLEASE! Any chance of sharing the stats of the characters? And yes make a long campaign out of it!
This needs to be a series I already see the hallmarks of a great story and i want MOAR
Please make more of these
That game sound actually kinda interesting
Paul’s tie kept changing color
I'm sorry it just the "DEPRESSION!!!!" That got me so much to the point my roommate asked if I was okay
Other than confusing pronoun bullcrap with the dragonborn, very great video. Being able to have a talented animator draw you crazy DnD fun is one of the most appreciated things a group can have. Good video Jaiden.
PART TWO PLSSSSS
When I play dnd, I just shoot fire at my enemies or use my speed ability or Familar (aka, magic pet) those 3 moves are my go-to and are very effective
God damn zoot has to be the funniest dnd character ever… like USING ACID BREATH POINT BLANK!!! Lol
furry?
you should start a second channel for dnd content like if you think so too (I REALLY LIKED THE VIDEO TOO)
I literally predicted the acid blast to the face like .5 seconds before happened and that's EXACTLY what I would have done and I love that
Yess Jaiden! Way to go with the dragonborn!!! Personally my favorite breed :)
Amazing!!! I need a entire serie and 2 movies of this now lol
I love those cartoon references ❤❤❤
"Turtle! Final answer!" 😂
Not rad being gym leader larry from p:  s & v 😭
Cool
Paul kinda..
The goofy part is that at my school we have a d&d club
Vox machina!!!
This was the best thing ever. Im not into DND, but i saw ranboo on the thumbnail and i was like "yes" so i clicked it and LOL
Wow, just wow...
Love the use of Windwaker music.
one of my friends in my party seduced a demon girl and my friend got pregnant 💀
You can tell Charlie DM'd
This one time we were about to go into a cave and were met by a group of monsters at the caves entrance.. i threw a stone as our warrior charged into battle but i missed literally everything.  A monster got into melee range and i used my short sword but because i rolled a 1 it got stuck in a tree.  Luckily our mage rolled an 18 and distracted the monster so i tried to pull out my sword but i rolled a 1 again and only lodged it deeper into the tree.  I was having a really unlucky game. And everyone was laughing at me but i was laughing too because it was so rediculously funny.
Please do more DnD, I would really enjoy more of this.
Bro Paul naming skills are out of this world
15:18 damn I was being emotional and then out of nowhere ACIDDDD BLASTTTT!
Nice Zelda music!
I how they used the horse from adventure time as food In the cave😂
This was amazingly well done ❤❤
im sorry this is the funniest thing ever i cant breathe
✨ye old mart of wall ✨
i love the vox machia ref-
10:40-11:50 XD The whole lore
Of COURSE AlphaRad would play as Larry ffs XD
Does anyone know what song plays at 16:31 ?
We need more animated D&D
Jaiden point blank acid blasts him. Me: laughing hard I was a dragonborn once, and I tried that. Worked. Nicely done, Jaiden. Nicely done.
4:15 You leave those children alone beast! BEAST! BEEAAST!!
I’ve never played dnd but I’ve always wanted to play it as a Dragonborn
no wayyyy, vox machinaaaaaa
I saw that CR reference at the beginning. Jaiden you crafty gal!
This was fantastic
Such good storytelling
Mark Thompson is the second Rasputin
wow paul is strong
Larry ? Pokémon scarlet and violet
This has inspired me to play DnD!
When I picked by form I also pick a dragonborn but I was green And my mom was sir jaeden. Also my name is also jayden but instead of a y it's a E.
are u sane?
As a dnd player my self I can ensure bard is fun as heck
A tabaxi, Dragonborn and human? THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD👏
Huh cool, my first session was more like: we managed to do two fights in two hours, cause every turn took forever since everyone played for their first time. And also one of our group members got knocked out two times, yet somehow the same member managed to roll 3 20s in like what 8-9 turns? We also were missing a team member, bc they had to quit shortly after we started. His character got hit by a sleep spell and we just pretended that they slept through the whole thing (btw. the fights were like three bandits(?mages) and one wolf like creature with two heads).
Man...I wish i was an important youtuber so i could join this type of stuff...
I’ve always wanted to animate my dnd games but I can’t even draw so this makes me so happy
I see ranboo mask in video photo, I CLICK ON THE FUCKING VIDEO
not subscribed
can someone link me the song that begins at 16:31? thanks
Stranger things
Stranger things
SPECIAL ATACK:『DEPRESSION』
I hope y'all play more. Seeing animated D&D stories is amazing
The "proceeds to point blank shoot acid breath from the mouth" got me laughing so hard i was coughing
OH! You don’t understand! MY PARTY (I’m the dm) CAN ONE TURN KILL A BEHEADER ZOMBIE!! IT HAD 107 HP AND there level 3. They also killed a whole kingdom
1:15 nice nod to vox machina
Dnd is awesome my friend is the best dm ever and my character is very cool
@1:35 the curse of live with Alpharad
Poor mark
IDK why but I love Alpharad becoming Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
I unsubed
Omg, I play dungeons and Dragons, and while I’ve played some pretty fun and chaotic games,nothing comes close to this. I’m so glad you had a blast!
I love when the man in the suit approached the dragon in the bar in the background is just a cat character so funny, and I loved it😂❤
The way The way Jacob's character looks like Larry from Scarlet and Violet is perfection. 10/10 no notes
you should get odd1sout in this
Sketchbook
What's the name of the song that plays when they are throwing Luap around? I been searching the comments and I cannot find anything xwx
Hey! Follower of your content in these past few years here! If you and your friend group ever need some DM or want to be introduced to other role-playing games feel free to send a message! I actually work creating roleplaying game content, and am creating some games of my own as well. Great to have you join the hobby! 😄
This is so utterly dnd chaos vibes and I love it
9:51 is this THAT ONE  horse from adventure time?
hello i would LOVE more content like this. please play more dnd and animate it, this was so good.
Oh A Sheep's Chase! This is a good adventure!
I feel really bad for Mark Thomson.
9:14 hehe nice
Clay headcrab
must have been playing theater of the mind if there wasn't a board
Jaiden thinking it's cool to seduce a ogre
The GM busting out laughing was gold. Also Mark is OP if he survived that
Answer me, these riddles three. Then u may come in me...seems legit
I see u put Vox Machina there lol
I love how Jacob's character is eerily similar to an actual d&d character of mine. Not exactly, but the vibe is there.  A Tiefling who's life is literally in shambles with nothing to live for signs a pact with an eldritch being to work as a "field tech" for an office-based corporation. He was a Warlock, his Patron was literally just "The Company" but he was flavored to have time powers, and beyond his high charisma he was just a normal dude reliving the same scenarios over and over again until he got an outcome he could work with. One of my favorite supporting NPCs was "Ben, the Accountant" who literally was like tier 2 support for my character.
I’m gonna try and be as obvious a traitor as I can
She really put Vox Machina in their, but without scanlan?
OMG i love It!!!!
Has to be the most boring shit I've tried to put myself through.   Dnd is boring as shit.
Jaden’s becoming a dnd YouTuber???
MOREEEEEEE
Your DM better give you inspiration for this incredible note taking!
I definitely didn't yell ZELDA MUSIC everytime zelda music started playing
It's worming time!
How did you get Ranboo?!
1:15  Was that  Vox Machina?
4:10
The Vox Machina cameo had me bouncing off the walls. I've watched the current seasons maybe three times now and I'm so excited to see one of my favorite animators referencing them!
10:14 10:16 10:17
Zoot: DEPPRESSIOOONNNN🗿🗿
They ate clay how are they okay??
Zoot:YEEEEET!!! Paul:wth.
I'm dying laughing 😂
DO THIS AGAIN
OMG IM ROLLING ON THE FLOOR AT 15:30 - 15:40
this was awesome
I love DND!
The ending with Paul Jr made me so happy.
Did it make anyone else feel uncomfortable when Jaiden turned into his Ex Wife..... was it JUST me?!?!?
Lol the vox machine reference
I LOVED THIS AHHHHH
How does this game even work
The video was freaking GREAT but the ending propelled it into masterpiece category for me HAHAHAHAHAHA
your mother 😎
It's hilarious when she just point blank acid sprays him
ive always wanted to try playing d&d
Thank for Zelda music
man i  gotta get into d&d
I'm sorry i found this so late, that was freakin' hilarious!
ah yes, the ultimate spell "depression"
Paul looks like Larry from pokemon violet
explain why I just got a d&d beyond ad 💀
How the fuck do you enjoy this? Who tf is watching this shit? (imagining playing)...
honestly id love to play d&d someday but i lack some essential things to do that, like: -d&d knowledge  -people to play with
Oh my god dragon Jaiden and bard cat Ranboo are the cutest thins ever
I just love thalamew, his design and personality, idk.
My DnD character is a Dark Elf paladin.  Orgin: he is a former cult member. The cult started doing human sacrifices. He left the cult joined the paladin order to bring down his cult.  Characteristic: ass hole
dEpReSsIoN
The fact that i know when a Nat 1 was rolled is secretly hilarious 😊
I killed my party member with a slice of cheese.    *Our DM was not happy*
Was Mark getting the wand, using its magic to restart the day every day for 3 years?
Vox Machina cameo haha. God, I love that show so much (that campaign was also good). This was fun. I had a good time: 5/5 Bearded Grogs.   Edit: Also, the sheep was "rampaging." Ram-paging. The sheep, with a scroll in its mouth, was "RAM-PAGE-ing." Get it? Get it? "Ram," like a male sheep. "Page," like in a book. Double pun.
SO GARY FROM GEN 9
Never seen so much action before
What happend yo the turtle
make D&D 2 or else i will spam😈
THE RESTRAINING ORDER GOT ME DYING😂😂
This was very silly.
“Don’t listen to him, he’s a zebra!” XD
Could legit be its own series lol
Paul sounds like the friend who you haven on a life alert so you can make sure he lives when he sends you the 3am text
Ah, yes. The polymorphed sheep hook. Last time someone used that on me and friends we went and met the wizard, concluded that the sheep was a d**k and set off on a quest to make the polymorph enchantment permanent. Good times.
Please do this more
This was so fun to watch!!! qwq It makes me wanna play dnd with my friends again
We still hope to see Jaiden in Paranormal Order someday
I never wanted to watch this video out of Jealousy but i finally watching it and its really cool !!
I love when they said its wormin' time and they wormed all over the place
ohmagaw the 1st 15 seconds of a video have never been so relateable "i have never played it before even thought i would really like it"
yes I loved this can't wait to see another one
I’d love to see Jaiden play fire emblem it’s like dnd anime Pokémon chess and idk I think that Jaiden would love it
I have a bad idea for a dnd character
A note before watching: I love this game please don't discourage people from playing it.
My school's DND campaign had us start in a Ye Olde Wal-Marte. Maybe paul worked there???
this was so good I hope you do more like this
This was real fun and cute. Thanks for this.
Omg it’s the corn guy
THE FIGHTING SCENES WERE INCREDIBLE OH MY GOSH
Does anyone know the song that starts playing at 8:12 when the party starts fighting the clay monsters?
I love the part where the worm said "it's worming time" and wormed over everyone.
The Vox machina characters get me. They really do
I really think it'll be fun for me even tho i never played D&D before But i'm very shy among others and especialy if i use my creativity i feel weird because it feels like they judge me and my likes and feel awkard around me trying to kill me ingame so i can't continue to play and beg to never have to play with me again because of my weird ideas of how my character could look like But it sure seems awsome to play As long as i'm not involved
Eyyyy this old one shot
Once I got a FULL 20 and hit my friend with a rock😭
I am in a dnd campaign and we have met to do it 2 times and we haven't battled yet but one character is worm the bird curse during battle of Ozzie accent mine is ell short for Elmores glue is a teifling and has the curse of forgetting  things during battle another one is spade is a wizard and has horrible health and we have ate their eye,arm,and leg on accident
Jaiden is officially a Dream SMP member
this should be an tv show
you are a furry
idea: what if zoot is the lost soul of the second jaiden in the platinum nuzlocke reincarnated
i love how slimecicle is portrayed as the evil dm in the thumbnail but the players were argueably MORE evil, stupid, and chaotic than the dm in this situation
Anyone know the music used?
If the clay they molded turned to life and attacked them, what happened to the clay they ingested?
La mejor historia que he visto en un tiempo. Me encanta la dinámica de este equipo.
that was kinda sad
Jillian play a live show of you playing Pokémon GO.
Shout out to Alpharad for playing a normal guy. Players need to be more willing to do this. If you are the normal person in your party (not necessarily human but human adjacent. Elf, dwarf, half orc, gnome, etc.), roleplay getting a haircut, or a tattoo, or whatever their scaly/furry/feathered/metal freak can't do. Be like "Ya, I can enjoy simple pleasures in a fantasy setting. I'm not useless when we're in town!"
D&D sure is a good way to learn social interaction and interesting creatures. Made me realize that we're all similar in a way where we are different and we should all do good to each other and the world. Strange but yeah, that's what I thought of my experience.
I saw the reference 💀💀😂😂😂 (voxmachina)
so basically jacob just rp as larry
Show us your v
this was funny and great and Jaiden is so awesome
This has to be one of my favorite videos you’ve ever made lmao
Using the “Mario & Luigi Super Star Saga” battle music during the team attack at 12:15 was a subtle but stellar touch 👌🏼
Casting "Depression" as a Command is truly a pro-gamer move.
More,more and more. I love it❤
I have never played dnd
I may or may not have had a...crap...saga...with an owlbear destroying an outhouse which one of the party members punched the owlbear to death and quote, "THATS WHAT YOU GET FOR CONSTIPATING ME!"
A human, a tabaxi, and a dragonborn walk into a bar... absolute lunacy ensues. 🤣 More please!
more please!
This’ll probably get buried, but does anyone know the music that starts at 12:27?
why doespaul look likw larry from pokemon scarlet and violet?
One time, I was just starting out with my crew, and we had the option between getting rid of this farmer's rat problem, or destroying a flaming owlbear. Of course they decided to fight the owlbear. Somehow we all survived, and killed the thing. Don't ask me how, I don't know
That goblin encounter and the clay encounter seems as though the Dm rolled a string of Nat 1s haha
I love it
Why does Paul look like Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violets
Are the people at the start from vox machina?
Beautiful animation, amazing story & voice acting, and dont get me starts on the music and storytelling. 10/10
14:07 is my favorite part
nice video! i gata say, i love dnd! but im not that good at it, Im a TERRIblE dm   and more good at being a person in a party. lol  Edit: Now i have a few dnd stories and i wanna share one! mmy character is a child, and teh ygot a suspicous emerald. and then.. uh.. THEY DROPPED IT. Huge mistake! turns out that 'emerald' was a mythical item or something cuz a huge spike went into the air and im pretty sure the world ended.
awesome! i can't wait to actually do a campaign for DnD, cus the farthest i've been is just stealing a pig and throwing a dire wolf onto my party's bard
shouting "depression" had me rolling lol
My friend is so insane he straight up obliterates people. last campaign he gouged someone's eyes out
Paul has inspired me. I wanna make an middle aged normal office worker who decides to go adventuring because hes sick of his corporate job and mundane life. And thinking of his office job sends him into a barbaric rage everytime.
*looking at Paul inspectingly* Is that Draco Malfo--
Oh my fucking God that was amazing!
Ah yes, the perfect D&D party, a monochromatic cat-boy, a depressed Ace Attorney character, and a lizard.
a hole anime in a video
I find it incredibly creative and funny that Zoot's casting medium seems to be the magical symbol tattooed on their tongue. Delightful characters all-around in this group story. :)
What about Paul jr the turtle
15:29 y 15:33
10:10
Background music for this SLAPS
Ah!
what class where you? I know you were a dragonborn, like me, but what class?
But Is Dungeons And Dragons A Board Game or A Mobile Game ❓❓❓
I was so happy when I saw this because my dad loves d&d
I find it interesting how narratively, there are generally two different types of dnd games. The first is like this one, a bit more chaotic and focused more on having a bit of a goofier plot and are typically shorter adventures or one offs. The other type is more focused on weaving a rich narrative that really leaves you immersed, shenanigans can be involved (It is dnd after all) but these are in general a bit more serious, critical role being a prime example. A good middle ground is the adventure zone, a longer campaign with some serious and very plot heavy moments, and other times it being a bit more focused on the antics of both the players and the dm. Both can be really fun and some prefer one over the other while others like mixing it up a bit more. As a dnd veteran this is just an observation that I have made by talking to other groups of players over a long period of time and hopefully this does not somehow begin a war in the replies if there are any.
The Wind Waker music is hitting me in the nostalgic feels.
I take offense to this.
ITS WORMIN TIME
Love the critical role reference!
lizard jaiden is cute
Hello
why does paul look like arthur kirkland from hetalia
PART 2!!!!!!!
on a log sits a fluf ball with a nack for makeing  do you let him join          yes +1 :)       or      no
The Over the garden wall references lol
Jaiden it's a cool dragon furry.
Watching this i predicted the whole Mark Thompson thing. Kinda obvious but it was still funny
Paul looks like draco malfoy
This is awesome! I love your videos, and this campaign was amazing. Keep up the good work!
Please, more of this? So funny. 😂
Paulikage Kira
My friends and I recently did this exact campaign and One of them immediately killed the sheep and cooked its dead corpse… Oh god we went so off track XD
Lemme guess ya’lls classes..  Zoot would be a spellcaster, most likely a sorcerer or a wizard as there’s no mention of a being that they get their power from.  Paul would be a fighter, paladin, or a barbarian because of the weaponry and the way of combat  Thalamou is a bard because of the instruments and the spellcasting FROM the talents of an entertainer.
I didn't know that this game existed IRL bc I only knew it from the series Young Sheldon
You are now legally required to make a video on the next one.
Me and my friends in a game killed a werewolf and then sold its skin.
1:40 *assistant to the regional manager
I am a big fan and I subscribed
That was amazing, I love D&D so much
I'd love to see more of this :D
in my middle school i create a D&D club
Yall should've invited me i have some crazy ideas
hahahahahaha
This was so amazing to watch
Oh alpharads the normal type dude Cul :D
oh hey its that Kate Beaton horse donkey thing
WOTC has butchered D&D.....sad
As Pervy the Purge trooper (from zanny) would put it "MORE! GIVE ME MORE!" "I WANT MORE"
I'm only 50 seconds in and already frightened by the people playing
I only played a small game once but I do paint and collect miniatures
What an amazing video!!
Hey Jaiden, someone called ​MIXKI168 stole this video and posted it as there own.
0:39 bro never do that again☠
I shall call Jadens dungeons and dragons experience  The go-onger-fairytale
Wait, does that mean that you were a sapphire dragonborn. Cuz their breath weapon is really loud screaming. Edit: nvm
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS 🔥🔥💙
So how many subs do I need or get before I can join the fun
Let's gooo!!!!
The greatest story i have ever heard in my life. you inspired me to play dungeons and dragons
We need this to become a series
8:22 I liked it when the worm said "its wormin' time" and wormed all over the place
These and the nuzlocke videos are my favorites.
I killed a baby goblin and the mother goblin tried to kill me in my brother’s campaign
one time, my friend just tamed a wolf, and it was my turn to tame or attack. (since there were 2 more wolfs.) I ask my friend, "what is your wolfs name?" and he replies; "poofy" then I roll to attack poofy, and I roll high enough to kill him when the saving throw failed.
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome oh look at that a nat 20
one time I tried to use charisma on someone, not knowing that they were being held hostage, and rolled a 19, before I realized that they were being held at gunpoint
THIS GAME WAS A FUCKING TRIP
i immediately though of bongo cat at 4:54
Legendary
I like to imagine jaiden thought a mace was mace and the dm just went with it😂😂😂
Reminds me of my first DND,  Someone on our team got a 23 or something in persuasion and told a fellow bandit attempting to rob us to empty his pockets and make way for the cliff, We all scream at them to NOT jump off a cliff and I manage to save the bandit by giving him a flower,  We later see the bandit giving said flower to his husband
This is the first time that a youtuber asking me to subscribe made me subscribe. You did the impossible.
Paul got a zebra patterned tie after being turned back into a human A nice little detail :D
Part 2 part2 part2
When I played DND once, I curb stomped a goblin, then obliterated it with magic missile, and then when an officer confronted me about it I claimed that, "IT WAS JUST SELF DEFENSE!!"
I got a level 4 dwarven cleric
What’s the ending song called it’s so good!
Wtf did i just watch? This was just chaos!.... Do it again
My friend who has never played dnd sent me this video, and me who has been playing for 5+ years was like, "Yea this sounds like your average dnd session"
Best campaign ever 😂
awesome vid, jaiden!
0:57 not Charlie turning into loid forger💀
What the fuck this is actually a pretty good story plot
15:00 - 15:25 LOl
Wait until she discovers Baldur's Gate 3!🤣
The way yall was looking at the door after he spoke had me rofl
VOX MACHINAAAA, jaiden i love the references in this vid, i thought i was the only one who watched Vox Machina 😭
ah a wild sheep chase, thats a really fun one shot, definitely recommend it for people new to dnd! Edit: well, it changed from the base oneshot very quickly.
Her telling me to sub worked I would've watched the video and then just didn't subscribe
this whole campaign was just a play on "would you still love me if i was a worm?" lmaoo
I love your vox machina reference ❤
THIS WAS WONDERFUL <3
Literally all I could think of is deltarune lol
I was excited that Jaiden posted but then I saw ranboo or wvtf in the thumbnail and his stench made me gag all the way from my screen😓🫢
what kind of class was your character? I noticed the tongue tattoo and it is cool.👍🤩
I was going to play Dungeons and Dragons with my family              *It's been 3 years*
Dragonroost Isle was a fantastic choice!
Was i the only one who's first thought at seeing Alfarad's character instantly thought of larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
Listen dnd is amazing and my characters are a dragonborn artificer and a paladin tiefling and i love it its the best game ive played. And if you don't know artificers their basically blacksmiths and mine has a gun and never needs ammo due to infusion he made on it and recently we ABSOLUTELY DESTROYED a young green dragon and just after 2 rounds LITERALLY RIPPED OUT ITS HEART
4:15 *SINFF SINFF* IS THAT A *SINFFFFF* OVER THE GARDEN WALL REFERENCE I SMELL? (IS THAT THE BEAST I SEE?)
Lowkey this was heat
I love DND so much- Me and my bf and his friends play every Saturday and it's so fun!!
The speak with animals written in draconic on the scroll of animal speaking is a nice touch. (yes, I translated it)
This answers absolutely none of my questions about DnD... But I would watch another episode.
Are you going to post some more D and D videos
i guess zebra wtf lol
Jayden is Dragonborn confirmed this is a Skyrim reference
Oh this was GORGEOUS. A perfect, classic first D&D session.
14:43 I've seen this reference Before  Well I still stand by what I saids in the other video why because woman don't care about men love like it doesn't mean anything to a woman They can move on just like that, like the retaliation ship didn't mean anything to her but mean a lot to a Man why because we men are more emotional than women are, So yeah
Why dose this remind me of my dnd session
why does paul look like hunter from the owl house
this had to be a one shot xD but this is awesome i loved it i can't wait to play DnD one day myself.
no one: Jaiden: And proceeds to acid-blast him point-blank from the mouth without hesitation  Everyone else: *dies of laughter*
why are they eating ice kings horse costume
The acid in the face had me dieing
14:08 Something is infinitely funny about Jaiden just yelling, “DEPRESSION!” at the big bad.
We need an anime off this
❤😂
Me: becomes the nightmare king
alpharad in the thumbnail looks like he's a sassy mom having an argument on facebook
Please do this again, this is great.
One time i asked my DM to be in a cult so she put me in a cult where the initiation ritual was to have my face be boiled in a vat of blood 😢 the worst part is i made my character an elf, forgot i did that, and made them 19.  My character is a child 😭
Yo did y’all see the monster from over the garden wall 4:15
one time my friend kiss someone after killing there friend in dnd (true story)
IT'S WORMIN TIME
ngl the "YOU'RE MY PERSONAL HELL" line goes hard
you sure thats casual 1:31
please atleast tell ne taght ogre was a woman 0:21
This is the best, I can’t wait for the second part!!!
1:39 My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
I love the Outset Island music from Zelda!! And I'm so glad you had fun!
Loving how Paul looks like Larry from pokemon scarlet & violet lol
I just realized Jaiden drew Jacob as Norman the normal type gym leader in pokemon scarlett and violet 😂
peep the beast from over the garden wall 4:15
You summoned an entire Fandom
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS :D ❤
The Critical Role reference!!!
Charlie slime ice is the best dungeon master I swear cuz he will just make it funny and yeah now I shall watch
HAHHAH A VOX MACHINA REFERENCE
Cool story 😂
Using the command spell to give an enemy depression is definitely not something I'd ever thought of....I love it
wait what about the time loop
The Zebra looks cooler then his original form. He should have stayed as a Zebra.
out of context, this would just sound like someones crazy dream
The over the garden wall reference, omg.
Wow that was so slay
Kinda reminds of Pokemon
Oh my god, this was absolutely the most deranged first time game session I've ever seen, and boy is that saying something!  Can't wait for episode 2!
A crown possessing someone while Kirby music plays in the background…nice 😏
UGGHHH THIS MAKES ME WANNA PLAY EVEN MOREEE!!!   only problem is, i have no idea where to start! Even if i did figure out which class i wanted to be and then came up with a character... I'd have no clue how to join a party or even create one!   Also! Is it possible to technically have a character that is classed as a mage but  they just use very (and i mean VERY) advanced science and illusions? Because if so i already have a character in mind...  This sounds like a stupid question but, are there any limitations to D&D?
havent played the game but the guy in the bar sounds like larry from pokemon
Jaiden doing the "Hey, you should subscribe" Thing is hillarious
PLEASE!!! MORE OF THIS!!
YOU'RE TELLING ME DND ISN'T SUPPOSED TO END WITH EVERYONE DEAD IN HORRIFIC WAYS????
Imagine locking eyes with your ex wife only for her to HARGLEBLARGHPLPPTH acid in your face.
woot for the they/them characters
I don't know whats going on😂
Sheep messenger was foolish to anger Ratchet and Clank when they were Going Commando. (They have the Sheepinator in that one)
have to unsub for the newest vid 😢
This was very cool. It's very reminiscent of Harmonquest along with other D&D animated shows. I would binge watch an entire season of Jaiden's misadventures if she wanted to do more animations for her group.
9:13 OUAGHHH
Why do you never make real animations anymore now you just do gaming
I remember seeing the part where you cast disguise self to comfort the enemy and then use acid spray on his face. When it said this was your first dnd session, I thought that clip would be in it! I loved that part so much!!!
I wonder who could have possible created the goblin names
Vox machina at the beginning!! I love!
LARRY!!!
is it just me or did her sub count go down by a few million
Anyone else getting Nanami vibes from Paul? XD
Slimecicle was your DM? Oh that must of been chaotic! In a good way mind you.
holy fuck this was so good
I play D&D as a High Elf Druid named Esmeray and its my favorite game EVER, AND OMG THATS SUCH A CREATIVE CAMPAIGN IDEA I LOVE THAT OMG
I don't think i should play dnd but this was so fun to watch.
I know this One-Shot!!! Its so fun!  Edit: the dude added so much cool stuff to it! That was awesome to see
I just love how obvious it is that Alpharad’s character seems modeled after that one gym leader in Scarlet/Violet lmao
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome oh look at that a nat 20
"ITS WORMIN' TIME 😎👹"
i love the oot music
my party is apart of my bake sale, set up in a bar. we killed goblins. . . fresh meat for the meat pies. ( our rogue also has three counts of attempted murder)
I kinda feel bad for mark😅
4:16 over the garden wall reference
Is Alpharad Larry from violet 1:43 (that's what it reminds me of)
I can’t imagine how amazing BG3 would be with this group
AHHHHHH YOU PUT VOX MACHINA IN THE VIDEO!!!!! i always wanted to play d&d but my friends dont even knoww what that is so i have to find abother group to play with my brother loves d&d but he never let me join his and his friends campaign
paul kinda looks like "My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
wOw
Man I really like Jaiden’s character design, it’s so goofy
14:08 DEPRESSION
10:40 OS THAT THE ADVENTURE TIME HONSRSE
Flipping the name at the end is gold. Our DM used the name Inona Siti, "It is an Oni." It was one of the most memorable food trucks I've ever visited.
YE OL' WALL OF MART HAS ME WHEEZING 🤣👍
this was such a good time
15:21 caught me off guard
NOT THE GOBLINS COOKING THE HOUSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME
When I play dnd,I die most of the time to my friends missing their attacks
It's wormen time 😅
i love the larry reference
This was so much fun, cant wait for a part 2 😂😂😂
Dude this was great, hoping for maybe a few more dnd vids cuz this was hilarious
I haven't played dnd since the first time i played in highschool where they killed me off in 20 minutes and i ended up going home because they just kept going.. get the feeling the dm didn't like me that much.
did anyone else notice the meme at 9:13
*Jaiden casts “Depression”!*  Boss: I miss my wife, Tails…
14:08 “DEPRESSION”
I can play the role of the shy,kindhearted nature Enchantress named Lila Rose,and she takes care of all the animals in the forest she lives in,and she has three little animal friends,a bunny named Cotton,a squirrel named Hazel,and a bluebird named Melody,she added a fourth animal friend,a orphaned fawn named Willow.
I'd love to see more videos about the cat's character, he was kinda cool ngl
Ok that can definitely become a movie... And now I want to play dungeons and dragons
You're gonna burn
LARRY IN DND CONFIRMED 😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧😧
I LOVE DND!
I feel like everyone’s first D&D character is a Dragonborn.
The Vox Machina reference is great
1:15, I see the Critical Role reference here! Whoever put it in, I see you and appreciate it!
I was skilled in athletics or whatever so i tried to do a backflip (i though it would help us find clues) i rolled like below a five and broke my neck and almost died
9:52 LMOA THE ADVENTURE TIME ICE KING HORSE REFERENCE 15:00 Why was this actually kinda sad. I cried a bit here because it reminded me of when I lost my cat to a fire and later adopted 2 new kittens. 16:44 That was unexpected-
Im so sad I don’t have any friends that play DND 😭
Literally only played D&D once but still riding the high of absolutely destroying the DM's plan by casting "control human" on his main villain and rolling a critical 20. 😂 D&D is the worst -> so it's the best
Our dm is prepping for mine and 2 others first time ❤
Please do more Jaden that was so good
Please we want pokemon videos again😭
Hope you had fun cuz it only either gets better or worse from here buddy
Can't belive you mocked God like that not subbing
Love it! <3
You should definitely do more dnd please
I loved the ending with what you did to the guy it is what I would have done
he just... so long gay bowsers his own son
1: 16 No way they put a Vox Machina reference in this
"I've never played D&D before. So I decided the MOST UNHINGED PERSON I COULD THINK OF should DM my first game! :D"   Great idea tbh, wouldn't have done it any othe rway myself!
Why is nobody talking about the rune on Jaiden’s character’s tongue? That’s such a cool and unique design trait
d.a.d =dad
0:24 gross no
Hey Jaiden! I think you should play this new Minecraft mod called cobblmon, it’s like pixelmon but better and fits with minecraft more and is up to date with all the new Minecraft updates. And it actually looks good. You should do some research on it just to see if you like it. (I love it)
I've never played it but I would love to play it
I absolutely love DND. If you’re ever in Maryland or do you see you’re absolutely welcome to join my campaign. It is so much fun my DM is absolutely unhinged
Jaiden is Furry confirmed 0:56
Paul carry the team with depression
Jaiden you’re a half dragon not a dragonborn
If you don't think a dragon turning into a walmart manager's ex wife and giving him an emotional breakdown just to disintegrate his face immediately is cool, then I don't think we'll get along
The acid blast cracked me up 😂
1:15 took me a second to see this Vox Machina Easter egg but I found it and I absolutely love it lol
14:22 I miss my wife tails. I miss her a lot.
💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
paul was op
ITS A BUNCH F FURRYS LMFAO
Jaidens d and d form looks like susie from deltarune and i love it
THE CHULK ARISES
VEO LOS VIDEOS POR DUDU
JAIDEN PORFAR  PODES ASER UN NULCLOS DE  SUN  O MOON
0:19 19 seconds in and i'm already dying
Does ari like BURT PIE%
This was a masterpiece
pls post more on this chanel🙏🙏it doesnt have to be life lessons but vids
In D&d i jumped out of the boat  to not obey the colonel and it worked :) 👍
GROG
Love so many of the decisions made by both gm and players.
pls make this a series
ok i am unsubscribing
Was that a vox machina reference at 1:16?
I need to see it again.. PLEASE.
Does anyone else here want jaiden to play Mother3????
Jaydenn~ have you try pokemon conquest yet? I think it's a cool concept of pokemon. Ehehe
The clay worm dying like the emoji meme was gold
who wants to see jaiden play pokemon tcg  👇
You belong in jail child doxxer!
Does anyone know the horrible things this woman has done like throwing a kid down the stairs, and having goons all around the country which she has said publicly!
DO MORE I LOVE THIS!!!!
I'm not even two minutes in and I know it's gonna be good. I've seen enough Chuckle Dungeons to know Charlie Slimecicle as the DM is gonna make it a memorable experience for everyone involved
I personally love D&D and this video basically made me relive my love for it :)
12:37 U SPIN!!!
Jaiden y r awesome never stop making videos
Find God
God loves you
Hey Jaiden, can you make a video about Ari? I just think he’s the cutest little bird ever🙂
Jaiden I'd love it if you streamed Undertale or deltarune!
So we gonna forget that she disrespected God???? She gonna burn in hell fr
we need moreeeeeee
OMG YESSSSSSS!! I KNEW YOU WERE MY FAV ANIMATOR FOR A REASON 😭😭 (IMO)
2:44 Coconut Malled 🫡
Jaiden play cuphead
the acid blast at mark was so funny
DND!!!!!
Do more Pokemon nuzlocks maybe scarlet and violet
Just realized Paul beat up his own son
Wow I didn't know your friends with ranboo
pokemon nuzlock😊
More stuff that are welcome
i love jaiden content
Awesome. part two must happen
The vox machina reference
I was hesitant at first because I played dnd and it was super boring (it was a school club with a bunch of middle schoolers who only played because of stranger things and we’re annoying and didn’t really pay attention) and I’m glad it was more about the interesting story and not like the other stuff
I’m gay
So he proceeded to so long a bowser the sheep but in the total opposite direction 😂
THEM JUST GIVING THE GUY DEPRESSION 😭😭😭
I absolutely loved this and it made me want to play more dnd. I hope you do another video like this from another dnd session. The story telling and animation was so entertaining!
IS JAIDEN SUSSY DELTARUNE
Is DND free? i wanna play it with my friends on winter night.
I’m wondering what Jaiden’s character’s motivation is in all of this. They just seem like a bit of a mystery.
At the beginning you can see the  VOX Machina- group drinking in the big oak-tree 😂  Such an amazing easter egg 😂😂
Chuckles the clown: I have been summoned.   "In death we are one. In death we are strong. In death we are the *HONK LEGION* "
Now i wanna try to play DND.
‏‪1:23‬‏ jaiden plese play kirby
I'm stealing the depressed barbarian idea. That was a stroke of genius.
Omg ye old mart of wal just killed me😂😂😂
always wanted to play it but it seems a bit too complicated for my small tiny brain
Story time. So in the very first Dnd session me and my group did, we were in a swamp. There was boat that was taking us all across to the other side. You see, the boat was powered by a magical orb, but if it used to much juice; it would explode. Long story short, there was a Kraken hiding in the swamp, and it was attracted to the glowing orb, aka our moter. In an attempt to get the Kraken to leave us alone, Our Water Genasi picked up the orb with her hand and threw it into the water. What we didn't know was the orb would cause radiation to spread up her arm as she picked up the orb.  So she had to either cut her arm off, or die on the very first session. She chose to cut her arm off, so now our party nicknamed her 'Stumpy.'
WE NEED ANOTHER GAME OF DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS 👁️👄👁️
Loved the Critical Role characters hanging out in your style❤
Im sad😢😢😢😢
Im sad😢
(A Question) what type of bird is Ari?
oh D&D, that fucking game, i still havent been able to create a character because i dont understand it
Jaiden is one of the only youtubers that never tell people to subscribe and when they try feel weird. The other one is Tom Scott
If there was a movie of this, I would watch it!
PLEASE MORE!!! i love unhinged dnd stories like this 🤩
15:20 i gave gotta love the expected but unexpected move from Zoot, i knew there wouldn't be wholesome parts in this 😂
I feel so bad for mark.
PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER DND GAME
I don't know why the peeler is so hilarious but I laughed so hard I think I ruptured my guts.
4.2 million views and only 3 likes??? Something's wrong here; there oughta be way more likes than that! EDIT: Huh. Must've been a glitch.
THERES NO WAY I PLAYED THIS EXACT CAMPAIGN AS MY FIRST PROPER CAMPAIGN I REALISED AT THE SHEEP WHAT WHAT
paul reminds me of larry from pokemon scarlet and violet
If you want a good fossil fighters game try fossil fighters champions
Part 2?
4:47 "I roll to seduce the door!"
4:15 I noticed the Beast, you watched Over the Garden Wall?
Did anyone relize they had ice kings disguise/the purple pony the goblins are cooking from adventure time
This was the gosh darn best. Let's hope more of these adventures can be animated some day!
Paul CARRIES
why are dragonborn so used as first characters? I'm tired of seing one in almost every campaign.
I absolutely love this one shot!!! It's really fun especially for newer players.
Hi jaden, I have a sugjestion can you do an animatin about the game Sky Children of The Light. Please I would apreciate it🥹🙏
❤
thomas or thompson?
DEPPRESSION!
Did anyone notice the gateway galaxy from super mario galaxy soundtrack at 15:13 ?
GIMME MORE OF THIS NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
When zoot says DEPRESSION she literally uses cursed speech bro
No
Please do Pokemon nuzlocke again ❤
I loved DnD Honor among thieves
That Disguise Self + Acid to the face bit 👩‍🍳 💋  Perfect D&D move
I will never forgive you.
I had a glitch with my YouTube and a part of the song GMFU played at 1:34 and it kinda matched
13:01 OOOOHH I GOT THAT
God, these videos are amazing jaiden, keep up
9:51 Ayyyy adventure time horse 👌🤌
Hello dear Jaiden. I was wondering if I could use your avatar  for an school project because the task is I have to make animation (I will not post it anywhere)
You know I was really flat like a lily pad, but now I am gigantic of a hippopotamus😂
VOX MACHINAAAAAA
I'm not 18 and I'm 9 and I don't get to see Jayden animation no fair
Is it a board game or a video game
Yeah I like your videos it's so good and I know you like plushies am more adikttid to them I got seven old ones the first one I got was SpongeBob SquarePants from 2007 or 2008
bro jaiden just DID NOT CARE about that guy. 💀💀
Jaiden your ari its become my Username in all games Ariterra
Jacob’s character looks like Larry from scarlet and violet
This needs to get a sequel, with a brand new campaign
Jaiden disguising herself as Mark’s ex just to acid blast him in the face has the same energy as Travis murdering Santa or the other hilariously pure evil things you can do in DnD.
Play juice galaxy it’s like an acid trip
nah I need a part 2 of these characters to they backstory etc
Let's thank Jeiden for continuing to delight us with her animations)
Why my DND campain can't be THIS fun?
You can tell Jacob put TIME into his description. That was a SCRIPT
You just gained a sub

Luap
I love YouTube. this lady has 12 million subscribers, and I've never heard of her. Lol
Power word depression
I have seen some crazy things happen in dnd. Especially one that was home brewed into oblivion. I could be having the most one-sided fight ever DM'ed and all of a sudden, and I quote "Ahem, Domain Expansion"
So is D&D just Imagine for adults.
It's lowkey weird seeing Ran not being the tallest member of whatever group he's in XD
SHEEEEEEESSSS ALIVE O MY GOD I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A  NEW VIDEO
I saw one of the potential turtle names as Bong Water, thats what my friend named his first character ever and he was a Tortle lol
Was that VOX MACHINA???!!?
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyy Vox Machina! Love that show to death ong
watched this zooted beyond my life and I couldn't get my jaw off the floor the whole time
Ok so I think we got a tabaxi bard? A dragon mage/wizard? And a business man
Jaiden NEEDS to collaborate with SmokeeBee!
No sé hablar inglés XD para que me metí a esta MRD 😂😂😂😂😂😂
YEA DRAGONBORN BROS
Did anyone notice the shadow of a fuecoco in this frame? 17:43 right next to the unicorn with glasses
I play d n d every Saturday it’s really good
Yo te sigo por un canal llamado dubtube... Yo hablo español... soy argentino eres la mejor
I loved watching your d&d play out! It was so much fun. And i love your videos Jaiden! 💜💟
I will pray for you.
Hi jaiden can you play Pokemon x or y
D n d
"Ye Olde Mart of Wal" really made me laugh.
14:09 "DEPRESSION" LMAO
Furries and larry
9:51 the horse from adventure time! Their cooking it!! 😔
1:30  I LEGIT THOUGHT THAT WAS DRACO MALFOY
Idk about you all but Paul gives me MASSIVE Larry vibes
No one: The Goblins: "Dude, let's kill the horse."
why are you gay
pls make more shorts:(
I like the Mario and Luigi superstar saga music
2:54  I have to stop watching this video cause my DM is using the same intro to a campaign.
With the first look at the characters, is Alpharad just Larry from Pokemon SV
You are in my new video!!!
I loved your channel and your animation is very good and I love it
Try any slasher Metal Gear Rising Revengence   for example
I Like Jaiden's Character Persona 👍(I Like Dragons and Cats Too
Hi love your videos and How Ari doing
Does anyone know the name of the song playing at 13:05? I think it was from Pokemon Ranger Shadows of Almia but I can't for the life of me remember
I be honest, this should be new series 😂 most fun i had in a while on youtube watching this
anybody else confused when jaiden breathed psychic energy, looks purple, but is reveled to be a black or copper dragonborn?
The wild sheep chase! I ran that one too lol. I made the sheep have a verbal tick of baaaa when it talked lol. Our sheep was a wizard betrayed by his assistant. Our barbarian gnoll had like 2 dashes and haste cast on her. The furry blur lmao.
I think there will be a sequel
I cant be the only one who saw The Beast from Over the Garden Wall at 4:15
I like all the Nintendo game references in this vid. Great job.
RAGHHHH
the worlds samlesst violinj
I completely understand if you dont contact me
so basically for autistics and gays
JAIDEN YOU WERE ALWAYS COOL BUT THIS IS LEVELS UNSEEN BEFORE!!!
I loved hearing about your first time playing D&D
Omg I need a part 2 so bad
10:53​ Horse from Adventure Time HAHA
The depression spell got me, I can’t stop laughing
I was going to say that I DM'ed this exact adventure to my discord group as the sheep with a spell scroll appeared, but once the sheep revealed its name, I saw that it wasn't the same one-shot, but damn if the start isn't the exact same. Mine was about an elven wizard wronged by their apprentice. xD
oh man, I need more stories of dnd like this jaiden. Please you HAVE TO make more of these videos!!! I loved it❤
Is it just me or does Alpharad look like Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet XD
A great, traditional D&D adventure.
jaiden telling me to sub made me want to sub
I finally understood how does it work! Thank you so much!
I’m so happy for your friend :) I hope that they have a good life with their ogre
The Chulk 💪💪💪
Ranboo’s character asking if the others are new and then Jaiden saying yes is amazing, but the fact that Paul said “ I wish I was “ was absolute masterpiece. This is hilarious.
I play a lot of tabletop games but DND is one that never clicked for me. Idk what it is but I can't just seem to get invested in DND stuff.  I do however know the joy and fun of playing other games in some way.  For example, I take great pride in making monsters for a Werewolf: The Forsaken 2nd edition game. Such monsters have included: Human internet hacker node claimed, religious zealout enemy werewolf, and giant ass toad that was quickly killed in one shot by the Pack's Rahu.  All in all, tabletop games are amazing.
It’s worming time
That game sounded like a blast.
"Would you still love me if i was worms?" -Slimecicle in dead space
love the critical role reference 1:15
I crave moar of this dnd o3o its literally wt i wanna do all the time
so paul is larry?
Jaiden if you're reading this play payday 2 please (if you really are going to play it play it with friends i recomend)
wow this was amazing
This video is so funny Jaiden had sugerention play game of life 2
You forgot to mention Birdy the bird!!!
Wow, its been like a year or something since the subathon and you still are making content off of it. At least I think this was done on the subathon, that was actually a donothon
Try playing Zelda Tears Of The Kingdom (AKA known as TOTK)
Bro where did the the original Paul jr go???
Great story
Welcome to the cult of dnd. It's highly adictve.
15:10 the super mario galaxy music hits different. childhood games ❤
I love that Alpharad just decided to play Larry from the latest Pokemon game. Larry is best Gym leader, makes sense.
I love how Paul is just a regular business man
"Paul so-long-gay-Bowsers the sheep" 😂😂
I have watched this video so much and just now have I noticed Vox Machina in the tavern
It Is just amazing alpharad was larry
TURTLE FINAL ANSWER
do more

Shout out to crispy's Tavern for promoting your content. Fairly new to Dungeons & Dragons myself, but that was a pretty wild ride.😂
1:16 Vox Machina?!
You’ve grown so much in six years I’m so proud of you kiddo
i tried D&D once, yeah super fun but i dont play it anymore cuz i think i ruined it for the others- I thought out loud and were kinda too logic aout the play cuz i didnt understand, the first time still haunts me lmao
Lol i once rizzed up a massive 60 ft tall squid in DnD using my epic charisma skills and my 32 stringed banjo.
14:49 As soon as I saw this I instantly remembered watching a video about this part in the story in the past. Jaiden you monster.
hi :> I’ve been watching you since I was a wee lass, and I’ve been watching you ever since. I love your content! About a year and a half ago I found out I was trans, and I couldn’t pick a name. I was scrolling through YouTube, and saw a video of yours, and I guess what name I picked c: you’re a big inspiration of mine in content creation!  Thank you for your content Jaiden, from Jaiden :>
Amazing just amazing I loved the ending
Get. A. Job. If I can’t have success on YouTube, you shouldn’t either woman.
14:45 Oh god it's the clip.
For some reason, i had a dream about you teaching me how to animate
Alpharad just made blond Larry?
This is a d̶r̶e̶a̶m̶ absolutely gamer group.
This video was great! If you play dnd again you should do another one of these videos 😊
poor paul, getting targeted by everything 😔
Try playing coromon
*alpharad looks like larry.* *why he look like larry doe*
Please jaidennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn .......make a Pokemon video
I have a pet turtle his name is bolty
1:14 Legend of Vox Machina :D. Love that you enjoyed D&D so much! Fantastic storytelling and visuals. Huge props to the DM and party
I love this group, a dragonborn a cat, and Larry
0:57 why does alpharads character remind me of Larry so much
adventure time ref
I like your video. I think D&D is a very interesting game me my brother and uncle play during holidays.
Egg
My only question is, if Mark Thompson didn't put the cat guy in a time loop, who did?!
Missingno
the party encounters a clay puzzle. what do you do? " EAT IT. "
4:15 is the the Beast from over the garden wall?
I kind of feel bad for Mark
I never played dungeons and dragons seems like a fun game
god i love the mario and luigi RPG themes
This was such an amazing story and i found the turtle very funny and the fact yall just straight up put it in your inventory without questions lol
These videos are great! Keep it up 👍
Plz more dnd
this was probably the best campaign i've heard of on youtube.and imagine if alpharad's character dies and he replaces it with paul jr,who is now grown up and looking for vengeance
Yo do you have a giant pikachu plush
hi I a 12 years old and I love your video
What is on her tongue? 3:18
Wonderful!
Hi
6:49 ; That’s zebr-ist. Probably why he got eye-shanked.
Whats the Zelda themed song at 15:26 approximately?
The my bad guy
Fuck
Caught Kirby Air Ride and M&L Superstar Saga music in the background! Wasn’t expecting those!
dnd is great
9:51 AVENTURE TIME REFRENCE???
DEPRESSION!!!!   I'm sad now
my god u can emagin thanos/god/gods
If this happened to become a series, I would be a happy person
JAIDEN PLS WE NEED A UNOVIAN NUZLOCKE 😭😭😭
15:29 Yup... Jaiden is utter chaos when given the opportunity. And that I why I adore this little corner of the internet. Well played Jaiden.
I love how Paul was essentially just Larry with an axe
0:38 that made me crack up SO hard. If I could sub again I would.
Give Paul a break he needs one 😔
Mk why does Paul look like Draco malfoy???
I never played DND before. However, I do know some things about it.   If I do play (which is Unlikely), I would make a character who probably doesn’t like to fight, and normally would play a Support role.
I could not stop laughing through this video from beginning to end, i can see myself watching this over and over again.
Wait was that Vox Machina??? 1:16
Your party is businessman who is dead inside, insane cat on 2 legs, happy go lucky dragonborn and sheep
What a nice touch that the background music is Dedede's theme when the party is fighting the penguin! (8:27) And love the reference to Vox Machina / Critical Role at the beginning in the tavern
I just saw a clip of your mouth mocking God. I couldn't expect something better from a vtuber
God, I screamed when I saw the VM refrence
I feel like we can all agree, that we NEED more of this.
wow
Oh god jaiden turned into a furry in this universe
Paul is literally Larry from Pokémon sv
i absolutely loved this video!!! Lookin forward to more DnD stuff in the future ❤
A 43 year old businessman with an axe, and he slashes everything he sees. I just love Jacob so much
But we must know, how is the bird child?
LES GO PAAAAAAAUUUUUL JR
Anyone else notice that Paul is literally just Alpharad (I think) dressed as Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet? Just me? Also, what wasbthe name of this DND session, and is it on YouTube?
ALPHA IS LAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRY
Really like the deltarune references but you should make this into a podcast or something
Such an awesome video!! Can’t wait for this to become a mini series of yours 🤞
Oh I absolutely LOVE the Critical Role reference! Vex! Keyleth,Grog and PIKE! in all fairness I love the fact that you gave DND a try its amazing.
The sheep is getting thrown as a throwable plushie around the field.
Bro has terrible aim when lunging at people.
Goblin lunge reminds me of a Bokoblin lunge.
Excellent goblin names. Love it
I thought Jaidens screech would stun the clay monster. It just straight up blew it to mush. Leaving little remaining.
I like zebra Alfred
I feel so bad for mark
Everyone who has no friends watching this wanting to play D&D
sign me up for the next session! Please!
watching this before i head to my walmart job
Absolutely loved this! Thanks for this!
Please play more dnd this was golden. When we did the sheep campaign we ended up kidnapping a half orc and making it dress as a maid to pay off a blood debt 😂😂😂
I love how she added the legend of vox machina characters in the beginning
This was a pretty cool video …… almost as cool as the dungeons and dragons movie on among thieves I’m gonna get for my birthday lol
Alpharad really just played Larry
I want more videos like this!
freakin do. way more of this.
🐉
Montaremos al Dragón

What happened to Paul jr (the turtle)?
The amount of natural 1s without you even saying it. Wow.
Hey Jaiden, can you make a video of you playing BTD6? 🐵🐵🐵
How does Jaiden do it? How does she make her stories so interesting? From her IRL animated blogs to her recounting her gaming moments. Wished I had a skill like that but I guess I rolled a 1 in that department. Love the animation as always.
YOU GOT ME FEELING SO BAD FOR MARK FOR A HOT SECOND
This is exactly how vox machina get their series
I got so excited to find out Luap was Paul jr., truly a story for the ages
Anyone know the song at 16:31?
1:13 THE SILLIES
Using the command spell and saying "Depression" is so freaking funny holy crap
Im about to play my first campaign! Im so excited!
Smash 🫡
Ah yes, the normal party meeting in a tavern.
I feel like Paul looks like Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet
This perfectly captures what DND with friends is like. You come in expecting Critical Role but in reality the GM is going to have to watch your characters eat mud. 😂
Hell yeah. Glad you enjoyed, Jaiden.
great story, british sheep/10
I love the Vox Machina reference in the beginning!
So, normal D&D session
I missed this channel, it made my childhood at the age of 6, (i miss ari to be honest)
Oh boo hoo. Let me play a sad song on the world’s smallest violin 14:23
I too played as a bard cat (awakened) for one of my first games. Unfortunately the dm did not allow me to have thumbs so I could only play the bongos :/
9:13 funny meme
slimecicle no way!!!! commented i know him

Я ничего не понимаю, но это очень интересно.😊
I love dnd so much
paul ex machina vs. the peeler 🤣
ARE PEOPLE IGNORING VOX MACHINA???
You look like someones cool auntie that takes you and your friends out for ice cream
I watched this 20 times and still proceed to think it’s the best video ever even though I never played d&d
I saw the Legends of Vox machina in the Old Oak Inn!!!
This is the campaign I could only ever dream of playing in
DO ANOTHER ONE AND MAKE ANOTHER VIDEO RN!!!
Yayyyy ranboo
My current time 4:28
i honestly didn't like that jad-! uuhhh zud? could not become a dragon ----    complete dragon!!
Was really expecting Mark to say "And I'll be denying your request off 👹"
Gym leader Larry Is Mark
the vox machina reference brought me joy
12:03 the Asriel Dreemurr reference >:oo
I got a request for a new video, how you play either pokemon mystery dungeon explores of time or Pokemon mystery dungeon explores of darkness
The never played d&d my response:same
Can you please play too many birds 🙏
Who else thought  Paul was Draco Malfoy?
D E P R E S S I O N
Ok wait holdup I just noticed that the animation at 1:16 is like, very distinctly a critical role reference.   Incredible work from Jaiden and the team, as usual, and welcome to the chaotic world of DnD!
I love this video as a fan of dungeons and dragons and Jaden. This was all of my favorite things in one.
I really love you,you inspire me every day<3
Insane storyline!!!😂
Once in my party i was fighting a dragon and i threw soap at the dragon and it fell and died. so YES i killed a dragon with soap
If you can, Make a video about Samba De Amigo. It’s so stupid it’s funny
Raw. As. Fuck. I couldn't even imagine coming up with a premise like that as a DM, well written.
This is the one and only accidental subscription I am not taking back
THE VOX MACHINA REFRENCE AT THE BEGINNING
I love the Susie reference from deltarune!
PLEASE PLAY ANOTHER GAME
I forgive you jaiden but you haven't apologized therefore you cannot inherent the kingdom of GOD I pray 🙏  you find peace .
Reason number 1134 why DnD is AWESOME!!  Also, masterpiece as always, Jaiden
Proof that D&D can be as fun and silly as you want it to be, and still be fun to play.
Guess I'm not subbing because that intro
Bro I prefer drgborn barb
vox machina cameo !!!
I saw vox machina there and i was like :v too good
The story begins at 1:00
Is Paul based on Larry from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet? Cause if so that’s amazing 😂
HELL YEAH 4 WONDERFUL CONTENT CREATORS PLAYING DND
Took me 4 minutes to notice the dragonborn had Jaden's hair🤡
You know, having seen 2 oneshots that Charlie hosted on Chuckle Sandwitch, this did seem similar. But god damn would I kill someone to have you in an actual serious campaign (DMed by Charlie or otherwise) and see you animate it Fools Gold style
Hello jaidan i so handsome
I like the vox machina reference
“Paul so-long-me-bowers the sheep… in the complete wrong direction.”  That is such a sentence.  Only DnD.
I honestly didnt expect jaiden to be a dragonborn fine choice!
You should do more pokemon Nuzlocke
What app do you animate in?
My siblings and me all play dnd and I love it
WHY IS THIS SO EPIC
So umm in my campaign of d and d I'm a five year old and another one of my friends who are in the campaign tried to give me wine in the game 😭😭😭😭
4:15 wait is that a "over the garden's wall" reference? it's the same monster and the turtle is making it even more accurate💀
Jaiden, youre the best USA gamer!!! ❤❤❤ +1 sub 😊 love usa from brazil 🇺🇸♥️🇧🇷
9:51 Finally that stupid horse died even thou its ice king
Btw slimecicle your comment is so true
I have seen from your vids you like one piece especially Mihawk
What happened to ari
Did you know that there is a kid version
Paul threw his son 2 times
Mattholomule x Paul energy
New skin unlocked: Dragon jaiden
Jaiden someone as a cush on u
Hi
It would be nice if you make more of these Videos
Jaiden's character is like inumaki from jjk
I LOVED THIS EPISODE 2 PLEASE
This video so amazing😊
paul is like..blonde larry from pokemon if you gave him an axe and a vengeance
once again im reminded of the fact that i want to play dnd so bad because it seems fun but i don't have any friends who play it and a total of like 2 close friends + the only time i attempted it was at a family party where i got bored and left the table because it was taking an hour to set up
I WANT TO PLAY D&D SO BADDDDD BUT DONT KNOW HOW TO😭😭😭😭
Ironically, I'm new to D&D    wow
Nah y’all gave that mf depression as a attack
So my first time playing I was a magical plant cat that had a huge (two times the size of a human) mothey frien -yes spelt like that- and was all powerful, nothing could stop it. My character also loved bugs.
I love this video
I’ve been wanting to do DND for a while now but sadly I have no idea where to get started😔
15:25 I cried
Hey Jaiden What happened to your  bird?
LOVED this!! Please do more!!
4:11 what a nice tree, I love trees
Thanks to this I’ve started listening to tales of the stinky dragon on Spotify and more d&d things T H A N K Y O U
She used to upload once a month :(
I love your videos. Very cool 🔥!
The music goes so hard at the clay monster battle and I really like the goblin battle music.
I'm interested in this kind of game in medieval times like Ancient Empire or Might and magic
Is that Larry trapped in DnD?
i dont like dnd that mutch but jaiden making it into like a movie and making it funny makes dnd way better  and also if the next one will be as good as this one we want a part 2
I love that the laughing got animated❤
corn
wait so paul threw his son mercilessly at the wand... i mean, he didn't know it was him but  XD
We need more
I had to turn on captions on to see what the riddle door had to say 💀
Hey! I think you should add colors to the backgrounds on ur videos. It would add more life to the videos! Thanks for your time!
The man in the suit is larry. No questions asked
Так что, если я захочу что чтобы Шура спел Ты не верь слезам, то это возможно исполнить?
/amazing
0:56 Alpharad Larry?!
First Final Fantasy is basically DnD. Like, actually, the magic system, some of the races, the enemies (one of them was straight up a beholder in Japan and there are also Mindflayers)
we had a piss pond and there was a town in the piss pond on the cmapain i was aprt of
THE WAS HILARIOUS!
I LOVE D&D!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love how Paul does not give a SHIT he was turned into a zebra.
did some one say murder hobos?
Lolll, is Paul's animation based off of Larry?
15:04 DON'T MAKE ME CRY >:(       15:28 OH NOOO
is ari still you know alive?
DEPRESSION
Jaiden is just like me fr
Paul looks like Larry
Paul threw his son
how do you find people tho? it sounds like so much fun
that was the greatest thing ever. chef’s kiss 😚
day 1 of asking jaiden to play ni no kuni: wrath of the white witch
This was insanity with an amazingly wholesome ending. Wish the guys could’ve voiced their characters, though.
i miss playing rpg so much
Part 2 when
14:21 “I miss my wife, tails.”
dnd my love
I see you, Vox Machina!
Canceled
1:16 a critical role reference in a jaiden animations video?! HELL YEAHH
Today I had a dream where my friend and I were playing some mini-games on the Nintendo Switch, and at the end of one mini-game we met Jadon, I joked "no one plays like Jadon." (We played relaxed, we didn't go far on purpose). Then after this mini-game, Jadon came up to us and said, "Well done, you play better than me, and the joke was good, so keep 2 bobbucks." (in this game, it was possible to communicate by voice). It was weird that Jadon knew my native language (it's Russian) and that she was talking in dreams, so I wrote this comment.
Jaiden why do I get forgot about all the time I make some comments about me being ace and I get told "Then don't be ace"
i thot it was some type of boring rpg game but i whached and it now i have something to do for the next 5 years
Ngl that ending song is kinda fire 🔥 can somebody tell what the name of the song is plzzz
Dude in my campaign I kept flirting with the enemies and I ended up dying because I got crushed by a door that the other players pushed me into
Pt 2
Ive got the adventure this is (loosely) based off somewhere. As soon as the sheep showed up i had a laugh. Its a wonderful little one shot with one of my favorite monsters ever at the end.
Wow this was an amazing story, I was so wowed when the story came full circle with luap turning out to be Paul jr
MOAR
Happy national jaiden day (November 1)
as soon as i saw alphas cherecter i knew it was larry
Jaiden my bird just died😢
So alpaharad just created larry from pokemon huh...
I have watched this so many times and it's still entertaining
thank you for the great workyou make my day brighter
Damn! I wish my DnD ganes were this much fun. And animated. And didn't suck.
Are the goblin names adventure time references?
I would like another end video
So was jacob a berserker, a paladin or wtf is he?
15:56 you can really tell when nat ones happen.
We need an ari update RIGHT NOW.
Is an unborn fetus I’m subbing right now!
Jaiden: if you do think that sounds fun then hey Me: well guess I don't have a choice
that was fuckin sick
Deltarune
Paul seems like he could replace Larry from S/V
THE PENTICAL ON THE TOUNGE OF ZOO IS SO COOL JAIDEN
Is this a Baldur's Gate reference?
Waiwaiwai YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED DND BEFORE!? I'm shooketh
Ok so I have a story about my first DND with my friends and soon to become friends guy. So my one of my friends was the dm and I couldn't make the first session so I joined In later basically one of us jumped down a sewer hole one tryed to scam a goblin of his loin cloth and another tryed to eat some of my potions
As a DND player myself, I absolutely LOVE this XD so chaotic. So. When's session 2 gonna happen? XD
I meant jen animation
Do you know jun animation
We actually use boards in rpgs too...well, not a video for me, 5 seconds in and wrong already lmfao
I absolutely loved the session. That the fun things about D&D you can do ANYTHING! Its genuinely so much fun. I found all the moments hilarious (as expected) and although it wasn’t added in this video I the deal Zoot had with the devil was just gold!
Jaiden! Will you make videos in other languages? Type: hire people to translate your videos. There will just be more people who will watch you and so there will be more subscribers and more views.
what about the timeloop ? XD
1:39 Assistant TO the manager
Dude! Mark with a mini violin when he is depressed ... Golden ❤
VOX MACHINAAA
la famila simpsons vs la familia de peppa pig
Mark never meant to be evil, he was just a broken man. He didnt deserve that. XD
Paul's hot
I liked the part where the worm said "its wormin time" and wormed.
Ramboo as the lil. cat 😭🤣
I wanna play D&D, but I have no idea how to make a character. Also I have no friends that play D&D. Or many friends at all.
jaiden can you please tell me what aninimation software you use bcs i really want to get in to 2d animating but pencil 2d just isnt cutting it 😅
Why doesn’t Rambo sound like himself
Why did the Paul jr. reveal make me laugh so hard?
Happy Halloween Im evee
Spoiler . . . . . . . . . . . . So... Jaiden gave a guy depression...
Paul giving the whole yoshikage kira speech as an introduction
I love how Paul is basically just Larry from Scarlet and Violet
I have been looking for this exact thing. I want an channel of just this.
4:33 mr being in the name pool is a nice jojo reference
lol, pink papi in the credits
What even was this? I love it. 😆
I haven't watched a Jaidyn vid in a while, but I LOVED this one. Reminds me so much of my own D&D game group's antics. We also had an acid blast (Breath actually) point blank...but it was from the male side while making out....very disturbing. The Disguise Self though, priceless addition.
I need more of this!
This was unbelievably awesome
This was glorious! Loved every moment!
Legitimately upset that I missed this on the subathon
i just got into dnd about two months ago. there was a group at my local library who plays weekly but i didnt know anyone there. in an extremely out of character move, i showed up anyway, and asked them to teach me. they were thrilled, so kind and welcoming, and very patient. ive been going every week since. if anyone is considering trying the game out, i say go for it!! see if theres a group at your local library/community center or game store!!
15:28 killed me!
not the horse from Adventure Time lmao
anyone who plays dnd is just such a fucking weird incel
I just realized Paul looks like Larry from scarlet and violet
pal is my fav
Hey Jaiden can you please go to Australia and try different Australian foods please I want to see your reaction please and thank you ❤
Omg is Jaiden back to being her old self and not blasphemous
This is the video that really got me into DND, this was funny and really cool. When will you make a second video?
Ranboo is a furry confirmed
I bet my money that dragon in the air, was in reality Ari
Amazing animation & storytelling! I guess you didn't even think this was possible back then, and now you're one of the YouTube giants. Jaiden, keep it up!     By the way, can I make 2 subtitles for this video? I'll just do it for free, if you agree.
This video made me start playing DnD      I have no regrets 😂
Hilarious, loved it
Ah yes, coconut mall with destruction around. Reminds me when i used a blue shell on my brother in coconut mall and he ragequitted in mario kart wii.
jaiden ,    GOD still loves you I hope you know that
Charlie as a DM sounds just absolutely fantastic 😂/gen
A little sneaky Vox Machina in there. I see you.
That was such a cool story! Hey question, what's the song at 16:30?
Holiwi. Loved your roleplaying video. I discovered them about 4 months ago and I loved them, now I am part of a team and we are developing our roll game. 😆 If one day you want an adventure with cute animals, chaos and magic. Look for Chaos & Magic. I will gladly give you premium service. 😁👌  Sorry for the bad English, I'm using Google translator, I still don't trust my English.
Dragons don’t have tails 🥲
not me making my characters for my players who don't show up with a sheet...
The door is like in your one video with the guy that took your spot
Sad mark
It’s funny when you know when there was a bad roll 😂😂
RETURN OF BONG WATER?
I LOVE how jaiden put vox machina in the intro it made me happy 😂
NOT VOX MACHINA!!!!! LMAO I loved seeing that it’s like my world’s are colliding
Why is Alpharad Larry from Scarlet and Violet? And why are you from Deltarune? And why do I think those things are such random things to think?
As a person that plays a charismatic black Dragonborn (its the sub-species of Dragonborn that breathes acid) that has some magical capabilities i can in fact confirm that what happened at the end with blasting mark in the face with acid is in fact something that is not only possible but something i should really consider doing.
4:33 Mr. President? Is that a JoJo reference?
the moment Mark pulled out the photo of his ex wife i recalled that infamous clip with Jaiden and knew where this was going XD
This is brilliant, I love it!
🫡👍
1:16 Ayy
I like how mark somehow doesn't die
I don't know if anyone else noticed, but Paul gives big Larry vibes (from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet)
Hello Jaiden once again wonderful video sleep to it every night but I think you should try and play terraria it’s a fun Minecraft like game that’s fun so if you do thx
i just realized today i wasnt subscribed XD fixed that
Love the addition of Vox Machina in the inn 😂
One of the greatest videos ever! You guys (Jaiden and the crew) totally deserve a Webby or something higher for it!
Alfarad and Jaiden are the kind of bff's that if jaiden wants to do smth but is scared will go whether he wants to either way
Dis sounds like a modified A wild sheep chase :D Sounded fun nevertheless!
Mark weirdly looks like dr. Phil 🤣
Not the wind waker background music lol
Nice
That was amazing! Best DnD story ever, especially for a first time!!!
Paul is definitely just larry from pokemon scarlet and violet
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaass.
Hello jaiden how are you and also how’s ari?
Jaiden, can we collab sometime or can I animate for you? I make animations as well!!
My favorite is the IRS bugbear story.  The party was task with getting rid of a bugbear. And they track it to a cave.  The rest of the party was all “Let’s murder!!!”  The Druid casted ‘speak with animal’ and yell into the cave. “Mr. bugbear? I’m with the IRS, you are overdue on your property tax of this cave you are currently occupying. If you don’t pay up now, I will need you to vacate the premise immediately.”  The bro got a Nat 20 on bluff. And see the bugbear run out of the cave in a panic, screaming.  “Take the treasure and the cave, I’m not going back to prison!!!”
Vox machina was sitting in the inn. And this looked so cool a really cool story.
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is a ✨Masterpiece ✨!
Plz play pokemon fire red
If you like D&D I recommend the board game “the red dragon inn” is a game based on D&D where you have different cards depending on the different characters and their abilities, your goal is to take the others out by using your cards to take away their health and getting them to drink their alcoholic drinks, they get eliminated by their tokens meeting on their board. Sorry if this isn’t a good explanation and you are now probably more confused but it’s a really good game! It’s one of my favourite games
You guys have no idea the physical pain i had when she said the managers name was mark thompson. If youre from hawaii you get it
GASP THE WILD SHEEP CHASE LESGOOOO
I loved the vid but can you plz scarlet and violet nuzlocke
Hey Jaiden ive got a question. Why aren't you uploading videos anymore
Hey here's a stupid recommendation!  Pizza Tower is a stupidly fun game
I love how Jaiden’s character is like Susie from deltarune in a parallel universe.
I love your name :)
Yeah, this sounds like a standard session of D&D.
This was one of the absolute best D&D parties I’ve ever heard!! 😂❤
4:11 i love trees
Hey Jaiden why did you delete your Minecraft video?
YO THE BEAST FROM OVER THE GARDEN WALL
At 9:51, you see the adventure time horse
I wish i could’ve been there, I was a mediocre artist that had a large DND obsession.
I know that Thomlemew's class is a bard but what are the other twos classes?  so glad that you have become a DND player, welcome to the jungle!
LOL 0:26
ples more like this
Jaiden if your reading this your the best animator❤
“Invisible force they couldn’t see”
Mark Thompson was a great bbeg
I tought Paul and his kid was not going to be his kid and were ganna make out
Gotta love that fable style demondoor.
Alpharad is just... Larry?
Ive always been interested in dnd but i realized it requires a ton of teamwork between players and imaginations and i just cant do that. Not the imagination part but the teamwork part. I just cant think how a proper dnd game would function, much less how id do in it.
I love the Mario & Luigi franchise music in this. So nostalgic for me
this video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
What if she played hollow knight?
Finally videos I like so Please make more videos i know you do not like to be told what to do but I love your videos when you make them so much and I will subscribe for you and I already subscribed so please make more videos 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
WoW did not see that ending coming 😂
You can play as a cat???????????????????
the animation made the story seem so much more alive, i love all your videos but especially this one
I think everyone was waiting for the acid blast part
I can’t get over how Paul bears a striking resemblance to Larry.
The realization that what luap meant 🤦🏾‍♀️👍🏾👍🏾🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️😭🤣🤣🤣🥹. I loved this!!!!❤❤❤❤❤ more please
I SAID ZEBRA I SAID ZEREEBRAAAAA.
I think my favorite lines from this were "IT'S WORMN' TIME!" & "Don't listen to him, he's a zebra!"
Me and my friends really want to get a d&d board because of this video
Honestly, I think I’m just so surprised that this was Jaiden’s first DND game. I dunno why, I guess I just expected them to be… not proficient, but an experienced Murder hobo, if that makes sense.
unsubbed. Your words were incomprehensible at times, and the story was boring start to finish. I despise hearing people use the word 'they' as a singular pronoun, too, which was a constant annoyance in this video. I might not have unsubbed, but you told me I should at the start if I didn't like this. Goodbye channel.
This sounded exactly like some the shenanigans me and my friends used to get into.
We need more of this comedy goodness!
Wild Sheep Chase!
I think I have played this adventure, its called Wild sheep chase.
The legend of Larry
this was a fun animation and narrated greatly. I'm planning on building a dnd session ,my first ever and watching this tell me anything's possible and just to be ready for it. More or less.
It's cool how everyone looks like there characters
I want more DND animation
My dnd group consists of what is essentially a group of furries. I’m not even joking, all of us are animal related in some way lol
The music when MarkThompson is zapped by the wand is awesome!
More please
[SPOILERSPOILERSPOILER]              Im gonna be honest here i was lowkey moved when Luap turned put to be Paul Jr.
These adventure time references... The violin, the horse thing on the goblin's fire
I may just be ignorant, but what is the name of the song that plays when they win the fight against mark? I really like the vibe of it. Also, good vid! Acid blasting scene had me cracking up!
Hey jaiden please play cassette beasts it is really good monster tamer game
Instead of "My only child, Paul jr, ran away at age six" I heard "My only child, Paul Jr, ran away at 86" I was shocked the first time
So question, what was the deal with Ranboo's time loop? Did they break out of it? Was it all in their head??
This was so unhinged I loved every second of it
Command spell “Depression” is the funniest most wild way I’ve heard that spell used and I’m absolutely taking it for my next campaign
Hey jaiden are you planing to play more dnd in the future because I really like this type of video you made
Imagination rhymes with haminations
Anyone know the names of the songs in the intro and outro?
I love the adventure time reference with the horse
good
Hahahahhahahahha
Love ya jaiden ansolutely hilarious!
OOOOOH i do like that
IM SUBBED TO ALPHA
Saya tidak mengerti bahasa inggris
Hey jaiden, I just wanted to give you a gameplay themed video idea, I think that a pokemon randomized nuzlocke would be very cool, btw your videos are great! keep doing this good work
i Love this so much
jacob is now larry
4:15 The Beast is upon thee! 😳
Sending ❤
Vide
I litterally swung from my chair and order d&d on Amazon a second after finishing this vice
9:52 ICE KING HORSE ICE KING HORSE
I’m a Dragonborn
Is Jacob just meant to be Larry from s/v
A dragon a deppresed man and Ranboo walk into a bar.
What is Jaiden's charictor's back story
You should try making this into a whole series. I feel like DnD is always full of random, unexpected moments, and it just makes the whole game more fun
1:16 finally some one else who watches vox machina
Kinda cringe
Do you know how much time I've spent trying to understand what DND is? And you just explained it perfectly in under a minute. You are really a fantastic YouTuber
Jaiden play yokai watch
Damn jaiden is old
You should try yo kai watch PS: Its better than digimon
0:24 literally 24 seconds in the video and im going like 👁👄👁
AMAZING VIDEO!!!👍🏼
I love that you added in Critical Role!!!
Who think's we sould give jaiden a million subs. Press the like and sub button.
4:55 "Answer me these riddles three, er the other side ye see!"
The way mark teleported was the same as Obito from Naruto, its a nice reference.
i once tried to make a character that isnt powerfull, but have some cheats, if everything is possible, i made him a power of summon a giant bubble of water, as the bubble incrise, the amount of particles that it creates make the enemy lag, reducing almost every stats, whit a chance of lagging him out, but, as abusing a bug/glitch to get advantages over enemies is cheating, there is a chance of my character gets banned and lose every thing, reseting his ability, like the player made another account, it was a great suport, but didnt work for long becaus the god banned the id instead of the account
THAT PLOT TWIST. OH MY GOD THAT WAS AMAZING.
loved the critical role reference in the beggining
I feel like D&D is shaped around the DM and the people you’re with. Experience changes with how you guys agree with how the session grows. Glad to hear your first experience was a good one! :)
do warhammer 40k please
PLEASE give us the recording of this
9:13 Life just be like that, huh.
I can not get over the idea of Blonde Larry with a battle axe instead of tax files.
the guy named pual looks like Larry
Did you notice that the goblins were eating the horse from adventure time
nuke
Does anyone know where to buy the game?
I loved this so much 😂
Paul is best boy
Jaden do you please play terraria on your channel
15:28 It was so beautiful but THIS part got me dead on the floor XD
I think you might like links awakening  Also I loved this type of video
1:15 AHHH ITS A VOX MACHINA REFERENCE JAYDEN ILY
Id love to play DnD myself but I got no friend's that like it and Inever played it before
The bartender should have been apart of adventure
I lost all my respect for you 😔
My first campaign was chaotic. We were sitting around the table, and there were a few others in the group of the summer camp that weren’t playing with us. Only my character, Luna Moth, could see this demon thing. I told my party. And without a beat, one of the other members was like: “Schizophrenia?” And the entire room died laughing. Anyways now I’m playing as a Tabaxi named SpottedSoil for my current campaign. We’re causing chaos. :)
cant get over ranboo’s lil cat guy and how well animated everything is
OMG VOX MACHINA IN THE BAR
3:08
Hi Jaiden. As I was watching shorts I saw that you had a problem with life i think. Amd so I wanted to be your subscribe. Hope your happier 😊
0.0 I’m getting ptsd flashbacks now I’m traumatized
A C I D B L A S T
What letter of the alphabet has the most water? ( the c)
Very good 👍
I don't know anything about Dungeons and Dragons, yet I recently joined the club in my high school. This Monday I had my first meeting, and made a character named Robinhood. Anyway, this video was really entertaining and relevant to me, and I enjoyed it!
Ranbooooo!
You pronounce it ram boo not a RAW boo
Commpletly unrealated (sorry for spelling) but can u animate a nuzlock of Let go eevee or pikachu
I just found out I’m not subscribed 💀
I don't like þe new Jaiden animations anymore i only like þe old 1s not þis! Like þis comment 4 þe old 1          I like þe old 1 bucuz þe LIVEs R 2 loŋ 2 watch
More Pokémon pls
Good
Sounds fun and overly complicated
Love the vox machina reference at the beginning
I SKIPPED TO 15:28 FROM 15:18 I WAS SO SURPRISED
I am SHOCKED Jaiden didn't immediately jump on the chance to play as a Kenku or Aarakocra
I love that jacobs character is just fucking Larry
I love dnd
Was Pauls desighn based on that normal type gym leader?
My favorite part was when the worm said “it’s wormin time” and wormed of everybody
Doom&Death
“DEPRESSION!!!!!!”
Hope you are doing ok Jaiden I love your work. You always manage to bring a smile to my face with ur videos. As a fellow first time dnd player I hope you have fun with dnd. Remember that ur health is important. Stay happy.
I'm convinced Paul is an alternate reality version of Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
You shoulda used a kenku instead of a Dragonborn, woulda worked better for this campaign
I wish I could make such good characters as those  And probably even play D&D using such  … man, why the hell haven’t I tried yet? Like, genuinely?
what is the song thats playing at 3:30
Because of this video —- I found out you can play as cat folk and now have created a new dnd character for my next campaign 🐱  I AM SO EXCITED
Hey Jaiden did u see  the Fnaf movie
charlie and ranboo's abrupt laughing after jaiden's character acid blasted the villain killed me 😭😭 i love these guys
THE EX WIFE AND KID WITH MUSTACHES 😂😂😂
Paul 🐢 jr.
You can tell when they roll D20s....and...D1s....
What an amazing DM he must be lol
This video was so funny, I almost died choking on my milk.
Ok
ai no ai plal wit mai friend ervie time
We need part 2
epic vox machina reference
Nice 👍
Last time I played D&D I set my entire party on fire.
I loved this so much!!!
Nice Vox Machina reference
Ronboo
when we started our dnd sessions as 13-14yo we had more believable plots than that. And those included randomly appearing Legandary Super Saiyan Broly in a Dragonlance setting.
I loved this!
i love the realization part when Iuap was reversed into paul 😭 we all said ohh at the same time wtf 😭
When are you gonna play digimon cyber sleuth
My party has a Dragonborn member named Yeetus Maximus. He adopted a goat off of the side of the road, and another member of the party (also a dragonborn) jokingly said that he should name it "Yeetus the Foetus"    Yeetus the Foetus is loved by all
Does anyone know what website or app they used for the character sheets and organising everything??
Can we appreciate that how much jaiden does not like god?
Did anyone else notice the adventure time horse being cooked
This really makes me wanna play now... well between this and this podcast channel i found. Seems like so much fun and my mind works in such a way that seems perfect for the game
I saw your Over The Garden Wall reference, my my I do spy with mine eye
One time my friend rolled a Nat 20 to eat puke
I live in an area where it’s near impossible for any to actually own let alone know how to play it. That’s why I never got into the game, but I always was interested in it. Most people play Yugioh and magic, I stick to yugioh cause I grew up with it.  However I’m always wanting to play a story on table top but again no here has the time nor interest in it.
It's worming time really got me
I would literally listen to Jaiden tell any story 😂😂
U N S U B B E D .
my sister has been playing dnd for the first time too, one of her friend is a hippo, and within the first session, they already threatened to give him to a kid for x-mas
THE OVER THE GARDEN WALL REFERENCE IN NAMING THE TURTLE- MY HEART
rip door face he sploded
justice for mark
OMgGGGG i need moe of this, this was so so cool please make a animated DnD Sereis if ur up to it sorry my spelling sucks im not fixingi it
GET ME IN ON THIS!
can you do DND again?
SLIMECICLE AS A DM?! That must be amazing
"ye ol Mart of wall" is the most amazing thing any one has ever said
i plan on signing up for a dnd club in my school
I want to join them
omg the music killed it
why is this video my chaotic energy
jaiden how do you animate im trying to animate a video right now because OBS studio wont record my stuff i need help
As a Wal-Mart employee the manager Mark as a villain is such a relatable thing lol
Did no one notice the “ye old mart of wall”?!?
Hi I just noticed today that my older brother is always named Jaiden! Twins! ❤️ -Jasmine
OKAY BUT 9:51 IS AN ADVENTURE TIME REFERENCE IM LIKE 99% SURE AND IM LOVING IT, SAME WITH THE LITTLE SIMON PETRIKOV DUDE RIGHT AFTER AND ONE BEING CALLED GLOB
I loved this!! I love DND and it always makes me happy to see other people's experiences and stories, especially animated
I literally thought that the explosion was going to use the trigger and kill everyone and not actually explode behind them like a cooler thingy. 💀🤣😂
from 15:23 to 15:33 had me dieing of laughter
WAS DAT AN IMPACC FWAME???
Are you in ps5 spiderman 2
This was amazing!!! You did amazing job capturing the story!!
Jaiden I love your videos can you please make more
LOVED THIS DND is the best
Wait, the part with the goblins in the wood building area reminded me a lot of the ending goron room in majora's mask, then the flippin' majora's mask music started playing what the crap?!?
These videos just make me happy
Did Boyle the goblin die?
This one 12:37
paul looks like larry from pokemon
Jaidens sense of humor has upgraded along the years and as an old jaiden fan I’ve loved her videos especially Pokémon especially this 12:35
I need you to get your DM to record most of the lines for this just feels wrong hearing your voice knowing you’re a player
without a doubt, it was the best story of four friends
The critical role reference was nice
“Depression!” I can’t.
Very good
It's been a while since I watched Jaiden, but knowing it was D&D related made me click instantly 😭
You're fired 16:31
How do you explode an Inn by casting Speak with Animals? That must have been one hell of a Nat1.
What is happening 16:23
You're my personal hell 16:11
Depression 14:08
Make another one like this!
I love that Paul is literally just blonde Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet!😂😂😂
I've watched it 5 times and it just gets better
So uhhhh we just not gonna talk about the time loop that somehow ig broke itself because it’s very obvious rans charecter hadn’t been through any of this? Lmao genuinely no hate loves this this was the chaos I expect from most dnd games love all you guys
Lol
👍
can't wait to see ya live.
0:35  that line was on point i unintentionally subs your channel
Hello Jaiden! Are you a viewer of cheeky cherry Chanel? If so cheeky cherry is my classmate friend!😄(this is true because she told me once in her video that you are a viewer of her Chanel) thanks love your videos
Do this again or just like bordgame animations they turn out super good
i like this game i try to play it but i dont have a group
I’ve never played this before but it sounds amazing. Only if someone would do it with me…
as much as i love the gaming stories its getting to much like we still haven't even said anything about short Jaiden
a dragonblood for a first character. and she's got heartburn, too. :) that was a fun session. :) a lot of out-of-the-box thinking. ^^
My dnd character it's also a black dragon  But i have fighther class
this was breathtaking
i was so waiting for a self destruct
she not funny and rude
This isctis the second d and d animated adaptation for a campaign I've seen besides vox machina, I'm all for this trend.
funny
One time, i was the DM for a party, and they burnt a forest down with a jar of infinite lard.
hold hold hold....Zoox?....da dragon?.... MY USER?....+ MY OC???
2/10 effort
Are you still friends with Alex Clark?
Jaiden is a gamer now, from telling stories of her life to this. Love it.
Pooh please do part two!!!!❤🎉
I had a DMPC for the the new Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen campaign, and it was Epic. My friend's sister played a 2ft high Halfling monk, and we all agreed that I would cast Catapult on them so they could perform a Mach 7 Dropkick.  I also made a custom subclass to legalize me doing this, because I'm running the campaign and no-one can argue.
"Zoot!  You are bad, and you should feel bad for making those animals eat clay.  Tholomew, not much better." "I- I'd like to point out that I didn't eat the clay." "Yes, Paul.  And you know what?  I am proud - I am proud of you, for not eating clay."
Omg the vox   Machina
This video makes me want to stab a wall
**when you realize Paul was throwing his son to get some antler**
Jaiden can you please join the Hilarious Larry's 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
The thing about Charlie is that he's a crazy good dm. But he is also a really funny player. Yall NEED to listen to his d&d podcast "Just Roll With It". It is a very good story and Charlies character Gillian is one of my favorite d&d characters in all the podcasts I've listened to.
omg best jaiden animation video ever I'v allmost watch every single vid btw awesome work out there
At around 1:10 you can see 3 of the cast members of vox machina and the tifling from the dungeons and dragons movie
The villain had the same name as my dad!😂😂😂
Now i want to see the entire session from start to finish,  uncut because this shit is FIRE.
D&D art attracted me. I'm a new D&D enjoyer.
One of the best videos you've ever put it 10/10
“ ItS WoRmIn TiMe”💀
No way Jaiden is good to finish a part of the campaign, I never finished one😢
Hi! I'm 10 and I Love your videos! I always watch your videos at dinner and you have made me watch Mario Kaizo while eating breakfast too, lol. 💖🐲
I've started my first game with my 6th grade teacher and some friends I will now be trying to use my charisma on the dragon
This was awesome!!!
it was too good! I want more episodes please!!!!
OMG I LOOOOVED IT, AGAIIIN PLEASE
Hey jad I'm anonbinary  (Asexual and non binary
What happened to the turtle? :0
I love that paul is just Larry from pokemon
What you be posting on redit🤨
Omg that was great! My first D&D session, I went to check how long the dead horses were dead for. Found out that the dead horses were, indeed, dead. Who knew?!
Rank sitting cuties gen 1,2,3 and 4 of Pokémon NOW!
AGAIN!!!!!!
I cant be the only one feeling bad for mark...
Я один из русских который смотрит в английской озвучке а не на русской
That was absolutely fantastic content and I watched every second of it laughing lol
Everyone who watches vox machina goes crazy because of this scene, including me 1:15
I always love seeing peoples' D&D stories, especially since they often remind me that somewhere, in some far-off part of the world, there exist people as utterly unhinged as I
The goblins were roasting the poo-brain hoarse from adventure time haha 🤣
Try to Play Undertale Pls, Tell James to make a video on Undertale, OR ELSE!!!
DND fans are satisfied.
I loved this video so much it is so much fun, I've always wanted to play dnd
Poor paul...
I love when you can tell someone rolled a nat 1 😆
How many Nat 1's did this campaign have?! LOOOL
1:15 I see you, Vox Machina
Do Undertale now! I cool
Critical Role/Vox Machina reference at approximately 1:14. NICE!
So... Did You watch the Legend of Vox Machina???? 👀
"I've never done that before" *me subbing*
Wait... Where's the turtle?.. DID THEY LEAVE PAUL JR.(Turtle version) INSIDE WHEN IT EXPLODED?!
Is that the horse from adventure time?
That shameless plug oozed alpharad
This was a great video!
I’m a dragon born to👍
Can someone please tell me all music that is in the video?
Omg the dragon at the end zoots mom!? Jk jk
Ñ
She had the Pokémon Rangers theme playing in the boss cutscene! 😂 I can’t even!
i love how zoot is just named after a blunt
I already love this DM chaos for everyone !😂
Nuzlock pokemon nuzlock pokemon nuzlock please
This.was.AWESOME can you please make more videos like this
please make another 10 of these me and my gf loved this one sooo much ❤
Amzing whached so meny times
paul kinda-
Yep, this is about how our session go
What have you doing this 3 months
the end with the whole altering into mark's wife was just unhinged lol
BIDET!
Your videos are always growing and always out to a whole new level. Loved it as a D&D player and QSMP fan! There are parts where people roll high or really low and can't help but laugh.
Loved it !!!
The fact that i noticed the most legendary party of Vox Machina while being in the Old Oak Inn had me in shock
ye old mart of wall
Larry from medali town
So…is no one gonna mention the fact that if Laup is Paul’s son that means Paul yeeted his son twice-
I just appreciate the Vox Machina rep at 1:15, critters represent
1:14 Is nobody going to mention the Vox Machina easter egg?? Well, I just did!
😂 Jaiden would be a professional in a d&d league if she didn't make YouTube videos.😏👍👍
Amazing video
Me and my dad my siblings just started playing D&D and it's so much fun
the super mario saga battle music hit home
Hello Jaiden! How are you? I just want to tell you that I watch your videos in Spanish, but I'm learning English, so greetings from Ecuador. (the channel where I watch your translated videos is called DubbTube Latino)
The time the sheep came in reminds me of a campaign where me (the blue overpowered sorcerer Dragonborn) and the giant orc and we decided to carry it around after our bard knocked it prone where every once in a while the giant orc and I would play catch with the said sheep It was a completely different campaign
Jaiden did you mean for alpharad to look like Larry from pokemon
I LOVE THIS FREAKING GAME
ranboo trying to main character himself with the time loop shit and immediatley getting "no sorry theres actual plot here" by charlie and it never comes up again lmaoooo
I've never played D&D either but this channel is pretty cool.  Great animations and storytelling!
YOUR FIRST TIME PLAYING DND?! I STARTED WHEN I WAS IN 5th GRADE! 😨😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 #❤Yourvideos
👍
PLEASE DO MORE
YES
I love how Alpharads character looks so much like Larry from scarlet and violet 😂
7:37 is just... I have so many questions...
The vox machina cameo in the inn made me way to exited!!!!
Lmao hilariously amazing
Lmao hilariously amazing
The Vox Machina bit at the beginning was a great touch
I ran this one shot I think. Nevermind
this was so frickin hilarious and now i want to play this game  also carl damn
One time my friend killed a troll by singing California girls 😂
This is great as a almost 2 year player it’s great to see complete newbies compared to me, who knows the rules but forgets almost immediately after getting told
Hey jaiden I just watched your animal video and a great candidate could be a schneiders skink
I’ve never played dnd ever in my entire life because I’m not a nerd but this does look fun
I’m convinced that would be great as a video game make the game as you go I know very little but I decided by not playing one day to create a character it’s a ball tank like the circle robot from Star Wars and it’s bullet and potion proof and shoots tank shells
I have a champagne tmmrw with my friends!
Can we talk about how Alpharads character is just normal type gym leader Larry
Zoot is my favorite character in this story
this was beautiful... /gen <33
Great story!
15:27 marking this funny.
Lmao I caught a shiny yanma while listening to this vid lol
Les goo!!!! All the goats in 1 dnd group
I WANNA PLAY DND SO BAD BUT I HAVE NO FRIENDS
Wow pls More
MORE MORE MORE MORE
Not me noticing the vox machina easter egg
Jaiden is the type of person to roll a nat 20 and still lose
Kayleth and Grog in the pub 1:08 (｡♡‿♡｡)
I need more🤩🤩🤩🤩 this made me laugh like a hyena
Vox Machina??
Should’ve called the turtle polnareff…
I'd love to even see a campaign for that but the hell to organize that will probably mean it never will happen sadly...
Pee pee poo poo
THIS NEEDS TO BE A MOVIE 😭🙏
CRAZY FUCKING VIDEO. (i'm baked asf aswell)
Love the Over the Garden Wall references!
SO LANG, ME BOUWSER
As a Dnd player myself, OMG I FREANKIN LOVED THIS!!!!!
Oh no.. oak turning into the worst species of wood…       ugh it hurts me to say this even type this but.. B I R C H
Omg, I just want to play DND now. We stop when covid happen... :(
9:53 is that the hirse from adventure time
I unsubscribed and resubscribed to support your first time ❤
I have to play D&D that acid breathe to the face got me 😂😂
Good
This was a lovely watch ^_^
just when i thought i had escaped from my hyperfixation on larry...
DanadD sounds really. fun. Also,  do that again, and also, I like the random im Paul
Nice vedio❤
8:22 ITS WORMIN TIME 😻
5:04 "What's with the voice? I couldn't hear a word of that, could you repeat it?" *The door looks very pissed off.* "I'm sorry if my supernatural voice isn't what you expected, I only get to talk or move every 50000 years!"
jaiden, if your looking into dnd i gotta recommend an ongoing animation series someone made out of a very good campaign called  "fools gold" not only is the animation amazing and the story incredible, but the humor reminded me of your videos
LARRY.
I loved this ❤
Bro why does Alpharad’s character look so much like Larry from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet wtf
THE SUBTLE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE IN THE BEGINNING, YESSSSSSSSSS
Replay hollow knight
Interesting story about the first game.  I don't know this one yet.
God damnit i have to unsubscribe look im sorry but dnd dosent sound like something i would really "enjoy" per se,
i need more dnd stuff RAH
I like how Alpha was literally Larry but instead of Pokemon training for his neutral special, he weilds an axe
4:41 ranboo is a bard; cast heat metal and remove the door
paul is literally the larry trainer card and its hilarius to me😭😭
My fav D&D characters Cat, Dragon and Larry from Pokemon. XD
Do not watch this while sick, I have a bad cough and genuinely almost died laughing. Worth it though.  Edit: What a freaking awesome DnD session. I love Pauls character.
I loooooved this vid should definitely do more like it!! So funny
The best part is that all of this is completely standard for D&D.  None of this is far-fetched.
Great
More? Please? 😂
The fact that the character in the middle looks like Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet has had me rolling with laughter for quite some time now
I’d love for this to be a show so badly !!!!!!😂❤😂❤😂❤❤❤
Vox Machina at 1:15
so good!!!!
Lmao this is like- every dnd session I have ever done- I mean, throwing a sheep go get a magic wand is hysterical
I like how one guy just became Larry from Pokemon but younger
This is my turtle... his name is Bong Water
I have been inspired
Please do this again!!!
15:31 I like how in this scene, Jaiden, Ranboo, and Charlie are laughing while alpharad is just in shock😂
Pee Is Stored In The Balls😎
This was awesome and I loved it❤❤❤✨✨✨
THE BEAST! From over the garden wall! I spotted him! And the turtle names.. nice
Which classes did you guys use?
GIVE US A SEQUEL!!!!!!!!
A referência a mario 64 me quebrou
Paul looks like Larry
the vox machina easter egg!!! loved it
You should speedrun wario wars.. not the new (trash) one, the ds one- mostly cause I remember you saying your ds was broken a bit but also cause the ds version feels more nostalgic.
Don't worry you're not alone-
Are you a Dragonborn?
Just thought I should share the best DMing in the history of my campaigns: We robbed a bank and our awesome DM had guessed we would do that and planned an entire boss battle in the vault while our necromancer distracted the guards by protecting innocents and kameameaing his zombies with silent image  - it was insane and the best time of my life PLZ MAKE MORE DND VIDEOS! :D
1:15 Well well well. Looks like somebody's been enjoying some good old Vox Machina.
in my first campaign, my friend fought a dragon... while i sat there as a dwarf eating a sandwich.... the best part is that i got like just 20's and 18's for like... 5 turns
Make a Pokémon nuzlock
I want to play dnd so badly but there’s rules
Do more d&d please please please please please please please please
For you next animation you should tell a story... A story called "The Big Swell"....
I once shoved a mentally unstable man in side of my sentient bucket of holding
I swear using a Dragonborn for your first campaign is a universal experience 😭
That was beautiful!! All inspiring and I would love to try my hand at dnd in the near future as well- as soon as I get myself some friends to do so haha *I'm lonely*
REAL SLIMECICLE, HES ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE YOUTUBERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
Thieves was cool as hell!
This was amazing.
I love the Critical Role easter egg!
Love the vox machina reference
So when do you play digimon: cyberlseuth?
Justice for Paul
Just how many nat 1s did they get?
please, more
Make a part 2
i have not played DnD,but i love watching DnD.
how long did this session take you
Is the polymorphed sheep with a speak with animals scroll a common set up? Since I started playing dnd online I've only played one one-shot outside of westmarches and it was a story with a polymorphed sheep that wanted to be turned back by a magic wand.
9:12 was that the vanishing emoji meme?
I was thinking about learning how to play. I di not wish to play anymore.
Was Tholomew a sage wizard?
the enddddddd thoooo
She really said I love you sike and then acid breath him I have never laughed so hard 😂😂😂😂 14:53 to 15:31
That battle axe turned into bardiche lol
So Paul is just Larry from pokemon.
Zoo Zoot or Züt?
<3
The guy in the suit kinda looks like Larry from Pokémon
I honestly understand D&D now… And to go super saiyan Kirby style!!!GO SUPER BEAM ATTACK!!!!!
Id love for you to make more videos like this. Ive been wanting to try playing dnd but dont know how to get started
The Vox Machina cameo....perfect
Literally larry
the best video on the channel tbh
I LOVE THEM, I NEED MORE OF THEM
Nobody: The dungeon master: *starts singing to whats going on* doo doo doo doo doo doo
DND DND DND
Awesome 👍
shout out to paul for being the most normal human ever
I saw Ranboo and I have never clicked faster...
Tell me who's watching this in the future? (Like 2024 pr something)
And this is the main reason why i want to make a D&D campaing, i have characters ready i just need a Dungeon Master and 3 more people. But time will tell, and when the time comes the curse shall be broken
Why is no one talking about DEPRESSION?!? That was an amazing use of the command spell. 😂
the way jaiden acid blasted  mark makes me laugh xD
Love the Wind Waker music
Hurt watching this
Nice video
15:30 was soooo unexpected is was hilarious like i still laugh about it to this day and i saw it the day it came out
The whole slow talking door thing got annoying. I'm not finishing this video 😂
why is paul roland from lor LMAO
Cool how you put the superstar saga music for the duo attack
I am so happy that the trolls stayed on that one video. Dnd or death!
THIS IS SO COOL I’D LOVE TO PLAY DND AS WELL
I love it
A recommendation for a great word to use for Command if you are in a large tower; self-defenestrate. It means "throw yourself out a window."
good
THE OVER THE GARDEN WALL REFERENCES, GREG, WIRT, SKIPPER, JASON FUNDERBURKER, BEN FRANKLIN etc.
Nice vedio ❤
can u make another dnd storry i enjoyed it so much!
Mah mah ama cimminol
Huh
we need the Second Part!
Omg Ranboo is soo cute  And Jayden the dragon I’m speechless speechless I say yoir so talented
Please make more of these! I actually laughed so hard through our most of the video. I can’t remember the last time I felt this much continuous joy 🥹
I recommend pokemon dnd its really fun as its just pokemon but your own game
Poor mark
This was the first one shot I ever dm’d
That was very funny and interesting to watch.
I played this dnd campaign sadly can’t anymore
me who thought it was bryson from haminations😅
i love the part where the worm said "its wormin time" and wormed all over the place
Wait I’m neighbours with a cat?
Alright, let's see.. we've got a dragon, a cat, and Larry? This is gonna be a good one, I can feel it!
i wish to play dnd from a very young age but when i did i couldn't cause of time issues and then i had a dm who fudge the dice all the time :/ wish all players a good old hearty time!
Half of the characters are Furrys
I removed watching your videos when I was ten and I’m still watching them! ^^
I love this, i have to play d&d now
Now play Baldur's Gate 3
I feel like I kept hearing my name in this video...
This is amazing 👏 🙌  I love the chaotic creativity 👏
Yoooo I want to see more of ranboo’s character SO BADDDD
Charlie is the greatest dungeon master of all time. His little adventures are always entertaining
The Vox Machina gang just chillin'. I see what you did, there.
I’ve never played DND before but I need more videos like this 😂😂
why is alpharad larry😭
Is anyone going to talk about alpha looking like Larry from Pokemon scarlet and violet
You know at one of her videos she said that portle musika song was played over a dancing cat ya I saw that meme
I thought it was a Ron Strampler reference 😂
Love how Paul looks like Larry he should have his own class in dnd
10/10 adventure Cant wait to see what other hijinks you get into
DND FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This needs to become a mini series: Critical Rofl
Now I like slimecicle even more
I would love to play DandD my friend don’t like it though
DUDE. You should’ve been an archer because your Aro!
Was the dragon In the sky at the end a reference to something?
I saw the acid blast moment out of context and I was like "clearly this was part of a massive campaign where Jaiden was previously established to be an irredeemable monster" but no there was no reason for her to do that
i just got dressed me playing dnd lol
And she would pull out to look at marks eyes lovingly and proceeded to acid his face
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😅😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Do more do more do more please
01:15  hmm familiar ;)
That was the most batshit crazy thing ive ever watched im dying of laughter right now
“And…ACID BLASTS HIM POINT BLANK IN THE FACE!” 🤣
Hi yesterday had played two they were both fun. The first one was I was a rabbit who could plant trees and I could make them grow really fast. I didn’t play for that long. It got extremely boring but I still play. It was kind of fun the second one I still have the cat ears from it and I played as a cat named gamer cat, my abilities my powers, my power was teleportation. I was extremely loud in the game in real life and I had the planning I was planning after a while the cats got a hold of a sugar sweetened necklace. Eventually we got it and I hate it there in the game 556 hours later Ivy, Poppy, Poppy playtime chapter 2 I’d be a game in a game that I beat. I beat the first game play while I eat the first game. I beat the game inside that first game. I beat the game in the game that I also beat.
14:06 My dragonborn paladin had Command as a spell and I used it only for interrogation purposes. This however, I should have done against some of the enemies we fought in my campaign.  Also 15:27, that was some pure, unfiltered disrespect right there that had me laughing for a good 5 minutes, well played.
Not gonna lie, I have never played Dungeons and Dragons but it looks super fun, and I don't like hardly anything 😂
legend has it that tholomew is still cursed as a cat to this day
I've never played DnD, but know plenty of people who do. I role-play (not the weird kind of roleplay, the story telling kind) i think they sound very similar, but i feel like DnD just isn't the same as waiting three hours for my friend to respond to my paragraph. (my friend doesn't take that long i may have exaggerated, but they do respond  slowly.) I'll have to try DnD sometime, my cousin played it, but got too into it that she lost touch with reality. I'll have to find some friends sometime once school is out to play DnD.
I'm genuinely surprised Jaiden didn't make an Aarakocra character
16:26 AYO WHAT 💀📸
CRITICAL ROLL REFERENCE ?!???!
Wohooo, my first guess was zebra! And the clay riddle + encounter was cool!
OMG is it the Wild Sheep Chase!?
ALPHARAD=LARRY CONFIRMED?!?
15:28 this is just the best few seconds of the whole video
the criticasl role rfeferenc eomfmgmgmmg
13:11 BAHABHABAHABAHBA 😂
15:28  HELP I CANT BREATHE MY CHEST HURTS I CANT STOP LAUGHING LMAO
Very interested story
Last time a played Dnd, someone in my party collected body parts from every enemy (even from some other party members) and at the end fed all the parts to the final boss which was a big dragon and tamed it, completely skipping the big battle the DM had planned, good times 😂😂
I’ve sudeced a orge before
1:40-2:00  Omg a depressed Yoshikage Kira backstory 😂🤣  *(Imma laugh if people unsubbed, like c'mon seducing a dungeon monster 🤣)*
"Its wormin time" - worm
please does ANYONE have the last song of the video 😭
The answer was zebra.😂😂
what about you do a part two you are a amazing at it bye ✌🏽
The critical roel reference
Average dnd back story
Mad props to all the animators on this one! It must have been a blast, and a ton of work!  I'm wondering though why didn't Luap tell Jaiden he was Paul's son?
I would watch a podcast with this group
Lol, I named my first Squirtle Bong Water.
Good video
MOREEEEEE!!!!!!!
Omg I loved this
Love the subtle inclusion of the vox machina characters at 1:17 LOL
Hey, haven't heard about Ari in a while. Is he okay? Just wanted to ask, sorry if I wasted your time 😅
I adore seeing new people get into d&d. Would love to hear more stories if you continue to play!
Do a part 2

im mad at myself for not guessing luap was paul backwards
Good
PART TWO. NOW.
The bronze door sure did sound like it was speaking in tongues.
Wait was he actually stuck in a time loop or did he make that up?
I LOVE THE STORY PLS MAKE MOR 😮
Pretty fun game if you ask me
Me realising that I have a pet rabbit in d&d
MORE!!!
was ranboo's character's backstory his own creation or a part of the game's setting? Cause das a wild ass fucking story to come up with, but at the same time it's so Ranboo
I’m a DM for my own home brew campaign and all of my players are absolutely insane, it is so much fun watching them just go crazy with all of the shenanigans I provide them.
Awesome
"Oh yeah...DOUBLE OR NOTHING" made me laugh
I hope you make more dungeons & dragons because I really
I love the part when the worm said “ it’s wormin’ in time” and then wormed all over the place
I haven’t even started it, the ads are playing but girlie I KNOW YOU DID NOT ANIMATE 17 MINUTES FOR US
4:10 God, that birch tree reminds of me something.... but what...?
❤❤
Yes, yyeess, YYYEEESSS. Thank you
Very good 👍
I. Loved. This. Hardest I have laughed all year.
Paul = best character
See idk if it’s just me, but Paul (Alphaard’s character) looks like Sanji from One Piece, I’m here for it
Can you do another one that was great
man we definitely need a another dnd video from jaiden
NAA that was surprisingly entertaining
DEPRESSION!!!  -famous words by Dragon jayden

8:23 its wormin time
PAUL YEETED HIS SON TWICE
I love DND
This is what my dreams are like.
Due another
Paul looked a lot like larry from pokemon
what happened to the turtle?
Wait....what happened to Paul jr (turtle)?
Bro why did you have to do that to the manager😢
Is that Larry from ScarletViolet? 😂 1:30
Good
D&d is amazing
I'll never forget the time my WoD ST (Storyteller, same thing as GM/DM) ran a college student campaign with mixed books. Technically, you're supposed to stick to one book at a time, because they're definitely not balanced against each other, but who *doesn't* want a game with vampires, werewolves, hunters, mages, and all the other mystical beings in play? I chose to make a shifter, specifically a were-coyote (Nuwisha) named Ezekiel Wulfric. Nuwisha are capricious, mysterious, and always looking for fun shenanigans, and what they trade in raw power compared to werewolves, they make up for in all sorts of gimmicky but useful abilities (lockpicking talent, being capable of literal double-speak where one person hears you say one thing while anyone else hears something different, there are even some later abilities like Looney Tunes style "if I don't look down, gravity doesn't work on me"). In the course of a single session, before anyone knew better, Ezekiel was left unsupervised. He decided to go prowling around the campus, and went undercover in full coyote form. He was abruptly kidnapped by one of a group of students who had mostly already decided they were our rivals...but he happened to be caught by the only girl of their group (whose name I forget), who was not The Smart One. She saw doggy, and she decided to take the doggy since there wasn't a collar. Zeke spent the next hour or so being cleaned up, with a ridiculous number of bows tied into his fur, to the disdain of one of the other rival students. Overhearing that other student talk about his plans to do something about 'the random stray dog' while the girl was snuggled up in bed with him, Zeke waited until she was asleep, carefully escaped by unlocking the window and going outside, and quickly returning to his own dorm room. Surprisingly, everyone else was *still* busy elsewhere, so he decided to change back to normal human form and sit on the couch, pretending he did absolutely nothing in abject defiance of the obvious array of ribbons in his hair.  My ST both loves and resents my good fortune in that series of events, because it's a fun story where a dozen things could have gone wrong, and instead "Ezekiel, what did you do?" "Me? I didn't do anything." "Where'd the ribbons come from?" "Oh, those were a gift from [that girl]."
Mooree!
Do another Nuzlocke!!
4:22 there are no cougars in missions
I've done a DND where me and my friends were a family of criminals - I was an assasin mage, someone else was a half elf assasin, someone else was completely insane and addicted to benadryls named (I am not joking) - I'm Crazy, and there was another shapshifting criminal, and our bloodthirsty mafia grandma, who definitely did not kill the parents who mysteriously disappeared, and who blackmailed and gaslit her grandchildren into attacking her mafia rival, ending with an assault on a giant metal fortress
Part 2 ppppllllssss!!!!🙏🙏
Bruh here are my favorite dnd moments: I was playing as walter white and there were bandits, but since walter white has infinte rizz he was able to convince the bandits to buy his meth, but it turns them evil so walter white summons a furry out of a portal and it seduces the bandits and walter white escapes(i got multiple d20s in the span of like 3 minutes)
Did not know eat clay was an option but neat
I’d move to see more of these. This was hilarious. 😂😂
This was such a cool video! I'm glad you had fun and props to the animation team!
Lol blond larry
Cool I like colabs
The M&L music in this was great
love the vox machina reference that show is awesome
I love your stories. And the fact this was a DnD story that you actually participated in? Chef's kiss. Please participate in more lol. Have a good one.
1:38 did kira get into your game
I wasn't at the whole game. but I saw the wife bit
Literally right after said so he just showed it a normal conversation and then a display ad came up right after
Alpharad wanted to be the best boy of Pokémon SV at least according to Jaiden
Jaiden pls play Pokemon black 2
Is said cat a tabaxi? I don't know of any other cat race, and trust me, I have spent too long researching the Monster Manual
🤯 laup is Paul backwards
vox machina?
I never new, ‘so long gay bowsered’ was a verb
The ultimate betrayal
"Looks like the manager position...just opened up!"  Is the least threatening, dumbest, coolest, most amazing, but still totally dumb, but awesome, but dumb tough guy action hero one liner I've ever heard ion my entire life. 10/10
I hope you make another video I loved this one
Mark, the Walmart manager, final boss
Zoot was brutal in that boss battle lmao
Nice I see
so is jaiden a wizard?
15:26 is to funny I have be laughing for 7 min now
DEPRESSION!?!?
I watched this whole thing take place. Idk what video it was but it was wonderfull
Bro really hates god 💀  bro just why god did nothing to you thats why something bad is gonna happened to you thats gonna be bad and thats your punishment for mocking god.
Love seeing Vox Machina in the Inn
Vox machina
I play so damn much dnd and you are like, every person in my party. I’m a DM and I absolutely hate the fact that THEY ALWAYS WANT TO DO THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE STORY WANTS THEM TO. They should go to a town? No, let’s go kill a dragon. Kill a dragon? No, let’s go f- the dragon. ARGHHHHH
4:15 I know on my MAMA I DID NOT SAW THAT BEAST FROM OVER THE GARDEN WALL
More moreee morrreee MOOOOOORRRRRRREEEEEE  pls
Paul..... Luap
This reminds my of my first time playing dnd where I was a Druid that just loves turtles and befriending anything they could. So onto the part of the start I wanna share, me and my party members were going into a temple for part of our quest and I summoned a giant armor suit made out of turtles. Think Gundom but like instead of 100ft tall it was like 10 feet tall. I proceeded to use this mech suit to kick a group of goblins against a wall and kill them all because I had gotten a nat 20 on not only my kick but summoning my armor, which gave me a insane buff of plus ten damage on the next 3 attacks. So in total I did 30 damage to all of the goblins in one hit
My dnd session is so funny it’s with my best friend and me and him saved some people and then got money but we were told if we save the other people we get more money and then we met this family which in my best friend tries to get with one of their husband’s and after the wife said no we left them behind and went out for homophonic chicken where we met the husband and then my best friend flirts with him and fails but is still rewarded with a kiss on the cheek and I just stand there and watch
Please play more D&d lol!
Ok, but VOX MACHINA!!!
You should make this into a podcast.
good
Hey I know this campaign.....
good
This is the funniest video ever!  I laughed so hard HAHAHAH. Love ur videos jaiden
The fact the ranboo is a cat is funny
I haven't seen a single person mention it, but the Kirby air ride theme at around 14:30 was such a pleasant surprise. I haven't  heard it in a long time and seeing someone use it in an epic moment makes me happy.
Me who saw the random adventure time horse being cooked
I love that show 1:16    I bet no one else got that reference
Nice hahaha
im just gonna dump a story here:  So we were level 3, on our way to kill a necromancer, we were stopped by an owl bear, 2 of us were dealing damage, the other was trying to get a hold of it by getting on top of it, and the cleric was trying and failing to tame it.  Then, out of nowhere, the cleric started to heal the damn thing, and the tables were completely turned, i was on 1 hp (mage) and our rogue was on 3, i needed this to end, so i shot a magic missile at our cleric, nearly killing him  All the while our fighter. OUR FIGHTER was trying to get its attention, after we barely made our way out of this encounter, we finally started to move again, but there was still more.  We arrived at a dungeon (cant remember the name) and our rogue decided to investigate, he then tried to offer up the rest of the party to said necromancer to save his skin, which almost resulted in him getting zombified.  Then, our cleric decides he wants to heal the zombies, but cure wounds harms them, so he uses his warhammer instead, and after all that, we finally won.
I loved the Critical roll cameo!
furry 😮  (that’s a good thing)
I love how Paul is literary Larry from Pokémon SV and i am all for it
I play dnd but we do have a board for our characters and its just fighting and I want to play more dnd games like this, just basically story and some fighting
THE CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCES AHHH
How could you. You sick monster. Mark had a family
this was beautiful
JAIDEN THAT WAS AWESOME
He casts thunder spell! (Sophist moment)
Don’t listen to him! HES A ZEBRA!!! 🤣
I swear no one has commented on the Adventure Time style horse that was tied up in the Goblin scene! Also was that the mech dragon at the end from DingoDoodles very long and detailed animated DnD session????
Can you record your next session? I not that’s fine.
Paul looks like Lary
How did I know they where guna f the ogre 😂
Ranboo Cat epic
Pls do a part 2 or something I had such a fun time watching this it’s the best vid I ever watched in my life
I’m not kidding when i say I got a dnd commercial after watching this vid.
Ok so is no one gonna talk about how alpharad looks like sanji from one piece he's literally a cigarette and a black tie away from being sanji and I rewacthed this over and over and he looks like sanji hell when I first watched I noticed he looks like sanji and also without the curly eye brows that's it he just looks cool
I LOVE THE REFERENCE TO CRITICAL ROLL IN THE OLD OAK INN AAAAAAAAA
Omg I wish I did this with yall this is amazing
Did anybody notice but Paul looks like Larry from pokemon
I saw the vox machina reference good one jaiden
This was such a good vid, I've never seen anything like it! I play DND myself...But sadly the group I go to, EVERYONE IS LIKE 40- (im around 10)
WAIT HOLD ON I REMEMBER SEEING CLIPS IN SHORTS FROM THIS
3:11 looks like I found my favorite charakter😂😍
I've actually called my brother Paul Laup before, so I knew what was up from the start by pure coincidence XD
Jaiden we need another nuzlocke Pokémon please
Paul looks like Larry from Paldea
One time I played dnd someone tamed magical dentures lol
7:30 Door
Bruh Jacob just said "yeah, you know what? Imma make Larry from Pokemon S&V"
You should try pokemon and next
Love Alpha's Larrysona
THS WAS SOO GOOd THO:D
Charlie has time for this but not chuckle sandwich
do more of this, please
What species IsJaidens Character
"I decided to reach out to Charlie, a.k.a Slimecicle... a.k.a Charlie Slimecicle." Ah yes. the old combination of bread, eggs, and breaded eggs.
I absolutely love this new type of video. I hope to see more of it in the future!
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
There needs to be more
Jaiden have you ever played miitopia its a game that you can create mii's but you can only play alone its cool its on the nintendo switch can you play miitopia pls🙏
Hii jaden :D
In one of my D’n’D campaigns I played as shadow the hedgehog (I ran into wall all because of dice)
My dad wrote such a similar campaign oh my god.
A again please
so, i also, have recently started playing dnd for the 1st time, its perty badass.
This was absolutely amazing, I'd love to see more of these!!
Part two please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
worm
suluger bowser
my first and sadly only so far experience in a dnd campaign, my group decided to hunt for a microscopic diamond so they could turn it into an earring for a squirrel
Wuuuuu!!! this was beautiful.
MORE MORE MORE
I LOVE IT
once my cousin told me about a story where they prayed to an orange god and rolled a natural 20 and they summoned a whole army and the story about the ogre basically happened to one of the other players in one of the games I played except the ending was... a bit different
I feel bad for mark 😭😭😭💀
play legends arceus and get god himself
8:23 casual poison ivy from 2009’s arkham asylum boss fight sound effect
I bet Jacob had no input in what his character looked like, Jaiden just thought, "Larry," and that's all she wrote.
I feel like ranboo fits being a Tabaxi
i love the zelda music
16:30 What music is it?
Paul is every Millennial
uhhhhhhhh 10:45
Took ya long enough
I love the chaos here
1:15 YHE LEGEND OF VOX MACHINA!
One time, we were in a bandit camp, and I swung my axe in a circle while surrounded, the bandits were left on 1 HP, and I just remembered I had poison on my axe, so ALL the bandits dropped dead, it was so funny
I LOVED the video! Took a while but it was so worth it!
I really enjoyed this video hoping for a Dungeons and Dragons part 2
Paul sounds like my one classmate xD
U better say sorry for mocking😐
Jaiden never fails to make me laugh
So I counted eversingle year so ari is 7 WOW where is Ari's job?
I love how random the video is ❤
I am flabbergasted by the sheer ludicrous tomfoolery this session created
We have an amethyst dragonborn, a tabaski bard, and a human
What were you threws race and class?
Yoooo cool vid jaiden!
Why is Paul kinda hot tho
WERE THOSE ADVENTURE TIME REFRENCES
I absolutely adore Bartholomew and Zoot's character designs!
I loved it
Jaiden and ranboo, my life is complete
love the CR reference
This was awesome
First minute in and alpha looking like larry killed me
In dungeons and dragons I'm also a dragon born
Hey Jaiden what's your favorite class. Just wondering as a fellow DND enjoyer.
Honestly we need a whole series of just the whole campaign
So Paul is a Barbarian, The cat is a Bard, but what was Jaiden's character?  Also, was Kitty lying about the time loop or was their life just so boring that they thought it was looping?
Is it only me or we need a animated series of this
This is the most D&D game to ever D&D. As an avid player of the game myself, this was so cool to watch
This was awesome it would be so cool for this to be a series:D
Best thing I have seen in my life
Love the casual Vox Machina cameo lol
Paul reunited with his son and the son before turning back into a human, on 12:38 was Yeeted by his father 😂
horse look like horse from adventure time
when did they solve the cat's time loop-
16:09 . Nothing else.
I love how alpharads character is just Larry
It was crazy. I just laughed every time and to be honest I wish some of the phrases were voiced by Ranboo, Slimesickle or that guy with the axe, because it would be even more comical. Anyway, I just created their voices in my head   I LOVE YOU ALL !!! THANK YOU!!!
100/10 for using so long gay bowser as a verb
How can I start a D and D group?
Paul is my favorite character.
Idk why it’s fitting for Ranboo to be a cat
not me crying at the end
I love the use of the Windwaker songs lol
Sounds about right
4:14 YOOOOO OVER THE GARDEN WALL REFERENCE
“And proceeds to ACID BLAST HIM IN THE FACE” 15:28
We need another one of these
this is freaking awsome jaiden hope to see more of this cond of content
Please, I beg of you: Make. This. A. Series!
Am I the only one who saw the adventure time reference with the purple dead horse?
Lol ngl I died on the dragon spitting acid on the Manager XD Rambo character getting a complete underestimate vibe with the wond XD then the two puting the pieces together about luap name XD we need a session two
Would you still love me if i was you -worm- manager
1:16 I've seen those characters before...
My dad does that game!!!
R** sorry I have to
Did anyone else hear mark say I’m hard when he was hugging “Ella”
0:57 Is sorry is that Larry
Tiene colorrrrrr
this has to be the single greatest video i have ever seen on the youtube platform, please make this a series
jaiden and ranboo both realizing luap was paul backwards was hands down the best moment of this
AHHHH OMFG!!! Vox Machina reference!!!
did Paul Jr the turtle just disappear from existence from 7:53 onwards or did I forget my meds again
God, that was so evil. I love it!
1:35 My name is Kira yoshikage...
Hearing the Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga triggered me, cause I JUST beat the game on an emulator a few weeks ago o_o
i love how alpharad was practically just larry but with blonde hair
That was amazing! This video deserves a lot of likes✨✨✨
I also had my first session was 2 weeks ago im NOT a trigger happy gnime artificer(crafty dude) but everyone in my part is so careless i ended up carrying the whole party with eldritch cannon for both  of my current sessions
this is insane
I love how Jaiden casually committed a war crime 😂
The dragon shadow overhead in the sky at the end was *chief kiss*
lol the end got me good as a DND player myself i enjoyed this
I want the full conversation between yall
I love it!!!
that looks so fun!!!
Description: "Music: nintendo stuff", what was the first song??? Was it from Dragon Quest??? I need to know!!
15:30 Insert Ariana Grande high note!
Y’know, cats are actually lactose intolerant
My favorite character is tholamew
I probably wouldn't play d&d, but now I kinda want to
Who wants me to describe one of my DND charecters
I love how Jacob just became Larry 😂
Can you tell me how to animate because I was thinking you could come to my house and help me how to animate, and my mom said that to make a YouTube channel I love your channel
9:50 wait that horse from Adventure Time is actually the Ice King......so ummm.......would that make the goblins cannibals?
The shouting depression bit at the end was very reminiscent of the lich's command spells.     "FALL."
Wow jaiden you're so cool👍👍
Please make a vedio on you playing Stardew valley 😊
This is my favorite channel. Keep it up, Jaiden!
The horse from adventure time
I love the part where the clay penguin said "it's crownin time"
I've played a ton of D&D but my most fond memory would be of my BFF playing a fighter and stumbling on a stair over and over till the rest of the party cleared the fight
So long gay bowser's the sheep got me rolling
This session sounds so fun please upload the highlights or full session I really wanna watch it, by the way love the videos and animations they are really well done
Jaiden Animation and D&D. Fantastic.
Paul has a color changing tie
A while ago, by friend rizzed up a dragon, the old husband killed all of us, and my friend lived happily ever after. Dangit.
Is it just me or does Paul kinda look like Larry from pokemon scarlet and violet
What was Jaidens class!? I really want to should depression and make people sad too😭
sir, mam, miss, is this a harvest moon music i hear?
MORE. Please
Jaiden never fails to entertain us in the best ways possible ❤ Also, WE WANT FNAF CONTENT!! I’ve seen in other videos that you might be into fnaf recently so why not show us! Please..?
hi
WE NEED A DND SESSION PART 2!!!
more animated nuzlcokes!!
Oh my gosh this was glorious  When Paul went into his backstory I couldn’t stop laughing. Such a neat character choice. And my gosh Tholomew has one of the coolest character designs I’ve ever seen, I love him
my dad drowned someone with mayo one time in dnd
I wonder if anyone knows ALL of the Nintendo music that Jaiden used in this video?
Jacob reminds me of pokemon scarlet and violet gym leader larry
Paul pulled the nat 1
A wild God slimecicle has appeared
Funny and scary characters, nice
Even though her gaming videos are neat, I do really miss frequent animations. I’m still really glad that she found what garners her the most attention though :)
No way Paul is reference to larry
I SERIOUSLY NEED AN ANIMATED SHOW ABOUT THEIR JOURNEY!!! THIS IS SOOOO GOOOOD
Jaide please do more of these videos
Having Vox Machina in the Grand Oak was a great idea. Thank you.
Omg that was amazingggg
1:31 A man in a suit? That’s Larry from Scarlet and Violet Jaiden.
I was confused how this was Jaiden's first D&D game until a bit of searching had me realizing Sips was by Dingo Doodles.
Oh shit, the beginning reminds me of this super fun module called Wild Sheep Chase!
Yes
I have over $100 in dice
DND YESSSSS
Love your  videos you inspired  me to make my own  Animation youtube channel
This was an amazing experience, we need an adventure with these four again.
Awesome fantastic
I love the fact that alpharad is literally just larry
in 8 years of dming i've never seen someone play a middle aged salary man
Paul's beginner speech felt kinda like "My name is Yoshikage Kira, I am 33 years old, I li-"
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT "would you still let me be your manager...even if i was a-" turns into worm*
Great video.
Why is Luap didn't say "I'm your son" in the first place?
After watching this video, I really want to get into DnD
can you please donate to against malaria to save lives
This was such a fun little look into a first time D&D game.  All the little misunderstanding and creativity that results from the chaos!
Why is this so awesome
My character was a bard and ended up making a small union of the necromancer's skeletons
Love the zelda music
Can u pls do a sword or shield nuzlocke next?
This is amazing it’s like adventure time  I am definitely subscribing
I love how she added sound effects
Jaiden should turnher videos into a podcast! I would defo listen to that lol!
I honestly loved this video and wouldn't be mad if there was more of these 😉👍
This is amazing. Dnd is definitely a lot of chaos gremlin energy. I’m running Wild Beyond the Witchlight right now and the amount of shenanigans I have to deal with from my players 😅😂
good
The vox machina cast at the start omg :0
once my older cousin got into a goose c*lt (i don't know if i can say that on youtube or not) in d&d
YE OLD MART OF WAL
If i ever feel like the youtube economy is failing, i can always watch your videos and feel a bit better, dont get on the internet kids, especially dont look up loppuny explicitedly. 🪑🦵🔥🗿🤏👃👁👁👨‍🚒🥶🤠😵‍💫😵
Now ya got to do a PMD D&D
the streams of this where it's just the reaction to Jaiden acid-blasting Mark's face is priceless, but this gave immense context and an overall story.  Amazing.
“DEPRESSION” Jaiden -2023
THE POINT BLANK ACID
I always wanted to see a drawn out d & d session that was done and narrated well and I loved this.
I remember running "A wild sheep chase" one shot it's super fun. This seems similar with the sheep stuff.
DO IT AGAIN PLEAAAAASE
I like how Paul gets hit with literal PEPPER SPRAY and he's just disappointed
Do it again
I WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THAT SWEAR     nice rhyme aye
As son as I saw alfarads character I bursted put laughing because he looks like Larry from Pokémon Scarlett and violet just blond 😂
Are you the dragon born?
I thought Paul was gonna do the yoshikage kira line
A Dragon born is a half human half deagon
The minute the sheep busted through the window I yelled "WILD SHEEP CHASE! Such a fun campaign 😂
"Everyone I've ever met absolutely loves it"... Dang... I am jealous... I never got to meet anyone in real life to play RPG with... (┬┬﹏┬┬)
Hey. Just watched James’ video released the same day. Wanna give some energy to you too since he showed me your channel. You got awesome animations and fun stories. I also love that slight awkward thing you do. Really adds to your uniqueness on YouTube. Keep up the awesome videos! ✌️N ❤
Dude, you were listing off the players and dungeon master, and then I realized, oh, wait, I like all of these youtubers.
Why does Paul remind me of Larry from Pokémon scarlet/violet
god this is the kinda channel i was looking for 😭
More
I've had some pretty gloriously unhinged sessions before, but this was orders of magnitude higher level
Girl I never got to play D&D to 😢
I love the part where the worm said “it’s worming time” and wormed all over the place
Have you been watching adventure time recently?
I love dnd and I ask you for me to play with you thank you for reading this
Bonk
this makes my sickness…   it doesn’t help but it made me happy
In my dnd game my friend seduced and fucked a door as a cockroach
LARRY IS THAT YOU?!
Why was alpharad just nanami from jujutsu kaisen.
11:17 "An invisible force they can't see" Ah yes I can see invisible forces.
Wait your mace has a pepper spray function?
Can i please have the music at 3:21
I see we have a cameo from the members of Vox Machina. Neat.
PLEASE DO MORE
Oh shit, this is based on a Wild Sheep's Chase, I love that oneshot, highly recommend it for new DMs to run.
Man I wish I had as good of a time with DnD...
"Paul" oh and "Paul Jr. Senior" and "Paul Jr Jr" most creative names of all time
I want to play my brother has played it but I thought it was to complicated and had math I am bad at math
Pleeeeeeeeeaaaaaase watch Doobus Goobus animations of Winnie the Pooh
YOUR MY PERSONAL HELL!  Is just sick
that was an awesome campaign. when can I join? It looks a lot of fun.
NAH BUT THAT PLOT TWIST ACTUALLY HAD MY JAW DROPPING???? I Also love Alpha’s “You’re fired” line for no reason- it’s so badass 😭
when i heard slimecicle and ranboo was in this session i flipped and got way too excited :D
Do a part2😆
I assume that ranboo is a bard, jaiden is a sorcerer or wizard, and Paul is an employee
Im sorry, was the character's name Zoot or Xooq, cuz Xooq is my gaming name haha
this was beautiful and chaotic and I need another session 🤣
I would love to see more!
I absolutely loved this! As someone whose first character was absolute chaos ( a halfling arcane trickster rogue with kleptomania and ADHD) I had a blast watching this. I hope you have just as much fun playing again as you did with this session.
We need more videos like these
The Vox Machina Easter Egg was so damn good ( ⚈̥̥̥̥̥́⌢⚈̥̥̥̥̥̀)❤
I want part two!!
Oh my gosh I just finished rewatching Over the Garden Wall and I am THRILLED with the references in the animation here, like the Beast in the forest and Greg, Wirt and freaking Jason Funderberker in the name creation screen
Paul reminds me of Larry from scarlet and violet
I was a light-foot halfling bard in my dnd group last year, and the scene I remember most vividly was the one that ended the current storyline. [We had been captured by the old mages son (a powerful wizard who I may or may not have seduced and inevitably fallen in love with) and were in the midst of fighting our way out.]  Tw: blood, death, violence to a moderate amount but it's DND so like what's a good last session without a battle to end it? The wizard, Marthalamule(idk if I spelled that right but idrc) had dozens of soldiers fighting me and my party, composed of a robot, an orc, a lost princess with magic hands, and a random rabbit. We had stolen weapons, and as we were fighting our way out, I saw him. Mathalamule. I had singled him out deliberately, and he smirked. "You were just so easy to fool, little halfling." H said smugly. He walked over and looked down on me.  "Oh, was I now? Last I checked it was you who let me into your home, and into your-"  He interrupted me with a scowl. "Last I checked, I have YOU cornered. A fight your party cant win, and you and your petty guild of thieves cant stop it. Zero is DEAD, and YOU are the one thing standing in my way from taking over the one piece I need to rule the world."  I scoffed. "And you think I dont have another person waiting to take over? You think they would ever, EVER listen to you?" I spat. "Come on, i know you're pretty, but you really should think more." I smiled despite what was going on, and I saw a flash of something like guilt in his eyes. I cast charm person(nat 20 + 5 charisma), and watched his face cloud over. He fumbled for words. I beckoned him down, and he got on his knees to be on my level.  "It doesn't have to be this way."  He said, emotion burning in his gaze. "Tell them to stop fighting, and I will take you to the top of the world with me. You and I can do this together." I sighed, knowing knew he cared for me before this; all it did was amplify the clouding of his senses.  "It did. And it has to end here." I said softly. Tears welled in my eyes as I hugged him. He embraced it gently, hugging me back with a loving expression. The fight around us began to slow, and my party members watched me in shock. I let go and cupped my hand around one of his checks, cradling his face and leaning to him as if I were to kiss him. His eyes closed, and I silently brought the dagger I had hidden in my cloak to his throat, slitting it as our lips almost touched. His face fell back, a look of shame, despair, betrayal, and knowledge crossing his face for nothing more than a second as he collapsed, dead. Covered in his blood and my own tears, I wept for him. The soldiers seemed to scatter like ants away, and my party stood silently as I sobbed. ~{And that was when our last session ended}~ I genuinely cried at this even though him dying was my decision and my idea but this stuck out because it was so dramatic (welcome to highschool DND people 🥲)
9:50 WAS THAT A ADVENTURE TIME REFERENCE
Lol I love the Larry reference
I love the disintegrating emoji reference
Why did that end part nearly make me cry
You can tell Charlie was the dm from the level of craziness in the campaign
Even if the Dungeon Master wants to coddle you and care for you, it will be a painful (in a fun and good way) experience. Mmmmmmm dnd is my fave game fr fr
why does paul look like larry from scarlet and violet 🤣
WHAT ABOUT THE TURTLE PAUL JR THE 2ND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
when you first said you reached out to Charlie I thought you meant moist critikal
I love the little Vox machina characters at 1:15 such a neat little reference  🔥
Paul JR! That was a epic story.
8:23 It’s morbin time!
wait what happened to the turtle
Do it again
casually leaving out the devil, the human bird, and the wand stealing
Wooow, this is soo cool! I want to play D&D too
ICE KING NOOO
The Vox Machima easter egg was a nice touch at the start :p
Great job at compressing a 4 hour session into sub-20 minutes!
dow anger d.a.d game
Bro why Jake/Paul kinda look like an old Draco Malfoy-
I always love seeing DND storirs, it's always really funny ! XD
Am I the only one who doesn't have friends who would play with you but still wants to play?
love the video ❤
best rp game eva
In the beginning of the video I was like "Yes, Finally, I have someone to relate to with the lack of playing DnD before!" Then the rest of the video was just them playing DnD for the first time. And now I want to cry bc I only have one other person I can play DnD with, no DM (Dungeon Master) and since I'm a kid and have to ask my parents for permission to play DnD with ppl, I haven't even told them "hey, I kinda want to play DnD one of these days" and they also aren't a huge fan of DnD either so um... imma probably have to wait till I'm in college for that 😢
SORRY WHAT. THE END WAS SOOOO ANTICLIMACTIC
WE MUST HAVE MORE!! MOREEEEEE
The tale of 2 furries and a business man
Hay one time I was making a video then my friend asked me if I was doing a video and looked then he asked again
omg vox machina,,,
1:40 larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet real
the worm got me XD
This made me cringe a lot
4:26   Oh so that's what Olmec went on to do after legends of the hidden temple.
Love the little Vox mahona refrence in thé beginning
OMGGGG!! this was suck an amazing video! loved the sound effects too! will be looking foreword for the other dnd vid on your other account! love you Jaiden !!<3
As SOON as you said a sheep crashed through the window" I started cackling because I knew EXACTLY which adventure you were playing XD  Edit: Nevermind apparently multiple people have used the adventure hook "Sheep with speak with animals scroll who used to be human bursts into a tavern" and honestly I think thats even better
Great video it went go like this: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I Love DnD❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
I love this
THE VOX MACHiNA CHARACTERSSS WHERES VEXX
congrats on your first time playinng dnd
MAKE A SEPARATE CHANNEL AND PLAY DND MORE OFTEN ON THAT CHANNEL!!  (love ur channel btw💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜🖤💜)
I remember watched that close range acid attack on live stream. Ive never laughed so hard in my life.
Paul junior could have ended this whole run with the word "turtle"
Hi I love your  videos  l like D&D Ones tried to kill a ORK  and my friend  die because it failed to attack the ORK and fell on the axe he got up and I was surprised then he fell have a good day 😺
Anyone else notice the beast from Over the Garden Wall at 4:15?
You guys should also play Baldur's Gate 3!
Song at 8:14?
HOW DID IT TAKE YOU THIS LONG TO PLAY THIS AWESOME GAME!?
Yeah DnD DOES look fun but I have no friends so I can’t play it and the developers are absolute freaking scummy pieces of trash
I LOVE HOW RANBOO LOOKS
I loved it when the worm said "IT'S WORMMIN' TIME!" and got immediately annihilated by Zoot.
Aaah I just realized that at 1:15 it's Crit role. Amazing!
4:13 anyone notice my child..    FUECOCO
I love how ranboo's enemy is at first Tomas the Tomson
DEPRESSION
LARRY POKEMON REFERENCE
“It’s wormin time” Zoot’s clay worm 2023
There is one unrealistic thing in this video and it’s that Mark hasn’t dealt with depression before
Morgana and Larry is here?
yes
I'd just go bingus mode.
You need to play D&D again!!!!
Aww I love the little Vox Machina reference in the beginning 😭💜
RANBOOOOO
9:51 isn’t that the sheep from adventure time?
I agree with Charlie Slimecicle, this whole group was very unhinged. I don't know of Alpharad or Ranboo but I do know Slimecicle, and I must say, you somehow managed to voice act all the DM-spoken characters (primarily the Door) in a way that makes me feel "Yeah, that sounds like how Slimecicle would say it". Good job!  Also, of course, I must (as everyone else) mention that "And proceeds to Acid Blast him point blank from the mouth" is absolutely hilarious. But, something I particularly liked that not everyone is mentioning: DEPRESSION!! Hang on, you're telling me there's the possibility to just inflict enemies with Depression in DnD? YOU HAVE GIVEN ME TOO MUCH POWER!
Loved the Critical Role reference at 1:15 and the Over the Garden Wall references at 4:15 with the Beast and at 4:33 with the nicknames!!
The first time i played dnd, my party was faced with an issue, we had to steal someones corpse from a graveyard, but we couldnt get noticed, so i, naturally, proposed to concoct some form of sleeping serum from herbs, and knock people out with it, basically, i wholeheartedly, unintentionally wanted to chloroform the visitors of the cemetery, how fun!
Ranboo is a cat😂😂😂😂
That was sooooo coool 😆
From all what could have been she went with... Dragon lady. This is genius
I WISH I HAD DND FOR A FUNNY EXPERIENCE :)
This session gave me Enter the Gungeon vibes, a mix of things from everyfuckingwhere in a place that doesn't make any sense with things that make even less sense, there is the former employee tired of living, a talking sheep, a walking musical cat, and a dragonborn with no sense of remorse going into a hobbit house-like dungeon in the middle of nowhere with a door that transformed the working class into zebras and a final room with goddamn modern day dynamite and activation system If that isn't a fever dream idk what the hell is
I love D&D
me and my friends started playing a DnD in school and in the DnD im a samurai Fishman who has the highes carizma stat in the entyre group and is currently on death row for trying to escape prison and failing horribly
More DnD Storytime PLEASE!!
THAT WAS EPIC!!!!!
Ok I can't rlly relate thaaaat much - cuz y'know I have no friends.... - but ANYWAY I still can relate a bit because I always wanted to play this and you gave me the motivation to. So thank you.
As a D&D player and a QSMP fan I totally loved this! There are parts where you can tell people rolled really high or really low and they are hilarious! The animation really brought this to life, and Charlie DM’d a perfect starter game! More please?
dnd is one of the most fun experiences in my opinion im gonna take a moment from a campaign i was in. So we had just ran away from the capital of all the undead, and just when we think we are safe there whole army just pulled up on the village that we were going to get supplies from so we prepared defences for the town and at the start of the battle it was going are way but then our dm was like "you hear the casting of a spell of in the distance" and then when we look up he casted MEOTER SWARM a ninth level spell keep in mind we are like level 13, then our ranger goes and with all his might splits one into splinters then he wild magic surges which gives him and the SORCERER A LONG REST which the sorcerer then goes and twin casts bigsbys hand and grabs one of the meteors and throw it at the undead caster. Then the druid which had just gotten three wishes told the other casters to enlarge reduce enlarge the meteor by 4 times and finnely she wished it to fall on the undead capital instead this was one of the best sessions i played in
Alpha is very intentionally Larry %100 on purpose, and I'm not surprised and very amused.
THIS IS SO COOL!!!!! I'm so glad you made a video from this. I hope you're able to play in a longer-form campaign, it's such a joy. I also hope this inspires more people to give D&D or other Tabletop RPG's (TTRPG's) a try! I was also super happy to see Vox Machina in the intro, my loveable goofs <33  Gosh the twists and turns and bits in this oneshot were amazing, love Paul so much lmfao
Ok, now play paranormal order
Rip Paul Jr. 4:17-17:06
This was amusome to watch, can't wait for future vids 😊
THIS IS THE COMBO I HAVD BEEN WAIT8NG FOR
the vox machina was amazing
I also started playing dnd recently!
I like that you use the mario & luigi rpg series theme
THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE 😂
0:33  ok just unsubbed
Got to respect that shadows of almia music at 12:27  Those four replays really show when I instantly know it's from there PS: it's 'cargo ship (oil field hideout)' if anyone wants to know
IM BEING SLANDERED AGAIN, FIRST IT WAS THE GUY WHO MADE A VIDEO ABOUT A GAME CALLED MARKY SPARKY WHICH HE DECIDED TO SLANDER ME AND MY FRIEND, GOD.
This video is mad lame
I think, that while he should not be using this for monetary gain, he should be allowed to live a normal life. Ex cons are almost completely outcast from our society, even when they serve their sentence. Yall are so quick to jump on the hate train, and it makes me so sad to see. He should not be allowed to garner a social platform, however he is more than allowed to live his life
Tbh I’d watch a series this
Dam. That sounded AWESOME!
15:14 everyone watching: …
No way! He just “Tobi”’s out of there!?
Nice video good
Nice! I play as a Dragonborn 99% of the time!
Im sorry but why does Alpharads character remind me of larry
I love D&D!
Ths was a perfectly timed video, I recently started playing again and have been having so much fun!
is this spoilers for wild sheep chase?
Jaden, Jay, just what some some slick ass pulled, made you sound like a problem, you're not, you're a good good you tube, why do you have to work at the desk typing on YouTube shorts, Jane being a pervert, this type dynamic life is saying, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry I will get you every
That sounds like it was fun.
That was so much fun
Ranbo
Yes! VERY GOOD! I love D & D!
I gottat say, if you asked me what Alpha, in his insane mental world, would choose to be in D&D, I never in a million years would have guessed Larry.
My favorite part about DnD is my right to question every life choice my mates make. Like, who would want to send a pet rock to steal the sheriff's pillow?
I loved listening to this as I lifeguarded during work though I got some weird looks from people when I started laughing!
THAT WAS AWESOME 😂❤❤
I play D&D at my school for an option and I have one of the best characters named zeus the god idk why I named it zeus the god but it has best stats I think it’s 19 for str and 18 for dex and 16 for intelligents and 17 for charisma and I think 16 for wisedom
Fam 🤣🤣🤣🤣 thi was great I did not see that once coming 🤣🤣
How would you play Skylanders that's a little fun
"this is for everything. the low tax return. the restraining order. for moving in next to me. YOU'RE MY PERSONAL HELL!!" dang ranboo's character is savage as hell
I just see her in Ted nivison video and i check in her and im suprise she's a 12m subs she's like competing with tommyinnit
ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE
Combining animation with people's DnD adventures has always been my favorite thing i'm loving this so much TwT
VOX MACHINA!!!!!!
I always pick the dragon and my GM hates it
Paul is relatable asf
Anyone else notice Paul is Larry from scarlet and violet but blonde I think that was a fun detail
ah yes a dragonborn a kittycat wal-mart man
...how many nat 1s did you guys roll???
So we have a furry with very loud drums, a dragon that shoots acid, Paul, and a sheep that may or may not also be Paul? Sounds like a fun campaign tbh
4:32 I just notice Jaiden character look like susie from deltarune
Casual vox machina in the tavern
Great content
WHY DOES PAUL LOOK LIKE LARRY FROM POKÉMON GEN 9???
i need more
JAYDEN ANIMATIONS VID OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
So nobody is going to talk about how zeute said “DEPRESSION” as a curse?-
Good
the luap part got me 💀
Thanks for Video.
Okay anybody else notice the reference for over the garden wall? 4:16
That vox machina cameo 👍 👍 👍
So I was playing D&D I took a skeleton skull, and then it got up, and then we killed it. Then one of my other members took its rims, and then two more came, and we took those out, but then I took another one to skull. and then for World up and then I got knocked out
Of course, the classic trio. Furry, Furry, and Assistant Manager
WHEEEEYYYYY JAIDEN PLAYED DND
Yoshikage Kira:]
RANBOO?
Israel killed 800 human in a hospital  70% were childrens
I would legitimately watch a series of animated videos just about you D & D sessions. (if you have any more)
I would love it if this turned into a little series like the Pokémon videos. This was AMAZING
This was just a whole new tier in the ever growing and always beyond satisfying videos you produce. The quality is just miles passed outstanding.
DnD is truly wacky at times, and Jaiden has shown why. But once you enter HOMEBREW territory... it can reach asinine levels of insanity. 2 examples of my homebrew experiances were.  1: "Most of us can't see, we don't have darkvision. Cast us a lightsource" (Proceeds to summon the sun inside a large cave dungeon... everything takes fire damage) 2: "We're out of catapult ammo and the evil wizard is gloating and preparing to leave" (looks at dead Golem teammate) "He said to always be practical for everything" (Nat 20 catapults the Golem's body at the wizard and kills him... POST MORTEM)
OMG Vox Machina as randon NPCs is so cute!
Kira Yoshikage is my favourite character
Great vedio
Not seeing nearly enough people pointing out the sheer briliance of Jaiden inventing Power Word; DEPRESSION- 14:07 Had me rolling i swear
sweet. i was right
6:15 a worm, earthworm i think.
The video was still great tho.
Why do I have a hunch that you copied the style of James's video "Boys Night"?(Just a joke I am not angry or criticizing or anything. I am not evil.)
A coworker of mine retold an entire campaign he participated in. He told with such passion I felt like I was there. Ever since then I’ve been curious about the game. I think I’d want to watch a couple games first though
I just got a 🐢
THE BEAST FROM OVER THE GARDEN WALL
Only people who have played Pokemon scarlet and violet know who alpha was trying to play
A disgruntled Wallmart middle management employee as a Barbarian is brilliant.
1:16 Vox Machia
Sue looks like they would enjoy patha with no thauce
I tried to seduce a oger
Wild Sheep Chase?!!
I watched slime react to this and I loved it, the idea of just shouting depression as a spell to make him depressed is amazing
I didn't hear a single fus ro dah. This is wack!
16:09 AVADA KEDAVRA
The part were he "acid blasted him point blank from the mouth" got me laughing cause i thought you were about to kick the no no area
Jaiden is the type of person to roll a nat 20 and still lose
Well now this makes me want to play dnd 😭
ive never played dnd, and idk wtf is going on and yet i love it
I never realized how well Mario music fits so well with DND.
Was Bartholomew stuck in a time loop or was he lying???
3.2 MILLION views and this video is only 5 DAYS OLD?! Ok @JaidenAnimations you have so much power now that you have not just my respect but perhaps my FEAR
WE NEED TO HAVE MORE OF THIS! IT WAS HILARIOUS AND I LOVED IT!
Love the adventure time refrences at 9:51 and At 10:21
"DEPRESSION"
If anyone is wondering, the Draconic on the spell scroll actually reads, "Speak with animals." Nice attention to details!
My favourite part was when he said “Its worming time.” And wormed all over them
I saw 4 Iconic People!
Where can I find this full thing?? This is amazing!!❤
I NEED MORE DND
Hey, consider having actual captions instead of autogenerated ones.
Every d&d has a moment of love and revenge
Susie deltarune
What a story! My favorite parts include the turtles and the mini violin 😁
WAIT. WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT BEFORE. IVE SEEN ANOTHER. WHERE SOMEONE SHAPESHIFTS INTO SOMEONES WIFE. AND THEN COMFORTS THEM. THEN KILLS THEM WITH ACID. WHERE. WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT.
I am going to reuse this campaign and no one will stop me
That was hilarious I hope you also make your next session
Me and my friends had the funniest DND story’s one time I was a sexy anime pickle
3:42 it says lop in the subtitles
is this the animated version of the thing in the subathon? IT IS!!!
The music/song at the end, 16:30, is...  Boo Night Fever from Paper Mario: Sticker Star  Thanks goes to @Krialls
15:28 is funny
Lol i just started my first campaign yesterday
i can't believe alpharad just played as larry for an entire campaign
Depression... WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN!
I always loved the animated d&d just because of the story and unpredictable things that could happen🙂
jaden really went hard for that emotional damage like damn. XD
wild
jaiden giving a guy depression by shouting DEPRESSION was like the lich going "f a l l" and instantly knocking finn out
I guess I'm not alone with this situation. I never had any interest in playing D&D growing up, and didn't care for it at all. That is, until one of my work friends recently invited me to join a campaign along with a few others. We've only done a few sessions so far, but it's been fun. My character is a Kashrishi (a rhino-person) who is an earth kineticist (basically an earthbender) and an aspiring chef.  For anyone interested, our initial campaign was being hired by our DM's character to search for a highly toxic plant in order to use it to make a type of cure-all potion. Our first main encounter was a sorcerer and his garden of walking pitcher plants. Then after running into and subsequently befriending a wild owlbear (mainly through offering it food), we ran into a traveling demonic circus. Sure they appear a bit shifty, sure some of them have non-demon body parts sewed onto them, and sure they seem to have an ill-known bounty hunter among their ranks, but they're not outwardly antagonistic. So we interact with them for a while, until a scream is heard. We find that the scream came from a boy who was attacked by a monster with 10 heads and 20 arms. After treating the boy's wounds, we learn that the circus has been dealing with this "unkillable demon" for at least 10 years, probably closer to 18. It's said to be unkillable because it can only be killed in the dimensional plane it originated from, from which it was banished long ago. That being said, our party decides to hunt it in order to at least subdue it. We set out to the surrounding forest it fled to, and eventually encounter the demon that (according to the DM) closely resembles a false hydra. After a tough battle, I ended up dealing the final blow, somehow with a critical hit (beginner's luck, I'm sure). For the finisher, I slammed my hands into the ground, creating several 'precipice blades' that sliced off the demon's remaining heads and skewered the body. Then I commanded the stone to form around the body, acting like a prison, hoping that it would increase the amount of time it stays down. Afterwards, the circus thanks us for dealing with the demon, they're promised to be a recurring ally, and they give us directions to the next town.   Long story short, I definitely see why D&D can be very enjoyable now, and I'll be eagerly waiting for the next session.
ive watched this like 5 times now
my school (luckly) has a d&d club, and the teacher that hosts this club helped me make my first character which is a plasmoid (lil goo guy) and somehow has goated stats. it’s best skill is it’s stealth, which is a +7.
I like the idea of dnd, and I’d love to play. Hell I even love story writing and story telling, BUT IM LAZY AND BAD AT MATH
I played dnd today and two of my friends spent a half hour grave robbing. They only did one bc one of them rolled a nat 1 when opening the coffin and managed to bury it back up. Just wanted to share that (:
My god, I just beat the tomb of souls, it is about the best-worst boss ever, Dam
Jaiden as a dragon has to be one of the cutest things ive ever seen, LOOK AT THEM BIG EYES
1:10 no one is talking about vox machina making an appearance
Paul would defo say “I miss my wife tails”
One of my favorite videos hope to see more
I half expected Alpharad to start with “My name is Yoshikage Kira”
The Vox Machina reference I love it
love the way you drew charlie. you perfectly captured his anime villain flair
Answer me these riddles three then thy shall pass through me. Perfect ryme
This is just a story basically
Is Mr President for Jojo’s bizarre adventure
Guys please it's killing me, what's the outro song?!?!
you know most people end up eloping with ogres anyways
I just realized Alphard is larry
Nice enjoying video 👍
DnD looks like a weird trip and i still don't know how to "play" but it was kinda cool
No way did you animate in vox machines
YOU PLAYED DND WITH SLIMECICLE?!?!? @Slimecicle I wanna play 🥺
God I need to watch a full thing of them
cat person should’ve named their character ikea
Using the king de de de boss fight music made this 10x better
Is Jacob just Larry
command: depression is such a power move
Does anyone know what charlie slimecicle uses for his dnd sessions? Im setting one up for my friends and im the dungeon master and want to know what it is and if it's any good :33
love the adventure tie derpy horse refrence
Don’t think we didn’t notice the Vox Machina reference at 1:16
As a former worker of Ye Old Mart of Wall, I greatly enjoyed this story.
I’ve never felt so much like I’m on acid and crack in my life
Nice background music choices
Ok that was so iconic
What fun! Would love to see more someday.
My first time playing dnd was me being in a coma while my teammates are trying to fight an overpowered raccoon, but one of them almost died, and the other lost their frog in battle😂
Rahn boo?
the fact that Paul has insanely deep lore but in the end marks reaction is just "and you... Paul...anyways" is hilarious
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Love the Critical Roll inclusion      When we first enter the Old Oak Inn we see a Winged NPC (forget the race) and zoom out to see Kelith talking to Vax with Pike and Grog drinking all sitting at the same table at about 1:13
Alpha is just Larry from Pokémon
I love how jaden just try’s to murder mark at the saddest moment
My dnd campaign has involved my friends being pirates, burning down two ships, getting kidnapped, and then V1 from ULTRAKILL starts punching the guards and a 7 foot tall orc crushes their heads while one of our party members sang "my favorite things"
I think it should’ve been Mr. president
god dang it you flipin beat me and my friends to it as i myself just played yesterday it was super fun.
Alpha was Larry and it’s funny
Hey is there a full video j have to watch it
tehn outta THEN videooooOooo
Watching this felt like a fever dream, I love it, do it again
10:40
You guys are so creative! These characters may be unhinged, but that’s what makes them so unique and hilarious.
I’ve been wanting to try dnd too and seeing the fun you had just makes me want to try more  Also if anyone wants a good dnd podcast to listen too a good one I’ve been listening to is “tales from the stinky dragon” it’s longer but chill and funny.
👍🏻
More. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
Why alpharads character remind me of Larry from gen 9
Never cried so hard from laughing! Glad you had fun!
best video i ever wached 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🙂
Yo
Getting flashbacks from adventure time when he said glob
Vox machina cameo Vox machina cameo
VOXMICANA
Shout out to members of Vox Machina for making a cameo 😂
Did anyone else notice the Vox Machina easter egg in the tree Inn?
He rolled a nat 1
Sup-
The legend of Vox Machina!?❤
I LOVE THIS OMG
Goofy ahh
Legit didn't even put it together that Luap could be Paul jr and I audibly gasped when he turned back- then again I'm dumb
I want to try
I love this
Speaking of DND my dad spent $200 on a DND board and bought it before mom said we couldn’t afford it, the moral of the story, don’t spend over $75 on a board game especially in a house like mine where everything gets lost, like how we lost a basketball hoop, you won’t know until it’s too late
It's wormin time XD
i could feel the nat 1s that were rolled lmao 👏💯
This was soo fun!
Paul's dad is Larry
Nice, my first game started with me getting blackout drunk
Me: *Starts to get into D&D* Jaiden: *Posts D&D video* Me: UHH WHAT, MIND READER?!
Apharad character is definitely based on Larry the pokemon leader Larry .
being a walmart worker i dont blame him for turning evil
I can't believe I missed the Beep Beep I'm A Sheep reference at 9:30 the first time i watched this vid
Please do more!!!
I’ve never played dnd, always wanted to, now I want to more. Hilarious.
Wait… why didn’t you just do a “triple or nothing” round with the bronze door to turn Luap back to normal
First the critical role reference, and then Paul just being Larry from pokemon. I could already tell this would be a good video
It seems like an incredible amount of natural 1s were rolled in that session
Day 1 of asking you to make another part of this
I LOVE THE VOX MACHINA EASTER EGG !!!
This was short, but it seemed like a fun and pleasant adventure. I've never played D&D myself, but always wanted to learn more about it. I thought that D&D had to be serious with moments of humor, but with this story in mind, I wouldn't mind it being short, a bit goofy or sweet like this was. Thanks for sharing this story and I wish you well Jaiden.
SEQUAL!!
My friend once seduced a dragon… and then my other friend did some stuff with a spider.
tf did charlie do to my beautiful roll playing gamer
this was amazing i also loved the vox machina reference. I wish i could have sat in on this d&d session it seems amazing
What a nice tree 4:11
D&D
I was unsubscribed from the channel I only noticed that this video was up because of a Nux reaction, wth YouTube?
moral of the story, don't be Paul
I LOVED THIS SO MUCH I CANT WAIT TO SEE IF THERE IS GONNA BE A SESSION 2
Dudeeeeeeee el backflipooooooooooooo!!! @slimecicle
IT`S WORMIN TIME
Bro acid😂😂😂😂😂
Can you guys DUNGEONS & DRAGONS again
Ella…. Is that you?
I played as a dungeon master ONCE and this one guy only rolled 1s
Bro dose enyonenelse looks at jaidens characters and dose remind you of Susie from the game deltarune
Vox machina reference?
Loved this one
Once you play you suddenly want to have dice-
Bro the goblins were cooking the adventure time horse
I wanna make a bonsai designed like that oak tree tavern.
Support the team is so adorable omagaaaa
I'm not even a minute in...but I know Jacob immediately did some goon stuff, because that's just how he is, and I love him for that. Never before in my life did I think I would hear someone refer to throwing a character or creature as "So long Gay Bowser's the ____" and tbh I thank you for changing that Edit: I unpaused and 3 seconds after I see Jacob's lil dude turn into Larry from Pokemon S/V god damnit, Jacob, also adore the Vox Machina reference Edit 2: ADVENTURE ZONE REFERENCE SPOTTED, RAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
I love how we can easily tell what's a nat 20 and what's a 1 lol all the epic fails
Can we please, Please, PLEASE get more nuzlockes? I love those videos with those videos!
THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME?!?!
Do you know I hated you for a second but it was kind of funny just acid blast I mean a little messed up but like I really like it please do more      *Frozen magic dagger* Use it in the next Maybe if you want
Also VOX MACHINA! THEY ARE THERE!
Yo new Jaiden video that's a W if I have if I have heard noice 😁😁😁💪👌
This was halarious! Jaiden istg you are litterly the reason why I am going into animation this year in college. D&D makes me wanna create a character sheet now lol
of course mr charlie slimecicle is the dm
I love the amount of care and love is put into each of your videos nowadays regardless the wait. You never disappoint. By the way I am a big fan of your channel and how you went from a story time channel to a Gamimg/Animated gaming experience channel. Basically a whole new category which I love. Keep up the good work, and hope your getting payed lots of mula💰😄
The nod to vox machina 👏👏 well played
My daughter - huge fan by the way- played her first campaign about a year ago. In her first campaign, she befriended a gelatinous cube (named Slimey) to whom she was psychicly linked. He became her pet and did her bidding. In the big boss battle, she ripped the  partially digested bone of an enemy from Slimey and used it to beat another enemy senseless.
I love the Vox machina reference at 1:16
WHY IS JACOB LARRY FROM POKEMON GEN 9
wait was the door hamnations
Is Zoot enby?
I had my first time playing dnd recently as well
1:13 AYO VOX MACHINA!? let's goooooooooo
This feels like something from Doug Doug
paul = larry
Ooooh I've ran this module before! It's such a great one shot.
By the way, @jaidenanimations, I'm curious about Zoop's backstory, but it wasn't revealed at all in this video. I tend to write...A LOT for my character's backstories, because I cant help it (I'm very detail oriented, lol.)
4:15 fear the beast and leave these woods if you can  oh hey a black turtle    4:33 oh my garden wall no way
9:51 Why does that horse look like the one from Adventure Time?
Ok so THIS is what dnd is. Apperantly my group is just violent because I played for the first time the other day and we killed two guards, stabbed a guy in the groin, and slammed a goblin into a tree. Note this was all on them I tried to scurry up a tree despite being a 7 foot tall half orc.
OK if anybody thinks thats mushy please tell me now
I just wanted to tell you something you are doing great and do not let other people pull you down just because of something that they didn’t like all right I know I’m just like some random guy on the Internet please I want you to know don’t let anybody pull you down it’s you that matters😊
IS PAUL LARRY FROM POKEMON SCARLET AND VIOLET?????
Ive never played d&d but ik ill hate it bc im not creative enoguh for that
3:40 plot twist it’s the kid
TURTLE FINAL ANS— ITS A WORM
Same 0:14
Great video as usual Jayden. But the use of gender-neutral pronouns is cringe. Seriously, what's so bad about saying he and she?
No
dnd go bRrrrrrRr  DND is fricking awesome <3
This video was uploaded the same day my dad started a new session
I saw the vid name and just like OH NO THIS WILL BE AMAZING XD. also yesss Dragonborns for life!!
nice Vox Machina cameo
I love how you put in references to over the garden wall and adventure time.
10:04 yoo is that the horse from adventure time
The guy who married the ogre must’ve been a bard 😂
Top ten acting
Ranboos cat is sooo cute
Yo. Its s good day when  jaydon post
Depression 14:07
STOP MAKING ME DIE LAUGHING ME IN CLASSS
HAHAHA i saw that acid blast coming!
this was awesome! personally never been a big d and d fan, but after seeing this i can say i am a fan of it now!
i love that my fellow slime dmed for you guys
“DEPRESSION⁉️⁉️⁉️‼️‼️‼️‼️❓❓‼️‼️‼️‼️🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅»
that command depression is probably the cruelest thing I've seen in dnd XD. Definitely taking notes
Can I join please?
9:54 ADVENTURE TIME REFERENCE!
IT'S WILD SHEEP CHASE LET'S GOOOO. The twist! I GASPED.
How do you peel an axe? Ask The Peeler.
LOL!  Thankee!  Alleluia!
You seem like the person who wasn’t a band kid but had the heart of a band kid so you were basically adopted by the band kids this is coming from a band kid so I would have adopted you easily
the mario and luigi music fit pretty well (specially the iconic song playing when paul and (this is probably misspelled but eh) thalamew do a team attack
Oh thats sick as fuck
Stares at tree, that tree is, a tree yep.
That vox machina reference though...
Why does Paul look like Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet
SHOOT MY NAME
Wow this goes to show you how fun and interesting dnd can be with creative minds! I havent played much and want to play more, but all my experiences have been quite tame compared to this. Thanks for the animated adaptation 😁😁😁
Emotional moment Proceeds to point blank acid blast him
4:51 the german drums🤣
1:16 vox machina!
Vox machina reference babyyyyyyy
Wargroove music hits different
That was a good vid actually  "and the blasts acid point blank form his mouth"   That was the best part
If u love it, I’ll reconsider your channel
Yes
Holy shit, the villain name twist was so stupid but so funny, I hate it.
Hold up, is that Grog, Pike, Keelith and Vax?
love the immediate vox machina reference
This was beautiful. I love how you can tell every time something/someone critically failed; it’s wonderful.
I’ve never played, but I want to play DND so bad man.
Alpha Larry (Paul) is something I didn’t know I needed but it’s absolutely feckin perfect
OH MY GOD I SAW THE BEAST FROM OTGW IN THERE
tHE PLOT YWISTS CAUGHT ME SO OFF GUARD YHIS IS SO FUNNY
Rampage
Coconut mall is the perfect music for the sheep rampag
I greatly enjoy the super mario and luigi superstar saga music playing when they do their tag team. I see you
que legal kk queria jogar com alguns amigos mas nos literalmente somos três criaturas antissociais, um dia eu tomo coragem pra jogar kkkk
Pulled an alucard
Ohhhh i had in mind Mark-iplier jajajaja
Love the characters all so so much!
i am about 4 days late to say this but i am first
This is such an awesome video!! I am huge fan of these videos!! Keep up the good work!
THERE BETTER BE MORE SESSIONS I WANNA SEE A WHOLE CAMPAIGN
Anybody knows the Nintendo songs she uses
llewop is the last name i typically give my player characters
Dnd Is the most fun and out of context game you can play. Like you can be a Teifling with split personalities or Dragonborn with voices in his head. Or just something normal.
Love the vox machina cameo in the beginning
15:22  Just to look into marks eyes, sparkling with tears…  AND PROCEEDS TO ACID BLAST HIM POINT BLANK FROM THE MOUTH!
for the jojo fan  pual is just kira but deppresd
my first time playing D&D was really uneventful and kind of bad due to one of the players but it did have the memorable moment of me rolling a 1 when i tried to throw a dagger which through a series of other rolls lead to me hitting an ally in the back of the head and nearly killing them
LETS GOOOOOOOO
I'm hoping we can get more D&D, great work on the video!
This is unhinged.
Please do more of these. That was great
I didn’t notice vox macina at the start
This felt like it was written by AI😭
Paul gives me heavy Isekai vibes. Like, a person who really does NOT fit into an RPG-esque world at all, who's just thrown in there, modern suit and all? (-᷅_-᷄๑) Yeah, he was probably some japanese office worker who got reincarnated who changed his name.
Nice touch using mario and luigis game ost
Anyone else think that Alpharad based his character off of Larry, or is it just the art that Jaiden did that gives that impression.
This is my second favourite animated video about D&D characters entering a cave to find short troll people. The first can't be found on YouTube. Ifkyk
I love how Alpharad is literally just Larry
Damn Mario&Luigi Superstar Saga has amazing tracks for ambience.
That was so fun! I loved it !
GOD THE DELIVERY ON "YOU'RE MY PERSONAL HELL" WAS BONE CHILLING
I was already thinking about trying this at school because there is a D&D club. Now i'm hooked and will for sure try it sometime!
A quote from a DM at a convention that ran a game my friends and I played in “I have never seen this many ones and twenties at a table in my life.” And “Everyone knows greater spiders cast magic.”
damn i wish i can experience this too bad i havent met someone who knows dnd here in the philippines
"Living as a normal worm now" then proceeds to strangle around a dragons neck, don't know what worms Jaiden is looking at but I don't wanna meet em.
Why is alpharad a mix of the normal type gym leader in pokemon scarlet and violet... and kira yoshikage?
"would you still let me be your manager if I was a worm"
I want to see more of these!
I liked the Adventure Time references!
What a plost twist
yo I love this video u should make more dnd videos
Missed you jaiden!!!!! I love your videos all day everyday!!
9:51 Oh no! Not the Adventure Time horse!
Good now play Warhammer 40K
Can I play to
Hello
i love this so much it is the most fun thing i’ve seen. Dnd stories are always my absolute favorite and these characters are hilarious
This is such an awesome video!!
My favorite video of you is Frozen Yogurt Freakout..
how did i not notice the Vox Machina gang on first watch lmao
they ate the ice kings costumes
Ever tried almost causing a tpk first session and almost killed everyone in one turn.
Which dungeons & dragons game did you get
If Jaiden doesn’t get you interested in playing then nothing will. ….Anyone up for a game?
Ive only played dnd once. As in one session and nothing else. It was going well, the dungeon master printed out ai generated jpegs of each character (4 in total) and my character ended being a girl by accident, so the story plays out and I a warlock ended up spawning on top of the tavern we were at. One of my friend tries and fails to impress the bartender by performing a “Trikle Backflip” so he’s kicked out. Then bandits show up and asks my friend who was in the tavern to come out so they can mug her (wanted to play a girl). They try to convince the bandits that all of their belongings is on the dude who got kicked out for performing a “trikle backflip” and they don’t believe them. Meanwhile I’m watching on the roof of the tavern and my other friend is just buying alcohol during this mess for a future session that will never be. Then even though my friend who tried and failed already to convince the bandits that his belongings were on someone else, he double downs and tries to convince the bandits that the random person on the roof had all of his belongings, which successfully happens. Now that most of the bandits after me now the one who called me out puts some distance on the bandits while the other one is trying to convince the bartender to unban him by doing “Trikle Backflips” and the other one is now just fighting outside. The session ends with the guy who sold me out taking little to no damage, the one buying alcohol leaving because of work, the dude finally impressing the bartender to unban him by performing the most perfect “trikle backflip”, some guards who practically rescued us and ultimately defeated the bandits and me almost dead after trying to replicate the awesome “trikle backflip” down the tavern, resulting in me landing on my face.
I have never played or heard of D&D this video, it would be cool if one day I could try it                                                I wonder how many sci-fi things I can have? 🤔
seeing vox machina in the intro was a fun little easter egg
what did I miss  cuz I don’t play dungeons and dragon and due to my brain being a jerk cuz it is what it is
This could be an awesome audio book
MORE
What happened to ari?
omg I rlly want another dnd video this was so fun to watch
I've done a DND where me and my friends were a family of criminals - I was an assasin mage, someone else was a half elf assasin, someone else was completely insane and addicted to benadryls named (I am not joking) - I'm Crazy, and there was another shapshifting criminal, and our bloodthirsty mafia grandma, who definitely did not kill the parents who mysteriously disappeared, and who blackmailed and gaslit her grandchildren into attacking her mafia rival, ending with an assault on a giant metal fortress
MORE
Is it just me or did the character selection process and specifically design of jaidens character design remind anyone else of susie from deltarune
Loved the vox machina reference at the start
I love dedede theme
I love it so much the  story was great
No one can't convince me that paul give off nanami
0:32 why the actual f--- was i unsubbed. oh right this is a new account for yt
Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
kay
9:51 it's the fake horse from Adventure
interesting
Jaiden’s fursona lmao 😂 💜
"hey um are you two new here? "born and raised!" "i wish i was" 10/10 incredible character lines
Ok I just want everyone to take a moment (go on, actually take it... there you go) to appreciate the fact that in her narration, Jaiden PERFECTLY imitated Ranboo's EXACT speech pattern. MAD respect.
14:09 HELP?
Paul gives me Larry(Pokemon scarlet & violet) vibes
Wow. A Critical Role, and a JoJo reference in the span of like 3 minutes. How fun.
You should watch the amazing digital circus
Good description of the DM.
In my last game we committed the cardinal sin of splitting the party and when the party reunited the 6 princes had been turned into swans and we had to flee the castle on horseback. My paladin has speak with animals and all the swans just turned to stare at him
Jaiden i really like your videos i hope i can meet you someday
Missed opportunity to call the wife "Karen" like one day Karen asked for the manager and they accidentally fell in love and got married
Just capture barely edited recording of the sessions. I bet people will love to watch whole games and bullshit that ensues from it... also there needs to be alphabet agency in style of SCP foundation trying contain this group of misfits and unhinged individuals in style of team rocket, since containing this disaster is not possible.
If only I had friends that wanted to play this game too 😭 because this sounded so fun
If u think this was crazy watch the Doug Doug dnd stream
If thomul was stuck in the same day over and over again then how did something new
can you do a Pokémon infinite fusions nuzlock
This was madness! (and an emotional rollercoaster at that)
CANT BELIVE THAT JAIDEN CALLED RAMBO AND CHARLIE!
great vdeo
We need this disclaimer: During this game no underage sentient creature was hurt by the PCs.
15:28 please tell me that you had to roll 20 to do this 😂
4:13 Fueccoco, Pikachu and Ari are in this scene which is very creepy and weird
Slimecicle is the type of person to say that their fav food is _corn_ if you know what I mean
Love the Over the Garden reference at 4:15
THE DEPRESSION SPELL GOT ME 💀💀💀
He kinda reminded me of kira yoshikage
Half way into the Video and the Phrase: Dont Listen to him he is a zebra killed me hahaha
jaiden i have a better question which one is ur second channel u hv 3 and 2 of them ur almost equally active
Yes yes yes yes
MORE DND CONTENT
14:43 to 15:40 was so much more brutal in the session stream, this animation makes it funny too but if you watch their session you know its so much more funnier
NERD
No way Jaiden drew me 10:56
Is alfarade larry
DO ANOTHER
Slay ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ l love you ❤❤
D&D is the best
I'm so glad your first experience of D&D was a fun one! 😊 This video is amazing! 😍 You did a great job animating this campaign!
Tholomew: literal scaredy-cat  Zoot: unhinged golden retriever in the body of a Dragonborn  Paul: axe wielding depressed widower, and the only one with sense  Luap: living plot twist  Paul jr: TURTLE
15:29 got me rolling
Why is Alphared's character looking like a reference to Larry (Pokemon scarlet + Violet) and the only human character of the three🤭
Did we just gradually moved on
WE'RE NEED A 2ED PART>:)
amazing ^^ just amazing ^^
Need more stuff like this 😂😂
This is awesome! :D
I NEED MORE OF THIS
Just to let you know the bagpipes needed two more pipes
I think it would be awesome for a series of DND sessions.
Anyone else catch the easter egg at the start?? VM making a cameo!
Turtle! Final answ..  Amazing 😂 10/10
This is amazing, perfect first DND experiance
My friend told me that his DND master had a group that burnt down the starting village, which should be impossible by his rules. They lured a slime into the village, and they gave it some sort of plant, and it burst it into flames, burning the village.
Zoot lol
6:48 racist! :P
Goblins eating the horse from adventure time
Depression is an amazing command!
the Vox Machina cameo at the start is so cool lol i love this video already and i just started watching it
An animated d&d session!? YES!
We had a Dnd session where the guards caught us in the main bad guy castle, we said we were house keeping and proceeded to montages clean around the castle trying to find the hostages (nat 20 our decetion and nat 1 their insight) so it became our trade make when we kicked down doors we'd yell housekeeping
I really wanna play dnd but I don't have any friends to play dnd or anyone I know who could dm
Alpharad's character being depicted as Larry from SV is hilariously ironic considering his woeful misinterpretation of that game's storyline.
Ok
I like the board game "talizman" first edition
In dnd you imagine your having fun
Another great vedio
Fantastic. This rules.
Bruh making characters this likable should be a crime, Tholomewl was my fave, I'd gladly stick by him in any adventure. 😁🐱🎶
Def should make a weird out of this
I loved it! I want more of it!^^
:o
THE RIDDLE DOOR I AM SOBBING
I almost killed one of my party members with a fish
Im stealing the polymorphed but still conscious being with a speak with animals scroll 😭
15:31 should've done a german suplex
one thousand better than the movie with the owlbear! you´re the best!
the Vox machina reference!!!!
I love how Jacob is playing Larry
Zoot pulls back -just a bit-  just to look back into marks eyes… which are sparkling with tears.. and proceeds to acid blast him point blank from the mouth.
WHY DID THIS HAVE TO BE SO SAD
You are AWESOME. My friend introduced me to your channel with your “History on my Hair” video, and I have kept tabs on your stuff ever since! Your animation is amazing and you are one of the most creative animators/artists that I have ever seen!
Damn I would open a twitch account and watch this if they did it live, however It is a completely different experience doing stuff for fun and doing it with cameras
Oooou what's was that song again with the clay monsters
*bops in the corner, still knowing nothing about d&d*
Anyone know the name of the outro song?
What are all the classes, only the Bard was obvious to me 😅
Big up vox machina in the old oak inn
I love dnd I am a dragon born level 7
5:25 Holy crap I was right!? I just guessed that because the person was turned into a sheep.
IS THAT FUCKING LARRY
Can't believe Jaiden helps Mark get through depression and then proceeds to spit acid in his face
Thank For the Story Video 📖🙊🤯🥰😍😁💗👍👌💐🌟🥇🏆
This was without question the most unhinged inhumane group of total psycho characters I have ever DMed for. When are you free for session 2?
The heck
This was awesome!
THIS IS SO FUN OH MY GOODNESS
This is such a cool animation, great work Jaiden!
WE NEED MORE OF THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!😂
Try tpk by tarask
i need more of this!
are you going to create a dnd party meet up today sir I'd like a uuuuh bar  how original  in a inn  daring today aren't we
AMAZING!
I've played D&D many times and it's great
Holy heck the Vox Machina reference at the 1:15 mark?! Please tell me you’ve seen the show too, it’s amazing!
I loved the Vox Machina Easter eggs Jaiden
the masked dedede theme is giving me LIFEEEE
I loved that
LOL LOL DX 15:25
You should make a video on celecest
i would probably create a pathetic puddle of clay, cause all the characters i make are stupid
Ooooo, the BEAST is out there! 4:15
Hell yeah grog cameo 😂
Why did you say I love you to Rebeca Pairem 6 years ago
this is so random. i love it
1:13 HAHA I LOVE THESE REFERENCES
I love the vox machina reference lol
The first time I played dnd I was an ice dragonborn sent to kill another Dragonborn I froze him decapitated him and gave my contractor the head as proof
That was short but it was cool!
THIS WAS SO FUN TO WATCH AND MADE ME WANT TO PLAY D&D SO BADD I CAN'T WAIT TO START A CAMPAIN W/ MY FRIENDS!!!!! >:3
Bro this adventure was my first dnd thing too! I instantly recognised it from the sheep! My tortle died on the first encounter lmao
Love this
DO MORE DND OMG
i fudging loved that video
After so… so long… the goblin brains come together
You did it.
I love DnD!!!! And your channel!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
THE WALMART UNIFORM OMG
Jaiden’s Character which is Just a Dragon Enjoying Life & I Love It, If I Was Anyone In an DND Canpain, Jaden Dragon would Literally Be Me.
PLEASE jaiden do more of this, this is perhaps one of the most entertaining and digestible DND videos ever, never before has my urge to have friends to play DND with been so high, thank you for this amazing masterpiece team!!!
Keyleth Vex Pike and Grog 🥰
FINALLY, IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS NGOESNPJGSO pls more
Rip slimsicle gone to soon
4:33 over the garden wall reference \(//∇//)\
Ranboo is now Cat Pat
Jaiden is another reason I animate
Why was Paul so much like Gladion from sun and moon?
Petition for Jaiden to make an animated series or anime about this
This was a joy to watch, congrats on a wonderful first DND session!!
THE VOX MACHINA CAMEO!!!!!!
i don't know if this was intentional by ranboo or not but the fact that he made a crown and then there's a T on it? I'm seeing a man who is carrying on Technoblade's legacy o7
Omg slayyy that was great Its been years since i finished a video of yours but i really enjoyed this one! Great animation and funny story with food visual memes and nice moments the ending was amazing as well!! Im sad i wont get something this quality for a while;-;
STOP THE SHEEP LOOKS LIKE ASRIEL FROM UNDERTALE FOR SOME REASON.
I love how Mark specifically only had beef with Ranbo’s character yet decided to curse Alpha’s son. Either to deal with the lose of his own kid or bc Ranbos character didn’t have any loved ones to curse
this video has made my day
That was awesome! ❤😁
We need the vod
RANBOO???
i love dnd
Finally ranboo fulfilled the prophecy and made a split face cat sona .
i love that Ranboo is just the dnd version of bongo cat. it fits them so well.
I feel bad for the dude. Jaiden is brutal. Dudes depressed and she was all like *almost kills him*
THIS WAS SO GOOD OMG YALL NEED TO PLAY MORE AND MAKE MORE VIDS OF THIS, LIKE A PART 2 WITH THESE CHARACTERS  (Paul is iconic)
Why were the animals so cuteee?
bro i saw the thumbnail and i bout near died from the pure excitement of the four of yall playin dnd
I kinda want to make Ari as a dnd character like a arrocora barbarian
It’s funny how mark was honestly not bad the other 2 were bro got people trying to steal his job his neighbor is spreading rumors about him even after he got a restraining order on his neighbor he still plagues him
MOREEeEEEeE
tobi
Dying from getting an critical failure from a choice is so insulting.
Could you make 1 more nuzlocke videos
Mark being a walmart manager is funny.
I wanna play D&D now…
THIS WAS HILARIOUSSSSSSSSS MAKE MORE OF THESE!
4:15 IS THWT THE GUY FROM OVER THE GARDEN WALL
I saw that meme reference at 9:13
Zoot follows up behind and screams DEPRESSION. Got me XD
Man, I loved it when Zoot said,”It’s acid blastin’ time!”
i am so confused
SLAY
The fact that Jaden made no mention of the backstory of her own character makes it even more funny, like, you HAVE to watch the full session if you wanna know about the *coin toss*
PLEASE! Keep playing D&D and animating your stories. This is epic!
It's the Wal-Mart vests that had me dying! 😂😂😂 that depression spell just made it 10x worse and more hysterical!  Love you Jaiden!❤
Play D&D more and don't spray Alpharad with mace
Jayden: *pulls out passivism* how about genocide *proceeds to acid blast mark in the face*
The first time I played I was also a Dragonborn.
I love watching these videos. They're so funny and I enjoy listening to Jaiden's voice
I just realized that Alpharad made his character Larry from Scarlet and Violet!😂
10:48 "NICE JUICY ANKLES YA GOT"
goblins are roasting the adventure time horse....
An amazing adventure starring Mega Charizard X, Sanji, Rocket Raccoon and Sheep
Why dose alphad look like sanji ?
i'm one minute in, i see a black dragonborn, a tabaxi bard and a barbarian. BOY i'm in for a ride. let's go.
we stan Paul
Am I the only one who notices that most of music in the start is wind waker music and some Kirby music like dededes theme?
It was... So emotional 😢
Why is ranboo always a furry when playing DnD lmao😭😭
My earphones mess up whenever I’m near a microwave that’s being used and they decided to mess up when the sheep yelled “WHY DID YOU SPRAY ME WITH MACE!” And I thought that was part of the script
Gotta love the critical role reference too lol
15:45  DEDEDE THEME!!!!!
I love that me and Jaiden chose the same race for our first DND characters :D Silver Dragonborn here! I have also point blank hit someone with my ice breath multiple time LOL, one time with my mouth on the person.
Mark was just unfazed with all the physical damage but the emotional damage hit him hard.
8:59  **C.R.O.W.N.E.D starts playing**
jaiden’s character being a dragonborn is so on-character
I remember this play through when you were doing the subathone
I’m going to play and summon a nuclear howitzer as a wizard now
bru why is alpharad intro just him doing the Yoshikage Kira
Great video Jaiden!
Why could I tell which person rolled a natural 1 in the story?
Paul looks like and reminds me of Larry in Pokémon scarlet and violet
is that the horse from adventure time the goblins are cooking😭
I can not believe some of the youtubers that I like played dnd together- also Alpharad plays dnd?
OMGGGG RANBOO'S IS SO MUCH LIKE HIM
That was incredible 😂😂😂
You know, I never would have thought to use "Depression" for a Command spell.
The only correct way to introduce people to DnD is by highlighting the chaos that can be unleashed within minutes of playing.
This was the funniest and best vid ive ever seen🤣please do this more often with your party🙏
Oh my God. Jaiden! Using Command to give your enemy depression is a level of evil not even villains would sink to
best 17 mins and 43 seconds ive ever wasted lol
As soon as I saw the thumbnail I was like "WAIT WHY IS MY DUDE RANBOO HERE WHAT THE FU-"
THIS IS MY FAV PRE-MADE
I been in a dnd campaign that started just like that But it didnt at all how it continued
Me and my party tried to scam a bunch of villagers for no reason
Why does Paul remind me of Ron Stampler..?
Yep, that's just the right amount of crazy for first time player backstories. Wish I had thought to be stuck in a timeloop as a backstory
This made me wanna play d&d
i want more of this!!
Your energy really recharged my spirit, thank you
Dragonborn running on kolbolt software.
Happy new video :D
4:16 "coooome wayward souls that wonder through the darkness, there is a light for the lost and the weak"
I like the Vox Machina cameo at the beginning of the video
Paul is the best
VOX MACHINA AT THE BEGINNING!
Alpharad went and made Larry a character
1:14 NO WAY VOX MACHINA REFERENCE??
That cursed talk thing Jayden does reminds me of Jujutsu Kaisen
I just did a BOOM BOOM...
Y’all should all play Baldurs Gate 3 and stream it, it’s pretty much dungeons and dragons with a video.
Jaiden as dragonborn is so cute 😍 As a dragonborn main,  I stan Zoot
I loved every part of this ahahahaha
First time I ever heard of casting "depression" •-•  Who was really the bbeg here !
this was sick i’ve just started DMing so this was super fun to watch
What song is 16:37?
I love the little critical role references! Seeing Keyleth and Vex and the others in the bar made me grin. It's also just amazing to see YouTubers that I love playing one of my favourite games
" DEPRESSION! "
Alpharad has that Larry energy
I love how you know what they were trying to do and then depending on the outcome, you know if they rolled a high or low number
I love the Vox Machina easter eggs throughout the video. This video tickled my nerd heart even more than the usual Jaiden video and I love it lol
I’ve got all the stuff to play but around where I live there’s nowhere for me to go learn to play
I want more
If you do this again, definitely keep more bits with the other players reactions, that acid blast moment was hilarious😂😂
What is the music here? 8:10
Ya'll turned the sheep back into a human? Personally, I would've eaten it.
you’re a literal dragon born awesome
1:53 WHO STARTS A CONVERSATION LIKE THAT
D&D
Ohhh that was GLORIOUS
YEAHHHH I LOVE HOW YOU ANIMATE CHARLIE AkA SLIMECICLE Aka CHARLIE SLIMECICLE
WAS NOT expecting the acid blast.
Jaiden i The Devil
Dragonborn supremacy let's goo
Only thing without closure was the cat in the time loop, but I guess, to be fair, that's the idea of rewatching the video😋
jaiden became his ex wife embraces himthen kamehas his ass
best video to come out from you since the asexual one
The ending was so cute
*ITS WORMIN TIME* 8:22
I’m always a dragon born I only played once
I want to see you react to the Dnd movie: Dungeons and Dragons Honor among thieves
How many Nat 1s were rolled that game?  Seems like an improbable, yet not impossible, number of critical failures.
good job on actually letting there be a satisfying ending. Dingo doodles accidentally told a dnd story but didn't say what came next and now they're a dnd channel because people just kept on wanting to know what was next.
WHAT DO I DO TO GET A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT CHAOTICLY AMAZING?!
I have Jumped into a pit twice and drowned myself once in dnd
"Mart of Wall" ah yes The perfect store
15:28       your welcome
Of course Jaiden is a dragonborn (not judging)
I did a dnd once where there was a sheep with a speak animal scroll who used to be a wizard, but was turned into a sheep.
I was playing dnd and I had babies with a dragon but then the dm got sick of it and locked her away
Next final boss Zachery form target
There was a demon barrier blocking me and my party from escaping a manor we was and making us follow a certain path. While the others was fighting the imps off. My rogue who is a tiefling decided to shout at the barrier in the infernal language to 'let me pass'. The DM makes me roll for intimidation. I roll quite high (not nat 20 but not far off either) and he just says 'the barrier is still up but you scare everyone in the building'. I return back to the party and casually announce 'shouting at the barrier didn't work' XD
this was actually hilarious
I love it.
I can’t believe there was no one mentioning vox machina in the beginning of the vid in the inn
Now i want to play dungeons and dragons too
*dies laughing*
''and proceseds to ascid spread him intro the face''
Lol, as usual, the lore in the gameplay gave me “😅” vibes, but it was entertaining overall. In most D&D sessions I sit and observe in, a lot of players rage against unlucky dice rolls, which I sometimes laugh at, and sometimes question the dungeon master’s twists, but your friend seems to be a pretty fair master.
I feel like I’ve seen this before
The laup to Paarl ohhhhhh
15:07 though
See jaiden playing dnd  Me who is working on their first campaign “gotta take notes and stea- I mean take inspiration
Are the goblins eating that one horse from adventure time at 9:57
1:03 innit
Alpharad's character is just larry from pokemon scarlet/vilolet
You can FEEL the fails and nat 1's!! Loved the VM reference as well ❤❤
perfect just perfect i wish i had friend's to play dnd
Lil Vox Machina Easter egg
JAIDENJAIDENJAIDEN THANK U SÓ MUCH U JUST COVINCED ME TO PLAY D&D BCAUSE IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF ORGANIZED ANSWERS!!!!!!! srry I was too hyped…….😅😅😅
*Lop*
please more Jaiden Quest!!
I love Zoot. They are an icon.
Wow! That is relatable! (never played dnd)
Ahhhh commenting before i continue watching! VOX MACHINA!!!! AHHHHH
D&D is my most favourite game so even before I watched the video I deemed it my most favourite Jaiden Animation video ever
The only weird thing in this is why jaiden voiced everyone? I mean, dont you live in the same house as alpharad?
I ran this oneshot a while ago its so fun. Wild sheep chase i think its called, its free.
Zoot Zoot Noot Noot
Wait what happened to the small naked man?
I wana do a dnd so badly but i have no friends lol
dnd looks so fun, but it looks so complicated to play, and i could never be put on the spot and just say the first thing that comes to my mind
I love that Paul is a full embodiment of  Larry.
Yeild-mart of wall
Love that Paul just has absolute Larry (S&V) vibes the whole time.
Now play Warhammer 40k
oh that was SICK
This was soooo good !
This is a whole anime lore  I love it
Alex used gun spell
SO GOOD!!! I LOVED IT AAAA.   I honestly would like to hear ran Charlie and Alpharad voicing their own characters. Not that your voice acting skills aren’ amazing-but it’d be neat to hear what the characters would’ve actually sounded like in this world-especially with it being so well animated. Either way well done! Will be watching over and over again
Can I do the dungeon master next time? I'm Goin to create a no sense adventure!
Would love to see more like this was so much fun watching hope to see more dnd videos ❤❤
Sounds like an awesome campaign! 🎉
Few things are more pure than watching someone's first session
oh my gosh, this group is just beautiful XD
OMG Alpharads Larry energy is hilarious!😂
AWWEE THATS AWOSME AND I HOPE U DO MORE
Jaiden just tricking the manager was sooo f-ing hilarious
Mark:ill be back...
THE VOX MACHINA EASTER EGG AHHH
Omg Jaiden, your animation style was MADE for this! D&D series please!
This is basically roleplay but the characters power play and become god, ah good times
Aww that critical role easter egg is super sweet.
Is it a coincidence how alpharads character (Paul) looks like Larry from pokemon?
I need therapy after watching this.
why the fuck does ranboo look like Simon from Fionna and cake
wait you also chose a druid dragonborn
I wish I could’ve caught more of the character creation stream! It was so much fun for what I was there for
Jaiden’s been playing Wind Waker lately, hasn’t she
the moment i see Jaiden saying D&D i just say "oh boy here we go"
Just barely able to se him… and aced blasted him in the face😂😂😂
More like this please.
I saw the adventure time horse reference
This was so funny
Jayden how are we so insanely alike
MORE! WE NEED MORE OF THIS!!! MORE DND!!! MORE RPG!!!
Alpharad just became Larry
Can we be friends?
This was so fun to watch, more of this plz ^^
Command: Depression is inspired, excellent work!
it lowkey feels like Jaiden is turning into Pewdiepie with each of her videos just activating and thriving any fandom/game/activity
8:20 I can clearly hear charlie saying WORMIN TIME
this doesn't actually felt like a gameplay... it felt like you were narrating a story, like what if detective Pikachu happened in parallel universe...
i love that alphrad is larry
Lol that was a Bloody Good Game.....
Well, this was pure comedy gold.
Those vox machina  charecters have awoken a deep slumbering memory
whats the song at the end? its so cool (nice video as always)
Yeeeaaaahhhhh...  That sounds about right 😂
ngl i kinda wana play dnd now
Plz for part two
9:51 are they eating the ice king ?? 😭
Play DSA and LARP
you watched vox subscription is now demanded for me
I loved when the worm said "it's wormin time" and wormed all over the place
omg the Vox Machina cameo i was not expecting that for some reason
Good
Can we all agree that jaiden would be a great dungeon master
The game seems intresring, you made me want to play D&D! :)
The Vox Machina easter egg in the beginning was amazing lol
omg i love this video XDDDDDDDDD i had a very good time watching this. Very nice 10/10 i cant explain how fun that was
I’m new to DnD and I would like to get my friends into it. Since I am going to be the one introducing the game to them, naturally I would have to be the DM right? But I would rather play as a character player instead. Any advice on this?
Can we just appreciate that Alpharad is just a blonde Larry
Need more of this please
love the references 😄
I absolutwly love this. I swear one day ill play DnD with my friends
MEU DEUS ISSO TA PEEFEITO, UMA VIBE REGULAR SHOW
Gotta love that reference to Vox Machina at the beginning
my fucking sides!!!
This new format is so amazing  Make more of it plz
Dang it!! I’ve been wanting to use this sheep module for the longest time. I still plan on using it, but i hope none of the players i get see this video lol
The background music..🤌🤌
Ohh the vox machina reference nice
que chulo, amazing from Spain
That acid blast thing is something my party would do and my very first d and d session my dm made the shop Walmart and variations of it like tall mart where if you are a certain hight you get a discount
9:53 oh yes, if you know you know, but also if you dont, i feel sorry for you.
The fact that the door actually used the word in a sentence was hilarious and genius.
I recognised this and wondered why before realising that I watched Alpharad's video on this months ago 😭
Loved the Vox Machina reference in the beginning Jaiden, great vid 👍.
I remember that horse that Ice king used in "Adventure time".
Why was the beast from over the garden wall their 😂😂
Honestly this so good jaiden should make a tv show
1:30  Why was it so obvious that Jaiden will be like that. Gorgeous animation. You are getting better by every single video you upload. Do your best and do not overwork yourself. I missed your notifications up until now
Bro she convinced me to buy a d&d
hey its vox machina
best animator
This is the most unhinged campaign I've seen, makes sense tho this is a very unhinged group
pls do more this kind of content
I *DO* want to marry an ogre
I love your videos and you are doing great ❤
Vox machina cameo? Okay I'm in!
Extremely entertaining, thank you.
I l'île this♥️
Nice video 😊
This was phenomenal, I would absolutely LOVE more videos like this about your future sessions! Nice Critical Role reference in there too 😛
Nice video 😊😊😊
Paul is genuinely such a funny character, i love Alpha's decision to just have a disgruntled former employee be in the midst of this fantasy adventure. I hope we get another session with him and the other two characters!
Does anyone know what song is playing at the end of the video?
This was amazing😂💙
Wheres the hour of clay, dirt and earth eating? That was my favorite part
Great video! Nice Vox machina reference!
1:14 VOX MACHINA
That Depression spell is one powerful spell 😂
Pitch this stuff as a movie
VOXXXX MAACHINAAAAA
Play fnaf
The only thing I don't like about this video is that the correct answer was "worm" and not "cloud."
Paul looks like he could be the best gym leader in a pokemon game
🎉 You know it’s a good day when Jaiden posts a video
Damn that was an amazing video awesome as always, your channel is always nostalgic we’ve all grown up so much from back in 2019
NO YOU DID NOT MAKE THE LEGENDS OF VOX MECHINA!! 1:10
Amazing content as usual , been seeing this channel from 3 years now , I feel old 😂
I love the Vox Machina reference at the beginning
PLEASE MAKE A PART 2
My first time playing, I had a really cool DM and he let us arrest a dragon for tax evasion instead of slaying it
Ahh yes dnd, where nothing goes as planed but when it does everyone is surprised.
dude vox machina in the inn 😂
15:28 turned him to burned nuggets right there lol 😂 😂
Mark reminds me off larry
Point blank acid breath after mega Deception. Talk about golden
Ha, Over the Garden Wall reference with the name of the turtle.
I'd kill for a podcast of this, it gives off big Dungeons and Daddies vibes. Loved every second of this 🤣
Liked the legend of vox machina reference in the start
We need more of this!
Should get into another dnd group like Ross and odd ones to try, heck I know you can do a 2nd video of this again and I bet it will be amazing
Paul kinda 👀
THIS WAS AMAZING
It took me until Jaiden disguising her character as bbeg's ex wife to realize i've seen the vod of the game
Is that Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga music during the door riddles? I think you unlocked a core memory 😅
Ranboo being the shortest character is really funny to me
Welcome to the rabbit hole. There is no escape.
This was SO GOOD!!! The game/quest was a great mix of fun and awesome! The players were inventive and invested! The DM did a FANTASTIC job of "yes, and"-ing the players' ideas. LOVE it! Makes me want to start up a new campaign with just a touch more silliness (there's some in mine, but I tend to aim closer to dramatic fantasy worlds because 🤷).
the vox machina cameo had me pointing at the screen yelling
Its was 2 years since iv seen one of your video this gives me memoris
Me and the boys playing D&D:
0:33 I am gonna unsubcribe I guess😢
@1:17 thats a crazy good Critical Role cameo
I've never played DND before, but this was one of the best things I've ever seen. Jaiden may have given Mark Thompson depression, but she and her gang cured mine.
This isn't D&D this is deltarune
Who caught vox machina at the beginning
🤣🤣🤣
1:51   My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
I love that at 1:17 you can see characters from legends of vox machina:,)
1:14 nice "Another round for Vox Machina, the greatest band of mercenaries in the realm!"
This would make the best show 😂
I wish I had a campaign like that, it sounded like it wad a lot of fun  Hope to see more D&D Adventure animations
such an amazing one-shot! the animation was spectacular!
Kept rolling 3s huh?
can wee see the real time play vidieo it can be nice and funny
"an invisible source they can't see"      that's what invisible means.
CHARLIE AND RAN PLAY DND???!?
I need more D&D animated! Give me more Jaiden!
More
I like the Vox Machina characters in the inn
I loved the vox machina reference
D E P R E S S I O N
8:15 what song is that
By just hearing that Slimecicle was dungeon master, I already knew the video was going to get nuts!
what an absolute fantastic video!
Damn Mark really hit that obito dipping out of there
Man, that word cast Depression followed up with the shape shift and acid breath to the face is possibly one of the most brutal acts I've seen carried out against a BBEG. *insert emotional damage meme here*
I'm taking your advice and unsubscribing. I find you objectively and exquisitely boring and the opposite of charismatic. Have fun being lonely.
do more.
👇 POV: Paul = U
The next time they do this, one of them should have a gun.
(The riddles were hard to understand)
This was like a really good movie but friends put their ideas in
Wow, that’s really cool Jaiden :D I’m a huge fan of role playing and I’m glad you got to do it with Charlie, Ranboo, and Alpharad
I really love that you didn't shorthand any of the classes or spells butbinstead described them. That way even people who don't love dnd just get to enjoy the story, and people who know, still recognize the classes and features.
That’s it. I need to get an artist to play in our group.
WILD SHEEP CHASE! The best starting module.
as someone who's currently going through their first campaign I clicked this immediately
I want more of this videos pels
NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE??? Anyways love your videos and hope you liked your first dnd session!!
Don't usually comment but... I need more of this 😂
This was SOOOO GOOOD
i NEED more of this this is so funny and good and omg and akjhwerkjlakwljerjlkawjlkr
OK this actually sounds fun
Omg jaiden's character is exactly like mine lol
Ah yes, each of their characters respective problems Middle management Mean neighbors and apparent time loops Eats clay and y'know, worm
Jo I have a question. Did you ever play Monster Hunter?
This animations looks like it's in 2019 💀
I love dnd :D
Paul is larry
The joy and unhinged shenanigans of a brand new party is always so wholesome (or degenerate. Either way is fun lol). New players always just do ANYTHING.
i just realized luap backwards is paul as in paul jr
DM for 3 yers Best game
So are we not gonna talk about the "Bong Water" joke with Paul Jr.    *I saw that Jaiden*
Omg Ranbo this was the crossover I never thought I needed
i demand more of this type of content
Something tells me jaiden had fun animating her character, if not this entire campaign
As soon as I saw Jacobs character I thought of Larry
Larry... I mean Paul was great.
PUAL IS  LARRY!!!
Aight we're gonna need a session 2, this was way too enjoyable
I got to play dnd this year for the first time its so fun until I accidentally cloned myself with wild magic and now my character has an Identity crisis
I don't know why, but I also would have eaten the clay.
Is Alpha’s character’s hair supposed to look like Nanami’s?
I love that the image you show for Alpharads character is Larry. Lmao
pee pee poo poo
Wait wait wait….did I just see a Vox Machina cameo?!
love the Vox Machina easter egg
Kudos to you for adding Critical Role campaign 1 characters into your D&D story art. Good job! You are now a critter. Hehehe! :D
MAKE IT A PODCAST
We need more of this stuff these 3 are the colbe I didn't know I needed literally my 3 favorite content creators
Weeee NEEEEEDD MOORRREEEE
her community knows she never uploads so she got 3M in 3 days 🤣
I never felt so many emotions for a dnd villain, up until she acid blasted him
I was playing dnd with my cuz and he wanted to pickpocket the goblins that we were fighting and he rolled a n20 so in direct daylight he snuck across with no were to hide and the goblins didn't see him but these goblins are only wereing a groin cloth so he reached in the groin cloth and started squeezing u know what so he pee his groin cloth screamed and ran away the others got scared and ran away to and thats how we defeated them
Usually in a d&d campaign when someone says something similar to what jaiden said; "...and acid blast him point-blank from the mouth..." That is usually the reaction you would get out of a dm. 'Cause even if everyone expects it, those situations are always funny.
Everyone: wow, what a cool video. Glad to see you in dnd Me: whell, after 20 hours of thoughts, including that you were dragonborn, and could use those 2 spells, your class should be.... Sorcerer?( Please give me answer, Jaiden) hope that I spelled your name ( and some words) correctly
As cheesy as that was for a story, it’s great to see a short D&D adventure and honestly well rounded for the action and mystery. Just wish I had people I could play with 😭 and I’m not informed enough to be a dungeon master
How’s Ari
THE FUCKING ADVENTURE TIME HORSE BEING KILLED NOOOO
Heck yeah, Vox Machina getting hammered in the old oak inn!
I can still hear charlie's voice even with the filter lmao
1:14 love the vox machina reference
Wild Sheep Chase?
Why does paul look like Larry from scarlet and violet?
THE EASTER EGGS WERE AWESOME! Seeing the characters from Vox Machina sends chills!
The main thing I've heard of DnD is my brother's character, a skeleton who was a corrupted priest. The party found him as a skull and there was an arc if them finding his body. They put DnD on hold right before finding the body...
the adventure time horse on the fire is so funny lol
Hi jaiden i never played dungeons and dragons so this really helped me so when I play it this will be helpful so thanks
Why did I get un subed I've been sunbed for years ND just now saw I wasn't happy I'm back now
The casual Vex, Grog, Keyleth and Pike is so good
Couldn’t stop laughing
9:54 ADVENTURE TIME HORSE
Depressed mark is giving me sadness
This is magical (literaly)
I love the easter egg of vox machina also sitting in the tavern 😍
You're character is so cuuuuute!
That was fantastic!!
That critical role cameo 😂
1:13 my heart <3 i miss vox machina... i also miss mighty nein... :')
Please do another nuzlockkkkkkkk
Wow
This video was funny and great, and Jaiden is so awesome.
Only jaiden would put her first "subscribe" message in a way that also tells a portion of her viewers to UNSUBSCRIBE. We love you Jaiden.
I want a DND experience like this, I don't know where I can find one 😢
This is some dingo Doodles type stuff
I love the cat :D
She’s backkkkkkk
Welcome to the world of dnd. It's addicting.
Best video yet in the channel
Critical Roll reference anyone?
Not me watching this video for my 3rd time (2nd was Slimecicle's reaction)
DUDE THE ALL THE REFERENCES ❤️
ok
It was very fun
To be honest it’s sad that I can’t watch you on Facebook anymore because of someone but I guess YouTube well have to do from now on miss Jaiden animations
i dont play t at all i IMAGINE it :D
In my party our main inn is the Drunken Dragon inn
I WANT MORE
1:16 critical role reference?
I feel like I'm reading a 9 year old's fanfiction.
Luap being Paul was a genuine surprise 🤣 I felt that OHHHH
I hope they upload the whole dnd session, but the highlights are fine. This was so chaotic I loved it!
Somehow I completely unsurprised by the characters you guys made.
More stuff like this, please!!!
Pls play genshin impact 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
why does a dragonborn have mace      its dnd im not suprised
When the place blows up in the end I can just hear 'action movie hero boy' by lemon demon playing in the background. I really hope they do another! Ranboos character was so creative!! And I love Jaydens dragon born.
Loved that OTGW reference in the forest
I have a question how old is Ari?🤔
Wow ❤❤❤❤ Very nice
BRO THIS WAS AMAZING!!! You should so do this again! 😂😂😂
thats 4 of the mebers of vox mokina
Alfrad looks like larry form pokemon scarlet and violet
Horse from advanture time 😅!
NEED MORE ASAP
vox machina 1 10
More please
love this vid and the way the dragon born yelled depression reminded me of inumaki lol
My Dad is literally named Paul jr. 😭
Wow you know ran oo cool😊
Oak
Please do more dragonborn and cat drawings in your animations they are amazing in this style
The first thing I hear is daisy circuit from Mario kart- Yeah, it’s gonna be a good video!
More jad I want more of this d&d videos 🥺😭
Blonde Larry is so cute
dude charlie as a dm is PERFECT in every way possible and they way jaiden drew dm charlie has me im a CHOKEHOLD! GREAT WORK JAIDEN!!!!
The horse costume ice king wears is a awsome refrance
Dude, Slimecicle's DnD sessions are always insane, so you joining just made it better.
I am inspired as a DM by the clay monster room. Lemme just *steals unapologetically *
its crazy amazing how my two favourite groups of content creators are making content together now!!
good
OH MY GOD THIS WAS INCREDIBLE!! <3
Alpharad as Larry is GOLDEN
This was beautiful but also perhaps some day we could get voice acting from the cast too?? I think it would really flesh everything out
The fact that me and my friends are also starting a session tomorrow
fine fact i did play it and my friend ethan became a damn god and murdered kids :D
OMG ITS PIKE I LOVE SO PIKE MUCH
Wow, never played before and Jaiden knows immediately that you give the npc a nickname you can remember and that's that.
yesss I LOVE DND i play it all the time
who else recogniszed vox machina
Paul is just the perfect character, congrats to the person who made him
It's so weird seeing my different fandoms cross together and the content creators making content together but I am HERE for it
The dices were paid actors
DnD stories are always a blast to hear so heres mine: The party of various creatures walk into a tavern, little by little half of the party begin drinking excessively. Me, the only sensible one (btw im a 3’4 owlin that has been put in many party members pockets) decide to continue the story and search the kitchen for people who haven’t been turned into stone, while the rest of the party are in the basement(literally all of them are drunk, and unsurprisingly a lot of them threw up already). Eventually, me and an elf get ushered into the basement as the dungeon master informs us that a BIG HONKIN’ RATTO BOI is in the basement (to be continued)
"DEPRESSION!" Is the best use of a command spell I have EVER seen.
1:39  What it sounds like: "I'm Paul."  What it feels like: "My name is Yoshakagi Kira."
I like how jaiden doesn’t have a backstory she’s just a dragon at a bar and just goes along with it
GRABOID!!!
I've seen a similar reddit post to the luring in the bad guy with ex wife and acid spitting on his face maybe your DM made a reddit post about it lol
If I even tried to do this with any of my friends we’d end up causing 9/11 again
alr Jaiden thx to you i got involved with D&D but idk how to make one so can anyone give me any tips on how to make one?
Please do more!
NO WAY ITS THE SHEEP ONESHOT. I WAS GONNA RUN THIS
more D&D
Love the Vox Machina Critical Role easter egg
does no one else think that alphas character is just larry from scarlet/violet
The immediate vox machina reference ❤
@jaidenanimations character straight up looks similar to Susie from deltarune
Slay
0:56 "Hi, I'm Jaiden. 26, Kobold...Walmart greeter..."
“Starts a casual conversation”  *“D o   y o u   k n o w   M a r k ?”*
I've only played one game of dnd. The best part was when we got to the boss room where we were supposed to fight a dimension shifting bee thaf fed on dreams of kidnapped humans. An orphan was kidnapped and we had gone in to rescue her. Said orphan children were not happy when instead of killing the queen we made a deal to trade her prisoners as victims in exchange for free magical artifacts. She started screaming, in response, my buddy who was playing as a 7 foot tall cow person gave her brain damage by bashing her in the head with his staff and a nat 20 crit. We could have used a sleep spell on her, knocked her out in a more gentle way, simply ignored her, straight up reality shifter her back home, gagged her, or listened to her and simply killed the queen bee. But no, the best option was to have the 7 foot tall cow monster bash her in the head.
im in a dnd campaign rn, i play a rogue kobold named Terri "the terrible" bold. i throw up any spell i learn. ill explain a bit in detail  dm: "a half rotten door blocks your path."  me: "ill use acid splash to melt the door" (this is an ongoing gag that terri hates doors)  dm: "terri throws up on the door. it instantly melts."
Love the goblins eating the creepy horse from adventure time
I've read this adventure before. As soon as the sheep showed up with the scroll it rung a bell. I absolutely love the twist and personal flavour that Charlie put on it. I've been planning on using this same adventure to introduce some friends to D&D as well. I may steal some of the details :P
Vox Machina!!
I also played as a lizard thing in my first campaign, but in my most recent campaign (which was a space adventure one) I was an 112 year old goo alien named Laushi and I b!tch slapped everything to death. It's probably my favourite campaign so far, honestly.
Love this vid!!! That D&D was awesome to hear!
I just watched the birthday series for ari and did my big brain calculations and he/she/they is 7?
The peeler gives me severe Maverick vibes from Omori. “It’s not peeler it’s THE peeler.”
cool
Literally about to do my first dnd session, I love this so much
Oh man that was a good one. Hey if you do a follow up maybe ask dingosoodles or puffinforest to join? That would be fun!!!
Holy Shit this is like a full tv show!! Incredible quality!
Awesome. I love well told and we'll animated dnd games. Bit disappointed about the lack of medieval fantasy feel. But the excellent use of video game music made up for it.
The blond guy is acts like lary from pokemon squarlet and violet 😂😂😂😂
Please, please, pleeeeease do more of these. Your humour and animation style are the perfect combination to make amazing videos like this!!!
Sounds like a fun time was had by all.   Except maybe the turtle. ;)
IT DIDN'T START IN A TAVERN
Oh my gosh you're a dragonborn too?
I used to think that dnd was for nerds but after hearing this I now want to play
I WANTED TO PLAY DND BEFORE   NOW NONE CAN STOP ME!!!!
Dragonroost Island in the background made it that much better, another masterpiece Jaiden!
A WILD SHEEP CHASE LETS GOG
Imagine if she plays at paranormal order with Cellbit and make a video like this
That was amazing. Pure beauty.
WE NEED MORE OF THIS DND GROUP OML
HELL YEA VOX MACHIN⚔⚔⚔⚔
Gurl you gon have me play this game and make characters and everything now😂🩵  Just for a new story  Thank you for the Adventure Time reference💙💙💙
My most chaotic dnd moment was when my party put a guy in a barrel with rice and rolled it down a hill and it broke on a tree.the body was mangled after that we called our self’s the barrel rollers
Is alpharad's character based off of Larry from Pokemon scarlet and violet?
I like how alpha just made him as larry
this does also remind me of the first time I ever played dnd and I also played a dragonborn character. I was so excited about the acid breath that I used it IMMEDIATELY and got the party into HUGE trouble and I DON'T REGRET IT.
Nice emotional manipulation at the end! When I did that, my DM said I was being "too cruel" and "if this game had karma, you would probably go to hell"
my favorite part of DnD is always making joke characters. Any time I start a campaign with a group I first think "what bit am I doing and committing to for this entire campaign?" and it's usually being a rude dickhead. I made a halfling barbarian character once and he was an absolute shitlord and I love him. His sword was literally as tall as him and he'd only go into a rage after being treated like a kid for his height.
Acid to the face was amazing!!!!!!!!
VOX MACHINA REFERENCE :O
1:42 ye old mart of wall, with thine great deals which make thine  smiles bright as a sunny day
DnD is so fun
So something funny (if you care) Markiplier was playing phasmophobia and the ghosts name was Mark Tompson
Incredible as always! 'Love anytime slimecicle popped into frame. and the use of King Dedede's theme at the end; amazing
Love your animated adventures!!
Omg I have been told multiple times I should play Dungeons and dragons by my aunt, friends, etc, and I really wanna learn how but don’t know how to start, so this video popping up on my for you page is like a sign that I should play! Congrats, Jaden, you have made me officially decide to play D&D!  Btw edit real quick I thought I should throw in that Alpharads character he made reminds me of the normal gym leader Larry from scarlet/violet ngl
The poor talking door. They did him dirty. He even blew up at the end.
I was able to recognize Luap real identity as soon as he appeared 🤓
Mfw when Critical Role reference !!
As soon as I heard everyone who was playing, I knew this would be a hell of a video.
DID NO ONE ELSE NOTICE VOX MACHINA WAS IN THE TAVERN???
Using "Roar of Dedede" as the theme of the final battle was the best decision ever istg, i loved everything!!!, it must've been a blast!!, i've always wished to play D&D, i hope i get to do it one day
jaiden never stop playing dnd if this is the outcome. your gift at animation brought this already epic tale to life- mad props gang gang and slay.
My dad really loves Dungeons & Dragons win he was young.
And are you playing god because you shouldn't play with fire.
"If you don't think that's fun, we probably wouldn't get along, and you should probably unsubscribe"   me: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
Is Alpharad just Larry from Pokémon sv
1:38 Jojo refference Search: I am kira yoshikage I'm 33 years old For original footage.
I absolutely fucking lost it when you used emotional and psychological warfare against mark and shot his face with acid I couldn't breathe 😂😂😂
i love how jacob was basically larry from scarlet and violet but with a twist lol
Dragonborn lovers rise up
Jojo reference at 4:30 into the vid
Nothing says DnD like playing as a middle management human😂😂
I know someone who is a manager named mark Thompson and now i feel like im being watched
why does Alpharad look like Larry from pokemon scarlet and violet
Knowing me I would have made a certain... Inappropriate Object...
Omg this all sounds super fun! I've never playde DND, where can I play?
You know there’s a Pokémon version of this game
I can't help laughing at that climactic battle, especially when Zoot/Jaiden fucking BLASTED him in the face!
i wanna play it i played it someway cus they have like a board game of it but i never played the actual game
Part 2 pls!!!😊😊😊
WHATS THE SONG NAME I FORGOT ITTT😭
1:14 Vox Machina Cameo for the blind folks who didn’t catch it- Grog, Pike, Keyleth, and Vex are all talking and Drinking.
ALPHARAD IS LARRY
The closest I’ve ever been to having interest in D&D is D&D Heroscape.
I would love more videos of crazy dnd sessions, this video was great!
1:44  He seems like Larry
Bro my first time playing DND I was a boxer unicorn with special White slim he could shoot out and I ended up busting one all over the dragon zombies and exacaped the zombie prison with a Bud light in my left hand
I Wana play it
I died when the Sheep started RAMpaging around the place. Laughed so hard my lungs exploded
Love, love, loved this video. It is one of my favourite DND animations i have seen in some time. Loved the one full session approach. that was super fun!
I can only agree with their decision to consume the clay. The clay looked so delicious.
no one show this video to peta
I LOVED THIS EP PLEASE DO MORE LIKE IT!!!!! I LOVE D AND D
Jacob just being Larry is the best thing ever
"At the wall of mart" I've made a similar joke as a DM, whenever my pc's don't give a shit where they buy stuff, I just say they pick it up at the ye old "Halt and Barter" (stop and shop)
Welcome to the shadow realm, Jimbo
0:30 ok no balls
1:15 nice vox machina reference
Bro I just was thinking of trying D&D, saw this vid now I really wanna try it out!
That was pafect haushsushs
The Paul Jr. bit caught me off guard
I play dnd as a job
ah i see jaiden has uploaded- wait, wAIT IS THAT RANBOO!? OH MY GOD I MUST WATCH THIS
You do know you can play as a bird person right? like from Maximum Ride, hint: please play more so you can play as an asimar aka a bird person.
Jacob as Larry is my favorite thing ever
why was the horse fromadventure time over the fire in the goblin scene
Good eve's dear lady hoping you have a splendid night you and your family cheers to you ma'am ciao😎🌹🌹.
This sound like something I would find insanely fun.  Excellent video! 🤣
Achievement unlocked, best ending?
Jaiden is basically just an upgraded argonien and I'm very concerned
I appreciate the Over the Garden Wall references. I've also forgotten how pleasant the Outset Island music is.
What is the ending song?
I love the tribute to critical role!!!!
Am I the only one to notice at the intro there were The Legend of Vox Machina characters
Awesome video. In your next pokemon nuzlocke challenge, can you do one for pokemon black and white or pokemon black 2 and white 2, please?
9:51 THEY KILLED SIMON
DRAGON BORNS ARE OVERRATED
The music has me STIMMINGGGGGG!!!!!!
THEIR LAUGHS AT 15:30–  I can’t. Pure gold ❤
I finally got the context of the acid blast. Saw an out of context clip quite a while back, glad to finally see it.  Also did the outro just got 10x smoother??
The fact that I made my first DND character ever the same day this video came out is crazy. I seriously think I can predict the future in unintentional ways (things like this have happened before-)
This reminds me of my D&D days and a fellow party member also impersonated a loved one and stabbed him and used vicious mockery strait after
that ending thou
Can you make a video of desigining for dnd?
This strikes me as such weird dnd like i assume you played with punishing natural 1s? But like just weird one shot dnd lol.  I legit think Jaiden would do well in a longer campaign
Perfect music choice with the sheep, let me tell you.
The bronze door is the most slimecicle ever
Don't say bad words it is a sin
RANDBOO IS A FURRY NOW       🤐
Don't draw the demonic circle
Ok but...... That's a tortoise not a turtle
thallamew got over being possessed really fast 😭😭
Jaiden: I cast DEPRESSION!
YO Finally, DnD is fun
I love how alpharad is just larry
I’ve been watching you for so many years, and same with Ranboo,I’m so glad you and Ranboo made a vid together
Anyone know what the song is at 16:10?
Vox Machina! 👀
I rolled 5 nat 20's for petting my frog
4:15 that’s the beast from the over the garden wall
Why the hell did someone make Larry from Scarlet and Violet into a dnd character 🤣🤣🗿
At my school we have DND classes
This was great. My first one shot i played ended with me burning everyone to ash after our barbarian died to a nutshot from a group of children.
Oh hey, I got the Zebra riddle right XD
"-and then ACID SPRAYS HIM POINT-BLANK IN THE FACE."
Not the mace I expected but XD
YAY HIS SON
Can you do Fortnite?
dragon born did you just think of it or have you played Skyrim
15:27 is easily the best part XD
Who else got the first riddle right
Vax machina
So a dragon a furry and sanji, checks out
Deveras cômico
More DND when?
I can totally imagine charlie saying "its wormin time"
Nice little detail making the turtles random names the ones from over the garden wall :)
The horse that the goblins were cooking was the same disguise horse that ice king was in from adventure time
Jacob looks like the normal type gym leader of Pokémon scarlet/violet
The Super Smash Bros Music!!! I noticed. lmao I love it.
I remember listening to the VOD of this!!!! It’s awesome to see it retold and animated!!
Hey I just wanted to say how’s Ari is he good
We once played and my Friend pulled out a glock in the game
I PLAY DND
i want to play dnd so bad but what can i do i know literally one person who plays it and im not close with them no one i am close with  has the game or knows anything about it
Holy hell my dream of seeing all my favorite YouTubes together. YES. Also I never played but I help make my fathers characters. Btw this is funny.
A child friendly version of Vox Machina I’m so in😊. TAKE MY MONEY JAIDEN!!
I love to play d&d
4:15 ITS MR BEEEEAAAASSSTTTT!!!!!!!!
That was really cool and funny, I'm still working on my dnd character  :0
best video keep up the good work you are getting better every video!I hope you have a blessed day/morning/evening/afternoon/night to all of you reading this:D
16:05 AVADA CADAVERA!        😾 🫲🏿👕👉🏿🪡       👖    🦵🏿🦵🏻
this video was to goofy  for my mortal brain
Vox machina casually chilling in the tavern was a nice touch
I’ve made a list of my favourite moments  “Butt strings” 5:49 The dead creature above the fire 9:51 15:21 and proceeds to ACID BLAST HIM POINT BLANK IN THE FACE 😭 poor guy XD
Loved the Vox Machina reference there :D
man this chapter of deltarune is crazy
i love this
The first time I played DND I kicked a demon in the balls so hard they flew into the sky and my mace hit it in the brain. Then we robbed a town. It was fun :D
INCREDIBLE
This is better when I played in DND club
this was an animated fever dream       and it's pretty cool
That was good. I quite enjoyed that, well done.
1:14 VOX MACHINA
How did I just notice that Paul’s design looks like Larry from SV lol
Hi
Wait, what about the turtle Paul Jr? I didn't see her leave just at the moment of the explosion 😱
WAIT A SECOND i smell a gravity falls reference! 4:11
ITS WORMIN’ TIME
That could tots be a whole movie
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Derpy little thing that happened in my first campaign (even though no one asked):   My friend was explaining that you could essentially do anything and the kid next to me low-key raised his hand and asked “can I eat a chair?”                    BTW I LOVED THIS VIDEO ❤❤❤❤❤❤
"oak trees turn into birch" OH NO NOT BIRCH
This was so much fun to watch! You should def do this again soon! ❤😃👌🏾
I actually played some DND today, this video was released at a perfect time for me
I like dnd it's just... I don't have enough time and friends to play it
Dear Jaden: Since you tried D&D and you are into Pokemon, I would TOTALLY suggest you to play Pokemon Tabletop Adventures. Same as D&D, but you become a Pokemon trainer instead
The asid in the face as his wife is bloody hecking funn6
This just absolute chaos and it’s hilarious
The vox machina reference made my day!
We need more of this
Paul got the second saddest backstory ever. Number 1 is guts from beserk that shit be crazy
We need a story about your character now
Please do more videos of you D&D games this was very interesting and fun to watch. 😊 I'll sub if you do 😁
THAT WAS SO AWESOME
Do more dnd on the main channel or make a second channel for just dnd story WHAT DOES THE DRAGON MEAN please continues the world of this crazy world
the vox machina characters at the beginning !!!
Please tell me alpharad is larry
If I was in this group. The first thing my character would have done was hug the sheep. Then proceed to run around in joy as a massive 9 ft tall bald giant. Toppling over people, chairs, tables… important characters.  Also I probably would have eaten the clay as well. And would probably continue eating it until the team stopped me.
Anyone else see Vox Machina in the tavern at 1:15 with Grog, Pike, Vax, and Keyleth? Great reference XD.
OH GOD YES
Oh man! I’d love to see more of this!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
That was perfect!  You could visibly see when the party rolled natural 1's, and the ex-wife scene at the end followed up by the acid just about killed me XD.
Indireta po cellbit oh
I love how Alpharad’s character is just Larry from Pokémon sv
I'm sorry but "Game Organiser/Manager/God" is how I will be referring to myself from now on
that was amazing and hope we get to see more dnd plus the dragon at the end was cool. p.s the dragon might have been mega charazard x
10:45 looks just a bit sus hmmm jaiden
10:28 I‘m so confused xD people say the gobble bit is a reference to adventure time but I thought it was Brooklyn 99 — especially bc of the last name Boyle xD
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEE DND🐛🪱🪱🪱🪱🪱
i love dnd  my favorite
I love how Alpharad's character is just Larry from Pokemon... AND IM ALL FOR IT!
Tongue tat go hard
DUDE. THESE ARE LIKE MY THREE FAVORITE CONTENT CREATORS-
16:47 ok but all the humor aside the ending was so wholesome 🥹
I also love dnd
Glad you have joined us in the DnD community and I would love to see mpre adventures
"Turtle"💀final answer
I WAS SO MAD ABOUT THE NAME REVEAL AT THE END 😂😂😂
I would love if this became a regular series. You also made my heart happy with the Critical Role reference. I love Vox Machina.
Please more the Lore and the Story is so good
Would you still let me be your boss if I was a.....
I played DnD i decapidated a wolf with a warhammer
Shoutout to Vox Machina drinking at the tavern!
"Don't listen to him, he's a Zebra." PLEASE-
Sheep with a speak to animals scroll is a classic at this point.
“ITS WORMIN TIME!” Is by far my favorite part
It's great how Jaden's a dragon and Ranboo's a cat stuck in a time loop while Jacob is just Larry Edit: Or is his name Paul I can't tell
Can u Post this videos vod
im so happy to see this get animated by you its exacly how i emginated it
Oh nice. If this turns into a Youtube series for you. That would be amazing.
“And so long ye bowsers him.” Lol why did I laugh so hard at this-
Why does Paul remind me of Larry from pokemon
I like how Paul is literally just Larry
"and Paul..... I expect to see you in for your shift tomorrow"
So Paul is my favorite non Larry character. Also if there is a season 2. Please see if jesse cox can hop in. Or hell even just as a npc voice guy. I'm sure he would help cause more chaos.
🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
Loving the vox machina reference in the beginning
If there is one thing you do it’s DO NOT LET THE CHULK BE THE DM
This was so cool and such a great video please do more like this🙏
Nobody gonna talk about the fact that alpharad is just larry
DnD is so much fun.
Where is Scanlan
Anyone heard of… Dingo Doodles?
Woahhh! I loved this! That's such a cool story too.
Again.
Jaiden... Thanks for that vox machina/critical role reference really appreciate it 1:15 also 11:39 16:16
This is such a great collab.
15:30 XD
I WANT A FULL SERIES OF THESE ADVENTURES!!!!!!!!! WHO AGREES?!
THAT WAS SICK
This is why I love DnD.
Dingo doodle fans using this to cope with our missing 2 month update episode wya
MMOOAARR D&D!!! Seriosly tho, this is now my favorite video from jaiden ever :)
The riddle door was really hard to understand for a non native speaker.
I JUST REALIZED THAT PAUL IS JUST LARRY FROM POKÉMON
That dm must be really great, they brought each chatacters story to a satisfying conclusion through the action, great job!!
Oh my goood the vox machina/critical role reference not even a minute and a half In I love it
Hahaha man, I thought for a moment it would be a pacifist ending but I loved how the Manager got an acid blast on his face.
what classes (and subclasses) where you
Is it just me or is alpharads character just like Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet
OH MY GOD ITS VOX MAKINA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
loved this video !!!
I've wanted to play DND for the longest time but I'm just so *intimidated* by it all. The die, the lore, the characters, everything. But I love playing RPG games and I especially love high fantasy settings. I just need like a really patient teacher to explain shit to me like I'm 5, or like a summary or DND guide for dummies.
Cornyyy
Would Love to see you all as guests on Dungeons&Daddies (not a bdsm podcast)
DEPRSSION!!!!!! “turns sad”
Some things that were left out that I loved: They held a memorial for Gobble Gob, complete with a full prayer for his family. Paul got inspiration for this Zoot had a bird familiar that was very down for murder The riddle door got so fed up with them trying to eat clay that he came back to yell att Tholomewl and Zoot When Tholomewl went mad because of the crown, they started pointing at Zoot and Paul and said that they were their neighbor, metaphorically  The penguin kept calling Paul dad. No other clay thing did this, just the penguin Zoot accidentally made a deal with the devil, and he showed up during the goblin battle to try and get the wand Zoot literally flipped a coin with the devil for the stick, and of course lost because it's Jaiden Paul got depressed after the death of Gobble Gob While Zoot and Tholomewl attacked Mark, Paul attempted to call HR about it, but he had no service
i love you jaiden! ur my fav yubtubr, also HIT THE GRIDDY!!!!
Poor mark 15:26
I LOVED IT, THANK YOU!
I love all of the character styles lol. This was hilarious.
Boop Zoot's snoot
Great video ❤
I love this
They needed Magic the Noah to be the dungeon master
Never unsubscribe so fast
Was this a "One-shot"? Or would the next session continue after this one?
That critical role reference at the tavern tho
That was awesome lol DnD gets wild
Wow, I was able to feel fun and joy fot 17 min , pls more
This game can get pretty awesome and entertaining... until someone decides to make the bag of holding a "Reality-Breaking" bomb and make half the city go into the astral plane, either you end the campaign right there or you new mission is to escape the astral plane.
That's so neat, I love playing DND the parties I've been playing with are great
This video is chaotic, as Dnd should be. I'm so glad you enjoyed playing! I also loved the Vox Machina reference in the beginning.
So one time playing DND ( it was like my 4th time playing ) we were in some random town that seemed mostly abandoned so I cast fireball on a random building to see what happened....  Turns out it was an orphanage. RiP the 93 tiefling babies and their dwarvish caretaker. o7
Please do this againnnn
All the Over the Garden Wall references made my day.
Can someone tell me how to watch the stream where they do that?
As a Walmart associate the bbeg wearing a Walmart vest hits way too close to home..... I love it
Just watched this video and it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
obsessed with "so long, gay bowser" as a verb
Man, the slow realization that this was the whole Acid Breath story...  This was AMAZING!
This was brilliant
If you were too allow homebrew in the campaign that could add 20 layers of chaos already upon this phsycotic campaign great video jaiden can’t wait for the next one
One of us... One of us... One of us...
Absolutely love the box machina reference in the opening
Digica or cybersleuth? pls
More of this pls
if only i could finish EVEN ONE CAMPAIGN OF THIS GAME
Ending song?
Every group goes their own way with D&D. This looked like it would have been a stupidly fun evening. Glad you had a lot of fun and hope to see more like this in future!
Bro got depression from the word depression
You know me and my buddies played a very similar campaign
I must say when the Dragonborn used disguise self to get close I was thinking “acid breath pls” in my head cause I’ve done that exact same thing before lol also “depression” will now be a new tool in my arsenal never thought about it till now lol
FINALY! AN ANIMATION! I miss it! Also I'am the only fan in Turkey?
This.. THIS. TOP TEIR. Please, do more of this!
Is this "A Wild Sheep Chase"?  Edit: No, no it is not.  Edit 2: Wait... Yes it is! 😮
This would’ve been fun
so, hey... new sub hahaha
This is awesome!
Paul is Larry coded from Pokémon
Can we just appreciate that Ranboo and Alpharad’s characters both have enemies and want to search for them whilst on their journey and Jaiden’s Character is just enjoying life and giving people turtles.
That was a rollercoaster off emotions. Wish I could find a DND group to play the game.
Yes a jaiden video  I love it
I've never played D&D, but it sounds like something I might play one day.
Apparently even jaiden ships vexleth
CITY TRIAL THEME LETS GOOOOO! I thought it was my ring tone lmao.
I play DND it's awesome
THAT SUBSCRIBE REQUEST IM CRYING 😭
ХАПХПХАХПХАХ, ЭТО ТАК ЗАБАВНО,  ТОЖЕ ХОЧУ ПОЛИГРАТЬ В DND XD
THEY COOKED THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE 9:50
I was on a vacation over the weekend with family and never got the chance to watch this video until today, and OH BOY WAS THE WAIT WORTH IT! Barely a minute in AND THERE'S A CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE! This is a video I never knew I needed but hot DAMN is it SO PERFECT ALREADY! Can't wait to watch Charlie's reaction video immediately after this! Also, imagine if you guys had a whole series for this that you could stream? That'd be epic. owo
It's womrin' time!!
Incredible
Love the hint of Vox Machina in the back ground!! Love your video!!
"DON'T LISTEN TO HIM! HE'S A ZEBRA!"
Damn that battle had the highest rolls in any session I’ve had 🗿
I loved this it was so cute
Jaiden could make an entire channel of D&D animations
The day this was posted I was out and about with people who played DND a lot and we talked about that near the beginning. Later during the day, we talked about animation, and you came up as my favorite. I open YouTube and what do I find but this video. I had to check if this was a simulation after that.
Using depression as a command is a brilliant use of that spell
7:46 dam. We had the same thoughst, huh?
Make a season 2 dnd
Pls Jaiden more dnd more
Paul is basically Larry from Pokémon S&V
5:22 there was a hidden fart sound effect as paul was cast into a zebra
Am I tripping or do you sound different
Stranger Things moment
So, 2 minutes in and Nanami from JJK has appeared. I can already tell the campaign was awesome.
I gasped when Luap was Paul jr
VOX MACHINA!!!!!
so cool!
Okay but honestly? That time loop thing has me thinking XD You've been stuck in a time loop for years now, only slight changes happening because of slightly different movements or interactions you make every time, and suddenly *two completely new people show up in the loop that you have never seen before*. Imagine going through the whole campaign and your DM is evil enough to say to you:  "You go to bed, exhausted but happy that the BBEG is defeated, excited to see where your next journey will take you. You close your eyes, drift off to sleep, and just as quickly, you slowly blink awake. You are in a familiarr room, but you haven't been here in months/years. You bolt up in your bed and frantically look around, shoving aside the curtain on the window to see whats outside. You see the same view you have seen over and over and over again for many years. You are back in your room at The Old Oak Inn, and the loop begins again". On second thought, I think I wont go the time loop route....... Oooor if I do I'll make a note to break the loop XD
Oh my God you draw animals so scrunkily.
I LOVED THIS ,the amount of cartoon reference's such as the tiny violin and the pig from adventure time and "glob" ❤❤😂😂❤this was epic kinda wished this was a show with Charlie and everyone voice acting thier characters
THIS IS SO COOL
I love how Jacob's character took so much inspiration from Larry! This was one hell of a story. DND has always looked so cool and interesting, I hope one day I get to try it out! Especially animating a DND story makes it even better this was a blast!
Hay man, I love this a lot! Brilliant story! Such fun role playing! I would love to see more!! It would be totally cool to see livestreams of your sessions.
This sounds like a good anime plot, i like it
wow this video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
What makes this great is Jaiden was the biggest menace out of every character here and it was just amazing
1:14 THOSE ARE THE VOX MACHINA!
I wanna know more about Paul Jr. The turtle
my friends are really into dnd but I have no clue how to play. Could someone explain it to me
Our tiny wizard lizard guy just turned a huge robot into a rat. Then proceeded to make a being who previously knew no fear or pain have an existential crisis and now will fear him even after he turns back into a giant robot. Fun times.
Is Paul really the accountant barbarian??? 😂
Jaiden as a dragon is so ace-coded  Oh wait
Good God Ranbu sucks
Am I the only one who low key feels bad for Mark 😢
The moment Tholomew slid up behind the other two a truck started beeping near my house, so I thought the beeping noise was just part of the video and Tholomew just made that noise
I NEED MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAR!!!!
Wow, that horse is great 10:41
why duess the ending of this remind me of the ending in helluva boss season one episode 2
Oh wow!
Genuinely, wtf is this campaign?
This gave adventure time vibes
When will you marry ?
Ngl, Paul reminds me of Nanami from Jjk
14:07 Hey, its my actual DND name! Im not even kidding either, im a half orc ranger called Depression, level 5 because our party keeps forgetting to level up our characters after battles
this is awesome.
This was so fun to watch I hope you continue this as a series and have more crazy adventures with this unhinged band of misfits!
My friends and I got together a month ago with the plan of starting a game of dnd. Three get togethers later and we have successfully made our characters and world and haven’t even begun playing.
I was like this sheep thing sounds familiar. i popped into the stream for a minute LOL
PLEASE do a session 2!!!!
make moreeeeee
is the door bryson? (from haminations)
I can't believe you hit the man with the Power Word: Sad
the detail in 9:13 lol I love this emote
Loved it!
sounds like a great one shot
I’m laughing at how much Paul reminds me of Larry. This was amazing!!! I love DND content!
I unsubed
I find Paul to be very relatable and I'm inspired to start writing again. I can't wait to see it through.
Y'know, from the little i know of DnD besides hearing about it and hearing astral spiff say his friends and him played it and one of them had nipple lasers, I'd say a cat, dragon and assistant manager at a medieval walmart fits in perfectly to whatever is happening.
I love the video! Your gaming videos are always so interesting and fun to wach!
This, this was the video that finally got me to subscribe. My God I killed over laughing with that acid blast to the face. Hope to see more d&d/Pathfinder videos like this soon 😊
THAT CLAY PUZZLE IS RAAAAAAAD. I'M TOTALLY GONNA FIND A WAY TO INCORPORATE IT INTO MY CAMPAIGN.
The fact Jacob was Larry from s&v it hit me as SOON As it was on screen
OMG I LOVED TH3 3ND HAHAHAHA I WANT MORE IF POSSIBLE :D
I belive the first time I played, I murdered a unkillable character in cold blood who was trashing the town a touch, then tired to sell the corpse. So to say I had fun is a understatement.
what happen to Paul Jr the turtle? It went missing like 2nd half of the story
Wait wait wait wait is alpharad just Larry?
Did we just miss where zoot transforms into his ex wife, then proceeded to make him open up, just to be blasted with acid to mentally and physically destroy him
I have never laughed so much. Please more
DID JACOB MAKE HIS CHARACTER LARRY !?! XD
And then I started making my DND universe just because
So, Jaiden Is Her Son (Bobby)  Ranboo Is a CatBoy And Alphard is Larry from Pokemon
Jaiden continues to be too pure for this platform, being all insecure about asking for people to subscribe
Please do more!!! i would so watch a livestream! 😂😂
this was so entertaining i love seeing dnd come to life
4:15 FEED THE LANTERN
Imagine getting Coconut Mall'd by a sheep that smashes through a pub window...
Cool! I’ve deafeated a beholder
I need more of this 😂😂
Only jaiden would put her first "subscribe" message in a way that also tells a portion of her viewers to UNSUBSCRIBE. We love you Jaiden.
SUDDENLY A SHEEP CRASHES THROUGH THE TAVERN WINDOW AND STARTS RAMPAGING AROUND THE INN!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I would love to watch a channel with only videos like this one❤️ I was almost screaming when I saw the title!!!
If its possible, please make another animation about you're other DND adventures
Only if you had gotten @DingoDoodles to do this cuz they entire brand is DND animations
threw a dagger since they didn't what to deal with any more riddles then proceeded to eat the clay never had that come up in a DnD campaign before
PLEASE MAKE MORE OF THESE THIS WAS SO ENTERTAINGGGGGGGGGG
that time sparrow (my friends character) licked a poisonous door which turned their tears into poison which they then fed to a mimick poisoning it
The best d&d story ever told. 👍
I CAGUHT THAT VOX MOCHINA REFERENCE AT THE START
This is one of the silliest and coolest campaigns I've ever seen. Perfect for newcomers!!!
Anyone else see the Vax Machina easter egg
first time ranboo's the short one of the group
Ok now I'm interested in D&D.
Adventure, time 10:39 👈
It's wormin time!!!!!!!
Jaiden was not at the Big Oak Inn…  She was at Coconut Mall
Please more videos like this this is awesome
7 seasons and a movie!
I am a dm myself I love seeing first timers playing
I genuinely can't imagine Zoot not showing up in the next video's patron/fan art section.  The design is adorable.  (Also, according to Charlie's video, Zoot had a bird familiar which was basically intrusive thoughts aviafied, that didn't show up here)
Again!! Pls!!!
i love how you can see 4 of the characters from 'The Legend of Vox Machina' at 1:15
The fact that Paul threw his own son twice is hilarious.
Alphards character just being Larry from SV with an axe is sending me JDNCND
Thank you thank you thank you for including vox machina.
Imagine her second game being on critical role.
I saw an Over The Garden Wall reference, perfect for october <3
Oh man I love that scenario with the Shapeshifter Sheep. I was planning to do this one with my sister for last christmas and never had the opportunity Sadge
I love DnD 😂
So far, best video ever 👑👑👑😊
then he said "it's wormin time" then wormed all over the place
I love this 14:09
This is the most insane dnd session that I have ever seen and I am all in for it oh my goodness
THE KIRBY MUSIC WHY IS EVERYONE IGNORING IT😊
I SEE THAT CRITICAL ROLL REFERENCE! (Watch the show it’s really good they made a tv show)
16:04 probably my favorite line in the video lol. Felt so personal like a action show
damn good campaign
Play moreeeeeeee
You should wait and see what happen when 3 ogres are in 10x10 room at the same time

I beg you Jaiden. Do more sessions with your friends. This is madness incarnate and we all love it
D&D CHAIN. 👇🏾
My fellow nerds unite
The yellow name tag implies Mark is a minor.
I'm literally playing it right now
Ok so I don't know how much overlap there is with the Jaiden followers and the critical role community, but is no one gonna talk about the cameo from keyleth, pike, vex, and grog in the opening scene at the inn? Also please keep playing dnd and making more videos like this, preferably as a series. We love watching people play dnd, and we love getting to see it animated.
15:28 i fucking lost it right here 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
THAT WAS AWESOME!!!!! Do more please.
Vox machina!? WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
I need to know how and where to play this. It looks like fun.
Loved this video
Yo!!!  Vox Machina!!! Good reference
Guess we are just gonna skip the fact that critical role's vox machina made an appearance within the first 2 mins?
I love how the dragon race has multiple types of dragons and that jaiden had picked the one with acid
I wish i had friends that like dnd. I always wanted to try playing but none of my friends wants to even give it a chance
A great story with incredible animations!
This has to be series 😂😂😂
0:56 he's Larry holy shit
Jaiden una pregunta que habla en español por qué está forzada pero que pasó con tu Pájaro y otra cosa vos sabés que te hacen famdubs en español? nada eso buen canal
Is that the one derpy horse from adventure time that the goblins have cooking above the fire?? Love that 10:15
I rlly like the videos topic abt d and d! However i have a question, what was the name of the last song where luap turns into human?
Jaiden with background music is a fantastic experience
Deadass, that Luap naming... Is just a genius stroke
Love that alpharad is the Normal-typed gymleader/elite 4 guy.  "The alphabet goes from a to c" "no it doesn't!" "but I go from c to a. What am I?" "The letter B"
This is great😂  I hope Jaiden play more DnD😂
Jaiden turned into a furry =))
brooo i waited years to comment and now i can now!
This was great can you play another I would like to hear the story
Should you keep playing, I would 100% make any follow up animations you do of this
Okay, mark the manager sure is a villain of a boss battle.
THE OVER THE GARDEN WALL REFERENCESS
The Outset Island theme couldn’t have been a better transition song into the story 👌
OMG THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE
15:27 FATALITY
1:40 bro is Yoshikage kira
Yo Jaden. I got a video idea for you. How about you bring a Pokemon fan game is call. Pokemon infinite fusion.  And please choose my video idea.
BRO IT'S LIKE I WATCHED A MOVIE!!!
I love that alpharad’s character was just Larry- 😂
I want to play it but I can’t because I don’t have any friends who wants to (update) IM ABOUT YO START MY FIRST CAMPAIGN YIPPPEEEEEE
MORE OF THESE VIDEOS PLEASE
The Chulk
15:20 AAAAHHHH THIS WAS SO FUNNY
When the dungeon master smiles, it's all over.
Just  going to point out the asexual is playing the purple dragon  I see what you did there
Not gonna lie but is alpharad the normal paldea gym leader
Dang, DEPRESSION is kinda op in this one!
Emirichu hahah stop cafe hopping and play DnD with Jaiden lol
Me and my party killed basically everyone we saw. At the end of the campaign all of the dead people we killed souls became 1 being, a big blob. There was only one way we could kill it, the same way we killed our 1st enemy, shoving it in a river and striking it with lightning
I imagine that was a fever dream and a half
How do you even play it I don’t understand but I really want to play it at some point
That was Epic
Please pleaaase session 2 with more characters TT it was so so fun
I LOVE LOVM *The Legend of Vox Machina)
Концовка прекрасна!!! Я даже слезу пустил 🤧
Great session!
Ofc Alpha would RP as Larry 😆😂🤣
Jaiden and her friend turn into furry looking animal what can we do ?   Furry : well , there is nothing we can do
This was great to watch since I also started playing dnd this year and as you said it’s an amazing experience
I would love to see more of the D&D campaign! This group sounds so chaotic
I love D and D
A whole universe of possibilities was open to Alpha and he chose to play a Wal-Mart assistant mannager.  I love it.
VOX MACHINA!!!!
This was a masterpiece of a dnd session now I’m excited for my session today! I’m ready to catch hands with my monk!
I simple being. I see ranboo, I click. I see jaiden animations, I let out a little screech, and I click.
nah bro, alfarad done turned into pokemon scarlet normal type gym boss.
17:10 Gotta love foreshadowing
I like Dnd but never tried it
This already looked awesome way of telling about D&D experience and then Vox machina cameo happened. 😁😁
You know Jaiden, I thought up were gonna suplex mark… BUT JUST ACID BLAST TO THE FACE WAS BETTER THAN I IMAGINED
9:53 ADVENTURE TIME HORSE
yo my favourite channels cross-over!! love sniss, love minnmax <3
Why didn't he just say avada kedavra
Using command to cast depression is such a first time player move i love it!!
THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE!!!
YOOO THE FUCKING TWIST!!!!! ITS SO COOL!
the one where jaiden became the managers wife and then proceed to acid blast him got me
YOO ANOTHER JAIDEN ANIMATION
This was amazing! Please do more!
We need the next session video love this first one😂😂
Is it just me or does Paul remind you of Higaruma from Jujutsu Kaisen?
paul a dilf ngl
The first DND games are always unhinged 😂
9:51  Adventure Time: "The Eyes"
The Vox machina cameo in the tavern really made me happy, let's hope there will be more of these (maybe not animated cuz that's a lot of work)
Fun fact:everyone name is paul jr
13:30 I totally thought he was just gonna say, "GET BACK TO WORK!"
We need an episode of everything hates paul💀
i love this. youre awesome. goodnight :L
-15 Employabillity FUCKING killed me
I have a funny story, well, a couple actually. In my first session, we fought an owl bear, after we brutally killed it, I decided that we should eat it, so we did. Also we were interrogating this one guy once and I took off his sock and slapped him in the face with it. I also yeeted a goblin, it was fun
More. Enough said
Did you know this crown is a easter egg of a certain fallen minecraft legend 7:58
I love playing dnd w my friends!😃
I would love to see more videos like this.
I had high hopes for a D&D video from your production, Jaiden. And yet, you have outdone yourself!
never have I considered using "DEPRESSION" as my command command. I think this counts as a magical war crime and I HAVE stashed it away for later use
this was awesome!
This was so fun, subscribe:)
jaiden did u do more sashens after that? if so can you make more videos  about it
That was a goofy DnD adventure 😂
Haha okay that was so silly and fun! I so hope you and your friends do more of these because this story was nuts and I love it!  Also is there by chance room for one more? Out of curiosity
Gotta love a good old wild sheep chase. Never fails to introduce new players. :D
Paul being the D&D version of Larry from Pokemon is too perfect! 😂
Yays
Soooooo amazing!!
I really hope you end up doing more DnD videos as this was an absolute joy to watch.
You can really tell charlie was god here.
Awesome session! Crazy fun is always the best :D  I am running Curse of Strahd (Dark Vampire Adventure) with my group atm. And they met the BBEG at level 3 and the warlock mangaged to stab him with a silver dagger against all odds.  He starts sprinting with the BBEGs back turned towards the group. The wizard casts charm person to stop her but she rolls the save. The druid then casts vines from the floor to hold her, Nat 20 save... She then jump attacks! Misses...but uses an inspiration and hits past his AC and plunges the dagger in his neck.  Such an epic moment...which now makes me afraid to run encounters against the almighty Simon the Warlock ❤😅❤
INSTANT like
The vox machina cameo was perfect
More! More!
This look fun
As a beginner dnd player myself, watching someone else's first is so hilarious. Why does Jaiden's character have a spell circle on her tongue doe
Im sorry but...does anyone else think "Paul" or Alpharad, looks like Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet?
That was awesome 🎉🎉🎉
You know it’s a good day when you see that Jayden has posted 😌
Oh my gosh 🤦‍♂️ That was awesome 🤩
This is one of the most chaotic dnd sessions I’ve witnessed, I love it
hey ex machina cameo
You had me at “DUNGEONS & DRAGONS”!…oh wait
This is so creative! Slime is such a good dm for being able to turn those clay things into monsters so quickly
this was so cool
playing D&D sounds boring to me but the recaps of the games are almost always great
...so you all played as Chaotic Undead ....that didn't know they were dead trapped in the work-friend zone... you are the Äfter-Party Party
wait wait wait... why is Vox Machina in that inn? :D Loved the reference! Keep up playing D&D, you're gonna love it!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ADVENTUREE TIME HORSE
I, too, broke character at "Point Blank"🪱
the acid blast to the face killed me, i was actually starting to feel bad for Mark— also “would you still let me be your manager if i was a worm??” is SO charlie slimecicle im wheezing
THE WIFE AND KID HAHA
Jaiden you fool you gave your dragonborn a tail now all the weirdos are going to come to your video to complain about lore accuracy.
OH GOD PLEASE NO
That was psycho move Jaiden
The Scaley, Larry and The Furry LOL!!!!
poor paul
DAMN THIS WAS AMAZING HAHAHAH
Hehe the poo brain horse from adevetue time made me smile 😊
Yaaaaaaa I loved this I hope you do stuff like this I'm the new years like 2024,2025 stuff like that
Another session! Another session! For the love of the pantheons, we need another!
Paul looks like Larry from Scarlett and Violet love it 1000/10
My guess on what class they are is Alpharad: fighter or berserker Jaiden: mage or warlock Ranboo: bard
This was absolutely amazing!! I loved this video so much!!!!
Goody ah nerd
jaiden guest cameo in JRWI when?
4:52 pov: what was missing from adventure time
Totally missed the chance to have Mark say "can you come in on Wednesday" to paul
Pssst if you want to play a hidden gem of a game on the Nintendo DS play legendary starfy!
As someone who loves dnd I gotta say your specific art style lends itself well to dnd if you made a campaign playlist for dnd I’d binge the whole thing
laughed so hard i cried. classic dnd. 10/10 video
alpharads character looks like Larry
i want a plush of the ranboo cat.
alpharad's luck seems to transfer to any game
OMGGGG LOVVVVEEEEE you animating the story and i legit just did my first every DnD game 2 days ago!! and it was AWSOMEEEE!!!!!!  OH I HOPE!!! you do more of these!!! even if its like once a month or, every 2 month!! IDC I WANNTTTT <3 <3 OvO
This was absolutely the best video I’ve seen in years. I need more of this. 20/10.
Play with me and you’ll realize that im more chaotic
I lost it when Zoot acid blasted
I caused a minotaur to commit suicide once
As someone who as never even heard of DnD in my 19 years of life, can someone explain what it is and where I can play it.
Sounds like an average dnd experience
Love the reference to Vox Machina
Season 2!!! But the players voice act their own character???
OMG the "your my personal hell" was amazing
This is not what I expected from a Jaiden animations video
Yes Jaiden join us
Duuude using the music from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga was such a good choice. That's like my favorite GBA game ever.
More......MOAR!!! For real though we all loved this and wanna see more. Also idr where to watch the original stream for the D&D i do remember seeing it at some point. Wonder if you guys continued any further.
this is why i love dnd, you can make the craziest stuff happen, or put emense amounts of trauma into your characters, not that ive ever done that, haha...
Turtle FINAL ANSW...!  killed me
This should be a series
Idk who paul or fall out cat
Are we just gonna ignore that paul threw his son across a room twice??
I want Paul LMAOOO😻
Paul is Lary from scarlet and violet
the superstar saga music just fits with all the chaos ensuing each time
Omg the superstar saga music brought me back
Honestly love this for the insanity. My last heist my party did went too well. I mean, for that very reason it was chaos incarnate, but that we pulled it off without a hitch was a miracle, which almost any dnd player can tell you. These things almost always never go as planned. Maybe it’s because we didn’t really plan pretty much anything. The most planning we did was splitting into two groups, one to sneak in, one to head to the front door and make a distraction….and boy did we! We just waltzed in the front door and told the people to give us a drink. Which they did…for one of us. Lol and then war stories from my distraction team partner which had the guards all distracted whilst I did things that helped the sneaky team get to our target and eventually unlock it by herding around the guards. As for my partner…he ended up seducing the leader and that went way better than we thought it would since charisma is his dump stat lol (why we sent in the lowest charisma ones is confusing to me). Anyway, so yeah, we break out our target and then all heck breaks loose and distraction team (of which I’m on) manages to still trick the enemies right up until we have to attack to make sure our team can fully get out. It’s hilarious. Now the funny part is that the leader, who has a grudge against our cleric, has a (unrequited) crush now on our monk (the seducer). And the enemies are still convinced I’m some paid bodyguard for the guy who only attacked because my charge did. Boy are they wrong! Lol it was personal (the enemies kidnapped a friend). Anyway, my character got tons of info and now I’m reporting it back to my faction with pictures because my character is basically like one of those perp artists. Already drew a detailed picture of the camp and is in the process of drawing all the faces. Basically the worst person you want to know your face if you are trying to do a secret operation. But yeah, the fact that we all escaped and got away is amazing. I’m sure it will bite us later however. We did kinda let some evil pixies summon their evil queen to the material plane….because it was more important to us to rescue who we were there for…which was fair I think. Ah well. Should be interesting since the evil queen is connected to monk and his backstory. Honestly dnd is chaotic and I love it.
WHAT A FREAKING STORY
Anyone else notice jaiden’s demon bird was just cut out of this version
What this is the first time-
1:52 yoooo deadbeat boulevard reference
i was legit just saying this in the morning, before i die i need to play it once
Who needs its morbin time we got it’s worming time
This was amazing!!!
This is cool because I just got into d&d at my school and our campaign is super unhinged. I rolled a nat-20 for convincing the rat kit I didn't kill his rat when I sliced one in half
Absolutely amazing! Makes me want to get back into DND 😰😁
This is so unhinged, and I love it.
So many references but the most obscure/specific one i got was probably the horse from adventure time on the goblins camp
Jacobs character was giving off extreme yoshikage kira vibes,id fucking run if someone did that to me
I am a moderately nerdy person and always wanted to like DnD, but I just do not enjoy it. Not liking it makes me feel like an outsider. Hearing you just flat-out say I should unsubscribe just kind of sucks to hear. Anyway, there's my shit opinion.
I KNOW DAMN WELL I SAW BEAST FROM OVER THE GARDEN WALL AT 4:17
2:27 Am I weird for saying that Random Female Waiter Orc is actually kinda cute (And im gonna say it I think she looks beautiful)
y'all should make this an episodic series
you cant be a dragonborn having a seemingly sweet moment without element breathing/spitting directly into the opponents face
I'm still learning about DnD and I have recently played DnD but it's Alien DnD. I do want to learn more about it and I can see that the adventure that you had looked awesome and I can't wait to learn more about DnD for my end.
Fk yes I love dnd           ALSO I KNEW I SUBBED TO THE RIGHT PERSON
i have seen no comment mentioning the Vox Machina easter egg.
Crazy you haven’t heard crazy I once DESTROYED THE MULTIVERSE
Amazing amounts of unhingedness, love it
Would love to see a Baulders gate 3 episode
That was so much fun to watch, bring more videos like that. I love it, and especially with your effort put into the animation <3
This video was actually trashh 😢
doe's anyone knows what the music at the end was? thanks! anyways BEAUTIFUL animation! i love the story and hope you make more!
I love dnd, My current character froze an evil Theseus piercing him then shattering him.
Her voice is so soothing
wait the way this made me want to do this
Based Dragonborn player.
Anyone else fully anticipated that when Jaiden transformmed into the ex wife of fhe baddie and pulled him in for a hug, anticipated the point blank acid breath spray but still laugh at it anyways?
At first, I immediately thought "OK, who the heck had the idea to eat clay?! Was it Zoot?!" But then I remembered my very first, still ongoing, experience in DnD, and my own character, Jack. I never intended him to be a weirdo or an idiot, but this guy is steadily growing a list of "Jack's weird and dumb ideas" as I would call it. This is a man who believed he could survive a jump from a 10 or 15 foot tall structure, at *level 2.* To my credit though, I also thought it was a good idea until my DM literally talked me off the ledge. I'm honestly surprised Jack isn't dead by now. Not because our first boss fight was unintentionally brutally hard, but because of Jack's own bad decisions.  So yeah, long story short, Jaiden is relatable to me here. Loved the video. Had many laughs. lol
The caption actually told me“It’s like a bored game without the board” 💀
LEGEND OF VIX MACHINE!!!!
I adore this and it makes me so appreciative of my dnd friends.
:)
I need to get into DnD
you are lucky i wasn't dm jaiden
I love how Paul is just Larry
Dungeons and dragons is so nerdy
this is the best D&D cintent i have ever seen, this has so much quality, i would love to see move videos with this style, you truly out did yourself this time
I have been watching your channel for a while and had not sub. This content was so good that I had to sub. Please make more of this.
Oh my gosh. The character design was so spot on for everybody’s personalities, and the animation was just 🤌
3 minutes in, I can tell Paul is the real star already lol
I've watched this at least 27 times and its still good
This video made me a different type of high
The Paul and Paul Jr reunion though...🥲
WE NEED MORE DND ANIMATED JAYDEN VIDEOSSSS
IVE DONE THIS CAMPAIGN BEFORE!!! ITS GREAT!
This whole event on the subathon was so much fun to watch😂
Is that drum part at 11:22 the beginning of Cecilia?
I’m so happy this exists! So good ❤ would love a sequal!
WHEN DID JADIEN AND RANBOO BECOME BUDDIES?? I swear the spread of the minecraft youtubers to other channels is crazy 😅
was that a fart sound effect at the riddle door transformation thing
Paul looks like sangi
Why was Alpharad just Larry lol
I played my first D and D game a day ago
jaiden should do a randomized nuzlocke it be pretty funny to see what happens
This is what dreams feel like
The shrek reference right off the bat was beautiful
a Vox Machina reference, I see you 😏👍
U know ur group is crazy when u catch the GM off guard lmao 🤣
The real villain of the story: walmart
Why is the horse from adventure time episode “the eyes” dead in the camp
Why was alpha just Larry from pokemon😅
That story has one HUGE plot hole. Mark works at Wal-Mart but has never had depression before? I'm not buying it.
I’m curious to know how many of these were critical fails.  It feels like there were a lot at the start.
Who else saw Keyleth, Vex, Pike, and Grog in the Old Oak Inn?
Me when I first saw the title: “Well this will be fun”
Im guessing a barbarian, druid, and a bard.
that was cool
What if Paul is just some guy who got Isekaied?
What were their classes by the way?
Bro its been a long time since ive laughed that hard and long watching yt always a go to thanks for the content
12:27 song name please
ITS A TABAXI NOT JUST A CAT
AYYY VX MACHINA
You can not just do anything in D&D.
No regrets clicking on this video
Man I love the fact that you used Larry from scarlet and violet as a base for Alpharad’s character
And also you use a board a lot actually, maybe not in your campaign.
I LOVE DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Ah yes a fellow Dragonborn
I love all of the OTGW references there were in this vid
1:16 I wasn't expecting to see a Vox Machina reference
15:20 is the funniest thing I’ve seen in a month. God that was amazing.
Paul reminds me of like a less normal Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
that was so fun, please do more of these
YOO WITH SLIMECICLE THATS crazy...
Make more of these ❤❤
The beast has found a new forest apearlty (I loved his inclusion in the background along with ice kings horse costume)
Haha i watched this live! Remembering details right before they happen was hilarious
hello purple dragon it is i roze golden strike human barbarian it is a pleasure to meet you i hear yopu are a friend amongst many and as an honor i shall gift you a tome of magic casting to aid you in your many quests let this be a valuable item that will assist you in many days to come on your various adventures
love the vox machina reference
I love paul being this average man who's just randomly a badass😂
THE CAT HAS A FUCKING BAGPIPE HE IS ONE OF US 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿  ONE OF US 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ONE OF US 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ONE OF US 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ONE OF US 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ONE OF US 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ONE OF US 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ONE OF US 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 ONE OF US 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I don’t usually comment, but I haven’t seen anyone mention all the references in this video yet! Vox Machina and The Beast from OtGW are the two that I noticed! Love it!
Love the Critical Roll reference!
My dungeon, master kind of ruined my first time playing DND bc she would never start it when every one was available.
loved the video  🥰🤩🤩🤩
I normally love when J uploads. And I’m a huge D&D fan. But this one missed for me. Still liked the video tho! ♥️
i have played before too. Its so fun!
Paul looks like a depressed Sanji from One peice
My middle school has a dnd club and I can safely say this feels insanely tame in comparison to the stuff that went on there
I’d like to think that all of the accidents that happen weren’t scripted,but rather slimecicle being so disappointed in their combat that in fear of a team wipe,last minute scheduled the scenario
Awesome!! Whats the song that plays at the end?
I haven't seen anyone talk about the OTGW reference about the turtles name hehe "Wirt" "mr president" "greg" "benjamin franklin" and the shadow of the beast in the forest when she was talking about "noticing various animals in the woods"...I love OTGW so much.
we have susie from deltarune, a furry, and the normal type gym leader from pokemon scarlet and violet
The tongue-tattoo is such an awesome idea for a warlock character XD
My character made a deal with a racoon to give him magic pigments for equipment
☻/ /▌ / \ Heh heh funny. :)
i need to see another one of these🤣🤣🤣🤣
Stat blocks 🙏 PLEASE
So quick story my dads freind made a magic item for d&d homebrew called the death blossom wand where it fires 40 magic missiles all at once than explodes
please I want more Adventures of this especially animated also would it be funny if the Fool's Gold Series ever meet up with this series
Love the Vox Machina cameo 1:15 and the whole session
Jaiden you better not be a furry
13:05 - 13:11 is that a undertale refrence
Please do more this was fantastic to watch
For somebody who's been living the same day for the past three years... why wouldn't you mention that a rampaging sheep was about to turn up
"so long gay bowser's the sheep" is my favorite line now
THE POKEMON RANGER MUSIC LMAOOOOO
I understood that reference! (Vox Machina in the bg, lol.)
Nice take on the wild sheep chase @Slimecicle Command word "depression" sent me @aydenanimations 😂😂
Is it me or is it completely fine to see ranboo as a furry
My boi Charlie known in some places as slimccle
I HAVE NEVER PLAYED D&D BEFORE BUT I WANNA SO BAD AS A LOVER OF THE QSMP JAIDEN RANBOO AND THE OTHERS MADE ME WANNA PLAY IT EVEN MORE
DND is awesome :D
That is the exact kind of character that I would expect from ranboo
I like the character designs.  Paul looks like a blonde Larry from Pokemon. The dragon girl has that cool tongue mark and the cat boy has a fun coat pattern
"Don't listen to him, he's a zebra!"  Good advice.  Zebras cannot be trusted.
OMG I AM JUST ABOUT TO START PLAYING ON THE 19th Too
I think "DEPRESSION" as the use of command is the single funniest use of that spell I've ever seen
Magic💖🔥🎉
There are So Many references! In the forest walking scene there’s the beast (Goat of a villain), The ice king donkey costume in the goblin scene, and a bunch of other shit. This is so good!
Do more
the collective face palm 😭 new sub from me
Remember my first dnd campaign, literally the first turn I took of my first dnd game I rolled a nat 20 and absolutely launched an elderly lady to space
help why does jacobs character look like a divorced father of four 😭😭 I WASNT EVEN THAT FAR OFF LMAO
did anyone else notice she stopped putting that lil jaiden icon in the corner of her thumbnails
1:15 Hey, there's a few familiar faces. Very cool little nod.
1:15 Legend of Vox Machina party :D
I love the fact that when faced with a chance to make a character Alpharad decides to make an even more depressed version of Larry
alright when do we get Zoot fanart?
I want more plz😊. I loved DND when I first played
This is for everything thenlow tax retur
Wait, the 'come on down, and try some corn, or we will sacrifice your newborn' guy was your DM? Also, holy shit, poor Mark Thompson. Jaiden's a stone cold killer.  (How do all these Youtubers know each other???)
Yo more dnd please
Question, what’s happening next?
Omg mark from Walmart 😊
You should make a part 2 of jaiden animations anime
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome   the dice spoke.
1 minute in and there's vox machina this is so great.
That seems like an amazing nonsense oneshot. Also it was nice being able to identify every Nat 1 as the story progressed.
Paul ended up husbando material.
Isn't the thing being cooked by the goblins the horse from adventure time?
I SAW DRAGON, PART 2???
If you weren't the dragonborn, that would've been very dissappointing.  Who cursed the cat if it wasn't Mark?
love that ranboo is basically just a palico from monster hunter
Anyone else notice that Paul literally yeeted his son into a wall?
I’m praying for you Jayden.
Eyy i was a dragonborn when I first started too :D
i gotta try dnd with my friend. him and his brother are obsessed with it, i need to study up before i try it though, cuz i'm a bit nervous
Omg i want to hear the full session now XD is there a podcast or anything??
I subbed as soon as i saw Beaton's shetland pony
I would so be down to watch more of your animation of the DND matches as it was so funny to see how you guys did and perceived it to look like lol
Im in a DnD club so ofc i got excited seeing this :0
That was awesome to see this one shot changed into something completely magical and unique
WHY IS ICE KINGS PONY DISGUISE BEING COOKED????
the ooh when Paul was Loup was hilarious
AYYY THIS WAS SICK I loved the music it really added to the video and yes dnd is great I just got into it at my art school and wow I wish I did it sooner lmao
ME WHEN I AHHHHHHHH
epic ending
I loved the vox machina reference
Me and you would be amazing friends Jaiden
Please do more of this. Please
I played dnd for the first time a while ago and I rolled a 20 for charisma on a goblin and he was giving me 😳 and then my friend rolled a 20 on the same goblin but to stun him so instead of JUST stunning the goblin...  He also stunned me because of the goblin Givin me 😳
Please do a session 2
Okay. This makes a lot more sense knowing Charlie was the DM. a sheep saying “WHY THE **** WOULD YOU TRY TO PEPPER SPRAY ME!!!” Just seems a lot more likely with a guy like that in charge.
Lets fùúûüūůűųking gòóôõöøōőœ  finally a jaiden animation dnd video
Personally when she embraced Mark, I was expecting a Suplex
This was great i would not complain if this became returning content
I have never played the game I have never heard of it I LOVE IT
What happened to Paul Jr?
Am I the only one who thinks alpharads character looks like Larry ?
0:57 Larry Jacob is the best character design i've ever seen
love how Alpha's just blond battleaxe larry
You and your team killed it on this one
very good one shot, im very familiar with it
The fact that i just finished season two of vox machina is perfect
the funnest part 8:23
**Jaiden Loses 12.1M Subscribers**
DND is my personal fav
Goated D&D right here
man ive always wanted to play this but ive been afraid someones gonna make fun of me for it
CRITROLE REFERENCE CRITROLE REFERENCE CRITROLE REFERENCE CRITROLE REFERENCE CRITROLE REFERENCE CRITROLE REFERENCE
I love that alpharad is just a businessman…. with a great axe
Jaiden playing DnD is a masterpiece I didn’t know I needed 😂 more please
I just noticed there was Vox machine in the tavern
this video was great i need moooooooore!!!!
A fruiting cinematic masterpiece
I'm curious about sub classes
I would absolutely love if you did a series of dnd videos, even if it's on your second channel.
The Mark Thompson twist was freaking genius!!!
I love the Vox Machina refrence at the start 😂. Im still waiting for the next season!
OMG The man in the suit approach you with the offer
Why is no one asking the important questions like what happened to the turtle?
A party member of mine seduced a sentient brown bear who was very trustable, the rest of the party beheaded him for liking onepiece
the door seems like it was animated by James idk why i think so it just gives me that vibe
Would love to see more of this
It's crazy how dnd and other TTRPGS have become a whole cultural phenomenon in recent years. It's so incredible to see
i want a sequel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:15 Thank you for the Vox Machina reference. I greatly appreciate it.
1:51 let me guess a rouge
OMG i didnt know dnd could be this epic i always wanted to play it but never got the chance
Is it just me. or does alpharad in the dnd session kinda look like larry from pokemon scarlet and violet
I’m about to play my first game! Super super excited, playing a Lizardfolk blood hunter in a home brew game
Also, I LOVE the wind waker music!!
I LOVE THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE OMG
I am begging, genuinely begging! for another dnd animated!!<3 one of my favorite jayden videos of all time. More of these videos are essential to my health
Truly, an epic tale for the ages.
Oh yeah just casually eating next to Vox Machina lmao I love it
THIS IS THE BEST CROSSOVER EVER
As soon as I saw the title I screamed with excitement!
I want more Jaiden DND PLEASE
NO WAY DID YOU PUT A VOX MACHINA REFERENCE IN that alone deserves a sub
OMGG SLIME
I would without a doubt watch the full video. I don't know if y'all did this in person or over voice, but set up cameras, live this wonderfully unhinged life, and post it. I need to see the in person reactions, there had to have been a few nat 1's rolled up in here (boomerang axe?!). 10/10 a delight.
espresso depresso
Oh my GLOBNESS!!!! I love this video! Such a fun D&D adventure with cute animation characters. Love the Vox Machina and Adventure Time reference in the vid. I want to see more D&D videos. Also... love your character, Jaiden.
*far away*   POGGERS!
oh whats next? tcg? pokemon? yugioh? mtg?
DID I JUST SPOT THE LEGEND OF VOX MACHINA?!?!?
This is great but I tried one time and my party teloported into our world stole guns and made nuclear bombs and an empire called hitpolion and killed all that apposed him😂
16:53 OOOOHHHHHH....
Did I spot a Critical Roll reference in the tavern.  Also this just seems like your normal chaotic DnD session lol
MORE
My character got killed on sunday so this is nice to look at
Well, this DnD campaign was wack!
Jaden you got to make more of these absolutely amazing and funny
Man that was freakin awesome😂
Paul is my new hero lol this man is a legend for not unaliving himself
Loving the choice of music! Especially the Superstar Saga and Kirby stuff
this one time in my campaign i got cut in half by lava gravy
Start a chain of your favorite dnd hijinks! My friend once played a bard, and was surrounded by a ring of fire. She decided to roll to seduce it into not harming her. And rolled a nat 20. The DM said he would only allow it to work if she could come up with a good pickup line. So she approached the fire, and says "You're pretty hot" And it worked.
I think I need to start playing dnd now lol. This was awesome I feel like we could get regular animations whenever you guys play now.
Gooster
Now this, I want more of this please. MORE DND FOR MY NERD BRAIN
Classic funny Jaiden moves Yup, even his personality is giving off Larry vibes. I have no idea about the cat but he's funny The reactions for the acid blast... I love how two of them are laughing and Paul is just like D:< Revenge on the Bronze door is awesome Extra detail of the dragon in the sky, always fun
LETS GO DUNGENS AND DRAGONSSSS!!!!!!!!! ALSO RANBOO❤❤❤
This is the perfect video of all my favorite YouTubers.😮
you do not know HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS
Is it just me or do we have a bad ass dragon that can summon spells and has hair Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet and Cat BTW I have never played the game either, a lot of kids who do in my school get made fun of, (or at least if they join the club), and personally I have never been interested. (Me hinting that I have no friends btw)
the party consist of a dragonborn, a cat person, tired saul good man and a sheep, is enough to convince me to play D&D
THE REACTION OF THE NAME WAS SO NATURAL THAT EVEN I GOT OOOOOO!!! Slime doing good as a DM! I hope you guys will play more, so we can see more of this funny adventure!
Nema in game goostaf
I'm sorry, 1:15 Keyleth Vex Pike and Grog 😂
The acid vom was the cherry on top
Well executed story 🤧
why is zoot a speech user
Anyone else catch the Vox Machina reference at the inn? 😮
nervous lil dragon baby 🥰
Please make a part 2
In a recent session me and my party had a irl 30 minute conversation about a magic toaster we found.
That was amazing! My first session had a member of the party, not me, try and use thunderclap on an Astral Dreadnought they angered. Almost killed his party members, my character and the other part member, and THEN the Astral dreadnought took no time up and killing my friends character in one attack. Mind you, the party was only level one and the dreadnought was like way stronger than us. Now, were like level 2, with my character close to being level three.
I HAD A DREAM ABOUT THIS VIDEO A MONTH AGO OMG!
No Offense but, Why do Jaiden look like Susie From Deltaru-
Do Dragonborn grow hair?
jaiden had embraced furries
As a braindead harbinger of chaos (an idiot player and an idiot dm), D&D is just amazing! I love it so much! I'm happy that you finally got to enjoy it too.
I always love you're videos but this one... was the funniest most unhinged masterpiece I've seen good job.😄
I based my character off of my lizard
I’ve also got recently into dnd hope you enjoy it!
I wanna see this session Just roll With It style This was amazing, even down to you using roar of dedede
"An invisible force they can't see"
Me whos dm’d for 4 years
That was absolutely fantastic! I love hearing new D&D experiences and it is even better coupled with Jaiden's storytelling and animation.
Plz plz make more dnd content
That was fun and weird and cool!
Did anyone else notice Jacob made Larry 2: Paul?
The Kirby Airride City Trials Music during the fight with Mark is the real winner here
the thumbnail
When I heard double or nothing i knew Jaiden was repeating Charlie
I am OBSESSED with DnD! I have been playing Baldur's Gate III every free chance I get, have a campaign with my best homies and Vox Machina is one of my favourite shows (nice reference btw). I think it would be awesome to see Jaiden stream BG3, not sure if the gameplay style is her thing but I think it would be a really fun watch if so.
Watched once, loved it. Watched twice, noticed keyleth, vex, pike, and grog! Loved it even more.
THEI IS SUCH A CROSSOVER
Oh my Gods they all meet in a tavern Also, this is HILARIOUS AND SPECTACULAR!!!
i hope there is a part 2 that will be fire
This should be a series
I love fear and despair  And also big nine headed dragons That you can have relationships with…  And have kids… DND  Wearenotresponsibleforanymentaldamagephysicaldamagepsychologicaldamageanddeathforanyandallreason
ily platonically:D
I feel sorry for that poor door face. It was just trying to do its job.
Do moar!
4:33 over the garden wall
Paul is giving Reigen from mob psycho 100
15:40 Whats The Song Here?
I loved  this o my God do more of this❤❤❤❤❤
Show of hands, who else went "OOOOoooooh" during Luap's reveal?
Wasn't there a devil ending or sum
you should show us a hole video of just playing
I don't know if it was just me. But that door was really hard to understand. Love the video though!
Ok, this looks like the funnest time ever, also, 17 MINUTES ANIMATED VIDEO!? THAT IS SO LONG HOW DO Y’ALL DO IT!! :000
I LOVE THAT DND IS SO COOL AND IM SO GLAD YOUR INTO IN NOW ❤❤❤
I AM PART OF A D&D CLUB AND IT IS SO MUCH FUN.
Paul is basically just Larry from s/v
8:02 why did i perfectly predict this?
The axe in the briefcase tho XD XD
Seeing Charlie portrayed as an evil mastermind will never not be funny to me
my friend is in a campaign where one of the characters is batman but racist
this is just making me want to learn and play dnd.
12:30 music?
This video reminds me of my cat that died today. It really is helping me deal with my sadness. Thank you Jaiden.
Did anyone else understand why the sheep stopped for Paul on the second watch?
Holy. Loved it
There needs to be a second session
I myself am not getting into D&D but I’m planning to start a session with another game in the same role play genre, funny this video came out when it did, right as I am discovering this hobby for myself
I love D&D
hey me and ranboo are both half tabaxis  and i only clicked on this becayse i saw ranboo and charlie
A depressed salaryman is kinda hot
JAIDEN AND DND?!!!! HOLY SHIT I GOTTA WATCH THAT
YYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Zoot and tholamew would make a great band
Seeing Ranboo and Slimecicle in a video from my favourite childhood YouTubers videos felt like a fever dream
omg this was amazingf
Love how mark has the yellow Walmart badge indicating he is under 18 and bald
Omg this is soo good i love all of it im trying to play dnd with my brother and his friends and i been going good this just fuels my creativity even more love tmu i think thats his name please forgive me and correct me if im wrong the little cat. Is soo cute love him. My fav part is jaiden acid blast
I love this video and I love d&d but I have never played it. And I have watched it 3 times now and I will probably watch it 5 more times😅
AND SLIMECICLE
Me (who never played dungeons and dragons) is now realizing that me and my friends' roleplay thing... is just dungeons and dragons in our own weird way... huh..
i adore playing dnd. there's just something about the controlled chaos through the story you get to tell with your party, being able to escape to another world through the silly and the serious. I'm glad that I've gotten good at playing dnd, it's truly helped me explore different aspects of myself :)
was that dragon at the end a reference to the Monkey's Paw DND?
i predicted the plot twist mid way through the video
I love this lol and I hope you played more sessions ❤
For those wondering, this appears to be based on a one shot written by Winghorn Press. It’s called “A Wild Sheep Chase”, you can look it up online. I use it for all my new players
I LOVE D&D
Not me losing it bc my name is Ella and my boyfriend is named Mark. Promise me this isn’t my future I beg you
Yay
We need more video about DND
Can we get more of jaiden playing dnd vids?
A Totaly normal D&D Session XD... Legendary Story and great Animation... i love it. And nice easter egg at the Old Oak Inn XD
I've only played D&D once for like 3 sessions, my character was a blind archer, proceeded to shoot another party member, smashed a healing potion trying to throw it at a dead person and then died, all within about 15 minutes
Nice
I registered Luap as Llwapp, which still works, I guess, lol
Mmor pls
9:51 is that the horse from adventure time season 1 who turns out is ice king??
I'd give anything to watch Jaiden play Warhammer 40K, or Homeworld Revelations, or Steel Battalion, or Armed and Dangerous.
Is it me or does Paul look like Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet
ITS WORMING TIME - slmcll i think
The Mighty Nien drinking in the Old Oak Inn! 😊
OH MY WORD. THIS IS GREAT!! I LOVE DND. I'm a kitty necromancer.
This video was boring. Love your channel but this video was not it. Great Animation tho.
The best part of watching these kinds of videos is relating everything back to similar experiences and catching onto a bunch of the jokes and mechanics that the game produced. Hope you had a lot of fun, Jaiden and friends! This game sure sounded like it!
THIS WENT ON TRENDING
I remember seeing the clips of the last fight and just dying from laughter.
Please do more.
dfaj;lkj;eragnera; I LOVE DND AND I SAW THE VOX MACHINA REFRENCE!~
Ahh the chaos.  Loved every minute of it!
Dnd is so much more fun when you see them animated like so cool not that playing is boring
Dude in the suit.. Larry? Is that you? Shouldn't you be at your Pokemon Gym?
Woah! I did not expect to see a oneshot I’ve considered running before.
Love it when the dm hates you you find a turaske
As a DM I loved seeing the sheep and just having a wave of nostalgia hit me as I remembered the first ever one shot I ran about the polymorphed sheep wizard. Iconic one shot and just brought back so many good nostalgic vibes!
this went incredibly hard
“I cast acid breath”
Awesome! I love this, gonna use the clay puzzle for my games 💪😎
12:03 thats me irl
Sleep being the child doesnt make sense. why call lop and get uppity over it if it's not even ur name.
Aw, gotta love the critical role reference in the old oak inn
Really great to see you've gotten into tabletop games! They've been a really positive force in my life and hoping they'll do the same for you!   ~~Can't wait until she learns about homebrew and the next campaign is set in a pokemon themed setting~~
This video was funny and great and Jaiden is so awesome
I need this to be an anime, like, yesterday.
I played that Campaign before! And we had a wild mage who summoned the country bear jamboree to distract the goblins😂😂
Well that explains that jaiden “animation” a few months back with scuffy 14:44
Larry's canon event? 1:40
Omg it’s wild sheep chase!
9:52 adventure time horse real
HELL YEAH VOX MACHINA
I refuse to believe that they didn't at least try to make clay dildos
GM = game manager 😆
I need a group, anyone in SoCal up for a PG game and able to teach a newbie
plz more i love this
9:51 isnt that the horse from adventure time
I have always wanted to play dungeons and dragons but my friends never wanted to play
DEPRESSION
Damn. I play d&d with friends but we’re more serious about it. Sometimes it’ll have its funny moments but this was super entertaining the whole way through and made me laugh and enjoy the entire video. I need my DM to add more details the same way you guys did. Like the explosion going off as you walk away and the axe doing a boomerang back towards them etc. so funny!! I’m taking notes
12:33 If I had a nickel everytime I watched a DnD stream on YT where the party simultaneously decides at the climax of the campaign to YEET their helpless animal guide at the final objective in the hopes of bringing it down, I would have 2 nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice, right?
Pls we need more D&D content from you scoob
Oh boy dnd is amazingly awesome but scary on how smart you need to be sometimes haha still love it
This was amazing!!! Would love to see more sessions animated
I want this to be a real show
YES I LOVE PLAING DND AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS PLAYED IT
What was the tavern music from? It sounds so familiar
Oh yeah, my lv1 character died within 10 minutes because my city was attacked by 100 skeleton or zombies, and then the NPCs used some large-scale attacks to destroy everything.
ITS ME THE FLUFFY MAREEP CRASHING INTO THE INN FOR THE FUNNY!!!!!
This is without a double my favorite video 😂❤ it was so fun I love it
I love this so much. I am gonna use command: depression. That's the most genius way of using the spell I've heard.
At some point YouTube unsubscribe me from your channel. Very strange. Now to my original comment, why does Paul suspiciously remind me of Larry from Scarlet and Violet?😅
I love that Alpharad was just Larry from Pokemon
Really fun, hope to see more of you playing!
What did I just watch 😄 ?! Even for DnD that's quite the crazy adventure 😄 As many people, i'm eager to a second episode.  Top animation, as always. Thanks for your work !
its also funny that while fighting  the penguin you play dededes theme
Istg the first time i ever heard of DnD was from stranger things i was confused how to play but now that you told your story i wanna play DnD now ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
PLEEEEAAASE MAKE THIS A SERIES
a dragonborn, a bard cat who is stuck in a time loop, larry the normal gym boss from pokemon violet
I’ve always wanted to play dnd and you fueled my love for wanting to play it again
This was spot-on with my D&D experience! In the back of my mind I was noting when people rolled well or poorly based on how the story was going too 😂
I love the Vox Machina reference. That show is great.
The second i heard jaiden beg for subscribes i knew this was a good video
I have plans to Bring YouTube version to Hot Wheels accelerators.
The acid blast to the face got me so good.
I have a head in a sack in D&D
I like how alapharad is just larry from pokemon
Me: about to click subscribe Sub button: Subscribed Me: still clicks it Also me: Clicks it one more time
amazin
One time my friend was playing a wild magic sorcerer in a campaign of my friends (wild magic means that whenever they cast a spell something weird has a chance to happen). They were unlucky enough to roll a 99 on the percentage dice (which means they get 10 more random effects), and they ended up exploding and turning into a sheep, then their skin turned blue, then they became a plant.   My friend exploded into a blue cotton plant within a minute after casting a spell. Welcome to D&D.
The background Mario and Luigi Super star saga battle music and themes worked so well 😂
Please do more of this! This was incredible and so much fun to watch!
14:45
Omg! Jaiden has now played dnd! He'll yeah! Hope you had a blast! And I will confidently say I need more of this, this was an incredible and hilarious video, and I need more jaiden playing dnd. (Also what was everyone's class and race?) Also this is the most chaotic party ever holy gods.
so  dnd can be super outpocket or normal i see
Sounds absolutely like DnD. The most prime DnD experience
OMG!!! THE GREAT HEROES VOX MACHINA!!!!    What a shoutout!❤❤
The Kirby and the forgotten land music made the fight-scenes go so hard.
DND YES
What class ARE UOU
Hands down one of the best d&d quest i’ve heard of ever 😂
Don't forget, eating goblins is good for you.
Dnd is one of the most interesting experiences i ever had, i once killed a hag by using ninteen random effects all on the same turn  Burned, electrocuted, poisoned, frothing from the mouth, being sent tens of feet into the air, only to be teleported off or an cliff all on the same turn, while conjuring three unicorns at the same time
9:51 omg they killed the horse from that one adventure time episode
Dnd campaigns tend to be goofy af, don't let anyone bully you into thinking otherwise XD also love the vox machina cameo <3  edit: long nails make many typos
VEX IN KEYLETH IN THE INN 🥹🥹🥹
Bro leme play dnd with you lol
First time I’ve played (and the only time so far) i was given the wand of wonder and I just recked havoc it was amazing
0mg MOST BEST AMAZING DND IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE UNIVERSE!!!
Can anyone tell me the music that plays at 14:24 please?
Great video!
jaiden is a wild magic sorcerer?
Yooooooo! Vox machina! (Love that detail)
Hey whats the music that plays when paul and Bartholomew did when attacking Bartholomew?
Now the next thing is warhammer 40k !!!!WAAAAAHGG!!!!
I've barely started the video and my god why is there lizard, boring person, and furry already
ok now i need jaiden as a guest on @Dimension20
yo, Wild Sheep Chase! nice
Clay gets put back in the bowls. The average dnd party: yooo bet all you can eat buffet!
Ahhhhhhhhh the Vox Machina easter egg sent me
oh my goodness i loved this!!!!!
The only thing i think would make this better would be to include the dice rolls
I love A Wild Sheep Chase, one of the best one-shots
I love how Alpharad is just Larry from Pokémon.
I saw grod
Oh yes I saw boulders gate I think
*now play pathfinder*
THE M&L OST 😭😭😭😭
20 seconds into the video and I am so glad that I'm not the only person that had MANY friends who played DnD, thought I would love it, loves the community and concept, and basically everything about it, but never actually played it until WAY after I actually knew what it was  Real talk: The way Jaiden used psychological/emotional warfare on Mark was one of the most devious DnD tactics I have ever witnessed in my life, straight-up sadistic. Hard to believe it was only her first game.
🥨Pretzel🥨
THE DELTARUNE REFERENCE
I wanna learnnnn
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE VOX MACHINA BEING IN THE TAVERN!$
Make it a series!!!!
loved the vox machina cameo!!!
Paul seems like larry SV
1:16 the reference to critical role gave me chills
Salary Man Barbarian is my next character
The Dragonborn just woke up and chose violence
It was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
Why'd you have to choose Slimecicle!? Only hell awaits those who choose him as a Dungeon Master!
I'm only a minute into the video but the fact you put Vox Machina characters in the tavern made me cheer like an idiot.
If you all think playing dnd is really fun, just you wait until the dm says these magic words: "how do you wanna do this"
IT'S WORMIN' TIME!
1.) Ranboo looks amazing in your art style 2.) I love D&D and will forever remember my first Nat 20. It was the first session of the campaign, the party was meeting, and my character and another one became fast friends. Then one of the edgy rogues (we had 2 at the time) punched him, and my character stabbed in retribution, fully expecting to just get her in the arm or something. Nope! I got a Nat 20 and the party had to split up to investigate and get the edgy rogue medical attention. Good times.
I really hope you're not leading the group because who's idea was to let you lead????? hmmmm...........!
4:15 THE BEAST
I love D&D! Welcome to the family!!   …watch out for the dice goblins…
1:40  YOSHIKAGE KIRA YOSHIKAGE KIRA YOSHIKAGE KIRA YOSHIKAGE KIRA YOSHIKAGE KIRA
i never played dnd but it sounds like so mutch fun
i love how jaiden just does a emotional bit  and then spits a ton of acid at the guy and then theres a clip of everyone laughing about it
Mat pat: alpha red and bryson/haminations has the same color shirt, hair and pants (I think) THERE THE SAME!
Once in my d&d game I killed a spider with bug spray
Let me get this straight, Paul basically threw his son around to get the wand?
I love dnd nice to see ranboo you and Charlie love it to
6:57 😂
I really want more of this is so funny :)
Top 10 lines to hard for anime: “ looks like the manager position just opened up.”
woooooo more more more more :D
1:16 is that a vox machina reference?
In my current D&D campaign, my buddy let me just be heinz doofenshmirtz. I do the voice, and my character can spend a turn to craft an inator, but it self destructs after use. D&D is the greatest game simply because all this is within the rules lmao
I cast magic missiles
Why does Paul remind me of Larry
I have never played to 😅
Omg i wish you were on d20
More D&D content. It's time for you to become a D&D tuber.
This has to be a series omg :D
VOX MACHINA AT THE BEGINNING I SCREAMED loved the reference
The Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga music made me so happy. Love the story. This was golden. 😁
Lololol
love the vox machina reference!!
Amazing vids as always, very funny
I’m still flabbergasted about how Dragon Jaiden literally emotionally scarred this worm man who just want to kill a cat  And Larry was there too
ITS WARS SOOOO COOOL pls More :<
I DM a group in a homebrew type world, and I'm just gonna say two things.  1.) One of our party members is a Myconid Necromancer from the Shadow Wizard Mushroom Gang.  2.) One time, in the 'main village', one of the party members, (a Barbarian Tortle named Gar) decides to go talk to the local fortune teller, Zoltar. Here's how it went:  Gar: (After paying Zoltar) Zoltar, will I ever find true love?  Zoltar: (Nervous) Th-That's a tough one, buddy. You might want to see a therapist for that one.  Gar: (Agitated) Well, is there any way for me to become beautiful?  Zoltar: W-well, there is a jeweler down town who can sell you a ring that can give you makeup. B-but it's pretty cheap. You probably just want to... I don't know... Be yourself...?  Gar: I DON'T CARE!!  (Gar rushes down to the nearby jeweler's)  Gar: GIVE ME THE RING!  Jeweler: I don't know what your talking about.  (After much arguing, Gar eventually gets the ring at an immense discount with the help of his friend, and gets +2 intimidation for how bad makeup looks on a Tortle)
bro the vox machina reference was so good
Jaiden,what the heck?! She gave home depression,and then use that against him
The battles are so cool, also so love that Paul is just blonde Larry
1:40 Objection Alpharad’s characters name is clearly Larry not Paul in reference to Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
I one got a boss not to end us I am a god sometimes I should not be in your party just saying 😅
4:15 come wayward souls...
A need a sequel now 😭
i love this
The ultimate team A dragon A cat Wooly from amanda the adventurer And Larry from pokemon S&V Edit: fuck, now i wanna do a D&D campaign
That was awesommmme! Not many videos hold my concentration so well!
Yooo Vox machina
AHHH GUARDIAN TALES MUSIC  7:55 AHH I LOVE THAT GAME!!!
I love the mario superstar saga reference!!
WHAT.
AGAINNNNNN
Another person who's first character is a dragonborn
PLS DO THIS AGAIN, IT WAS AMAZING 👏
0:40 I was literally just watching a song called Charlie’s inferno so as soon as I heard the name Charlie my mind was immediately flooded with music.
Jaiden I think that acid blast was personal.
I was dying laughing after this!
Don’t pin this comment.Please…
how many 1s did you guys roll?
I love how it turns out Ranboo’s character wasn’t trapped in a time loop at all, he was just a raging paranoiac
The CR Easter egg was perfect ❤
Love the little detail at 12:32, where Zoot is thinking of a way to get the artifact down and above their head is a spinning wheel followed by a candle. Clever play on the "lightbulb!" metaphor. (Metaphor? Phrase? Dunno. Good joke though!)
Sounds about typical for a dnd group lol
how long did the game last?
Bro I actually cried when mark got depressed😅
Alpharad out here looking like Larry of the Elite Four
Please, bring more adventures! I beg u
ADVENTURE TIME HORSE
te
Only a month ago I joined my first dnd campaign. We are only 4 sessions in but it is ridiculously fun. This video couldn't be more on time for me! Amazing as always!
I love the little cameo of vox machina
I started playing dnd with a few friends, and i can confirm this stuff is very fun (ny)
I have a cousin who loves DnD and he made me play it with him. It was fun, The not fun part was when I got brutally beaten up by a blacksmith
Can you play Brawl stars and show us how it went please?
The thing I love about this is you can hear them playing. Like you know Charlie would make a random worm say “it’s wormin’ time”.
If I had a nickle for everytime i have seen a dnd character disguise self as some elses ex i would two nickles which isnt a lot but it is weird that it happened twice
As someone who's a fresh DM I gotta take notes
DND best
I always imagine that if a sword wielding character rolls a 1 and dies this means they swung they sword but it got out of their hands at such an angle that it decapitates them
this is the best dnd story ever
I LOVE THIS. I am so happy that you are getting into DND, I can't wait for more!
I cant believe i didnt see this video sooner! Im so upset this video is adorable and fun!
loved it
PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER THIS WAS AMAZING!!!
Barely a minute in and there's a Vox Machina cameo? That is awesome, you are awesome, thank you for being awesome 👏❤️
dragons and dungeons
Nice Vox Machina reference at the beginning.
As a D and D player, i can say that this was a short but fun campaign. I know that Ranboo was a Bard, but I'm not sure about the others. Jaiden had magic, though. I feel like there were a lot of nat 1s. Playing as a Druid now, and as a warlock in a different campaign.
The Pokemon Ranger evil theme is amazing here!!
I love the fact that I saw Vox Machina in this video is amazing didn’t expect to see em
Oh we need more dnd animations please!!!!!
I love the DND backstory trope where the characters lose their wife and kids
Ooo-ooh, better beware! Ooo-ooh, the _beast_ is out there! 4:15  And the names of the turtle at 4:33
Somehow makes sense that Alpharad made Larry.
its such a happy happy day that jaiden first asks for subscribers
NO WAY you cast depression as a command spell XD literally genius
As soon as the sentimental part ended and you acid breathed the dude point blank, I couldn't breath for a few do to how funny that was. I had a somewhat similar scene where I was a armorour artificer with the thunder gauntlets active, a tabaxi(cat person) was in a trance, so I used the gauntlets as defibrillators and accidentally got a crit which killed the tabaxi, spent a spell slot to heal her since she was at 1 hp
Where did the turtle go!? Also please do this again sometime I loved it. Especially the turtle!
VOX MACHINA REFERENCE RIGHT AT THE START IF THE CAMPAIGN ANIMATION AHHHHHHHHHHH
The amount of delight I had just from the reference to Vox Machina was so grand. Not even sure why it had such an impact, but it made my day xD
what game is this? It feels a lot like Irruptos, or dungeon world
my favourite part was when the worm said “it’s wormin’ time” and wormed all over the place
I don't know how this started, but my new favorite thing is listening to Ytubers first time playing DnD...it's so chaotic!
That was awesome.
Bro it's the adventure time fake horse
THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE AT THE START
Dude this one time i picked up a nokia 3310 and it was cursed with a demon in it... plz help i think its angry at me
I remember one time me and my party were on this giant carriage fighting a bunch of goblins when out of nowhere a tree hit me causing me to fall off and die. I haven't played dnd since.
i love how unhinged DnD party shenanigans can be. the first campaign i ever played, we had a cleric who's god is todd howard, the guy who made the skyrim games, and my emo rogue who would use any opportunity to remind everyone about his dead wife. something would happen and i would just loudly go "THIS REMINDS ME OF MY WIFE' much to the party's dismay. in another campaign, we found a horse made out of bones, and i decided my warlock would lick the horse cause dry bones stick to your tongue. turns out he was covered in rotten, slimy flesh, and my warlock got a mouth full of it. also my friend trying to rizz up every monster and be like 'ahaha don't attack us. you're so sexy ahaha'. meanwhile the monster was just a giant rabid humanoid rat
Yikesssssss, you really hit that mans with the depression delux.....nowni wana do that in a dnd captain
Just has the Vox machina cast in the inn 💀
We demand MORE D&D
i like how alpharad is basically just medieval larry lol
16:52 This is exactly how DND works!
I use depression
This absolute chaos sounds like my group. I'm the only nonchaotic character in a group of five in one campaign. And I'm the dm! Its a one shot but we started late so we didnt get super far yet. And then, in the star wars campaign a friend is running, the first thing one of our group did was immediately try to pickpocket the bar tended, fail, and proceed to get in a fight with said bartender, who mind you, has absolutely no stats or info as we were only supposed to talk to them. And get their tail handed to them. Granted, i later got hit by an attack of opportunity as I've never really played and didnt know that was a thing. Live and learn. In short, I love my group so much. We're all chaotic messes and i am all for it. Watching this made me want to try reaching out to see when everyone is free again.
I really appreciate the Mario and Luigi superstar saga music being used for this. Love that game!
Adorable dragonborn character!
This video made me consider what i would want my charecter to be if i ever played, I would have armour that makes me immune to and incapable of using magic and id be a wizard with an aneurysms
That was incredible. 🤣
That was a wild one off session XD
D&D is... uhh... questionable to say the least. It mainly relies on how the DM is feeling though
Paul is just Pokémon Larry
I didn't know one of the top second gen minecraft players was a big dnd nerd that's awesome at least he has a different hobby besides playing minecraft it's funny how you don't watch a YouTube and come to find out they like dnd
im only about a minute and a half in and im already happy bc of the vox machina references
AHH THE CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE
As a huge dungeons and dragons fan myself I have to say this video was AWESOME
God I love these story based videos! They’re so much fun to watch in a pinch for a quick laugh 😂
What about the time loop??
Thats badass! Thanks for telling us the story of your game!
Remember when you played minecraft with carson? You should put that video back up.
story time:  so, I was a wooden elf, druid and me and my party had to breaking into some place but all I remember from that thing is me turning into a black cat and just hoping around some balconies and the guards even tried to pet me but in cat fashion I just walked off. this other story happened in the same place, so the only way my party could tell it was me when I was an animal was that I had purple eyes. Anyways I was a rat in a dungeon, and I came across some other rats. Then for some reason I smelled like a human and not a rat so one of the rats was like " you smell funny...YOU'RE NIOT A RAT, YOU'RE A HUMAN". I would have died if my other druid friend didn't save me.    Another time is when me and my party can across this pack of dire wolves and only, I had the ability to talk to animals, so I can up to one wolf and started to talk to them. It went somewhat like this, "hello there" " HUH, how are you talking to me?" "Long story but can me and my party rest here for a little, we mean no harm" " alright but keep that lizard-folk away.... he looks weird". I miss my party  Thanks for reading this and have a great morning/evening/night
I love this video
Why do I get Nanami vibes from Paul?
This seems like a slightly modified version of  "Wild Sheep Chase" that went off the rails aka pretty much most DnD sessions.  Nice to know Jaiden is every bit the murderhobo we all believed her to be. Wonder if it was "Mace" or "A mace" lol
The adventure time horse Cow thing ! 10:05
Also yay slimecicle the funny man
I have never played DnD before, but I now want to and have no ideo how 💀👍
Did Ranboo/Thalamu get out of the time loop?
“Would you still let me be your manager, even if i was a…. (worm…)?”
2 days ago. I love your videos
paul is giving "INTJ" ngl
You should have the others voiceact their characters next time xD
YEEEEEAAAAAA FELLOW DRAGONBORN PLAYER
LARRY
Paul is literally larry
The first few minutes of this show why DND is so great
did anyone else see this episode and get really excited cause I literally just about died
Is it just me or does Paul look a bit like Larry from pokemon
This was hilarious! My favorite part had to be when jaiden used acid on marks face after what was thought to be a tender moment lol  If you do decide to do more I would definitely watch
This was a fun way to watch a descriptive game
THE WAY WE ALL SAID “OHHHHHHH”
It’s wormin time
1:15 DID ANYONE ELSE NOTICE VOX MACHINA OR AM I INSANE
I don't know if I'm insane or what but I keep seeing Over The Garden Wall references.
RANBOO!!?? =D
I gotta do this next I find a group to play with
The irony is I’ve been playing dnd also!!
Yea I'm going to need more of these videos xD this was amazing, hilarious, adorable, and just a fun time
We need more!!!!!!
Talk about countryballs.
Did anyone get the vox machina reference
I would have used the wand to turn him into a giraffe
You have no idea how happy rancat makes me
I now see what people see in DND this is literal chaos
Luap is paul backwards and he’s Paul jr omg i get it 😮
This was hilarious😂
WHAT IN THE NAME OF EVERYTHING HOLY DID YOU PUT ON YOUR BROWNIES and can I have some? 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Mans just saw his wife, and she tried to kill him D: ...nice one
This is the dumbest campaign ever and I fucking love it
Gg
Spoiler!         I just realized that since luap was paul jr.  That means that paul hurled his son into the air twice to get the wand.
This was amazing!  Please make more D&D content!
Hell yeah, dragonborn!
jnm
Is no one going crazy seeing the Critical Role Vox Machina characters?
we can relate I have never played Dungeons And Dragons.
Dragonborn was my first race as well :D Dragons are just cool but all Aces would probably agree xD
This is so great, If you ever play again let us know
Part 2 please we need more nonsense!!
Adventure time reference 9:51
Glad you had fun with D&D, although I don't think I would've enjoyed myself in your shoes.  This felt too "lolrandom" for my tastes.
A very detailed explanation of this video:  Epic.
Was Alpha's character created in the image of Larry? The badest, the chadest, the high bar 'Two Piece Suit Larry'?
We all want session 2. Make this a series!
Is that the Pokemon Ranger Shadows of Almia music at 12:28?!
I love how alpharads character is just larry
Casuly throws the turles
Benito flakes
I guess I have to unsubscribe because I don't wanna elop with an ogre
I got turned into a sheep during a dnd campaign. A sheep with a peg leg. And acid vomit
HELP I DID THIS SHORT STORY LIKE A WEEK AGO
I was not expecting the Critical Role cameo, so cool!!
Thank you for sharing your adventure with us, it was a lot of fun!
Jaiden pls play Pokémon Rumble😭😭😭😭
Paul careied this sessions
When picking out the Paul Jr.'s name (4:32) most of the names are the names of the frog in Over the Garden Wall!
Having charlie as the DM was both the worst and best decision ever made.
I WANT MORE OF BOTH PAUL JR
Zu not wanting to deal with tjis anymore he threw a dagger at the face's eye "OW,YOU MOTHERF-
I wonder how many unsubs this video gets
I love the drawing of Vox Machina
Swear I can watch and listen to these animated D&D sessions forever. Acid blast to the face was so expected, but still hilarious. Btw, was it simply accidental that your character animated looked very similar to Susie from Deltarune. I feel like your actions were similar to her nature as well.
This is amazing. Please we need more
can play with you guys some time, I've always wanted to play but never did (if you reach out to me and say yes then i would dye of happiness)
That intro got me ngl. Have a sub 😂
so silly i love it
OH MY GOD FIRST FEW MINUTES IN AND THERES VOX MACHINA HELP😭😭😭😭 I’ve tried getting into DND and it seems rlly fun :3 gotta love fantasy games
As someone else who is new to DND and loves it, this is amazing.
This is why I love DnD. The amount of story telling honestly can go in infinite ways.
12:29 anybody know what song is playing here? It sounds familiar but i can't place it and it's driving me nuts-
man i love dnd
The horse the goblins were cooking looks wack with poo brain.. i dont think they should eat it
RELEASE THE SHEETS!! SHOW US THE CHARACTER BUILDS PLEASEEE
“DEPRESSION!!!!”
That is so cool that you played dungeons and dragons with slimcicle and ranboo !
I played d&d once and I was a stop sign. I’m not even joking.
My dad loves it I even have a Onward Version which I only played once 💀 I played it at a fun gaming lounge which has nintendos and xboxes and I love that place Enjoyable! ❤
what an epic ending xd
Now alpha is being used as clickbait, how the tables have turned
I was literally making a character for my dad match tomorrow while watching this 😂
only one problem. You say chest when it is the belly you hit. I can't watch anymore.
amazing
i love how Ranboo is just a cool cat and jaidens this epic dragon while Alpharad was just a normal dude
Paul giving Nanami vibe and I love it!
As a famous monkey once said "hi mark, I'm Paul"
This is the most entertaining video ever
Only CA of know the ppl at the begining
The sheer insanity, and dumb stuff that happened just had me laughing…why can I see this group getting a mech dragon?
Ive never had people to discover d&d proper with. I just play the computer games (BG3 has me obsessed atm)
That was beautiful and I loved it I would love to see more animated dnd videos with you guys that was the most amazing chaos ever
Can we talk about the draconic script next to the word "depression"? idk that was great
Jaden the dragon c:
This is great lol! as someone who also plays an acid Dragon Born caster with comand i will be making people deppressed 10/10 stratigy
Wow
This is such a sick story I love it! \*0*/
Oh, I’m stealing that clay puzzle.
where did paul get the axe from xd
pretty sure the Paul character had some heavy inspiration from Larry in Pokemon scarlet and violet 😂
15:29 *BETRAYAL*
What was the background music at the end of the video? Cause ngl I vibe with it.
I love dnd
how da hell is that sheep gonna be useful in battle XD
Jaden as a Dragon Born is supper fitting
Ok, i shed aa tear at the end
is there stream of the entire session? would love to watch it!
my name is thomas but im not capable of casting spells to trap you XD
This was an absolute blast of a video! Would love to see more of this!
Aight, but the ranboo-cat thing (catboo? Rancat?) was amazing-
was the turtle name a JOJO REFERENCE???
H-Holy fuck that “Assistant Manager at ‘Ye olde Mart of Wal” bit fucking killed me
So we all gonna just ignore the fact that Jacob chose to be the D&D equivalent to Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet or
You more then errand the subscribe
Bruh I need more of these
This was amazing!!! I would love to see more of that! I would definitely watch a whole series about it! Glad you had fun! I play different TTRPGs and can highly recommend Blades in the Dark. My group currently also play DnD "Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden" and it's super fun to DM! We are no animators but we do Memes from our sessions highlights!
THE CRIT ROLE REFERENCES
DUDE THIS WAS MY FIRST CAMPAIGN, THE WIZARD SHEEP GUY, WE FAILED TO SAVE HIM AND HE STAYED A SHEEP FOREVER ANDKSNKSNSKSNSKA
The funniest dungeons & dragons experience I ever had was a few weeks ago. We were breaking out of a prison and I wanted to see if I could get the layout of the prison from one of the enchanted walls. So I decided to seduce the wall to catch the floor plan of the prison. Because I have a 20 base stat in charisma that means I get a plus-5 on any and all charisma checks. And I rolled a 19 on the d20 for the seduction check. I seduced the wall by rolling a 24 still have absolutely zero regrets
I absolutely love how Jacob decided to just be Larry.
noo iceking horse!!!
I can relate to this.
Awesome
That box machina reference at the start 😂 love it
Given that jaiden is a black dragonborn (predisposed to evil) i fully believe she answered wrong intentinally to curse this random stranger to zebrahood for eternity
Amazing!😂❤
hah some of my favorite youtubers playing dnd, thats pretty damn cool
Anybody know what the music at 10:38 is from?
the vox machina cameo 🤌
I think i heard the shape-shifting part somewhere 🤔
Never played DnD but Jaiden has already played a Horror game because Cellbit told her to and Jaiden was just screaming
@15:20 How dare.
I think I speak for alot of people to ask if you could do more of this? D&D really works well with your animation channel and it gives you an opportunity to draw the most creative scenarios on the way!
With the way you talk about this game and what kinds of friends you have, I think we’d be friends if we met in real life and I wasn’t 14. 😅 But we wouldn’t meet in real life unless you visited Sweden 😂
Holy shit I've ran an adventure just like this before
Yo you gotta make more videos like this. It's actually fire
4:15 Beware the Beast!
Pure ttrpg gold. Loved every second of it
Why is no one talking about how Pauldesign is Larry from Pokémon scarlet/violet with the color of Alphrad hair.
Collab with puffin forest?
I'm a Cleric Dwarf main, I love being the rough and tough Dwarf skilled in combat but also mostly support as I boost my party so that they can... blow the entire cavern up... because one of them thinks it's funny... That's alright I'll just heal them and we can do it all again...until one dies because he thought punching a Thunder Dragon was a good idea
that was such a good video^^
5:22 SIR MEOW MUSIC STRIKES AGAIN
Omfg. This is some amazing party chaos! I'd love more! 😂
Paul is so relatable
This was awesome!
I WANT MORE THIS WAS AMAZING!!!! The point-blank acid spray was funny as heck 😆
1:20 DANGORONPA?- oh wait yeah
first step of becoming a dnd youtuber.
Did anyone else think Luap was the missing son Paul as soon as he was introduced? lol
DEPRESSION (breaks down into an emotional wreck so bad that everyone within  a 100 billion mile radius gets severe depression for aproximataletlily 1 year)
Paul looks like Larry from pokemon  Scarlet/Violet
AH! I RECOGNIZE THE VOX MACHINA IN THE OAK INN!
funny situation, i also got into this situation 2 weeks ago
I love the Vox Machina reference
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the subscription/unsubscription plug
in my country there aren't many people who play d&d so i never found anyone to play with but i always wanted to play it with someone😊😊😊
Ok but why does Alpharad’s character look like Draco Malfoy
All my friends hate D&D and I’m the only one who likes it 😭
I'm glad you're having fun. First gaming experiences are special ones. I'm genuinely happy you enjoyed yourself.  That being said... and I hate to be a stick in the mud, but I'm not a fan of lolrandom DnD sessions. You can have a very silly session, but I think a lot of the fun of the game comes from having clear and consistent consequences. If a tavern can blow up from reading a speak with animal scroll... and the tavern blowing up has no consequences... It just kind of spoils the stakes of the game. If cause and effect breaks down in the game, then it's hard for me to care about what happens.
im gonna add "DON'T LISTEN TO HIM HE'S A ZEBRA" to my list of favorite out-of-context quotes, thanks
the depression command is now going to be a thing
Amazing
I love 3 things right now, this, dnd and sir meows secret ingredient to video editing
Please make this a series! I love videos like this ❤
the bard in my party fucked a fcking dragon because he got a crit
If a bard didn't fuck his was through the campain, then its not real D & D
please keep playing dnd and making these I beg you on behalf of everyone
command spell depression-
I definitely would not enjoy DnD at all. I'm a gamer, I need to actually be having my skills tested or working toward a real goal or my brain is just going to immediately shut down.   My opinion is that DnD is for people that need social interaction a hell of a lot more than I do, and for roleplaying nerds, and that's about it. Fair enough if you're one of those, but definitely not for me.
I love playing D N D. I'm usually the DM for my siblings and me playing, and (honestly) the most bonding we've ever had. What happens in a campaign, stays in the campaign
She has DM potential
LARRY!?
I loved the little cameo of Grog, Pike, Vex and Keyleth at the beginning in the bar from Vox Machina!
I miss playing dnd so much but I lost touch with my dnd buddies
I feel bad about gobblegob, he just had bad RNG twice in a row.
I always wanted to play dunjeon and dragon but I dont have any friend or the equiment to do so   Now I want to play it even more
PLESSSE MORE OMG
"Zoot whips out their mace-" But that's a spray can? "in an attempt to pepper spray the sheep" *Oh.*
The,"and proceeds to Acid Blast him point blank from the mouth," caught me so of guard I started choking on my chips.💀💀💀💀💀💀
Heh Crown does "crown of maddness".
the vox machina cameo in the beginning <3
I love all the Mario and Luigi superstar Sega music in the backround
its a turtle final answe!
Is Jacob just Larry The barbarian?
9:51 its adventure timee
I hope you make more episodes of this, it was AMAZING!!
2/3 of you are technically furries. You will be at the mercy of the Emperor soon.
So many critical fails. I love it! This need s to be an on going series
I got to say I love alpharad's Paul hes just so sad and uninterested and disappointed in everything and everyone but he also won't let his friends get hurt I respect that
YAY, DND, THIS IS FINALLY. IT IS TIME! Dnd is for cool kids and NO, you're NOT a nerd for playing it. I've played Dnd for over a year and it's crazy how deep you can go with the rules, backstories, plot twists, vengefull old enemies etc. I think that everyone should test it out since it's a very socialised and fun game where all player's need zero experience as long as you have a character sheet and a dice set or two.
I missed these videos! So good to see one of your classic animations
how can i double sub or something i love d&d
The sound effects and ambiance was everything!!! Loved it
Don’t listen to him he’s a zebra
This was wonderful and hilarious, please for the love of everything do more
this reminds me of our DND campaign, which lasted one day, and the most important thing i remember is that i rolled a nat 1 perception check and saw a rock  there were enemies around us but the rock is most important
I to have played DND for the first time, im in a horror themed campaigned
The music is sublime 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤ i cant stop laughing jayden us top story teller
Me a wizard sleeping off a giant hole in my chest from a manticore
Nicely done with your disguise self into Acid Breath (almost like romance was making your dragonborn puke😹😹😹)  On a side note, I was expecting a dagger in his back, not acid breath
15:32 🤣
JEYDEN I MISSED THESE VIDEOS !!!!
Very fun video. I’ve never played D&D either. It looks fun and like you I’m pretty sure I would enjoy it. Maybe I’ll try to get in on a game.
D&d is rng &d&d
Amazing video and DnD game. I wish I had a DnD group, nobody plays DnD where I live 😢
Yessss let’s go dnd for the win
Never thought id see the day
4:19 YOU ADDED THE BEAST FROM OVER THE GARDEN WALL AHHHH
When i joined my first party the human and half dragon both tried to kill each other so my character shot an arrow towards them to make them stop
I feel like Jaiden would love our Pathfinder group. We are CHAOTIC and even play the TTRPG for Avatar the Last Airbender (Avatar Legends)
Loved it 😂 would like more of it. Good one shot
I loved this so much I hope you do more if you play again.❤
Did any other critters notice Vex Pike Kiki and Grog in the opening😂
Dungeons of depression, no dragons
cool
I find it really funny that charlie said that this was the most psychotic group of characters he's ever had to DM when they don't even come CLOSE to some of the stuff he's dealt with on JRWI. Turning the entirety of New York City into rubber ducks, burning down the tree that is the source of all life itself, even in post reboot JRWI mythborne was deranged
I'd love to see Jaiden's character here interact with dingodoodle's group, tbh.
I have not seen it yet but please make more I know it’s gonna be freaking great
Ranboo go cook them a cake   a good one That dosen't kill god at the precence of it And that means i want i baked a cake 3  P.S I love this i just hope next time There will be voice acting and a fourth party member
Jacob just decided to be Larry 😂
hey I'm not the only who made a Dragonborn character good for you 👍
i love all their designs, great work!
Please do more of these they are amazing
i spotted Vox Machina at 1:14 edit: the beast from over the garden wall is at 4:16 edit: at 9:52 the horse from adventure time is there ALSO because of the dragon shadow at 17:11 could mean that there will possibly be a pt.2 maybe who knows
Dew it!!
WOAH!! I’m so glad you had such a wonderful time with your first session! It seems like you had a really good party makeup too - good mix of classes, and lucky that Paul knew goblin!! I hope your second session is just as fun!!
That door is extremely hard to understand. Too many computer tweaks on that voice.
i need the character sheets to these people so bad asdnaksndjadsn
cat ranboo is now my favorite thing
I love when you can tell when they roll a nat 1 like when paul throws the axe and it spins around and hits him
Dude ... WAS THAT A LARRY REFERENCE?!?
Loved the video! Loved the Mario & Luigi music! And LOVE D&D!
IS THAT A LARRY REFERENCE
Love the little Critical roll reference in there! 1:15
Season 2? 👀👀
all i have to say is yes.
OMG THIS IS THE BEST CROSSOVER IN THE WORLD I CANT WAIT UNTIL YOU COLLABE WITH TOMMYINNIT
1:41 LARRY!! TOTALLY LARRY!!
1:16 :OO KEYLETH AND VEX  Edit: yeah no I’m playing this Ah I have no one to play wi-
I’m a dm of my party and one of party members have a head collection of important people one of them being the king of England 😂(Yes I allow her to keep all of the head)
Hey jaiden im putting you in a pvz parody called animators vs celebrities You replace sunflower, and generate add revenue instead of sun James from the odd1sout is peashooter, And im adding the other characters soon. Let me know what you think.😊
The fact that Paul is essentially Gary from Pokemon Violet makes this so much better!
Paul reminds me of Larry from Pokemon Scarlet & Violet 😂
the vox machina reference is truly a sight to behold
More please!
I seduced a door before.  It talked
I did in fact enjoy the Video. So much so it's even worth a comment.
Nice reference with the crown, rest in peace, king
Mark is giving Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet
for anyone wondering it's at 5:22
lol sound like what me and ma lil bro make up at three am when we cant sleep😂
Fucking awesome!!!
So animated D&D stories are my absolute favorites, and your channel is one of my daughter's favorites.   So basically this is the best video ever!
Finally
The Adventure Time Horse oh my God lol
I watched your livestream!! It was so funny
Notes for my next character, to entrap them with depression and suddenly KO them point blank with fireball or acid blast them.
RANBOO WAS BONGO CAT!!!! HASHSHDHDH ALSO THIS WAS SO FUNNY DO MORE PLEASE!
I love dnd, but i have one friend. And she doesn't play. So I watched your live stream
me spotting feucoco in the background[fire starter pokemon. 4 minutes, 14 seconds in]
❤
We definitely need more of their ongoing adventures
Jaiden,did that man with a beard and a business idea came to you in august or not?
IMMA DRAGAON BORN TOO🔥
OMG I LOVED THIS!!! Kitty and dragon were the cutest!!! Definitely make more!!!
does anyone know what the song is at the end?
CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE YEAAH 1:15
DnD has been a love of mine for about a decade and a half, and it's always great to hear more good people getting into it. Here's hoping every adventure is a blast!  P.s. if you ever get the itch to branch out, there are other ttrpgs out there that're also awesome. Warhammer 40k, World of Darkness, Cyberpunk, and of course the infinite chasm of homebrewing.
Jaiden dear… you just became furry bait  May god have mercy of you, because they will not
I have never played DND before but it sounds so awesome and would love to play it someday!
Loved it!!!❤❤❤❤
ranboo forgor to turn back into human
You could literally tell when the low rolls happen during the vid hahaha
Very fun watch but I think imagining this stuff over hours sounds much less fun than a 15 min animated retelling
Seeing members of Vox Machina made me so happy! Really cool to see Jaiden might also be a Critter
It all restarts became of the time loop lmao
Ok but how the heck was "Worm" the answer to that riddle?
this was absolutely hilarious, pleeeasee more dnd stuff
Lol groundhog day at the start
wtf yo te conosco pero donde
We have a dragon warrior, a cat musician… And Larry       (Only who played scarlet and violet knows what I’m talking about XD)
I just started my first dnd campaign with some friends and im an elf enchant wiz, and i kid you not, my first roll for stats was 4, 1s and for the memes i put it into con, but right sfter that i got 16 int, 16 strenght, 13 dex, 12 wis and 9 cha, i have more stenght and dex in my MEME wizzard then both the rouge and paladin in our party and more charisma then our bard what even is going on with my first game.  Becouse of my wizzards masive strenght stat i was given a magic foci that is just brass knuckles that i punch the air with ti cast magic.  I AM A SAND CANNON, PUNCH WIZZARD, HOW DID I GET SOUCH A PERFECT CHARACTER!!!!
I love that this session starts in the same bar as Vox Machina. That must be canon now.
Can we mention the wonderful Vox Machina appearance???
Is Alpha just Larry from SV? 💀🤣
An absolute banger of animation, and story telling. I've never been more enthralled by a D&D campaign ❤
15:29 If you want to replay the acid spit moment
Bruh, not the turn into wife again 💀
again
I knew the point-blank Acid Breath was coming but goddamn that was funny.
pls do another Rond of dungeons and dragons
Paul’s my fav character for sure 😊🤌🏼
Why does Alpharad look 100% done with everything, before the role playing even starts?
Please do more of these.
So let me guess… Dragonborn Sorcerer, Human Fighter, and Tabaxi Bard
I can see the larry influence in Paul's character.
This video was funny and great and Jaiden is so awesome
You know I always wanted to play dnd I had a chance but I couldn’t take it because we’ll responsibilities and I have some dumb ideas  For Example: This Human fighter that looks like a British Knight but the trick is that if a enemy deals enough Damage they could have a Chance to to cut of a limb and it can keep going until you’re just a head with a torso and you could have prosthetics but instead of things like peg legs and such they just stitch weapons to your missing limbs
wow 1 day and 12.1 million views. good jorb
The first time I ever played DnD, a party member was a bird-person. They were investigating something, while me and the other player wanted to do the same but arrived later. When confronted with what they were doing, they said: 'Laying an egg'. Me and the other person rolled the dice to see if we would believe it, and we both did according to the dice. We then apologized (in character) to the bird-person before a door opened and we continued. I still laugh about it to this day.
She is slowly molding her content to vaguely resemble alpharad
*ahem* A c i d  B l a s t
That was vicious I love it and that was hilarious. You won the game because you all had fun. Achievement unlock welcome to D&D.
That was awesome. Canèt wait or the highlights!
we crave more
ah yes the first time dnd expirience. I got Insultid by a tree and blew up inocent Goblins because they didnt like the cake i baked :D
Answer my rizzles 3
ok I need more of this in my life
Paul is just Larry from Pokémon scarlet😂
I loved this please do more D&D stories in the future
Omg I loved this so mucho, I need more
Where do I watch the vod?
I hate how normal this all is for DnD.
This was the most D&D, D&D campaign I’ve ever heard just imagine if it was a full party
“And proceeds to acid blast him point blank from her mouth.” I’m dying! Please do more of these, please!
Top 10 anime betrayals
More these,love it❤
Somehow, eating the clay didn't surprise me much xD
I love how jacob is just larry
One of my favorite dnd moments was like *at the bar* Me: “Hi can I order a water” Bar guy: “sure just lemme check how much it is” *proceeds to check* Bar guy: “One copper piece” Me: *only has gold pieces* “how much is one gold piece?” Bar guy: “10 silver pieces” Me: “And how much is a silver piece?” Bar guy: “10 copper pieces” Me: “…” Me: “So can I buy 100 waters?” Bar guy: “how about I just give it to you for free 😅?”
Wow random and funny, I haven't played it before but I heard about Dungeons and Dragons though
I love this! I need more animated DnD Stories in my life pls
Make more. Make more. MAKE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE. pls
Isn't this just an AI written fantasy novel?
I loved this video!
When the door spoke: Answer me these riddles 3 My brain: and reclaim this spot taken by me
THIS WAS SO AWSOME OMG I LOVE THIS GROUP OF PSYCHOS
1:16 yooo it’s vox machina
The Easter eggs in this video is so fun!!
Did I just see vox machina😅
amazing
The critical role reference is dope
omfg this is incredible! i love everything ab this. i’ve never played D&D before but now i’m deffo thinking i need to
tf is this beginning and backround lore?!
More
This video was funny
Goblegob😂😂😂
I absolutely love that you put some characters from Vox Machina in the tavern. It’s such a cool Easter egg and I squealed in excitement when I saw them!
i love the zelda soundtrack!
I wonder what the dungeon master smoke to come up with a story like this, it must have been someting REALLY strong
I like the fact that most are “anthropomorphic animal” Does raise some questions
Wait, what about the time loop?
Bro i love dnd im also a dragon born its so cool
This was amazing do more
I need to play DnD too
Omg Vox machina cameo 👀👀
This was so fun!
I love this! Great job!
i play a game close to D&D called Pathfinder. it is pretty much the same, just different rules and stats. I love listening to people talk about D&D and pathfinders so much
PLEASE TELL ME IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS JADIEN'S CHARACTER LOOKS LIKE SUSIE FROM DELTARUNE-
0:37 its effective though, made me sub
The subscribe push was the biggest plot twist ever
That one time when we were fighting a big scale battle and got lost in the ruckus and the mage casted a big ass meteor to finish it in one blast. when we rolled for the location of the characters, me and one friend were on the center of where the meteor was going to hit... fun times!
Cat-person drinking milk in the bar. Love it!
THE VOX MACHINA CAMEO :D
In love with Alpharad but Larry
Oh boy, you guys had fun with this one.
Hear me out on Paul
This is exactly DnD
Gotta say I loved the critical role reference at the start. And Jacob as a Larry clone is great😭
this video was amazing, really. the music at the end also got me dancing I hope somebody knows where I can find it lol
Now try Pathfinder 2e
Maybe the real dungeons and dragons were the friends we made along the way
That was so good it was like watching a really good movie 😁😁😁
the most legendary Shonen arc
THEN PROCEEDS TO ACID BLASTS HIM-
make this a series AHHHHHHH!!!!!
You might want official subtitles because the door is hard to understand.
:3
Most sane first D&D game
Le epic
Paul: my family is dead and I have no way to make more money to somehow find happiness  Tholemu: I’ve been stuck in a time loop for 3 years and I’m desperately trying to find a way out Zoot: just zoot.
Love the reference to critical role at the tavern!
D&D is great
that was not as long as I hoped, because most dnd campains last for days
anybody know if anyone has the full version like original session or vod i’d love to watch the whole thing but i can’t find it :/
I love how the group is a silly dragon born that eats clay, a nervous wreck of a cat, and larry.
9:52 the reference to the creepy horse that ice king wears and spies on Finn and Jake in adventure time
Welcome to DND!
Just wanted to make my mark on this video by saying: I have duck dice for D&D
I LOST IT when jacob threw luaP "so long gay bowser" style, but then at the end somehow laughed harder at the point-blank acid blast
ngl i've been lookin for a way to play DnD online (as in over discord or something like that) but its a bit tough, anyone got advice on finding DnD games?
Ah yes, nice use of “We Can’t Lose!” From Mario & Luigi: SuperStar Saga at 6:00
4:09 Camman18's Worst Nightmare
I’ve been waiting for this!! D&D is the best
Whoa, whoa, whoa, was that thing at the end? 🐍
LOL well this was a funny story!
So D&D is a bit if a quagmire due to who owns it, which I wont get into here.  I wanted to offer suggestion for games that people might enjoy who liked this video.  1) Pathfinder 2nd Edition. D&D but with an employee union, and a more expansive character creator.  2) Blades in the dark and the games made after it using the Forged in the Dark system. Way more focused on player agency  and feel over complexity. Main concept is like a heist movie.  3) City of Mist. Urban fantasy where you power comes from mythology and legend; such as Hades, Goldielocks, or the Pheonix.  4) Call of Cathulu. Go insane trying to solve a mystery
I LOVE THE CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE ♡♡♡♡♡
My jaw DROPPED when Zoot acid blasts Mark after such a tender moment 🤣🤣🤣 it never dropped so far before 🤣🤣
I freaking love the generation loss Reference at the beginning of the game
AlphaRad literaly went like  My name is Yoshikage Kira. I’m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness
Making him miss his wife then using disguste self is perfect lmao
still subbed lol (C1: do you know Mark? C2: From Accounting? C1: Who are you again XD)
Hi jaiden animations I love your channel for what you do and for what you did I made a youtube channel from your inspiration thank you for what you do as a youtuber can't wait to hear the next story!
As someone who has never played, have listened to endless comedy dnd podcasts and am currently in the middle of studying how to DM and get my campaign set up. That was fantastic.
is paul just... larry from pokemon scarlet/violet
I hope @DingoDoodles sees this
I can honestly see why some people find D&D entertaining. I did once consider trying it out myself, but... well, I don't think it's really for me, based on my history with roleplaying.  Also, I'm pretty sure Paul is based on Larry from Pokemon Scarlet/Violet.
Ranboo's character fits with him so well
I gotta see if my friend would do this i never tried DND but i really want to now!!!
I LOVE ALL THE SUPERSTAR SAGA MUSIC!  And you use the original versions as well.  Such an amazing game.
I'm so glad you guys played D&D!! Seeing Campaign 1 Critical Roll Characters in your animation was cool.
YALL ITS A BLONDE LARRY!!!
what a story
Jaiden please make more videos like this if you can and want to.  It’s an absolute blast, and I love the creativity
Absolutely funny at certain points but amazing all around. Wish my sessions were this funny
This was without question the most unhinged inhumane group of total psycho characters I have ever DMed for. When are you free for session 2?
Lizard jaiden is so cute      Smash
WHERE DID THE TURTLE GO
Jacob really just became Larry…Nice.
non-binary icons
Love the Vox Machina reference at the beginning
Damn... It's Deltarune, isn't it?
The way you guys play is more like a cartoon. cool video btw
OMG, I played for the first time recently with my discord friends and I LOVED IT!! We all met irl, it was fantastic  My character is a dragonborn rogue, I already luv my girl sm💕
I love the Vox Machina cameo!
THAT WAS THE BEST! I HAVE TEARS FROM LAUGHING! XD
Let me do this DND is a ttrpg where you and your friends chose a class the dungeon master (dm) makes the story the world and the story
This video is worth writing a book based on D and D! 😊
The chaos of D&D *and* Jaiden and Alpharad? Yes, please
Honestly, i would love to see this group with Dingo Doodles
I love how you put legends of vox machina in there
I thought this was an Alpharad video. Quite surprise when I didn't get Jacob's classic intro
where pokemon go nuzlock?
ALPHA IS LARRY!!!😂
this is the best  episode
I remember the module (I think from DM's Guild) that had this premise. I'm really glad they changed so much about it to really make the story their own. I'd say that what Jaiden and the gang did here was *chef's kiss*  And kudos to Charlie for such a good job DMing
1:16 Keyleth, Vex, Pike and Grog. Jaiden is a Critter.
Is that various musicfrom Mario and Luigi, superstar saga at the door that here.
😂😂😂❤❤
I like how in 9:51 the adventure time staring horse looks to be tied up (SPOILER for adventure time. it is actually ice kings costume to spy on Finn and Jake)
Bongo cat!!! <3 14:01
Vox Machina at the beginning 😭💕
I LOVED THIS! ALSO CAN SOMEONE HELP ME GET A DND CAMPAIN I WANA PLAY BUT AM BRAND NEW TO THE GAME AND HAVE NO CLUE HOW DND BEOUND WORKS
eyyyy vox machina at 1:15 lets goo
No sheep was harmed in the production of this adventure
I feel like alpharad is larry
@1:16 nice use of Vix Machina characters. Think thats Pike, Grog, Vex, Keyleth
Ever realize that when Paul and Tholomew first do their double team attack Tholomew lands like a cat when they fall of something
Great video! I really like the music at 10:38, does anybody know what its from?
This was amazing, please make more ^^
Couldnt be me playing a dragon born, thats how you know it was her first character 😂
the part where you gave him depresstion just killed me 😂😂
14:08  DePrEsSiOn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AHAHAAHAHHAHAHHAHAAHAAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA JAIDEN WHAT.
Nice nod to vox machina at 1:15
this is literlly perfect
Vox Machina Reference!!!
I love Galarian Larry— I mean Paul-
That was an awesome adventure! More DnD!! 😅
Love love love this!!
Why does Larry have an axe.
Love the Critical Role cameo in the beginning
i love your character Jaiden! and i knew you would do this to Mark when you used Disguise Self XD
paul is babygirl
Now I can’t get notified 😭
Thanks
SO WAIT. Jaiden played a dragonborn... druid? Able to speak with animals and having the colour that allows you to acid blast people. Ranboo played a Tabaxi bard I think- With his primary instrument being the bongos, whilst also carrying around some other ones. And Alpharad played... idk, a rogue? Maybe a barbarian that just refuses to rage? Probably just a human as well, most generic guy hence why he's drawn like- whatshisface- Larry from pokemon? The normal type gym leader? And Slime is our amazing dungeon master :D  Jaiden could also be another spellcaster but with the affinity for animals I just went with druid- BUT THATS A REALLY NICE USE OF ACID SPRAY LMAOO-  Edit: NVM I FOUND THE ACTUAL VOD and I have not paid enough attention but Zoot might've been a warlock instead (which explains the more eldritch and less animal friendly spells? And yet their patron is Ari of all people XD)
Bor yot i
Loved the vox machina Easter egg
This is just proof that Ranboo is a furry
Good job on your first game of D&D
this is why i love d&d
Ola jaiden 😊
I was really almost crying at one point...i am way too emotional recently
MOAR
Critical roll in the intro! Haha
can you be a chicken in that game?
I 100% didn’t see the Paul/Luap twist, I loved that. How awesome!
Mark thompson might be the stupidest but best twist ever
love the vox machina reference in the beginning
Shame you had to include Alpharad
Very nice
Another great video
I saw grog!!
MAGIC INSTRUMENTS!!!! I had that idea for a character a long time ago
More dnd please
I'm gay
I need to know what happens next Jaiden please
So AWESOME!! XD
I love the horse thing from adventure time, being cooked     10:12
I love D&D, I just wish I was able to do things like play games with you and charlie, but you gotta be popular for that.
Man, I'm sure this was a ton of work, and it totally shows! I hope we can see more of this group, I'm already in love with these characters 😍
I gotta admit the depression part is really funny
For a first u should sub it was pretty funny
Ah yes, the greatest game. This is your life now.
Why do I feel like Paul is just a reimagining of Larry from Scarlet and Violet?
And she blasted him in the face point-blank with acid blast… -Jaiden 2023
I love how. Alpha is just playing Larry
Omg, your adventure starts off with the wild sheep chase Module. I looked that one up just yesterday since I was thinking about DMing for my group.
The Vox Machina reference made me SO happy.
And proceeds to ACID BLAST HIM
That casual CR cameo at the start in the inn....
well you now no-show it is😅
OOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Critical Role Easter Egg!
sheep : I need your help please save party:just kills the whole tarvent "of course"
Was that the bed dragon at the end?
So youre telling me that this is a party of 2 furries and LARRY? Damn, you gotta sub to this sauce
Meow Meow
PLAY DND WITH ME I SUCK AT IT!!!
4:15 THE BEAST FROM OVER THE GARDEN WALL!  ヾ(≧∇≦*)ヾ
Honestly the full campaign vod would be awesome
This needs to be a whole series this was great
This was super funny 😂
Yo if you make a full unedited version of this session i would love it this sounds like the unbridled chaos of one of mine lol😂😂
9:51 omfg it's SIMON ahahahahaha nice one
I relate to Paul, Luap, and Paul Jr. and it's nice to feel seen.   Also this was a rad first session of D&D lol
Why do I feel like dingo doodles and Jaiden would get along
I miss my wife tails... I miss her a lot..Ill be back
When you're in your D&D phase and suddenly there's D&D content everywhere
jaiden telling people to subscribe feels unnatural
naturally alpharad plays Larry the Adventurer
As someone who loves dnd,  Dnd is fun
Bro D&D is awesome!! Me and my cousin play. He is also currently writing a book about his game
This was pretty cute.  Major kudos to the DM for actually wrapping things up.
1:14 Vox Machina let's GOOOO!!
Honestly when Mark went im for a hug I thought that you would pierce him with your arm. But this works too ig.
i love the Ranboo's character is funny
😭😭😭😭😭😭I NOW BEAR THE KNOWLEDGE OF SHARING A NAME WITH MARKS EX WIFE
1:14 oh hey there, Vox Machina! Seeing familiar faces at this new establishment was unexpected! Grog and Pike having a drinking contest was less unexpected lol  glad you had fun playing DnD, Jaiden!!
I am ganna pee my pants I love slimecucle so much
man yoou realy deda number also at the ponit here  15:23-15:32, i did the same thing in to a undead creater as a mage trough a wall on a nat 20 roll, killling the undead in one blow xD
Me and my friends play D&D club Jaden. Hope you have fun
The Kirby soundtrack used is just *chefs kiss*
What an emotional rollercoaster
Roll for intelligence  2 minus 3 -1  You try to make a word from the scrabble squares and even though the spell ostioperosis and you break the table with your great axe
4:15 BEWAREEEEE THE BEASSTTTT
I would so love to see this as an actual session.
I’m youg and have played it twice
Love d&d. Glad you got to play. Can’t wait to see more animated adventures
I FUCKING LOVE PAUL, the idea of an office worker fighter is so god dam hilarious to me
No matter the video, there’s just something so great about Jaiden’s storytelling skills!!
I played this same one shot as start of my campaign 😭😭😭😭💕💕💕
I will now be naming a future pet turtle. Bong Water.
I did not see that comeing with paul
That's so ironic cuz I'm playing DnD for the first time this week
Yes vox machina
as a part of the D&D community i  welcome u jaiden
Vox Machina easter egg goes hard
I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS VID
Very entertaining. Thanks
Jaden really said "EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!"
Respect for the amount of time and effort it took to make this :)
i had an idea for a campaign in 2018 where there was a pandemic on a continent in this world and there was a severe shortage of certain ingredients needed to make the antidote, which the party had been tasked with recovering. nothing came of it and fastforward a year later covid happened XD
ever thought of making reaction videos?
Laughed SO HARD at the soundtrack perfectly matching the tone. Love LoZ. Great work 🎉
You and your D&D group are absolutely insane and downright chaotic at best. I can only imagine what you would do if you were in a different campaign, wrecking havoc and all manners of chaos...  I would love to host a game for your group.
that was short, but i love it
Vox Machina at the start has me peeing my pants laughing 💀💀💀
best video i ever saw
14:58 I was fully expecting a suplex here, absolutely loved this video.
I loved everything about this. I need MORE.
enjoy it? nah, I LOVED IT!! PLEASE DO MOREEEE WE NEED MOOOOREEEE
17:06 wow the end was very cinematic and cool and funeh and good and stuff 10/10 :D
For anyone who wants to know; this is a fan-made one shot called A Wild Sheep Chase. Very fun, great for new DMs and new players.
9:51 anyone else recognise the horse from that one adventure time episode?
Can I make your dragon into a puppet
It was really cool, but why the 8 months delay?
i woulda thought ranboo as a cleric person but him as a bard works so well
Hey! Vox Machina reference at the Old Oak Inn! Nice!
wow this vid was so cool
oh my god i will not survive without the actual footage uploaded on ur second channel /j BUT PLEASEEE /nf
"Jayden dragon isn't real, she can't be made hentai of"  Meanwhile Jayden dragon:
A fellow Dragonborn main this should be fun
I LOVE D&D
I forgot ranboo existed tbh 😶
I love this
The acid blast part was hilarious
Dude I loved every bit of this you guys made the best characters and did the most feral shit, a perfect dnd session lmao 😂
7:28 got me good
I love how much Tholamew is in the wrong in his conflict wiith Thompson. Thompson says "You kept telling people I cursed you and now no one will talk to me" Tholamew says "This is for the restraining order" in the final standoff
Hi
The door going for double or nothing really cracked me up.
I played d&d for 3 weeks
Jacob is just larry from pokemon violet
1:00 God that music takes me back. Wind Waker was awesome and the home island felt so....well, homely.
Seems not even Youtubers are immune to the terrible meet in a tavern troupe
I'm proud of you for that Acid Breath move.
this is giving adventure time vibes
I never thought this would be the video where I would hear Jaiden say innit
I love Paul
Hey jaiden more NUZLOCKE pokemon black Nuzlocke
The Mario & Luigi Music was amazing for this!!
That was amazing!!!! Please play more and tell us about it ❤
Oh mygosh  jaiden loaded New video FİNLARY
This perfectly encapsulates the spirit of D&D. A group who have no common interests are just roped into a story together, the DM taking them through a crazy adventure and the player chaotically destroying everything along the way until they succeed. Loved it.
Most normal dnd session
Slimecicle and Jaiden is the crossover we needed
Just finished the vox machina show, so happy to see them lmfao, also the worm disintegrating meme reference was pure gold
So fuuun! Now I wanna play.. No fair!
dnd is great and i would LOVE to join !
zoot is just inumaki from jjk
This'll be another classic. like the ruby nuzlocke
Paul junior Roinuj Luap 8:20 " itz wormin tjime "❤ 9:12 disintegration  10:10 14:08 14:48 15:28 😂 PLOT TWIST
references I spotted  1:15  >The Legend of Vox Machina cast: -Keyleth -Vex'ahliah -Grog Strongjaw -Pike Trickfoot  4:14 Ari & Fueco –  4:16 Over the Garden Wall The Beast
I just joined our school DnD club. Thanks Jaiden for the amazing vid!
omg i spotted vox machina
D&D is fun, isn't it? Sadly, everyone I know hates D&D.
Welcome to the fun 😊
Paul just suffering in the whole vid 😅
This is why you’re such a great animator. You take stories from imagination and make them real in your art. I loved the clip of another player and the DM absolutely losing at one particular moment.
Lol
Sounded like y'all had a lot of fun, hope you upload the video of the session soon.
Props to the DM for spontaneously making the crown shaped clay a crown of madness.
"YOU ARE MY PERSONAL HELL !" lost it. The animation is absolutely gorgeous in this one.
People who farted just because 👇
Never really got into D&D myself, but this was legitimately hilarious and I could only imagine the real world discussions about the intended actions before RNG kicked everyone in the teeth on the dice rolls
In my dnd game my pet goose almost ended the entire world. His name is Oli and he was my characters best friend.
The adventure time horse being roasted😂😂
Glad im not the only one who loves dragonborns
I love the nod to Vox Machina in the beginning
Jaiden living my dreams- i wanna play dnd 😭
jaiden finally has her first fursona (or a dragonsona idk)
oH I was not expecting the casual CR reference
awesome!
Jaiden plz play more DND also I reamend watching dingo doodles Shes very funny.
Is it just me or is the bottom right rune on the talking door from Destiny 2?
Paul being designed to resemble Larry is my favourite part 🥹
this was great,but what happened to Zute's bird-demon companion? and the whole evil plot? like, it was such a huge part of the campaign, but it was not included here at all!! why?
Making animations out of DnD campaigns is so refreshing
1:57: wait, is this just Larry from scarlet and violet?.... 10/10
i love that alpha was just larry like that fits so well😭😭
The kiss of death with Jaiden animations art style would be epic probably would never happen but I would love to see that, also the ending was amazing🎉
lol
twas fun to see the little nod to Critical Role (: It's great to see you finding D&D and really enjoying it!!
One of my greatest accomplishments was flirting with a woman to get out of jail, rolling a nat 1, having her get so off nded she brokedown crying and was getting consoled by her partner, and then the person locked in with me preceding to nat 20 in lockpicking so we could sneak out. Pure amazing chaos.
i Love such Funny Chaos DnD
Fun
That, was fantastic
Masterpiece 🥺
Alpharad being basically Larry from Pokemn Scarlet and Violet is honestly the best thing about this campaign.   I don't know why, but I just laughed evertime I see his character.😂
Justice for Paul Jr (The turtle)
As a D&D player, this was 100% accurate to how a campaign can go. While yes, Mark getting acid-blasted in the face was the funniest part, the best part about it was how you included Slimecicle and Ranboo's reactions to it with Jacob's shocked face, because sometimes the reaction is the funniest part of what happens.
Never heard it was actually a online thing.  Thought it was just a board game old people like. Guess I'm too young 🌱 to understand it 😂
Really hope you make more of these :)
The very smooth, calming LoZ music was a great choice for this session of absolute chaos
I just like how Mark doesn’t even have a grudge with Paul, Paul just has a terrible life in general.
Once again Jaiden blows me away with her amazing story telling abilities and incredible animation.
MAKING HIM MISS HIS WIFE THEN USING DISGUISE SELF IS PERFECT LMAO
not ranboo
There was this one time The group came out of a cave after a very long campaign The barbarian, a goliath with max strength was very pissed because daylight was so bright it was hurting his eyes an edgy wizard who also hated the bright daylight buffed him with all his spell slots available and rolled a nat 20 to punch the sun and turned day into night until tomorrow Then it became a trade mark for this player to try and punch the sun in every campaign  It would turn into his objective to punch the sun
This honestly is an amazing animation. God the confrontation at the end completely sent me 🤣🤣
You should do this every time you play D&D in the future! This was awesome!
I also chose a dragonborne for my first DnD campaign!
I love the vox machina nod in the very beginning
Please make more DnD stuff!
I remember watching the stream of this and feeling b ad for alphad suffering in the game. It was so funny.
I thought that was mega charizard at the end
AGAIN
...and then it said "It's worm'n time," then wormed all over the screen🤣🤣🤣
Honestly whole concept of this game sounds incredibly cringe and repulsive. I really don't get how making up stories on the fly and then sharing them with others can be any fun. I'm twisting inside even thinking about adults getting excited about this sort of stuff and even worse later telling others how the game went.   It is literally how 3 year olds play with their imagination. And for adults to do this and get excited is like wearing diapers and willingly shitting yourself. Seriously.
This was perfect
No freaking way this came out after my first time playing as well
Ohhh, "wild sheep Chase"
If I had to guess the classes of the characters.  Zute seems to be a Dragonborn sorcerer.  Paul is either a fighter or a depressed barbarian.  Tholomugh is a tabaxi bard.
I can just imagine Charlie Alfred jaded and ranbo just screaming at each other
Aww man, I don't wanna unsubscribe for not finding DnD fun 😔  Edit: Oh dang, Alpharad's just Larry
This is epic!! The movement! The animation! The fact that I can tell *exactly* how those interactions went with the GM
Lol the crit reference
"starts a casual conversation" *Stares intensely*
Remember: cool guys don't look at explosions.
What I find amazing is that Paul’s avatar looks like a blonde hair version of Larry from Pokémon S&V
Awesome !
I see your Critical Role references 👀
Please please please pleeeeese make moreeeee this is sooooo goOD! DND is such a fun game and I feel like it brings out a silly and creative side in us! (Great for creative drawing peeps)
That was fun
WHY THE 🐑 DID YOU TRY AND SPRAY ME WITH MACE GOT ME DYING 😂
NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE VOX MACHINEA REFERENCE
That was sooo good
I can tell this was a big project, but animation is perfectly suited for this game and abridged stories. And I always enjoy hearing the music of _Outset Island_ or _Dragon Roost Island_. Thank you Jaiden & friends, I Loved it!
Stupidest and funniest memory about my D&D adventure is when my fishman character was for to long out of the water and  my entire party had to pee on him to keep him alive😂
D&D is the BEST! And the critical rol and zelda music appereance made my day 💕
🎉
Table Top Games are so mysterious. They just have this magical ability to instantly delete people's rational minds and grasp on morality once they start playing!  Example: "I grab and throw the baby!" - My own Mother, a school teacher, during our second ever session at the first sign of conflict.
This is absolutely awesome <3
Just finished my second ever DND session.  We made a necklace out of severed goblin ears
8:58 headcrown
we need a part 2
I LOVE D&D
That was absolutely hilarious. Loved every second of it. 100% DND gold.
this is the first time Jaiden collabed with ranboo and charlie slimesicle
I’m so glad she’s finally talking about dnd!  The thing I love about dnd is that if you tell someone a story from a session, if they play as well, they’ll almost always have a just as ridiculous tale to tell you!! And it can become a contest of who’s friends are worse.   That being said.   One time I DMd for a party consisting of a dwarf cleric, a human warlock, a human ranger and a Kalishtar paladin. The VERY FIRST session began with a horde of goblins surrounding the level 1 party in the tavern they were in. (I got tired of them trying to give them plot hooks) some rounds of combat later and the party did great rallying the villagers in the tavern in defense and held them back by making Molotovs (smart move)   however for some reason I still cannot fathom today when they came out onto the roof to throw the molotovs at the goblins trying to break in, the Kalishtar Paladin chucked a Molotov down the ladder they and another came up on. Now this wouldn’t have been a issue normally, a few people could die but it’s just burning some innocent civilians and maybe killing the cleric so it’s chill. However I remembered I had specified before that the ladder they climbed up to reach the roof was in the same room the village kept all their alcohol… so 99 percent of the villagers, the whole party and over 150 goblins all died in one turn.   They had backup characters. This was an average session for us.
Is there no one who's gonna point out that Vox Machina reference at the beginning?
I thought I subscribed but I didn't so thanks for the reminder!  Awesome d&d group, I hope we'll see more from them xD
Turtle Paul Jr will not forget this betrayal
God now I wanna play dnd and make a dwarf character who is dummy thicc and uses his butt cheeks you slap people around.
How casually and great you sneaked the critical role characters into the tavern took me completely off guard 😂
Zuut looks like Suzie from Delta Rune
this has made me want to play d and d
I love your videos keep up the good work 👍
I'm currently in my first dnd we are all starters, except the dm so we constantly learn together and it brought our group closer, all in all good time
vox machina reference in the beginning?
Paul is THE BEST character
Jaiden! Welcome to the furry fandom, glad to have you here. ;3
Cool adventure time references
LETS GOOOOOOOOO THIS CHANNEL IS BECOMING A DND STORY TIME CHANNEL YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Genuinely surprised Jaiden didn't choose an aarakocra
This was a fever dream. Lol
Jaiden subtly placed in Vox Machina and thought we wouldn't notice :))
so jaden is a charisma caster?
Ranboo's character is so cute this is hilarious lol
1:44  did anyone else see the reference to larry from pokemon scarlet and violet
blud is actually just larry
4:15 Owlk? ::)
thank you with this a lot of people are going to give a chanse to play D&D or any other system becouse i such a good time with frinds and with strangers to :D
10/10 video If there were more I'd watch it for ever
1:15 Pike, Keyleth, Vex'ahlia, and Grog cameo 😆
9th level spellcasting to just turn u into a sheep. impressive spitefulness
Heck yeah I love rpg games.
tabazi and dragonbourn how fitting
i am in LOVE with this!!!! I don't know why but i get the feeling the animation team had really fun animating this and creating this! Ah! So much love for you guys for this awesome video!! I also love how Jaiden is growing and branching out and trying new things here and there with her content from Youtube to Twitch and all the in betweens! Don't forget to check up on yourself and take some breather here and there and chill for a bit queen! Again, love love LOVE THE VIDEO JAIDEN!!!
Vox Machina cameo!  Awesome lol 1:16
This some awesome timing, I played for the first time today. So it's fun to see your first experience so soon after my own
I’ve played dnd once, which was funnnn! I wish I can play it again. I was a magic dood with a crossbow… my experience was soooo much normalll. I only beat one dood but helped murder a ton of other enemies. I was smart enough to make sure the doors weren’t rigged.
That's awesome story!
I LOVE this video bc I was planning on playing DND and now I'm more hyped. thank you Jaiden
Is it bad that my brain immediately went to Marc Thompson the voice actor? I got yugioh brainrot
love the pokemon in the background!
Meh. Not a fan of this one
i love how there was both a "critical role" and a "the adventure zone" reference a little less than 3 minutes into the video 💙
1:15 VOX MACHINA?
10/10 would watch this chaos lol
D&D Is Hilariously Fun, Me And My Friends Have Had Some Funny As Heck Adventures. This Video Is Just An Accurate Representation Of One Of A Normal D&D Adventure. At Least To Me. One Of The Funniest Things That’s Happened To My Character Is That He Was Cursed With A “Chocolate Touch” Which Basically Makes Anything He Touches Into Chocolate. It Was Ridiculous And Hilarious.
The point blank part made me laugh so much! XD 😂
one of them is just bongo cat
i saw that over the garden wall reference, jaden
The heartfelt moment then just... ACID BLAST!!!
"ye old Mart of wal" I just
This was amazing
@criticalrole alright get jaiden on a session she put vox machina in here lol
I remember this one time while playing DND with my dad as DM my brother as a ranger me as a sorcerer and my sister as a rogue. most  of  our party had cleared the hostile enemies but the rest were around my sister who kept fumbling her stealth checks and was being mad into a pincushion by 3-4 goblins (we were level 2). So I with my amazing genius use fire hands which causes a 15 foot cone of fire to blast from my hands use it on my sister because she is a tiefling and so resistant to fire right before  I roll I said "so long as I don't roll a nat 20 it should be fine". It was at that moment I remembered I had horrid luck and rolled a nat 20  nearly murdering my sister in an inferno rivaling that of a volcanic eruption.
LOOOOVE how Alpharad’s character kinda looks like Larry from pokemon scarlet and violet 😂
Idk why but the music when those random goblins show up makes me get Peglin flashbacks
1:15 Less than 2 minutes in and I spot Vox Machina! Thanks for the easter eggs Jaiden!
If anyone wants to get into D&D, JoCat’s Crap Guide To D&D series is a good elevator pitch for the classes, just be warned that he swears a lot
8:58 I’m confused about the use of collective pronouns here; I see one person with one crown
*jaiden turns into his ex wife thing whatever thing* I m here darling hugs him *PROCEDS TO ACIDIFY HIS HEAD*
This is so chaotically perfect and I loved every second of it, really excited for a video on your 2nd session if you ever decide to have one :D
also. i want to say. dose Jaden draw herself with a jumpsuit but for her legs or is she only wearing a shirt? it is confusing me
God this makes me want to get back into D&D lol
Think this might be my new favorite jaiden video
I think Rambo is becoming a furry, and to be honest we welcome Rambo with open arms.
A cameo from Vox Machina😍🙏🏼💜 A small but beautiful detail!
Nooo ice king
i absolutely love this and enjoyed it so much, hope you get to play more dnd now that you've seen the fun chaos it can bring
Eyyooo, it's my first time here and you're trending! Rightfully so as well, that was awesome story telling 👏
Oh worm?
I’ve always wanted to play DND, but I never have been able to because I go to a small school and all my friends are Christian’s who think the game came from the devil. Loved the vid! Also, was this streamed? I’d love to watch it!
Me and another person in the party I am a part of committed genocide in D&D just because
This is why I love dnd. The unhingedness of each session is absolutely hilarious, and this video is no exception.
I can tell you had so much fun animating this video :D
Haha same I never played DnD but I always thought I would like it
Not sure who the bad guy is. The manager who became a dark wizard or the party that got into a fight with harmless goblins, attacked a depressed man after giving him a sliver of joy and wlho are partially responsible for him becoming evil.
accurate depiction of the typical D&D experience
I NEVER KNEW I WOULD GET TO SEE MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS COLLAB ON THIS TYPE OF THING AHHFHRIHHRHG THIS MADE MY DAY THANK YOUUUUUU
Jaiden, there is a game similar to Pokémon, and it's called Yo Kai Watch.
Ye Olde Mart of Wal
guys what is the song from 3:14 its in the tip of my tongue but i cant remembeeeeeeer
W vox machina reference
Oh my god this video was absolutely incredible! If you ever made this into a kind of series (similar to Fool’s Gold) I literally think it would be so popular
ya I really liked it!
d&d da best
Yup, I loved that!
Jaiden fr hit Mark with "I'MMA FIRIN MAH LAZER - BLAAAGH"
I’ve only done one DND game and it was seven short 30 minute sessions. It was a very quick game, mostly for beginners, and I had a lot of fun. This experience that I had is basically the same as Jaiden’s and I can definitely say it’s the best role play game ever. So when’s Jaiden planning to make a Geometry Dash 2.2 video? (Obviously 2.2 has to come out first so)
Its like wildsheep chase but more chaotic
The Vox Machina reference❤❤❤❤
Why does that dead horse look familiar?.
Jaiden stop trying new things it’s bad for you
back stabber / blaster
The acid blast was probably one of the funniest things I’ve EVER seen live on stream it was so crazy 😭☠️☠️
wow, loved this video
one of the most perfect examples of a dnd group ever.
Dude I freaking love this! I’ve always wanted to play DnD but I have no idea how to start or join a group 😭 sounds like an absolute blast!
Omg i don't understand nothing but i love it
MORE!! Please beast vid ever please do another episode and make sessions like one season is different dungeon you face and each episode is a different adventure and you can live stream it raw and un edited and then edit it later and post it as and episode to the series pleas do this it would be awesome like if you agree
GOBBLEGOB NOOO
When I saw the thumbnail I Immediately recognized the guy in the back was slimecicle and my first thought was "Jadin what have you done" 😂😂😂
lmao luap that was so obvious
i liked the vid
This was really cool
I played DND didn't have the time to commit to it
this was so chaotic. i love it
One day please have more dnd stuff I love dnd
I greatly appreciate the (assuming I'm right) Mario and Luigi fight music for the team attack.
please tell me this was recorded without animation
"It's wormin' time."
15:29  Jaiden becomes the warlock that whispers a fireball spell in the enemies' ear.
we gotta get an ordem paranormal sesh now too omg
Felt really bad for Mark, but god that vomit betrayal was hilarious lol
if i were the dm i would have made everyone do a dice rol to see if they survived the bomb shockwave behind them just for funsies
I WANT TO PLAY sighhhh
A jelly copter
You should make a series of you and other people playing D&D
THIE IS SO SILLYTYTYY
We need more DnD videos 🤩
Wow) what wobbles in the sky
I love how the manager had a whole sob story being all sad, making people feel bad  And there’s Jaiden.
and shouts: DEPRESSION 🤣
Please turn this into a series
Thats Larry!
PLEASE MORE PLEASE
Is there anyone in this comment sections who plays D&D? Because I’ve always wanted to play as well and Jaiden just proved to me as well as many other shows that it’s so much fun ❤😂
I need like 5000000 more of these
I crave for more
i love how you added the critical role characters and it made me giggle when i saw them
The whole segment with the door has me cackling xD
This Is how we do things in wall of mart 9:22
You think you can cameo Vox Machena and I wouldn't notice?!...   ...  I'm glad you like them too :D
I love your video jaiden , they are very fun to watch for me
Knowing dnd, this was most likely a 7 hour session lol
What class were you??
Jaiden has become so confident in herself, her story telling, and her humor in the past few years. She has very much grown alongside her animation. Jaiden has Come a long way since her face reveal video, and I think that she is one of the best animators on Youtube. Just wanted to point that out and try to outshine some of the negativity in Youtube comments.
I need more of these type of videos!!
Ok I need more
Wow this was mega unhinged. I loved this 😂
Isn’t that…. ✨broom stash man✨
As a former player of dnd sports are better
So there was a tease for part 2 with that dragon because there is a campaing called the dragon queen or somthing like that
I love this video a ton! We need another like this❤
I really want to see more of this. If you guys Do a different campaign you should make it a longer one and maybe spit it into parts. Hey maybe you could even do the fools gold campaign. I’m sure a lot of DND fans would love to see that
loveee this
I always knew she was a dragon Ace
Again love the mario&luigi superstarsaga music 😂
I see some certain familiar members Vox Machina at 1:15 :>
this was so hilarious to watch! please let us know about your next D&D adventure!
Bro my friend RIZZED UP GOD! I in DND
I Love how Ranboo is in this vid; btw love you Ranboo!!!! 10/10 video Jaiden! Love all of you! fav. part is at 12:38! (´▽`ʃ♡ƪ)
This was awesome. 😅
Seeing Ranboo in a Jaiden video has me happy stimming so bad rn
THIS VIDEO WAS SO GOOD OMG JAIDEN the acid blast to the face! ridiculously funny all the twists and turns!
One word to describe this U N H I N G E D
why did i lowkey expect one of you to make a kid out of the clay-
more
Me stealing ideas for my one piece campaign
More more more more more I love these I need MORE NOW
1:15 nice reference!
That was so fun, I’d love more dnd stories if you’re interested in continuing this
Love how you can just know which parts Charlie wrote
I enjoy the CR reference in the tavern
Acid breath, POINT BLANK!
that was an insane one shot haha
rito village theme in the background is fire
dude yall should voice act these things omg
How dare you not invite us!
10/10 best DND story I’ve heard in years and my ex and our friends played so much DND back in college. Jaiden you always have the best content this was amazing 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Jaiden, I love the way you think.  I've done something similar my party dubbed the kiss of death.  White Dragonborn Barbarian.  Win a Grapple, place mouth over enemy's mouth.  EXHALE Cold Breath into the target's body.
"I blow a breath of acid in his face!"
My favourite pat was when he said "its worming time" and then proceeded to worm all over those guys
I literally don’t get how DnD works but this was hilarious
I would love to see more D&D animations, this was great.
1:14 I like the VM reference
ITS WORMIN TIME
does nobody else remember the acid blast from a previous video? i can't remember which one it is for the life of me BUT IT SOUNDS SO FAMILIAR-
It makes so much sense that this is already on trending. I absolutely love this.
Can't wait for Jaiden to show up on critical role or dimension 20
The depression spell and the acid point blank to the face is what made me laugh the hardest.
This makes me want to play D&D XDDD this was epic!
I love this so much! 😊
As someone whose playing their first campaign, DnD is so much fun, I absolutely love it
The biggest surprise in this video is that Jaiden didn't choose to play an Aarakocra
15:27 THE ACID 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If you like dnd, you should try “call of cuthulhu”, you can be completely unhinged and insane  Dnd is completely unhinged, one session I played, I threw the handle of a broken sword at this cursed zombie to stop it from killing an important npc, I almost died from it but everyone leveled up from the battle 🤣🤣🤣, I have almost been fire balled by my teammates and killed
20: it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
MORE OF THESE PLEASE
So…. Ranboo fought the Master Crown and Jacob fought King Dedede,That makes sense
Is...  is no one going to talk about the Vox Machina cameo?
I love d&d welcome to the amazing world of d&d
Dude the "proceeds to acid blast him at point blank" followed by laughter had me deeeeeead 🤣🤣🤣💀
THAT WAS F****** AMAZING OMG PLEASE I NEED MORE!!!!!!!
Jacob basically just Larry with an axe, lol
I love how everything is so chaotic. I am mildly concerned with the fact that there is a satanic pentagon on the inside of sues mouth. You do you. I’m just… concerned. 😕
I love how DnD can be both completely unhinged, absolutely ridiculous, and totally epic all at the same time.
ANOTHER ONE!
Is that the legend of Vox Machina at 1:15?
As a d and d lover; YESSSSSSSSSSSS
Yooo I wanna get into this cause tha was dope
I've never seen a DnD story animated and now i crave more.   Den of the Drake and Crit Crab can't satisfy me anymore/j
Did not expect to get mentioned by name in a jaiden animation video as a main character, but I guess I’m making my big break  - Paul
i made my (very intoxicated) half elf fight a chair, so i can confirm the imagination part
Good ol' Wild Sheep Chase. A great one shot DnD adventure
I lie behind the stars and alter what is real. Close your eyes and I come near. It is not me, but what I may hide, that you really fear. What am I?
Bro Paul is literally Larry!
How is no one talking about vox machina bit at the start
4:16 ITS THE BEAST FROM OVER THE GARDEN WALL 😱
So Dragonborn Jaiden is silly, awkward, and should not have any responsibility whatsoever.  …Yep.  Seems about right.
I don’t like Paul’s attitude
CHARLIE!! Go Jaiden crush them.
Ye old mart of the wal sent me
I actually got the zebra riddle right before the door answered it 😂
Nice video, and the Zelda Wind Waker playing in the background is so nostalgic 🥹
Tha small easter egg of Vox machina at the beginning was cute :)
I've recently started playing DnD, and I've gotta admit, it's definitely growing on me. And seeing your animation is making me like it even more haha!
14:49 click it! there will be 0 regrets
Amazing video as always
thought i was watching failboat when i heard the coconut mall music lol
It’s amazing how I can easily tell which crazy crap resulted from a Nat 1, ie. mace in Paul’s face, or the boomerang axe😂😂
that firebreath shot was perfect XD
I just had my first day of dnd club last week and all we did was create characters but I can't wait for this awesomeness to become our new reality
The beast from over the garden wall made a cameo, so this is now my fav video
Is Alpha’s character just Larry from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet with more backstory?
I like the actual laughter from the party when you acid blast mark tomson after the wholesome moment
"the group, now lost with no direction, decides, for some reason, to all start eating the clay." this is the most D&D sentence I have ever heard
16:30 seriously what is this song from? i cant recall what series its from!!
Ranboo's and Slimecicle's hysterical laughter after Jaiden acid blasted Mark was just amazing
this is exactly what d&d is.
I love that you added in their laughs I cant wait for more fromthe gang
I saw the title and got really exited because you’re one of my favorite YouTubers and dnd is one of my favorite games so this is awesome!
This was hilarious to watch! 😂 Thank you for sharing! If your reading this I hope you have a great day and know. “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV
I LOVE this new type of video! DND is SO fun and I'd love to see more of this type of content in the future! (If you're up for it)
THE BEAST
LARRY?!
I can't wait for another campaign and maybe a longer one. maybe she'll stream it to Twitch or something. But for now, this was an amazing video! I adored the animation and the designs
I would absolutely watch this if it was a show
Paul is just the Larry of this campaign, normal looking but MVP
This was awesome. I'm glad you had a great first d&d experience. On off games are fun, but if you get the right group you can go into full on campaigns which add a lot of depth to the game.
Funny dragon
That was absolutely epic.
It would be awesome if you played a session on live someday, but if not, please just keep turning them into episodes here cause this is amazing lol!!!
Epic! I'd watch more of these! (But still love your gaming videos too!)
MORE
The point-blank acid blast had me DYING
So great! Thanks for the entertainment.
why you gotta do that to mark man
1:16 is that a critical role reference? I see the Druid and I think Grog was the barbarians name…
Just wondering but, is your character supposed to be based off of the dinosaur/person from deltarune? I forgot her name.
OMFG THIS WAS AWESOME
depression!!!!!!!
That Vox Machina easter egg
PLEASE DO MORE SESSIONS! I WANT TO SEE WHERE THIS GOES!
Wait,why does the horse/cow/pig look like the one from adventure time? IS THAT A REFERENCE
4:15 I LOVE THE OVER THE GARDEN WALL REFERENCE
Aaaaahhh this is the unhinged shinanigans i love and miss, i can't wait to get back to D&D whenever i can XD
best vid ever
Amazing content, keep it flowing.
SO GOOD
oh my GOD i want more of these!!! this was so epic!! i’ve always wanted to play D&D and this just gave me all the more motivation to play it 😂
14:21 Mark: I miss my wife Zoot, I miss her a lot
this should be a series
YOOOOO this video was super awesome!
this video was funny and great and Jaiden is awesome!
Any dnd story is always hilarious insane
the legend of zelda windwaker music in the back makes me feel so nostalgic
I loved everyone’s reaction to the acid breath to the face
THE WIND WAKER SOUNDTRACK IM IN LOVE🥹🥹🥹🥹
I love how Jaiden was a dragon, ranboo was a cat, and Alpharad was literally just Larry but with extra lore
14:07 i love this shit so much
hell yea!!
I love your videos jaiden
You should make more DND videos. This was hilarious.
I am also playing dnd for the first time and it is so much fun!
Of course jaiden plays a scaley, color me surprised
What a great video to see right after finishing up with my own dnd session. Also this is gonna be amazing. Most chaotic people I’ve ever watched.
do more of this. now. NOW. N̶̨̛͈͇̤̘͉̠̼̹̗̱̫͐̍̊͆̃Ơ̷̺̍͌̇̒̃̽̿̈́̓͌̓̾̆̌W̶̛̺͈͆̅̍̋̈̀̊͒̐̌͒̽̎̚. ( please :3 )
The psychic was right about a man in a suit will approach jaiden cause Paul is the suit guy
i love the pokemon ranger theme. i see you jaiden. i see you.
Oh shit it’s Larry!
16:08 I CAST THUNDER SPELL
she lost 1mil for subs for the joke
1:14 an animated D&D show Vox Machina characters are shown, nice little detail
I love how you can tell that Charlie made this campaign
I noticed about 5 over the garden wall references from 4:14 - 4:35 alone: - The Beast in the background as one of the creatures - 4, name options, 2 of which I am sure are references and 2 of which could be or could not. 1. Wirt (Most definitely a reference) 2. Jason Fundeberker (Most definitely a reference) 3. Greg (Maybe a reference) 4. Mr. President (Maybe a reference) 3/4 of these were names for Greg's frog, who eventually ended up with the name Jason Fundeberker.
Lmfao, this was awesome. Omg, I really wanna read 1Up on Webtoons now, but I think I have to wait for their hiatus to end, question mark. That friggin acid blast toward the end was both epic af and priceless as hell. Wonderful, wonderful tale.
this was actually a really great video. i loved it! you could play more dnd campaigns and do videos about it
some people don’t understand the genius of mark from walmart because they’ve never seen the twosentancehorror post
like to do part 2 👎
like to do part 2 👎
like to do part 2 👎
YES OMG FINALLY
like to do part 2
I love how Paul and Bartholomew had these deep intricate backstories that got woven into the story and Jaiden was just like DRAGON ACOD FIRE MOUTH SHOT
Amazing video, but how is it nine months late????? /Hj
Can we get more of these please this was amazing!!!!!
please make this a regular thing
I recently had the worst week of my life, and have been wondering if there’s still any joy or reason to be found in living, but this video had me rolling. Took me away from everything for a moment and made me feel the Happiest I’ve been in some time. Thank you Jaiden.
What is the symbol on her tongue? Like is it a rune or glyph? I just want to know for my dnd game.  Great video and animations
This was so fun!😂
I love the little easter egg of seeing Vox Machina in the tavern/inn
You saw Avatar : The Last Airbender
Oh gosh, the Mark Thompson reveal was an unexpected turn 😂😂. That was awesome! Would really like to see more of your D&D sessions animated. Thank you for the video)
i must request more jaiden playing dnd
They got campaign guides too you can check out! Very fun I play with my brothers
That was amazing I stay up on a school night for this….. and it was totally worth it
Love the reference to critical role.
Bot
I cannot believe this is the second DND campaign I've heard of where someone just goes "you are depressed now" with Command and IT WORKS  Also why does it feel like every ace person I know of that's played DND has played a dragonborn at least once? (self inclusive, my first character was a Dragonborn ranger named Jax)
What about the time loop ?
Oh boy! Here I go peelin' again!
Loved this!! Thanks Jaiden!!
I’ve never played either
I'm glad you gave D&D a try. Personally I'm TERRIFIED of giving it a try, since I'd have to worry about the many different types of problematic players, how to play, how to make a character, how to keep that character and everyone else ALIVE... Yeah, everything I listed above basically gets compounded and multiplied so much in my head that I only consume specific D&D content. That and my attention span being the same as a cat.
I love how Paul and Bartholomew had these deep intricate backstories that got woven into the story and Jaiden was just like DRAGON ACOD FIRE MOUTH SHOT
This was so fun to watch, and then I got whiplash because I've run this campaign for my own players! Obviously expanded on in y'all own way, but super cool to see :D
the horse looks familiar...
Again please and thank you
Hi luap
I WANT A SECOND ONE YESTERDAY!!!!
DnD is very fun and I love playing it
THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE ❤😂
My childhood favorite, YouTuber, and my favorite current YouTuber made a video about DnD, the game I’ve been wanting to play for years. I think this is a sign to start playing DND.
I just saw vox machina and i was like "AYEEEE VOX MACHINA"
The ending is unhinged 😂
15:28 is the best moment in this whole thing, no doubt.
Lol one time we kept turning one of our teammates into a frog. We first put them in a bottle, then a cat kennel XD. I also may have used a spell to show a monster snail mating XD-
Beginning be sounding like edge of tomorrow
at 1:16 love the cameo. :P
As a Dragonborn main... I'm very proud of your choice! Wooooo!!!
I do allot of DnD with my friends and stream DnD content when able to. and THIS is exactly why i love DnD. the amazing DM pulling everyones storys together for just a blast of a time. and the players doing crazy fun shit together as a team only to fail wonderfully and still come out on top.  Amazing vidoe as always jaiden. P.S. The acid blast tot he face has me in tears. i cant breath still.
Oh my God I can't believe I got the zebra riddle right even though I barely heard the riddle!!! Also super into this I would love to see more. Also... really want to play dnd but never really found a steady group
enjoyed the critical role reference in the beginning
Jaiden what can i do to kickstart my animating journey
vox machina cameo was something i never thought i needed from jaiden, thank you
such a fun video!! love all the over the garden wall references too, the beast in the woods and names for the turtle were great :)
was a beautiful dumpster fire 10 out of 10
I love Jaiden as a Dragon!
This is gonna bug me, the music that starts at 3:20, i -know- i heard it before. I feel like its from a big video game and as soon as someone tells me i'll smack my head and go "of course!" but can someone remind me of where its from?
Don't know about everyone else, but I'd like to see more d&d inspired videos.
Adored this! I'm a D&D fiend haha
ok I can relate because i just started playing D&D, it is very fun, if you guys want to hear some of my funny stories from my first campaign i would love to share; just reply to the comment if you do. I don't want to bore anyone : )
Gawd I love your music and sound effect choices
That was PEAK
This reminds me of the time my ten year old teifling Druid turned into a lion to kill a man because he scammed so many people from their money, but because she was an outlander she had no concept of law- so the only human of the party had to deal with the town guards while Mitsu (my character) just got a bunch of lemons from the market. (Hope you liked the story lmao)
This is so cool!!!!!
I recently started playing D&D.  So good to see another Dragonborn character romping around this world!
0:48 it’s the goat ranboo!
OMG you guys ran Wild Sheep Chase! I love that adventure
Why you diss god with Shlatt
I NEED MORE OF THIS! ARRRGGGGHHHH!
Yooooo VOX MACHINA
I love how i could imidiatly tell who was who just because i know the creators so well. (:
I love that you put critical role in your animation😂😍. Another great video. Thank you, Jaiden
I love the adventure time creepy horse
THAT WAS SO SILLYYYY YOURE SO LUCKY TO HAVE THAT AS YOUR FIRST CAMPAIGN
is it just me or does alpharads character look a lot like larry from pokemon sv
hi emmie
Alpharad looks like he works a 9-5 😭
“Char EmberBorn mate, fire genasi Druid” (read with Australian accent mixed with an Irish one, mixed with a Russian/German one)
Don't think I didn't spot Vox Machina in the opening pub. I clocked that immediately. Jaiden gets +10 cool points.
My experience with D&D has been writing up half a campaign, group of friends say they wanna play, trying to arrange the date, everyones busy, try and arrange another date, suddenly nobody wants to play anymore.  Would love to have a game like this.
my first session I played in I started a bar fight and threw my 4' teammate at an elf, knocking them both out (the elf we later robbed cause he bought THE ONLY KAZOO but we did manage to steal some rations and a rusty kazoo from them)
the depression command was a stoke of genius XD
I laughed. Hard. Multiple times. Thank you, you're awesome ! :D  Take care.
PAUL IS SANJI  CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE
What about the time loop?
ye olde mart of wall killed me lmfaoo
As a long-time D&D and Jaiden Animations fan, I am really looking forward to watching this video.
I LOVED THE JACOB HORSE REFERENCE AT 9:53 I RLY HOPE THAT WAS INTENTIONAL
The reveal had me gobsmacked my jaw on the floor
Vox Machina 🫡
"ooohhhh mark thompson"  -hawaii movie
Jaiden guest on Just Roll With It when????
With this kind of creativity and storytelling, I think Jaiden would make a top-tier Dungeon Master
CAN WE PLEASE GET A SERIES OUT OF THIS!?!?!?!
i would KILL to have a podcast of this
Are there any platforms that would let a total noob join a party and campaign? Actually, I'd love if a veteran DM would take on a small group of strangers (both in game and irl) and guide them through their first compaign
The Wind Waker theme 😂
The vox machina reference at the beginning is great
OMG THE ADVENTURE TIME REFERENCES
Man I should play more DnD
How am I not suprised you and ranboo went for animal races
D&D is so fun to play especially with friends and love how unpredictable the game is
It is fun I dated a rat once
yassssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
A point blank acid blast to the face of a crying villain. Yep. This is a D&D session.
paul is just like me fr...
Mid content
The Vox machines reference
This was absolutely awesome!
2:43 that is not the most unhinged character intro that I’ve heard, for anyone who hasn’t played dnd and think that sounds out of the ordinary.
Loved the Vox Machina reference in the beginning 🥰  Only crime:  no Percy 😢
MORE
nah that last song slaps so hard
I loved The part where the Worm said „its worming time“ and wormed all other the place
Just would like to say, to people who this is there first time play dnd. Dnd doesn’t have to be completely imagine nation, you can play on a board online or with mini figures. I know from personal experience it is tough to completely imagine it all
ranboos character seemes so cool. If you ever do this again i think it would be cool if everyone could voice their own characters:D
The part when she’s hugging him and then acid sprayed and everyone’s laughing had to be the best part I loved it sooo much and it was so entertaining thank you jaiden😂
I have been waiting for this video for awhile. Most story time animators eventually stop doing that and either quit making videos all togeather or branch out into a differant kind of stories. Most common is dnd but oddonesout seams to be going in the direction of cartoons, or possibly animated comics.  All in all glad to see this beutiful chaos.  Ps. Last.
I knew it! Paul Jr was the sheep!
Omg your so lucky I would be a witch
Fuck yes this was so inspiring for my own campaigns hahaha
Why do I sense that the Paul character is Larry from Pokemon Scarlett and Violet
i love how at 10:15 the horse that their burning is from adventure time
Cool
Nice adventure time reference 9:53
That is the best group of people I think I have ever heard in my life.
Guys my YouTubers are having a cross over event idk what to do
ICE KING NOOOOOOO 9:51
8:22 truly amazing moment when the worm said 'it's wormin' time' and wormed all over the place
You can tell charlie was behind this.
I like to play this game with you guys maybe one day when I graduate and visit Arizona I like to join this dungeons & dragons while your version of it and use my imagination will be fun Taylor to the heartbreak Fox Shawn red he has a dark saber and wills  laser gun and his metal Steve a 1992 Silverado black with zebra printed on and his spandex or the same color from his metal Steve this is a great character but first let me finish my school next year episode my little square to do and give me full license and then I'll go Arizona see you then maybe.
Why goblins eat horse from adventure time?
When an experienced DM meets a total chaotic players lol
This is a great twist on the A Wild Sheep Chase one shot by therainydaze
Zoot just doing Depression!
I absolutely love the idea of just being able to shout 'DEPRESSION' in someone's general direction and completely wreck them from the inside out.
This is your best video by far. You should definitely make more DND videos.
aren't cats lactose intoleranct(i cant spell)
Critical roll!
it is obvious that this session was made for a video, and I belive that it's not the ideal first impression of dnd for a new player like Jaiden. I can only hope that this video inspires viewers to play and expirence the real game by themselves. And I hope Jaiden joins a real game purely for the sake of fun and story telling.
I WANT MORE OF THIS NOWWWW
Paul is so near and dear to me
I just finished my first dnd campaign yesterday as a Dragonborn, so I now understand this
Want more like this this so fun and entertaining!!!
The goblins really said "We are The Gob glob gobgalab" 💀💀
That is such a FUN one shot!
Bro is larry
is paul suppposed to be a blonde larry from scarlet and violet?
I NEED PART 2
this was dope! heres hoping we get to see more of the party's adventures!
yo jaiden just wanna ask if you're gonna make an video about qsmp?
Im happy to see this getting popular
That was amazing
That was awesome 😂❤ I'd love to play D&D as well
Loved this video soo much💕
will you guys continue with the same characters or do more one-shots?
more ari!!!
THE ENDING WAS SUPER FUNNY LMAOOO
Omg I love dnd I have played two campaigns currently starting my third and absolutely love seeing animated versions of everyone’s campaigns. I hope you create more of this I would absolutely watch them a hundred thousand billion times!!!
ye olde mart of wall broke me, i gotta play more d&d man
Ive always new jaiden was a furry
i've tried dnd like three different times  but idk. despite sounding like my kind of thing i just never got into it.
Love the Vox Machina cameo
omg this was awesome, i'd love to watch more dnd jaiden content
this was hillarious. honestly you are my favourite animation channel i have found because your not a storytime animator as much anymore, you animate other things like games, though i still do like storytime animators dont get me wrong. great video jaiden
THE VOX MACHINA CAMEO
DND allows everyone to unleash their most chaotic and unhinged sides
Fing called that breath attack! And Def knew jaiden would be this chaotic
8:03 Imagine if Tholemew made like a calandar or somesuch and Paul had made his son and then they didn't have to fight those creations.
I can't wait for the highlights, and I hope we will see more DND from you, cause this was awesome.
Jaidens acid blasts are W OP lol
That was awesome!!!
Mark was playing a sad song on the world's smallest violin
OMG JAIDEN!!! I LOVE THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE ON 1:10 ❤️❤️❤️
U NEED TO MAKE A PART 2 AND RECORD YALL DOING IT IN PERSON PLS
music fit perfectly
3:28 the censoring with baaing lol
This was very cute and funny.  I hope you do more of these D&D.
Incredible!!
command: depression is so funny
At least no one’s met a dragon yet, especially the bard😅
I LOVE THIS VIDEO I LOVE DND
Keyleth vex'ahlia pike and grog at 1:15 ?!! Jaiden is a critical role fan? Or her animator is?
Jaiden’s character looks like Susie from deltarune
"Depression" made me lagh.
DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS DOING ITS THING SPREADING ITS INFLUENCE TO EVERY CONTENT CREATOR IN EXSISTSANCE
9:51 I’m pretty sure the horse on the spit is based off of the horse form that one episode of adventure time and I love it.
Let's go furrieeeees, let's make fanarts of dragon Jaiden
I recently also got into D&D and I love it! So glad u enjoyed ur first time!
In the next one maybe Alpharad will play Paul Jr
AHHHH I LOVE THIS ♡♡♡
Animzted dnd is so good ,, prepair for emotional destruction in 2 years everybody
I really hope you make more of these watching them is so entertaining
This is BY FAR my favorite video from Jaiden *EVER!!* She combined all of my favorite creators, a beautifully run DND campaign (awesome work Charlie!) AND made a stunning animation for it!! I hope to see more sessions of this campaign! <3
Hey I’m playing for the first time too!
this was an absolute treat to watch, i loved this
I love how every party member comes in strong with their own obvious plot hook and they all get ignored in favor of the one the DM presumably actually planned for.
PAUL JR GAVE ME SO MUCH ANXIETY OMG
God I loved this video
Okay so I wanna say that I absolutely loved this you did such a good job and I kinda wanna watch more of this kinda stuff. I’ve  just gotten into watching dnd content and I think this is my favorite
DEPRESSION!
D&D is fun, but honestly, I prefer Pathfinder.
My only knowledge of dnd comes from this and DougDougs twitch campaign  Needless to say, it seems like a good time
The best part is when the worm went *_"It's worming time"_* and wormed all over the party.
I was so happy when I saw you chose a dragonborn. That's my favorite of the DnD races, if only due to how freaking cool it is to be able to not only look draconic, but have a breath weapon. Personally I usually choose either a white or silver dragonborn so I can have the ice breath weapon, which actually at one point became my party's sole source of water at one point. That was fun :)
I’ve always wanted to play but none of my friends find it interesting and are toxic so I feel like they will judge me for playing it 🥲
9:52 adventure time reference
I need moreeee
Average first session of DND 😂
Loved that Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga pieces all around the place! (starts at around 4:40 :D)
VOD?
the moment i heard charlie i knew
Yo coconut mall
You are suspiciously good at drawing anthropormorphic animals
Poor mark that acid splash
NEVER KNEW I SEE JADEN, CHARLIE SLIMESICKLE, AND RAMBOO TOGETHER PLAYING D&D I WANNA TRY PLAYING D&D NOW!!!!!!!!!!!
them thinking eating the clay is the answer is the most dnd party thing i have ever heard or seen
I can’t help but see Paul as a old Draco malfoy 💀
Loved this video so much!!!
Purely by coincidence i already knew that Luap was Paul jr because in my campaign there's a pair of twins where one is called Paul and the other Luap and so immediately recognized the name flip, love this though would be amazing to see more of it
Oh you poor unfortunate soul. Playing the most BORING game on earth. My heart bleeds for you.
1:15 is a critical role reference. Pike, Grog, Keyleth and Vax of Vox Machina can be seen
So jacob just made a regular ass businessman with a giant axe with a weird obsession for team attacks? I love this man
Shadows of Almia's Cargo Ship at 12:27??? Absolutely based.
My childhood favorite animated storytime YouTuber playing dnd with my favorite Minecraft YouTubers as a teen is absolutely fucking mindblowing
13:04 "Well hey there neighbor, oh and Paul, it's me, Jake from State Farm..."
I love this. And It would be really cool if you made a series based off of your DND campaigns
Its worming time
VOX MAKINA
As someone who has recently gotten really into DND, trying to guess your character classes. Tholamew is obviously a bard. Guessing either Fighter or Barbarian for Paul. And as for Sue, either sorcerer or druid. lmk if I got these right or wrong
DAAAAAAAMN YOUR DM IS SO AWESOME! SLIME BOI SURE IS GREAT AT THIS! and i gotta say,that scene with you acid-blasting mark,and especialy your storytelling are realy awesome too! i think ive seen an animation of this a long time ago tho,but i have no idea.
CRITICAL ROLE EASTER EGGS F&EW*OHIUFJO
VOX MACHINA MENTION YASSS Loved the vid!
This is great. Love all the Zelda music too haha
I wanna know the classes! Obviously, the cat was a tholemu was a bard but there are a couple options for the other two.
Anyone else notice the Vox Machina group in the Inn at the start😂
1:16 I see you critical role references
Who decided to add Critical Role Thank you for that
I remember watching a clip of Jaiden shapeshifting into the dude’s wife, but I didn’t realize the rest of the campaign was like that! xD glad you included Slimecicle and Ranboo’s genuine reactions in it
Good vid
i was infinitely more shocked than the characters to find out mark thompson was one person
I love DnD, and this made me love it even more. And I also love Jaiden's storytelling stuff, it's so fun. I can say it may be my new favourite video :D
Man, Charlie's dice were not cooperating during that goblin battle, huh.
16:30 Reference to Let's Go Pikachu in 30 minutes
10:51 is that the horse from adventure time?😭
I'm going to need about six seasons of this please 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Charlie's DMing style is so distinctive I can just HEAR him doing some of these bits lmao
"its wormin time" 😂 hahahahaha "DEPRESSION!" HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!
O good I thought she died from a car crash
I really wish we could see the voice recording of the game
Did anyone else see the goblins eating the poo-brained horse from adventure time?
THE LUAP PLOT TWIST IS SO WHOLESOME
Over The Garden Wall references??? W??
Funny thing is, this came out the day of my friend's birthday D&D oneshot, three players were theives/assassins (me included) and the other guy was just a blind man (think Daredevil from Marvel). We were going through this magician's lair and we had to find five keys, first room was a room with a large door that had symbols on it and a shiny red button, the second room had an enemy encounter where me and one other player befriended displacer beasts (they look like panthers with six legs and two tentacle tails), the blind guy was mauled by our new friends because he killed another displacer beast and was carrying the head around like a trophy. We gather the rest of the keys and enter the room with the magician, where Theif One tries to charm the magician into giving us the item we were after, that didn't work and they got burnt with a fire spell. After a few rounds of combat, Theif two was able to steal his spellbook and tore out some random pages to cast spells and casted Freeze Time. Long story short Theif Two dealt a total of 66 damage to the magician and I was able to get the finishing blow, chopping his head off and ending the battle and apparently saving us an entire rematch agianst him (he planned to cast wish to wish fo us to return to when we first entered)
COMMAND WORD: DEPRESSION
Jacob definitely rolled a nat 1 when his axe boomeranged back and hit him in the head 😂😂😂
Campaign (clap×3) campaign (clap×3)
Excuse me, I speak Spanish, and I turn off the subtitles¿ok? So... what happend with the turtle?
I just started watching and is Alpharad supposed to be Larry?
Oooh I ran this base story a while ago, its so much fun to DM. Such chaos :D
i love all the over the garden wall bits- the beast in the forest and all the frog names for paul jr (the turtle not the actual one)
I cannot believe we got a jaiden dnd game with THIS CAST OF CHAOS GREMLINS. INSANE. (also I saw Vox machina in that inn there, love the CR ref!!)
A fellow dragonborn I see. 😂😂😂.
this was great, everything about it, fantastic.
Next time you should play with Doug Doug
Seem so fun!
You made me want to play this game
4:15 Over The Garden Wall reference POGGERS
Even though you are voicing all the characters here, i can still hear charlies voice with the NPCs
i hate d&d
honestly one of the funniest animations i have ever watched
1:39 Kira Yoshikage reference
YESSS WELCOME TO THE DND RABBIT HOLE JAIDEN MWAHAHAH
This is so good! Can you make part 2?
beautiful
DnD for the win … it’s important
The dying part after beating the game has always been there and I guess I was the first to have it happen when I tried to play Hours in second and with the oof Tempo and just let myself die at the end
tholomew got that ice king treatment
So, ranboo is a tabaxi bard, alpharad is a human barbarian, and jaiden is a dragonborn sorcerer?
9:50 that looks like that one "horse" with the weird eyes from Adventure Time
Anyone know the music at the end?
i have watched this video 14 times and im not stopping any time soon
This was by far the BEST D&D vid i ever seen. I pray we get more dnd stuff like this
Horse from adventure time?
This was such a good video idea. Your animations  are always fun to watch and DnD stories are the best fuel for them. Please make more.
NEEERDDS! NOTHING BUT NERDS!
when I heard mark's backstory I found something on the ground and it was the worlds smallest violin
can you make a series of dnd vids sort of like fools gold
You forgot the part where Zoot gets dragged to hell for breaking their deal
Love the Vox Machina reference lol
It was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome.
im so happy i watched this highed
IM SO FUCKING MICHEEVIPOUS I NEVER THOGUHT ME AND RANBOO WOUlD SHARE SIMILAR DND CHARACTERS
You should do more of this if willing!!!
PLEASE THIS WAS SO GOOD IM BEGGING FOR MORE
I LOVE Paul
Loved that you had Vox Machina drinking at the inn!!! 😂
Pfft, best edit of sheep chase I've heard. A beautiful story
love the Vox machina references!!
ITS THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME!!
AAA BABYS FIRST CAMPAIGN!!!
VERY much appreciate the mario and luigi ss music
I WANT MORE!
Congratulations on officially becoming a D&D YouTuber
The Paul representation in this video was so validating
This was amazing
AAAAA THIS WAS SO COOL!!!! i wish i had peeps who want to play dnd it sounds so fun
Jayden: "D&D is very popular. Almost everyone I have ever met absolutely loves it" Me: ...what? * Begins thinking furiously* "Have I somehow been living in an alternate dimension all this time? With Youtube as my only window to a parallel world?? One where the things I like are actually mainstream??? How is this even possible??!! * Then I remember, it's USA, not Spain* "Oooooooh, yeah that makes more sense"
I could have watched 3 hours of this.
this makes me want to play dnd again - the last and only time i played, i persuaded a nerd librarian to join my team, but the rest of the party just wanted to kill them, and ended up shooting past them, shooting a hole in our ship, and then killed them and used their cut up limb to plug the hole, and put the rest of their body in the middle of their town square as a warning for everyone 😅
THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE!!!!
that acid blast moment has to be so brutal and sad but so so funny at the same time
I like the fact that The one character in the tavern kindve looked like gorthan from dingo's campaign. 😮
I love that Jason Funderberker was of the options for a turtle name >:]
Lmao. The puzzle is literally spelled out for the party: "Create anything you want out of the clay." Party: "Lets eat the clay!" Classic
Crown of madness? More like clay of…madness…
i like the critical roll easter egg at 1:15
EPIC
I’m lucky to be in a campaigne that went from 1 to 18. We’re close to the final boss at 20. Since its been going on for so long, and there’s so much absurd ridiculous lore, there have been some quite weird and asome sessions. DND is asome
Dream smp members playing board game not minecraft. Rare sight
Seeing the depression command animated brought a tear to my eye
as someone who plays d&d i cant imagine such a short campaign
My DM once was coming up with junk items at a magic store and created an item that was essentially liquefied cotton candy where half a drop would create enough to feed the party for a full day. I bought several bottles of the stuff and I did the math on how much cotton candy I actually had, I did the math and we realized that they could be used like grenades as one bottle held enough cotton candy to explode a house from the pressure. Ended up killing the whole party when we fell down a hole and landed on the bag with the bottles and like 100 tons of cotton candy exploded out from my location in an instant, was fun
YES!!! YES!!! YES!!!... YES!!!
This is great story and you played it very well, despite being new player. I, as a GM, especially love the clay challenge, it's very inspiring.
YOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DND!!! I loved like, MarkThompson reunting with his "wife" and then "her" blasting him with acid. And the goblins!!! Overall, great. I've played it a few times myself, but not a lot.
Paul no just Larry
I was just waiting for the Mark’s wife bit 😅
i appreciate that jacob serves as good representation for those of us who just translate existing characters into dnd, reminds me of my team rocket rogue/ranger build lol
Vox Machina at the start got me so excited but I was already hyped when it said it’s about DnD
crit role reference...nice...
*Meanwhile*  in my D N D session "You have found out the villain has been using your DNA to make an army of clones" Me "Roll for charisma!" Roll20 "20!" The clones "TheRealRehman! Yes! AH HA! Yes! TheRealRehman! AH HA!"
The animation of ranboo at the bar, feel bad for bossssss
Is there a place to send fan mail?
what
This sounds like a really shot story like did you do it in one session?
I love the part where it first shows Slime cause its such a great representation of his character.
cool
HOLY FUCK I LOVE THIS
Wow, I’ve played dnd and this is exactly how it would go.
Vox Machina???!? are u a critter Jaiden?
I absolutely love your videos jaiden, it’s so epic seeing you post more videos again
My problem with watching d&d content is that I'm a visual person. I find it hard to keep track of a story without visuals so seeing it animated is really really helpful and enjoyable. Amazing video!
I loved it when the worm said it’s wormin time.  (This is satire)
I loved the critical role reference! 1:14
Best use of the command spell I’m going to keep that in mind
1:14 OMGGGGGG That vox Machina reference was GOD
Bro Jacob made Larry from Pokemon Scarlet & Violet to play as lmao
0:56 i knew jaiden was a furry
Got damn I wish I had friends to play DND with, this sounds so fun
How did it go well mine always go to hell
I never had such a cool d&d seasion this has inspired me to try harder for my campaigns, thank you so much!
I wanna see more, that was awesome.
3:28 got me rofl like bruh your voice lines and animation is top notch
Critical role references
Least insane “Only at Walmart” story
Awesome video! Can anyone tell me what the final song is called? It is such a bop.
Why are you the fucking ender dragon
Is that THE vox machina at 1:15?
I don’t think I laughed as hard as I did to that final joke in months - thanks Jaiden for sharing some DND energy with us
i need more of this. imidiatly!
nice point blank acid spray there Jaiden, i also love how Alpahrad is speechless during that hole thing and Ranboo and Sliesicle are just dying from laughter   Edit:MOTHER IM FAMOUS
Cool
THIS COULD BE A BOOK THIS IS AMAZING
dude ranboo looks so cute in the thumbnail 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Love this, so awesome. Always wanted to play but newer got the chance. I hope you enjoy making these so there will be more!!
that was an amazing story and perfect animation to go along with it!!
But what happened to the turtle?!
D&D plus animation is truly one of the best things of all time!
This was really good dnd animation story. I honestly prefer this style of dnd animated videos than other a bit more. Also acid breath bleeeeeeeeh
VOX MACHINA ?!?
They put his shlong in the jar
this was a funny vid ❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😊😊😊😊
Hey look it's Dingo! Wait...
I almost thought that Tholomew would wake up ando realized he was still on the loop
MAKING HIM MISS HIS WIFE THEN USING DISGUISE SELF IS PERFECT LMAO
Who knew that depression could be cured with an acid blast to the face?
i think the session was a success
This was such a fun video. Can’t wait for season 2😂
I like how it all made sense in the end. Now i’m defintely hooked and would like to see more
NOT THE FIRST CAMPAIGN I EVER RAN
1:15 where are Vax and Scanlan? You're giving us ideas.
😊
lysm jaiden 💗💗💗💗
Honestly I would love for this to be a recurring thing and having the other guys do their voice parts!
This was super fun to watch! Glad you enjoyed yourself!
Jaiden i love your fursona
Oh my goodness 😂I have a cat named Bartholowmeow 🐈‍⬛
As always this was a great video! I hope we get to see another d&d video. 😊
Can we talk about Alpha’s unnatural attraction to being Larry???
It's cool to see DnD get more and more popular!
did yall record this or anything? if so where can i watch it? this sounds super fun Edit: Just finished watching the video, so yeah ig there will be highlights. Looking forward to it!
Love dnd, hopefully any of you reading the comments are inspired to play too!
My character is a taffling and my role is a cleric and also I put as my name Berserker
Love the easter egg to Vox Machina, what a great show :)
This vid couldn’t come at a more coincidental time. Today is also my first day of playing DND!
*is a dungeon master of 6 years and plays dnd* one of us one of us one of us
OK well great now I have to figure out how to play dnd bc THIS VID WAS AMAZING TY JAYDEN!! ❤️❤️
this was adorable !!!!
Me and Paul share the same name and the same pain
I said i would eat the clay before that even came lol
I would love to see highlights or a whole livestream of the footage of the game tbh it would be super fun! Or idk if you have a patreon or channel members thing but maybe the full cut should be reserved for them. I mean, I've never been a patreon or channel member so that means I wouldn't see it, but just saying what I think would be fair.
Well, I gotta unsub now (It is the LAW)
I’m glad you had fun for your first time playing dnd. Mine involved my dm giving us an old lady betrayal, and he barbecued my ranger’s boar with fireball.
I would love to see another video like this :>
9:52 poo brain horse...
Why are the goblins eating the fake horse the ice king uses in adventure time??
10:00 is that the horse from Adventure Time??
I RECOGNIZE THAT ACID BLAST BIT! Funniest tomfoolery I've ever seen xD
Paul remind me of larry from pokemon violet
9:51 is that horse who i think it is? It better not be from a certain cartoon released on cartoon network in 2010 originally being a short on nick toons that was eventually denied by nickelodeon and picked up by cartoon network and has 2 spinoff shows that are HBO max originals...
I love D&D so much and since now you have too  you are one of my favorite YouTubers!
Woah jaidens a dragon 0:56
…Read more                  I liked my own comment also great vid
Is there a reason you keep saying “their” when referring to a male cat.   Great animation and what not. But crappy like that immediately ruined any fun or immersion.
This is awesome, i saw this live and it looks amazing animated ❤
I never would’ve imagined this group but I’m so glad that some of my favorite content creators came together to do…this
1:16 points for adding Vox Machina in there
Paul gave me serious gym leader Larry vibes and I'm not sure if it was intentional
I love the Vox Machina cameo
"MORE" "GIVE ME MORE!" - Jedi Fallen Order Purge Trooper
Glad to see you chose Dragonborn, the best race, because dragons are cool
PLS FUCKING TIME DIE TO DIE
Paul is such a mood 💀
This is so me coded
That’s one heck of a Wild Sheep Chase
Ice King’s horse costume
I absolutely need more
Poor Paul honestly
Can I just say alpharad looks like draco malfoy????
How many "1" had in this session?  In any case, beautiful.
I see those Vox Machina characters 😁😁
Great animation as always!
The Vox Machina cameo🥰🤟🏾
For people who know Warrior Cats, this is the story for you.       I was a fat, former kitty pet named Lawnpaw who had such low Dexterity that I made it canon that I rolled around and was super fat. Anyways. I could change my nose from a pink one, bottle cap, and a bird beak. I also had a best friend who was a fat Robin who died and I described to my ‘so called best friend’ Stormpaw, the medicine apprentice who had a large scar and didn’t tell me what from, as ‘just super fat’ which made everyone dislike me. I almost died on the Thunderpath and didn’t tell the leader o.o. And then my mentor went missing. And my fellow apprentice, Littlepaw, turned out to have attacked (I think my mentor?) and threatened to kill me. Oh yeah. I was in a cult for Kevin Heart and thought he looked like Troy from High school musical. And he sent me on a journey to do… something, I do not remember what, this was a year ago and I cannot tell you what. My brother who loved WC was the dungeon master and it was just me and him.
you can be an asimar and be half jaiden half ari or arracocra and be fully humen shaped winged ari
i loved the collective “OHHHHHH” once they realized luaP was just Paul backwards
loved the Critical Role shout out...this was so much fun to watch, I'm glad you enjoyied your first session.
I got to watch this before I started playing Baldur’s Gate 3 today, and boy was I laughing with every moment XD  Also like the little cameo Keyleth, Vex’ahlia, Pike and Grog made, Critical Role is one of my favorite D&D groups
This was fun to watch! Makes me want to do a fun story line ❤
You weren’t just a Dragonborn, you were a draconblood dragonborn. Also, you should’ve had darkvision.
More more more more more more more
My IRL name is Ella, so the first thing I did was scream ‘THATS ME’ outloud
Jaiden is a Fuckin gremlin I love it
In the same room with the legends of vox machina
That was INSANITY please do another one XD
Why does Paul look like Larry tho?
Definitely do an extended campaign I opened one up for my school and anyone can join and so basically one of my friends like just insta died cause  one of my other friends who was currently fighting him rolled 20
That was completely unhinged and I love it, hilarious
Loved the Vox Machina party at the opening tavern XD
My uncle actual worked on the sets of the dnd movie so its nice to see one of my favourite yts make a video on it!
Finally u posted
"Ronboo"
This was amazing! I am so happy that D&D is spreading so much fun and joy, and also quite frankly chaos! I heavily appreciate the usage of the Pokémon Rangers and the Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga music 👍 The Command spell being used to deliver "Depression" is golden XD
I’ve run this one-shot three times- once as DM twice as a player. It’s a great starting place and it sounds like your DM spiced it up nicely and you all played it great!
1:15 VOX MACHINA!
What a coincidence, I always starting my first campaign in a couple weeks lol
If I had a nickel every time a youtubers dnd game had a Walmart manager as the main villain I’d have 2 nickels what isn’t a lot but it’s weird it happened twice.
0:30 Jokes on you, I’m not subscribed, and no, I don’t think we’d get along either.  You may call me boring, but as with a oujiboard, if I were EVER to play a D&D session with anyone, I would make sure to ask beforehand that they take it 100% seriously, otherwise I’M not playing.  “Let loose and have fun” you may say, but I want an epic adventure, not a comedic one.
Them laughing at Jaiden after she LITERALY KILLS THE GUY WITH ACID AFTER TRANSFORMING INTO HIS WIFE WAS THE MOST PSCYCOTHIC THING I HAVE EVER SEEN. Jaiden this might be one of the most funniest videos like EVER. Please more like this one😂😂😂
That was everything good about tabletop gaming, I'm glad you had fun!
One of my friends ran a one-shot that used that sheep opening.  It was a good time.
SHE DID IT, SHE PLUGGED HER OWN CHANNEL!
make a part 2 to save the cat of his curse!!!
I did not even watch the video yet and I know this is gonna be my favorite video.........well at least until Jaiden plays Dragon Ball Xenoverse and fan fictions herself a namek girl.
WE NEED THIS AS A SERIES OR SOMETHING, ITS AWESOME
THE CR REFERENCE AT 1:16 YAY
Not Mark dealing with depression 😂 I can't lmao
LOVED IT!!! D&D RULES!
Ah dungeons and dragons where you have to imagine having fun
I am a dnd dm (dungeon master)
more dnd content plz
AMAZING VIDEO So glad you posted again your so good and I love your art style!
Does Paul intentionally look like Larry from pokemon? Cause that fits.
I love how u drew the characters :]
That animation is amazing
Paul is just blonde Larry from Pokemon 😂❤
in one of my friend's campaigns they married 5 different demons including satan and then all of those demons died  Edit: the fact that Ranboo is a cat
Love the Over the Garden Wall names for the turt :))
MAGIC MISSILE…. oh I rolled a 1….
It is hard to enjoy an re-tell of a D&D story. The main part in enjoying D&D is see/hearing the roll(s) they get to see how well everything will go, and hearing the DM & players react to it. So hearing thing just sounds like you are telling a fantasy store and not at all a recap of you're D&D adventure. I would say if you all recorded the even to animate clips from the game play.
I lost it at: Zut pulls back just a bit to look at Mark's eyes which are sparkling with tears and proceeds to acid blast him POINT BLANK from the mouth 😭🤷‍♂️💀
I need part 2
Bro play Deep Rock Galactic
Best content you've made, was so good
The Mario Galaxy theme reference when Marc is hugging his ex wife. 🫶
DEPRESSION!!!!!!!
I remember that acid breath kiss, also depressed sales man is the quintessential DnD class, can't go wrong with it
Does anyone know what the music used at the end is called?
The moment the sheep came in... I KNEW EXACTLY what was going to happen for the rest of the video. God I love D&D.  EDIT: The Wild Sheep Chase adventure is a classic. One of the first games I played in to. EDIT 2: I have been deceived, bamboozled, and possible made a lapse in judgement. EDIT 3: How could I forget the classic "Game Master makes their own twist on existing stuff." Looks like it was a bit of Wild Sheep Chase but with a lot more stuff added. Regardless Seems like everyone had a fun time!
This was literally so amazing! ❤
Paul = Nanami Kento
This was SO much fun to watch!! one of my favorite videos you've made, I think - what a fun campaign!! Thank you for sharing this with us :D
IThis is the drug trip we didn't know we needed. .😅😂
I love how you can tell exactly who got a good or bad roll, very nice!
do more dnd stuff!!! that was awesome!!!
sick
Vox machina reference 💪🏻🙌🏻
this was fire as fuck
Aww the bird wasn’t in it
YOYOYOYO DND TIMEEEE
Brooooo My DND character is also a Dragonborn 🔥
And yet another one joins the D&D hivemind. Jokes aside, I'm happy to see you're enjoying the hobby as well, Jaiden. Would love so see a collab between you and DingoDoodles! That would be AWESOME!!!
As an avid D&D player I really enjoyed watching this especially when you pushed Ranboo forward when the riddle door asked who’s next.  I hope you decide to do more of these videos in the future and I’m definitely looking forward to watching more adventures of Jaiden the Dragonborn.
on my first day of my first ever dnd campain, me and my party walkked into a cave, proceeded to try looking behind a waterfall getting rubbish rolls on my D20-I even got blinded by trying to see what was behind it. We went into a path and there was a fork in the road, there was a very dark, ominous and gloomy path and a bright fluffy inticing path. We obviously went the dark path. We were met by a goblin on an armoured crossbow thingy. My friend tried to eldritch blast it but tripped over a rock and blasted the wall. I tried to tell it we came in piece. It shot us down.
JAIDEN IM SO SORRY BUT THE DRAGONBORN AS THE FIRST TIME RACE IS JUST SO FUNNY HOW TRUE IT IS
I am now very interested in d and d. Did u play on Xbox or bord?💜
furry??????????
That Vox Machina reference *amazing*
This was awesome.
PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER VIDEO FOR THE NEXT SESSION THIS IS THE BEST LAUGH IVE HAD IN A WHILE!!!!
THAI WAS SO GOOD I LOVE THSI PLEASE MAKE MORE WITH THE GROUP!!!
OMG LOVED IT! maybe make more vids like this?
Aight but if everyone is game PLEASE stream the second session I would watch tf outta that
I've had some interesting DND sessions before but that one takes the cake lol.
I want to see Ari as a Dragon now 😂
So are we not going to talk about the fact that Paul is just Larry? No?
part 2 when >=))))))))))))))))))
The Vox Machina reference in the beginning!!
Noice Vox Machina
I just found out there's a Pokémon FireRed Rocket edition, where you play the game as a team rocket member, I would love to see you make a game play with that game🤩❤️
I'm so glad you came to the community!
A fantastic animation of a fantastic adventure! I hope if you do more DnD games we'll see more animations like this but if not I'm just glad you had a fun introduction to the game.
I love how you can tell when one of them got a nat 20 and a nat 1 😂
Thank you Jaiden for bringing all of our imaginations to life in this animation!!! I really love thinking of all the scenarios we’ve been in while playing D&D and it was so fun to watch your animation for this one shot!!
I LOVE ALPHARAD IS LARRY OMFG😂😂
One time my dad ran a game where I had a magical cube that could literally do ANYTHING when I use it. I used it in the middle of a post-apocalyptic gunfight and I instantly lost my ability to use a firearm. I had a level 8 firearms skill that went down to a 2, I think. I went from being able to shoot a small target in the dark 30ft away behind me to being very likely to shoot myself in the foot. I grew to hate that goddamn cube, it ruined my life.
Part 2 maybeeeeeeeee?
Poor Paul 😂
more no more words
Plz play more d&d
This just makes me wanna play D&D even more but I don't have any friends to play with 😭 amazing video
I love that you used the Zelda music and that vox machine were in the opening tavern haha
That was actually an amazing DND story my friend ended up doing it at one point and it was chaos.
LMAO loved the Vox Machina easter egg
my favorite jaiden video of all time
I REMEMBER THE DISGUISE PART! BRUTAL! This was fantastic, loved this story so much! Also love love love the Vox Machina cameo!
holy shit that was hilarious
I love that alpharad is just a sad businessman barbarian
I like how alphrads character looks like Larry from Pokémon violet
at 6:24 its a bat for sure
4:15 that creature in the background looks like the Beast from over the garden wall
I wish I had friends to play D&D.
This video is funny and great and jaiden is awesome
slime came up with the eating clea im i correct
ah yes  ronboo
You have to make more d and d videos there so good and funny plus the animation.😂
This was amazing
... Now I know why the sheep's had to die in and fools gold....
average dnd campaign be like
in my opinion I think the best part about it is the imagination that goes into the video and how it shows you what adventures lie ahead of that journey. It's very beautiful and very very nice in my opinion.
This was the greatest thing I have ever seen
Also, damn that's a cool party
Same I just tried it recently
It’s soo fun thank you for the video
Yeah, sounded like peak D&D shenanigans. Glorious.
omg this was my fav video in years.
haha 1:16 vox machina ;)
“Don’t listen to him he’s a zebra” DOOR YOUR CANCELLED
HELP WHY IS ALPHARAD BASICALLY NANAMI or LARRY/AOKI
What!? When did this start? I love dnd and I'm currently making dungeon tiles and went to put on a video so I just wrote dnd and find this! Thanks🙃
paul is the best character
Oh jaiden. You just went down a very deep rabbit hole… AND NOW YOU NEVER COMING OUT ALIVE! Welcome to the world of D&D!
ONE OF US ONE OF US
Nothing beats playing games with your unhinged friends
The goblins were cooking the ice king horse
The spirit tracks sound track  in the background slaps
I would love to play D&D but I don't really have anyone to play it with.  Also, my ADHD wouldn't allow it I'm thinking.
OH THAT RULES!!
Episode two please
9:50 is that the dumb poo brain horse from adventure time?
OMG i loved this ❤❤
the critical roll cameo XD
Jaiden really waited until 12.1 million subscribers to ask viewers to subscribe
RAM-paging? nice.
Oh my gosh that was dope, this was filled with emotions!
Omg the sheep one shot
of course Ranboo chose to be a catboy twink
Wait. If Mark's last name is Thompson, and his wife's name is ella... Ella Thompson?
yoooooo this is the best video I have seen in a while
Damn do I miss D&D. One day when school stops pushing me down and when I acquire friends, I shall definitely start playing again.
loved this, it should be a new series.
Please do a part 2 Pretty please
As chaotique as expeted
We still don’t know why Mike did was a terrible manager
No way Jaiden just did a critical role reference
jaidens dragonborne is before puberty as zoot has a tail still and therefore shouldnt be able to use a breath weapon
“Turtle final ans-IT’S A WORM!!!”
Love this!! ❤❤ please do more
FAT PONY NOOOOOO
I absolutely love Jaidens D&D character design :0
Love it!
this is fun
Why does everyone’s character gotta be a main character complex and give it a tragic/accident backstory
Power world: depression
Wait what about the cat’s timeloop?
Alpharad just made himself in a alternate world where he never got into youtube.
This was sick!!! I'd love to see more Jaiden DnD Adventures!!!
Didnt Paul throw his child across the room twice
more please c:
naaaaah the character i use rightnow is a dragonbron rogue i would have swiped that stink
i would give ANYTHING to watch all of them play Baldur's Gate 3 🙏
this was the best video i ever watched
Wait… Is ranboo tabaxi still stuck in the timeloop?? Imagine him waking up  in the morning the day after just to see hes still cursed lol
I played dnd once with my brother and friends, unfortunately the former developed a certain…fetish. Here’s a hint: it rhymes with olden bower. I can’t. I just can’t.
Oh my god I love this ANOTHER EPISODE PLEASE
jaiden alpharad ranboo and Charlie is the crossover I never knew I needed
Did Slimecicle realize Alpharad is basically Larry?
If you ever have any more DND stories I 100% WILL TUNE IN!
We NEED more PLeeaaaseee
Ladies and gentlemen,  we've got another one.
This was absolute amazing and makes me want to play even more so badly
More... MORE... MORE!!!
OMGGGGG I AM SO EXCITED TO DO MINE EITH FRIENDS!!
As a fellow D&D enjoyer, that was freaking amazing! I'm glad you had fun!!
Lol I’m sure everyone can attest to making their first character a cute lil edgelord loner
you have inspired me to do a d&d game
pls do another I loved it
I fucking loved this video so much holy shit this was amazing!!!
Can you make another dungeon and dragon episode I really like that one so you can make another one please
WE NEED MORE OF THIS!
I want to see character sheets for all of them.  I know the tabaxi is a bard. Paul is either a fighter or a barbarian. WTF is Zoot? I think wild magic sorcerer, but I don’t know…
Wish i could play DND, but alas its really hard to find someone to play with in my town. And doing it through internet isnt the greatest (Neither do i have the social skills to go around asking)
DnD copyright claims the video.
Thats crazy
Is that the horse from adventure time
That was an unexpected ending
HAHHAHA I'M ALWAYS TRYING TO CONVINCE MY FRIENDS RANBOO IS JUST LIKE A CAT! THEY CAN'T DENY IT NOWW
Woow, good video. You could do a video of your trip to brazil?
Kira yoshikage ass speech 💀 1:42
I love the use of bowser's castle from superstar saga. (and other songs from superstar endgame)
If I had a nickel for every time a DnD game featured Walmart, I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. The other being YouTuber DougDoug. Kickflipping wizard!
Moooooore!!
i want to play dnd so bad but I have no idea how or where to start this was so cool and ranbo's character is so cute
love this so much
Alpha looks like Larry form Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
Super fun video!!! Part 2??
i always thought the idea of d&d was super weird but oddly intriguing... isn't it just... playing pretend? i could never... i'd be so embarrassed and just constantly think "i'm an adult... wtf am i doing..." it does look kinda fun but i'd be way too worried about being judged for... anything or just being laughed at in general because i'd be an adult playing pretend...
:D
as someone who just got into dnd a week ago due to my friends indoctrinated, this video made my day lmao
Best video ever, you'll always be my favorite YouTuber
Pfft, nice job turning Jacob into Larry!
That dragon in the end... is that a reference to Dingo Doodles dnd campaign? I might be looking wayyy into it tho
Omg please team up with Jocat. It will be an epic d&d quest. Funny mostly. His D&d crap guides are brutally funny.
WAS ALPHARAD JUST LARRY FROM POKEMON SCARLET AND VIOLET?!?! also I'm totally drawing ranboos character
The mutual OHHHHH at Luap switching is what really sent me over lmao
I loved this SO MUCH!!! The plot, the Zelda soundtrack, the D&D... all of it was perfect <3
OMGGGGG I love DND but adding in Vox Macina at the beginning made me SCREAMMM
When i played dnd i felt like everyone else enjoyed it way more than i did.  Later, i found out i have aphantasia. Which definitely does not help.
One time my party summoned Scooby Doo and attached a bomb to him to go blow up what we thought was a mimic
The fact that maiden made Paul look like Larry from Pokémon is golden.
I was playing with my cousin and ate a crystal (that's normal) and he was sick of it he was just like "the crystal was drugs. " BRYSON WHAT-
0:44 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
0:42 it begins.
Mark: “NO ONE WILL STOP ME!!!”  “DEPRESSION!!” Mark:😭😭😭
this makes me have strongest dire urge to play DND now, thank you
CAN WE PLZZZZZZ SEE MORE DND CONTENT
OH MY GOD I LOVED THIS
I like how the only human is an unhappy 40 year old man
so did ranboo ever get out of the time loop or (i guess it wasn't mark who cursed him because he said that was a rumour)
If you need any help Jaiden just ask I know a lot about dnd have been playing for three years now
Loved it! Hope to see more DND videos too😂
1:50 MY NAME IS YOSHIKAGE KIRA, I AM THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD.
That was epic! I love dnd and this was cool to watch
9:54 THE HORSE COSTUME FROM ADVENTURE TIME 😳😳😳😳😳
Now not only poketubers but dnd YouTubers will make reaction videos on Jaiden.
YESSSSSSS I LOVE DND :DD
"I roll to fuck it"
This was amazing! I want more animations of Jaiden playing different TTRPGs.
I love this video so much, please make more dnd videos Jaiden!!
i'm happy you enjoy dnd hmhm, it is a great game
Was like fools gold realy cool!!
5:28 "rehab was supposed to be a fresh start"
Casting command with the word "depression" is both hilarious and deplorable
the cougar was a whole ass jumpscare
OMG YES. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO DO THIS. YEEEEEESSSSSSS. PLS TELL JAMES TO PLAY THIS TOO :D
adventure time horse. at 9:50
I played with a couple friends once and played as a penguin with a pistol
Omgggg this was so cool
Best thing I have ever watched ❤
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
0:57 We have: •A Digimon •A depressed retired businessman •And a Straight up furry
More DnD content please!
I can't sit through a full campaign so I appreciate this dumbed-down version. I wish I could enjoy DnD but unfortunately whenever I try to play it I suffer bad anxiety attacks, so this will have to do.
1:15 VOX MACHINA
Vox machinaaaaa
Do more of these pls im sick of hearing about video games i dont know and never played:(
yes.
OMG PAUL IS LITERALLY LARRY FROM POKEMON S/V
awesome video
My friends started a dnd club at my school, very excited to play it for the first time!!
holy shit i’ve dmed this oneshot
What's the game?
1:14 Oh my gosh, Vox Machina 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This makes me want to play dnd now
15:26 i thought was going in to a completely different direction.
Wow, was this story just stupid, or is dnd actually trash.😂
Wait a sec, I don't remember seeing anything about the cat being cured from living the same day over-and-over again, hmmm. Other than that I thought this was great, I love it when D&D adventures are brought to life in animation.
Fantastic adventure, sounds great!
I really like that Clay sculpture encounter, Imma use that someday
Jaiden dnd warcrimes are even funnier here.
The fucking Turtle omg 😂
Love the super Mario emotional music when marks depressed
NOT THE BEAST FROM OTGW didn’t expect that and had to do a double take
once I was playing D & D and I started to talk to a frog on the side of the road, while my teamates were fighting Golbins. Then the frog turned into a person frog thingy and started to help us defeat the golbins. (he was terrible, never got one hit)
I WISH I COULD SEE THIS LIVE BETWEEN THE FOUR OF YOU
5:18 Alpha and I were thinking exactly the same thing!! XD  Also, Jaiden and Ranboo's characters are *ADORABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
lol D&D is awesome!  my hubby and I get together with my  brother and sister in-law, and another friend and play with my sister in-law's dad as DM. It's a riot!
I too hope you'll get to play more D&D, especially if it is with Alpharad in the party with you again.
I LOVE ITTTT DO MORE IF YOU WANT
omg so many OTGW REFERENCES: 4:15 the Beast does turtles count turtles  4:34 some of these are actually names like Mr. President, Jason Thunderburker, and George Washington are what Greg wants to give to the frog bonus Adventure time ice king horse 10:04
One on my game slapped an owl bear too death 🔥🔥🔥
I love Paul. I love the generic real life characters in a DnD fantasy theyre fun to play.
how am i the only person that finds this cringe
dragon born is my favrit when i play i always be a dragon born
I gotta say, this was just about the most perfect way a campaign began
This is why I love dnd. The unhingedness of each session is absolutely hilarious, and this video is no exception.
I love dnd so much but I can never play it because I don't have a group
This was so random, so beautiful, and should be made into a feature length film
It seemed like there were a lot of nat 1 rolled in this campaign.
1:14 VOX MACHINA MOMENT
That was a fun, funny video I loved it
love your vids jaiden even if a video would take a year i would still love your content!!!
I was so confused during the whole video 😂
Oh
this video was a nat 20 (or a lot of 1s rolled one ofter the other)
blows up tavern while casting speak to animal welp i guess we now know what class and subclass jaiden chose
Love the subtle inclusion of Vox Machina at 1:15
This is so hilarious I love this we need more🙏🏾
ooOOOOH PAUL JUNIOR!!! Crying. That was so sweet and funny omg
i'm a current dnd player; i can't really do it right now because i work at a haunt on the same night a dnd session ends up happening(a saturday), so i'm out of the campaign for awhile; so their way of taking me out of the story is by having my character(A half elf/half orc monk warlock werebear) be kidnapped by the BBEG(or group of BBEG's) called the highbloods
I love making my own character and doing dumb stuff, that’s why I play so many games where u can’t create ur own character
IM AN ASSISTANT MANAGER AT YEE OLD MART OF WAL
I would love to see more
15:28 Nah that’s cold I felt that one but funny tho I had to laugh
It’s such a fever dream to see my fav animator and fav gamer YouTubers collabing????? WHATTTTTTT INSANE
CRITICAL ROLE????? IN MY JAIDEN ANIMATIONS????????
Are the only one that noticed that Jacob’s character looked a lot like Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet?
imagine if jaiden made an entire dnd series, that would be a blast
i absolutely love your animations n story’s they really make my day i thank you for every video they always bring me joy❤
god i love -larry- paul
8:03 A TECHNOBLADE CROWN
This was really fun! Nice job
I will never not watch these! Please play more DnD and animate them this was absolutely hilarious!
5:17 my brain:oh wait i know this one! "Zaza"
"i'm a riddle door" you have earned my hatred
I <3 D&D
u should cap it at 10 mins/ep and make a season of this.
As somebody who is just getting into D&D and trying to learn all I can, fun one-shot animatics like this really seals the deal.
oh ok so jaiden is that troll player, i see XD
YES I looooooove dnd yes yes
I'd pay to see this made as a motion picture on the big screen.
Jacob would be the one to lore dump everything in a dramatic fashion
I don’t know why but seeing blonde Larry with a great axe is very funny to me
i dONT WANNA BE MARKS WIFE
The most unrealistic part was that the Walmart manager had never experienced depression. He should've had an usopp level resistance to it
Hey jadien im gonna be playing d and d on Wednesday i hope i meet a dragón
All my friends play d&d and i have never before. I am joing a campaign they are making though so itll be my first ever. I cant wait!
Adventure time horse!!
1:19 Love the Vax Machina reference ❤
Jaiden, I absolutely loved the use of Wind Waker soundtrack there ! It’s my favorite game and sometimes I stop to liste to the soundtrack, so  I recognized each part, bringing back the good old memories.
7:02 from then on its my fav part
10:38 ADVENTURE TIME HORSE
I think im going crazy but i swear i’ve heard of the dragon shapeshift acid part before bcs im getting MAD deja vu 😭
wonderful video <3 also absolutely adored the little vox machina in the inn they're such little guys
You should do a part two or something
Paul looks like Larry from Pokémon change my mind
om this campaing went realy weird real fast XD
Jacob’s character looking like Larry from S/V is sending me
I love the Vox Machina Easter egg :)
THE POINT BLANK ACID BLAST HAD ME IN TEARS BRO AHAHHAHAHAHAHH
Most cats are lactose intolerant
Omg alpharad is larry
That story had me from start to finish. From the audible gasp when the dark wizard turned out to be Mark, to the laughter of acid blasting his face at point blank, to the tears shed at Paul reuniting with his son. Amazing video, thank you for sharing!!
4:33 JOJO REFEREEEEEEEEENCE, also i wolud love to play DyD, love your vids jaiden and hope a get to be an animator like u😊😊
i would love more of these videos lol.
I wanna see y'all do a Pokemon DnD campaign
I was dying of laughter the whole time this was hilarious
Holy crap THIS WAS AMAZING
Would you consider doing any videos about Webcomics? I think that they could make a really interesting premise for a video, if yes than I suggest you try out some of the Foxglove Comics, I would recommend Tamberlane as a first read (since that's what I and most others started with)
I LOVE IT! THat was AWESOME!
15:22 Point blank acid move I was thinking bite off face but seems like the same thing😂😂
hahaha i remember that a while ago i sent a mensage to jaiden somewhere that if she wanted to play D&D with some friends of her, i would be willing to DM for her, but i dont think she saw that mensage, i'm glad she got herself a DM anyway <3
Vox Machina reference made me feel good
I think Paul Is a guy named Larry
I absolutely love this, but word of advice for DMs in the comments: plan a variety of ideas for natural 1s. How many god damn puddles are there and why is everyone always slipping on them
We played (roughly) the same one-shot with my regular group the other day, we were all barbarians and a warlock that ended up using the wand to turn himself into an adult dragon and murdered everyone (sheep and betraying wizard, here mark Thomson, included) but my character, who now exist in the background of the main campaign as a lonely barbarian dragonborn trying to kill the warlock-turned-dragon  Gods I love dnd 😂
1:03 innit
I LOVE THIS VIDEO. It’s so well made :)
Thst was awsome
As soon as the sheep with the scroll burs in I was like, "Hey, I've run this adventure before!"
DID ANYONE RECORD THIS?? I must see the chaos build
D&D  is so fun and I love it so much. Jaiden I really want to see more D&D content from you I think that'd be fun.
If I had a nickel for every time I'd seen one of my favorite youtubers feature a Walmart manager as the antagonist of their DnD campaign, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's still weird that it happened twice.
I’m slowly getting into D&D and would love to join a campaign, this was great, but why was this campaign so fascinated with worms lol
15:32 Charlie and Ranboo both laugh
The Vox Machina Easter egg right at the beginning LMAO 1:14
Awesome video.
Did… did… did Jacob steal Larry’s design?
0:57 Larry Jumpscare. Also dargon and as bezel would say KITTY
Ayoo, what are Vox Machina doing here!
lmao, this sounds like an adventure time episode xd
I really liked this. So cute xDD
I honestly was waiting until Jaiden did one of these! This was absolutely hilarious! 😂
Love the critical role reference
YOOOOOO YOU ADDED VOX MACHINAAAA!!!! That's fucking poggers
DO MOREW OF THESE PLEASE 🙏
BRO ALPHARAD HAD THE ENTIRE YOSHIKAGE KIRA SPEECH!
Really hope we get more of these.
Fellow dragonborn
D&D is always so much fun, especially when you’re with a psycho group. I mean my group just likes torturing everyone we meet I feel bad for our DM
This is your best video yet!
Is that the adventure time horse
9:12 AAUUGGGHHHHHHHH
Pls more
Thanks for the animation. This was hilarious! 😂
i love the alois like mark on her tounge
Bruh this video came back while me and my party were mid-session! PLZ MAKE MORE DND VIDEOS!
After that point blank acid blast I think he has trust issues 😂
PLEASE animate more DND sessions oh my god this is THE most entertaining thing
OMG I LOVE THIS, alsoooo Vox Machina spotted! AWESOME
"We found a turtle and... added it to our inventory!" With all the insane shit you were describing, somehow THAT was the thing that made me howl with laughter! It was just such a freggin random statement, I love it! xD
PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE
I dont know why, but you look great as a dragon-born
5:01 ain’t no way I just responded with amazon💀😭
Was that Keyleth and Vex at the beginning? 😂😂😂 oh and Grog and Pike haha
So excellant 10/10 , also do you know how to turn a person into a frog no reason. 🐸
Amazing vid! I would love to see more of this kind of stuff!
i can tell jaiden‘s been watching over the garden wall
This is so cool
4:15 - 4:34 so many over the garden wall references
My mom and dad play d&d and I love it too😂😅
DD is the best game in world ❤
Great video Jaiden! I laughed out loud at least 6 times watching this video. (All your videos make me lol) This one was especially good though. More of these style videos should make it to your channel. 🏆
Can you start telling funny stories again 😢
Wait no one gonna talk about how they forgot about PAUL JR. THE ||.
THIS WAS AMAZING!! pls do more dnd videos
Alpha WOULD play larry in dnd, i love it
Not the depression spell 😭
I also just got into d&d recently
YOU NEED TO DO THIS AGAIN
This dnd was very unhinged, I love it.
10:04 adventure time references
My favorite part is "and you! PAUL!" and then moving on.
Alternative name for this video: The Ender dragon, Larry from pokemon and two-face go on an adventure together
I wish my old D&D group was this fun as 2000% less hyper fixated on the so called "culture wars"
I was a little girl my friends invited me to their house to do a dnd game and I couldn’t couldn’t go
don’t think we didn’t see the vox machina cameo at 1:13 😏
Paul looks like he about to not give me my gym badge
OMG I LOVE THIS 🥰
This was so fun. I hope you do more DnD stories
Jacob playing as Larry Pokémon is so on brand and I love it
Imagine your DnD campaign is animated by Jaden! Maaaannn what a privilege
Hi
I thought you were going to talk about the paranormal order
amazing, I didn't stop laughing !
I want more of these!  Keep going!
Actually one time my friends was playing D&D and they invited me to play with them and they actually helped me for like 1/4 of the game then like I was bassicly the oddoneout,but seeing this video I’m so glad I’m not the only person who did this you did it much better then I now I understand btw your vids are awsome:D
I've watched this video 4 times now. Do I need help?
hell yeag
NOOO!!!! THE DOOR!!!! R.I.P main character bronze door
*Just casually watching a D&D video* 1:15 - IS THAT VOX MACHINA REFERENCE????????????
ZIKA!!!
Alpharad (Paul) looking like Larry from Pokémon is hilarious! Also, some aspects of this story really remind me of The Owl House
Heh. Nice Worms ref
i loved this video, it was so funny and made me have laughing fits multiple times
Ok but like top 10 videos ever, Charlie's ideas for this campaign were so good
This should be an episode of a show have you considered making a Netflix cartoon????
Please tell me there's a vod and maybe next sessions?? This was hellarious especially Jaiden point blank acid blast someone in the face 😂😂
I play D&d and it’s so fun
yep, Screw Wizards of the Coast. Dragonborns have Tails!
“And immediately acid blasts him point blank from The mouth” ❤
JAIDEN IS SOOOO FREACKING MADE TO PLAY DND so many adventures to be drawn
That was such a good video!
Gamin
You can’t hide those refrences of dnd characters from other dnd groups I am too much of a nerd to be tricked >:)
Oh shit? Dingo Doodles on notice? I kid.  I'm just happier than ever to have even more people willing to animate their D&D adventures into episodic retellings.
This needs a part 2
Amazing : Dnd plus jaiden animation ! What do you want more people ? Spleeping ? Working ? Ah
That was AMAZING!!!!!!!  Loved every second of it  U and every1 who took part in this dnd are amazing content creators  Lov u all
Command: depression was incredibly dark but I laughed so hard, then the follow up where you disguised yourself as his wife just to acid breath him was so unexpected and brilliant.
We NEED more of this because this is hilarious. An enemy saying "It's __ing time!" is the peak of D&D dialogue.
JAIDEN IS SUZIE FROM DELTA RUNE THATS AMAZING
This is dingo doodles but VERY goofy
Omg, I love how u can tell that Charlie is the door
Paul so long gay Bowser'd his own son. How could he...
That was awesome! Hell yeah!
Omg bruh this exact scenario happened to me when I started dnd and I’m also a dragonborn
there are just random people doing this kinda thing for fun??! Why doesnt hollywood pull these people in to make some real stories!
The Critical Role Vox Machina reference in the inn was wonderful! It's always fun to see Critters around :D
9:53 there's the weird horse from adventure time lmao
I LOVE THIS
I love the references to Shrek and The Legend of Vox Machina in the first minutes xD
If you made session 2 can I join 😂
I luv Ramboos cat OC!
Kkkkkkkkkk noway alpharad made Larry from pokemon sv
so beautifully stupid xD
1:15 Vox Machina reference ❤️
1:16 Vox machina!
This so chaotic, I love it
Now this is content
Я люблю DnD
I just gotta say, I absolutely adore the mario and luigi superstar saga music :)
Man jacob really love larry
I once played a my hero academia roleplay and before we met the villian someone in my party sufficed him but it turned out he was a literal child

omg the vox machina cameo 🥺
“So paul so long gay bowsers the sheep” way too funny😭😭
Love this video
Over the Garden Wall fan perhaps?
I love how jaden made alpharad’s character look like Larry from pokemon
this was so funny like alpharad and ranboo have a goal and Jaiden just tagged along for some reason
This was awesome content, would love to see more
Alpharad is just larry
i love how you can tell when the rolls just didnt go well, like the axe boomerang or that one goblin always missing to their demise. classic dnd right there
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lmao I love the scene where they all laughed <3333
. . . and then it all resets because Tholamew is still under the Groundhog Day time-loop
Jaiden has me sitting like I'm listening to a story when I was in kindergarten! Love it and thanks!
The cat is dead because it is lactose
Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Nothing like a memorable D&D experience.
Who saw the Naruto Shippuden reference?
help my a keyfell of idkwhy its working lso i brokemy spce key
THE VOX MACHINA CHARACTERS AT THE BEGGING
I’m so happy that Bobby made it In the video <3333
I need more of this in my life lol
This made me cry 16:57 😢
Jacob has become Larry
why is Paul just...Larry lmfao this is gold.
I‘d love to see more of that
This was an amazing video, I hope you will make more D&D videos in the future. This is genuine gold.
It's VOX MACHINA!!!!!! OMFG!!!
"Command would: depression" How did I never think of that? :v
I've been playing D&D for a few years now, so seeing one of my favorite Youtubers get into it is really exciting!
was 13:40 a reference from naruto shippuden of Tobi?
her portrayal of slimcicle...terrifying and yet completely accurate
14:08 D E P R E S S I O N
The kitty is too cute
I love that Vox Machina was in the tavern at the start
Rancat
I loved that! That was so cute omggg
Am I the only nerd on the planet who thinks d&d is the most boring waste of time imaginable?
There was vox machina at the inn!!
I love how you casually said ranboo
Oh hi there friend
I’ll be back for season 2!
Using the word depression with the command spell literally floored me that’s so funny
I loved this video! Please do more D&D videos! They’re so fun! ❤
Didn't expect to see Vox Machina cameo. So funny. I love this. Do more, Jaiden.
Loved this video! ❤
Jacob alfarad
great choice in music in the background 💀 loving.. ALL of this
9:16 no more wormbing time? 😢
Why does alpharad look like Larry from Pokémon
Omg Jason Funderbirker, Greg, Benjamin Franklin Wirt, George Washington and Mr. President as turtle name options are perfect, I love OTGW
This is like an episode of Adventure Time and I love it! PLEASE KEEP DOING THIS
i dont like u but this vid was awesome in a not bad way
If you think THIS story was crazy, then prepare to hear some of MINE! So here is the thing, I was playing in a different setting, the one with a Pyramid and you explore the pyramid. I was also a Dragonborn named “Dracsgro” (I had no name ideas so deal with it) for my first time so cool, but I was also a monk. Story 1: Me and the rest of the people were exploring like the basement of the pyramid, and then we opened a trap door and a bunch of bats came out shaping a bigger bat(?), and he killed everyone except for me. Then (in real life) I rolled a 20, which means something really good happens, and my dungeon master saw that could not explain how to fit it IN GAME! So I will just call it the “overpower-no-jutsu”, and because of it it decreased harshly the number of bats presented. And one of my friends revived and killed it… yaaaaaaay! Story 2: Me and the rest of the people were exploring even deeper the basement of the pyramid, and there was this place with a door in front of us and a hallway to the left. I choose to go alone on the pathway to left, and literally THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN I STEP IN THE HALLWAY WAS GETTING HIT BU A TRAP THAT WAS LIKE AN AXE THAT SWING HORIZONTALLY! WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF A RANDOM HALLWAY HAVING TRAPS!!!! Any may mean while the rest of the people were fighting a bunch of skeletons and loosing badly, like everyone was dying (except of course me), and you know what I did? *[WARNING: the following strategy might be so smart that your brain will not manage how genius that was]* I PLAYED DEAD, and they left me alone, so I could stabilize my self and the rest of the party. Genius I know.
I love dnd!... I have nothing else to say.
This is why I love D&D  As always, your animations were exceptional. This had so much personality and so many funny visual gags with how you depicted the events of the campaign. I would LOVE more D&D content from you if it's something you had fun making!
What homebrew rules did your DM have that allowed all these team-up attacks?
1:41 Another D&D adaptation of Wal-Mart.  Someone might be a DougDoug fan.
I am at the beginning a Of the episode I’m about 100% sure that sheep is his lost son
The second that Luap was revealed I audibly said "PAUL THREW HIM" with my jaw agape.
Alpharad really was just Larry 😂😂😂
I rember playing dnd and it started with me punching a goblin I the groin and then saving my party from a dragon verry drastic changes I situations lol
Oh no no no no honey don’t please honey 🍯 ❤ don’t play it aging 😊 plz 😮 don’t u will lose so much money time and energy 😢oh darling don’t 😂
I’m glad your finally giving it a shot. As a dnd lover I just know your journey has only begun
I love the Vox Machina reference
"IT'S WORMIN' TIME" I CAN'T
I watched this hours ago and JUST NOW realized Ranboo was bongo cat.
omg spotted vox machina!! another fun video by u, thank you for all the effort u put into ur videos 🫶🏻
Always love dnd animated videos Hope to see more in the future!
My love for D&D went up by 10 times.
Great video. Can't wait for the next one
I love how alpha is just a 45 year old going through his 3rd divorce
Ion even know where to get dnd 😢
PLEASE tell me the whole campaign was recorded. I'd kill to hear the whole thing.
Oh my goodness im so exited we got jaden to DND
BRO RANBOO’S CHARACTER LOOKED SO GOOD!
I LOVE DND OMGG
Alpharad character looks like Larry
"Depression" is officially my new favorite use of a command spell lol.
I love it! Sounds like you all had a blast.
Heh nice Vox Machina cameo. Nice seeing Kiki, Grog and The others chilling out at a random tavern.
I feel like not understanding what’s going on during a campaign is like a canon event in DnD
PART 2!!!!!!
the greatest final boss, MARK THOMPSON!!!
I love how you turned Alpharad to Larry from Scarlet and Violet 😂
You know what I want Jaden to play undertale than animate it
WHY IS APLHA LARRY
I remember them playing this live so to see it animated was really awesome 😍 🤭
Gosh i hope there'll be more DnD vids, that was wonderful QwQ
1:15 ok, you might be new to dnd, but you know how to make us critters squeal with glee!
I’m begging you do a dnd livestream
nice video
SESSION 2 SESSION 2 SESSION 2
Hearing the guys laugh at the acid blast thing was HILARIOUS 😂😂💙 also, I did NOT realise luap was Paul backwards LMAOOO
Thats not how disguise self works the spell gets nullified once any living being comes in contact with you the manager should have seen right through you once he looked into your eyes after the hug
I definitely hope this becomes serialized!
This is my new favorite jaiden video, it was so well animated and so much fun, please do more like this
I knew this would be a great vid
I didn’t understand a single thing that happened in this video but still watched Still tryin to figure out why 💀
I play it and wizard is one of the best class in dnd
PUH-LEASE MAKE MORE DND VIDEOS I DONT KNOW HOW TO PLAY AND I LOVE WATCHING THESE
Is charlie literally just sanji?😭
can't wait to play as a ceo in this game
time of laugh: 0:18
aww, poor Poo Brain. He didn't deserve to be thrown on a spit and eaten by a bunch of goblins
Jacob is just Larry from pokemon scarlet and violet.
Another Enjoyable campaign story. With my favorite flavor too, Unexpected confusion.
I can't believe Jaiden cast "Power Word: Depression" on the wizard lololol
Oh my god... Yes D&D, I mean its not for everybody, but its pretty enjoyable when you get into playing
The moment that sheep burst through the window I recognized that one-shot story. Excellent choice, Charlie.
*DEPRESSION!!*
i see that Vox machima reference👀👀
ITS WORMIN TIME killed me😂😂😂🤣🤣
🤦🏽‍♀️ I love the idea of ur DM just rolling with it when u take ur metal tipped stick A.K.A. a mace, n tried to pepper spray someone with it. Next I’m waiting for u to pull a club out n than beat someone to death in a dance battle, or for u to bow in respect to everyone u r about to throw an arrow at, or bury someone under an army of warhammer minis, or pulling out ur mail to bite someone’s face off.
Please please please do more of this!!!
This was amazing please do more like this
I love how at 9:52 the goblins are roasting a horse that was the costume of Ice King from that one adventure time episode 😂
THE DEPRESSION COMMAND SPELL LMAO
Hi Jaiden  you probably won’t see this but it’s m dream to do what you do when I’m older so I hope my dream comes true in a couple years I’ve been watching u since I was 8 ang ur my idol thanks for making m childhood 👍🐀🦃
Jaiden is a furry confirmed!
Dragonborn buddies!
Oh this is gonna be fun.
I love the Critical Role Vox Machina reference!
THIS WAS SO GOOOD HSHDBABSBS PLEASE DO MORE
ITS SO FUCKING COOL TO SEE THIS ANIMATED WITH THE SOUND EFFECTS  13:41
This was a great video but I have to ask what happened to Paul Jr the turtle at the end
Now I wanna see a Jaiden Animations movie/TV show even more. I mean really, it feels like Jaiden could be the one to make a YouTuber production that actually has undeniable quality behind it.
4:15 love the over the garden wall reference
This video was amazing please make more I have already seen it 3 times. stunning animations.
The end ò the video is so sick
Honestly, I would love to see more of this.
Theory for the story, paul is secretly evil, the child ran away for a reason, he planted the sheep which is why it stopped only for him, he made himself a minion he cannot understand so wants to possess a dragon born to create an animal army and start a assassin crime gamg murdering anyone he doesn't like  Edit:  he wants to sacrifice his half fae or fairy child to create infinite minions, but he's too slippery. He murdered his wife for his summoning power to increase, now all he needs is 1 more, and half fae children are rare, which is why he just made one himself. The reason why he didn't just kill the infant was cause he needed to wait for him to get him magic, but when he started chasing the kid teleported himself to another plain or area Time loop guy mistook ranboo for one of his animal lackeys so cursed him to prevent evil deeds feom taking place  The reason why the sheep is taking them to all these places is to weaken them, and then they'll be taken after a while to the alter where the dragon born will fight and lose, and the cat develops a mysterious illness, he's just poisoned. He wants him around to trace back the curse to the guy and his crew to kill them all, they're the only resistance to his mad scheme to become an unstoppable evil ruler  The reason why there's that foot print is cause the resistance have planned multiple hit and runs, they're very difficult to locate, causing our guy Paul to need a more direct way of tracking them, but he needs the cats trust in order to complete the spell
Hi
WAIT A FUCKING MINUTE
Hear me out hear me out: DnD channel, and you can just animate the whole session (like in little sections)
This all absolutely reeks of beginner's intro to dnd. Hope you have fun playing more campaigns in the future.
just came out of The Odd's one's new video, now i want to say what i feel YOU ARE AMAZING, JADEN     :D
Help I have watched this 7 times in 3 days  Edit: 8
W vid
I hope we see more dnd stuff from you jaiden XD
This reminds me of my fist time😂
your inpresstion are really good im a guy and when i do a girl voice you can tell it is fake you make it work thought
Asking for a friend: what’s the outro theme?
I wanna play dnd but don't know anyone willing to play with me
This party is literally just Kris, Susie, and Ralsei from deltarune
Ah, dragonborn. Good choice. I was a dragonborn my first time playing d&d, just because I thought they looked cool lol.
Werid horse from adventure time?
POWER WORD: DEPRESSION
Disguise self into point blank acid breath. That's D&D for ya.
this is perfect
15:32 This was genuinely a hilarious part . Those sounds of laughter just came out of nowhere all of a sudden 🤣🤣🤣
Im so proud of myself for actually guessing Zebra for the first riddle 😂
12:36 SO LONG GAY BOWSER
YIPEEE
4:16 the creature with antlers is most definitely The Beast from Over the Garden Wall.
This was amazing
Over the garden wall reference? 4:15
I actually play DND as well I’m a werewolf warlock barbarian
Omg yes
Delightful stuff, especially that clutch _command._ Glad you had such an incredible first D&D session. Also, Alpharad playing as Larry the Barbarian is pitch-perfect.
paulmart for life, bitches
The Vox Machina reference made me way too happy…
I love the adventure time horse being cooked XD
Is that vox machina in the tavern?!
I was once a gold dragon born monk named Bilbo Swaggons
I don't know how it's possible that every single dnd campaign I've seen ever has so much stupid stuff happen. This is why dnd is the best
Aw man, I hope this becomes a thing
Awesome. I would watch more of these.
Within the first 10 seconds of the recap  there's already a Vox Machina reference.  I'm impressed
1:14 GROG TIME
The acid blast point blank to the face was great 😅😅😅
4:15 im loving the little OTGW reference with The Beast being in the background🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
9:13 lol
… I need more
Loved the Over the Garden Wall references!
YESSSSS IT WAS SUCH AGOOD VIDEO JAIDEN!!!!❤ And i misst ypu so much i was waiting almost evry day for anohter Video of your (sorry that my englich isnt that good  )
I absolutely loved this 😂
You know I always wanted to get into dungeons and dragons but it just seemed like so much rules and it seemed so confusing but seeing this kind of makes me want to do it I’m a little more interested.
You 100% need to do this again, this video was utterly awesome.
this is so on brand for a one shot
I like that alpharad is larry
HE MADE LARRY?!
I love how you drew Alpharad’s character is just Larry
Why would someone wanna become human when ur sheep u can have a cult of the sheep 🐑
THIS WAS INCREDIBLE JAIDEN 💜💜💜
I absolutely love Paul as a character idea. Sick of working for a corporation. Starts adventuring. I may have to do this.
M O R E .
DRAGON BORN!
cute <3
1:14 Vox Machina! :D
I LOVE THIS HAHA🤣
ok but the "depresion" attack was the best one
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!
This is great 👍🏻 I enjoy these types of videos and the animation that occurs. Ii hope there are more of these DND vids in the future ❤
you should watch Tales from The Stinky Dragon.
I almost got tears when  the manager started crying and then jaiden just blasting him poin blank cracked me up lmao
4:15 is that The Beast from Over the Garden Wall I see? Nice reference!
The vox machina characters omg
This was hilarious!
I once played a mad scientist character and I had high Charisma I stabbed an enemy with a syringe that was filled with water or something and I stabbed the enemy and lied say I just gave him and cancer and it worked💀
!! I've played this campaign before! It's so fun!!
i am taking a dnd class so this video caught my atenton
D&D is really poorly made, I suggest playing anything else tbh.
dnd is literally f around and find out the game
can you make part 2 dungeons and dragons
Why does alpard look like Larry
I just realized jaiden missed a couple frames 15:28 w
Dragon Jaiden's design sparks so much joy omfg 😂
Riddle Door: "Z to A--" Me: A zebra!     Hey, I got it right. Yay! Also, 'answer me these questions three?' I know what storytime video that's from, if that's meant to be a reference to it. Anyway, amazing video, and amazing animation, well done, Jaiden! I really hope you'll do more of these!
To quote Chris Farley in Tommy Boy, “That…was…AWESOME!!!” Definitely an amazing intro to D&D. Welcome to the family!
THE WORLDS SMALLEST VIOLIN
Nobody gonna say that Vox machina was casually chatting in the tavern?
beep im a sheep i said beep im a sheep
THIS WAS SO COOL AHHHHHH
You should totally do this again.
Luap thrashing the bar before the scroll blows it up is too good
I love how Paul is portrayed as a blonde version of Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. That's just an extra dash of hilarious to me.
SaTaNiC!!!!! AhHhHhHhHhHhHHHHHhhhhH! dnd is epic, and this party is crazy stacked awesome vid
Nah, don’t tell me Alpharad’s character is based off Larry
I love D&D! This was great 🤣
A vox machina reference is crazy
Man, I really whanna play it now. And worst part, IDK where or how to get it.
Now I want more ❤
D&D character names are actually the names of the stranger things monsters
XD oh it is that story. i believe you animated this as a short but with different names or something
10:14 thats the same pony in adventure time that kept fin and jake up but it was the ice king nice refrence!
WHOOO!!
1:15 JAIDEN YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! It was such a jumpscare. geez.
Love the critical role cameos in the beginning! My husband and I are critters
I absolutely love how creative you can get with DnD. We are currently in a campaign that is based on Squid Games. On the first session, my character (essentially my dog which gives off barbarian vibes) managed to befriend a giant hamster.
RIP to all the GMs who will have to suffer a new flood of ADHD addled zoomies who this video tricked into thinking the regular/ideal game of D&D is similar to this.
Alpharad looks like Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
DUDE! THIS WAS AWESOME! and man... Jacob being that one gym leader from Pokémon? That cracked me up hahaha
"Ellen.... is that you?"
i want to play dnd one day so bad but no idea who to play with and where to start wish i had someone slimecile tbh
I currently am DMing 4 campaigns  :)  A Merchant Campaign (party owns a Rum Brewery and Potion Shop, trying to appease pirates and the zany guards)  2 Celestial Planeswalker Campaigns (Lots of portal theory shenanigans, multiversal worlds colliding type of stuff, sometimes items from others worlds like a minecraft diamond sword or enderpearl ends up in the players hands or a modern handgun, etc from all the previous failed adventurers)  1 Magic Academy Campaign (Players are learning basic fundamental spells such as low level abjuration and taming creatures, horticulture, alchemistry, and divinity/ history class, and such while surviving in a corrupt city)
It just came back to watch this vid but this first thing I hear is seducing someone lol 😂 0:27
I love how Alpharad's character is just Larry and Jaiden's character is just Toothless.
Love all the Wind Waker music throughout 💚
Am i the only one that thought alpharad was Bryson?
Alpharad is basically Larry from Scarlet and Violet lol
All of the turtle names :D
1:14 that’s gonna be a like from me my friend
Oh gosh please do more of these it was awesome!
This is my new favorite video😭
Flashbacks to when Paul unknowingly was throwing his child
Once I saw the sheep, I knew what this was. I can’t wait for the hijinks  So it wasn’t exactly the one shot I thought but still great hijinks 😂 miss the furniture dragon though xD
I created a rangers beast master (based off Arthur Morgan) I chose speak Goblin as one of my profincies and my whole party (DM included) asked why I figured it would come in handy at some point. It did. We were able to infiltrate a Goblin village. The village used to be known for making apple pies the Goblins can't read the recipe so in exchange for safe passage I translated the recipe to Goblin for the king. Now whenever we need them a whole town of Goblins will come help us. I also have a Goblin who lives in my bag of holding he hates all of us, but since no one else can understand him i make it seem like he loves us 😂😂😂😂😂
I want to play dnd but no idea how nor have friends who play it this will/may be weird but could i get a inv some time
adorable
You should watch Dimension 20! Got me into and hooked on DnD😂
I'm currently unwell and feverish and hearing Jaiden say that AlphaRad and Ranboo were looking for me required a wisdom saving throw
Is that the Beast? 4:15
Please do Yu-Gi-Oh next
This was so fun to work on!! I originally intended to slip in a Taako from Adventure Zone: Balance, but i ended up forgetting 🥲 Glad some of Vox Machina got in tho!
yo
THE Plot Twist of all time. Mark Thompson.
The worm screams "It's wormin' time," then worms all over the place.
JAIDEN YOU FINALLY DID IT THIS WAS THE BEST MOST UNHINGED AWSOME THING I HAVE EVER SEEN OMG!!! ❤❤❤🤩🤩🤩 YOUR EVEN NUMBER 3 ON TRENDING I LOVE YOUUUUU!
15:00 TOP 10 Anime Betrayals that was SO good! >XD  This is why DND is a very game especially with friends. ^^
We played something similar in boy scouts, we called it makeshift D&D. Reason being was because we had no rules to what you could do and only 1 20 sided die that my friend brought. One campaign that I really liked was when we had an all out brawl just for the fun of it. I was some sort of buff guy named Darrel, my friend was a wizard yoshi that loved to eat grass, another friend was an avocado with god-like powers, my brother was kermit the dog, kermit the frog with a dog body, and my other friend was an imposter from among us. We all started hanging out and whatnot, then I accidently destroyed some of wizard yoshis grass and fighting began, I don't remember all the details of the fight but what I do remember was that wizard yoshi turned the entire world into the state of New Mexico and I was was about to snap wizard yoshis neck. At the last second, he pulled out an uno reverse card and I snapped my own neck. After the conundrum, I was exiled to another planet. Never to be seen again.
Gobbagob: the risk i took was calculated, but man am i bad with math
This was great, i would love to see more
WELCOME TO D&D !!!!!!
Omg was that the horse from adventure time that the goblins were cooking!?
God, poor Mark. He got dealt the worst hands imaginable. Pour one out for Mark, folks.
Sees Vox Machina in the video “Inside screaming intensifies”
I HATE when my ax gets peeled.
At 11:20 Oh my god they can’t see the invisible force
damn its just regular show
what happened to ranboo being stuck in a timeloop?
Did someone create Larry for DnD lol. I love it
Love the CR cameo 😂
THIS WAS THE GREATEST THING I'VE WATCHED IN A WHILE!!! It sounded like you guys had an absolutely fantastic time playing and using your imagination!! :D That twist at the end was something I genuinely did not even see and laughed out loud!! I hope you do more of these in the future!!
Awesomeness 🤍!!!! This is one thing I love about dnd. The stories.
Ranboo is bongo cat
IM IN TEARS OMFGGG - I shouldve been expecting that acid breath but IM WEEPING
This was both awesome and the most accurate depiction of a DnD game I've ever seen.
I wish YouTube added a feature so I looks like the video 10,000 times over.
we need more dnd
Im enjoy seeing/hearing sudden Adventure time refrences
Thank you for this, I’m making a one shot and idk what I’m gonna do, but I’m stealing some of these ideas 🥲
WE NEED MORE DND VIDEOSSS
I can just imagine Charlie speaking in the NPC’s voices while you were playing the campaign! Also, it would have been really cool if jaiden’s character had an ari bird.
what are their classes and stuff? (it would be just horrible if this comment was pinned)
I LOVE THIS
Poor Mark... Gets hit with depression, his wife comes back, but it's not his wife! It's a dragon that blasts his face with Acid! And many other problems! But damn man... poor Mark :c
when Mark turned back to reality i heard the theme song and it's one of the songs of the final bosses of kirby
This type of story, when things... happens... don't try to reason things, just... go with the flow...
Dnd is a bored game without the board and without the game
Paul is just Larry from scarlet and violet
Lucas before playing looks hamination and playing lucas look like draco malfoy
Yo some of the scenes are really fluint good job!
You guys should continue this
I love that jacob is lary😂
Jaiden, what happened to turtle?
BLASTS HIM IN THE FACE
Why does Paul look like Larry
4:11 Gravity Falls Reference
JAIDEN THANK YOU FOR USING MASKED DEDEDES THEME FROM KIRBY TRIPLE DELUXE IM GONNA WEEP
IS THAT RANBOOOOO!!!!
i would like to say what happened in my adventer but i don't think it is legal
Oh god, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would, I wish for more in the future.
Something about alpharads character reminds me of Larry from scarlet and violet…
This was great
That was awesome. Again I’ve got this strong feeling that I want play dnd with my friends. It’s a pity that none of them are into this stuff.
The best part was when the worm said, It's wormin' time. And then wormed all over those guys. Chills, literal chills
In my school theres a D@d club
Wonder if the ice king is in there 9:54
IM JUST LIKE YOU WERE AAAHHH I NEED TO FIND A DND GROUP
what is the music for the last scene/ credits? i've been looking for it everywhere
Lol, this is definitely one of the funniest Jaiden videos I’ve seen. It’s up there with the Digimon video for me. I also loved a lot of the little Easter eggs in this, from the Vox Machina crew at the pub to a couple Over the Garden Wall secrets I spotted here and there.
Middle-aged Larryeqsue Alpharad was not what I expected but I loved this entire thing lmao.
this was amazing!!! would love to see more :D
I remember playing a round with my friends. We were walking by a forest when a young woman ran out of the forest screaming “HELP!” and came up to us. My character; being incredibly suspicious and untrustworthy, tries to cut her head off with my sword. Not only do I roll and 2 for accuracy and completely miss, but I spin around in a circle until I fall completely on my face.  My friend; who is playing an 8 ft tall Dragonborn, then proceeds to slap my character SO HARD that I almost die on the spot. With the 1 piece of health I have left, I decide to behave for the rest of that play-through.  Moral of the story, don’t piss off an honourable 8 ft tall Dragonborn by trying to take the head off a random stranger who asks for help.  Next time I won’t miss.
Man this was so different from what I imagined but it's way more funny 😂😂😂😂 they really turned him into a worm and put him in a jar 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So Paul so long gay bowsered the sheep
Not sure why, but this vid is just permanently on my YT home page... welp, fourth times the charm I guess....
Wow this was soo cool please do more! Felt Like dreaming into fantasy
15:28 made me cry XD
Sounds like a fun session with a lot of well placed nat 1's. Glad you enjoyed your first game of dnd.
I LOVE THE SUB BUTTON SHILL HAHA
AHHHH THE VOX MACHINA CAMEOS!!
I really liked this video and the character design is incredible! Don't be mad but Charlie-Slimecicle's character look more dangerous than the real deal 😅 But still Awesome Video Jaiden! Maybe you could try animating an adventure you had on the QSMP next? It's just a suggestion
Did anyone else cry when she turned into marks ex and said "it's ok"?
RPG IS INCREDIBLE!!
That dragonborn with Jaden's hair was everything!
did I see a couple of over the garden wall references in here 👀
That was awesome
vox machina in a jaiden animations edit??!?!!! So cool!!
I just wonder, how did Paul take seven stabs to the leg
A DND game mastered by Charlie just sound like sheer fkin chaos, I want to see that so bad
Omg Charlie is so cool!
I started screaming the second I saw Ranboo on the thumbnail
OH I REMEMBER SEEING A CLIP OF THE TRANSFORMATION SCENE LMAO
I see you guys rolled a lot of ones.
*Jaiden:* Zoot immediately pitches the turtle at the door.  *No turtles were actually harmed in the making of this D&D campaign. Paul Jr. was compensated fairly for their contribution to this bit.*
9:51 OH MY GOSH ITS THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME 😭
This was awesome!!! A businessman from the Wall of Mart character was fantastic
not gonna lie i really wanna see more of this campaign, its amazing!
Jaidens gonna end up a forever dm isn’t she
*sigh* Attention and good publicity is NOT what D&D nor WotC needs right now. They have been actively shitting on the player base and content makers and do not deserve this kind of praise that will only serve to draw more people to the game and to WotC, which is Exactly what they hope will happen.. ignoring all the bullshit they have done thus far.
ITS WORMIN’ TIME!!!!!
This was great
OH MY GODS   I love the Vox Machina/Critical Role cameo
Jayden: asking to sub Me: already have and others should Others: nah (maybe idk)
😭 why did I already saw this and not at the same time help
4:34 That turtle could’ve given you guys a place to live just sayin
This is absolutely AWESOME!! Would love more of these omg 💙
I love the critical role cameo. grog is best girl 😂
Wait Paul Jr. the Turtle = Paul Jr. the Human?
That was very fun, I wouldn’t complain if there was more in the future ;)
I would love to hear a live-play one-shot of y'all 😂
I love that Paul is just a fusion of Larry and alpharad for some reason
love the pokemon ranger dim sun hideout music
Yeahhh jaiden and Jacob would absolutely prefer shenanigans over combat
yayy jaiden posted
This is a fever dream
Barely over a minute in and already a Critical Role reference. This is perfection.
16:03 this is why I love Ranboo’s storytelling, the way the mood shifts is amazing. Been a fan of their storytelling since late 2021 to early 2022, I’m not planning on stopping now.
This... is a thing of beauty!
Bean but d&d
Sometimes there’s a board. Also how are these guys getting good initiative rolls
This couldn’t have come at a better time for me! I just finished season 1 of Vox Machina, along with watching/listening to the original campaign and I just finished my very first character sheet last night. So as you can see I’m in a D&D mood. Also I really enjoyed the Vex, Keleth, Pike and Grog cameo, and seeing them in this animation style
Wild sheep chase? Nice
9:10  So Good
OMG ALL THE WIND WAKER MUSIC
So, Jacob’s D&D character is essentially Larry?  It’s pretty much the antithesis of Alpharad, and I don’t know if it’s incredible, or incredibly cursed.  Also, seeing the failures mostly only happen to Jacob is funny as hell
I loved this video! It'd be cool to see something like this again sometime
The acid blast to the face had me dying.  😂
I'm not kidding yesterday when i was gonna play dnd for the first time I got the notification for this video. Also the people I was playing with kept throwing me into skeletons so I was taking all the damage 😭
Ranboo was a Furryyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Paul is my favourite character, he's so done but also gets shit DONE. I love me a tired man
Ahh I love this!!!
"IT'S WORMIN' TIME!"
WE NEED MORE OF THIS
I never really cared for DND until after This video!!! wtf!!! sounds FUN AS FUCK
As a dnd player the game is pure chaos
BRO JACOB IS JUST LARRY FROM POKEMON. HE IS SO DEPRESSED AT THIS POINT AND IT IS SO.. SO FUNNY.
#3 on trending, nice
you should make a D&D series
Please do this again!
Please do more of this! I loved everything - the story, the animation, the Pokémon battle music, everything!
Why are the goblins cooking the creepy adventure time horse😭
NOT THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE😭
Ayy I remember watching the vod awhile ago
This was so much fun! I hope you play more D&D and share more videos of your adventures
Ive never played this but i guess ill try it after this video
I haven't watched the video yet but this will very likely get me into a D&D
Anyone else notice the horse cooking over the fire is identical to that one horse from adventure time?
Love it!
I literally need a dragon jaiden plush rn
17:29 WHAT IS THIS SONG ITS SO GOOD
I MUST see more
I like how Jacob is based off of Larry from Pokémon S/V in this video
I’m here at 1.4 million views, 212k likes, number 3 on trending and uploaded 19 hours ago, and it’s crazy how now you have FINALLY uploaded again! Which is GOOD, ahem, which is uh, which is obviously good heh.  Edit: now it’s at 1.6m and 24 hours ago, and at 234k likes. Almost a day old.
The new “dream” update seems amazing, pretty cool they added detailed memory, alongside multiplayer dreams.
This was the silliest most interesting dnd session I have ever watched
If you ever play dnd again, please make another video on it!! This was so fun
I love how jacob is larry the gym leader
:O yippe d&d Upload
IS PAUL JUST LARRY FROM POKEMON???😭😭😭
In some of the fanart when you had wings you looked like hawks in a way I’m not trying to be mean bye the way
I have a reason why I unsubscribe from here and it’s not the video it’s just what Jaden is saying about god and Jaden try to roast me I’ve been through worse you look like a rice eater
Ranboo went from clorton (JRWI) To CatBoy
My d&d experience was I was a elf sorceror called Selfield (seff-eeld) and me and my buds were sleeping in a hobbit hole when a gnome knocked the door, my friend Samuel took out his spear open the door and stabbed the air thinking someone would have gotten stabbed but the gnome look up at the spear and said "well its nice to meet you too!" 😂 and he told us there is a dragon and he needs us to defeat it so he gave us a horse and a carriage and of we went with only beans on toast as food (well I was the only one who got beans on TOAST because I was the only one who has Flaming Hands) then we stopped at a forest and some of the gang went to investigate the strange noise at the shadows- and this is where we're left off so yeah pretty exciting but not as exciting as yours jaiden! ❤
I loved this to bits, but more trolling with cursed items, please
Currently making my own dnd world inspired by both Norse and Celtic mythology. :)
So Paul… is Larry from Pokémon
My first time playing D&D, our DM quit on us, (I was a wizard) he did this because we needed to get into a stable and I wanted to burn down the door with a campfire instead of going and knocking out the gaurd that was five meters away 😂
alpharad as larry lmao
That was such an intense character introduction jeez XD
I could almost see all of the rolls you guys made.
GROOOOOOG
I love how Jacob’s character is just Larry from Pokémon
that sounds so dumb and fantastic and just gave me a BUNCH of ideas for my next game, thank you
Engagement for the algorithm!
This was so cool, I'd love to see highlights from the game!
hey love the video but if you do it again (which I hope you do) I think it would be better if the music was quitter just so it's not distracting
THATS SO FUNNY 😂😂😂 I loved this
Jaiden animation I Broke my friends heart what should I do😭
I love dragonborn jaiden
don't think we forgot
YES!! new video❤
I realy want to play d and d
Is dnd this confusing?
That was an absolutely ridiculous session...which is the best kind.
D&D is one me of my favorite games
I loved this video, i liked it when you were an animated and not a V tuber, drop the anime drawing of you when you stream and it would be so much better, if you want to be a streamer at least commit to it, or if you want to do both, you need to drop the drawing of you when you stream, I'm not forcing you, but it saddens me when I see your streams, I miss the old Jaiden
SO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
The ending was too nice, we need more depression grr (great vid)
Omggg the legend of vox machina reference!!!
THAT WAS SO COOL! I loved this so much. now I gotta bully my friends into hurrying up and getting their characters ready.
So injustices this willingness be nice
This is so cool ,can you do this again?
i tried it 3 times i think im cursed more ways that one now cuz every time the party broke up after session zero all 3 times as in someone just stopped or got mad and said i quit
Okay so I got the classes pretty much figured out here, the Tabaxi is a bard (maybe multiclass rouge), the guy in the suit is a barbarian (initially thought he would be a warlock), but Jaiden? No idea. What's her class?  Edit: Is she a wild magic sorcerer by chance?
i love how poul is jojo reference
I love the vox machina reference
It was so good i was emotional at the end.
Ehhh vox machina cameo
Hey Jaiden! Just wanted to say I love your videos. You made my childhood.
I love the vox machina reference at the start of the video
ok but why does Paul look like Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet
How did you not create an aarakocra?
a furry hi five  /\/\/\/\ O O O O|
Mark did nothing wrong 👏👏
Definitely how dnd plays. Always some hilarious player chaos that the dm just incorporates because it is funny or makes a character's story complete.
So Paul is a barbarian and the cat is a bard but what is jaidens character class?
ADVENTURE TIME EASTER EGG 10:23
alpharad being larry from pokemon is way too expected
I gotta say i was very exited to see Keyleth, Vex'halia, Pike and Grog in the first shot xD
Real live stream of this now but the chat are the dungeon masters
we where fighting a ghost, our barbarian that unlucky basterd who has the will Wetton curse roled 2 nats ones in a row, one ages him 1d4 times ten yest and got aged 40, second time he got possessed and controlled by the ghost.  He was  raging at the time, he killed my fellow rouge and i manage to knock him out, but then i got controled by missing the roll by 1 so campaign over
This was so funny i cannot
Absolutely beautiful. The Ex Wift BLAST was just... amazing in a way hard to put to words xD
I love *Sweepster23* ....
Jaiden has joined the commune.
"Let's see Paul Allen's card."
PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE!
its susie from deltarune
I LOVE IT PLEASE DO MORE
What a crazy D&D adventure.
Please more <3
using "depression" as the command word is just so evil lol🤣🤣
Please do this again plz!! btw great job keep it up!
Me literally yesterday: I want to play D&D...
What about the turtles
mindblown for luap
Jacob’s character is literally larry but not a normal type gym leader and elite 4 member and not with blackhair and perfect
i just played a d&d halloween one shot last night it was fun
What is Polish mixture between Kira from JoJos bizarre’s adventures, and the new normal Pokémon Kim leader
I saw the steam of this but wasnt able to watch the end so Im glad I got the ending I hope you have more fun D&D expiriences
this was awesome. i hope to get into DnD one day. maybe ill bug my friends into letting me join in on their campain.
Algorithm 🐈
I love the part where the worm said "its wormin time" and then wormed all over the place
Good!!!
This is so amazing and I love it!!
HOW DO YOU FIND PEOPLE THAT CAN DEAL WITH A COMPLETE LACK OF KNOWELEDGE ON YOUR PART TO PLAY DND HOW????? I can manage fine with dnd beyond cuz it does everything for you but then people want to use pencil and paper and I’m just like wtf????
Please make another video of this
This was so good
Thanks
THIS IS AMAZING
If you did record the play through PLEASE POST IT
Is it me or does Paul look a lot like a Larry
JACOB BECAME LARRY
Loved this, keep up the amazing work. Jaiden Animations vs literally every other youtuber. score: Jaiden 999, Others 0.
That acid spit in the end, sent me crying lol
only just started watching but i cant get over how much i LOVE the axe in the briefcase :)
You know, Mark Thomson wrote "Modern Particle Physics". I think the DM is a physics student
Sounds like a normal session.
I set a tavern on fire while drunk in the game and killed my party…. Fun times!
I've never done a Dungeons and Dragons game either, but I'd love to try one.
my favorite part was when the clay worm said 'it's worming time' and proceeded to worm all over jaiden.  seriously though, this was hilarious through and through. i'd be down for more!
The only memorable thing I’ve said in a dnd game was when we were surrounded by a bunch of bug bears. I was looking around for a weapon but only found a stick so out of panic I blurted out “I’m about to shove this where the sun don’t shine” I produced to die the next turn due to a crit
The acid blast part made me laugh so hard I almost died from it. Like legit, that just caught me off guard
the slimer is gooped
As soon as the sheep said it was human i knew it was paul jr, and as soon as the name "luap" came out, i was sure.
it was funny and great and Jaiden is so awesome (not copied ad pasted I just type fast lol)
YEESSSSSSSS
What about the time loop
I srem the people and I knew I had to watch
unsub
Anyone know the songs in the background specifically the one during Marks fight that starts at 12:27
This is amazing and I'd legitimately watch a whole series about this crew. At the very least I'd love to see more D&D videos!
Now to Play Pokemon Tabletop United!
YESSSSS
So fun to see such unhinged play from start to finish xD
"The Wild Sheep Chase" adventure?
you just went fully on pastel flurry on mark with that one 😂
As someone who’s trying to get into dnd. This just helps my case to start playing.
I LOVE THE VOX MACHINA REFRENCE THE SHOW WAS SOOOOOO GOOD
THIS WAS SO SILLY I LOVE IT! I only played my first campaign the other day and it's REALLY FUN :DD
9:12 The emoji meme
Do more D&D
I have a couple of notes on this video 1. Paul:  strengths:smart,weapons,speed  Weaknesses:depression, Zoot: Strenghs:spells,power,animal speaking,voice powers, Weaknesses:stupidity, Thalumule: Strenghs:shock waves,healing powers,music powers,tools,speed Weaknesses:mind control,power 2.alpharad really just went i want to be larry from pokemon scarlet and violet 3. So let me get this straight paul fed his son clay forcefully and through his son twice at a magic wand
Jaden I think at the start of next year you should start another subathon I really enjoyed it and would really want to see you do it again I watched as much of it as I could at all times
That was so cool, I love how she just acid blasts mark in the face XD
Delightful
vox machina in the tavern <3
This was quite fun  The end art shows you with wings and you did not play as that character but a dragon person?
YOO 1 OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS PLAYING MY FAVORITE GAME!!!
I really wish I could've seen the original stream because this looked like such a fun thing to watch happen
wait wait wait wait wait I'm hearing Charlie&Ranboo? This feel like the latest Spiderman movie frankly when all the timeline confined into one major event😮
Loved the Mario and Luigi superstar saga music in the background 😂
wait ur a dragonborn? thats so cool! i love playing as a dragonborn! and ranboo is a bard? bards r so cool!!!!!
And this is why I want to play dnd, too bad I have no social life
Wasn't expecting to see the Adventure Time poo-brained horse
THE DRAGON ARTSTYLE IS SO AMAZING AND DELICIOUS AND WHATTT! You and the team did so well on this video’s animation! I really love all of the funny moments and how motion is animation and all of the backgrounds looking perfect with the descriptions given! This might be my new favorite video that you guys have produced :3
11/10 this is peak D&D!
damn, she really hit him with the emotional damage
Welcome to the club jaiden im always a dungeon master you need to do a whole chanel where you share your d and d stories
I can't believe Alpharad is just straight up Larry
pls make this a series!! love it so much
The ending bruh
Paul reminds me of Larry from Pokémon
The ending dude bruh
1:15 VOX MACHINA REFERENCE WOOOOOOOO!!!
As soon as you said a sheep jumps through the window I was like "oh my god it's that one shot" a random one off reddit that I dmed and had someone pipe up and say "sorry I have played this before," that later I had to pipe up during a different game that I suddenly recognised that goddamn sheep.   I've ended up meeting that sheep at 4 tables now and it is becoming a running gag in my own head that if a oneshot starts in a tavern I'm just waiting for the sheep
Welcome to the cult 😆
Thanks
If you do make another video about D&D, it would be nice if you got your friends to voice their characters or if the session was recorded. Good ol' fun Ms animations.
I like all the "Over the Garden wall" and "Adventure Time" references 🤣
"Nobody knows what the hell is going on"  Yup. Sums up pretty much all session 1s everywhere
I absolutely loved this one shot!!
The good old days of animation
Should have gone with Jason Fundeburker. There's always next time when you pick up a frog!
I bet this meant a lot to the players and the DM. It is every DMs dream to have their players enjoy a game as much as you guys did and love it so much you make art of it. So cool! Also love the CR shoutout.
WAIT IT THIS A GONNA BE A SERIESS???WHATTTT?!?!?!?!!
Alpharad playing straight out Larry is hilarious
The adventure time refrence the horse
AHHH THIS IS SO GOOD
Yoooo if you like that you should really try rom hacks in pokemon
That was a genuinely good story tbh
I love the pacing and the characters.
I love how Jacob is basically Larry from Pokemon S/V
...One....   ....Of.....   !!..US..!!
reminds me of my first time playing dnd, long story short i ended up burning an island.
Spoiler for the end of the video, so finish it first if you haven’t, but having Luap being Paul backwards, in tandem with the hilarious visuals explaining it, was the best part of the video imo. Please make more
I wanna see more
So we’ve got depressed middle age man, bongo cat, and Susie from Deltarune. This is gonna be a fun watch.
id love to see the full playthrough :D
"Command Spell: Depression" is the one spell I never knew I needed 😂
D&D is in stranger things
NOW I WANNA PLAY DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS AND ALSO THIS VID IS AWSOM

Jaiden: guys I know what to do to get past the puzzle. Eat the clay.
Cellbit dont chose her to Ordem Paranormal,so she run to plan B rsrsrsrsrsrsrs
15:32 I love that you actually used their laughter from the livestream of the campaign. This was an incredible video to watch Jaiden. Quality One Shot, thoroughly enjoyed, well done to the whole party!
MOAR!!!!!!
Play piggy
I have clearly, and obviously, been gaming with the wrong people. 😆
Hello Jaiden Animations
that ending got me- 🥲
This was actually a really good story for a one shot!
Dude this video was so good!! The amount of times I’ve WISHED I was good at drawing and animation to recreate dnd sessions!!  This was so hilarious and honestly chaos is the best in dnd it makes it so much fun!
that sounds like a classic dnd session
That was amazing actually lol, I’ve always wanted to play d&d so I’ll see if there’s a group running near me now
Awesome 😍 that point blank acid on the face really hits hard haha
This was insane 😂
That just Larry lol 1:43
Kirby Air Ride music! I miss that game.
More d&d and Pokemon please i love it
WOOOOO
I need clarification; what's the class for each player? Alpha wears a suit, but wields an axe- that's confusing for me
I saw potential foreshadow. There for there future adventures are inevitable. Please make more
and now we need jaiden in Ordem
I love D&D
i'd watch this movie
What a D&D Session, I love it and want see more.
D&D and Jaiden Animationss are a match made in heaven
i wouldve loved to have seen all this session in real time
In 1:16 I see what you done did there 😂 fykyk

THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST VIDEOS EVER!
I love these videos
I'm impressed to see how no one complains about the dragon born having a tail. Jaiden, you have a really mature fandom🧐
The Vox Machina reference was amazing
This is incredible!!!
paul reminds me of larry from pokemon scarlet/violet. am i the only one who see that?
My fave Creators playing dnd?????
The vox machina reference 😂❤
What a great one shot!!!
I look forward to those highlights, or even just the whole session.  I am most interested in the reactions to each other's characters because this party is wild.
9:50 nice adventure time reference
Legend of Vox Machina!!!
plsplpslpslsplspsps i BEG you make another one of these
This was just so funny Please tell me there's gonna be more
Love it <3

Unhinged and unstable. I WANT MORE 🤣🤣
Yaaaaaay finally another video :D
I'm stealing that clay puzzle
Just had my first dnd session last night! What timing Also try Just Roll With It!
I love how Alpharad is just playing Larry.
Hahaha, this is so much fun xD
Dope ass campaign, filled classic DND shenanigans Awesome video Jaiden. Always love the content you put out. Also GOD DAMN the acid blast at point blank 😂😂😂😅😅.
This was great. Glad you had fun on playing D&D. I wouldn't mind seeing more videos like this; even if it they're games other than D&D.
Loved paul, it just felt like paul was jacob+larry lol
1:15 hey thats VoxMachina,the critical role crew would be flattered
I love stuff like this!!!
This is so strange I’ve just started my first d and d campaign AND ITS ALMOST THE EXACT SAME at least the whole sheep thing danggggg
And that's how you DnD!
How the heck did I get jump scared by a jaidenanimations video
I liked the animated vox machina its so funny!
I enjoyed the video! Thanks 🎉
I look forward to the end card of the next video, all full of Jaidens dragonborn character.
I love the Vox Machina reference at 1:12 lol
Uh. Ima be honest. This story was kinda cringe
I've played D&D before but this video was so wild and hilarious I'm intrigued
yes dnd!
The Luap reveal killed me
The best collab honestly love all of your content
This was a fantastic video! If you do play more D&D, it would be great to see you make a little series? 🥹🧡
WILD SHEEP CHASE!  Such a great one shot. This is great.
so if i can Imagine "A GIANT POOP TURN WITH BIRD ARMS AND MINIGUNS AS LEGS WITH A LITTLE DUCK ON ITS HEAD" it can happen in game???????????
This was amazing. Im crying
Yep this is definitely ur first dnd session, i choose dragonborn, u fought the first thing that caused problems, and kept a turtle named paul jr
paul is giving me serious larry from pokemon vibes
i am very detail oriented... i liked that very much
So did. sum guy got approach you in August
THAT WAS SUCH AN AMAZING CAMPAIGN
That looked so fun!
Welcom to the dnd world!
I hope this was recorded as a VOD or something like that so we can see what the full session was like
next time you play can you add dough dough i feel like it wil be awsome for you guys to meet
What do you think about Russians?
Point blank acid blast 😂😂😂
I think this is one of the best videos I've ever seen❤
Hail yeah! Love dnd!
Alpharad's opening monologue sounded like Kira Yoshikage (from JoJo) copypasta but more... sad
Pal seriously sound and looks like lary from Pokémon scarlet and violet. Like if you agree.
DND YOOOOOOO I love this sort of stuff
I love paul
We all now that 17 minutes of video is about 4-5 hours of play or more
Did nobody see the Vox machina reference?
The legend of Vox Machina reference!!!
I was crying from the end I’m glad Paul had a happy ending after getting carped on
Pure Love.
Jainden picked Dragonborn   Based
The thumbnail reminds me of super Mario bros wonder
i lovd D&D
Jaiden likes D and D so much that they made a movie about it
Now... How to get her and DingoDoodles to collab...
This was so awesome! I’m a huge fan of D&D and it was so cool to see one of my favorite creators playing it!!
OMG! This was actually my first adventure as well! My bf loves D&D and I played a bard, because why make things easy for myself? Love to see you enjoying D&D!
did i noticed a Vox Machina reference at 1.15m ???
Ok, I'm a dm for a group of legit crazy people, this video reminds me of them. The barbarian killed a horse carriage guy because he had seahorses.
I've also started playing DnD this year, and it's much more fun than I ever imagined! Before starting our current campaign, my friends and I just silently agreed that we had to make characters which were extremely competent at something but simultaneously seem like weirdos at first glance. So here's our party:  -A two-meter-tall dragonborn barbarian who's noticeably dumb and is always accompanied by a bird, who's apparently his son (No, he hasn't explained that part of his lore yet) -A human bloodhunter who literally has no emotions (the player somehow makes it work), almost always covered with a white cape and mask  -A tall tabaxi ranger which behaves like a typical calm, collected human, but randomly does cat stuff (he coffs up hair balls from time to time). Also, he has adopted a worg puppy. Doesn't even have a purpose for it, he just felt like it -A 4 ft tall ratfolk who's an expert on marksmanship, for some reason? Also he has 18 INT but around 6 WIS, so he's super smart but barely retains any knowledge -A human noble who hasn't finished writing his lore yet, but has managed to give out 3 epic speeches. He convinced a whole town to fight against a tribe of goblins with an improvised speech. But we keep teasing him because not even him knows his own past -A high elf wizard who dominates the magic of the stars and may attempt to predict the future by studying the night sky. Fun stuff is: he doesn't know wether each vision is true, partially true, or completely false, nor when and where it will take place. Also he has the lowest amount of HP in the party and a single well-placed shot can take him down -And my character: a dwarven rogue who was born on a thief-guild and barely speaks dwarf because she wasn't only taught by her mother. She also probably has ADHD, and she mostly doesn't care what's happening around her because she knows she wouldn't figure it out if she wanted to. I'm planning on slowly revealing her tragic past, but for now she's just the dwarven silly woman who steals only out of survival AND spite, and I'm all for it
what song is this at 15:40?
I need more. I NEED MORE!
Really nice animation i've loved it funny to see Vox machina 1:16 :D
Ok so bard, wizard? Maybe mage and a barbarian
That was so cool! Loved the episode <3
paul is kinda 🥰
This is funny because I just started playing d&d myself also I killed a Dragonborn and took its head as a trophy as a teifling paladin I also have a baby gem dragon as a pet named tiichi which is draconic for honour
0:38  New Achievement Unlocked :  'Shameless'
YOU GUYS GOTTA DO A SECOND SESSION YEEEE THIS WAS AMAZING
More more moreeeeee!!!!
I love the way you tell stories and the beyond wacky adventure
I got worried when Paul almost split the party
Oh my god Vox Machina reference!!!!!
This was an amazing video pls make more dnd videos
Why did this pop up in my dnd era
What do you mean a different type?  This was amazing!
yeyyyyy D&D
Dafuq?
i wanna play dnd now
I really want to be in this group. Sounds so much fun. Nice animation, i really enjoyed the video!
Just found your channel. The mario and luigi fight themes were an amazing touch!!!
hey jaiden when will you know, heard and volunteered for MCC  known for their battle with creators from smp's and more the 2 teams will go all out on dodgebolt  my fav was mcc17 orange ocelot winning comeback
kinda want more of this
THAT WAS RLLY ENTERTAINING
Paul naming his son Paul
I really enjoyed this different content
AAAA THIS IS SO COOL! I love the way each part was animated!
Paul is a barbarian, Tholomew is a bard, but wth is Zoot? A cleric? Wizard? Another Bard?
waited so long and loved it :DDDD
i love the larry reference
THIS IS SOOOOOO GOOD ITS SO FUN YOU CAN SEE EVERY CRIT ROLL
The fact that this all makes so much sense, with Luap probably turning into a sheep because of the riddle door, why Paul is so sad, etc.
Shout out to Paul’s design being a reference to Nanami from jjk
Now all we need is dingo doodles and Felix
That sound like a epic DnD session
Is there a video of the actual session anywhere? I feel like it'd be hilarious
This one-shot feels like an acid trip
The goblins’ names have to inspired by adventure time
I remember when I entered a dnd group with some friends and stuff, we never managed to play, now my character is waiting to be used, alone in one of the papers of my notebook
Why is aphlarad look like Larry from Pokémon Scarlett
Fun fact the branch that was turning to gold emerald ruby and silver signifys pokemon gold and silver,ruby and emerald
If 1 is the worst game ever en 10 the best, i give 11
I-… Is Alpharad ok?
THIS IS SO COOL!! This campaign sounds so funnnn, glad you enjoyed your first time playing!
adventure time horse 🤧
4:33 JOJO REFERENCE?!?!?!
Ores I
I F-CKING LOOOOOOOOVE DND?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yup I love this video thanks Jaiden!
Hell yea
bongocat, i see
do a geometry dash video
It’s so ironic, Jaiden and I both chose dragon born characters as our first characters ever played in DND😂😂 I was even able to draw mine at the time which made it even more fun and engaging :3 I loved this video so much 🥹
I beg you, on my knees, please do more dnd videos. I adore this. This is both holy and sacred art. This is why the internet was created. It all peaks here.
And then he plummets leading to his demise: nat 1 huh?
EARLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pretty epic
Haha yes, dragon Jaiden
insane video and super fun to watch as always 😂
This is the new @jaidenanimations nuzlocke story video!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
HOLY HUH U MADE A  CROSSOVER WITH RANBOO AND SLIMECICLE?
That part when you just blast Mark with acid 😂😂
So once while I was playing uhhhh I slashed off an ogers balls and persuaded him to join our group........
Wait so what class were you? The others were obv barb and bard but I can't tell what class you are. A rogue?
It’s worming time
Paul the goat!
I like how Alpharad is just Larry from the new Pokemon games.
ur a lizard?
What are your guys’s characters? Mine is a Dragonborn Druid (Spores Circle)
I loved the time when the clay worm said “it’s wormin time” and clayed all over the room
Jacob just wants his chat to love him more than Larry🤣
DEPRESSION!
this was straight up goofy, swag, and even money. Jolly good show!
15:30 😂😂😂😂 what the hell jaiden that was genius! That's how you kill a evil manager! What the hell! And aswell who are your dungeons and dragons characters? Anyways bbbbbbbbbbbbyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeee😊😊😊😊🐉
im literally paul
love this video!
ONE OF US, ONE OF US
This video was worth the wait
Jaiden really nailed it it's good
I LOVE PENGUINS
0:57 to sum up the charicters by look, lazy dragon, larry from pokemon ans pusses distant scootish cuzen (it looks like bag pipes on there back)
That was amazing! More D&D stories!
i wish i had friends to play dungeons and dragons with
crazy how people watch satanists
The fact ranboo was the shortest
I didn't know salary man was an option for a character!!! that was hilarious 😂😂😂
Paul is literally Larry from pokemon
I don't get this game 😕 😐
I can’t believe Jacob became Larry
More please? Same charcters???
This is awesome
4:15 THE BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAST!
Here I am thinking Alpharad was Haminations in the thumbnail
The amount of chaos that ensued is unhinged  I LOVE IT
I would have never expected to see Larry Jacob and I am pleasantly surprised
Ngl, I’d stay a zebra
As a Jaiden fan and as someone who also hadnt tried out dnd for unecessarily long- (Tho I've been playing for the last 2-3 months) this was an absolute blast, I'd love to watch the VOD as well I've only seen clips- oh wait actually I just searched it and found the vod.. nice...
I love Paul 💛 I don't know why, but his lack of charisma and total "why am I here?" face was hilarious
Larry
Oh man I wonder what that dragon in the sky at the end means, I’d bet a pretty penny that it’s got to do with jaiden’s backstory because we never hear it. I do hope she makes more because if she does she’ll not only have the animator community on her side but she’ll have the end community watching her videos which would be A LOT of views and fans.
Making luap turn out to be paul was actually unhinged story telling 😂
No one going to mention that Paul was Larry from Pokemon?
My dads name is Mark Thomson. I don’t think these characters would like him very much 💀💀
THAT WAS EPIC!!! I really liked this, it was so much fun!!! :))
Really nice. Was that Wild Sheep Chase youguys played?
The Critical Role cameo!
I love how I already knew the acid blast clip and was waiting for it to happen the entire time lmfao
gee.. NOW I *HAVE* TO PLAY DND
PLEASE MAKE A SEQUAL. I NEED MORE D&D
i love at 1:15 little easter egg of Vox Machina there for Critical Role appreciation
this is so awesome!!!!! ❤❤❤
Paul looks like lary
This video was FANTASTIC!!! My favorite of your videos yet :)
is that blonde Larry from pokemon 😆
Wait. WAIT. WAIT A DARN SECOND. so THIS is the campaign. this is the campaign with the Acid Blast. oh my FREAKING WORD.
1:39 My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
The "Mark's ex wife" part got me on floor xd
CHARLIE'S ALIVE???
I love how he is just straight up Larry, done with "life"
Paul is actually Larry
i kinda want paul ngl
All I could think during the hug was "Now acid breath his face off please." I was so excited when that actually happened shortly after.
Are we sure the party are the good guys? Animal abuse and they ruined a guys life and then have him depression??? Lol
Paul greatest DnD character 😂
I would so want this to be a series, I BEG
Jaiden found the goldmine of YouTube content.  No more life stories to tell? Just make one ^^
Honey wake up. Jaiden finally posted an animation. Great work btw. Love it.
I saw that vox machina easter egg :D
This was amazing
Alpharad as Larry from SV was priceless 😂
Alphard looka like Draco Malfoy
my god this was a bad trip! Ur gonna make me a f*cking, broke ass stoner jaiden! I'm already addicted to this kind of brain-twisting chaos!
When 5he sheep appeared i immediately knew which oneshot this was gonna be
The fact that alpharad was just Larry from Pokemon was too funny
IT'S WORMIN' TIME the scream that left my body in that moment could shatter glass.
Is it just me or does alpharad looks like Larry from pokemon
Please, do more this was amazing
Is that the horse from adventure time??? If yes why are they eating ice king
I have not laughed this hard in such a long time.  Thank you thank you thank you.
I have never played D&D. I don't even know anyone who plays it. I first heard of it from TBBT. It looked kinda fun and I've always wanted to play :') But there's literally none for me to play it with because most people around me don't even know what that is...
THIS WAS AMAZIIIING! It was so cool seeing the characters animated like this, i hope we can see more in the future!
Turtle! Final answe- "-ITS A WORM"
Animal TF? Count me in!
Loved this video. please make another dnd video. i hope you and slimecickle can colab again to make part 2
The poor horse on the roast
This video is gonna blow up, make another.
THIS IS AMAZING PLS DO MORE
The acid spit was so predictable 😂😂😂
OMG THE VOX MACHINA EASTER EGG!!! I LOVE U FOR INCLUDING THEM IN THE BACKGROUND 😂❤
FINALLY IT HAPPENED YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS best video ever you are amazing
I have never played DnD I am so confused and so intrigued
This was great to see, to be able to take part in your adventure in D&D through amazing animation! I myself have many fond memories of starting to play D&D with friends from my exchange year this summer. We still have plans to continue playing online, even though most of us in the campain live in different countries <3
4:15 the beast from Over the Garden Wall lol
*"Hi jaiden i'm psychic and you will have three children, okay byeee!"*
No dragons?
For the door riddle, my first guest was a sobriety test ☠️
I literally died of laughter at paul’s uh- emotionless face when he said “the alphabet backwards” and got turned into a zebra 😭
Vox Machina cameo!!!
Omg that was wild hahahaha amazing video Jaiden!
Omg I loved the characters soo much. Btw Jaiden just blasting acid to the poor man that made me die 🤣
14:59 Super mario galaxy ost coming in to ruin your existence
okay, but animating a campaign is a brilliant idea?? like, this channel seems perfect for that sort of thing and also, a bringing player's story to life seems like a dream scenario
9:50 not the ice king horse lol
damn i love how alpharad looks like larry
noo u kille the ice king horse!!!!!
holy shit this is insane... SO GOOODD
That was epic as.
Is that man at the beginning freaking Larry from pokemon SV?
JaidenAnimations AND DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS? HELL YEAH
i am OBSSESSED with animated dnd stories, and this was amazing. Absolutely love Zoot's energy, thats the exact shit i pull in my games 😂
I been waiting for this!!!
I love seeing people's first DND games- also gotta appreciate the DM here that was amazing <3
Paul was definitely the best character
I love the reference 9:13
Amazing! Love this
never played D&D before so only thing i don’t get is that every playtrought/game is customized? that’s really cool
Ranboo being a cat .... just makes sense
That was epic 👍
The Vox Machina Reference! Nice!
As soon as Jaiden said they disguised themself as Mark's wife I remembered the infamous clip and knew where it was going xD
Paul throwing he’s son twice is hilarious to me.
Wow, Jaiden, get MORE of a nerd/pos
15:27 killed me.😂 I was like, "Since this is DnD this will go awry quickly."  And not even a minute later i was right😂
2/3 of my campaigns were cancelled, and the third one always gets delayed TwT
Nice i'm  a goblin.
Jaiden whits story thit you doe normel or oders
I need this to be a 100 part series xD
That was the most unhinged fantasy-adventure I've ever seen
When I saw the "disguise self" part. I realised that it was the most infamous moment in D&D history. The moment when Jaiden showed off her dark side, in the form of animation. It looked as good as I imagined it to be.
MORE PLEASE
Yes superstar saga and and masked dedede theme is the best and q one day can u do an jaiden animations of m and l superstar saga plz
The video was awesome!! Would love to see you play more D&D!! :D
Wouldn't it be kind of fun if when Jaiden cast the depression spell, Slimesickle just said ¨It worked but it had no effect¨.
THAT WAS EPIC
😅D&d is great
This a cool vid :)   I have nothing else to say.
HI
Pleaseeee someone help me, I remember the song at the end somewhere in the back of my mind and I just cant get the name!!
Jaiden can you play yokai watch
0:34 I have never been more compelled in my life to subscribe. You got another one Jaiden. 😉
I love the Vox machina cameo I hope you do that again if you do another campaign
[DEPRESSION]
Please please please play Pokemon X and Y please please please
Did, did I see vox machina? Or do I need another shot of tequila?
gave someone deppression
It would be funny to just add some random 8 year old into the mix.
14:54 i laughed way to hard there xD
I wanna see jaiden play "TF2" I-i don't know she'll play it or.. Not? There are no girls in that game, except the "Administrator", i dont wanna spoil much but.. You'll figure it out in the tutorial (this is the yes answer) If NO then i dont care. (i gotta show respect for womans). Alrighty then, "SEDUCE ME!" - Said by Spy
You need to star on Just roll With it!!! Ranbo did and it was super fun
Omg luaP
Is Jaiden joining the DnD YouTube animator arsenal?
cool vido
Best jaiden video ever
I hope you play more! Good job you emotional monster! (The stare on Jacobs face was great)
If I had a nickle for every poketuber who essentially made Larry their DnD Character, I'd have two nickles.  Which isn't alot but odd that it happened twice.....
this was so aweseome! Thank you for this video!
Music name pls :))
Look forward to the next one!🤩😍
The Vox machina shout out was also brilliant. They looked amazing!
Zoot used emotional torment
Me and my friends and I are doing DnD sessions too! My girl is a tiefling bard, and my best friend is a lizardfolk cleric addicted to coffee. I encourage her chaos by feeding her espresso beans randomly. I call her my lizard child despite being a grown adult. My best friend's husband is the DM and sits there and laughs at our antics while the Rouge of the group and I have ended up on the same wavelength of sensing when we shouldn't be in places... then there's Fred, our party's elven mage who insists on going into things head first. We got pulled into combat with 6 cursed skeletons that were waaaayyy more powerful than the party because he decided to go into a dark room instead of listening to the only person with dark vision (me) that it's not the best idea to do so. Thays when i found out, im lucky af with my rolls. Lol    I wish to see more of this content. It's beautiful and exciting.
"I have been living in a time loop" *JRWI flashbacks intensify*
Dam this looks Soo fun I gotta play DND one day
I will always remember Jaiden casting "depression".  It worked.  It REALLY worked!
how did i see the acid breath coming, that was amazing
Dragonborn in a blonde wig 😂
EEEEEYYYYYY SLIME THE DUNGEON MASTER THATS AMAZING
First second in and immediately recognizing Daisy Circuit from Mario Kart Wii!
i loved this video!!!
Kinda feel sorry for mark. Being his whole life was ruin by this cat person that plays bongos was crazy and says mark put a curse on him.
ranboo just be like *aggresssively plays music*
Awesome video
my sanity is this game
I saw vox machina in there, don't think you're sly  Great video Jaiden
I recognized the oneshot this was flavoured from the moment a sheep appeared. This was a fun dtory to witness!
I knew it was going to be when I saw furst time playing d&d😂
1:13 VOX MACINA
This is true but good
I just learned a whole new weakness of myself. Jaiden as a Dragonborn.
THE CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE IN THE BEGINNING
Jajajajajjaaja in the door answer someone should shout "n4k3d grama" jajajajajaja
honestly i would personally love if jaiden or jacob were guests on Just Roll With It so they can experience the mayhem of charlie as a player instead of only his fever dream style dming lmao
THE ACID LOLLLL
Brilliant!!!!
You should try out some other ttrpg systems, it'd be fun to have an animated series about the different kinds they are. And it's fun to discover new systems as well!
YOOOOOOO LETSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
okay the reveal of mark and thomson being the same person genuinely caught me by surprise
d&d wooooo
First of all i want to thank you for making videos full of fun, joy and adventure like this one D&D. I will never know the fun but you helped me to experience the happens of the game. So please accept my treasure. 💎💎💎💎💎
I love the fact that Alpharad basically Larry from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet is.😂
PLEASE DO ANOTHER ONE! I love d&d, and these guys are my favorite content creators so this is basically heaven for me.
This was very good
Why Alpharad is literally Larry from pokemon😂😂
You’re character is without a doubt the most absolutely unhinged and chaotic evil character I have ever seen 💀
That was great! I always love when people try out a new hobby and talk about it. Tbh I became a little paranoid, because yesterday I started playing Wind Waker with my best friend and then i hear Windfall Island's theme, when de adventure started and was like *WTF*?
Is it me or did jaidens character look like suzie from deltarune
RANBOOOOO
Please do another dnd vid like this
CRITICL ROLE REFER3NCEEESSSS
Wait! Turtle! What about the turtle!?
That was amazing, that was actually amazing
as soon as i heard "slimecicle" i knew that this would be unmatched tomfoolery
💀💀💀
Love the way there‘s this wholesome moment between Mark and „his“ wife and then just straight violation going on right after 😭
Lol Alpharad is basically Larry
..is that Larry?
AHHH with ranboo too! omg jaiden literally this year i have become obessed with dnd this is PERFECT
Hahahahaha! Ah, you can count how many nat 1s were rolled in this campaign.
)
tell James to look at my comment( btw you are super cool
JAIDEN THAT WAS THE BEST EVER OH MY GOODNESS!! PLEASE KEEP PLAYING DND ITS THE BEST EVER AND WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE ANIMATEDS OF THEM
Animated D&D sessions are fun to watch
hi
as a dnd player for a long time now i wanted tonsay that this video was great i liked the video very much i hpe you would play more and do more videos like that
Zoot being unreasonabley cute this whole animation.
Welcome to the group, i hope your journey in the world of DnD fares well
paul is a mood... i think i love paul
Charlie took the classic talking sheep oneshot and completely disregarded everything but the sheep itself I love it
hmm, characters at 1:15 look awfully familiar...
This was amazing!!!
Ok, we need more of dnd content, I loved it and I think everyone else did too
Larry Alpharad is fucking hilarious
this was awesome! pen and paper storys ara always fun to hear.
“The oak tree turns into a birch tree” oh no I’ve played Minecraft so I know how bad it is
You can easily spot each nat1 : D
A vox mochina cameo?!
Thiis was so adorable omg i absolutely love it please make some more animated sessions in the future
This was beautiful. 👏👏👏
Absolutely loved it, couldn't stop laughing 😂
Ah, "A wild Sheep Chase". An awesome module for beginners. Loved it, but my players hated the mage in sheeps clothing :D
JACOB ALPHARAD AS LARRY LETSSSSS GOOOOOOOO
Paul looks like kart from Pokémon scarlet
*DEPRESSION*
What a trip of a story. I would have never thought to think like this. It’s great.
When your name is The Peeler, you only have two options. 1. Be a horrifying little murderer who skins anyone you can, or 2. Be a jolly lil’ potato carver. Your choice
PAUL.
Would dm for you goobers in a heartbeat haha.
Ah yes, randomization at its finest.
Did they just make deltarun Chapter 3
This was the most chaotic session I've ever saw.
loved seeing vox machina 🥺
👏👏👏👏we need more of this plz jaiden
One time me and my friends played a TTRPG in the game of thrones setting and I managed to pull of a super important political assassination that lead to the creation of a new nation at the cost of my characters life.
I really thought mark was just gonna get stabbed in the back however that was infinitely times funnier
Dang that was awesome!
Pls do more such videos
The character arc between Paul and Luap are better than most Hollywood stories nowadays.
Couldn't understand a word of the doors but acid breath to the face made up for it 🤣
So so cool
col
I never clicked faster on a notification. This was wild and definitely needs to be a series I’m sorry
I can hear slime saying all of this stuff-
When your character do that spell and actuation i thought that you gonna convince mark to left the fight but the thing you did was awesome too
This was ssssoooo much fun to watch !
❤❤
HEY I SAW A VOX MACHINA REFERENCE IN THE BEGINNING WHAT I DIDNT KNOW PEOPLE WATCHED THAT SHOW
This video is pure genius, it genuinely made my day, thank you Jaiden
lmfao funniest shit ive ever seen D&D only sounds fun when its animated just like Vox Machina my imagination isnt good so actually being able to see it makes me wanna play but can't :v
Oh the Vox machina cameo❤
now that youtube has figured out how to get around my adblocker, i got a D&D themed car ad, which makes me want to vomit
Really enjoy your videos  Your animating has gotten better in comparison to your older ones
Tbh I think jaiden should Play little nightmares 2! I know she doesn’t take ideas But she could
Please make this a series jayden. PLEASE
Uh ... you should pin me ! For no reason.
Didn't expect the critical role reference x)
Loved this
DEPRESSION 💀
I like that Jaiden and Ranboo Is Furry in D&D, but Alpharad Being Larray.
I'm sry I watched it 14 hours late
4:16 i swear that one on right  is regerence to something but i cant figure out what it is
THAT PURPLE THING IS FROM ADVENTURE TIME OH MY GOD
I’d love to see more dnd videos
i want to play dnd, but i have no friends to play with :((((
Love the animation good job on the engaging story keep crushing it
AAA I LOVE THISS ID LOVE TO SEE MORE DND STUFF THIS WAS SO FUN TTO WATCH I WANNA PLAY DND TOO NOW😭😭💖💖💖
♡
Also, is it "Zoot" as in "Bad, naughty Zoot" the head handmaiden of Castle Anthrax?
the animation on this video is SO GOOD!! mother is mothering
I PLAY MY FIRST DND SESSION IN YEARS, AND JAIDEN UPLOADS HER FIRST DND GAME THE SAME DAY. WHAT THE HELL???
You should do more of this
Love that she included the reactions to her trick
I SEEN THAT VOX MACHINA EASTER EGG
As someone whose entire knowledge of DnD comes from BG3 , You should play BG3
Yeah they where definitely the bad guys. Poor mark.
I can only imagine the DM thought process after the party decides the most logical way forward is to eat the clay. "Uhhhhh, the fuck do I do now?!" "RESET!"
Thanks jaiden for making me want to use unusable puzzles now you’ve shown them to the world
This video was amazing!!!
i need to get a DnD group together, i love to be creative and stuff so it seems like it'd be really fun
I love d&d
Okay but I’m still impressed by how mark tanked a Dragonborn tackle, an axe in the gut, and point blank acid breath
zebra
love it!!!
Yes please upload the dnd session.  This is already awesome, the session must have been so awesome and fun.
Ok this is cool but. Anyone know Marks brother named Joe?
Ye olde mart of wall😂😂😂😂
I got the over the garden wall reference and I am very happy with myself
Paul's new nickname is draco Malfoy
Dragon born on top
I was pissing myself by the end xd
You can’t be serious, me and my friends are gonna play dnd for the first time today and you release this the day before. How
So you made some one depressed then appeared as his death wife to acide blast him ?
i am big fan of Zoot's tongue-brand magic circle thing being the source of their magic
CRIT ROLE REFERENCE IS SO COOL
SHE POSTED AGAIN YAYAAYAY
I remember the first time I watched your videos became a Jaidenfan, I knew I wanted to see you make a d&d video.…..  that was 5 years later and I’m so excited to see this!!!!    JUST FINISHED THE VIDEO! I enjoyed this so much!!!!
Jaiden never fails to make us laugh with her humor and her quality animation. Thank you Jaiden ❤
anyone notice the vox machina character in some of the scenes ?
wait...RANBOO!?WHAT THE CRA-
A decade or two ago (let alone since inception, OOOOF), DnD was not popular at all. I'm 30, and growing up it was treated as the literal embodiment of evil. Along with Harry Potter. One of those came true... I didn't experience DnD until my mid 20's.  I am astounded at how such a simple idea of story telling and limitless creativity can still be regarded as a bad thing. Knowing that there are still kids growing up to this day, who are taught that creativity is just pure evil, terrifies and breaks me. Knowledge, open-mindedness, critical thinking...etc... It can be a real unreal forum of ideas and fun and respect.  It just makes me so giddy and sad at the same time. There are too many "parents" who punish their kids for no reason, for even just creating their own thoughts and realizing their own opinions.  slkjfl;asjdflkasjdflksdjf;askjf;laskjdf;sadkjf  Thanks for sharing Jaiden, that was super fun
I love larry alpha
This has to be my favorite D&D group.
3:09 jaiden got a bad roll?
By far your most entertaining video 🤩
This was amaIng ! Kudos to you jsiden !
anyone else realised Alpharad looks like Larry from Pokemon?
Yooooo a new video!
My experience with the great sheep adventure, we didn't even end up leaving the tavern we started at, someone cast fireball and ignited all the alcohol blowing the tavern up. The only surviving creature being the sheep. Good times
I loved it also i needet to lough about tabazi Ramboo and the depression. I would LOVE to se the aftermath or another adventure of the turtle Loving Chaos.
MOAR DND ZEZIONZ!
Paul really did Yeet his son lmao
If the cat was in a time loop which lasted a dys then how did Thompson spend years, becoming a dark wizard in revenge for the rumors?
0:23 NO WAYYYYYY 💀💀💀
That reveal at the end and everyone realizing the clues that had been planted. Golden
Does anyone know what class jaiden is? I can tell that ranboo is a bird and alpharad is a barbarian but what about jaiden
Guess slimecicle... GOOPED AROUND
I love how Alpha’s character is just Larry
Alpharad as larry was geniues
I'm sorry. I'm all for suspending disbelief and everything, but when you tell me that a Wal-Mart employee has never dealt with depression before it just knocks me right out of the story. I know this is fantasy and everything but come on, that's too hard to believe.
the picture of his wife and child both with moustaches.....insanely good
RANBOO IS TOO CUTE I FUCKING CANT
This was really fun! I would love to see the entire session. Is there already a vod up somewhere or will there be a full length video at some point?
Thalamoot was so cuddly
I like the idea of oak inn exploding every new adventure like a new story but also in oak inn and it explodes all the time
You should make this a series
Great video!
Personally on would happily watch more of these. I'm a big fan of DnD, but also haven't actually played... It's very interesting seeing how, new people deal with stuff and how often it is very much not how you're "supposed to" (Although, why? Why did you eat the clay? Macing te sheep, I get. Wooly herd animal just Kool Aid man's in and appears to have some scroll in its mouth, i'dda magic missiled him myself (not really wizard are basically an easy 1 hit UP 1st level) but why. Why eat. The clay?
“I wish I was” Same bro
Yeah a DND Animation and the cast of vox machina is there 😅
I love that alpha is just fucking Larry from Pokémon
adventure time
I loved watching y’all play DND!! Praying for you and Jacob get on Dimension 20 to play a short series with Brennan Lee Mulligan - he’s one of the best DMs ever!
Love the vid, and absolutely adored the Vox machina reference
I'm glad you chose the dragonborn they're the best
this video brought me so much joy omg
Paul so-long-gay-bowser'd the sheep 💀i cant
So unhinged        I love it
Seeing Keyleth, Vex, Pike, and Grog in this makes me really want a Jaiden x Critical Role collab. An animated one shot with some CR cast members as guest voice actors. ❤
15:29 is the best part "THEN PROCEEDS TO ACID BLAST"
The animations of the team bopping their heads in the outro are soooooo cuteeee 😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💗 I literally couldnt stop myself from bopping along         I had a really shit day so thank you jaiden, ur humor and top quality content never fails to make me smile :')
Opagananstar
The turtle just dissappeared half way through, did they leave him behind to  die?
This mutha legit just Mystiqued this man as his wife, then went Zygeist on him.... New players are savage.
This was epic
Alpharad looks like Larry from Pokemon SV.
had huge smile on my face after doing a pogchamp when i saw kayleth and vex then grog and pike
VOX MACHINA
Omg this was amazing i hope to see more
My first time playing was a month ago lol
12:37 I like how this phrase turned into a verb 💀
I was hopping they found a jar of farts  😂to use it as a weapon.. yes that's a reference
Great video, that sounds like a fun custom-made campaign for someone to get started with the genre!  Also, does anyone know the music that plays for the clay monster fight? I know that I've heard it before and it's awesome but I cannot figure it out at all.
Zoot uses Depression! It is Super Effective!
DnD stories are kewl, give us more! 🎉❤
DAYUM! ur animation has improved so MUCH when i first watched u keep up the good work!
"This next Song is called 'I am so sad, so very, VERY sad...." "SO SAD!!!"
So Tholomule/Ranboo's character called his nemesis Thomas first then you just called him Thompson every times afterwards, which one was the mistake?
This video was absolutely hilarious you need to make more 😂
imagine adding recorded voice acting of characters by players???
"The Peeler" was 100% named by either Charlie or Ranboo
I saw critical role characters! lets go ~
I. LOVE IT. Thank you for every video Jaiden.
best part was "paul so long gay bowsers the sheep" lmfaoo
This felt more like a tv show than a YouTube video lol neeeed more.
sheesh, youde rather throw a dagger at somebody's eye and eat clay than make a clay statue?
Ranboo is literally Phil from Groundhog Day in this
Did Mark say that he is hard?
Why getting flashbacks about Jaiden playing D.N.D🤔🤔🤔
1:15 Vox Machina is great
Why do I remember this campaign?
this is my all time favourite jaiden video by far
This was awesome but if you could add the dies being rolled for a brief animation and a Baldurs gate like sound effect that would be amazing.
i love alpharad's ace attorney hair lmao
this is so unhinged i love it so damn much
D&D is like if you mixed final fantasy with looney tunes
we need more!!!!÷]
Ayo jaiden talking in third person???!!!!?!! Paul was the best character actually top tier
Ranboo is so short I love it
This was amazing, welcom to the DnD world :D
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
Whoo! That was a beautiful story and gorgeously animated!😊
3:08 real bruh moment
I love that Jacob is just Larry
i want this to be series so bad LOVED THE VIDEO
My D&D groups are idiots let’s throw someone in the air and make them use fireball and summon a bone demon
Its been a long time I have heard the voice of a female youtuber, i thought a child was speaking in the video until i looked at the screen
that was cool
I have never played D&D before
I actually feel kind of bad for Mark
This was the truest form of D&D
1:33 A man in a suit started a casual conversation with an ad 💀
😂 i love DnD for its endless possibilities. Who could ever find such Ideas in a normal way to write them down 💖
I'm so glad you had fun!!! I have a group of friends who I play DnD with. It's fun!!
Can you do a Pokemon fire red nuzlock
If you can do another one this one was so entertaining
Still don’t really understand how it works    I’m an idiot
My favourite part was when everyone just ate the clay and thought that would solve the puzzle
wait, why would a dragon girl need to use a speak with animals spell? you're part animal
PLEAAASEEEEE JOIN JUST ROLL WOTH IT!!!
One-shot was very Slime's style. Love it!
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
I love how Vox Machina was a little easter egg in there, you should collab with Dingo doodles since they're also an animator, but more focused towards dnd :DDD
My favourite video by you, by far! Haha, this was great!
Your game especially Poul inspired me to return to DnD.
That is the funniest way to use Command I’ve ever seen
Love the "Over the Garden Wall" reference in the background
The animation went hard af this video
I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so much at a video. This was so funny
I love that Jacobs character looks a litle like Lary from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
EX MONICA?! Mohica? I forgot the name, the DND series omg i love that series
Bruh alparad character is just him but larry
❤🎉
iI loved this type of video and hope u could make more❤
Shouldve learnt vicous mockery
D&D, Drama & Depression,  in the Catacombs of corporate character corruption!  The Sheep in wolves clothing!!  Good vid.
I’m crying, wtf?
Man, those encounter soundtracks are bangin. 😊
I was taking notes at all because I also played d&d with friends. And thank you for mentioning point blank acid breath. I now have ideas
Oh my god i just realized that alphards character is literally just Larry from Scarlett and Violet
is that shepherd's crossing soundtrack i hear
Acid blasted from the mouth 15:28
I’ve always wanted to play dnd and I’ve designed dnd characters and stuff but whenever I suggest it to my friends they wanna do something else, I think I need new friends 😢
I saw that bong water
I’ve still never played D&D, interested to see how you do :)
I love hearing anything Charlie Slimecicle related to D&D, (I am a JWRI nerd) and then add in JAIDEN? AND JACOB? AND RAN? IM VERY EXCITED
as a walmart worker i giggled bc a yellow name tag with black letters means the worker is a minor lol
Never thought I'd see Jaiden talk bout D&D and have Slimcicle and Ranboo in a video 😁😁😁💜
she whips out her...mace... I think there was a ...heh. whatever. it's cool. xD  What a wacky story. Thank you for animating this ^^
hahhh I wish my campaign was even half as fun.. somehow we're always just going from one battle to the next one
lol
im so happy she posted agauin
The point blank acid breath, that was fucking cold, Jaiden, damn! 🤣
I love when the worm said ITS WORMIN TIME and wormed all over the place
8:09 You knew exactly what you were doing playing masked dedede when there was a penguin around
12:36 bruhh🤣🤣
"Paul so-longee-bowser's the sheep into the air"  What a great verb
A DnD campain I'm in allowed homebrew, which allowed me to increase my intimidation modifier to plus fifteen, which was insane, as the first time I was imprisoned I rolled a nat 20 in intimidation, which was then a 35 because of the modifier, so I got to Ocarina of Time the moon to scare my chains off and make my captive run away in fear. God that was a great session.
I played D&D and the dm let me marry the boss
didnt expect to have charlie slimecicle in a jaiden animations video BUT HEY IM ALL HERE FOR IT
What a movie man...Great job Jaiden🥳
Loving the Fuecoco at 4:14 in the bushes 😂
This in every way is a very typical dnd session and that was just the funniest lololol
WHY IS ALPHARAD LARRY 😭
Welcome to the crazy world of dnd
Sounds like the most sane dnd party I’ve heard of lol
The first time i played DND i entered the like 5th session with a boss battle 😭😭
I laughed at Paul’s story
very fun dnd video
THIS WAS THE BEST THING EVER
Ehh... Since when does Dungeon and Dragon have remote detonation and C4?!
Larry—er, I mean *Paul* doing the sign of the cross when the goblin fell to his death GOT me. 🤣🤣👌🏻👌🏻
The wax machina reference
that was so cool love to see more
I’m sorry, but the door face’s facial expressions, over the top-ness, and the way it was animated remind me of Hooty from The Owl House (an annoying, gatekeeping bird with a really weird voice who gets hit in the eye for saying riddles, too.) It took me a bit to realize why I found the door face so familiar and funny.
Wow I didn’t realize you knew so many people that are on YouTube
❤❤🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🍔
Alpharad basically being Larry is extremely funny.
ID LOVE for Jaiden to animate a dnd session. It be an amazing series
i plad dnd and my favrit cherikter i mad ( my sisters bf acksuly mad it ) whas a hafe dragon so a dragon born  . (-:
Vox machine reference is excellent
I adore this. And I adore it even more because I'm a giga nerd and can recognise everything for everything ToT XDDD
I love the vox machina reference
God dang. I have 3 things to note. First of all, when Coconut Mall started, we all knew that chaos will happen. Second, in the second team attack against the manager (already forgot their name) you can see the chaos in Tholomule's eye. He woke up that day and chose chaos. And third, when the name thing was revealed, I literally had the same reaction. All in all, this was great, do more, bye bye
Furry moment
Hey will become a new animator am I will meet you one day please respond if not that fine I’ll see you soon
More i want more
1:15 they look familiar, hmm
My friend accidentally seduced a goblin because she rolled a 20, also the dragonborns backstory envolved getting enslaved by dragons 😊
THIS VIDEO IS SO CHAOTIC I LOVE IT. I WAS DYING AT THE END WITH MATKS EX WIFE AND LUAP
Please do more of these im a begging on my knees i will give you my life savings
The adventure time reference 😂
1:13 I GOT THE REFERENCE! Is it Thursday yet?
Vox machina reference let's gooooooooo
Do another one
More of this.       Just play D&d and make awesome videos of the campaign your in.      This is your best video yet I can’t give you more then a like but if I could ten thousand likes just from me for making a awesome D&d video!
what :/
This made my smile so fucking big. Just seeing the person that never failed to make my day even a little bit better, the one that's been my escape from reality for almost 3 years now, my favorite silly slimey guy(idk what to say about Charlie sorry love you😭),and the person that got me threw 2020 make a video together is actually amazing. I love and appreciate you all for all you've done for me<33
Now i want play as Larry from pokemon, He's such a character
a cute one shot, i would love to see a campaign
18:46 my god that's so fucked up
9:51 omg the fcking horse from adventure time 😭
Dingo Doodles collab when?
Relatively surprised you didn't go aarakocra considering the love of birdos
Honestly wish the guys voiced themselves would've been more fun either way good video
I think we can all agree we need more dnd videos
Alpharad is just Larry
the animation is genuinely super impressive
The music is so well fitted, who knows the name of all of them, I just recognised two or three
yay jaiden video
Wow a collab between four of my favorite YouTubers of all time this is amazing
Jaiden's character looks like Susie from Deltarune.
Oh jade your subs gone down 💀
Jaiden is Susie
I think ranboo is the cat cat ranboo looks cute
Teach me
Bro Mark is Numbah zero from code name kids next door
My first DnD session was amazing, had all the things needed like a random crit, critical fail at the worst of times and a DM that wasn’t scared to make us look like idiots. Good times.
that was fantastic ^^ thank jaiden
jaiden being a dragonborne makes so much sense and i don't know why
i’m pissed, how come she gets to do this before me?  now i’m gonna be petty for the next 3 minutes.
❤Love this!!!
how did i know exactly what jaiden was going to do to poor mark thompson😥jk it was funny as hell🤣
Do this more
I never played it as well and some times I never knew it existed
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!
Wow, this was amazing!
Cooll
This is too casually of her talking D&D xd a
Was not expecting to see Grog, Pike, Keyleth, and Vex in the first minute and a half of the video
Paul’s just Nanami fr
Love the vox machina reference!
THATS SO COOL!! MY FIRST TIME I PLAYED DND WITH MY UNCLE I WAS A DRAGONBORN (GREEN) NAMED NORA! IT WAS SO MUCH FUNN :D
Omg Jaden that was the best video I have ever seen so keep on doing that It was a good video
Don't listen to him he's a zebra. Listen to the cat instead.
I've played a version of this adventure. Ours ended with an NPC getting turned inside out.
I actually screamed when I saw this thank you
W voice acting
One simple request... MORE!
W
The wheezing at the disguised acid breath was priceless
This is my favourite video you’ve ever made. Being a huge fun of D&D as well you, this video was epic. The characters and story were awesome
I like watched half of the vid for this campaign, it’s now great to see it animated
what a video XD bruh haduse
12:45 I recognize that music! Team Dim Sun forever!
This sounds just like how my D&D sessions go! 😂
I just finished BG3 and I needed to drink some alcohol after it because emotions were too strong and after that I see your new video. It's a perfect timing
We need a second session
I love the casual Vox Machina cameo that's awesome.
16:12 one the best performences from Jaiden here
Of course ranboo is a bard 😭 also i hate that goddamn horse from AT I’m glad the goblins are eating him
It was so awesome when you did the session, and now it's animated???? Hell Yessss
At my last campaign, I slit an immortal chicken's neck and delt 10d6 thunder damage to the enemy. The chicken is pretty much wild magic on every single drug imaginable, the two most prominent aspects of The chicken is that if you roll a nat 99 - 100, you summon an Eldridge god to insta kill your target, but if you get a 3 or lower, you immediately die... I used it within the first 10 minutes and I will keep using it every chance I get
D&D is as wild as the people playing it! Every group can be so, so different, even if in the same world. It's a truly brilliant freeform way to spend time.
isnt that the horse from adventure time? at 9:50
FUCK YEAH I LOVE DRAGONBORN
I actually realised Luap was somehow related to Paul immediately cause my friends and i ised to call each other by our names backwards
D AND D IS THIS SAME GAME FROM RIVERDALE SERIES 🤨
They, they, they, they, they. So boring!
Yay more dnd animation! Welcome to the unique chaos it brings
first?
I hadn’t even watched the video but I knew there was a good chance Jaiden would play a Dragonborn, this was absolute chaos and insanity but yeah that about sums up my experience with dnd as well
Not even 30 seconds there's a bard joke
D&D Is good.
I mean... Some DM/GMs use tabletop boards to manage scenes... Not all of them, but some.  Also, Paul sounds like Larry, amd I'm here for it... But I'm jealous of that cat.  Also... All this sounds like fun. Paul is my spirit animal...

Haha, one time someone in my party tried to seduce a chest. Uh. Yeah. We also cut off eachothers hands
Hhahaha she’s trapped in the loop forever now. May she eat a baguette from the village’s smith.
NOBLE WUZ HERE
My first character was a warlock half elf. He almost died first game but lived to lvl 13. Where he sacrificed himself for his sister, who I then played
Hey Jaiden I dare you to do a Pokemon dark worship nuzlocke
❤ Paul jr
I really want to play dnd
Pls pls pls pls plz pls do more of this
Learning how to play dnd<<<<<<<learning how to play watching jaiden making a detailed animation on it
Things only in pnp can happen
roll for more DnD videos
This video made me burst out laughing at so many points. I hope we get to see more! Also brilliant visual storytelling!
Wai wai WAIT I SAW A DRAGON IN THE SKY!!! SO THAT MEANS IT'S  NOT THE END!!!
AAAAAAH I PLAY COPPER DRAGONBORN TOO!!
I can't believe you finally played D&D, don't stop!
0:51 have not watched the whole video, and now I know charlie has been given too much power
Love that you used Outset Island as the bg music ❤️‍🔥
Love how alpharad just became larry from pokemon lol
Hey please make another pokemon nuzlocke video ıt,s been enougth time
The vox machina cameo lmfao
Jaiden, thanks to you I have begun planning a D&D campaign with my uni history club, any and all shenanigans will be blamed on you
This is really the FIRST time I’ve seen Ranboo the shortest in the room. Never the first time as a cat, though, strangely enough.
I wished everyone i knew played dnd
Oh. My. GOSH that was amazing! AAA! Like, this reminds me of when you posted that first Nuzlocke video, like, that feeling of, holy shit, your production quality just keeps increasing, and your videos just keep getting better by the post, even though they were already amazing to begin with~ I honestly hope we'll see more D&D videos in the future! Thank you for this~
Fun Fact: Milk gives cats diarrhea because they are all lactose intolerant.
Yup, that sounds like a character Jacob could become. I mean he usually gets characters imposed on him by his chat so at least this time he gets to make something himself
omg larry
I need more D&D stuff like this, even though I haven't played D&D before this video made it look and sound really fun
It can also be played with a board.
did only i see that jaden's avatar is most powerful here?
I LOVED THIS OMG
If you watch gravity falls theres A game like this the name is dungeons, dungeons, And more dungeons
The dragon In the end shows there is more to come maybe xD
Wait...so the sheep got thrown by Paul multiple times....Paul was throwing his own son 😭
Let me join NOW
Loving this! I also had my first DnD experience a while ago and it was equally as chaotic 😂
ALPHARAD IS JUST LARRY
one time I was on 1hp and tried to bluff a dragon into believing that a normal, ordinary hammer (cleaned to be exceptionally shiny) was more powerful and more valuable than the items I was caught stealing from him and it fucking worked
14:24, "You know what this is? This is the world's smallest violin playing just for the waitresses." - Reservoir Dogs
I remember being late to the dnd stream, and joining RIGHT when Jaidens character used disguise self to turn into the guys ex wife and I’m so glad I can finally sorta hear the whole story that led up to it
1:14 hell yeah Critical Role reference!!
This was honestly a cute story and I hope you all have equally fun adventures together in the future.   Also dragonborn as your first pick. Respect. 😎
I like how alpha was turned into larry
This was AMAZING
9:51 was the horse a reference to that one weird ass horse thing...from Adventure Time-??
Sick
The wildest thing in my dnd sessions right now has been the fact that we were sent to the moon by accident, got stuck there, time traveled to help a beholder, and created a time god who really doesn’t like us
Woo! One of us, one of us! 😁 But damn, Jaiden: using Command to give someone depression? That's dark 😅 (I may just be jealous because I can't seem to *ever* get my Command to work 😂)  Your campaign seems to have a similar tone to Smosh's "Sword AF", which is great! And much lighter than my current campaign, in which my character has had to watch two family members die (one after being zombified), and a third -- a baby sister -- get absorbed into an NPC's body in some weird time variant shenanigans. (That just happened at the end of our session *literally today* so no, I still have no idea what's going on there 😂) When I first made my character, I said, "I'm doing something different and making a character with a happy family who loves him!" And our DM said, "Don't worry, I'll fix that." I think... he may have accepted that challenge too hard 😅  Anyway, I would love to see actual play content from your games, if you want to put them up, so I'll just quietly wait with calm hype for that second channel upload 😁  (And from the animation... can we assume your party was in the tavern during Vox Machina episode 1? 😂)
Nice vox makina
Was that Yoshikage Kira?
As a long-time DnD player i love when the DM ends the campaign with everything connecting perfectly
"And we ended up eloping"
This is every beginning DnD session. People meet up and decide to follow each other
Alpharad looks like Gary from pokemon scarlet and violet
No way Jacob made a baggage-filled fantasy Larry from pokemon SV.
Suit guy is just Sanji haha
I alweys love when you (jaiden animations) animate games😂😂😊☺️🙂
14:23 Is that a World's Tiniest Violin?
Oh, since you’re doing this episode, they should probably say oh are you special day? We taste birthday we played a little role-play game, the same role-play game, where I pretended to be a cat, wearing a pumpkin mask, and I created little pumpkin bombs in the ears on the imagination I didn’t I didn’t actually car row pumpkin it’s to make bombs out of them before it before the BSDI comes after me. OK not be of the idea the do you know my name do you know what I mean but anyways and your birthday and you didn’t entire city let me explain so I was a turtle living in the underwater city, and I created a massive pumpkin bomb made out of all the leftover tops of every single pumpkin bomb ever made I got a call from my team saying they needed it and then they looked the entire place but water city was OK. I said there was another time. Where are you added Pokémon to a different role-play game mom wasn’t she would she didn’t expect that to happen
beautiful
As a long-time Jaiden enjoyer and recent Dimension 20 addict, i am elated
0:55 O MY GOD THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MOST CHAOTIC PARTY 17:25 THIS WAS AN AMAZING ONE SHOT AND MY LIFE IS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME
Ah yes, DnD where your character share their deepest secrets right after meeting someone.
I love dnd and it was so great to see you finally do a dnd video; hope to see more!
I can’t believe alpharad doesn’t like musicals (if someone gets that reference you have my upmost respect)
2 months of waiting 2 MONTHS OF WAITING 😕
I love that game my family plays it!
that was fantastic
i just love the expression on them so much
I played dnd last week and in the game i asked a blind italian nic cage how his kidnaped wife LOOKS like what i played as klutsy the clown what do did you was going to happen-.
Paul reminded me of larry
Please do more
truly the most unexpected yet wonderful collab
Jacob roleplaying as Larry I see
6:21 I love how puns are now so baked into Slimecicle that he couldn't not give the answer away accidentally.
I’ve never seen command used like that before. I’m gonna have to put Depression on the back burner for my next DnD encounter 😂
It would be so cool to play a D&D game and then see it animated months later. Its an experience that not many people get to be a part of.
My first (and only) DND character was a “High Elf” named Mark. He is 420 years old (which translates to about human age 50). He’s a bard, and has a moveset & stats specifically designed for gaslighting people. He can inexplicably speak to demons and has a near-endless supply of weed to keep the party in high spirits. When things are looking rough, he cheers the party on by playing fitting music on bagpipes (such as the soundtrack to “The Shining” while the others break down doors with an axe). The first time he looked at a corpse he had such a strong reaction that he was possessed by god and given a legendary power. He has very little memory of how he got here but is happy to tag along with the party and do whatever it is that he does (The rest of my party wasn’t much better lol)
seems like you guys just rolled with it, but thats just me
Wholesome ending to a silly campaign.  But you also may have been the bad guys from another angle 😅
James jaiden double trouble today!
9:53 that thing reminds me of that eye horse from adventure time
Love the vox machina group easteregg
I NEED a entire cartoon show of these 3 Ong
It was funny and great and Jaiden is so awesome
Omg I love it AHHHH WHY IS ALL THE PLOTTWIST JUST GREAT I wish I could play d&d 😢❤
Welcome to the club my friend
Player 1: *shoots there bow into the heavens*  Me: god (me) throws a bolt of lighting at you. You lose 3 hp and become a dog
Why did I lose it at “Yee ol mart of Wal.”
Alpharad playing as basically Larry from Pokemon SV is really funny
When I stole the dungeon master chair then instantly faced a chair monster
I love how paul is just larry from pokemon
I feel bad for mark I wanted him to win why werid cat guy for spreading rumors I hope you roll a natural 1 on staying alive check
15:29 so hilarious
This is way better then sitting on a table with dice 😂
Once my friends spent all their money at Gary’s Goat pen and brought about 50 per goats even though I actually thought of really good names for all the other places. Turns out the bad guy was allergic to goats
That was unhinged as fuck. I loved every second of it.
2:25 THE SUSIE-LIKE FACE IN DELTARUNE ON JAYDENS CHARACTER IS SO GOOD
This was quite a wild ride for your first game!
Im glad that disguise part was put in. I only knew about it because of a clip.
This was AMAZING! Please, please do more!
Welcome to the D&D chaos where anything can happen including a siamese cat helicopter
I’m a huge fan of D&D and love playing I’m so happy you got to play and enjoyed it! Also shoutout to the Vox Machina reference!! My boy Grog looked so good!
I died from trying to sit on a chair I rolled a nat one and then a force field was put a round me when I sat on the chair then 20 fire balls come from the chair and I’m disintegrated funnies way I’ve ever died
Loving the immediate Vox Machina reference in the Inn at the start.
And then the worm said "its wormin' time" and wormed all over the place, truly a moment in D&D history
You literally just manipulated a man in his 40s
I do the same thing with my dragonborns breath weapons all the time!  Breathing in somebody's face at point-blank range it's the best thing ever to describe😂
That introduction makes it seem like Calvinball.  It's more like a ruleset upon which you can play a more ordered, story-like version of Calvinball
This video was released just as my friends and I were about to play a session lol
That was by far the most non chaotic dnd game I’ve ever heard!
VOX MACHINA!!!
As a fellow dnd player this is definitely how my dnd session usually go
This was so funny omg. Would love to see more
14:44 i knew this was coming and i was waiting for it this whole video
Funny
I loved the story
this was a lot of fun to watch!!
Paul reminds me of Larry from Pokemon scarlet 😂
it is awesome
This was utter insanity. I've been playing DND and similar games for years and never have I experienced this level of pure chaos.
I love how you can tell what dice rolls they got 😂
D&D is so perfect for your channel! Please please please do more
I just started playing dnd and this video is made COINCIDE I think yea of course
10:14 oh my do i spy with my little eye an adventure time refrence??
An absolute masterpiece 🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌
Jaiden.. i swear to god, if you keep drawing your characters cute like that, next time i watch one of your videos im 100% passing out.
This a cheat code
that turtle is a jojo reference
Bong water
DEPRESSION
THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME😭😭
So I got to the part where ranboo's character says "I've been stuck in a time loop for about 3 years," went to pick up my phone, and *accidentally rewound* back to the start of the video. I questioned if it was a gag for a few seconds, and it's not, but that was some great timing 😂
is paul literally just blonde larry from pkmn s/v
i love paul lmfao
unsubscribe just for fun
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Fun fact: a majority of people who watched this so far have commented.
I remember my first dnd game ever. From what I remember we started a human trafficking ring pyramid scheme and tamed a dragon we named Idaho or something.
I would love to join the next game, but i know i most likely won't. I'm free most days after 6pm, if that helps my chances any.
I think if you do more you should cycle through (if possible) so alpharad was the game master and Slimecicle was playing then ranboo and so on
Alpha's character is just Larry but buff and blond. XD
:D
Did anyone else see vox machina in the start of the inn?
Based taste in character, gotta say.
Did any of you see the adventure time reference?
I see a new vid by Jaiden animations: YES LET THE CHAOS ENSUE. It's about D&D: NO SHOT MY ENTIRE LIFE HAS CULMIMATED TO THIS MOMENT
This was amazing
4:32 nice Over the Garden Wall reference!! I just finished rewatching it today lol
I have also been an ogre eloper
This was perfect
Orange
8:23 it’s wormin time!!!🗣️🗣️🗣️💯💯🔥🔥🔥
I am already subscribed
The "YOU'RE MY PERSONAL HELL" hit hard at the end
In my dnd campaign there’s this one guy when ever he rolls a bad perception check he sees Freddy fazbear for fnaf. Also we’re the military in our campaign
The darklord told me to ask for more. MOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Reminds me of a Wild Sheep Chase by Winghorn Press, one of my favorite modules.
1:58 yoshikage kira fr
Please do more of this. I love this video.
Ayyy this was real cool, more pls
I’m so happy to see this Jaiden! I’m glad you got to experience the joy of DND! May there be more sessions!
If I was the wizard and saw that it was Paul's child I would've turned there child into a worm then take them and never give them back just to ruin the good ending
Y is Paul so hot...
I can't get over Alpharad just RPing as a Larry.
i love that you added Critical Role's characters (Grog, Keyleth, Pike, and Vex.) !! Cant wait to see more of your great adventures and stories!
This was an absolute joy to watch. I miss playing D&D so much and this really made me smile.
Dragon jaiden
More plzzzz 😂😂😂
1:21  Ok Ramboo being a cat race made my day and he looks cute. :3  Jadien being a dragonborn also made my day cause that kinda my favorite race design-wise
THIS VIDEO IS AMAZING
I love the Vox Machina reference!!
I am attracted to Paul🙌
Man I loved playing dnd When I was younger  Me and my friend made some very questionable stories while playing
what happened to the bird of goat satan
This is so cringe, i love it :3
Yeah.
This is one of my favorite videos on this channel
0:56 FURRY CONFIRMED?!?!?!🤨📸📷📸📷📸📷📸📷📸📷📸📷📸📷📸📷💀💀💀💀💀💀👁️👄👁️🐟
i loved this. We need more!
Ok. I JUST started the video. Did Alpharad make a character based off of Larry from Scarlet/Violet!?
The acid breath moment was hilarious   My most unhinged game moment, the beginning and end of a bitter, unscripted vendetta.  My party was traveling to an old castle when we were jumped by a group of goblins. We managed to kill all but 2. We tied one up and put a knife to the other. We were trying to get information out of him but he wasn't budging so wre had to ramp it up. We told him to pick up a rock to unalive the other that we had tied up, or be unalived himself. As he approached the tied up goblin, she woke up and realized what was happening and said "its ok, honey. Do it". We very quickly found out they were married with kids after we looted her corpse and found a childs drawing of their family. After event's unfold, he escapes and fast forward to the end of the campaign, we find out that he's teamed up with the boss of the game and is the miniboss before the main. Almost as soon as the battle starts, one of the player's throws down an anti-graviry orb and plunges his sword in the ground. In the end, qe each took ranged shots at him sending him over an edge where he falls to his death.
D&D part 2?
I saw those cameos😮‍💨
Is the full campaign available?
Heard sheep and knew exactly what this was
Me when I heard Charlie was a god: gulp
I want see a live stream of this so bad I love d.n.d
Please more dnd! This was amazing!
only jaiden would roll a Nat 20 and still get chocked by a Worm
I woke up this morning and I saw this video and I went berserk because I am absolutely obsessed with dungeons and dragons and your Contant so my day just got absolutely better thanks a lot
I never played DnD before but I want to have my first session with my kids when they're old enough to understand. Where do I even start?
I love dnd! Great video :D
Paul looking like Larry is the most perfect thing ever.
Love the Vox Machina cameo
POV  Jayden: Where wtf are we!?💀💀
I truely thought party just dies in like 2 seconds you cant lie you thought about it.
That was gosh darn beautiful
Welcome to the world of dnd! I also love that little nod to Vox Machina at the start lol
CRITICAK ROKE REFRANCE
was that the horse from adventure time?
Helo😁
I see prominent figures by the first minutes which to me, indicates this is gonna be good. Hahaha VM hype
Why am I not surprised Jaiden chose a Dragonborn with her love of big chonky monsters😂
i remember that acid moment from a short i saw
Wow can you do another d&d it was crazy fun hahaha
Gotta love that I already knew that jaden was going to acid blast mark all because that’s what any other player I’ve ran with does
OMG PLEASE, I LITERALLY SCREAMEDDDDD WHEN I SAW THE REFERENCE TO VOX MACHINA 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Just a question which class was Jaiden I only knew she was a Dragonborn that could spit acid
music at  6:53?
I killed the final boss on the first turn of my D&D campaign with a Nat 20 and a bunch of explosives.
I swear every video her animation gets better and better. It's amazing!
And shouts depression! Lmao that had me crying
Nat 20 in the comments
I played D&D and I managed to be too cute for the law TWICE !!! ✨ 😂
That was such a good video. I’d love to see more of this.
Didn’t cry watching titanic, but… at about 15:30 with depression and stuff that was sad, more sad than the titanic
Did Jacob RP as Larry so his chat would finally root for him?
Are we gonna ignore the awesome character designs?
MARK DID NOTING VRONG
that sounds so epic, i'm gonna be doing my first d and d session with some ppl thats gonna be fallout themed so hopefully its as epic as this :>
My favorite thing in dnd is making the backstories for my characters and the stories we make
It's funny, today I will be the DM for my group, in which no one has played D&D before .
lol I want to work that riddle solving skill into my game. Tricking the person into using the answer in a sentence
so one time my party was trying to sneak into a circus but there was a guard guarding the entrance. Me being the slutty wizard I was attempted to seduce the guard to distract him. The problem was, he only liked beans. I ended up using disguise person to turn into a bean and then I seduced him and well… the party got into the circus while I was a little bit busy
A dragon, a cat, and a businessman walk into a bar where they are approached by a sheep… tell me this isn’t the start to the weirdest joke ever Edit: having now watched the video this is the funniest video I’ve seen all day
I kept trying to like the video like 3 times after I already liked it 😅🤦🏼‍♀️
Anyone else notice the vox machina party In the beginning
One time me and my party were fighting a hungry demon and I suggested that we cooked something for him instead! I made a choclate cake with chillis and fish guts and he really liked it
Oh this is was from the short I was were jaden transforms into the guys wife haha.
Jaiden Susie
When I saw the video pop up I started kicking my feet like omg FINALLYYYY
0:05 your imagination ISSSS the board
BRO I LOVE CHARLIE IN THE THUMBNAIL SO MUCH
Wait so where did you play this agian, also i still don't get the game. i..iii just..whaaa???but still very entertaining and funny,like jaiden :)  P.S: i thought your next video was about you playing omori game( no offense, i just thought of that).
OMG you played the wild sheep chase campaign, i love that one <3
More dnd stuff this is fun
It FINALLY HAPPENED!!! You played it, and you were great! Welcome to the  ̶c̶u̶l̶t̶ᶠᵃᵐᶦˡʸ!
Its amazing that you could see where the rolls are and how they landed without even mentioning it in the story 😂
10/10 ❤ it
It's always a mark or a Jeff!😂
Man, the Nat 1’s were coming like a waterfall.
you have jacob but where esau
In my DnD party my friend’s character keeps on trying to seduce doors and I was able to seduce a guy with showing my ankle promiscuously
Crossover of the year
1:40 it is Larry from pokemon
DAMN Mark tompson needs multiple levels of thearapy after Jaiden
so happy to see Larry playing the role of Paul 🤩
Now that is what i call a d&d adventure
10:13 that horse is from season 2 of adventure time man
Did catboo ever get out of their time loop though?
more animated dnd
im so glad i watched this high, it was so funny and crazyyyy
That was AMAZING!!!
Leave it to Jaiden to have the most chaotic dnd. 🤣🤣
How did I know it was going to be his dad the the main villain was going to be all of there problems 💀
My party is like this but with more war crimes and murder as well as the fact that the rogue has yet to make a successful attack roll
D&D Jaiden looks like Susie from DELTARUNE. Just saying.
That was so feccin fun ahaha, I cant wait to do a session myself one day  its hard rn with most of my dnd acquainted friends being in a different timezone, but this really gave me hope for when it can happen
"DEPPRESION!!!!!!!!"
I love it I want more please
Why is Paul just Larry from Pokémon scarlet violet ? 😂
Do more now.
Watching this video was like experiencing someones elses dream, i too hope one day i actually get to play dnd  Anyway scianoara (or hwvr u spell it) till next time
You know its gonna be unhinged when you let Gillian DM
This was so fun, You are a great story teller. Jaiden kinda gives Dark Mage vibes, I wonder how will she roleplay it without getting in the mess of starting zombie apocalypse lol
FINALLY, a full animated dnd campaign  on YouTube!
XD omg i love this already please do a part 2 XD i'm die laughter because of this!
Just so we're all on the same page, Alpharad's character Paul's just Larry from Pokemon right?
9:51 theres a adventure time reference the pony  from the eyes episode
Love the Vox Machina reference at @1:14
YALL GOTTA DO MORE!!!!!!!!
I got so ridiculously excited when critical role characters from campaign 1 came up :D
LMAO the fact that Paul is like an embodiment of Larry in SV.
YO! Paul was MVP!
She* put the turtle in her pack
that critical role/vox machina reference at the start threw me off guard lol
Was it different yesterday was it awesome also yes please do more of these
As a DnD player and DM myself. I love when people have fun at the game. The animation was amazing, and the storytelling was spot on for a DnD game. Would love to see more.
Omg the start looks like Larry from pokemon
I completely understand Paul's son, Paul jr.'s decision.
I love, how Jaiden (or whoever is picking up the musics in the background) uses the old style musics from games, like M&L superstar saga for example, since D&D is actually quiet old from what I heard
What the hell, is the horse being roasted the horse with poo brain from Adventure Time?
They killed ice king😭😭😭 10:24
Ive always wanted to try Dnd but my stamina with imagining stuff is so small that I don't think i would ever last a single session.
I love Tholomew, and I will destroy anyone who hurts him
Jaiden: TURTLE! 😂😂😂😂
Yuuuuus! Some day I'll get to play D&D with a good group!
I was right about the villain
This could be a series i get behind, ngl, the true chaos dnd group...
Im not the only one thinks that alparad looks like if sanji from one piece was slytherin
The ultimate team has been formed
i will be using bong water as a name from now on
I've never played Dungeons and Dragons before I wish I did TwT
Jacob being a Lary rip off is just so ironic
I love how you can tell that Ranboo rolled a Nat 20 because he wiped out like 90% of the goblins XDDD
I love this so much. Please make more videos of this campaign
bruh the horse from adventure time
Such a jaiden move to choose to play as a Dragonborn
If she aver plays more dnd with those 3 I hope she makes a nother animation about it like now
16:06 ARE THOSE IMPACT FRAMES
Bro I legit just started to join D&D club
paul looks like larry from scarlet and violet
I loved this video so much :3 the ending was my favorite, just heart warming ❤
I couldn't understand a damn thing the riddle door said.
Oh, my group would have roasted Luap for lamb chops...
Jaiden participating in Critical Role would be cool to watch
Paul is giving me I'M NOT SO GRUUUMP energy in some shots
i love slimecicle in your art style
This is so unhinged... I love it!
What an amazing one shot (I assume) and what an amazing video!!!
This was absolutely hilarious. CAN'T wait for you to do more...because you guys will play more... Right?right? 🥺🥺🥺
the push after alpha got turned into a zebra got me
THIS WAS SUCH A FUN VIDEO OMG 😭😭
Thank you for the critical roll easter egg it made me very happy
NOOOO THE GOBLINS ARE COOKING ICE KING NOOOOO😭😭😭😭😭😭
I would watch an endless amount of these
Tabaxi? I'm already sold. Edit: this story perfectly captured how silly tabaxi characters can be.
the super mario galaxy music was the cherry on top
I play dnd every week and love it
Funny how even without the hints you can guess whos who
YES TWO OF MY FAVORITE THINGS!!!!!!
IS THE HORSE AT 10:53 THE HORSE OCE KING HIDES IN IN ADVENTURE TIME???
It took this video for me to realize that one of my players named his character after Charlie Slimesickle… I live under a rock apparently.
God, Command is such a funny spell when used properly.  For the uninitiated, Command is a spell that, whenever a target fails to resist it, makes the target do almost anything that isnt directly harmful.   So yelling "DEPRESSION!" and someone going "oh man im sad now" is perfectly possible! I used mine once to make someone reveal they were tryna bw tficket, and they justw ent "oh god damn it"
1:13 the inclusion of Vox Machina made me very excited
"And you!... Paul.... Anyways" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I absolutely loved this. I would watch an entire session of these 4 playing D&D
I want more of this!
Peak D&D *chef's kiss*
I remember watching the livestream for this. Man it was amazing!
Vox machina reference yipepepe
I haven’t seen the full video but isn’t Luap just Paul backwards and that’s the name of the guys son and he was once human
the music in the video was an AMAZING touch i loved it!
This just makes me want to play dnd more haha
2:46 Had me immediately saying "oh my god, it's the wild sheep chase one-shot isn't it"
When I'm Shaw This Video Tunbe Nail I'm Was Thinking This Was A Dead by Daylight Video
Bro this is literally anime fantasy anime😂
That was awesome! The animation really brings it to life ❤
That was awesome.  I loved this and hope you make it a series
my first time at DnD had a dude talking about his divorced wife, my friends doing strategic moves, and my character (stalker Jim last name Jam) was hitting on a god and just being edgy
As a huge fan of both dnd and Jaiden, i knew this was going to be pretty unhinged, but damn. You guys blew away all expectations. There is nothing better than when someone super creative plays dnd for the first time. My favorite is when people come with super creative ways to use different spells. Using disguise self to lure in the baddy and then acid breathing him in the face was gold! Also something about a character with pauls backstory wielding a greataxe just really tickled my funny bone 😂
Impossible, I started playing DND a week ago and everyone started playing and talking about DND.  WHAT A WORLD?
Love how the clay fight accidentally had two Kirby references while Dedede's Royal Payback played in the background
You have inspired me to play D&D
The opening shot of Keyleth Vex Pike and Grog drinking is amazing.
Tholomew is so cute! The animation is beyond perfect!
We need more pokemon vids
I need more
I love dnd
mart of wall is hilarious
Making a DND campaign is hard as hell
Playing dnd for the first time is a wild ride. My first one shot campaign was filled with tom foolery, our campaign is mostly us trying to stop our friend who's a dragonborn to not blast the sacred tree and cursed us with constipation.
When are you going to make Digimon part 2 please I've been asking for months
I loved it
👌Mastapiece👌
I love it jaden ❤❤❤ it combines my two favorite things dnd and animation
Your character looks like susie deltarune
scaly jaiden
Im rocking with dragonborn Jaden Never saw a dragon born using hair may use it as inspiration
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I’m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.  I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to anyone.
Jaiden,i too have never played Dungeons and Dragons lol but technically u already played it so uhhhhhhh
Anyone else notice Vox Machina in the tavern at the beginning?
4:33 "Mr president" Definitely a JoJo reference from a turtle in part 5
Now we just need Tommy and Tubbo to make this even more unhinged
When i played dnd i Atemeed to throw my friend in a river
1:15   A hat tip for the Mighty Nein, or 4 I suppose
nice one shot
12:11 lol thats is an stupid goblin
9:50 The Horrifying But Really Well Crafted Cow? Horse? Costume By Ice King Simon Petrikov From Adventure Time
Slay
Love the cr reference
Pls do another I really liked this one
If anyone wants to play this adventure it is a one shot called Sheep Chase  Not kidding, while highly edited in the video, it's quite a popular one shot.
Wow, you guys play D&D very differently than I do. Sounds like a lot of fun, though!
THE STORY TELLING WAS SO GOOD (I didn't expect Ranboo and Slim Cicle to be here). Jaiden just running from her responsibilities in the first 1/3 of the video
IS PAUL JUST ALPHARAD'S LARRY!?
Dragonborn Jaiden... i absolutely LOVED it. Incredible video, I'd love to see more like this!!!
This was so good, just all of it.
"Ye old mart of wall" as someone who used to work there I'm in physical pain and I love it
WAIT WAIT I THINK I CAN SEE THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME??? 9:51  UH, i think so?? idk i cant tell but it looks so much like the staring horse that stares at them :P? that turns out to be the ice king???????? IDK im just saying :))
Like how you use king dee dee deee battle theme in the video
My childhood hero meets my favourite CCS!???!!?
Yoooo fellow dragonborn!! Im a sora a ranger
Would love more videos of DND ITS SO COOL
Sooooooo goooooooodddddr!!!!  Can’t wait for the session vid. Makes me miss my old group.   One time me (human warlock ranger) and my friend (dragon born paladin) who in game didn’t get along due to our misaligned deities, decided to have a contest while traversing a dungeon. The challenge was who could shield slide like Legolas down the upcoming staircase the furthest and and the half long rouge wanted nothing to do with this. So we both attempted the stunt and both rolled 1s. So we took catastrophic damage trying to do something stupid and had to limp our way to the boss room and though we wernt going to beat the bbe at that time we’re throughly stomped. Making our list to defeat him even stronger. lol good times.   Use this comment to share your dnd stories!! Die love to hear them.
Loved seing critical role at the begining
1:40 Larry from pokemon scarlet and violet?
Pre-liking this mf
Jaiden's emotional manipulation was the best part of the stream lmaooo
Doing more of this is now mandatory
Legend of Vox Machina / Critical role plug!!! 1:16
The alfabet gos a-z waht abut å,ä and ö
Blegh after watching the first episode of Goblin Hunter...Im never finishing that show.
I remember hearing jaiden talking about pretending to be someone’s wife and then acid blasting them point blank. Glad I remembered, very rewarding
I remember seeing the betrayal happen in Slime's stream highlights and it was glorious!
I didn't know that jaiden uses they / them pronouns. Cool
loved this so much. will mever ask for more
Oh hello Larry from Pokémon 🤣
God this thing is literally great
Dear Jaiden:  Don't draw alpharad like Larry. He's already having enough stress being an anime fan and a content creator. Don't jinx it.
You got me to subscribe with that adorable plug
YOOO so many references! First one I saw was critical role!!
oh my god that is amazing, I've been learning how to play dnd with a pretty big group and it's such a fun game
Oh she plays with lots of D, idk I saw it online
what is this oneshot dude
THATS AWESOME I CANT KJSQAGDM,GSKDJFAJFJEFD
Queer I don’t like them and I’m fine with that so stop showing up
this rocked!!!!
LOVE IT!  Neeeeeed MOOOOOOOREEEE!!! 😍
I must escape from ranboo but its too hard 😭
D&D sounds like the list unhinged acid trip…   I’M IN!
never have I ever seen a youtuber ask someone to unsubscribe
DID ANYONE ELSE SEE THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE
What class are the characters
I loved the reference of "Answer me these questions three" 😂😂😂
That was amazing, and the puns were hilarious x)
I love DND and love these vids let’s goooooo
How fun!
9:51  is horse suit ice king wears from adventure time season 2 episode 2
this video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
W new vid about to watch this
DAMN NOW I WANNA ANIMATE MY CAMPAIGN
@JaidenAnimations DID ALPHARAD DESIGN HIS CHARACTER AFTER LARRY FROM POKÉMON SCARLET & VIOLET?????
That first door was... weird 😂😂😂
Loved the Vox Machina reference in the tavern at the beginning! Great work as always!
Jaiden : Fires acid point blank Me: All i heard was IMMA FIRING MY LASER! 😂
interesting one shot.
THIS VIDEO WAS SO FUN- Jaiden and her team are so good at story telling and animation!
I laughed so hard that I started to cry, I love dnd
What a great story Jaiden! DO MORE PLEASE!!!
Absolutely gobsmacked, laughed the entire time, well done!
Give me more jaiden dnd
I love dnd also this party is amazing and compiled of my fav YouTubers slime jaiden ranboo and alpharad
So apparently Jaiden is an inhuman monster cuz that depression/disguise/acid breath was tragic 😂😂
1:48 just like how this vid is #6 on trending
please PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE 😂❤
Only 1 minuet and 40 seconds into the video and i've already been flabbergasted with how much story telling is in this video
Amazing
This was intense.
I love how they put in characters from Vox Machina😂😂😂❤❤❤
Yeah this sounds like a campaign only you guys could pull off.
Life is too short to not be silly.
yes les go play dnd
1:13 love the vox machina reference
This has SO much "WTF is going on?!" energy! 😂
Mark Thompson. GASP!
Haha the sheer chaos is so awesome and so true to adventures! ... and God damn that bongo cat is adorable...
make a dnd channel animated by you but when it is OOT (out of character) you show real life maybe
D&D is really fun, its sad that the stereotype prevents a lot from playing it. My friend joined it only because i forgotten i had d&d one time so he came with me to the session and actually really enjoyed it
Paul’s introduction sounds like he’s at an AA meeting
Love the vox machina reference
I'm the hippo. I have the strength of a hippo,  The mind of a hippo,  The power of a hippo, the IQ of a hippo, I have  the home of a king, and the power of one two. So now I am here I Shall Rule your world but I will spare you YouTuber in my rain of torment if you pin this comment
That was amazing! Vox Machina in the tavern was a nice touch :)
Jaiden PLS TEACH ME D&D idk how to play
Oh, i remember this HAHAH  Its great seein this animated bwhahaha
man i miss playing D&D
Yk it’s a good day when Jaden and James post on the same day.
OMG VOX MACHINA KAMEO😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Am I the only one who noticed the Vox Machina group?
Jacob exudes "I am so over it" energy in general, and I love that his avatar does too.
Those goblins were all fucked up 'cause they were eating Horses with Poo Brain
I need more of these. It was funny, cute and super sweet.
This was so cool! Love the CR reference! Such an awesome story and Zoot is so cool!
I need this as an animated series
jaiden furry confirmed no click bait?! (Gone wrong!?)
I played my first game last night actually with a party I found on a local discord server and it was really fun. We played for about 2.5 hours, I didn’t have a clue what was happening (due to poor internet connection and lag) but I really enjoyed it.
Jaiden's character seems to be the type to say shit like "Geneva Convention? More like Geneva Suggestion."
PLEASE MORE OF THESE
PLEASE tell me the full session is available to listen to PLEASE
The moment the EX-Wife was brought up I was like “No way she is gonna do it.”  A few seconds later  “OMG SHE’S DOING IT!
This should be a series!
Neato! I can finally use this video to convince people to play dnd!
I have never wheezed so much.  WTF.
I like your videos
#5 on trending? So deserved, this is epic.
I just watched this video and I think it is really funny, also Jaiden is so awesome!
We need an anime opening/intro for this!
This is funny that this is coming up on my fyp because Im about to play D&D for the first time ever in a few days
Jacob was just larry pokemon LMAOO
I love it when the worm said “it’s worming time” and wormed all over the place causing Zoot to scream. Truly the clay of all time.
HA i wish my stupid story has so many restrictions that you cant even do anything funny you cant throw a knife and hit a branch to hit a enemy with a pinecone or something funny but you can just stab someone its not that fun wish we did home brew
9:51 roasted ice king
Please dear god give us more, that was hysterical
D&d is awsome
just wanna say i loved seeing the Vox Machina and Fool's Gold references in the video and the tiny details in your animations are always the things that i get the biggest kick out of, much love
14:07   D E P R E S S I O N!
why is jacob just blond larry pokemon
Amazing video Jaiden! I haven't played DnD myself, but it does seem fun :D 💖
10:41 ice king horse, adventure time
your animations are always a treat, but i cant imagine how long it took to animate the mixed colored cat character. like, thats a lot more detail going on to keep consistent!👍
Why does the sheep have a British accent
Yo i played tbis campaign as a 1 shot for my friends bday, a fe wdifferences but mostly the same
How about this for a side character its a knight with a curse amulete that turns him part dragon but only the lower half... Like a centaur.  And if you defeat him you get the amulet of taur which turns your lower half into a random animals body.
4:13 silhouettes from left to right are: bat, snake, pikachu, frog, bird(one of jaiden's?), fuecoco, a reference i do not recognize, tsuchinoko, the beast
Now try Baldurs gates 3
could you make an edited version but with the other tubers voicing there DND characters
good vid even without any dungeons or dragons
Jaiden+ D&D is my happy place 😊
Charlie as DM is proboly the worst decision in the best way possible
Ayyy the critical role reference at the start
the way I went absolutely feral when I saw this pop up is concerning
As a D&D player and a forever DM myself, I see this as an absolute win.
I never played that game before so this is my first time🤩😅
i feel like D&D is something i'd only to by myself, not sharing with anyone
DOES JAIDEN REPLY???
DND ISNT A GAME! (Sorry)
11:28 o7
Are we seriously just accepting that Alpha's backstory was just Larry?
i cant even watch jaiden videos without looking like a furry now
I very like it
15:33 well... that's quite the reaction i wanted to see
14:42 because I can't stop replaying this part and need a quick link for myself. no one else can use this stamp. only me. definitely no one else who found this part funny at all. nope.
Sheep's Run is a great one-shot for a party of level 4, I recommend it to everyone
The first scene being Vox Machina made my day.
Stick with 5E, or 3.5
the shapeshifting spell was just maxed out charisma
Do more like this dude
9:13 High tier intellectual reference
9:54 YOOOOOO IT'S THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME
"Don't listen to him. He's a zebra." That'd probably convince me in a game not to listen to my teammate. 😂
I liked the video but i mostly liked this part 4:15 because it reminded me of a show called over the garden wall and it looked like the villain from the ending
That was amazingly chaotic!
We need to hear more. Please. This is the best.
This reminds me of the adventure A Wild Sheep Chase.
Tholomew's stuttering is so Ranboo lmao 😂😂. Jaiden did a really good impression.
14:42 I actuslly remember this being ssid in an older clip. Really funny to see it being the same story.
kinda like the end of pokemon platinum video
Drawing Alpharad as Larry made my entire day
Was this session streamed or posted somewhere?
This was /amazing/  Cannot wait for more
i love how your animations get better but still keep the same style and arent too over the top, this video was great it inspired me to try dnd myself
Your very first session and you’re already a murderhobo; you really are a DND player! 😂
YES!!!! FINALLY! YESS!!!!!!!!! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG AND OT FINALLY HAPPENED!!!!!!YES!!!?
Jaiden remembering the password to her account finally
I remember that in 10h u got atleast 3m view
Do more pls
This was AMAZING!!! I especially loved that the picture of the wife and child both had the mustache!
Dude they actually animated Vox Machina hell yeah!!!!!!!!
Welcome to the DND fandom
OMG I love the critical role cameo in the INN
The Peeler had me in tears!
I also just played D&D for the first time!! I was a bard and got to sing and tell stories and make people laugh 10/10 recommended
Why did Alpharad just make the Normal Type Gym Leader from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
As jaiden character embraces the manager I thought she was going to shap his neck or something, but acid blast is better.
Doing this with Ranboo and Charlie must be absolutely hilarious
I can tell when the natural 1s happened.
Isn’t paul just larry with blond hair?
i Loved when the worm monster said "it's wormin time" and then worked all over the place
1:14 I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the Vox Machina crew. Amazing reference Jaiden!
I wonder if jaiden will ever play the scarlet violet dlc
Love the adventure time reference
I like your character and the cat lol
Honestly think this would make fun anime.
not goblgob missing 2 lunges in a row man, at least he was persistent
Of all people to dm you chose charlie "slimecicle" dalgleish
3:13 that face is so cute ngl lol
Is Alpharad just Larry? If so that's hilarious
He he D&D go brrrr. In all seriousness, great video and good job. This seems like it took a long time to make.
Moremoremoremoremore
Paul looks a lot like Larry and I love that lmao
yo, why does Jaiden's character look like Susie from deltarune?
Where is the miku plush
Me trying to remember where I've heard the name Mark Thompson before: ...OH YEAH...PHASMOPHOBIA. Because that game totally doesn't just throw random basic names together lmao
EVERY CHANNEL I LOVE IS PLAYING D&D THIS IS THE BEST  Edit: I like how she threw in Vox Machina at the beginning lmaoo
I wish I had enough friends to play a session of D&D
No te entiendo ablo español ●□●
Jaiden NEEDS to guest on jrwi
also jaiden if your riding this i love your videos
Amazing
IT’S WORMIN’ TIME 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
Omg yes I love dnd go jaiden!
I LOVE D&D!
OMG hiiiii
Nice vox machina reference
This makes the time I got sedated look normal ( I was hallucinating a lot)
This is so funny! The animations make it perfect!
I've always wanted to play DnD
Man, I miss playing some D&D this was a great story/session
Alpharad as GARRY
I was holding my laugh all the way through but the "cast Depression" part just killed me. I think I saw that clip floating around awhile ago but completely forgot about it until I watched this video. She literally emotionally manipulated the main antagonist before blasting his face with acid point blank. It takes a lot to shake Charles Slmccl like that and she did it in like- 10 words or less. Girl is an actual menace to society and her social anxiety is the only thing keeping all of us safe. If she somehow picks up Charlie's extroverted energy in these prolonged DnD sessions, we are DOOMED.
i was rewatching your old videos yesterday night thinking when you'll upload again and oof, soo happy.
More dnd!!!
I will probably never understand how to play D&D but this was very entertaining to watch nonetheless
Yooooo Vox Machina reference!?!
i absolutely adore how jaidens dragon could screech like king from toh 😭 I hope that was intentional, if so adorable detail!!
Idk why but alpharad looks like Larry from pokemon scarlet and violet
That was so fun 😊
I Love the Vox Machina reference
I liked  this video.
it’s so funny that the DAY you posted this is the first time i’ve ever started making a character sheet to play with my friends :) what a coincidence
Mark’s introduction surprisingly resembles an aged up Markiplier who for one reason or another happened to lose contact with his wife and kids, supposedly because Tholomu spread FALSE rumors about him — that he CURSED him, and now no one wants to talk to him. Everyone avoids him at this point, so it makes perfect sense that he spent years becoming a dark wizard to finally get his revenge
this is was the same campain as my first one shot that I hosted as a DM :)
I LOVE THIS VIDEO PLEASE MORE! <333
I love the references to critical roll and vox machina in the background! Thanks for the Easter eggs Jaiden
omfg this is so cool, i;'ve always wanted to play D&D but never found a group to campaign with rip
Thank you Jaiden for the incredible content. My friend and I were obsessed with your channel during Covid. We rewatched every one of your videos multiple times. I love every video you’ve made. Thank you.
part 2 NOW!
WELCOME TO THE PARTY
THATS WAS AMAZING
I didn’t know I needed scaly Jaiden but that was adorable
100% stealing some of these puzzles for my own game
Lesgo🎉
The vox mochina reference made me do a double take
They rolled a lot of natural 1s in this game
I love seeing one of my favorite animators having fun with some of my favorite streamers :]
LETS GOOOOO
Just to mess with players, I'll occasionally start speaking in different/ fantasy languages (such as spanish, ittalian, asl, high imperial, and elvish/ the redawn language) Fear me as a DM -er (i have yet to learn a bunch of these so) *aggressively sighns at you while saying:* Fearing of the words of nosense of the wasing of the ising of the mouth of me of you!
hey a fellow dragonborn welcome to the D&D comunity Jaiden
Me when jaiden uploads: 🥳😆
i loved this vid!
I’m I the only one that would watch this if it was streamed?????
15:29 that emotional manipulation was not needed my gods
ME ENCANTO MUY MUY BUENO por favor subi mas cosas de este estilo
OMG MY NAME WAS MENTIONED... I don't wanna be Marks wife 😭😭
This was so good
Loving how Paul Sr is just Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet
I love that Jaiden animated her and her friends DnD adventures! I enjoyed it a lot! I hope there will be more.   Jaiden, Larry and Rambo laughing when Jaiden spitted acid onto Mark’s face. While Alpharad was just shocked 😆
Heeyyellow
hmmm.... Larry.
I remember playing dnd I forget almost everything cuz there was like 9 people and It was kinda boring the only thing i remember was my character was 11 and we just went into a bar and I asked for some beer cuz I wanted to see what would happen what I didn't expect was I would get a perfect 20 and get like a gallon of beer and this was last year btw now good by ima watch sm else this vid was really funny byyyyy  :]
Ayo!! What an awesome little reference to Vox Machina!!
MAKE MORE OF THIS!!!!
As soon as the sheep popped in I knew this adventure, I've ran it before XD
15:29 hey guys ima firing my BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAW
Omg this was so cool the art style is so cool and ranboo u did great on every single one
THIS WAS SO COOL AND FUNNY I MEAN I DIDN'T EXPECT LUAP TO BE PAUL (JR) IT'S LITERALLY IN REVERSE
Pausing the video just to scream about the VOX MACHINA REFERENCE
1:15 KEYLETH VEX GROG PIKE!!
Paul is just me
In my first campaign, I intentionally became a living nuke. In my second, I unintentionally became a nuke.
JAIDEN IS BACK
Part2? Please
Yo I saw that vox machina reference
For the past two or so years I stopped watching jaiden, but this video is fire. I say continue your adventure in dungeons and dragons.
This was very funny. Thanks for the story.
Once i Made A Bard Who Couldn’t Play Music, And Whenever I Was Told To Do Anything I Used My Stealth To Just… Run. I left my party to do anything and instead just went ahead and hunted pigs. Atleast I was able to provide people the party with bacon!
I do believe that you guys did great
PLEASE DO VIDEOS LIKE THIS AGAIN THIS WAS AMAZING AND SO FUN
CHARLIE??!?!?!
The cut-in of the actual alarmed laughter from the D&D session is SO good
I am a level 20 mage in my group I died to 1d4 air damage
Dnd timeeeeeeee
I love the parts when they clearly get a 1 or something like that
I heard soo much about it and yet I’ve never played.
I LOVE HOW THIS STORY STARTED SAJDDKJASKDJADSHJSADHJDHJASDHJASD
so im just now starting to get into dnd, and now you happen to upload a video about it too? lmao
I just realized that Alpharad's character look like Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
That's the reason why I love DnD... The funny crazy marvelous things
My sister literally always tells me about her D&D and I enjoy it although I don’t give a fluffy French f*** about Dildos and Darkens.
I love that Ranboo is a tabaxi- it's very fitting
I had the privilege of watching the vod for the d&d stream. This is a great recreation of it!
hahaha, for some reason i was expecting a kiss into acid breath blast combo for maximum weak point damage
We, the people, demand a monthly series of y'all playing D&D
ello
Am I the only one who realized that Gob Glob and Gobble were cooking the horse from that one episode of Adventure Time???
IT'S WORMING TIME
Wheres the full recording I n e e d  i t
10:03 nice subtle Adventure Time reference with the horse design!
POINT BLANK ACID BLAST TO THE FACE!
Hard to understand the door, subtitles plz
That was bat shit crazy and I want more
lol liked the legend of vox reference
THE VOX MACHINA CAMEO!!!!! I’m so happy 😁
the vox machina references made my day
Can we get this group as a spin off of Vox Machina?
One time me and my freinds went to a pub in DnD. We spanked the people in there then bought some fake lemons from next door. We then YeeTed my friend off a cliff….
That was amazing. Yeah dnd is so fun. Lol
10:03 Hold up is that the Adventure Time Horse
AIDHAIDOAD THAT'S THE BEST ENDING EVER!!!!!!!!
This is cool! doitagainlol
amazing
Hi
Jaiden was literally in that story about rizzing up a monster in a cave lmao
That was fun.
This was pretty neat!
I wonder if it was intentional that his name went from Thomas to Thompson between the beginning and end.
Oh dear, Jaiden's becoming a murder hobo. One of us, one of us! 😁
This got lore lore than a game theory video 💀💀💀
This was amazing!!! I love D&D, this was solid gold!!!
If this video doesn't make you love D&D, I'm not sure anything will.   Except maybe BG3.
That was awesome
I thought mark is going to get a happy ending but had to be plot twist 😂
What funny timing! I've just started playing my first DnD session a few weeks ago and we're having a blast at the moment. One of our member is a bear and he has a habit of eating everything. From dices, to soap and when we were in a dungeons had to keep him from eating the dead.
The amount of effort that had to go into this video, Im so impressed. It was funny and the art & story was great!
I absolutely love all of the OTGW references. Especially the Beast in the background and all the different names of Greg’s frog (edit: also the horse from that one Adventure Time episode. I’m commenting as I watch the video)
Do it was the aventure time horse
Yo this was amazingly fun to watch! :D
Love that Ranboo is a Cat in this. Jaiden choose a great race
I REMEMVER THE FUCKING TRANSFORMING INTO MARK'S WIFE FROM A CLIP DJDHIDBDHEBD
13:41 mark canonically has the sharingan
I love hearing dnd stories on how unexpected things can be
You should make this a series
I want to watch this full campaign
I love vox machina ❤
I don’t know why but I think it’s a funny the actual session happened 10 months ago during her subathon
yoh beast from over the garden wall
I liked how Alpharad was almost just Larry from pkmn scarlet and violet
nice story of a dragon. cat. and worker turning a sheep back into a human and turning a manager into a worm. 10/10
I need more
This reminds me of fear and hunger jaiden don’t look this up this will give you nightmares
MORE PLEZ
SERIES, DND SERIES NOW,  I NEED 40 MORE EPISODES
omg i know i've heard this song before but i can't for the life of me remember what it's called but can someone please tell me what the song at 8:13 is for my peace of mind please and thank you 🙏🙏🙏
The Kira Yoshikage reference 💀💀💀😭😭😭
Only part way through and I just love the Coconut Mall in the back ground! 😂
Nice
glad to see Paul animated finally
wonderful 10/10
This is so awesome, can't wait for my friends and I to finally play some DnD!
Bro the paul's intrance is just like kira itroducing himself
I NEED THE ENTIRE CALL OF THIS
I caught the Vox Machina reference at the beginning love those guys
WHERE DID THE TURTLE GO?
Has anyone noticed that whenever jadian refers to zu(her character) she either uses zu's name or they them pronouns also I love the symbol on their tongue
I DM for teens at the local youth centre....the things that have happened oh my gosh
jaiden animations and D&D is a match made in heaven and i'm surprised it hasn't happened sooner
WOW the Iuap plot twist is really nice!
slimecicle as your first DM could definitely do worst
I played Dnd once it was in my Dnd club in middle school it was fun and I haven’t play since
I love doing unhinged DND campaigns like this all the time. This video is proof that they are the best kinds of campaigns.
Welcome to the club
Omg it’s ranboo. Wow what a miracle both of my favorite YouTubers make a video together
this made me happy
This was phenomenal! Can we please get more adventures with this trio and Paul Jr. (The turtle and/or the kid)
So,Paul is Larry
I was playing DND with my friends today and my friend was a dragon to!
0:17 chip jrwi reference (not completely accurate but close enough)
Please make more of these <3
This is the most beautiful one shot I’ve ever seen, I knew immediately about the sheep and I love that one shot(too bad my rogue offed the sheep 5 min into it)
can i watch this vod somewhere??? if there even is one????
alpha decided to play larry on us💀💀💀
Dear Jaiden, I'd would like to thank you for everything you have done for the YouTube community. You have done wonderful things and are my favorite Pokémon youtuber ever keep inspiring people.  Sincerely Wyatt Basham
I would love if you did more of this!
I love DND. The campaign I Dmed ended up ending when the bard seduced god and exploded the planet.
Heh, nice Vox Machina cameo. I'm surprised you didn't chose to be one of the playable bird races.
They did a critical role reference
I'd love to see more D&D sessions on this channel!
I cant believe my luck but today was my first session DMing!
Thought this was AWESOME love all your stuff like this like the nuzloks the visual representation videos are always AWESOME only thing I’d say if u ever did it again would love to see the guys you did it with voice their characters :D
Plzzzzz post the full thing on your second channel im begging
oh god you joined the cult
Paul hits too close to home. I bet his secret technique is Facade. D:  15:20 I remember this! Never laughed so hard. Haha
Why is the animation on the riddle door so damn amazing though?
Love the music choices in the background and glad to hear some love for spirit tracks
You are so lucky that everyone you know plays DnD. I can't scrape together two players for a single session 😞
Not gonna lie I’m in the same position as jaiden all my friends play dnd but I don’t know if I’m interested or not maybe maybe not
MOOOOOOORRRRRREEEEE
OMG Jaiden that was incredible, your team did an excellent job, and we're super proud of your DM and friends for helping to give you such a fun introduction to D&D ❤
Waw i really love thia video please do more 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
One of the best stories I have ever seen😊😊😊😊😊
14:45 was a ROLLERCOASTER of emotions LMFAO
I can't believe Larry decided to quit working for Greeta and now works as Ye Olde Mart of Wall.
Jajajjajajajajajaja
I love that it's tabaxi ranboo, dragon Jaiden, and Larry from scarlet violet
You don’t know how my emotions blew up from hearing the outset island music Every new Zelda song just made my heart swell  But as a DM running a home brew campaign for over a year now as my first realtor foray into D&D, this was a delight <3
So that was... something I'm concerned about how many crit fails have been rolled for how much friendly fire there was. These dice are cursed. Tldr; that was really cool, I wrote a whole novel in that comment woops  If I were to guess everyone's builds for funsies : Jayden was a black dragonborn due to the color and acid breath, she was most likely a sorcerer, because a warlock would of ran out of spell slots and sorcerers start with daggers (such as the ones that were thrown into the ceiling's eye) also the magic thingy on her character's tongue which could be draconic bloodline and I don't think they were a wizard, as they used a lvl 2 spell which wizards do not have at level 1 unlike sorcerers  The cat was obviously a bard, I don't recall if bards start with their college already chosen at level 1.   Cat means tabaxi, however, tabaxi are typically taller than humans, that would probably mean that either they used tasha's cauldron of everything's rule of "if it sounds cool and your dm agrees then screw the predefined archetypes" which would allow for a small tabaxi (that or they were flavoured as being short with no actual impact on the rules)   Meanwhile, Paul was a human barbarian due to the great axe. If not, they were a fighter, which would be hilarious, as Larry the normal type gym leader everyday man who works 9 to 5 would absolutely be the everyday human fighter.  The DM was really good at rolling with the chaos, like that must of been quite a puzzle to figure out how to deal with groundhog day cat and M&L bros attacks. That story was absolutely bonkers and somehow had backstory payoffs for the entire party, which is really cool. Did not see the sheep twist coming even though it was kind of hiding in plain sight.
I have to comment on Charlie's sheer genius as a DM, I absolutely love their changes to the great sheep adventure, which also happened to by MY very first D&D game as well!!  Making it a three party transmutation based dungeon was so cool!!!
This Dungeon master is extremely good at making a dnd campaign
Bro was that the horse in adventure time bein cooked by the goblins
I for sure thought jaiden was gonna be an aarakocra or something
Lol Glad to see you played DnD!    My All Time Favorite Character that I'm still playing as is a Tabaxi Life Domain Cleric named Zarba Rook!
That was indeed, awesome. Now do it again.  That is an order by Youtube. You can't disobey.
DunJaidens and Dragons
It’s was Wholesome until Jaiden blasted Him.  If Jaiden go for the Kiss, this would be a NFT Problem.
Does anyone notice how Ranboo is basically Bango Cat the Meme
This is an absolute lunatic fever dream. I want a whole season.
Looks like Vox Machina has got some competition. lol I loved this and I hope you animate more of your DnD sessions.
13:39 was that an Obito reference??
This is the funniest Jaiden animation video I have seen in a while nice job Jaiden keep up the good work
the vox machina reference!!!!!! love it!!!!!
This was so cool!!
jaidennnnnn this was so freakin cool <3 loved this vid sooooo much
I loved this so much!!!! Please do more of this!!!!
Bro tried to charizzma us😂
1:15 I Love the CR reference here ❣
10:04, anyone think the dead animal looks like the horse from the adventure time episode “The Eyes” or is that just me. Great video btw :D
i didnt think you could top your nuzlock series. but MAN i hope we get more of these!!!! ive always wanted to play dnd but i dont have anyone that would be willing to play, and idk how to even start.
Hehe nice
I LOVED THIS! This is the crossover we needed JaidenxD&D
I really want to watch the actual d&d session where can i watch
*Oh god Jaiden posted, what chaos is in here for me*
Glad to se the deusmacina from prime making an appearance loved that show
As someone that has never played d and d , this is interesting
I saw that sneaky CR reference
On this day I unsubscribed…………………………………………………………………………………………………………             Jk
Loved it ❤
Walmart guy from the cash register lol
Why is alpha the best gym leader Larry
Love The Beast thrown in the woods there
I've been playing D&D the past few years and have been having a blast! Glad you enjoyed it! Though I am wondering why Luop didn't reveal who he was before being turned back...
i love alpharad as larry so much bc his chat always roots for larry when they see him so they have to root for jacob now
The music at 14:25...that sounds so familiar. Where is that from?
Omg it's A Wild Sheep Chase!!!! I love this one shot. It's such a fun one for new players. Our sheep ruined a birthday party when I ran this . Lol! It's free online, everyone should give it a go.
D&D is amazing.
THE BACKGROUND CHARACTERS ARE VOX MACHINA That’s awesome
I LOVED THIS SM
I hope y’all recorded this, I want this as a side series on just roll with it
This was awesome!!!! It's always great seeing new players do stuff in D&D, they're always so much more creative. Would love to see more of these from you!
10:04 You had to place Ice king in the fire
did you just pull the same move as envy from fma brotherhood?💀💀💀
I liked the part at 8:23 when the worm said “It’s wormin time” then wormed all over the place
Man, I did NOT see the final twist coming and was taken back by how sweet it was after witnessing Zoot ACID BLAST Mark POINT BLANK after giving him depression and disguising themselves as his wife klsdjhfkl
alec wake up jaiden posted
I LOVE THIS VID
I am in 2 campaigns! And YOU WATCH OVER THE GARDEN WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My friend is insisting that I say that dragonborns don't have tails ":3" another friend
12:09 SOMEBODY GET THIS MAN SOME GLASSES
Play mega man pls
I am so happy right now.
Anybody else catch themselves bobbing their head along with the support team at the end? or is that just me?
Jacob is just Larry from Pokémon
When I got into D&D, my first character was a Druid. I am never allowed to play a Druid ever again. Apparently allowing a dragon to swallow you and saying, "I want to use Wild Shape." Now imagine a Polar Bear giving a dragon the worst case of terminally fatal heartburn imaginable. Our DM... yeah, murder-hoboing a red dragon from the inside broke him and made us all crave those Klondike bar things because... bear. Funtimes.
Nice
15:30 hehe. I get that
Iconic first D&D experience.
Did you guys let Alpharad cheat at this game too? Or did he play a game straight up for once
THIS WAS AWESOME!!!
wow this animation is truly stunning. i would absolutely love to see more dnd animations sometime in the future !
Jaiden as dragonborn, alpharad as human, and of course ranbo choose tabaxi  Also you know you've won when you manage to make the god to facepalm themself.
You realize we need more right? You know what you've done Jaden. You've given us our fix... And we need M O R E
This is amazing :)
Jaiden, Alpharad, and Ranboo playing a DnD campaign with Charlie as DM. Never in my life I thought I would see the day that such a power party came into existence. I can already tell this is going to be one HELLUVA campaign.
I thought I recalled the "I turned into the big bad's ex-wife and acid-ed him in the face" story somewhere XD
jaidens dnd character is so hilarious and absolutely unhinged to the core i love it  14:07 is iconic imo
It was glorious!
From what I know of Charlie I would not like him to be the dm
I’m surprised you weren’t playing an aaracokra or a kenku!
Dude, i remember seeing clips of Jaidens bit with turning into marks wife, it was amazing! I laughed so hard when it first came out and i loved how out of left field it was haha
I remember watching this when it was live! This session was great!
SLMCCL?
The villain reveal was hilarious.
Jaiden i wish u would be a bird
I love dnd and i'm so glad you enjoyed your first session with it. are you going to keep playing or was it just a one off?
Welcome to the chaos that D&D players know oh so well.
OMG you guys should play Baldur's Gate 3.
Im so deeply upset that my brain farting out "zebra" for the forst riddle was actually correct --
I see that you're a fellow based Dragonborn enjoyer, as well. Very cool. I'm unsubscribing so I can subscribe again.
Plz make this a series
8:23 i liked the part where the worm said "its worming time" and proceeded to worm all over the place. it was truly one of the worm moments of all time.
Do MORE!!!!
DaD is such a cool concept and game. I did play it a couple of times with friends but we never finished the campaign, hopefully someday I can start and finish one.
I love this shit, ngl I would love to watch Jaiden play dnd with Charlie, Jacob and Rambo
pls make more of these omg
Me and my party once tried saving this one person- We absolutely yeeted them into a rock wall made of real rock they ended up being the Mayor lol
I saw vox machina in the vid and freaked out
PLEASE MAKE THIS A SERIES
Thank you for the Vox Machina reference. Big preesh 🫶  Seriously tho this could be a mini-series and I’d love to see more!
Does anyone else see the adventure time horse
DAMN IT now i want to see her reaction/play through of baldurs gate 3
Did Alpharad intentionally make Larry from Pokémon?
Amazing video
You should make more of these!! This was so funny!
YOOOOOOOOO ITS DND
I wish i had friends to play dnd
nerd
Yo can someone despell my depression
I would love for this to be an anime, also Paul is the BEST character hands down!! 💯🔥
I love how one of them is literally just bongo cat
Alpharad just being Larry is just *Chef’s Kiss* 👌
Yes. Just yes
That sounded a lot like a wild sheep chase (Great starter campaign cause it's pretty short) but i liked the changes (assuming it was actually was a wild sheep chase)
Oh my god this was fantastic. I need to try playing table top at least once
In my d&d campaign i also had a sheep conpanion
I think we need more of this tbh
I would love to see another DnD session!!! It was so much fun to watch the streams and now the comic version!!
More dnd! Epic!
3:25 HAS ME ROLLLLLING LMFAO JAIDEN THIS IS MY FAV VIDEO U HAVE DONE IN A WHILE. this makes me wanna play dnd 4 the first time so bad
YEESSSSS
These Wal-Mart jokes are so stupid! I love it! 🤣
Angry blond man, weird heavyweight dragon, and an adorable bongo cat, the world’s best team.
This video  released right as our dnd session was set to start.
My kiddo loves your videos! Excited to see you having fun with tabletop games.
WE. NEED. MORE. ADVENTURE. AND. VIDEO!
I should try it once
10/10 ❤
=]
Haha😂😂😂
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
Dude this was SO GOOOOOOOOD!!! Love these kind of videos :)))
Ranboo’s little kitty has such tiny little guy energy
I can't handle the door I can hear it so exactly in Charlie's voice, I know the effect he would use, the voice, the tone, the moments where he laughs at his own insanity to immediately, not even half a chuckle in, re-enter character. It's too much it's such a charlie bit everyone is somehow to perfectly shining through their character and I love it so much this little team of buffoons is my favorite thing
Loved loved loved this. Thank you.
JAIDEN AND RANBOO!! THE COLAB WE NEEDED!!
Getting a lot of Pajama Sam vibes from this video 😄 With the tree house and the doors
54 seconds in and i know its going to be chaos with slimecicle as the DM
Shocking Non of the goblins is named "Deez"
The turtle must have been named Poul-Nareff.
imagine alpharad, ranbboo and slimecicle voicing there too, would be a dream
Fun dnd story. I decided to use a epic npc man skit in my session as a joke. The party had to choose between this random npc killing his mother, or selling his son. Without hesitation the party chose sell the son and one of the players actually bought the child. That player wanted to use their backup charecter so later that session I had them murdered in a dark ally. The kid he bought swore to find his killer and trained under the cleric to be a paladin, he was the clerics familer in everything but name lol
This was AMAZING! I would love to play more DnD
Loved it
You know what? I bought the sub plug in the first 40 seconds. :D   I subscribed.
You literally transformed into his ex-wife and then acid-basted him in the face, Genius like this does not write itself, I almost died laughing
Who else can see every time someone failed a role?
The adventure time reference was delightful.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!! I've been watching Jaiden since before I got into D&D, so the fact both of them intersected is like a dream!. I was so stoked when the original session came out, I was so happy to hear that Jaiden had fun!! I remember watching the session and hoping it could one day be a video, this is like a wish come true!!
I hope you guys can do more of this I really love this stuff and when i saw this video i was super excited
Jaiden i LOVE D&D and im happy you made a video about it
Please Please PLEASE pull a Dingo Doodles and make this a full series!!!
You've inspired me to become an animator 😄
Big fan of Godcicle
I would have kicked peeler right off of it
this was a great vid!
I was not prepared to see Ranboo in the thumbnail
Okay, but... what abou Paul Jr., the turtle?! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TURTLE?
Played a game of dnd tonight...   My character LOVES sickles so when he got some he was so overjoyed that he started dancing the macarena.  Random dude in background dancing the macarena distracts guard just long enough for rest of party to escape and hide. Macarena saves the day.
... Dungeons & Dragons has fucking _mace??_
would love to hear about your next adventure!
the critical role references!!
Do this again i love this
This is amazing, I can't wait for more
YES I LITERALLY PLAYED TODAY
I'm trying to figure out how to make a joke about mace proficiency, but...  I'm just stumped.  Also, literally everything about the door scene made me laugh maniacally.
is there somewhere i can watch the actual thing with like ranboo slimecicle and alpharad
Beautifully made as always, Jaiden 😄
Mesa wantsa more
....*scribbles down the plotline of this campaign to use*
*Standing Ovation*  10/10. I would definitely enjoy more DnD sessions. This was fantastic.
1:15 vox machina
MORE PLZ
Fantastic, love the dnd episode! Would love to see more adventures!
You guys did well and Just Rolled With It. I’m proud.
This was cute and funny! It sounds like a fun time! ❤
WAHT ABOUT THE TIME LOOP THING THAT JUST NEVER GOT RESOLVED
Such wasted potential
That was awesome dude. Fricc yeah. Hope you guys do it regularly, not only is it quite the game it’s also a really chill way to flew the creative muscle. Awesome stuff ❤
This reminds me of my second campaign of D&D.
this looked fucking epic.
DUDE YOU GATTA DO MORE PLEASE
DnD in a nutshell 😂
jaiden I love your videos, I love your content, I found out about your videos through fandubs, I like when you talk about pokemon, and now about d&d, you are incredible,
Fantastic video! Alway happy to hear about someone getting started with DND. Hope you can have another session and have another video like this!
Damn just damn
You guys need a better d20.  You seem to roll an absurd number of rolls of 1.
This is pretty good  Mark pulls out pic of wife  Oh no...
THAT WAS SO FUN!!!!
9:51 IS THAT THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME?
An iconic meme at 9:12
I literally just got done with a D&D game when this came up in my suggestions.
Honestly, the fact that slimeSicle was like this mischievous god who influenced the things around the party by appearing and rolling dice. That was pretty fun. Also, he got his own get up I would like to suggest some art of one of the other three would’ve looked like as DMs
If you haven't played Baldurs Gate 3. Give it a Shot! You won't regret it!
What is the emdcard music at the end it sounds cool.
I loved this video you should make more but the voices of the people you played with!
Yes Dnd I love it
paul carried🔥🔥
The aventure time horse in 9:53 hahahah
Woww Ive never played Dnd and it looks fun, but i gotta say is it just me or the animation looks a bit off? No hate tho Love Jaidenn❤
As a fan of D&D, this was so fantastic to watch and it’s so cool to see this kind of stuff animated and I love it 💜
Power word depression is hilarious
I saw a different video of them doing this and I was wondering if they would do the acid blast thing. Creative.
Paul is just blond Larry, lol
Not the acid spit right in his face while being disguise is his ex wife that’s crazy
1:16 Love the Vox Machina reference. It didn’t go unnoticed.
Paul looking like Larry?
dragonborn Jaiden is something I need more of in my life. Side note, I played a couple of VERY simple oneshots a while back. Although, I would like to be part of a serious campaign one day. Glad to hear you had fun!
I mean dnd
i love dnd, welcome to this wonderful world
I love and;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bruh this is just a "Would you still love me if i'm still a worm" but DND?!!
deltarune ass party
4:16 this reminds me of my first campaign, i was a 7ft tall snow white dragonborn wizard named starkeeper, the day couldnt make it, one of my party members (also a wizard) tryed to cast ray of frost, but miss spoke and cast "ray of frog instead, so the next time i was there he tryed to cast the same "ray of frog" spell but he only wanted to sommon 1 building sized one, he rolled a 3, he casted the frog and it was the size of a basketball, a second later it was eaten by an aligator, once we killed it i ripped out some of the gators teeth and cut open a hole in the gators stomach to retrieve the frog, than I glued the gator teeth to the frog as if they were spikes, thus, starkeepers frog "Bartholomew" was born, and Bartholomew is still in my inventory today!
I have never thought to use command to give people depression, good idea jaden :)
This is my favorite video so far.
give us more of these adventures. This is amazing
Who else thinks Paul looks like Draco malfoy?
Depression is both the most brilliant and most horrific use of a command spell that I've ever heard of. Mad respect. Also, I was literally chanting "Use acid breath" over and over during the touching scene with the boss (err, manager. XP ), and I was so happy when you did it. I wonder if I should question what that says about me as a person... Nah! XD Thanks so much for the awesome video! :D
I really enjoyed this. Please do more D&D content in the future!
I really need to find a D&D group... after finding time for it to begin with
Can you do that again
Got married today, but still making time for you jaiden
I love how Command was used to cast depression
Let’s gooooooo Jaiden animations with the Dragon born I was very excited when I saw her choose a dragon born because that was my first character I choose Dragon born
Why is it, everyone who can use a disguise goes for a loved one just to backstab the poor guy?
I am now obsessed with the designs of Zoot and Tholomue. I need MORE.
GASP VOX MACHINA REF
DEPRESSION!
That was awesome!
Paul actually being Larry is literally perfect
I’m dying to play DND please invite me next time I’d be down to clown
This makes me want to play D&D so bad, but none of my friends have any idea what it is help
Holy shit my name is paul
I remember friends telling me about DND and I thought to myself "I'll either not really care for this or enjoy it so much that it consumes way too much of my free time."  Soooooo it turned out to be that second one...
ranboo not ronboo
4:34 Jojo reference
14:07  Ḑ̸̟̚͠e̵͕͋̀p̵͓͌͜ŗ̴̅͆ę̴̗͒̃ṣ̶̰͗s̶͙̈́ͅi̷̫͂͊ǫ̴̫͐͝n̶̙̎͐!
this was fantastic and i'm so glad you had fun :)
THE CHATOIC ENERGY IS WILD IM DYING
I am all for more D&D adventures! So awesome!
This was fantastic!!! I would love to see more animated DnD Adventures!!!!
This is amazing! Can't wait for a second sess
throughout this, there are quite a few lines that i can 1000% hear charlie saying
Paul is a god 😂
DND is an awesome game, and i really love it as well. Hope you enjoyed playing it as much as i do
Once,I was fighting a red dragon and my character threw an apple at the dragons eye. Nat 20,the dragon was killed. By an apple. It was a fun session
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FINALLY!!!!
THIS NEEDS TO BE A SERIES. I would watch this, all the episodes, every single one my gosh.
Last time I played DND I was carrying around a dead body
Can’t wait for more dnd stuff
THAT.WAS.AWESOME! NEED MORE
THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE LMAO
The best plotwist ever was Luap being revealed as Paul jr
Omg was that Vox Machina
Me at 15:27: aww! Also me at 15:28: … 😂
Vox Machina party on one the tables was so cute
Amazing animation as always Jaiden and team!! <3 <3
YES! SHE FINALLY HAS A DND STORY!!! Dude I love dnd, and out of all things you play a DRAGONBORN?! My favorite race!!! And mine was named Zooks! Similar
Oh, a sheep ram-page.
Lol the Mario&Luigi music fits so well
I like the part where the worm said "ITS WORMIN TIME" got to be one of the greatest anime movies of all time
What a Jacob moment
I loved this:D<3
Rip mark thompson becoming a worm and got fired 🪦
i fought death naked and won. it was a thing called the deck of many things and i pulled 3 cards one was change your fate, another the lose all your stuff card, and the death card and i decided to fight death and won barely. that was my first time playing d&d and i thought it was fun
that cougar scarejump really got me :(
THAT ENDING WAS SUCH A BANGER AND THE MUSIC WAS SO CATCHY I LOVED THIS
D&D sometime just feel like a fever dream that you can controlled but on a much bigger scales
Ur so lucky jaiden. I have a hard time finding friends into the same things as me (like D&D)
oh cool
OoOoOoOoooooOooOoooo
i am planning a D&D adventure with my friend's group
I was not expecting to hear Charlie and Ranboo’s actual laughs in the vid! It caught me off guard, but in a good way
My D and D game started with the gods fighting for control of the universe.
Why don't you bring guest voice actors for this? That looks GOOD!
Jaiden, your storytelling skills are so impressive that even my pet hamster can't resist watching your videos with me! 🐹📺
DEAR GOD NO 16:26
Cool guys don't look at explosions.   they blow sh*t up, and then walk away.
and then they were acid blaseted
It was funny and great and Jaiden is so awesome!
BROO IM ONLY A MINUTE IN BUT I CAN TELL THIS IS GONNA BE AN AMAZING VID :D dnd is sm fun in my last session i just punched the sht outta everything
Is the cat still stuck in a time loop since the wands magic is all out?
They... They ate the clay
My players befriended a lich just today. We are running Dungeon of the Mad Mage right now. (The lich was Ezzat.)
Dude that acid blast point blank was absolutely disrespectful She had him in depression making him think shes his ex wife then proceeded to melt this mans face
I LOVED IT  😂
That was amazing, however I could have sworn I have seen the acid blast at point blank disguised as a loved one before, either a similar creator or im seeing into the future agian.
Awesome video
Yes first James now Jaden
Was that the horse from adventure time??
not the furry ranboo
🥲This *snif* is a masterpiece. (coming from the perspective of a D&D player.)
If I wasn't already subbed, I would have. 😊
Was that the ice king horse
So um, what happened to the turtle after you threw him at the door?
Yoooo
Ah yes the best trio, a furry, a scale-y, and a pokemon gym leader
It was great you guys should do it again
Shout out to Vox Machina!!
FINALLY A NEW VIDEO
Ahhhh I love this video 😂❤
VOX MACHINA LET"S GOOOO
Glorious.  Absolutely glorious.  A tale for the taverns that the bards shall sing for ages!
I just want to say- Thank you for the idea of "command depression" it made a really funny moment and we got a dragon friend out of it
oooo?
This one time one of my party members resurrected a fish bone into a *zombie fish* with insane speed. Somehow, I managed to kill it by throwing my spear at it. After this, our Dungeon Master now threatens us with making us fight a school of undead fish.
i loved this as i play dnd
"Would you still let me be your manager even if i was your..." *turns into a worm*    I see what you did there 😂
Luap 😢
Woke up to this video, best morning ever
Pls do more I love d and d and this video was super funny pls do part 2
Moreeeeee🤣🤣🤣
No lies,It’s adorable that Ranboo became a cat
TYYYEESSSSSSSSSS. FRFIJNNNNANAAAALLLLLLLYYY WOOOOOOOOOOO THANNNKLKKKM YOOOOOIUUUUUUUUUUUU
Wait is Alpharad trying to be Larry. Because thats sick
What the heck is ur class I already can tell ranboo is a bard U didn’t mention this in ur video
I like how the story has adventure time references
Just 2 days ago I played my first session on dnd and we happened to play a session very similar to this, it was a very fun experience can't wait to do it again!
ITS WORMIN' TIME!!!
JAIDEEEENN I'm sooo happy that your posting again!! 🎉  missed watching your videos so much😅.
this is so awesome
i liked when the worm was all like "it's worming time" and wormed all over them
D&D is great! 😂❤
This is freaking amazing!
9:51 THATS FROM ADVENTURE TIME
And then after all that, the day resets again
This video was awesome
That ending was great...
I'm just very proud of myself that I got the zebra answer right. also the sheep's human silhouette
THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE WOOH
alpharad turned into larry. what a sight
I’m a simple person, I see jaiden, I click
The name Zoot is just incredibly cute, tbh
Not the adventure time cow🥲
Love that vox machina reference
Appreciate the extensive use of Superstar Saga ost here thanks
I love the little pokemon ranger music cameo
0:35 It was so smooth until she panicked. 😂😂😂
I agree with the fact that this is Unhinged. It is the funniest dnd session I have ever watched
THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE OMG
DM: “Alright, work out backstories for your characters.”  Me: “Just a thrill seeker mostly. Merc by trade, I’ll take the cash, but my character’s just here for the fun as much as I am.”  AlphaRad: “My kid left me and my life is stagnant.”  Ranboo: “So I’ve been trapped in a time loop for three years.”
The power of depression
Larry explaining his life like yoshikage kira killed me
Oh hello there Jaiden join-to-become-a-member button. How long have you been there?
Does Jaiden’s dragon look a bit like Susie from Deltarune to anyone else?
This video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
I love that jacob is just larry
15:28 How did I know that was coming? XD
MOOOOOOOOOOAR
Aww that's a nice Vox Machina reference there.
Haven't dealt with depression? Mark back story is depressing
To bad the timeloop is still going lmao
I want to have a metle pipe explode.
I love this!!!
Ahh, the game we’re jocks use to make fun of nerds back in highschool.
Ranboooo!? Charlie!? I luv this colabbbb!
If the campaign keeps going on, i really hope you make more videos about these lil guys!
This is awesome:)
9:53 Adventure Time horse!!!
Yoooo badassss
This was so fun to watch! 😂
I absolutely LOVED this, what a BEAUTIFULLY UNHINGED session. Its the best kind
1:13 the Vex Machina reference is legendary holy
The animating was insane for this one
Paul looks oddly like Larry...
Jaiden the asexual, is a part dragon.... :D this is truly amazing
I have always loved your videos and D&D stories, so obviously this now my favorite video of all time! This video was amazing, keep up the good work!
Why does Aphalrad looks like Nanami from Jujutsu kaisen? 😅🤣
skyWARDSWORDMUSICHGSDKLHJSJKHBSHB
As a fellow black dragonborn, point-blank acid breath has been the entire goal of my character and it brings me great joy to see you do what I have failed to accomplish (fell on my face twice in one session trying)
I joined a party with a group of friends around 2 months ago and I've been having so much fun! My character is a Tabaxi named Merry Dream (Merry for short) and she is mostly just kinda "there" in the party. Since I'm fairly new and don't know how to comprehend being creative sometimes (mainly coming up with things on the spot), I haven't made a whole lot of game-changing decisions, but I will surely have more and more fun the more I play D&D!
I LOST MY MIND AT THE WIFE SCENE IM SORRY THAT WAS HILARIOUS
Larry and Bongo Cat are top tier character inspo choices
Bru
First time playing my party just blew up
0:18 Ok this is the most random story I have ever heard from a dude that playd D&D
:D
TURTLE FINAL ANSWER! -proof Jaiden is great for DnD
I loved this!!!
4:53 ya got me. Whoever made this character, true genius 🎉
That was just straight up Vox Machina
What about the time loop though?? What happend to the cat boy?
If you're wondering where the other three boys from the Super High Intensity Team are, they're still navigating the door.
OMG i love this so much can you do another maybe in your next video i love the  D&D game and storytelling please do more
Bruh if you do LIKE DnD then…I’m sorry that was my first time doing that lmao Jaiden has been hanging out with Alpharad for WAY TOO long lmao
I also recently started dnd I'm mortis a dragon born cleric we have axol our barbarian orc atremis the changeling rouge and the lonley wizard and anxiety mage we start off in a bar axol and artremis are drinking as the mage is screeching I walk up to the bar tender and ask for fireball he looks confused so u repeat myself this time he pours ale on my cloak so I ice breath this guy to the wall then a bar fight breaks put axol tries to leave then some ruffians block them then axol swings there great axe into one of there sides and pull it out then I walk up to the ruffians and say move or I'm going to kill one of them said we would but your friend just killed our friend so no you can't leave so i take my sickle and cut the guys head off as we exit all the people in the bar chase after us so me and axol stay back and the others run up a tree so I use my breath effect got a 19 on it and killed them all but two people i drink some rum throw the bottle at one of the last people killing them the last guy chases the Wizard up the tree so he jumps down and stabs the dude repeatedly in the same spot until axol breaks his neck then the others get escorted to meet with a guy named straud now while i got the drink i also got a letter from straud dunno what it says so the party goes to Bolivia to meet with Straud they go to bed and get jumped by undead vamp who are against us and straud one of them literally bites the mages butt and the mage levitates them that all happened in one session
Poggies
Oh yeah, just the opening “pre-D&D Jaiden” I feel. I mean, I have played D&D before, I know I like it, I just don’t pursue it as much as I should. I want to play it more than the little I have, but without a close friend group, it feels like more of a commitment for me to look into that. And online D&D (which I’m also considering) instead has the problem of living with family and no soundproofing.
ranboo gives me chopper from one piece vibes
OKAY BUT IS RANBOO STILL STUCK IN A TIME LOOP
Bro I commented on her VODS and a year later this video pops up...
i literally played my first dnd game yesterday lol
I once helped a giff (gun hippo from space) commit various war crimes on a small peaceful cave of chibby mindflares.
I love how same hat everyone gets when dnd comes along and you pick the dragon option. Everyone else is like "WHY?" and you're like "its the right option"  You're playing a fantasy game where you can be anything and you choose human or elf, you rolled a nat 1 in your mind, bud. Everyone here picked solid options 20/10  Also Paul transcends mundanity with a flawless backstory, don't ask questions lol
This was great!!! Dnd is incredible and I’m so so so glad you had fun!!! The animations for the different spells and creativity with that was top notch.
So this game is just “use your imagination”? Idk if I’m getting it can someone explain it to me?
9:32 haha Charlie bagoogoo.
That was very nice. I love DnD so much. Glad you were able to play
Glad youre getting in to dnd :]  Wild sheep chase is quite a fun campaign haha
The Easter egg basically was the character named Hunter. He had a smaller scar in season two then he had in season three this is that same show the owl House.
I wanna see more! This was amazing.
Video starts... LOZ music starts playing... Hell yes.
Luap is Paul Alucard
jacob reminds me of sanji from one piece
LOVED THIS!! THANK YOU!!
Love that Mark is wearing a walmart employee vest.
9:30
1:16 Vox Machima ksksks
That was AMAZING, I would like to see more
WHAT HAPPENED TO PAUL JR (the turtle)
This video is so cool!! I love the story line!! Its so cool!!
so earlier today, i was playing a bard in a oneshot, and this goblin was begging me for mercy after i slashed his back with a rapier, so i cast vicious mockery. I said “You pathetic loser, can’t even stand and fight, what a JOKE” and i dealt 3 physic damage, the goblin had 3 health. It jumped off a cliff and killed itself.
Amazin
Do another one
So, I don't know if you have it uploaded somewhere or if one of the other three do. But I would love to watch the VoD of you playing DnD cause I remember seeing clips of it!
You def drew this while you played to make the game better...
Ranboo reminds me of Avocado.
I never plaid d and d, but my friends said they launched a boat up a mountain to save a monk.
Comand "Depression" is such a powerful and ultimately sinister use of it I was not expecting.
Legend of Vox Machina is the best we need season 3
From the intro I thought we were about to play my favorite D&D one-shot "The Wild Sheep Chase", but oh boy was I wrong
Ranboo is cute small 5’11 ft furry. ^^
How short I'm erlier than before (I have bad gammerr)
One of my favorite creators, mixed with DND :0 this is amazing. I love this sm!
Have been waiting for a new video in so long. Worth !
Oh yeah regarding that ogre story in the beginning bards are crazy my friends and I use a rule (idk if it's made up) where we can subclass every 4 level my friend is a black chameleon race guy who slowly changes to white named Michael Jackson and he's a bard and he keeps choosing bard as his subclass he can guarantee suducing anything so he suduce both the planet earth and a castle
i havent watched jaiden in years, i saw ranboo and immediatly clicked lol.
Never been interested in D&D but this got my attention 😮
Me and my friends have been playing dnd and its been so fun its great how universally loved this game is
Never underestimate the power of a human fighter Alpharad knows this
Hey this actually looks like a great session! Also Alpharad being Larry 🤣
lol the adventure time horse
im always ready for some D&D
i love how alpharad is just straight up larry
9:50 That horse looks suspiciously familiar.... 🤔🤔🤔🤓🤓🤓
that was amazing yall should maybe do a dnd live that would be cool to see. love your videos jaiden!
I love how you could feel the exact moment people rolled 1's without someone calling out "OH MAH GAWD IT'S A ONE!"
This is going to sound like a coincidence, but I actually played d&d during the time this was posted, as a talking cat character.
I love how Paul is just basically Larry 🤣
That is so cool in my first D&D game I took two bonus 🦴🦴 of the attack
9:52 Was that the horse costume from adventure time?
This was from Jaidens subathon I remember watching this live ❤
I saw Ranboo in the title and I’ve never clicked faster on a video
Im really just surprised she didn't go with an arracocra
Hey Hey! a Odd1sout and Jaiden animations videos on the same day! we've hit the fortune!
I love how alpharad’s character looks like Larry
I liked when the worm said "its wormin time" and then wormed all over the party
Odd1sout and jaiden posting on the same day😊
Omg that was hilarious especially when jaiden's character acid blasts a emotional mark straight in the face also jaiden I play as a dragonborn in the campaign I do with my parents and sister
I love DnD so much, and it’s so fun to see someone jump in. When I was new, it was so amazing and I love seeing others enjoy it too. The barrier to entry is there, but it’s definitely worth it all
One of us, one of us. the D&D club love that you played a Dragonborn     That's my Main option for my D&D race
Jaidens crew making an animation about dnd is like a dream come true
"Don't listen to him, he's a Zebra" now that's a shirt I'd want to see in the wild
10/10 so cool
I just did my first dnd on Friday
In my first D&D campaign my friend cast enlarge on my already large, mountain of a man to which I ripped the roof off of the blacksmiths hut while my friend sat on my shoulder. We then proceeded to rob him while he was absolutely flabbergasted. We were then asked to pay for the damages by the towns hall/city council to which I rolled a nat 20 on intimidate.  This all started because I wanted free swords.
Yes the depression spell! I remember seeing the short for it , and it's so much more hilarious seeing the full scene of that spell. Nice play there Jaiden!
what is the end lol
This is wonderful
The foreshadowing
Vox Machina!?! xD lol
I lovee your videos watching them at work! Keep doing a amazing job!
Oh my god slime and the cat fucking losing it and about to die after jaiden just goes full sociopath on the bad guy is fucking priceless!
Dude when the worm actually said “it’s wormin time” I lost it 😂
We need the LIVE VERSION IF THIS NOW ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Hell yeah dragonborns.
That looked like a really fun oneshot! My dnd group is currently finishing the first part of the dragon of icespire peak campaign. We compose of a Fighter Dragonborn with no flight response, a Wizard Satyr who endangers the party more often than not, a Ranger Shifter who is struggling with two different forms of lycanthropy, and a Bard Changeling (me) who was experimented on and has lost control over their transformation powers.
Amazing!
Don't contact me back
I LOVE IT!
9:50 is that the horse from that one episode of Adventure Time?
paul is so dilf
If I had a dollar for every adventure I'd seen that started with a polymorphed sheep giving the players a scroll of speak with animals, I'd have 2 dollars. Which isn't a lot, etc etc
So epic! I hope you’ll show more! 😂👏🏽💜
Jayden I'm not even open the video I'm so excited I'll love dingy from the 1st day I'll see to dude I die keep playing this game
Love that Vox Machina reference
The dm listens to the dark dice podcast I bet.
If this isnt the most dnd ass montage of an adventure idk what is XDXD
we all know that the door script was taken 100% without editing from Slimecicle's part
I rull 20 to date the Dragon
.
i love paul sm he's such a mood- i love how the other two went crazy with high fantasy characters and oo cool magic and then pauls just corporate slave- its beautiful how his only emotion is just dissapointment 4:11 that transition was epic 12:22 kitty cat attack  ZOOT JUST SHOUTING "DEPRESSION' AND IT *WORKING*  IS SENDING ME I CANT FUCMI BREATHE the way i was actually getting emotional over mark seeing his wife again and being all sad and then JUST ACID BLAST POINT BLANK CAUGHT ME SO OFF GUARD- charlie and ranboos reactions were me fr but JACOB IN THE BG the line "Looks like the manager position just opened up" is gold and the lil "youre fired" "would you still let me be your manager even if i was a.." WORM-  LUAP BEING PAUL OH MY GOD jaiden and ranboo just noticing the word play was so real-   the character designs and storytelling are absolute gold its so well done (especially love zoot having a lil rune on the tongue-) and slimecicle's dm design looks epic and the music is so good!!! i love this entire video
is there a vod of this?
Man I really want to fricking play this game
paul was a human jaden was a draonborn but i forgot which type and ranboo was a tabaxi
Alpharad really did the "kira yoshikage" move in the beginning.
Alright, now I need to try D&D for realz.
Alpharad’s character just being fantasy Larry was great
Absolutely loved ranboos character, and I think I loved zoot (?) Acid blasting mark Thomson in the face while still being his ex wife even more.
So...... part two?
More about you because if you don’t know, this TV show, probably just unintentional
That Kirby Airride music gave me so much nostalgia
I love when jaiden said "Ronbuu"
Loved it great stuff  . D&D was the best , i have rly awesome memories with my childhood frens , it rly was just a very free open world game we added all kinds of elements, it was like a mixture of lores and everyone got to be what they wanted to be. A videogame but better
Just checking I want to know
Frick yes. I NEED TO GET D&D KNOW
Hey Jaden, big fan I want to ask are you an Owl House fan by any chance because I’m picking up references in your most recent video video.
You should seriously try more dnd, this video is amazing!
"...and then... you can  come in. I'M A RIDDLE DOOR!" Yup, that's definitely Charlie.
4:15 has reminded me to go watch over the garden wall again.
I'm dming for my dad and my brother. My dad played a lot of RPGs and was used to being the hero. Was a big knock down to earth when the former caravan guard shop keep didn't give him a discount because "I'm the hero who slayed three goblins."
2 of my party decided to smash a regenerating orcs nuts, while everyone else was trying to stop a cult from corrupting a god
1:31 ITS LARRY!!!!
i mean the "anything can happen" isn't 100% true of course no turning into a red dragon at lvl 1 lol but ya can do whatever within the rules and the rule of cool
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen
Well damn i gotta subscribe now
16:11 - "You're my personal hell" *followed by the most delectable arrack sound effect*
Hahaha. Oh, my!!! Love the video!!! I miss playing DnD with the guys! Haha.
I feel bad if Nintendo copyright claimed this
As a long time player of DND theres so many side games in the TTRPG (Tabletop RPG) Genre you should check out too!
I wish their voices were used in the video, but the video was still great
did jacob turn into larry from scarlet and violet?
Did anyone else notice that when the worm got hit with acid it looked like that one meme of that emoji that just evaporates
Wait ... We never got to see Jaiden's character's back story!!  This needs a sequel!!
Oh my god I love this!  I want more adventures. Lol.
I love Betarad, Hatsune Miki, Randal Booth and Sexsicle so it’s great to see them all together.
This was AMAZING!!!  Wasn't this game livestreamed?  Or maybe Alpha had a clip on his channel?  I distinctly remember the acid blast to the face.  In any case, the animation was great.  Shout out to the Vox Machina easter egg.  And the music? mmm *chef's kiss*.
Jaiden following the aro-ace stereotype of playing a dragonborn is beautiful
Its sound really fun 😮
that was pretty baller
12:36 the candle!
Love that jacob it's just Larry from pokemon hahaha
I like dnd in all.  But the One I played ruined my entire fun about it. But for those looking to play dnd I recommend not trying to have an insane complex story and give them a short game that either last 3 sessions to 10 or a long one with a great  ending.
Bing ding dong
the point blank acid blast...... i woke up half the house because i was laughting WAY to much
I . NEED . MORE!
Wish I had great friends to play DnD with but we're all too lazy and shit
0:57 alpharad Larry with a briefcase battle axe gives me life
What happened to Paul Junior the turtle?
More pls, when you do your next campaign
king dedededededede theme was the correct choice for the first battle
Pauls literally me🗿
D&D is always a classic and one of the best video games I've played (ranboo, jaiden,jacob, and slimecicle?? Best collab ever, and ranboos character is so cute help me-)
Please do more of this, it was awesome
Someone got a Nat 1, with that pepperspray
the adventure will be a lot faster if you just ask the door with a face to turn the sheep back.
HOW DOES SHE KNOW WHAT I NEED
love your videos Also I played this yesterday:)
Larry Alpharad, the funny forward arial man
Va- VAD HÄNDER!?
A cat, a businessman and a dragon walk into a bar.....
As soon as I saw the disguise self, I knew immeditately what happened next 💀
The use of deception to acid breath on Mark was GENIUS! That’s exactly what DnD shenanigans are!
Reminds me of Dmd videos like Dingo Doodles.
Please make more of these videos. Sidenote, I loved the Mario background music.
I love how Alpharad is just Larry.
See, its stuff like this that makes me enjoy D&D. If only I had people to actually play it with-
That was freaking fun.
OMG VOXXXXXX MACHINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (idk how to spell the last one- I LOVEEEE ASHLEY JHONSON)
Oh, cool. They did this custom dnd 5e module. It super cool!
15:34 Alpharad can only stare in shock as he realises the real monsters were the friends he made along the way. 😂
The turtle being robbed of it's name is the tragic easter egg
Congratulations, Jaiden! You're video is #5 on trending for gaming! 🎉
If i could guess, is Jaiden's character a Sorcerer? Because Sorcerer is a good starter class for new players and it seems like itd fit
I want part 2 it is funny 😂😂
I love D&D and I love to play it, I’m a dragon cat I also loved the D&D storyline in the video!
I've started playing D&D recently, long story short my elf wizard busted through a window screaming at the top of her lungs 🕊
When zute/jaiden’s character acid blasted the manager in the face I called it the second she turned into his wife.
I was not physically or Mentally prepared for the turning into the BBEGs wife and then acid blasting him in the face bit
DEPRESSION!!!!!
I was gonna play d&d once with my friends, left before it even started to go build a magic deck. Wow
I thing bong water was a good name for the turtle
Dannng !! The kirby air ride city trial theme song got me to the soul!! EPIC!
"Don't listen to him he's a zebra" Immedietlly asks turtle for help
I love how this is the first time jaiden has asked people to subscribe XD
i love the critical roll easter egg. love dnd, and im glad you do too :3
Ah yes, the best way to defeat a villain: *c r i p p l i n g d e p r e s s i o n*
Paul cool af. And relatable.
seemed like a really fun oneshot !
I love the commentary with the story it’s super fun and interesting!!
1:10 I love The Legend of Vox Machina.
I friggin love Paul
1:16  THIS IS A VOX MACHINA REFERENCE?
1:52 I though he was Loid from spy x family
i know @Areindeerpro is gonna watch this
The moment I see charlie is the DM I know its over
I love this it was a nice change from what you been doing.
we need you and slimcicle on dismetion 20
turned into his ____ to ___ in the face. This was indeed a true dnd moment. XD
Gotta love modern day d&d, gender neutral pronouns as to avoid possibly getting canceled in the future
1:23 FURRY!!!!!
My first time playing dnd, a 10 hour one shot, I wasted like a full hour fighting a shark. On my own. All because I wanted to catch some fish barehanded. I was a level 10 barbarian tiefling btw
What a great story.  Thank you so much for sharing.  It was a blast
MARK THOMPSON
I love that jaiden's dragonborn looks like a more friendly Susie from Deltarune
I love this kind of thing. I do rely hope you do more stuff likes this. good job on the video it was really great and fun to watch, so thanks!😊😃
ok ill unsub :troll:
I love the Vox Machina reference at 1:16
charlie and rans laugh is so amazing
This animation is SO SMOOTH! And so hilariously accurate to D&D shenanigans.... "Don't listen to him, he's a zebra!"  15:27 Will never not make me laugh
I don’t know why I’m thinking this, but a thought just crossed my mind about what Jaiden’s character alignment is. I don’t know why it popped into my head. Specifically when she blasted that guy with acid, which also gave me a good laugh as well. A really funny and smart move on her part.
We need more of this, this is so cool
holy shit it's all of my favorite Internet people in the same room together!!!!!!!
@Jaiden Animations Please join my campaign
WHY DOES THE MAN IN A SUIT LOOK LIKE LARRY FROM POKEMON SV IF HE WAS BLONDE?
A *crazy Story* the way you show it. I love you
From this, i now know the most random shit can just happen and still have relevance later on in D&D
Wait isn't the turtle also Paul Jr
It was beautiful
Cat having an extenchil crisis = my life in a nutshell
MORE PLEASE!!
PLEASE do a whole campaign PLEASE
14:45 ah yes the depression + changing to the villain ex-wife, only to deal more emotional dammage by acid blasting him in point blank. XD I remember seing this clip before, very unhinge XD
That was the strangest yet most beautiful story I have ever heard
This was a freaking riot! 😂 Loved it!
It was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
Alpheraalpharad is just larry from poketmon violet/scarlet Jaiden looks like a pokemon And ranboo is just ranboo but if he was a cat
That was dumb in every way, and I absolutely loved it. Great job on the video and I'm glad your first time playing was such a blast.
Omg this made my day!!
Love daisy circuit
I'm glad you got to experience the world of D&D! And I see that you chose dragonborn, one of my favorite races! 😄
Oh my gosh, yes! This is just good DnD in a nutshell here.😂  As someone who's first character was a Dragonborn, I approve. 😌👍
I just want to say that I find the timing to be funny, I just got out of a 10 hour dnd session LMAOOO. Am glad that many others are also enjoying the game <3
The more crazy it is, the more fun it is
16:28 now he will proceed to receive special treatment inside that pot,just like bowser!... *_pot flashbacks_*
so,... you've been playing QSMP for months now, with players the likes of Roier, Quackity, Missa, Vegetta and whatnot... and somehow you find D&D to be _more_ crazy than the things _THEY_ come up with? girl, you ain't seen the tip of the iceberg yet.
🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢
Dnd looks so cool!
Finally DND can be famous now
WE NEEED MORE OF THESES. ITS SHAKESPEARE.
Thanks for the best command word
Jaiden: "who are you" Alpharad: *proceeds to tell entire backstory*
That was really good. I hope she makes a part two to it or makes more of it and including the turtle. I did not expect that.🐢
Congrats Jaiden! In the words of the man that introduced me to DND, you're now "down with the sickness".  Looking forward to seeing you become a dice goblin xD
U CAM BE A CAT?!
I love how alpharad is Larry but with an axe
Love the critical role reference
can we get a series of like a whole campaign?
I like how Jacob's character is just a Salaryman
it must have been fun playing dnd with depressed barney stinson
MAKE MORE OF THIS IT WAS FUN!
i wish i could play dnd
what an amazing group! a dragonborne who was simply minding their business, a cat man who's just in the Stanley parable, and a depressed office worker
WAIT…  was that the music for Pokémon dungeons at the beginning!!!!!!!!
Using music from Pokemon Ranger shadows of almia. Nice reference
Adventure time horse????
I think it would be funny if someone else joined, and slime got to join the session as his character. EVEN MORE CHAOS!!!!
I love how Paul just looks like Larry
why is no one pointing out Vox Machina (im like 1:22 in and i just saw them and wanted to see if anyone else saw them)
More!! I enjoy it’ll
More!! I enjoy it’ll
14:07 SHE ANIMATED IT, SHE ANIMATED “cursed speech: DEPRESSION”
COMMAND DEPRESSION???!!!! I was so caught off guard. I haven't laughed that hard in a while
yaya! new video
bruh is that the horse from adventure time lmao 9:52
I'm stealing that clay puzzle, that's awesome!
1:51 Larry reference???
OMG I LOVE HEARING RPG STORIES!!!! Especially beuatifully-animated ones like this!!!
Turtle! Final answer! Me too me too
7:41 vibe
Funnily enough I had and probably still have quite the interest in Dungeons and Dragons it's just that A. I'm an Indonesian, and that means I can't really find anyone who's into that sort of stuff where I'm from (ok that's a lie I do know a friend but they're from far away and we only really talked through Discord) And B. In correlation to A, here is my brain in regards to everything else (pulls out moderately sized brain) and here is my brain in regards to D&D (pupils repel like magnets, and I fall to the floor while having a seizure)
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO BABYHSHSTWHWFWYW I LOVE DND SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR PLAYING AND ANIMATED IT JAIDEN😭😭😭😭
Can you please play a Fossil Fighters nuzlocke or play Fossil Fighters Champions please?
I was playing a barbarian in this one campaign, and I happened to use a hammer to kill a small enemy... and I rolled a nat 20. So with the DM's permission, I flavored it as my barbarian swinging the hammer like a golf club and sending the poor monster into the sunset while I screamed "FORE"!  Good times.
Random question, do you read Wings of fire?
Was it fun at least for you?
0:52  GOOD GOD. WHY????????? /lh
Cool
I love DnD, never really played but watched others play it...I have the imagination part down, just need some friends who want to include me in😅✊️
I❤❤❤I
I like how Pauls a mood love it
I would like more of this. Please, I *need* more!!
the way I screamed when I realised it was the sheep one shot! I tried to run it once but my players immediately killed the sheep😭
9:50 NOOOO THEY KILLED HIM!!!😢
Oh god. I'm dying. I just played my first game of D&D 7 hours ago.
I just love how alpha said fuck it go larry
Oh my god slime, alpha, ranboo , and Jaiden playing D&D
The only time I’ve ever played D&D was for an after school club back in 6th grade, and it was the most fun I’ve ever had in middle school. Probably the only fun I had in middle. Everyday after school for like a month out librarian and 4 other boys would meet in one of the math rooms and progress our story slowly. By the end of it a goblin I was highly suspicious of had died and turned into a mystical object, the leader of our troupe wielded the object and would become its protector, and I had no significant progress in my character whatsoever.
Finally jacob is playing a bored  gain
yes 7 hrs ago111
Hey, Loved this video a lot. Something new and entertaining👏👏👏👏👏
Bro is jaiden Susie from deltarune 🤨
As cool as Charlie is with the homebrew campaign I would love to see him dm a game of curse of strahd with your group
I tried playing DND but I can't see what's happening in my mind idk why but it makes the game unfun and boring
Yeah this is great, best animated D&D. Also I love that Jaiden's character just has Jujustu Kaisen cursed speech, such a cool way of flavouring a caster. Keep it up!
Oh my god! Critter references!!!! Thank you Jaiden!!!  And congrats on joining the dnd community! We look forward to any highlights of your campaigns you wish to share. Love your Dragonborn!
IS YOUR SPELLCASTING FOCUS A TONGUE TATTOO THAT"S COOL AS SHIT
I totally saw some Vox Machina members at 1:14, who else recognized Keyleth, Vex, Pike and Grog? Also nice campaign, maybe next you'll want to talk about Baldur's Gate 3. ^^
9:13 Noooo.. *_AHHHHHHHHH_* *_gets reduced to atoms_*
Hi I Remember when I first played dnd and I was a elven ranger that was always high sold spoons and was a murderer and when I was on a mission I caused two vampires to overdose on my blood
Ah, while unfortunely i have had little luck with finding a group, one time in my school's dnd club i got to throw a chair at a jedi force pulling themselves back through the window someone threw them out of (we were a star wars themed dnd group)
Me and my friend play a pokemon version of D&D. You should try that lol
Who needs vox machina when we got this  Can we get more of this?😊
The thing That shocks me the most is the fact that The odd1sout posted a video today too like Jaiden
Loving this dnd video especially since if been getting into dnd myself and am hoping to sometime soon have my first session. I would love to see how the rest of this campain goess lol
How has the most well-known asexual never played dnd before now?
I heard if you say your favorite YouTubers name 3 times so tell me if it works Jaiden Animations Jaiden Animations Jaiden Animations Did it work?
Loved this!
The fact Jaiden was not an Aarakocra makes me sad
i like how jaiden's character just has an emotional scene with mark then just disintegrates their skin LOL
Коли нарешті вийдуть «Бункер і дракони»😭❤❤❤?!? Джейден це була шикарна історія, ДЯКУЮ!!!
LOL Alpha is playing as D&D's version of Larry. Lemme guess: human fighter? Can't get more Normal than that.
"IT'S WORMIN' TIME"
Hearing music from Mario and a Luigi Superstar Saga in this vid gave me whiplash, one of my favorite games and OSTs ever—a welcome surprise!! Great video!
Oh my gosh! Vox Machina at 1:15 ! I caught the nod and I love it
Holy hell, was this the wild sheep chase quest? I’ve running about three times and every time it’s been great
I fully expected Alpha to name the turtle “Subscribe.”
I TOTTALY SAW COMING TAHT MARK AND TOMPSON ARE THE SAME CARAHCTER WHEN HE SAID THE FULL NAME
Love D&D tbh
I miss the old jaiden,the always upload jaiden,the cool jaiden.I hate the new jaiden,the barely upload jaiden,the weird jaiden.
JAIDEN WATCHES VOX MACHINA DUDEEEE OMG
Please do more!
Yes queen
this is soo sickkk!!!! sad that you couldnt get the others to voice act tho 🥴🥴
i ended up starting a forest fire and becoming a dictator when I first played dnd
This video is the best thing ever since I love your video 📸
4:14 I love how she put Fuecoco as one of the random animals.
the moment i saw the sheep i think i know what this is
This story was crazy and I loved it! 🥰
You should do more dnd stories that was funny and fun to watch
SESSION 2 NOW PLEASE
In the current campaign I’m in I’m playing as an owlin barbarian who has basically become the group mascot
Alpharad is just Larry from Pokémon
what is D&D?
Jaiden Yuki, I have a question, I seen you played Competitive Pokémon, but did you ever participated in any Regional or either International Pokémon Tournament. P.D. I was Joking with The spelling of Your name, Jaiden Yuki Is The Prota of Yu-Gi-Oh GX series.
A classic example of D&D. Wild, chaotic, insane, and loads of fun.
Your ace colored dragon character made me so happy as a fellow aroace person 🥰
I been following you for a while before i subscribed. and i wonder how you would act in a more serious campaign, id love to join you in that.
IGHT SHE SAID IT I GOTTA UNSUBSCRIBE.
This is hilarious. It was my first time playing DND yesterday!  I was a Changeling Sorcerer who owns a voodoo shop, has a pet mouse, constantly scams people with their bard bestie, and seduced an elf girl! I didn’t think such a complex thing could be so much fun
OMG wtf it's so goooooooooooood
Is Alpharad trying to live the Scarlet/Violet Larry life?
2:12 OKAY the animation here is RIDICULOUSLY SMOOTH im talking like jaiden dancing to dim sum battle theme level smooth!
NAH NOT THE CHILD RUNNING AWAY
Dooooooppppeeeeee
If you guys think that Charlies oneshot was cool you should check out just roll with it (jrwi) his dnd podcast
That was so good~ I always love hearing about newcomers to D&D play! New players always make for the most fun games~ This video is an excellent example of what D&D is all about~
This Was Great - More please
Acid scene killed me
so i just played dnd, and it was very... spicy
The fact that the other two goblins aside from Gob and Glob weren't named Grod and Grob is deeply saddening to me
jaiden has a dragon fursona real /j
MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
awesome vox machina refrence
Gotta love D&D when the answer is as obvious as Laup and Paul but none of the party get it
The vox machina in the beginning 😂😂
Now wait until you fight a lich :)
I played DnD once (I played as a kind elf hybrid), and it was nice to watch this!
Oh yeah the sheep one, that was a nice twist your dm did making the sheep not just the evil wizards apprentice
im pretty sure whenever i play DnD i go completely unhinged an example being: theres an ice plague going around and me and my group are sent to stop it and instead of gathering information i then proceed to go sledding and break into an old womans house and another time we were riding on weird giant birds and i was jsut like: can i eat it? i then proceed to abandon ship mid fight and hang on for dear life onto my friends bird while wondering if i can eat it
1:15 1:17 vox Machina!!!
This is 100% a typical DnD session. Loved every second of it!! 😂
I can tell Ranboo was playing a bard but I have no clue what Jaiden and Alphard were playing class wise do yall know?
Do even more of these dnd
So far the campaign im a part of is going ok…
DND TIME BABY
Yessssssssssssssss❤ she’s a dragon born
1:16 I love vox machina
This is awsome, definitely want another video of this
probably my most favorite vid. I love dnd storytelling and doubly so with animated versions. I hope there is more like this one in the near future :D
I love dnd you can just do stupid random things for no reason. also funny how paul unintentionally threw his son and almost gave him a concussion lol
That was amazing!
2/3 of the cast are furrys 4/10 for this needs more none furries😔  I need a session two now
Well, this was certainly an interesting and wild Story, i wonder if there’ll be a Sequel?  Anyway, is D&D campaigns usually this wild?  You should do something like this again at some point, if it isn’t too much trouble, of course.  Say, do you know of Pokémon D&D or maybe TableTop?  Actually, what is the difference between D&D and Tabletop?
new vid
That was amazing and the acid breath to the face was hilarious. 10/10
Paul channeled his inner Yoshikage Kira
Boy it's a good thing you didn't make the statues and THEN eat them.  That lol random coulda backfired HARD.  Also: I noticed you did the right of passage move here at 7:35 ; That of course being to fail a puzzle the ONLY way you could.
Jaiden can you post more pls
I would LOVE to see more dnd from you, one of the most entertaining things I’ve seen from you
...was that the Mana Beast?
That was super sick! Would love to see the actual session in full
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
NOOOOOOO IS THAT THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME 😭😭😭😭😭😭
That was so cute and cool
Nice content kid
Ofc jadien choose dragon born
Okay, using Command to make someone Depressed is genuinely inspired😂
CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I loved!!!! Your DND story, I’m currently looking for a party to join or create but it’s fun to listen to stories from my favorite animators😁😁😁
Oh this was so fun to watch!! I hope we get more content like this.
Ranboo being a cat is the most ranboo thing ever
Nahhhhh THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCEEEEEE
14:05 You ate that Jaiden
you know what I expected Jaiden to immediately acid blast mark because it can be that simple without a little content also bruh poor mark I love this vid
15:29 Is too funny😂😂
THAT WAS SO FUNNY
Is alpharad larry?
Jaiden is a dragon, Jacob is Larry and Ranboo is a... Cat?
as someone who just started playing DnD, the whole info dumping your background to a new character part is so real omg  💀 this was amazing
"D&D is very popular" Now that's a crazy sentence I never thought I'd hear and have it be true.
After watching this video i only want to play D&D more.
paul kind of looking like larry
My first dnd session started with me getting scammed by a goblin feeding me poison corn(while I was immune to poison)  And ending with my party nuking the city it happened in.
In dnd i once kicked an enemys balls during a war and it killed him his friends got so scared that he ran away their boss f****** killed him that means that soldier was more afraid of me than his own boss lol
I'd love to play DnD with you.
Why is the salary man hot
Amazing video your ending has so unhinged I loved it
Ngl, i did wojack gasp and point when i saw the Vox Machina reference
This was lots of fun to watch and listen to.  Your animations are always great. I'm in the process of starting a Pathfinder campaign with my friends right now, and this just makes me more excited about it.
Was it just me or did people notice a lot of adventure time references
More of this!!! Also use their voices for their characters maybe?
The stick of truth!
This was great!
Please ignore this lol  1:26 2:16 2:56 3:26 6:20 7:08 12:17 14:20
Great day to be an ella 😘😘
Jaiden and JoCat collab when?
me neither
All in favor of getting a behind-the-scenes video for this
That was FANAMINAL!!!
Nanami, that sheep, the persona cat, and that digimon are sure in for it going against uncle gumball
THIS WAS SO FUN TO WATCH!! I just got into D&D recently so this was a very enjoyable video!
Now we sit back and wait for the Zoot (Zuut? Zewt?) fanart to roll in.
I would love to see more of this! This was so cool!
I love how Paul (not jr) is basically Larry from scarlet and violet (pokemon)
As soon as I saw alphas character I whisper screamed larry
The way you blasted mark's face after tricking him tho!!!!!! XD
Jaiden is so savage in these... I love it.
i have utterly no idea what to make of this, other than that if i ever meet someone named mark thompson i shouldn’t trust them
Well, this sure does sound like a Wild Sheep's Chase that you went on!
“And proceeds to acid blast him directly in the face from the mouth”
Using the one word command to give mark depresion has got to be one of the best ways to use it lmao
Justice for mark
I CAST THUNDER SPELL! (sophist reference lmao)
Not through the video yet but I think I recognize this adventure! I've read a module where the party meets a sheep with a speak-with-animals scroll that was polymorphed and asks the party to go into the wizard's tower to get the wand to turn him back.  BUT if it is that module I've also noticed multiple ways Charlie customized it for the group which is the hallmark of a good DM. Makes me glad Jaiden had a good intro into the world of D&D.
Hey, it's the Vox Machina!
W PAUL
hey, does anyone know what the song is from minute 16:30? the last song of the video pls
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH VOX MACHINA I SAW THAT
Damn everything is so confusion me now 😅
how did i know that you were going to acid blast marks face when you pulled back from him also good job
Is Jacob just Larry from pokemon Scarlet/Voilet?
OH YOU DID THE SHEEP CHASE with some changes! But! That’s awesome!
I wanna dnd
Holdup, a sheep carrying a speak with animals spell? There was a premade campaign online with a really cool and funny story with the same thing and a bed dragon
14:53 OH MY GOD I REMEMBER SEEING THAT CLIP
So THIS is what what happened with the sad acid blast
This video was incredible. Animation and DND go hand in hand.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN ALPHARAD VIDEO
Let’s go I’m no that weird for loving dnd
I am still confused on how this D&D works. ^^’
Fantastic DND session thanks to everyone who made this possible! Also can’t believe SirMeowMusic worked on this video?!? He’s come a long way. :)
WILD SHEEP CHASE!
I  LOVE playing DnD! My high school has a club that I’m a part of. My character is a tabaxi monk named Kaida with daddy issues cuz she grew up in a cult church after being abandoned by her birth family, was forced to be an assassin, killed her best friends because they wouldn’t pay said taxes at 14 and then lived in the woods alone for 7 years, ended up in some mystery circus with all her memories being lost. Then she met her current campaign, harassed a cotton candy vendor, got pushed down the stairs, got impaled thru the shoulder with a javelin and got was engaged to an air genasi but he DISAPPEARED!! AND THEN SHE FORGOT HIM!!! The disappearing fiancée and memories of him vanishing happened really recently cuz we played the other day, I hope u had a lot of fun! This game is so unhinged it’s so funny!
I love how Jaiden was a dragon, ranboo was a cat, and Alpharad was literally just Larry but with extra lore
PART 2 PLS
I saw the live stream of this, it was amazing :3
Scaly Jaiden Scaly Jaiden
Bruh, imaging yelling depression at someone and then they instantly become depressed.
Babe wake up jaden posted
casually deciding to animate an entire episode for a youtube video
I was waiting with bated breath for Jaidens character to just bite Marks face off, Acid Breath was more entertaining for sure 😂
luap? ... oh(paul)
More!
4:13 The beast…in the woods… 9:50 As well as the ice king…  Man I love references/Easter eggs
i love how jacob is just a recoloured larry
Dragonborn Jaiden gives me life as a fellow scaly boi
You are now legally required to make this into a series and then crossover with fools gold …no reason
15:00 I no joke actually cried here. Like, full blown sobbing. For Mark. MARK!!!
My first DnD character died on session two
FUCK YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
This sounds like the perfect game for Jaiden, well done guys for introducing her to it,
Make more of these!! They’re so funny
Awesome video!!!! This is so new and cool
This was so amazing!!!!!
I'm glad it had a happy ending 😊
I loved this!
:D
relatable i have never played it
I loved this and would love to see another one
Me watching this, with my own D&D session early tomorrow morning: hype!!!
Don't think you can sneak a CritRole reference past me👀
That was the so cool
I’m honestly more surprised Alpharad didn’t name his evil manager Jan 😂
9:50 why is there the fake horse from adventure time does that mean ice king died
Fantastic!
This Paul guy is definitely based of Larry from Pokémon
141k
DO THIS AGAIN 🤩🤣
Bro i called it me charlie think alike now I knew the sheep was paul jr
I Would Be Down With Another one of these DND Videos for Real
This animation was amazing I would love to see another D&D animation
0:56 JAIDEN IS THE ENDER DRAGON!!!!!!
Welcome to the community, good choice with the critical roll cameo XD
This is definitely going to be one of your most popular videos, similarly to the nuzlocke ons but in the DND community
YEAHHHHH BABY
Hmmm, yes. Become hooked on d&d. Hmmmm, yeeesss. Make d&d content.....
Love the box machina reference
I love it
My first dnd sesion i got super drunk shot set on fire and eaten by a bunny now dnd is my faverout game
Poor paul
great video!
The shout of “DEPREssion” Has me crying
Wow so cool it looks so fun
Oh my God finally. Dnd is so fun and I wish more ppl played it
Love the Vox Machina reference at the beginning
been waiting for another Jaiden vid
Thanks for referencing Vox Machina.
Oh my gosh, this was funny
The Mario & Luigi Super Star Saga music throughout the video really fits!
This was an amazing D&D game!
Adventure time horse
This really was baby's first dnd, and not a good one
that was so awesome, i want more.
Not my actual father’s name being Mark Thompson
I really like your anthropomorphic dragon design! Really cool (:
*DEPRESSION* !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great video
If you like Dungeons and Dragons, you could also check out Pathfinder 2nd edition!
oh noes teh pengin. he ded.
Zoot puls back just to look into Mark's eyes whitch are sparkling with tears "and proceeds to acid blast him point blank from the mouth" this cean killed my
I would watch this series. I love DnD stories
These are like, exactly the type of quests I go on in D&D lmao!
I LOVED THIS! I really like dnd I hope you love dnd as much as me after this
Has ur style changed it looks wonky in a good way
why does paul make me think of larry from pkmn scarlet and violet?
Does paul's backstory at 1:39 remind anybody else of Yoshikage Kira's speech?
RANBOO????? not who i was expecting to see in a jaiden video but i am here and present for it
jaiden i love you but why are you talking to a dr*am smp person
Crazy how well you did ranboo’s verbal mannerisms
this was so good
01:15 ah love the Critical Role characters
Larry 2 electric paularoo
Alpharad is literally just Larry
kiki vex grog and pike ! that's some nice lil reference there Chapeau
VOX MACHINA!?!?!
I love the chaotic nature of this video
Paul is Larry alpharad
This was the most single handedly chaotic Group of adventurers ever
Jaiden is the type of person to be Jaiden is the type of person.
I loved the Vox Machina reference in the very beginning
:) so good
Can't wait for the second session so we can get a mighty nein reference in the animation. Long live the king of games.
This is everything a DM wishes for: an insane party.
One of my favorite sessions with a friend was managing to befriend a giant albino centipede with PURE CHARISMA, and thus it became my pet. Would've certainly died otherwise. The power of Bards & Nat 20s, everyone! ✨️
I love playing P&P and this video is a great introduction to what it feels like to play.
Charlie looks amazing by the way love your content and Charlie is one of my favorite YouTubers
Do it again!
We need fanart of Dragonborn Jaiden.
You should ask them to voice their own characters, it would bring so much more life and feeling of uniqueness of to the characters
one of the best things about DnD is you can do do anything. We had this Dragonborne Child whom we used as a homing missile by throwing her at literally anything lmfao
i love how dorky jaiden's character is lol
JADEN!…..can we get a vid/podcast of the audio?
Amazing. That’s all I’ll say.
Big thankies from mcspankies to Baldur's Gate 3 for finally breaking the mold for letting me see the true beauty and 'magic' of D&D:)  For so long, I never thought I'd find myself actually loving it anywhere near as much as I i do, at all... but now... I get it:)  Better late than never, I suppose...
Ah yes the greatest spell "DEPRESSION"
this. this is excactly why i play dnd.
Such a fun chaotic little one-shot/ first session. Will love to see more stories like this!
"So paul so-long gay bowsers laup into the air" I hate that thats a sentence that makes sense.
why does Paul look like Larry?
I have once shoved a dead cats leg into a homeless man’s throat…….. how about you?
DnD wow so fun.. Waiting for the highlights😊
Did I catch the boss music from Pokemon Ranger: Shadows of Almia in there?
One time on dnd 2.0 I was a halfling rouge trying to free a bunch of slaves from a group of Ogors. I used my sneak skills and assassination abilities to disable to the guards and then setup spikes in front of the tents and then set all the tents on fire. A bunch of ogors died that day on spikes and in flames. Don’t underestimate the halfling.
Anyone else get completely mind blown by the Mark Thompson reveal
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER IN THE DAY!! YESSSSSS
This needs a full anime
Love how the Wind Waker theme is on❤
Looks like a really fun, self contained session! Seems like your DM is the sort that likes to have fun with natural 1s, def makes for fun storytelling. Poor Gobblegob getting the dub :-(
another video nice
is jacob playing as larry from pokemon s&v??
Loved this, but as someone who plays the bagpipes, I'm sobbing XDDDD
RANBOOOO!!!!!!
Can we get more of this? Like please?
That was genuinely hilarious
Adventure Time Reference?(at 9:53)
I ENJOYED WATCHING THIS SO MUCH
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Please please plase don't tell me I was the only one who cried when mark thought he saw his wife.... 😭
This was awesome  Y’all should totally play more
Dice go brrrrrrrrrrtttt
You were supposed to throw us a ladder, not fall into the TTRPG hole WITH us
ah, today is a good day. all my favorite youtubers  playing my favorite game ever. thank you jaiden, this was amazing.
9:13 you did NOT just make a worms death into an emote lmaoo
May I ask what your class is
I didn't know I needed Ranboo drawn in Jaiden's style, but it's great! Glad you had fun!
Finally I’ve been waiting for a topic like this!
I am Alpharius.
DND makes for such good stories to tell
when you said about disguise as mark's wife i remembered about the acid
This made me chuckle
Love how Paul is based off of Larry from V/S lol
this reads like a fever dream and I LOVE IT!
I adore Paul he's just a depressed Walmart version of sanji
Love the cameo from horse with poo brain
7:07 .. where .. where did the briefcase and ax come from?
I am VERY excited you’ve stepped into the D&D world Jaiden. The stories are ENDLESS.
i want more animated dnd
AWWW LIL CAT RAN!!!
Ah yes the wild sheep chase
Lmao i saw that Over the Garden Wall Beast reference! 😂
i remember seeing clips of you acid blasting him and i didn't know that you were going to animate it and i'm happy you did because that was freaking hilarious
I LOVE THIS, I WANT MORE DND CONTENT SO BAD. IT WAS SO FUNNY AND RANDOM ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh this is definitely a dungeon charlie would write
This story sounds like it was generated by an AI. I love it.
I've been playing for years, and it's always nice to hear about a first time player having a good time. My congrats to the DM! Also, this is the first time I've heard about this channel. Like the art style. 👍
i remember watching this live lol
alpharads character is literally larry. I love it
It be really cool if there was a DnD series on the channel. AND HOLY COW THATS SOME REALLY GOOD ANIMATION!
YIPPIE ANOTHER JAIDEN VIDEO FOR MY ENJOYMENT
It was funny when she just proceeds to pretend to be his wife and then also proceeds to just blast him in the face
I have been waiting for this day for 2 years
What a great video! I'm always thrilled to hear about new players' experiences and to have such fun visuals to go along with it was phenomenal!
I never thought i needed larry alpharad in my life but im glad i have him
WOAHHHH
I hope we get to see a few more videos like this, it was absolutely hilarious, and all the walmart references made me laugh and smile the whole time.
I need subtitles for the door -.-
Just wondering what Jaiden would do playing Paranormal Order...
You should make an animated Pokémon D and D with some friends of yours, it's the only version of D and D I watch on YouTube, it's popular and looks like a blast, honestly if I was a YouTuber, I would totally do one myself. 😊
THIS WAS THE FUNNIEST THING IVE EVER SEEN😭
They should make an anime about this😃
dude, I legit shed tears for mark lmfao this was awesome
dnd is awesome, even though i just started playing a week ago
Then make a D&D channel I’ll watch and listen
I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE ACID, I SAID IT OUT LOUD AND THEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS
I was genuinely shocked when Jaiden pronounced “Ranboo” as “Rahn-Boo” it took me back to 2021 😭😭
Happy very late birthday (also me and you share the same birthday)
See my funniest one is when I bombed an entire cloud giant castle we were supposed to escort to good king A’s place, yeahhhh… it came back in many pieces. But playing artificer was funnnn.
I love dnd, but have never played
I rolled a 2, can I still say this is prolly one of the most amazing animated DnD one-shots I've seen yet?
alpharad's character reminds me of larry from pokemon scarlet and violet haha
Alpharad is literally Larry from Pokemon
This is how D&D should be played, all out fun.
As a person who never plays D&D, I wished someday I would play it. (I did watch the movies tho so I think counts right?)
Yo fucking Mark just pulled an Obito from Naruto
So loved how we skipped the evil bird and also zoot needing to sacrifice the ward to a demon or something.
Better than the D&D movie
i loved the otgw references in paul jrs naming :)
I was not ready to tear up at the ending 🥹
Alpharad quite literally being Larry makes that comic that implies he was originally Isekaid into Pokemon even better
VOX MACHINA!!!
I love how the different options for the turtle’s name is just an Over the Garden Wall reference to the different things Greg named his frog
The Vox Machina reference got me at the beginning lol
Did anyone notice alpharad kinda had the same outfit as Larry from pokemon Scarlet and Violet?
I can feel the Jacob just wanted to play Larry energy. Top tier. I've never done DnD but this is hysterical
THE BEAST!!! THE BEAST IS UPON ME!!!!?!?!?!?! 4:14
I pray you will make more of these, I’ve been trying to find a fully animated DnD session for a while now, and this is like removing a tumor that developed from that itch I wanted to scratch.
Hey @jadienanimations first of here is a joke. Did you hear about the teenager who failed his driving test? He thought it was a crash course.  Second. Did you know there is a tabletop version of pokémon d&d called Pokémon Tabletop United or PTU. It's super fun and I highly recommend it I run a campaign with some people using and though you might like it since it's both Pokémon and D&d. That's all! Love the videos
This was great and im totally down for more or any similar types of videos you might not be sure about, this is great👌
You have to do this again! Also, please upload highlights!
I love that you put phb my friend ad I use that and everyone in our group hates it it is so funny
I’d like to point out how Paul is literally a blond Larry from Pokémon
I love how a minute in there was a "Legend of Vox Machina" reference
I’m kind of new to dnd, what was the pentagram on Jaidens tongue and vocal spells supposed to represent?
Wow just wow that is crazy I am about cry
I'd love to see more D&D content from you.
THIS IS ONE OF YOUR BEST VIDEOS IT MAKES ME WANT TO PLAY D&D WITH MY FRIENDS
I love D&D and when one of my favourite make a video about it, i am very happy. Your animation is pretty cool!
I kinda wish I didn't know that the acid-blast was coming XD
DEPRESSO TIME! - Mark, the manager of Ye Old Mart of Wal.
ALL MY FAVORITE CREATORS IN ONE AMAZING VIDEO DOING SOMETHING I LOVE IM SO!!!!!! this whole video was amazing:3 so happy to see it and so so so excited to hopefully see more!!!
The vox machina refernce at the start !!!😂
I like how Alpha is just straight up larry
Jaiden and D&D, this is the best day !  Also I am amazed at how good Jaiden is to do all the voices for these characters, all of them were incredible.
That was awesome! Can’t wait to see more :)
session 2 pls now
If I could subscribe twice I would do that cause daaaamn that rizz at the beginning XD
This was so great bro 😭😭
Great DnD video
Never thought I'd feel more sorry for the bad guy... homie just missed his ex-wife and child 🥺
I was in a one-shot with a similar premise: a person was transfigured into a goat, and needed help recovering the wand that would turn him back. The quest is completed, the battle is won, and I triumphantly point the wand at the goat, casting the transfiguration spell. I roll very poorly. The goat melts into a puddle.
This was awesome. I wonder when the next session will happen
Nothing has made me laugh harder at D&D than when I first saw the clip of the disguise self into point blank acid blast back during the original session 😂
Charlie/Slimecicle/Charlie Slimecicle/"Im Burgers"
That's awesome fun adventure ❤😂
❤
1:15 VOX MACHINA!!!
if you playing more dnd means more vids like this then PLEASE play more dnd!
If I had a nickel for everytime a popular streamer/youtuber's dnd session ends with a confrontation with an evil Walmart manager, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
i absolutely adore the brief vox machina sighting
Please tell me when alpharad made the penguin he was thinking about marss throughing the penguin and breaking the tv at smash summit?
I did not know how much I needed this omfg
I have a story to tell of my own Our former group was of villains from various franchises for this story. I was Ganondorf, there was Kronk from Emperor's New Groove, Deathstroke, Doctor Octopus, and a couple others. We started in a cell only to be let out because I used my magic to go small and then big to open the door from the other side. We walked down the hall until we came to a door that let into a 4-door room where there was a door on each wall. the two on the sides were barred off at the moment but the one ahead of us was massive and through said door appeared a giant goblin skeleton. It could speak and it said it was the deity of the realm but had no name so it asked us for a name that could be known far and wide throughout the realm for his followers to know him as. While we were thinking up names for it, Kronk decided to suggest, " How about Squirrel?" So knowing Ganondorf's high Charisma stat I somehow rolled a Nat 20 and was able to persuade the deity to accept the name "Squirrel", he then suddenly grew wings and flew out of the open ceiling leaving us to go through the open door. On the outside I could see a squirrel jumping through the trees and laughed saying, " Welp there's our deity right now." The DM Shelby was so flabbergasted that we succeeded that we BROKE his story for the campaign. Which was hilarious since it was the shortest one ever, that's why DnD can be fun.  Now if only I could find more people to enjoy it with.
I WANNA PLAY D&D SO BAD 😭
Why is thalamew kinda skrunkly
I RIZZED UP AN ANGEL IN D&D
So hyped for that highlight reel vid!
This may not have been your traditional D&D game with Tolkien levels of magic, elves, dwarves, and evil gods and sorcerers, but it was still D&D regardless based on the sheer level of chaos and party shenanigans honestly, if you guys did another session or entirely new campaign I'd love to see it
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
i love how paul looks perpetually tired of everything
welcome to the club it only goes downhill from here
Awesome Video
I absolutely love that alpharads character is just Larry from pokemon
Adter video, DnD has now become popular
the Vox Machina Cameo made me happy tear up :')
I love dnd i have a lvl 4 character he is wolfborn
I pretty sure that’s the adventure time horse on a stick
THE BEAST FROM OVER THE GARDEN WALL MADE AN APPEARANCE
very nice. So many 1s rolled by the DM...
I love how these people pretty much made deltarune
We have Ranboo: Little cat guy that’s been stuck in a time loop Jaiden: Dragonborn  Alpha: Larry
i am a little sad there was no bird.... but we can't have it all, i suppose
FANTASTIC VIDEO!!
ABSOLUTELY FUCKING AMAZING!!! MOAR!!!
Keylith and Vex!
Everyones first character is always a Dragonborn
I am 2 minutes into this, and I already love the characters. I don't think I've ever screamed out in joy as much as I did when when Thalamew was introduced.  Zoot's fucking snoot just drooping down at times kills me. I also love the magic circle on Zoot's tongue. That's so damn clever.  Paul is member of a popular gym leader's lineage  The shows in the forest are great. Beware the Ari  Turtle is always the answer. That is why we yeet the turtles.  "I want to look him in the eyes as I acid burn his face off"
got ranboos voice mannerisms down
This is the best vid you've ever made keep up the good work 😊
Beep beep ima a sheep XD
that was an amazing dnd story! I would imagine that this sort of thing is right up Slimecicle's alley because he did a great job, not to mention an amazing animation as always from Jaiden.
I need this to be full dnd sessions that i can watch this seems hilarious
went to a park right by the dangerous street.
Jaiden should animate some of her DND adventures in the future. change my mind.
Could you imagine having Slime as your DM?? Please do more! We’ll watch every single episode
This was delightful. Thank you for making it. :)
The use of the Kirby Air Ride OST is **Chef's Kiss**
I played DnD a while ago  One of the people there flirted with a wall ( we here trapped in a cave) and the wall vanished and we walked right out, this was single-handedly the weirdest DnD experience ever
I did a very similar story for my first session. We had to turn a sheep back into a human, except, one of our party members failed to give another party member shoes made out of meat (it was his dream for some reason) which turned him into a flesh monster
This was such a chaotic, enjoyable rollercoaster!
Neet
well well well
The axes BOMERANGS ITSELF?! I LOVE THIS LMFAO
The Depression spell 💀
I have no idea what I just watched but it was beautiful I think
DND is a goated game. if only I had the time to play it more. Screw home work
References made in this video that I got:  0:26- The Onion chariot from Shrek (2001). 1:12- Keyleth, Vex'ahlia, Grog Strongjaw, and Pike Trickfoot from The Legend of Vox Machina. 4:15- The Beast from Over the Garden Wall. 8:01- Paul’s clay sculpture is Pingu. 9:51- The horse the goblins are cooking is the horse that Ice King dressed up as to spy on Finn and Jake in Adventure Time. 14:23- The World’s Smallest Violin from SpongeBob SquarePants Season 3 Episode 48b, Squilliam Returns.  I don’t know if I got all the references in this video, let me know I missed any!!!
I like how Charlie is calling everyone psychos when he definitely came up with Mark the neighbor animal-turner walmart manager
Please, do a video watching Digimon. Japanese audio with English sub, please (the English soundtrack is shit) You've got into the Digimon fandom from the wrong door. Pokemon is a game franchise with anime, Digimon is an anime franchise with games.
Is that some Nerdy voice actors I see at 1:15
I WANT MOOOORE
The joke about being a regular worker at Walmart and Paul looking like Larry from Paldea is perfect, I can't stop laughing, especially since I was on my lunch break at Walmart when I heard first heard that.
You know its a good day when jaiden posts oml-
I love the Vox Machina refrence in the beginning!
I thought you left YouTube for good you were gone for so long
The vox machina cameos!
The Paul "so long gay Bowser-ing" the sheep is such a niche underrated joke and I had to pause the video to compose myself
gotta love those dragon expressions
jaden im offically hooked on dnd i want to play
Dorks and degenerates ?
Ranbo: a cat that likes music Jaiden: throwing up acid dragon Alferd: a depressed old man with atleast his whole family dead
Did someone else noticed Vox Machina? I like it !!!! Definitely like and subscribe
Turtle final awns- it’s a worm
Jaden got rizz
Yoooooo adventure time horse
I want to learn how to play so bad 😂
“So Paul so long gay-bowsers the sheep” is a sentence ONLY DND COULD MAKE YOU SAY OUT LOUD. Love it
Bro I WAS NOT EXPECTING "and acid blasts him point blank in the face" HOLY CRAP THATS UNHINGED AND INSANE. Im going to have to pull that one soon
What so Paul threw his own son at the wall!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!????!!!!!!!!!
Trying dnd tonight for the first time. Took 3 hours creating the character yesterday. I feel you so much.
Slimecicle: The first boss Jaiden: The boss as a playable character Alpharad: Depressed Phoenix Wright Ranboo: That one stupid character from literally the most obscure japanese game in the world
Men would rather spend years turning into dark wizards than go to therapy.
I think it so funny that Alpharad is just playing Larry from Pokemon
random comment
I love how Alpha is just Larr--I mean... Paul...
I’m surprised Jaiden wasn’t an Aarakocra
Why did i think that the "casual talk" was a jojo reference
12:38 So, Paul threw his son twice
I know I can't be the only one who wants to be an entire series, right?
<3
Larry
emotionally, i am that turtle
as soon as you said conversation a twisted tea add came on and i put it together
I am Paul and Paul is me 😂
Not even 2 minutes in and Alpharad is Larry I love the sheep. "Why the BAAA did you try to spray me with mace?!" XD BONGO CAT, yes! "Oh yeah, double or nothing!" Those goblins are eating the weird horse. I bet it has poo brain. Good use of alter self, and HILARIOUS visual representation XD I probably would have done the point blank breath weapon, too Fun little one shot. I'm glad Luap got fixed and not blastedby accident.
SHE HAS #5 ON TRENDING-
I see your Vox Machina reference at 1:14 and your Over the Garden Wall reference at 4:15
That was so good
Jaiden playing a Dragonborn made me do an unflattering squeal of joy, and I regret nothing
THIS WAS AWESOME AND HILARIOUS OMG XD
i wish all D&D games could be animated to life like this
Of Course Jaiden Chose Dragonborn, oml that makes way too much sense if you see what dynamics of people usually choose certain races from dnd. This is wonderful keep up the great work!
As a dm who usually does horror stuff this was a really nice change of pace
THE SLUDGE IS AT IT AGAIN
LOVE IT!!
Yay, a video about Jaiden playing a fun, creative, and engaging game, wonder how it turned out for her
I’y live in Chicago
What's the song at 12:27 ?
15:21  The funny
1:16 i recognize my girl keyleth anywhere. love the vox machina reference lol
I’ve watched only two DnD videos and both have a Walmart employee as the finale boss…
THAT WAS AN AMAZING VIDEO FANTASTIC   ( i guessed the luap thing as soon as we met him but it was a super awsome capaign congrats
I love the quality and I was wondering why you weren’t posting this was big😂
why is the sheep british 3:26
I’m not the only on but Alpharad=Larry?
I love how slime looks in maidens stylr
This is currently my favorite Jaiden animations video :D
She talks about the is in the voice chat podcast a long time ago.
Love the Vox Machina reference in the inn!
I love someones first time playing dnd, cause veterans fall into all the classic tropes of fantasy (i.e. stubborn dwarves, proud elves etc.) But then you get the most unhinged stuff when people who've NEVER played the game try to interact.  Oh you encounter a door with a face? You try to impress it with bongos?  Talking Sheep? Better blow up the tavern, and follow it.  Classic Backstory? Try Walmart Employee and Groundhog Day.  I love this stuff, I hope we get to see a session 2!
9:51 That’s the horse disguise the ice king used to spy on finn and Jake.
I love the “Mario and Luigi: superstar saga” themes!!!
not me coloring my character design while watching
This was awesome!!
Hi ya Jaiden
I don't know if it was intentional, but "Mark" is actually the norwegian word for worm
That heartwrenching moment being literally obliterated by acid to the face was just amazing 😂 I didn't expect that twist.
Did anyone else catch that AlphaRad’s character looks like Larry from Pokémon Scarlet & Violet?
Well now that ranboo and jaiden have done a collab kinda I can die happy
Hi Jayden, I really like your work. And about your video about DND 😂My friends and I decided to get together during the holidays and play one game. I’m from Russia, but we played the usual DND 5 like (I don’t understand this) in general. I came up with a character of an Asian warrior and dm (my friend) was thinking about how best to fit me into the plot. I was just a worker in a tavern when I suddenly met an unusual team of travelers and decided to become one of them. And the first thing I decided to do was go to tavern and celebrate with a glass of beer. Dm told me to throw K20 And I get 20. the most important number that decides everything whether you win or not. I won. And the DM came up with an unusual gift for me: 1 mug of beer plus 3 mugs as a gift. And the whole round I drank beer while my the new team was dying from a boss spider with 2 million HP. But I drank beer and don’t regret anything.
I liked when the worm said “it’s wormin time” and then wormed everywhere. That was funny.
This is hilarious and I’d love to see more!
You should try mouse guard
When I saw poul I thought he was a character from Harry Potter😅
Brooo why paul built like larry from pokemon scarlet & violet💀
More of a Warhammer fan myself but DND is also fun
Is Paul supposed to be nanami from jujutsu kaisen Edit the only problem I do have is the lack of background but overall I do love you videos
Why is jacob just Larry??? haha
WHAT DID RAN PLAY???
I just dont trust a riddle door that balantly tells me its a riddle door. nope
Larrrrrrrry!  And love the vox machina
Anyone wondering abt the time loop thing?
And about that time loop?!
ADVENTURE TIME horse reference 9:52
He had to make a crown didn't he.  You know, as in CROWN OF MADNESS
It's wonderful to see one of my favourite animators animates D&D, wonderful animations too!
Oh I’m here for this! I love D&D even if I stink at it (I got the nickname Critical Failure. .. I rolled so many 1’s that I had the powers of Kenny from South Park as I died so often..) I’m loving this.
you should do this again
holy crap, that was so cool, I need more
You should stream a session two so we can get a vod
All my homies fuckin hate mark thompson 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Love the Vox Machina cameo!
This makes me so happy I’m going to be sick
0:55 KITTYYYYY  PSPSPPSPSPSPSPSPSPPSPS
We need more adventures with these characters this is too interesting
That was so funny! I honestly wish I can play D&D more… I’ve played it once and have had an itch for it for years! The animation is awesome as usual, and I friggin LOVED that point-blank range acid attack! XD
WOW, I WATCHED THIS WHOLE VIDEO AND IT WAS FUNNY AND GREAT AND JAIDEN IS SO AWESOME...weird, no idea why I felt the need to say all that...Anyway, awesome video! I hope you have many wonderful D&D adventures to come!
Ok so I completely remember this from a while back but I can’t remember if it was on jaidens channel or if it was on alpharad’s.. either way it was awesome..
This video is amazing you should make another video like this 😊❤😂
I was anticipating the acid breath from the hug, and you didn't disappoint. Absolute gold.
Mark finally feeling true love again, his eyes being flooded with tears of joy Jaiden- PROCEEDS TO ACID BLAST HIM IN THE FACE
This video was awesome. Dnd isnt my cup of tea but i definitely would love to watch more of your campaigns in videos
that vox machina reference at the start :00
So basically my campaign started liek this.  "You're a lone skeleton in town bone" That's it. My dm refused to elaborate
This was bloody glorious. lol Man, I would be *So* down to see more D&D stuff from ya, Jaiden. I hope you have some fun stories to tell someday through it. :)
brought this video up with a friend and he put d&d the best way ive ever heard it described: "a lot of people think that d&d is this like epic giant game of thrones thing where the characters are super complex and theres a lot of moving parts but in actualitly its more like monty python where its a group of like 4 idiots doing random things until it just stops" this coming from somebody whos never played d&d, and to be fair i only have twice
Anybody catch the two Adventure Time references? Real throw backs. 10:11
Luap? Swap the letters and u get paul!!! Woooooooo!
There needs to be way more animated D&D sessions, seriously, thank you
I couldn’t help but notice multiple cartoon shows being referenced (Also absolutely loved the video)
...This feels like somebody used a _Mad Libs_ game as the campaign's sourcebook.
Masterfully done! Truly a great first campaign.
Jaiden’s sheep voice reminds me of hilda.
Turtle 🐢  is the answer!!!!!
Expecting new episodes as soon as you get them ready! Hoping to see this get to the number of episodes of Dingo's Fool's Gold campaign 😁
Short story, if your playing dnd with Jaiden, don’t piss her off, you seen how brutal she is
AHHHH THIS IS SO GOOD. THE CARACTER DESIGNS AND MY FAV YOUTUBER DOING DND  May the algorithm treat you well
why is alpharad so cunty looking in the thumbnail
ye
we need a vod of this
6:53 had me cracking up 15:07 ex wives can be dangerous
You should play a browser game called kingdom fo loathing
oh god, the fact that jadens character just casually casts depression on mark was so funny!
VOX MACHINA 🥹
I appreciate the re-enactment in story-teller mode. But let us not forget that promptly after the wand breaks the team heads out to see all the animals and realizes that Paul Jr. had not been the only human transformed.
About paranormal order when?🤨
should have named him turt reynolds
The mario and luigi music is epic
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD-
Simply delicious, d&d is the best game period, change my mind
Claim your "I came here fast" ticket here  👇
Amazing!
I loved this video! We need more!
I'm sorry,  but Paul, he is just the best in combat and my personal favorite. So sorry, but not sorry.
What do you think the answer is Paul Jr? P Jr: ... tah- T-Turtle! >:c
Have you ever seen a top comment and was like “damn, I wish I commented that”
I really hope you are able to make more videos like this
@1:17 I found your Vox Machina easter egg.
First of all, I love the fact that you played D&D with some friends and had a really good time with it. Secondly, am I the only one who feels bad for Paul Thompson? Third, 12:36 is the best part by far.
Yes we have added another soul to our obsession muahahaha, have fun!
Since now, Jaiden has went from storytime to Pokémon to Vtuber and now D&D YouTuber. Quite a dynamic career indeed!
My first time playing DND I was a bard. My DM got so tired of my crap that they banned me from flirting with inanimate objects. I told them I'd tell great grandma piss fingers (my character's actual great grandparent's name)
Jaiden I'm a big fan for years!! The video was awesome but honest feedback having alpharad and ranboo play the part of the their characters would have improved the video. It would make each character more distinct and you'd still be the main character and narrator! Anyway your content and your team are still awesome, keep it up!
More D&D please!
I usually like jaiden videos but i think this video is mehh it should have included more voices of alpha ranboo and slime
I love that everyone that plays has the one story from a campain where their character gets to be the ultimate badass.  Mine is from my first campaign. We were fighting the BBEG, which was a lich, and the pace we were fighting it was basically a circular room with a bottomless pit in the center. One side was blocked, and ot immediately used wall of force on the other side to block our party's 3 martial characters from reaching it. I was the only caster/ranged attacker as a sorcerer, so I ended up having a magical duel with this lich across the pit, with me hittong him with the highest damage spells I had to try and get him to lose concentration, couterspelling, and cannibalizing my lower level slots for sorcery points to get higher level slots back. Eventually, the DM got frustrated and cast banishment on me. He looked up, ready for me to counterspell, but forgot that banishment is concentration. So I just said, I flip him off and tell him to have fun. I was out the rest of the very short fight as the three very annoyed martial characters absolutely annihalated it. Good times.
Fairly accurate for dnd
Dnd=😊
Alpharad looks like Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.
13:06 was that an undertale reference?
GUYSSSS THE QUEEN POSTED!!!!👑
I'll admit, I was expecting a TPK.
Ranboo looks like Garfield LMAO
the vox machina reference was cute
Love the Vox Machina cameo!
Point blank acid breath to the face is a move I'm gonna be using
Hell yeah! Jaiden picking my favorite class even, tho I also... have never played DnD before XD
I think that Paul was a human barbarian, Bartholemew was a tabaxi bard, and jaden was a dragonborn rogue I think.
Oh man! This was as hilarious as all other D&D videos that I've seen are. I just lost it when Mark Tompson got acid blasted in the face and then Charlie and Ranboo's voices came out laughing.  I've unfortunately only ever played Pathfinder with my siblings. Still as fun and funny though. I do wish I could do D&D.
A NEW POST?!?!?!??!
Let’s be honest. Every dnd party has that *one* person who try’s to seduce everything, from a normal villager to literal Satan. No one is safe.
I absolutely love that jaiden has proven via this video that dragonborn, indeed, can have tails. Absolutely love it
I like how over half of this has absolutely nothing to do with D&D and is just general fantasy roleplay, probably largely freeform
I love how the door is kind of like the door from adventure time.
Love Vox Machina eating in the bar.
4:33 - Bong water
1:12 vox machina refrence :O.
Da fuk?
Please make more D&D videos!
I started jumping when I saw Ranboo drawn in the thumbnail
You are a really great youtuber
:D
When she said Slimecicle, I just though of, " Colonel Cornelius Cornwall"
"So long gay Bowser"
The whimsical _Wind Waker_ woodwinds were a nice touch for the score for this video.
I love how Jaden‘s character designs are always so heartfelt and very cute and just good overall
Oh my gorbino its Randal booth great great grandson of john wilkes booth
Seeing Vox Machina in 1:15 really surprised me. I love this easter egg
She would be a great dnd animator
Jaiden and Ranboo are furries and Alpha is kinning Larry. We love to see it.
I once made a character that only hated Dragonborn’s. That was his whole character.
ok i dont even care if its animated or not I need more of this d&d squad and their insane advantures
Ok I love dnd so much and I’m so glad that YouTubers I love are finally getting into it it jus shows that the game isn’t ending anytime soon and it jus makes me so happy
0:56 Larry
deltarune but awesome
7:16 mario&luigi superstar saga!
d&d the place whete you can a furry without hell
God the DEPRESSION screech killed me
They put the worm in a jar
IMDB calls it "Wacky" and "Fun to be a sheep". This was a steller story time video
Please do more of these, I absolutely adore this and laughed so much
MORE PLEASE
Heartless, heartless woman.
Welcome to quite possibly THE greatest hobby in the world! Congrat's, too... You've found a group that "gets it"... Totally unhinged and no wrong way to play the Game... JUST lean into the weirdness for an epic FUN adventure... haha...       Wish you all the Best... and can't wait for another installment!!!   ;o)
This is a fever dream
Alpharad is just Larry. Lol.
Are you familiar with the cinematic movies?
✨"dEprEsSiOn! *✨
Damn, that was savage how you manipulated Mark like that Jaiden.
I love Wild Sheep Chase! So happy to see you finally trying D&D!
I think everyone should have the experience of playing any TTRPG, not specifically DnD. I gotta say that Slime is really creative with the story, which I always lack in. Would love to see a session 2, but the main thing is that you enjoy it jaiden.
Was this a one shot?  Aw it ended wholesome
Random thought I had during the video: One piece as DnD would be so fun especially with everything up to current stuff in the manga
Omg if you turned into a DND channel overnight your internet clout would double or smthn. This was the funniest, most unhinged animation I've ever seen and I really want more now
Have you heard of the D&D session, Fool’s Gold?   Just search up Dingo Doodles and you’ll see that it’s a pretty amazing story full of comedy, drama, romance, violence, lore, and one the main characters is a cursed monkey 🐵
Just remember rule one of tabletop RPGs: Fire solves everything. One time my vengeful halfling convinced a town of religious zealots to burn down their own town because a drunk guy was rude to him. The army coming to besiege it were very greatful, and confused.
We need a sequal in 2026
Don't think I didn't notice the Over the Garden Wall reference at 4:33
THAT WAS SO GOOD IM DYING!! Holy this was perfect.
I appreciated the reference to Mr. President/Coco Jumbo from Jojo.   Now imagine if they could just... go into the turtle?
This was the fastest D&D campaign I’ve ever seen. 😉 iykyk
TTRPGs can be fun, we have one going on our main channel (personal account here) and love hearing people's stories from games. Glad you enjoyed your first time playing DnD.
Love that you put the crit roll gang in there
1:50 Alpharad be having a kira monologue
10:40 is that an adventure time reference? (I mean glob was already pushing it)
I like how the tavern gets worse and worse as each second passes.
Love the vox machina at the bar :p
I’m a monster, so what would’ve happened if I was in Jaden‘s position is instead of point-blank blasting him with acid breath as his wife I would’ve convinced him he was a failure at every level as a father a manager everything and tried to convince him to commit suicide, and then I would roll with advantage from depression. 😂😂😂 I’m not a good person.
One time a few years back my friends and i played dnd lite basically lol the setting was current and we were just ourselves but we did use dice probably from like an app or something and it was just a quick little practice game basically cause we had never played it at all . We broke into this dudes corn field and ended up getting chased into his house and i think he hhad dogs attacking us too if i remember correctly lol one of us died and 2 of us made it out after killing the farmer and that was the game lol it took like an hour maybe. Now were playing baldurs gate
Amazing cameo at 1:15 well played.
Now I'm sold in playing D&D, I just need the game.
Do you know Mark?
I love the dumb horse from adventure time being roasted in the background xD
OMG the Critical Role reference tho.
9:54 hehe adventure time reference
This just makes me want to join in a DnD game even more now
why are we not talking about how alpha's character looks like Larry from pokemon SV
Loved this 😊 do another pls
I wanna try dnd aswell and all my friend wanna try it to. Be we dont know how and when I search up on internet its all just so confusing and complex. So Idk if I Will ever be able to try it. But this seems so cool!
Ah yes, Force feeding animals clay
Wont watch content with ranboo, wish you all the best :<
This video was amazing! The story the animation everything made it a master piece
this is the best start ( hopefully)  of a jaiden animation animated webserie :) this was so entertaining.
Ranboo being stuck in a timeloop as a cat sounds like the most ranboo thing ever
crown possessing someone?? magolor reference?? from from kirby return to dreamland? real??? fr¡¡????
This is the definition of words hurt Jaden screamed depression.😂
I love this I never played this game and this wants me to play so bad!😅
Jaiden is a true menace for being savage at the end
My critter brain was triggered by the Vox machina in the opening
This is the best video by far, as I am a huge D&D fan.
3:25 I’m pretty sure Sue’s a wild magic sorcerer based on what just happened 🤣
It only makes sense for Alpharad to play as a human fighter
Ayo, Dragonborn, Nice Choice!
We need dnd part 2
"Answer me these riddles three" I thought the next lines were going too be, "And I shall allow entry unto thee." But what really followed was much better and alot funnier. My old DM probably would've done the same thing but we would have probably had to fight a metallic dragon for failing a single riddle.
OMG THE CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE IN THE OPENING SCENE AAAAAAA
Congratulations on trending!
welcome to the roleplay rabbit hole
This is exactly the kind of shit I play D&D for! Sounds like you had lots of fun! I sincerely hope to see more videos about your escapades into the fantastical soon!
Bro, the vox machina reference is fire
15:29 Honestly I would have just kicked him in the nuts but I love Jaiden’s idea a lot better. XD
Is it bad that i know what the spells casted were?
I love This pleas make more 💎✨💙
I see DM's (Dungeon master's) as the chronicler of the game.  Wouldn't mind seeing more Dnd  stuff in the future.
Pogg
Cat Ranboo and Lizard Jaiden deserve headpats with those designs.
I love how alpharad is a copy of larry
wtf hahahahaha Vox Machina right from the start XD
5:21 I’m such an idiot I literally just thought it was the subatomic mass of an atom because “A-Z” is the formula for that, is that weird or awesome?
Nice im happy you played it
The best things about this video:  -Jaiden meeting ranboo  -jaiden meeting charlie  -bartholomule  -the music   -the story  -the comedy   -jaiden being a dragon born   Overall, it's bloody brilliant ❤ /p
Damn my games always end up really racist
Well well well, if it isn't a fun and easy way to farm content!  Love these kind of D&D story videos.
Thank you for the great content Jaiden! Keep up the fantastic work!
Such a wild first adventure.. meanwhile, my first (and only) time I played DnD way back in hellschool, we simply tried to climb a mountain, all fell to our death, and went to chess club instead  Also, I like how Jacob is just Larry from Pokemon
The moment he realized that he was tricked
STOP WHY DOES PAUL LOOK LIKE DRACO MALFOY!?!?🤭
love how the characters look
Please do more of this kind of video 🤩
Why is it that playing D&D automatically turns you a professional fantasy novel author
Alpharad as Larry from Pokemon is hilarious.
I WISH TO FIND SOME PEOPLE TO PLAY D&D WITH SOMEDAY
THAT WAS SO COOL OMG!!!! I would love to see content from the actual sessions at some point! :D
I see this as I’m actively working on She Kills Monsters
Only thing i’m worried about is that i wouldn’t be fun to play with
Odd1sOut and Jaiden on the same day? It doesn’t get better!
Talk about a one shot haha. In the game session I'm currently in, my party and I woke up a sphynx by accident and the sphynx is crazy and believes they are the sun God. The Sphynx teleports us out of the catacombs we found it in. And then decides it wants to destroy all the undead and evil beings that have taken over it's temple. Which depending on the person makes sense right? But the thing is, the town we are currently in uses the catacombs as exp and money making. It's why the town got created, so we are freaking out and decide to chase after it and the sphynx ends up making us it's disciple's 😂. Wish pissed off some of us because we already got Gods we follow. Sunday is our next session and I can't wait for what happens next.
LOVED the video! I'm DMing a group of my friends-curious if you might consider giving tips?
Ranboo and Charlie is the most chaotic duo in the world
Oh yeah I recognize some of these highlights talked about on Twitter
I love how DnD can be both completely unhinged, absolutely ridiculous, and totally epic all at the same time.
In a campaign I’m playing (bless his soul) dose to understand money. We robed a bank and 4 of us got 500 PLATINUM EACH!!
No way you posted this while I was at the beginning of my school's new dnd campaign. Mine was super boring tho, The dm planned for a party of 11, but only 4 people showed up, so the enemies were absolutely absurdly strong and it took us 2 hours to beat a trio of goblins. Didn't help that I didn't have the dragon I usually have with this character since we started the campaign at level 1 instead of level 3 which is where I've always started them. One of my friends did fuck a goblin tho so that's something
I'm really into D&D as an experience... wish I had someone to play with. It requires a bit of commitment really. I think the idea is cool.
Not vox machina being in the taverb
That was... wild!
The fact that Paul's dressed like larry from pokemon scarlet and violent is just chef kiss
im also DRAGONBORN LES GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That sounds of the chain
Jaiden dragon beast Bartholomew the cool cat  Alpharad business guy named paul his wife be dead,parents be dead and he plan to leave to get milk but paul jr gets the milk and never return As you can see a totally normal team here
This video was funny and great and Jaiden is so awesome
It’s a good day when Jaiden uploads 🤌😁🤌
16:55 I cant believe i didnt see that coming
damn, i play a Cleric in my game, and have access to the Command pell, but I didnt figure you potentially could use the word Depression to do something like this. gives me ideas for other single-word commands that are possible.
Dnd in a nutshell.
Yes more please. Collab with James
i knew this would be a good vid when i saw the frickin Vox Machina party
gotta say i love the mario kart wii sondtrack in the background  also love how zoot is just a non binary creature of chaos who also end up kinda being the hero
SORRY DID I JUST SEE A REFERENCE TO VOX MACHINA???
IF THIS. DOES NOT BECOME. A SERIES. I AM GOIN TO SPAM LIKE THIS OVER AND OVER CUZ THIS WAS GREAT HELL YE
I MADE A DND GAME!
I saw the sheep and immediately recognized the oneshot XD
15:21 crap I laughed harder than I should’ve here
Wait, was Paul a Barbarian who used their dead-end job as a source of unlimited rage?
THAT WAS AWESOME!!! I'm very excited to see how my campain goes considering we spent the entire first session trying to open a few doors.
Age 6? Bruh
The Critical Role cameos in the tavern! Jaiden really is a woman of the people
hey jaiden ima make a puppet from ur charetor
I have a shorter story, me and my party were resting after killing the queen to the king who killed the big bad that story based one tapped us about a week ago, when we were supposed to stop the transformation of party guests into $4000 wine that was probobly only actually worth $5, anyway we were resting, we woke up and found a large, heavy, scaly blanket on us, we pushed it off, and another fell on us, we pushed that one off, and another one fell on my guy’s head, so he grabbed it, and bit it, that’s how we started a fight with a hydra
*A Dragonborn....WITH A TAIL******. HERESY
this is that best video ever I need more of these videos
Alpharad in the Sanji cosplay
As an Avid D&D fan i find this to be absolutly hilarious and amazing! thank you so much for animating it and ty slimecicle for DMing it!
Greetings;  I have enjoyed his work for a long time, however I am unable to use monetary support;  therefore, since I have been a dungeon master for some time, I would like to offer to create a personalized dungeon and dragons campaign or oneshot.  obviously free of charge.  good luck for the future
an ANIMATOR sharing their DND CAMPAIGN literally kill me right now(/pos)
Thats so great. The group I played with sucked. For my first "move", I tried to turn invisible and throw something to distract an enemy. Never even got to roll. Just killed me and I stayed dead for the next hour-and-a-half of the session. I've been pissed at D&D ever since. Such a sh*tty experience.
OMG the nostalgia when the Pokemon Ranger music started playing
Lol, that' looks like the horse the ice king dressed up as
Continue the campaign
I would have LOVED D&D as a kid, but now that my imagination is basically dead I only like seeing others play it now 🥹
YES! Jaiden found the Infinite Content Glitch: DND Sessions
Jaiden, that has got to be the most psychologically messed up attack ever and I love it
ngl it was a calm first session
Pls make more d and d vids
Anyone else notice Vox Machina at 1:15 ??
As a D&D player, it is VERY fun
I can imagine Charlie screaming ITS WORMIN TIME
I just realized that I could’ve done an adventure time dnd.
I knew it was suspicious when Charlie asked Jaiden if she played DND on her episode on Chuckle Sandwich
I'd be super excited for more Jaiden DnD videos! This video was already super great!
16:10  "YOU'RE MY PERSONAL HELL!" This line went so hard
I like that Legend of Vox Machina reference at 1:15
dnd sessions getting animated is truly a gift to society.
In one group, my barbarian with no arcane knowledge is the designated potion identifier. We have a wizard, It's just funny when I make up potion names based off the DM's description of how it smells.  One time it was bottled blade.
I WOULD 200% WATCH A VOD OF THE GAME IF YOU HAD IT
There is the smart player and then the real dumb player and they are the same thing
Why can I just imagine Slimecicles voice cutting in when ever something happens
The Vox!! I know those guys. Also ye old mart of wall. 😆
I love how Jacob just turned into Larry 💀
Funny that u made Jacob look like and act like Norman from S&V 😂
Ahhhhh this was awesome!! I've always wanted to try DnD and this has me so hyped to finally jump in!
Jaiden would be the perfect wife.
I just started getting into dnd this year. I am so happy that one of my favorite youtubers is also playing it now. Please do more of these!
SHE LITERALLY USED CHARMDI, PROCEEDED TO USE SEXY DANCE, TO THE MEGIDOLAON THE SHIT OUT OF HIM
HOLY SHIT
Jaidens character just being there for shits and giggles was the best part
U sick monster what did mark do to deserve any of that? I mean what specifically?
Wild sheep chase! This was the first thing I ever DM'd! It's so much fun 😁
meh
does anyone know the music used in the inn?
So much Mario and Luigi music in here.
This was amazing
I love how the only bit from the streams I was able to see what jaiden COMMANDING SOMEONE TO HAVE DEPRESSION. 10/10
Cant forget that jaiden was actually in a contract with the devil
Damn I'd love to see a video on your time at cosmos kitchen
When she cast Command: Depression I started SCREAMING. IT WAS FUCKING HILARIOUS! And I want to try it hahah
9:00 Thats some headcrab vibes right there
This looks so much fun!
Finally jadian uploaded
LOVING the Vox Machina cameo in the animated intro for the campaign!
0:59 "The clouds part over a vast lush forest innit??" 🇬🇧🤭
Petition for Riddle Door to appear in more future Jaiden videos.
THIS WAS THE BEST VIDEO IVE SEEN FROM JAIDEN ANIMATIONS CAT RANBOO IS ADORABLE
14:44 This was f---ing hilarious. I hope there is more Jadien playing D&D videos in the future. This video is fulled with hilarious scene to hilarious scene. I loved watching this video.
._. What was that...
Best strategy to get in close to your boss character opponent: command them to be sad as he'll, pretend to be the thing that makes them happy, and vomit an acid blast Kamehameha point blank to da face. If it doesn't kill them in one shot, improv!
Loved this! would love to see more of your sessions! very funny
im already subscribed. but i thought that bit at the beginning was hilarious. nobody thought it was weird i promise 😂
U chose a dragonborne?!? Shouldve been a Dwarf
9:52 The eyes were too dangerous to be kept alive.
Nice vox machina reference
My dnd club dm used a similar story
Anyone else catch the Vox Machina easter egg in the opening tavern scene?
OMG ALL MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN ONE VIDEO?
They really just committed goblin genocide without a single bit of care
The most functional of DND parties; The carefree one, the depressed one and the probably insane one
I just loved the characters  Idk why but the employee and the cat remembered me a lot to Tom and Matt lmao
Holy shit it’s happening
DnD seems so fun :D I remember watching some parts of stream like the transforming into the wife part!!
Jacob IS just Larry
Bro alpha literally made his character lary from Pokémon 💀
This was an absolute blast to watch. Thanks for animating your crazy adventure!
FINE I will get DnD.
Over the garden wall reference :D
that was a great game session!  Congrats and welcome to the ever growing DnD family : )
am i the only one who noticed mark looks like broom stash from Explains almost ran over by a car video
seeing vox machina in the tavern just shows how much of an impact Critical Role is in this community
Hold up mark should be used to depression since they are a Walmart employee
This some good animation there.
RANBO OMG COLLAP
I’m a minute in and I already plan of making fan art of all these characters
Zoot pulls back, just a bit just to look into Mark's eyes which are sparkling with tears and proceeds to ACID BLAST HIM POINT BLANK FROM THE MOUTH.
she sounds like shes going through puberty lmao
it's kind of funny how Jacob's D&D character looks like Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
NOW THAT'S D&D BABY!
You single-handedly reinvigorated my love for D&D!
Best grp of weird people ive ever seen in a dnd game
Can you upload an entire campaign to one of your channels?
What happened to John jr
Omori music
My dad is teaching me and my brother how to play dnd and it is fantastic also we have the worst background story ever   Also is it just me or does Paul look like Draco Malfoy 😭
MORE. I NEED MORE!!
You should do more D&D! This video was an absolute masterpiece!
WTF IS THIS QUEST??? REALITY MUCH ANYTIME SOON???
I'M LIKE 4 MINUTES IN AND JACOB'S CHARACTER IS KILLING ME
That was fucking AMAZING
I bet the D&D was fun but keep up the good work. ✌️
Vox machina were in the tavern, obviously an adventure was bound to happen
I can't wait to Zoot up for another campaign with these characters!!!
Paul design is legit awesome omg
8:25 that was the sapphire dragonborn’s breath weapon
Do another
9:51 i swear thats the adventure time horse.
1:16 Oh hey nice critical role reference. I approve~
I loved this vid!
This is the most unhinged D&D video 😭😭😭
Ive always wanted to play DnD, bu	t i have no friends :(
YO LETS GO ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS PLAYS DND!?
I like how Jaiden totally spoke like what ranboo would say at the start.
Some of us will remember Jaiden/Zoot's little Danny Devito-sounding shoulder devil bird who got turned into a short naked man at the end by the wand, which is the full reason the wand ran out of magic
this video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
This was a great video, if you play more dnd with them, pls make a new video lol
so cool id be happy to see more of such adventures!
Jaiden as the dragon is my new favourite thing  Her expressions are ON-POINT!
I have hit the peak of YouTube content   Both Jaiden animations and DND   this is the best thing that could ever happen to me
I love you made Alpharad look like Larry
MORE!!!! I WANT MORE!!!
I really want to try d and d bc I've always wanted to try a role playing game!
I love dnd. I love the things people do in it. But I wouldn't really go out of my way to play it
THJISA WAS SO FUCKING GREAT
What class was jaiden I wanna start playing d&d and it looks interesting to be able to curse someone like in jujutsu kaisen
Honestly I'm going to start playing dungeons & dragon's now
I love how every dnd story I’ve heard has fantasy corporation, Craig’s list being a list of jobs made by Craig, Fantasy Costco where all your dreams come true Deals Warlock included, and now I have chaotic evil Wal Mart
I hope you animate more D&D adventures! Love your content!
Dnd is one of my favorite games, and it's always been a way for my dad and I to bond We have sessions regularly, but even before we started playing, there was always the dragon obsession He's been playing much longer than me, but I'm glad he shares this with me :)
The riddle door has got to be the most comedic thing i've ever heard
this is the coolest shit i've ever seen i am so hyped that Jaiden's into dnd definitely make more of these!!!
That was hilarious!!!!
Why was this so good???? Plus not even 5 minutes before watching this my dad was talking to me about DND!!!
Jaiden as the dragon just gives me serious NCS vibes
can't believe jaiden canonically has a fursona now
I love the over garden wall refrence at 4:15
It's worming time
Alpha is just role playing Larry's life.
Yeeeaaaah! I love dnd and this was an amazing video. The internet could always do with more dnd animators.
This really makes me want to play dnd but none of my friends like it- cant waut to see more
Wen i first played dnd i was the dungeon master
THAT'S THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME
PLEASE DO THIS AGAIN
Next time add porky
Jaden, I love Danny so much and I would love to do that move and I have the same idea but with charm person pulling them in as if I was going to give them a kiss pushing them away and then casting level two hell is rebuke
If you think D&D sucks i genuinely think you have a mental illness like you can not play it or like but like no one can deny its great
LEZGOOOOOO   Jaiden in cellbit's rpg next year
Love your designs for the characters
That's a nice one shot
“… she's going to acid- yep, that's jaiden alright.”
We need more DND videos!
I haven't actually watched the full stream or anything but Charlie seems like actually the best person you could possibly have as a dm tho. Like his ability to have a plan but also go with the flow of the party members and change things while keeping things funny but also still genuinely good seems like it'd be really good, and it really comes through in the storytelling.  Also Alpharad just being straight up Larry is hilarious.
A DND story I will never forget is when someone seduced a wall. Not a mimic a plain WALL! Lol DND is hilarious.
2:04 in, i love this
This was great!!! LOL
AYO?!
I love Jaiden as a dragonborn
that crown thing was so much like ranboo/dream lore in the dsmp lol.
By the way, I think you should play the last three months for pizza tower no reason
Yo jaden loa means saliva in philippines nevermind i saw the captions that says lop not just small name for sheep but we filipino can still do my best
Epic
That was actually so sick, I loved it so much
This was phenomenal!!
Stoooop!!!! You made me spit out my coffee while I was waiting for the grocery store to open! Now I have coffee on my shirt!
Love that Jaiden's character is a dragon born with a magic circle on there tongue. 😂
Que paso 😔
I NEED PLAYERS FOR A DND CAMPAIGN PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASE
hi jaiden
I thought you were gonna suplex mark
This is such a fun session! I’ve been playing DND a lot this year, since we have a strong community at my school and a great technical director who is obsessed with dnd as our adult. I’m hoping to dm this year because I love telling stories
The reveal of "Luap" being the reverse of "Paul" was awesome! Props to Charlie for making a really good campaign
Yeah, that sounds fun... but I can't subscribe because I'm already subscribed.
2:45 YOU JUST GOT COCONUT MALLED!
4:14 damn! Never knew *the beast* was a fan of dnd!
What system did you guys play? Also, great video!
6:50  this made me laugh
1:46 into the video and just gotta say, Paul isn't the assistant manager at "Ye Old Mart of Wall" because when we see "y" in words like "ye", IT ISN'T MEANT TO BE SAID LIKE A MODERN Y. IT WAS THE DIPTHONG FOR THE TH SOUND.  Edit: I loved this video so much and it was entertaining trying to figure out the Nat 1s (although not difficult, it did make me laugh)
that was fun
1:10 KEYLETH! KEYLETH MY CHILD
Love how Paul is basically Larry
SHE HAS FINALLY HAS JOINED US!
Okay so hear me out. Play a monthly session and just keep doing these. I would pay money to watch your actual D&D sessions but if you're not interested in doing live play, just keep doing these please. This was amazing.
Omg this is the best story ever bro
I hate mark he’s keeping me as a janitor because I bumped into him 5 years ago
one time we killed a child
Would love to see more of these, its fun!
It is honestly wild you hadn't played D&D before, so welcome to collecting math rocks ya sketchy goblin.
Really enjoyed this video. I enjoy those crazy campaigns where the DM is creative and allows for equivalent interactions.
Charlie and Ranboo absolutely flipping their shit over Jaiden acid blasting Mark in the face while Jacob’s character just stands there is so fuckin funny, oh my god
Jaiden- Suddenly, a sheep crashes through a window and starts rampaging round the inn. Me- Heh...ram-paging...
Jaiden's character was just susie deltarune
I too recently played dnd I was a warrior arocockra
Monty Python anyone?
15:20 “My wife died”  *acid blasts his face*
yay!
Umm, if the door can turn them back, why couldn't they turn the sheep back, could've ended the game faster lol. Awesome storytelling and animation as always Jaiden.
My group’s DM is running a procedurally generated island hopping campaign for us. Apparently this session and the last were actively planned, though, because we weren’t on an island, we were in a whirlpool Mario DDR style. One of things about the islands is that they’re not scaled for our levels, but no one’s died yet. Or no one in our party, rather; a beloved npc became Ultra Super Dead, like even if he was resurrected he couldn’t be, because he got attacked by a lich and ended up with negative hit points. Maybe he wasn’t beloved, but he died saving our asses, and he was a civilian kenku youth, who had been betrayed by his village, who he ended up dying for.
Does anyone know what the song at 8:10 is, swear I’ve heard it before but i cant put my finger on it 😭😭
WHY WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT IN EATING THE CLAY
I was expecting the timeloop to play more of a role tbh. something like how the wand miscast had caused it or something...but other than that. satisfying~
we need more d n d 😤😤
One time my friend pissed on a dragon so that his electric power would be more effective. He rolled a d20 and killed it
Larry is Paul’s brother
THIS IS SOOO GOOOOOD!!!
This was hilarious I couldn't have expected a more on brand DND adventure XD
0:38 LMAO EVEN I WAS CAUGHT OFF GAURD XDDDD   Like this only if you're subbed to Jaiden 🤭 ↓
please another
I loved that!
I visibly pogged at the thumbnail
4:33 bong water  refrence
So cool 👏🏿 I didn’t get to see the whole thing so this was awesome
Hi  I love your vids
I’ve never played dnd, but I’ve dm’d it… I’ve done that for 6 years… im a forever dm. It’s quite sad really
I saw what you did with the Adventure Time Poo Brain Horse.
omg! yall started with the module I played through just recently! Awesome! Or at least with the initial hook!
jort
You gotta play more dnd to animate
Paul is an absolute chad. Getting absolutely beat up, getting dragged along a quest, and somehow surving
" I miss my wife Zoot, I miss her a lot, I'll be back" - Mark Tompson
This was a peak recent jaiden video for me! That was a fun watch!
Once again, Jaiden has made another great video.
Is there an actual recording of this I would love to watch it
I was wating for this for 3 weeks moooooooorrrrreee😢
God this story, was such a blast from the past.
This is such a cool video, Jaiden! Totally worth the wait since the last one. I’m glad you had fun!!
A clay worm saying "It's wormin time" is such a Charlie DM moment
guys i’m not even joking i promise you i just dm’d this but with different names I SWEAR YALL DID GREAT I LOVED THIS :D
Also just guessing out of the blue: we have a Sorcerer dragonborn, human fighter(?) And a small Tabaxi bard?
I can’t believe jaiden acid blasted him point blank after pretending to be his wife. That was amazing
Wait... I did not even thought that Luap was a backward name for Paul JHWJAHHJHAJHJWHAJJHA
really like the mario kart music
This Video Was funny and Jaiden is awesome
Ahhh... early D&D games. So good!
today is a great day because jaiden uploaded. this is a lovely video jaiden! i loved the jokes and this video made my day XD amazing animation too as always! i remember when i followed you, you only had 7-8 videos uploaded and i would rewatch all those videos waiting for a new upload XD you’ve come so far!
8:58 lol crown of madness, that's good if it was improv'd
Cool, I’m gonna go play Skyrim.
This is the best thing ever
Omg i have dm'ed this exact oneshot for my party once!
Badshit insane
I don't know if anyone noticed, but Jaiden put on the Masked Dedede theme from I think Triple Deluxe at the clay puzzle.
Paul is the goat 🗿
Loved it!
PLEASE DO MORE but longer
Been playing for about three years now, it really is good fun as long as you have a good dm and lean into the stuff that might seem cringey at first, because if everyone is cringey then no one is lol.
Anything that comes out of Charlies or Jacobs mouth will never not make me either laugh way too hard or make my ponder existence. The fact that You and Ranbo where apart of this only makes it better. I love all four of you and the amazing content you put out. Cant wait to hear more DnD Stories!!
We need another
That was AMAZING
I was laughing SO MUCH watching this- this was genuinely one of the best videos I've seen ever in my life I will think about this constantly
My first game of dnd    My party tried to kill me with fireball on purpose wile we were facing 3 orks I was half ork I failed the saving throw so I’m supposed to be dead but the DM gives me one last round he expects our cleric to heal me but he heals the wizard that almost killed me and the both ran Of course I look like I have no hope but I can speak orkish join the orks and they heal me fully and now I am a leader of an ork warband that controls The Who continent and my character will be a future BBEG for other characters
I was so surprised when she said Ella. Then I was like, what does this say about me? as I look at the dragon with a bob cut. (My names Ella)
I really enjoyed it. I hope you make more D&D Videos.
hey it's Lrary from pokemon
THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE LMAO LOVE IT
Technically the alphabet backwards is correct dont give riddles with multiple answers
Will they take the worm to go fishing?
In fourth grade, I was in D&D club funnest year of my life
Jaiden was brutal in this RPG
The Jaiden maneuver will undoubtedly go down as the most powerful and forbidden attack in DND history
8:22 my favorite part was when the worm said "It's wormin' time" and wormed all over the place.
i love windwaker music. <3
Please make this the next fools gold it would be awesome so hear about the full campaign
That was cool!
I’ve only recently gotten into a campaign myself and have had fun so far
Alpharad is just Larry from Pokemon SV, change my mind
Yknow, it only just donned on me that this story in D&D is about a Dragon without wings, a musically-inclined cat, and Larry from Pokémon trying to get a sheep back to its human body.  Sheesh, maybe I should get into D&D if it’s this wild. Might be a lot of fun
I couldn't understand the door riddles!
6:20 I LOVE that this worked, but almost didn't work o(>t<)o
jaiden spesial attack: DEPRESSION
Super unethical but super fun to watch and I have play d&d before and it is really fun. :) hope you enjoyed it
I like how Alpharad looks like Larry from pokemon Scarlet
Me realizing Alpha 2 is just larry
I played D&D one time at school and I don’t understand anything that is happening in this video, except for the anagram as I play Undertale
I SAW THAT VOXMACHINA REFERENCE I SAW IT  WOO
YES, FINALLY! D&D!!!!!
this is so entertaining, i really like this video style
That was lots of fun
Paul kinda looks like larry
I love this! 🥰
This was awesome
Heh... Ya buncha murder-hobos...
Dude, I love every animated version of Charlie so much, I’m so glad Jaiden could have him as a DM. And all the characters are amazing, I love them so much!!!!
sorry description, rolled a nat 1
Opening with Vox Machina? A+ move.
i love paul, hes just so done
Love it ❤
Loved this! I remember the 1st time I played D&D, of course I played alone, with just my cousin as the DM 😂 lol still pretty fun tho! Hope you do more videos like this! Love your art style  ❤
CATBOO IS FUCKING REAL ONCE AGAIN HOLY SHITTT!!!!
Going insane what is the song at the end of the video 😭
Today was literally my first time playing too! LOL
This is fine,I like this no we like this
This is fine,I like this no we like this
This is fine,I like this no we like this
This is fine,I like this no we like this
This is fine,I like this no we like this
This is fine,I like this no we like this
This is fine,I like this no we like this
it feels so weird hearing about people playing for the first time but i find it impressive since your so imaginative you picked it up so fast
This is fine,I like this no we like this
this is amazing the ending made me tear up no lie 😛 15:27 16:05
Zoot pretending to be Mark’s wife was so sad- why was it so sad?😭
I saw Ran's character and thought "Why is Ranboo a furry bard?"
This was INCREDIBLE IM SO HAPPY
I Love everything about this!
Splendid
So good! Love dnd
The moment I saw the clay I thought: My party would eat it I was not surprised when that is what happened
We need more!!!
this is nothing my first time i rolled a natural 20 on seduction while my teammates burned some bandits alive
I heard about that "ex-wife" story and was looking forward to seeing it for the entire video. It was as good as I hoped!
I love D&D
I’ve been seeing so many clips of this so glad one of y’all made a video
5 HOURS AGO?! IM NOT THAT EARLY BUT THATS EARLY FOR ME
i had a friend who had super good charisma stats and so every time we came across an enemy she just slept with them and it carried us the whole time lmfao
Shout out to the critical role cast at 1:14
Team attack makes me want to see Larry and Laup attack goblins Superstar Saga-style.
jaiden done made a damn anime (please make it into a anime)
that D&D for ya'll  fun campains  and Fun Pcs  :D
The fact that I literally had a conversation about DnD the other day and TODAY, due to that, was looking into DnD and how to create a character and what I should know about the game and all that, AND THEN I got the notification that you'd uploaded this IS HONESTLY KINDA SCARY BUT COOL!!!
0:26 Shrek 5 is coming soon everyone
Alpharad + Larry (Pokémon) = Paul
I feel like all the characters suited the youtubers perfectly
Paul reminds me of Larry from Pokemon
Why is alpharad larry?
I actually remember being there for the end part... god that acid blast!~
moew
At this point im convinced jaiden and alpha rad is like ash and pikachu. Cant have one without the other haha
Omg ONLY 5H OLD!?❤❤❤❤❤
I respect the commitment to the story but I wish you showed more of the conversations you had with each other
this was soooo much fun to watch
Well, now's just a matter of time before Jaiden's channel slowly slides into another D&D campaign animation channel, and I'm all for it.
Despite you having never played DnD before, acid blasting Mark as his wife was a veteran move.
This is actually awesome, you play dnd like a sociopath
WILD SHEEP CHASE SPOTTED!! This was the first session I ever ran!
THAT WAS GREAT!
Loved the Vox Machina reference. An attack involving depression, a beer gut as a defense and pretending to be Mark’s ex was brilliant. The “How do you want to do this” was firing Mark…Luap = Paul… geez
1:25 I am a huge fan of Dragon Borns and Kobolts! I’m so glad she decided to go to this route!
4 trending on gaming! Congrats!!!!!
Eyo I recognize Vox Machina anywhere
Very off topic but does anyone know the music that starts at 16:30?
Why didn’t you eat the clay?
yooo so cool to see jaiden play dnd
Omg I love dnd hope you enjoyed it
OH MY GOODNESS HE USED THE DOOR PUZZLE. Slimecicle is my new favorite dm I am sorry Felix you have been dethroned. Edit: This is easily my favorite Jaiden video ever made. It was so good! and I would love to see more.
I loved this so much
PLEASE MAKE MORE OF THESE OH MY GOSH I LOVE THIS SO MYCH!!
TURTLE INVENTORY!!! The bongos are the best
Dragonborns are cool people.   Normally l use human. But l use druid too. some people just straight up say that l like being my beast form. On the end l just like druid with a double beast build. So you think. Yeah definetly he likes druid. l like that build because it makes the druid a all rounder. When l wanna go support l go with human. Attack l go with werewolf and if l wanna take a good look at my surroundings l use a owl transformation.    The part l dont like is how people think druids are furries
i like the character designs
I’m literally trying to learn D&D now ❤
This was an hilarious and amazing video. And this changed my perception into a whole new level! I see it more as an crazy medieval story brought to life with your imagination and come up with insane scenarios to come to life in your will! I wasn’t interested in DND before and now it left a very good impression on me and now I feel like trying it myself! I hope we get another amazing story fro you and your Friends! Plus seeing Alpharad as a bored man with a suit and a sad backstory really sends a message about his personality lol. Your character was pretty fun too and Rambo was it? His character was also pretty cool too! (I’m a sucker for cat characters lol)
I love that Jaiden's oc looks like the Ender Dragon XD (Also can someone make a list of the different music played in the video? I wanna vibe with the ending one)
The moment the sheep showed up I got hit with massive nostalgia for the first time I ran that module
OMG Jaiden you uploaded this video at the perfect time cause I literally just joined a D&D club in my school yesterday. I cannot wait to play it with my friends. I got my character and his lore ready for a game!
Reminds me of the time my party let me shoot the moon...  This is one hell of an introduction to DnD tho, congrats.
I love how Paul is just Larry
Animated DnD is sooo cool! keep it up!
This is absolutely *UNHINGED* I CAN'T BREATHE 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ain't no way Jaiden was a non binary dragon 😂
I've noticed a reoccurring theme of worms throughout this session...
having CHARLIE SLIMECICLE as your dm for your first game of dnd is the coolest thing ever
I always die to a tree
omg the way you wreck that emotional moment was so unhinged and funny¡ (in good!) 😭🌨️🏖️       The characters design was so cute gqjwushs, probably ranboo has some reference, but I only feel from alpharad a vibe of Larry with Zoro??? 💫 (don't mind me, i'm not good vibing(¿) haksjdns)
Alpharad being Larry is just chef's kiss
Quality one shot
it's WORMIN TIME 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is there any place where can we listen or watch the season? it would be awesome
Man i gotta unsub :(
this was incredible. great job all of you!!
4:15 the fact that a popular animation youtuber made an Over the Garden Wall reference has peaked my day thank you
sequel needed
THE HORSE THE HORSE   THEY KILLED THE DERP HORSE
I've seen an animatic of the boss showdown, it was a hilarious crime against humanity so I'd love to hear the other highlights of the season.
This was awesome! I think that a live/preimere IRL DnD video would be cool for you to do!
I LOVE D&D
Been watching for years, but never subscribed cause you never said to, now I have lol. Ask for the things you want.
Critical role cameo hehehehe
Why does paul feel like larry from scarlet and violet
What anime is this
ok but paul 😻
WHAT A STORY 👏
I wish my first D&D session was half as fun. Well done. ^.^
Peep Vox Machina in the background!
PLEASE PLAY MORE OH MY GOODNESS HAHA This was a joy to watch and it makes me want to get back into DnD so badly!!! All of the visuals were phenomenal as always, the characters were so fun and the segment with Charlie and Ranboo losing it was hilarious!! Everything was hilarious aa!!!
yay, another member of dnd also this video was amazing i loved it ps paul looking like larry is almost a perfect description of him
Of course Jacob's character i just Larry xD And *FINALLY* the Disguise Self meme gets to be in a video!!!
I think they referenced the half life head crab at 8:52
Holy shit that was so good!!!!
I love how you can just tell that Charlie DMed this campaign, especially with the way the door speaks and the names of the goblins
You sure did dungeon some dragons out there, Jaiden.
Jaiden I need confirmation, Is the way you animated alpharad's hair a reference to larry from Scarlet/ Violet. I could see the connection instantly I love Larry lol
noice
I loved it
First time is always amazing.
You should totally stream dnd and post vids about it if you don’t already
Alpharad using jaiden for thumbnails and now jaiden does😂
This is hilarious 😂
I have a hand full of D&D stories, but the one I love and hate the most is that the hornyness of a player resulted in a universall collision fusing worlds to create the merged realms
For anyone else who didn't get Luap's identity until it was literally spelled out for us.... yeah.
I love these kinds of videos!!!
My party are murder hobos. Enough said.
dnd podcast based on this when.
im quite the adventure time nerd and i remember this horse goblins cooking
I wanna play D&D but I have no one to play with
Jaiden using a spell and calling it "DEPRESSION" got me dying
I’ve played D&D before and What happened Is We got thrown off our boat and One of us fucking drowned
I’ve never clicked on a video faster
ANIMATION LADY DID THE THING THE DRAGON THING
15:25
THIS IS THE MOST FUCKING CHAOS IVE EVER SEEN!!!
I love all of your characters!
i’m a little surprised jaiden didn’t choose to be an aarakocra rather than dragonborn. both are perfect for jaiden tho.
What class is Paul?
Im 13 seconds in, but is paul just a blonde larry from scarlet and violet
I knew you were gonna Acid Spray Mark the moment you pulled him in for the Pog Champ hug
Omg I've been dreaming of a JaidenAnimation DnD video!!! The art looks amazing on this btw. Also I could've imagined Jaiden to play a Kenku LOL
So,Are we just forgetting about the time loop thing?
Bro my Dungeons & Dragons stories are infinite and there all incredible
I love how Paul and Bartholomew had these deep intricate backstories that got woven into the story and Jaiden was just like DRAGON ACOD FIRE MOUTH SHOT
okay but how did a Speak With Animals scroll level a building
Yo Id love to watch more dnd one shots with yall. that was fantastic
Omg play Baldurs Gate !!! Lol
Something about the animation reminds me of Matt Wilson's Bonus Stage.
9:52 THEY COOKED ICE KING😭😭
Me seeing the thumbnail: RANBOO?!?!  Edit: just watched all of it it was so funny in the end I LOVED IT😆
Alpharad’s character is the most Alpharad character possible. Truly incredible
This might be my new favorite jaiden animations video-
MY TWO FAVORITE CONTENT CREATORS PLAYING MY FAVORITE GAME????
no way! i was watching this yesterday LOL
My DM, I was a animal tamer, and during the run, I had been saving my gold up because of there was a healer in our group who knew I would go head first into battle. Well, during our run, we found a secret cave and went to explore it. One was able to find that the cave was lived in and we decided to wait for it outside. When it showed up, the idea was to jump the person and steal his weapons and armor but what really showed up was... a Dragon. Panic was on the table as we knew the plan wouldn't work when I took a chance to see if I could be friend the dragon. The role wasn't very high but I was able to get the dragon on our team by handing him over a big bag of coins and basically, easily beat the Dungeon Master who, oddly, never thought the Dragon could be won over like that.
9:52 ITS THE ADVENTURETIME HORSE!
I remember seeing 14:08 in its raw form, and it’s just as unhinged here.
Based on the dragon above, I'm guessing the journey's not over.
I was watching the video with the subtitles on and at the end it said "big thank to Charlie Ron buu etc" IM SORRY BUT RON BUU!???
your art made this story so fun !!!
If you told me when i was younger that Jadin Ranboo AND Charlie collaborated, i would've imploded right then and there.
I love this.  An amazing presentation of a fun campaign. Every bit as ridiculous as it should be.  I can't wait to see more.
And now Jaiden has made it to the world of animated D&D storytime vids. This is beautiful, and we need to hear about another session, because this is GREAT!
NO WAY I JUST PLAYED THAT STORY LIKE THIS WEEK
as someone that's been playing dnd for almost 15 years now, when you started eating clay and throwing sheep around I thought "yeah, that was a dnd game alright"
HELL YEAH
Paul is my new favorite character
1:14 *Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme*
Gotta love that Alpharad’s character art is just Larry from SV with a battle axe in his briefcase.
i like d and d
Is Alpharad's character supposed to look like Larry lmao
Man i really needa play it now
This was amazing, please do a second session and animate it again-
More plz. This is amazing!
ooo this seems like a modified version of wild sheep chase! i ran it before for my table and it is an awesome fun introductory adventure.
5 hrs ago… not bad
I love how Paul is basically Larry from Pokemon. Best character ever!
I loved this. Would love to see more like it.
(:
Please god upload more stuff like this! Also great music choice and i loved how paul was designed after larry awsome touch. Gud shit👍️
loved this
this video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome honestly I loved this so much lmao
Dragonborn = best species
a very cool game
The retaliations between this and the last vid are OUTSANDING
Jaiden animations dragão?
I'm sorry but that emotional bit with Jaiden turning into Mark's ex wife and then acid blasting him in the face? This might convince me to play D&D
I love this also Jacob as Larry 😂 . Jaiden please do more things like this
First Jaiden became a Pokémon YouTuber, and now she’s entering her D&D YouTuber arc.
I love playing Dnd
love the adventure time reference
4:15 The Beast is upon them!
This was a masterpiece
9:51 NOT THE ICE KING 😟
adding in the laughter from the dnd session was such a good touch
I didn't know how people played D&D before, and now I'm even more confused
I want more d&d video this was awesome
So many cartoon references...
I like that Alpharad's character is just Larry + Battleaxe
The story is slightly changed to fit into a video better but to include that many details is still very impressive.
I wud bi a dragen born as well but with wings
I love how obvious it is when either a 1 or 20 is rolled
OMG I needed this video! My fave YouTuber and my fav game!
wait is ranboo’s character still in the loop?? 😭😭 amazing video btw! makes me wanna try dnd 😼
Infinite content glitch.
1:40 - 2:02 literraly Yoshikage Kira
Please play Stardew, you don’t have to make a video you can just stream it. You would probably love to have krobus (the shadow demon) as your roommate.
Pretty standard session tbh
yas the animation vids are back!
LARRYYYY
That was amazing. XD I really love these animated storytelling recap videos.
Fun spell: tasha's hideous laughter
4:59 That was definitely Charlie speaking there
9:53 that horse won’t stop staring at me when i try to sleep
The fact Jacob is Larry lmao
This was so fun to watch! I love like all DND related stuff. And it being animated just makes it so much more fun to watch!! Awesome job to the animators!!
What happened to paul jr the turtle
This is probably unintentional but seeing as how Vax is not in the tavern with the rest of the VM it implies this is them at the end of the campaign.
sticker star music for the credits based
Jaiden and Ranboo, two of my favorite content creators, iN THE SAME VIDEO
Jaiden finding out she can tell vast amounts of stories with her dnd sessions
One of my PCs have a habit of eating random creatures to try and get their abilities and fails every time on rolls at this point he eats them to eat them
Great choice for campaign one shot for new players. It’s weird and fun enough to get most people hooked.
Yayy Jaden!! Glad you found a good DM and some helpful players for your first time!!
I hope to play someday too 😭😭🧙🏽😊
14:07 depression👍
12:17 I can't thank you enough for animating such a write-off scene because you deemed it funny in your head
Are all DnD Sessions like an Acid Trip???
I love dnd! Eating the clay was my first thought too... dragonborn players and their impeccable logic, amirite?
at one point i was in a campaign dm’d by my boyfriend’s dad & i turned into a carpenter ant to sneak into carcosa because joe’s mother (joe is a pc) was being used as a vessel to resurrect the king in yellow (the eldritch being) & alduin (another pc) killed joe mamma cuz they needed her alive to perform the ritual, which is why i needed to steal her hair so i could reincarnate her.   dnd is wild
By god you’re a…… dragonborne
you have no idea how much serotonin seeing your art team bob their heads to the beat of the music gave me
man dnd looks so fun
16:01 ROAR OF DEDEDE
Wow, you gave him depression, love, a hug. Then just tried to spay his head off with acid, what a thrilling twist
How do i find people to do this with ?
Omg, I needed this video so bad.  After the news and media this week I just need some light hearted funny content to watch.     Thank you Jaiden, perfect timing
This was one of the best videos I’ve ever seen pleas do a part 2
Oh my god, this was like a entire campain. They met the villian, heated the Gillian and got Paul jr back.
This was fucking amazing, one of my favourites from this channel, also love the inclusion of the adventure time horse being roasted by the goblins
Larry!
Bro that acid blast was very predictable but god was it funny
Jaiden PLEEEAAASE play Stardew valley!
8:22
I played D&D
We need Paul jr plushies
Wait, is Tholomew still stuck in the time loop though??
Our party is Odkin (lizard folk,fighter), Ellie Hollow(human, wizard), Brother Ambush(rabbit folk,druid) and me Citrus Juice(kobld/little fox dragon thing,cleric)
Yes, yess... More popular people finding and falling in love with TTRPGs
I loved this!! This kicks the DnD movies booty!
Hope you start a series oof these kinda aof D&D Adventure. totally prepering my pop Corn for this.
Sequel NOW😡
I want more
Ive been Afraid of starting my Dnd journey but im starting rn seems so fun
please make more videos like this like exactly like thisss !!!
All these Zelda songs are amazing choices for the vibes of the video
i like how you used the bongo controllers to open the door
Aws :') (as usual) what a great animation and plot you bring today¡!
If she wasn't played it already I think she would have a blast with danganronpa. She would get very attached to charecters...
Make a part two
YESSSSSSSSSSS
w
This was absolutely amazing. Please do more!
0:57 First: Jaiden made  basically a carbon copy of my current character in a campaign I’m currently playing 2nd: cool axe bro 3rd: RANBOO CAT RANBOO CAT AAAAAAA
Omg I absolutely loved this, and I would like to see more adventures from the funny little group!
Okay, I need to ask: How many other people wanted to utter the "Oh, Hi Mark" line from "The Room" whenever Mark's name came up in this video?
I've played DnD before and it was surprisingly fun I'd join u guys 😂
interesting
why Paul look like Larry from Paldea?
7:10 ah yes. The Bing Bong approach
I thought of an attack where my stinky feet was an attack. Is that weird?
I love D&D games ,,,🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Okay so. Bard. Fighter. I cannot for the life of me tell what Jaiden’s clsss was. But that’s bc I’ve only done bard ranger and paladin.
I think she uploads every two or three months so can’t wait to see a video in December a.k.a. Christmas time
57 seconds in and i realize im not the only one playing dnd for the first time as a dragonborn(i assume its blue, mine is also blue) with a friend who is playing as a tabaxi  seriously im in the dnd club for the first time at my school and my character is a blue dragonborn and my friend's is a tabaxi
9:51 i’m prettttyyyyy sure that’s an adventure time reference (horse thing)
I LOVE DND AND ANIMATION DO MORE DND PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Dungeons and drogons is fantasy , just like furry they mostly like simping for factional characters alot,by the way are you a furry yes or no(I'm a anti furry)
1:15 Nice critical role reference! Also, the absolute chaos that this was, is pinnacle D&D.
i knew this was gonna be chaos from the fact that charlie is the dm
ok how is the full context of the wife thing even more psycotic then the first time I heard it so on top of emotional manipulation you forced him to have a depressive episode
When the sheep showed up, I grinned, recognizing that plot-line. And then... it went places I never would have believed XD Brilliant.
I played D&D for a while in college.  Crazy times, including the time we were fighting a dragon and the dragon threw one of our characters across the room.  Oh yeah, in hell, by the way.  Our battle cry was: “LETS GO DIE!!!”
new favorite youtuber
My best way to describe ttrpgs, especially dnd is: they're every video game that has never come out and that has come out that you never have or have never realized that you wanted to play.
2/3 characters being enbies is such a welcomed small thing lol
Well. S2 please?
You have loud bones
Damn  I real gotta get into dnd now
I’m in dnd at school and it is so fun when you do it with friends
I'm not just saying this cus the description said to, but this was funny & amazing & I loved it!!!
Good video, I like.
Uhmm why is paul so fine?😶‍🌫️
BABA WAKE UP JAIDEN POSTED
Wait I LOVE this new kind of video! This was so fun to watch! Keep it up!
That was incredibly violent and unhinged.  So, typical D&D session. Good work!
this is exactly what dnd is supposed to be
16:50 caught me DEAD XDDD
Haven't played before, but this looks sick as fck. Going to look into it
Paul is the assistant manager at ye olde mart of wal’  😭😭😭
Need I say that she basically gave Rambo a fursona
XDXDXDXD 🤣 more, that was so funny
We need a paranormal investigation rpg version
Something I would recommend is having the other party members being voiced by their respective players. Would make it a lot funnier.
My adopted in-game child got trapped in a bag, and I threw the person who did it into a tree. (LOT of stuff happens in our game)
You know it’s gonna be a good day when both James and Jaiden upload.
Puffin Forest has a new person to meet and work with lol I always enjoy those videos
HAHAHAHAHAHAAAA THAT WAS SO FKING AMAZING LMAOOOOOO
You should play savage worlds its way easier to understand and a less elitist fanbase
Jaiden fits right in with every dragonborn player giving their characters tails.  I 100% agree with that decision though, lizards of any variety don't look right without tails
Give a man depression, pretend to be his wife, embrace him, and cover his face in acid.
This was so good. I've been playing d&d for years, and to see some of my favourite content creators playing a game that I hold dear while having an absolute blast makes me so happy.
Dang Vox machina drinking at the old oak inn.
that was a very weird version wild sheep run
Ah nothing like your first D&D game/Campaign, mine was called Lost Souls and started with the Party sailing to explore a new continent disappearing into a Red Lightning Storm and arrive to where the lost go... How did it end? Well my character ends up accidentally killing the creator god and destroying the entire universe. That Halfling still has the biggest kill count out of any PC's to this day 🤣  Share you stories, let the Chose flow!
Why is Paul blonde Larry.
Persona 5 vibes❤
I feel compelled to make an Argonian modeled after your DnD character now lol; speaking of Skyrim, I hope you'll get a chance to play it one day!
An amazing adventure!! Loved every bit of it
This was fun to watch, man now I want to try dnd
This was epic damn
why are you guys making feel bad for mark before killing him dawg
So this is where the Chuckle Dungeon went
Was that a dragon
Animation is super inspiring and really good
Aw, man! Cool! I host x4 weekly D&D shows online and we're super small and growing. Maybe one day I can grow my show big enough and high production enough to get folks like you on. : )
I love you
More!
I was the DM of my campaign,the campaign is fine the only problem is that one of the players have a tendency to always roll a nat 20 which did made balancing the campaign really hard. I was only able to balance the campaign out by putting dragons in almost every encounter. ( Really great video, a masterpiece if I say so )
Omg I love this!
the critical role reference in the beginning made me pop off this is truly the d&d video of all time
If I ever get the chance to play a character with Command again, I'm stealing the depression thing.
There's something so fun about the trauma dnd causes
PLEASE DO MORE
This stream was HYSTERICAL and I have been WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO
YOOOOOO picked Dragonborn hell yeah
3:38 why does the sheep's design remind me of Dragonsheep studios???
More. Ty please
What to do? „I AM GOING TO VOMIT!“ ~Rick May
I just appreciate the Mario & Luigi Super Star Saga Soundtrack in the background. Brings back memories.
0:55 Ah, yes Furry, Scaley, and *_Larry_*
You should try playing code vein, its 2 player.
This is pure chaos and I absolutly adore it.
jaiden please make more vidoes
With my DM we had a goblin rouge themed one shot where our names were Gab Geb Gib Gub and Gob, and I had a pet fly named Gyb. My pet fly allowed me to distracted a guard and do a double critical hit kill on him. Good times
I love the concept of D&D, sounds fun and everything, but thats very complicated that game and you need to have time for that and a group and there was always one of those two missing T_T at least i get to taste it a bit with Baldurs Gate 3.
YOoOoO Vox Machina reference that is incredible 😂
I looooooved ittttt❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
i love dnd!!!!!
Hello, does anyone know what song plays at 7:05?
MORE!!!
One time I paid honey heist (similar to dnd) and it was perfect until it was 11 pm and no one could handle my style of humour anymore (this)
10:05 Ah yes, that weird horse costume from adventure time, such lovely detail indeed
Finally a video I’ve been craving Jaiden content but I do understand Thai stuff takes long
ohh new vid
This was so great! I want a whole campaign
DND more like dungeons and dimwits that’s the name of a video not this and is that slimecicle
DND ARC LETS GOOOOOOO
This was the best thing ive ever seen lmao, now i wanna play
This was one of your best videos yet totally worth the wait
LMAO ALPHA IS JUST LARRY
That was awesome. I wouldn't mind seeing more like that. I was totally rooting for the point blank acid to the face by the way lol
THAT WAS SO SICK 🤩
I just  This feels like a first session in the best way possible AND ALSO RANBOO’S CHAR IS SO WELL ANIMATED
I kinda wish you got them to voice act their characters
“Who is just disappointed at this point....” Is the most I can relate to at work myself. 🤣
I LOVE this.
if you do more of these, it'd be really fun if everyone voiced their characters themselves
Ranboo as a cat was so cute 💕
I also play D&D and this was time with my party we entered a cave and there were these huge rats and I decided to blind him but that just made them more angry but we did kill them and one of my friends after we killed the rats ATE THE RATS
YEAAAYEAYAYAYAYYAYA
OH NOW I KNOW THE CONTEXT TO THAT ONE CLIP ABOUT JAIDEN AND MARK OMG LOL
DO I HEAR TEAM DIM SUN OIL RIG MISSION MUSIC OMG JAIDEN THANK YOU ❤❤❤
That was super cute!!!
I dm for pay, and this is exactly how d&d typically goes. The ultimate goal of the players isn't to win, it's to make the dm sigh wearily.
muy buen video y sesión de d&d, un grupo disfuncional y funcional a la vez, muy divertido :)
I'm actually going to start a one piece themed dnd and I'm playing a standard game and going to in a Jojo themed game where I'm the jojo
1:20 The Ocarina of Time theme was literal perfection 😂
nice, reminds me of my first dnd session, we had to save a NPC from goblins, only one was left alive holding a knife at the NPC, i managed to convince the goblin to join our team for this was his best options, the second he joined us my buddy backstabbed him, my character screamed at him telling he wanted to kill the goblin.
It’s funny how the characters are unfazed by normal attacks
MORE, I MUST HAVE MORE!!!!!!
That's an excellent session!
this is amazing, keep making more.
I play dnd and I forgot my character sheet once so I had to attack a monster with rocks as my only weapon 😂
Whoa that is crazy, I also started DND this year and also as a Dragonborn and I agree it is super fun!
The Larry-fication of Alpharad is a wild journey
This is a amazing masterpiece,  The way you just acid blast mark is hilarious and I really like the character designs. Alpharad looks like Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet. I really like this video nice job :D
Noice
Kinda sad that alpharad and ranboo didn't vice act
Paul reminds me of gym leader Larry😂😂😂
One time I was at school and my friend invites me to a dnd club and I always thought that it seemed really cool so I got into the club though its been years and we haven't met up for it yet \("/)/
I remember watching this during the subathon, crazy it's been almost a year since that lol
Jaiden has this gift to make the coolest shit even cooler
4 hours after post
THE DEDEDE BOSS FIGHT MUSIC IN THE CLAY FIGHT??? That’s perfect.
that sounds so fun!
No worms were loved in this video
I would’ve loved to see the session they had with everyone’s voices and reactions. It would’ve been so much fun.
This is objectively the best video you've ever made, thank you Jaiden, it made me happy
Yah dnd is fun and I regret doing this but in dnd I got not sober and proceeded to have not family friendly relations with a scentaur who is a queen and now I owe child support.
I’m watching this 20 hours before my very first DND campaign - I hope to have just as fun an adventure as you did! PS - I’m very surprised that you didn’t choose to be an Aarakocra
So  You're an animator A Pokémon fan You've come out as Ace and are now therefor LGBT You dabbled in Digimon a little while ago Started playing DnD -- and more specifically as a Dragonborn  So... have you settled on a species for your fursona yet?
The art looks ADORABLE, I'd love to see more, especially cat ranboo
11:16 foreshadowing
"you shouldve aimed for the head" -thanos
"Paul solongaybowers the ship" just killed me !
ngfhjhgjh  ive never played dnd before and watching this is really making me wanna try it out!! :33 this video was rlly good sorry
Unbeknownst to them  Up in the sky hidden by the thunderous clouds of Nimbus  A giant flying shadow casts its gaze on the party and debates ur fate
Me and my friends ran a Pokemon dnd campaign and we rolled d100s for the starters and I got a perfect nat 100 and got a shiny chimchar
Wasn't Mark the victim then? LoL
Alpharad being literally just some guy is peak Character in dnd
Paul = Larry ?
the expressions in this video killed me 😭 Paul looks like he’s been from hell (9-5 job) and back
oh god imagine this party doing spell jamming.  they'd Fucking Love the Space hamsters
I also did this recently, cool first experience.
Oooh, I recognized the adventure the moment the sheep popped up.
Yep, this is dnd
this is the best Dnd game I've ever seen.
Yum clay
Immediate 10/10 for wind waker music.
I love that Jacob's character is just him cosplaying Larry from Scarlet/Violet but with an axe in his briefcase.
It's so good!
MORE D&D STORIES ❤
1:15 SHE WATCHED VOX MACHINA :D
D&D scares me mainly because my 10 year olds creativity is going crazy
This was great!
Why does Paul look like the paladian gym leader
16:54 "OOOOOH"
step 1: make this a full campaign step 2: film it and post it on youtube step 3: profit like seriously, this being a thing would make the world a significantly better place
Happy to hear other game story jaiden you made day feel great love to see more 👍
honestly them eating the clay made me laugh so hard bc that was my first thought 😭
My friend once killed an ogres mom and dog, used shocking grasp on his lower area... and then stole all of his money. Being the DM can be so hilarious and freaky at the same time. And no the ogre didn't survive. It died from that attack.
at my school theirs a d&d club and my friend joined then said that you can be whatever  you want and my other friend said "can i be a flower" then me just like "you role a 20 you grew 1 more inch taller " the next day where walking down the hall to get to class and i ask "can i be a chair" and then "you role 20 beam attack"
You just made 2 of my favorite things come together!!YESSSSSS
5:22 the fart sound 💀💀
NARRATION VOICE: “My addiction to dnd festers in my conscious as I recognize the Wild Sheep Chase oneshot module”
I never thought I would get to see all my favorite creators playing together
Love this, I love how ridiculous this is, I love Zoot and her design, this whole thing was a nonstop banana show. Hope to see more soon!
this is so wicked sick?!
I absolutely love this video! I'm a dnd fanatic!
Is Paul just the scarlet and violet gym leader Larry?
I think I've seen a previous animation of the Mark moment & it was funny yet horrifying
HERE BEFORE 5000 VIEWS
So long a bowser is crazy
Omg! I love that Alpharad is playing Larry in DnD XD
Woah! That was amazing!! I really want to try that game at somepoint, it looks fun!
god i love how you just made paul blonde larry with an axe. he really is just that.
I think I recognize the base one shot adventure, I’ve run it a few times myself! It’s about a poly morphed mage who’s apprentice turns him into a sheep and you have to turn him back with the wand. So cool seeing how Slime adapted it!
I am proud to say that I am here before the video has reached 1 million views  Also great vid Jaiden I love the animation for this vid. Idk why but it feels just a bit different
Obsessed with this
You just had to throw salt in the wound saying everyone you know plays while me over here I am searching and searching and trying;-;
You should do a podcast like the stinky dragon. (Stinky dragon is a dnd podcast btw)
I remember the "Disguise self vid" XD
Dragonborn good choice
D&D is i dont know boring if all is linked to imagination then everything can be solve with the phrase "im invincible bythe power of thi magic dragon ball blah blah" the game is linked by the limitation the players gavf to it and that means that if the player use their imagination there are no limitation therefore everything that happen dont make any sense.
HAHAHA YES CHARLIE SLIMESOCLE. NEW VIDEO ADDITION MY COLLECTION. VISCOSITY HEIGHTENED. SLIME YOU LATER
The sound effects are a really nice addition
What’s the name of the song that plays at the end
I mean if you want to plz do this again I love d&d so maybe a part 2
I think at 10:15 the horse on the grill is James Baxter from adventure time but I could be wrong.
paul was the goat            ...the zebra i guess
I would LOVE to watch more of this content!!:D
Another amazing Jaiden Animation video
PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE I LOVE IT
Missed you jaiden........ also ummmm........... INCREDIBLE!
Alpharad is just Larry
We need another one
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE VIDEOS, JUST- EVER! I have been watching Jaiden for years, and to see her create a video about a D&D campaign (I adore D&D) she's in with Ranboo and Charlie (my two favorite streamers) made me SO happy- This entire thing was altogether hilarious and perfect, and I hope there's more on the way!!! :D
Hiuiii
Yeesss i love D&D
Yeeeeees Jayden your back I been watching your videos since the beginning
This is the absolute best D&D story I have ever witnessed
Uh, excuse me, what the actual F is this masterpiece
This had a better plot than half of video games
I'm glad you enjoyed D&D. Now that you've got a taste of it I strongly suggest you try out Pathfinder, especially 2e which is very similar to D&D but some difference to give the system it's own identity. I recommend it because having played both I feel like a lot of people would probably really like Pathfinder but are often worried about trying out new systems, and also I think Pathfinder is able to make so many more cool and crazy characters with all all the options it gives you while not overwhelming you with it. It also has the advantage of not being made by a company that sent the literal *Pinkertons* to someones house over a missunderstanding. So that's always a plus.
Hi jaiden 😄
i am stealing the animal with the scroll of speak with animal idea....
”You're an irredeemable monster”  Jaiden: ”What took you so long, idiot”
the entire interaction with the door had me rolling
This was a trip from start to finish, and why did I know before you would that you were going to attack the BBEG the way you did? I could see it coming the moment it was set up.
Slimecicle did a crazy job as a dm, you can really tell how chaotic this party was and how his improv skills shined through during the clay parts. Giving your players so much freedom and having to work their creations into enemies like that is difficult.  Also i applaud his able to tie the story into each characters backstory. You can tell he really cared about his players and their experiences.   I love these characters so much. I gotta play dnd soonnnnn
I wish dnd I could play with YouTubers.
I saw the clipped part of the whole acid blast thing what feels like a year ago and when Jaiden said "Disguise Self" the damn flashback hit me like a truck
I love this one shot. It’s such a popular intro for new DnD players that are looking for something a bit less serious
epic
is it just me or is alphared literally  larry from sv
IS PAUL JUST A LARRY REFERENCE??? HOLY SHIT I AM AT MY KNEES
First
My friends got me into dnd and our sessions are so fun
Oh my god Jaiden play dnd this is amazing
YES YOU GINALLY PLAYED DND MAN UES
This will come with a large side of fan art, i just know it.
D&D is about imagination. so i can imagin friends too play it with😂😂😅
Ok but the real question is if Ranboo's character escaped their infinite Groundhog Day situation
Is Jacob meant to be looking like Larry Or is It just me?
Paul is the incarnate of Larry
This was a super good video!
ah nothing better to start a dnd campaign with *fucking genocide*
I remember watching it unravel in real-time during the subathon and laughing my ass off at the clay part and the end😂
I love how Alpha's character is undeniably just based on Larry
6:57 this killed me
Bro Paul and Larry could be twins
You haven’t played D&D until now
welcome to the best past time ever.
So so good😊❤❤❤❤
Legends of vox machina hello?!
this k8lled me lol i need to try playing D&D
Alpharad is an assistant manager, and all i can think about is how i can now call alpharad The Ass Man
I love all those character designs I'd be down to see another one
Commanding "DEPRESSION!" is certainly something I'd never think of ahahahah T-T
Isn't thalemeul still stuck in a time loop
9:52 Adventure Time reference
I love how Jacob is just drawn as blonde Larry. THAT is a DnD character of pique design.
Hehe, the Adventure Time horse
I loved this. I wanna try playing now!!
1:42 oh my gosh I only JUST realized it’s platinum blonde Larry 🤣
This one time my friend …”slept” with a duck
I need a series of this so bad bc I love this and btw great art
I've seen your stuff before and I've really enjoyed it! I love your art style and your animation is fantastic! But if I can get more stories from this particular group of psychopaths I would be a life long fan!
do more dnd !
Cringe
oh i hope you do this more often. this was great.
This is the greatest crossover that i didn’t know i needed
I would play D&D with this one friend and he was really good at making it sound fun,  and I’d love to tell you the first bold and brave thing I did was lead my friends to a great start…………………………………………………………………………………….If that’s what actually happened, the first thing I did was accidentally set a tree on fire 😐🔥
Welcome to the big D20 family where the question is not “Why?” but “Why not?”.🤪
I love how alpharads character design is just Larry from pokemon
This was the single greatest thing I’ve ever seen
Yep that's a dnd game if I ever seen one. Is it wrong that in one of my games I kept a rock as a pet.
A truly iconic duo: an excellent artist and storyteller and a game of D&D.
That Vox Machina reference rtickles my fancy
I USE MY CHARISMA STAT TO SEDUCE THEM.
This is now my new favorite video also Paul is just Larry from scarlet and violet
this was amazing
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT I RECENTLY PLAYED D&D FOR THE FIRST TIME TOO?
My first DnD session happened a couple of months ago. I had a goblin named Bug for a one-shot and by the end of the one-shot, Bug ate a mushroom that gave him Autism 2. (I am autistic and the DM rolled for the severity of the shroom)
Really nice to hear the Superstar saga and Sticker Star music in this video 👌
Peak television
15:28 I feel so sorry for paul
I love that Alpharad's character is just Larry from Scarlet/Violet.
welcome to the DnD fandom, your stuck here now.
legends of vox Machina??
That Vox Machina reference ToT
Bro the best dnd I ever saw
love the over the garden wall references with the turtle lol
I love this
If I was playing D&D I would be a frog who can obliterate anything When I roll the dice, whatever number it lands on, that's how long I obliterate
Dungeon master gave me tobmuch access to oil needless to say I became an arsonist
"and we start eating the clay"
YES, CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE FOR THE WIN
I need more omg!! ❤
This was literally like a tv show episode I  Hope we see more videos like this.👍
PLEASE DO MORE THIS IS SO GREAT
"Turtle. Turtle is the final ans-    IT'S A WORM"            Comedy gold
Pls make more D&D videos thy are so funny
love how Paul looks like Larry from pokemon
Wow this was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome!
YOOOOOOOOO
As an expert homebrewer, I too absolutely love it as well
And now I wish I'd gotten into D&D
I love how Alpharad is just... Larry. Beautiful
THE LEGEND OF VOX MACHINA REFERENCE OH GOD I LOVE THIS
We NEED A FULL CAMPAIGN, JAIDEN!!!
I saw the over the garden wall and adventure time references
OH EMM GEEE YIUR PLAYING D&D<3
NOOO NOT THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME
NO
Anyone else want this to become a series?
I like the vox machina reference
This is great I would love if u did it again
Man got dragoned
alpharad relly just made larry from pokemon, the normal type trainer.
Was starting to think you forgot about YouTube.
0:57 dragonborn with tail? Awesome :)
What a masterful clutch strategy Command - Depression Spoussal impersonation Point blank Acid Blast  *Chef's kiss PERFECTION!
Amazing! Would love more DnD shenanigans 😄
a
YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
L A R R Y
Me and my friends started playing last week, its very epic being the DM
Is Paul a reference of Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet?
The first game of D&D I ever played had the school Satanist at our table, and he treated the game like Grand Theft Auto with imagination and dice. He killed several villagers and hanged his executioner with the noose meant for him. We never got to the Sharn in Eberron because a Satanist ruined our campaign, he was everything Jack Chick feared.
my campaign let me seduce a dragon. I crit his asshole with frostbite.
how do you like a video 10 times?
Awe the character designs are so good I love them
I did the thing you said. Hope it felt weird. 👻
This this is Great Keep up the good work 👍
Vox Machina in the tavern is SO CUTE AGHADFGSLF
Paul is definitely inspired by Higuruma from JJK and or Larry from pokemon S&V im 100% convinced on this
I can't believe alpharad plays D&D where he could literally be anything he wants but chooses to roleplay as Larry
It seems like an unspoken rule that someone's first dnd character is a dragonborn. Mine, my friends, jaiden now...
Good youtube channel idea:  A channel that animates dnd adventures, could even make them a series   (Is this actually a good idea?)
Love the Larry inspired character on Jacob’s part.
This Video was so much fun to watch!!! I hope you can make more videos like this in the future❤
Paul looks like if you mixed Larry and Draco Malfoy
Let's go jaiden and odd1sout video in the same day
As a young DM myself, I can confirm that this is the least chaotic DND session I have seen yet  also my bro Jacob really just turned himself into Larry :skull
Ah Classic stupid Dnd one shot which you can find like as a first link while looking for Dnd one shots
not first
14:51 I literally started dying-   *Ella is my nickname*
I love how Mark is a magical Walmart manager it's Fucking HILARIOUS
Man, that blowing up the tree scene reminds me of the time in my short dnd campaign when I accidentally set a forest on fire with Burning Hands. Don’t worry, our cleric put out the fire.
.
When your DM puts in considerations for peaceful negotiations for all encounters, but the players all choose violence...
2:04 did you just mix Yoshikage Kira and Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet together?
LOL THE ACID SPRAYING IN MARK'S FACE
I knew I was a puzzle master I heard z to a and just laughed "it's zebra" lmao I guess I am a true forever DM
Paul reminds me of Larry from Pokémon
What's up with all these Walmart D&D campaigns?
Tell me why alpharads character reminded me of nanami
Hey wasn’t this a few months ag- OH
As a 4 year DM good sesh and storyline recreation maybe some live game play with y'all I DM a large group it would be nice to see others play
A JaidenAnimations and an Odd1sOut video within 5 hrs of eachother. WHAT
"Enjoyed" would be putting it lightly, that was an absolutely epic and stellar! (Hinting back to the video you created when you wondered why no one used the word, "stellar". If you remember the video, you're a real one! ;3) I'd love to see more animated campaigns!
We need an official party name for these silly little guys
OH MY GOD THIS WAS AMAZING I FUCKING LIVE TTRPGs AAAAAAAAAAAH  ZOOT CASTS DEPRESSION  RANBOO BAGPIPE ANXIETY KITTY TIRED CORPORATE DAD WITH AN AXE  SO BELOVED
as a dm for a few years i gotta give huge props to charlie for this. the adventure was spectacular and had a ton of hallmarks for an amazing session. the adventure was simple and each event led pretty seamlessly into one another. every PC's goals were focused towards the sessions objectives in a way that let the characters themselves almost entirely move the story, the clay puzzle was amazing as it supported the player's creativity by making each enemy BE personally hand crafted for them, by them. and every location feels unique and flush with classic tropes (polymorph, dungeons, goblins, even starting in a tavern), making it feel as d&d as possible for an intro to the game. well fucking done. also boyl and the peeler are amazing npcs, elegantly simple
yall should do a live streamed dnd campain where you stream each session
Sounds like a cool ass oneshot game
i was shocked with the Luap = Paul revelation
Was that a reference? 1:15
This was an awesome video and a hilarious stream, i am ready fir a part 2
This video gave me so many mixed emotions. Please please please, do more!
That was absolutely incredible. Make a season two now.
I recently played my first game of D&D with people who knew what they were doing.  We were in a village that maybe had a vampire that killed everyone?  But since I was sure I'd die if I had to fight, I charmed this old lady and just made her waslk through doorways in fromt of us.  Made her go say hi to creepy people instead of me having to go do it.  The DM was kind of concerned about me using this innocent old lady as a meat shield.
i love how Alphard fused with Larry to create the ultimate normal deadbeat exploited worker..
Is Jaiden a cleric or a sorcerer? I genuinely couldn’t tell…
If I had a nickel for every time a DnD campaign villain was a Wal-Mart manager, I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
Oh my god I loved this so much, will there be more of a similar sort in the future?😍😍😍
It's worth noting that within the last year, Wizards of the Coast has: Attempted to steal money from every content creator using D&D Been caught using AI art to replace actual artists in sourcebooks Hired THE PINKERTONS to threaten a couple and their neighbors to get back cards the man had legally purchased  Fuck Wizards. Fuck D&D. Fuck Magic. Fuck all of Hasbro, honestly.
Jim and vanamelon vs Jaiden
Oh hey it's Larry.
Them giving the final boss depression before changing into his wife reminded me of in my most recent game I tricked the final boss into reading from a book that was so complicated it hurt him and gave him 1 point of exhaustion.
wow i really enjoyed that
I love dnd and I love how you made a video out of it and I really enjoyed it
not first
I love d&d and im happy jaiden is now a d&d player
We must have more!!
"DO YOU KNOW MARK?????"
It's truly a good day when James & Jaiden make videos on the same day.
I love dnd and i am glad another youtuber was indoctrinated
Lof it
When I saw slime was gonna dm, I knew it was gonna be good
yes
Love it
I love this one shop, it seems it was based upon a one-shot call the wild sheep case if anyone else wanted to play this!
When I was in a DND party , My character almost died because I thought it would be funny to Brake dance on an Ice Toad … needless to say my character was almost swallowed whole …
It takes a special person to pull on your heartstrings and then wap you with acid in the face the next second 😂🤣🤣
i love how jacob just chose to be larry lol
The wonderful narration and intrinsic animation applied to the wild sheep chase classic one shot is so fun, thank you for this! <3 <3
Is Paul supposed to just be Larry from Pokemon? haha
I WANT TO PLAY DND TOO BUT NO FRIENDS
If anyone likes this style of DnD the creator of Rick and Morty has a 3 season DND animated series called Harmonquest
8:12 MASKED DEDEDE THEME
The riddle door screaming, “WRONG!” and turning Paul into a disappointed zebra fucking SLAYED me 😂
I would LOVE more DnD related content!
8:23 My friend:what time is it Me:
As soon as I saw the thumbnail, I thought, "Oh, this outta be good"
I love D&D❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why did the cat have a restraining order
IS THAT THE HORSE FROM THAT ONE ADVENTURE TIME EPISODE???
It takes a special kind of evil to inflict Depression onto an enemy, transform into their deceased SO and comfort them... with a full power point blank corrosive blast to the face.  And I'm all for it.
I've played D&D a few times before, but none of my campaigns have been nearly as chaotic and entertaining as this one. Congrats on your first!
4:10 - "oak trees are turning into birch"  Camman18: MY WORST NIGHTMARE, NOOOO!
This makes me wanna write a series of books based on each game I play ( when I learn )
Here from the stream
ICANT with that acid attack  That was hilarious, and I LOVE the refrences in this animation.  Also I hope everybody has a great day/night.
Please make more! I love this!
That does sound fun
Guys I Got A New Supervillain Name. Paul
This was an awesome vid! Would love to see another session!
best part of the video 15:24
If anyone would like to play this campaign it’s called A Wild Sheep Chase and is available for free from Winghorn Press. Super fun adventure and I’m glad she had a blast. 💜
I never tapped so fast in my life as a nerd thank you so much for this video jaiden
I spy with my little eyes Keyleth, Vex, Pike and Grog? 👀
OMG THIS WAS AWESOME! 😆
Very fun video
I KNOW THIS ONE SHOT
I play an adorable orc. His name is Haeden and he is a druid. Due to the worlds issues in regards to orcs he is on a personal quest to make his parents proud and possibly show the world that orcs aren't that bad. For quite some time he was a quiet completely non speaking background character cause he is worried people are gonna misjudg his way of speach since he grew up in the forest in hiding. We have an elf mage who has started helping him with words and speach and who we are madly in love with although not realising yet and she has started going with him when we seperate the group. My orc is wise but has developed a temper when it comes to his elf.  We once went into a library and she asked for a book on some ancient guy. The librarian was very rude and said it's very unladylike. My boy leaned in and slammed a hand on the table. I rolled a 19 on Intimidation and have a +3 bonus so the librarian shat himself and rolled a nat 20 strength breaking the desk. Lucia (the elf) was smitten a lil and had to calm me down and I spent the rest of the session brooding over hom someone could be so rude to someone so pretty.
I love d&d
the problem with Jaiden's videos is, when you finish them, you want to leave a like on the video, but you already did long earlier :(
Alright guys, now we wait for Jaiden to become a dice goblin.
This was an amazing video! Only have commented like 10 other videos and this is one!!! Keep it up😊
I just joined an ongoing campaign and it was the best decision I ever made. I have loved all of the skeleton, mayonnaise, slapping people into literal hell, dragon gods, and future adventures to come.
this would be awesome as a series :D if you ever make a podcast about this, i'd definitely listen!!
We need more D&D session videos 😆😆
YOOOOOOOOOOO IVE HEARD OF THIS ONESHOT, IVE LITERALLY BEEN PLANNING TO RUN IT FOR SOME PLAYERS.
Paul looks like Larry
ye old mart of wall💀
I just realized that Alpharad’s character looks like Larry 😂
I lost it when the worm said “it’s wormin time”
I saw the thumbnail and how can I not click
Is the final boss just a depressed Wal-Mart employe
Why does alpharad look like Larry
Let's go
Session 2. Session 2. SESSION 2!!!!
Did anyone notice that at 9:53; there is the creepy horse from adventure time season 2 episode 2.
Jaiden unknowingly getting about 20k more people into d&d
Paul just doing a JoJo reference at the start
That was amazing. I can't stop laughing. Please do a session 2. D&D is awesome, and you guys have the perfect chaotic humor for very entertaining D&D stories.
Alpharad looks like Larry from Pokémon
Seeing Keyleth in the bar at the beginning was so great!
Jaiden they/them ark?
As someone who plays D&D I thoroughly enjoyed this video.  I hope you keep playing the game and enjoy it.  Please make a whole series of D&D videos Jaiden, I'd watch them all.
I love how Alpha is straight up just Larry
Legitimately crazy timing for this video as tonight was the first time in several years that I played D And D and I actually enjoyed it this time.
At first I thought they were gonna play the A wild sheep chase adventure since it starts nearly identically and almost lost my shit. It wasn't, but it was great nevertheless.
jacob’s character just being larry from pokémon is so funny to me lmao
that ws a wild ride
Yes I LOVE WHEN PEOPLE ANIMATE THEIR CAMPAIGNS!!
Amazing as always
big fan of how alpharad basically just played larry
This is perhaps the greatest fantasy story ever told.
That disguise self acid blast was the most insane/ fucked up/ hilarious thing I have ever seen. I love it.
Bro u are the definition of worth the wait 😂
Hehehe rancat
I hope there be more D&D adventure stories like this. I can’t believe how this turned out. 😂😂
Time to add this to my dnd playlist I have fir when Dnd club starts next month
Was Alpharad just Larry from Pokemon? Also I correctly guessed that luap was paul jr.
I am so beyond thankful that Jaiden and her amazing team took the time and dedication to animate and narrate this absolutely incredible experience
That’s just awesome. I wish I had friends
I rememebr one of my coolest moments in DnD. I was playing a blind paladin and we had been ambushed by a dragon. We beat it up and eventually it tryed to run away. Just as a joke, I asked if I could throw a pebble at it randomly. The DM made me roll for it, and I rolled a doble nat 20 at disadvantage.  So my blind paladin killed a fleeing dragon while throwing a pebble in a random direction at it.
THat's actually so weird, i just started playing myself!!
that was amazingly chaotic, glad you had fun playing for the first time lol
Why is nobody talking about the Vox Machina cameo in the tavern. It's so good lol.
I liked this
Seeing Ranboo animated as a cat made my day
Love playing D&D and I love watching Jaden and now we mix the two
Can we all appreciate that she gave her dragon born a tail I know that don't have them but they look better with one so sue me
Goofy❤
the mace confusion is hysterical
Casting command and using “Depression” is so wild
I love how Jacob made Larry from pokemon scarlet and violet as his dnd character, that was really funny. Also the fact that Jaiden's character has nothing to do with the bad guys was also really funny. The end was nice! Good video!
Why do I keep hearing this specific prompt for dnd
pls make more of this
Finally, a dnd campaign with short enough episodes for we to watch! OUR BINGE-WATCH WILL BE LEGENDARY!        (what I would not give to join these sessions lmao)
This was so cool!! Please, do bring more of these 🤩
Love the Vox Machina cameo at the beginning. Lol
This is what I was expecting the D&D movie to be like! That was so much fun to watch! I would love more chaos like that! :D
I just saw ranboo on the thumbnail and i immediately clicked
This sounds a lot like a slide deck that some friends and I are doing... Over 300 slides per deck, and a new one each time the comments get maxed out. It's fun though.
Pleeaasseee make moooooorrrreeeeeee
Do spore the 2008 game
ive litterally been waiting for you to play dnd for years cuz i know you would like it
The vox machina reference
*Listens to Paul’s backstory.*  Cool story bro.
I love how jacob was just blonde larry from pokemon
The way you animate your dragonborn makes me so happy
This is a great video
an absolute blast, only just recently got to play again myself. Hope you had fun and it was great to see another animation.
I still think the answer to the third question was 'turtle'
Do another video
My friends and I did a very similar campaign and one of our members get into a fight with the sheep and ended up using them as toilet paper after going to the bathroom. She then proceeded to seduce the guards in the tower by stripping completely 😭😂 D&D can be sooo chaotic sometimes 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You should live streem a d&d game
In classic dnd fashion, everyone has the hardest time solving the riddles even though the dm found them by searching "riddles for children"
This was a DND story I never expected, the twists and trials you guys went through was insane, only to find out that Laup was Paul's long lost son all this time transformed by the evil dark wizard Mark all this time! (I need more of this in my LIFE!)
Love dnd stories Now JAIDEN DOES ONE
SAOJSAIOJASLKJASLKJSALK VOX MACHINA??????????????
Am I the only one who feels bad for mark 💔
I love that this is a world where normal people just go on adventures on their days off.
Without question this is the perfect representation of someone who has never played DND before playing in a group of people who are on their 50th character.
You can tell when a nat one is rolled.
At this point jaiden is a gaming Channel
AWESOME
Nice
Why in the heckity hecking heck is A;pharad Larry from pokemon violet.
paul had it rough my godd
This was amazing
Amazingly done, loved the vox machina reference

15:30 wtf
OMG I play dnd and I am a dragonborn barbarian.  Its fun!!!
The bombs detonate 😂😂😂😂 killed me
Please do more.
DID NO ONE ELSE NOTICE THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME?
Congratulations, Jaiden. You're  a d&d channel now!
Bruv I literally was introduced to dnd a couple days ago 😂
this is the most happiest i've every felt watching a collab
The team heads boping to the music is to good of a way to end the journey
1:16 love the reference to vox machina
you got me with the critical role/ vox machina reference rigth at the beginning
Why is he just Larry lol
I have run this story a few times and I love it.  Edit: similar story. The DM made this their own.
I love the scaly representation
I love that Jacob is just Larry.
I wish I could like this ten billion times, it’s probably my favorite video out of everything you’ve made so far! When’s the next session?
I love that alphas character looks like Larry and has the personality as Larry for Pokémon it is amazing
That Vox Machina reference gave me life!  Also, the fact that Jaiden, who is asexual, chose to play as a Dragonborn is a funny coincidence in my eyes.
Love the vox machina reference in the beginning
I love how alpharads character is just Larry
oh my god this was amazing i love the part where the letters rearranged and they were like "ooohhhh"
Omg d&d is Mt best game
This is cool
charlie mustve rolled terrible for the goblins for them to just dive off the edge LMAO and i love the use of the crown basically just being a literal version of crown of madness
I wish we got to see all of the rolls for each decision!
Hi I’m ten I love your videos
I FREAKIN KNEW THAT LUWOP NAME WAS SUSPICIOUS
Hilarious. You can totally tell the moments when Critical Failures happened lol.
I need more
There are alot of over the garden wall references
I have played this module, perfect one for beginners
I've seen some clever uses of the Command spell in my time playing D&D, but "DEPRESSION" has gotta be one of my favorites.
Not the Vox Machina reference right at the beginning!! ❤
Cool video. Where did you get the battle music from? I may have to use an edgy claymation penguin in a game (probably demon hunters) at some stage.
YES, NEW VIDEO
"TURTLE!" It's Beewee all over again
I guess i would like D&D too, but i don't know anyone to play with.
Catboo it's back 🥳🥳🥳🥳
I think this is the first time I've seen a GM not make a totally serious story only to have it be derailed by the players. You know the kind, where the GM wants to make Record of Lodoss War, but ends up with Slayers (which isn't a bad thing!). Kinda neat to see the GM having fun with the lore, too!
The subscribe plug was funny
I can't wait for all the fan art of Jaiden as a dragonborn
Okay that’s actually genius storytelling that all the players backstories tied together at the end like a Chekhov’s gun situation, I’d love to run a one shot like that
I have my d&d character be a Dragonborn rough! I really like the plot and characters. I suggest that you make your character and put them in your mertch store.
This is so good
Anyone who sees this have a great day
I actually missed this vid at first because I was playing dnd.
This is one of the few things i watched in jaidens subathon, and it was the best thing ever
Ahhh Wild Sheep Chase. It's such a good introductory adventure. It was my first 5e adventure, and in turn I've made it a lot of people's first adventure. There's a lot of starter adventures and they always focus on explaining the rules, but what WSC does so damn well is is delivering on the promise that TTRPGs are silly and personal and you can do whatever you can imagine and it might just save the day.
This had me laughing my ass off, especially that acid-blast to the face bit.
ah my favourite characters, depression, anxiety, and ADHD.
if i can be anything can i be a character that will always succeed at whatever they do no matter the dice roll?
It's amazing how we live in a universe where Jaiden plays with Ranboo, but will never meet Technoblade
But what happened to the turtle😢
WAS THAT A MUTHERF#*&^ VOX MACHINA RECERENCE?!
Nah man Jaidens a furry now lmao but I still fr picked dragonborn aswell
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
Really cool to see Slimecicle and Ranboo! This feels way more like a story/roleplaying than a game but LOVE watching all the art/animation for this story.
I was in a campaign once, and I almost one shot a boss with my rogue character. Another campaign, we went into a dark cave, and we had to roll a perception check. I rolled low, and the DM said "you see a butterfly fluttering about." It was quite some time ago, but I think it was a dragon or something. It became an inside joke for a long time. 😂
More… PLEASEEEE
Ahhhh a critical role reference <3
That's so coool
Is it really a dnd campaign if it's not insanely chaotic?
Oh yeah, I think I saw a clip of that wife transforming bit a while back.
I DIDNT KNOW D&D WAS FUN
Welcome to the DND club jaiden
seeing vox machina in the first minute and a half, I could already tell this video was gonna be good. >:)
Dm:Roll for how good the video is. Jaiden:Nat 20
That was the funniest thing I've ever seen, and so true to DND, I love it
Paul is hilarious
You guys should do dungeons and dragon but with DougDoug foods but his twitch chat makes the story.
I feel like these people aren't chaotic enough to be true bards
pt2.
Is Alpharads carecter just Draco Malfoy as a 50 year Old
Paul’s luck is so like Jacob
Very nice vox machina reference close to the start of the video
Bro I thought that blue shirt guy was Bryson from haminations😂
I love the use of what HAS to live audio when you execute your plan on the BBEG
THE PSYCOLOGICAL TORCHURE YOU PUT THAT MAN THRU!
this was awesome
That was wild from start to finish. Also your team was kind of the bad guys, huh? xD
FREAKING AWESOME!
Lmao
REALLY digging the Wind Waker soundtrack in the background
Marc looks like Pringles man
Ari needs a character too!
How did i knew that jaiden will be a dragonborn?
This was bloody hilarious 😂, I love DND, I’ve just started a new campaign with my friends that is very sea shanty pirate feel. Even though we haven’t come across pirates, we’ll it’s set on an island at the moment lol. Something is killing sheep and other crap, and I’m trying to find a mysterious hermit lol 😂
Id love a dnd channel of yours
Sounds like a hilarious One Shot to play 🤔😁
I would absolutely watch another dnd animated video
YES I LOVE DND
Can i join :)
Man I wish I had friends to do this
OMG I caught that Vox Machina reference. Didn't think you were a fan Jaiden!
15:14 me thinking jaiden was just going to stab him in the back:
This sounded like so much fun!
this was so cool!!! omg the mark thomas twist was amazing and the acid blast was incredible this inforces my want to play dnd jeezz
1:16 THATS VOX MACHINA?  I love critical role and Vox machina is forever in my heart
Charlie aka slimecicle aka Charlie slimecicle aka the most crazy unhinged psychopath you meet, in a good way
My character's a dragonborn too!!!
8:20 you can tell Charlie was the dm lmao
This video is stupid, and i love it. cringey       But i love it ❤
I never played D&D either, only one of my friends plays it. But hey, why am i "dragon" around this information. (Idk)
Play dnd with magic the Noah
4:48 Thank you for selecting: Casual Bongos
Accurate representation of an early dnd experience: Rapidly bonding through horrific, yet hilarious, acts of violence and disregard for safety.
I love the critical role reference in the beginning :D
Jaiden + DND ??? ("0)  THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER
THATWAS INSANE THE PLOT TWISTS MARK AND THOMPSON WERE THE SAME PERSON LUAP WAS PAUL JUNIOR THIS WAS AMAZING PLEASE MAKE MORE VIDEOS OF DND
Love the Crit Role cameo :)
Please more 😂
I would give my life for Zoot
As the time of writing this comment, there are 6,636 other ones. There is a 0.015% chance you’ll see this, you’re one in a million.  Have a nice day.
Ranbongos.     *Ranbagpipes.*
Ah yes power word depression
I remember this livestream, it was UNHINGED in the best way
A literal cat person, a dragonborne, then just a depressed person. I just wanna add, there were too many good jokes.
Alpharad’s character reminds me Of Larry from Pokémon
I am a very experienced DM so not a lot surprises me that other DM's do, but the axe getting peeled was absolutely hilarious. That caught me off guard. 😂 Brilliant DM work.
I'm confused
We need a part 2 pls people that agree (: 👇
welcome to the club
I would watch full episodes of you playing DND!
WE JUST RAN THIS ONE SHOT! it was a 2 player party and me soulknife rogue v.human noble and my companion bugbear monk adventurer found the sheep  played charades with it trying to understand it for half hour until i remember i got telepathy(subclass skill)  started with my snobby noble being arrogant but dropped the act the second time monk landed crazy high dmg🤣  funniest crap was trying to find a sheep dragon our dm searched some sus site by mistake and ended up with a furry sheep dragon which innocently he didnt notice but we did and kept laughing each turn looking at the token being merciless lol.   Man dnd is fun.
As someone who played in a campaign where gold doors were a boss room, this triggered some left over PTSD  Great video as always!
As a dnd player i love that Jaiden has played dnd Thank you for playing this and expanding it to more people!
I love the critical role easter egg  at the beginning, was finally able to start watching their show
YE'OLD MART OF WAL 🤣🤣🤣
Kinda surprised you didn't choose to play as a Kenku (Bird person) race 😂
Finally an animation story, been a kong time qas getting worried this became a stupid MC SMP Chanel and I'd have to unsub.
the cat is giving 11 year old original character
I’ve never played D & D before in my life, but this incredibly hilarious video might convince me to. Honestly, I didn’t know anything could be so tragic, funny, and weird at the same time. Great job Jaiden!!
The second the sheep came I knew what they were playing lmao
this video was SO funny. jaiden i love all your content so much :) also 12:36 i appreciated this so much lmao
1:16 VOX MACHINA SPOTTED
JAIDEN HAS ENTERED THE D&D SUB-REALM OF ANIMATED STORY TIME!!!!
VOX MACHINAA
that was epic!
I gotta see a session 2!!!
And this is why I love d&d
Awesome, no notes, 10/10
I love DnD... and I love animation... AND I LOVE YOUR VIDS  This video is my dream
The legends of vox machina easter egg was amazing
This was amazing!
I remember this from the SUBATHON
I just had a session today where in the aftermath of one of our groups members letting slip that we planned on turning our backs on a group of gods who were manipulating us while pretending to be inducting us into their circle, we managed to checkmate them by stalling for time long enough that we ended up in the waters of the strongest god left in this world who killed them as we died, and while normally that god would have claimed our souls we had also convinced the gods to send off the entire crew of our ship and our little rock golem companion Bato back to our home island where we have a School for all the Druidic children that all came to be because of the same character who let our plans slip, Bato carrying with them a strand of hair from each party member which let us be Reincarnated by some of the Druids back home before our souls were taken.  So yeah D&D is a little crazy but it is so damn fun.
i wanna play D&D so badly...  ...unfortunately, i have no patience, no focus, and no friends.
This was so fun hahah :D
THE WAY SHE DID MARK WAS FOUL 😂😂😂😂 please dear god do more of these 😂
Love the Critical Roll Reference
16:21 is this a reference to that one meme where a girl says: “would you still love me even if I was a worm?”
Foreshadowing 😮😮😮
Wait so is Tsu a Wild Magic Sorceror bc she blew up the inn casting speak with animals?
quick question is there anywhere i can watch the whole thing? like just y’all goofing around during the actual dnd game? bc i feel like seeing the background banter would be funny
Awesome campaign hope to see a session 2!
❤
“Zoot pulls back, just a bit, just to look into Mark’s eyes which are sparkling with tears…”  *emotional music pause*  “And proceeds to acid-blast him POINT BLANK FROM THE MOUTH”   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAAA
in one campaign i was playing i backfliped over two people in a very small hallway and the roof was very low so uhhhhhh we had to roll to see if i would make it and i may or may not have rolled a 1 and my foot got stuck and i was kinda just up there suck above their heads lmao
16:00 bro what💀💀
Day 4: Asking Jaiden to Play ROBLOX
“And casts disguise self to turn into Marks ex wife” The knowledge that this was Jaiden’s first session makes it so much better
I want to play D&D so badly, but I don't know how to and I'd prefer doing it in a real group instead of online since I learn better with more hands on stuff, it'd also be preferable if I played with at least one person who already knew how to play so they could help teach me
For anyone curious what story they used, ITS IS CALLED  Wild Sheep Chase
Anyone else notice the Vox Machina Easter egg?
I was so shocked when I saw this Cuase this came out so fast
I literally just hosted a dnd session and see this come up on my feed
Everyone who has not played dnd 👇
I saw this and at a first glance went "Oh! Jaiden posted! And there's Alpharad! How nice! What else??? HOLY SMOKES IS THAT SLIMESICLE AND HECKING R A N B O O ?!!!".  Very cool vid. Absolutely loved it 🤣
Vox Machina reference pog
this was awesome!!!!!!!!!
7 easter eggs I saw
Peeled axe 😂
I love D&D, it's so much fun!! I'm currently playing a campaign as a Goliath Cleric/Druid named who uses a mace.   Edit: Other than that...He uh...he started a harem of Goblins and Orcs- 👀
Happy to see Jaiden experiencing the magic of DnD! There's nothing like it
I JUST played my first D&D game and WE DID THIS ONE SHOT THAT STARTED WITH THIS SHEEP!!! I thought it was awesome that Jaiden also started playing right after I did, but I had no idea that it would be the same campaign beginnings
MAKE MORE D&D!!! please I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
Gotta love the Vox Machina reference :’)
The exact same day I start listening to Just Roll With It, Jaiden uploads a D&D video. It must be fate, or perhaps, DESTINY!
Omg u posted as the same day as James 😊
15:22 Might just be my favorite dragon moment of all time (OAT). LMAO
My character lost his eye falling down a well!
This was so cool
IS IT JUST ME OR THE CHARACTER WITH HEART GLASSES REMEMBERS A LITTLE THE WEBTOON HEROES OF THANTOPOLIS??????
YouTuber d&d? YouTuber d&d😀
This is evil
This is so enjoyable to watch! Nicely done
NGL, Story was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 XD
I love how Alpharad was pretty much a more depressing and less fun version of Larry.
alpharad dressed like larry is so much fun
Amazing!!
I love Paul / AlphaLarry
You should collab with the click one day!
I love this!
I like bread😊
It hurts to see bagpipes not animated correctly lol 9:15
I remember this live from the Subathon!! :D
Shout-out to vox machina lol
I Remember this on her stream XD
I love the Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga Music <3 Amazing Video as always ^^
I play as a dragonborn paladin and I'm unlucky, but anyways great content
That was the weirdest but most interesting story I have ever heard
I absolutely NEED a part two!
Man I love the superstar saga music in the background, what a classic
DnD is good. Y'all should get into it.
Dude!!.... Love your Story`s!!...   Point Blank Acid Blast..... Jajjajajajajajajajajjaja
we're popularizing dnd and it's awesome <3
I always wanted to try dnd. But I don't have any friends, or friends that play it. As well as my relationship partner discouraging me from trying it
The tale of the three musketeers: Zoot, the dragonborn  Tholamew, the bard Larry.
Slime is an incredible DM, but i still feel sorry for the horrors you put him through XD
8:02 noot noot,pingu
love the vox machina reference ❤
Great video as always
...COMMAND DEPRESSION!?
I remember watching the vod of that session, you definitely displayed how fun it was through your awesome animation!
This entire game is beautifully chaotic and I love it.
Dnd session where half the cast doesn’t  die?? That ain right
God this is so epic I want to do this but I’m afraid of people 🥲👍
That was really fun to watch, I hope to see the other threes reactions eventually
J, you got really lucky to get some good people for your first run of D&D. I and a few others I know haven't been so lucky. If I hadn't gotten lucky with my 2nd group I don't think I would have kept playing. I've grown to the point of DMing my own home brew and am glad I stuck with it. You got some great friends to give you a fun introduction. Welcome to the D&D community, we're glad to have you!
Phenomenal Video! PLEASE do another one of these! maybe invite more of your friends like James, too!
Ella's vest doesn't have a manager tag on it, which means Mark was in a romantic relationship with a subordinate. Clearly a terminable offense.
I liked paul
Jacob's character = Nanami?!
cool
Can i join the next session?
I'm already subscribed because you're the best
Oh my god, first of all, this is freaking hilarious. I completletly forgot about the whole turning into his Ex Wife thing.😂  Secondly, I am in LOVE with the facial expressions this video!
My group does not play dnd but we do play starfinder. Basically pathfinder but you know SPACE.   Our insane moment was when me and my party killed a dragonkin leader and my party member (who hated the leader) cut off his head and took it with us. Me being a dragonkin....was ok with this. Next, we faced a door that had a security wall. Luck for us...I took the guys key card. Unlucky for us ....only one of us could pass. So I had the idea of tossing the card OVER the door to let the next person pass who would proceed to do the same thing! Long story short after some fighting we got to a door that needed a bio signature to enter.  That's when my party member remembered the freaking head he was carrying.  We scaned it and entered no problem to my gms historical laughing. It was gold.
This is crazy timing omg. I just finished watching the dnd movie and it was SOoooo good. I and i almost just played dnd for the first time as well too but decided against it bc we had just watched the movie lmfao
now I want to play D&D
That moment which made players leave the character was beautiful <3
i loved it.
XD just XD  HAHAHAHAH... HAHAHAHA... HHHHHHHHHHHHHHH... HAHAHA!
Mark Thompson is the single most tragic character in media.
I hope you enjoyed and play more dnd this was amazing xD
Is it just me or does paul look like, paul from the guy who didnt like musicals
Is dnd the on with the 20 sides dice? If so you can tell what they rolled judging by the attack effectiveness
awesome
Didn't Jaiden blast someone with acid POINT BLANK
DEPRESSION❕❕❕
Jaiden…. CAN WE GET MORE OF THIS? Like, maybe livestreams of you doing DND? Or more animations about it???
Make more dnd videos I like them
Jaiden, Alpha and Ranboo, look suspiciously similar to Susie, Kris and Ralsei from Deltarune
Bro Paul seems like Larry from pokemon
What was so cool and I really want to see more of this content at later dates
I already love this canal but now I know you play dnd I love it even more 🎉!
jaiden what happend to the adventure time horse WHY MUST IT BE THE SILLY HORSE WHYYYYYYYY
I love D&D, but I've never played it 👍
OMG, I have allways wanted to try D&D but havent had de chance, this was so fun
A wild sheep chase. Absolutely love this one. When I ran it for my party one of them ended up fighting the sheep for 30 min. Needless to say the wizard lost... getting knocked unconscious by the sheep 😂😂😂
I hope this is part one...
I had a similar one shot with my friends and we didn’t know how to use a wand so I tried to turn our goat friend back into a human and he melted into goo and died. It was awful
The door’s eyes look oddly…nostril-ish…
Ok the whole depression command, turning into his wife to approach and blast him at point blank range is the most psychopathic plan of attack I've ever seen in D&D
Ye Olde Mart of Wall 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I can't breathe
12:37  I still love this
1:16  I KNOW THOSE PPL  CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCEEEEEEEEEE
Would you still let me be a manager if I was a WORM  I’ve seen worm repeat 3 times lmao (door, clay thing, manager)
When I saw this I screamed in the air with exitment
That was freaking awesome
JAIDEN I LOVE HOW YOU USED LEGEND OF ZELDA WIND WAKER MUSIC❤❤❤
This is the most normal dnd game ive ever seen
9:51 ... Is... Is that a threat? Should I be worried?! WHAT DID I DO WRONG?!
Love the idea of Jaiden doing more D&D animations! :)
Omg I need to play dnd
I love how you made Paul’s design look like Larry from Pokemon s&v.
Jaiden here's a heart :D <3
this video had me GAGGED it was so so funny and adventurous and FUNNY
Why does alpharad’s character look like  Larry from Pokémon
I REMEBER THIS STREAM! amazing :3
More DnD!!!!!!!!!
Session 2 when? This was so fun to watch!
The detail is crazy. I died at the adventure time horse reference
that was really unique and cool i really enjoy it
ik Zelda music is used in EVERY youtube video nowadays, but it works so well for DnD
In one session with my friends we managed to kill 3 goblins(one by arrow, one by being pushed off a cliff) start a forest fire, and piss off an entire civilization of underground goblin people. I then proceeded to stab the biggest one (18 ft tall) in the balls
I can’t tell if I’m glad or disappointed you cut out the bird that turned into a naked human man lmfao  Absolutely loved this stream rewatched it so many times hope we get a second one-shot sometime!!!
I thought that her and mark would have a nice moment, instead mark is killed by getting acid in his face :)
NO WAY!!! 💀💀💀 Jaiden in a DnD campaign. Omg. 🎉❤❤❤ I love DnD
The randomness of getting a turtle out of nowhere made me chuckle It's so random and yet so expected, as the players try to find how high is the ceiling to what they can do
Wait. Have I not seen this before.
I love the last song in this video but I don't recognize it! Can anyone help? What an amazing story, Jaiden!
that was amazing, more of these would be so fun!
14:50 Holy moly its the scene!
Please do more D&D stories
Alpharad is Larry confirmed?!?!
Omg not the critical role reference
It’s a good day when Jaiden and James upload
4:32 had to go back a pause to see, and yep, those are the names Greg calls his frog in Over the Garden Wall Mad respect, frickin love that show✨✨  9:52 and also the creepy horse from Adventure Time, wonderful references
this is insane you look like you would be a dragon too
Fable reference 5:30
New jaiden post horray! Hoping for a new nuzlock
WE NEED MORE OF JAIDEN AND RANBOO TOGETHER they're such a fun duo
AGAIN AGAIN AGAIN!!! OMG PLEASE DOO A SECOND ONEEEE
4:15 That silhouette in the background isn’t threatening at all!
please play more D&D in the future, this was so entertaining and amazing <333
Everyone: Why is your favorite Pokemon character Larry?  Alpharad: *Yes*
did anyone else see the reference to The Legend of Vox Machina in the beginning?
6,445th comment
Ahhhhhhhhhh
the best think is that jaiden is just like Inumaki from jjk, with his cursed talk and the simble on the tongue
A yes the three primordial Heros, a Furry, a scaley and Larry.
Me and my party burnt down a orphanage,  We were made up of Warforge named bread Some angsty guy who's parents were killed by unicorns Succubus  Strong dwarf  I dont remeber who the rest were I just know that our stand in DM was always distracted  because someone who never played but hung. Around us all the time was always talking about Ranboo all the time and then we never made progress since
omg its Larry
The acid blast took me by surprise💀😭
Beautiful bit of chaos right there
Did Alpahrad just make Larry?
Paranormal Order next!
This was amazing and I loved it.
Welcome to the official world of the supernerd
Mark Thompson lost his wife and child when she divorced him, but never experienced depression? Damn, he really was strong
that first second of the beginning part started to sound like elden ring
Power word, depression. That’s a new one.
The worm dissolving at 9:12 in the style of that one emoji dissolving was what got me lmao
So Tabaxi Bard, Dragonborn Wild Magic Sorcerer and Presumably a Fighter with the Protection fighting style? If this is level 1, then I'd assume the Fighter and Bard don't have their subclasses picked at the time of htis video. The sound waves I assume are Thunderwave mostly, and looks like yall did it right, good job. The crown acted like crown of madness, funny move on the DM's part there. As for the rest, I'm not so sure yet.
Damm ramboo
0:30 bro YES
You uploaded this WHILE I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF PLAYING DND
Loved the video! Keep it up!
alr 0:27
Jaiden’s dnd character looks like Susie from Deltarune
I’m literally starting out aswell ahhhhh!
of course ranboo would be a Tabaxi
The fact this was posted 2 days after I had my own first d&d game is wild
A walmart manager.... sounds like my kind of D&D enemy
As someone with a brother named Paul, I immediately recognized that the sheep's name was Paul spelled backwards, nice one lol
Woah Jacob really went, “I’m gonna be Larry”
Good shit
This was AMAZING please do more
Mark was so depressed he brought out the violin.
Bruh does every youtuber just so happen to know eachother somehow
Omg make  another
I love watching this as a dm. So much. And the amount of nat 1s that must have been rolled is so funny to me
Not the kind of homebrew I'd play, I'm probably old fashioned. But I prefer plain old medieval fantasy worlds without anything related to reality. No modern slang, ideologies, architecture, etc. Though the Cyberpunk campaign I was in was fun while it lasted. Unfortunately it ended after my character assassinated a story NPC he intended to be a boss later 😂. He was a new DM and I guess never figured out how to continue the campaign after that, but I really enjoyed being a lawful evil trickster rogue skeleton. Had fun moments like luckily starting a gang war so the party could get away in the confusion. And giving a woman a heart attack by detaching 1 of his hands and cling to her face like a face hugger to wake her up 😂. I miss playing him
[|87
3:05 Nat 1?
This is definitely awesome I’m sad I missed this stream
Larry-Rad is actually insane, gonna need a plushie.
OH MY GOD! ALPHARAD IS LARRY!
vox machina cameooooooo  the over the garden wall one was even better 🎃 tis the season
Nah. This reminds me of my Group that Im DMing when they Kissed the Dead and had a romance with a Bagman.
I subscribed just because of that joke 0:38
Yoooooooo
I swear dragonborn for is asexuals, every asexual I know plays dragonborns (including me tbh)
4:33 bong water is perfect
Theres two types of people those that love Paul, because they are Paul and those that love paul because he's so depressing he's hilarious.
Was that Outset Island playing at the back of the tavern!?!? YO??
omg this was soooooo good. it’s so cool seeing my fav story time animator do a dnd session
Please do more!! I need more dnd animated content this good❤❤
nice addition of vox machina in the inn. Great dnd campaign and loved the point blank acid breath attack. knew something was gonna happen but didnt expect that
fire vid
So, i judt met paul, and hearing how disappointed he got at getting pepper sprayed, i can already relate to him in an atomic level.
13:10 Oh my God! The plot twist!!!
Dnd is awesome
16:05 That was epic
THIS HAS NO RIGHT TO BE THIS FUNNY
Fantastic variation of the Wild Sheep Chase
THE COLLAB WE NEVER KNEW WE NEEDED!!!!
Yet again Jaden releases a great vidio
The original stream is quite great, better than this imo
I like how you depicted Alpha's character as Larry lmfao
That horse over the fire at 10:04 got poo brain
I love the adventure time Ice King cow costume just being baked in the background
Why is alpharad larry from scarlet and violet
That moment at 15:23 is truly something you would only see in Dungeons and Dragons.
8:16 anybody know the song here?
I literally startled my whole family screaming NOOOOO when I saw the vox machina cameo. I'm a minute in and this is sooooo cooool!
Alpharad as Larry with an axe...
Hello ranboo on the thumbnail
PART TWO WHEN????
Just started my first DnD campaign and watching a fuck ton of Dimension 20
I really loved how you snuck in Grog, Pike, Vex'ahlia, and Keyleth at the start of the bar scene.
Well now I wanna play it!
Cool I know the cool place that hosts dungeons and dragons nights and for the odds one out the magic of the gathering tournament
oh my god i loved this
Hi, just want to say thank you for your video. Everytime i see you uploaded something i have the feeling loke an good anmie episode realesed.
I heard about the acid blast to the face and absolutely cracked up. I saw it coming for sure.
"DEPRESSION!" *Critical hit! Mark got affected by depression!"
"You should try to impress it."  "Ok!"  "Starts playing bongos."
is alpharad just garry
I love that Alpharad just plays Larry
This was so fun - I would love to see more D&D animated!!! Thanks
Jaiden as a special guest on Just Roll with it when? /half serious
It sounds like a really complicated when it’s a game based around imagination
You gave a man depression!
0:55 ITS LARRY
this was actually so good
We definitely need more D&D content
Don't listen to him he's a zebra got me hahahaha. The goblin camp horse looks familiar... The Eyes... Great job hope to see more of these.
If I had a nickel for every time the bad guy in a youtuber's dnd story is a target manager, I would have two nickels, which isn't a lot but it's werid that it happened twice.
I recently got into DnD, and seeing you making a video about it just as I'm beggining really surprised me
let me tell you this, on the chaotic scale of the campaigns MY group does- this is nothing. But it's nice that you enjoy DnD!
Heyyyy,I heard that Superstar Saga music!! Now I want to replay.
I can feel the DM's frustration through the goblins accidentally killing themselves, which was no doubt the result of unlikely-but-technically-possible repeated natural 1s.
please.. tell me. what is her 2nd channel? I can’t find it m(._.)m
When Jaiden D&D live streams?  I’d watch that
Nice to see Doug Doug reference
i played my first campaign a few weeks ago and yeah that shit was FUUUUN i was a half elf bard whos just a snarky asshole and i loved it
SHE DREW VOX MACHINA IN THE BAR 😭🫶 1:14
They really pulled a "would you still love me if i was a worm?" At the end
alrighty I was already excited for this when I started it but seeing the casual vox machina cameos just made my nerd soul jump up and down in glee
zoot is from Skyrim
Love the adventure time horse getting cooked by goblins
My new favorite Jaiden Animations video.
My first DnD experience two people tried killing each other and another person got caught in a trap and died
Paul... luaP... Paul Jr...  I'm sensing a theme here.
I just started getting into dnd so this made my day!!!
I loved this so much
John
Funny thing: as soon as the clay puzzle appeared, I paused the video and thought of the exact same way that I would’ve tried solving this puzzle, with the only difference being that I molded the clay into a burger before eating it.
Who else saw the beast from otgw?
I wanna play with you guy! 😭
Who else found our brave Vox Machina?? 1:15 ;)
i fricking love this video, i fricking love dnd, please more dnd videos 😁!
MAKE A PODCAST OUT OF THIS PLSS
She should do this more
If you make a second Channel just for D&D storytime I will 100% watch every episode
So you guys and the DM were rolling hella NAT 1s, huh?
17:11 according to the dragon silhuette, I have a feeling that this is a forshadowing a part 2 of Jaiden’s DND adventure with her Dragonborn
Jacob really went and made Larry as his character.
I saw this and immediately clicked on it being the dnd nerd and Jaiden animations fan I am
I wanna play dnd again I haven’t played since highschool and I miss how unhinged it was
I loved the vox machina reference at the beginning
I love this video, if you want to, please make more dnd content
I wasn't expecting to see Critical Role characters in this video! Nice job, Jaiden!
Do more and do a really long campaign I love those animated stories
Nah but why does Paul look like Larry from Pokémon SV
This video kinda summarizes the logic in my dreams.
The problem I have with DnD is that I'm a Pixie, so... it's a bit difficult for me to try and ask a group to potentially DnD with. Being only a handful of inches tall is a bit out of some people's league. Plus, I haven't really seen many DMs authorize player characters to use Fae Magic.
HOLY SHITTTT
The main thing I learned from this story is that Slime is a fantastic DM!
D&D is a game i want to play so badly considering i love to create stories, ocs, and fantasy 😫
Both Jaiden AND James released a video today?! My my! I won't get any work done today will I 😅
Damn I would really love to see the actual dm stuff because Charlie as a dm would be funny
En efecto es cine 🧐🧐
a
Such a funny silly group I hope to see them (more) on jrwi or other one shots
15:28 I love how slime appears to laugh
When I saw the Jaiden wife moment live I cackled for 5 minutes, recorded it, and planned to make it an animatic BUT THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER
I would love too see a whole video of you guys playing DnD!
THAT IS SO CRAZY I PLAYED DND TODAY AS WELL WHAT
I would legitimately watch this as a tv show
DEPRESSION
so, not even a minute in we see, a blonde 43 year old businessman, someone stuck in a time loop and explosions... this seems similar to something I've seen before
This ate 😭
Already in the first 3 minutes this campaign sounds like a fever dream influenced by LSD and anything you could find in a medicine cabinet.
This was amazing, 10/10, I demand a sequel ❤
😂😂😂😂 what the heck I just saw. 😅  It just me or there was a loot of 1 rolled.
So is this a one shot campaign or continuous? Also Lar....ahem I mean Paul is awesome.
Is alpharad supposed to look like Larry from Pokemon lol
15:27  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I LOVE D&D SOOOOOOO MUCH
Makes for a ridiculous story that barely makes any sense, but that's the magic of dnd 😂
paul is like super depressed
I tried DnD first group I played with ruined thee entire game for me so I swapped to warhammer and have been happy ever sense
Jaiden should be a voice actor
I dnd cause you can have the most serious and mature campaign or you can just be goofy and become an apple with god abilities. Great vid Jaiden! :D
well, that was fun!
The Paul Jr. reveal legitimately made me gasp
You should have made a number or something to tell us what number you got when y’all rolled for something
Vox Machina at the inn just chilling made my day
i love the vox machina cameo in the tavern!! if you dont watch critical role, id really recommend it ! <3
I didn't get the luaP thing until the visual was given. That's clever
I made love to a dragon. I love dnd.
15:30 that was the most fucked up thing you ever did
This channel's content has come so far since it started out, and my God is this video a perfect example of the astounding quality of the videos on this channel lately.  This one's got it all: the storytelling is on point, Jaiden's vocal performance is compelling and vastly improved from her early works. The animation is delicately stylized and buttery-smooth - the frames pop out like panels from a comic book, especially in the climax. Look at how beautifully drawn and coloured this video is (especially at 16:12 with the atmospheric lighting effects in the background and the visual effects that call to mind some of the flashiest 80s anime series)! And to think Jaiden's first videos were almost completely in black and white!  I can't wait to see JaidenAnimations get even more slick and stylish as the quality of the content uploaded to this channel continues to make further leaps and bounds in quality. Already I am astounded by every new video that she publishes - each new upload is better than the last, whether through the wittier comedy, the more engrossing plots or the crisper, more vivid visuals. If this is the direction this channel is heading in, I have no complaints!  But now on a more personal note: Jaiden, if you're reading this, I just wanted to tell you that your videos are redefining what it means to be a creator of quality content on YouTube. You lead one of the only channels of this size that has ever undergone a successful genre shift (from storytime animation to gaming animation) not only without alienating its audience but also broadening in size and encompassing a whole new portion of the Internet. That is no easy task, I'm sure, yet you pulled it off. You've also adapted to your changing audience, while remaining completely unbothered by the status quo, so I certainly can't say you're unwilling to diversify!  I just wanted to tell you, Jaiden, that even though you don't even know who I am, and even though I've never met you in real life, that the things you do are absolutely mesmerizing. You never disappoint with your consistently high-quality and beautiful content that leaves me either smiling ear-to-ear or shedding tears - you are among the few YouTubers that can do that consistently for me. Just today, watching you retell the story of your D&D campaign made me relive my childhood and teenage memories, from back when I played Dungeons and Dragons for the first time and got hooked right from the start!  You're fucking fantastic, and I implore you not to ever let anyone tell you that you're not. For our sake - your sake, my sake, your viewers' and your supporters' sake - never let them permeate you, even when their words and their actions bite, sting, kick, scratch, cut - because we all love you. Every single one of us loves you more than you could ever know. And I'm sure your enemies wouldn't ever want to be enemies with you once they get to know just how wonderful and beautiful you are, in your mind and in your soul. Keep shining on like the brilliant star we know you are!!!
This was such a good video i wish we can have more and i love the story of the dnd sesh great work
14:48 ... wait, this feels familiar... 15:28 OHHHHHHH
This was funny
Always remember, The DM is God. On an unrelated note, God can be bribed
Ah, a mix of edgy backstories, magical mayhem, and horrible choices... now that's dnd for ya 🫠
i love when the worm says "its wormin time" and starts worming all over the place
I could never play D&D because without my meds I lack any and all creativity.
Amazing. I can't wait to see it turn into a campaign of the scale of Fool's Gold
that was so funn!!
The way Jaiden acid blasted Paul’s boss in the face tho 💀
Paul is my spirit animal
I LOVED THE VIDEO, TY FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERIENCE
instantly spotting the vox machina reference very nice
Yay jaiden video
That was the best story I’ve ever watched.
1:15 ayyyyyyyyyy vox machina reference
I have to admit. I was NOT expecting that twist with Thompson and Mark and then LUAP. Like DANG.
My favourite part was when the clay worm says it’s worming time and wormed all over the place
It's fun. And the fact you use imagination
WOOO!!!! D&D VIDEO IT WAS SO FUN TO WATCH :D!!!!!
Omg i love it !! i used the same premise (transformed sheep and wand) and its so fun to see a different story and ending with it !! its amazing !!
I love the reference to vox machina
If anyone is interested in DND, might i suggest Charlie’s DND podcast Just Roll With It. You wont regret listening to it. Or will you?
Power word: depression. I remember seeing this clip...
Please say this will become a series!
Sounds like y'all had a fun time! <3
Why is there a T on the crown is it for Technoblade ?
you should play dnd again im 12  jaiden hears this  gets flash backs
Hello there, my name is Wilhelm, it's nice to meet you.
guys the song just says nintendo stuff i need to know what the first song is
You mind explaining the psychological warfare you did on Mark? I mean, that was CRUEL!
My nerd ass immediately spotted the Critical Role reference.
The cat persons still in a time loop.
The answer was zebra! Sent me
This was hilarious!!! Literally laughed the whole way through
14:08 DEPRESSION!!!!!
15:27 top 10 Jaiden moments
That sounds soooo hilarious and cool!
As a guy who does DND I can say the start of the plot is kinda accurate and normal tbh
YESSSSSSSS I LOVE DND VIDS
This was amazing to watch lmao AND I SPOT VOX MACHINA CHARACTERS 😮
What is the music played at the end called again?
I WANT A PART TWO THIS IS AMAZING
that music at the end satisfied the living shit outta my heart<3
Dude, this is honestly my new favorite video from jaiden!
Thiss is the best video ever I realy hope she makes a part 2
i'm a dungeon master so you know
I want to see the actual game to see how everyone else reacted
Jaiden point blank acid spraying mark after turning into his ex wife got me
The amount of trauma that D&D characters cause is immaculate  Mark's wife just suddenly appeared, forgave him, then suddenly tried to attack him
I would love to see the next session!!
Is it just me, or does Jaiden’s DnD character look like Susie from Deltarune?
THIS WAS AMAZING
Uhhh Alpharad’s character looks like Larry from Pokemon, is this intentional?
I absolutely ADORED this video
Ranboo keeps claiming he's not a catboy and getting irritated when people call him one.  And then he does stuff like this and decides to play a tabaxi.
Jacob literally just played fantasy Larry. Brilliant.
so long gay bowsering someone is such a power move
This was FIRE, I'd LOVE to see more D&D sessions!
i loved that so much
So you're telling me a Walmart manager isn't depressed?
So D&D is always unhinged. But this was something special. Congrats on your first session being this chaotic
The superstar saga music is an incredible fit to this adventure
9:13 That one finally made me laugh! You make good content
I LOVE THIS!!!! I would be so down for a mini series of the adventures of Zoot, Tholomew and Paul
I'v been wanting to try DND for so long!
Holy cow I remember this
Let's be real though, Jaden would be a great DM
finally the DND one got an animation!
I love the little Taako Easter egg in the bar
Make an animation about the whole story
Oh I liked this, this was good
was shaking and crying at the ending of this truly the most emotional story I have ever seen
It’s so obvious that Paul is just Larry from Pokémon
We NEED dnd content from you
This is hilarious!! I’m currently in my first DnD campaign in school and am also a Dragonborn (an ice one)  We each played for three turns in which, after waking up in a tavern room, I: 1. Rolled and failed trying to find the restroom 2. Rerolled and found the restroom 3. Failed to steal the tavern’s noticeboard by dropping it in front of the entire tavern, everyone went quiet and the tavern owner walked up to me, and put the noticeboard back up on the wall.  After this I went back to the tavern room and cried myself to sleep.
Yeah, I also have a friend who's like Jaiden: So unhinged and uneedlessly aggressive that the DM is so done that stops helping the party LMAO
I like how Mark Thompson casually pulled an Obito
CRITICAL ROLE CAMEO CRITICAL ROLE CAMEO
So people have just completely forgiven Hasbro/WotC for the crap they tried pulling earlier this year?
this was fun
i love dungeons and dragons
ok that's the last straw i gotta play dnd
Did.... did Jacob really make his character freaking Larry from Pokémon
I love it, i just loved it
I recently had my first game of dnd and it was amazing. I played a Dragonborn cleric and I made this whole background. (Wich I think is pretty cool). I hope you’ll keep aging fun ( and maybe make more videos about your dnd campaign 😅)
hc that zoot is just a kobold who thinks theyre a dragonborn
That was such a good episode!!!!!
Jaiden, when this was first streamed, the ex-wife acid-blast went viral.
One time in a D&D session I kidnapped when I really kidnapped I saved a man from six goblins, undetected end. It was amazing like I was rolling numbers that were probably statistically impossible. I haven’t run the numbers, but it was just hilarious because the next number I got after I save the man was a three and I was dying laughing.
Vox Machina just chilling in the starting bar
O
Now I wanna do d&d now
"A man in a suit approaches the dragon and starts a casual conversation"   *Chevy commercial begins*
things i didnt know that i needed in life were DnD stories told by jaidens aniamtions
When I saw Jacob's character in a suit I thought it was gonna be an isekai joke
This game has a move and ot fuckjng STINKS ❤❤😂
JAIDEN MAKES THE BEST ANIMATIONS
I just wanted to learn how to play dnd man…
Paul is serving big pokemon scarvio Larry vibes
Paul Jr. bes
chicken
One of my characters started a cult and overthrew a kingdom. In the cult she made everyone believe she was a moon goddess. In the first session my druid transformed into a bear in front of a goblin chief and he rolled a nat one on something and when he was being hung in a village he claimed her to be some moon goddess, starting my characters journey to becoming a known goddess. My dm said that when she died she became an actual goddess.
I has a similar dream about 14:50 and onward. It’s mainly coincidence but very interesting.
Where have I seen mark before hmmmm
Amazing
Perfect timing. I literally just got into Dnd last week. I had basically no clue what it was until then
The “so long gay bowser” bit had me on the floor 😂😭
I’ve never played D&D, but I like all that roleplay and fantasy stuff, so I think I would like it.
make a second one with 3 other members. that would be awesome
You Said 'charlie' and gave me a small heart attack bc that's my name lol My friends also call me Charlie slimesicle sometimes lol
a man in a suit approached jaiden isn’t that what the sidekick said would happen to her🧍🏾‍♀️
u could be a voice actor ngl
1:15 is that Vox Machina?🤣🤣
Just from jrwi I wouldn’t let slime anywhere near dm territory lol
rurrggghh i wanna play,dnd one day
Alpharad just wanted to get to know Larry better.  Also, JAIDEN IF YOU CAN, TELL US ABOUT YOUR TRIP TO BRAZIL!  (Por favor, quero ver os meus youtubers favoritos no seu estilo de animação)
This one our bard talked a dragon out of attacking us and leaving his hoard behind. We were at level four at the time I think.
Strangely enough this isn't the first DnD campaign I have heard of with the manager of a Walmart as the villain.
That was beautiful ;)
Good video, good times, good group.
0:57 is that a fucking larry from pokemon S/V reference?
New spell depression 😂😂😂😂 love it want to use it
Hell yeah, I also play a black dragonborn! My first session actually ended in me Charm Personing the final boss, lol.
I see you, Vox Machania.
Welcome to the chaos
1:15 I see that Vox Machina cameo!
No
Wouldn't let you play as an Aarakocra huh ? 😅
The way you conveyed the escalation is amazing. 😂 it really does blow up out of nowhere
Jaiden. Please do more of these!!! ❤
7:57 technoblade never dies!
... as a gm, 2 mins in, I can already feel the chaos on this table... respect to Slimecicle for managing the madness so well. Also: the clay monsters... the shier courage to give your players that much freedom in the knowledge that you have to somehow get their creations to fight is just impressive XD
One) So glad that you finally got to enjoy the fun, hilarity and chaos that is D&D  Two) I loved the little call out to Legend of Vox Machina at the Inn, my Critical Role nerd heart squeed. For anyone who hasn't watched it, it's the animated telling of Critical Role's first campaign, two seasons are out on Amazon Prime. Fair warning of adult content and f-bombs galore, but it is amazing story telling. Season 3 is hopefully out next year and they will be animating Critical Role's second campaign as well. Little is known at this point most likely due to SAG-AFTRA strike (all members of Critical Role are SAG members).  Three) Hope you get to play more Jaiden and maybe into a longer campaign.
haha, my d&d campaign, i joined late, witnessed one person in my group perish, witnessed 1st degree murder on a monster, and revived the dead member all in one min.
8:24 love it when the worm said it’s wormin time and worms all over the place
YESSSSSS I LOVE DND AND JAIDEN’S PLAYING IT OMG YAY
I love how this Video came out while i was having a DnD round with friends where we found out that we kinda fucked up the world by killing the B*tch of some God. uwu For a long time DnD was a game that i never saw myself in until my best friends convinced me to join a Session, i first was hesitant and quiet but managed to cool down more and more during the sessions and now i love the unhinged bs that can happen and be done in DnD like ripping the Teeth of defeated enemies, eating lions or hiring blind people to help fight Medusa. :D
OKAY BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE MUSIC CHOICES
Literally my favorite video ever please upload that real vid in parts idc lmao
God its so good
Man I never played D&D, but now I kinda want to! NIce video
That was amazing! What a fun video!
13:10 DOUGDOUG? IS THAT YOU?  Lmao ok but hear me out, Walmart themed final boss, bald, mustache, AND divorced
I unsubscribed bc you said raanboo lol.😅
TBH i kinda wanna see more of these, I think there should be a series too.
9:51 is that an adventure reference????? ( the horse)
I’ve been waiting for you to play DND and learn on it. Yahoo! I kinda wanna share my own stories with this.
Plz do more i loved this❤
I have a sneaking suspicion that Jaiden was chaotic aligned.
We need a series of this
ENCORE ENCORE ENCORE.
This my 5 favorite thing 4 of my favorite content creators and dnd
its joever jaiden is a furry
Classic one shot, ran this module w/ some first timers and they ate it up. Love the content, keep it up.
I once made a caracter that was a mahician that just appeared in the middle of the forest One of his attacks was transforming pepole into chairs
I write novel length fanfics of all my campaigns and it's such fun
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Love to see more of this
this is the most WFT history that I ever heard. great video and of course incredible animation
Kate Beaton and Critical Role references?! Love it!
What the hell did I just watch
0:38 dont worry i subscribed
just got done with dnd and i see this
Love the cameos of the Vox Machina crew! Very appropriate!
i kept hearing charlie’s voice in some of the character’s lines (specifically “it’s wormin’ time”)
I didn't know how much I needed dragon jaiden in my life until now
So when's part two where they go through the dungeon of trials and fight the dragon from Shrek
quit worming around
This video was so much fun to watch! I hope you're able to do more of them in time :D
love seeing more people playing dnd!
Super cool!!! maybe Ialso try D&D!!!!
CHARLIE SLIMECICLE LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo
I need the song at 16:30 lol. I've heard this before somewhere but I have no idea where.
I love the Vox Machina cameos
did anyone else notice vox machina?
The last time I played DND My friend and I burned down a orphanage and we killed the whole town
I think I recognize this oneshot, "The Wild Sheep Chase" At one point the villain used the wand to turn a bed into a bed dragon (with splinter breath weapon), and when the sheep-turned-human revealed that he actually didn't have any money (let alone the payment he promised us), well we hadn't yet handed over the wand so we turned him into a pile of gold coins instead.
This is amazing
I flipping love this, keep up the good work, we love you
yyyyyyyyyyEEEEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YES! More D&D content please 🙏
I feel like you should make more videos like this!
Is that the Mario Kart Wii-Coconut Mall Theme I heard from the intro?? Also did you upgrade your art recently??
seeing vox machina was a welcome surprise
Love the Critical Role references right off the bat 😂
dnd is poggers
Huuuge like on this one. Very well done
mark :(
I feel like sometimes DND was made for some people. This is not one of those cases
Im literaly playing d&d rn
Lol vox machina just sitting there grabbing a pint
Love to see the Critical Role characters lol
I just got a good d&d story today: ok so we are in a medieval campaign and I was absent for the last session and our excuse for me being gone was and I quote "I got in an argument on wizard twitter" and the next session we started in combat and first action I take is using eldritch blast... nat 20 so yep my warlock just looks up from his phone and then smites the closest spider out of existence that mental image is forever hilarious
This was fantastic! Please make more of these! 😂
this was really good i enjoyed thus
This is great
What classes were they?
And here I thought Jaiden would go for a home-brew Aaracockra or Kenku...because birb.
I loved the Critical Role reference in the beginning.
JAIDEN WHERE THE HELL WERE UUUUUUUUUUUUU😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
i need more dnd stories
I am very appreciative that i can share a name with marks ex wife 😌
D E P R E S S I O N ! 😈-Zoot.
The way you started with how he used his charisma 😂😂😂💀💀
And I thought JRWI was bad(funny and silly and deranged). But this. THIS.
jaiden kinda looks like susie from deltarune
Another example of crazy s*** you can do in dnd: My newest character is a 2ft tall Tabaxi who thinks he's a cat since he was raised as a cat by a human family. He has 3 retainers from the noble background. Who are these retainers? Cats. His 'dad' Cheshire, his 'sister' Peppermint (both adoptive... obviously), and best friend Fern.
As for myself, I really enjoy playing that-guy-who-shouldn't-be-part-of-the-team-but-who-is-here-anyway™. A regular miner (pissed at the demon who ruined his workplace by awakening), a harpooner (who realized slaying massive majestic sea creatures isn't as lucrative as slaying massive majestic land creatures), an actual caveman (who has nothing else to do), a devil worshipper (who haven't realize his "god" isn't the nice guy he thinks he is)...  DMs tend to not sigh a lot when I'm presenting my character sheets.
Larry 2?
I love Dungeons & Dragons. I have a character and a dice set, but no handbooks. I e never played, but I am starting to get into it.
Yeah, I caught Vox Machina at 1:16. I’m liking where this is going
Inflicting depression by casting command is just as funny (and dark) as Harley Quinn accidently shooting a guy with a cancer ray.
I feel so bad for anyone that has never played D&D, I'm currently doing a campaign and it's a blast
This was so good
yay you finally posted a video
15:26 I knew she would do something like that and it's as funny as I imagined
I love the nod to Vox Machina!
furry jaiden
I ran this module as a one shot too!!! its great!
This video makes Dungeons and Dragons sound SO fun, this campaign and cast sounds wildly entertaining. I'm a new player with a equally inexperiended DM, so you can only do so much, but it's still fun
The Legend of Vox Machina
I doubled over from laughing when she said she pulls back, and acid sprays him in the face. That truly is the best thing ever. Also I love playing D&D with my friends, it’s so fun!
This video made me so happy, watching the actual session was amazing but seeing it animated absolutely blew me away. I loved watching y'all play dnd together, it was so much fun!!
I'm not the biggest fan of playing pnp's myself, but i live for watching others play I could basicly see the dice roll of a straightup 1 both times the goblin tried to attack and leaped himself off the bridge twice xD
loved it 😄!
The animal roasting at the fire in the campsite was the horse from adventure time
Bro why does this go so hard. Honestly the ambition is crazy
Love the vox machine reference
Such a blast to watch as always Jaiden! but as an avid fan of DnD I wanna hear to tell the sequel to this wondrous epic tale! Love the twist you and everyone bring to everything y'all do!
I loved the inclusion of Ranboo and Charlie's actual laughter 10/10
My dad is so addicted to this game oml
Paul is just a blond larry
cool
Commenting for the algorithm
dragonborn jaiden is a mood
I need to see this live I bet the laughs were from the IRL sesion and that already tells me more than enough that this was a superb unhinged amazing story I need to see
This video is absolutely insane. The story of the campaign is absolutely dripping with Charlie’s charm, ranboo being in a jaidenanimations video is something I’d never thought I’d see but I’m so happy about it. And this chaos is very on brand for everyone involved.
Petition D&D 2 Here  👇
It might be also interesting to try other ttrpgs. Call of Cthulhu, Shadowrun, Lancer, Hard Wired Island...
THIS WAS AMAZING !!!! I WANT PART 2 PLEASE !!!!!
Rolled an 11  ...that means I can say this video is pretty alright!
OMG THE CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE AT 1:16
HAHAHA, love it. Not even a minute in and already love it
AMAZING VIDEO AND I WANT MORE DND CONTENT THAT WAS SO FUN TO WATCH!!
I have played this mission before
I love the vox machina reference🤣
Mark's got himself some issues
I went to a d and d club tho I wasn’t that good 😭😭
What is zoots class
i always wanted to play dnd but i legit could never get anyone to play it with
I would in fact sacrifice my left arm to run a game or be in a game with this group. This looks. So much fun
Is it just me or does Paul look like Draco malfoy
you NEED to make a part 2
Can't believe you mentioned the horse from Adventure Time in your animation, also really enjoying the fact that you and slime have become friends. Something about his chaos being everywhere makes things right.
The T on the crown for technoblade is so sweet
Do this again
RPG is so cool in this way men
Posting a random comment....  FOR THE ALGORITHM!!!! 🎲
Why does it feel like all my favorite youtubers just posted a video at the same time?
2 furrys and a tired human confirmed xD
Thank you for all the Kirby's air ride game, such great music!
More more more more more pleasaase! This was amazing!!! START A PODCAST IF YOU MUST
I already subscribed like 1 year ago or something-,-! Btw I LOVE CALEBS MAN- I MOSTLY LIKE RANBOO 😭
Haven't played myself but can't wait to one day
only 1minute and 28 seconds into the video, i love it, my first character was also a brad that was a cat
Was this campaign wild sheep chase
What is the background music from 12:27 to 14:09?
I feel like this could become like TAZ. Being super goofy and funny but can break our hearts too
The turtle's names being a reference to over the garden wall brought me some wholesome memories ❤
I was waiting for this code since the clip about the acid blast kiss 😂
You were super great on Cosmo's Kitchen too! Hope to see you play with that group again sometime as well :D
ah yes finally a campaign to fill the void that is sword af ending
I also recently started playing D&D, and this video brought me something most things haven’t (happiness)
I CAST THUNDER SPELL!!!
This was radical!
So, your new group, the Slime Den, is going live when? =)
Man, I love when youtubers play D&D for the first time.
can we get more d&d ,please?
9:51 isn't that the wierd staring horse from Adventure Time ?
Nice video
I’m in a D&D club
Seems you had a fun first game!  D&D is such a great game, I'm glad you enjoyed.  You descriptions made it so I could almost guess the dice rolls, and that's pretty cool.
That was certainly a one shot chaotic group XD amazing so much fun
Loved the king dedede music, definitely matches the vibes
The Peeler: "Alright Paul ready for your routine stabbing?"
Thanks Jaiden u just remind me of my dnd sessions with my friends :,D   Oh how to forget when we all vomit and the same smell of vomit makes us sick because we were trying to fight a bunch of rats
I remember my first time playing Dungeons & Dragons. I was the only survivor lol
Wonderful job
Boulder gates 3
dnd? i havnt even watched the video yet, there is a prevideo ad
Oh one time I was playing and we learned that the monsters inside a house were homophobic so of course I took the logical next step of bursting in unannounced and unplanned with my teammates yelling one word “GAYYYYYYYY!!!!!”  Luckily there were no casualties and we killed them… so I have zero regrets!!!! 10/10 would do again
Paul screams Larry from pokemon scarlet and violet
Love The Legend of Vox Machina reference in the beginning 1:15
I NEED MORE!!!!!!!!
Continue.
Jaiden’s dragonborn character is adorable!
Jaiden and James uploading on the same day is a coincidence that I welcome
As someone who absolutely loves D&D and has rules practically etched into my mind, I loved watching this stream and now I get to see it animated! And I love the Vox Machina reference!!
Ok that actually does seem really fun 😭😭 being a dungeon master seems very hard and I would struggle.
I love how Paul looks just Larry from scarlet and Violet but blonde
Paul=Larry
Me who played before and was at the time 12 and got a wish spell: I want a dragon :D (In A world where dragons were extinct)
I’d love to see more of these guys at some point, there so cool and funny! :D
As soon as the sheep with the scroll appeared I was like "f yes!! Wild sheep chase!"
:0 I SAW THAT EASTEREGG AT THE BEGINNING!!! VOX CREW!!!!
13:04 totally missed an opportunity to say "oh, Hi mark"
2 hours gang 👇🏻
I remember watching this on stream. Probably my favorite subathon stream that she did. It's so fun to see this story animated.
Wait if the cat lives the same day over and over agin how did new people show up? And how did marks family not like him if it’s just the same day??? They would not know about it after the first day.
wheres the turtle
I'm just imagining slimecicle talking as all the npcs and it sounds hilarious with it
So an unhappy employee and a neighbour who ruined the life of the villain along with a dragonborn break into a mans house who has gone out of his way to house those who don't have one proceed to attempt to kill and rob a man of their humanity. Perfect DND chaos all with the war crimes included. I don't really know where Luap fits in though. The idea that Mark would go out of his way to do this is fairly out of left field as its clear that he has no strong feelings towards Paul. It adds to the chaos sure, but something here is off
THE ENDING HAD ME ROLLING
charlie slimecicle AND ranboolive????? i’m sorry i think my autism is going to have a very hard time making it through this video
I don't know much about D&D, but there was not one dragon in that adventure. 😂
This is duking amazing
MY TWO FAVORITE THINGS COLLIDING!
THE PEELER!!! SOMEONE GET THIS SMALL FRY ON THE POTATOS!!! 🥔
Omg I remember the Ex-Wife bit during the battle and laughed so hard from it 😂
It’s like the nuzlock vids..but D&D..more please :)
I hope this is the beginning of a long successful campaign
This came out as I am playing DND lol.
make a part 2 Please
MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE
I can’t with Ranboos character 😭
:D
Jaiden plugging her channel and then immediately going "That felt weird" is so on-brand lol
My dm used this Same hook, it was mas chaos. I'd love to see more of this type of content.
Nice animation like always
9:51 looks like there cooking the horse from Adventure Time the Ice King used to spy on Fin and Jake
YO  I laughed so hard at that acid to the face!  I had to rewind the video cause I laughed for the rest of it.
THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE OMG
Zud shouts depression, it's super effective.
larry doesn't get paid enough
1 minute in and already seeing the vox machina characters as a little easter egg , this video will be a banger
It's wormin' time
this was beautiful. i love jacob larry btw that was a great artistic choice
i play and in the campaign i am in I am a MENACE to a magical society (I am a student at a magic school)
Glad you got to experience the chaos that is dnd
With all i know about D&D, this sounds about right
Love the Mario & Luigi Superstarsaga music ❤
Loved seeing newbies instantly channel the DnD chaos the minute the game starts. Loved seeing the Vox Machina chameo at 1:15 !!! Hope to see more of this kind of chaos!!
People, PLEASE, I NEED tose fanarts of dragon-born jaiden!
I would love to see the character sheets for these characters. As I can guess what what alpharada charecter is and Ramboos charecter is.
Ranboo my beloved~ It must have been fun playing with all of these people lol
Ok but like, the range for the voices at 2:07. Jaiden could be a voice actor; I thought a second person voiced the cat
THE QUEEN HAS POSTED 🤩
14:07 if i ever play dnd with my friends i will do that
I actually live for jaidens friend group
this was terrible but Im glad they all had fun
12:30  do they realize Tabaxi's have natural climbing skills? This was so fun, I might have to show this to my dnd group- they'd love it.
I would watch hundreds of episodes of this
This is a great dnd story and command is a great spell if you use it right. I'll have to remember depression for my game. I commanded an ogre to "forget" hoping it would forget where our camp was but it failed its roll with a nat 1 so its memory was wiped clean. Oops
I’m being the funny D&D moments guy I’ll go first. I’m the DM and my group is meet the Big Bad (BB) for the first time the city there is on fire so the dragonborne just walks into the burning building and takes a nap the rest of the party trying to take down the BB sends the 2nd of 3 sorcerers out which is only capable of water and electric spells and in shock the Wizard casts a move that we know as ‘GUN’ which is when someone yells gun and gets a 20,7,5, or 1 and the one bonus of it is if it’s below ten it’s reversed and he gets TWO NAT20s so I just surrender and give him to hand crossbows
YES. WE GOT JADEN
I LOVE THE VIDEO SO MUCH!!! D&D is just one of my favorite things and so is Jaiden and I just LOVE THIS, Keep up the amazing work <3   also love the reference of vox machina at the start :)
This is very similar to a one shot I played in a year ago. It was also about turning a sheep back into his original form, but he was an elf wizard named Finethir Shinebright who was turned into a sheep by his student Noke.
I thought you were going to stab Mark in the back while hugging.  So much more funny with acid blast. Lol
The wild wildshape shifting sheep chase plot hook, always funny
JAIDEN HAS POSTED A NEW VIDEO I REPEAT JAIDEN HAS POSTED A NEW VIDEO😂🎉
MOSKAU MOSKAU
Plz replay to this comment
Is anyone gonna mention Alpharad is pretty much Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet
I need more of these videos 😫
THE VOX MACHINA REFRENCE
Is it just me or do your protagonists kinda feel like the bad guys?
OMG the vox machina group was amazing and just perfect
Ah yes  Jaiden the scalie Ramboo the furry And Alpharad the person
Boy it’s my time of the month all offa sudden.
1:58 truelly a Larry from Pokémon moment
What an amazing adventure ! Just the right amount of chaos. Can't wait to see more.
lmao
Does anyone know the song that’s used at the end of the video? It ties true video together so we’ll I just don’t know the name of it 😭
Why does Paul look like Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet?!
I can see that even in D&D Alpharad gets high rolls
why is alpharad look like the normal type gym leader from paldea? Anyway Love the video its well made and ofc funny <3
If you made an entire channel that was just dnd I would subscribe so fast. Jaiden Animations DND
Wait did the cat get out of his loop
more dnd
Now we just need Jaide, Dingo Doodles and Puffin Forest to Collab. XD
In my first d&d one shot I got married to a god in the first session because my dm was using me as a lan rat for a different d&d group and well they where fighting a god and I was like I seduce him the sm quickly made the God immune to being seduced 😂.
9:52 is that the horse from that one episode of adventure time.
I'm just surprised ranboo is here lol
Great! Now I need more D&D Videos on this channel. 😂🤣
So are we not gonna talk about 1:10 Vox machina just chilling there
Not blasting Mark at point blank 🤣
9:51 yoooo it's the adventure time horse
AHHH the Vox Machina characters hehe
I absolutely love this! ❤️ The CR reference made me grin so much!
Man mark didnt deserve this
Did you notice that Ramboo's character made a crown with a T?
I’ve always wanted to get into DND but never wanted to get bullied for playing the game 😭😭 but it seems fun as hell
I laughed so hard at the Vox Machine refrence. 😂
This is probably the best Jaiden video I've ever watched I couldn't stop laughing at the utter chaos everything I hope they'll be more of this
As a DM I'm stealing this campaign I rolled a 20 beforehand to see if I could and I got a 20 so thanks for the campaign
In the first D&D campaign I ever played, my first instinct when seeing a zombie was to flirt with it. It decided it’d be better to disappear completely than deal with my pick up lines
FFS Can you please stop referring to singular humans/furrys/dragons with plural pronouns. Its so fucking annoying
I never thought that Jaiden would play or do a story about D&D with Alpharad, Slimecicle and Ranboo. But here we are
more
Ok I loooooove this!
I like the look of d&d but i dont think i could play it cause i dont have the brain power
Yayyyyy your back how was Japan
thank you jaiden for making a critical role reference just as my cr fixation begins
There was a time when I wanted to learn how to play D&D but than I opened a book about how to play and I remembered I had ✨ADHD✨
OMG Vox Machina spotted!!
What a romantic acid blast
This was brilliant, I hope to hear more of your D&D exploits in the future!
I needed that laugh omg
god this is making me want to play dnd again. this was awesome
That was brutal to shoot acid at point blank range in the terrible disquase. I think he had depressen stage 9 to not se the reptile features. Ex Maneger mark has taken 2 MASSIVE L's 😂
Love the "The Legend of Vox Machina" reference at 1:14
I hope this D&D group continues so that we can all have a sort of story to watch. Would love to see more chaotic sessions like this.
Me watching this: i gmed enough games to know she is going to stab the bbg even before using play.
this was such a fun video! would love more dnd animation vids
dnd is good but do not support the creators of dnd. I'd recommend doing some research into the OGL stuff from the start of the year, then trying a smaller indie ttrpg like dolmenwood or index card rpg
Awesome campaign hope to see a session 2!
Words cannot describe how much I loved this video
My brother went through reality itself and trickshotted an incredibly powerful being that was about to kill someone who was also a couatl, rolling a Nat 20 in the process along with arrows of slaying and a bow that deals 40 radiant damage if it hits, and my character combined his poison breath(which was flammable) with fireball and wall of fire, rule of cool always wins  Oh yeah we were level 7(edit)
Tbh Ranboo as a cat is the most adorable thing I have seen all day ❤
I love DND
I just came out of my DnD campaign and now i am watching this so nice
Hi how are ya doing
I have a headcanon that *every* dragonborn in the DnD world is born from a Bard managing a nat 20 to seduce the dragon.
I really enjoyed this video, I would love to see some of this and or more DND sessions that you do do if you do post it on your second channel. I really enjoyed all of this and it made me laugh so much.
I wanted to try D&D but my brain won't let me
This was on my bucket list of things I wanted to see before I died. Thank you immensely.
please do more!!!! this was unhibged and amazing!!!! 🤩
Oh Jaiden, I love this game now too. The best part was where you hugged Mark and just blasted acid into his face. Great one. XD Your dragon form is super cool and sweet too-
1:39 like hell you are, your Larry but he decided to dye his hair blonde
This video was incredible!
me: 5:23 "i mean... now your all furries... lol"
I absoutely love the fact that so many people are getting into D&D
give me more
Man if Jaiden has the audio for the entire D&D story I am here for it
Love paul’s exposition dump
You can be anything in DND!  Jacob: i wanna be Larry
This just feels like the first episode of a show you could find on Nickelodeon.
What's your favorite character that you made and played as?
Great that you had fun, but compared to a real DnD session, that's quite boring.
Best use of a command spell that I've ever seen. Absolutely had me wheezing.
i suspect this is not the end
A Odds1Out and Jaiden Animations video in 1 day this is legitness
Guess the dice rolls
"I cast depression"
It took me like 4 minutes to realise the Alpharad is Larry 😂
Jaiden you and James posted videos on the same day
I really like playing d&d.
I had my first session a few weeks back, I now love dnd
That was so fun to watch.
Hey guys, What is the song/music called at 8:14. Thanks in advance.
I MADE IT YASSS
i gasped when i saw this in my notifs ranboo and sliem in the thumbnail gngngnhn
Loved this! Big fan of DND, sounds like an unhinged session
LMAO I REMEBER WATCHING THE MANGERS WIFE CENARIO WHEN YOU STREAMED THIS
I remember watching this D&D Section before I'm so glad she made a animation of it
can't tell if the animal riddles were supposed to be actually difficult but i got them all correct
Ah yes, D&D I have aphantasia, so the game would be really boring for me
Crying because it is D&D But being happy because OF COURSE JAYDEN IS A DRAGON BORN
I love dnd
0:56 *D E L T A R U N E*
I expected Zues to marry Mark after disguising as his ex wife and then they live happily ever after 😭
The way Bardtholomew is animated is always so funny in this, it's so great
Don’t think we didn’t notice the adventure time horse in the back jaiden 9:51
iirc this happened during the subathon right? or am i having a deja-vu  that doesn't exist?
13:10 music name?
I REMEMBER THIS STREAM XD
Having Alpharad as Larry is so accurate for some reason
Slimecicle and Jayden!? YES, two of my favorite YouTubers in one vid
jaiden holds the chaotic role of the adventuring party i see
Seeing Ranboo and Jaiden in the same space gives me sooooo much serotonin
That Laup reveal was crazy
D&D is awesome, glad you tried it Jaiden
I’ve always wanted to try DnD.
super cool campaign honestly lmao
as player of dnd(dm) i can say that this normal adventure
Wow I feel like I just watched an anime
My friends and i had a last of us campaign once it was super fun
15:28 my fav part of the video
This is amazing 😂
Did anyone else think Paul was Draco malfoy
I could understand less than half of what the door said. Audio mixing was pretty difficult to pick apart there.
Omg I'm so excited for this new vid
This was actually my first time watching an entire stream and was the thing that got me into critical role! I’m so happy it got animated bro
How are there more likes than views? Jaiden finally broke YouTube and I’m here for it 😂
i knew this video was gonna have my favorite goopy guy
The cat smacking the bongos is pure gold
Upload the unedited version? Pretty please and I'd really like to listen to it
Ranboo = anxiety filled cat that can play the bongos  Jaiden = chill dragon  Paul = ... depressed with coffee  Charlie = *laughs at the chaos*
LETS GOOOOOOO D&D
So, this below is an actual thing.  I play dnd with school freinds, so we took a vote on a campaign. The winner was a Star Wars a crossover. So I spent time writing the story, balancing weapons, etc. In one part of the story they find a Sith Imperial camp. They kill the Sith there but the lightsaber was ignited and when they killed the Sith I had the lightsaber fall perfectly f___ing verical (Yes that entire battle was for a Rick and Morty reference) and it was missing till I trolled the party by having the lightsaber kill the “Final boss.” Who wasn’t actually the final boss, then I pulled a l Palpatine but instead of a politician it was a Museum Owner. Also I added a NPC Jedi that helped them.
A dnd video by Jaiden would have more likes than views. How is that even possible?
Reminds me of when I was in D&D club at my school. Ah, great times…is what I would say if I didn’t quit it! We spent 2 quarters making characters!
What what is everyone’s class
Vox machina caracters right at the begining, let's gooo 🔥🔥🔥
I think “the peeler emerges from the shadows” is my new favorite sentence
you can immediately see who is playing who
Hmm why does the blonde guy look familiar to two different guys
I was expecting Jaiden to kiss Mark…then point blank blast him
@Slimecicle I would love to see a continuation of their story!!! I remember watching the one shot campaign video y’all did, and I thought it was hilarious!!! Especially when they started to force feed the sheep and turtle the clay. I actually have a suggestion for a new campaign if you want to hear it.😊
Peak comedy
I'm currently getting into DND so i love this :3
Omg I was in a D&D club with my friends and I was a baby Kenku
Oh my gosh, this was one of the funniest videos I've seen in a long, long time. The animation and retelling was top-notch! I hope we can get more stories like this in the future!
The first time I played, it was the most I'd ever laughed
What's the song that plays at 16:30? 👀 Such a banger video all around lmao
we NEED a part 2!
Self promoting lol that's a rule lol
The characters are so cute! Amazing work!
The vox machina reference at the start✨
Having Charlie Slimecicle himself (one of the funniest and coolest humans I know exists) DM my first D&D game would be a literal dream!  I can't wait to DMv for my friends but I don't know if it'll hold a candle to this! Thanks for the great video as always Jaiden.
Now I want all the four of you to play boulders gate 3 together
12:22 remind me of Chip flake? Lmao. I love this animation so much, it's so good. I wish I could make animations like that. I love the cute floofy cat aww
D E P R E S S I O N
This is every DM's and player's dream, to have the highlights of their RPG session/campaign made into qn epic animation! EPIC 🤟🖤👌
I was very happy to see one of my favorite youtubers make a video about my biggest hyperfixation
OVER THE GARDEN WALL REFERENCE
CAN YOU STREAM THE LIVE D&D SESSION NEXT PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE???
Jaiden what is it with you and turning into depressed dude's wife's hugging them then killing them?!
As I'm watching; I'm like..   "Yeah this the exact level of Chaos in DnD that I would expect from Jaiden and Jacob.
This could be useful for the campaign I'm making
I wanna see Jaiden's Dragonborn OC in Baldur's Gate 3.
Jaden you should play yo-kai watch on the 3DS
The tiny violin for depression is hilarious 😂
MY FAVORITE JAIDEN VIDEOO
Oh.. thats great😂
What wow 😮
We need more 👀
Is there somewhere a full video of this campaign?
What happened to the turtle though.
i need more XD
1:15 VOX MACHINAAAA <3
Loved this video
I love the vox machina call out around the beginning.
I'm a simple woman. I see Jaiden. I see DnD. I see Ranboo. I see Slimecicle. I click. Also impressions are spot-on. 9:54 Oh my goodness the Adventure Time horse noooo This whole thing is amazing. What I wouldn't do to hear an audio recording of this shizz. Charlie's DMing remains superior.
Ah yes the best attack of all time, DEPRESSION
Didn’t you have a collab with tomska five years ago
9:50 adventure time reference?
I approve of the Superstar Saga music use here lol
BABE WAKE UP JADIEN POSTED A NEW YOUTUBE VIDEO
Do a second one
And that's how the day was saved again by Susie, Larry and Mononeko (Monokuma as a Cat).
Lol the vox machina at the beging was such a good cameo
I...have never thought to use command to give someone depression lol
What are the odds that I join a DND campaign, and the day after Jaiden uploads this
appreciated the brief cameo of Vox Machina in your already enjoyable art style. Didn't know I needed that big smile, so thanks for that!
This video is one of the most fun she's uploaded. I love when Jaiden collabs with people and especially love when she turns it into an animation. The whole party is so funny and the storytelling is great too! Lots of worm foreshadowing. Wormshadowing. Amazing video!  (Loved Ranboo's character the most, silly lil fella)
I also went “ohhhh” when Luap was revealed as Paul Jr.
this was great! would love to see more, jaiden! :D
dude the point blank acid had me laughing so hard lol
Cat Ranboo is so cute!
IM LOVING THE DND RENAISSANCE
Yay, it's vox machina! I wonder when season 3 will be out?
I would be down for more dnd content here tbh
Jacob had to be the drama lol
vox machine reference  1:15
At the time of watching this, 50k views 75k likes. Wtf
ICE KING HORSE
I remember watching this during you streamathon paol is best boi
Omg hii
This actually taught me about and D&D then I actually know
2 hours
Somehow got 50k view ms and 75k likes
NEW CONTENT?
When you realise the sheep Paul threw like a ragdoll was his sohn🤣
This looks fun now time to spend my fortune on DnD
“They ate the clay” Yeah that’s typical DnD
Was playing D&D one time and somehow we managed kill a demon, but he like... respawned somehow and we just said screw it and set our bard upon it and then they had tieflieng babies who wound up becoming my bf who joined us bc I called him baby boy and everyone wouldn't shut up about it
Can you do a pokemon white nezlok
Paul is kinda..
Now thats just cruel 15:27 😂😂
LETS GOOO D&D
AMAZING
Dnd is so fun. I have session today where i have to rescue on of our friends. He harassed a shop keeper, try to steal his monkey paw, and got kidnapped
I love dnd i was playing a warforged and nuked myself. wild magic is great especialy if the wild magic is homebrewd
This sounds like a very fun campaign
MOAR!
Loved this and the Vox Machina cameo in the beginning! <3
LETS GOOO WHAT A DAY JAIDEN AND JAMES VIDEOS IN ONE DAYY!!!!
the voices were really well done
Did no one notice "BONG WATER" pop up when naming the turtle? 🤭
I like the part where he says "its worming time" and wormed all over the place.
😂😂😂😂
I’ve been itching to play a campaign again, the last time I played was back in my senior year of High school
Why is mark crying sad lol
DUDE! SUPERSTAR SAGA MUSIC?!?!?
The Vox Machina cameo in the beginning 😂
YESSSS
They are also called dms
THIS WAS AMAZING!!!!
I was playing a DnD campaign similar to this but, I rizzed up everything, including the sheep.
Hey this is awsome
KKKKKKKKKKKK I loved it, jaiden and slime would be so great in Ordem Paranormal, kisses from Brasil (I watch your videos almost since the beginning of your channel and I love your animations)
We need more
Jaiden casting Command to give an enemy depressing, casting disguise self to become his ex wife to cast acid splash on him is the funniest fucking thing I’ve seen
FINALLY! You made a D&D video, I could not ask for anything else.
Now I wanna play d&d
The movie was pretty cool
This is incredible timing; my friend just started to learn how to be a dungeons and dragons DM for the first time, now me, my one friend and my boyfriend are all campaigning!!! we had our first ever session last night!
Amazing xD
I really appreciate the cat memes. Nice Easter eggs
Meanwhile in my country I hardly ever can find anyone who has ever heard about DnD!! Poland is so bad with it....
Jaiden as a dragonborn is so cute
Mannn i love dnd !! Me and my friends have been on one campaign for about a year now! Im so excited you played this!!
The part where jaiden ( zuke ) breathes acid on that clay worm and worm dissapears was one of the best moments on the video   Also jaiden can you tell how did you guys played , i wanna try my own D&D so i wanna learn ...i never played it before like you
Welcome to the club, Jaiden! You have not only passed the test of D&D, but surpassed it with your quick thinking, skill, and chaos! The D&D community is honored to have you in our ranks!
alpharad playing as a larry named paul seems so juxtaposed from his actual self but also so incredibly jacob-like. I can only imagine the incredible amount of hilarity that ensued when he roleplayed.
you could have alternatively titled this "Slimcicle was my DM" and it would have just as much veiws
I feel like animators or artists will play dnd just to draw the settings for inspiration
Welcome to the dnd community!!! I hope you like it :3 it’s fun and I would love to see more dnd videos
i need to watch this critical role style
Luap being Paul Jr in the end actually made me cry, makes me want to play D&D again even more
At the start when the sheep burst in i was thinking oh they are playing a wild sheep chase! I loved that adventure. Then it got way more out of hand, glad you enjoyed your first delve into ttrpgs
I need to play D&D
YES!
12:54 No fking way it's the family guy pose
9:53 Adventure Time Reference!!!  (The purple horse)
I'm sorry the manger thing made me crack up so hard.
Realy like this, please do more dnd stuff. It was so nice to look at
the goblins where cooking the ice king?
Not the poo brain horse 😭
This notification made me giggle and kick my legs like a schoolgirl.
I could totally watch all these animated DnD games, it’s infinitely unique with such big twists and turns
PLEASE tell me I can find a recording of this or something
I wish that there was more.. It was pretty short but still good
Jaiden, Charlie, Jacob and Ranboo is a recipe for chaos
ok i did NOT expect to see a reference to critical role/ the legend of vox machina
My favorite video by you yet Jaiden, I would love to watch highlights as said! :) Promise me session 2 plz
Well, I did play DnD before, but just 2 Oneshot adventures of about 2 or 3 hours
YES!! YES! YES! LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RAHHHH‼️‼️‼️‼️
I love the Vox Machina tribute!
this makes me want to get into dnd... Any tips for people who just want to mess around?
I need more
alphrad as Larry was so good ngl
i did you like d and d? its fun for me
One of us! One of us!
this video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
Thank you for sharing your adventure with us all!
Fav creator + hyperfixation moment time to explode
You know it’s a good day when jaiden uploads a video
VoxMachina 😂
Team Mark Thompson
I love this so much! D&D is even better animated! and the acid spell got me rolling😂
The twist with Luap at the end was so unexpected yet SO GOOD
I literally played my own very first DND session a couple of weeks ago, based around DougDoug's one, and it was just as insane. I absolutely loved this adventure, laughing basically the whole way through.
This was absolutely nuts and I loved it. Every single character was just so unhinged and the plots amazing.
Damn, now I _really_ want a full animated series based on this DND gang of yours, lol
9:53 The horse form adventure time!
1:15 thank you for this reference. I will not elaborate.
Dropped everything to listen to my favourite youtuber talking about my favourite thing in the world.  You havent been living if you dont have 100 absent dnd characters in a box.
Now I crave more DnD animations ❤ This was awesome!
I’m so glad Jaiden is back at uploading 😊
whats the background music at 7:03 ??? i hear it alot and i dont know the name lol
Loved the video! It’s a huge stretch but I would’ve loved to hear the other player’s voices for parts of it, but all good if it never happens
This was,AMAZING
Yay you played it! :D totally need to do a D&D game with your viewers. Would be chaotic ngl ^-^
MORE!!!!!!!!!
Mark: “I miss my wife tails, I miss her a lot.”
I dont really know what to comment, so... How's Ari?
PLEASE DO MORE DND
But is he still in the time loop?
I love that Jaiden went for a Dragonborn character. It suits her well and the design is superb!
Nice Vox Machina ref rigth at the start. Pick choice
Nice Vox Machina ref rigth at the start. Pick choice
Poopbrain pony!!!
I honestly habe never played dnd. I would like to, but i dont really know where to start?
I love this so much!!
Luap?...🔁...Oooohhhh!
1:15 is it Vox Machina reference or am I trippin
hahah i love that i just came home from a dnd session and see this 😂🤣
So Jaiden and Rambo use their fursonas and Jacob's characters is just Larry
I HEAR LEGEND OF ZELDA (and Mario) MUSIC
this was just PERFECT
Loved the Vox Machina reference at the start! If you're super into DND content I highly recommend checking out a podcast called Not another DND Podcast. Went to see them live recently with a friend and it was so much fun! Great video and I'm glad you had fun playing for the first time
Alpharad just looks like Gym Leader Larry form SV
Jaden making a dragoborn hit home
I need a full freaking campaign of Alpharad, Jaiden, and Ranboo with Charlie as the DM
I'm uncomfortable but in awe
i never play D&D but always happy to hear story of people that play. it just soo random and funny sometimes
15:28 got me
The animation was amazing and the jokes were amazing, we need a part 2!! ^^  [its up to u tho, no pressure]
The amount of Easter eggs in this was hilarious xD
This is the most chaotic group ever, can't wait for session 2, my guess is that you will turn into the dragons ex-wife and acid blast its head
Command is honestly the best spell I would reccomend to any new dnd player. If you don't know anything about dnd and have access to that spell, take it and just have a blast
Gimme moreeeeeeeeee!
bro what's with the Adventure Time horse 9:50
Oh god! it´s soo beautiful! I can´t believe you played! I played a ranger my first game, I still remember what we did, the memories you make in the process are amazing
Why does Paul look like blonde Larry-
The point blank acid blast got me good 😂😂😂
Power word: depression The most powerfull spell ever
If you were to ask me who I expected Jaiden to play D&D with, I would never have guessed Jacob Alpharad and Ranboo.
1:25 dragonborn don't have tails though
I saw whole 8n a DND session
raid shadow legends
This so good keep up the good work:))))))))
I remember during a stream you had months ago you mentioned that you wanted to make a video about your D&D campaign. I have been waiting for this ever since. Well worth the wait!
:D
THIS WAS THE BEST
Inb4 this video creates a wave of new dnd players just like the Nuzlock video a few years back.
2:26 orc shawty?
Dudes if you are thinking that D&D isn't for you try pathfinder. Now I know I will get backlash but it's similar but you don't have to roll a dice for everything. You roll a dice for most things but not everything. Also different name if anyone still plays it because the books are not in copy than please tell me I'm can play right know because my Game master/GM doesn't have time to play . Oh and I am really lonely so yeah .
How nice that this comes out during my bi-weekly DND session
OHOH WILD SHEEP CHASE
What a story! 😁
3:15  Dragon Roost Island theme, man how I missed that theme song
loved this vidoe
THATS NOT PAUL, THATS DRACO MALFOY 😂
I love dragons :))
Super star saga music 💪💪💪
she really picked up a turtle RIGHT NEXT TO THE BEAST. YOU DONT DO THAT! YOU WILL GET CURSED OR SOME SHIT idk the black turtle thing is kinda ambiguous
Finally
Pov : I CAST THUNDERSPELL!
Once, I needed a new character, so I made a guy, and her backstory was that she was originally a chair, but was permanently polymorphed into a half-elf woman named Ivellios, and halfway through the campaign, she walked into an anti-magic field, causing her to turn back into a chair. Everybody else was so terrified to go into the field that our ranger had to handle the entire fight on their own, and it took almost twenty minutes to het the chair polymorphed back into Ivellios. That will always be my favorite character I've ever played.
I’d be awesome if you had like the rolls on the actions. The axe boomerang HAD to be a 1 from Jacob hahaha
Yup sounds like D&D. Completely wack
I’ve recently been playing DND at my school, my guy is a lizardfolk named Acidicus. Me and my team have been traversing a Dwarven crypt, at the end of the corridor is a deep pit that was for some reason filled with pillows…that’s about it right now.
The adventure time reference 😮
Ate as always ❤
Hm I wonder what their intro module is gonna be   *sees the sheep* yup. Shoulda guessed it lol. Good choice
The subtle adventure time reference in the goblin camp
Meowboo has returned next time he streams that is what chat will call him
Pokemon I saw that fecoco
Please please PLEASE! MORE OF THIS!!!
I do understand there are some people that have never played. D&D... But I think it's funny that you genuinely thought you had to explain what dungeons& dragons is. And what a dungeon master is. But this is a fabulous adventure
is 10:23 a B99 Charles refrence? I WILL BE REAL HAPPY IF IT WAS !!
i do a campain as a dm XD
❤i loved this so muchhhhh as a fellow dnd player this was hilarious🤣
I can't believe you turned Alpharad into Larry from Pokemon. I just hope X doesn't find this.
Reminds me how my brother is a big DnD nerd and once i called an anime character my “bbg” and he thought i was saying “bbg” as the DnD term 💀💀  edit: 0:57 LOOKS LIKE SUSIE AHHH
I love the Legends of Vox Machina reference <3
Charlie fits in as an evil villain
So glad you enjoyed your first session of D&D! I hope you do more videos of your campaigns in the future!
So that’s what those livestreams were
Welcome to the nerd club, Jaiden
DEPRESSION
We need more dnd
why is there the dead ice king horse costume from adventuretime? 10:04
Adventure time horse
Where we can see this????
Bruh, you posted this on the day I'm going to one of my sessions. You just made me more hyped
loved this <3
Of course Jaiden’s character is a purple and black dragon
Hi
when zoot acid blasted mark, i literally yelled "noooooo"
Dude you always raising the bar with your animations everytime you upload. Your animations makes my day.
DnD isnt really my thing anymore, but i still love some TTRPG's. Like cronicles of darkness, or call of Cthulhu
oh mark 🥹 ...holy nvm
9:53 lmfao not the Adventure Time cow 😭
It took me a solid few seconds before I realized Paul is Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet but blonde
fucking awesome. you better do it more often <3
Love the Vox Machina Referance
One time i played D&D with couple of friends  and after we finished playing we didn't talk to each other sense that day
Man, pretty much all of Paul's dialogue, I can just hear in my mind's eye alpharad saying that in his usual way
I was literally just watching a video of Ari    All of them
Even out of pokemon..... Larry continues to haunt me
Hi
I cannot believe that Fat Pony was included as an easter egg
as a dnd nerd i require more dnd videos
I cannot believe but also absolutely believe that Jacob chose to be blonde Larry in a DnD campaign.
Bro I love dnd!!!😊
YAY NEW JAIDEN VIDEO  edit: THAT WAS AWESOME LMAFOA
This is peak D&D
JAIDEN :D
I love how Paul just gives me the pure Aoki/Larry vibes from Pokemon SV
I love this
1:16 And we see the Vox Machina group doing what it does best; getting pissed drunk
Paul is a vibe
Paul really had a Ron Stampler thing going on, I like it
The original live stream of this event was probably the best and most hilarious thing I have ever witnessed, and I'm amazed that you were able to shrink that entire session down into 15 minutes of animation. Absolutely amazing video
whats the name of the song playing in the clay battle part
Can’t wait for the movie!
Love the critical role reference
She finally finished writing her script guys 😂  Been really loving the streams and the direction your videos are going in
I love D&D… I haven’t played it in a while
Ice king, NOOOO!
That was a short dnd session
I want to play D&D but I have to many things I would think about so the game will NEVER get done.
I recently did my first dnd campaign, and it was really fun! Loved the video :D
Ahora tengo ganas de jugar D&D
Omg I loved this it was awsome and I hope you enjoyed it too anyway have a good day
Nicccccce
I’m actually so happy they’re all collaborating. They all mean so much to me and are very important so this is almost a dream come true of a video!!
Jaiden when are you gona play whith haminasons
Hi
*AND PROCEEDS TO ACID BLAST HIM POINT BLANK FROM THE MOUTH* Never knew Jaiden was a full blown psychopath:D
(On 15:28) DAMN THATS F-CKED UP 😭😭😭😭😭😭 /NM
I came from James channel earlier today
Glad you had fun. Here's to more to come
Fun Fact: D&D is named after their dungeons and dragons!
Was that haminations voicing the door and others
15:11 The most unhinged moment in a Jaiden video
70k likes with 48k views, huh
This is was so cool!
Omg, I had deja vu of this 1 year ago
9:53 IS THAT THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME!?!????!!??
I thought of playing it but I have no friends who play it no idea if this game is worth a try
Wait... d-did you just use that fucking fart sound (You know damn well which one) on the riddle door transformation punishment at 5:22? Or am I hearing things?
2ch 48kw 70kl
Is Paul Larry I know crazy
THIS WAS AMAZINGGGGGGG
At 9:51 you see poo brain horse from adventure time and i jyst LOVE that
No way I actually called it when the sheep was Paul’s son from the moment the sheep said he used to be human 💀
I am so sorry to any one who is reading this, But i have to say this. *Paul looks like england from hetalia*
Alpharad I literally just Larry and that’s fine
Typical DnD stuff... GLORIOUS
If you're still obsessed with animals and you come to my house I'm just telling you I have 3 dogs In 1 snake...
I love how Alpharad’s character is just Larry lmao
Bro really yeeted his son into the air twice
TURTLE FINAL ANSWER
Pls tell me why I was so invested in this story
IS THOLAMEW'S NEIGHBOUR TOMMY?!
I absolutely love this video so much, I started stimming so hard when I saw this/pos :D
I love the inclusions of Vox Machina in the inn, so cool!
the Peeler is the funniest thing in this entire campaign.
IS THAT VOX MACHINA
Try playing divinity 2 original sin game it a d&d video game on ps4 and nintendo switch
Wow, esa historia fue increíble XD
All the animators are posting 🗿🍷
If I ever had a nickel for everytime a DND campaign ended in a boss battle with a Walmart employee I would have two nickels which isn't alot but it's weird it happened twice.
As a fellow D&D player, I have never once considered fighting a BBEG by giving him depression, but that is quite possibly simultaneously the most creative combat tactic I've ever heard as well as the funniest  You've given me much to think about with my kobold bard, salutations Jaiden lmao
DND is one of the best games mostly because of the infinite possibilities and it’s not on your phones, tablets, pc or computers usually
Awesome adventure!
I loved it :D been a while since you made content worth watching. Curious, which dnd game is this?
Love the Vox Machina reference at the very beginning. And great video - welcome to DnD!
What a work of art, wish I was able to play dnd ;-;
Jaiden your such a good animator and I want to be friends with you
As an employee of Mart of Wal I'm triggered 😓😂
48k vieuws and 69k likes??? How is that possible
Oooo
Real
Why is there about 21k more likes than views on this video for me XP
FINALLY YOU RECORDED AGAIN!!!! MY STAR!!!!! ❤
That was amazing
This has motivated me to go and play D&D with my friends. Just let me find some first 😅
iv'e been used to you're art style for a long while. but i want a new art style
RANBOO!?!?!?!?? not wathcing.
This was so entertaining to watch! :)
IS THAT VOX MACHINA?!?!
yay video
I like how Alpharad is just a Larry skin 🤣
Plis more i am crying of 😂😂😂😂
Not gonna lie Alpharad as Larry actually fits and I wheezed so loud I scared my birds
That was awesome!
Paul!
I can't imagine how chaotic this session was (btw the video was AWESOME)🤣🤣
The critical role references were great in this
This video is the first time in a long time to make me laugh!
Definitely watching the whole video, but I specifically scanned for that Depression/Acid Blast moment first, just to see it animated. Easily the most unhinged D&D actions I've seen in a hot minute.
We need more D&D
I've never seen command used like that. Absolutely genius
@CriticalRole Hack sign anime
I've never played D&D, but my sister was in the Club for it, in Middle School and one story that I remember of her playing it with friends.  When they went to the dungeon, they found a pile of skeletons or were getting ready to fight skeletons, and she made her character instead of attacking, Bite the arm of one of the skeletons which then gave her an awesome powerful sword......no joking that literally did happen.  Each D&D story she told me when I was in middle school with her, I wouldn't stop laughing because they were ridiculously funny.
This was too good
Welcome Jaiden most craziest thing imaginable
I have PTSD from D&D
Lol
Adventure time horse
Paul is blond Larry ? x3
With the nnet worth of jaiden animations she probablly has enough to buy one of those really expensive DND sets and all the expensive stuff for DND
I loved this video, megalike
Me be like “ don’t worry, you got this Jaden!!!!”
Is that a divination wizard who flavors the magic as a time loop but because of chaos theory he still dosen't actually know whats gonna happen he just has a vibe?
Am I the only one who thinks this should become an animated series, much like her Pokèmon Nuzlocke videos? And then maybe those videos could be compiled into a single super video that groups all of their Dnd adventures together? Great job by the way, Jaiden, the dragonborn paladin character suits you ;)
Mark is basically dark universe Ron Stampler
Epic Battle: The Squad vs The Clay Monsters 8:10.
Ranboo making a crown at 7:58 with a big T on it, it's just lovely.  May the Legend Never Die
That was absolutely hilarious lol XD
YOOOOOO THIS WAS SO COOL AS A DM OMGGGGGGGGGGG
Vox Machina Reference in the Inn!
Kids vs dolls
i wont Part 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I would love to see another video of dnd :D
I like this new art style
My first table top role playing experience was of a home made game of Resident Evil. The point was to test if a new rpg player could easily grasp the mechanics. We were a group of 3 (two experienced players and me) + the game master. I... added accidental chaos to the game. To say the least.  I can't remember the details of the mission, but it's resident evil : go somewhere for a mission, surprise! there are zombies everywhere, survive/escape and ideally complete the mission.  So with that mindset : we were a group of professionnaly trained soldiers going into a national reserve? that also serves as a secret lab of some sort. Out mission was to investigate the lack of communication of a few other soldiers that were sent there. We investigate an old barn, but the noise we make fighting a strange, eyeless creature with a very long thounge (it's a licker for those who know RE) attracts a swarm of zombies outside the barn. We flee to the roof. At least, we try to. But someone... Okay, I, fell down the rope we used to climb up  and fainted on impact. The noise of my failure attracted the zombie that were bashing at the barn doors. My teammates had to go back down the rope and climb up with me while fending off the swarm. I end up waking up midway through the climb and tossed a grenade down giving us a bit more time, but also... Attracting more zombies. Now stuck on the roof, we must parcour our way down by jumping down to a shed nearby. Which I ALSO fumble my dice roll, so I end up missing my jump, jumping full force on the side wall of the shed and getting knocked out cold, again. With my amazing level of discretion, I attracted the attention of the zombies and so my teammates rush down, and drag my helpless meat sack into the cover of the forest.  I wake up a few minutes later and we push through the forest until we find a clearing. We are at the edge of a small cliff when suddenly out of the forest comes 2 very sickly looking dogs. One of the dogs rammed into one of my team mate, pushing him down the cliff and the other was detected and failled his tackle.  Me and my teammate still on top of the cliff, decides to throw rocks and branches at the dogs to try and fend them off our friend who was fighting them with a knife. We were affraid of using our guns and calling the whole damned park over to us. Eventually I get sick of that useless tactic and decide to plunge knife first down the cliff. The dog I was aiming for barely dodge the attack, but in my amazing comeback of dice roll luck, I swiped at the dog with my knife and sliced his throat in one go, nearly decapitating it in the process. One dog down, one more to go, together with my teammates we defeated the other dog, but as the fight finished, we could hear numerous barking in the distance, getting closer. We ran along the cliff until we found a weird, magnetic key activated door. We had found the key in the barn earlier and so, got in, closing the door behing us.   And that, was my first ever table top rpg experience and I'll never forget how much we laughed that day.
Wild Sheep Chase with homebrew additions always a good intro to DND
why the hell does Paul look like Larry?
We need MOAR!
Ain't no way the clay crown casted crown of madness
Dc has competition
Jaidens furry crawling out of her
I just gotta say, I'm barely a minute in and Jacob as Larry already killed me.
Wow 2 animators release a video in one day.  Is the world going to end?
Paul looks and sounds like Larry 🤨hmmm hmmm 🤨🤨
:O that sounds mega cooll
As someone who is about to play DND for the first time in the upcoming week, this video just made me even more excited to play!!!!
YOOOOO, VOX MACHINA!!!  Edit: YOOOOOOOOOOOO, Jaiden picked my favorite race!!! I freaking love Dragonborn!
Sounds like a pretty normal and chill session 😆
So that’s what those livestreams were
9:51  Adventure Time reference?!?!?!
This is probably the funniest Jaiden video I’ve ever seen
The critical role referance is so underated omg!
checks comments before watching the video _"What the hell happened here?"_
I hope y’all play again! I love d&d and I’m glad to hear (and see) how awesome this game went. 😁
This is gloriously unhinged I loved every second of it
Do more of D & D please!
Paul is the best character in this xD Instant favorite!
This is like a character ai chat
ill take 12 expansions of this please! :D
I LOVED THE PLOT TWIST AT THE END. PAUL IS MY FAV CHARACTER
3:51 _"And for some reason, they went along with it... still not understanding wth is going on..."_  This is every party introduction, ever. HAHAHA! Always hard to start a story from nothing. Everyone's eager just to hand-waive things away. and get started hehe.
14:51 The sheer emotion from Mark…  15:27 AND THE BETRAYAL.   I KNOW HE WAS BASICALLY BAD NOW, BUT IT WASN’T HIS FAULT! PLAYING WITH HIS EMOTIONS BEFORE GIVING HIM A ACID FACE WASH IS JUST TOO FAR!!1!
I loved it! I especially liked the Vox Machina reference at the beginning. ☺️
I loved this animation.
I watched you do this on a different channel
One word EPIC
Is Jacob suppose to be Larry from Pokémon S/V? Because if yes, I LOVE IT
YEEEEEAAAAAASSS FINALLY ANOTHER JOINS THE GAME
People that don’t play D&D would call this VERY weird. Me? I call it Tuesday.
Earli
Hell yes
Plot twist: that time loop resets the entire day once again, making everyone go through it for eternity.
You can’t forget the romance that you do when you get board
WE NEED MORE OF THIS OMG AHAHAH, please do a session 2
Alpharad is just larry and I think that says a lot
Story time: when I use to play dnd my friends where in a fight and instead of helping I  started playing tic tac toe and one thing lead to another and I ended up summing a demon called Ozymandias
Only Alpharad could've made the human fighter who is a widower and estranged from his son interesting. I love it
This was a fun watch. Was not ready for the depression command. Loved where you can tell rolls were failed/worked.
I love this vid I love dnd and  thank for this Jaiden
I don't know what you smoked... but that was awesome ! XD
this was fun
9:13  We all understood this reference, and we loved it😂
THIS WAS AWESOME
Yay a new video
Yes
It's always nice to see new people joining the hobby along with a great introduction to it like this. It sounds like it was a total blast. I hope to see more stories like this one from you.
I want a multi session, dark, depressing, and badass campaign to be animated by you over a series of videos
Please do more of these
Lmao DnD is an amazing game, I would absolutely love to hear more stories from your campaign if you continue, these characters sound like they have the makings for an incredible adventure. If you haven't already, I highly recommend checking out some of the animated DnD stories here on youtube (Dingo doodles Fool's Gold is a true Epic you don't want to miss!)   An anecdote from my first DnD campaign because Zute (Spelling?) spraying Mark in the face reminded me of this legendary moment:  We'd gotten into a couple of scrapes with Orcs before, but you could consider this out first big Boss fight as our characters, Tadeusz (mine, Lizardfolk solider) Arda (Half Orc Cleric) Slava (Dragonborn Barbarian) and Sariel (elf ranger) found themselves toe to toe with an Eye of Gruumsh named Gresh while attempting to rescue a local farmer.  We kept making low rolls and missing our attacks so Gresh wasn't really impressed with us, which was totally fine with us because he kept missing his as well, meaning we weren't super impressed with him either; Particularily after Gresh used a command spell on Arda to force her to kneel and point his weapon point blank at her face, and used a massive spell to attempt to finish her off in a single hit...And missed with a low roll.  We spent the entire rest of the fight mocking him for it, and Gresh did eventually kill Arda with a physical attack after she failed her death save rolls, but unfortunately for Gresh Arda was the only one in the party Tadeusz actually liked and she'd already beat him down pretty bad, so Tadeusz saw his friend get killed and dropped what he was doing to go finish him off with a triumphant "Where's your god now!?" that understandably got him beat within an inch of his life by Gresh's companions.   Slava and Sariel managed to hold the rest of the Orcs off, but all remaining players and orcs were one good hit from death at this point. Gresh rolled a successful death save with 1 hit point and mocked them as being next, and once again unfortunately for him Tadeusz succeeded his death save and chucked his quarterstaff at him from across the field with a high roll, instantly killing him once again and I used my bonus action to use Tadeusz's Second Wind ability so he didn't die before we finished off the orcs.   In summary, Taduesz landed the death blow on this guy *twice*, and to rub it in even more, Tadeusz is a Lizardfolk so guess what, he ate him afterwards, too. Gruumsh probably has it out for Tadeusz at this point, but at least our party had a happy Lizard
This was just as much of a fever dream as I thought it would be! Good job!
I'm not even 3 minutes in but I gotta say... Of course Ranboo is a cat and of course they immediately go to angst town  Also Jaiden's impression of Ranboo (and Ranboo's character) is really good  (Also also they/them for Ranboo and Ranboo's character,,,,,,)
Oh my god, this was such a joy to watch! Absolutely hilarious story, great animation as always, and overall just a pleasure!
I hope you do more animations like this!
Anyone notice at 1:14 there is a cameo of the Vox Machina group?
LOL, I'd watch like 100 episodes of this. That was hilarious lol. DnD is awesome
THIS IS SO FUNNY AND GREAT AND JAIDEN IS SO AWESOME
Paul Jr
8:23 It's wormin time XD
This was great.  Loved this
James and Jaiden in the same day? Damn it's a good day
DnD AND Zelda music? ... How dare you throw that seduce check on me.
Omg she called him ronboo I have been saying it wrong bc anything jaiden says is the true answer
was that for shadowing for the next session at the end
I want to see a video of this session you guys had.
Interesting
VOX MACHINA
My D&D experience consists of Oxventure, one session of Critical Role, occasionally watching Puffin Forest and Jocat, memes, and the start of act 1 of Baldur's Gate 3.  But based on that context, Jaiden gave me huge vibes of like the absolute Nth degree of a dragon blood sorcerer.
Paul being reference to larry of pokemon the hairystlye is the give away
gotta love my boy grog
WAS THAT A VOX MACHINA REFERENCE?
I'm so happy you had so much fun with your first DND group!!
Can we get a full dnd session some day pleases 🙏
This animation is better than playing the actual game
I love how ranboo actually became a little meow meow
Hiiiiiiiiiii LOVE YOU VIDEOS
A Dragon….A Cat…. And A disgruntled employee from Walmart…. Amazing.
I like the Vox Machina reference in the beginning
I have only seen people online talk about DND but, Damn it looks fun!
I’ve been trying to get into D&D, but haven’t found anyone else interested
If that's D&D, i want to try
alpharad really think he can just play larry from pokemon and get away with it?
RANBOO PLAYED A TABAXI
Jacob as Larry from Pokèmon Gen IX and a cat with a similar color scheme to Monokuma? This was really good! I know about D&D but don't play it and have seen it referenced in just about anything! Looks fun too!
Well, this went about as expected from a DND session with Jaiden.
I am 100% Zuit(spelling?).
We need mooooooooore
Out of everything, Mark’s son having a moustache had me laughing the hardest.
I recently played D&D for my first time, too. I wish I had friends to actually play this reguarly. So much chaos.
This makes me want to see a collab between Jaiden, JoCat, Puffin Forest, and Dingo Doodles. Maybe playing a session of Big Eyes, Small Mouth or Uranium Chef for Fate Core together. Just don't let Puffin play as Abserd. 😆
I need some help. I wanna become a story time animator but I get low self esteem because I don’t have “the voice” and that I feel that I’m too young and will get hate, but I really wanna start.
is no one going to talk about the walmart logo on Mark's shirt 😭☠
I never played dungeons and dragons before.
Such an awesome video! The dnd session must have been ecstatic!
I wish my players were half as creative to use Command: Depression.
I genuinely didn't realize luap was Paul backwards hahaha
I swear me and jaiden are the same person. I was just on a streak of watching dnd videos.
I got into D&D back when I was still in high school, with this online group that I still play in several years later. Let me tell you about one wild session from our first campaign (which ended earlier this year, the second one’s been going on for a few months). I rolled up a sorcerer with proficiencies in pretty much all the Charisma stats including performance, this will be important later.   So our party heads to the Feywild to ask the Fey Queen Titania for help getting access to the Elemental Planes, as we needed to enter each of them to find these 4 elemental stones. The Fey Queen is a bit mistrusting, so I, being newer to the group and a bit shy, chime in, “Hey, could I try to serenade her with a rendition of Never Gonna Give You Up?” Everyone goes silent for a couple minutes, then the DM goes, “You know what? Roll me a performance check.”  I roll a Nat 20. The total of that roll was a 27.  The other players and the DM erupt into excited cheers as I relay this, and the DM says she’s utterly wooed by the performance, and we get the info we need.  Now you may wonder, what happened with my character and the Fey Queen? Weeeeell they ended up falling in love and marrying in a later part of the campaign, and in campaign 2, are currently happily married with their twin children set to inherit their respective mothers’ titles.  In short: You wanna do batshit insane stuff you could never do IRL? You want a story where you can influence events and be who you want? Play D&D!
Now this, THIS is a campaign that I would LOVE to do
Why is Jacob's character literally Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet?
Are you sure Paul isn’t just disguised as Larry. (Edit: if you get the reference you get the reference.)
I loved this video 😂
this was so cool!
It’s wormin time
Man, I really wanna play D&D again
DND is so fun, especially when you are the walking shitpost of the party, I’m the completely normal seeming human, except… for some fucking reason I have an antimatter rifle, and yes this is normal dnd. God I love being the shitpost of the party
1:14 CRITICAL ROLE CHARACTERS!??!?!?!?!?!??! IN A JADEN ANIMATIONS VEDIO!??!?!
OH MY GOD RANBOOOOO
Alpharad just playing Gym Leader Larry is such a vibe.
Y'know you should really let the people voice act in your videos instead of you talking for them. Just an idea from me I mean no offense.
I never played dungeons and dragons before.
I loved this style of video!
New Jaiden upload = Good Day
Charlie just like top tier dm fr fr. Shout out to jrwi when he dms its just the best
I haven’t gotten into D & D. You should get James into it
Congratulations to your DM, that was the most insane and no sense adventure I ever saw 😂
i love this more please!*holds up plate*
I.NEED.MORE
The point blank acid was way out of pocket but was too good xD
hands down the best jaidenanimations video to date
I’m a huge fan of dnd so this made me incredibly happy! I really hope you guys play more in the future
Two animation videos in one day? Jaiden and James uploading in one day? Now that’s epic!
Alpha is just larry from pokemon sv but with an axe.
Jokes on YOU Jaiden I already play dnd and I’m already subscribed! In all seriousness though I’m happy for you.
Loved the Vox Machina reference at 1:15!
I love this a black dragonborn was my first character too
Holy hell plz do moree💯💯
I loved the Vox Machina reference, great video!
Ya D,&,D
I love playing D&D I played it for about a year now it's so much fun and the only reason I can play it is because after school on Wednesdays my school has a D&D club
Paul is just blonde Larry. Love it
THE QUEEN HAS POSTED❤
Great video.
Dang, I lost all my stats just hearing Mart of Wal in the beginning, then got even weaker with the backstories of Mark and Paul. Retail sucks, and Walmart tends to be the king of companies that makes it so as of recently.   A real nice D&D story overall though! I never got into it because it looks complicated with all the rules, the dice, and ever changing scenarios, but maybe I can ask my brother if I could watch a game if he's still a Dungeon Master.
I REMEMBER THE ACID BLAST ON YOUR STREAM XD
I loved this video so much.
So Alpharad becomes Larry the Gym Leader.
1:16 vox machina spotted
ngl this is either a bad narration or charlie just let you do whatever OR charlie is a bad dm
Now i'm wanting to get into D&D, and this was more than mildly entertaining. Also the music just made it 10x funnier.
Ngl an animated series of this would actually slap
Paul is my favourite character ever XD Just a blonde Larry/Aoki in a world full of Pokem... full of crazy randos and magic
NO WAY SHE REFERENCED VOX MACHINA LIKE THAT ONE MINUTE IN!!!
Plese do this again or at least not animated ones
I hope you guys continue the story and it gets animated like this as well
9:51 Adventure Time Horse
lol, again!! XD
Jaiden weakness should be loud toilets
best 18 minutes of my life (:
it's a good day
i love the fact that when this vidéo came out i was playing DND and i'm still playing-   (my character is going to die soon-)
Two furries and their larry friend
Dang! A jaiden video and an odd1sout video on the same day? What a saturday!
HAHAHAHA the critical role members at the very beginning I gasped
DRAGONBORN SORCERER? AAAAAH IM SO PROOOUD😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉 WELCOME TOT DND I LOVE THIS VIDEO!
CRITICAL ROLE MENTIONED
It won't convince me to play dnd, but that's a cool story
If I had a nickel for every time I've heard about the strategy of spouting acid/elemental damage at point blank range to a target currently being under some sort of mental effect to think they're talking to a loved one I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
Has anyone noticed the vox machina reference
Best of your videos
Can't belive I watched jaiden animating dnd
Love your videos I hope you are feeling good
That was the best thing I've ever seen! I'd love to see another session!
Welcome to the dnd community Jaiden. My husband introduced it to me 4 years ago and now I write the stories for him 💙
4:13 goated Over the Garden Wall reference
Love the Vox Machina cameo
THE VOX MACHINA CHARACTERS IN THE INN I miss them
This isn’t the story I asked for but it’s the story I needed. This is giving me even more motivation to force myself to family and friends to play D&D with me. Now to send this too my older sister
Is that sheep-with-speak-with-animals thing common? I swear me and my party had that EXACT thing happen to us.
Paul is giving off major “Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet” vibes
I wish I could've played with you all
Jaiden making a video about D&D right when I started playing for the first time just makes me so happy
That was a banger of a video lmao!
This was amazing.
pretty great would love more of these
For anyone doubting Jaiden's ability to be that stone cold, remember when she killed Pewds in Among Us?
I shall start a chant. JAIDEN ANIMATIONS JAIDEN ANIMATIONS Now your turn, fellow Jaiden fans!  ⬇️
Phenomenal production quality!!!!!!!
Glad you enjoyed yourself.
Yo nunca he jugado D&D
That was awesome I just recently got into dnd with my cousin and am going to dm a game coming up soon
Omg!  Two furries and their salesman 🤭 0:57
Vox Machina sure gets some competition
I love this and want see more animated dnd!!!! ( that sounds demanding I mean if you want to of course)
RANBOO TABAXI BARD
just realized watching this video that a fire emblem iron man playthrough (kind of similar to a nuzlocke) would be super fun to watch. if that were to happen, i suggest fire emblem 7 as it's the most easily accessible and the best starting point in the series imo
4:15 the beastttt :) also jason funderberker's names at the turtle!! so many otgw references
Is it just me or is Paul giving larry vibes from pokemon?
lol alpharad was larry
Over the Garden Wall reference? 4:15
this is great but i think it would have been better if this was just the actual session like if you recorded the session then just animated over i think it would be a little better but its still good
Ty for the video
This as great lmao Would love to see more
I'm a DM of my own party, and one of my players tried to fart themselfes to space
In D and D, I'm a dragon born paladin.
I love the fact that Jaiden's character has almost nothing to do with this storyline, she's just here for no real reason and gets a lot of story beats going just cause she's bored. I'm living for it.
FINALLY A VIDEO WTF
THE VEX KEYLETH GROD AND PUKE CAMEO ODHDKCNFNGNR
She should play skylanders
Why, for what reason, and how does Alpharad know how to make Larry (Pokemon S/V) in D&D? You know what... don't answer that, it's a totally Alpharad thing to do.
Ok but I need to here the recording of all of them 🤣🤣🤣
Haven't watched the video yet, but Jaiden + D&D??? I'm so in for this.
Love the adventure time references
Played DND today wierd coincidence
Can someone tell me how there are more likes then views💀
It was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
We need more of DND adventures with Jaiden.                 *cut to DingoDoodles sweating intensely.
impossible, Jaiden managed to harness the power of giving people depression!
I like how Jaiden is just Susie Deltarune, Alpharad is Larry Pokemon, and Ranboo is Cait Sith Final Fantasy Actually Hilarious, perfect Video
this makes me think of yesterday's session, we started the session planning a heist and ended as space pirates. I went into one of the party member's bag of holding so we only need to use invisibility once for two people, but I still had my bag of holding, and everyone except one person in our party was teleported to the astral plane with me and their items scattered, encountered a metal ship with some gith on it which we somehow managed to defeat, we're lvl 6 btw, but yeah, we're space pirates now
When Ranboo and slimecicle started laughing I DIS DO LMAO
3:14 Now DRAGON ROOST ISLAND?!? Jaiden casually blessing us with the 🔥🔥🔥 soundtracks!!!
So amazing made. Well played. Happy to see Highlights from the session
SO YOU TURNED INTO PAULS EX WIFE HUGED HIM AND THEN SPIT A ACID GLOB POINT BLANK AT HIS FACE!
The point blank acid breath as Paul's ex wife was psycho behavior
I SAW THAT ACID BREATH POINT LANK FROM A MILE AWAY OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK
If you're interested, there's this Youtuber named Pointy Hat who does D&D but gives different ideas on how to go about doing it. And he's funny
Turning into Mark's ex wife just to spit acid in his face broke me, this sounds so unhinged I love it
Lol im running a campaign today
As soon as I starting watching the video I realized that it would include Jaiden acid spraying Mark. Still one of the funniest clips
Dxfcgvhbjn i love this so much
That was an interesting and insane DM storyline
I subscribed because of the subscribe plug.
14:49 wait wasn’t there a short clip of this 😂
in the first minute a crit role reference, i already love it! XD
Beautiful, masterpiece.
I like that Jaiden is literally just Susie from deltarune
The guys in my DND group are just as cartoonishly unstable if not more so. My character is a Goblin rogue named Tuba.
This was so fun, the animation was absolutely on point I loved it so much!
I've always wanted to play dnd it sounds really fun and something that's right up my alley. I had an offer to be taught how to play once but I never took him up on that. I wish I had
Paul's design gives me strong Sanji vibes
I think if Jainden didn't said that chsrlie was the mester, we will eventuly figure out that he was the mester
watching this from the hospital ☝️
I can't explain how happy it makes me to see Jaiden & Ranboo collab/do something together! They're my two favorite youtubers, I just can't explain how happy it makes me :))
DragonBorn! Also, the idea of having a sigil on your tongue is so freaking creative!
Is there a podcast or a full video of this
I’ve only played dnd once. Don’t remember much besides one of the sessions being entirely spent in wizard dungeon
14:30 the scene I’m so happy for the context I didn’t know it was going to be here I love this scene
8:22 I love how you can tell that « IT’S WORMING TIME » is a very charlie quote
looking for the dva fart rn
I haven't laughed this hard in a while. Thank you :D
I would have liked to see a full voice over by alpharad, slimecicle, and ranboo it would be more of a masterpiece than it already is
This was hilarious and amazing at the same time. Great story, if you do end up doing a session 2, I'd love to see that too! All your characters are amazing and hilarious together.
play more pokemon games
As someone who just started DND, get ready for a wild ride
I NEED THE ACTUQL SESSION SO BAD Im so sad I missed it being livestreamed 😭😭😭
If you ever decide to do another one of these vids, which I completely recommend because it was fantastic, I would recommend having the players voicing their own characters. Just helps with telling who’s who in my opinion.
i NEED those highlights
a dragonborn, a kitty cat, and a DILF walk into a bar  that's dnd baybeeee!
Paul is the most traumatized of the group
very random characters, but hella funny story
Make the channel! I'd sub! I love dnd, great video!
1:15 VOX MACHINA!!!!!
this was really entertaining
And play Pokémon mystery dungeon rescue team
Oh yis dragonborn gang we keep winning
This gives off a semi less chaotic version of Doug Doug’s DND session with his twitch chat
NOW I WANNA PLAY DND I SWEAR TO GOOOOOD
Is laryrad
I can clearly see the moments they rolled and failed, this is soooooo funny when you have the almost a decade of experience I have xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Bro, d and d is like the best bored game and if you read this, you owe me $20👾👾👾
We need a series of this..
dndeez nuts
Paul is a mood
SUPER COOL video!!!!
2:39 NOW Coconut Mall?!? 🔥🔥🔥
I'm just paying attention on how you drew paul as larry from pokemon violet lmaoo
Why does this always happen? I said yesterday “hmm Jaiden hasn’t uploaded in awhile” and you upload today! This has happened before where I was watching an old series that someone did AND THEY MADE ANOTHER VIDEO ON IT THE SAME DAY I WATCHED HE OLD ONES!!
I loved this because i like watching d&d and playing it
Best video in a while, amazing!
Part two please 🙏
Love that Jaiden’s character has absolutely no bearing on the quest and just goes along with everything.
OMG jaiden do this agaiiiiiiiiin!!!!!
Could’ve sworn turtle was the answer
Damn!! This was a killer video well done to Jaiden and co absolutely knocked it out the park
14:08 SO REal💀 THAT HIT HARD WITH THE VOICE CHANGE
Wait paul threw his own son multiple times 😭😭
Oh my god this session arc is so cool!! The explosion at the end is a very nice touch. I wish more DND campaigns were animated like this!
Having Slimecicle of all people DM this game is guaranteed to result in the funniest and most chaotic experience ever and I wish I could have been a part of this game omg
watching the mark fight live was fucking bananas
Honestly I'd be fine if this is what Jaidens channel became. Animating D&D
its so nice to see an actual representation of how the best dnd sessions go, not as planned with hilarious bits and stupid moments which makes the best of experiences! (Also feels like the perfect group for this kinda stuff great video cant wait for a highlight reel)
... Is there a Vod of this full session somewhere? Or was this an off line thing for yall?
I remember watching this live in the subathon, it’s so cool to see it animated! Always a good day when Jaiden uploads.
now i NEED to see dingo doodles and jaiden plsy together
.
We see you Vox Machina 😏🤩
D&D goes crazy
Love it XD
D&D Larry from Pokémon Scarlet
WAAAAH I LOVED THIS SO MUCH!!!! You should totally do this again!!! >:D
Love dnd, did a one shot with friends last night, our group consisted of a tabaxi monk (me), a tortle druid, a rock gnome thief and eladrin thief. We were doing the lightning tower. Highlights from it include my tabaxi getting to group into the tower by making a high jump and lowering a rope to forgo looking for a secret entrance. My tabaxi grabbing a shield with the towers crest on it and triggering the trap which turned him into a fried kitty. The wildfire tortle swan diving into a well with fire spirit in tow the rock gnome following suit to help get one of the lightning rods and both facing a water weird. My tabaxi, not trusting a chained wardrobe that was shaking, pulling out a torch and lighting the room on fire while the tortle's fire spirit was frolicking in the burning room and found another rod. And the tortle nearly getting impelled by one of the rods as it rapidly change sizes. There are more highlights but none appropriate to say on here, like a running joke about tortle's anatomy.
Can’t tell if I like this or DougDoug’s Chat DnD session more. This is so good.
She finally joined us. After all these years. Your character also sounds really cool and it sounded like it was fun to play that character
Welcome to the world of DnD my friend.  I love spending time with my friends playing dnd One time our DM had planned a whole battle in a collesium  My friend jumps out the coliseum and accidentally kills the main villan of this part of the game and he becomes mayor and it got really political and we had to rob a casino of tiny men.  Also i play as a dragonborn  Love the content
that sounds like so much fun! i always wanted to try to get into D&D but the 1 group i got into, fell apart and just never happened.
When the DM is charile forgo reason and let chaos loose
Wild to be seeing more Over the Garden Wall references in this day and age (4:34)
IS THAT A CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE IN THE FIRSR SCENE????
D&D reminded me of Stranger Things
Alphard was just larry
omg jaden on JRWI or even one of jo cats games would be FIRE
I like all the over the garden wall references
I had my first session last week! Wild
THIS. Yes THIS. MORE.
1:30 wait why does the color of paul's tie change from green to black? is that supposed to hint at something? also the dragon character gives me strong deltarune susie vibes
i got so hyped seeing vox machina at the beginning
All my D&D games seem so lame now😂 I love the ending of yours, though! I hope you have as much fun with your next game as you did with this one!
The music choice for this video is A+
My friends and I are doing these one shots called Dark Star in the astral sea. I have created a new version on the Astral Dreadnought. It’s called the Elder Dreadnought, it lives inside a dead god and it eats other smaller Astral Dreadnoughts to gain more power. It can move through to other worlds and cause mass destruction and maybe even extinction of an entire world.
Vox Machina reference at 1:13
9:50 its that horse that just stares at finn and jake for a whole episode
4:18 i was ordering lunch from taco bell and the goofy bell went off right at this moment 😂😂😂
Tasty shows
I mist be crazy because I could of swore Jaiden said they've played before or at the very least alphaarad has..  Either way this was really entertaining and Its good to hear more people are interested in playing d&d and I love hearing their stories.
this is a great story
why does paul look like larry
It's funny😂, but where is ari?
I was… ecstatic when I saw this video I’ve been getting into DND lately and to see one of my favorite YouTubers make a video about them playing it. Awesome
LOVE this ep.!!!
Are you going to Vidcon Baltimore?
I had never shown any Intrest in this game, still probably won’t play it, but holy hell this got me laughing so hard like 5 different times 💀
this was so cool, if you could can we pleas have more of continuation of the story.
OwO nice fursona
I find it funny that i had my first dnd excperiance yesterday, and now this video came out, cool!  The campaine i was in was a one shot and lasted for 8 hours
I love alpharad looking like larry
Of COURSE Jaiden picks a black dragonborn. Her love for  Digimon style won the day.
Oh my gosh this was amazing! Please do more!
1:14 VOX MACHINAAAAAA
I feel like Red from osp and Jaiden would vibe a lot
Ah classic DnD chaos. I've described the game as "Shrek the Table Top RPG" and I think video this a good way to explain my poiny
1 minute in and Vox Machina are already there!!!!
1:00 The Outset Island Music!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
I was getting emotional for the manager, until Jaiden tried to kill him with acid breath
dude mark is so evil yet sympathetic hes perfect
Wow James AND Jaiden posted in a day Wohoo🎉
In addition to wearing the Pepsi logo on his Ye Olde Mart of Wal vest, Mark probably sheepishly rose quickly up the corporate ladder after he had a bubbly personality along with the wool to mace spray that sheep in its possibly former human face.
is it ever revealed that Paul is a normal type gym leader?
a sequel has to happen at some point, maybe in a few months but this was great quick fun
This trio reminded me of Susie, Ralsei, and Kris. its perfect.
I Hope you see this just so that you know that I LOVE THIS CONTENT AND WANT TO SEE MORE PLEASE.
D&D is awesome
Gorgeous video and loved the adventure time horse ref 👀 would love a part 2 :0 🩵🩵
Nice Critical Role references 😊
BAHAHHA ONCOR ONCOR BRAVO LMFAO 😂
Alr next video: warhammer
We need more I loved this
0:57 LOL IS THAT LARRY FROM POKÉMON AS ALPHARAD?
wuh
I could not stop grinning as I watched this chaotic masterpiece unfold, fantastic work!! Hope to see another one of these D&D adventures soon :3
Alpharad/paul is just like larry🤣
Wait a few days ago i was like hmm i wonder if Jaiden has played d&d
Jaiden. I Respect Your Sexuality. But I Need To Get This Off My Chest. WHY'S YOUR CHARACTER SO THICC IN HER THIGHS?!?!
this is why I need to try D&D
Hell yeah! More D&D!
.
i laughed so hard
Funny how you end up being rude and then ask others in the guideline not to be...you ruined the d&d session
WALCOME TO D&D!
I love 😍 with all you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
RONBOO COLAB YOOOO,
Alpha  looks like Larry
i love how paul is just larry from pokemon
That was fun.
The fact that Paul is basically Larry from Scarlet and Violet is awesome
I Love the chaos of D&D glad you enjoyed it too. Truly a great video
Lessss GOOO!
Very fun! More of these would be AWESOME. Especially with the animations. Your content really is at its best when you put the "Animations" in "Jaiden Animations". I absolutely love D&D, even though my experience is limited to a few of the PC games. I continue writing characters for it just because I like writing characters for stuff, but legit inserting Walmart into a campaign would NOT have occurred to me. Time for me to expand my creative options for D&D now, lol.
Of course Jacob is a goddamn Larry
I can clearly tell that Charlie Slimcicle was the DM JUST from every single event that took place.
Podcast?
Not me wishing I had an easy way to play dnd now. I have a friend that is a dm but he's away at school and even if we did it over discord then he has other campaigns that he does. I don't do this with strangers since I have trouble interacting with people I don't know and I just feel comfortable with people that I know. My favorite character that I created was my personal character from the first 3.5e campaign that I was in called Rosaria Whitethistle. I've been working on her and wish that I could recreate her for 5th edition. Either that or create a bard and try playing a bard again since my first time playing one didn't end well. Either way this was a great video.
The fact that this story was so unhinged and just outright more entertaining with better characters than most big studio stories I've been watching recently is actually insane and deserves a round of aplause
I love Paul so much Nhuxsnjixsanjdsiabddjiqndidandjieqndqwindsiqjn
OH GOD THIS IS SO GOOD!    At these times I wish I had friends to play with too
i wish i could draw good and visualise my dnd campaigns
What is the final song played called smh I need it
I'm pretty sure an annimator DnD player is litterally the main reason you are meant to play dnd. Only thing better than someone rammbling on about their Dnd session is someone who can draw out their sesssion instead
This gets me through my toughest times thx jaiden
WE NEED MORE OF THIS I love how DND can be so chaotic yet so story driven.
I SHALL SHARE MY EXPERIENCE CAUSE- YEAH.   So me and my bestie were chilling at a tavern. There were two tables of drunk Vikings and two tables of shady people. The bartender was the only one working there. We both went up and ordered drinks as we were just chilling before the bartender stood up slowly, and said: “The test will now commence.”  The shady guys went over to my best friend and didn’t do much damage, but she got a bruise on her head. For some reason they didn’t touch me. Then the drunk Vikings get up like: “hUh- BITCH!”  so as the shady guys and the drunk Vikings are just dishing it out, I attempt to attack the bartender, but he dodges. My best friend tries to find a way out, but the bartender sets off a smoke bomb, and won’t let us leave. During the shady guy and Vikings fight, one of the Vikings get slaughtered by one of the shady guys.    Another one of the Vikings, overcome by sadness and rage, kills the first set of shady, dies and chops off my friends hand. She killed him.  The bartender, then gets a gun, and fires it towards me. I dodge it, but it has a boomerang effect. It gets my shoulder. After all that chaos, the bartender comes towards us, and says:  “You have passed” - toward me “You have not.” - toward bestie.  I then join the mafia, declaring me, and my best friend enemies. Days later, the bartender brings me to my best friend to kill her.   She’s an ice elf, as she watches in attack towards me, weakening my attack. I return the attack, but for some reason, my luck was just out of the roof, because when I attacked her, I rolled a twenty. So I chopped off her leg, decapitated her, and send a sphere through her head as it was still conscious.  So yeah, best friend died, and I just climbed up in the mafia.
That is one of the best stories I've ever heard. Hands down, I'm actually kind of serious.
I'm stealing this for a one-shot
please just upload all the streams from the subathon.
Then proceeded to acid blast him in the face.
ok that went dark quick
I've never wanted anything  more than to have the power to shout "DEPRESSION" and cause immediate distress. Absolutely a game changer🤣
its insane how every D&D group normally only has that 1 person who eats any substance they come across but this group got 3
Okay this was actually pretty fun. I'd love to see more campaigns animated by you and your team in the future.
lol nice video jaiden keep up the good work
It was so fun to see the adventures of Zoot, Paul and Bard Tholomew! (Also, Zoot would look awesome as a plush, just saying...)
I would like to play this But I have no friend You might say No friends? Sadge😢
Yoooooooooooo
🎉
When’s the dnd podcast coming?
I think a toxic  relationship AAA style meeting would be a great place to start a dnd session
the does not know how long it acted for this vid
D&D  i found a podcast about that seems good
What was your class?
This was absolutely amazing sjsjsjjss I think I'm gonna try dnd on my own soon cuz this sounds hella fun!
The entire time I had a sense of déjà vu, then the scene with the manager's ex-wife starts and I'm like "and then she point blank acid sprays him, I've heard this one before, this is the DnD story about those insane players who would rather kill everyone in the campaign than try and solve the puzzles" I can't believe you're the kobold from that story, it makes so much more sense now Also that animation was great, fantastic job
PuffinForest type content? Niceeeee
JAIDEN CASTED DEPRESSION AND IT CUASED EMOTIONAL DAMAGE LMAOOOO
What's next, Jaiden try's Warhammer 40K. If so, she'd know just as much about it as I do.
In one of my campaigns my party decided to commit arson to a forest and started a forest fire. Then one of us decided to do the deed to a flaming tree (just a normal tree) and then died. Since we all were level 1 our dungeon master let us save him by using my mending cantrip 💀
Absolutely love the M&L Superstar Saga soundtrack in the background lol
I watched the whole VOD so this was a nice refresher:)
I like how Alpharad's character is just blonde Larry
I remember that last bit. Is the dragon in the sky at the end a ref to Dingo Doodles's story?
A real video! Yay!
So in my first dnd campaign I played in I may or may not have released 5 ancient extremely blood thirsty dragon gods that turned me and my pet human shark thing (bob) into ice statues, another eats a bunch of party members, and adopts one of my team members as its child as he speaks dragon. Everyone was one shot as we were lvl 7 and they were able to be as strong to take down 5 terasks at once
Well this was amazing, nice little nod to Vox Machina at the beginning
I absolutely LOVED THIS! Lots of goofy and creative stuff, legit wouldn't mind seeing more of this stuff lol
That’s a weird Walmart
jaden clearly had lots of fun animating this. (:
Poor Mark man he lived one of the worst lives I've ever heard in a dnd campaign just to be bullied then turned into a worm
OH MY GOD THIS WAS HILARIOUS I LOVED IIIIIT AAAAAAAAAA IT GIVE ME THE HYPES TO PLAY D&D
Had to re watch the opening to see the vox machena reference
This is beautiful 😭😭😭😭
"DOOOON'T LISTEN TO HIM. HEEEE'S A ZEEEEEBRA." Make merch with that.
LETS GOOOOO DND IS AWESOME
Let’s see who can find every reference to this movie first.
9:17 Should have added the "SCOTLAND FOREVER" sound effect
My girl just Fooled a man into thinking she was his wife. Got close to him and SPRAYED HIM WITH FUCKING BODY ACIDS AT POINT BLANK RANGE! Thats why I follow you XD
Comment
Omg Jakob made larry
Jaiden is now a dnd player
sup back from who knows when kinda thought you were dead but hey your not love the video and I see myself coming back to see what other cool stuff you've got also you and everyone else who was involved hope has a spooky Halloween love yall !
Did Alpha really just use Larry as his character? XD
My group with the best name sfronk bonk and dunk bunk bing bang the magical wizard yes that was his name and then there was harold after three sessionswe got a mascot who was a flying snake named jeff it was a rainbow snake that barfed rainbows with raided a cult through a donation box poke his eye stole his pants  and ran we got a sacrificial daggers we surgical attached it to jeffs top jaw almost killing him then we when to hell some how and killed some cultists then bought some rainbow crystals which we surgicly attaches to jeff  who now has the powere to shoot rainbow laisers we attaches him to a donation box which turned into a jeff hammerwhich we launched with a trebuchet while we were fighting the cultists defeating them
W video
Nice critical role reference at 1:16
Holy cow, it’s like, all of my favorite YouTubers this is crazy
At least this better than dealing with my ex-boyfriend as a DM
THIS WAS AWESOME
Jaiden's Dragonborn has to be the most evil RPG character I've ever seen, the ammount of emotional manipulation is off the charts.
Absolute brutal betrayal against Mark yet, he’s mark, he deserves it.

Ranboo spotted
Fkn wat...  5/7, great story
As someone who has played many Black Dragonborns  the urge to lure someone into hugging range just to acid breath them is way too strong, I have done it on no less than 8 differant occasions, twice as a NPC while DM'ing  it is just straight up the call of the void on mega steroids
The start of the story is from the one shot called "The Wild Sheep Chase" its free online if any off you want to run for your friends
The break with Charlie and Ranboo laughing is hilarious😂😂😂
I would LOVE to see you and this same crew do an uncut, longform stream of your campaign. You were made for d&d.
Finally, SOMEONE picks Dragonborn when playing dnd for the first time.   (Also appreciate the tails on Dragonborns)
D&D is great but I’m more of a Pathfinder Person.
aye vox machina or critical role reference
No Goblin Slayer cameo in a DND video with goblins. 7/10
<3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333
Bruh full-stop went "My name is Yoshikage Kira" at the bar.
we need a part 2
Paul is my spirit animal
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DND YeAAAAAAAAAH BABYYYYYYYYYYYY
I love how you took what is basically the most generic D&D session there is (random group meet in tavern, team up for basiacaly no reason, go to a dungeon, solve generic riddles, and fight a boss) and made it the most interesting story imaginable.
Yes. This is exactly what D&D is
As a lactose intolerant person currently pizza, this was a good video.
боже перевод от яндекса такой кринжовый
James and Jaiden in the same day?!
I like Pokémon so I think I would like d&d Also Paul looks like the normal gym leader from scarlet and violet
I love this adaptation of the wild sheep chase omg
Finally just a normal jaiden video not a stream
Im really happy this vid came because I just started dnd so I hit yo see an bit of it, Tysm!╰(*´︶`*)╯♡
I was playing d&d one time and I banged on the mayor’s daughter💀
thank you so much for this i love your vidio's i wish that you made more vidio's about dnd and i don't mean animated
So is this all part of Ranboo's Time Loop?
I was feeling really down but this video made my day thank you
i listened to the podcast when it was released on youtube and i was camping,when you cast acid blast i proceeded to wake up my entire family with my uncontrollable laughing (it was 3 in the morning, they weren't very happy)
This was absolutely delightful.  I'd love to see more of Zoot's adventures.  Perhaps a yearly entry with different friends they make along the way?  I'd offer to subscribe for it... but i'd have to unsubscribe first, and noone wants that.
That poor turtle. Getting pitched at the door.
I think this is my favorite video of yours to date, loved how unhinged you guys were throughout the session and all the references that you sprinkled in the video! I really hope you do more dnd stuff In the future, this was a lot of fun!
Wooo dragonborn!!!
I found out about this game because I book I read mentioned it 😮‍💨
15:32 Without a shadow of doubt , this moment is the BEST 4th wall break EVER
Depression oh my god depression I am Depressed now
I. Absolutely. LOVE THIS.
PERFEITO
I just started playing d&d and I AM CONFUSED
I close my eyes and swing my sword and ballsack around (rolls a 1) alright I rolled a 1 what happened
i love how you described the failed checks or straightup nat 1's
I just looove the moments you can clearly tell only happened because someone rolled a 1, I love dnd so much
Why am I crying haha 😭😭
I’d watch their tv show also part 2?
The Vox Machina cameo made me smile.
Never played d&d but it looks like fun  Paul is pretty much Larry from Pokemon Scarlet/Violet
Who else has been waiting for this day
VOX MACHINA!!  Such a good detail, I'm so happy 😊
11:54 “golden rod” draws silver rods
I've introduced my friends to Pokemon D&D, might also be something for you, where your dream to be a pokemon trainer and explore the world can become reality
ive never played D&D but ive always wanted to this just pushes my want to play D&D
The best collab ever
do this more often this is like my fav video by you
15:25
More! We need more of these please!!!
I never heard of D&D and quite frankly I'm not interested . My imagination spands the last things I have seen so I would just imitate characters I have seen.
Omg i also just started DnD with my friends and this was hilarious😆 let me guess that the goblin who missed the whole time was Slimecicle rolling a nat1 right? Hope we could get another video like this😊
Ragna the cat edge?
Welcome to the wild and wacky world of TTRPGs were so happy to have you
0:58 your characters are just Susie from Deltarune, Nanami and Monokuma
I literally just played D&D half an hour ago 😂
Oh cool!! I always wanted to play D&D but dont know anybody who plays it or is willing to because it "is too long"
a critical role campaign 1 reference... in the first fucking 2 minutes... i see you are very cultured.
I appreciate the Vox Machina cameos at the beginning
Amazing absolutely beautiful. Almost as powerful as jrwi.
The happy end
Jaiden and Dnd is not a combination i knew i needed but I  absolutely love
Alpharad’s dude kinda looks like Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet ngl
The battle with the clay monsters is my favorite part, love how you used the Masked Dedede and Roar of Dedede over the two battles.
9:51 ITS THE ADVENTURE TIME HORSE
taht was sick
This is amazing, love DnD story times
MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE
am I the only one that feels bad for mark😭
the goal of the video for us... count the number of critical fail they've done XD
i have heard this story where did i hear it from
why are they cooking ice king
Wait, this is some Mandela effect going on.  Didn't you play this before?  I saw a video of you playing with a group of people, and you were this monkey wizard that was cursed with an alligator hand and you had a percentage chance of casting wild magic at random.  One of your bad luck casting cast magic despell on the whole town and freed this apocalyptic beast.  It had the same animation as yours, but was a bit rougher since it was years and years ago.
😂this was amazing
YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAH
^ ~^ b
When I saw my favourite way of spending time  with my friends in the title I knew I was gonna be in for a fun ride
OMG THAT WAS AWESOME!!!!! I WANT TO TAKE INSPIRATION FOR MY CAMPAIGN!!!!! Not the plot just some elements lol
I love that the ace went with a dragon character! Very fitting!
I love that Jacob looks like his number one rival Ordinary Salary Man Larry
Hi Jaiden, I'm from Bolivia and I don't understand English at all, but I wanted to tell you that I love your videos.
My first play through I was a sorcerer dragon born
I love that you included audio of them all laughing at that acid spit moment.
This was an amazing video. The animations brought the whole story to life in a special way. Completely amazing.
Paul is giving major Higaruma & Nanami vibes from Jujutsu kaisen
The end was ridiculously funny as you pretend to be marks ex wife
I may be wrong and it may be just for the funny, but I think you can tell Jacob has for sure played DnD before, because Larry as a Barbarian is something you'd do when you know the game. Like the medival fantasy races are always cool, but something THAT random and off the walls are from the people that have played DnD for a WHILE and have made MANY characters before 😂 Good to see you having fun with DnD Jaiden! A very well earned laugh for your first session too!
They, Them?
Wow
Please more,  taht video was So perfect 🤣
Jaiden have you ever watched "Stranger Things" if not you must its the best series also at the beginning the main characters play D&D
I wonder if Alpharad got inspired by Larry Pokemon
1:16 love the vox machina refference
Deltarune
I've seen the sheep start in so many various adventures that it leads into, I love it. ICE KING HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME AT 9:51.  in my personal opinion, the best jaiden vid ever
Ah my favorite ragtag group, Larry's Brother, Monster Hunter Cat, Jaiden's Dragon-sona, and a singular sheep.
The best D&D games are the ones where all the players are playing their own individual games of "How can I provoke the DM into killing my character as quickly as possible?" while the DM is playing "How well can I just roll with whatever these lunatics are doing?" Clearly, your group got the hang of this very quickly.
Aww, I didn't like that and had to unsubscribe because Jaiden said so 🥺
I love the part when the worm said "It's wormin time" and wormed all over the place
the day is still gonna be reset for the cat so that HOLE THING WAS POINTLESS FOR THE CAT
Bong Water
I loved the little Vox Machina Easter egg at the beginning
Played last week, started a bar fight,got thrown up on,tried poisoning the person,got ganged up on,nearly died,escaped,hopped on a carriage with 1 hp left,then my friend kicked me in the balls and I died
Peak D&D one shot. Hijinx, awkward and hilarious solutions* to classic encounters. Tremendously funny climax to the fight. Amazing video Jaiden
Hi
Make more of these funny DnD videos please, you did such a good job!
Lol! Loved the Vox Machina cameo
BOOBERS ARISE
Man today is the ultimate YouTuber posting
Can't wait to see the highlights of the D&D sess!
The party being comprised of a dragon, a cat, and just some average corporate office worker dude is beyond hilarious to me
The vox machina reference <3
James and jaiden  uploading on the same day! You truly love to see it
This was pretty wholesome actually 😂
The collab we all needed :D
You and James, uploading ON THE SAME DAY?
LOVE KEEP UP!
I love how Alpharads character is just Larry, but blond.
Dang Paul just trauma dumped on a stranger he met at a bar 5 seconds after meeting them….  Honestly that’s a mood
OMG THE HORSE FROM ADVENTURE TIME 9:54
YESSS I LOVE THE CAMPAIGN!! I'M SO GLAD IT GOT ANIMATED!!
I have only played dnd for a bit and my character was killed by rats in the first session. But I did choose our hangout and got a nice grave near it afterwards.
I played a very dumbed down version once. Was fun. My character was the only one who truly wanted to work for the king because of loyalty and not because of the King paying the most. Makes sense because my dude got kicked out of the loyal guard (not the kings guard, those are higher) before deciding to become a mercenary while my mates where some form of nature lovers (elves, druids, etz) or half demon who are all kinda being discriminated against (the kings priest really doesn't like the half demon or other beings who aren't "the perfect human race"). Kings entitled but more chill than his priest
One of our party mates suggested (me) that we cooked orcs to attract more orcs
Man, look at that horse. It’s caught the stupid. ❤
I enjoy dnd but I have too much adhd to remember what’s going on and I just instead reply” roll to light up my cigarette?”
My god, hearing Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga ost never failed to fill me with joy
Only thing I know about D&D is that it'll go perfectly with Jaiden's style of videos
I would like to watch the actual session if it was recorded lol
Very nice Legends of Vox Machina reference right there at 1:15
I tried this like 10 months ago, I’m doin it again  Day 1 of asking for outer wilds
"This was a different type of video."  It was indeed...AND I LOVED IT!
I remember seeing clips from this game and I couldn't stop laughing when I realized depression and acid breath was coming.
"I'm an assistant manager at Ye Ye Mart of Wal," GWGAJVSKANAK
Wait how does this video have 45k views but 56k likes?
Why didn't you go on an adventure with Vax machina
PLEASSEEEEEEE this has to be a series now I am on my hands and knees
1:13 that Vox Machina reference though
I’m sorry…RONBOO?!
13:35 if I had a nickel everytime a d&d like adventure had an evil character based of a Walmart manager I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice
I really love the moment when worm says "It's wormin' time" and proceeds to worm all over the place
Omg. I loved this so much do you all do homebrew creations?
Jaidens really gotta try Baldurs gate 3 it’s literally dungeons and dragons the video game
Still waiting on that Chat plays Pokémon Emerald animation
i member this campaign lol. best dnd session ever 🐢
12:16 i like that your using Mario & luigi music when they basically do a bros attack
"Ye Old Mart of Wall" BROKE ME! 🤣
1:15 Yep. Figured those guys would show up.
Do a stream on it, would very much rewatch it
What is the double or nothing riddle? I could not understand the door.
This was SO COOOOOL
i kinda like if her new look as a dragon
D&D sounds cool
DnD homebrew campaigns are the best things ever
I wanted to try dnd once, then i saw the length of the rulebook and instantly noped outta that
4:15 Over the garden wall hehe
Please play Godzilla Omniverse
This sounds so fun and now I want to try playing D&D!
Bruh, Alpharad is literally Larry from Scarlet/Violet
Alpharad really just did the Kira speech
Jacob really nailed the Larry cosplay
this was amazing  suggestion if you make a sequel: have the other players voice their characters so that they can add their own flavors to the video
Everything just sounds like charle said it lmfao
Jaiden doing D&D stuff is the dream I never thought would come true. Hope this can become a series.
Are we not gonna talk about how Paul/Alpharad looks like Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet... or not? ;_;
This was actually one of the most insane dnd campaigns I have ever seen I’m glad you had a great time! Keep up the great work!
It took me an embarrassing amount of time to figure out who was who
This is NOTHING compared to what I’ve been a part of XD. Though awesome story, playing, and animation!
Being able to casually have an office worker in your party is why I love DND.
Paul is such a funny character
I love playing D&D
1:18 vox machina!!!!
Omg I have my first d&d session in YEARS today with some of my friends I’m so exited :3
Also can you please make a video about u playing bendy and the ink machine
W VIDEO
jaiden. more please
Bro the last part where mark was blasted point blank got me dying💀💀
I love the cat so much XD
Ahhhh the vox machina character look so adorable in ur art style :D
My first ever character in DND was Mormier. A Dragonborn  who commited war crimes against Half Orks because they killed his entier family. He got arrested, but one faithfull night he managed to escape and now is on the run from the goverment
Likes: 54K Views:45K  Go home YouTube you’re drunk.
I hope we can get more of these this was hilarious
I LOVED WATCHING THIS AS A DM
you know this video really helps me. I can't visualise images in my mind so an animated video or a comic book is literally the only way i'll ever understand D&D
Charlie d&d sessions seem like the ideal times, chuckle dungeon was hilarious, and I have only seen 1 episode of just roll with it but it was great
Yee old mart of wall .
My best dnd memory was from my most recent campaign where I constantly tried to kill the king of the kingdom it took place in also why does Jacob/Paul look like Sanji from one piece
i have so many questions first one being wtf???
I started to play dnd bro tue bard kill 12 people in one move bro like what the hell
1:16 Yeaahhhh, Vox Machina!!!!
And of course Jaiden spit Mark in the face in this wholesome moment.
This was AWESOME! I really hope you do more stuff like this!
This was so good!!!
D AND DEEZ NUTZ
The amount of times I laughed!!! You're all ridiculous! This was SO much fun!
Paul is just larry lol
More d&d content plz
Dude I ❤ your vids and ari seems like my bri
Evil Manger Mark and his Pliers of overtime
Squidward on a chair
Why does alpha’s character look like the sad neutral trainer from the newest Pokémon game.
IMMEDIATE VOX MACHINA REFERENCE!
15:32 Ranboo & Slimecicle : FUCKIN DYIN
I NEED MORE
As a dm to a group of (sometimes) lawful stupids, I feel this captures the essence of dnd perfectly
1:15 Oh hey! It's Vox Machina!
Ahh Yes my fav DnD Trio: Monokuma,Larry and Susie
3:40 i sense Dremurr bloodline but ok ig
The DnD scene is about to grow so much
Bro alpharad being larry
Is Alpharad Larry from Pokemon?
9:50 Adventure Time Reference, NICE!
I started stimming excitedly seeing this (that’s a good thing)
😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
I think swhat you got here Jaiden was classic DnD  Also I remember one of mine nat1... I was Drow assassin and with the with other 2 players (Paladin and Mage) we were fighing some mini Boss that was a Black Guard (evil version of Paladin). During fight I got critical DMG so I falls back a little and tried use mine dagger as a throwing weapon. I even wasted 1 turn so I could prepare/get bonus damage. Meanwhile our Paladin was hand-in-hand fight with BG. Mine turn and I throw dagger... Nat1 and our DM decited that I throw it right but into our Paladin. And because of mine preparacion, sneak attack... Lets just say now not only I got critical low HP xD
Larry!
Lol at 3:15 the draconic literally translates to "Speak With Animals" 💀💀💀
Welcome to D&D😂
DnD the most emotional, wonderful, fantastic, extraordinary group experience to possibly live, the act of effectively writing a book with your friends or how me and my friends call it "selective schizophrenia"
Ye old mart of wall haf me dieing
I see all of your Cartoon Network stuff :>
15:25 SHE WAS SO INSANE FOR THIS LMAO
OMG THE PLOT TWIST AT THE END ITS SO SWEET
After hearing the ogre story I realized I had Shrek the Musical playing in the background
D.A.D
i dont play dnd, but ill make sure i use the depression spell when i try it, as it seems very powerful.
This was the most ridiculous version of the wild sheep chase I've ever seen. Go on!
This video has 45k views but 54k likes, what??!?!?
My immediate reaction would have been to eat the clay too.
i love it when the worm says "its wormin time" and totally worms over everyone in the room
17:23 bobby and cucurucho is in a jaiden animation video😮❤   + HATSUNEMIKU NOOO WAYYYY
Yes!
The larry representation is awesome.
Great
I think I remember this from a while ago or something
THREE OF MY FAVOURITE STREAMS IN ONE VIDEO YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS :D YOUR ALL AMAZING :]❤️❤️❤️
the animations are so dynamic!
Damn, I'd watch a whole playlist of this
Jadien is a black dragon born that can breathe acid and the clay crown is like a head crab but it's a clayhead crown crab leader of the clayhead crabs.
THAT WAS AMAZING!
I find it hilarious how Alpharad looks like Larry
textbook first session, very nice
Thought it would be a campaign but it was...well...whatever this story was.
YES. CHARLIE AS A DM
YOOOOO SHE MADE IT
9:53 adventure time horse !
As soon as I heard about the sheep with the scroll in it's mouth I knew which adventure the DM was riffing on. (Though they changed a lot about it, basically everything that happened in between the sheep revealing it used to be human and using the wand to change the sheep back has been changed. Even the sheep's identity is different.) I remember when I ran that module for my group, my party decided to leave Loap a sheep (He had a different name but you know what I mean.) and loot all of the stuff in his house, cause what was he gonna do? Stop them? As a sheep? Yeah, good luck with that.
Thai video was soooo funny and  My favorite part was when you became the spy from tf2 and disguised as marks wife than basically backstage him!!
I love how slimecicle gets his goops all over the place on YouTube seeping into all the cracks
Jaiden's unrivalled animations and DnD's peerless flexibility in storytelling is a match made in heaven.
Need a sequel
I absolutely loved the vox machina and all the adevnture time/cartoon network references ❤😂 DND is such an amazing wholesome game that really brings people together in the weirdest ways possible
Why is Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet doing here? 😂
Welcom to the cul... I mean club, welcome to the club Jaiden.
depression
imagina se a jaiden tivesse jogado no ordem paranormal
OMG VOX MACHINA!!!
Ah yes through the power of depression they won the battle...    Awkwardly
Loved the vid keep on going
THE AQUA FPS SONG
Write that down, write that down!
Great video! Thxs for posting very recently with long videos and great animation!
This is hands down what a normal DnD session is like 😂 love seeing Jaiden animate her first campaign go
0:57 LARRY NO
This is the first dnd story I heard wish you do anther video like this
Love the Adventure Time reference at 9:50
Beautiful s tier video Jaiden 🍖🍊
I HAVENT FINISHED THE VIDEO YET BUT AAAAAAHHH VOX MACHINA REFERENCE AT 1:15 !!! Also so cool to see you getting into my faorite game Jaiden :DD
This is epic
damn i wanna play sessions like this hahaha! I feel for mark :(
Nice:3
15:20 the drama 😂
I love this, reminds me of one of my current campaigns. It's Dungeons and Devil Fruits (it's one piece dnd) where half of us are murder hobos and I used minor illusion to trick a bunch of enemies to get distracted by the rainbow dancing pug gif (you know the one) I have never seen my DM so disappointed before
15:08 …..this is sad ….. 15:29 wtf…..miss  Whyyy Noooo poor mark…. :(
I've run a game so similar to this. I found it on Dungeon Master's Guild
Man, this sounds like fun. I hope you had fun. This sounds like it would be so much fun, if you do more, I would love to give ideas and even play.
i missed the animation videos this was really good
Where to watch it
I love how Zoot is just along for the ride for most of it
Okay, about Oak trees. You know, despite the fact it is very expensive hard wood, it is fragile af. It dies at any opportunity it has. And boy, having Inn inside is the most opportunity of opportunities!
I was playing dnd and i seduced a bandit and some crazy things went down and i almost died
THATS CRAZY OMG I LOVED THAT
THIS WAS AWESOME!!!!👍👍👍
This was amazing!
I am a DM so This video went and made my day.
Paul looks hot
OMG THATS WAS SO COOL NOW I THINK DND IS AWESOME I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT BEFORE 😂
Love the Vox Machina reference
One time, I was playing D&D with my friends, and we had just beat a big boss sorta guy, and it was my turn to take an action. I said, “I poof.” Like disappearing. But the DM thought I said, “I poop.” And rolled the dice. It rolled a 20.
hun wake up, Jaiden just posted
Its now real if Jaiden was furry she would be Dragon XD
Yeah, that sounds like a typical D&D session. Nice to see you all didn't get up to anything Too Weird. 😜 😝 😂
When I started to play D&D, everything was fun and games until I got introduced to:     *The Character Sheet* 🗿
PLEASE MORE OF THIS YESSSS
Jaiden who would win in a fight saitama or shrek
This sounds fun AF
Poor guys🥲 Everyone. They were suffered so much... Except Jaiden🤣
I like how Paul is just blonde Larry from pokemon
This was so fun to watch live! W the animatiors and the character designers!!!!!! A fun stream and an awesome video!!!
I LOVED THIS SO MUCHHHHH
more of this, that was a great video!!!
I just started DnD too! My character is a failed businessman who's addicted to coffee
Ah yes I love kidnapping turltes
I would literally die for Bartholomew
i remember seeing the acid blast clip months before so when I realized this was the same story, I was just looking forward to it popping up and it hit me again so hard XD
Not the smallest violin meme 😭🖐️
Love how Ranboo's time loop dilemma was never brought up again
And why was a getting deltarune vibes from your character
This video is funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
this was so cool!!!
“Bro wake up Jaden animations just dropped”
Seems like somebody been playing too much Pokémon  1:34
More dnd pls?
POINT BLANK ACID BLAST LETS GOOOOOOOO
Please make more this is great xD
This is truely one of the d&d stories ever
I’ve only ever had one official DND game like 6 years ago with my dad , sister , and my dads friend I wanted to play it again, but I couldn’t find anyone
1st hour btw it’s wild that you and James uploaded today that never happened before
Vox Machina
This was so cool! I'm not big on DnD but this was pretty fun. Also, Mike was being a total worm, so it is fitting.
I screamed when I saw vox machina 😭😭
15:22 my favorite part
Season two finna be LIT
Average DnD session
first
D&D is so much fun I was an high mage so I had different types of elemental spells and I also had an awesome staff that it could kill everyone in the party or send my self to completely new plain of existence and it was so awesome.
DnD truly it's a one of a kind
Just recently came to the DnD community. Already created 2 characters in a span of 1 week and still waiting for the opportunity to play a session with friends.
my first time was like all my freinds killed the important characters so we cant progress.  This week we are gonna start over because of it lol
Of course Charlie would make a door only passable by solving some riddles
Jason Funderberker would've been the perfect fro ...i mean turtle name
Is that…. Is that….. LARRY
yay
DND IS SOO FUN
Dragonborn Jayden is adorable I want more of it
This kind of absurd nonsesnse is exactly what DND is about.
You should try to make a video or something every session, I know it's hard to animate that fast so maybe a few low quality and more story telling videos rather than being appealing to the human eye.
Charle and ranboo and perfect people for chaos
I love DND even tho it can be scary
I would 100% watch every single d&d video you put out!!! As well as force my husband to watch 😂
Dnd is great when you're not uncomfortable role-playing with your group. I'm not great at it and would rather do puzzles/combat, but with my friends, I have fun anyways even if I do or say something cringe. 😂
I *LOVE* seeing new players have a great time!!
Insert text here
I rlly love seeing folks dnd campaign stuff so this was wonderful!
Vox Machina cameo!!
This was awesome! I hope we get to see more in the future 👀
"ye olde mart of wall" 🤣😂😄😆  I like how the dragon has jaiden's hair!  and why is the guy's battle axe going THRU his suitcase??  😂😅
Very neat to see this animated, couldn't remotely understand the door though lol
Seems fun

We were fighting a drow that had information on our quest giver's missing brother and were supposed to "bring back alive, preferably" and a dracolich, when our druid asked our dm a simple question.  Has he ever seen a t-rex?  One high/low roll later, the rest of us were polymorphed into t-rexes.  Let's just say there wasn't much left of our enemies.  But it wasn't our fault we killed the guy.

DnD is very popular piece of crap. It limits your possibilities so much so you really don't need your brain to play.
D A M N Also yeahhh that's how DND usually goes XD
Bro that. Was. EPIC
Is that mark guy supposed to be Larry?
I hope I'm not the only one who caught the Vox Machina team at the start the session xD
So basicly if susie from deltarune, Larry from pokemon s/v and bongo cat were on an adventure in nutshell
The CR cameo... (Chef's Kiss)
That was... one hell of a story.
MORE DND PLEASE
I played a cat person in my dnd campaign and it is still my favorite character I’ve ever played to date
Ngl a Clay Worm monster yelling "ITS WORMIN' TIME-" made me cackle like a deranged Witch
Gubat Banwa is another great ttrpg thats a lot more fast paced with combat and has a lot more drama if you are looking for more ttrpg systems to play :))
Yooooo
No one gonna talk about how Paul looks like Larry from pkm S&V
This reminds me when in my first game I still did not know very well about some things and did not pay much attention and almost burned alive a mother and daughter we had just rescued because I was distracted
Oh cool
Every time I think Jaidens videos can’t become more unhinged, funny and entertaining I am proved SO WRONG
D&D is honestly one of the best mediums between storytelling and animation. Jaiden, I think you’ve struck a goldmine with this!
OH MY GOD. The timing for me on this video is everything: i had my first ever d&d session THIS wednesday and I loved it so much! glad you had a fun time too <3
Please one more video
This was so fun to watch. I've never played D&D and know nothing of it, but it was a very fun watch, regardless. I love you Jaiden 😭❤
Vox machina spotted at 1:15!
alpharad getting to play dnd and immediately choosing to just play as larry pokémon is so on brand for him lmao
The moment she said slimecicle was the dungeon master I knew it was a bad idea
Jaiden and Ranboo as a Furry Alpharad as Larry
The Over the Garden Wall reference was immaculate
I NEED A SEASON 2  ASAP
I love cat, Cat is good
IM THREE MINUTES IN AND ALREADY RANS CHARACTER IS INSANELY CLOSE TO MY OWN DND CHARACTER 1. NAME IS BARTHOLOMEW (RANBOOS NAME IS SO SIMILAR OH MY GOD) 2. I DREW A LIL CAT PICTURE NEXT TO BARTHOLOMEWS NAME AND RANBOOS CHARACTER IS A CAT 3. I THINK RANBOOS CHARACTER IS A BARD AND MINE IS TOO OH MY GOD IM FREAKING OUT  for context I've noticed ranboo and I have a LOT of things in common and are in general very similar in personality and I'm starting to get scared
1:13 omg vox machina…………
Paul is literally just larry
14:44 Oh, I remember this one... Classic
This was great live
1:15 VOX MACHINAAAAAA OMG I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE A VIDEO WITH SLIMECYCLE RANBOO ALPHARAD AND JAIDEN ALL TOGETHE PLAYING DND WITH A CRIT ROLE REFERENCE BUT OMG
R u telling me that me AND ranboo have a tabaxi charachter named bartholomew
Not Alpharad lookin like the normal type gym leader
Why your character is 2 furry and larry
PLEASE HAVE A SESSION WITH DINGO!!!
as someone who plays dnd I Find this absolutely fucking hilarious
when part 2
Jacob just being Larry is just hilarious.
Amazing (real)
This video has given me the confidence to finally play D&D. (I have been wanting to play it for a long time.)
WHY ALPHARAD LITERALLY JUST LARRY POKEMON
This was so perfectly dnd, and I’d love to see more!
Depression is not a command. You could have used "cry" or "vomit" or "fall."
ok that was cool
This is my favorite YOUTUBE video... possibly ever. Def for this week. And definitely has a high place in my personal pantheon of D&D videos.
heres a fun fact: if you comment on a video within the first 2 hours, youre automatically better than everybody after.
I like how at 1:14 it shows the campaign 1 criticle roll characters.
wtf you know ranboo? how youtube people always know each other that's so random
At 17:43 the bagpipes was so cool and such a good tactic
Jaden is the definition of quality over quantity
I’ve been waiting for this video
the door is my favorite character
I want to play D&D too ,i been Watching people play D&D for a long time But I have no friend  And I’m bad with people
PART 2 PLEASE I AM BEGGING YOU
this was a great one off. one of the better campaigns I've seen.
You now... when I was a kid... I think your cool...
bro me and my friends play d&d and OMG UR A DRAGONBORN SAME anyways we were talking about when ur next vid will come out and here it is about d&d
👍
Cool video
You know Ranboo?
Omg I forgot all about this session until the depression acid blast combo truly one of the most insane moments of all time I remember crying laughing the first time I heard that
Ooh I love the super star saga music!
Lol a man in a  business suit in a fantasy seting... sound about right 😅
Dragonborn. Respect
love your vids
WHERE CAN WE WATCH THE FULL SESSION IM DYING TO KNOW
could you maybe upload an unedited raw dnd please? id actually love to see it
THIS IS BYFAR THE BEST VIDEO YOU’VE EVER MADE. The acid blast made me fall off of my bed from laughter
D&D + Jaiden = LOVE more of this please! Thank you so much I feel like you might be able turn any long form table top game into a good video with the right scripting. I’m a fan of game called Clank! Not exactly “long form”, but it’s fun!
Omg I demand a session 2 and 3 and 4 and
Woo! My two favorite things, animation and DND!
THE CRIT ROLE REFRENCE!
10:04 Not the horse from adventure time💀
Okay,I absolutely love Jaiden's fursona;she looks really great as a dragon! And was this DnD campaign based off of DougDoug's DnD campaign? Because I picked up on a lot of similar elements from it.
9:50 isnt that ice king's horse costume :D?
The Command depression was awesome!!  EDIT: I can’t believe you left out your character’s Devil Pact
That song at the end is a BOP!
that was quite literally  the mos fun ive had watching a yutube video in a long time so thanks so much
OMG THIS IS AMAZING
This is why Jaiden is one of if not THE MOST Prolific Underated Animater  I have seen and your animations never fails to amaze me ( Not Discrediting others because I respect them and love their work Equally. ). Great Job Jaiden. Now if u can Translate this to check your Spanish 🙃.  Espero que algún día resuelvas el gran misterio del QSMP y consigas que los huevos reciban la justicia que merecen en otra dimensión. Si es así, ¿hay alguna manera de recuperar a nuestro pequeño amigo? Me encanta tu trabajo y tu estilo de animación, se siente como una serie animada dedicada a ti y tus historias. Que tengas un gran Jaiden. ¡¡¡¡¡¡VAMOS!!!!!!  Gracias Jaiden 🙏🙏
This should be a series. At least 200 parts.
This was awesome!!!
Jayden where do I send FanArt I love dnd and I love drawing please where can I send fanart?
The Larry reference~
You ned to do more of this
👍
That was an amazing video
Your storytelling is so good
This was awesome
Bro “luap” was actually so clever 😭
that was so fun makes me wanna try out dnd again, my first campaign was a bit too serious from what I was expecting 😅 tho I still love the concept of dnd
Jaiden is back!?!❤❤
Hey I played be fore and I adopted a lil tel goblin as my child
DND IS GOATEDDDD 💪💪🔥🔥 Epic that you picked a Dragonborn, I always pick Dragonborn :D
More
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE TIME LOOP???
I love it
Lop
Yes! Ive been so thirsty for content!
I was waiting so long just to see jaiden shout depression animated an it was so worth it😂
Lost it with the tiny violin😂🤣🤣
I love how you can tell what they rolled whenever they fail at something in an absurd way
MORE
I would have absolutely eaten the clay before the door starts talking
I'm not really crazy about D&D, but I wasn't crazy about Harry Potter either now I LOVE it!! I think I just need to try it out.  I LOVE YOUR VIDEOSSSSSSS
Is that vox machina i see
I loved the part when the Worm said "It's worming time!" Truly one of the clay monsters of all time.
the Wind Waker, Superstar Saga and Mario Galaxy music through out the video has made so much memories flood back!!! 💕
The quality of animation never ceases to amaze me. Amazing job Jaiden Team! ❤
4:42 I know what to do! “Please open!”
Man... My autism is so happy right now!   All of my hyper fixation creators coming together made me so happy.  This genuinely made my whole year better, for a full 10 minutes I was screaming into my pillow with genuine joy! I haven't been this happy in quiet a while, so thank you so much Jaiden, Charlie, Ranboo and Alpha! ❤❤❤❤
NOT YEE OLD MART OF W A LL
Love the vox machina cameo! Also amazing video, as someone who just recently started playing dnd this is awesome!
You need to do more D&D videos like this
JAMES, JAIDEN AND MR BEAST UPLOADING NEW VIDEOS ON THE SAME DAY??? LETS GOOOO
Gosh dang there's so many ones I can feel it xD
This is amazing, I'm so glad you got to play DND finally, it's such a blast
I rolled to attack Jaden  20+ my strength which is then five so that’s a 25  Does that break your AC
Omg hi
Just looking at the thimbnail, I’m really excited. I know this Ranboo, Jaiden and Alpharad are gonna be chaotic as hell. This is gonna be fun and i’m gonna be rewatching this for days.
"ye old mart of wal" has to be my favorite term for the store
season 2 season 2!
Why am I not surprised that Ranboo’s character is a cat
Poor Larry, I feel sorry for him and the quest hasn't even begun yet.
i didnt even process this as a jaiden video at first because i never expected this collab at all
Holly, this was a good game.
(1:15) I love the Vox Machina / Critical Role reference there with Keyleth totally crushing on Vex and Pike and Grog just drinking XD
I really like this episode! I've always been a huge fan of DnD and I'm so happy you had the pleasure of enjoying it as well
1:16 Vox Machina caught
MAKE A PART 2 IT WAS SO FUN TO WATCH PLEASE PART 2
omg the horse from adventure time 😭😭😭
SONG NAMES FROM THIS MASTERPIECE PLEEAAASE! (Mainly the ending one) THANK YOUUU JAIDEEEENNN
JAIDEN PLAYING A DRAGONBORN MY BELOVED!! this is the best thing to ever happen. incredible amazing video
My favorite part was when the worm said “it’s wormin time” and wormed all over the place
I like that a lot of this video is Paul suffering and hurting but not caring at all.
Broooo this was amazing! Now I’m even more excited to start my own D&D adventure now. “Sniff” I also wanna use a depression spell :,)
That is amazing, and I am glad you guys didn't get into a bar fight with the Vox Machina lol
I love D&D is one of my favourite games. I created an adventure.
I did not expect Alpharad’s character design to be based on Larry Pokemon
Holy shit this was amazing!!!!
This is the best thing I have ever seen. I love DND
lol this sounds like it was silly fun
D And D? Hmm soundw Interesting
Jaiden using Command to cast depression and DM allowing it despite it not being an action to follow because it's funny is truly peak DnD
Can you play Undertale
LARRYPHARAD
Vox Machina as a Easter egg brilliant 😎
Hey today is DND day for me and well we have had some adventures.
As a long time jaiden and ranboo fan, not to mention dnd fan this gave me a lot of serotonin
WHAT did you do jaiden!? You turned into a furryyyyy!!
this was simultaneously the most compelling story and the most meme-like D&D experience I've yet seen
God I loved the Vox Machina refrence
The sheep went on a ram-page
We need a session 2
I loved this!
not paul trauma dumping in the beggining
cute! love the new content! keep up the amazing work <3
Amazing how Jacob straight up just became Larry for D&D
I love how the entire party comprises of a furry (Ranboo), a Deltarune character (Jaiden), a random BEEP BEEP Sheep, and Nanami from JJK (Alphared).
DnD + Animation = BEST VIDEO EVER!! ❤
this is awesome. i need to watch more of Charlie DM-ing
Jaiden: "Born and raised!" Alpharad: "i wish i was"  Man i love this duo
OH MY GOSH THIS IS ABSOLUTARLY SICK!!! im playing with my own friends for the first time ever too, and this gave me the motivation to continue working on my character HEHAH amazing video as always!! <3
ah yes zelda music is perfect for this
The adventure they played, rightly modified by the DM to fit the group, is A Wild Sheep Chase by Winghorn Press. For those that were curious
I just want to say I'm excited for when I can drive and I can get into DnD I've been wanting to do it for so long and I just got 2 more years until I can start driving were I can get into it. But for now thanks for making this video to hold me over you should make more videos like this.😃
1:15 VOX MACHINA!!
1:14 jayden throwing in vox machina in the beginning is awesome and just a little fun nod to some of the biggest dnd creators
I tried DND but the version that we had had us choose a premade character which was awful for me. Perhaps I’ll find a version that does let me create a character and enjoy that much more
Omg, this is SO ENTRATAINING!
Please make more
YE OLD MART OF WALL
1:14 i recognize a critical role easter egg when i see one ^^'  Cool that you Like DnD, going to start a new Campaigne with my Friends in a few days.
Well, isn't this a nice change of pace for Jaiden! Who's the DM? *Slimecicle*  *O H  G O D ,  N O .*
I live how Alpha just decided to turn Larry into a DnD character
hey jaiden im craving more videos funny iv just been rewatching your old vids
I loved this so mutch!!!!!
The fact that Jacob is just Larry is amazing
I’ve never seen an D&D game before and it looks really fun! I kinda wanna try it, also I really like your animations and your really funny and relatable.
This so fun to watch!
The cut to just charlie and ranboo dying of laughter is so funny to me XD
I just started my first semester of my Game Development program and I NEED to learn the rules of D&D for my Design Theory class. What are the ODDS that someone on YouTube whom I've been subscribed to for about 5 YEARS now ACTUALLY talks about it?!!
This sounds so off the wall for a first session, but on the other hand, that is very D&D.
1:51 is so: My name is Yoshikage Kira. I’m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don’t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.  I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to anyone.
One time in D&D my sister kidnapped a goblin
God I miss playing ttrpgs.  My groups have been on hiatus
Lol
Jaiden: Dragonborn Ranboo: Cat Jacob: *Larry*
Love all the Vox Machina background characters 😂
I want to learn how to play DnD so bad and all this did was make me want to play more! 😭       UPDATE: I GOT A STARTER PACK :DD
I love the animation of the story when you made because it is funny to watch
So funny
Paul looks aufully like Larry from pokemon SV, great job! Love your videos!
lmao they ate the clay for literally no reason xD It was so much fun! I want more chaotic D&D adventures
I adore that you play D&D
wow, actually a really good adventure
You Played my Favorit Race Dragonborn wuhu!!!!!
The Mr. President name for the turtle at the beginning is a jojo reference
This was amazing please do it again
This is amazing, I hope you make more videos like this!
D&d using imagination so that means I can make anything
So the story starts with a Dragonborn, an emo, and a tabaxi meets at an inn then a sheep busts through a window.  Great way to start a campaign
YOO ADVENTURE TIME REFERENCE 9:51
Aha! I remember Jaiden streaming her DND campaign during that mega stream marathon she did awhile back and LOSING it when ahe invoked the "depression!" command. Like I had no idea Jauden could go that dark and nearly died laughing. X"D   Now to just wait on the continuation of Pokemon DUNGEON
Something about Paul being a businessman with an axe going on an adventure seems very interdimensional and I like it.  Edit: i just realized he's keeping the axe in a suitcase... Or as much of it as he can
I love how Alpha is only vaguely fantasy Larry
i love how jacob is just larry
Naked ari didnt appeard :(
15:23 who else gets this reference from one of Jaiden's unhinged streams?
I hope this becomes a regular thing. Animating a  campaign is so much fun to watch!
Welcome to the world of DnD Jaiden. I hope you enjoyed it
This was fantastic. I would love to see more if you guys keep playing
9:50 Adventure Time reference goes hard
This is the chaotic energy I need in my life thank you
OH RIGHT THE "DEPRESSION" ATTACK !
And bongo cat
I am a simple man, I see slimecicle, I click.
ALPHARAD?? LIVING A DEADBEAT LIFE?? DEADBEAT BOULEVARD??
If (somehow) this is your first exposure to D&D and you want to see other stuff, I suggest Dimension 20 (especially A Crown of Candy). If you are wondering what A Crown of Candy is, it’s Candy Land mixed with Game of Thrones. It a hoot.
Daisy circuit supremacy
I,saw ranboo on the thumbnail and had to watch
what class is jaiden?
superstar saga music is based
I love how Jacob is literally just Larry
1:16 mighty nine!!
Paul jr >:(🐢
Love it
YASSSSS MORE ANIMATED DND STORIES FINALLY
15:14
More plz
Peiple who saw the beast from outside the garden wall 👇
0:56 yooo! Larry Jacob?
YouTubers scramble multiple times a week for engagement just for jaiden animations to drop random heat unprovoked.
I LOVE UR VIDEOS JAIDEN
It was funny and great and Jaiden is so awesome oh look at that a nat 20
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL
You have no idea how long i've waited for this 😱 😃
5:22 the fart?
This was perfect
This game involves math, risk and imagination-Stanley Pines
This is great I got to give it to you
was in the middle of making a dnd character when i got the notif. and was very happy when in the first 2 minutes of the video. VOX MACHINA JUMPSCARE RAAHHHH
Hello Ms. Animations, I am affiliated with Youtube and your account has been boosted by 1,000 subscribers to show our appreciation of your affect on Youtube
14:10 I saw a short of this moment, it’s better animated
Please  more this is so good and funny!
that was funny as fuck holy shit pretend to be is wife
That was a great video! I hope you do more DND videos later. I was laughing like crazy when I saw your live recording from your StreamAThon (?) I can't remember what you called it. And this just got me laughing like crazy all over again. This video style reminds me of a DND series I watch called Fools Good made the amazing and funny Dingo Doodles. If you haven't watched her videos I highly recommended it. It's what got me into playing DND with my husband. He says I'm the most evil DM ever.
I love that Alpharad looks just like larry from Pokemon Scarlet
Yeah.. the freedom of dnd can go sideways real quick!
1:00 already love jakop character
Awesome to see Jaiden as a dragon born!! It really suits her, especially since she is a fellow hoarder of pokemon merch! ( I am too and honestly adore her collection XD)
The Legend of Zelda music is a great add on
Larry is going to get twice as popular now
1:16 aaaaaaa the critical role cameos i love it
When I read the title, I knew the video was going to be awesome 😁 Jaidens content really has improved 👍
If I had a Nickel for every Dnd character based on Larry I've come across Id have 2 Nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
12:37 😂 wow just wow
Another great video by the one and only aroace queen! Could really not fathom what was gonna happen next lol (ps.was pauls design inspired by Larry?)
DND Jaiden is an absolute menace to society and I am all here for it. That "Acid Blast" scene god I wish I could see that moment when it first happened during the DND session. The reactions must've been priceless.
What’s dnd? I heard of it I just don’t know what it’s about because I never played it before
that was epic! would absolutely love to see a part two (or a highlights video from this session lol) :D
1:16 she did not just she did not just putting on Critical Role Characters their she did cause I’m freaking out I’m freaking out right now
I've been _hoping_ you'd make a video about this since I saw a short clip of the depression spell and _man_ did it live up to the hype! :D
so cooool😍
Baldur's gate 3 revive this franchise
Bro post videos earlier ok
I saw that vox machina easter egg ;3
I love how Alpharad was allowed to make his character anyway he wanted and he chose to make them Larry
We need more!
That was fantastic, hope you have more fun with D&D soon! Also nice sneak in from Vox Machina at the beginning there lmao
Absolutely loved this, I love dnd and  this group's comedy worked great
Bro I’m in a dnd session currently. How did this happen?
i just Realized Alpharad is just Larry with blond hair dammit
This was soo good!! I also in a DND party and we are like pure chaos! 😆🤣
0:56 susie deltarune!
Love this
this was AMAZING!! I love and miss playing D&D and I adore watching other parties and campaigns! All your videos are great to watch (especially as I draw) and this one is no different ^^ Keep up the great work and I can't wait to possibly see more of this Party!
Great video ❤
ok
Jacob is literally just playing Larry from Pokemon and I love iy
Hearing the rest of the group laugh when Mark gets acid blasted was amazing. This could be one of Jaiden’s best videos
I just lost it when Jaiden seduced the manager only to spit acid at his face fallowed by raw unhinged laughter from the guys 😂
OH MY GOD WHAT A GOOD VIDEO I WANT TO EAT IT
HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY JAIDEN🎉🎈🎊🎁
MORE PLES
I NEED MOOOOORE
i live dnd it's fun
Leave it to Alpharad to basically just play Larry but with a battleaxe
I've never laughed so hard at a video
command depression sounds unironically good
1:14 hey wait a second Edit: WAIT NO THE POINT BLANK GETTIN HIM IN THE FACE AFTER GASLIGHT GIRLBOSSING HIM OH MY GOD
I've never played it and damnn!  DnD looks fun..
If i could put GIFs in, i'd use the smiling pointing baby one at that Critical Role reference....😅
OMGOSH. JAIDEN U HAVE NO IDEA HOW HAPPY THIS MADE ME. I js started listening to the roll with it podcast- and now my FAVORITE animator, my FAVORITE  DnD content creator- and one of the FUNNIEST youtubers (ranboo) are doing a dnd campaign together and its ANIMATED??? this has mad my day 4 times better
Would you still like Mark if he was a worm?
How did mark not die from a POINT BLANK acid blast
This sounds like such a fun one shot!
YES. DO MORE OF THIS, PLEASE!
The dungeon master is just hidden 😢
oh i lovrd the vid xd
Ranboo as a tabaxi and jaiden as a dragonborn is the best thing
With the context of who Luap is the plan to get the wand becomes WAY funnier.
ah the sheep with animal speaking scroll in its mouth rushes the tavern party.  Classic
Id love to play more dnd if I could find dms that didn't have issues with me personally or how I play MY character
4:53 BONGO CAT
It’s beautiful🥺🥺🥺
I cant for the next d&d animated story
the vox machina reference was genius
OMG JAIDEN I WANTED A ANIMATOR TO DO A DND VID THANK YOUUUUUUUUUUU
It was a matter of time, as a dm myself, I love balancing my party’s hate and love for me, I make sure they can do certain things and allow them to test things they want or get upgrades they desperately need
Yup. Thats a Slikecicle DnD campaign alright.
that was great. I loved that. :)
This was really great please do more like this, or you could do a video of you and other youtubers doing it in real life.
Welcome to the DND community!! That sounds like an AWESOME session and I'm so glad you got to enjoy it!!! 💕💕
I'm sorry, but Alpharad being Larry is perfect
YES, I LOVE DND, I AM SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW, PLEASE MAKE SEQUELS
OMG this is soooo good!!! Please part 2!
The ending… JAIDEN JUST BEING MURDEROUS, did she learn something from haminations about being ruthless?
1:15 Vox Machina :D Please more DND videos!
I would watch this campaign in a heartbeat
Music seems too loud
Ig jaiden is a furry now
NOT THE LUAP TWIST AT THE END!!! 😭😭😭😭
15:27 Called it!
With out a doubt one of your best videos ❤
My favorite thing about D&D is that, after the game, players tend to tell stories saying "I" did *this* and "we" did *that*
does anyone know if theres a vod for this i need it
What an amazing moment of madness. Loved it
That sounds so fun bro i wanna play but idk how
Love the vox machina reference
Hey, I loved it next time maybe let the ppl play voice their characters would make it a bit more interesting
its wormin time
This is amazing!! The party's...unique...way of tackling situations, and Charlie's DMing is such a perfect combo!
I loved how jaiden gave a guy depression, turned into his wife to lower his guard and then betrayed him by spitting in his face… literally. 😂
Jacob is basically Larry lmao
RANBOO'S CHARACTER LOOKS ADORABLE ISUGGEJ LITTLE GUYYY i remember a friend of mine talking about how in a campaign they were a cow cleric. like, a cow, but a cleric. cow cleric
I wish I could play D&D, but I don't have someone who knows it well to teach me 😅😅
IS THAT A CRITICAL ROLE REFERENCE I SPY AT 1:15 HELL YEAH JAIDEN
fortnite
im sorry DID JACOB ALPHARAD MAKE LARRY?!
I commend you for the Acid breath move, that was a gorgeous play and had me rolling
PLEASE YES I WANT TO LISTEN TO THE ACTUAL ONE SHOT this animated summarized version is so freaking sick but the whole session would be fun to listen to in the background while doing things
WELCOME TO THE COMMUNITY MY DEAR CHILD!!!!
Im not D and D fan but this was awesome looking.
I LOVE DND
Omg this made me so happy! XD
"DEPRESSION!"
the way you embodied ranboo so well when you spoke-
I legit laughed out loud when i saw Vox Machina near the beginning.
I saw this and screamed RANBOOO
The craziest thing I've ever done in DND was that a sub-boss before the final boss threw meteorites at us and with a mattress that I stole I made the meteorite bounce and hit the boss xD
This is awesome
DND NOOB LETS GOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO
Yeah this is exactly how I expected your first DnD session with Slimecicle to go. Pure chaos.
First 50k views
Love your videos love from Norway 🇧🇻❤
Weirdest D&D video I have ever seen. More please.
I was about to go do something else but... I saw this and I *knew* I had to procrastinate for 17 more minutes...
anyone else notice the critical role Easter egg at 1:14 or was it just me?
Daaamn, that was sooo clever that Luap appears to be Pauls son Did Charlie came up with that? That's some serious dungeon master skillz
jaiden and theodds1out videos on the same day
This was actually awesome
Ive been waiting for this day!
I really feel bad for that dragon.
The critical role reference in the beginning made my day
16:10 WAS SO COOL!
I have a big interest in D&D and I have a friend who plays it
“D E P P R E S S I O N !” Got me dying!
This was my favourite Jaiden video ever, I hope there's more to come from this group!
Dragonborn gang! Where you at?!
Best animation of a d&d adventure i've ever seen, and i'm glad to see Jaiden pulled through to write a transcript of the adventure and make this masterpiece ^^
Why does alpharads character look like nanami?
My freind seduced a DRAGON.
Wait the bad guy is MEE??!!?! what a plotwist
Gotta love that Vox Machina reference in the beginning.
I just finished watching jame's video and now jaiden upload a video!? Good service
For your next video can you do sibling stories about your brother jax haminations, infamous swoosh, brodyanimation, & cypherden did that category and I'm interested to know what kinda stories you have about your younger brother
I see vox machina
That acid blast on Mark's head was HELLA personal🤣
Hi
I like how the Business man is based on Larry on pokemon
I love these types of dnd recap videos!  I'd look forward to more in the future!
as someone who just became a DM recently for a completely new group. i can confirm that as both a player and DM, complete chaos or complete order can both be achieved.
This type of stuff makes me wanna play dnd.
Is Jaiden a dragon I see?
HOOOO NEW VIDEO!!!!
4:09 Camman18 is shaking and crying rn, I can feel it.
1:15 Is that a certain Vox Machina I see? :)
So that's how that infamous scene came about! XD
I realization that the guy's name was Paul Thomson is great, reminds me of when Nick Robinson was trying to find the super monkey ball announcer and two different guys said the last and first name of the guy seperately
The plot twists 😭 I need to play DnD
So Paul is just Larry right?
BABE WAKE UP JAIDEN ANIMATIONS MADE A DND VIDEO
So a Mario rpg but on crack
This video was great
Is Paul supposed to be Larry? From Scarlet Violet?
so cool how you animated the campaign and story as if it was a real movie/show and im so here for it
Yep... this sounds like a DND campaign alright.
Seduce all my enemies fireball all my allies
You should totally do this again it was super entertaining and fun to listen to. Me doing dnd makes this even more fun to listen to cause it’s relatable
15:30 *Proceeds to use acid*
Alpharad is LARRY
The first time I played DnD a guy got shot with a bunch of arrows so we chopped both of his ears off because skill issue or something
People say that I am a good DM
Amazing wanna play it aswell
I remember my first group, we never took anything serious, like we ended up going into a cheese village. And because i wanted to drink thr cheese river and I got dysentery from it lol. Also I really like that alpharad is literally just Larry pokemon
not even a minute in and Jaiden already tells me to unsub 😢
i love how you can clearly telll what lines charlie slimecicle said
I love how Paul is just Blonde Larry
We just gonna ignore CR?
D&D is at my school but I never played it
I am watching this video with 41k views. And 43k likes. YouTube you alright??? Also great vid Jaiden!
So Jaiden and Ranboo turned into furries. Silly.
1:13 is that a vox machina reference i see
I really need a movie about this! It's amazing!!
Finally, context for the acid kiss clip.
Oh jaiden would love Pokemon dnd
One time my whole entire party was kidnapped by an owl bear and my and I was like can I marry it and my dad was like if you can get a 20 you can marry it and then I rolled a 20 so my TNT character got married to an owl bear
1:45 depression 2:13 meowdy 2:45 shep 3:01 poor Paul 3:25 oh god it talks 3:47 very trusting 4:14 tutle 4:52 bongos 7:11 tutle I chose you 8:22 wormin time 9:03 get bonked 10:32 peel this 12:04 L bozo goblegob 13:29 and you Paul 14:07 sad moment 15:27 get dunked on kid 16:41 emotional return
Please do more of these! Love D&D playthroughs especially with animation.
nerd
Please Make DnD Content a Thing. PLEASE Make this a Campaign!
NEW VIDEOEOEEOO WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is like a 7th grade narative assignment
that was super enjoyable!
I love this new idea and it could be a great series where you just animate your dnd stories with funny twists for audience interaction
ME AND MY FRIENDS JUST STARTED PLAYING DND
8 years of playing dnd, this game is just so great, i've been a dungeon master since i started playing, just a great game
Ive mever played D&D but i know i would be a great player and i would have a lot of fun. And could someone in the reply section tell me what its like
I was never so emotionally engaged into something in my whole life
Nice one shot!  Moar plz!!!
This is amazing please do more dnd jaiden
Dnd is dogshit, guess im unsubbing lmao
Fun Adventure!!! Thank you 🛡
I'm going to need more of this! A D&D story with Jaiden's  Animations, the best of the best <3
VOX MOCANA (I PROBABLY SPELT THAT WRONG BUT HOLY CRAP BEST ANIME)
SHEEESH Critical role reference in the beginning goes hard
MORE D&D MORE D&D MORE D&D
𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗻
Yess been waiting for this video ever since the stream!
Why is alpharad just Larry?
16:53 them realizing is so funny to me 😂
3 and a half minutes into the video and I'm already loving it. animation is great and the story is just crazy I need to get back into DND, it's been a while. I just watch my friends play it and comment on stuff they do. I can taunt the DM and players, and they can't do anything, it's fun
Hello there jaiden
Just being Larry is the most Jacob thing to do💀
I really want to try Tabletop RPG DnD session but I don't have friends nearby who would I play with. TwT Great video as always and hilarious story. Especially the part with Depression spell.
Having someone to draw your DnD adventures after they happen is probably every DnD fans dream XD love this
The Peeler is best character everyone else is wrong unless it is The Peeler. Edit: just fixed a few spelling mistakes :D
This is a great example of how dnd sessions can never be predicted and I loved the twist of Mark and the neighbor being the same person
..............dragon.
sounds like y'all had some unlucky dice for this :D
Nice! This is another animated game video even if it's not a video game one lol.  I love the use of the dynamite at the end.
When I started playing D&D my mom said "Now you are a true nerd!"  and im glad im not the only one
The story of this campaign was chaotic and amazing, and the whole animated design of it just brought it all together as well!! I love this sm
I love the tracking runes detailing
She is FINALLY back
Who else noticed the Vox Machina team at 1:14 ?
Play yokai watch
I loved this!! if you do any more games I at least would love more content like this!!
You can't tell me that 1:16 isn't a joke cameo of Vex, Grog, Pike and Keyleth from Critical Role's first campaign. That was an unexpected neat detail.
This... Feels... Perfect... This is all what D&D is about.
Do more pleas
Jaiden, James and swoosh upload on the same day!!!
Yooo I also played dnd for the first time yesterday I'm a gnome paladin with a big ass sword and club, babeh >:D
0:13 * le gasp *😮
On the topic of DND I finally got my dice and I am so hyped for my next session
I can't believe Alpharad chose to be Larry from Pokémon 😂
JAIDENS FIRST TIME WAS CLOSE TO MINE ASWELL????? :0
I love how D&D has been getting a lot more love in the last 10 years or so. It’s an amazing game and I love hearing people’s first encounters with it. So happy that you were able to experience it!
Who else feels bad for mark
I love how you drew Alpha as Larry
How you described this adventure is seriously impressive. I try to post recaps of my campaign online and it’s really hard to convey
Fine, I guess I will start a DnD campaign with my idiotic friends
Of course its larry
Paul sounds like Larry from S&V 😂
What's the name of the song at the end
great vid!
You don’t know how much I would wanna watch more of this
Pls more
Tholomule never got out of the time loop, i assumed they would use the wand to end it but it collapsed into dust before doing so as it was 2 time use  ....this means that all of this was basically for nothing, considering a session 2 may happen im curious if that will come into play, as Tholomule will be the only one who remembers this session they may be able to speedrun it and then continue onto something else
I love that Paul is just, disappointed from start to finish, like everything is just another thing to add to the list of misery, and I knew Jaiden would do the point blank breath attack, every dragonborn character is contract bound to do that when they get the chance.
As I dnd  player I approve
next time on D&D with jaiden  the group fights the legendary dragon ari
W Paul
Not even 4 minutes in and this story is 10 times more colorful and hilarious than 2 years of my DnD "experience".
This was awesome
As someone who just had their first dnd section recently, yep 👍
Damn so he tossed the shit out of his kid twice lol
The zelda music is probably the best background music for something like this
THE MASKED DEDEDE MUSIC IN THE CLAY PENGUIN SCENE ! love it 😂
Slimecicle!? Oh yeah boys it's time for the Chuckle Dungeon 3.0!
YEEESSS THIS WAS AMAZING
Adventure time cow...I seent it
"My name is Yoshikage Kir-"
Aagghhhh, the Vox reference, I LOVE THIS VIDEO
When I did dnd we just made characters and then did absolutely nothing afterwards.
9:52 Jake said "what if we kill it?" and theay did it
in 9:54 the horse is from adventure time
the next time y’all play, PLEASE stream it 😭😭
2:23 💀
This was so good!  Was that some Paper Mario music in there?  I was jammin' ^_^
If this video doesnt have Foolish voice acting a dog I'll be pretty sad.
Oh no, a popular non-dnd youtuber made a video about dnd, now a bunch of father less 12 year olds are gonna start getting into the hobby and ruin everything
so... did the cat just repeat the game again after that? how did you guys forget about the cat?!?!?!
16:11 LES GOOOO🔥🔥🔥🔥
This was amazing! Totally do this again. As a huge D&D nerd, I was totally surprised by this! Thank you so much for this.
VERY NICE
Oh my GOD I HAVE PLAYED THIS MODULE BEFORE!
This is amazing and hope you do another one
Only a true legend could get 40k views in an hour.
How many 1s did Jacob roll?????
Yay
Pokemon reference
I love D&D. I’m glad Jaiden is playing.
I recently had MY first game of dnd so this is very realavent xD (also omg Jaden's character I'd a dragonborn like mine xD)
Seems to reading a fanfiction but with animation and fun :D
Mark's wife and kid having mustaches too is so funny.
Not the depression magic  14:08
I love that Jacob's character is designed like a combination of Larry from Scarlet and Violet and Phoenix Wright.
This was awesome, i always wanted for a typical DnD session to be drawn by a talented artist, and am so grateful that this masterpiece extists now.
Two amazing animations in one day just awesome 😎👍
"They run into an invisible force they can't see"
The longer a youtuber exists and the larger their following, the larger and larger the chance becomes that they shall inevitably cross over with other youtubers who cross over with other youtubers who cross over with other yourubers, thereby interconnecting all youtubers with one another, inescapably, meaning that to achieve true global unity of humankind, all human being must become youtubers and play dnd with other youtubers until everyone is intrinsically connected with everyone else on a deep, personal level.
Whoa Vox Machina is looking WILD
I love Dungeons and Dragons. I've only played it once and came in second place (my best friend came in first) I had a ton of fun though.
Ranboo in his natural form: Anxious Cat
Jaiden, do you know what you've done giving yourself a fursona now?
I love the vox mocina plug
Jaiden's character, zoos, kinda reminds me of Susie from Deltarune and that alone is awesome!!!
I've been playing Baldurs Gate 3 so I've been enjoying D&D stuff.
hope to see another one of these soon
Oh I remember this moduel! My friends and I ran this, and my Ex seduced a bear
Where can I play D&D? Is it just a Board Game or does it also have a Online Version/Video Game Version?
1:16  I love that vox machina is there already
It was amazed do this again please
Wait, Jacob just made himself Larry for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet! XD
It’s Jaiden the dragon ranboo the cat and apharad the larry
“DON’T LISTEN TO HIM, HE’S A ZEBRA!” -Riddle door
Cat Bard we love to see!!
Exceptional! Great Animation and sound! Good story and humor.
God job jaiden, you new job is now forever to entertain us with amazing dnd animations
Paul, Paul, Paul... Never forget to make a cougar check when you are in the woods. But yeah, D&D is fun and puzzle dungeons can be very entertaining, the hard thing is to make them just difficult enough. They can easily get too hard or too easy.  Heh, I remember when I drove my players nuts in one. We had 2 experienced players and 2 new ones. This was the second session and second dungeon, they had solved everything so far (or at least survived an oopsie or 2) by carefully taking their time. This time they enters a room with an empty chest in the middle and a mirror on the wall (I already used a mirror trap in the first dungeon. When they study the room they see the chest is filled with treasure but they also see the old evil wizard who built the dungeon long ago. And here is the evil part, I suddenly out of nowhere switch to real time. They see the wizard go to the chest and pick up an item (me providing a picture, it looks expensive) and walks away with it. Everyone is confused and starts chatting but a minute later the wizards shows up again and take something else. The players are getting a bit stressed and starts trying examining things.  When the wizard comes the third time, they panic and break the mirror which sadly destroys all the rest of the treasure. They were pretty mad. :)  There are of course many other fun ways to play D&D, everything from a murder mystery to strategic warfare, romantic comedy or whatever you think is funny but puzzle dungeons have a special place in my heart. As a player you feel incredible smart when you figure out each puzzle, it might be a bit like giving a dog a treat for making a trick, but it is fun.  If you run those, don't have too many "You must solve this puzzle to proceed" though, have more "you get a treasure if you solve this" since it is easy the players get stuck otherwise and that ain't no fun. I use 3D dungeons for these kinds of things myself, but a floorplan or just some drawing works fine too.
I’ve never laughed so hard as I did during this session, and it’s amazing to see it all animated :D
Me encantó ❤
not even 3 minutes in and i already love this video
I want more plz
i love how paul is just larry
I'm only 7 minutes in, and this is making me laugh so much. Must've been such a fun game.
As a Dragon, I can confirm there are dungeons
That was a fun video. As always your content is great. I almost choked at the acid breath bit. Was drinking water and couldn't not laugh. That was hilarious. Even funnier that you broke the DM.
gobblegob rolled 2 nat 1s :skull:
D&D is absolutely amazing and a big part of my life, I'm so glad one of my favorite youtubers and streamers likes it too! Well wishes on your D&D journey :)
If you’d tell me my 2018 fav content creator would collab with my 2021 fav content creator to play my 2023 fav game  I would’ve not believed you until I saw this video
I love the door face so much
I love how Paul is just Larry with blond hair lol
you should add voice acting
in the manga jaidens character had to talk to the devil but they took that outof the anime for time constraints
its wormin time
Part 2 pls
I like when it said "It's Wormin' Time™!" And wormed all over the place
OMG!  I just started playing D&D too!  Our first ever session, we got our butts kicked by basically big bugs for over an hour, lol!  (Stirges for those in the know)
I remember in my first dnd campaign we were at an inn and I thought the room fees were way to expensive (which they weren't) so I slept in the kitchen sink.
The peeler, his great revenge.
bets jaiden video imo, great work jaiden!
First Saiko, then James, then FlygonHG, and now jaiden! My day is getting happier every second! :)
I played D&D for the first time this year after seeing the movie. So yeah its such a magical thing to step into.
Lol alpha is just a blonde Larry
You should try branching into Warhammer 40k
Why does the Horse above the campfire on 9:51 look like the horse from Adventure Time.
I love how Alpharad is just Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet
This was just amazing. I am feeling like I just needed this.
I could watch a million of these
MORE DND VIDS PLEASE THIS IS AMAZING
Worth the wait
Omg finaly you dont imagine how muche i whanted someone to do this
Does who think jaiden is amazing    👇
I hope we get more parts this was amazing
Three Thousandth Six hundred Fifty Second
Oh shit alpha is Larry
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!!!!
I feel like Paul's axe should be called "Buisness Cuts."
Yo I literally screamed when I saw vax machina lmao!!!!
man I want to see more of this
HUH MY FAVE ANIMATOR AND GAMER PLAYING DND TOGETHER
Yoooooo lets gooo
Funny enough I never played dungeons & dragons
Lol the fact that I got the first riddle right and said Zebra
I'm kinda at lost that Jaiden didn't go Aarakokra, Owlin or Kenku, this was a great video, also I this video remind me how Jaiden can be an agent of chaos, the Acid blast
That was so fun to watch oh my god My favorite part had to be when luap just magically shifted to spell paul and i smiled✨
YES! IT GOT AN ANIMATION! OH MY GOD YES!
What was the song when Mark Thompson appeared??
I love how Paul is literally Larry from Scarlet and Violet
Mooooooooore
I play DND at school and my friend made me make my character koryo to pee. He got locked in the bathroom 🙂
The casual Vox Machina cameo
ever thought of playing a fromsoft games? if you are i can help you through it like elden ring or blood borne
That was super fun.  I would love to see the actual session, and I hope you get the chance to play more soon.  Just to add to how unhinged D&D can get, I was part of a one shot last night.  We were fighting a drow that had information on our quest giver's missing brother and were supposed to "bring back alive, preferably" and a dracolich, when our druid asked our dm a simple question.  Has he ever seen a t-rex?  One high/low roll later, the rest of us were polymorphed into t-rexes.  Let's just say there wasn't much left of our enemies.  But it wasn't our fault we killed the guy.  We had an intelligence of 2.  My meek, bookish former space pirate astral elf wizard was reveling in the power.  It.  Was.  Incredible!
this was sick
Wasn't there a part with a familiar going suspiciously evil too?
Finally some jaiden animations
The depiction of Alpharad in the beginning as Larry is great 😂 The whole video was awesome 😀
LOL Alpharad was just Larry
This was awesome!  I can't wait to see the next session. ^^
loved it... make more
I love d&d
End and and and and dnd
4:15  "Woodsman. You must put more oil into the lantern."
NO ONE GONA MENTION THE CASUAL VOX MACHINA REFERENCE?? 1:13
Hi Jaiden! Good vid! (:
I can just tell you guys were laughing throughout the entirety of this
Paul reminds me of Larry from pokemon SV.
PAUL IS SO LARRY CODED I LOVE IT
She did her first subscribe shill I’m so proud
Day 1 of me asking Jaiden to play Pokemon Uranium.
4:15 THE BEAST
Poyo? (Dungeons and Dragons? Have heard of it but haven’t played. It does sound fun though!)
god i wish they livestream a dnd sesh
15:32 great video
Fellow Dragonborn I see
I can't believe Vox Machina fucking exploded
Please Jaiden Make a video on Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga  It also has a secret multiplayer if you play it on the GameCube
I would love to see a sequel at some point! This was amazing. (also Robertidk if you are reacting to this and happen to see this, hi!)
Ok
So cool I love it 😊😊
Holly god, this campaign is so good and fit together is magical
So cool!!
All my favorite people!
MORE
Yes more d&d
T- that was beautiful.. I’m gonna cry :(
I may have popped off at seeing this video, and then even _more_ seeing Taako's Cookbook come flying off the tavern table at 2:52. 💙🌂
I loved this so much cbkeneoekekem
yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
No one going to talk about the Doug doug manager from HIS dnd campaign?
Tbh it was different type of video but i really liked it tbh no matter what type of dnd its always fun to watch
Yeaaaaa baby
I love catboo
The fact that Alpharad is just Larry but at a Walmart is so funny to me.
I f*cking love Ranboo’s character so much, also cool how you can figure out who is who even without explicit details
Soooooo… Ranboo = furry CONFIRMED?????
Is this the war crime story
Why is Paul Larry from Pokémon scarlet/violet? 😂
Its morbin time
Paul was hilarious. Jacob truly understands the intricacies of funny ha ha
I love your vidéos :)
This Is literally the best video i have ever watched
but like i cant understand the door thing
This is nice, makes me want to play using any of my imaginations.
I love how Paul is cosplaying as Larry  from Pokémon Violet and Scarlet.
Dnd Stream?
bro alpharad is litteraly just larry from pokemon what the
Totally worth waiting 2 mouths     C H E E S E
that was awesome i happened to notice that you left out the part when your charater lost there soul forever
Fun fact: Sue is also the name of the most complete T-rex
Jaiden and the team just animate stories with finesse. A DnD session for the ages!
I NEED YOU TOO MAKE A PART 2 OR IM GOING TO  E X P L O D E
Alpharad really had the full larry energy
Les go d n d nerds
I remember this stream! the Mark fight is just pure gold
Within an hour
Oh they gotta do a part 2 XD
3:17 Kuroshitsuji reference ???
Here in under 1 hour
It's WORMIN TIME!!!!
Frist
ok so these are my guesses for their classes i think that  alpharad is a figther because hes character design and rolplay is larry like and larry is the most basic and fighter is basic ramboo is bard because of the music stuff and also he has a sorcorer like spell list with jaden i am not wery sure i thougth at the start she was sorcorer but she used commamand witch makes me thnk that  she is cleric i think it colud be either but i think it is more likley thet she is cleric but it could of been some homebrew ore just some confusion with a new player
4:15 dont think i dont see the beast in the background there
This was so cool honestly
"Ella! Is that you?"  "Oh hi Mark."
oh the final was so awesome ^-^
me and my friend both ace also made dragonborns as our first characters, this cant be a coincidence
I swear Paul looks like a different fictional character every time i see him. First he was Larry Pokemon then he was Nanami then he became Pheonix Wright.
One time when me and my friends were playing dnd (they made the mistake of letting me be the dm) I had them fight a giant bobblehead Donald Trumpy figure. His move set included blaming liberals, throwing fried chicken and bribery.
an animated D&D campaign reminds me so much of early Youtube animations and Jaiden's delivery is just so on point
9:53 is that the adventure time horse?
Two things that really jumped out to me: The idea of the clay turning into monsters is such a cool idea! The fact that everyone is gonna make something different means that the monsters are gonna be different each time. I'm stealing this for my campign.   I would have never thought to use "Depression" as a word for Command. But what funny is that Command only lasts 1 round (6 seconds), so you cna basically give people 6 second bouts of depression. Also, that whole thing of using Disguse Self then acid blasting him in the face is the kind of insane schemes that I LIVE for in D&D!
This was amazing!!!! ❤
Sooooooo gooood!!!!! Ya love to see it. Newbies are always welcome at the table! Obvi cause then you get great stuff like using command to cast depression????!!!! 12/10. No notes
Of course Ranboo chose to be a cat otherwise it wouldn't make sense cause he is a two colored enderman. So a two colored cat
a man in a suit, a cat musician and an dragon born walk into a bar.
Bro I’m going to play next weekend thanks for making this video 😂
Alpharad being Larry is so funny
Here before an hour
Alpharads character is basically Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and violet
I thought you would upload today
That was awesome!
did anyone else notice how alpharads character is essentially larry from pokémon scarlet/violet
that poor bar XD
WOW!
Petition to make this a series
Alpharad’s character pretty much being Larry from Pokémon SV is funny, he wants to be him so bad
Cool that you made a vox machina reference
You should do more anything ubscure board games
dude this was amazing
This was an absolute perfect campaign session with all the wacky fun of DnD! I hope if you play more you make videos on those as well. ^_^
Honey wake up jaiden posted again!
my friend once told me that his party defeated the final boss with a peanut, bc it had an severe allergy
Every time with bards when they use there Chrisma and Seduce an ogre
"and for some reason, they all went along with it."  *dnd in a nutshell*
that was BYFAR the MOST D&D a story could EVER be! THAT....WAS....AMAZING lol
Knowing Bartholomew and Paul were totally wrong about Mark, and they really just bullied him and then blamed him for their problems makes this so much funnier. Like Mark didn’t do anything to them, and then they killed him. Bartholomew is a lil gaslight gatekeep girlboss and I love them.
:3
More
Dude my partys adventures were amazing and really funny we kinda destroyed everything we came across tho lol.
I have played this exact campaign. It was also my first campaign. I love it so much that we have done a continuation of the campaign using other companies that our DM ties the stories together. It's a once a year tradition that we do in December
I watched this live and OH MY GOSH THIS WAS THE FUNNIEST THING IVE EVER SEEN
'DEPPRESSION!!🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥'
0:56 jaiden turned into susie from deltarune 💀💀💀
Holy shit this is amazing pleaseeeeeeeeee do more I don’t have a party to play dnd with this is how I live vicariously well this and baldurs gate
Hey I just started playing, too! 😁
why does jaiden and theodds1out upload at the same day
this is the greatest adventure of dnd i have ever had the pleasure of watching.
The DM and the rest of the party cracking up together... yeah that's how you know it was a good D&D adventure.
Dangong and sarhlng
THIS WAS AWESOME :DDD I can’t wait to turn more people into different bugs
Can you do another one when you play again PLEASE
What happened to the Turtle also named Paul jr?
I only clicked bc i saw ranboo
i've been wanting to play d&d for so long, and this has just made me want to play it even more
Little pike, grog, keyleth, and Vex!
As an old lady, "D&D is a really popular game" is a sentence I never thought I would hear, and I'm genuinely happy it's found a wide audience.
TBH, D&D completely matches Jaiden's style so incredibly much
Better than lacadaisy
I've been wanting to play dnd for a while now it seems so fun. Me and my friends played a dnd like campaign on google slides and it was so fun
Vox Machina reference omg!!!! 1:15
i once had a DnD Game where we were all lvl 2 and figting a Necromance(boss) standing at the top of a flight of stairs, i (a Wizard) casted Fire Bolt with a crit and instantly delt a fourth of the Bosses Health in Damage, after which he fucking cast something to choke me to death from afar (similar to force choke) , and while he is doing that, our ranger runs up to him and kicks him down the stair which not only makes him lose concentration meaing im free again , but he also fails 3 rounds in a row to get the saving throw to stand back up, so we just all get at him while he is lying at the bottom of the stairs until he just dies
I was waiting for the part where she disgusted herself as the wife... i remember the clip of her doing this.. man that was hilarious then, still hilarious now
Why did I think that Jaden was going to be a bird like ari
Where have You been!? We were still worried about you!
Has anyone noticed that Paul looked like Larry from scarlet and violet
This was a brilliant watch
I have the opposite problem of Jaiden where I want to play but I don't know anyone else who's interested
This was amazing
I love that paul looks like a blonde larry
Amazing video omg the best video Jayden has ever made😊
This was so funny I love it!!!
Yeah dnd is always super chaotic for us silly neurodivergents the best way i love it
Jaiden’s avoidance to self promo is so respectable!
paul will be on the tumblr sexyman wiki by the end of the day i know he will
This is like a hecking movie!
Paul reminds me of the villain from the TAZ campaign… also lary
This is an amazing animation, however, once again you have fueled the community with more "ideas" with your new dragon sona lmaooooo
This is the perfect video to introduce my friends to DnD
Jaiden asking to subscribe and felling strange its funny
Whilst listening to the epic story I could work out the Critical Fails (1 on the dice rolls)! :D
Then I hear, that Charlie (CHARLIE!) is a DM, I knew, what it will be PURE CHAOS.
NEW VIDEO LESS GOOOOO 🔥🔥
I AM SOOO HAPPY YOU MADE A VIDEO ABOUT DND. It's getting really popular reasentle this was really exciting
DND! :D
Ah yes the group consists of the ender dragon, black and white cat, and a guy that looks like the guy from pokemon
The biggest agent of chaos as DM. This can only go right.
cmon, alpharad as Larry from pokemon is by far the most fuuny idea for a charachter ive seen. and ive ssen a goblin arms dealer
YAYYYY DND!!!!
Justice for Paul 😢😢
Stellar!!!!!!😂❤
Very swag DnD
this would be a great series to watch
Why’d you do him like that
I NEED MORE DND ANIMATIONS
I literally commented on the vod that Jacob’s character was basically just Larry and now look at his hair
A jaiden and a odds1out video on the same day wow
More More Moreeeeee!!!!!
10:51 If you know who that sheep is from your a real CN fan
JAMES AND JAIDEN POST THE SAME DAY? Well this has to be the best day ever
I love the Vox Machina cameos!
Alpharad is literally larry with blond hair
What a fun looking oneshot idea!
The amount of memes on this video makes me happy
I see Paul only packed the essentials into his adventurer briefcase ... a battleaxe
no way james and jaiden both uploaded on the same day
Thank you for all the Superstar Saga music in this episode. That was a nostalgia trip for me. 😊
recently i played a character called "Mediocretes," a philosopher who is really good at things some of the time. my friend was dm'ing and made the entire party go up against our evil doppelgangers, and while everyone else was fighting, Mediocretes and evil Mediocretes were having a philosophical debate about whether or not water is wet. in the end, we were the last two left standing, and Mediocretes defeated evil Mediocretes in a battle of wits as he suddenly just spontaneously combusts after accepting his loss in the debate. i think the funniest part about that session was the fact that me and the dm were actually debating the entire time whenever it was my turn.
This. Is. AMAZING ❤
I LOVED THIS!! I have always wanted to play but, I’ve never been able to. P.S. We need MORE of this :]
Is Alpha just playing Larry from Pokémon? Of course he’d played someone like that.   Also we need a series of like what DingoDoodles was able to do. DND is awesome
I liked this this was good
THAT WAS GREAT PART 2 PLEASE NOW :D
So was this a one-shot or will the story continue?
VEXAHLIA
Man I love animated dnd stories and your existing style fits perfectly, excellent video all around!
I LOVED THIS VIDEO PLEASE DO MORE!!!
I guess us ace’s just love Dragonborn’s
Do more
Great video🎉 in my dnd campaign I was a cocky pretentious orc named Gor Maund who chose ordain himself in just a loincloth, some boots, and gauntlets decked in jewelry but whose primary weapons where an enchanted fork and knife of fire and ice. A background in enchantment and alchemy/ poisons as that gives great flavor to their opponents. Cursed to chase the greatest culinary treasures the world had to offer forbidden or otherwise.
I LOVE the characters, they all look so cool (especially Tholemew).
JAIDEN AND RANBOO?
Two of my favorite animators upload in one day!? This is Beuty
I like how DND is legitimately just imagining having fun. 😅  ( sidenote for the record I really do like DND. I think it’s really fun )
I never knew I needed this until I saw it
Man talking remind me of kira from Jojo explaining his life
Wait, didnt you seduce someone and then proceded to break his heart in some kind of dnd game or was that just a Jaiden Animations Mandela Effect?
jaiden is safe. she still hasn't been in a car accident
honestly i really wanna play this game
I remember seeing an animation for that disguise as Mark’s wife scene from like 8 months ago and thought it was hilarious. Glad to finally see the full adventure with context.
Is there a possible D&D stream on the way?
Now we need a video of Cosmo's kitchen session
Ok but charlie and ranboo in jaiden’s style it’s one of the best things i saw today specially ran’s cat version ‼️
I love how jacob is larry lmao
Jayden was a black gator-looking dragonborn? I see she and i are alike in tastes. Mine was named sobek and i was framed for murder multiple times that we had to paint me rainbow colors to hide in plain sight. No one expects an alleged murderer to galavant so consicuously.
Real😊
DnD has become so much more than just a game for nerds, and I'm terrified to play it still but I'm glad it's become so fun ^^
I knew it would be chaotic the moment it was revealed Charlie Slimecicle was given the power of god.
In my school there’s a club (not D&D, a game called Warhammer 40k kill team) and the people in it nicknamed it hellfire club
This was so incredibly fun to watch, made me realize how much I've missed DnD with my squad as our last session was in like January TwT
14:19 pull out a gun and shot himself
Jaiden is like the perfect in-between a gamer and a animator
RAMBD9DOEO
GREAT VID WOW
Poor gobble gob he rolled I'm presuming 2 Nat 1s throwing himself of a cliff twice
So much fun! Hope that you get to play again sometime.
ha ha first hour. bow before me foolish mortals.
Man I wish I knew how to play DnD- And I wish I had someone to play with
I LOVE the Vox Machina reference in the Oak Inn
This was so fun watching live, and this is so well-made I'm having the best time watching! NICELY DONE with the wink wink Critical role Cameo!
Do I wanna play D&D? Yes. Do I know a spot where I can join a campaign? Kinda. Do I have the place (Discord)? Nope.
0:37  all ready did 😊
u shoud play warhamer it is like  d n d but better
I can’t believe alpha’s character is god damn Larry
this was so fun to watch!
So Larry from pokemon, a dragon and a cat go commit war crimes. Cool.
I'm trying to figure out what class Zoot was...
jaiden having cursed  speech and screaming DEPRESSION is crazy
That was absolutely awesome!
i just fucking realized alpharad's character is just larry.
This is like the door moment in Vox Machina but extended
the fact that this video came out when i was playing d&d with my friends is funny
NEW JAIDEN YEAHHHHHHHH
This was… this was a very controversial video. It’s leaving me speechless right now this is all of the plot twists were crazy and like just not what you expect from a normal game they’re just like it’s like an experience that is like changes and never ending changing experience that never ends up in the same way. —Sophie
As a DnD player! We welcome you with open arms!
Click here to claim your 'I was here within the hour of upload' ticket!
why is paul just larry from pokemon scarlet and violet also, this vid is the best
PLS HEART THIS COMMENT JAIDEN
I am eating liquid shit
Love the vox machina cameo at the start
I LOVE DnD!!!!!!!!!!!! Ive been Dming for years, and watching jaiden for longer! so glade theres another Jainden vid, love slimecicles content too, CORN!!!!!!!! and the ZELDA MUIC?????????!!!!!!!!!!! this is a great video, good job jaiden and team! I am now a member on twitch and YT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I enjoyyy itt!!!! I love it!!!!!!
This was absolutely fantastic! I loved it
Tell me please if anyone sees this Paul looks like Larry from pokemon
Cool
The Critical Role reference at 1:15 was so cute 🥳
I love animated dnd session
D&D is an incredible game! So glad you made a video about it.  My profile picture is of my first actual D&D character, a lizardfolk sorcerer named Kothar who made planning a session a nightmare for my DM do to the usefulness of dimension door.
Jadin did you met a strange man in August
It's better for you not to know what my friends do with sheep when I was DM...
Ye Old Mart of Wall!! XD I is dead
I absolutely loved everypart of this
One time I rolled a nat 20 on AND I QUOTE "killing the ocean" so the dm had my character throw a weak punch and then the ocean just vanished. While we were falling on our boat my friend rolled a nat 20 on REINSTATING the ocean. That was the most chaotic session ever.
Okay I’m only a few minutes in but I just need to say OMG IT LOOKS SO GOOD, LIKE ITS LITERALLY A MINI TV EPISODE, JAIDEN THIS IS SERIOUSLY INCREDIBLE🤩  I can hardly believe how far this channel has come, thank you for such an amazing time!🎉
Yeah that checks out as a dnd session lmao
That was such a chaotic experience... AND I LOVED IT!!! Jaiden, maybe next game you could equip your character with an enchanted mandolin that you use as a war hammer!
😃👍
this was so unhinged and i love it
hey this animation is very cool but theres a very loud high pitched  buzzing sound in the background of a good bit of the video, probably a bug or something
Man what a party ranboo, alpharad, and jaiden with slimecicle as the dm
"Ye Olde Mart of Wal."  WELP, the game already went off the deep end.
This was so great 😂😂😂
Well, damn, now I HAVE to get into DnD. I'm still deciding my species and class, and I don't have a party yet, but when I get there, I'm sure it'll be a blast!
YES, OMG I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT!
*"DEPRESSION!"*
you captured ranboos nervous stutter as tholomew so perfectly lol this is amazing !! i hope you guys can play dnd together again soon :D
D&D is life, it's the only reason I'm still around  🙃
Hi
YIPPEEEEE
The fact the asexual is the dragon is so fitting
I love that alpharad just looks like Larry from pokemon sv
Nothing is better than DnD stories. This was awesome
This came out during my dnd session
I love how Paul looks like a combination of Jacob and Larry
The ending is the clip everyone has seen 😂😂😂
NO WHY DID JAIDENS CHARACTER JUST YELL DEPRESSION AND MADE MARK DEPRESSED BUT LMFAO ITS FUNNY ;-;
Nice 1hour
i love new players
What are the classes for the characters
1:42 Larry is that you? How did you get out of Paldea? And since when you are blond?
Please please I need a part 2 of this
Last year I started a D&D campain my sister started a campain to become meyor and we were talking with are party what are campain name wolud be but my sister said to us SHH NOT YET but the woman at the desk thout that was are campain name also my sister tamed an owlbear named alfred. PS my sister Maria Loves your videos Jaiden she has bean whaching since the begging of your channel :)
Amazing! Can't wait to see you become the next Dingo Doodles :D
Paul has big Larry energy (my opinion on this was absolutely not influenced by how Jaiden drew Paul, I have no idea what you mean)
I love how this video was done!
I see critical role and I immediately like
I think D&D would be too complicated for me,will I understand any of the rules or understand the dice thingy? probally not,my 1% brain cell hates paying attention,but I've always heard D&D is similar to roleplaying,so that does make me feel more comfortable and relaxed
I just joined my schools d&d club and set up a character with my friends my character is a bard ( yes i put all my points into crisma) and my friend is a holy night (i forgot the proper name) and the hole secion is just pure screaming and horrible dice rolls but it was fun to try would recommended to any to play
Slimecicle + Ranboo. New faces on the channel. So cool.
You should talk with cellbit
This is the funniest D&d campaign ever
Great video
very cool
HOLY MOTHER OF FUCK THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE MY FAVORITE CREATORS OF ALL TIME DOING A DND COLLAB?! AND RANBOO IS A CATBOY?! HOLY SHIT
I freaking love this video. Someone should make an anime series out of this
I love how throwing ink at the spot where invisible Mark just disappeared from failed, but tackling the air worked
if the villain is a walmart chief, i guess this is in the same universe as Doug Doug DnD then
In the first 5 mins you guys already bombed the whole tavern??
Oh honey, jaiden animations just posted, get the snacks
Watching the stream felt like a fever dream...   I LOVED IT!
1:15 nice reference to Vox Machina
Pokemon DnD exist btw Jaiden
I played D&D with my friend (I have never played it) so he shoots a bad guy in the hand disarming him then he shoots him in the leg now the guy is on the ground and my friend above him with his gun pointing at the guy so my friend roles he gets a bad roll so he shoots the guy and the other hand
Your animation has Improved so much since I started watching your vids , I’m impressed. ❤❤❤
ofc alpharad would pick that normal type gym leader for scarlet and violet
IM EARLY TO A JAIDEN VIDEO YEEEEEE BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII FINALLY
I hope that Jaiden continues to play DnD, and that we get more videos like this one. I could not possibly have enjoyed it more. 😂
YAAAAY!!!!!
I'm reporting this to the government because in my head Jaiden and Ronald Booth are in two different universes. This is illegal and I will get to the bottom of this.
Very Cool! Great Video!
1:15 Is that Vox Machina!?   Based.
I love this video so much
Dang all my yt channels that I watch is posting today.
I'd just like to know what "it's worming time" suggests...
Well, i mean, all considered this was the least chaotic First session i have ever personally seen
mt first time playing dnd was like 3 weeks ago its so fun!!! we prob did it at the same time!
This was so amazing!!! I loved having you back, and I think this might be my new favorite video of yours! Keep u[p the amazing work!!!
Was this dnd game an acid trip?? Not judging just asking.
The VM members in the Jaiden Style all look cute asf.
ADVENTURE TIME REFERENCE        IN 9:54.
I LOVED IT!!
omg i love D&D so so much
Once Charlie was mentioned, I realised what D&D game this was. ACID BLAST. ACID BLAST.
Alpharad just being Larry from Pokémon is the funniest shit ever
I need to watch this VOD
Hello Jaiden, When are you gonna play VGC again
This is amazing😊
17:11 is this foreshadowing another dnd video?
OMG YES GIRL YOU'LL LOVE IT SM ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT IT'S AN ARTIST'S DREAM (an maybe an autistic's dream tsince i am one)
Ok now im convinced animators discuss their posting dates,like even James posted today😅  And also ive never played D&D looks fun!✨❤️
depression XD gawd darn it, i need to remember that
I THINK YOUR STALKING ME! For the past couple of days I’ve been obsessed with trying to find the perfect character for the new school D&D club my friend signed me up for! It starts on October 24th, and it’s going to be SO COOL! Ty for this video, Jaiden! <3
3.2k not first but close also first 50 minutes
I loved every bit of this video😁
One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us!
D&D is literally the funniest game that people won’t give a chance
Im taking this as my sign to start another BG3 campaign immediately
I've always wanted to play D&D, but I just can't seem to find a party to play with.
YEEEEEEEEESSS
I thought I knew what was coming, having DMed a version of the wild sheep chase myself, but this was wild
no f way
Jaiden: *pretends to be marks ex-wife*  Also Jaiden: *Kills mark with acid still dressed as his ex-wife*
Ahhh I remember watching this session and loving it so much!! So happy to see it as an animation I'm so excited :D
all of this goblin bloodshed, thrown animals, and manager execution, for a worm setup. I love it, even if it was a worm.
not the adventure time horse
THE FUCKING WORM JOKE FROM THE PODCAST HOLY SHIT
Hello I’m just here
Point blank acid spray was so funny
15:15 nah you gave Mark Depression and then  also did a FMA brotherhood Envy on him. As far as i know that has to be a war crime.
The moment I heard depression and disguised as marks wife..... I KNEW WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN
As someone in the middle of their first DND playthrough, this was hilarious and awesome
OMG DUDE THIS IS SOOOOOOO AWESOME I WOULD LOVE TO SEE S PART TWO
1:16 Vox Machina refence
Wild how DnD has become so popular, love it
ALPHARAD IS LARRY THIS IS BRILLIANT
I cast my signature spell eternal glacial prayer (giant glacier like spike consumers mark and slightly cracks the roof)
I play dnd. One time I got down bad with a dragon.
What about looped in a day curse?
Paul reminds me of Larry from Pokémon S/V  I must say though, the animation makes the story much easier to follow than watching it live
Yo the timing on this. My family is gonna be playing D&D today.
This looks like it was a fantastic one off. 😁👍
If you end up doing more sessions, please make more videos like this. This was comedy gold!
Why does a farad look like party from pokemon scarlet and violet
Oh cool another person to be jealous of. I've wanted to play a campaign to its conclusion for years and never got a chance
this was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
8:58 slime #### Minds break?
Holy crap jaiden ranboo
me after waiting for this animation:💀
im trying to start a d&d club at my school
will ever make a new pokemon video?
I have been wanting a video like this for very long, thank you Jaiden, for always being an amazing and my personal favorite content creator.
who else saw vox machina
one time I tried to flirt with the mother of all evil dragons and got very much rejected.
15:28I fell out of my bed laughing out loud and crying to much This was funny as Hell😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Also the video was amazing! more vidoes like this!
YEAH DRAGONBORN JAIDEN!
I KNOW THIS ONESHOT I RUN IT FOR MY GROUP LAST WEEK WHAT THE HELL
That's such a great story!
Finally Jaiden upload again OMGGG
We need more of this.
I think jaiden should play as dungeon master and ari as the final boss
YES! I’VE ALWAYS WANTED JAIDEN TO MAKE THIS TYPE OF VIDEO!!!!
Loved it ❤
This is something that i would came up in a dream.
Catboo is finally a reality
Yepn
1:15 ... I'm not even surprise. It's a DnD video, It's to be expected there was going to be a reference to them.
i love imagination
Ice king horse costume
YOOOOO I LOVE DND
7:58 I know this is quite a stretch, but the crown sculpted has ‘T’ on it.   What if it stands from ‘Technoblade’?
Jacob really decided to play Larry
Hey, can we have the rest of the campaign when it happens please?
One time when me and my friend were playing D&D we broke the Geneva Conventions and burnt down a entire village ... then my friend killed me. Good times
9:52 NOOO ICE KING IN DISGUISE IS DED!
The real-life reaction of the members really sold it, that was hilarious!
What class was Jaden praying
D&D was a game that I was holding out on but after I saw this I knew it's good
The whole video encapsulates the D&d experience, especially hiw unhinged everyone is
Love the Critical Role cameo lol
Please do more D&D videos that was so cool maybe do a movie on it but animated
First time I’m early, dang
Love it 😂❤
I love this 💀💀
I am emotional   /pos
This was a wonderful upload to see after starting my first campaign
Make more that was awesome
Nice i never d&d but nice vid
"Sorry never done that before! That sounds weird!!!' While other youtubers "HEY EVERYONE WELCOME TO THE CHANNEL! MAKE SURE YOU LIKE THE VIDEO- SUBSCRIBE- AND HIT THAT BELL ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN!!!!"
So uhhh is it just me or is jacob's character just larry?
was this a one shot?
Hiiiiiiiii jaiden!!!!
OMG I LOVE THAT GAME, I CANT BELIEVE YOU PLAYED ITTTT!
Wait that acid blast in the face sounds familiar. Didn't Jaiden talked about this before in past videos?
Yay I’m early!
Let's be honest, we all wish our own dnd sessions could've come to life in an animation like this too. Amazing video as usual
Is it just me or does Paul look like nanami from jjk?
More animated dnd
Bong water😂😂😂😂😂 should of totally named it that hilarious
JOIN THE CULT
Alpharad definitly has some... inspiration... with that design.
Pls do a pt2 pt3 a pt4  a pt5 a pt6 and many more parts to this I really like this video I think this might be your best video ever
See me personally I really want to get into DnD because I've only ever played slightly once. Problem is my one time playing I immediately ate some food. Got high and incompastitated and then couldnt play for the rest of the session. I still think Id love it I just havent had the chance to play with many ppl.     I should clarify I got high and incompasitated in the game.
I love the horse from Adventure Time on spitroast at 9:52!
Way too funny lmao
LARRY???
15:28 **FATALITY**  **JAIDEN WINS**
Their DND characters are so cute 😮
Sounds like you guys had fun
He esperado este vídeo mucho mucho muuuuuucho tieeeeempo!!!!!✨✨✨✨✨✨ Soy soy taaaan feliz!!!!!
Jaiden never fails to entertain us❤
This was AMAZING
This was definitely a different type of video but I loved it and I hope to see more in the future :)
The crit Role  easter eggs in the background❤
we do be loving d&d. my half elf bard, named alear, recently just got their arm cut off and he now has a gauntlet that has a shotgun in it.
Wait is that the adventure time horse? XD
No I CACKLED when Paul's peeled axe just boomeranged in the air and smacked him in the head. Absolute pure gold.
I-...is Alpha just playing Larry from Pokemon
Paul / Alpharead looks kinda 🔥♨️
Just screaming “DEPRESSION” is the funniest thing I love this so much. DND feels PERFECT for the channel combining those old story time vids because and the newer gaming vids in a way. I really like this. I kinda hope you guys do another one some day in the far future
Please, add subtitles. Some of the lines are hard to understand. Also, the second riddle is AWESOME!
I mean, I got my arm cut off last session
I see Jaiden, I click.
...
As a person who had played DND before, all I ever did was jump into holes for treasures haha
9:51 love the reference to bravest warriors with the way you drew the horse
No way Jaiden and theodd1out uploaded on the same day
lots of fun
HIII I MISS YOU SOO MUCH
This video was almost as good as dog days, you're really stepping up your game
Paul best character
Alpharad looks like Larry from Pokemon scarlet and violet
Ah yes alpharad = Larry with an axe
WHY DID YOU MAKE PAUL SO DANG FINE FOR !???????
This video came out 2 minutes after I got out of my DND session. Coincidence, I think not!
1:40 My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
Dude, im a dragon born too!
This was halarious!
Thank you for this amazing animation, Jaiden and the team=3. I had a great time=)
"IT'S WORMING TIME!!!!!!"
we need more videos like this it was so good
This hands down has to be the best video you’ve ever created
Yay! A new video! It's been a while! :)
Your back ❤
This is so cool!
Thoughts throughout the video  Jaiden did the call to action!! What world is this?!?! 😂  VOX MACHINA!!! YEEEES  So Ranboo’s cat is in a time loop for three years…and this was his first time trying to talk to Jacob and Jaiden’s characters? 😂  How does Speak with Animals blow up a tavern?!?!  The worm sentence hint is so clever. I’m curious how the “turtle/worm” thing happened actually during the game cause I can only guess how chaotic that was  Wait, a clay thing where the players make their own monsters is genius!!! 0__0  Goblin names make sense 😂  HOW MANY NAT 1S DID THIS POOR DIVING GOBLIN GET?!?!  Oooooh okay the time loop thing makes more sense. Dumb gossip cat  WAIT THE FINAL FIGHT WAS WHERE JAIDEN WENT APESHIT WITH THE WIFE DISGUISE AND ACID VOMIT?!?! 😂😂  OOOOOOOOOH MY GOD THAT TWIST AT THE END!! ITS SO SIMPLE BUT I LOVE IT!!!  That had to have been such a fun game. Four chaos gremlins all together. Amazing video Jaiden!!
great video
What’s ranboo doing in my thumbnail. Love him
Had a similar experience where my party was dealing with a pack of giant bat-kangaroo monster and my Dragonborn was going toe to toe with one of em and somehow got to the point where they locked hands with each other, it feels as if a romantic song would play in the background, and as my Dragonborn grasp got even tighter, he blast the bat-kangaroo with a point blank fire breath.
*seduces shrek*
I've watched the session SOOOOO many times and I was very much waiting for this!!! Amazing work as always!! :D
You know that it’s gonna be a good day when Jaiden and the odd1sout post a video
its nice having a new jaiden video and Happy birthday Jaiden
Say hi, Intrepid heroes
love the video and mark saying "would you still let me be your manager if i was a worm?"
Hello Persons
Ofcourse Alpharad, wanted to roleplay as the gym leader from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, As a forever DM, I love this party so much
I don't why but this party gives me heavy deltarune vibes
YEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS JAIDEN PLAY D&D :DDDDDDD
Noice. Also, IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME?!?!?!?!
This is why I love D&D. Moments of chaos and amazing moments like this! What a fun watch!
I like how Alpharad's character is basically Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet 😂
I love how quickly things got wild
I just noticed the vox machina reference
MOREMORE, is the only thing my brain is thinking after watching the utterly amazing session that broke me into laughter every 5 seconds, please Jaiden make time for the other sessions so we could watch them!
Finally a new video
5:26 i had the exact same answer as paul LMAO
OML MY 3 AVE PEOPLE MADE A VID TOGETHER(you, Ranboo ans Slimecicle)
Only true Jaiden Animations fans can like this comment
The fact that Alpha was just plain Larry was soo fun lol
This was a very good video. I want to see more. If been laughing my ass of here. GG =)
14:45 IVE SEEN THIS SCENE OMFG
nice adventure time horse
Legit the use of Dedede's theme slapped in this video.  Also lol Paul's boss and Tholomew's neighbor are the same person
I can't believe Alpharad made Larry. /j
GASPED WHEN I SAW THIS-
I've been wanting to play Dungeons and Dragons for a few years now. But none of my friends are interested. Luckily, I started a new job and one of the managers there is a DND player. So I'm gonna be asking her if I can join her.
I actually almost cried at the end of the story, LUAP!!! PAUL JR.!!!
Si this sponsord by walmard
I would like to play a Dungeons and Dragons game which I get to play as the Master Chief.
I really liked the video you should make more like this, at least I would like it.🙂
I love how the music sinks up with the tone of each seen. When coconut mall kicked in I died😂
Wow, I found this directly after randomly watching a different video about DnD
i’ve never caught a jaiden animations video this early ngl. also YAAAY DND!!!
This is no joke one of my new favorite videos on Youtube and I‘ve been here a long time 😂 Thank you for this ❤ Please a sequel?
WOOOOO
This was AMAZING
Time to see more torture when you guys play games how fun
I wish I had friends that were interested in DND, I’d love to play my first game.
Plz do more!! Ive loved it!
Ahhhh 12:35 that is Pokemon Ranger music!!!!
This was badass! If you end up doing more campaigns I would love to see more videos like this.
I`m amazed jaiden helped so much i have always wanted to play Dungeons and dragons but i am too shy for it,Thank you jaiden this inspires me 15:25 i lost it here  Bro made his son eat Clay And tossed him to a wall💀
I’ve been waiting for the Depression-Disguise Self-Acid Blast combo
It came out earlier than expected 😅
We need a long term campaign of this crew
Please please please PLEASE tell me there's a liveplay recording of this that you or Alpharad will be releasing.
Aint no way Jaiden made Alpharad look like Larry. I love it.
13:15 does anyone know the background music that plays here?  EDIT: to anyone looking, it's the cargo ship hideout theme from pokemon ranger: shadows of almia
Ive been wanting to be a part of a dnd campaign but my schedule is insane
Getting Charlie to host this was the best option you guys could have picked Edit: Also Jacob as, basically Larry, is amazing
Jaiden is such a Munchkin
8:01 YO GUYS IT'S TCNICK3
I LITERALLY FUCKING SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS NOTIF MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS PLAYING MY FAVORITE SILLY GAME IM GOING TO PASS A W A Y
1:24   DOVAHKIIN!!
Paul jr is a real one 😌😌
The chulk
Absolutely beautiful 😭
Jaiden its been a while since you did a video about Ari and it was 4 years ago since the last Ari birthday video you need to pay us Jaden we want anothe video about Ari.
i love this naritive persective.
That was so cool thank you for putting it into a Animated form. I always like your animations. I wanna play this game but it’s just that my family think it’s stuff about the devil that’s not gonna happen anytime soon.😅
Honestly D&D is a lot of fun if you get with the right group, and this D&D group is absolute perfection. Hope you keep having fun playing it!
=)
More dnd stuff please!!
Beans
FINALLY A JAIDEN UPLOAD
as a first time dm, slime is an inspiration
i remember a similar experience with my party where i had no idea what was going on and made up random things to try to keep my party back and they came up with the most insane and stupid ideas. i love being a dm
Hahaha, my first game was a dragonborn that also picked up a a Turtle, though I was looking for a rock to throw and distract so Gobbos. I named mine Frederick.
10 out of fu-- 10 for this video, I want more NOW.
Hey a jaiden vid on my birthday very nice!!!
14:08 Nine months and it finally came out! I thought that take would never come!
Blasting a depressed dude in the face with acid is such a Jaiden thing of Jaiden to do.
Vex and Keyleth?? What are you doing here
gamer
Jaiden
When you hear Kirby Boss Music especially Dedede's Theme then you know things about get really hard
Yeah, a pretty standard session. Muah
When Jaiden mentioned the disguise self part, i went like "oh...OH! I HAVE TO SEE HOW SHE INTERPRETED THIS PART!" It was WORTH IT! (It's at 14:43 if anyone to see it but i recommend watching the full video first, it's amazing.)
Also Paul is inspired by the normal gym leader in Paldea
My first DyD session was as a DM, and boy it made me love DyD. Basically the party's journey were hired byba wealthy family to solve a murder in their mansion. It turned out the little girl was a warforged controlled by goblins in the mansion's basement so they could get all the money but they didn't expect that the whole family were INSIDE the mansion so they were trapped.  God, I LOVE being DM, but sadly I do not have people to play DyD with anymore.
1:49 and 4:35 hey that’s my name. Guess I’m a turtle now. 16:42 I WAS WITH THEM THE WHOLE TIME?!?
DnD is more like a analog video game, and the DM is the analog game engine
Oh my god this is freaking INCREDIBLE! D&D CAMPAIGNS ANIMATED ARE THE PEAK OF EBTARTAINMENT!
I feel like every day Jaidens animation becomes more and more advanced.
I have never thought this day would come when Jordan played dnd
LARRY!
Here's a fun DnD story for those who want it I was playing it at summer camp with my Boy Scout friends.We all had our roles (unimportant however) and we were trying to get rid of a goblin infestation, our dungeon master said we found a goblin king,and said it looked like the one from the Hobbit. We didn't have many figures with us,so we used the best thing we had,a Bowser chess piece from a 15 set of Mario chess. We came up with a name until one guy came up with the best words I have ever heard... "Hobga Gobga" We all agreed it was best and used our weapons to take him down.I got the first hit of damage (which took down most of his health) with my magic javelin it glowed and returned to my hand (like loyalty on a trident in Mincraft) as I hit him in the eye.After we had defeated him he dropped a mystical artofact,his crown. They all said that I should be the one to carry it,and it gave me the ability to summon his ghost to assist us in battle once in a fortnight. And that was how I became Cornelius Featherbottom,The Hobga Gobga Slayer   P.S Yes the name is dumb,it was my first time Playing.
we need mORE
OK YOU KNOW WHAT FORGET WHAT I SAID IM ENTERTAINED😱😍🎊🎆
I like how no one is mentioning the fact that Vox Machina was drinking at the tavern.
How fun! I wouldnt mind seeing more dnd videos from you
Alpharad aka Paul was the mvp most off the time
The plot twists in this video go crazy
Brewstew video yesterday and Jaiden and James video today. I couldn’t ask for anything better!
Am I the only one who saw Grog, Pike, Kelith and Vax'alia from Vox Machina in the Inn
OMG YOU FINALLY MET RANBOO YESSSS!!!
Jaiden feeling embarassed after asking us to subscribe because she's never done that before is actually very funny and cute
Only Jaiden can make a Wal-mart manager severely depressed, making him grieve about his wife and son, pretends to be said wife, deliver comfort to the manager.   and then POINT BLANK FIRES AN ACID BREATH ONTO HIM
Yes dnd content!
Jaiden uploading makes me happy :D
Ohhhhhh I’m SAT muvva
I really can't believe you hadn't played dnd before this, though i am super happy that you loved it❤
Ah I remember being there live BRIEFLY and having a good time. Regardless of how youbfelt about it afterwards, were glad you gave it a try and brought some content out of it!
Also cheese
I love the Legend of Vox Machina reference early on
Jayden fans always come early
I've been playing D&D for a little over a year now, it's fun
best video yet. (i think)
I enjoyed the Vox Machina reference. 😄
we got to see the mark acid blast animated oh my god.
So great!!! Ive been waiting for this video since I saw the subathon!! :D
I love this sm
1 hour gang 👇
FIRE
babe wake up new jaiden animation
I WANT TO PLAY D&D !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My new favorite jaiden animations video. Great job to making it and great job to Charlie for dming that chaos!!
42 mins ago?!?
I just started playing dnd as well
I really want to see the actual session, or even the highlights would be great this was one of the best dnd vids i’ve ever seen with amazing party members and dm!
What about the turt
what a pleasant surprise. i love diddles and dangles
Ranboo making himself a crown is nice
PT 2  PLSSS
Ranboo WOULD make a character that's in a groundhog day style time loop.
I really hope this is the start of something
The depression spell is so accurate 💀💀💀
Complete 180 with that acid breath. Poor Mark ):.
HELLO
Jaiden has become nerd. There is no escape
so uh Paul threw his own child  twice and we're going to let that slide?
Here's a lesson for all new DND Players: Do. Not. Make. Edgy. Characters. I made this mistake and I regret it dearly. They are not fun, uncool, and can even ruin the game for others.
Dam Jaiden and James uploading at the same day is cool
This was so incredibly entertaining (point blank acid blast betrayal we really funny and something I would totally do)  I just wonder what class everyone played. I know Ranboo was a bard and Jacob could have been a barbarian (???) but I don't know for sure.
Wait i kinda want to play d&d now
I love how you could just tell when someone rolled a 1 and the fact that Alpharad's character is literally just Larry from Pokemon but with an axe
I was waiting for this video to come out for about a month or two. THIS IS AMAZING MY GOOOD
2:01 “I’m sorry sir….but this is a Wendy’s”
please make this a series
I really hope Jaiden gets a chance to be on JRWI (Charlie’s DND podcast), judging by his chaotic she is here this would be such a treat!!
If i ever played d&d i would just want to cause as much chaos as possible
This kind of feels like the legendary nuzlocke vids. Great timing too, I'll be playing DND for the first time in a decade next month. Halfling Pallading, because yes this is an self-rightious hobbit.
This was amazing would love to see more
Wholesome
Of course Vox Machina
I liked when the worm said “ its wormin time” and wormed all over the place
Watching this one shot made me get into dnd!
I feel like alpharad got inspiration from larry from PSV to create such character
i ask for more dnd weekly
Yoo new video! I love your content Jaiden!
Of course jaiden is an amethyst dragonborn...
I like blankets
1. Wow this video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome 2. VOX MACHINA REFERENCE
I kinda did something similar to the Jaiden acid thing, one of the people we were told to assonate was blind, and my characters voice sounded just like their brothers, so I had a fake conversation with him and then stabbed him in the gut Fucked up I know but my friends thought the conversation was funny
Paul had such Gym Leader Larry energy.   And just so you have at least one person notice, I saw THE BEAST! He stalks like the night, he sings like the four winds, he is the death of hope!
I love this channel
4:15 the beast from “Over the Garden Wall” 4:33 all of the names for Greg’s frog in “Over the Garden Wall” Tell me if I missed any references
Luckily i speak goblin
Also there should be a session 2 soon plz
Do more dnd
people who were here before 1 hour mark  👇
Love the Keyleth, Vex, Grog and Pike cameo at the old oak inn
Jaiden more like dragon (I know I’m not funny)
JORTNADO
Paul being Literally Just Larry Pokémon is killing me
I’d love to see Jaiden on a dnd show like Dimension 20 or similar. Her vibe is perf for it.
We need more episodes!
Is it just me, or did Jaiden make Paul a perfect representation of Larry from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet?
I can't get over this. This is fully colored with fantastic animation, the music is perfect, and the comedy mixed with the absolute badassery of this session is insane. I'm never getting over that acid blast.
Im actully about to go do dnd with my friends what great timing!
DOUBLE OR NOTHINGGG 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Loved the nod to Vox Machina
early
A weekend and Jaiden makes everyone’s day great! :D
oooooooooooooh my lordy
Ye Olde Mart of Wal…sold! 😂
Slimcicle and Ranboo looks interesting in your art style and your very you good at discriptive narration    If you agree And dear god   why does paul look like a Dilf also He looks like the normal gym leader in Paldea 👇
love the larry alpharad XD
I've been playing DND for a while now and this is always my favorite aspect of it, the pure, unbridled off the cuff randomness and chaos that ensues 😊 it's almost more powerful than the magic of friendship ✨
Love it 😂 Can’t wait to play tmmro 😂
That was awesome
You somehow explained the sessions that me and my friends do in the first ten seconds of your video and I find that hilarious. Edit: I also find it hilarious that we both chose to be dragonborns
Why am I not surprised that Ranboo is a cat.
NEW VIDEO!!!1
I forgot about the clip I saw from this session way back when, but as soon as the Disguise Self came into play, it all came flooding back.
I saw the original Disguise-Self-into-Acid-Blast scene, and it was GLORIOUS. That session was in the middle of her Subathon, and she'd already debuted her new model. Everyone was understandably laughing it out when it happened. She put on the heart eyes too. A rare sight.
Are we just going to ignore the fact that Alpha’s character is Larry from Pokémon S/V??
This was the most normal dnd I ever saw. And still perfect
Yay I was excited for this vid!
🐲🕴️🐱🐑🐢
15:26. I would literally have done the same thing, no lie.
alpharad is literally larry fr
Hahaha I love how in the beginning you gave Critical Role a Cameo 😂
welcome to the world of wierdness
DnD’s always been one of favorite things to listen to when doing work😂
Jaiden chooses half dragon.  She just like me!
I laughed a little too hard at the depression bit-
Fools gold vibes
here before an hour passed!
here before an hour passed!
Vox Machina casually chilling in the tavern in great, love the references!
i love the alphalarry
4:21 this reminds me of a campaign I was in with my brother who had a pet rock that ended up somehow becoming sentient and insanely buff so that it could save us all from a banshee. I think the DM saw how easily we were all going to die and decided to take mercy on us (which is kind of the opposite of what he was supposed to do...)
This was so dramatic lol
I love dungeon and dragons its game where you use your imagenation
i do agree, dragonborn is the best >:) been playing baldurs gate 3
I love that Paul looks like Larry from Scarlet And Violet
I Love Paul even tho he Dosen.t really Show Like any personality hes sooo expressive
I’ve run this one shot for my group!… or least a version of this. The talking sheep was a dead giveaway lol!
this is awesome
Is it possible to be a robot or a cyborg in D&D?
Jaiden doing a shameless plug was pretty funny
I remember watching this on stream
Wow!
Man, I love this! If you ever end up making a sequel, it could be fun to see glimpses of the actual game in the middle of the animation kinda like in your nuzlocke videos
Oh my gosh. The algorithm got something to me on time for once1!!1!  Also, try magic the gathering (commander), too
the ending is the best
THIS VIDEO IS SOO GOOD! I love how Jaiden's changing the game for what it means to be an animation channel on youtube these days.
We need a podcast of this whole adventure
Still mad that she doesn’t put the specific music used in description cos It drives me mad not knowing familiar songs
fucking loved this i would so want to hear more of your dnd adventures!!
Jaiden: he was Mark Thompson. Me, a Pokémon fan: ha ha
jaiden is so funny and amazing i love watching her vids omgg
I love that Alpharad is basically Larry in DnD style
1:39 My name is Yoshikage Kira, I'm 33 years old
º19º19º19º19º19º19º19
Jacob’s Larry-sona is peak comedy
Amazing 😍 love your work, Jaiden!
Love the reference to Vox Machina in the bar, love your videos
It’s a good day when James and Jaiden both post
This was great. I would love to see more animations like this. It’s such a fun story.
We need more dragonborn Jaiden
I remember I’d wanted to do D&D
Bro, Alpharad looks like Larry.
Pls upload more stories of dnd sessions
Yeah it sounds lots of fun, but i got no friends that nerdy 😅
That was great do more please
Seems like alpharad was only competent party member during fights
I loved this the characters the story the monsters all we good thanks jaiden
It is just me or can you see a few members from vox machina at the start at the in
One time me and my party were fighting huge spiders, me, a barbarian, picks up a little stone one big enough to fit in your hand, throws it at one of the spiders, gets a nat 20 and headshots it, it did not die
sure do love magick and monsters.
This was so cool and amazing you are so cool Jaden
5:27 I had a feeling Apharad was a closet furry for some reason. XD
I love the way you animated the story ❤❤.  It inspires me to play DND. I wanna play so bad now
You are such a good writer
THE VIDEO I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR !! JAIDEN AND DND !!
Can we all agree that alpharad has the funniest character design
Mark been going through a lot
THAT WAS A AMAZING VIDEOO
I love that Jaiden is now playing dnd. She has now played all of my Favorite  games.
james and jaiden releasing videos on the same day?! yes please!
9:51 adventure time reverence!
Roll initiative against the JORT STORM
You should totally post more of this
This feels so much like Dingo.
i REALLY enjoyed this, thankyou :)
God that was so cool and funny at the same time! Now I wanna try playing D&D too
can you play subnatica please
I love how alpharad's literally just Larry from pokémon. It made me laugh to the point of tears how comedically unlucky he was.
literally freaking out this is the perfect video for me
Mark's villian ark is better then 90% anime
Real
I love how jaiden and ranboo picked like non human creatures and alpha just picked a man who has alot of issues
Was save or die your second time playing?
the horse the goblins were cooking was from adventure time
I LOVE IT! I'm a D&D Player myself and I can say, that was a perfectly accurate game you had there. You animations made it even more awesome!
did I ever think Jaiden would even think of playing dnd? no did I wish I could see more dnd stuff? yes am I glad this happened? dear god yes welcome to one of the most concerning, chaotic and confusing fandoms I can think of
I loved that stream I did fan-art of it!
I once played D&D my character was an elf with a sprout coming out of his head which was possessing him all he ever said was “I AM GROOT” and he had a pet baby rat that he liked (I think)
Cheesebrbr
Raise your hand if you like watching Jaiden 👇
I never played it but seems cool 😮 Great work tho👏💯
Soooooo goooooooodddd 👍
This was amazing!!  I want more of this 😂😂
yooo
I knew jaiden was going to blast bbegs face off when she turned to the ex wife xD. It felt the same as when in a oneshot i was a harengon barbarian our group was talking to this celestial being that turned out to be the bbeg and me being barbarian of course didnt get it until one of our party members layed in thick on me and i instantly fired my bow at the bbegs face that was the size of a ballista since i was still enlarged casted on me and some other thing that i dont remember that made me and my weapon even bigger xD
This video was absolutely delightful! Bonus point for the Vox Mchina reference!!
I want to someday play Dungeons and Dragons. 😁
Saw that CR cameo 😂
I LOVE the Pajama Sam lookin' starter Inn!
Love the Vox Machina callout at the beginning!
Now that you have played d&d, I recommend pokemon tabletop united. C:
The person in the suit is Larry from Pokémon scarlet
As soon as jaiden transformed, i knew where this was going. Absolutely insane behaviour followed
Not me screaming at the vox mochina reference
when the friend group gets together to pull an all-nighter and eat tubs of ice cream:)
Idk why all of my dnd experiences, didn’t matter who I played with, would always evolve into us reenacting OPM scenes and fights
I once had my oarty end up fighting in a library that was enchanted. When a book opened, whatever was contained within its contents would just spawn. Also, why does Alpha look like Larry?!
my first DnD session I was  a full steriotypical American Dragonborn. I was a white Dragonborn, I had a gun, and I was named Ballde Stroyer, The DM(my best friend) let me shoot people's balls if I got a critical hit.
IS THAT THE NORMAL TYPE GYM LEADER IN POKEMON SCARLET AND VIOLET-
welcome to the dnd club, i love your animations
vox machina reference
All I have to say is... LAAAAAAARRRRYYYYYYYYY/PAAAAAUUUULLLLLL!!!
D&D is like a weird character creator to me lmao, I was once a magician guy who had a hat that could talk to me then I became the hat?? also I recommend Baldurs gate if u like D&D hah
I love how Alpharad decided to play Larry
RANBOO
Alpharad being Larry was Gold
The Dedede themes were a great inclusion.
Thank you for playing D&D
Beeb beeb I’m a sheep
this was such a good video
Paul  needs a friend like Larry
amazing animation. keep it up!
Give me part two of this story man I like DND and yet I have never play it befor
Yes finally I have waited for this
First hour gang  👇
i was in a dnd club with a bunch of high schoolers in middle school (i was like their baby or smth idk they acted like i was their kid) and we called our DM 'Dungeon Mommy'. we almost never finished a campaign because we got distracted so often and one of the party members was always a bird of some sort. she never stopped cawing and screeching and anytime she opened her mouth, one of us would yell something like "*****, i swear to god if you're about to make another bird noise, I'll rip your throat out" or her brother would just reach across the table and shut her mouth before she did anything.  we once acted out a genuine fist fight to solve a disagreement. i had the highest charisma stat so i flirted with any enemy we came across. my character was named Po, after the teletubby (i also had the antenna). 10/10 would recommend. (also being the high schooler's favorite middle schooler and being adopted by them is a highly underrated experience, would also recommend)
you know it's gonna be a good day when both jaiden and james upload
Omgosh I'm over here tearing up at the end! Good ending! I love to play one day!
As a huge fan of yours and dnd, this video was an absolute masterpiece
Here 😊
ah man... I miss playing my dragonborn T_T DnD <3
yooo i love dnd
Every time I’ve played dnd in the campaign I’m in, the others have wanted to use me as a fire genasi Molotov cocktail
wohoo
9:50 ADVENTURE TIME REFR3NCE
I can indeed confirm the amount of chaos that happens during a session. It is just like this.
I love dnd
This was one of your best videos imo
BRO HoW IS RANBOO HERE 💀💀💀
Seeing the upload notification is how I imagine baby birds feel when their mother comes back to the nest with fresh regurgitated worms for their sweet sweet nourishment
Paul really channeling Larry lmao  Also, GOD TIER Over the Garden Wall cameo.
I am not really into D and D but I did watch this gravity falls episode where Great uncle ford and dipper play dungeons dungeons and more dungeons but the game becomeea real after grunkle Stan roles the infinity dice great uncle ford brought home and grunkle stan Mabel and somebody else to save them
The fact alpharad is just larry in d&d is hilarious
1:25 omg susie deltarune
the lil' vox machina in the inn! this is several of my favourite things all coming together into one video, I love it.
I Did no expect Slimecicle In this
zoot turning into mark's ex wife and acid blasting him in the face is still the funniest thing i've ever seen
The vox machina is a nice touch
"Roll detection!"
1:15 did no one realize that those characters were from vox machina😢
5:29 Can't believe that Paul turned into  a  Brony
James and Jaden releasing a video on the same day?
I want to play D&D but don't wanna do it with randoms bbut don't have any friends who like D&D
very entertaining, thank you jaiden!
that was a WILD ride lol
Yay! A Jaiden Video!
Ahlpa being a Larry Clone is absolutely precious to me
Gotta love the critical role references
Do a Video on The HER Interactive Nancy Drew Games
This whole this is priceless and Paul's entire thing is my favourite
Love the Critical Role references in the bg
Larry?
Great Video! Would Love To See More Vids Like This With Silly Stories Lol.
Did... did Jaiden pull a Smoshgames and think a Mace (melee weapon) was Mace (the spray)?
That was awesome
32737th
I’ve never relate to a Jaiden video more than today I literally just played a small game of DnD with my cousins
I love ur vid pin pls?
9:11 Im dead 💀
HELP THE DEPRESSION COMAND IS SENDING NE 😭✋
I love that alpharad is just Larry 😂
wow this is video is funny and great you're so awesome jaiden ahaha
O My M San!
1:03 I THOUGHT SHE SAID GIANT APE-SHIT OAK TREE IM-
2:08 wow, Alfarad really went full on Larry with that line!!!!!
ME IN THE BACKROUND NOT SUBING 💀😶
I remember seeing the clip of jaiden and her point blank acid blast a few months ago, so glad we got a full video
😂❤
I've never played D&D either
I love dnd I’ve been playing since 6th grade
ITS SO FUNNY THAT JACOBS DESIGN LOOKS LIKE LARRY 💀
i like it so much pls do more vidio like this
Love it Jaiden! Tons of fun.
Pauls Design reminds me of Larry, if he had been a character in Harvey's New Eyes
I love how we just kinda forgot that ranboo was in aa timeloop
har
Poop
Amazing beautiful
I can imagine the side characters (the door especially) in Charlie’s voice and it is strangely fitting
Wow that battle with mark went from I hate mark, to I feel bad for him, to WHAT THE FUCK JAIDEN?!?
Pls do d&d more, i really enjoyed it
About god damn time.
I am, aswell, a riddle door
17:43 Over The Garden Wall Reference?
didn’t expect ranboo to be in this type vid but here we are
Finally new vid, and great vid jaiden
Let there be more D and D and also great job
Noooo they forgot the familiar
Cant believe she put in a vox machina cameo!
i love this is need more
yoo
Now Imagine this video with darkest dungeon sounds
I Hate Jaiden Haters...........
ball
Is anyone going to talk about Alpharad THROWING his son at a stick???
8:10 TOP 10 ANIME BATTLES!!
I hope you get to be a guest on JRWI.
Nice the classic 3-man band trope. It can totally work if the party has the right synergy.
Fun fact, it can be a board game. 25% of my family’s items is dnd characters and board things.
vox machina in the tavern made me LOSE IT ahhh this is such a beautiful video
give me more!
Hehe my fellow party member’s blood swapped places with their wheel of mozzarella cheese
oh baby lets go
The newer DnD movie was my introduction to this franchise. Tabletops ain't much a thing where I'm at. Trading Card Games take up that role here. Now I wanna try stuff like this. Seems like a fun, enjoyable and perhaps hilarious time.
Warlock Fighter Bard?
New Vid 'bout game I wanted to watch but didn't have time to watch whole VOD
I see ranboo, i see Charlie, I see jaiden, I scream and click. (Alpha was there as well ig)     Also PS, one time I made friends and then married a fae while we were battling
Jaiden and James on the same day? This day just got a whole lot better ❤
One of the best videos ever made by Jaiden
Would love to see a DnD stream from you Jaiden!!!
JACOB IS LARRY IM CRYING!!!
This was amazing
Sheep: 𝑚𝑦 𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑠 𝐿uop Jaiden: Ight, Lop it is 3:44
Am i the only one who thinks paul design looks like larry
This was such an oddly magical experience to watch
Less go ranboo
I always thought the game was corny but I’ve never knocked it. There’s so much you can do with the game that only the imagination is the limit. I’ve honestly never played it but I want to now
NEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDD
Paul is just Larry from scarlet and violet
I'm so glad you guys had a good time, it was a blast watching the stream :)))) dnd is one of my favourite things just in general at the moment, I was EXTACTIC to see you guys play together, and this was an awesome animation to watch you brought it to life so well :))) hope you do get to play again soon!!
I cannot wait to see how the adventure will unfold, please make more of these!
wait why didn't Paul jnr tell that he was his son or did the transformation worped his memories a bit
i saw that vox machina reference!
I just witnessed cinema
Alpharad’s character was definitely inspired by Larry from Pokémon SV
Part two plssssss
I love that Paul looks like Norman from pokemon violet/scarlet
15:52 work at a pizza place reference/j
ohmygod, big fan. What a oneshot
6:15 I would have said clouds, cause worms dont have tears
This sound like a lot of fun but ive never been able to play as I dont have any friends that are interested and most of them think its weird.
That trick you pulled on Mark was absolutely brutal and I loved it.
Thanks so much Charlie for Chuckle Dungeon 3!!
Alpharad being a larry is the funniest thing i saw today Now his chat can root for him and larry at the same time
Yo why does Alpharad look like Sanji from one Piece?🤣🤣
I love the part where the worm says “it’s worming time!” Then worms all over the place
Can I just say I love that Paul is just some guy in an "adventuring" suit? Simply amazing.
You’re not the only one who’s never played it before Jaiden LMAO 🤣
I've always wanted to play this game but I've never had the guts to.
RANBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
first james now jaiden? I am grateful for the animation gods
I love how Jacob is literally Larry from Scarlet and Violet 😂
Jaiden did you know about arakocra they are bird people
Wth😅 Mark is the real victim here
4:15 did anyone else notice The Beast from over the garden wall hiding behind the bushes?
The fact Alpharad's character looks 1:1 to Larry from Pokemon makes this so much better
9:51 The Adventure Time horse!😂
Its a good day when both james and jaiden upload during the same day
The first time I played dnd my friend threw a javelin through a child’s head for no reason at all
We played this exact adventure when I first started playing
this was stupidly funny thanks for the laughs
This was awesome!! :D
The laughing was SO FUNNY, SUCH COMEDY
peak fiction
Never would ever think I'd see Jaiden play D&D.
i love paul
As a thomas i can confirm i curse my neighbors with time loops
Stranger things.
I, Paul Kira will eliminate you
I love how Alph loks like larry from pokèmon
A James and Jaiden video in the same day. Amazing 🤩
Alpharad woke up and just decided: I want to be Larry from pokemon
only real ones remember seeing Jaiden's ultimate backstab play at the end on YT shorts with the one time she used the Vtuber avatar's heart eyes
10:19 that's a goblin tinkerer, they're the worst of them all!👀👀💀
That plot twist was crazy 😂
The day that you upload this, is the day I actually start my first campaign! What a coincidence. Wish me luck! 🤞
Command Spell “Depression” is the funniest thing I’ve ever heard. What a Rule of Cool, end the combat in 1 turn type of thing
My first D&D game I got kirbstomped by a goblin that was 5 levels agove anyone in my party. Sooo... yeah it was fun.
not even 2 minutes in and im balling over "ye old mart of wall"
A furry, a scaly, and Larry from S/V, the most unhinged group ever
Omg, Alpharad is Larry!!😂
I love how alpha's character is basically larry from Pokémon
Haha dead adventurer time hourse 10:39
CHARLIEEEE TOOOO
James and Jaiden uploaded a video on the same day? THIS going to BE THES BEST DAY
I think it'd be an amazing idea to contact Grizzly (Charlies DM) and see if you can't get a temporary role in the Riptide campaign like Ranboo once did.
i loved the original campaign and you excecated it perfectly in animation form, capturing the ridiculousness of it all!!!! easily one of my new favorite videos :)
I love the Vox machina reference lmfao
I loved the Vox Machina reference
Jaden and James both made a video  on the same-day
When the worm said "It's worming time" I literally starting sobbing I'm shaking and crying rn
yahooo ! ! !
As a DM who also watches all of you, I must say that this was surprisingly tame. I half expected an army of Karens to appear that were angry at Mark Thompson and Paul
can you share your character sheets please
There r only 2 genders 😔
I never really got into D&D but I love hearing the crazy stories that come from sessions. For about a year my best friend was a DM in his own game, and every now and then he’d tell me what’s going on in the story, like the time his character had to fight a bunch of anime girls, or an intense battle with his party members and for some reason Shadow the Hedgehog was there! It sounded so weird but because it was D&D it just made sense!
Alpharad as Larry is amazing
Slime rolling the dice in the background is so funny lol
My mother played DND once drunk, she kicked a goblin in the nuts and caused them to go into the goblins throat.
How long until the furry artists get ahold of Dragon Jaiden?
*I just tried dnd and then got this suggested*
I love this! XD
i would love to play D&D as long as i can make my own race that does not normally exist in D&D
Im so hyped to see more of these. Maybe a colab with dingo??
Thanks Jaiden. Rub it my face your ability to play dnd whenever you want, you and your little friends. Cool video, by the way, as always.
I was segregated from my colony for being a spring fae with ice like wing and naturally born using ice magic. It was found by the fae moon goddess and became a worshipper of her was sent out of colony to figure out why i was created for in the world
🤓
If we cant get more D&D stories from your amazing narrative voice, the world will be furious!
happiness
Fantasy mad libs
Ur the third sta animator posting today.
Read the title, liked immediately. ❤️
Possibly first to notice "The Beast" from Over the Garden Wall at 4:16 !!!!
RANBOOOOO❤❤
HELLO?!?! THE VOX MACHINA REFRENCE !!! :DDDD
I started playing D&D a few months ago and it's been some of the best expiriences for me. D&D is very fun and I'd love to see more
Paul is nanami fr
Charlie, Jaiden and Ranboo?! all three of my favourite youtubers in one video playing dnd?!
please tell us what kind of class you used
wow this video was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
ah, the "depression" clip! it's back!!
So… we getting merchandise of Zoot then? Like a plushie of some sort?
hey was that vox machina? hell yeah.
My friends and I play transformers dnd and my character is crazy statted for damage. I did 18 damage and the bbeg reflected it back to me.... I lived but HOUH BOY
8:22 HAHAHA so funny hope you have a great day Jaiden 😂
D&D is definitely a wild thing to get into, it's crazy and chaotic, but has a good community 👍❤
Alpharad looks like Larry
i always wanted to play d&d omgg
I’ve actually done this campaign before! One of the most fun I’ve had playing dnd!
My D&D campaign defeated the main level 20 wizard villain in like 10 minutes by just going past him 😅
Love that Jacob made Larry.
4:51 THE DRUMS OF LIBERATION
Paul? more like Lapharad
I literally laughed super hard with tears of happiness at 15:28 with the acid attack! Genius just genius! Jaiden you do the best to make me laugh super hard and I love it! You're amazing!
I can't wait for a recap of the next adventure
I love when you can tell everytime a nat 1 was rolled 😂
DEPRESSION!!! I am your wife; let me acid blast your face!
I remember my first campaign, and the first one I finished. Ah, such pleasant memories with people I will likely never meet again.
okay, the salaryman with a battle axe in his suitcase is kinda cool ! i'm pretty sure you can make something like that, like completely legit in "In Nomine Satanis" or "Magna Veritas" (a game where you play demons or angels fighting each other in France around the year 2.000 and the thing is, you're a dmon or angel soul incarnated into a human body, so you can be about anybody, I remember a demon of Belial (demon prince of fire) who was a little girl who was carrying a Jerican in her backpack and you can totally meet a grandma who's a demon of Baal (demon prince of war) who can throw cars at you if you piss her off !
Ohhhh i remember it from a stream! Ive never played dnd but i hope to some day :³
THE VOX MACHINA REFERENCES AT THE BEGINNING 👏👏
Moooooore pls
Ladies and gentlemen, we've done  it.
Is this when jaiden becomes a dnd storytime animator? I'm totally for it. Hope you'll have lots of fun playing in the future.
Yoo I had a feeling this was going to be a thing after those streams.
You know it’s a good day day James and Jaden both upload within five hours of each other
This is probably the best YouTube video I've seen all year, Jaiden has always had a talent for storytelling and using it to narrate a dnd session paired with beautiful animation and impeccable bgm choices makes for an unforgettable audiovisual experience. All I can say is thank you to everyone involved in the making of this video.
Yoooo D&D!!!
the moment you said slimesicle was the DM i immediately knew this was gonna be unhinged
I'll be honest, i kind of got tirred of modern day DnD...Everyone is either Horny, Edgy or wants to be one comedic sociopath who spouts ton of meta jokes. I miss just the simple casual plays.
Alpharad is depressed because his dad is a furry.
Jaiden looks so much like Susie from Deltarune and I’m all here for it
Tholemu saying that he’s in a time loop and it never getting addressed afterwards is honestly pretty funny.
15:25 the sweet sound of grief and overcoming the past AND PROCEEDS TO ACID BLAST HIM TO HIS DEATH (it doesn't kill him but its freaking hilarious)
This was amazing! If you choose to have more adventures I'd love to see more videos on them 😄
OMA GASHHHHHH ITAS BACK
SLIMECICLE LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO
It s so sad the Charlie wasn t a Player BC he definitywnie would do some funny/weird things
LOL Such a perfect video.
when I say i have never clicked on a video faster-
I've always want to try dnd but it seems very intimidating to start and understand. It's nice to know you also hadn't play before but still manage to have fun
oh my god I am so happy to see this group of people together! this is so cool :D
I can't believe you gave a man depression and hit him with acid!
Hamburger
Love this so much! I actually pretty recently started playing D&D for the first time with some friends and we’ve been having a great time.
This is the crossover I never thought I needed but in the back of my mind I've always wanted this and I'm in mid Jacob looking like Larry from scarlet and violet it's so perfect
6
Hats off to the Critical Role/Vox Machina reference. This was content I never knew I wanted.
I swear, everything of this video was AMAZING,Alpharad just going with a human fighter(?) is something i completly expected,the references made me crack up and one thing i loved was a detail of Jaiden's dragonborn sorcerer(?) (After the tavern blew up after casting speak with animals i assume she choose a Wild magic sorcerer) That is, the symbol on the tongue,like,that's sp cool!  Just seeing thos video pop up made me estatic,maybe because it's DnD but it doesn't matter because i had a lot of fun watching,keep it up!
(Blonde Larry.)
Best DnD session 😂, i hope it becomes a series in this channel.
okay but HOW DID I GUESS THAT LAUP WAS GONNA BE THE SON
Jaiden, that shill was actually one of the best I've seen. be proud of it.
I still can’t fathom that menace level action you did to mark
I will try to predict jaidens character card now based on experience  First of all everything will be level 1 and her rank will be dnd newbie
tomi
i know i sound like a robot saying this *BUT YA KNOW IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD DAY WHEN JAIDEN UPLOADS*
D&D and Jaiden make a pretty awesome combination! Would love a second video of any new sessions!
10:04  isn’t that horse ice king???
My first glance at Alpharad I instantly thought of Elias bouchard
I like how Jaiden is a dragon
the shock value of the actual dnd session when jaiden casts depression, disguises self, then acid blasts mark in the face i can never forget that
Is Alpharad Larry from Pokemon Scarlet/Violet?!?!
loved this video
I need more of this I love it
The Critical Role cameo was SICK.
You made ranboo look so cool
Omg the best people play DND this is amazing
I expected Jaiden to stab Mark in the back but a point blank Acid Blast well played
YES THIS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED❤
Jaiden / dragon
I see you making cameos in the background, Vox Machina!
within 1 hr hehe
naming the turtle paul jr sad asf ngl 😭
I love how you can tell where all the Nat1s were by all the goofy mistakes.
wha Alpharad look like Larry from pokemon
LARRY POKEMON
WHOOOO WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF SCREAMING AT A PEICE OF PAPER!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
I want more videos like this! Dnd adventures are allways fun
You REALLY have to make a sequel. It was soooo fun to watch!
What a fantastic one shot! I recognize the story hook of a person being turned into a sheep from a premade one shot, but I love how your DM Incorporated those little pieces of your characters' backstories. Great job on his part. Also acid blast to the face: ICONIC
Love the vox machina reference at the beginning, nice touch lol
Never been this early. Never played D&D. But I’ve always been interested.
I mean it's cool that you are playing it but we didn't ask 😂
This was awesome, i would love additional d&d stories
i wish i could elope with a ogre
I’ve never played it actually
I honestly feel bad for Mark Thompson. Like y’all, that cat and went and spread rumors about him that CAUSED HIS WIFE TO DIVORCE HIM AND RUINED HIS LIFE and then HE FREAKIN DIES DURING HIS HONESTLY WARRANTED REVENGE PLAN   (I love this video so much omigosh it’s so good)
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
This was amazing. If you don’t mind me I’m going to finally give D&D a try, thanks for the inspiration
Omg I love this so much
Jaiden nightwing dragon
Love the Vox Machina Critical Roll cameo!!!
Never thought I see Jaiden make a D&D video but it is very interesting still
When she said Charlie I thought she was talking about Moistcritikal lol, that would have been awesome
I AM SO HAPPY RN OMG
that was..... amazing
YESSSSSSS DND
Make it series or I will become a worm
Good job trying something new
Just how many nat 1s were thrown during that goblin fight???
It's wormin time is so funny 😂 hope you have a great day Jaden
The inner rules nerd in my really wants to know what edition of D&D this was and what spells were used here as based on the animation alone it seems a lot of this was rule of cool more than actual D&D rules
heloooooo
I love d&d! I have played a few times! I remember once being a warrior, and once a fairy! The rest I was the DM. I also love the character backstories, looks and color palette! As an OC maker I’m found of the character design! My favorites are ranboo’s and jadiens! Edit: the plot twist and ending is fricking amazing
iodhgfgisdhfihgusdgfsdgfsdhb THIS WAS AMAZING ive loved playing dnd so much and ive been playing it for 7 years now and seeing how your adventure went was amazing!!! :DDDD
I immediately thought tectonic plates as the answer to the last riddle
Everyone is getting into Dnd right at the time that I am, it’s so coooool
I saw what you did there Jaiden. A sheep, RAMpaging? Oh god.
Cool :]
Ram-boo not ran-boo idk how she said it
You are amezing
I loved every minute of that
If I'm not mistaken, Paul (not junior) is just Larry from pokemon SV
THANK YOU FOR POSTING
DND is cool I think
using the command spell with the word depression is so fucking funny xD
The most Dangerous weapon of them all, Depression.
yea but why's paul basically larry from pokemon scarlet and violet but with an axe
Yoooooo. Now I want to play D&D. I though D&D had cost money to play, but this sounds so cool! Thanks for the inspiration!
You haven't REALLY played Dnd if you haven't gotten tpked by a one in a thousand series of terrible rolls.
I definitley would've thought jaiden would go for an Aracockra or some kind of beastmaster
I listened to the VOD shortly after the stream aired.  I cannot express how upset I was listening to you all try to solve the clay puzzle by eating it and feeding a goat a rock with complete confidence that you had cracked the code when the door literally just said "make something."  Truly one of the Dungeons and Dragons moments of all time.
Ella is my dog's name
Paul was the absolute MVP and you can't change my mind.
ive played a school campaign
Looks like Alpharad took someone from a certain normal type gym as his dnd character 😂 he looks like gym leader Larry and acts like gym leader Larry 😂
YES!!!
this uploading right before the new jrwi episode is incredible timing (i love this vid sm)
alpha seems like normal type gym leader larry
Nat 20 baby - Marcy wo
This was such a great video, glad you enjoyed the game!
Can we see more Dragonborn Jaiden in the future? Please?
In a campaign I was in around 2 years ago, I played a bard who had just started to settle in with his copper dragon wife when a giant skeleton hand dragged both of them away. Throughout the first half of that campaign he was just like "I miss my wife, [ranger]. I miss her a lot." It was pretty funny.
IS THAT A VOX MACHINA REFERENCE I SEE?
DnD has endless possibilities
i just played D&D a few hours ago what are the odds!
ngl... yall were the bad guys😭
Third
Uh, I tought Jaiden would be a bird kind
God i loved this
i saw the thumbnail art and yelled “RANBOO?!!”
Thanks. I have been waiting for you to post forever!!!!!!!!
No way
Why is Alpha Larry?
I just started the vid and that sheep, Im calling it now the sheep is pauls kid who ran away  Edit: friggen called it
What a WONDERFUL VID!!!! Mannn automatically one of my favs!!!
DND with a bunch of teenage boys is very... questionable
2:42 And now you have Wii coconut Mall also from Mario kart Wii
Why does Jaiden playing a dragonborn doesn't surprise me?
ohhh love this, definatly want more, heard and seen clips of dnd sessions but never seen a fully animated session. i loved it might start looking into these things. please make more
Beautiful storyline. 10/10
DND is more fun when you make up your own rules we had a scenario like “your trapped in the dessert and desperately need water” I pull out my portable mansion😂
Jaiden came back to life to post a vid!
I love how Tholemu and Paul have goals and Tholemu has a quest to guide the group through and Zoot's just along for the ride
I really wanna see the unanimated version of this
it was SO fun to see a lot of this happen live during the subathon 😭😭😭
What a great spin on Wild Sheep Chase! I love it!
I was just thinking about starting it since a kid in my Biology class told me about it.
10/10 story
Jaiden playing D&D is fucking hilarious. Maybe we'll see Cosmo's Kitchen and them trading their dwarf for a loan to a sugar dragon momma.
all dreams have meanings my dreams:
This video is funny and great and jaiden is so awesome for rolling a nat 20 in the description                  Lol
Jaiden: * _DEPRESSION!!_ *
Yayy
OMG I THOUGHT YOU DIED… For the 26th time
1:16 VOX MACHINA AHHHHHHHHHH
4:15  The monster from over the garden wall That's such a good reference absolutely made my day😁
This is so stupid! XD
One of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us
video
I LOVE YOU JAIDEN IVE BEEN WATCHING FOR 5 YEARS UR AMAZING U DESERVE UR FAME LOVE YOU
Luap is a precious little sheep cutie and I'm glad he's okay.
I heard Jaiden, Charlie and Ranboo and I was hooked    (Sorry, never watched the last person personally)
this campaign is exactly charlie’s style of humor, which is an incredibly good thing
This was completely unhinged and thoroughly bizarre. Thanks Jaiden.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT ROAR OF DEDEDE ON THE END
Love that Jacob is just larry
charlie slmccl is one of my favorite youtubers, ALSO A DRAGONBORN PERSON, I NEVER SEE ANY
Our latest DnD game I used my spirit weapon and summoned an iron maiden then started shoving goblins into it and clamping their heads off 💀
I love that the Vox Machina cast is just chillin'.
everyone else in my family loves DnD i just nevr can find out why people love it
I would love a series where Jaiden just animates dnd, that would be awesome
Sounds like a great game.
Oh man, my party fell apart because scheduling issues, but before we did it was fun to no end. RIP Table-Leaf 😔
I remember my first time playing d and d and I absolutely sucked😅😅😅.
I forgot what breath weapon black dragons and dragonborn get. That was ruthless. XD
The fact that the final boss is a Walmart manager💀
i've missed you so much😅
guys im rolling this dice to see how much fun I can have. I rolled a 1
Man jaiden's my favourite utuber
I HATE YOU❤
Cinematic masterpiece
i was also a black dragonborn as my first D&D character!!
Slimecicle being DM adds the right amount of chaos needed for a wonderful game of DND
15:40 knew you were gonna do that because it’s exactly what I would do.
Hahaha, nothing like a stakes free one-shot!
I kinda wanna do this now,like honestly the only dnd I've ever done was a pokemon one
The horse from adventure time is a nice touch
Bruh i started playing last weak and i fell in a pit of lava
LOVED IT
Aint the first time youve been in a dungeon quit playin
the fact that this was Jaiden's first time playing DnD  is amazing to me
you are so good at making animations and I am trying to become an animator so could you make a how to video some time.
Amazing View
i reckon the reason dnd has been so popular for so long because of its freedom! there are no limiting factors like coding problems for programmers that somehow how to program every single stupid action that a player will choose, and thats why i think its the best board game ever.
Dungeons and Dragons is a game where the Geneva Conventions are a check list
I was genuinely not expecting those plot twists, mark and Thompson were the same person? Luap was Paul Jr?! Wow
So everyone is posting today. I’m just saying not complaining.☺
My first character was a Vengeance pally who got skullf*cked by an illithyd
My favorite part of the video was when the worm said "It's Wormin time!" And then preceeded to worm all over everyone, truly one of the moments of all time
I cant keep laughing cause alpharad made larry with an axe
I want you to know that anytime I watch your videos the only shorts that are recommended below it are cat videos
You know it's a good day when jaiden uploads
Alpharad really just turned into Larry
This is great
I would love more dnd videos! ❤
AAAAA I LOVED THIS SO MUCH!!!! paul is def my favorite character by far
I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN TO EAT THE CLAY TOO
this was an unexpected upload, but a pleasant surprise  (i love D&D) 15:28 🤣
Today is a GOOOOOD DAY
26 minute gang
Ooo any more adventures of dnd
12:14 Its so funny that Paul did the sign of the cross for gobble gob
Oh no Billy SirMeow worked on this one huh Gonna be listening carefully for the brapp
I really love that Alpharad's go-to inspiration for a D&D character is Larry from Pokemon SV.
Seeing you're friends with Charlie, you should definetly talk to that Slmccl guy, he seems pretty fun!
"Jaiden animations and freinds murder depressed man and give a sheep multiple concussions"
first campaign i join, i somehow summon an eldritch monster, and got a nat 20 on chanting for a cult and second campaign i join, i own a different cult for getting ANOTHER nat 20 on the SAME THING
"So long gay browsers the sheep" I'm dying
I like how Alphas character is just him drawn as Larry.
Yea I used to play dnd and wished I found it more fun but I just found it kiddish but now looking back that was peak childhood moments fs 😂
5:03 hah nice callback to the london video
Pouls hot
as  someone who has been doing LARP for around 15 years and has been playing dnd for 7 this is great
Nice animation 👍
One time when I played dnd I picked up a rock and threw it at the Emily and he died so then I emoted on his dead body
Hi jaiden love the videos
jaidens the silly of the silliest out there and I love her
DnD is an incredible game. I wish I had a group to play it with but despite my efforts, I can't find one.
1:36 when alpharad was about to talk to jaiden there was an ad right befire he started to talk
14:22 glad to see a spongebob reference. A+ tier video.
Why is ran being a bard the funniest to me
The more I heard about dnd the more I want to try it 😅
Missed opportunity for the bongo cat vibing meme   Great work tho
Amazing video also funny part at the end
WHOOOO!! That was so much fun to watch!! Welcome to the D&D fandom Jaiden! We're so glad to have you! ❤️🐉
I’m so happy to see Charlie in your style!!!!
I'm an a ice fae cleric
As a D&D freak. I am ecstatic to see Jaiden play the game
Paul kinda looks like Larry from Pokemon.  I’m happy I noticed that
Is it me or is alphared’s character based on Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet 😂😅
0:02 I see you have Mario Kari Wii Daisy circuit in the background.
LMFAOAOA THIS IS SO CUTE
LOVE the animations Jaiden and love to see more, I've been whatching your videos since around when you started and it's so cool to see where you are now
Hmm? Strange, there's a key detail missing. Your Familiar and warlock Patron... *I sense dark magic.* 🎩 ✨️
CRYING about Jacob Alpharad making fucking Larry into a dnd character 😭😭😭
I see that critical role reference!
Jaiden playing dnd with Ranboo ?? Two worlds have collided
So cool to see the session turned into an episode of Jaiden Animations! I love the dragon flying overhead at the end and hope it's some kind of foreshadowing
12:36 so long gay bowser
RANBOO??
Why does Paul look like Larry from Scarlet and Violet
I find this funny because i got a notification for this video right after i finnished a dnd session
This video made me laugh alot hope to see more
Yah an new animation
I finally see the scene of that one animated thing you also commented him in and it's just as good!
Ay vox machina
first.
I knew that laup eas paul junior all along 😈😈
When Jaiden said her character yells "DEPRESSION " I just laughed so hard
That was good.
Mark being a worm was completely unexpected 😂
WTF CON EL LORE AMIGO. TREMENDO PLOTTWIST
15:24 That when from Aww..🥲 to AAHHHHHHHH!!!! Real Quick XD ☠
algorithmic engagement
thats a weird start to a campaing lol
That whole depression and disguise scene was was amazing both in the live DND sessions and this.
This... this is just so deranged... i'm kinda lovin' it!
Sup. Love your content.
As a person who is about to play their first game of dnd thank you
15:26 why did i know this was going to happen 😂😂
14:46 is this a reference to when Jaiden told Charlie that one time how she would pose as a guy's wife to poison him?
im quite literally watching this while i should be setting up and preparing for my DnD session today, life of a DM is fun  eta: love the LoVM cameo at 1:15
I had so much fun watching this!!!! :D
....larry?
Wooooo! I love DnD, glad you had fun playing it
It's wormin time 8:22
I was laughing my a$$ off the whole time lmao
I was here for a bit of the stream, very funny
0:37 you look so cool doing that
Wow that’s funny I just watched the gravity falls dnd episode right before this video was released
Anyone have suggestion how to start d&d as i`ve always wanted to try it.
i love men
I would love to see a dnd series on this channel based on the utter chaos in this video
What I would give to play d&d with this group
A halfling bard named Rosemary rolled 2 nat 20s to cooking for a dragon a rotisserie chicken And then trying to befriend it Rosemary now has tea with the dragon 2 times a week
14:07 THE SCENE
i love your content so much jayden
This was amazing
As soon as Zou turned into the fake wife i knew what was about to happen.
My first dnd campaign was so crazy I committed multiple war crimes
That sounds fun
Love the little VM vinyette at the beginning, always good to see a pickle gettting drunk 😂
DnD and seeing Alpharad as Larry so funny
thank u for showing us ur campaign i liked it
Como sempre, os vídeos da Jaiden valem muito a espera! Nunca decepciona
Once I went to see a step by step guide to understand better. I completed all the steps except the last one, which I couldn't do "Gather a group of friends to play" 😑
"And acid breaths him square in the face" THATS D&D FOR YA
So Jaiden’s D&D session was basically the following: Puss in Boots, a scalie, and a -Walmart- Ye Olde Marte of Wäl employee go to speak to the manager.
Alpharad being Larry is absolute perfection
This is amazing
amazing vid. so freaking fun
I really do enjoy hearing peoples DND sessions, the absolute shenanigans that can occur are like no other
i do think that sound fun and i never play well i do make a dnd card but never really play as it was afterschool and the bus came
The design for Zoot is everything I expected and more, I also love how you made Tholomew such a little guy
role a 20 to kiss a giraffe
Dragons and Dungeons is kinda hard, specially if you have no friends.
Jaiden, I really wish you could upload more often, like maybe once every week.
Alphrad’s character being a fantasy equivalent of a depressed Walmart employee is the most Alpharad thing to do
Draconic Jaiden is so cute!! :D That's a ridiculous firs session I'd say, lucky you xd
This whole time I thought it was spelled "Luop" and I never would have made the connection
Can you make a video of your visit to Japan this year ?
I. Need. The. Highlights.
THE ENDS PLOT TWIST WAS SO UNEXPECTED
this is so funny! d&d is amazing!! i'm guessing Paul is a human barbarian, Tholomew is a taxabi bard, and Zoot is a dragonborne druid??
Oooh, she’s finally playing my favorite tabletop game!
I can't be the only one who thought zoot looked like susie for a sec
The entire Jaden community when this video came out: *insert moistcritikal clip* yeah baby!🎉
❤
I'd love to see more adventures!
Rancat :))) - Also I imagine that Zoot and Paul are just super tall and Tholemew is Ranboo’s irl height
Objectively rad
Seriously… 15:29
I just started working on my campaign, and Jaiden dropped this gem. A simple coincidence, yet it made my day
Is that a JoJo reference? “Mr. President”
OMG VOX MACHINA, I LOVE VOX MACHINA SO MUCH I'M CRYING, IM SO EXCITED
HEY! That was super cool!!! I’d love to see more of these!! There are plenty of D&D Animated YouTubers out there and it’d be cool to see someone else dip their toes in!
I could've sworn that jaiden would've pick a ranger or druid class since she could used ari as a animal companion. 🤔
That ending was everything I had hoped for, 10/10 now I'm going to go start a new campaign 😂
So cooollll
i wished this was live streamed smh
Words cannot describe how much I adore this video.
I sure love seducing ogres
We need more of these!
You should do this again I loved this vid!
I couldn't understand a thing the door said
Part of my party and I went to a lighthouse and I stared into the lighthouse light and blinded myself and I also accidentally killed my friend 2 times
m a g i c
Always a good day when D&D is mentioned (especially by jaiden)
I can see this as a disney ride
No but i can relate to players tag teaming attacks! One of my players threw another party member and one shoted the enemy they were about to fight! Dnd can be wild lol
Thats true its great.
I love that most of the music is from Zelda games
In my experience DND was more fun hearing about afterwards than actually playing it. But I’m too adhd to enjoy anything for long periods of time. The whole time I felt “I could have beaten Skyrim in the time we finish one quest!”
This video was awesome and incredibly funny. Love it.
2 OtGW references. Nice
right on time while i eat my pizza
A POST FROM THE ODD1SOUT AND JAIDEN IN ONE DAY… IM LIVING THE LIFE!!
This.. is the funniest shit ive ever laid my eyes in in my life 😂
This was amazing, did the whole DND section justice. I don't know why but the face at 2:24 made me laugh so much, you could literally see pure confusion there. Also the double nat 1 from Gobble Gob, the "so long gay bowser" (LOL) to Luap the close range Acid Blast.   So many memories from the subathon.
for anyone wondering, the ending song is called "Boo Night Fever" from the Paper Mario: Sticker Start ost just thought I should put that out there 😊
the first die i ever rolled was a nat 1 as i tried and failed to kick my apartment’s door down, resulting in me starting the adventure off with a broken ankle and 1 point of self-inflicted bludgeoning damage
I played d&d and just spelt every turn i get
I used to play dnd and it truly is fun. I dont play anymore but I have great memories from it
This was awesome! Such a typical experience of DnD I feel too! glad you had fun!
What an incredibly fun and tight knit one shot(?) What the heck?? That was so delightful, I love d&d
I love how jacob is literally just Larry. I was not prepared
1 h crue
Da queen is back baby she neva miss
i loved the video, keep the good work!
This sounds like a crazy campaign, I’m so glad you had fun! I’m in the midst of my first campaign too and I’m so excited
This do be sounding like some prime 3.5 E chicanery
Alpha just playing Larry. Iconic.
As soon as I saw the title of this video I was like “OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!”   Jaiden and I are the same person
Dragon jaiden is so cute, I love it.
D&D is amazing. *because I like imagining things* *that’s the only reason I’m an artist lol*
Me who has never played DND: Yea this is video for me
Alphrad is Lary from pokemon scarlet and violet
This game's a blast when homebrewed, I got to play a reformed conman tarantula named Ge'out. He named himself after the phrase he heard most often on door-to-door sales.  I also homebrewed a race of sentient math equations because this is a place of freedom
This was an absolute blast to watch! love D&D despite having never played it myself
THE WORM BEING THE GUY TURNING TO DUST GIF I CANT-
That was great!
my friend told me they ate like "magical unicorn powder" or something in DnD and i just kept telling them "[name] thats drugs" ive never played it but i wanna get into it
Yesssssssss
I hope this becomes a series on your channel. Id love to see your campaign journey animated if you keep playing
All four people i like? Playing DND? And Slurmclicle, dming? Sign me up
1:15 VOX MOTHERF***ING MACHINA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love how Alpharad looks like Larry pokemon
14:34 SO SILLY
RIP the ice king who was captured and cooked by the goblins, after being mistaken for a real horse.
I've played this dnd one shot story before haha it's so cool to hear how different someone else's experience was
This short campaign felt like an episode of Adventure Time, which is more fitting than you might realize at first, since the show was initially inspired by the creators' own D&D adventures.
The 1 in a quadrillion chance of Jaiden and James posting on the same day happened
1:40 damn that was deep😅
YES! Going to go play it now! After video edit, I actually played a version of this one, but it was a wild goose instead of a sheep because the dm thought it would be funnier
Early gang 👇🏻
Paul is a mood. Retail is pain. Paul JR is forever.
Another top notch video by jaiden
great video
"this was a different type of video" well no kidding. hope you enjoyed the session, dnd is a very interesting game. I wonder how long the session was? good job with spitting acid in that mark guys face.
this was something alright i really enjoyed it despite not thinking i would
Dude this is probably the best RPG of all holy Fu-
I just realized that Jacob's character is so much like if not literally Larry from Scarlet Violet.
Jaiden as a dragon is absolutely giving ❤
I remember watching that stream and like hoping that Jaiden would do an animation about it and here it is.
It’s great to know I wasn’t the only one who chose a dark dragon born that breaths acid for my first dnd character, their F*cking metal
That was amazing. I really wish I could find a group to play DnD in my country
This was so good! I especially love cat ranboo
That was awesome! I love your DMs idea about having the players sculpt their own opponents from clay. Very fun! Thanks for sharing. 💜
Hi I like food
The soundtrack for this video is awesome
Absolutely fantastic XD
14:46 OH YEAH! That time Jaiden made one of the most twisted D&D choices fucking EVER????
charlie slimecicle did WHAT
The Mark Thompson twist is on the next level.
kinda wished Paul was actually voiced by Jacob xp
excellent
Love seeing each character animated! When i originally watched it on stream I invisioned in my head what each character looked like so it's cool seeing your interpretation of them! Although i wish we could've seen the devil bird (which i assume was cut for time)
Its a good day when slimecicle alpharad and ranboo collab with Jaiden
Been playing for a year now. Roleplaying is funny, but all our success depends on the dice roll.
Hi
Does Roier know? 😈
I love that alpharad just made his character Larry from pokemon
Not me crying lol
Bro is literally Larry
I was NOT ready for the twist that Mark and Thompson were the same person. Also, blasting someone with acid at point blank, genius.
I love dnd. Have a session later today if it's not canceled again
14:00 the silly
ngl i thought the end was about to be "and then the bombs went off and then they fucking died" lmao
first james now jaiden man can this day get any better then our favorite duo upload the same day.
You else saw the video and thought she said DBD and not D&D?
jaiden on just roll with it when ??
That was so much fun! :D Thank you for sharing your first D&D experience!
as i`m about to close youtube & sleep, this video pop out and wrote as 'posted 2 minutes ago' =D
Lol lovedit it wasi funny ur one of myfav youtubers and streamers
Remember watching some of this during the subathon. That was so cool. Glad you were able to play for the first time after a long time of waiting  Edit: #5 Trending in Gaming? Well-deserved, Jaiden❤🎉
Yes! I saw Vox Machina!
The full session is so much to fun if people haven't watched it I highly recommend!
s
This was fun! I hope to one day get into DnD and maybe even play a game with Jaiden…
15:17 LOL that one caught me off guard 🤣🤣🤣
10:51 I love all the Adventure Time references! From Glob to the horse, these easter eggs are amazing.
I wonder why Alpharad didn't voice himself🤔
9:51 lmao the derpy horse from adventure time
Yeah ever heard of the chicken chucker
Jaiden, have you ever heard of the moon? If so, do you like it? Well if you do, then you should look at it today. There's an eclipse. Also pls tell slimescile that I love him
1935th!
Real shame u guys didn't play with Matt Mercer
Jaiden and the Odd1sout uploading on the same day!!! I can't even begin to tell you how happy I am😄😄
This is amazing <3
I can't help but notice how Jacobs character looks like Larry
Perfect content formula ,animating dnd campaigns (specifically one shots) works really well,good content
Alpharad being larry is u ironically amazing.
Babe, wake up! Jaiden DnD video dropped!  Funny thing. I’m actually part of my first DnD game as well. Although, some drama happened, and it’s on hold.
Hi
An odd1sout video AND jaiden video?!! W
15:29 Me with a water blaster when my friend is asleep
amazing video
i love how much paul looks like larry from pokemon
JAIDEN? DND?! THE WAY I CLICKED SO FAST
You, Odd1sout, and Mr. Beast in the exact same day??!?! I feel like a binge session is nessacary
This was amazing. I would love to see more content like this in the future!
Right off the bat, AGHHHGHHG! CHARLIE AS A DM!!!? More like Charlie as a DeMon! He is to chaotic evil to be a DM, picking your own nose as a joke will get you killed as you picked to hard and poked your brain.
God damn this was so AMZING!!!!!!!!! I can reven spell correctly I’m so excited!
that was the best thing ive ever witnessed
NOT THE ADVENTURE TIME HIPPO HORSE
Make more episodes of this DnD campaign PLEASE!
This was such a fun video! I should find people to play d&d
James and Jaiden uploading on the same day is iconic 🎉❤
15:21 is incredible
Jaiden likes dragons?
Who else wants to play D&D now because of this😂😂
I like how alpha is just larry with blonde hair
I SAW THIS LIVE AND THOUGHT IT COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER BUT YOU ADDED VOX MACHINA INTO THE INN AND IT GOT BETTER
Jaiden pitching the video idea: So remember that part of my platinum playthrough?  What if we made it even bigger and cooler!
Jaiden, Alpharad, and Ranboo what a trio
DO ANOTHER ONE
I WANT TO LEARN HOW TO PLAY D&D SO BAD
An old girlfriend of mine was into D&D. She offered to DM my first session, I agreed, on the condition that she left her clothes in the other room.  Context: It was just me and her
5:02 if I had to think of a rhyme   I thought of this on the spot   “ANSWER ME THESE RIDDLES THREE BUT THEY SHALL NOT BE EASY LIKE YOUR ABC’s Turn away now and you will be set free BUT BEYOND THIS POINT. YOUR SAFETY I CANNOT GUARANTEE”
nice
It really is amazing to see the disguise self scene is animation.
This video was so great, that I went from my TV to my phone just to drop this comment. Please make more like this, I loved it! ❤
PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE!!!!!! I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!
is that the adventure time horse in the cave?
Whats the song playing at the end 😭. Also I rmbr my first dnd session and it was chaos and it was great 💪🦫💃
RANBOO JUMPSCARE  YIPPIE!!!!!!
JAIDEN IS A DRAGONBORNE YIPPEE
the cat is so cute 😭
Ranboo would a anxious cat
15:32 bro went from pacifist to genocide💀
Nice we have actual background music even if the past videos had it but this feels like an actual cartoon
Almost felt like she posted yesterday
Paul, the people champion! Finally glad to see this campaign animated cause boy was it funny!
YES YES YES Ive been waiting for this
you know it's gonna be a good video when it is jaiden and DND
Nice voxmachina Easter egg.
I SAW THAT VOX MACHINA SNEAK JAIDEN-
I like how alpharad made himself as larry from pokemon sv
BRUH I ACTUALLY WANT THIS TO BE A MOVIE PLEASE
I love how Jacob's caracter its literaly larry from pokemon
That was amazing. I laughed, I felt vaguely sadness-like emotions, then laughed again. You should do more DnD recaps like this.
James is very cool
lets go, glad you tried it
Point blank acid breath after that touching moment 🤣🤣
I was literally just looking to see if you'd uploaded recently. I guess I'm psychic
NOT RANBOO'S CHARACTER LITERALLY BEING A BONGO CAT HSJHDJSSKHS
This reminds me of when doug doug did a similar thing with a simpler version of Dungeons and dragons
This was so enjoyable to watch!
I got so excited to see this that I kicked my feet tg like a leprechaun that js found gold.
I need more dnd content omfg lmaooo
That was an amazing story with amazing twist and turns.
Watching the dnd live was a treat and I’m so happy to get to relive this experience in animation form!
More dnd stories plz
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
jaiden seems like the typa guy to give someone depression and then proceed to dissolve said victim with acid
This video is probably one of the best videos that Jaiden made. I love this video!
1 hour club
This is so cool
Jaiden Jaiden Jaiden! Imagine this: ... D&D x Pokemon. You can play a pokemon adventure, in your own pokemon world with your own everything and play it like D&D mixed with pokemon.
Me and my group killed a dragon once  I was a goblin cleric cause yes and i wanted the teeth to make a weapon So after our trip back to town, imagine just see a smol goblin lifting a GIANT TOOTH
My first session we just made our characters and ate sandwiches. That was 7 months ago
CHARLIE
You should stream the dnd
Also why are they all they/their? Just wondering if I wasn't paying attention 😅
Odd1sout, Jaiden, and mrbeast upload on the same day.  WHAT DO I WATCH FIRST
LARRY ???
Comanding someone to have depression is a power move
15:28 *Proceeds to Acid Blast in the Face* *Critical Role Laughing*
Alpharad could play as anyone and anything he wanted! AND HE CHOSE LARRY!
i already love this from the thumbnail RANBOO-
Oh nice! A restructured Wild Sheep Chase, that's my go-to to onboard new players as well!
I have a great moment in DnD that I like to call "The Briefcase Blunderbuss"  Long story short, we had one of our party members get into a bag of holding and hang on to the outside of the bag with one hand and his "thunder cannon" in the other while peaking it's barrel out of the bag. (a magic blunderbuss basically) and occasionally popping his head out to breathe, Shooting anything in front of us. My character held the bag in front of them when we were walking through hallways in a crypt in one of our campaigns. It was effective.
James AND Jaiden post ON THE SAME DAY??? Things are looking up!
Those nat 1s that kept happening tho
14:44 Steven Universe Moment
Paulluap
great video, it truly encapsulates what a fun and chaotic game dungeons and dragons is.  Also love the reference to vox machina
Alpharad is my favorite JaidenAnimations character
Wish I had the focus to do D&D
In my opinion this would be an amazing show idea
Brilliant! Just brilliant.  And, of course, Alpharad is role-playing as Larry. Classic.
Not what I was expecting but ok overall good vid Jaden
I absuluty love jadens dragonborn ahhh! Just so happy to see jaden playing dnd❤🤣!
This was the most ridiculous game of DnD I've ever seen and it was hilarious. Y'all are a perfect team. I'd love to see a second part!
Glad you loved the game!  I was laughing so hard when I saw the Critical Role reference at the start!
Jaiden acid blasting Mark never gets old
How has it only been 19 minutes and there's already1800 Comments
When the worm said "it's worming time", and then proceeded to explode, was one of the moments of all time. Truly inspiring.
Welcome to the batshit world of Dnd
This was great, would love to see how you play BG3 xD
The riddle door has me so weak 💀💀😂💀
0:34 I think that was as weird for us as it was for Jaiden. Nice baby steps though! 😊
This was so heart warming I'm in the hospital because of heart burn I literally almost died WHY JAIDEN
surprised no one tried to flirt with the door
Hey... do you stream things like this on twitch? I would love to hear them live
"Everythings going to be... ok." *1 second later* "ACID BLAST! POINT BLANK, IN THE FACE!"
That was amazing
A NEW JAIDEN VIDEO‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
More of this I love this video
Of course Jacob's character is just Larry Pokemon
I saw this and didn't think twice to click it
As soon as I saw ranboo and slime in the thumbnail….. I knew it was going to be a good video..
I LOVED THIS SO MUCH! if you'd like to do more i'll definitely be watching
wow tbh i thought the depression moment was gonna be very dark but for some reason you made it a bit funny also jacob as paul wearing just a casual suit is cool
YOOO
Oh my god! Please upload more of these episodes!
SO SILLYYYYY><<
😭 rip the demon zoot made a deal with
YOOOO new Jaiden video on the same day as a odd1sout video. Best day ever
why was that like. beautiful
SHE ANIMATED THE DEPRESSION SCENE!
The entire time alpharad was just mainly Larry form the new Pokémon games
LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!:D
It's always amazing to watch animated recaps of people's D&D matches, and this was animated so amazingly. Amazing work everyone, this was so much fun to watch
PAUL IS LARRY CONFIRMED
I loved this video
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome oh look at that a nat 20
This sounds like such a fun oneshot, hope yall do more 😭😭
Ordem paranormal pfv na próxima temporada com gringos, coloquem a jaiden
RANBOO AND SLIMECICLE IN A JAIDEN VIDEO WHO CHEERED
I am 87,3% certain that I've met a Mark Thomsen... If I only knew back then, I could have stopped him!
Holy crap just finished the video-the  teams and yours drawings are so good Oml- best of wishes
I wanna play D&D but then I get lazy and forget all about it
I love how alaphrad looks like Larry

I and my literature teacher love dnd, I'm gonna have to show this video to her soon enough (I also play dragonborns too)
DM needs new dice
This is giving me a cartoon D&D series vibe and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!

I love how past ranboo always says they are not a cat but now he is dressed as a cat
That was sooooooooooo awesome ❤❤❤❤❤
This was the best D&D adventure ever
So many emotions
Ok that is d&d
Man, I love DnD. It's always the best of times lmao
This needs to be a show
8:20 this is so stupid but I can’t stop laughing at it lmaoo 💀
And then the dragon comes down and uses IMA FIREN MY LAZER but it missed
such nerdy stuff
Alpharad being built like Larry is something I didn't know I needed
That was amazing, truly a reason why I got into D&D recently!!
That was AWESOME !!!!
The realization at the end feeling kinda stupid I didn’t get it 😭
This is the most comical finale boss ever, just the walmart manager 😂
Love how jaiden animation tells these story's so well
nice adventure time refrence! wait, is ice king still in there?
That's D&D 4 ya! Still, disguise self into a nemesis' former lover....felt like i seen that before here on youtube. Not r/ kind of storied, but actually happens on camera..
This is just making me wanna play DnD for myself
Comment d&d if you like this video
Nice
Great animation
WOW that was eventful 😂
I now need to know if there is a live or a complete video of this campaign
AAA IT WAS SO GOOD
THE ENDING WITH MARK IS BUILT LIKE A WATTPAD FANFIC
Good job😊
That was super entertaining to Watch! Great video As always!
The stars have aligned; Jaiden and James have uploaded in the same day!
Jaiden likes Bard jokes? That explains why she doesn't complain about it
Oh my god please make more videos like this it was amazing!!!
👍🏼
Omg his son
Realest question, what version did you guys play. 3.5e or 5e?
alpharad being just Larry from pokemon is funny as all hell!
This had better be a series now. Because this is too good.
Hooray for the wind waker background music!
More dnd please
we finally got the Jaidenanimations Anime huh? Them bros attack failures tho are so on brand 😂
I was always kinda interested in D&D. Love your content and animation.
Epic
WAIT. Wait. I am nearly certain this adventure is based on a 5th edition module I ran YEARS ago.  Wild Sheep Chase on DMsGuild.
You guys, if you haven't, you need to watch the stream. This was probably the most I've laughed in years.
9:53 NOT THE HORSE OF ADVENTURE TIME, ICE KIND WAS INSIDE😭😭
OMG Jaiden played basements and big liza- Wait I mean Dungeons and Dragons!
yore god
double it and give it to the next person
Ranboo as a tabaxi is so cute
😂
Love your stuff Jaiden!
Ok my party ended up seducing, rejecting on a date then seducing again(because of my dweet muscles) a fallen angel
In a campaign, I saved 27 prize goats from a fire. There might have been a few human casualties, but the goats were fine!
I absolutely love this I love when you post!
NO NO NO it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
JAIDEN D&D VIDEO!!!  THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!! (Funnily enough just today I played D&D myself)
This feels like watching a Movie and is Good!
M
I love the recording of the player’s actual laughter to show a character break. 10/10
Dude you’re next one should be on the Pokémon championship 2023, cause I saw you modelling a magnemite in another video😊😊
This video is the best thing that happened to the world this week
Gee, I wonder what character Paul could be inspired by…
my first d&d session wasn't even done
No way! I just started D&D recently  I actually made a journal/Script thingy like that. I will put it below \/    Today was the day the storm started. The beginning. I was outside with my friend, Bob. And that’s when it started to get really windy and cold. We realized a snow storm was coming up on us. So we headed over to a Tavern nearby. We were really confused since it was the middle of summer and a blizzard showed up. In the Tavern, we met two other guys, Pretzel God and Cut Turr. We were all talking about the blizzard when Cut Turr asked another guy what was happening, all he knew was that it was coming from the North. Since I have been recently training as a wizard, I cast a fireball spell on a torch to light it. That way we wouldn’t freeze to death. We all went outside to look for some horses to use to see what was going on in the North. We eventually found a stable and stole the horses to cover ground a lot faster. After some time we came up on an Ice giant which was casting a spell causing the blizzard. He didn’t seem like the mean kind of ice giant so Bob asked it why it was casting the spell. The giant explained that a knight had shot an arrow through his hand breaking that hands power and thus, making the blizzard. Pretzel god helped him stop the blizzard and he rewarded Pretzel god with a giant Ice mace. The problem was that the mace was twice Pretzel God’s size which meant he couldn’t pick it up. Bob also tried to pick it up but still failed. But when I tried to pick it up, I used a magic spell that gave me super strength and I was able to pick it up. Later, we returned to the village and Cut Turr split up with us because he was a nice gentlemen who wanted to return his horse. When we tried to enter the village, they notice we stole their horses. I tried to convince them I didn’t but they didn’t believe me in the slightest. So, we stayed out of the village for some time. That’s when I saw something unusual. It was a large well with a tower over it that went so high, you couldn’t see the top. Another weird thing was that you couldn’t see the bottom of the well and there wasn’t any water in the well. We decided to take a risk and jump into the well. After a long fall and a weird spell that made it so we didn’t die, we found ourselves in the black market that we had heard about but never seen. Me, Bob and Pretzel God decided to sell our horses. Me and Bob decided to work together to sell both our horses and then split the money. We ended up selling our horses for 50 gold each. Pretzel God forgot how much a horse costed and ended up selling his horse for 2 copper. But he did gamble a little and make a lot of money. That’s when Bob killed someone for his stuff which I didn’t think he had in him since we had been living in a cave up to that point. After that, I noticed that I still had the giant Ice mace, but I also noticed I wouldn’t be able to use it, so I sold it for a whopping 51 platinum. Bob helped me sell it so I gave him 8 platinum for that. A little later, me and Bob left the black market because we had just struck it rich. Pretzel god had also struck it rich but he had other plans to stay in the black market and party all night while getting drunk. I left Bob in the town and went out of the village a little to find a nice place to build a home. That’s when I found a nice plot of land, so I staked the claim, and started the building process. I didn’t know what to build the house out of, so I went shopping for materials, sadly I went shopping hungry and all I bought was 22 tons of bread. Good thing it was crispy bread which meant it was the perfect material to build a house out of. I built a three story mansion with a pool. I felt a little lonely in my house, so I went out into the forest to find a pet. I couldn’t find anything so I used my natural likeness of nature to wait for a pet. Eventually, my favorite animal came to me, a duck. That’s when it started getting late, so I went to bed.
I broke my mouse clicking onto this video...
my D&D group is pure chaos. we've got a rizzy druid, a rizzy bard, a 12-foot tall robotic shark, and two elves who want everyone to stop with the chaos ;-;
THE ENDING
My first D&D game a grandma npc threw her broom like spear and killed a chimera... in one shot…
My first DND sesh was absolutely insane. I remember one of our members dancing on a chandelier to distract a monster in a chest. Then when we left them behind to continue our journey through the caves into a main room they were in the ventilation system asking to come in. 💀
Love the Undertale reference at 13:06
My d&d character. ur mom!!!!!
Command spell. You have one word.   “Uhhhh, Depression.”
I'm sorry but the unicorn at 4:13 made me think of McFurry so much I couldn't help but comment about it x)
YIPPEE JAIDEN AMAZING VIDEO :D
NEVER I THOUGHT ID SEE THE DAY WHERE RANBOO, CHARLIE, JAIDEN AND JACOB ALL COLLABORATE IN ONE VID OMG
Once me and my friends played dnd, I was a Dragonborn, and I seduced a dragon and it left us (after killing the rest of the party lol)

Happines dropped on this day

Paul just being blonde Larry makeshim my favorite

This was released 14 minutes ago and there is already 1606 comments jaiden has a lot of fans
Is this what drugs feel like?
yoo!!

Omg, 1 minute into the video and there was Vex and Keyleth 🥰
Might I recommend a DnD book “Ryoko’s guide to the Yokai realms”
4:15 the beast from over the garden wall?!
Both james and jaiden uploaded on the same day this is amazing
Love the Vox Machina reference!
1.6k comments in 11 minutes goddamn
Nah the depression command is on the same level as the ray that gives you cancer 💀💀💀
Hello jaiden nose ingles
4:33 WAS THAT A JOJO REERENCE!?
Can't wait to watch the vid! The Vox Machina reference at 1:15 got me ngl
Jaiden posted on the same day as James, pretty cool.
You know it's a really good day when both James and Jaiden uploaded the same day😎.  Even Mr.Beast uploaded today😳
Alpharads character looks like that one dad who forgot the milk when coming back.
I would've loved to see this actually play out. You 4 playing D&D seems so entertaining, and I know I'm right from what I've seen from this video so far
As someone who played dnd a couple times, thishsujrbfjdnsjdjjd
That was amazing. Brilliant job to you all, but especially Slimecicle, on a wonderful story.
My favorite part was when the giant worm said "it's wormin time" and then wormed all over the place
i love paul JR, hes so yippee
9:51 ADVENTURE TIME REFERENCE
Cant wait for dragon fanart
IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS DAY
Spotted Vox Machina. Nice touch
Is alpharads person js Larry?
this is by far your funniest video
11k likes before the entire video finishes
Alpharad is just Larry
I can’t wait to officially meet my girlfriend so she can take me to her DND sessions
i cant tell u how funny that is for u to call the sheep laab because that's a lao minced meat dish
0:35 you can see the influence that alpha has on jaiden after all these years (edited for grammar)
THE WORLD’S SMALLEST VIOLIN
“Jaiden is not a furry” then why is her d&d charater a dragon hmm
WHEN I TELL YOU I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW RANBOO IN THE THUMBNAIL! My two favorite creators ever!!!
Is... is that a blonde Larry?
ticonderoga
Plzzz doe een dnd live plz
I think Jaiden, you’ve made everyone want to try D&D, just like you did with nuzlockes.
Wow, seemingly so many Nat 1's
Am i the only one who noticed that the crown that ranboo made from the clay was a tiny tribute to techno? (It had a T on it soooo, but tell me if i'm wrong) great vid btw❤
Was that the beast from over the garden wall
I love slime Sicle
Hi
You know its gonna be a great day if jaidem releases a video
1:14 Always love a good Crit Role reference
WOOOO D&D PILOT
One time I tried to befriend wolves by unchaining them,they liked me! But they k worded my brother.
Jaiden is such a vibe
Is this the one where you gave a guy depression and then transformed into his Dead wife and then as he leaned in for a Kiss you spit boiling Acid in his Face ?  14:00 OH YES IT IS BABBIES
Jacob being like a Larry look from Pokemon Scarlet is somehow very fitting
Slimecicle design animated is perfect lol
please I need the VOD of this
Perfect reaction 3:30
Jaiden, pls talk with Cellbit to join the next Paranormal Order campaign
14 Minutes late
Hella
Yesssss I love dnd
Heya
Larry
I havent watched yet. But Ima send a like so I wont forget
"An invisible force they cant see" lmao
"Do you know Mark?"😂
jaiden video AND it's about d&d?? AND a TLoVM easter egg?? love this
This video is soooo good!! Also your character’s race is the same that I will be playing in my school’s DND club!!! 💜💜💜
Cool video jaden ❤❤❤🎉
the last time someone got turned into a sheep in a D&D game I am in we accidentally turned it into a pile of sentient meat trying to turn them back.
jacob really turned into larry from pokemon with that intro lmao
One of the campaigns I’ve done before was just like this one, with a talking sheep!!! ❤❤
I rolled a nat twenty on finding a good video
I find it funny how Alpharads character is just Larry with blond hair
This reminds me so much of my D&D SCP campaign, where my siblings, some friends and I played SCP characters and tried to breach containment.  I played my original creation (Midgard Centipede), which could grow longer and more massive, the more meat I consumed. I ended up loosing my growth buff seven times in a row, because of low rolls on Tesla gates. XD
D and D is my favorite game and i love that my favorite youtber played my favourite game yiippppiiii i
I audibly got very excited when I saw you made a d&d video, welcome to the darkside, take your cookie as you enter
9:50 The horse the goblins are cooking is the horse disguise that ice king uses in an episode of adventure time, neat reference!
YOOO have y’all noticed the little adventure time detail on minute 9:50, it’s the horse the ice king dressed as to spy on Finn and Jake on that one episode
The guy at the beginning must of been a Bard
Funny, my first time playing will be this week Friday
I always wanted to try DnD but just by reading some rules of it online overwhelms me
yes
Knowing jaiden this is the most sane story that can be created between her and others
Yes i liked my own comment
LOVE DND, DND IS AXESOME. WOOOOOOOH.
This story is so good wtf
This was so crazy lol
I’m so jealous I want to play DND with ranboo and slimesicle ☹️
8:00 *N O O T N O O T*
D and d = tommyinit
Odd1sout and Jaiden video in the same day? We’re goin to the dungeon wit this one, bois
Who else is waiting to see jaiden give someone depression?
Jaiden deserves an Oscar for the amazing work
15 minutes and 20k views?
Jacob's character is... so him
9:51 man they killed the horse from adventure time
I thought Paul was Sanji for a second. Anyone else see that?
Jacob just made himself Larry and I love it
When Jaiden playing D&D>>>
Here
D&D sounds really fun!, I don't have enough friends to play it with though.  Well... I don't have friends in the first place. w<)
Didn't you already play with Pchal amd friends at SaveOrDie? Or was this earlier?
So I think tholomew is a bard, Paul either a barbarian or a fighter, but I have no idea what zoot is
OMG THE ADVENTURE TIME REFERENCE AT 9:51 ITS THE HORSE FROM THAT ONE CREEPY EP (i forget what ep)
So what happen to other Paul Junior?
God i love dnd
every session of dnd is chaotic in its own way
I really need an animated series of this! (I felt I was about to cry at the end)😿
Jaiden is slowly becoming a games YouTuber.  and I like it.
Paul reminds me of like Zoro and sanji ig
I would ask for a counter for how many 1 roles they got but the way Jaiden tells the story you don’t really need one.
I like to eat ice cream
Hiiii❤❤❤❤
First time I made it to a jaiden upload before it showed “one hour ago”
dont think that vox machina refrence went unoticed
You know it’s a good day when jaded and James upload a video
I love all the references in the shadows in the forest
The references in this video are absolutely amazing. Thank you for this Jaiden. I am glad you enjoyed D&D
Hi
My day just got even better with this upload :)
1:16 VOX MACHINA!!!
cool im early
I love dnd and I am happy you played it Edit: Part 2?
I love this this should be a series and if the character were voice by there player
1:30 do you have a brother sir and does he like both treasures and eatery?
i was here
Early squad!!
I love this one-shot premise. I've seen a few posted versions of this adventure and it's so funny everytime. Glad you had such a fun game!
constant reminders of last year's failed halloween one shot the dm failed to remember just how stupid we were in the main campaign he's running and one of the players accidentally ended up getting possessed by the big bad about 5 minutes into the game but because he didn't have a plan for if any of the players ended up having to fight each other without the story actually starting first we had to call it off i'm not even kidding bro we just started the game, hadn't even spoken to an npc yet, and decided "yo let's go the obviously wrong direction towards that mansion that is very clearly intended for higher level players"
Is there a vod for this?
I remember watching this live. It was so chaotic and fun
Sad you skipped your bird
I’ve always wanted to play D&D no one will play with me 😢
You just made this video and now how does it have so much views and likes already?
The only thing I know about D&D is that whenever you roll a 20, it's equivalent to becoming god for a turn or something
Nicee, a Jaiden story video!
ooh, i been waiting so long for a video on your dnd sesion, so this made my day
I love watching charlie play D&D, and I already watch both Charlie & Ranboo, so this is an absolute win for me
Jaiden used *"Depression!"*   That was super effective amount of EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
this is so CUTE,, friends tried out a dnd pokemon crossover a few months ago and gosh, everything is so fun! it is a first exposure to this stuff so i am pretty nervous, but it has washed over for the most part. hope we will be able to play again later on
Hier Van there be 1500 comments Ehen the Video come out bevor 11min Thea can t Even Watch it Til the end
ITS WORMING TIME
A Wild Magic Dragonborn, a Barbarian Human, and a Tabaxi Bard walk into a bar ... ADVENTURE!
D&D is fun
The chulk as the game master.
Time to meet will, mike, lucas, dustin, and eleven
Wow, this just confirms that I NEED to finally try DnD for myself, thanks :D Great Video!!!
We love our mythical enby dragon and cats 🐢🐉🐈
The fact that the Ice King’s horse costume was being cooked at 9:51 lmao
NOT ALPHA BEING LARRY FROM POKEMON (also not the meeting the party in a tavern/pub)
Ah vox machina
YEAH JAIDEN UPLOADEDD
Shouldve named the turtle Mr President
I like D&D.
OH MY GOD IM GONNA WATCH THIS RN I LOVE D&D SM 😭😭😭😭😭😭 (EDIT) IM TEARIB UP I WATCH JRWI SM AND THE SECOND I SAW CHARLIE I TEARED UO MAN IM FREAKIB OUT AND WATCHING THIS ON MY TV (EDIT) UPDATE IM DRAWING JAIDENS CHARACTER RN
Being an animator is probably like the best for dnd. Especially just being an artist too.
Nice Over the Garden Wall Beast among the forest creatures. Also, really cool that a video came out a day after I stared watching these videos.
glad the subathon dnd made it into a video
Love how blond Larry is one of the main characters
Yeah a pretty good rendition of d&d game lol
Alpharad looks just like the depressed pokemon gym leader guy (also very funny video brightend up my day)
OH this is that one shot with the polymorphed wizard right?!
Jaiden is peak rizz😂
Jaiden animations and thesodd1sout post on the same day

Not the adventure time goblins and horse.
3:19 rip old oak inn (also i love the cat)

The Odd1sout and Jaiden posting on the same day? Truly a time to be alive.
1:40, oh, so he is Larry from Pokemon, ok
I love how I imemdiately knew what adventure this was lol. Great video!!
Ive heard of this game so many times, definitely gonna have to play it sometime. I had no idea how much you use your imagination. Perfect video to make a video out of. Amazing job 💜
I absolutely love the refrence of Vox Machina in here!
isnt paul just larry
She stole the horse from adventure time when the IK spyied on Finn and Jake, ironic because adventure time is like dnd
This is the First time seeing ranboo and Charlie playing with Jaiden makes me hype
I almost choked when I spotted Vox Machina😳
Why the fuck did you try to spray me with mace?! 🐑
How was pokemon championships?
PAUL IS SO DONE I LOVE IT 😭
finally, a new jaiden video. i love your vids :]
0:57 ranboo be like rocket racoon
Yes! Finally an upload!! 😮
funny little though popped in my head so....  alt title dungeons and angry ari screeching
No one will like me ever
Legend Of Zelda WindWaker music is Peak
Alpharad just being Larry Paldea
Did anyone else notice the Beast from Over the Garden Wall?!😮 Also noooooo not the creepy horse!!!! You will be remembered 😢
Gotta love how high fantasy Jaiden and Ranboo went with their characters and Jacob just went, "Imma be Larry/a salary man"
I personally play Monk-Way of The Open Hand to be fast and hit hard all the time, like a glass cannon on speeeed.
I play dnd too much this video is perfect for me
A video made 10mins ago wow😅
I love this channel
bread
I love Larry Pokemon.
Alpharad is just Larry but with an axe
Emaging if you do the QSMP Minecraft server enough times with ironmouse you could end up becoming a future Vshojo member because I have heard that you have a more likely change of joining Vshojo if you collab with the members enough and become there friends
Y’know I’ve been hearing a lot of stuff about D&D lately. What’s all the hype about?
The design for dragon Jaiden (Zoot) is adorable.
All of my favorite youtubers are putting out videos today, I am happy.
Am I the only one who notices the amount of youtubers using Mario Kart music has increased?
Comment 1.5k Hello please 😭
YES! BLACK DRAGONBORN!!!! that was my first d&d character too ^-^ (edit: this is amazing! i'd love to see the highlights when you're ready. Hope to see more content of your d&d adventures sometime!)
Its always great when she posts its the highlight of my day
I caught some bits live, I was very surprised to see this group of people collab. I love the internet sometimes :)
i love being a dragonborn in dnd i feel so silly like what do you mean i can just burp fire like hell yeah??!!
I loved the vod for this game!
so Paul is just Larry right?
She better give us the table top version on her “Jaiden” channel I wanna see the bickering between jaiden and the sheep
The scream I scrumpt when I saw Vox Machina
Funny thing when idv put dnd as a game mode for the 5th anniversary my friend infodumped about it and I listened   For three hours.
the horse from adventure time
me when jaidenanimations dnd video {i've spotted a critrole reference!}
Welcome to the community
My team and I once got banned from traveling to over half the map. Fun times
I love how Alpharad is just Larry from Pokémon but blonde.
Ranboo as a cat was something I didn't know I needed
I always wanted to play it but never can. It's kind of sad, actually.
Every time she makes a new video Christmas comes early.
Should Jaiden try Magic the Gathering?
The first time I play dnd was at my country house petty cool and have a nice day
one of us! one of us!
Love the table in the bar that just casually had Vox Machina
Paul may have list near everyone is his life but I think he may have a brother named Larry also suffering in the Paldea region 🤣
Your animations are always improving. Great work Jaiden!
friast
they just made Larry's depression more dramatic
“He accidentally said worm, I think that’s the answer.”   “Don’t listen to him, he’s a zebra.”   I mean, yeah. I guess.
Love you videos Jaiden
"it's worth the wait" has never made so much sense
this video is gonna be amazing
Jaden posting is what Brightens my day. Keep on smiling you socially awkward lady 😁👍
A dragon ? I assume Jaiden would be a bird because you know..Ari.
I love your animations jaiden it’s the reason why I animate
1:15 i spit out my drink seeing Vox machina, Idk why i didn’t expect them in a video about dnd
I love how Jacob literally just made Larry.
what is d&d? havent started watching yet, blame yt unskipable ads
woooooo
Paul looks like Larry from Pokemon SV
*sniff* *sniff* do i smell a possible sub series? Just saying
hello fellow dragonborn
Paul is Larry from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Horse that the goblin is cooking is from adventure time
yaaaaaaaaaay a dnd VIDEO!!! These are my FAVOURITE
Right so, alpharad is a barbarian. Ranbo a bard, what is jaiden
I just noticed how alpharad's character is based on larry from pokemon
Woo an odd1sout and jaiden video in the same day what a treat
The visual of Jacob and Larry combined is fantastic
I CANNOT BELIVE THIS WAS 10 MINS AGO.
I hope you had a good time
I played this one shot!
ok
MAN I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO PLAY DEAD BY DAYLIGHT BUT NOOOO ITS JUST DEGEUN AND DRAGONS WHAT THE ######
YESSSS VOX MACHINAAA CAMEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My OC/sona is, in my opinion, good for D&D. He fits as a Rogue (I guess) Dragonborn, and wields twin dagger things. Maybe it’s because I designed him while writing rp stories with friends
Seems like a fun campaign, hope y'all have/had fun! Dnd is such a great game, so fun to play!
A GOOD DAY IS A DAY WHERE JAIDEN UPLOADS
Alpharad being Larry is crazy
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees more d&d enjoyers
I would love to see this series continue!
Paul
it feels illegal to be this early lol
Thats actually super cash money
ITS WORMING TIME
i really do want to play d and d it looks good really good vid by the way
i love your channel Jaiden Animations!💗
8:22 It's wormin' time
YAY!JAIDEN POSTED NEW VIDEO!
RANBOOOOOOOOOOOO
I never played DnD because I heard the game can go on for hours and I am bad at admitting for something for a long time D: (I have ADHD)
i love dnd and jaiden videos so this is amazing
Animater Arabic 😌✨
New Jaiden Animations video?! On my birthday?! Jaiden, i love you so much, girl!❤❤❤
In one of my first sessions, me (a half-orc paladin) and our dwarf barbarian went to go beat up a man who drugged us and stole our stuff. We ended up taking everything he owned, including his house. Which we turned into a bed and breakfast thqt spawned so much money😂
So early
Not only is today a good day because Jaiden uploads, but a video about D&D with references to those who are emersed in it's community
I’m along time D&D love and i still love it, no matter the stress or anger.
I love how Alpharads character looks extremely similar to Larry from Scarlet/Violet
How has it been 8 minutes and there is 1000 plus comments
I would love to see the whole game without drawing, just the dc call
Turns out Ranboos name is actually- idk if I should say this
he do is charlie/slimecicle/charlie slimecicle
was just watching ur previous videos, this made me feel better thank u!
When I saw the title, I was immediately excited because I knew this was going to be an exciting video.
How on earth was this posted 8 min ago and it already had 7.8k likes
1:14 I did not expect to see Vox Machina
I was NOT expecting a Slimecicle and Ranboo collab with Jadiananimations but IM SO EXCITED FOR THISSSS Edit: Zot is so funny I love them
D and D
Love how Jacob just decided to be Larry lol
What is this blessing? ODD1sout and Jaiden on the same day?
Kirby music 🔥
I am loving for the windwaker music
0:56 NAAAAWH ALPHARAD'S CHARACTER ROCKING THAT gen 9 normal type gym leader STYLE!!!
I SAW VOX MACHINA, JAIDEN YOU GENIUS
Anybody realize that Alpharad is just Larry from pokemon
Jaiden, Alpharad, Ranboo, AND Charlie? What a great mix of people to play a first DND session with🔥
I have never played D&D before but do have the Starter Kit and Essentials Kit on my shelf. I would absolutely LOVE to get in D&D but.. have trouble actually starting.
A D&D video? huh...I wonder if she'll mention Critical Role or Legend of Vox Ma-  1:15 There it is. lol (Nervous Keyleth is so cute)
VOX MACHENA 1:17
I see the critical role nods.
What a coincidence, I’m starting my first campaign on Monday! I’m extremely excited!
Jaden messed up instantly when she made Charlie the god
I always wanted to play D&D and almost got the opportunity when I thought I finally had a friend group I could vibe and play this game with, we met up created character sheets, bought all the equipment, it was fun ...aaand then the friend group fell apart and we eventually lost touch and now I don't have any friends yet again😞.  Anyway, love your vid!😸✨
Seeing Jaiden acid breath a person was truly something.
6 MIN 1.3K Comments
Here before a hour
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS CONCEPT LIKE 20 MINS BEFORE THE VID CAME OUT. I WAS LIKE "I wonder if Jaiden will ever fit into d+d?'
I love watching Jadens Videos and Twitch streams ❤ And is always makes me laugh
of course alpharad would just make larry
I’ve always wanted to play D&D
1,325th comment
Waking up to a new Jaiden video is like waking up with no random body pain
If you were here before the video turns 1 day old 👇
The earliest ive ever been lol
I only played this game once and I didn't play again because nobody asked me to play it with them. Also can we get a plushie of Ranboo's character please?
Good to have you back Jaden
new vid nice
1:15 is that a vox machina reference??
0:56 ranboo as a cat is so real
Jaiden is literally me in D&D
i like this video
This is just as weird as every DnD run I've ever heard of and I love it
dnd is so fun when you have no idea what your doing
I played this campaign
Love how Alpharad is just Larry.
Whoa jaiden this video is awesome on so many levels to begin with though by the way, great job I'm really proud of you.
I would go nuts if you play any character in Paranormal Order (pls Cellbit make it happen aaa) Absolutely love your content and your character in QSMP ❤
Charlie as a DM is  *a very poor decision*
Not Charlie as the dm 😭😭
Yippeee
Why do people keep saying that this game is for gekks and nerds  and they are dumb
"suddenly, a sheep crashes through the tavern windows" (my out-loud reaction screaming to this moment: "FUCK I KNOW THIS ONE-SHOT!")
1 hour game 🔽
I love this so much!!!!
this days amazing so many peapl postimg even jaidem
such a good group to play with!
One of us! One of us!
Wait Ranboo..?!?!?? 😲
.
new jaiden
i just realized alpharads character looks like larry from pokemon violet
Seeing slime and ranboo in Jaden’s art style is so weird to me but I love it
I’m not the only one who thinks Jacob looks like Larry from pokemon
2 furries*
Hell yeah!!!
Never thought I'd see Critical role animated in a Jaiden video! Such a nice little cameo
Jacob’s charcter is the best
Who else spotted vox machina on the way in ✋
everyone wake up new jaiden post
You know your day is gonna be great when jaiden and theodd1sout upload on the same day
yay a new video
Hi jaiden animations
How this vídeo got almost 500 comments if this vídeo upload in 3 minutes💀 (sorry i speak spanish and i'm a bit Bad speaking English)
Alpharad being Larry is something I didn’t think I needed to see
Jaiden and friends should have a dnd Podcast.
Hey... Does anyone roleplay?
The video is funny and great and Jaiden is so awesome. So says I, compelled by the nat 20 in the video description.
paul is the only one who was not an animal but he is now my spirit animal
I want to watch this live so bad
Ayoooo, VOX MACHINA! Les freakin gooooooo!
NOT ME ACTUALLY DESIGNING MY NEXT DND CHARACTER WHILE WATCHING THIS
1:16 VOX MACHINA!!! I'm so happy :)
No way, Larry is here sponsoring paldea!?
2 furries and Patrick Bateman find a turtle in the woods and get turned into three furries
Ranbalt
0:49 I’m sorry, Ron-boo?!
15:22 favorite part
SHES BACK
OH MY GOD YOU POSTED YES i thought the riddle answer was zaza lmao
One time in DnD both me and my friends were fighting a slime and there were down and I was on 1 HP so I “showed the slime a good time” and rolled a 20 and we lived
IV’E WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS
Paul is literally Larry from Pokemon scarlet and violet, i mean literally, look it up, it's the same design, same concept, i love this video.
1:15 Vox Machina 🥰🥰🥰
I need to play D&D again lol
OMG! Odd1sout and Jaiden Animation both upload on the same day? Cool!
Here first 😊
I’m playing PathFinders rn
New amazing video
Yes Vox Machina!!
First pin???
it was funny and great and jaiden is so awesome
The fact Jaiden is an Aro/ace queen, who decided to be a dragon born in her first D&D game.  Those who know, know.
Poor Paul 😅 all the troubles he has fought 🥺✊
DND LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this sm help
After 2 months she finally uploads no to wait for another 2 months for a new video! 😀
OMG IM LOVING THIS 😭✨️ This is the most perfect recap in history✨️✨️
I’m finally early for once! Jaiden is the definition of quality over quantity
yey
OF COURSE ALPHARAD'S CHARACTER LOOKS LIKE LARRY
dude DnD is one of the games that i would enjoy most but i can't play it i don't even have anyone to play with. And you can say just play with others in online groups but man im just afraid to mess it up for these random strangers.
Monokuma cat
I've never played D&D either and now I might try it out with some of my friends!
You know its a good day when Jaiden uploads
JAIDEN!!!!! :DDDD
DnD scares me, I feel extremely dumb because it seems incredibly complicated to me-
What happned to storytime?
I loved it when Clay Worm said "Its wormin time!" and wormed all over the puzzle room.
God, your animation style is so good. just seeing  makes me erupt with joy and whimsy as well as imagination keep up the amazing work
Me when I dnd
You should do more of this stuff
Bro I play dnd and I love you that you like it
My favorite D&D story is when my party and I entered a cave, to where these was a giant orc, in a bath in one room, as this was some orc cave I guess, and he stands up and we get a full view of his orc schlong, and hes just as suprised as we are, and when talking about fighting him, I bring up the idea to our druid to go, and I quote "antman on him" and go really tiny and well...yknow, and then turn into something big from the inside, unfortunately we just ended up shooting arrows and throwing daggers at him.
:D
Y'know this dnd reminds me of the "wild sheep chase oneshot" that i read over reddit where the introduction felt really similiar. I guess Charlie used it for his campaign which is really cool.
Ah, great minds think alike. You play as a Dragonborn as well. If only I had friends that would finish a campaign
Her class shall be an asexual ogre aka Fiona from Shrek
How is there 1k comments yet the video was released 6 minutes ago
ALPHARAD
That sheep things feels straight out of Prepare to Dice
Paul is me every day.
I love DND and made adventure creatures heros and lands for years for now and i am writing a book about one of them
I love the dice that people make for DnD I have so many.. I’ve only played DnD once..
"sorry I have never done that before. It felt weird." I love that anxiety kicked in for a moment. Anyways, welcome to our great community of people who actually read books from time to time
I downloaded D&D on my phone and never played lol
First an odd1out video and now a Jaiden video. Todays a good day
5:25  BRO I WAS RIGHT it was zebra! 😂
I was so hoping her talking about Baldur's Gate 3 but no it was just reglar D&D session
W video
I got into DnD back in 2019 with some friends from my university anime club. I’m still playing with the same group of people to this day, albeit online now because everyone graduated and the rona happened.   I’m a DM now and in a few weeks I’m meeting up with that same friend group in person this year for the first time in over 3 years. I’m very excited to have an in person session again.
Yo vox machina
First
Best vid ngl, I liked the ending😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Welp I guess I don't have the itch for D&D I guess I'm unsubbing sorry Jaiden.😢
i needed this
Let’s go
James and jaiden the same day 😮
Claim your here before 1 mill here 👇
I've never played D&D but it looks fun
have u guys even watched the video yet before commenting
Rediscovering Jaiden after all these years is reminding me how going home after school and watching her religiously felt
' One Hour PeOpLe ' Just...ew
Ok now when are you going on Dimension 20???
YOOO CHARLIE!
I got a great idea why not do a Pokemon dnd Nuzlocke :)
Jacob is Larry 💀💀
Alpharad as Larry is hilarious
15:17 Just gonna drop this for anyone who knows what the best moment of tbis whole escapade was.
How could we get so lucky to get an odd1sout video and a Jaiden animations video in one day?!!!!
How does this (it’s still really good but how) get 10k views in literally 4 minutes. I only get one view in a week
Oh of course ranboo would be a tabaxi
Poor Paul
Hi
😢amazing
As I lay on my giant Ari pillow and gargle 20 sided dice, I can't help but think this is the perfect video for myself
Hi!
I was just checking today to see if you'd seen the video. I mean, the animation. I watch the videos on the other channel, too. And it just came out. I can't wait to watch it.
Thalomule was trapped in a bar
1,070st comment
more please!
Furry artists, don’t even make dragon Jaiden fanart
Obrigado por o vídeo ❤❤
FUNNY BUT MORE PLLS
Ok so Alpharad is Larry I LOVE THIS ALREADY
Ive been waiting for this
You never even realize how much she puts into her videos and scripts till you check how long her videos are apart. So much love to jainden❤
Alpharad would make larry his character
Whoa I was JUST making my new campaign for my friends right now as this video was posted! NICE!
I love d and d so much
First🤯
I’m just saying but the same stuff happened to me in D&D
5 minutes in and Paul is already iconic for me.
I feel like a dog when it's owner returns from the store, I'm so happy
Just got home from library D&D club and watched this video Today is a good day
Is Alphrad a reference to Larry from the pokemon games-😅
Yes! Ranboo! My two favorite YouTubers!
Having this more like a movie is certainly new and intriguing!
I just posted a dnd meme I made in a chat and 2 minutes later jaiden makes a dnd video I’m dying rn 🤣 (everyone in this chat is a jaiden animations fan)
YOOOOOO VOX MACHINA
0:35 jacob is rubbing off on you I see
That sub plug was hilarious😂
i wish we can get her old animations back its just not the same.
Love your vids!
If you need pointers my sister could help
JAIDEN are there any cool events coming up!?
I am a simple man, I see dnd I click
Dnd is the game where literally anything can happen because yes.
no way, jaden upload
You always make amazing videos <3
I see “The Beast” at 4:15
i love d&d sm one time that i played my character made the villian date them so this is how we won XD
Jacob is just Larry from Pokemon scarlet and Violet and that's amazing
fantastique
recently i've not gotten enough of kobolds. and i thought that jaiden was playing a kobold lol
How do y’all get here so fast 😭
4 minute gang!
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh
Jaiden AND James uploading on the same day,its a good day
VOX MACHINA?!
Well, time to go see Honor Among Animators
As someone who has been playing for years, I really hope you didn't forget how modifiers work!
Holy cow. A MrBeast, Jaiden animations, AND Odd1sOut all in one day? Wow.
I don't know, if it is a coincidence, but, since I've got into dnd, everyone around me sterted to also get into it: my friends, my sister, my groupmates... And now Jaiden uploads this. Either it's all a gigantic coincidence, or I have been bestowed with a dnd-fying aura by the RNGesus
Was that vox machina? (I spelled it wrong)
honestly, jaiden just made me interested in DND.
Love how Paul is just blonde Larry with trauma
The long waits are so so so worth it. Every time I’m blown out of the water at how amazing the video is
gonna be honest, i expected you to be an Aarakocra or any bird like race    very good video tho, love the animation
As someone who has played DND, it’s scares me
hi jaiden, this is rly out of context, but i am obsessed with your voice. it’s so pretty ❤
That Vox Machina reference gave me life!  Also, the fact that Jaiden, who is asexual, chose to play as a Dragonborn is a funny coincidence in my eyes.
Ah yes, let the chaos begin
Before even diving in, I'm guessing that Alpharad rolled at least 3 Nat 20s for the craziest of things. Let's see.
This reminds me, I should probably learn how to play D&D Update that was epic I should really learn how to play D&D
How long Jaiden!where were U
Once during a one shot we had to go to the shadow realm to stop this insane angle woman from ending the world and  my boyfriend described her in such exquisite detail that I started simping HARD for her. So I started flirting with her for jokes but apparently I rizzed her up so much she wanted to do the devil's tango and that ended up with us getting married. And that's how I single handedly saved the world
Paul reminds me of Larry from Pokémon
Xd
I love how Paul is pretty much Larry from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet 🤣
I got a nag 20 plus I’m a dark elf and have advantage on rolls against persuasion
James and Jaiden posted a video on the same day? Talk about a 2 in 1!
Now you can play Pathfinder 2e! Which is like DnD 5e but better and free!
wow, a board with out a board xD
Good job 👍
I just love to watch these Jayden videos❤
HIS TIE WENT FROM GREEN TO BLACK AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Dungeons have been Dragoned
how did i get recommended this literally 2 minutes after it was posted i havent even watched this channel in like eight months
I've never seen D&D animated before This was an amazing experience
im currently working on a theatre production inspired by dnd and now jaiden uploads a video abt PLAYING dnd is this a sign to also get into dnd myself (´Д`)」
It’s always a W when jadien posts Also Jadien has basically became a game channel at this point
broo it’s only been 3 minutes danggg 😭
Ive been playing since 2017
Imagination
*a literal random thing* *Jaiden animates it* IT'S TOO FUN AND WATCH IT LIKE 99 TIMES
Im hear in an hour!
0:56 I love the fact that Alpharad is just...Larry...but with a battleaxe
I started playing DnD last year in highschool its lit
I love how Paul is a Larry reference!
s
paul is like me.  i am a paul
I just realized that Jacob's D&D character looks like Larry one of the best characters in pokemon scarlet and violet the buggest game on the Nintendo switch
I've only heard of D&D because of a Land Before Time YTP I watched a long time ago.  8:01 WAIT! GUYS!
THIS WAS POSTED LIKE A MINUTE AGO HOW IS THERE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CHAT
I tried to ask one of my friends who usually runs the campaigns if she could teach me how to play d&d, but she kept making excuses of how long it would take for me to start, how it would stop their progress that they were making already, ect... so I couldn't learn how to play with my other friends since she was the only one that knew how to run the game apparently
sweet
dingo doodle collab incoming? :0
I love how a minute in there is a critical role reference! I loved seeing their campign 1 characters at the tavern table. I'm about to start a dnd campaign with some of my friends and we're all playing for the first time so im super excited!
Hi That was amazing
WOOOOOO DND, YAAAAAAAAAAA
under 1 hour 👇🏼
Paul is literally Larry
LET’S GOOO
JAIDEN POST!!!
Lol
CHARLIES THE DM?!
Good video Jaiden🐉❤️
Ohmygod
mor d and d
Is it al redy 1k pipole has komented
It’s nice to see two of my favorite story time YouTubers posting today
Good day when jaiden uploads
It's been awhile :D
Jacob is my mood right now
I've always wanted to play it but i don't know where to start or with who to play cuz no friends of mine actually know d&d
I love dnd
I love this channel 🙆
Yipppeeee
BRO THE WOX MACHINA REFRENCE THO
The video I didn't ask for, but the video I needed
Jaiden: makes a video about DnD Fans of DnD:WHO SUMMON US!!! Me who never sadly played DnD but hears or watches about it:who also summon me
She remebered her YT pasword...
I agree with describing Charlie Slimecicle as "God"... He's literally floating above my roof and saying fish jokes right now...
YAYYYY WAITED SO MUCH
Currently playing a campaign while watching this with friends .
Wowr
W video Jaiden
New vid!!!🎉🎉🎉
FIRST ps: your welcone james :)
If young me knew that ranboo amd jaiden animations played dnd together I would have passed out from shock and joy (also love the video ❤)
Finally my two favorite things combined together, a Jaidenanimations video and dnd
WAKE UP JAIDEN POSTED!!
JAIDEN YIPPIEEEE
Paul can withstand a meteor strike unscathed due to how depressed he is
These 3 are not something I expected for a Just Roll With It venture, but I am far from complaining
I love how Alpharad was designed as Larry from Pokémon lmao
That's my friend it sounds like a bard, the naturally charismatic people of d&d, if you hear stories of bards flirting with things successfully and basically marrying and sleeping with as many creatures as possible as just a Bard's nature. Although not all bard are flirty, but through the power of song and persuasion checks and all of that good charismatic stuff they can be incredibly useful to party.
I like how the Zoot’s face resembles Susie from Deltarune.
Anyone else love the vox machina characters cameo in the beginning
1:15 vox machina?
Apharads fit just fits him you know?
SPOILER!    Jaiden is absolutely savage for pretending to be Mark's wife XD
Hiiii!
DND is so much fun I made a Tiefling that hates other tiefling that when he encounters another tiefling he’ll want to fight and if he wins the fight he’ll take one of the horns as a trophy 🏆
Apologize 🙂
A new ANIMATED video, let's gooooo
OMGGGG YESS ITS HAPPENING
Lol I love that since the DnD session I thought Jacob's character was just the "Larry" of Dnd. Glad to see that reflected in the animation <3
hell0 jaiden you've posted again!
Yo siempre intento jugar calabozos y dragones pero nunca encuentro a alguien que quiera jugar conmigo 🥲 Jugamos calabozos y dragones?
Imagine if she decided to play warhamer 40K instead of Dungeons and dragons
How the heck did Jaiden get 8.5k views in 3 minutes!?
1:38 How Larry’s Back Story Happend In Scarlet & Violet Be Like:
did James and Jaiden post animations the same day on purpose? or accident?
WAIT I THINK IT SOUNDS FUN BUT IM ALREADY SUBSCRIBED oOoOoOoHhHhHhHh NnNnNnNOoOoOoOoOoOoO
Thank you Jaiden, Now, all my friends will magically be into dnd now
Phenomenal, this is the group of 4 i never thought i needed in my life
Jaiden uploaded this the day I'm going to a dnd game. That is pretty neat!
Why does this sound like a dream
D&D RAAAAAAHHHHH!!
Welcome to the hole. (I play dnd)
"You maybe could subscribe- sorry sorry!" hahaha
oh hey
Holy shit
James and Jaiden posted on the same day, thats great
❤❤
Both jaiden and James posted?! Best day ever
I was in the middle of texting my bestie, but when I got a notification from YouTube that jaiden posted, my bestie kinda got ghosted. 🙌🙌🙌
D&D + Jaiden = DEAR GOD, WE ARE NOT WORTHY OF SUCH A MIRACLE!
Jaiden and james uploading in Like the same day, wow
This is super funny
Bro now I want to play D&D
Jacob Larryrad is great character design

1:42 Is it me or Does it look like Larry?
DND is my life
Bard❤
I HAVENT played and now I need to it sounds so amazing and with my friends it’ll be a very… good experience and someone would probably get us killed saying some of the most stupid thing like a nuke spawns above SUS and kills us all then will role a 20 😭
i feel like charlie is the last guy you want as a dungeon master
Man alehphard is character is relatable and reminds me of a certain Pokémon normal type gym leader
spaghetti
DnD is awesome
0:56 larry pokemon.......?
THE FACT I WAS THINKING OF JAIDEN PLAYING D&D LIKE 5 MINUTES BEFORE THE NOTIC APPEARED,,
Hell yeah
I love how in the bar there are the Vox Makan party, i love it
"if you don't think that sounds crazy fun then I don't think we would get along and you should probably unsubscribe.... but if you do 😏" ayooo?? 😭 Jaiden I didn't know you like this
Was about to sleep but then "jaidens playing dnd" oh shit
It’s happening oh my goodness it’s happening
Jaiden you are so good at making content ❤❤❤
Yoooo
jaid
Raunboo
Only 10 seconds in and this is already my favorite thing ever (also the use of the outset island and dragon roost island music made me smile like an idiot omg /pos)
Dont you think i missed larry, alpha
I'm flabbergasted 🎭. In a positive way. I love this.
You’re the best
Hello
Absolute masterpiece

I love how alpharad's character is just a person in suit
Paul looks like Larry from Pokémon scarlet and violet but with blonde hair

I thought this was a live stream
Alpharad, Livin’ Like Larry!
Not even 2 minutes in and we get a Critical Role reference 🤩
Damn Paul’s story😭😭
Jaiden I love you:D❤️
So far interesting
You know it’s a good day when your favorite animator draws your favorite streamer

IS THIS THE D&D GAME CHARLIE DID WITH THE JORTNADO?!
no
a DND story + jaiden's Phenomenal artistic talent? you know this is gonna be a banger of a video without even watching it gotta like 28sec into the video
Dude, i was legit watching jaiden videos just earlier today and was thinking, ”there haven’t been that many video’s recently (except for streams those are fun) one will probably be posted soon” and now this is here. i feel like i just told the future
Paul!
This is a nice video I really into d&d so it was nice to see this video
Paul is literally just larry from Pokémon and I love him
I have been waiting for this video forever
Charlie and Ranbooo!!!
Only true JaidenAnimations fans can like this comment.
Yo is that Vox Machina? Crazy.
I remember in my DnD Experience, my character Jyn had to walk through a whole room of legos spread out the entire room, and left with blisters and cuts all over their foot- 💀
lol i have been playing D&D since 2013
I love your vids keep up the good work! ❤

I can't tell if there was a critical role or vox machina Easter egg in it
The tavern start with some rando walking up to you is amazong
i love how jaiden always finds a fun new thing to make a video of like she always has something cool.
I'm a tabaxi cleric who just got the subclass rouge 1, because she likes to steal stuff, 2 she really sucks at being a cleric
I SEE VOX MACHINA
charlie and ran look so cool in jaidens style lol  also zoot :D
Seems like a good first session to me, well done. ;-;
VOX MACHINA!!!!!!   1:13

A moment I’ve been eating for!!!

Of course, when doing some dnd rpg thing with a pal has been on my mind lately, this happens. JUST tried rewatching one of these videos too so, gotta love it.
Lol, tomorrow I'm going to play d&d for the first time too
Jaiden I’m a huge fan of urs my content is based on urs but with no storytime YouTubers
They may be the best group of people who could play together.
Love the vox-machina reference at the start
I can’t wait to see the fan art after this episode
omg paul amazing love em
Guy in the suit looks like Larry from come on scarlet and violet
My dad is such a DnD nerd, I’m sure he’ll love this video. I’ll have to show him later  Hope you’re doing well Jaiden! Much love to you! 💜
Raise your hand if you wanted to play D&D but never did 🖐️
Greatness
0:57 is this deltarune?
Im a simple man. I see ranboo, I click.  .. and jaiden ,:)
I love DnD, so when I saw this video I was like "SCREEEE YESSS"
i play D&D you are now one of us
Your so cool
I knew you F'd up when you left charlie to be GOD HIMSELF
RANCAT REAL???
Bro I started playing my first game 3 weeks ago and I have been hyper fixating on it since, so this was like serotonin overload
Love seeing Vox Machina in this!
i love dnd I got a nat 1 5 times in a row
😮 VOX MACHINA
I'm such a big fan of dungeons and dragons. I'm glad you made a Video about this
DND YESSS I LOVED PLAYING THIS AT SCHOOL LAST YEAR
My first time playing D&D I was verbally berated for being shy and quiet and having a basic character because I'm shy and quiet and had never played before so I have decided to, not, play D&D 😁
loved the reference to vox machina
I think i'm gonna play dnd now
780th
I love the Vox machina Easter egg
0:49 THE Ranboo Live? With Charlie? Oh this is gonna be insane 😂
She posts this as I'm watching the D&D movie. This is a sign O:
Loved seeing Vox Machina in the bar
Idk how people play d&d when anything can happen. Also never thought that Jaiden would play d&d with mc youtubers
This was really cool ⭐️ I love your videos:]                                                        Also first 🤭
Sup my homie
One time while I was at a summer camp, I was playing DnD with some friends there, and it was really fun! I sadly never saw them again after then and I wish I got toy hang out them more!
D&D
Love Jaidens content❤
🎉🎉🎉After 2 months SHE ROSE BACK FROM THE DES!!!🎉🎉🎉
this was so fun to watch live, i can’t WAIT for jaiden’s animated take on it (she’s been talking about it on stream for weeks)
Hi
This is going to be great!!!
I know this is gonna be a good vid
A Jaiden video about D&D?! Hell yes
w collab
1 min ago oh wow
Finally, my favorite channel playing my favorite game
Top tier vid from top tier animator
Hello
Glad to hear that my favorite YouTuber is a liker of D&D
Haha what a great time to post! I just finished watching all of your nuzlockes again! I have always wanted to play D&D. I haven’t seen much of the video yet but when I finish I will edit this comment.
Are the sessions recorded?
The Vox Machina reference gave me life
No way I am a dragonbron to when I play lol
Bro I thought she wrote DBD 😅
RANBOO SLIMESICLE JAIDEN ALPHARD COLLAB?!
I remember getting a set of D&D dice for Halloween
I love dnd!I already know this is gonna be chaotic with Charlie and alpha playing!😂 Edit:this reminds me of my crazy dnd moments(I one shot an npc with a nat 20 because they wouldn't tell me what I wanted,and I ended up blowing up the town and and the noise attracted a whole horde of goblins that ended the campaign)
YES!! You should try a Druid Necromancer. You can hear the chairs.
"me, alpha rad, Ranboo as the players. And Charlie Slimecicle as our DM" ...on the horizon of a forest path-
Estuve esperando esto por mucho tiempo 😃, la referencia a Vox machina me encantó
Nice to have Daisy Circuit playing in the background from Mario Kart Wii, It’s also coming back to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Booster Pack course this Holiday Season, And also other courses from Mario Kart Wii.
hi. (colleen)
Hi Jaiden I wanted to tell you that i lobe very very much your videos I am practicing animation because you inspired me :)
JAIDEN DRAGON REAL??
Vox machina ref!
Never thought my favourite animator would make a video about my favourite game!
Charlie as DM is literally the best way to start a first D&D campaign that man is not a Dungeon Master but a Dungeon MASTER
I charisma checked a bunch of skeletons and called them my “Skeladaddys”
My two fav animators posting together in one day? I am happy. :D
I’m a late 2000’s kid so I never got to try the game cuz no one really wants to play.
I googled 1 minute ago  When does the next jaiden animations video come out 😂
D&D 🔛🔝
Wow yesterday was thinking about how much you have be making more streams and less videos
I just played my first game a few weeks ago. It’s so much fun I wish I started years ago
Hey! Been a while since uve uploaded jaiden! Havent watched it all yet, but im sure its a hood video! Keep up the good work, even if it takes u a while!
🤣🤣🤣
AAAAAAA YAYYYY! I JUST GOT OBSESSED WITH DND SO THIS IS PERFECT
ITS CHARLIESW
you make very good videos
0:40 years I've trying to get my sisters to join a campaign I've made..... and finally they might just do it because of you.... thanks Jaiden
Me and some friends literally just started a dnd game during physics class because we got bored. Also for some reason I always rolled perfectly when I used charisma as a dragon.
And first to like
I’m gonna add “Elope with an Ogre” to my bucket list, thanks Jaiden.
Woooo just checked my subs and boom new video 20 seconds ago lesgo
dnd is indeed pretty fun
my character killed a 14 year old with magic missile once

WOO 17min VIDEO
D&D LETS GOOOOOO
OMG I'm first
ah yes, 4 views, 2.1k likes and 538 comments. makes sense.
The critical role reference 😭😍
If anyone has been to a comedy show with a sibling this exact joke has happened to them
When the world needed here most she came
D&D and jaiden never would have guessed
Even on the absolute worst days, getting a notification that Jaiden uploaded is such an amazing comfort, especially when you’ve been hoping she’d play D&D one day
I got this notification while watching a D&D stream... I am unsure how to feel
Me when I roll nat 20 on a good YouTube video 🗿
W the video we all wanted!!!
I love your videos so much! I can’t believe I saw this 20s after you posted it! Also I heard if you say your favorite creator’s name 3 times you get pinned so: Jaiden Jaiden Jaiden
THE SLIME GOD IS HERE! KNEEL BEFORE HIS *GOOEYNESS!!!*

WOOOOO DND VIDEO!!!! 💜🩵
Ngl D&D is really good and goofy to the point we have a after school club for it but seems like a great game
literally my favourite group of people 😫🙏🙏
D&D sounds so fun but I don’t know where to start.
Hello jaiden i hope you have a great day
"but i used my charisma stat to seduce him and we ended up eloping together!" literally every d&d game ends up like this i dont know how.
DnD is so frustrating sometimes. Like some bosses are too hard bc the gm just hates us
First
BOBBY CHINGUN!!!
Re-subscribes.
One minute gang
Always a great year when Jaiden & Odd1sout upload on the same day, true blessing
Hello Jaiden 👋
Two storytime animation videos, IN ONE DAY!  Golly it is a good day 👍.
As a d&d player, this is so relatable.
Gracias Jaiden por este video!  Te conoci por qsmp eres increíble! ❤
0:30 I'm unsubscribing
D&D is the best
Love how I’ve just watched the dungeons and dragons film and this has popped up 😂
W video I love it ❤ (why am I commenting when you just posted)
I’ve always heard of D&D but I haven’t tried it. But there’s a reason because I am lonely :( either way it seems fun!
I WAS ABOUT TO PLAY DND IN LIKE 2 HOURS LMAO ALSO HELL YEAH I LOVE SLIMECICLE

Jaiden your a great animator keep up the good work ❤
D&D is one of my favorites, I play with my cousin and some people at our school and it was so much fun. Someone’s character is named tiny and is a giant, so we just send Tiny on stuff.
What a day for animation subscriber
This video got me into d&d thanks Jadien!
