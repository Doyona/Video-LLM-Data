You could always make it again without the cremes
I don't think you're making these types of videos anymore but, I would have loved to see you do something similar to this, but use your mini mixes to water marble, i think it would look pretty cool and the color sceme is nice.
I'm living for The 50 shades of grey reference
Anyone eles think she should do this again now that holo taco has grown so much
Allo holo
I'm late but a cool name would be "Holo Mayhem"  Aka Hello Mayhem
Name it mother of holo
Can’t believe Got Cake is already retiring! I love it❤
This is way late but “All Holos Eve” for those Halloween vibes
12:23 Christine used the word demure before it was cool
Cristine using the term ‘demure’ before it was a ‘thing’
Imagine doing this now with over 200 polishes
Holo taco supreme.
I wonder what it would look like if she did it now
I need this again with all 200+ polishes
Not Christine saying “Demure” in 2020
A little demure👀
12:27 DEMURE!,!,!,!!
yess very demure simply 12:25
Name for the polish that could work: polish mountain in a bottle
You should do this again now there’s way more holo taco
All that and a holo taco! Like all that and a bag of chips 😅❤
I love it so much 😭
Party mix
I m kinda sad since this video is not a collabration with Safia the mother of frankens
I can always tell how old one of cristine's videos are based on the intro
THE MELANIE MARTINEZ REFERENCEEE
wait omg me and christine have the same b-day
Simply everything. I think thats a cool name
Happy BIRTHDAY 🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉   WOOOOOOO
Midnight 🌙
Call it simply extra
Happy  birthday Kristen
the cremes mixed look so much like cold slate!
Please do this again in the next stream!!!
I wish she had painted at least one nail with each of the mixed groups before mixing them all together. Some were so pretty! And, btw, the Got Cake? is gorgeous!
Ok but the multichrome and linear holo ones were just little sneak peaks for the second anniversary collection
I want all of these as holo taco colors
Midnights:
the glitter and flake closeups are soo satisfying to watch
Holo taco madness
The name should be “ a little bit of everything all of the time”
Cris you should do an updated version of this!!!
Please do it again!
Holo everywhere
Holo nacho
Hearing her say Remix and Dark Rainbow kills me
I would loooove if she’d do this again! I think her stream would love it haha
I'm very late but I would really love to have a shade like this from holo taco!
It should be the all taco 🌮
Is this how everything taco was born?
Hey Cristin , it only took 4 shades to make grey 😅😂😅
Should we redo this now that there are way over 100 polishes?
I think we need a update 🥰
You should call the Polish holo explosion
it’s amazing how much more she has out now i would love to see her do this again
Looks like a galaxy, Stacey Taco
first two seconds of the intro me: back to cristen doing thing that some one hight would do but she not high...ehh maybe the nail powders are getting to her.
holo you doing
I love so many of the glitter/Halo/shimmer/decadence/ but will you ever make them gel?
"Holo Galaxy"  You have the holo but it kind of reminds me what the night sky looks like when you look up at night or when I think "outer space" this is the color that I see
Screw Black. From watching Safiya and your mixing videos, the universal color is that Berry Purple color. It is everywhere
not simply made or 100% simple
The birth of violet nightmares and the dark Holo rainbow!!
I know I'm late but I think you should call it a little bit of everything
What is the song used in this vid?
This was so relaxing!
holistic taco
Happy birthday 🥳😊and I hope all of your dreams come true
I would totally buy simply extra 😂
Simply an extravaganza
For safiyas fans u get a Frankin nail polish
Do a clear peelie
Where can I get this nail oil pen
frankentaco
This is the births of most of the 2-year anniversary collection and I am here for it.
A Frankenstein nail polish color when you mix all the nail polish you mixed
omg i so badly wish i could just get all the holo taco’s at once
Ok three words “science queen collection” made from all these polishes
So amazing to hear Cristine sing a version of pity party
holo night should be the name of the polish
The unicorn/halo clear base combo should be an actual polish I would buy ittt
we need black holo witch
I NEED SIMPLY EXTRA NAIL POLISH
Petition for Cristine making this video again after Holo Taco growth 🙋‍♀️
OOOOO I would call it grape jelly!
Simply extra or simply spooky/Halloween holo
Is that a halo trashcan I see
Plum crypto
The Halo Tacos
Those look like the same exact polishes in the 2nd Anniversary Holo Taco Collection 😧😧😧😧😧😧😮😮😮😮😮🤔
𝒕he first one kinda looks like duct tape grey🤔
I would call it "Holo tea"
i think holo extra
Ik I’m late but i think it should be halo world
Simply Extra
Midnight ice 🧊
mixing all your overnight oats
She definitely needs to recreate this video now 😭
I'm rewatching a year later but..... hALLo taco should be the name!!
Spooky purple
Simply to much
The birth of Everything Taco!
She should combine ALL her nail polishes together!!!
Grape escape
I think it should be Called the Pelee bag
Beautiful!
mix all base coats ancd top coats
If this doesn't turn out black... I am going to be extremely confused. THOUGH! we have all the glitter colours, so I suppose it will be black with every colour of glitter ever, leaning towards whatever glitter colour is used the most, or stands out the most. Edit: Oh, purple. Well that's interesting. Also purple for the 500 mix...
"Dark Galaxica" I'd buy it :)
I had done this back in middle school (except I only had like 7 nail polishes) and the color I got was actually a sparkly olive green. My mom at the time had only let me buy nail polish from the dollar store so when she saw my nails after I had painted them with all my polishes mixed together, she thought that I had either gotten extremely lucky for finding that color at the dollar store or that the nail polish was gifted to me
I'm sure someone has already said this, but I haven't seen it so Everything But The Bagel Taco!
She should make a shade out of this and call it my soul
purple no matter what
HOLO More
I think it shoukd be called "simply birth-a-gical"
“The Kitchen Sink” and w/o crèmes, “Chrome Kitchen Sink”
hella late as well butden should be "orgy party"
Im extremely late but I was thinking "Extra Terrestrial" becuase it is very extra.
Call it 'Holo Taco Supreme'
to much to handle.
the mixing is soooo satisfying :')
Maybe... "all o' HOLO"
I’m kinda late but “simply curious”
Nix ur teas or Menuhin and zyler hair
It should be called birthday remix
Holo (and unicorn skin) explosion
simply holo
I think it should be called  "Beautified Blackberry"
but like i want these colors now
can she pls release the result of the third one in a bottle omg. it looked so good when she stacked all of them on her nails and the pink with holo looked so good
Franken taco
I love these type of vids
I am a bit late but I WANT THIS COLOURRRRRRR
This should be a yearly birthday tradition with all of that years polishes!  Like if you agree
Please make these all into official shades! (also whatever comes of mixing the newer collections)
Party on a nail
“Hey Christian, it only took four shades to make grey.”   Ngl I didn’t catch on to that for a good ten minutes but once I did, I laughed like a maniac 😂
I’m a holo in a bottle gotta paint me the right way
Halo bottle or halo in the room
I’m late but (taking from safias vids) name idea: Berry me in holo  Berry referencing to the berryish shade that went into it and ofc all the holo
Or the remix
Holo taco remix
The holo taco remix
This is the one ...all of my pride in one
So purple is the dominant color of holo, so basically Cristine’s favorite color is purple
frankenpolish
No one: Literally no one: After spending some time with safiya :
We have the same birthday
Second coat? More like second cardigan
I love how the creme mixture is literally just Duct Tape Grey- But i love it
Corrin will love this
I suggest a holo taco mountain would be fun
Do the Holo Taco polishes come with the cat hair, or do you have to add your own?
An update may be needed...
I would call it the Concoction Taco 😊
even if This Was like years ago ima say the name should be "Simply Cristine"
Can we PLEASE do some franken nail polish sets? these are GORGEOUS
i know it’s a year later but, hALLo tacos.
I I literally have those same sequence pillows
Name suggestion Berry extra because its a blue berry color
Fun name idea “goth-o-graphic”
You should name it   Everything all at once
she should mix all of the hair dyes she can find, she will finaly have some of her personality shown at first glance... unless it turns into a gross color or a natural color
It should be called "Whaddya think?"
We need an updated version with the new products 🥺
Holo on X games mode
You should name it holo taco extreme
And this is where the idea of the 2021 anniversary collection was made
4:42 I'd totally buy this if it were a shade actually...  As for the big holo mix-in that's sealed in a bottle I'd probably call it the Thanos Snap because it's purple + full of cosmic dust lol. No lie a lot of them looked like nebulas or galaxy patterned when the stirring started
What song is playing in the back when she mixes the nail polishes!!
I know this video is old but you could call it Alo Taco (all-o-taco) I thought of this at 02:00 :)
All-o taco!!!
name it SIMPLY HOLO-FULL
Parcloal
Should call it “not surprised it’s purple”
All about Holo is a good name
I think you should name it      Concoction
please do this again with the polishes you have now at holotaco
I think the name should be mysterious extra
I have a name for that ❤︎All in one❤︎ ☻︎
When did she get this calm like I'm not saying I don't like it but when did this happpen
The end result i thought of a dark holo purple or a dark black/grey/gray holo colour/color
All toco
Halalpalca
I think why mixing them, making it purple, is because there is generally more magenta (on the red side) and blue pigments. Blue actually has the magenta pigment (the true primary colour) and same goes for red. Most dark colours use blue pigments to create the dark colour. As a result, you get to lean more onto purple.
You should call it haloween
Happy birthday
You should do an updated version of this considering you have launched a lot of other polish since this was made
We need an update since you have more now 😛
You should call it hologothic
EYYY
Before watching the video. It will be hOoOlOoO
Holo gone wild!!!  Should be the name of the finished polish
Happy birthday christine🎉🥳🍾🎁🎈🎊🎉🥳🎁🎈🎊🎉🥳🍾🎁🎈🎊👯‍♀️
The purple color you got from all of your holos? (Not the holo-tacos) sould be made into a nail polish and be called "all the holo's!" After what you said when you mixed all of your general holo polishes 4 years ago!
All the holos in one
Simply holo
The fourth group mixed together looks like Taylor’s swifts wonderstruck perfume bottle 🤩
😂😂😂😂
Happy b-day
A glittery purple with a whole bunch of glitter and a dark purple base or a brown base. With glitter .      Edit: I was right
it needs to be called berry me in holo
it could be called glitter mix
Happy one year late birthday
Mixing all Sampo and condishinr
"Simply Science" 2020 edition  You should release one of these yearly on the anneversary of Holo Taco as a continuing documentation of how the brand grows and changes.
It Should be called elegant Perry
Mix all of your teas together
I love menchie
Calling for an update on this video!! Or continuation?
"Wow I actually wanna make a shade like this now" 👀 Well, it happened, and it's beautiful 😭😍. So glad I got my paws on some 🥰
Taco universe supreme is my suggestion 😂
A mini spatula would have been a good tool to stir and empty the polishes. Getting every last drop. No wasted Holo
Name it galaxy holo
A name i would give it would be “Holo Party” since it was your bday. I like that
a year late but "Midnight mysteries" ??
We need an updated version!!
call it ‘the world’ like the tarot card 🥺
Can this be a yearly thing?
I think it shouldve been called a Galaxy Taco, kinda reminds me of when i was a kid walking the beach on vacation with my dad at night and looking up at the sky. Instead of those flatter colors i think you shouldve added more birthday cake :)
Omg it’s simply nygaard
11:26 Is that a Holo Taco nail oil pen???
the final colour is giving outer space. call it galaxy.
03:57-04:19? i know an adult movie scene when i see one.
What about simply mixed
You can call this shade purple-hole....
That looks like a dark purple that corrine from threadbanger would wear :)
Mixing your oats
"All the goodness"
She should do this again, she's released so many more collections!
All of the above
Hmm inspiration for my bonus track...
I'm late to naming this thing but I thought if "Glitter, sparkle and everything Holo taco!  I haven't read the comments so Idk what everyone else's names are but-
Happy birthday!🎂🎉🎁🎈
You can measure by weight love!! Like how people measure their coffee beans or chemicals in a chem lab. Just use a small scale, zero out the empty beaker, and measure by grams. No waste!
All of the groups should be a new color of their own, and alongside the final product, *maybe there could be a new collection idea*
everything holo
Dusky night (I’m not sure dusky’s a word but it just fits
Purple is the superior color 💜
these need to be souled on ur website like NOW
mix mix
Call it everything juice
3:33 thats conk creat babey!!!!
Protein powders don’t do anything and are a waste of money
I know I’m even later but this soooo needs to be called multi taco
We share a birthday 💅
Everything is purple... Good thing I like purple!
I'd call this 33 and counting
you could have used a scale and added a gram of each other something
Mixing all of your nail polish together
You’ve got to make an updated one!!
“It’s my party I peel if I want to”
You should call it Safiya
How about unicorn mud🦄😁
The first 4 made a pretty shade I would wear under a holo toco
watching this after the remix collection dropped is so fun
I would kill for a holo taco noir collection. Like a black based collection with a red holo, green, blue, purple, green/blue iridescent.
You’ve been hanging out with Safiya wayyyyy too much. She is influencing your science 😂 we all love it tho lmao
9:24 rainbow holos, purple. Holo glitters, purple. Remix collection, purple.
How can she deal with nail polish when nail polish smells  She's special!?
So bazar to watch this now and know she based the 2nd anniversary collection on this video.
"Simply space"
IM A LIBRA TOO
Someone here after the release of "Two years anniversary Mixtape Collection" ? TACO EVERYTHING
ok but literally not even lying i would buy each of the shades from the small mixes
"New REMIX edition, unreleased, Holo Taco, tHaT wiLl NeVer Be rELeaSeD." 🤭
11:05 teaser for second anniversary remix collection.
7:05 Spoiler for second anniversary collection
If this wasn’t ASMR then Idk wat is
I think maybe “taco everyday” would be a good name
Me just casually singing(screaming) "IMA HOLO IN A BOTTLE BABEH" don't come at me plz. 😗🦖💿
"Never be released" Hahaha. Ha ha ha HAHAHAHAHAHA.
It's Holo Taco Salad!
You should call it galaxy holo
I feel like this channel has become a “me time” spin off...and I am HERE FOR IT! 😆😆😆
Me at time 0:00 : it think it will make a holo berry shade, like the other times you mixed your nail polish together. And that time safiya melter all her lipsticks. And the time you and her went to Orly and mixed them all together.
"deathday" (it kind of looks the oposite of the birthday polish), "(de)saturated", "universal", "universe shadow", "rainbow shadow", "soul"
Berrrrrrrrrrrrry Blackkkkkkkkkkkkk
I think it should be called ,, scattered galaxy holo”
And..nine months (2021) later she releases the Remix Collection.
Wonder if she tried making 'Simply Extra' for the Remix collection.
simply we're 3 days apart! 14TH OCT 2006 and You're 17TH OCT 1988 YEEHHEEEEE
So this is the video that started it all :D
Who’s back here after the second anniversary remix? 😍
This is real today 💿
Who came here to rewatch after the Remix Launch? 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♀️
"I actually wanna make a shade like this now" Christine just casually foreshadowing to the second anniversary release
OK.... since the launch happened for the REMIX collection, I revisited this video :) That eggplant purple was truly speaking to Cristine XD I am still sad, that I couldn't get the got cake polish, that is the only one i am missing.... T.T GJ for the HT team and GJ for Cristine for everything holo taco does, it upped my nailpainting game much :D PS: pretty please, make an other batch out of Got Cake? Thats literally the only thing I dont have from HT XD Even in a regular black box, i dont mind :P Thx Christine for literally just existing and making these pretty polishes, and thanks for making me each launch shouting shup up and take my money :)
Simply did say she starts her nail polish projects months in advance. 👀
POV: you’re here after the remix release
I see some colors that look mighty familiar 👀
Anyone else re-watching on 7/30/21 trying to figure out what the 2nd Anniversary mixes will be tomorrow?
Rewatching before Remix!
Holo Taco remix that will never release.  *rolls eyes towards second anniversary collection* sure simply
anyone watching this video before the 2nd anniversary collection is dropped to have some ideas?!?
Ah, yes, watching her channel randomly every few months
“Holo-vit at once”
Mmmmm gonna rewatch this expecting the best for our two year anniversary!!!
This is gonna be the anniversary colour! 😏 #2021
anyone else rewatching right before holo tacos 2 year anniversary collection?
9 months later and cristine has that black color in her electric holo collection
You should do this again since you have more nail polish
watching this to see what we could be expecting for the new 2nd anniversary release 👀👀👀
Well holo to people guessing what the anniversary collection might look like :3
The name of the holo taco,should be  Simply mixing
Who else is watching this in anticipation of the 2nd anniversary collection?
Simp,y Taco
That "hey Christian it only took 4 shades to make this grey" killed me... 😂😂
Got cake certainly was a great polish in its time 🎂
hi, I think the color should be named combo toco
Allholo??
So who's here before the second anniversary dropped to remind yourself what the mix looks like?
I think the shade should be called holo purple
I think the shade should be “Sanctuary dust” or “ midnight holo” UwU✨✌🏻🖤💓
Did any one else here a tv shiver thing?
look Amazing and beautiful🤩🤩
im really late but the name could be "A bit of everything" or "all-flavoured cake"
im like 10000% late but its  my birthday too when im watching
I think she should name it dusty storm
Cristine is a ✨32 year-old lady✨  Like if you get the reference.
I know I'm late but " Everything Bagel"
She reminds me of Doc Oc from into the Spider-verse
I think you should name it every holo
I think it should be the Franken taco
You should call it “remix”💿🌮
It can be named as 'Halloween party'
You could also put it on a kitchen scale and pour one gram (or however much you want) of each polish
I think it should be called,IT IS THE HOLLO TOCO!!!!!
It kind of looks like a galaxy. She could name it simply galaxy. Or even moon dust
Please tell me you're releasing these mixed shades, they're stunning
You should call it galaxy girl
It should be “witchcraft”
Instead of "all of the holo tacos in a bottle" you can say "Simply Everything💅"
The polish should be called “simplys extra birthday surprise “
I’m late to the party but this reminds me of the milky way, and should 100% be a limited edition release.
It should be named ‘simply everything’
It could be called simply everything
Simply spooky I think that should be the color name
I have the same birthday as Christine
She is 32!!!!!!!  I thought she was at least 24
Mixing all the fake holo you have together too see how bullshit it turns out. Just a mix of pure evil and deception.
Night Sky
I know I'm late to the party, but you should call it "Taco Supreme"
5:12                     haha nice
Super late to comment but my suggestion, since you are using all the tacos, is to call it The Whole Enchilada. lol
I think it should be simply taco
Name it simply everything
"Galaxies Edge"
Know I am really late (and have not yet read the comments to see if this has been said)…..All-O Taco. Or All-O Holo.
you should do this again but use the end results like an acrylic paint pour for art
Id love to see every colour from each line being mixed.  for instance, mix all 7 pastel rainbows together.  all your holo's, or everything in your unicorn dream line.
We need a 2021 update on this!!
3:34 and that's how people duct tape grey was born 😂😂
Simply holo will be great right
Okay but can we get the All The Toppers as an actual Holo Taco polish? Bc... Wooow 😍😍🤤
Just call it “simply indecisive”
That berry shade needs to be made available! 😍
I think the name is holo gon wild
Safiya needs to do a video where she chooses her favorite nail polishes from you and mixes them and then you would have to make it an actual color for all of us to be happy.

Should be called ‘Not simply Taco but very Taco’
“What do you get when you mix colors that is more than one color” Brown.
Hey miss lady simply naillogical mam i want all your nail polishes are these avabile in pakistan??
I think the shade should be called  “Holo Sandwich”
The Extreme HoloTaco
I can imagine people who’ve never seen or heard of Christine before and just seeing the intro and immediately clicking off😭
The name could be bottle sparkle.
Galaxy Holo
We should name it:  🌮✨THE ULTIMATE TACO✨🌮
Holo heaven as a name
Holo heaven as a name
It’s Cristine singing pity party her version that I love.
PITY PARTY
I think it should be called  dust berry
Safia could mix her glosses, primers, powders (that would be fun cause she's gotta crush em all up) probably all her contours and bronzers and blushes in one, mixing all hair dye colors
So I'm pretty sure you already know this but the reason why when you mix your nail polishes together and they come out more purple has to do with the primary colors (Red,Blue,Yellow). Most of your nail polishes are mixed with more red and blue than yellow and those show through more, it also has to do with the fact red and blue is a lot more bold and darker than yellow so they do take over.
Am I the only one that thought “she’s pulling a Saphia” (side note it’s been a while so idk if I spelled saphia right haha)
The hollow party the hollow party
Happy birthdayHappy birthday
DUDE I HAVE A NAME: VERY BERRY XTRA!!!

Omi you should make a collection- thats all the subgroup mixes in this video!!! :33 Ngl After seeing it on black I REALLLY want the result from the unicorn skin one 😍😍😍😍
Wish I saw this video ewrlier, I would have gotten it TwT
This is one of the most gorgeous video's I've ever seen.
Nyx's kiss as a name offer
I think it will be a dark purp/black/dark dark blue
I know I’m late but “all in one “
Anybody else loving this color and want it? 🙋🏻‍♀️😫
Th franken taco or holo
"call me universe"
sorry if i wrote ur name wrong
HAPPY B DAY CHRISTENE
Death's smile,holo's shadow
She should release a collection like this
it reminds me of the galaxy.
You should mix all 2,000 of your nail polishes
Happy belated birthday,  And there should definitely be a Mega-corn with all the unicorn polishes mixed
8:30 I disagree. I wait hours it seems
The red halo glitter (sorry if I got it wrong TwT) I think it pretty attractive very pretty! :)
Turn to Jesus and be saved
She should put the toppers in a bottle and call it everything but the créme
Looks like the galaxy kind of
Before vid: Ima guess the end color is like a blueish purple After vid: nope purple as always
Mixing every single polish she owns together even the chonky ones
You could make a polish and call it *_The everything polish_*
That low fi almost put me to sleep
How could she do all of these process very clearly
Moon blue
My name submission is "Simply re-mixed"
Simpl Holo
Universal Plum.
Mystical Plum.
it should be called all for one and one for all... idk that was random
Would be awesome for an update on this with all the new nail polishes that came out.....
Ironically, this looks exactly like a nail polish Safiya would wear
7:26
Imagine buying all the polishes just to mix them together. Thatd be a really expensive polish
I like it cause it looks a bit like the inside of a dark geode.
Do you hate gel polish?
Have Absolutely No Idea How I Missed This Video!? 🙃😞😒. YOW To the world 🌎!
please tell me this ism available!!! This is my dream shade
You should call it .                   Name : got it all
Mixing every condiment on the supermarket shelf and eat it with fries.
My name idea is 'Twilit Sky'
You should do a collab of whatever its called where you and Safia make this product like all the seprate mixures and the final mixture because nail polish and holo is your thing and mixing stuff is Safias
it should be called holy taco
Who’s watching this now and still saying happy birthday, in your head.
Yes they are here thanks you for your  time
i think the shade should be my b day
Safiya should mix all HER nail polish together 👍
i think you shojld call it “plum surprise” or “purple fantasy” :D
i'm late but the name could be "all o' the holo"
Costum polich for Sophia 😂
It should be called “holo-everyone”
How about "marbary perr"
I’d call it Chemist Chaos (After Hours)
Cosmetic
0:22 Cristine editing: Cris 😑 Cris 😑 Cris 😑Cris 😑
I dont know about a name but on the back it could say  "Cant decide which Holo Taco polish to choose? It's not a problem anymore" Btw I know I'm 5 months late Dont judge me
I tink it should be called haloeen
Am I the only (a little triggered) scientist here?😂
im very late but call this... party bag!
Ok but I am BEGGING for a collection of the mixes
I'd call it the "night spirit" Cos the color range is deep purple-violet indigo and if you've ever looked at a starry night sky, you'd see the stars, different sizes and shifting colors. This. Polish reminded me of the night sky and hence "night spirit"  What do you think? 😅
I think the name sounds be 33 shades of holo
muted galaxy or dusty galaxy
I I think it should be “my tacos”
Happy birthday
Spooky remix
reminds me when you wash a color load in the dryer, and the lint is this purpley color.
The holo glitter one? The one that's purple lol. The color reminds me of chicha morada (a drink from Perú) and I really like it, I would like that lol
Is the creme one what inspired Duck Tape Gray?
I want to see all her nail polish 💅 like and copy an paste if you agree
She says 'Woooooow' like I do!!!
galaxy madness is a good name
I'd wear it.
Wondering if this is where the idea for Duct Tape Gray came from?
Cosmic holo
am i the only one that wonders if this is how she makes her intro
The pansexual flag at 5:12
I wanna say that when you mix separately and then add them together (witch she did) there would be a different colour if she mix them all at the same time no separation
Happy birt
As someone who has tried it before, I cannot advise that you mix hair dyes.
You need to sell the unicorn skin mix that’s beautiful
My son suggested "space dust"
Does anybody else really want that blue creme mix?
It's purple because the pigments we use to produce red and blue colours are more concentrated than the yellow ones - which tend to be quite dilute-able to still show up on their own but then that means there's less pigment compared to red and blue products which usually come in much more varying levels of intense-ness! If you added more yellow or orange to the mix you'd start to get brown or you could add green-yellow to get a more black colour :D
Everything Taco! Kinda like everything bagel.
I would love the name simply everything
It’s called Zombie Taco
i want the mixed topper soooo bad
Do Taco polish mountain 🌮
TACO PARTY
I kinda own that color.
Okay but hear me out... Black holo polish Like how fucking good would that be

Simply remixed polish
"midnight menchie"
This is giving me major galaxy vibes
I called the end color "All-o  Taco" in my head just now, seems appropriate lol.
This would look good on safia
Simply Holo ween It's a good Halloween nail polish
9:52 Am I the only one that spotted the loose mising ball? XD

Simply Galaxy

Holo in a bottle its all her wishes in a bottle
11:33 MELANIE MARTINEZ
Extra (rainbow) eggplant
Mixing all the dye in DRUGS STORE wait is it called drugs store nag I don't care mixing DYE!!!

Waiting for Simply Extra
You could call it the everything taco kinda like the everything bagel
Holo Galaxy💿🌌❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"actually i might do that one because i am disgusting"
Holo Taco Buffet
I think the nail polish should be called Dusty Midnight Purple.
My birthday is on October the 16th no wonder you are one of the greatest people alive 🙃
I like "blackberry blast" for the colour but I'm sure whatever is picked will be rad
Do you get sick of the nail polish smell?? Just curious lol
She should mix again with her new polishes
3:05 NAZAR
north star nailpolish name
Simply Extra
I would have called the last one ‘space party’ ‘space pop’
Yo bring back got cake this year
I wouldve called it Taco with the lot
you need to go to polish mountain using only holo taco nail polishes now 😊
I wish I had the money to buy all of them, they are all so pretty and I would actually do my nails ALL THE TIME!! lol Thank you for the fun video though. :3 happy birthday 🎂🥳
I would call it "Wicked Purple"
Would you ever release a gel polish line? Im a nail tech but i highly preffer gel polishes!
Late comment, but the reason these mixes almost always turn out purple is being red and blue pigments are typically stronger than yellows, so even though there are yellow pigments going in (with the orange, yellow, and green) the reds and blues overtake those tones and what you end up with is purple with a bit of yellow that tones down the saturation of the color.
Name can be dusty galaxy 🌌
Simply Ice Purple
She's only doing this because she doesn't wanna mix every single one in her collection.
Ummmm I would buy this!! Legit
I see more blue than purple
The franken polish is what saf would call it
Maybe Halo-Mania
Spooky taco
It should be named galaxy taco
call it ,,simply mix"
"amalgamation"?
Call it multi-taco
Mixing just the primary colors = cyan
Not me asking for these for every holiday
Aaaaa she sang a melanie martinez song!!!
i think it shud be something like holo centric
Dusty Galaxy or I simply can’t decide
Everything holo like Everything Bagel
Rainbow taco
ur birthday is 4 days after mine but im 11yrs
Holo madness

9:51 - Who else wants a water marble technique with these? <3<3<3
midnight sky
Mix all of your cremé nail polishes together for a custom mix
Okay but that icy blue shift is awesome.
Midnight mixture would be a cool name i think
Is an answer to why do this why not if you like it who cares what anybody else has to say as long as it's legal of course
" bury me in polish " like Sofia's " bury me in lipstick " it's a great name i think
Name it chaostastic holo polish
I like the name Lost In the Galaxy
I think it should be named lunar eclipse
Cris:But there’s only one way to figure that out- YouTube premium ad plays Me:DO I REALLY NEED TO GET YOUTUBE PREMIUM TO SEE THE REST?!?! My mum:wth?

Spooky nook punch
Simply Cristine
MIX YOUR OVERNIGHT OATS
The fact that she posted this on her birthday and I’m watching it on my birthday!
Can we just talk about how calming it was to watch and listen to the mixing of the nail polishes?
Flashy soul
The shade HAS to be called simply extra 😦😯
She shouldn’t have said time to get mixing instead: it’s time to get my taco on
Star Dust. Just call it Star Dust.

purple
“Holo taco in a bottle taco” would be cute!
Simply Work and Passion? Cuz it's the purple you guessed plus the joke
Happy birthday
Call it allo holo
I would love a Frankenstein collection. I know there are complications with mixing all the actual polishes for a factory production but making polishes from scratch that will look similar to the mixes would still be really cool.
Cristines next video: new nail polish coming out called 33 shades of holo
I think all the mix should be call Black Galaxy Holo Taco 💟
Name could be simply supreme eheh
simply remix or holo remix
THIS IS SOMETHING SAFIYA WUD DO... FRANKENPOLISH...
A cool name for it I think is the whole menu

Maybe you can called it ''All in''.
I think you should name the shade: not so berry burst

All the holo could be the name of the polish maybe
Spooky Season
Mixing all your holo tacos together
nail polish name: cosmic wave
All Holo’s Eve

The yielding channel neurobiologically yell because spike respectively file excluding a symptomatic feature. yummy, jaded toad

Mix all your oats!!!!!
I vouch for the name "mad science"
i know i’m late but this polish 100% needs to be called ‘i simply can’t decide’
How about, Holo-taco wrap... 🤷🏻‍♀️
The name should be “33 polishes, 1 bottle”
Mixing all the holo taco base coat lol
Aww man. I wished you had applied & topped the premix mixed colors to each nail before the big mix mix at the end. So pretty! End result name? the HOLO COMBO TACO SUPREME! Duh.

Simply extra
The damaged father similarly disappear because taurus paradoxically ban against a melted dinosaur. piquant, flawless stinger

Total Taco
you should’ve done your birthday nail polish as an accent nail cause it’s your bday! i also wanna see how it’d look on nails lol

Her:everything you mix is purple  Me:almost falling asleep  Her:business and money purple  Me:what what!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

I’m tink is Blue dark
Kinda look like sparkly asphalt😅
I liked just calling it "Remix"
This is the most calmest video Cristine ever made I can’t remember the last time you didn’t cuss in your videos
youtube is suggesting "water marble nails" on the app and i feel like it's tempting cristine
"Cat lady" taco
11:27 Melanie Martinez! YASSS!
I love the gray that the cremes made. Maybe it should be your next creme color.
I’m so sad simply. I love all of your holo tacos but I unfortunately can not afford to buy any but I really love your YouTube stuff and your videos always make me feel happy and laugh
Is it just me or is simply maturiting
It should be named Holo Taco Coktail
This is the most satisfying thing i've ever seen
YOUTUBE VIDEO IDEA: because cannabis is legal in Canadá try doing your nails stoned😭😭😭that would be soooo funny
The name should be the dark knight
Happy birthday i LOVE you tingas
A Winter moon
pOliSh MoUntEn.... ❤
Call it “The Purple of Life” lol
All the hollow tacos not in one bottle
Holo in one
I think the shade should be twilight space
Why dont u do a paint pouring picture with nail polish.
So the reason that you see purple often when you make so much colors together is because our eyes and our brain don’t know what to do when they see the color purple purple ‘s actually “imaginary” it’s our brains natural way of responding because we physically don’t know what to Think when we see that colors or brains have doubled it purple. It makes more sense if you’re looking at the color spectrum it’s a line going from red down to blue and purple comes after blue but purple is really a mixture of red and blue but I brains don’t really know how to handle that hence the color purple
I havnt watched you in idk how long. I missed you.
Holo taco overload
you should name it holo remix
I think shade name should be  *I PURPLE U*
this video was honestly the most relaxing video on your channel lmao
Extremely disappointed she didn't use the opportunity to say "enough talk, more taco" at 2:42.
I have the same Starbucks cup as Cristine and I am thrilled
Holo All Night
Happy birthday!!!!!!🎉
@8:21 I like that  “Blue ain’t slick”that would be a dope ass name for that one of u decide to bottle it 💙
32?? 😳 you don’t look a day over 23
You should call it simply too much or gothic bedroom wall lol I like the first one the best!
SAFIA SHOULD MIX ALL THE PERFUMES IN BATH AND BODYWORKS
happy late birthdayyyyy
I think "Holo Wishes" would be pretty cool for name. Idk maybe it's just me :b. Welp, bye-
You should mix all of the tea you have
For some reason I think a name as Dusty Galaxy
I think a good name for the final mixture would be galaxy dust maybe
then this concoction explodes and leave a trail of rainbow to the pot of gold
I love how nerdy she looks in the glasses to me :>
Name idea  Franken-taco
Blueberry Misty?
Can we just admire the amazing choice of Lofi music?
One drop of every single polish on your shelf, even if there are duplicates.
Simplys best is what you should name it

Twilightaco or Twilight Taco -name
You should make the mixes official colours 😁😁😁
i love the music during the montages😌
ok but the rainbow mix and the topper mix were amazing and i would buy those
Wow I LOVED the toppers and everything mixes! You should release a duo of the two for like, Christmas or New Years called “Simply Extra” and “Simply Space” or something :D
i think it should be "all the holo on my taco" .w.
Dusty Rouge
Grape soda

Reminds me of watermarbling
Name suggestion, “Holograil” :D
You are as old as philza minecraft

The Polish should be called, “the mix wix”
you should mix all of your nail polishes
I think the name should be " Burthday-suit" hehe
How about "allo tacos". I'll go home now  😂
You could use a scale Edit: looks like you use about 5 grams for each
Happy birthday!!!!

CRISTINE IS A LIBRA LIKE ME, IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW

You should paint each nail with the mixes of the subgroup colors and final color
Name the shade after Safiya
galaxy polish,,,
Make it Holo taco Supreme 🤩🤩

My son says you could mix the subway sandwiches.
Definitely mix all your protein powders!
Happy late birthday christen (sorry if I spelled that wrong)😁😊🥰
It should be called “holo at your girl”
Omg I was born October 18th 2006
MIX HAIR COLOUR AND DYE YOUR HAIR SOFUAAAA!
Happy birthday
Call it extra taco
Happy Birthday!!! Or late birthday, I guess Anyways, Cristine do be sounding like a scientist lol
i think it will be like a dark bule/purple with a little holo
Happy birthday
Dark crystal
Imagine taking one of every nail polishes she has and painting a desk or like an accent wall with one small stroke of each polish. Then every time she gets a new one, she can add it to the collage until it is complete..
Can you give article from : phillipines
You should make this a color and name it The Galaxy
Watching this makes me crave a nail polish acrylic pour!
It's 100% Safiya Nygard
the nails after i love it
YOU SHOULD COME OUT WITH THAT SHADE
Ooooh I really like that purple with multi glitter.
Am I the only one who wants her to mix EVERY one of her nail polishing that she owns behind her
i got a name for al the taco colours it is mixed taco
She did not show us the pell 😫
Play ... among us....next video
one with the holo
its kinda like a holo galaxy
It would be so awesome if you could bring back all the boxes. I’d buy them all! I want to collect your polishes but they sell out SOOOOO FAST. I want to collect your boxes too
Name should be"Holo explosion"
Since she's 32 when will BEYNNN propose?
that ring light reflection tho
hi, could you caption your videos please? I'm chronically ill and the pain makes it hard to focus on sound only 😔
That's definitely a galaxy shade if I've ever seen one (about the final mixture)
I think it should be called “Dusty Berry.”
I’m watching this during a sleepless night and you have no idea how much this calmed me down.  The music in combination with the mixing and the sparkling is better than any asmr or audiobook (at least for me)!  Thank you so much ❤️
The unicorn skins remind me of confetti 6:00 and all the nail polishes mixed together look like a galaxy 10:19
DID ANYBODY ELSE NOTICE THE HOLO TACO NAIL OIL PEN!!!! Edit : I’m so glad she listens to Melanie Martinez!!!!
Still waiting on that Black Holo tho! 😂
You should mix a base coat a plan color a holo and a top coat together
safiya can mix all the.. nevermind, can't think of anything else
olly the holly, name it that and every single subscriber will buy it hehehe, and a hair in it ofc
Call it “taco with the works” lol
This makes me happy and calms me :)
OMG I have that same Starbucks holo cup! 😂😂😂
Mixing hair dye could be interesting
It should be a holooooooooooooooooo
Make a nail polish mountain using all the nail polish in your own brand
I should be studying for my exam, but instead, I am here because this is more entertaining and far more educational!
Could this possibly be the next experiment for Cristine the science queen? https://youtu.be/k098nwH4gRg
Call it cosmic holo
It should be named hot topic because that’s the store reminds me of for some reason
Midnight Sleet
my hypothesis: I think it's going to be a muddy brownish blue and a hint of pink and alot of holo because in her seires of holo nail polish, she has bright blues in mostly every one of her collection and as we all know that if we mix every "rainbow" colour, we get a very disgusting brown; and considering that she has like atleast like one pink in her collocations, I think a hint pink might come through and make a mess. Also I think there is going to be alot of holo but it's going to be very confusing as what the nail polish is trying to seem, because of all the holo it might make it a bit more *sparkly* so my final thought is that the nail polish going to be a muddy bronish colour with some blue and pink, and a confusing amount of holo.
You need to do it again you have 5 more now
The name should be: “THE holo taco”
It should be taco in a bottle
The frankin-taco
I think she is forget her channel 's password lol
never thought I would live to see the day when Cristine makes a parody of 'pity party' by Melanie Martinez
I just realized the colored 'toppers' make the pan flag
omg why there isn't "BEANNNN" nail polish
I think the name should be Midnight In Holo.
Why wasn't "taco party" the first choice?
Please
TRY PRESS ON NAILSSS
You should call it "witch's brew"
No no peel pawn WHY NOT !!!!!!!! 💅💅💅
WAIT. She needs to stack on a bunch of holo taco polishes. SHE MUST RETURN TO POLISH MOUNTAIN!!!
So I have a question I follow you on Snapchat do you respond to comments on your stories
The mysterious Ness
Super holo taco
I love how successful your brand has been but i have to admit i do miss your regular videos. You have such a great YouTube persona c:
I feel like she should make another collection with all of other collection mixed together
why do Canadians spell colors wrongs 😂
Holo-Mania?
Cristine: comment a better name then all of the  holo tacos in one bottle   Me: EXTRA TACO
Cristine: only one way to find out  *target add plays*   Me: go to target
Name:  shake taco
I'm late sorry but happy bday Christine !!

Hi

Why does she sound kinda sad
Her nose must be dying

are these normal nail polish or are these gel?
simply-multi crome me-look at that muliti cromey s*** im shook
black ice?
can someone do a compilation of Cris laughing at her own jokes
Next time you should mix a whole bottle of each polish, and then sell the extra.
She should definitely release all of them in a collection😍😍
You should seriously release the unicorn topper mix as “Opal,” because it looks exactly like an opal.
I haven’t watched Cristine in a while but it kinda seems like she’s changed a lot- she isn’t as chaotic and crazy and happy as what she used to be when she’d mix things or do crazy experiments
My Birthday is Nov17
Call it halo eve and sell it pizzazz for spooky seoson
Holos eve

You should name it "dusty Galaxy new year's Eve"

I know that this not related to nails but I just had a ad that had Nikkietutorials
Safia could do foundation? Or body butter
mixing perfume could be a possibility
You should do something with this https://youtu.be/6p3T_KHbfhs
Plum Perdy
You should mix all of your overnight oats
MIXING ALL OF YOUR OVERNIGHT OATS
I think it should be called a catastrophe in a bottle.
Wow 🤩
This was strangely soothing.... Very meditative watching the colors mix together... Also kind of reminded me of the guy on tiktok who guesses paint colors? https://youtu.be/1ivZFrk-yBU
The black holo remix
You have the same phone case as me!
I put lon* nails on before I watched this
You should mix all the oatmeal
I think you should nake it menchy hair in the lab:)
Mixing all the hair dyes of one brand name would be cool to do, you should do that Christine!      🙆❤💛💚💙💜💟💞
I think the end result was beautiful and I would love to have that color nail polish!          💙💅💜
The last mixture you made before mixing them all together was beautiful and that was my favorite one, even though I do like them all. Good job Christine!
Happy Birthday girl!
Christine the science Queen is Christine the Holo Queen
her birthday is a day before me
I need a matte polish in your next collection PLEASEEEEE
She def got more mature since the last time I watched her
CRISTINE THE SCIENCE KWEEN
the end result is like a really beautiful obsidian colour wow
HALP I JUST BROKE MY NAILL
The name should be:   Almost* completely random
Omg calling all the holos ;] I THINK AMAZEEE
The fact that I see more of a grey than a purple in the final polish (◔‿◔)
It’s should be. Everything At once
You should mix regular nail polish and top coats
It reminds me of galaxy so maybe it should be called “galaxy show”
Name for the new mixture : emo girl's secret recipe or your gbf's secret
A good name would be “simply out of this world” since it’s galaxy
Sparkly night? Special occasion?
It think it should be Wholo, since it conatins the whole selection of holo tacos :D
You should name it "SPACE" because it looks like GALAXY
It looks like a "Holo Galaxy" :D
Tbh she seems different than she used to 😿
I just feel like Holo Taco Supreme really fits lol
Franken-holo
Simply I found holo spray from splat  they have stellar and galaxy you should review it to see if its truly HOLO
I think "All Holo" is nice
Looks like space
Diamond Ring
"Frosted Soul"  .... Becuase you said it was dark like your soul 😂
Has anyone noticed that she went from not talking,not showing her face while doing nails to doing sh*t like this.
Cristine, you should definitely check out Ann Readon's recipe about chocolate that is ACTUALLY HOLO!! THATS RIGHT!! ACTUAL EDIBLE HOLO FOOD!! I M FREAKING OUT!!!!!  https://youtu.be/6p3T_KHbfhs

"midnight sky" maybe
or simply mixed for short
Petition for Cristine to actually make "Simply Extra"!!!
Girl i just realized we have the same birthday
Obviously it needs to be called,” everything but the nail polish”
you should call it 'supreme christene' i dont know why i just like it
i feel like cristine has gotten a little bit more robotic, doesn't feel as natural anymore
I think the name should be BEEYIN
you should call it frankentaco
Name it simply extra tacos
someone alert Safiya there is bad nail polish science happening here
I love your videos. I work from home now and don't go out much, like everyone else. It's been lonely. Watching your videos is like getting to spend time with a friend. Hope that doesn't sound creepy or presumptuous. I just mean watching your videos and podcasts gives me a good feeling, a good feeling I really need lately. :)
Hey Christine! Please check my tweets and my DM to the Holo taco Twitter my @ is @Destah98  I had my silver holo nail polish mess up, the silver holo in it like dissolved? I’m not sure what happened but it’s unusable :(( PLEASE BOTICE THIS
2020 Holo Mix
Shoutout to wengie when Cristine said 'icing on the cake' cause wengie has a song called cake in which one of the lyrics is 'I got the icing on the cake' so big shoutout but also.......happy holo-birthday to simply nailogical!!!
I think its should be called "extra holo my taco"❤️
My name suggestion  Cardigan of my co worker   Lol that was just for fun My ACTUAL name suggestio n  Icy galaxy
The true question: WiLl It Be PuRpLe?

"Quarantine Boredom"
You should release the mix of every one of the polishes!

Christine :who wanna drink out of this cup   Me being dumb af :mee it looks delicious
The Safiya Nygaard of Nails
Cristine: here we go        youtube: lets put an add here
Holo in a Taco 😍
“Simply Witchcraft” or “Purple shine”
Taco galaxy
the jeopardy theme song makes me sad now
It should be called "Holo All!"
Want this purple holo-glitters, the topper, the linear-holo and the ultimate shade you created !!! Would definitely buy them 😍😍😍 Mixing video is so satisfying. Could you make the same without the first 4 shades to see what happens pleeeeeease
Happy birthday
Video idea: recreate Starbucks drinks on your nails👀
Happybrithday

Simply Galaxy
Didn’t she do this before???
OOKY SPOOKY or OOPS, I SPOOPED IT AGAIN!

She literally took the night sky and painted it on her nails 🥰
Name this the Taco Supreme
Me watching while chewing on my nails:😮💅
name for the final nail polish product: Cristine's Concoction

mixing all your tacos!
Mixing all the oats together!
I still love mixing videos, something about them is just very pleasing to me.
The reflection on her glasses 👁‍🗨👁‍🗨
Mix all base coat
Where’s BeENNn
i think the nail polish should be called 2020 with holo
“Simply everything”
13:45 Why is there a picture of Patanjali shampoo 😅
I’m going to guess ....brown?
Simply's definitely changed, I kinda miss her silly humor, that was fun. But yet again there was a lot of negativity when it came to people calling her annoying. Idk if anyone noticed, but she's gotten more and more serious about her videos. I find that cool, but I like boring idk. Good luck tho Simply! Been a fan for four years, it's almost like every year you change it up, especially recently. Do what you do :3
It looks like a berry blast
GALAXY
Hi
Mixing all your overnight oats recipes together
kristine maybe one day you should make a pastel creme nail polish set?!
"All Holos eve" is a cute name
You should put in bottles the first results of all the mixtures
Name it midnighthalo
Mixing all your mixed things together

Can we just take a second to realize how far she’s gotten, like she has her own NAIL POLISH now
I actually want the purple lol
Franken-taco
How about: Purple 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑙 Shinin
"Holoday" should be the name
it should be called holo skys. x
Jasmines secret or genies bath house
"hollowfeast" "hollowbeast"
Gosh I haven't watched a Christine video in like 2 1/2 months. Usually I wait like 3 months and then I watched them in big bursts because I can't stand only having one Christine video look a week and then having to wait another week so I just force myself to wait like months and then just been to the mall and I can't believe I was 3 weeks late to this. People literally kills me I missed a mixing video but I guess I'm here now
Is no one gonna talk about the fifty shades of grey joke ?!
Ok but.. are you gonnna... make these real purchasable products cus id pay for em
It looks like the night sky without light pollution
Three weeks late but happy birthday Cristen
i think she should re create all the separate nail polishes and call the nail polish set " In the Mix"
Maybe the name can be like “mega taco”
Cristine is a literal anti-depresent
Galaxy
Cluster Taco?
Our birthdays r 2 days off lol
CRISTINEEEE DO A TRANS NAIL
Shoot it's so pretty and now I want it???
Dis is so cool
it should be named All-o Taco if it's not I'm rioting
Holo holo holo taco taco
Could’ve used a scale lol
"Mystic globe" that's my name idea
This is why she reorganized her nail polishes again. So she could find all of her HOLO TACO polishes 😂
the name could be Allo Taco  ....do not ask why....
“looks like my favorite shade of uninviting wall paint”
U should name it all my tacos :>
I have a holo backpack
I think it should be called "Menchie hair"

Happy birthday🎂🎉🎁
I remember watching u everyday! Im glad i found ur channel again lol :3
I think 'Sipmly One ' wouldn't be a bad name
Give away idea : u always has a lot mixing up nail polish so i suggest...  1.make a bottle design than only use for give away...make sure u number the bottle start from one to ten thousand or something...  2. Whenever u finish ur mixing video put it in the bottle u design for give away...  3. Send it to fan maybe make a contest or send it to superfan maybe???  4. Remember to send it to me the 1st one tho...😆😆😆(please include the sweater if u can)😋😋😋

Spooky taco should be it's name it's perfect
Mystic Holo
You should sell all the toppers mixed together as an individual topper because it looks stunning, and it’s really the prettiest thing for nails I’ve ever seen😍😍🤤🤤🤤 But really all the mini mixes should be made into a separate limited edition shade maybe🤔😍
Hey cristine, really important question about your holo taco nail polish. I really really hope you do see this but i was wonder why you dont ship to Western Australia, i was really looking forward to buying your nail polish but im unable to because i live in Western Australia. Please if you do see this by any chance id love to here from you. Love your page!!
what about  "hologalaxy"
You should go to polish mountain with just holo taco polish’s
Perfume? Sodas? Energy drinks ?
Congrats on 7,69 subs!
HOLO TACO MOUNTAIN  YASSSSS
everyone is saying different names in this comment section-
Omfg u didn’t know me and her are libras period
Taco shake
Wait wait wait.... SHE SHOULD CALL HER HATERS HALOPHOBIC’S!!!!!!!!!!!
Franken holo
I think it should be called “Holo Taco X-treme!”
Halo Taco Supreme I AM COMING FOR THE NAME GIG🤣
I would call it Constellation as it gives me a milky way/galaxy feel
Haloverse
why does it look like the homemade slime that the slime girl sold to you at recess in fourth grade O-O

Plum or plum taco plum sparkle holo plum
You definitely need to sell these blends
Bro I have a fimalur color of nail polish just a bit darker lol
I have not watched it yet but it’s either dark red brown purple or black/grey

All holos eve
Call it “Simply Soul”

What's a world without halo
Spooky halo   Could be a good name :)
Christine's birthday is 2 days before mine
Hey cristen it only took 4 shades to make this grey. I canttt the 50 shades of grey referance im dyinng 😂
Omg Cristine should be called Cristea get it no ok...
Wait where is her husband I am back after a year
Name it “simply not simple”
it should be called "I'm not surprised that it's - Purple"
It’s Been so shlong
if you name that “like my soul” it would be accurate because of all the holo you’ve inhaled and ate throughout your nail polish life 👁👄👁
Maybe, "Purple party punck" or, "All Holoween". Idk
5:15 really said pansexual pride 😍✨🏳️‍🌈
Mix together all of your overnight oats flavors!!!
*Christine wearing glasses* Me : I can't the reflection of the light bothers me so muchhh *Christine without glasses* Me : yayyy now I can watch without something bothering me  *Christine wearing glasses again* Me : 👁️👄👁️
call it Halloween Skies
christine doesn't even look 30 she look 27 BELOW  tho...
“The Holy Taco”
“Boo berry sparkle”
im watching this instead of doing my schoolwork
why did i find this satisfying?
Lol you should make it simply purple or simply snaz?
If it doesn’t end up being black I’ll be surprised.
Ohhhhhhh gurl I missed you I haven't watched you since 4 years now OOMMGG i I'll watch you everyday now love you and missed you so much
Simply satisfying
Ok hear me out, "Simply Birthed". Because you "birthed" the nail polish 😅
Happy birthday Christine 🥳🥳🥳🥳
"Whole-o Taco"
wait why is she celebrating her bday by herself?
“Galaxyallaterbai”
Pelly bag in a bottle is the name
Simply do 100 layers of holo taco
What about, mixing all of your peel-off bases that you have and see how they react to each other Btw, how about "Reunited" because it's created from your OG nail polishes that are separated before, and now they can be together forever. Or you could name it with "Together Forever", now that is actually sound so cool, but it's up to you after all
make a holo polish called dark rainbow with a bunch of your holo ones mixed together
Obvi, it should be called holo taco supreme
HAPPY BIRTHDAYYY! 🍵🎉🎃
I would call it Galaxy dirt
Holo spooky season
Needs to be called “celestial purple”. Great vid 🤘🤘🤘
Just make a simply extra holo taco collection with the resulting colors of your  experiment. That would be so cool
It looks kinda blackish and purplely so kind of midnight purple possibly 'midnight taco'?
Got cake should be in standard collection for sure!!! The best one tbh😍😍😍
Why did I found this video so relaxing 😂😊
I just got a 3 month old cat her names is Mochi like the ice cream from Japan but I also took Mechi sorry if I spelled it wrong I am typing really fast, faster then I thought I could type.
mix all your overnight oats together lmao
Nice content! 🔥 I You're similar to this channel ———> #_ebonyinterests 😃
"witches brew" would be a cool ass name
i feel like cristine just is that kind of ytber that u can watch and itll always make you feel better. she puts time into editing but doesnt overdue it to where ur annoyed and doesnt make insane unbelievable content she just does what she wants to and i love that dude. shes just a queen.
Simply space
Spooky holo Or spooky holo ft. Menchies' hair.
i just pulled the debit card out to buy it, and i saw that it was sold out :((((
Cristineeeee !!! Look at this youtube video. https://youtu.be/vIvdsqo_87o  maybe youll want one done of Menchie and Zyler.
You should try color street nails. I’m sure you would have many things to say about it
I haven't watched her videos in quite a while. Her spirit seems off. Maybe she doesn't have as much fun making videos as she used to.
You should call it "Simply Cauldron"
everything but the kitchen sink is what I would name that
Who is watching this painting ur nails with ur non dominant hand
I think the polish should be called hololulia
Kinda like a pick n mix vibe
Berry toco
The first and second 😻😻
Omg I hope you make all of those!! they’re actually so nice! Neeeeed
Simply Frankenstein shade
Cris, pls consider these mixing videos: Mix all your overnight oats flavors. Mix all your dry flakies and do some combo experiments. Mix all your dry glitters (organized by size s/m/l) and burnish or do ✨nail✨art✨ And pls include a statistical breakdown of your collection of flakes and glitters lol
Cristine I think u sould do a video were u let among us players choose your nail art
Just noticed the Holo Taco nail oil :)
Hii Simply, do you have a channel called Simply Catlogical, because there is such a channel on YouTube, is it your channel or is it a false channel, please confirm because you never mentioned it in one of your videos, so I don't want to subscribe to a fraud channel, please tell Simply 😘😘
Can I drink it
i like that name you said in the video simply extra
You should release it and call it “ultimate holo” or “ultimate tacos”
If you want to scare Ben this Halloween show him a picture of rotten bananas!🍌😏
Holo Franken-Galaxy.
It looks like the galaxy.
simply face logical would be os proud..... i had a nikitutorials ad before the video
Everytime this is done it’s always a burgundy-brown color
Ooohhh you should def mix drugstore hair dyes and apply 'em to your hair 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bretman the science b- b-
As a goth guy who routinely paints his nails, this color is really nice and would definitely be in rotation. It'd be a nice step between black and other shades of purple.
It should be spooky taco
I would call it 'Simply Perfect' or 'Simply Logical'
Could u review another children’s toy? there’s one called go glam Salon
Oooooo what if she made like a Collection of all the experimental shades.
It’s oils be hilarious if you tried asmr lol
Next time use those like food measuring scales to get specific values. Cuz you love that statistical data....  Honestly, I just wanna see you excited by the numbers that mean nothing in my everyday life
I‘m surprised that Safiya wasn’t credited
hey simply i have been watching u for a long long time but reasently i havent really seen anything to you, today i saw this video and im sad to say that i miss the more expessive personality im used to but maybe there is an explanation, are you okay? im sure u got a lot of people to talk to if not, we are all here for you
I think a name is purple holo party?
It should be like             HOLO TACO                Remix       BIRTHDAY EDITION
We Have the same bday!!
TACO FUSION OMGGGGG!!!!!!
Darling lime your soul... Really Christine? We all know your soul is a giant sparkling holo coated raimbow
Happy birthday Christine hope you had a great day ❤️❤️💗💗
witches brew would be a spooky name
Haloween Sky (this was a bit of a typo, but it worked so well)
Belated *HAPPY BIRTHDAY* 😊😊😀😀💚💚💙💙💛💛💜💜💓💓
HAPPY BIRTHDAY! You should make a collection of what your mixing and call it "Holo again" lol
(Name idea) deep through space… and happy birthday to last week on ur bday 🥳!!! ( i don’t think that makes sense but… that’s fine)      Btw I love ur videos (like if you agree, you don’t have to like btw)
The nailpolish should be called as iceland night  (after mixing everything)
mixing all ur overnight oats
all botteled up should be the shade color
You should mix every polish you own
Solar system. The Space theme was the first thing to come to me.
All tacos in a bottle? Call it 'taco tuesday'
That ringlight reflection on your shades is kinda distracting..!!
I’m kinda over this.
idk about the one w all of them but the toppers mix should definitely be called “Rave”
“Spooky simply” “Frankin holo”
I just found out about the b-day special... oof
You should do a using only creme polish challenge 😂
what you got with all the rainbow stuff was true gray, because when you mix all the colors properly with the exact colors, they all cancel each other out, and you end up with true grey. Just a lil slightly more advanced color theory from an artist
These colour remind me of Corrine threadbanger.suit her witchy vibe! Should do a holo taco  colab w/ corrine the witch & safiya the bat! 😘
With all the blues, purples, blacks and got cake color she should call this Birth of the Universe :) so pretty
mixing all her overnight oats??????? and also the protein powders...... but we all know  how the internet handled her overnight oats recipe
definitely call it 'all the tacos'
We have the same birthday!!!
Im thinking for purple SMOKY MIDNIGHT, light navy ICE COLD, black DARK SIDE, dark navy DEEP OCEAN mixed: THE RAINBOW OF HOLO
It's my birthday so I can do what ever I want don't forget from is still ilegal stick to selling glitter and nail powder ☺️
All of her holo glitters
It should be called "all that and a bottle of Holo"
The funny thing is I’ve watched you for so long even before I wanted to be a nail tech and now I’ve wanted to be a nail tech for 3 years and I’m planning on going college to learn it and you showed me my love for nails so thank you for making me realise my future job that I want :)
Holo Taco Supreme
she dose not seam her self
I love the grey creme lol it's beautiful! Also the linear holo mix. Very complex final colour
Please make "Simply Extra"
This was so relaxing

I JUST SAW A HOLO TESLA!!!!!!!!!!!! U SHOULD GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💿💿
Plum Galaxy
mixing all your favorite overnight oats flavors
Has anyone suggested FrankenTaco yet?
the fact that she didnt call it “franken-taco” in honour of safiya makes me very sad
I just realized how many views Cristene actually gets.. you go!

Starry Nite
No drink slave today?!?! WHAT HAPPENED TO BEN!!
your pette simply nailogical
i love your videos simply nailogical

You should mix thing of Ben's stuff
Simply should make this an actual nailpolish set
it should be called the Taco-Verse cause it looks like a galaxy
I am shocked  do you listen  to melaine Martinez  maybe spelled it wrong but who cares
you should mix every cake batter you find at the store and let beeeyyynn make it into one cake and eat it
That question at the beginning iz the most questionable  question
i will never get over how beautiful the menchi polish is,,, also the unicorn toppers are soooo pretty
I know I’m late but call it holo glam again sorry im late
it looks like a midnight galaxy mist purple
tacos in a bottle
Mystic midnight
I think the name should be “simply remixed”
Can u make a video that looks like its for school cause my mom doesn't met me watch u in school and now I'm sad.
I’m surprised that safiya nygaard didn’t help with this.
terrible nightmare
Please!!!!! Please!!!! Make more of “got cake”! It’s already gone!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭
Wa 😁 soda🥤 budaful ✨ soda 🥤 pridy 😏 I neva see bafoe 😂 shine like da brightest staar ⭐️in de intergalactic milke waaya 😳 tan out of tan 😂

Name : why does this make purple ?? 😂😂
Simply should do a frankenpolish line with all the individual ones plus the final product
Name of your cat 😹😀
The cremes need more love, give us more cremes, pleeease
EVERYTHING MIDNIGHT WOULD BE PURFECTO
The nail polish should be named The not so midnight sky
Love your videos. I have a question. How do you stop nail polish falling off after wearing gloves for two hours. At my work we wear plastic gloves while handling everything. And I never can get my nail polish to stay on. Im trying something different today but got any tips
holo hole cuz it reminds me of black hole idk
You said it yourself, simply extra
it gives me lots of extraterrestrial vibes
holoween party!!
I thought beauty science was saf’s thing lol
OMFG THATS SO EXPENSIVE SORRY BUT NO £90 FOR LIKE IDK 7 NAIL POLISHES £27 FOR NAIL FILES Happy b day Christine and good bye
Happy birthday QUEEN 👸 💓
Make another line called “Simply Frankenstein” since you’re following in Safyia’s footsteps with this experiment!! I’d honestly kill for the unicorn skin polish and purple holo polish
Its a galaxy
I feel like safiya would like this one
“Gliterally all of them” or “glitterally all of them” for the name of the polish! Couldn’t decide on the spelling
Maybe Simply Beautiful
Name it "Science Queen Star Dust!"
I want holo taco but I'm in india 😅
Dont know about anyone else but I would love it if one of her lines in the future was the combo mixes plus the first time she combined them all Now not everyone will agree with the names but what do ya want for quick thinking off the top of my head🤗 1st time polsh should be (mix all) this time its the (remix) the creme should be (meh) the holo glitter should be (holoworks) the toppers should be (holos comet) the liner holos should be (holo galaxy) or (holoX) or (holoknockout) the multi-chrome should be (holo-chrome witch or god) thats 8 polishes and the 9th polish being without creme in the mix (no creme holo) aka a new line😏your welcome😁🥰
My husband-  I love that
I think the names should be night sparkle or nightshade
Everything Taco
I was just watching the thumbnail but my brain went  *CRIIIISTIIIINE DA SCIEEENCE QUEEEN*
Mixing all your overnight oats together

Id call the mix "Holo-lujah"
You should call it HOLOween
Pleaasee sell it as a new nail polish, maybe call it like galaxy or sth?
You were thinking to call it Simply Extra, also we haven't seen a full nail peel off in so long...
Simply 33?
You should do acrylic pore with nail polish
Welcome to the "Holo Verse"
Holo Taco polish mountain?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
WE SHARE THE SAME BDAY CRISTINE WTFFFF ME YOU AND EMINEM, just three legends doing our thang..
After hearing you talk about colors and how they would react to each other...I actually thought you were a real scientist
You should paint your back wall holo
the wHOLO taco
Happy birthday its kids cool because my birthday is the 18th of October I just turned 28
You should do a small polish mountain with your polish’s
I’ve missed this it’s my favorite thing to watch you do because you never know what color it’s going to be
"33 Shades"
U should make those colors that u mix a item to buy
mixing all her oats
My birthday is October 17th 2
You should try Olive and June. Also they have theses “dry drops” that you put on your nails after a taco and they dry your nails quickly
Maybe you could name it there’s a menchie hair in the lab
I LOVE this colour... call it 'Mauve over'!! Can I have one?
Cosmic dust would be a good name since it’s spacy and dusty looking
i need this and that duo chrome mix in my life!!!! <3  WOOOOW.... spoopy season approved!
Hal-oh my god
Any discount coupon ? 😅🙏
I honestly really like the calm vibe in this video♥️
Purple taco
I think “all the tac’s” like  all the the talk
Will Royal-Tea Blue come back to Holo Taco??
Why did you say 'this girl alone in her basement' :( you are not alone ve love you soooo much Happy Birthday 💜
Happy late birthday!!   Dude no joke I want some Holo Taco. Though I’m not allowed to buy it. (Sad)   Love you!
Next mix: OATS
HAPPY HOLO-WEEEEEEEEN!!!!!!
the frankenholo
im curious tho if it was just all the glitter without the cremes
For the first one, that turned out purple: cherry berry. For the second one, black: pitch glitter. For the third one which was navy/purple: nighty sky. For the last one that was a light navy: icy navy. And the full result: muddy fall. Also Sophie should try mixing all nail polishes together! That would be cool. Happy birthday
franken-taco
It's just me or do you also think that corine would love that colour??! Kinda galaxy vibes to me 🤷‍♀️
Mix all of your overnight oats recipes together, now it's like mixing all your protein powders together
Halo Taco Explosion!
EAT AN ACTUAL HOLO TACO PLEASE OMG I JUST HAD THIS IDEA IDK HOW ITS GONNA HAPPEN BUT MAKE IT HAPPEN. luv u,
Got cake should’ve been called birthday suit
.... all the tacos? .... taco tuesday?
Just by the title I feel like Saf had some influence here
Dusk galaxy 🌌
Omy my birthdays the 18th
My husband's birthday is October 17th too!!!  🎊🎈🎂🎈🎊 Happy birthday!
Mixing every hot drink from Starbucks
I think it should be called GLOOMSday 🥰
It looked like a blunt in the thumbnail 😂❤️
Safiya nygaard would be proud  also the topper one should be "mad hatter" Cause wonderland is crazy and colorful and a hatter makes hats which means "top" hat
Spray On Shoes would be the PERFEcT name!
Mixing all da OATS!
Her singing is terribly beautiful.
All Holos Eve
Simply special ^
This is like visual asmr and I love ittttt
Name idea: business in a bottle?
Will it be holo...   Irredecent (i dunno)   Will it be.. *pUrPlE*
Call it “holo hell” or “sleepy holo”
Mixing all your oats together. Obviously.
Midnight Putty?
13:52 i literally puked at the thought... this needs to be done immediately
You should make a holo taco collection with all the polish shades you mixed in the little beakers and then also add the one with everything mixed in and call it like “all mixed up” or something
Call it "Skull Berries" for Halloween!!!
Anyone got cake?🌚                  ( thanks I have never have gone this much likes!😚*Edit*
Just watched you snap and damn why you gotta go after one of your supporters like that man they were just saying they liked your content more without politics
Thanks for the Melanie Martinez reference Cristine
That's taupe and I want it to just be called "Odd Remix" for tge fact Taupe is a odd color mix
I think it will be dark purple holo 0:51  Update; I was right it's dark purple holo. It's beautiful 10:51
The Everything Holo

Halo taco Tuesday
mixing all your overnight oats
Mixing all my nail polish together
Holo vomit!!,,,  lol
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🥳!!!!!!!!!!
Tacos in a bottle
Safiya is quaking
Cristine you HAVE to test out this product, its called mani me and i think it would make a very fun video! I first saw this product on youtube a few minutes ago and i was just like OMG CRISTINE HAS TO REVIEW THIS!
The name should be shiny night
Holo taco supreme
“Midnight Shimmer” seems like a great name for this polish
You should market the mixes as individual polishes “Holo Taco Mega Mix”
Pleeeease make that eggplant linear holo, I would almost die to have that on my nails.
You should mix actual tacos! While eating tacos and putting on your taco polish.
How about mixing all your overnight oat recipes into one monster batch?
You asked why everything comes out purple and I'm saying why. The color purple doesn't actually exist in nature as we see it. The color you are seeing are just your eyes seeing blue and red simultaneously and not knowing what to do with it.
I really need you to do some marble effects on your nails with the different categories of your nail polish collection (in exemple the line that are the rainbow colors etc ..) 🤗🖤
You should make cat clock nails
call it the ‘h-all-o nail polish’
happy birthday :)
Hello Christine!! I love your Nails and chanel, and alsow i love harry Potter so i was wondering if you could make a video where you paint your Nails harry Potter themed?? Pls do it bye👋👋
"birthday mash-up"
You should do: "mixing all of My favorite over Night oats together" 🙃
It should be called " Go holo or go home" or maybe better name is " Muddy Berry " since there is no to much flakies...
name suggestion "holo universe"
anyone else think safiya shouldve been present for this?
Ultimate taco 🌮
She looks really healthy
ID CALL THIS STELLAR DUST
What about "Polish Mountain's Peak" because the purple mistiness reminds me of mountains
you HAVE to make this shade 🥺
Sorry I was a week late but HAPYBIRDAY ✌✌
Holoween !!!
That color says it’s name should be “Cat Lady”.
The result has this really cool vibe to me, like, i can see a character who's reserved and practices magic rocking that color.
im just windering whats the background song- :^ wait- im using my brothers acc- whatever- but like can someone tell me the background song- -3-
I want that color!!!!
Black Rainbow    or   Taco Mukbang
video idea water marble holo taco
Monster berry!! it’s a very Halloweenie shade I need holo bats in it 😭🎃
if you released shades that were the mixtures of all the glitters and toppers, i would buy both of them in a heartbeat
You should name it ALL-O TACO.
Taco supreme should be the name lol
Happpppy  birthday
Waiting for a collection called "Simply mixed" that has all the subgroups she just mixed! Plus, next year's birthday polish can really just be "Simply extra"! Give me everything!! 😍
I TOLD MY DAD TO GET ME THE GOT CAKE POLISH AND HE SAID WELL SEE TOMORROW AND I CAME BACK TODAY AND ITS OUT OF STOCK!!!!!!!
I broke my nail 😢
The name should obviously be All O' Tacos
name idea for the nail polish: HOLO THEM ( sounds like all of them)
You should have a scale to weigh to make sure you get even amounts
Could have used a scale and weighed it adding equal amounts lol
Plum holo... but you should do a Halloween collection... with Safiya...
Cristine... I’ve watched every. Single. One. If your videos please start uploading more!!!
Okay but you should definitely release the mixed linear holo one! I love "the dark rainbow" as a name!
Cristine! You could mix all types of cat food together to see if menchie and zyler eat it! 😋
he this is your supper fan i seen all your vids for your next vid can you come visit me in sascachewan canada that would really make my day ps i know you hat dogs but i sadly have  pitbull her name is spirit she kinda nibles so please come visit in your next vid i will tell u my ddress
The skyy of velariiiis for who knows
I'd call it "I'm a holo in a bottle"
Taco overload?
I think the combined Holo mix should be  called Holo-sphere or Holospace because it reminds me of space or the night sky. And the flakies polish mixture to me resembled your Got Cake polish.
Name for the nail polish 💅- Holo Party
Happy late birthday!!!!
100 holo definetly
I think this should be called menchie hair
Franklin nail polish
Happy Birthday to our HOLO queen!!!!!!!!
This is without a doubt the shade of Holosexuality!
11:28 Is she using the Motionless In White song "Necessary Evil" as a rhythm??? Or is it something else lol? 😂🤔
I just got my first holo nail polish this week! I also ordered a few from Holo Taco, but couldn't wait, so I bought a green one from Walmart, and I love it. I'm so excited to play with the ones coming in the mail!!
"I need Space" as a name
Happy birthday!!!!!!!!
it’s been a while since i have watched her content, is it just me or has she lost some of her spark? i wouldn’t blame her, 2020 has been literal hell. i hope she’s doing ok
I think you should call it simply everything
Midnight holo?
Omg she should mix her oatmeal
Name for this: Taco Party Pack
YOU SHOULD CALL IT MENCHIES GALAXY
Call it.... simply not simple
Mixing all your oats together
When you sang pity party I  S C R E A M E D - I was so shocked to know that you even know who Melanie Martinez is- not a lot of people do 😔🤚🏼
Should call it muted halo
The shade should be called spill the tea
Everybody gangsta until somebody said "Her long nails are my short nails."
This so satisfies
Her edition of pity part by melanie martinez is amazing
CALL IT MIDNIGHT MIX
hear me out “the safiya” for your nail polish
“ITS NOT A HOLO ANYMOREEEE”
Simply extra
Can you send this to Safiya? I think she would really like it, and you can name it the Franken Polish
I would call it Dark alien😊😊
𝓲𝓽 𝓼𝓱𝓸𝓾𝓭 𝓫𝓮 𝓬𝓪𝓵𝓵𝓮𝓭 𝓽𝓱𝓮 𝓮𝓿𝓮𝓻𝔂𝓽𝓱𝓲𝓷𝓿 𝓫𝓾𝓽 𝔂𝓱𝓮 𝓴𝓲𝓽𝓬𝓱𝓮𝓷 𝓼𝓲𝓷𝓴
I know u probably won't read this but I think fr a video idea u should do like a bunch of nail quizzes like buzzfeed lol or a nail tech course
pls makes this an actual color
It could be called dusty cardigan 😂
You should do something like mixing every one if the blue polishes you have to see what color blue it'd turn out as or mixing all my pink,green,yellow, purple just maybe ur favorite color besides holo
Happy bdayyy queen!!!!😌
Garbage can
happy birthday ! Your just simply  a Queen!😂🥳🎁
"Holo cardigan" I like this name
If this is not called “All Holos Eve” then I’m raging. Perfect color for the name and made in October!
Call it the "heart of holo"
Cristine the science queen would be frickin hilarious 😂
i think the name could be "wiches magic"
Simply haloads
Nail polish idea: colors based off your favorite teas
I mean you've got to call it winter cardigan or spooky season.
For your next collection you should sell all of the polishes that were mixed together from each little jar thing
Holloween polish
Make Simply Extra pleeeeeeeeeease! 😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩
This is so satisfying
*reads title* Me:...brown
Arcane purple or maybe dust storm violet? Those two just popped into my head
HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY CRISTINE!!!!!!!!!
Do a Hoolowen video
I think it’s dusty also bc the rainbow collection is so full coverage and pigmented!!!
The  Dark Side of The Rainbow
Simply Medley ✨🌈
while I really love people's suggestions of "All Holo's Eve" how about "Purple Holo Rain" ?  also, cant wait for the holo taco nail oil pens to come out! 😄
Yess!!!! For all hair dye mixing 😍
Allo Holo
Why do I feel like these colors are gonna be the next holo taco collection colors?
You forgot the Kreme ‘Benana’
Hey Cristine your swollen eye could it be because you drink tea too much? Because I heard tea can throw the water that u drink.  try drink more water and less tea try it for 1 week 👍👍👍☕☕☕🙏🙏🙏 like please so Cristine can see this thank youu
You should mix together all of your mixes! Lol
call it "holo taco supreme"
Happy late bday
Mixing my galaxy is one
You could use a kitchen scale and measure by weight to be more accurate.
The mix reminds me of a galaxy! Really pretty!
I'm thinking that most videos like this (including Safiya's) end up being purple result-wise because red, blue, and purple are the most appealing colors to the general public so those three overpower any other colors and they end up mixing into purple.
Galaxy holo taco
Am i the only one who thinks its funny that she said that she paid attention in color theory and then said that it turns brown when you put everything together but actually it should get black when you put every color in equals together xD
omg the dark eggplant holo was SO GORGEOUS please make that!!!
IT'S SO PREEEEEETTYYYYYYY
STOP SAYING BAD WORDS
Hair dye  Starbucks menus  Something
You could call it Deep Purple… But I think my age is showing
Why is it always "Menchie hair" and never "Zyler hair"?
Happy birthday 🎂
"Lots of mixes"
The shade should be called "better 2020" bc it's a mess...like 2020...just better
Halo taco premium 😂❤️
Halo galaxy
Saf should mix all condiments together
"Menchi-hair in the lab" sounds like a fitting name to this experiment

I dub thee holo tacolypse
Happy birthday even though im late 💖
Mix all of your oats together! 😂💜🎉
All holo’s eve
Just POURple idk lol
You could mix together all the flavors of overnight oats
Dusty velvet
You should mix every hair die at the store and die your hair with it
Party purple
Crazy party
Love the energy in this video
Starglazer
Call it “holo birthday”
The name in your words should be "desaturated dark fall berry purple"
That’s actually such a gorgeous color omg
“I dream of holo”
Christine should do a collab with Anne Reardon  and make holo sugar bowls. Or edible holo.
Cristine you should try to do acrylic art (nail polish art) using nail polishes or holo taco polishes
Holo quesadilla

"My Soul"😂

Now bottle that mixture up and name it "simply galaxy" 💫👽
Can’t wait to see you mix all your overnight oat flavors together! 😂
That Multichrome mix spoke to me on WAY to many levels. As for the name of the mega blend... I feel its name should be "Holo Cosmos".
It looks like the spray on shoes from cloudy of a chance of meatballs
Please mix all the hair dyes at the drug store and then apply the monstrosity to a wig so your hair doesn’t fall out lol
Simply Galaxy
I bet it’s purple
Ohhh name it “Holo Inside”
"Supreme" like taco supreme.
Omg I want the re mix
You should have bottled the sub mixes AND the frankenpolish... the sub groups were actually all pretty nice... Also, this is far to satisfying to watch. #quarantinedtoolong
11:28 Melanie Martinez could never
you should name that halo purple mix "Party Blast"
Most of Cristine's vids: FRICK THAT BS  This video: Calming lofi music in between mixes  Cristine are you feeling ok?
"Analysis Paralysis" from when you can't decide which shade to wear, so you wear all of them. Also analysis because science.
frakentaco
Top 4 nicest people:  1. Bob Ross  2. Alec Shane Benjamin  3. Keanu Reeves 4. Any Canadian
Why don’t you go to polish mountain with every sub category like you did in this one, and then one nail with everything.
a better name would be “all in one” or “mix the berries!”
I came up with: 'dusty Halloween night' ?-
I love ur videos
Call it  “Trivial Midnight” “Midnight Trivialities” “Purple Pleasure” or “Purple Pleasures”
React to ur first video
You should release the colours that you mixed as their own collection theyre all so pretty 💞💕
"Galaxy dust" could be a nice name
I have the black pillow u have😋
I think it should be called oops all holos
ok now make a collection of all these colors pls'
Very blessed belated birthday wishes from South Africa ❤️ your videos 🤗🤗🤗
GALAXY
Crushing on this color! Def something I’d wear, it’s like an icy blue violet with extra holo

She should name it dark soul, because she said it’s dark like her soul
You should give this polish to safya 😁
Since she said it's dark like her soul I thought "Holo Soul"  because we're holo on the inside much original yes thank you bye
4:34 you NEED to release a polish like that!!! It’s so beautiful I would wear it everyday
Holo Burrito! Because it is filled with EVERYTHING!
Perfect shade name would be All'o Tacos Such a pretty color
Have you talked to Saf about this? You should've invited her 😂
Personally I'd call this "Genie in a holo" because of the whole Aladdin movie vibe of purple.
You should name it holos splash
name suggestion: “simply the best” but I guess nobody is old enough to get the tina turner reference 😂
Haha, no I get why the only multichrome I could find in drug stores near me was icy blue to purple!! 🤣 They just threw in whatever they had and voilá!
where’s the simply extra drop
If any one can answer me plz do bc I really need it I want to bye my sisters the holo taco nail polish so is it international
The flakies mix looks like unicorn jizz
I came here looking for comments about how irritating it was that all I could see in the reflection of her safety goggles was the ring light!  Come on, girl..... This is not your first video!

You and Safiya should mix together your cats hair and knit/crochet a hairy styles sweater then it would be a Zyler, Menchie, and Crusty 🐈🐱🐈🥼💅
You pulled a Safiya.....very happy about this is very making me happy.Thank ya :)
You could mix all your morning oats together 🤷‍♀️
Spooky season Halo for the name
Holo Taco is the only nail polish that deserves its price
Happy late Birthday :))))
Happy birthday, dude.
Name ideas for polish name: Holo galaxy Midnight shine/ sparkle Holo soul Dark birthday Just some ideas if you do choose to sell it and / or choose a name
Idk about anyone else but if it's called anything other than "Science Queen" I'll riot.
Taco truck
A cute name would be “All da Tacos”
It can be “🌮ATHTIOB🌮” which is short for “🌮all the holo tacos in one bottle 🌮”
My spoopy birthday

holo remix

Happy birthday
You should do a polish mountain with your brand
“all that glitters is purple” is what i was thinking the whole video and is also my name suggestion :D
Oh no it’s out of stock!! I would love to buy one, we have the same birthday. Happy late bday! Hope you enjoyed you solitude and nail painting. Will this come back or is it out forever?
Mixed magic 🌝
MIX DIFFERENT OAT FLAVORS
Franken polish! O.O
Name it "here's  to 33"
Holo night sky would be a nice name for the mixed holo taco
Space science 👑
This is not a negative comment, I promise. I'm just curious as to why her nails are so yellow.🤔
I would so buy that first grey colour. Beautiful!
Happy birthday!!! 🎂🎊🎉🎈🎁
Possible name: All Halo’s Eve for spooky season
Nail polish name: Spoopy scary Skeleton
I know I sound snobby, and I don't mean to. Although, Adding all the primary and secondary colors should make Black. Adding contrasting colors make brown
Try Starry Winter, Frost Bite or Night Frost, since it looks pretty similar to them!! 😃
It could be named midnight owl 🙃
~Twilight Musk~
1:06
Franken polish
Simply Galactic, it's a pretty deep purple and it looks like stars so yeah
Halo-ween special All Halo’s Eve
remix
MIX ALL UR OATS
My bday is the 23rd and I turn 31 lol were the same age!!
You could use a small scale next time :-P
Holoing & Tacoing This would be a great name
2:07 where will Ben be??
Happy Belated
Galactic Holo
“Hol-lot going on”
Omg Simply Extra would be so cool! And the formula would change over time as you make more polishes.
Galaxy Holo
A Witch you may Holo-ween.
Cristine we like it when you talk. You could stop putting music and talk more
Safiya could mix every single yogurt flavor and you should do every fruit together in a blender just the fruit no base liquids
Call this blend midnight star
Oh, it's gorgeous. Would definitely wear this
my name is christina and born on oct 16 i think we are met to be
Space dust would be a cool name for it...
U awesome
WE HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY!! QUEEN CHRISTINE!! Queen Mickey!! Yasssss!!! Happy belated BIrthday !!!
It looks kind of like your holo tea kettle
Mixing all your oat mixes together 😍
I was about to comment, “you spelt color wrong” Then I realized
Why did you fully sound half dead in this video
Call it unicorn vomit uwu
I feel like the reason majority of the mixes look purple is because theres really something much more amazing going on our eyes just can’t process it. Purple is the most complex colour for our eyes to process so we’re just seeing it to our best ability!!
Holo In A Bottle, For a name
She should do a gothic themed halo line with blacks and purples and stuff
mixing all of your overnight oats that you make!
Mixed concoction
It probably turns purple since red, blue and purple are a lot more visible than orange and yellow, you also only had one green polish so that wouldn’t impact the mix. From what I could you also had lots of purple and blue holos, unicorn skins, and multi chrome polishes.
Mixing all your cats treats together
I know you're working from home currently BUT if you were to break one of your nails at work (and i dont thinknyou would but) would you be able to successfully sue the company you work for, i guess in your case the Canadian Gov. Lol ?
Call it “Simply Insane”
The first color you mixed was almost my eye color if was more gray and blue (so basically less purple)
10:11 I feel like it should’ve been named “midnight blare” if it would’ve been a nail polish
Name could be holo universe
Happy b-Day 🎉🎉🎊🎊🎁🎁🎈🎈
Call it “taco season”
Simply Everything :)
I think you should call it Miss Galaxy.
I would name it “when the party’s over” because it look like the floor after a house party ✨
Simply holo
Happy birthday
Name it "simply all"
i’d only the website shipped to greece 💔
All-o Taco! ! ❤️❤️❤️🦄
Mix everything oat-relevant ingredient into overnight oats!
I think it looks like Galaxy polish x
who else skipped to the final colour??😂
HOLO-WEEN!!!!
not the fituber shampoo screenie for that moment xD
Mixing all the OATS
Mix all spicy ramen flavoursssss
Holo mauvo
Cute name would be COSMIC Mix (Cosmix)??🤔
She should have the actual final shade as a new shade on her website and call it “we’re all in this together”
YASS
Call it galaxy dust or deep space smoke
Cristine is a 32year ladyyyyyyyyy✨💫
Simply Exotic
This video is so...
Does anybody else absolutely love that she said “baby beaker “😂🙃
Omg u got the same birthday as my nephew and cousin ❤️❤️❤️
When are you going to ship to the uk ??????
I miss you and saf ❤
Holoween.
You should mix all the hair dyes with corrine as a guest lol
Your new mixture could be named Holo Extravaganza
Dark Side Holo
simply enough  or simply everything
Franken-holo (like safiya)
Name suggestion : holo friends   Make this on your nail polish line
belated happy birthday!
"This is the reemiiiix" would be a good name lol
it gives me "starry night" vibes for sure! like all the holo are the stars in the night sky!! I really vibe with this colour though lol
I think you should mix all the same colors but every color is a different brand. Like all your pinks mix them together ans show us what pink you come out with
The perfect holo taco collab
Don’t be shy make the Mixed colors a new collection :)
Truly disappointed this wasn't a collab with Safiya named 'Frankenholo'
Name suggestion: Birthday Noir
Mixing All of the parfume in Sephora 😂
Who else wants her to do a kpop nail art?
Happy birthday 🎈🎉🎂
Happy birthday!
Hological taco
Christine, please please! Do metallic polish gang in the future! I love nail polish that looks like metal!
you should release these mixes as there own set!
Safiya could try mixing all the perfume together to create a frankenperfume or frankenfume
All-O Taco!!! 💿💗
BUT LAST TIME  IT WAS GRAY
DO MIXING ALL YOUR NAIL POLISH NOT HOLO NAIL POLISH THX
its quite witchy so maybe something like 'Witches Brew' xo
Happy Birthday!
Franken Holo or Holoween
You should mix all your overnight oats together!!!!
Mixing all the overnight oats recipes and make ben taste them 😏😏😏
Ok totally off topic but what does Christine do now that Ben doesn't go get her tea. Like I know she can make tea lattes at home but there is something unique about store bought blends
mixypolish
Please make and sell this color
It’s kinda like frosted grapes
MIXING ALL THE HAIR DYES!
omg collab with safiya
Cristine: *jokes about simply extra nail polish* Me: ... please tho...
🤔 Holo taco’s 🌮 own charcoal delight
How did Cristine get her hands on patanjali shampoo😭😭 it's shit man
Safiya should melt down all the halloween candy and mix them together.
I think you should have done the whole bottles and then you could have had a Frankenstein nail polishes like Sophia's videos
You could mix all your different oats together
YOU NEED TO MALE SIMPLY EXTRA
Galaxy taco
mega taco
galaxy holo
The fact that I just realized she was born on my birthday 💀

HAPPY BDAY CRISTINE❤️💓   i love this video and the colors, and i just want to tell you i would simply die for that topper and flakie mix as a polish, it’s so utterly mezmerizing;-;

It all else fails   " Simply Mixed "
The final mix should be called  Simply Galactic  And the rainbow ones should be poured in one as layers so when you paint your nail its all random and tie dye and it should be called: Simply Rainbow  These nail polishes should be a special edition so you could have a SimplySpecial page on the website and if you buy one you get another polish 20% off  Hope this helps and that you read this💕💅
Simply Everything (unoriginal I know, but it's to the point) Also I love the color, please release that as an official shade, I would buy it
mixing all of ur overnight oats!!!
Mixing all your oats!
The multi-chrome would be nice in a gradient
I'm a bit disappointed Cristine. You are a data need like me, but you chose the inaccurate '2 second pour' over the far more accurate weight method. You need a scale for the next time you mix girl!
Please do a polish mountain with all of the flakeies and linears
Girl you 32 i thought you were 21

Sorry i have no idea where i was going with that im really bad with explaining stuff

So, is purple the color equivalent to 42?
Frankentaco? Or maybe Simply Everything? But also maybe Simply The Best considering it's a little bit of what is yours which makes it the best (also, because I had The Best by Tina Turner stuck in my head for no reason what so ever).
You could call is "33 is up"
Eggplanty birthday

This should have been the wedding nail colour for #SafiyaNygaard
It might turn purple since red and blue are the ends of the color spectrum, and since we are seeing them both at the same time we see purple?

MIXING ALL CONDIMENTS TOGETHER
Why don’t you paint you cats nails 😅
It should be named as "Franken-taco" or "taco universe"
The final color gave me very "Starry Night" vibes, which would be a nice fall/winter release 👀 just saying
Mixing all the hairdyes of a convenience store sounds like a very interesting idea yet way to dangerous for our allergy queen !

So she should paint her walls in the these so each room has one wall of a different mixture 💚

Maybe Simply Spooky Season??
Oddly enough,  the music was stressing me out. 🥴

Holo-seption

franken-holo
Simplychaos would be an interesting name.
what about franken-taco; in line with spooky season?
Am I watching you video at 1:30 in the morning while I’m working on a press on set? Why yes yes I am. Why you ask? Cuz I had a bit too much expresso late in the night 😬 but hey.... the creative juices are flowing and that’s what counts.  That final mixture came out purchase worthy tho 👌🏽👌🏽
You should call it " dark like my dusty soul"
What about - Dont bewitch me! - perfect for spooky season, and the color is kinda spooky👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🥳🥳
Everyone gansta until she breaks a nail
Glitter and holo looks amazing with every shade which is why most people love glitters and especially girls🙋🏼‍♀️
Okay, okay. So I have a weird obsession w color theory (artist + art history major), so lemme try to explain this... iI hope it makes sense!   You might think that in any given "mixing all my ____ together" the end result would be brown because of art class and the color wheel, but the ones I've seen turn out purple, like yours. This is because the volume of cyan and magenta pigment is more than yellow pigment, leaning overall toward purple the most. If all the pigments were equally used in the formulas, then it would obviously be brown. I suspect that could happen if greens, oranges, and yellows were more popular colors to paint your nails with! What is most mystifying to me is how dark the franken-holo taco was, but I assume the formulas use more black/dark blue pigment than I would expect in order to get a bold, jewel-tone look.   Aaahh, a wall of text that i don't know if anyone will see, nice :)
you can try acrcylic pour with nailpolish
Y did I think this video was from years ago
Witchy mix
I say call it genie in a bottle

Weigh each nail polish in the mixture to
Sophia can mix blood types
32 nail polish colors, 32 on trending, Cristine is 32. 😳
I resubscribed! I was a die hard fan since long before polish mountain. She hit it big with that video and things changed to super high energy, and cringe. This felt like the old Cristine. ❤️
does anyone else think she resembles Amy Coney Barrett?
Name for the New Polish: HoloInOne
Holoween holo
I work at Subway. I had one customer come in a few times and order a footlong wheat with EVERY SINGLE MEAT except pork products on the single sandwich. This was back when we had roast beef, rotisserie chicken, seafood, whatever. It took two people (me with my baby hands and someone else who STILL couldn’t do so alone) to close this monster of a sub.  In fact we were talking about it today, and we concluded that the easiest way to do this sub without breaking the bank would be to do a “teriyaki/strips” sub with a 6” portion of each meat: strips, teriyaki chicken, roasted chicken, tuna, turkey, steak. And actually in hindsight, missing the other meats would actually make this WAY easier to close. Even with every single veggie and cheese (as she would do).
Only Christine can make nail polishes sound smart and scientific. 😂
holy shit its #32 on trending
Pleasee do hair colours mixing video!!!
I’m obsessed with this color. 😍
One step galaxy nails
This video is sooo magical , i mean , i felt so relaxed while watching it ♥️
Mix all your over night oats and have Ben try it
So... You know i have to say it... Cristine I want you to try acrilic pour art nail polish edition. That chaotic energy plus an actual artwork result (plus a bit of cleaning). Pleeeeeease 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Kinda looks like a dark denim-y blue, maybe Jean Jacket?
You should name it “Holo Everyone”
She should sell these shades!!!
She really did turn into an infomercial channel for holotaco

Name: city at midnight
It should be called Taco Buffet
i really appreciate the filming and editing style here. it was thoroughly enjoyable to watching the close up mixing  with the chill music
"color of the universe" it reminds me of the night sky
Since theres more purple shading/color similarities, the color leaned towards the purple
I want that colour, lowkey considering making it myself 👀👀👀
Number 32 on trending ??? Conspiracy!
OML PUT IT ON THE MARKET AND CALL IT DRYER LINT
simply mixed and matched
I think the name should be “32 year old lady” it’s your birthday, how many nail polishes you have, AND it’s a shoutout to Jenna!
"32 YeaR olD LaDyyYyy"
"Looks like my favorite uninviting wall paint" I about died laughing at that and it really wasnt that funny but sounded like something i would say 😂😂😂😂😂
I kinda want her to do it again with out the crems
I need the holos,  all of them 😭😥
Make the original mixtures before you added them into one a polish!
Mixing all the overnight oats
( John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. ) We are living out Revelations in the Bible, please repent with your mouth to God and admit you are a sinner, Jesus died for us all and if we accept this gift he did we can be saved but we have to first repent and ask the Holy Spirit to come into Our lives and turn from sins. Believe Jesus died and rose again 3 days later so we can all be saved!! Pray often and seek a true relationship with God and get a Bible. Start reading your Bible, KJV is one type but this is an example where you can start. I know the Bible in Revelations talks about end times, we are living that out now. Please choose Jesus while he can still be found!  You Don't know when your last breath will be! 🙏💐😄
Love the color! ALO-HOLO
Since it’s all the “tacos” in a bottle, perhaps the name “Night Nachos” or “Holo Nacho”?
Simply Blendlogical.  Simply Fallogical.  Simply Extralogical
Holo taco should make a science queen nail polish kit. Where you can create a nail polish.
The name of the finale polish should just be galaxy it is the perfect all in one galaxy polish
Happy birthday
#32 on trending wow
Happy late Birthday!
"Like My Soul" new polish name

Dark Brown. Redish brown. Also known as process black. Its called subtractive color. They actually teach this in school. 3rd grade, I think it was. Why oh why do people watch IDIOTS. (no, I didn't watch, just saw the title).

This polish should be called extra taco

How did u make nail polish that's so cool i gotta get some I love doing my nails and lately I've been doing some boring pink nails with hot pink glitter nail polish kinda getting boring I asked my parents for nail polish for Christmas
Happy B-Day Cristine! I love the mixed polish! It looks like a galaxy and my first thought was that Corinne would totally love this!
lets guess that she has 2555 nail polishes and each cost around 19 dollars then she has spent around 48,545 anyone else shook.
This just showed up in my recommended but I'm not mad it very interesting
This feels like a deja vu because I litterally saw a similar video from you 2 years ago.
Milky Way or Nebula
A cute name would be “All Holo’s Eve” for Halloween instead of hallows eve
Your polish makes me think of all the galaxy stuff Corinne does on her channel!
Holo-ween it reminds me of a holloween  purple

Looks like a night sky
You should make these as a collection, you could call it "Mixed Up Colelction"
The polish should be called amethyst ice rink 🔮
Well I guess we need a retry minus cremes ?
hello sandwich artist from subway. I do actually have a regular who comes in and gets literally 'everything' in a salad. the only thing I don't add is the meatballs otherwise I give him everything. even a bag of crushed chips mixed in. add a large soda, and after CA tax rates the total comes to 26.08 lol
I’d buy that
Looks cute especially for this time of year makes me think it was midnight purple that they like to use sometimes around Halloween
Call it simply extra
Wait.. Why doesn't Cristine have a Holo Labcoat yet???
all the holo taco in one bottle should be called Holo TacALL

Would you consider making a nail polish for UV lamp?
Next time you do something with Oats Overnight you should mix all of the flavors together

You should name it  “MIDNIGHT MIX” cause you mixed them... And it is a dark purple... Lol
Holo all should be the name
I figured everything would be ugly brown, I was wrong it’s all butiful🥰
don't mind me, just watching this video for the third time

YOU CAN NAME IT ALL'O TACO
A colour I call burple, everyone knows that...
"All The Queen's Men" for a polish name
I think the name should be a whole lotta holo or Christine the science queen
It could be "Everything Taco" kinda like an "Everything Bagel"
If you have a shadow but she couldn’t give away a pretty nail polish please give it to me because I have a gun it’s up it’s up
Happy birthday
Since u painted it after ur got cake it should b named as after party
Holo- the remix
Cristine using Bretman Rock's intro music (11:57) and Bretman also using her intro music in his videos always gets me
“mixing all my overnight oats recipes” 😂
How can you call it anything but "Everything But The Taco"??   Please do mix all your protein though, I've done a few mixes to improve flavors I don't love but only in a single shake.
mixing all your flavours of overnight oats!!
A SYRINGE, CRISTINE! A SYRINGE WOULD MEASURE PRECISE ML AND NOT WASTE ANY POLISH!!!!!! My peer review says your results are invalid, please try again using a proper form of measurement
Cristine is now a 32 year old laaaaaady
Mix all the hair dyes together and dye your hair that color 👀👀
Double stuffed halo taco or stuffed halo taco
Simply Not Simple
this was so therapeutic
YouTube: *SuBsCrIbE AnD NeVeR MiSs NeW ViDeOs* Me: Bish I’m already subscribed
it should be called supreme halo taco
Extra logical
The hairdye sounds like a great idea actually, especially because you'll have no idea what it looks like until it's on hair (or a good wig)
Trump is the last man standing in the way of the satan worshipping cabal harvesting adrenochrome on a global scale from kidnapped children.
Taco Supreme
Cristine went from using random nail polish for her intro to her own nail polish for the intro
A Holo New World - name if the full range of holos combined!
happy birthday cristine!! i think you could call the polish 32 years young
If Cristine were to ever release a polish similar to that the name "Galaxy Brain" or "Galaxy on the brain" really sticks with me SHJSJDJS
Galaxy shimmer
Cristine coming for Saf's brand
These all need the be shades ASAP!!!

Mixing all your overnight oats!
Mixing all of them could be named extra, each year mix in the new ones and it would be that years edition. Leave out the crems and call it the soul of Cristine. Mix all the overnight oats. Safiya can mix all of your nail polishes you have on your shelf. It can be an after covid collab
Happy birthday two days late

"Multi taco" or "taco buffé"
I mean... Wholo Taco (for now)
Wish she would name the mixture “galaxy taco” cuz it literally looks like the galaxy😍
Happy birthday Cristine!  How about HB-32 Its self explanatory and scientific!

Let's call that Holo-mix
Make a hallowen-themed video and name it hollowen taco! (Sure your nail art should be like scared and you use candy or joke😆)

You should call that mix “All Dressed” 😁
I don't paint my nails but I've been obsessed with Cristine since like 2015 and I want to buy all the polishes 😂

Mix all of the different flavors of overnight oats and create Super Oats!! Happy Birthday!!

That Pity Party reference tho~

that is LITERALLY the PERFECT galaxy polish
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!! 🥳🎂🎉🎉🎂🎉🥳🥳🎉🥳
I really don't understand why people get upset about weather forecasts changing, especially when it's so far out? You have no control over the weather, you're simply using data from the past and patterns to estimate what sort of weather may or may not happen. I appreciate the work you put into this and find the data fascinating. Thank you for being honest and passionate enough about your channel and work to recognize when estimates have changed and relay that information to us.
As soon as I saw I thought it would be brown
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Yesterday was my grandpas birthday too and just turned 85 years old 💕 happy birthday
Idea for the name of everything mixed together "AlloTaco"

”Purple Nurple” or ”Eggplant Purple”👍🏾✨

You should call It my dark soul
Call it the FrankenTaco 😉 Just ask Saf if that's okay
Safiya should mix PERFUMES!!! What smell could come out of mixing like 20 perfumes???

Punny idea for the hybrid nail polish name “Taco All About it”
Safiya Nygaard would totally love this color!
Happy birthday!!!!!!!!!!! <3
Call it science queen!!!!!!
Happy Birthday! My name idea for the polish is "Simply Unique". Again Happy Birthday!
The endresult looks a little bit like a Galaxy...
You should call it Birthday mix 2020  and each year mix the Holo so you'll have a new mix
For the name maybe: the taco mix;))
When we were small me and my little sister decided to mix all of our Godmothers nailpolishes, expect we did it in a plastic cup, that melted at the bottom because duh chemicals, andddd then we got nailpolish all over everything xD

Seeing the box of the ‘got cake?’ nail polish made me remember that Ben tried to show it in her last video 🤣
Cristine has the same birthday as my grandpa and my dad’s girlfriend. That’s cool.
Ajjajaaaaaaaj that Got cake!
Happy belated birthday Cristine...hope it was a great one! 1988 was truly a great year! (Fellow 32 yr old lady here).
My birthday is a day before yours 🥰😽
She should sell the same colors of the mixes she made. I would totally wear that grey one all the time!❤️❤️❤️
“Holo Universe”  It reminds me of like the universe images you see, the stars and darkness.

Who else thinks Christine should paint a whole entire wall with halo nail polish?👀
It's your birthday? Same with my brother birthday🤣🤣🤣

Mixing all of your glossy tacos to see if ITS THE STRONGEST GLOSSY TACO
Name for all of the polishes mixed up 'Simply Chaos' or 'Simply Chaotic'
Party Hour for name idea
It looks like galaxy 😮😮😮 🧠 💥
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.”  #LordJesusiscoming
Purple bomb
Happy B-day!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

The polish pour cuts of the videos are so sexual to me lmao
It reminds me of a galaxy.
Omg watching this high asf omg 🥴
Now I want to see a base coat of all four crème polishes, topped with all the others mixed together.
The most  00:14:27 wasteful time I’ve ever spent on YouTube

Mixing all your overnight oats
she sounds so serious here, is she ok? Especially every time she says something like 4:49 5:48 6:04 she sounds as if someone held her at gunpoint and forced her to make that video.. but maybe that's just science-queen christine's way to talk..
Video idea- mixing all oats into one simply oat 😃
You have to send this to Safia. It looks like a color for her
I’d nami it „If Safiya got full set of Holo Tacos”
3:34 ‘looks like my favourite shade of uninviting wall paint’ Me with two of my bedroom walls that exact colour: 👁👄👁

This should be called “ Holo Prime “ . i’m in love with the way this came out, it gives me galaxy vibes.

“Taco with the lot”
safiya would love this!😂
i really liked hearing her critically think through her hypothesis with every mixture. it was cool to follow her thought process
I would totally buy the mixture of toppers and also that last color too.
It should be called frankenholo. Safiya vibes
For your next nail challenge you should do potted plants nails I saw it on Facebook. You make a little pot on your nails and you fill it with dirt and small plants
So do we get a video mixture without the cremes polish
It should be Safiya Nygaard
I like the mixing shampoos one lmfao
' Dark pixie dust ' for the win ! #holoName

THE WAY CRISTINES BIRTHDAY IS 2 DAYS BEFORE MY DADS BIRTHDAY AND SAFIYA’S IN 2 DAYS AFTER MINE-
I got the new polish as a birthday present for myself along with the one coat black and super gloss, it's my first time buying the holo taco polish and I'm really excited about it. I'm finally at a place in my life where i can afford to spend money on these sorts of things
That steel grey is the exact colour of the wall in my living room 😅
Perfect for halloween
HBday Queen 💖🌞
All HOLOs eve !!!!!! Lol
I would just call this color genie
Mixing overnight oat recipes!!!
Me watching this at 2 am on a Sunday night when I have class at 7:30 tomorrow👁👄👁
"Like, what do you get when you mix colors, that are more than one color?" An Abomination, Cristine. An abomination.
Hardcore holower = holo follower  No? Just trying it on
Find the "WalterCoinProof" channel on Telegram, read the proofs, and start profiting today
Honestly the name "multi taco" is a good name for this polish
Got two of the new polish, and HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
Purple is the new Brown
That is so pretty and satisfying 😍
Happy Birthday Cristine! 🥳 You could mix all the oats together!
The video is #25 on trending yay
Happy birthday Cristine
“Genie in a Bottle”

Do it with out the crems
🍺 HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🍾
Well happy late birthday 🎂
Stop
Should be called ALL-O Taco. 😂
I'm hoping someone already suggested mixing all your flavored overnight oats together
Kall it simply everything
lmao my moms exactly a decade older than her
Me: Oh, that mixed color's so pretty, I would wear that!!  Cristine: It's okay, probably something a coworker would wear.  Me: *remembers Simply's french tip video where she throws shade at boring manicures people wear to work*  Me: Oh... I've become the boring coworker...
Cristine should mix all her overnight oats
Why is this corine in a bottle ?
90s vibe lady 👽😈🤝🏼🇨🇺👌🏼😍🤦🏻‍♀️👓
You can mix all your oats
https://youtu.be/ZfUF8nfmTvI
Me going to ask my mom for all of the holo taco nail polish for Christmas
You should name it purple surprise
HAPPY BIRTHAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"It's the remix baby"
Happy birthday Cristine! I always remember yours bc it's 10 days after mine 😂
Happy birthday!!!
Oki but like why is no one talking about the fact that there wasn’t any peel-porn😂 I was a little disappointed lol but still a great video nonetheless.
Why is this even trending? How?
It's a bit of a mouthful, but I think a great name for your All-The-Holo-Tacos-In-One-Bottle would be Aubergine Andromeda! It's pretty much eggplant shade, but looks like a galaxy! :D And it's got that sweet, sweet alliteration.
The mixing dye idea isn't bad, just mix it together and dye your tips, them cut them off, no one will notice the difference 😂
Happy birthday, Cristine <3 Best wishes from Brazil
“Frozen Ash Grapes” is a good name
Simply Kool Aid, purple kool aid
Simply My Soul
Is it just me that noticed she is actually singing, Necessary Evil - Motionless in White? At 11:27

Happy belated birthday!!!
Simply’s Soul or Devilish Emoji or Allo Taco I like all of those names also  HAPPY BIRTHDAY SIMPLY🎂 just know we are all celebrating with you silently in the comfort of our own homes but idk I’m high on nail polish fumes
This very much says "Empress" to me! It's such a rich shade that's not so in your face but still such an attention grabber! I really wish to make that shade for myself one day.
Idk why but when you have a darker blue could you think about the name navy blurr 😂🤷🏼‍♀️
Is it just me or does this video feel Off?
Happy birthday Cristine 🎂🎂
Sorry I’m like 2 hours late but happy birthday❤️❤️❤️
It's a FrankenTaco 😍❤️
For all of them mixed together you should make it in honor of Saf
Happy birthday!!!!!   Also, No ones going to comment on her motionless in white reference, or at least the sound alike to it @ 11:28
“simply christine”
Holo nachos
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🎊🎈🎂🎁🎉
First, happy birthday!   Second, maybe repeat this experiment with a bit of EVERY one of your polishes? Not just your name brand but your entire collection. Too much? I know you have literal 1000's.
Happy birthday💖
Happy birthday science queen
Next vid:holo polish mountain
I REALLY love the look of all the different scattered holos mixed together, with the different colors of holo glitters. Honestly I'm kind of bummed that I can't buy a polish that looks like that, made up of multicolored holo glitters. It's so cool how the different colors catch the light at different times when you move the stick. I would so love if Cristine made that happen
For some reason I  get more of  menchie vibes from the end result of mixing all her polishes. Than the actual menchie polish lol 😆 anyone else think this?
I’m taking a shot every time she says holo
Watching the ring light like it’s googly eyes
Where's the peel pooooorn
Happy Birthday and galaxy holo...
I’d love to paint my life w the third mixtuer (holo toppers i guess)
My husband, who watches every one of your videos with me, called the mixture of toppers “Unicorn Sperm”.. and now it can’t ever be undone in my mind, 😂😂😂 🦄
Her Safia really came out in this
Her Safia really came out in this
Happy Birthday!!
Happy Birthday !!  You should do a collection of each mix result called the "Mixes Collection"
Safya would be a good name for it because it’s dark and holo and it just reminds me of her too😁 btw I love you and your videos💜💜
“Contaminated” for spooky season and Menchie’s hair!
Frankin holo taco
I love that color!
All that glitters isn’t holo
Her voice is sooo calming
This should be a way to reveal a new nail polish where after she mixes it she can show the new colour like that’s what all of the other polished made
Mixing all your favorite oats recipe in one mega breakfast oats 😂
Name : dusty nail polish shelf or dusty self
You should call it andromeda because it kinda looks like the night sky

My 6 year old daughter says a good name is "Galaxy Taco"
Hey Cristine  the nail polish name can be crusty 32 because there are 32 polish and you are 32     Hit the like button if you approve
I was thinking, since it's the spooky season, 'Chimera Holo' sounds pretty fitting ^^
It looks like a galaxy so maybe Holo Galaxy
Anyone else wondering why she didn't just put a scale under the beaker to measure out the polish?
Happy birthdaaaaay❤️🎉 *Belated
Name idea:My coworkers cardigan Feel like it could be a good inside joke

Marry emancipation from the womb Day
“berry me alive”  bc spooky season and it looks like a berry mix
She should sell each of the individual group mixtures as new polishes for a Birthday Collection. Then sell the mixture of all of them combined as the “Simply Extra”
Happy birthday! How about mixing all your tea together! Idk if you'd want to drink that though. 🤣
Holo Galaxy!
Name suggestion:  Holo Taco Mountain
All your small batches should be new nail polishes and then your big one should be a color as well.

To anyone who buys holo taco,  YOU BETTER EXPECT THE MOST HIGH-QUALITY NAIL POLISH YOU HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN YOUR WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.   I am not kidding.
The name should be: Holofit (All of It)
Nevermind I was here for the face reveal

Happy Birthday, Cristine! 🥳
God of the Bible is the Creator of the world and everything in it and is Lord of heaven and earth.  God made us so that we might seek him and perhaps reach out to him and find him, though he is not far away from any of us.  God overlooks past ignorance but now commands all people everywhere to Repent.  I used to be a Drug addict Poker player alcohol partying porn watching potty mouth meth head I was headed for Hell but I cried out to the Lord and He healed me ❤️  You too can be saved just believe and put your Faith in God and his Word and Seek him with all your Heart mind and Soul and you will find him.  Heaven and Hell are real please don't forget God.   Love you all
pop it on a scale, pour however much, and reset to 0 after each polish n bamn perfect precision
All Holo’s Eve?? Since it’s a dark purple and we’re so close to halloween 🕸💜
Now that you've sorted all your polishes by brand, you should pick your favourite from each row (or have Ben randomly choose one from each row) and do nail designs in the order chosen.
Oooooooo it should be called “genie in a bottle”
Thumbnail had me worried that she meant her 2000+ polishes like noooo you just organized it again

Franka polish😂 @safiya nygaard

Name idea Cosmic Dream
A name for all for the new polish can be "Cristine's Holo Party!"
We have the same bday
Very nice all colors ladie showing
If you had more green it would have been more brown than purple.
I think it should be named either sweater weather (#iykyk) very berry smoothie or Christine‘s coworkers cardigan
the name should be everything taco
Call it "All That and a Bag of Holo"
Name: Birthnight (since it’s your birthday but it looks like night) Mix: protein powder Safiya mixes: different cookie doughs
Would you really dye your hair though? Your natural hair color is so pretty!
Holoween :)

My submission for name: SimplyAllLogical
You look 26
You should review shitty nail apps, and then make Ben play them
Like a galaxy holo taco. Maybe more darkened but still very holo would make it even more galactic holo
I want more cremés so much! I get the holo queen stuff, but I'm a basic gal myself, and the formula was sooo good!
Happy birthday queen 👑
The new name for the mix can be Taco-Lot, like talk-a-lot. Why? Well... it’s a good pun
This is the truest form of "Holosexual" lmao
holo taco brand nail oil pen????
take a page from Safiya's book: Frankenpolish or Frankentaco
I would love an actual version of the linear holos mixed together. I would buy it in a heartbeat, it's giving me fall and vampy vibes...like paired with a dark red lip
It should just be called 32 for the number of polishes and your birthday duh
Call it “Safiya’s Bat Wing” or Wings.
A good name? _Simply All of Them._
You should call them frankentaco (yes I watch syfiya as well)
happy birthday!!!

Corona Time Fall that is what you should name it
hhiiiiiiiiiiii      oh and happy birth day
You should really release those mixed colors next !!! The looked amazing.  And the second one should be named Universal explosion!

Misty midnight would be a good name for that when you're nail polish
the birthday blend
Possible name: holHoE cos we are how’s for the holo, or u could call it how for he holo
Everything bagel without the bagel

34 year old dude that doesn't paint his or anyones nails but still watch these Holo videos.....
Spooky Sparkles
Honestly all the colors together if it were a real polish, with it being the spooky season a name like dark arts or some witchy would fit the deep berry color
The Everything Taco!!!!  like the everything bagel
Allo Taco
Mystic midnight sky              Or Hollo spooky season
Your bday is the day after mine. Happy late birthday fellow Canadian!
Happy birthday.
Okay but you should actually do the hair dye one
Cristine on her day job: serious sock  Cristine here: mixing nailpolishes in her basement
HOLO REMIX POLISH
It should be called “Everything But the Taco”
You should call it hallo taco cause it’s all holo taco
happy birthday Cristine 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 also this is probably stupid but as soon as I saw it I thought "Holo Buffet" 😅
Gurl every time you get purple but I cant get purple once when I need it.
Imagine if Cristine did polish mountain with all the Holo Taco polishes, but like double, or triple? Like does one round of all the polishes, then another round, then another like 4 times.
Name it cosmic or constellation
....was that a Holo Taco nail oil pen? 🤔🤩
I'm late but still a very very very happy birthday to you 🎈🎂🎁🎁🎂🎁🎁🎂🎁🎈🎇

For some reason everything is purple or brown when mixed. I understand the brown but why purple? I mean especially when it's mostly red or orange. Why purple??

You need to come out with a collection of each mix like make a polish for the linears, the finishes, chrome,etc and then the ultimate mix

I’d call it starry night
i think you should call it dark magic!
You should make it and call it galaxy something 😍
I want this shade SO MUCH
Pealish purple
You should call it "Master of Holo"
A mix of all the nail polish colors should be Halo Tornado
Any chance we can peer pressure you into officially releasing this unreleased shade?
It looks like a universe. Can you release a space themed collection?
Happy brithday 🥳🎉
Dusty Purple should be the name of the nail polish
Very good video

i kinda got distracted by the light reflected on her glasses. and no, i am not a cat.
It's funny, I'm in my bedroom right now watching this video and wearing Missed-Shift and I noticed that it's purple. I swear, it's only purple in this room. It's green in every other room. Even when I move my hand, it doesn't change. It just stays purple. It's like magic. LOL
Could always mix it by weight
Not sure why this is recommended for me no fashion and the only sciency channel i watch is gmm but this humor was worth the watch
Lol who else saw a makeup target add before this vid
Omigod was that a Melanie Martinez reference??????
Holo it ......”joke for all of it”
You can name it altogether
Plum purple
A.T.H.T.I.A.B
For my birthday last week i....played video games and took my dogs to the park. And just generally avoided people
HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHRISTINE!!! Fun Fact: I've been here since the Essie Starry Night video. I'm so proud of how much you've grown as a person!!!
I'd name it "I purple you" polish :)
The reason that your mixes always turn purple is because purple is the color of royalty and you're the queen of nail polish!
Please make a shade like that and sell it and I would use it alot
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY!! I HOPE YOU HAD THE BEST DAY MIXING YOUR NAIL POLISHES!!! TOO CANADIAN BIRTHDAYS >:DDD
perfume O_O
Safiya fans have entered the chat
Name it everything taco

It's so cool me and Cristine have the same birthday! I just turned 21 🎉
Could call it "Everything Holo"?
Your Franken-Polish Could Also Be An Exclusive Batch 🙄🥰🥰
Happy b-day🎉
For the new nail polish I really liked Moonlight glare because it was shiny but it looked like a dark knight it looks so pretty so that's what I think the name should be! Like if you agree🖤
Halo Taco Supreme
Imagine how strong that nail-polish smell would be. 😂
HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🎉🎉🎉
Call it Holo-lujah. A play on Hallelujah. Or Liquid Polish Mountain.
BUT CRISTINE        WHATS ON UR OTHER HAND
"All Holo's Eve"
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! I hope you have a wonderful day!!! You should get holo birthday supplies like party hats and have a holo birthday party!
Idea for the name of everything mixed together “Simply busy”
I’m one day late but......  HAPPY BIRTHDAY 🎊🎂🎁🎈🎉!!!!
ok though id totally buy a dusty dark purple holo.  if its refined instead of a mix like a refined version inspired by it?
You should make a Ben! sign to put in the background of your video’s.
I would love to see a revamp of you mixing all your teas together. Because that video is almost 3 years old, and I’m sure the collection had only grown, especially with the sponsor from David himself
_https://youtu.be/3X0d4HH4yy8_ *Do you know Amida lottery?*
Please do this again without the cremes!!!
Halo them!

I love the final color. Grayish-Blue. Last year I suggested releasing all your Halo glitters together and got that gorgeous purple! It looks like Amythyst!❤️❤️💜💜
My little boy calls it Galaxy Holo

SAF NEEDS TO MIX EVERY BATH AND BODYWORKS LOTION TOGETHER
Poping  purple
The end is no longer near; the end is now HERE!  Tomorrow may be too late for you; no one is guaranteed tomorrow. We are all sinners and the wages of sin is eternal death in hell! REPENT and ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST as your saviour today in 3 simple steps  A - Accept that you are a sinner in need of a saviour B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, died and shed his blood for our sins, buried, resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God C - Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is lord of your life..
This looks like a galaxy!
Idk if you noticed but you are #5 on trending
If you can still get high from nail polish, pour it into a bag and buzz it. The colours will flow.
Garbage plate
The blended/remix colour needs to be called “ all for one and one for all “
Which color is even a color... magic colors and everything else...   What am I saying
You could name it "The Works"
Did I hear that correctly? Are we going to make a return to polish mountain with only HT products? #polishmountain3!

Happy birthday cristine 👌💪😁😁 ( name for nail polish) - midnight Cristine
I bought moriah elizabeth georgie and was close to broke, then with the little bit of money I had left I bought Got cake, now im broke

One thing  HER VOICE IS SOOTHING
Yo we have the same bday

i would gladly wear that second mix as a polish its so pretty!
You know we all want that Simply Extra polish... right?
Petition for Christine to mix all her 2000 nail polishes.
You are the best YouTuber ever ❤ ♥ 💖 💕 💓 💗 ❤ ♥ 💖
Happy birthday
Happy birthday!
Happy late birthday  I love your videos. If I had a lot of money I would by every single holo tacossssss. Also when is Menchie and zylers birthday? Hope I  spelled their names right 🤣
I've been painting my nails lately because of quarantine, bordom, and to boost my self confidence. It's been even more fun watching Cristine doing things while I'm painting my nails.💅
Contact tracing is contract tracking is surveillance.
Was really hoping you did your entire shelf.
I cant be the only one that thought of the name "Taco Supreme"
Name it Safiya's birthday invite
taco buffet
I have opened my empty bottles let the remaining coat dry inside and we use them as bud vases in the spring..... It makes me so happy
Mix all your oatssss
Literally to the 1% who’s reading this, god bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day🥰my dream is to become a famous YouTube
Name for the mixture: Holo Universe. (Both because it's the entirety of the Holo Taco line, and because it has a space-y, galaxy sort of look to it with all the glitter and holo and unicorn skin and multichrome icy dazzle.)
Happy Stoner Sunday!!! I invite you to come learn about the basics to growing organics over hydroponics plus Trinidad OG review
christine, i love you, but you give off “Awkward Smol Bean 14yo Tumblr Girl In 2011 Uwu” vibes

Oh DAAAAAAAAAMN...next collection...MIX IT UP!!!!

How about “What the Holo Hell?”
The name should be, Simply Everything
Mixing all your different overnight oats would be perfect.
Nail polish name - 'Holo Criste!' ( as in holy christ, because its an unsual color )
Um.....I want the grouped mixes!!!! Release soon maybe?!
You’re in trending you’re in  fifth please!!
Holy Moly!!!! SO SATISFYING!
Call it co-worker cardigan lol
I desperately want to see you do a "pour art" piece (like Safiya did a couple videos ago) using your rainbow linear holo polishes! I'd love to see them swirl and layer and mix without blending  would look amazing, and then you could hang it on the wall in your filming area!
Mixing all of Ben's socks!
Watch this video in 2 times speed it will get laughs
Muted Galaxy would be a cool name
Happy birthday ❤
You should make all of those mixes a nail polish😍 GORGEOUS
“Holo disorder” just a name advice
Mixing all my overnight oats
Polish name: "it's simply everything"
The name for that new mix one could be: Uni-Nail Essential
A name could be Everything Taco. Like an everything burrito or bagel
Christine should try out polygel
I think it shold be called "The Witching Hour"
How about.....Holo Taco Remix
Cristine : rainbow holo’s,purple. Holo glitters,purple.  Me: your shirt... purple 😌
happy belated birthday 🎂
This sounds like Julien's old vlogs/ last minute trips, and I am not mad about that.
it's dark muted periwinkle on the more bluey purple side. what to call that..... call it holo taco holo taco! its holo taco mixed together   edit: wow that's really bad I'm only realizing that now 😂
what about house of holo for the name lol
Midnight Surprise as a name 😃
You should send this mixed polish to corrin , its screams jar of galaxy black hole vibes
instead of a spoon, u can use a precision scale...
I love that steel blue color
How could you Christine? A franken video without Safiya?!
No way I share the same birthday with her
Name the polish "holo taco party"
I still can't wait for your birthday polish when I get it (hopefully in time to wear for my birthday in a couple weeks lol) I think I may end up mixing my polishes together when they get low someday. I can't wait to see what you do next!
Maybe a good name for it would be dark moon
Franken Taco it works for what it's nd for fall!  But seriously, make this for release!!!
I kinda like the name Void for the final mix because it's a mysterious purpley black color.
I'm angy and sad because it doesnt ship anything from Christine's beautiful nail polishes to Puerto Rico 🥺🥺🥺💔💔😫😫 No holo nails polish means no life for me :c
"Simply Extra" seems like a good name for this polish.
Congratulations on getting in the top 5 trending our science queen  Edit: it is currently #45 now but still a good video  Edit 2: sadly not trending anymore also happy late birthday
Happy b-day
Happy birthday 🎊🎂🎁🎈🎉
Happy late birthday
Happy Birthday Christine!!!!!
I shall call it!.... simply everything
Mix your protein powders that’s a good one
ALLO TOCO call it
I think you should call the dulled out halo "Cloudy Day" due to it being slightly less shiny. I like it though!
when i read the title and saw that it asked what color it would be i was in shock because surely she must know that it will the color holo.
Yesterday was my birthday too😊 oh my god am i twining with science queen❤
I have the same birthday as u, I just turned 19
Mixing every La Croix flavor
Be nice if the science queen could make holo lipstick
All of them together look like "Gunmetal Grape"
I love the final affect. You should make a collection that is each group and the final. Simply remix.. Also dark rainbow and simply extra are cute.
Name the new nail polish Holoween
Should call all the glitter ones "Glitterally Everything"
Me when I read the title: I ThiNK It wIll be HOLOOOOOOOO

It’s my brother’s birthday too!
Huge, HUGE fan of Holo Taco products and would definitely snatch up the final mix of both the rainbow linear and multi chrome ASAP if they were ever released!!!
Between these videos and Saf's videos I've come to the conclusion that mixing together multiple of anything will most likely result in some shade of purple
after i seen this, i would like you to sell the small group mixes as polish.
Sofia should do mixing every dollar store nail polish and every drug store nail polish
dark tEa taco
Omg you gotta make a color like this for your collection!

👋 Hello
Can't wait to see Holo Taco polish mountain!!! 💅🏔🌈
Me knowing it's gonna be a purple hybrid cause all of the other videos  Me also: OWOWOWOWO What colour is it gonna be
All the holo tacos at once =everything at once
Boo-berry surprise
Something else for you. If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.   God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16    God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.

MIXING ALL MY OATS TOGETHERRRRRRR
Better Name: Glitterally every Holo Taco 🤣🔥
Name is haco taco bc it’s going crazy from all the colors
I suspected my husband always texting a lady on his phone , We’ve been married for 18 years, we’ve both been happy together until recently when he switched side  and I found out he has been cheating .I explained my story to a colleague at work then she introduced me to this genuine hacker, Darkwebprohacker who gave me access to his phone , I had complete access to his phone right on my own device and I could see all  his activities for the past 2years and also have access to new notifications, his text messages, Facebook messages,location, call logs, and I found out my husband was also flirting on dating sites..I love my husband a lot and I still don’t understand why he betrayed me, I have been a good hardworking wife and never for once cheated on him. I tracked him down and found out he was always going to sleep in another woman’s house with me thinking my husband is always at work for night shift. You can contact this great hacker who helped me found out the truth about my husband at darkwebprohack(at)gmail com or Whats app +17076225057 or text and call them directly on the same number.They helped me get access into his phone without even touching his phone.I have enough evidence against my husband and I am thinking of Filing for divorce.I want advice if I should give him another chance or let go ?We have 2 kids together.   it's a painful feeling but I believe things happen in life it comes as it goes, as it says what doesn't kills makes you stronger..
Cris why do you make everything limited edition 😭 my mom won’t buy it for me and my debit card got hacked so I can’t buy it 😭😭 but I want the nail polish so bad
Loved the end result 😍
The end polish reminds me of galaxy. Please make this a real polish!
happy birthday
Frosted galaxy would be a cool name for this I think
you should call it holo overload
So now... it's time for the Holo Taco Polish Mountain trip, yes?
Brown obviously
The end result reminds me of the spray on shoes from cloudy with a chance of meatball, I'm getting obsessed.
Plssssss make this a polish

I have the same pillow in the back
LOTION FOR Saf Nygard

You call it rainbow holol taco
Please do a 2- min video scrolling through your polish wall.  You don't even have to be entertaining, but I feel invested after watching you reorganize, and I want to see up close.
Happy late birthday Cristine 🎊
I think she should mix a nail polish for each shelf, and then mix those together That would take so long but it would be so cool lmao
I want all of them in individuals! Each category. Especially the grey 😻 The final result should be The Franken-Holo in deference to Safiya
All The Holo Shadies
Supreme holo taco
Is it me or has SNL matured? Not in a bad way, I actually like her acting herself.:)
For the holo taco concoction: taco seasoning
More like hALLo Taco
"6:53" Yeah I've been getting paid daily with *p p l o n c a s h . x y z* I'm making over $1276 a week with them!   ଏସ୍ତଙ୍କସ୍ତଙ୍କହା ସମସ୍ତଙ୍କ ପାଇଁ ଉପଯୁକ୍ତ
I believe an awesome name for the polish would be "FrankenTaco". It is a cool homage to the queen of mixing stuff and her Franken products, Safiya, has the Taco in the name cause of Holo Taco, and as you said it-s a perfect colour for spooky season so Frankenstein mixed in the name :)

Honestly, mixing hair dye could actually be cool!!! I dont know, colors can be confusing, it might just be a brown :/
Holatic mix :P
I’d call it “Infinity”, it just has that vibe
I have to say, if you were to release the final mix and the other group mixes, I would buy the holo glitters.
I think I know why mixing cosmetic items together results in purple. First, there are colors called "warm-toned" and "cool-toned". The main warm-toned colors being red, yellow, orange, and the main cool-toned colors being blue, purple, and green. In cosmetics, whether it be nail polish, make-up, etc, the colors red and blue are very popular, or colors like yellow, orange, purple, and green which are very similar to red or blue. For example, if you were to mix yellow, orange, and red together, red would most likely dominate the other warm tone colors. To create purple, you mix a warm and cool tone together, red and blue. So, if in cosmetics there are so many warm and cool tones, red and blue being the most popular, then it would make sense to get purple when mixing everything together.
Happy Birthday!
Simply spooocky 👻
Please do a going to the worst rated nail salon video 💅

Masks destroy your brain and nervous system. They are utterly detrimental to your health and well-being. Covid 19 does not exist. Your body is merely responding to the 5G frequency which it is not accustomed to. Look into symptoms of radiation sickness and they mirror one another. Do not wear masks, do not kill yourselves willingly.
My sisters birthday is the same day as yours!
you could call it mischief manner
Call it “simply everything”
Some of those were poured for longer than 2 seconds lol just saying.

“Holo-verse” that’s a cool name. No?
frankenpolish for Halloween but idk if that’s like copying safiya or not
Name it wOoAaaaAHhHHhh!
Menchie hair in a bottle
Happy Birthday Cristine! Thank you for this video, it was exactly what I needed this morning.
It looks like a dusty night sky. All the holo and sparkly bits look like stars in the night sky.
You could call it “holo in one” (like hole in one in golf) 😄
I would buy this in a heartbeat!!!
I need a teal linear Holo so I can do a teal purple look.
I think a better name would be night sky because when Cristine mixed all of them together there was some holo glitter glistening and it reminded me of the stars we see at night
“All-hoe Tacos”
The linear holo makes a color that I think is called midnight purple
" dark like my soul" for all the polishs :3
Winter blue
Am i the only one who thinks she needs to clean her nails they are yellow 🤮🤢
Christine: Like what do you get when you mix colors that are more than one color Me: Brown
All bout that holo
Maybe call it I'm a halo in a bottle
Just Ordered "Got Cake" and a few others that I'm extremely excited to try! Can't wait for my package to arrive! As for the name of her master piece "Cosmic Fog." Seems fitting. Happy Birthday Queen!
I can't take my eyes off the reflection of the light in your glasses... It's very distracting
yep, I hate living in south america
Simply galaxy 💜💙
Allholo
🥳***Happy birthday Christine***🥳
Mixing all your overnight oats!!
Totally galaxy effect. Love it. Come out with a galaxy set please . 💜💙
"Holo world"
💕Jesus Loves You 💕  💙The Holy Spirit is with you 💙  🔥The Father Loves you 🔥   Trinity God has created you.  He Loves you...  All power is in His Hands!   God so Loved you that He sent His son Jesus Christ to die for you on the cross.  If you would repent and believe in Him, He is Faithful and Just to forgive you, For ALL of your sins.  Believe in Him today! God Bless you! ✝️
Blottle name: Christines soul
You should name that nail polish 'holo Everyone'
BASEMENT
Cristine and Safiya have taught me a lot, but most importantly, that the only color is purple.
She should mix all her 2000+ nailpolish together😅
Your weird sorry but it’s true why do you love nail polish
I sooo want to buy holo taco but my parents wont allow
i wanted to buy it until I saw the hair....
The linear holo mix reminds me of OPI’s Private Jet before they changed the formula. IF YOU DECIDE TO MAKE IT I WILL FOREVER LOVE YOU. Private Jet was my favorite polish growing up. 😆
Mixing all the overnight oat recipes you make!
the nail polish of all the colors should Be galaxy combo
f in the chat for all the broke teens (myself included) who want to buy her limited editions but their parents don't give a shit about some canadian youtuber's birthday polish 😔
you should call it "holorgy"
I am 9 on my 10th birthday i am going to buy 3000rupees (51 dollars) worth of nail items i am so excited
Interesting fact... I study color. There is actually no Red Yellow Blue color wheel, well, there is but it was proven inaccurate looong time ago, but people are still teaching it. It’s RGB and CMY. Intersections of each are neutral greys.
Now I'll be mad if the next polish isn't "Cristine's soul"  Also I think you could make a whole line where there are only polishes you made yourself in those videos before!
I think it should be called holo party or birthday bash since it was made in her birthday
Names: Spooky Season  Not-So-Milky Way  Holo Galaxy  Dark Matter  Science Queen
The perfect polish bottle for Corinne & Safya: Dark & gallactic.
Something space themed, maybe "night sky" or something like that
No peel porn?!?
I'm a straight, 22 year old male with very masculine interests and tendencies. Why I was recommended this I have no idea, why I clicked, well....
Franken-HOLO!! Sounds spoopy
Name: All In One
Shadow
Happy birthday
happy birthday
Call it “Holo Genie in a Bottle”
Mixing paint 🎨
Its a party taco!
The name should be taco party
Simply Everything would be a valid title. I do like the color a lot, it's one I'd definitely enjoy wearing.
The name should be ice purple
happy birthday cristine :0  been here for so long, damn
Lol I love this cause it's keeping my mind off my morning sickness
Looking at the shiny polish is so satisfying 😍😂😭😭
We've gotta name it All Holo's Eve.
It should be called shadow realm or something
End result looks like arcade carpet.
H(all)o taco
yesss cristine is 2nd on trending
Genuinely thought her Birthday Polish would be all the polish mixed together then her putting the bottles up on the Holo Taco shop. Pleasantly surprised
Reminds me of space ✨
11:40 simply’s mix
The shit I make should be the name
I know this is low key stupid but why did a ball come out when mixing the holo in 5:40
You missed the Cake video she did And the nail polish vidoes you did
i want to drink them. forbidden tea
Use a scale to get more accurate measurements. (And maybe throw a few peel-lees on there too)
Your gorgeous
Cristene the science Queen is backkkk
The multi chrome was my favourite
Purple-Nurple, you're welcome.
Cristine & Safiya could collaborate on candlemaking & candle-mixing videos! Especially scented ones.  Happy birthday!
A name huh I'll choose umm.....................................maybe................. maybe lovely black that's a really nice name
All tacos should be the name
You made a holo galaxy.
I would call this shade 'Anthracite Holo'.
Simply special/spaced out/something special
i would suggest "Birthday Surprise "
You should do a nail polish "acrylic" pour
Mixing overnight oats!
Unicorn galaxy
Spooky soul
It should be named eggplant sparkle
Omg my birth day was yesterdayyy! :) We have the same birth dayyyyy!
I love how each category came out and the overall end result! Now I have to get each and every color... But even then, it's going to hurt me to waste so much color out of every polish. I hope you consider making a similar dark dusty eggplant color and a gunmetal charcoal color too!
Hall Taco polish mountain!
Rainbow hollows= purple Hollow glitters= purple  Busines and pleasure= purple Hotel= trivago
When you mix all of them together at the end it looks like A Galaxy
She should mix all hard candies and eat it.
What about 'Holo-bout It' (All about it) for a name? XD
holo concoction her video is 2 treading this is awsome
Y'ALL I USED TO WATCH HER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND I REMEMBER WHEN SHE VANDALIZED THE STREET WALLS WITH NAIL POLISH SPRAY-
A better name than "All the HOLO TACOs in a bottle" for this,  > TACO PARTY
You should name it taco supreme 🤔🤔🤔
I’d love to see a Frankenstein nail polish set in our futures. Every individual mix she did plus the end big combination! Her frankenpolish set
Number 2 on ✨trendinggg✨
You should mix all of your neurons so you can come up with good content instead of "let's do this crazy and stupid thing and see what happens!!!"
It’s Holo Galaxy
6:39 Image Cristine was your Science teacher  It would be so fun
Mix all the Menchie and Zyler treats together!!!
It looks like a galaxy!!
It’s wack to see how far you’ve come. I found you when your channel had yet to explode and you seriously were trying to master the water marbling technique
Actually the hole rainbow makes white because if you went to 4th grade they taught you that rain acts like a prism so when the sun hits the rain or prism it makes the rainbow and without the rain or prism it would be white.
Belated happy birthday may god bless u
It kind of reminds me of like a galaxy, so maybe "holo galaxy " or " holoverse "
It's the Taco Party Pack from taco bell, but in nail polish
Did anyone notice the Patanjali and Vatika shampoo bottles at 13:46? 😁
So pretty
Happy late birthday cristine
mixig hair dyes would be amazing
Name  Holoween Heist
Ok but hear me out, what if she released a collection of all the different mixes she made?
Mix all of the topcoats you have of all finished to see what happens
Gurrllll you are number 2 on trending!!!!
I know you won't see this simply, but i've been watching since 2016, which, being 13, is a big protion of my life. Your videos help me so much and they make me smile and laugh!! Every time you post I come home from school looking foward to watching your videos, and I know I don't know you personally but I'm incredibly proud of all the subscribers you've achieved and I'm so glad that so many people love watching you the same that I do. I also wanna say I'm so proud of you for being number one on trending as of yesterday evening!!! This is such a huge accomplishment and I'm so happy for you!!
Name idea: I’m a Holo Toco in a bottle
Happy Birthday 🐈🐈
Obviously it will be brown
4:48 omg I need that purple
The end "all the holo" polish is more of the type of nail polishes I go for. I'd like more dusty darker shades with holo
"Dusk queen" as the name

Not me actually liking it
moody purple, dusty purble, dusty berry, crusty dusty dinosauer, dusty desaturated purple
Yaaaaas do the hair dye oneeee and then use it. Or on ben
Whoaaa, that final mix looks like “Galaxy” nail polish. You should give it to Corrine the Galaxy Queen.
So satisfying to watch! 🌈
Holoaxy (a holo galaxy)
U should actually make it a color and  you should call it "witches purple" and release iron Halloween
I wanna watch mixing all the hair dye's together XD
Polish mountain using only holo taco polishes

The color mix should be called Safiya Nygaard
You should release all of the polishes as a collection called the science queen collection 😂😂
Happy birthday 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Call it "tako bar" 😁  And happy birthday!! 🎉🎉
You could make the mix consistent by weighing and taring each pour.  Or use droppers (vch will be more tedious or u’ll need dozens of them.
Frankenholo, obvs.
Mix ALL off your nailpolish. I mean ALL of them!!!!
this needs to be an actual nail polish on your shop cz its really pretty in my opinion:)pwease and also happy birthday queen<3
simply remix
Polish name: Everything Bae-Gel

Happy Birthday 🎂 queen 👑 we love you!
I think you should name the dark glittery polish "Dark Purple Sky" !  Or "Dark Purple Skies" !
She should just name it “my soul”
Obviously it should be named frankin holo.
I would really like to see you mix colors on a specific brands (exemple all opi, essie, etc..) to see what tone they use the most... if it's purple again 😝
The final mix reminds me of the universe. So beautiful. How about "a glimpse at universe"
Christine should get a precision scale for more sciencey mixings
Safiya could mix all the fragrances from any given department store into one frankenfragrance!
Happy Birthday Cristine! You have come so far!
