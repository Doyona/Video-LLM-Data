wtf, I thought this is new video
Nope..
In Champions vi facciamo piangere 😢😢 sempre forza Milan ❤❤
TONALI WELCOME ❤
Best of luck Newcastle ❤ love from india 🇮🇳
le temps il est bien gris mdrrrrr quel climat trop nul
fuck Newcastle tonali is the Milan
Still cannot believe they sold him for 70M. This is the very worst signing this year. Shelvey is better player than this guy but the media did very good job for Tonali personally. They gave an way under average player a career and lots of money. (Milan fan)
Hang on! how short are Murf's shorts? The kit man has done him a dirty and given him the lasses bottoms. Howay man! I want to see his footy not his religion!
Looks like a very gud smart training session.....as a Villa fan, Im worried!😮
Those facilities need Man City esque upgrade   Ewwww 😏
He looks Happy😂😂
Hidup ya gini sandro rus dewasa kadang rus korbanin cinta nya pada Ac milan.. buat apa bertahan di milan klo gk diinginkan management...lebih baik cari suasana baru mumpung masih muda NEWCESTLE MASA DEPAN ANDA.. GK PEDULI SUKSES TAW GAGAL UDAH RESIKO..
Wow a football player with a Louis Vuitton toiletries bag. How original. Boring
Best luck for Sandro. ❤🖤
Love how he is old school, takes his training serious, even wears blacked out boots👌🏼 😏 gonna be absolute quality this year for the toon…from a Chelsea supporter.
SANDRO ⚒️
I'm Milanisti.. I remember when sandro first came to Milan he lacked confidence but in the second season sandro impressed
笑顔が増えてくれることを祈る
ahahah tonali capisce un cazzo li
💔💔💔💔
Tonali is Milan, Milan is tonali😭
Tonali é un giocatore molto forte… sicuramente meno tecnico di Andrea Pirlo , ma molto aggressivo
Tonali é un giocatore molto forte… sicuramente meno tecnico di Andrea Pirlo , ma molto aggressivo
Quality
Tonali ..Is Milan …Newcastle is only money
#SandroTonali #Tonali
Forza Sandro
Reviens à la maison Sandro 🔴⚫ Forza Milan
Karius😮
Steve bruce never saw this place
Nel nostro cuore sempre ❤️🖤 #Tonali
i thought i had milkbottle legs until i saw gordons lol
Milanello sunnier and better 😆
Come on Sandro! Always in our hearts! Come on AC MILAN! Come on NU!🖤♥
Will always be ❤️🖤
you know deep down he is not happy at all even with all the money he gets from it. thank you tonali for everything a true milanista you brought love grinta sweat and money to MILAN we thank you for that . forza milan forza tonali we will see you again after those 5 years for free ^^
Who do you think did the best in the bleep test? My money is on Miggy
I gotta ask, wtf is Dan Ashworth doing? Why is he not signing players for the first team but investing in youth when we are under FFP restrictions? He needs to back Howe, or come out and tell us what the hell is going on.
Tonali never smile
Sandro will not dissapoint you guys, mark my word
Wow Newcastle really do have a great team
Why he so sad 😂😂
SANDRO CI MANCHI ♥🖤
Young lewis Miley looks like he's in a dream - what an experience for a local lad.
He looks like Kylo Ren😂
Trattacelo bene Sandrino…💔🙏
They all seem super relaxed, and rid of any ego. This is amazing to see.
tonale does not want to be there
Sandro is not happy
Does Graeme Jones speak Italian? 😂
San Siro was much better
Free Tonali, let him go home.
All the money in the world doesn't buy happiness.
i can't see Tonali with other jersey it really hurts 💔🥺
Anybody Else heard the beeping noise?
tonali 😍😍
SULTAN ARABIA CLUB 🔥🔥
❤🖤
Che tristezza rispetto a milanello
In all fairness,he doesn't seem that bothered. Newcastle's midfield looks good for the season.
mi dispuace per voi è milanista
Sandro Tonali is a cracking signing for Newcastle. Could be a future captain at the club.
As Milan fans, it is the first time that I feel that a part of me dies with the departure of Tonali. 😔
Dear Toon Army please look after Sandro because he is someone who gives EVERYTHING. You have a gem of a player. Best of luck to the Toon.
chłop szczęśliwy, nie ma co xd
Fantastic to watch toon in training  Can't wait 4 theyre return 🤩👍
Madonna kylo ren Si vede che gli manca tornare al lato chiaro della forza non c'è bisogno di fare 100 video...
Love Sean wandering in like he's going for a kick about with his mates on the green! lol
I love you Sandrino
Tonali che ha scelto il NEWCASTLE così può bombarsi la Dilettona insieme a Karius :D
Omg, how cool was Guimaraes at the last season, really top. But i must to say, how incredible was Eddy How's work, all players had an increase in their level.
who will tonali bench is my question?
Miss you Tonal. Forza Milan forever
Did Newcastle signed KYLO REN?? OMG they gonna have a darkside of the force with them..
Tonali seems unhappy.
Buy Maignan the Goalkeeper of AC Milan
This season we see this beuatiful club in the CHAMPIONS LEAGUE!
بالتوفيق يارب 👍🇸🇦♥️
Sandro, cosa ti hanno fatto Sandro
Excited to see all players in a good state.
secondo me sto ragazzo non è felice li...
Vai Sandro! Vai Newcastle!❤️🖤
Thanks Newcastle, we robbed you ❤❤❤
Christ Botman is one handsome man
Vai sandro
Sandro Toonali :)
I could be wrong but his body language since joining strikes me that he won't be here very long.
I hope he doesn’t break his tonaili
Apparently Bruno's new hobby is fishing 😂
Sandro cuore rossonero per sempre..❤️🖤
😢😢😢😢😢 ciao Sandrino nostro!!!❤🖤
I think Tonali is just very, I’m also shy it’s hard to keep a happy face all the time if you’re feeling abit uncomfortable
I feel united will be found out and relegated next season .
I think Hitler smiled more than Tonali 💀
Matt Ritchie is a great professional, what a player he has been on and off the pitch for our club over the years
daje Sandrone, nonostante tutto un pezzo di te rimarrà nel nostro cuore
Sandrino ma che cazzo ci fai li con quella maglia addosso
English fans don't know Tonali at all you must know that he was like this in Milan too but when he plays football he becomes very aggressive, runs a lot and is strong both in the defensive phase and as an assist man AC Milan fans loved him and considered him the true Rossoneri heart. Tonali is a very good boy a serious professional who works and trains very intensely, many AC Milan players are not satisfied with the sale of Tonali
Tonali looks way happier than when he was in Milan  😅
Tonali Out
Upload Yesterday pre season game 2:3 highlights
He didn't smile at all, even in the happiest A.C.Milan moments...
Benvenuto nel club che ha vinto la coppa delle fiere tonali! 😂
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Anyone no what the best time is to see the players maybe catch them for a autograph at before or after training
I still Can’t believe tonali came to Newcastle. Well done to you guys. WHAT A PLAYER you have signed.   Build a team around him!!
토날리 지금 악몽일꺼임ㅋㅋㅋ  차라리 유벤투스라고 생각하셈 ㅋㅋㅋ
Noooo, scusate ma Sandro ha sbagliato indirizzo! Insomma, io, accesissima ❤️🖤, dovrò iniziare a seguire il Newcastle, in bocca al lupo per la Premier!
As an ACMilan fan I’ll start supporting Newcastle. And I know tonali does not seems to be happy but he’s just like that. He try to look professional. Of course wasn’t easy for him to leave Milan where he has all his family and friends but I can assure you that even if you watched tonali training with Milan he never smiled. He is a great and humble guy but focused on the game not joking around.
WE MISS YOU SANDRO 😔 🔴⚫️
Graeme letting Tonali know where the best full English in town is.
Bruno 🫂w
Newcastle you have to stop to ask Serie A's best players come to you. You have break the ball. You make a dirty play, All the world will hate you, and football will never be a sport
Tonali’s a good player, but I can’t believe how much people and the media are overhyping him.
Ma che cazzo ce fai là caro Sandro…. Sicuramente ti farà diventare ancora più forte a cazzuto questa esperienza in premier!
8:34 explaining that theres no pasta up north
this is a classic robinho moment
Tonali looks shy though
Fa male vederti qua sandro
The GK training compared to ever before makes me excited and smile to see how good the feet are getting, so much more, if you want to be top. Where’s DeGah going to end up? with Everton allowing some big Man U money to come in or is Inter all sealed? 3:49
2:23 don’t do the coaches though… not all lead by example… 2:23
Any chance of publishing the changes or even both sets of results from last year? Bet they are huge!
1:49 different soundings to last years tests! Slowly we get there together, if you ever want a head of construction finance & development 25 years worldwide with a Brazilian BFC Qualified Fitness Coach & Analysis; PT ex. Brazil Runner wife give Nadir & Kevin Millin a look up, they would love nothing better… 1:49
Povero Sandro! dove cazzo sei finito..
Non ci pensare Sandrino a fine mese quando arriva il bonifico il broncio te lo porta via. Forse a te rimane ma alla tua fidanzata no
Tonali🎉
Wow I love Tonalis smile, and it's great to see them all back in training
Where's isak,joelinton and miggy?
Dan burn is an absolute tank
That bleep test isn’t the multi stage fitness test as they stop? What is it?
Could no one lend Jacob Murphy some shorts? 😂 k
5:23 How do you not even congratulate Gordon on winning the Euros????
Tonali leg muscles beasty like 🦵💪💪, not quite grealish but near enough 😅
1) ASM is surprisingly in shape given the summer break! 2) Who was the very very young looking lad at the beginning the film? 3) More grey training gear. Come on lets be a bit more imaginative 4) I thought Grealish his shorts short, but Jacob Murphy has entered the chat 5) Isak is going to explode this season isnt he 6) Botman looks a million dollars
Newcastle gonna finish again in Top 4 Most Promising Club now outta UTD, Arsenal n Liverpool❕🖤🤍🖤 n I’m a Die Hard Man 👨🏼 City 🌃  Just less time wasting this season 👍
Sandro Tonali is similar to Pirlo, not smiling, save the smile... really Pirlo in private he's funny. I m an italian, I know good enough Tonali
Where is Tonali? donde sta? dove sta? Now, I ve seen
Hai voluto la bicicletta? Mo pedali!
😊สนามซ้อมโคตรเจ๋งอ่ะ
6:22 Tonali spinning bike with Raditya Dika.
Non league fodder scored two on u
I think Tonali and Guimarães is the key of the team
Newcastle will be a great team next season
0:42 bro who is this baby ? Taller than me.
Tonali doesnt smile , I knew him since was a young player .
United fan here, I just have a feeling Tonali will be such a revelation for the Toons. He'll probably be the signing of the season come the end of the season.
Hello looney toons
Beep test killer that
nah he's facial expressions is numb😂
Non vedo tonali così ! Perche quella copertina ! Milan e New castle sono 2 club completamente diversi ! Il primo leggendario il secondo ha tutte le basi per farlo ! Da un milanista saluti agli amici inglesi 🖤❤️
Toon? 🤣
Toon army
Tonali with the baller black boots
All these weirdo brands bare man trying to make cool😂
I fucking love Newcastle United... keep these awesome videos going!!
Not enough signings. We in CL common wake up call.
Sad man who never laughs, go back to Italy
As a Milan fan, I will definitely watch the English league when NU plays
How To Be Simply Saved.     1. The bad News. We are sinners. (Romans 3:23.)    We deserve to be punished in hell for our sins.     2. The Good News. Jesus Christ who is God’s Son died on the cross for all of your sins. He was buried & rose again to give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift. (1 Corinthians 15:3-4. Romans 6:23.)    3. How am I saved?       Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. (Acts 16:31.)     4. Once saved, always saved.   Jesus said in John 6:47.       Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.     Do you believe that you are saved by grace and promised heaven because Jesus died for you?            Yes/No
I hope castle champion
Eddie how bro you have to admit he pulled out one of the most clutches ever🗿🔥
He not happy dont wanna be there
My highlight was seeing Maxi walk through the training ground doors with a smile on his face. ❤️ We love you & wish you a great season 🎉
Minkia fa giá freddo a Newcastle 😂
I see a lack of belief in their eyes.
When you watch Milan training grounds etc it doesn’t even compare to this
I had newcastle fans.. 💪
Jacob Jacob Jacob, short shorts?
Tonali looks so sad 😢 I can understand him, going from a team like AC Milan to Newcastle is a huge hit to your stomach…
Poor Sandro, no squad number yet.
How is Gordon already back bro??
I wish there was someone who could speak italian so Tonali could find a relation in the training ground.
More of this content please
4:52 - Sandrino bestemmiando interiormente. Poi realizza che lo stanno filmando. 😂
He doesn't look so exited to be at Newcastle
As a Milan fan and a Tonali's fan, I will start following Newcastle the next season. You gained one more supporter! ;)
Tonali just looks like he wants to snap someone.
didn't know wilson speaks italian xD
Tonali really love black Attire's
Tonali didnt want to leave his childhood club but this should be a change for him a new playstlye a new league and new players
Cloudy and windy on his first training day 😂 you couldn't make it up 😂
He's tormented Send him back to his home 🔴⚫
3:36 the height difference
Un grande in bocca al lupo Tonali ti auguro di vincere il campionato.
as a chelsea fan, i have to say.. Newcastle's squad looks dangerous...
Seems everything is getting better & better & better day by day - almost easy to forget the decade & a half of deterioration now
Who can hear PacMan eating stuff?
Why one leg pulled up on shorts for everybody?
Tonali is loving the weather on the first training day
They could film the lads having a dump and I’d still watch
Impressive to see Anthony Gordon back in training just a few days after winning the U21 Euros. Also Tonali and the Brazilians: not been long since they last played.
Tonali is not happy
Iask,Tonali,Botman My 3pick
Good to see Tonali train
New castle should be more active active om transfer market... If they want to keep the position they r right now which is top 4... Considering Liverpool and Chelsea r strengthening... Players like Sean longstaff, wilock should be on sale, Wilson, joelington should be on 2nd choice from the bench...  They need more quality players in midfield... Considering they r playing 60 games this year , let alone injury....  Eddie howe did a great job, but let's be honest , if he can't keep up with the hipe, he will sacked sooner than later...  New castle have money and it's a bit frustrating they are not pushing the limit after a month and half of transfer market...
I wonder how money can change those players with King Salman's foundation 😂😂
How is this for commitment Gordon back already and looks like he's enjoying every moment
Udah gak sabar pengen liat aksi"nya di UCL musim ini... # TOON ARMY # # THE MAGPIES #    💪💪💪💪🇮🇩🇮🇩
People forget Tonali is only 23 it’s a massive thing moving away that young. He’ll soon love it when there’s 50,000 chanting his name
Champions League,, just 1 player IN???
Newcastle utd be a work hard for Champions league and premiere league
Stand when you shake a hand Ashby. These youngsters 😂
Fabian scar is my fav  defender 🔥
He will be back in Italy next season . Historically italian players go back or stay in Serie A
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Bruno asking for fishing spots cracked me up
Tonali and Miggy on the bikes makes me think of an actor with a stunt double
ننتظركم الموسم القادم 😍👏
I just think Maxi should be training.... (Sarcasm)
Why the fist punch greetings? Have you banned handshakes?
Love it ❤
FORZA SANDRINO❤🖤
Brilliant seeing the lads back it brings so much happiness to hundreds and thousands of fans across the world, I wish everyone at the club nothing but a healthy and successful season ahead. Up the Mags and a very special welcome to Sandro and his family and friends these lads will run through brick walls for you these are your new brothers in arms. 🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍
Welcome tonali 🎉🎉
Idk why but I’m just rooting for them. They seem to be doing things right and look at them now.
Ritchie seeing if Anderson was feeling ok after the bleep test, Gordon and Wilson starting a bromance, Tonali and Miggy chatting to each other in god knows what language coz it aint English, Bruno letting people know he's been fishing, Schar got his end away the night before coz he cant stop smiling, i fukn love my club man up the toon
Dude moved there by unbelievable money. Milan saw something shocking from the Arab owners. Welcome to the Premier league.
Bruno wants to gan to Fontborn, pay the quid for the tagged fish. N chill out on the dam wall thinking about smashing the league
Good to see the lads back & looking forward to seeing them in the pre-season games!
Every new player we have signed has appeared as Tonali did in this video at first, a little bit awkward. Botman and Gordon spring to mind, now they are both big parts of the group.
I see Jacob Murphy forgot his shorts and had to play in his undies lol
Welcome back, Mr.Gordon. The Champion.
Tonali doesn’t want to be here 😂
So first day back in training. Have the cleaners been off too, that carpet could of done with a quick blast from the Dyson
i guess you could say its back
Amazing to see the difference in the two groups. In the second group all were in A1 shape except Callum was carrying a bit of weight. The first group was the opposite, with Sean Longstaff & Jacob Murphy looking fit and Matt Ritchie looking A1. I’d put Ritchie in group 2 & give group 1 some hard workouts.
This video has made me grin more than any in a long while.
I’ll take you fishing Bruno, any time, anywhere!
トナーリかわいそう
I've missed them so much!!, Cannit wait for the season to start.
Who will be Tonali’s Teqball partner? 🧐 🤔
tonali & miggy🤝
I love these training videos
5:00  6:08
Toonali !!!!! When I saw big Joe and tonali running side by side... I squealed like bobby hill!!!
Imagine Shearer had come through the ranks at his beloved club, got to play for his country, adored by all his fans and then at 23 they call you in and tell you you've been sold.  Tonali is going to take some time to adjust to what has happened, luckily once the games start and he realises exactly what the club is about, along with the fact that he will develop as a player in the top and hardest league in world football, he will have smiles across that face all the time, every day.
Hopefully the lads make Sandro feel at home, he'll love the toon a few games into the season 🖤🤍 HWTFL!!!!
Miggy rocking a new full sleeve
I bought the streaming “ticket” for the game against Gateshead and will be watching from Greenland 🇬🇱 come on you maggies 🖤🤍
So nice to see longstaff back out there
Bruno wants to go fishing. What's a good place ??
FC Arab money. Fc anti football
We dont have a left back , centre back and creative player surely our transfer window is not over yet. We are over celebrating Tonali lets buy more players we are in the UCL man😭
Sandro ❤🖤
1958
See yous tomorrow boys👏🖤🤍
0:03 whats that tracker tonali has in his hand called anyone pls ?
Tonali is a fantastic addition to the squad.
Can we all admit that Tonali wishes he was still back in Milan
Everyone got most excited about the second group that trained let’s be honest 😂
He just doesnt want to be there. 😂😂😂
Sandroooo Sandroooo
Did Murphy get his training kit a size too small or has he been smashing the gym? 😂
Do you sell that illuminated sign at 24 seconds?? If so where and take my money.
Get Bruno a rod and take him off Warkworth Pier as the mackerel come in  😀🐟🎣
Maxi in the drip 🥶
Tonali that must have been an experience listening too Graham Jones !!
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE BABY.
Some seriously top class players in this Newcastle squad, they'll be challenging for top 4 again and let's see how they get on in the UCL
Rangers fan here. Excited to welcome you guys to Ibrox on Tuesday. Hope to see Tonali play as he is a player I really enjoyed watching before he came to you.
Just love Bruno, such a nice guy!
Great to see the lads back lets hope they all have a great season with good health and great rewards CMON THE TOON!
Sandro is definitely not at home….he has been chased away from Milan by those American assholes. I wish he will find happiness even there in Newcastle. The weather is not the best feature of Newcastle as I can see.
Get gazza to show bruno some fishing spots 😂😂😂
Let's go!! I actually getting good nausating feeling. Like disbelief that we are in champions league and our team looks solid, mexican from USA fan since goal 1 rhe movie came out!
The legend that is Pauli Dummett 💯
Esperava chegar mais jogadores.Pelo menos um lateral esquerdo.
Jerry man im sinking
Eu te odeio Newcastle
Were massive!!!!
I demand to know who the Ace of Base fan is. Tune!
Ci credo che Sandro è triste ..😒ma avete mai visto il centro sportivo del Milan ? Li sembra di stare ad un funerale..
Love these types of videos!! Can't wait for the new season!!
We need to buy another italian player to help Tonali settle in. We need Chiesa or Bonucci.
welcome to boot camp, I got sick watching it
i'm a new newcastle fan thanks to tonali, as im since always a fan of ac milan, go Magpies!!
Neanche un tifoso al primo allenamentoa che è ahahaa...poi tonali e la ragazza guardavsno gli spogliatoi wow wow ...ma vuoi mettere Milanello ahahaa bella scelta sandro
At last! Welcome back wor lads❤
Why's Gordon always so tired 😂
Someone find gazza so bruno can go fishing😂
Great to see them back 🖤🤍
Going to miss him 🥲
We're coming harder
Love the behind the scenes footage, excited for the season to start! #TTBWA
Great to see all ❤
I could watch videos like this all day ⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️
This kids gonna be fire 🔥 I can feel it boys
Sign  Scott mctomi
Bruno randomly asking for a place where he can go fishing. 😅
Love it how Bruno's talking about fishing he did on his vacation
Can't fucking wait to see the boys back in toon hwtl
Sick of seeing people talk about him not smiling for the love of god can you imagine what it's like for him to see this it must be like when you get a new job or new school but the whole world judgeing you
Training ground looking pristine
So great to see the guys back and preparing for a very exciting season. I hope Tonali and his girlfriend settles well and quickly.  I’m coming to Newcastle for the first time from abroad to watch a game. Already bought a ticket 🎟️🤗
Hell of a tan on Mileys right leg.  I'm really excited by MIley though.
He doesn’t want to be at this small oil club
2023-24 premier league winners right there 🖤🤍
Excellent !
tOnAlI rEgReTs hIs DeCiSiOn He So SaD 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
News in sweden today. My alltime favorite magpie Nolberto Solano has been announced as afc eskilstuna new manager. They are playing i the swedish second best division. And currently in the bottom 2 in that division.
Poor Gordon had like a weeks holiday😅
Massive smile on my face watching this.
This is an interesting insight. Can't always be easy coming to a new club, different culture, climate etc, especially as a big signing. Looked a bit lost at times, sure he'll settle in well though.
Tonali looks like the kid who joined the class midway thru term, bless him. Can't wait to see him play in the black and white, he'll fall in love with the club and the City in no time once he experiences match day at St James' ❤
This club supports the total subjugation of women and girls. Sickening.
Great content
sandro tonali only knows how to say hello to someone.
Who won the bleep test??
Wor team! Good to see them back.
Get a few more in for some of the pre training then i can relax
I feel like a kid again watching that , it’s so exciting we are back in more ways than one !!!
Up the Geordies come on let’s frighten the premier league with a couple of more signings ⚽️⚽️⚽️⚽️👍
I could watch this shit all day
Someone tell bruno we have some belter places to fish man, one of the best coastlines in the country. Probably catch a trolley as well like but thats just the beauty if the North east. Cant wait for the season man🖤🤍🇮🇹🤌
I definitely saw Tonali smile at least 2 or 3 times
Can't wait to see NUFC playing UCL.  Wednesday nights at SJP 👌🏼🔥🔥
Great to see the boys are back in too
Some serious ptsd from secondary school PE here
Tell Bruno to go up Fontburn. Some decent trout in there.
I think tonali is gonna be in for a big shock tbh now once prem is underway
Howay the lads 🙌 The boys are back in toon 🏴🏳️🏴🏳️🏴🏳️🏴🏳️🏴🏳️🏴🏳️🐜
Dude’s smiling all the time now he’s getting down to work
Jesus loves you.
The thumbnail deserves 1mil views, these guys are trolling everyone 😂😂
Miserable git
Training ground looks amazing ❤ great time to be us.... Long time coming
Love seeing the lads stretch to a cheeky bit of 'Genie in a Bottle' and 'Waterfalls'. My kind of lads.
Finally been waiting for this video all week 😅
Казахстан за Нюкасл
LOVE IT!!!!!!!❤❤
Great signing......bit surprised not brought more in for the start of pre season though, should be nowhere near FFP
See Toon-Ali On The 12th From The Gallowgate End...  ...Howay The Toon Army...
Ciao Sandrino, bonny lad! 🖤🤍
Tonali will be a top 5 player of all time
Whoever made tonali not smiling as the thumbnail knew what they were doing😂
