can you teach us how to build a honey escalator? don't just show us a building and expect us to be happy. edit: nvm. you already told us.
If you see this stuck to the wall and it will be as just as possible for people to understand٫ and if people had their life last longer٫ and you're able to see this at once.
I love how hes demonstrating how the ender pearl elevator is faster than the horse cake ladder, while it's obviously a lot slower than the horse cake ladder (and more expensive too)

It’ll take longer to get to build limit this way, but you can also do a 3 by 3 spiral staircases “that way you can put a giant Pilar in the center” with landings at each of the corners so that you don’t have to aukwardly move left while turning right.
Hi
a boat will despawn after 3 hour though
I subscribed with my left ring finger

Ah yes use cakes instead of water elevator to get my horse up my bridge
How many times did skip say "Staircase"?
Why so many slab jokes on 27

Meaning Mumbo Jumbo : *breathes in redstone*
Yeah I’ll just stick with regular stairs…
I subbed with my left ring finger 🙃🙂
ah yes that *pesky* breathing, so annoying 🙄
I WROTE this my left ring finger on mobile.
Weird to make cake, where to that iron bucket go…
i lick this caol but you sode see my caol
0:24 Ok i unsub on my left ring finger.
Huh, what about a ladder
me when doing a mine i do a 3x3 staircase and in the middle i put a water hole  and after some time i put rails and take a minecart
I have auto jump turned on for maximum efficiency
Skip: "You don't need to worry about that pesky breathing"
Ok Now I'm Subscribed...  Again, I Guess.
My shopping mall build was needing a slow escalator, thanks for the inspiration!
In the first water stair you can use that special stone that makes water pump upwards under the watersources and then you can just press w
Stair
6:12 We on Education Edition have to use freaking shovels for the boat.
carpet is smallers fences hit box
I like elevators more/ they only take a little bit of time
Do these tricks work on I phone or I pad?
You can also make a 2x3 spiral staircase.
“Nobody has subscribed to the channel with their left ring finger” Me who types very fast : hehe boi
It’s so good
Sad I didn't see a 4x4 spiral staircase, I have 1 that works but I was hoping for a better design
What about tp
MC builders: “NO YOU CANT GO UP WITHOUT A STAIRCASE!!!!” Me, a Chad: “haha scaffolding go brrr”
Bro the honey block automatic one is literally just a minecraft escalator.
Why do you use pokemon music
Also using the crawlspace if you place a slab and a trapdoor above you still crawl if u want a part 2 of this
Instead of going down the 1x1 Trapdoor Spiral Staircase you can put water at the bottom and drop :)
"no person has subscribed to the channel with their left ring finger" *shows a clip of some subscribing with their left ring finger cutely*
Skip: "no one has subscribed with their left ring finger" guy in vid: *subscribes with left ring finger*
Haha
You can go down the middle of the 1 by 1 staircase with water at the bottom
Stairs+space fastest walk
Plottwist: just unsubbed with my ringfinger

1:02 auto jump
.

me always unsubscribing and subscribing every time i watch your videos
Fun Fact: If you climb up an staircase block with auto-jump on, you will climb up faster.
7:55 no the obvious choice is a bubble elevator smh
All of these weird staircases, when I just use bubble elevators lol.
I think you mean the digiti annularis
It's easy for me because I'm left handed
the reason for the carpet and fence/wall thing is probably that the player cant reach above the fence but when there is a carpet it droops of the edges allowing the player to climb up and over
0:17 I DID IT
What do you mean nobody used their left ring finger to do it I just did a few months ago
How many times he said the word "staircase"
0:19 pause there. for the like 1MILLIONTH time it’s easy to tell you just inspected it and changed it. you should have Atleast changed “current subscribers” to “how people subbed” YouTube doesn’t even have a how people subbed so just stop you know your deceiving little kids right?
"nobody has used your left finger to sub" YOU JUST DID IT.
If your subd shud you unsub and sub with your left ring finger?
You can go faster on staircase when your sprinting spam the space button i do this a lot in my mines
13 min starcases

smoothest way to y256
You can’t really crawl in bedrock but I do have one way : if you put water then a one block hole then swim and tada crawling
3:35 I think that's easy to explain: fences and walls have hitboxes that are 1.5 blocks tall, but not the entire block in width, and carpets have a hitbox that has zero height and the width of 1 block, so you can jump on the wider carpet and then walk onto the 0.5 blocks higher fence or wall
i subed with my left ring finger
Lets make this this the most liked comment
Mumbo be like when he's not doing redstone: I cant do redstone :(
or.... a ladder?
3:38 well the carpet is further than the fence hitbox and the carpet hitbox is as high as 1 block so to me it’s logical for minecraft
mTV stairs lol
Almost at 5mil skip the tutorial! 🤩
0:20 I unsubbed with my left ring finger so haha I think that counts     ...and resubbed with a toy lightsaber somehow...

I hit the like button with my cat, all my toes, my knee, my forehead
11:45 climb up to the top to find out who asked
Just a random fact: To get full emerald beacon, trading with fletcher by 32 stick for 1 emerald, you need 47 264 sticks.
The reason you can jump over fences with carpets is because the carpet doesn't go up on all sides, only the middle where the fence pole is on. So you can jump over the carpet
Art:*S T A I R*
Dude
Or, the easiest, a ladder!

7:00 I will be using that on my ultra hardcore XDDD
Why can’t you make ender statis in bedrock. Because the ender pearls can’t stop flying around a touching blocks
Carpet on fence makes sense because normal fence is 1.5 blocks tall which we can’t jump but when we put carpets on it makes the jump required to get up smaller since the carpet is low making it jumpable with carpet. Yeah Minecraft is weird
I don’t know what a ring finger is
I thought there were only 7 stairs Oak birch spruce cooler oak jungle warped crimson
But it’s 😮good  😊
Lol I use the pillar
ring finger subscribe is a bit hard

plant a jungle tree and just keep cuting it into stairs, also a pretty quick way for "farming" wood
Now we all KNOW there will be some red stone major who spent their entire brain to minecraft, which i could never get the red stone of, who ends up figuring out the worlds HARDEST way to make a staircase
I did it
Too easy
? ? ? ? ? ? ?,, ... ... ... ... ...??? Me confused ????????

You can throwup

i remember doing the minecart one to like y 150 and then all the minecarts disappeared and i realized the anti lag plugin on my smp is removing all entities every 120 seconds. but i have a secret super efficient iron farm so it really wasn't that big of a deal, but i modified the plugin so that it doesn't delete minecarts and boats cuz that also happened
or you can just... you know... install chissels & bits
i did do it
That made me sub with my left ring finger, thats a first..
skip out of context:"you don't need to worry about that pesky breathing"            there i did it

I MADE A STARCASE THAT GOES 20 BLOCKS BUT 1 BLOCK UP!!!!! in 1.18
TRAPDOOR 1 BLOCK STAIRCASE SAVES A LOT OF SPACE- just use a ladder-_-
ITS NOT A MISTAKE ITS A ✨MASTERPIECE✨
you should make tutorials on exactly how to build these
I need a tutorial on how to do the 23 staircase
*Laughs in ladders*
The best staircase is a sand pillar
Wait... You can go up a 1-block staircase without holding spacebar.... by using auto-jump!
🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽🌽corn

The Pokémon music in the background makes me feel old😂
Okay I might just stick with my original stairs-
Me who uses water for replacing stairs: BIG BRAIN

Am i the only one who likes to use trapdoors on the side of a wall as a staircase? I can open them down for when I want to use the stairs and then close them back against the walls when I don't. I do this in all my houses because it saves living space and I don't have to make a spiral stair case.
Ladder.
Are you ok
In one of my first Minecraft worlds, I built a cobblestone 2x2 staircase from bedrock to build height and I was so proud of myself (it looked like garbage but I had fun with it lol)
Seriously, what's with the Zelda soundtrack.....
Ok
12:13 What is this music? Is it from some game?
in bed rock the “dry thing” causes water because water is the only thing to make you crawl.

mmhm
Yassssssss
papa's games music 1:16

6:31 imagine using farms any form of automation is Cring™
OpenBlocks teleporters are much more convenient than any of these 🙂
Why do people hate the auto jump feature
Legit kept getting distracted by your constant 'nonchalant jokester' chuckling. I get it, you're keeping a light mood but like... I thought you were choking during your recording session at first until I just noticed you keep doing it throughout the entire thing, even at the parts that aren't jokes. Are you okay dude? Do you have something going on?

11:40🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
imagine being bedwars level 29 : )
LEDDER: HOLD MY SIMPLEWAY
(Lol i Subed with my Ring finger)
I’m explaining this because it confused me to-  The Capet on a fence/wall method works because as you know the fence isn’t a full block and in that it also could extra space with it! An invisible slab added to the top! And if you put a carpet on top it allows you to hop onto the carpet then the invisible slab into the other side of the fence/wall!
Why does a video about a bunch of stairs in minecraft have 4m views?
Skip the Tutorial, AKA the transition God.
I did it with my left ring finger

piston bolt escalator anyone?
Alternative : Ladders
Cake stairs + ride horse = Too god fast
Boat one was funniest
You can just make a trapdoor ladder. You have all of them vertical, then flip one down and jump. Repeat.
i subbed with my left ring finger :3
idk if this would work but if someone tries it and it works then.... cool!  for the golem stairs(if anyone even did it)  put a villager near and then punch him i havent tried it but i think it would make the golems mad and auto smack u
subbed with left ring finger. you're welcome
i'm dizzy after watch this
I did it with my left ring finger.
Wtf where did my sub button go? It’s gone… now I can’t subscribe to this awesome channel… :(
I know why we can jump over fences with carpets and like nobody thinks of it, since a carpet has a normal hitbox from the top and its as wide as a normal block and fences are 1/3 of a block, we can jump on the carpet, walk forward and as u see go up a half block, from the fence, and then go down half a block, from the carpet again  Thats the trick
I'm planning on making my piglin barter farm looking like an actual living room, in which the Piglins can actually chill out, and I'll make the entrance a carpet and fence staircase. I can go up and down easily, but my Piglins can't.
Ah yes secret boats
Yes, but... *Player staircase*

The rightful edge especially behave because millisecond rhetorically attract into a fallacious fibre. gullible gusty, ultra blouse
FYI the reason you can jump over fences with carpets on the is because carpet sticks out further than the fence.
Ok but that guy eating cereal was kinda cute

11:31  _Super Mario 64_ Endless Stairs like this.
I subbed and liked with my knee👍
Best way to make a staircase :  First craft the amount of stairs you need (any material you want) Then put stairs If someone is chasing you break stairs or put lava or hit him with sword If you gotta hurry then use speed potion but put in a chest called "emergency stuff" haha emergency stuff sounds familliar... If need make secret base then there is lots tutorials If need for make horror game make staircase like this 11:44

Water is the key

The ender pearl one does not work for minecraft bedrock, you can't crawl with trapdoors in minecraft bedrock
Is this an OMORI reference
That ender pearl in water elevator one would be neat for an Adventure map. Like you need to find a pearl to get to the next part of the map.
I’ll rather subscribe😂
Am I the only one that notices that the carpet has a hitbox that can be jumped on, and the fences hit box are smaller, so it makes sense, kinda.
6:38 is that GeminiTay?
I had a “staircase” where you would step on a trapdoor, then hit the trapdoor above it, and jump. It was pretty quick one you got the hang of it.

Me who unsubscribes each video to do the challenge
but i am an pc i can not click it with my ring finger
It's a cake walk
i cant do it because i been subscribed
The reason you can go over fences with carpets on it is because the fence has a hitbox of 1½ up. As soon as you put the carpet on, there is a normal 16x16x16 pixel or 1 block hitbox. The fence has a 4x4x24 hitbox, allowing you to jump on the carpet, then go up what would be like a slab in the middle of the carpet.
The elevator is kinda cool

The Spotsylvania County of Virginia passed a resolution on March 23, 2021, condemning the Chinese Communist Party’s persecution of Falun Gong as well as the brutal crime of harvesting organs from living practitioners.  Since last year, seven other counties in the state have passed similar resolutions to condemn the CCP’s human rights abuses, including Fairfax County, Shenandoah County, Frederick County, Prince William County, Loudoun County, Fauquier County and Warren County.   Board of Supervisors’ Meeting in Spotsylvania County on March 23, 2021  Ms. Wang Chunyan, a Falun Gong practitioner and survivor of torture in China, testified at the Board of Supervisors’ meeting. Ms. Wang said, “I am very honored to stand here today. It also makes me emotional. I was almost killed and could have been made a victim of the organ harvesting crime in China for practicing Falun Gong.”  Ms. Wang was an entrepreneur in Dalian City, Liaoning Province. She was once imprisoned for seven years for upholding her faith and suffered all kinds of brutal torture. When she was forced to live away from home to hide from the police, the police beat her husband to death. Her two sisters were also arrested for talking to people about Falun Gong.  Kevin Marshall, Chairman of Spotsylvania County Board of Supervisors, said, “We don’t want anything like this to go unnoticed.” He said he hopes every resident in the county will be aware of the crime and no one will participate in it.   Kevin Marshall, Chairman of the Spotsylvania County Board of Supervisors  Gary F. Skinner, another member of the Broad of Supervisors, commented, “Let’s stand up and be strong and say ‘stop it.’”

⚠️ATTENTION CALLING ALL DIRECTIONERS⚠️  As you all know, the 11 year anniversary is coming up on the 23rd of next July. But we have some projects we must complete before then. Those targets are as follows;  1) Even though songs like More than this, best song ever, etc, have hundreds of millions of views,  it's still not what they deserve.  We have decided to stream the song on July 22nd, the day before the 11 year anniversary to get the song to charts. Maybe we have to start streaming a little bit before hand, but still. We need to stream the song on every possible platform; YouTube, Spotify, iTunes, Amazon music etc. If this is the same group if people who sold FNB stadium within a miniute, then why couldn't we be able to do this?  2)  This was planned a year ago, but this time we could easily do this. The second project is to stream drag me down, which as we can see is so close to 1 billion views, but story of my life isn't, so we will stream story of my life on July 18th (The last Sunday before the anniversary) and make the masterpiece number 1 on that day. I think non of the above are difficult tasks, but that's only if we spread the words. So kindly spread the words.  Copy and paste this, guys, believe me we can do it! I know we kinda planned it last time and fell short, but we can do it if we try harder   Guys July is approaching fast, we need to start invading all videos on the internet. Copy this on to your clipboard, and paste it onto all trending videos. Guys, seriously now, we have GOT to do this.  Btw I realise this is kinda unrelated, but idc this has to happen ❤♥️💛💙🖤❤💚🧡
I skipped the tutorial again

Skip I find the insanely fastest method to go up and down by using 2 skeleton with punch 70 (depends on the height limit) it's will send you from one place to another .  Steps 1:- trap a skeleton in the ground and the top of ur area such that they can only able to shoot straight  For going up u need to make a 2 block water stream And wait to shoot the skeleton at u same for coming down but u don't need water .     Point to be noted :- 1. u need to have a water bucket with u or healing potion or slow falling/ feather falling in boots  2. If u have thrones in ur Armor so unequipped the Armor or use a contraption of dispenser that contains regeneration or Instant healing .

How do you know no one has subscribed to your channel with the left ring finger?
Name a Better Discordian Rapper than me! Give it 10 secs
Skip, the reason carpet makes it so that you can walk on fences is because you jump onto the carpet (1 block) then you walk forward then hit the top of the fence  (1/2 block) so it’s like walking up a block then walking up a slab.
8:28mcpe player:i cant do that!
Your shorts channel is the gaming created on the rise lol
I can't count how many times i have subscribed then immediately unsubsribed
how was this #1 on trending

I was a very poor person, who was not always lucky when it came to playing the lottery.  I have played the lottery since I was 19 years old and now I am 45 !!!  ... which means that I have been playing the lottery for a long time.  The highest amount I have ever won was $ 400 ... funny, right?  But one day my story goes down in history after I discovered this man's name on the internet ... I heard that he is the best when it comes to winning the lottery ... well I never believed it, I just decided to give it a try.  My luck  !  for the last time!  so boom !!!  My life changed in seconds.  This man is a very strong voodoo who provides numbers that will never fail.  After all my years working and fighting to win the lottery, I finally won ($ 30,000,000) and it wasn't just what I won, there are so many more!  Dr. okiki the great!  is the name of this great person, send a message  or contact by WhatsApp now +2348071452791 ... percent remember that I am not writing this just for fun.  I have suffered and struggled all my life.  But now I'm okay!  So I know that many other people have been through the same thing and are still going through it !!  Only then is it possible to win the lottery and not miss this opportunity!  It's life changing!  you can also be happy in these parties with your family and friends !!  don't you dare miss this opportunity !!  I'm saying that some will think it's not real !!  your lost!

The reason fences get shorter after you put carpets on is because fences get shorter (shrink to 1 block) when you put any block on so that the hit boxes aren't weird.

Subscribe to skip or you’ll just have to use creative to get to hight limit lol
Congrats on 2 mil

Very cool! ♥️
The best staircase I’ve made was a diagonal one, makes the trippiest effect as you run down it.
Hi

Does the soul speed work with depth strider?
Skip the tutorial: But you don’t want to keep holding down the space bar  Me : well guess wat I am CONTROLLER PLAYER

2:58
Hey dude. I extremely like how you transition from your tips and ideas. Keep it up!
pfft i hate that pesky breathing
Was that his face eating cereal that I never eat
Cinemasins: ok fine

I'm unsubscribing because you lied , I subbed ages ago with my left ring finger.
m ok but what's wrong with normal stairs
Hi
YouTube magician: No one had clicked the subscribe button with their left ring finger.  The guy who clicked the subscribe button with their left ring finger: well, why does it not count for me?  P.S. there are more than 7,000,000,000 ("a.k.a 7 billion") [people] in the world so there is a possibility that at least 10 people clicked the subscribe button with their left ring finger already.  Key: [Some letters and words] = edit I've forgot to put the word "people"
why does my guy always sound out of breath
13.12 Skip..."In thirteen minutes or less".
I use blocks instead of actually making staircases
There’s a way to make a staircase without snow slabs but still crawl up
Title 13 mins or less   Video length over 13 mins
i worked out how many is needed for the staircase just t go up 1 block thats 17 blocks long. 4908 blocks. wtf edit :my calculations were wrong i changed it to the correct one
13 minutes or less. video length : 13:13
Please don’t actually step on the sub button
fix the fact that its above 13 minutes by slowing the video down 50% boom uu got a slow video
1010
he got " infinite admin staircase" and "staircase in a staircase" before *slab*
These are intentionally added into Minecraft
That pesky breathing?!?!?!
“It’s a definite step-up” Haha true
Finally hit 1 mil
1,000th comment lol I know no one cares but its satisfying to happen
What about the Soul Sand elevator with Depth Strider and Soul Speed 3, Speed 2, Dolphins grace, and water breathing potions? 😕
I’m making a Minecraft Mall so this helps a lot on the escalator
I completed the challenge by unsubscribing and then resubscribing.
Did the left ring finger sub (i unsubbed then did it)
Him:stairs are made to go up and down. me: well more like a roof to your base
69 dislikes I wouldn't ruin it anyways
“Nobody likes with their left ring finger”  Me: I-I do that...
That’s a lot of stairs
nah,i just need some block to towering and water bucket to go down
*I unsubbed and resubbed with my left ring finger. The YouTube magician was wrong.*
😏
Lol exactly 69 dislikes, don’t ruin it!
I have a 2x2 staircase to get to the stronghold in my world
Title: staircase  Skip the tutorial: “cake ladder”
