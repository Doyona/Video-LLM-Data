The way he sincerely and abruptly end the interview was very intriguing to me. Did anyone else catch that?
that was gonna be a crazy fight
Wat denk je dat ik niet heb opgelet 4 lukkies
nathan is the Man but negotiating his "boys" is  really sad and weak because his "boys" are sadly waaay toooo lesss and unproved
I want him to have me sitting in a chair, take a pair of clippers, grab my head and forcefully give me a very nice, very sexy short buzz cut like his.
This dumb mothefucker is worse than Ariel
The homeboys at home are trash and probably draining your pockets. Js
About burns 😂 😂 😂 they told you those are the numbers stupid ""
There's a lot of sadness in nates eyes.
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
May 21 2025... still listening
Say what?!
16:58
Only dude that mcgregor couldnt crack mentally
Was the chump at the end edited in ???😂
Sounds like hes drunk
Most These Dudes Ain’t Even TOLD To Win. So. Supposed. It’s A Match Of Testiments. What’s The Deal??? Cuz NOBODY Know Nate Diaz. AT. ALL.
Nate is one tough son of a gun. He could absorb the hardest blows from the best strikers. Hope this guy keeps his brain intact for the future.
He got that Mike Tyson Interview energy 😂
love this guy
F U  If You can't see A Tripple  G!!!!
This reminds me of a person... asking a homeless person. If He Was A Veteran..... He Said No ..... But I'm A Veteran Of The Streets Of Oakland..... Is That Good Enough
I truly feel bad for Nate, throws blows to the head a catching up
Team DIAZ fo Life! SkaZzzZZzz! / Sweden!
Ninja rua 😂,no disrespect,i think he meant Shogun  Love watching nate win or lose,
Everything feels the same cuz he's never had a fireball 🔥
What a terrible interviewer.
"Im like Holeeeee on lemme put muh pants on" lmao
Man dis fight was gonna be legendary, idc what anyone say
If I owned a business, like Tesla, Nick Diaz would be my spokesman!  He is the best!
❤ 🙏🏼 Nate Diaz
legend. obsessed.
"I was made by my brother"  The Diaz brothers. Legends
greatest interview in MMA history
Nate was giving 100% game in this interview
“Why are you still doing it?” “It’s just what I do”
Nate at the end froze for like 2 seconds then was like THIS WAS A GREAT INTERVIEW BUT I HAVE TO GO 😂
I love Nate
The realest out there my fav athlete respect bro from Athens Greece
Nate is a real OG of  MMA the real GOAT and he knows it he knows how good he is UFC fumble it bad with nate he will always be the GOAT in my eyes and all of his fan's eye's  💯💪💪
Never would’ve pursued jujitsu if it weren’t for Nate’s season on the ultimate fighter. Forever grateful
❤🎉 GO NATE
This guys smokes some serious crack
It's so captivating to see how socially awkward and uncomfortable Nate is EXCEPT when he's talking about his own greatness. He's proud of what he's achieved in this rough sport and rightly so.
Wittness the real Mr diaz
The goat veteran bomber
There´s a true fighter right there!!! , just spotted him
im a big fan huge respect
I love nate but all I can focus on is that big zit.
He lost some fights but won the people every time by being himself♥️🗿🔥 pure entertainer , no fake stuff
Yo, I am surprised, Nate Diaz has a much higher IQ than Conor
His mental health is degrading. Bro is slurrring his words
Baked?
Is this a therapy session or an interview lmao
12:38 lol
Can people tell nate has been punched in the head to many times? I'm surprised no one said that it seems like it to me. Its definitely impacted him for sure
🐐
23:57
The goat
Nate Diaz refused to be lame..that's what I thought all through these years,and that's why I love him
I love him
7:15
"Im too real for this sport" -Nathan Diaz
UFC is nothing without Nate and Conor!.
“I hope my brother Nate Diaz whoops cocky boy.!!”
That kamaru impression is still hilarious, shout out to nate man
He fought BURNSSS dawg
Nate needs to relax and watch some Bob Ross shows, without smokin' "Happy little trees".
The man with the iron chin. There will never be a tougher fighter.
Cus you out here play fighting dawg 😂😂
Diaz never lost a fight like the whole lightweight division been knocked out slept on their faces
scarface downfall interview vibe lol
I love that Nate brought up Fedor multiple times during this interview as one of GOATS.
Diaz a Legend
The realest video on youtube. So much respect for him and his brother.
Best fighter ever to do it.....
You can tell Nate has alot bottled up. People forget the fighters are just human. They have demons like the rest of us. I wish him all the best in the future.
Why does he seem like he's high on meth or something?
Dude is on his way to a Ali future, hit in the dome to many times...
Indeed...excellent interview.  Excellent interviewer.
I frequently come back to this interview cause everything Nate said was absolute truth. He exposed the behind the scenes antics the Company pulls on their fighters. He didn't tell a single lie unlike Dana who openly bashes the fighters and bullies/hardballs them into taking fights that make no sense and take pennies for it.
Bellator
Huge fan of Nate’s fighting. Career. He’s the underdog but shouldn’t be at all. I want him to do well. That said, my man is a troubled soul. Much Love ND.
Nick and Nate are seriously legendary absolutely Nate the goat fckn super Star ✨ they really changed the fight game revaluationized it and those brothers took it to another level and seen mma for what it is a FIGHT they are a massive part of making the UFC .. period let alone just Nate bringing khamzat up . I was hoping they would fight and when he dove Nate grabbed a guillotine put him to sleep
This will always be known as Nate lowkey crying before the most important fight of his life.
Legend
real acting in the dictionary hypocrits 🔥🔥🔥👊
Dana replace this dude immediately.... there were so many instances where he thought he was asking such a deep question... Nate just looked at him and answered in a monotone voice... speaks for itself.   It is just worse because Brett genuinely believes he is asking good and solid questions... and it only gets worse if it is true that he has time to prepare these questions... definition of cringe. Come on, Brett
That dude Brett is cringey... Dana needs a man to conduct interviews with these killers... Brett is cringe man... asks questions just to ask one, to show them that he is indeed listening... dude is cringe.
Legend
This guy is one of the most handsome interviewers
Pissed on nate.. ya know what it feels like going to a car accident? Same as going to the octagon.. You get damaged, how much you not know..till it happens.
Sad to see nate suffering ptsd
Nate you tell  it like it is.
Nate did it the right way. A real fighter. Goat.
"You do steriods, I smoke weed lets get in there and fight."
That jewrnalist is too relaxed..
Khabib's Mr. GOAT cause he made a GOAT (Islam), according to Nate.
23:33 nate diaz face like wait what 🤣🤣 out of the question
It's hitting me very hard just how much Nate Diaz gave to the UFC and how much the UFC didn't give in return.  You look in Nate's eyes and you can see he knows the UFC screwed him over.
The older he gets the more he looks like nick
Long story short. :(
“You do steroids I’ll smoke weed and let’s get in there and squab” gotta love Nate Diaz bro😂😂😂💀
4:10  💯
4:34 Nate started tearing up made me have even more respect for him. I never seen Nate get emotional. My old man used to say "the only fight you'll never win against is life."
real champion people's champion 🏆 🥇 💯
Scared of a 7.5lb weight difference really? B-ass Nate would’ve been even greater had you stepped up to khamzat and actually won. Even tho we all know you’d legit die.. Nate a pu**y now. Jingliang fought Rodriguez or whatever who was 8.9lbs heavier🤦🏽‍♂️
720p nice i can almost see that its actually nate diaz
30:50 did he say "pedo"= mexican slang for drunk? Lol
28:14😂
9:50 😂 onpoint
23:56💀
This interviewer is so lame. Lame as questions.
Nate mainly got me interested in MMA. then I learned about Nick and its an all American story.
Nate looks like hes almost holding back either tears or anger but his eyes tell a story and dont underestimate this man he has been through thick and thin and still willing to entertain and prove him self on the battle field thats a true warrior he does not have to live this life, hes doing this for us and the sake of his poor old brain cells so shut up and pay attention.
I’m surprised at how no one mentions how he looks sad and fed up with it. He wants more to life than what it’s given him.
4,8,9,12yrs classic
Bro you still getting paid don't worry about it, you are a legend to us
What makes Nate so incredibly dangerous is that he is not afraid to lose.  Nobody else has that trait. He's not fighting for the UFC or the fans. He is fighting for his own level of respect.
Among the MMA I like the way you fight Mr.brave Nate 👍
the Diaz bros. are a good example to young boys and young men on how to be .Thanks guys,we need more like you two
I’ll fight all those dudes in 5 seconds no disrespect to them
How this video not hit 2 mil views already it’s irritating
Nice
I love how he needed the interview lol
Brett sucks as a interviewer
Guy behaves like a junkie
Nate diaz seems like a guy who puts on a tough front to hide the real him
This interview sucks….
"Feels like I've been goin' to war for a loong time." I applied that to things in my everyday life💯
If it happen i wish Nate wins😭😥
Nate u a beast get some
Haha everytime somebody interviews him there's so many moments of awkward silence.. haha love this guy
I respect the props he gives his brother, so loyal, lovely to see
It’s a good thing God gave Nate Diaz hands because he sure didn’t give them any brains….at all.  Either he’s completely stoned or his brain has deteriorated significantly…I mean look at him in this interview.
I heard of Nate D. But I never watched him. I never listened to him. So, I started watching him. I started listening to him. His come off is ghetto- but I don’t think his mindset is ghetto. This guy is both smart and complex. It would appear as though he does not subscribe to the same set of priorities that basically everybody else in the UFC including Dana White have. He appears to bring it to the fight though. He appears to have honest dedication to himself and his followers.
Nate is all over the place.
Interviews are better without the Mermaid Ariel doing it.
I have a feeling he'll show more advanced signs of CTE after this fight
Nate looks and talk only half their. He ok or punchdrunk?
Let’s goooooo
Nate  (16-11)  Nick (8-7-1)  In the UFC. LEGENDS
I like Nate diaz but that dude has the attention span of a 4 year old.
Hey Diazs, get off marijuana. It’s not doing you any good…
Why did Nate speak with a southern accent tho lol
It is just me or does he sounds like mike tyson?
Nate yes you are
Haaa U welcome
I agree with nate!!! He's never not suprised me at any moment in his career. Fr, dude does deserve respect. Just his career proves it. He's been undercarded constantly. He can prove his worth in the ring, whether we like it or not. This is someone who doubted him in every big fight, but he showed up my expectations. Total respect from me, cause he does speak his mind as well. I used to not like him, but he is still who he is and is and not afraid of what comes too him. For his longevity it's great too see, just speaking honestly
I love the way Nate Diaz thinks
Your fights are all fire. With you everyone knows they get there monies worth. You should be paid according to what you bring in
Khamzat would absolutely murder Diaz. Take a 30 second "break" and then murder his brother for fun.
Nate is done , he's last fight  sucked
One of the most humble dudes I’ve ever seen
Win lose or draw as long as you get down .. that’s gangsta
It's what I do👑💯🐐
Any Brett Okamoto interview is so awkward and cringey
love...love...love nate!!!   he is the most exciting fighter....you just never know what he will do!!!
12:45 Nate not looking forward to the fight with Khamzat..
Shitzat scared
720p? These guys deserve a slap from Nate for the disrespect 😂
“You should’ve worked on a computer or something, ya nerd.”  — Nathan Diaz
Much Respect but I Think He's Taken a few Too Many Punches.... I Hope He Doesn't Get Permanently Hurt
Diaz brothers were the ufc, Dana white just a typical insidious xtion narcissist
“If you’re effin Mr. GOAT then make a GOAT”
Him and his brother they are great fighters but they need to relax a lot. Good luck 🤞
nice
Nate is telling it straight! You’ll always be the BEST Nate, everyone knows it! Shame on the UFC for being nothing but parallel to the scripted WWE!
I feel sorry for him because mentally retardation is a disability,I deal with special needs adults 24 hours a day I can tell you he deserves better in life. God bless him 🙏 The UFC low-balled him on pay because of this reason.
i greated you... my brain alright... the stank... i cant deal with... and the weak heart...
Nick and Nate real mfs
Bret Akimodo kinda messed the interview by getting his facts wrong about the Cowboy Cerrone fight. Thats what makes Ariel a great reporter he knows all the UFC PPV's by heart.
29:32😂😂😂
30:08😂😂😂
You're the best my friend keep pushing this fight about it you the best  my friend 🙏 ❤️  Get it  die for this
I love how the interviewer didn’t interrupt Nate and let him just speak 👍 great interview
Too bad Chimaev was too chicken.
Nates fan base shows that it doesn't matter if you win or lose, its about the effort and being real.
Nate and Nick are the best ever in my opinion. I have always watched ever fight they were in
When he said he's the most active fighter,I had to turn it...
I would have loved to watch any of the fights Nate mentioned.
Here after the fight he’s now a free man leaving a winning man but regardless a legendary soldier of the Nick Diaz Army!
Heart of the ufc.
Even when Nate is sitting in a chair his shoulders are up
👂
First time I have seen this interviewer, you could not of picked a better guy to interview Nate Diaz, one of the hardest guys to interview on this plant. Well done sir.
Man him and nick look more alike with each passing year
Nate is One of the Goats of UFC  no doubt about it❤️
Brett Oklahoma is a good interviewer
Nate is the champion of the UFC. Who else has taken ANY fight at ANY time and been as successful as him? Also, the "keep it real" part of him makes him the people's champ anyways.  Nate is the baddest.
The dude is the goat
And then Nate let Bret go like a Boss.
Jones is DQ 23:36
Is there anyway I can watch this uncensored?
Hamzats future 10:27
*Nate Diaz beats Hamzat on the Scale, Strangles Tony, Rides off into Sunset*                              *(🤑😎💚💚💨💨💨)*
“If you’re mr.goat, then make a goat” godamn thats some fire
NATE IS THE TIM ARMSTRONG OF FIGHTING
So funny how he says burns when talking about khamzat
Real gangsters were the Italians who had style and character back in the day!…The other minorities who want to fill those shoes are nothing but a bunch of hoodlum wangsters that society has written off!..Nate Diaz needs to control his hate and racism towards fighters from the muslim world who are dominating in mma and should thank god that he didn’t fight khamzat other there wise he would of got mauled to the path of no return.✌🏻
Usman knocked out masvidal. Masvidal beat up nate diaz. Father time beats everone. Sucks about the politics. But at least you beat up Dana's boy Connor mcgregor just like Khabib did.  👍🏻
Agree to him about Jones and Silva. Both drug cheats.
Nate should be in everybody’s top 5
I took you when you was supposed to fight dude and I took you when they changed it to tony
Nate I love you brother but you need a break. The brain can’t take much more damage. You’re a freaking machine but it’s time. Nothing but respect. A real G
“Nobody’s fought the top 10 fighters for last 15 years, nobody, nobody. Nobody!” 🐐
This guy is grass roots badass MMA....He's a legend that no one can ever forget if they really follow MMA. He'll fight anyone and always represent. It will be sad when he retires.
lucky ....khamzat would have mauled him
Nate took too many shots to the head in his career. Hope he don't end up like Ali or Spinks when he gets older. Has a hard time finishing a sentence.
NICK: "If youre a G.O.A.T, make a G.O.A.T - prove it" <<< Thats GOAT speech
He is on something
Who is this clown doing the interview.   Granted Nate isn’t an easy interview but please
backing nate in whatever he wants ,thanks for shutting mcmunckin up n choke him out  i love holly for doin it to ronday  you for conor n Caine for brock
when it comes to the realest fighters no one is = to Nate 100% legend
He got hit in the head one too many times
He was innocent and humble before they desensitize the comment section. Do people not realize how stupid this guy is. A literal vegetable. He needed to be humbled by Kaz Matt now he’s just gonna be annoying.

Nothing but respect Nate your a warrior 👊🏼
Diaz army. I need to be there for when Nathaniel says Dana White. ( was too high}
Great interview from Brett.  Nate seemed comfortable, so we got some good content from him, including anecdotes & stories from the arc of his entire UFC career up to this fight.
Thank you for everything Diaz 💪🏾
The Diaz Brothers r well respected in chi raq specially from the Latin 🤴
Thank God he didn't have to fight khamzat... Would hate to see him absolutely destroyed
The UFC needs a competitor
Nate is a beast you know he practiced that crem de la crem all week so he could refer to himself as such in the ring after the win! AND HE PULLED IT OF FLAWLESSLY!
this man has some really serious underlying depressions .. i can tell the way people talk and act i was depressed for 6 years myself ..
Too legit to quit! Nick and Nate are icons. Ambassadors for the sport. I'm my own champion! Nate is on point with they are using him to make other people's careers. Truth.
“I refuse to be lame” legendary words from Nate, you’re the man.
he kinda sounds like mike Tyson
Best interview ever....Nate is the GOAT, and he explains exactly why 👍👍
14:51 "Why are you even talking to me" *with hand gesture* 🤣
"... if you're Mr. GOAT, then make a GOAT"
I love the Diaz brothers. I truly do believe that Nate legitimately passed Nick up when it comes to superstardom though if it wasn't for Nick the elder of the two we wouldn't have had Nate.  And Nate isn't known as Nick's younger bday brother.
Man Oh Man I'm seriously truly going to miss Mr. Nate the Great Diaz!!!!!!!!!!!
“Contract for all my guys…”  What a mindset…!! Bravo Nate!
“…..because they got a deal with fight island” yes that’s why khabib, Islam and khamzat are hyped
I totally agree Dana said Khamzat is beast and coming legend and MMA media and fans followed this narrative without hesitation. Khamzat could have easily lost to burns and compared to Diaz brothers doesn’t even close having the years and adversity of nick and Nate
Diaz is happy not to Fight Khamzat, if he can't die Diaz. Hi uncle Diaz you bullsit man.
Nate is a real G.
Facts!
Nate can lose, he can win, it doesn’t matter. That man deserves all the flowers
This guy is so stoned this interview
Unfortunately both Diaz brothers are bleeders and cut easily, and as a result look like they are losing fights that they are actually winning. Eg. Nick v karo, kj noons, nate v mcgregor 2
Nate Diaz!! You are the man, your attitude and personality! Your love for fighting, its what you do!!!😆
He sounds worried lol
Where the facts yes ..... he's proven came back and still most wanted fighter 💯
If you want a  good fight , if you want excitement , if you want views , if you want   respect from a good fighter we want to see Nate Diaz 💪💪💪💪💯💯💯💯
Can't lie he's the only one I know would give us a good fight and the only one we stick with and would pay good money to see fight so they need to give him a contract a good contract because as long as he's fighting every one would pay more...  I know I would .... get it together UFC he's global and most wanted then now until he says he's done 💪💯❤️  Nate Diaz 🐐🐐💪💪💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Hes like the tarded version of michael keaton in multiplicity. "I like pizza"
Ahhh CTE
You can’t help but admire his ferocity hope he comes up with the dub on this one
I really want Nate to win 🖕🖕
you callin a spade a spade mate. dinkum
Respect to this man absolute soldier him and his brother 💯
Diaz is a true warrior khamzat missing weight shows fear on khamzat and his camp.I say Dana couldn't take the chance .
Brett interview w Diaz 2 million views 4 days up..Brett w khamzat 800k 5 days upI. Khamzat backstage 35 dudes w him and Diaz 70 dudes…then Khamzat decides he doesn’t want to make weight lmao
Hey Nate.. take a step back after  this n get away  bro...
Nate is a legend mad respect for this man. The peoples champ
Such a real one.
Nothing but respect for Nate 💪👍
This really was a great interview, he asked all of the right questions without antagonizing him. I'm glad Nate let down his guard a little.
OVER 1M SUBSCRIBERS AND CAN'T AFFORD A 4K OF VIDEO? 720? 2008 quality in 2022? Yall about 15 years behind.... When you guys gonna upgrade your toaster to get professional video quality?
This was a great interview Nate usually doesn’t talk this much and open up and to here his way of thinking about it all was very interesting!! Shouting out his brother and what he said was true they are real fighters but weren’t the poster boys the UFC wanted to blast all over posters etc…but the Diaz brothers have more respect from the fans then any of those other fighters!!
can someone plz tell diaz to start a podcast so he can start getting this podcast money and protect his brain . cuz we need ppl like him on podcast hahaha
Warrior one of the goats much love nate
Nate’s the peoples champ…He has been doing this so long we will always have his back for all of his endeavors from here on out as well!!!
Nate has always been too real for the entertainment industry. As corny as that sounds, it's the truth. He doesn't care about mass media, or the UFC's scripted drama series. All he wants to do is fight. The Diaz brothers always did all of their marketing in the octagon. If you want to know why you should watch the next Nate Diaz fight, he shows you in the octagon. He doesn't sell you a bag of goods with lip service. Nate is the real deal, and because there's not many other guys like him in the UFC, it's hard for the UFC to adapt to Nate, because their system works well for the other 99% of the fighters. People who think Khabib is the goat are out of their minds. Khabib's a prima donna who's only concern was being undefeated. Khabib dodged fights by missing weight, or being injured. Every fighter is injured every time they step into the octagon. Fighters hide injuries every fight to clear medical. The only reason someone would know about your injury, assuming it's not life threatening, is if you tell them. There's only one reason you announce an injury to the doctors....FFS Bisping hid the fact that he only had one eye. Nate's never been popped for PED's , and the only thing he's ever dodged was a press conference.
I just want to hug him. Nate is the man! Who cares what any body says. We know you are the greatest fighter!! You just don't and won't play the corrupt political BS Dana White does and that comes with this. Just like you said Nate F them ALL!! Every one loves you!
16:00 - Deep
That is precisely how a real fighter looks and talks like
the most authentic fighter in the UFC
Even though nate has a speech problem  I get alot of what he's saying
Love it 😎😎😎👍👍👍🤙🏻🤙🏻🤙🏻
And another thing, I don't buy the reasons Dana gave for kumshot not making weight! Kumshot was disrespectful and unprofessional but Dana sees money with him so he's going to have his back. Dana should have had Nate and Nick's back all along but he didn't like them because they stood up to him! For me it's Nate 1, kumshot 0 ! I'm happy for Nate because now he has the fight he wanted!
He made it... 33 minutes in an interview he probably never wanted to make...
this guy conducting this interview SUCKS!
Nate Diaz is one of the realest fighters to ever fight MMA. No questions asked. Dude is a warrior.
whos here after chasmat failed to make weight 😆
Nate is the mike Tyson of the ufc 👍👍👍😎😎😎😎💪💪💪💪
NICK WON !!!
I loved what Nate was saying about everyone else has been playing “champion” while he was thinking about the fight game from a different perspective. He’s essentially saying he’s now trying to play the “champion” game and wants a W on Saturday to make a good case for the next title fight. Even though he “claims” he wants to quit the UFC, I think his heart might be somewhere else.
The way Nate pronounces Ngannou reminds me of home
One of the old school best,  I’m Not Surprised Motherfuckers
GUY IS BRAINDEAD....would be wqshing dishes or scruibbing toilets  or be in jail or dead if not for the ufc.
Dude what are you talking about Leon Edwards whooped you pillar to post the delusion is insane didnt he call out Khazamat
pu'zzi he was so scared of Khamzat that he has beeen creamfeeding him.. sure the jury is still out how Nate Diaz did it and if he has been cahoot with UFC doctor that was handling Khamzat.. but no doubt about it, Nate Diaz has been creamfeeding Khamzat, so he missed the weight with 7½ pounds... that is unheard.. // newermind, it wasn't Nate Diaz... its trending now. Khamzat got a breastmilk fetich and has been a frequent customer at the local "big ladies br0thel"  in his stay in the US... there are some picture circulating with Khamzat in a diaper and all... sadly not allowed to link..
i fought all top ten fighters smfh well nate these champions fight top 1 fighters fight after fight this dude is so tormented he never won a belt
You know why Nate doesn’t have the big cauliflower ears ? Because he doesn’t turn his face from danger !
Stoned?
Nate is the best interview ever! This is why Daiz is your favorite fighters favorite fighter
Bro is so dumb😂
is it me or does he seem highly medicated ?
The interviewer looked like he had the sickest mullet when the video first started.
love Nates mind set... F@ck everybody.... Wish him the best post UFC!!!!
Yo @espn don't mute Nate Diaz
It’s literally painful to listen to Nate talk
Love you nate
What's with the quality ? 720p? This is 2022
Nate Diaz is a pure STUD!!!
DIAZ BROTHERS, NEVER CHALLENGED KHABIB,
I respect Nate to the fullest. I'm sure he's going to win.
Why does he sound like Mike Tyson?
Shouldn’t they get someone who can smoke a couple joints that’s capable of interviewing Nate?
Diaz is punch drunk
Nate looks the dude from delocated without the ski mask
“You’re still being their champion.” Wise words. I will always buy Nate’s fights. I couldn’t even care about the rest.
Love this guy. Always have; both brother's. But I can't understand what he is talking about 75% of the time.
Nate should get his time holding the title as champion
Megan Olivi should've done this interview. She sounds much better than this interviewer.
Stop judging its not drugs, fighting affects your mental health so much,  its not easy to do this job, Good luck Nate.
I can't watch a Nate Diaz interview. He sounds like he's 3 brain cells away from being medically brain dead.  Kids, don't do drugs, and take punches you don't need to take.
Nate, much, much love son. If I could pick someone to swing with, it would be you son. Anyone else, I can't imagine an actual fight. Your ten years younger than me, but man, I am little scared of Nick.  Now everyone, don't read this wrong, even I won't put a dollar on me. What I'm getting at is one good, clean lick and Mr Diaz takes his opponents seriously. That is something to respect far about fight stats, far more than a title or a belt.
His voice sounds like Mike Tyson’s
Man it seems like Nate gets lost in thoughts a lot and I have to wonder if it’s from the weed or the years of battle
“I’m nobody’s champion…. I’m my own champion”
If it's a war than realize a leader or a general is needed and at the END it's about the money. Respect is earned and lost with zero physical damages but mess with the flow of the dollar now that's business that effects the physical future wich requires immediate response or else it's on you.Nate vs Tony hmmm if Nate doesn't bleed to much he will win this competition.
we love you nate
He’s half retared but I love the dude
NATE .... DIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZ
@32:27 Nate definitely droppin the n-bomb "what n**** that's how you do this, what's up!?"
Put some respect on Nate’s name
For some reason I had this feeling that Diaz was going to shock the world again and beat khamzat
I understand what he's saying. Everything feels the same, from wen I was 16 til now 25 years later. 1 blurry day is wat it feels like.
Let's Go Nate
Both Brothers Blueprints of UFC Fighters
LEGEND! 😎💯
If You're Fkn  Mr.Goat Then Make A Goat 🐐 Bahhhh
Absolute legend.
Maaaaad Respect To NICK DIAZ
UFC has become such a circus
Volume
Nate lowkey sounds like a drunk uncle 😭
Respect to nate man  that was a lot of built up tension he had to get out
Scripted is the word Nate dog ruff!
His philosophy and dedication to fighting and being a true warrior really puts him in an entirely different class of fighter. Mad respect Nate. I hadn’t really heard him out until this interview and after explaining his philosophy + the gangster exit….fan for life! I hope the UFC pays this man the respect he’s earned and deserves.
I've never had more respect for any fighter this guys is the truth a true king much love to you nate keep that mind state your one of a kind ....
What y’all think about what he said about Jon jones . I kinda agree wit Nate
This might have been the greatest interview in MMA history.
13:55 - Nate has an incredible point here.
💯
Win lose or draw, don't matter. I will always be a Diaz brothers fan over everyone else. WARDIAZ.
The older I get the less patients I have for adults who can't speak!
Now Nate gets the fight he deserves. Nate vs Tony is 🔥🔥
Nate Diaz is a real one, he doesn't change, keeps it 100. He should be on Jon Bernthal's REAL ONES. Would love to see them two kick it.
I'd have him in my corner any day win or lose.
FEEL SO SORRY FOR NATE !! HE CANT REALLY SPEAK NO MORE SO WHAT WOULD IT BE IN THE COMING YEARS!! JUST MUMBLING LIKE JAMES TONEY!!!  VERY SAD DOE!!
You can see this man knows what he's fighting for......against the org......against the haters......he knows what's at stake. He's gonna go hard. Watch
What he's saying is war is very passionate for him , it's everything.
Fk You For One, Fk You All Together, Where's The Facts Psshhh ... You Fought Burns Dog... You Fought Burns... Know What I'm Sayiin .. Whatever 😂
Legend
Nate is a smart guy. He sees through all the BS and calls it out. That’s a real ☝️
"Who do you feel like you're going to war against?" Nate-"the organization" That says it all.
23:55 nate with slipping in the smoothest N-bomb ever lol
CTE
weed + CTE and you get Nate
Is it just me or is nate giving off serious mike tyson vibes throughout this interview
Nate’s the peoples champ
I been a fan of nate cause hes action packed but some times hes dilusional n thinks too hard ufc is bout money not feelings
Nate should Stockton Slap the interview guy Brett Okomoto just for asking questions 😂😂😂 Man the UFC aint gong to be the same without The Diaz Brothers, Nate brings excitement and unpredictability to the sport, the card change is a welcome one ☝️  Let’s watch these two warriors get to scrapping!!!🇲🇽🇺🇸🇲🇽🇺🇸🇲🇽✊✊✊
THE LAST DANCE !
“If you’re the goat, make a goat.” Real G-nius
NATE SHOULD HAVE SAID I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO WAR WITH OUR GOVERNMENT JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD!!!!
SHOULDA BEEN AN OG THEN AND TOOK THE FIGHT.  SCARED.  BACK IN THE PRIDE DAYS GUYS GAVE AWAY 25LBS ALL DAY LONG AND STILL FAUGHT.  THIS DUDE AINT NO G.
The guy interviewing is a douchebag. I would have walked out.
Finally somebody gives respect to BJ Penn they act like he didn't do anything
Soft-@$$ cream puffs shouldn't be interviewing fighters. F**k this b**ch.
This interviewer is lucky to not get slapped up in the first two minutes. No respect. Punk-@$$ b*tch.
Great interview for sure but next time Brett, stand up when you shake someone's hand. It is a sign of respect.
But no they be paying some out towners when you got best guys by you all along bj Nick Diaz Nate Diaz
Feeling like Nate Diaz should have been most paid fighter
“You should’ve worked on a computer somewhere you nerd.” - Nate Diaz 😂😂😂
He just sounded like a bitter loser on his way out...
Respect
Diaz brothers are the realest dudes in UFC
This guy just talks utter nonsense and all his npc fans eat it up
Nate totally understood the dynamic "It's not even about this guy...it's about making this guy"
GEMATRIA
Nate Diaz lettttssssss gggggooooooo! I ain’t suprized motherfucker we love u in these streets boi give that chechin a big slap on that beard big bro
Thug love@ Nate Diaz 209 Stockton to 414 midtown …baybayyyyyyyy
Nate is far more intelligent then he gets credit for
There is more wisdom & advice on the fight game in this interview than the entirety of Chael Sonnen’s youtube channel. Absolutely phenomenal.
Nate will always be top dog 🐕 100% respect 🖖
This dude legit.  The realest.  War Diaz.
33 minutes later what did he say ??? but still one of the greats ....
Brett asks 2 questions in the half hour 🤣😂 Nate’s and nick are 1 in the same .. a question leads to a 15 minute rant lol
Only Nate finishes his own interviews. GOAT
literally fights for himself, his friends and his fans...doesnt care about anyone else!
Poor Nate. When the brain gets years of trauma, speech impediment is showing. Difficulty articulating and speaking.
Smoke in the brain
I wish my brother and I had a relationship like Nate and Nick.
This sport takes its toll. We thank and respect those who risk it all to demonstrate what we might become.
Nate Diaz we all know you are the UFC You were 100% right when you said that!!
brain damage is a thing
If you’re here after the changes on the card Hit Like 😂
Diaz Army forever ! 209 ! Stockton muthafuckers ! It won’t be the same without Nate.
Nice guy. sounds a little like cte old man but he's only young.
Nate is the absolute champion. 💯
🔴 8:48 "You guys are champions cuz yall had this weird little goal...."  😆 🤣 laughing to the bank. Nate speaks Fax! 🙌
Top one percent of the toughest men on the planet
Nate, is one brilliant fighter... He speaks the truth and is truly exposing the Ufc and Dana for what they are... One of the Ufc's supposed under rated fighter there is...
Nate’s actually spittin facts halfway into the interview
Well loved
gotta love nate! idk how you could hate on him ever
86 86u86u 864u
45 u4u47
r uu u 54 54
4 5y5y554y
Nate and Mike Tyson are so similar
The only thing he’s done is beat Connor and that’s not hard to do
Not everybody's saying it Nate!  In my opinion, you, your brother and maybe two other guys ARE the ufc!  I'd bet on you any day, every day!!  Gracie jui jitsu is the best in the world and the Diaz brothers are the toughest mf'ers in the fight game!
Nate the f*ckin Great
All change  😜👍🏼
There’ll NEVER be another Nate Diaz, so just appreciate him while he’s here and he’s able to do what he loves… Fighting! 💯💯💯
Throwing Gang Signs mid interview 😂
As bizarre as it is....this whole weight mix up could not have happend on a better card.....swapping the final 3 fights around actually worked out perfectly
How can you not click on this video after seeing the thumbnail
Nate Diaz is a G
“If your mr. goat, then make a goat”  -Nate Diaz (Nick Diaz Army)  September 2022
Nate & Nick Diaz is Robert DeNiro & Al Pacino Of MMA
G.O.A.T
Nate already won. Beat the entire company before even walking out to fight. Love it.
tf is up with this video quality
This guy has mental problems…you can tell…his biggest fight is internally
This interviewer is rubbish. Trying to put words in Nate's mouth, contradicting him, obsequious manner...
DIAZ...Fam....For Life......
Best fights av seen Nate v Connor let's go Nate Scottish back you
Sometime, Nate reminds me of Robert DeNiro in this interview!
nate is a savage and knows whats up.  talk about honesty.  What a man
I like watching Nate fight, but Jesus…what an incredibly incoherent rant.
If Nate had the vocabulary of Shakespeare it would be clear how intelligent he is, knows the game, reads people, funny, talented with incredible warrior spirit.
Is funny the I gotta go section kinda highlights what he was saying the whole interview about conducting his affairs. Own boss
Nate knows that he OWNS the man.
Best interview of nate
Yeas! He mentioned Fedor
dont get wrong guys... the cries is effect from the Dope@Marijuana 🤔😅😁😁
I respect Tony Ferguson and Diaz, but I’m hoping Diaz brings it home for his last fight in contract, he’s been an absolute psychopath inside the cage over the years, one of the toughest units the UFC has ever seen and a heart of steel.
UFC 141 was 11 years ago. Wow, time sure does fly in this sport.
Great interview 👍🏻👍🏻❤️209👋
I love Nate but his brain is scrambled.. this was an incoherent ramble
TOUGH AS NAILS
Very interesting interview I hope all watch this.
He asks him so many times "do you FEEL"...."how does it FEEL"...and Nate opens up and starts rolling. Nate makes a lot of sense too. And then - the brothers' love part - mixed together on me imagining how he feels now, when he knows that he might be a punching bag, and has the cojones to do it regardless. This is Sparta.
Love watching Nate ! When he fights you know "There will be Blood"!
Not gonna lie I thought nate diaz was in a therapy session.. ready for the new card though!!
Francis Nigannou is CRAZY tho 🤣
Was this interview in English?
Yo bro it's not even Nate vs anyone important at all in all this at all. The mind set of this war is preparing for the fight against himself always has been. Can't expose all those secrets of a Champion character like Nate, but I know he's training to win against himself always. They always kept him hungry and that's how they keep someone wanting in the fight business but I hope he wins that fight we don't get to see against himself because that version of Nate he's training for got the belts in all the different weight classes in the dark 🌑. Once he's done with that and he owns himself and choose what the fight is gonna be like we are gonna still see this crazy dude test the guts out of everyone stepping up to him.    Diaz vs Ferguson is gonna be what we all wanted to see but couldn't. It makes so much more sense to me that if we wanna see a fight with real scrappers we're gonna have this one for sure since both these dudes got warzone headsets. Kill or Be Killed! Blastin Smoke!
He’s in his own little world😂
It’s very sad that the UFC had both nick and Nate all these years and had they pushed them as their main stars they would have pushed the sport even further than they already have. Nate is right man, we don’t need buttoned up goody two shoe champs and Conor proved that. Nate and Nick being champions would have truly pushed the sport to another echelon
Win or lose ,you are Stocktons champ
Nate is going to beat Kumshot
A real G who can leave with his head held high.
Stockton loves you brother, do you
“This was a great interview Brett I have to go” lmfao 😂 the only proper way to end a Nate Diaz interview
You can tell Nate and Brett have a solid relationship and Brett knows how to conduct an Nate Diaz interview and just let the man speak his mind. Love how it ended on Nate saying “I almost beat up Dana at a club” lmao
Still the ONLY mf that ends his own interviews! 🤣🤣 got to love it
CTE speaking
Great lisper
Nate the best......done.
Nate seems to suffer from tramatic brain injury.
Nate Diaz interviews give me Mike Tyson vibes...
Cumtwat Chimaev didn't make weight because he knew Nate was going to win and it would slow his career and possibly end it.
Nate really ask the UFC 10 contracts for his homie a real one
Americans put subtitles on South Africans and Jamacans, we need to have subtitles for this dribbler.
How many are here after Khamzat didn’t make weight??
"This was a great interview Brett, I have to go." Only nate diaz does that.
He looks very relaxed, great interview.
we need another interview now that the card changed.
we make plans & God laughs while changing our plans.
horrendous
4 minutes iin i gave up . nates slower than a sloth. good lord get this guy off the camera id rather listen to bruce buffer
Bro no joke I know he’s never been the best speaker but I think he don took too many blows all love and he warrior probably want to die fighting
Fedor Emelianenko 👍
hilarious. boy cant properly answer 1 question
Someone send the uncensored version of this interview
He has so much trouble getting his thoughts into words. You can see the frustration in his face trying to say what he is thinking. I really hope this is it for him. He's taken enough damage in his career. He doesn't owe anyone anything anymore. Good luck Nate..
He's fighting ferguson??
I hope that fighters get the well deserved mental help they need. Nate isn't wrong when he says they just throw the top guys to get his name out there... That's pathetic that they use him just for his name and they don't care if he can take them or not.
Been following the Diaz bros long before a lot of you bandwagon fans arrived, but for anyone who has watched this guy he doesn't have the heart for this anymore. You can see it in his speech and just how he generally carries himself. Once he got paid from the Conor fights he just lost that hunger. However, he will still go out there and bang!
Uncle Nate vs Uncle Toni UFC 279 Main Event. What a Shame Main Event of UFC Turned into a FLOP Event, Old Uncle's fighting for nothing. Its Trash Fight.🤣😂
I love Diaz. He always puts his team first
I like how the dude just let nate rant
General Nate free moral triple agent strategist extradinare, brings it like a Book of 5 rings art of war samurai. Timing and spirit strategies forstalling for time enough to facilitate collapse in an instant or two. Native Nate moving naturally striking naturally knowing the rhythm of every situation prevails.
33:03 He literally looks like Nick in that shot
9:51 kumaru impersonation haha
I love how Nate ends his interviews. 😂
You’re my boy Nate, you’re my boy!
Crazy how the first one he said when listing guys he wanted to fight was tony, really glad he could get a fight he actually wants. those guys are gonna go to war tonight!
It’s a business and Nate has always been on the outside of it. Look at Daniel Cormier he’s the typical yes man and now he’s got a lifetime gig with the company. Nate is loved by the people but hated by management. Nate has given so much to the UFC and they’re just like don’t let the door knob hit ya on the way out. At least the fans are getting Nate vs Tony for one last “Wild Card Fighters” bout. Nate and Tony are both legends and complete maniacs, this fight is way better!
“Fear the man who has nothing left to lose” - sun tzu probably
Nate has a point. This is why I stopped watching ufc.
That was fantastic.  You feel for Nate man.  That interview hurt me.   Diaz
Watching this after cards changed and hes now headlining tony and watching this as if hes talking about ferguson and not khamzat is mf hilarious  😂
“I never asked for nothing I demanded and took what I’m gonna take “  🔥
Such a poignant interviewer lol...bummed about this cancellation...but Ferguson vs Diaz is interesting
Gotta love Nate never folds always gives it his all at least when you book him you know your gonna get a good old fashioned brawl none of this point fighting bs! Dont get me wrong their is nothing wrong w fighting smart its how you become champ sometimes but as far as entertainment Nate is that
12:50  So you are afraid
And he said he wants to go onto higher things? How high can he get? Jfc.
What is ufc did 2 on 2’s
Anyone who has ever had a friend.  A real friend that will stand by you and fight with you, and not leave you, appreciates a man like Nate Diaz.  Authentic and true.
Nate Diaz number One!
It’s either buddies on opioids or he’s super punch drunk I could barely understand bro
No hespect for Oliveira?
Nate already won by Chimaev missing weight
Diaz 💯💯💯💯💯💯
Poor guy. I’m sure he would be just as brain-addled without ever being punched but…add a few thousand shots to the head and the smoke…he’s next level.
One of the greatest minds Of all time a true warrior
"Al Pacino, Adam Sandler" 🤣🤣
Task just like Tyson.
I can't stand this interview where he's acting like a f****** therapist he's a piece of s*** and that was the wrong person to be talking to Nate Dogg
Nate Diaz is the Mike Tyson of the UFC. If not, Nate Diaz is the Nate Diaz of the UFC and that’s about as comparable as it gets.
At some point, I don’t think I heard the interviewer for the rest of the interview 😂
The UFC would be so dumb to let this guy go 🐐
They need to make them lay on a therapy couch. Lol
I hope he retires and enjoy his fruits of labor
Wrong person to do the interview I 100% understand what Nate d is the same the interviewer obviously doesn't.
sneak steroiding
Diaz brothers are the real champions of ufc.
You can tell Nate Diaz despises UFC for trying to use him as a stepping stone & demands respect. Much respect to Nate for sure, he’s been ranked top 10 for a long time.
Anybody else concerned that he has severe brain damage
What a absolute legend 💪
“If your Mr. Goat then make a goat 🐐 “
Nate looks like that puppet Jeffrey Dunham has
Nate talks like he has brain damage
Wow! Someone offered this Clown another fight?! NERDS/DORKS OF THE UFC BOY BAND OF THE UFC! TWEAKERS
Bro I’m glad this fight didn’t happen Nate did not want it but a real gangster at the end of the day and took it khamzat is something no one wants a part of that’s to be expected he will be champion when he does finally get a title shot
Always
Nates a legend
Great interview but tough to watch. CTE for days.
But why is it censored
Diaz vs Ferguson, cant wait! Speaking of "high" moments.... or mb that's just me haha
Kockmop missed weight 😂
Was this filmed on a potato or is it just me
Brain damage
Nate Diaz, ladies and gentlemen.
He seems to have a mental disability
“This fights not even about this guy, it’s about making this guy” Nate really sees everything for what it really is. A real G.
Felt like I was watching a therapy session
free bread 💰 😭
What a cry baby!  Nate is just like his brother Nick.  All they do is complain.  Best part of this fight will be when Nate leaves the arena and we never have to hear or see this idiot again.
I always loved watching the Diaz brothers fight, but their neglect with wrestling separated them from being not just champions, but dominate champions. Im not buying the whole I didn’t care about being a champion.
"creme de la creme....Is that how you say it" every line is a quoteable with this guy
Robert DeNiro of MMA, but better, bigger and a f'n legend.
“If those guys are the GOATS, then I’m the fkn Lion” - Diaz mentality
Does Nate have a chance on the ground? No disrespect. I just don’t remember. Nate deserves this fight it’s taken long enough. I just hope he stays healthy and doesn’t get hurt. I’m really glad this will be his last it’s been a great run and he’ll forever be a ufc legend . It’s tough seeing all the fighters I have watched from the beginning getting older and having their last fights. I don’t care who wins I just want Nate to be healthy when it’s over.
Nate é foda pa caralho!
People think he’s punch drunk or CTE, but he’s a lot smarter than what people think. Because I get what he’s saying clearly he just has a tough time communicating because of where he’s from. I was born and raised in the Central Valley like Nate. And it has some of the toughest people I know who are sometimes literally just trying to survive. So when he says he doesn’t care about the belt, because he literally doesn’t. He’s saying he’s proving to HIMSELF that he’s the toughest sob in the room and doesn’t need an arbitrary leather belt to prove that you’re worthy something. He doesn’t need anyones approval to prove that he’s a champion. He looks up to his mentors and heroes the Gracie’s because he literally probably saw them as real life superheroes to get him out of the hood.
Nate Diaz is the real deal. Not like the great white hopes pushed to the front of the line.
The only title Nate Diaz has ever won is the most delusional fighter in mma history.  Khabib was not only the best lightweight in history but knew how to carry himself.  The jealously he shows toward greats like Khabib and Usman is pathetic.
this looked like more of a therapy sesh. im glad nate got that off his chest
Thank you Nate, smiled so much my head hurts
I’m a Nate Dias supporter awesome guy man 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
I’m not gonna fight him in there ever, but I’ll fight him anywhere right now LOL.
Love Nate. He's definitely stoned.
GSP is the 🐐. Sooo..... if Nate says Nick is the best.......... 😬
Table head hazmat I can set a 40 and wingbox on his head for lunch.  Wide head but really strong so nate can't beat him.
Great interview
@4:10 me too
TF is he saying😑
209 🔥
Nate bro. Respect😎✊👊
I cheesed the whole time watching this classic real g love it
Brain damage looks like it to me
I'm really gonna miss this guy.
"You do steroids I smoke weed let's get in there and squad." - Nate Diaz
Seems like ppl that have a hard time talking and comunincating like nate clearly does(no disrespect intended) they tend to make great fighters
diaz bros  both hall of famers
I'm not surprised MFS! - Nate Diaz
Khamzat better bow to Nate and thank him for paving the way for him to be able to fight his way out of poverty.
Translation:  Holland to Dana "I'll fight Chimaev, if it's 5 rounds and I'm Co-Main."    Dana:  "Deal!" Dana to Li JingLiang:  "Li, I need a partner for Nate. Can you go 5 on Sunday?"  Li:  "I trained for Ferguson, in a 3 round fight, so no.  I'm out."   Dana to Ferguson: "Tony! You wanna punch Nate in the face for 25 minutes?"  Tony:  "I can punch him in the face all night long, D!!" 💢💥💫
Want Diaz to win but I think Tony gonna win via UD
By far my favorite fighter of all time. Toughest, most determined mf to ever walk in the octagon.
Mike tyson of the ufc 🥊
Man he is lucky now he doesn't have to fight cumshot.
No doubt Nate is ready to go out on his shield in this fight. He’s all in nothing to lose. If he wins the legacy grows if he loses he’s still a champion of the people because of his willingness to fight any man anywhere.
Let's go Nate!!!!Legend.Respect.
Nate reminds me of young Mike Tyson you can here the pain in there voice
Nate is a Living Legend 💪
Legend! 🙌🏾
Living legend
My god. My guy talks like Tyson. Respect to the fighter and gl tomorrow
Anyone else think Nate has a Tyson feel post retirement?
i love nate but homie has big time cte brain damage. He cant stop tho its all he knows.
Now upload this interview again uncensored.
Brett sucks
Nate just wants out
Love u nate
I had bet on Nick by Guillotine or Triangle
Nate: “I ain’t surprised motherfuckers”
End this hype machine Nate, this guy gassed out in 3 against Burns, if this fight goes past 3 rounds Nate will win
Realeast MF in the game.
I agree one of the greatest to ever step into the Octagon🦾🪐
Nate I'm just going to say it ! I have been watching UFC since day 1 and Have had a lot of fighter's I liked to watch. But you have been one of the fighters I have truly got excited to watch because win or lose you gave it your all and did not ever waste my money. You are truly a bad mofo! I will only pay for this fight to support you not because I want to support UFC . Ty for all the good fights !
Ufc will not be the same without diaz !
The realist in the game!
In three days this video got 1.6 mil views, 50k likes & 14k comments! That's all Nate Diaz! 💯 the people's Champ 🏆💪🏾🔥
Khamzat didn't want to kill an old drug dude who fights without training Nate. That's why he took Holland
Masonic Theatre, The Whole Switch Thing - But Looking Forward To These Fights.
Diaz is punch drunk. Got asked why he is fighting kamzhat, and he went on a ridiculous rant about nothing. Then he said he is the greatest of all time? Dude beat Conor and he thinks he's the greatest? He couldn't even win his own fake belt.
Thank Christ it’s Nate and Tony now
Another very clear interview by Nate, he has evolved so much with his clarity.
I really hope Nate smokes this dude, Nate deserves way more then he has been givin. I hope Nate shits on the UFC perade, and fucks there future up for this dude. GO KNOCK THE SNOT OUT OF THIS DUDE NATE, u can do this and I truly believe it. 👊🇺🇲🗽🇺🇲👊
Nate is 100% real!!!!
I think Vegas bookies paid khamzat to not cut weight.  The betting odds were nuts.
Well this aged well. He's fighting Tony Ferguson now.
Nate you´re a "legend" before or after the fight!
An khamzat dont make weight. Psssh. Fought one top 10. Gassed and almost koed. Then he cant even make weight. Psssh. Dana pr machine. Nate is the real deal.
I really hope Nate wins and leaves holding up the middle finger all the way to the next chapter in his career.
Diaz Poirier was the fight to make.
we love you nate
Todays weight miss by khamzat was the only way Dana could get Khamzat out of this fight due to the backlash.  You heard it here, khamzat was definitely paid to miss weight.
Nate is a true warrior
Nate Diaz, got the world by the tracheas  In a chokehold and a sleeper
I can totally picture Dana white acting narcissistic like that.
It all makes sense now
This guys cooked
Strong chin gets you a little brain rattled. Ask Chuck Liddell for 99% of his career, now he’s slurring
Tough guy no doubt but dumb as dirt !
Let’s hope it’s Nate and Tony !! What a way to end the ufc career . Two legends.. The gods stepped in and got khamzat out
Win or loose he is the most gangster mother Fer around
Man I love this guys so much
Nate seems like he has brain damage straight up . I can’t be the only that notices it.. yes I know he’s high but still ..
So raw and real
why is the video quality so shitty?
Best interview with Nate ever. I see him a little differently now.
Much respect for Nate but I think he’s had his bell rung one to many times and he needs to get out of the game. Or…he’s just high as a kite. Whatever it is he just seems off.
Come to find out he took this fight to get his 10 teammates contracts with UFC... Dudes a stud mentally and physically.. He could have had an Easy out. Dana's a tyrant for this
He brings the crowd …. Win or loose. He is a good  fighter, entertaining and he never quit.
This guy is the real 🤝💯
Brutally honest one sided conversation.  Nate is getting a lot off his chest and giving us one of the greatest interviews of all time. Kudo's to the interviewer for not interrupting and letting him go. I wonder how many concussions he's had? Brett should have stood when Nate offered his hand at the end of the "interview".
This guy is the UFC,  he's the man.
Nate's not wrong.
I gotta disagree with you there Nate friends help friends make money and if you’re talking about a half $1 billion fight come on now I’ll have some sense
Great interview. That ending was hilarious
As much as I love Nate and his brother but it seems like this guy got hit to hard in 2009 and just got stuck there
him and adesanya would be awesome tho...
What the ufc did is smart as well. They boosted Diaz v. Chimaev and had Ferguson on the card waiting. And then all of a sudden last night Kevin Holland gets into it with Darren till and Khazmat’s people….drama now they’re fighting
Man I hope & pray Nate ruins they plans
My neighbor
Make some money and stay safe nate
Nate and his bulldog face xD
this was a great interview uh brett, i have to go 🤣🤣
I don’t think he Members … member
That's a real O.G. Nate and his brother are some of the best fighter's the ufc has ever had. I like how he's his own man and own champion you never hear no one else saying that. That's the only way to be unless you like being someone else's *itch.
Nate Diaz is the perfect example of when keeping it real goes right
gotta love nate dude is so real
Always made weight, never backed down from a fight and always delivered win or lose. He isn’t going to become a commentator, he isn’t the most articulate but he did his job to the best of his ability. A true warrior
The best out there we love u Nate;)
This is a better exit match for Nate he deserved it. Much respect!!
Let’s not forget when Nate got popped for taking sarms lol
There’s a dude that loves his big brother. That warms my heart
My scenario is that the UFC has hyped khamzat up and built some popular opinion behind him; and every one thinks Nate is the under dog but in reality Khamzat is not that good, he is gonna get beat and Nate is gonna look like a hero
He is the BOAT (The Best of All Time)
Well what happens now...
he still the only white boy the can say Nword he one of the guys  something different there's no one like Nate and he's showing y'all that
This fight might not happen hazmat missed weight.
see he not worried about being a champion he worried about showing people he can stand in front of the biggest and baddest no matter what and it's a lesson behind that to always fight from the heart not for the label he's a real champion regardless of  a belt or a contract he do this s*** from the heart in the best peace  in life come from doing something from the heart
I love Nate, but he's talking some rubbish here - Edwards beat Diaz harder for the first 4 rounds and 4 minutes of their fight, than Usman beat Leon in the first 4 rounds and 4 minutes of their fight - and Nate couldn't finish the job! Diaz is a Top 25 all time IMPO, but he's blowing smoke up his own hoop when he says he's the best ever.
He looks like Robert Dinero.
Leave the guy alone. Its just a fight and he is not doing it to defend his home or country
could have said all this in 3 mins .................... tortuous watch but this is the right fight , this chaps previous regrets are his own fault and he needs to forget that now
Nates had an amazing career and resume to go with it. He's fought the best. Has got the heart of a soldier. However I hope he comes out of this fight safe and gets choked and not knocked out or heart too badly.  Its highly unlikely he wins, khamzat is an extremely talented fighter with brutal hands and mma skills. It will be a good night for UFC.
Nate you mf legend my cousin stay hating on ya but you still my favorite fighter one biggest reason I started watching ufc
Never back down, never count him out…. I am not surprised….
720p ? for real?
Break him down NATE  You got this
Khamzat is 7.5lbs overweight 😂😂😂😂😂
Tony’s gonna get stockton slapped Saturday!!!
Gotta love Nate. Absolute legend of the game
Nobody makes me want to be a fighter more than this 🐐
Everyone looks at records not the fights. This dude fought the best of the best. No slacking.
CTE is REAL
"OOOOOOOOO! WHO THINKS HES A GANGSTER IN THE UFC? PATCHY CHIMAEV!!! WHO'S AFRAID OF NATE DIAZ SO HE MISSES WEIGHT?!?! PATCHY CHIMAEV PATCHY CHIMAEV PATCHY CHIMAEV!!!
Tell it how it is Nate, you are the f$&()”@ man !
Go Nate! You got this!
Is just me , or does Nate Diaz sound alot like Mark Wahlberg in The Departed... or Ben Affleck in The Town? 🤔
How do we get 4chan people to make this guy President?  Nate “I refuse to be lame” Diaz -2024
YES   LETS DO IT NATE!!
Nate a complicated guy but he say how he really feel
I like him as a character but as a fighter I can't understand why he's so highly rated when he's lost as many as he's won ? Bang average poor technique but tough as stone.
Great interview. One of the greatest in the fight game ever. His point comes across. I am a fighter not an athlete coming to fight not to a sporting march. I control my own narrative, thats what brings me longevity. Pretty interesting look into his brain.
Wish Khabib was brought up in this awesome interview!
I hope he doesn’t get injured badly.
Im sorry but million dollar athletes talking about going to "war" is just a slap in the face to any service member that has actually been to war. No Nate, No Lebron, no Mr. Tom Brady...you play a sport. A physical and dangerous one no doubt, but lets stop the war comparisons eh?
Stockton slap FTW!!! 💪💪💪👋👋👋🙌🙌🙌
Blown Johnny Depp Diaz
You fought Burns dawg!  Nate kills me 🤣🤣🤣
Does he always sound like this or he’s a bit punch drunk
The UFC won’t be the same without the Diaz Brothers. I’m hoping Nate destroys.
He’s a OG.  i know I’m paying for Diaz name not this other flash in the pan
I can hardly understand a word he’s says. Is he punch drunk? Something is off with him.
Even if nate lose i dont care,land a stockton slap and its a WIN!
The world is a corporation at this point. Don't forget to get your booster shot💉💰🇺🇸🗽
CRY. BABY. 👶.
To me wrestling fights is a little boring u all know what I am saying were they hunch on each other the whole fight not very exciting style of a fight
I would rather see that fight then usman
I think he is just a bit upset with the ufc I think he wanted a better going out fight but Nate if u win man wow a rematch between u and Leon would be sweet bro
I wonder if he's alittle punch dope u know by the way he talks
He is always gonna be a good show for the fans even if he loses he's always there putting on a show
If he uses steroids let him use steroids,I'll smoke weed and then we'll fight.GO NDA!!
Adhd I got that too lol
Nate is going to submit the goon!!!
Nate is the UFC. Letting him go, will end up being the demise of the UFC legacy in the long run.  -  “Don’t forget what made you”  Slowly all these legends will be gone, but not forgotten. And to replace all of them, is impossible. There won’t be another Nate or Nick Diaz.
I wanna train with Nate!   Diaz - McGregor 3.
can we buy this to stream ?
God dam Nate has been punched in the head too many times.
Jesus christ im sorry will anyone ever address the fact that this guy is possibly fried in the brain?? This guy is struggling with the most simple sentence. Slur is disturbing if you really look at it. Help this dude
If you’re a fight fan and Nate Diaz hasn’t earned your respect yet, I would question if you’re actually a fight fan.
Nate I'll be rooting for you next fight make me some 💰
When the YouTube add is like “I got you bro” 😂
Mount Rushmore: Robert De Niro Al Pacino Leonardo DiCaprio  Adam Sandler
Homie ran and ended his own interview🤣 Brett did a great job. Get that dub Nate!
Nate may have taken one too many to the head?????
He fought burns dawg he fought burns 🤣😆
Should be a great show!!!
"THE FIGHT GAME GOAT"
Riveting
The UFC has been a joke for years
If he doesn’t shock the world his people will as they did in the back room yesterday bfore conference that was canceled
Prop to Nate for doing the interview. You can tell he has so much to say but can’t put all together. I know he is a big underdog going to this fight but I hope he ruins the UFC plans.
Nate should probably focus on healing the body. Probably cutting his life short entertaining a bunch of plebs.
Love him like a little brother. I been watching ufc since the 90s
Should be Diaz vs Ferguson,that would be a good fight
13 Losses...  And Punch drunk
I wish this interview guy would break down some more of what Diaz says. Wish the interview guy would interview.
diaz mma math and mental gymnastics are the best
He threw a bottle as soon as he got back to Vegas 🤣🤣
Brain injury is real
“The most famous actors you can think of.. Adam Sandler” -Nate Diaz   Idk why but that got me laughing 😂
This reporter is trying hard to get a rise out of nd
Skinny Fat Nate beat his opponent on the scale alone. What a world we live in.
i cant take this guy serious he reminds of adam sandler in the water boy
One more thing. Nate F%#^ this dudes lip up worse than it already is, with the soup-bowl chin strap.
Great fighter but he needs to retire, obvious brain damage.
great interview🔥
It’s not a shock if Nate wins people. Dude is a warrior. Cumshot (not looking for correct spelling) has shown he’s got some skill but Nate has faced way better competition. So let’s be serious people
"you do steroids, I smoke weed, let's get in there and squash" - legend.
Anyone have a clue what Nate is even talkin about? Worst vocabulary ever but i love that dude! 😂
I’m having trouble understand the deniro ufc fighter analogy…. Lmao. No one would be looking at BJ or Fedor
Maaaaan we need that  DIAZ vs. masvidal re-match!!!  🥊🛑🥋🛑🥊
Nates the goat after that interview.
Nate is that ole wisdom n respect and practices the art of combat a student of his craft love n respect Diaz army
fkn love Nate Diaz
RE-SIGN!! Pay this man.  When his bros back heals and they headline together…..cmon
I CANT BELIEVE THEY'RE ACTUALLY LETTING A REAL MAN SPEAK ON YOUTUBE!
Nick Diaz and Nate Diaz are both Excellent fighters.. Huge respect for both Brothers. True Brotherhood.. God Bless them both..
I need subtitles bro 🙏
The camera man, earning his money with all Nicks fidgeting hahaha
Pound 4 Pound best to jump in that octagon   🛑 🪢🥊🥋🥊
Nate explained it, this is about making the new guy a hit for the ufc. Making a hit for the machine ( Big Money)
Nate is the definition of LAST MAN STANDING! 🇲🇽 power
Great character, I hope he wins.
This was the realest stream of consciousness of a true warrior i may have ever heard.
Rooting for Nate but Dana white is trying to get him killed smh
Is this guy ok?
9:50 That Usman impression is actually spot on lmao
I don't care if he wins loses draws or doesn't show up, him n his brother ARE the flight game
Nate Diaz 2nd round
He’s a honest person who lived to fight for him. He and Nick loved the sport. Win or lose Nate is a heroic man.
Khamzat will never be in the same league as Nate
“I refuse to be lame” 🐐
I hope Nate has a great night tomorrow!
That was some dope sh*t
I realize that Nate is a kid from the streets and the street has its own, unique, language, but Nate is borderline incoherent. Maybe it's just me, but he seems to be displaying the initial symptoms of  CTE. That may well be the reason the UFC has not renewed his contract.
His usman impression just killed me. 😂
" you take steroids I smoke weed , let's fight" 🤣 real AF
They're doing the same thing to him that they do to Tony Ferguson. Got an upcoming fighter? Ah lets throw this guy in tne fire. If he wins good if he loses good also. The UFC is the only winner 100% of the time.
I hate to say but they’re using Nate as bait, and isn’t getting paid enough even tho each fight is tougher and tougher everytime
Kept it real all the way! We are with you Nate!
I respect the heck out of Nate, but idk something seems off, like if he’s being forced or I get that feeling of he knows the inevitable is coming
A brilliant mind back in the day, one of the most authentic and successful humans on the planet!
Okamoto is the worst interviewer of all time
*Smoke weed every day.* *For your health.* *This is the way.💨🌲🌴*
You can see the fear. He’s so lost in thought.
Don’t back him into a corner and poke him with a stick. Dangerous. Hope he wins.
“If you’re a GOAT, then make a GOAT”
12:39 golden clip
i hope he stops fighting after this. Cannabis is great for a lot of things but idk if it helps CTE
Real
This is Nate’s best interview
Love diaz glad the khamzat fight is off now he came in way too heavy!! Hope nate gets to war we tony and leave as a warrior hopefully with the win as well.
if khamzat goes out there, and all of a sudden he is a leg kick specialist im asking for a refund
Nate Diaz is the UFC at this point
Contradiction after contradiction. Dilutions. He sad he wants to fight “nigganu”. God bless him.
what kind of cameras are these. is this espn? they said heres some flip phones to record with
Nates interviews are such my favourite of any fighter. People say he can't talk, losing brain cells etc..for me he speaks nothing but facts 💯
nobody can deny nate is a tough af, its in his and his brothers blood they will always be ufc legends but he looked unfocused to be, not gonna say scaredor worried, could be hes had a few drinks in the interview but he seems off. Age and hunger is a huge thing in the octagon but hes been at the top and hes nothing left to prove. I think Khamzat will likley win and although Nate can take some damage i feel a little worried for him. That said I would love him to win !!!!
Nate Diaz the peoples Champ
Nate vs. the UFC narrative.
I can watch this all day
Nate not exactly looking sharp these days he need to stop the weed and get back to some sort of normality for any chance against the like of  chimeav nate  deserves a decent pay day Hope Nate wins 🏆
Will Nate retire after this?
"I'll see you next time"? Hmm...
Nate is one of those beloved fighters like Chanel sonnen we don’t even care if he wins, we’re still gonna love them!
Idk if it’s CTE or he’s just really high.. probably both.. love the guy tho. he is a champ of champs.
Nate 60 years old wow
dude hes crying, it's alreaedy over.
Hé looks liké de Niro...
You've gotta respect him for always being real. "Thats what I do!" What a legend! He's gonna smash this guy if the fight even goes ahead.... Screw all the haters... Behind you all the way Nate!!!!!
This line of questioning seems so feminine..brett is a girl
Fk yeah Nate!
he speaks so clearly and his sentences are so cohesive. I feel like he can be a great poet after his UFC carrer.
I think this is probably the best Nate interview I've watched seems like he was holding a lot of stuff in
TY NATE FOR EVERYTHING!! U ALWAYS THE BOSS! 👊🏻😎🖤
people who wanna see both of them fight are not people. Both are proud men and someone * wants to kill this honor and pride and a never ending story. He should follow Muhammad Ali, Tyson and Habib and let it go because they will not let him go
I'm a Diaz fan but man he has some mental gymnastics when it comes to rankings lol
Sad to see the cognitive damage.... when he's 60 he's toast
Loved the interview. Respect to Brett. Who just conducted him so well by giving the legend all the time he needed.  Your the best there is or ever will be, you were always a champion. Best of luck brother.
NATE DIAZ JUST BEAT WHATEVER HIS NAME IS AT THE WEIGHT IN!!!🏆💯💯💯
Years ago I thought he was telling a lot but not saying a thing.....now it's the other way around. Always your biggest fan! Nate is a Boss!!!
Why does the quality look so bad and why is it 720p
I wish his last fight was him vs conor trilogy, not doing him dirty by feeding him to grow the chimaev hype machine
Nate is a Champ!
Nate been taking the brunt of BS from UFC/Dana  N he been speaking facts
realist to do this sh!t
Man feel like they're doing Nate so dirty with this fight. I hope he throws down with everything he's got, I expect it.
Nate's right , the brothers don't conform to the UFC mold .  But I'm still a huge Diaz fan
This interview was great, cool to see Nate lower the walls a little bit, definitely a real one. Nothing but respect for Nate, where he's come from and what he has accomplished. We got a look at his true self, I really hope he can come in with his best and Khamzat doesn't just come in and try to lay on him. "You do steroids, I'll smoke weed and we can get in there and squab." -ONLY Nate DIaz
16:27 you fought Burns Dawg 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Guaranteed he lives by the sword and dies by the sword, give his friends the shirt off his back, and is the realest mfr on the planet.  Love this guy
All the energy leading towards this fight leads to Nate. Khamzat missed weight, is way too over emotional and will gas!
Serious Tyson vibes here
Awkward way for an interviewer to sit, it's as if he's trying to project his alpha-male energy toward a cynical 'i'm over this b.s.' looking Nate lolol..
You are the best fighter ever Khamzat Chimaev couldn't even make weight
I believe Nate is going to shock the world.
GOAT
Nate ftw. I’m not surprised mother fuckers
Nate Diaz and Mike Tyson give off the same energy.
Why’s he complaining and mumbling when he’s the “best guy in the ufc” 😭😭😭
Nate’s a real one
SEND ME HOME I MISS PEOPLE AT HOME!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nate Diaz Army!! Can’t say enough good things about both brothers!! Can’t wait to see what he does next
Nate Diaz will always be one of the GOAT's
God bless you Diaz
I hope nate steps back from fighting and goes into something more chilled , my guy looks like he needs a hug
Nate Diaz! 209! Let’s Go!
Nate is high as a mo fukka
Nate you earned my respect, a strieght beast no matter what happens you earned a fan here
My fav fighter in ufc
He looks more and more like his brother
Real Chechen Gangster will humiliate Nate on his way out the door.
the thing is when he says hes the best fighter what he means is literally  fight me outside lets see who can last me or you
Khamzat missing weight is rooting for Diaz even more. Let’s go Diaz!
Doesn’t matter  Nate has always been my favorite  Been watching for 20+ years  Fk your bandwagon
The only thing about him going into free agency is the fact that no promotion is gonna pick up all his guys.. That’s just not gonna happen haha
Im pretty baked right now but Nate seems like hes goin through it.. never seen him in an interview like this before
Team Nate all day but I worry about his brain injuries his slurred speech makes me sad.
If Nate’s fighting skills matched his verbal skills, he’d be in serious trouble.
Nate hit it on the head, UFC is just trying to put Khamzat as the new baddest dude and they want Nate to be the fall guy
Nate is about to get humbled.
Maybe Nate would be better at texting
He's not a bad guy tbh Marikhuana guy is aight.
he is on weedroids
Nate Diaz interviewed himself lmao
This interview was scheduled for 10 minutes
Nate’s got nothing to loose at this point. He’s already dominated, won fights, and shocked the world. Nate is already a legend regardless. Chimaev may be skilled but who’s more dangerous? The man who’s got something to prove or nothing to loose? This match up is more even than most think. Could go either way. It only takes 1 great move and game over.
I'm sorry but this fight should not take place. He's proven himself already. Retire. You're a hero already
Love nate hope he does that cxxt in...
Nate is a legend
Team Diaz and Ferguson all the way!!!
Nate deserves a fight with nganou after this for sure
Do it one last time Diaz. “I’m not surprised motherfucker$.” Respect.
Brett is an awesome interviewee and he's perfect for an interview with Nate
I love NATE DIAZ. 💋 JON JONES AND NATE DIAZ FOREVER...
Fedor Malenko, my favorite MMA fighter!
I'VE NEVER SEEN NATE DIAZ THIS BROKEN AND CONFUSED WHILE PUTTING ON THAT SAME TOUGH SHIELD ON HIM.   REMINDS ME OF CONOR AFTER KHABIB'S FIGHT .HMMM
Big fan on Nate and Nick, met Nick in vegas... pretty cool experience. Pulling for Nate on this one!
A man with nothing to lose is a dangerous man! Praying for the upset.
Nate & Nick Bad boy goats, for sure, been a fan since forever.
Nate for the big W
Nate respects his cholos (homies) more than Champion fighters CTE is real
When was the last time Nate Diaz won a UFC fight?
Man makes me sad man cause this guy's came a long way nate my dude man hope he wins and shows the ufc what's up and shuts them up
Dear Nate,we love you....
I love Nate to death such a good guy but I don't think he even knows what he's mad at
The best to ever do it 🙌🏼 down
Nate Diaz you just shook Up the world. "hey I'm not surprised mther fuckers"
4m into the interview and I absolutely hate the interviewer comeon man you keep on asking the same questions and expending them like chewing a gum get to the point
"WHAT".......enough said.
Nate finds a way to win and spits on the UFC logo 🤞🤞🤞
I’m nervous for dude, this gonna be a rough fight
Was cool to hear Leon is such a big fan of Nate. Nate is a ufc legend
@11:04 “after my 5th fight, I think I got like 29 fights in the ufc…” - Nate Diaz
down syndrome is not funny
I REFUSED TO BE LAME!!!! 🏆
I love Nate like i love my homies being real means more than anything
Nate is the only real one in the UFC
That 29:28 mark 🤣🤣🤣. Legendary!!! Sitting. There like school kids
Hopefully he wins and says “F*CK YOU DANA”
Bro at 8:00 ….. my man Nate spitting facts!! People’s champ. Never changed on his homeboys either
Am I the only one who sees a clear case of CTE in Nate? Listen to how he gets lost for words. That ain't from weed. That's from head trauma.
I loved the way he said " if your on steroids, it's out of the question being goat" 🤣🤣🤣 hilarious
Nate is so real. I love him.
Shock the world. I'm not surprised again mferz, and then fight Jake paul and get your retirement bread.
Nate you are one of a kind ...you Just Doo it...shot the wolf....win or loose dosent matter ...you R a Legend...best of luck..
You cant take anything away from Nate Diaz. It's been so sick following his entire career, and Nick's. LEGENDS
nates a savage a true fighter fights anyone anytime much respect
Imagine Diaz Stockton slapping khamzat and pulling the “I’M NOT SURPRISED MFS “
This Man is a Goat/Legend he deserves everything UFC Dana take care of this give him a big payout and if this his last fight man he’s needs a payday UFC will be lost without him OG in the game.
Awesome, gotta love it
A large part of Nate is jealousy. That is unfortunate! Usman is a great fighter
Nate unfortunately is going to lose bad. Pay check for the high way.
He said Rory marker 🤣 I think he meant Rory McDonald
I watched 25 seconds to conclude that, this is the fakest mofo interviewing the realest mofo & is lame.
that's how the moneys made nate... it's not a lie it's a show.  for nate its a sport ...for dana its show business....  dana made it happen ...took it mainstream... he deserves respect  nate is in my hall of fame with Fedor Emelianenko gracies the guy fom the last dragon....sho nuff
Bro, I ain't gon' lie, when these guys talk, It takes extra brain cells to process what they're saying.
Baddest Mf on the planet
Much respect to the editor of this clip.
The reason Nate is so mysterious in his answers is because he has a secret that he has sworn by blood not to let loose. Clones, dream consciousness tech, all sorts of crazy stuff :]
Great fighter but not interesting to listen to.
I rock with Nate but you straight up hating on Usman
Nate is looking AND acting more like Nick
16:29 how i feel whenever my cuhzzin dont pick me to hand out snacks for the class.🤣😂
I heard reports of military disruption ever since the Nate Diaz army has been making movement in certain territorys
“I refuse to be lame” legendary words from Nate, you’re the man.
Nate ain't never worried , you can tell this mf got no receding in his hairline and got no hair loss 😂 he ain't stressing EVER
I hope one day he ends up like Mike Tyson and finds peace and the appreciation he deserves, he’s been through a lot and deserves his place at the top.
I've never seen an interview with Nate, when talking about the best fighter ever, that he fails to put his brother in the top spot.
Nate winning would make my year. But recalling how dominant Masvidal was against Nate I can't even let myself go there.
YOU SHOULDA WORKED ON A COMPUTER SOMEWHERE YA NERD! HAHAHA
Feels like Rocky vs Ivan Drago in Rocky IIII  🥲
Haha if ur the goat then make a goat  Amen 🙏
Nate will start bleeding after one punch 🤦🏾‍♂️😂🥹
Bro Nate kept it so real it’s crazy
When you make more money than any current champion you are a champion. Undeniable.
He really thinks he beat Leon?🤣 he was getting whooped for 24 minutes he landed one shot & didn’t even go for the finish Diaz & his fans are so delusional
Basically I don't want the SMOKE! But you better Make sure you SMOKE me because I'm Not Backing Down from ANYONE!!  If thats NOT GANGSTA!! What is?? Even if Khamzat WINS!! He will Never be Nick and NATE DIAZ G!! 👊🏾
Just stay on your feet, when you get caught is all I gotta say. Don't talk tough or like you're the best ever when you've always turned into a turtle everytime you get caught across your jaw.
Nate doesn’t want leave he’s got passion for the fight game, one way or another he’ll still be in it until the end of time.
I know it's not good to go into a  fight with emotion but this is a little different. Nate is here to prove a point and tbh i think this will be a great fight.
I don’t even watch the U.F.C any more.but if Nate fights I’ll watch. The sellout U.F.C screws the fighters now so they are not worth the money.  Rebox is a$$how screwing fighters is the way of the U.F.C. E.S.P.N is worthless to.
Hope Nate goes out on top. A REAL WARRIOR!
Anyone who asks why nate talks like that. His nose is broken and was never fixed. He always had a slight lisp but the clogged nose makes it way worse. It's not so much cte.
I like Nate, but he took way to many shots to the head. If fight goes down, Nate could submit him, he is not just some BJJ black belt, he is Gracie black belt. But if he stand and trade punches he will lose..
Nate 💪💪
Get Adam Catteral from BT Sports doing these interviews. Who’s this dude in the pasty shirt trying his hardest…?!
Nate is not dumb. He is actually smart he just has trouble articulating himself and his thoughts properly. A fighter who gave his life to the UFC, to be thrown to a literal wolf. Sad man.
NDA till the wheels fall off
he just deserves a tittle shot. not a gangster from Zweden. hope he wil win and put his 🖕🏻to UFC and say “i'm not surprised motherfuckers”
I wish nate for win
As much as I love Khamzat. I would LOVE to see Dana’s face if Nate Diaz beats him and then the UFC is left at Nate’s feet begging him to stay.
He can’t even talk
If anyone can upset any fighter at anytime, it’s Nate Diaz. I mean, he almost finished the current Welterweight champion who just beat P4P best Usman.
Imagine Borz gassing cause he has an adrenaline dump and Nate pieces him up 🤣
True about all the steroids  even though it's prevalent in all sports with top athletes  who've used them.
Why do i think he is depressed
That dude isn't humble one bit always comes off like he needs to put up front him and his brother
I was excited for this until I saw Brett doing the interview
I love Nate, but something wrong with his talk and how his mouth moves
Look at that, another example of Brett Okamoto being a moron. Out here trying to correct Nate on when he fought Cowboy. Do your homework Brett, it’s gonna catch up to you.
Spitin that hotfire
1.2m views xD lets go xD
I hope this is a massive payday for Nate.  He has earned this and is one of a kind.
I feel so bad for how the UFC has treated Nate and Nick over the years. Nate is essentially saying over the years he didn’t follow the WWE-esk narrative that Dana put forward.. Nate is absolutely right all these fighters who keep the belt for a couple fights are all of the sudden the new GOAT lol … Nate is the GOAT years of smashing and never backed down … I put a good bet on him to win and if it goes past the 2nd Nate could absolutely beat Kazmat…. Let’s go Nate!!!
Nate is one of the guys that made UFC this big. Nate should fight for the title. Can’t wait to see you get the W!!
Mma has evolved into more tactical / business like. Og's like nate straight bang & go to war. Rare breed!
Can't wait to watch it tomorrow, rooting for Nate Diaz!
Real talk!
Is it me or has his speech patterns completely changed , as I def don't remember him having a lisp which he seems to have now
How old is Nate?  By the time he's in his 50's, he will be a catatonic vegetable.  He can barely speak clearly.
“You do steroids, I’ll smoke weed. Let’s get in there and squab”.. ufc is losing one of the greatest
Combat sports take there toll on the brain u see it all the time watch interviews when they start and when they finish these guys really sacrifice themselves for our entertainment I give it to Nate they r trying to smash him off at the end of his career that's how much Dana and the high ups care should have give em a equal fight pay him well and wish him well....but instead dude might seriously injure Nate ...I'd love to see Nate win but for real the sun is setting should not feed him to the wolves after all hrs done
I honestly didn't understand 90% of this interview
Great guy but braindead
He does have 2 advantages going in if you ask me.  1. Hes tough as nails, no quit in him at all. If you think otherwise, your just wrong.  2. Very good cardio, and experience of 5 round fights. I'm sure there's others but those ones stand out to me as particularly important. If he's gunna pull it off I think he's gotta get him to the 4th or 5th, and when he's tired and they're on the ground, sink in one of his slick submissions.
Best of luck Nate really hope you win you can never be broken
I hope that Nate slaps Dana after his fight in front of all the cameras then walks off
Nate diaz is awesome
He makes no semse contracdicts himself around every corner, so what if he is a badass he is starting to sound crazy
NO ONE.... has brought THE PRESIDENT of the United States of America to a fight.... But NATE.
Amazing guy, too bad he is a junkie.
I love nate, but I feel like my IQ has dropped at least 10 points after watching this 🤔
I got Nate winning by Guillotine in the 2nd round.
The Diaz brothers have the N word pass💯
GETEM NATE!!! DIAZ ARMY BEHIND YOU...FOREVER!!!
The end got  me laughing so hard... I got to go Bret, it was great interview 🤣🤣
Nate poured it out…he’s stayed the same, didn’t change his look, just remained himself… the goat baaaaaaaaa
Nate never runs out of energy.  He is the energy grid in the MMA world
I hope the people can see now how dirty the UFC is. Instead of giving Nate the fight that he wants, they continue to puss the kamzat fight in order to build him into a star.
People that say he's not all there and he had to many head blows are crazy.
Straight Warrior!
Go get’m Nate - on tough cookie
Best Nate interview yet!!! This is why he has his cult following.
I really believe  nate  should be fighting leon for the belt. But ufc dropping the billion dollar ball.
ESPN MMA uploading 720p videos?  What year is it?  ESPN MMA need to fix this.
Thank you for Sharing Nate.
Legend man.
Nate is the King. Regardless of who holds the gold.
HE'S THE TOUGHEST FIGHTER OF ALL TIME.... PERIOD.
Not a fan , but i must admit ,,i would love to see  Diaz destroy all of their big plans with Khamzat , that would be hilariuos . GO DIAZ  .
Let’s go, Nate. ❤️
Guys if you listen carefully , Nate talks very close to how Mike Tyson does. Nate is the real deal. I don't care what anyone says but this man is a badass. Don t forget he rocked Leon and even if Chimaev, who I also like,  wins I don't care. As a soldier myself , I would take a bullet for Nate.
WHAT A BANGER INTERVIEW & MUCH RESPECT TOO BRETT FOR LETTING HIM TALK TO 🤘🏽🔥
the cte is real and sad
his mind is so in the past it's ridiculous, he thinks he can't be played bu the ufc but it's exactly what they're doing atm
Respect Nate is a Legend!👍
I’m 3 minutes in and it’s tough seeing Nate get emotional 😭
With all due respect, he's in denial now. He knows his time is almost over and deep down he knows he hasn't truly accomplished what he wanted. Now he's constantly livkng in the past. The business has changed and he can't accept that.   It's not about "give me whoever ladidada"  you haven't fought in years and guys who are coming up are using you to gain momentum, accept you're a pawn now and you got used.  Every pre fight interview is him going "give me whoever I'll fight anyone and that means I'm the best", yes that's admirable but it's not how you play the game anymore Nate.
Let's go nate 🫀
He is old now he probably should retire while he still has his legacy
All i hear is excuses . U said u asked fr lw top 5, u got ww top 3 . What’s the difference? U got the weight advantage here at welterweight right? Why are u pretending like ufc is doing something against ur will ? Shut up nate .
Great one sided interview. Nate’s a true American outlaw… Brett has zero substance and lazy energy. Whatever Nate chooses to do he’s made his mark on the sport 💯
I think Nate don't like Bret
derp
Why is Mighty Mouse never mentioned in goat conversations? It's crazy!
"The pressure's on you, motherfucker"
Ayyyoo chill, I work behind a computer 😭
"You're being their champion...I ain't nobody's champion." Real talk 💯
Lets be real. Hes good but hes not the same who beat mcnugget. Its long time ago, stop overhype him
Wow. Listening to this was like my 4 year old telling me how his day was. Lots of words, couldn't make much sense of it though.
ESPN can't afford to film in 1080 😂
Khamzat for the win, but you can't help but have mad respect for Nate , such a humble guy. Doesn't deserve the disrespect from Dana and the UFC
Nate is a really nice guy I like how he thanked Brett for listening to him
Love this Guy,  COnor vs  Diaz 3  i like to see
Great in-depth interview, and Nate broke the fight game all the way down. WAR DIAZ!
Nate is proof that hard work and time is a powerful recipe.  God i hope he wins
Gil 180 BX NATE IS THE MAN 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😎😎😎😎🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
No matter what Nate will still be a legend of the sport, the Diaz Bros. Legacy will always be remembered.
Does Nate have some punchy stuff going on or is normal speak
LOL " I refuse to be lame" There goes our legend. We'll miss you sir.
5:50 The giants of mma
Congrats to Brett for getting Nate rolling. Perfect interview
Nate is a legend.
I don't like foul language. Unssubed.
i hope nate pulls off a miracle.
Censoring Nate is a loss to everyone. Get the kids out of the room. Why does my freedom to hear the man's speech need to be taken?
Sadly this man is getting rekt saturday night... Its gonna be a sad scene.
That dude's not gonna want to stand with Diaz. He'll get peppered all night, he gonna take Diaz down all night.   Also, lol on Diaz talking about Jones on his steroids use, you do steroids and I'll smoke week lmao  Real one, great interviews. That 1st Diaz vs Mctap press conference was epic.
how can an awkward dude hold down an interview job
This was surprisingly difficult to watch.
Probley the best UFC interview I've seen In a long time or possibly ever.Your a Legend Nate!
Nate phx az standing behind you brother!!!! Any man can appreciate the heart this man has respect bro!!!💯💯💪💪✌️
Nate has nothing at all to lose here yet everything to win. If he wins, I will probably lose my voice from screaming
I feel bad for Nate, he has lost his ability to think clearly.
he really is under valued.
Why doesn't he want this fight? Is it because he doesn't believe khamzat is high up enough in the rankings?
The goat
I can kind of understand him and follow but it’s not easy.  He’s def been hit too many times in the head.
Nate .you can do this - my 2 toughest fights i had to do i knew i would lose -i won them both!!!!
Bless you Nate!
I hope Nate is slightly scared for a change as this extra boost of adrenaline will give him the edge. Come on Nate we want you to go to war and prevail! I don’t think there is one fighter in the UFC that would object to Nate having the best heart in the game!!
True legend of the sport.
Nate Diaz The Greatest!
This is the realization of a career coming to an end and his own company screwing him over for all he's done for the company. Really sad to see.
My top 3 favorite fighters.. 1. Diego Sanchez 2. Nate Diaz 3. Donald Cerrone
He's too brain damaged to have a single shot.
Nate’s a g
Nah that's was the realest right there, one  STOCKTON slap and I'll consider nate the winner no matter what happens.
Feedor milaneko 5:40
I REALLY HOPE NATE PULLS THIS OUT
Doesn’t know how to say drunk so he says it in Spanish lmao
Nate Diaz is a different kind of fighter. After the first Conor fight it was never about the result of the fight but it was about the fight itself. An exciting fight is a win for Diaz as his stock grows, a boring fight is an L. Hence, the dude takes no L’s, just keeps participating in exciting fights, keeps growing in popularity, the result of the fight means nothing.
720p?
Wow….. he always seems so bitter and like he really struggles to explain himself…… the idea that it’s scripted is absolute rubbish and he knows it….. I really don’t follow why people like him. He reminds me of vittori, blind to his own flaws, and never learning…. he’s so delusional
this card is messed up,it shld be DIAZ X FERGUSON , Khamzat X Leech. DIAZ POWER FOREVR
I wouldn't want to play with Nate's guard, his sub game is deadly...  I suspect this will take place on the feet, where Nate has a decent chance
Man conor gave this fool brain damage.
I literally put my money on Nate. Win or lose its Diaz Army 4 Life
Nate’s one of them guys that at first you think he’s not all there but when he opens up you realize how aware and wise he is. When he opens up you realize how deep of a thinker he is. He’s like Mike Tyson in that regard.
This is going down as a classic moment in Sports history , Tupac of combat sports!
Good on the interviewer for letting the champ talk.
209 keeping it real 👊
"IM MY OWN CHAMPION"
Nate is so right about what he said concerning Anderson Silva and Jon Jones about the goat status... I know lots will disagree but you can't cheat and be the goat period.
Man watching him its like watching someone who really has some inner war . Nate is something else .what a strange but wonderful human i am watching
@15:10 real G💯 @17:10 , @24:02 lol
Sook
The Diaz brothers are smart talented and work hard amd give back.  Toughness doesn’t just happen it’s life and they are helping kids to see sports not just fight, a future.
He will do comebacks, everyone does
Can someone translate
I honestly can’t stAnd this Brett dude as the interviewer his questions suck
UFC only made this fight because Nate wants out. He feels disrespected and I am on his side. I hope he pulls it off.
Did Dana film this with his phone?
Nate is always real.
13:58 Nate calls it. This fight is all about Dana making Khamzat
Why does Nick look depressed/down in this interview?
So lame that you mute the swearing. You're interviewing fighters!
You ever watch a person realize what level of violence is about to be addressed on him?  He knows throughout this interview its about to be a display that he is nothing more than a has-been.  I respect his previous fights, but he has dropped a bunch of fights and he knows in his heart that he I washed up and that's it.  He compares himself to the fighters that are done....he knows.
Nate and Nick are so uncomfortable doing interviews its like they don't get it ppl love them and care what they think its cool to speak on your greatness they are legends not just fights
Nate isn't all there anymore.
I’m a supervisor at my job. I have a guy who struggles to get his thoughts out like Nate. It drives me insane
Iv always been a fan of Nate Diaz his fighting style is my favorite to watch he has a style very few can throw down like him. Win or lose  he will go down as one of my favorite ufc fighters of all time . Fuckem up this Saturday Nate surprise the world bro
This interviewer sucks
bubbling with a lid on
*Diaz Army 209*
I dont know what it is watching nate in this interview makes me feel emotional cuz iv been watching him and his brother from the beginning it mad respect hope he shocks the world 💯
People in these comments are acting like Nate is about to be sent to the electric chair. “ he was so loved” 😭
Man I hope Nate wins. Khamzat rubs me the wrong way and needs to be humbled.  Nate looks depressed or very nervous
Real Top G Nate Diaz > Andrew Tate
Nate needs to go on Hot Boxin with Mike Tyson
"This was a great interview Brett but I has to go."  Never change, Nate. Never change.
Man, I fux with Nate Diaz. I feel for him. He’s real as it gets. I hope he wins. Either way his brand wins. Nuff respect Nate Diaz. Bless up.
Come on Nate... Stomp that fool.. We're rooting for ya!
Greatest interview in MMA history.
5:00 Brett: Lots of fighters… why Khamzat? Nate: Imagine ur in a mall…
You can judge a man’s lack of intelligence if he says “you know what I’m sayin’?” after every sentence.
I fuq with Nate but he needed stop it . Talking bogus
You do steroids I’ll smoke weed and let’s get in there squab - Nate Diaz
Is it just me or Nate now sounds and talks like Mike Tyson
Nate Diaz is such a Legend 🔥
The Realest... 💪🏻💯💯💯👍🏻
The end was perfect 😂
He has a strong chin. Nate takes punches and never quits. I really hope he wins. Good straight forward dude. Nothing but respect for him
33:28 for nate diaz to say “this was a great interview”  had to really be a great interview‼️ Youre a legend now brett
Thank God that Brett is a good enough interviewer to know to keep his mouth shut and just let Nate speak.  Some of the best interviews ever were when Nate Diaz is allowed to speak his mind without being interrupted.  Nate Diaz is the realest mf in the game. Doesn't give 2 fks. Says and does whatever he wants.  And we all love him for it.  Cannot wait for saturday!!!
209 represent.
I wish they would put Nate an Leon in again
Usman brother vs nick Diaz
Whats he on?
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐‼️
Nate was right it was Brock vs overeem
30:55 🤣
Is is just me or Nate feels like he’s upset or careless or fighting just be puse he has to in order to finish contract
Perfect example of a nut head , too  much , coke n  cali weed
I would think it feels way better being the underdog. Less pressure you really can't lose because everyone expects you to not win. But if you do it's huge. Go in focused.
CTEEEEEE
Nate is the real TOP G 🙌
Yall cant afford a HD camera? Up yalls game
Nates the quote  "keep them guessing".
why is the video quality so low?
this quickly turned into a therapy session
Fighters Like the Diaz brothers, Chuck Liddell, Anderson Silva built the UFC, but the UFC brass sold the brand to the Networks with the Faces of fighters like Brian Stan, Chris Weidman, Tim Kennedy, etc. IMHO, The Diaz Brothers deserve 20 million a pop and first ballot half of fame induction immediately!
great interview. please fix the audio
Nate you are the badest ever. You showed yourself when you beat pretty boy twice. Yes you won the second fight. Love ya brotha.
I really like Nate, but he definitely has ADHD... 100%
Dude Is punched drunk  😞
Nate😎💨🤘
Everyone hates on Bret. It's bogus. Got to say thank you for just letting Nate talk man that's the best form of respect.
Nate has been a warrior from the start ! No questions asked bro has been in battles other fighters wish Can happen to them. Bro created a legacy and forever will be one of the most interesting fighters. Real life gladiator ⚔️💯
Only there for the paycheck not to win..
Time to shock the world again Nate!
Nate (I’ll fight all them in 5 seconds) Diaz.
I won't be surprised mutha fukers
You do steroids I’ll smoke weed 😎I’ll still fight you Nate the goat
i feel bad that he cant leave in his terms
true about jon jones
Pays respect to Leon I hope Diaz wins
Needed this
209
It will be hard to replace Nate I hope he wins
Nates full of himself! Hes def not the best fighter
Reminder kids. Don't do drugs!
It wont happen but it would be great if Nate submits or knocks out Khamzat
DIAZARMY
Love always to Nick and Nate Diaz.
Bro cause ur such a genius nate lol. Just keep getting smashed in the head and become dumber by the day. Stop tryna discredit great mix martial artists like usman. Hes a champ. You just a hater that gets his head bashed in.  CTE TO THE FULLEST
Nobody talking about how Nate looks and acts like he's jacked up on Mountain Dew...or somethin'
Baddest mfr ever right there,  win, lose or draw, everybody respects him.  Absolute warrior mentality. Period.
His fans want him to keep fighting yet they don't care about his health especially his mental health. This man is has suffered serious brain damage, it's obvious by his slurred speech the inability to remain attentive or remember events.
THE BIG DAWWWGGG NATE DIAZZZ BEST TO EVER DO IT!!!! SMASH HIM BROTHER AND GIVE IT TO THE UFC!!!!! LETTTSSS GOOOO!!!!
Why does nate sound more and more like Mike tyson every fight
Great Interview from the goat
This is a good fight because on paper Nate should lose. But...you can never count Nate out and he has pulled some crazy s**t before. People forget Nate has hands and is a BJJ blackbelt. So he can pull off an upset standing or on the ground.
Nate is finished for good khamzat is gonna destroy him fuk him up badddd!! Khamzat will shock the world in that way
legend
Nate’s a straight D.F 👎🏼
this interviewer,  Brett Okamoto, was not my favorite, he was on a different frequency than Nate. More of a showbiz vibe, just not the kind of guy Nate would probably ever sit down and talk to outside the structure of commercial fight promotion. That being said I feel for him, I hope he makes guap & finds a way to forge a path in life that he doesn't find himself "always at war."
Feels like I've been going to war for a long time. I know what he means.
NATE DIAZ WILL WIN 💪🏼
High anxiety. Watch the movements and the shaky voice. He’s most likely in fight or flight mode at most times.
Nate is just saying the truth. He knows is a business. Just giving all fans the real inside.  All respect best wishes
Nate moves the needle in ppv for his fights
Rocky BalDiaz
It’s like an 11 year old trying his best to express himself
The ufc wants a new era Nate to fill the gangster persona. So they are lining up khamzat to hopefully fill that void. But nobody can replace Nate because it’s not a persona it’s who he is it’s not an act. I do have to say I truly hope this is Nate’s last fight. I know part of it is from being camera shy but you can tell fighting has took it toll on him. He put his body on the line to take care of his family and it shows.
Real fighter right here, win or lose, he doesn’t lose his self confidence
“and Adam Sandler”.
if they opened nates head they would find JELLO
Nate is my fav fighter all time but does it seem like he’s not at peace? He sounds a lot like the old Mike Tyson (his voice too!😂) What does he need for acceptance because he sure as F needs nothing from ANYONE! The UFC without the Diaz brothers is like the WWE without Flair and Hogan, boring and just a bunch of Athletic machines with little heart and personality.
Imagine Nate pulls a last round upset submission and retires right after
I am a fan of this guy. Bit if I had the choice of being a normal healthy individual with moderate intelligence or this guy, I would choose the former. Nate is damaged. He’s made some silly choices in life with the wrong priorities

I love Nate Diaz but he is as deluded as a chocolate fireplace... HOWEVER, I hope this kid goes out on a win, more than anyone. And then stick it to the UFC

As always real G right there , get the job done this is war , NDA all the way …….. mexico 🇲🇽 support real street Fighters
Alot of these idiots in the comments are new and it shows
That Kamaru Usman expression was priceless! 😆
Love the Diaz Brothers the realist Nate this interview was 💯 and you are the 🐐
respect
Love Nate. He’s sniffing his finger like he tangled with some sweet puss.
Timestamp 32:25 "I refuse to be lame "
This interview is a instant classic.
This is sad 😔 Dana white sending him to die 😢
He definitely has brain damage
Nate will never have a problem finding work. He speaks from the heart and is a fan favorite. Should be a good one on Saturday!!
he is going to war with the org i hope he wins kinda
They won't let Diaz fight the top guys he wants to because the UFC has plans for these guys and they know Nate will beat that azz and ruin them so called plans💯 Nate is the best by far, but has been held down most of his career!
Seriously that close to brain dead it’s not funny
@natediaz Straight G
Haha
I haven't been this excited for a match since Hogan vs Warrior. N that was scripted. Rare that I like both competitors.  I just can't wait
Diaz Army coming through. So many people claim to be hard, this dude is the .0001% who are about that action. Greatest upset of all time on the way!!! Nate will drown him in 4-5.
Nate and Nick Diaz are the people's Champs! Always and forever champs! best UFC fighters to walk the planet
I love the gigantic chip on his shoulder that Nate has always had & will always continue to have no matter what happens. The confidence is awe-inspiring
No matter what u gotta love how Nate always keeps it real
Brain damage…. Poor guy.
Nates the realist dude ever in the ufc . He and his bro are the "blueprint" of what a real fighter is . Can never be duplicated .  Real legendary  humans 🙌
Let’s go Nate!!!!
Love this guy! The true GOAT 🐐
Nate Diaz talks like he’s been hit with a bat a couple thousand times
Inverviewer walkin on eggshells 😂😂
GOAT
I feel like he was trying to prove he was a 🐐 an honestly he didn’t need to Nate has so much heart I hope he don’t just lay down for this dude
I bet this dude could put in a great days work on the farm! He’s farmin tough 💪🇺🇸
Nate can bang or choke you out!!! Khamzat is tough but Nate ain't no punk!!
Holy cow, the brain damage..... he's barely coherent. So sad to see. But it's the warrior curse. And there has been no greater warrior than Nate Diaz. "I've never been champ." BS You will always be the people's champ.
Bmf
I don't know who Nate Diaz is or do I care. Why did YouTube put this in my suggestion?
Is it just me or is the video quality terrible?
I love this guy! Got mad heart ❤️  Has he taken too many shot though?? Makes me wonder about his mental health in future. Should be more rules in place to protect these warriors. Because they have too much passion to call quits themselves 👊
He’s stoned 2 da gillz
Nate Diaz goat 🐐
We love you Nate
The disrespect from all these people who think it’s a given that Nate will get destroyed… It’s like we all forgot that just a few months ago he almost knocked out the current Welterweight champ. Nate Diaz has shocked the world before. Here’s hoping he’s got one more in the tank for old time’s sake.
Nate finally won me over with this...  Hope he pulls off an upset and hits the glory jackpot !!!
🇺🇸
incredible interview, Nate you got this!
If there was anyone that could epitomize the word, "warrior", it's Nate Diaz.  I tell my young son often that he should watch Nate Diaz to understand the essence of what a REAL fighter is.  Khamzat, after this fight will know what it means to be in a REAL fight.  Nate Diaz, the legend always!
Wouldn't be surprised if he smoked a blunt before this interview LOL
The great Nate Diaz the fighters fighter. Great interview My money is on Nate all the way.... You go boy
Khamzat for win
This interview is something else. Nate is ranting, and body language tells a lot. He’s angry, frustrated, and probably feels some fear for his future. Hang in there Nate, we are rooting for you.
Nates Goat
I fking loved he called out the steroids bs. Fk jones
We love you Nate!!! Diaz army 4L!!!
If your a Goat make a Goat!!  Epic line!
Nate I have always been a fan for you and your brother! Good luck you got this!
He doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me most of the time but he is real.
If Diaz somehow pulls off a upset. The goat herders will blow up after. Khamzat doesn't seem stable enough to handle a loss especially to diaz
Man he might seem like he doesn’t care too much about this fight but once he gets in that octagon that dawg will come out. 4th round Submission..
Say what you want. Diaz brothers are warriors. This cat is still dangerous
Nate will always be the man!! That’s my guy!!
jesus christ it's jason bourne!
Pov: When the edibles kick in.
👏👏👏👏🙌
He makes a lot of sense if you listen. But you got to really listen.
"I refuse to be lame" sums up Nick and Nate 100%
209
notice khamzat called everyone out besides Izzy ? this is pretty bold of the ufc to put a 15 year vet on his way out with possible brain damage in the ring with a fresh killer like khamzat. if Diaz goes in mad af and swings for the fences he might rock him but the dude is a different breed of fighter he believes and not sure Diaz believes in himself anymore
Nate could win. Maybe Dana will give him a big payday 1 fight contract to fight the winner of Usman vs. Edwards 2
Love Nate! Hope he wins that fight
PUNCH DRUNK!
The Truth
blood in blood out
I love how ESPN bleeped all of Nate's dirty curse words since I'm in grade school and can't handle them even though I can handle watching grown men beat each other to a pulp and strangle each other into unconsciousness.
Great interview! Brett is brilliant, he managed to get the Stockton GOAT talking, managed long periods of silence & still strike a balance between presenting the UFC case & empathising with Diaz👏🏽
He is the realest fighter, that's why he's my GOAT. Win or lose he is the best
Mate the best hope he wins and gets that 20 mill to resign
They took advantage of you the whole time. Because your different from the rest of the fighters. All respects to you.  Shame on them no good pieces of 💩s. Took complete advantage of both of you. Sad mofos. For real
Nate has lost it :(
9:03 Nate: “what’s the word for it..th-th-they-they-control the-th-the scenario”  Me in bed losing it: “CONTROL. THE. NARRATIVE!!!!🤬🫠”
Dude has been hit in the head a few too many times
Diaz army 👊👊👊👊
I’m telling you what is it khamza is hungry of money and that’s why he asked this fight that’s it
absolutely humbled
absolutely humbled
I like Nate. Respect all the way. I wish he took this more serious so he would have more of a chance to win.
Diaz Army 💯
Team Diaz!
People here might be asking who's Fedor Emelianenko?
People here might be asking who's Fedor Emelianenko?
He has killed all his brain cells
If there was no rounds nate would win 99 percent of the time. Gsp coach said that too. Nates got a reach ,good standup. Cardio monster,good jiu jutsu and he is tough as nails.and never gets nervous under pressure
As sombody with a brother that don't get along very well with each other. I always noticed Nates love and respect for his brother is crazy. He never fails to mention that his big brother is his idol and mentor. This type of display of affection is rare nowadays even among familys everybody is all about self.
This feels like an interview with a man facing the death penalty…
did they record this video on the nokia phone?
LFG Nate
I wish I knew the number of times Nate said “IDGAF” lol
Can’t wait for the English version
Nate is like the grandpa who tells his grandsons stories
REFUSE TO BE LAME
Did he always sounded like Tyson?
This guy might consider retirement soon getting hit in the head for years might leave him bad over the years
Get paid, quit then enjoy life my man Diaz.
Even if he loses this man is still a winner 🏆
" got homeboys at home harder than any champion." Str8 yo. Always street. Always authentic. Gonna miss this fool when he gone man.
Nate is a legend! Rooting for the W for ya. Edit: man this was bittersweet good that he called the ufc on this nonsense bias.
Love this legend.
This is how a grown man sounds when he's been hit in the head so many times that he's been reduced to the mentality of a child.
I hope Nate and Tony both leave the ufc after this card and then fight each other in Nates organisation 🤌🏼
Let's go Nate! I know u can beat khamzat. I'm so ready for this fight. Nate's the real OG.
Nate finish this clovn
He's right, if you've done steroids, your whole legacy means nothing.
hall of fame please
What a bad journalist
I’ve never cared much for the Diaz bros, as people, but I’ve always enjoyed watching them battle. That being said, I’ve also never rooted for someone to win as much as I’m rooting for Nate.
Little toot  at 2:00  Haha Is he sober?
He looks a little nervous
I believe in you Nate !!!!  Team Diaz ✊
I believe in you Nate !!!!  Team Diaz ✊
I believe in you Nate !!!!  Team Diaz ✊
This guy can barely speak. Sad!
Nate is the draw, period
Guys! can you please spend a bit more effort and turn up the volume level like 6 more db's? The volume level is too low it is annoying!
He sounds like Tyson at times!
I have a feeling Nate is gonna fkn win, he has 0 pressure, he doesnt care. hes used to this. i just have a feeling.
Seems like these people who interview Diaz are intimidated. I just think that he's very honest about it all. The game has been not so true to the guy who brings his whole self to the octogon. Either way, a war is going to happen out of his corner. The organization goes for who will sell the most tickets and create lucrative odds. But this man is an old school, old soul, warrior. I hope he shocks the WORLD!!!!
I had tears from my eyes watching this interview. NATE everyone is with you the ufc will never be the same once you'll leave! I'll be always rooting for you!
Not too many individuals get over 1 million views in less than 24hrs. Nate Did.This man is the ppls champ no matter what.
Wishing The Best For You Nate!! Positive War Vibes!! I Want Your Hand Raised 💯
So he's saying the UFC forced this fight upon him???
This is what Nate does. He litteray fights the best
I "almost" feel bad for nate. Cause I truly believe Khamzat is going to kill him. Nate will be saved by the doctor though.
12:40 yeah thats where i stopped watching.
Who else would’ve rather seen tony vs Nate
"Great interview, I have to go now"🤣🤣🤣
I demand to know why UFC did not give me Nate vs Tony at 170
I don’t like Brett’s style such an emotional baiter.  These are real men see how Cormier and Rutten bond and interview.
Legend not matter how the fight goes! 🙌💪👊
Best thing to ever happen to UFC was Nate killing Dana’s prize egg Conor
he is a true legend..this match up is another time UFC is exposed ...this match up is a non sense, he's being disrespected!! hope he'll get the upset W just for him and to kill the UFC plans..hope him the best!!!
Celebrity boxing Nate vs Dana
Should have left in the swearing
nate diaz looks kinda like matt damon.
Running flying knee 2.0
I need the unedited explicit version
The man said "I REFUSE to be lame!" we never deserved Nate Diaz
Diaz Army all day! 💥💯👈
Let’s get this win!!! Diaz Army!!
Your the man Nate
Great quote there at 3:01, he said something really deep
As others have said in these comments. There is nothing the homie could do to make me like him less. Win or lose homie, you are the GOAT. 🙏🏽
Nate about to shock the world again!
Diaz you are not alone not only do you have your army but you have your fans that support you to the fullest!!!! Including me! I’ve watched you since TUF 5
I have to admit, I was having a really hard time understanding what Nate was talking about at first - I don't know if it is the nerves, or dislike of media, but there were several points where he was rambling about things unrelated to the question being asked.   Both him and Nick seem to be uncomfortable in the spotlight - which is ironic, given that they are both superstars with cross over appeal.   Even though I like Khamzat, I will be rooting for Nate in this fight. It would go down as the perfect end to a long and storied career... unfortunately, few athletes get that final sendoff on their terms .
Wow. Great interview
This was a good interview. NATE THE CHAMP!
The goats of today couldn't hang with past fighters
He looks the same 🤣 and mf calling him old and washed up 🙄 please this dude would fight death himself
1:25 that rude chuckle Brett did really frustrated me
Nate look like he took too many punches..his speech ain't right..he sound drunk...RETIRE MAN
Cte my boy! Choke kumshot out
Nate needs to retire and enjoy life
17:00 - 18:00 min mark is a really tough listen I hope cumshot shows Nate some mercy this is as bad as Muhammad Ali fight Larry Holmes
Nates the REAL FKN G.....REAL CHAMP GREAT MESSAGE!
Nates points about trying to be the champion or the goat 🐐 is just a waste of time is right. How many get Champ status and maybe even goat and then they get beat.  Look at Usman...  The real Champs fight the toughest guys for the longest time regardless of belt that give you an illusion of being the best.  Especially when somebody might come and beat you on any given day
30:54 he actually likes Dana deep down. His spanish even came out with an authentic smile.
Nate talks like Mike Tyson...does he have brain damage or something
I love u Nate you can see the agony in his face I pray he has a good night this weekend
Anyone else nervous about this fight? I'm getting Ali vs Holmes vibes nates not looking good at all..
Classic Diaz... went to interview, they start to ask ONE question.. and Diaz brother start talking from the childhood till the current pass time and end up the interview like that before they start thinking about second question
Smartest kid with down syndrome 🤣❤️
Let’s be real Nate could of been champion but he has respect for a lot of fighters and has that dog in him to fight anyone anytime. I really believe if they said to fight in a backyard he would do it. That’s why a lot of people respect him and he has an army behind him Saturday night’
I interviewed Chris “BEASTBOY” Barnett on my channel! We talk about his fight this weekend, check it out if you’d like!
In 10 years time this guys brain will be gone, gave his life to the sport and it’s owner treats him ( and all his fighters) like dogs. No right pay no health care. Shame on you dana white
5:40 "Fedor Milenko" shout out to ICP.
Beautiful interview
The G.O.A.T 🐐 him and Nick & both brothers should be inducted in the UFC awards Dana gave Cormier 💯
I really hope he wins
Nate got us all emotional, I cant believe this is the last RUN.. all the best Nate lose or win we will forever have much love & respect for you, till the wheels fall off❤🙏
its actually crazy how indifferent nate is to the technical win. for him getting the last laugh is winning lmfao. if he wins i say we start calling him the derailer, but i will say he is confusing when he talks about retiring or not lol "idk what ill do if ill leave or not but what i do know is im gonna be in the ufc"🤣👌🏼
18:30 this dude bruh… so legendary
If I was black,.. I feel like Nate Diaz is the kind of white guy that would make me cross the street to the other sidewalk for.
Did he really just say he beat Leon? He needs to stop smoking weed. He got completely outclassed and finally landed one punch in the 5th round. Yes you been in the UFC for 20 years but when was the last time you won? Lol
By far your still my favourite fighter nate. You’ve giving so much to the ufc and your still showing up to work you are a true warrior and will always have my respect. Let’s go beat this chump and earn that deserved rematch with Leon and bring home the title once more 💪
27:42 Nate negotiated signing on his entire team to the UFC. Absolutely brilliant, lol.
Nate could tap the mat on the opening second, and nobody would be pissed. We'd be stoked for his easy ticket to freedom.  That said, he's a "I'll be back with my shield or on it" motherfucker, but he would not deny us a fight, nor back out of one.  He's doin what he must one last time, to do what he wants for the rest of his life.  The McTrilogy will always be a sell. Even in 6‐7 years.
Nate can't lose this fight. He might not have his hand raised but he wins.
"If your Mr. Goat then make a goat...prove it"  🐐🥶
NATE SHOULD NOT FIGHT. HE IS OBVIOUSLY HAVING COGNITIVE TROUBLE. THIS FIGHT SHOULD BE ABANDONED.  DO NOT FIGHT NATE DIAZ.
He's gonna destroy khamzat because he's vegan.
Great interview, but why is the video quality so bad?
"This is just my half-time show, I'm just gettin started" - Nate Diaz is dope
He sounds like Mike Tyson
Any real fight fan despises mma coverage from the enemy ESPN that were so ignorant and hated on MMA for years, now there’s a marriage fook that Nate should slap them for that. Love Nate’s analogy of how fake azz Usmanbis a fake kettle betch. Never liked him or respected him GSP safe fighter
People say Tony has CTE but Nate seems way way worse imo  Could be all the bud he smokes though
We know Nate is going to win for sure! Khamzat is over rated.
😂😂😂😂 28:00 “fuhhhh there gonna sign all my friends and now I’m gonna have to fight here”
espn tell them pedos at disney to give u a better camera that can focus lol
Nate always looked as he’s dealing with depression to me. And it gets worse as time goes by. Same thing with Nick. Hope I’m wrong.
He deserves better. The amount of skill he has and the way he works a crowed he should instantly be a hall of famer!
Interviews should just do this.  Let them talk.
Nate is one of my favorites. He backs up his mouth
Cte working at it s finest
Is anybody gonna comment on Nates impression of Kamaru?
Díaz sounds drunk half the time.
Fckin therapist session....
33:17 😂
Nate has beat many UFC champions. He is one of the few still fighting legends of MMA.
Why would the ufc not want to make Diaz vs Ferguson or Luque????
Great interview indeed
LOVE YOU NATE, FROM FRANCE, I LOVE YOU ! but it's hard to understand everything you say, especially as a foreigner and when there's no subs ;-)
23:34 😂😂😂
Nate wanted this fight. He wanted a graceful exit from a warrior who could give him a proper retirement. The man's a warrior, we can't blame him. He obviously is not fit anymore. One last fight Nate, one last fight.
I can hear it. IM NOT SURPRISED MOTHA FUCKA
How is Nate still in the UFC. He loses all his fights.
I like khamzat but im with nate win lose or draw .
Hard not to love Nate, but he didn't make one single point this entire interview. He'd start down a path and 20 minutes later end nowhere.  The man has taken too much damage for his own good.
Check my track record, I always go for the Diaz boys. 💯% too real for the fakers 🚫🧢
Nate will always have most people's respect for the heart he piers out into every fight  Much respect & love!
Tough to watch  UFC needs to give this man his respect.
You have nothing to prove to no one ! Real fight fans know what’s going on .. never count out Nate ! -people’s champ !! All heart ❤️
Only two losses in the ufc which weren’t by decision and one of those a doctor stoppage. Fought anyone and has an incredible highlight reel. In a time where undefeated records are pushed to the front, as a fan, I’m always more excited for any Nate Diaz fight than any fight of Usman, Adesanya or Khabib. Regardless of what happens, he’s a legend.
Lets go Nate
💯
Absolutely oblivious. CTE much.
How can you not love this guy
Let’s go Nate
Nate is the realest.
Best interview ever
22:35
There is way he is mentally fit!!!!  His brain is scrambled
Wow! These 720p pixels look exactly like Nate Diaz
Hate ESPN, because it is part of the machine Nate talks about, but this was a very good interview. I have never met Nate Diaz, but I have a spiritual love for the guy. I dislike the way Dana White and the UFC promotion have used him and his brother. I pray Nate and Nick live the rest of their lives on their own accord and that their promotion thrives. I know I'll be supporting them. Hopefully we get 1 more " I ain't surprised motherfuckers"
Nate Diaz Army
What is he even saying
"....f*ck him. F*ck them. F*ck Everybody......" 🤣 I think most everyone knows Nate's broad appeal is he is the Realest of the real. Keep it that way Nate. Good luck this Saturday! Can't wait to see the fight
How they gonna censor the curse words lol
Has Nate always talked like this? Or is this brain damage. Has some good points but so hard to decipher his mumbling.
Your friends and family and fans are right here by your side. Finish your career with a win! Money's on you nate bring it home
Real Deal Nate Diaz
this guy have to stop to smoke
JOn jones isnt COming Back. il believe it when i see it. it seems all like a sherade
Great man great friend great fighter. Legende
Most articulate version of Nate Diaz ever
UFC champion means nowt.....I would rather watch Nate fight than a championship fight for a silly belt. I hope he does to khamzat what he done to MacGregor. He will be a winner at the end the fight no matter what happens.💪
Okamoto is my favorite MMA journalist, and Nate will submit the twisted lips cumshot chimea
nates right. its not about CHimiev , its about MAKING CHimieV. i  loved that statement
🙌🙌🙌🙌✊✊✊✊
Hope Nate beats him so then ufc finally gives him another world tittle shot if he stays and he dont he can shut them up on his way out !!
When you know your worth it’s not about money, it’s about principle.
I like Nate a lot .. but dangg if you say weed don’t have no side effects you wrong lol and then He gets punch in the head for a living thats like even worse to combine them both 😂
I like Nate ! But i think Chimaev will win.
I'm from Sweden and I hope Nate wins!! I will never forget ufc 196!! Won a 100 dollar bet that night..
Nathan ❤️you mofo loves you ..go after and beyond
Like to see Nate make him tap.
Diaz always gets cut I’d hate to see it
Let’s go Diaz 💪🔥❤️💋
"This is just my halftime show, I'm just getting started!" Tell em Nate
I'll always be in Nates Army.
but brother relax on the straight index finger under the nose....lol
NATE DIAZ YOU CRAZY GRAND MASTER MOFO...ALL YOUR HARD WORK, ALL THE EFFORT, EVERYTIME YOU WOKE UP AND COULD NOT BE F#^$ED GOING TO TRAINING BUT WENT ANYWAY AND WAS REWARDED WITH THAT FEELING, EVERY TEST YOU FACED LOST OR WON, THE SATISFACTION FROM PROVING THE DOUBTERS AND THE PLASTIC MARTIAL ARTIST WRONG AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE FROM STOCKTON MOFO AND THE FINAL REASON THAT AFTER PUTTING A GOOD STANCE ON Khamzat, SLAPPING HIM A COUPLE TIMES LETTING HIM KNOW ITS STOCKTON MOFO THE MAIN REASON YOU WILL SLEEP Khamzat IS BECAUSE WE ARE NOT SUPRISED MOTHER F#$%ERS
Nate represents every person who made their employer millions of dollars and never got the proper opportunities and recognition for his accomplishments.
Is he mentally disabled?
untouchable
Took me 3 days to watch but I like
Cant wait to see chimeav destroy this dude
Cant stand this dude's face
Nate’s done man leave him alone
Everyone who doubts nate needs to re-watch him beat Conor. Thats all you need to see
Imagine being such a big company and uploading a bad quality 720p video and it goes trending #1
By reading people comments, that Nates entire career, win or loose you are still the best. Nate has big wins against top fighters, but without going in obvious details,  its just hard to see him doing anything on Saturday. Hope it goes all 5 rounds.
His Usman impressions throughout kill me 😂😂 they’re spot on
Bro it's 2022, there's no way this video is only 720p...
Was this recorded using a toaster?
“If you’re Mr GOAT then make a GOAT…” …. Let’s go Nate!
At 8 or 9 mark he basically described usmans career
Sneak steroid'in 😂🤣
You and your brother are losers. Look at your record. Talk is cheap
He going to get beat to death
It's crazy how I seen ordinary ppl trying to pick a fight with this guy.
Nate Diaz Goated long time ago 😈 the UFC needs him .
Iam Russian woman from Europe. Iam far from sport! But even I see how true and mentally strong is Nate! Respect!💪🏻
Nate has an entire army behind him💪.
Nate lowkey wants that burns fight.
A mix of pride and sad disappointment. In a world of business he is still real and genuine.
16:35 xDDD
The most honourable warrior. He always wins, despite he loses a match. I will miss you if you stop fighting. Greetings from Hungary!
I'm the GOAT, besides my brother, lol. God luv ya NatO
The last 10 secs is how you know Nate is probably the realest UFC fighter. Next to my main homie Tony of course. Let's show this clown what it's like to fight a gangsta playa!!
Hes right look at McGregor he gone
“I am the Champion of the whole UFC “ Nate rolls to the beat of his own track
Ol' Nate is all over the place
So unique and Real.
Nate sounds defeated before the fight
Every time I see this Brett doing interview reminds me how Ariel is level above
I hope Nate never fights again after this:  his heart meant he took way too many shots during his career, and it's there to see. I hope he stops and prevent himself from further damage.
This sucks because to me its history repeating itself like what happened to the shamrock brothers
You fight oll top ten and you dont have the belt
He accent like a alien james franco from spring breakers movie,shiiiieeeet👀
Thumbnail looks like Matt Damon.
Diaz not trucks given haaa
I hope Nate Diaz upsets Khamzat now...
💯🤟🏾☝🏾🖤 Madd Respect to you Nate Diaz from Aotearoa (new zealand) and your Bro Nick Diaz MIGHTY LEGENDARY ARTIST' in their own RIGHT ...💯free420🤟🏾...
nate is over all this bull, im glad for him!
Effortless warrior mentality. Not influenced or affected by the surroundings, although not unaware of it either. This dude is some kind of savant stg
Nate's heart is bigger than whole Khamzat Chimaev body. This should be nice win against Chimaev.
muting the swearing... pathetic. names a legend. why would he do an interview with espn.
After listening to this Nate probably has one of the best business minds in the fight game, but people just don’t get it because it’s genuine
fk that i been sayin people are sleeping on nate...hype train might get derailed sat
Will be gutted to see him leave but been here since the start of his career and loved every fight
IF NATE WINS THIS GIVE HIM THE TITLE FIGHT!
12:40 Onwards. Pay attention.....
High on love, high on you.
His 2  teammates Gil and Jake are juice heads. So they are supposedly his boys but they are also the exact steroid users he's knocking. Kind if hypocritical.
Nate has a whole other vision in his head but he’s so right literally using Nate as a paper view so ufc can sell tickets and make nobody’s somebody’s khumzat is gonna get schooled
How can you not like Diaz brothers
It ain’t gonna be Stockholm ……Stockton motherfucker!
If Nate wins I’m naming my child after him … even if it’s a girl
👎
nice 720p
ryy3 3633
NDA!
Dude should retire, his speech has been wayyyy off for too long. Must be all the punches to the head :/
I refuse to be lame. What a legend
i want nothin but the best for him I feel like nate been thru so much bro really the definition of a warrior he got battles none of us understand even when we got our own all we can do is pray for the lad
Should put this interview in the HOF
Most introspective content we’ve ever seen from Nate Diaz. Things like this will be inspiration for badass motherfuckers 30 years from now. MMA needs Diaz(‘s) just as bad as it needs a McGregor.
why are they using a 2008 preset mode in the camera for this video?
This interview made me see Nate Diaz the Human Being. An honest interview by a man who really has nothing to lose and keeping it as real as possible.  Nate, you'll forever be the people's champion.
Love Man ❤❤❤🇹🇳🇵🇸
1.4M views on ESPNMMA, 750K Views on TheMacLife, and 180k Views on the UFC Channel. Thats more than 2M views in less than 24 Hours. Nate Diaz will carry this PPV to 1M Buys without the help of the UFC Promotion Machine. When Nate says this fight is brought to you by Real Fight INC, he ain't lying.
Nate just 10-7'd the entire organisation and fighters past and present
its almost like no one ever listen to nate...they would let him speak but no one has listened til now....i think at 20:00 he was looking for the word respect. He wants to fight people he respects in the fight game...
Nothing like a stoned Diaz interview
Lmao Nate put his hand on Dana's shoulder in the club and said "Do you feel in charge?"
He made Bret in this interview! That's what's up
Typical Nate interview: I'm better than everyone else because I've been in the UFC longer than them, even though my record is a pathetic 20-13, while others have beaten world class opponents in heaps.
Nate is going to win.
Lmao his impression of Usman 😂
For a moment i thought nate actually requested for this fight, don't let the ufc fool you guys. Go nate! They want you to make him, well, make him pay!
Dana they are not stars Diaz.  1.5 mil views.
Flog
I hope he wins . And come up with „I’m not surprised Mfs“
yuy y5y
5y 3634

khamzat is going to knock my man out first round unfortunately
Nate impersonating usman is hilarious
Dana did him dirty. Let's go Nate, hands up no matter what💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
What a guy... were all rooting for ya
Great interview until the end when I heard Steven A Smith's voice and was reminded that he exists
Nate got heart of steel man 🔥💪🏾
I didn't get what he deserves from UFC.
The Mike Tyson of UFC. I just worry if he smoked all his brain cells away to compete with a sober minded good fighter.
Wow different level of respect to Nate
Nates speech has deteriorated. Punch drunk? I know he has always had an impediment but is it just me or has he become hard to understand?
He's right there's a new "goat" every couple years
he almost too real for his own good
I’ll support nate and nick in whatever they do.
He should go out there and sit down the way his brother went out.  Before he's killed.
Nate's gonna ruin the UFC's plans.  Nates gonna shock the world again!!  GO NATE GO!!
I love how Nate doesn't even know his name 😂
He is done! Brain damaged from fighting + infinite amount of weed! He cant speak!

A real rocky nate diaz
One and only Nadia   Cc is crazy Nate about to fight it.
Nate you Rock Buddy will follow you always! My step son got me interested in to who you are you've been his hero like Batman or Superman and has followed your career since he was a kid your awesome GOOD LUCK NATE YOU GOT THIS!!
If fights had no rounds and no time limits Nate would be undefeated facts
Nate, I doubt you'll ever see this, But ill put it out there anyways!!  For 15 yrs you've always stood tall!! Never needed a UFC championship belt to be one of the biggest draws in the fight game! From Ultimate Fighter to UFC 279 you stayed loyal to family, Nick and Stockton Ca (209). Ready to bang it out anywhere anytime! Giving the bird to anyone that stood across from you and the UFC, So this weekend when you walk out on your last UFC fight that this is only the Half-Time show. And you will always be the real peoples champ!          🥊 "I'M NOT SURPRISED" 🥊
Wolf's come and go Legend's stay for ever !
Get him hard Nate 💪💯
He reminds me of Mike Tyson the way he talks
Nate Diaz got the Mike Tyson syndrome. They can’t speak coherently, and have very similar mannerisms lmao that last brain cell hanging on for dear life.
I hope Nate knocks this motha fuker out.
His impression of kamaru is gold lmfaooo actually sounded like him
“nigganou” 😂😭
Always enjoyed a Diaz fight. Nick or Nate. True gladiators. Ready to die out there in their field of battle. Warrior mindset. He still hasn’t been “finished” in the octagon. Hope he keeps it that way. Give them their roses! 💯
Fans should get big poster for him! After he will finish and say goodby
BOAT ⚓️
hi
What did he say after you’re welcome dubai?
Give em something to talk about Nate💯❤️
only time i seen the ufc trending on youtube ngl
Ive never seen such a great interview. Nate keeps 100% real. Btw I have never seen 13,000 plus comments on a video from espn or ufc. Nate Diaz is a living legend and an icon of combat sport.
“I’ll fight all them in 5 seconds… with all due respect” 🤣🤣
How about an uncensored version you dorks
Dude is checked tf out
wheres the uncensored version?
I tell you right now if ufc ever change the rules and made it a 6 round fight nate will be the one to win it every time cause he's that long distance fighter that will take you into deep waters and drown you ,,just look at his resume when he gets to the 5th round he brakes his opponents so bad you see it in there faces ..they panic and hoping fight be over soon ..nate is no joke ,he the truth and the best in the game .. I got nate winning this next fight coming up sep 10 ,2022
Mentally he's already on the way out. I predict a poor performance just like his older Brother a few months ago.
Diaz bros are depressed dudes man. Self medicating for years. On top of it all Nate knows the end is near
I love Nate but this the most Autistic mma interview I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
I wish he coulda held out for Conor.
Great interview! I hope he gets that knockout cuz we all know he could of done it to Edward's but it's all business.
Everybody wants to be the best.. good luck hahaha
Dammit nate stop the goddamm thing men......
209 motherfuckers
What’s funny is Nate is on the money. He has fought top 10 top 5 guys his whole career. He’s correct guys win the belts and become puppets. Not everyone can be a GSP! Even Anderson Silva was slept as a champ. Nate is correct.
6th time watching this, Nate is a beast. I just hope if he rocks Khamzat like he did edwards he goes straight for a guillotine and finishes him
Best line ever. You do Roids and I’ll smoke a joint. Unreal
I’m not surprised muthafukers!!! “Nate Diaz”
If you mr GOAT then make a GOAT is a cold line ❄️
shoutout to ESPN for airing this, can't be forgotten UFC is in an exclusive broadcast deal with ESPN and they're willing to show Nate's unedited opinions against their partner.
Brett handled this so perfectly. Respect
I loved how he squashed the legacy of Jon jonnes in second 😂😂....
THE BEST!!
Subtitles please
Nate is to funny, guy needs to avoid the weed
if he still has the fire, he can join eagle fc after this
I think the last comment he just found his “mindset”!   “I refuse to be lame!” - Nate Diaz
Fire your audio guy. How is the last Nate Diaz interview in the UFC half the volume of the commercials?
Diaz army for life one love
Nate has always been a Babyface guy. He legit looks like a grizzled man right now
27:14
There will never be another fighter like nate diaz he's a legend
American fake gangster
I'd much prefer nate vs tony. Would be a much more competitive fight. I see why nate is frustrated. The ufc is using him to build up khamzat, because right now nate is the main draw under contract
1.4 Million views in one day. Fukn insane. Nate by submission DONT BE SURPRISED MTHFKRS 🤣😂
It should of been Dustin Poirier vs Nate Diaz
Nate is the realest mf in the game
This dude is punch drunk ufc needs to invest in fighter healthcare fr
I'd love to day nate win this but when we saw what masvidal did to him, I don't hold much hope. This guys a legend
If those guys are G.O,A.T.S. Nate is a WOLF P.S. Not Khamzat
Niganu
"It dont feel right  if it is not happening"
Hands down one of the realest! I hope he beats the breaks off chimaev and rides off into the sunset flipping the bird
720p video in 2022 ...$50 billion company btw
“If you’re Mr Goat then make a goat.” He said a lot with that ❗️
26:46 😂
Starting at 13.42 it sounds like nate said he signed another contract with the ufc and pauses after he says it.
It's interesting this has twice as many views as the Khamzat interview despite being released a day later.
Never seen him speak this much
I hope he uses all this anger towards all the haters n Dana etc to f Khamzats world up. We love you Nate. Watching you choke Conor out was still the best thing I’ve ever seen.
Tat interview as real as it gets ... Everytime he talks about he didn't forget to mention his brother Nick Diaz,the real OG in tis game, 💯
Nate Diaz. A real guy in a phony world. He is not stupid as people may think. Maybe a little too hard. But he is really a funny guy taking care of his team and family. He will do great things still after UFC. Nate > UFC
209
EVER SEE A MAN CRY FOR 30+ MINUTES?
2nd round triangle choke Diaz wins
Love Nate.
Hahahahahahahahaha Nate doesn’t even know his name hahahaha….  God, you have to love this guy
I love watching nate fight
There's no denying the Diaz Brothers are tough as nails. They clearly have autism as well if you listen to them speak for more than 5 minutes.
I’ll ride with the Diaz Brothers till the wheels fall off! I’m from LA but this weekend I’m rooting for Stockton!
The allure of being authentic is what makes us being enamored by him 💯
Nate said there's fan lovers and fan haters. Son, trust me, you have more fan lovers than you know. We're behind the true warrior! 👍Your fans champion 🏆
es[na mma hittin 720p in 2022! sheeeesh!
REPRESENT!!! RESPECT!!! Congrats Champ!!!!
Nate the goat… Nate will win
This doesn't feel right.
12:40
Let’s go 209! Stockton stand up ❤
Im all for having confidence in yourself but when he says some of the things he's saying it almost comes off like a mental health issue. I'm stupid I don't know much about that subject at all that's just the vibe I get. I pray Nate wins. Though
He is the Ultimate Fighter.
Nate has a way of making points without having the vocabulary to. Yet I still know exactly what he means…
He’s right the word goat is throw around too easily. None of these goat have the pedigree and resume that Nate has and non of them have left a mark on the sport like Nate has.
Nate via flying gogoplata in the 5th.!
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.      !..
Win, lose or draw. Can't ever say this man ain't 100. Best of luck my friend.
Love watching him fight, they don’t get any tougher or more durable. I saw an interview back when he was still pretty new recently, sucks to hear how clear his speech was then to now. Him and his brother always laid it on the line. I hope the damage he’s taken over the years to entertain us the fans doesn’t destroy his quality of life.  Much respect, he deserves it.
Man what's up with the quality
This is almost literally Nick.  Nate and Nick are exactly alike.  We are blessed with 2 of these savants.
Nothing but respect for Nate Diaz !
I think him taking a blatant dive stupid early in the fight then giving the finger to Dana would be more epic than an upset.
25:47 Another example it's  F     I        X            E                D  For.... N    A    T    E
How many dabs did Nate do before the interview?
I love how Brad just lets Nate ramble...
Nate! ✊🏼
The Diaz brothers just have a different mind set It’s literal war, a fight to the death In Nate’s mind he’s killed Leon in the real world. Nate on the other hand is very very difficult to kill.
Ufc did Nate so dirty  Prior to Conor they had him on a 20k show/20k win contract which was laughable and insulting  When he beat Conor Dana went on for months about how Nate was 521 pounds bigger than Conor the night of the fight blah blah Then he says Nate only wanted to fight francis or Izzy but clearly as he mentions here he was down for Ferguson Dustin chandler Then for his final fight they give the worst possible stylistic matchup and to add insult to injury put Ferguson on the same card anyways
♥️♥️♥️ All day
Every fight fan gotta love Nate!  If every fighter had a mindset like him, every fight would sell out,... everybody loves a real battle! 💯 Nate delivers! Street mentality, he is the winner of most of the fights he lost, cause in the street, you gotta be winning at the end to be the winner... if I am beating a guy the 1st 30 seconds, then he takes me down and starts bashing my face in, people pull him off, nobody says I won because I hade 80% more strikes landed... so if the bell saves a fighter from what seems like a certain loss, Nate sees that guy that got saved by the bell as the loser, no matter what happened in the other rounds.
Love him forever!!
I can’t stand this interviewer. Big dork
Nate should just walk out of the arena after the bell 🔔 just to get out of his contract and 🖕🏽🖕🏽 UFC  😂🤣😂
I'm not 100% sure Nate's head in this fight. He just wants to get it over with because he wants out of the UFC. If this was 2015 or 2016 Nate when he called out Conor this would be a much more intriguing matchup.
One of sickest interviews ever nate diaz such a legend! “Bunch of nerds” 😂
I think hamza is ganna get ko by Nate
Diaz vs Ferguson could have easily been the co-main.  Khamzat vs Covington or Burns 2.  Diaz is right,  this is unnecessary, unappreciative and disrespectful
That's kamaru impression was gold "I'm the man"
Man that was a hard watch
He is so punch drunk out of his mind it’s pretty sad to watch. Think of Muhammad ali in his older years i wish the best for him would never want to see him that out of whack
Lesgoo Nate!!!!
Wish he wins and says yet again . ‘I am not surprised mf’
The GOAT
Nate has every reason for the way he’s feeling you can they’ll he’s very betrayed and unimpressed with the ufc for this one , he clearly Just wants out at this point I feel bad for a man that entertains me 15 years in a row
Nate didn’t have to be the champ. He’s everyone’s champ already.  Mad respect.
Just rewatched the Masvidal fight. I thought Nate got destroyed the first time I watched it. This time I realized Nate was gaining on him, and I could absolutely see him winning that fight. Masvidal looked a bit concerned about what was going to happen if the thing kept going.
Nate is out of it
Lets go Nate 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The man. Best to ever do it
Nate looks huge compared to recent fights
This guy's a f****** idiot he barely even speak f****** English I can't wait to see the most overrated fighter just get f****** destroyed garbage
Lol Who's Febor Melinko?
Love Nate man, he is the realest dude out there.
How sick would it be for Nate to whoop his azz
9:49 LMAO im dead
Why make Nate do these tho you know he doesn't want to be there
Why did Nate stay in UFC so many yrs for them?? There had to be some good that came out of it for Nate
20:00 Nate vs Ngannou, make it happen Dana :-0  Seriously though, I need to see Nate vs Ferg. No idea who wins that one
This is what i call the interview
I got money on Khamzat, but I'm rooting for Nate. That would be so sweet to see him shock the world with a KO
"I refuse to be lame". Such a Nate thing to say😂
Nick Diaz Army, love how Nate says great interview Brett, but I gotta go
Tren cough just won't stop. Everybody in this game is on steroids
Best interview ever! Its too bad we won't be able to hear anything.
“Nobody fought top ten guys in the last fifteen years but me!” lol lol love Nate
I feel so bad for this man. He has so much brain damage, it’s so visible.
His mentality is one of a kind, but man his speach and constant loss of his train of thought worries me. He has taken some permanent damage  no question all in the name of entertaining us. Doesnt even care about belts etc. Definitely a true fighter's fighter
I got The Legend Nate Diaz
I can never understand what he's saying lol
He going to try and ground nd pound all day watch out for Chimave
lmao hearing him say "you shoulda worked on a computer somewhere you nerd" as I'm watching this on a computer at work
Peoples Champ.
Nobody has more heart than this guy!!! Cant wait for another great battle!!!
The people’s champ never loses. He knows this. It also happens to be true.
I feel for Nate. He looks depressed. I think he's thinking legacy and realized that he's most likely going to be overlooked. He stated he's the best fighter there.  Not necessarily the best to ever do it (skill wise) but being the realest resemblance to the true definition of a fighter. Also looks like he doesn't believe he's going to win and is thinking of the negative outcomes of a loss as well as how the UFC did him dirty at the end of his legendary career
Real warrior. A lot of people of this era can learn a lot from Nate. Real G
Dang man look at all the Scar Tissue around Nate Dawgs eyes n forehead
This is what makes the Diaz brothers so dangerous, they wear their heart on their sleeve. For them everything is personal!
In 6 months I see Nate sitting on a porch in Compton with his homies drinking a 40 discussing what liquor store to rob😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I wish he would have dropped his cash app at the end.
"I'd rather NOT"  "You should've worked somewhere on a computer somewhere you nerd"  Nate Diaz. What a legend.
I was waiting for him to mention that his brother got suspended  for a currently unbanned substance for longer than most fighters ufc careers
I wont be surprised motherfuckers
Nate ain’t done. We will see him somewhere doing something great.  Thank you Nate.
Lets go Nate! Prove them all wrong!
Good Luck Nate! Great interviewer! Lets Nate speak without interrupting every second!
It’s like watching 3 interviews at once.  You have to try to figure out what he is literally saying because of the speech impediment and the pleeps. And what he was going to say if he didn’t lose his train of thought, and what he’s editing himself not to say. Then he crowns himself the goat of interviewers on his was out!  Perfection.  This dude definitely thinks in pictures not words.
The real bmf for a long time win or lose
When I watch Khamzat interview, I don't understand his english. But when I watch Nate, his english is good. But I hardly understand his accent or maybe his high asf all the time🤣 Anyways. I hope you win the fight Nate! My brain said Khamzat but my Heart said Nate. I hope you don't cut your face easy, till the end. Goodluck!🇵🇭
yea khamzat doing that whole "lets see who's the real gangster" bit was cringe asf. And I feel like the UFC fed him that line to say, since khamzat respects nate so much.
fkn okimotto dork. NDA 💯
Nate is a true legion
how can you not love nate??? 💪🏾 true OG in the game
this guy talks a lot of stuff about the current champs being this and that but he wouldnt beat any of them.
That loss to Masvidol was a bad look. That shouldn't have happened.
Is he throwing the N bomb ? 😮😮😮😮
Him and his brother are truly the greatest of all time. Only 2 that never dodged anyone, always fought the best and was always entertaining AF! I’ve paid for fights cause the Diaz brothers! Way to stay true to yourselves..
Another Diaz vs Mcgregor would be something
You do steroids, I smoke weed idgaf let's get in there & squab -Nate Diaz-
Best Nate interview of all time! reminds me of Mike Tyson lowkey
Legend. Both brothers. Thank you for all you have done for MMA💕
I'm a huge Nate Diaz fan, but I think he is showing signs of being "punch drunk". Too many wars. That said, I hope he wins Saturday.
Nate Diaz knows a little something about how the UFC works.
The realest mf out there.
nate never lost he just runs out of rounds
Why is the video quality look like it’s from 2010😂😂
720p? From ESPN? for Nate Diaz? in 2022?
Dope boy fresh💯‼️🥊🥋🥷🏼
how sounds similar to mike tyson
All jokes aside Nate is absolutely incoherent
Nate Diaz is the best friend we all wish we had. Nick also. Everyone thinks they have or has had a good friend. They set the bar. Do the right thing, not say. Just do.
Mad respect for one of the OG’s in this game. 💪🏻💪🏻
Dana saying he loves Nate is the most hypocrital s*** ever
RESEARCH the TRUE FLAT EARTH TOPIC NOW!!
Given Nate is well past his prime, lost his last 2, lost 4 of his last 6 and is now ranked 20th. Not right to end his career with an undefeated up and comer ranked 3rd after all he’s done for the sport and all the $ he’s made for the ufc it is f*** up...
Nate Diaz army mfs let’s go baby
Nate is what Masvidal wishes he could be. 100% raw real savage
So many people can relate. Gangster or not, so many people "get it" from all walks of life. That's why these Diaz bros will always have more love win OR lose than anyone else in the game. Its just real. Find someone else famous that can  do that! Money is only one thing we worry about, if you check money off yer problem list, the list doesn't get smaller.
Luv the Diaz Brothers  but I get tweaker vibes! Sad to see his interviews over his career  WAY TOO MANY HEAD SHOTS
I have so much respect for Nate 💪🏻
Dana really screwed Nate over
Realist most honest interview I've ever seen, hands down
Team DIAZ all the way 💪 💯✊️😤
I love Nate but he is delusional.
Way to many blows to the face bro. Get a nice comfy couch for when you start drooling
Hate it or love it, Respect the Diaz bros. They aren't scared, and when they win they're not surprised MF's
Diaz brothers all day nothing but respect. I hope Nate wins. I’ll be rooting for him.
Nate deserves RESPECT! Win lose or draw he always shows up to fight he has a cast iron chin! I ALWAYS tune in when Nate is fighting, Nick is the same way, these 2 are my favorite fighters to watch. They are real, they are legit OG and they fear nobody! I’ll never forget after Nick lost to GSP and he told him in post fight press conference you hit like a B!tch, if you agree to fight me again I think I’ll beat you lol. I love GSP he’s one of my All time favorite fighters but that was hilarious lol
Nate your a beast mate big respect go win this
Nate gonna surprise your mofo’s come Saturday!
IM EXCITED FO THE FIGHT!!> Go Nate Brother. everybody wants to see you shake up the World Again for Us Fans!!!!

Nothing but a n word lover!!!
Lmmfao he said where's your guy usman.. Ummm RASHAD EVANS HOF LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMP TUF 2 WINNER BETTER RESUME THAN YOUR BRO. N USMAN HAS A BROTHER THAT JUST WON TUF STFU, TOOK 2 MANY PUNCHES
okay but why is the video quality so horrendous
ufc cant afford 1080p?
Been with you since day one, I'll be here for you and your team till the end of time. Let's go Stockton!
Nate thinks to fast.... Anyway all my life's failures will feel alittle better if Nate wins!!! Cool.
Love this interview, but c'mon ESPN, you can't afford 1080p cameras?
Nate diazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
“…I’d go home with my homeboys and be like, “y’all saw how I did that? That’s how you do that.””   STOCKTON MOTHERFUCKER, STOCKTON!
The best part of all this is, money didn’t change him!
Man. This hard to watch.
Best Interview of Nate Diaz !! Thank you ESPN for being great at interviewing him !! Btw I’m rooting for Nate and I know he’s gonna win :) shock the world !! 209 !!
Extra stoned?
did he always talk like this?
Love this kid, will always be one of my favorite fighters. My number 1 is his brother, nate was the baddest mother f*cker in the game,
Nate is gonna have some gnarly punch drunk symptoms in the coming years until he dies.. yikes 😱
You Welcome Dubai 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆..how can you not Love nate diaz
Did they were smoking??
When it’s “all you know” it’s cause you think that’s all you’re purposed for. But there’s more for you Nate. When you teach what you know, you’ll compound the return of that feeling — knowing you’re exactly where you’re suppose to be doing what you’re suppose to being doin. except on another level, full of new challenges and excitement.  Vs plateauing and feeling like he done it all.
This might be one of Nate’s best interviews he’s ever had. You can sense that he is being his true authentic self, but being his last fight (possibly in the ufc) this has a different feeling to it. Nate has had a great career up to this point and hopefully an even better one no matter what happens next.
I like how Bret always gives him a free therapy session. 😂😂😂
Nate shouldn't leave, we all know its one and done if he tries the boxing route
This guy is going to have a movie done on his life one day. No doubt about it. Who would play Nate Diaz well?
I love nate, but he's gonna get rocked.
The best UFC fighter in my opinion!!! Now go Shock the world Nate!!
"you shoulda worked on a computer somewhere ya nerd" LMAO ABSOLUTE GOLD
Respect Nate!!!
Pure knowledge being dropped from one of the OG's in the game. wow Nate's best interview. Nate's the goat
I'm betting large nate do your thing brother 💪
So much respect for Nate. This guy is a true UFC legend and someone who has been around since I first starting watching the sport. It’s also nice to see the real Nate and learn a bit more about how he truly feels. That being said, I do feel like he’s not looking forward to this fight and kind of feels set up to take a beating. I just hope he puts up a good fight and retires with his health and a nice bank balance.
This my half time … Nate Diaz
Why is Nate being blooped out.. we love him for him stop censoring his language
“ I refuse to be lame” - Nate Diaz  WWNDD
Drugs and brain damage. Stay in school kids
He really needs to stop smokin before interviews. His rambling makes me not even wanna watch after only 5 min.
Nick Diaz brought me to MMA, Nate Diaz kept me watching this incredible sport.
Nate vs Dan hooker would hav been way better 2 brawlers that always take on the toughest guys
I wish him the best in health I hope he’s ok when he gets older, this guy has nothing left but fighting…UFC has really screwed him around….
It’s weird not seeing him covered in blood.
Why do I like Nate? This quote right here... *Referencing contract negotiations* "You want me? Then all my guys are coming, you're signing ALL 10 of my guys" - *Nate Diaz*  That loyalty, Nate for all his faults is an authentic guy. What you see, is what he is and that makes him easy to believe in especially when he's proven time and again he has the skills and the willpower to win against anyone.
LFG!!!!!!!!! Nate shocks the world. Again.
“If you’re Mr. GOAT, then make a GOAT…”  - Nate Diaz ‘22
Latino fighters in the ufc, and in boxing are always about heart and pride and the Diaz brothers aren’t an exception! 🥊 ❤
He’s been stepped on for too long. I hope he wins by KO 1st round.
Hi brother we feel for you But I know that you can do it come on don't let us down be the champion that you are bro we love you man
Interviewer started quite aggressive lol
This dude has some cte
1 genuine matter of fact human being
Does the UFC have fighters checked for TBI? Probably not.
Shoutout to Fedor !!!
Nate looks sad here man.. I think deep down he’s sad he’s gonna have to give it up soon. Dude just wants to fight forever. Body can’t do it forever though. Wish him the best.
Nate you are one of the best fighters in the UFC but for me you are the Icon of what a fighter represent. Good luck 👍 the Hall of Fame is waiting foe you 💪🏼💪🏼
Although it’s unlikely, nobody would be surprised if Nate destroys yet another hyped fighter and this time just walks off 😂😂😂
30:21 😂
Lets go Nate!!!, REPRESENT bro!!
“I refuse to be lame” what a legend
NATE ALL DAY GIVE HIM THE STOCKTON SLAP
He doesn’t look healthy 😢😢😢 he looks tired stressed depressed 😢
His Kumaru impressions are low key kinda good 😂
I watched 5 mins of this..and Nate is stressed the f out.. but that's fight week.. thats the feeling of going to war..I hope Nate wins..
He’s washed
Represent
Dudes a winner no matter what.
Nate is the man he is the realist fighter in the UFC I Love that he said I refuse to be lame that him in a nutshell
Love watching the Diaz brothers fight, always fun and entertaining. But neither should ever do interviews...
Years from now.   People are going to know Nate Diaz as he knows BJ Penn.  Nate fans say who is BJ Penn?
Guy is 37 & uses his face to block. Guy is delusional. Was never a top 5 guy. Forgets Leon & Jorge beat the puss out of him
I don’t think Chimaev thinks little about Nate. He actually spoke very highly of him, but I don’t think Chimaev thinks it will be one sided at all.  I also agree with his Jon Jones comment.
Bro even ends his own interview I love this man
Nate’s the Boss
i need subtitles
He def shooting up between the toes
Why does he look so miserable on the thumbnail?🤷🏽‍♂️😂
You've already won Nate, you are the peoples champion. There isn't anyone like you or Nick. Amazing interview. True warrior, the real deal! Your wife is so lucky, I wish I had a man like you to have my babies!!!
"If you're Mr. Goat, make a Goat"  Instant Classic😅
This man has a true winning mentality, win or lose he puts it all on the line and because of that he’s a winner.
Big fan of Nate! Wish him the best. This interview had me hanging on every… uhh…whats the word? You know what im sayin.
He kinda has a similar cadence when speaking to Mike Tyson
Stoppage by cuts most likely.
Diaz have The classic face of a problem Boy... His face remember me at Bullier of The school.
We need better interviewers.  This dude is horrible
Always loved him. Win or lose bro got heart.
Looks like this interview got to him
Ima follow the Diaz Brothers for life Dana messed up 💯
Love Nate!!! Hope he shocks the world
True champ right there
Respect
Nate Diaz and Mike Tyson are the same person. Love it. Please "smesh" abe lincoln
Brett is so good at his job.
He is the realest fighter period
I feel bad for him
the best ufc interview ever !
Nate will always be a legend and he's a dog in that case not scared of anyone he's got a lot of scar tissue that opens up right away but u can tell all  the  hits he's took is adding up i just hope n pray he wins and takes no damage🙏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇺🇸🇲🇽
Nate you are one of the best and if there it's a way to bet on you I will do it Would be good if you share your way of acting with Canelo so can learn something good of being real and honest
Isn’t this high key the same exact interview when Nick was go’n off about why he “couldn’t understand” why he wasn’t fighting Kamaru Usman for the Championship, instead he was fighting Lawler, whome he already beaten?
Hopefully Nate doesn't lose to cuts, like with Masvidal.
Billion dollar company films in 720 p
Let's go NATE!!!!!! I'm rooting for you, make history!!!
Early in the fight before they are sweaty he should pull guard  then break his arm just like the old days. His jujitsu is world class. With all Nate's scarring he'll be opened up quick. Nate has what it takes only hope he starts out fast .
Safe to say nate hates usman 😂
This guy has brain damge.  He needs to stop fighting.
It's funny how nate and khamzat talk , I don't understand everything they say some words just goes somewhere else ...I thought nate was crying first 😢ha 🤣 😂 🤔
The MMA industry is based on the corporate exploitation of the raw drive and authentic courage of individual fighters, nearly to the point of commodification. Fighters have woken up to see they're being sold out and sold short. Fighters should unionize. Fertitta's made billions selling  them to Endeavor. What do you expect from junior mafia D'ump loving management. I still watch free fights because there is nothing like it and I appreciate the individual artists and competition. But I hate the business. And fighters do too.
Pay this man his worth!
The DIAZ brother's will never lose their popularity! Cali baby all day. 😎👊🏽👊🏽
How’s Nate disrespecting Leon when Leon was literally beatin’ tf outta him ‘till that slap?
I love to watch him fight! But my lord that dude’s brain is all over the place. Maybe he shouldn’t be fighting!
The interview was actually elite
My speakers keep cutting out
Nate is always fun to watch. Never count him out!
He is drunk and don’t have control over his mind  Please stop smoking
I just want him to win
Nate looks so uncomfortable with how comfortable the interviewer is 😂.
Was this filmed with a I phone 4?
I have a bad feeling
Nate to me is like the Mike Tyson of MMA and UFC + he's a master at just boxing too🥊
Let go Nate 🙏🏼
This fight will be garbage. UFC sometimes is awful.
Got so much respect for Nate but my god he can’t afford to take another beating or another war. You can tell his brain is mush from all the wars
This interview needs to be protected in the library of congress and studied by scholars for centuries to unlock the deep meanings within. Dayum!!
He got demons inside of him..
Nate is talking about fighting like hes fought for years top 10 top 5 and never lost 😂 leon edwards thing again he got smoked for 24 mins and couldnt finish 😂 this guy is as delusional as ever usman fought everybody and will continue to do so he lost he took it like a champ i dont get why everyone is saying this is great hes talking absolute nonsense and if khamzat can stay focused and not get wild dog fight like the burns one he smokes diaz no question inshallah
Nate has been punched in the head too many times he’s gonna get crushed
Dude is drunk 24/7 and does not even need to drink
Nate all the way
what did say?
Poetic, eloquent and concise. You are a wordsmith of the highest order
No dislikes 👎 you gotta love Nate Diaz
Win lose or draw its nick diaz army moth3rfuck3r$
Manz conjured Robert DeNiro vibes and turned the interview into a warning to the world. He’s a real gangsta but the torch will be passed to the next one so respect. khamzet to win💪🏼 respect Nate
I can stand behind about 70% of what he says, the other 30% just makes him sound delusional. Can anyone honestly tell me what Nate wants? Volk Is a top 5 pound for pound fighter all time in the UFC.
Nate said a whole lot of nothing
This punk is scared he ducked Khabib for years but this time he got caught in the net and he scared.
been lovin diaz brothers since jump street.
The interview ends when Nate says it does.
I feel sorry for Nate in this interview. He’s given everything to the UFC, and everyone was saying “oh Nate wanted this fight”.. we’ve just heard from his own mouth, he didn’t want this fight and still doesn’t, but he’s a true G so took the fight anyway. I feel like Khamzat will win, in a nasty way. But I’m praying Nate pulls off the biggest shock ever, then flips Dana off saying “F*CK YOU” 🖕🏽👊🏽😎
Win or lose nate is a legend !
I want just one of Nate`s doobies man!
Diaz bros vs Tate bros! 😃
It makes sense what he’s talking about how are you gonna build some one else with Nate Diaz last fight and not pay him really good money for this fight and make everyone else business and not give him what he wanted to go out as fighting maybe some one in the top 5
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brooo “the only reason you fight is cuz of me” gave me chills
I hope Nate wins!
NICK DIAZ ARMY STILL. TRAIN BY DAY JRE BY NIGHT ALLLL DAY
LETS GO NATEEEE !!!!!
Is he not doing the usual pre-fight presser?
Nate Diaz vs Tony furgeson and Khamzat Khizarovich Girikhanov vs Colby Covington  am i crazy ar is this THE best FIGHTCARD with more more money for the fighter and the UFC
What a poor interviewer.   Such bland and boring questions
That Usman impression 😂
Prove them mfers wrong again! Kill ‘‘em Diaz!
I almost felt like I was watching a Tyson interview. Nate's a natural born brawler.
You got our backs Bro, go do your thing, whatever happens you our champion Ese!!
Diaz brothers are LEGENDS!!! Nick Diaz is the original G! Alwayz!💯
Thats my boy. Bring it Nate!
I love nate huge fan of diaz bros,but man he's got huge victim mentality
I really hope he comes out and shocks everyone
He truly is the realest warrior and the realest champion. Not tip toeing around his belt and wanting to fight the best. Plus if fights went 10 rounds he may never have lost a fight. And a real fight has no time limit. I believe in Nate, He’s going to win!
Would be a dream seeing Nate finishing this Talkaev.
This interview really showed us Nates human side, man really feels its coming to an end and he’s pouring it all out before he leaves.
Nate Diaz the Arturo Gatti of MMA 🙌🏾  Win,lose or draw nothing but love and respect!
starting to sound like mike tyson
Nate is the dude
I pray that Nate Diaz wins this fight.
This was a great interview!!!!
💯 agreed  The current UFC champion are not real champions!!!  I would Have to say Isreal Adesanya is a real champion tho, bcoz he fought top UFC fighters since day one. And became a UFC champion In a short time. Like Daaaaaam 💯❤🔥. You all heart Nate ❤ you bro. You are a champion thx for the memories homie🍻
He's so coherent
barely understand anything he's on about. he articulates himself like a retard
Ufc are the biggest douche bags ever for doin nate like this
Worst possible interview for Nate. This guy has zero social calibration he's just trying to get his questions heard because he thinks they're so insightful.
This just goes to show you how shady Dana White and the UFC is. Nate Diaz has been there forever but they want to throw him to the wolf. It's all right he'll fight him, but odds are stacked against him like the McGregor fight. Maybe more so this fight. I actually hope he wins
Funny how many similarities Nate and Tony Ferguson have, both 155ers towards the end of their careers now fighting at 170 being setup against younger guys. Both have that "I'm an uncrowned champ" mentality, both have crazy cardio, iron chins, legit jiu-jitsu, volume pressure fighters. I'd like to see Tony join the Diaz bros squad lol
God I love this man!
Kamru usman imitation hahahaha
I used to hate Nate just because Conor is my my favorite fighter and I was kinda new to the UFC cause I didn’t know the history behind him I just thought he was a dude talking. But I like Nate. As a person and a fighter I feel like no matter who you are. Just a random person he would sit down and just give you knowledge instead of avoiding you. He seems wise and he deserves more then what the UFC has given him. they have used him for a punching bag and just to give fighters a platform. He deserves the platform now. I hope he raises his hand in victory Saturday night.
He doesnt do fancy speeches but he’s a warrior he sells ppv’s because he’s a warrior win or lose he’s one of the most exciting fighters out there. He brings more money than khamzat easy
man this interview make me feel for Nate! he really open up from the bottom his heart. real truth!
Props to Okamoto. It is TOUGH to interview Nate Diaz. He doesn’t give you much. He’s hard to understand. He can’t articulate himself all that well. And gawd forbid he doesn’t like you…because he won’t even TRY to be understood or answer your stupid questions. 😂 Hats off to Brett.
love to see Diaz win as a last F U to Ufc and Dana white ..but i dont see it happen
i really dislike brett
I want this dude to win.
How stoned omegalul
I think Nate smoked all the weed before this interview!!!!!
Lol calls him Brad  and says he has to go 😂😂
He’s drunk he don’t even now what he’s saying
Why does NATE HATE USMAN SO MUCH?
Let’s surprise the world again NATE !! NDA💯💯💯
Best fighter in the UFC? Not even close Nate or Nick. Chimaev will smoke him. I don't dislike Nate but I'm routing for Chimaev.
nick diaz army
Diaz has lost 3 out of his last 4 fights. Very annoying that the interviewer never questioned Nates delusion!
I felt he was very emotional this time..I'll put $500 on you buddy!!
He's right about Khamzaht. The whole UFC should take notice khamzat don't have no respect. Nate is one of the OGs of The UFC this clown should be talking with respect. Not talking about sh** that he can't even pronounce.
Every fighter thinks they are the BEST !! From Nate to Usman to Leon..If You don't think that you won't get far thinking otherwise.  Nate definitely lost alot but he did so with the heart of an absolute lion and I feel like he didn't give up..I think overall he lost his love of the ufc and passion for fighting bc off ufc.  I hope he shocks everybody like Leon did Usman. IT'D BE SO FUNNY TO FUK UP UFC'S PLANS BY NATE PULLING OFF A HAIL MARY.
Bruh he clearly have CTE problems .......
Nate’s response to Jon Jones being the goat is so true 23:35
I like his talk about legends.  He mixed up ninja and shogun.   I hope Nate has a great performance.  I like both guys but a fan of nate by association when I heard nicks brither fights
There will never be another Nate Diaz
I like Khamzat but Nate has been my boy from the very beginning and I would love to see him ruin the UFC plans again
F$&*in gettem Nate!!!
Ima Diaz Head All Day Str8 TF Up🖤🔐
Nate , brother, go in and Kick that MF's  A**   I bet all on you, I have zero doubts.
“Your welcome Dubai” Nate is the best😂
Hope Nate pulls this off and doesn't get more hits to his head/face as from what I see all this fighting has really affected his speech over the years. Good Luck Nate!!
The best Nate interview in forever.
This interviewer is really good at his job for getting Nate to be comfortable and open up. He can be a hard nut to crack
★DIAZ ★ ARMY ★ 4 ★ LIFE! ★
Another true gladiator, up there with Mike Tyson in my book
Nate gonna shock the world again
WAR DIAZ!!!
Nate is a Legend no matter how the fight turns out 💯
Nates actually right. He is the greatest ufc fighter of all time🙏
Maybe the punches messed him up. Nate just sounds different, speech super slurred.  AND NO it’s not just because he smoeks
Nate all night fr
Legend
*This Chole-E-Toe is going to get humiliated this weekend by this Abraham Lincoln looking Russian. Talking all this nonsense in this interview.*
was this hard to watch for anyone else? Nate is clearly struggling to speak...and Brett makes it as awkward as possible.
He’s got it, pure determination
Much love and respect to you,and your bro!! Good luck buddy👍🏻
kinda sounds and talks like tyson. kinda sad, seems like some bad cte way he keeps trailing off and repeating or not answering the question. hope its not cte. hope he smashes saturday
Weed talking
Love Nate, but audio is extremely low and video quality isn't the best. Step it up for Nate, ESPN.
fkn love nate, what a character, hope life is good for him post ufc
Nate has unfinished business with Masvidal first! Rematch next!?
1st round sub via triangle. Double finger f bomb for the win
*Nate is scared and I’m sure everyone that watched this video agrees. Poor guy is having a tough time speaking and the way he’s putting his hands over his head stressing and saying if Khamzat beats me who cares I’m the # 2 guy in ufc. This is sad to watch*
He speaking better know I think not as punch drunk
LFG NATE!! WE TAKIN EVERYTHING THAT NIGHT!!!
Nathan Donald Diaz is a national treasure.
Newborns speak more coherently.  Nate is finished.
He needs to retire with that record
Love nate but hes lookin old and not ready no more
Choke him out Nate
was this filmed with a potato?
14:23 "youre welcome dubai" WHAAAAT? DUBAIIII??? IM DYING RN
Nate - I refuse to be lame! Yes boy go smash it!
respekt
Nate is was always will be an enigma
12:38
Horrible interviewer/host
LMFAAAOOO THE WAY HE WAS MAKING FUN OF USMANS "BACKROOM TALK" HAD ME ROLLINGG
I love this guy to death, but I hope he retires after this one!!!
This is why we love Nate. Straight up. Real raw west coast gangster. Let’s go Nate. We with you 💯 always
“I refuse to be lame” 😂😂
Big Nate
Great Interview
Diaz brothers are the People's champs ....BMFS
The more I think of it, the more I realise its a win win for the UFC. Either Khamzat wins and builds his star. But if Diaz wins could you IMAGINE the ppv buys if he signs a contract to fight for the title????
The TUF story about all the fighters sitting like school kids in trouble cracked me up
Most real guy ever!!
What a guy
I love Fedor Melanko
Why don’t they give unlimited time and put them in the dog house see who wins. I think Nate would kill that dude on unlimited time
The greatest end to an interview.  "This was a great interview Brett I have to go." 33:10 A "G" at the top of his game.
What a g man. Nate your a beast man🙏🤙
I'm a Chechen and Chimaev's fan and I hope that in the end Nate is gonna feel happy how he's been treated by UFC and his career ended. Nate is a great guy and a fighter.
Come ON!! Nate!! Fans vs haters are like the odds of this fight. Fukn lopsided😂5%haters & 95%Fans.
Diaz is one of the hardest mo fos who ever stepped into the game. Period.
Great interview, but cmon ESPN, 720p? Is it 2015? Gotta step your pixels up
He's starting to sound like peppa pig use defense and not your face u slurring gangster
Somebody needs to make a movie on Diaz brothers.
“I’ve never been in a position to fight for a title”…. Lol if he beat Leon edwards he would have had a title shot 😂
23:15 so we’re your teammates Jake and Gilbert
Nate is going down in UFC history as one of the most badass mf’s ever
Nick poured out his fighting soul into this interview
So much respect for Nate.  A fighter in his heart for sure.
For this to be trending number 4 shows the popularity of Nate.
Nate is the People’s GOAT
This foo said he’ll fight Ngannou 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nate should make all his interviewers smoke first or no interview!
Pressures on you cuz IDGAF!! Lol
I love this guy! He's given great emotions watching his great fights!!!  Take you, Nate...you are an eternal legend!!!💪
NATE - LIVER SHOT, TAKE HIS SOUL WITH A BODY SHOT TO THE LIVER (KICK OR PUNCH) AND ALL THE WRESTLING GOES AWAY.
That’s crazy how everyone goes to the arena for the interview at the front of the media but To interview Nate you have to go to him
Met the dude down in Ca and talked to him for a good hour. Dude is really down to earth and just wants his name to have the respect he deserves on it.
nate looks scare af
Dana put all this effort to promote the legend, to have him have the most, to be on the the peak to have him more opportunities to choose from. Hail ufc to get this guys where they are
He's telling nothing but truth and nailed it! You got this Nate!! He has a point to fight  whoever and anywhere. True badass martial artist🥋
What he is saying is scary true even though it's hard to decipher sometimes.
Bret had 50 questions to ask. He asked maybe 5😂
12:37 when it all changes 🤣🤣
I love diaz and hopefully he shocks the world but 27 vs 38 years old, this will not go well.
Nate’s impression of Kamaru is the best!!! Even changed his voice!!!😂😂😂
I don't know what he said but sounded good!
He reminds me of Mike Tyson. When he was not fighting any more. He should have taken an easy fight or not to step into the ring again. It feels wrong if you have any brain. That guy should rest as he is a living legend of this "sport", reminder of the good and bad old days...
No Nate, they’re the best because they actually WIN fights. Everytime your in a position to be a title contender you lose
Team Diaz, let’s go!
Nate deserves to fight 155 he is a 155 just doesn't cut weight
Marc Raimondi should do these
They need to make a movie about Nate Diaz starring Mark Walburg
I think the only person who beats Nate up so much is himself. The Lad is so genuine and honest good luck for Saturday.
23:52
10-8 Brett vs Ariel
Nate says alot of stuff just rambling then eventually it all comes together lol but hes a deep thinker thats why
Nate’s already won by turning up love Nate’s honesty man can see the insecurity and anger still gonna turn up an never quit win lose or draw Nate always wins man
I can not wait for this fight
WAR DIAZ! C'mon!!!
It’s just too bad they are only 2 brothers
nate talking like UFC wanted him to take the dive against chimaev to "build" him up hmmmm
Already the most legendary interview in mma ever.
Diaz is someone you can look up to👊
Let's go nate!!!!!!!!! Get it done
Let’s go nick Diaz army all or nothing
One of the best fight weeks i can remember and we are not even there yet. Special fight for sure gives me goosebumps just thinking about it
9:49 LOL his impersonation of Usman is too accurate hahahahaha
Nate, he is a real one.
5y5y 35y
5y y5y5y5
54 44t
tttwtt
Nate is a real one. He speaks facts
What he said?
Nate is so right. The UFC is screw-in him with this fight. Plain and simple.
Find it funny that they show the worst vids of him speaking yet most of this interview he sounds just fine
Such a team player man. He wasn't negotiating for money he wanted his boys to get contracts.
Top G! 👊 Then. Now. Forever 🙏
He's delusional. Brain is scrambled.
Nate Diaz is an icon, will never forget all the memories he has given us over the years. Hopefully he can give us one more this Saturday.
Nate would have to fight a new born baby girl for me to cheer against him. As raw as it gets.
my man came out of the womb wearing a black T
im cheering for ya brother...in my mind ur the wolf n chimaev is the clown...submit that clown
Never understood why people love this guy so much…
If someone deserves a miracle is Nate. He deserves to leave the UFC in his terms beating one of their best fighters shouting once again "I'm not suprise mfs".  It's a small probability, but if you are not rooting for Nate on this one... you have problems.
Nate we love you brother.  Please find a way to stay with the ufc. We have 3 top class big money rematchs waiting on us you fights ill bring my truck and trailer to carry your money home. Let's go Nathan Diaz...... Nick Diaz army for life MF.S
Nate is gone beat his dunies down
He is truly the last of the raw ufc era. I wish more fighters told it like it was instead of being cupcakes. Thats why we love the Diaz Bros real g's
Just put the "Realest Muthafucker on the Planet" belt around this man's waist rite now!
Nate “I’m the champion of the whole UFC” Diaz ✊🏽
Let’s go Nate!
on 1.5x Speed he sounds normal
My champ
I feel a pain I dont truly understand or cant comprehend. I am a friend of this guy and his brother that i will never meet.
NATE DIAZ MIKE TYSON HOT BOXING  MAKE IT HAPPEN !
Legend.
Gotta love Nate.
HE REMINDS ME OF WHITE TYSON
This is stupid Chimaev will annihilate Nate. This is just additional CTE damage. So fu.
Nate loses in the first 3 minutes, but I get what he says. Other fighters are robotic, political, and boring feet stompers. BMF belt should be a real belt defensed on PPVs just for this reason alone..Tony Ferguson’s, McGregor’s, Diaz, Lawler, Jorge, Chandler, Deez Nutz
This reporter needs an award for keeping his composure listening to this guy dribble incoherently for longer then a minute. Honestly Diaz is so dumb he should be the poster child of why not to do combat sports due to an acquired brain injury
Great interview! Glad Nate got to speak his mind
Let’s go Nate. I hope he wins and wins big. Then one more fight with edwards and walks away champ
The dark horse of the UFC. Forever respected!
Nate high af talkin nonscence
Am not surprised mother fuckers😂 Go nate,out in style like the G you are..
Nate only way you can get your revenge is to take knee and walk away.. that would be straight G move
Don't know why but the way he said 16:27 "You fought Burns dawg, you fought Burns?" Had me howling 😂😄
I'm not surprised motherxxxxxxx 💙🍀👑 Hope you win brother 🔊
So glad we don’t have to listen to this rambling idiot after Saturday! BYE BYE
Is this stupidity, brain damage, weed or all of the above????
Love is what I got for Nate in this interview
Nate's future looks very bright in the UFC! 👍👍👍😍
Somehow Usman get under Nicks skin. Btw Fk Usmans fake behind.
Brain damaged. Made no sense half the time sorry
Hmmmmm I wonder why he can’t sell fights…..
Win or Loss  Dgaf This is a Legend This is The Slapping Stocktonite Himself  Smoking NATE DIAZ
The man 💪🏻
Nate is real deal but sounds like he’s taken to many punch’s good luck hope you get the win og
Khamzat watching the interview on loop... DON'T BE SCARED HOMIE
Nate i love you to death❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
man... Nate talks alot of nonsense.
I love how Nate just ends the interview.
Nate will go all the way hope it doesn’t get stopped by a cut this time
Look into his eyes...all war...
Is it just me or at 21:55/56 the quality just looks awful for a while? And why are most but not all ESPN interviews are at 720p and not 1080p. Like this interview and the one with khamzat its also only 720p?anyone explain
Wow, he's starting to look a lot like his older brother
I guarantee you Nate loves to smoke weed and thinks drugs are cool.
He is a true Fighter
SH,T HOT,ENJOYED THAT!
This interview sounds like some kind of counseling session.
He did it his own way. I respect that. Hope he wins on Saturday good luck from Ireland Nate.
this man 100% has brain damage.... i hate to say it, but it's true
Nate reminds me of the guy in the factory who only had a 9th grade education and blames the world for his life but in reality just isn't smart enough to now he just isn't smart enough.
nate i know you going to lose but i don’t give a fk ..im still going to be your fans..
"I refuse to be lame" rethinks all the gallons of blood he looses per match
I wanna see Nate invited to Hotbox With Mike Tyson after this
It's always uncomfortable watching him repeatedly contradict himself.  I always feel bad for him like we are exploiting a mentally challenged person.  BTW, he DID fight for a title against Ben Henderson and he lost badly.  So when he says he was never in position for a title, he's wrong.  Nick was given a title shot against GSP when he was coming off of a loss.  So again, wrong.  Now he claims to be the best in the UFC, yet he feels Chimaev is unfair for him.  He says he's been fighting top 10 fighters, but he's lost to every WW he's fought.  He says the UFC rankings don't mean anything and that he has friends that are tougher.  Then he says the best fighters will always be in the UFC.  ???
YOU FOUGHT BURNS! 😂 OG NATE!
Buying this fight jus cuz Diaz.  He ain't lookin' for handouts, he's a long-term fighter, an "artist".  This IS the fight of the year.
It's almost like listening to White Mike Tyson of MMA... lol.  I do like watching Nate's fights, just like brother Nick he's never out of it, even when he's getting the sh!t knocked out of him, he's still in it to the last second, a cage warrior to the end.
Nate’s Usman impression 🤣 9:48
Wait, did he really say he’s not the right “color” for the ufc? Dude don’t tell Me Nate is one of THOSE🫠  Don’t be THAT guy Nate, I like you too much dude lmao
He actually does a decent Usman impression 😂 9:50
Diaz brothers are true warriors!
I'm with you bro 💯 💪  I'm on this train since day 1 I'm also hyped on Kamzat or whatever but I'm rolling wit y'all. Let's get it Nate 💪
Legend
Basically it's all corrupted, I pick Nate!
I like both to some extent but between the two I root for Nate Diaz to come out on top of this. Khamzat need to be humbled and so does the organization.
Just a totally off topic thing to say but does anyone else get vibes with Nate in his interviews he reminds you of Mike Tyson??
“ I refuse to be lame”…….that’s all ya  need to hear
@ESPN MMA SOUND AND PIC QUALITY IS FROM 2002.
My money will ALWAYS be on one of the Diaz brothers. Always.
The Legend of Nate Diaz
Nate, my family has felt so super cool watching you fight!  Without a doubt our absolute favorite!!!  You are a true warrior and very happy to watch again!!!
"You take steroids, I'll smoke weed, lets get in there and scrap." Is the most Nate Diaz thing I have ever heard in my life.
Diaz vs Ngannou 😂
WoW... Win or lose Diaz is Victorious!
Punch drunk
"You should've work on a computer somewhere you nerd" LMAO
Nate finna go out there like a warrior ready to die in battle. Lets go Nate 🙌🏽
REAL GANGSTER...
lol    This is why we love the Diezs   They make their own world!
“Hold on let me put my pants on” 😅😂
Much respect to Nate..Buy my man Gotta stop smoking before interviews..lmao 🤦🏻‍♂️
I love Nate, but I do feel like he missed the mark on Usman lol. Usman is a good dude, and the thing with Izzy that Nate referenced was just a joke. Hope Nate gets the W against Majin Khamzat.
I wish they wouldn’t have bleeped his cursing 😂
Nate Diaz: 😳 "I'm the Champion of the Whole UFC all Together"  "..and I don't give a F÷@K"  🤯12:30  _2022
Feels like he realises all this on the spot lmaoo
Id love to sponsor the page and all things nate.  Please let me know.
Great interview
Let’s go Nate, I hope he is not surprised again 🙏🏻
Nate Diaz the real GOAT!
i love nate hes my favorite fighter but is it me or does he seem to have bad cte or something its got way worse than it used to be
And this is why he is a super star
Nate carrying a lot of pain with him to the top!
Good luck 🍀 Nate from a Conor fan, smash Khamzat braddah.
Diaz brothers are the GOATS!!
Nate’s so delusional.   Can’t wait to see him leave the UFC and lose to scrubs in PFL.
Tony and nate on the same card, out to prove the doubters wrong. Cant wait for these fights
He's setting himself up for a title shot.
Let’s go Nate
Nate and Nick are wayyyyyyyyyy over rated !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
wish this wasnt espn censored the f*** up 14:39-15:23 would be even more of legendary moment by nate
Can’t believe Nate is such an underdog in this one. Maybe if it was a 3-round fight, but this could go into deep waters that Khamzat hasn’t seen before. Would love to see Nate prove everyone wrong again.
Not a bright man at all
!Nate Diaz Army 💯 going to war!
“If you’re a goat then, make a goat” ND
He is really one of the best in town....
720p in 2022?? Are you f'real ESPN?!?
Nate could've won a belt had he focused less on showing how touch he is and more on blocking. But I guess it wasn't his goal from what he's saying here.
This was a great interview Brett! I got to go…
I wish Ariel Helwani can interview him before his fight.  Ariel would tear down all the barriers Nate has up.  You can see how hesitant Nate is to answer.  Ariel Helwani is the GOAT of MMA journalism.
🐐
"I refuse to be lame!" Nate Diaz
OMg...Nate looks Scared !!!
Diaz is so right  This wouldn't even be worth the ppv to be honest if he wasn't chimaev opponent
He is our brother. That's it. He is the doppest
Nate is one of The VERY few OGs left in The game, also that fights at top level. He has fought for 18 years! Always fighting The very best.
Stay off the drugs kids......
Say what you will!  Nate is 10000000% correct! And the most REAL in the WHOLE  UFC!!!!!
Let’s all take a moment to make credit that this 4 in trending
I hope Nate whoops that gourmet Chechen
His whole styles giving white mike Tyson
This dude talks like he’s been hit in the head 1 to many times
Ride or die Diaz family. I love the brothers and what they represent. Whatever they do I will follow. They don't need fighting to make a living. They are at position that gives them the world in their hands.
There is no lying in Nate -
The end of interview was the best Nate is a real gangster mane came to interview in basketball shorts real hood fighter style love the Diaz brothers forever
Nate is every bit as crazy and delusional as Tony fergusion !!
If diaz could ever team up with McGregor for his new fight promotion that just might take over the UFC
Mane what it’s some boring as ufc fighter mane work at a cubicle
He is the most durable fighter lve ever seen...
We are cheering for you Nate!  Never seen Nate get emotional.. He has so many points.
I HATE when 2 fighters I like have to fight...But may the best man win... Just have a good clean fight. That's all I can ask for. Both leave the fight in good health.
i didnt like the way this was going in the begining, nate wasnt making much sense. but from the middle to the end, it all came together perfectly!
Hope Nate gets the job done, rooting for him
Work on your audio levels.
Too much weed or too many punches ??
Usman lost Amanda lost. Anything is.possible
OG
MVP of UFC in the past Decade!
Ima resign and get a rematch the best quote in this interview
Say what    ?
He’s undoubtedly a legend. We all love Nate. You know it’s gonna be a good fight if he’s in it.  Having said that I do struggle to listen to him. I’m a positive person and this dude is so negative all the time. Who works for a company for so long but spends their whole career slagging the place off.
Win or lose, Diaz army all day!👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽
#3 on trending.  Not a needle mover???
If ur the goat make a goat🔥
How dare you censor a Nate Diaz interview!
SOMEONE NEEDS TO TELL NATE LOL YOUR NOT BLACK.
LETS GO NATE!!! Don’t gotta prove shii to anyone you already a G.O.A.T!!!
I can’t wait for his hall of fame speech
Mannn to think of a Ferguson vs. Diaz fight </3
I know a lot of people laugh at the goat talk but if Nate somehow pulls it off this saturday hes legitimately one of the best lightweight/welterweight ever.
He high or cte kicking in? Honest question
The Jon Jones/ GOAT part was on point. Real as it gets!
What nate says about Jon Jones is 100% true Jon Jones should never be considered a goat when he wa raided and cooked out his entire career
Agree with Nate the people cheering even when Nate lose  I’m sorry he’s the peoples champ I agree he slayed some killers on his record on soul and never been knocked out  cold never
I know nate talks like this but I  think he's so high right now that he doesn't even no who he's talking to right now lol
Anyone else find him hard to understand?
Let’s go nate god bless
Okay but did anyone notice the ghost opening the door  0:13
I love Nate but he has taken so many shots to the head he can hardly form a sentence.
Nates Kimaru Usman impression was pretty accurate
Nates a legend.
The most overrated fighter in the history of the UFC
I like Nate, but haven't a scooby do what hes on about here..
NATE = GOAT  Im ready for "Im not surprised mofo #2"
Love this guy plse let him win will make me believe there’s still good in this world
How Nate closed the interview was sick 😂
209 is rooting for you all the way man! STOCKTONE ALL DAY
This is worth more than Gold 🔥
How is discount Ariel not laughing at this clown Diaz? 😂😂😂
Bro it’s hard to hate Nate Diaz and his brother they are warriors
LONG LIVE DIAZ!!
Awesome interview. Amazing guy.  Good job by interviewer letting nate talk etc.  Just one small thing, please stand up and shake Nates hand at the end!  Nate is a legend, respect.
This dude stopped McGregor in his prime.. Why is everyone saying he's gonna get steamrolled??
Anybody ever notice he sounds like Mike Tyson 😱
I'm swedish and love khamzat ofc, but somehow I can't help but route for Nate!
Nate Diaz if ain’t war time it don’t feel right I agree
Love him
Nate is a modern day warrior
Dude seems like he's not into this fight, almost seems depressed. Dude even said recently he never wanted this fight....not good foreshadowing
Lone man beating up the wrong guy. Doesn't he know he's in the best selling show.
Nate Diaz: the people’s champs.
I'm a big nate fan but he has brain problems  it sounds like Parkinsons
I hope Nate 🏆
Nate diaz round 1 triangle choke
CTE is a very REAL condition and Nate clearly has it and is NOT doing well. Shame on the UFC for letting this fight happen under their banner. I fear for his well being, he is in cognitive decline and the UFC only cares about making money.  I hope he gets outta this one with minimal head trauma,  Good luck Nate!
Nate is definitely gonna lose.
Great interview
Seems like a man that has gone through tremendous suffering
You can do steroids and I can smoke weed… top Nate quote right there😂😅
CTE is real.
😂 😂 😂 He calling Izzy a nerd
Emotional,  can't be arsed with it , just doing it cause it feels right .
THE ENTIRE UFC WORLD CHAMPION  NATE DIAZ!!!!
“Where’s your facts?”  Tell ‘em Nate!
Letssss Goooooo.  @FirstSmokeOfTheDay ✌🏼💨💨💨
So dellusional
Nate gonna stop this guy like he did McGregor !!
Living legend
You can’t ducking I think you are stupid you never been champion you always lost and still talking
Love how Nate’s showing love to the OG Fedor Melenko
Nate Diaz is a legend.
He's a true warrior. Win or lose he has everyone's respect.
Let's go Nate! NDA!!
If he would’ve smoked less weed and trained way harder for example like Khabib, he would’ve been one of the greatest fighters but whenever you watch Nate Diaz fight he always loses. Even tho I like him, he’s cool.
1.2 million views, only him and Connor pull these numbers…put some respect on Diaz
You the real champ!! LFG, Nate!!!
Couldn't Even Film Nate In 4K Or 1080p I Know BS YouTube Channels W Better Production, Shame On ESPN
Nate should use BLESSED - Ocean wisdom as his walk out song 🤷‍♂️🙏
What is that quality ? 140p ?
NATE I FEEL YOUR ENERGY ABOUT LIFE IN GENERAL. A REAL SAMUARI
Diaz ARMY!!! Lets go!!! 💯💯🔥🔥
CTE. He is delusional
Nate love from Greece! I hope you shock the whole world,  we all are with you!
Legendary!!! From almost setting it on Dana to getting his whole Team Signed. I no longer wanna hear about anyone else but Nate. Insane Interview. UFC needs the Diaz brothers
Nate army cuhhh
Nate is raw and uncut.
After the fight: I'm not suprised #######!
720 p ? Is it 2008
Who named their kid Dana that's a girl's name did you ever see about six or seven years ago when he used to look like he was a scrawny little kid couldn't even fit in his suit that was tailored LOL now look at him a couple of roid sessions later I think so
has he ever had a title shot?
“Fedor Malenko”
You got your back here in Texas Nate!
Nate sounds like he's taken way to many shots to the head. He'll be eating through a tube before long.
If you close your eyes and listen, you can actually hear the guy interviewing Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) from 16 Blocks
I agree he's the best in whole UFC, but not fighting skill for skill. In the sense of he hast the biggest heart in the cage, never quits, never gets tired, but he really is the best at entertaining fans!!! He's loyal, so in return the fans are gonna be loyal to him. Because he does show up and he is always standing at the end. You're a hater if you don't enjoy this dude.
Let’s go Nate!! 🔥🔥 209
And I understood, but I didn't understand, but now I really understand - Nate Diaz

If there was ever a person that has ZERO chance to win a fight its Nate this time
Nate ‘I’ve been the longest in the game, ever since I got here’ Diaz
more people need to be like the diaz brothers. Do their own thing ignore the status quo
Love nate but he going to get smashed
Stockton legend
Crème de la crème!!!
Nate is real og! I hope ufc and cummshot gets smoked
Pulling for ya Nate. Expose that Chin. You got the gas tank. Go get this phony.
I really appreciate the straight up openness that Nate gave here. He could have easily been like F this, and barely spoke thru this interview. It's happened before. BUT he was honest, he said what if I get whooped? What if? Does that mean he did Nothing for anyone? After all these year's? The "tactics" the organization takes. The UFC should be nothing other than respectful and accommodating towards their "assets"  because without them, they would have ZERO income coming. I really like that Nate showed love towards Dana White, for real. I am happy that Nate is doing Real Fight Inc. just to have a great passion project, and broadening the MMA community because the UFC is amazing but needs to realize that they gotta evolve a bit. IT AIN'T THAT HARD and it ain't that much. It's just asking for a little flexibility. I really hope they can see it's not that much, it's not that difficult...
*Hand motions fighter tier*  *Can't find the words*  "I'm the champion of the champion of the whole UFC"  No cap
sounds like hes already preppin for the loss
Everybody got a homie or wants a homie like nate
Nate was soo high he’s eyes were shutting off 😂
Nate Diaz is the fkn man
This kid knows he’s going to the gallows it’s a shame.
He was totally stoned
Nate is the baddest, most realist dude to ever do this!  The last part of the interview where he talked about people going to see a fight is 100% on point. And immediately after that, he basically dropped the mic and bailed out on the interview like robbery.  Much love to the Nate brothers!
I wish he was 100 healthy for this fight 😔😔😔  Nate, please bro. I know you don't know me but please. Live your life bro. You have nothing else to prove to us.
Spitting straight about champion status. Never thought about it that way.
Nate round 4 choke
"If your mr. Goat then make a goat"😂 why did that make hella sense to me tho💀
Nate’s got a code
Best Nate interview ever. Got to see a couple different sides which is cool. I hope he pulls it off.
Too much weed
The man might not always win but he always brings the big fight vibes its feels like a huge fight because of diaz and yes some of it has to do with khamzat but honestly mostly because of diaz
LOL Brett only got to ask like two of his questions
ANYONE KNOW WHERE TO WATCH THIS FIGHT FOR FREE ??? 🙏
Nate diaz literally is spitting facts…all these greatest ever or these over hyped fighters get paid way more and get to pick and choose fights and all this because it’s basically who the ufc is getting the word out about. These poor other fighters that should get title shots get surpassed with the dude that has the most likes or tweets or whomever is popular at the time or aren’t as good as these guys that have been in the ufc for awhile. Like Nate says they just leave…retire. No one wants to wait around for a fight no matter what rank you are in the division. When some dude that shows up has more backing by people that don’t even know the sport just the character created. Straight up wwe …Nate’s winning this but I have a feeling if it goes to the judges it’s over for Nate
"if you are Mr GOAT then make a GOAT" - Nate Diaz
2 Words...... PUNCH DRUNK
I love Nate Diaz, always been a fan & always will be!!! But Nate Diaz is burnt out & delusional Smfh sad!!
can't wait to hear what he plays for his ring walk
Please remove Anik from conducting these interviews.
I heard he's gonna be co-starring in a movie called "Autistic Gangsters"
Best fighter? He is washed up fighter..you probably gonna fight Jake Paul in few years
REAL G. L-F-G
Nate looked a bit down on energy or maybe emotional.. p.s ESPN recorded & edited this with a potato.
amazing interview,,,,youve already won the fight Nate
Jon Jones. “Who” ? 🔥
Nate "I don't give a F***" Diaz
There couldn’t have been a worst person to asl questions for this interview
All I want is for Nate to eat some steak so we can have Nate 2.0.
I’m not surprised Motherfuckers!!! I hope that we see another triangle with double fingers ridin high as a direct message to UFC.  Let’s go Nate!!!
Brain trauma and 200 pounds of weed to the head = Nate Diaz
That interview was pure gold. Nate says just enough to make you almost think he’s on to something lol….
I feel for Nate man, guys put his whole life into this company and they are doing him so dirty in his last fight
nate is constantly drunk
Nate to kill chimawhatever his name is. 🤙
22:35 this why I love Nate lol
Legend
Living legend!
Nate’s the 🐐 win, lose or draw
What a huge burnout , nam saying'?
You fought burnz dawg...  ya fought burnz... 😂😂
There is something deeply spiritual about what Nate is saying- it’s intertwined with the UFC but also completely independent of it
3rd round.
Against all odds
Nate diaz my brotherrr love youuuu
Bret ever the company man almost couldn't keep his mouth shut more than he did.
I’d like Nate to win but I see that old cut he has that kind of opens with a good punch causing a stoppage
Tony Ferguson, Yoel Romero, Nate Diaz, Diego Sanchez, Rampage ...  The most legendary interviews in MMA history
Nate Diaz is the biggest star in the UFC…period!!!
Let’s go! Nate!
Nate should be given the hall of fame for what he's done and how long he's been in the ufc
Fire some reason he sound like mike tython
"I'm making this guy." 100% true Nate knows what he's talking about.
Never watched a full interview until I watched this one , this one was worth watching
You guys must stop calling it a interview when it comes to Nick and Nate the title should be Nate talks for a hour.
Between Biden and Nate I've still not understood most of their sentences.
Great interview, but why is the Worldwide Leader in Sports recording this in like suboptimal 720p? Nate can't even get the 1080 treatment?
What a man! Absolute legend of the fight game. A true warrior. Hope he shocks the world this weekend
The Nick Diaz Army Mutha F#*%ers!!! Go Get Em Nate... (The People's Champ) 🏆 🏆 🏆
His thoughts are Leon are interesting. Great interview!
Man knows how to sell a fight
Nate is a promoting genius
Nate is such a real one he literally ended the interview on his on terms 😂😂
nate will win
I’m shocked he stayed for the entire interview.
Nate reminds little bit of Mike Tyson (the way he talks) Like if u agree ?
The way he ended the interview! Lol!!!
Nate army motha fuckas!!!!!!!
Love Nate and everything he brings to the table but there is clear signs he’s taken too much damage just by listening to him talk. Regardless hope he beats hazmat a**!!
Nate diaz is the best
9:49 usman impression was on point!
Always will stand with Nate
Narrative Nate "narrative"
I kinda feel sad...
“If your F’n Mister GOAT then make a GOAT, prove it.”  “This is only halftime”
Bret makes you feel like you’re sitting down talking to a shrink in his interviews
this man is a legend!!!
The Diaz brothers always have the realest interviews ever.
Great interview , Nate has incredible charisma
I hope Nate goes out in real Nate Diaz style.
This the mood of someone who knows he bout to shock the world again
Man i am from Germany and its really hard for me to understand him....
Its so hard to follow this guy…i can barely understand what he’s saying and he’s talking so slow 🤣.Too much weed in the blood my guy. Gunna get smoked Saturday 💨
This one hit differently. Big new found respect for The big dawg Diaz. That's a real life warrior right there.
When is the press conference today?
Brett Okamoto is legit . Met him in a lobby and seems like a very decent guy , no shady business like Ariel and the other snakes . Great interview
Describing his mindset of going home a champ as long as he did it his own way is very touching, but as always the copium is flowing strong with Diaz. A true warrior regardless. Speaks a lot of truths and has some great stories to tell after such a long career.
why is this not in HD lol
Love the man but he's lost way too many braincells
Nate: "Knaw I'm sayin'?" Bret:  "Mhm. Mhm. Mhm." Me:  ............No F'n clue my brother......
Nate is awesome.   His brain has been scrambled a bit from all the hits.
This fools punch drunk
this is how you sound after geting punched in the head for 20 years straight
Is this nates last bret  interview 😔😔
People in here commenting about how he has CTE and punch drunk don’t realize how insightful Nate is. Dude is sharp in a way not everyone can be. If you can’t understand him and immediately say he’s ‘dumb’ while disregarding what he’s actually saying- then you’re just showing your own ignorance. Part of it has to do with being familiar with the slang and patterns of speech he uses. It’s like Ebonics, if you weren’t raised around it, you don’t know what 3/4 of it means… people like me, and others in this thread, who were prob raised in California or come from an urban (Mexican American , black, etc) culture understand exactly what he’s saying. And it’s pretty deep , he understands the in’s and outs of the “business” of UFC better than 90% of the fans and fighters.  Nate Diaz is the real deal and has taken extensive damage through the years, so I hope he comes out with this relatively unscathed and with a W.
I hope he wins 🙏
Am I tripping or Nate is really a genius
Nate's real fight is constructing a proper sentence.
Wish you the best of luck boss! But man it’s sad seeing what all these years of fighting has done to you cte is real!!!
love me some stockton slap but yo Nate is HIGH AF on this interview.
Fuc$&#*! Legend!
i think  if Nate wins he’ll bang one of the coldest octagon interview ever, before he out from ufc. it can be more epic than calling out Mcgregor and after fight I’m not surprised m’fckers
DIAZ ARMY💯
This interview was one for the AGES and the wild part is this is the last conversation he has under the UFC umbrella. Nate go shock the world and smack Khamzat around!
How rich is he
I’m not a Nick or Nate fan Persia but hope he gets lucky with this fight, I’d love a Nate 4th or 5th round TKO. Take him to DEEP waters Nate!! Good luck
win or lose but nate is the best of the best
Nate diaz is the guy who could be a truck driver and still enjoy his job
Dont have enough money for decent and loud sound?
Nate's interview has double the views of chimaev's in half the time. 1.1 million in 1 day vs 667,000 in 2 days.
Those contract negotiations were fun af. UFC execs were really getting their minds fooked with this guy.
This man does not want to fight. I love Nate, but his demeanour is breaking my heart. I wish him health and prosperity. ~This fight just does not seem right.
Can someone translate this for me ?
This like I'm watching breaking bad again.....
Lets f***in go Nate!
This dudes a cabbage
Nick either smokes too much weed or is starting to show signs of low CTE
Nate is such a dog. Max respect to the dude. Let’s go!
This man Sounds like he's on the verge of breaking down pull any money off this dude right now
Should've really given him Ngannou.
Smoke after the interview next time Nate! 😁 Even as a Swede I am on your side in this fight!
Don’t count him out, khamzat is a beast yes, but no one has Nate’s gas tank and khamzat don’t have his bjj, let’s see what happens, everyone counted Nate out against Conor the first time. Shocked the world he’s the only one capable of this.
That's the best way anybody ever finished an interview!
Nate says this fight is about making Kazmet. Nate Diaz is right. Don't ever tell me that Nate Diaz isn't smart.
Nate is the real Champ.
Nate is gonna win, let's shock the ufc & world OG 🔥
if you bet $500 on Nate and he wins...   you get $6,250  (Obviously he has no chance but those are great odds)
The way he ends the interview Top G 😅
When Nate beats Khamzat:  Joe: you just shook the world! Nate: aye I’m not surprised MF!
He knows he’s losing the fight , but you gotta respect the fact from his ultimate fighter beginning to now his last fight he never changed.
Classic Diaz, realest delusional dude interview! Love it
This will be a epic fight
Wow! JUST WOW! I’m from france. And i never thought i was going to say that about Nate, but this is one of 2 maybe 3 most powerful mma interview. The indirect subliminal messages, inside what he’s saying.  👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🫡🫡🫡
This was a great interview Brett I have to go 😂😂💯💯
Nate by submission round 3. Reply me
Dana white Should be ashamed of himself Feeding him too That killer Should had made the Conor vs Nate triolgy too send Nate off in the Sun 🌞
Sit down Dana and Nate on a table and record it… it will be the best ppv event ever 😂
Betting 100 hard earned British pounds on Diaz for the W.
Nate is a real gangster
Lmao best interview ever I forgot he was even being interviewed. The interviewer completely lost control of his task. Lmao
This guy is full of himself. He sucks and thinks he is the best. Kamaru Usman will mop the floor with this guy. Any fighter top 50 will whoop him.
Love how he calls out all the bs of others like Usman.
Get that Mfr Nate! 🤜😵‍💫
Early signs of CTE showing, sad. Hope the fight goes smoothly and not too much more damage to his brain…
You are the champion of the whole UFC
Image someone interrogating Nate Diaz😂😂😂that’ll be fun💯
Nate you got the energy my G
I LOVED WATCHING YOU NATE YOUR WHOLE TIME IN MMA  LOVE TO SEE YOU FIGHT MORE BROTHER
24:06-24:10
Nate definitely lit a joint the second he left. I could tell by the way he left lmfaooo
Never been knocked out. My guy stays knocked out. Him and cerrone legends
“I refuse to be lame” -Nate Diaz
Il be praying for this man to Beat cumsat
There you go, the TRUTH is out now. I'm so glad this interview was made.
Nate diaz is the peoples champion. Win or lose everyone cheers for him because he fights and entertains. He drops his hands and brawls. He's a goat
He's trying to say that he wasn't supposed to win ever. Only until he called out mcnugget the money machine and kept winning did he get attn. They couldn't control the narrative. He's a true fighter but wasn't created by Dana white
'If you're Mr Goat then make a Goat...Prove it" - A Goat
This was hands down one of the greatest Nate Diaz interviews ever. Say what you want about him Nate is smart af understands his role in all of this and still manages to let us inside his mind. Diaz army all day!!
usman has rashad and his brother but whatever
Love and respect for Diaz Brothers ..Nathan can beat khamzat ... respect our legend u cumshot chimaev
Lmao gotta love the ending tho
Nate diaz is definitely the baddest motherfucker in the sport hes a fighter purist the purest most warriorlike mentality you can have the true definition of a fighter.
Lol. You can literally tell he's suffering from CTE.
They keeping him for McGregor 3 trust me. But when they negotiate he's cheaper cause he's coming off a loss
Diaz will knock out cumshot.chimaev ...Diaz will kill the 🐺
Robert DeNiro, Al Pachino, Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Sandler……the most famous athletes you could think of.
Nathan Diaz = Peoples Champ ✊🏻
He ain’t Eva lie
9:50 haha
I firmly stand behind Alec Baldwin, it’s just too dangerous to stand in front of him.
Not to many fighters that'll take the next world champion as their final opponent. thanx for the years nate
Its gonna be awsome
Props to Brett, for just asking a question and letting Nate talk. This is what a real interview is.
The CTE is strong with this one
Gotta love this guy.
Nate is obviously not the most eloquent guy out there, but he clearly knows how the game is played and what the UFC’s angle is. He’s a lot smarter than people give him credit for
His impersonation of Usman was hilarious haha
Weed Talk
Nate doesn't have CTE, CTE has Nate.
That Usman impression tho 09:50 😂 - was a bit TOO good! 👋
Much respect to Nate Diaz. This dude is scared of nobody! One of the best ufc fighters ever!
This wasn’t even an interview it was Nate speaking and Brett listening… I don’t really like Brett interviews but he just let Diaz roll and his questions just made Diaz speak more…gotta be the best Diaz interview ever so shout out to Brett aswell
Nah nah nah, if Nate wins this isn’t over. He’s skipping the line and fighting for the belt; Leon V Nate II.
i hope khamzat fight smart with nate don't over do
Great interview
The best part of any diaz brother interview is always the part where THEY decide the interview is finished.
😂 Bro! Nate saying he beat Leon Edwards when he lost every round and by unanimous decision. Just because he caught him in the last moments of the fight. Smh.
Hall of famer
I think nate has cte and thats sad
Nate is a beast
23:53 The way he said he would smoke weed and fight anyone on steroids as long as they were honest. This man is a gold mine of entertainment. 25:19 His idea that you aren't a goat unless you inspire others to do the same is such wisdom new found perspective on things.
Always 100% real.
it'll be a bigger upset than Leon versus Kamara. Let's go Nate.
a censored nate diaz interview is like a peanut butter and rock sandwich: it doesn't make sense and i don't want that
Are we ever gonna be in a world where Disney doesn't bleep cuss words, yet allows the most "brutal", demanding blood and guts sport to air on their platform? 🐭 👎
I am the champion of the UFC
I love nate but damnit we’re not gonna be able to understand him one day and everyone will be sad and act like everyone was an animal back then but what are we supposed to do this man’s about the fight game plain and simple
Best interview I have ever seen.   Nate is a warrior.
If he wants out of his contract, he should be able to just walk away.
Win or lose i'm gonna miss Nate Diaz
This interviewer is CLEARLY a Khamzat fan
His definitely high
Love Nate, it's gonna suck to watch him get mauled. He is not going to stuff any of the takedowns, does not have the power to rock Chimaev, not going to submit him, only chance he wins is Chimeaev starts to gas out and Nate overwhelms him with combos OR as he is gassing out, gets a takedown and Nate slaps on a slick submission, probably won't happen though. I bet ground and pound in the 3rd round is the way it goes
Chimaev had to try to fight Costa because he isn’t the centre of attention this week.
I respect everyone who were involved in this , seriously the best piece that I ' ve ever seen on YouTube ,Hats of the Well All ! Love your videos💓
You can see how Emotional he is.
NDA MOTHER FATHERS!
Nate’s the goat. Fact
War Diaz
dumb or punch drunk?
You’re welcome Dubai lmaooo
How much does anyone wanna bet Nate say he’s injured after he loses and that’s why he couldn’t “fully train”
I fought all too 10 fighters… well Nate there were only 10 fighters in that weight class back then 😂
GOAT. HE is speaking FACTS
I just like to watch Nate talk
My favorite Nate interview ever. I'd love to see him win this weekend. Win or lose he's still a legend, as is his brother Nick.
Nate is 1 of 1, Best in the world
He got the whole world behind him!!!!
Mad respect to Nate
When Nate Leaves UFC, I leave with him.
Shout outs to the interviewer to be able to keep up a conversation with Nate because that is hard to do lol. Nate seems to have a windows 95 processor.
Love Nate
The Champion of the whole UFC ladies and gentlemens.
Just look at the views between Kumshits interview and Nate's. Twice as many views and kumshits wouldn't be getting half as many views if he wasn't up against Nate. It's clear as day who is bringing in the revenue. Delusional kumshits fans thinking he brings in money. What a stupid fight. Only reason I'll be watching is in support of Nate
Am I the only one who gets Mike Tyson vibes from the way he speaks ?
You guys really suck for asking this guy to sit down and talk to y'all but then you censor what he says. 🤡🤡🤡
War Diaz!
Outstanding interview
Jesus Saves!!!
One of the best interviews I've seen, new respect for Nate (not that he cares 🤣).
He would benefit greatly from a speech coach.  People wouldn’t judge him so much if he can get his thoughts out coherently.  War NATE!!!!  WAR!!!!!
Anyone have any insight into the seeming paradox in the fact that Nate's criticisms of champions "being THIER Champ' and 'fighting who they want you to fight' -- and the fact that he admits  @ 14:00 that he is only fighting Chimaev because that is what the UFC wants?   Also curious 17:00 to why Nate would consider himself number 2 after a loss to Chimaev, when he said his number 1 status comes from his resume and tenure in the UFC.
"You should have worked on computers, you nerd."
Bruh he just wants to go smoke leave the man alone lol why you think he gives such stupid short answers lol
Nate speaking facts on how he's the ASide and going against the grain. He exposing on how he's being use to big up another fighter who's on the hype train. He the Anti poster boy💯💪🏽
brett's first question "so why do you do it?", no setup, no smalltalk, just obvious and blatant. He screams corporate puppet, trying to push their agenda with no opinion of his own. Honestly Brett has his moments but i'd rather listen to rain fall than hear these bumbling questions and immature demeanor.
You the man Nate !
CTE is real
UFC doing bad right now with no big hype if Nate still got to fighting 🤦🏽. John Jones where are you😂
Nate is my top 5 favorite fighter. I love this dude. I hope he isn't on anything.
Thug life
I love Nate excluded Jones out of the GOATS list bcuz of the PED he used. Soo many ppl still choose to disregard that fact like it’s irrelevant to his performance, thus, status.
Don’t count Nate out. He LOVES being an Underdog
Kham never killed gilbert and he wont kill you, khams also never been past the 3rd, hope you take him to the distance
Sports no drugs
Best UFC interview ever.
Hang em up Nathan…. U can barely speak
bruh nate is in his own world man , this dude does not give a f
Idk it rubs me the wrong way that this is the fight they give him for his last fight on the contract. It feels like they just threw it out there to get it over with. He deserves a proper pairing for his last fight. Let's be honest he's past his prime and now they put him up against the guy destroying everyone.. they need to find someone from his era. With What he's done for the UFC, he deserves more respect.
Nate Diaz is real top G.
Nate Diaz the GOAT of realness. On some next level stuff, Philosophy meets Principles meets Street
15:25 "Whatever his f**** name is. LOL he couldn't name Chimaev. Nate is going at everybody
nate being Nate, delusional, and the realest at the same time. lots of truths and lots of BS,  that he actually believes.
I’m rooting for Nate! Dude has always been a monster. Win or lose this man has never stopped coming at you.
Nate good loook hope u win 🥇 ur figher.  I been watching u  some match. And YouTube
Lav txa es ,baic im vrov tuftoxy gandona
Dam Nate throwing Shade at Kamaru 12:35 😂😂😂. Depending how this fight goes i want to see Nate vs Kamaru
TEAM DIAZ 4 LIFE. But u can tell Nate took many hits
The interview starts and ends when Nate says so. Great interview Brett, you let the man run the show.
Let's go Nate! Can't wait to see him slap this mf 😤 💪🏽
Just beat the champion ?? You gotta love him despite how delusional he is lol.
the cat sound like tyson
love Diaz brothers
We love Nick ! He is the UFC
That Usman impersonation was spot on by Nate Diaz😂😂😂😂
Nick made him, mad respect to his brother ❤️
I'm having a hard time understanding this guy nate
a lot of respect for nate saying if a fighter does steroids they can’t be the goat and their legacy’s ruined 💯
I have to respect his conviction.
Mhmm
He is never scared or worry!!!
Love this guy!!!
I wish nate was done fighting. It s bad for his health.
Brad: MMMMHH x 1,000
Did he call Brett a chump at the very end lol?
Does he have a brain?
"This was a great interview Brett, I have to go."  🤣
What's this about👀i mean it’s trending in my country
Nate is under dog    Beat. Pick Nate he gonna win nate is good fighter.
LEGEND!!!
Brett you're the man for this. Don't often get to see Nate like this.
One of the best UFC interviews ever.  Nate Diaz thank you.
Classic Nate. He’ll always be a UFC legend despite the treatment he’s received from the organization. Big respect to him for taking this fight.
Yo am i trippin or did he just say ill figjt a n***a on steroids ???
Stockton MF 209
hes 100% right all these fighters let their heads get huge with the ufc telling them they are the best ever to lose and be forgotten and have the process repeat itself with the next guy. i remember when stipe miocic was the greatest heavy weight fighter to do it , then lost and never got a title rematch.
Greatest philosopher of our time
Where can we find the unedited video?
He needs to walk out with Mike Tyson
This interviewer is so professional he got the best of nate diaz without interrupting or pissing him off
Listening to nate while stoned🤣🤣
“If you’re Mr. G.O.A.T then make a G.O.A.T” that is the biggest compliment anyone can give a mentor.
STOCKTON MOTHERFUCKERS STOCKTON STR8UP STOCKTON MOTHERFUCKERS DIAZ ARMY!!! Don't be scared HOMMIE......209
Nate and Nick made me watch the UFC and because of them, and them alone, I never left. Both are amazing human beings when you closely follow what they really really really are about. Thanks for the amazing ride you've given us all. You are iconic here in the Midwest.
why is the commentator trying to get Nate to say he's scared
They Brian damge  from to may hit in the head
I can't hear him swear but I can see him KO a dude.
this feels like a weird intervention 😭🤣🤣
God bless the Diaz family
A must win fight for nate. Go nate!
Some individuals brag about themselves being the best but an authentic hero doesn't need to prove anything & prefers to remain silent because people know who is the best !!
Only stupid army following stupid leader.. No attitude no achievement only smoked weed
The goats have all had belts thats the thing Nate.🤔. But your the people's Champ. Nothing bigger bro
come on Nate,  let's end with "I'm not surprised mofos
Ruin the plan Nate !!
It was a great interview, thank you Nate
Win or lose, much respect for Nate
The only fight Nate Diaz lost by finish was Josh Thompson and the other was against Jorge Mavidal (doctor stoppage)...He is one TOUGH MF'r.
He reminds me so much of Tyson for some reason.
18:00 what?? hahahaha
If speaking were his opponent he wouldn't stand a chance 😆
So sad clearly has sustained lasting damage to his head.
It was sad when he got on the topic of champions. You can see deep down it bothers him he was never a champion. Sounds miserable and bitter
Brett did a really good job here....Nate opened up big time, great interview...
Can't wait for nake Diaz vs Russian fuhk
How does anyone understand Nate? I’m legit lost.
He hates goodbyes he just goes.
Nate is the man!
I'm having a strong feeling that he's going to be finished in round 1 or 2
We love you Nate!!
You welcome u mf😆
1.1 million views in 23 hours , shows how big the ppv is gonna be
I LOVE NATE DIAZ!!!  Don't be surprised mutha fuka's!!! Diaz deserves the best they can throw at him. He's gonna shock the world again.
"You do the steroids I'll smoke weed then let's get in there" 😆💪
One word “CRINGE”
Got respect for Diaz but he is no Champion. He is just good at taking a beating until someone gets tired.
Am I the only 1 who can't hear what Nate says?😅
The casuals says Nate is a Champ, all the HardCore Fans Say Nate needs to win a fight this Decade!
Poor guy he's got chronic traumatic encephalopathy, he needs help  not another fight !!!
15 years in the top 10 fighting all kinds of legends. Thats whats up.
I love nate but i really hope he goes on to better things. Hes the funnest fighter to watch, but the damage hes been through is crazy and the ufc never cared. He deserved better.
Let's go Nate!! 🔥 the real BMF!
Nate is an absolute legend. He has given fans and fighters in MMA/UFC great fights since the beginning.
If you think about it, Nate almost won against Leon - a shot in the last round that wobbled him bad. Then Leon faces Kamaru and wins from a shot in the last round in a fight he was losing to become the champ. Nate always puts on a show no matter who he fights.
Its gona be another one of them " im not suprised motherfuckers" moments
interview nate and have censorship??never gonna work like that bos
This is one of the best interviews I've seen with nate, its hard to get a in depth conversation with him or nick
9:49 I died 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nate is true warrior🥊🥊❤️..hope nate outclassed all 5 round with khamzat all slapp on the face..
Nate a real legend , from being the greatest of students to to jus a straight up warrior ,don’t never duck no smoke or bite his tongue n will get it craccn on sight salute ✊🏾who really put on for Stockton like the Diaz bros u feel me they up there w the best of em from Stockton !
I just noticed Mike Tyson n Nate sounds kindda same ....
Nate \NO QUIT/ Diaz 3rd  wins
I hate this interviewer. He’s so boring
Adam Sandler is massive yeah but when he put him along with De Niro, Pacino and Di Caprio I lost it hahahahaha
this man is goin to win..
I only pray that when Nate retires for good and HOLLYWOOD starts putting together the “life of Nick and Nate”Movie…the UFC better take care of one of one of if not THEE greatest UFC entertainers of ALL time. Him and NICK! Especially when the real CTE sits in… they better be there for him for the rest of his life…
Ariel is way better at interviewing.
did he just cry?
This was a very vintage Tyson-esque interview
lets go champ
I want Diaz to win but let’s be real he’s gonna he viciously tkod
This interview has the feel of a psych eval.  I feel like homie is trying to plant seeds in Nate's head....but Nate shrugs him off.  Seriously pulling for Diaz in this one.  This is not a man to underestimate.
Says a lot that the Khamzat interview has been out for longer but has nearly half of the views this has.
Nate and Nick for life...
I want Nate to win and really mess up the UFC's plans.
waiting for the next video
Nate should be in the next Warrior movie if they make one. One of the most Gangster dudes in UFC, only one to step to Connor McGregor on short notice 😱 and win
This guy has killer mentality.. kill or be killed
Think about this, win or loose Nate takes off one glove and puts in in the middle of the octagon and calls for a one fight contract against Connor. Come on now.
“You take steroids and ill smoke weed and lets get into the octagon” 😂
Brett, you stand up when you shake someone's hand
The way Nate left was crazy a Diaz exit of I ever saw one
Bro…..Diaz is the fukn man.
He knows he’s getting broke off hard.
"This was a great interview Brad, I have to go"  *interview over*
Took about 10 min to get him rolling but once he did I loved it..
ToKiR 47 GAMING Subscribe Karo
ToKiR 47 GAMING
This guy is usually pretty stupid but ro say Charles Oliveira ain't the real deal is to completely be delusional.
This is why ufc should pay their fighters more .. the damage is done
Nate Diaz has now become the gatekeeper..but khamzat better be careful he couldn't enter the gate without going through hell..I'm sure about that,💪💪💪
9:49
Real top G. Praying he shakes up the world 🌎
Mr Diaz; let me give you your wake up call; you're hanging around too many no good b******start training stay away from those unwelcome want to be around you for your money and fame you don't need those kind of people Nate I'm talking to you like I would be talking to one of my brothers you don't need those kind of people that are around you and you're not a hoodlum you're not a gang banger you're not a gang member you are Nate Diaz Nate Diaz The fighter bring yourself out of what little circle you're in step out of there start training so you could be the fighter used to be I see you now; and I remember the fighter you used to be that's right Nate you used to be a good fighter; make your brother proud of you be the brother he deserves start training let go of what you're doing and we both know what we're talking about let go of the trash!
I’m looking forward to this fight. As much as the McGregor fights. If not more. If we get to see a Stockton slap and some middle fingers that’ll be icing on the cake.
32:28 “what n***a? That’s how you do this, what’s up?”😂
"this was a great interview, I have to go".
How do you choose your beliefs, dreams, desires, or even favorite color?? 🔴🟥
Nate beat Leon (even though he lost 'officially), Leon Beat Usman. That means Nate beat Usman and Nate is the champion.
DIAZ ARMY HAS ARRIVED 🫡 WE ARE WITH YOU WIN LOSS OR DRAW
Rock this dude big Nate!
this was a great interview I've got to go!!!   lmfao hahahah
Sorry Nate sorry Nate you're not the fighter you used to be I would like to see you away sober night Nate sorry Nate!
1.1 million views
Nate: "...you know what I'm saying?" Me: "I don't, sorry."
🔥
Nate wins TKO 4th round
Let’s go Nate!  Realest in the game
LETS GO
Nate should never do interviews. This is painful to watch
Team Nate!!  In all faith you are gonna come out on top!! One thing I think I noticed. A little scar tissue removed.
Much respect to Nate and Nick.  Never under estimate the Diaz brothers.
WHAT AN INTERVIEW!
I feel Nate gonna Win this one for sure 🔥❤️🙏🏼 and rematch Leon and getting the title in 2023 🎉 Let’s Go Nate 💯
24:10 The best part :)
That was the fight Nate vs Ferguson
Very hard to watch this …..
Let's not kid ourselves, this poor sod is going to have his head caved in. He's incoherent, he's punch drunk. Yeah he'll make some money but what is it if you have no brain. Evidence of madness? He wanted to fight Ngannou! feel really sad for this guy
Let’s goooo Nate
How can you not fear the heart of Nate Diaz. I hope he gets a walk off KO
I got Nate by Submission, Chock em out NATE💪🦁
Even tho he is delusional nate.. I still hope you beat khamzat, just to prove the nay sayers
This is a win win for Diaz. Everyone expects him to lose so it’s not a big deal. And if he pulls it off, he shocks the world once again. I wouldn’t be surprised, motherfuckers.
🔥🔥🔥
Love how he keeps it real. UFC ain’t gettin rid of Nate diaz that’s a fact
Nates crazy. Artem Lobov is the best fighter to ever live.
Why should we strain our ears
Nate Diaz's smarter than most of the fighters. He knows the fight game he lives the fight game. That's why the Real Inc is gonna succeed and that's why he's interviews are the best!
Man I love the guy but they should be using this interview as a reason to not smoke pot.
Why is he look like he about cry
Tupac of MMA
Diaz is too old
I will miss him in UFC. Let's go Nate. Love you
Let’s be honest, I love Diaz but he’s hard to follow when he talks. All these comments on here talking like they know what he’s saying lol
Boy that Nate is a brilliant conversationalist.  A true wordsmith.
The goat
Nate speaks the truth, he’s never stopped, he’s just REAL, not like your TJ dillashaws. These guys don’t cheat, they put the hard work in, and have beat nothing but TOP notch competition. He’s not like some fighters looking to pad their stats to get a title shot. I truly hope he works this boy over, the UFC is really trying hard to make another Nurmagomedov, he might be a good fighter, but I agree, make this man fight some real completion before u put him In there against a UFC legend.
He’s going to get his teeth knocked out.
Nate touches  upon something here , Dana is clearly simping for the Islamic demograph , fighting in Saudi , overhyping a bunch of wrestling farmers etc , chase that sheckel Dana ...but when the oil runs out , you will be invested in a desert.
Wish his last fight was another 5 round war with Conor. Much better matchup. Just going to be a rough night for Diaz fans. That being said, I hope he shocks the world. Real fighters always have a chance.
This is just my halftime show! Always in his own zone. Let’s go! War Diaz!
this dude is boring interviewer
props to this interviewer
This is just the Half Time Show!
I don’t think I have ever liked Nate more than I do right now, win or lose he is the realest to ever take the octagon
Nate is the truth
Kamaru Usman impersonation was great lol! :D
No matter Win or loose… matter only Best.. Best is always..! Mr Nate Diaz☝️☝️🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩ever
Can we reach 2 million views before the fight ,?
Nate has a lil Robert Denero (or ever how you spell it 😂), when he's got that smirk on his face. It seems like a long shot,but if anyone can do it,well wouldn't doubt a Diaz
Never seen Nate going so deep on so many different subjects and being so at ease. This was cool AF.  Having to listen to Stephen A's annoying voice after 30 mins of Nate was tough though. Be mindful espn. Please.
Nick n Nate always been my favorite fighters
I know Nate don’t give a f*** but I really hope he’s training for this fight. Striking defense, head movement, and striking power.
I knew it. Nate never wanted Khamzat. This is a set up. The worst match up in UFC history. And we could've had him vs. Tony 🤦‍♂️
I like nate but that's some hard cope
kids dont do drugs
When people speak like Nate then u know they been fighting forever
Nate is true goat
Nate showed me from a young age that the numbers don't matter. The respect you have for yourself matters more than any ranking the machine puts out. When you respect yourself and you will only fight those at the top of their game even if you lose you are still at the top. The ones you fight win or lose is what creates your legacy. Nate has only ever fought the best. I believe he learned from the way his brother was treated that he was not gonna play thr game that was expected. He was gonna phuq with the machine harder than the way they phuqed with Nick. Thank you Nate and Thank you Nick for the wars you fought and the way you presented yourselves. You both are what true warriors and deserve way more than what you received. However, I am sure the way the rest of the world measures success isn't even an issue to you both. Even though you will be far more successful than the world could ever imagine. GOD BLESS YOU BOTH 🙏 ❤️ 👊
Legend
Nate call me I want to party with you.
Nate you're delusional buddy. Uv lost half of your fights. You're very far from the best ever in the ufc. These fans need to stop gassing him up.. he's washed up and throws paddy cake punches. He couldn't accidentally knock someone out, just like gaitche
whats up with the video quality is it trash or just me
Guy likes weed as we know he has to meet Mike tyson maybe it was cheap he gave him this smoking equipment
This video is trending number one. We’re gonna miss you, Nate.
FIX YOUR AUDIO ESPN MMA... pathetic
Am I the only person who doesn’t want Nate to keep fighting?  He’s done enough.  He should be laying back chillin or coaching the next generation. This fight makes no sense. I won’t pay for it. Respect both guys but I hate this fight. Rather see Nate and Tony fight. Let Leech try to get some respect back from Khamzat
I’m not surprised motherfu$kers
Love him or hate him, take in as much Nate as you can. He is a lager than life Character that cannot be replicated.
I'm not surprised motherfuckers
this is why you should stay in school kids. There's life beyond middle school 🤣
Everyone who reads this, we dont know eachother & probably never will but i wish you all the best in life and all the luck in the world. 🖤
This guy sucks at interviews no personality at all doesn’t make them feel comfortable.
Let's go Nate
I refuse to be lame.
Brett is good at interviewing people.
Nate goes on a 30min rant "This was a great interview" -nate  Lmao it was awesome I just thought that was funnt
32:36 - 33:00 hahahahah = and that , ladies and gentlemen , is why we love Nate motherfucking Diaz ~
I've been keeping up with the Diaz bros. Since ufc started  all I can say is real isn't always nice but always necessary 💯 per cent respect for him he's been abused in ufc imo many have
I'm rootin for Nate and Tony on dis card 💯
1 day, million views. Says it all.
WAR DIAZ ALL DAY
The only fighter in the world who started and did the interview by himself and ended the interview by himself. Gotta love him!
Who cares? Dudes got 13 losses on his record. Trash fighter
Roller coaster of emotions,happy & sad for Nate all in the same time,he’s frustrated he never got the proper respect he deserved & never been champion n now there feeding him to the lions
Brett genuinely has no idea what Nate is saying 😂😂
diaz stealing the show, as usual
cte+massive amounts of weed is a helluva drug
“You do steroid’s, I’ll smoke weed and let’s get in there and squab.” -Nate Diaz 🤣🤣
Based on the beggy comments, might just be me that didn't understand a word this mother fudger said. He literally rambled like a drunk.
I love how they went straight to the interview.
feels like he is mentally broken. i wish he could win. because he is such a persona. but im afraid he will suffer a big big punishment. i hope to be wrong
Nick & Nate are warriors real gladiators of the fight game. Nate is the people's champion. Nate is going too pull it off again as he always does. He will catch that chin and Stockton slap. And it's on. Love the Diaz brother's. Nate fir the win! Go get it Nate! Diaz army baby!
Why does nate sniff his fingers like doofey
Unbreakable spirit.
720p Jesus man.
I cant wait
It Was a great interview Brett!
He’s the best!!!!😂😂😂,,, NDA motherfuckers!!!!!,,, let’s go Nate!!!
Broo his Kamaru impresion was 👌👌"I'm the maaan" 😂😂
Bin a fan of the diaz  brothers from when it was just nick.....UFC clearly doing him dirty. Not a kumshot fan so I would love for nate to stick it to them and  turn their fighter back.
I see him and his bro about once every 2 3 years at the local liquor store I always show them huge respect. Don't even ask him for Pictures because I have a conversation and live in the moment.
The army is here and will always be here Nate
What an insightful, heartfelt and well spoken interview
Let's go Nate♨️🤟🥋
Number 1 trending is insane
Out of principle I don't watch Brett or ESPN MMA but for a Nate Diaz interview I'll set my principles aside.
ESPN is interviewing Nate Diaz but still decides they'll mute a bunch of F words. I don't know those who took that decision but it's horseshit. Did you just learn about the guy you were coming to interview?
NATE N CONOR  R REAL DEAL
1 trending?
It should’ve been Tony vs Nate man
Lol Nate, he'll fight someone on PEDs and he'll be high. That's fair. Love Nate
MR GOAT 🐐 MAKE A GOAT.      🇺🇸 🇲🇽
Nate will loose  No chance  Everybody knows
Nate has a lot of fans behind him. Man’s a true-life brawler and not many others can lay claim to this. I hope he goes out on a high note and keeps his focus for this one. Win or lose, he’s the man!!
The thing about Nick and Nate is they honestly don't give a s*** who they fight or where they're fighting or any of that stuff but they particularly really don't like to fight as well so there's an irony there don't throw down anytime but they don't like to throw down but I guess when you really think of it who really wants to fight and likes to fight people that say that I don't believe that myself when I was younger I didn't mind getting in fights but I didn't like to fight I'm into somebody provoked me you got to defend yourself but you actually go out there for the sake of fighting nah with this guy right here Nate and Nick definitely Legends of the Sport and work to be where they're at and the people's minds and hearts Nate just started on the ultimate fire series now look where he's at, walking Legend future Hall of Famer
Hopefully Nate can pull this off. Lots of upsets lately this is the fight game. Anything can happen
If there were no time limits Nate would win almost every fight and most people can't say that
Did you record this on a potato? It's 2022...
Is crazy the numbers Diaz pulls
What's up with the set up of this interview feels like Brett's trying to seduce Nate
Kinda crazy knowing this could be the last Nate Diaz UFC fight week
Another legend that should not fight anymore. The brain damages are pretty obvious to me. There is a speech impediment or he's on drugs or both.
Respect Nate . Only interview I'd even consider watching , the man got true heart .
Nate will shock the world. He's fighting someone that is all hype.
Nate's CTE is so bad that he don't realize there's a flip phone on a tri-pod filming him.
"this was a great interview Brett I have to go" lol
Rooting for Nate. California.
I knew Dana was lying acting like he wasn’t sending Nate out and saying Nate asked for this fight
🤣After watching this I had no choice but to come to the comment section🔥🔥🔥 Interview. Nate don't give a F**k.
Nate should do his own podcast would be a good opportunity for him to in gage with his fans seems so he has a lot 👊
Khamzat had major hype before this fight was even announced.
I just don't see how he can beat chimaev but I didn't think he could beat connor
if this is only audio, I would say its mike tyson
Nate is one of those fighters that has extremely loyal fans. Win or Lose. Nate has my respect.
Let's go
If Nate makes you feel uncomfortable you've been stuck in a fake mind set! 2 Real! Let's get it Nate!
Hahahah
"know what I'm sayin'"  "uh-huh"  : I
People sleeping on Nate he is a real fighter in life and sport saludos Nate you will win
Don't know why but I just can not tolerate okamoto. Freaking unbearable.
16:27
209 4ever💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Nate reminds me of Mike Tyson when he talks!!!
The entitlement of this guy is insane and the delusion on top of that
I love Nate!
Lmfao  Nate just talking the whole time.  “this was a great interview Bret I have to go”  I LOVE YOU NATE!!!
is it just me or is Nate starting to look and sound like white Mike Tyson?
Any comment from people from Dubai?
If khamzat doesnt put on a show and destroy diaz its a win for diaz. i feel like its gonna be a war
Nate with a Submission over Khamzat.
Honestly, idk how this man is still alive.
I understand exactly what he thinks an is saying!
Greatest Gangster of all time. Much Love and Respect Homie Nate. Nick Diaz Army Mother Fuckers!!!!!!😎😎
#1 trending🫡 NDA ten toes behind Nate
Whos are best 5 p4p . Him , israel ,volk , haha il fight all of them in 5 seconds😂😂True G Legend
how they still got videos in 720p in late 2022? comeon lets get some high def pictures here ESPN!
Nate is the goat and anybody out there thinking nate is gonna get run over Saturday y’all trippen won’t be surprised if he wins by tko
Yall couldn't of made the volume a lil higher? 🙄
Is he retarted
Let’s go Nate!
I love Nate, but he’s talking crazy saying he doesn’t even know who Usman fought. 😂😂😂😂
Diaz has such a great character, no one is like them.
Respect Nate diaz period this guy put so much on the line from start...its so lame how ufc treat him 🤦
These just don’t hit the same when it’s not Ariel doing the interviewing. Whatever bothers / annoys y’all so much to not like him  even his biggest hater can’t deny that. His ability to read & converse with Nathan is unmatched because both respect & trust each other from years of doing so.   Get Brett’s ESPNs best option & like him but he’s trying to live up to something you can’t recreate or force lol
That is the realest mo fucka ever ..............ever
Nate is one of a kind! "I refuse to be lame" what a line to end it on! Good luck saturday Nate 👊
They should have picked Ariel for this interview, Brett is wack
this' been a great interview brett, I have to go! hahahaha
Let's go chimaev
Scared and very very stupid.
Another « i’m not suprised motherfuckers » would be awsome!!!
Beep beep beep beep beep beep😂
UFC legend Nate Diaz will remain ❤️
There is a lot of resentment towards the ufc and rightfully so both his brother and him got held back at one point or another
NICK DIAZ ARMY MO FO
So happy he said Fedor 👑
ESPN interviews sux,  I wanna hear the bleeps
Nate Diaz is always the underdog!!! Win or loose he’s the reason everyone is going to be watching.
Would love for Dana to watch and comment on this!
Love nate ...sad they did  him dirty....
So long, Nathan!🖐
Just doing it for the homies.
#1 on trending!!! nate bigger than the sport
Legend
hardworking is the key of success
46 464644
Can’t wait to hear him tell Joe iam not surprised motherfucker
dfrey r
Nate is a legend .
I hope Nate gets this win. No way I miss this fight though, some are just to big in the history of the sport to miss
This guy has been punched in the head too many times. Half of his sentences make no sense.
This may be Nate Diaz's last fight in UFC. Just hoping that he doesn't get completely mauled by Khamzat.
Legend!
He has that scar tissue above his eye that’s going to pop with one shot
My guy wanna see him go out with a W
Nate and Nick should either be permanent coaches or make their own Tuf like competition show. Get paid, grow the game, and their legends become even greater
Nate seems more punch drunk that ever.
Rooting for Nate always his name has brought so much attention to the ufc Dana White can suck sum man Frfr better pay this man win lose injury anything Nate Diaz makes money
Nate is right about Jon Jones, if you're someone who got caught taking steroids you aren't even in the discussion about being the GOAT. Atleast not amongst the real clean fighters who put in there hard work with no help from Performance Enhancement Drugs. Jon Jones can keep his undefeated cheated record, the only legacy he will be remembered for is being the Ultimate Fighting Cheating Champion. That's the one and only title nobody can ever take away from him.
Best interview ever!!!!
Nate just ended it. Lol 🤣 that's my dawg
For all people saying or even thinking nate wins are on something🤣
Get em Nate! I got money on you!
I eat gansters for breakfast : khamzat chimaev
He just want to fight top contenders, the real deal guys from what I see here So why wasn't it given to him ?  (I never watched Nate, when he was big my country was no internet)
What did he say ?
I love these type of interviews. I never really knew what type of guy Nate truly was. I just knew him as a guy whos always ten toes down. This interview gave me a clear idea of his mindset and it makes me understand Nate so much more. Nates an OG for sure
Your cool but your time has long gone.
wow if tthis doesnt show brain damage, I dont know what does. He's half there, basically brain dead.
16:10 so the fighters and the media and the fighters who are saying "oh you know what I'm saying? Got it.
Win or lose the respect remains the same 👍👍👍....Nate Diaz is the big deal 🥊🥊🥊
UFC won't be the same if Diaz retires.....
Man this interview was great! I don’t see Nate winning Khamzat doesn’t get tired but man one can hope !
Your to old bro,
ESPN can't afford a 1080p camera?
Rooting for Nate - would be a great upset... But anyone else think he beat Leon or is it just Nate??
Did Diaz fart @ 1:56
As a fighter I was made by my brother 💯 Diaz brothers 🇲🇽🇺🇸Nick is my favorite fighter to.
NAAAATE DIIIIAAAAAAAZZZZ
the goat
Love Nate !   He got them Mike Tyson qualities to him
8:35 what did he say here?
I love the Diaz brothers but I still don't see why they think they can call every shot they want. Both of their records are decent at best lol
Absolutely love this dude 💯💯
It’s the Nick Diaz army motherfuckers!
Rest in peace brother
whats with the bad quality
Mr 209,let's goo.
“If your Mr. Goat, make a Goat”
“The high moments you expect the low moments, the low moments you expect the high moments” he’s got life figured out, I hope he shocks the world again as much as Khamzat is a beast 🔥
Did he just say he was the greatest fighter to ever step into the UFC octagon? He's trolling right? 🤣😂
Go Nate!
Love his respect for the past champs but his view is cloudy if he doesn't think those same guys he looked up to didn't do the same thing these modern champs are. And there's guy more active that have been there longer. Love Nate but his blinded by this everyone is against me thing. Not saying he hasn't been done wrong at times but holding onto that anger won't do him any good long-term. And finally Leon worked you Nate, easiest fight? Really... you landed 1 punch after he literally worked you over for 4 and a half rounds without any answers. Still wish you the best
Did ESPN film this with a iPod Nano or something?
Team Diaz!! Ruin their plans bro! 🔥 💪
Hi, i wanna get reply...
I’m definitely not saying that.  I believe Nate has a Chance to Shock the World once again beating the best thing in Conor
Nates face will look like a bowl of spaghetti after this fight
29:00 let me pants on lmao
I love Nate but he was in a position to fight for a title and he lost in multiple number one contender fights you win those fights you get a shot at the title and you fought Benson Henderson and lost so you can't say that you weren't in a position for a title
Win or win we got Nate!!💯
Nate’s impression of Kamaru was amazing
#1 on trending. Nate is king
To ask for contracts for 10 guys or you won't resign? That's just you NOT wanting to resign at all. I love Nate but c'mon that is just a little too much. You asking for the UFC to take your word on 10 guys that maybe just maybe 3 or 4 off them will make a little impact. Other than that if the money was as good as he pretends it was then you actually don't wanna stay with the company which is cool but why make your 10 guys an excuse for you NOT resigning with the company. Lame excuse but I will respected because it has to be more than your 10 friends that you want sign into the UFC
Diaz brothers are GOATS's in the game
Nate Diaz legend 🔥❤️💋
Bret always does good at letting the interview go with the flow. He's not a robot stuck on a script. He did it with Nick Diaz before Lawler. He lets guys talk and asks questions to keep them talking. I enjoy watching him interview guys especially the ones like the Diaz brothers who are more difficult to get to open up.
This has gotta be the best interview
I ain't surprised m******
Idk who this interviewer is, but he needs to go back to interview school
I cant wait for Nate to say...Hey Im not surprised motherfuckers
Let's go Nate, big greetings and support from Europe, Slovenia is rooting for you, let's go STOCKTON SLAP
I'm a Khamzat fan but I want Nate to win this one he needs to go out with a W
Man it’s hard to see the damage pile up on these guys. True Ganster of the sport
Total respect for Nate but I think for his health it’s time to wrap it up. This was painful to listen to. Cognitive issues.
31:45 bro i love nate but  the stutter had me dead😭😭
This crybaby still mad over tweets?
this man should not be allowed to fight... his brain is clearly mush
Trotz Kanalsperre YouTube 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
what wrong with nate the way he talking is smth wrong i mean not normal '(
Jake get messages?
Live khazmat but praying nate wins he funking deserves it . True warrior
For God so loved the world, That He have His only begotten son, so that whosoever believes in Him would be saved. (John 3:16, Bible). We have all broken God’s moral law and have gotten the death penalty. However, Jesus lived a perfect life in order to take our place and endure the wrath of God. He did this because He loves us so much! Repent from sin and trust in what Jesus did for you so your sins can be forgiven and forgotten. <3
How can you not love this dude..💯  Put sum RESPEKK on his name! 👊🏼
💯 Nate is #1 for me 🇲🇽
If America (USA) had a monarchy, Nate Diaz would get the crown 👑
Nate you are the realest OG fighter of all times. When we see you in the streets we bow down for you and your brother homes. Nobody had the „just don’t give a f**k“ attitude you had.  From all my heart i wish you f**k up Khamzat or make him look bad and all the UFC‘s plans with him.
Nate drops a interview and hits 1 mill in 1 night. Win or lose nate is a hall of famer and if nate wins that would be the most diaz thing you could do
Leon would’ve destroyed Nate in a street fight. He already destroyed him in a cage fight.
If Nate wins “I’m not surprised mofo II” will be epic 🤣
Put down 5K on Diaz. He’s gonna shock the world one last time before he leaves the UFC
Nah this was a great interview! I gotta go 🤣
CTE bad
All you need to know about Nate Diaz as a person is the fact that, by his story here, he refused a new UFC contract based solely on the fact that the company refused to sign his team.   Wether or not they deserved it, that’s the kind of friend you want
Still a legend of the sport.
This the interview of the year already 🔥
Can’t wait for this fight man, OG vs New blood
I don’t think he’s mentally well enough to fight…
Im not sure he needs to take another punch, and I'm a fan.
It saddens me already to see how his brain will be functioning 5 years from now
🙏🏼You got this homie!👍🏼💪🏼
🤣🤣🤣 the best part was the end when Nate ended the interview all abruptly lololololololol this was a great interview I have to go
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Nate said a lot bro. He been keeping it real. Nate my goat for sure bro. Inspired me to get fit .
This camera guy ain't never heard of zoomin out
30 minutes well spent. Nate is cooler then the other side of the pillow.
interviewer: Jon Jones? Nate: Who?
Nate finishes the sentence and says: This was a great interview, Brett. I gotta go now. 😎😂💪🏼
Will buy everyone here a beer if nate ever says this dudes full name properly lol
Dude I love nate diaz.
I refuse to be lame 😎
This is the most sense nate has made in an interview in years
I would recognize a famous fighter over any actor, and be way more happy to meet them. 🙏
And that's how you finish an interview.
This dudes not cool dope respectable or commendable he's actually very unprofessional and is definitely on the spectrum.
Nate has taken a lot of headshots
Nate diaz starting to sound like Joe Biden... 🙃
Keeping it real
Nate wins, will he sign another ufc contract for a possible Diaz Edward's 2... Nate with the belt would be epic
دب
Kudos to Brett for letting Nate go for a few minutes, allowing Nate to process his thoughts and words. And Nate does a pretty good Karamu Usman impression 😂😂😂
etewt4 w4
etewt4 w4
no joke i think Nate is what you get when you have a mildly autistic boy that grows up in the gutter instead of in the middle class (where you get the angry weebs)
N8 the gr8
I hope Nate pulls off the biggest upset in UFC history. Everybody’s saying he’s gunna get destroyed. Put some respect on that man’s name.
smoke the weed
Nate is going to upset the ufc & a lot of fans if he doesn't get cut up & the doctor stops the fight but the diaz bros get cut up a lot I like khamzat but the longer the fight goes on the more chance nate has of winning the fight
Let's go nate
Man we're gonna miss him sooo much .Not gonna miss a second of this fight
Nate’s strategy will always be eating punches  for 3 -4 rounds to tire opponent out … khamzat needs to slow down and not try to finish Nate , whose chin is just uncrackable
What a legend of a fighter. Ultimate respect to him.
Jesu Nates brain  is damaged so baad during these years. He is like on drugs
He talks exactly like my 5years old Nephew ...!!
Most genuine real person you’ll ever meet
The true people's champion.
Soo much respect for Nate 🙏💯
This is a " Bomb Dropping" interview: Diaz summed up what the UFC is all about, w/ the "shared" Cherry Picking of fights by the Fighters & Management, dismissing Khamzat beating Burns, which underscores an overlooked point: if Khamzat doesn't exhibit better FIGHT IQ than he did vs GB, he's   in short & long - term trouble... called out Usman, which was very interesting, & in an offhand way, gave a man he fought, Leon Edwards respect in doing so Wasn't a huge Diaz fan prior to this chat, but I give anyone respect for speaking their mind & telling it like it REALLY IS in doing so...
People say this fight is the worst for nate but what about khamzat? If he loses he is effed and if he wins it does nothing for him
Tito vs Nate in Scrabble tournament perhaps?
Love hm wish over 15 years he progressed in fighting as much talking
Love you Nate as fighter and human, feel bit emotionally maybe cos UFC had never apprieaceited you as one of the best ones 😉 good luck on saturday nite - 1,2 should be receipt
Liked Nick back in the days so i was on the nate hype but the guy is just delusional.  "Im the best fighter in the UFC" "Get me Nganou" ... Come on man, that's just bad marketing for marejuana.
This man literally has an army around and behind him. Straight respect!!!!!! Let's go Diaz!!!!!!
It’s crazy how Nate gets more coverage and publicity than Alex Volkanoski
The way he took off at the end of the interview 😂😂😂😂
Every single big fighter that comes to the end of their UFC contract leaves salty and broken. What does this tell you about how UFC does business ? And how they really treat their fighters?
Nate 💪💯💥
It is true about the steroids. Being kicked by a dude on steroids hurts more than a non roided up. For sure.  JJ is not and cannot be a goat. At least you have to beat USADA.
Nate diaz most hardest chin in ufc history
“ if you’re Mr. goat then make a goat“ -Nate Diaz
Nate is a G, and I have been a fan of him and his brother for a long time, but I really don’t like this matchup for his last fight. Would be incredible to see him shock the world though.
32:12
Interviewer didn't learn to stand up and shake hands?
Camera man got a workout filming this lol
Nate said nganou 🤣 I’m dead
Hi, i wanna get reply...
I sense that this main event will end in an early stoppage. Khamzat is going to win and there will be controversy for the next six months.
Nate vs Mayweather Come on! Don't worry, Nate, you are my G.O.A.T.
Speaking his truth.  He sees reality
Nate if you want to win the fight you have to adjust your speed.if not i think your chances to win is very2 small
Rooting for Diaz 👊 destroy chimayev, man. Much respect from Tatarstan, Russia 💪
Brain damage much?..
He fought burns dawg burns 🤣
Why are you doing it?  Lol for the $ of course.  Stupid question.
Betting on Diaz it's 8x the money if he wins.
nate just want to fight anybody
Thats why u cant believe anything Uncle Dana Says..  "I mean he said he wanted Frances" thats when your words get used against you..
Can you imagine you walk into a gas station and BAM, its leo dicaprio on one side of the store and on the other side is Fedor haha i have to agree i would probably have to go walk over to the side that has fedor to see whats up
It’s bad when Khamzat speaks English more clearly than Nate! 😂😂🤦‍♂️😂😂😂
Anything can happen in the octagon there’s no guarantees and I’m standing by this dude win or lose
All the same,it's War.
nate vs charlie zelenoff next
He has a hard time explaining himself or he's just hard to understand sometimes. I get what he saying somewhat at the end but during I'm lost sometimes then I got to piece together what he's trying to say
A true warrior deserves respect. Let's go Nate!!
…this is a 33 minute advertisement to show why you shouldn’t get hit in the head for a living.
I’m not surprised muthafuckers.
Nate Diaz vocabulary gibberish
"if u think u Mr. Goat then make a goat".
I don’t watch much of Nate Diaz but has he always sounded like this? Sounds like he’s high or under some influence? Great interview tho !!
If there is moment in time where underdog had to win, this is it. Come on Karma do your thing, make the magic moment!!!!
Hes actually got a solid point
It's 2022 and ESPN is still uploading 720P potato quality videos ~ that said I hope Nate submits Gourmet Chenche ~
War Diaz!!!!
Nate has a great outlook on fighting
TELL ME NATE AINT THE GOAT!?!! 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Nate looks visibly upset that it’s his last fight with the UFC. It’s crazy to see him looking old I remember watching him on the ultimate fighter!
I like Nate as a fighter...but when he talks, it's almost impossible to understand what he is saying. Even the YouTube robot that makes the subtitles quit its job.
The delusion on this guy is real. 1 win in 6 years cominn up 7. Just be quite and be humble on your way out.
I would love love love to see Nate and McGregor fight that would be awesome Nate deserves 👙night
Great Interview. Can’t wait for this fight but 720p quality guys ? poor audio and you censor out Nate’s profanity 🤯
Nate has caracter,he is old school top dog👏Allways my prefered fighter💪
Lost his sight to reality…
i got autism watching this, but diazarmy for life
33:28 *N* word 😂😂😂
Calm down people,this isn't the greatest fight of Nate.The 2-0 vs Conor were his greatest fights.
“This is just my halftime show.. I’m just gettin started” LFG Nate
I love how he keeps it real and simple no matter the set up they try to give and narrative their trying to push
Straight up ghee
Thanks Nate ! I remember Chuck liddell was supposed to destroy  Randy Couture..an the young bull got humbled by the goat...let's go Nate
Why do I feel like Mike Tyson and Nate Diaz talk alike . I would love to see Mike interviewing Nate .
30:21  😂😂😂Nate almost beat up Dana white in s club
Another iconic Nate Diaz interview to remember for years to come .🫡
I agree with Nate. F y’all fools as mother Fera
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Adesanya or Ngannou give me anybody hahahahaha this man isnt afraid of nothing thats for sure 😂
I wish the ufc didn’t have time limits or rounds just start an fight until someone is finished Nate’s record would be a lot better I guarantee u that
Who is the two people you would love to hang out with for the day?   For me :   Mike Tyson  Nate Diaz
God I hope Nate pulls it off. 🙏🏽
ufcs mike tyson
This dude is getting dummer and dummer he things he is the best what a joke
Love Nate, hes the peoples champion. PRAYING FOR A GOOD RESULT FOR YOU BUDDY.
LFG
Gotta love Nate, the real gangsta in this upcoming fight, he,ll leave cumshot with a fight that will be in his mind for a long time
I’ll fight the entire top 5 P4P in 5 secs with all due respect -Nate Diaz
LETS GO NATE
Terrible audio
And I understood but also I didn’t understand but now I really understand. -Nate Diaz
Let’s go big dawg you got this Nate👌🏽
Dude the Diaz interviews are always so hard to follow lol  I do think the UFC is doing him Dirty AF
I cant find any reason to hate Nate. Guy super real.
I hope Nate shocks the world 🙏🏽🙌🏽
Narrative is the word you are looking for.
I heard chick Norris got Diaz Army tattooed on his chest
Just glad Ariel didn't do interview 10 push ups John
Needs subtitles
The realest
I love Nate lol. Half the time he doesn't make sense but sometimes I'm like yea he has a great point. Lmao
My heart hurts seeing him. He's so strong. I hope he's always happy and healthy. It's tiring for him.
Camera man had his work cut out for him on this one
I want nate to win this fight and then I want the ufc to offer him a huge money 1 fight contract for a rematch with leon Edward's for the title. And I want nate to win that fight and become champion. Calling it now!
Love this guy , don't wanna see him getting hurt.
I've just rewatched breaking bad and i just can't not hear Walter junior
Nate is gonna lose to a doctor stoppage like the masvidal fight you heard it here
Let’s go Nate
I don't want bad stuff to happen to this guy. I feel sad for him. Hope he'll come out okay.
Come on Nate LET'S-FUCKING-GOOOOOO! even after hes smacked around some the best of the best, people are still counting him out.... we shall see...
Mighty Mouse is the GOAT
10:18. Straight up.
Love and respect Nate. The peoples champ
I love Diaz but I am real afraid about his mental health in the future :(
Let's go Nate!! Win or lose team Diaz!
Nate forever will be my favourite mma fighter of all time, they pushed this fight to try and finish his career on a loss, Khamzat is legit but we’ve seen Nate shock the world before, this is not the fight they should have made, Conor 3 made more sense both at the end of their careers and a settlement fight! LETS GO DIAZ!!
nigganou?
I wouldn't be surprised motherfuckers
Nate been a real warrior for the sport. Where other guys look for gimmicks like Colby, Jorge, usman, and many others. Just be a fighter like nate
Nobody pulls up this kind of views besides conor
I've been watching UFC 2 back in the 90s!! His brother a legend and now him. For two brothers to come in and change this game, so much will always be respected.always appreciated by true fans and fighters.🤜🤜  You've got one more my boi!! Get this dub and ride out!!!
Nate take this guy out into deep water and show everyone who can die to win
"Put some respect" on this man's name! He deserves it more than anyone in the ufc today.
Ayo major mike tyson vibes
Video quality is garbage for a company like ESPN. Recorded on a flip phone?
Diaz bros and Tate bros 🔥🔥
The best interview I have ever seen. He is speaking his heart out & isn't scared of the company. Shout out to Brett for not interruption the champ. Let's go Nate. Let's shock the world again
….genuine, well mannered and perfect ambassador for the sport. Great fan of yours from Canada.
Go Nate! Way more real than masvidal.
A nearly bald Nate Diaz Is a Dangerous Nate Diaz 👨‍🦲☝
There's two people in a room.  Nate Diaz and anyone else in the world you can think of.  Nate Diaz is the real one.
I understood about 20% of what Nate Diaz was saying and I still watched the entire interview.
I’d love to hear “I’m not surprised mu….” One. More. Time
Colby fights the winner
Hot Take. I think one of the only things that would ease the Diaz bros minds and really help them truly find happiness is a good education. Imagine these guy’s being able to really express themselves verbally without feeling flustered it’s sucks when you’re trying make a point and not being able to to put it into words. It’s frustrating and can make you feel lesser in some degree. I’m not saying they are, both have way more money that I will ever have, an are brilliant fighters and have street smarts no doubt.
33:27 This is the Nate Diaz version of Mike Tyson's "You've got to go now" wrapping up of an interview.
if you're from Stockton you can hear the Stockton in Nate.
The one and only  "G"GOAT!!!!!
I can't tell if he's punch drunk anymore or if he has always sounded like he's got some retardation going on?
The realest
Ifa….ifa…sorry to Nate but your gonna be put of your misery Saturday night!!
DIAZ ARMY 209
I hope someone approaches Nate to help him write an autobiography. Everyone wants to read that book.
Nate is so much fun to watch. The most real dude in the UFC. Gotta respect him.
Win or loose nate wil be remembered for yrs I doubt that will be the case with chimaev
Brett all seductive
Reminds me more and more of nick
Respect win or lose
9:51
DUDE YOU SUCK AS AN INTERVIEWER.. NATE SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU, TOO.
Respect to Diaz by taking this fight, even Chimaev was surprise by that.
I like nate bro man is different 🔥
“It’s what I do” - Nate Diaz
One thing is for sure. He will look bloodied up by the end of round 1. But if he persists all the way till round 3, he has an outside chance of finishing khamshot
Forget Nate winning for a sec .. even if the fight goes distance its a Big W for Nate diaz
Aside from Nate being my favorite fighter …He’s gotta be the most openly readable guy he’s very bitter and holding on to loads and loads of resentment that’s holding him back there’s not many more people that’s there own worst enemy
I wanna see the triangle double birds replay!
Doing it for the money no other reason at all
23:10 sounds about right
Against all odds. But i wouldn't be suprised motherfuckers.
#1 Trending and passed Khamzats interview and less time🤯🤯
He sounds really punch drunk.
So delusional, yet I'm rooting for him because I've hated scumbag Dana White for years. He's always treated fighters like garbage. Feeding Diaz to a natural lightheavyweight is just as petty as you can get.
Lotta love for nate, done so much for the sport.
Let's go mate. Shock the world
Whys this so censored? Even censored the word FREE
Let's not forget,  Nate Diaz asked to fight Francis Ngannou 😭😭😭
This is how Charles Manson would of sound like if he had CTE.
It's a crime to censor Nate Diaz interviews
whats he on about, khamzat is ranked higher than diaz. That being said he shouldnt have to a take a fight he dosnt want but ufc did the same for diaz when he was coming up and he wast complaining then
This is the ,most I've ever heard from Nate in all of his fights combined he got a lol deep
“This fight ain’t brought to you by the UFC this fights brought to you by real fight incorporated.” 🔥Tell em Nate. We watched your come up we’re ready to watch that get back now. Let’s go!!
Diaz brothers for life!!!
Shame about the qualighty of the video ...espn should be crisp ..and also considering its a nate diaz interview ..i see this all the time ..real shame
I get mike tyson vibes when nate talks. They both have an edge
23:39 I agree 100% people call them goat They're cheaters not goats
If you carry the 1 .. Nate's MMA math will eventually check out.
NickDiazArmy what’s up Nate’s got this no mater what the outcome is we love you Nate…god bless 💯👊🏿
hahaha he smoked too much weed he had memory loss he was ragged doll and slammed on his head many times by Rory Mcdonald  .
CTE
Let’s go Nate!! Win, lose, or draw you’ll always be the man!! 💪🏼
The peoples champ the real champ of the ufc bs that’s what dudes that can’t win the belt say Nate said he basically beat Leon no he didn’t he landed one good strike in the last minute and lost 49-46 lol not even competitive
👑 Diaz 👊❤️
When Nate made his ufc debute in 2007 Khamzat's pubic hair had just started growing.
"..Kamaru..I'm the  GOAT...he's not over here acting like Kamaru who's f*ckn... I don't even know who he fought..." LMAO 😆🤣🤣 There will only ever be one Nate. Thanks Nate since 2005. You are one of the best. Looking forward to Saturday.  Have a great fight!
Team Diaz👊 Win lose or draw...
No one tells me what to do and that includes when it's the end of an interview, I'll tell you!
why the low quality video espn?
We love you Nate🫀
Brett is so monotone 🥱
"I refuse to be lame"  - Nathan Diaz
#1 on Trending! Nate is a cash cow, goodbye UFC!
I’m not surprised mfers. Let’s go champ 🐐
#1 on Trending, but Nate isn't a draw. He's not a needle mover like Conor.
Nate is one of the GOATS
Win Or Lose Diaz army Forever..  . . .                      ..  💪🏻😎👊🏻   I still can't believe Tony and Diaz at the same card but they ain't fighting against each other 😔 who's the real zombie 🧟  man
Looks like Diaz is emotional
👑
nick diaz army motherfuckers wassup
These boys always made their own fights. "Where you at George "   got Nick his title shot. Both have always fought the fighter that gets the next title shot but not them unless they make it. Dana will always pick his champions and since Diaz boys are not yes men, Dana will never give them the credit of being the best. He sure don't mind using them as stepping stones.  Dana knows he could always call a Diaz when a fighter pulled out and they would say yes.  That's a champion  Nates lookin good tho nice n thick, got some weight on.  Nate wins via submission 1 min left rnd 4
real talk real dog
He's starting to look like Matt damon This interview is painfully awkward too
Realest fighter in the game he's spitting fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wouldn't be surprised motherfuckers
DIAZ DIAZ DIAZ!!
I love nate 👋🏼🤎🤎🤎
Diaz Army 🖕🤘🖕
It looks like Bret Okamoto has a mullet
Nate’s face when he hears the top 5 p4p, I’ll fight all them guys in 5 seconds. Real OG !!
Nick diaz army
Hey Hey , IM NOT SURPRICED MOTHERFUCKERS part 2 is coming .!!! I hope you win Nate. I don't care out the hype of khamzat. You can do it man.
Three outcomes for this fight :  1. Khamzat with the expected W. 2. Nate with the upset. 3. Doctor stoppage cuz Nate got cut up bad. 😑
I understood 22.7% of this
This interview is going to go down as being legendary if he pulls it off and beats khamzat
1 million views under 24 hours. Nate doing better number than some rappers.
Nate is khabib was too scared to continue so we’re the champion of today Gsp jones and silva are the only ones who defended their belts against 3 generation
“You fought burns dawg you fought burns “
The way Nate ends it was classic.
Want him to win so badly just cant see it
He doesn't seem OK
He's a legend and he's definitely left his mark.
Nat Diaz is a real people's champ.
Let’s go champ
I love special people and Nate is my fav
Respect that he has learnt English
Adam Sandler lol
nates so cool hes got eyes on the back of his head
Nate still million view...😆😆
Replace the brother from his concert
I felt everything Nate Diaz said. The real ones don't talk about it.
Call the fight. UFC. Put in the replacement. Burns
This interview really was good.
Nate diaz win or lose 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Hope he get it done somehow
I’m a fan of Nate, but most of this is incoherent! Acting like he beat Leon, he landed a shot that stunned Leon but didn’t drop him and he got smashed for the preceding 24 mins!  Either way I hope that he is competitive against Khamzat, it would be great to see!
UFC need to hire Dave Blackamoto and Oscar Willis to do these sit downs.
Diaz v Tony was the fight to make. Not this. Respect lost for the UFC - trying to punish a man who has already taken a lot of damage. It is visible in this interview.
This is me drunk explaining to my friends why im the best at something
the GOAT 🐐
This guys got cte, and it's sad to see. He's aged a lot
I love how he's just shitting on Usman half the interview 😂😂😂
Mad Dog for life!
After nate beats khumshot we need tony vs nate
Forever a legend
‘Everyone has a 5 year career in the UFC. 6, 7, 10, 12 MAX’ - Nate Diaz, 2022
Great interview! Nates outlook on his fightlife is dope
talks for 30 minutes......this was a great interview Brett, I have to go..........Nate is the best, win or lose.
Thanks for keeping it real, for real too many actors out there. Nate’s one of the real ones.
Great video to analyze his mannerisms. Sure he was high on weed but can feel the emotions when he goes on these rants. Much respect to Nate either way he has stapled himself as a legend of the sport. Knowing this might be his last fight
Nate  I roll with you.
Nate starting to sound like Mike Tyson holding his tears back
Nate speaks like he has serious brain damage
Nate diaz will be mike tyson down to earth kinda guy, allways honest to him self and others
This dude needs some speech lessons.
i would rather watch nate fight anyday then the so called goats of this time.
17:04 🔥🔥🔥
You are right you are the champ top 10 top 5 fights throughout 15 years
DIAZ ARMY!!!!!!
This man is obviously suffering some type of brain injury and the organisers really should be cancelling this fight ,for gods sake hes not playing with a full deck of cards
Nate is the real deal! UFC should do whatever it takes to keep him
Translate to English please
Do you believe it your self mate? You are bollocks mate never ever the greatest fighter loser
That hurt my brain
I love Nate but dude has CTE if he thinks he “beat Leon” Leon absolutely embarrassed him in that fight
Rocky vs Drago....
I feel bad for Nate... He needs help...
This was a great interview Brett! HAHAHAHA NATE YOU GET TO LIVE 4 EVER DAWG. NICK AND NATE DIAZ PERIOD THE END.
Hair looks good Nate, you don't need to smooth it out.
I don't even care about this fight anymore. I can't wait to see Nate's new promotion. How cool would it be to fight for Nate Diaz. I would step in the cage, start pacing back and forth, throw up both middle fingers  and yell STOCKTON MOTHERFUCKER!!!
As much as I enjoy Diaz, he is so delusional that it's scary. He has a full Army of yes men behind him and that's it.
he reminds me of Chuck Liddell at this point
Nate you're a warrior I've been a fan ever since your brother was fighting you pulled off some major upsets,
I bet Nate would beat the sh*t out of Usman in a bar fight, with ease😆
absolute legend of MMA, thankyou Nate for all of the most incredible memories....you are a real OG!! i hope you win brother!
Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Leonardo Di Caprio & Adam Sandler.  The most famous actors I can think of lol
Amazing!
Nate has a chance to win this fight. Can be won in the 5th round by submission by a tired out khamzat.
Nate represents us the underdogs
Nate on #1 trending? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nate shocked the world before. if he beats Khamzat, we are definitely living in a simulation
10:50 Junior dos Santos vs Nate Diaz, one for the ages!
cmon nate shock the world again much respect from europe
Damm man the Main n Co Main is gonna be a Sad if both of these legends lose in traumatic fashion 😏 Hopefully they pull thru 🙏
Bro you lost 14 times what drugs are you taking 😂
Legend!
to people finding hard understanding him. I think his a bit emotional cause he is the LAST of that era of fighters and he feels like he is being put to be killed and he wants to prove that aint no easy road.
17:57 hahahahahaha...So true
What a G... Im here for the upset 🍿 🍿 🍿
This interview is gold. Imagine if Nate wins, this will be cut and replayed many times
Nate Diaz209 Game Up Nutrition CBD All Day Day 💪🏻
There's a good chance Nate will gas out Khamzat but Khamzat is way more tough than anyone he ever fought, I don't see him getting choked out or something. Likely result is go to a decision which Khamzat will win.
Win, lose or draw  NATE IS THE MAN!!!! TRUE LEGEND OF THE SPORT  PERIOD!!!!!!
Nate must be smoking reggie still
Chewed up and spat out by Dana king
"im willing to fight a nig@@ on steroids, idgaf"  - Nate Diaz
'Whatever his f*cking name is' 🤣
Reporter having a hard time explaining his very simple questions to an idiot
Hi, i wanna get reply...
I really hope this is Nate’s last fight coming up. He is already half brain dead, with all due respect. Not gonna be fun to see him in 20 years from now. Sad.
Late rounds are Nates,  just gotta weather the storm
This guy is a legend.
This guy is certifiable 😀
’Everything feels the same’ wow he has been in this loop for some time. A long weed loop, hope he wins. But i think it will be hard
REPRESENT 💯👊 REAL FIGHT INC👊 DIAZ ARMY ROLE CALL👊
Nate would destroy a lot of dudes in a straight boxing match 12 rounds of him coming at you with that gas tank would be a hard task to with stand
Why would you censor Nate?
All the best killers have a lisp. Mike Tyson, Nick Diaz, Drederick Tatum.
no matter what happens.. you MUST respect Diaz
Whats with the terrible video quality?
Idc if he loses, he’s won everyone’s respect over the years whether you like him or not! I’m rooting for my boy Diaz he’s a worrier in the cage.
Nate's impression of Kamaru Usman is spot on 😂
We behind you Nate let’s shock the world again !! I ain’t surprised
"I REFUSE TO BE LAME.... THIS BEEN A GREAT INTERVIEW, I GOT'S TO GO" - NATE 'THE GREAT' DIAZ PUT SOME RESPECT ON THAT MANS NAME... PERIOD.
I know it's a total 1st world problem but 720p video quality uploads?? Sheeeeessh 😂
I completely agree with you.  At work, I had a senior colleague who was living comfortably but had never invested; unfortunately, his job was terminated, and he went from comfortably to barely surviving with his family. He would have had another source of income if he had invested while still working. Investing is a decision made in advance for the future. If you're reading this and haven't yet made an investment, please do so now so you don't end up like my senior coworker.
Right khamzat acting like he’s some Gangster he’s not even close to Nate’s pedigree or put in a fraction of the work Nate has Nate has always been the same dude since TUF and now khamzat wanna come in like he’s some badass when he fled from his country and now wants to claim Chechnya as if that makes him some beast smh delusional hype job khamzat and his delusional bandwagon fans don’t know anything
NDA
Top tier human being
You gotta have patience to sit through this
1:50
What a career and fighter regardless of the result. True raw street fighting heart. Respect
Let's go Nate , bring the energy from cerrone , gomi and miller victories
This it's not a normal fight, this it's a figth between one guy and I company ..
jezzz hope he is not this slow in the octagon .. he is going to get his legacy stolen in his last fight & ppl are going to remember him that way .. sad
Nate Diaz real G for taking this fight. Come on! let's shock the world!!!🎊
209 🔥🔥🔥
Nate’s right tho all these so called Goats and modern fighters talking like they are the best when they haven’t put in the years and time that Nate has nobody has been around as long as Nate and stayed at the top of the division for this many years not one fighter in the ufc has the time Nate has
The peoples champion forever
The Diaz brothers do nothing but complain and whine like little girls… Nate has become delusional with all the brain damage from all the beatings he has taken.
I can understand every word he says, he sounds stoned and as he has since the tuf days. Mans stoned and takes on the best!!❤
Wow a real dude a real fighter what a rarity to witness I'll always be a fan
Shut up baby...mumbo jumbo
I feel horrible for this guy cte having huge effects on him.almost sounds like a troubled youth talking to his therapist reluctantly.
Make no mistake, Nate is the A side in this matchup. The numbers speaks for itself, #1 on trending. Go get the W Nate, we all rooting for you 👊
This is gold ❤
Nate is litterally the UFC's Gatekeeper.  You want that title shot? You gonna have to get through Nate first. Cause he will find out if you are real.  If every match had a 100 rounds, Nate would never lose!
Man, love Nate but he has to correct that Francis Ngannou pronunciation ROFL   At least dont put an i between the N & the G ROFL
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Nobody thought Nate could be conor nobody thought Leon could beat usman nobody thought bisping would be rockhold nobody thought weidman would beat silva nobody thought holm would beat rousey and now we will see another upset when Nate shows the world he’s the man
*Finally a big meal for the wolf* 👍🏻
"So you take stéroïds and i smoke weed and lets get in and squat " Nate Diaz
He has Brain Damage, big fan but he has cognitive issues
Success is determined by the acts or steps you take to get there. Show me a man without an investment, and I'll tell you how quickly he will go bankrupt. Investing is like constructing a safe haven for the future. Profit and interest are 100% assured with the correct investment that has at least 1% minimal risk and expert supervision.
What an interview. It had me laughing, it had me holding my heart and tearing up, it got me angry and amped up, so many emotions. I feel so grateful to experience this era of the UFC. Nate seems so angry and frustrated and sad all at the same time. I really hope he wins by submission on Saturday. I just don’t want him to get hurt or knocked out. This fight is scary. Nate and Nick have the biggest hearts  in the game and that’s why the fans love them so much
Can’t wait to see this fight live, hope he pulls off the upset and flips off the ufc as his final goodbye from the company lol
I am youtuber mere jab 1k subscribe pure ho jaye ge to me 500 ka payment karunga mere channel name legend Fire boy 🔥
In just 33.48 he convinced me that he is the best fighter and the GOAT 🐐
Brett ain't no Helwani
Give that wannabe Abe lincoln a good ol Stockton slap for the Dawgs!!!!
Delusional....
That WAS INCREDIBLE! I have even more love for Nate Diaz! Great interview!!
Win lose or draw Nate will always have an army of fans behind him we respect him and support him no matter what!!
Nate doesn't like Brett. He can't be himself in the interview. A shame to have Brett interviewing Nate.
God, I hope he wins. I like Khamzat too but Nate is the OG.
I just.       Became an even bigger.     Fan of Diaz!!!!!
War Nate Pull that sub and shock the world once again
Still cant get over the fact that nate diaz took on mcgregor on 10 days notice and savved the ppv. He then finished him made him literally quit while he was concious,, then gave him instant rematch so he can make up his legacy. Then diaz loat on a controversial decision and ufc and conor ran witht he tie and never ever gave diaz the rematch. Screwdny at its highest.
Y Nate sound like he’s on drugs
When nate leaves the ufc...I really feel I'm done with ufc..may never watch another fight from them again...
Nate is the UFC gatekeeper
For Nate to beat that ugly motherfucker on his last fight would be absolutely beautiful!. But we'll see what happens, because Khamzat is gonna be real tough. And I'm glad Fedor Is one of Nates all time greats
Chael  and Nate the only 2 undefeated Goat's in the Game. Let's go champ 🥊🥊🥊🥊
The way Nate just ended the interview is Legendary 🤣 a real one through and through
Peoples Champ
Nate Diaz is God's gift to the world 🌎
Mf said nothing but Facts he will always be the champ
What's Nate's best win?
13:40 to 14:30 made me slightly emotional ngl…not sure why lol
Thought this was Dana lol
Nate seemed emotional in the very beginning. Almost like he was going to cry when talking about his dislike for fighting.
Nate has become just a stepping stone these days
I havnt seen anyone open up as much sitting on a sofa since Tony soprano
Talk about brutally honest.  Props to Nate Diaz.  It's been great watching his career.  Diaz vs McGregor 1.  One of the best fights ever.  Hope he busts up Chimaev.  I gotta go.
I think fight can only go two ways Nate by KO round 1 head kick or Nate round 5 submission omaplata
The Diaz Bros are The Goat in my book! Mad Respect! 👊 Always keepin it Real and Badass to boot!.
GOAT!!!
Nate brother call on me I'll fight with u period
Still the baddest man
Nate's Usman impression was spot on. 😂
"This was a good interview Brett,  I have to go.."
Nate, this is a great interview my man. Thank you Nate, thank you do very much, you really communicated so much, gf u r magic
Nate almost KO leon last year instead of pointing he would of had the KO then leon never would have gotten the belt so early... nate is dangerous and nothing to look past he will sleep anyone at anytime.
Nate diaz is MMA.
13:55 it's about making this guy. I felt nade here 😔
Hyped af for this fight gonna watch it at a theater 🤣🔥
Nate is the realest G
Legend!
We ride and die with you Nate!!!!
Now this is a friggin interview...historic even....the sh*t he said and how he said it? Still the OG,the other guys ain't no west coast gangster,YOU know who the real money fight is, me, not these guys they punked off at the press conference.... Also I 100% agree with Nate...you do steroids,you're OUT OF THE QUESTION for being the so called goat,or the best...Jon jones is a punk b*tch....would he whoop my a**,obviously, but hes still a b*tch for how he acts then puts this fake holier than thou bs...f Bones
Diaz has this in the bag
One of the best to ever do it
Simply love this dude. Nate Diaz is iconic in the UFC. Anyone knows Jack squat about the UFC & MMA knows and respects them Diaz brothers eternally.
Khamzat is overrated and Nate will expose him
play at 1.25 to have this seem like a normal conversation haha. let's go nate, hope he pulls off a shocker!
I'd fight with him any day he feels like a brother
It Doesnt matter If Khamzat wins......If Nate wins thats matter....
Mr Iron Chin himself. Much respect.
Greatest interview ever!!! Ask minimal questions and just let the fighter speak their mind. One of the many reasons Okamoto shits on Helwani. 💯
'I reFUSE to be lame'
Absolutely delusional. He's super tough but he was never going to be champ. His mindset is so weird and toxic. I hope he can find happiness in retirement.
"You do steroids, I smoke weed lets just get in there and squab"
Go Nate
This guy ain't got the best record..bt he is a really gangster..did it his way and really became the headline fighter without having to bend knee to anybody..much respect to him always put a show on no matter wat
Legend!
He’s smarter than I thought.  It’s sort of sad that he recognizes he’s being setup to continue the hype for the next guy.
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Lmao nate diaz id 21-13 🤣😂🫦
I hope Nate retires. No disrespect but I really feel like he has brain damage.
He was for sure High real talk tho
So wait.  I'm a little out of the loop and got the fight bug again. If he wins sat is he getting a title fight?
Nate looked baked from the start, love that kid. Props to Nate Diaz, a real legend of a warrior. Not sure Chimaev has got the mental fortitude that Diaz has. All I want for Christmas is for Diaz to slap Chimaev out! Love that he said he had no desire to be a champ, only being a champ for himself. Some cold, hard, life-affirming truth right there.
Nate doesn't need any more hits to the head
It's insane that Nate thinks he won that fight vs. Leon. He really isn't all there.
No words to describe i just LOVE THIS GUY!!!
Nate makes me laugh 😂 😹 🤣
Khamzat is physically much bigger the match makers are sadistic
This guys head is so funked up. Shame
He is a real one! Big respect nate🙏🏻
Nate Diaz therapy session. *Fixed title
Nate Has the weight of the WORLD ON HIS SHOULDERS At the Moment He looks very very Stressed.  Get your money and get out of this bud. To much mental Stress. I can see it eating  you  i find it sad to him like this. Your not a machine you need to take a break we all know you have a heart of a lion.
Nate, I frigg’n love you brother, much love
Time to give Nate his flowers! This man has given his life to this sport and he will go down as a goat
I'm always rooting for Nate! I'm betting 5k, $1000 on each round for him to win 🎰
nate's the goat . shock the world dawg !
I think he honestly is punch drunk.  I'm a huge fan. But I don't know how many more shots he has in him.
amazing interview ! Nate is a true warrior
Big khamzat fan. BUT  Nick Diaz army mthrfkrs !! For life
Nate's slowing becoming his brother
Nate wins and then he calls out Leon and gets the fight over Usman
ESPN 720p in 2020 @espn lol
I got you Nate, the word you were looking for was " The narrative ". Great interview bro you were a Champion!
Also I remember when Nick was the man and Nate was his little brother but Nate has really grown up to be his own man and it’s just crazy I feel old asf!!
fk Khazma UP Diaz!!! rep! Diaz is extremely grounded
nate is not the ufc's 'model' but he is certainly my role model for a fighter and a human being. The realest, the best ever!!!
Game that is spoken out of experience More than 15 years years of it matter fact 💯🧠🔥👌🏿.
I agree if ur taking steroids your a absolute joke of a person 😂😂🤣🤣
ufc did him dirty for not giving him the trilogy fight against Conor !   that would’ve been epic !!
I’m all for Nate but it seems like he is distracted by a lot of stuff surrounding this fight? Why did he take the fight if he didn’t want the fight? I’m not sure I see some eye of the Tiger action going on here. Anything can happen?! I hope he wins!
#1 on trending, Nate Diaz is the man!!!
Let's go Nate, I hope he shocks the world
Classic and all-time move: goes off on a tangent all interview then has the class and respect to compliment the host by saying great job
People don't want to talk about it but the truth is smoking weed has really f***** the diaz brothers up. I just hope Nate stomps the life out of Cumshot
Stockton represent!
@5:08 he is so high right now
This man sounds INCOHERENT,does he even know what he is saying
Nate must have gotten his haircut at a army base this go round 🥴
Bring back Ariel
Khamzat will beat him .......
The sad things about Nate you can already see signs of CTE
Nate "Robert de Niro" Diaz
Brett shouldn’t be allowed to interview either Diaz brother. It’s so awkward 😬
...Adam Sandler 😆
Video quality is real bad
I know you can beat that dude.
I'm routing for Nate but homeslice is straight up delusional. He's been a slightly better than average fighter.
Punch drunk af
Nate Diaz, what a G.
The ufc is going to miss this guy big time
09:49
Love Diaz brothers nobody knows what they talking about deniro vs bj penn 😂😂
The Worldwide Leader in Sports keeps putting content in 720p
Smoke some more Nate.....MERCY!!
nate is spitting some truths there..
I just realized that Nate Diaz would be perfect for BKFC man he’d chop people up
That was Great
Its a business, have no doubt in your mind. The UFC sees dollar signs and then fighters. If KC beats ND then its the launch of a huge career and potentially their next superstar. If ND wins then its a fairytale send off for the GOAT!!! Either way UFC wins.
Nate Diaz is going to win!!
So…what you’re saying is go to college. Thanks Nate!
Nate IS the People's Champion!
I don't know how he pulls it off, but I feel like he manages to be cocky and humble at the same time without contradicting himself. He's one of the realest ones out there
He the BFE main best fighter ever
wow Joshua Fabia great interviewer! lol (not really) no timecodes also.   BAD
let's go nate
I don't care what anyone says.  Nate is the GOAT.
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Nate dogg ♥
C'mon Nate..you became ultimate the day l became disabled..we linked
The ufc done Nate dirty they should have given him his 3rd Connor fight ages ago when they where both in there prime. I mean really he submitted Connor next fight was a decision. He could of had good chance of going for the belt back then now the ufc know he’s older even if he was champ he wouldn’t be able too hold it long they ain’t gonna give him that opportunity again you can tell this fight is more about giving khamzat a push too the top
Hope you win Nate
Nate the new Keith jardine lol
Nate is the 🐐 no matter what happens
Punchy
Brett okomoto looks like he should be selling insurance not interviewing fighters. Dude acts more awkward than luke rockhold
Best interview by far not just by nate but a real look into the fight game and no one understands it more than nate diaz he's officially the goat take aways numbers and he's the illust.....
he would stop tht hype for sure, lets go Nate
Come on Nate. Legend whatever happens
Lmfao did this fool just speak Spanglish 😂 30:55
Brett: Asks one question and Diaz talks for 30 minutes  Diaz: this was a great interview, now I got to go
prime nate wud of most def put khamzat to sleep
Whatever is fkn name is lmao 🤣 😂 he too much main 🤣
Bretts the worst interviewer of all time
I refuse to be lame, bars 🔥
They should add subtitles whenever nate's giving an interview.
Stockton m#$@! Fuckers
Come on Espn. 1080 please. At least lol.
I'm the champion of the whole UFC lmao nates my dog main.
Nate a G
This dude talks like he got serious head trauma rightfully so after all the fights but he still sounds delusional talking about usman and Leon like he didn't get beat up the whole fight except what the last minute of the fight 🤣🤣🤣  Nonetheless I hope he does beat khamzat and goes out knocking off a undeserved loudmouth who thinks he done something when he hasn't. Yea that's what I hope for Diaz but I highly doubt it, certainly wouldn't bet on him
Nate the type of guy who tells the host that it's time to go😂😂😂
I have to watch this with Closed Captioning turned on. Can't understand the GOAT sometimes lol
“A bunch of nerds” 💯
Nate "Ngannu or adesanya whichever" Diaz  😆😆
Win or lose, Nate is a champ in my book. I feel they're gonna brawl in the first, Chimiev gets winded and tries to wrestle later in the match, and Nate is gonna get a submission.
I started watching UFC after the nick and nate era so never really understood why everyone rated them so much. After watching so many of their fights now and interviews, they are the realest people in the UFC by a long shot. Big respect to both of them. You got this Nate 💪
He looks like hes boutta repo someones car lmao
Good luck to the guy but it's baffling how many people rate him. Average record, boring style, personality of a turnip. Rate him for blazing weed and choking out Mcwheezer. That's it.
209
UFC using Nate... UFC respect Nate common...
Why does Nate keep rubbing his head, touching his face? Nervous tick? Or brain damage? He sounds like he has asthma also... Interesting, yet his cardio seems good in the octagon.  Dude can't even talk right or put a sentence together sometimes and wants to stay for the next 15 years lmao... the GOAT with visions of grandeur. Dude needs to retire while he can still talk a little.
Nate Diaz is 'real'; but at the same time you have to admit quite unintelligible and just says whatever is the first 'hood' emotional logic that comes to his head and doesn't give anything any deep thought or apply reason to his thoughts or actions.
Hold on let me put my pants on😭☠️ Classic Nate for y'all!
Nate is awesome. I hope he wins.
Nate is half delusional but I'm here for it.
I love Nate, he is so gangster, but he's gonna get touched Chimaev is not to be played with.
Nate just wanted to retire but their forcing him to fight. Go out with a bang. Your a legend
I’m so confused.
8:35 What'd he say about Oliveira? Anyone?
Nate knows he's basically being sent to the slaughter house
People with an iq of about 3 impressed by Diaz' incoherent sentences lol  Khamzat gonna smesh this guy!
Nate's more intelligent and aware thn most think!! Put some respect on it!!!! 💪✊🤘
Lets go
Im not a Nate fan but I feel his true fan base doesn't care about the things he says because most of his takes are outrageous and they know it. They just follow his persona and like him.
Don't cry
Nate makes you laugh, get hype, and be serious all in one interview😂 How do you not love this guy bruh NDA
This was a deep dive into Nate's mind. He crazy but awesome.
NATE JUST WON MY HEART, I LOVE THIS DUDE!!❤️
Thank you nate dog for everything......
If you are doing steroids, just out of the question. Nate speaks the facts.
Nate ain't making weight
What was he saying about oliveira
ESPN 720p ??? Y’all cheap chodes couldn’t afford a 1080p camera
Mumbeling mf
One Word Respect---4eva Nate Dias...
Diaz All Day 🔥
Nate's coming in different. He might win.
LETS GO NATE!!! Hope you shock the world Saturday.
Can listen to this mf story all day Netflix get your doc before Hulu or apple get on this west coast gangster
Nate Diaz is the baddest mofo in the UFC. Real 💯💯👑👑. It sucks how everyone is counting him out. Let's go Diaz. My brother 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
So delusional … I think he still would be happy if he won the belt
Nate is the king
This reminds me. Nate isn't about winning or losing, it's about how he never gives up.
12:35 when you do the math and come to the conclusion that you're just the realest mf'er in the game
LETS GOO NATE!!!!! don’t shock the world. Do exactly what we know your capable of and stop the hype train
Wow I think that's the first time I've heard Nate say he enjoyed an interview 🙌 well in Bret
Nate like the old mike
“You fought burns dawg” 😂😂
whats up with 720p
There’s only one person in the UFC that’s dumber than Nate and it’s Kumzhot! But I love Nate and hope he wins
"I refuse to be lame" cit. Gotta love his attitude
Nate saying he’s going to war with the organization made me a lil sad. Would be awesome to see him flip the situation on its head
Nate seems sad man..
they really be filming this on a potato
I love Nate Diaz... When he did his your welcome rant to Dubai 🤣🤣🤣
nate ,  you are a champion 🏆.   you turn up ,   the people's champion.  👏,   your my goat , 🐐.    shut the ufc  up .  your focused. no pressure push the fight champion 💪,   your a goat.
Nate big tymin🥷 “You are still their champ”
Let's go gangster.....
The greatest was Ali  The greatest mma fighter is Nate
Can hardly hear Walt Jr. He's gettin smoked anyway
First time ive been in the middle both these guys are Top Gz
Nate looks genuinely upset over the situation, I hope he beats Khamzat
He's good at getting beat up, taking alot of punishment,that's it...500 fighter
This man has stopped Mcgregor. Nobody gave him chance. Yet he schocked all. Lets go Nate!!
No offence to nate but i feel like he is really under the influence here.
UFC did him dirty giving him this fight but also it's epic.
How can anyone take this guy serious
I couldn't make it halfway through the interview. Listening to him is actually painful.
Nate really got going here about halfway through. Awesome interview, riding with diaz this weekend for sure.
Nate Diaz Is going to be in worse shape then chuck Liddell in 3 years tops
If Nate somehow beats Chimaev he would have shocked the world twice.
That was perfect
Love me some nate but dam it's hard to follow him when he talks he is all over the place.
I like Nate but he’s not ready for this fight
Dudes crazy. But he makes so much sense. Looking forward to Nate being a free agent.
Nate is high but speaks facts 🤣
3 questions  250    h _hmm  A couple of yea  And 1 Loooooonnng Answer from the one and only Nate Diaz.   The Best interview I ever see
I wouldn't be surprised if he knocks out Khamzat! Today is September 7, 2022, remember I said it first! 😁
Nate i am from south africa i have been you're biggest fan since the day you started in the ufc win or loose we all will respect you as a goat 🐐 ufc would not have been where they are I've it wasn't for you we all love you bro and respect you
Khamzat might be my favorite fighter right now but Diaz is a dog. I can see this being a grueling 5 rounder.
Really feel bad for nate in 10-15 years 😬😬
The Only notable win in his career is Beating Conor McGregor. Love nate but he's overrated as an MMA artist. He's a walk forward punching bag. Love him though. But hey atleast nate's a real G and not a coward like Khabib who runs away as soon as he sees equal competition in the division. And never moved up. But weight bullied strikers in 155 lol. Gotta give it to nate when it comes to things like that.
Usman in the process of raising a 🐐  his daughter 😊😉
I really like this dude, isn't comfortable talking on camera but still manages to give us an interview where we get to see what's going on inside his mind. He's a special martial artist/fighter.
Speaking facts on Usman! Usman is whack af!
Volume so low fix it espn
Really hope Nate goes out there and wipes the floor with Chimaez, unfortunately though I feel he will get butchered
Pull the upset!!!!!
His negotiation tactics r wild
I love how Brett and Ariel each open up completely different sides of Nate in interviews and both sides reveal different interesting things about his character and mentality.
Go get em Nate, hardly anyone wants you to lose my man 🙏🏻
Show respect for the OG nobody is recognizing that he is in the UFC even when Dana White is broke
Shoulda done the sitdown with Ariel
He's 100% correct that the pressure is all on Chimaev
The fact this hit a mill before the day ended warms my heart as a diaz fan forreal. I remember when people aint care about em. Happy hes where he is now. He deserves it
this felt like a soldier forced into a therapy session he didn’t wanna do 😂 lets go nate
NATES LAST FIGHT!!
Nate Diaz 🔥👍👍
Im buying the fight only because of Nate! I’m a boxing guy but Nate is a Legend! I’m hoping for you bro!!! Must watch fight
Legend! The real champ!
One day UFC will do the same thing to Khamzat that they have done to Nate.
Why all the Usman hate?
Ferguson vs Diaz would have been an awesome fight. 😭
The realist ninga
A real living anomaly.
😂 "Where u gonna be in 3 years, ur gonna be knocked out on ur face out the door"
This is what weed will do to you kids..
nate wants to say fu ck the ufc badly but dont' wanna give them the time of day. if nate chokes out khamzat the world is gonna explode so will dana and hunters head!
I dreamt that he submitted Khamzat.. waiting to see how true my dreams can be.
The Mike Tyson of the UFC for sure 🐐 legend!
DARE…to stay off Drugs!
Love seeing that Nate Diaz was happy with the interview puts a smile on your face
Props to Brett for not interrupting Nate, it helped Nate to open up his feelings.
Win or loose Imma still be an Indonesian Diaz Army!!!
He's about to fight a real killer. This isn't make believe...
He lives in a delusional reality
"You should have worked on the computer somewhere you nerd" Nate is a different breed
LOL THIS WAS AMAZING
Hes like an alcoholic dad who threatens you for no reason
CCCCCCCTTTTTTTTEEEEEEE
Does he have any kind of brain damage from all the fights? He acts weird and slow
Legend
Nate hates talking about feelings and is asked three "how does it feels"  within the first 14 seconds
If Diaz loses we Riot
Props to everybody who watched the video all the way through
I like nate but he seems like he's reminiscing and he's accepting any outcome.... he needs the killer instinct back for 1 more fight....
Diaz brothers are the true spirit of this fighting game! .. tough m/f and not full of steroids!  Proper fighters!
Why no 1080p ESPN?
this is gonna be nuts!!!!1
He is the champ👊🏻💪🏻
Go Nate !!
The way Nate ended the interview just shows how he truly runs the show. The bit where he talked about the fight he instigated in the Tuf house was hilarious. Win or lose I'll always be a fan of Nate!
Respect to Diaz love him but hes gonna get smashed.
Nate Diaz the illest Mexican street fighter...need to join that BKFC....
And the video quality?
I like how Nate always stops his interviews.
Nates impression of Usman was fantastic 🤣🤣
Nate Diaz for president
to many head shots mixed with lots of weed is the product of nate diaz hes all over the place this interview made me not like him one bit no one knows what hes talking about
One of One, he kept it real.
Subscrib Karea
It seems to me that Nate Diaz has a memory fart in this interview or am I Wrong?
“You Fought Burns Dawg” 🤣🤣
I wanna say poor nate but foo down af reminds me of Tyson personality
War Diaz !
Shout out to espn for not cutting parts out
classic nate diaz
get it nate
win or lose respect
This interview is so hard to follow but yet so satisfying to watch. Wish they didn’t bleep half his comment out.
Don
Nate says im back ! and legend, get payed soo buckle up! ....And under meantime "Btw when was i here before, why WHY was here before? And when and did i win against who?? och where are we and who are u and who im a fighting?? Btw im back matthafack"  Love too see Nate back THE LEGEND
I love all the interviews with nate is him ranting
Nate would be my best friend.
Best. Interview. Ever.
Yooo that usman impression was dead on 🤣🤣🤣
This interviewer sucks
Diaz army for life.  You are my/ our Champion Sir.  Best and realest MF in the the game.
Fedor Malenko
Crazy how loose he is
Bret didn’t get a word in! 💀
No matter the out come this is gonna be an absolute slug fest.
I'm the G.O.A.T motherf#%k, bow to the real King 👑 🌞#46🌛😎
Real right there, diaz says it like it is you've got to respect the guy, hope he bows out with a great performance, win or lose truly one of the legends of the game the people's champ for sure.
What is he talking about our? He’s sounds punch drunk.
I hope he shakes up the world again..
Hate watching Brett Okamoto interviews dude knows absolutely nothing about fighters or fighting or the history of the ufc ot even seems like the fighters don't like him either ESPN needs to can his dumb a$$
The BORZ was right; the man can't speak English too good.......
im not suprised  MTF !!
‘Bunch of nerds’ Brett - ‘haha 😒’
nate is a all time great. but he is clearly disgruntled about his employer. feeling like they neve rbuilt him up and see him as some kind of gatekeeper for future stars. But in the end it makes him a a bigger draw when he does fight them. After mcgregor he blew up to the mainstream
I respect Diaz so much but man it hurts to hear this man talk. He's so punch drunk already and he's not even in his 40's. Stop fighting Nate. You're already a legend...nothing to prove.
Is he getting punchy? He's forgetting a lot of things, and slurring almost   Nate might have cte
Nates not scared of anyone.... When you grow up the way him and nick did, you fought the scariest people in the real world. With real consequences, ufc fighters are easy.
Okamoto's lack of presence is actually great for interviews with guys who need to open up. The guy can listen.
16:34 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Win or lose, imo Nate is deserving to be a Hall of Famer. 😎
30:55 first time I've heard Nate say something in Spanish
Good luck Nate
Nate could have said no to this fight.  They sacrifice their future health so we have something fun to watch on Saturday nights. I hope these guys get whatever their hearts desire in this life.
This fight isn’t about this guy, it’s about making this guy. He knows what the UFC thinks of him
Rickson Gracie is the best
this interview is a little hard to watch at times.. you can hear and see so much emotion.. will be sooo interesting to hear his speech in the cage after the fight.. that will be must see TV..
Nate Diaz is the man,100% genuine,100%real,
Even dana said that khamzat is the next khabib, so definitely they are trying to bring up this character, pretty sure they will try to make him beat 29-0 even, by staging more fights with fighters past their prime. Win or lose Nate is irreplaceable
Nate Diaz won. Regardless of what happens saturday night, he won. In order for the ufc to get that trilogy with McGregor now, they’ll have to co-promote with REAL FIGHT INC. That means Nate Diaz will get a HISTORIC percentage of the revenue share, a bigger piece of the pie than any fighter has been able to negotiate off a single fight.
Drugs are bad 🤦‍♂️ why would any responsible adult upload this, this is embarrassing
I remember Nate, he didn't talked like that. I mean he wasn't very clear and didn't enunciate very well. But, I don't know, he talks and moves differently.
Nate is one of the original OG’s 👊😎
You drink to  much Nate, go sleep in 11 Sept😂
I can’t take this guys voice seriously lol   he sounds like he already has brain damage
Nate is right about most things, but can't see what's problem with this fight. We can speak a lot of smack about Dana, gotta give him credit for this one. The timing the hype the stories of this fight, made it bigger than most title fights. Nate clearly said he wants to fight just top guys of the division, they offered him khamzat before Burns it didn't make sense, now he a top 5 there u go, plus biggest paycheck for sure not including conor fights. Win win for everybody, can't wait. Honestly other than title shot I don't see better fight than this for Nate..
Nate also said you take steriods and come out an say it i smoke weed and jts good but nah all yall try to hide it
Am I the only one who has been seeing Nate’s cognitive skills declining over the years?
Diaz👊🏽
Love Nate but my man has CTE and needs to retire
"I refuse to be lame" Nate Diaz.
NATE DOGGG!!!!!
always felt bad for him, sweet guy and has a violent job, people come at him, diaz bros very senseative and you feel their hurt. sad part of sport..dana using him because he wants to leave. pray he fucks mat up i think hes gonna lose but heart wants him to do it give finger and walk out..
Nate’s the realest to ever do it
Got love for Nate & Nick I respect them & how they would fight anybody and time but they don’t be winning fights & they go against Dana & the UFC so much that the UFC don’t celebrate them like hall of fame legends that they are so this being how it ends isn’t shocking but the army gone always be behind them
Diaz by sub in Round 4.
I was shocked at alot of the fighters saying Nate would be "murdered " like really ? I don't think so !!
Nate "the time i almost beat up dana white"Diaz
Awesome interview,,
Interviewer: mhm.... mhhmm... mmmhm... mhmm
I've got 50 on this man because I respect him. If I lose, so be it.
turn the volume even lower
Someone better ask Dana about the time nate almost beat him up lol
UFC will never be the same without you, Nate.
This is the best Nate Diaz interview ever
I have to admit I have never been a Nate Diaz fan, but I would love nothing more then to see him win this fight!
Nate Diaz is the love child of Robert De Niro and Mike Tyson………
"This was a great interview Brett......I gotta go" hahhahaahaahahahaha man Nate is hilarious
21:07 😆😆🤣 he voiced what we all felt. Men much respect to Nate and Brett is an excellent therapist 👏 👏
For real, is it ok that we let Nate fight for our entertainment? Shouldn't he be in like a group home making macaroni necklaces or something? No disrespect.
I expect Nate to KO Chimaev
Expect a slap 👋
Nick and Nate MADE a family, a community,  out of their friends and students. What he says in this interview about wanting to take 10 of his people with him into the UFC shows how much the "Nick Diaz Army" means to him.   The Diaz brothers are a rarity. They are exceptionally skilled and tough fighters that refuse to use steroids even when most fighters are. In their view, becoming a champion via PED's is illegitimate. What Nate says in this interview is very true, he gets injured but has never lost a fight and simply runs out of rounds. Nick very similarly also, never KO'd or submitted. That makes them GOAT's.  The mindset is that they are both already champions minus the title. Nate also makes some great points here about his legacy and neither he or his brother were ever given many opportunities to fight for a title despite fighting top 5 ranked guys for years and despite their longevity in the sport (not to mention their popularity with fans.) The UFC may have thrown him to the wolves with this Khamzat fight, but in Nate's mind he is frustrated that the fights he tried to make that he knew the fans would want, never got made for his last fight. He is clear: He didn't want Khamzat but accepted because he will fight anyone and wants to be a free agent.  I wish him the best for his family, his little girl and his wife. I hope he beats Khamzat and walks away from the sport and focuses on his ventures; Real Fight INC, his weed business and the Academy and his coaching. Equally, I hope Nick (if he does decide to return to the UFC) comes back strong for one of two big payday fights: McGregor would be a good one tbh, although I know people are saying that's not the fight to make. It would be nice to see Nick make some $ after such a huge layoff and retire after showing the world again just how good a fighter he is. Although equally, be happy to see him focus on his Academy and start a family. I think married life and children would fill a void in him, personally. He'd make a good father I believe.  Much ❤️ to the Diaz brothers.
If Nate wins and just give a big middle finger to the ufc and leave the promotion, and khamzat being beaten would be crazy. Mic drops.
I got Nate.
Imagine a convo between him and biden . Neither understand what the other is saying.
When he called usman a nerd I literally dropped dead 💀 ☠️ 🤓😂😂

15:17 - "It's not the UFC putting on Nate Diaz vs f**ing whatever his f**ing name is" ))
“I’d fight all them in 5 seconds.” Lol
Kids don't do drugs
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Old man and the sea.
What an absolute ICON
Nate’s looking old
Let’s go mate, you can tell he’s gona try hard on this one
Lets go Nate, Keep your Dukes up Bro✊️✊️
Let’s go Nate Diaz, get in that octagon, do some ninja ish, get paid, and leave. Gameplan 209.
My favourite and forever...full RESPECT 🙏🏼
What a tradegdy to the sport losing this man will be! I hope everyone remembers who the real baddest MF always was! I've never witnessed another man with such a heart of a lion! Probably never will again
Hope Nate wins
If those nerds are goats, Diaz is thier Shepherd.
Go Nate Go!!!
ហ
The End of Nate is the End of the Golden Era. Nate didn't care about belts... He just wanted to scrap. And that's why he was always the People's Champion. 💯
how can anyone hate Nate? He might not be flawless but he was the work horse taking fights just because he was asked. He wasnt chasing a quick route to the belt. His fights are always entertaining, tell me they arent..
Nate seems way more open in this interview than any other I've seen. He's also incredibly better spoken compared to any time before.   That being said, I just hope for Nate's sake this is going to be a quick beating so he can continue his fight career a bit longer. I doubt he'll still be in the sport in 2-3 years.
He remeinds me of Chester Bennington when his depression was the worst. Really heavy and indifferent vibes coming from Nate 😕
is he scared?
End was epic😅
If you're Mr. Goat then make a goat.  - Nate Diaz
Think about how many people Nate sees that the ufc says is the best and new upcoming guy.. there’s new up coming guys every day.. now to be in the ring 15yrs plus that’s a real champion.
“Cause I’m willin to whoop a n**** on steroids” 😂😂😂
Dana take care of my boy Nate he s a top G
Cali in this mf get lost ‼️‼️‼️ the king has spoken 🗣🗣🗣👑
Nick Diaz Army preparing for war
Straight G
Nate you had me at hello bro.
Nate: with all due respect to them  Also Nate 2 seconds later: Fu** them!
Go Nate!! 💚🤙🏽

The first Connor fight nobody thought he could do it and then what happened? Tap Tap
Take notes 📝 yall
I agree with Nate being the goat. Dude has been doing it for almost as long as Ive been sober. 209 represent.
Man ESPN really needs Ariel back so bad lol
Nate Diaz for president !!!
The realist OG in the game! I'm ridin with Nate everytime!
on TUF 5 Nate also called out Rob Emerson, everyone on the teams said he was the hardest guy in the house & there's a clip of Nate saying that's another reason why he wanted to fight him
Amazing ending.  Nate will never fight lame. First and last time he ever heard Boo was in WEC
Nick diaz army motherfuckers win or lose ❣❣❣
If it Diaz brothers interview they will only talk.  😅
12:34 is when the interview starts
Nate Diaz is a legend  He gots this
Nate Diaz. Head kick. Fifth round. Lol
Please turn up the volume for old farts like me ffs. It's already hard enough I'm trying to understand what Nate is saying.
🐐
War Diaz 💯
Video quality is horrible
Chandler, Poirier, Luque, Chandler. All would’ve been fine opponents solid analyzes and request from Nate Diaz…. Great fights!!!! But He only has a few wins lately much more losses but I mean if that’s how he feels respect Nate 🫡
There's similarities between Diaz and Tyson in the way they talk
Hope Nate pulls this one off and retires. He doesn’t need more brain damage.
Nate💪💪💪
Why bretty is still workin and talkin about mma. He can talk in some talk show not here🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ when i hear his voice i turn of immediately every time
Greatest ending to an interview ever. LOL!!
Real fighter incorporated⚠️‼️❗️‼️❗️⚠️❗️‼️❗️⚠️⚠️❗️‼️❗️⚠️❗️‼️❗️⚠️‼️❗️‼️⚠️‼️❗️⚠️‼️‼️❗️‼️❗️⚠️⚠️⚠️❗️‼️‼️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️‼️‼️‼️⚠️⚠️⚠️
Man i hate the way tge censor his cuss words its not the same with out that delivery 😑
Brett a bad interviewer
I would like this video twice if I could.
💪🏽🇺🇸
Nate: "Nobody tells me what to do!" Also Nate: **goes to interview ufc told him to do with brett** 😶🤣
YOU AINT NO F****** CHAMPION asking for permission 😅😂😂😂 Nate Diaz You a LEGEND BRO
This time “Surprise Surprise MF’ers!”
I am fan..... But he seems kind of dumb
Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Sandler
Man he asked for everybody apart from khamza... 😱... Khamza s fear is clearly visible on nate..
The word Nate was looking for was “NARRATIVE” all of you need to hear that. F$&k the Narrative!
The king has arrived
Yo I can relate like the champs of the bj penn, era was the height for me .. Liddell, coture, sho gun, A.Silva, sonnen, Aldo on wec faeber wec, even lesnar young cowboy young Nate Dawg… nah fr  Strike force heavyweight Grand Prix.. so much heat
Lol why does he want to fight ngannou so bad
Nate! Get out there and shock the world! Even though you will not be surprised !!!
Common if it's your last fight in ufc fight like one . Bring that beast down. We all believe you will. All love for diaz brothers ❤
Just respect brother
It's all about selling the ppv.
The most universally loved fighter
My CTE actin up 🤭🤭🤭
Let’s go nate , i hope he wins
Why is the quality so bad
Nate is the champion of whole ufc
The fk is this interviews the quality of the video look like shi*
"This was a great interview Brett."   Diaz is awesome.
Thank you for letting big bro talk 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Charlie Zelenoff
Why is Nate so 😔 sad ?
The greatest test of faith is when you don’t get what you want, but still you are able to say THANK YOU LORD. Subscribe your Channel........ ❤️❤️❤️
Coming up from the Gracie family makes him a legend off top. But idk? Nate can beat kahmzat? But he definitely has the ability and fight IQ too. But imo nate and even nick have taken too damage over the years. And nates way of speech shows it. They slur there words real bad and just sometimes don't make sense at all. But either way I wish nate the best in his future endeavors. Wether he wins or not? Now I do want to see nate win just for the shock of the MMA world of he does? And I think khamzat is overrated from what we've seen imo. Burns won that fight to some people. I think it was very very close myself but do give khamzat the edge and win imo. But the burns fight showed that khamzat is somewhat over hyped imo. I have to see him fight more top names to decide how good he actually is?  So either way I hope we get a great fight and I'll be happy to see either win.
Nate Diaz opens the knotfest
Nate the man.
FACT: Dana matched Nate against Khamzat for 2 reasons, BLOOD=MONEY!!  Dana knows there will be plenty of blood, knows Nate will never give up, and will leave every once of his blood in the octagon!!
I feel like nate is the underdog most people can relate to. He’s the underdog at his own work place like how most of us are in ours. He’s a unique person true to himself no matter what. His fighting style is something fans love because even casuals will enjoy the stand and bang because most of them won’t get the intricacies of the grappling. They just see it as “hugging”. If he goes that’ll be a shame. But I’m not mad at him. He and his brother bring the fight and are one of the most entertaining to watch and even if you hate them admit it it’s fun to hate on them too. Good luck wherever your journey takes you nate
I dont like how UFC is treating Nate as filler for upcoming star
Almost 1M views in less than 15 hours!
This guy fought and fought for like 15 years nearly now, win draw or lose he has a bigger fan-base than most and it's well deserved.
The end of a legacy is always sad
I should have brets job
I would love nothing more than for Nate to grab Rogans mic, lean in, and say "Im not surprised MotherFkers...". Flip Dana the double fingers and walk out of the octagon. The odds are not in his favor, but never count a Diaz out.
"Nate Diiiiaaaaaaaaz!" ⚡
GOAT without a belt , win or lose he’s a brawler never scare to fight the best, respect
Nate’s the f***ing KING! Win, lose or draw, we’ll always love Nate Diaz. In 20yrs we’ll still talk about the Diaz brothers. How many other fighters can you say that about?
the ending of this interview is unbelievable, and people don't get it.. he said I have been in the real fight game and will continue to be in the real fight game... this is a real dog.. I mean some people in the comment section do not even understand the scope of a 15 year old fight career is like.. and another 15 years? bro wow
Autism
UFC always disrespected the Diaz bros. They even gave him Brett as the interviewer. Damage control. Lmaoo
The UFC expect nate to lose! I hope & pray he goes out with a bang and knocks Chimaev clean out because if anybody deserves the win its Diaz, theirs only oooonnnnee nate Diaz singing along walking in a winter wonderland hey hey, theirs only oooonnnnee 😄😄 what a fight this is going to be!!! Come on nate your army is behind you, you got this 👍💯🙏
Hi, i wanna get reply...
I love Nate but he said all but  literally "I know I lose this" his mind isn't in the right place for a fist fight.
🤣🤣🤣
Remember this - diaz made masvadal and got totally disrespected !!!! 🖕🖕 all the foolz !!! The realist Best MF ! Nick Diaz Army Mthafakaz.
I believe 🙏🙌
You gonna upload a good quality version of this? Surprised this trash isn't black and white.
Sucks that the UFC has all these prefight promotional videos about UFC 279, covering every fighter except Nate. I watched "UFC 279 UNLEASHED" expecting to see Nate, it was all Khamzat
Nate gonna shock the world
Am rooting for Diaz.."not surprised MFs"
Over all tho good interview
I'm worried about Nate in this fight , love the guy but I think he's in for some serious punishment
Lets go homeboy people's champ fuc that vato do it for LA RAZA...
I'm from Sacramento I'm in NorCal man myself I root for Nathan Diaz every time he fights every time he fights I expect him to win so do I expect him to win on September 10th of course I do Diaz for the win by submission fifth round
It was just pretty much Nate expressing his feelings lol like a therapy or something
Who is the interviewer?
I not surprise mofo !!
Saying Dana was all "petho" is the most Mexican thing I've ever heard Nate say lol
Definition of nonchalant 🇲🇽💙😎
Diaz all day / Diaz all night. 🖕🖕
"I'm willing to fight niggas on steroids."                          ~ Nate Diaz 😆
Nates right, id rather watch a Diaz fight all day over a Izzy fight.
Where’s Ariel..jk Brett’s the man
If you the goat, make a goat. Nate’s a legend

Nate's going to be a great promoter, the Diaz bro's truly believe they've never lost a fight.
Humble Nate. I'll never count him out after choking McGregor. I be grown to thrive off the guy highly. But Chimaev Kills him.
Nate does some good Kamaru Usman impressions 😂
This guy deserves way more than he gets straight up G
Can you spell CTE?
Shock the world again Nate!!!

REPRESENT👊🏽⚔️🛡️🪖🇺🇸 WAR READY

Real one💯🇳🇱
I really hope Nate goes out there with a chip on his shoulder and sticks it to the UFC with a win. I like Khamzat,  but I don’t think this loss would really have an impact on his title journey. It’s gonna happen either way, he will get his shot regardless
lol he's a dam trip he has taking to many shots to the head... but it would be crazy if he did get the win!!!! then I would ask for a lot of money dana!!!! HE NAILED IT ABOUT JON JONES AND SILVA THEY ARE NOT GOATS....
18:00 thank me later
i hope nate does like he did against conor the first fight, i hope he spoils kumslut chimneybreath's coming out party...
I like how Nate just closed out his own interview.
Much respect warrior
You got this ! From the South to the North  Nate's the best of course. Let's Go ! !! We believe in you  *G* Believe in yourself Know you can You da Man and That's that! ! Let's Go!
"Fadormalenko" 😂😂
after watching this ... khazmat first min ko
The two best in the game.brett and nate...sorry  👃
I really hope Dana looks after Diaz for all the work he’s put in for the brand by just being himself 🙏🏼❤️
Sucks man Nate seems really down and not himself. Feels like the UFC really under appreciate what he has helped do for the sport
It sucks they’re using Nate as a stepping stool for other fighters. He is absolutely the most entertaining fighter I’ve ever watched. He deserves to call his own shots and get the fights he wants after everything he’s done for the UFC. I hope Nate shocks the world Saturday.
Nate should be fighting Mazvidal for the rematch, not kazmat
Don’t know what his deal is with Usman but Nate is a G, he’s funny af and he does what he wants haha. Respect to him, real af
I feel bad for Diaz, he seems very upset and off. Probably cuz he knows it’s the end and this is all he knows. I hope he find something after this that will make him feel happy and good! Love you Nate!
I think Leon respected Nate a lot, especially his BJJ game so he didn't wanna finish him. Khamzat has no respect. So someone is getting finished. I see Khamzat getting sloppy on the ground tho and getting tied up in something
God this is tough to listen to
Holy mackerel, it’s a good thing Nate Diaz can fight. He is the dumbest professional athlete on the good green earth
Nate sees losses as wins, and wins as wins 😂 i love it
Nate "Never good enough to be a UFC champion so let's make fun of all the current and past champions" Diaz
This guy has CTE.  Someone should get this guy help.
I’ll admit I was never a big Nate Diaz fan. I never disliked him or even had an opinion but he’s made a fan out of me. Gotta respect this guy win or lose
Number one on trending for YouTube. PAY THIS MAN WHAT HE’S WORTH HE’S A LIVING UFC LEGEND
Awkward AF. All fight IQ/punch drunk with a lack of education. Hope he wins and rides off into the sunset.
I feel like if he loose this fight this is gonna be his last one. I want him to win. He's a once in a lifetime fighter.
Number 1 trending video on YouTube in world rn a UFC fighter that ain’t easy, man against all odds Nate your a sed of pac in mma gloves
"I refuse to be lame!"  Truth
He’s serious about fighting Francis to 😂😂
Ultimate contender 😂😂
Lol Brett's Japanese side took over in this interview. " Hm hmm, hm hmm, hm hmmm" 🤣 and he gave us a gem of an interview just by letting Nate vent.  Gawddamn, how can not root for this guy? What a human lol
Top 5 pound for pound I can beat them all in 5 seconds 🤣 love it the realest in the game still 💯
Nate reminds me of mike tyson and I love it…I roll with Nate all day
No other fighter has inspired more than Nate to be true to myself, to work hard on my body, to not change just because its "trending". You're a f*cking legend for me Nate. Respect Sir!
Isn’t khazmat putins boy?
Boy I wish Nate could speak more clearly !!! I know there's so much he's seen in the game and can talk about. I guess he's sold his soul to the game and signed a code of secrecy to never talk about it. What a guy he is
Diaz shocks the world again 9/10
Nate is one of the GOATs
Kumshot will get Stockton slapped 😂
I love khamzat.   But don't want nate going out on an L. They turned his back on him nasty.
Nate’s eyebrow looks like if he touched it would bleed lol Nate by submission Rd 4
Nate has been a inspiration for me my whole adulthood  If he wins this fight I don’t know what to say 🥷
Nate when he starts to bleed he still becomes very dangerous.
“Where’s your guy? If you’re Mr. GOAT, make a GOAT. Prove it.”

Most realist interview

I’ve never wanted an upset so much…
Hi, i wanna get reply...
@8:36 Nate got me crying rn sound like a brotha when he said that 😭😂
He’s BARELY a modern human 🤣🤣
In the fight game you can`t rule out the Diaz brothers. Nate has more heart than cumshot. Lets go.
Leshhhh Goooo Nate ..
Only Nate Diaz can say “you fought burns” and make it seem like Chimiav is overrated haha meanwhile Burns is one of the baddest out there
Definitely always been my favorite fighter. He’s a mf pimp

If you are mr goat then make a goat. Lol
To slow for me.!! I can finish his sentence before he does.!!
4 minutes in and he already asked "does it still feel the same?" Like 4 times lmao who's that guy?
wow.. nate has finally come out and express himself.. I guess he was waiting for this moment to retire to tell it all.. lol unbelievable interview.. wow so much insight and perspective of the fight game.. Nate is a real dog.. lets be real Nate has been in the fight game for over 15 years.. I mean come on?? who can even say that? wow Nate respect brotha.. that smoking definitely has benefits to it.. lol.. wow bro Blessings
The way he finished the interview "this was a great interview Brett I have to go"  that was hilarious. Classic nate
Save this man at all cost @natediazarmy
There will never be another duo like the Diaz brothers. No initial push from the machine then the machine falls in line. They really forced the houses hand. Legendary careers
you know when Nate's talking about going and telling his boys about how you do it, he's talking about how he rocked Leon in the last round then pointed and laughed at him. The MF could have finished it if he really put the gas on instead of mocking him! 😂😂
“This was a great interview Bret, I have to go” 😂😂😂💯
Nate I'm Chicano...I liked you and your brother...but I don't agree you just slapping that reporting dude. That's a punk move. Fight in the octagon.
I've never wanted a fighter to win this bad in my life.
the truth hurts NATE FOR LIFE 🇧🇷 🙌
This dude talks so much gibberish. But he is fearless.
Nate breaking down street wisdom I forgot about. There is a big difference between athletes, performers and warriors.  Nerds and numbers can get you further but further to what? Ambitious goals, money, fame, titles..?  Authentic doesn't respect that. Respect and real is the wealth behind a name.
This guy is delusional. He lost many fights and still think he is the greatest.
20:01  Francis "Nigganou" N'Gannou
This ain’t even an interview, it’s a babble
Bounced out on his time..  gotta love it
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WILL BE SHOCKED IF HE WINS ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WATCHED 3 UFC FIGHTS.
Bro what’s with the victim whoa is me mentality …my guy you choose to fight. You’re a mega star that makes millions, cut the pity party. Who cares what people think or feel of you . Go out there and do what you do.
No matter the outcome all love and respect to Nate and Nick DIAZ ARMY FOR LIFE
Delusional warrior. I hope he derails the hype 🚂
"If you Mr. GOAT, make a goat! U kno what I'm sayin?"
This man out here roasting mfs 🤣 no chill
Wish there was an uncensored version. I feel like Nate is really speaking his mind and flowing and it’s taking away from it.
Love Nate Rarely does he answer the question. Hope his health is good
Nate is a REAL one. I hope he smokes chimaiev with a traingle choke while giving double birds
you gettin destroyed in 1 min 38 seconds
We believe you can get it done
nate too delusional and the weed destroyed his mind
The Diaz brothers…only “real” fighters in the ufc.
Give Nate royalties on this video and every other fighter who does interviews for this channel espn
Lets go Champ
Nate AINT LYING!!!  NICK DIAZARMY FOREVER!
45 5454y
45 5454y
@5:10 he talks about famous actors and then talks about his hero's...I would say I believe he is a martial arts master!
Haha!!! I can listen to this guy all day. There’s something to be said about a person that operated with absolutely no filters or social graces. Very interesting.
nate funny lol , hope he wins tho , needs to work on them straight fast jabs , instead of those slow overhead punches
Nate really fighting more than just khamzat.
Kill or be Killed 💯.  The Realist 🤬
11 to 1 dog? They must smoke more than nate and snoop put together .
Mad respect !
number 1 on trending
Rage against the machine! WAR DIAZ!!!
Gotta love the Diaz boys! These guys lived the fight game. They brought it for every damned fight they were in. I'll miss them both in the UFC. How can you not love Nate after watching this?   Thanks ESPN MMA for this unedited, long form interview with Nate. It's great to get this deeper insight into his mind.
I almost beat up Dana white in the club too Ahahaha you should ask him 🤣🤣🤣🤣Let’s go NATE 💯🫡 nobody tells me what to do 💯 and kumshot say he gangsta. I don’t think so in Nate’s voice
If those guys are the GOATS, then Nate is the GOAT herder

46 6346
I don't think anyone will be happy when and how the fight ends. We want to see the fight but not the consequences of it.
“YOUR WELCOME DUBAI” lmaoooooooo
I love Nate I hope he pulls this off
😂😂😂😂 nate
Used to be a fan of Bret Okamoto not as much anymore
You over here asking permission from the ufc? U ain't no fuk'n champion.
I'M NOT SURPRISED!    NATE'S THE GOAT
I hope Nate goes in there takes a faint punch exaggerates tf out of it and acts knocked out. Fk em all. Take ur $$ Nate
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life. 943
Tomato can diaz will take a beating
You got this Nate you've had bigger hype trains to stop 🛑
this teraphy session ?
“I refuse to be lame!” 😂
Props to Brett for letting Diaz air out the dirty laundry.  No doubt to what he is saying....however, it takes a great reporter to capture these moments. 👍
i love nate but he dont know what tf he talking bout
Someone who is successful and doesnt have a silver tongue is a person who never played politics. Their success has come through undeniable hard work.
Why does this feel like a 60 minutes interview lol
Gotta love hate.. "since I was 17 or 18 it feels like the same month.. but over a longer time period.. you know"
.. i think we all wish we could be a bit like Nate…
He won’t get out the 1st round, 2nd at best
You fought burnzzzz dawg burnzzzzzzz I love u bro
"I made this fool fight you stupid" LOL DIAZ!
This is uncormfortable to watch I think he knows he is going to get killed...
He sounds so drug f...Ed now ..
They should have matched him with Tony Ferguson for his last fight.
“This was a great interview Brett. I gotta go.” Lmao and interview just ends. How can anyone have anything but respect for this guy.
Lmao the way he talks about the other champions, he’s so delusional
I believe Diaz can get the job done ✔  much respect to diaz army
nate is the truth
Nate beats Covid in the ball bag!!
Lmao watch him beat chimazzzz
Nate starting to sound like Mike Tyson.
Love him but he seems so tired and depressed mentally I don’t think he’s ready for this fight
I feel for Nate, he's the champion of the people. Real G. His personality, his character. A true warrior
I really hoe Nate shocks the world, been following him since 2012. Hes real OG and has the best cardio of all time. I donno he grew on me over the years and i want him to win.
Nate is going out on his shield infront of the entire world, and I'm not talking about this fight (he could win) but it's about the damage that's already been done. This guy is a WARRIOR, it's bitter sweet, but nevertheless one of the toughest ever.
Nate Diaz has a whole lot of people behind him!!! Let's go Nate!!!! Shake up the world one more time!!!!
You know what, this is kinda poetic this is like a movie or a show.. khamzat is slowly becoming nate diaz..  khamzat used to see nate once he was young.. but now he going to take him out.. nate realize this is he's fate, this is his ending to his character arc. New players have come to replace him. Its subliminal.
Nate Diaz the biggest the realest super star in the ufc
Nick and Nate need a podcast
I understand the ufc wants to give Khamzat the publicity and love Nate Diaz has but it wouldn’t happen over them fighting. One of the biggest ufc fighters to ever live, his Track record is what led him to the love.
Sound like these ufc cats are bunch of cup 🎂
It's kinda sad. The way he's treated and you can see all he's done has put a tole on his health.
Nate is the realist mfka hands down
At this point I dont know if he does drugs, or drugs do him.
"this was a great interview brad. I have to go" - Nate Diaz (all class)
Stockton Nate Diaz! You're a hero! You will never be a zero to your loyal fans. Win or lose, you will always be my forever favorite to ever be in the game. One day I wish to meet you! Good luck on the 10th! I have faith in the Diaz brothers.
must be 4:20p Nates out!!
With add do respect to Diaz brothers but this just another carnage by Borz
Something is up how Nate is getting all them big names . More $$ , their tryna pay him so he can keep his mouth shut . Maybe a revenge for his brother’s suspension for smoking weed .. Seems sketchy .. they tryna repay him ..
We gonna miss you Nate Dogg!! NDA.
We gonna miss you Nate Dogg!! NDA.
Diaz all the way!!
“If you’re Mr. Goat, then go make a goat”  - the 🐐
🐐
Nate: “you fought burns dawg, you fought BURNS” 😐
“Indian style sitting down ready to listen to the teacher” 🤣🤣💀
RETIREMENT GO HOME FEE ONLY.       diaz washed-out never been a champ  vs high caliber peak Khamzat
He has the Mike Tyson syndrome lol.
Ive never seen a man more sure he’s about to get killed in the octagon.
IM NOT SURPRISED MOTHER FUCKERS
Greatest interview evah...rambling here there and everywhere...hahaa
THE OG 🤙
I wish y’all would stop censoring profanity. We’re all adults here. It really fucks up the flow of the interview. “Oh we can show controlled violence, but the F word is a bad word sorry, can’t let you hear it.”
We have to appreciate this moment.  If this is his last fight that’s 17 years coming to an end this is legendary. Respect Nate I was 5 years old when he started in the ufc and I get to witness his last fight
Nate is the Goat and the biggest OG in the UFC .
Let's fckin Go Nate my hero
WHEN you win nate! Let everyone know once again, IM NOT SARPRISED MF!
So much you could say about Diaz. Legend. Warrior. Tough SOB. He doesn’t gaf he’s just about to get in there and fight one of the most dangerous new fighters we’ve ever seen. And Diaz might just win 🤣
He’s got a bad case of CTE he can barely talk nowadays. Look at how he used to talk. Really sad.
WHY ARE YOUR VIDEOS LITTLE BLURRY MAN.? DONT YOU HAVE HIGH QUALITY CAMERAS?
He seems extra slow and awkward. He's gonna get wrecked.
Beat Nate interview ever
Bunch of nerds 😂😂😂😂😂😂
We still have Nick in the UFC, that's some relief for we the fans... 😄
Gotta love Nate
Diaz will always be my favourite fighter
brett such a smug pos
"If you're a goat then make a goat" the realest quote from nate!
Dude I love nate but saying he basically beat leon is nuts 😂 some of us watched those first 24 mins and not just when you rocked him
Nate you are a real man and I thank you for it.
🇺🇸 USA let’s go Nate !!!!!!
“ITS ABOUT MAKING THIS MAN”
That was a great interview. Nate is the definition of a champion. No need for trinkets or WWE lookalike belts. This is about life and death. The last samurai
CTE
Dude is so stoned he makes no sense and forgets the question 😂 classic Diaz.
I love Nate, but dam he looks like Robert Deniro when he talks. 😆🤣
What's with the interviewer constantly resorting back to "does it feel different to what it did back then?" like he's trying to get him to contradict himself instead of just accepting his answer and moving on
Brought to you by Real Fight, Inc.
All I’m gonna say is: He is the man and life isn’t fair.
nate is already becoming mike tyson status
Tough as nails. I think he's bitter because he could be fighting Jake Paul for millions but Dana still has that leash.
You can do steroids,  I'll smoke weed let's just bang baby!
Let’s go Nate we behind you on this one like we have been from the 559 to the 209 California Love
lmao i know he ain’t say “ill fight n*ggas on steroids”
The best interview Nate has ever given. You really got to feel his energy here.
I like the guy, but he is completely delusional.
South Stockton baby ! Let’s go DIAZ !! 209
Nate makes no sense, yet I fully understand him.
If diaz has an ounce of war diaz left he’d give this his all and try mcgregor 1 khamzat
This has been up for only 12 hrs and has already surpassed the Khamzat interview for yesterday.  Js
Ya boy Nate had some things on his chest that needed gettin off! War DIAZ!!! ✌🏻
Fells like Iron Mike's talking !
All that scar tissue
#1 ON TRENDING!!!
"I refuse to be lame".....
I want this guy to upset the world all over again and sail into the sunset. 💪🏼
Nate is the realest fighter ever. He said he refuses to be lame as a fighter. Díaz army in full effect. Kill or be killed. Let’s go! Motherfucker!
I’m ready for a movie moment… Nate wins, then the whole script changes
My dawg 💪
Gangster
I can see Nate smack khamzat before the fight happens ufc gotta be careful with square up
I love Nate Diaz
Bret “ uh huh” Okamotto
CTE entered the chat
Robert Deniro, Al Pacino, Leonardo DiCaprio and Adam Sandler, 4 best to ever do it
“You fought Burnsss” 🤣🤣💀
Please God help him win.
I love Nate... but he's gonna get massacred
I like how if you're a goat on your way out, you don't fight the goat. You fight your way up and become a goat..  It like a grandpa fighting for years and young buck shows up and say ha I'm the goat I just beat grandpa..
if you got odds against nate bet on him!!!   khamzat hasnt looked that great! just exciting, and people crying about nate fed to wolves, f that too, thats crazy, i wanna see this fight dont you? khamzat wants to scrap
NATE WILL SHOCK THE WORLD BECAUSE HE ALL READY HAS!
lmao the way the does the kamaru impression is actually really good, he just can't continue cuz he starts cringing 🤣🤣🤣
I love that Nate doesn’t even try to pronounce chimaevs name LOL
Diaz will go out blazing, win or lose..glad he didn't have a retard manager like Diego Sanchez or manipulated.
Ummm I need subtitles 🤨
Represent
I don't really care if he wins or if he loses. But this man should not be fighting anymore.
glad that the interviewer let him talk. great monologue of any great play
Man i love nate. I really don't want to see him get hit anymore. Man...
so deep
He has victim syndrome. According to him everyone is out to bring him down and screw him over. Chill bro.
NICK DIAZ ARMY. LET'S GO NATE! 👊 🔥
At this point of the fight he stills smoking weed. He will definitely be smoked
I hope Nate wins.
Your a Gladiator Nate
Diaz!!  🔥🔥🔥🔥
i hope Nate subs him or starts whoopin hamzats tail in the later rounds
30:57 "Dana was all petho" for those who don't speak Spanish this means he was drunk
We love you Nate
God this audio is terrible, nearly unwatchable
I will not be shocked when Nate wins. He will always be the peoples champ.
This felt a lot like his brothers interview for his last fight..😩
LEGEND!  Diaz Army Represent
I'm not surprised motherfuckers! Just want to hear that one more time before I die
Gracie never gets spoken of when it comes to the greats shout out nate he definitely has a shot at winning Saturday night
🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐
Nate pain really got me sad eyes never lie
“This was a great interview Brett I have to go” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I was never really a Nate fan, but I hope he wins in spectacular fashion this weekend.

Win or lose, nates hairline is undefeated.
This one is gonna be a banger can’t miss
Win big, Nate. Wishing you the best, brother.
I fuk with nate but My boy nate need a translator 😆
THATS RIGHT NATE!!
Wealth and weed are bad combination
Nick and Charlie z are the goats
He's amazing.
Nate Diaz is the people's Champ! Win or Lose, always behind Nate Diaz💯💯💯💯👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽
Diaz.
Why the host wears a shirt like 2 sizes smaller? Did he wash it at 90 degrees?
The most humbled way he responded about Jon Jones says alot
I hope he wins, gets the respect he deserves and retires a happier man! I have so much respect for this warrior.
why limit 720p? shitty espn
Nate is BEAST, I hope he wins sept 10th, Haters sleep
Nate will get out of there quick, he could care less
Hi, i wanna get reply...
God bless you Nate.😎
NO FAT NO FLUFF NATE DIAZ
I love the Diaz logic
awesome
This will be the last fight! I predicted that Khamzat Chimaev will win and Nate Diaz will lose!
"If you're Mr g.o.a.t, then make a goat" - Nate Diaz, 2022
This reminds me of tupacs vibe magazine 96 interview. Nate dogg is a real doggg! Real fc ! 🩸💪
is it me or is the quality of videos kinda buggin
Hold up did Nate say “I’m willing to fight n*ggas  on steroids” lmaoooo 💀
Tooo many hits to the head, or... Something isn't right in his head! I love Nate, but.. he's definitely not a people person!! You can tell he didn't want to do this interview!!
Diaz got a point about the machine pushing their fighters and calling them the greatest but, it feels a bit disrespectful not to recognize the amazing talent and hall of famers that we have still fighting right now.
Nate & Nick always keeping it 100!
I love Nate  but this  is hard, he isn't fully there. I know he tales shots for a living, I had  no idea it was like this. I hope he hangs them up, enjoy his family, trains fighters at his gym.   I wish him the best
Don't care who I offend! Nate and Nick will be the Ali of MMA.. Nate is on a another level and mindset! I believe he can and WILL upset the world Saturday
LETS GO NATE🫡🫡
Nate is a badasssssss
Nate, always real! It is a pity that this is the last fight I hope the world will be in shock🤞🏼 Nate Diaz deserves more respect 🫡
omg Nate's impersonation of Usman lolololol @ 9:50😂 😂
Wow #1 on trending?😢
People will not miss Nate Diaz's delusional rants on always being the uncrowned champion. He literally lost a belt Dana designed for him, The Baddest Motherfucker Belt (BMF). He couldn't even earn his own hand out.
Love you nate!
Bret put me to sleep fast how does he still have a job
Time to shock the world again Nate! I won't be surprised motherfuckers!!!
Man I’ve been a fan day one! I love Diaz win lose or draw ! It’s going to be weird with out you!! Diaz army!!
"This was a great interview brad, I've to go" Great ending🤣🤣  Nate is soo true
Mumbling at its finest...
Won’t past R1
Nate Diaz is the People's Champion!
NATE DROPS A HUGE "N" BOMB @ 23:57 lmao....Im a black man and im not offended at all he has a lifetime pass!!!!
Jon Jones ''WHO?'' 23:30
Nate is a people's champion that's most important
Nate Diaz for life don’t even know him but I feel him like he was my family
..." no one's telling me what to do...ever.."
Khamzat will crush this guy worse than an empty can and I can't wait for it.
Diaz!
Nate great person
Nate Diaz is going to shock the world let's go
Nate is the true definition of a prize fighter… he’s fought for a living for money, not for a belt! I totally respect it when he says he never did anything he didn’t want to do! But I do kinda feel like he didn’t wanna do this fight against Khamzat but he’s doing it anyways to just bc he is ready to have his contract ended an doesn’t want to wait. Can’t say I blame him for that though. He’s not getting any younger. I’ll watch him fight no matter when, where & no matter who! I’m a ride or die fan no matter what! There’s only a couple fighters I would say that about to!!!
209 all the time
Nate wanting to fight Francis absolutely established him as the GOAT
9:33
Thank you for your career Nate. So many moments of greatness and memories. Seeing you hold the tears back shows your heart in this game and your passion. Your last fight should have been with Tony, Two legends towards the end of their time in the cage. It's ok to let go regardless of the outcome of this fight. Dana couldn't have been more disrespectful with this decision. Is what it is. Best wishes no matter what happens. Your a true fighter.
Still waiting on Nate’s point …
These interviews make me miss Helwani
Orale compa, puro ninja 🥷
Nate Diaz army man we trending number1 right now
This is why we love Nate, nothing but truth.
Biggest Diaz bros hater right here and I even Im pulling for Nate.I grew up watching Nick and Nate fight , true pioneers
I work night shifts so I’m listening and not watching… All I can say is it’s always pleasure listening to the Diaz brothers speak. Rooting for him ima bet a good 20 on him haha
He's cooked 😅 Don't know if it's a good idea to indulge in that much weed just a few days before a fight with a guy who is totally sober and training like a maniac.
Super Stoned! Its over folks! Nate coming in out of shape! Sad as ph u k. NATE gonna last 2 rds over.
I refuse to be lame 🤣
I'm an oldie , been around since UFC 1 and also I used to watch a ton of boxing......saw Muhammad Ali fight live and I remember the vibe of the boxing fans , peers , Press and even his own team around the destroyer , George Foreman on " the Rumble in the Jungle " upcoming fight. Everyone was afraid for Ali....enter Diaz . I hope the result is the same as Ali's.
100
Brett's so bad that Nate had to ask and answer his own questions And end his own interview hahah
You see Nate Diaz's sadness in realizing he will never become a champion. His way of finding peace with this realization is through denial, arguing that he fought for his homies and blaming the results on his inability on attaining a belt, on the UFC Machine. Although fighters like Connor McGregor and Chael Sonnen have been placed in front of the line from the machine for their promotional ability, it still does not change the results of this sport, the best man always rises to the top. Shame on people like Nate and Makhachev for talking down on Charles Olivera when Charles exemplifies the heart of a true champion. Charles rose to the top after massive setbacks and holds the belt. Nate...you may be the people's champion and a "bro" but do not convolute reality, besides, no man over the age of like 20 looks cool making his homies his world, that is so childish and sad. Nonetheless best wishes this weekend...I'm rooting for the upset and hope you retire on a win. People will not miss Nate Diaz's delusional rants on being a champion.
espn is so soft silencing curse words they ruin sports
That's how you interview yourself, man😂😂
If you love MMA You want Nate Diaz to win Saturday   Don't want him to leave man I think he will be missed by us all if this is his final UFC fight. If he wins he getting Leon Edwards rematch for the title  COME ON NATE DIAZ
Nate comment on Burns had me rolling 🤣." I made you fight this foo stupid"
"I'm not surprised mother f#%kers!" ~ Nate Diaz 😎
Great video 🦉
He should have fought Connor Mc Gregor for his final fight
I got Nate west coast motherfuckers
Nate is going to win 4th round watch
Nate always ends his own interviews, he's 1 of 1 lol
Love you Nate 🙌🏽 y
This is amazing. Nate Diaz is a pioneer.
He's real
Brad Okamoto. Great guy.
I wish they subtitled everything nate does
Nate's a street dog
his personality is the white mike tyson of mma
Best ufc interview
Nate is the 🐐
Had to turn the subtitles on for this one 💀
It would be nice if they didn't censor bad language, we are all adults here.
Fan favorite inside the cage, GOAT outside
My most favorite ufc fighter. Love him and Cain   Velásquez. Ultime best.
This was a great interview brett,I have to go. Boss
Punch drunk??
Nate is the MAN
These people in Dubai and the Middle East need to remember the Crusades and we're the truth Warriors came.from . And build their Sandcastles somewhere else leave Nate the UFC is a sham it's just there for political relations which should not matter we owe them nothing
He’s making some strong points here
Dude was out if shape last fight, lets hope he puts the work in this time..winnable fight if Nate is in top shape..will loose if he comes in like last fight..take it seriously and train bro..guts and heart ain't enough..
I'm no Diaz fan at all but I hope Nate wins because I love a good upset and love when an underdog prevails. Hope Nate derails the Chimaev train.
I Love Nate 😂
The worlds with Nate
Nate’s too tough for his own good
We will definitely look back in 10 years and see that this is a legendary interview.
He’s high af
I hope Nate wins, not the biggest fan and I think a lot of the stuff he said here was absolute BS but it's Nate so it is what it is. He's got my respect for being willing yo fight anyone
Got into 33 minutes and started thinking if there was a part 2. But then Diaz ended it in Diaz fashion. Boom.
Nate telling it like it is , love that guy by far my favorite fighter with out a doubt .
Nate's far from the best fighter in the UFC, but he's right about everything else about the UFC and how it works.💯
Nate’s gonna knock/choke out that Russian POS Mexican pride baby!! Stockton All Day and if I get censored that proves YouTube is racist!!!
He’s punch drunk. Need to know when to hang it up before your faculties are damaged. Judging by his speech. He’s already showing signs of permanent damage.
720p and low audio. This is embarrassing for ESPN's official MMA channel.
Win or lose, Nate wins.
Painful to listen to. Rambling braindead zombie. Glad hes gone after this fight
21:14 - 21:18 dayum
Nate smokes all his brain cells away
Loose or win Nate and nick will always be the top Gangster of the UFC
Loose or win Nate and nick will always be the top Gangster of the UFC
amazing interview lol
Nate is saying that the champion hasn't been the best fighter in a very long time. And he's 100% right. One Championship has better fights where the best fighters fight each other more often, and few bad decisions. UFC is the McDonald's of MMA. It's the biggest, but it's bad for the sport bc it's corrupt. 💯💯
This dude better win lmao I’ve been waiting for that W being a Fan.
Win or lose but we want a Nate dais moment in the fight
No Nate, everyone is not saying you're going to get stomped out. The real mf'ers know what's up!!
Nate seems like he’s on drugs
Respect Diaz
Stay off the weed, after this weekend you will have 15 losses.  Agree with him about Juicehead Jon, he’s a disgrace.
720p???? ESPN is this a video for ants?   Edit: The longer I watch the more horrible the quality looks. ESPN step it up.
This a real mfer, no doubt. However I can say confidently Nate is showing early advance stages of brain damage. I’m really hoping khamzat doesn’t murk him to bad. Honestly.
This is an odd interview
no matter what all respect to nate 👊🏼💯 straight up G 🥷
im a conor fan but im a nate fan too. thats a bad mf. pretty wack how the ufc is doing him right now but i would like to see him shock the world on Saturday.
Best interview ever Edit: "you do steroids I smoke weed, now let's get in there and squab" love it
Lets go Nate!
Just like his brother, threw his career away. for a 21-13 fighter he did well for himself. But as of now, he isn;t even a has been. He is a never was
Big dog
HE's sooo Highhhh
Díaz 💯
Dana did him wrong with this matchup.
NATE DIAZ NATION... NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR THE DIAZ BROTHERS. FEW FIGHTERS HAVE HAD CAREERS LIKE THERES AND KEPT IT 100% REAL THE ENTIRE TIME. BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CAGE. THEY HELPED CHANGE THE GAME N NEVER LET THE GAME CHANGE THEM.

Nate is a OG Love and Respect Always!!!
That was absolute gold
Ufc hates hispanics period.
Who interviewed who? 😂
nate not name،nate is lifestyle 🤌🏾👌🏾♥️
They should have did Nate versus Tony or Nate versus Connor 3 or Dustin
''Camaro he's acting like the GOAT'   -Nate Diaz
He wins no matter what
Branding himself. Putting his name in the hat. New champ if he wins this fight
I hate how they censor Nate Diaz’s language…. If you don’t like it don’t interview him
15 years in the UFC and no belt...
He shouldn't be fighting Idk how this fight is allowed to happen. His speech has been declining rapidly! Let's petition to stop this!! 5000 likes lets go!!!!!
Nate can't stand sitting across from this guy .. you can tell
SHOUDLA WORKED ON A COMPUTER SOMEWHERE YA NERD
Nate is in a scary frame of mind
"It don't feel right if it's not happening." - Perfectly sums up Nate Diaz.
Can we get Mike Tyson and Nate in the same room with a interview   Very deep?
I agree with everything Nate said, EXCEPT about the best UFC fighter. The best is CM Punk.
Why do all questions sound the same!? 'Feel like this' 'Feel like that'. These journalists be lazy.
Nate is pissed
So pure. Unadulterated. Incisive.
#1 on trending. 💪
One word - diogenes
Stockton is a straight up dump.
The interviewer is a fool for speaking to the guest in that manner. Can you not read the atmosphere and body language but you insist on being assertive and dominant with your crossed legged confident self you little tool. I don’t care if you know Nate, have some respect
Nate Diaz 👊👊👊
Win Nate!!! Win
heyo
Nate probably owns the best ufc moment. Submitting the best star in sports history. The notorious
Brett is so patient lol
Nate is one of the goats for sure!!!!
Nate my guy. Hope he can do it one more time. Just to take the fight was a G moment this guy is don
I remember watching that striking clinic Live he put on Michael Johnson, then gave a little speech that changed the game forever 💯👊🏽
Bro you are the Goat. You beat there golden boy Mcgregor!! TWICE in my Opinion .  I think you won the 2nd fight too.
man i feel your words nate. ride with u thru thick and thin.. win or lose. be a fan forever. just because of who u are and how real u kept it. respect always
I’d pay top money to listen to Kanye west and Nathan Diaz having a one hour conversation.
I don't know why but I feel sorry for him
He’s emotionally broken cuz he did sooo much and don’t get the respect. He wants the clout but he did get beat. UFC is feeding him to khazmat
Nate Diaz is making a homage to his bro Nick Diaz when he fought Anderson Silva. Two of The toughest , most badass Brothers, real fighters. Respect 💯
Nate is slowly turning into Nick
Mad respect for the love this man has for his brother.
Bret trying hard to look comfortable
Watching this interview I can’t help but think and see the comparisons of Tyson interviews. Nate shows signs of extreme pain talking about his career and i worry for his brain health. I hope regardless of what happens on Saturday he retires and lives a healthy rest of his life.
Nate .DIAZ ! DA REALIST IN THE GAME 100
The same sports bet ad every 2 minutes made this hard to watch
The best element about this elite sport is that anything can happen • MMA • Diaz shows up
Stockton slap gonna sleep the wolf
I'm not surprised.
i lose braincells listening to date niaz
Seen a lot of fighter interviews over the years. This one is a moment. Well done and thanks.
This interview would’ve much better if Bret would just wear a tighter shirt
khamsat corner will have him stand, it will be crazy
I don’t think Nate truly understands how impactful he is for us underdogs. Love you bro. You matter to so many people. Let your guard down when it’s all said and done and enjoy your life to the fullest. You deserve it
this make me appreciate  ARIEL HELWANI MORE THEN EVER
Nate Diaz never loses, he just runs out of time.
nate be the man goat level Clowning if  not a believer
Brett sounds like a therapist as always when interviewing Nathan.
Nate under these circumstances is very dangerous. He is very desperate of the situation that he might actually pull it off. He has the skills and mentality for it but we will see if Khamzat can tame him. Can’t wait for that fight
I like Diaz and all don't get me wrong but if he really he really thinks he's "the best ufc fighter ever" this MF really needs a head check
I hope Nate finishes him with ease! 🤘🏽
Nate “I don’t even give a fu*k” Diaz
Dude can barely even talk....
I’m not surprised mf!
The way he ended the interview tho!!!  Only a certified GOAT can do that so smooth and effortless!
Nates always been the realist 💯be gettin hated on for no reason
that's right Nate you a real one
Ufc is f'd for doing this to Nate Diaz.
Some faded comments but I respect because it is real and even if slightly faded he has legit reasons for those feelings. Mad respect... Just letting Nate go in this interview was honestly amazing. Everyone always hits Nate for his intelligence because of the way he talks. But he actually says some very intelligent mature things here in bits and pieces. Mad respect, OG and definitely one of the baddest to ever do it.
“I refuse to be lame”
I respect Nate but I think the signs of knocks to the heads are really showing.
Diaz said “I’ve been at war for a long time” he was crying for help
Nate is toast
Nate’s already talking about when he loses. This is not going to be good for him. Seems like he’s already accepted defeat.
He on drugs bad!! You can see his mannerisms always touching his nose. He gonna lose bad. Love em but he shouldn’t do it.
Nate might fall thousand times get knocked out 1000 thousand times Nate might get his face hurt full of blood he still fight untill his last breath with anyone  anywhere anytime even he get offered to fight with lion he won't say no that kind of big heart he have that's why he is different from others and even loosing one after another he have so many fans and tune to watch his fight...
Nate you are the Champion of champions there’s no need for a belt!
Much respect to Nate for always bigging up his brother Nick as the greatest. I truly hope Nate wins if he does I feel like it will have to be a submission. Unless he can tire out Khazmat and put a 3 piece on him. I wish the UFC would let both out of contracts they would be champs in ONE or Bellator. Diaz Army 4 Life 💪
Anyone who keeps it real 100% of the time is king of earth but this man is the king of kings.                       👑✊👑✊👑✊👑✊👑✊
21:27
All respect for nate.. but watch an early interview of him talking til now.. all the wars he's been in! When he talks it's out the right side of his mouth! Like he lost feeling on the left side! Tough to hear n see!
“This fight isn’t even about this guy. It’s about making this guy.” Impressive insight.
Ending made me laugh, "I have to go". Diaz is a g!
I thought it was Aaron Hernandez for a sec
My man may have some early signs of cte..
All I heard is complaining....not a gangster just a winger .. I see a dead man walking
Hope you win nate would love to see you get the dub
Edit out those cuss words thanks🙄🙄👎
Nate Wasnt trying to step on any toes in his prime out of respect. Nates a real 1 gotta respect the G for who he is.
I love watching his fights.
I can’t understand anything he said in this.. he speaks like a drunk politician.
Someone meme the "where's the facts?" 16:27
This is why we love Diaz!! The motherfuckin OG!!
COME ON NATE, YOU GOT THIS...... IF FOR SOME REASON YOU DON'T, WE STILL LOVE AND RESPECT YOU
I love Nate, but I bet he gets cut and ends with a Dr Stoppage.
"He fought Burns, dawg. He fought BURNS." funniest Diaz quote to date
8:57 "narrative" maybe?
I have a feeling us ufc fans are going to get a shock but not the way you think. I unfortunately think Diaz is going to get hurt very very badly 😢  too much too late im afraid.
I feel as if this is nates best interview hes done. He really laid it all on the table. I hope to see a win. Shock the world. Much respect and love to the diaz army
Nate ain’t got anything to loose and that’s why I feel like he’s going to shock the world
This interview makes me grateful. However do us all a favor and have the sound engineer triple the f****** volume !!!!
He is correct about one thing, there were weird vibes with early ultimate fighter episodes, you had Dana White come in often all angry and the fighters would all look subservient at the ground like they were little kids in school in trouble. That was some of the weirdest stuff I have ever seen, I agree with Nate that it would be ridiculous to behave like a child being scolded when you are an adult man and Dana White is hardly scary, the behaviour of most ultimate fighter guys was totally weak mentally.
“You do steroids, I smoke weed & let’s get in there & squab idgaf”
Feels like your interviewing  a mafia boss😆😎
Nate is gonna shock the world and gonna go out with a bang 🖕🏼
Sad to see how Diaz talks now.  All fighting sports should be banned
Brett made this interview so cringe. Awful
Love you Nate. You’re my hero
Nate!!! Go to bed and stop smoking . Your not making any sense right now.
At brawling u got it he will go fir take downs u can do it drag it out make him fight u goodluck bro u got this
He is keeping it real
Nates a legend
i still remember nate on TUF and one the guys in the house was being a bully to him. Watched him his whole career.. have yet to miss any of his fights. i pulled up his career earnings. Ufc did take care of nate.. each fight they kept on bumping up his pay then bumping up his pay.. compared to alot of other fighters.. yeh nate did well he was taken cared of and not deserve but earnt every bit of it even more. ufc will never pay nate enuff!
"I refuse to be lame" -nate diaz
we love you champ lets go shook the world
Nate is and will always be the realest
I like Nate but this man just saying anything and everything that is on his mind. No structure just random rambling. And going on random rants. Couldn’t follow along to well lol
Sooo HIGH ALL THE TYNE
Nate done lost his mind.  Spoken like a bitter man who never made it to the big dance so he hatin on all the champs
The facts the UFC has been ducking and dodging this guy for years blows my mind. He’s speaking facts about the Rankings and everyone claiming Goat Status whilst having fought just a few top 10/5 guys. Nate has been doing that and then some and the UFC still doesnt push him on a path to hold a Title. Cause he doesnt “fit” their Mold. He’s Against the Grain! Respect.
“This was a great interview, Bret. But I gotta go” 😂😂😂 GOAT
DIAZ ARMY
Poor quality audio
Honestly never cared for ufc until I watched Nate choke Connor, and after this fight ill only watch Nate rather he wins or loses. Good luck!
Stockton california proud
Adam Sandler as a most famous actor? Hahahaha. What a joker
Doesn't surprise me Nate is fighting khamzat. He fought Masvidal when Masvidal was at his scariest after knocking out till and his last fight against askren. He will fight anyone
Nate!
GREAT INTERVIEW
That was the best interview I have ever seen, period.  Leave it to Nate Diaz, a 4 STAR general in the Nick Diaz ARMY Time to shock the world again, Nate Dog
this interviewer sucks. how many times does Diaz have to tell him it’s all the same before he gets it?
never got lined up for a title fight? What happened against Benson Henderson then? Losing 5 out of 9 fights. Lost to a smaller RDA. Win those fights and you get a title. UFC don't care if you look like a model. Khamzat is lanky with a busted lip. Khabib built like a neanderthal. If you can fight good and sell tickets, why wouldn't they want you as champ?
New Zealand is w you Nate!
720p... come on espn...
Who stroked his ego?
Respect.
Just me or does Nate sound like he’s hurting?
NATE DIAZ By DARCY IN THE 3RD
NATE DIAZ ARMY MOTHERFUCKERS!!!
Dudes with a soft tone and lisp are terrifying
Brett the best in the game
Drag him in the deep water Nate and beat the brakes off that dude
Nate Diaz Army. Love this sport. What Nate was talking about Robert DeNiro thing. It's because real alpha males stand out. Especially when they are the elite fighters in the world. Best Sport next to hockey in the world. Of course violence with manners goes back to the coliseum days. Humans are stimulated by violence. Not all but I have seen humans act non human. All from getting caught up in the frenzy of violence. Especially stupid humans. Humans intelligence drops significantly when they are in crowds.
Imagine Nates army vs the UFC fuuuhhhhkkkkk 🫣💯🔥 lmao whos top 5 right now... yea ill fight all of them in 5 secs 😂💯
Realest as it gets! Let's go TEAM DIAZ!!!!
fuckig love nate man, dont agree with all but im not telling him lol and still love him
He punvh drunk  he said  Adendanya got sleot by leon edwards   , even though that was Usman
Brett: So why you think they're putting you up against Khamzat for your last fight? Nate: Imagine you saw BJ Penn at the mall
Whether you support this man or not, you have to stop being delusional and look at the bigger picture. This man has horrible CTE and can baraly form a proper sentence. It's pretty sad if you ask me. Nate needs to stop fighting.
This guy looks like he is 50 years old
Never change Nate! 💪🏾💪🏾
how many drinks 🍸
Win or Lose  When this guy Beat Loud Mouth McShitter,,,  Diaz became almost like a Hero to me.. 🇲🇽 🇺🇸
Diaz has loses in the sport game but if we really look at the loses, nobody has broken him and if  there was no rounds, Diaz would of won them fights,he never stop big heart great fighter
It ain't Nate Diaz vs The World if I believe in him💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
I will support Nate and nick until the day I die
21:57 is hilarious. Nate acting like the UFC wants model citizens to be champ. They literally moved an event for Jon Alcoholic Wife Beater Jones and still have Conor in the LW rankings even though he hasn't won a LW fight in 6 years.
Nate is a real fighter he really is down for whatever. Respect to the last of a dying breed.
Nate is my dawg for life always a fan here
sounds like this guys not so right in the head?
People need to put some Respect on this man's name. You will never see another fighter who's as REAL as Nate Diaz.. He is a  True Warrior. Now go take Khamzats soul and ride off into the sunset .
If you wanna laugh a little just turn on the subtitles 😀
Nate gonna retire....
Nate is beyond HIGH
Nate forgot that even he was once popped by USADA. I was shocked when that happened. But you never know.....There is a constant risk of trace amounts of the wrong thing being in something you consume. USADA's testing has become so advanced that even the slightest mistake takes you out of competition for years.
He can barely speak english. Seriously. Punch drunk and stoned. What a joke. Stuck in the old school mate. The old school best are no longer the best.
All white people root for Nate. Simple as that.
Nate Diaz is 🐐… I believe hes going into this fight with more hatred and heat than with Mcgregor. Chimaev better watchout.
You do steroids and I’ll smoke some weed and let’s squab 👀
What ?
I really hope he's going to win. The odds are against him. He's gotta finish him and not play around. If he would have got on Leon after hurting him he would have won.  He is a warrior in my book. I wish him the best.
this 720p looks like 144p from the 90's.
Even if Nate loses to whatever other dudes name is I still wouldn’t care to see that dude fight just cause he beat Nate idk why they think this is going to make the other dude more popular smh
Respect to my man we love uu from your debut and until your last fight 209 4L ‼️ hope uu shock the world once more nate 🖤
Nate is the people champion.
3:15  "pshh since i was like 17 / 18 everything feels like its in the same month" I lost it lmao
Nate really didn't want Chimiev smoke. I don't blame him.
this man known the fight game. he is much smarter than he is given credit. my $ on Nate in the 4th via sub
Love nate but it sad to see he doesn't want this you can see the CTE coming on
You know he on a diff level when you watch the whole interview 🤷🏽‍♂️
Everyone remember while listening to this interview that Nate has taken A LOT of punches to the head! Be easy on him! Lol
Nate destroyed Kimura Snoozeman 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lets go Brother !!!!! You got this
‘If you’re a true GOAT make a GOAT’ classic Diaz quote
Big Nate fan...but I got to be honest here...Nate seems a little punch drunk...he went on crazy tangents to simple questions...seems like he's trying to make everyone believe who he is...
He looks more like nick as he gets older lol.
Nate Dias e chamado aqui no Brasil como Calango elétrico, na torcida por vc irmão oss.
NATEE DIAZZZZZZZZZZ
Homie looked like he was ready to cry the entire interview
He’s starting to look more like Nick
Everyone is saying Nate is gonna lose but I don't think he will.  This is a shittty match up to begin with but Nates got this 👍
He shocked the world with Connor. It’s his MO. Can’t wait for this fight
This interview feels like they are interviewing a prisoner before the electric chair
"Pressure is on you mf"😆😆😂😂😆😂real talk💯
Is kind of messed up talking about steroids when half his team tested positive for them. Love Nate but he sounds a little delusional here
Pongan le subtítulos
FIGHTER
Nate is definitely the champion of the UFC.
He's depressed 😔
The Diaz brothers are true character,they just follow life,no one to impress, just doing what they wanted to do
Its goin to be Brawl of a fight!!..go Nate from the 209!
They should have Nate fight a lot more often cause he can draw crowds like no other and he’s pure entertainment and he’s a warrior that will bang it up with anyone anytime anywhere.
Diaz by submission, calling it.
Sports bet adds are annoying
Team Diaz👊👊👍
Same thing that happened to Nick is happening to Nate now.
Nate for president 2024!! makes more sense than Biden. Hall of fame for sure..
who uploaded this video 720p come on ESPN
Let’s go Nate!!!!
22:33 I can see Sir Pictogram Jones crying on twitter shortly. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bunch of nerds 🤣💀👌
Nate literally spitting FACTS and exposing UFC.
Get it Nate! Can’t wait to see you fight live at my first ufc night. Five rounds you got this boyyy
Nate Diaz folks !
Nate is an outlaw. I love this dude
Nate is the man
I don’t care for who’s popular or who’s the champion, Nate Diaz is the UFC
what's up with the low quality video? ESPN cutting on budget or what, looks like 240p.
Let's gooo nate
Let's go Nate Diaz Army!!!!!
WEST COAST CHAMP..NOR-CAL PRIDE💯💪😎SHOUT OUT TO ALL NORTHERN RAZA FROM THE BIG BAD 209 STOCKTON CALIFAS✌️😎
I agree steroids users shouldn't be included
Love you Nate, respect 209
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
I have never ever seen Nate being so emotional. Thank you Nate for everything. Hope You do well.
Really makes me lose so much respect for the UFC how they've been doing Nate. Someone who brought so much to the sport just to go out to build off a new upcoming fighter.
Facts, True Martial Artist and Warrior. Not hear to discuss stats or who broke records, its last man standing and Nate is still here.
Nathaniel you da man.
Nate has a cool attitude but foes he have a mental disability, the way he speaks is very odd
Don’t worry Nate, khamzat will finish you. Possibly in 1 rnd
Dnt forget that jab!
I hope nate taps another one of Dana's golden boys and then gets with fighters like Francis Ngannou,  jon jones, and probably gang of other fighters unhappy with pay and contracts and either start a business or collaborate as a group and you can create competition to take down the ufc politics.
the rest is history
Didn’t understand one thing he was trying to say. But he’s still a gangsta!
Can we get someone better to interview Nate... this isn't the guy for the job
Nate is the champ, he’s got this mf 💀
Very worried Nate might have CTE
"You do steroids, I'll smoke weed. Let's get in there and squab".  Nathan Donald Diaz
“You do steroids, I smoke weed…let’s just get in there and squabble” 😂
He's the champion of Stockton California, and to him that's the only thing that matters.
Nate Diaz Final Round via TKO
He wants this fight but he didn’t… any clarification?
Everyone has like 5 years as career in ufc that's facts..
They did a terrible job with the audio. It’s very low lol
GJ Brett!
its true dam true man !!!!!
Come on Nate. End this dude. Ride into the sunset, blunt in mouth. Turbocharger down low. You got this brutha. Win lose or draw we got you.
Bret: mmmhm
He sounds tired... Sad... Maybe it's just the fight week grind. But it's hard not to view this as some sort of swan song.
I had to brush up a bit on my Diaz talk as I'm a bit outta practice, lol. 209 HOMIE
You do steroids I smoke weed let’s get on hahahah
"It's not feel right if it's not happening" warrior's mentality 🔥
Phenomenally evocatively refreshing interview
Name another fighter that would end and interviewed like Nate Diaz. He just proved his point, he does whatever he wants.
Nothing but respect for Nate!
He really is a fighters fighter one of the best to ever do it and still going NDA ARMY WAR DIAZ ®️💯🩸👊🏼
Diaz brothers are Goats 🐐💯
This man going to night night ratlips 💯
Ufc did this man extremely dirty.
NATE SOUNDS LIKE HE JUST SMOKED THE WHOLE FOREST
Nate’s interview has more views in less than 24 hours than khmxasts so we’re behind u Nate! You got this brother!
Does anyone know how I can place a bet on Nate from California?
lets not post this video in anything other than 720p - nice work ESPN
I get Nate! And he is right in what he said. UFC just use the fighter like slave.
Nate Diaz the real G and the real fighter 💯👊
“Pressures on you” true
This reminds me of a therapy session
Nate Diaz: I refuse to be lame!
Nate "Where's your facts?" Diaz 😂 straight up G
My man Diaz i wanna meet ya man you are awesome i wanna try some of ur bud pass n puff puff 🙏🙏👍🏻👍🏻❤✌✌
They will only give him his flowers till he is dead
nate 100% for life
They should gave nate chandler or Dustin
Nate to me feels like Dana's sacrificial lamb. Dana gonna get one last big payday out of Nate so Khamzat it is.
I think nate can knock him out in the first or fifth round 😂😂😂
Grave
You are a great person Nate!
UFC disgust me never getting a Penny from me, but I'll buy nates first fight when he gets his release
I thought Nate Diaz hates interviewing with that Ariel guy
Tell em how it is Champ!!!
Nate is getting destroyed
Bro sounds old and drunk
Nate Diaz should be in the UFC hall-of-fame if not I'm done with UFC.
209 rnc!
We love you Nate!! 209🦍
Bro nate ull always be the best fighter in the world for me... nick too u boys are the best in the business I'll always love u and ur styles thanks for all uve done forreal u boys have shaped the world of mma...
Nate vs Everyone
King Nate! 💯
I won't be surprised.
Bang Nate!💯
Nate’s Usman impression wasn’t half bad 😂
Maybe my favorite athlete ever, any sport
This is why they (the ufc) don’t like Nate,  talking facts never goes down well.
"Jon jones" "If you do steroids out of the question”
That’s why you got slept by Leon edwards you play fighting dawg 🤣 this man is the truth
Ariel > Brett . With all due respect
Nate Nate Nate Nate Nate!!!!!
Nate’s the goat but I swear his on shrooms 😂
I really hope Nate pulls it off and get the victory
I'm feeling Mike Tyson vibes..Respect!
Shades come off @10:09
Where is ARIEL HELWANI
You can see the pain in his eyes. Respect bro…Respect 💯💯💯✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
And just like Nate Diaz style.... he ends the interview on HIS TERMS!🖕💪😛
I never noticed how old he is looking until this interview, man..... that's crazy, I was a kid watching Nick Diaz (My all time favorite fighter!!!). I want Nate to pull off a freaking miracle against Chimaev so bad. I am realistic and I know how it should turn out, but, man, I can dream.
If you're not a Diaz fan, are you even really a fan of MMA?
nates been fighting for like 15 yrs pro.....hes at the end now
Ngl this ufc vs nate thing feels like that cm punk era pls let it end the Same
Close your eyes and you'd feel like Mike Tyson is speaking That being said, what a frickin awesome interview
LEGEND.
Nate’s the peoples goat!
Hard to listen to, brain mush from too much weed or too many shots ?  I hope he wins though, khamzat seems a massive douche at least nate is real.
You know what I’m saying
this should’ve been uncensored
WAR DIAZ!!!!!!!
Can’t even imagine trying to read a transcript of this interview. 🤯
Thank you for everything over the years nate diaz
Quality sucks
Nate is an 🇺🇸 badass. A real one.
This man needs to retire now./ many fights ago. No hate he just has way too much damage done to his head. Too tough for his own good like many legends before him
What Nate is saying is. In all his time here no one can beat him, AND HES RIGHT. In his mind you have to be able to beat somone in a fight to be champ. If you take away the time limets and " cut " rules Nate wins against All of his opponents except ONE. HE IS CHAMP CHAMP.
Nate is the best ever people sleep on him because of his record
My cte is just if not worse than this foos at early 20s lol
DiazArmy🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nate wants to make his own promotion, catch Conor off his contract and do the trilogy on his promotion with both them making 100 milly without the ufc in their pockets.
I'm grateful Nate is still fighting. It will suck when he retires
Nate interviewed himself and ended it himself true GOAT 😂
Legend Nick and Nate
Anyone else confused after listening???
Nate is simply a master of his craft 🙌
This feels like a stepfather/ teacher/ psychologist trying to bond with a troubled kid
Nate Diaz, "The REALEST Fighter"
The man, the myth, the legend…win or lose, what a fighter should be
The Peoples GOAT! Oh As Diaz said steroids takes a fighter from goat list… Now we know Brady is a cheater that isn’t a goat.
Come one Brett you got to brush up on your MMA history bro
Shock the world NATE 💪🏼
Some rough 720p
1 on trending
Imho, I think this is Nates last fight. I absolutlely think he's getting out wrestled for 5 rounds.
He knows he's being fed to a wolf.
As of below and then some;)
Hillarious
I hope it goes this distance. God bless Nate, hope he comes out of this ok.
Nates interview got way more views in 10hrs then khamzat in 1 day
Most understandable incoherent interview ever, let’s go Nate!  Also thanks for not making have to listen to Brett talk chaaaa

WE ALWAYS GONE RIDE FOR NATE !
“It feels like it has many of times.” Cold af.
im not surprised.
Always wants the hardest challenge possible. Respect.
Nate is going to shock the world. Put your money on it boys, and trust the power of God, He directs Mars. 💯
I was on Wall Street in downtown Orlando one night getting ready to walk home and I turned around and it was Nate Diaz and one of his homeboys. I hollered at him and they looked like they were ready to fight. Dude is ready at every moment. But he was a cool dude. Took a picture with him and went on my way.
Just hear me out.. what if Nate pulls it off.
Nate will shock the world again

If I’m Nate I walk in there shoot kamzat a bird tell ref I tap out shoot Dana bird and go get paid we know you not gonna get stopped out Nate
If Nate wins he should give ufc the finger n leave. They never believed in him at all.  They gave him a hungry fighter to give him the finger for not signing. Nate great career what’s next?
Why doesn't Nate have cauliflower ears?
Apparently ESPN doesn't have anything better than an iPhone 4 to shoot this interview with.
Just me or.. nate sounds just like Mike tyson here.  ...not prime Mike but, when Mike had a spinal?    Good luck pal! Routing for ya!
awesome
I fell out of my bed laughing at Nate's take on Jon Jones at 23:35 😂🤣😭😂🤣 What a savage
Interviewing nate is like Interviewing a five year old.
The UFC is about to let T.J dillashaw fight for the title after openly admitting to using steroids. But they refuse to give Nate Diaz an actual fight that makes sense after all of the money he has produced over the years is beyond me
i know usman is mad tight after this interview 💀💀💀
Gotta respect Nate for taking this fight and for the legacy he will leave behind, win or lose. Him and Nick are the main reason I got into watching UFC back in 2011 and was inspired by both of them to start training MMA myself.
Hmm, Nate actually isnt sounding too good. Sounding a little punch drunk. he is slow and slurring some. Hope is OK.
This is a life changing interview!
This was a great I review bret! I'm out! Lol
I am a big Khamzat Fan but it is hard not to be fan of Nate Diaz. He is as real as it gets. A true warrior and original Gangster. His resume is wild. Really fought the best of the best out there.
Chimaev has the pressure on him. Nate is gunna go in there n smoothly submit khamzat.
I feel bad for Nate and what the bs UFC is doing to him
This is why I’ve been watching this dude for a decade!! Respect!  Diaz gang# Diaz against the world#
When Diaz said "You should've worked on a computer you nerd" I felt that was directed at me and we beefin now...
Think this might be the last real fighter on the UFC. Everyone else feel like puppets.
What a G. Which UFC fighter lays their homies on the negotiation table? If you don't back Diaz you are a worm
DIAZ 💯💪🏽🥋❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i'll bet on Nate 100%
to make nate open up like this, speaks well for brett. nate never spoke like this until now. nate is full of wisdom.
Win or loose in that fight Nate still wins regardless financially especially 🫡💯
Nate is baked and has CTE.
Nate. Stay Calm in this fight. You got this. Get mad when you start walking to the cage. Lets see that fire that you did to Cowboy and Connor please
Herpes on the lip, CTE on the brain, high as a kite and still 100% lame.
I hope Nate does his homework, everyone has cracks in their game, he can whoop this dude if he fights the right fight.
Nate wrecked
Respect to Nate. Without a doubt a legend in the game and future hall of famer but glad his time is up. If you are a fan and truly care for this mans well being you know he shouldn’t be fighting anymore. He’s starting to sound delusional.
Nick and Nate are Absolute Legends to the Sport of MMA, regardless of what people say or think; you cannot doubt the Toughness of the Diaz Brothers! True Stockton G Indeed!!
Real talk, I knew that was the case wit TUF 5. Hahahaha
Why is the video quality and sound in this absolute $h!t
Props to Brett for just letting stoned Nate ramble on the whole time. Gotta be one of the easiest interviews ever.
Let’s go naaaaate
I'm Down For The Diaz Broz when they start their own Fight Club!!!
Squab
Love the guy but he's very different in this video. Hope he's ok.
I cant wait until the translation comes out for this!
“Theyre all sitting down Indian style like they’re in school about to listen to the teacher” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Contracts for all the homies. Real G Shhhhtttt!!!!
Nate ending the interview kills me 😂😂
Nate is the man, win lose or draw I’m watching his fight 100%
He can barely complete a sentence but I got $500 on him so he better upset the books. Let's go Nate!
9:49  you're still being their champion.  that was deep nate
This was tough to watch.. lovvve Nate. But few too many head hits at this point
The camera guy focusing on Nate deserves a belt.
"Me and my brother are the best fighters ever in UFC!"  -Nate Diaz 2022
I’m not surprised MF
Great interview Brad
“This is just my half time show, I’m just getting started” bro I didn’t like Nate but he speaks the truth. Nate no doubt in my mind should be in the Hall of Fame WAY before Khabib.
NATE DIAZ A REAL LEGEND¡¡¡
10 minutes in and I have no idea what Nate is saying 😅
'Brad' hahaha
Nate is and will always be my favorite fighter
Good luck Nate, go get it.
I don't care if Nate wins or loses I'm a follow Nick and Nate anywere they go Canada 🇨🇦 for 209
Brett Okomoto  , would give anybody depression what a reckon low energy soul destroying vibe
nate diaz THE G.O.A.T.
Eddie Alvarez and Demetrius Johnson  former UFC champions was let go of the UFC right after a loss or two.   I think what Nate was trying to articulate is, despite having no belts and despite all his loses he is still a top prized  fighter in the UFC. Think about it, how many of Conor's former opponent is still in the roster or still high in PPV buys? A lot of prized fighters is dependent on belts and streaks.
Why is the quality so shitty?
15:19 Nate don’t even care what Khamzat name is 😂 love this dude!
He genuinely believes he's the best in the ufc lol.  Dude when was your last win? Admit it man
A la verga! I really hope Nate retires after this fight. When he talks, he is barely even making sense anymore. He’s definitely taken to many hits to head and should think about retirement.
This interview has wayyyy more views than khamzats interview lol we know why people are watching this fight and it ain’t cuz khamzats a massive ppv draw
the UFC want to bury the memory of the real GOATS because it creates nore hype and money for the present day supposed Goats.. u see abt every 7 years theres a new herd of Goats..  BHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA....
If he loses or wins let's riot ...who's down??? Killa Cali gang on standby wassup!!!
I’m not saying it Nate matter of fact I’m betting on you to summit him
Nate finna take this dub
Nate exposing Usman was 100% facts and hilarious
Nates the truth straight up  ..open ur eyes to what he's saying...rage against the machine...fucke the opps....Cali on deck !!!! Wassup!!!
Nate is the GOAT.
I'm not a 'hater' but let's be objective...arguably the Diaz Bros. are one of the GREATEST Marketing Efforts...done by mistake - ever! They don't have the best or even near the best records, but what they DO have is they have had a wide appeal that reaches the CORE of the UFC Demographic and they've had this from the start.  Both of them are a PR Agents worst nightmare but one their own they are Genius PR Train Wrecks that hit home runs.  They have an overblown, affable personality that helps them look through a lens that makes them believe and behave like they have twice as many wins and half their losses.  I'm not a die hard fan of Nate or Nick, I like their fighting style and i hope he submits Chimaev!
I threw him in a low risk parlay. Want him to win but wouldn’t bet my biscuits on it
#1 trending on YouTube
Lets goo nate!!
Respect to Nate as a fighter. That’s needless to say. Respect to Brett for the interview. He deserves credit too for performing such a great interview. Not everyone would be able to sit with Nate and give Nate the comfort of opening up the way he did in this interview. It doesn’t get more real than this.
@Natediaz you a goat BRO!!!
#1 on trending speaks a lot about how Nate is the real needle mover and there just using him to promote his opponent
Worst MMA channel censoring everything
He looks like Dana White.
"This fight isn't even about this guy, its about making this guy." I hope Nate gets to make that guy eat some crow
I am the champion of the whole UFC mic drop!!!!
Brilliant
Nate is 26-10 and hasn't won in years and claims he's the best in the UFC. Love his confidence and where his mind is! I hope he wins and beats the machine!
The definition of colorful ❤ Nate Diaz
Idk  why but I see pain in Nate eye's. This man deserves the win, I hope he wins this fight badly. I think he knows if he loses its the end of fighting for him. This fight is going to be brutal.
He's so handsome his character is it
real talk
Nate and Nick are very perceptive, they’re just not the best at articulating their thoughts. Still if you can parse through what he’s saying, it’s fascinating insight.
I'm so proud of him including his brother then two are the greatest nick loves his brother and he's raised his brother very well I'm proud of them born!!The organization everything yeahhhh greatest answer ever
Nate Diaz is the white mike Tyson
Nate undefeated undisputed
"All the great actors: Robert DeNiro...Al Pacino...  ...Adam Sandler..."
I gots to go! 🤣
Diaz brothers are the best always
He's look like a grand pa. To much weed IMO
this kid should do acting
Has he always sounded dumb and barely intelligible, or is it the result of too many blows to the head? They should interview a clam next. Might be more interesting.
SICK INTERVIEW With The GREAT NICK DIAZ
CTE plus mucho Marijuana?
I feel like nate overwhelms himself with stuff he's trying to get off his chest and say...get him going and he says it all lol he dgaf...rooting for Nate he deserves a win
LETS GO DIAZZZZ
Nate bout get work👎
The GOAT who lost 13 fights 😂😂😂
Great job to Brett for letting Nate talk and NOT interrupting.
I’m not surprised mofos
Nate is the GOAT.
Nate all day baby the real BMF
Close your eyes and it sounds like Mike Tyson speaking
Let's go nate,  we love you and will always love u♥️👊
9:49 Nate’s Kamaru Usman is spot on. Sounds a lot like him.
Brett okamoto is intensely boring to listen to
Shock the world brother, just like Leon did. You have a lot of people behind you, if you know it or not.
So glad he finally said he better get it done! That's what I'm talking about! Real is real. I love this dude! He's always been the champ for real! Respect!
Diaz Army AMFD!!!
gosh he's so delayed dumb. how incoherent his speech is, he not only does not hear the question, he even loses the meaning of his speech by jumping to something else altogether.. the feeling that he has the brain of a teenager who was left at school several times in the same class for several years
i dont like that nate is going in there sat feeling like its him vs the world. I hope he can use it in the fight
Nate is the Legendary Sorsseror Man SLAP!!!
Would love if Nate ended up winning and proved everyone wrong . Gonna miss watching this guy when he’s done fighting . Nate you are the goat !
Ufc did him dirty
Nate come ..on man you wins
All I got to say is IM NOT SURPRISED MFS💯💯💯
Great last words by the GOAT ,  I REFUSE TO BE LAME .
You will always be my favorite fighter 💪💪💪 real recognizes real
Brett always sitting in a way like he's on a date trying to serenade his date lmao
I still can't understand why people are looking at this fight like a giant mismatch.  If Chimaev takes him down, he'll have to remember Nates a Cesar Gracie black belt. If Chimaev decides to stand with him, he'll have to remember Nate nearly KO'd the current champ. I expect this to be WAR, and in WARS, Diaz usually wins
It’s definitely not easy to interview Nate Diaz , he’s had some people who have no bearing on how to handle a nate Diaz interview. But man this was one good and heartfelt by Nate’s standards that’s for sure. Nate’s a warrior in an age of gardeners
Feel like this sorta a therapy session for Nate, he had a lot in his mind and spoke about it. We behind you no matter what Diaz👊🏽
“You fought burns dawg, you fought burns” lmao Idky that geeks
Cali WEST COAST vs everybody!!!
Hope name doesn't take too much damage, dudes a legend.
Please give me a surprise！
seeing nate like this is sad..
This interview hit hard.. the pain in Nates eyes.. expressions can tell a thousand stories
Nate Diaz is the UFC. 🐐
We’re all gonna miss him when he’s gone!! Wish I “got him” early on…took a while for me to appreciate who he is and what he represents. WAR DIAZ!!
Always hoped that Khamzat win except this time.
Don't doubt yourself one bit!!! You could finish anyone on a good day bruh! Oleviera and Hate will clash at some point! I'm sorry but I wouldn't be shocked at all if Hate wins.
I feel stoned after watching this
What I wouldn't give to see Nate win this one.
"This makes no sense but u watching?" :D Nate's da maaaaaan!!!
Reall G bro
❤️ Nate Díaz 🔥 🥊
I love Nate but his attitude has held him back from getting the TItle shots!!! He’s been hit so many times he can’t remember the rest of the conversation. He better go for the submission because Khamzat will continue to move forward.
De Niro meets Tyson vibes
I dont feel like he is all in. Reminds me of Nick during robbie lawler prep...
GO GET EM  DIAZ 😩🍺✌👁
RD 5 SUBMISSION FOR STOCKTON
Nate, listen to me. You need to eat lean red meat! You will not have the muscles needed to win most fights now. Your body needs it. And remember: more animals are killed by vetable farming than beef farming! Remember that. When tilling a feild up to 500 animals are often killed.
CTE Is sad
I feel like Nate might do some crazy stuff. No telling about him...
Ah. It’s probably been mentioned. I’m not about to scroll through all these comments.  Stand up when you handshake. Time stamp: the end.  Amiright?
“You do steroids and I’ll smoke weed and we will get in there and fight” Diaz is the man!! He’s the top G
So underrated as a fighter but more so as a human! This is the the kind of  champ you'd want in your life, Nate is the meaning of the word true and loyal💯 💙
I loved the Diaz bros. since day one!! Let's go Nate Dog!!!
He needs to stop or he’s gonna end up like Ali.dude has CTE FOR SURE
NATE IS A LEGEND HE BETTER BE ON THE HALL OF FAME !!!! Dana white👋 Stockton smack
Nate get 1 Million views in a day! He is the main event!
This interview is iconic.
War Diaz!!!!!!!!!!!!
nate pls stay your one of the greatest of all time
Diaz by submission in the 4th.
I hope Nate shocks the world. He seems uncomfortable and unhappy and for someone that has worked so hard and has never lied to himself or anyone else he deserves to feel more accomplished. He’s a legend whether we want to admit it or not. We love you Nate and if this is the last time we see you in the octagon you will truly be missed by many.
If I were a UFC Fighter I would go on strike for Nate, pull the strike on PPV night  Cause if they can do this to this kind man, what you think they will do to you?
please let fighters interview fighters next time... this guy is an idiot
Let's Go Nate!!!  209 !!
Nate looks like his gonna cry
Nate Diaz loves conflict. And we love that
Nate is the Kanye West of the UFC. I love it. I’m a bit worried that he’s talking about if he gets stomped. You don’t usually hear fighters talk like that before a fight. It’s Nate Diaz though so who knows. I really hope he submits Kumshot.
We are finally seein nate tired... just a different tired.
Nate is burnt Lmaoo smh 🤦‍♂️ hope my boy shock the world tho 💪🏻
I love Nate he is a goat for real he been and still doing It I been watching him since he was with his hat backwards 🤣 arguing with the dude he didn't back down 😂 and seen all his fights never boring he is the truth if he gonna fight we know is going to be a War . I wish he wins just to see Dana's face 🤣🙏 💯 and because Nate is the UFC ! NATES ARMY LETS GO NATE NATION GOD BLESS YOU AND I PRAY GOD IS ON YOUR SIDE LIKE ALWAYS
a real warrior!!!!!!!
💯
USA badboy vs foreigner,  it's like Rocky vs Ivan Drago. I'm team 🇺🇸, it might be a long shot,  but I hope Nate wipes the floor with him.
Luv this guy! I detest White.
How much time Nate use F word ???
Idk all this guy does is cry and complain
Nate real Asf for tryna get his 10 boys contracts 💯 ✊🏼
“You should have worked on a computer somewhere you nerd” - Nate Diaz 2022
Nates ability to understand that the UFC needs some gate keepers to fight contenders when they are on their way up and down is impressive.
His heart is tied to the UFC it’s just the taking advantage of him that he’s not a fan of
The goats dont lose 15 times brother
head but   will does it
jajajaj. hes the main man! okomoto is a clown
Boy he pulls off ignorance pretty well..lol He’s definitely delusional but a legend for sure.
I would love to see Diaz choke Khamzat out.
Couldn’t understand a word from this crack head
Nate was always legit about not taking his teammates/brothers fights he’s always been as real as it gets.
Nate’s right that was a great interview
It's Soo easy to understand where hes coming from
The way he ended the interview is 🐐🐐🐐
Nate feels depressed fighting Khamzat lol
Look at what Leon did to usman... Diaz can’t be slept on But Zhamzat should dominate Should*
Feels like an interview of an inmate incarcerated for murder .....
Khamzat Chimaev guna get a slap fo sure
Love UFC but for sure they are greedy with money
I completely agree with Nate. The only reason the people that are at the TOP is because the UFC put them there. Nate and Nick should be at the top no questions
Nate is the Ron DeSantis of the UFC. I love them both.
he's got a bigg honker break it.  put it under his eye  .. he's done
"With the high moments you can expect the low moments coming and with the low moments you can expect the high moments coming."  Don't ever leave us Nate.
"you fought Burns, dawg...you fought Burns. whatever." classic gems at all times I hope Nate wins
"If you're Mr goat then make a goat." - Nate Diaz - 25:06
As a casual UFC I’ve noticed I a lot of fans love nate diaz but genuinely wondering why is that ? I looked up his record and it doesn’t seem like he’s an elite fighter definitely not top 5 in my opinion is it just he’s personality? Or am I missing something beyond his fight record
This.....is what happens with too many blows to the head.
Nate needs to get off to a fast start and not wait till the last 2 rounds to turn on the heat
He called that man Brad lol
Can someone translate what he's saying???
Win, loose or Draw, Nate will go down as one of the greatest and realist mother Fuckers too ever step in the Octogon and will go down in UFC histroy as such!  Let's Nate, shock the world one last time! Sending love from the 209!!
Love Nate but he’s brain dead and lost… Some of what he says makes sense but,, he’s about to get demolished no way was OR is the greatest fighter in the UFC 😔
💪💪
Been watching all the way.legend.Ok so for what shud be last fight really for nate spirits there all the best fights,  i bet that dogs got some steam left after all time in mma and his brother nick diaz legend  trainining  him to run the wolf down back to u know pretending to be little red riding hoods grandma lol.

Nate your the best win or lose ur the goat that’s right people Nate’s my goat and Whittaker! G.O.A.T greatest of all time it’s not G.F.O.A.T Greatest fighter of all time
Love what he said about Jon jones and roid abusers in the sport  They not even in the conversation. Legacy is tarnished and the real fighters know  Sheeeesh 🔥   Thank you Nate!
prayers you out master this kid
Nate's the G bro
NATE    break his nose you got him    he's gonna crash...  break his nose.
Great/true story,book Titled-"Cowboy Mafia 🪴🌿
Nate is sop over the place with his thoughts and i kinda love it
Wow man wow. Even tho Nate’s a fighter and fighters can’t say that there scared or know they lose. He knows the truth and speaks only truth. Devoted his whole life to this sport, for us… thank you nate best fighter in the whole roster for 15 years
Nate Diaz interviews are like watching a beast in the wild from those safari trucks!! DIAZ ARMY LFG and LETS GO BRANDON!!!
Thumbnail : ☹️
Wait… where did he hafta go?!  He didn’t even look at his watch
The reason why we love Nate Diaz.
That ending says a lot about this gladiator. He does this for US. He does this to entertain the people.
Hammered
nate is here asking the questions and answering them LMAO
interviewing Nate must be one of the craziest/confusing experiences a man can do by the looks of it
Nate looking like an Italian mob boss
Homie doesn’t need to get hit much more, either that or he smoked ALOT before the interview 😂. And who was bitching about Connor taking his money? I wonder why Nate! He could have taken everything and all the money with his popularity!!!
The fact Brett has gotten these kind of interviews out of Nate and Nick back to back is special man 👏👏
Nate seems a little punchy, hope he retires soon
Nate is a legend
Nate by submission💯💯
If you’re a Diaz fan , support him by getting you a fly shirt from his company. Represent tld is Diaz owned
He looks like Nick in the thumbnail
Nate the Master of disaster DIAZ, YOU WIN THIS ONE BABY!!
You got to love Nate Diaz!
Jon Jones, GSP,  Usman are all steroid cheats; out of the question as GOAT
The older Nate gets the more he looks like Nick.
Man i cannot wait for the next season of the ultimate contender.. Idk why this video made me think of that.. Such a shame nate didnt get an opportunity to win the ultimate contender after he mopped the floor with those guys he fought on the ultimate pretender..
Nate's Kamaru Usman impressions are HILARIOUS!
Why is brett okomoto head interviewer hes so dry
Diaz Army!!! LETS GO!!!
Nate is one of the toughest sumbitches....ever! No fear,  no apologies....just scrap...
In a Plastic World The Authentic are so hard to find l, We might be losing the last real UFC fighter My boys!!
Nate !! the man!
“I’m the champion of the whole UFC! “ that’s right
Is it just me or does Nate revamped for this fight. I get Khamzat is a dangerous fight, but he almost seems like he has a fire lit inside of him that we haven't seen in a while. Maybe its just his desire to crush the UFC's plans but either way this press conference is about to be wild
His pride doesn’t lie in the W. His pride lies in them hands. He gonna throw them with whoever. Gotta respect that.
They say G.S.P IS G.O.A.T. Nick was animal Nate is Manimal.
And they wouldn't have won The Ultimate Fighter he got beat before The Ultimate Fighter by the same guy that he thought in The Ultimate Fighter and that short guy can't think of his name his shoulder popped out when he had Nate Diaz down and his shoulder just popped out of joint so Nate Diaz one but he shouldn't have that guy's shoulder has been popping out for several years he should have had it fixed
Nate is the truth. I just wish he had a huge vocabulary. He'd be dropping knowledge every phrase. You cant have it all. 🤣 love nate
“You do steroids and I’ll smoke weed, then let’s squab!” That should be on a t-shirt
STATE OF WAR - Nathan Donald Diaz - Gangster Don
They selling wolf tickets💯💯
"I refuse to be lame" lol... love this guy
“ you should be working on a computer somewhere you nerd “ hahah!!! Love that guy!!
this proves drugs destroy brain cells.
When Nate gets going on telling his war stories he is so animated. That story of him almost beating up Dana...Nate was so enthusiastic 🤩
Love Nate. I pray he pull it off. But he sound punch drunk
I love Nates Kamaru Impersonation. Sounds exactly like him.
Nate sounds like he knows how the fights going to go.
Yo MMA world you know Connor is at the edge of his f****** seat right now
You must be a kid talking no matter Nate's got to Army behind him win lose or draw the truth is he's going to lose and he's going to lose bad he can't compete with this guy shouldn't even get in the ring with him would not surprise me if he comes up hurt before the fight if not this guy is going to hurt him severely this is not the guys that he normally fights and loses too on top of that
NAte has never lost a fight, he just runs out of time. (Except Josh Thompson)
It's true what he says... the UFC's pushes certain people to be their champio...Nate's a G
🥷🏻Real One🥷🏻
Nate’s the GOAT
“I refuse to be lame.”
Nate is the man hands down. Funny enough the two biggest G’s in the UFC both named Nate. Nate Diaz & Nate Landwehr
Nate seems like it lost it ngl
What does that mean he's got the entire Army behind him win lose or draw that makes no sense it does it doesn't matter if you've got an army behind you or you don't have an army behind you all that matters is whether you win or whether you lose and that's all that has ever mattered no matter what sport
I'm for nate ride or die
He definitely seems emotional responding to certain questions and mainly talking about his past.
CAN WE GET JOE TO DO ONE OF THESE INTERVIEWS????????
He deadass would rather fight Francis or Khamzat ☠️
If you the goat then make a goat 💯
War Diaz!
Diaz The Champ In My Book
So before the casual makes the big mistake of saying nates suffering from massive cte, just know hes always talked like this. Hes socially awkward. And 110% hes caused way more cte to his opponents than his opponents have to him. Ive never seen nate really be close to getting finished and fun fact: conor mcgregor, kamaru usman, Anderson silva, chuck liddell, gsp, izzy, fedor, jose aldo... Have all been knocked out cold... Some of them more than once.. Nate and nick diaz: have been finished but have never been koed in a fight. Maybe in some secret training that we dont know about, but its never happened in a real fight. Josh Thompson t.k.oed nate. Not koed. However if i hadnt known nate for a decade pre mcgregor like 95% of yall, id think a cop would automatically pull nate over, have him blow a breathalyzer, and id think hed blow a 2.00999% on a punch drunk level
Hope Nate wins, either way win lose or draw, I'm part of the Nate Army
Sorry respect to Nate, but he's not the greatest fighter to step into the octagon...
You can hear the CTE brain mush. Poor guy
Nate diaz talks for 25 min straight...stops... this was a great interview i gotta go lmao.... this dude is great man
This looked more like a shrink talking to his patient
Nate you gonna get carried out in a body bag !
This was a great interview hahahahahshsh
Homeys gonna get smoked
this guy is the worst interviewer, he never knows what to ask and often asks stupid follow up questions....and too many awkward moment.
nate needs to barrow a few brain cells.
🫡
Nesting his downfall this week!
Nate makes some great points, but stop saying you’re the best ever in the UFC. How are you the best fighter ever in the UFC if you’ve lost 13+ times?
This guy is one of a kind
STOCKTON!!! 209!!!! Let’s goooo
Nate vs McGregor 45
This is the most delusional I have ever seen Nate. And that's saying something. CTE is real. I hope Nate retires after this one.
Just right attitude simple but always on point Sharp love Diaz
Imagine how different the landscape is if he finishes Edwards in the 5th instead of jerking around.
Nate gonna fight till his 60
Nate proving he’s the realist in the game once again! Diaz is pulling that W!
The jealousy Nate has of guys that have beat him of guys that are champions is unreal that's why he keeps knocking them he had a chance he was in there 15 years if you can't be a champion in 15 years and you're never going to be a champion
Who is this guy
The interviewer man. Who are these people
Nobody lol
Nate IS a real gangster !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       209 baby !!!!!!!!!!
Why is the quality 720p max??? Were they using a hidden camera lmao
Nate is tooooo high lol
“I’m the champion of the whole UFC.” -Nate Diaz.
Omg I felt it when he said it’s about making khamzat and he looked genuinely upset and betrayed by the UFC given everything he’s done.
Kamaru sucks, most overrated fighter ever
(20:02)   “I told them to give me anyone they can get, Adesanya… Ngannou…” <~😂🤪😆 that’s why IFWYNate 👊 😎
You can tell by the way Nate is talking he knows he's going to lose this fight that's why he's talking about losing the fight if he loses the fight you don't talk about losing a fight unless you really believe you're going to lose it
Nate is forever the goat
Felt like there was an air of sadness from Nate Diaz. This might be our last pre fight interview from him. Crazy how time flies
This feels like a therapy session unlike most fight interviews
From TUF contender to one of the most known combat fighters of all time 💪🏼
Whats with the finger to the nose 4-5 times in a row is he on coke or something snortable
Diaz wins by RNC 2nd round
He forgot to talk about the greatest goat of all time GSP! Pure and Pure all the way!
greatest brain damage in the UFC still fighting LOL
!!!!Nick Diaz Army Motherfuckers!!!   🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻 💨🔥⛽️💨🔥⛽️💨🔥⛽️💨🔥⛽️
Nates impression of Kamaru was spot on🔥😂😂😂
Legit
"You know why my brother is the best fighter ever?"  *pauses, says nothing   "Besides all that"  Classic Diaz ❤️
Going to watch that episode it nvr gets old 🤣
They gotta stop disrespecting Nate. He may be getting a bit old but no one has the heart Nate does in the ring. I’m rooting for him to take chimaev to the deep end and show him his experience.
“They say I lost to Josh Thompson” ahahha love this guy
go get whooped by Kamara. oh wait, you can't because it was my idea, not yours LOL. nate is a nobody without his fanboys. cant wait for diaz to fight Ngannou
You might have won a lot more fights if you wasn't a pothead and that's the truth maybe when you was smoking pot you should have been training because nobody trains when they're smoking pot and both of y'all are a couple of potheads and that's what it amounts to that's what you want in life more than anything else is the smoke dope or you wouldn't choose it
you can tell nate is kind of hurt. when he was talkin about the ufc
Whats with this low level gangster this and gangster that talk?  The streets are run by the police and the octagon definitely ain't running by no gangsters. . Inside the octagon the best fighters are the ones with discipline and those who put hard work with strong hearts and minds.
21:50 🤣🤣🤣 "Bunch of Nerds!" 🤓
Definitely ufcs champion ☝️💯 Real talk
Nate’s been my favorite fighter, I’ve seen everyone his fights. Win lose or draw he’s still one of the best and polarizing the UFC has ever seen!
it aint right if its not happy- why is this motherfucker such a genius
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Legend 💯
All you assholes.  He is not right and he is being exploited.  There is no commission if this is allowed to proceed.
Dude just closed the interview 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 real savage
After watching this interview I finally realized what Nathan has meant by “I’m the champion, I’m the best”. Makes perfect sense to me now. Much respect
From the thumbnail, I thought Matt Damon had a cameo in this video.
“Ya shoulda worked on a computer somewhere ya nerd” 😂😂😂 gotta love Nate
Let's go Nate, I hope he shocks the world
The peoples champ!!!
God Brett does a horrible job of these interviews
I love Nate, but I don’t think he needs to fight anymore. Dude can barely finish a complete sentence, seems to be struggling for words. Sad part  is without fighting what else will he do?
38 minutes is way too long , felt like listening to a brain dead Joe Biden speech .Excruciating to watch .
The split second Usman impression was spot on ahahahahaha
High as fuk, lol
Met Nate in San Diego. Dude was so down to earth. Shook our hands, took pictures, we talked some BJJ… Told his guys to go ahead and sit down (we were in a restaurant) and really gave us the time of day. I’ve always been a fan, but that right there made me a diehard.
all i hope for is that this match doesnt end by Doctor Stoppage…
“Everything feels like the other day” true af.
This interviewer seems like a sociopath hahahahahaha even his steady gaze is uncomfortable lmfao
He just gave a perfect example of Kings and peasants kings are the ones who stand up for the little people and speak for the people without voices basically a peasant can be a regular person at any given moment but what he failed to realize is all people are great no matter when they say we're great best interview ever seen
The Diaz brothers are soldiers through and through! I’ve never wanted Nate to win a fight so bad. Let’s go BabY!!!
No lie chills the whole video
Why does he look emotional half the time and normal the other half
Respect, Nate really tried to get all his boys paid.
Nate n Dana gat love n respect for eachother
He said he wanted to be FREE and the UfC bleeped free out those bast*erds! 🇺🇸
its just an interview yet everybody want to tune in. dude is a real star and legend
I ain’t nobody’s champion I’m my own champion- nate Diaz 😂
I won't be surprised, motherfuc$er! Nate is going to smoke him!
Why’s Nate always seem like he’s about to cry ?
The 🐐 never fails to amaze me
Nate is the Residente of mma
Punch drunk
Another annoying passive aggressive nerd interviewer
I love how he is the exact same person thru this whole journey. Real fighter.
🇪🇸  Agarrense gen z los ancianos los quieten Matar Al por mayor
man from all of this i’ve grown to respect nate and actually like him 💪🏿
1 trending 😱 ppl love Nate ❤️
Absolute legend of the sport
He said you take steroids an I smoke w**d then lets get in there and fight 🤣😂
NDA MOTHERFUCKERS
Nate is the only guy that can talk for 33 minutes and not say anything
GOAT
LOOK AT THE SCARS ON HIS HEAD IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE THEY USE HIM TO FIGHT LIKE A PITBULL IN THE CAGE HOW IS THIS LEGAL BUT FIGHTING DOGS AINT I FEEL YOU NATE
Real deal BAMF just crazy how long he has been in the conversation with guys that are some of the greatest belt holders of all time.. and when he says he was always the Champ he’s not wrong,, definitely a peoples champ!! Long Live the peoples Champ
( 23:00 ) It takes a 100 goat$ 0r ten bulls to equal 1 RAM  Nate Diaz is that MAN !
Goat
Nate is funny and a true friend. I wish his my mate.
Really how Nate can win … would be a nice big F U to DANA
I feel bad this guy was given the short end of the stick in every way possible without saying anything ugly….
THE GOAT
This was a great interview Brat, I gotta go  The greatest to ever do it
Nate with the same  black t shirt since diaz vs mcgregor
This is a warrior! He will give it his all!
You definitely are a GOAT
War Diaz
Who else laughed when he’s said “it’s a little warm”😂
Espn 720p lol.
Nate winning by submission
You are the goat brother I love how you stand for your brother I am my brothers keeper
Nate Diaz is the man!!!! Respect!!! Go boxing and retire. Win or lose, he is forever the people's champion!!!
I’ve been saying it since they announced it, although Khamzat is rightfully a large favorite, I would not at all be surprised if Nate pulls it out. The matchup isn’t that lopsided when considering the Burns fight. He’s so hard to put away by strikes or grappling, endless gas tank, he can wobble people still, and he’s got slick BJJ. It shouldn’t be a write off. If he wins that would be unbelievably incredible, what a story!
Pppft he’s been fathering this little mother fkers for years
Always speaks his mind that's what makes the man so Sik Always keeps it 💯💯
29:00
Brett is not the right guy to interview Nate Diaz
Strong words by Nate I hope he can pull it off. The “fall guy” thing is just hard to hear  Give it all Nate!
I wouldn't pick a fight with nate, but he has been the "dog" of ufc for years meaning sick nate on him let's see how he does. Nates not the "best" fighter in my opinion but he is one of the hardest to put away and has the potential to win against anyone in the division. He is the best  in that aspect for sure.
How can you not want this guy to win, another "I'm not surprised mother fooker".... Moment would crazy. Diaz Army
Anything Can happen in a fight
The brother’s Diaz are everyone favourite fighters because they are true fighters they don’t fight just for the money they fight just because the fight
Diaz Army 🐐💯🔥
'I'll fight anyone' after spending the last year + turning down fights and callouts repeatedly.. Nate's the man, but i can't stand when he says stuff like that. I lose more respect for him as his career goes on. 'I'm the best in the UFC ever' You the man, Nate. Good luck this weekend!
#1 on trending. Amazing to see Nate get the love he deserves
he looks sick...
“Nate Diaz vs whatever the fk his name is” 😂 15:22
He’s talking about USMAN & IZZY being lame and not really fighting but doing just enough to not lose.
Too much mota !!!!
I won't EVER be able to put into words how much i love and admire this guy. KEEP IT REAL, NATE!
You can tell he's hurt by his treatment by the org for what he's done in the game.  He's a hall of famer already.
Nick diaz army
Never learned how to wrestle
Did he get knocked out recently by Jorge or am I tripping ?
He know he dead😂😭
I can only wish to hear Jon Annik scream “The original gangster tames the wolf!“  😂😅
12:38 FR SPEAKING THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
The swearing being censored really ruins the interview
Nate is a genius
He’s like a white mike Tyson lmao
Sad to to see shat he’s done to himself to entertain us. Real goat . Real fight fans know .
Proof it next week mf!!
Cte is real
Wow I had to comment on this imagine his  mind frame being stuck inside your head. Yo Nate win loose or draw buddy your still my favorite. Ik your tired of Dana white using bro I cant imagine this life of fighting all these tough mf for a name for them I got goosebumps after he said that
“I’m my own champion” -Nate  Nate all day !!
Hopefully my nicca Diaz comes out on top, but we gotta be realistic. khamzat gnna murk some shyt…Hes in his prime… “you do steroids I smoke some weed and let’s get in the ring ” Diaz 🐐👑 win or lose your solidified in this shyt 💯
“I refuse to be lame” - Nate Diaz    Goal accomplished
Legend 🥷🦾
Put Nate in the hall of fame , the only fighter who can lose but still win
Nate is the embodiment of "not giving a f*ck"
Respect from day one and will still be the same after this fight the best ever nate
33:24 favorite part
Lmao called him brad
It’s over when Nate says it’s over 💪🏽
An entire f'n army!
None of this made any sense, he contradicts himself almost as soon as he says anything and then doubles down. Classic Nate Diaz, classic CTE
“As far as I’m concerned I was a champion the whole time”  “I wanna go back w the homies and say you see how I did that”  Nobody has done it how Nate has 🐐
Khamzat is the one at the door listening to the interview waiting to see Nate
Let's go Nate
Nate you are the real deal brother! I hope you get paid  what you deserve!
I refuse to be lame!!!
He's not given nearly enough credit; Nate Diaz, is one of the most intelligent, insightful, business-wise, and REAL CHAMPION fighters, who has ever competed, in ALL of combat sports.  He "see's', EVERYTHING.  He accurately see's everyone, for who they are, and what they are doing.  He see's the individual fighters, he see's the fight business, he see's the UFC machine and the upper echelon players, and what those individuals are doing in order to make the most money, by pairing the correct fighters.  Nate see's, and is VERY aware, of every, single, detail and element, in the fight business.    I doubt there will ever be another fighter, like Nate.  I'll be pulling for him in the Chimaev fight; you bet I will.  And not because I want to see Chimaev be defeated.  No; it's because I want to see Nate, win.  God bless you Nate, and Godspeed.
Nate picked up where Nick left off.. some warriors
Nate’s gonna win  …..based on experience and 5 rounds.
Nates spoken true words. He can forgive the people blinded by UFC marketing but he doesn’t forgive fighters who know the fight game.   How are they going to pick khamzat to beat him? Nate would look like a TOTAL beast too if he fought unranked anybody. If he wanted to “pad his record” like everyone else he could win 50 fights in a row straight submitting everyone below top 10 and we’d be saying khamzat has no chance   Nates saying us, the fans, built khamzat up to be this BEAST and the pressure is on khamzat to live up to it not for Nate to prove us wrong. Instead he fights the toughest fights he can find   How good will khamzats record look if he fights top ten fighters for 10 years straight?   Nate said the same thing about Conor. These guys show up get marketed by the ufc and then they’re out the door and he’s still here fighting the top dogs   It’s going to be a nasty fight and you best believe Nate will be in this guys face saying “what you got? “
Nate made good points, ufc chews you up than spits you out. Nate did it his way, but he suffered some serious effects from his fights. But his point was fight for yourself and no just be a company guy or yes man because it all ends the same way.
NO SURPRISE!
GOAT
War Diaz
30:55 for all my Spanish speaking folk lol
He said “your welcome” he a real g
This seemed more like a therapy session than an interview
"I'm willing to fight niggas on steroids" 😳😲😂🤣😅🤣😂
There is something similar between nate Diaz and 6ixnine
Nate be rambling lowkey lmao 🤣
He is keeping it real. THAT is why I like the Diaz brothers
Is there an uncensored version
NATE WILL SUBMIT KHAZMAT CHIMAEV
Brett sucks at his job.
Nate is as real as it gets... He got me interested in the UFC and the UFC will never be the same without a Diaz brother in the promotion so Dana better get that check book out or he will regret it...
Views says it all 🤙🏻
Sounds terrible. Too much sacrifice for a sport
Nates a gangster but I'm betting he loses TKO to Khamzat
I love nate🙂
My man said Rickson 🤙
Nate REAL
Nate Wins by TKO.....👍
GREAT INTERVIEW.
Oh man  It sucks seeing this.. nate Diaz is turning into a gatekeeper..
6:00 but Nate, you’re not one of the greats like BJ or Fedor
NATE WILL DEFEAT KHAZMAT
nate and Eddie bravo need to have a pod! or is that just me?
i already placed my bet on nate +665 disrespectful Let’s go
What kind of a pro attacks a reporter. Not a fan,  Khamzat gonna crush.
Your the peoples champ!!!
This man is the GOAT
Nate diaz lays it down straight!
12:40🐐
The GOAT with a great reporter, finally a good mma reporter giving Nate a goof interview, very well done, timed his intersections perfectly
I don't like the fact that Bret didn't stand up when shaking his hand. You got the realest G of the sport, show some respect.
Did he say Rory Markam? 😂 (Rory Macdonald)
Brett Moto Moto
“You’re welcome” The most accurate thing he said 😎❤️🤙🏼👌🏼
Nate said ill fight niggas on steroids lmao
I remember first watching this dude when I was in prison almost 20 years ago. This dude is still fighting. Let that sink in
Love the way Nate ended that interview for Brad 🤣
The Diaz brother is the greatest nobody disagree with my opinion because that is my opinion
The most boring, stupid and manipulated fighter around. Guy must be chewing his knuckles having to interview this chump.
Nate needs to retire.  He’s been punched to many times, he’s punched out
No 1 on trending 🔥🔥
Say what ???? I’m having trouble understanding him .
Nate daiz burns the world!
He has so much scar tissue. Bleeder, bleeder alert!
I scored 4 touchdowns In one game!! I feel you! Haters gon hate!!!!! You are the greatest fighter who ever stepped in the octagon hands down! Longevity over popularity! Peace!!
Nate speaking facts, whoever he has fought has gotten a title shot right after
“I’m the champion of the whole ufc, all together, and I don’t give af!!” 😂💯
Brett sucks at interviewing, doesn’t even remember Nathan’s fights.  Any real fan could do a better job than okofake
Please just because you guys  going to interview with Nate let him smoke much is he can that’s not fare to me that’s not right that interview should be one of the the expensive restaurant  talking eating  booking home dining room for him open Louis the 13 wines  from 1890  Nate please bro dont go high and dry
Prediction : Diaz wins and does the most EPIC post fight interview of all time.
The realness
Nate's a dog.
Dana sees Nate as a gatekeeper. 😡
Nate’s had a great career. I hope he hangs it up after this because he’s already going to have a hard time as he gets older
It's the same as everything
Sorry I didn’t catch last part what Nate said…..”this was a great interview, I gotta Smoke???…..”
You're the GOAT and the Champ in the fight game in my opinion.
I don't think he is right.. I hope he can enjoy his retirement the best way he can, whatever the outcome of this fight is.
I hope Nate puts his lights out.
If people include his three ultimate fighter fights....this will be his 30th fight under the UFC banner....now that's some real sh**....💯
“You should be on a computer somewhere u nerd!” -Nate Diaz 🤣
I think Nate is a bit worried about this one.. he’s just to proud to ever admit it. This is a horrible match up. Shame on the ufc for even making this.
War
Does anybody else watch this and feel sorry for Nate?! Him and his brother both!
Nate’s coming out of this fight victorious
Nate seems really sad in this interview. its like he knows hes gonna lose and his career has come to an end. I would not be surprised if he retires after this fight.
Bro was willing to fight ngannou he just wanted to fight 😂😂 20:01
The realest in the game
people’s champ
#1 on Trending!
🐾🐾🐾💢💢💢
#1 trending. Ufc doing Nate dirty as always
"A bunch of nerds"😁😂
Bro I love him
So we can watch skulls getting smashed but we can't hear a curse word ?
Nate- a bunch of nerds Interviewer (laughs nervously hoping nate doesn’t recognize hes a nerd)
Nate wil win this fight
Nate is gonna submit this little boy this weekend.  Nate Army for life.!
“Fedor emalinko”😂😂😂 Nate’s jus naturally funny😎
really hope he wins he deserves it 100% 👏
ESPN buy some equipment
ESPN must have edited the mess out of this before uploading it. Go look at the video quality in Khamzat's interview and then compare it to the quality shown here. espn is lame for that. Win or lose, Nate Diaz will always be respected by the real ones.
THE REAL TOP G
This is not his prime. This is not a good fight to take.
Best fighter in the ufc ever at least he's comfortable saying it but yeeeea
I'm the champ of the whole UFC and I don't give a fu*k   love it , this is my half time show classic.
YES BABY I NEEDED THIS
Legend! ( mic drop)
Nate may not be the Champion. But he's the people's Champion.
When Nate talks about boring fighters, we all know.. Boring fighter cough cough Coughvington cough
💪
Why does it feel like Brett was being lowkey disrespectful to Nate the whole interview?  Then Nate calls him a chump at the end 😂
Nate needs to do fight ringside commentary with Joe and DC when he finally retires. I'd pay for that pay per view alone!
great interview, horrible video quality espn. filmed on iPhone 3?
I got a feeling this is his Retirement fight . True Beast at heart
ESPN ruins everything... Good luck Nate  Kazmat
Respect 🙏
Great job by both guys. Seems like Brett really enjoyed it too.
Was waiting for the "N word." 23:55
I'm with Nate on this one, hope to the Gods he wins because Chimaev is a force to be reckoned with!
Facts you are your own champion in mma. Record wise and performance.
Diaz bros 2 goats 🐐
I'm buying surely because of this 🐐 🌹🌹🌹🌹 Day 1 fan
Danm! I could say so much about this sit down. But it’s really worth listening to. Emotional, confusing, real conversation with Nate and nick diaz.
Remember when Dana White said he doesn't move the needle
This is the realest ...
win or lose, i know Nate will go out there and fight like a dog. he will stand 10ft tall aganist the bigger guy Khamzat.
Listen to what he’s saying how many champions have came in went during Nate’s time in the UFC….he’s got a point
#1 take away kids...  Don't do meth lol
Shysters will be shysters. Period!!!! Don’t matter if it’s Don king or next exploiter looking for their next Mandingo !  History will always repeat itself!
"You do steroids, I smoke weed & lets get in there and squabble". That is hilarious.
10mins into this gibberish and I have to turn it off..he was fun to watch but fk is talking about..dude's deluded
Win, lose, or draw.... Fans are with Nate Diaz. Diaz fought for UFC forever.
Cant wait for the post win interview
All Nate's fights should have been 5 rounds. No bleeding stopage on Nates part. . that would be or would have been beautiful
Wait, was there a second where Nate teared up during the interview?  I gained a lot of respect for him after this since I actually watched the whole interview and listened.
You can tell Nate had a lot to get off his chest
sux this is nates last fight dude was great and was great for the ufc. Nothing but respect and best wishes to a great future homie!!
If you watch at 1.25x his CTE calms down quite a bit
I refuse to be lame.  Nate is the realest
“Who’s the top 5?” “Usman, Volkanoski, Israel, Charles Oliveira” “I’ll fight them all in 5 seconds” 😂😂😂
@23:55 Nate Diaz uses the N word more then all combined black fighters in the UFC 🤦‍♂️.  When he did it, you can see him pause afterwards like "I just did that on ESPN...oh well"
“I’m the champion in the whole UFC, all-together and IDGAF*! “ 😎 Nate Diaz forever the goat 🔥 🐐
Let’s go Nate West Coast Stand Up
The"you fought burns." Had me laughing
“You should of worked on a computer somewhere you nerd”
you have to admit that he has a good point
Dawg turned it into a therapy session 😂😂
I kind of feel bad for Nate. He seems trapped living in a world that isn’t quite reality. He said he’s the best fighter in the UFC, and that he beat Leon Edwards. Neither of those are true. He lives in a certain worldview of him vs the world, but it isn’t even actually like that.
This mf is as real as it gets no bs with this cat
Win or lose he is the one that everybody cheer for so UFC knows They will never gone have another champ like Nate
If you don't respect Nate Diaz don't watch MMA
That's A Real One Son 💯💪
Leyenda eterna
I refuse to be lame. The Diaz bro's should have that on a shirt haha.
Take all this week in boys. Remember these moments. Last we see our boy Nate on a ufc fight week. Been a great run! 🇺🇸 mfers.  They doing Nate dirty. I hope he breaks khazmats something.
Espn is complicit for the poor payment of the fighters
Respect 🫡
Win or loose we will always love the Diaz brothers
There’s not a single bit of phony in Nate Diaz
Anyone else excited for Real Fight Inc?
He seems tired and not motivated
Nate is a legend period
i wont lie. Nate Is THE PEOPLES CHAMPION. I pray for ur success brother you are amazing.
It feels like he doesn't want to do it.
29:26 😂😂😂 bruh I can’t that’s hilarious
I love Nate but CTE is real
that is right  , REAL fight.  INC lets gooooo Nate army
I can’t wait
Not surprised motherfuckers
the end of the interview was hilarious. he was like "this was a great interview brett but i have to go" lol
Nate stuck in the past because the weed got him in stasis mode.
You nerd
His speech getting slower or it’s me?
He doesn't sound very confident
Bro stand up and shake the mans hand
War Diaz!!
So this is it for Nate right? He's done with the UFC. Anything think Nate could just lay down for khaznat and end it?
At some point somebodies gotta talk about CTE with this guy.  Still true legend, but let’s be real
23:35 😂 best reaction. Agreed Nate. Go get em Saturday.
No matter what happens this Saturday Nate Diaz will forever be loved and respected. His legacy will live on forever. 💯
9:50 that's actually a phenomenal Marty Usman impression. No cap
"I'm the champion of the whole ufc, all together,  I don't give a F***!". 🙌👊💪
Idk, kinda sorta think maybe... Just maybe (and I could be wrong) but I really don't think Nate gives a fk 😏
Brett did a good job de-escalating Nate's initial defensive posture. Great interview!
somebody get adam sandler to watch this STAT - mentioned amongst the all-time greats with de niro, pacino, and dicaprio yowzers
Amazing Quality 🤮
Wow Nate’s a G. I’m not resigning unless you sign all 10 of my guys. They don’t make ‘em like him anymore
Let’s go naaaate diiiiaaaaaaz!!!!
As soon as it starts he should tap the mat 3x . Flip the double birds and bounce out 👋209
Man I like Nate. Hasn't got a fake bone in his body and has always marched to the beat of his own drum. How can you not respect that?
Big fan of the Diaz bros, but this interview definitely seemed hard for Nate to do,
Nate Diaz is a G a top G he’s a badass ufc is lucky to have him
Mad respect to bro. He's a real one. Nothing but love.
Gonna miss this guy if its his last fight💪💯
I think Nate is seeing retirement and it makes him sad. When "what I do" becomes what will I do next it's always hard. Thank you both the Diaz brothers for years of entertainment.
Nick.  Can't wait to see U walk the Fckin UFC Kkk
Over 15 years in the UFC that's insane 🔥
That’s beautiful, “ill fight if all my friends get a contract”
@17:15 Brett ripped his pants
This was very difficult to watch.  Imagine being on the company side and trying to actually reason with Nate Diaz.  I am a fan as a fighter, but he’s one step removed from brain dead.  Incoherent, nonsensical, unable to finish thoughts or convert simple concepts (ones already in his head) to words.  It should be completely illegal to allow this man to take even one more punch to the dome. And now he faces Khamzat.  It’s absolutely ridiculous.
Diaaaaaz Gang!
REAL FIGHT INC.   NDA
Espn shame on you for the video and audio quality
I hope Nate wins and ends this hype train 🙏🏼
Kids this is why drugs are bad.
I feel like I’m watching a psychologist speak with his patient.
Nate keeping it real!!!! He is definitely amoung the goats!🔥🔥
Bro I have never seen Nate act like this. He knows he's going  to get destroyed. It's hilarious.
He slyly calls Brett a chump before he leaves lol
Eastside O'ville !
This guy is my hero. Period. I admire gameness. I admire REAL. I admire those who don't play a character, but actually are a character! A lot of life lessons can be learned from this man. I'm headed to Turlock CA, and I intend to go to Stockton. And shake this man's hand. Described in a single word:;GAME
Love Nate but take it easy on the self glorification
Nate is the real slim shady
diaz is the goat
Why does it look like Nate Diaz is on the verge of tears? Is he mentally OK? Even if Nate Diaz starts his own promotion "Journeymen Fights" he will always live under his big brother's shadow.
Hopefully Nate surprises us this Saturday, regardless if he wins or not he will always be an OG 🔥👊🏻
Jon jones ?? Whooo???? Lmfao
Nate is beyond g.o.a.t. status , he's the most straightforward , true to his word  , never back down and do not capitulate fighter the UFC ever had the privilege of promoting .
He show did speak his mind 💪🏽💪🏽 Nathan and Nick Diaz are My dogs
I want badly for Nate to win. I hope we don't see a "Rockhold/Cerrone/Gustafson-esque" exit from the UFC on Nate's part.
its like Ozzy if u squint your eyes and try to keep up
Just out here showing hella support for Nate!!!
Why is the quality so bad?
im with Nate!
love Nate
Just fight. Find the guy nobody is looking where you are.
brett gained a lot of respect as an interviewer with this one. or atleast he should.
Nate the GOAT!
I will never forget the way I felt when Nate choked out Connor McGregor in their first fight. I wanted him to win that fight so freaking bad. That's how I feel about this fight. Nate, you're up against a monster. Take him down, LEGEND!
If you weren’t watching this whole smoking your buggin😂
Trending #1 super star with out the push from the ufc
Amazing interview
#1 on trending! That’s The Diaz power!
yeah... we all thinking it. nate is delusional and practically brain dead. but ni-ganou though. rofl
I finally understand his point about champions being just random fighters that abide by a set of rules to be a champ.. he makes his own set of rules and considers himself the champ of those rulesets
Nate's a tough guy but let's be honest, he made his career off of one fight. He's had a journeyman's career. Also, he sounds scared of Chimaez. Never thought I'd see him scared, but I don't blame him. He has little chance to win and a large chance of getting really hurt.
I feel honored to share the same last name as this ufc legend 🐐 if he wins this I’m not surprised motherfuckers!!!
If nate took the time to define what he's trying to say some of u would understand the point he's trying to come across..
Audio is trash
Man I love Nate Diaz
CTE
Yeah i wont be surprised mfers
I watch Nate's interviews like it's church
I'm a chemaiev fan but diaz is a respectful veteran, wish him all good
Diaz is the goat
Crazy because if Nate wins, he could absolutely be considered for a title shot. Think about how much that changes things
Diaz no matter what...😎
A classic Nate Diaz interview!
I thought he was interviewing mike tyson for a moment.
Best line ever "IF YOURE MR GOAT...MAKE A GOAT" 🐐
He even looks 2 old
Mount Rushmore of the UFC: 4 of Nate's head
I reckon most people expect Nate to get wrecked. I doubt it. But even if he does, I will still love and respect him to the nth degree.
You got this Nate ...... Your the Cat man do!
Nate trending #1  fn legend
Nobody does interviews like helwani. Bretts lifeless. Rather see these done by a former legend, current badass,chael or  helwani
Although he talks a little slow, if u understand the UFC, the man is spitting straight facts. Dude is smarter than a lot of ppl think
NATHAN being NATHANNN. 209 Gangster, simple
This is hands down the best nate diaz interview. No BS just realtalk from nate.
Poor Nate. I hope people take care of him as he ages.
Nate is a hero
Nate should retire after this fight. One too many shots to the head. Assuming Chimaev doesn't turn him into a vegetable that is.
Only one word for this man: RESPECT!!
"As far as I'm concerned, I was a champion the whole time. "Realest muthafucka to ever fight in the UFC in the octagon and out, same for his brother!  The Diaz brothers should both get a place in the Hall of Fame titled and that literally states, they are the most respected fighters of all time when it comes to earning, having, and forever keeping the masses respect, whether you love, hate, or in awe of them.  Real talk, I fear that chamiave (or however you spell his name), will most likely beat my boy cause he is about that life he's proven, but I'm always backing the Diaz brothers because they have before the UFC and will always be about that life! Regardless, everybody knows that boy is at least going home with a Stockton smack that's a given...lol.
“…if I f’n ruin it, then haha that’s what you get for playin’ with me.” ~That kid Nate  😂🦾🦾
Nate is my favorite fighter, & Khamzat is my second favorite fighter. I hope Nate wins of course, but this fight is a lose lose for me. I want to see Nate go out on top, but I dont want Khamzat to get his first loss. Anyone else in my situation?
The volume is too low... :(
Im 5 mins in and this interviewer is tanking. This guy is like nates perfect opposite
Goat
Great interview love u diaz keep fighting u dawg 💪
Nate is a real one. 💪🏾
This dude definitely needs to stay away from interviews, for real 😧
sitting Indian style getting in trouble. 😆😆😆😆😂😂😂😂😂
ESPN of all things can't afford a camera better than an iPhone 4s
Come on Diaz!!! Show em one more time who's the man!
I'm most definitely a lover of this sport....Nate is the man and always has been, and always will be....he's been my favorite fighter since 2007....I just gotta say thank you for the 15 years of the best fights imaginable....I can't wait for Real Fight Inc....Props for sure...👍🤙💯💢

Just do your thing - let your fists fly - best of luck - it’s all good no matter what.
Nate trolling 🤣
You got it Nate 💯
Absolute gem
Bro sees his demise.. his whole demeanor knows what’s coming. His manager and anyone in the ufc involved in booking this are doing a legend dirty.
Great Interview? I agree. But it was only great because you finally expressed yourself bruh.
NATE DIAZ ARMY ALL DAY
Shitty move by the UFC
Lmao "you do steroids I'll smoke weed" and have better cardio
Best interview I’ve seen in a while. No one can ever deny the transparency 🙏🏻🤙🏻
Honestly man I hope (Nate) gets medical help after he’s done fighting for his neurological damage from fighting because,I believe he has CTE and he might have early Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s so I hope he gets the medical help he needs to fix the damage he caused from fighting!!
Diaz brothers are one  Icons of MMA world 🌎.  They should be in Hall of Fame
I'm sorry Nate Diaz says a bunch of bs man. It's laughable that the interview just agrees with it knowing it's just lies😂😂😂
Man Nate is The Best! Total Fact's! Real!!! Nate is Beastmode Respect!!!
Really appreciate how real Nate Diaz is. I wish more fighters had his mentality and approach to the game as far as being themselves.
20:00 what does he say??
Steven a is a batch come on ESPN. He doesn't know about fighting you killed the vibe of the video with his voice  Mark Zuckerberg vs Stephen a Smith  I got mark winning tko1st round
On a bad trip still.
Why isn’t this Ariel?
This has been my guy since that ultimate fighter season and will continue long after his last fight whenever that might be! Warriors heart!
man is he OK mentally?
This was cool.
nates a good guy. his realness is unlike anyone really
I love his impressions of Usman
Edwards Vs. Diaz 2 The best fight Now! I hope he wins.. Edwards with Diaz is Way More Exciting than that other guys rematch.
What did he say? “I’ll fight ____ on steroids” they bleeped it out. Hmmm
“These are you guys? And I’ll fight all of them in 5 seconds” lmaooo Nate is hilarious
Lmfao Adam Sandler with Robert dinero and dicaprio
This dude took so many shots to the head that he ain't even right in the head he's talking all weird
At least he knows and speaks his truth, he jumped around a bit, but most of what he said is 100% accurate! 👊
Let's not forget that Nate would kill anyone if it went over 3-5 rounds. The dude is an Enigma, insane how his pace picks up in rounds 3-5
i feel bad for this guy...
I refuse to be a lame-Nate smokedogg DiaZZZZZZ
Win or lose, Nate is always a winner to me
Nate should release his own weed...Stockton Slap
Nate high AF
Bret I gotta hand it to you , you got the best Nate interview I’ve ever seen.
He’s right 100%
Crazy but he's there with Mike Tyson's kind of reponses in interviews.Lots of similarities🤣🤣
sorry did i just hear nate say "i don't even know who kamaru fought"  really dude? he fought everyone....twice lol
Nate for sure smoked a FATTY before this interview 🤣💪🏼
That’s so true. Once some of this guys become champion either you go up or down.  They fight to protect what they have and not give you show. That’s why some of the fights are boring. Diaz Brother they real fighter, because they give you what came for.
Nate Diaz Army! NDA!!
But with all respect..  Nate is dog.. allways the Underdog 🤑💯
Nate Army!
Looking at both camps he will get destroyed
Nate Army!
Nate Army!
.
I don’t think I’ll get along with a guy like Nate Diaz, but too real not to respect 🫡
Good luck Nate, hope you win. Shock the world 🌎♥💙🌎
Nate beat champion mcgregor and never got the belt.    That’s Sad.  This guy fights and battles in every match up he is put against..
I’m not surprised mother fuckers!
Nate is so pissed off. Is the UFC a mafia organisation? Os it so money  based and screw fighters when they done with them?  Nate seems hurt badly and it seems that he expect to loose ...
I want Nate to win !!!! On God !!!
I Feel Like Nate has Nothing To Prove He Is The #👆🏼🫵🏼 Win or Lose 🫵🏼
Great Usman impersonation lol
The story of the backyard fight on tuf5 cracked me up. Everybody sitting there like they were in school and in trouble. I'm here getting me a soda send me home Lol
Got your back Diaz!
Diaz is absolutely the Champion of the UFC. Win or lose I love this man
This what brain damage sound like
Mike Tyson loves Nate the UFC Champion Diaz because they’re the same…they don’t give a duck
Camera guy could’ve saved himself a ton of work by just zooming out a little ffs lmao
this is why people love nate diaz
for God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son name Jesus that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life commit to Christ accept Jesus as your lord and savior before it's too late your choice no pressure all of God bless you all having a relationship with Christ is so amazing ur choice no pressure all love
Diaz army!
Diaz will go down as one of the greatest
First time im rooting for Nate Diaz
Nobody’s going to address the early stages of CTE that’s going on here..? Love Nate, but pretty obvious
He has been hit in the head too many times, this is over inside 1
Nate’s Usman impression was on point. 😂😂
!☆☆☆☆☆ASS THUMPER!!, DAIZ ARMY, ,east coast luv
This dude a legend of the game! All he's done in the sport and for how long? Legend! Real talk on Usman....I would love to see a great fight between Nate Diaz and Chimiev which I think it's going to be and then a rematch of Edward's vs Usman. The winner of those 2 fights should fight each other. Imagine Nate defeating Chimiev and then defeating Usman or Edward's. Nate - " Your welcome!! This is just my halftime show! This fight aint brought to you by the UFC ....it's brought to you by the real fight incorporated straight the F up!!! Better step it up for this one. Better get it done because the pressure is on you mofo. I don't give a F!! I don't need know respect this is forever. " Wow gangster!
NDA against the world.
12:47 he looked scared
Stockton Muthafuker! ...shut up & pay the man already. He looong over do...say what you will but Nick & Nate helped shape this sport.
When Brett asked why khamzat and Nate goes off on everything but his question reminds me of every time I took acid and tried to hold a conversation.  His confidence seems like he’s at peace with losing. With that said Nate by tko in the 5th.
Reminds me of Nick's interview where he was struggling to express himself also..but that's why they do it with their fists instead diaz army...!

“You do steroids, and I’ll smoke weed”
Nate is a G fr.
209 F everyone else they look down on us because we don’t give a f
Diaz with a 5th round tko!
I've always wondered if there could ever be a bigger ppv if Nick and Nate fought 🤔😏
His feelings are hurt and I can’t say I blame him.
Nah Nate, you wanted a top guy u got #3 have fun
Espn fix the volume you pieces of shits.
Why does Nate look so much like Thanos to me right now ….
After this fight I really hope Nate resigns a contract but all on his terms and get a bigger payout than what he's getting.
He’s already punch drunk. He can’t take many more big shots. He’ll pay later in life. He’s already slurred speech and brain dysfunction. He probably shouldn’t fight anymore to be honest.
Diaz army for life ✌️✌️✌️
GOAT
I ain't saying that, FOOK THEM (Khamzat/UFC) Champ!! Let's go Nate!!
Nate is going to chew this fella up.
He speaks nothing but the truth, Even the nightclub story about Dana "I almost beat Dana White up"😂😂😂 Everyone's a nerd😂 From Dublin yes Dublin Ireland really hope you smoke him on Saturday Nate👍 "This was a great interview Brad I gotta go"😂😂 funny mf🇮🇪🇮🇪
This feels like when I got in a school yard fight in elementary school and the principal sat me down in his office and asked me to explain myself.
Is it me or is the quality of this upload terrible?
Trending top 2 not khazmat
Does the quality of this video suck for anyone else?
The Audio is so low in this and Khamzats interview @ESPN MMA
HES THE BADDEST MOFHAFOKA IN THE UFC
Nate is delusional.  Royce Gracie got absolutely destroyed by Matt Hughes.  I respect Nate's grit, but he is going to get destroyed by Khamzat.
If Nate gets past the 1st round every round after will be in his favour. Nate could possibly finish in round 5.
If Diaz wins by submission it's 18/1
Best interview EVER 🙌 👌
“I REFUSE TO BE LAME!”
You can clearly see that he has biiig brain damage look how he talks
He has shocked the haters before hopefully he will again Diaz army forever
LETS GO KHAMZAT 🔥🐺
Very revealing interview
He batter wrestler now he cut it shorter
I can’t understand what Nate is saying
I’m a fan.. but Nate delusional a bit..,
If he derails this hype train he will be the pay per view king.
19:50 OMG Nate vs Tony would have been the match to make! NOT Tony vs Jang
Hope he wins. Little guy against the system.
This dude is delusional af
He’s got brain damage. Man terrible
Who HONESTY thinks he wins? Not Hopefully or faithfully but truly believes it??
Nate has so much brain damage. Top 3 favorite of all time though.
"As far as I'm concerned I was a champion the whole time" - Nate Diaz
Nate sounds like a sour puss for never being a champ, it’s ok. Your still Stockton! Still Nick Diaz army. To be fair, Nick really deserved everything you got! Connor took that from him!!! Not you! I hope you give him 90 percent of all earnings!!  If you was actually LOYAL!! To Nick Diaz Army! You already would have,,. You seem to forget it’s not the Nate Diaz army! Pay up!!!
Can’t believe there’s Diaz haters lmao
Bro what was this filmed on God dam
Bro if there were no time limits he'd be the reigning champion
2 mins in & I'm out. Nate can barely breath let alone speak he's so stoned.
Looking like nick Diaz 😂😂
Diaz in the fifth
Nate’s very right! New guys calling out the ogs was never a thing! Hoping Nate can ice him and leave Victorious
This dude is stone out of his mind, he’s all over the place in this interview.
Like Nate said his the champion of the hole UFC 🤙🏼
Let's go nate 👊👊
"I refuse to be lame"
This is the clearest I’ve ever heard Diaz talk for this amount of time he seems like he’s in a good place I wish him all the best let’s go get the win we all love you true fighter true worries I’m sparking a joint for you now my man 💪🙏
Love Nate, is he just super beat down from training?  OR just super baked?  or maybe both?
720 p ???????? What year is it ???
Win nate
As a hugeeeee nate diaz fan this the most concerned he ever sounded before a fight🤦‍♂️😔🤣
That felt like 5 minutes.
Still the same old G 💯
He sounds punch drunk to me… I don’t think he should be fighting…
Ariel the only one who knows how to interview Nate  This interview good tho
Why you speaking my name? I didn’t call for bj penn.   There’s a lot of wisdom in Nate’s thought process. The real bmf.
And someone was like booooo ….. and I thought …. I refuse to be lame! End of interview.
How has he never fought Colby.
" You should have worked on a computer somewhere you nerd!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good interview I like nate
12:37
I love nate and his logic is on point he is right about everything and is my GOAT for how he has grown over hos career. Ledgend
Oh come on Nate, your biggest wins have been Pettis and McGregor, stop it. SMH
Love you Nate.
I’m betting money on Nate this fight…. Mitch respect my boy …never been scared of a challenge
Live long Nate we love you
It is amazing that this guy sounds dumber each time he speaks
21:00 I don’t sleep like Usman that’s why you got dropped.. When Diaz fights.. it’s a FIGHT!!!  This ain’t no Adesanya bs shadow box, it’s a fight!!!
Dead Man Walking, 🧟‍♂️ hopefully The Wolf makes it quick
the goat interviewing himself again..great stuff nate!!!  start and ends on his time, great questions and answers.. hes even the goat at being a interviewer! ya cant deny, hes not surprised M.F.
Love Nate Diaz and the Army.   also a fan of khamzat.   Think I just like fights
I’ve always loved watching him and his brother fight I really hope he wins. But he is very hard to understand and get through an interview with
Sadly Nate is one of them guys after  he retired , will get full recognition and accolades as we know already
He's too high lol
looking forward to the no context extracts of this interview
Fr no doubt the most realist fighter ever
"if you're mister goat then make a goat" i love this guy!!!
Díaz vs Francis is funny just to get them both out the contract 😂😂
Nate said a LOT of true stuff in this interview, he well analysed how UFC works and the part unrelated to sport... even if it's always hard to get what he says and his short-term memory is messed up (probably he smokes too much). This interview made me wanna root for him instead of Khamzat but I'm pretty sure Khamzat will win
I’m prayin Drake bets on Khazmat
I refuse to be lame.  Yes that's the Diaz brothers all day. And this was the greatest interview. I hope nate sleep khazmat next weekend
209 stand up
One of a kind!
UFC robbed him of all his money and damaged his health. Mf has been fighting his whole life for less than 2% of the profits that he generated per fight for the UFC. 😤😡
Nate's badass, i don't just mean as a fighter but as a human being. What a real and down to earth cool MF'er. I hope he smokes this fool just like he did Connor when everyone doubted him and even if he doesn't he's still the goat. F that other dude.
18:35 ‼️💯💪✊🙏👊
Norte califas up in this thang. Saludos a toda la raza!
It sounds like Nate wants to prove something here in this fight. Not that he has to prove anything.
Brett was smart to mostly not talk and just let Nate go off.  This was gold.
Which brings us to our next topic. Don’t smoke crack
Nate has CTE and it’s scary.
Bret has learned how to interview the Diaz. Put a little out there and give them time to express them self with no pressure. Much respect.
Best ending ever!😂😂🐏
Let's goooooooooo!!!!!!!! NDA > ufc
Nate is the realist mofo that ever stepped on this planet, point, blank, period.
His fighting wash out nate
it's gonna go the distance. chimaev will come out on top. diaz's stock will double up...
Nate and Clay Guida! They are why I am here! Win lose or draw, you are getting your money’s worth!
GOAT
👏👏👏
Nate Diaz The One
Nate Diaz is hella overrated, only reason y he’s famous is because he beat Conor. Outside of that hes pretty mid
Seriously,  Nates speech has definitely improved majorly over these past years. Must be all the fighting.
Nate has such an fascinating, introspective take on things, in the most eccentric way. Dude is just a continuous stream of consciousness. Love that Bret just let him talk without interruption.
All of us must be honoured to see this Legend’s last fight 🫲👊🔥
Dude said Adam Sandler lmao
Great interview, Nate really is one of a kind and easily one of my favorite fighters in all of MMA. Win lose or draw he is still the same in my eyes. With that being said, I pray he pulls off the upset. He deserves it and It would be chaos!
''This fight is not about this guy. This fight is about making this guy.
I’m nobody’s champion, Also Nate “IM THE CHAMPION OF THE WHOLE UFC!!”
I hope he wins ! He deserves it !
DIAZ!!!
720P in 2022??
Watching this makes me even more hype for this fight
Nick and Nate are forever paramount in building the UFC. Never forget that Dana White who I respect 1000%. Actually, the USA 🇺🇸 needs more Nick, Nate and Dana Whites’ LETS GO NICK AND CHARLES OLIVIERA!!!
"I'll fight niggas on steroids..." is the greatest quote of all time 😂
His a different bred of fighter. Pound for pound is a load of marketing. Nate Diaz owns that list. 15 year career the legend lives on.
The more i hear Diaz in long form, the more i realize him and Tyson are connected on some kind of level
Nate even tell his interviewers when to stop 😎
You know what I'm saying......
Man I hope the organization took care of Nate, I hope he's set for life because he really deserves it!
Nate is, and always has been a warrior and contender...in any arena.
Hearing Nate take was great but the ppl that did this interview get a a negative 10 bc how you gonna have an interview with Nate Diaz and censor him. Terrible
Its hard to see him speak now. Too many hits.
I hope Nate wins
Nate’s a beast.
NDA 🦾
Nate Diaz!! Wind no DOUBT!!
NDA!
24:05 DEAL
Some people are naturally epic
I can already see the cut over his eyebrow getting opened again
Camera man earning his money today following Diaz head movement
I'm definitely a fan of Nate but he needs to lay off the smoke before a long sit-down interview 😅
Stoned off his head 24/7 can’t remember half things 😶‍🌫️
Respect Nate. But anyone remember that interview between Bobby Bueche and Lawrence Taylor.
Nate is so underrated, he deserves so much more respect from the ufc organisation and  I agree with pretty much everything he said
It’s funny cause almost nothing he said made sense lol
Love u Nate
This guy should of retired after winning against Connor McGregor, should of left on the top, instead of taking all of this unnecessary punishment.   I feel bad for him cause you can see the onset of cte.
West coast Gangster 🫡🫡🫡
Cumquat Jackeamav is a dead man!! 🥊
Lmao Bret questioning Nate like a Therapist instead of reading Nate's vibe a bit.
I love Nate and have my money on him this weekend. He also looks like cte personified.
NATE DIAZ ARMY LETS GOOOO. Tell me why you like Nate
Nate diaz gets the most views on this channel
why does this feel like Nate is sitting with his therapist? he seems like he's got so much on his mind... does anyone else see that or is it just me.
Win lose or draw.. Idgaf im always betting money on Nate 💯
Fair points.  Champions have come and gone.  He’s been relevant and competitive for a long long time.
Going to miss this MFer in the UFC haven’t missed a Diaz fight for as long as I’ve been a fan hoping he can pull this out and ride off into the sunset respect 🐐
How many blunts do you think he had before this interview? Either way….. respect to this dude!! I’ll put some $$ on him this fight!
"He fought burns dog.. burns"
what tf is the high mf even saying
If those guys are the goats then nate is a super goat
Win lose or draw, he always shows up and people who love this sport will always respect that.
New fans think they know everything but Nate and Khamzat is a closer fight than u think
Brett you need to do better at following up on the answers the fighters give you. I know that you're probably asking scripted questions but at least act like the person who you're interviewing is interacting with a person and not a robot. Fortunately, Nate is the kind of guy who will talk once you ask him something that gets him thinking or pisses him off.
Do you know why? Cause Nate don't give a 🖕
9:50😂
To me honestly nate should retire i am worried for him cause to me his speech sounds kinda slurred because of all the wars he was in not taking any thing away for nate but i think he should hang it up people might put fire on me for saying such.
Sometimes I think nate is crazy and lost his mind. But watching this interview he's right about alot of things.
I believe
Mighty Mouse Johnson is THE GOAT!  Period
why does brett okamoto have such a creepy vibe about him lmao
nate for the win! 💣💯
Great interview brother!! Nate is the best ever and he knows it...some people just don't recognize Nate ....
The goat 🐐
UFC have done Nate dirty. The guy put his whole life in this sport. Kept it real everytime and UFC throwing him to the wolves.  Just shows how these organisations can do you over at anytime regardless of what you have done to help build the company to where it is now. Nate a real one. Khamzat is a good fighter but he has a long way to go get a status like the Nate brothers and fighters like Khabib
Nate Diaz is a real one, I felt that. Real recognize real
“You do steroids. I’ll smoke weed. Let’s get in there and squap”  -Diaz 22’
What an absolute legend! Nate deserves a massive pay cheque! I hope he pulls an upset!
Train wreck
Anyone else think he looks like the robert de niro shark outta shark tale here?
Close your eyes and you hear Khamzat
Dam this interview goin down in history low key
Nate Diaz is the Allen Iverson of UFC! Is much respect forever
USA 🇺🇸 Nick Diaz Army
ufc pulled out the high powered 360p cameras for the Nate interview…
Nate is the greatest
Nate and nick Diaz my favorite fighters to watch…. Backed down backed out of no fights vs whoever 👊
You just can’t help but love this man! Mad respect Nate! When you make that walk Saturday Night, ALL OF US here & millions around the globe are walking behind you..Thank you for all the memories. 🙏 😎 👊🏻
Nate earned every bit of his respect,he goes to war every fight.
Nate speaking facts on ufc..
Nate Diaz is a mix between a Mexican 🇲🇽 mafia guy and De Niro 🇮🇹 -)) legend, hopefully he ko's that fool come Saturday
Nate is Fate!
Nate don't really like Brett
There will never be another Diaz bros. Blessed to have lived through their careers. No one compares. WAR DIAZ.
He is starting to look like Patrik Antonious
Brett is the worst lol
He’s not wrong “I’ve got to make somebody for you ?”  Big fax  Nate a real one
Still prefer when  Ariel interviews Nate
much respect for Nate Diaz he a real G
This was a great interview Brett, I have to go.
I've been waiting like 15 years for Nate to cough up whatever's been at the back of his throat all this time.   "I'm not their ideal colour.....well, not colour, but ideal model" ... he's projecting such delusions about how everybody is against him, so much so that he thought he was black and being racially discriminated against 🤣. Both Diaz brothers always have baby temper tantrum energy but they're usually so fun to watch that it's well worth it. I just wish for their sake, and their happiness, that they didn't have to think everything is a screwjob against them. Nate is the highest paid fighter on the UFC roster at the moment, secondly only to Connor.       Nate's logic: if Khamzat beats him, he's the #2 fighter in the world, because he just fought the guy that went on to win the title... 🤣makes NO sense, but a Diaz wouldn't be a Diaz if they didn't have some crazy way to deflect losing a fight.
Bro Nate is a goat talkin like that no one will ever talk as reckless as him.
God willing Nate wins
Talking to Bret is like speaking to a Xanax
This interview was good. Nate got the chance to spill out real sh*t from within. Win, lose, draw, there's only one Nate Diaz!  Otumfour Kojo Agyemang
Nate Diaz aka Walter jr
Let’s go nate
"I refuse to be lame" -Nate Diaz
Absolutely fantastic interview!
i need subtitles
“I’m the champion of the whole UFC. All together” lmfao
Let me preface this by saying I hope Nate takes it. That would be epic poetic justice. But where he is right now, mentally and emotionally—captured in this interview—I don’t know. I don’t think he’s in a good headspace at all, and it worries me.
This is why these guys my favorite fighters nick and Nate legends.
20:00 🤣  nate is great
Love this guy. I just wish I knew what he said in this interview 😶.
Slack jack high pitched lookin like he gonna cry. Let’s go Khamzat
It's 2022 and we're getting a 320p video throwback to 2006 :D
Why is the quality video so bad? Was it video'd on an iphona??
Dude has a lot of good points.
Is it just me or does Nate sound like Mike Tyson. I would never say that to either of them but makes you think the heart of a warrior has the voice of a... You fill in the blank I don't want that smoke.🤣
People are called legends way to easily.  However, Nate and Nick Diaz are true MMA legends.  Yet, I hope Nate has had an MRI recently and the results reviewed by the officials in Nevada.
People like Nate because he has heart… and he’s real, one of the few real ones on the UFC circuit
Nate is P4P greatest real fighter ever
that scar above your left eye will open up real quick come Saturday..
Nate would be the man on walking dead
Loved him on the Ultimate Fighter, still do.  The usual mainstream interviewer has little idea how to deal with Nate.  I do appreciate Bret letting Nate lay it down with few interruptions.
🐐
33:23😂
Represent.  Diaz Army
Come on espn 720p you guys cant do better
Who else was waiting for Nate to start crying?
What a legend . What a mind . You have to respect the kill or be killed mindset
Nate has clearly been hit way to many times. It's getting harder and harder to understand him. Most of the time he's not even making sense.
I like his point a true master is also a teacher nick is the master and he made nate and they both badass
He's got a 1 percent chance of winning and I'm hoping that it happens.
All talks about who are goats, well, here you go, GOAT just said these names. Mma evolve from these guys Diaz, Penn, Fedor, Gracie, GSP,  Silva, Hunt...plus PRIDE era fighters
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate ESPN let go of Ariel?
This was entertaining af lol I can't believe Brett didn't burst out laughing a couple times. Nate is speaking facts though UFC 100% wanna smash him before kicking him to the curb.
Chimaev better be ready. Nate has nothing to lose and everything to gain. It would be the ultimate 🖕to the UFC!!  WE ARE WITH YOU NATE!!!  DIAZ ARMY FOR LIFE!!!
Nate’s fight resume is unreal. Absolute legend of the sport.
Brett Okamoto is the Belal Muhammad of interviewers.
Likeable but delusional. California coast Victim mentality . He didn’t beat last opponents. Don’t undermine the athletes’ work. He fried his brain though; stay off drugs.
720p in 2022 has to be a crime. ESPN have some shame!
22:07 “Bunch of Nerds” 😂 -only Nate Diaz can call UFC fighters 😂 I’m dying haha
Nate's way of talking like a drunk person, seems like he smoked too much marijuana
So we’re not going to mention CTE?
The longer Nate talks the more he looks and sounds like Mike Tyson.
"it's what I do" Nate is a legend! Let's go
BETTING MY HOUSE, MY FIRST BORN AND MY WIFE ON NATE BY SUB! NDA!
Nate the realest in the game 💯
Nothing cool about taking punishment like he does
sound quality is garbage
Is there a moment throughout the day where this man isn't completely blitzed? 😂 God I love Nate Diaz
CTE
I think Nates whole point he's trying to get in this interview is that if he carried himself like other fighters, the UFC would treat him differently. But of course we know he marches to his own beat and that's why we will always love him.
if i felt i was being used by the ufc, i would tap out in the first 30 seconds, brush off the dust and walk away from the ufc. he owes nothing.
Best Nate interview ever
Brett is a good interviewer…let Nate say what he wanted to say,  great piece man, I don’t think I ever heard Nate talk that long 209 let’s go
I feel for Nate man. He just looks so over the UFC. He’s 100percent accurate. They are using him to make khamzats career
Speed 1.25
Nate basically interviewed himself and ends with “this was a great interview Brad, I gotta go” ✊🏻Nate is the GOAT 💯
Gives me khwai vibes 😂
Nate’s understanding of the game the UFC plays is actually genius.  Let’s go Nate !!!
I love diaz but I think hes been hit in the head too much.... he actually thinks he beat Leon Edwards
Nothing like a good diaz rant, respect 😤
would be hilarious if he just walks and just taps out lmao
Nick diaz army Australia
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Facts!!!!! Best fighter to step in the octagon!! Put this man in the hall fame
Best of luck for your upcoming fight Nate! ❤ from united Kingdom 🇬🇧
If your the goat than make a goat
I think it would have made sense for Nate to fight Tony Ferguson for his last fight. Both are legends in the sport around the same age. Definitely a money fight in my opinion and a good fight for Ferguson's welterweight debut and Nate's last fight.
ufc always make a lot of money when nate fights,  they should recognize him as what he is, a true superstar, I know isn't gonna be easy but i really hope nate can win on saturday
9:50 hilarious Kamaru impression😂
@EFC sign Nate Diaz next!
He doesn't understand anything. Much respect to the interviewer pretending to understand what he was saying.
Why is this interview so serious lol
yeah hes brain dead with an IQ less than 50
We don’t deserve Nate Diaz
Nate Diaz is the type of guy he came to give interview with his time and give lacture about his life then he can leave whenever he wants......true legend big respect but feel bad also we know hamzat going to dominate him
Facts idk who kamaru fought?? Who has he defended against?
Let’s go Nate , Diaz army 4 life. The ppl are with you homie .
9:50 awesome 😂😂😂😂
Nate is trending #3 🐐👊🏾
His impression of doucheman was absolutely hilarious. Mocking that soft spoken voice lmao
lets go nate. fuckem up
12:38 Nate Diaz
Alright Nate!! I see you.
Class
Win or lose people will always tune in to watch him fight because your Guaranteed kill or be killed fight not some lame as fight trying to win by points. That’s what most of the ufc fighters lack also he does and says what’s on his mind and doesn’t care about what anyone else including the ufc
Im looking forward to seeing old man Nate Diaz
Real G' !
Brett is more like a therapist than an interviewer
What's going on with the video quality here get it together ESPN, c'mon now
Nate's face is slowly morphing into Nick's  face
You know Conor is pulling for Nate
His whole life is UFC. All he knows. Let this man live
Diaz brothers and his team are all bad mothea fer's. Both Diaz boys are my champ hands down....
U know Nate was dead serious when he said he costed through that Leon fight 😂 pay day is a pay day
From Russia with love 💪
Watch this with the subtitle/captions on. I mean this with all due respect, I love Nate but watching YouTube try to capture names and some other things is a good laugh. And do it a little high for our boy Nate 😎
Some incredible insights and psychological tidbits in this,kudos for not interrupting,this is how to interview Nate
im not saying it ill ride with nate untill the wheels fall off
Nate a real one!💪
They recorded this off an iPod 3
That’s why they never let usman fight khamzat
Sad it's been censored
Much love for the legendary fighter and mythical orator: Nate “whatthefuckyoulookinatmotherfuckerillbustyourshitrightnowbitch” Diaz!
Diaz doest deserve this…
i hope this will not be doctor stoppage due to cut open scar tissue
Pay this man ufc!
I have Homeboys at home who are tougher then all these champions. Facts!! Legendary
Worried about Nate the next ten yrs are gonna be hard
NATE AND NICK ARE THE GOATS! 💯💯💯💯
the part he skips is the UFC made him RICH--don't forget that part----with the other items
I believe he is asking for help!!!!!!! 😔
Gonna be sad watching this fight knowing its nates last. What a legend
209
15:10 “Real Fight Incorporated Straight the F&@$ Up!” Sounds like as awesome organization! I’d buy that PPV! Respect ✊
He said "I'm the whole UFC champion". Nate Diaz is priceless.
LEGEND.
This interview hits different knowing it's the last one🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is it me or the image quality on this doodoo
I’ve never click so fast
I'm the CHAMPION of the Whole UFC!!!
I hope nate diaz shock these M’fs!!!!
*YOU THINK DIAZ DONT KNOW HIS FIGHTS???*
I love Nate. This interview was somewhat depressing. Nate seemed teary at times.. Such a warrior  I wish he isn't beaten too badly
Nate’s Kamaru impression is spot on!
Wish Nate would go on president joe rogans podcast
This felt a bit like being a third party observer at a therapy session.
This interview is the best Nate has ever had. It may even best ufc pre-fight interview of all time
16:00 man I really felt this part man ppl really doubting him
@espn how is the video quality only 720p.. it's 2022.
I would ask him, do you think your cut above your eye gonna re open within the first 15 sec of the fight lol. I feel like that same cut always opens up quick haha
„negannou“ 😂
Nate is the goat. 💯
Man its difficult for me to understand haha
It’s so hard form him to formulate a thought clearly makes you think he’s going to have Parkinson’s disease
Conor really did permanently disfigure the right side of his face.
Hey Nate!  It's been real and it's been nice, but it hasn't been real nice.  You are a Warrior 💯
32:27 they forgot to censor an “N” word
Why he going for kamaru so hard
Nate's hairline looks great. Nate by TKO.
I like both fighters
I love Nate win our loss
Nathan Diaz ladies and gentleman.
31:11 13:55
Diaz army, if cumshot gets tired he will got wot  conner got🦁
Watch him go in there and sleep Khamzat lol
At least Diaz put things in perspective.
I got Nate in round 3 or 4.
Everyone chill ! He's not dying
Nate will win this fight! Mark my words!
I would LOVE this guy to go on Mike Tysons hotbox podcast. That would be LEGENDARY. Cmon Mike make it happen!
Truthfully I’m hearing him. In a real fight no one beats Nate cuz u acc can’t kill him u get tired then go sleep
People were actually comparing Usman to guys like GSP and Silva, Silva was on a 16 fight win streak and 10 or 11 of those wins were title defenses, that means over half his win streak was beating the number 1 contender, and made it look easy, he also did the majority of it on the feet which is more impressive imo, to go that long without getting tagged and finished compared to just blanketing someone, GSP is without a doubt the undisputed welterweight GOAT
The rating system in the UFC is an absolute joke. It changes with Dana's wishes.....not base on reason or fairness.
I absolutely love Nate Diaz
His brain is done. Poor guy, why would you do that to yourself?
Nick or nate vs. Andrew Tate for the Top G belt... l
Nate's greatest interview.
MMA is political now, real ones know this man was a champion cause his heart always showed up.
Dana White is a piece of garbage, he uses these guys so he can keep supporting his c- habit.
No matter what the Diaz bros (especially Nate in my eyes) are one of the biggest parts of the UFC from the jump. There's certain things that are just staples of the sport that comes to mind when you think of the UFC an one of those things for most people are the Diaz bros no doubt about it.
What’s up with the  720p quality?
"A bunch of nerds" and keeps nodding his head. Haha I love him
This is just my halftime show...
Cue the hateful Russian bots in…
This was an amazing interview. Once Nate started to open up, he just went off & seems like he couldn't stop expressing everything he felt for all these years. He is one of very first fighters who got me interested in this sport. Mad, mad respect  Hoping for a historical moment but I won't be surprised!!! absolutely
Poor Brett, did all that homework and research and only got to spit out 2 questions lol you know he had a whole sheet of unanswered questions
Horrible interview. Keep asking stupid questions.
Nate is the biggest piece to the whole ppv. Khamzat is getting his biggest payday by far and it’s a little strange for him to fight Burns ranked 3rd and then back to Diaz who is ranked lower. Other then an eff you to Diaz and hoping KC spanks him on his way out the door cuz ND been getting busy with the best guys and almost dropped the current champion who beat him in a decision when Usman got dropped cold
Kinda get a Mike Tyson vibe from Nate .
Dam this has a 60 minutes vibe like interview.
Stockton slap the sh*t of him man my money's on you bro from 207 ME
Crim Dela crim
nate gonna win
Censored Nate Diaz is a funny listen
Nate Diaz the TRUE O(G)
He said you do steroids I’ll smoke weed and we can get in there and squab 😂😂🤣💯 gotta love him Nate’s a sav.
" go have a computer job nerd"... 😆 🤣
u will win g . i wish u the best                                                    ur a live legend
full mike tyson mode
What the fffff is he talking about????
ESPN! it is blasphemy to do a Nate Diaz interview and edit out the swearing!! who's watching this who isn't allowed to hear swear words? sort yourselves out you daft cunts
Giving you the inside iggy, real talk!!
I'm sorry but Nate is not all there.
Great fighter, but he still struggles in interviews. In my opinion, he is not a talker he is just a great fighter.
Dude, get a brain scan. Your body language and paranoia are signs not be ignored.
Nate is the man
KEEPING IT REAL. Vintage Nate.
TAKE HIS HEAD NATE!!
The vibe I’m picking up on he’s seems very upset like on the verge of tears which I usually don’t think he seems like I feel bad wish he had better ideas he could of easily been champ if he didn’t feel so comfortable on his back bc of black belt
You got this N8t
Don’t say good punch or kick. Don’t do the signature slap. That Mexican bearded guy can’t go pass 2 rounds. Diaz Vegas Strong. That was free.
“I’m willing to fight niggas on steroids”
Na screw all that guys… this whole “ the ufc is messed up for this match up “ DONT FEEL BAD FOR NATE. He’s a real G. He ain’t no punk. He’s gonna go out there and crack him in the jaw. Guaranteed. Nate you a legend. Go out there and live it up homie!
Am I the only one who thinks Nate is an OG Genius?
All I can say is, THAT was the definitive Nate Diaz interview! It will not be out-done.   Masterful skills, and REAL info for the Ages!   Bravo! I'm a big Khamzat fan, but what Nate did to Connor (U.S.A. vs. Others) will make me always loyal to Nate, especially with this Cold-Hearted "Company Set-Up" they puked on him! Plus.....I grew up 45 minutes from Stockton, and know his turf!
🐐. Vacaville. N. Cali soldier's. Stockton. Nate had fought the absolute best. Never had a tune up fight once!! His Doc f***ing Holiday modern. Anytime anywhere. Okamoto is a kljock riding dweeb too. Fake Ariel. Win or lose we all love u Nate
Huge fan of yours , Good Luck and God Bless
Nate here reminds me of Mike Tyson. Uncanny resemblance in their talking style.
Much love to Nate Diaz. Cool Af. Laid back speaking facts about the game
His brother is not the best fighter, but Nate might be.
"If your a goat make a goat" Nate Diaz 2022
Nathan is the man
"send me home I miss people at home"...OMG real talk from the last god that graceced the UFC....😂
He looks just like nick here…best interview…he let it all out
Nate we love you...you are a living legend...but please jesus christ...smoke some common sense in you before an interview😂😂😂😂 its hard to watch 😂😂😂
Nate, take the loss and just tap during the first exchange. Ive been watching CTE videos and I would rather see you prevent more damage than win.
Love You Nate🙏❤️🙏
If this is the last fight for Nate in the ufc.. thank you for everything you've ever done bro.. probably one of the greatest inspirations in MMA history win lose or draw
1:58 did he just fart?😂
Bro seems like he is a mess tbh
Can we please get 1080p resolution? Is that too much to ask in 2022?
I love how Nate is always the one to end the interview lmao
fave fighter ever but fk he's so dumb.. lol I'm dying for him to extrapolate, give insight into what makes him tick,  etc he just has no vocabulary I guess.. he uses the same 4 answers to 99% of all questions for like 10 years in a row
if your a goat make a goat! Nate Diaz
win or loose nate diaz will always be the peoples champ!!!!  go get that dub diaz
Brett Okamoto somehow made it 33 min. This guy one of the best!! Let's go Nate!!!
Team Nate! All day everyday.  You got this .
The man hasn't a brain cell.  He makes no sense
Nate made a good case bro. He is the goat.
"You do steroids and ill smoke weed and we'll get in there squab"  This is why we all love Nate Diaz
Hey espn,  it may seem weird to you but we are adults and we want to watch this interview without the cursing being removed ffs
Nate: says nothing  Me: I need more of this content
That boy better go into the fight with a bit more enthusiasm than this.
Nate Diaz is my favourite fighter of all time. The UFC owes him and Nick more than they will ever admit. Reality is he's been at this for years fighting the best in the world. When he says " I refuse to be lame" he delivers. I'll tune in for every fight he has as I always have.
Fiercest dog ever. A true FIGHTER.
I feel bad for the mma fans that cant get behind the Diaz brothers , the real bummer is that in ten years when they look back they are gonna see how wrong they got it , The Diaz brothers have been the most honest fighters they will ever see wether right or wrong
Khamzat is in for a fight. Nate is a dog
Waiting for him to get out a coherent sentence since his last one....oh so you're a wrestler now?
I like Khamzat and all but God I hope Nate wins then he rematch Leon for the title and for all you people Jesse on fire Michael Bisping all you guys saying oh the UFC is thinking about this and that Nate rematch Leon that was all me from the start so you’re welcome!!Now cut me a check!!
this feels like a therapy session than an interview for nate
First time I heard Nate say a word in Spanish.
Modern day gladiators. All these fighters deserve so much more than they get
Amazing interviewer!!!
I week to live
Nate sounds punch drunk... Hope this is his last fight he is a warrior and he has provided enough  entertainment to last a lifetime ... Take care of yourself Nate!
Nate is a living Legend
Great interview Brett. It's sad seeing Nate feeling like this about the fight. I hope he doesn't get hurt and take too much punishment. Will need Herb Dean for this one.
He high as f
Nate  ending the interview was dope
Watching Nate making Conor tap made me yell and jump around next to my brother's and friends, it is the loudest I yelled to date watching the UFC. Honorable mention is When Nunes K'O'd Cyborg or when Matt Serra beat the brakes of GSP , these 2 were my  2nd loudest yells lol. But back to Nate , I do hope he is happy with whatever he decides to do.  Glad he opened up in this interview. Hope he doesn't get hurt, Khamzat Has power and I'm hoping Nate  submits him to survive and not try to box him.
my money will always be on the guy that’s ready to put it all out  , he’s ready to die but always ready ti kill ,,,  he’s gonna make me some real money in this fight , he will win and this is why , the other guy has only experienced positive re enforcement never experienced adversity, he will !!
Good to See Nate make a shout out to Fedor Emielinenko. Alot of people sleep on Fedor not knowing hes one of the all time GOATS.
So by Nate saying he wanted to fight Adesanya or Nganu, in his mind he doesn't think those 2 are quite the star he is and they don't bring the ticket sales in. Would love to see the numbers between his fights and their fights to see who brings in more tickets. If Nate brings in more ticket sales than current champions, then what he's saying makes sense and Nates spewing huge bombs at dana and the organization.
Nothing but respect to Nate Díaz for telling it how it is...! The only one that bring pay per views like crazy.
Wow, not a good sign:  he seems reluctant going into this fight. Ugh.
It’s probably been said already but it is criminal that Nate’s last fight isn’t Conor! Or someone with a bigger name. Blows my mind.
"I refuuuuuse to be lame" Nate Diaz
The Hardest Man in the UFC - PERIOD
Half million in less then a day
the volume on this sucks....
Stay Nate
Nate you got this, easy fight!
Best interviewer ever, he got Nate to open up, ( didn’t feel like it had to be about him like with so many interviewers ) and stayed out of the way !!!
"You shoulda gone and worked on a computer somewhere, nerd!"  👀
The ufc should induct Nate and nick into the hall of fame at the same time, one brought in the other so they should go out on their shields together
You got this nate! I'm on nates side i like kazmat but nate i am on team nate.
Pretty cool how Nate said it’s his whole team getting contracts or he ain’t signing. Now that’s gangsta 🥊 RESPECT
I hope you win Champ
I love Nate but something seems different about him in this interview…. He seems off. Idk it’s just his demeanor and body language. I think he’s gonna get KO’d in rd 1 and retire :/
Audio is so bad can't hear much on my phone
He's not done. He's just done with ufc
This guys had more fight in the ufc than GSP, Jones, khabib, Israel, whitaker, usman, o'malley, petr... Totally disrespectful by the ufc. I wish him luck this weekend 👍🍀🤞
@30:55 Nate finally saying something in Spanish haha saying Dana was drunk but in spanish
That was amazing! Nate100%
Nate is very likeable.
I don't know if there's ever been a fighter who's legendary status has less to do with their W's and L's.
Man they need to let the diehard fans start doing interviews, these people asking the most stupid, irrelevant/disrespectful questions to these great fighters...smh
Nate is hilarious!!!
the real goat
Like seeing Nate emotional gives him the edge in this fight
"I refuse to be lame." - Nate Diaz
Diaz fans are the worst, they get so excited when he smokes. They should be arrested
I couldn't agree with Nate more about Jones and Silva. Great fighters but can't be in the talks of being GOAT
I bet Nates fart at 1:58 smelt like dat Weed.  Not kidding
Love Nate!! Brett did a good job of keepin in rollin while also stayin out of the way too. Great interview is right. Thanks!
Crazy how he was making 50k or less before Conor.
Finally an interviewer that lets the guest speak without interrupting.
How you gonna have a Nate Diaz interview and censor out the cursing?
I got my tickets  potentially  Tony and Nate final  fights against  Beasts  🙏  🤣 win or Lose thank you for all the years of Entertainment
Come on Nate, bring this one home.
The level of high in this interview is yes
Please don't get knocked out, MR. DIAZ!
I got into the sport too late. First Nate fight I saw live was against Pettis. That was one of the most electric moments I ever saw. The walkout, the fight, the post fight interview- it was perfect.
720p really..?
Much love Nate 🙏🏼 Hope you win this one, but either way...  🥊YOU ARE THE CHAMPION 🏆
Nate looks like he's about to cry.
Still wish we would've gotten Ferguson vs Diaz
His heads mushed..I can't watch this
they have been using nate as a stepping stool for fighters its really annoying
“This fight is brought to you by real fights incorporated” Nate Diaz
This is the only interview I didn't fast forward through or just cut off big up to Nate real recognize real elyte_stryker_coachp
Dude "knocks" Leon and then says "not trying to knock Leon"
Nate sounds slow, CTE
Rambling mess
NDA All day War Diaz kill'em all eff the system 💯👊
13:40 bro u fckn suck !!!
I’m saying Nate by rear naked choke
I wish you all the best nate.
He seems mentally defeated. Like he knows he's going out on a loss. I don't know...the energy in that room is dark.
People can argue all day long about how technical his fighting is, how good his boxing is, how smart he is, etc. etc.  But nobody can argue that Nate isn't a God damned gladiator with as much heart and will and determination as any other fighter we've ever seen... and I hope he isn't putting too much pressure on himself for this fight because, regardless of the outcome, he's already cemented himself as an absolute LEGEND of the sport.
They use nate like a wrestler to put him over,sad.
Nate the great!
i feel kinda sad for him and i've been a khamzat supporter since day 1, but sorry man my heart has Diaz i hope he give the ufc a big finger  edit: not sad that he has to fight khamzat, but how the ufc and the people have been treating him
Nate doesn’t even have to win to win all he has to do is create moments in the fight like he did to Leon!!’
Dude… he’s right. He has always fought the top guys, especially in an age of welterweights and lightweights not fighting each other and getting title shots. Looking at you Leon Edwards and Makhachev. So at the end, when Nate wanted a fight against a top guy, it’s different this time? For what? For what it’s worth, whoever signs Diaz afterwards isn’t considering his losing streak. Nobody is. Same with McGregor. It’s doesn’t matter, he’s bigger than his record.
Man my heart bleeds for my boy nate !!! Look at how frustrated he is !!
Instant classic. Epic. Nate Diaz , unfiltered, real, RAW.   I loved it.
O my children this what's gonna happen when you consume too many drugs and marijuana 😂
(24:05) lmaooooo
The Legend
Man Nate is the 🐐
“You do steroids I’ll smoke me weed, let’s get in there and squab” 😂 😂
My brain hurt.
I didn't understand, what's going on him.
BOUT THAT LIFE
This fight is a double edged sword for Nate, this is probably going to be one of his biggest pay days against one the worste matchups for him being his last fight for the organization
Please stop fighting Nate, that cte sounds serious in your speech. Protect your brain
God Brett annoys me
this guy can barley form a sentence without stumbling on himself and touching his face seems gooked out
This was worth every second!!!!
Lmao Nate right he said if your sneak juicin your out the question dog💀💀
I love Nate and his brother but let me says this... I don't think he should be fighting and it feels gross that UFC is allowing someone who's taken as much damage as Nate to fight. ESPECIALLY against this dude. It's obvious he's damaged. I wouldn't be surprised if he's got some level of CTE. I hope this is his last and the people around him can convince him to enjoy his legacy and stop taking damage.
REAL MFER
Stockton stand up 209 always been a big fan of Nate
I’d love it if khamzat got a cramp and quit in the first minute and nait flips the bird to Dana.
This man is not just some fighter, he literally is a modern day warrior. He could be a roman gladiator.
Can we please get someone to interpret what Diaz is saying? i mean he's either blazing out too much or is punch drunk! How he considers himself the best ever is just laughable to me. He better have a blood doner on standby.  I'm not a Hazmat fan either really no one to root for in this one!
Connor wasn’t wrong when he said Nate can’t count to 5, he’s def got a learning disability.
People are trippin. Did you guys not see the gilbert fight. Kamzat gassed out after 1 round and doesn't move his head at all. He got dropped by Gilbert. And you guys think he just going to go in there and starch Nate? 😂
What a legend
nate made sure on his last contact to make sure his whole gang eat before he leaves.He’s easy my favorite champion in the UFC
Stoned , maybe punch damage ,  I respect him he carried American flag at one of his fights. Not like other people American citizens flying Mexican flag.  Hope diaz wins .  He s gonna need luck on his side.
The CTE is blatant here
Diaz such an OG.  Not a gangster an OG
I've never seen Nate this nervous, dude must be losing his mind at the thought of being butchered by Khamzat
Nate is the realist.. if only Dana White realised what kind of fighter/person they HAD. Much love and respect 🙌  an Irish guy that believed you won against Conor. You are a beast Nate Diaz.❤😎
My money on Nate for sure 💯
Ain’t no doubt about it… Nate Diaz has ran the gauntlet time and time again. Dude just loves to fight.
So many great quotes from Nate  "You'll do steroids and I'll smoke weed" And what about puttint Adam Sandler at the same level of Al Pacino and De Niro. GOAT
I AINT GONNA BE SUPPRISED MOTHER FUCKERS... LETS GO NATE!!! 👊✊️💯
0:32 <- "it's what I do, it's what's been happening, it don't feel right if it's not happening."
Started watching MMA because him and his brother,but he is delusional
I don’t find the humor all you find in this interview. Pay attention.
@12:55 👌🏽💯
It's very clear that he's suffering from some form of cognitive problem. He needs to stop.
I’m a Nate fan but some of his fans are the like Dallas cowboys in terms of fans, some understand the opponent some are delusional. I’ve been delusional sometimes too when my cowboys play 🤦‍♂️😂
🐐🐐
Nate is going to win ....
This is awful, incoherent. And of course beta male of the century, Bret Okomoto does nothing- no challenges, push back, questions.... he literally just sat there. This is a new low, absolutely the worst sports “interview” I’ve ever seen.
That was great!
stockton goat
Get it Done For Nick !
Ah..i forgt..also respect for your work Bret.. good interviewer
Let's go nate 💪
Seems like he’s more worried about his name than the fight. Is his head even in this fight or does he just want to stay relevant and need the money. He’s about to face a younger, taller and stronger opponent dropping in weight that is all about winning. I was going to bet 10$ on him for old time sakes but he just talked me out of it.
Jesus Christ Brett really knows how to ruin an interview.
I want a first round knockout, and for Nate to scream “SMASH EVERYBODY” 😂
Kill or be killed 👊
Yup!!🙏❤️💪👌
I get his anger but just because you fight for a long time doesn't mean your the goat. You have to have wins to be considered the goat. You have way too many losses to be considered anything. You are a great fighter but great isn't being the goat, the greatest is and u def. are not. Check yourself. Difference between confident and cocky.
Not a big fan of interviews but Im a simple man, I saw 30 mins and I saw nate diaz next to it, I clicked
Nate is oddly philosophical.
Nate vs tony would of been elite
if he beats chimaev it'll be maybe the best storyline in MMA ever
“You do steriods I’ll smoke weed”-Nate Diaz
I know you have to be delusional to be successful as a fighter, but saying Leon was the easiest fight he had and that he basically beat him is a joke.
This guy has been used and abused by UFC & Dana and ate all the sh...t, so now he's throwing up all. Too late bro, but good that now you woke up lil bit. Good luck.
the corny casuals nate fans are jerking of to this gangsta words nate is saying
CTE IS A MOFO MAN.
This is CTE for sure
I think people misunderstand Nate, especially those that call him “delusional” when he claims he’s the goat. When he says he’s the goat, he means in the sense that, he’s been doing this since guys like Usman were in high school, Izzy was break dancing and GSP, Penn were the man.   Basically, longevity, and influence is what he refers to when he states he’s the goat. Also the factor of not being put out cold whilst majority of fighters have been fighting less than him and yet have been KO’d numerous amount of times.   And the fact that he’s never begged for anything or had to be the UFC’s puppet. Plus how he changed the game with CBD, picking his own fights etc. it’s a bigger picture than people realise.
I'm sensing some resentment from Nate for having never held the title. Which is sad.. because he competed with, and at times beat the best. He just never reached the mountaintop.
I didnt realise Nate is real close to the title. They could easily give him Leon for the title.
"You take steroids I'll smoke weed and we'll get in there and squabble" - Real Fight Promotion gonna be sick
Tough week for Nate.
They gonna wanna sign em for some more cash after he beat his ahhh 🤙🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼 let’s go Boss
Nate and Nick not the same. Nick's last fight he didn't seem like he wanted to be there and I get that feeling with Nate !
But he lost to alot of top guys so how does he think he is the best. He has a warrior mentality and heart but hes not as good as what he thinks
Nate knows he cut his hair too short😂
Díaz army 🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾
Nateee is greattt.!
Nate seems a down to earth guy and has been there since day one. And a dark horse and has always been the underdog but super tough and lethal Ju Jitsu on the ground. I really hope he beats this guy and cements his legacy...would be fab to see
Who else looking forward to Nate’s last fight on the UFC?
Not a huge fan of Brett, but this is where he shines. He asks some stupid questions but Nate is so comfortable with him. Doesn't matter what happens. They don't make people like the Diaz brothers anymore.
I dont understand a word this mofo is saying too much brain damage and weed bro ur lucky thid is your last fight
His CTE is blatant and present, rough not being able to remember names and locations of fights he had
Weed + Thousands of head shots = This 🤣🤣🤦🤦
Nate has always had fights stacked against him on purpose by the ufc they didn't give him the push they gave others and nate has earned his keep more than any fighter in the ufc with the people he fought ..dude fought legends and top tier fighters his entire career
I honestly feel like Diaz vs Ferg should have been his farewell fight and by proxy likely Fergs. This fight is unfortunate.
this doesn't feel like an interview but more of a son talking to his very old granddad, pretty  cool
Nate Diaz had the best lines ever. There’s a new king of this motherfucker now, I’m not surprised motherfuckers, he ain’t no west gangster like me. His post fight interview will be him promoting real fighting inc. he will light the mic up win, loose or draw. I’m really hoping Nate wins could you imagine the buzz when he’s making all the money.
“You should of worked on the computer somewhere you nerd” 🤣😂
Nate diaz doesn't lose fights, he runs out of rounds.
Diaz army🪖
Nate is unintentionally poetic when he speaks
Khamzat lost to Burns
“I made this guy fight you stupid…”
You can see the realness one Nate and have to respect that from a true fighter not like these other fighters doing it all for show  Love the Diaz brothers and what they’ve brought to the UFC  Hope he’s victorious this Saturday
Someone please sound bite “crème de la crème” part.
You would think he is high as a kite unless you know what weight cutting does to your mind, let’s go Diaz!
Think he has accepted this is his last fight in ufc
“Like i plan on being for the next 15 years” bro ur 37😂😂😂  I dont think so
Badass🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬❤️❤️❤️
This guy is crazy..crazy real..since day one..til now..the best whis ever done it..nothing but best for him..health..money..good guyes arround him..and the most..Gods Bless
The ufc is dead wrong.
Nate easily has the longest best career of any ufc fighter, he fights only the best fighters in the UFC for a long time
We need more Nate interviews!!!!!
Such tortured souls both him and nick have .. praying for u big Nate . Nick Diaz Army .. WAR
"You do steroids, i'll smoke weed, & let's just get in there & scrap."
Haha Nate is right. Jon jones is no Goat. If you steroid and then whoop someone it doesn’t count on the first place. Where are all the jones meatriders now?🤣
Nate spittin FAX.
This interviewer has the depth of a high school reporter.
Am I the only one who wishes one of Nate’s sentences made sense? Love him but come on man
Diaz Army for mfkng life. 100% 👊💯💪🔥
12:40   To basically sum up the interview lol
Looked like he teared up a few times. Lots going on here. Lots
I ain’t never heard Nate use a Spanish slur till now 30:53
23:56 "cause im willing to fight n****s on steroids"   Nate is the best thing to happen in the MMA world
I love how he always just abruptly leaves his interviews. Everything is on his terms! Lol
Nate is like Eminem
I been saying it at this point in Nate's career against nothing but killers him not getting finished is the real w. He out to prove a point there no quit in his blood. Nothing but respect to nate
This is the voice of fear!!!! Beware of the upset!!!! Now is when you see gracie bbj
He's a heroic individual, no 'bout a-doubt it!
He spoke his heart out this interview. Although i root for khamzat there will never be another Nate Diaz
I was born and raised in german english is the 3rd language i learned i understood everything he said.
Nick Diaz/Nathan Diaz...
NATE A REAL MF IDC WHAT NOBODY SAY
Nate Diaz has to be the biggest crybaby in the UFC all he does is complain regardless of who they give him
A lot I could say but I'll just sum it up with. Diaz the goat.
respect to the camera work here. next level - really captured the heart of what was important
The Stockton Strangler by strangulation! Let's go!
Fire the filming squad!!!!! Got a headache watching the camera going back and forth and zooming on Diaz
If Nate wins I won't be surprised motherfuckers.
"You do steroids, i smoke weed, lets get in there and scwab" Nate Diaz
Nate Diaz is gonna win! lets go Diaz army
Nates got CTE
Take him out Nate. Be the spoiler once again!!! The guy is human, figure out a way
You fought burns dog 😂😂
Did Nate just pull a reverse racism card?
It’s criminal that Nate was commissioned to fight. I wish Nate the best and I hope he’s making a healthy living outside the cage. As a Nate fan I don’t want to see this fight. And this whole interview was very hard to watch. Best wishes Nate and thank you for all the fun fights you have gave us.
UFC acts like everything is about competition but at the same time uses business moves learned from WWE. I've always been a fight fan not a sport competition fan. Get rid of judges/ get rid of rounds/ styles make fights
At 32 minutes and beyond is hilarious 😂 “shoulda been working on a computer ya nerd”
Diaz will win.
That's a good Kamaru Usman lol forst 2 sentence on Point
Mf almost got 10 of his boys into the UFC on accident🤣🙌
My boy Nate Diaz is the G.O.A.T wrangler if you guys are all the G.O.A.TS
Steve-O voice, Steve Urkel chin, Steven Tyler hippie, Steven Seagal martial arts, Steve Austin type beast. Go Diaz!
Nate is one of a kind.
I never watch an interview for 30 min!! When a Legend speaks u listen! Much respect for the 209
nate looks more like nick the older he gets lmao
Nate starting to show sign of brain damage
NATE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE HALL OF FAME AMAZING CAREER BROUGHT SO MANY EYES TO THE SPORT AND LITERALLY CAPTIVATED SO MANY FANS THIS GUY DESERVE RESPECT
Nate makes you realize how little the ufc values fighters. They only care about ppv numbers and selling tickets.
He just SOLO SMOKED the whole game ! Tell  em that game son 🤌🏾 Real recognize REAL 👊🏽 period !
As much as I like khamzat I wouldn't mind a nate win .. how can u not like this guy?
I will admit Nate Diaz you are a legend mate and this is honestly your best interview but everytime I listen to this guy talk I feel my brain cells leaving my own brain. All over the place haha
Nate the real og will always respect you big brudda
Why everyone acting like this in the comments. This foo is delusional
This is why we love him
Mudder fudder hi as a kite
I love how Brett allows Nate to keep talking and doesn’t really interrupt his flow. He let him continue to ramble and truly shows how delusional the Diaz brothers are. Nate acts as if it’s some conspiracy that the current guys that are champions are champions. They are champions because they won their fights including their title fights. You have to go out there and perform. 13 loss Nate Diaz was accomplished by his own hands.
There's a lot of pain inside him. Probably why he feels so comfortable fighting. I hope you find peace brother ✌
Oh M/Nate (and I hope you win bruv..) But dude you're farked fella
F  Cumshot hoping Nate finds a way 🙏 cumshot is cringe to me sounds like Adam Sandler doing Little Nicky but angry 😠
' Niganu ' ...   🤣🤣🤣⚰️
Nate has been in the ufc to see it change, there are strong storylines /narratives pushed by ufc . Fighter favoritism. That forces ufc athletes now a days to put on a wwe facade. Respect to Nate for keeping it about respecting the mma legends that built this sport. Ufc has swayed from the authenticity of the fighter.
Love you boy💪💯 I'm gonna ride for you Nate if nobody else will
I like nate but he’s delusional
This guys smoked way too much weed..  Lol  I hope he pulls off a crazy upset.
Nick is right. Nick wins life. God bless.
I've been a fan of Nick and Nate since Nick fought in strike force on spike
I've put 1k on you mate Liverpool FC come on Nate Diaz
WAR DIAZ!!!
209 mothafuckas
"Im the Champion of the whole UFC all together and I dont give a f*ck"
I think Nate's taken too many head shots.
Its probally hard for him to reflect on the fact he became a legend. Came up not wanting to be a champ. Just respected. He is the best in my book with Nick. Right up there with the greatest
Nate wins every fight don’t care about the outcome don’t care how stupid I sound.
Has anyone ever noticed Nate sounds like the white version of Mike Tyson?
Am praying to God that Nate shuts everyone and Dana up. They have done him dirty for his last fight! Who actually wanted to see this though? We wanted Connor Nate 3. Both older, not in the best form but a LEGENDARY EQUAL fight! Dana just wants name to get beaten up.
A Nate interview NEVER disappoints 😂
Win lose or draw. I'm a fan man
I think Nate has a really bad feeling about this fight
"He faught burns.........." GOATED lol Nick Diaz army
“I gotta make somebody for you?!”         .....” well, alright, you're welcome. You're welcome, UFC.”    Gotta love Nate! You have all of us behind you! Siempre! Let’s go!
*LEGEND*
Really hoping nate pulls it off! I feel like he can do it matter a fact I know it!
We all appreciate Nate and Nick's honest stream of consciousness when they spit truths.... and yet.... what if Nate wins???!!!
About 50 headlines from Nate here, you’re welcome ESPN! 👊
The only reason I’ll be buying the pay-per-view this weekend is because of Nate. And he’s the people’s champ.
Let’s goooooo Nate !!!!!
I don’t like Brett but thank goodness he let Nate talk. Great Interview
mmhmm
Nate wins it by sub in the 3rd
Bret applied the Helwani potion with the Diaz brothers: 32 mn of Nate talking!
they already did this basically with connor and he beat him (obviously not the contract stuff) so what is chimaev a better prospect than connor?
Nate desrves a big fight and payday.
If I woop his a$$ there gunna say he wasn't the best in town 🎶 😏
"you're welcome. this is just my halftime show."
THE REALEST
This was more of a therapy session than an interview lmao
23:30 Liked Nate's comment on Jon Jones not being worthy of the GOAT title due to steroid usage. Said he's completely out of the question to be considered a GOAT.
I had a +5000000 bet placed that Al Pacino would be mentioned in this interview
24:59 Khabib is making Islam makachev and continuing his father legacy
I really like Khamzat but I hope Diaz finishes him this weekend then sails off into the sunset
Won't consider Jon Jones a GOAT because of steroids. Says Anderson Silva is GOAT. CTE is strong with this one.
“I got homies at home harder than any champion”
If your mr goat make a goat 👏 drops mic
Nate has been 5 rounds with the champ! He has a good shot at the win!
"Not a needle-mover..." The Diaz brothers took over as the internet grew and I love their respect for one another. I hope it's another shake-up-the-world moment like he did to Conor McGregor but this Chimaev is nowhere near the level of fame and hype that Conor was when Diaz stomped him...
Nate reminiscing has a powerful feel to it. Like an old soldier or Samurai talking about the things they did
I could have watched another hour of this.  Nate is such a real genuine person who has no filter and tht is the reason people respect and love him so much. Win, lose our draw he always wins!! 🦾🦾👊🏼✋🏼
This was so hard to listen to. He’s the least articulate fellow I think I’ve ever seen interviewed.
23:57 🤔
I really hope Nate don’t hurt his back from carrying this whole card on his back. 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Always pumped up for a Diaz fight. Win or lose, his fights are the best. Diaz wins in a decision. Pumped for this fight. Legend and a real gangster.
He may not be the best to a lot but there is absolutely no one else I’d rather have by side than a Nate Diaz in the end. That dudes rides for his people.
Never shake a man’s hand sitting down.
Nate is going nuts. Legit though.
if u coild like a video a million times this interview would be the one
my man really hates marty for no reason lmao
All hail the DIAZ bros
It’s going to be a war but Nate is going to win 😤
I know exactly what Nate means when he says it all "feels like the other day"...
nate"IM FOR REAL IN THE FIGHT GAME" end of quote!!!!!!!!!
Rock on NATE !!!!!!!!!! You ARE, the man !!!!!!!!!!
"If I ruin it, then HaHa, that's what you get for playing with me for so long"
Nate "I understood but I didn't understand and now I really understand" 😂
I love Nate's MMA math Usman #1 Leon beat Usman so Leon is #1 Nate almost beat Leon so...  Nate #1  And if Khamzat wins  Khamzat #1 Nate #2
you had "high" moments lmao 🚬
If ur the goat go make a goat- Nate Diaz
There’s something about nate diaz something that khamzat will never have
Nate To Kumaru "Your their champion". Line of the year. 🔥
@ 12:32 bruh i died LOL
Why Brett gotta be fake He said I'm rooting for ya When clearly in the khamzat interview he said everyone knows what's gonna happen
After Bret said "final fight on the contract" and then silence and Nates "ya" kinda hurt. Can see and hear him say fighting is his life and all he knows. Never been a fanboy of Nate but gotta respect the desire and drive the guy has
Best UFC interview EVER. Win or lose..Nate and Nick are the dudes simply because they did it their way.  Not the best stats Not the most wins But REALNESS counts and it is increasingly hard to find in the UFC.
Diaz army, let’s go NATE!👊🏽💪🏽
how does an iPhone 5 have a better cam then ESPN? 720p rofl.....legit will NEVER subscribe
Hard to understand
espn doing their job and censoring cursing of a man who is sending people to the hospital with his body.
720p? LOL
Nate, you the man. You can shut all these idiots up.
22:33 “these are the guys?”. Absolute legend
Diaz is top 5 GOAT. Legend. The only fighter who has 1 up on him is Usman with his elite level toe stomping game & loser game, ain't NOBODY losing like Usman, the best loser in the MMA game - period. Legendary loser, will go down in history as the greatest loser of all time.
12:47
Let’s go Nate I’m rooting for you! 💯
When he said Jon Jones an he was like “who?” Killed me 😂
My heart wants Nate to win .
DIAZ with TKO
This reminds me on the interview nick gave to Ariel after saying he wanted to baptaise Nate
Nigganu 😂😂
“This was a great interview Brett, I gotta go” 😂
Sounding like a Mike Tyson interview lol. Man I hope he wins
Wow they're pushing the f*** outta this fight
You do steroids I smoke weed let’s get in there and scwobble
This is why love and respect Nate Diaz he keeps it real 💯
Man I'm genuinely concerned about the outcome of this fight... Nate sounds and looks a bit junky like
“You should have worked on a computer somewhere you nerd”
Real talk
Respect to Nate Diaz for keeping it real!!! 26:26
Brett know this interview gold
Whoever produces this channel is terrible…Fix your sound, fix your resolution…
Nate is the GOAT. Not as “the UFC champ” but as the realest to ever do it!
Nate has a zero chance to win
Nate is so dope. He's right no pressure on him
Nate will lose to Cumshot
Love how he speaks directly to his fan through the camera
Roberd de Niro, Adam Sandler.... Fedor 😂😂😂
This interview gets rollin and gained momentum. Nate is a MAN. And an individual. Not willing to bow down or point out the very corrupt foundation that not only holds the UFC together but all of today's culture.
Better not stop that last round m fkrs boycott if they do, last was a fkn joke
I can't wait to see the look on Khamzats face when he cranks you and you just keep coming with forward pressure. He's not ready and doesn't respect you! Ain't no better way to go out humbling Dana's New prospect!!!
If a….if aaaaa……….ifff
Bro is hurt inside you can hear it and see it  nothing but love to this legend ❤️ 💜
Gangster
Amazing that someone who talks like they've got down syndrome accomplished so much
" IM NOT SURPRISED MFs!!" It's coming Saturday MFs!!!!
Wish Nate the truly best in his life and career. You are the man, the real peoples champ. Win or lose it's NDA forever. Thank you for all the inspiration champ. We all behind you.
One last ride homeboy. Wish u all the best. You and Nick are the reason i watch the ufc. Give it ur all against khamzat. Respect NDA!
He looks damaged after 20 years this sport 😕
feels like its gonna happen all of a sudden, Nate will finally wake up and find himself locked up in the cage with Chimaev. But no doubt Nate is tough and Khamzat eats gangsters for breakfast
It's hard to understand what Nate says, specially if you are non-native speaker haha. Sounds like he's drunk or high or maybe both xD
hahaha the end. this was a great interview bret i have to go
Delusional.
You do steroids, I’ll smoke weed and lets get in there and squab.                     Nate -
Nate's entire life has been in some type of warfare.  Is Nate against the world & his chance of shocking the world this weekend is 50/50.🥋💪🤍
Facts start to finsish 👏❤
WARDIAZ209
REAL G
The Champ
Only potheads can understand him
For the first time Nate seems worried to me. I think he believes this is a really dangerous fight for him.
Nate is the truth.. best wishes good luck
nate finishes cuckshot
He’s punch drunk af this fight is ridiculous 😐
Volume a little lower if it's possible
let's home the Muslim wins they always do❤️👊
epic😁
Nate should go into acting after he retires from the UFC. He could pull off playing bad guys with out even trying....
Nate has been fighting for almost 20 years now the respect will always be there for him no matter wat he does
This definitely is Nate Diaz vs the UFC (and the UFC's posterboy in Chimaev). I hope Nate goes deep into his bag and pulls out an iconic victory. He's typically a late-starter but with Chimaev, I really hope he starts fast, furious and with purpose. It'd be absolutely incredible if he won. But Nate does remind me of Nick when he talks about fighting right now when he says it all feels the same and feels like this non-stop war. It's been his career and his life and even though he'll still be involved in MMA afterward when he stops fighting in the UFC, it's time to call it quits and be done. He truly seems mentally done with it and it's time for peace and to just mentor, back his boys and be in their corner. Glad he's done and ready to move forward past the UFC, no matter what happens.
Nate at 30:55 going Hella Mexican. Does this guy know how to interview. He wasted the first four minutes with bullish
Best interview ever love you Nate we're about to upset the world
I wonder if Nate is happy
I am not, for one , saying Khamzat is the favorite,……..5 rounds……..? Nate is the favorite for me.  …….Khamzat better get ready.
This interview has set MMA back 10 years. This is why MMA gets no respect. One of its biggest stars never learned English and thinks he's a gangster. CTE is real
Just realized every time he says adesanya he means usman💀
I love Nate Diaz but I hope he stopped fighting after this one. He should be coaching to anything else please don’t fight anymore after this. I see Mohammed Ali and it breaks my heart.
Is it me or Nate doesn’t seem all the way there. Hope he ends up good after all this fighting
Discusted from the uk how nates been treated in his history with ufc, absolute dog and masvidal 🤣 thank the doc he stopped them last mins
Much respect Nate.
The more the interview went on the more he opened. That was amazing. Loved listening to him every second of it. I really hope he wins, it would turn the whole WW division around!
He has the same memory glitch as me. "Everything feels like the other day..." Exactly. I have never grown old after an overdose on heroin when I was 17. All my memories feel real like they just happened. Weeks can go by and I wouldn't notice. Just a funny thought. Nate is wise and knows a lot. His vocabulary is limited but not his ability to reason.
They wanted Nate vs chandler 💀 that would of been a war
He’s right on so many levels.
He looks a lot like nick there.
This dude is so delusional 🤣🤣🤣
Nate dead next week
Nate is as real as it gets….. A proper fighter
Respect
Diaz feels they fuckn him wit Khabibulin
We love you Nathan. The peoples champ!🔥
He is v v v scared. This fight needs to be stopped asap
Man he sounds defeated already, but you know hes gonna come to fight, lets go nate
Nate would be the perfect actor for Frank Castle AKA the Punisher
The ending: “Great interview I gotta go.” Diaz does everything on his time, sit back and watch
"if you're mister goat then where's your goat?"
Love Nate, but Khmazat is way op
Nate and Conor really do appreciate friendships to the max, Nate would rather end his UFC career if his friends dont get signed and Conor nearly went to jail to protect his friend,  Real ppl like that whether famous or whether you love them or hate them, they're the type you want by your side.
33:26  “This was a great interview Brett I have to go” Lmaooo I thought the interviewer usually ends the interview
War Diaz
1-2 down the middle. Sleeps Alkaida in the 3rd or 4th.
His usman impresion 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👌🏾 brother from another
“If you’re the goat make a goat it” Put it on a t shirt 😂
Did he get scar tissue issue fixed?
He has a point…
This dude has so much brain damage 🤣🤣
Sounds like Mike Tyson...best line though, " I refuse to be lame"  (cough cough calling out Adesanya and Usman)
Why are y’all muting curses on YouTube? Lmao
Journalist shouldn’t be sitting like you own the room ……. Same for all whities who makes money out of athletes sweats & blood ……. More money for whities who absolutely do nothing but talk talk with fake smiles showing their fake too white teeth …. Only who played the sport as a pro should be doing this 💩
Let’s go Nate!👊
No need for questions he told us everything 😂 but on a real note it was a great interview indeed, i like the fact that bret didn't interrupt or tried to force his questions to be answered
Considering English isn't Nate's first language this was a pretty good interview.
Nate so used to the streets he's watching his own back even in an interview.
Diaz all day
13:56 , dam spitting facts, I really hope Nate wins and just flips Dana off
Brilliant!
THE LAST REAL FIGHTER.
"I REFUSE to be lame...".....*Classic way to end the interview.  💪🏾💪🏾
bunch of nerds 😂
It's gonna be a blood bath in the octagon.
Nate is so dam right about UFC
Facts everything my dog says. He has fought the who's who and gives respect to the people who came up. This new breed of fighters are a bunch of tools of the machine. UFC hypes these fighters up to make more money that's it. It's all business.
His whole career he was for Stockton
Legend
camaro usman vs fedor eminko
1:20 what Nate is gonna say when he guillotines khamzat
“If I’m not at war then somebody else is, the war never stops” straight up! my dogs gonna Stockton slap some sense into kumquats head.
This is unwatchable! This guy is one fight way from being brain dead! Is he fighting for the CTE belt next???
Absolute dog. Love Khamzat, but if Nate can pull this one off I’ll be over the moon.
Nate never takes easy fights
Never say die attitude top man,,and his brother the real deals
Stockton stand up 🥶👊🏼
Legend
Respect.
Hardcore MMA fans understand what Nate’s talking about.
Good Luck with Real FC Nate and Nick! Destroy ESPN's Ultimate Fake Championships. Real fans/fighters want real fighting.
Brett is so monotoned- soooo boring to listen to
The greatest GOAT, Gangster Of All Time
Nate can’t lose  Edit: Bret gives the best interviews
Nate is the coolest ufc fighter ever always honest I hope he gets the win 👌👊👍
Thank you Nick for being the father of them all.
if your a goat make a goat-  bars
You fought Burns bro
Nate fighting Tony Ferguson now that he went to welterweight again would be kinda interesting to see.
I mean….. he ain’t wrong🤣
Not always liked nate but hats off absolute soldier 👏 can see him winning this
Diaz Vs Chandler would have been amazing
Ur welcome Dubai 🤣🤣💀💀💀💀
There will never be another Nate, bro is going to make my cry after his fight is over.
This guy is something else. All the best, champ 💪🏻🥇
why is nate kamaru impression so good lmao
Nates kamaru Usman impression 😂🫵🏽
The toughest and realest in the UFC 💯
Should have been With Helwani.
All I can say is we all love you Nate go beat some a** this weekend
He looks like brad Pitt in fight club.. crazy resemblance.
He's probably the most delusional fighter in the history of the sport, but he gets away with it.
awesome interview. win or lose gotta love nate. still have a signed TUF team pulver jersey from him.
Thats how an interview should be, let the interviewee speak for as long as they care to.
Jorge dominated him .
Kill the hype Nate. Just like you did with McGregor.
Nate look focused and calm, that’s deadly when it comes to the Diaz brothers, I’m sure he knows he has the biggest test ahead of him. Don’t count him out ! Fire match 🔥🔥
Nate is an American treasure. We don’t deserve him.
I’m not sayin you lose brother,I’m sayin you win then rematch Leon for the title!!
Diaz bros on top
Diaz vs ngannou 😂😂
This fight angers me. I will watch and hope Nate shows well but I will never watch again. Putting a young natural 185er against an aging natural 155er is mad disrespectful by Dana. Dana says there is always another guy but for me Nate is the last of the "Skilled Fighters" and their is no reason to watch anymore. It started out as bar room brawl and turned into a hyper drug induced sport. Somewhere in the middle was the sweetness and the 209 crew was the best of them all.
How can you be so real and so delusional at the same time.
I hope he finds his fulfillment in Christ.
Diaz has a real chance here he's insanely tough with a endless gas tank if he can survive the initial onslaught of chimaev if he loses no one will fault him but if he wins he can do whatever he wants
Nate vs Tony needs to happen somehow someway
It's very sad seeing nate like that. It seems like his brain continues to deteriorate year after year. I wonder if it's due to all those hits on the head or all the smoking that he does.
“If you’re a goat then make a goat” that was crazy
Legend Nate Diaz love this interview he opened like never B4 respect bro 🤟
The UFC has done this man dirty his whole career
The best interview !!!
Wish Ariel still did this.
Nate Diaz Army
Diaz army!
Love Nate.  But we need subtitles. Can’t understand what he’s saying.  Idk if he’s punch drunk or high but he rambled and makes no sense.
Nate is very deceitful and is hiding a ton of toxicity. Body language says it all.
Lol that Usman impression
An interview that actually went smoothly for 30 minutes with Nate Diaz is monumental
DIAZ ARMY
straight G
The Most Underrated Fighter Of All Time !. Diaz Gng All The Way!!!!!!
Bret is a really fantastic interviewer. He does a great job of teasing out responses by following Nate’s line of thought without getting derailed. Glad that the UFC has legit professionals like him and John Anik on their staff.
Nate Diaz will win vs Khamzat, it is inevitable.
Same vibes as the nick diaz interview. Two of the best ever to step into the octagon.
Nate upsets Hamzat. Gets his rematch for the title against Edwards. And becomes The NEW…
👑NDA👑
Nate, at no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this chat is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
Who should I put my $50 on ?
Put some respect on this man's name!
Let's go Nate!!
Nate Diaz is an anomaly.  Each punch he absorbs his popularity grows.  That's how high his fan base is.
Wow I refuse to be lame!! I as a long time fan of Nick and Nate refuse to bet or go against them that’s why my money is on this real fighter this weekend 💯
Authenticity at its finest. Honest and raw.
I need this interview uncensored. This is the fight game. Dudes get their shyyt fk'ed up in these fights but they can't cuss? Foh espn
Diaz gonna shock the world 1 last time on Saturday 💪
Nate is the GOAT! Love the kid.
Hoping nate wins
Nate talks like Mike Tyson
i agree sum what what Nate say’s.   Jones on PSD  yea dats messed up -  but PSD  dont give u the technical technique involved i  strategic fight  still-  Jone’s has pure talent-  your eye’s are truely hazey
No matter what the outcome will be! We love you nate❤️❤️THE REAL OG❤️❤️
Bro this mf got CTE to the fullest and we still hoping he keep fighting🤦🏽‍♂️
Legend!! Real Fight Inc 🎯
Sad to see him like this can’t blame him for being scared tbh  McGregor would have been the right fight for him this is just unfair beating for a legend like him
Nate has the IQ of a plant. Reminds me of my buddies in high school that smoked so much weed their brain had the horsepower of a five year old. That plus CTE is Nate.
Hé has to stop fighting. Thanks for everything solder Think about your health et your brain damage my friend. You did gréât things  Congrats
Why does Brett look like he's the main villain and he's going to tell the Hero the truth and how Hero has lost
Bottom line is Nate Diaz is REAL to the m.f bone. What you see is what you get. Aint no fake b.s. from the Diaz brothers. They are from the heart. Aint nobody else like them nor will there ever be anyone that can do what they have done for the sport. Thanks for the memories and for showing up and comers what tough really is.
Leon schooled you muppet
high as a kite
Bret Okimoto = Nap Time
He ain't surprised mother fuckers. His give a fucks are non present at all times. The dude nate is fighting better realize Nate is a different kind of animal
Nate, a lot of respect to you from Russia! Love his last quote “it was a great interview” great interview!
The real life Rocky Balboa.
somebody fire okomoto dragon
Let's hope nates been training hard for this fight.
Great interview, but why we watching 720p in 2022 😅
Narrative
Dreadful interviewer
I'm supporting Nate we're all with you win or lose .
That was incredible
I love this interview with nate, as its the most open he's been, but his cte is really showing here. I cant help it, it makes me sad to see.
Wow the blibed him sayin I just want to be free as if it was a cuss
LET'S GO DIAZ
Hands down favorite fighter of all time
Nate & Nick will forever be mma legends
Lmao Nate talking about "boring" fighters 'you should've worked on a computer, you nerd' 🤣
I'd rather listen to Joe Biden speak than Nate.
the story of my life, the white man trying to keep me down.
Nate Diaz the only man alive to end an interview after finishing a random story and just saying ”This was a great interview, I have to go” to an interviewer who didn’t say anything in a whole interview 😂😂😂
Behind Nate Diaz strong 💪🏽
Deffo number one fighter you made the ufc fun Stockton slap 209 motherfucker
Goat
Why does Brett make this feel like a therapy session?
Not gonna lie he looks cognitively terrible.
The legendary Nate Diaz.  At the top of the list. #1
NICK DIAZ ARMY MF
Dont do drugs kids
The only reason why I watch this sh*t is because of Nick & Nate.  I probably won’t be interested without them.
Nate sit down with someone. I think others would want this same. Sit down with someone and just rap. Give us some stories. Highs, lows. Ups, downs. Beginning, middle, possible future. I think many others would like to see it. Not necessarily auto biography.  Just do some back n forth. I see the stories in you brother.
That was totally incoherent. Too many brain cells killed from drugs and punches. He probably didn't have many to start with.
If there really is any MMA gods up there 👆 , Nate is gonna choke Khamzat out like he did McGregor on Saturday and leave with the greatest finish in the game!
is there an uncensored version? not all of us are 5
Love you Nate. We believe in you.
Not gonna lie, I’m always team Pettis. But putting my 220 monthly pain medication on Nate Diaz this weekend. I’m fully committed to being on DIAZ side.
need a translator asap 🙏🏿
I think the UFC are hoping Nate goes out on a loss, to lower his stock.
Nate wins as soon as he slaps khamzat. That's all he's got to do for his followers
Was a great interview
I love how he expose Usman being a fake friend with Israel, just for the money.
As dumb as he sounds, he's actually got a lot of it right lol.
That CTE Nate has is bad. He can barely talk right
Very interesting Interview Nate came in very nonchalant and was sticking to the roots of who he is on the surface. Glad the interviewer wasn’t discouraged from asking questions to get him to open up. I think this may be Nate last legit huge fight considering he’s getting older if he doesn’t win this I think he does some soul searching and may not comeback. Super emotional interview Nate is reflecting a lot on his career as if this may be one of the last pivotal moments in it.
"I refuse to be lame"                  -Nate Diaz
Dum fuker finna be played by khamzat
Love watching these brothers!
CTE? 🥴 Or is he just high asf?
brain dead... image what he will be like at 50
Nate is a legend he changed the game
Thanks YT for 20sec ad in the middle of video... That's what i needed.
I feel nervous just watching this
These casuals don’t even know Rickson, or Royce. They’ve seen UFC 200something but they’ve never even seen UFC 1-5
Nate  is a 💯 legend no matter what happens he can do whatever he wants and we will still watch
Nate has put in more work than any other UFC fighter. Pay Nate and let him go live his legacy.
Nicks little bro always has my respect 🤜
Dudes borderline autistic at this point.
Recorded on Nokia 3310 , the legend
The impressions of Usman and Burns are on point 😂
@ufc if Diaz slaps this dude yous owe him the leg humper comes out off retirement to fight him.
He’s a dead man lol
Respect to Nate🇮🇪
“I’ll fight a mf on steroids” -Nate Diaz
I agree with everything nate said. They are prize fighters and nate has fought the best for the longest
Nate: Who is top 5 p4p right now? Interviewer: Lists top 5 p4p Nate: Yeah, I'll fight all them in 5 seconds
Every nate diaz interview is a classic. Keepin it real
17:17 Okamoto scared to death
Nate can really put the words together. And I thought Tito Ortiz was a wordsmith!
I want to see Nate vs Colby!
Closed Captions on boys!
True warrior
Has he cleared his medicals? He tossed Adam Sandler in there with DeNjro and Pacino…
someone save him!!!!
Props to Fedor Milenko
Diaz Usman impersonation is in point
I listened to the first 10 minutes and I still don't know why so many people are commenting about how awesome the interview is. Maybe the good stuff is in the latter 2/3
The real ww champ lol
protect nate at all cost
Esse tem o direito de entrar para o hall da fama dos lutadores só lutou com os pedreiras um guerreiro q não chora.
“Don’t matter if you win or lose, as long as you squabble - thats gangsta” - Bone from End of Watch
"It feels like it has many of times" - Nate Diaz
I don’t think he has a chance I know he has a chance. If there’s one person you can. Not. Count. Out. It’s Nate Diaz.
Cognitive Dissonance: the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change.
how can you dislike an OG like Nate Diaz - one of the best to not win a UFC title.  Crazy there are household name fighters like him, Cowboy, Chael that never officially won a title but have legacies that will far outlive them.
He is just being real, I get his point
WEST COAST STAND UP. This man needs us more than ever yeah we can’t go in there with him, but we can send positive pot head vibes smash this fool Nate.
Love Nate just don't end up like Muhammad Ali homie we know you the best!!!!!!!! Much love Nate forever!!!
He is better human being than Habib wanting best contracts and money for his friends
Imagine if Nate wins tho…
The "goat"...👍🏾💯💯 Great interview
Terrible audio quality, cmon ESPN.
Nate has his own way of talking, but he’s no dummy. He knows exactly what’s going on.
Nate sounds like his heart isn’t in it anymore. I’m Glad this is his last fight. He can focus on his family and teaching.
Stay real 💯✨
Call him doctor real. Mr real
Atleast Nate knows why he's there.. the fact Dana let's him continue to fight is kind of amazing. I hope he gets paid and gets out! Nate a savage regardless
The most Frustrating interview. Can’t stand the way he communicates
He said nnnigganu 💀
My word this dude is delusional haha
A real G. he Reminds me of all the friends I grew up with in Concord CA.
I believe Nate signed a contract for 1.2 million dollars to enter the cage and start the first round. Khamzat win or lose at $600,000.
May favor, provision, and good fortune always be with the Diaz brothers!!! 🙏 Hope them the best post UFC!!!
Nate looking so much like nick now he’s getting on a bit 😂
I love him
Nate talks about the UFC like they're the Illuminati 🤣
This has to be the first time ever that I watched a 30 min interview all the way through without understaying whats being said 75% of the conversation. What a true legend, the realest.
Nat the great I hope u Win 🥇 big dog
Diaz army! Love from the Bay Area!
How dare you censor Nate
Nice quality ESPN
Im tempted to put some cash on him. Crazy … maybe … but I want him to win so bad. And if he does 👀👀👀
"You're still *their* champion"...whoa, didn't expect that from him, this is a great interview
CTE
WIN or lose. WE LOVE YOU NATE. TRUE VETERAN OF THE UFC. YOUVE ALWAYS BEEN A NEEDLE M0VER
Most intelligent man even Bret tried to butter him up he straight away hit him with answers
This guy's is gonna get smacked around for 25 minutes, going to get one slap in and smoke a blunt at the post press conference his fans will go nuts
I really hope he spoils the plans. Lets go Nate!
He's brain DAMAGE you can tell when he speaks
Nate and Nick should just start thier own promotion 🤯 just the name alone is a big enough draw
Ariel should have done this interview.
All the same I’ve been saying about khamzat. I said it in another comment and had the Kahnmzat bandwagon go off on me. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
No matter no matter what happens Nate is always going to be the man. And when he wins I won't be surprised
Poor Nate doesn't have 2 brain cells to rub together
Nate diaz is talking subtitle on
I’m concerned nate is serious when he says he would fight ngannou
“if you’re a goat then make a goat” 😳😮‍💨
I like nate but he should get into politics... answers the question without answers the question directly.
I love Nate but I sense like he knows he’s about to get fcked up, fck the ufc for making this his last fight bro
Night just shows and tells how hard it is to get in the UFC
ESPN 720p... Good job guys........
Nate is a beast and khamzat will be very timid this week he knows who riding with the Diaz crew?
He needs to be compensated for all his wars that he's put into this sport! He is the last of the samurai. Love or hate him he puts the best fights and needs to be paid for it. When they are done with you that's it and I know better than anyone. So pay this man his worth!
this fight will not happen"mark my words" IT WILL BE  GILBERT VS KHAMZAT...NATE DOES NOT LOOK HEALTHY
Nate didn’t need someone asking questions making a narrative Nate made this interview what he wanted to do
Let's go Nate!!! I can't wait for you to go to work Saturday night!!!
It was nice nate got to fight in Madison Square garden, but it was those NY officials that were scared & wouldn't let him continue. In Vegas that Jorge fight would have gone 5 rounds..
Nobody ends interviews better than Nate.  Lol!!!
Trying to follow Nate‘s train of thought is like trying to follow a ghost! You think you’re doing pretty good you think you’re following along and then all of a sudden it disappears!🤣😂
I wouldn't mind if Nate tapped at the very start of round 1.  Respect.
Thank you for the memories
this guy is a national treasure
I understand the hype but I have watched every interview Nate Diaz did pre-fight his entire career.  This sounds an awful like the first Connor fight when he stepped in. I’m just saying. Go back and watch it
You should have worked on a computer somewhere you nerd 🤌
his impression of kamaru's got me dead
Nate Diaz almost beat Leon and he was injured? this guy is truly underrated, he was about to turn up vs jorge too
this fight really feels like Nate vs the UFC , and they are trying to make him look as washed up as possible so that when he leaves and fights Jake Paul that Jake will not be able to promote his fight as if he is beating a UFC great,  Jake has been on this whole I beat ufc fighters world tour and they want to make Nate look like he is not a top contender so that if Jake beats Nate they can say he was washed up or that Jake didnt beat a UFC great!  no one is talking about the real reasons this fight is put together,  I own an mma company for 15 yrs , I am a promoter, so I know how some promoters think in terms of protecting themselves from press that suggests they are not the best,  if they make Nate look bad or washed up then if he fights Jake Paul they will not be able to say that Nate is a great, or a legend or a statement Jake is trying to sell!  If Nate was not fullt intending to fight Jake Paul this fight would not be scheduled, just my opinion !
USMAN WOULD DESTROY NATE, NATE IS DELUSIONAL AND CTE BRAIN LOL
Why is this in 720p womp womp
Goddam Nate's scar looks like it's going to open up every time he raises his eyebrows.
Nate and his Brother are the Real deal.  NATE DIAZ sees payday being number 1 or number 2. Nate is down to throw.... Nate is the real deal.
This guy can’t even form a sentence or put a thought together
“You fought burns” diaz talks truth no lies respect
If I ever have kids they will be introduced to the ufc through Nate Diaz
Legend 💯💯💯
Hating on Usman? Punch Drunk 🍻
Nate constantly with his little man syndrome showing with people clearly better than him lol.  Just always comes off a hater.    A HATER.   Rent free with Khabib with every interview and it has nothing to do with him lol.    See you at the funeral Nate.
Sickest interview i seen in a long time
I'm hoping Nate gets the submission after dazing Khamzat with his boxing and leaves the UFC with a big fight of the night bonus!
Gotta love nates usman impression 😄
It goes to show what these guys sacrifice to entertain us. Let’s go Nate!!
This man is the goat he’s real and has been scammed out of a title he’s beat everyone that’s held a title
Screw Dana White for trying to destroy Nate Diaz. Win! Lose or Draw, Chimaev will never ever be the star or The Man that Nate Diaz has been and still is to MMA fans. F#$k all them mf'ers  Nate!
smesh time
Diaz fought Jorge, leon, and now khamzat before any of them fought eachother. Hes speaking faxx 👑🔥💯
An organization this large cant afford to do anything higher than 720p?
If you a goat 🐐 make a goat! Love it!!!
Og
Great interview but maybe 1080 next time....
Nick Diaz Army
Kind of sad this is the last time we will see Nate in a classic ufc interview…
The censoring of swear-words is sooooo lame
He’s  one of the reasons the UFC is hat it is today … Real OG
goat
Sounds like djvlad
bro said i have to go ..lol the goat 🐐
Pressure on you i dgaf 🤣
I feel like both fighters need translators to get their points across. This interview is like the court scene in I Am Sam. You know the part where Sam breaks down on the stand and has a total meltdown?
Nate had his pro card when khamzat was 7  years old.   thats hardcore
Where's the HD?
@20:00 nigganuu 🤣
720p? tf is this 2014?
Remember this Nate has never been KO'd and most the fights he lost were 3 round decision. 3,4,5 are his big rounds. Khamzat better not sleep on Nate.
He's a real G Norte Cali all day ur the people champ my boy!!!
Stepping stone now Nate. You'd have nada if wasn't for UFC. You n your brother
Nate just exposed who really owns the UFC...
nate is a horrible storyteller
Wow shame on the ufc !! It's about making this guy!!
Did Nate call him Brad at the end? Lolol  Great Interview Brad. Lol
Nate is the definition of a gangster
Weed is not good for the future
True Samurai
Bring me Ngannou😂😂😂😂💯. Gotta love him
Diaz brothers are showing cte 110% . Respect for their sacrifice but in 5 or 10 years they dont even recognize each other i guess ..
You’re welcome Abu Dhabi, that was so good and true hahaha
Absolute living legend
I ain’t saying none of that Nate ! We are all going in that cage with you my brother 👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼👊🏼 Kill or be Killed ! Take that foool out
If you want to be the GOAT make a  GOAT 🐐 Nate Diaz Is UFC
Just dont take beating too much i cant wacht that fight
I wish the dream for me soon as the bell starts nate taps on the mat concedes UFC stock goes right down and a big F U
Usman confirmed to be a fake champion
This made me kinda cry
khamza is not an easy man i think he is the next world champion. hopefully
That Nate Diaz logic is unparalleled. It’s truly one of a kind and it’s hilarious to listen to.
Nate is insane. He's great but not the GOAT
this guy is a legend, in a unilimited rounds fight he defenitly kills all the people he lost to by points, real warrior
I love Nate, but this BS about building Chamzat, he's already a star, what are you talking about. Be a gangster and fight a gangster.
Nate “The Goat Maker” Diaz
Only Nate can help make a Brett interview less boring
This guy is great!
A little bit stupid guy, but we love our little bit stupid guy. Wish you victory Nate, OG UFC fans all got your back
Nate is the goat 🐐 no doubt
Nate Mike Tyson Diaz
Diaz has my respect. But I'm also concerned about his long term health. Frankly, I think Dana is trying to get him hurt really bad on his way out the UFC Door!
Fighters vs UFC this year are 0 and 2
Good luck in ur upcoming fight Nate. All the best from the uk. EDIT He's 100% right. This is all about the UFC trying to steal his shine for another fighter. Don't play their game Nate Jujitsu this mdrfkr.
All respect to Diaz but thank u for subtitles! Best way to round up a interview ive ever seen!
Legendary; every time the God speaks its prolific👁🐉
I sure hope you beat chimaev !! Let's go Nate !!
Why does he look sad :(
Can't wait for Nate's fight promotion . Picture Eagle and Rebel promotions going forces,  the UFC would be fkd.
“If you’re Mr. Goat, then make another Goat”. - the greatest fighter to ever live.🐐
Is he the Joe Biden of the UFC??
hall of fame plz for the diaz brother
What is going on in this interview.? I love Nate to the fullest breaks my heart we got older with him..  now I just try to keep up with what he is saying.. I mean is his head ok ? It just sucks man !!
Nates the man hahaha how can you not like him
Gotta love Nate!!
Joe Biden
Need an Interview with Ariel before fight day to the rest of emotions going.
That was an awesome interview
Gottta love Nate man
"You fought burns dogg...you fought burnnss.." 🤣🤣🤣
Did Nate say the N word at 23:56
Interviewer: Why do you think its Khamzat Chimaev you're fighting this weekend? Nate: 15 mins of straight rambling about absolutely nothing  Interviewer: Mhm mhm mhm
It’s like in his head, his thoughts are clear and it makes perfect sense. But, when he tries to convey his thoughts and/or articulate his words so it makes sense to you & me, he can’t find the sequence or the vocabulary. However, if you listen closely, the truth is in there. Nate is far from stupid.
He’s a winner.
That exit 🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂
Let’s go Nate!! Beat that overrated bearded gargamel looking mothe fucka
Nate Diaz is just too bitter imagine how good he could’ve been if he stopped hanging with the homeboys and quit smoking weed
Last 10 mins were hilarious and entertaining 😂😂😂
High moments ..... hahhaha
Nate is a warrior till the last breathe.. I don't want to see this fight.. it's not right.. he's paid his dues.. they should have given him an easy fight.. He took too many shot to the head.. the damage is apparent in his speech.. I'm not saying he won't go in there and bring a war, im saying he shouldnt..
DIAZ ARMYYY 💣💣💣
This interview is a case study in what happens to athletes who follow a career in MMA.  CTE, brain cognition/memory issues.  Dana White does not care what happens long term.  He says 'this is the game' and 'fighters know what they're getting in to'.  Fighters have no idea...and will silently suffer just like NFL players (who are two or three decades down the road at this point).  Give the fighters long term health care!
First 8 min. No idea what's going on in this conversation
So apparently UFC refused to sign all the guys with training with nate That's why nate didn't resign the contract... OG
This is the best interview with nate diaz I love that the interviewer just let him talk and not cut him off. Those are the interviewers that I actually respect.
I do like Nate and always have but I tend to feel like am on mushrooms when I watch his interviews.
Nate Diaz is a legend.
“I’ll fight them all in five seconds” -Nate Diaz   That’s some Goat talk 💪🏼
I feel bad for this camera guy. You need 5 cameras on Nate lol
12:45 he the most confused and scared mf lol
2:00 Lmao Brett knows nothing about MMA
Nate is REAL ASF!!! The DIAZ BROTHERS are as REAL as they come.  I hope Nick will be in Nate’s corner during the fight.
Nate Diaz wins by KO.
Massive Sandler shout
Disney money camera quality
😂 this guy is hilarious 😂 the world needs to protect Nate Diaz at all cost 😂
I don;t know this guy says,but I;ve seen him fighting with the best. Same thing for Khamzat who I am a fan of. This means we are about to watch two of the best of this sport, each one them in a different angle of their carreer. Good luck to you guys we love you both. Only to be there great respect for both honestly,
CTE BRAIN...17:59....CTE BRAIN FOR SURE, IT'S SO CLEAR, DANA CUT THIS DUDE LOSE ALREADY BEFORE HE DIES
This isn’t going to go well. Nick Diaz vibes
Why is Nate Diaz so terrible at talking it’s so weird listening to him it’s like he don’t know how to explain things is he just so nervous
Great interview! I'm shattered he left I could've watched this for hours. This fight is huge! The two names and where they're at in the career. Both fighting for different reasons. Two proper gangsters about to fight in the highest level.
He’s so funny he said u have to sign 10 of my friends and I’ll sign? Who’s the friends you might ask? The crackhead from down the street
is anyone going to mention that he cannt get a sentence out. love em but too much damage has been done.  CTE is a real thing
720p really? This is ESPN right?
Nate is the only Gangsta in UFC, demanding the UFC to sign 10 of his Homies or he walks🤣
Keep doing your thing bro. You been a people's champion since u came in the UFC. So many epic battles bro. Wish you all the best
nate knows the fight game
Why are these videos such low resolution? Can we please export at a higher fidelity please?
Nate's gonna win round 2. He has too much of a chip on his shoulder. Just hope he doesn't get a medical stoppage from the scar tissue.
I've never seen Nate this unsettled. No good
Love this guy, but he's braindead
Spoke facts
Can't wait for that entrance song Nate 😎🤜🏻🤛🏻
nate got eyes in the bk of his head to see if khamzat is coming lol
Bret is the worst  i have ever seen
He is as genuine as it gets…
Conor vs Nate trilogy should have been Nates last fight 😤
He has either been hit too many times or he is on something. Absolutely no way he walks out of the ring after Chimaev. They'll be dragging his unconscious body off the mat.
Let’s go nate
Such a great interview I could listen to him all day
One of the greats. Can’t wait to watch this fight go Diaz❗️
Legend!!! The man who introduced me to the UFC! Thank you Nate! I know your going to shock the world Saturday night!
Diaz all the way no matter what!
Let’s go nathan let’s go brother
You make no sense
Omg this guy has been hit so many times ! It’s so hard to understand what he’s trying to say! I don’t think he knows what he’s saying! Stop fighting dude you are got out ! Stop smoking bruh it’s killing the little brain cells you have or had
Nate, the whole world is with you man 👊🏻
22:05 “bunch of nerds” 😂
For fucks sake, stop censoring the video. These people punch each other yet you cant handle a few fuciing curse words?
Nate to me is the best of all time.
Best Nate interview evert! Diaz is the MMA GOAT!!
"My career was based on..."   Nate Diaz.   That tells me all I need to know. I think in his heart of hearts Nate knows he's really up against it this time. That's hard to hear, but ultimately, Nate is the embodiment of the old adage "It's not if you win or lose, it's how you play the game."  Nate will always be  a master of the game.
The epitome of Sigma Male.
He was a little quiet at first but then opened the flood gates. This was a great interview Brett I have to go!
My prediction is that Nate will get beat up for 4 rounds then he submits khamzat in the 5th
No Dana white privilege here lady's 🙅🏽‍♂️
Nick Diaz Army STAND UP! We gotta get behind our boy. I started watching nick and nate in 2005. And still to this day root for them every time they make any move. I'm blessed to have lived in the Era of nick and nate diaz. It's truly been an honor. Let's go nate.
Nate is and always will be a Legend
Nate, train the left high kick, he is gonna over extend with right hand pressure and you can sleep him cuz he won’t expect it from you.
Stockton 3
Dana is a sell out.
Dude sounds so lost lolol
Nat ❤✌💪
My head hurts trying to understand what Nate is saying. He needs to stay off the weed. Finish a sentence for once Nate!!
Brett and his void questions. Come on bro gear up! No hard feelings.   Thankfully Nate carried the whole thing and decided when to close it up lol
The sound quality fn suck turn up the vol
Diaz army babbyyyyyy!!!!! Let's gooooo
Awesome fight week for the ret@rds!!!
I don't know it's might wrong but I can clearly see fear in the eyes of Nate. It might end up very brutal for him. I hope if Khamzat win fight will end very early I can't see that Guy smesh badly like many other fights.
MMA legend. & thats whats up! 💪
nate is going to get smashed, ufc is sick of his whining so they put him in with this  monster to END his career in the ufc. bye nate
Talk about punch drunk. It’s Nate and Tonys funeral. Shame on UFC for allowing this to happen.
Has horrible record. Tons of losses. Claims goat status. Makes Diaz sense, I guess.
(Moment of silence)....."This was a great interview"I have to  go" 🤣🤣🤣 cameoutta nowhere!!! GOTTA LOVE HOW NATES STRAIGHT TO THE POINT N BLUNT!!!
The realest fighter in the game.
"a bunch of nerds", facts
Man he seems not to be speaking the way he use too.. that's tough love Nate !!
We really doing 720p?
Nate Diaz is the TRUTH! Real recognize real.
If your mr goat, make a goat
Nate Diaz is King of the UFC.
No amount of steroids could make Nate Diaz good enough to beat Anderson Silva.
Nate.... I fully had your back.... 100% had your back!!!..... up until you mentioned 1 name.... Fedor. Enough said.
Hope he use steroids for the chimaev fight 🙏
Nate is feeling the pressure,  i hope it makes him stronger and pull off the win.
I REALLY THINK NATE IS GOING TO TAKE HIM OUT.
8:09 *THATS HOW YOU DO THAT!*
Those r the guys?? I’ll fight all of them in 5 seconds 😂😂
<3 Nate
Now , who is bigger? Nate or Nick? Even though nate gives nick always the edge. Nate brought the big money home and made much bigger things like humbling conor.
"I got so high I thought about running for mayor,  slapped myself to make sure I was still there."- Nate Diaz
I refuse to be lame sums up Nate Diaz who's been a gem for the sport and UFC a true fighter who comes to fight not to compete an edge out a win. But to show a real fight
Worst image definition I've seen from a top channel in a long time.
Legend.
Best mma interview I have ever seen.
9:50 , 18:00 nate has a great Kamaru Usman impression 😂
"That fight (with Leon) was the easiest fight I've had, and he's the champ"
Nate is too full of his own self-pity.  He says he wasn't given a title shot... I don't understand. He fought Benson for the lightweight strap on 2012. His prime. Despite having a 16/7 record. Then he was given top contenders and he fell off. The competition was too stiff for his one way reliance on durability🧟 + stamina🏊. and his basic 1-2 combinations. He doesn't have Charles Bjj👐, He doesn't have Dustin's/Justin's power👊, he doesn't have conor's precision🤛, he doesn't have chandlers physique💪 and he DEFINITELY  doesn't have Khabib's wrestling🤝. All these guys proved he was swiss cheese.  Sure vs cowboy🤠 he won but cowboy is a basic fighter🤏 as well...  The truth is he got outclassed. And he needs to get off the ego and admit that he isn't "the best" as he claims.
You all will flame Me, but, it looks and sounds like Nate is really bothered by this whole thing. Like emotionally. Never thought I'd see him so emotionally vulnerable. One of the best ever but it sucks to see him like this.
BRAIN DAMAGE
Nate being Delusional as always 🤣🤣😂
Jesse on fire explains this interview perfectly on why diaz is the champ and the champions now are not
No Rounds... No Time limit... and _then_ lets see who the real "Champs" are.  That's the point.
He reminds me of Mike tyson when he is talking.
I love Nate's outlook on this whole situation that he's up against when the odds are against him in the media eyes and other fighters eyes but in Nate's eyes hes his own champion. That right there is what really matters win or lose nates won already.
STAY IN SCHOOL! IGNORE THE MEDIA TRYING TO PROMOTE GET MONEY MENTALITY.
I hope The UFC media!, And commentators pay Nate the respect he deserves this week. And the fighters! Use are are all fans. Soo if this is his last fight in UFC give him his respect. I mean all his highlights, talking about what his done, everything. Cause the best fights I've ever watched involved either Nate or Nick Diaz. Pay them there due's
Real recognize real we got ur back Nate f the corporate America
Mike Tyson and nate Diaz are the two interviews that you have to talk with respect to them. Or get slapped.
Hall of Fame!! For sure both Diaz Bothers!! NDA!!! All Day!!
Nate is the realest person on the UGC roster, what they are doing to him is so F up! With that being said, I hope Nate knocks this dude out!
NATE HAS CTE AND AFTER KHMAZAT DESTROYS HIM, HE WILL HAVE BRAIN DAMAGE FOR REALZ😅
Ufc just disrespect him man
All love to Nate man but dude he looks rough right now and to top it off hes gotta fight khamzat... I feel like this is gonna end very badly for him.. I pray he makes it out ok and goes onto live a good life but it doesn't look good man.
Amazing interview nate is the realest ever 👊😎
Love the guy but slightly deluded on statements ive got khamzat but if Nate caused upset I'd be impressed
Love Nate, wish he wasn't fighting anymore.  too old, too much damage.
I was kinda hoping he would ask nate if they were worried about the scar tissue opening up again and the doctor stopping the fight, and what the strategy is to avoid it opening up too badly.
You do steroids… I’ll smoke weed 💀
720p???
Could you imagine after nate loses Dana hires him as a ring side commentator for fights.  Nate calling the fights.  "Uum ahh yep look listen it's like um yeah an giving hand signs like people can hear it. 😆  English is khamzats 3rd language an you can understand him more then Nate. That's the real reason he never got a title shot. Bc he can't hold a actual thought more then 5 seconds.  When you already don't have more then 5 brain cells probably shouldn't smoke so much. Not because the Marijuana makes you dumb but you make other stoners look bad.
Dope interview. The last of the real ones. Hopefully this isn’t his last walk
I won't see the fight May he get win .
"This was a Great interview Bret, I gotta Go" - Nate Diaz 🤣😂
The UFC should have made -Nate Diaz vs charles oliveira,  or Nate Diaz vs Tony Ferguson !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That is the FAN FIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“Jon jones”  “WHO?”😂🤣
720p more like 480...
I love nate but he doesnt unterstand that the value of a fighter decreases by time... thats the problem
We need a Diaz Brothers movie man and I don't even watch that many movies but I'd watch theirs multiple times just like I watch blood in blood out hundreds of times.But keep it true to who they are don't add any bs that didn't happen their story is already much more intriguing than anything Hollywood can come up with I would only watch if they're involved in making it too and if they ever do make a movie about them they better not do them dirty like they did Tyson js
Jesus he has been punched too many times that was a painful watch!!!
I guess him and tyson buys weed from the same dealer..but anyway they both legends 🙌
Nate Diaz is a legend. Legends never die. S
Unintentionally hilarious, this interview,guys a legend.
DIAZ ARMY
205
Nate is the ONLY fighter in history that will keep me 10000% glued to the screen watching and listening to every detail, while having my heart race as I only imaging how huge Saturday will be! Win or lose!
Nates the type of 'real' we need in this area we live in.... wake up
Can we stop pretending that more than half of this is conversation is understandable
The GOAT!!!!!
ESPN MMA 720p?
I will allways remember him slapping people and laying on the ground waiting for Anderson Silva.
Hot take, if Nate stayed at 155 and was more committed to MMA he had the potential to be a champ, not over khabib but at his full potential he could probably beat rda, pettis or alvarez during their championship reigns
Somewhere in a alternate universe Nate Diaz was ufc champion
His Usman impersonation is on point lol
Much love Nate
This guy is the best at interviewing, he kept his mouth shut and let Nate drop gold lol
Love you NATE, THE REALEST DUDE IN THE SPORT HANDS DOWN
Such weird disrespect towards Oliveira for no reason lol tf
Nate is the best EVER THE GOAT hands down period the end
why is a nate diaz interview in 720p?
Loves fighting hates the business. UFC uses the Diaz bros names to raise the stock of other fighters. They fight anyone anywhere.
Volume too low. Please increase your volume
I'm not surprised motherfuckers!!!
I'm going to miss this guy when he's gone ! For sure !
We need a hotboxing mike Tyson and nate. Tyson said he couldn’t understand how Muhammad Ali was willing to die in there. Nates of the same ilk. Kill or be killed Diaz army 💯⚒
A legend in his own mind! Rodney Dangerfield
It's hard to watch his interviews. He's a fun fighter and he's very tough but sheesh.
Nate the realist 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Put some respect on this man’s name you bums
I really hoping to hear this words,.,.  I’M NOT SURPRISE MF’S… go Team Diaz
God Bless the Diazs!!!!!!!!!!
Dammit ! Anyone but Brett, he stinks.
What a legend man. If there is a god he needs to throw one Nates way!
This was a dope interview.
Nate winning this fight by submission
I love this guy man
Fcuk everybody else.
i wanna see a nate diaz biopic starring adam sandler
Okamoto is so cringe man.
CTE is a hellavu drug
In a standup fight diaz would win because of his years of experience and endurance, but khamzat of course will take it to the ground and his power in wrestling will be too much for nate i  think
The peoples Champion 🏆💪🏽
The fact that they had Ferguson On the fight directly before Nate’s , on the SAME card but not Fighting each other is The most blatant Sign that They Do not care about the fighters , obviously they are the top Organization in MMA so it’s about business before anything. But seriously Dude . There were 5 guys off the Top of my head they could’ve made for this card they Really just wanted to use Chimaev to Bury Nate on his way out that’s all it is to it , Nate Vs Robbie would’ve made more sense , Nate Vs Ferguson, Since he’s going to WW anyway, You wanna Give him Ranked fights? Okay Bryan Barberena , Luque , or Wonderboy would’ve been Easy fights to book They all would’ve taken that fight , It’s be much more fair , receptions from fans would be Exciting & if they’d built the card right , you gotta easy 1 million PPV buys
Him n bro should write or publish an autobiography
Its hilarious when coked up Dana tried to get into his face at that afterparty 🤣
Baddest dude in the UFC.  Colby comes in at #2.
I'm so lost listening to this poor soul.
The one and only. NATE DIAZ
Nick Diaz army!!!!! Lesssgo muthafuckas!!
Diaz lives in the past a lot
This was a really good interview! Nate real as always!!
Crème della cream 😝wth
Going to war with the org.
Nate is the man!
What Nate is trying to say is the UFC doesnt promote him as well as they should.  Hes been fighting the very top meta of fighters generation after generation after generation and hes always just promoted as the next challenge for the next new rising star fighters to step over.  And then after they fluff this new fighter up, they come and go for a short while and collect tons of fame and promotion, whereas Nate has been doing it for triple the time at triple the difficulty. They never promote Nate as "the fkn man" like he deserves.  And yet the new fresh guys get all of the glory and extra praise when they have NOT been fighting the META of top 10 fighters generation after generation.
For as much respect as I have for the legacy of the Diaz brothers, there's no better example of an irrelevant fighter that's still on PPV.
Nate Diaz is the kind of guy that would give a final FU to the UFC by finishing Chimaev
Best nate interview i ever seen
Nate is a philosopher
That cte is cringe
Instead of complaining and accepting defeat even before the fight, I think, it will be  best to  Prove them wrong that your the cham,  and can't be bullied by someone personal interest! Once a champ always a champ.
Some great perspective shared, and great to see Nate letting loose and being so transparent about his situation. I wonder if Khamzat will just go for round one ground and pound or sub finish or decide to ego fight Diaz
This was an amazing interview Brett but I gotta go 😂
I'm excited for this one, I haven't been this excited in a while too! I hope nate can find a way to not get KO'd 🙏 he's gotta fight a perfect fight to get the win. But if anyone can do it, it's you Diaz. "Hey, it doesn't surprise my mother fuckers"
This interview looks like a therapy session lmao
I dont like this interviewer, he is cringe af
Spoken like a true G
This guy knows.
Big respect to Nate ! Just pure Genuine. Good Luck with your fight brother
26:46 (pause) that’s the most Nate has ever looked like Nick, that I’ve ever seen. 🤯
Happy he mentioned Fedor.
I'm not surprised mother fers!
The ramblings of a pot head.
Man what’s up with this quality
Nate’s gonna sub him
Till the wheels fall of
Is it me or did he ask him the same question at least 10 fkn times
People's champ... 🔥🔥🔥 💪😤🌱
Does Nate eat a slice of pizza and then looks around and then asks “yo where did my pizza go?”
“ You fought Burns dog you fought Burns “
Bro I have no idea what he just said
This absolutely was a good interview. Love the way HE ended the interview ahahahaha what a baller
Let’s go Nate win or lose just make the world laugh at kumshot slap him a few times your winner either way
I didnt like this. Nate acts a little bit like Nick when he says he didnt ask for this fight and that's a bad sign. He seems more stressed and anxious then normal. Hope he has his cardio on point and still makes it without getting K.Oed
Usman was champion for over 3 years with 5 almost 6 successful title defenses. Against the best in the world in his division, give the man his respect.
By far my number one favorite UFC fighter of all time!!! One more time Nate!!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸💪🏽
A strong wrestler Vs Bjj is like Grass🍃 vs Water💧
Nathan is a legend..I will always tune in to watch him go to war...Show the world who the real ninja is..
Fck the hatersNate. Showm wats up .💪✊🙏.
Usman beat everyone in the top 10 basically… some twice 😂 - I love Nate
This guy is something different!!!
Rolling with Nate regardless! 💪🏾
love Diaz
I'm tired of acting like the UFC didn't get rid of Nick FOR 5 YEARS TO PROTECT THEIR CHAMPS FROM NICK. THEN MADE HIM FIGHT HURT AFTER A 5 YEAR LAYOFF
Diaz Army all day. When he wins I will shout loudly "Not surprised mother fuckers!!!"
WAR DIAZ from day one
This guys delirious, smh.  Always whining, talking about nobody beat him, he's the Champ, untouchable blahzay blahzay.
Did they forget, even the people who have seen a Nate interview still need subtitles? 😆
Nate said what the other 100 are scared to say! When he walk’s away this weekend a part of UFC walk’s away he gave us a chunk of his life!  Thank you
Was this filmed on an iphone 4?
Education is important...
Nate with a chip on his shoulder is a very dangerous man...
The realist.
Nate is just a dog man real fighter  UFC just disrespected him not letting him pick who to fight
I just love Nate and nick diaz.. diaz bros rocks ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Nate is really “too real for this sport”
Nate got the whole world on his back let's go baby
Khamzat just started, so talk to me in ten years and see if we even remember the kid's name. Nate's a f***ing legend and always will be.
nothing but love and respect for you Nate. we'll be riding with you till the wheels fall off brother.
It would be amazing to see Nate pull this off 🙏
Diaz definitely got Mike Tyson vibes about him
I feel ya Nate! Dropping some truth bombs here. There are the “real ones” & then the wannabe’s, you a real one G, go show ‘em how it’s done bro. ✊🏼
Hope Diaz wins ! He’s the realest ever !
I can feel his irritation…..I get it too. He being short for reason. Dana doesn’t even realize how much money he’s gonna lose once Diaz leaves I guarantee you they haven’t offered him another contract
I was instigating dat lmao
I love that Nate got that Chip on his shoulder. It's that Jordan/Kobe mindset. His awareness is Key. This fight has upset written all over it. Nate been here before, Khazmat hasn't. If he wins, the contract the UFC will come back with will probably make him the highest paid fighter. I don't feel sorry for Nate at all. This man the realist one on the pack 💯
People must have forgot the wins this man has on his resume when he began his career he went on a tear beating everyone up and till this day only fights top contenders and yet has never been knocked out cold or submitted ..
I refuse to be lame 😂😂😂
Nate’s the real gangster . 4th or 5th rd submission . Diaz brothers are legends of this game , guys can you honestly imagine if Nate wins , what that would do too Dana? Dana literally said whoever wins this fight is next up for title . He’s been pushing khamzat so much and wants him next for the title . It would ruin all his and lol . Come on Nate!!!!!
They misunderstood, & hard for them to put things in words, which is why him and his brother are FIGHTERS. But in that cage they're poets, poets in motion. 👌🏿💯🙏🏿
Nate I'm rooting for u bro
he is sad that he knows going to crushed and he doesn’t deserve to go out like that
Nate stoned af🤣
Cain Velasquez
I think this interviewer likes Nate more than Khamzat 👀 he was being annoying in the other interview 😂
“Fador malinko”  -Nate Diaz
"This was a great interview, Ill see you next time"  So youre telling me theres a chance!!?
That Usman impression was on point lol
Nate has always been the guy to STEP up and fight who ever, no excuses. I think Nate could win via taking it to the ground, I think his ground game is a lot superior than Khazmat, but he can box to so we will see.
Brett must have felt a bit odd
Nate Diaz keeps throwing out that word "War". I don't think an MMA fight with rules qualifys. OIF, OEF, Ukraine......these are war's.  These guys are doing SPORT.
This is going to end very badly for him, first round ko easy
The first guy to shut conor up
gonna miss him wen he retires we need guys like the diaz bros they dont come round very often respect
He looks and sounds baked as a mofo…. Or maybe it’s the CTE kicking in.
The way he slurs you can tell something’s wrong with the man. Full of heart and talented… unfortunately not enough to be HOF, IMO. Too many times getting his nugget turned into a potato just for one Stockton Slap. I hope he’s invested his money wisely and has a great future ahead in retirement. His brother was always better.
I love this man!!!
I can see the pain on his face and in his words. There's a lot going on here. I wish Nate all the best inside and outside of the UFC. Time to sharpen the blades and go to war ⚔🔥
Imagine Diaz wooping Chimaev, gets a title shot vs Edwards following their first fight where Diaz had him hurt for a sec there at the end, Diaz finishes him this time, becomes Champion, and fucks off forever
Such an amazing and honest guy but what a ugly end he'll have it's just inevitable that he'll get knocked out in the first, it requires a tone of heart to fight someone like Khamzat Chimaev and that too in different weight. Thank you nate for all the memories I wish you hadn't signed this fight.
I have nothing against this guy but I’m mystified as to why Americans idolise him so much. He seems like man with a fork in a world of soup. Nothing is ever good, everyones always against him and its always negative. Dont get it tbh
I really hope Nate wins some kinda way. But more I hope he can remember his name in 10 years
I hope Nate surprises us this weekend. Dude deserves the success. He's 100% correct that the pressure is all on Chimaev.
Tryin' to get contracts for all his boys. Nate's a true friend.
Nate wouldnt say anything bad about Dana. He left the casuals disappointed.
15:20 it’s mad but Nate Diaz is maybe the only guy that I could believe wouldn’t know his opponents name in a ppv headliner
Diaz may not be able to properly articulate his thoughts, but he's not near as dumb as people make him out to be. He sees right through the UFC.
Nate Diaz needs subtitles
"You should have worked on a computer somewhere you nerd." -Nate Diaz
Nate is the best man. Thanks for all the years.
gonna lose another decision and complain. i hate being a modern fan of diaz i miss old diaz, not people are too good for him. and fighting a natural welterweight what is he thinking? even leon is kinda small for a welterweight and he beat diaz every round.....rory threw diaz around like a child and so did RDA.
Plz Nate somehow get this done
Brett is 37 that dude must not drinking alcohol at all
He really said he beat leon
I respect nate for calling out the fans who think jones and silva are in the goat conversation after steroids usage...this is only sport where the users are brought into the goat conversation...yeah steroids don't give you skills ..but gives you the physical base to showcase these skills...
LIKE if wanna see a tsunami of STOCKTON SLAPS 👋👋👋
DIAZ going to smack the shi# out of Khamzat,     Khamzat is going to be so stunned and surprised by the Stockton smack that it will be over!! 💯 after the smack time to go to 💥💤💤🛌  The Illuminati will be watching 👁 so will 💀 and bones.  Khamzat will soon be wearing a 💋💅 and a 👗 carrying a 👜with 💄nate going to play him like a 🎻 and fold him like an 🪗. Khamzat is nothing but a 🪛🔧 and nate is the gate keeper with the 🔑❗ nate will light that 🔥and Khamzat will see ⭐⭐"s. the DIAZ BOYS are 🐯🦁🐻💣💣💯!
The Best
Pure rubbish none of it makes any sense
I love Nate but he's sounding punch drunk when he talks. Going off topic and trying to remember what he was talking about.
If your a GOAT make a GOAT SO FREAKING TRUE👊
NDA for life!
If your Mr goat then make a goat #🐐talk
Brett : So why you're still doing it? Nate : That's what i do! My man will go down in history as a real G!
I totally love Nate ,he made the UFC!!!!!! There's nobody else like him !
Brett stop sitting like you’re trying to Fuk Nate
God Bless the subtitles!!!
Im a Khamzat fan but I'm going to be honest. I WANT NATE TO WIN.   OG!
shittiest interviewer ever
Hate this interviewer his attitude sucks
nick and Nate army till we die
“You’re welcome.” 🐐
Lol this is why you don't do drugs people...
I got Nate winning I felt every thing he said! I just hope he don’t get cut early 🤦🏾‍♂️ chimave ?!? Or whatever his name is should gas himself out lol😏
Legendary interview
Diaz is trippen Oilvera and Usman and Leon beat the best UFC didn't say anything but match make dude hasn't won in forever
WarDiaz Always
When you look up fighter in the dictionary it should show a picture of NATE 🥊👍
Leon beat you, Nate, but I agree that Nick's a better fighter.
remember when NICK made the UFC sign his buddy, then he got KOed in 5 seconds
Hall of fame
Big up set coming nate winning by submission... He seems very terrified at the same time
This one of the best interviews ive ever watched !!!!!🤣🐐💯
"This was a great interview Brett but I have to go"
Thank you Nate Diaz! You're the man! beat khazmat
Its clear to see he gave this interview with a heavy heart. A true warrior. Chin up, you got this Nate 💯                                            🖕🖕
Love Fedor Malenko
Gotta talk to Nate a certain way. Not someone who likes to talk about his feelings
Shoulda worked on a computer ya nerd! 😂
This interview will go down in history!
Living legend right there
Did u guys film this on an old nokia phone ?? video quality looks super choppy.
Honestly love nate man but a lot of the takes his has in this interview are just straight delusional, saying he coasted and easiest fight he ever had vs Leon is ridiculous, aswell as the self proclaimed best fighter like cmon man most top 10 guys beat him handily
WAR DIAZ
These stockton fighters are a different breed.
War diaz
Nate Diaz coming like John Wick oh my days
You guys…Khamzat is in trouble…
Nate Diaz happy retirement
Nate: I'm the goat 🐐 of the UFC, besides my brother. I'm the best fighter ever. I'm the president of the UFC! I almost beat up Dana. Great interview. I have to go.
Agree with the PEDs on JJ. JOHN JONES is out of the GOAT talk
He’s right most fighters careers are short. They lose 3 straight and they are shown the door most of the time, especially if they were champs or contenders.
Nate Diaz:  UFC since 2004.   👏  Nate -  _'Everthing feels like the other Day'_
Proud member of the Diaz army since 2003.  WAR!!!! I tear up.  Proud!  Real fighters. !!! Don't fight to win fight to destroy
Give the Chechen a good old fashioned Stockton slap!!!,... that's all that matters!!!
Legit
"Khamzat is a rookie he cant beat me." Nate Diaz --- All his fans "They're setting him up to be killed." Boo hoo
Nate saying Francis Ngannou with a serious face is amazing.
is it just me or is audio low
This dude said nuthin but facts
His head is getting bigger. it happens to all of us men
Why are all of Brett's ESPN interviews have shitty quality.  It's only Brett's interviews.   Weird
Lmao “ you do steroids and I’ll smoke weed and we’ll scrap “ Diaz is such a OG  You are one of the GOATS for sure , you’re a legend of this sport .
The realist Nate is the GOAT 🐐
“I refuse to be lame” Nate Diaz
I Love you Nate, my homie, you the realist M Effer, a straight up killer, a warrior, a champion, and a legend. Much Love and Respect to you sir.
"I refuse to be lame" - Nate Diaz
Let’s go Nate Diaz Stockton in da house  real og
Basically Nate is sayin the UFC turns goats into sheep .
23:33 = Jone... who? 😂✊
Brett might be the worst guy ever making this interviews.  Always looks so cringe.
Nate I'm a great fan, but please when you fight please put your hands up covering your face,you got it all but you expose you face to much,then you win a say f#$I the ufc
True statement by Nate saying “ I’m the Champion of the whole UFC.
It’s so funny when they call him Nigganou
Spitting facts.
Brett Okamoto is arguably the best interviewer in MMA. 🙌
I love how Ariel and Brett know you just gotta be quiet for awhile and let Nate rant when interviewing him, Diaz will drop gems out of nowhere after rambling about nothing
Dude makes little to no sense.
Poor Nate 😂😂😂
Nate’s the man
“You should have worked on a computer you nerd” LMAO! I think he is talking about Usman!
Diaz wheres black t shirt a lot. What does that mean
Legend right there.
Seemed emotionally finally leaving. W nate fr
Everyone in the comments cry’s on Saturday….Nate dies on Saturday
Nick was my favorite back in the day. So crazy that his little brother would carry the torch as far as he did. Respect.
I hope nate wins
I'll always support Khamzat. He's repping my home town, but ain't no way I can celebrate a win over Nate on saturday.
Please watch on YouTube....Nick and Nate Diaz The Perfect Role Models. If you are real Diaz fans I promise this is a must see.
Nate Diaz is washed I’m sorry nothing he says makes sense. It sounds good and he has some valid points but no. Sorry bud. You had a good career but not a great one. You will be remembered but not even close to the greatest.
NDA mofos
ESPN needs better cameras
Nate is The People’s champ. The champ of the locker room as well.
I can’t wait for this press conference . I hope he gives it to khamzat . Then I hope khamzat comes out fighting with emotion and  Diaz gets it past second round and wins cause khamzat gasses out after 2nd or 3rd. Diaz 4th or 5th rd submission
Nate needs some stem cells. And shrooms
"I refuse to be lame." - Nate Diaz Best end to an interview I've seen!  Nate is Victorious already!
Great interview. Thanks
why would you censor this
Khamzat will destroy him. Can’t wait 😊 his big mouth will be quiet forever. Our Russian guys are the best on this planet. End of story.
Deep interview. The  Shady business practices of the UFC make it hard for me to support to brand and watch the fights. Glad he's shining a light on everything 💪💪💪💪👽🙏☮️🌞🦋👽🛸🧘🏽‍♂️♾️🌳
So charismatic
I'm surprised nate could stay coherent for 30 minutes 😂
They called Fedor The Last Emperor and that was cute. But Nate is truely the last of the Golden Generation. The true complete fighter, moulded from history. Mixed emotions.
The damage he recived in MMA is catching up to him ,man can barely talk. I hope i'm wrong
They should have given him Francis Ngannou. If he is going to retire let him go with a bang. There are no regrets when you lose to a better man (Francis Ngannou).
3 words: CTE
Diaz is plus 800 vs chimaev that should tell you how good Diaz is … literally the only hope he has is later rounds when his opponents are exhausted from beating the fuk out of him during the first three rounds
The UFC making you their fall guy, Nate knows they are after his Kudos and Prestige they are hoping it is like the saying goes You Keep What You Kill like in the Movie Roddick they are afraid of loosing your World Wide Crew and Khamzat with his soldiers were out trying to steal some of Paulo Costa who was only with one guy but was not afraid at all, so I doubt if he got any, Khamzat will be worried after being beat by Gilbert but getting the decision
We all know how the ufc did you man. Your loved out here.
Nate, you have more fans than haters. You don't have to prove anything to anyone Champ. You are the realest to ever do it.
This felt like a therapy session
Anyone know whatsup with him? Stress from cutting weight, head damage from being the biggest tank in the ring, or what? I love the guy, just hope hes not turning into tyson.  He started speaking much better as the interview went on, but it felt weird the first few minutes
Love you always brother god bless the Diaz brothers 🙏🏼
Thug life brother. We have trained athletes and fighters and we have trained killers and tough men like Nate. I'm 100% sure they both gonna give eachother a very hard time. But Nate's cardio level is outta this world. His ground work is spot on and he has an iron chin. So khamzat is going to have a very hard time in the octagon.
Volume so low
LAST TIME HE FOUGHT HERE HE UPSET CONOR!?!?!???!??? NATE BY SUB!
Brooo I ain’t never jumping on that Kum Shot  I ain’t never gonna jump ships against Nate g Diaz
“I refuse to be lame”
Is Brett trying to seduce Nate? 👀
Maybe being the last fight he feels like the end is coming. He doesn't wants it to end.
NATE IS CHAMP!!! lol LFG
"I'M THE CHAMPION OF THE WHOLE UFC!! F#@K IT!!" - NATE DIAZ
33:21 Nate Diaz 👏
Was this shot on a phone from 2005? ESPN doesn't have the budget for a decent camera ?
My old school marine boxing coach taught me you standup when you shake a man’s hand. When Nate stood up Brett should have too.
The real champ here. Legend. Well done Bret for letting Nate flow and open up.
"People don't know what an Usman is anyway" - Nate Diaz
If your mr goat then make a goat 🐐. 🤯
This dude is the stone cold Steve Austin of the ufc
If this nate shows up, he's done in round 1
Well...I'm after putting my mortgage and every penny IV saved up on Diaz to submit chimnaev
This was a little hard to follow at times but he made his message clear. He’s a fighter. Other fighters took a business journey. He took a war journey. They made deals. He made fights. He’s always been about the fight. That’s all no more no less. I really respect him for making that clear. We all already knew that but I agree with him on the way they are trying to use him as a chess piece for Khamzat. Good luck Nate. Go and do what you were born today.
He is a good decent fighter but to say he was the best in the ufc......one word ...delusional
Man was der fürn scheiß zusammenlabert
Even if Nate lose 20 in a row  I’ll still watch any card Nate on it that’s just the facts
Hate or love Nate Diaz he’s a fighter In every sense of the word 💯
Brett has a really amazing way of connecting with Nate in a way that no other media figure is able to, truly awesome to see this side of Nate.
We need captions for this, not even being funny
This is the best fighter interviews I’ve ever seen
You da best!
Ratings mean nothing because Diaz is above them.  I absolutely love this man.  There is nothing else to be said.
Nate is my favorite fighter of all time. Big Respect Nate always been genuine real.
Brett loves talking about what Diaz is feeling.
Nate found Mike tysons secrets mushroom stash before this interwiev...
We are all behind u nate and pulling for u.. u got this dude.. I'm not surprised motha f**ker
5:58 I am actually friends with Fedor Emilyanenko... very unusual guy in person... different frequency... if you know what I mean...
He should walk out with , it’s just me against the world from 2 pac 😎
Nate is on drugs
Hes already immortal . He cant lose . And lots of fighters can only envy him .
Chuck got me into watching the ufc but Nate made me fall in love with it
NateDiazArmy LFG!
NDA is a future competitor to UFC.
23:57 “n*gga” 😂
This guy is hilarious  Im the best fighter in the UFC besides my Brother hahaha.  Acting like he not getting paid  GTFOH. Im from the 209 and support Diaz, but Diaz never even held a belt in his 15 year career!  The one shot he had to move up. He pointed at Leon instead of taking him out to have been one step closer to the belt.
To us Nate is the ultimate warrior. The ufc is a machine that decides who is who for them.  Nate you're still a champion
this dude hasnt been able to complete a thought in years and no he hasnt always been this way go watch him in the ultimate fighter and nobody seems to care about his wellbeing when hes clearly got severe brain damage
Nate actually looks like a ball sack. Smart as one too.
6:00 what is he talking about? he probably had a joint before this.
Díaz Army
As I have commented on other related videos... the UFC is putting up fresh Fighters against old lions that are about to retire such as they did with cowboy Cerrone Anderson Silva I believe Luke rockhold is out the door and I now Nate Diaz
Nate Diaz is about to make a lot of people alot of money ...I'm not surprised motherf*cker's!!!!!! Nothing but respect Nate God bless it's been a great adventure watching the brothers fight I'm bless to be able to be apart of it as a fan 😜
I FEEL SORRY FOR NATE …..HÉ CAN EVEN SPEAK NORMAL
BEST INTERVIEW IVE SEEN IN YEARS. WOW! NATE IS SUCH A FING COOL DUDE! WHAT A REAL GUY! THE REAL DEAL!
He look so nervous. Like a man on death row!
“You shoulda worked on a computer somewhere ya nerd.” might just be my new favorite line from Nate
Nathan DIaz
CRAZY they are doing a legend like this. Absolutely insane. So much respect for Nate
Nate’s calling out the UFC for what they’ve done to the vets. Feeding big names to up and comers… Cerrone is another example. There are more.
Man I pray some how nate wins
Nate’s impressions of Gilbert and usman are spot on 😂
Lols Nate is a g 🤣 this has been a great Interview Brett I gotta go 😂
I never wanted to see this 2 fight its just a feeling
Did he just call Brett Okamoto Brad at the end? 😂
ESPN ever going to upgrade their cameras?
I love Nate however, he kills brain cells listening to him 🤣😂
The realest of the real. This fight is really about the  Diaz-brothers vs the UFC. I really want Nate to win this fight ( I'm from Sweden and a big fan of Khamzat too 🤷‍♂️😅). I'm certain that Chimaev will become champion one day but it will only take a little  bit longer. Edwards is probably doing the rematch against Usman so Chimaev will have to wait for a title shot anyway. War Diaz!
pay the man! 4:20
Anyone else worried about Nate’s mental state of mind?
He's a little dillusional.  Best fight here....what?????
Agree with the Goat 🐐 description of steroid use don’t have a chance.
This camera quality is unacceptably terrible. So annoying
Nate last of a dying breed
That Kamaru impression was on spot 😂😂
Every real UFC fan wants Diaz to win!!!
Talk to em Nate. Let em know 💯
This sounds more like a therapy session rather than an interview.
Love nate
Love you NATE!!!! YOU ARE THE BEST…YOU PAVE YOUR OWN ROAD!!!! RESPECT!!!!
oh man the UFC won't be the same without him.
u do steroids , and ill smoke weed. this guy is a legend for life. his interviews always gets better after hes warmed up. so glad we get to hear his thoughts about everything. wishing him nothing but the best regardless if hes leaving the ufc. nate is a real g
He sounds like he is about to cry
The real OG 💪
If your a Goat. Make a Goat.
720p is killlin me
love nate man jesus what a legenend ! hope he wins ! letss go nate!!!!
I hope Nate stops the train and locks in a triangle, two fingers in the air... What a way to walk...
Nate is way over his head on this he's washed up and out of shape (HAVE YOU SEEN HIS LAST FIGHT???) Just another money grab loss
Brett Okamoto did a great job with this interview
Let’s go Nate….💪🏻
Nate looks like he has brain trauma. After so long he has endured a lot. He sounds very incoherent!!!!
Real of the real
"Where you gonna be in 3 years? Knocked out and on your way out the door" Brutal line
I have never seen Nate scared like this before but I he survives .
This man is incredibly deluded, I always wondered why, then I looked at the comments and I know where he gets it from. He had 26 fights with the UFC and lost almost half of them. But he shits on people who have between 1-2 losses each and have held or currently hold belts. Something he could never do, he's deluded and his riders don't help, gonna get this guy killed.
I truly believe Nate just raised his stocks even more than before with this interview
Everyone needs to raise your hands and give your energy to Nate Diaz on Saturday
I hope he doesn't have brain damage. He sounds like Muhammad Ali
I like Brett but I wish it was Ariel
Ppl in the comments are more emotional and delusional than Nate LOL HILARIOUS
Team Diaz! 💯
Let's go Nate u got this. Mexican-American/Chicano pride in this muthafucka!!!
Love this guy, common Nate fk this Khamzat guy up. If the UFC had 6 rounds Nate would be number 1 for years
Nate & Nick are the GOAT🥊
That was cool
I’m a huge Diaz fan.. but I’ll be honest, he seems a little nervous in this fight against Khamzat… two reasons why: Khamzat hits hard and wrestled extremely well, two things that’ll effect nate… Why am I saying this? Nate mentioned multiple times from 16:00-17:00 that “if he loses”… saying that statement multiple times isn’t a good sign. I could be over reading this but nate said it a lot … got a feeling he’s going into this with a poor mindset. Feel for him 😢
Brad sitting there leg on leg like a hoe Infront of gangsta. Show some respect, Brad. Or go modeling. 🤮
Nothing but love nate , good luck to you , and I hope you win , I'll be rooting for you
Nate should put some respect on Charles name, du bronx would own him
Kamara Usman Cleaned the whole division up what is he talking about
Lmaoooo that Usman impression
You can tell he's emotional. In some other world he probably wishes he was the poster boy and the cash cow or maybe that he could've had more from the company. Then he realizes he's nate and he's not trying to be someone he's not. He's all ready in the hall of fame in most people's eyes. A good man a warrior through and through its been a pleasure watching you fight. Especially choking out that coked up excuse for a fighter. Win lose or draw I'll always be proud of the fact that he smoked conor and never promoted the company. I hope these guys go in to the ring and protest. Dana we get you're a businessman but this guy is bigger than the sport. I hope nate moves onto bigger and better things.
You can't be a Diaz hater after listening to him expose the UFC Machine in this interview. The Diaz brothers will always be Respected in the MMA game. Even the haters know that 💯.
sounds a little like Mike Tyson.
Nate is a walking punching bag. Dude you should just retire. The CTE is already affecting your speech.
Nates def more wound up than usual
Nate, I know what you’re sayin
im gonna miss this dude  :'(  what a long and great career he had 2007 - 2022
IVE SAID FOR YEARS THAT NATE HAS MORE HEART THAN ANY OTHER FIGHTER 💯
Brett seems to be getting better. He must be on that Paulo Costa zecret joose.
My money is on Nate
Stuck in an era that's the problem with the Diaz bros,  You can deny it all you want Leon played with you like you were an amateur. You have to show respect and respect the potential and devellopement of the new upcomers. We ll see how its gonna go with Chimaev
God let nate win
"You do steroids and I'll smoke weed and we can get in there and scwabb." Nate Diaz 😎
Nate is the Realest Mofo I've ever seen
Nate is not the best he’s acting soft!! He ain’t no gangster
I feel so bad for me they literally hate Nick his brother so much that they're taking out all the b******* on me Nate should have been the face of the UFC years ago because he was a form system bread minor leagues type of ultimate fighter person coming up through the ranks they should have hopped on that and promoted the s*** out of them they have definitely mishandled and mistreated Nate Diaz throughout his entire career shame on Dana and the UFC for doing so
Nate wins this nomatter what happens, he rides off into the sunset with a plethora of multi multi million dollar fights on his table, he won the game
This is a perfect example of what marijuana does long term
What does mushmouth mean? ( Sorry, I'm not a native speaker)
He’s so dint
The game is moving forward with or without Nate and UFC will use all the juice from him before u go exist
King Diaz👑
Win lose or draw Nate Diaz is and always will be the baddest mf in the ufc not afraid of any soul! And ain’t afraid to tell us when Dana is bullshitting🎯💯
Khamzat help nathan retired.
Thank god for Nate Diaz
Best quote ever “I refuse to be lame”
I really want Diaz to Win! WAR DIAZ 😎👍
Thanks for the best generation ever of fights👊 Nobody’s been more fun than Nick, Nate to watch. No bigger wars have been had. Yes many the same or equal. No one has fought as many names as Nate
REFUSE TO BE LAME!
Brett seems like Nate's counselor here lmaoo
when a fighter goes against the company. The company tends to win all the time. Nate Diaz is still that man win or lose this will be interesting even tho this fight makes no sense
I dont think Nate realises everyone wants him to win i even think the ufc would sac chimiaev for that
This isn't a matchup it's a money fight and promotion for Khamzat. Diaz deserves better. Nate isn't the UFC's poster boy but they know he's a fan favourite.
this first 7 minutes of the interview feels like im watching someone who was just in a horrific car crash be asked to name all 50 States of America. Nate got that Tyson brain, you can't even be sure if he's got a serious case of CTE or is just high because he smokes all the time.
Great fighter but he’s about as dumb as a democrat.
Nick was always my favorite fighter. Love the Diaz boys.
Hope he wins he deserves it
17:13 Brett got shook lol
I like nate and I'm gonna miss him, but he is so delusional.
he sounds like he already lost this fight he's out of breath just talking
"It's Kill or be Killed" and that's the difference between a Wolf and a Lion. Lets go big Nate  You got this!!
Diaz. Army.
Let’s go nate
This was a great interview, I gotta go. Lol. Gonna miss Nates endless sound bites.
Nate needs to remember what edwards done to him before that 5 th round punch 😂😂 I feel sorry for him though man UFC have done him dirty here
Pay that man what he deserves, Contract Or Not, Arbitration should be a crime by shorting this man out of his work effort and labor and money
Best ufc interview of all time
Freaking love Nate NEVER WILL BE ANOTHER ONE LIKE HIM ….WISH HE WOULD HAVE SLAPPED BRETT FOR SUCKING UP TO KHAMZAT
That's what's up mf's real champion fighter
Brett did good here. Let Nate go when he gets going.
Nate winning would shake up the UFC world
what a bozo
I like nate but he's always making excuses
Man that's tough he's getting older his time fighting in ufc almost over man I think if he goes forreal forreal not gangster I'm talking Gracie nate with the hands I would absolutely love that God bless nate I know you got this
Rooting for Nate from 805 SoCal
Poor Diaz , he gonna have a new look after the first 30 seconds , I don’t see this match going beyond a minute or minute and half.
Nate vs Dana White. I will buy that 😎
If Jon Jones is the GOAT then so is Lance Armstrong.
This is the most real I have ever seen Nate. When he talked about Kamaru saying he'd think about fighting Isarel if the money was right - that hit me. I agree with him.
209 👊
God please let Nate choke dude out if anyone deserves this is Nathan
Gotta give it to Okamotto on this one, what a great interview!!!!!!
Lets Go Diaz
Slowly sounding more and more like Mike Tyson 😂😂
What a legend…. Nate is what the UFC should be. Just hope he doesn’t get hurt… so many last fights……
"Adam sandler" Nate knows what's up 🤣 legend man
I kind of was rooting for Khamzat. But after this interview, I definitely am for Nate!
NATE DIAZ IS THE GOAT
Nate "Anywhere , anyone , anytime" Diaz .
He not start yet and he is already bleeding from the left eye
Poor Nate, guy just wants to express his feelings but acts like he doesn’t 😂
The most gangster thing that could happen is Nate’s corner throwing in the Towel after 1 Stockton slap 👋 This is attempted clout theft 🤦🏻‍♂️
I don’t like this interviewer 🫠
Has there been any rumors that he choked on a chicken bone when he was young or them iq points were beat outta him in the streets?
Nate wins this fight and goes to beat edwards for the belt lets go nate
Prob the best Nate interview ever norm seems like don't want to be there aye but he letting it fly today
His circle has no champions.
This 1 for the books🥋 📚 🙇‍♂️
I respect Nate the most (win or lose). He’s a legend,, unmatched
Diaz army all the way to the end ! Nick and Nate are the 🐐 🐐
Awesome man Nate Diaz! Going to war. Same ole same ole. Said it like a pro.
Bro just want his respect. Straight up, he deserve it. Especially from the company.
Welcome Dubai 😭😭 Nate is so precious ❤️
I’m a simple man…  At work on a 15 minute break, watching a 30 minute interview with Nate Diaz (w ads) I click  My replacement can wait 15 extra minutes.
I need that Weed Nate smoking ! True Legend !
Nate is a true OG, love the Diaz Bros!!! Nate is a true warrior 💯💯✊🏾✊🏾💪🏾💪🏾!!
He reminds me of mike Tyson, he different kind of human
we LOVE YOU Nate 💪💙👑🙌💯
Brain damage and weed abuse. "Oh weeds good for you because roe jogan"
really love this guy, just don't like when he starts talking much.. why does UFC do this everytime to the diaz brothers..
Nate Diaz is "Shocking the 🌏" This weekend👊💯
Nate is definitely the GOAT with interviews, and this was one of his best ever. Gonna miss the real OG if he ends up leaving.
“I don’t want to be lame “ - Nate Diaz ….
You watching nate's Testament  Goodbye nate
This is how you interview Diaz brothers,let them talk, and if you know mma you know exactly what Nate means !
I know Diaz can win , if he wants to. But I fear he’s going to throw the fight so he can get out of the contract.
I WISH I HAD NATE DIAZ HEART. Solid dude. Warrior to the core.
A Nor Cal Legend! Nick Diaz Army MF!
F*ck Dana and the UFC for doing this to Nate
Not one bad comment, what a fan base this guy has got! Hope he wins, when he cliped leon i though i was gunna have an heart attack. Cmon Nate dog!
When this guys turn 50 we will not understand anything they are saying.  Too many hits in the head.
Nate don't forget win lose or draw it's a win win for u my dude....u already made and taken ur respect the fans know who the real gangster of the UFC will always be bro ur set in stone it can't be taken from u
Should Nate lose, I hope he takes the minimal amount of damage possible. Tall order to ask😔
champ of the whole ufc?
1.25x ... you'll thank me after
16:29 I thought Nate was gone cry 😢 Tough to see my boy going out like this. 💯
look like he tweaknnn😆
💯
We have your back brotha, get that knockout for us! 💪🏼
Diaz is one of the best things to ever happen to this company and they wouldn't give him Ferguson for his way out. So slimy.
I would pay a kings Ransom to watch nate Diaz and Mike tyson have a debate..
Nate is high 🤣🤣😮‍💨real king 💪🏿
The whole organization!  Nate for president
The older nate gets the more he looks like Nick. It's so crazy!! Love the Diaz bros!! Let's go Nate!!!
Legit man Nate knows what's up I don't think I've wanted a upset more than anything ever
Just kick nates legs. Game over
Nate by submission
"You do steriods and I'll smoke weed"
#.Realest of the Real ...!!! 🔥🔥🔥 Only love and respect for Nate diaz .
Nate ,you and your brother have nothing to prove. You both have provided the fans with extraordinary fights. You need to look after for yourself.  You guys are some of the best, fearless, never give up guys. Much respect  and continued  support
Tony vs Nate should’ve been the fight.
Nate’s been punched in the head too many times. Dude can’t even finish a sentence
Should have been Ariel there Okomato asks the most stupid questions
Bro why is volume wack
Nate smh. Khamzet already made bro. But I get it!! You better win bro! You will help his case the loudest tho
IM NOT SUPRISED MF
Its sad knowing he doesnt and didnt want this fight but hes gonna give it his all and he feels pressured. Im a fan of Khamzat but i wouldnt mind seeing him lose.
Conor need to come out of his ufc contract and make Diaz vs Conor 3 .. both of them promote the fight and make it the biggest fight in sport combat history plus biggest payday for both guys with out the ufc brass . What u guys think ?
Real Fighting Inc.
I can guarantee you this.  Win or lose, Dana and the UFC brass are afraid of what Nate is gonna say once he is "free" and has a mic in his face with nothing to lose.  I'm hoping it is after derailing another hype machine and walking away on his terms.
I'm absolutely rooting for my homie. Diaz gonna give him a fight,win or lose he'll have the respect of the real MMA fans. He never loses,well you know what I mean
"...if you're Mr. goat then make a goat" 💀
one of the goats 🐐 hands down
That's why we love Nate Diaz, that's gangster, that's Stockton
Bro someone help this guy !
Censoring Nate Diaz is a crime in it of itself.
Nate wanted to fight Francis too 🤦🏾‍♂️
Poor Nate feel bad for him what is coming is not going to be easy
Come on nate
Nate really just be talking to hisself like it’s nothing 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love this guy. Straight up G💯 Booo!!😳💭What!! Smack! Lol.
War Diaz 👊😎👊
Nick and Nate both have serious social anxiety and their minds race when asked questions. They know what the want to say, but struggle to say it. This does not mean they are unintelligent. They have a lot of anger and resentment which is what makes them loyal friends. I truly enjoy watching them both.
I'm a fan of Nate but win, lose or draw this should be his last fight. He is so punch drunk. He is talking about making khamzat....khamzat is a dog in my opinion for even taking the fight. Nate hasn't won in years
You can see how disgusted he is about the the disrespect that the ufc has done to him over the years. I hope Nate wins and gives another I'm not surprise muthafuccka interview.
Nate you lost to Leon. Dominated you every round except 2 minutes of the last round!
I would love Nate to win this fight !!
9:49 usman impression lol
F**k Dana white, “this is the fight the fans are calling for” no it’s not numb nuts
Go on Nate 💪 take it to  "em all" the bosses  they are all people who doubt you unless,,3 they behind ,
Sooooo everyone just gonna ignore the fact he said the N word twice. If this was any other white fighter on the roster people would be freaking out. 😂 gotta love it.
"If your a goat then make a goat 🐐". . . Nate reflecting on his bro making him. 💯💯
Diaz Army MF'S!!! 💪
Nate is hight as fook hahahah
“I refuse to be lame” Nate Diaz
I have to say for once Nate talked a lot of sense
He is next level thick
Nate is top 10 ever to do it. Win or lose the guy will fight anyone
Half hour nate diaz yea get the kettle on babes 2 sugars
He's been loosing lately still down with the Diaz brothers aka the smash bros
Best Nate interview ever
This man has accepted his fate lol
I love Nate and I'm a huge fan but to be honest he doesn't sound all the way right like he dont sound clear headed, not sure what's going on with him but looking forward to seeing him do what he does best in the octagon
He has them 🍄🍄 vibes for sure
I really like khamzat but despite all the love I have for him I want Nate to win! When nate speaks I feel him, what a cool bro!
I love nate man. I would like to see him retire with honour. UFC doing a nasty move with him.
The fact that this might actually be his last fight is beautiful and ugly at the same time
If you’re a goat make a goat!
na nate bro you got this
Nate !, you will always be # 1
One of the greatest to ever do it
Nates a DAWG
always been one of my favorites
War diaz!! 209
Nate can’t beat Usman. Usman making records Nate just selling tickets
I doubt we will see a face off
12:40
Nick Diaz army. Nate Diaz revolution, mother fuckers.
Let's go Nate want you to win brother so bad and glad ya gave Josh Thomson he's props
Diaz is such an OG. I really hope he wins . If Nate can get it past 2 round that will give him a better chance for sure . On paper it’s a bad match up Nate , he doesn’t do well with wrestlers . I do think khamzat will be able to take him down easily he’s much bigger
Love this dude
We need that press conference
The ufc needs to Just let this guy retire and hang his hof banner up. No more getting punched after this. Go chill and enjoy the fresh air. 10million retirement bonus. Love him or hate him he was perfect for connor & that rivalry made ufc what it is. 🐐
This fight pisses me off. Dana just couldn’t allow him to go without attempting to snatch one last thing out his pocket. I won’t be buying this fight, Nate’s not getting any PPV points, and so why? I’ve been a fan of this Guy for almost 20 years. I’m with him, he’s fighting to get out of a contract, and 🤦🏻‍♂️
It’s 2022 someone needs to tell ESPN about 1080p and 1440…BT Sport knows 🇬🇧
That was a great interview... the interviewer is supposed to listen... great 👍 job
If that isn't your favorite fighter, you don't know fighting 🤘
Brett gave him the stage .. good job Brett
Please get Brett a better camera..
Y’all got Mk ultra on diaz. The rhetoric the propaganda of WAR, of a Muslim “assassin” killing the Mexican American. This is weird. Again, this is SPORT ladies and gentlemen. Not race war.
Nates my favorite OG fighter and Khamzat is my favorite new generation fighter. Old vs New
Please please please submit Chimaev
Lmfao I love Nate . First half this interview him just rambling on . Khamzat has lost some of my respect this week, picking a fight with Paulo costa who has a broken hand who was with 2 guys , khamzat was with his entire team 10-15 guys . I honestly think if Diaz can get this fight past two rounds he can win . Especially if khamzat fights like he did against burns he was gassed out after that fight 3 rounds and he was honestly super tired after 2 round . I do think he will fight smarter but who knows
I'm putting my money on Nate. For those doing the same if he loses then we will all lose together 💯
God I hope nate knocks him out and gets the BELT AFTER
Incredible!
Was hoping for a version for adults, but even a censored Diaz interview is always a treat. Nate: "You know what I'm sayin'?" Brett: "Mm Hmm." Narrator: "In fact, Brett had absolutely no idea what Nate was saying". They will be missed 33:19
Nate is hysterical. He like I have to go I'm out
The most open, honest and real dude in the mma. I respect his warrior spirit and fearlessness and I hope that he dismantles khamzat
Love Nate!! When he is done- bam- I gotta go!!
Love the ufc product but they don’t paint themselves well. Nate should be fighting tony this weekend, not khamzat. Really leaves me with a sour taste that they’ve done Nate like this.
At 4:18 The interviewer asks Nate if anything is different, then he notices how Nate starts opening up about how he’s gonna feel pressure from the organization fans haters. Then the interviewer notices that hes opening up that’s why he asked the same question again but in a different way expecting a reaction outta him but nate gives him the same answer that will be at 4:34. Thats why nate is a real one!
How ripped is he 😂😂😂😂😂
ESPN with that top tier audio & video quality 👌
Geniuses are always strange people
Take a shot every time Nate sits up or leans back
I hope Nate leaves the UFC for good and goes on to fight Jake Paul and make a minimum of 10mil.   Then fight Conor under McGregor sports and entertainment under their own co-promoted companies outside the UFC.
Much respect to Okamoto, he is an excellent interviewer, giving space to Nate
“I refuse to be lame” what a legendary quote let’s go Nate
Sleep
Did Nate just say the UFC is rigged? @ 26:29
Why do interviewers think they have anytype of status??? It's beyond me
Nate Diaz’s retirement is going make me tear up. 😢  One of the G.O.A.Ts of MMA!
Just straight Diaz!. Gunna miss this dude!
I want to see nate getting paid the matchup is digusting but i'm still rooting for him
this heat in Nate will make him destroy khamzat
Brett Okomoto is one of the worst things to happen to MMA.
You could cut this up and make him sound crazy but he actually said a lot and it all added up
I’d love to see a satire of this interview
i think it’s so funny that he’s just calling out Usman literally the whole interview 😆😂😭 he’s got some major beef with Kamaru huh?
really want nate to win this one 🙏🏼this man is a legend with a true warriors heart.
One thing for sure ,this ain't gonna be  boring !
"You do steroids, I'll smoke weed", absolute classic Diaz quote. This is a goldmine, best I've seen from him.
I can't help but feel bad for Nate. He's so warped he doesn't know which way is up.
Poor Diaz has had massive brain injuries, he can hardly even talk, hopefully he has a good wife to look after him
The best outcome will be he submits Chimaev with the same choke he won the ultimate fighter and give everyone the finger.  One can only hope.
im with nate.. 🖕 the machine
1:40 The man is right. Was UFC 141 when Nate defeated Cerrone and the main event was Lesnar vs Overeem.
It’s a beautiful thing when a quiet man who is interesting opens up I’ll probably watch this a few times.
Nate sounds like Chris from Family Guy! :D
This interview was very sketch and awkward.  Constantly getting punched and kicked while smoking weed 10x as much as that Is just a horrific mix.  Wish him the best..
I love Nate and will always support this dude. But I’m sorry I just don’t see this going well. He’s 37 and he’s been in soooo many wars. There’s a slim possibly that Khamzat gasses but even then I can’t see W for Nate. Sad. They literally threw him to the wolf.
Honestly I hope they have a great fight, it would be amazing to see a fight out of Diaz and Khamzat, like the burns Khamzat fight. Fuk him up Nate!!!
The realest 💯
Nate LFG!!!
Nate’s the man hands down real gangster
Hope this punch drunk clown gets knocked out and retired for good.
The way Bret said good luck at the end was telling. He knows UFC are trying to screw Nate and he would love nothing more to see Nate pull off what would easily be 1 of the biggest upsets in combat sports history
Want Nate to win so bad. He's ready to be done with the UFC. To see him put out Khamzat and just peace out is the perfect ending to the DIAZ ARMY against the UFC
So many fans talk about the P4p and GOAT thing like it’s a legit ranking order, you could name people the GOAT based on their careers and resumes after retired but surely not as they are active after a few defended in a ranking that’s forever fluctuating
looks like nate is a in a really dark place, hope he gets some help with whatever what haunts him
I have to admit, I’ve always had a love/hate relationship with Diaz. I can’t stand the fanbase nor the pretending that he wins every fight that loses. However, this dude has fought so many killers and is rarely given an easy fight. Guys like Masvidal and Diaz deserve respect in the ring because they aren’t getting the stat-padding opponents. They take a lot of L’s but so would just about everyone else with the opponents they face.
Nate ur a ducking warrior full stop End of  A Buckin legend  Hope you slaughter this cnut   Much love from Ireland   We don't all love that dwarf  Jackeen cnut  Much love bruv 🇮🇪✊😁😉👍💚
Nate is fighting Khamzat, who is big enough to fight Izzy, who lost to Jan who lost to Glover, who lost to Rumble Johnson, who lost to DC, who lost to Stipe, who lost to Francis.... Nate is the UFCs ultimate champ.
one of the greatest interview of nate thx for that
Nates impression of Usman, was actually pretty good lmaoo
If Nate somehow beats Khamzat he would shatter the internet.
Love Nate Diaz!!!!!!!!
Yo I gotta say, it’s honestly kinda heart-breaking listening to Nate. When you think about how hard he’s worked and everything he’s accomplished, for the UFC to turn around and stick him with this as his final fight to try burying him is straight up spitting in his face. As tough as Nate is, that shits gotta hurt.
Nate is the ‘Rebel ‘ of the company but  loved 🥰 by many. I hope the result will be a fairytale  for all of us Diaz fans this coming sat !
If Nate smokes Khamzat it will be the biggest moment in the sport since McGregor smoked Jose Aldo in December 2015.  Reality will change overnight. Suddenly the over-age Anderson Silva will be favoured to KO Jake Paul. Perceptions would change within a second.
Brett Okamoto is the worst
Maaan Nate you refuse to be lame but all your last fights are lame you could've knocked out Leon but didn't pressure
Nate seems nervous ufc done him dirty
I know he's not a mental wizard... But this is the sharpest and most articulate i've seen Nate Diaz.  He's dialed in I think!  This is going to be real interesting.  Maybe he is on some Alpha Brain! haha
The UFC is like every other fraudulent company that will get what’s coming to them! Nate Diaz army all the way!
Getting hit to many times does jeopardize brain cells !
Brett Okamoto is like a therapist in this one.
Bro got me into ufc for real he the PEOPLE CHAMPION
Let's Go Nathan!!!
Nate will fight the fight of his life
MMA gods, make Nate the new Leon Edwards, or a triangle choke like Silva vs Chael.
23:34 Jon Jones? Nate:Who?? Looooool best line
I like how Brett is letting Nate just GO. Not interrupting and not trying to fit what he had planned for the interview. Raw and uncut.
Weird seeing Nate this way. He sounds a lot more sad and dissapointed rather than angry about how UFC has treated him.
He's not wrong.
why is there no 1080p
24:06 lolllllllllllllllllll
Love this guy, Nate is always in the fight and in my opinion he is the Goat. Look at his career over the years he has given us many wars. Can’t wait to see where he goes next. I will follow where ever he goes. The Army with this man.
Bruh nick and Nate can’t ever verbally express what they’re feeling cause they don’t have the vocabulary. They are barely literate, you can see they have something to say but can’t articulate it properly. Painful to watch honestly.
DIAZ 100
nate literally talked at him for 30 minutes then said "this has been a great interview i gotta go" lol
Seemed emotional, fascinating guy
"If you're the goat, make a goat..." -nate
His kinda right u can’t be the Goat if you got caught using…
praying for you nate, god is with you and shines through you, remember that in the octagon saturday.
Nate Diaz he doesn't like toking to mach. Hi is cool guy 😎 but Hi fill lazy toking  .
Dude's delusional asf.
I'm rooting for nate........
He finally acknowledged the Thompson fight … he KOd and nobody ever says it …
Nate Diaz is making it impossible for leon/ kamaru ( whoever wins the rematch) to not fight Khamzat next.
I predict a replay of the triangle choke with 2 middle fingers in the air!!!
he have much stuff inside that he need to let out!
Nate wanted this fight, he literally asked the UFC for this fight.    One of the greats, he might not have the prettiest records, but he's got the biggest heart.   Seems like he's been the underdog his whole career.  Would love to see him win.
Nate Diaz fans are wishing Drake bets big on Khamzat while Chael Sonnen predicting him to win
This is my boy! He's my goat, he's my champ.
sounds like a crackhead
Nate is the truth 😤. A whole new level of appreciation towards Nate now, he is the best, win or lose 👊👊👊👊
War Diaz
Long live Nate!
Chito Vera is a amazing fighter
He looks more and more like nick every day.
22:40🤣🤣😂😂😂😭😭😭😘
I always cheer for khamzat, but I want Nate to win this one just because of how dirty they have done him with this match up
Say that you will about his skills of articulation, or lack thereof, this dude actually spoke a lot of cold hard wisdom in this interview. Make no mistake.
Nate “you know I’m sayin” Diaz 😂
Legend Nate Diaz!!
Love Nate he’s the true OG !
The love for his brother is unconditional
Interviewer: ………
How can u mot respect him? He is the realest,  he ain't just about the show , he is about the fight.
Khamzats previous opponents used to succumb and bend down to his physicality and dominance... but that wont work on Nate.... Nate by round 4/5 tko
Nate as real as they come.
Nate is a G but he's not making a lot of sense in this interview which is consistent with all his other interviews
Hope he got through his career without severe head trauma; I doubt it tho
Hold on let me put my pants on😂😂😂😂😂 dude the guy is hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂🫡🫡🫡🔥🔥😎😎😎
i dont know why but i love this guy
Choose sides! Im not gonna be a surprised motherfucker 😏  LETS GO DIAZ 209!
I pray Diaz can sleep khamzat it have to be by elbow or sub 🙏
I swear! If you get high it ALL makes sense! 😂💨
You should have worked on the computer somewhere you nerd 😆😆😆
9:50 nates usman impression 😂😂😂
Diaz has clearly got brain damage
To  Nate Diaz: I will always name you in the Goat conversation. From Pawtucket, Rhode Island to Fort Myers, FL.  Me and my homies love you dog.
“If you think your the GOAT then make a GOAT” Nate gone rock this mf
Everyone i talk to thinks i'm crazy for believing Nate is going to win but i do genuinely feel is going to win, i have no doubts about that
Despite being an amazing fighter, you can see the impact of all those years in the way that he slurs his speech and keeps forgetting words and names and dates. Half of what he said made absolutely no sense at all.
Diaz 🐐 's
Idk what he is saying half the time but, I love it. Hope he wins.
Surprise again muthafuckers!  Come on Nate 🙏🏻
Best of the best. Diaz=Real
This interview made me really like Nate
My first card was McGregor v Diaz and since then I've watched nothing but old UFC and new UFC 🙏 I pray one of my idols gets it done this Saturday but I'm no casual fan and I know who and what khamhat is that's why it kinda makes me mad that UFC would do a legend like this on his last fight either way I'm rootting for Diaz as usual 💯
720p? Really ESPN?
No time stamps? Come on
Love how real nate is
Nate Diaz is a legend
I like Nate, but he's going into that fight losing already.  you can see it already.
He has CTE
Really beautiful interview. I'm super upset the UFC would do Nate like this. No other sport would do their legends like this. I'm a Khamzat fan but I hope Nate wins🙏🛸🌚
Seems like his mind is racing... still behind him tho
I wish he wins so much… decision or sub… I need Nate to win
Just lost brain cells
Nate look like thumb wars
Just me or is he the biggest drama queen in the UFC
Every year all the different MMA leagues should fight each other. Then put a world championship title that the best of all different fighting promotions fight for.
You fought Burns Dog
This interviewed should have stopped at min 19. Everything after that Nate does not good for Nate …😬
Where is the full video??
You scared bro Just admit
Yall gotta quit bleeping out nate bruh. Everyone else fine. But not nate.
We all love nate 💪💪
Nate definitely belong hall of frame
When he wins and ya didn’t put money down… Plus, when ufc gotta figure out what’s next….Heweeey
Lets go Nate
For such a large channel/company, you guys have such bad quality videos..  We need 1080 at least
He looks and sounds so much like nick in this interview
It’s hard to see the ufc & Dana effecting my mans emotions. Hes been fighting top 10 contenders his whole pro career & not getting the appreciation from his company
“Nick made me If your mr goat make a goat then” that was cold🥶
How to have a good Diaz interview. #1 don’t ask questions
The one thing you can never say about Nate is he never speaks his mind and will always be 100 with you. The dude is a real badass. Through in and through out.
The asterisks* for steroids Are being applied like an Eastern European weightlifting record. He’s got majorly good arguments. I get it now. Im a better fan after this
Who doesn't want Nate Diaz to win this fight? I hope Nate finishes him. 👊
Pfff
Can you upload an uncensored clip for us Europeans who aren't children? Messes up the flow with these cuts.
Nate got a little DeNiro going on. You talkin ta me....
What a fckin legend -   Since he last fought I’ve not been interested in the ufc -   When he leaves the UFC i leave-  Sounding more and more like Mike Tyson these days 😂
He is right about steroid Jones! I don't see how people dont understand what Nate said. Steroids Jones is out of the question you do steroids your out of the conversation your disqualified! He a cheater!
The questions are stupid and it's stupid for Nate to sit down and answer them.
Nate should tap as soon as bell rings that would be the biggest F.U to Dana
The hardest line ever said by a fighter period "You do steroids, I smoke weed I dont care lets get in there and squab" -Nathan Diaz
For the next 15 years 💀
Is there an unedited version?
Best interview ever!🔥 Nate is the GOAT!
amazing interview. Come on NATE!
Everyone I ever said would beat Nate he always pulls it’s out in the end are just straight blasting them none stop till the end let’s go Nate
Nate 4 Hall Of Fame
If you multiply age with amount of fights you get, Nate: 37*34= 1258; Khamzat: 28*11= 308. Nate has four times more milage on the clock than Khamzat. Not a fair fight - fans should boycott this fight to get the UFC to match fighters with fair opponents. This will be another Costa vs Rockhold, Vera vs Cruz, Cerrone vs Mcgregor, Lawler. S Barberrena. All bull sh!t man
9:51 snoozeman 🤣
Nick Diaz is a legend
Huge Diaz fan. Him and Jones where the reason why I start watching UFC. ❤️ Shame he gotta fight the wolf now.. it's super unfair!
He throws in al pacino, Robert deniro and Adam sandler all in the Same category
Did you guys listen, Nate said it if you are on steroids you are out of the GOAT list no question. But for nate everybody it's on steroids lol
The interview the worlds been waiting for!!!!
they should of gave nate the mcgregor fight like this era of mma is ending and putting someone who has gone through it all against a hungry contender whos career is just starting is so screwed up because who knows how many fights Nate got left or McGregor they should of had one last hurrah because we all know it would be a entertaining fight plus its a good send off to the 2 fighters who brought so many too mma giving nate to khamzat is just sad
Nate got some mad ptsd from all the wars he’s been in. Respect to Nate.
i admire Nates delude loyalty to his boys
Nate as a white girl 32:19 lmao
Boy got a good point on the whole ranking system. And, his place in it. But, it is what is. Can’t be no other way. But, if you don’t put a few bucks on Nate’s spread for this event but watched this whole thing, than you missing the whole point.
Diaz bros had chances to beat the top guys they just didn’t get it done. It is definitely about wins and losses to be determined GOATs.
Did Nate say he beat Leon lol he said he’s best fighter ever lol
Chimaev v Burns was brought to you by Real Fight, Inc.
Nate was dead on point about the “steroid champions.”
Huge commercial mega sports channel yet still has super quiet audio and 720p? Geez, hire some people ESPN.
since when did nate become Robert De Niro?
You do steroids and I'll smoke weed and we'll get in there and fight 😆
I refuse to be lame 👊🏾💪🏾🐐
brain damage is troubling in this guy
Diaz brothers on UFC
Nate just canceled John Jones.  Awesoms
I agree on the Anderson Silva and Jon jones take, way too much doping to be considered a goat next to someone like DJ
he actually convinced me that he is a champion
Nate wins via Heel Hook
As much as I love nate I would like to see him retire walk off into the sunset he has coped a lot of punishment over the years
Let's give Nate a new title... He is a L.O.A.T LEgend of all time  Pretty sad that they just use Nate to build other fighters careers... I hope he has a great fight but you can tell he is ready to checkout of the UFC
The greatest fighter to ever step into the UFC octagon.
Never seen a Diaz interview like this
He looks pretty close to tears. I'm sure it's not just this fight that has them this way. What people don't seem to realize is when these Fighters get older and they know in their hearts that they're not the same fighter that they once were before it starts to affect them mentally. You can see it in their speech or Nick's and Nate's cases CTE but either way they're just not that into it. And for good reason. I bet you it's a lot of fun and games when you're young and you have the ability. But when you start getting older and you start losing fight after fight and your head's getting pounded in and you're having a hard time talking yeah I imagine that the lead up is not as exciting as at once was you kind of just want to get in there get it over with get paid and get the f*** out. If I'm to choose somebody to win this fight, it's obviously not Nate but it doesn't mean that I hate Nate like all of his fans think you do if you choose against him. You just have to take reality has a deciding factor mix that in don't make it about who your favorite fighter is cuz they're not just going to win because you like them more. The only thing they have going for him in this fight is this gas tank. He has as much or more stamina than any UFC fighter that I've ever seen winner or loser. That and that alone gives him a shot in this fight but everything else leads towards him losing even his demeanor. Good luck to your quote unquote Army of fans and hopefully they don't hate Khamzat for the rest of his career just because he laid out a legend.
Nate needs to layoff that crack pipe
can someone repost this with subtitles translation. not just direct subtitles but an actual translation.  its like hes speaking chinese
Nate will finish him round 3.
You do steroids I'll smoke weed and we'll go in there and scrap 😎😂😂😂😂😂 I swear gotta love Nate 💯💪❤️😂
The true gladiator nowadays ✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻 Make some noise for the real face of the fight game !!!
Thanks for recording this on a potato
😂 bet you never thought you'd head Nate Diaz say  "Creme de la creame"
Nick and Nate Diaz are both 2 of the best fighters to ever fight in the UFC, or any other organisation.
Khamzat is my favorite current fighter but I love Nate. I'm torn. Of course I want to see Khamzat keep on the climb he's on, but man if Nate pulls this off I'll be so happy for him. More than anything I love the SPORT, so I'll be watching on the edge of my seat. May the best man win, good luck to both!!
That ending tho...🤣🤣🤣🤣 What a Legend!
1 word....WARRIOR!
Did Nate not hear Brett disrespect Nick a while ago ? I would of smacked that fool
Great interview. Okamoto isn't a d bag like the rest of the ufc commentators. Bisping is ok., ...so he gets genuine answers from fighters.
9:48 that's deep. never looked at it that way
I would love for Nate to win but I don’t believe he will. I just hope he doesn’t get crushed. Nick and Nate and brought a lot to the UFC and fans over the years!
Amidst Nates confused ramblings he's outling how it's bs that he, an established UFC legend is being massively and unfairly disrespected by Dana who's basically feeding him to the lions like some washed up nobody... and he's correct in what he says and to feel that way.  At this stage of his career he deserves better than that.
Nate is a badass...
Нейт Диаз уважает старую школу. Нейт воин, удачи ему! Nathan Diaz respects the old school. Nathan is a warrior, good luck to him!
Nick Diaz and Nate Diaz are the best fighter in history
Nate still is a legend
I hope Nate drops this clown an then resigns a crazy deal cause he deserves it
This is what brain damage and lots of partying sounds like 😂
If your a goat then make a goat🤣
Nate and Mike Tyson should start a podcast together
A lot of what he said can only make sense to him and his closest fans.  I would love to see him do well because he has always manned up.  But I think even he know that this will be a tough go.
“I refuse to be lame”
Well said about roids...
Honestly  If nate diaz wasn't as hard as he is I would say he was almost in tears multiple times in this interview.......he's so hurt.  We love you diaz.       PROVE THE WORLD WRONG
Mad respect for Nate for even accepting this fight after not being in the octagon for so long.
We’ll never see another bj penn he was amazing when he fought Sean Sherk
We are going to see a Nate on fire with a mission. He would love nothing more to beat khamzat and embarrass Dana and give the finger as he is walking out. Nate is coming for khamzats head lol
I refused to be lame lmao
He's brain damaged
nates done..... he is as real as it gets but he aint hungry nomore
How can you not love Nate
Khamzat is fake fr
No one in the ufc is as delusional as nate diaz.
Bit deluded like
Nate Diaz to Usman "If you want to be the goat you've got to create a goat like my brother" Meanwhile, Kamaru Usman's brother stomping through his division.  Awkward silence.
I love Khamzat - but f*ck it - kill em Nate.
Nete diaz gonna get eat by the wolf 🥲
The realest
19:53 nates last fight would've been so good vs Chandler or Poirier
lol brett just asking about nate’s feelings
My guy  🙌👊🏻
Anyone getting Mike Tyson vibes?
Please protect Nate at all costs. What a guy.
I love Nate but just my personal opinion I do wish he would smoking dope. If it helps him feel better then that’s great I just don’t want it to damage his mental health
ESPN like this is YouTube and we are watching MMA….. we don’t need this censored
Win or lose Nate is a legend!
Just tell him not to fight like a WOMEN and tell him to fight like a man REMEMBER this BOI🤜🤛 KICK all this girls fight from UFC🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿
This whole interview sounds like a 33 minute long GTA intro scene
As far i am concern  ,  I was the champion the whole Time.  - Nate Diaz
Truth is...Nate has already won...win or no win on this deal.  Love this guy.
The mf peoples champ !
Best interview I’ve ever seen by a fighter. Nate is the realest
I can’t imagine trying to be yourself in a world that’s trying to make you like everybody else. There’s something to say about this man which does not conform to anyone else’s demands. That it itself it’s why I will always admire Nate Diaz, win or lose, it doesn’t matter. Legend
10:22 i mean i did make his own belt up :D
I'm rooting for Nate so hard. Forget Kumquat
Legend
Love this guy 🥲
The UFC have been under paying this guy and he’s literally bled for the company. He is just a punching bag for them.  I hope Nate beats Khamzat so he gets the respect he deserves.
This interview changes my perception of Nate vs Khamzat, Nate appears to be a victim. He says he doesnt want the fight but he will fight anyone. If you dont want to do something, you will never do it as well as when you truely want it. I just hope Nate survives this weekend.
720p max is shameful espn
I can only hope the MMA gods bless us with an unbelievable Nate Diaz win where he chokes out Khamzat. I really hope Diaz can pull it off.  👊
Champion for shure!diaz name = fight game!
Nate should fight Tony Ferguson for the last fight.
Literally doesnt matter Diaz is gonna win or lose anyways fans are gonna cheer for him and boo khamzat before and after the fight
Nate’s fans aren’t leaving him for cum shot, if he loses…. Poor move UFC
Great to hear Nates take.
I wish his last fight would of been against gamebred that would of been 🔥
Diaz in 4
"whatever his name is" 🤣 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Banging team Diaz till the world blow 🤘🏾🤘🏾🤘🏾
the way nate talks reminds me of mike tyson
💯
Please stop talking like mike!!!
Interviever was truly amazing. Both with Hamzat and Nate. Fun to see that you made him truly happy and smiling during the process og the interviev. As it started nate was scared and angry, but he left smiling and thanking you for a great interviev. Nate slaps reporters so this was pretty amazing to watch!! 🏆
This fight is going to be rigged to set up an even bigger money opportunity for the UFC and Nate.
I understand when he said he's the GOAT.. Like if GOAT was an award he would definitly get one for the category relentless fighter or whatever it would be called
Nate "socrates" diaz
Watching Okamoto deal with the enigma wrapped in a riddle, folded into the conundrum that is Nate… He never had a chance!
The idea that a fighter could Trojan-horse everyone from his crew or his gym into UFC fighter contracts is so hilarious and preposterous. Imagine if the Diaz bros found out someone else tried to pull that. They'd be all, "I *earned* *my* contract; I'm not in the UFC because I'm someone's sparring partner or someone's buddy or someone's waterboy."
Nick got robbed of his prime years and suspended because of weed. Yet Silva and Jon jones got caught using steroids and got no punishment!!
Nate's made for reality TV, if he does anything outside of fighting. Dude has stories of a generation
Only thing yall should be talking about is how the Ufc disrespects their Legends. They  are using him as a sacrificial lamb to boost their investments
Nate is smooooooked out lol
Wish I had the same relationship with my brother I mean id fight if he did but we don’t really have that bond we should
Hate Okamoto as an interviewer. Him and Nate do not click, where's Ariel at?
LEGEND!!
Stop cenzuring his words. You are killing conversation.
Best interview ever  2 questions asked  33 min long answers. Awesome
He is a GOAT the best MF! But I feel sorry his speech is getting bad! I won’t miss this fight
“Nigannou”-Nathan “Nate diaz” diaz
Man. Idk how but Nate and Nick always have a point
I really hope he wins , but that other guys is such a talent and younger too.
you cant not argue with what he's saying 15 years sheesh mans record says winning
Can't wait to come back to Youtube in 15 years when auto-generated subtitles are powerful enough for the Nate Diaz videos.
Brett is the wrong guy to interview nate, nate is hilarious actually. You need an ariel or dc to interview him lol
You can tell from his answer it's not the last fight on his UFC contract
Well it is the first time I watch this guy and firs time watch his talk. To be honest. I am with Nate Diaz. He is just and true no matter....
I don't understand why he was never given the fight for the BELT...... He's better than those wanta be.....
If Nate wins like Francis did it’d be unbelievably awesome. Never wanted anyone to win so bad.
Nate doesn't look as healthy as he usually does pre-fight, hopefully it's a good fight and it's not one-sided.
Interviewer: Can't let you get close (to this fine couch)
Nate vs Tony would've been amazing and seems like a missed  opportunity.
Nate's such a g I hope khamzst don't hurt him too bad
Yo kamzhat is a beast.whip that black belt out the tool box MAN.suerte'^' [(😑)] if it weren't for badluck. $$$
He even ended the interview on his terms! Goat
Nate just spitting fire 👊 G.O.A.T
Please win on my birthday Nate
True Legend Much Love Diaz Army
Diaz war 😎 much respect ... No.1 forever 💪
Nate is like the baby from CTE parents
To real for this sport! Think about it for a second, every other fighter is playing a character to sell or promote themselves. Nate and Nick are the only ones who are genuinely themselves all the time. The UFC will not be the same without Nate. I go where Nate goes, if he wants to sign  with some dinky little promotion in Iceland I'm buying any ppv hes on!
Nate is the Beast
Dude's a clown
Its not surprising this guy has so many fans, always in entertaining fights and says it how it is in his interviews. I'd absolutely love to see him beat Chimaev, we all know its not gonna happen but its a big name for Chimaev to have on his record and a big fight for Nate to leave the ufc on.
“I refuse to be lame” >>>>>>>
You pull this off Nate your the real rocky
Nate is a true stoic.
Love this guy
Diaz is a Fkn Jedi 💯💯💯🥊
-IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S HE'S SAYING-  ... He speaks the REAL TRUTH man ...  ... -WOW MAN-
I'm watching this on my brothers tablet, this guy is so nice and cute looking, I 2ould love to be friends with this guy and get to know him.
Og
They don’t want Diaz to go out on top🤷🏻‍♂️
Plz pull this off brother, it'll be the biggest thing ever in any combat Sports, and will make you instantly 10s of millions I'd say
I'd love to see Nate Diaz vs Justin gaethji
I love the Diaz brothers. Glad to see him retire he should of retired fighting cerone years ago
Nate is the goat
Haha I’m 15 minutes in and I have no clue what Nate’s saying no do I care. Just keep listening.
Nate Diaz is a mix between Nick Nolte and John Malkovich
Only Nate lol he wrapped up the interview.  Hope he gets the dub Saturday.
Were all rooting for you Nate !!
DIAZ ARMY MFKRS!
Great interview from the GOAT Nate Diaz
HELLYEAH!! Let's go NATE DIAZ!!!!
Nate diaz army for life 🫡🫡 you’ve been everything ima fight fan ask for Nate, Godspeed brotha
The best interviews of all time Nick n Nate Diaz interviews
We’re gonna Spirit Bomb Chimeav.
This interview was awesome! Much RESPECT to the Diaz Brothers! They are truly LEGENDS of the sport! The Diaz Brothers ALWAYS speak the truth about the sport! And that's what I respect about them. Win or lose Sept. 10, 2022, Nate Diaz is a modern legend! I wish Nate Diaz all the best in his future endeavors as a professional MMA fighter or whatever he has planned for his future after this fight!👍
Nate Diaz has a sub .500 record for more than the last decade...... and doesn't understand why he hasn't been given a title shot..... must be a conspiracy against him. 😆
He has alot of emotions going on this dude nate about better be ready
Win or loose, for nate. After this fight I am done being a fan of the ufc
I got to love this guy
How punch drunk is Nate? I love him and have done since he won the Ultimate Fighter but he’s taken way too much damage and I think it’s time to call it a day, it’s pretty difficult to watch him try to speak and remember his train of thought, forget the questions and go off on tangents. I know him and his brother have trouble with this type of setting but is this CTE or am I just being cruel?  I want nothing more than Nate to beat Khamzat and walk off into the sunset but please Nate, do not sign another UFC deal, do your own thing!
Bret is the most condescending reporter. 🚮
Nate Diaz army 😁
Love the interview!! Nate's a 🐐 (BUT... Stop being greedy and putting Midway ADs in right at the best part of the storyline... Like wait  for a good break, 1 midway AD ok 😎. YouTube channels that get greedy and keep doing this I just bounce ✌️)
Lol Nate a weird one. But ready to see how this fight goes
Neither fighter should have accepted the fight. Khamzat has bigger fish to fry, and Nate should be working to seal his legacy before retirement...the Conor trilogy fight would be the one!
Jesus Christ is the truth reach out, nothing but respect
I'm worried for Nate. Khamzat can take him down anytime he wants and ground and pound Nate to a TKO
Jesus Christ is the truth reach out, nothing but respect
It's mind blowing that this punch drunk, brain damaged shadow of a man is allowed to fight at all... Shame on the UFC!
Oh I’m so stoked for this fight! Sends shivers down me shins
Nate Diaz by submission 💯😎
The ufc did this kid soo dirty!
Warrior level 9999! Interviews are always corny with him and Nick, just let him fight, he's great at it. People, stop being sorry for him and stop saying he's being thrown to the wolves. He's seen this before, he almost KOd Leon Edwards in his last fight.
Nate will always be number 1 in my book
He’s off his rocker! 💪Nate legend
Who is this Cumshot dude?
720p? Audio sucks? Come on, ESPN.
Crim dela crim is that how you say it - Nathan Diaz
love Diaz but am I the only one to listen to this interview and walkaway thinking, "everything Diaz said was inconsistent"?
"I'm my own champion..... " biggest excuse to never win the championship
Brett: "Mm-hm."  "Mm-hm."  "Mm-hm."  "Mm-hm."
One of the best & realest Nate Diaz interviews we’ve seen. The amount of truths he’s stated should be eye opening to UFC fans.
We need The Behavior Panel to study Nathan Diaz!
“Jon jones ?” -interviewer  “Pff out of the question!” -Nate  🤣🤣
Stand  with Diaz
The censorship is so... Disrespectful and unprofessional
Nate’s logic is wrong. He wouldn’t build anyone up if he beats them
Nate is a Champion….!!!!!
I hear Nate but they literally made a title for him to compete for
only 720P Come on! It's 2022.... jesus
I love it
Dudes full of himself.
Best 20-13 fighter in the world!!!! lol
Haha het talks for about 32 minutes straight to wrap it up with a... this was a great interview... gotta love the NDA who just told it how it is
I’m just glad that Nate explained that if you take your iPad and put it with your deer antler and then cover it with pizza your coat hanger could be good with medicine only if you use it on Thursday. I truly hope he shocks the world once again. NDA all the way
I’m a big Diaz fan and I can’t believe everyone is acting like Diaz is gonna get destroyed, I don’t think so, and if khamzat wins he will definitely know he was in a war, ,I’m betting on Diaz,
Is it me guys, or the more i listen 2 nick diaz he sounds like mike tyson. Nick will always be the goat. RESPECT🐐
How can you not love Nate
Amazing Interview and happy to see whatever he does next.  Also amazing to see such support for a real fighter.
"You do steroids I'll smoke weed and let's get in there" 💪💪
Bro the host trying too hard to act chill😂😂😂😂
Diaz vs Tony would have made so much more sense
Matt Damon could make a biopic of him
Let’s gooooooo Nate Dogg!!!
He did not say a single rational thing. Example of being hit too much on the head and too much weed.
This guy should stop fighting if nobody but me can see this dudes been punched in the head to many times he sounds like he’s got a concussion every time I hear him speak I feel bad for this dude
Spittin the truth. Wish he woops khamzat like Jorhe did Ben
The amount of people who respect you but have counted you out of this fight is ridiculous. I have every belief you are going to win, can't wait for this fight. Round 4 finish by submission and my money is already on. Chimaev ain't all he's cracked up to be, and his last fight showed it. Best of luck Homie
“I refuse to be lame” 😂
He’s right
Legendary
This man had taken a lot of punches….. He needs be done after this fight
Nate should go to Mike Tyson's hot boxing podcast and smoke with him together.
overhyped fighter purely on his silly persona, hope he gets smashed on saturday
“You do steroids , I’ll smoke weed “ and let’s go   Lmao . god Nate is the best
I love Diaz, but man they are delusional asf.
Deep down boy knows he has been fed to a wolve. You can literally feel it and feel for the guy.
I wanted to buy this to support  Nathan's last fight in the ufc most likely, but ain't no way I'm paying ESPN 124 bucks
"Maddison Square Garden Babeh watchu talm bout"
Just hoping Nate’s scar tissue doesn’t become much of an issue on the fight ending early. Go Nate
The people who don’t know how to understand how other people articulate themselves it’s easy for them to hate and not hear what they are saying, maybe it’s because I’ve heard enough of Nate but I got what he was saying.
As a diaz fan, im dissapointed seeing that the devils lettuce aint the only substance he has been indulging lately. He has never made any less sense talking... hope the best for the guy thag made me into a fighting machine..
I like nate's mindset, hope he finishes khamzat
I can’t believe you guys made a Nate Diaz interview adult friendly😂😂😂
filmed on a potato
"Let's all just talk about it, you do steroids, I'll smoke weed and let's get in there an squab...I don't give AF" - Nate Diaz
What a bunch of stupid questions!!! How do you not know your MMA history, Bret??? Where is Areial??? You’re a fooking 🤡.
Can someone stop letting Brett Okamoto do interviews
You heard it from Nate Diaz, Jon jones legacy means nothing since he tried being sneaky taking steroids and got caught
I really dislike Okamoto. The ultimate UFC shill "reporter"
UFC 141 Lesner vs Overeem is when Nate fought Cerrone. Okamoto was wrong.
@12:54 this is why Nate’s still in this thing. He’s still angry after all these years. I don’t think he’ll ever be happy until he has a belt
Best interview ive ever seen in my life
Nate seams like he’s had to many knocks to the head🤷🏻‍♂️
Vintage Nate junkie talk bla bla bla. Hope he wrote his will.
-LetsssssS GoooooO Nate LetssssS GoooooO man- .... Let's go....
Nate’s impression of usman was so good 😂
Nigganou 😂😂😂 nate kills me the way he says names
win or lose nate u r the fkn man period......
This feels even dirtier now.!
gotta love Nate
This truly was a great interview. Thank God ariel didn't do it
"This was a Great interview Bret I gotta Go " always respectful
This is so sad..... poor Nate's brain is scrambled. 30 minutes of ridiculous conspiracy theories and backward logic..... sad to see a legend Nate decline like this. I feel like he's already making excuses...... every Nate fight comes with an excuse, but this time he's building his excuse pre-fight.
Let’s go to work champ
Bro we literally watch them fighting we can’t hear curse words?
I feel sad for Nate
Man . Nate is a legend..! And only the og's know this.. .. ✌🏻
Absolutely epic end by Nate. 😂👍
209 🏆 12:40 🏆 14:35 🏆15:09
You are not alone Nate.
This is why he is and forever will be the BMF of the fight game a true champion who’s never switched up can’t wait until he does win against all odds
got to give it up to Brett that was a master class in interviewing a super tough interviewee.  He got nate to come out of his shell, and even smile and say how great the interview was at the end! as the sport grows and becomes more lucrative it only makes sense that the fighters are better organized and they get a bigger slice of the pie, some better form of revenue sharing like the other major organized professional sports.  Nate carries a lot of anger, I'm surprised that he is surprised how the UFC has behaved, it's really just entertainment and it's all about $$.  During this time of player empowerment it's encouraging to see players be more vocal.  I mean even the bench players have a minimum salary playing basketball of a few hundred thousand dollars which is certainly a living wage by any common person's standards, but the same UFC fighters that are at the bottom of the ladder still have to have regular jobs somehow because putting your health on the line for $15,000 if you win seems like a tough sale.  Nate is the perfect salt of the earth antihero.  it's quite amazing how popular he is, losing doesn't change that, which given the Arc of other fighters is remarkable.  maybe there's some lessons to be learned here.  Nate hae created his own wildly successful narrative, a story more created by himself than the UFC.
He does derail hype trains
It don't feel right if it's not happening
God Please make Nate win this fight
I agree 100% Nate fought his way through he!!
George beat your fair and square. But I'm still Nate fan againt anyone........
They trying to hurt Nate on his way out, I hope Nate win this fight
this was probably the best interview he ever had really feels like the last one when he is in the ufc he will win has last fight against khamzat i feel it
Nate already looks like he’s cut.😂
It's always the politics of the buisness, not the job itself
Nate is a funny dude 😅
its criminal that they released this only in 720p
I love Nate. But big Kudos to Uncle Dana for negotiating with this man for 15 years 👏
When the interviewer brought up Jon Jones as the “goat”  Nate “I smoke weed & you do steroids, let’s get it in there and squat. But you sneak steroids & considered? you’re outta the question. That whole legacy is gone and done with” 💯🔥💯
You can see he is hurt by the UFC and he should be!
How can you not respect this guy I hopes he arm bars chim chim
Nate’s Fights With Conor we’re the best Nate shut up Conor and the UFC was Shocked not Nate he knew he was the better fighter !
Real fight
What he said about Jon Jones is spot on.
"i ain't nobody muthafuckin champion"
This interview is sad! Seem like UFC set him for execution! You not peeing on a UFC office wall!
Nate is a genius
12:45 if you ever wondered why Nate is so popular
Nate Diaz is the man!!!
I have just as much respect for Fedor Emilinenko as Nate does. GOAT
I hope Nate wins!!   That would be a great way for him to leave the UFC!!!  He is a legend no matter what the out come will be.
men he is high)
He started it ,he finished .Nate ❤️ always even if it was against Nagnnou
The people's champ 👊🏻
Love Diaz!
‘This was a great interview Brett. I have to go’. 👏 legend.
Fight hasn’t even started and the man’s eye is already swollen. Smh.
i don't think Nate is training he even hardly breath he smoke too much i don't know what but i don't think he's serious about the sport maybe he's a street fighter not a professional fighter no hard feeling i like the guy but he's a street cat
NATE DIAZ!! Is the top 3 bosses of the UFC entirely!! Anyone who dislikes him that means that they dislike MMA altogether and should start watching golf 🤣🤣🤣👑👑👑👑👑
Man this just made me emotional
This man almost broke down in the beginning realizing everything is coming to a end for him there feeding him to dominant fighter with is bs he should have went out on a w hopefully he didn’t but it isn’t looking good
Nate's the best fighter in UFC history! Even better than Rory, Bendo, Masvidal, RDA, and Leon Edwards lol
Does Nate even answer questions? First question why are you fighting Khamzat? Answer, long rant, finally answers after five minutes of rambling
Best Brett interview of all time haha
Nate should just tap in the first minute and say peace out UFC .    hahaha
This interview is the last thing Nate wants to be doing it's written all over his face 😁
" This was a great interview Brett, I have to go " - Nate Diaz
Nate has taken a lot of damage in his career, I'm worried about this one.. hopefully he is training hard...
Great interview love Diaz win or lose
Certainly some good points he makes, it is interesting listening to him and his perspective. Good luck to ya nate. 👊🏻
Man these fifteen second ads really kill the mood.
This is the funniest and most authentic Diaz interview I’ve ever heard, therefore the best
this was a great interview brett I GOTTA GO
If this was a 6 round fight...Diaz WOULD 🏆  WIN. 🏆
Never count Nate out. My money is on him.
NATE FU**NG DIAZ. THE GOAT.
Man the energy is fuming off Diaz
Champ.
I love kamzart, I’m a huge fan of his but I would respect him more if he’d declined this fight 😞. Nate deserves some respect
NATE *ALWAYS COMPLAINING* DIAZ
It's called the Special Olympics
"You should have worked on a computer you nerd"!  hahaha!
STOCKTON MTHF. GOAT
i hope nate overturns the odds mane
Goddammit, Brett again???  Here comes some more vanilla questions whispered in monotone.  Another snoozefest.
Hey, I've trained MMA and I have legit respect for anyone that fights, but I guess I am the exception here.  This was a good interview when Nate could actually focus on answering the actual question sent to him, but he has smoked so much pot he can't hold a thought and doesn't care about being the best or being champion which is the true measure of a great.  Great that he was true to himself and entertaining, but he lost 13 of 40 fights and legit believes that he is the best fighter in the UFC!!!  LOL.  He literally got DOMINATED by Leon Edwards until one shot with a couple minutes left and he thinks he is better than the champion...  I love that he helped build the sport, but those that think he is the GOAT don't understand MMA.
Nate is an Idol to my many....people love Nate coz he is so honest and not a fake face like other fighters are...usman may hv won many fights , may hv remained a champion yet he is not an idol...just seems like another wannabe...bt people love Nate coz he is so true to his words...win or loose Nate is always a champion
The problem with Nate is that he gets busted opened a lot and takes so much damage to his head!!! He should retire soon!
Come on God. Please let this guy win on this weekend.  The UFC has done him dirty this time
Thanks Brett for letting Nate JUST TALK
.
I dunno what the fukc he’s saying 🥹
This man needs a translator
I fell asleep when Diaz started talking...:(
I hate this reporter. He's just bad at his job and doesn't resonate well with people during interviews. There's zero chemistry.
Always satisfied when the best fighter wins, but i'm with Nate on this one
Anyone who counts Nate out of any fight is crazy. Make it 10 rounds Nate wins every time
THe way the UFC has treated Nate Diaz is the reason I will continue to watch all pay per views for free on the internet.
No disrespect to Nate and what he has done for the sport, but I don't think his head is right. In his head, he's fighting the UFC and World, not Khamzat. As with his brother Nick, its time to walk away from the sport. But thank you, Nate, for everything that you have done. Much respect for that.
Nick and Nate interviews are hard to watch
The way Nate Diaz ends the interview. 😂😂😂😂
Gutter bug, arrogant, extremely dumb and zero respect. Nate Diaz is awesome, just ask him! Is he even speaking English?
This poor guy had like 6 mini panic attacks in this interview.
tell u rn im not gunna he suprised at all if nate wins this
Nate did a lot of backtracking he obviously has his mixed emotions and feelings about his whole journey with the UFC. However I do believe after hearing him say he doesn’t want to fight kHamzat he’s not interested n fighting top 10 or real gangsters. If he is the master of his own destiny and in control of all the moves prove that you’re the best fighter in the world the realist gangster go out there knock the Chechens head off and renegotiate for a higher contract that you feel you deserve. No reason to retire if you’re the best fighter in the whole UFC “Diaz”
What's up with this quality. This looks like a 1995 Oprah interview
I get high just listening to Nate talk
Good interviewer
Legend in this sport. !!!
its nate diaz army for life
I hope Nate wins cause Kuhmshot has no class, and Nate has class, just don’t wanna see him this delusional.  Like ODB with the government paranoia.
This is the real top g
Team Diaz!!!!!!!!!! Till the end of time
Diaz army
U da man big nate
How is Diaz even allowed to fight anymore? His brain is MUSH! How much CTE does he have already? smh
Nate knows Fans who back you win or lose doesn’t matter we know who real gangster is and deserves that title! Khamzat has a long ways to go to have any respect in this game and Burns came close to ending his show. Top 10 fighters and others not ranked will put a stop to khamzat it’s coming and then the hype will cool off but yes we understand khamzat is good but we need to to see him fight
Nate was always the champion for me
Did he just say im willing to fight n***words on steriods 😑😯😵‍💫 @espnmma ??
I really wanna see him win but he sounds beat. 😔
I don't think Nate's going to win but I do think he's going to make it a fight
dis just my halftime show
Nate Diaz, "just my halftime show"....yes the best entertainment fighter ever and that is the reason why people watch it.
yall couldn't put it at a better quality
Gangsta as they come. Hardcore to the bone. Talking about being your own man. Nobody owns Nate Diaz but his hood.
Nate UFC CHAMP OF UFC 😤
Nate in full effect! I won't lie. It will be a little boring not to see him in the UFC anymore.
This guy high as fukc
Nat Diaz chompion
UFC did wrong to him
“This was a good interview Brad, I have to go” 😂😂 this guy really runs EVERYTHING in the UFC. Nobody else is doing that ha.
He's a goat but needs to hang em up
Nate's jaw looks stronger than ever
Easiest fight you ever head,edwards punched your head off for 4 and half rounds ,that weed must be strong in Stockton
Nate Diaz…Marihuana guy Khabib 💭
I don’t want to see this man he deserves better.
id almost feel sorry for this guy if he didnt think he was the best fighter ever and theres some conspiracy to why he ever got to the top. like bro your not even close to the best and never was u are a slow sloppy weak fighter with a great chin and great cardio
People judge nates losses but he never has an easy fight…. Ever
Funny how if Nate pops with usada, it’s their fault and he is the UFC GOAT, and at the the same time he dismissed both Jon Jones and Anderson Silva for the exact same thing…
"the fight isn't about this guy, it's about making this guy" I've never seen Nate be so open, you can tell he's had a lot on his chest. The fact Nate of all people denied wanting this fight while Dana has been saying he asked for it is absolutely disgusting.
Why is the volume so low on this lol
I love Nate but he's a f****** Space Case
Nate can gas him if he plays it right.
One real dude 💯
Brett is a terrible interviewer if he doesn't have a script to follow
What Nate is saying is that the UFC and Dana and the whole machine controls the narrative and the UFC and champions and passing of the belts are basically scripted like WWE, and well, he isn't wrong.....
Nate is as real as it gets! Hate him or like him he is a G!!!!
Nate is Bruce LEE
“It was comedy” -Nate Diaz 😂😂
720p what is this garbage
absolutely LOVE both Diaz brothers. He is so understanding of what a true champion is.
WAR DIAZ
♦️ По глазам видно что понимает что проиграет  .
Win, lose or draw, Diaz all day... that ending was fire btw. Brett i need too goo
"Nate is the smartest guy I know" _ Joe Biden
His speech is pretty clear! nice Nate Diaz actually looks hurt that the UFC turned on him n every one doubting him
Rooting for you bro! It was pleasure watching your fights growing up. The UFC will never be the same without Nate Diaz
Nate gets him in the fourth after surviving a hellish first two rounds.
where's that 1080p at
The best 👌
Turn on those subtitles
I lost brain cells watching this
I’ve learned not to sleep on Nate any more after that Leon fight lol
he has signs of brain damage, sad.
Sad to see his brain barely hanging on after being beat senseless his entire life
The peoples champ
"If you're Mr. Goat, then make a Goat." Wow! If you understand the language Nick and Nate speak, Nate is dead on the money.
Nate talking about how it wasn’t about being champion besically because he always thought of himself as champion and all his homies at home that he t tea is with are better then everyone is such a Nate Diaz thing to say. Always believed in himself.
I love nate
I love nate but this should be his last combat showing.
"I'm on Dana Whites side too." WWWWWWHAT??? You just dogged out the company on a 20 min rant. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love him but my god I lost brain cells watching this
Nate! You are a real fighter! Big love and respect from sweden.
I swear nate reminds me so much of Norman Reedus as Daryll from The Walking Dead . Is it just me or ? Much love nate I definitely think u about to shock the world 🌎
Not everyone is saying you will  get stomped out Nate ....we riding this one out w you ....showtime
The guy is fk delusional look al his fight he lose like 15 fight and like 12 or 11 of he got his face busted up I got nothing against him but common man he only has like 5 or 6 wins in 15 years of ufc 😂
Brett SUCKS
How could u NOT love this dude?!  🥸
Video quality sucks
Your brother is irrelevant at this point. And your about to be after Chimiev beats the brakes off you. Free agent???
If you're Mr GOAT make a GOAT
We all respect Nate, he is a legend!
Brett always goes a great job . Lets go Nate
praying for you bro and bet huge on you  good luck brother
Borz has the utmost respect for Nate.   Both fighters jobs are to take heads, and sell the fight.  I love both fighters,  and there cannot be any  losers..    if the old lion can rock with the young lion and do well, and still lose, the "OLD LION"  is still a winner.
Look at nates eye he looks pissed
Forgot Brett was even there
Brett Okamoto is like watching Meghan Markle.. he thinks people like him, but none one really wants to hear what he has to say. He is un-relatable to the average fan, and only there bc Dana doesn't like Ariel.
"So why do you do it" "It's what I do".  He just summed most jobs and or careers.
This is an important interview for MMA for fighters, only if you can listen tho
I HOPE NATE WINS,, &HE WILL ALL HE HAS TO DO IS SLUG FEST TILL 3RD,, &TAKE THE DIRTBAG TOO GROUND  CHOCK IT OUT,PUT IT 2SLEEP
His Usman impression at 10:00 is hilarious😂😂😂
This dude might have some brain damage….
God bless you. You win even when you lose brother. I relate to you in many ways. Bust that fokas lip good. Eres chingon Nate!
Diaz wins this...and when I say "this", I mean...EVERYTHING. The match, the interview, the life, Everything!
There’s no way Nate is winning this fight. He’s one of the last of the dinosaurs. It’s a new era and he’s bitter. I hope Khamzat makes a sacrifice of him.
It'd be nice if ESPN would offer an uncensored version of this for the adults in the room. Why even interview Nate Diaz if you're going to edit his language? It'd be like watching Avatar in black & white.
bruh nate talking about the fight house story was funny af lololol
Nates gonna lose by scar tissue
WOW... Nate sure brings up a ton of excellent points. F*kin LEGEND
He could hardly string a sentence together. When he did it was absolute rubbish. Leon was his easiest fight? Leon dominated for 4 rounds and won a clear decision.  He's the champ? He had 1 title fight against Benson and lost all 5 rounds. He didn't come close to winning the title.
Loved hearing Nate speak so freely and openly. Great interview, I gotta go now, hahahahaha you’re a legend bro !
trash that they censored the cussing. Nate being real and spitting facts as always.
Diaz brother the best ever!
Nick Diaz in his prime would smoke Khamzat.
I'm sorry but this was painful I couldn't understand a word he said 😂🤣🤣🤣
Riveting interview! Nate Diaz has heart, the (essence)legendary movies are made of.💯
That usman impression tho 😂
If khamzat wins it’s onlybecause nate bleeds too much
I could be wrong but I think Nate was almost bringing himself to tears a couple times. He feels extremely disrespected by ufc
all jokes aside, do y’all not think he has cte already?
Nate… onviously P4P genuine gangsta
Shock finish win use cardio to your advamtage. Diaz army
Nate will always be the people’s champ! 🤛🏽
Something is wrong with Nate you could see it. He doesn’t wanna be there anymore. I hope it is easier for him on Saturday.
You just said you didn't want this fight. Yet you dog Burns for simply saying "it doesn't make sense but I'll watch it." What are talking about Nate. Is this us watching you have a mental breakdown???? Sure seems like it. You alright man???  This whole "I'm the best ever" BS is a weird look.
"ive been feeling like im going for war a long time now" tells you everything about the result of the fight :(
Didn't realise Nate didn't want this fight, UFC are disrespectful to one of their longest fighters, he should of chose his last fight
Where is the MMA guru army?! STAND UP
It's not the world against Nate!!! The real fans are all still with you!!!
This interview is like Nick has a nervous problem and goes to a psychiatrist and talks🐀
Thanks for the video, ESPN MMA
It feels a bit sad because I think that Khamzat will choke him out and thats it. I think thats not cool from Dana to give him Khmazat for his last Fight :/ Thats not what Nate deserve :/
We need a MMA guru impression of this interview
nates the GOAT
Always loved Nate and his big bro, , about as real as it gets,👍👍
i love Khamzat, but in this one I am with Nate MF 👊
And I thought chael had CTE….
“You should have worked on the computer or something, you nerd” - I work in computers, Nate. Can confirm, am nerd. ❤️
Nate: They never wanted my brother to be champion.  Dude, they gave him back to back shots at the welterweight strap and he lost both. Oh, and he hasn't won a fight since. C'mon, Nate. We all love our brothers, but be real!
Gotta love how he's persistent with fighting Francis Ngannou
F this. Love Nate win or lose! He is the true BMF
Ferguson vs Diaz at 170 was my dream fight. So sad it'll never happen now, and to find out Nate was asking for it all this time n they wouldnt give it to him 😢
Nate conducts interviews the way he conducts a fight. Slow at first, then just rips into it hahaha. Nate’s already won in my eyes
Nate took what he wanted. Remember Dana wanted Conor to win but Diaz messed up his plans
Chuck? Is that you
Hcauiwdncuiqwdcnquiedvnjdsivn aoksxiaosn sauocnasjc joasncio - Nate Diaz
"You do steroids, i will smoke weed and let's get in there" XD this guy will allways be a legend!
Regardless of win or lose, Nate is my man for ever.real gangster for life.he is the real champ even that the ufc refused to crown him.bro you are the real man out there.props to you for ever bro.we’re out!!!👊🏾✊🏾✌🏾🦾
LET'S GO!!!! NDA209 POR VIDA
NATE DIAZ IS A LEGEND PLEASE WIN SATURDAY 😂😂🙏🏼 PLEASE
FK em all      pushing for you Diaz
Nate's gonna tear him up
“You do your steroids I’ll smoke some weed and let’s get in there and squab”… best line of the interview.
My hopes 🙏 for you bro this weekend
Nate is so fried.  In a bad way, weed doesn’t do that.  He can hardly hold on to his thoughts.  Hang ‘em up bro.
His a F morun!
Man he got so real when he talked about the UFC using him to "make a dude". Love Khamzat but also wouldn't mind seeing the upset.
ufc did him dirty ... Borz will kill him
Nate is the most honest person fighting in the UFC ever.
Why is this only 720p
“Your welcome” words from Nate Diaz
Brett, it feels the same & you know who he’s fighting.. what a waste of 5 mins of opening questions 🙄
Fckng legend
I hope he gets beat so Badly he never fights again. I want hamza to send him to the hospital unconscious.
Delusional with a huge ego. The fall.
This is legal murder. Diaz has MAJOR BRAIN DAMAGE. Khamzat is literally going to put him in a chair for the rest of his life.
I can't listen to him another second.
Legend
One week away from la pela that his going to take!  He’s going back to do some burritos and tacos 🌮!
Man if he had not smoked too much, he would have become a great philosopher. Smoking sucks!
The reason why the UFC were not big on the Diaz brothers because they didn't take no s*** they didn't listen to Dana White and their little corny plans that they had to do they are the realest to ever come out of the UFC besides the Gracie's
Translator please!?
An old lion sensing he's end. This is how lions go out.
Nate only knows war....but we all don't want to see him go out on his shield.
"Pressures on you! I don't give a f..."  Let's go Nate!
Dustin Chandler would be a more sensible fight
Good luck bud
“Niganou” 😂😂😂
Brett Okamoto is a robot, change my mind.
Nate Diaz, the peoples GOAT.
Forever, one of the greatest fighters, the world has ever known. Eternal respect towards Nate's work. Living legend himself, admiration of who transcends languages and countries. A powerful man, right there. 🙏❤️
Shoot…in few angles he looked like the twin brother of Dana white
What an awful interview. They should have let Arial make this interview. Nate is the GOAT
This guy suffers from Stockton drain bamage cte real hard Jesus Christ lmfao
I'll go to war for u Nate... I represent you brother 👍👍💪💪
All love Nate!! Stockton slap that hoe!!
Bro this guy interviewing is weird vibes
Respect for khamzat’s achievements but, I’m not surprised Mother Fuckers 💯 % legendary fight really.
Hall of Fame. For sure. The realest of the realest. The Crowd is going insane 💪🦾. They will also play a facture. Love him. To me, when he and Jon Jones fights. Its give me goosebumps
It's not nate vs everybody that's bs most of us fans love him it's bs Brett you should of reminded him he has alot more support out here then most any fighter 💯  nate is the man just wish he felt/knew it. He acts like he's hated and that's far from the truth.
Nate and Nick are one of greatest fighters to ever step in the octagon
“Cuz Im willing to fight nigg@s on steriods” Nate Diaz 2022
Man I fw Nate I cant believe they feeding him to chamzat I hope nate pull off the upset.  He has an abstract way of thinking
Tupac of the UFC
Imagine... He beats Khamzat and all he says for his octagon interview is "I'm not surprised", then retires
He is like a Hispanic Mark Wahlberg that's high
Nate’s cool but this guy giving the interview is boring
Nate is the people's champ .
GOAT
Nate will probably never read this. His brother and him have given the fans so much enjoyment over the years. Thank you fellas!
Does anyone else feel like Nate has PTSD?
Betting on Nate,  idgaf win or lose gotta love the attitude 🔥💪🏾🙏🏾
Nate Diaz is a true poet inside the octagon make no mistake!
Have boy been hitting head too many times he thinks he's the best ever stepped in the cage
Diaz wanted to fight Tony.....we all wanted that fight, but they trying to kill Tony by feeding him to the Leech
Nate….bro, you are absolutely one of the GOATs.
Honestly I just want to smoke some chronic with Nate & Nick. ✊️
He needs to get on hotboxin with Mike tyson
Lame, this should be Ariel doing the interview
Nick Diaz Army MFs🤟🏾
This the fight game. Theres no reapect! - Diaz
The people’s champ  🥊
You got this
Nathan by submission, round 4!
“If you a goat make a goat”  lol Nate’s a Goat man
They definitely trying build careers off this man.
is it me or does Nate Diaz look like Matt Damon?
Bro I have to say maybe when I watch Connor and him I was rooting for Connor because he’s entertaining but after the taking the time to watch his career and this interview I’m a big Nate fan and I hope he beats this guy💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Its really sad to know this is the last time we gonna watch Nate and Tony fight. Let it sink in boysss the era is over.
Nate is so delusional 10 years from now It’s gonna be scary to see him
The ufc has never treated the diaz brothers right and they’re as real as it gets if you can hate on them then sum ain’t right with you
I would love to see Dana’s face if Diaz pulled off the upset….
Nate every one of your fights is a main event you are a champion.
Idk why but he has that Mike Tyson aura when he speaks.
Brought to you by CTE, weed, and skipping school..   jk Nate is an alright dude
I really enjoyed this. All 4 pixels of it
I think it's the first time I really got to see the mindset of Nate Diaz. Interesting point of view 🤔🤔 Interesting point of view. What I  got was he isn't a fan of the half baked sport like structure that MMA promotions. It's half - merit and half promo based, which keeps both sides unsatisfied. Fighters should either be professional and step in the cage without trash talk, or if you actually have a problem settle in person and not hide behind decision wins.
His interviews are always great but his fights are legendary. W, L or D Nick & Nate Diaz Army forever 💯
CTE is real and those little gloves  are better is a myth this guy is like already like Mohammad Ali and he isnt even finished
I'm saying Nate gets it done......... Surprise Mother F***kers!!!
Wow 16 years gone by fast 😳 i was 16 when he started off from tuf.  Man nothing but respect to this true warrior putting on a show no doubt I have a rlly good feeling that nate gonna surprise mofos once again 💯 I'm gonna bet on it and nvr better b4 so first time in my life  so God speed nate 🙏
We here baby
Seeing Nate go on a CTE/dementia-ridden stream-of-consciousness rant about being the best fighter in the history of the UFC really provides insight into why his fans are so delusional.  Edit: The Nate fan boy comments here are so cringey.
love to hear about Fedor and that he inspired Diaz to some extent. Funny how you don't hear about Fedor that often otherwise
Win or lose Nate to me Nate is legend ✊🏻
Nate's interview is more interesting than some of the championship fights and people call themselves goat by putting on boring fights....
He knows he's gonna retire after this fight. That's why he is talking like that with some pauses lolol
NATE THE REAL GOAT
Diaz fuking got too love this guy and his brother there awesome. Mega r UK. TOTAL FAN. YOU GREAT WATCH BOTH OF THEM SINCE UFC. GL NATE LOVE DOING GANGSTER TAP OUT AND SAY F U DANA BE BETTER THAN ALL FIGHTS. LOL RESPECT ✊
Real OG …..
COME ON MMA GODS !! Give this man a glorious send off and let him get a submission victory over Chimaev.. What an amazing gangster walk off to an incredible career it would be 🙏🏻 No matter what happens, he is still MMA royalty and will win either way the fight goes.
Nate is the final boss of the UFC.. original OG
Diaz Army 4 life Win Lose Draw Fan since UF when Karo tried to punk him Fan Nick since Rockstar  Both LEGENDS WARRIORS Imma need the Pettis Nate to show up Pimp Dana did both Dirty How lucky was I to be at MSG With Phoney Montana Let's GO...Nathan
People use to hate on Nate back in day even against Masvidal the comments were filled with hate. I'm glad everyone is on board finally. Hope he goes out with a W!
Don't ever mistake a goat for a sheep. The Diaz boys will forever be warriors. Forever be champions, and after Saturday night people will understand that they are bigger than the UFC.
Nate was never in a position for title ? Benson Henderson ring a bell? You had your chance n everyone knew at that point you could be controlled. Well Rory did that but he was at welter
209 stand up. I truly pray he wins. He’s stayed the same all these years and just fought win, lost or draw… He fights.
I got a bet that Nate backs out.
Just remember.. It is so wierd.. Nick diaz when he got suspended for POT he was fighting the best fighters.. And got a 5 years suspension.. Just for the ufc to push stoners.. Stoner stars that resemble nick diaz who get the easiest path to stardom. Suga sean omalley.. Stoners are 90% of the ufc roster. Justin Gaethje , jon anik, izzy, max , jon jones, shoot paddy even smokes.. But for some reason nick diaz was punished double a guy would for popping for steriods Twice. And for some reason, the ufc know how bad nick was punished, guy was unable to feed his family.. And heres his bro nate and they force him to fight a 28 year old monster who the champs are ducking
I’m hoping to see a Michael Johnson scenario!!
The world will be shocked on September 10th !!! 209 NDA for Life ! Let’s go !
Love khamzat but I'm rooting for Nate!
Realest MOFO in the Game. Respect the 209
Nate never got the belt
Huge conor fan but that was the best interview loved it
💯 GOAT 💯
The fact that Mr. Diaz is still fighting at the top level is beyond impressive. The Hall of Fame awaits!
Nate by submission 🔥🔥🖕🏻🖕🏻
Nate has been, and will always be the most real ufc fighter of all time. Hides nothing behind smoke and mirrors
Does Nate have any haters?
If Nate wins…even if he goes full 5 rounds!
I dont think Nate's the best fighter, no way, but his mentality, not many top that. Fighting is who the guy IS. Like, imagine if Urijah 'I dont feel like fighting when the time comes' Hall had a Diaz mentality? Imagine if others had that. Man, we'd have dog fights all the time.
LEGEND 💯💯🙏
The People’s Champion NATE DIAZ 🙌🏻🌟🖤
Stockton California. California Love. California Dreamin. California Republic. the West Coast. Home of lowriders and Gs, tattoos, OG Kush, beaches, and beautiful women holding beautiful bullys. Welcome to California.
Only Nate can end his interview 😂😂😂
NICK DIAZ ARMY MOTHERFUCKERS!!!
Yo this is gold!
Nate Diaz is hilarious
Very emotional interview 😢
Chandler would explode on him. Dustin would out power punch him be real 😆
Only Diaz Army 🇮🇷
“You do steroids , I’ll smoke some weed “, let’s get it on -Nate ‼️‼️🔥💯💯
Legend
You the man Nate. 🇬🇧🇺🇲 Need I say any words but "warrior of all warriors".
I swear he said I’ll fight niggas on steroids lol
Nate to me is the ULTIMATE WARRIOR! IF I HAD TO BATTLE DEMONS I'M TAKING NATE WITH ME TO BE ON THE FRONT LINE.
To think Nick almost knocked out Leon should tell you more than you need to know
Bruh this dude needs to retire the cte makes him space so hard
If Khamzat gets submitted ...UFC will have a f****ed up Night 😂😂😂😂
LETS GO DIAZ ARMY!!!!
Nate looks more & more like Nick as he ages. Definitely understood his approach. Rather than chasing the belt, he just wanted to b a BMF. Wanted to fight ppl he was interested in competing against. To prove "I can take that guy out". Can't believe it's his last UFC fight. Don't know that he'll come back. He will b missed for sure if thats the case.
Hard to watch cte in a conversation
Nate was robbed of the BMF belt, imagine a belt created for the BMF and the fight gets stopped because of a cut that the true BMF wanted to fight on.., if the UFC are going to create a BMF belt then at least play it out to see who the BMF is.
I can't c nate loosing ....
Mannnn someone make sure he is completely baked the day of the fight please!!! I love both these fighters
Imagine if Nate Diaz learn how to speak English how much more fans he would have 😳
All nates fights should be 10 rounds
“You have a blog called road too war, why do you call it road too war?” Come on whoever comes up with the questions fire em
Man I wish all the best for Nate, spectacular interview btw :)
For real dude I wanna see the so called best after 15 years in the ufc. They would most likely get sent to the shadow realm multiple times unlike Nate
I don't know... this was so sad. I heard a guy feeling like an unappreciated victim and discontent with his career. He's a sweet person that loves his bros but extremely sad.
He may be the only fighter that looks good losing or winning and never loses a stitch of popularity. He is sort of a unique cat.
If your a goat make a goat ! That hit waaaay different ! I swear this man is a legend !
Dame bro this hurt watching you can tell this man is hurting from the way their doing him. He deserves allot better because everything he's saying is so real.
This makes me wanna cry man. Real Soldier
I will enjoy seeing Nate get his eye split open again.
lol, "This was a great interview Brett, I have to go."
Wish Ariel did this interview. Sorry Brett but Ariel is the goat 🔥
Nate we all ain't saying it.  I know Gilbert beat him and you can too. I believe you will.
Nate is the GOAT!!!!
Great interview 👍 👏 👌
He dont have a fear, he the real gangster.. 👍🏾
I love this sport. but I'm gona miss when all the true fighters r gone and it's just competitors/athletes left.
my man is high af!
That's the real fighter right there. "I refuse to be lame! Nowudisayin?"
Nate seems high as a kite!
“You do steroids, I smoke weed let’s scrap”
Go nate madness diaz
Not everyone thinks you are going to lose Nathan Diaz.    I got money on you and I know you can win if you want to win.   I got mad respect for you and hope you knock him out or tap him out
The 2Pac of MMA
they should have done Tony Ferguson vs Nate Diaz - would have been fair to both of them, also just imagine the interviews
@ around 14 minutes in: "This fight's not even about this guy, it's about making this guy." Diaz is right, and he's getting screwed by a promotion he helped build. He literally says he didn't want this fight. Says it three or four times.  It would be fantastic to see him Stockton Slap Chimaev out cold, but that's just not going to happen. And I think Nate knows that. UFC bites sometimes with these fights. It's like watching boxing. Sucks.
“I refuse to be lame” 😂😂😂 legend
If you are a goat then make a goat. Nick made nick, connor made Artemis, khan in made Islam. 🙌
He looking a lot like nick... i.e old lol
I hope Nate wins, as a final big middle finger to Dana.
This dude needs to retire he shoot it's terrible 😔
10:35 so much truth and wisdom to this if you actually pay attention a lot of fighters who came in as hype trains and where stopped usually have a hard time getting back into that winning streak there a very few fighters in the ufc who are durable and Nate Diaz is the perfect example of one of those fighters look at Cody gardbrant ,Michael Vick,Johnny walker,luke rockhold ect Diaz is a true fighter he was born for it
RFI -StFUp  Real Fight Incooperated - Straight the F*** Up   Best new fight promotion
One of my fav ufc fighters we love you dog
"Fedor Milanko" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Bless his heart Lord.
“Its been feeling like ive been going to war for a long time” watching both him and his brothers interviews never cease to make me both insanely excited, and also very sad and emotional. From watching with my dad when I was 8 years old, to now.
Nates so braindead “I’m the champ of the whole ufc” meanwhile I got like 16 Ls on my record lollll
Lets go Nate!!!!!!!!!! You got this!!!!
Yea honestly i cant think of another fighter in the ufc that is as equally loved and respected whether he wins or loses as Nate Diaz.
Love Nate been to a couple seminars, trained with him and been partying  with him. Real down to earth guy.
FINALLY
nate Diaz peoples CHAMP
Marijuana is more of PED than steroids 😕 CHANGE MY MIND
“Bunch of nerds” made me spit my tea out. 22:09
NDA
This entire interview is trash lol this dude just rambling cte
My boy is ALLOTA things. Tough as $2 stick, skilled, gangster. But articulate is NOT,...one of those things.
Nate is the man
He ain't wrong
Nate should have been given PPV points for this last fight
This interviewer ask really dumb desperate questions
Why is he so goofy? Is it just pot or is there something else?
I've been waiting like 15 years for Nate to cough up whatever's been at the back of his throat all this time.
Him and Nick have never been my favourite fighters but if you don’t respect what they have both done and been through you can’t even call yourself an MMA FAN, I just wish Nate was capable of expressing himself more openly and a lot more clearer. I think he gets distracted by what he’s about to say next
Well if Nick is the GOAT, GSP beat him so that makes him the GOAT.
Bro already accepted hes going to lose, thats hella sad how dirty hes getting played
you can literally see where his eyebrow is gonna split open lol. i hope it doesn’t get cut early because nate’s eye brow boutta fall the f off
Let’s not forget he almost beat the current welterweight champ in his last fight!
Casuals just dont get it. Respect to Nate
Nate... you fought the LW GOAT for the title and got ABSOLUTELY mopped up!!! I wish their was a 165 cuz maybe just maybe...
Nate is as real as anything can be.. always true to himself.. all respect
It's impossible not to like a mad man like nate
Starting to seem punch drunk
When is the last time Nate won a fight ?
I want Nate to win just because the UFC thought they were just setting him up for execution. But man!!! Nate has a hard time collecting his thoughts and words, that CTE ain't no joke.
Living Legend
Dana is the Bob Arum of mma, I hope Diaz wins & slaps dana pink lol
And Conor built him and made him all that money
LFGOOOOOOOOOOOO
You know Nate be smoking when he bring up the BJ Penn-Robert Deniro comparison
I like Nate but he sounds like a hater when he says that Jon Jones ain't the goat. My opinion Jon Jones and Khabib are the goats. Even tho Usman lost to Leon he still a beast. And he claim to be a gangsta so why is he getting bothered when Khamzat talks about his ganstarism. I hope Nate  don't get smashed.
Much respect to Nate. & Although anything is possible inside the octagon. I can't see Khamzat loosing this match.
bien brulé
Amazing how they still silencing cursing in the US. Slinging guns out of each pockets but ooh wee if someone drops the F bomb
War Diaz!!!
Best interview yet! Great job guys!!
Respect this man but he should be called nate de.veg
🐐
Phonemenal emotional interview.
Legend ! End of an era
I love DIAZ brothers ...3rd Round Submission win
I’ve always respected Nate because of the dawg in him. This  brought out the warrior in him. Everyone says they are a gangster. Most need to sit down and keep quiet. The real gangster is talking.
I want to here him speak Spanish por vida
"I'm champion of the whole UFC. I don't give a f$%ck."
Love him . Win or lose Nate is amazing . Stepping in the octagon with that killer shows what a freaking man he is . Doing this fight is a master move . He can’t lose either way and will be out of contract with the UFC. Nate is the most loved fighter in the history of the UFC . The real champ .
Translation: Khabib only fought like 3 top ranked opponents after getting the interim belt. Usman beat 6 top guys but only finished 1 out of those 6 and lost to Edwards who Nate almost TKO'd while coming in inured...No one has fought top guys for 15 years straight- not even RDA although he comes closest after Nate to highest competition for longest amount of time straight.
Nate has a bunch of losses he’s delusional he contradicts himself over and over I like him I guess but he’s crazy, see a lot of fanboys here too 😂
Speaking so much facts. I felt that… Nate you are always the G.O.A.T You really are the ultimate fighter while all the other’s are fighting to be the ultimate winner.  This why you are the peoples champ! Love you Nate man! You will always be the champ in your own way and that’s why you are a living legend within the sport
Nate’s impression of Usman was the BEST!! I freikin love Nate! You are the champ in the fans eyes!
I understand what Nate saying. In Pride figures fought the best.
The Kamaru impression at 9:51 is so hilariously spot on I’m dying 😂😂😂😂
Man of few words Diaz
Nate Diaz is the real Peoples Champ. Nick Diaz Army
Sorry Khamzat can’t root against Nate Diaz!
In all seriousness, we need to be concerned about this guys mental health
I think he’s trying to communicate with us
Man I hope Diaz wins!
Nate aint some 10-0 rookie like Khamzat. this fight way closer then people think. the only real advantage khamzat got is in the wrestling. but when it comes to jiu jitsu and boxing, i think Nate gon slap him up
Love Nate
...that sounded like a therapy session....so fkn good though!!..Go Nate!!!!!
Does Nate speak Spanish?
diaz army always
That last story of him in tuf and angry Dana is freaking hilarious . This dude the goat 🐐
Nate go show the world bout the Diaz army baby!! Not going lie tho I wanted him to fight Dustin but like nate said he not done in the ufc this just his half time show then go fight Paul come back to the ufc n show em up!! LFG!!! This isn't a good bye this a see you later in the ufc baby!!!
Win ,lose ,or tie Team Diaz until we die 👊🏼
"Been feeling like am going to war for a long time."  Dam I felt that! I stand behind my boy Nate Diaz! Lets get em UFC279!
I can honestly say Nate Diaz is the reason I love this sport. Warrior, heart, chin, blood and cuts for days. The definition of a certified killer
This Irish-Mut is stoked to see Diaz back,get em dog!
M.DIAZ YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE KILLER VIBES IN THE RING👌
"If you're Mr. GOAT , then make a GOAT" woah, what a line!
Cum shot is going to get his head ripped off if you guys really think Nate is going to let this guy walk over him you have been smoking way too much crack LOL trust me homie is preparing leveled up I feel sorry for cum shot everybody is hyping him up so he's not going to be prepared for when those jackhammers start coming at him literally Non-Stop and then when he gets caught and the s*** just doesn't stop
This dudes brain is literal mush
9:48 P4P headshot dead
This interviewer is a hater and is trying to get in nate mind nate don't let them make u depressed u a king man and the king of ufc win lose or drew go give it ur all
Has it been confirmed wethor or not DIAZ got the eyebrow taken care of
Diaz Army Mfs!
Nate has the chin of a lion. What a badass I can’t wait to watch this!
Nate is talking sense he's a real gangster
This interviewer seems like he's playing a bad shrink.
720p? thats it?
Nate just called him "nigganou" 😂 20:00
oh man how I want this guy to win via KO or via submission... I hope stars will align... He is one of the last fighters of that era when this sport was more real.
I love how no matter what question the reporter asked him he just goes on a tangent and talks about whatever he wants lol gotta love this dude! “Well this has been a great interview Brett but I gotta go” The interviewer doesn’t stop the interview Nate Does!
The way he speaks about Nick... love right there...
Nate is the only white man in the world that has a N-word pass on national tv
Ohhh you are a inverviewer now hahahahahaha 95% talking rate
Love how she's sky high just as Nate would always be :)
Nate’s impression of Usmsn was toooo funny loool
Respect!
One of his best interviews
This is a retirement fight I think
9:50  Everybody gangster until nate impersonated kamaru usman
“This was a great interview Brett”😂😂😂😂
Brett Okamoto i‘m sorry for him hahahaa he spoke 95% of the interview. He got your job
" if you're Mr Goat then make a Goat...." Shits so dope.
Nate has an old school street mentality that can't be taught. He's the people's champ because he goes to war. He isn't fighting for points but respect and admiration. HOF for sure.
This guy's brain works like a bicycle on ice
Someone losing to khamzat just sounds logical, but because it sounds logical is cause chimaev is so good and he can kinda humiliate people
he twitches a lot, maybe cte??
The man’s got a point
Nate is real and he knows what he thinks. Good to see him open up. Pretty cool.
due to the lacerations on Nathans face the fight will end round 3 *prediction*
@14:30 “Hmmmm… this just my half time show” 😂
MF looked like Robert De Niro in the Irishman when he's narrating how he killed Hoffa
It's kind of sad, this young man will probably not be able to speak in 10 years. The TBI is so noticeable 😔😞 it's not the weed.
In so many ways, he's sounding so much like his brother. It's crazy. Good and bad. Obviously they've always had similarities but this sounds like Nick's words with Nate's voice.
I'll be sad to see Nate go
Nate is gonna pull out last second...
Nate seems very emotional heading into this fight. I sincerely hope he wins, but I don't know that his head is right for this one.
I like Nate and I’m a big fan but he really thought out a very complex excuse for never winning the championship for no reason his fans don’t care he never got the strap
Nate is so punch drunk
WARDIAZ
As a huge fan (of both brothers), I found this painful. He knows he's being thrown to the wolves, but he's gonna give it all he's got. Disgusting matchup for a guy that's given everything to the UFC. God I'd love to see him win.
Nobody would ever understand Nate fight mentality. His mindset is from the old school UFC days. Respect!
Take anything from this Nate does what he wants, even ended the interview on his time
Take Steven A Smith voice off the MMA videos CLOWNS 🤡
This dude could have been way more dominant if he would have just broadened his striking. I mean even mixing elbows and knees into his striking would have multiplied his win rate.
Haha shades Oliviera 👌
If you're a ufc puppy dog,  they'll give you a rematch.
Stoned or drunk?
Nate Diaz will shock the will world again. I said it believe Me.
Ufc doing the Diaz brothers dirty yet again. We all got your back Nate!!!!!!
Khamzat is a good dude but won’t reach the bottom of Nate’s shoe when it really comes down to fan base don’t overdo it buddy 😭😭😭
This was hard to watch a little I love Nate though wish him the best against my fav fighter Khamzat it’s hard for me to choose who I want to win hha
Don’t count out Stockton, Ca. Nate is a stud!!! Nate’s right!! pressure on them! Nate puts Kazmat out in 1st round then what. Nate has done this over and over. He is in his element. Putting G on Nate to win.
I don’t know that there has ever been an interview that has made no sense and total sense all at the same time like this.  I’ve been a fan of Nate since he was on the Ultimate Fighter.  He’s the BMF champ in my opinion.
That exit though…
Great interview on both Brett and Nates part. Wishing both the fighters all the best before, during and after this wild encounter we're about to witness THIS WEEKEND! LET'S GO BABY! 💪🤘🙏🐯
Is it only me or the max res is only 720p???
OGGGGGGGGH
will watch a diaz fight any day
Nate is right about Usman, like oh you don’t want to fight Adesanya bc he’s your friend?? 🤔
we couldn't get 1080p quality vid espn?? come on
Excellent interview. Representing So. Cali. here, Nate do what you do brother.
He definitely has no brain left
I'm not saying it NATE ?  I think this dude looks dangerous but I 100 percent put my tenner on nate , noone brings it like you bro , this is his hardest test so far an he's about to meet a legend,  regardless of age , timing , the result, the diaz brothers are a generations way of manning up and they have there own style! 70 percent power punches ,fast slick combos , spirit of a lion , a true pleasure to be able to admire it , good luck CHAMP
DIAZ DIAZ DIAZ
Why dose the UFC want to buried Nate Diaz 🤷🏻‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️ he brings some much to the ufc when Nate fight is like when canelo fights it’s a celebration 🍾 he Nate fights it’s the only time I pay for a PPV
Stockton brothers will live forever for true MMA fans....One mord time MMA GODS LET HIM WIN ..and say MF to UFC
Nate reminds me of a young Mike Tyson.
Idk why but in a way this event makes me sad, Nate's last fight and likely Tonys as well, say what you will about both of them, they stayed true to who they were no matter the circumstance, in a world that thrives in being fake, these 2 have optimized what a bmf is, much respect for 2 legends
Nate Diaz is an OG and a “needle mover. You don’t have to like him but you gotta respect him
After watching this. He has no chance.  He can't even speak.  He's gonna get hurt bad.
“It don’t feel right if it’s not happening” that’s real af
this gotta be one of my favorite interviews lol
Great insight...and I love him...but too much victim mentality for me.
Brett’s entire energy is “I’m being super nice. Please don’t hit me”
Realest mf ever to step inside the octagon. True OG.
I feel bad for him and hope he wins man I hope he wins go Nate
Nate is right in everything here!GREAT INTERVIEW
He's not wrong whether you like him or not. Ufc hopes khamzat beats nate and skyrockets because of it
Nate is a living legend and has the top 5 most submissions in UFC history.  Khamzat has takedowns, but his BJJ is nowhere near Nates.  Khamzat is not a boring wrestler, he will bring it, which will play into Nates strengths.  Bad fight for Khamzat imo
Let the truth be TOLD! Thank You Nate! And interviewer
This ia not right...he shouldnt figh khamzat...nate aware of that. Hes old...why they gave him khamzat. Is only damage.
Brett is a solid guy in his field but he is not great at interviewing.
Plz let Nate finish him man
When Nate talks, you Listen.
Yes!!
Respect for super honest interview. It's gonna be be hard to do as he is fighting against a younger killer but if he gonna pull this out it will be crazy. Khamzat kinda gas out in Burns fight and it was 3 rounds long fight, if they will go to 4th and 5th it could be interesting.
The ufc should should have an open weight tournament.
I really hope Nate pulls some crazy unexpected win off. It’s possible it’s Nate Diaz
this dude gotta be the toughest
Man Nate truly isn't afraid to fight ANYONE!!!!
He fought Rory Markham LMFAO
Nate has me rollin
Half the time I have no clue what nate is saying, but I love it
U do steroids, I'll smoke weed and let's scrap,  love this dude
🐐
debate settled, jon jones aint nothing but a title winner. "out of the question" wasss good
I like Chimaev but as good as he is, if u really think he’s going to just walk through Nate Diaz then you’re obviously a ufc casual. Chimaev will most likely win but make no mistake this will be a war!!
Nate loving his brother breaks my heart and fills my heart every time.
Gotta love nate speaking fact all day ... that dude better get nate out in one round or idk its gonna get interesting
Yoooooo
Nates got that look in his eye for this one, reminds me of killer nick.. don't be surprised muthafuckers 😎
What an awkward individual.
Worst interview combo the ufc could have done, someone who doesn’t engage and someone who struggles to get anyone to engage
I 100% believe Nate would love to fight Ngannou lol
llool Nat is high lol or he is on drugs...lol he thinks he defeated Leon Usman Khabib  looooool, He thinks he is the champion of all UFC...lol Soon khamazt is going to smash his entire face
interviewer is baaaad
I have no clue what he means while knowing exactly what he is saying 😆
is the audio quiet af for anyone else and why is the video quality 720p lmao so upset rn
Nate is a great fighter, takes a beating and keeps coming back for more. In a moment of weakness, Nate admitted he didn’t want to fight Khamzat. He knows he’s going to get throttled. This isn’t your 1/2 time show, this is your last go. 15 more years? Take your 14th loss and enjoy your retirement.
What a warrior! Only weak fighters pick easy fights. Hes a champ no matter the outcome.
Okamoto the worst interviewer for this. More whale questions lol can we please get ariel lol
This interview is why everyone loves Nate.
😂😂burns got burnt down in this.
I understand why people want Diaz to win but imagine if khamzat becomes the undefeated monster that we thought he would become, we would get tons of crazy mega fights, Khamzat vs Israel which would sell like a mf, khamzat vs Jiri would be insane too, but if he lose to Diaz then it’s all over. I am rooting for chimaev because him being a monster will only bring us many amazing superfights, I hope he becomes a megastar
He most likely won’t, but with all this talk about going against the organization, wouldn’t it be dope if he came out to “Bulls on Parade” or some other rage against the machine song
Love it when Nate opens up about how he feels about the UFC and everything surrounding it and the ranking system bs lol
Okay "you'll do steroids i'll smoke weed and we'll just get in their and squap" is the single best line i ever heard HAHAHA 24.05
greatest fighter lol
I Love Nate’s fighting mindset
I don’t understand why Nate complains about the UFC. Its a business. All businesses have things they have to do to make money.
John Jones, Who?
Kahmazat is already getting stupid,  with the approach of  Costa not by himself but with his whole team. Doing it for the cameras and letting everyone know that he'll fight anyone.  I'll be in Vegas I'll approach him and see what's up.
lol I like him, but he is not on lots of these guys level lol
It seems to me that the fighting business is both a blessing and a curse for Nate.
Northern California
Brad
Ferguson VS Diaz would be awesome👌💪👌
The real Top G
I just can’t watch him speak it’s sad
I have a feeling he wont even try just to get this contract done.
Dang he starting to sound just like his brother did at the end
Nate will draw pay ver views were ever he goes next true legend
CTE..
About Nate slap khomshot of wherever his f*****n name is and walk away but I Kwon he has  to much pride in is blood that he going to kill or be kill
People are going to be surprised by this fight regardless of what they think of khamzat doesn’t completely roll over him in the first round everyone hating is going to look silly. Either way Diaz army all day !
Nate a real OG
This is the aftermath of getting your head smashed in, feel sorry for him against Khamzat - it's like sending a Dog to Kill a Bear!
Nate looking more like nick every day
Dude can’t string together one cohesive statement.
This is the same situation as when he fought Conor, all the media and fans will be surprised if Nate catches him tired after the 3rd
This guy is a absolute legend of mma!!!
Nate Diaz BABY THE ONE AND ONLY!! FOREVER WITH THE DIAZ ARMY!
13:40 *Yes sir, u sure are.*
An interview with DR Okomoto... Nate must be going crazy inside feeling like he's talking with a psychiatrist..
turn da audio up pls
Nate's a G
Nate IS the UFC!!!
woah gtfoh!! espn has fire mma content? since when?? (YouTube game. ik they host all the ufc fights)
Nate beats olivera. if UFC fights were 7 rounds, who you got?
he has brain damage more than most
I respect Nate. He don’t give a f¥Ck. Just doing his thing.. 🤜🏻🤛🏼
Absolute legend. Always loved Nate followed him his whole career always been a fan of him and his brother nick. Nate Diaz is too real for the ufc. Love the Diaz brothers lets go Nate Diaz
I’m rooting heavy for Nate.  💪💪💪
Team Diaz
Everything he says is dead accurate I'm not no Fanboy guarantee you that but. it is what it is nobody can stop Nate and that's what it comes down to it's so weird how some don't think that Nate is the baddest dude in the UFC I just don't no how anybody could say otherwise he's done it all .. and if you haven't had as many fights as Nate you shouldn't even bring his name up you're not on his level. Until you do
After watching this fight.. khamzat by first round brutal ko
32:10 This was hilarious!
Guy only has ever fought the best. Conor, Masvidal, and Edwards got title shots after beating him. Fought RDA, Cowboy, Gomi, Rory, gray, MJ, Pettis, all top 5 and former champs or challengers
Him thinking he beat Leon is delusional.
Nate’s a real G. Can’t wait for the Conor v Nate Trilogy. They both deserve it and we need that fight, it’s history.
I actually love the blasting of Kamaru hahaha 100% true
Legend
People complain that Nate doesn’t fight frequently enough. With the kind of damage he takes, I’m glad he only fights once a year or every 2 years
Conor took credit for making other fighters rich shortly before his fight against Diaz.
Ariel Helwani wouldve been able to recall that brock lesnar card
I believe in you Nate. You got this!
Cte has entered the chat
All I care about is the first Stockton slap on Chimaev's face.
I hope Nate hangs it up after this one, win or lose.  He can run a gym because he already has a brand in himself.  He can mentor up and coming champions.  I don't want to see him punchier than he already is.  I love combat sports but I hate what it does to some of the athletes in their late careers.
Nate speaking facts
he’s hilarious
Joe Biden might have been a fighter in his younger days.
One last time Nate get this W bro.
The homeboys at home in northern california are no joke. lost isles stockon ca for life baby ...
Gone back to the dad punched him a few more times, only real Gs will know 😎
awesome interview
brett okamoto sucks
Fun fact: Nate fought Josh Thompson for $15k…& fought RDA for $16k..
I'm rooting for you Nate. Win,lose or draw you and your brother are the realest niggas to step into the cage
My favorite athlete
As a combat veteran, many times over, it gets annoying to hear these fighters say they are going to “war”. These fights are nothing close to “war”.
That ending was almost mike tyson like
The UFC trying to diminish his value and building someone else’s on his way out. No respect towards him from the UFC.
After almost 30 minutes I have no clue what Nate is even talking about 😭😭😂😂😂
Thank you Nick. Thank you for creating and molding your brother into a God of War.
Camera quality?
Love this interview. Old school gangster.
I really, really wish Nate all the best. A true warrior.
Nate brain 🧠 dead
Conclusion-  UFC is great but FCUK UFC too     ~ nate diaz
720p?
Good luck Nate go out like a warrior.
What did he say
Win Loose or draw this man changed the sport by just being himself in the world of PR machineries and lame wannabes.
Nate Diaz is the 🐐
“If you are a goat make a goat”
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nate and nick totally awesome 👏
It's astonishing to see how completely delusional the Diaz brothers are. I'd love to jump in Nate's head for a few minutes just to see how his brain works. What's he thinking? "I have a crappy 20-13 record, and my _only_ notable win was against Conor McGregor -- all the rest were mid-tier fighters or washed-up has-beens. But I'm still the BEST or 2nd-best fighter ever in the UFC, because, um, I'm an exciting fighter who's been around  a long time. 🥴"
This man is speaking facts gotta love the Diaz brothers
"You should have worked on a computer somewhere, you nerd." 🤣🤣🤣  gotta love Nate!  and hes so right! 🤣🤣
Nate Diaz telling it like it is 😎👍
I’m so behind and rooting for Nate,  I’m not surprised MF
Punch drunk uneducated MORON !!!
💯
NATE PROBABLY GONNA WIN
If you’re Mr. Goat then make a Goat!!! Classic line!!! Khabib is making Islam as we speak
The ufc done Nate wrong. Hope Nate takes him out like he did Connor who they thought nobody could beat.
When the guest ends the interview without getting and Real question ask that was a awesome interview (what it realy was) it only can come from nate
NickDiazArmy! newbies will never know
Am I the only one that thought they had a bad Bluetooth connection for the first 10 minutes of this interview and then just realized they have to bleep out every other word Nate says?
Brett Okamoto can't take interviews. Guy is just incapable of thinking on his feet.   Nate basically carried this whole interview.  Okamoto is the luckiest untalented guy. Ariel is 10 times better than him.
He's the man love nate
He's not wrong. The UFC should have honored him.
If drunk text was a person!! Love this guy!!
As I was listening to the energy behind his words, I'm still a Nate Diaz fan, but I believe that Nate thinks that Khamzat will beat him, for why he still doesn't want to fight him. Basically.
Nate is the real fighter. He wants to keep it real. UFC likes to stage stuff.
Man diaz hit that on the head!!!!! They are using diaz to make this dude their lap dog.
Nate dropping the N bomb at 23:55😂😂😂 love it
what's up with all the censorship??? this is the internet, you don't have to bleep the guy
I named my first born after the Diaz bros his name is Diaz
I’ve never been a fan. I’ve rooted for him, especially against McTap. This interview hit hard.   I hope he wins now.
“This was a great interview, I have to go!” Even ends his interviews in the best most exciting way!
please Nate never lose fight against muslim please
nate’s speech is starting to resemble mike tyson, greats resemble greats
Nate is a legend no mater what happens go on team diaz
They won't let me go.. I'm gonna be in the UFC for 15 more years, I'm the best
Nate 🐐
Top G(OAT) of UFC :  Nate DIAZ
Nate you should slap this reporter next time you see him
Word.     😤
Calling it now Diaz taps out 1 second into the first round and gives Dana the bird
“Great interview Brett. I’ve got to go!” Deuces. ✌️  😂
“I refuse to be lame”.    Guys, take note.
i love nate man. hes a champ to the people and me
Reminds me of nick before his last fight Nate’s gonna get murdered in there
Diaz brothers are the best it sucks that after this we prob won't see them in the ufc anymore guess it's my last match as well
He sounds like CTE is starting to kick in.
My favorite part about the Diaz brothers is that you ask them a question , they go off on a tangent for like 30 minutes lol .
I love the Diaz brothers but they are some of the most delusional people I've seen.
Brett: "of all the names, why khamzat?" Nate goes on a 20 minute rant about how he never wanted to be champion, Usman, how he "basically beat Leon", etc.  Bro.  I know people will say this is how Nate is, but for real ... Def concerned about the mental health/CTE of both Nate and Nick.   I really don't want to see the beaten he's gonna take from khamzat 😢.
Wish you didn’t cut audio on the cuss words. Let’s hear the man’s words. He’s hard enough to understand. Why make it worse 🙄
this is like interviewing a retard, cant wait for this fool and his drooling fanboys to disappear from existence
Diaz army all day everyday mofo
Authentic Diaz stuff ! Best PPV ever.
U have to have that me vs the world mentality he’s not telling anything I don’t know about him
Yo this man sounds like he has the onset of CTE his speech has changed. Be well son
Him and his brother are delusional. Let's be honest
Wish ariel did this one
Nate Diaz for life
I love Nate but doesn't seem like he's 100% in the head. He can't hold a coherent line of thought. And nick is the same. It's not CTE either. My bet is that it's Marijuana. No other fighters smoke more weed than nick and nate
While a normal person might see Nate as a bad speaker. I pretty much understood exactly where he's coming from. Look at Pettis for example, he was THE guy. They had him doing commercials, interviews, Wheaties boxes. But as soon as he lost the belt they stopped all that. Nate wasn't looking for the belt because to him in meant nothing. Having the best opponents, best fights, and most money however means everything to Nate. And he's been doing just that for a long time now.
Realest of the realest dudes period.
Nate Diaz is the type of friend everyone deserves in their life. MFer that will always be real, honest, and will go to war if needed.
Nate vs Khabib would’ve been insane to watch. So sad it’s nearly the end of the road for him soon. What a legend.
Love Nate Diaz, but half the time I have no idea what he is going on about!
It don’t feel right, if is not happening. -Nate Diaz
Nate Spittin Real!
Wow man is broken, seriously hope this legend brings it
Nate wakes up at 12:38
"You do steroids, I'll smoke weed, lets get in there and squab"- G Nate Diaz
Amazing to see how elevated Nate has become in his MMA journey. I am partly hyped to celebrate him on Saturday and pissed at the UFC for making this fight. Not saying Nate can't win because he can, but this does not feel like the UFC is celebrating all that Nate has done for them.
We deserved Ferguson Vs Nate
His first Usman impression was funny
I really hope by some miracle nate pulls off a win. This dude is different
nate is cool
I refuse to be lame  - Nathan Diaz
Mad struggle to form thoughts and ideas into words here once again.
“You should go work on a computer NERD!” Classic. Mad love from the 209!
Nate is love ❤️ a true champ .
Khamzat barely beat Burns, if that. Let's go Nate, you can do it!!
Love Nate and Nick. Diaz brothers 4LIFE! Tired of the UFC shitting on them. There a huge reason why the sport is so successful. True warriors
In his own words describing the evolution of the sport. It's definitely different now the whole sport was about who the baddest mf on the planet is and they didn't make that much money. It's good to hear him open up notice nate never talks...I wonder how this guy got him to open up.
Hope nate wins
OFF-THE-RAILS
Love how Nate forget Khamzats name
Nate showed zero confidence , zero anger.  Just showed “upset and sadness”.  Said on more than one occasion “let’s say I get stomped”.  He never once said he is taking this and channeling into something.  I hope I got it all wrong but after this interview I don’t like his chances at all.  Seems like he has the “poor me I’m gonna lose” attitude.
Talking about the business! You gotta fight on a bad day In this business
He said "Francis NIGGANU"😂
I hope Nate pulls it off. Itll be the worlds best f$@k you.
33:26
"I'm for real in the fight game. It dont stop and wont stop. "
Nate Diaz, true people´s champ! He will always be loved, there is just this innate charisma, humility and authenticity about him that shines through, almost like this childlike innocence, the essence of purity, which can be sensed about him.
This guys sounds like mike tyson when interviewed.
Let’s go bro
this man needs to stop fighting. Dude can’t even put a sentence together
Every fighter has like a 5-7 year lifespan in the ufc. Not Nate Diaz, this man has been doing it at the highest level for 15 YEARS. This is what makes him a goat!
I feel dumber listening to this
He looks soft... hope he taps early and gets the paycheck
Lets go baby Diaz Army!
He left the door open to resigning 🙏🏼 give the man what he wants Dana
He’s full of surprises
“I’m the champion of the entire UFC. This is just a halftime show brought to you by Real Fight Incorporated.”  Classic
Nate sounds crazy at first then flips the genius switches on us. He's saying some strong facts that few people can get away with saying.
Yo diaz usman impression wasn't bad
Guy doesn’t make any sense he’s so brain dead nowadays he’s about to get that a$$ whooped again. He’s getting paid to be the typical punching bag he is! What a journeyman 🤣🤣😎😎
he's starting to sound like Nick. i hope his shxt dont go down like Nick did
I highly recommend watch the resume review of Nate Diaz on Morning Kombat... dude has had a wild ride
REAL
God bless this man
Nate diaz is gangster you know
Imagine Nate at a Job interview for Target
I believe the UFC does give certain fighters a push similar to the WWF for example Costa.   Masvidal they pushed McGregor long after he was that good and now arguably Khamzat so we’ll see.
Thank you for your blood sweat and tears for all these years. I know your going out leaving it all in the octagon. Salute Nate!!!
"Should have worked on a computer somewhere nerd"
I'll fight all of them in 5sec🤣🤣🤣
Nate always sounds like he’s about to cry. Much love to him tho what a G
12:47 .  "They are acting like i called for this Fight, which i didnt call for and i dont want didnt want and still dont want".   Hes saying it right there.
it’s crazy how u just can’t help but love nate diaz .. he’s the realest 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Nate hasn’t changed…. He really don’t gaf about interviews 😂😂😂😂
This whole video was Nate just spouting off nothing but nonsense
Mike Tyson type vibes u can just see it in him👌 this is his life🙌🙌 big love NATE!!
I think nate is gonna give it all in the octagon this time, unlike vs edwards i think Nate is up for a statement and i can see in his eyes how bad he wants this win. Diaz by sub in 4th or Tko in 5th.
LEGEND
Am I the only one who feels at first he seemed pretty emotional?
i watched both nate and khamzat interviews and have no idea what either of them said but i can’t wait for the fight.
Hazmaev fans thinking that goat milk is the same with G.O.A.T.
It’s true bro he feels hella slighted by the UFC I hope nate wins I was finna bet the house on cumshot but nah not after this !
I fks with Nate all day….. this dude is reall all day.
NFL is back and this fight on Saturday. This a great weekend for sports.
Nate’s perspective on why he’s fighting Chimaev is mad when you think about it. They don’t want to let Nate go unless he makes somebody. Imagine the scenes if he submits Khamzat🔥🔥🔥
"I'm the champion of the whole UFC, I don't give a Fu( K.  - Nate DIaz 2022
Nate is a g but man is it hard to listen to him try to explain anything
"The pressure is on him, he better finish me."  Say what you want about Nate, but i honestly dont think this man knows the concept of fear.
EPIC!
I won money on Nate when he beat Conor the first time everyone doubted him and they didn’t realise until know how good Nate is at fighting I’m glad I’ve known that for years
Never underestimate a Diaz Brother.
Go Nate!!   You got this brother!
Nate has been Dana's gatekeeper for a very long time
Props to Brett for letting Nate ramble on and not interrupt. Nate was hilarious 🤣
Nate sounds like his not ready to leave ufc...its almost like he cant believe that his fighting career is coming to an end, when all u knew was to fight how do u start living a normal life...u still the biggest GANGSTER OF UFC NATE 🥊👊👊
The Hype Train Killah
Nates one of the best guys to step foot in the octagon, real guy
So how did the Dana fight almost get started?!
No nate we rock with you !!!
Huge fan of both these men. Nate is a LEGEND. Just hope he doesn’t pull the upset, don’t wanna see Khamzat with a -1. But I do hope Nate puts on some work.
This was a GOAT interview 🙌🏾
You can tell he’s got the jitters for this fight, he low key scared of khamzat
13:36 Nobody.
You do steroids and I'll smoke weed, let's get in there 😂😂❤️❤️
Real G
Its still the nick an nate Diaz army
Love this dude!
I really hope he wins his last Fight. He s the definition of a warrior. Huge respect to this guy.
Let’s hope that Scar Tissue isn’t going be factor in this fight, This fight will be on the ground for most of the fight Khamzat wrestling with Diaz JuJitsu style. Don’t be surprised if Nate gets him in choke with fingers in the air.
209 all day
I hope he wins it will blow the roof off the building! 😂🤦‍♂️
my guy is so punch drunk smh
I Want this transleted for portuguese
Imagine him with an audiobook lol
i love nate he is the realest mf
Man, whole lotta tough guys in the comments speaking very negatively in such a bold an confident manner about Nate lol must be salty conor fans who still can’t accept Conor got choked out
You would think with all the interviews they have done with Nate, they would know by now to turn his audio up
If Nate wins, where does this place him amongst the goats?
Pressures on you, cause I don’t give a f lol love Nate
Chimaev Just gonna try use his strength and weight and lean and lay on nate the whole fight i don't see Chimaev standing with nate the whole fight. But nate can definitely be a nightmare on the ground and submit Chimaev.
Brett comes off like he is nates therapist lol 😂 Nate will assault you bro😂
Most of his losses were in 3 round fights with close decisions. He never, ever got a rematch in any of those. And he asked for one every time. Most of the cards he fought on, were Fox or other televised cards .... not PPV. For the simple reason that the casuals would tune in and gobble up this sport, and become hard core fans who would go on to pay for the PPV. Meanwhile, Nathan would get his contracted 15-20 g's, with a bonus if he won. They (UFC) got him for cheap, and tried to keep it that way. When they were pretty much done with him and the attitude that they didn't care for, they thought they would call him up on short notice and let Connor push him out of way. That's when the casuals back then took notice and became hard core. People still don't LISTEN to what he has to say. Except for those that have understood what he is all about. All along.
Diaz ready to slap the f out chimaev.
Ha! Naaaaaate! Your a legend bro!!! He’s the champion and has the champion mindset…he doesn’t need belts or is even worried about others or what’s going on in the ufc.
Let this man retire.  He's got no brain left
Nate Diaz all the way!
Hes definitely in GOAT territory and if you listen and sift through his responses he's amazingly spot on on a fighter and business stand point.
“If you’re Mr.GOAT then make a GOAT”
“Go work on a computer somewhere You nerd” 😂😂
🐐
Douche Bag Brett 🤡
This reminded me that much of Nick/Ariel  interview but Nate was just high & Nick emotional-drunk. Interview felt personal & intimate.
bruh this guy gave us fans so much over the years always taking the toughest fights and always entertaining us its time to say thank you nate
Only 19k views (so far) yet 10k likes!  Says it all, Nate’s the man
Nate requesting to fight Francis Ngannou was lowkey hilarious
didn't expect anything but this non sense
It’s been a tough few months for some legendary OGs of the UFC  But if anyone can pull out a win even with a loss, it’s fkn Nate Diaz.
Even Nate knows he’s gonna get smeshed
did you guys film this with a Motorola razor???
He sounds like a true underdog
He's going to stop Nate Diaz he's going to beat me this and crucify him I don't think he'll fight anywhere after this c****** shot it's going to punish him and finishing
Love the respect for Penn, Fedor and the Gracie family!!!
Its true they did his brother dirty but it's become clear they're doing Nate dirty too now. Love the fighters but what a sjitty business
Nate seems very scared
The biggest legend in the Sport now there will never be another like him G.O.A.T for real!!!!
Real champion will fight anyone any time.. Diaz is taking kamzat and he does give a f… 😂😂😂👏💪
Nate is here forever. Legend !!
Gotta pop a Xanax to deal with a Nate interview. Dudes borderline illiterate and this was before his Fighting career not caused by head trauma.
If you don't have the "I'm the baddest mofo in my field" mentality, what are you doing in that field mofo? Love you Nate
Diaz is explaining, e’hem! “ nobody is tougher than you, no one is tougher than you when you, when they come around the corner, on this certain day!” Be ready! In the small grounds of fighting. I’ve backed down. And Nate to most of these fighters, never back down, even on a bad day👍🏿👍🏻☝🏿👆🏻☝🏼
Diaz bros are the goats
I love my boy Nate but I ain’t gonna lie. I need subtitles sometimes
I’m not fluent in Diaz but I know enough To understand what Nate is trying to say.
Nate is a incredible athlete win or lose. I just hope he doesn’t injure his brain with his long term fighting plan.
Nate is a legend. He needs to retire for his own good. His speech is slurring a bit. He's a legend, but I don't want to see him end up like Ali.
Gotta love Nate. The last mohican. <3
“You do steroids, I smoke weed, I don’t give a f*** let’s go” 😂
“You do steroids I smoke weed let’s get in there and squab” lmao Nate my favorite fighter
Wow we love u Nate!!!!
I'll be a Nate fan for life I hope he shocks the world.
Love watching Nate fight brings the pain every time💪🏽
At least he makes more sense than Biden.
I had a dream of nate submitting him i was saying khamzat will win but after that dream ive changed my mind
We making him fight when he can barley talk
Let’s go nate !!!!!
you think this guy is gonna run thru nate you must not know who he is Nate is one of the best fighters ufc has ever had
I hope Nate knocks him out it's going to be a good fight and I hope he makes lot of money
Is Brett a therapist now? I  don't get it
“Burns.. you fought burns dawg… SO WHAT. “Love Nate
PFP list updated. 1. Nate Diaz 1. Nick Diaz 2. BJ Penn 3. Nate Diaz 4. Fedor. 5. GSP.
The best ending to this interview... IM OUT 💯 ✌️
Diaz brothers have the biggest army in the world. Let's goooo!!!
I never ask for nothing, I demanded and I took    - Nathan Diaz.
Nate Diaz is a legend, Stockton slap coming soon boy's.  Let's GOOOOOOOOO!!!
I hope Nate pulls a W🙏
He's the most popular fighter in the U.F.C he's real he doesn't dress up in suits and think he's a movie star m.m.a won't be the same without him he's gonna shock the world khamzat never fought a guy like Nate
Nate’s Usman impression is absolute gold
“I refuse to be lame” - Nate Diaz
Nobody has but Frankie edgae
Respect. Tough fight, but rooting for nda
Brad lmao
The ssssstockton💦 sssssscraper💦
This man has CTE!
Brett okamojo
Nate is absolutely right, if the man could get his words out properly more people would understand that he is speaking facts. Nate is emotional and has every right to be. A would love for him to win then bounce. Hit the thumbs up button for Nate to win,the original gangster
Dang I feel bad for Nate, man looks like he’s just had enough
Hope Nate wins this weekend!
Nate really is a genuine person, there are no masks on him, I admire the guy for that.
“I’m willing to fight niggas on steroids Idgaf” 😭😂😂🔥🔥🔥
Been a rough ride for Diaz his face and dialect sheessh idk .. I love him always have always will
“I’ll fight all them in 5 seconds”  ~Nate Diaz
No Fear, Only Gangsta
the real OG gangster, legend!
so much anxiety. what a nerd. cannabis fks u up, stay away from drugs kids. ull end up like this drug addict.
One of the realest interviews I have watched. His body language and emotions says he is hurt by the UFC disrespecting him. He also knows they are feeding him this killer....and he knows it.
Mad respect but dude is brain dead!
Nate, all true, all insiders know.  Should be DUFC, Diaz Ultimate Fighting Championship. The brothers put the ufc over the top when it would have failed without them, marketing wise which is everything.
Boring okamoto
Diaz Army 🪖
Diaz for President! I am certain he would represent the country better than Biden, even their talking patterns are similar!
Top man
lmaooooo great interview
Nate Diaz has brought so much to the sport. True warrior he deserves much more from the UFC.
Props gotta be given to Brett, treaded subtly from the outset and allowed Nate the time to express himself how he wanted to and didn't push anything.
shout out to Brett possibly one of my favorite nate diaz interviews brett sat back as he should some interviewers would have ruined this amazing moment so props to brett 100% we love nate
Not the best spoken, of course we all know. Be we hear you Nate.. loud and clear.  And we respect and agree with you. One.
How can you not love Nate ?
Crazy respect to Nate; he knows the cards are stacked and he’s still going in swinging. Respect to the real gangster Diaz !!
I would pay to watch Nate fight anybody he fills the seats
NATE DIAZ FOREVER!!!!!
Mannn Diaz looking old
Having a belt don’t make you champ.. being a true warrior like Nate is what a real champ is! That’s why the world loves him.
Bro said Rory malcom
Say what you want Nate is 💯 truth in what he believes and says dude sounds like he’s got some demons some frustrations maybe this move away from the ufc Will take some of that away ether way he’s got the support of his friends family an the Diaz army
I would actually pay to watch these interviews! Nate was quality 👌😂
Nate diaz trolling is hilarious I’m Going to miss him . Named my son after him
Probably the most unanimously liked fighter of all time. I'm gonna miss him when he hangs em up
My head hurt
Nate Diaz: "I refuse to be lame" haha. That's basically the synopsis of this whole interview
This fight isn’t right. Nate deserves better
Is he making any sense ?!
Nate Diaz platoon mfers!
Ariel’s the best with interviews
He is one of them guys you would want to hate ,but once u get to know him u can't help to love him. Win loose or draw you have my respect.
Impossible interview
Didn’t actually realize what Nate said was true. But yeah, looking at his record, he’s been in the game the longest & fighting top 10 fighters his whole career (win or lose he’s still fighting the best) - and still taking on a top 5 in Chimaev. Respekt.
Nate is just a badass man. The diaz brothers are so iconic.
At the end of this interview he sums up what it would be like to Defend The Belt Once Champion… Fighting Best Of The Best  but can’t come to realize that’s what it’s all bout… Throne Status, Nate Needs The Title Shot If he can defeat Chimaev !
Nate is my favorite person in combat sports, period,  what a legend he is, Nick too ofc, I truly hope Nate finds success once he's out the UFC! 👊😎
Mad respect to him my man knows the real business Always loved him for being him <3
As real as it gets
The next 15 years??? 😂🤣😂 I love this dude.
This was a great interview I have to go. Now that’s how you do it
Brilliant fighter but behind the hard man act this guy is insecure.
Nate said he’s the goat but he was dominated by Masvidal and was dominated by benson , and RDA , if you can’t beat those guys you’re most definitely not the goat
I may be wrong and Nate feels different when he's on tv doing interview etc, but I think he is ALWAYS SO REAL, ALWAYS so normal, always so Nate! He such a Real boy! This man, is a Real OG just being Himself
You have been inspiring and entertaining people for so long and always stayed true to yourself. No belt needed at all. You're a purist and an idealist. We need that more in a world full of artificial BS. I only have respect and love for you man♥️💪
Nigganuo. 🗿😭🤣
If Nate could put his words together, people would understand what truth is behind his experiences.
Diaz vs Edwards that's what this Guy deserve .
Brett okamato sucks. Can’t we get someone else?
Ufc is making a mistake letting this guy go
He looks like chuck Liddell here
The Stockton super hero
"Great interview, Brett. I gotta go." 😆
Props to Nate,,, he has done a lot for the sport,, HAT to you Nate,, hope you win Saturday Nt,, 🏆 👍🏻
The Realest fighter ever. Win Draw Lose (or sabotage😉) , Nate is the Best fighter.  I really want him to go out there and tap in the middle of the octagon just when the fight starts. Just imagine
I was excited for this fight until watching this interview. The UFC should have just paid Nate for his last fight and released him. This man is in no shape to absorb more trauma.
Nate is hurting Chimayav win or lose. He will rock chimayav and chimayav will be afraid at one point. And I love my crazy Swed Chimayav
Nate your the realest gangsta
I'd always love Nate diaz..
The predator Francis "Niganu"  😂
I want Nate to spoil the party 🎉 at UFC 279  I hope he spoils everyones hope  in 4th 5th rounds and wins.  Love from Indian 🇮🇳 for Nate
Nate! Let's go Dawg! You d G!
Big fan of yours..Awesome interview  really nate n nick diaz is the real fighter...respect n love...Diaz Army
Hoping he has his brother nick in his corner the love they have for each other is hard matched and Nick knowing him more than anyone and would be a plus to have for sure!
Imagine having a sesh with Nate and  accidentally spilling the bud because you can't handle your weed🥋👊🌱🐲
Hands down one of the greatest comment sections ever. Mad respect for Nate.
Woof woof. Ruff ruff! I'd bite dudes neck out if I was Nate, and spit the Adam's apple at the suits
How is the audio so trash
BOOOO "what???" dink.
If nate beats khamzat he should get a title fight against leon
Nate is hilarious
Love Nate but there was a lot of nonsense in this. Maybe it’s a good thing this is his last fight in the UFC.
Audio engineer should be fired
The real BMF
I’m with Nate. Putting money on him don’t care if he wins or loses.
He’s right.
Imagine seeing Nate choke out Khamzat .. what a G
Saying Leon is the easiest fight he had, dissing usman , I mean come on, As much as what he saying about the politics of ufc , He’s become delusional also
I hope he comes out alive .. you can see the damage done already and I don't see. Khamzat having mercy.  I don't like this fight I don't think its  right. This young guy is too fresh too much of a savage. And I think Nate feels the same in the way he's talking like they forced him into it
I love him!
This dude gives me hella Vlad TV vibes
I wish he understood business better. I get the warrior philosophy part but he’s missing the business acumen and gets mad when it’s not just warrior culture
I think Diaz need more than five rounds no limites with this Guy a true warrior!
G’d up from my feet up
Wouw I didn't know this man is REAL 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Nate vs the machine
Legend
god ic ant stand when brett just says "mhm mhm" how does this guy still work for espn lmao honestly
Your welcome Dubai 😂
Nate’s a real one
Man I really hope big Nate pulls this off bro 👏 let’s go !!!! Stockton stand up and USA 🇺🇸 stand up for NATE DIAZ
If you’re mr Goat then make a goat
Nate is the all time goat of the world.
Brett has gotten way worse at his job
He looks tired , hope he will be OK all the best mate
I'm not surprised.
Video quality is not great…
“You fought burns dog”
The 'realest motherfucker in the game.
Nate values himself much more than others value Nate!  A legend in his own mind, narcissistic pot brain.  So Nate is taking this fight to be released by the UFC?  Says he didn’t want this fight?  He better be ready, because he is facing a savage!
Nate via submission first round can you mark my words?
This dude got pounded on so much he can’t hardly speak English anymore
I am reallly sorry to say it but Nate ll loss badly he ll be knocked out badly by Khamzat , kHamzat is different level fighter
The Diaz Brothers are true Legends!!!
National Treasure
Nate's impression of Gilbert 😂
We love u nate
I gotta go 😂
Man when he starts getting comfortable he gives great conversation  👏👏
I laughed so loud when he said he wants to fight Adesanya and Ngannou. Much respect to Nate Diaz.
he's under marijuana during interview?
STOCKTON MOFO 💯🖕.  HOPE HE SLEEPS KUMSHOT 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Nate diaz is like adrian broner he did it for the hood THE WHOLE HOOD😭 love Nate hard not to
Did you just smoke what are you talking about man that's why I told my ex to quit smoking her brain is full of bong water
We will be always with you Nate diaz. Respect.
Nates always been fun to watch in the octagon, but is equally entertaining to watch in his interviews. But to be completely honest, Im glad this is his last fight only because I feel that if he takes too many more punches to the dome, he may not come back from it.
everyone thinks this fight will make Khamzat great, but this fight isn't about Khamzat! it will make Nate even bigger than he already is!!! this man is a legend...
Man Nate really speaking facts, the younger generation of fighters needs to listen to this message. Don't get caught up in chasing the belt, if its what you want to do then go for it. Just stay true to yourself, don't let the media or the UFC push you into situations you don't wanna be in. Nate is his own champion, he is proud of everything him and Nick accomplished. They did it THIER WAY, stood up for what they believed them and didn't let the money or fame change them.  Two badass mfs that changed the game!
Would love to meet Nate Diaz ! Respect from Cape Town , South Africa !  Love the fact you wear your glasses at the back of the head like me Nate !! Respect to all you do in the fighting industry!
im the champion of the whole ufc and ion give af
Hope you win Nate, I REALLY HOPE YOU WIN!!!!
I’m convinced that if Nate loses the fight his stock will not drop. If Chimaev doesn’t kill him or gets wobbled/dropped his stick will drop.   Nate built this. No fighter like him.
Was this a real interview or a session between Nate and his psychiatrist.... Im confused.
Nate and nick are different level
Awesome interview just amazing Nate is the goat
This interview got me even more excited. Lol 😂
*I think Nathan might have a little CTE.*
How can you not cheer for this guy?! Warrior, G, legend.
I don’t idolize any celebrities but Nate Diaz is as close as u can get to that for me. This dude helped me so much in my life I hope he realizes how many people he has inspired
Nate dont like to be a puppet! Good for him ! The ufc dose push certain fighters ! His brother is a legend!!@ so is nate !
What he said is true Usman and khamzat ain't fought anyone and they just wrestle. Nate has longevity.
Nate is the heart and soul of MMA...
NICK & NATE DIAZ  GOATS 💯💯💯💯💯💯
Does nate not look like Tuco from Breaking bad to anyone else? It's like Tuco Salamanca with Mike Tyson's voice at the same time.
Loved Nate’s Usman impression. 😂🤣😂
“Im the champion of the whole UFC” get em Nate Dog
Nate where all on your side here and pray you get this because you deserve it brother and give the UFC a Big 🖕after you win!
Great interview
Don't care what people say he will always be the people's champion period
Nate is as real as they come❤️
Pull that  one out and you will be the goat of all time for a long long time
😂😂😂😂😂 he number 2 gtfo
I feel Nate gonna get the W somehow
Nick Diaz army motherfuckers
fedor millenko
NATE DIAZ is the Shawn Porter of the UFC
Nate the main man for sure 🤘
Wow great quality ESPN
Nick and Nate Diaz will always be MMA legends.  It will be a sad day for MMA fans when they leave the spot.  Much respect Nate.  I'm not gonna lie, I shed a tear watching this interview.   One thing about Nate.....he's  NEVER changed in all these years.  Can't say that bout 99% of these fighters.  I'm a big fan of Khamzat but...mannnn I have so much respect for Nate
This guys is just tired of everything, I can tell he wants to show up and show out
If Nate gets a win, submission... My God... Internet is going to break...
Nate army? like stoners on a couch? yeah not scary🤣 also whats this real  "gangster" thing?  i mean gangster means a member of a criminal gang is it not? so this guys is a criminal? what is a fake gangster? someone who pretends to be comminiting crimes with his gang? 🤣 real gangster never publicly calls himself a gangster
Nate Diaz ain't a yes man. He a real one
But low key it hurts him to not have held a belt
Diaz brothers are absolute legends and fan favorites. Peoples champions.
This is the best interview I can remember seeing that gives us a little more insight into Nate.
He's retiring, I can see it in his eyes. He'll go box YTers for 3x the money, sad times were in.
He’ll always be my favorite fighter just because of the spectacle that comes along with him. You just never know what you’re gonna get.
nate is actually delusional
" i'm the Champion of the whole UFC all together " 🤣🏆Nate sounding like Charlie Zelenoff now
It feels to me that he didn’t get to train properly again because some injury or whatever. It’s that energy he gives off on his interviews. He just knows his not in his best shape. Love Nate tho. Big fan
he's high kkkk goat
WAR DIAZ SUBMITION 2ND ROUND
Nate the GREAT
And in his brain it’s an up-and-comer fighting Against a pure legend which is so absolute truth and he feels like everyone is feeding him to the Lions I hope Nate busts this guy up!!!!!!!!!!! Go Diaz
Long live Nate!
This interview would have been better if it was done by Ariel…..
Dude sounds incoherent, his stream-of-consciousness rambles rival those of James Joyce.
This guy is all heart. Impossible to hate him. He is right, the UFC has not been fair to him.
Not me Nate I’m rooting for it it’s Nate Diaz army motherfuckers
Can’t not like this dude.
his usman impression was on point lmao
Some of the best quotes in an interview. Nate talking about Kamaru claiming he's the goat. " Well if you're a goat, make a goat". Lol
John 3:16
Badass
nate is the man
Aw dude. I hope he doesn't sign with the UFC again.
The ufc really missed the boat with Nate. He is still as popular as anyone in the sport and the emotion and truth in this interview shows what should of been tapped into years ago! How was UFC 209 not in Stockton with Nate headlining?
Love this dude but hes taking way 2many head shots n the weed dont help either,love 2c him win tho🙏✌
He looks like Nick more and more.. Diaz bros forever
Im team Nate Diaz but this is delusional.
Nate Diaz = CTE
Great entertainment. But last 20 fights only 3-4 top fights. Maybe just one Mcgreggor
Much Love&Respect to the Diaz Brothers Always🙏. ABSOLUTE LEGENDS👊👊
Chimaev wasn’t AT ALL well prepared for Burns. I can see him easily winning Díaz, but I think a lot of people are underestimating Nate and he’s a bombshell, he’s old, but if he can still throw some punches I think he might stand a little chance.   I absolutely adore the Diaz brothers , some of the best guys ever in the history of the sport, I feel like this is Dana’s revenge on Nate, but… What if he gets Chimaev like Leon got Kamaru? In this sport you never know ,and if that happens I think White it’s gonna be extremely ANGRY. Nate is not a dude to play around and he’s definitely not a guy who will surrender, he’s never done that. Khamzat wasn’t as good as I was expecting when he fought Burns, so let’s see…
I would like to see him leave get some big payday fights there’s really nothing left to prove he’s unique in the sense that his fighting spirit makes him bigger than winning and losing.
Pop off Nate 🔥
KHAMZAT WILL DESTROY HIM
Put some respect on charles name nate dude will eat you up
Consequential champion.
there are videos of interview with hardcore/homeless drug addicts in youtube that looked or sounded just like this interview. no offence, just stating facts.. say no to marijuana, ganja, weed, whatever u call it.
What is his point?  That the ufc is holding him to a contract?
This interview reminds me of interviews with serial killers. It has a quiet, awkward tone.
This Interview is Heartbreaking.
'This fight isn't about this guy, it's about making this guy.'
He's been hit to many times.
dude sounding like freddy roach at this point
He beat Leon in my opinion
Nate is a killer. Almost TKO'd Leon Edwards, choked out Conor handing him his first loss in the UFC when Conor was on top. The realest of the real, the UFC loses a real mixed martial artist when Nate is finished.
good luck Nate Diaz..legend
So why khamzat?  Adam Sandler Robert Di Niro Al pacing fedor the gracies🤣🤣
If Diaz finishes Khamzat I'll scream even louder than I did when Leon head kicked Usman :D
This interview was all about his mindset"kill or be killed". one of the rare interview i watched till the end.
This is what it’s like when you interview a crack head 😅😅😅gotta love him tho hope he wins
"This was a great interview, Brett... I have to go."  Dude.  Every single interview Nate does is an absolute hitter it's incredible.
Lol after getting punched in the head thousands of times and smoking 24/7, Diaz still has a better memory than Brett
Not all of us are saying that Nate!!! Some of us are still in your corner brother🤘🤘
gonna miss Nate when he's gone and the UFC did him dirty with this fight cause khamzat is gonna seriously hurt him
Andrew Tate needs to do a podcast with Nate,both real G talking facts.
LMAO at the Kamaru shade. Love this dude's MMA math
Man oh man... this guy just put straight up facts and made so much sense 💀🤫 i never thought of things he just mentioned and i now really feel manupilated by UFC's marketing team.
Nate talks so bad even my closed captions are waaaaaay off🤦🏽he could honestly never be the same after this fight. So sad. BJ Penn is translated into Br Japan🤦🏽🤣
Nate is a legend bro. hes got this
Nate follows the warrior code ! About that life! Respect to stockton and norther cali. Win or lose nate is a true warrior!
Diaz MotherFucking Army 💪🏼
It’s so obvious that he hates doing these interviews 😂  Nate is gonna be missed, great memories, amazing moments, it’s gonna feel different without him being in the UFC, it’s sad fr….Donald just retired, Rockold just retired, and now this is Nate’s last fight with the UFC….we are transitioning into a new era of MMA and though it’s exciting, it’s sad at the same time….
Diaz MotherFucking Army 💪🏼
To be honest I love nate but it sounds like he’s accepted the fact that he’s going to lose but wants to let u know he’s one of greats
Let's go Nate!  Diaz army, pull up! 💪
Legacy is all about integrity winning or losing either Nate Diaz is the greatest fighter.
Who gets higher before an interview then this guy 😂😂
turn up the volume next time please
Nate is the goat man. Champion of the whole UFC. He is himself and truly gives no shits
Nate Diaz is gonna beat chimaev by submission. Then Nate Diaz is gonna have a huge professional boxing match against Oscar De La Hoya on Triller. I said it first.
khamzat going to kill nate badly
This interview bro! Lol 😂
For the record. I haven’t said khamzat is stomping out Diaz. Since they scheduled this fight, ive said in at least 100 different places, don’t be surprised when diaz sinks that choke mfers.
please quit letting Bret do these interviews. Jesus Christ.
Nate has fought the top that's for sure...
And this is why WE ALL LOVE NATE 🙌🏼
I love the fact that Nate fights all the top guys and isn’t worried about his record. He’s legit and always has been.  Sadly he sounds like he may have CTE.  I know his speech has never been super clear but he seems a bit punchy.  It’s sad how these guys give everything they have for relatively small money and in the end most will end up with serious health problems
Lol he just admitted that he gonna loose.
"I am the greatest fighter to ever step into the UFC octagon" lmao
brett is so boring we need ariel doing these
Love Nate. No belt never change the fact that dude is a beast. Legendary ufc fighter who will go down in history.
The combination of being punched in the head and all the dope has left this guy a blabbering brain-damaged tool.
Nate just said the ufc is fixed without saying the ufc is fixed..
I hope Nate shocks the world!!
Goat!
OG Nathan Donald Diaz, Keepin it Gangsta!
I think Nate dont see love from the fans and respect from fighters and UFC.
need the uncut version of this
Lests go Diaz from Brazil
Genius. Nate lost to the champ and the number 1 guy. He's still number 2.
It's gonna be sad when he retires
As much as a legend he is, you can see the effects of fighting this long and all these wars he’s had. He’s a Big candidate for CTE.   He says things that make sense, but just rambles on about nothing also.  I think it’s good this is his last fight in the UFC. He Needs to stop
Watch what happens when Khamzat starts to gas then gets slapped by Nate its gonna be wild
I love how much respect he has for the Gracie's! Hoping he can pull off an upset but it's going to be dicey.
Cant remember a UFC fight where I have been genuinely nervous for one of the fighters involved. Nate’s a legend but takes ALOT of damage in his fights. Hope he makes it out of this in one piece and can enjoy his post-ufc life. I will absolutely lose it if he gets it done. What a legendary moment that will be
What was the question?
more power 2 u Nate
So much respect for Nate and Nick always did it their own way absolutely legends in the sport for sure!!!!!!
Boy punch drunk
Love Nate,but after watching this he needs no more punch's to his head 🙏
Get this guy out of here. He doesn’t appreciate anything.
wow. this had me going through more than any 2 hr movie. amazing.
Feel sorry for this guy
Hahaha, booo “what?, bang” that’s why he is entertaining. This fight will be action, get a double beer hat or a straw to your keg so you don’t miss any of it.
What a man. Absolute legend of the fight game! A true warrior!! Hope he shocks the world this weekend!
Win or lose nothing will change Nate is the real champion as far as I am concerned
Why’s the quality so bad ??
"you shoulda worked on some computer somewhere you nerd!"  - Nate Diaz 2022
I really hope Nate somehow pulls off the win. Go Nate
You have this nate
Was going to listen to this but can't stand this Brett clown.  Soon as I heard his voice paused it to write this comment
Nate made me a fan of mma his season of TUF. Champions come and go, but legends live on forever. Nate is a legend
I see that cut on his eye>> He's gonna get bloodied again>> Khamzat is gonna try to finish Nate on the 1st round, and Nate gonna catch him & knock him out>>
Legendary warrior - win or lose - he's the REAL DEAL !!!!
Nate rolls on r.3.+.@.r.d. pride.. just dumb lol
209 Legend in the game.
Is he high?
“You should’ve worked on a computer or something, you need.” - Nate. I hope nate wins.
The random tangents & thinking-out-load just adds to this.  We're gonna miss Nathan when he's gone.
WAR DIAZ!!!!
All i ask is one good Stockton Slap 'for good measure' - Anik voice
Okomata is the worst MMA journalist in history.
Why censor? It's on YouTube ESPN. And this is a fight
720p, espn? really?
209 Loves You Nate!!!
Brain dead…he couldn’t find the door in a phone box….or the phone!
It's sad that this isn't CTE. Nate has always been this way.
"I refuse to be lame" beautiful.
Dood lost every round against Leon then says he basically beat him lol. Clown shyt.
That was awesome, fk i love nate!
Yikes! He said it... He didn't and doesn't want this fight. I'm low-key kinda scared for him now. And F Dana White!
Nate DIaz. An absolute legend.
Wait.. he wanted Ngannou?
When you love the human and the heart and character laid out at your feet this man never loses even in defeat, he brings it everytime for everyone and the pressure he puts on himself is clear as day... Definitely alot of log files was recalled and rearranged in Nate's timeline of his time at this game in this interview, and saw his brother play the game before he began also, love to see him offload here, not a common occurrence mind you, but you can see the honesty of the journey in his mind of his own walk and how the new timeline guys fighting just 4 to 8 times and main evented or belt chance and these veterans have double digit fights over a decade, win lose or draw, a fights a fight to these men, always been that way, a battle of wills on any given evening, belts secondary, honour in the game and sport first, and the company rode the back clean off these boys too...
Let's go Nate Diaz! He's gonna do it... I liked his kumaru impersonation. Lol Kumaru cool J.
Was a time Nate would just annoy me (mostly cuz of his delusional fans) but it is foolish to view it that way, wish him the best of luck and would be incredible if something unexpected happens
Should've worked on a computer somewere u nerd"  NATE DIAZ ,
My fav UFC fighter of all time
Does he think he beat Leon? Lol
I said it before. Ill say it again.  Nate has fought the fighters   that are most avoided,   masvidal avoids these fighters
No matter what Nate will be my favorite fighter of all times next to Fedor.
Who are they talking about when Nate says they’re saying I’m gonna get walked over, when Brett says the fighter they’re talking about says he’s been a fan and watching him. And Nate says f that he just saying that cause he has to. I thought they were talking in general but which one Brett talking about?
Never been the biggest Nate fan but im pulling for him so badly in this bout
I just love the way he always finishes all of his interviews whether it's with Ariel or Brett. I seen your face for too long now go be a dork somewhere else(respectfully)
Let’s goo Natan! Huge Respect! He’s legend and GOAT of MMA! F All!
He was true on that Jon Jones thing
When he says if you take steroids you can't be considered a goat, it's so true. Of course  many guys  take stuff and were never caught but if you do take anything your legacy should be done.
I still have Homeboys at home that are harder than any champion. - Nate Diaz
love Nathan love Nick dosen't get more real, savages but super cool
Its hard to understand him. Did he always speak this way?
Nate knows when he fought his own fights Brett. He fought Cowboy on UFC 141. Lesnar vs Overeem.
I like how he says it's him vs. everyone. I'd be willing to bet the entire stadium will be cheering for him to win. He will have everyone supporting him except Chimaev and the UFC
Why Diaz face is getting to Gilbert Burns?
"You do steroids and I'll smoke weed and then we can get in there" lmao nate doesn't care that one of those things gives a significant advantage and the other doesnt
" I still got home boys at home harder than any champion " - Nate Diaz   That's why there is a Diaz army ( respect ).
You have given us more than we deserve nate your a true G.
If you close your eyes it sounds like an 88 year old man is getting interviewed.
Reporter: good morning nate how are you Nate: proceeds to rant about the UFC for 20 minutes
Diaz brothers for life
Epic as always, TEAM DIAZ ALL THE WAY, the realest
Much respect to Nate Diaz, I'm rooting for him too.
The GOAT
Ja ja ja ja Nate Diaz you did the right thing on the end you let know you are the f****** boss
Lets give Nate the send off he deserves and break records buying the pay per view
"This was a great interview, I gotta go."  LEGEND
Khamzat should be fighting Covington
This is what weed and CTE does to you. He's gonna be Joe Biden by 45
Nate Diaz has the meanest overbite
The last time Nate Diaz was favored in a fight, was the last time he was finished. 9 in a row as the underdog and won 4 of them.
Nate🐐🐐🐐
I still got homeboys at home that are harder than any champion!!! 💪🏽
Warrior
Retirement fight, thank god.
Nate's so real he brings a tear to my eye. He speaks so true to his heart it becomes facts to the rest of the world 👊💢💯❤️ I can't help but Root for him to get it done ✅ If there is a WILL there is a way !!! Let's go Gangster!!!
That Usman impersonation was hilarious 😭😭😭
I’m just thankful he beat that angry little Irish twerp TWICE!!!
Nate Diaz (and Nick) should deserve more respect & the UFC should compensate Nate in someway...
I don’t like this interviewer …. They way he is sitting … like 🤦🤦‍♂️
Dana White said that Nate asked for the Khamzat fight. I just heard Nate say that he didn't want this fight and still doesn't want this fight. I really hope Nate follows through and starts his own promotion once he retires, so he can protect fighters from what tha UFC and USADA did to him and his brother. In my opinion, they both single handedly ruined Nick's career.
Nigganou🤣🤣🤣20:00
What if… WHAT IF Nate just kneels down and taps, calls out Jake Paul immediately who’s in the crowd and they both flip off Dana?
Fenster. From The Usual Suspects. Nate Diaz is the MAN!
Should of worked on a computer somewhere nerd lol
Bret actually listened for once lol
Nate has the maniërisms of an older man, he seems wise. Like a monk
This reminds me so much of Nick’s last interview. You can tell the UFC really cornered Nate into this fight and dont have his best interest in mind whatsoever. But Nate dgaf hes gonna still go out there step up to the plate.
See these noobs have no respect for Penn and it sickens me! Been Penn army since 04 if there’s a Mt Rushmore for ifc he’s on it! Will always be my fav!!!
I do not have any idea what he was talking about for the whole interview, but I love him.
This is what happens you smoke everyday. Everyday feels like it was just the other day
17:20 For Nate's hilarious Khamzat impression
is he high ?
Love Nate but this fool hasn't won a fight since 2019 and he's the "champion of the whole UFC?" 😂
Legend
Crème De La Creme. Lmfao 😂 Let’s go Nathan!!!!!
Nate always opens up 20 min into the interview in all his interviews he’s done. He never feels comfortable at the beginning but then gives great interviews after that. Nate said it best He better finish me and Khamzat only real name fight was with Burns who he couldn’t finish Burns, If Khamazat gases out then Nate submits him just like Connor fight. Ufc messed up not making Dustin vs Nate , Nate vs Connor 3 or rematch of BMF Fight. Nate will beat Khamzat Saturday nite. To much pressure is on Khamzat to get job done.
Who? 😂 20:02
Sad to see Nate's transformation into maturity it's all because of puf
5:33 Adam Sandler ... LOOOOOOOOOOOOL
That CTE noticeable
Not resigning Nate will be the biggest L the UFC has ever taken.
Nate said he would fight Ngannou 20:00  ...stop the cap🤣
LETS GOOOO NATE!!!! STOCKTON 2️⃣0️⃣9️⃣  🏆🥇🏆
All you Nate Diaz fans have more CTE than he does , what was this interview even about lol ? Dude sitting here talking about he’s the best fighter in the ufc and going on about how he beat Leon Edwards , he’s a 170 pounder calling out all the 155 😂😂 talking about Ferguson, Dustin what a clown
Nate knows he’s in for it.. he needs to survive the first 3 and turn it on in rounds 4 and 5 and go for the finish.. he has more gas than khamzat and experience
Brett… worst interviewer ever!!!!! Ariel is so much better than him
Nate Diaz leaving his gloves in the octagon will make grown men cry
Brett :  Jon Jones? Nate :  Who?  (Picogrammmm).
Brain damage.
4K CONTENT.
This is your fight Nate shut them down
Say no to drugs! No matter what Nate Diaz needs to retire! Dana White this supposed to be a interview not a behavioral health psychological counseling session.  He already lost!
Diaz Army All Day🇲🇽
6:52 Nate rubs his chin with his index finger causing a pretty deep cut over his right eye.
CTE is sad to watch
Gangsta.   This really opened my eyes to what's going on behind the scenes
Impossible not to love this guy. :)
He is way past his fighting peak.  Way too much dope smoked.  He’s going to get crushed.  I like him.  But he’s gonna get smoked.  I hope he’s not seriously hurt.
"To all the fighters and the media who's saying he's the biggest best thing, where's the facts? He fought Burns dawg, he fought Burns! Whatever!" Nate, the Ultimate Fighting Champion
"You do steroids' and I smoke weed and lets get in there and fight" - Nick Diaz 2022
I love how he took over the interview... i remember watching nate back one time after he won he said give me my mfing flip flops 😭😭😭 i was instantly a fan i forget who it was he fought but priceless
“I didn’t call for him,I didn’t want him, I never asked for him” nate on chimaev Yet Dana tries to tell us all that this is the fight nate wanted👀 nate just wants out of his contract and this was the only way he could escape
Nate either doing some hard drugs or he took too many blows to the head. He not sounding right. Didn’t answer any questions just went to a rant. That’s not weed, he can’t sit still. That heroin my friend
It would have been a great interview if it weren’t for all the ads 👎🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼🖕🏼
i have a strange feeling Nate is gonna give chimaev a much harder time than most people think.
Love Nate Diaz his brain is three steps ahead of his mouth and he is absolutely one of the top fighters ever in the UFC no questions asked that man draws people like it's nothing his brother same thing definitely a total army behind that kid and I'm telling you now don't bet against Nate Diaz this could be one of the biggest upsets in UFC history right here all it takes is one slip.
WOW! A Diaz Interview? This Should Be Well Spoken and Intelligent. LOL! Not That It Matters, RETARDS Love The Diaz Girls. They Speak The FAKE Language Of The WANNABE Man. LOL!
I'm nor surprised nates going to win motherfucker
I want Nate to win this fight so $&@8 bad!!! Just a $&@& you to Dana White.
Always new I liked Nate now I like him even more. Was able to see through the BS UFC did they keep trying to use him as a stepping stone. Easily the realest MMA fighters and I wish him the best appreciate the entertainment you’ve given to us!!!
24:13 Facts!! Jon Jones is out of the question
Nate's always been the realest. They're never be another fighter like him nor Nick ever again
“I almost beat up Dana white” -Nate 😂
Why does espn have poor quality video?
Respect. Legend.
P.S. Shock the world. Again.
This is for Jon Jones delusional fan base 😂 LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY ! Nate Diaz has a very special message for you 👉 24:11
Imagine Nate getting the W somehow and fighting Leon for the title😱
As much as he rambles and seems to make no sense at times, he makes some intelligent points. This was one of the best interviews ever.
Nate is way too high.
Nate Diaz army!! Realist mother F@@ka in the FIGHT GAME!!!
It’s crazy that it ended up like this. Nate feeling like it’s him vs the world. I know everyone says “they love Nate Diaz regardless” but people will be on Twitter and YouTube making memes and jokes and talking crazy when he’s in there. It’s sad.
This mans a real G, Legend forever 🧙‍♂️
It's so funny listening to him talk, he knows so much but has a hard time saying it😂😂 love this dude
When Nate starts to talk and you're drawn into the whole movie…he makes you see it from behind his own eyes. And you know somehow he’s right. Fighters like pawns, you better stand for your own ways or either you'll be crafted by the company's hands.
The things we do for money!
10 minutes in and i have no idea whats going on
The most delusional fighter I’ve ever seen haha
He is delusional is what he is.
Nate actually believes this stuff… lol he’s a great fighter and legend but come on
Trust me Americans will recognize ROBERT DE’NIRO IDK ABOUT ROYCE GRACIE
Should have never made this a fight for Nates sake but if he wants it he wants it.
Comparing BJ Penn to Pacino is Penns greatest achievement 😂
"I'm the best fighter to ever be in the ufc ever, besides my brother"
This guy is not in shape. I see lack of discipline. I really don’t want him to lose
You just can’t sensor Nate. He should add no censorship clause in his new contract 😂
Nate is gonna win. I don’t know how. But he’s gonna win. Leg kicks are gonna be the key.
How is ESPN putting out YouTube videos at horrible video quality?
The true Top G
Do what you do best, go to war, drag him in to deep water then turn up the heat!
make it fookin louder already espn, zokamoto or whoever
Awkward interview as usual, it’s funny that foreigners make fun of the Diaz brothers and how they don’t speak English
Lots of respect to Nate, he a real one, but that brain’s fried brah
nate diaz is the people's goat and that's what only matters
Any time anywhere. The Diaz brothers embody the spirit of the Fight. They'll always be the goats.
i think nate might literally die hes like 70 years old
“I’m the champion of the whole UFC. And I don’t Give AF”!
2 pac of the ufc And of mma
I really hope nate shocks us all....
War
This interviewer is terrible...
I got a headache after watching this
Nate is gonna get knocked out. I hate to say it. I hope he will be ok
love nate but hes going to get destroyed. his brothers last fight was sad to watch as well.
They pretending like this is the fight I wanted. I asked for 20 other fights, but they wouldn't give them to me.
he's like I gotta go , great therapy session lol
Truth is I ain't watched UFC in many years but I'm watching this fight don't count Nate out if he's showing up there's gonna be a fight
🦘💪
Diaz Army 🇲🇽🇺🇸💯💰
War Diaz
"im my own champion" this why I love this dude
Game is gonna miss this Legend
WAR DIAZ.
The end : this was great interview 😂 Nate it's crazy guy lol 😂
What is Nate talking about?
I love nate, one of the legends of the ufc. Even though everyone counts him out, I'm still rooting for him over that Russian. Even if he doesn't pull it off, I'm sure he will go on to make millions in his career elsewhere. All of that being said, it's really sad to see him like this compared to old nate Diaz... It just seems like the company sucked everything out of him
No one’s seeing how much brain damage he clearly has here, you’re just cheering him because you only care for the man when he’s bleeding for you.
This is just sad to watch
CTE
You  have my respect Nate.  It's time to get focused Daniel Son.
Wow! Best interview with Nate in a long time. He's right on being frustrated. "Go make this guy with your last fight". Man I'm hoping for an upset. If Nate wins I'm gonna go nuts. Most realest dude in MMA.
Always had a soft spot for Nate. Chimaev is a beast but if anyone can upset a favourite it'll be Nate.
I'm the champion of the whole UFC. - Nate Diaz
14:25 thank you Nate! You’re top dog! 🥇
Nate by rear naked choke round 3!!!!!, that man is gonna make a mistake and nate will be there !! Let's go nate!!!!
Not "if" you beat him....it's WHEN you beat him Nate!!
Diaz Boyz are the realist ones in the UFC PERIOD!!! Love these Guys Going to be sad when they are retired from fighting  Always will be #1 in my Book Stay Tru and stay you
he straight up says it feels like its me vs the whole ufc
23:56 Nate: im willing to fight a n-word on steroids.
Gave Thomson respect lol
This man has my upmost respect man. His mentality is great you can tell he’s always thinking bro ppl think he is dumb I disagree he’s just been through a lot
nate fought conor, pettis,masvidal,leon from 2016. lost 13 matches and won 21 matches. somehow he is a big star
Shout out to ninja Rua.
Best Interview ever
Respect Nate love the Diaz Bros Stay Safe this Fight........you are the CHAMP End of.
In short he has crowned himself champion along time ago, as long as he fought the best , beat the best and did it with style he was a champion , a belt doesn’t define him hard work and beating the best makes you a champion .. That’s how Nate’s sees it …Hands down …That’s why I love and Respect him  .. I wish he knew the respect and admiration he has in this world ❤️❤️❤️💪🏾💪🏾🤞🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾Diaz Army 4 ever…Go Nate Dogg We got your Back Playboy.. Now go put this clown in his Place..🤡🤡🤡
Win, lose, or draw, Nate has the respect for fighting the toughest dudes. People like to point out his record, but I respect those losses more than a clean streak record of easy fights.
Nate is the OG ultimate fighter and our champion.
I’m routing for Nate Diaz
It’s so hard to watch his interviews imo
Wonder if Dana is still gona push the narrative that nate wanted khamzat and this isn’t all about making khamzat even more famous. It was shitty of Dana to mock leon Edwards and dan hardy for saying it how it is. Come on nate💪 mess UFC’s plans up
Is it me or it this interview sounds like a goodbye
The love and respect I'm reading in these comments is awesome.
Dana missed out big time on making Tony vs Nate. You got Tony wanting to fight at 170 while Nate fighting out his contract. Both guys active at the same time too? Pshh. Sure it would be as big if not bigger that this one, but the anticipation and actually not knowing who might win adds to the sell of the fight.
In Nates corner will be Nick with a shotgun....
There is really only one nate diaz, the champ of no one tells me who to fight, coasted vs Leon to spiderman point him and FU. 😂
There are two fighters where I can watch lengthy interviews and still come away having no idea what they said, Tony Ferguson is the other. Still hope he wins though, underrated guy.
Funny  how he never mentioned GSP in the goats list 🤔😂
Great interview. Brett asked simple questions and just let Nate be Nate. It's crazy how he comes off (at first) as confused, but I feel it's just him translating his complex thoughts/emotions to words, but once he gets going you feel him, he becomes easy to understand, he's as real as it gets. Love Nate. Do the same thing homie!
28:13 real
Stockton stand up
With all, do respect, Nate. Thats how the UFC works when you come up, Connor was the man, and you made your name and money because of him.
This guy clearly lost his mind thanks to cannabis.  He doesn't even make sense half the times
Love nate but god dam i can never understand half the stuff hes on bout 🤣🤣
I want Nate to win so badly.
Nate’s losing by doctor stoppage
Legend - would love Khamzat to take him down, get caught in a triangle & Nate celebrate before the tap 🙏
Nick Diaz Army 👊🏽👊🏽👊🏽 LA Raza esta contigo.... he's about to surprise the world 🌎 all over again,  and walk TF out with a mic 🎤 Drop ✌🏽🤷🏾‍♂️🍺🍺
Rory Marco is retired.
Nate has been disrespected for years. He should have been a long running champion for many years. And to all those writing nate off in this fight where have you been. Nate is a real all round fighter and will shock you all again.  Nate will keep shocking the ufc and the world until they give him the respect he deserves.
Gotta love Nate. Let's go!
The way this Stockton G is reminiscing about the past is cause for concern. Nate has provided us with the most memorable performances in a cage. But, none of that matters on Saturday.
He’s too old now
Like watching a man waiting to go to his execution
I really want Nate to shock the world and get a HUGE offer to come back to the UFC!
His best interview, cant wait. He is fired up!
Diaz is live in this fight. If Khamzat keeps it standing he's in trouble especially round 4 onward.
The west coast zombie 💪with Stockton 👋
Everytime Nate say uuhhh I think his going to pass out
Imagine what he was like before the lobotomy!
Nick Diaz is the LITERAL "fighting" goat, fk da rules, no one could truly "beat" Nick in a REAL FIGHT... much love to Nate as well, u can tell he learned from.... the greatest TEUE fighter of all time
The big Dawg... big Nate !!!!
Love nate leave the weed for this fight your win keep smoking 100 percent hold the L love too see another conner moment if he wins put another  pic .i am not surpised on wall in camden london
This has it all! Best interview he’s ever done, how can you not at the very least respect Nate!
Whoever took the decision to censor a Diaz interview was wrong. (-;
I love nate man without a doubt he's my favorite fighter in the UFC its hard watch this knowing it could be his last fight it also sucks seeing him be done this way by the UFC but that's how the businessgoes rite, seems like a real laid back chill dude, hope he finds a way to win man Diaz Army💪 Let's Go
Nate Is Very High Than Khamzat You Can't Touch this
Never heard someone say so much but yet say so little
He sounds mentally ill bro retire
Great interview , even tho Brett Okamoto sucks
Is this  zombie fighting Khamza 🤔 😐 😑 he can't even talk how can he fight 🤔  Slapping time zombie 🧟‍♂️ Khamza will show you how to slap ......
Nate is awesome but a little delusional sometimes. They need to just pay the man what he is worth.
Wow he looks so old and fat now ? He’s getting kil**d brada
Nate's turning into Nick :(
Just because he lost to the "number one" guy doesn't make him number 2. He always has the most warped POV on things
This guy talking like mafia leader ,he should be leader or play mafia character on the movies :)
Sometimes you're a fan because the stats/records etc. There are fighters with amazing stats but 0 likeability or character.  Sometimes you're a fan because their realness/character. Most Nate fans love him for this💯  Now tell me another fighter in the ufc that was willing to accept this fight if they were Nate's age? Everybody gets old so to use that as a reason to hate or use against someone is just stupid.
We all love you nathan but game, you make me cry my friend because of how awesome you have been through your whole career ❤️ 💙 ♥️ 😢 💗 mad love and respect to you and what you have accomplished my friend!. You and your brother both are in my prayers along with your whole family brother!!;).
Once he gets comfortable Nate gives great answers.  Some call it rambling, but an answer is an answer.  He’s very smart & knows what the UFC is trying to do with this fight between him & Khamzat.  I hope he wins because that interview is going to be legendary.
Did not understand anything, but Nate is cool
Like most do, Nate lives in a bubble. Either way, he is a legend.
The Diaz brothers are fkn legendary.  Straight up hood kids💯
Nate is lucky he's entertaining, because he's the most delusional whiny diva in the UFC. No other fighter with his record has had the opportunities he's been given. Dude's just a scrappy gatekeeper acting like he's the goat lmao.
Always entertaining!
I understood this interview because I speak Diaznese
This was great Could really feel for Nate the pressure his family and friends must be under This intervieew has some wieght to it Meanwhile you have Khamzat going after Paulo Costa like hes got a crush on him
Don’t let him go out like this Dana
We stand with nate
Nate sounds drunk, high and punch drunk. After he gets knocked out he really needs to retire. What's sad is Nate is one of my favorite all time fighters but he's done.
why does everyone ignore the extreme brain damage this man has? weird... someone who cares about Nate should take care of him...
Nate Rocks
It's BJ Penn in hall of fame? I think he should be... Just based on whatever little material I have seen...
Diliousional mf. 😕🙄
Let’s go Nate. Shock the world again and beat that mouse 🐀
Sorry nate you are not the best ever ufc fighter maybe best chin ever...
The Realest!
He’s needs a title shot and not just be the gatekeeper
He's friggin awesome
23:55
Nate Diaz is uncommon among uncommon men
Nate Diaz Always A Legend. He's A Different Breed!!
The true G.
Nate gonna win!!!! 💯
Nate does Khamzat impression 14:41 LOL!
I rate Nates career, he's been in many wars, say what you want his resume is impressive
I honestly thought he would win this fight unless he got cut….. but after this… he has serious brain damage 😔
Mans so tough Im excited for sat!!!
Hay Nate ARMY !! Will you put your 💰 on him ??!!😉 Be honest .
Nate diaz vs Jamahal hill next 😅
Oooo man! This is gonna be good!!
This is like a reverse sketch of Between 2 Ferns lol
32:10 yeah Adesanya 😄
CTE BABY
Nate has a whole army behind him with or lose we here for you Nate !
Ignorance is bliss
Nate is the G.O.A.T
Brett is so cringe
“You fought burns dawg you fought burns” lmao that’s all that needs to be said especially after Herburt’s recent fight 😂
yea, Nate is a beast, the kind of guy Top Guys know they can beat but ain't anxious to fight at all! He's a little psycho, going into a fight "I didn't even want ... with a Killer ... that has to kill me"! It's also clear that the UFC is sacrificing this guy to "make Khamzat". Not cool at all!
Yup Nate even says when the interview is over !!
Eloquent as always!
"This was a great interview brett" but brett barely asked question, Nate was just talkin 😂
Love you Nate ❤️
This interview needed an Ariel.
He doesn't seem happy fighting Khamzat.  It seems he has been forced for taking this fight
This isn’t an interview it’s a monologue 😂
Nate the only one to punk USADA
The way the ufc is doing him so dirty after he’s done a great job for them, it’s sad
Are you high Nate 😂😂😂
People don’t understand if Nate loses, he didn’t lose.
I’m proud to say I’m born and raised in Stockton because Nate and Nick. I’m also proud to say I’m from Stockton because of the history this city has of great fighters; martial artist and Escrimadors. We all fight with heart because we have too. Go 209🔥
It was so frustrating to see how Nick Diaz was treated by the UFC, Media, and the Fans. Nick Diaz career was ruined by the UFC. And I’m glad the new generation Fans actually appreciate him as much as they appreciate Nate. Cause back then, a lot of people hated them
Hey Nate!! I hate to say this? You are about to get a BEAT DOWN SON? BY ROUND 2 I WOULD START MAKING PLANS TO BOX JAKE PAUL?
What a legend but CTE is real huh. it sucks the way the UFC used him, why dont they ever give him a layup fight. what a real interview glad this guy let him talk.
Your welcome dubai 🤣🤣
Come out similar to what you did against Donald Cerrone🔥
This video made me despise dana white and the ufc smh
am I the only one not buying this card because the high possibility of tony and nate being brutalized.....huffffff
So much CTE though
All I hear is Mike Tyson voice LOL
This reminds of Nick when he fought Robbie Lawler he doesn't even understand why this fight is really happening.
I love you Nick and Nate love from India
This is what someone looks like when they bout to get that death sentence 😂 He doesn't have a bit of a chance that's why I will not be purchasing this PPV it won't even be competitive.  He had a good career tho lol I am not buying to the pundits saying he is built different and anything could happen.
13:55 - "This Fight is not even about this guy, its about MAKING this guy". So true.
Props for not interrupting and letting Nate speak his mind.
I'll smoke my weed and you do your steroids lmfao
a complete contrast of personalities in this interview
Imagine if Nate TKOs Kamzat, that would be an insane way to go out.
Nate came into this fight basically saying “i was Nate Diaz before Conor was Conor, before Kamaru was Kamaru” he pioneered the fight game not off of enticing but subtle entertainment. If this is his last fight in the UFC, he will have forever changed the game that all of us fans love, today.
where the facts....he fought Burns dog.....Nate is gold!!!!
hes righr lol
Is it me or is his speech different then any time before? I don’t recall hearing him more then after a fight but it seems to me like he’s acquired a speech impediment and a lisp. I’m in no way making fun but this is very concerning as a fan of his as a fighter!
The homie is drunk...
Nate is so humble he points out all that made him proud to only be himself.  He's going to f up khamzat, the motor mouth.
LEGEND LOVE YOU FROM 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
“You wanna know why my why my brother is the best fight to ever, because everything besides that. “ Nate Diaz
All i can say about this interview is that "I'm not surprised mf". Nate went against top 10 fighters almost whole of his career and nobody finished him off convincingly even once, straight up G. The Diaz brothers are legends of the sport, almost mythical in aura.
Please add time stamps
Dude the Diaz brother sound punch drunk
i watched this man since the ultimate fighter. og
Let's go Nate
About 50% of this interview is non-sequiturs. He starts with a thought, but goes somewhere else.
Sounds bitter
💯You do Steroids I’ll smoke weed and let’s fight”🤣so many legendary quotes from Nate in 1 interview.
Nate speaks like he is super tired😫
Win or lose your my guy still👊🏾💯🇯🇲
20:00 “ Adesanya , nigganu” omg I died when Nate said this 😭😭😭😭😭
Brett Okamoto is by far the absolute WORST interviewer his questions always are awful to be honest with any fighter he asks questions too stick the dude in the back on one of the cameras ffs
Nate is the GOAT....  my favorite fighter of all time...  utmost respect to this man.....
He always keeps it real. Get it Done Nate. Much respect 🙏 👏
My man Nate.. He is real boss hopes he wins! Feel the disrespect towards him😌
The way he scoffs at oliveira is how everyone should view him as a champion.
Nate is the champ of the whole UFC. If Nate Diaz is fighting I'm watching.
Nate Diaz is beloved in this sport.
When Brett asked Nate, why Khamzat Chimaev, Nate was trying to explain that when he was an up and coming fighter, he had no desire to fight the legends of the sport at that time like BJ Penn, etc because he respected them but these modern day fighters take joy in knocking out or beating the legends of this new era like a Nate Diaz himself, or when Izzy beat Anderson Silva, or how Usman wanted to fight a retired GSP! I never thought about it like that but Nate made a great point! Much respect to you fam, hope you win! Let’s go 🔥NATE🔥!!!
This is my favorite interview of all time. I’m completely serious
This is sad. How can we pretend that this guy is mentally capable of making decisions. It’s like a tutor speaking to a special needs kid
Wait, didn't Nate loose to Leon Edwards?
Mismatched fight. Made me go from a Khamzat fan to thinking Khamzat is Dana’s little company yes man.
Imagine if Nate won and they made him vs Leon in the UK...
Low key I see sadness in nates eyes knowing he might never fight for the ufc again.
Amazing interview Thankyou so much !
Could you imagine the scenes if Nate wins. Let's go Diaz.
I hate to call it but seems like we have a winner here.
Nate via triangle choke while flipping off the entire arena
This fight is truly a David vs Goliath that will do down in the MMA Bible. You can smell a legendary performance coming. Nate still has something special left in the tank.
“This was a great Interview Brett I have to go” The Nate Diaz way to end an Interview
did you people all hear that, from the goat himself, if you do sneaky steroids, your of the question. WAR DIAZ
Absolute Legendary Legend.
Nate phuk the system Diaz
now that I think about it GOATS like IZZY,GSP,USMAN,ANDERSON have been knock the F out .... NATE has been beaten but never knock out cold ... UFC should most def respect this man .
Diaz is the man!
Let's go Nate Diaz 🔥🔥🔥🔥
8.07 🤣 badass
Never thought I'd say this, but he doesn't want to be here. He doesn't wanna fight him.
" If you a fkn Mr. Goat make a Goat  ... prove  it! " -Nate Diaz 💪🏽😤
When he said I’m the entire Champ of the UFC and I couldn't find myself disagreeing with him. Live this Legend man. He’s literally the peoples Champ.
Nate diaz has been around since 2007 let's see half these guys go that long and see what these guys look like after that long of a career
25 mins: " If you mister Goat then make a Goat".   -Nate.
Best interview I have ever seen from Nate. Thank you
I think ND has taken too many blows to the head 🤦‍♂️ ,,,,I fear for his safety against Khamzat
Ahhh I luv the way he just gets up hey this was a great interview  But I have to go lmfwao
He’s such a douchebag. The gangsta with a lisp. I do hope he beats that cleft lipped loser though
“I’m the champ of the entire f****** UFC”  You know what Nate, yes you are lol
"I refuse to be lame". 🐐
Hard to watch mid way through Nate got me in my feels. Pain is temporary. Pride is forever. Much love Nate!
Nate wins in the 5th
Nate's angry that he's being written off before the fight starts. That makes him very dangerous. Don't be surprised if he finishes Khamzat
It's Nick Diaz Army, Nathan. It's war game. Kill or be killed. Represent.
Bro been hit so many times he think it 365 first dates irl
can’t stand brett
did he say something about bj penn?
“If you’re Mr. Goat, then make a goat.” Nate Diaz  Seriously, he’s fought all top fighters, and created goats because of it. If he beat them, he would still be considered an underdog in his following fight. That’s where his anger should be focused.
The goat
I got Nate taking it fuk that!!
"You should've worked on a Computer or something,you nerd." 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Real Talk calling it out as it is. Don't make excuses for Boring matches with "it's a Technical Fight." " You're a Casual." If a fight is Boring its Boring
Why is ESPN video and audio quality always so bad?
IS IT just me, or does Nate  have some difficulties expressing him self.. ?
Nate looking old
I hope nate reads these comments he got massive love and support and not sure he even nos it 💚
Something about this interviewer that I’m not keen on …
Did he just say he don’t want this fight?
Either he’s a totally stoned, got serious CRE or a combination of both.
Diaz Army! “That boy has a rock chin” - Conor McGregor
"you do steroids , I'll smoke weed , and then let's get in their and scrap " 😂
Love both the Diaz Bros. Truth speakers from the heart eztrordinaire.
Nate has filled Nick’s shoes so well. This really is a testament to Nick, and it’s awesome to see how Nate acknowledges that and tells us all that this is because of his big brother - the true OG. Nate Diaz is an icon. What a legend.
Probably the most misunderstood fighter in UFC history. Underrated is an understatement. He's owed alot more than what he has been given, respect wise, notoriety and honor. Regardless of the UFCs motive is behind this upcoming fight or result, Nate Diaz will be always respected as a UFC LEGEND.
Sounds like a goodbye from Nate... The UFC will not be as powerful without NICK & NATE... They are ICONS of the MMA. Nick made Nate . Nate is a real Dogg even for a mil I will step in a cage against him. Respect champ..you are the real champ PERIOD!
"Your welcome" - Nate Diaz
Y’all can see how scared he is you’re gonna lose  don’t even try run at home 😂😂
Nates forgotten more about fighting than most people remember
I will always refer to Nate as my spirt animal!! NICk DIAZ AMRY MFers.
Fedor....real recognize real
Not many men through UFC can say they are the same now as they were when it all began .
Crazy to see someone like Nate give their whole life to this sport (First UFC fight at 21 years old) and to see how far he's come yet he's still the same Nate Diaz. A true G and a true person down to the core.
I'm ashamed of myself for making fun of Nate in the past. I got it so wrong! I hope he wins this Sunday and give the UFC the middle finger!
Nate is the man
12:56 real talk
Mate love nate but Leon f'd u up and masvidal did the same...yes you have a granite chin but your gonna end up brain damaged if you keep taking all these shots..
Man nate is real❤️🙏
UFC wants to make this guy ? Let’s make him!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why's the audio so quiet??
zoom out?
Nate complains so much!
I like how Nate controlled the whole interview then tells Brett he’s out. This is why the UFC didn’t like him, the man can’t be controlled.
This was an amazing interview. Once Nate started to open up, he just went off & seems like he couldn't stop expressing everything he felt for all these years. He is one of very first fighters who got me interested in this sport. Mad, mad respect 🙏 Hoping for a historical moment but I won't be surprised!!!
Nate got a Robert de Niro face
is there an unedited version?
Watching one of the last super stars of my time that I have had a privilege to watch after him its just Tom Brady left I don't know who else is still around from the early 2000s   God bless nate he's been genuine since day 1
still the thug that we and love..Nates army..💪
Man his speech has gotten worse throughout the years to much damage taken in this game .
Nate is bullshittin on high I never understood half of it
Talks like he been hit too many times
One more time Nate!
This guy and his brother deserve a movie 🎥
Who tf is that guy doing the interview? He’s trash even in the Kumshot interview
No hate on Nate but this man is DELUSIONAL
Sad to see the toll the damage has taken over time.
Nate's impersonation of Usman was bang on
Bruh CTE is a real thing.
He right though
16:28 I’m dying 🤣🤣🤣
“I’m the champion of the whole UFC”
When y'all praise the ufc just remember that this man gave the ufc 17 years of service. Fought his heart out every time and this is the THANKS he gets. Also was making 50g and less until 2015. They screwed him over time after time. The ufc sickened  me with this
The realest man in all of the celebrities not only ufc WAR DIAZ LETS GO !!!!!
Nate the fuckn goat!!!!
Attitude!!!
The OG Diaz❤️❤️
Nate Diaz army mf!!!!!!!
God I love Nate Diaz.
FFS Brett do some dam homework on Nate before interviewing him and maybe then he'll respect ya DORK
I like Nate Diaz
Hard to hear this man speak
Diaz will win
Nate has already won.  He's the people's champ.  Whatever the outcome of this fight.  Nate's gonna represent!
So punch drunk & burnt, he can't even speak properly. I hope he survives the fight
bj penn was the man
Please let him shock the world dear heavenly father. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
I’m sorry, but it’s sad how his pot head brain seems to work in slow motion when it come to articulating what he wants to say. How better could he be if he was clean.
Fidor milenko 😂🤣
I hope you win this one man! All the best!
Nick's imitation of Usman was on point
lol when he realized they might sign all his friends and then he might have to fight them! hahahaaha
Nate's Usman impression is pretty good 🤣
Interviewers are like "Ah s**t, I gotta interview a Diaz". They ask all these drawn out questions looking for an intricate answer. Diaz be like "Yeah, I f**king guess".
Brett has compassion....even though he's a company man...He interviews very well.
"you fought burns dawg... you fought burns"
Last fight pretty much hopefully he gets this dub
"This is just my halftime show" Nate Diaz
Is this an interview or a therapy session with a physiologist 😂
Lol “this was a great interview, Brett, I have to go.”
Diaz is the lowest energy human being
Nate is nothing but all heart. Respect.
Fedor malenko. Ha !
“I’m champion of the whole UFC” Nate Diaz
Nate kinda reminds of that homeless dude that you ask “why are they homeless” and it’s hard to understand them and then they say it’s other peoples fault that they are homeless.    Gangster
24:03 finally someone says it. If you do roids, you’re not in the discussion for GOAT status.
“I refuse to be lame”  - awesome
Diaz & Ferguson!!!  Would be amazing
Totaly agree Fedor is champion thats a fact
You take steroids and ill smoke weed and lets get in there n squab 🤣🤣🤣
I don't know how Brett kept a straight face during this.
“If your the goat, make a goat” - Nate diaz
Nate The Great
The fight we want is conor vs diaz 3
Aye Nate spoke Spanish 💯
Nate said we are all going to war with him, the haters and the lovers. He's taking us fans to war, win lose or draw we are behind him
Love em or hate em, we'll never see another Nate/Nick Diaz in the UFC PERIOD!
Only 3 real UFC fighters in the GOAT conversation: Anderson Silva, GSP & Jon Jones! And if you disagree, you might wanna learn what GOAT actually stands for… and then look up WORLD TITLE DEFENSES
Dana might kill two of his stars in one fight. One on a stretcher, another in the eyes of Diaz’ fans. Bad move by Dana.
“You do steroids, I’ll smoke weed”
OWE! 🤕
its like nate holding tears back because all the emotion is building up, the presser is gonna be even better
Guy he’s going against is good and he hasn’t fought in a minute.
High asf lol
Nates going for broke tune in he's coming with expression
Nate’s right it’s a war against the organization
good luck Nate
So there’s your reason for contract negotiating problems Asking for a Francis fight  Asking to sign like 10 guys in order to re sign him  And I’d imagine a bigger contract for him self  I like Nate but he’s just being ridiculous here
Nate is the 🐐
Nate is gonna shock the world once again! I Love MMA!
My favorite part about a Nate Diaz interview is like 10-15 minutes into it when he's gotten comfortable and goes from one word answers to just absolutely classic monologues.
This dude fr from Stockton. He really real man.  S/O to the Interviewer for letting him talk. Nate be sounding like he brain dead some times 😂😂😂 but once he got his thoughts together, you could tell how annoyed he was by everything.
What a legend the mental of why he should fight Francis now I understand 💯
WAR DIAZ!
Sounds like my last brain cell trying to argue with itself.
You do steroids and I'll smoke weed
Too much brain damage...its sad
The GOAT journeyman
Loving all the love being thrown Nate’s way 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼win or lose the Diaz army always on top let’s get that straight
Legendary interview.
Be aware,khamzat eat gangsters for breakfast 🍳
Respect for the OG..
“You do Steroids, i’ll smoke Weed.. we get in there…” 😂😂😂😂😂❕❕❕❕
The real deal mf McCoy!
You gotta love him
Nates the coolest motherfucker to ever fight in the ufc
Go get the W this weekend Nate!!! Time to shock the world!!
‘I refuse to be lame’. What a fighter Nate Diaz is, hope he wins
Nate suddenly really looks like nick
propper boaring lising to this lad
"You're welcome Abu dhabi"... that's hard
he has the same sadness is his eyes as mike Tyson
He doesnt know it but he is one of the greatest fighters to stand foot in the UFC if he didnt smoke weed and trained alot more he would be the unidsputed champ right now.
BO SUCKS at interviewing
Is he joking
On boring champions “You shoulda worked on a computer somewhere you nerd” 😂
is he high?
So, he was never champion cause he was always champion of the junkies? Stop interviewing washed-up, concussed mfs. I guess after Saturday, you won't have to do it anyways.
I love this guy.
He is broken mentally and physically.  Sad to see him like this. His lack of education, not being able to express himself accurately, erratic not being able to sit still.  Smoking and harm to your body is an injustice to one’s self.  He has killed himself for what? Fans who will talk about how great he was when he is senile in a hospital or sleeping rough when older?
Nate will always be a soldier in my eyes. He deserves the respect and recognition for all that he has accomplished.
Nate vs. The world.
G.O.A.T 💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥
This interviewer is so trasshh couldve been anybody asking the flash card questions
The Diaz Brothers are the best ever.
Nate ftw
Nate is a real og Mentioning the goat Fedor! In Fedors prime he’d smash Francis and Jones! No doubt in my mind!
If you don't like Nate, you need to check yourself. Ride or die he's in! One of the best people you can have on your side!!
Nate is out of hs mind. The majority of people around the World have no Idea who those Great fighters, He clearly has brain damage!
"if you a goat, then make a goat"
Looks like he did when he competed on TUF.  A little meatier maybe. 🔥 Not really a fan of either fighter but  I think it  would be cool for Diaz to get a finish.  If this is truly his last fight for UFC 🤣😁🤣 BANG HARD AND LIGHT THAT DUDE UP SATURDAY NIGHT 🧨🧨🧨
The way he just ended the interview hahahaah love it
LEGEND
He’s right, this entire fight seems disrespectful to Nate but he’s a warrior so it’s on
“I made this fool fight you stupid” 😂
That. Was. Gold.
Nate really didn't promote Road 2 War at all. I'm a fan of him and I didn't even know this channel existed
“This was a great interview Bret, I have to go.” -Nate Diaz 👊🏾
I'm being serious I think he has had a brain injury
“You do steroids, I smoke weed, so let’s get in there a squab”- Nate Diaz  Gotta love this guy 🤣
Brett’s gettin a contact high just asking questions
I don’t care what people say this guy he is the legend much respect your family Diaz brother
Interviewer is trash
33:27 the high wore off. I’ve gotta go.
"This is just my halftime show!"
The reason why I box, good luck Nate🥊
Nate has become more and more likeable throughout his career
Bunch of nerds.....LOLOLOLOL...legend.
This was heartbreaking to watch
I used to hate Nate, I love him now.  I hope lands a bomb on khamzat.  Khamzat is a beast, but like Usman anyone can be slept.
This is kinda sad tbh
Great interview, I have to go.
Too much weed. Wasted his career waiting for what? I hope he does well but I think he's delusional about his abilities and downplays his opponents.  Think he was the champ all this time and losses to 50/50 Jorge. Great career and fun to watch but hope he retires.
Your #1 Nate  go do what you do best 👍
“ you do steroid & i smoke weed lets get in there and squab” haha legendary
Lmao. “This was a great interview Brett, I have to go”.
Every other time he said he felt disrespected. I knew he didn't really mean it. Made a lot of money in UFC. More than most. This time though. He's hurt. He thought he'd get the Kobe farewell tour
I would like to hear this interview from inside Nate's head, I'm sure it sounds A LOT different.
Let’s be honest this interview just isn’t the same without Ariel
Why the video quality is so low? 720p? really?
I think the UFC is sending him to slaughter just because of his name and legacy so they can sell alot of ppv views he is almost 40 and khamzat is way younger and undefeated. Shame on Dana.
Nate’s story about not resigning bc his boys didn’t get signed is as real as it gets. Nate did what all of us said we would
you can tell Brett knows how to deal with interviews
Diaz doesn't have many brain cells left. He says he didn't ask for this fight, but he actually did, lmao. Dude can't form a simple sentence
Nate is not suppose to win this fight. Respect for nate for having the nuts to take this fight
CTE on display to the max. Praying Nate gets a quick clean victory with minimal damage. Can't even articulate anymore.
Hopefully he derails the hype train.
I have so much love for Nate and Nick. I can relate so much with their social anxiety, there trauma-induced behavior, their commitment to a family team...it means so much to be able to support him this weekend
dude is so loaded lol , im sure he feels more like himself when he is high haha ((all relaxed))
Nate is the Real Peoples Champion ... Win or Lose . He's #1 to me.
Legendary interview from a legendary fighter ✊
Nate is crazy 🤦‍♂️
I wish Nate Diaz had a younger brother named Norm Diaz, and we could start this Diaz Army all over again. Respect to Nate, and Nick, and all the Army.
6-5 in his last 10 fights. Kamaru Usman 9-1 last 10 fights with 5 straight title defenses. That's why he's a goat and your not. That CTE is affecting this dudes brain. "I'm a goat cause I fought everybody" fighting everybody doesn't mean you are beating everybody, lol. Also, how many years between fights? 15 year fight career but how many of those years weren't you active?
This guy Brent is such a Hamster.what a Dumb set of Questioning... .fire him espn...get a real reporter in there this guy thinks he is a psychologist he is not Cut out for this like Ariel.. . You got this Nate! Drag him into deep water. ! And finish him!.
Win or lose Nate is and always will be an incredible fighter and warrior as well as Nick. Good luck in the upcoming fight Nate.
Everybody loves nate
I like how he has respect for Leon, Fedor anyone who is real, under appreciated and being done dirty by the UFC
This reporter is so bias I wish Diaz would’ve smacked him
Bunch of nerds. Lol
209 FTW
This interview with Nate is like watching him fight, he gets better as it goes on. What a G. 😂
"you do steroids , ill smoke weed then we can get in there and squabble" -Nate Diaz
Bruh 16:27 that head rub and “he fought Buuuuurrnnns” 😂😂😂😂😂 took me out hadda pause the video & “Nate Usman” my new fave mma character 😭
AHHAHAHAHAH omg the Usman impression.
They need to up the camera/video quality man. Especially at this level
I pray nate wins 🙏
Hey my brother Nate Diaz I know what you talking about brother but I don't think everybody's getting it so just stay strong we will get there
Nate is top 5!
serious question - is he hammered?
Good to hear him call out Jon Jones for the steroid use.
Shoutout 209
The fans know who the Diaz brothers are...even if the UFC dont give a monkey's.I'll never forget seeing Nick Diaz's school photo...6 yrs old with a balled up fist to the sky while everybody else is smiling.The Diaz brothers will leave with the love and respect of the fans.
He and his brothers are legends. As much as I like Khamzat's fighting style I want Nate to win this. He is just more entertaining than Khamzat. It is sad that he never got the belt but he is much more entertaining than these millenial bums .
Such an OG man. REAL
Diaz is a confused dude. Low IQ + CTE = This.  Still be hoping he beats Khamzat though.
209
Why is he bald
Sounds as if he hasn’t smoked in a couple of days, I wouldn’t put it past him getting off of it for a couple of days before a fight. He sounds clearheaded and as focused as he can be. I might be wrong.
You do steroids, I smoke weed … Let’s get it on- Nate Diaz  true og respect 👊🏻💯
God, Nate hates doing this lmao
PS: WHEN YOU BEAT CONNOR YOU ALSO BEAT DANNA WHITE THAT MADE EVERYONES DAY . NATE ……….WIN WIN WIN WIN
100%
I'm a natural fan of Nate but in this rambling, stream of consciousness interview he comes across as incoherent, resentful, delusional and disrespectful to other warriors. Genuinely saddening.
"I'll fight a n*gga on steroids" - Nate Diaz
I’m a Khamzat fan on this fight but after this interview a piece of me wants Nate to win just so he can stick his fingers up
Sounds like white mike Tyson no lie hope he shocks everyone tho let’s go nate
'Pressure's on you, I don't give a fook'
Man it’s gonna be real sad to hear what Nate sounds like in a couple of years he should just stop fighting man
Nate is one of a kind not just a fighter….A Warrior who fights with his whole heart ❤️.    And what a heart ‼️
Legend
Facts fedor never joined ufc cause he knew
“Everyone has a 5 year career in the UFC.  4 years, 7, 8, 9 max, 12 if…”    Nate Diaz
Why would you censor a nate diaz interview, that’s like using a snickers wrapper as a condom
Nate round four rear naked choke
Real G
This the only guy that can lose and still be on top RESPECT goes along way 🙏🏻
Sounds like Nate has severe brain damage from all the punched and elbows he took to the head throughout his career.
I don't care if Nate loses his next 10 fights, put him and his brother in a real street fight against anyone in their weight class and Diaz boys rise to the top. Everyone who has watched them long enough knows that is facts. Everyone that fights them knows that is facts
Awesome to see Nate sharing his stories 🙌🏼❤️👊🏼
Nate catches a lot of slack for having CTE or whatever but he had it right, him vs Cerrone was in fact on the Lesnar vs Overeem card.   Quick slackin Brett.
Why don't you have this in at least 1080p? Come on, you're suppose to be ESPN MMA.
Stream of consciousness Nathan Diaz is the man.
It's like I know exactly what he's saying but I still gotta squint to listen lol
This guy is f. Legend
nate see's str8 through kamaru my mannnn!!! ahah real recognise real
This is what the ufc does to their fighters …. Sad. I didn’t understand one sentence Nate said
Ahh come on nate Conor ain’t no nerd
Why did ESPN film this with a potato?
This is how cali mfs get down! Real recognize real, Nate wins by tko calling it
If i had a shot every time he touches he’s face . I’d be F***up
“If you’re the goat, make a goat” is cold
I got my life savings on him, I know he can do it
"you do your steroids, i'mma smoke my weed and let's scrap" lmao
@29:30 lol best part of the interview
i cant tell if these quotes in the comments are ironic or not 💀
Nate calling ppl nerds is the best lmao. Love him
Great interview Nate , u know what im sayin
I still cant believe man think burns can smoke nate 🙈
I hate these meaningless question. How is one even supposed to answer any of them?
This was pure emotions..  Great interview.
12:35 im gonna miss nate bro is so funny😭
The mental decline is tough to watch
Nick Diaz Army 💯
CONOR was the undefeated lineal champ champ and Nate finished him and didn’t get a title fight
what a man , he is the real fighter, he is the definition of fighter .      what a DOG fight it can be man, let go nate , lets go man,
They didn’t stack the card which is a little suspicious. They (ufc) seem to have some type of zero love to see off a legend. Kinda cut throat approach. I see his point. He is a real person, that takes a lot in and thinks a lot. He’s a  legend for sure.
When he started to mimic usman he sounded so on point,he should of carried on lol
I UNDERSTAND WHAT NATE SAYS HE HAS HAD SO MANY WARS THE GUY WHO FOUGHT KAMARU OR BEAT KAMARU HAD MORE TROUBLE WITH NATE FOR SOME REASON I THINKS ITS JUST THE NATURE OF THE SPORT AND SO UNPREDICTABLE. NATE YOU ARE A GOAT AND MY FAVORITE FIGHT WAS WHEN YOU BEAT CONNOR I JUST WANTED TO CRY . I didn’t I wanted to but man .CONNOR NEED A Whippen and you gave it to him .
Love Diaz boys but they have to be the smartest dumb mofos ever. Like idiot savants.
Imagine if Nate pulls out the day of the fight to sabotage the UFC. The type of guy he is I doubt he’d do anything like it.
Nate Diaz!!!
I love Nate Diaz but he’s soooo stuck in the 2000’s. Talking to him is literally like taking a step back into the past. He hasn’t evolved at all since he’s come to the ufc
Might be C.T.E, might be the weed… that’s all I’m saying.
Real Fighting Corporation > UFC 😂😂😂🔥🔥
“You should have work on a computer somewhere, you nerd!” 🤣🤣🤣
CTE has scrambled his brain, he can’t even talk ☹️
Mad props to Nate....Toughest dude in the game IMHO
this fight will be great. cant wait. hope nate shut´s everybody up
Nate coming to the interview high as a mf
Can you just imagine the incredible amount of people that will be routing for him this Saturday?
“You do steroids, I’ll smoke weed, and let’s get in there and scrap” - Nate Diaz
Dude prolly got CTE as they cheer him on sluring words he's fun to watch, but mentally hes not all there and nobody's worried be careful who u call friends
Nate diaz is being mistreated this Nate is being mistreated that. Welcome to the UFC, Dana and the board don't care. I'm just happy Nate knows exactly the position he is in
He rather fight then just win 🐐🐐
Love how nate doesn't even know the guys name he's fighting.  Doesn't matter.  He's fighting whoever they put on the list
Should have been Tony and Nate at Welterweight, not Tony Li and Nate Khamzat
DIAZ ARMY MFERS!!!!!!!!
Let's go! Nate you can do it...
When is press conference?
Hahahaha these guys kill me. Straight up ranting about a conversation he is having in his head then 💥 "This was a great interview" I'm like that unfortunately, Adderall makes a huge difference, I wonder if they would be better or worse with it. I've never tried weed, I can see how it would slow ones mind down though, probably better for you than something that is basically meth.
Hope you shake up the world again Nate
I want Nate to win so bad , everything he’s saying is so true . Where’s the respect to one of UFC all time great’s . It’s all business in the end .
Nate the goat 🐐
Respect to the legend nate 🙏 🙌.    Ufc has done him dirty, & giving him the khazmat fight shows how dirty they are still trying do him on his way out. This dude was miles on him always fighting the best; they should've gave him a fair money fight
I love how he refers to the championship as a "weird little goal." It's true, Nate is a genius.
When is ufc279?
Can’t speak on ufc legends and not say Diaz name, he’s one tough mfer
Tf is this dude talking about hahaha the Diaz bros never cease to crack me up
hope my boy nate wins
Nate preaching to these newbies
Even though i like nate. Sadly he will get beaten up bad
love how he reacted when he mentioned jones  EXACTLY - the Goat question is gone for a man who failed for steroids 3x alone
Nate Diaz is the G.O.A.T
Shades of pre Nick diaz interview at 266…
this is a case study in the effects of marijuana on the brain and cognitive abilities
You know what’s crazy, Nate Diaz always did his own thing right from the start and the ufc couldn’t chain him down. He becomes one of there biggest stars and they show no respect to the dude at all. That’s F’d up. “I’m not surprised mother Fker’”
Diaz army stand up 😤😤✊🏽
The Champ is here 💪🏼
Bret doesn’t know how to handle Nate lmao
Love how he just gets up and finishes his interview lol
who rendered this edit? Such a bad quality video. Its actually not even 720p. all pixelated!
Dude been hit in the head wayyyyy too much
“If you’re Mr. Goat than make another Goat” Nates a Legend
Nate don’t look in a good place here…. Hope to god he shocks the world
Guys (espn) I’ll buy you new microphones 🎤
This guy is the GOAT, not because of the fights he's won or lost, but because he's the one with the most respect! Everybody loves and respects Nate more than any other fighter, no matter what! That's some GOAT status right there.
Nate addressed how people glorify the belt so much and gave a great insight on how he looked at his career and what was best for him. Entertainment value. Say what you want, took the cards he was dealt with and did more!
Nate: I’m the champ of the whole ufc….everybody!😆😆😆😆  Shout out to Brett for just letting Nate conduct the interview completely on his own 🤣🤣🤣
1:58 is that a fart 💨??
Nate & Nick are the real deal
“I just did my thing and go back home and tell my homies that’s how you do it, that’s why I’m my own champ.” - Nate diaz
“This was a great interview Bret, I have to go.” Lmmfao 😂 I aspire to one day achieve this man’s level of give a fuk
wana see 5 rounds, no knockout no submission,
This interview is so good that I’m just expecting a cut to open up or a mouse start to form on Nate after every question!
Cream 1:24
Let's go nate. Win loose or draw. NDA
I love this guy. Respect.
“This is just my halftime show” 🥷
Damm seeing this make me really sad for Nate he deserves more from the ufc especially for all the things he has done for the Org. It’s just going to be sad seeing Nate get mauled by Khamzat like Iknow Nate is strong and he’s a warrior but this is just a mismatch smh khamzat is just to elite for Nate.
Nate Diaz has me rolling he’s so real
I would love to see him destroy khazmat - put the pressure on him like in the cowboy fight.
12:38 Pauses… forgets “I’m the champion of whole ufc altogether and idgaf” 🤣🤣🐐🐐
Real fighter right here u don't get fans like Nick and Nate fans , no steroids just injected with badass 💪
Nate never got the respect he deserves he should have been the biggest thing after beating Connor the first time but it seemed like the UFC DIDN'T WANNA GIVE HIM PRESS AFTER HE BEAT THE MONEY MAKER
Respect for this OG NATEEE DIAZZZZ HE KINDA LOOKS PISSED BUT HEADS UP LOSE OR WIN I LOVE THIS GUY.
I don’t give a fooook either lmfwao
"I haffta go!" Lmfao  F*ckin' comedy 🤣
He looks like Thanos in the The thumbnail
The best of the best. No fighter is beating Nate, only the clock.
Looking like Little Foot Silva
bro Brett please stfu and stop saying "mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm" all the fking time
I can’t understand a thing he’s saying, bless you Nate
Put captions i dont understand half of his words
"If u wanna do steroids be upfront bout it,dont be "sneaksteroiding"  xD
NDA
He's starting to show signs of CTE like slurred speech. I hope the only real champ remains in good health.
This interview alone just sold more ppv than karuma usman fights
This feels like a funeral. Farewell Nathan, thanks for the memories.
Nate Diaz is the last of the Mohicans, once he retires there's nobody left besides Lawler and Nick. A true legend.
I love how he says keep it in the open. If you wanna shoot up steroids, I’ll smoke a blunt, and let’s squab!! Awesome perspective! But don’t hide it.
My boi talking sounding like my 85 yr old grandpa with the way he hopping around stories 🤣😂 hope you win tho good luck
Man ,nate is teared up..F khamzat.. I will support Diaz for life
THIS FIGHT IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY REAL FIGHT INC ON THE EXPENSE OF UFC...
Nate Diaz has that non chalant attitude about him that just makes him scary because you know he has no fear of fighting anybody.
This is the best Nate Diaz interview!! Calling Champions nerds and almost beaten up Dana White is pure gold.
Nate Diaz....you are the BEST!!!! TRUTH!
Luv and respect for Nate the m' fckn Great! His legacy is already etched in stone!💯✊
“I refuse to be lame”
lol @ this was a great interview Brett I gotta go !     GOAT 🐐 NATE
I love Nate but he always sounds like he woke up from a 100year nap
stupid questions ... i dont know why nate did not punch him in the face
Did he say I’ll fight niggas on steroids??
Listen Nate people best believe he's the real fvckin deal people he real life 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧💯💯💯💯👽👽👽👽
Goat Wins Slap Next Best & More All Four Letter Words Just Like Both Nick Nate & Diaz Surp*Rise Surp💪Rise!
“This was a great interview Brett!” lmaoooo
"I'll bet it was the Diaz brothers.." Frank Lopez
Nate might not speak fluently... but I think he's actually pretty smart. I like this version. It's crazy to hear his point of view
Ufc will go nuts if Nate pulls another upset just like the Conor fight
War Diaz!!
Love you brotha Nate Diaz the goat
We need Ariel to do these
win or lose nate still on my top 5 list   my man is the og  been in the game for a minute now i will always be a fan
I wonder if the UFC has promoters more like boxing does would it be better for the fighters which I'm sure it would because it dont let have the UFC have all the control
Pls someone add subtitles. Youtube ones are jibberish.
Incoherent.   “Champion of the whole UFC”   Poor guy doesn’t want to fight this guy so bad. It’s almost sad.
Big big respect to Nate always love him an nick the most real in the game , and your guaranteed a good scrap
“All my guys in or I am out” that’s the real life gangster. Kinda statement only see in god father. Khamzat calling himself gangster, will he be able to talk ufc in that way? Not a chance
You can’t really forget or deny what this man has done in his career or the sport. They can say all they want about his record but the recognition speaks for itself. Him and his brother straight savages and legends of the sport.
Props to Brett Okamoto for pulling 30 captivating minutes out of a somewhat unwilling participant!
Wish there was an uncensored version
In a real street fight, with no time limit, no break etc i would always put my money on Nate, i really think he is the best fighter in the world when it's kind to fight for your life.  He can't be knocked out, almost can't being submit too with his excellent BJJ, can take a shot like no men and has tremendous cardio !
Why Nate have more smoke for Usman than he does Khamzat? What did Usman do to make him that mad 😂😂😂
MY BOY DIAZ!!
Why we love nate diaz. This interview was great Brett I got to go. Later 😆 🤣 good stuff
Love his interviews 😂
"You welcome UFC, you welcome DUBAI and whatever country you are in "-nate diaz .
Idk why diana agree about khamzat vs nate. Why not tonny? Veteran vs veteran will be respectable fight.  Let khamzat agains nate is like little disrispect for a veteran whos maybe or mostly will retire. Its bad way to say goodbye to him. Also if khamzat lose, ufcphoria about khamzat will gone. Atleast for a short time.
He's a dead man walking
18:20
When Diaz says war its WAR
He’s right. He’s fought nothing but top ten guys for his entire career in two different divisions while being clean (no PEDs) and keeping the fight a fight, no game plan, no nut hugging, and no running, always kill or be killed.
Nates a real one for sure, real CTE case study…
Huge points made about the UFC building up ppl who haven’t fought all the best in the rankings. Most of the fighters don’t pick their fighters. Only a few Izzy and Charles olivera, etc have picked their opponents just to prove they’re the best.
Man if you don't like Nate something's wrong with you...
dude can hardly speak. A lot of people consider themselves huge fans but you're going to pay money to see him get his head smashed.
Does anybody know how much money Diaz earns for a fight? i am just curious
This might be Khamzat Chimaevs toughest fight yet
How are we not talking about getting help for this guy? There's clear brain damage going on. If this was any other fighter people would be up in arms about how delusional he is and how he needs help and better people/support around him but because it's Nate yall pretend it's normal
YYYYYYYYEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS INJECT A HALF OUR OF NATE DIAZ INTO MY VEINS
Crazy that’s Nate’s last 2 fights are Leon
He's got his sun glasses on the wrong way round!
They said he couldn’t beat Conor, but he did.  I always plan on winning every fight, but if for some reason I lose, the other guy will know that he was in a fkn fight.
Is it me, or does Nate seem uneasy? Like he’s on something? He keeps touching his head, his face, etc.
gilbert burns already proved khamzat chimaev is mostly hype nate has a way better chance than people think it's not surprising if he wins
People's Champ  win or lose , what you see is what you get 😎
Nate will win....  as he said, this dude fought burns.... just burns.... lol  hes SO OVER hyped.
Man .. nate only chance is submission I hope he pulls it off
Nick vs jake Paul.  Nate vs Logan Paul. Brothers vs brother. I’m sold take my money. Omg
Good luck nate 👊
Favorite fighter of all time
12:00
Nate talks like an NPC whose dialogue hasn’t been fully recorded yet
The people's champ right here. Never ducked anybody. He a dog
Wow..the goat
“They said I lost to Josh Thompson, or whatever”. Lol, he got TKOd by a head kick.
i didn’t understand but now i understand that nobody understands but it’s about the understanding you understand
"Thanks Brett, I have to go" LOL
Nigganu  😂😂😂😂
+2000 underdog
Did Nate say the N word at 23:57? 😂😂😂
i didn’t understand but now i understand that nobody understands but it’s about the understanding you understand
Much respect for nate he always showed heart he's a real warrior
Appropriate title: Nate Diaz therapy session with Doctor Brett Okamato
UFC version of Rocky vs Drago. Ready to witness war 💯 regardless of the outcome the fans win this one
Wow I actually feel mentally exhausted after every Diaz interview and that goes for both brothers lol.
It’s giving Mike Tyson
Something doesn’t feel right ?  Nate is not 💯
I don't see nate losing without cumshot throwing leg kicks
U can see it in his eyes that he dont wanna be there fighting
This interview is more like a final declaration
Haha his imitation of Kumaru was pretty good... How can someone not love the Diaz brothers
It would be pretty cool if he wins and does the I’m  not surprised motherfuckers.
Great interview. Can’t wait for Chaels take on this.
WAR DIAZ!
I've got a really bad feeling that this interview is going to be looked at very differently after Saturday. Respect to Nate
Nate dawg is going to splatter that scruffy bearded idiot.
Good job on this Brett
NATE Dawg KEEPING IT REAL!  LOVE Nate or HATE Nate, you have GOT TO GIVE NATE HIS PROPS!
Nate Goat & Nick Goat First Name Last Name Take Your Pick Four Letters in Both & in Both Brothers Names 🐐 💪🏆
Nates the kind of guy that would drop litter in your garden because he's too gangster to put it in the bin. Then when you ask him to pick it up and be respectful, he will start a fight with you for disrespecting him
Wow you can tell theres a lot of emotions swirling around in his brain for this one. The culmination of an incredible career. I really hope that he doesn't get slept or tko'd
Nate the goat bottom line
I really hope Nate win this 🙏🙏
It would be so funny if he beat Khamzat and derailed that whole narrative.
You can tell Nate is prepared and mentally ready for this fight.
Let’s go!!!!!
Nate’s a champion!!
Just imagine if Nate wins and walks out pointing his middle fingers to Dana. .now that would be something!
This is depressing 😔😔
I wish Nate wasn't such a hater. Guys like Khabib, Usman deserve a little more respect.
Nate vs tony would have been sick
Nate should try public speaking after he hangs the gloves up.
Diaz brothers are awesome.  Chip on their shoulders?  Constant chirping about their legacy?  Non-stop?   Not a humble bone in their bodies?  That's all they know.  It's real.
"You are welcome Dubai and all you motherfuckes in the country"                                                                                                             - Nate Diaz
15:19 Haha!
Brett is the wrong person to interview nate
209 BABY 👊🏽🔥👊🏽
Brett not nowing how to react a couple of times.
Real OG 🤙🏻👊🏻
DIAZ ARMY FOREVER✊
I realy have a bad feeling about this fight. I think nate is going to get hurt real bad.
I hate myself for Rooting against nate in the conor fights
LETS GO NATE!!!
never thought i could root any more for nate but here we are
This dudes interviews are clingy sometimes…asks the same question after he’s been given an answer
Man he aged terribly 😂
Chasing a belt that has a created meaning. There are people outside the ranking that would be any champ.
Horrible quality.. Please get 4k camera....
Nate looks like he is gonna die on Saturday,has a bad feeling , suicide operation vs khamzat
Nate is a little bit delusional.. but hes one of the toughest MF that walks the face of the earth. a true warrior. and I could love this MF more.
Such a legend
I'm glad I watched this interview....Brett does a really good job on these.  Nate is in between everything, almost like some kind of archetype.  To hear his perspective at this stage makes me understand why so many roit for him  He is not the most talented fighter and he has never been that guy holding the strap, being scared to lose it while be personally defined by it. He is a body work and his 'own champion'. There is a lot of integrity in that notion.  I remember watching him in the WEC and realizing how cagey and opportunistic he was for such a young dude.  I get what he is saying about the current ranked guys and how Khamzat, if he doesn't finish Nate, is basically just another guy posing for the limelight cast by the company.  I actually think the two are very similar in fight mentality and I'm sad this fight is happening in sone ways.
This interviewer suck’s!!!  Loosen up a bit
I Wana get in a headbutt competition with Nate
Wonder where Nate would be today had Dos Anjos not hurt his foot in 2016
I feel bad for 50yr old nate
dude WAS DOMINATED by Leon and rock him at the last minute..Nate you are a BUMB
You guys think he’s gnna killed in there? Have y’all seen some of the shots he’s taken? 🤣🤣 i think worst case scenario, it ends the way diaz and masvidal did. That doesn’t mean he’s gnna get killed. He’ll just bleed too much. He’s gnna clip khamzat a few times, attempt and come close to a submission when he baits khamzat to the ground. That’s about it. Loss by decision or doctor’s stoppage. This dude doesn’t get knocked out. Y’all need to understand that. Rock him with a hammer at full force to the jaw, he’ll just spit blood at you and stick up his middle fingers and keep walking forward.
Real talk coming...... If your the greatest fighter to step into the octogon.... Why never been a champion!!!! Why u 21-13, Khabib is 29-0, then unfortunately there's Jon Jones, Conor who shaped the UFC to be what it is today.... The list can go on....
23:37 *Facts.*
Cumshot Chimney doesn’t know Nate is BUILT DIFFERENT 💪😤💯
Feels like the man know hes at a cross road in his life.
Nate isn't a well spoken marketable company's pet which is why he's disregarded. Which makes no sense considering this is the fight game. But the industry wants the clean cut polo shirt preppy boys like Mcgregor, Porier and, Anthony Joshua.
12:50goat lines
Always loved the Diaz brothers and always will. War Nate!
Great mindset
Nates only 35 quit acting like hes done. Nate is at the peak of his prime right now Stockton Slap.
If nate wasnt a fighter he'd be a bagger at walmart
Love Nate Diaz always been a fan of the fighter but also the person the ufc did him wrong asf and it's sad to see when u got guys like Connor who hasn't won a real fight in yrs and there still paying him millions when he wants to get in there lose its just sad
Nate will remain one of the goats
EPIC Let's go. Awesome half time show.
Greatest interview of all time!! I love Nathan but I couldn’t stop laughing
Dammit love this dude. Lol @ the way he ended the interview
You know what's fascinating?  Everyone says he's like a gangster, but he's never seen himself as a gangster
Just remember conor was supposed to smash nate the 1st time around. Not saying it will but its not impossible just saying
209! REPRESENT!  LET'S GET IT NATHAN! 👊
I’ll fight all of them in 5 seconds 🔥🤍
Nates nothing but heart
Nate Diaz by 4th round SUBMISSION!!!! 🥷
this video pixelated for anyone else?
I know people like cocaine
Im not surprised mfkrs
I’m definitely thinking khazmat wins but I hope Nate has moments and this is 5 rounds to test khazmat cardio too
15:10 why does Nate seem scared
The respect I have for this man, a man who I have never met, is out of this world.  This dude is one of my heroes, and he deserves it all.  Not because he is or was the best fighter, or the champ or anything like that.. because he was REAL.  He is who he is and nothing ever changed him.  I went out of my way to buy tickets for UFC 279 and a very expensive hotel room in Vegas just to watch this man.  The truth is, even if the fight is over quick (I dont think it will be) it doesn't matter, Im there to see Nate, even if its just for a second.  I could not go through life without saying that I saw this man in person, in the octagon.  To say im excited is def an understatement and I cant fckkking wait!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣bro you higher than a mofo
LFG Nate!!!!!!
Nate’s fans: They did him wrong giving him such a strong opponent!!! Nate’s a killer, they should’ve given him a broken opponent that can’t win so Nate still looks good!!!! 😭😭😭
Bro i dont wanna be mean but i feel like Khamzat gonna murder this dude ....
in the beginning of the interview Brett looked to have a mullet from the furniture in the background. And it looks normal lol.
This brain has to be donated for research
this was some great insight.
Wow how
Not mental fit... Sorry but its truth
Nate, nobody like him
Who a better interview Nate Diaz or Luke rockhold.? Interesting
Nate vs Tony was the fight to make, fck Dana and UFC ..
Ah, ESPN MMA, still can't get the audio normalization right.
This was great
"Smoke weed every day"
Nate Diaz  the Arturo Gatti of mma .....win lose or draw his fans remain loyal. We just want to see him fight.
Should’ve been him n Ferguson raza vs raza 🇲🇽ufc is Bit** for this fight against cumshot trash
Can not wait to see this guy get retired... So tired of hearing the Diaz sisters whine about everything.
“You do steroids & I’ll smoke weed let’s get it on & sqwab!!”-  the Peoples Champion
The ending 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
I don’t think he knows what he’s talking about in this interview. Khamzat by 1st round tko, Nate may die.
Can we please get this dude to stop interviewing fighters. He is trash and doesn't know how to pull or get conversations goinf
Billion dollar company putting out 720p content. Nice
Nate's a legend,, he's damaged,,too much weed and too many blows to the head,, he's not gonna go down easy to Khamzat
Looks defeated already 😫
Nate gave definition of gangsta do the thing at his own terns... He said right people like Khamzat need permission from UFC to do things that's call puppet not gangsta
“If you’re Mr. G.O.A.T , go make a G.O.A.T”
Watch chimaev get tired and get choked out
I need subtitles
Nate Diaz the legend, win or lose, he will remain a star , sad to know this might be his last fight in the UFC, they needed to sign a one fight extension for Diaz, needed to see Diaz McGregor 3 next year at international fight week 😔
Is always hard to understand where Diaz is going with his ideas. But it ain’t matter! We all like the guy, we will always make time to go and see him fight because he is really tough and goes in with no agenda or else. He is there to take the W every time!
Let's go Nate
It's so enjoyable to listen to how delusional this guy is.
Straight Stockton FIRE!
I've been folowing both fighters from the begining Both r my favorite Against the ods ,  Still b loyal for life For nate "buldog" diaz
Love you Nate! No matter the outcome this weekend it’s going to be a fun fight. And don’t forget- Heroes get remembered, But legends never die!
Stockton mf !!!!!
One of the worst MMA journalist interviewing Diaz for 30min+ before a huuuuge fight. What a shame. ESPN could hire sooo much better
Unlimited respect forever for this man, doing the hardest job on his own terms. I hope it goes the distance and he beats Khamzat in decision, I think it will be great for both of them.
If Nate Diaz really does retire, the UFC is going to feel more empty.
i love how his most famous actors are robert deniro and adam sandler hahaha
Nate peoples champ let’s go Nate
"sneak steroidin" & "i smoke weed, you do steroids lets get in there and scrap" have me dying
The last minutes was the best... 31:50  You see at heart he knows what the people actually want, an get to see in his head for a second towards the end   Nate: I REFUSE TO BE LAME.
Nick Diaz Army MF!!!
Bro nate is a crackhead
Diaz is absolutely 100% delusional.
Nate’s nickname his entire career should have been “The Gangster”
nates adoration  for his brother genuinely  gives me hope for humanity.  f*** khamzat and f*** the Disney sh!! show that is the ufc atm
Nate makes very valid points. He deserves whatever fight he wants, not to be used as a prop piece. What a legend. Glad to have witnessed a least a piece of his epic career.
Nate just made the current champ walk like a zombie on his last fast!! He should post a picture wt him pointing to Edwards saying.. look at me now 😂😂😂
Finding out that Nate didn’t ask for this and still doesn’t want this fight. Changes the feel. Sorry Nate
The fact they didn't put subtitles is an insult can barely understand the dude
Dude! How are people not worried about Nates brain? Listen to him talk! He hardly makes sense. You can ask this man what he had for breakfast, and be subjected to a twenty minute monolog going from his childhood to the moonlanding to who know what.
this video quality is so terrible... love me some nate but cmon folks its 2022
Anyone think Nate’s took a few to many slaps.
Glad to hear that Nate would consider resigning with a W here, would legitimately have a title shot in line against Leon if he could pull it off
This looks like a therapy session
Crème de la crème 😂😂😂😂😂
If Nate wins, it’ll be greatest future champ shutdown in UFC history
Sounds like Nate’s gonna stay with ufc.
CUMSHOT HASNT FOUGHT ANYONE LIKE HE SAID BUT COSTA, A JUICED OUT JIU-JITSU GUY,  CUMSHOTS IN FOR A SURPRISE
One of the funniest interviews ever
This guy takes too much beating every fight and that has an effect,so why have him fight this young guy who's gonna again give him a beating it's not fair the UFC wants to kill this guy
I like Khamzat but win or lose Nate will always be a legend. A true badass.
My god watching this man speak his native tongue is the most painful thing on the planet
wish this could of been longer , you are the goat nate , lets shock the world one more time
Diaz Diaz Diaz Diaz my heart scream
A part of me wishes Nate gives up soon as the fight start and mess up the entire event for the UFC and walks out.
If Nate isn't crowned Hall of fame, I'll never watch ufc again
If your a goat then make a goat - Nate Diaz 2022
As someone who used to smoke weed all day, everyday, I can safely say that Nate is all jacked up from too much weed
Just a real dude
My money is on Nate. Buster Douglas beat an unbeatable Tyson because he had more reasons to win
Dang he wanted to fight Tony.. that would've been a banger of a fight! 🔥🔥
Can’t believe he said he was trying to fight Tony, why didn’t the ufc make that it was so perfect for both guys. Ufc doing them both so dirty.
Pulver shout out let's go!
The people’s champion Nate Diaz
"Why don't you go work on a computer then you nerd?" Nate, what did I do to you?? 🤣
Nate, you are the best. Don't worry for half a minute about the garbage politics. YOU alone, showed us what courage and confidence looks like, and what a great fighter looks like, in REAL life. Break Chim's arm.
This felt more like a therapy session. Nate getting everything off his chest while the therapist sat and listened 😂
Very apparent brain damage.
THIS INTERVIEW FROM NATE IS WAY DEEPER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE... Respect 🤘🏾
Nate been fighting everybody for 15+ years and they still don’t respect him
Nate Diaz is a different kind of monster. We love Stockton Zombie.
NDA 👊🏽
"" If u a goat.   Make a goat "' "Legendary quote"
I SEE NATE AND I CLICK..
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this just pure Gibberish ?
Controlling the narrative is what its called Nathan
Such a legend. Hope he enjoys his hard earned retirement
Idc how crazy he sounds sometimes he makes me wanna fight and that’s what real fighters do.
English Subs please
why is nate complaining instead of seeing this as a big fight, there's a lot of people watching khamzat as well, he doesn't realise that, he feels he is carrying the card.
Nate makes a great case about fighting in the top ten for a long time while others come and go.  Further, without having UFC promo machine behind him and still becoming one of the most popular UFC/MMA fighters ever in the game.  I hope he wins.  Edit:. I remember when Dana said "Nate doesn't move the needle"
Feel bad for Nate…. Brain isn’t the best
He’s borderline brain dead and already lost in his own mind. I’ll enjoy seeing the retirement ceremony on Saturday.
Love Nate.....
Nate and Nick for starters live and move on a whole different code!! They're true to themselves and are completely Free,I RESPECT them and their mentality so much.. win lose or draw . It's Nate Diaz army till the wheels fall off
Nate: tells Bret that fight week feels the same like 20 times Bret: “So it all feels the same??”
The fact that everyone is saying he asked for this while he clearly says here 12:45 that he didn't shows you how insane of a manipulator dana is... he got everyone thinking nate wanted this fight yall just dumb af
20:01 really said that lol 😂...N word passive
The best loser I've ever watched
Nate smokes too much and acts like he has been snorting 6 years
The greatest actors of all time, Pacino, De Niro, DiCaprio..... Sandler 😂😂
Lmao Nate does a Usman impression
cmon you couldnt get 1080p?
Your first and most dangerous opponent is your own mind.
Hope Nate wins
The real OG of the fight game Nate Diaz 💪
The older he gets the more he looks like his big brother. May the best man win and respect to both fighters it is going to be a good competition.
Dana did him dirty... ☹️
This guy has some problems with his own or personal life or maybe something like depression. He doesn’t look normal
You have to respect UFC for never trying to censor or silent fighters. Fighters can say whatever they want without any fines or repercussions
Ma a real gangsta I will cry when you leave
Whatever the outcome, it is what it is but Diaz will forever be a legend and a warrior in my eyes, praying he gets the upset that would be incredible 💯👌 🙏
Am I the only one that thinks Brett ir terrible at this lmaoo
best nate interview ever by far - he is also “more” coherent here
That's just gold right there and I hope nate doesn't take any real damage 🙏
209
BMF alive 🤜🤛
For a second I didn’t think he was saying none then he said “the champions fighting who they tell them to fight” Nate been fighting who he wants to fight when he wants to fight, he’s the peoples champ
The quality is not that good. I don't know what theyre doing with their cameras, but they need to render it differently.
I’m genuinely hyped for this fight. I wish Nate all the best from the UK!
Goat? 21w' 13L's R U Kidding...
Where subtitles? Don’t understand
Love nate but he should be focused on the fight not moaning on what's right or what's wrong 💯  and that's me just being real
CTE ON FULL SHOW
I just like watching him fight. I can't be arsed deciphering nates language for 20 mins.
"I am not surprised mothers fuckers" pt2 coming this weekend. Show'em what that west coast like.
Champion is a mindset 🙏 Nates ready as ever.
Too much censoring.
Real G! 🫡
"You do steroids and I'll smoke weed and let's get in there and squab"... That needs to be on a shirt
You do steroids. We I’ll smoke weed. Let’s get in and fight
"It don't feel right if its not happening "  ....warriors are meant to fight.
Nate did make a lot of interesting  points about his perspective. I'll be a fan for life.
If you the goat then make a goat “
This may be my favorite Nate interview yet… the last 25 minutes are unreal. Nice job Bret
UFC 5 NATE DIAZ ON THE COVER WITH NICK STOP PLAYIN
Is it just me or dose Bret look like he’s about to star in a porno?
Keep in mind guys, that if any Nates fight would go over 5 rounds...ques whos the winner would be?
“ you do steroids I’ll smoke weed and let’s squab “
Guys a legend and as real as it gets but he gets mauled in 1 round sadly
Diaz gets cut in first round and doctor stoppage in second round while Chimaev is gassing out in corner.
Delusional
i love nate! true warrior of mma
Nothing about his record is legendary. Had some good wins; had a lot of one sided losses. His attitude is more well known than what he’s actually done in the octagon. Won the Ultimate Fighter cause Manny’s shoulder popped. Conor is his biggest win, followed by losing to Conor. Legend is a stretch.
No captions available for the video??? Kaaaaay.
Khabib understand the game he's genius beside he's the goat cuz he don't give the ufc the chance to control his career and diaz make that point: they call you beast until they find an other and feed you to him with disrespect because of money not because they love him than it's his turn and the chain turn again and again like this
Nate forever
I would actually love to see Diaz vs Usman.
This basically a Nate therapy session, and it’s incredible. Dude’s a savant🐐
I like Khamzat but we’ve seen a lot of upsets in the UFC over the last year and I’ll never bet against either Diaz brother. There are few fighters who actually walk the walk instead just talk and the Diaz brothers are the top 2 on that list.
Nah Nate, you have folks who still support you Homie
Khamzat's fans: "He is going to OBLITERATE Diaz. Easy win, hands down."  Nate'a fans: "Win or lose, we will always love him."  Lmao you can really tell who the confident ones are.
DO YOU THINK NATE WILL EVER WEAR A YELLOW OR BLUE T-SHIRT
Что они там
Was this recorded with a brick? lol
Part of me feels Nate Diaz, and the other part of me thinks he’s just delusional and off the CTE.
Nate should fight Conor and cash out big time !!!! not Khamzat -.- Nate deserve big payday
he tries to hard to be cool. or nonchalant it’s lame
UFC has always treated the Diaz brothers poorly bc they won't run with the UFC script. Been using Nate as a gatekeeper for a long time.
This is the most comfortable I have seen Nate in a interview, team Nate here and always will  Man I hope you beat this beast
This level of linguistic ability still beats mine
🐐
I love Nate….I think we all admire his never die, never quit spirit he always brings to his fights. But he looks like such a stoner lol💨 he always looks like he’s high on all kind of drugs😂 not a good look. Plus it would be nice for him to actually learn some defence instead of using his face to block punches, yeah he’s tough, yes we admire it….but he don’t need to take so much damage and would probably beat most people through hart alone if he learned that. I want him to win, I hope he wins….but honestly toughness is not enough…you need to work on your all round game bro, your not the best striker, wrestler or have the best defence.
Nate nearly opened up a cut just rubbing his face.
Diaz Army MFs 💪🏼💪🏼
“Im willing to fight niggas on steroids.” Nate will always have my respect ..
If ufc competitors had to cross the scale going into the Octagon then Nate wouldv prob already been a champ at 55 or 70 and Khamzat would be at 185 or 205
As a black man when Nate said...."Ill fight niggas on steroids and Ill smoke my weed and we can squab".....I felt that. If you listen long enough, you'll see his strategy for having longevity as a fighter in the UFC. I hope Nate wins real talk.
Где субтитры? Там на камеру снимают размером с дом, а качество только 720. ЮФС, вы шо, гоните?
I understand what this guy is saying but I don’t understand what this guy is saying
Nate never being champ is a shame. He was my champ after he beat Connor.
STOCKTON MOTHERFUCKRR !!! Come on Nate!!!!
Loll khamzat is scary man you can tell
Stockton, Ca, MUTHAFKRS!!!!!
The UFC has messed with the Diaz bros but they have let themselves be messed with with their lack of thinking ability.
This is the best showing of this man I've ever seen. Shame it took this long.
Nate genuinely believes he is the only person taking tough fights, and that level of self belief/delusion is admirable.
Nate is straight hood!!! I hope he derailed the UFC golden goose on his way out!!!
I want to watch these interviews but for the love of god get someone barely decent, not this guy... Or upload a version where you just mute okamoto's parts, Im sure your views will sky rocket!
Always F*CKing Kept It Real 💯
Great to hear Nate say, "With high moments you can expect low moments and with low moments you can expect high moments." Checks out
Great interview. I just realized how difficult is it for the cameraman to focus on Nate as he keeps moving around.
The realist in the game period
Long interview! Thought Nate would start bleeding
Is this recorded with a potato??
CTE
“This was a great Interview Bret. I have to go”
Good luck Nate, I hope you don’t take but give lots of punishment
NATE DIAZ I Would Never Count Nate Diaz Out, Nate Wins 🏆 Regardless of Score Cards or Whatever Nates The Winner SLAP! Four Letters in Nate Four Letters in NEXT!
Shoutout to the cameraman who had to be on point throughout as Nate bobbed and weaved his way thru out the interview/monologue. Nate calls the shots as usual
Khamzat Chimaev BORZ number one 👍
Nate makes me feel so nervous. His CTE is bad. Dude sounds like Chuck Liddell now.
I like the way he left the interview legendary
nate diaz is coming to fight every time never a doubt.
It's sad that this may be Nates last ufc fight week.
Nate Diaz talks like a guy who has had 3 strokes. I cant wait for Khamzat to hurt him badly
The UFC is such a greedy company. The #1 disgusting thing they did is take away fighter walk out gear. Fighters use to make bank from that. Just another company abusing people.
“You do steroids, I’ll smoke weed, let’s get in there and squash”…legendary!
why is this video only 720p SMFH
Love Nate But why does it sound like it hurts him to talk.
209 MF!!!
Great interview Brad!
Nate by submission fucc it I said it idc how crazy it sounds 😂😂😂
Awesome job not interrupting him and letting him speak!
5:09 Nate feels sorry for himself. 😭 He is gonna get some shots. Big shots
Tbh dana wouldn’t do this with conor or masvidal cause they are ‘stars’ but nate is getting this treatment cause he aint danas b*tch and licking his shoe
Nick and Nate Diaz
Nate is the GOAT no matter what!!!!
He always talks like he is stoned, but in this interview his eyes look so stoned!
Bmf diaz brother's
20:00 The fact that he’s so serious about that… Diaz Army 💪🏾
Fun fact 🛑 You will enjoy and understand Nate’s interview better if you’re high😹  try it next time if we ever see this legend again after this fight 🛑
Nate said Niqqa
Is it me or does Nick sound better with his words
Nate the real Gangster
I love me some Nate Diaz
Man I hope Nate wins. Would be epic
It wouldn't be the first time Nate finish the hype guy
OOPPSS..."it's what I knew" in the first 40 seconds he showed his cards...sorry Nate u deserved better bro...smh...
Nate referring to his upcoming opponent as "Whats his name" is a pretty bad sign
Parkinsons disease incoming
Dam I can't stand seeing Nate like this... Nate doesn't deserve to be going thru what he's currently going through & having to feel the way he does. He's done sooo much for the UFC over the years. I really hope he comes in and KNOCKS Khamzat TF out!. UFC you should be treating & showing Nate much more respect/love. Don't forget the fighters that made you who you are & got the UFC to where it's at!.
Living Legend! 💯 watching him, got me in to MMA and it truly ‘saved me’ living the Martial arts way got me away from all the toxicity the world had to offer! We appreciate you and Nick!! Legends! 💯
I think he knows he's lost this one, but like any fight Nate won't back down. Isn't ready to quit, probably knows he'd never be now's the time to make a change.
I'm not suprised Mother Hubbard! 👊
“Adesanya, uh, NI-Ganou” 👀👱🏿‍♂️😂😂
Does he realize he hasn’t won a fight in forever lmfao
This is another guy who gets big fights that he hasn't earned. Look at his record. He's only won 4 of his last 10 fights going back to 2012. Hasn't fought now in 15 months. Lost his last two. Hasn't won a fight in three years. White padded his bank account now he fights when he wants. He's turned into his brother. Sits around smoking dope and then makes himself visible when the bank account is getting low. Look at all the guys who are fighting for a living and are starving who earned the fight with Chimaev. Chimaev is ranked number 3 ( Unbeaten, 11 wins zero losses )  and Diaz isn't ranked at all, he's literally out of the picture. Now Diaz gets to fight Khamzat? I like Nate he's an awesome dude but I hope he gets smashed bad in this one.
720p? ESPN come on
Good luck kid 👍🏼 I'm khamzat all the way Nate is a true warrior tho 🤷🏼‍♂️
Nate is delusional. He’s a fun fighter to watch, but never even really a top 10 fighter. Connor made him a superstar
Nate's passed off hard Khamzat better not sleep on diaz because nate diaz is a hard fuckn fight when he's passed off. All I'm saying is I wouldnt be surprised if nate gets him in 4th or 5th round with this chip on his shoulder. Let's go diaz 👊
Goat
Love mate but he's hard to listen to
If Nate wins the Conor trilogy would be the biggest fight of all time
17:09 Nate diaz is the goat bro
Please god LET NATE WIN!!!! 🙏
Real
Natedog... you can save that brain now and build something great in a different arena. Nothing left to prove to anyone. Time to work smarter not harder
The video quality is trash. do better ESPN
Is about taking Khamsat to the top and letting Nate go but first use him as a ladder for respect which he'll never be a Nate or Nick. I do know Dana knows that Nate could knock Khamsat TFOout no doubt or submit him. Boy wouldn't that be an upset
Nate scared
This man is a legend 💥
Nate is a Dog, I want him to Win, it would be more amazing then Leon Beating Kushman.  Ps. Respect to Nate for Remember the actual legends, like Fedor  BJ, And Gracias.  Nobody tells Nate what to do, he ends the interview when he wants it  not when it's over.  🤣 What a legend!
Nate is a legend, simple as that
I think you probably need to get high to get what he says
Nate is the champ, f ur opinion!
His last fight should be mcgregror , that would be a right way to send off Nate
Nate's interviews are always pure gold. We all want to be a bit like Nate lol
This man already got CTE literally, he can barley speak 😪
I didn’t understand anything 😂😂😂😂
Let’s go Nate!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nate Diaz army mf
Homeboy must of smoked a fat one before this interview🤙🏽
Brett looks like an alcoholic wife beat”er
“You do steroids, I’ll smoke weed and lets get in there” Nate is the baddest of the sport.
I love that Steven A. Smith does the sign off of an MMA video
NATE DIAZ ARMY 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
37 year oold Nate vs 28-year-old khamzat in hjes prime i hope Nate gets this one last win :(
Its not Nate Diaz vs whoever the f*** this person is 😂 classic Nate.
@natediaz209
🐐
😄😄 this wasn't an interview - it was a conversation with Nate venting away to Brett.  Even ended it off himself and walked out.  👏👏
This was gold.
Nate, Keep's it Real!!!
i love Nate
This fight is about making this guy…. Wow so true!
That left eye is ready to bleeding
Absolute legend of this sport
I hope nate wins his fight ,because if he does the ufc will be swinging from Nates nuts ..good luck ...
Love Nate but man it’s hard to listen to him talk 😭
Nate wins , 2nd round submission
Rory Macdonald rematch 👀
Nick and Nate Diaz army MFs
We love you Nate! You’ll always be #1 brotha!
16:05 its nate vs everybodyy
Dude keeps it 💯… no bs out his mouth.
Lemme ask u the same 5 questions. TFOH go Nate I love the 🐺 but can’t
I love Nate Diaz....soldier
"this is my halftime show"  - Love it !!!!
Nate is a national treasure.
Ey yo Nate, you good bro? 😂😂
It’s funny our censorship, Nate is about to go to war but we gotta censor his “bad” words lol so backwards. Half this video is censored lol
Brett is easily the best interviewer in the UFC.
This feels like a therapy session 😂😂
He’s emotionally projecting, as he just took the fight out of fear and pride. They sending him to the Wolfe. He deserves a fight with Jake Paul.
The man honestly just wants a bit of respect..   The modern state of mma fans has people demanding guys like khabib goat cause he won 13 ufc fights meanwhile in the exact same division you got guys like Tony or Charles who had 11 or 12 fight streaks getting called journeyman bums lol.. khabib won the beat by beating a late notice 11th ranked iquinta imagine nate or Tony getting a opportunity  like that.
if nate fought 30 more times losing all 30 i'd still root for him in all 30 fights
Nate's an absolute "G" in the game. # PERIOD
Nate diaz - if you took a waxwork of ben afflecks face and melted it in the sun
They gonna try rippin their heads off but God forbid he says a bad word.  Don't censor, especially that Man. Let him say it how he feels to say it.
Win win situation for Nate tbh if he loses he was supposed to lose and he’ll move on to the next chapter in his life. But if he beats or even kos khamzat? Ooof Nate will skyrocket even more than he is already.
For some reason I feel like Nate is going to walk in there and soon as the bell rings he gonna tap and flip off Dana Whote and walk out lol 😂
He's a lost brother to Mike Tyson. Both have taken too much to speak normally. I hope he can stay in the fight for all 5 rounds.
Nate’s eyes gonna get cut and bleed in the 1st round and the fights gonna be called by 3rd
Bellator or One will throw alot of money at Nate. Go get your money, Nate
Whenever i see nate i remember tuco salamanca
My money’s on Nate. Let’s go champ 💪🏻
Ariel is the only one qualified to interview/translate for the diaz bros
Big fan of nick and Nate but the excuses get tiring
Bro asked for Israel Adesanya or Francis ngannou I think Khamzat Chimaev is a mercy compared to those guys
Never rule nate out. Even tho masvidal won he is the real BMF
lets go nate we love you
No Oliveira is the best because he beat them all
This video needs subtitles
Bret didn't interview Nate. Nate interviewed Nate lol.
GO NATE! 🤜🏽💥
He almost beat the champion.
He desperately needs therapy.
He doesn't even know khamzats name. "Whatever the fk his name is" I don't think Nate said his name once
true legend of this fight game ❤️
Nate was high af ahhahahha "la crème de la crème"
R E S P E C T ××× N A T E D I A Z
I keep reading comments but if Leon can sleep Usman nick can win this fight. If he loses it will be Dr stoppage or he gets out to sleep which I don’t see happening.
one thing about nate he dont give up never count this underdog out we can win some moneyyyyyyy
AUDIO SUX ON THIS VIDEO COME ON ESPN
Fador malenko lol
This is like a movie
Man that thumbnail got my boy nate looking like a cane Toad
12:35 🤣📈
Brett you GOTTA get better at reading your interviewees & setting them up better
Nate is as genuine as you can get. I like both Fighters, so this fight will be hard to watch in many respects, but there will Never be another fighter like Nate in the ufc. Respect. 👊👊
Nate is the most loyal homie u could ask for
Win lose or draw we ride with Diaz
"One and only" is redundant, would be better if it said, The Only.
Usman has a bro Nathan to😂
Nate wearing his sunglasses on the back of his head so nobody can sneak up on him
" he does have a point. he is the best in the UFC
Nate's impression of Usman 😭
He got maximum head trauma, he can barely talk
signs of weed toxicity and mental retardation is clear on Nate I like the guy but unfortunately weed causes cognitive delusions and disabilities
Can see how annoyed he is at being stuck in his contract and not feeling the recognition he deserves.
Listening to Nate talk is like listening to my old grandfather talk while he floats in and out of consciousness while only managing to string together a few words that make sense here and there. I just nod my head out of respect, but I have no clue what he’s talking about.
This interview sucks it’s prime time and you get an extra carful of what you say Nate and that’s not him he swears to much and it’s hard for him to keep it espn worthy
it is sad that the UFC has to try and destroy fighters who don't want to fight for them.  If the UFC worked with Diaz and let him take some boxing matches he most likely would be still fighting for the UFC after this fight.  If this wasn't Nate's last fight, who do you think the UFC would offer?  I would tell you it wouldn't be a 185 lber who is considered a very big for welterweight.
Lemme say you this, its not the first time Nate shook the world!
Nate ends up getting signed by the UFC again. No doubt.
How can you not love Diaz!
How could anyone think this makes Nate look good?  He sounds like a 70 yo mentally ill homeless man.
Nate Diaz fight week feels special. He always comes to win. Feels like a belt is on the line.
He's never managed to get that frog out of his throat. He does a throat clear often and it never does the trick cause he doesn't do it hard enough. I feel frustrated for him
Free agent Nate will be dope
absolute legend
He sounds like Mike Tyson!!
6th round Nate Diaz
Классный чел Нейт. Привет из УКРАИНЫ !!!!!!!!!!
Nate’s my favorite of all time. This is emotional to watch, realizing this is probably his last fight in the UFC. I want him to win so bad, but Khamzat is scary af. Praying for a shocker 🙏🏻
Was he close to crying a few times? His voice Trimble a few times
Goat 🐐 Diaz
Nate thinks he's alone. His not, all true mma fans stand behind this man, the realest man in the company!!
Kill Or Be Killed Team Diaz 💪🏾
He too real for the UFC
Nate is so real
Legend 💪
Nate you’re my champion
You can see he’s nervous this time.
I'll never count Nate out.
He sounds and looks very depressed.  He sounds sick of life.  I really hope he pulls the win out of this but goin off this interview I don't know
You can see the struggle and frustration in Nate’s head to get his thoughts across but he doesn’t have the vocabulary to express himself in many words
Il be honest,  I wish it was Ferguson Nate was fighting
Nate being his delusional self😂😂😂
I know he don’t need my respect but he has it. I’m a fan
Fadora-Mehlinko one my favorite fighters of all-time. EZ
" I refuse to be lame !" 👑💥🙏
Sacrificial Lamb. Nate deserves to be looker after and taken care of better than this. You know he ain't ever going to back down
I Just hope he wins and flips everyone off
Nate wouldn’t resign unless all his homies got contracts that’s real asf
Crazy how Nate went from being booed for being himself earlier in his career to being absolutely loved now for it. The right matchmaking makes the star shine brighter.
you gotta love nate diaz, thank for everything and i'm sure that his last fight is gonna be amazing, whether win or lose, PS: you guys need to post these videos with better video quality tho
its so hard to hear this dude speak.
I love Nate, I will always put my money on you Nate, you are 💯 always win or not I'm always with you.
The OG of the fight game!
It wouldn't be a Nate Diaz interview without some delusion. Love it! Nate and Chael should have their own sitcom.
That was a great interview cuz Brad was smart enough to be quiet and let Nate talk smart interviewer
Nate just Ranted for 30 minutes and dipped. Legend
Without a championship fight he has headlined 4/5 cards🙏🙏🙏
Man I feel his angst!!
21:30 makes me tear up. The Love.
"I never asked the UFC for anything, I demanded and took what I'm gonna take." -Nate Diaz 2022
Nate is so thick he’s literally a cave man
20:00 "Nigganou, Francis Nigganou"
It's sad that after everything UFC wouldn't just give Nate a fight he wanted. He basically made Conor & Masvidal superstars and sold ton's of ppv's for them. Both Diaz's made the UFC good money.
Nate is the Allen Iverson of MMA 🐐
Champion of the whole UFC is a bit of a stretch my dude.
He reminds me of Mike tyson In a way.
“This was a great interview Brett, I have to go” lol
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Audio engineers save lives. Remember to turn down your volume after watching!
I know I'm in vegas with my girl and betting big on Nate (American gangster)
Most interesting incoherent person I’ve listened to
There will never be another Nate Diaz!! Win lose or draw I'm always rocking with Nate! This isn't the best situation for Nate but if there is anyone who can pull this off it's Nate! I won't be SURPRISED MFS!!!
Nate vs nganu would be rad
Nate might break Chimaev's arm.
I think he is gonna win. to easy
Something doesn’t feel right about this fight…
LMAOOO DIAZ IS SO REAL
I think he’s been hit in the head too many times
12:37 there's levels.
I imagine this is the part of the job Nate really doesn't enjoy. Answering the same old questions over and over.   Love training , fighting. Hates promo.
Never underestimate the Diaz Brothers; they are fearless and could just pull a win from the last second.
Need English subtitles with this guy
14:00 isn’t time Ive seen Nate almost get emotional
209 till ufc dies
Legend!!
Nate’s logic is so screwed 🤣
When him and his bro are out and about in Stockton, you'd think it was Ali walking through Zaire again! I will guarantee one thing, he'll be bleedin' heavy by the 1st Rd!
Nate is incredibly delusional lmao
No. I don’t know what your saying?????
what's with the video quality?
Nate's right about the respect thing, everybody is focused on trying to make a name off of a name instead of showing reverence for the guys who inspired them to fight in the first place. They should build their own legacy without trying to piggyback off of a legend.
NDA 209 KILL OR BE KILLED
I wish brett didnt fuckung suck
I’m from the 209 grew up off the diaz brothers got into Muay Thai awhile ago. Trained with some of his boys and he ain’t lying when he said “that’s how he would do it and him.” When referring to his homeboys. They are warriors haha. Nate diaz did so much for the ufc but honestly I’m happy his contract is coming to an end the ufc doesn’t appreciate him or his brother nick. Can’t wait for him to start a new chapter and make even bigger bucks that he deserves. There will never be another diaz brothers ever. A lot of people are scared of khamzat ducking him, but Nate diaz is a gangsta. In a recent interview I think on Ariel halwanis show he says “I know it’s a bad match up for me, but F IT I’m a fighter it’s what I do.” Such a G
Pretty cool interview.
My favorite thing about this interview is that Nate doesn’t know how to pronounce Khamzat’s name
It's good to fall asleep
💪💪💪 come on Nate get it done man!!!!
He lives in his own world of dreams where he is the champion.
nate is 1000% right that’s why he’s the goat
Tell me nate don't give you mike tyson vibes
Real UFC fans not counting Nate out by any means
Last GOAT Champ in the UFC was Mighty Mouse.
720? ESPN come on
Man has cte, love his fighting style but man does it come at a cost that's sad to see
If Nate Diaz ain't the best, then why they tryna build Chimaev off him ?
Great guy but he needs to get off the drugs, dope is destroying his thinking capacity.  He's like the stoned lovechild of Channing Tarum & Mark Whalberg.
I love how Nate says when the interview is done hahaha he's  G
Why are these so low quality?
?
I’ve never pulled for a fighter more to win then Nate Diaz....UFC should be ashamed of themselves, but their to big to even realize what there doing to what got them to this spot in first place.
Is it just me or does Brett Okamoto not cut it? His interview style is awkward and he seems to always get stuff wrong? Stutters and stumbles a lot? Idk he’s just not my cup of tea.
This therapy session was needed.
‘So why khamzat’ Nate- f that, do you know when you walk into the mall and you see Robert deniro…. 😂😂
NATE DONT GIVE F*CK!
You go get em NATE!!!! time for a good ol fashion DIAZ BEAT DOWN!!!! Man trying to taint your legacy!! Ain't gonna happen your a champ and always will be can't take that from you EVER!!!!
We need the uncensored version
This guy deserve a guard of honour. You can  hear the emotion in his voice. Love Nate and massive respect for what he has done.
STOP DOING DRUGS lol
Props to Brett, he always gets a good interview out of Nate, seems like Nates likes/trusts him and opens up a bit.
♥️😆✊✊✊💯💯💯🥷🏻 🥷🏻
Fight doesn't last 2 rounds.  Khamzat will walk through him.  Diaz it's been fun
Nate is a straight up G and he's been such a huge inspiration. He's the man.
Nate is scared, look at the guy. We will probably see the 1st death inside the octagon. Easy Chimaev win.
Legend ✊🏼
Nate Diaz is going to shock the world. Don't be surprised motherfuckers!
I love how Nate ended the interview 😂 legend fr
💪🏽💪🏽209 mf! 💯✊🏽✊🏽
Love Nate and khamzat I hung out with Nate and he was the coolest generous famous person I've met.  I wish him everything that's good and deserves to be in the ufc hall of fame for what he has done for the ufc
The idiot can barely string a sentence together 🙄
He’s gonna have real bad cte
Nate I like you… but my IQ is down a bit after listen to you for 20 min
Nothing is more cringe worthy than watching a Nate Diaz interview The dude literally can barely put a sentence together he sounds so uneducated when he talks
All love to nate “realest” man in the ufc
Very sad see some fighter like this and all of as can see clearly the inhappeness inside evry word
Here for the culture
Dam nate needs to stop smoking meth
This is really sad we need to boycott ufc sad how they are feeding Nate to khamzat and then dropping him
Never know what Nate’s talking about but I still love his interviews you got this bruv!!!
Where's Stipe to translate this nonsense for me.
I hope Nate get the upset and rides off into the sunset.
One of the most entertaining fighters ever.
After hundreds of years later people will still remember the name likes Muhammad ali ,Mike Tyson,LeBron James, Lionel Messi,Floyd Mayweather and Nate diaz..don't get me wrong
Whhaaaaahhhh??? Delusional
Nate dropped some bombs here
How could anyone like this guy lol. His fighting style is fun  But outside of that.... I can barely understand him. It's cute that he thinks he's the greatest fighter who ever stepped foot in the octagon.. its great to have confidence in anything you do. But thats a laughable delusion.
i refuse to be lame lmaooooooooo
I don’t follow his reasonings and logic. But I F’n love Nate Diazzzz. Dude beats Chimaev and I’m on cloud 9.
I feel like nate vibes more when Ariel interviews him
Ariel not doing this with Nate doesn’t feel right
Let's go Nate!
Nate Diaz is right. The UFC hypes up some of these champions so much that that we forget the fact they haven't faced   even half of the top ten fighters in their respective division.....
Nate got too many punches against his head
Chimaev isn’t a fan of Nate he just says that to get Nate fans after this if he wins he knows this his biggest money fight even tho burns was #3 ranked. I’m ready for this fight tho 💪. The rest of the card is garbage
You have just watched the greatest MMA interview of all time. And I hope your realize it. Nobody knows the business like Nate.
What the ufc don’t understand the Diaz brothers brought the culture to the arena that’s what made em them from Chicano to Mexican to black they represent all that from the streets the struggles and humble
I'd love to see Nathan starch Khamzat
The always real, Nate Diaz.
Win or lose he’s still the baddest mf on the planet
Nate has some serious brain damage.
Nate diaz real gangster 🤘
29:25 lmao
Chimaev 2nd round TKO it's not gonna be pretty
1 min in..fk brt okmota..hes spoiling the vibe..
This guy is on heavy drugs 😂
Fedormalenko
Nate got me tearin up here 😥 go out on a high g 😤✌🏾
What is he babbling about, he still lives in the past and has a loss of reality.What? Greatest fighter you are,Then why were you badly beaten up in all those last fights? Masvidal have destroyed you. yes you are a tough dog and you can take it, but just taking it with you doesn't make you a champion this guy has lost touch with reality.. Above all, what are you babbling about about khabib because he only fought top 20-10 people haha. khabib fought against 4 ex champs and a total of five top 5 fighters and all the ones before that were not in the rankings or top 10 like you but tough people at the time but himself was just fresh into the ufc so it's clear that he wasn't straight away can fight against top5 opponents and his long injury of 2 years should not be forgotten either he would have some more fights. you're not even in the rankings yourself, how can you talk about people who are in the top 10 or top 20? you yourself lost 8 times in the ufc got bad beatings from masvidal and many others in the last fights what are you talking about haha ​​about you being the champion. you have a loss of reality smoke a little less weed.
Sounds like Mike lol another one of my favorite fighters
Should’ve been Helwani doing this interview. Brett is a great journalist but he sucks off the UFC, he’s always gonna be biased towards the brand and not the fighters.
God Brett can be so painful
Nate always cuts the interviews when he wants 😆 🤣
His usman impression was perfect lmao
Nate diaz Legend!!!!! ☝☝☝
omg okamoto sux 👎 Only here for Nate
NDA
nick diaz army MF
Letg go chiap y me man bro nate
What?????
I love Díaz, He is the man, will be missed or he will win and go for McDonald lol
I know what nate is going to do. Fake a knock out in the first round and go live his life. The disrespect UFC is showing their veterans is unacceptable. This reminds me of tony fergusson interview.
“This was a great interview, Brett I have to let you go” 😂😂
The Wolf's head is going to fall this weekend. Nate Diaz is coming for the kill 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like nate but all the damage is coming out now CTE is in full form in this interview
He's depressed hhhhiiiggghhh
These guys never fight for points, that's why every fight is great
No lie, made a lot of sense
Must be very annoying to interview him...Too much of everything is a bad thing...
The best fighter in the UFC ever? I understand the need for confidence but you also need to be real with yourself.
Ofcourse his one of the greatest
Nate is gonna shock the world
“This fight is about making this guy” Nate Diaz is switched on to the max
you can tell the disrespect from UFC actually hurt diaz because he knows he doesn’t deserve it
This guys questions suck so much. Stop trying to manufacture the drama, just appreciate Nate for what he has done
Legend shout out to the 209 from the bay area Nor cal in this biiii
Great interview, but what is with the video quality?
A true gangsta.. wearing his glasses on the back of his head to let anyone hostile know that Voldemort sees them
come on NATE!!!! GET IT DONE!!! ROOTING FOR YOU MAN!!!!
Weed will do that to your sense of time. Sitting on the couch for years will seem like just a few days.  Stay off the weeeed!😆.  Just Sayin’
Nate honestly doesn't know who the champions are or they fought and I'm here for all of it.
"Since 17 years old, life has been like a long month."  - Nate Diaz
I hope he has good life insurance
My heart is with Nate but my Brain is with Khamzat 😂
Love Nate, I feel him, but he's delusional. Sad to watch
He wont win but hes brilliant so aware of whats happening never be another like him
Nate has a different mindset, nice interview
209 for life
"Easiest fight I ever had.. and now he's the champion" 🐐
Let’s be honest. This interview is only halfway good because Brett sucks off the UFC(which of course I understand) but you’re a journalist first and foremost.  When it comes to an interview like this you need no filter.  You need Helwani.  Only the Nose could do this correctly.
I hope Nick is in his corner for the fight…
NDA FOREVER 👊👊
Loved the press conferences with Conor
Shut up Nate You will never ever get a belt around your west Be humble man I'm a fan
🐐🐐🐐 Forsure the big organization hate this kind of people cuz they stand for the truth
the eyebrow vs the lip.
Wait! Am I tripping or did Nate loose his last two? I like the Diaz brothers but they need some wins.
Nate always must see TV.
So if Nate wins does that mean khamzat isn't good enough to fight Jake Paul? Jw because Dana said Nate should fight Jake not long ago.
Dude seems more and more mentally disabled. Who says marijuana doesn’t hurt? Nate is simply not a professional athlete, and he is gonna be absolutely dismantled. Reality is gonna hit him like a truck.
though he is gonna lose bul still nate always on the top , he had one the greatest time in ufc history .
LET'S GO NATE!!!   A TON of interesting stuff in this interview wow!!   Love how Nate just ends the interview too lol
- you're welcome, Dubai.  Abu-Dhabi - am I a joke to you?
He's got that Mike Tyson look in his eyes.
Gotta love this guy, a true fighter, in and out, just gotta love him as a real fan.. not those social media chumps who are build up. You become the best cause ppl think your the best , not cause you keep saying your the best.  Bunch of chumps
How can you not love this man
He sounds just like Nick right now
Betting the house on Nate.
DIAZ army all day
I absolutely love Nate Diaz. This is one of the most real people ever to be in the UFC. He says what he means and lives what he means. I would love to see him shut dpwm Chimaev and hand him his first loss.
This is sad man id do anything to be at this fight.
Is Nate a little punch drunk or do we just chuck it up to that’s how he talks
I love Nate! But man ist chaos in his head! That was rough
“This was a great interview Bret I Have to go” -Nate Diaz
"I'm the champion of the whole ufc!" Nate for goat status
"if you're a goat make a goat" classic!!! He is the goat he's fought more top 10 guys than anyone he didn't pad his record . and he's the most quotable guy in the UFC besides his brother Nick
Everyone thinks he's just a stoner, but he's really smart.  He really knows his stats and the sport very well.
" If your Mr. Goat then make a Goat " Nate's greatest line.
Dont know why but I see Robert de Niro face , :D
When Nate chokes out Khamzat they will say he was overrated
Nate is a genius 😂
Drag that idiot into deep waters, he will fold
I hope that Khamzat is gonna win but I really respect this guy and can't imagine people hating on this legend
Nate Diaz the realest to ever do it. Represent 💪🏽💯
His finger must be smelling of weed
Is Nate sad or something?
"Then why are you still doing it ?!? Stupid question of the year award
Win or lose Nate Diaz all the way Realest OG in the game👊🏻💯 Nda Army🙌🏻
Mad respect... diaz 💯
This interview lowered my iq
He looks good compared to his last fights.
Legend
Such a good interview man, love how vocal Nate is about he feels. Forever my favourite fighter,win or lose, I just want him to be happy
Nate is gonnnnne
“Whatever the fuc* his name is” lmaooo
Did Nate say he wants to fight another 15 years? Christ
Nate beat Leon real talk only one guy got hurt....
Dont say win or lose nate is a legend just say he will loose this saturday
Wow.
On Dana 30.00
Wish it was Ariel doing these fight week sit downs
The real greatness is with Brett... he got Nate to talk
Fight gods pleaseeee pleaseeee let nate win this Saturday 🙏
Khamzat fighting with paulo costa Khamzat should focus and worry about nate diaz right now. Don't go into a fight with nate half a** cause will be a bad night
His Usman impression was actually pretty good 🤣🤣
NATE!
what is wrong with the Diaz bothers ? is it drugs or a hereditary mental disease. Respect for him taking the fight anyway.
I’m glad they didn’t use bleeps and just blocked it out. All we would hear is beeps.
Nate continuingly saying he beat leon is one of the best things ever
This dude makes no sense whatsoever
Dude is the white mike tyson
If he can't win, i would hope that he fights defensively. This man has been through so much throughout his career, and that cant be good for his brain, especially how he fights. Come out of this fight safely my brother
It's hard to not seem like you're fishing with Nate diaz. He's a simple man. Fighting in a style that's been around since fighting began.
I don’t really like this fight, it feels wrong. Hopefully he takes minimal damage.
Get em Nate
Nothing special about Nate. Just a guy with too much brain damage.
Nate is a freakin beast
Merced to Stockton 209 nda 4 life
Okamoto cant handle a Diaz interview
CTE is real
Legend of the sport
”I’m the greatest fighter to step foot in the UFC octagon”. I truly love Nate and he is a Legend, but this interview makes him seem somewhat delusional…can’t blame him for being pissed tho.
Nate's high AF lmao
Poor Nate. He's already lost this fight. You can see it in his eyes.
Too much reminiscing in this interview, Nate is a big star in the UFC hope this isn’t it for him..win lose or draw
Nate spent like a year or two asking for fights n for whatever reason it wasn’t made until it was the wolf
crem dela cream?  .. thats the weed talkin
I know we're in the wrong timeline because Nate isn't fighting Tony.
Lol “I’m the champ of the whole ufc” beast
he will get a bad beating from khamzat
We love you nate
Dubai!! 🤣🤣
When he said "everything feels like the other day" I felt that. High school, 2020, even this morning feel like they happened a couple of days ago.
Remember Conor.. Diaz takes the W this weekend!
painful to watch
Nate's the realest fighter in the game
besides the "i'm the best fighter in the world" argument, Nate made a ton of good points... At least fighters are now talking back towards the UFC's terrible practices.
I think Nate has CTE tbh
Nate dog 🤘
This interviewer is kinda lame
707 to the 805 WE GOT YOUR BACK NATE!!!
His aura is that of a legend. All about him. He is like a figure from a book.
UFC history will never compare to boxing history because politics derailed some must have fights in the UFC (Conor vs Nate 3 an example).
Nate and Nick says the craziest sh!t, i tried watching the interview without bias BUT dan he sounds so delusional as always.  He got some good points BUT dam man... Be realistic.
I'm ur biggest fan nate all the best for  ur next fight man ...love from shillong, INDIA..
No one debates your greatness Nate you are definitely going to be in the Hall of Fame. But the fact that you have been more durable than most is going to be a detriment to you in your future. You have nothing left to prove to anyone but yourself obviously. Wouldn't you like to enjoy some of your life with the faculties that you have left?
Nate does talk alot of nonsense such a hard watch
This man makes no sense but somehow I know what he means lol
With Nate throwing out that hypothetical about him getting stomped out and his stock will remain the same makes me think he is going to go in there and get finished quick and flip off the ufc and that’s that have a weird feeling
smarter than he is dumb
This was actually fascinating, he never wanted to be a company guy and always did things on his own terms. Hope you shock the world one more time Nate 💪💪💪
this interview setting is way too personal to be interviewing fighters one week away from fight, its literally like the infamous prince Andrew interview 😂
🐐
If he wins he should just do 2-3 quick boxing matches then sign to Bellator
To be the  greatest is debatable …  But ironicall,  he embodies the soul of the UFC That’s the best way I can put it
I don’t like brets questions
Ariel helwani would’ve known the main event at 1:50
Rooting for Nate 👊🏼
I'm putting my money on nate pulling off a triangle.
Nates and conors last fight should be against each other,  a trilogy
Keep this man protected at all cost 😭
Let's go Nate!
Nate says it all feels the same; like its never ending. This goes along with my impression of Nate not taking losses too badly. Its all just one long battle that hasnlasted for years for Nate.  That may be why he pointed at Leon instead of going after him. He doesn’t liok at this career as a success if he gets a title. Its all just one long fight
Thanks Nate 💙💙💙
will there be press conference before fight?
Nate diaz Is A Champion
Let’s go Nate ….
I can't figure out if Nate is delusional or if he has CTE... And I'm not just talking about his speech impediment, I'm talking about it seems like he forgets what he's talking about like he's punch drunk... It's almost like listening to Evander Holyfield or James Toney nowadays... Whichever organization sanctioned this fight should be sued
CTE is real kids
Seeing this makes me soo sad i hate to see this! Nate been one of my fav fighters! Always gonna be one of the top for me
could understand 30%, of that 30% about 15% made any sense
Legend
Nate Diaz's impersonation of Kamaru Usman nearly  killed me....😂😂🤣
I understand non english speakers better than Diaz, But I watch Diaz interviews and not anyone else.
Boring interviewer dang
why not SUBTITLES?
Is there an uncensored version?
I'm going to disagree with him about his comment about Charles cause Charles is a true martial artist that earned everything he's got and Usman. But I love his comment about never wanting a belt but fighting because he was inspired by MMA legends. Fighting just to fight. Not for any recognition for a belt
The undisputed victims of the world, but we love the Diaz brothers 😆
"Fighters and airport security say the same thing when they see Khamzat: this guy is dangerous."  - Joey Diaz
Nate saying leon was his easiest fight is hilarious 😂 hahah dude really thought he won haha
can someone translate?
Nate is such a G. Dude real as it gets
I respect this guy peoples like this guy but but sorry brother I think Khamza will win this Fight easily ۔۔۔
Legend 😂
Nate would have kick Brett okamota's leg for disrespecting him 🤣🤣
I want Nate to quite, tap out, fake injury… whatever and end this chapter with UFC… and that will still be gangster… ufc fukced them enough already😢
Would’ve like to see tony vs Nate but let’s go diaz
I loveeee Nate and his bro, they’re a part of fight history. The Diaz brothers, the outcasts who dgaf.  Nate is biased I’m not gonna lie, and a lil delusional
The cameraman tracking Nate: ⬅️➡️↖️↗️↕️↪️
REAL INC. #1 maiden voyage
Imagine if he goes out there tap Straight away flips off Dana White 🤣
I feel sorry for Nate, he never will be the same after Khamzat destroys him. Hope he only gets choked out.
Seems tired.
This interview will go down in history
“You welcome dubai” ?? 😂 nate is lost
truth talk Nate
The mind of this person is so clouded. Unfortunately.
Man I hope he don’t die in the ring he can barley talk 😢
(Brett’s asking a totally different question) Nate Diaz: “Crème de la Crème… is that how you say it???” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Feels really rough seeing Nate like this and hearing how he’s been mistreated. All I hope for is that come Saturday we get a great fight.
I got money on Nate regardless 👌
Usman looks like a very humble guy from what I have seen and being humble is not such a bad thing Nate you might try it on sometime, just some friendly advice bro.
Nate mate 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
In convo then comes out with This was a great interview I got to go lol! What a boy!
Brett through most of the interview: mmhmm
"Rory Markum" hahahah
“iM cOnCeRnEd aBoUt NaTeS HeAlTh” bruh he’s sounded like this for 15 years. Please shut the fuhk up.
cant even speak fluent english... hard to listen
Glad to see he stops now that he still is able to speak complete sentences
NDA4LIFE
One of the realist dudes in the UFC, True legend of the sport!
Nate looks like he is heading to the electric chair.
Khamzat will dominate Nate mark these words
In short he feels since he fought everyone he should be treated as a legend and given some respect by UFC, and Shamzat. Which I agree.
209
I'm a big fan of this man but his interviews are a little hard to watch...
Sounds like mile tyson now lol
you couldnt make a better promo for this fight, fighter vs coorperation works
Its 2022 and espn is still uploading videos in 720p which looks a lot like 480p
if all is right in the world, Nate Diaz will win this fight. I feel an upset coming, 209 for life
U got this nate. STOCKTON MOTHERFUCKER!
The way they filmed this interview made it so more dramatic haha
OG
Idc what happens in this fight, obviously I hope Nate wins. But I just hope nate promotes his own fights with Real Fight Inc and we as fans don't illegally stream it and help him make the type of money Jake and Logan have been making. Because Nate's going to bring the fight no matter the opponent, and he deserves a better cut of what's coming in off his fights.
Cte is real lol
fk ya,diaz is the goat
Great Interview with Mr.G Nate Diaz !!! 👍👍👍
Diaz looks lit in this interview 😂
Bro has been hit in the head too much im hearing a sly mike tyson lisp 🤣🤣
He clearly has brain damage
Why does Brett Okamoto always adopt a pose similar to that of a Calvin Klein model
20:01  listen to nate's pronounciation of “ngannou” 💀💀
if you try to chat with a drug addict on the side of the road.  this interview is 99% the same 💀
This interviewer sucks
I've been waiting for this interview. I want to support Diaz so much that I haven't even sat through khamzat's interviews, hoping that it was gonna do massive numbers as soon as Nate's interviews start dropping.
This guy needs to stop 🛑 can't speak or remember anything needs assistance for interviews
NATE DIAZ ARMY MF'S💪
The ending of it had me dying 🤣🤣. Nate really ended the interview for him lol
Khamzat has more to loose in this fight a title shot/ and fan base  Nate win loose or draw his fan base is there and he isn’t looking for a belt at this point in his career
Nate is the Arturo Gatti of MMA. We must all appreciate this man for having entertained us throughout the years.
after watching khamzat v burns...khamzat better hope for a 1st or 2nd round ko because nate only wakes up in 3 4 and 5.
Finish the McGregor trilogy next year Nate,cash out, then hang them up
“This was a great interview Brett, I got to go” 🤣🤣🤣 legend!
"Francis Nigganou" haha. Nates legend
Nate Diaz IS a needlemover
These interviewers really need to stop with the counselor style questioning. Just ask the dude about fighting that's what he does that's what he knows
💯 He came with all the 💨💨
Is this a 3 or 5 round fight?
His great fighter legendary.
14 Losses and Diaz thinks he is the GOAT??? TOO MUCH WEED!!!!!
“You should’ve worked on a computer you nerd” -Nathaniel Diaz
Wow this is sad!!! Nate Diaz will always be the people's champ....Thank you so much bro
Nate will catch him in the 4th surprise surprise MFs then leave the UFC
Let’s rally behind him, I don’t like Khamzat.
Nate for the win let’s go champ
Looks like Nick in the thumb nail.
If this is the last of Nate in the UFC, he will be definitely missed. One of a kind!
You ain't gonna kill diaz spirit unless you literally kill him
Why so blurry poor quality
I think this is why I like and respect Nate so much. He is real .. “I’m nobody’s b*tch”
I love Nate but Khamzat will destroy him !
My money's on nate
"You do steroids i smoke weed let's get in there and squab " 😂😂😂
DIAZ VS FERGUSON WAS THE BIGGEST FIGHT TO MAKE YOU BLEW IT DANA
If my exam answer sheets was ever turned into a video it would definitely be this one
Super mega ultra unfair UFC towards ma my boy Nathan. Facts. They gave him a young tall muscled goat assassin filled up with strength motivation power and rage when his career is about to end...seriously Dana? The UFC does not deserve a guy like my boy Nathan. Also facts.
Brett is trying so hard to get some type of visceral reaction and he just can't get Nate started. It's lik trying to start a fire with a bow. Ariel seems so much better. Maybe it's his personality
FACTS
Every Diaz Interview: *”F**k him F**k them and F**k everybody”*
This man is a human punching bag, his level of delusion is actually admirable. Dos Anjos, Rory McDonald and Benson Henderson all destroyed him, that's why he never fought for a title.
Man I hope the crowd turns up for Nate come fight night and shows this man the love he deserves. The realist to ever do it. Lets go Nate!!!
Nate Diaz will always be my favorite fighter till the end of time
This fight is brought to you by real righting corporate lmao! Diaz a real 💯
The realiest of them all. Takes on all comers and put his fist up. Go get this one done Nate.
Best in the world
I wish nate gets the W ....let go nate ur the real warrior..
I love nate you can hear the emotions in his voice and they ain't good vibes he don't get enough respect he's no one's fall guy facta
Lmfao "you do steroids,  I'll smoke weed and we can squab"
Real OG
9:49 Nate's Kamaru impression is un-ironically the funniest thing I've heard in months.
I hope Nick is in his corner, gotta love and respect the absolute admiration and love he has for his big brother….let’s go Nate! I’ll be watching and cheering for you.. Hope you get the win! Nick Diaz Army 💪🏼 👊🏼❗️
Burns beats diaz 9/10
After watching this interview I’m confident in wagering my entire years mortgage on Chimaev by finish.
Nate and khabib will forever be my favorite UFC fighters
he look like tom hanks
Wonder why the decision went to the other guys
I feel like there is a high probability that Borz is going to slap Nate in this fight.
Nate knows he has little to no chance.
The interviewer just lost this conversation.
It’s a crime he’s not fighting Ferguson. Would have always been a dream fight
20:01 no way he just called Ngannou "N*gganou" LMFAOOO🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who's the Top 5 Nate asks ... Nate answer's.... I will fight them all in 5 seconds
Most loyal dude in the UFC right here
The king.
It’s a sport which fighters beat each other up to the pulp but we can’t let the fans hear a few bad words! Stop w the censorship it’s lame
So he didn't ask for this fight huh, that's news
I love Nathan!!! When he’s done talking…he’ll let you know. 😂👏🏾👏🏾
The fans win this matchup.. doesn’t matter who has their hand raised at the end.. we win this one.
Who does it feel like ur going to war against this weekend?   Nate: “the organization”   Man 😥
Fighting and smoking damage your brain
ESPN mma blows but I’ll watch for Nate
Nate Diaz army kill or be killed
A few months ago Diaz was asking for Porier , Tony Ferguson , even asked for Luque and Michael Chandler .. then UFC is like “he asked for Francis Ngannou !” and fed him to Khamzat . They’re some shady bastards
Nate a Dogg and is dropping facts
CTE plus too much weed
Bret is so boring
so sad, it's like his about to start to cry, last fight in UFC. :(
Nate ”Fidor Malenko” Diaz
He should go on the MMA hour we all know this questions are scripted and approve by Dana
0% chance of winning. 100% chance of retiring.
All the crotch sniffing lovers need to hear this
When Nate expresses himself it comes off a bit wild but with time it makes sense.
Nate is more outgoing than Nick … Reason why he got so famous quicker
This motherfkn ESPN journalist is so good in his job. With all due respect .. Nate is a living legend and without which this sport would be much boring, one of the most amazing boxers and personality .. But let's not make him a gangster, because he is not. Show business gave him this label, but show business is stupid. Khamzat will send this dude to retire, he is 37 years old but we can see that he is simply too old ... just the same like his pseudo -gangster brother.
mma media needs to stop saying nate wants this fight. his coach and now him have now both said they didnt want this fight lol.
Finally a sit down with the fukn man.    Just questions.   No distractions
His awkward silence is the best
He doesn’t seem well. I mean he speaks slow but he seem really bad here ☹️☹️
Love him or hate him, he is a living legend of the game.
Love how Nate just ends the interview when he thinks it's been good enough! 😆 Gangster
Can we get the explicit version of this interview?oh myyyyyy
the ufc just want to give this boy the most brain damage possible before he leaves , cold world.
I understood 3 words
Peoples Champ!!
😭😭😭 Nate really thinks he beat leon
😎
We are with you Nate ,you will win 🏆
when he said "i got homeboys at home that are harder than any champion" i instantly thought of that clip where diaz is talking to khamzat and diaz says "my boys right here fight him" and the camera just pans to a scared little kid
Why did they record this interview using the first generation iPhone...
Nate's gonna win.
In other words, tried to be the class clown
Stuff he's taking is good 💉💊
I’m only about five minutes into this interview and already I can see the unsaid truths and it’s heartbreaking. Literally didn’t want to believe he was being done wrong by the UFC but he is.. Clearly.. 😓 I hope his next chapter in life is one of mutual respect. His attitude brings it upon himself but I still hate to see it happen. ✌️
His new promotional company is going be fire 😜
Nganu fight would be fun I pick Nate winning by slapp
I should check out this Fedor Milanko guy
It is morally questionable to keep subjecting this guy to more and more brain damage
I need subtitles pls
LEGEND! 209!!!! NICK DIAZ ARMY!
“I sold you this fight dummy!” Love it and he’s right. Kudos for taking this fight no one else will. Hes basically the single or second biggest draw on the roster and he’s willing to fight the single or second toughest test to get out of his contract
More money Nate 💰
I think he just want to get done with this one last fight and fair well to the ufc
"you do steroids, ill smoke weed, and lets get in there and squab" LMAO 24:05
I lost brain cells watching this sequence 5:12
Nate Diaz is deeply depressed and delusional. He needs help, seriously.
I'm just trying to imagine, how it will feel inside the arena, if Nate KOs Khamzat in the 5th 🥰
He must be baked out of his mind.
Nate has a voice of a 75 year old grandpa, but looks like the meanest gangsta ever
Nate Diaz kinda resembles Robert De Niro.
should've been Nate vs Dustin.. could've put Khamzat on the Abu Dhabi card against Sean Brady or something.. i respect Nate will fight whoever but this fight makes no sense
Oh he's gonna die
Nah Brett gtoh we need Ariel.
Best interviewer ever! No hidden agendas like that weasel
Love u Nate ...... ♥️
When I Think about the UFC the first fighters I think about is the Diaz Brothers💯🔥💯REAL OG
I hope Nate and his team have something up their sleeve. If Nate wins the roof will come off the UFC not just the stadium.
Nathan by 5th round KO
He has nothing to prove ... period established awhile ago
This was a mistake Dana will regret to make this fight.  I have a bad feeling Nate is gonna get very badly hurt in there.
crazy stuff here, legends last ufc fight. respect
FKN 🐐🔥
I love this dude. Mad respect
Does he look a little chubbier than usual??
Team Diaz all the way baby get this👊
It's nates time to shine. His bro passed it to him. Keep it 100 nate
“Pressure on you motherf***** I don’t give a fuhkk”
The one and only. Respect to this Legend.
Nate is hilarious. I hope he wins.
He’s going to get smashed to bits
i kinda feel like nick an nate have autism cause there behavior really shows it.  there so ...... all oover the place
I just pray the cuts don’t get to bad. This is gonna be a dog fight I can’t wait. Let’s go Nate
Wow this interviewer sucks
He's high af 🤣💨💨
even himself dont understand what hes talking, legend
He does not feel very confident going into this one
That Brock Lesnar event Nate was talking about was UFC 141?
Hope he wins man
Nate diaz definitely the G.O.A.T
Put some respect on his name! Seriously. A legend in the sport. His name will ring bells forever!
NICK DIAZ ARMY MF!  REPPIN THE 209 ALL THE WAY FROM 337 LOUISIANA!  Nate is my hero!
His Usman impression was actually good🤣
Nate is a champion even when he doesn't win.
You should leave then come back for the Connor trilogy and if the UFC was smart they’d also put Brock on that same card
Love Nate, but Interviewers have to really act different and not themselves or normal reaction to get through it….just because Nate is so d@mn different  That’s not a slight, just an observation and I’ll watch a Diaz fight any day and twice on Sunday!
23:35 LMAO
720p gang
Diaz via RNC
Nate should walk into the cage tap on the ground soon as the fight starts and walk out.
Imagine if Nate just taps or his team stops the fight before the fight even starts
This reminds me of Nicks interview last year with Brett. Just raw uncut emotion pouring out. Speaking straight truth.
In the thumbnail Nate  looks just like your average overweighted neighbour
There is not even 1% chance Nate wins
It’s such a shame to see Nate so unhappy being in ufc I think people need to boycott the ufc after Nate goes
Thank you Nate! Welcome Daniel Rodriguez! He’s the closest thing to Diaz.
Most of them would have turned down khamzat.. but huge respect to Nate for his heart n courage towards the sport he ain't no westcoast gangster  ❤️
"This was a good interview Bret, I have to go"
🔥🔥
I have big respect for Nate. He sticks to who he is and his principles.  Massive respect.  I want you to win.  I will shout 'I'm not surprised mother fuckers!'.
Such a savage
Legend
narrative is the world you were looking for nate.
Man it's hard to watch Nate do an interview 😂
I love Nate but man this guy smokes a lot of weed and gets hit a lot. That’s why this guy can’t speak English good. I’m still rooting for Diaz
720p ESPN need to step up their game 😫
Looks like nate has already lost the fight in his mind !!
02:52 Trying not to say “low moments”. 😆
Nate is so much more aware than I thought
NATE DIAZ IS A FREAKING LEGEND!!!  Nate Diaz is going to shock the world mark my words.  Impossible to knockout, world class elite jiu jitsu, and the best cardio we have ever seen.  Did I mention that he's just now hitting his PRIME?  We will be making history and showing the world who the true alpha lions are.  NATE DIAZ ARMY STAND UP WHERE YOU AT!?  Make some NOISE!!!
the fact espn doesn't upload in 1080p says it all about them
LEGEND👑
Smoke weed
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Most heart most bravery nate is the best
Bruv, you do you! That's what most of us are here for. God bless.
this is sad, they should do Tony vs Nate and instead they sacrifice both of them...its not right! Sad!
Nate is gonna win
Lmao I didn't wrestle or try to win I was the champion of my town I know homies that are way harder..... the cte is real
“UPSET INCOMING!” 💪
Watched him on The Ultimate Fighter and now to see him maybe in his last fight in the UFC is going to be epic.
Team Diaz for life 💪
idk why but Nate gives major Tuco Salamanca vibes in this interview
He’s so stoned. Love it
if your mr goat why cant you make a goat you know what im saying. what a great nate diaz quote!!!
Nate winning this fight and retiring would be fine. Save what is left of his brain. Never doubt the Diaz brothers, but time has not been kind.
would be big fk u 🖕🏻to Dana/ufc  if Nate were to somehow pull this off.  NDA
Khamzat said recently its hard to understand Nate because of all the smoking, I think he's got a point, something is off with this man.
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE IS STILL  FIGHTING ??
Listening to Nate Diaz try and formulate his thoughts into words is just painful. It literally makes my brain hurt.
Been hit way to many times.
while I’m exited it’s a LOSE LOSE situation because i don’t want Nate Diaz to get knocked out and destroyed but if khamzat doesn’t destroy him hype train on the line 💨 💨
Can anyone translate what Nate said?
🌄❤🌄 ❤🌄❤
I love him but hes beyond delusional lol
Okamoto is so awkward... Makes me really uncomfortable.
Hope he stays doing something proactive after his last fight or else the depression will creep in.
Nate a true legend of the game!!!
Halfway through, Did he even say Khamzat Chimaev ones? I don't think he did
NICK AND NATE ARE OLD SCHOOL CAME UP RIGHT UNDER THE GRACIES LIKE THEIR FAMILY.  I THINK THE DIAZ NAME IS BIGGER THAN GRACIE ALREADY BUT US FIGHTERS KNOW WHAT IT IS AND WE RESPECT GRACIE AND WILL ALWAYS LET IT KNOWN THEY PAVED THE ROAD YA HEARD IT HERE FROM NATE.
Battle of the Stocks Stockton vs Stockholm
Nate makes less and less sense as he gets older. He's talking nonsense
Ufc dropping videos in 720p I thought my TV was broke lol
Khamzat gonna kill Nate easy
My heart rips apart ...this guy is going to be murdered
Honestly it sounds like Nate knows he’s gonna lose lol best of luck to him though
Where is Ariel Helwani?
Nate: "I gotta make somebody for the UFC? " WHOW!!! Exactly
Nate Diaz,  1/1
"You Fought Burns dawg... You fought BURNS"😂😂😂😂 the disrespect
This young man seems to make a point of not giving a f..k.
Nate likes b slapping people
All I have to say is Thank You Nate... Same to Nick.... Thank You.
why so low quality vid espn??
The man who hasn't won a belt but still gets paid 1 mil every time he steps in that's a real champ. "Get your money up not you funny up rawwr !"
I think it was either Overeem or Carwin. But anyway I hope you win Nate I really think you're going to. Afterwards I really hope you think about retiring though before it's too late and you end up like Muhammad Ali. You don't have anything to prove to anyone, you are one of the greatest fighters of all time don't let anyone tell you differently.
Classic awkward Nate Diaz interview.
Hearing Brett say “mhmm, mhmm”  for 33 minutes will make your ears bleed
We all praying for the upset big dawg…. THEY MUST HAVE FORGOT
We Love You Nate. The end of an Era
You think he’s gonna give a tear jerker speech?
Nate is so cooked
If this is his last fight which I hope it's not you no he will go out swinging......chamzat has not been tested like this...I mean look how Diaz shut Connor up...great fight I'm excited
nate is so punch drunk, bro can barely put together a sentence
I love ma boy Nathan...I feel kinda worried and I don't want him to fight this unfair fight. I hope God protects ma boy Nathan with a divine shield for the whole fight. I hope nothing bad happens. 🙏
Nate via 🔺with 🖕🖕
Guy is punch drunk. Sounds risky putting him in there on Saturday. Guy should fake an injury after 10 seconds
I've said it before and I'll say it again THE REALEST OF THEM ALL 👊
My 🐐🐐
Hyped af
The volume is so low, poor audio quality espfuckingn
Please, i need subtitles for this.
Pov: you are watching Nate talk to his psychiatrist
He doesn't look that well.
It looks like counseling session.
Nate is goat 🐐
Gourmet chechen Is in a lose lose situation
He looks like he’s tired of fighting. He just wants peace.   He’ll loose. Unfortunately, that’s not debatable. There’s an absolute beast on the other side. I just hope it’ll be poetic loss.
Rather if they deserve or not. If my guys aren’t in then I’m not!! Real G
I just want Diaz to slap Khamzat a couple of times that’s all.
I love Nate.
“Y’all saw how I did that?” I love that attitude. Dude has NEVER given less than his heart. He’s never lost with that approach. For all you haters, 20 years later we’re all still shouting our opinions about the dude…seems he has skills. Regardless, he will fight anyone & this should garner respect from anyone that loves this game. “I’m not surprised Mother F**kers”
At 13:15 he was teary eyed 😃
Nate: "Oh, that was my last fight here in Las Vegas?" ... "I thought it was last night at the club".
Every time feels the same to Nate because of his massive CTE
Brett sucks
MFs still uploading 720p videos in 2022????
Guys everyone read this comment i am from the future:  Nate submittes Khamzat chimiev then fight leon edwards for the title, he knocks out leon edwards then fights conor mcgregor for the welterweight belt, conor knocks out diaz and becomes first ufc 3 weight champ
Bret asks the worst questions I’ve ever heard from a professional Jesus
Lol one question turns into a story about completely something else lol 😂 i love this guy
12:38 After mumbling and having linguistical constipation for a very long time....Nate finally says what he was trying to say, "I'm the champion of the  whole UFC!"
30:50 small glimpse of Nate speaking Spanish
Lose or lose, Diaz is still a legend.
don’t leave us Nate 🥲
If he lasted 5 rounds against Conor in the 2nd fight  after submitting him in the first one and went the distance with Leon Edwards(who knocked out Usman outcold) he can go the distance with Chimaev so long as he doesn’t get pummeled too badly like in his fight against Masvidal. He’s a pro in Jiu-jutsu so that should help him against khamzat’s wrestling, it did so for Burns so to speak. Chimaev will win via unanimous decision again assuming there’s no doctor stoppage.
You do steroids I smoke weed let’s get in there and squash! Lol  Nate never loses he just runs out of time ⌛️
Brett is sitting there like he’s finally accepted the fact that his interviews are a 50 quid an hour therapy session
I didn't understand anything but I still watched the whole interview
Nate is similar to a WWE jobber
He knows his fate is a bad ko loss
Nate has a lot of resentment here.  He's done . Already checked out.  This final battle will be his send off . The final closer of this long epic chapter.  He gave UFC so much and they did him quite dirty in this final year. Total support Diaz Army ✊ ⚡
I really would love Nate to win.
bruh Nate has always been my favorite Diaz bro
A pissed of Diaz is a dangerous Diaz.
“Nate Diaz you just shocked the world” after he beats Hazmat
legend, i grew up watching diaz brothers.. and all the other legends. for him speak and all the emotions, that is passion.
STOCKTON VS STOCKHOLM!!!.
The closed captions are just useless. I recommend just 1.5x speed
Nate is too real for the game
Nate is so F-ing cool. How could you not like this guy!!!
Real fighting Inc.  Let’s go Nate!  “I’m Not surprised mf!”
Creme Della creme homie..top che ya know lol
LOL at Dana trying to reason with this guy.
Nate diaz is stuck in the past.
nice video quality ESPN jesus
You are the champ nate. In my eyes.
Come on Nate make it happen
Nate Diaz win or lose we love you! Go get'em 😚
Nate is a sore loser...............
This dude interviewing Nate makes it seem soo weird
WHEREVER NATE GOES WE WILL GO AND SHOW OUR SUPPORT AS LONG AS WE KNOW WE WILL WATCH    YOUTUBE GOTS NATES BACK I TALKED TO MY COUSIN THAT WORKS THERE.
I love Nate, he is a legend. But anyone who thinks he can beat Khamzat is delusional
“I understood, but I also didn’t understand. But now I really understand”  -Nate Diaz
Was this shot in 90s?
Nate’s brain is fogged up with weed smoke And CTE and he still gonna win
We’ll miss u Nate. 🖤💯
You know who the Real fight is!🔥❤️
This 2 brothers have a really mental issue, seriously
13:30 I really agree with him even if he’s lost, he just loves scrapping it’s his thing, honestly I believe he could’ve been champion such a long time ago but he doesn’t put himself in the mindset of a champ. Just my opinion I could totally be wrong lol
not everybody if Washington would let me bet I ain't got allot but all my money's on nate
I like Nate but he is seriously delusional
Yikes! Feels like Nate isnt 100% there. 😕😦  He shouldn't fight
I’m backing diaz I know he’s a massive underdog but I’m not going to switch up I want him to win
Does nate forget his failed drug test? SARMs don't count as gear?
Nate has always been my favourite fighter. Always will be.
No subtitles come on ESPN it's very difficult to understand nate😔
Nate is In a bad place this won’t be good
MOST OVERRATED EVER, only big Win was a OVERHYPED MCGREGOR
Nate is truly the people's champ
I'm rooting for Nate- think it's an incredibly shytty way to send off a TRUE LEGEND of UFC.
I wish Nate wins and end on a high note
Nates gonna lose, but man put on a show baby luv ya
You know what I'm sayin'
I feel like they should’ve got someone else to interview. Brett isn’t very personable…
Interesting story. I knew where he was headed
I love Nate to death but his interviews are hard to listen too. I’m sure without the cameras he opens up a bit more but idk.
Guys Nate’s an Old Man now respect for him going out on his shield 🛡
Nate is the guy ufc are chumps Fr fr. This guy was khamzat before khamzat. Remember that. And burns put khamzat down twice so it’s not like it’s impossible. I’ve seen stranger things.   I hope Nate just goes and gets paid ufc did him and his bro wrong since forever.
Nate Diaz bloodied and beaten gets the 3rd round submission!!
Nate Will Conquer
I dont care if nate lose this fight. I want to see how many round he can survive
He's becoming immortal
What a real fighter!!!
that's why we need ariel helwani to host
9:50 IM DED 💀 Nate’s accurate impression of Kamaru caught me off guard
so punch drunk, needs to walk away soon while he still can!!!
He’s delusional
Stockton v Stockholm
If Diaz is the underdog I'm in Lets go Diaz
Man let Ariel interview Nate okimkto can’t handle him lol
Brett Okamotos interviews are so boring, if I'm being honest.
This reminds me a lot of nicks last interview with Yamamoto
I’d rather see Nate lose quick and painless than a 5 round beat down
.......................RESPECT....................
why 720p quality though ?
Nate is gonna make someone a lot of money lol
I dislike Brett
20:10 the truuuth
Great Interview P.S i'm 30secs in.
this card is absolute trashbag lol, chimaev will run through everyone's favourite weedguy and all other fights are fcking pointless
12:06 the “Stockton illusion” 🤪 🤣 great vid, Nate 🙌🏽 🙌🏽 respect!
No Closed Caption for this? Come on Man!
I wonder if he has CTE
Sounds like he’s already counting himself out. So unlike him. He does not want this.
LOL WHAT THE F IS THIS GUY ON ABOUT?  making excuses why he was never a champ , dude is mad delusional.
His impression of Usman is spot on 😆
He's high AF
Gotta love Nate
This is the kind of fight that we know in advance obviously who is gonna win 🏅
ESPN thanks for the interview but the quality of these vids need to go up. 720p is not enough tbh
its hard to listen
You have to waste 3 lines of yay and down half a bottle to make sense of the Diaz interviews. This is a rare person we're talking about here.
THE COLDEST THING "YOU'RE THEIR CHAMPION." ILLEST THING SAID.
3:00 - “With the high moments, you can expect the low moments and with the low moments, you can expect the high moments.”  Don’t mistake this man for a fool.
I think nate will leave the biggest legacy and the biggest wins in the ufc  By far the goat of fighting and becoming a super star everytime hes came up against adversity he proves us wrong  You have to respect him 209s realist 💯
Rooting for Nate to pull off the upset.
Odds say Diaz should be smashed quick, we will see about that. DIAZARMY
I almost forgot Brett is interviewing 😂😂😂Nate, who is releasing his anger to Psychologist Brett🤣🤣
Odds say Diaz should be smashed quick, we will see about that. DIAZARMY
This guy already half brain dead good thing he is done after this
seriously he didnt use to talk like this. why isnt anyone commenting on this.. hes taking too much punsihment
9:27 Rickson Gracie is one of the best and here's a quote from Rickson "Everything Bruce Lee spoke, was the true essence of martial arts and his philosophy about fighting was 100% correct."
Tony n Nate please....that would be the most epic fight..evn more epic than jones vs ngannou would be
Greetings nerds n virgins
LET'S GO NATE!!!🔥🔥🤘
I hope he wins. He stalled McGregor's train. Hopefully Khamzat too.
Can't wait for the press conference and the trash talk 😂
rest in peace nate
Let's set up a GoFundMe for ESPN, they clearly can't afford a decent camera
No way this guy is interviewing Nate after disrespecting him in the Chimaev interview. Get this guy off ESPN
Nate seems nervous like a soldier going into war
Felt like I was watching this on my VCR
This guy is going to retire after this fight.
God dammit Nate take a breath and get your sentences out Jesus Christ like an anxious kid this fool is gonna tko himself trying to speak
Totally off the topic. Did anybody realize the door in the back open in the beginning of the video 🧐
There will never be anyone like him or his brother again in the sport needle movers🥊
Not a single person is thinking nate is gonna win. So ima bet and lose 50 bucks on the match just In case lighting strikes the octagon 😆
Holy CTE Batman
Diaz is getting his release. Whatever happens on Saturday he's already won. 💯💯
Khamzat better not get comfortable with this guy, Nate is unpredictable!
Let's go big dog Nate 🖕🖕🌎🌎💯💯
UFC should get his TUF coach a cageside seat. The one and only Jens Pulver
This is quite upsetting. You can see he's hurt by this
Nate this whole build up has been very different honestly I don't really like this
Conor made him
People acting like Nate is retiring. He clearly isn't. He's taking this fight to get out of his UFC contract and ACTUALLY get paid.
Nate will be missed greatly when he's gone , and will be appreciated more  . End of an era.
I hate this weird interviewer
Okamato is pretty condescending. Definitely no Japanese left in him.
Seems like a therapy session
He sounds very very punch drunk
Man i love this guy but i don't like this energy 😬
Why does all of these Brett's interviews are in such a bad quality?
Whatever happens , its hard not to like this dude and root against. Dude is absolutely  100%  Authentic , himself . I hope nothing but success as a promoter . I can see him looking out for the fighter rather than himself and if a guy like this is on your team , he is going to look out . Its what he is all about .
Man this is the real gangster right there.. doesn't matter where he goes I'm following him
DIAZ ARMY 🖕😎🖕
The only person that could ever pull off an upset like this is Nate Diaz.
This will be the first time Nate will be ko
Good interview. Bret let him talk without much interrupting.
Legend No question
whoever runs the production or cameras for these sit down interviews - why is the quality always horrible and 720p ?
Ariel had him weeks ago - y’all suck.
After listening to this interview, I feel like I need to read a book or two…To recover my brain cells.
Whats up with the quality of these interviews man
Nate knows khamzat will beat him . Sucks
They are talking to the man like it’s a funeral. I understand he is going to lose but dam.
“It’s a fight, As far as I’m concerned, Him being the favorite, And ppl thinking he gonna take me out in 1 Round,  Better take me clean out by the way the odds are, Pressure is on dawg”  209 Nate Diaz 💯💯💯
Brett's just letting Nate talk .....hahaha good job totally 👏
Punch drunk bad
Crappy, feeding him to this killer. They want Nate to leave with less clout. Crappy
This is like when Apollo went out fighting Drago.
Nate is always 💯 He will always have the respect of the fans.
Nate n mike tyson do a podcast. I wanna listen to it
Jake Paul KOs Diaz inside 2 rounds
We might witness the first death in the cage this weekend folks do not bring children to the event
Is Brett the GOAT of boring interviewer ?
It's gonna be hard fight to watch
Hate to say it but nates getting smoked
Nate is really exposing a lot Politics in the fight game
Holy 209!
Nate runs out 1st round and fakes a knee injury, collect his checks, and is free to do what he wants
This remind me of the Nick and Ariel interview.
When you look up the definition of 'OG', there is a picture of Nate Diaz
8:39 stop bleeping out the interview YouTube isn’t made just for little kids
This guy Bret sucks. ESPN I need that job!
This man smoke too much weed that’s the real issue here 😂
Giving respect to Josh Thompson
“ .. for the rest of your life, go out, touch gloves, and fight. “
What was this video shot with, Nokia 6600 VGA camera?
My heart goes out to all affected by this
Lmfaoo @ Nate 12:40
Dana white did nate dirty  why not tony Ferguson or somebody that's been in the UFC for 15 years like me
Looks more and more like nick
Shane Gillis and Nate gonna be a lethal tag team in WWE after this weekend.
idgaf im betting on Nate .
Diaz vs Joaquin Phoenix ladies and gentlemen
Absolute legend, never be another one like Nate
1 of the realists in the ufc....💯 and to  all writing him off its sad,  nates gas tank kicks in 4th   5th round why his opponants is depleting   by the 3rd💯👀 so khamzat best get him out there quick if what all the sh!@ talkers rekon will happen......oh boy the roof will come off walls will crack from the roar of the crowd  if nate can pull this off....LETS GOO NATE .🙌👊
Any more CTE and nate won't be able to tie his own shoe laces. Guy can barely string a sentence together
This will be closer than ppl think.
Nate has an entire army behind him. Win, lose or draw, the respect remains the same
720 p for nate diaz......... 4k for connor,,is that a joke espn?
Dana is a clown for not giving him the Dustin fight
Brett sucks at interviewing.  Get a professional dammit
Nate's answers have nothing to do with the questions... and yet there's still some wisdom in there 🤷‍♀
I think this will be a legendary interview that we will look back on 10 years from now.
How to switch okamoto from this video with literally anyone else? one of the most boring humans of all time
I'm the most impeccable champion there's ever been
Hope nate wins what a top guy
Typical Diaz interview; talked a lot. Said nothing.
Ok seriously, English isn't my first language... But I do consider myself to be fluent, I can understand khamzat better than Nate. When ever he speaks I really need to focus on what he says
So Much sexual tension
Win or lose Nathan Diaz deserves his spot in the UFC hall of fame.
Seems like someone needs to throw an arm around Nate .. seems emotional but keeping it together barely
A Nate Diaz interview, unfortunately it’s with Brett.
Seems like a guy that feels unappreciated
What?
Nate loves Brock Lesnar
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I love this dude with all my heart. I want to shake his hand
If anything Nate by TKO or submission if the fight don’t go khamzat’s way
Old school 🎒
Nate seems to be getting worse. Says one thing then one sentence later says the opposite. Usman didn't fight anybody? Weed that good doesn't exist. It's like his memory lapses every 30 seconds. He needs to retire before that 30 turns to 5 and he gets stuck mid sentence.
NATE DIAZ THE  MAN
can't watch Brett
Why has Nate got his glasses on the back of his head 😂
Nate is one the biggest stars in the UFC simply because he’s just being himself
This is a low key sad of the UFC to end Nate’s career like this. They gave guys like cowboy easier  fights with fighters who respected his legacy. Putting a fighter like Nate against a rising star like khamzat is absolutely wrong. Instead of a happy farewell everyone is sweating Nate’s health… especially after this interview.
A lot of bitterness coming out here.  I dont see him caring enough to put on a good show, unfortunately.
It was hard to understand
💯💯💯
12:42 😂👏🏻💯
CTE is real, my man struggles with his memory, dellusions & with his speach.. 😬 He has taken way to much damage, im glad this last fight will be his last taking damage
I can never make it through a single Nate Diaz interview, it's always like sitting down with an unprepared 5th grader
NATE WINS WITH A GUILOTINE IN THE FOURTH ROUND IDGAF
I can see nate getting just beat up for 5 rounds but at the same time coming back with his own strikes as well.. who knows hes a durable guy and khamzat did show signs of slowing down in the burns fight
That's why most love the Diaz Brothers, because they aren't company men. That's why he keeps dissing Usman, who you could easily argue is a company head.
Right off the jump, never seen anyone rock sunglasses backwards.
Man i hope Nate destroys khamzat. Would be the biggest FU to the ufc
12:39 ☠️🖤!!!!   WARRIOR!!!!!!
Lets Go Diaz YOU CAN PULL THIS.
Come on Nate, surprise these motherfuckers again please  😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Bret is so unlikeable.
Imagine Nate getting khamzat In a leg triangle and flipping off the cameras while Khamzat submits. Only in my dreams I guess lol
Nick is the reason i started watching MMA and got to Nate...Diaz brothers, win or lose...Nick Diaz Army for life..Diaz bothers don't loose, they just get out of the time,, their opponents survive but in the street or jungle, like Diaz said that's a wrap...
Nate just tired my brother  fought everybody from day one on the other hand khabib and macgregor cant even top dat it's just crazy they not even fighting anymore loyalty to the game 🙏🏾❤🧨
Charles Oliveira would smoke Nate Diaz
Let’s do this Nate we are with you shock the world.
I think we would all love it to go past 3 rounds to see if the fight gets competitive if khamzat starts to fade and Nate's cardio takes over, In reality I think it will be stopped before then due to Nate's scar tissue opening up or him just getting pinned and smashed, I think khamzat can win this fight wherever it goes, he has a crazy strength and power advantage, he can ragdoll Nate if he wants to a lot worse than Rory MacDonald did, or beat him up badly on the feet. Khamzat has a granite chin, nothing Nate Diaz will throw at him is going to bother him unless he's completely gassed in the later rounds. Nates last TKO/KO was back in 2013. I'd love Diaz to win, but he's literally being fed to the wolves/wolf
My heart says nate but my wallet says chimaev🙌🙌
Nate is so delusional when he talks about how good he is and good others are 🤦😂 guy is not even close to being one of the best.
After the Conor fight, I don’t know why people still think level of competition doesn’t matter. This guy has been fighting UFC fighters his whole career. Khamzat has like 6 fights in UFC.
UFC bout to lose a real one... Hope he goes out like a Boss, LFG!!!
Horrible audio Where's ariel
Hè is looking fat
This man is delusional been hit in the head WAY to much lol
Represent the regular guys brother,  you are one of the world's Representations of the Modern-day Gladiator. Nick and Nathan Diaz Army. Wish my wife and I could be there. GOOD LUCK BROTHER
I can translate
Nate thanks for the incredible moments,  anyone who fights you gets a push and they should thank you. will be a good fight I am sure all the lick a$$ mfs will say other wise but mf them.
Most overrated fighter of all time
Is there a more boring reporter than this guy...
"It don't feel right if it aint happenin" so real, fighters after their career is over deal with the absence of having a fight coming up. It can be devastating if fighters don't have something to do immediately after
Think it’s time Nate addressed his demons..
Love Nate. Win or Lose. Warrior.
Nate slowly sound like Mike tyson from all those punches he got...
Dude is half dead
love nate but i lost brain cells listening to this interview. Just delusional.
I don't understand anything. Translator ,Please
No one does it like Ariel Helwani!
Nate came off as very down in this interview, seems conflicted or emotional about it all.
I'm on you're side Nate!
This interview made me like and slightly understand Nate diaz
Can we get an uncensored version of this?
Nate Diaz has my respect, hope he wins
I'm a Nate fan but it feels like Nate knows he's going to lose and get demolished for this fight...
Diaz gang
Nate walking to the gallows flipping everyone off
Nate by DQ
Nate took the head off of the #1 P4P Double Champ. This wolf pup is the one being brought to slaughter.
🔥👊Diaz Army👊🔥
He did a good Usman impersonation.  Lmao. Nate is unintentionally funny.
Brett’s interview with Khamzat was inches apart from each other , With Nate it’s feet , He’s knows who the real threat is 🤣🤣💯💯
NDA❤️
Not a good vibe from Nate
Let's also talk about why's the quality low. ESPN???
I have a feeling that this is going to be an upset and Nate is going to choke Khamzat Chimaev
I lasted 13 minutes. Waste of time. Delusional
9:50 Nate Diaz Kamaru Usman impression got me dead 🤣☠️
NDA
So badly want him to get the W
That man got a lot ghosts  Hopefully he is OK after all of these wars and somehow finds peace
@ 9:49 Nate Diaz the impersonator was born 😆
You can see the gears struggling to turn in nates  head and even then, what he's saying is nonsense
I pray for his health in this one.
"Everything feels the other day." ~ Nate Diaz
1:38  All of those who interview Nate need to embrace for silence, tension and the unknown mumbles.  Well done Brett.
Nate looked and sounded like he was holding back tears
Okamoto sitting pose is Beta
You can tell he's dialed in mentally. He knows what's waiting for him
He’s interesting
Dang I hope Nate retires soon. He sounds more punch drunk now than ever before.
How does he get cleared by commissions. He sounds less coherent than when Max got pulled.
Lol Nate dissin Usman
you know the weed is good when you can barely string sentences together
Nate don't like talking to Brett haha
This is supposed to be Nate Diaz get his azz kicked on the way out the door with the UFC, Dana’s way of saying “ SIGNORA”
Diaz getting rolled up & smoked
Dead man talking.
I’m a khamzat Fan but he’s been too much again lately,Nate is has Humble as they come 🔥 May the True WARRIOR WIN 🏆
Shame on the ufc
He sucks im sorry
He's absolutely burnt lol
Nate diaz doesn’t lie , straight facts !
In advance I wish Nate  speedy recovery.
what shitty camera is this shot on?
the diaz bros interview with brett are always so funny looks like a doctor talking to you about your mental stuff
Dude is so delusional its sad at this point.
Wish this Saturday was Nate Vs Tony but ya know.. it ain’t a perfect world
Nate is so honest about everything, a real fighter to the end!He deserves all the recognition and money since the company(ufc) is trying to punish him for him just trying to make some bread!Matchmaker Joe Silva would always to that to fighters who went against the company!
I really hope Nate pulls another big upset  and make Dana head  looks like fireball 😆 Imagine Nate becoming agent for up new  coming fighters 😳 Ok Brett  this was a great enterview but I have to go men !!😂😂 Nate doesn't give a dam , you gotta love him
If Khamzat KOs Nate with a slap, I will sht my pants
The man is not healthy! this fight literary can make  him die, shame on UFC making raising start vs old/dragged/tired (hall of fame fighter who helped to build this organization )
Ppl sleeping on nate that man been in more dog fight's than most of the UFC roster one thing's for sure nate bring's it each and everytime that's why we love that dude...Read this morning before fight before breakfast he's knocking out a triathlon.... that's gangster 😎
I’m hoping to see them go into deep waters with Nate getting a late rear naked to pull off the W
this guy real gangster brather
Bro nate is baked out his mind lmao
nathaniel
Nate is so gone he could be such a great fighter if he didn’t eat damage his whole life
why is this video so blurry, cmon espn
This fight will be hard to watch
Stockton va Stockholm slap
Please give us somebody other than "Boring" Okamoto to interview fighters. He is the worst interviewer of all time💯🥱🤷
Thanks for the memories Nate.  Loved this.  Respect 🤘🏼
Nate Diaz vs the world 🌎
Let’s enjoy Diaz whilst we still can. What a Legend
Rest in peace 🙏
Smoking 🔥 watching this interview
Let's go big dog Nate 💯💯
Head says Khamzat, heart says Khamzat.  This interview should have been done by Ariel.
His brain is fried from smoking all those drugs.  He’s got a job to speak with the anxiety.
The audio always sucks on these interviews. Sounds like a therapy session
i feel sorry for nate.......but you are the legend nate.......
fedoor milanko 😂😂
Brett is the worst interviewer ever
This setup looks like Brett saying "I can't let you get close" LOL
Let's get it Nate!!!!💯
NDA!!!  Love from Holland. The only fighter who already wins a fight at a press conference. Even if he loses.. he still wins.
CTE
2022 and ESPN still can't upload 1080p videos.
Nate's interview is twice as long as Khamzats but he said half as much... Let that sink in.
He looks wasted
Why do I always need +30% volume for these Okamoto interviews?
“Why did you call it road to war?” …. K. Good one.
NATE 'upset the system' DIAZ 2022.  Thumbs up if you are rooting for Nate to upset the system.
Nate leaving the UFC just as he entered. Ready for war.
Nate Shouldve stayed at 155 he doesnt belong at 170
Dana White is gonna lose his mind if Nate somehow takes out his golden goose like he did to Conor at UFC 196 on his way out of the UFC 😂
KILL OR BE KILLED ALWAYS
Pray for a quick 1st round stoppage.
Upvotes were at 209, feels bad I ruined it!
Let’s go Nate idgaf what nobody says !! 🖕🏽 Dana and the UFC
Sad when you realize this is the last time we are gonna see nate fight i really hope he pulls off this one 🤞🏻.
The scar tissue is what scares me… NDA for life though..
was it filmed by nokia?
What a absolute LEGEND!! 209
Rooting for Nate 🥳 I don’t agree with all Nate’s arguments but I like his logic and reasoning hahahaha 😏
My heart goes out to Nate and his family
Win or loss but this man is loved by all ,happy to see his interview ,and sad too cause dnt wana see either of guy losing the fight 🤧🤧
Dis is not a terapy session.
Imagine how amazing it would be if Nate wins.
He is going to Knee Khamzat and be known as Nate Knnnneeeaz
Respect to nate to taking the toughest fight on his final fight 💪
Nate keeps it real that's obvious. He can fight that's proven. Don't count him out Saturday lads 💯👍😇   After watching the whole interview a lot of what Nate says is painfully true
its incredible how espn still cant get lighting and audio correct
No Officer, its Hi how are you
Diaz a straight G for accepting this fight.  It's gonna be a car crash most likely for him
Diaz army, despite the fact everyone has the same assumption about this. Diaz army all the way!!
GOAT
Nate deserves better than they're treating him at the UFC everytime a fighter doesn't do what they tell them they start bullying these fighters that's why they don't say anything about it until they're out of the UFC, it's like they're scared of talking.
worried about nates health honestly. hope he wins, but dont see it happening. gonna be a big one if he does. an the health thing has been there for a while, guy can barely talk
We cant wait fight
Win or Lose Nate is a LEGEND and has been putting on his for City since day 1! Nothing but respect go out there and do what you do! Kill or be Killed!
Didn't expect to see this. Hope Nate can pull it off.
crème de la crème 😎 💯
This dude and his Brother gave us so much,best of luck bro.
Crazy how 1 win over mcnugget can keep a mediocre fighter relevant for over half a decade, Conor really is a king maker
With MMA, you just never know. Look at Usman vs Edwards.  All signs point to Khamzat getting the W, but you can never count a Diaz out.
why does Nate look like Thanos in the thumbnail
audio seems low
Og. Realest fighter on the roaster
👀💜
Khamzat by Doctor Stoppage+
This fight is a clear example to prove how dirty business minded Dana is😤
Literally clicked on the channel to see if they’ve interviewed Nate and it was uploaded 2 minutes ago, nice
Shoutout to Brock see ya at UFC 300

I’m nervous for this fight
I hope nate wins and put up the middle finger at Dana white
Cream de la Cream!🤣👍
Win or lose, Stockton’s Finest will forever be legends in this sport
Let's go baby NDA 💪💪💪 Nate Diaz ride or die Never jump a bandwagon don't care what the odds are
I hope Nate will enjoy his career at PFL/BKFC after his defeat.
My heart is saying Nate but my head is saying Khamzat by decision. It’s definitely not going to be an easy fight
Stockton !!
Nate makes saying nothing sound so interesting
Chael is the goat of mma that's all.
Diaz Army….U.S.A.
