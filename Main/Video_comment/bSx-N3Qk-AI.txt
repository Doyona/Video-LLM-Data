Alcoholic guy harry.
It's obvious who's alcoholic between theo and harry
15:02 I though i went colour blind for a second 💀
Fuck me that cap is bent
Y’all ain’t Theos mates for letting him rock that hat, good lord
The fact that paul was saying choccy

3:40
Hello there mate
perfume actually have laters tho thats why they have top notes middle note and base note
Theo is underrated lmfao
cals facial expressions everytime theo speaks >>
ethan has good taste, ma man
this just proves to me the power of branding.......
Colin in m&s is like £7.50. Mans got ripped off £25 for a Colin 😭😭
Harry looks baked.
where did he get £25 for a Colin, they’re only £7 🤣🤣
This is exactly why I buy cheap. I save money and my sh** looks just as good as anybody else's. I refuse to buy name brands. I don't think it's worth my money to just have someone's name stitched on something from Walmart. I buy for comfort. Now food I get a bit picky. I don't like generic bread or generic condiments. Things you should not buy cheap are condoms and pregnancy tests. The fact that the dollar store sells these things is why half of yall are pregnant and got incorrect test results
Naaaaaaaaaa 17:00 that voice craaack 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Harry loves his brie, Cal's done him dirty
I hate cal but I'm here for Harry😄
.   .   Calfreezy  L _____
I just fucking LOVE how Theo gets almost everything wrong, but is the most confident amongst all about his answer
love theo
I feel like ethan could be a judge on chopped
Really bad ad choice 80% of ur fanbase is 15 or under
17:01
Be like harry: Is a multmilionarie and still loves cheap stuff
Has any one noticed Calfreezy's laugh is identical to Voldemort? 🤣🤣
3:50 trust Harry to do that😂😂
Cook off ft Tobi
" it's made by peasants u can tell" - harold
😂😂😂Harry was funny with the wine it was gone so fast😅😂😂😂

Behz knows his foods😂 I think behz  has the best overall taste in things compared to other sidemen
“It’s made by peasants unfortunately” ~ Harry
Why is Harry’s juventus jersie so low quality 😂😂

Ethan really know his shit
The voice break sent me
14:07 me after I do a poo
Ethan just described a man I want to be
Moist flavour? Since when was moist a flavour
Anyone know where I can get Harry’s shirt
3:40
Fam how are they eating caviar with a silver spoon like bruh
Ayo Where is calfreezys hoodie from?
Lol a french youtuber (Joyca ) did the exact same concept over a year ago
this video shows that some stuff are better even if they dont cost that much
Give this underrated man his sub! He deserves it
Absolutely zero respect for you that you’re allowing a gambling sponsor on your channel even with your shitty disingenuous disclaimer 🥱
dope vid!
Ethan looks like shit 😂
Anyone else think ethans on some comedown 🤣
Sorry but Colin the caterpillar is NOT £25 it's £7
Cal deffo supplies the FOOD if u know u know 🍃;)
Yo... Did you change the containers on the caviar - the can that you said was cheap was the one printed with Prunier on the side of the can.
wheres Calfreezys hoodie from
If only this was a guess the quality of the coke Harry would be the champ
Sure brie was menna be Harry's favourite cheese like and yet he can't make out that it's a cheap version compared to another cheese
17:00 I cannot stop laughing at that voice crack 😂😂
Theo always makes these videos he’s too funny
Why does Ethan look like he has pink eye
Yo bez what happened to your arm? 8:24
The  thumbnail looks like a young  cheech and chong  😂
Look at 5:01
The thumb nail was so funny it looked like a budget Harry and posh Harry
What the fuck is Theo wearing on his head 🤣
i fucking love it when theo is consistently waffling, but confident about all of his thoughts and answers🤣🤣
I love how confidently wrong Theo is in every single one  but bigup to bhezi for being always right
It’s always the cheap is on the left and expensive on the right and they always try the cheap first
Why is Ethan going to 17 year olds house parties then
Proves money doesn't equal taste
Anyone else notice Ethan’s arm
Calling 9 pounds for a wine cheep is hilarious when im sitting here drunk on a saturday with my 1 Euro wine from across the street
I know they’re the same my ass
Do a nigerian cook off with the participants being: JJ And Tobi
17:01

This sensation is hitting more of my chakras😂😂
his laugh is what makes these videos absolutely hilarious
Hey there I was going to wish you well but I know you are well. I was going to wish you true fulfillment but i know you are complete already. You yes you are made perfect. Dont be afraid to pass by. Good day 🙏🏽👽🤗
Freezy just bangs out vids.  and never misses 🔥
lmao men just copied another youtuber, bruv you even made the damn thumbnail so similiar.
14:04 who else came from behzingas and aj tracey Instagram story 😂
I´ve got a question... at 16:12 is says the PRUNIER is the expensive one but when Harry guesses which on is the expensive on you can clearly see on the tin cup that it says PRUNIER 18:36.  Or am I getting confused with something ?
Guys don’t know shit about quality , guy with triple X bracelet is very good
Bruh tom Ford needs to hire Ethan. That was a glorious definition of oud wood

I love Harry 😂
All the girls came here for one reason - Harry
4:02 Ollie ball wanna be 😂
Harry is the ollie ball of alcohol
this is a banger of a video
meanwhile, comparing two wines made out of two different types of grapes
the way behz knew which collin juts by looking at it
Harry I know being an alcoholic is a bit of a running joke, but the way he downed that glass of wine is making me worried. Hope you're alright Bog :)
Cal:Every sip is a ten so enjoy it  Harry:Gulp gulp gulp well that was lovely
Ethan is so classy 😁
Literally 99% won’t see this but I lost my job due to covid. They shut down all the restaurants in Cook county which then led me to loosing my apartment. I'm currently living out of my car which I try and make the best of. I've applied to a bunch of places I'm hoping to get a call back. if anyone could help me with whatever you could bc I'm needing stuff like hand warmers which I stuff my clothes at night when it's cold. Also cheap burgers/fastfood. I know times are tough for everyone these days but if you're able to help me I have paypal username pay2winlife  If you're unable to help I totally understand thank you
Theo gettin heated over sunglasses🤣
Wait what, Colin the caterpillar is only 7 quid
“Tastes like fish fingers”😭😭

Fire Theo

Shouldn't be pushing poker mate.
NDL NDL

The difference between what Theo thinks he knows and what he actually knows is about the difference in the price of the two caviar pots.
What is up with Harry’s Juve shirt? Looks so ratty
Copy cat
Link doesn't work
This really sick white hoodie is from the brand derschutze_clo
Theo and cal are such a good duo, Theo on the fellas podcast was by far the best episode so far
Where did you buy the white hoodie?
what sweater is he wearing in the beginning, that white one
If the wine colour is deeper it’s more expensive
Niko Omilana for mayor #NDL
INSPIRED BY RUG
Theo : I’m a wine connoisseur  Harry : hold my wine
If there is 1 thing you learn in this video it’s that haroldbog loves a bev
Don’t remember Colin catipilars being £25
Freezy created the current Colin the Caterpillar beef, pass it on
Theo is such a melto
Love this
ooh thats tastes interesting. Oh wait it tastes exactly the same.
theo is fussy
Are we just going to ignore the fact that Ethan looks like he’s done 12 rounds with Tyson Fury?
Theo made this video very funny Hahah
Love the fact cal hasn’t used FT SIDEMEN or FT W2S BEHZINGA etc. Real certified content🤌
I just went so skip the sponsor section and got two ads, calsquidgy I like you but that’s criminal
Ethan sniffing cheese is hilarious
idk about where u live but i live in london and colin is only £7 in m&s
The derschutze hoodie 🚀
Harry ate the caviar like a fish lmao 😂
U didn't even give credit to rug
“Ohh, that’s interesting... tastes exactly the same” 😂😂
Great video but I needed more lol
Harry is definitely an alcoholic by the way he drank the wine.
Copy from faze rug
So were gonna forget the fact that at 11.51 harry is wearing his t shirt inside out😂😂😂🤣🤣😂
Willy
Ksi and his little crew are such goons!
Caviar is fucking stupid. Not being funny I'd rather eat a Pepperoni Pizza than fish eggs
Freezy lookin fresh!
go on Behz
Harry on a wine tasting course would be next level 😂
Harry actually has alcohol problem and no one knows cuz he’s just crazy in general
Some dumb cunts thinking Harry's Juventus shirt is fake but its actually real
Harry is an alcoholic. Y'all need to help him
Everyone go to new comments, you can see all the gen z nonces crying saying that Cal apparently copied the nonce known as Faze rug
I’m only here because of Harry I don’t really care about freezy 😂
they copied #FaZeRug
Calfeezy: "Let the babies drip down your throat" Theo: "It's quite salty" *Pause* 😳
When u get thumbnails by faze rug
Side note, Cal looking like a young Matt Hancock ngl
Thumbnail copied
who's gonna talk about the fact that Freezy got the caviar mixed up and fucked Harry and blessed Theo? :D Theo got it wrong Harry got it right
18:43 WAIT Freezy you fucked up you knoe that right? That tub literally has Prunier on it which is the expensive one so you kinda messed up there
Theo has to be doing it deliberately, right?
Anyone know the brand of Behz’s shirt?
Cal, I rate you. But you can't have a sponsor that promotes gambling when the majority of your fanbase aren't old enough to shave.
He who has ears to hear, let him hear  Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much the signs of the times are there and everywhere for all to see.  now is the day of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and Saviour understand that eternity is forever with no end no time God loves you so much but nothing is forced but the offer of salvation is there and the rejection of that is hell for all have sinned are guilty before the holy one the judge of all the living God   the judgement of God is near with all that happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you and for the things you’ve committed against God the sins you committed while on this earth so receive the forgiveness of God in Jesus   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
You tubers promoting gambling has to be the lowest of the lows.
Boring boring video
Wait I thought Colin was £7 or am I bugging 😂😂
wooooooooooow you sponser casino, not god
lol copied faze rugs thumbnail
The way though
If you could do one of these with Gordon Ramsey though
i feel powerful i have the like that makes it 3k
Wow i haven't seen that thumbnail in the faze rug latest video
Theo’s confidence is exquisite 💀
No cheap vs expensive cocaine for Harry?
Baker the absolute waffler🤣
It’s really not 10 per sip
Behz wearing that AJ Tracey merch
Why’s man still doing videos with malfoy
Sponsored by a gambling company and most of his audience are probably under 18, bit sus that mate
Another banger
Soon many people will vanish to God , and it will be chaotic on earth please repent to Jesus while you still have can . Idc if you are mocking me or what but please ask Jesus to reveals himself to you.Love ya.
BANGER!!!!
17:00 That voice crack from theo tho, lmao im dying
Ethan sounds like a mafia fic writer
Harry is jokes
Theo saying when I was a kid I went to a couple of churches sounded a bit mad 😂
why are they drinking wine out of a gin glass omgg
colin is not £25 LOOOOLLLL
You eat caviar with a metal spoon its going to taste the same
Theo makes himself look like a muppet in every video lmao!
The way Harry eats caviar is so weird, he does it every time, even in the sidemen holiday video
KEEP DOING VIDEOS LIKE THIS CALL👍🏼👍🏼
Theo is just roasting the expensive ones xD
Theo is just the biggest waffler of all time....
Theo is unintentional comedy gold
Harry:"I've had good caviar before it was a bit *nutty* " cal: facepalms
Where did u buy that hoodie?????
What I learnt from this video: Ethan's a man of taste and culture Theo's got the spirit but he's just a little confused Harry's an alcoholic
Since when has Colin been £25!!! I’d rather have Aldi’s version.
Yeah Theo knows nothin about sunglasses
What a sellout promoting a gambling to his young fans
This was an absolute top tier video! Well done Mr. Freezy 👏🏻

I’m ՏᑌᗷᗷIᑎᘜ TO EveryOᑎᗴ ᗯᕼO ᒪIKᗴ'Տ TᕼIՏ ᑕOᗰᗰᗴᑎT ᗩᑎᗪ ՏᑌᗷՏ TO ᗰᗴ ᗷᗩᑕK•.
his voice just sounds so weird now that he's spent a lot of time in Britain but came from America
M&S shafted you, Colin is £7
🎉
Its look how you copy faze rug video
banger
Derschutze hoodie 🔥
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that behz said he'd snog freezy hahahahahah
Theo man indeed!
you're meant to eat caviar off the back of your hand so you don't get the taste of the metal spoon
Calfreezy is the £100 version of w2s lol
Cal we know it's expensive you dont have to keep telling us
Need a cook off mate
@fazerug
I mean thumbnail looks a bit like faze rugs 😂
Theo spent all that money on his hairline but still has to wear a hat 😂😂 just shave it off mate, no shame in being bald!
Harry caried this vid
you done em dirty on the caviar. should've had them eat it of the back of their hand, or from a pearl spoon, as the metal flavour is absorbed from the spoon  great video nonetheless
The editing on this vid is sick
The cheap and expensive one were on the same side every single round
this is class! now, when's behz becoming the new ambassador for tom ford then?
Copied Faze Rug’s whole video lol
We say Ethan is dumb but he actually has a good noggin up there
Is Harry wearing his juve top inside out
cool !!!!!!
Sick video! Poker/gambling apps as sponsors tho not good
1:45 gordon ramsey vibes
How did Ollie ball not feature here....‼️
BANGER
why does no one get weller involved in stuff like this
ngl googled colin's price and its 7 quid, u either got scammed or clearly have no idea lol.
Just like faze rugs video at least give props to him, if you didn't know faze rug did this I'm sorry
Why does behz look like hes had a fight with a bear
ethans explanations and thought process in this made me develop a new crush 😭
ethan just made this video deluxe
having theo in videos just makes it so much funnier ahaha
The fat boy still lives in ethan
I’ve got a taste for caviar 😂
Behzinga turns into prime ollie ball
More of these
metal spoon with caviar. SMH
Took it from faze rug
theo: “i’m a wine connoisseur”  also theo: never tried red wine in his life
ffs lad release the 2nd part of the interview we all are waiting !!!!!!!
MANS SAID CAVIAR TAKES LIKE FISH FINGERS LUL
3:44 was the best part of the video by far.  “That was lovely”
We want another cooking video
behz is a beazt
behz: spot on in cal's video  fails in his own eating cheap and expensive video
Anyone gonna tell Harry that his shirt is inside out
Cal said its 10 pound a sip when Harry was taking a sip of the expensive
Wow! so you doubled down on sleezing with shitty sponsors. That's a turn off.
What was on Theo’s head
Thats not that bAaD
Harry wearing the jersey opposite got me XD
Cal is da goat bruh
Lowkey need a Cook Off with BambinoBecky
It's made by peasants 😭😭
What is that ending? 🤔
Theo “ Not trying to be funny” baker
Dude behz needs to have a try/review channel this dude has taste he knows whats good
M and s Collin is not 25 quid
Loving the content lately!! Send it
Should’ve did the cheese with Simon, we probably would’ve got it so easy
should you really be promoting gambling to your young audience cal?
Moist flavour??
that's a sick hoodie freezy is wearing. anyone know where to get one?
Faze rug
theo looks like jake paul
Why does cal like to stare at people’s mouths when they talk
Nah Behz too op
Bruh this video had me dead🤣🤣
Theo is so underrated , he's funny and seems like a really genuine person
3:45 I’m dead
Keep up the amazing work Freezy🙏
Do anything with gib  It would be so much fun
*Harry downs two whole wine shots*  Vik: This man DRINKS!
Where's Big Gibber
calfridge videos have been bangers recently
FAZE rug legit uploaded the same video idea lmfao
3:45  We all knew Harry wasn’t leaving a drop of wine in that glass😭
Why would you promote gambling AT ALL? I thought of you as a responsible person who genuinely cared for your audience's well being. "We are being faced with a gambling addiction pandemic during and in the aftermath of the coronavirus. Current evidence suggests that the number of people experiencing gambling addiction is on the rise. The data indicates a significant uptick specifically with online gambling. So much so that it has forced political leaders, gambling councils, and the industry itself to place restrictions on the frequency of betting and amount that can be bet as well as on advertisements that promote gambling." I thought you were better than this Cal. I'm disappointed.
Harry: can i have a little sip?  *proceeds to down the whole drink* lmao
2:05 "If you go too high class or fancy... usually the food is shit" So true man... everytime I've eaten in a "super fancy" place it's been food with disgusting flavor combos... or super small portions.. that just look aesthetically pleasing lmaoo. Like yea it looks cool, sounds fancy, costs a lot..... but it's shit.
My mans Tryna say Collins £25...hes £7 lad😂
Yess
This one was so good
WHATS THE SONG AT 5:53 !  Plz let me know i been researching
"It was made by peasants" 😂
Didnt even give credit to faze rug for this idea
lux and freezy videos are getting SOOO much better lately... props to u legends you deserve more attention
hi
I love how Theo just waffles with confidence
Behz knows his food
Theo has absolutely no clue ahahahah
Bruv poker is haram 😌
Ethan = god Harry = average Toby = shit
Theo is one arrogant dude on camera isn't he 😂
Almost every video Theo's in, he's overly confident, gets something horribly wrong, then makes excuses 😂
when Theo gets it wrong.. 'but that's the reason I said ...' haha
Love to see these type of vids
Freeze hoodie clean af
All this video proves is how normie their palate's are LMAOOOO
he ruined the vine taste by saying Remember each sip Is a 10
16:13 Harry guessed the prunier caviar as the expensive one  but got it wrong
How long does that Tom Ford stick around for before disappearing and needed to be reapplied?
7:09 Cal moving mad
Colin does not cost £25 mate
Yo the thumbnail and the title is the exact same from faze rug vid IM NOT A HATER I LOVE FREEZYS VIDS
POGGERS
Pound land jake Paul there with the blue hat 😂
Love Harry, but where did he get his juventus shirt from wish or Ali express?🤣
All I learn from these videos is that Theo is a loveable idiot
NDL
Harry likes cheap stuff
You really copied FaZe Rugs video 💀
Cal is banging lately
5:58 Sainsbury’s? Isn’t it aldi
The way behz sees food is incredible
Does anyone know what hoodie freezy is wearing?
Freezy’s content lately has been so inventive. Keep it up
Theo is an actual doughnut
Behz being like a proper critic lol
Is Ethan Ok? he looks like so like unwell
Why does Behz always have his left arm red?
Why does they look all so high af ;)
sponsored by a betting company. do better cal.
Ethan is fucking good at this wow
Colin from M&S is only like 7 quid
the idea that colin the caterpilla is £25 is just false, it's like half that
Theo is such a clown lmao
The thumbnail looks like a break up vid
One of the best vids I’ve seen in a while
You could at least give FazeRug some credit for the idea. But great vid 👍🏽👍🏽
POV: Faze Rug at home
You should do a roommates cook off, you and Harry vs Simon and JJ, would be jokes
Me realising that cal takes 20 sips to finish an entire bottle of red wine
Is Calfronzwick wearing Derschutze?👀
Justice for cuhbert !!!
M£S
Harry might be a raging alcoholic
He copied FaZe Rug's video 💀💀
Does anyone know the song at 17:35?
Colin isnt £25 its £7
Not really a fan of the sponser with this audience can't lie
What’s on Malfoys head
This is jokes😂😂😂😂😂😂😂theo killed me and Ethan knows his ishhhh
Do it with clothes!
Behzinga wearing AJ Tracey Merch... things you love to see!!
Just finished a whole bottle of red wine to myself hahahaha
Lmao Theo says it wiv chest n it’s funny that every time his wrong 🤣
Lol 80% of your fans are under 18 but good job on getting a gambling sponsor. They didn't think that one through
Harry got the caviar question right at 18:44 as the tin says "Prunier" which was the more expensive one
putting 10k on red because of you now cal
Colin is not 25 quid get out of here
What's wrong with Harry's T shirt? lmao
banger cal
Malfoy's voice crack omds ahahahaha 17:00  #NDL #raami
Well guess that was the end then
That Juve kit looks horrid
didnt even credit faze rug smh... sike
You don't eat caviar with a silver spoon... Use a gold or plastic one
Did harry draw the juventus kit on a regular shirt..🤣
Mad vid but when you used the metal spoon with caviar I died inside
Theo is just Jay from the Inbetweeners
Collin the caterpillar is £7, not £25
17:01 Theo's voice just said "nope"
Collin the caterpillar is £7, not £25
Collin the caterpillar is £7, not £25
Theyve forgotten my guy cuthbert
Harry and alchohol mix well
Banger vid bro
Nobody gonna talk about Harry’s jersey
Nowhere is Colin the caterpillar £25 looool why lie there’s no need
no Collin costs £25
What m&s you shopping in!? £25?!?! Its like £8 normally!
We need more of these
Why didn’t u do this with Ollie ball? Missed chance there cal
are we gonna mention that harry's shirt is inside out
i was about to unsubscribe like i did with callux but this video saved it!!!!
Theo is to much. He never doubts himself, but he is always wrong. ha ha
BANGERRRRRR
the quality of cal’s videos has been incredible lately
1:45 is when video starts
Trust Harry to get the Alcohol one right
No one gonna say that ethans hair looks hella fire here? Like damn
Please don’t take sponsors from gambling sites really not cool
W
Same thumbnails as faze rug lol
Who clarted Behz?
Theo being so confidently wrong with the sunglasses was hilarious 😭😭
Expensive : W2S Cheap  : Calfreezy
Anyone else confused about the caviar? When showing them side by side it said the Prunier was the expensive one but when Harry guessed it Cal said it was the cheap one, even though Harry pointed to the one with Prunier written on it haha
You need to add ft. W2S in the title to get the bang views
Harry's beard tho
Freeze definitely makes the best content of all the troops
Theo has the taste buds of a 12 year old...
Cal is my fav
Colin the caterpillars are 7 quid not 25 😂
So, no reddit? Aight
Theo is the biggest waffler
itch nose and touched cake...aw ok then
Theo is hilarious 😂
Harry the alcoholic connoisseur
does anyone know where his hoodie is from
My mans content is elite. Top tier👌🤌
You can’t eat caviar with a metal spoon, it messes with the taste!
Am I the only one that skipped all of the bits theo was in
£25 for a catapillar cake. Wtf are M&S smoking
Ahh yes, cal advertising a gambling website to his mostly under 18 fan base
Casino ads really aren't the one, I know the money's good and that but promoting gambling of any sort is pretty dire. I already know i'm going to be told that poker isn't gambling or something because it's a 'skill based game' or some other shit, but please don't bother.
Theo is refreshing to watch
Behz is living lavish I see 🤣
Colin the caterpillar is £7 you fraud
Harry and cal in a vid is always a banger
You got mugged if you paid £25 for that cake lad, £7 RRP. Gotta get that title tho
Cal is such a goat.  Wish he wouldn't take sponsorship from gambling. (Equally I know man's gotta eat) but he got influence and some responsibility you know?
Great video and execution
Pain when you pay that much money for caviar for someone to say it tastes like fish fingers 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
17:01 that's the fish babies fighting back in his throat
Gosh Cal, your Marks and Spencer's is expensive Colin the Caterpillar is only £7 not £25 hahaha, great video tho
THEO has trust issues
where can i get that white jumper from?
here after moresidemen, and nikos videos 😂
Since when is a collin the caterpillar cake £25?
Ngl I thought Harry was wearing a normal juventus football shirt until the end lol
14:19
really exposing harry for an alcoholic there
Theo's expressions got me everytime 🤣🤣🤣
That beard is coming along
I’ve never been gifted anything in my life that app won’t change it😔
What is your opinion on ginger rights?
Faze rug thumbnail and videos has been copied
hi
theos a legend, you should do it with chip, I feel like he would get almost every one wrong
Is calfreezy and Harry the cheap and the expensive items too?
Listen to 16:48 with your eyes shut.....
Derschutze gang
Thats not that bÄD!
Colin is actually £7 not £25. @calfreezy
ethan lowkey started to describe kazuma kiryu at 14:58
freezy to 5 mil
Control Harry's Twitter PLEASE
Theo had the worst video of his life probably lmao, got most of the item wrong + one of the funniest voice cracks I’ve ever heard. hahahahah that was so funny man
Ethan seemed so smart in this video
Colin is not £25 pounds, no idea what boujee M&S Calfreezy shops at
Ethan knows his food!
what M&S are you shopping at!! normal colins are £7 😭😂
294 th comment
* sad faze rug voices *
I swear he put the items in the same order almost every time lol, cheap- our left side, expensive - our right side.
BIG BOUJEE BEHZ
Nice outro
Damn faze rug just made that vid
Man like Cal
Expensive vid
Dimly You
Harry is right,  the left one is Prunier while the right one is Adam's which is the cheap one. Check the close up.
hey calfreezy you have to give fase rug the vid idea you got it from him
Behz just knows his stuff
Theo had a stinker 😂😂
Ethan is to food like what JJ is to Spotify monthly listeners.
You got the caviar the wrong way round for Harry's
Theo is actually so funny man 😂😂
A few years ago i was in a factory in China that made the rams for excavators. Thousands came out at the end and went to different areas for paint. Some yellow (caterpillar), orange (Doosan) etc. all had massive differences in price yet all from the same factory and same materials. Most of the time (not always) , all you are paying for is the brand.
What ive learnt from this. Malfoy has one of the worst pallets ive ever seen
Theo baker is HILARIOUSSSSSSSSS
I miss callux uploads
"It's made by peasants you can tell"  LOL
The sunglasses one legit says st luant
“More potent”- Harry Confirmed smoked weed
Think Harry’s on some 🌱
someone stole their video idea of Faze rug 😂
Fire 🔥
ngl ethans trim looks shite now
Theo’s voice crack was everything. Am literally crying😂
Didn't someone get pretty bad backlash ages ago for having a betting app as a sponsor
What happened to behz right eye fam
Banger after banger
Collin is £7...
It’s strange that faze rug made the exact same video but 2 days ago and it had glasses on the video ?
Is Harry wearing his shirt inside out????
Theo really is turning into a keen cyclist, Cinelli casquette and all
Theo being so confident every time and absolutely failing💀😭
No one talking about he didn’t cred FaZe Rug
Im 22 but the responsible gambling disclaimer made me respect you all the more
3:45 harry you ok lad
Harry wearing his shirt upside down again
Rug copy
sell out for sponsors
NDL
Theo couldn’t have been more wrong and it was incredible to watch
LOLB CALFREEZY IS A DICK
i love how Theo has a cycling cap on
Freezys smile is so contagious
Man copied Faze Rug’s video title and thumbnail lmaoo
It said beside the items if it was expensive so they already knew
16:49 “let the baby drip down ur throat”
Two freezy uploads in one day, blessed
Harry: being scientific And trying to be smart Theo: making faces  Ethan: banging it because there’s food
17:00 Theo’s voice crack
think your m&s is overcharging you if you paid £25 for a cake that's normally £7 😭😭
I laughed so much at theos reaction to the wine
Is Harry’s shirt inside out?
Why was Harry so scientific in this 😂😂😂😂😂
The actual love i have for harry
theo exists in his own realm of sensory input
Theo time and time again makes himself look an idiot...😂😂😂
Theo man "I dont like red wine" "Have you ever had red wine?" "No"  "It smells like church" "Do you go to church?" "No"
the cheese they used as cheap is the one I buy when I'm feeling fancy LMAO
Bangers only🙂🙂💯💯💯
Anyone else respect Harry’s dodgy jersey 😂🤣
Coppied faze rug
Copoee gaze rug wow maybe
I haven’t watched the video yet, but if there’s alcohol in it, I expect Harry to get all of it right
The way Theo has so much confidence in all his explanations but is completely wrong is hilarious 😂
theo baker is a fraud
We love Theo Baker ❤️
Where is Cals hoodie from?
Tf is on theos head
Copying FAZE RUGGG
2:16 Says 'Cask 25' whilst the label literally says 'Cask 23'
Why Ethan's arm is red?
17:27 He said a dark joke Harry 2 seconds later : can we continue that topic?
How the fuck did Harry neck that wine like it was water 👀
😂 Harry has his shirt on backwards the dafty
Theo gotta be the most annoying human
COLIN THE CATERPILLAR ONLY COSTS £7
Wtf is that on theos head?!
Anyone else recognize the background music from MM7Games?
Why 888 poker. Ffs I see enough of those ads
Haven’t watched the video but I just know it’s a banger!
ayyyyyyyy
absolute banger again! love your vids
what the fuck is Behz saying about Chakra 😂🤣
kind of impressed by behz ngl
Theo looks like a melon with that hat on
I cant escape this fucking caterpillar cake discussion
what kind of cap is Voldemort wearing
This looks like faze rugs thumbnail..
The same video a Faze rug
Don't partner up with Gambling companies.
Wtf is that on Theo's head
Damn, why did you eat me?
One thing I know is Ethan knows his food very well
I mean its obvious when its tom ford, because most of the tom ford perfume is made out of oud 😂   purfume suggestion: buy the Tom Ford "Ombre Leather" its amazing. 🤩
What's that hoodie?! I need that ASAP!!
That's not that bAaAaaAd
Omg the way Ethan described Tom Ford without knowing it’s Tom Ford 😭😭😭😭😭
Since when does Colin the Caterpillar cost £25!? Pretty sure it's only £7!?
Harry downing the whole wine is kinda giving me similar vibes
Does anyone knows how to buy the Harry Juve kit? Pls answer
who's hungry as fk
Bro thats a wack thumbnail
17:00 Great voicecrack
3:50 its lovely, harry u absolute legend!!!
Dunno how I feel about advertising gambling sites, but fair play to making sure people know the risks. That's more than regular TV does
What is Harry’s top
Absolutely smashed it. Most content on YouTube these days sucks. Cal vids are only getting better.
I guess Ethan likes the cheap stuff even tho he is rich.  Whereas Harry like the  Expensive one more
The boys love a Freezy upload
Theo was really bad at this 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So cal basically put expensive things on the right
18:03 I’m sorry but Harry eats like a fish
With Harry in a video yk it finna be a banger
What ever Theo says about stuff in life, go with the opposite answer.
Theo is a British jake Paul, u can’t change my mind
I didn’t realise Colin was £25 that’s mad for a mass produced cake
Theo in this vid was fucking class🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙏
”Its horsecock”
Copying off sortedfood

How to get views: put Harry in the thumbnail
3:38 Asks for a sip and proceeds to down the whole thing classic Harry move
Uhhhhh I see I see coping FaZe Rug I see 😂

The voicecrack killed me 😂😂
