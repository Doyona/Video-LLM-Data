This song lives rent-free in my head. B7 is timeless.  "You know I love you from down deep within, you're my best friend, when we're together it feels like forever."❤
2025 😊
Brandy’s voice is like fine wine and smooth like silk.
I can’t stop watching this one. ❤
The Vocal Bible  ❤
The vocal Bible
I was too young when brandy came out to appreciate how crazy of a singer she is. But now I got time lol
I adoreeeeee her
Just saw her and Monica live. And Brandy is def top 5. 31 years and she’s remained consistently amazing! Deserves all her flowers!
Could you teach me how 2 sing??????
🎉❤I have always ABSOLUTELY LOVED HEARING BRANDY'S BEAUTIFUL ANGELICAL VOICE. Monica as well. Brandy, I heard about rhe concert. Lady, please drink   at least 4  16.9 bottles of water per day & everything you urinate, put it back in your body. Just drink some more. The more you drink, the more your body will become used to the water intake & you won't urinate as often. If you are a person who urinates a lot, go to the urologist, you may have an over active bladder. Take care of yourself, we missed a lot of you. We were pleased to see you & Monica back together. Just make it up, the fans will be get over it. Have patience with your sister Monica. The devil is a liar & the truth is not in him.  To God be the Glory❤🎉
Ain’t nobody and I mean NOBODY is  touching Brandy, you hear me! She’s in her own lane… better yet her own planet! 🎧🎶🙂‍↕️💗

Anyone try this out.... Have a conversation with her as the music play and she if it does or doesn't correlate to what you are saying or feeling in the moment. If it doesn't work that okay too. I can have 1000, or conversation with this video as if it a phone call and it still make sense. Sometimes it hit different when you going thru something and this song (along with image) randomly start playing. Thank you. Hopefully you eat today. Take Care. (I.C.U, U.C.Y./Y.C.U, U.C.I)
Thank You God. Thank you Brandy Norwood!!! This video came in clutch at the right time more than a few occasions.
Yes I'm still a fan. Love your voice & you.❤

Queen B!! 👑 🙌🏾 🔥🔥🔥

On repeat for hours 🤎🤎🤎🤎
Brandy can do ANYTHING!! HER VOICE IS DO NOSTALGIC AND HER RANGE IS UNMATCHED. IT IS DIFFICULT TO BE INDIVIDUAL IN AN INDUSTRY THAT WANTS TO PUSH A COOKIE CUTTER FAKE STANDARD. BLESS, Queen Brandy.
This is a hit❤
This is on replay in my car, house, erwhere!
honestly artists back then knew how to perform with SOULLL!!! Brandy has been another level from timeee ago! thats my girl!!
I always loved Brandy song!! ❤ and of course I love this one too!! Her vocal range is amazing!! ❤️
The “Roni” by Bobby Brown sample goes crazy
Man ….. she is in her own lane. KILLED THIS!!!!
B.Rocka is the THE TRUTH! THE LEGEND & one of our GOATS! 🐐✨️👑💎 I love u Brandy! 🥰
Vocal Godess
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PERFORMANCE!!! TIMELESS VOICE!!
That's a darkchild beat it's very similar to truth on the full moon album one of my fav songs. Only brandy could do that beat justice. Am I right is he the producer?
❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man brandy can sing to me anytime, I’ve been a fan since the beginning 💯
A tone like no other. This was fire
When my 2 year old yells “Again” when a song goes off that’s not Cocomelon you know it’s magical.
❤❤❤
NEVER GET TIREDDDDD!!! sing that throat off Brandy !!
Always on point🔥🔥🔥🔥
How did I miss this? Omg....girllll❤
Wow! Chills❤
We love you dear.
Amazing!!
Why she gotta look so good. If I could afford her I'd shoot my shot......
Omg listening to this queen in this years.... Is soo so so calming and divine. 😮❤ Omg the artists back then were so different and when they come today they fill the voids that the new generations of musicians can't touch
Wow, vocals. Performance! Passion! My stank face was on the whole time 😂
It’s Brandy’s choices on runs and riffs that get me. Her vocal decisions are smart, invigorating, smooth, gritty, soulful. It’s the same reason I ❤ some others like Deitrick Haddon and Stokely.  Those singers are  calculated and always adding up!❤❤❤
My Goat
Victoria Monet wrote it! ❤
i have watched this over 50 times and i am consistently blown away
I mean. Just beautiful.
It's crazy how many Ariana Grande fans are really Brandy fans but they don't know it😝

As I've said before Brandi is in a class by herself So beautiful and an amazing voice TIMELESS
The things I would do to learn the vocal technique of this legend. Its something about an artist that FEELS the music as they sing. It just flows through them. ❤❤❤ Brandy can and will sing most artists into retirement.
Vocal range, passion, depth of vocal chords, perfection made in heaven.can u imagine her doing a gospel album with this voice.
I rather be 😢😢😢😢
The Dilla vibe on that beat drop. My God.
Proudly a formerly-ignorant Gen Z just recognizing her talent. ❤❤ #LongLiveBrandy !!!!!!!!!
I adore her so much. Ahe just has such a unique way of singing and it will forever and ever and ever pit a smile on my face
❤❤❤❤ Super Nice
I'm speechless
Love it!!! All love from South Africa  🇿🇦 ❤️
I look forward to giving you a hug Brandy. I knew what music was, when I first heard your voice back then in ages. Love you. Rex from Nigeria.

My favorite vocal octaves are the lower tones. So sultry and earthy. Just the most beautiful sounds. I love all her voice but the lower tones hit on a different level in my opinion.
That run on 2:03😮 Just amazing❤😊
How does she still remain the GOAT after all these year!!😮😮😮❤❤look at that bod👌🏽…voice range is crazy! Look at Marian Carey, she is Done!! 😅

There’s no one like Brandy😩❤️the amazing thing is that she’s been singing like this since she was young I’m talking about 10 years old with this type of voice control and as she got older it got better & better.. she still sounds good. To me she is probably one of thee best when it comes to clean runs & riffs control I have ever heard in my life, this is why she’s called the vocal Bible🔥💪🏾🙌🏾🙏🏾

My favorite part 0:57-1:03. Classic Brandy sound. Her voice has a sound that magically brings back the days of the greats. Some of the notes for some reason reminds me of Michael Jackson.
Young Lady you sang that song! Your voice is still fierce as ever!!!👏👏👏👏👏❤
Pure walking magic. Nothing but my highest respect. Brandy sits in my heart right under Mariah and Jesus.
Love this
Brandy damn! Still slaying we love you and that beast of a voice
Lauryn Hill, Brandy, Jasmine Sullivan... everyone can go home after that... for eternity. There's literally nothing left to talk about after that. In that order. PERIODT!

Her vocals have gotten even better with time and she was a beast back then. Smooth and rich leads and those harmonies-don't think even Boys ll Men topped them. I would buy a whole album of your old songs done like this.

She really really started going in harder by that second verse! She was like "okay, y'all are too relaxed now, let me go off!" 🔥🔥😍

I'm the last of the great '79er's..  there will never be a generation of great artist around my age or my age like Brandy.. R & B come back!!
The vocal replay value in this video is crazy!!! I literally had to stop this video rewind and play it back it’s so many amazing moments in this vocal performance it’s insane. I’m like how?!?!?!?? 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Brandy's voice continue to evolve in astounding ways. Even when we think we've heard the best of her, she finds new artistry. Her continual dedication to music is a gift to this world.
Ain’t nooooooobody messing with brandy hands down she so authentic and reeeally can saaaang not sing 💯💯🔒🫡🔥🔥🔥🤟
Ugh I love her! ❤
Violet is a color of fantasy 💜 Today your songs and songs of Ray-J became more attractive. Don't ask how. It's rather a "why" question.
Her voice and talent was underrated she was the original sza, her.
Ladies and gentlemen, THE VOCAL BIBLE 🥰😍❤️🤎
Damn. I honestly had forgotten about brandy even though I’ve always liked her. This is insane
Nice!
*RNB IS ALIVE AND WELL* 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿💐💐⚘️

Yessss Brandy
😲😲😲😲 I’m at Awh 🫠
I have watched this at LEAST 20 times. How this doesn't have millions of views is beyond me.
Old is gold
She’s back? I’m very happy 😊
MASTERCLASS
Excellent! Her and Nao should do something together ❤.  Their voices would blend beautifully.
I still think if this was a lead single after Borderline, her album would have soared... I have no idea why she or they chose "Baby Mama" as a lead single (just watched baby mama video again - she kills everything she does lol, but single no)
She is so pretty
SHINE ON...brandy NO red wine.......thats ageing with style. NO WORDZ....simple stunning, you helped me get throughma troubles through Canada when i went there with the release of the 90s albums...luv
Fire 🔥🔥💯
She's pure magic
I FREAKIN LOVE HER!!! OMG BRANDY THAT VOICE
Wow she is a lady.
Girl you bettah saaaang! You showed up and showed out!!!😁
Her voice is literally gold. I’m glad I learned from her cuz she is a vocalists vocalist. She is a singers singer. She literally has paved the way for so many of us to be bold in our tone but also be thoughtful and truly musical with our voices. Hats off to you queen Brandy… you are the real queen B in my book FIVE-EVER!!!

Sumptuous vocals.  OK - 200 sit-ups today.
This song touches so different and deeply brandy
MAAAAN THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG ON THAT ALBUM
I miss the 1990's. #brandy
That was a masterclass. The arrangement of this song is no joke too, super complex stops and time changes.
Just gorgeous! She need no cosmetic surgery. Plus her music is off the change!
This is a good vibe ❤️
Brandy you have been amazing since the 90's.... Your legacy is unmatched. Would be such an honor to meet HER!!!! GO QUEEN
Brandy does not age at all. She has been my favorite singer every since she started.

I can't agree more with all the TRUE Fans of BRANDY who commented below. Sooooo Many amazing Comments for OUR Queen Brandy. I am truly blessed to be a FAN from Thea, on to everything our Queen has ever done. I am always amazed and mesmerized by our QUEEN. Thank you COLORS and BRANDY for this. A true FAN here 4Ever. Oh and Please allow me to say thank you for all the Bran Nu FAN's for everything you gave us from Her too. Your WORK on Queen's had me JUMPING out my SET worst than I was with FOX Lee Daniels STAR. I can't wait to see all you continue to share within our WORLD. There is truly no one like you BRANDY. I LOVE You so much TRULY....
isnt this Ray J's sister? shes pretty good
So smooth 😍😍😍 Ray J should take notes
I believe her voice is the best out there
Beautiful song!
She will forever shine like no other... Her vocals are what most singers dream to have.. Keep the music flowing.. Love me some Brandy!!
I never knew she was an actual singer lol, thought she only sang for Queens.
She REALLY needs to collab with Beyoncé omg. Imagine
there needs to be a lesson on that last run because wtf!!!!!!
I love her, always been and will be my favorite artist…
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
how did i not know about this til rn im crying
Its nice to see a singer from the rnb era on colors. I always had this crush on brandy from the tv shows haha
Good lord 😩
Brandy killed it she is the R&B queen Beyonce is the first queen and then it's Brandy it's only 2 PERIOD!!
One of my friends in HS said she just recently moved to NYC from Haiti and the only America thing she knew was....and I quote, "Brandy and Michael JacksUHn" and that was in '05 loll  Sb I think we all forgot how popular this woman truly was and is.  She may no longer be in her Era but using the word "underrated" for Brandy is just crazy to hear for a girl who grew up in the 90s!
UNMATCHED WITH IT EVERY SECOND <3
I Love her Voice it's so Amazing!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I get hyped everytime she does that WOOOO at the 2:08 mark! 😂🥰🥰🥰 Her voice is beautifully painted and so delicate and babyyyy that mic was on!!! You hear me!!! 😂😂 B ROCKA YALL! 🤎🤎
Song hits different when you're falling in love
She works a camera! Like no other.
Her & Beyoncé would make this a number one hit!
I feel like I just got a front row seat of her when she in the studio.
How awesome would it be if she did her throwbacks like this too??? I play the Full Moon album heavy on repeat, and while the whole album is FIRE, if I could hear "Nothing", "He Is", "Come A Little Closer" and "Love Wouldn't Count Me Out" live I would die happily. Brandy's vocals have always been A1 and people are sleeping on her older records!!!  💜Peace

Brandy's music is a definition of the word "perfect"♥. Listening to her music gives me mental and emotional stability. It brings me serendipity.
#I💙BRANDY# #PERIOD# #THEBRANDYTHONCONTINUES#
Borderline in live ?😍
Fire 🔥 🔥🔥
I want thick brandy back ..she looked extra delicious with that weight on her 😋😜😋😜
too much reverb
its too produced, its not really a live. its like listen a music studio. need to be minimalist, roots
Her voice has developed and grown so much. I remember listening to her in the '90s with Miss Aaliyah and Monica and they were all my favorites
Lawwwwd have mercy !!! coz Brandy's voice is just a breath of fresh air. I'm hypnotized #VocalBible
I mean like THE Woman!!!
I love Brandy!! Her vocals are Soo underrated!
Never has ever existed a smoother vocalist. Brandy!
Her background vocals gives me chills. She just put on a clinic.
Don’t play with people who sound better live than on their record . I Stan forever !
It’s been a month & I’m 🗣STILL - 👏🏾NOT - 👏🏾OVER -👏🏾 IT!
8:56 pm 8/15/2022
please do “plastic on the sofa challenge” 🔥 🔥 🔥
Everyone who knows this song was like:  "WTF"  When she changed those lyrics at the beginning 🤣
queen
💙💙💙
💗💗💗
Half these views are probably mine.
Brandy will always be THE G.O.A.T.
My favorite singer since I first heard her voice on "Thea" the love for her craft has not changed.. hands down 🌻 she's my fave without hesitation... BRANDY!!!
Amazing. That voice.
Phenomenal 🤩🤩 I need her and Jazmine Sullivan on a song pronto
Love Brandy❤️
On repeat
Finally you gonna get the recognition u deserve.. Sing girl
Brandy, always comes with it, period !!
Amazing
can't believe this is live, is it recorded and she's lip syncing ?
1:46 lol fire
Watch it too many time
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏🏽🔥
Beautiful queen 🥰🥰🥰🥰.
❣️
I can sing but she's a monster and i consider myself as a beast on the beat but damn Brandy's vocals is amazing
I'm eating her gorgeous groceries off top!
This woman can sang!
This one really grows on u
Brandy killed this bih 🔥 🔥🔥
We hated her in HS...wow go girl
Queen❤️
Brandy my Angel 🌹 You got a friend forever onwards. Keep shining your Sunshine, Heart & Soul in this world through your music. Stay happy Legend 😉☀️ 🌹☀️🌹☀️
WTF..listen to these vocals..like this is insane how much control she has. I'm so sick of Brandy not getting her flowers like she deserve.  Also, let talk B7...that album gave some of the best vocals I ever heard from any artist and she had a lot good songs.  Now that she is signed with a new label I'm hoping she get backed more.  This woman deserve her awards.
When she sings, I'm hypnotized 🤭🤩
Omg.......the way she sung*faints......*gets up .....this damn song....*faints again
Why she just snatched the lil edges I have left 🥴🥴🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I feel like I grew up with her.  I still watch Moesha and I have all of her music and listen to it while I’m renovating my home.    I am so proud of her!  She’s my friend in my head!😆♥️
B be in a pocket that grabs your soul.....yall feel me?  It's people that can sang....sure....but it's always the tone for me.   It grabs my soul!  It's only a few that got it like that, Whitney Houton, Anita Baker, toni braxton.....to name the very few.  Brandy is on that list!  That tone and control on the vocal ability gets in my bones and takes over!  That is a rarity u will not find even among your faves!!!!
BRANDY YEEEESSSS  ANS THAT SUITE  had to look it up. too much for me but looking for a dupe
I done watched this bout fifty-leven timesssss
Wake up ours girl give more 🌹
Brandy, Brandy Brandy!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☄️
I'm going practice 😛. Brandy being inspiring people to sing in the shower lol
YOU CAN’T TOUCH BRANDY..
Yassssss Brandy!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Soooo glad she did this song again. It's waaaay better than the studio version. She put ALL types of STANK on this version!! When she put her hands on her hips, it reminded me of Whitney. Brandy was all up & through the bag on this one! Her runs are just crazy good. She's just magical on this version.  Is THIS version available to purchase??
The vocal Bible !
She is my favorite rnb female singers ever, she is a goddess. I'm french and I admire her voice and technique for her backgrounds vocals. This is GOLD.
0:53-0:55 🙇🏾‍♀️ 📕
my favorite part is on 1:49 when she said oh'yeah ...... you betta give me emotion and paint me  a pictuer! you ate'that doowwnnn
Amazing vocal
Victoria Monét's pen game is so strong! This is song was made for Brandy's ethereal vocals! These bridges, harmonies, and tones are chef's kisses.
Always have had such a beautiful voice
FM radio needs to put our 90s artist back on the radio or give them they own station cause a lot of em still making great music. like Bone Thugs still doing shows never stopped making music but we don't get to hear there voices shine like they did because DJs or whomever running these FM radio hip hop and r&b stations. like Indianapolis
Wow wow wowwww
Just WOW!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm not even in love but this song makes me feel like I am! just pure perfection Queen 🌹🤎
Love Brandi but Colors not what it used to be. I used ro discover new artists on here... Now Brandi is here🙄🙆🏾‍♀️

My ALL TIME FAVORITE!!! Hands down NOBODY matches you B-Rocker.. I don't see why you're not on everybody's songs these days... This is on repeat like all the others❤️ Sounds like "tenderoni" by Bobby Brown is what I hear a little too..
Three minutes of tone, airy perfection, perfectly placed runs. Chest voice to head and back to chest. The vocal Bible never disappoints. I will always STAN.

Brandy sounds sooooooooo fck'n good !! 🥺😩😻🔥 & i love this song rather be her vocals are so beautiful, brandy always been my fav. 👑
Whitney is watching looking and still guiding from the other side. No lie.it was a line of riff's and runs that sounded like Whitney's,just the clean approach alone. Brandy your voice is getting stronger and better each year. You got it.
I am so in love with Brandy
Always will be my favorite singer!!
This was so clever! The song, fit, body gestures, tone, lighting, the confession, the beauty... Everything was on point
Brandyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!
I love me some Brandy ✊🏾✊🏾

Brandy is a The Vocal Bible!!!!
SPEECHLESS
Often imitated, NEVER duplicated! My girl kilt it!!🔥
The beginning of this sounded like autotune song. Was she really singing it?
The vocal clarity, the choice of notes/runs, the TONE….Chile😱😱😱Come thru Brandyyyyyyy🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
YOU BETTA SANGGGGG
Makes no sense! The buttery smoothness of her vocals, effortless changes, riffs, runs...omg!!!
Where does her team get it wrong? I mean half the stuff that's mainstream and commercial right now is garbage and can't come close to this here perfection.
1:35 -1:50 is insane 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Giiiiiiiiiiirl!  If you don't sing that song! I almost threw my phone.
This is even better than the original recording! 🔥🔥🔥
1:46 she's INSANE!!!! Brandy is mother, these vocals are a God giving gift FOR SURE!!!! and the way she casually finishes it with that run???? chief kiss, the cherry on top cmonnnnn
Nah she bodied it! Expected no less tbf 👏🏾🔥
im now a fan that loves this song!
The TONE, THE RESTRAINT, THE CONTROL  She is the VOCAL BIBLE for a reason!!
If anyone has to do a versus challenge with her we would have to wake ms Whitney Huston 💐😭
What I always loved about her performances is her creativity on the ad libs. Its never just like the recorded track. Such a rare gem she is.  I'm a day 1 fan here who knows every song, every album, every riff, every beat drop, bass line, you name it, I know it.
Go girl!!!! Ahhh❤️
From beginning to end just 🔥🔥🔥. I hope I can see Brandy live, one day!
It took me watching her on Verzus to notice and appreciate that light energy she has when she sings and performs
1:40 - 1:50 got me in a chokehold 🔥
Brandy has done it again! This is another awesome performance. She just gets better with time.
This is absolute talent. So smooth omg. Real R&B🔥💯🥹
Sheeeh 🔥 this is my favorite song on the album so what a treat to experience this. thank you Brandy.
🔥🔥🔥🥰
Look at her ..looking as good as she wanna look🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰in my MARTIN voice

Vocals - flawless, outfit - flawless, her beauty- flawless, I can throw the “F word” all day long, flawless flawless and more flawless. Brandy is an absolutely, undisputed, Queen, her Majesty has done it again. I have watched this in amazement over and over again, I already got her B7 album, best album in my playlist since 2020, in constant rotation, but this live performance left me speechless and in awe. I know Patti Labelle was throwing shoes when she saw this. And I was left feeling proud of our beautiful black queen, Brandy has so many other accomplishments, so it shouldn’t surprise me as she just continues to slay, but this right here…wow, just wow!
Beautiful, Brandy😀👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️👏❤️❤️👏❤️❤️❤️👏❤️❤️💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓🥰🥰🥰♥️♥️💕💕💕💕💕💕💕❤️❤️🥰💋🙋🏻‍♀️

How come Brandy got the same face for the last 43 years?
Why I love Brandy: Brandy’s singing skill level is IMPECCABLE!!!!! She can go from baritone to second soprano on one record! She BUILDS her songs….she sings the first verse soft and silky, the second verse with more passion and a sprinkle of aggression with her ad libs over the second chorus, and on the bridge and vamp she goes BALLISTIC with so much vocal control!!!!! She knows how to use her instrument and not abuse it!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Brandy!!! Yes ma’am!! 😍💜 This was awesome!!
No extras, Ms. Brandy you just gave You to We.. We feel it baby… #TheVocalBible

Sounding & looking EPIC!🔥🌹
Love me some brandy especially when she harmonizing with herself just takes me to a place
Brandy's voice is Amazing, Soft, Soothing, Sultry and Angelic.
Brandy’s voice is out of this world. Her tone so rich and unique. Her voice will forever give me chills. I’m so glad I grew up listening to REAL artists like herself.
I’m pretty sure she used the vocals from the CD on the bridge
I swear this woman paints pictures with her voice.
this is better than the whole verzuz battle
Vocal Artiste!
Brandy is a voice that can never be duplicated. You vocals melt your soul and whoever is responsible for music that perfectly matches her voice. There will never be a comparison. She is effortless not forced. She can just sing without all the grunting, screaming all extras yall know what I'm talking about. I cant I just love her she's so smooth.
🔥🔥🔥
🙌🏽🔥
Sannnngggggg girl you better sing
THE 🐐🐐🐐
What a woman. 😍🔥
Well this was 🔥.
love you brandy ! forever !
I hate that Colors is now bringing these mainstream/media forced celebrities onto the platform. I came here on this channel at its inception because I thought it was to showcase non-USA artists, up and comers, and underground artists. I don’t care about migos, Brandy, or Neo! They already have other huge platforms and now they’re invading this space too???
Ommmmmgggggggh 🥰🥰🥰
The goat! 🐐
That "Yeah"  @ 1:43 my Lord 😢😢😢
A living Legend 🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love listening to every second of this song and all of Brandy’s  emotion🙌🙌🙌🔥

This is what happens when you perfect your craft.
You get better and better ! You better sang! I am throwing shoes!!
I love this version of the song! 💗💗💗
❤️
🔥🔥🔥
❤️❤️
This is the best vocal in 2022 from any R&B soul artist so far! This woman’s talent, ear and tone is unmatched! You are an inspiration! Love you!
The way she sings "attention" in verse 1... and "I don't need your... extra!" In chorus one 😭😭😭😭😭 Let's not even get to the choices she makes from verse 2 onwards! Jamani! The true fans know full well, how many greats STUDY our good sis. They know. Brandy always marches to the beat of her own drum vocally. The beauty of it all is her voice will give summer, spring, autumn and winter plus every season in between depending on her mood, tone, choices, melody, song theme, genre and life situation she's in. Her voice changes with every stage of her life, yet the quintessential Brandy TONE remains. Okay back to listening for the 10th time.
Naw she started out the gate at :27 with that damn baritone whisper . I can’t stop watching this spell she put me in 😵‍💫
Absolutely  Phenomenal.
The fact that I still get giddy whenever a new song or performance drops from this woman. Her voice never fails to stun!!! THE VOCAL BIBLE, she is!
Love this

😂 I done ran this back so many times!
The scream at 2:08 makes me faint every time.  Its the little touches like that that get me every time she perform 😭😭❤️

You are still my best, Brandy..... ❤️♥️ ♥️ ♥️
This is amazing, but I feel like it’s lip synced. The constant moving away from the mic with no volume variation is a tell. Vocals are fabulous regardless, although not live
Brandy different!!!!! This voice. Legend.
Brandy I love you so much you make my life so much more liveable
Brandy I love you so much you make my life so much more liveable

Don't do this COLORS, I look to you for global up and coming, this, this is regression, Brandy had her time she can shine anywhere but hungry young artists are suffering right now for opportunities the Brandy is eating more than she needs off. I'm here for up and comers man, not a fan of this at all, but hey thats me
Ugh one of my favorites!😭💗💗
Brandy is truly in a league of her own! The real ones know! Come on VocalBible 🤩🤩🤩🤩
I needed this ❤️ love it!!!

A BEAST.
Been playing this all morning!!! Just sending chills through me!
The voice that lives forever.......
My wife !!!!!!!
She's SO mother😭
👍👏👏👏👏👏👏
This song is so good throughout 2:48  almost slipped past me. Such smooth quiet agility. Her voice is so warm and comfortable.  Damn I really miss the era of music she was popularized in. When really good studio songs often represented the floor of an artist's musical talent, not the ceiling.
Brandy never disappoints vocally🔥 loving the outfit too ❤️
This my favorite song!!!! We need a videooo
Love this woman so much !!!
Here before the bet ppl come!  She been hardd🔥🥴
wow. wow. wow. wow. shocked. jaw on the floor. I swear Brandy never fails to disappoint!!!

Everything is so intricate and intentional. Whew girl, you are such a blessing 🙌🏾
Babyyyyyyyyyy yessssssssss!!!!!!!
LOW REGISTER RUNS. THAT'S THE POST.
I keep replaying and I have a new favorite part every single time. A legend.
That’s my girl!
Her TONE !!!!
🤌🔥🚀🍷❤️💯🫂
Is the microphone photoshopped? 🧐
Sis 🙌🏽 why you do this to me 😩❤🙌🌼 . Come on
A INSTRUMENT ‼️ Love me some Brandy✨🥂
People don’t understand how raw she is ! She is so silky,velvet,smooth with her tone. Her voice is like rain drops. So much comfort in her voice. GOAT for Tone , texture and range🅿️
I've followed Colors for about two years or so and this is such a compliment! I've always loved the authentication of their channel & the introduction to new or current artists. I must say to have mainstream artists join colors. Is a compliment to COLORS! Not the other way around!   I love you Colors!  I love Brandy!  I love music! ❤️
Whoa! This Beautiful Black Rose! Continues to blossom. Her petals represent love, genuine, classy, integrity, strength, courage and resilient and so much more. I love Brandy vocals. Her sound is like no other.
THEE VOCAL BIBLE!

Brandy you are just such a blessing !!!!! 💙
Fine Brandy I’ll listen to the song again! Lol
Brandy is truly a master of performance 😍 Her voice gets more amazing with time and I admire how she uses her instrument‼️
I’ve been praying for a LIVE ALBUM since the Full Moon era!!! We need B!!!!
Holy shish she's still incredible and still looks 20 somehow
❤️
I love Brandy, but she is over performing this. Lotta drama. Lol
Unpopular opinion: It's nice to see Brandy back....... but I *really* think they need to keep Colors as a platform for people who need exposure and. Brandy and Ne-Yo have 5 million YouTube followers behind them, so they don't need promotion. I want to see the hunger of people who haven't won a Grammy already. The newness is the main reason I watch this!
The vocal bible serving. ❤️
This was just so wonderious to the cosmic dimensions🥹🌺🥹🌺🌹✨🌹BRANDY GRABS YOUR HEART EVERY DAMN SWITCH UP💯❤️💯❤️💯
Brandy, you ARE music! Your ability to flip, tumble and land vocally ever so effortlessly is a marvel   Wishing you many more successes with Motown and sending you so much love from South Africa ❤
This song HAS always been a bop!!!! Thank you for the extrasssssss!!!!

Yes Brandy great song. Rather Be is a very great song. I like it listening on Sat. 6-25-2022.
I’m not gonna cap, I purely just melted. Somebody please come help me up. 🤤🥴
Will always love Brandy! Her vocals are so transcendent and have a way of transporting my entire psyche to a beautiful place.  I'll never forget listening to her music when I was in college and extremely depressed, it's like I could feel her soul telling me not to give up when she sings.  Her music is so relatable and a really wonderful gift 😊.  Thank you so much Brandy for all you do, love you! 🥰🤩❤️
Rather Be is such an amazing record!
Absolutely incredible! Her ear and tone are unmatched! ✨🎼
Brandy is a real artist! Her craft is her life! You can tell she has taken great care of her voice over the years! Watching this alone makes me want to go harder at everything I do. SN: Rather Be is definitely one of my faves from B7! I play it on repeat just so I can practice the ad libs lol.

brandy is one of the few artists where you know she’s gonna kill a performance before even listening to it. i knew last night it was gonna be amazing. not many artists sing really good every single time. she’s a legend and the vocal bible, never disappoints.
As usual, flawless in every way. That energy is beautiful. That trouser suit looks soooo good on B 😍
She is thee BEST
BRANDYYYYYYYYYYYY
4ever love Brandy🤎
Her voice and her smile 😍✨🔥
OMG MOMMMM

Love Brandy, love this song, but the vocals are way too over-produced here. If I wanted to hear a studio recording, I’d listen to the album.
Lawdddd this is sooooo good!!!! Brandy Rayana Norwood—— Soooo release this as an official single. This is amazing!!!

Real rnb real voice
She’s super talented Brandy is so LEGENDARY
We give brandy her praise and love for the tone, texture and poise in her singing but we never talk about her CHOICES!!!, Dynamics and cadences she adds to her inbetween vocal moments! Vocal mastery at its finest right here. This was a treat. 💫💫
Outstanding voice
We really  miss u Queen
Warning this would give u Chills 🤭🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
What’s makes her such and ELITE vocalist in my opinion is how tasteful she is within her musicality. Its never forced or overdone. It’s always the smallest/quickest things she does with her voice that’s grabs and hold my attention . @ 1:56 that “Your Extra”  just did it for me 😩 I DONT CARE  IF SHE’S NOT  YOUR VOCAL BIBLE, BUT SHES DEFINITELY MINE 🤎 Whew .
So smooth
Been a fan since the beginning! I love me some Brandy❤️
YES YES YES YES YES YES !!!!!!!!!! Waited for this once !!!!! The beast
