Why did the Cowboys lose?
What do you want. I am sorry mom.
Just remember, the star isnt a mascot, or a symbol. its a rating.
Who’s here after another failed year for the Cowgirls? Go Birds! 🦅
I'm A lifelong Cowboys fan. Being a Cowboys fan is !one being in an abusive relationship. They are so good at first and then bam, turn into a different team. They promise and say they are going to be better and we believe them and then they crush our hopes again.  That's why I now have alternative favorite teams. Namely the Chiefs, they don't disappoint
Some things NEVER change 😅
Still less playoff wins with dak and romo.. than Eli in two Super Bowl runs
Can’t wait for the new video 😁
As a Packer fan, I can’t wait to see next year‘s reel.
Looking for the next video😂
Scooter accidentally yelled at his Mom 💀
ongg being nervous asl and u ain’t even playing 😭😭
I miss Cooper!!!
" Im sorry mom"😂
“Nobody contact me for 24 hours!  Oh I’m sorry Mom”. Thats funny 😂
Are we sure this video isn't from last night? Lol
This fits even more after yesterday.
I first thought this was from last night, ngl
randy gregory is on 49ers now
So funny how Dak did not know the rule to give the ball to the umpire. The Cowboys always choke in the big games. It’s what they do.
Rayne Dakota Prescott aka Mr.Clocked Ball
Eagles fans today lol 0:14 😅
What a difference 1 year did NOT make.
How about them eagles
5:10 "Eagles are garbage too" That one didn't age quite so well
Lmao
Why does this feel like the 22/23 season?
I was like halfway through this video before realizing that this was the reaction video for last year's game.  Time is a flat circle.
I think of Scooter as a friend. Glad he is part of my life!!
Scooter how does it feel to lose to the Niners not once but twice
oh, this video was made LaSt yEaR.  😂
Watching this right after the 49ers beat the cowboys again in 2023
Oops clicked on the wrong playoff ass kicking from the niners.... can get confusing
so is part 2 out yet?
I came back to watch this again after last night's game and the slew of videos that came out today. Still entertaining.    Go Niners!
Time to make part 2!
Cant wait for this years version
Need the part 2
Scooter... you good?
History repeats itself
49ers got you guys again huh
Watching this again in 2023! Love your vids, Scoots
This certainly didn’t age well… 😂
How we feelin
And here we go again...  HOW 'BOUT THEM COWBOYS?
The Cowboys have had 12 straight playoffs appearances without reaching the nfc title game, the longest streak of that kind in nfl history.    Fucking remember that next year when you start with your fucking hot takes again
…………. and again.
I still remember you saying "15-2" lol jack ass 🤣
Here again.
I clicked on this thinking it was the 2023 Playoffs.
Overall it was a great year...hopefully the team improves for next year.
Cowgirl fans loooooove going freak nasty for the 9er inch deep choke.
Omg… I’m dying here.  Eagles fan falling down laughing.  You could replay this for this year’s playoff!  Sorry Scooter but not sorry.😂
Deja Vu
Where are you scooter
Waiting impatiently for this year's elimination video... Signed Proud Eagles Fan 😂😂
1 year later  lost again 😂😂
Just re-upload this video
I'm going back to Mexico no more cowgirls for me
What year is this?! 😂😂😂
Well….another season ends in a very familiar way.
Wow you got this video out FAST   Oh,sorry. This was last year
Who else is back here after they lost to the Niners again?
Sooooo great
*1 year ago* 49ers 23 - Cowboys 17 Cowboys - we ran out of time *2023 playoffs later* 49ers 19 - Cowboys 12 Cowboys - 🥺🥺🥺🤧🤧🤧🤧 I dont know 49ers - Lame excuses cowgirls sit down and shut it while we take our gold opportunity in the Conference Championship Round 🤭😏
They got beat with a rookie 🤣 you stupid Dallas fan 😂
The good news is that you can just re-upload this video as your recap from 2023!
the cowboys all they do is choke in the playoffs
missed the hold on parsons??? no they missed him throwing a punch
youre not gonna want to meet the 49ers defense nor the offense in the upcoming game
Commenting because we all know this will happen again!
Ready for the repeat 😂😂😂
NEXT WEEK: If DALLAS COWBOYS vs SAN FRANCISCO 49ers!!!  I want to hear DEION SANDERS pick for the  DIVISION GAME.  You can’t say I’m NEUTRAL because Cowboys Nation & 49 ers Nation are TWO SEPARATE.  It’s like saying you neutral if Colorado Buffaloes vs Jackson State. *You better PRAY the Buccaneers WIN 🏆 🙏⚖️🤲🏽
Technically didn't the clock not even count?
I mean cowboy fans do this to themselves the amount of talk they do every single year that’s leads to squat.
Joey Wheeler = Dallas Cowboys
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Scooter: What do you want?!! Scooter: I'm sorry Mom.
As a 49er fan that's been once since I was very young.. that was very happy that the 49ers didn't win the game but it's so much better for beating a old rival... But I was really nervous at the very end.. but maybe this will start a brand new rival with the cowboys.. now I grew up in the 90s and I will always say that the '90s will be the last great decade and one of the reasons was because football.. and I remember how Dallas cowboys ran over the San Francisco 49ers twice in the NFC championship and just ripped my heart out as a 49er fan and I truly hated the cowboys very much even though I had a respect them and the 49ers finally got back at them at the 94 NFL championship... During that particular time especially in the early 90s that's was football at its best for that generation... People like rest in peace John Madden said that whoever wins the NFC championship when the super bowl and that was the main event.... But I would love to see a rival renewed between the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas cowboys... But every time I hear about the Dallas cowboys especially watch the NFL Fox post game where Jimmy Johnson who was the head coach for those Dallas cowboys who won the super bowl 3 out of 4 years left the Dallas cowboys and it was due that the fact that Jerry Jones didn't get along with Jimmy Johnson.. it was said that Jerry Jones wanted some credits and please don't get me wrong Jerry Jones is it a good owner he's probably better than most owners but I think that was his biggest mistake and I would have to say that if Jimmy Johnson what it stays with the Dallas cowboys that they would have won two more super bowls... I think Jimmy Johnson is one of the best coaches and just to think that at that particular time that Eddie tomorrow was thinking of hiring Jimmie Johnson who was coaching in college with the Miami hurricanes... If Jimmy Johnson would have been the head coach for the San Francisco 49ers we would also have two more super bowl rings
Wow that almost made me feel bad for Cowboys fans... almost
Stephen A. Smith warned you
quit whining im a giants fan. we’ve got it much harder
As a Patriots fan, after witnessing that horrible Wild Card game, Cowboys fans tears are quite comforting.
49ers suck and ref number 55 needs to be fired for attacking a player
This will start off my Football Season
It's what I tell my Packer fan friends, if you want a guaranteed win in the playoffs, just make sure you're playing the Bears in every playoff game. If you can manage that, it's a lead-pipe cinch your team will be victorious.
I reacted the same way at end of the game lol
Are you supposed to be funny! Because you're not! You would have been at my place , I would have told you to leave! Make me sick 😝!!! GO NINERS 😡!!!
Jimmy G beat the Cowboys lol
WHAT DO YOU WANT???! Oh, I'm sorry, Mom... LMAO
They stink
When you realize the Falcons have more playoff wins since 2000 than the Cowboys do 😂
June 4 2022.... was watching Finals video and suck F it let me for 1st time since game want to think or REMEMBER what happened..... Made it 140 in and decided I'm still not ready #Subway
☠☠☠☠
4:41
I was scared the entire 4th quarter
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The only Deebo I'm scared of is in a Chris Tucker movie 😂😂
6:00.......BRUHHH I'm dying LMAO
I almost died after crying so much after the game
It's even funnier the second time
it really seemed like the media and the cowboy fans believe that they were going to win and go all the way to the super bowl due to the fact that it had a good season and there were division champions.... but maybe if you forgot that they had a really easy schedule and they played in the AFC East that people said that it's the worst division they ever saw so winning it doesn't say anything... wow the San Francisco 49ers who are my favorite team who had a pretty tough schedule who had to fight hard to get a spot in the NFC postseason.. and they play in the NFC West division which is considered the toughest division in football and three teams from that division went to the playoffs... now San Francisco 49ers were in third place in their division and made it all the way to the NFC championship and they were so close of winning it....
This Eagles fan may have watched my team get beat by the GOAT however we didn't end our season on a clocked spiked. As Stephen A Smith says what can go wrong will go wrong they are a accident Waiting to happen 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
lol awww, you spent a lot of time on this didn't you?
Yall are pure garbage. The EAGLES WILL WIN THE EAST IN 2022! Cowboys Stink!
we didn't lose on a spiked ball we lost b/c our multi-million dollar QB decided to run straight up the field with 14 seconds left and NO time outs. one of the biggest bone-headed decisions in the history of the NFL. you NEVER run the ball with no time outs. that's football 101.
God bless you
youtube didn't recommend this to me.
As a former Raiders fan (I gave up when Markie Davis screwed over the Oakland fans and then Gruden got rid of every star BUT the racist QB…I guess now we know why), I moved to South Carolina and have been trying to adopt a new team.  But I can't really feel the Panthers, I'm not going to root for a team that plays in a dome (what's your excuse, Falcons?  Don't tell me "humidity", you can make it through September, FFS! And Atlanta isn't Miami…you're a half-mile up!), and Jacksonville is a complete joke.  And yet…they've all had more playoff success in the last 10 years than Dallas has had in the past 25.  Ouch, "boys.  Ouch.
Haven't seen you in awhile man congrats on the weight loss. If it wasn't for your voice I wouldn't know it was you
Packers fan ls were right about Mike Mccarthy this man's garbage
well too bad dallas cowboys
Since 1996, the Cowgirls have a 4 playoff victories The Giants have 10 And they stopped trying to make the playoffs years ago!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 I get so mad when the cowboys lose I’ve been a fan since we had Troy Aikman
I can never get tired of watching this
You have to be one of the GREATEST story tellers EVER! Bless your heart… I knew the end, but still had hope! Smh…Seriously it was like watching and hoping Charlie Brown would pick a better tree… Same thing over and over. 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣🤣🤣 I’m a Washington fan, but From my divided house to yours… maybe next year. ❤️🙏🏾😊
Pure genius mang
I’m sorry mom
Hate to see the cowboys lose but these videos make me feel better
If Jerry Jones really wants to win then why tf is McCarthy still there
You need to do Bucs and Rams…I have watched this 6 times already.
I'm gonna cry
sorry scoot but it must be done  HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS
As a Cowboys fan I was just able to bring myself to watch this. This one hurt.
The Bengals can make it to the superbowl and y'all cant 🤣 How about them cowboys, America's Mediocre Team for the past 26 years.
😂😂
And through it all, Moonlight Sonata plays in the background.  Classic!!!!
Refs vs boys
2:22 that how I felt when we were losing i talked way to much crap before the game
Sorry about the loss but it is still a funny video.  "Did we just lose the game on a clocked ball?!!"
Cowgirls are garbage!!!..🦨🦧🐷🐒...one and done!!!... already talking about SB n 23, talk the 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️!!!
Let’s go Ninerssssssssss
Because their plane can take them anywhere but to the playoffs
I started crying, but then I remembered we do this every year. I got over in 3.8 seconds. Anybody wanna go get some hot wings? Im out.
“Greg Zuerlien makin extra points? It’s a wrap” So Accurate that’s how I react too 😭
We are a one and done team I remember when the Cowboys were good in the 70s and early 90s but the Jimmy Johnson curses on us and the way Jerry got rid of Tom Landry is coming back to haunt us I’m no longer gonna be a Cowboys fan I can’t take the disappointment anymore
"Why couldn't we play like this earlier?!"
Mike McCarthy- let's run qb draw with 14 seconds with the season on the line and lose Kellen Moore- coach wanna do that- Dak Prescott ok coach- ref let's stop them from winning as a cowboys fan I hate this.
This is hilarious
i did my studies & analyzed. if you take away all our penalties or at least 90% of them we win this game 31-17
LOL!!!!
Second half of the vid is Scooter's rollercoaster of rage.
I was hoping to see a Tampa Bay fan reaction
49ers lost, haha! they got what they deserved!
4:42 MY FAVORITE PART!!!!
“This is just gettin absurd. Did we run the hook and lateral”. 🐐 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Here's the simple answer: 100 UNCALLED PENALTY YARDS AGAINST San Francisco in the 1st Half ALONE! THAT'S AN ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE FIELD, essentially giving a TD! How many points did the Cowboys lose by? Oh yeah, a TOUCHDOWN! There's your answer! Cowboys have had more penalties called against them than ANY of their opponents over the last 15+ years! And it's the most in the league by a long shot! Goddell has had it out for Jones since he got in and it shows!
Were you really that surprised. Lmfao
That 24hr cool off is real!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
*HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS*
as a Niner fan, this brings me great joy.
😞🙏
As a Washington fan....if we can't be happy. The Cowboys can't either!
I love how the Eagles fan calls to talk trash, despite losing earlier in the day. That's exactly how we felt in Philly.
Playing 'Moonlight Sonata' in the background makes this even funnier.
Heard Moonlight Sonata and tragedy abounds.
Thought u u said they were winning the super bowl scooter!!!!
cowboys lost cuz eagles better
Scooter it's hook and LATERAL..
Lol Manz is frustrated. You bout to go back to background dancing for educational video cuz Dallas aint worth it lol
The refs, dumb penalties, dumb ideas, and also the clock information in the end
Thank you Cowboys, for making this an easier ending to the season, for an Eagles fan.
Book of Scooter : 5:20 😔
The louder he gets the more sounds like Tom hanks
They wouldn’t show the slime because the cowboys were being petty.
can't wait for clickbait tomorrow! Us Grossi Possi deserve what's coming!
Trumps fault
As long as the cowboys stay with Dak....cowboys will never make a superbowl appearance let alone win one......NO WAY
an infinite loop of "its over" then "WERE BACK IN THIS BABY"
they gave us too much hope at the end
Lmao 🤣 🤣 🤣 why was this my wife
5:48 be like…Pain 💀💀💀
Sean Payton is available. Any thoughts for a new head coach?
Your aging in that thumbnail man .. must suck being a Cowboys fan. 🙄🤦‍♂️😆
"Why do I give them so much time of my life?" -Ooof that one hit a little to real for me :'(
This video was fucking hilarious, really well done man  👍
Glad I'm not the only one that gets too emotionally invested in football games 😅 I always try to prepare myself everytime Jimmy G throws the ball and pray it's not an interception or a shitty incomplete pass
As a bears fan, do you wanna talk about this?
NOBODY CONTACT HIM FOR 24 HOURS!
Bruh...Cards Fan: They don't have Jalen and we're still losing?!?!?!
How many Cowboys fans does it take to screw in a light bulb? None, they just stare at the dead bulb and reminisce on how great it used to be.
This is the most accurate video I’ve ever seen
Stephen A’s brother!
Cowboys took over the Pete Carroll legacy of why did you throw the ball! Now McCarthy holds the legacy of why did you freaking run the ball Dak?
“We can’t lose, I’ve talked too much trash for this” how is this different than any other Cowboys game?
Why is there a picture of a San Francisco Cable car on his wall?
i was a fan when you didnt have hair
How overpaid is Dan Prescott on a scale of 1 to 10 in your opinion?
14 flags, that's double any other team through the playoffs. FOURTEEN!
🤣🤣🤣‼️Hilarious ‼️❤
You are hella funny. Watched it several times
From a 49er fan good game cowboys
Out Dueled by JIMMY G
I can believe myself finish watching this. Lol
So darn funny! 😅.
It could be worse, I’m a carolina fan.
Cowgirls, you mean.
"Is this how Eagles fans felt earlier cause this is ridiculous" na y'all self imploded nobody expected anything from the Eagles😂
I still can’t believe we lost 😞
I’ve been waiting for this video.  And I am not disappointed.  Lol
I smoked after this game. And my buddy was watching the replay next to. It literally made me sick and throw up. I’ve never thrown up from emotions
The last words of the cowboys “ penalties will be the death of us”
I’m waiting for a “FIRE MIKE MACARTHY”
Another year of the Cowboys being an embarrassment to the league 😂
Well done!
Overrated!!!🥱😆🦅🦅🦅
This was me - minus about 600 curse words
You can literally remove the time stamps on all these post season cowboys videos and you couldnt tell any season apart from another.
Hahaha my 49ers just booted you guys and packers too hahahhaha
Dak and Zeke suck man. As a long loved fan dak just ain't the guy to bring you there
Hahaha the deebo comment got me 😂
49ersbigfan here" this is the funniest scooter ever being..
More annoying when it's staged.
Be happy you didn't blow you're one and only chance, in the next decade at least, to tear through the playoffs and get slaughtered in Super Bowl 50 and have nother 6 years of rebuilding
Pollard is the best running back on the cowboys. Wasting money on zeke
5:17 -- My favorite switch.
Calm down. No wonder you’re watching the game alone.
This was great!! 😂😂😂😂😂 #Dontcallmefor24hours #Ninerfaithful
He should commentate for real! He is great!!
Not from Dallas bandwagon lol
Just delete your channel.. this is the clown who thinks ceedee can make plays like Deebo 😂😂😂
The cowboys lost because DAK THREW THE GAME
Best video he caption the passion fans act at that game. Why do Dak waits to last quarter to wake up
America’s team indeed. Love it.
49ers let’s goooo
THATS SO NOT RAVEN!!!!
Hoo boy, can't wait till he does the Chiefs and Bills
Can you do 49ers vs Packers? This is fire 🔥 😂
Remember when he was called Greg the Leg 😂😂😂
Damn Scooter look hecka funny with hair
The Eagles may be garbage, but at least we don't pretend that they aren't. At least I don't.
Very entertains... 49er fan.  I recall the knife in my heart ❤️ when the Boys knocked the Niners outa the playoffs three years in a row.  Early 1970s.
So cowboys/refs in therapy next week?
Brings me such great joy
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS AND YOUR EDITING SKILLS...YOU ARE DA MAN BRO....SORRY BOUT YOUR LOSS...BUT THERES ALWAYS NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER THAT OR THE YEAR AFTER THAT OR THE YEAR AFTER THAT...OR THE YEAR AFTER THAT EVEN...IN OTHER WORDS ONE DAY IN THE NEXT MILLINNIUM MAYBE....LOL
Finally getting to watch this 😒. Niners deserved that win tbh
🎻😆
"I hope he feels better..... after this game"  That was being a bit generous I'm not gonna lie
He was right we're gonna lose cause of penalties 😆
Now do one with the Bills and chiefs 😂
During most games
Hahahahaha cowboys lost.  Cry to the refs like usual
Bucs v rams reaction video?
Oh, the "Moonlight" Sonata in the background under all that excitement, prefacing the sadness to come... BRILLIANT...
Cowgirls can go 17-0 and still be 1 and done 🤣🤣🤣
"who kicks a FG down 2 TD's in the 4th?"   Hey man, Kliff Kingsbury did it down 3 TD's in the 4th.
I may never get tired of watching this video.
LMAO...this is me at some point every single year as a Chiefs fan.
Hella funny
What the HECK are we doing
I couldn't even watch this today until the Bucs lost. Life Cowboys fan. *sigh* I don't want to talk about it!
This was 5 minutes too long.
I called that Sh*t…this is the year of the underdog
Came back here looking for Packer fan who had written in the comment section after thought that mess about Cowboys
This how I felt
The cowboys are like Al Bundy, 4 touchdowns in one game in '96 ,
May your misery continue. Sucks to suck.
Niners on top
Damn this shit was annoying af
Jones should start drinking again.
Problem is Jerry gave crippling contracts to a mediocre RB and QB and every Dallas fan is delusional enough to believe Zeke and Dak are top tier.
That was pretty accurate.
Cowboys suck they verse trash teams to make it to the playoffs
Awww, every grandparent is mad that their 90s dynasty team lost, boo hoo
Also, I don't care about people talking trash about the eagles as a defense for another team... Reason being? They won a fricken superbowl against the Patriots when BRADY was in; to me, they'll always be winners.   (but fr tho, the bird teams just fumbled at the end. Pretty sucky, ngl.)
cowboys won all the other games cuz the west division is low tier in general. Now how they lost this game BEATS ME cuz they were givin so many chances; ain't nobody's fault that they forgot to give the ball to the ref. (Like everyone should already know).  But the 49r's are just a good team in general; if you saw yesterday's game on the packers... the 9r's are EASILY way better than the cowboys for how they won despite all the rough conditions.  Cowboy fans should see other games other than JUST cowboy games; look at the game, not the team.  If you watch for the team, then you don't watch football. Hell, you don't know football.
Ha ha
I'm a 9ER bit this was hilarious 🤣
Just be glad your coach didn't call a timeout when the opposition was okay with a tie to get in
Could be worse.  Could be a Falcons fan! 😔
Your videos used to be hilarious back in the old jets videos days..now all of your content is too self-aware.
Hey at least I can say my Panthers won as many playoff games as the cowboys this year 😂
I wish there was a Green Bay dude like this guy. I figure that video would be pretty entertaining.🤔
Hey. It's me. Just enjoying your suffering.
I'm a Washington fan and I think you're great. Funny content brother.
Is there anyway we can our money back from Dak 😂? We gonna need it to pay for more talent cause this ain’t working lol
This is actually very entertaining 🤣
I felt that stare at the end.
ANNOYING BULLSHIT....... LLLLLLOOOSSDERRRRRR...
And now the Niners beat Green bay! You can’t even say at least they lost to the Packers!!! Love your video though. Thought it was gonna be another excuse video on why they lost. It was actually very entertaining
There is no safe minimum volume to watch this video.
ROFLMFAO!!! That was great stuff 👏
Didn't Cowboys lose a playoff game similar to this in the Tony Romo era?
We share pain! As a Vikings fan, I don't think I will ever see them win a super bowl, let alone be in one. All I gotta say is at least the cowboys have some trophies.
Enjoy the videos Scooter.  Not a Cowboys fan, but we can agree that Philly (in all incarnations) are bottom-feeding ne'er-do-wells so there's at least that.
"What do you want?!" "Sorry, Mom" 😂🤣😂🤣
49ers!
your first mistake was being a Cowboys fan.
You gonna react to Packers doing their best impression of Cowboys?
I am incapable of feeling sorry for a Cowboys fan.
Pretty good bro. Excellent editing. Spot on comments/reactions/facial/etc. Funny. I hope you have an honest manager when you hit the big time.
Now do Packers fans during the 49ers game
I love his crying!!!!!! WHINE Cowboys WHINE!!!
Dude, that was epic.
Want see a Packers fan thing now. good video
30 years under Jerry.  They soft!  Jerry gets to take his yacht around the world during the summer as Cowboy fans make him rich but he has less wins in the playoffs the last 25 years than the Jaguars.
Whole nfl games are fixed man. Fuck Them
Re watching this hurts so much
At least now you guys can talk about your loss with packers fans now
Should do a video for Packers fans this week…
Once again the refugees screwed my Dallas Cowboys! 🤬🤬🤬
LOL, oh my God that was so funny 😂😂😂😂
💚🦅💚Love my EAGLES…😂You had me dying!! 😂
Well they weren't the only team to get diped by the 9ers.
Bang Bang Niners Gang
Where was Pam oliver?
Who’s here after the 49ers won against the packers
And now niners going to win every thing
It’s that time of the year again  Say the line again Bart  We Dem Boyz 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Cowgirls lose and it’s a great day
You going do the rest of the teams and game since you guys lost??
The tears of pain from cowgirls sustains me at this point
How bout them niners americas team
Dude I was the same way! I tell ya I can't stand Romo.. he jinxed the game with his foresight BS
This is Exactly what I think of when I see Skip Bayless tweeting about his Cowboys during the game 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
DUDE I SEE EXACTLY WHAT STEVEN A  IS TALKING ABOUT  U HAD 4 QUARTERS TO BEAT THE 49ERS  STOP CM OMPLAINNING  YOU LOST  SHUT UP AND WAIT FOR NEXT YEAR
LMAO.. Thanks. ;)
Mariah Carey "One Sweet Day" was the top song the last time the Cowboys made it past the divisional round of the playoffs. Google and Facebook didn't exist. Windows 95 was the hot new OS.
I feel your pain and frustration but we both know we'll be just as rabid next season.
Boy you funny. Good luck next year 😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂
Phenomenal team, garbage coaching staff.
Sheeesh
I waited 4 days fam, are you good?
Dak is an 1st class choke artist
Come on now I know you want to cry
What a great reenactment if there was an Oscar nominee for the best short subject on YouTube 4A frustrated disillusion Cowboys fan he has my vote.
Bang Bang Niner Gang!
Cowboys trash
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 he yelled @ his mom
Damn I’m surprised that his neighbors didn’t the police on that fool!
5:04 i feel this can be used for a meme not related to sports  like insert a disappointing anime here
So what player
Groot... I am Groot
Tom..Tomorrow...Tomorrow
✔ Bradley and Milton games
Rookie or ROOK!
It's between that or Mac Jones Facebook
#11 Micah Parsons
Let's Go Jerry!
Oh they have a confident kicker, must be nice😂😂😂😂
Gotta love this guy even though I hate cowboys
Well done man 😂
Story of my life
@ :11 sec SHOTS FIRED AT TROY AIKMAN. I see what you did mentioning the Eagles game then the Tony comment.
This video was….amazing
Because “dem boys” ran into real MEN 😂
Beethoven in the back is just 🤌🏼
Could I please hire you next season for my Broncos?  Believe me, you'll be needed as I know in advance your talents will be needed.  Awesome stuff man, literally funny as hell!
Haven’t seen one of your videos a minute. You’ve lost some weight! Congrats man 😎
Stop crying all of you at least your team didn’t give the lions there first win.
How bout them Cowboys... lol
Ofc he complains ab the refs 🤣
Eagles fan. Its remarkable that I don't HATE Dallas anymore. Seriously. I remember the 70's for instance. Then.. TWENTY more years of.. "Americas Team" 😠 They won and won and WON!🤬 Now?! I forget to think about them...😒
That captured frame at the beginning makes you look like Jussie SMOLLET.  Edit Me.
He's losing his mind
Didn't blame the refs. This is fake
I waited 4 days after the game to watch this I didn’t want to relive again but I did
This is 100% accurate
This game made my heart so full 🦅
why focus just on them losers. every team loses once in a while
Practically every sport fan. Lol.
Just checking to see if you STILL DEM BOYS 🤣🤣🤣
MCcarthy and the penalties took us out of this game. I can't believe this dude is gonna be our coach for the next ten years or until jerry passes.
Cowboys lose America wins
They got slime?? Scooter with da right questions
"The first bad throw by Cedric Wilson" completely true
49ers all day long buddy!!!!!! Just next don’t put so much energy into hoping they win when they play us. Lol
Not sure if this is a parody or a documentary of the average Cowboys fan.
"PENALTY WILL BE THE DEATH OF US" Says alot about the NFL in general
DAK WANTED $50 MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR LOL!!
not a dallas fan, but I feel you bro, I really do...
“Packers fans were right about McCarthy!” Now you see how frustrating it was for us watching him waste Rodgers’ talent all those years.
OMG I love watching dallas fans when cowboys lose 🤣
I can’t do edits like this.. Jeez
GET SET CEDEE, C'MON!! 🤣🤣🤣
the only reason bosa got hit by his own player cause the lineman held him all the way down to the ground and without him yall still loss bang bang niner gang
Yoooooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣 thank you!!
The second of straight chillin after they got a touchdown 😂😂😂
It hurts but thank you… and it’s still cowboys nation 😢
Hes ruight though, GB fired mccarthy for a reason, and that reason caused dallas to lose to SF
As an Eagles fan, I’m on my 10th watch of this. Never heard Scoot's voice go THAT hard on the words "clocked ball”. 😂😂😂
Every fan when an opposing player gets hurt: "Man I hope he feels better.... after this game"
I don’t know who edited this but I hope they are released from the institution soon.
I'd rather be a Jets fan than a captive of the Cowboys because at least I'd know they're lousy and disappointing in advance.
Except the Eagles were supposed to win 4 games all season and finish last in the division, instead they made the playoffs. The Cowboys were supposed to be legitimate contenders and they shit the bed as usual
Insert Stephen a smith laugh
How bout them cowboys
They ran the score up on the Eagles secondary to keep the momentum going. So as an Eagles fan this brought me the ultimate satisfaction!
As a 49ers fan, I appreciate you. lol
Cowboys lose because Jerry Jones can't stand the head coach getting the credit instead of him, So he fired Jimmy Johnson... and they haven't been to the Super Bowl since. Karma is a bitch.
Never heard anyone more annoying.....
This definitely needs to be the opening segment on clickbait sports 😂
I always love watching these when y’all lose
NFL is rigged  we are the dumbbutt that keep watching
😂😂😂😂😂⚰⚰⚰⚰
I'm nervous and I'm not even playing 🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣
fr tho how they only see hold on cowboys every game lol
this was pretty accurate lol
So annoying
Im a niners fan and I feel great
your pain is my enjoyment but bravo, sir. Bravo. Awesome work. btw....You can't spell elite without E-L-I!
“WHAT DO YOU WANT?” “I’m sorry mom”
I love when trash talkers get shut up 😂😂😂😂
Moma don't let your baby 🍼 grow up to be a cowboy 🤠🎵🎶🎼😂
One and done damn
I'm watching the video only for the ending... I had no clue what we were doing that game
Cowboys break my heart every year!  But next year…lol 🤣😢
Lol that's my mom telling me my Texans didn't even make the playoffs when I call her soon as the game is over
What? No Grossi Phone Call?
I have an idea on why the cowboys lost: because they're losers!
Your videos are hilarious!!!
You could see how terrified Dak was once the 49ers walked down the field and scored on the opening drive. He simply is not a QB that deserves $40 million dollars. The Cowboys will not win until he is gone.
Like 👍🏾 if you’re here cause you’re a 49ers fan
The last bit of silence, I agree with that. I don't see them getting a chance like this for a long while.
As a Eagles fan, I can proudly say I lived to see the Birds win a Super Bowl. Sorry Scoots. Love your content tho!!
Fast forward to week 1 of 2023 season: "We the greatest, we gone all the way, its our year!"
Hi
You sound like Tom Hanks when you yell!
Go for it!!!! Lmao
Dallas has a talented enough roster (and a delusional enough owner) for McCarthy to coast until retirement.
how about those cowboys!!!
This is literally incredible!
It must really suck to be a Cowboys Fan 🤣 Fucking Eagles won a Superbowl with Nick Foles... Oof, did I mention that...
You called the game well . This will be a classic dallas cowboy video. Funny as hell !
Ending should have been “alright, next season is our year”
Dallas got outplayed. They shouldn't have put themselves in the position for that ending
Lmao this shit funny I live I'm texas these cowboys fans crazy
4:40 and on is straight GOLD!!
The only downside to the cowboys losing IS we won't get this weekly gems. As a lions fan the cowboys are how I coupe with the NFL🤷🏾‍♂️ #GOLIONS
Don’t lie, next offseason all y’all cowboys fans will be screaming about how “this year different, this is our year!!! We DeM BoyZ”
If Dak gave the ball to the ref they might of had 1 more play. He should know that the ref has to set the ball not him or the center. How dumb can you be? I played football and even I know that
someone send this to stephen a
Their only problem is they can't play everyone in the NFC East every week,  How Bout Them Cowboys?
😂😂😂😂 I love his melt down!! Exactly how we ALL felt!!
“ I hope he feels better…after this game” tell me that’s lowkey not what everyone has thought at some point
Your problem Scooter is that you have no enthusiasm Lol
Green Bay packers for life, also Fort Worth is better than Dallas
Cowboys wasted there spot in the playoffs lol
“Next year is our year” cowboys fans every year
Different year… same cowboys 😂
Thank you.  I needed this!  Funny and very sad (the Cowboys' playing that it). You should have stuck to watching the game on Nick.  At least the graphics were fun and entertaining - unlike what was going on down on the field.
As a cowboys fan this is so accurate it’s scary
I was like - that was a whole MJB BET 2019 concert
I don't even like the cowboys, in fact i kinda dislike them. but i like these sketches so much i was hoping the cowboys would make it farther so we can have more of these......
At least you guys went to playoff, unless Seahawk who went home packing.
That's exactly how I was feeling with my Steelers
Cheer up at least you don't have the falcons
I'm a bears fan all my life. I feel ur pain brother
This guy is hilarious! 😂🤣😂🤣😭
Go 49erssssss
Cowboy fan to Cowboy fans in the final 5 minutes: “everyone calm down. Jerry took care of the refs. We got this. Have you been listening to Tony? He knows. We’ve got this.”  Cowboy fan to Cowboy fans the final 10 seconds: “how the hell is a team in the heart of Texas in the NFC East?”
Why do Cowboys fans still talk sh*t when this happens every season? Do they ever learn?
I love the bi-annual playoff loss by the Cowboys. You can bet on it almost like clockwork.  Dallas won’t win until Jerry gets a football mind/person running the team. So basically never again🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can anybody telL me when the Cowboys next game is?
Wha- what is that a baby on the field?
I forsee the Cowboys turning this man into George Jefferson with a top down hairline.   He gonna keep gradually losing hair every year the Cowboys fuck up before getting to an NFC Championship… Cowboys ain’t even done that in like 25+ years 💀
I just love cowboys in misery for 27 yrs
Perfection
Since Dallas last won a SB in 1995:  Panthers (established in 95): 9 playoff wins, 4 NFC title games, 2 SB losses Jaguars (established in 95): 7 playoff wins, 3 AFC title games  Texans (established in 02): 4 playoff wins  Cowboys = 4 playoff wins, last made it to NFC title game in 1995  The Raiders last won a playoff game 20 years ago....but they still have 4 playoff wins since 2000.   LOL Playoff appearances in the last 10 years  Bengals: 5 Lions: 3 Cowboys: 3

Guess yall weren't "Dak" good   🤣 🤣
LOL @ THE COWBOYS
Yo my Brother is a Cowboys fan and I am a Straight nines fan, been that way for 40 years. Even after the lost. He still stands tall for his cow girls. Respect. Same for all the years nines sucked too. Dont take it too hard bro
Wanna talk about it?
How about them Cowboys?!!!  Yall home with us (WFT) as always!!....LOLOL
I love watching the cow girls lose. It’s my favorite thing in the world.
Cowboy nation let’s start a boycott. Nobody buy any more merchandise until, a playoff game is won. Why spend money on an organization that isn’t paying us back for all the money we spend on them. It’s only fair. #boycotttheboys
This season and that game, is the reason pause the over hype train. They should at this point truly earn the hype. Know what I am say? Can cow girls nation dig that sucker? The cheer leaders need to start until, the back's get better. Lol, Jk
Funny stuff! It's like you had a window in my home watching me watch that trash-game. That. Was. Painful. When it was over, I shut off the TV and went to the beach with my family immediately to stop myself from doing something I might regret. It took me 3 days before I could watch the post game interviews.
Yeah, my Eagles are trash too but we weren't suppose to be good this year. We weren't in a "win now" season like the Cowboys lol. Time is running out for Dallas. You hate to see it lol
How does it feel, that the video with the most views you gain is watching your team lose! Hilarious! Love your work! All that talk!
Excellent
Just for the title it's self!! :)
That was above EXTRAORDINARY!
This Guy is so funny!!
Sounds like a Browns fan lol
😂😂😂😂 Nxgga editing skills is crazy had to take some time…👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Hey at least you don't have to look at your team getting the first pick in the draft again.
6:03  Not anymore.
DARK is no tom Brady!!!! Lol
Nialed it!!!!
Being a 49ers fan this was beautiful and so detailed!   P.s. I will delete this comment tomorrow before we face the packers just in case. I have faith! But it’s to the bay not so much the team in this game but I’m hoping
👍👍👍🤣🤣🤣
Brilliant
It’s like you had a video in my house.

100% accurate
To funny 💯🏈
I'm a Skins fan, this is HILARIOUS
Dear Cowboys fans,  I’m sorry. Much love to you.  -An Eagles fan
It's funny because its true...well done sir
This hurts to relive
At this point I’m a Cowboys fan because I’m a sadist.
We need to get rid of Dak. And while we're at it, Zeke too,  Both trash imo. Our D and receivers are legit.... Penalties hurt us big time in this game. Who tf are we, high school players????
Difference between the Eagles loss and the Cowboys loss is that at least the Eagles fans accepted their team was ass this year
Thank you for brightening my Day :)
This really sounds legit.. not a cowboy fan, but I imagine 85% of cowboy fans feeling like this.😄
You are damn fool for gettin ur hopes up thinking the boys are anything but a one and done team! No AIKMAN, SMITH or IRVIN means no playoff wins, ever again. I told all Dallas fans even if cowboys make the post season they will never see the second round again. Dallas has not been to the superbowl in almost 30 years man! As a GIANTS fan,  I'm happy, at least we have been to the big show in 2012, and won, boyyy!!!
As trash as my Eagles are, our season ended on the same day the Cowboys and their Super Bowl aspirations did
Nice funny video.  I can't wait to see the next year one.
As a die-hard 'Skins fan, I never thought I'd have so much understanding for a Cowboys fan. I feel ya Bro.
I felt all of this!
not gonna lie...i just skipped to the end to see the reaction to the dumb ass running play.
🤦🏽‍♂️
Man I’m a Niners fan and I was sooo happy we beat y’all. Y’all Cowboys fans talked so much shit on my Facebook page. Then went quiet when the game was over. Lmao. I loved it.
Who does a QB run with 12 seconds. Then try to get mad at the ref. McCarthy, baby! Hiring that guy is your biggest mistake. He allows so much sloppy football. That's why Dallas gets so many penalties now.
As a 49ers fan, I was waiting for this. :)  Jokes aside, I'm a huge fan of you, Scooter.
As a miserable Bears fan.... HAHAHAHAHAHA
LOL that's about every Cowboys fan - another disappointment - team to move on to another team who really wants that ring!
😂😂😂😂😂 That was Funny Shit. Well done.
Puff puff pass scooter.
Next year will be the Cowboys year I just know it! Lol!  What a disaster this team is!  Need to put an asterisk by those five touchdown passes Dak had against the Eagles! Never knew which Cowboys team was going to show up week-to-week, so inconsistent. Also the o-line was atrocious Dak was under pressure most of the day. And the penalties uncalled for just undisciplined! Who the hell runs the ball up the middle with time running out? Freaking ridiculous it's an embarrassment to the fans and to the organization!
CowGIRLS FAN SUCK IT EASY!!! Real talk. So F’n tired of y’all straight up! Haha
"Chris Tucker movie"!?  Bro it a Ice Cube movie...
Just your friendly neighborhood giant fan here just a reminder  you guys will be sitting with us this weekend
The guy gets more views when the Cowboys lose. 🤠
"What do you want??!?!?!, oh sorry mom"
I don't expect anything from them... and yet, they still disappointed me
Freaking love the moonlight sonata in the bkg lmao
I will unleash Flat Stanley upon this realm if you are not careful
Omg, I'm a life long Bucs fan... I bet my wife would say I sound just like this guy on sunday lol
Lmao!!!!!
It's the most wonderful time, of the year.
🤣🤣🤣 Thank You for sharing this!!! My DD & I were totally there too... Half those lines, we were Sooo there too!  All the way down to those last seconds.  We've seen them come back at the end... We had hope all the way till the end. 💔💙🏈 Maybe next yr.
He should've took off his jersey at the end...😁😁😁🤣🤣
None of my friends who are cowboys fans weren’t confident going into this game at all at San Fran is still overrated. Titans all the way this year
no one would blame you if you showed up wearing a Texans Jersey next season.. i may just join you..
HOW ‘BOUT THEM COWBOYS?! 😂😂😂
Doesn’t it feel like “Bad Day” by Daniel Powter is turning into the Dallas Cowboys Anthem yet?
As a packer fan, I feel your pain with McCarthy.  4th n 5+,  McCarthy: "let's go for it,"  End result: turnover on downs. 4th and 1, McCarthy let's just punt.
Try being a Vikings fan............
As an Eagles fan, I love football and I even like the team the Cowboys put together.  I dont understand how you can win 10 plus games over the years, win the division but cant win a playoff game. Id be upset as a fan too. There is only one thing i dont like about the Cowboys and that is Jerry Jones. He is the worst owner-GM. Ever since he ran Jimmy Johnson out of town they have never been the same.
That was great.
This s*** is hilarious as a charger fan in some ways we're much like cowboy fans
people ride scooters
Pray for this man, you are in my prayers...I can relate to this video...not yet but maybe after this weekend😆🤗
are you ok yet ? ! i feel your pain - kinda - i was pulling for dak and the boys after my pats got coldcocked in buffalo. but of course as  pats fans we haven't had much to bitch about in the last 20 years. somebody else's turn now. my condolences. the pats had 41 years of suck before 2001. fear not - the cowboys will be back
Cowboys lost because the team is a bunch of undisciplined high school kids.
They blame it on the last play but they got 8 extra seconds on their final drive
Damn, even I felt his pain...
We can't lose. I've talked too much trash.   That's when I lost it.
I talked to much trash for this
Dak isn't worth all that money ! He's good ..but not 40mil  good...
Cowboys suck
Dude, you are killing me...LOL!
PLEASE get rid of McCarthy and promote DQ to head coach. Let McCarthy go to Denver
Ok I don’t have a dog in the hunt ... but you are really good at this. Sorry you lost
You talked so much trash during the week lmao 🤣
Dak has to perform much better in big games if he wants to prove he's worth his contract.
How Cardinals Fans were too 💀😂
This was too accurate
Shout out to my Boyz boys Eddie and Gary...⭐oh...and go Chiefs 🤣
He got no friends. Poor Cowboy fans.
This guy is good!!!! I have same sentiments 😂😂😂😂
you are amazing, you tell it like it is
Long suffering 'Skins fans love drinking your tears.
Bro it's so funny cause this is what I say everything lmao
This is still a thing?
Man; I been waiting on since they lost😂😂😂
As a fan of the game... Ive said 95.9% everything said in this video
You win...................this is why I'm a Dallas Cowboys fan. Man I swear I said every word...........plus a few others and guess what, I can't wait to be even LOUDER next season. Every Cowboys fan needs to watch this video to recover. DC4L 🏈💙🏈💙🏈 Your work is Amazing and Hilarious 😂😂😂
Nick Boss hurt? Hope he feels better. After the game😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Toronto maple leafs of football
You expressed every single feeling and thought
on point... hahahaha
Screw the Dallas Cowgirls 🤣🤣🤣🤣
cowboys just suck
You have laughing so much I’m crying! Literally ! 😂
Football aside, this was some great acting and editing. Acting style reminds me of Keegan-Michael Key
Y’all trash this is y’all year y’all said clowns  🤡
Seen this a few times now I just enjoy the accuracy of this. Go niners bring on the packers
😆  niners 27 packers 13
🥂 too cowboys tears 🤣
Chargers last game...🤦🤦🤦
ScooterMagruder jinxed us by saying “WE ARE GOING TO THE SUPERBOWL!” 👎🏽🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Talking all that trash about the Eagles yet they have had a better team than Dallas since 95 lol
Bwahaha
“Y’all suck too.”  None of you guys play. The “players” only play.
Redskins fan,  this was my superbowl for this year....   mmmm
I watched bits of this with the sound down. Is this guy on drugs?
The game is rigged.
Who would win? 1. A state that eat, lives, and breathes football, rodeos, and 2,000 calorie burgers. 2. Some organic CBD oil users.
lmao
Lol hella funnyyyy
You should have seen me in that game.   When Garoppolo threw that INT, and I'm thinking- can't wait until Lance is there.  He won't miss an open reciever, or a dumb-a pass in the 4th quarter
It could be worse…. You can be 5-12, last in your division, with a bad offensive line.
Love you and your videos ❤️
😂😂😂😂 yall sorry as hell
American team? Lmao, this is why Cowboy fans should just, you know, curb their high expectations. Support sure, but don't overhype. I feel sorry for this fanbase. Heartbreak every year and they never learn.
Genius playing moonlight sonata in the background of this.
sorry but i want to hold no conversation about the dallas cowgirls or the sanfransissyco forty-decliners
His throat has to be killing him after this lol
I expect a kick to be the cause of the loss. Second would have been dumb penalties. Somehow even with the Cowboy losing to the Cowboys the 49ers still barely won. It's weird the NFL gave the 6 seed a bye.
Lol the Cowboys choke again
Bro! I feel you! Penalties and WHY DIDNT WE RUN TWO PLAYS AT THE END!!!!! WRONG TIME FOR A DRAW!!!!!! I'D RATHER HAVE TWO PLAYS IN THE END ZONE VS ONE! JUST SAYIN....OWELL
05:49 😂😂😂 you ain’t a real fan unless you’ve hit that 1000 yard stare after a loss.
*Fast forward to the start of next season* Cowboys fans: "THIS WILL BE OUR YEAR!"
hahaha!!!!
The refs added unnecessary time onto the clock during their last drive, Dem Boys choked and you can’t deny it
You miss the part talkin bout how the league in trouble cause the Boyz winning it all right after the loss
If I made that much money I would think the people who paid me would expect me to have a grasp of football fundamentals but unfortunately Dallas keeps setting bad records.
Your just lucky u like a team that’s makes the playoffs I’m a dolphins fan
I'm not going to bring up the fact that the Cowboys lost on that last play because Dak scrambled up the middle with no time on the clock, because that would be a cheap shot.  Also, the ref was doing his job. You can't hand it to your center, Dak. You need to find a ref.
This man just reenacted the Shango stream of the game. 😂
Literally  my whole mood smh
It's official: Tom Grossi doesn't need to do a fan reaction for the 'boys.  This wild 1 sums up their entire season in a nutshell.  Another brilliant product from a Clickbait Sports member.
"Game on nickelodeon look kinda hype" why did it though 🤣
the 49ers scored 6 points more than them.
The fact that this man can make an entire channel about the frustration felt as a cowboys fan speaks volumes about how much of a headache we suffer through EVERY year. Lol 🤣🤣🤦‍♂️☠️
I hate tony romo calling the games he just needs to shut up sometimes😒 I prefer Aikman, even though his passive aggression towards them is so evident
Hook and lateral is the correct term. Run a hook, toss a lateral
Pain
It's the Jerry vs Jimmy curse. Yes, Barry won a SB with that team but that team at that time could have coached themselves. If Jerry hadn't said what he did about any coach would win with that team Jimmy and the Boys would have won 4, maybe 5 in a row. It could have been the greatest dynasty EVER!
As a Raiders fan I feel your pain lol
Moonlight Sonata is apt for this.
Seahawks r better than cowboys.  They beat 9ers 2x
Only thing that would have made it even realer is if you had opened your laptop back up 20 seconds later and said “we’re gonna win the super bowl next year”
I laughed b4 this even started
Just be happy that your team played 14 out of 17 games within one score and go 6-8 in said games. Rough life for a vikes fan, not sure if those numbers are exactly correct just going off the top of my head but it’s been a rough 2 years. Hopefully a bright future coming to Minnesota.
"if they keep converting on 3rd down, they will win the game", lollll
It feels like a bad movie… and every season I am back to watch and get excited. Depression football team
I think the best for to do is burn that # 4 jersey now!!!! Dak is a hack and you just saw it for yourself.....
Our window shut this year
ScooterMagruder is my Dallas Cowboy Spirit in physical form
Is that moonlight sonata playing in the background?
I was already thinking of this video during the game
Yes u are. One and done team. Niners were better then u cowtoys/Cowgirls. Lol
1:01   Yes.
Next year: Cowboys gunna win the superbowl this year!!!
Loved it
Boyz had me 🔥
I called it, my brother was talking trash bc the patriots lost, and I told him cowboys were gonna lose bc of karma. And they choked another playoff run again.
Stephen A. Smith needs to see this.
This dude here🤣. He compliments his team when when their winning and give them the blues when they lose. He knows how to act like football fans👌🏿
Only thing better than watching Cowboy fans is Stephen A the day after..
Every one is so happy the Cowboys lost
Damn bro Scooter lost some weight since the last time I seen him pop up on my feed. Congrats 👏
“Are we gonna lose? Dang i talked way too much trash for this” *i felt that 😔*
Imagine having millions of dollars and a status and then get your stuff boxed up and get clowned on repetitively... unfortunately there isn't a vote every 4 years for THIS power struct "business" man to get booted out of the house. **(feel for Cowboys fans here... then I lost the feeling lol) Suggestion: Get a GM...
When the offense gasses the defense in the first quarter... game over
I had to subscribe to your channel because you are delusional?! I love to see you cowturd fans holler, scream, and most of all cry!!!!!!!!!!
Sports fandom is the dumbest thing ever!!!  One team wins a season which means you are destined for disappointment 99% of the time!!!
Don't worry. Next year is the cowboys year... Or maybe the after that... Lol
I’m not buying another Bootleg jersey,key Chain or anything else to support the Cowboys or Bootlegger’s like dude said at the end of this video “I’am Done” until we win another Championship!!!
Dont worry man, this is could have easily been done with us Packers fans.
Quit flapping your jaws! You got no respect for the other teams. First, the Birds played their depth chart, so your "convincing victory" was a kid if crap. Furthermore, fire your coach. He lacks basic knowledge Of the game. No idea how to manage the clock, looks to the assistants for help. Like he doesn't know what in the hell is going on. Lastly, absolutely, positively, no running game. The best offense in the league, held to 70 yds. on 20 carries, 140÷ yds. on penalties. Tgat's what list the game, bro. Your team, your coach.
I love you man! 😂
Haven’t seen one of his videos for about 2 years and bruh.  He look like he aged by 10 years.
Why is this is true tho 😂😂
Play this on a loop off season cow bois
God that was so me.  Don't talk to me for 24 hours.  I didn't want to watch anymore football that day either.  I went to bed early.
Bears fan here, and I can totally relate. This captures the ups and downs of being a fan.No one contact me for the next 48 hours!
As a 49ers fan this was my Super Bowl. I took great pleasure in watching them beat the Cowboys and will spend the rest of the week enjoying videos like these. I don't even care if they lose to the Packers at this point. 😂
That was awesome
*Are you the guy I watched on Endurance as a kid?* *You're the goat bruh*
ha ha haha ha!
I’ve never been so butt hurt on a game we should’ve won.
I'll give you a lot of flack on here and social media I'm a diehard Eagles fan but I'll tell you what you do some good work bro keep it up stay blessed
No way we should’ve lost we had another off game we need to be more consistent
I felt this…
im a 49er fan it was a close game
Oh that's hilarious!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I am a Bills fan....not a Cowboys fan, but I can so so relate. Plus, your videos are put together so well, I love it.
Perfect way to end this video,we feed up wit this  💯
Any time Jerry Jones and Co. take one on the chin I'm happy. This video ran through a laundry list of emotions. I was dying 🤣😂😂🤣🤣
LMFAOO
Sweet tears. Delicious.
I was waiting for this one! 🤣🤣🤣
Go niners ;)
Dallas 1996:  we got 5 rings though. Dallas 2021: we got 5 rings though   Great video though.  🇺🇸😎👍
It’s always such a joy to see Dallas lose.  Especially in the playoffs.  Seeing the Giants beat them in the playoffs was a dream come true.
Scooter, do you want to talk about it now?
Feels great baby ❤
Wow look it’s the same video you always make what a talent
As a Rams fan, I'd like to welcome you to the fold.  You don't know you want it yet, but it could be the cure for your frustration.  Troy Aikman ain't walking through that door.  Emmitt isn't walking through that door.  But Cooper and OBJ would be more than happy to take you into the family.
httr, dude!
😂😂😂
It was a SAD SAD SAD performence!!!
See you next season.
I thought nothing could be more annoying than watching the actual Dallas Cowboys, I was wrong.
Like skip says how bout them cowboys 🤣🤣🤣
The first time ole boy blinked all video was when he shut the laptop at the end😂
McCarthy is 3-0 against Dallas in the playoffs!
Very Accurate. Also Ran around my room screaming the entire 4th quarter
From a cowboys fan that is how I reated the entire game
3:50.  Not what happened.  We went for it and jimmy snuck it and got it but he snapped the ball before trent williams was set and thus set us back 5 yards.  If jimmy doesnt fuck that up we put the cowboys away there.  Yet another time we tried to give this game away and yet yall still blew it.
Bro, the only cowboys fans that were surprised by this loss are the ones that haven’t been paying attention the last 26 years. Also this dude bought a Dak Jersey lolz.
Saints fan here......So funny!
To be a one and done team.. you kinda need the “one” first
I will feel slightly better once Aaron Rogers picks the Niners apart on Saturday.  -Cowboys fan
Damn bro, that’s exactly me there.😂😂😂😂😂
LOL come take a seat with us Eagles fans, Scooter, and we can watch the rest of playoffs together 🤣
We tried to tell you abt mike mcarthy
The streets been waiting for this
Bwahaha imagine being a Panthers fan…
As a Washington fan, i can relate to pain of disappointment year after year. Only thing that made it feel a little ok was Eagles and Dallas losing same week :) Know what? we shall see y ou next year for more of the same! Love the videos man. Keep your chin up. At least Dallas has talent.
Forgot the part where the cowboy's fan says "we'll get the win next year"
“Why do I give them so much time of my life” I felt that
It was really bad
This man speak the truth one and done team!!!
Go Birds
How bout them Hypeboys?
straight  FUNNY!
Every year same result,  How bout dem Cowboys!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rams fan, here. Fuck the 49ers!
This was 100% accurate. Lol. #GoNINERS
Good old Dallas....🤡 They'll win another super bowl once Jerry ain't involved with the team, it's the jimmy curse 😬
I know the Cowboys lost but all joking aside, you don't look like yourself? You've lost weight. Everything good? Can't wait for Offseason videos and trade videos.
bruh I feel you pain shit be killing me year after year. But we got it next year 🤣 ✭ ✭ dcfl
It's OK Cowboys Pats got stomped by the Bills which made me oddly upset if it were anyone else it would been fine but the Bills. Ugh
You want to talk about it?
You still doing this skit? Lol you’ll be doing it for life repping the Cowboys G
Hahahahhahahahahahaha ahhhh cowboys hahahhahaha
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Something tells me the Niners are going to feel karma in the penalty realm. Playing the Packers at Lambeau field. Winter is coming.
Lmao
LOL!!!!!
5:50 that was a genuine ass reaction 😭💀
Um... Go Gators???
Lol this year, for Cowboys fans, went from the regular disappointment that they have every year to just straight disgust and anger with this team 😭💀. Like dudes were ready to book a flight to Dallas so that they could "talk" to Mccarthy 🤣
suck it cowboys 😎
I love this lol
Yeah, how about those COWGIRL’s, “GO 49er’s”
“I’m sorry Mom…” 🤣
Dak Prescott to Tom Brady: *"We'll see y'all again"*  Maury: *"The Lie detector determined THAT was a lie"*
This was so on point !!!
Dallas can think of this way. They're guaranteed a spot on the playoffs every year because their division is a dumpster fire. Not everyone can claim that.
Oh god it hurts 😭😭😭😂😂
I'm honestly so happy Cowboys lost. Absolutely deserved.
Gaming upstairs while listening to people watch this game was incredibly annoying 😒
I don't know who KC brought in to teach Andy Reid about time management, but Dallas really needs to see about poaching him
As an Eagles fan, at least the Cowboys gave us something to cheer for.
As a packer fan, it makes my heart happy knowing Jerry hired him and Dallas fans can experience what we have felt for over a decade :)
"Is this how Eagles fans felt earlier cause this is ridiculous" 😂
Cowboys just doing cowboys things is all.
Stephen A Smith watched this video 100 time already 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣
They got slime? 😂
Come on cowboys all because of penalties
Hilarious!...this is exactly the way it was!
"Penalties will be the death of us!!!" 😆
Our Eagles were garbage too…but this game still made us smile.
Ya love to see it. Time to rest up and add more delusions in the offseason.  Ya bums...
I'm a niner fan, and I have a bad feeling this is gonna be me this saturday
Dallas got exposed!!! Justice was served
At least you understand it wasn’t the refs fault the cowboys lost the game
Next year y’all will be them boys for sure
I am a transplanted Panther fan from NC living in San Antonio. I work around some die hard cowboy fans who talked endless crap all season constantly every conference call they shouted "lets go cowboys" to end the meetings. Loved getting on the conference call following this game all you heard were crickets and a few of them even ducked the meeting so they didn't have to deal with people asking them about another cowboys playoff loss. It was glorious.
The accuracy is unreal lol.
Cowpoke fans act like they spike the ball they win the game.  They STILL had to make a difficult 30 yard throw for a TD just to TIE.  Then make a PAT to win.  I was a HUGE Cowboy fan back in the 70's up until JJ took over and treated Tom Landry like some 3rd year hack coach who deserved to be unceremoniously fired.  Screw them.  I'm a Packer fan first, and whoever is playing the cowpokes 2nd....I don't care if they win a Super Bowl the year JJ's kid takes over just as long as they don't win one with him still running the team.
SO MUCH PAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! also somehow you were unsubscribed?"
The sweet sweet tears of cowboy fans taste so good.
The Jags an Jets have more playoff wins than the Cowboys do since there last superbowl in 1996...
I want to see scooter magruder have a talk with Shannon sharpe and Stephen a. Smith
“WHAT DO YOU WANT, oh sorry mom” lmao
Yeah team is mad undisciplined. All the mistakes from the Cowboys aside, there was SOOOOO much missed on the 49ers it's insane. Over 50 yards WELL over 50 yards... Is a game changer, but nah, lets ignore majority of those calls lol. And McCarthy needs to go, I gave him the benefit of the doubt last season due to losing Dak, but now? Nah, multiple times he's proven to be bad with time management, and he called for Dak to run it at the end.
I'm back again to watch your misery
This team gave up a thousand yard rusher in penalties across the regular season...there is no internal football discipline for this soap opera.  Jones' legacy is stark: he made a transcendent hire in Jimmy Johnson, won three Super Bowls with Jimmy's players, then ego cursed this franchise since then...Johnson was reading - and implementing - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Jones was watching Johnson, petty and jealous.  Imagine being a valuable loser where generations now of hand me down legacy fans have never even seen you compete in a conference championship.  A joke.  The Red Sox had the Curse of the Bambino.  We have the Curse of Firing Jimmy Johnson.  Until Jones admits that as a GM he has not (since that firing) cannot (now) and will not (in the future) deliver in any role other than owner-at-a-distance, the Cowboys will in fact give only what we have in fact gotten: more decades of being the Ebenezer Ekuban, the David LaFleur, the Bobby Carpenter of the national football league...the Morris Claiborne, if you will.  I once applied to work for the franchise; rolled up with a Kinko's resume and cover letter on giant poster board (cause everything is bigger in Texas); glad they turned me down.  Imagine being responsible for two and half decades of having diamond level resources and delivering truly garbage outcomes...almost too much to bear in terms of where a staff member or fan might put their energy.  Cowboys Nation?  Cowboys pride? In what exactly, besides my childhood memories in the 70s and my college memories in the 90s?  What, we're supposed to take pride in the fact that no one in leadership - not the owner, not the head coach, not the QB - begins and end in accountability (revealing a broken culture of excuse-making that never produces a winner at anything, ever)? I'm supposed to join McCarthy in intimating that the refs, or some aspect of the moment, or luck, or angst, is the problem, and not a record-setting fourteen penalties?  We're supposed to focus on how the refs ostensibly prevented  one play at the end, and not on the paucity in the game plan that could not get the ball to your star WR and hid the injury to your RB all year ( and didn't shift to emphasize carries to an emergent talent like Pollard)?  No.  My odium for the football culture in Dallas increases with every submission from these well paid loss leaders... A disgrace really.
"Thank you Jimmy G for missing him". -9ers fan feelin it
What makes me feel better as a skins fan is watching all the fights that took place during and after the game. I also liked watching Dallas fans throwing trash at their own players as they walked off the field. Just reminds me that the fans, team and stadium are trash
I told Cowboy fans Mike McCarthy was trash. They called me a madman.  Lol 1 and done team
“We can’t lose this game, I talked too much trash” 😂
Great video! You missed the sun in the players eyes Dak threw it was huge
As a giant fan im.so happy yall lost 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was literally like this the whole game😂😞
Dak blamed the ref for his extra 5 yard run. What a doofus.
Poor scoots
Your content is hilarious bro I'm a huge cowboys fan and I can honestly say this was half my family and friends that day 😂 keep up the good and stay blessed you and your loved ones 🙏
Been a Cowboys fan since the days of Tom Landry, Dandy Don Meredith, Leroy Jordan ---- et al  -- have never seen such a poor display of self discipline -- they do not deserve to win.
https://youtu.be/WHpVijbpLR4
You forgot the “we winning the super bowl next year” at the end. Typical cowboy fan phrase
The Chris Tucker movie?! You mean Friday?! Let me get tht Black card brother 🥲
Yea.. so true add a lot of cus words and you me watching the game
4:41 when all hope is lost
The phone call from clown Eagles fans. This is life for Philly Cowboys fans. And I'm not even a Cowboys fan.
Dak Prescott is a thief after stealing that contract he didn't deserve
How the refs left the game. Lmao
The Tony Romo comment was foreshadowing the ending
Do the p acker 49er game scooter
Cowboys stink.
Im sorry mom 😆 🤣 😂
I'm sorry calling a qb run with 14 seconds is just stupid. Not only that everyone on the Offensive should know that the ref has to touch the ball. He should have been looking for the ref or went down 5 yards earlier. Not give the ball to your center then block people in from getting to the other side to touch the ball. The reason why they lost? They killed there self with stupid flags. Seems like ever sense there last super bowl win they been cursed with the 1 an done. In the last 20 years  Dallas only has 3 play off wins. Don't get me wrong your 1990's team was unstoppable at times. Sadly the 2000s has been a curse.
As a 49ers fan, this was PERFECT! * Chef’s Kiss * 🤣🤣🤣 Thank you!
I'm still laughing at the Cowboys loss
Being a lifelong cowboy fan (since 1976)....this is the way i looked at that game....did we commit a lot of penalties? Yes...Did our defense stink in the 1st half? Yes....Did mccarthy make some stupid decisions? Yes....but im sorry...for me...more of the blame goes to the $75 mill dollar QB....ive been saying hes not worth all that money from day one...and sunday proved it...he SUCKED...if dak had played up to his contract...nobody is talking about all the other stuff....Dallas was the most penalized team in the NFL...mccarthy had time mgmt issues ALL SEASON....so this game was no different....Dak thru 3 qtrs had 143 yards 1 td and 1 int....and 7 points...UNACCEPTABLE!!! We will NOT win with Dak as our qb.....unless everything is 'perfect' for him....he is not the type of qb that overcomes adversity....there are at LEAST 8-9 qb id rather have than him (Brady, Rodgers, Allen, mahomes, Jackson, burrow, herbert, Wilson, Murray (even tho he stunk)....hell id rather have STAFFORD.....dak Prescott is a glorified kirk cousins!!!
I'm so glad you guys have Mike McCarthy now, instead of us.
5:27 You can't invest too much into the Cowboys. Jerrah built the team to make waves in the regular season. I couldn't get excited at all this year because I have seen this ending too many times.
Being a Cowboys fan born after 96 is like hearing great stories about a local town legend all your life but when you meet them they’re a drunk, washed up shell of their former self.
Until Jerry bites the dust, nothing will change. 🤡
I do feel sorry for Cowboys fans. Their owner is a hype man, their team plays in the weakest conference and weakest division in the NfL, has the softest schedule every year so when they play a team with a winning record they are shocked they can’t win. Truth is, it’s not just the coaches, it’s that you have a mediocre QB who requires 4-5 seconds to find a wide open receiver. Anything less and well you lose. Only gonna get worse since Jerry made him the highest paid QB in the league. 😂
packers tried to warn you about mike mccarthy. but honestly it took us long enough to get rid of him.
I’m a chargers fan, and at least you didn’t make the playoffs over a terrible time out in the final 2 seconds of overtime for one of the best kickers in the NFL to kick the game winning touchdown X| (by the way we should have won that cowboys game in week 2 over a stupid game winning field goal)
The only one you want  calling a Cowboys game is Tony Romo?  No Aikman?
Can apply to us Raiders fans too tbh.
Lock Jerry up.
Lock  Jerry up
Lock Jerry up.
Bosa got prescot he gonna get ya he gonna ya
My Dad has been a Cowboys fan his whole life so he’s used to the Cowboys disappointed him 😔 But he stopped watching the game at halftime I think since they did so good earlier this season he had hope.
Now that's Fanatic Football Right there! Niner fan since Kezar days and I'm just like this Fool! Now this was as brutal a Loss for your tribe as the "How bout dem Cowboys" loss in 1993 for Niner fans... But "hopefully" You fans of Dallas aren't "Delusional" anymore! You're Division is Pathetic! But at least in the 90's Our two teams were the Best an that was considered the Super Bowl for both Tribes! As the AFC was Pathetic back then. Still is to Me!  So let this be a lesson to your Tribe. Don't count you're chickens with 14 seconds left! For all the Asian numerologists know that the number 14 couldn't be more associated with Evil. As both numbers point Down! Down to that thin wire that Dak hung your Season on! And August is only 7 months away to get back to this point for you. So don't Trip Dallas! And Lastly... "How Bout Dem Cowboys"...
Golden State Giants and 49ers San Francisco Still Faithful Since 1982 Playing With Fire
WTF !!!! I'm so over this S*+T
HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS🤣🤣🤣
true....true
you didn't punch your TV. not accurate.
Waited a few days to watch this hoping I could appreciate the humor.  Nope... raw agony again.  This is brutal.
WE WARNED YOU ABOUT MCCARTHY THE FRAUD!
It was the background music for me. 👀 #NYG 😂
Dude, this was done so well that you almost made me like Dallas... LOLOLOL  I can't wait to see your video next year.. LOLOL!!!  Excellent video....
Yes, we were right about McCarthy 🤣
Urban Meyer needs a job. Just saying.
Dak Prescott is a f****** horrible quarterback. Peyton Manning never got offered that kind of money. Dak Prescott got all that money because he was black and that was it. He don't have what it takes between the ears to be a quarterback, he's too slow
As an Eagles fan, I wish we had a ScooterMagruder. Seems like it would make the losses more enjoyable somehow
love your content! Its great keep it up bro!
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well it could be worse, you could be a Falcons fan like me :(
"WHAT DO U WANT!! srry mom..."🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣that's gold
Ceedee lamb has one catch. Terrible play calling.
Wow I was exactly like that during the game. Word for word!!!!
your show and fake jerry are the only things I look forward to regarding the dallas cowboys. I dread everything else and the worst part is the worse they play, the better you guys are. I'm so conflicted, is this my fault?
After watching this, i feel your pain.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
He should've fast-forwarded a day and been like "NEXT SEASON IS OUR YEAR!"
This was literally how I acted. Spot on.
NOBODY CONTACT ME FOR 24 HOURS. Picks up Phone. I'm sorry mom.
They lost in the most Dallas way possible 💀😭😂😂
Scooter you need to get a check up. You don’t look healthy
Pollard is way better than Zeke!!!
The cowboys are the leafs
Cowboys going to the Super Bowl for the 20th Year in a row!!! Lol
“Didn’t y’all lose earlier” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Eagles suck too
Bet...this was skip bayless
Dal-last place lol! The reason they lost is because they are trash! Thats why it was thrown on the feild lol
Raise you hand if you came here to see his face after Dak scrambled.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 exactly how I feel
You deserved this
That was amazing  lmao no cap Mt mom called me when my nines lost to the chiefs  I acted the same way
Welp this one was rough
Cowboys suck😂😂😂😂
"Must be nice to have a competent kicker. My gosh." 😁😁😂😂🤣🤣😭😭
Yeah,even trashier than Philly Fans- Cowboys aren't America's team either
how bout dem cowgirls
Funny how he went from watchin the tv to the laptop….lmao
Scooter might be the only Cowboys fan I don't hate hahahahaha
WHAT DO U WANT??? I’m sorry mom 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😞😞😞😞😞
Like how your watching the game on 2 different couches an in the kitchen 😂😂
Can't say we didn't warn you.
As lifelong fan of the cowboys fan all I can say is I'm not surprised. They just not going to get over that hump
We was waiting on this vid. I love how reality sets in @ 5:47. Lol
Its funny to see what the niners do to yalls teams
Cowboys lost the moment they gave into Dak and Zeke, those 2 retired as soon as they got their money.
This is some funny shit!
As long as jerry jones is running this team mark my words they will never win a superbowl.
See ya next season eagles boy
Definitely me on game day. The Cowboys showed up. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
🎵 The accident waiting to happen🎵
I was with you until you threw in that John 3:16
Read all these comments and haven’t seen anyone say that the 49ers have better players and a better team?! Line up all the talent on both teams and 4/5 of your top picks would be 49ers players.. Cowboys are just a media created hype machine for casual fans
Yea what ever. .sucks to be a cowboys fan.. But that's some talent ,  As we say n Hollywood. You haven't arrived,till U been imitated  DC4vr
As someone who got into football when Fox took over NFC contract felt so wrong to watch 49ers v Cowboys on CBS, had a feeling that Aikman was cheated having to call the Bucs.
I loooove the fact that the cowgirls fans are always talking shit about dem liberals in San Francisco and the cowgirls lost to the very type that cowgirl fans can't stand. There's so much justice in it. Now ..... how bout dem boys ?   L o L
Lol he is funny. An i am probly the biggest cowboy hater of all. So i love hearin them cry an make up excuses. But his videos r hilarious
Eagles fan who loved every second, good vid
NiNeR GaNG!!!!
Packer fan here just chiming in. I love the video it made me laugh. As to the reason the cowboys lost. Mike Mccarthy has always been very careful to not lose. Never went out to win. Aaron rodgers did that for him. Sadly Dak is still figuring that out. Just my opinion. (Sad it wasnt Aaron and the Packers to send yall home again ngl) 😉
Lmfao Dak is garbage... Stop making excuses for a game manager! He's not a game CHANGER
49ers were the better TEAM??  Maybe??
5:16  In the wise words of Bishop Bullwinkle, hell naw to the naw naw naw hell to the naw
Lmfao the cowboys are pathetic Don't worry same things gonna happen next year 😂🤣😂   Most overrated franchise in all of pro sports.
We need to get Russell Wilson, Aaron Rodgers, or Deshaun Watson in here ASAP, cut or trade Zeke and start Pollard next year... fire McCarthy, go get Sean Payton. Can we talk Andrew Luck out of retirement?
“NO CONTACT ME FOR 24 HOURS, I’M SO SERIOUS!”  (ring) “WHAT DO YOU WANT?!” “I’m sorry mom.”  🤣🤣🤣
I felt like I was watching the game all over again lol
💯
Lmao
Dak's 6 year "slump." 🤣
You should put it in your will to have Cowboys players carry your casket when you die "so they can LET YOU DOWN one last time".
Camera guy?  I see you.  Very Nice work!  Very.  All the little snap zooms and movement.  Perfect 👍
My wife was laughing. Exactly how I sounded almost to a tee..lol.
Hahahahhaha!!!!!!!!!  Nice work!!   You win.   Most real deal LOL’s ever in one video for me.  Seriously..  Gooood Stuff brother! 🤙🤙🤙
Whoever put the subtitles does't understand football terms lol
Incredible bruh. I only watched the game once, but that's how I remember it being for sure
Let's go
You forgot to end it with the typical Cowboys fan's default line of "We'll win the Super Bowl next year, just you watch!"
Lmaoo ninerrrrsssss. cowboys ass😂
😂 😂 😂
Dak NVP pretty nice though
Absolutely brilliant. Helps us to experience an accurate description of tragic ride of a winner that loves to lose.  A true modern tale of twisted fate. Sorry boys.
Eagles were supposed to be garbage Cowboys were supposed to win the super bowl. Both ended there seasons at the same time
Eagles fan after the Cowboys vs 49ers game....😂😂😂😂😂
OMG, Scooter; don't give yourself a heart attack over the Boys. Jerry cursed his own team with the firing of Jimmy after the two Superbowls in the early 90s. It was Jimmy's team NOT Jerry's. Sure they won one more time but all those members were part of Jimmy's team. So long as Jerry has so much control, Dallas will never win again unless some miracle happens. Gr8 video!
I think the most disappointing thing was the oline getting bullied and they didn’t even have nick bosa the whole game smh
Debo Samuel is a grown man
This was beautiful it might suck but it’s content gold man
Bru… 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️cowboy fan and that was me during the game…
At least we not the cards
Sooo the WFT’s last playoff run was against the greatest quarterback of all time and we almost won  This was one of my favorite games to watch of the year so thanks for that
Lol go niners baby!
comedy
Pretty accurate….except they really didn’t utilize CeeDee Lamb at all…..Funny AF😂
How about them cowboys!!!!😂😂😂😂😂. 9ers!!!!!
I feel your pain Bro.  you sound like me yelling at the TV!!🤣
4:55  "We got the most talent in the league."  Um, no.  Not by a long shot.  Worst owner who thinks he's a coach and can buy a championship.  Worst coach who wasted Aaron Rodgers talent and now Dak's.  I loved the video because I'm a long suffering Giants fan and my father is a Dallas fan!
Penalties and time management were an issue throughout the season, giving the other team extra chances. In a playoff game, those kinds of mistakes are the difference between being one of the best teams and being out after 1 game. Disciple and preparation can fix those 2 issues if they acknowledge that was their weakness and work on it. (Cowboys fan)
This was half my family 🤣🤣🤣
That cowboys interception part was definitely me🤣🤣 swore they could comeback after that😔😥
Not going to lie. This is how I act... Next year boys!
Come on now boys 😆
I'm never one to kick a man when he's down but his rant was everything 😂😂😂 damn scooter you was bout to cuss mom out l....just made my day wit that one💯
Maybe the cowgirls shouldn't let Romo call their games anymore....he is still making them lose at the last seconds 🤔
Should have ended it with delusional optimism for next season.
HILARIOUS🤣🤣
Cheer up Mr. Magruder. At least you're not a Vikings fan.
Hell yeah we were right about McCarthy🤣🤣🤣
Its not as bad as you think At least the cowboys didn't lose to their own zamboni driver
Scooters pain brings me much joy in direct proportion to the trash he talked during the regular season.
Thank you for this my boy.  The therapy because I was all off this and some.
I'm  dead. The Eagles got curb stomped but we were just happy to be there. Y'all paid Dak 75 million 😂😂😂. Zeke got 100 million. Cooper got 100 million.  Y'all payed EVERYBODY for that
To be a one and done team, you kinda gotta win the first game 😂
hilarious1!!
Aww the tears of Cowgirls fans are so sweet
how it feels to have less playoff wins than nick foles in the past 20 years?
How to trigger a Cowboys fan: Mike McCarthy is 3-0 against the Cowboys in the playoffs
The reffing was atrocious this season
Not a Cowboys fan at all, but I feel bad for Scooter.
BRO PLEASE make one of Steelers fans watching the Chargers/Raiders game! I would share it all across the lands.
“We can’t lose I talked too much trash for this” we have all felt that at some point in our lives
Cowboys and Yankees fans are one in the same
I ain’t ever felt one like the end there brother. DC4L
sorry i can't relive this game again.. but i smashed a like for ya bro...
It's like I tell my friends that are Cowboys fans and always want to tell me "we run the east". Don't worry about running the east, worry about running the playoffs. And next year Cowboys fans will talk all kinds of crap like they been winning Super Bowls for the last 20 years, lol
Scootermagruder I love your videos I am a kanas city cheafs but you are so much better than Steve dangle in my opinion cheers from Ottawa Canada
Scooter nails it to the bitter end. Come for the humor, feel the pathos, and stay for the ending rant - boy, does he speak for Cowboy Nation.... the laptop closes...
I can remember back in the 60s the talk was....the Cowboys can't win the big one.   Nowadays, the talk is.....they can't even win a playoff game....lol.
I GIVE THIS VIDEO 5 STARS  CAN'T STOP CRYING FROM LAUGHING!!!☺😄😆😅🤣
😆😆😆😅😅😅
Scooty Magrudy
Lol Eagles season was a very positive one. What positive came of the Cowboys season?
Lol this was exactly what happened
WAIT TIL NEXT CENTURY...
I SWEAR I WAS JUST LIKE THIS THE WHOLE SORRY ASS GAME!!!🙄🤔☺😄😅😆🤣😤😠😡
As a 49ers this funny asf gg y’all
My fav video so far ❤️
49ers fans during the (every) game, literally every offensive play: don’t fuck this up Jimmy, no negative plays….
😆😂🤣🤣
14 Penalties, Aren't these guys professional NFL players? You would think if all you did was play football, you would know the rules, and not commit infractions 14 times...
🤣🤣🤣 COM MO DEE
I'm a niners fan and that ending in the last 8 minutes had me on the edge of my seat. But in the end we got the dub
You are hilarious, How bout Dem Cowboys🤠! Hahahaha 🤣 Hahahaha 🤣 Hahahaha Hahahaha 🤣 Hahahaha 🤣 Hahahaha Hahahaha Hahahaha 🤣
The cowgirls do it again 🤡🤪🤯🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Very well done
I'm a Niners fan so I know how you feel,  I've been a fan since 1980 so I've been through the Montana / Young  years so  the past couple of decades I know exactly how you feel usually it's SF that's going out early.  Sorry for your loss.
Hilarious and I’m a Eagles fan
Prepare to be disappointed every year with jerry jones running the show
I love it!
Hahahaha get good being there and waving 👋🏽 “Byyyyeeee, LOSERS!!” As their fans started leaving with 5 min left.
I am an eagles fan and I must admit we suck tooo lol 😂
Let’s keep it a buck. As cowboys fans.. We knew the outcome from the start.
Blame the refs. Come on, let’s hear you whine.
As an Eagles fan, this makes me happy.
Love the moonlight sonata in the background my guy.
🤣🤣 How about dem CowGirls!!!
Who was here just to see the end?
Man got 5 tv’s in his house so he can roam around the house and still have the game on. Smart
8 months later: THIS IS OUR YEAR
GREAT VIDEO MAN! YOU'RE AS BAD AS ME! CHOUCH COACH! I'm sorry you're Cowboys lost....9ers got lucky....Cowboys were stupid....Love the rivalry.  Great vid man. I thought Dallas had this one. 😨...and I've been a Niner for 37 years.
A bunch of these videos have been great. This is my favorite because I feel like we got more of a play by play.
This was so acurate!!😂🤣
pain.
Lol this is furiously accurate 🤣  Leggo 9ERS.
Agh the tears of cowboys fans are delicious :)
I think the blowout win against the Eagles 3rd string team in Week 18 made them think they were better than what they actually are. Go Birds!
There are 3 things guaranteed in life.   Death Taxes Scooter Magruder being disappointed by the Cowboys
being a Cowboys fan must hurt Dallas could literally go undefeated all season and somehow still never make it to the SB
Why does Scooter look like he's 60 in the pic
The 49ers are gonna lose to the packers anyways
Niner let's go
Damn Scooter, figured you would be dressed as a 49ers cheerleader for this video.
I love this video
Great Video!! And that is what we were saying during the game!
True Cowboys fans still think they will win the Super Bowl this year
I convinced the manager at the restaurant I work at to air the Nick game.
I mean this as a compliment. You and your face are just funny. 🤪
Definition of insanity
My bro can’t watch this video too painful for me but I’m going to hit the like button
One and done team sounds like a 2 pump chump team lol
I feel your pain. I've been a fan since the Tom Landry days & I've never felt this way after a playoff loss. I have no hope for a different outcome in the years to come.
This is pretty much how it went down when I was watching the game too.
“Why do I give so much time of my life for this?” That one hit hard as a packers fan who watches his team close to February every year and never sees his team win
I felt the opposite of how you felt. Im a niners fan and it was very stressful at the end there.
Epic Fail!!! Everytime, how bout them cowgirls...
micah parsons was held but i've learned to stop caring completely
What can go wrong will go wrong
Fucking everyone knew they were one and done.  You're kidding yourselfs if you thought this year was going to be different.
I'm seriously done with them.  Only 3 playoff wins since 97.  I'm legit done watching and rooting for this losing ass franchise.  Y'all can keep being miserable.  They are the true joke of the NFL.  Biggest franchise in the world and this is the same result year after year they give their fans??  I'm done losing my mind every year.  Fuck dem boyz!!!  🖕🖕
Here’s what needs to happen. Jerry needs to sit down Coach Mike…….stare at him for 5 minutes…..and ask him……”Did Dez Bryant catch the ball”?….. if he says anything other than yes, kick him to the curb…..he’s a cheesehead operative.
Remember, the NFC East does have back to back winners. The Cowboys wasted their turn.
That's how we do it. Go 9ers! 😆
The greatest catch in Cowboys History was a Hail Mary Pass they never thought to get "closer" before the throw. Just heave it let one of your great athletes make the play and in that case beat the Vikings and go on to the Super Bowl
"We can't lose, I talk too much trash for this."--Every.  SINGLE.  Cowboys fan in the DC/Metro area!
That shit was lit🔥🔥🔥🔥🤣😂
😢
No maybes about it we are Americas one and done team 😭
I click so fast after cowboys lose for his reaction lol.
Cowboys put that stupid screen up there.  It should only be a replay if the visiting team kicks it.
“ this is our year we’re going to the super bowl” ha ha ha ha ha
Dallas Sucks!
I don’t watch football and I didn’t get anything of what he was saying but it sounds painful
Accurate.  I'm still in hiding.
That Debo comment was it. Love it
Meanwhile, I, a Lions fan...
Cry me a River
I love the Cowboys loosing I’m a never Cowboys fan they Suck
Really liked this content.. Sincerely 49er fan since 1979..
24 year old Cowboys fan here, never seen them in a Superbowl and idk if i ever will. Dallas always finds a way to lose in spectacular fashion in the playoffs
Scooter is garbage that's why.
😂😂😂😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It's really difficult seeing your favorite professional sports team struggle like this in the playoffs.  I mean, it's the DALLAS COWBOYS!!  With our strong tradition of winning, we should not be exiting the playoffs in the first round.  I think we are still paying for our owner letting Jimmy Johnson go back in the mid-90s when we were winning Super Bowls.  Karma is a bitch.  Coach Johnson is the best coach we've had since Landry.  We have not won shit since he left.
LMMFAO
The Cowboys need to sign AB purely so they can have both AB and CeeDee
All those records! Team wins the division just to lose wildcard weekend a few hrs after the Eagles who are winning in rebuild mode. You had expectations! Win at least 1 playoff game. You guys can't do anything right. Cool vid tho!
How the Cowboys can suck this bad for so long yet be one of the highest paid franchises in sports boggles my mind. Which leads me to believe they’re a brand more than an actual talented dedicated sports team. The Jones family killed Dallas Cowboys football.
LMAO😅
Are you really sure about “most talent in the league”?
Being a Cowboys fan is hard… Also, I clearly remember the last time I was this disappointed - the infamous Dez Bryant non-catch against the Packers…
MALIK HOOCKER ?? 😂😂😂 THAT GOT ME , COMING FROM HIS HOME TOWN NICE , GO CANES 🎆🏅🏅🥰
"Must be nice to have a competent kicker" was my favorite one as a Niners fan we wouldnt have won if it wasnt for Gould Rush
Bosa out?  I hope he feels better.  After this game. 😆 🤣 😂
Do they have slime?
How bout dem cowboys!!!
"Why do I give them so much time of my life..FOR THIS!?" - most football fans
Nah man I felt that loss all week before the game, I knew they wouldn't pull it off. Hoped for the best but prepared for the worse. Softened the blow a little bit.
that was pretty awesome  😍
Fanbase reactions: Cowboys fans:  REEEEEEEEEE (on suicide watch) 49ers fans:  YEAAAAH told you so! Giants, Eagles, WFT fans:  Thank you 49ers!  You're my second favorite team this week!  Packers fans:  Sorry Cowboys, we understand your pain.  Been there done that.  Not a fan.
As a 49ers fan, I find this delicious.
ABAHAHAHAHA
How many times did I hear the name Cedrick Wilson?🤣🤣
I'm afraid for Scooter if they ever go to the Superbowl and lose
One star for one and done.
to paraphrase the great Tom Grossi, you know that scene at the end of amazing spider-man 2 where they're fighting and the clock tower falls apart? That was better clock management than Mike McCarthy.
Haha get dogged on.
Like most Cowboy fans, this guy's a gasbag.
YES
I see that Florida Gators helmet in the background!---> #gogators 🐊🐊🐊🏈
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Packer fan watching : ………….wait….reallly………….. did this game just end on the ball being set by the ref?
Cowboy fans: stop being delusional. Expect the possibility that a loss can happen. It’s why y’all the most obnoxious fan base in the league. Dak cost them the game. You can’t run down the middle. You cannot spot your own ball. I have spoken.
Dayum UCF is ya best team I see why you don't make college football vids no mo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Go 49ers
Cowboyfan for life and maybe the real blame is the owner J Jones.We haven't had a good coach who puts fear in his players since Jimmy J.Since 95 is a damn shame shameful you got us all fooled Mr Jones maybe go chill on your  boat  and count your money ..Maybe  he should listen to Troy. Get rid of the OC let him walk and take the HC with him if not it will be the same shit again next year and years to come.I live in Seattle WA and I'm tired of Hawk fans throwing out we haven't won anything since 1995.Thats a long time ago to damn long.Maybe Jerry.fire yourself
When you play the Giants - Skins and Eagles twice each in a season and you have an average team, which is what the cowboys were this season,  you look much much better.
A perfect microcosm of why I'm no longer associating myself as a Cowboys fan. I'm done with this bullshit.
I wanted it to be a 56-0 blowout. lol i forgot about heartbreakers my eagles got molly whooped but it was to be expected. this as bad as the romo playoff game in 06 lololol.
“Don’t talk to me for 24 hours!” The accuracy 😂
How bout dem Niners! The real America's Team! Did you see all that Red at Sofi and Jerry's World?
Accurate.  ~_~
Being a Cowboys fan is a rollercoaster of emotions and this video perfectly conveys our overall experience rooting for them
His dad was filming this, right?
so. How's Mike Macarthy for you? signed a packers fan of 13 years.
How bout them chockboys!!
That slim shit was killing me
BANG BANG NINER GANG
It's simple, Prescott isn't good enough,  can't get out the pocket, he throws to high or around the ankles, and unaware of the play around him, not in top 10 of QBs in the NFL.
I watched this video because I hate the Plowboys. I'm glad I did because that was funny shit 😂😂😂
Why you sound exactly like Tom Hanks at 4:44 😭😂😂
I felt this whole video. Damn heart attacks. Cowboy fans aren’t healthy and we don’t have good health insurance.
I cannot tell you the amount of joy I felt going onto social media after the game and just saying “HOW BOUT DEM COYBOYS” to salty Cowboy fans after the amount of shit they talked all year. They can dish it but sure can’t take it. 🤣
Greg the leg finally makes all his kicks...and yet we still lose.... Next year will be different just wait and see (hopefully >:) )
Scooter looks 45 in the thumbnail damn cowboys aged this poor man smh
Scoot Dawg ya wanna talk bout it? I’m here for you…
But was Sean Lee playing tho?
4 playoff wins in the last 25 years. Nothing more to say about the cowgirls. And before anyone says anything stupid about my birds they have 14 playoff wins in the same amount of time. This isnt the early 90s. Cowboys are trash and will never get to the big one. Especially with Dak "can't get it done" Prescott. Bum ass
Scooter is on another level with the comedy....😂😂😂💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Should be used to it by now.
As a 9ers fan I love the Cowboys tears!
Cowboy fan's always add that "We will get it next year" ever since the Troy Aikman era.
Is this what winning a Super Bowl looks like??? Then my Chargers have won 60 consecutive Super Bowls LES GO!!!!
I'm not a Cowboys fans, but I was saying the same stuff at the TV...very funny, now I know why my wife gives me the crossed eyed look during the games.
Love you man...love these videos you make...A real fan of the sport....I know how you feel I am A Vikings Fan...lol
Nothing, and I mean nothing makes my heart as happy as seeing all of the arrogant and shit talking cowboys fans eat it every year. Every year y'all talk so much shit and every year you don't make the playoffs or are out 1st game. Id say maybe you would learn some humility but let's be honest, its not going to happen.
Most talent ? Lol no
😂
Brooo that music have me 💀💀💀
I was waiting for this video and you did not disappoint
I was 17 the last time they won the Super Bowl, this is hurting alot.
Bwhahahahahahahahahaha
The cowboys lost because like every sport and wwe event, there are writers that store storylines during the off season. So they write ideas to give cowboys fans hope, then comes the evil 49ers to take it all away then the bucks beat the 49ers in the superbowl. It's all pre written. Im mike and I approve that message. Paid for by common sense
It still hurts… but I’m here for the scooter !!! 😂 go tsss tsssss cow huhhh hhhhhh boys 😭
Hanging their little trooper..🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
At least it was close. Could've been worse. My Cardinals got destroyed on Monday. It wasn't even close.  It was like the Bills, but in reverse. The bills scored every time they touched the ball. Cardinals didn't score until their *9th possession!*  This is after 5 punts , 2 ints ( 1 for a pick 6)  It was ugly.
Dallas sucks still look at you you borrow your mouth too much
4:53 🤣👌
I'm laughing but I'm crying
That last comment... "I'm done" ... is exactly how I feel
Let’s goooo 49ers 🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️🙌🏾🙌🏾🤞🏾🤞🏾
As a Life long Cowboys fan you are spot on😂
The final minute of the game felt like 2 seasons.
Love it.
Jesus the amount of energy output by this one man can power an entire city, and he is hilarious...... Salute!
lololol. damn cowgirls. GO BUCCS!!
I was laughing on my way home that night 😂😂😂 a Cowboys L makes the weekend so lit
Told y’all all year Cowboys weren’t good and we’re gonna be 1 and done🤷🏾‍♂️ played mediocre teams all year and wanna get hyped for nothing 💀
Was fun to watch the Cowboys choke again; whole NFC North knows McCarthy’s one of the worst coaches in the league and this team being about as disciplined as Bishop Sycamore is a direct reflection of that.    Jerry will never hire a strong enough coach because he still wants to run the team.
I only watched the highlights and was amazed at how many penalties the cowboys got and unless I blinked and missed it I didn't see the Niners penalized once. Sorry Cowboy fans but the betting Gods decided the niners have to win it's all about the money
The arrogance melting away to sorrow every year for nearly three decades is so satisfying.
Lol let’s talk about it buddy
4:52😆😭
Yeah that is how we felt but.... We know we weren't going to win. But you guys thought you were and that is worse... HAAHAAHAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Go Washington 😘
That game aged you.
Coldest part of this video is that he was 💯 percent accurate on how I was the whole fucking game! The worst playoff loss we had  (out of a whole lotta them) the one that hurt the most was when Romo couldn’t hold the ball for the field goal 🆚 Seattle. They all suck major ass but shit it hurts like trying to take a nasty 💩 while being constipated with 3 gnarly hemorrhoids!!!! 💀🔫⚰️🪦….. Still #DC4L tho!
YESSIR VANDER ESCH WITH THE TACKLE OF THE YEAR !🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺
My Brother in law is Light skin with An Afro just like that!! He went through all of the emotions  Just like that😁😁😁💪🏾💯
At 4:41, The fun begins.
Don’t worry cowboy fans you’ll win the Super Bowl next year 😂
You wrong you're team is garbage 🗑 😒 dallas cowgirls jajaja you talk to much and then you never chut up  so 🤷  be happy they  lost
As a 49ers   you ok with me even if u a Cowboy fan love the videos
You can see scooter is reallly sad !!! Poor scooter it’ll be alright they’ll come back stronger
It doesn’t even hurt anymore, it’s just expected.
Tough year brother!  Praying for you.
I live in peace knowing woody is a cowboy fan 😭
I know there were a lot of factors for why the Cowboys lost - including some poor coaching decisions and let downs by everyone - but the biggest reason for me was the very poor Offensive Line play. 49ers D had their way and took Dak out of his game too many times.
Life long Cowboys fan and grew up in Dallas. Before game I texted my Dad "24-13 Niners, Dak struggles and too many penalties". The only thing I got wrong was five points. SMH.
BANG BANG NINER GANG! Loved seeing Dallas lose. HAHA
14 penalties sorry this is coaching, give to any coach who knows what he is doing Tomlin yes
Just be happy your team isn't the Chargers.
See you next season Scooter
You were great! You can have a career as an actor lol!!!!!
Yup...
You forgot to start crying at the 4 minute mark of the fourth quarter
you can come be a lions fan with me. u'll never be disappointed as we will never win. lol
"Packers fans were right about Mike McCarthy! THIS MAN GARBAGE!"
I can’t stop laughing 😂 😂😂 Then reality hits me that I’m a Browns fan… 😳🥺😢
I hate being a Cowboys fan sometimes. But I am for life, I won't go jump on a bandwagon like others... Somebody called the crying girl a Cowboys  bandwagon fan?!?!?? Wtf is the benefit in being a Cowboys fan? Somebody please enlighten me.
I really do love you Dallas Cowboy fan brother that was absolutely positively hilarious
Nobody call me for 24hours lol
As an Eagle fan my only give a F*** was that Dallas lost that day.
EVERYTHING I SAID EXACTLY EXCEPT  I SAID IM A GROWN WOMAN.
As a Giants Fan. The Cowboys bring me joy every year as they are always the Super Bowl Champs in July but are one and done in the playoffs every year.  This year was just extra joy with no wins.
Omg toooooo damn funny. 😂
Most talent in the league lol
Dem BOYZ will never topple an EMPIRE😎🤣
It’s very simple. THE COWGIRLS ARE OVERRATED! 😂😂
I actually felt bad as hell for my Momma and Scooter, both big fans..... I honestly felt bad even clicking on this video. Cannot miss a Scooter video tho! Out of respect, I waited 2 days.......
I’ve been waiting on this
"... I talked too much trash."  Think how Skip Bayless feels.   Hahahaha.
Great edits.  Great video.  Well done! ... Go Packers.
You def deserve 1 mil.
Do the Cowboys fans wanna talk about it?
What if we(Cowboys) tried to pick up Sean Payton, and did a 1 for 1 switch Prescott for Wilson????
They haven’t played a real team throughout the season. I can’t emphasize that enough. Week 1 with Tampa bay that’s it. Opening season doesn’t really count for me
As a 49ers fan, this video brought me so much joy
"We can't lose. I've talked too much trash on this"  Cowboys fans during every game
Dallas won as many playoff games a Philly...remember that this off-season.
It's all rigged you must remember football is classified as entertainment the same as wrestling and you know wrestling ain't real it's already been pre-ordained and they do this kind of stuff just to make you like the way that you were acting and to have a video like you got now and don't forget the bookies never lose Las Vegas never loses
Fly Eagles Fly!
PLEASE THIS WAS LITERALLY MY DAD 😭
Dak run.... and run out the clock
I am done! This is as good as they will be! Dak is not getting better. We will lose a lot of key players and coaches for his massive contract. Y'all enjoy an hour and a half of football and two hours of beer and car and propaganda commercials. There is no hope for them. Forget the coaches the players turn into diva's from all the publicity and attention put on the cowboys. No more. Absolutely not.
You need to find a better team. Cowboys have always been a joke
Parsons threw a punch and hit Aiuke in front of the ref and didn’t draw a flag let alone an ejection and the Cowboys are blaming the refs for the loss?
What do you Want!!! ?? Sorry Mom ..😂.. why you calling me ? Did y’all lose earlier ?🦅 suck Too .. Shut up !!!!
The game on Nickelodeon did look hype though haha
As an eagles fan, this game stopped me from having full on depression.
Another year. Damn I was a kid las time we won a Superbowl. Damn almost 40 now. Shit as always I say we got next year
Our Cowboys have to be the worst team at letting their fans down. It hurts just as much every season haha
''Jerry Jones you don't remember the last time you were this disappointed? I remember last season....EVERY SEASON'' 😂😂😂
Every emotion I had during the game was exemplified in this video. See ya next year bro… probably for more disappointments at the end
Welcome to being a browns fan but we will never see a super bowl ever
Now to see how my Packers will manage to choke against the niners. Tough break for Dallas though!
Yep, that's just who they are.
Ngl, life-long 'Boys fan, was expecting this loss.  The only playoff team we beat all year (outside of the Iggles, they don't count) was the Patriots who got ROCKED by Josh Allen and the Bills.  We're the exact opposite of the teams we were back in the 90's.  Those teams would have head-scratching losses to scrubs, but they always showed up for big games.  Nowadays we take care of business (usually) against the scrubs, but the bigger the lights, the more we fade.  Normally I'd expect the defense to be the 1/2 of the team to not show up to play, but it's generally been the offense that for whatever reason doesn't decide to bring their A-game.  Makes no sense.  If you're gonna make the most money, SHOW UP WHEN IT MATTERS.  Not impressed by Zeke or the WRs.  I think not having Gallup hurt more than anyone let on and he's undervalued.  Edit: Almost forgot.  F*** Mike McCarthy.  I didn't like the hire then, and I hate the hire even more after the loss on Sunday.  When we gonna hire a HC who isn't a bowl of cream-of-wheat-boring-ass-doormat?  Part of the reason why the team always seems to be incapable of winning big games is because they don't have coaches they believe in.  Cowboys are like a Royal Flush of Spades, expect instead of the Ace, they have a 2 of Hearts.
Efffff the cowboys!!! Delusion fans believe it’s their year every year. Franchise needs to stop selling that spoiled bill of goods. All that bragging in the regular season to be one and done.
Imagine the other team basically saying the Cowboys are ass from the get-go and can't hang with their physicality.....only to get beat the way they said they would beat them lmao
We’ll beat those niners for you boy.. Packer got your back… lol
i felt good about this game i really did but this team will snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory each and every time...nfl refs need better vetting to screen out prejudice towards teams...we need a new HC ...Guard/Center ... OC ... and kicker.   you said 2 very great truths... must be nice to have a competent kicker...and we have too much talent to be a 1 and done team...hang in there brother im a cowboy boomer since 73...i love you ..we love dem boys...our blood runs blue and silver...pro bowl and draft lets go!!
As a Giants fan.../ now I can enjoy the playoffs...😎👑
Those refs got out real quick! Lol
I love your channel when the Cowboys lose not as much otherwise
Broooooooo, I luv the video. Your awesome. I wish you could do one for every team in the playoffs. Lol
Cowboys receiver Wilson doesn't play every down when running play or ball not going to be thrown to him doesn't put mouth peice in puts mouth peice in when he plans on catching a ball if I can see it from my TV defense can notice it when lined up in front of him
After the triplets this crap happens to us every year 🥺
This dude corny asf
I bubble for joy when the KBoys lose!!
I say it every year the cowgirls will never 👀 a super bowl again oh wait on madden they can 😂😂😂
Cowboys doing cowboy things
Kudos to all Dallas Cowboys fans. First time in a long time after the Dallas Cowboys suffered an embarrassing, we didn't hear a single Dallas Cowboys fans mention.  "You know we're going to the Super Bowl next year right?"
Welcome to Bills life. Oh we love our boys, but until they win the Superbowl, we're jaded. Y'all would only have 1 ring in the 90s if you hadn't of played Buffalo twice...one and done😎 Good luck next year. 🇺🇸👍🇺🇸
As a Cowboys fan this was the worst playoff loss we have took.Smfh this right here is facts.Damn you mike and jerry 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤯🤬💯
As an Eagles fan, we have officially made the decision to save a spot on the couch for Cowboys fans. As long as there isnt TOO much fighting (if there is theres gotta be a good reason), we will allow you to have this seat next to us. After all, misery loves company.
Haha. You are so funny. Who have some much energy in your videos.😂.
Don't worry...y'all going to the Super Bowl...next year!!😂🤣😂😅
That was needed . A big fat L for the cowboys , the world is gone crazy but at least the cowboys are condistent .
We can’t lose, I’ve talked too much trash for that
They did lose to any other team till the 49er came to town 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hahahaha this dude cracked out he doing even call all the cheating part the cow boy did 🤣🤣
Go Niners!
Best YT vlog ever
Those damn officials. The officials cheated for the 49ers and on and on and on. LMFAO !! Cowboy fans are always talking smack and as usual they can never be good sports at the end of a game. Its always someone else's fault. Whats even worse is that fans were throwing bottles and trash at the officials and Prescott gave them props. I had respect for Prescott up until that point. Now, Prescott can take his place in the "Whiner All of Fame"
At least your team didn't finally make it to the Super Bowl, get up 28-3 @ half...and then proceed to lose the game 😭. #RiseUp 😢🙏🏾✊🏾
Gregory was so frustrated he tackled a guy blocking him, if only he and the others could tackle Deebo like that they would be advancing instead.
As long as J.J keeps interfering with the team,rinse and repeat losing. Stop blaming the team, remember when we had a coach, who ran the whole team,we we where winning
Cowboy tears 🤣🤣🤣
Best game I ever went to! First time seeing my Niners win. 3rd time is the charm. And against the Cowgirls;) playoffs baby LOL
Youngster, born and raised in San Francisco and being a fan since 1956 (10 yrs old) up until even this day I'm going to give you what I now do regarding watching the niners play, I RECORD, if they lose I delete if they win I watch it. My body heart and mind thanks me for doing as I do not EVER get upset anymore watching. You have to embrace the positive things in life and let the negatives go.
I love watching Cowboys fans cry. 😂. Niners own the Cowboys
As a 49ers fan I had about 3 heart attacks in the final 5 minutes alone…great video, made me laugh
must be nice to have a confident kicker 🤣😅 as VIKINGS WE KNOW THIS FACT
BANG BANG NINER GANG!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro said a Chris tucker movie 😂 had to be a light skinned but it’s actually a cube film bro
Tell next year lol I know your pain I'm a pats fan. We got slaughtered but man I'd be livid if Mac did what Dac did. A chance to win damn
Lmfao great video
"wait, they said Bosa might come back...what?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #FUCKINGDEAD
Eagles, we was just happy to be there…. #NoExpectations
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I saw I wasn't the only one who watched the game on Nickelodeon...it's actually a good way to watch games with the kids. Love them pretending like Emmitt Smith knew he was getting slimed...
Chefs kiss
I want the Cowboys to win strictly for Scooter, he deserves it
2:07 😂😂😂
Has an NFL game ever ended like that before? I’ve seen college teams do it but never at the professional level
I'm so fxxking hurt. But I'm hopeful that we might get a ring in the next 5 years. 😪
Its like poetry it rhymes.
I love the moonlight sonata in the back ground...
You right, we garbage tooo🤣🤣!!! Fly eagles fly
I’m pretty unbiased as far as the Cowboys go.  I like to see em succeed but i also enjoy the salty tears of their fan base too! The theatrics always gets me lol.
No ''wait till next year''? Huh
Omg, you were great! You need to be in a real show!
😅😅😅😅😅
🅿️
Cowgalssss😂😂😂😂
why is this accurate af
Can't wait to see yourself get dunked on by Tom Grossi, UrinatingTree, Brandon Perna, and FivePoints in Clickbait this Thursday, Scooter.  Also, HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS??!!!!
Boy that was my reaction as well sht
This was both hilarious and sad to me. As a NJ Giants fan I love to see the "Dem Boys" lose in such specular fashion, however as a NJG fan at least the Cowboys actually made it to A wildcard game can't say that about "Big Blue" balls who only made it to one wildcard game in 2016 and missed every playoff game since their 2011 SB win.😒      Still funny AF tho🤣🤣🤣😉
Niners
Great performance by You! I saw those plays in my minds eye as I went through the emotional rollercaster with you.
as a Niners fan, this made me laugh
Only only the Cow chickens could mess up get dominated try to cheat and then cry about it ....you have to LOL
I felt this more than any other video.
Not a cowboys fan but I like it very funny
Cedrick Wilson smh 🤦‍♂️ 😂
Yeah, this one hurt.
Sigh. Alright, I guess the pain is numb enough to watch this now..
They did miss a hold on parsons !! Lol
I think the officials threw a flag after the game ended just because.
The  49ers took the opening kickoff & drove 75 yards for a TD & led the whole game. No reason for cowboy fans to think their team would win. That's on you!
I know exactly how you feel bro. I'm a Seahawks fan and we go through this one and done thing every single year for thr past 5 years except this year we missed the playoff. 😢 Go Hawks!
Who do the Cowboys play next week?
The Greatest Fan Meltdown in NFL History!
This was a painful loss but I still trying to run through my mind why we ran a qb draw with less than 15 seconds left with 0 timeouts
On POINT.  SMDH til next year 🤦🏽
Whoop! Whoop! Cowboys Lose like usual! They always choke, That is the Number One rule of being a fan of The Dallas Cowboys! Go 49ers.
That confident kicker line took me out
AMAZING!!! This man is a genius.
We cant lose - I talked too much trash for this
Bruh u be having me weak!!!! LOL
You could always be a chargers fan lol
Loved watching Dallas lose.
ScooterMagruder presents Skipp Bayless during the game.
They're called the 49'ers because they can't make it past the 50 yard line
How about them cowboys
How bout them cowboys 😂😂😂 #chiefnation
Nobody contact me for 24 hours. LOL.
🤣🤣🤣 BANG BANG 9ER GANG
It hurts! Year after year after year another let down!  How much more can we take?  On the other hand,  I gotta say I love this video!  Totally how I was feeling!
Dak 200,000,000 hahahaha
Jerry Jones will probably never see the cowboys win another super bowl ever again:(
Typical Cowboys season. Overhyped  and underperformed.
😂😂😂
LOL i was waiting for this....Cowboys fans do you need to talk?
Colin Kaepernick has won more playoff games in the last 25 years than the Dallas Cowboys.
Lmao that was so me when they played lol
At least you ain’t trying to blame the refs like some fans
All the Cowboys can do, is Cowboy. Fuckin clowns & clown fanbase
i loved every bit of it.
The Cowboys played sloppy the entire game - missed assignments and a whole lotta penalties.  They lost this game more than SF won it.  The refs didn't facilitate the kill shot; they were the kill shot.
You know what, this video was pretty sad and I was gonna give you some sympathy but hahaha haha ha hahaha the cowboys lost hahahaha haha ha ha hahaha haha they suck hahahaha
"I hope he feels better, after the game" you are the truth
As a Washington fan your misery is my comfort
U lost tho fuck the cowgirls lol
😔
That ending....I teared up.
Funny thing is Mike is clear on this... this is all Dak's fault 100% lol.
That quiet, dejected, defeated, exhausted "I'm done" at the end is what finally got me to laugh One day Scooter, one day the Cowboys might win a playoff game
We packers fans told you McCarthy was garbage. But you thought y’all had a great coach.
Thanks for making the pain slightly easier to bear...
One and done, is that all we are!?!  Somewhere a Lions fan dreams of such lofty heights.
I get a kick of how he watches the game on tv and on the laptop lol
Those refs got carpel tunnel from throwing so many flags.
That is the most perfect video from a fan’s standpoint that I have ever seen!  Pure Gold!
"Will I ever see another super bowl in my lifetime?"  "What's a super bowl?" - every Lions fan ever...
The Cowboys have 4 playoff wins since 95.  (4-11)  In that same period Pittsburgh has 17, New England has 33, Green Bay has 19 Seattle has 14, Philly has 14, NYG have 10, Jacksonville has 7, and Carolina has 9 just to name a few.  The only teams with less playoff wins since 1995 is Detroit, Washington, Buffalo (currently at 3, but could tie with a win this week), Miami, Cincy, Cleveland, and Chicago.  That's pathetic.
Exactly how I feel!!!
Cowboys are so bad
Lol go eagles
Come draft time we’ll see the Cowboy fans reemerge from their depression.
If you haven't figured it out yet as to why the Cowboys can't get it done then I will give you a hint... the initials are J and J.
You really kill it with these videos. So relatable!
Be happy you even made the playoffs
We all share your pain. I actually gave up after the Cedric Wilson missed catch, then saw we got the ball back only to watch Dak run out of time. To be honest this one for me doesn't sting as bad as Dez's catch reversal, but it still bites.
Greatest video ever!!
Well don’t be sad my blow out as a phi fan 35-15 the refs where dumb
5:53 hits hard.
Damn bro i been watching ur videos ever since I found u on here.. Definatly congrats on ur progress and also YOUR TRENDING !!
What a great video
LOL HAHAHAHAHA Go Nineeerrrssss ¡¡¡¡
Imagine being a Cowboy and Longhorns fan. I feel like it's pointless for me to even watch if it's considered to be a big game
U are the problem with that jersey, DAK SUCKS
As a Packer... Yup! F*** Mike! Terrible!!!
That face looking at the computer 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂. That was me too!
YALL STILL DEMBOYZ BUT YALL AINT MAKING NO PLAYOFF NOISE
💔💀🏈
And not 1 sack by the Cowboys the entire game - sheesh!!
whats the name of that sad music, i know it! but can't remember the name GRRR. # Mike needs to GOOOOOOO
"The most talent in the league" is when I finally laughed at this video.  Not even close bud.  Learn the game.
Hey I think next year is the boy’s year
Can someone tell me why the clock didn’t stop while they re set the chains…
THE ACCURACY
Gregory was killing you
Dak sucks bottom line
I don't remember being this upset at a loss in a long time...
Cowboys - the most overhyped consistently  mediocre team ever. Their cult gets let down every season
😂
"Why do I give so much time of my LIFE!!??"  I'll be back next season.  *sigh*
I knew it. As soon as I saw how that game ended, I KNEW this video was gonna be gold!!   Dak!! LET THE REF TOUCH THE BALL, MAN!!
That quiet, dejected, defeated, exhausted "I'm done" at the end is what finally got me to laugh One day Scooter, one day the Cowboys might win a playoff game
"Cowboys to Super Bo- wait what. we- we lost to the 49ers?" RIP Scooters dignity
It was actually painful to watch this. It brought back all the pain that I thought I had healed from. Too soon.. Too soon.  But I caught that, "sorry mom." That was priceless.  The ending... I felt that too. I still feel it, right here.. sniff sniff..
Man you had me waiting for this 🤣🤣🤣🤣 y'all suck
Hey scooter, do you wanna talk about it?
They make me sad sometimes but they're still my boys!
Pretty funny but this spot on how fans react 🤣
At this point.. as an eagles fan I hope y’all can at least make it to the NFC championship game man… and I only say that because we just got a ring 4 years ago so I know what it’s like..  I actually feel bad for y’all at this point lol it’s almost like making fun of someone with a disability.. it’s just not cool bro
Yo know it's bad when you start with the sad piano music lol. You usually build to that. Reactions was on point though as usual
Refs were like let’s exercise our hands and throw a flag
do you want to talk about it....;)
Dude, as a diehard Cowboys fan from way back, this loss, and every other loss, kicked my ass. I have to say after watching this video and laughing my ass off, I actually feel better. Thanks. You should be in movies. Great stuff.
You should have included the phone call from Grossi right after the game.
Another year. God damnit.
As an Eagles fan I literally spat my water out as soon as he said:  “Is this how Eagles fans felt earlier? Cause this is getting ridiculous!” 🤣😂🤣😂🤣.  Bruh. Im still dying! Bahaahahaha
I try to see how far I can get before I get depressed
As has been said many times before and will in the foreseeable future..."HOW 'BOUT DEM COWGIRLS?" Just think..."Feeble Jerry" gave Dak $75 MILLION! ROFLMAO! :)
This really funny! 🙂
“will i ever see another super bowl in my life?!” yeah as a cardinals fan I feel you
Dak has reach his cell .  5 years of suck for over paying this clown.   The fan morning show that your boy !!
Every.  Year!
Ad an eagles fans definitely called every cowboys fan. "Yeah we lost too but we only expected to make the wild card sooooo we met our expectations how bout yall"
It's just a little karma from when you beat up on the eagles 7-string football team and we're proud about it
Awwwwwww 😂😂😂😂😂
Can someone explain what #85 was doing after the QB draw? Dude looked like he needed a map for a second. LMAO
Those last few seconds of this video.... that was really real.
I haven't watched a scooter video all season but damn the boys made you age like 10yrs in one season lmao
😂😂😂 now this was hilarious. I the words of Katt Williams..."you shouldn't have been talking shit" so happy when they got eliminated I almost cried
Cookie 🍪
After Wilson dropped the pass on the 4th and 11 I immediately turned off the game. I knew damn well they weren't coming back. Its frustrating.  I was young and watch in real time the cowboys win those superbowls in the 90s. I was ecstatic then. Man I miss that feeling.
Man, poor old jerry Jones probably won’t be with us anymore, by the time they win a playoff get. Let alone reach the big game.
I am concerned  for this gentleman
Yo, this loss cut deep!!  I got teary eyed the last minute and a half of this video!!  But I’m still here! #DC4L Comment : 1-18-22
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤ ✝️
This seems correct lol
We’ll see you Thursday!
The ending is perfect.  It's how my son and I feel that same way at the end of each season.
WHAT DO YOU WANT!!?? …….I’m sorry mom…
I felt this to my core all the way through
HOW ABOUT DEM COWBOYS!!!!
Cowboys did end the game🤣🤣🤣🤣
literally saw the pain in his eyes 😭😭😭
It's hilarious housepot on you are the one that got me was I've given so much time of my life for this haha haha hahaha LMAOI yelled that phrase over and over for about 5 minutes after the game
Classic
Why didn't they cut McCarthy
I felt this i cried like I was watching this game  all over again. 😭😭😭
Scooter marguber the cowboys are going to make it to the super bowl don’t worry
At least your not a Giants fan🙃
I like the Cowboys that football team  is what I like
😭😭😭😭😭
And we still can't fire McCarthy and get a better head coach!!!
Why are these videos so much more hilarious when the Cowboys lose.
I had a dream the cowboys won the super bowl and then woke up and immediately started laughing.
Dallas doesn’t know how the Eagles feel because Eagles got bs penalties, Dallas actually committed the penalties
"I talked too much trash for this" lmao
Eagles have 3 first round picks and have won a SUPERBOWL in the past 20 years…… HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS
People actually think pro football is real😂😂😂😂☺️😂
Well deserved for the trashiest fan base out there
I love the sad music throughout. 😂😭
Should of got the turnover with 2 mins on the clock.. protect Prescott.
talk too much trash got me this year as a Gator Fan...i became very quiet after the 2nd loss... bag on my head after 4th loss...There is always NEXT YEAR BABY!
I am SO done for watching the cowboys game, I had watching the for five seasons, from now on I watch formula 1 for the rest of the season.🏎️🏁 In conclusion I'm quitting watching football.
Despite the Eagles losing. This game was glorious for me
Congratulations 🎈🎉🍾🎊, you’re trending on YouTube at #13.
Doesn't matter how well they do in the regular season. NEVER EVER GET YOUR HOPES UP UNTIL THEY CAN FINALLY WIN A PLAYOFF GAME!
Only an eagles fan can take solace in dallas losing after they laid a larger egg in Tampa. Such class. I guess at least cowboys had a shot up to the final "clock it" play. Eagles were done at the coin toss.
I feel your pain Scooter.
"It's the playoffs, come on." Clearly they knew Scooter, why else would they be choking so hard.
Bruh, you da best! Makes us laugh after ANOTHER Cowboy collapse. We are returning to the "Next Year's Champs" the Boys were titled back in the 70's.
"WHAT DO YOU WANT?.... Oh hi mom." Lmao 🤣
New drinking game - take a shot when Scooter says "what are we doing?"
Scooter it's Fernando where is your gorgeous  girlfriend  she helps when the cowboys loose🥰
At this point Jerry Jones might as well march onto the field and act as head coach. He’s already GM and every other position in the organization. I swear the Jones family is the worst thing to happen to the cowboys.
Man I've been waiting for this and it did not disappoint!!!
The Im done at the end was me.
😂
PRICELESS!!!
Yoo. This just made me a lil sad 😂 til next year….go Cowboys 🤠
Dude how do you have a voice left after these? Very funny video!
Right there with ya brother. It’s so hard.
The only thing that made me sad about this video is that there’s no more cowboy rage videos till next season😢
Get rid of McCarthy, Philbin, Bones, and whoever the QB coach is.
Perfect music.
THAT WAS ME FROM BEGINNING TO END!  OMG!!  I'm still dumbfounded!!
Bro I swear I’m so done with being a cowboys fan but It’s too much invested at this point so I’m really just lost
I've put off watching this but I have to rip off the band-aid and deal with my feelings.
As a niners fan I was sweating towards the end
How bout dem Cowboys....wwoooooooo lol
This was funny lol
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Mccarthy is still a stinky feet cheese head and wants us to loose.
Awww scooter. I’m a 49ers fan, but after watching this video I feel bad for you 😭. You’ll get them next year bud
BOY DO I WISH TONY WAS STILL OUR QB,ITS OBVIOUS DAK IS NOT THE GUY..SORRY NOT SORRY
the background music lol
Too soon.
Was so hoping to see a tweet from Aaron Rodgers when the Cowboys kicked that field goal. 🤣
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Great job with this! At times, I was reminded a lot of Keegan Michael Key, and I mean that as a very high compliment.
Ceedee got locked down.
Did Sean Lee play?
Ayy my niners won
Sorryass team
I enjoy your suffering. 😈
Sorry bro
Ya trash go niners
Actually they had picked off jimmy g
Ahhhh that sweet smell of Defeat. Your cowgirls are never going back to the super bowl with a Jones owning the team. And yes my team got knocked out and probably shouldn’t been invited to the playoffs but at least I don’t need a VCR or Betamax to watch my last championship.  FLY EAGLES FLY
i cried dead ass
Bruh... I am going to find the camera you put IN MY HOUSE. Legit, word for damn word, AGAIN!
I really just almost died for nothing 😂😂😂😂
Maybe you wouldn’t be disappointed if the team wasn’t overhyped every year with unreal expectations
What I told you ! Don't count us out
When the video already starts with sad music lmao
On freaking point!
The pain you feel is the pain a giants fan feels every week. ✌🏻 Go blue
Moonlight Sonata playing in the background really sets the mood
That. Was. Genius. 😂
Cowboy fan 😭😭😭😭😭
Great dialogue!!! If you watched any of the press conferences... It seems like the game means more to the fans than it does to the players. The Eagles played like a JV team (mistakes).
The refs threw another flag this morning.  Can’t be too safe, they said. I was so shocked that I dropped my boxers and the ref ‘adjusted’ it for me. I mean he took his time and all but he had to get it just right… or maybe a little to the left….take your time…. Yes. That’s just right. 😋
And now we wait for the click bait stream
“I’ve talked too much trash for this” 🤣🤣🤣
https://youtu.be/3tyOVnOXGxw
ScooterMagruder are you a Cowboys fan? I can see that you made a lot of videos in your channel that have the Cowboys in them
🤣🤣🤣 thoughts and prayers
The accuracy of it being an Eagles fan calling after the loss. This is my favorite Cowboys fan an that coming from an Eagles fan.
“I’m sorry Mom”
dey cheated us
The sad music right off the bat...........yep............😑
Hire Dan Quinn as head coach
Everyone who thinks that the reff was in daks way knows nothing about football. You were in his way to spot the ball dummies. And even if you snapped the ball with 1 second left you would have been flagged for half of your oline was still past the ball. Lol you just suck. Own it
The Nickelodeon Comment LOL
The OLINE is past it’s prime. Zeke playing through a partial PCL tear is valiant but it was unwise to have him play at all. So to me the OLINE and running game were issues down the stretch. The defense vastly improved but we need DLINE help maybe a safety.
We are winning the super bowl. Next year.
The music 🤣😂
I forgot about you @scootermacgrauder stephen a smith  played his favourite accident waiting to happen song.
Love the video.  I remember been like that. My wife thinks im crazy.lol i tell her. Is the love of the game.
Nice but don’t feel bad 49 ers fans are as delusional as cowboys fans thinking they are going to Mr Rogers neighborhood and beating them there with big injuries and question marks even though they got beat this year at home.  But hey you never know especially this year 👍👍
"I almost just died for nothing?" I'm DEAD over here tho!!
I wish scooter mentioned all the fans crying that they kept showing I couldn't stop laughing when they kept showing them cause you know they were all probably hammered lol
Either you're a fan, or you know many!😂😂😂 I went thru all of it!😂😂😂😂😂
Packers fans on McCarthy: “Reality is often disappointing”
Masterpiece! Sorry for your loss 🙏
I feel ya man .
Did we just end the game on a clocked ball?  ---that question bears repeating: DID WE JUST END THE GAME ON A CLOCKED BALL!?!?
😂😂😂😂😂
Don’t talk bout My Eagles no more lmfao
As an Eagles fan... We were just happy to make the playoffs!!! We knew we weren't winning
Dem boys garbage
“I’m sorry mom” 😂
Credit to Scooter for not complaining about the ref on the last play.
His pain was real.... lol
LOL but here's the difference between the Eagles & the Cowboys losing.  Everybody including Philly themselves knew the Eagles Know the Eagles was going to lose, hell everybody was shocked they even made it to the playoffs in a rebuilding season where they were supposed to have 4 wins, so if anything them even making it to the playoffs was a positive  The cowboys on the other hand, you have an amazing roster, led the NFL in points & yards from the offensive side, you had all that great talent only for you to get knocked out of the first round, from a bum 49ers team, at least the birds lost to a good team like Tom Brady & Tampa, & nobody in Philly is crying except Dallas which makes it more funnier 😆
As a Saints fan, this hit WAY TOO real
Wanna talk about it?
This perfectly encapsulates the ebb and flow of emotions that football pulls out of us fans. 😅 it’s exhausting yet so satisfying when you win, but poor luck for the Cowboys. A lot teams got exposed for not be able to covert 3rd downs and make key critical plays.
You wanna talk about it, scooter?
I told you this will happen to the Cowboys so I have to say HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS
Next week scooter: “Dak prescott for 2023  MVP”
Loved it
How bout them cowboys!
Dont worry dem boys gonna go 16-0 next year but lose in the first round anyway because they choke every year Lmaolol
This is his Joker origin story
Everyone here just for the ending 😂💯
I almost didn't watch this I'm so sick of hearing about this game
I love you scoots. You're  hilarious
I sent this to EVERY Cowboy fan I know 😂
Fly eagles fly.
23:59 - Samuel Deebo who? 00:00 - Of course. Of course is Samuel scoring again.  Maaaan am I glad Deebo is on my team, I wouldn't want to play against him
Just be happy your not Houston. God sure hates that city.
PENALTIES, PENALTIES, PENALTIES > Self inflicted LOSS 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
Wooowww!! Poor Cowboys but Love your content🔥🔥🔥 I’m trying to get my subscribers up too 💯 keep it up ❤️
Fun fact, had our OC not called a play up the middle to Wilson into the sun, we could of kicked a fieldgoal.  Then the last drive we just needed to be in fieldgoal range to tie it up
I really almost died for nothing.  Story of our lives rooting for this team
Hahahaha
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS!!!😂😂😂
Is it good to see my favorite YouTuber is okay I thought we might have to do a welfare check after Sunday
The hysteria,,, is deserved! I still can't believe that game happened!! Hang in there Scooter.
2:21 ahahah had me rolling "are we goona lose?"
The painting of the cable car says it all
🤣🤣🤣🤣big L
When you need a timeout so bad but your coach wastes it before the last two minute mark.
I feel you man
15 yard run for 1 yard 🤣🤣🤣
glad the cowboys got Mccarthy.. is so brutal having him as a coach for the packers.. i remember those feelings like why?.. i feel your pain cowboy fans lol!
My Eagles weren't supposed to be anywhere near the playoffs this year, so that is what it is. But yall Cowgirls 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🐈‍⬛
Didn’t y’all(eagles) lose earlier ? Why are you calling me ? 😹
The Cowboys are exactly like this channel, used to be good, now overhyped trash
NINERS ❤️💛
Dak = overrated Zeke = past his prime
Never liked Cowboys going back to Danny White, Bill Bates. But, credit they keep trying, Dak came back from major injury. Think John Madden used to say ' must win turnover battle in playoff games, like 1 turnover, at most ; same, can now be applied to penalties. 14, just too many, like Raiders games of past. Just ,cut that 14, in half. ?  9ers pressure on Dak, was impressive,  though, even without  Bosa, 2nd half, etc.  Get down to business,  instead of Celebrating,  every little first down, or interception,  like you just made the Greatest play ever.  ?
Parsons doesn't get held every play get outta here lol excuses even from this dude
Unfortunately, Scooter, our fate is sealed. The Cowboys will never win a trophy again while the franchise is in the hands of the Jones family.  It's our curse.
An an eagles fan let’s just say my pain was short lived
I love when a cowboys fans say the Eagles suck. Yea y'all did all that jus to be one and done like the Eagles. Eagles wasn't even suppose to be in playoffs. Y'all was Superbowl or bust 😂😂😂😂
As a niner fan and a viewer of you I have been WAITING for this video 😂😂😅
What makes it worst is that the cardinals lost (WHATS EVEN THE POINT OF WATCHING THE REST OF THE PLAYOFFS)
This was pain.
Too many penalties (don't hog tackle people who don't even have the damn ball). Not enough defensive turnovers. Too many offensive 3&outs.  Things I am actually annoyed by: The ref that caused a delay of game penalty on us by standing in the o-line talking, while everyone was set. The same ref being late to touch the ball at the end, moved the ball from where it was and then placed it back where it originally was for no reason. Touch it and move, dude. The officials at the end saying game over after 3 seconds with no review and sprinting off the field like it was preseason and not a playoff game with potential interference on the play.  We should have played better. No reason it should have been that close, let alone a loss.  There is a version of Dallas that won 12 games, and a version that lost 5. This game was played by the Lost 5 version.
this was exactly me
💜this!!! You got everything right. All the emotions and disappointment during and after the lost opportunity of winning the game.😓🤦🏽‍♀️
This is good tv! The rivalry is back Seattle niner faithful
This team needs discipline so bad.  Another wasted season.  😔
We need to replace Wak prescott if we ever wanna do anything more than this. He does not do well under pressure you can tell against shitty teams he plays great but if a team has any kind of decent defense he crumbles and starts under and over throwing receivers and holding the ball to long and doing dumb shit like running the ball up the middle with 14 seconds and no time outs knowing the refs have to spot the ball. High school football teams would know better than that at the end of the game.
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS
as a niner fan, i loved your misery...great!
The music is perfect lol
What I wanna know is, how is the ref? Is he in hiding, or?
The spokesman for my soul. I know you do this for humor but the only ones who are really laughing is the haters. The video that still hurts me is when we went against the Packers with Dak (for his rookie year). It was a beautiful season we all didn’t see coming, so many disappointments, so many playoff appearances and I’m tired tbh
So the kicker should up witch is what thought would be the lose for use never saw this coming don’t talk to me for like a week. So many 49er fans I know looking for me
Dallas is only a good regular season team. They always do good in the regular season and always lose in the playoffs being a one and done.
So here's the deal with this franchise, there are a lot of great players on this team and Dak Prescott is a solid good quarterback, but he is not Aaron Rodgers and he is not Tom Brady so you need to build a strong defense around him and you've got to give him some good offensive lineman for him to succeed. Yet at the same time Prescott needs to learn to trust his receivers. Now who's the real problem with this franchise, it's Jerry Jones. Jerry has selected the wrong coaches to coach this team, yeah I get it he hired Mike McCarthy, McCarthy has experience but McCarthy the game has left him behind hes washed up kellin Moore has no business being on this team if you want to succeed you need to get rid of these coaches enough is enough wake up Jerry Your years are ticking away and you will never win again until you realize that you need professionals to coach this team.
Once again DAL can't beat a decent team!!!
To my fellow Dallas fans let this sink in...Only two QB's make more money than Dak Prescott.  Mahomes and Allen.  Both of them destroyed their opponents.  This is what we get from a QB making that much.  As a fan base please understand it is not the refs or the other teams that beat us.  It is bad coaching, lack of discipline and the pressure of trying not to lose as opposed to playing to win.   On paper the Cowboys are SB caliber year after year but in reality until they learn to play FOR one another they will always be...well...this
Wanna watch the Cowboys not suck in the playoffs? Better fire up your VCR (or YouTube I guess.)
Peak comedy
Didnt your momma teach you the Californias are trying to invade Texas?
Ahh man that was great! 😂😂😂
Havent heard so much whining since…………1981
"WHAT DO U WANT?! ....sorry mom" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As an Eagles fan, this brings a smile to my face
His emotions during the game be like:📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📈📉📉📉📉📉
youll be back next season, with this amazing content...... THEY STILL WILL LET YOU DOWN GO EAGLES!!!! LOL
Brruuhh im in tears 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Idk about other cowboys fans that are younger but I have only known disappointment from this team. I’m at the point now where I’m just rooting for Brady so that he will retire soon
Loved this!
What is ScooterMagruder's favourite team?
I feel like we need to credit the Bryan Anger, great punts keeping the 49ers backed up, and that clutch 4th down trick play. Just the defense couldn’t always capitalize
The cowboys are so garbage. So no more predictions that quick
Sorry magruder i'm a Cowboys fan two! I don't know if the Cowboys will ever win a super bowl even if were good enough..
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
WHAT DO YOU WANT!!!!!! of sorry mom🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Make my day
FIRE McCARTHY
Ur misery means this sort can get better
Can we change their name next season to the foulboys?
The level of talent they have is unreal...and yet they cant even win a playoff game.  Is this the new normal for Cowboy fans?  It might be.  Strange play calls, penalties galore, a lack of time management skills.  I have no words for this epic failure.  However, im not surprised.  WE have seen it this year in many games.  There is some serious fixing they need to do for next year, if we want to go to the Big Dance, but will it happen is what im wondering.  WE also need to get Zeke healthy, so he can be the beast of old.  He did the best he could with that knee, but lets hope it heals properly.  Until then, all we can do is watch the other teams and sit from the sideline again.  God Bless Scooter!
Best part about being a Cowboys fan...😩 ScooterMaGruder..🙃😞
🤣🤣🤣
Go Eagles 🦅🦅🦅
Hoe Bout Dem Cowboys!!!
I must say you is make my day with these cowboys videos lol thanks hope next season b better for y'all but you know y'all dem one and done boys in the playoffs
This encapsulated my feelings perfectly. No one else at the place where I was watching it was a cowboys fan, and they made fun of me constantly. Why can’t we just win?
SCOOTER COME ON MAN!!! DAK played WAK. The media begged for us to pay him like an elite player (because he could win these games, smh). His decision making looked no better than wintz, cousins, and jimmy gs on Sunday and for the better part of the season. The qbs lister are more accurate and throw a better ball than Dak.  So what does that say about Dak and our long term investment in him..
He said, " I talked too much shit for this"! 🤣
The fact Rodgers put up great numbers, running McCarthy's shit offense, shows you how amazing 12 is.
If Mike McCarthy is that bad I hope Jerry Jones keeps him.
Super Bowl baby! 😂😂😂😂😂
That was me Sunday night. Wtf
Just gotta look towards next year and do it all over again
At this point my mom knows better than to call me after my team loses.
Thanks for the great season scooter I’ll see you next year this one’s going to hurt me for a while just like every year
I must be the only Cowboy fan in Dallas that picked them to lose. That loss to AZ confirmed what I already suspected. They were frauds. 1-5 vs top 10 scoring defenses, which SF has, 23rd in rush yds given up per attempt, with SF being 7th in yds per attempt. The stats were right there & no one listened. They didn't beat a 10 win team all year. Jerry Jones & his family is the problem, & they'll NEVER win again with them in charge. They care about one thing. Money.
Well I woke up feeling better today than yesterday lmao
"WHAT!?!? Oh, hi mom" XD killed me~
This one wasn't even funny just depressing af.
It's like I'm watching myself
Da Boyz will be known as the One N done Boys!!!
I would root for the Cowboys vs some teams, I am a Seahawks fan and the 49ers are my most hated team...  Somehow I was indifferent in this result. I probably would of prefered the Cowboys to win but at the same time it's all the more sweeter if the 49ers lose deep in the playoffs like they did vs us in 2013 or recently with Garrapolo.   I guess my point is that somehow the Cowboys are so unlikable that somehow my most hated rival (the 49ers) were about 50% what I cared who won.  I wish I could leave you with some positive remarks but, I think the Seahawks have a better QB and more cap space and flexibility going into this off-season.  The Seahawks will probably blow it if they stick with Pete Carroll but at least they have a fighting chance or a punchers chance to make a splash, from my understanding the Cowboys are in trouble if they want to make any roster changes.  I was indifferent in this game BUT I LOST MY S*(% when they ran it in that situation and ran out of time LMFAO.
The Cowboys did not have the appropriate sense of urgency to score as needed to win. Also, halftime adjustments were non existent. They did not give up too many homerun plays but way too many penalties. The NFL needs to implement the clock stoppage after first downs for officials to get set.
Cowgirls 🤠
As a Niners fan this shit was hilarious! 🤣🤣🤣
that was the most rigged game ever lol the boys r bouta get the ball bac in the 4th and they cal a holding on gregrory even tho he was gettin ghold lol and parsons was unstoppable but they kept holding him lol
I can sum up the Cowboys loss in twofold manner.  First - 15 penalties.  Un-freaking-believable. But on an even worse note, Elliot and Pollard rush for a combined 45 yards.   Elliot got what, 20 yards if that.  The 80 million dollar man, rushing for 20 yards in a playoff  game.  Downright awful.  And don't get me started on Mike McCarthy.  My God, I didn't think it was possible to be a worse head coach than Jason Garrett.  I gotta tell ya.  Jerry Jones can really pick em.
Hey man. Come on over to Tampa.
I spent the entire video eagerly anticipating the reaction to the last play. It did not disappoint
Omg. 😂😂😂 A 1 and done team. 😂😂 killing me
Dallas deserved most of the penalties they received even though there were a couple that I thought were ticky-tack. But the no calls on Parsons being held throughout the game was infuriating. It happened multiple times right in front of the refs. Maybe they didn't call them because he's a rookie. A bullshit reason but who knows. I blame Jerry Jones, this team hasn't won shit since he's been, "the guy."  And no, 1995 doesn't count, that was Jimmy Johnson's team.
If I’m Jerry Jones I tell MM don’t let the door hit em on the way out and put the full court press on Brian Flores before he gets scooped up, I think he is literally a perfect fit for what this team needs more than anything: DISCIPLINE
You cowboys fans really bore me you're really bore me you activate this all started with Mike McCarthy it's Mike mccarthy's fault its  Is Dak Prescott the 75 million dollars garbage man fault,,, and it's damn sure Jerry Jones the owner's fault that the cowboys suck!!!! that's why I don't have a team I have a job and a life,,,, I'm a grown ass man!!!!!
ScooterMagruder will return..............as a Bucs fan
The “I’m done” at the end. That’s how it feels.
Join us on the couch Scooter. It is the NFC East’s destiny
Washington fans: First time?
I look forward to this video every year 🤣🤣🤣🤣 you should do a compilation of every last game of the year video
49er Empire to me look like the Cowboys were scared they know we was a tough opponent coming in the game what can I say don't try my 49ers like that Wii bowling
"Bosa's hurt?  I hope he feels better....after this game"
Why did Dak run 10 yards down the field, it was 4th and inches…
I'm a Washington fan but I love watching your videos, please come back and make videos for next season
I just saw another flag today...
Scooter lost weight
Bad call to run QB draw from the 40yd line with no timeouts. If you try that play 100 times a 100 times you will get the same result. Either the QB has no faith in his receivers or he has no faith in himself or he just doesn’t know football. Especially the rules.
Something is seriously going on with these refs.....
As a 49er fan.  I thoroughly enjoyed that.  Probably be me this week against the Packers
bad season might be coming ya way cowboy fans sorry to say it from a panther fan.
I was rooting for the 49ers, but I do feel bad for you, Scooter, and all the other Cowboys fans.  Sucks that there's really only one team with happy fans at the end of the season
I’ve been waiting for this!!!
The Cowboys are what happens if mediocrity was a person and owned a diamond chain.
Coaching was the main reason they lost. Lots of reasons, but that is the main one.
He said, "They got slime 👀?" Lmao
Turn out the lights the party's over......
The bottom line is the Cowboys are a dysfunctional organization. The team is soft and the players are divas.
The most ironic part of the whole game was that Zerlein didn't miss any kicks.
I like you too much to rub the salt in the wound. Everyone did try to tell Cowboys fans this was gonna happen but that’s beside the point 😂. I’d wish you better luck next season but I’d be lying if I did 😂😂
We all felt it to
Look, y’all most likely would have won. If y’all didn’t get us. Rams got lucky
Until Van Helsing stakes JJ in his coffin ⚰️ he will continue to suck the life out of the Cowboys with his bad decision making and arrogance.
When the sad music plays at the beginning of the video you know they were trash the entire game.
Cowbitches are the worst except this guy
As a lifelong cowboy fan since I was five years old who was born in 1960 the same year our boys were born, this year hurts maybe the most of all! I never thought something could hurt worse than the playoff game against the Packers were Dez caught the ball and that might’ve been our year for Romo to finally get a ring and Whittan. But this year hurts even more than that perhaps because it’s been so long and we had such a great promise on both sides of the ball! Terrible head-coaching the lack of discipline killed us all season! Great video brother I have enjoyed everyone every week this season next week yours inspired it made me laugh and made me cry! Just like our Cowboys! Keep the faith dude that’s what we do. We have the very best owner in the league and the very worst general manager in the same person! Did definition of insanity is to continue to do the same thing in the same way and to expect a different result. So I like to say if you want when you’ve never had… You’ve got to do what you’ve never done!  So maybe Jerry will wake up this year but either way we are fans we are cowboy fanatics we will always live to fight another day! Happy new year scooter and go cowboys!
Maybe because outside of the NFC (L)East, they were a 6-5 team.
#EVERYYEAR😂🤣☠️

I was waiting and was not disappointed. Thanks SM.
🤣🤣🤣
I love watching these after a Cowboys loss.
Thank you so much for this. As a life long cowboys fan this one stung so much. Not as much as romo in Seattle but almost as much...   Next year we are going to the super bowl!!!!!
I agree with every word 💯
It should have been Joe Buck and Troy aikman commented the 49ers and the cowboys ?  They should change their names to the Dallas choke boys 😭 l Jerry Jones should coach the cowboys because he seem like he wants to run the whole thing ! SO WHAT ABOUT THOSE COWBOYS ? THEY LOST AGAIN AT HOME !😭
"We can't lose.. I've talked too much trash" 😂
Praise to him for making this video for us after a tough loss🙏
They are pulling a McCarthy? Lmao
What do u want o sorry mom
I waited all year for this video. Looking forward to next year's. :D
The cowboys lost in the most cowboyish way to lose. If I told you that scenario without telling you the team you'd say it was the cowboys.
Blame Nickelodeon for the Loss.....hahahahahaah
LMFAO....
What's the bet that Scooter doesn't appear on Clickbait Sports this week?
🦅
🦅
Number 11 on the 49ers was holding all game.. Start with Parsons... They didn't call one
Are the Cowboys still going to the Superbowl or nah? Lol
Oooh you got that one of the nose lmao. Everything said they was me almost shed a tear. Why can't we win one damn in the playoffs
100% how I felt during the game. That was tough to relive. Once again, excellent work!
Dallas fans are like the refs made us lose na y’all just trash in the post season
The penalties is what killed us! That one drive with the fake punt killed me . I was losing my mind when the punt team was still on the field 😂
Lol my first thought was "I want my 60 hours back" from watching them this season
Don't tell your mama to shut up!
Poor coaching.  Underperforming Dak. Williams and Collins penalty machine.   Inept McCarthy
Jesse ,that is a true statement, cowboy fans talk a lot of trash 🗑️,and then when y'all loose the game 🏈. Then you get madd and start acting out. It's only a game, 🏈🏈🏈....
... hilarious...
Ive been a Dallas fan since I was 6 yrs old. I was 10 yrs old the last time Dallas won a super bowl. Now at 36, smh I feel like I’m going to have a heart attack just watching these🤬
This playoff loss hurt more than any other. More than the Romo fumbled field goal snap, which he picked up and scrambled attempting to score and was subsequently tackled short of the goal line. More than the Bryant catch that was not called a catch. Then reviewed from multiple angles and still called incomplete. Disappointed is an understatement. I’m disgusted with the Cowboys.  I’m done too Scooter. ✌🏿
The blank stare at 5:48...............
My 11yr old loves the cowboys lol he had all the same feels as you lol but we E.A.G.L.E.S!!! FANS IN MY HOUSEEEEEE But Dallas played a good game was very exciting
This is all football fans every week
I am Laughing  (and not "AT" him).... I am a niner fan  but I feel the pain for this guy .His animation and passion are remarkable. I'm worried that he watched the game alone    should have had a crew there to buffer the gridiron drama.His wish that Bosa  get well "after the game" a nice gesture.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Need more clapping!!! Lol
we cant lose. i talked too much trash... lol IM A GROWN MAN
I have been waiting for this video.
I feel bad for Scooter. Some of it was genuine sadness
Watching the Cowboys blow it made watching the Eagles get stomped hurt a little less.
🤣 the music.  Right away you know what's going down lol.
Every cowboy fan should've known on opening drive all I got to say.
The Jerry Jones effect. He should have retired after the 90s. 25 years and he still acts like they won last year. That sort of mentality is not good for a squad who has never been to 2nd or 3rd round of the playoffs. I’ve been watching Dallas since I was in diapers, and I can’t wait for Jerry to leave.
Did you see the rams game? I’m a cardinals fan. We did not play.
Dude who loses to garappulo?!!! Worst QB in the playoffs.
Use one word to describe that Cowboys game.  Penalties.🤣
Join the GB train bud!!!
Lionel  Ritchie!!!!!
God these videos are so accurate
I told on this page months ago that they was gonna lose in the playoffs lol
Y'know, every time I rely heavily on Cowboys to bring me to victory in betting pools, they decide not to be good. Had both Zeke and Pollard, and also Wilson. All 3 were on ice.  Thank you McCarthy for giving the backs the ball 6 times. Thanks Wilson for dropping that pass at the end of the game. And thank you Mahomes, Kelce, and Chiefs defense for picking up all their slack and then some.
“I talked too much trash for us to lose this game” 🤣
I feel like I was watching myself  in the mirror! @Scooter u r a genius
It's tough to win when almost every game we play the opponents and the goodellfellas dirty ass corrupt refs at the same time!
Look on the brightside....dak is making 40 million dollars going forward
I don't feel as bad now as an eagles fan IF ONE CANT MAKE IT NONE CAN MAKE IT
The Cowboys will forever be chokers
-Dak sucked, cowboys had way too many penalties, defensive QB pressure was non existent but that was probably due to 49ers designed quick offensive plays to counter that and because of this our coverage couldn't get into a rhythm. Zeke has been hurting for half the year, Pollard should be getting more touches. Collins needs to go back to LG, Connor Williams needs to walk to another team. Our receivers and pass protection do look worse because of the QB. Our run game also suffers when the defenses don't have a care in the world about the pass game.  I also feel too often the rams OL was getting away with as many penalties as we got flagged, constantly moving their heads and legs to bait our pass rush presnap. With Daks contract this was our year, things are only going to get worse for the next several years.   If this team is serious about being contenders with some of the young talent we have then we need to trade Dak before the draft and use whatever picks we can to grab QB, OL (C, RT), DL. Cooper is most likely gone since Daks contract takes up so much, Gallup may be gone but if he returns it won't be until later. That leaves us with CD who has been inconsistent. The last thing we need is to waste more high picks and dollars on OTHER receivers to protect Dak since he's a bottleneck to this offense. Zeke needs to get healthy and lose about 15 pounds, he needs to do whatever he can to return to rookie form/weight.
I’m so sad 😢😢😢 that the cowboys lost 😞
Scooter...  I look forward to you videos weekly sometimes more so than the game itself.  Your blank emotionless stare at the 5:45 mark is how I have been for 26 years...I am desensitized because if you are anything more than that you will lose your mind as a Cowboys fan.
I feel ya bro, I do. Such a waste of a season. I had to go to the shooting range afterwards!
Trade Dak
I've got 6 jerseys up for sale
Trade Dak, tried of Teddy Bridgewater Clone, Dak plays like garbage for 3.5 quarters, and then decides to play like a normal QB near the end of the 4th Quarter.
Dallas is trash Glad they proved how overrated they are
Ah, the catharsis of watching someone experience the same pain I did.
most talented team in the league 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Cowgirls fans are hilarious
We just look good on paper but play like trash. This was a bad matchup especially with their defense vs our horrible offense.
I dont think ill ever see a cowboys super before I die
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS?!?!?!
"Sorry, Mom..." 💀
cowboys IS SUCKS!!!🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂☺️☺️☺️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s okay Scooter:) Maybe in 5 years we can get these together…. still love my Cowboys…. They can’t help their owner is a brilliant businessman but a horrible GM….
It's like I'm looking in a mirror while watching the game everyweek.
Perfect.
This video is relatable
Cowboys are the new Maple Leafs
Tony Romo jink the cowboys ya T.o. Jinx my bulls at the Golden state game !
“WHAT DO U WANT!”  Sorry mom
If Causal Loop was a football team.
The only reason I dislike the cowboys is for the fans screaming WE'RE GOING TO THE SUPERBOWL from day 1 of the draft. Learn some humility cowboy fans and karma might actually be nice to you one year.
Maybe next year crybaby cowgirls
How you are not on prime time football channels is beyond me💕. Thank you so much for all the time and effort you put into your videos.  All NFL fans appreciate it!
Jerry made a deal with the devil to win Superbowl 30. This team is cursed.
Im done!
Eagles fans know how you feel.
At least you're not a Giants fan like me. I couldn't talk trash even if the coach was a garbage man. Giants Nation is at an all time low.
🤣😂
0:03 "The Cowboys Have always Been..."
0:03 "The Cowboys Have always Been..."
0:03 "The Cowboys Have always Been..."
0:03 "The Cowboys Have always Been..."
0:03 "The Cowboys Have always Been..."
At lest the cowboys showed up to play. I can't say the same of my Patriots.
This has accurately summed my exact feelings. That game was a travesty and the Cowboys just reaked havoc on my soul 😂😭🤦‍♀️
Stop loving the cowgirls they are like ex girlfriend that continues to cheat on you and you keep taking her back you'll continue to drink the losing cool aid drink hahahahaha.
Cowboys fans are literally the worst
nfc east Is 🗑 Yo. FrFr.
Great collection of talent, not a coherent unit.
No one good will work for Jerry Jones. It’s been forever young man. I feel bad I made my whole family Cowboys fans ! Jerry Jones is the major problem
Dak sucks against good teams and it's aggravating people pretend he's elite because all his stats are in garbage time.
nick bosa knows a thing or 2 about getting held every play
McCarthy out. Dan Q promoted to HC
Bunch of losers
After y'all beat Washington and the Eagles when both teams didn't have their starters playing, this is so satisfying to watch 😂😂
See you in 12 months, Scooter, to watch this outcome again. I'll bring the nachos.....
Man as a bucs fan I was really hoping yall would win so we could have an easy divisional game too
Thank you so much for speaking for me this entire season! You have been more entertaining than our team… unfortunately 😏 “Why do i give them so much time of my life?!” That is this season in a nutshell!😤
The music tho 😭😭😭
LOSERS!!!!  LOL!!!!
I knew my “COWBOYS” were going 2 lose. I think we can win it all; next season. Just fix that oline, secondary, and please get a new field goal kicker 🙏🏾👍🏾. And most of all; discipline!!!! LET GO COWBOYS!!!!!!
Is it bad that I only come here when the Cowboys lose?
I thought you guys were winning the super nowl
*Word for word... Every emotion...EXACTLY what I said*
All jokes aside the refs never call holding for us.I don't know how many times this season I seen 11 get held...NEVER a call.
Dak got 50 mill for garbage time heroics in the NFC East
Heheh
Been waiting on this lol
Well, on the plus side, Scooter has that much more time to figure out (a) which free agents the Boyz should sign and (b) which new people they should get on draft day
What is your bag preference? Glad or Hefty?
Go niners!!!
If we had 1 second more, we won that game. Fade to Cooper
Cowboy fans: "Every year it's the same thing"!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
love seeing cowboys lose
The way this game started out for cowboys was all we needed to see where this was heading. They should never have given the 9ers a chance.
“We’re gonna win the Super Bowl!” 🤡🤡🤡
I hope Quinn is next HC. Not Moore
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Packers fans were  right, will I ever see another SB win, I said Exact same things. Esp the "look" of stone statue I had for about 20min after the game. Girlfriend was worried
The refs ran out the stadium as fast as the fans ran in the stadium 🏃🏼‍♂️🏃🏻‍♀️. And your thumbnail is as great as the Crying Jordan. 😖
When I woke Monday am, it felt like someone died
I almost feel bad.. Almost.. But.. *insert Stephen A. Smith reaction video* 😬🤭😆😅
Everyone knew NOT to call or text me Sunday night. But Monday I heard all the trash
My mom is an Eagles fan from Phila. She called me during the game. She NEVER calls  me, I call Her! Cause I'm Her son. Wtf she rubbing it in
Respect bruh.....doing this one couldn't have been easy......BUT YOURE A GROWN MAN!!!!
So who you all playing next week 😂😂
4:16🤣🎯
Oh man, you are sooooooo going to get it lol, can't wait for your excuses!!!
And then, every Cowboys fan went to look for their Duke/Lakers/Yankees gear.
Go Niners, baby!!!!
You thought!!! 💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣💀🤣
05:07 the most accurate bit...I'm an Eagles fan and even though we lost earlier, you know I was on the phone talking shit to my Dallas loving buddies lol
I feel your pain 😞  I am a die hard cowboys fan and we had all the talent  but all the penalties  killed us and I am tired of saying  better  luck next year 😢🤦‍♂️ well see you during  the draft hopefully  we beef up are offensive  line thats what I want to see in the first round 🤙
Amazing Uso….from Oahu..much props…did the whole game under 7minutes…. (Minus your hours of editing…) 49er Niner Nation appreciate you, I forward you on my FB… If can, send your energy with our NINERS up at the hell-hole frozen Lambeau…we gonna need it…Much Love
Lol Zeek just ran 15 yards for a one yard gain!
Same thing.. every single year. I’m used to it and fully expected it.
How 'bout them Cowboys!!!   This is glorious, chapeau brother!
Ain't nothing better than a hurt Cowboys fan 😂😂🤣🤣I DRINK YOUR TEARS. The ONLY Playoff game were the best QB did not win THE ONLY ONE. Just some extra salt on those wounds, I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE.
"This does put a smile on my face.."
Gonna miss you scooter. See you next season.
How bout dem Cowboys??
Watching this and reliving it is painful! collectively all cowboys fans at the end were like nooooooo I talked way too much shit to go one and done 😆😭😂 too many penalties 😔
The curse of Jimmy Johnson continues. 26 seasons and counting. Somewhere near the Fox set.... Jimmy is cracking up.... loving every minute of Jerry's misery
You should've taken off your jersey off camera after you walked away and thrown your jersey at the couch so it works land in view of your final shot! HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That’s what you get bandwagon nation I bet $1000 this guy is not from Dallas Texas simply had a bad team growing up turned his back and jumped on the bandwagon and now he’s mad sorry loyalty over fraudulently all day
2:22 lmao
The sad background music tho 😩😂
I feel your pain, myself being a Colts fan. I like the Beethoven.✌❤🏈
Literally been waitin on this & Undisputed  😂 day made
2:22 4:51 5:06
I'm so disappointed and sad
👏🏾
This is exactly why no one likes the cowboys fans because they're myopic they won  a few games during regular season  and right away they think they're going to the super bowl what a nightmare
My favorite line, Jerry Jones you feel the disappoinment this season? How about last season? every season! What the heck you talking about. Had me dying.
We are the Dallas Cowboys and we should after many disappointing yrs. have a Great Dependable QB like say Tom Brady.
My man got a career for life with this Dallas mess.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cowboys always been a 🗑 team.
FANTASTIC🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😂
You Lose Your Black Card Bro! Deebo In A Chris Tucker Movie? 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ You Mean Ice Cube Bruhhh Man You Outta Touch With Your Black Side 😂
😊😀👀😊😀👀😊😀👀😊😀👀 NINERS!!!
This is what I've been waiting for since August!!!
Don’t give up scooter !
When the eagles fan called after the game lol
Do not complain about Micah Parsons being held.
At least with all the changes that's happening in this world with the pandemic one thing that is normal is the Cowboys blowing it when the game matters most. 🤣💀💯 #MOSTOVERRATEDTEAM
I’m so glad cowboys lost y’all had all that hype and lose in the first round lol
Never forget the Eagles went as far in a rebuild year as the Cowboys did in a “this is our year” year.
If they have Sean Lee they would have won this game.
A masterpiece! #NinerGang
You are my spirit animal....
Besides looking forward to the Cowboys playing, I really look forward to your game recap. Extremely entertaining!!! In the good and bad games. Looking forward to next season of game recaps! Thanks for all you do!
He should of shown. A inmate of all sad down it fans.
Its been one hell of a season my cowboys brethren.
I'm sorry Scoot😳
No that’s not how the EAGLES felt.. we don’t lose easy games lmaooo especially if we #3 in the league.. next year right? Lmaooo SURE
My condolences. If it makes you feel better, my 49ers were trying hard to give this game back to you.
At least you guys almost made a come back... look at my cardinals 11 points
Heart broken...again. 🥺
I WAITED ALL YEAR FOR THIS. DEM BOYZZZZ
WHAT DO YOU WANT!!! I’m sorry mom 🤣😂
It's almost like they were a decent team in a terrible division.
😅🤣 I’m not even going to poke fun, Scooter, the end of this video was so fitting, all it ended was “Who Am I” by The O’Jays playing in the background.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Preciate you taking my call after the game.  E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES
I was waiting for this and was not disappointed
The fact that you've actually talked to players and such yet still keep it 💯 in the reactions is very respectable. Bro how they played yesterday you wouldn't have known it was win or season over. I'm not even talking about missed plays, but just the energy all around was the team was not right. Furthermore it's extremely disappointing to me not that they lost in the playoffs, but that they lost THE FIRST GAME. THE VERY FIRST GAME. AT HOME. How does a team that thinks they can get to the SB lose the very first game?!?!?!?
Pain
In the history of the NFL playoffs the most penalties against a team has been 14, it happened twice. Last nights Cowboys….. and the Cowboys in 09. The most undisciplined team for years.
Takes a lot of heart to post this after a loss. You're a real one Scooter!
I FEEL this… luv u man.
mccarthy no longer with the packers, but still beating the cowboys 😅
Sorry bro.
The wicked nfl got y’all in your feelings for nothing. It’s all scripted/rigged. Don’t believe me? Look up NFL commissioner admits games are rigged for profit.
Wanna talk about it?
You lost because you're playing the NFC west. But at least you made the playoffs, so buy some more gear from Jones.
i feel ya
I felt every second of that.
This is what it feels like to watch the Cowboys : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulitftwZYkY
This loss was entirely on the Cowboys. And frankly seeing Dak and MM blame the refs instead of their shitty offense, complete lack of discipline, and not knowing the rules was really just sad.
“We can’t lose, I’ve talked too much trash for this”. This sums up Cowboy fans in general!!!!
You cowgirl fans are a bunch of little babies  you all supposed to be from Texas tough guys and girls  But I guess not go 49ers 👍🏈😂
Loved it
I feel your pain
Jesus Christ saves
That shit was too funny bro💯
I have a pure hatred for Randy Gregory now
we cant lose , i talked to much trash for this  . epitome of being a cowboys fan
Jerry Jones is good for a laugh and he is consistent at it 😭.
"We had that setup too!!!" Has my dying. 🤣
I have a question, what was longer ago? The date you were born or the last time the Cowboys won Conference Championship? 🤔 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ah love when Dallas chokes in the playoffs
Randy Gregory is a drug addict!!!!! What do you want from him!!!!
Scooter wazz right I’m never going to see a cowboys Super Bowl in my lifetime
Talkin bout u gonna  see the BUCS again 🤣 🤣🤣 yeah on TV still playing 4 the 🏆
Cowboy fans I think  dak has plateau & reached his  celling  he definitely needs a running game   I never believed the hype about the Dallas Cowboys  blowouts against the mediocre NFC East didn't impress me  & you have too many low IQ football players on your team   most astute football fans new Dallas would lose this game We just didn't know how .PS I'm  a packers fan Mike McCarthy's your problem now Good luck with that
They need a real offensive coordinator
I feel ur pain
Eagles do suck this year but they did Win a Superbowl a few years ago and what has the Cowboys done in the last 26 years, not a God damn thing. 😁
From 5:00 on, pure gold.
This was so sweet!
Do you wanna talk about it?
This dude for real or this an attempt at "comedy"?
Don't worry cowboy fans,the cowboys will get better in five more years
This may be the funniest most accurate comedic piece in sports history.
Lmao
The video ending with you staring blankly at the screen was me for about 15 minutes after the game yesterday. Total disbelief. QB draw w/ 14 seconds left and no TO’s… bye bye season.. unreal
this hurtr my soul. I now have PTSD
THAT TRULY WAS FUNNY!  WELL DONE.
Good music choice too!
Thank you for bringing a little life to being a cowboys fan; it’s been 15 years of emotional damage 😪
Very funny!
Niners baby!!!!
😂😂🅿️🅿️🅿️🐍🐍
We got exposed like Tristin Thompson
Lol bruh I'm dying right now FAITHFUL
Damn...
Priceless. The rest of the league thanks you for this bounty.
We ain't gonna win or go to another Superbowl unless Dak Prescott is our QB and Mike Mcarthy being our head coach. Dak can't handle the big game. That Qb draw was so idiotic
“This is our house, baby!” JG
totally accurate the only thing you forgot was the crying and the praying at the end😂😭😭
LOLLLLLLL GO NINERS Y'ALL.     But seriously, Jimmy G is literal garbage and I swear he needs to be kicked to the curb this offseason
As a Ravens fan this season is gonna be gr........  tears ACL    Damnit. Maybe next year.
Great editing
this literally gave me ptsd its too accurate my gooood im still sad
Why does he have the succession music in the background lol
EPIC
Would’ve loved one last “man in depressed” to finish off this incredible story
If y’all keep saying “this is our year every year” you’re bound to be right at least once before the eventual heat death of the planet…right? Lmao
Go 9ers!
I didn't know how much I needed this video! I felt every one of those same emotions. It was a brutal game
The most profitable team in sports for nothing. Enough is enough. Stop handing money to Jerry Jones. #Cowboycott until they win a Super Bowl
I've been waiting for this video 😂
same song every year
Deeeeeeebooooooo
I understand your pain!!! Try being a Raider fan!!!! Lol!!!! But one thing about the cowboys team, young and no experience,  dak is not a veteran and Elliot is a joke as a running back. Numbers don't lie!!!
This was me and all Cowboy fans! Lol! Wait till next season !
Niners baby
😂 this was hilarious 😂😂 go 49ers!
This was me…tired of this sh!t
Be happy you didn't have to play Patrick Mahomes with a retiring QB and got blown da fuck out
I really feel bad for cowboy fans. :(((
Gregory was so frustrated he tackled a guy blocking him, if only he and the others could tackle Deebo like that they would be advancing instead.
As a Seahawk, I guarantee you, The 4WHINers, along with the Rams, Aint gonna win the Super Bowl.  You can add that to your bank account!!
I wish the Cowboys when I'm sorry
WHY DO I GIVE THEM SO MUCH TIME OF MY LIFE...FOR THIS???  😆
bang bang niner gang
The only home team to lose in the playoffs this weekend and then they blame the refs for everything 🤣 them Cowboys are who we thought they were lol 🚮
Go niners
Perfect!! Lol
Bang bang..  How bout them Niners!!!!
Damn bro that was great
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS
Dak and Zeke will be eating up 25% of the salary cap next year. Expect Amari Cooper to be a cap hit. Dak, DeMarcus Lawrence, Zack Martin, Zek, Tyron Smith and La'el Collins combined eat up 63% of the salary cap and that is money they can't get out of because of the dead cap hits.
Bra this was me definitely, spot on every reaction, I will look forward to your skits next year.   #wegointothesuperbowl 2023 book it 😂
🤣🤣
A QB draw with no timeouts has to be one of the dumbest plays I've ever seen get called  This ain't college football
the only problem of Cowboys is QB.
I can't breathe 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
There's a reason why people call the NFC EAST the NFC LEAST.  Garbage Dak is only good against them and bad teams.  He is trash against winning non NFC Least teams.  It was a huge mistake to pay a below average QB elite QB money.  No teams were willing to pay him 30 mil if they let him shopped around.  Especially not coming back from the season ending injury.  The Cowboys were just too dumb.
Hey Cowboys fans, since 1996 Jake Delhomme has won more playoff games. Brad Johnson has won more playoff games. Trent Dilfer has won more playoff games. Mark "butt-fumble" Sanchez has won more playoff games. *cough*
Scooter, I just love you man. Even though you are a Cowboy fan…
Thanks for the video's brother! I always enjoy them. God bless you for your time and effort🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
The Saddest part is when you have to put your jerseys away n wait till next season 😒😫😤
What would have more impact on the Cowboys' future? A new coach or a new general manager?
🤣🤣🤣
I'm just going to save this video to watch again next year. When it happens again.
Love these videos when you ask lose!!! #FlyEagkesFly yeah I know we lost.  But wev are rebuilding and over performed this year.  Dem Boyz with all that talent still the same result.  Gotta hurt!!
I hope Dallas signs Mike McCarthy to a 20 year contract.
As a niner fan i was waiting for this video to come out so badly😂😂
Rest In Peace Cowboys fans.  Hopefully you guys promote Winslow for 3-4 years.  I guess McCarthy will be the fall guy for this one. Gotta have a fall guy in Dallas with all that talent.   All world Talent and can’t get out of the wildcard weekends. Oooof.  Next year will be your year.
This video shows the futility of Idol worship and the vanity of giving worship to men instead of God. People ask whats the harm in missing church to follow my team, its only 5 months out of the year and God gets the rest! God desires, deserves and demands priority of your adoration so remember that next time you ask God in a quick prayer to favor your team over another in a jam. 31 out of 32 teams will feel this way in February so remember those odds and even if your team wins they are quickly pushed out the door as soon as the draft comes and all teams are champions again at least on paper and in the minds of the fans!
24 hours is still too short... don't talk to me for a week after that game...
GO BIRDS.... JALEN IS A QB 2.
Success does not come overnight. It took Tom Landry 7 years to have the Cowboys in the playoffs. Patience is hard to do but with a few more ingredients , they will be able to beat these top teams. Running game needs a whole lot improvement and need a Lot of disopline. Penalties are costing them games. Got to stop this
Next year our year fosho
49ERS! 49ERS! 49ERS WIN. THEY GO THROUGH TO THE DIVISIOAL ROUND. GO 49ERS! BEAT THE PACKERS. WE ARE A BIG THREAT AND I LOVE IT.
Went through so many emotions.
I'm no longer a cowboys fan
Don’t worry they gonna win the Super Bowl next year 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 hell no
#BangBangNinerGang
CHRIST ALMIGHTY, I've never felt a video touch my soul like this one here.... I love this team so much, it hurts me every year to watch people laugh at what used to be a glorious franchise. Queue my Deborah Cox.
Every year cowgirls fans say wait until season 🤣 How many years have they been saying that
Zero accountability. Accurate
If it makes you feel better the Cowboys can still go to the Superbowl. They just have to buy tickets first.
It's the Beethoven music in the background playing the whole time for me
Watching my dad watch this game ( who is a cowboys fan ) was real unfortunate cause you could here the pain from the disappointment
Two years in a row packers fans are right about mike McCarthy, when will you learn
We got way to many penalties on both sides of the ball like HOW U GONNA GET A HOLDING CALL ON DEFENSE WHY IS A D LINEMAN HOLDING THERES NO BENEFIT FROM THAT. Not to mention the reffs missed so much on the 49ers but at the end of the day we beat ourselves
Yep. Pretty much how I imagined this video would go. So sorry for your loss.   ~Panther Fan
😅😅😅😅
Jesus loves you
Cowboys fans, y’all want to talk about it?
It hurts so bad watching this
You now know the pain that ALL us  eagles fans felt
This may be the worst playoff game ever from the cowboys. Literally no discipline
It takes a real man to make a video like this after a game ended like that. Now you know why we were happy to see McCarthy get fired in Green Bay. His clock management skills are so bad that they are nonexistent.
LETS GOOO BEETHOVEN IS BACK 😍🔥😭
Been waiting for this!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It hurts so bad...every year.   But we are winning the super bowl next year!!!!
Pain…
I watched this just to watch a Cowboy fan cry.
"I'm sorry Mom" 😂😅😭😭
😂😂 I was waiting on his video Cowboy Fans are the best at losing 🎣
"Jerry Jones, you can't remember the last time you were this disappointed? I remember: LAST SEASON! EVERY SEASON!"- That's why we're going crazy, lol We're turning into Eagles fans, throwin' crap at people! Is this who we really want to be??
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS??? 😂😂😂
ROFL!!!😂
Thick or thin DC4L  I’m not one of these fake fans I’m in this for life WIN OR LOSE still my Boys
Why do I give them so much time of my life? 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
It still hurts the day after 😢😭😢😭
THE COWBOYS ARE WINNING THE SUPER BOWL!!! LOOOOL. we love you scooter! it's not to late to switch teams lol.
Cowboy's America's Bytch
As a 49ers fan, I love this.
The only cowboys fan I like
NinerGAng
This is classic! Kudos to you man!
This is classic! Kudos to you man!
After watching the NFL for 50 plus years, you have to ask yourself:  Why do good teams stay good year in and year out, while other teams are up and down, and others suck continuously?  Which leads to the next question:  What always stays the same on crappy teams?  The answer:  THE OWNERS OF THE TEAMS.  The Chiefs are Exhibit A.  Just good enough to win the Division.  Never good enough to win in the playoffs.  And I think Lamar Hunt was okay with that, as long as he sold out Arrowhead.  Then he died in 2006, and son Clark took over. Chiefs 1970 to 2006....eleven post seasons  2006-present..... nine post seasons.
Man this team is way over hyped and I called it
As a eagles fan that knew my team would be trash this year i actually thought this was yall year
Lost because the team came out flat again with their constant slow starts. You can’t do that against good teams. I also feel like Dak doesn’t do everything necessary to win especially when his accuracy is off which was most of the times since the calf strain. He may not have run the ball as much fearing he would strain it again but whatever the reason I’m starting to see him as another Romo that couldn’t win playoff games.
Omgosh you are LAFFS!!
The refs did run off the field mad quick 😅
Me at the end of the game, getting the ball back, driving down the field.   👇🏽👇🏽👇🏽  *"Don't... Don't give me hope."*  Hawkeye - Avengers Endgame
I really don’t think dak is the problem Connor Williams should’ve been replaced with Terrance Steele honestly he’s penalty king, zeke is so overrated gets worse and worse every year pollard should be starter, kellen Moore is absolutely garbage they should get rid of him cuz I think Dan Quinn has done a good job with the defense cee dee lamb hasn’t been doing much the last couple of games and wrs need to catch the ball can’t be dropping passes that go through your hands, it’s a whole list of problems and dak gets all the pressure not saying he’s perfect he has his ups and downs but I don’t think we lost cuz of dak this game I think everyone else fucked it up also mike McCarthys time management and decisions are killer too
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Next year though!!!...
This was actually pretty depressing because he’s spot on.
Difference between your 'Super Bowl' Cowboys and Philly this season, Eagles were supposed to be in a rebuilding year with no expectations, instead got a playoff berth and 3 first round picks in the draft. Ope.
As a cowboys fan I must say that,  If we don’t win when it matters then none of this matters.  I.e  If we can’t win in the playoffs then everything we did in the regular season doesn’t matter.
He should have thanked Jimmy for missing more than just that one past.  Jimmy is killing us.
🤣 When MOM called you better pick up 🤣
Dak Bumscott is the worst QB in the NFL. OVERRATED
WE'LL BE SEEING THIS GUY IN MOVIES SOON.. GREAT STUFF 👍🏿
Yo that Nick game was getting lit! 🤣🤣 Side note: the only home team to lose at home! 👏🏾👏🏾
FIRE EVERYONE ‼️‼️
That’s exactly how I felt. Our team is so undisciplined 🤬🤬🤬. Kellen Moore is a step up from Jason Garrett but he’s still a trash play caller.
Go Niners!
Skip, Stephen A, and Scooter are the reason I love to watch the Cowboys.........lose.
We all been waiting for this VIDEO HAHA BYE BYE COWGIRLS
That was me the entire game and my team won. Great video, much respect to the Cowboys players. Your coach, not so much.
As a Cowboys hater, I almost had three heart attacks. But, at the end, it was all good.
As a Jets fan, I wish we could play the Cowboys every year :)
guess I'm a Bengals fan now, Who Dey.
and Jerry is keeping McCarthey..... lol smh
Go Titans.
Did anybody see Stephen A with a cowboy hat yesterday morning lol
I’ve been waiting and checking for this video lmaaao 😂😂 I love your vids bro!
I hate how this music is tainted in my head. RIP Jeremiah Johnson.
This and stephen a smith i was waiting for this
As a niners fan, this gives me great joy :3
Season finale time
as a hardcore DC fan its better off they lost this game than clutching it and us fans stressing and pulling our damn hair out to them playing the Buccs.
LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL 27 yrs and counting LOL LOL LOL LOL...he sounds like marlin wayans LOL LOL
I like win the Cowboys is one done
"The Eagles are SO GARBAGE!!"  Ooof...
[INCOHERENT COWBOY YELLING]... That sums it up... in case you missed it.
I figure the Cowgirls can only win if they copy history. Just like when they  signed Dino Sanders...They have to find a way to sign Debo Samuels to a contract.
Awesome!   Hahaha
Look at the bright side scooter. You get an early vacation from making videos, and the cowboys can try to win one while you are on your death bed 70 years from now. How poetic is that?
Hell at least with shit teams like the lions, the fans at least know that there shit and don’t expect much at all, but the cowboys always find ways to break our hearts each and every time. It really does hurt being a cowboys fan. So this is what being browns fan feels like
Ah, Primal Scream Therapy.   Classic.
Twenty. Six. Years. 26 years yall. This team is a let down every year.
I can feel the pain through the screen but it'll be okay there's always next year - Sincerely an Eagles fan
Yup we was right about Mike McCarthy
That ending though.         *_I felt that shit._*
Booooooo. Cowboys !!!
Giving up Cowboys games after the Dez (no) catch has been the best thing for my health.
I hope you guys are enjoying Mike McCarthy! GO PACK GO!
I could not and did not, want to speak to anyone the rest of the evening. I was literally quiet and frustrated lol. Even while having dinner. I just couldn't!
He going cry in the car 😆
And now time for the cowboy fan cycle to resume. Like a phoenix reborn from its own ashes, soon the hope will return, fresh and new like a newborn chick
Offense is broken. No chemistry or consistency.
Poor disciplined team with 14 penalties, poor offensive execution, poor coaching decisions made by McCarthy the entire game. They lost two of their best D-linemen and their best linebacker and we just could not pull it together. Once again, see ya next year Dallas. Dallas Cowboys for life!
I enjoy all of your videos!
The better team won... 😏
Do you want to talk about it?
They fucking choked that last possession
As a Niners fan, I LOVE this video!! Lol
glad you didn't cry like some cowboy fans, I act almost the same way about my Raiders,stiff upper lip dude ..
Grossi laughs in number 1 seed
That was etertaining
I feel bad for Scooter.
Man, you lost some serious weight.
At least you guys didn’t lose to KC. Oh wait…..
Cowboys might have won it all if they had won this game. They certainly had the talent to.
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
As a 49er fan I found this very funny 👍👍
Pain
NFC EAST Strikes Again!
How Bout Them Cowboys !!!  what a joke of a franchise tbh, Jerry's ability to make this circus the most valued franchise in the world should be enough to these annoying fans, but they can't keep their mouths shut 💪🤣
Scooter you do a great job of saying what the rest of us are thinking. I am SO sick of this crap! Why can other teams live up to their potential and we cannot? 2 words .. Jerry Jones
As long as Jerry Jones is the owner of the Dallas Cowboys this what going to happen every year.  Garbage in and garbage out!
Ahhh I love the heartbreak of cowboy fans 😀
lolololo.  Niners fan here.  I could feel your pain.  You are hilarious!  I cannot imagine how I would feel if we had a chance to win and ran out of time like that.  I have never seen anything like that.  Sorry my brother.  Go niners?
@5:50 sums it up.
How bout them cowboys 😂😂, we suck and you guys won the east, swept us and were supposed to be in the super bowl and just lasted 4 hours longer 😂
This is like listening to and watching chalk scratch an old chalkboard
I'm not ready to watch this yet.
I literally told my family when Dallas FIRST got the ball: if cowboys don’t score on this drive, They’re losing this game. I hate being right all the time
I been waiting for this all day 💯🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So crazy how that game finished and jimmy g with that pick I did the yep looks about right
You can tell Cameron is a Oreo dude said only deebo I’m scared of is in a Chris tucker movie smh ice cube wrote and produced that movie bro
Ditto
At least you have the lightning
COWBOYS 4ever! Eff the haters
Lmao.  Was waiting for this.
Im laughing so true 🤣😅🤣😅
Dallas still stinks 😂 😂 😆
NOT LIKE THIS🤦🏿🥃
I can relate to that feeling at the end. I just can't
Hahahaha!!! hilarious video.
These videos are a little better when they lose. It's science!
Hahahahaha damn homie I’m a 49er fan for life but you had me rolling. Subscribing now   Good luck next year oh and you guys need to fire your HC
This needs to be spammed to every Cowboys player...for the reals...🤬🤯🤠
😩😂😩😂😩😂😩😂😩😂
Sorry Scoot, it's 1990s again and the Niners gotta face off against Brett Faverere and the Packers. Dallas and GB never really had a rivalry back then
Poor scootermagruder! Hang in there
Great video keep up the faith 🙏
As a Packers fan I dont know why, but I feel bad for Cowboys fans.
So I wonder how Dallas feels being the only division winner to lose the wild card game! What a joke of a franchise!!
Atleast we put up a fight unlike the cardinals 😔
At this point if i remain a cowboys fan, its confirmed that I'm a masochist.
until our general manager is replaced we will continue to LOOSE
The power of self deprecation..  I can’t do it any better than what you already have..  I’m an Eagles fan dammit!!
Scooter experiencing the seven stages of grief in under 30 seconds.
That fumble had me acting the same way!
The video I never wanted to have to watch. I actually shouted "I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT!" to my brother.
14 Penalties. I've never seen a team implode like the Cowboys did.
Broncos fan…I feel your pain…
Don't all of those penalties point to a poorly coached, unprepared team? As stupid as that last play call was to end the game (and that mutha sucka was as stupid as it gets in that situation), 14 penalties is not a team with a good coach. Period. They were unprepared and it was blatantly obvious!!!
It was everything I was hoping it would be
😭
You going to listen to Packers fans next time now
I thought it was your year cowgirls lolololololol
😂 was waiting for in stadium fan reactions clips
Deadass my heart can’t no more bro I’m given them unit the end of daks contract is over
"Nobody contact me for 24 hours" Proceeded by Grossi calling him immediately after the game ended
5:07 to 5:16 had me laughing, I loved seeing his reaction to the "America's Team".
This year is starting off good Alabama lost the Cowboys got bounced in the Wildcard good times.  Money well spent on Dak he couldn't even win against a lower seed team at home. I guess it isn't always true you get what you pay for.
“…oh, hi mum.” 😂
That last shot, with the long, exasperated stare and the closing of the laptop and an emotionless "I'm done."  Perfect.
I feel you bro 😪 😢 😔 still #cowboys4life
Next season you should actually film yourself during the game and mix in clips in this style of video😂
fly eagles flyyyy
Only a level of failure Leaf’s fans could understand.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If it makes you feel any better, Tom Grossi's team is the only one from Clickbait Sports still in the playoffs.
I as a lions I feel the anger pain
This almost made me feel sad for Scooter….
as a texans fan this year was pretty chill for me, i knew wed suck and accepted it, just got to watch things play out no vested interest in outcomes.
Captured my pain perfectly!😥
You a kountry Wayne should do a cowboys are trash video
Hey at least ya didn't lose to Jacksonville and not even get in. Like my team did 😒
I'm going to be surprised if my boys show up tomorrow for work, they talked trash all week about how the cowboys were going to win 52-10 over the niners and how the bills were going to get smashed there going to eat some cold crow tomorrow
I feel exactly like you😭😭. It happens every year, penalties bad coaching you name it. It's so frustrating watching them play every year!! How are we the number 1 scoring offense in the league and have 7 points at half?!! And like u said will I ever see them in the super bowl?? If they are like this I will never see them I'm the super bowl or even win a playoff game. We are good against bad teams but when it comes to big games we play like absolute garbage. It's ridiculous
Mediocre team. Inflated expectations. They will never play in another super bowl. Acceptance is the first step to healing…Think, if they had waited one year we could have Russell Wilson, but Jerruh has no vision. They don’t know how to build a team that can be a perennial contender. Instead, Jerry thinks the talent on his team is a feather in his cap, and he’ll be damned if some other team gets HIS guy. Pay that man! Pay all of them! Max deals for everyone! ‘But Jerry, don’t you think we should invest in our deteriorating offense line?’ ‘Silence, peasant! You don’t need to block when you have Dak, Zeke and Coop on the same team! You’re dismissed.’
Hey if the cowboys werent in the NFC Least, they wouldnt even had a chance to make the playoffs. So at least theres that.
Oh my God oh my God oh my God I have never laughed so hard nonstop for 6 minutes with tears streaming out of my eyes as I have just now. I have a headache I laughed so damn hard. Go Niners!!!! God Almighty that was funny, every single second of it. I swear to God this video is going to go viral. Especially with 49er fans!!!
Well as an Eagles fan See you after the summer. Enjoy your mental vacation while you regain your composure and allow yourself to get rid of any cowboy thoughts
Excellent video, Scooter!!! Keep up the great work...
Yo play some DbD you will feel better 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Packers fans warned you people about McCarthy and ya didn't listen
Eagles fans are taking applications to become a fan, when you can fill yours out and send it in
Overrated!
4:53 Wish it was Tom Grossi
Just be happy you weren't the most least competitive playoff team. 😭
And Mark Sanchez still has more playoff wins than the cowboys have had since 2000
Can't wait for Clickbait Sports
So……..how bout those Cowboys???? 😂
Cowboys fans want want to talk about it?
I felt this video man. Another year gone. I feel Jerry being mad. Dude wants to at least see another NFC Championship before he goes. Sheesh
Just be happy your team didn’t go 3-0 at the beginning of the season and then proceed to go 2-12 the rest of the season, like the Panthers :/
Need a post credit scene...
Came here to drop this off. Suck it Cowboys! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iXZSv29reks
It’s like when Pete Carroll lost the Super Bowl a few years back by trying to be cocky and pass on the 2 yard line instead of handing it to Marshaun Lynch.. Kellen Moore got cocky or lazy with the Offensive Scheme… maybe he was to busy interviewing for another job… 🤦‍♂️
1 and done
I've waited weeks for this.
I wish I can yell like scooter.ecéry year same shit.
Best reaction ever😂😂😂😂
It's funny how two hours ago I was searching for this video 😆 🤣
Hilarious.  The alter ego of Jerry Jones.
Get rid of Dak and we’ll win draft a starting quarterback Dak is a third string quarterback at best I wouldn’t trade a cup of cold owl piss for dak
Nest head has to go ,
This was me.
As a 49ers fan....basically our game as well. I was screaming about how trash we were...Jimmy G missing wide open throws...false starting on 4th and an inch to seal the game....much respect for y'all  for messing up just enough to let us win. Thanks Cowboy Nation, see you next year!
Cowboys the joke of the nfl top of the league talent but choke every year it's so funny to watch
Always hating on my eagles 🤬I’m glad ya lost too. 🦅🦅🦅
Zeke just ran the ball for 15 yards and got a 1 yard gain😭😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😂
I was waiting for this after Grossi's fan reaction to the game.  Both were very entertaining, especially since I can't stand the Cowboys. They stopped being America's Team decades ago.
I've waited all day for this. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 The memez was EPIC after the game. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where the refs at why the refs leave so soon 😂😂😂
I have a feeling this game may have broken you…wanna talk about it?
Legit. Such a disappointment. They have no discipline. And can we PLEASE get rid of Conner Williams!? 🥴
You love to see it 😄
dudes gonna pretend like the refs didnt tackle dak on that last play
The accuracy 💯💯💯💯
I sympathize. I'm a Rams fan going back to 79. You can't imagine how many of those days I've had.  Getting all worked up.  Rams are winning the SB, tho....so, it all good.
😂😂😂😂
Bro you are funny asf.
Respect my man. We both know my giants suck. I wanted you to win this game. Just don't tell my dad
Now that all the dead weight teams are out the way the real playoffs can start
I’m a cowboys fan and have been since I was a kid, that being said I can’t take this anymore. I think it’s time to move on to a new team 😞
As an eagles fan watching the Cowboys blow it sure made Sunday it little more happy
The way they lost is the most Cowboy thing of all time
I started crying at the fact that he was like jerry Jones your don’t remember the last time you were disappointed I do last season every season 😂😂
24 hours up yet?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was looking forward to this. It's beautiful.
NO ONE CONTACT ME FOR 24 HRS!  “ WHAT DO YOU WANT!”  “I’m sorry mom..”   Hahaha 🤣
Someone needs to hack the star and play this on every TV
Bro, go to the UFC. Team sports are hella overrated. Plus, team won’t be good until the Jones name isn’t involved. So, that will never happen. We should start a petition to remove all Jones’s from the Dallas Cowboys.
This had me rolling my guy
The Pain is insane
Cowboys tears taste delicious
Ahahaha..."hope Bosa feels better, after the game"!
My team hasn't made the playoffs in 8 years.  3 coaches in 6 years.
As a giants fan. Respect. I thought you might skip this one
I waited all day for this! Did not disappoint!!!
I said this in another video: I feel the problem is (aside from discipline) the cowboys never play anyone good. They’re so used to playing against bad teams that they lose confidence when playing against a more top tier team that’s better than them and they know it. The inexperience really shows and can’t improve if you’re always playing against the mediocre. Let’s stay strong for our sake cowboy nation and hope that maybe someday our time will come
I was so dejected after this game. Every year they break my heart 😭😭😭😭. It’s not even a joke anymore
Packers fans on McCarthy: “Reality is often disappointing”
COWBOYS SUCK THEY REALLY REALLY SUCK, COWBOYS SUCK THEY REALLY REALLY SUCK
I WAS WAITING
I was like u the whole game, specially on the last drive, just darkness when the gamed ended like that "We aint dem boys"
🥺😢😭
🤷‍♂️
Cowboys fans talking about refs but you guys getting penalties and guys had so much chances to score but didnt
I like the part when he screamed at the top of his lungs...tf
Still GO COWBOYS!!! next year but still.
Idk why I watch to relive the trauma..
Time to chant the official Cowboys motto: "Maybe next year..." : (
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS  ~Sincerely, An Eagles fan
You can adopt my Browns motto, There's always next year...
I can’t find my lip balm 😭
Dak. Zeke. All receivers. Our defense initially. Coaching. I’m 33 and tired of this shit haha every year I can actually remember, we’ve sucked.   Let’s bring back Quincy Carter. T.O. Anyone. Doesn’t matter.
As a 49ers fan I had about 3 heart attacks in the final 5 minutes alone…great video, made me laugh
The Dallas cowgurls cycle = season starts, BEATS up on bad teams, fans Get delusional, "we dem boyz! this our year lol 😂, CHOKE IN THE PLAYOFFS LOL I love it ♥️ #joinus
Time to clean house Conor Williams, Anthony Brown, and DLaw can go
Lord the passion!!!
First: The Refs Cost my Hawks.  And now the refs cost the Cowboys.  (Get New Refs who knows the game) #GetNewRefs
I've been waiting for this video for the past 24 hours!  It never disappoints.  Deebo Samuel is a grown man!  Jerry Jones is the greatest GM Dallas has ever had.  You keep doing what you do best Jerry!
U got beat by a better TEAM with more experience. They manhandled the cowgirls. The game was over after the first 2 possessions
Damn! Lifelong Steelers fan here.  Feel for you Scooter 💔
This was the first year I could barely sleep cuz I was so stressed out I hate hearing how bad we are but every year they prove the haters right
Oooo scooters video of cowboys playoffs. Time to grab the popcorn 🍿
I've been waiting on this video all day, go in brother!😔
In a perfect world: WE DEM BOYZ vs STILLERS GONNA SUPABOLL
I just came for the rant, @4:41 love it.  Eagles suck too but we over achieve than under perform.
Nice video...now go buy your mother some flowers to make up for your indiscretion.
Not gonna lie, I was half rooting for the 49ers because pain brings out the best in ScooterMagruder. Some people have to suffer for their art...
Better be on Clickbait this week dont run lmfaooooooo
Life long 49ers fan (7 years old in 1979) that was born and raised in Dallas here. I spent that game in a garage full of Cowboys fans and I heard just about everything in this video during that game. That, and superstitious nonsense "You two went outside to have a smoke when the Cowboys scored, you gotta stay outside until the Cowboys don't score." =)
How about those boys 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Well ScooterGaming has plenty of time now right?
We all hurt.
"we can't lose, I talked too much trash for this"
Man, you are right on point. That’s exactly how I was watching the game. I even asked my wife that question, “will They ever win Super Bowl in my life time?” After that, I just sat their quietly… lol.. spot on video
Another calm and cool reflection on a complete disaster.
Hahaha good vid but #ninersnation
As a cowboys fan, I was glad to see us lose. We in no way deserved that win. 15 penalties is unnacceptable, especially when we had as many chances as we did to tie or win. I guess one good thing is that we wont lose many players.
When are we getting the Scooter x Skip Bayless crossover episode?
We needed a "next year is our year!" at the end. 😂😂
I've been waiting for this video all day
it was the 4th and 2 for me....they punted on 4th and 2.
Whos your daddy
P a i n
At least your team isn’t getting smacked right now on National television smh
Micah at lb was weak game plan play him at the de was better for him
I’ve been waiting for this updating my YouTube every minute. You are a treasure!!! Even if the cowboys aren’t😂
The thumbnail is giving me so much pleasure right now. I'm gonna watch it again.....
💀💀💀💀💀💀 😁😁😁😁😁😁 as an Eagles fan I’m crying with laughter right now!!!!!!!!!!! Lol yeah we loss too 🤷🏾‍♂️so what 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 the cowboys lost was very enjoyable 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀.
Those last ten seconds of silence had me on the edge of my seat.  I thought Scooter was gonna explode.
This was not acting.
The moment we have all been waiting for since this game ended 😂
I'm sry scooter 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ay who’s going to the Super Bowl again… can’t remember the name of the team. Damn
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Now do you know what I had to feel as a Giants fan after 2016???
You had the integrity to make this. A lil late. But I understand.  We kicked yalls asses. Could have scored more too.  Bang Bang Niner Gang!!!
Not watching sorry scoot. Just came here to comment 🤣
We should of won
Deebow smoking 🚬 on cowboy 🤠 pack 💨💨💨💨💨🤯🤯🤯🤯😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Y'all need to approach Jimmie Johnson, and apologize to him for the way he was treated by JERRUH JONES, and ask Jimmie to remove the CURSE he has on the Cowboys.
LOL…. Was waiting for you!
Whew man good stuff, I was so that eagle fan making fun of y'all for losing when we lost 5 seconds before. Lol
Dak , MIA, yet again….Kellen Moore trying to make calls to help Dak. Don’t work. End of the game Dak doubles down, happy the fans threw trash on the Refs…….mentally broken. Blame everyone but not responsibility for your play.
I'm sorry, Scooter. I can't even watch this one, bro. In fact, after 30+years as a die hard fan watching them do this year in and year out, especially with their historical feats on offense, defense and as a team this year, and to lose like that in the first round, I can watch no longer. I'm through with this team. To the point I can't bring myself to watch what's, as always, probably really good content. Best wishes, and I hope it counts as a view that I at least clicked and liked the video. Be safe and stay healthy ✌
Nah this one hurt 😞
Can’t wait to see you at clickbait sports with that beautiful jimmy jersey!! It’ll look so great on you! Ha!!!! HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS 😂😂
the music😆
Can’t lose I talked to much trash 2:22 -every cowboy fan 2022
Ending tho.....bruh
This video warms my soul as an Eagles fan
Being a Cowboys fan is like being in an abusive relationship. We love our team but they keep hurting us. Then they tell us that this time will be different only to hurt us all over again, every, single, year! Well I have some pain to vent and so I am going to do it here.  We all know what the problem is, the Cowboys organization is garbage and has been for some time. Year after year after year the Cowboys shoot themselves in the foot with dumb mistakes and penalties that component organizations don't make routinely. We suffered under Garret for nearly a decade. It sickens me to think of all the talented careers that were wasted by the Cowboys organization. The owner desperately needs to fire the GM. Unfortunately the owner won't fire the GM because the owner IS the freaking GM!   Yes Mike McCarthy should be fired because he does nothing for the team at best and actively hurts the team at worst. Jerry probably won't fire him but even if he does, so what, he will just hire another puppet who won't do anything to instill discipline in a team that has desperately needed it for years. Oh and sure it's not just McCarthy or Jerry that are the issue. I don't know what happened to the Dak Prescott and Kellen Moore that we saw before the bye week but I would really love to have the early season QB and OC back because the offense was inconsistent at best for the second half of the season and a large amount of that blame fall on the shoulders of Dak and Kellen. The play calling in the 49ers game was baffling and Dak's throws have been uncharacteristically off target for over a month now. I don't know what happened but the organization was obviously aware of Dak's slump and never found a way to fix it, though that is on Dak as well (though I frankly wouldn't be surprised if it is later revealed that Dak was playing through some sort of injury because he just looked off during the 2nd half of the season). I know Zeke was playing through injury but considering all the money he is being paid he has sure been a disappointment in the 2nd half of the season too and he has dropped a LOT of crucial passes in that same span of time.   The biggest problem on offense though is the Offensive Line. First off, Zack Martin is fantastic and one of the best Guards in the NFL. We have 1/5th of a great offensive line. La'el Collins is solid at RT. Tyler Biadasz has proved that he is just not the long term answer at Center though I will admit that he got better as the year went on. Tyron Smith was a great LT but the man is showing his age and nowadays he is good for about 1 critical holding penalty per game. Of course he pales in comparison to the 2021 NFL Penalty Yards champion Connor WIlliams. This guy was single handedly responsible for 130 yards on 12 penalties including 10 holding penalties! What the actual heck!  The Cowboys SHOULD use this offseason to rebuild their offensive line but they can't because they are losing a lot of critical pieces on both offense and defense to free agency this year. We can't pay for most of these players because all of our money is locked up to pay for the huge contracts of inconsistent talent like Zeke and Demarcus Lawrence, and now Dak. Leighton Vander Esch is going to be gone for sure, Keanu Neal likely is too. Same thing with Carlos Watkins, 3 of our 4 safeties, Randy Gregory, Dorance Armstrong, Michael Gallup, Dalton Schultz, and Cedrick Wilson. The only good news here is that Connor Williams is a free agent next year but it would not surprise me at all if Jerry resigns him and lets the others walk.  To conclude, in Tom Grossi's chat during the livestream of the 49ers game yesterday, some guy sarcastically asked what the difference between between Detroit and Dallas was. I replied "Detroit has hope for the future." I stand by that statement. So long as Jerry Jones is alive and kicking the Cowboys organization will continue to be a hot mess that overpays for and then wastes the career of talented players. They aren't like the Lions because the Cowboys EXPECT to win the NFC East every year and usually they have the talent to at least get close to meeting that expectation (especially lately which has more to do with the NFC East itself than the Cowboys). It wouldn't hurt so much if the Cowboys were just a crap team who I expected to lose. Instead the Cowboys are a talented team who will usually make us think, "yes this is the year, this year they can do it" and then get close enough to make you feel a moment of triumph only to snatch it away and hurt you again. That is the pain that I an every Cowboys fan feels yet again. Maybe next year...but probably not, it will just be more of the same...Go Cowboys!
At least Dak won the NVP lol
Cowboys are trashhhh
Packers fans were right this man garbage lol go pack go 💛💚💛💚
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Clickbait classic coming up! This was the best punishment so far...
“We can’t lose. I’ve talked too much trash”  Can’t that be a weekly line?
Just wait, they'll never disappoint.......😁😁😁
I'm definitely a Dallas fan and buddy summed up every emotion in this video 🤣🤣🤣. The ending deserves an Emmy nod.
I felt this one…This one hurt, bad!
Watch his take in the urinatingtree stream then watch this and it’s 10X better 😂
As an eagles fan I cant be mad at his 1st statement  #GoEagles
I am a longtime cowboys fan, and it is ridiculous that so many cowboys fans keep drinking the same jerry and media hype kool aid decade after decade.  They just don't view the team objectively.  The 2021-22 cowboys got fat on bad teams and backup QBs.  There are glaring holes on both sides of the line.  And Until jerry and his kin are gone, the organization will continue to hire a coaching staff and personnel staff (that includes the overhyped mcclay who no other organization makes any serious attempt to hire) that puts together flawed rosters.  Prescott is not a franchise QB.  Fans and the media so desperately try to spin and convince themselves that he is.  And now, the OL is old --again.  Jimmy was the one smart hire jerry ever made and he drove him away because of his bruised ego.  He has enriched himself and his family by cashing in on the cowboys myth, but remains clueless in putting together a winning team because he wants to play GM and claim the credit.  26+ years later--his standing as the worst GM in the history of all pro sports (face it, jimmy was the real GM when he was with dallas) is his lasting legacy.
I can’t wear cowboys gear for another year now 😡
I saw this coming.  Maybe rest your starters in a meaningless week 18 game next time.
I'm a Washington Football team fan  Win or lose I love coming here to see your Cowboys fans game reaction lmfao  Always a good time over here
One and done.
The lone Texans fan (me): I got a spare paper bag from H.E.B. if you want it, dude.
I’m a die hard cowboys fan & I can’t even imagine being a cowboys fan: just kill me, please
I thought this was OUR year!!!   To the 49ers fans:  You'll all regret it next season
Started out with the sad music.
This is exactly how I felt.
Eagles were in a rebuild and still made it just as far…
I felt that last few seconds of the video. I looked at the tv the same way... Let's have some humble pie and move on.
"I hope Bosa gets better... After this game.." 😆
I have nothing against the cowboys but man they have the most annoying fanbase that I look forward to them losing so I can talk mess
Could've played the CARDINALS. BUT NOOOOO... one more week added. Look at the CARDINALS now. BLOWOUT by the RAMS. That could've been the score yesterday. THANKS NFL FOR ADDING ONE EXTRA WEEK THAT SCREWED THE COWBOYS... WEEK 18 MISERY.
Yes, Scooter....you embodied EVERY SINGLE VEIN POPPING EMOTION, COMMENT AND DEVASTATION that I went through between yesterday and today.  "Why do I give them so much time of my life....FOR THIS??!!!!"  I've been a Cowboys fan since I was 11 years old (early 90's) and this pretty much sums up how I feel overall.  They're my still my team but DAMN! SMH.
Bruh we always lose bc of the refs
Lmao we all saw that one woman that went viral of her face when the cowboy was losing
This is one of the most funniest videos I've seen in a while. And yes I'm a 9ers fan and I saw that game yesterday. Lol HA'HA'HA 😂😭🤣. Maybe Dallas cowboys will Do Better next year. Or not! Lol HA'HA'HA 😭🤣🤔💯💪😂
I feel your pain Bro!!😢😢
Cowboys are trash B 😂🤣😂😂
hey can you do Alabama vs. Georgia for the 2021 national championship
You do it every week, you are me in my own house. See yah next season, hopefully to not suffer again.
5:17. the answer is no.
The good news is we get to start with a practically a new team with 30 free agents.
Bruh I needed this laugh.. bc as a DC fan we hurting right now…
funnyz azz shizzzzz LMAO
Bang Bang Niner Gang!!!! We went to y’all’s hood and snatched your chains and souls! I told everyone the cowgirls are soft and we’ll prove it and we did😂🤣. That said you did a good job on this skit it’s exactly what y’all looked and sounded like.
Hey Scooter McGruder, what to feel better? Just think you could be a Patriots fabs, At least you guys fought to the last seecond, Our D didn't even showw up. Bills scored on every possession. Should Belichick retire. I think the game has passed him ny. That defebse was full of old and slow people, with busted knees and half - azz desire. Chumps with a capital C. Feel better Scooter MCGruder your misery is shared amongst all stinking teams with their loser fans. Amd yes, its coaching and JJ did not give him a  vote of confidence he said we not talking about it now, McCarthy is out. Watch. Moore isn't the one. You have to keep him at the OC. Oh. and that is a very nice tearful picture you share on Youtube. What a maroon, my man.
All I can say is DAMN!!!!!!!😭😭😭
Somewhere I can hear Stephen A cackling.
Besides the skip video this was the video i was waiting for 😂
Meanwhile, the Packers fans in Green Bay are laughing their butts off
See you Thursday. Do you want to talk about it?
Hey @ScooterMagruder look on the bright side at least Dak Prescott won the NVP!!
Diehard 9er fan here and yhis made me smile all the way thru! I've never seen you  before, but i sure fell your pain... lol. We just happened to get healthy and hot at the right time, but I was sure salty early in the season...wish ya'll some success down the road my man!
Please do the remaining teams in the playoffs
BRO WHEN THE GAME ENDED I THREW MY CHAIR AT MY DOOR AND BROKE IT COMPLETELY
NFC LEAST HONEY
Instead of throwing trash at the refs should have thrown it on Dak overpaid Prescott
Dak is such an idiot for running the ball with zero TOs 🤦 lol
That was a brutal game to watch. I think there was another flag.
What you want?!!!! 🤬🤬🤬 😶😶 I'm sorry mom 🥺🥺
Keep yo head up Scooter. Yall whipped my Football Team viciously this year.
Heart breaking loss, this is going to hurt for awhile.
Does this mean we get Scooter Gaming back sooner? Asking for a friend….
That was a fitting ending to your video.  It's so sad that I'm getting use to being disappointed..
They just lost to a better team🥱
At least you're still a grown man
I’m a 49ers fan and have been waiting for this video for ages lol.
I’m surprised he didn’t bring up the fact that Greg was the only one who did his job.
How bout dem under achieving 'Boys!!!
I feel your pain man
What kind of damn play was that at the end! 😭😭😭
As a Packers fan, I feel you when you said “maybe that’s all we can do.” I can’t wait to be disappointed in the NFC championship game ☹️
when will they learn
🤣 Bru when your show makes it to a network, stay as humble as your are, congratulations, another classic. 💣
Wana talk about it scooter?
I've been waiting for this for 24 hours lol
As a Niners fan a loved this vid, wait! No not cus Niners won but the way he viewed it. 🤷‍♂️how ever good vid I liked.  good luck next year. Let's go NINERS!!!
O line, Kellen Moore and Dak
Waiting for this video all day
Everybody remembers "The Catch" but now in 2022 we have "The Clocked Ball" 😂😂😂
Been waiting on this
That last shot, with the final piano notes... just perfect. Beautiful and sad.
I been waiting for this 😂
Hits like button to like your pain
I only watched this game just to see what you would say the following day.
Respect for putting yourself through this
Scooter at ClickBait every time his Cowboys beats a rebuilding or bad team: "The Dallas Cowboys are making The Super Bowl".  Me: I was waiting for this moment.
*WHAT... DO... YOU WANT!??"*  "...I'm sorry mom."  😆 😆 😆
😔
Heheh, go niners
I'm shocked you didn't say anything about the ref trucking Dak. Come on.......
How bout them cowboys!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣 Let's Go Rams!!!!🐏🐏🐏🐏
The difference between da and cowboys is we sucked all year. Nobody expected us to beat da goat. We weren't supposed to be there.  Dallas on the other hand had a pretty good season, and have all their star signed.They got the same amount of playoff wins we did this year 🤣🤣
@5:47, the inevitable end for the season as a cowboys fan SMH
Facts i was so sad to see them lose
Go Niners!!!!
How bout them COWBOYS!!!
"I hope he feels better...after this game" lmao
“DID WE JUST END THE GAME ON A CLOCKED BALL????!!!!” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If we resign Connor Williams, I am revoking my fandom of this team
The cowboys....if they ain't CHEATING, they're CHOKING or if they ain't CHOKING they're CHEATING...!!!  Now sit y'all Country-BAMA asses down and watch the Super Bowl with the rest of us...!!!  LOL...cowboys/ super bowl.....you need to KNOW how to operate a VCR to watch ANYTHING the cowboys DID in the playoffs.... Almost 30yrs ago!!!  I'm a GROWN MAN....and you grew up watching the cowboys NOT WIN anything...living off past glories!!!
Bro u and I were the same at the end ...my phone was blowing up with texts and emails....like haters couldn't even wait for the game to end. Hitting me up at the 2 min warning.. REALLY
Niners baby let’s go get this
I’ve honestly been waiting since September to see this video, I didn’t know who the opponent for the Cowboys was going to be, but I knew it was coming. GO BIRDS 🦅
Dak is 🗑️ take that jersey off and at least support a good player 😂😂😂
🤣
As a 49er fan, I have been waiting for this 😏😂😂
this team needs to change man, it needs real change
The closing of the laptop… I can relate to that feeling.
Don be that sad Man, they Will even make it next year.🙂
I live in New Jersey and am a home born Pats fan. I watch you every weekend and it is awesome! I actually hate the Cowboys but I love you. Thank you for an OUTSTANDING SEASON. You bleed for the the Boys and your work shows dedication to detail, commitment to excellence and the pain and heartbreak of every one of the fans of the 31 teams that don’t win the Super Bowl. My Pats just got crushed by the Bills, and I get some cathartic relief in your heartfelt streams of game time consciousness. Scooter, keep up the great work!!!
🤣🤣😅😅😂😂🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅🤣🤣😂😂😂 he gonna cry in the car
Scooter every single emotion represents everyone at my house yesterday watching that game. It sucks that the Cowboys can't do shit when it really counts. I BLAME KELLEN MOORE and to a lesser extent MIKE F@##ing MCCARTHY. Mike McCarthy I think all in all did a better job than Jason Garret, The JONES appear for the moment willing to keep him. Kellen Moore can leave and the sooner the better. I don't know about Dan Quinn, I like him and might want him to stay but know he probably won't. Lets hope we can do better next year. DC4L.
I feel your pain Scooter!!!!
As a loyal Cowboy fan as well as you are.I have to say this video was classic.
"we can't lose ive talked too much trash for this"😂😂
When you posted "The Raiders tie that game if they had Amari Cooper" I kinda hoped the Cowboys would lose lol. 🤣
When 'Greg the leg' was the only cowboy who showed up and was consistent...
5:51 that wasn't acting , poor scooter I feel your pain
I'm sorry but this is what happens when y'all spend the entire season talking trash. This is hilarious. The NFC East is trash.
That quiet, dejected, defeated, exhausted "I'm done" at the end is what finally got me to laugh One day Scooter, one day the Cowboys might win a playoff game
“WHAT DO YOU WANT!!!!” “sry mom..” Best line of the video😂
Bro when the ref ran up and respotted the ball and the time ran out.....  I EFFING LOST IT
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Every year I said we were going to lose cause that's what we do and I was 100% right, My mom (Ravens fan) told me never to count on the cowboys and she for about 26 years of my life she is right. MIke needs to go and we need a hardass coach that Jerry let's him run full autonomy this team is just disappointing thank god I am more of a Mavs than Cowboys we still have Luka.
I ain't talking to nobody at my school
May I suggest being a Bills fan for the rest of the post season? Mafia knows how you feel, but the bandwagon is open for you😉
Gotta support coach Mike. Got us to the playoffs with a ton of injuries. Need to get rid of kellen and get someone with passion that can yell at these divas.
Hey at least now Kyler Murray won't win here again!
Go Niners!!!
I feel your pain as a fellow cowboys fan
Dak is complete garbage. We grossly overpaid for an average QB that shows up small when it counts. He will finish his contract with Dallas and move on in three years and the Cowboys will have nothing to show for their $160m
At least you didn't get ****ed down by the bills the way the patriots did. That's a rivalry.
Love it - Signed, a 49ers fan.
Jerry , you running out of time. Choose wisely what comes next jerra
Scooter, I am in so much pain. This is the best team we've seen since the 90s and we STILL couldn't do ANYTHING! Every time we get a soft schedule, we get first in the divison, taken out by the divisonal round, and then roasted the next year by team that actually deserved to win their division because they're actually good. What are we supposed to do next year against the Bucs, Titans, Bengals, Rams, and Packers? This type of foolishness is the exact reason the NFC East hasn't seen a repeating division champ since 2003-2004. Why are we constantly settling for mediocrity???
This man....making me re-feel. The hurt is deep.
Well....bunch of penalties, clock management, ceedee one catch, delusional Dallas huh???? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔💣💥🔥🤎💙🧡💚💛🖤❤🤍💜💖🏈🏉🏈🏉🏈🏉
Yep, as a Packers fan, that was definitely a McCarthy coached playoff game
The penalties Legit hurt y’all unfortunately, I mean 14 penalties? That was just unbelievable, unfortunately the wide receivers wanna miss the catches and Dak Prescott didn’t give the ball to the ref in time for them to have a Hail Mary throw
Barry McCockiner was right about Dak and the Cowgirls
I feel your pain brotha, I fell your pain. Damn Cowboys!
"is this how eagles fans felt earlier because this is ridiculous"
Legit, Tony Romo is the best commentator in the NFL. The refs did get the heck out of there pretty fast.
3 more years of this and Scooter will stop being hopeful for any seasons 10 more years for Apathy 20 and he probably stop being a fan
HOW BOUT THEM DALLAS COWGIRLS   LOL
Cowboy Fans ya want a good team... STOP BUYING TICKETS! STOP GIVING JERRY YOUR MONEY! What him step down in a heartbeat and let the team get fixed.
RIP
27 years and counting 😂😂  Next video a few months from now  This is our year cowboys winning the Super Bowl
0:10 shots fired at troy aikman
Why did the Cowboys lose?
I hope the 49ers run the table.  It prolly won't happen but if it does it will make the loss sting a whole lot more and I think the Cowboys need that sting. Go beg Jimmy Johnson to become the GM and Jerry fire himself.  Fire McCarthy because he aint it.  Let Moore go as his play calling stagnated and there is no running game.  That will break the curse.
Only scooter Magruder can make an angry face silly… LOL
This video is so accurate after the lose
Lmao the stare at the end lol
Americas Football team 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
No mention about running a play before the two minute warning?? Most pissed I was all game. And also, hard to blame Cedric Wilson for that 4th down. And also, no mention of Kellen Moore? Besides penalties Moore is why they lost. Dude was terrible for the majority of the game
Definitely waited on this let's go 9ers!!!
The NY Giants will always get the last laugh. YOU GET WHAT YOU FUCKING DESERVE COWBOYS!!! hehehehe hahahaha!!
That look at 5:52 was me yesterday. Bruh I'm fuckin done 😂😂☠️
See what happens when you talk Superbowl and you have nothing to back it up? Cry Homer cowboys fans.
I'm sorry your team lost, but I'm not sorry the Cowboys lost!
Look, I don't know why people aren't talking about this that much but I think they would've had a chance to clock it if the red didn't get in the way of everyone in the end, and I'm not even a Cowboys fan
YO SCOOTER YALL STILL THEM BOYZ? 😂
MAKE IT, BAKE IT, AND TAKE IT LIKE A MAN!!!!!
I almost felt bad for you in that last scene...almost. Thanks for making me smile. Love, an Eagles fan
This game hurt my soul
Jimmy wanted to give yall the game too.
No discipline or accountability
Watch every week! Best video yet, but also not wanting the end! Might be the most positive thing out of this week!   Going to be a hard few months……  Great job Scooter!
I was at that game
Cowgirls going to Cowgirls
I was waiting on this all day.  Worth it.
Still better than the Magic
Everybody hates your team, lol.  It doesn't matter if their team lost too or wasn't in the playoffs to begin with.  Love your reacts!!  GO STEELERS!!
Man, blame the fans including yourself. We winning the Super Bowl this year or it's our year this year. Look there's a simple reason, sports always need to be a teams that will always fails when it count. Ladies and gentlemen, The Dallas Cowboy.
Best of the worst and worst of the best.
We got next season
Scooter screaming is still better than Trubisky as NVP
A
Im just gonna say this now Cowboys fans but even if yall would’ve won, yall would’ve lost to the Goat Tom Brady next week.
"WHAT DO YOU WANT!" "sorry mom". 😂😂
Therapists in Dallas are gonna have a field day
I can’t wait for Nfl therapy to come back, I get the feeling Scooter is going to put way more emotion than before for the cowboys this time
Sorry Bro.
Too bad y’all can’t play the Football Team every week
we love you buddy, even tho you apparently love hurting yourself via the cowboys <3
As an Eagles fan, that just cheered me up! 😂😂😂
I may be upset but scooter’s videos make me feel better
How bout them cowboys?
"We can't lose this game, I talked too much trash."  Oh, how we all can relate to that statement.
Cowboys fans will be in depression for the next year at least as a giants fans I got to experience 2 Super Bowls. Wish the cowboys best of luck next year.
Click bait is gonna be fun this week
We’re never going to win another super bowl
You represented my feelings well
No mention of the Nickelodeon broadcast??? DID WE JUST END THE GAME ON A CLOCKED BALL ?
🤣🤣🤣 like Stephen A. Smith say just wait accidents waiting to happen
Smoking that scooter pack. 😮‍💨
The ref didn’t move at the end of the game
Says the eagles are garbage yet Dallas lost in a much worse way.  I don’t understand how the cowboys are so garbage in the playoffs, after watching the eagles game I was frustrated.  But after seeing Dak scramble with 14 seconds left and lose like that I felt much better.  so that means that THE COWBOYS ARE HEALING EAGLES FANS SUFFERING.
Cowboys Vs. Cowboys fr
Haven’t watched yet but excuses incoming
this is the video I was waiting for
Respect on being able to make this vid so quick
Condolences to Scooter & Papa Grossi.
My favorite part was when he said "nobody talk to me for 24 hours", knowing that Tom Grossi called him immediately after
Stephen A Smith roasted Dallas today and it was glorious especially all the fans crying lmao
This was me the entire game
Glad to see you posted 💪🏾
That Jerry Jones line!!! LMAO.... OmG!! Lol!!!
Pain
McCarthy needs to go. Elliot and Dak need to be put in backup while we draft a competent quarterback and Hardy replaces Elliot. I'm sorry. They're not what they used to be. We also need to work on these penalties and we need better linemen on both offence and defence.
Hopefully not the last time to ask if vander esch is playing
Say it ain't so ooo
How about Dem Cowboys 🤠😂😭
PAIN. Misery if you will
😫
Y’all are season champs. One and done in the playoffs forever and ever and ever and ever and ever. Fuck the Cowboys
Did the cowboys win the super bowl?
How bout them One and Done COWBOYS!!!
Man i was just like that
As a cowboys fan I'm so disappointed in the team this year we have so much potential just to throw it away Dak is Romo 2.0 we're not going to see a championship with this dude we got to dump him fast. And the head coach too!!!!
Everyone: "I feel like Zuerlein is gonna cost us this game with missed kicks. Ends up being the only player to play well. Go figure.
Do you think the Cowboys are gonna make the Superbowl this year? No way jose! What a heartbreaker! Better luck next year Cowboys!
Yea, The Colt's choked against The Jaguars.   But..........Ouff.
But I thought they couldn’t lose 🤨
emotional damage
Ahhh...finally
WE CLINCHED THE PLAYOFFS FOR NOTHING
Do you want to talk about it 😃
Hahaha WHAT DO YOU WANT… sorry mom lol
Ah....bliss
NINERSSSSS
SMOKIN THAT COWBOYS PACK
NINER fan but Put some respect on Dak Prescott's name we would kill to have a guy like Dak.
As a notre dame fan I can relate
Cowboys fans ……Have a nice vacation.
The Hard Knox curse strikes again.
As a wise man said: "Remember when in spider man the clock tower collapsed. Still better clock management than Mike McCarthy."
What do you want!   Sorry mom. Lmao
Do you want to talk about it Scooter?
I'm disgusted. Jerry Jones keeps toying with fans passion and love for the team, Mike McCarthy is absolutely garbage as HC, and Dak is overrated (records and stats made in games against shit-tier teams.) The only consistently good players this year were Micah Parsons, Tony Pollard and Dalton Schultz. Even Trevon Diggs sucks at everything else besides catching INTs. I'm fucking tired.
the penalties was wild this game. Honestly being a Steelers fan at least you weren’t blown out by 21 points, I mean our downfall was expected, yours was just plain funny.
Dallas can't blame the refs, only can blame thm self. CHOKE like thy alwys do in the playoffs CHOKEBOYS alwys lose under pressure n in big games
Dallas Cowboys outscored 49ers 10-7  second half and  still manage to lose the game 🤣🤣🤣
I was waiting for this video! 🤣🤣🤣
14 penalties...
As a Colt's fan;  The Cowboys and The Steelers are who knew they were. And they got us off the hook!
Im just gonna say this now Cowboys fans but even if yall would’ve won, yall would’ve lost to the Goat Tom Brady next week.
I think the refs just threw another flag against cowboys during the rams game
So.......Mike McCarthy, huh?
The cowboys are who we thought they were🤣🤣 #gochiefs
I'm a niners fan it was a good game
BYE BYE DALLAS
See you on Clickbait sports this Thursday!!! You better not be hiding after all that shit talking you did this year!!!
That's rough buddy😔
Its okay cowboys fans . ima do a super rebuild for yall ! i got this !!
#DakCheats
Bruh…
Despite what's happened the last 5 years, the Giants statistically had the most success of all the NFC EAST teams this century.
Just be happy to not be a Bears fan
Tough scenes all around Scooter.
Y'all them Boys in a Man's game😂😂😂
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS!!!!
Greg didn't even have the chance to disappoint us. The rest of the team did it for him
How bout them cowboys
pain.
The Cowboys can’t even rule the Dallas sports world anymore they just get by on nostalgia
As a Niners fan, it was a hard fought game from both sides; good season ya'll
The Cowboys fans ran in the stadium like it was a Travis Scott concert  Then they left it like one😂 (Travis fan, btw)
Just be happy that your team didn't lose to the Jags with a playoff berth on the line
I bet so much money with my friends on this game and I lost. This happens every year,
Scooter is a grown man
I DO NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
