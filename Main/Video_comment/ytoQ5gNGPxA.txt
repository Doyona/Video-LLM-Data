It's simple...'just get rid of the turds' 😂😂
Martial iz the best
That Barcelona super chat has more holes than swiss cheese. Needs calling out.
The other day I googled Marcus Rashford stats by season and did the same with Mo Salah. Then I googled their contracts. This data embodies everything wrong with this club. We pay premium pay for half the production.
Manchester who? Ulighted
hey mark the comment 'this seasons dead'(,2/11/2023)"keep ETH, work on next summer and next season" .most sensible approach.  brilliant.
What's stopping Ten Hag from putting these players on the bench? You have pellistri, Garnacho,  Casemiro, Onana, Amrabat, Holjlund, Antony, Mainoo, Reguilon. And these are enough to create a core
Spot on Mark!
First 4 mins - Goldbridge managed to repeat one thing and stretch it our over 4 mins. Talent. Annoying talent
It's not even the players! Why are players sh*t when they're here but decent enough for us to buy them before United and a lot of them thrive after coming here! The players are a problem, then they leave and somehow there's still a problem.  Pogba is gone, Ronaldo is gone, how are we any better? Maybe this is what Sancho meant by scapegoating.  It's not the players and it's not the manager because both those have been changed in some shape or form before and the issues in the team have not...
Marcus Rashford- the mist overhyped english player at the moment
Moanbridge
The club need's to stop giving out massive contracts. We have been signing and nurturing mercenaries for far too long. Sell every player over the age of 26 plus Rashford, Sancho, Anthony and have a proper reset with a four year plan to build a squad with talent and the right mentality to challenge. The board needs to change its attitude too. Football should always be their first priority.
blah! blah! blah! blah!
when you can see the formation.....it is the players........when they play like  strangers...it is coaching...Manager!!!!
You know United have problems when Martial is Joel Glazer's favourite player. I mean, how? Why? Does he maybe fancy him sexually? JG certainly knows nothing about football or footballers and yet he is heavily involved in transfers.
WITH TEN HAG ALL THE WAY
The GLAZERS are winning the Fans are weak
Open heart surgery!!!!!!!!!!❤
Mark-Can You Pls list the Titles of Arnold,Murtogh,Flecther  Pls
Varane is my favourite United player, I'd be devastated if he's not involved because of a fallout with ETH.
For months I've said playing R'ford/Antony is making us Weaker as they are Lazy & dont track back & help full backs or close oppos down & Dont cross for any C.F. so Why does EtH keep picking them & Why does Erik play bruno out wide when he can Score..but not wide out Wide & teams are cottoning on that you can play round Dalot-as city/geordies did..but team pattern wasnt changed & it was in front of where Erik was sat..like him but his tactits,on match days,shud be Shown to us, when its not going to plan..or is this a Dutch mgrs ploy as LVG never did..cos he told them how to do it in training..Well Wake up & CHANGE cos pep does & it works !!
you say anthony isn’t the problem but five minutes ago you said it’s the players that are the problem???? you talk nonsense.. like a dog chasing it’s tail this.. 😂😂😂😂😂
ten hagg said post match that there isn’t much training going on.. with two games a week that’s not a surprise , but it opens up the question that mistakes aren’t being rectified in training sessions as there isn’t the time.. so hard to improve when you are shoved into the next match build up…
Well said mark.  Keep up the good job💪❤️
After years of attacking individual players this unfortunately happens.
I'm going to talk to Manchester United should win 😊
I think all his signings have been ok but Anthony is a wild one I can’t believe that there’s a player worth £80 million and he is so one sided and can’t use his right foot  Club needs to bin all the other duds asap
Get rid of the turd! New club motto?
Manchester Uniturd
The thing with Ten Hag is, he wanted DeJong and then signed Mount. Kovacic was better, or even Maddison if he needed an English player. Thats inexcusable
4/5 players need to go and 6 need to come
How much of the 400M was spent on the players he’s wanted?  He’s been told no for his foes choices numerous times!
My concern with Ten Hag is that his big plan was to bring in Frankie De Jong and rebuild his Ajax team around him. Without De Jong this plan doesn't seem to work. Hence his comments about not being able to play the Ajax way.
We need to sack the players
No one wants to buy our players and we are broke so we can't kick them out.  We literally have no option other than find some one that can get something out of the players we have.  The Glazers are staying regardless so none of this will change or improve.  Only option is a new manager now that Ten Hag lost the dressing room.
Not In mgires case what drugs are u on 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
What about getting rid of the players 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔😡😡😡😡
Why dies Goldbridge always stick up for Antony? Seriously I think Goldbridge needs new glasses
Man United should go after the one man who embodies positive mentality and understands the psychology of sport.   Claudio Ranieri.
I wont be renewing MUTV.
How much better was Wayne Rooney than Marcus Rashford?  Rooney would always sacrifice himself for the club.  Sure there's pressure and more pressure when you go it alone.  Start being a team player and maybe the preesure won't feel as big.
spot on mark. i think the bigger picture of the politics in this country is reflected in the media , football or otherwise..
We couldve got mitoma, but got Anthony for 90mil
It has always been my opinion that its the players who should be the ones to go and not the manager
Who needs to get turfed out at United…?
If you can accept the glazers staying you can survive them firing eth. So stop with the over reaction Goldbridge. This club is already fucked. Why worry when you can sing. 😂
We need to get another game canceled
Goldbridge that's your opinion. There are fans like me who are fans way longer than you and we're  not in agreement with you. So fucking accept it.
Big uo ten hag the players are looking for excuses when injurec players get bk some of deadwood need to go in january fact
Manager makes bad  substitutions decisions, brings lots of weak players; there is no style in his game at all; the team looks every game worse nothing is changed
Hi mark I totally agree with you  why sack the manager it's the players we need to get rid of
Ronaldo told us we never back him…ten hag is a stubborn manager…man united is big club need some1 who is ppl person to run the dressing room.bias manager won’t work!
Mark does not go to natches like we do so it’s not the same .
“Turd in the bath” analogy is absolutely hilarious yet depressing at the same time! That’s exactly what’s been happening these past ten years at Utd. Great analogy, I’m going to steal that , can be used for many of life’s quandaries albeit quite frustrating that it’s really apt for Utd situation. Need to stay the course with EtH and hope things change above
Ten hag is not the man for the job sorry mark….
id say. if we lose to Luton Town or even draw. ETH is done...
seems like alot of people in the chat are missing the issue. United are no longer a football club, they are a sports marketing agency. Until ownership changes, don't expect something different. What will help the fans in the interim is finally admit to yourselves that you are no longer a top club in Europe. Being self aware is the first step to fixing this issue.
I will always back ETH, get rid of the deadwood!!!
Mark I've been telling you for the last few years that most of these players that have been here for a long time like Rashford, Martial, Mctominay and McGuire need to be let go and replaced.
Selling the likes of Rashford and McTom makes sense as that would be pure profit to use on new players.
Someone please Explain the rumours bout varane??
Martial hardly plays and when does gets no service but yeah martial is lazy and doesn’t preform.
Wht the hell r we gonna do w Peggy Sue? And favouring him has also cost us Sancho. stoopid. shouldn't hv been allowed initially. or to continue.
Whys nobody piling up on Chelsea
Oh and I miss Fred too
It’s times like this I miss Fellani and Weghorst!
Very old Trafford full of holes full of deluded fans.
Sacking José was United’s biggest mistake. Mourinho was the last manager that the players ran for, not cause they wanted too but because he demanded it.
Buying Mount was crazy.
The best manager for Man United is Sergio Conceição from the Portuguese Porto team. He can win titles with the players that he have.
keep ten hag ..........get rid rashford Anthony and a lot more that think they are special
I really can't understand the call to sack Ten Hag.... has everyone forgot about Sir Alex in his early years 🤬🤬🤬🤬and what eventually happened... come on to get the sort of success that Man United deserve means backing and trusting the manager is vital... you cannot demand overnight success that only happens in dreams.... I bet that if Ten Hag is given the support and financial help he needs he will make things right 🎊🌟🤩🥳
It’s a repeating cycle!!
Why aren't journalists asking Ten Hag in press conferences what is the style of play and if the style of play is not recognizable or is not present how do we fix that issue?
Don't bring foreign arguments into football.
If you weren’t so arrogant you would’ve looked at Ange Postecoglu, imagine what he’d be doing.
Goldbridge,  do you think pep or klopp would allow rasford to be shooting from fucking 30 yards?
united looking more and more like the next Everton
I miss C
If there is a fallout with Verane we know what’s coming next.. we don’t sort this out..he’ll be off..
No matter who comes in, they're not performing.  This runs deeper than the players but the Manager and coaches are responsible for geting the best out of the players so you can't blame a big collective of players without indirectly blaming the manager going by that logic.
This is the most logic decision mark
Erik has his players. Why is martial on your thumbnail when he hasn’t even been playing? You’re so toxic.
Man are a commercial business model .. a brand which is not the case with other clubs .. player sponsorship social media .. that’s why they pay those salaries.  You can’t change the business model of man United .
Great points here
Ten Hag getting what he deserves after disrespecting Ronaldo
yes because not signing todibo had forces ten hag to play a 4-1-5 formation with no style, just hit and hope you get on end of it
We have lazy players .
But example you pick on the two players were played the least this season. Rather than point out the players, what are the problem this season?.  Martial has played well this season, apart from last night with no service. If it was new striker, you’d be saying graveyard.
Ralf Rangnick left because he knew what BS this club is and he wasn't going to be listened too. Players are not pulling their weight. Glazers are a bunch of a**holes. But, let's just sack the manager.....so dumb!!!
Sacking T'en hag would be the worse mistake of United, worse then the departure of DeGea
Finally you mentioned a really important point, with a great analogy, that "ETH out" fans keep missing for some reason. Yes, a lot of turds keep getting far more time at the club, than any of the recent managers and filthy water corrupts everything in it eventually, but there is one thing you are still missing Mark, - Rashford IS ONE OF THOSE TURDS! People keep forgetting, that he is a serial bottler! Stop protecting him, he has done nothing to justify any fan's loyalty, other than being a youth academy player and that makes his case even worse in my opinion, becouse his mentality, mindset, attitude and desire is disgraceful for a "born and bred" United player. A lot of those players just got too comfortable, too familiar with loosing, with giving up and that is the most dangerous thing, they now have a know how of surviving the storm of their own making. Ten Hag must survive this!
En hag needs to kick ass start throwing things aroind tje changing room
CR7 . Harry , Sancho did this to ETH . He is a very good coach but not a manager and unable to handle big ethos .  Hire Roberto De Zerbi who has proven displaying amazing even with average players  His box midfield and pressing is futuristic. ETH need good ball playing players to execute his plan. Glazers will never give that to him . He is set for failure by Glaziera
Blah Blah Blah Sancho
Mark, you are hundred percent right and all these people Erik ten Hag needs to go haven’t got a clue, The manager can only do so much the rest is up to the players
ETH.. style of play?  Bemused what that is..
I’m sick to death if the ETH OUT lot.  They don’t have a clue.😩🤦🏻‍♂️
Can’t polish a turd, get these players out, glazers out
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Long may Uniteds insanity continue
ETH has his favourite players who he keeps playing who have no form .. that’s down to ETH on the pitch ..
Our recruitment was so bad that ETH arrived and nobody had a clue who to buy…. So ETH tried to help out buy all he knows are Cloggie League players and they are a level below what’s needed  Wot a mess 😄
From the First game against Wolves to last night's games against Newcastle, this team simply doesn't run. With the ball they don't run to create space, without the ball they don't run to close space or track runners. Their simply too lazy and overpaid and don't put any effort in. If were ever going to rebuild properly, getting rid of lazy players on ridiculous wages should be at the top of the list
Mark he just not good enough eth out
I'm KEEP TEN HAG..... Get rid of the crap players.  I know it's very difficult to push players out. But get rid of Martial, Rashford and ( add your own players). We need to get rid of the deadwood.   We need to do more than rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic .
Bro you are the best good thinking
Players needs to take accountability for once in their bloody lives at this football club. Please do not sack Ten Haag. It will only make the club go back another 5 years or more. Do the right thing, get rid of the players who are disinterested, take the losses and start afresh with a manager who will coach players that want to be coached
Why do people keep commenting about ten haag spending 400 million... he doesnt negotiate transfers thats the bloody club 😂😂
Has to be supported he’s spent over 300 million on garbage calls sancho out yet plays Antony week in week out who does nothing week after week ten hag as been found out got lucky last year with spurs and Liverpool been bad
Mark finally!! I’ve been saying that to my friends and family work mates for a long time
McGuire , martial , mctomanay , varane , lindalof all need to go
But how can we get rid of the Glaziers, when they dont want to sell
The players are refusing to play his way. We play nothing like Ajax did. Except we pass it around but we do it randomly for no reason.
I don't often comment but this time I will. I see all these wanting Ten Hag gone! But who do you replace him with? And where does the funds come from? United struggled to get Amrabat over the line and there for struggle to pay at Ten Hag off. Then not mentioned their is a compensation fee for a manager should he be at a club. Then you are still stuck with these players who just aren't good enough and just don't understand what it is to wear a United shirt. Unfortunately the issues at this club start all the way at the top and works it all the way down. Glazers are just leeches the recruitment process has been poor and the players are just as bad. While this is happening at United its going to be a struggle get the new players at United to steady as sinking ship!!! This club needed a full takeover to re structure the club!
Bruno needs to go
Did you think of this in the bath Mark?
Ten hag works with shackles on
Best show I've seen from The United Stand!
Bring Fergie back!
We're done under this ownership 😢
Christ.... Don't say Olé again.... My heart stopped hahaha.
What if Sancho is telling the truth??
I believe he thinks that he nothing to apologize for
Sack eth not good enough as man u coach this is man u not ajax,, some player need to go
He has been supported, you was the guy telling people they were Glazer supporters for wanting Poch! At least Poch has a style - if only people at Chelsea could score, the comparison would then be night & day.
I think the point with the 400 million pounds may be that even with half of the mentioned quota of 1b spent there are close to no players in that squad worth keeping. Mark himself said that none of the current players would play in a city or a liverpool side. You can count the talent worth keeping at that club on a single hand.
Remember when united fans were begging the owners to get Pogba, sancho, amrabat, bruno and so many others. They got all of them and still fans are complaining they didn't get de jong or gakpo or someone else. This is not a player problem or even a manager problem. Something unseen is wrong at the club. The players have been changed and the managers have been changed yet everything remains the same.
Based on performance, will Ten Hag last one season at Real Madrid or Barcelona? You're just lowering Manchester United's standard by accepting failure. To be honest, no player has improved during Ten Hag's as manager.
Love the 💩🛁reference 😂
To me it’s so clear that United were motivated by the hope of a sale last season. That’s gone, Ratcliffe somehow ransacks the clubs future, and now the fans want to somehow deflect this mess onto the manager and not the Glazers? We are exactly what we deserve because we can’t stomach being mediocre.  The truth needs to settle. We are a middle table, cup club.
He inherited a squad full of dross and then bought more dross to go with it.
Pep also bought lots of flops like Nolito and Bravo.  The issue is that we don't get rid of flops
Couldnt agree more on who does and doesn't absolutely need to go. It starts with the players. Rangnick said this team needs open heart surgery and the more time goes on, the more he's been proven right!
Why should we support a grumpy poisoness person as ETH?!?! No good, OUT
👏👏...fully agree with the Mark"s stance..i standy by Ten Hag no matter what the result is..He ahould be given minimum 4 years to be judged and kick out the players he doesnt want
Robbo needed x
player power ON THE PITCH please
I bet Ollie's having a rye smile to himself
Always play Garnacho with Rasmus
Man utd will not do anything this season with ten hag .
This guy thought all the previous managers have to go but now suddenly thinks he has a big insight. Your players arent leaving. So might as well get Ole back and coax them to try for a season or two 😂😂
The moment all the deadwood came in the leaks start to appear. They should be removed along with the high paid non performing players.
Why did Erik start martial yawn yawn before Rasmus
I'm convinced Mark and bruno aka the fraud are best buddies,the man won't have a bad word said against him 😅
I have to agree with Mark on this topic. Great show!
Does Ten Haag have the desire to fight for better days, or is he also resigned to the enormity of the task ? The only reason that could lead to his replacement is if he no longer believes in the project himself.
Never fails to amaze me how Goldbridge will bang on about City "buying things" yet united consistently outspend them!
We cannot support a delusional manager. He’s just not picking the right team.
Great work Mark I've been saying this on different channels and people are still defending the players and blaming the manager. The only thing I have to say about Ten Hag is that he doesn't give players a chance to prove themselves I.e van de beek, pelistri, garnacho, hanable
De zerbi wouldn't stand for players sulking. He would get them out the club! Or he would walk himself!
Glazers out, Sir Jim out, now players out... The mental gymnastics and delusion is insane.
Man United would swallow Graham Potter whole
Fantistac 🤣🤣
TEAM UNITED LACKS POSITIONING SENSE - FOOTBALL BASICS
Those Varane rumours are terrifying. The fall into a mid table club is heart breaking.
Mourinho is available from the end of the season
He signed a bunch of these players, they’re his bunch. 7 of them, coincidentally, are represented by the agency that represents Ten Hag.
Thats nonsense you talking,he brought 14 players in so why his still playing those you talking about,14 players is more than a team,what is wrong with you 2+2=4 no matter how you look at it,from above ,from below,from the side it's still 4.
Mark you are right , Jadon should care about the club, and probably look at the fans, but you talk from a position of never being in that circumstance, i don't think its as easy to say Jadon should kiss another mans ass figuratively , we are men , EGO exists in our Nature
It is a miracle if any of Bruno's passes reach our players and it is a miracle if Rashford passes to anyone inside the box. These are two players Ten Hag is counting on and this is why I dont have much hope unless Ten Hag decides to drop them.
ETH might not be the man for the job but certainly the players are not up to united standards.
I think Ten hag is very inexperienced in the premiere league and undervalued the quality of football played in English premiere league brang a load of players over from eredivisie thinking they could just turn up and do their tricks and flicks and they are getting battered physically and mentally theirs no easy games in premiere league every game is a contest its brutal theirs no room for errors. Ten hag is learning the hard way.
he bought the wrong players
I wish we'd have focused on carabao 🤦
Ten got to go he’s not got a F clue playing 7 at the back every game don’t attack signings donkeys he’s got to GO
Thanks Mark, for being the voice of reason
Ten Hag deserves better than United. Sacking him would be doing him a favour.
Ten Hag will go to another top club and will be great. The club hierarchy are too ambiguous and sketchy and their lack of transparency is leading to uncertainty. Whether it was to Jassim or Jim the sale or non sale should have been sorted out by now. The Glazers are doing what they usually do and the fans are falling for it again. We are turning on the manager instead of keeping our focus on the real problems at Utd. The players will also improve once we have some clarity on our future.
And we all laughed and mocked van gaal when he told ten hag to stay away from commercial brand called manchester united because its not a football club anymore
This is the same person who said Ole is at the wheel 😂
Mark just doesnt want to admit his 1st choice in manager just isnt good enough. Hes brought in players and hasnt got the best out of even them. Bring someone in that has a track record of improving players, then start shipping players out when they dont perform. MArk just wants ETH to stay because he fought for him so strongly and doesnt wont to be proven wrong and make it look like he doesnt know what hes talking about
On hindsight ETH success last year was really bad for the club because it ket the value of the club that Glazers want.
I don’t get why they want to sack him so quick it’s only his 2nd season
Turdgate
The players need to learn some respect and know their role. Its as simple as that
Antony is also a mistake lol. Weghorst was a mistake too even if it was a free loan!
Ronaldo was the escape goat  Paul Pogba a escape goat  Sancho now the escape goat  Who is next ?
Rashford is everything wrong with the club
Eric Ten Crap
Arnold, Murtaugh and Fletcher are all dysfunctional.
They are all a lot of misfits included ten hag and wally with the brolly   all looked like they didn't want to be at the club I can't back ten hag he does not know what he his doing  lost the plot    all down hill now no faith
Players out.
The board is to be blamed for bad recruitment
Your telling us things we already know this is not news just going around in circles
Players we have now dictate the way we play. ETH is right to admit he cant play like in Ajax if he cant clear the decks.
Gonna be tough for Ten Hag tbh, looks like the players turn on him. In every sport, the manager rarely escape. Its less costly to sack one man, than to sack 12 players
Be silent about the sancho thing man, that silly manager tried to throw jaden under the bus and got mad that it backfired. Just because you have a mentality to be a robot and have no morals for yourself as a man don’t get on to others for sticking up for themselves, id never say sorry either if I didn’t feel I was in the wrong are u crazy. I agree with a lot of stuff u do say mark but cut it out with that sancho talk. Lastly we do need a coach that sticks with a style no matter what and takes players out the line up that don’t listen. What we’re seeing on the pitch tactically is not the glazers, some of eth choices has been ludicrous, it’s that simple. We should simultaneously get rid of the coach and bring in the right profile of manager like Tottenham did and address and put pressure on the clubs structure.
United will probably fight for relagation battle end of the season
Mark what the hell are you talking about what the hell did Sancho do nothing wrong so why does he have to apologize the manager used him as a escape goat. The manager is at fault not him
Bring a nee manager now And they'll play well for one Year, make top 4 and revert to theur usual bad self in the second year, we start asking for the managers head and yhr cycle continues
Mark don’t forget all the players that ETH signed aren’t performing as well 🧐
If it looks like a dog, smells like a dog, barks like a dog, then perhaps it just may be a DOG!  Ten Hag just may not be good enough Eddie Howe got stuck with a relegation side he coached them out of trouble and into Europe.  Its called bloody good Coaching and Ten Hag has not got it in him   ...........  end of.
Idk why so many people are so delusional thinking a new manager would do good with this team lol
who is going to buy them ,,,ffs they see what we see ,they are shite.
Why you have to shout? I need to turn volume down which affects me getting my notifications later in the day.
The wallpaper AND the curtains wow ,you have some class mate .lololol
Have a great SALE! SALE! and go on with the willing players and academy players
Players are a joke, they'll sack pep as manager amd klopp and assistant. How many managers will they saxk before you know they're the problem?
Give your alternative on “getting rid of players”… on big wages and long contracts ? Come on clever lad
I love watching how delulu mark is. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WILL BUY MAN UTD PLAYERS + PAY THEIR ENORMOUS SALARIES MARK? Have you gone mad
He wanted Mount n was delivered in no time but he is warming the bench, Antony Garnacho is starting ahead of him, Hojlund he can't even play for 90min. Why buy players if u can't use them?
What the thing is your club is no longer a big club... Yous are where you are because you belong there fact was only a great club because of one man that simple now just a mid-table team
We get new. Manger. It’s gonna  Be the same  thing
The turd story is great!
Turd United
Nothing wrong with voting for Britex
This guy has the biggest Rashford gender and he is talking about people having agender
Martial will leave for free
Do player contracts have a penalty for awful performance? If so, these players defo need not be paid for the week.
Did anyone really think we’d beat Newcastle I certainly didn’t I reckon Luton could probably beat us
Hearing people yesterday chanting "ETH out!" made me wonder if I still wanted to be a part of it. Club is dying, fans are dumb, there's only endless suffering. The worst part is that only United and my national team keep me going with football, which was always a big part of my life. Losing it would be a great pity.  Btw. Fans Forum is so bad, I lost all my respect for them. I will stick only with you Mark from now on.
DIRTY.YOUTUBER
Klopp won the league by spending 450mil (raughly, as much as Ten Hag has spent)... so United should have at least be competitive for top4 if we take into account the player price inflations of the last few seasons.
Sheesh!!! Mark went OFF. I love it.
I WANT SOLSKJIAER
Get ETH some help, he's not equipped enough to choose who we buy while coaching the team. I wish the Glazers might go now but that won't happen until they suck the blood out the club and nothing is left. Nothing is aligned at this club + 0 structure
How did all these ‘moments players’ finish 3rd and reach two finals last season?
OUT TEN HAAG, FERNANDES MARTIAL RASHFORD DALOT REGUILLON
I hope ten hag gets the sack just because i wabt to see this fool after his condesending behaviour
Spot on.....man
I can't see any good manager going to man u now its a poison chalice
OH MY FXXXXX GOD. STILL TALKING ABOUT DEGEA. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
All the numpties in the chat, never played the game, obviously. I'm with you Mark.
I'm backing ten hag but I'm telling u now ole at the wheel by Xmas glazers out
Keep calling the players out mark. It's been happening for years now. The players cannot be allowed to get away from this yet again.
People should realize manchester united is not an attractive prospect for any new player for the future how tf are we going to sack eric ten hagg when it clear he is the reason we are been looked on by players
You claimed to like Rashford, but every time you are constantly on the guy's back! You said Bruno didn't play last night, and so did Rashford.
Some players are the problems they knew how the club and mainly fans desperate for honors  and took united for a good ride by themselves and their agents  actually whole team with the board went for good ride and these some players jumped off at the bus stop  and left others for that long ride
If man utd decide to sack eric ten hag...i want carrick to become our next manager...
You are delusional when it comes to ETH
RAGNICK IS THE BEST THING HAPEN SINCE SAF HAS GONE
RON ATKINSON 💥👽💥👽💥👽🏐🥅⚽🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love the fact that Mark thinks his opinion is so important that players and management at United actually take any notice to what he has to say 😂😂😂
You can not get every manager their own set of players, do you know how costly that has been for us? What you need to figure out is a style of football we want to play, get players suited for that syle, as well as manager(s) that play close to that style. All this comes down to the DOF. We need a DOF asap!!
United needs rich ownership. Qatar have left. Game over. This team will win nothing
Players on stupid wages who can't be asked to play for the badge. GTFOH!
Totally agree mark no point sacking our manager just to go round in this full circle again
Major heart surgery required👺
Trust the process      😂
MARK GOLDBRIDGE  TO BE MAN UTD MANAGER- I DEMAND IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Quote from Andy Cole. "Some players are just playing for themselves''.  Yeah ,  you listening Marcus???
Casemiro’s form (and fitness) seems to have fallen off a cliff. Bad long-term deal. Martinez, I agree. Eriksen is a great footballer, but doesn’t have the legs, Hojlund looks like he will be good, but he’s not ready. Antony, I think, has been awful. Onana — the jury’s out. Mount — what’s that about? I don’t see where he fits into the first XI.
Very good point Mark is saying  like Ragnick said 12 players has to be changed
So ralf, Jose and now Erik are to strict. Is it not these players are to soft?
United  in championship
I don’t think ten hag did himself any favours since saying that we’ll never play like Ajax because in truth that is the reason why the fans wanted him because we wanted a better style of football that can compete with the best clubs in Europe. I understand he might not have the right characteristics of players but that’s where you sign the right characteristics of players, which in some areas he has and that’s where he contradicts himself. Ultimately I don’t think ten hag is the problem but I’m surprised he ever took the job if he was never going to be able to play his style of football.
Because utd put them on massive contracts and u can't get rid of them lol😅😅
Why should Ten Hag get more players he wants when the ones he got are crap?
Manchester United the only club that has erectile dysfunction.
18:53 absolutely fantistac 😂
The turd in the bath anecdote is classic Goldbridge
We need to get rid of the players to get the best out of the manager. Not get rid of the manager to get the best out of these players for the 4th time.
I support Liverpool since 5 that was during 1996, even though Liverpool didnt win the Premier League, we play poorly finish 8th and 7th with players like jay spearing, paul konchesky, but we didnt play as poor as this United team this season.... This team is worst than Ole, Mourinho, LVG, Ralfgnick and D.M.     In Liverpool, we always turn to Steven Gerrard and S.Hyypia but in this united team i dont know the fans can relies on who...
Emery no thanks.
The turd will dissolve before the second full tub.
It's about Ronaldo KARMA on Erik Ten Hag........The Club (OT) has to write or say "sorry" openly to Christiano.
GET RID OF THE TURD
The manager has no backbone when it comes to getting rid of player so he can’t use that excuse AWB epitomises this
Next week if Rashford scores fans be like he is a decent player, same goes for Magurie and so on.  If we loose next week its the manager.  Our club needs to start from the structure to recruitment based on the style of play.  But heres the thing we always say a win is a win when we get a win but forget about that. What is the style of play ? What are we trying to do with the ball ? The most crucial thing right now is to show what kind of system we are going for. Seeing united play is dreadful. And yeah I consider us a below midtable club. They really broke us, took 10+ years to let us know we are no longer a big club in all forms.   Hard times are still to come ! Support the club !!!
Mark can you be ruthless and block ALL the ETH out opinions? ETH is the ONLY  solution to revive a winning culture at Manchester United period!. Outside of Pep or Klopp there is no other ruthless managers for this job. I only wish he had the power like the aforementioned two most ruthless managers in the EPL.
Liverpool vs Man U is December 17th at Anfield is going to be interesting lol
Ppl forget to mention that de zerbi picked up a good squad with similar style of play from Potter.
if hes sact ill go for paul ince
Imagine spending £400 million and Johnny Evans is still Centre Half.
Talking about sacking the manager is not productive nor progressive. None of the current players are at same level as SAF era players (except for their fat wages).
How many times last season ten hag said they don't follow the principle
It's hilarious how Mark blames the board the players for not playing good football, yet still blames ole and criticises ole, makes up scenarios about ole, but makes excuses for eth for the same  problems and worst style of play
I dont know what more we can do?
SUPPORT ETH
U Want glazzers out, but u keep watching glazzers club
Why continue to replace the manager instead of the players? It's more cost-effective to let go of one manager than several players.
Goldbridge is the TURD ! 😅
What’s Tottenham spent ??
Funny though!
Mark's nose is so far up Ten Hag's arse that he can't smell the bullshit that is coming out of his own mouth.
True facts
Simpletons will blame the manager.  Real ones know it’s the players.
I agree give him another half a billion to spend and bring in another 16 players then get rid of him 😮
BTW look at other clubs, man utd just so unique…
Glazers out
The more you look at it, the more you can see how past managers were right - Van Gaal (Club is commercialised), Jose and even Ole stated some players think there better than they are. It clear to me that as long as certain players stay  we are forever staying in the same cycle.
Gary Neville for coach
Rashford was here before ole and his English journalists bum buddies, martial dalot Mctominay before ole and let’s not forget we need to clear Oles coaching staff
Verane Casimero or Ericsson for captain
I have realize that longtime
My brother in christ the players ETH brought in have also been just as shite
Erik 7 Hag how manu times have you been spanked ! 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Pelistri over Antony all day
Even if sancho apologised and plays, he has hardly set the world alight anyway
Whatever happened to *"fastest to 50 game wins"?😊
Casimero maino and Ericsson in midfield anything else is garbage
Here’s one for you mark, which players do we start with first to get rid of? interesting one coz I’d love to get rid of loads but we know under these lot they can only do a couple at a time
Where were the updates on Casemiro and Varane?
Need better movement off the ball and play through the middle not just on the break it’s like they’re not sure where to move off the ball
The Glazers are going nowhere, if ten hag stays you are going to fall lower and lower down the table - Ten Hag in! 😊
Players just ain’t good enough, and just about all of the ones he signed, I don’t rate him as a manager in the premier league, the club has not improved playing style since he’s been at the club, sack him now
Ten Hag has given himself too much power by getting the club to sack Ralf
This is nothing more than the clubs PR outlet on YouTube, youe spout what the club tells you to and tour sheep all believe it.
The managers signings have been poor
My club Spurs asked big ange if he wanted David raya in the summer , ange wanted to speak to raya first before  giving the okay to make the signing , after speaking to Raya ange said he felt that it was more about him getting out of Brentford than it was him actually really wanting to join spurs so he didn’t green light the transfer and we signed big vicario instead , the manager HAS to have an Input on transfers but should also have a DOF and scouting network around him where everybody’s opinion is listened to and valued
God i hope United keep losing this is so funny!
Goldbridge is an expert in taking a bath with a turd
We have 4 backups starting in the back line, a new young striker that came in with no time to gel with his attacking partners....The midfield struggles with injuries also... IMO the team is solid, IF IT WAS HEALTHY. ETH cannot be held accountable for the insane amount of injuries we have.... or the way United get held hostage in the transfer market... WE NEED TO STAY UNITED, find those players that complain about ETH being to tough and get rid of them.
Spot on mark about these petulant players. Our players dont even believe in each other the way other top 6 teams do.  Some fans are so stupid is crazy.
Agreed Mark..
time to unfollow ,the blind support for ten hag even when all know he is the worst manager take the team ever !
Only Manchester United supporters believe that by rubbing a bald manager’s head like he’s a genie in the lamp can you get the best out of the team. How did Newcastle get so good….NEW MANAGER. How did Tottenham get so good….NEW MANAGER. Some managers aren’t cut out for the Prem and this pr!ck isn’t
The people forget how was the beggining of Arteta at Arsenal and look and them now, ill keep giving time to Erik
Its the players not performing really... and some questionable lineups. Jadon.S is ya best player and he isn't even playing.... yikes Bruno cares but isn't good enough to be captain
Players OUT -  We need to change approach, if we cant sell a player terminate their contracts.
If they are going to play like this they do not deserve to wear a Man United shirt, so they should not. Send then out in an alternative kit until we see an improvement in attitude. The reduction in kit sales would hit the Glazers in the pocket.
Changes have to be made like Arteta did wonderful players not expensive and they are excellent. Getting rid of ETH will never solve Manchester United problem
Mark, spot on. Get those jokers out . Been too long looking their shitty names on MU jersey. Absolute disgrace esp Mcguire crap.
Power to the players, a manager forced with a pool of unwanted players after more than a year, that’s great management!
8:14 World Class 👏🏿😂
Best player yesterday was AWB
Put a real football structure in with a real Director of Football. Then the DoF makes the decision about ETH. Until we do that, sacking ETH will solve nothing.
i can't believe Mark the one who i trust in united fans become like Ole fans but with TH !! so sad
I wish I could go to Old Trafford and sing "Ten Hag In! GLAZZERS OUT". We need to sing this in every single game!
Spent  400m+ to struggle against Sheffield United enough said 😂
Sell trsford
Pep literally said we won’t compete until we have a structure
You can get rid of all of the deadwood, but things will not change. The manager has not got a clue what to do. He has 8 of his own players and they all look lost too.
Why are you in a brothel Mark
But ETH's pricey signings are not turning up
'Trying to make it more diverse?' No, some of us aren't self-hating woke prats. It sounds like YOU are the one who has an issue with the English. By all metrics we are one of the most tolerant nations on earth.
You all should watch Daren Farley's impression of Harry Mcguire post Nescastle match 😂
Wasn't ETH appointed with a remit to clear out the dead wood/dead bodies and make wider sweeping reforms to ultimately make things better. I think he needs to stay. Turd and bath water a good analogy.
The issue is that the players that Ten Hag has brought in are doing worse. I don’t agree with sacking him now but let’s agree he is under pressure due to his own decisions, team selection and tactics.
Don’t think I’ve heard the word turd so much in so little time 😂
The club must support the manager. Get rid of the non-performing players and help the manager to build a new team'
LOL mark so many fans have said this and you disagreed. I know two months ago I was on here saying blow it up! We need all new players. When I was saying that everyone was like oh no we’re good our players are good.
The results say it...this is a death spiral and ETH will be in the coffin...😮
Thank you for being so on point about “The Players”. Thank you 🙏🏾 Mark. Finally, someone making sense. Martial- waste, McGuire, why is Evans there? Rashford was lucky last season and I dare him to re-produce that type of form  at any point in the remainder of his career. United is now training session for Newcastle 😂😂  Mark you spit 🔥 right here, facts!!!!!
I've been saying it's the players for years and years and backed most managers.
Man United are not exactly triggers broom
Even good players who come in get Glazerised, before long they are rotten like the club. No manager is going to be successful with the current owners. ETH got rid of the one player too good to rot, Ronaldo
Bring in Graham potter or merge with Man City
IS THIS THE SAME ANTI FOREIGN MEDIA  THAT CREAM THEMSELVES OVER PEP AND KLOPP 🤔 AND ALL THE FOREIGN PLAYERS WHO ARE PLAYING WELL 🤔
Why does Ratcliffe want to walk in to all this mess?
Manchester United at the moment is a circus for managers, a charity club for average players, a graveyard to brilliant players, and a haven to owners. The whole club is toxic: there needs to be a complete make-over. They need to be resurrected from the dead like teams the likes of Newcastle and Arsenal, etc....
A turd in the bath tub?...thts brilliant mate
Toxic positive marky 😂😂 standards are on the floor
Do you think utd will be in a relegation battle this season mark???
I've been saying this for ages these players are bunch of clowns and believing their own hype in which the reality most of them can never make it to any top team in Europe  Imagine players complaining about managers methods in training
All well and good saying get rid of these players… but it’s not possible with these players having so much power! Proved over the summer
ETH got rid of or at least didn't support Ralf Rangnick who had the potential of being a very good Sporting Director for Man Utd. Therefore no proper recruitment, a bad group of players, no young players on the horizon etc.
It’s sad but everyone needs to face up to it the players don’t want to play for Ten hag and his tactics are very poor it’s like the players are told to waste time and not try win games 🤦🏽‍♂️
Who is going to buy your players? No club would touch them not good enough,iam afraid you are stuck with them..
Usually I have different opinions with you Mark, But this time we are on the same page
he said turd! love the analogy.  we need a strong defense to give the team confidence to go forward.  these defensive injuries are killing us.  not that we'd be winning the league with this squad but we'd be far better than we are.
Please remove the toxic players.Start using the youngsters.I can bet Pep will offload them if he manage Good analogy Mark
ETH let Lingard go and then a year later bought a Lingard clone in Mount! Mount plays exactly the same, he runs around a lot and tries hopeful shots from outside the area. He will be the reason ETH gets the sack unless he has the gonads to realise he made a mistake and dump him. I think he will last until the FA cup ties come around, get dumped out of that early and he is toast.
What player that arrived this summer has added to the team
Thank you Mark, please continue doing this, its pain in the ass seeing the pathetic fans not supporting the manager
Keep the players who fight for the badge, like Hojlund, bruno, Antony, Amrabat, Martinez
I am so sick to death of our fanbase misrepresenting our spending with ETH as manager.  All I keep hearing is "ETH has spent £400M", and it's complete rubbish.  Do you really think ETH is involved in the negotiations over the price or salary of a player? ETH hasn't spent a penny. ETH has identified players he wants, and people like Arnold and Murtaugh have gotten fleeced on the fee and salary for said players.  If you're at work and need a tool that should cost £100, and the purchasing person goes and pays £200 for it, then are you really going to accept people around you claiming that you spent £200 on something, and you should be able to use it as if it's a £200 value tool. Of course you're not, cos you didn't spend it, and you don't have £200-worth of kit to work with.
If Sancho outlasts Ten Hag I'm quitting
I feel sorry for Ten Hag; even if Guardiola were to coach United, he might not succeed. Instead of the Glazers and the board getting dismissed and leaving the club, they seem determined to stay and potentially harm the club's progress.
The same players that let him  down last season  you mean the ones that got to two finals and finished top 4  Or is it the new players?
Cop out  Easy excuse let’s blame the fringe players! Who have hardly played this season!  We have no identity no playing style  Reluctantly The manger has to go!
What style of play😂😂😂😂😂 the losing style???
5 out of ten Hag. Man U managers job is apoisoned chalice. MU is a toxic work environmentt. Board level management, and entitled supercritical fans alike.
Love your analogy...gave me a good laugh but it is actually a very accurate analogy.
Is mark going woke or something?    Leave out the Petty political bullshit.
All this talk of “ sack ten hag” with all the crap going on in the club who says he even wants to stay!
Like it or not, Mark is 💯 on this. These players have failed under multiple managers and styles of play. GET RID OF THE TURD(s)!
That background 😅
The problem is the owners don't care about United or the history so why would the players? Starts at the top.
based on marks arguments united should have kept ole, or even moyes, ten has has been terrible with transfers, wasted hundreds of millions on trash like antony, the only wan united get back on top is with good recruitment
TEN HAG IN!!!!!
BS! Ten Hag has brought in enough of his own players to be playing better this.
Problem is nobody wants any player from the club. We are paying the best bloody wages for rubbish players. So HOW?
Do you remember pogba story
The players are the once who gotta go first of all..
Martial is a good player in fact a great player who hasn’t reached his potential because the players around him imo if martial would play with a fluid possession attacking team with the right players he would be a top world class player
Absolute blabbering. You’re just a hard headed and stubborn as the exact same Sancho you’re hitting out on. How ironic
I keep on looking at alternative choices and I think the only one is Zidane
I’m backing ETH. It’s the players who don’t wanna play for the badge that need changing. It’s no longer the manager’s problem.
Mark, you forgot about removing Anthony. And given some of ten Hag's appalling transfer follies can we really trust him to buy anyone else?
Game almost unrecognisable from the  football I was brought up on. VAR, screaming for fouls, man-buns and virtue signaling millionaires whining about something or other. If I was a youngster today, I would play rugby instead.
The players them no good
For me, Ten Hag must defeat player power at this club. He needs time to chip away at the rot. The player power will always be here until a manager can overcome it
Me say the same things too get the players out of the club
Get rid of about 12 of them in the January window.
The turd in the bath analogy is comedy gold-bridge
Excellent bath and turd analogy.
Nothing will change until we get rid of the players, staff, and owners so imo it doesn't matter which manager we have because those players will always fail us. The Glazers didn't even speak about Sir Bobby's passing which shows how little they care about the history and future of the club.
The only way the “get rid” can happen, is if we get a new owner who puts football first before commercialization. The owners need to accept the losses on players and allow ETH to truly reset the squad
Drop the dead wood players.  Promote youth players. Youth players will give their heart and soul for the club.
just think of the players and managers goldbridge wanted,  his opinions couldn't be any worse🤣🤣
The club is cursed
Utd have got 6-7 Aubameyang's and have done for years, look what's happened at Arsenal since Arteta got rid of the turds, Utd need to get rid of the mercenaries.
Man u spending 400m is nowhere near the same as city spending 400m we spent 100m on Antony 60m on martinez 60 on casemiro 50 on onana 270m on 4 players City get good players when young and develop them dias doku ederson walker gundo even haaland 60m he's now 160 we get 60m casemiro he's less now
its not abt saying i back the manager, whats ur plan backing the manager. am listening.
Ole would have been here long term if the players would have played for him
Mark its only laughable now tbh. You can't defend ETH on every silly decision he made, which are a lot now. He isnt up to the job. Even if I agree the players are the main problem in this team, he thinks he is a messiah with his stubborn 'tactics' . He just is a trash coach. We have to accept it.
This club is broken from top to bottom , a change of manager will do nothing ,even the fans aren’t UNITED, this club is doomed and I hate saying it !
Disgusting if they sack Ten Hag, But can see it happening, Player power rules
The Club creates these monsters, then wonder why the situation keeps getting toxic.
😮😮
Carling cup is not important . EPL is more important.ETH should concentarte on epl MU still can catch up 4th place.
So players that have let ten hag down so we sell almost every player
Dalot should be played as a winger going forward. He is the most atrocious defender I’ve seen in my life.
Totally agree. Need to give Erik another season  If third season is bad then he’s gotta go
Enough of you defending ten hag just get to varane and casimero ffs.
ETH looked like a ghost last night. After the goals, he just sat on the bench speechless. No one said anything. I am not sure it will be the right decision but I think he knows the game is nearly up.
If you can’t see anything wrong with Ten Hag then you are just choosing to be delusional. Ten Hag is clueless.
Hi Mark they complain about training under ole now ten hagg it's player power
This man is a total fool with his point
Are we being delusional here? If the players are the problem so why does Ten Hag have to keep on playing the same players?   Rashford clearly doesn’t want to play but he keeps playing him. Whose fault is that?
Commenting this for the 100th time! Spot on mark, the players don't care they forget what just happened soon as they get into their cars. Half of the team have quaility but zero mentality or balls
Send roy kean into the dressing room.
FFS don't you get it he can't manage these players,so he isn't doing his job,if Sancho wasn't working hard enough, so he's put him out to rot,he must have been bad, because the team he's playing aren't working hard either,
Maybe we need player out protests
Your growing on me mark. Talking FACTS for once 💪
24:03 he needs twelve players? He's signed sixteen currently 💀
I understand that ETH wasnt backed, In that they wouldn’t clear out what he wanted out, however, his own signings are failing as well. The players he wanted, he can’t get playin. That is a massive issue for me, Mount has been shocking, and that’s only worse Becuase most fanatsy didn’t want/believe In Mount. That was all ETH, as well as Anthony. He wanted Rashford to stay and now can’t get a tune out of him. We can’t get a sniff against Newcastle’s 4th and 5th choice CB with back up FB and GK.
Should name and shame more nobheads like known matterface etc
Could it be, 4 injuries on the back line?
Please sell these players  We don't need them
Mark please get a Manager whos called "Richard" and call him Richard the Turd
The manager seems clueless, the players are gutless and our football is hopeless. Copenhagen will play us off the park next week and dump us out of Europe. All last seasons progress undone
Don’t think for one second that these players don’t know their inflated wages aren’t being equaled anywhere.
8:07 I'm absolutely crying, that might be the best analogy I've ever heard 😂
If Mourinho was backed, this club wouldn't be where there are right now.
Haha! Spent between 400 and 500 million... THatS noT eVEn HalF a BiLlIoN
Thing is Eric ten hag is just adding to the turd ...ie Anthony,  mount, onana
Am TEN HAG IN AND THOSE PLAYERS ARE THE PROBLEM,BUT GETTING THE PLAYERS OUT ARE TO HARD GET RID OF THEM.
Southgate ...incoming next summer
Rashford 250 league games 77 goals
i guess instead of sacking eth they should sack murtough and arnold for not doing well what they are supposed to do i.e. buying good players with the vision of the manager in mind. FYI manager asked for kim, pavard we got johnny evans back. Stop blaming your manager as he has a cup to show and by the way what murtough and arnold have achieved?🤔
Players to keep:  Casemiro  Martinez Luke Shaw  Rasmus Højlund Garnacho Eriksen  Bruno Onana  Varane
Until we cut our losses, we have to get rid of lots of these players spot on mark.
Either Ten hag is extremely bad at telling fans about injuries or hes just abysmally bad at making the right Substitutions... Most of the times he puts subs on it makes absolutely no sense... I also cant believe he havnt tried starting with Martial and Hojlund at the same time, I actually believe it could work well, but he keeps playing useless Antony who cant hit the ball properly. Everytime he shoots or try to pass  in the box, it ends up where there is no one...
ETH is not good enough face facts. We have no style of play, no game plan. I would not give him another penny
I honestly wonder how many of the community would accept relegation, if it guaranteed new ownership, and the exit of the bluffers??? May be not long from finding out ......
Everyone keep saying these same players did the same thing under Jose and Ole. The question is how many of these players played for Jose and Ole? Eth bought Antony, Mount, Casemiro, Onana, Martinez, Malacia, eriksen, Hojlund, Amrabat on loan, Reguilon.he brought Garnacho and Hannibal to the 1st team So stop spreading misinformation
Players get all the credit when it goes right and the manager gets all the blame when it goes wrong. Certain players need sacking once and for all.
I thought he had got rid of the trouble makers!
If Southgate came in as united manager I would stop watching football full stop!
I would love to know what Alex Fergusons thoughts are. Not that we will ever find out!
Completely agree the players are the problem first and the then higher up the club is broken. The fans need to support Ten Hag he needs time to build his own team.
I would like to see what colour mark turns if they fire EtH and hire Southgate. :)
80 +million for a fidget spinner😂😂
You said everything right Mark, but you lost me when you defend Bruno. Overrated and a big reason why we are terrible.
Maybe the team is the problem,  but it doesn't mean that zero hag is not the problem at all... I have enough from this useless manager,  he is useless,  the worst manager by far...don't search for excuses for zero hag...he has to leave first!!
Club isn’t going to get fixed anytime soon. All of the points mark has outlined are completely being dismissed by so many of the fans in the fanbase. Comment section is infected by these morons.
Over the Ronaldo's crisis I hear over and over that " Nobody is above the manager ". And Teng was put that high over every player. This is what it brought to the club.
no mark u got it dead wrong on ten haag… time to change.. buying mount and no cb costing us this season. good job on sancho
Mark why are u blaming your bench players.  Put the blame on the 8 players ten hag bought
Mark you have to understand you can’t get rid of the players because  NOBODY WANTS THESE PLAYERS😂  I remember you guys were pressing for Martial to join Juventus and we said HELL NO.
In French we say " le ver est dans le fruit ".
Goldbridge you’re giving too much excess
What about his players he has
Ive been saying Rashford isnt good enough for 5 years, and i warned about him receiving a bumper contract and that Utd would be committing football suicide.
Nobody wants the players you mentioned but yet the manager kept playing them.
Get the old hag OUUUUUUUUT !!! Bring Sean Dyche in he’ll have these players play the only thing they can do ; Kick & Rush !!!!!
Can we not start putting in youngsters?? Id rather lose with kids that want to try and represent the badge, and put the loafers onto the reserves?
Unfortunately not just the legacy players, look at EtH signings as well.
mark, I agree they get paid to do it and they are not preforming their fullest and if we get a new manager no one will come and we cant afford for anyone to come some people haven't watched man u thinking they can just come and say sack the manager because we aren't winning its the players no one wants to support this club when its a constant cycle the players aren't playing their best I think the players would be good enough but they aren't playing their best they dont have an attitude to playing for this club i wonder if its something happening in the dressing room ?
Get rid of the fucking players aren't good enough
We need Southgate
Mark Goldbridge why you keep saying Martial is not good enough??? And Rashford is good enough??GET Ride of     Rashford first.
Thing is ETH didn't get his first choice players if he did our team would look much different.
The only winners at the Club will be the shameless, sabotaging players Vs ETH.
We can’t lose another manager otherwise this spiral downwards will continue. The players STILL here will not have any trust in another manager n with each other
EtH made a mistake recommending Ragnick off the club Rashford  is having personal issues with him breaking up with his girlfriend
they lost because of Pogba ask Neville
ETH OUT NOW! Spurs managed to find a new manager & look at them now. It's not down to the fanbase to find a solution. This card wasn't played with previous managers,  so why does ETH get a free pass?
Accept the club for what they currently are, mid table team scrapping for results. You can't win everything all the time, no matter who you are.
8:25 🤣
People keep saying “these are his players” Last night Onana, Casemiro, Antony Mount, were the only players that were his.  Reguillon was a panic last minute loan, doesn’t count. Casemiro almost doesn’t count because he isn’t the profile he wanted but we panicked after losing to Brentford 4-0. Amrabat is a loan.  The players out there failing are the same ones that have been there for years
No manager in the world will get this group of players playing good football for any significant period of time. Sick of the cycle, if only the club went through with the open heart surgery that it needed. Instead this team continues to circle the toilet drain.
Once you get the sporting director in and the CEO and start removing the toxic players, then start getting players who wants to play for the club, as you said
Ask Rat n Glazers
Every team we play plays better more structured football. Clear out deadwood whatever the cost. Feel sorry for ten hag
Marital doesn’t play what u talking about
Kicking people doesn't mean u care
I remember what Ben Foster said on one of the podcasts about Bonuses on players wages. This is one of the worst things Man U have done.
The managers are getting the best out of these players. their best is far from good enough. i've said this for years
Utd couldn’t score in that brothel mark is in.
@Ajax Ten Hag had Overmars as sporting director. Oversmars relieved Ten Hag from all sort of distractions and did all the tranfers and got the type off players Ten Hag wanted. But not @United.
Phil Jones finally leaving last season after almost a decade of nothing explains how this club is bring ran
I think you are spot on Mark
Rashford has more apps than many 30yrs old. I think he shouldve bloomed by now and its not happening. Time to go
Apparently Paul Scholes said he would have liked to have taken over after Ole, didn't Paul get the sack from Salford
Mayby the players wont Play for the Glazers.
Honestly I don’t think the players are downing tools  Which makes this worse
As a Liverpool supporter, I'd say get Macguire and Rushford and maybe Martial out of your dressing room and united can start healing as a team.. players like that are the common denominator for this repeated cycle of failure. Having said that, I can't wait for December and watch Liverpool play you lot while you're in this form 😂
Here’s a thought. Chelsea sold almost a whole team. Players not playing or caring. So we sold them. New players and yes we ain’t there yet but we are slowly improving. We are the first premier league side to sell nearly the whole team. Try it. Suffer. Then be great again.
You constantly go after the British players.
Ten Hag’s players aren’t up to much…
bring in a manager who can bring the best out of these players? U know what these players are best at? Defensive counter attack!!! U want Man Utd to play in this style??? They are a bunch of unteachable...
Klopp got the bag eggs out straight away in his first year or two, he wouldn’t allow dissent to affect the team from individuals
De zerbi with a better structure has a low winning percentage than ETH. He'll fail if he comes, guranteed.
Mount, Antony, Onana, Malacia. All players Ten Hag demanded and they wouldn't even play for Brighton.
Ryan Gravenberch 💯
Times running out for ETH. It may not be the best idea, but I dont think Radcliffe is going to tolerate any more bad performances, regardless of the players. I dont think he rates ETH and probably wants a manager that he believes in.
Results of poor professionalism, poor cohesion due to injuries and lack of effort and poor direction. That being said, Erik can turn it around, at least I hope so because some of those players can be difficult to motivate
The problem Mark is that just "playing for the shirt" without an adequate tactical system to back it up won't change the result against a team like Newcastle. Effort counts but if you think just "giving it everything" is sufficient in professional football, you're totally delusional.
JUST FUCKING GET RELEGATED  ALL PLAYERS WILL BE OUT
Why do so many players fail at Man Utd?   Van de Beek, Jadon Sancho, Antony dos Santos,  Mason Mount ...
How do we get rid of these players Mr gold bridge since you got all the answer , the club put them on ridiculous contracts.  It’s alway easier to get rid of one man , than 30 . .
Im at the point now where im not bothered about results, the thing that gets me the most is that the 75% of the team have no desire to fight for the badge, i could deal with losses if the team actually worked hard
We're in a toxic relationship.
Not Even Pep Could Get the Best Out Of This Squad 🤡
Sorry eight of the players are eight that the manager wanted the spine of the team is his!
TBH I had more expectation for Ten Hag than Ole when he came in because Ten Hag had a superior CV than Ole. I had beliefs judging his records with Ajax but Ole was better. Ole, Mckenna and Carrick were building a team that was somehow united than Ten Hag's team. Fans pressurized Ole's Sacking too much to the point where the board had enough and decided to give them their wish.   Ten Hag came with his arrogance and Stubbornness, Commenting nonsenses on players in the media, it seems that something is wrong with his personality. for me Ten Hag is a deserving sackable manager than all those previous managers except Moyes.   And Ten Hag doesn't have his own "Ajax" style of playing as many analysts suggests. The Ajax style was there before Ten Hag and almost every previous Ajax managers before him have utilized that style, their style is their identity as a football Club.
ETH INNNNNN CONTRACT RENEWAL IMMEDIATELY  ALL HAIL ETH
You could bring in any top manager, results won't change, these players are not good enough.
It's time to go!
Leave martial alone
Mark has truly arrived on the 'negation' phase. I remember when he was on that during Ole’s time, eventually he did end up screaming get out and it’ll be no different now
Yes Mark! One of your best yet!
Xabi Alonso
Everything Ronaldo said about the club is right
I don't think ten harg is the man but like mark say who is your better off going though hell with him like arsenal did an hope an pray the glazzers sale the club
How did the turd get into the bath
Look at West Ham two Ajax players Kudus and Alvarez both performing well under Moyes.  Yet we chose Mount and Amrabat ?
Get ridd these crap players seen enough them ten hag not going no where
Times are tough with Mark doing the show at the local brothel!
Rashford should be the first to sack before any player
LETS SURVIVE RELEGATION FIRST ALL PLAYERS OUT NOW
A wise man once said: “ its not cosmetic, its open-heart surgery”  tenHagIN !! GlazersOut !! Players Out !!
I blame ETH for playing martial instead of HOLJUND along side garnacho! Benching AWB to play Dalot! Regardless players should should show the zeal to win but no!
The only time we came close to implement a new way of football was with LVG....and that season he got rid of 15/16 players ? then no one has been able to get them play any type of football...counter attack, possession, transition... they just want to do what they want ! New managers come in and has to adapt to players there and their strenght but they have no strenght especially when their head is down !
You speak especially in the case of Ten Hag continually wrong that doesn´t help MU as a club  and we only see declination.
Your only telling half the story what about the players ten haag has brought in he’s spent like 400m there’s no quality at man United from players that have outstayed there welcome and new players not good enough
Nothing will change, no matter who you  appoint as a manager, until such time the parasitical infection called the Glazers are removed !
We are lucky that the newly promoted teams are so weak.
Crap players on massive contracts - so they won't leave.  If they won't leave - the results will continue.  Awful recruitment and terrible club management
The biggiest turd still there. THE GLAZERS.
The important question is how far do we have to fall before a sacking takes place. It's actually at the stage where the current set up is actively destroying the season. I mean we have to do Something. Can't just keep tolerating heavy losses indefinitely.
The players are not good enough simple as that
Great Mark! Love your work and speak the truth, all that matters!
Again Rashford failed to be professional, Bruno is finished as well, Amrabat should seat on bench while Hannibal and kobbie handle the midfield. Bruno should be sold along side martial and rashford because rashford isn’t trying to improve himself at all
We have had 6 manager's since fergie left clearly its not the manager!! Like mark said there are players still at the club that was there under all them mangers thats the problem.  A new manager will have the same problem's.
Big ange can do it with the Players that Conte think is sh1t..you just need to find your version of ange..🤣🤣
We could replace eth with scobbie doo at least he’ll bark out the orders yanks out
I said it before and i will continue sayin it,, until we get rid of the board n players,, it will be the same thing,, these playerd n the board is gettin rid of managers while they still here,, any other manager come in,, it will be the same thing
I see bookmakers this morning have put the prices for next United permanent manager.
Some players need to go, true, but replacing an entire squad is impossible so whoever coaches United will HAVE to try and improve this squad. There's no other way...
Martial has to be up there with the worst of the Utd. players, the guy barely runs.
you cant blame racism. Antony and Bruno are petulant children and that has nothing to do with anything other than their own piss poor mentalities. You keep saying it's the players fault, but when people point out the player's faults there's always an excuse. It needs to stop.
Rashford came on for half an hour and showed nothing.
Does Mark fancy the Dutch Solskjaer he's obsessed with him.
You just need to watch a presser with that weird little bald man with no people skills , no art of persuasion and  apperantly even less football knowledge.  Clearly a monkey could have done well with that Ajax team.  Here's a tip.  Stop hiring managers and players on the back of one campaign.  Failure to motivate IS A MANAGER failure.
He bought Mason Mount Mark. Surely enough said.
Agree with you Mark, well said.
BRING IN DIVISION ONE PLAYERS ALL IN  SACK ALL CURRENT PLAYERS NOW
Mark = illogical
I vote Golbridge as assistant manager🎉
The thing is about Sancho is he could make the right wing his own at the min instead he’d prefer to act like a child
I'd like to see a formation change, just something different to show we are trying things.
That turd analogy almost killed me Mark 😂😅 Great post as per 😎👍⚽️👌🤜🍸
Why is he suddenly blaming the player when the coach is ten haag ?
ETH paid how much for Mason Mount? What for??
We can’t sack another manager
Very true spot on Mark.
RELEASE ALL PLAYERS NOW
GET RID OF ONANA MOUNT ANTHONY IMMEDIATELY
In ETH we trust!
Do you not realise how management works mark? I am not sure you do. When you are a manager you have a vision and a plan of what type of team you want, how you want to perform and the goals you want to reach. Now lets talk about ETH..... he HAS BOUGHT AND SPENT 400 MILLION POUND ON HIS TEAM AND ON HIS VISION AND IT HAS FAILED!!!!!! Therefore he has failed. If the players are the problem - ETH has brought most of them in?
WE WILL GET EVEN LOWER
Need to get rid of the players
It should be ETH  first job to get rid of HM yet  he gave him armband. So did AM.He praise him. It is ETH choice to buy Varane,  Cas that already lost appatite. So stop blaming club and Players. Ask ETH first. All NU Players almost unknown and look mediocre before Howe came.
PLAYERS ALL OUT N9W
SACK THE PLAYERS NOW
I’d rather lose every single player than TenHaag   I loath every single player and hate the fact after all these year there still playing for this club   Disgusting
He needs support ? What are we supporting exactly ?
I misread the title as suspended instead of supported
I don't think who ever take over won't be able to get anything out of these players. Mark look at City they blend together. these players number one are not good enough and the players he's bought are not good enough. To much player power. Glazer's out.
Mark you're a donkey mate.
Lol mark talking about dirt dirt dirt yet ITS ETH who decide to play those dirt week in and week out
Im agree with you. Martial, Macto, Lindeloft, Dalot, even R4 and Bruno should go
Reality is it does not matter who coaches these players is, they will never be good enough to win the trophies this club deserves
Utd pay crazy wages and getting rid of players is difficult. The players will not get those wages elsewhere.
Honestly until some toxic player leaves united we’ll keep struggling
I'm done with these plastic fans going on the manager, they forgot we are still owned by glazers, do you trust glazers to bring competent manager
We have changed so many managers. Has it helped ??? We can’t keep doing the same thing and expect different results. We need to crush player power … especially when the players are rubbish.
If Chelsea fires Pochettino then I’m sure United with fire Ten Hag and hire him.
Sack Ten Hag. Hire Carrick as intermediate manager,
TEN HAG IN!
Which player that's playing for the club now has been here over 5years? Ten haag came in and embraced those players even though he saw they were crap the prior season.  He refused even to meet with Ragnick. His arrogance has gotten the better of him.
Cool, lets keep backing Ten Hag and keep getting our ass kicked.  Sounds about right.  I mean he's only had 18 months and 400 million pounds.  Who can work with that?    We're not going to win a cup or be anywhere near top 4 but totally,  ETH is the man and we need to back him. Whats a couple dozen losses here or there?  In Erik we trust...
Just wait til united get smashed by Fulham.
Nope. The moment he came out and admitted that he wasn't trying to instill the style of football that made united fans root for him over Poch, it was game over. HE HAS TO GO.
Search for excuses as much as you want but ten Hag is just a Dutch youth manager. Very good with young players but failed massively when it comes down to proper Premiership football
Keep blinding supporting Glazers Mark . You guys quiet down on the main issue . As mentioned Jimmy and Glazers will bring this club to ground . Good luck
This channel is just a rubbish PR machine for this ridiculously average manager.
Remember when Pogba was the cause of all United's problems?
Not Ten Hag should be sack  get rid of all those lazy players, just getting fat salaries for nothing this suck.
Who's got to go,,they've all been shite including ETH
I want to keep him and I agree with some of what you said, but you keep asking what people would do after, but what would you do to keep him? The players look like they've dropped tools and you can't go all season like this. Like it or not the players are more powerful at every club, his job relies of keeping them onside and if that's gone so is he.
The turd in the bath analogy was class.. 😂😂 Poch maybe available soon. 😮
Cant believe marks first change would be to bring back De Glued even though Onana is one of our best players atm.
Road to championship ❤️
Deluded.
I am baffled that people want to keep a manager that chooses to try to play counter attacking football, when he knows it's not sustainable and that it won't win you anything of importance.  For me, that says everything.
Yes the players are crap. But who signed and plays them every week?
Gary Neville is a prat
Everyone keeps asking "who do you replace him with"..  What about the question: "what happens if the players keep downing tools?" ⁉️
We've got a squad of floaters, doesnt matter how many times u flush, the buggers pop back up. No manager has been able to get a tune out of them long term, yet they remain.
