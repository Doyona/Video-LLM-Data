Apologies to Flakes Power! He is not a German content creator but the largest content creator in Brazil, congrats on the icon skin!

RIP
1:38 dont worry! If youre lucky enough to find it in CH4S2 Meowscles has a little secret house between Frenzy and Salty
0:28 i get this every few games, still blows my mind
I already saw triple lamas
P
6:30 that’s not the only
Rip
RIP Risky Reels. You will be in our hearts.
RIP 5:35
Fortnite should add where you can pick what chapter you want to play in
I got a whiplash by rift portal
I was playing Fortnite with my brother and I saw 4 lama’s
2:53  Whiplash ain’t completely gone there’s a rift that spawns a whiplash
I FOUND ALL 4 LAMMAS IN ONE PLACE BECAUSE IT WAS THE TRIPLE LAMMA THEN A NORMAL ONE IT WAS SO RARE HAHAHHA.
Rip risky reels
rip
I’ve gotten a quadruple llama before … Then, next to it, was a wall with a fricken nome…
Once my friend Thomas found a triple llama and we all freaked out.
you can get a whiplash car in this season but it can only be found in a very rare random spawn, found one on the lake left of brutal bastion, was a whiplash car frozen in mid air going over a ramp with some wooden crates.
Omg I have had the 3 Llama spawn twice
Whopper, Whopper, Whopper, Whopper Junior, Double, Triple Whopper Flame-grilled taste with perfect toppers
the fortnite battle is way better than the wazone battle pass thats just my opinnion
Why the wip wash
Is no one talking about the goo coming out of the mountains next to the place with the shockwave stones?
I have seen 3 lamas on a rock in Fortnite
3 llama I got
rip
Thank God the IO is back they were WAYYY better than the seven. Bring back their tuned sedan
My boy been homeless for months 😭😭😭
The Waffle House Has Found Its New Host
I want old Fort it's back when it was just guns wood
Rip
Your the most clickbait youtuber ever none of this is real
A whiplash can appier through the rifts
Wait, triple llama happened to me
Metallica is already a big colab. Fortnite should be lucky that they even let them use their songs. To all you people who think it helped Metallica it didn't. They were already the biggest metal band in the world with only being outsold by 5 artists in the last 40 years.
midas does look like chamber, will fortnite finally be the one to sue?!
You can find the car in rift thing
Incorrect, whiplashes are still in game
i found a triple lama right under slappy
I got 4 llamas I have no idea how but yeah
people know about snowballs we just cant find ways to use them
rip
Rip
They didn't remove wip lashes
T5G if you go west of frenzy farms you will find a house and inside of that house the Easter egg to stranger things is there, the one from the old map on fortnitmares
So interesting video game
Hello
Wow amazing game
I think that the people who are going to save us from the Ayo open she like the old characters are going to come back from  in a time machine or something
rip
RIP 🙏
Hi
Has Annyone noticed that slappy shores Is just like San Francisco 😄

Cant forget the i.o. sedan 😭
do you smell that i smell cap
Nice
Nice video

Press f to pay respect for movie thing
Rip
YO @top5gaming you arew my favorite fortnite youtube player !
What's OP about the fishing rod perk, is that you respawn with it when your teammates revive you. So even if you're at border limit or, well, IN the tempest, if your have water nearby you're saved !
No way fortnite is gonna add a Subaru Wrx in the game
Is this build mode
Nice video
Excellent game
Rip
Nahhh I got the triple lama
Can some one give me the battle pass
Fortnite in 2050:  we are announcing our new collaboration where we take a picture of you and we put you in the game so everyone will be the guy from fortnite
There’s a secret room in brutal bastion that has a poster and at first glance I was like “Transformers”? Now that you mention it, it’s probably the reality warrior
wonderful game
i hate that they removed the lamborghini, but other that this is a great season!
You forgot a secret, in one of the secret room in the snow biome, there's a pic of Optimus prime and bumblebee
There is a new map finally
I don't know if anyone paid attention to those paintings in those small secret rooms, but each one has almost one secret related to for example midas, brutus, meowscles and other members of the gang
you know that hole where you hind the clocktower you know what can fit in that hole an eye you know what has a eye the monster from chapter 1
well, that car should be called a race car because it has some racing features.
RIP
If im correct that looks like a subaru
Did you know if you get the krew pack skin and talk to the the helsie npc skin saying im worried hes never been out for this long
What about the oh graphics on chests
So thats why my trio found llamas together…
WHO ELSE BEARLY GOT GHE NOTI
That car is not a Sedan. Sedans have  4 doors and that car had 2 so it is probably a coup
both my first and second game in chapter 4 season 1 I saw a set of triple llamas in each
bro it’s bean six seasons without a  original tier 100
RIP risky reels🥺🥺
Rip
R.I.P risky I remember season 4 first added the battle pass was great the only skins I actually liked were carbide and omega
There is a rift in the new rocket league map
i find 3 lama
Music ?
What if the new Reality Warriors Will be linked to the rooms under the bastions like the cat food one could be meowcicles
I have seen the triple lamma
RIP risky
Flakes Power is not German
Rest in piece SLEEPY SOUND.  You were our hometown. We loved you. You can never be replaced.
I swear this channel has come so long over the years, I still remember watching the kids who stole their mums credit card for vbucks vid
R.I.p
The car on the wall looks like A bmw i3
I want top5gaming to get an icon skin and if it came out I would buy it and USE it
This song never get out of my mind It's like stuck in my head forever

R.i.p risky reals.
Is anyone else seeing THE NEW EMOTE AT 7:45
R.I.P
Rip
I noticed something. When doom guy was fist bumping the toy, it was in first person
Rip
Rip
whats interesting is that originally the heralds body wasnt in that tree; for like the first day or two. but it is now.
Bro I was telling my cousin that I saw mrbeast but he didn’t believe me
RIP
I got a quadruple llama spawn it was crazy
F
Rip 😢
6:02 kind of is not because it originated from the zero war comics
Guys won't anyone talk about the fact that omen from valorant is in the trailer
Rio
RIP reels😢😢😢
RIP
I got triple lama but we could only kill 1
in my second game in the season i found the triple lama but i tought it was a glitch XDD!!
Rip
I had a triple Lamma once
Nice game video
Hulk is in fortnite for 1 hour now
One time I got a triple lama spawn
BRO I WAS PLAYING A GAME OF FORTNITE TODAY AND I ALWAYS WEAR BLUE GHOUL TROOPER AND I 2WS LOOKING AT THE MAK TO SEE WHERE I WOULD LAND. was that me??!!@#$
RIP Risky
Bro doesnt the fortnite island look like old asgard somewhat. But the places are different
R.I.P
Flakespower is not German he is Brazilian
I think that marking is actually a UFO
I found 4 llamas in a single game but it wasn't spawned by the rifts
I forgot it was removed
Rip Risky Reels:(
I found a triple lama yesterday
flakes power is a spanish content creator, he ain‘t german
r.i.p. rocky
why do they keep bringing slone back on the island but not midas 😭😭
Few I thought that was real and I am so happy that it’s fake
i hit snow first game in chapter 4
Rip
Wait wait wait that ball that is at the reality thing on snow isnt that the ball from assasin's Creed 3?!?!
season 4 chap 2 not season 6 chap 2 wich was primal
also as mr beat is coming he is known for giving things so maybe in winterfest?
R.I.P I’m the chat…
Where the zero point is it looks a lot like the vault from chapter 1
I found the lamas a few times
i knew all
Rip
Guys the ageless is geno's son who doesn't wanna work for io And the real geno is dead well sorta He's rebuilding himself at reality 106
Rip for ‘Reels
Did the repair torch get vaulted this season?
rip
rest in peace rocky reels
Stuck at the bottom of the map and it couldn't let me go at the top of my brother
You missed one top five gaming forgot that anime character the power and everything it’s not in the game
I actually found triple Llamas in my first game and I could only kill one before two of em rifted😂
did you know that the buried treasure already came out but not in the way you think
I noticed that klombo is not here maybe this chapter or chapter 5
Rip
R.i.p.
Tbh I hate the new hit marker
rip
In the trailer when you see the doom plush emote it is in 1st person.
I found another secret/ hint, I think? When you use the balance board emote, right at the start you can hear a scream that sound like Mario's. Just thought I'd put it out there.
The drone is also like the owl from far cry primal both can mark enemies
rip
Nah slone died why she back😭
I feel like maybe the 7 won't be returning...until we figure out how to reverse chrome and test it on what's left of the Reality Tree, that is. The reason as to WHY i think this is because of the probability that they were absorbed into the Herald, allowing her to gain as much power as she did. But until AMIE inevitably figures out a way to reverse chromeinization with something like a counter chrome or finding a weakness in the form of water, I doubt that the 7 will be returning any time soon. This only leaves one question...Where did the Paragime go? Simple, remember back in chapter 2, season 5 when the Foundation encased himself into the Zero Point to keep it stable? Well it turns out that with enough research, all of the 7 have the ability to encase their beings in a random material! I'm guessing the way it works is based on how stable the reality is, the material they stand on during said encasement process, or their strength within the 7's group. But this leads into other questions like "Will the Paragime ever be released if the Zero Point is exposed?", "How will AMIE be persuaded to think about bringing back the Scientist?", "Will Geno have a part to play in finding the Heralds remains and freeing the rest of the 7?", "Will the weird ore that powers the Oathbound's weapons ever be used for something like a vehicle or the new shield?" and "Will Agent Jonesy ever be able to finally get a break from dealing with constant wars and supernatural stuff that he wasn't exactly trained to deal with on his own?". These are questions that I have laid out for you to answer yourself and everyone will think differently about the solution to these answers. Work together to figure these out, for a unified answer shall provide the key to knowledge and understanding the next step in the plan. And remember...No matter what happens, Don't give up.
Finally, we can get undercooked food digitally now..
You forgot a secret, I was just minding my business when all of a sudden I saw an NPC do a ritual. He put his arms up in the air and then there was a purple light and a bunch of chickens appeared! 😂
For some reason i can't notice the graphics change. Perhaps i am not a high enough quality human to process the new graphics xD
I like it how you forgot old geno
😭😭😭😭 Old chapter 1 look 🥲
Gianis for NBA is going to be in Fortnite
I wish they added the classic Doom slayer skin
RIP
There's a dinosaur on the side of the world

Hey tg5love youre vids but i saw a secret of reaveling a minecraft collab beacause. i saw a minecraft picture in where the place you can find polar peely plus i think he likes summer very much
Rip
I don’t play fortnite but this was interesting to watch
That’s funny.
This is one of the first seasons I’ve seen in a long time where almost nobody has any major complaints. Let’s just hope they can keep this up later into the chapter :)
I feel like this new chapter has been a major refresher in Fortnite, and definitely adds some gameplay aspects that make it so much more interesting.
Rip i forgot th3 name😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tier 100
The new map is good because it reminds me how much I liked the old map.
i found that same triple lama spawn too
Maybe it will be called tilted tunnels
RIP
the damage number cumulative are worst lots of game give you the option and almost no one use that one
Bro the zero point can just be controlled by geno since the paradigm and the seven is gone I wonder if she build a suit for Jonesey she did have a lot of time do do something like that once fracture happened
rip
I hate how in chapter 3 the Devourer skull could’ve been removed and nothing would change.
Rip 6:13
As a Polyergus, I found this video to be very informing and I thank you for giving me this knowledge to be able to enslave more colonies. I shall tell my queen about this. She'll be thrilled
*I hate how in chapter 3 the Devourer skull could’ve been removed and nothing would change.*
6:00 I WAS TELLING PEOPLE ABOUT THIS
I have a pleasant experience watching your videos 💛💛💛
Do you know what be funny the way to get the Mr. Beast skin you have to buy at MrBeast Burger
Battle lab is in Fortnite under new practice
The back of the herald tree is broken, which means she could have broken out!
Here is a live event idea slurp juice takes half of the map and slap juice takes the other half then they build giant slurp monsters to fight and while they are fighting the somehow expose just a little bit of the zero point to where over time its a problem or the give the coordinates to bad people like the last reality. P.S EPIC LET SLURP WIN!!!!!
rip
pls can u give me v buck
the ghost and shadow henchmen rifted to me
Fortnite is so at it's prime rn
sad we didn't get chrome Midas or miles morales in the battle pass can you do some digging and find out if were still getting chrome midas
Rip
rip risy rales
rip risky
i love your videos can you gift me the battlepass my user is picklepop882
Oh yeah a rift popped right in  front of me
One thing you missed, if you look at the part with the recon drone. You could barely see a figure who looks like Omen from Valorant.
Maybe that picture with the car might be teasing that we might be able to customize cars even more like changing body kits adding spoilers
At 6:30 the spot remains me of splatoon 3
sheld is probably a overwatch collab
The most American house   6:27
RIP 🪦 Rocky Reals
Btw here is a tilted clock tower in the ice cave  you won’t miss  love ur vids
rip
I got the 3 llamas on the first day :) (EDIT) I thought it was a glitch.
The herald is already dead? She was probably the most underwhelming enemy ever
3:38  When I saw the trailer that shield looked pretty familiar and it kinda looks like Rheinharts (I hope I spelt that right) shields from overwatch that could tease an upcoming collab? Could any over watch pros confirm this?
bro reinhardt is coming to fortnite we have the hammer and now a riot shield
By the way t5g theres a setting for cumulative damage vs the regular listing if you dont know already
🪦 rip
Giannis is also joining the icons its revealed on fortnites instagram
i really like the shockwave hammer
Is anybody gonna talk about first person when doom slayer gets showed in the trailer?
Brutal bastion looks EXCACTLY like the roof off the main buolding at synapse station
Yo did you see the hulk cutsence andthen you can see the teebage nutant turtles
girls be like : I dont have any friends😭😭😭  me with no friends : 4:18
Rip risky reels
That supercar painting looks like a Honda Civic but modified
3 lamas is op i have got it🎉🎉😊
Rip
5 out of 30 were secrets.very disappointing
Competitive players don’t even know that Fortnite is upgraded to unreal engine 5😭
I was okaying whit my friend and a crate spawned out of a rift and there we’re wolves in it and there we’re 2 purple ones
love this chapter! just really hate the battle pass but not a big deal :p
Rich people who don’t want them in their own business
I think the ageless is a midas snapshot because he kinda looks like midas (imo)
🪦 rip RR
In your last video, you called the chests "geno chests," but I think it would be better to call them "champion's chests" because they are based from the ageless champion.
One of the secrets I found while playing is that the Combat Shotgun is in the game, and I think you have a 0.01% chance of finding it
Anyone notice that the ageless is not Geno he's Genos snapshot
The new damage display system is trash I can't tell when I'm actually doing damage it'll say 200 or more and somehow they still have shield honestly this whole chapter launch so far sucks
if you use the snowball while a few sec before battle bus launch u invisible until open glider
Slone was in the trailer you can see her in a phone booth
Dude next chapter we should just go back to chapter 1 season 1 and restart but keep our skins
So a random ass german guy gets a skin but not tg or nickeh30
what about the secret room on chapter 3 map fortnite just forgot about it?
I found the triple lamma
Flakes Power is not German, he is brazilian
so, we know that the ageless is a snapshot of Geno then I'm guessing that the Slone skin in the survey is going to be working for the ageless and also that other female skin who has the white and gold color scheme as well.
i got the shadow and ghost henchman rift spawn lol
R.I.P
R.I.P risky reels
When Doom Slayer does his emote in the Chapter 4 trailer we see him go in first person, could this be a hint for first person?
bro said its an german content creator💀💀
i think the stone are a reference to the Dora Milaje from black panther
After this video might start fortnite again
The portable shield and hammer turns you into reignhardt from overwatch
rip
Hey T5G, If you put the oathbound standard emoticon on the boundless cape It does a funny glitch.
Top5 I got 4 lamas in one
They also made the loot colors closer to the og colors, but not completely
W
If you didn't know you could actually revert the damage numbers to what they were in the settings. I found that out on the first day of the season on accident.
What if the 0 point is a massive seed and a group that tree as a trap to catch the Chrome
rip
Rip
Question what happens to the narrator on this channel durning chapters 1 ?
rip
Rip
I found triple lama
So how some dude name flakes power get a skin before typical gamer
I really hope we get a SlapJuice character next season, like Rippley but ofc different a little bit
a lab in in midle of nowhere surrounded by snow guess the think might join the loop just random guess not saying i have proof
Also in brutal bastion there is a hidden room with a pool table
Man Im so exited to see where the storyline takes us!
where is klombo?
Everybody is so happy about the new charter but What about christmas Where is it??
I subscribed and my fortnite user is inot-tbird_army
Me and my friend casual found the triple llama event
Reinhardt main gonna go crazy
Why do you always critisize evry game that copyrighted something from frotnite when it is a rip off of pupg...
rip
Flakes power, a guy I never heard of is getting a skin before typical gamer. That is an outrage
Bruh who else saw mrbeast
RIP
What about Colombo😢
i think they removed the whiplashes becuz of a perk that makes viecles have more hp and infinite fuel
I had the triple LAMMA spawn once and me and my friend were going crazy
btw i knew if u hit the ground u can create a ball of snow and jump in it
Congrats Flakes Power!!! Still waiting for icon skin. For TypicalGamer
DUDE IN CHAPTE 2 SEASON 2 IS THE THING WHEN YOU GO IN THE ROOMS OF THE SKINS THEY ARE SOME THINGS IN THE BACKROUND AND THE TAILOR SHOWED THE LIGHTHOUSE WAS WITH BRUTUS
I loved the part where he talked about MrBeast Burger
Honestly I thought the recon drone was an Assassins Creed type think.
Where is colombo
I realy want lazy lake and tilted come back
Be original no lets take rineharts shield and sovas drone
I think mr beast will be free in the winterfest
Fortnite stole the big Shield thing from Overwatch!
I had a tripple Lama behfore
I found a tripple lamma spawn
I think that like 50% of people here never heard of Flakes power and he gets an icon skin but Nick and TG dont?!
Hi T5G! I’m Fortnite kid
Did you know Coral Buddies are in The artic area On a iceberg behind  a rock
4:33 if u don’t like it you can switch it back to the old sistem
valorant midas: You want to play, Lets play
I think there is a SpongeBob collab coming because of the jellyfish fields
There was a hole in the herald tree. Do you think she escaped?
The next update is next Monday :)
No way was risky added in season 4, though ght it got hit by a meteor then
Three lamas has happened to me and my freind 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😅😂😂😂😂😂
Games got too much stuff man. Wish they left it simple like early ch.1
So basically i saw that picture somewhere else not at frosty something
The painting at the bottom of the lake looks like the zero point with power surrounding it
BTW, there is a place where you immediately die, just near the gas station on the outskirts of the snowy biome
UE5 really changed Fortnite’s graphics
Whiplash was rifted into rocket league!!!
im so unlucky my first game of the new chapter there was a hacker  AND I HIT HIM FOR 200 BUT STILL DID NOT DIE
aya 6:42. U are in the storm run mother f'er run!!!
about the cumulative numbers, u can change it in the settings to list, which is way better for me
man the reason i got good in addition in math is cuz I added the damage i did for my enemy
that time attack gr yaris for no 22 looks so hot
hello
The only person able to get the triple llama would be that one guy who always manages to find a legendary gun before even landing
Owl drone from valorant and reinhardt shield from ow2 💀
It'd be funny if slurp sued slap
also Giannis from the NBA is getting a skin
I didn’t know finding the henchmen was rare I found them while playing with my brother
rip
I seen the Herald before watching this video
I got the three 🦙🦙🦙
I think the shield could even be an overwatch collaboration, and that could be a mythic for Reinhardt because season 2 of overwatch released when chapter 4 began so we there’s a chance.
R.I.P Risky
I love these videos because I can’t play fortnight and this gives me the info of everything going on.
I have to see all of the secrets
I loved rocky reels
Bro why everyone forgot about first person bruh
Think about it? We haven't recieved a new villain/threat yet
Rip slurp 🙏
Found a triple lama on game 1
Who ever reading this God bless you saying to who believe
Rip resky reels 🥲
Typical gamer found triple lama in his video
Who’s ever actully had a triple llama I have
WOMEN RAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
What about the first person perspective in the trailer 🤨
6:19 the more embarrassing thing is that neither rocket league nor rocket league sideswipe are on season 4 They are on season 9 and 6 😂
Anybody else think it's a crime that the alternate Doom Guy styles aren't the classic and 2016 looks?
Found myself with no sprint some games slap juice is the only usable item while running and the barrels are breakable and soaring sprints with slap juice broken found wind tunnles in the snow biom and if have kymera skin can see the new island in his eyes
I just noticed that the like csstle in the middle or  idk IS THE AGENCY BECAUSE LOOK AT THE WATER
please keep me updated my mom grounded me
Give us breaking bad already.
Here is the biggest question  what was in the vault of foundation where are the 7 and what was the nothing
Was it just me or did I see Mr Beast in the chapter 4 season one trailer?
At one of the water falls in the snowy mountains there's a dig up for chests too 😇
We all know what you said
the doom emote (atleast to me) looked like it was in the game
Slap and slurp juice are actually partners, you can see ripely and the owner of the slap juice on the island making a business deal, they can pop out of a rift
I love Tommy very much and am glad he’s been doing the videos! But I’ve been wondering what happened to the other guy. I used to watch all the t5g videos and I kind of miss his voice and the old t5g video music. Just for nostalgia reasons! If anybody could let me know what happened, I’m just curious!
Me and my friend were playing and got lucky and found 3 llamas
For everyone wanting old damage numbers and not cumulative, there are settings for it in game in the hud section
i'm sorry but the reality fortress really look's like the high hrothgar in skyrim
Played chapter 4 yesterday and I was killing non stop the shot gun is so strong with just 3 shots I eliminated people
Awesome video T5G!!! OMG THIS NEW CHAPTER IS AMAZING!!!!!
Lonely labs gave me chills (no pun) because it felt like i was back in season 7
yeah the henchmen are cool but wheres the seven sentry, IO guard and the alien
You should collab with PlayStation grenade
Flakes is German but flakes power is español
That doom guy Is just a thicc master cheif
Rip tilted an rocky thanks chapter 3 it was lots of fun
I hope tilted never comes back   People complain when its gone  But the reality is its been here every season
Deku from my hero academia is also coming to fortnite
Love this chapter
I don’t know how but I found a combat shotgun yesterday and I think they are rare
Slurp juice is gone ☹️
tommy: better grapgi- me and the other switch players: oh no
First game of the chapter me and my friends found triple lamma
F for risky
3:38 That looks like Newcastle's Mobile Shield from Apex Legends
Rip risky )':
Germán? Kkkkk
The new sports car looks like a Honda Civic  👇🏼
go the triple llama in my first game thought it was a glitch
If you read the description of the ageless it says that he's a snapshot
The recon drone is awfully similar to the bird in assassin's creed Odyssey
I wonder if 1rst person is coming
what about the fact that the doom slayer’s emote was in first person in the video?
I have Find them
I love the new chapter! This is the first time I've been really excited to play fortnite in ages
Holly hedge hidden hedge
Bro I found 3 llamas together in my first match then found a 4th one 😳
Riot shield Are we going to get RATS of Chapter 4
There is not a tier 100 the highest tier is 94
I can't believe it.... they made fortnite fun again. and also a Easter egg I found with my friend whilst playing duos is I forgot where but a picture of sleepy sound behind a chimney on the inside of a random house
rip
RIP rocky reels my first place I landed in chapter 2
Did you realise when the Doom Slayer guy was doing his emote in the trailer, did you realise he’s in First Person?!
6:34 looks like that car that was leaked in chapter 2
idk Typical Gamer is not getting an icon skin.Hopefully he will get it soon.
1:51  That’s funny. That was the first place I landed during my first trip on the island.   The circle of trees on the map just drew me there. Almost as if the zero point was calling me.   Either way, I’m happy to know it’s safe and sound. Not under water, in the sky or where others are going to use it. It can finally be left alone
Hu
Whiplashes rifted to the rocket league world in the Octane  trailer
By the way the whiplash has not been removed but only rare
I am like 90% sure that the island at 7:18 was the one Castaway Jonesy was on.because the campfire might be referencing the flare gun’s fire
I miss Risky/Rocky Reels so much
Greetz from NL
Bro I cant wait till 37 days end cuz I can finally play
i found 4 x lamas in one spot
I found a lama on a roof then the triple lama
I've been baited I came here, thinking ill see Mr Beast burger restaurant😭
If you complete all the oathboard you can build amid body in two days
Nooooooooo!!! Risky!!😢
i wanted pleasant park and lazy lake to come back. who else misses those pois
Rip risky reels
Couldn't the reality warriors be meoscles, midas and his team ?
I do t think you realized but in the description of the ageless champion is says ache is a snapshot of geno not really geno
Fortnite no longer feels like fortnite, it feels like a shittier version of codmw and has crappy power ups as any other game. This is just my opinion tho still passes the time but no longer has the uniqueness as it once did when dc/Star Wars/icon/marvel, especially marvel series item weren’t a thing, now it feels like (sorry for being crude) epic is jerking off disney so they can use new marvel characters.
What if the herald is dead but there's still a little of bit of chrome life inside her
The monster came back
6:20 could be teenage mutant ninja turtles?
0:26 actually this happend to me in chapter 2  2:47 i found fast car in this chapter and season.
I don't think meowscles is hiding. He can come from rifts
The fastest car in the game is not whiplash, it's the io car 🙂
I actually accidentally found 3 llamas
L rocky reals
No way they forgot hulk 💀
I already knowed the ice ball trick
The only fucking thing that would make the story interesting again is if Midas somehow comes back
Giannis was somehow in on of the trailers
RIP
Rip risky reels
Can't wait until they put Dirt Bikes into creative
I like calling the new slap juice "MONSTER ENERGY"
i was thinking back to my favourite season, chapter 2 season 2, when i remembered something. Does anyone remember the XP coins you could find around the map? And how the purple one threw out little coins
I kinda wish that fortnite would add fortnite icons that I asked for specifically...
what has fortnite become
Bro on my first game I found the triple llama spawn because it just popped in front of me and my second game I found the safe area with a bunch of different safes
they copied reinharts shield from overwatch
GG Videos & streams rolling out! Killing it with Ch4 content, Tommy! W
what happend to bunker in chapter near foundation statue and rave cave bunker
This chapter is so freaking epic!!!
I got 4 lamas🤩
What about jones? Is he dead
The fastest cars was a Ferrari in fortnite
The rift thing happened to me
R.I.P risky reels  man that was the only place that i always landed  and now its gone for good  :')
Daily uploads ❤❤❤
I got 4 llama so dame lucky
I found a triple lama one day ago
I have always been on io's side, so im glad to see they are back.
risky gone... IM Nothing!!!!😭😢
While the doom slayer is doing the toy emote he is in first person mode so I am guessing that must be hinting to first person
R.I.P risky/rocky
the spheres are not indestructible, destroy the base and they will disappear
Rip
wait doom is here now?!?!?!?!?! im going back to fortnite
bro forgot my hero \
The sad part is that doom slayer doesn't have his unicorn style
Left out the new Secret rifle only one in the game
Cool :D
RIP
Found the three llamas freaked me out
I saw the storm shield logo on the battle bus is save the world finally important? nahhhh probably not
👎Like to say rip rocky 😢
The three lalma spawn happened to me andi was play trios we all got max mats
Rip 🪦 risky reels
I LOVE CHAPTER 4
7:50 looks like the darwin drone
RIP😢
Do you guys think that the doom slayer emote going into first person in the trailer is teasing first person.
G b
Y
the guy from kreckcrafts  stream lol
HEI TOPGAMING VI UN VIDEO DE QUE UN CANAL TE ESTABA COPIANDO VOS NO SOS LADRON ES SOLAMENTE UNA ADVERTENCIA
I got 3 llamas 2 times i was how the is this possible
I thing the golden style for the Doomslayer should’ve been the last one to unlock since it’s the hardest version to unlock in the game
The Reality warriors reminded me of guardians of the galaxy,fortnite should do another guardians of the galaxy crossover like upgraded star lord skin considering the new season is like realities collapsed together.
Bro i love driving the dirt bikes around and also i thought the sword gun was bad but I was so wrong its so good
I don't want the other guy icon skin I want mrbeast and that why 8 came to chapter 4 because of mrbeast
The swirled markings remind me of the doctor strange franchise so it could be one of those clues
Doom guy is the best skin in the game now all those 12 year old and other who don’t know what doom is will know now doom is the grandfather of fps rip and tear boys!
The drone in the trailer. Come on a drone you can fly. That is awesome
Anyone else surprised that the doom slayer isn’t tier 100?
I haven’t seen anyone talk about how in the trailer the doom skin uses the emote and then goes into first person and I think that could mean first person is coming out soon
rip
hi tomy can u pls gift me the battle pass pls pls pls my user is PhantomGod3122
I got the triple llama
People still play this game
If there's an advancement in the game and "no on is talking about it" - odds are it is meant to have you buy into fast food.... McDonald's, Burger King.... prove me wrong. And so this channel is yet another shameless channel playing into - unintentionally - schemes to make us all fat to but into some bottom lines of corporations.
The slap juice and slurp juice is so similar to the Hydrox vs Oreo story. For people who don’t know hydrox was the original sandwich cookie but Oreo copyied them with a better ad campaign to get the most of hydrox’s customers. Or it’s just epic wanting to test a knew company that works too
rip

R.I.P
Sova: 👁👄👁
Rip
The fact that doom slayer isn't ripping charecterrs heads off is the most disappointed aspect i so wanted to rip off Spiderman's 🤣
ah yes, the super secret in fortnite, doom slayer being in the game. fascinating
Are you the son of Mr. Top 5?
I actually found the first secret but it was just wildcard with 4 vending machines. edit: I am not sure but I think if you have visualize sound effects you can hear it.
Man they really forgot about the bunker under the Foundation statue huh.
@CoryxKenshine si si si👽👽👽👽👽
What if they add tesla
the henchmen is rare?? lol i got that on my first game
RIP
The Heralds tree is broken in the back, maybe the Herald escaped?
rip and I am hyped for the update😂
can you gift me the battel pass my name is ksdxcaln2k
I just got a triple llama
RIP to rocky reles
AH CRAP FORTNITE GONNA TURN INTO WARZONE BECAUSE THE UNREAL ENGINE 5.1 AND THE RIOT SHELID I BET PEOPLE GONNA TROLL AND GET THE RIOT SHEILD AND CAMP IN A CORNER
I got the henchman encounter on my second game. They where by a campfire in the cold so I light it, emoted, and walked away
rip rocky
You have been talking about mha for a while but as soon as it’s teased you say nothing
"1 car has Been removed" Octane: am I a joke to you?
people who encountered the triple llama   👇👇
RIP you will be loved
Bro I don’t care that German content creater got a icon skin we need a Tommy to get a skin
I don't think the imagine order is fully back I think they just used pieces from imagine order stuff to make the launch pad
4:21, is anyone gonna realize that doom slayer is in FIRST PERSON! Maybe coming soon?
Rip rocky
I saw some of the henchman‘s
I caught the sports car too but I wonder if it will be like the Ferrari a collab rip
german?? i thought he was brazilian
Jelly Angler has already been nerfed 😂
Where Typical gamer skin at😢
I caught the car too maybe it's not the car was going to be added but it could be a hit for a new like the Ferrari rip
WHERES MY NICK EH 30 SKIN THO???
The whiplash wasn’t the fastest, the IO cars were
is it possible for miles morals bring released this season?
Can’t wait for a Tommy icon skin!
Who else remembers fred
So we’re not gonna learn what was in the bunker under the foundation statue?
You forgot about the MHA skin that was shown in the trailer
Congrats on flakes but we have nickeh30, typical gamer, top5gaming, etc that still don’t have a icon skin but this random gets one? Doesn’t make any sense to me
There’s also one of those little coral guys in the snow biome in a kayak next to a log cabin
I found tilted towers in the snow part
FORTNITE also announced they were collaborating with Gianis Antantacombo.( I can’t spell sorry )
Imagine sweating at Rocket league  *sweats nervously
now that i think about it, we never saw what was behind the door in the statue of the foundation
4:40 it honestly sucks. one time i did 210 damage to guy who had no shield. i miss the old version
The battle bus turned into an Elon Musk rocket 💀
Mrbeast in trailer at 0:50 in the epic games account
Fortnite just copped Overwatch's rinhard shield
Thanks for the video bro! Recently I have been making Fortnite videos for my channel, and to now see it's all revamped is just exciting! I can't wait to see some of these hidden secrets here soon :)
no chapter 3 risk reels was my favorite poi
Bro you need a icon skin tbh ❤
Gianiss is also coming to fortnite
Tommy: The chapter 1 music plays when you discover a new poi!  Me: Has Every Single piece of the new chapter discovered and I didn't have my volume up.
Claim your “here within 1d” achievement for your 30 gamerscore 😂❤
4:55 all this time, i assumed he was either King Arthur or some "Witcher" boss.
The car in the poster looks like a rocket league car
Correct me if I'm wrong but the shields look very similar to some of the shields used in overwatch
rip
Rip
When I looked at the Battle pass saw tear 100 I knew the streak was broken
R.I.P
rip
People with p:  Pod Peter Phaggy Poku Peffy
That's why I can't find a whiplash
8:07  german? thats clearly spanish
Pretty sure that is a gtr Ik alot about cars and by the look of the spoiler and the fact that it is drifting it looks like
the last original tier 100 skin was Cube queen was it not?
They didn't just bring the henchmen bros back, but the whole squad with the trespasser, IO, and Seven agents are back too. I got a rift encounter next to Scattered Slabs
Rip
Deadpool gonna be back?!?
I think the Reality Warriors consist of the members of the Seven that are left along with Jones and most likely some new members
Top 5 gaming did you hear you can run when drinking slap juice pls put this in a video
That wall / riot shield reminds me of the carcass walls from Doom Eternal!
Slap juice 😂
first person mode???? 4:20
My brother and I were thinking about it, because the map is so small right now (nine POI's instead of the 12+ the old map had), they could honestly pull the land masses that are om the outside of the map inwards to make it larger. It would be wild, "they've been teasing this POI since the beginning, we just didn't know it yet!"
Rip
The riot shield in the trailer looks like the tank dude from overwatch’s shield
is anybody going to see that in the trailer when the doom emote was going it was in first person.
This is one of the first seasons I’ve seen in a long time where almost nobody has any major complaints. Let’s just hope they can keep this up later into the chapter :)
broo when i saw the drone thing the first thing is said is broo thats sovas owl that funny how u mentioned it
Thanks for talking about the random rift spawners.. i was confused and trying to tell my friends was annoying
What’s the weapon at 0:23 in the first and third slot?
Bro got a Reinhardt sheild
I play valorent and I wanna say that drone is sovas drone basically but chamber being Midas that just seems like a coincidence
“German content creator” Him being Brazilian:💀
I got the triple llama in my first game of the season
Tommy what do you think of mr Beast being the winterfest skin👀👀
God bless to the 1% who see this comment
7:24 Ehh, I don't recommend it actually. In a situation where you're in one of these rooms, and the high DPS storm is coming, chances are that you're f***ed. It's easier to get in than to get out, because the hole in the tile wall that you sneaked in through, has these tiny ridges around them that blocks you from being able to crouch-walk through it back to the outside. The only way is to break the wall, and as I said, you could be trapped inside with the storm at 8+ DPS... It just happened to me actually. Way too risky imo. 🙅‍♂️
wait think about it, hard core gamer with stacks of pizza boxes? Maby just Maby
Is no one gonna talk about first person doom guy in the trailer?
2:00 what song is that
But wheres the rest of the hench group?
I got the 3. Llamas
they stole the drone from apex legends because the character crypto uses it
Hi
Im sorry to say but Flakes Power its brazilian from brazil in south america, he is not german @Top5Gaming
I loved rocky reels. Rip 😔
I saw an oro npc
I found two llamas at once
I REALLY hope that doom slayer will also have a unicorn style as in the actual doom games.
6:04 Which is exactly how I liked it. 🤷‍♂️
Well if the seven is gone and a new 7 is here it means no rock,visitor, scientist, cube king.rip🤧😭🖤
Hi Top5Gaming I love this and I hope you have a good day and you are awesome
Ngl but I found 3 llamas on an gas station
Can u make a video about klombo? 😢
Rip
Now imagine the slap juice legends😅
I found the triple lama on my first game, pretty early on in the round. I thought they just simply added more lamas
5:55 RIP Risky/Rocky Reels. 😔✊🔥
i seen that sports car picture today CRAAAAAZZZYYY LOL
RIP
I feel this new chapter has officially destroyed Fortnite the graphics are good and the best original tier 100 but the guns r to over powered  and theirs to many spray guns, Fortnite could be awesome with less spray guns. I also think their should be less guns because by the time u  land someone will have a spray gun or a thunder shotgun, straight away your dead.    THEIR EVERYWERE.  Maybe its just me but I don't think fortnite has a good future.
The doomslayer emote on the trailer features first person view btw.
That shield has gotta be one of the augments
I think the zero point is under the herald tree
The recon drone reminds me of the eagles (and raven) from recent AC games.
Rip
rip slurp juice
Valorent it is called chamber but in fortnite  it is called midas
So, if doom guy made it to the game from the leak, family guy has a 50/50 chance of getting added. I doubt it, but it’s obvious
New slap juice skins 😳 like slurp skins but it’s slap juice
Hey I have something I want to say Fortnite the trailer teased first person when he did the emote the fish bump his little toy self it showed him in first person
I saw the triple llama spawn!  We saw two llamas but then a third one popped out I was like wtfff
I found a little igloo with oil drums and a sleeping bag with a chest
RIP
I think the ageless is a snapshot of geno if you look at the ageless description it calmed that he is a snapshot
4:16 I've never played the Doom games, and even I can confidently admit that this looks absolutely badass! The black one is my favorite by far! 😍🖤🔥
RIP Risky Reels
We don't talk about the drill
Yo guys is anyone gonna talk about the bird gadget similar to the remote Rocket launcher
RIP
RIP
I hate the damage adding like that
Rip
Found the purple cube on a desk at the frozen labs or town beside it.
R.I.P
There was a secret tank floating in there trailer for a short time and I think slone is in there because she was in the tank when she got smashed by the mecha team leader 😳
I think they will add a new mythic because in the trailer deku destroyed a builds whit his finger so I think that there going to be adding a mythic when he comes
Hey another icon series skin is Giannis antetoknmpo
The spheres are the exact same spheres as the one in front of the agency
Rip
T5G- We’re glad to finally have Doom in the game. Also T5G: Where is the Family Guy collab, another troll by Fortnite
4:40 there’s a setting for that if you wanna turn it off
W Chapter 4
I’m calling it now, we’re gonna get a Slap legends, or perhaps a Slap series skin in the future.  Yes, I’m aware of how random that is.
rip
TMNT Mikey??
there was no sports car but that sheild weapon reminds me of the medisheild from tf2
R.I.P
BRUH I just realized that when they do the doom emote the character is in first person. So this is our second look at first person and it might actually come this season🎉
Fun fact: the tower in the big ice hut thing before the ice hut IS rave cave, but way more icy
I got the triple llama
rip risky reels 😭😭😭
I just realized that means the chapter 2 map is distorted too..
Why does the battle pass only go up to lvl 94 ? 🤨🤨
Also don’t forget about dr slone. (She’s still probably in the water somewhere)
Fun fact the ageless is a snapshot of geno
its been so long since original tier 100 i thought the tier 100 was a collab skin when i first saw the battlepass
Rip
Chapter 3 was boring honestly but I know this chapter is gonna be the BEST
Chapter 4 is poo
Wasnt it confirmed by Epic that Dr. Slone wouldnt return after collision? Meh, not that big of a deal.
In my first game I was playing trios with my friends and we got the triple llamas and we were so confused
T5G, the cube queen was after the primal season so I think she was the last original tier 100
See i believe the main problem with Chapter 3 is it was so huge that you almost never saw anyone til end game, and when tilted was back EVERYONE landed at it (myself included) as much as i enjoyed Chapter 3 i believe 4 is already wayyy better me and my best friend are loving the new weapons and mechanics (shotguns not included)
I don’t have any gaming devices
have just found this out. If you go to the season 7 contrail snowflakes they have updated it.
I love how the scars are every variety!
😨😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 mommy 👩 come here l'm SAD 😔
rip rocky  reels
Hey remember the ice king and that lava king guy well maybe there’s more of people like and their called reality warriors
RIP RUSKY REALS
quick theory: I think slurp and slap corporations may have a trade war that escaltes and has them starting to fight making you pick sides like ghost and shadow
That is not where the 0 point is it's under frozen water and you can see it Glow in the frozen water 0 point is not there it could be in like the lights flexing out there but I seen it
You forgot about deku in the new release s
Rip
The pizza box stack in the barn house reminds me of Dante from dmc and he was also in the new fortnite survey so hopes up
The reason the Whiplash was removed is because of the augment that made it so you didn’t use fuel.
RIP :(
I wish we could have slap juice splashes
On the spawn island the bus start up
They removed battle lab
Where’s the mr beast burger thing in the thumbnail?
RIP 😊
MR BEAST BURGER OH FUIVCK YEA
R.I.P
The new 8 looks like some of the seven like how the guy from doomslayerr looks like the scientists
THE MAP IS FLAT EARTH
Wait why did dooms emote go first person mode
Do u know when first person comes?
okay but can we discuss that the doomslayer emote in the trailer is in first person??? uhhh..... first person is COMING, boys
I'm so tired of slone
I feel like this new chapter has been a major refresher in Fortnite, and definitely adds some gameplay aspects that make it so much more interesting.
Rip risky reels
the new supercar isnt a sedan. Its a toyato supra I think, or a mitsubishi or some kind. Idk im not THAT into cars, I just happen to know a couple
R.i P 😢😢😢😢
Ngl the live event was very bad like all the hype for a bad event
I am extremely disappointed that they didn't add a lobby track for DOOM music.
R.I.P
Seen 3 Llamas .. Appearing out of nowhere along wid a rock jst as shown in d video .. a match ago ..in which me n my team wont ..  ( I started hearing a weird crackng sound around and a rift sound , dats wen llama appeared)
Finally an Original Tier 100, not a collab...
fortnite fortnite fortnite
I love fortnite
Why u gotta clickbait bro
You do so good on predicting and finding out! Keep the good work goin T5G! BTW I’m a BIG fan!
The riot shield is reference to one of the doom monsters
What happen to jonesy
I found two llamas I found the lonely henchman 2
Did you know chapter 4 is chapter one  themed
rip
Also if you look at map upside it’s sorta like the chapter 1 map like lonley labs is where frosty flights was and slapped shores is where snobby shores and frenzy field and anarchy actes
So we're just going to brush over 'the nothing'? Remember that bytes passed the trials/tests to become a warrior and the 'nothing has' yet to show up! The Visitor said 'The Nothing' is inevitable and given that the zero point is still intact that means 'The Nothing' is still to make an appearance
rip
Clam shut up tickets
The ageless is a snapshot of geno it say it in his description
Yup
when will midas come
I like the new red-eye assault rifle it's been pretty good
The Part In the trailer when doom slayer fist bumps the toy it is in first person do you think this might be teasing first person
If too 5 gaming pins this, he is a god *and a legend
Still waiting for tg's icon skin rip
I wonder where no sweat insurance is...
You have the best videos, Tommy
Bro said Flakespower is a german creator but when you look all his content is in spanish haha 8:06
R.I.P Risky we well remember you!
I’m happy that the tier 100 skin is finally original
Bet
Rip
Hi
Rip
Fortnite Youtubers always be Clickbaiting and make 845 videos in one season and why did they skip six seasons for the next chapter fortnight is trying too hard I wouldn’t be surprised if Fortnite chapter 5 is the next season
Me who started my first game of chapter 4 and having the henchman spawn where I landed. The final zone was at the place where I landed and had them spawn and I was with them the entire time. I ended up winning, so I consider my first win of chapter 4 a trio win lol
So that means to handle the store live if you look in the back of the reality tree she broke out of the back of it
If you look in the back of the Herald corpse you can see A whole that means the hell broke out it is somewhere on our Island
The painting under the water actually looks like the wizard of Oz’s yellow brick road. The fantasy theme would blend well with the current map
Click bait, where is the MrBeast burger?
Thanks for the snowball tip. Imma use that to get #27 victory royale
Hold up ok where is the hulk
Clain your "After an hour" ticket right here 🎟️
If only there was a mrbeast burger poi i really want it
I’m 90% sure the recon drone is based on bloodhound from apex
FLAKES POWER IS AN BRAZILIAN YOUTUBER, NOT AN GERMAN YOUTUBER AAAAAAA
Him: the fastest car has been removed. Me: Oh, the octane. Him:ThE WiPlAsH!!
for the sown ball my friend miss clicked and that happen so he did it more then jumped in the snow ball and showed me it
Rip risky reels
Apologies to Flakes Power! He is not a German content creator but the largest content creator in Brazil, congrats on the icon skin!
If you look at that place one more time that had the clock towel from tilted it looks like the monster from the live event from the robot
Ok the reality warriors’s leader better be John Cena
You can see that you go in first person in the trailer when you play with the doom toy
I think we're building amie a body this chapter
not surprised the whiplash is gone not many roads on the new map so they would be really slow
It's the ageless and the rest of the battle pass characters
ah yes lets forget deku from MHA
Fun fact: the Ageless is a snapshot
R.I.P RISKY REELS Prayers for Risky Reels 👇
No one's talking about Mr beast having a quest 2 controller on his hip
Dr Slone appears on the trailer or the en of the event She Is sitting in a red telephone booth in the background Well at least I’m pretty sure that’s her
I got a rift encounter once and I got three lama’s but only killed one and damaged the other ones half health
I found the triple llama and it’s op for me
i feel like i am the only one that thinks the citadel looks alot like akkala citadel from BoTW and that the shockwave hammer jump and slam looks like the two handed weapons ZR move on age of calamity and i am most likely right, i just want a the legend of zelda collab
i think slurp is better than slap
You forgot the tiny snow mounds they are good spots to hide out plus they have chests
Top 5 gaming. Flake Power is a brazinlan YouTube
Below me is bruh
apparently this season and chapter are the beginning of the IO according to Donald
Rip in the chat
They removed the whiplash cause of the perk infinite fuel so you could have boost the whole game and never stop
Why is the map kight themed if this season is all reality's colled
8:00 flakes power is brazilian fortnite content creator not german
I think I preferred the old damage numbers honestly
R.I.P rocky
rip :( my fave spot
fun fact: Epic Games has fully embraced the Lonely Henchmen and during the Fracture event there is a Telescope Task where you had to find them and there were called the Hench-Bros
4:21 in this part of the trailer I noticed that the emote is in first person,  so what if this was a teaser for first pearson in chapter 4
i had the tipple lamas spawn happen my first and second game  what r the odds
he's Brazilian
I think i found Mewoscles from a rift, he was emoting at 4 vending machines
RIP😭
It would be really cool if they added a spike wheel mod for vehicles so they don’t slide on the ice
❤
Where is typical gamers icon series!?!
Has anyone decoded the morse code by the battle bus on spawn island?
I SAW THE HIDDEN SPORTS CAR AS WELL
JackAxolotl found a glitch use party augment and shokwave hammer once you have 3 balloons bounce charge and fly to youre death
In the trailer of the doom slayer fist bump thing he is in first person mode
Flakes power is brazilian 🇧🇷
Has anybody else noticed how much smoother the game feels, or is it just me? That, and I've been able to run graphics on epic with no issues!
I think whiplash got removed because one of the new augments supercharged makes it so your car doesnt run out of fuel which would be broken for the whiplash's boost
Bro chill the season only drop for 2 days 💀💀
I knew about the snow ball thing
German??!!
Tommy do you swear just asking?
Flakes power is brazilan dude
There are a few people in my schools that say “Fortnite is soooooo bad” even though they have no evidence of this this. I hate these people. Fortnite rules!!
HEY!! Flakes Power its a brazilian content creator not german :P keep up the good content <3
Him: the fate of an important character   Me: PEELY
I also encountered loveless and the henchmen
Me and my friend found 1 llama than not even 2 minutes later another then we found a double llama we found 4 llamas in a duo game
Their should have been slurp vs chrome
We finally got a skin of a Brazilian YouTuber and you say he's German..Omg. Flakes Power Is from BRAZIL
The third time I played a match I got the triple lama spawn
Meowseoles came out of a rift yesterday with lots of yarn
if you jump off the spawn island before you spawn into the battle bus, you can see a random 6 trees fenced in floating in the air under the spawn island! idk if its a bug or an easter egg
Reality warriors😒 cringe names
8:07 he’s a brazilian not german (sorry, to be that guy)
I think the whiplash has been removed bc it would b op to infinitly boost (infinite fuel)
Is the slurp to slap juice kinda like prime vs Gatorade
Early
Anyone knows if the bot lobbies work  with the phone method
As much as your semi click bait thumbnails do I enjoy your content
❤❤❤❤R I P❤❤❤❤ Rocky Reels we will miss you I loved your POI hopefully you come back to us
The new map is giving…… Genshin impact
I'm mean I'm in within a hour

Yo Top5Gaming, I have a 31st secret for this video, the Tents have been removed.
Flakespower is not german, he is brazilian.
hello
3:00 🤓 actually their names are Bill and Ted. PlayStation Grenade said so.
Wonder when will klombo be back
i have the og soundtrack as a music track cause iv played since season 1
Are we going to ignore the fact that the seven sentry the alien and the io Guard that hanged out with the henchmen are gone
No one noticed that they removed battle labs
R.I.P
Fortnite Fortnite Fortnite I love you ^⁠_⁠^
The new shotgun blast thing is amazing
Risky reels left the chat
If u jump of the spawn island and look under it u can see trees
I found the 2 henchmen
Ok so I think shadow and ghost may re emerge because of meowscles and the other secret rooms in the bastion they could be hiding there until they can re emerge
What about the random grassy chunk with the gas station at in the snowy part of the map
My question is are we still having a story line with the seven, The foundation is wasn’t consumed by the chrome, he was looking for Geno and I don’t think the ageless is Geno because the foundation would of been back then
RIP Risky Reels
How do you get the recon drone
Tg still hasn't gotten his skin yet
Valorant also took the skin from season 9 chapter 1 I forget his name but he had fire powers
Rip for risky reels
Anyone notice ,the ice around the clock tower forms the monsters head
Who else wants the old  battle pass design back
Comment 715
Yo man love the vid but I'm not too sure that flakes power is from Germany as you said near the end
Hold up what????
Risky Reels has always been my fav POI
Miawsecels is on the map
I got jumpscared by the 2 henchman just randomly rifting in front of me vibin
When you realize that they only included 29/30 easter eggs that they said they would
Both stair gliders are dumb
Flakes power is portuguese!! Not german!

rip risky reels
Flakes power is from Brazil
6:28 Can that be a teaser for a teenage mutant ninja turtles colab cause mickey loves pizzas
Flakes power is brazilian not german
I hope that they add Slap skins (e.g. Slap Bandolette, Slap Jonesy and Slap Leviathan
We all remember in chapter 2 there was a lighthouse let us remind us of the memories of the lighthouse
RIP rocky
Theyre adding anyone to the icon series💀 I wont be surprised if im next
I can't believe they did nothing with the devourer skeleton In chapter 3. They must of just forgot.
dude flakes is not german is brazilian
Bro flakes is brazilian how did your scrip get it so wrong
Been here since chapter 2  👇🏽
You Forgot about the stuff about my hero academia
Also Giannis was confirmed
Yah
They probably removed the whiplash because of the unlimited fuel mod, buff thing so that would lead to unlimited boosting
Ah that makes sense I found the llamas and thought I’d broke some world record 😂
Fortnite needs to fix the stair gliders. It’s so annoying it looks like their jogging and makes the entire thing feel less royal/grand/good. I mean the cube queen is a literal queen and her jogging isn’t ok. Same goes for geno and all other bossy/king/queen skins.
Claim your earlier than an hour ticket
ive had 4 lammas
Whenever I watch your videos I think hey this seasons not bad so thank you Tommy AND KEEP IT UP
giannis akumpo
Flakes Power is from Brazil

in the live event, everything was floating in space, but then how did we get the atmosphere and water?
😃
I have a theory that when doctor Sloan was crushed by the Mac she fell into the zero point and now she has some type of powers as the skin looks like a
Season 5 is a new chapter
Wasn't Flakes Power brazilian? His content is in Portuguese, and if I'm not mistaken, he lives in Brazil
My mom and dad are fighting to who ever is reading this please pray they don😢
Tg found the lamas
It’s only been like 2 days and there’s already lore
Flakes power is a Brazillian YouTuber!
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
I would just like to say rip rocky reels. But on that not I hope every body has a great new chapter.🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
Didn't get to see what was underneath the statue of the foundation
It would be cool when the season progresses the island would expand and meteor would crash into the island and expand
8:07 bro he is Spain……
Flakes Power is not German, he is brazilian.
FLAKES POWER IS BRAZILIAN
Geno looks alot like lotor from voltron if anyone has seen it
One of the locations in the map has speakers that play chapter 1 lobby music
I had 3 lomu
I’m so excited to see what happens next in the season especially with MrBeast hopefully he does a secret skin gift where he gifts people who subscribe to him
Anyone else having problems with people who have infinite health? Need answers
Use code T5G!
5:55 rip
I don’t know if this is the reason but whiplash got added into rocket league I think that’s why they put all the rocket league posters up

The picture of the sedan is also in the manor south west of Frenzy Fields
I still wish we found out what was inside the I.O vault at rave cave
wheres the beast burger easter egg
Nobody knows about the snowball trick?  Huh?  Everyone was talking about it, & snowballing yesterday T5G
Yay
I think the Reslity Warriors are going to be snapshots of the seven. Thoughts?🤔
Ooo

Flakes Power isn't German! He's Brazilian!
Tommy you messed up
35 mins ago
Flakes power is brazilian dude
The YouTuber is Brazilian
Just a correction  Flakes Power is not German He is a Brazilian
YOU HAVE MAIL
I think slone will come with the new sand biome since her new skin looks sandy
Flakes Power os Brazilian
R.I.P
Rip
First they add a big hammer,next a big shield that’s energy??? They are stealing Reinhart from overwatch
I love how all the colors pop out it really feels like your playing a new game with graphics mod installed
The seven x reality warriors
I CAN FINALLY PROVE TO MY BROTHER MRBEAST IS IN FORTNITE!!!
Hi I love your video
I’m just waiting for the Top5gaming icon skin
What do we have to do to finally take down the io
I know this isn’t really a “secret” but they still have the Ukraine crates but it’s sideways instead of sticking up by t u forgot where it is
Hi all! Who loves the new chapter? If you want to be anonymous you can leave your vote on my community tab!
I got meowscles in one of the rift I counters today
cooool
I love that Fortnite’s finally taking its self seriously enough to make one of its own original characters the tier 100 this season And not relying on other brands to build hype
My face😑 My soul😁 My dad  Random chair 🪑

Did you realise that the launch pads are still called io launch pads
6:38 that’s look like my car in GTA all that car needs a Air horn for the car horn and blue paint that’s my car right there
Rip
Great vid
Did he just called flakes Power German content creator 💀
26 minutes
Flakes power Isn't German, he's brazilian
am I the only one that saw the lonely henchmens entire group with the seven sentry and some sleeping bags?
I feel like they also remove the whiplash because it would be too powerful with the augment that gives your car infinite fuel
how is no one talking about how the trailer it goes into first person for the doom emote that means first person is coming out very soon
Im so relieved that someone actually called out the rifts that appear in the start of the vid 💀💀
rip
Yep
Keep up the good work! Love your vids
08:06 Flakes Power is not a german content creator xD
Claimed
I don’t care what people say, chapter 4 is a smash hit so far. The graphics are beautiful, we have the best original tier 100 of all time, motorcycles, and finally scars back. This map is really good, and I hope everyone’s having a good time.
sex
R.i.p risky reals :(
Flakes power is actually Brazilian !
Rip
Are you going to do how to get to level 100 again

I’m just angry battle lab was removed…

I KNEW THAT STONE CIRCLE WAS FOR SOMETHING
Hey top five gaming I got a 3 Llamas
FLAKES POWER IS BRAZILIAN, NOT GERMAN

Flakes power is Brasiliense 😡
Rip
Anyone reading this have a nice day
This season is good
Hhh
We need to get risky reels back.
Fishstick rifted infront of me and gave me like 5 chests 😂
the cave is shaped like the devourer skull 2:24
Hey y'all remember Deadpool being in every trailer for fortnite? I haven't seen him since chapter 2 season 5, where is my man?
I heard if you say your favorite YouTuber 3 times you get  Top5gaming Top5gaming Top5gaming
Meowcles died in one of the events.
Same day ticket here if u weren’t here in an hour (reply to claim)🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
So i wasnt the only one who saw them
rip
i saw the devourer
Wow I am early
I actually was really surprised when I saw the tree with a statue of the herald connected to it
The rockets and the foundation door was still not uncovered. I hate the route epic took but the season is great!
8:07 no Tommy, Flakes Power is Brazilian
I LOVE TOMMY FROM TOP 5 GAMING I WILL KEEP IT HERE WITH YOU FOREVER
Hi
Flakes Power is Brazilian not German💀
8:06 He isn't german, He is Brazilian. and also im' pretty sure the Bastion is a reference to the cultist base (snow level) in Doom Eternal
Can't wait for Mrbeast to be a boss in the game holding the mythic money gun
Are we all just ignoring the My Hero Academia collab coming with a one for all mythic too?!
Herr aften 14 min
t5g be like: A new chapter released and no one noticed! 😮😮😮🙄
God loves u have a great day!!
R.I.P risky
I broke my switch so I can’t play for a wile😢
Rip Risky Reels (Season 4 - Season 22)
Is No one gonna Talk Abt how flakes Power isnt German Like He said
R.I.P rockey reels
R.I.P.❤
R I P
I really didn't liked the graphics this season, they became too realistic.
I also got a triple llama spawn
We need more original tier 100 skins
We all know Nick eh 30 is going to do a 100 player custom with the snowball… lol
A pile of pizza boxes? And games? Teenage mutant turtles confirmed
Quick theory:  The herald that is molded into the tree could point at stuff like a live events or villains, so maybe keep an eye out on that
Bro, the added Reinhardt’s shield
Anyone who sees a have a have a great day God bless
I don't want to look rude or something but Flakes Power is a brasilian content creator, not german
Its been 1 day?!
Bro said flakes is a german youtuber 💀 he's spanish bro
it has been to long you need a skin
If the 7 story does end it'll be hard to say goodbye to them and have a new version of them
My theory about the clock tower is that if the ice melts around it people will come and build a new tilted around it.
The suped up sedan built like a rip off mach-e
Keep it up
Rip rocky.

Maybe the reality warrior is a faction of warriors from countless realities and the seven are part of them
Anybody going to talk about deku skin
Who else loves when t5g uploads? It makes a good day :)
Look closer at the heralds tree cause she aint there anymore she escaped there is a hole in the tree
I found the 3 llamas on the ice biom
Yay
I theorize that whiplash cars were removed due to the new augment that allows infinite fuel. So if someone had the Augment then they would have infinite boosters on their car
Man keeps amazing us keep it up tp5gaming
I freaking love slap juice it reminds me of monster energy mango favor 😋😂
I love the new chapter!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Rip
R.I.P
Rip risky reels

Rip risky reels 😢
My theory about the clock tower is that if the ice melts around it people will come and build a new tilted around it.
I hate how in chapter 3 the Devourer skull could’ve been removed and nothing would change.
fortnite CHAPTER 4🤩
Where's klombo :(
Rip
anyone else think the icy thing the tilted clock tower is in looks like the skull of the ice monster?
Are you guys still at the island
You should have shown overstrands 3 lama spawn
I cannot forget these things now
I really wish I could get the candy axe
I think Kolmbo will come back but as a skeleton
2 knights dancing on a go-kart
The Fracture Live Event was borderline unacceptable, and I'm sorry that Epic tied you, Sypher and Typical to that garbage event and yall had to sit there and act like you were playing something fun : /
If you look at the back of the herald tree there is a big hole.  I wonder if that means the herald is somewhere out ther still
The chores about a new chapter is to discover the island so I’m doing just the entire map rn
Love the video❤
Is it just me or does the new map need more POI's
I stopped playing fortnight for awhile yet this new chapter is amazing and got me back into the game!
All of your videos I love them

First P.S, IDK if I’m the only one who spotted this but in the Doom emote, the description sounds like Dory in Finding Nemo when she is with the Jellyfish. She names the Jellyfish “Squishy” and she says that exact line! Could it be a hidden Easter Egg?
