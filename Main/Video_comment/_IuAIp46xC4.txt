Sampha’s voice is angelic❤❤❤
This song has helped so many men.
Tragic
GOAT
I love this song my dad helped me thru the river off love in the kingdomofGod
https://youtu.be/ROUFkWceDRM?si=K637K2xmvSUWJQEt
holy fuck this is actually live
😢
The fact people labeled this album as weak is insane to me. This was such a deep ass album if you understood the lyrics. If you looking for Hype content we all know where we go for that
the walls closing on him, now that's art
Spiritual 😢❤
U really are the greatest artist of all time
Mr.Morale and the big steppers is the perfect example of just being yourself can turn into something beautiful
ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT HOW HE got the "when you heart is made of stone" line wrong?
I love how he stepped back and let Sampha do his job
Sampha 💙
The sheep will never overstand
❤❤
Anyone wants to hear sampha ft weeknd?
Sampha is amazing 😍
plus, how niqqas Cyperinn' without uncle LL acting🩷/💜🎭 w/all those pausiie movements 💅🏾🥰
At first i didnt even notice that the room got smaller
Sampha was just perfect for this song beautiful voice man
https://youtu.be/_IuAIp46xC4?feature=shared  all politics aside, I relate to this song 🙁
*The way he just bodies every performance is alien.*
This is actually sick
“Bills have no silver spoon”…. 😮
Hello 2025 😮😊🎉
Interesting to see that generally speaking, on Kendricks videos, people are talking about Kendrick! On Drake's videos, people are talking about Kendrick!
This is has to be the most unique performance
Amazing performance!!
Let's goooo ❤️✨
There was unneeded sensors here, but still great
This guy 🔥
I’ve been struggling with some personal Daddy issues that re-surfaced through therapy. This song brings healing - I’m learning how to lead my family with a healed heart.
I t is replying
mr morale is by far his best album
Man should never show feelings being sensitive never helped.. his mama died I asked why he going back to work so soon he said son that life bills got no silver..dat shxt got me 😢
This is TALENT! I just wish Sampha had a bit more to say....
"My life is plot, twisted from directions that i cant see"
I love this performance
❤️🙌
it’s 2am. this is freaky. please leave me alone 😂😭😊
he has so much aura
they're both so good live and so clearly feeling the song. it seems so simple but denotes a clear depth of talent.
Nobody complementing Sampha's voice...so Angelic 😮
Was ready throw my hands,  A foolish's pride.
I would have loved to have an snl version of Die hard too
I personally think this is the best produced song ever. Yep you heard me. Fight me i dare.
Never realized the Kanye/drake bar till just now
This is the kind of live performance that's worth every fvcking dime. He will give you what you paid for and more. A true generational talent.  You see every artist can do what Drake can do. But there are only a small portion of artists can do what Dot can do. That tells you a lot when it comes to real talent.
In the parallel stories. Kendrick shows organic authentic love. No pomp and circumstance. Just a raw emotional connection with someone in the ups and downs of life.  SZA's portrayal in the beginning is opposite. Walked  into the hotel dressed provocatively knocking on the door to meet up with the Drake lookalike is more of a physical connection like how Drake treats women. Eventually at the end she experiences the emotional connection like Kendrick did.
So no one talking bout Sampha?
I wish Pac made it to SNL. 😢 With kendrick would be dope too.
Who's here after the drop of Luther?
You go to a comedy show to laugh and get out thinking about therapy. Kendrick again sending people into an introspective state during their fight for escapism.
So ROMANTIC!!!!❤
Flex with the Luther clearance at the end 💰💰💰💰
🐐🔥
Tough love is tough
Drake never...
So,drake saw this guy and tough ‘let’s fight this man’😅
One of the best Kendrick songs ever. Can't deny Kendrick Lamar been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥
2025 let's gether here
SFOTS
The Symbolism of the Walls Closing in DEEP AF
Please put this song on Spotify
02:50
Classic
That mic is CRISP
my number 10 song of all time. I love kendrick on this song, sampha on this song even more, and that BEAT
🔥🔥🔥
Here after the Dissect ep
Mr. Morale is a truly masterful body of work. I was listening to it in the car while driving home, and the tears couldn't be stopped. Mother I Sober is my favorite song from the album. And possibly my favorite Kendrick song. The collab with Beth Gibbons was stellar. Kendrick's genius is a once ever-so-often experience.  I hope more people can appreciate everything he's given us. Music is art people, and what said art means to you, no one can take away.
2:16
Top 5 Kendrick song to me.
Well I’m glad this happened,because now that the tangerine nightmare has appointed himself over the Kennedy Center you can rest assured he won’t invite Kendrick 😂
i have to admit i remember listening to Mr Morale the first time when it dropped and i didn’t understand the tone  3 years later and ive gone thru some things and found some maturity to where i revisited this album and i see the entire thing as a piece of art. it’s an album i definitely would wanna play around my kids one day when they get older and start to find out how the world is
Gloria
I love that first "whew" in crowd after they finish. You can tell that crowd member was feeling what KDot was saying
This song shows why this album is deserving of another pulitzer prize 😃
DID ANYONE NOTICED THE ROOM GETTING SMALLER?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?? WTFFFFFF
im so excited that I get to live through this.
The ass poppers didn't understand that masterpiece called Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers
This is and was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Go Mr. Lamar!!!
This was deep
Still my fave album ❤❤❤great song still makes me teary 😢 eyed this one and all of the stars 🌟
I be tryna to listen to this album but simply cannot get through it   😞🥲
Thanks for uploading. Its crazy how this performance is nowhere to be found. This is a classic for sure.
Honestly man, hot take but this is a top 3 kendrick album
That was so beautiful 😍🥲
k dot 🥺🥺💯🔥
Cream always will rise to the top.
I’m a Daughter Who Grew Up without My Dad Or Mom, But Hell I’m a Stand up Person I would Never Let My Daughters Feel The sense of Abandonment.
can anyone ID kendricks pants?
He should have stuck with K. Dot.
One my fave performance ❤❤❤❤
A classic moment. 💎
💯
The best god bless ❤❤
This is everything❤‍🔥
That set design is killer, the room getting smaller and smaller.
Had to pull up again for 2025. With over a million views, bro needs to find Red and break him off with some of the YouTube revenue!
Damn, im here after the Superbowl. Bro has always been consist AF about how he felt. Im a old school Gemini like Kendrick, dont know what the F Kanye was on.
Is that a jail cell?
RESPECT. 👑❤️♾️ Grown Men With aDaddy Issues.
Mr. Morale is perhaps Kendrick's magnum opus. One of the best albums I've ever heard, across any genre.
Y’all better open your eyes & look inside. That’s what Kanye is saying.
Sampha sounds like Giveon
Top 3 best Kendrick with Gloria and die hard, top 5 would add pride and all the stars
That hook is everything
This sounds amazing, like a draft version of the song recorded in studio
Crucifying the stage 💯🔥  Still my camp till 2025
Talented
Why is he so fine
Sampha sounds like Odog fused with the bitch from 101 dalmatians, (Love his voice though)
I love you ❤ ( all) I feel yah 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿😇
sampha murdered this song
Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped.... REAL 🔥🔥
This is flawless. Unbelievable.
Just amazing!😭🥰
Dam kdot smooth with his performance
This shit hard! Give me goosebumps
This the kind of music that saves lives.
Coming back to this
Mr Moral is a masterpiece
i love this song so much ❤‍🔥
Kendrick makes unnatural movements sick and natural somehow
My Favorite from MMABB. . Always pushes my heart to tears.
just wow
❤️❤️❤️❤️
This brought me so much JOY!! Dick Van Dyke is a national treasure! Happy early birthday, Dick!🎉
❤
Rule again 😂🙏
sounds exactly like streaming
You entertaining old friends when they toxic 😮
Oh this gone be on the real album
Perfect soundtrack for my life
snl not good anymore but this and shane gillis special was there best moments from the last 4 years
This song is UNDERRATED
The fact the space got smaller just add to the creativity behind the artistry.
LITERALLY YELLED OUT LASTNIGHT “KENDRICK PLEASE DROP” WOKE UP TODAY & HERE WE ARE THANK YOU!
PGlang
How did Harry's House win AOTY over MMATBS
Drake really thought he would win a beef with this man? Drake's crazy
Yo ! Spoke With spirit 😮 Thanks ...🥀
my life is a plot twisted from directions I couldn't see
🐐
Let's give the women a break , grown men with daddy issues
a gifted silver tongue. his language is divine
Kendrick is the closest thing we will get to Tupac
🔥🔥🙏💎🙏
Father time,Mother I sober, Feel(DAMN) songs that i avoided but later find courage to listen...mahn sigh  "i got some healing to do"
Mannnn this 💩 speaks to your soul 😢
sampha killed it on this performance im not even gonna lie
I like Sampa's voice and Kendrick is just dope.
Kendrick goat, Sampha your voice is unique and beautiful
Beautiful ❤ love 🙏
Kendrick is one of the artists whose discography I'm very familiar with and who I like and admire a lot. Great talent! I just listened to his album from 2009, I don't recall what was the album's title, but what he was rapping about back then has come true and I'm happy and grateful that I'm having the pleasure to listen to him and witness him make history. He's definitely heard, just as he wanted.
It’s Saturday night and we out here censoring art to comfort old folks
“And to my partna’s who figured it out without a father, I salute you..”   I salute you too Kendrick!
Yes sampha 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Kdot❤
Sampha que lindo, encanta a alma.
Well damn.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Should do this at Super Bowl got tears in my eyes!
Sampha looks like a Key and Peele character lol
DOT STANDING OVER THE GAME 🔥
after listening to the the entire of mmatbs i feel like it really is just the good kid grown up
Oh my gosh you go deep your majesty King Kendrick Lamar 😢
This MAN IS MAGICAL!!!! King 🤴🏾 Kendrick!!!🤎
To all the hood babies, therapy don’t make you less of a person, break that generational curse 💪🏽
This song is one my top Kendrick even though most consider this album as low tier
Sampha's voice is just remarkable
you can say i'm riding, but this mf is really HIM, isn't he?
goat
My fav song. This was needed, songs like this have you doing self inventory checks. My ambition was always be everything good in life and be everything to my kids my Father never was for me. I met my Dad at 25yrs old he showed no love, that next year I turned 26yrs old he went to prison and caught a 18 yr sentence. He wrote me from prison apologizing, It took me 6yrs from the time of that letter to forgive him, thats From 26 to 32yrs old. It took me 6yrs but I finally chose to forgive him cuz my mom said "life was hard on him he wasn't always that way but he was a great man, not perfect but good" and said she "love him no matter what and God requires us to love those that seem to be unlovable"...some of the last words I recall from her, my mom passed in a traumatic way before my eyes and I had to learn she's at peace now from sickness and I've learned to be at peace and cured from bitterness and rage against my Father while I'm living.  Moral of the story: if u got daddy issues, mama issues or any issues dont allow it to suffocate your life. You are not your circumstances and your past does not define what you can choose to be in the future. It only makes u better and stronger. God bless 🙏🏿❤️
Diss Bella the wolf
Mr Pulitzer! 💪🏽 🫡
sampha voice is so good tho lowkey
Song is such a classic but Kendrick doesn’t even remember the lyrics. Conveys how good the dexterity of his discography is to not even remember such a classic.
sampha verse adds a fkn good vibe to this beautiful song
This song makes me so emotional because I somewhat have daddy issues & my mom actually passed away some time ago & it just hit home for me I never knew my biological father but I grew up with a step father but he didn’t really teach me How to be a man I just had to learn from life & my own experiences so when I heard his song it hit me really hard & I cry every time
“Daddy issues kept me competitive, that’s a fact”
👑🐐👑
Father time really sweets well
Come one man .. this dudes music has substance !!   Drake no le llega ni a los tobillos
Amazing what you can do in a small space when you're creative
Samosa always shows up.
grown man.
La peor performance de Kendrick sin dudas.
Kendrick is the best. Ever
love the symbolism with the walls closing in, such a visionary ( drake could never make a song like this btw )
You really need some therapy Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin' about? Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck Shit, everybody stupid Yeah, well, you need to talk to someone Reach out to Eckhart I come from a generation of home invasions and I got daddy issues, that's on me Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see Daddy issues run across my head, told me, "Fuck a foul" I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house I stayed outside, laughin' with my friends, they don't know my life Daddy issues made me learn losses, I don't take those well Mama said, "That boy is exhausted, " he said, "Go fuck yourself If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch You could be a bitch or step out the margin", I got up quick I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues Early mornin' wake ups (ah) practicin' on day-offs (ah) Tough love (ah), bottled up, no chaser (ah) Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chaser (ah) Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chase Early mornin' wake ups (ah), practicin' on day-offs (ah, day-offs) Tough love (ah), bottled up, no chaser (ah) Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chaser (ah) Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chaser I got daddy issues, that's on me Lookin' for, "I love you, " rarely empathizin' for my relief A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee 'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself Man should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped His mama died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon? His first reply was, "Son, that's life, and bills got no silver spoon" Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your mama'n'em This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific (ah) Need assistance with the way I was brought up (ah, ah) What's the difference when your heart is made of stone And your mind is made of gold And your tongue is made of sword, but it may weaken your soul? My niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensatin' Learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' gangsta I love my father for tellin' me to take off the gloves 'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was And to my partners that figured it out without a father I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes 'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues Early mornin' wake ups (ah), practicin' on day-offs (ah) Tough love (ah), bottled up, no chaser (ah) Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chaser (ah) Neat, no chaser (ah), neat, no chaser
I love this song . Resonates deeply. ❤
Greatest of all time
That last verse is so insane the vulnerability Kendrick has displayed for over a decade is beautiful and once in a lifetime talent
How earth do you people compare Drake to him
Whoever said the Mr. Morale album was trash is crazy. That album is so deep that I can't listen to it straight through without weeping. It's a masterpiece like all of Kendrick's works.
Years, years ago. I had to apologize to my father for hating him. He was hard on me just like in this song. He told me "I knew i wasn't the best father, but you turned out alright". We reconciled and the burden on me was lifted. I no longer carried the anger toward him or any authority figure. I went from planning on doing something terrible to him (that would have put me in prison), to being the best man in his wedding after some years. Nothing special about me. God allowed the generational curse to be broken, because my family had a history of the men hating the father's and we made that everyone's else problem that we encountered. Please, believe you can be healed 🙏
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🖤🖤🖤💎💎💎🎂😘😘
Just Kendrick making something great again. Not surprised of his surprising us
An unexpected error occurred.
I AM Father Time.
kendrick hits different after the beef man, searching for music with actual substance.  that drake music is the same thing everytime, gets more immature by the day. its sad.
it's all about sampha really
Sampha 😊 love the way he sounds
That's the slime shady he's referencing tho it's comic rap on his end with easy reference/targets
i thought i was crazy but yes the room got smaller 😂
какой он великий
The walls closing in .. ART
Should’ve left this Man ALONE 😅
Grown folk music 🎶 the soundtrack for maturity
He is HEEEEEEEERRRREE!!!! Our next Malcom X next Tupac next Michael Jackson/Prince. THANK YOU KENDRICK LAMAR FIR BEING KENDRICK LAMAR!!!!!
Sampha didn't really fit well on this song in my opinion. I usually love the people featured on Kendricks albums, but this hook didn't do it for me
For a live recording, this sounds like studio recording quality, the talent is crazy, other rappers screaming over backtracks, Kendrick the one
SO KEN & FRIENDS ON JUNETEENTH, NOW THE MUSIC VIDEO ON INDEPENDENCE DAY?! Damn.
Damn. “Jumped up when I scrapped my knee”
Looks lijj oh e an 80s house
The owl in the cage reference is crazy
This the part where mental stability meets talent. Oh this the part where he breaks my humility just for practice. Tactics we learn together. Sore losers forever. Daddy issues.
A perfect artist that dont need auto tune, drake u bum
I had to ask myself who is better than Kendrick Lamar?… he did this with no backtrack for his vocals. Hes number 1
Wow… that was flawless
#teamdrake
This album changed my life
Art is timeless.
❤️This song is amazing, this performance is outstanding but this straight up gave me mega claustrophobia💀💀😭😭
i used to call this "mid morale and the mid steppers" and in retrospect i was wrong asf. this album took incredibly long for me to get used to though.
💯🌺👑🔥 K GLOBAL ORIGINAL OWNER 🧡🤠
I hate people that say this album was mid
Who’s here on Father’s Day ?😂
"KNOW NUTHIN BOUT THAATT"
2:14 wth the walls closing in 😮
Greatest of all time
this song is so underrated, this song alters with my brain, positively ❤️
You see the mistakes, till then, let's give the women a break...  Grown men, with Daddy issues...   Acknowledging the message of this song truly marked a turning point in my life and changed 😮i8my perception of life itself.... Shead light on some demons I never considered the existence of.
Grown Men with daddy issues
Bruh he dropped "Rigamortis" in 2011, anyone coming after him since that was on a suicide mission for real...
❤❤❤❤❤
Lord Sampha's voice is AMAZING!!
once again? slap him.
Song speaks volumes to the real ones out there that got stripes
And that ladies and gentlemen, is the greatest rapper who ever lived
Real shit
When kanye got back with drake 😂😂😂
Kendrick let me
Good performance.
i almost forgot to watch this today
This song right here man. If you had a tough father/grandfather/uncle that you lived with and they aren’t here anymore, this will put a tear or two
Warned you that he was not mature enough for all that BS, yet you still tried him. Oh Aubrey 😔
a powerful performance in every aspect
Smash the like button if you’re now seeing the pgLAng on his cap.Genius
At what point do you look at this guy and go, "you know what, i can battle him"?!
Only people who are raised in a single family get these different...Healing song
People rejectes this album becuase they did not wanted to hear music that will make comfront personal demons after Covid they wanted to be distracted rather than thinking which is perfectly fine but sometimes you have to open up yourself  for different  expiriences
woww Sampha got a heavenly voice
It sounds almost the same as in the track, but even harder when you see the performance
i don’t know who that yapper in the hat is, and whatever he is saying, however “meaningful” it is, is NOT music; but the singer that did the chorus did a decent job.
EVERY performance by Kendrick is special, seriously solidifies his greatness with everything he does
Not kendrick dancing on most thug song bout having issues coz of upbringing.
When you're Kendrick Lamar but your mom says you have to give your weird cousin a turn on the mic.
I love you guys❤
The way he dances is so satisfying lol
I wonder what that dance hes doing is. He doing alot of the same movements
He is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool.
Drake could never
Sleeper Classic. 🔥. Gotta listen to the whole album properly. I slept on this
Its incredible how meticulously crafted this man is. Jaw dropping. oh and he hates Drake.
🔥🤍
This is just beautiful
Fathers and Mothers stay together and make the next generation better
He was dissing drake in this too 😂😂
"DADDY ISSUES BUMP EVERYBODY, GO GET YOUR MONEY SON, PROTECT YOURSELF, TRUST NOBODY ONLY YOUR MOMMA AND EM, THIS MADE RELATIONSHIPS SEEM CLOUDY NEVER ATTACHED TO NONE, SO IF YOU TOOK SOME LIKINGS AROUND ME I MIGHT REJECT THE LOVE." 🤧
The stage plays such a big part in this performance and adds such depth to the experience. So good.
This link up was way overdue....sampha is generational too
People in the future are going to discover this album and appreciate way more than we do right now after we're all gone.
He sounds exactly like the record, impressive
I love Kendrick as an artist. Super proud of him
저 모자 사고 싶다 😶
🐐🐐
Thank you 👑 Kendrick
drake put us back here
Nice
🔥🔥🔥
I LEARNT ENTRAPMENT IN THE BUSINESS
Bro I damn near cried
I'm here on a victory lap boys
this was the greatest snl performance of all time and nothing will ever come close
Why do I get goosebumps listening to this
The way he censored this track is crazyyy  keep teaching Aubrey some manners Dot.
Who's here in May 2024? This performance and song are brilliant. The movements — pure artistry.
When Kanye got back with Drake i was slightly confused - Kendrick  And now we are here singing 'OV HOOOE' 🔥
Mr. Morale will age like fine wine. Give it a few years. Itll sweeten. Trust me. Its ahead of its time. Its going to take some time to digest.
Who’s back here in 2024 knowing Kendrick beat Drake
4:51 am I had to hear this
Pure gold!
Dot is one of the greatest story tellers in music history
This song is so POWERFUL
K L🐐🔥
Literally beautiful.
Bro kendrick lamar Is winning nd drake took a lose when his security got shot
GOAT
life is bi
Omg 2 of my favorites!
Drake should listen to this song
If I ever catch flight it’s going to be direct

This album opened me up to therapy.. Saved my relationship and possibly, life.
The beef brought me back here...
Good Music best onel
Rest In Piss Drake Epstein ⚰⚰⚰
Drake performed with Sampha first on live television just saying lol just saying Kendrick is following the format -
Kendricks vibe got killed, now hes on that "demontime" shit atm 😂 , ur a legend kendrick .
Kendrick can make you laugh, cry, love, no one can do it like him.
I got daddy issues..that’s on me.💔😔
“When kanye got back with drake I was lightly confused, guess I’m not mature as I think I got some healing to do”.
Drake killed X don't forget
This song hits me deep ngel
Incredible ❤
Sammphhaa uk stand up and kenny hard as per usual. No homo as you lot say.

You touch hearts❤
Tf is Kendrick doing with his left arm? 😂😂
“Aww! I hope them sentiments symbolic.”
This song is incredible
So what's that dance Kendrick?.... Looks like a new style 🤖 Robot... You gon be ahiight tho.
Yeah, people who thought this album was “mid” just didn’t get it mainly because they were looking for bangers. This album is an excellent deconstruction of Kendrick’s personal demons.
"I love my father for telling me to take off the gloves. Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was" that line never fails to fuck me up, man.
“When your heart is made of stone and your mind is made of gold and your tongue is made of sword but it may weaken your soul” - The imperfection shows he’s human and I love it!
🐐
Sampha
Sampha this Wednesday!! Boise
Heart this if you listen to this song and cried alone because you got “daddy issues”!
I got daddy issues that’s on me
Honestly this is insane
Bruh i thought the vocals were prerecorded at the start his delivery is that clean
If you don't like this song, you got daddy issues
Art
the kanye and drake verse aged like drake's career
This song made me go apologize to my father for everything that made me have issues with him.
I buried my Stepfather last year,  every time I listen to this song tears run down on my face as I think about his commitment to raise a adopted son.  I am grateful for his love even though most times I regarded his actions as expression of hate, I realise now that his tough love prepared me for toughest situations. I don't know where my real father is and I'm not concerned.  Father's day is the worst day to me and today I walked around the campus and saw the graduation ceremony, people hugging their fathers, something that has become extinct in my life.  I hope angels are hugging him up there on my behalf ❤
!!! Hi KENDRICK !!!!!!
❤❤
✨️✨️✨️Esperando verlos cantar juntos en el AXE Ceremonia 2024 ✨️✨️✨️✨️
🔥🙏🔥
sampha's vocals omg...
❤️‍🔥
My mom was who expressed this to me ❤❤❤
one of my favorite songs on the album. hits different when you listen to this honestly it makes alot of sense why kendrick took like 5 years to make this. dudes been going through something and we gotta be grateful we even get some kendrick.  this album is amazing 9/10 for me honestly and shit hits different when its something that could happen in your life.
Transformative
Beautiful performance by both, but music CANNOT be censored.
Man the chorus by Sampha is something else It also goes great with Kendrick's voice
Man what  a privilege to listen
The room turned into a prison cell because of daddy issues 👏🏾👏🏾art 🙌🏾
It’s debatably one of both Sampha and Kendricks best songs imo masterpiece from the greatest rapper of all time
👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿😭😭😭😭😭👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lost my father on 12/2/23.... this joint hits even harder now. Phuck 😢

A great very natural sounding performance with no auto sounds fantastic!!

Why do we have Kendrick moving like an automatron from FNAF? No wonder he doesn't do tours like that.

❤❤❤❤
Thanks Kendrick and Sampha...Your Poetic genius and Samphas beautiful voice help me deal with daddy issue more than any therapy session...  I wish all that have those daddy/mommy  issues listen. It is not Our fault...❤❤
💙🙏
I miss her
song made me legit tear up the first time, still a powerful song
this voice here its golden
GOFLY GODLY GODLY HEAVEN SENT
Do you got a middle gap too???
YESSSSS BEST VIDEO EVERRRRR
FUCK YESSSSS
goon
First time seeing Sampha ... Mans hot a unique vibe..  voice matches the man
The Mood Changed up so Fast
This song has really recently become the song I can't imagine loving more. It's so gorgeous. I am 1000% in love with it
GOAT DNA
Jesus Christ
Sampha is healing
Bro... He's mic presence is so good. No lie. Every word is being pronounced. Not only with cadence but also emphasis... Even delay😅.. Great
This man is an absolute legend.
I LOVE SAMPHA SM
Sampha voice next level
Daddy issues made me learn Ls I can take those well
incredible
Man this song gets me every time. Hard to hear it and not tear up a bit.
NiCe.
Saw Sampha riding the Northern Line a week after this album dropped. Looked like he was with who I assume is his daughter, and his sister? Or girlfriend? It was hard to tell. He saw me clock him, and I could see he had this kind of vibe of like "ah, I hope I don't get recognised on here" lol. I let it go, but it was crazy to see this guy riding the tube like a normal person, knowing that he'd just collaborated with KDot.
Masterpiece
stolen Blood Orange
I didn't think I'd be one of them. I've identified a lot of my issues. I'm trying to correct shit. Become a better man than the father I never had. But this song made me realize I got unresolved issues. Anger that stems from never having him around. The empty promises. The phone calls from another country. More lies. I only had my mom. And I think it's why I got immense respect for women. But without a father, a kid, especially a boy, lacks the other half. The half that he is. How am I supposed to be a man? Too many questions. And luckily I think I figured most of it out on my own or with my mom. Rest in peace, mamá. 2 years and it don't seem like it. The world moved on but I didn't. I never will.
Brooooooo😮❤
Just Dope!🔥
Obrigado Kendrick🙏🏻
Song made me cry it’s beautiful
🐐
This masterpiece in someway became a major contributor to my enlightenment,when ever I feel down and all I can count on this tune ❤❤❤
I got here from sampha page and I just heard of him today.... Dafuqs up with his marketing team?
Am I naive to be annoyed Kendrick censors this so ably?
Kendrick is theeeee GOAT
🔥
❤❤❤😢
I listened to this when I got out the Matrix. :)
I don't know if this video won any awards or not but it's a visual masterpiece.
One of my favorite tracks on the album❤
Impressive to sound just as good live
This track though 😢❤
Lousy song. Sad that songs simply must contain fuck, shit, piss & damn or no relevance will be exacted.  Gotta say nigga, honkey, kraka, and endorse killing a cop to be taken seriously.  Sad
I love it! It went from looking like a bedroom to a cell. So much depth to his music and artistry.
Real
Sorry but this some made me cry! 😕
I’m obsessed with this song and the rest of the album, man doesn’t miss.
PG Lang cap fyerr🔥🔥🔥 details in this video🔥
My father told me to be a better man So how could I be mad at him for being lesser than That was part of the lesson plan I pray I pay it forward So I can only look to the future...
I love you Kenny 🤍
This song gets me emotinal 😢
sampha one of the best feature artist ever
Sampha is underrated af, Kendrick and Sampha is such a good duo
"Until then let's give women a break, grown men with daddy issues" Amen too many messages in mainstream hip pop are about getting women, chasing women, not loving women, not trusting women, need a women's touch. Nothing about being a good man. Gotta give them a break, heal mature and come better. No need to push the cycle for short term release and life long hardship.
Keep it real
It sound exactly like the album recording
GOAT
🕺👑💭 💪❤️‍🔥🍷  ⛷️25💫
Dang the room made me claustrophobic
Wow, what a performance. That was beautiful
Them diamonds in his ears dancing like a mug
Wow
Together and individually, these guys are incredibly special artists
Said it on the other feature, and I'll say it again here. We're going to need an instrumentals B-side to this album.🔥
My love for miles teller
looking for I love you
The High Power Speaks Through Him
How does this video have only 1.1M views??😭
just a damn perfect song
So relatable man, tear’s in my eye’s newer to his music but damn this shit hits home.
Lezzzzzgo! the highest form of artist right here!
That why me like Kendrick
My thoughts on the censorship are none different than others. The swears and uses of sensitive topics add to the story of the song and sometimes stand by themselves.
Sampha voice 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
this sounds exactly like the studio verison
А чё са... перевода-ми? А чё са... перевода-ми?
Great artist! Keep up the good work. Don't stop.
They really censored "tongue is made of sword?" are you serious?
After watching Bruiser film this hits even harder
Good to see Sampha back in the present again. Hope he has some new music coming
Iconic 😭😭
He is just so good
틀어놓고 딴짓하다가 마지막 박수소리 듣고 ‘헐 ㅅㅂ 이거 라이브였지?’ 이 생각 듦
❤️
Bills dont have a silver spoon
doesnt even sound live, sounds like a pure mastered studio version.
Holy fuck with the lighting bro the room was shrinking at one point
Sampha... We need new music
Appreciate your presence
We definitely going to the top one day🎵🙏🏽🙇‍♂️
ICONIC
questa canzone era su fortniate
quem veio pelo jogandofoddaci???
This song talks to my soul
Sampha isn't that great live
This video is such a classic, the room gets smaller and smaller when he narrates his story.
Amo ele
Amo
Drake had to fake his LIVE SNL performance lol I can’t believe people actually think he’s in the same convo as Kenny.
Thank you for keeping me going Kendrick ♥️ I hope I get to meet you in the 3D would be a dream come true.
🎙️✨💎
this song is awesome and touching.
Blood on me
Kendricks Outfit is so nice
"This made relationships seem cloud, never attached to none. So if you take some liking to me, I might reject the love" I wish I could've articulated this a couple of years ago. because its a difficult place to be in and not realize
Is it supposed to look like slow motion?
flipping love this
just a masterpiece!
you are the f goat.
Sampha salone brbr!!! We proud bro
That K Dot dance 🙌🏾
I listened to Sampha first time with Drake but this song made me wanna listen to his album "Process", and it's simple amazing. Sampha is a real singer.
Artistic even in live performances. Artist.
Neat, no chaser
dude , that chorus
I love the visual of the walls slowly closing in on them throughout the song, true symbolism without needing to be stated
Mr Morale and the big Steppers was not only the best album in 2022 but it was the best rap album to have ever been produced, not only did he speak about real life issues he told us his story and I am extremely happy to have listened to it. Kendrick thank you so much for being consistent and beautiful in your work as a fan I am proud and you definitely are the greatest rapper of this generation! I know you might not see these but I love you and your music!
Only knock on this song is needs more Sampha, what a hook 🔥
album of the year  Performance of the year
1:35
Saw him in Dallas back in July, life changing
Does anyone know what hairstyle Kendrick might have under that hat?
Why he moving like that tho lol
this is so fucking good
we need visuals for this song
You're Too much in you world nigaa , please create music to help peoples
Sampha mustache is fire broo 🔥🔥🔥
I got daddy’s issues; only my mama knows!
“When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused. Guess I’m not as mature as I think, got some healing to do.” This bar hit me because black men always see beef/competition as strength which further damages the community and puts us through a repetitive cycle. Instead, we should be coming together and practicing forgiveness to overcome our circumstances.
Sampha went crazy on this
He sounds SO GOOD LIVE
Poet!
Samphas moustache
Hope we get a music video for this song and mirror
most relatable sone fr
Such a great song and performance.
Wow Sampha’s singing is literally the same as the original audio.
Waiting for its music video
Favorite song on the album
honestly one of his best songs ever, this album is a classic and will grow on people with time exactly how tpab did
ugh
I got just one question  When will I rap like Kendrick Lamar? ❤️❤️
Every time.
Simplicity is genius. Simplicity w originality is another level. This dudes a walking legend
0.0 talent need to shut down this hack
Beautiful performance 😭
F%$# that was beyond great!!! Raw power, talent, hitting verses and raw nerves. I'm in tears with my fist in the air. God this life is beautiful, thank you Kings! Feeling blessed to be a witness to True Greatness 🙌 ❤️‍🔥🙌
This is better than the studio version
Instrumental reminds me of "Memories" by Big Sean
sampha will always kill a feature, straight up fire
One of the best melodic rap music ever...my best in the album
I feel like if this is his art ..and y'all want him to preform then he shouldn't have to block out the original lyrics of the song.    Fuc this shhhhiitt I wanna here the explicit version tha way it was ment to be
The significance of a blue la hat. ✊🏾
🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Te amo Kendrick
Kendrick rap is so visceral, so metaphorical...it's as if he's speaking directly into one's soul and daring us; if to say,  go deeper and see the bigger picture around you.
that hat is fire brooo
Is it harder to expect the fact or harder to listen to it?
That's life, bills, got no silver spoon.... Ain't that the mufuckin truth
This track will make the taboo of men in therapy Irrevereant and thank god because we need it badly. And as masculinity is forevermore under siege in this moderen era im elated to hear music like this.
SAMPHAAAAA <3 such an ethereal voice!
We gon be alright
🫶🏽
Sampha’s voice is so unique and mellow. I love his music
G.O.A.T!!!!
Lost my dad last year and this song brought all my grief to the surface when I first heard it on the album. Kenny the GOAT
What a clean version 🔥
2nd favorite song from the album and that hat is fuckin clean 👏
💣🙏 what is rap without Kendrick Lamar?
A average person wouldn’t understand the deeper meanings of what we just watched. This man is a GENIUS
You know an artist is a all time great is when his live stage performance paints the picture of his lyrics and flow it’s just moves you
“You could be a b**ch and step off the margin,  I got up quick!! “”. I felt that bro
Father Time x Lebron James 🙏💜💛
“I just got something in my eye” 😢💜
kendricks movements are just mesmerizing
I had these feelings but never had time or thought to express it.. this song helps out a lot and shows me the truth.. my father came back in my life when I hit 30.. i'm 31 now and I still cant really accept how to accept him. He tells me if i need anything i can ask for it but im already in my prime from all the trails i dealt with.
When you have Sampha on a Track you know it’s a hit
My favourite on the album!!!!!!!
J'aime cette mélodie elle ne me fait pas mal à l'oreille
I Love You Throughout The Universe And Back*******INCOGNITO😢🫣🤎🙏🏽🤎🤎🙏🏽💯!!!!!!!

Anyone else getting IFHY vibes from the visuals?
Where can I get his hoodie?
God I love Sampha so much this performance was amazing the walls closing in were crazy!
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
He’s an amazing lyricist. His songs have so much meaning and emotion. And only a portion of us could even comprehend what he raps about. Kendrick Lamar is a legend in my book.
That pgLAng haha is haaaard
Beautiful!
That one lyric about Drake and Kanye didn’t age well
Im promise im not being a hater when i say this bc ive liked Kendrick's music since GKMC but...  He mixed tongue and heart in the second verse.  Still love this song so much and enjoyed him and Sampha's performance.
The way the walls cave in is the best detail to express what it was like as that child in a room building up pressure and often times, we never realize how big the room actually was until growing up and moving out, that is when we realized what we survived and what conditions we lived in.   My Heart. Thumb up if you woke!
Anyone knows what hoodie he's wearing?
This is a great song
Whats up with the the dance? Does it symbolize something? Or he just dancing?
✨🌿✨
Sampha is the fuckin man!!
EU TE AMO!!
What an ARTIST.
I honestly wish it was the guy singin on the song   I literally can’t stand Kendrick voice   Remind me of Q-tip
🐐
😍😍😍😍great visual.
Like watching Francis Farmer on "its your life." #Humbling.
This is some deep visuals frfr, the emotions and vurnerability to craft a set, and describe it what sounds line therapy and venting, the walls closing in on him, and the anxiety of his trauma
My favorite rapper Kendrick Lamar  Respect bro JAC from Thailand 💽
Epic ishhhhhh
I see Love as Purple energy from the heart before it’s turned and split (through the “jam” in your veins), into red and blue; separate energetic qualities in the brain. Red and blue combined make Purple.  Mo’ Jam Presents in Seattle is a jam me and my partner run and we put bands of strangers on stage to make up songs on the spot like the jam in your basement with new friends. This jam emits an all inclusive Purple energy as if the groove that strangers are making up on the spot, a brand new song putting out instant love and trust, mimicks the energy from the groove in your heart.  I teach children drums to ensure their connection to their innate groove is expressed and expelled naturally and quick, using a color coded method. It gives children the opportunity to learn the coordination instantly by matching the colors and repeating each drum beat over and over again to make it a groove. The fact that their groove is so natural is because they have a groove that drives them inside and it is my life’s mission to teach them that. And to stay Purple
This is just beautiful, best live hip hop performer.
I’m very intrigued by his choice of body language and movement cos it’s entirely deliberate
I had no idea that the walls were actually closing in as they were performing.
Damn sampha also sounds exactly like the songs when performing live 🔥❤️
one of the best songs!!
Love u.
this song is so emotional and touching
Well Done 💯🥂
This man is art it self
The man is incredible. Samphas song is very unique. Thoroughly enjoy it
I've listened to this song on Spotify for about 200+ times not capping.... definitely among my Kendrick top 3 songs of all time
Anyone noticed Sampha is about to drop tears in the end of the show?
Shook when I saw the dude from whiplash
I can relate to this song on a deeper level 💯🙌🏾
So grateful for his musical poetry. 😊 Thank you Kendrick for the VIP hoodies!!! 🤟
PgLang hat goes hard
Cold
Great performance just wish he chose better substitutes for certain words
He said "once again, ..." kendrick Lamar (for the soul) reeeeemix')
Gratitude
all the SNL guest have more followers then the program itself.... must be a glitch=)
It blows my mind you can't say four letter words on tv after 11:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
Watching kendrick live was generally an amazing experience
2nd time Sampha on SNL giving an epic performance. Drake and Kenny are two of the greatest, but we really need to give Sampha his flowers. Mans voice could literally go any day and he’s still giving us gems.
“Grown men with daddy issues .”
We live in a Fatherless society now
man Sampha's voice is so soothing
I woud like o see  colab between KENDRICK and D SMOKE
JUST SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The lyrics and the delivery are genius,the concept is genius anyone against this hates hip hop.
This song can represent what great hip hop artist can produce,thank you for keeping hip hop alive.this is not about you it's for hip hop, represent.
He barely moved and I love it. Sometimes less is more
Thank you Kendrick. This album is helping me heal… my inner child feels so heard… ❤️🐐
This song, the energy it brings, it soothes my hurtful soul, kendrick always hitting the soul, gem of a man.
I mean...this is a legendary hip hop moment. Beautiful shit
最高！！！！
FATHER TIMEEEEEEEEEEE
Kendrick Lamar is a legend. I have a beat that I know he would kill. Check it out here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNL3wLdJ9Eg

Master piece 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
The 🐐 Sampha 🙌🏾 The 🐐 Kdot
PM topi
Masterpiece
Nice to see him wearing some baggies that's what men do f skinnys
SAMPHA HAS MY WHOLE HEART I LOVE THIS MAN
I need that fucking pg lang hat bruh
nice lip-synch
favorite kendrick song.
Definitely shed some tears to this
Un son comme on en fait plus.  FR
Kendrick es lo mejor que me paso en la vida.
Love  brother
Golden.
I love this so much, cannot stop coming back to this.
Every song is a god damn banger
That’s love bro ❤
woooow
cant get enough of Kendrick
🙏🏿🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
This song hit a spot I didn't even know I had, tears that I'm not even understanding. Such an underrated album in general
Sampha needs to be in SNL too
Tupac back.
GARBAGE MUSIC
Kendrick ma guy 🔥💯🔥🔥
Kendrick always delivers a performance. True artist.
holy was this good
❤❤❤❤❤
Oloff is the greatest living artist
ǝɟᴉl ʎɯ pǝƃuɐɥɔ ɟɟolO ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Oloff changed my life
I listen to Doing It Stealthy when I'm experiencing existential dread. It makes it worse but... I just can't stop.

Doing It Stealthy helps me to process my feelings about 9/11.
Rumour has it one time Oloff was sat next to Jar Jar Binks on a flight. Jar Jar kept kicking the chair in front of him and generally being obnoxious, nobody knew what to do. Eventually one of the flight attendants came over and asked Oloff if he would perform one of his songs to calm Jar Jar down, and when Oloff began rapping the first verse to Doing It Stealthy, Jar Jar immediately relaxed. To this day the two are still close friends.
The GOAT. TDE x pgLang.
I love this song and the entire album
🔥 💗
One of the best songs from Kendrick ... hope Sampha gets more recognition, I mean his project with SBRKT was of the hook! Awesome talent!
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Muito foda
Sampha’s voice is so beautiful
😭😭😭🤐👌
Samphas voice is incredible, and Kendrick is the Goat
I love seeing Sampha just exist
Pre-recorded 😭😭😭
After sitting on it , it's crazy that as Kendrick was opening up about his issues, the smaller the room got. Almost claustrophobic as he throws out more
Kenny states that he says what he wants in the context of cancel culture in one of the songs and then bleeps every occurence of strong language. i don't get how this goes together. serious question coz i would like to know what people here think. is it problematic to use words like b* or n* in rap?
its always funny to me the sounds they make instead of the censored words, like ugh or something its so unfitting lol
sampha's voice is so damn beautiful
Sampha has a beautiful voice.
I love Kendrick ❤
kendrick's dace moves were on a loop
Handsome sampha 😍
Realizing this is the first time I’ve ever seen sampha
That was a really interesting decision on Kendrick's part to "censor" a ton of safe words and change some phrasings towards the end.
Kendrick is one of the Last real lyricists. You can watch my New music video here : https://youtu.be/UZVRNeE3pU0 a french drill song about putin biden and world war 3
So happy to see sampha getting airtime!! Long time fan  of his. He is criminaly underplayed
Sampha always delivers
Grown men with daddy issues - wow this song hits harder with every listen
Incredible!
My favorite song I cried the first time I listened to it
This that divine concoction of creativity , experience, and inspiration . This the highest art form.
Kendrick lamar always delivers the cold truth in the most honest unfiltered way. His body of work will always speak for itself. 🥰
Imagine him doin we cry together on snl lol
Just now seeing this
Insane
Geeeez
Wow
Everytime I hear this song. I wanna call my dad and thank him. Despite the harsh lessons and lectures he gave me that some may deem wrong. It toughed me up for the real world. We all got daddy issues but I'm grateful I had one and didn't have to figure out being a man on my own.
This set design is super fire 🔥
The greatest rapper of all time
I need that cap but it’s rare af
Kendrick is a goat thank you for this 🔥
Kendrick ♥️♥️😭😭
He is one of the most influential rappers I have ever seen from him. He's on the right level along with J. Cole, Nas, Jay-Z and lots of rappers that he grew up listening to.
Kendrick, Sampha, you sound AMAZING together. Please collab again in the future.
Definition of in the zone
Sampha's piano is just so easy to recognize. What a talent
thanks SNL
Greatest talent of our generation watching from Uganda🔥
Kendrick really got Sampha to come out of hiding
This my shit. I sing the hook
It is impossible to have daddy issues and not cry listening to this song man. K u the goat 4L
Sampha’s contribution is wonderful…
Conscious Rap
Ah this makes me want to review the album all over again!! Loved when this album dropped! It was iconic! A sensational piece of work! One we needed! What a time!   If you haven’t seen my review you can view here: https://youtu.be/GRxBiX3lnrQ
That was incredible
OMG this is amazing 😍🤩
Kendrick is an open book when it comes to his music. Nothing is sugar coated, or skipped over. He never has strayed away from talking about his grief, guilt, regrets, hardships, mistakes, triumphs, and everything else in between. He doesn’t talk about it unless he’s lived it. One day there is going to be a movie made about Kendrick’s life and I can’t imagine a world where it wouldn’t win huge awards. He has enough experiences in his life to have lived several lives. He is wise beyond his years. Thank God he decided to pursue music from a young age. Sharing a window into your life through your music thus far has truly been a treat, thank you Kendrick ❤️
🐐🐐
Best song of the album
🙏
Whose hand is it?! Spoil the work! Wtf Why u just crop or edited it out😑
Everyone rightfully giving Kendrick his props, but Sampha fucking CRUSHED this hook.
What is the definition of overcrowding?  When there is that much talent in a ~ 2m X 2m room.  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great performance 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
HE BROUGHT SAMPHA? NO FUCKING WAY
this is top 10 best Kendrick Lamar songs of all time it might be top 5 too
La mejor canción del album
Love these live performances
Y'all saying album of the year are wrong....   This is album of the decade, people aren't even ready yet.
This song has definitely made me cry as black man with my own kids. Too true.
❤️ 🙌
I choose you kendrick
This hits different, 👌 levels killing the music this a classic  kendrick
This song always gets me in tears
👑🖤💯
True Quality Performances From This Man. ❤️😔

I want that pgLang hat BAD
I love this, pure talent and creativity ❤️❤️🎧🎶💯
this song is bigger than music. great job, k dot.
This song is amazing I support everything Kendrick’s been doing and fr
I was wondering why Kendrick censored words like “stone”, “sword”, etc., and then I realized he messed up the lyrics but made it look completely seamless.  Somehow I find that even MORE impressive!
Top tier artist right there. Kendrick Lamar!!!!
Early morning wake ups 😊
Seeing Sampha on Tv is fucking cool
🔥
Bro it feels like such a long time since we seen Sampha live. Need more of him soon 🥺
Sampha can sang!!! 🔥🔥🔥 Shout out the best Kendrick.
Sheeesh
man i missed Sampha
YO I NEED THAT HAT
i'm so glad to see sampha alive fresh and clean ❤with same perfect vocals
Damn he really looks like Eazy-E right here
sampha gotta drop another album man
Sampha has lost weight
I dont listen to this man because of the fame  grown men with kendrick issues
Mr morale and the big steppers
Legend
butterflies!!!!
Wow these lyrics are POWERFULL!! Ugh we don’t deserve Kendrick 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾
This is probably my favorite performance I've ever seen on SNL.So good❤️
We deserve a music video
My father passed last November. But this song hits hard no chaser
Much love Kendrick ❤️❤️❤️
Sampha is so fucking underrated!!!
This sounds like the album version..wow
Excellent song when you get a chance to see and process the lyrical content for understanding1!! Kendrick is My ❤.
Greatest rapper of our generation
Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. I grew up with no Father and I have been blessed with the privilege of raising a son. Beautiful.
Am so happy this has been a big year for one of my favorites ever.... Mad respect for King K
the best ablum so far in 2022
Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, and Ye are the best to ever do it. We are so lucky to have them in our lives. Thank you.
this heartfelt my brother.
Sorry but Sampha can’t hit the note on live performance. I heard him live 5 years ago and nothing has changed.
kendrick got insane moves as well
how sick is his hat tho..
k. the greatest and best of all time.
So sick of this goddamn lip syncing
Not enough persons mentioning how Sampah bodied this 😮‍💨
SAMPHA
ROOSTER 🐓 FROM TOP GUN INTRODUCING KUNG FU KENNY ON SNL ?  GOOSE WOULD BE PROUD 😇
How can the song on spotify and LIVE be the same? perfect..
Samphhaaaaa
he killed it again
GORGEOUS ❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🦋 what an incredible song and performance 🌹🌹🌹
Love seeing Sampha dude is mad underrated this track goes hard
did anyone else notice his hat 'pgLAng' thats actually wild..
La verdad es una de las canciones mas hermosas y dolorosas que e escuchado en mi vida, esto hace grande a kendrick y hace que deje huellas en la gente además de que esta canción me llega en el momento en que soy padre primerizo y reafirma que el padre que yo necesite, yo lo soy ahora para mi hija
Peace 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Em kendrick vemos um artista completo
Favorite song off the album. Very relatable
Incredible song
So happy when I heard Sampha
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
DaaaMN! That JaWN tight son: AMAZING 💣💣💣
#nerdingishealth
best song of the album for me, simply beautiful
I ship Kendrick & Jhene
This song makes me cry, my dad is not present so my tears dry but this song still makes me cry
Kenny kept the same dance moves all these years😊
no crazy sets, lighting, or expensive production. just a flawless performance.
Who else wants that hat?! 🧢
need that pglang fitted.
That pg LA ng  hat is BRAZY, also this is one of kendricks best songs
It’s funny that Kendrick had to bleep him self on SNL
The hand at 3.12 is getting fired haha!
This song🥺🥺🥺🥺Thanks Lamar
just crazy caluculated execetion, honestly approaching near one of my favorite Kendrick songs
The best
Garbage 🗑🗑🗑
SAMPHA 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Sampha is the MF’n best to do it. If only bro got the same shine as TheWeeknd. It’s coming tho. In the background of drakes songs for too long!
K-Dot da🐐no🧢
best song on the album
I'm so crazily happy to watch Sampha live, you have no idea
Im living in his era
Second verse is seriously next level rhyming.
Great performance always but after we just gonna ignore the fact that whoever was moving the walls closer in together hand was showing in the left side of the shot? 😂😂 @ 3:08
I wonder why kendrick is doing those very particular movements when he performs. Like im actually curious of its symbolic or a meditative thing
Excelent performance!! Kendrick its an amazing artist!! and Sampha!! WE NEED MORE MUSIC FROM HIM!
Kenny’s cropped hoodie goes SO HARD
Que flow ao  vivo puta que pariuuu
beautiful
A real legend
Til then I give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues
caraaaaalho kendrick
this my fav mf song off the album. shit hits so deep.
beautiful, King Kenny never dissapoints & Sampha killed the hook
The Goat
Must be so annoying to do this performance and censor the art
dope
You need something underrated? Please, watch my 'GOOD KID - Kendrick Lamar' acoustic cover performance in here :  https://youtu.be/V8LnK4QARfI  Thank you so much!  #Brasil
Great performance!!!
Amazing
Damn this song hits hard. Much love
This song gives me goosebumps.
He didn't perform the end of his second verse when I saw him live. I wish I could've seen this performance live
@sampathegreat we waiting
Love!! ❤
Feminized hoodies are a thing now too?
Sensational!!!
Singing without saying the N word or any *** language is already a big performance
Some of the greatest of this generation
🖤🇧🇷🖤
One of the few men and artist who can make simplicity seem sophisticated. True creative genius. #Dot
Glad he doesn't wear the crown anymore, the symbolism in that one didn't quite sit right with me. Also did the cube they were in get smaller as they performed?
❤️
thanks for this kenny, love u <3
This is what a live performance sounds like when the artist is actually talented and perfected their chosen craft, DAMN!
They just committed homicide on SNL 🔥
Thank you for that
Its had to find the real voice and production voice be the same
👌
Entregou absolutamente tudo.
One of my favourite Kendrick songs
Kdot created Dad Rap
rare for someone to sound just like the album live
everytime
Love the hand @3:10 brilliantly put together performance 👏
I don't like his new album at all, I think it's easily his worst but this song is great and so was the performance. Sounds just like the record in fact.
GOAT Gentlemen
Legendary
This song is more than music, to see it performed with the walls closing in on them was so fire to me, amazing analogy  💎
Brilliant.
Therapy sessions with Kendrick 😌 + the voice of Sampha. this is art...
THAT’S WHY HE’S THE GOAT!!! THE GOAT!!!!!!!!
I’d say most black men in America have daddy issues 😐!
The pgLAng hat is too cold
I love Kendrick’s!!
BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
DID ANYONE SEE THE WALLS CLOSING IN!?  DID ANYONE SEE THE ROOM GET SMALLER!?  Wow. Great execution Kendrick.
sampha realy happy to be performing , coudn't help but ot smile in the ending of the performance. great artist, deserves more recognition <3
https://youtu.be/VhWMIwcGlbs Our idols of this earth will fade away  Seek Jesus Christ, the only crown thats still here 🙏🏽
Darn it! I thought I was the only person who could do the remix singing voice! 😂
King Lamar. 💪
✡️🕎🙏🙏💪👑💪
Universo 3
This song is soo REAL! Especially in this new generation alotta kids having Daddy issues.. and wonder why they have certain relationships with people. Kendrick explains it so well! 🔥🔥🔥 Classic track
So Inspirational man
Sampha really is an MVP. If Kendrick were a waffle, Sampha would be like the syrup and butter. He takes something already great and elevates it even more.
Love you king Kendrick
Love the shirt under the hoodie that’s how we grew up Chi LA NY
His music is very timeless man, hes setting the bar extremely high
“Lord keep him safe, as only our culture is left of us. Thank you for speaking truth through him. We need him Lord”. This I 🙏 pray, Amen. 🫡👊🏿🔥🔥🔥  SAMPHA 🔥🔥🔥👊🏿🫡 Let’s get it.
Dot a dançar hiphop. Damn🐐
🤞🏻
cant we just say the fuckin words. you go to museums and see nudity uncensored. but because its rap, people dont see it as art. for various reasons, the biggest one being racism
nobody gon talk about how we havent seen sampha doin any performance for a while and he suddenly comes back wit kendrick? THATS CRAZY TO ME, he is hella talented
Kendrick is an ARTIST. Others are sleeping
Love this song but I have to mention that hat. Fire idea
Meekness
sampha's voice is golden
Awesome bruh!
The Goat
Surprised sampha leaves home
Sampha ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This album is too great 😭

Kendrick Lamar king of rap👑👑💕
My favorite in the album😩❤... Kendrick knows how to get me

PINCHE ROLOOOOOON

The PG Lang hat is FIRE
❤❤❤❤❤
The walls are closing in on them
King kendrick
im so happy he got sampha on here
Tough 💪🔥🔥💯💯
The man works on his craft and delivers every time. 👏🏿
people not realizing how much of a blessing a sampha appearance is
This is great, just wish they didn’t have to censor it
That whole elaborate set, the performance energy, everything just top notch from Kenny.
Both of these guys got crazy talent that this being live on a stage that’s literally collapsing in on them and broadcast to millions sounds just as good if not better than it did in the studio. It’s unbelievable.
I fucking love that hat
I love you so much Kendrick, you don’t even understand….
I swear this man be motivating me on my musical journey so much I got a tape dropping on the fifth and I swear I take a bunch of inspiration from folks like Kendrick
No words can describe this generational talent. We run out of superlatives. He is the best rapper alive. Kendrick is a privilege to witness perform.
GOAT
Um dos maiores rappers dessa geração, kendrick você men, e um cara muito foda, sou seu fã cara, vem pro brasil pfvr nigga 🇧🇷🖤.
Can’t stop watching it serious 🥺🥺🥺
Masterpiece
Sampha come back pls
yall see the hand to the left at 3:12 😂😂😂

IM SEEING A 5TH GRADER DO ANAL TO A 1ST GRADER AT SCHOOL PLS HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats to ke drink for getting sampa out the house

Sampha went CRAZY! Great performance
I'm even more glad I went to his show! Father Time is one of my favorites!
Kendrick Lamar Forever  Kendrick Lamar 4 Life
I don’t have the words to describe how much Kendrick Lamar’s music means to me. So, that’s all I have to say.
Kendrick the GOAT
Andrew Tate - Top G or Insecure Psycho ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlI4Jagz6Co
KENDRICK LAMAR!!❤️💙 & SAMPHA!!❤️💙__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
👏 👏
Profound
GOA finish it
Kendrick really brought Sampha out of his cave
❤️🔥💐!
The fact that this man brought Sampha back on TV is an accomplishment
So glad sampha was performing too
Sounds like an album recording. Kendrick always has had dope breath control
🗣️🗣️🗣️
The Pg LAng hat is 🔥
Glad to finally see Sampha, man's a legend
God bless you Kdot, your uniqueness is out of this world.
I'm really happy to see Kendrick Lamar in these hats again
sounds exactly like the original
A billion 👍🏼
Art!
I wouldn't mind hearing another Kendrick and Sampha song💜💯
idk why but i thought sampha was white til i saw this lol
The amount of times as a woman that someone has jokingly made fun of me or another sister who was struggling with their relationship with men using that word 'daddy issues' - I appreciate Kendrick using it in the same way to talk more towards men struggling with the same thing because I know the trauma runs deep on that level for men as well. I pray we al l find healing. The instrumentation on this thing is beautiful.
Kendrick is awesome
his breath control is legendary
THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER!!
Masterful.
maybe a dumb white girl comment here: what does the "pg...ng" on KL's cap mean? 🤷‍♀
He’s such a star maaaan! Rapping it like that live! His voice and flow is always so amazing. He is one of the rare rappers that have such Star Power and stage presence by himself or with just a few people on stage
This was beautiful.  Sending healing vibes for Kendrick.
the walls "closing in" were hella dope
I love Sampha! His voice is so unique!! Kendrick Lamar killed it once again!
I want that hat so bad
Tears still come to my eye's when I hear this song. 😭❤
Necesito esa gorraaaaa
#Legend
We need a full video for this.
dying breed rapper in the pop world
The pg LA ng hat is fire
DO SAVIORRR PLSSSSS <3333
Father Time 😢.  My all time Favorite Lamar Song 💕 he speaks a lot about problems men face and the flow is just on poin😢❤
I love this song so so much it’s way deep🔥🩸
this is simply amazing
People who said this album was bad should consider becoming smarter
That's hat 🔥 tho!
Kendrick surpassed being a G.o.a.t  {Chanting} We want more 💯
Art
A musical genius of our time.
The one thing that bothers me the most about these live rap performances is the censorship. I totally get it but it's hard to overlook, it kills the performance's vibe while it could've been perfect.
Kendrick awkward movements remind me of Tyler’s.
🧢🔥
🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
PERFECT !!!!!
I need that Pg LAng hat
God, Kendrick didn't have to dig up my old wounds.
Glad to see Sampha still killing it!
Can’t wait to see Kendrick 7th of October 2022. Will be historic, of course blessing ❤
Te amoooo
Sampha and Kendrick 🐐
This and his performance on the Colbert Report from a decade ago are my favorite things
Makes me wanna cry 😢
🔥🔥🔥
When can we buy the pg lang hats???
Sampha's voice gave me chills. This song is beautiful. I can't help but wish he also did Savior. One of my favorites off the album.
🐐
🔥🔥
He really brought sampha back from obscurity
One of Kendrick’s best
Kendrick is L.A. to the core and I love it
lets not act like kendrick aint hit that at 2:55 lol
so simple and straightforward, dope
Sampa's voice is 💯
It takes a man
fire
I love you bro. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This song and "auntie diaries" are masterpieces
JUNE 17TH 1987 A SUN WAS BRUNG TO US
Sampha always have his hair like that or is that an homage to coolio?
I put my phone in my pocket and honestly forgot this was live
This guy deep how do come up with this shit
Kanye influence in that production
can kendrick tell sampha to drop
This collaboration is special because Sampha dreamed of it all the way back in 2017. Skip to a minute and 40 seconds in this interview!  https://youtu.be/FsK5Tl9NML4  The reporter:  “If don’t think you’ve already peaked with Beyoncé, who else is the dream to collaborate with?”  Sampha:   “I really like Kendrick Lamar, one day I’d just like to speak to him to be honest, we don’t even need to like write anything”  The power of manifestation 🙌
suddenly started crying while watching this
One of my favorite songs from Kendrick . Masterpiece 👏🏼!
Love this
Damn, Sampha's voice is really amazing
Hes not blending in because he's not the same and that takes guts he's too good
LEGENDARY PERFORMANCE!!
Anybody notice the wall closing in tighter and tighter..
This man started lookin like Eazy-E in some of these shots, legendary
man that guy looks like cleveland from the cleveland show 😅
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Legendary https://youtu.be/TuicMslyNs8
📡🇧🇿
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤
YES, Sampha!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goat
How they did the walls was dope
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
father time
🌍🌍🌍
Holy shit this sounds lip synced how insane is this for a live performance!?
Sampha's vocals just take this song to a whole different level.
loved seeing sampha perform
wow samphas live voice is amazing
This is the first song I’ve heard In my life that I can say actually helped me get through some shit. Kendrick 🐐
that pg lang is so clever
Such a sick way of doing staging, Kendrick and Sampha killed it 👏👏👏
This was fantastic. I would love Kendrick or anyone to speak on Kanye's 3 listening parties or his live performances, MJ inspired him but he inspires the likes of Kendrick and it shows here.
✌️🙏🏻📻🔥🧘‍♂️👁🕊🎤
His songs always hits my soul to where I cry 😢
I would LOVE for a visual to be made for this song.. this is POWERFUL.   As mental health becomes more and more important, men also need to break this cycle of internalizing everything. Expression doesn’t mean weakness. It actually means the opposite. Because as you heal from wounds, you grow stronger and you’re able to help others because you’re able to help yourself.
This song is way too deep to be just a song.
Love that Sampha was there!!!
Te amo Kendrick
Goated. Hands down. Top5 🫡
What's the meaning of the room shrinking? To me it seems as if this is to give the viewers perspective, as if as they grow up the room seems smaller, but I wonder if there's another meaning to this
Sounds exactly like the studio version that's when you know its talent
I need that fitted
FifteenK ish
It was sampa whole time 😮
K.Dot. GOAT....This one song on MMATBS is better than alot rappers albums this year
Kinda underwhelming performance from Kendrick. Nothing really happened here.  Edit: also why does he keep touching his stomach/hip area? That was weird.
One thing about Sampha, he may stay out of the spotlight for years, but once he emerges- it’s always worth while 😰🤍
Sampha really showed up! I feel like I rarely see him outside. Love this song. So vulnerable.
🔥🔥🔥
This is easily 1 if the best snl performances if all time!!!!!!! Cool set bro!!!
🚀🌙❤️
https://youtu.be/0f_IE38MCoA
Wow that was another insane performance by the king
Lookin' for, "I love you, " rarely empathizin' for my relief😒
Man this song always a repeat pure gold definitely one of the best
🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🐐
🇧🇷
It's been years since I see Sampha performs😭😭
I’m now a fan of Sampha hood looks kdot
favorite song from the album
Vocals are so clean
Sampha’s voice is angelic.
Kendrick the 🐐 but I'm so glad to see Sampha😭😭🔥🔥🔥🙏🏾
🥲 The Man is The Voice of our Times. I appreciate every word.💯
A true feminist!! Ended the patriarchy with 1 performance!!
sampha need to release an album again. he playing
I wasn't watching the video just listening to it and for a second I thought that Montell Jordan was singing the hook.
oh lord they done cloned kendrick
Just perfect
playback
He's so comfortable on stage
I think Mr Morale and the Big Steppers in time will be a sleeper classic. I know quite a few people who are Kendrick fans or huge hip hop fans weren't feeling the album much.. but the more you play it the more it grows on you
The greatest Alive no debate ever.
Now i truly understand what an artist is.
Holy shit that pg Lang hat goes hard
Hat fire
Good to see Sampha again!! Thanks Kenny y’all both gods!
これが一番好きだな
I need that hat
DAVE FREE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥💙
Kendrick is cold 🥶 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love you Kendrick. Always will
This is a top 10 Kendrick song
bro he look juss like top
Wow classic
FEW THINGS LIKE THIS MAKE ME PROUD TO BE BORN INTO THIS GENERATION, THANK YOU FOR YOUR KENDRICK ART. 🗣️🤎🕊️
Kendrick is the kind of success story that encourages me as a underground artist with a small following. Seeing how he’s developed his skills and slowly blown up after seizing each and every opportunity he’s been giving has been inspirational! Mans has quickly become a mainstay in the industry and for good reason. Dude is too nice! I know if I put in the work, I can reach a larger audience some day too, but for now, I’m happy being a supporter. My turn will come too. Salute to Kendrick🔥
SAMPHAAAA LETS GO!! Always good to see that man ❤
I can't believe sampha actually sounds like that live 🔥🔥🔥
Kendrick and Sampha on the same stage🔥. Dope Song!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sampha representing the UK🤞🏿
Ummm I'm gonna need that LA hat 🧢  pgLAng that's sick
bow down to the king.
欲を言えばサンファピアノ弾いてほしかったけど最高だ〜大好きfather time
Can’t say sword?😂
Amazing 👏
Sampha really not hitting those high notes 😂😂
🔥🔥🔥
Top 5 Kendrick songs easily! One of his most vulnerable and honest songs and a valiant effort to face the generational stigma that men face and inevitably pass down to their sons. Men, I hope you can break down those walls that were built around us. Express yourselves, get in touch with your emotions and don’t be afraid to show them. The strongest thing a man can do is let down his guard 💪
This shit hard
I was at the big stepper concert I love Kendrick
this was way better than the rich spirit - N95 performance
This Year Has Been Blessing♥️💛
What an amazing performance by the both of them. I'm weirdly impressed with how well Kendrick was able to censor his own lyrics live
His live vocals mannn🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Omg sampha
I love Sampha so much, I NEED that sophomore album as I adore Process so much.
Kendrick Lamar & Tyler the Creator are 2 of the best performers especially with set design
I love Kendrick
Sampha to me is so underrated he’s amazing
Bro was moving in slow motion like fo fo 😂,🔥🔥🔥🔥 make a movie out of this album we have the soundtrack already!💪🏾
Fire. 🔥
Whiplash drums on tpab would go hard
Come to Brasil Kendrick we luv ya
This so nice finally
lyrics    You really need some therapy Real nigga need no therapy, fuck you talkin' about? Nah, nah, you sound stupid as fuck Shit, everybody stupid Yeah, well, you need to talk to someone Reach out to Eckhart  I come from a generation of home invasions and I got daddy issues, that's on me Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see Daddy issues run across my head, told me, "Fuck a foul" I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house I stayed outside, laughin' with my friends, they don't know my life Daddy issues made me learn losses, I don't take those well Momma said, "That boy is exhausted," he said, "Go fuck yourself If he give up now, that's gon' cost him.c Life's a bitch You could be a bitch or step out the marginc I got up quick I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues  Early mornin' wake ups (Ah) practicin' on day-offs (Ah) Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chase Early mornin' wake ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah, day-offs) Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser  I got daddy issues, that's on me Lookin' for, "I love you," rarely empathizin' for my relief A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee 'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself Man should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped His momma died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon? His first reply was:,"Son, that's life, the bills got no silver spoon" Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma'nem This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific (Ah) Need assistance with the way I was brought up (Ah, ah) What's the difference when your heart is made of stone And your mind is made of gold And your tongue has made of sword, but it may weaken your soul? My niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensatin' Learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' gangsta I love my father for tellin' me to take off the gloves 'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was And to my partners that figured it out without a father I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes 'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues  Early mornin' wake ups (Ah), practicin' on day-offs (Ah, day-offs) Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah) Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser
Brooo Sampha with that hook 🔥🔥🔥😭😭😭
2:24 he’s messing up on the same lyrics i do, he just like me fr
One of my fav songs of the album. Love you Kendrick! ❤
And now my heart is made of uhhh thanks Kenny
Thats so damn hard
Definitely hurts to see Kendrick now. Being religious as I am and after listening to this album when it released, Kendrick just is not with god anymore based on the beliefs he’s recently stood for. It sucks also because there’s gems on the album for sure like this song specifically but the overall of who Kendrick is now is basically just the forsaken version of who he was. No true love for god, only true love for himself to become one. Imma pray for some true healing for Kendrick, pray for him to receive healing from our true Elohim God, not heal by another mans philosophy.
When sampha stood up I thought they had dog ears on him 😭😭
bruhh why is it censored
This new thumbnail for snl
#BlackFathersMatter ❤️
One of the greatest rappers!!! Kendrick and J. Cole and my top favorites
Best performance damn
Man 😔
🐐
the walls really closing in on him..
I cried
i need that hat
So much talent in one video. Kendrick is one of the greatest poets of this generation
🔥🔥🔥
SAMPHA NEEDS A NEW ALBUM
Excellent!
I need Sampha to collab with Drake one more time
absolute L on SNL to sensor art
modi idi naxui ra )
It's so great to see Sampha, man. Process is goated album, i strongly recommend checking that joint. Hope he will release the new album soon.
king
Im that ninja
i need that pglang cap
Kendrick always making the vibe
Wow it sounds like the album version do you know how hard that is for an artist to replicate
I love how Kendrick can make a music video look like it took a cool million, while still working with a set concept as simple as this that still fits well within the universe of the album.
This hit home I listened to this about 10X straight when I first heard it
⭐❤👏🎼
Give Kendrick his 💐 him and only j cole are the  only Artist that can give us classic after classic album and makes us wait 5 or more years and Consistently drop classic after classic
Never figured Kendrick would actually grab Sampha to perform this song live for some reason. That's a cool touch
🖤🔥
Shoulda did that inteelude and have kodak step out
I didn't even need to have the volume up to know this was a great performance but can we please talk about that unnecessarily drippy hat though. I gotta find a way to get one
1000/
❤️ sampha
A very important song, not just within our community but all races. Yeah we get bashed on for the stereotype of “not having a father”. But the undertone to that joke is true pain, we know for the most part Mothers love is unique. With that said the love from a Father just hits different. This song will help us break that chain young KINGS!!! Be blessed
W
Goat
incredible
Sampha’s has the coolest singing voice ever
Man... another verse and they woulda got crushed to death...
Father Time! Again in my top 3 of the album 🎯🇿🇼🇿🇦
pgLang
i hate the censor, just because it's distracting me from appreciating the performance
I LOVE YOU
Sampha is so great, he's a double feature.
If this song doesn’t speak to mens souls then idk what does
Que grande el Kendrick 🙌🏻
Kendrick Lamar featuring Sampha featuring Sampha
Had me thinking 💭 damn don't smash Kendrick!! Dope though
My favourite from the album
Rap Album of the Year to me to many great real songs on there
The Art is crazy!
I like how Sampha is hear performing a feature … where’s the album sir? 😂😂😂
It’s the live visuals for me. That whole album was 🔥
Real music
Imagine if Kendrick and Taylour preformed We cry together.
Thank you for being on the show.
This censorship is egregious fam
Kendrick Lamar is goated Frrrr
im crying i love u so much. thank u for giving us this piece of art
damn that hat hard asf
The performance sounds practically exact as the real song.
All flowers go to kDOT but bro. Sampha been out the loop & his presence in the industry doesn’t go unnoticed. 🎉
W
As a classical musician,I never been into rap/hip hop but this guy blew my mind and changed all my perspective after listen to his discography  he definitely is the greatest of our times
sampha's got a great voice
yessssirr king keennyyy
First couple bars always brings a tear to my eye
Love that he pays homage to TOP DAWG on this song particularly with his appearance and LA on his crown  King Kendrick is calculated and too hard
Bro how did I miss Father Time😭😭😭😭
As soon as this finished I just immediately heard the keys to the interlude immediately after 😅
2:22 why did he have to censor this part?
early morning wake ups practicin' on day offs
PERFECT TIMING ..
Kendrick the goat
Kendrick and Kanye have the most aesthetically pleasing snl performances
One of the songs of all time
Great job guys! It’s great to see Sampha performing live with you!
Powah HITTAH and just so beautiful
Shout out to all of us that didn't have a dad to grow up with
K lamar Ladies And Gentleman
This song healed me. Fucking healed me. I have been listening to this album daily since May y’all. I fucking feeel soooo DAMN seen! Thank you brother Kendrick.
seeing sampha perform makes my heart happy
Kendrick delivers each verse with PURPOSE & true passion!
One of the best damn "hip hop" live performances K-Dot... AKA KING KENDRICK 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hey kendrick lamar I love your music 🎶 🎵 ❤️
Sampha's voice is fucken amazing. What a song
that virtually insanely great!
Sampha was relatively quiet since the release of his solo album and it’s great to see him back especially on a Kendrick album
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
If that fit ain't LA swag, then I don't know what is! Hoodie with the white T and cap. Sheeesh got me missing home.
Excited to see sampha out and about again
I love how real goats don't need to show off expensive or luxurious outfits and jewels, they dress in a plain and simple way, letting the talent speak for themselves. Shoutout to geniuses of rap like Dot and J Cole. Great performance, loved the intimacy of the setting, kinda reminded of Van Gogh's bedroom.
Damn sampha sounds CDQ as fuck
was surprised when sampha got up... thought he was gonna face the wall the whole time lol
He's miming
Gracias. Esto es Hip Hop. Esto es arte. Esto representa al barrio.
Escher aesthetic?
it's impossible for him to miss
I whish Kendrick Lamar can release all his songs man 🔥😩😂🐐
Best artist in the world
Anybody else notice the walls closing in
The best rappers call only 3 people to make an unreal sound: Mike Dean, James Blake and Sampha
What a song
Fav kwa hii album
Hate how censorship takes the feeling out of anything
Hi Sampha :)
Had the pleasure of seeing his show in Sacramento, unforgettable night from the 🐐
supa hot fire
Kendrick’s clothing fits so well. Fabric goals
that boy is different
Man's got sampha out the house!!! Beautiful song
THANK GOD I'M ALIVEEEE🤣🤣
That pg LAng hat is so fire!
Kendrick is the best  live artist in the world
Man Sampha got a really great voice I love it
W
kendrick performing on SNL just hits different
I love Sampha
anyone see that cap?
When you're a true artist, it's easy to lose inspiration in a world flooded with trendy garbage. That's why guy's like Kendrick is a rare breed, and is very necessary for the culture.
Did Kendrick make you think about it?
🐐
🐐
Too deep for TV
Mr Morale Album of the year . Thank you for this record . Love you man ❤
#Love 😘❤️💎🔥🦁🤟#
Deep love ✌️❤️
Sampha give us a fvcking album already its been 6 years!!!
💯
Masterclass !!!!!!!!
LY KENDRICK
greatest rapper of all time, idc. Atp saying top 5 is disrespectful 😭 Mr. 1-5 is all we’re addressing him as !!!
fuck the censorhip
The best rap song of the year
Love that pgLang snapback Kenny got on
Track hits different after I lost my papps 😭
My first REAL exposure to Kendrick Lamar was on SNL many years ago with "I".  I was impressed.  His stage presence and lyricism move you.  Led me to see him live for his D.A.M.N. tour with Jay Rock and School Boy Q in West Palm Beach then again this year in Tampa for Mr. Morale.  This guy will remain one of the most renowned hip-hop artists for years to come.  Congrats on the deserved success!  His music might not be everyone's cup-o-tea but this 58 year old white dude will continue to support his artistry!
Sampha the goat
Best Mr Morale song and one of the most relatable for us
This song hits the soul EVERY single time
God.. Sampha's voice is incredible.
These Geminis - Genius 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The whole album just amazed me. I knew Kendrick was top 3 of this generation but damn, I wasn’t expecting something this beautiful
What makes Kendrick the GOAT..  Let's just say Kendrick and your favorite rapper are equals bar for bar.. his level of creativity is like no one else, subject matter he touches is like OutKast, his impact is 2nd to only Tupac, and he's had nothing but classic albums.. not just good but classics.. who else can you say ALL of that about?!
After waiting so long for new music from both Kendrick and Sampha, this couldn’t be more perfect.
can sampha PLEASE get his flowers yall
Crazy ❤️..bro
Literally the goat
That PgLAng dodger fitted 🔥🔥🔥🔥
SAMPHA IS SO GOOD
My favorite from the album , when that beat dropped omg
The way Sampha hopped on this performance was so smooth.
Father of time and Mother I Sober. Love those songs. Happy to see you do this one but both of those are very real on many levels.
Another awesome performance. I that was Kodak Black sitting in the chair.
He is the best of all time! And he doesn’t have to talk about killing anyone or disrespecting his sisters either!!
Sampha voice is magic!
Good morning guys here is some New content for small youtubers or anyone thinking of becoming a youtuber!!😁   https://youtu.be/YPfHcytu5Qc
Awesome!
Kenny is definitely one of a kind! Wanna play some dominos!!??😂
Many can relate to this song. ❤
Eeeyyy lomjita unswempu!
This man is invested in every part about music, from the art to song deliverance, how special! Am I the only one that gets that Eazy-E feel from the outfit? 😅
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
so happy to live during kendrick‘s prime
Sampha did a great job on this and this song is just so great! The collab is crazyyy. I can’t wait for me sampha…
he just like me fr
Fucking lit ❤️🔥
U can't imagine, how this masterpiece have Impact on me...

This feeling is Unmatched
Sampha makes every song better. The guy doesn't miss
Te amo Kendrick tu siempre.w entendiste 😭😭😍
When you understand the lyrics of this song . You GOATED 🐐
The best rapper USA news generation
These men are pure...they don’t need studios 😳👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
oof. kendrick is GOD
When 'count me out' finally gets a media run
🔥🔥🔥
Top 5 Kendrick song All Time
❤️
He loves a deep cut doesn't he? Breathtaking
Kendrick is amazing, he is a true poet and is a master at expressing and conveying his words
SAMPHA!!! 😁🔥
The walls are closing in, literally and figuratively. Amazing performance.
All Boys Need A Dad Like That No Cap.  Dad Gives The Tough Teachings Of Manhood And Mommy In Her Loving Nature Helps Them Balance Things Out.  ✨🙏🏽💛✨
In my eyes, I think the only competition Kendrick has is himself.
Who Notice his CAP? pg LA ng he incorporate LA in it
I miss Pac and BIG thank God I witness Kendrick Lamar
AOTY 🔥🔥🔥
First time I heard this song, I shed tears, Kendrick really is the greatest of all time 🐐🙏🏿🤴
This is a love letter to psychology. Thank you so much Kendrick. I'ma be all right. Shalom.
I play this everyday while I am working out 😊
Lighting is awesome
The way he scrap curse words is just too good
Revisited this album earlier today and thought about this being my favorite song. Really cool to see him and Sampha play it live on SNL
Thank you for the inspiration Kendrick.
This song is such a perfect story telling of the toxic masculinity that a lot of young black men are subjected to in our culture. It’s refreshing to see Kendrick intelligently talk about and disavow how toxic masculinity permeates in parenting.
I love it when the live version is just as good (if not better) than the studio cut. No backing track either. These two are kings.
Eazy E and Kendrick - the most unique voices in hip hop history
Kendrick is the greatest to ever do it 🐐
Kung fu Kenny
The message is just 🔥🔥🔥
GOAT doing GOAT things
Love the pgLang hat 🔥🔥🔥
Dot is out here looking like Top😂🔥🔥
This is a breathtaking performance!✨🪐🎧✨
At the end i heard the rich interlude keys in my head.
Can't wait to see this man in November
Does anybody know where I could get that hat
Nice
Kendrick and Sampha's aesthetic together is so beautiful😭🖤
I’m shocked they got Sampha out for a live performance
This is absolutely legendary.
YES.
need a whole concert with kind of set
beautiful
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯 -bigDEF😈😇
This song has consistently hit me at the times in my life when I've needed it most.
Sampha's part is so catchy
Kenny 💯💯💯
😍😍😍
Legend are back🔥
This is seriously one of the best and most powerful songs on the album. This performance was 💥🔥 Love that Sampha was able to bless us live. Beautiful & powerful performance!
The best
Every person I talk to says this one doesn’t connect with them. I like it though.
Thank you!
That 2015 dot look
Probably the best song on the album 🔥
artists that don't need auto tune 🥂
The Best Rapper of all time for me😭😭
Greatness is achieved by those who yearn for it
<3
口にBluetoothスピーカーがある男

Sampha was killing it too, what a combination! ❤️
I finally know what sampha looks like thanks to Kendrick on snl lol
Truly a masterpiece.
A beautiful artist.
Love from India big fan bro 💕💕💕
Damn Kendrick ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love this new video
🐐
Yes this song is definitely top ten fav . Makes me appreciate fatherhood while I did not have my father growing up. That line where he mentions not passing the trauma down due to not having it inflicted on the ‘ones without a father’, is a really deep line for me. I would like it to be true but there are daddy issues, then there are no-daddy issues. $chonkyintl for hurricane Ian relief.
🔥 🔥 🔥
Kendrick is sooo good even if your not into him. You still have to rate/respect him that shows greatness 🫡.
Good to see sampha looking healthy
TQM Kendrick
I swear if the song was just the Beginning as a loop he’d kill that shit.
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐 the Goat
Music should never be censored.
Nobody better... Please...
So great to see Sampha here too, he has such a beautiful voice.
officially thr first from Kenya
woow
Therapy in a song. This is how you craft art.
Claiming my spot
Can’t wait to see him live next month at the 02 arena in London. This is just a taste of greatness to come from Kung Fu Kenny 🔥🌟❤️
That was beautiful
that mama died bar always makes me cry
That’s the GOAT🔥🔥🔥🔥 🐐
sampha sounds great live
"His momma died, I asked him why he going back to work so soon? His first reply was, Son that's life, the bills got no silver spoon" one of the hardest bars Kendricks ever said😮‍💨😮‍💨
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This Kendrick Lamar song has more creativity, effort, and heart than most rappers will produce in their lifetime
Definitely the evolution of KDOT
All time my hero and mentor
Father Time!  A personal favorite off this Masterpiece of an album. 🔥💥🔥
✨🫂✨💖✨🙌🙌🙌
two reclusive kings
This is amazing 🔥🔥🔥
ART !!
Im Smoking to  this  too. I admit it
Nice bro.. good stuff!! I hope your doing well
Bro is definitely the G.O.A.T 🔥

This song is a true musical masterpiece.
This album is going to impact a lot of people's lives for generations to come
The first time i heard the song I cried. I love you kendrick

🔥🔥🔥
did kenny mean to change the lyric @ 1:54?
Bro it’s midnight in Cali cmon now
My king
❤
My dude right here's always speaking the real. And I'm not talking that drill rap BS.
KENDRICK LAMAR is the BEYONCÉ of RAP 👏🏾
Kendrick Is the king of the rap
this is lip synced right?
do another show in LA
Kendrick "the GOAT" Lamar
This song needs a Grammy
Sampha have an ok voice but his mouth area cringy to me . Uggghh !
I was hoping he would perform this song
Tqm Kendrick 💗🐐
Kendrick's live performances always deliver, particularly in set design. It's not obvious in this video until the final moments, but the way the walls literally close into the duo is classic Kendrick shit, really highlights the message.
I've bought every album I could find
I love you
Both of these guys got crazy talent that this being live on a stage that’s literally collapsing in on them and broadcast to millions sounds just as good if not better than it did in the studio. It’s unbelievable.
i just love this man
I'm glad Kendrick took hit time with this album
Muito foda essa ideia do quarto ficando menor, essa música me pega muito

best song of 2022 btw

My favorite artist! Picasso I like it!!
Top 2 greatest rappers alive and he not 2
To be honest I think he should've played something like silent hill
we here
Remember how the media or should I say the news tired to  put a bad image on Kendrick Lamar for the song be Alright... like they say the news  and media is the new evil
Perfect
One of the best Kendrick songs ever.
My nigga 4 life ❤😇🏁💙
Finally the live version from the best tracks from Mr Morale and The Big steppers, this song is majestic, sampha is an extremely versatile and talented artist!
Kendrick is our favourite ❤️💫
Mesmerizing memorization is always on point cutting out words and always smooth …
the way he naturally stops when there is cursing
TEMAZO 🔥🔥🔥
Parabéns irmão Kendrick pela sua persistência na alta qualidade de entrega do serviço público   https://youtu.be/bbtYrVNdLFQ
Playboi Carti invented music? I mean yeah, he did. You’re not gonna get any debate from me on that. He literally invented music. He was there at the dawn of rhythm, the chromatic scale, tonality in general. He invented all of it.  Playboi Carti invented space and time?  Yes, which is why people are so confused about the whole Playboi Carti invented music thing. Because it’s only through his invention of space and time that he was able to go back and plant the seed of music in the human DNA millenniums ago, so he could go back in time, plant his seeds of music, lay the groundwork, put that influence down, but simultaneously live currently amongst all of us, in which we should feel blessed to be in the same era of existence as the creator of music, space, and time,  King of R&B, Sir Playboi Cartier the Third
Sampha has one of the most unique and angelic voices I’ve ever heard
My favorite song off the album
the best to ever do it.
Im from Angola, we love u King Kendrick 😎

Kendrick te amo 🫶🏽🫶🏽
Probably the best song on the album
One of the best songs on this album 🙏🏾🔥 this song really hit deep for me, even though I couldn’t relate to it, I have seen up close what it looks like for a man/woman to not have their father in their life or have a dysfunctional relationship. From “we cry together” to “crown”, this album really puts a mirror to “the culture” and a lot of people have to realize that they gotta to that inner work like Kenny 💯
Watching from South Africa 🇿🇦 ❤
FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My favorite song ❤️💘🥺💞

Everything about this was beautiful
How is it possible for these two GREATS to be in the same room!!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
