Oop- math mistake. 5:43 we get paid $20 but it only goes up $10, but it balances out at the survey 8:47 when we get paid $20 and it goes up $30. LOL sorry. Lots of math, not enough sleep 😴
Preston finally getting his first money :) Oh wait, he didn't start at $0.01! Cheater...

You realize you could have just put money in the stock market, right?

10:27 ayoo! 🤨🤨🤨
5:46 I recognize the guy at the doors face
Ryan, instead of PAYING for a drink, you can just ask for a water cup and they'll give it to you for free. It's the same size, and if not it's like a milliounce (that doesn't exist) smaller. Drinks are like three bucks and YES I KNOW this challenge is over but it's a good tip for every Chipotle lover nonetheless.
Wait dr mike reset it but at the beginning it says 18
Jupiter is so cute!!❤
the singing was amazing Ryan!!🤣🤣
ryan seems like such a fun guy to be around

I am Christian I believe Jesus died on the cross for our sins so we would be saved. By faith are we saved not of works. I believe this because we are all guilty of sin and deserve punishment. God is right and just and is a just judge so he can't just let sin go unpunished like if someone gets arrested but then says I did all these good things they are still guilty but then if someone comes in and takes the blame for us and confesses for doing the crime, then they are free to go. That person was Jesus. That's why I believe in Christianity I am not trying to disrespect anyone's religion❤❤❤❤❤

First God created Humans and we sinned against him and since God is right and just he can't let sin go unpunished and we deserve so he sent his son to die for all our sins and take our help punishment for us trust that that's the only reason your going to heaven u will be saved. By faith u are saved not of works Ephesians 2:8-9 that being said tho that doesn't mean go sinning like crazy cuz u know ur going to heaven u should still try to live for the Lord. But let me be clear the only reason we are going to heaven is because of what Jesus did for us that alone saved us so trust in him❤❤❤❤

"What is the lesson, what is the takeaway, don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway", and his awkward smile after, basically saying "sorry I had to" had me laughing so hard for some reason.
Bro those ants were huge
This series should be named how to travel america with food delivery jobs!
Lawn mowing business is tough these days, I recommend for that to work you need a car that will go past houses with slightly overgrown grass. Not too high or that will take forever. Either they are too busy/lazy to do it or don't have a lawn mower. Then drop leaflets and in a week or so you might get a call.  But you need a full service, i.e line cut, clippings taken away (so you need a catcher and bag) and on top a blower to tidy up the look.
11:20 HOLY CRAP. LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THOSE THINGS
Tommmmmmm
Love for jupiter
Doa Doa no mi
No
Ryan:omg look at the ants. Me:AAAHHHHH
In my opinion it is highly unlikely that the Production is not sponsored by MC D and Chipotle.
Isaiah potato feels like drake's long lost brother
0:00 you are my sunshine
Who else is watching in 2024? 🤑
I’m pretty sure Brandon and Patrick are vampires.
There's no reset???
this day is my birthday
I love how Ryan is buying coffee every day of the series
I wanna go back to 2023 and subscribe during this month because I can’t donate,that’s how good this series is
Mission
Royal complete Ryan Trahan
Something Flamingo said in a video for some reason:  "Ladies go to Jupiter to get more stupider"
Yo tenga  *I don't think I spelt it right*
*11:36* Ryan: What's the lesson what is the takeaway don't mess with Maui when he's on a breakaway  Me: *smiles since I just liked it when he said that*
My favorite part of these videos so far is the dog walking gig. It makes him so happy!
my gf is also crazy
Facial hair grow in?!?
Geaux Tigers!
bro ik its like 2024 but isn't the survey app against the rules bc all profit must come from the penny?
E
How come the 100K donation from Doctor Mike didn't do a GREAT RESET?
Imagine the people’s faces who haven’t seen Moana.
These videos literally cheer me up on my hardest days and man you never cease to make me laugh! I'm so amazed by your skills and how you're able to make money so fast! Can't wait to see you do more of these Ryan!

Every night is a good good night when you're binging the penny series a year later.
“ love Jupiter “
I’m surprised so many people said no. That’s such a reasonable price
What the fuck was he saying?
i love to just hear at the start of the video "good morning", very fun!!!
the ant bit is quality content
Chipotle need to make a burrito about the penny series
How is he still alive with this diet?
0:18 Wait..... why didn't Dr. Mike's donation trigger a Great Reset? It was more than $50,000. And don't you have to get a tattoo now?
I'm still confused about why Ryan only eats at McDonald's in Chipotle? Doesn't make a whole lot of sense other than he's trying to save money. But there's plenty of cheap restaurants. Why not switch it up? That's kind of a strange diet for these videos.
Imagine my family name is trahan😅😊love you doctor mike😂🎉
I would sub but i have been for over 3-4 years
Toot toot!!! Uranus!!!
70% chipotle 30% McDonald’s 0% vegetables

At this point Ryan is 90% McDonald’s and chipotle
Jeez, those ants are huge

Jupiter is the coolest dog I’ve ever seen!
READ THIS!!!  Luke 15:7 I tell you, in just the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance. 🎉🎉🎉  Is it just wonderful to know that when you are saved, there is a party in Heaven. Just for you.That is how much you matter to God.  Believe in the Righteous Almighty God, and be saved.  Do you want to have a relationship with someone who loves you beyond any other love. Someone who sacrificed himself for you and everyone on this Earth the one who created the heavens and the Earth be creator of everything do you want to be saved. Do you want eternal life with peace and joy forever your answer is Jesus if you do not know who Jesus is read the following Jesus is the Son of God that came to this Earth to save the people of their sins. when God-created Earth sin same came into Earth and tempted Eve(The first woman) to eat the fruit that God had forbidden her and Adam to not eat. If they do, they will die. Not immediately,  but death is certain. Eve ate the fruit and gave Adam some to eat as well. And he did. That showed that humans are sinners and not perfect. That is why Jesus came to Earth to save humans of their sins. This leads to a relationship with God(the main reason) and eternal life. He did that by dying on the cross. 3 days later, he resurrected. The story of Jesus is beautiful. If you do not already have a Bible, purchase one. If you do not have the money, pray to God about you wanting a Bible and if he could please provide one for you. This does not mean a Bible will come from the sky and land on your hands. Pray to God every day. But to not be blabbering that just say a bunch of words to try to impress and show off to other people or to impress. This does not mean long prayers are bad always pray out of the heart. Give thanks also when you pray. The Father   (also God) sent his only son Jesus Christ to die for you. Rejoice brothers and sisters because your price was payed by Jesus Christ death. Acts 16:31 They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus , and you will be saved- you and your household." 🎉 Jesus loves You, smile, isn't that just amazing❤😊🎉 Keep trying, no matter what problem that you face. The power of God can strengthen you, and help you, just turn to God all glory to the almighty, and only God ❤😊

Deca is the two easy on me
The lawn mowing might have failed because you shouldn't mow a lawn when it's sunny. It will scorch the grass.

Not to be rude but why America
It's so funny that he didn't get the 95$ by uber ate
Love you too Jupiter!!❤️‍🔥
Ryan's rizz is immaculate
When he says ‘I got a feeling, tonight’s gonna be a good night’ it brings back so many memories, at my year 6 graduation we played this song over and over again
This series basically turned into how many mcchickens, chipotle, and coffee a human body take in 30 days?
Lets go tommy
Where the bike
why did this get recommended to me like 5 months later
WTH broccoli and asparagus are my two favourite greens
11:24 Thats what u call ohio ants 😂
Bro is 99% McDonald’s and 1% human
As someone who's allergic to ants 11:20 is my worst nightmare.
Go horns*
Epic
The grossi possi!!!
What i like about this young man is no matter if it's selling water, telling jokes, window washing, dog walking, or lawn mowing he tries to do the best job he can. Work ethic is amazing. And vlogging all of it! Salute
go tigers
What do you do with the money when you get reset 😲
All you do is amazing man

😲 😱
Ryan at chipotle: best part of my day right there Jupiter + Toro: ARE WE A JOKE TO U

“My sweat is sweating” -Ryan 2022

Bro them ants from Ohio
in a few months or no time people we definitely be kicking themselves regret for missing the opportunity to buy or invest in cryptocurrency
i waited this whole day to see ryan slap the burrito!
shouldnt it be reset cuz yesterday dr mike donated 100k?
I love it how i got to see my two favorite you tubers witch are Ryan Trahan and Asahi paper
Already disappointed in all the people tipping $1 but not Andrew flaking entirely with zero tip. 💀
Ryan’s body right now: 70% McDonalds 30% Chipotle
Ryan: I’ve been to chipotle 8 times in the last 3 days The people watching: Huh I thought more
“Three L’s… six L’s make a W.”
His awkward humor is so good seriously
oooo dADDY
Hi
Awsome vids
the beard is growing on me
Wait where is great reset? Doctor donated 100k ?
go jupiter!!
The ah oh 🤣
In this series i realise we have lawn mower rentals and maybe anything rentals
This series proves that an adult needs his morning coffee
best part of day; chipotle jupiter: whyyy
Am I the only only one getting frustrated with all the $0 tip orders he’s getting. Like really tip these people something.
It literally makes my day that he loves the same chipotle burrito every time and the slap of the burrito is golden. I’m inspired to slap burritos now.
Hi Ryan I love you and your videos  You should do a video where you cross eroupe  on 0.1 euro  If you do I will donate 69 . 69 pounds every year for ten years
The ants 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣 ryans train of thought.   Gets to his hottest destination where ppl need the most hydration annnnnnddddd nah son lets  go cold call cutting grass 🤣🤣🤣🤣  boi ypu hard on.yoself chile'
the ants r huge
When Ryan’s like he activated the great reset, he donated 50,000 dollars to feeding America and the guys he’s talking to is like he’s generous
It’s settled, IsaiahPhoto is now Isaiah Potato      ( sorry if I spelled anything wrong )
4 L s make a W bro its COMMON SENSE
the guy at 17:40 ran a marathon in crocs, its so weird to see him in a ryan trahan video, his name is Isaiah pohot if you wanna see it
Hey don't worry. It was your first bad investment. Rest were epic!
If me east got to 16:56 I feel bad for him 😅
Have you ever thought that 300 years ago if you did this you would be dead/killed
E
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
a
a
11:35 this part was so funny😂
I thought it was going back to 0.01$ because you got more than 50,000$ from the doctor gave you more and you still have your money you didn't reset
I think your the kind of dude who finds ketchup spicy
11:15 Genuinely thought you found huge black ants on the ground.
Eat somewhere else for once lol
This series taught me the magic of mc chickens, fr better than big macs
You”r gay :(
Question Ryan have you ever had a burrito other then chicken rice and cheese?
Ayo Uranus
Cut the horns u long horn😂
Where and when did he even charge his phone
and the tapestry here on my skin, is a map of the victory's I win look where I've I make everything happen look at that mini Maui ma manny ha ha ha ha HEY! well any way let me say your welcome for the wonderful world you know what can i say exept your welcome cause' Maui can't do anything but float, your welcome. And thank you!     HEY!
18:12 I'm literally eating broccoli right now because I'm a giga and how dare he disrespect my giga ways?
POV my brain when Ryan sed Uranus “saved to memory’s”
The dog walking app seems like a viable money option but Uber eats/door dash really don't pay enough it's sad
Jupiter had headphones that’s why he did not respond 😂
I'll describe you in one word "short"
100 k doesent reset?
Am I the only one who noticed that Ryan eats one item of food at a time and not like take a sip then have a bite- ya know? Idk maybe I’m wrong:0
Why didn't you put the money in a bank
He Eats Mcdonolds Every Video😂
OMG😂😂 pause on 16:24
the survey thing should be against the rules because the money didnt come from the penny
But you got reset last night?
💀 THAT POSE 17:43 ITS SO FUNNY!
Isn't it ironic that Ryan is delivering a penny to mrbeast and he's wearing an LSU shirt and Viking played for LSU
you really got me at the ants part 😅
17:03 low key thought he was giving a thumbs up💀
Jupiter is so cute
Shopify has there priorities right
My grandpa do it for 45bucks
Is no one Gonna talk about Ryan meeting Isaiah photo? 😂
The ants😂

Im just started watching your video and i love it.
I love jupiter
Hi I be watching you your videos send you had 1sud i. Was your 2sub
bro he was in my Neiborhood
I think Ryan’s brain was like coffee lol
To Andrew that tipped Ryan $0 on door dash, he finished this series without you
Bruh
Is it just me or is watching Ryan mow reallying satisfying.
@Ryan Trahan, what was your favorite episode of the series?
We love Jupiter !
I feel bad for your legs you must be so soar after all that riding. Especially if you try to sleep and you feel all that pain in bed I hate that feeling. I feel the pain dude.
6:26 When you go trick or treating and no one answers the door:
Isaiah Photo catched up
Ryan: “All profit must come from the penny” Also Ryan: *continues to use surveys for money*
Can we just say chipotle cup/water is expensive😂
it's so wild to me that people use delivery apps and then tip $0 and $1. go pick it up yourself if you don't want to spend the money.
15:27 was also waiting for that moment 😂😂
If I were to travel across the country I live in and had to stop by my home town, I would have a hard time not going home and playing games. So props to Ryan for not getting distracted like that!
GROSSI POSSE!!!
Coulda told ya it wasn’t gonna be profitable
They over use some songs but still great work Ryan I love this show
I should try that fun drink combo ok 20% lemonade 40% sprite and 40% mandarin aqua Fresca sounds delicious
Cringe
Jupiter gang!!!! 🤧💯
There's a guy who made a 2 hour video about you telling the whole story of those 30 days but a company went there and withdrew the monetization please say he didn't do anything, the name is UTOPIA
We 💗 Jupiter
Ryan for future challenges: You can save the cups from chains and refill them when you want water or a drink in the future since they offer free refills! Love the content  Fun fact: My Bf's uncle has the same cup he had to use every day for a year from In-N-Out when he couldn't afford anything. He's a very successful private pilot now but it's humbling to see that he keeps that in his room still over 15 years later on a shelf.
This guy should do something like 12 days of Christmas or something
I got tricked by the big antw
LOVE these videos! Just have to say that the music, sound effects, and transitions are like 4 notches louder than the vlog footage.
Bro how the kids doing at the pool
Why you no get tattoo >:)
18:08 brandon
the ant part made me laugh so hard
I swear this guy looks like jiedel
Day 18 of commenting 🎉
YOU GOT ME
Bros probably friends with the people at chipotle now
Ykl
Xd
This guy should also be a comedian
WHEN RYAN SAID "DONT MESS WITH MAUI WHEN HES ON THE BREAKAWAY" RIGHT AFTER I DID-
Bro has the social skills of a 3rd grader
Omg just got back to watch the series and you have 10M so fast! You earned it!!
So the key to getting mowing customers is to leave the mower in the driveway, and look for the lawns that look bad, because if somebody has a good looking lawn, they don’t need somebody to mow for them.
Isaiah 🤣

My Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Great Great Great Great  Great Great Great Grandpa: Back in my day that was normal size.

OMG I love your voice.
One lesson is make sure you have clients before you spend money. It worked with the window washing!
I love this series!!!

The Nagy
McDonald’s should sponsor him. The series is making me crave McDonald’s and I barely eat McDonald’s!
Ryan trahan talks to WOMEN? He has a trait we gamers will never see
He should use sweercoin  to servive the challenge
Im andrew
0:06 idk
You scared me when you said that the biggest ant i omg
The part where the one person you were interviewing said "I think he fakes giving money to people" and then the payment proof was edited on screen was so funny to me. I've missed this series ever since it ended but it's fun to come back to it. We love you Ryan
Ryan get burrito: best part of my day right there  Jupiter: 😭😭😭

Woo! I’m watching this entire series and it just makes me so happy to see so much money being raised and Ryan just having fun with this
I love Jupiter
when he quoted moana 😂
Mom- "What you watching?!" Me-Burrito Hub!
Imagin some dude wakinnk into yore  stor for7days in a row said howdee gets a ice coffee then leaves never to be seen again
Why does a 100k donation not cause a GREAT RESET?
this guy is gonna die eating borutoos
17:24 IASAH PHOTO HAS MORE SUBS THAN THE ROCK
i think ryan shoudlve first asked people who needed their lawnsowed before buying the mower
Watching him interview people was so hilarious.
17:11 DAMN SHE IS TALL
I know it's for views and doesn't really matter but imagine how much more money he would have made had he just been a lil more patient and picky on the delivery apps and not taken as many orders for the cheap tippers
“asparagus.”                  - Patrick, 2022
We love you Jupiter! 💕🐶
Driest burrito of all time.  Im sure they dont charge extra for some sauce cmon dude
Why did you not reset 🤔🤷🏽‍♂️
Is walking dogs better then delivering for Uber or grub hub?? For making money
16:24 funniest part of the whole series😭
Ive been watching Ryan’s videos for 1 week straight
18:00 my short baybe
Jupiter gang
Did anyone see those eyes in the background at the end?
Didn’t he get reset in the last episode? How does he have money still?
do you guys know which survey app he used?
I died laughing when he thought a bug was on him for some reason Lol
App: what have you ate for this week Ryan: mic chickens and rice 🍚chicken 🐔 and cheese 🧀 burritos🌯
So how is he charging his phone and camera equipment etc?
11:20 😂😂
Too easy army
Jesus loves y'all and Is The Way To Everlasting life
You got reset in day 17 tho
What’s the name of the walking app
17:24
Hello Ryan me and my cousin have been watching your videos and we got inspiration from your penny seris and we  are going to be doing this on vacation. Just like you all the money we make will be donated to charity. Thank you so much Ryan!
Jupyter keeping it so classy with that Bow ties. ⋈
Go Tigers
Now he doesn't miss his dig as much
Not me binging 10 episodes a day because i was late
I love Jupiter HASHTAG JUPITER EVERYONE
Bruh dude were is my man Paul Dodds?

18:20
Howdy
Who’s going to tell this guy sprite is just lemonade
I love Jupiter 🥰❤️
14:18
What’s the music at 0:38 on the video
andrew cheap
I also love chipotle burrito 🌯😋😋😋 like 👍
My godmother’s dog name is Jupiter
How is he using the penny to make profit on Wag? He uses the bike which he bought to make profit on Uber Eats but he isn't using the Og penny to pay for Wag in any way... Failed challenge?
Ryan you need to work on your mowing skills
I love you
DUDE PUT SOME SUN SCREEN ON
These people ordering food delivery and not tipping should be ashamed of themselves.
Americans produce so much waste..
Ryan just feels like if u smashed William Osman and Casey Neistat together aha
Every day I have nothing to do you make my day thank you bro
How do you shower and charge the camera and your phone
disappointed you didn't keep the lock from the first bike
I have a lawn mower exactly like that, he might have the same one as I do
“I think he fakes giving money to people”   Everyone: WE’RE TRIGGEREDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Dude would be bezos if he sold waters everyday
mcdonalds needs a ryan trahan meal
He forgot to smack the burrito 🌯 at the end
Ryan’s diet is every kids dream.
ryan had me crying laughing when interviewing people because of how timid and awkward he is. it’s so precious
I honestly don't know how he eats on mcdonalds and chipotle I think I'd have withered after 3 days of no nutrients
i dont have much to say , but SLAY RYAN
Ryan's body   89% vanilla iced coffee  1%burgers 10%chipotle
4:16 3 2 1 LET IT RIPPP
What happened to Paul Dodds' donation?
Thought you had a reset since doctor Mike donated 100,111
Burrito+Chicken+White Rice+Cheese ain't a dish anymore. Its a feelin'
imma be so sad when i finish this series
I love how still positive he is after getting rejected a bunch of times and only getting 1 client. Also, I didn't realized my grandpa was watching at the back and told me to tell Ryan to comb his hair sometimes 😂 - Day 18
The ants 😂 ……..i need sleep.
Yo that’s amazing to see that Tom Grossi donated he is a really good NFL YouTuber, besides the fact he is a Packers fan. 🧀😠👎🤝😀
I love the series but damn, the non existent American food culture is killing me.
18:24 bro y that kinda look like carewellington
wait. the doctor donated 100k and there was no GREAT RESET?
Where did you used to charge your phone?
How is Ryan so inspirational
everytime you do uber eats i just wanna guess how much money you will have after getting the money lol
shopify and the awsome 69420 dono
Should have tested the local market for lawnmoving like he did for window cleaning. Would have avoided wasting half a day :) It's easy to say afterward though :)
This is such an good video to watch today at my home and nice editing dude :)
Let's Go
I absolutely love the animations they are so great.
OMG HE GOT A PLASTIC STRAW 😯😯😯😯😯
I can't believe he posts good videos like this EVERYDAY
Both of those veggies they said are my two favorite
brandon and patrick so fine
Hehe June 18 is my bday 💕 no one asked. Just loved this episode and knowing it was filmed around my birthday is cool.
I want Jupiter 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
Loved when the video went full Eric Andre lmao
Gotta respectfully say that I am simping for JC 😂😳
16:22 💀
chipotle needs to sponsor you because after watching that burrito get made so many times I now need it.
How are people not gonna tip hi
You won 500 on the ticket 🤦‍♂️
Bruh you mow a lawn like a vacuum a house😅
I cant stop watching your videos. 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Sleepy heads little plums and dukey
Looking at this man deliver food makes me want to deliver food and earn money
He look’s like a kid with a beard 👁👄👁
15:22 deja vu? i think i saw this in day 10 or 13 something Edit:i think i watched the whole video already idk why
Qh
Jupiter gang! 🎉🎉
i love juppy
Dr. Mike is the 🐐
Wait so 50,000 is a great reset but if it’s 100,000+ it’s not a reset?
Bruh you saw the rocks enemy
Uber on a bike 11:51
The mower mafia
0:43 POV: you're a mcdonald's cashier
really suprised to see isaiah potato and keep it up ryan brohan
jupiter gang 14:13
Ryan better come out of this getting sponsered by Maccies or Chipotle 😂
how do i telegram
I love how Ryan thinks the food deliveries will make u bored but they’re actually the most fun part to watch in my opinion
i think we can all agree Wag is amazing
Technically he had like ten jobs at once.
Bro you need some nutrition, would you drink a smoothie even? Like no fruits or vegetables or any variety...like what? Your iron must be so low, you mostly eat chicken, cheese, grains and coffee...and that's like literally it. I bet if you went on a cleanse so much weird shit would come out of you, stuff that has been trapped in your digestive system for a decade even. Like I bet if you ate a salad even you'd be shitting so much lol your digestive system wouldn't know how to handle fiber and you'd shit your pants immediately lol XD
I love you toro
This video was released on my birthday and now I’m upset that I didn’t get to see it when it came out, but besides that great video and I love Jupiter
Congrats at 10mil
I hope  BRANDON is OK,  🙏 he don't look to good 😕  his skin color is pretty pale. hope ur ok BUD
Cenamatic mode is Movie Mode for chinese
Anyone else coming back to watch?
I just drop my phone on the toilet when watching this video                          I think there's shit in my phone
I don't get it where do u charge your phone??
Ryan would've made more money if he didn't accept low tip orders 😭
hey Ryan EaAt yOuUr VeGtABLLEes!!!!!
it’s weed wacker not weed eater no one eats weed you smoke or smack bc either you smoke it or you smack it away
I wish I was earlier but here is a suggestion for no reason. If there are any 7 ELEVEN's in any of the areas you go, just go to them and grab a Slurpee, sandwich, coffee or whatever because they are surprisingly cheap. (Maybe just in my country but you can check them out)
Is Elizah the girl form jidon vid when he was with cat telling people to not vape
Thanks for the chipotle
Congratulations for getting 10million subscribers
which survey app is he using?
First video where #### ##### is removed
congrats on 10 mil subscribers
Congratulations for 10M subs RYAN!!! This Journey has been amazing and so inspiring to all of us watching!!! I'm so glad to be part of The Journey and more to come!!!!
I would have said no to Andrew. That cheap ass left zero tip! What a POS
5:18 four
.
15:12 imagine selling water there
I live in South Africa. If you leave your bike ANYWHERE even chained, it WILL get stolen. You should probably then take the bike on a leash with you 😂
Yesssir
See that is imprassiv the Camera man got 2,50 😫😂😂
Jupiter gang!
This man has made me bike down to McDonald’s for like a week in a row for a breakfast and biking back like a boss

If Patrick had Brandon's hair it would just be Finn Wolfhard made in china.
Ryan Trahan and Isaiah Photo will make a good duo
i love jupiter
GREAT JOB RYAN

17:43 made me bust out laughing

Love your vids let’s try getting him to 10mil😄
In the words of the cherished Poet Laureate of the early 21st century, Miley Cyrus, "It's not about how fast you get there, It's not about what's waiting on the other side... It's the climb!"
11:18 imagine being terrified of ants and Ryan tells you to look away when he is joking but you don’t think he is and you’ll never know that the ants were really playground toys 🧸
Hey it’s Isaiah Photo
Agua Fresca its an Brazillian word lol
The tittle says 18 but he said 19
Uhmmmm
You should do another series like this Ryan
The most impressive thing in the entire video is how Ryan spent at least one hour eating the burrito while he was doing all the interviews. Literally the sun went down and the burrito was still in his hands.
Dude I swear like four hours ago he had 9.72 million subscribers
First of all
8:34
All I got to say is E
Hhahahaaha cracked me up when the dude said “heheheheheheh look at dis dude”
Best youtube series ever
“Tonight’s gonna be a good night” Next video he got reset
Omg when I saw Isaiah I was so surprised
🪨
The ants💀💀
Did any one else realize that he did not do morning routine
17:30 that’s so goofy ahh
Currently rewatching every episode in one night before Day 30 hits. As of this video, Ryan has: - Been to 4 states. - Been Great Reset 2 times - Been Double Great Reset 1 time - Got 2 $100k Donations
16:21 So it's these people that dislike him... you can see official donations by him lmao
This is like my life except the great reset is when my gas tank runs out
Ryan pays chipotles bills
Math Is Hard But...... idk 18
Ryan buddy we really appreciate you and your hard work to entertain us this is not easy what u r doing. How much u walk how much hard work you put in to your videos. Well if u do something wrong ur not embarrassed by it. So that why man I love you and ur so funny. Keep up the good work😁😁🤘👍
Can I get the outro's name when he reads the name of the people donated!!!!
This series is so motivating because he failed  But he kept trying and got to his goals like he just went from 15dollars up to 92dollars
they are so big
Jupiter is cute
Brown is wrong if Lionhead $19 and he gains 20 then how was he only at $29
at time 17:41 is that isai photo
they said broccoli and asparagus, so eat ur lettuce mf! lol
Should have been selling water at BotG. Also, Hairy Tornado keeps sending me here.
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through get better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen to you
Dude I was at bartin springs when you were at blues on the green 👀
There’s been times throughout this series where I thought you sounded like Tom Grossi so seeing him just now was kinda wild😂😂
I love how he’s always saying “howdy” lol I never hear it and I really like it when people say it :)
I swear Isiah photo donated 5 thousand before
3:50 "6 ls make a w" if you capitalise the Ls then you only need 2 😎 also unsure how you got 6, surely it should be at most 4
i checked 7 hrs ago and for subrcibrs he was at 9.69 then he went to 9.72 which is insane keep up the god work
My cat wrestled a squirrel no joke!!!!🤣😂
OMG THOSE ARE THE BIGGGEST 'ANTS'
11:38 when he said “what is the lesson, what is the takeaway” I had You’re Welcome stuck in my head and started singing it. When he did too... this man is my soulmate.
Bro Shopify really 69,420
Guy that said asparagus knows all
Read my names
Chipotle should make a Ryan Trahan meal and it includes the fun drink and the rice,  chicken, and cheese burrito
JUPITER GANGGGG
Hey you do remember that u have to get a tattoo coz 2 donated 100k
Watching how much you eat hurts my stomach 😂
I need to put this timestamp to keep replaying this moment sorry.  17:43
god dammit, i saw the moana joke coming. All I can say is that you're welcome.
Who’s gonna tell him that a hash brown is a vegetable?
toro gang

Went to college with JC. Absolute legend. Came up huge with the lawn and scratchers
What type of camera do you use?

juipiter gang
One of the best thing about this dude is that he never takes creadat for him self when he achieve something he allows respect us.....
brandon and patrick would look like finn wolfhard if they were combined
Hi Ryan! Have you got the tattoos yet?
“I have been watching mrbeast for 4 years “ growled a deep voice
I love when he does the map in the beginning bc his pfp picture was so funny with his pink glasses
This video made me laugh more than all the other videos before it.
Did you notice he has two phone’s
YOU FOUND ISAIAH!!!
i love you Jupiter
i can feel my allergies starting just by watching him mow grass
@rbt
The Ryan burrito
anyone get a mumbo jumbo vibe from the first guy from the first lawmower guy
Ryan's organs: Veggies? Ryan: McChickens :) Ryan's organs: No seriously, veggies Ryan: Mc :) Chickens :)
Thank the editors for all they do
Hey Ryan do you care if I steal my friends pencil?
I’m surprised he hasn’t hit up Little Caesars
ayo shopify????
19:56 Turdboi240 It tought Jack was faking it-
What you could do Ryan to make sure the reset can’t take your money is to buy one thing with all of the money you make, then return it the next day. 😊
He forgot to reset again 😬
bro the guy at 17:24 was literally in a mrbeast video
KEPP UP THE GOOD WORK
Didn’t someone donate 100k last episode
ryan: stands by chipotle also ryan: ive been here 8 times in the past three days-
ryan: starts to sing me: please stop, just stop please
the thumbnail tho 😌
Jupiter is so cute <3
Ryan: Jupiters a great dog! He’s so quirky and fun! Jupiter: I’m not like OTHER dogs! 💅👁🫦👁
Hey
when he said "all right guys describe me in one word" Me:Short
What does he do with money after the GREAT RESET

truo gang <3
Ryan took a DnA test turns out hes 100 percent *McDonalds and Chipoltle*
ryan hi
Shoulda sold water at blues on the green
Bro when he started the moana reference i immediately thought back to the song before he said the maui line and i was so happy when he actually did it
If I ate like this man I would literally be dead. Jealous.
Is ryan being sponsored by mcdonalds because he should be.
👍
Did anyone else notice a dude in the background the same clothes as him at 17:21
He found 07
Day 19 gone for me! :(
Those red ants are fire ants ur so lucky also Jupiter gang
Wait, Ryan don't all profits have to come from the penny? Not surveys
Buy sunscreen or a little fan
when you sang Maui's rap bit I died, got buried, got revived from the dead, murdered people since I was a zombie, ate my way into a movie theatre, and then watched Moana c: then I went back into my grave and got a good night's sleep
I'm trying to get an shout out so come on let me get more than 10k
Hey I'm trying to donate and it won't let me get more than 10k
Love this series alot its very entertaining also so close to 1-10MILLON meals ryan! haha idk
17:39 The best voice crack you will hear on this series
ah yo Uranus
17:12 avatar 2 sneak peek 😱
i’m confused why did doc mike not start a great reset?
Why didn't he just tow the lawnmower by cheap rope and tie the lawnmower to the bike
Ryan can’t do anything embarrassing in public but on camera he doesn’t care 😂
THE GREAT RESET is by far the funniest thing
17:43 the next day he got jumped in the hood
Nice
why did I actually get excited to see what species of ants he was talking about 😭
Júpiter is sniffin uranus
How come you did not reset
Imagine watching one of this guy's video and then hearing a knock at your door and seeing him ask you to mow your lawn
i like how bros been to chipotle so many times in one day and actually got food while so many players broke roblox because they want a free burrito from chipotle 💀
TOM GROSSI
Grossi Posse appearance lol
Keep up the great work, I hope that after this series, you do more low money to success type video like these
“Did you go to LSU?” “No I got this shirt at a store in Denver”
walking around to 200 ppl….. gets one
Can we talk about how Kat is so huge compared to Ryan
When he said hes a snack i instantly imagined his hair as curly fries
14:44 😂 you’re so funny
Chipotle really needs to donate!!!!
the survey isn't profit from the penny sooooo
Ayo Uranus
On chipotle: can I get an Trahan burrito?
ryan is now 70 percent mcdonalds from this series
Ok so now he has 9.51 mil I was gone for one week and he gains 1 mil subscribers
Lie on the servay app
11:43
After watching these episodes and seeing what people tip. I feel generous compared to others, because I always do at least $5. Seeing those 1/2$ tips frustrates me ngl.
WE WANT ANOTHER ODD ONE OUT SERIES
and the tapastry in my skin, is the map of the victories i win, look where ive been  i make everything happen look at that me mini maui just doing that tippity tappin.
SInce no one said it VOCALS ASF
We all know when he asked them to describe him in one word they said short
Keep up the good work
whats the survey app i need😈
saying hi till my b-day 29th june
why didnt he ride the bike with 1 hand and pull the mower with the other.......
No one gonna talk about Isaiah Photo he has like 6mill subs
That is probably the worst mowing job I’ve ever seen lmfao 🤣
Oh cinematic mode is cool...
Great vid
You should go to McDonald's for water breaks considering water is free there
Lol when Ryan said that there were ginormous ants I was actually getting a bit scared and when he turned the camera i-
When this guy says "Money Making Methods" I can only imagine how many green dragons this guy has killed
Ryan’s body is 90% McDonald’s and 10% chipotle
didn't isaiah donate money himself?  how do they not know each other?
Jupiter is adorable🥺 🐶
Is that L theory correct or is he just trippin 🤔
I laughed at 17:40 so hard in the library lmao 😂
It like if Ryan have any bad investment he always have door dash on his side
We don't have "Chipolete" in Poland but after watching all of these videos I'm going to find some burrito place :D
“Well if you don’t mind I’m going to devour this hash brown”  *continues to take 50 small bites*
URANUS!!!
THOSE ANTS ARE CRAZY HUGE
What’s the survey app called?
WHY DID JUPITER GET NO TREATS!
F4deuuuu
just love how ryan always wats the same thing at chipotle
I just watched ryan delivering a chipotle while I was eating one   edit: I finished my burrito just after ryan started eatin his
In this video: a zoomer discovers what working is.
16:39 this was hilarous!
Omg Jupiter is so cute!! I want a dog like him.
Me seeing Shopify donating $69,429
How come Ryan didn’t activate the great reset since last episode dr Mike activated it
golumm
Where's Paul's donation on the list of top donations?
16:58 what did he drop
I do not think he is gonna reach
"Alkaline!" "Huh, cool," .... "iS tHiS aLcOhOl?!"
he didnt reset himself
POV:my name is miley when miley Cyrus song was playing
Pls tell me what app you used to catsit and walk dogs
1:47 where are the donos from Dodds from the 1st vids? He donated 50k then 100k?
Just heard the news that one of our dogs died. Watching this to ease the pain
Rayan met with paper
11:43  yepppp i have seen
Love your vids
That first house you worked on had a lovely BMW M3
Can’t wait to see all the new tattoos
He is sleeping at home with his girlfriend, not on camera
How do u charge your phone ryan😳
😎
10:35 istg i was thinking the EXACT same thing
THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE GREAT RESET
14:17 bruh💀
You charge the same amount as I do for lawns and u put your hart into those lawns with passion keep it up
I thought when he said “look at these ants, I thought there was going to be a jump scare
hes so nice for tipping the camera man
the idea about cutting grass should be the same about washing windows before.
Ryan is just so awkward
i swear this is the most human interaction ryan has had in an episode yet
As I clicked on this video, a penny that I found earlier fell out of my pocket. Kinda funny
what happened to the reset?
if i every do this i would get a job some where qith a good paycheck for a week and get tons of money that way idk if it would wrok tho
bro that lawn looked awful why did you cut it like that
U have to face spok
If you want a good fun drink 30% blue Powerade 30% orange fanta 40% rootbeer👍👍
bestie the leash on the dog tho it was under the leg which was trigging me dunno if it was only but yea know
17:42 😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro when you said the great reset and you did the half split I was dying😭💀
You know how you've been creating businesses... Isn't one rule that "all profits must come from the penny..." Either way, what you're doing is amazing! And having all profits come from the penny is practically impossible lol. You're an inspiration Ryan! Thanks for all your hard work.
You forgot to reset
GO JUPITER GANG
14:28 my grandma was dancing and Said you where a good singer
You should just keep a chipotle cup in your backpack and then use it whenever you need water so you don’t have to pay
The Uranus joke killed me 😂😂😂
much love from grossiposse
11:36 the second he said that i sang it in my head
Auuufghhh
Spock watching this be like:😧
random question but how do you charge your phone???  ily <333
1:11 Plastic Straw????
howdy! halfway there mate, halfway there!
Watching the people talk at the Mc Donald’s at the start was so funny! 😂
Ryan got $50 for cleaning windows in Las Vegas if he did that 10 times he could of flown straight to North Carolina
10 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS IN 4 DAYS

I feel bad for Ryan's stomach
might activate the great reset😈😈😈😈😈
Howdy 💯😂
Wait what skittle chan skittle chan loves beluga
Are you smol or is Kat a giraffe? 🤔
Your lucky, in Colorado we got hills. So twenty bucks worth of lawn mowing will take just about twice as long for something who isn’t the strongest.
He should have just done this to gain more subscribers than Dr. Phil!
Dont ready my name:) Yes dont read it
Eliza <3
I just noticed that guy he interviewed his name was Isiah Photo he is the one who donated 50k
19:50 Selfpause Positive Affirmations App  well a two-liner is one way to get noticed, another would be the shoutout soon...
Did he not get reset last episode Im so confused
What Survey out does he use?
He says ayo way to much lol
Go tigers
14:47
I love when he poses to say the great reset in front of Isaiah that was priceless 😂
Didn’t Isaiah photo also donate
1st dude was dope
If i give 1 $ then will i get a shotout?
imagine having THE trahan walk your dog
When he was at the festival he should have sold cold beverages it’s would have made him more money
Imagine that Chipotle or McDonald's donated so much money that it reaches past his goal for being probably their best customer😌✋
Stab the coffee
Stab the coffee
4:25 posted out of context this looks like a shitpost
Those ants were huge they scared 😱 me!
How's he charging his phone everyday?🤔🤔
Dang
The ant thing got me saying  " shiver me timbers 😖" .
ANTS!!!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
i feel like the surveys shouldn’t count cuz the money doesn’t come from the penny
Am i the only one or the background music at 0:01 was peaceful

No one gonna talk about the myth the legend ISAIAH POTATO
Wired question do you ever pee. I have never seen you pee.

J
I missed a few videos I feel so baf
(=_=)
I’ve made it this far in two days
Curious why you didn't just pull the lawn mower on your bike? I used to do that when I was a "young boy" like you.  We just held the lawn mower handle and pulled it backwards while peddling the bike.
Cool
17:40 it caught me off guard
Dude. We are gonna get you to 10Mil, Ryan!
dude if u save the cup u don't have to buy a new one 🤦‍♂
Can we just appreciate how he overcome those REJECTION 4:08 and still smile so brightly? Bro through this series I learned how to take rejection as a common and normal experience and don't bother to feel bad about it.  Thanks a lot happy 18th day y'all!
The ants were grown with Pym particles
THE ANTS 😂 I thought he was serious
Ryan is the definition of looking on the bright side
Love u to Jupiter
We have a Pepe’s in Indiana but it’s a whole restaurant

Am I the only one who is going to notice that Isaiah photo literally donated 5000 in the first video and he was on this video
My mum used to be a dog walker when I was little! I used to come with her on the walks!
you should buy a card that holds money like a credit/debit card or buy something with all your money then return it before you leave the state
dang, those are some crazy ants
Did anyone else see the lead hooked under the dogs leg and get proper OCD over it
I mow yards in my neighbor hood and get $40 and hour, it must suck to be you.
I love how he just does awkward things in front of people and doesn’t even care
14:35 gotta work on that singing
Why did he start with money this episode when he got donated $100,111 from doctor Mike last episode??
E :)
dodds who donated 150k is gonne
I love juster
why has the $100,000 donations created the reset? It's happened twice and nothing happened. I'm confused.
Yo Brandon looked like a zombie

"Time to walk Jupiter" has to be the most memorable movie quote of all time.
“So quirky and fun” 💀
Did y’all know he is partnering with a game on roblox? I’m not even lying
My biggest flex is that I’ve been following Ryan since 2016
You got a 100,111 dollar donation last vid, and no great reset?
NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE RX7 AT 4:08
I just noticed your actually starting to grow a beard on your face
How does he charge his phone and camera ?? 🧐🧐🧐
Good job
He acts like he’s shy… but in reality he’s broadcasting this to millions
How do you charge your phone?
That burrito smack tho
what’s the survey app actually called on the App Store I need this haha
I don’t think anyone wants this series to end. It’s literally a part of everyones daily routine, lol.
14:14 hahahaha, i busted up, wtf lol
Crazy how Isaiah was there
I WOULD DESCRIBE YOU AS TINY
By biggest question is how he charges his phone
This was on my bday:)
When 5his series started he had 7.6 million subscribers and now he has 9.2 million😂
My brother take a picture with you

Wait, why didn’t he reset to one penny when dct mike donated?
18:42 Ryan Is so burnt on his face😂
You should buy sunscreen
Ryan hear me out once you get to North Carolina every one is gonna be sad that the series is over. Soooooo I was thinking you should do the same thing back but with a generous gift for hailey……. What do you think?
You calculate wrong
Bro is it just me that think that this should be a Netflix/ Disney series because this is amazing. Keep up the work Ryan love yal
I wonder if he will meet up with PrestonPlayz like how Isaiah Photo met him
bro i get 10 bucks per lawn 😭
Just shows. NOBODY tips with food
Holy smokes thoes ants got me jumping should off listen
I think we can all guess "I've Gotta a Feeling" is his favorite song 🎵
Jupiter I love you!
Loving the series
I think your mowing sales pitch should start with anything BUT hey I’m trying to make money lol
I thought he was fr with the ants until he showed us them 😭💀

Man, I think you missed who Isiah Photo is. He literally gave you the first ever donations lol.
lmao he had that burrito lasting a lifetime
I forgot this series was about feeding America
i thought about this actually... does WAG break the rules? he's gaining money, but it isn't from the original penny. food deliveries are fine, since he's using the bike he got from penny money, but idk what WAG means for the challenge
WTH MY FAVORITE YTRS MET ISIAH PHOTO AND RYAN TRAHAN
Can’t wait for Ryan to get all these tattoos lmao

I wonder if Ryan knows that Isaiah photo is a YouTube
Spock watching like 🙁
16:54 with captions.... that's a pause
ryan! on the end of the video it puts day 20 instead of 19. damn nearly missed an episode 😅
hi:)
How do you charge your phone
The only thing that’s  more consistent than me watching this every day  is Ryan’s chipotle order.
Just wait
the soundtrack for all of these videos is just amazing
I don't think you should just eat junk food, try to get something nutritious and healthy
How do you have over $26 when you got reset at The end on day 17?
respect
What’s that survey app , what does it called?
No great reset? Dr. Mike donated over 100k in previous video.
ASPARAGUS!
Hey ryan in your continent the food is so costly in our country we get 3 burgers its nice and 1 cold coffee for max 200 rupees which is max to max 2.5 $ INDIA

This bro needs to eat something that isn’t chipotle 😂
Nice vid hope you get him that penny
"this guy is so akward"
Ayo, Jupiter check

The way he said Yall though
You should use one of those receipt scanning apps

Can you make a another sires pls ireally enjoy this kepp up GOOD work
I'm still curious what happened to Paul Dodds's donation (I think that's his name)
17:11 bruh just asked that and left
The fact I thought he was talking about army ants
man was mowing the concrete while walking
No it’s 2 L that makes a W if you’re talking lowercase it’s 4
5:51 Conor Mcgregor got a tip
You should do this again but try to sruvive on a dollar for 1 year trying to travel across the world.
17:09 Why cat built like that
bro i love the climb by miley cyrus
If you don't know mrbeast you live under a rock
Andrew with the no tip 💀🤡
Broccoli and asparagus are my 2 fave vegetables 😭😅

What is that one restaurant that was his first doordash of the day, starts with an s, I think it’s shack burger but idk. I had a hotdog from there omg it was DELICIOUS but I can’t remember what the restaurant was called.
Say yolo and come to toronto
the vocal's 10/10 slay Ryan
I have 4 dogs
sit no that’s alright you don’t have too 🤣
The slap
Goofy ahh Isaiah potato
1:34 incase you didn't know. A lot of Mcdonalds do a deal on the hash browns n one or more of their breakfast sandwiches where you buy say 2 hash browns for 2$ as for the sandwiches you'll have to look but some are buy one for menu price get another for a $1. (Atleast where I've been this is the case).
Just start stealing the dogs that you walk
just when you said look at how big the ants are i saw am inch big spider on my wall
I dare you to eat a vegetable. I know you won't xD.
try offerup please and see this
elizah was givin you googley eyes
Genuine question: why do you accept Uber eats and Doordash orders for $3 and even $2? I’ve doordash when I’m bored and I don’t even touch anything under $8. Just curious😁
the climb by Miley Cyrus playing in the McDonald's is maybe the funniest thing I've heard all day
You should come to Norwalk ia
I drive by in my truck at 9:52!!!!! Finally made it to the background of a yt video lol
He’s so awkwardly cringey     Give me more
nlg I cracked up when he showed the ants. 👌👌
Was that 100k not a great reset? Does it have to be exactly 50k? I thought the doctor donation was going to reset him again.
Wouldn’t be a bad investment to buy a razor 🪒…..
THE ANT JOKE i keep thinking about it and laughing randomly that was so funny lmao  And the maui one was hilarious lol
why is paul dodds no longer in first place?
Isaiah photo wait what he is meeting with one of his donors
wait i thought ryan got reset last night
Imagine if he sold water at this concert
Did he not get reset?? Or what
why didnt you reset when you got donated 100k?
hello
As someone who cuts lawns professionally, gotta say that had to be awful lugging that mower around. Good content 👍🏻😂
im still waiting on the tattoos ( 1 from Paul Dodds, and 2 from Dr. Mike )
Ryan’s body be like:  2% Sun Exposure/burns 8% human interaction  10% THE GREAT RESET 40% mcdonalds 40% chipotle

No reset ?????
I thought Ryan had gotten resetted the day before this video
Amazing video, best part was hands down 18:00
What camera do you use
Massively respect what you are doing the work, dedication and the way you present yourself are all so incredibly inspiring. Keep doing what you are doing, you put the fun into fundraising and are recording some crazy numbers. Massive props to you.  That being said, Moana reference best bit 😛
What is the name of the survey app that ryhan is using
Love the jupiter and Uranus part, one of the funnier ones😅
HOLY THOSE ANTS! I’m not usually scared of insects but those ants!
isiah photo lol
I'm just laughing at the bmw m3 parked in a yard with an unmoved lawn hahahaha
That’s so hilarious. I just got done listening to the Climb by Miley Cyrus right before I started watching this video 🤣
he's pointing out the fact they're going to sell the information from the survey, as if that isn't the whole point of survey apps ;w;
Ryan: *eats last bite of burrito* The 15 people he told to cheer when he did: *cheers*
i was so annoyed cuz jupiters leash was under her chest 😂😭
Does he not know McDonald’s sells gift cards
Cg
Who was watching this series from the beginning he was at 5 million now he is at 9 million my boy just climbed 4million subs damn
These people leaving no tip on doordash need to be dealt with smh...
Yours and haileys videos back to back make my entire day. i love you guys 🤍🤍🤍🌞🙏🔥
Low key I don’t want this series to end
7:03

Um
I don't wanna wait for 30th video, cause this guy is very cool.
This guys work ethic! Lol
Ayo, Uranus.
Love this series. So wholesome
you survived but is that a living
For a second I thought he said “Dolphin in the room” instead of “elephant in the room” and had to backtrack cause of confusion
What happened to Paul dodds donation
Uranus gang 💪
When you think about it, Ryan hasn't watched tv in a while so thats why he didn't know about the smart water acoline
Who else watches 1 of these every night
turdboi420 should be constantly listed as #69, please and thank you
What happened to the top donor who donated $50,000 and then $100,000?
Such good energy! Loving your positive attitude and how you keep going from strength to strength. You take setbacks and resets so well, and you keep grinding and pushing forward while looking on the bright side of things. Love your humour too, and how you sing 'I got a feeling' every now and again. Very amusing. Also thought of you when I made burritos at home last week, haha. Honestly so inspired by this series and wishing you the very best!
i dont got much money, but ill try get 10 dollars in thr last 4 days then donate to u
I I love your videos
Just passed 9 mil! Really enjoying the series so far! Keep up the great work Ryan! (my name is Ryan too)

To be in his video... Lol!
Ayooo armpit check 18:34
Day 18 cuts to day 20 at the end of the video!
him just constantly getting chipotle makes me anxious and disgusted
Let’s go grossi possi
the worst vegetable is definitely asparagus
8 times in 3 days
Let’s go get some grub hypothetically
jupiter is ADORABLE
11:15 actually had me intrigued for a second...
Omg he has 9m subs and I've been watching him since less than one mil
Ryan :gosh I did not see those people there .the over 4mil people that watched this :😐😐😬🙄😐
Hey, I'm confused. Shouldn't you have been resetet, after the 100k donation?
What does he do with the money that gets reset?
Wierd question but where do you 💩
You should of put your bike at the gym
Dogs chasing after a squirrel is an American thing in my country we have no squirrels
my guy is growing like CRAZY!!!
The big ants got me lol 😂
This is my daily schedule watch Ryan then do stuff
Go to Walmart and get a debit Visa card from the gift card section

9:54 damn, he has an iphone 13 and he just got to know abt the cinematic
“Have you seen Moana??? It’s a great movie…”  -Ryan 2022
It is easy to know that Ryan always drinks an iced coffee in the morning
I can’t believe that Ryan has gained a million subscribers from when he started this series.
Sht....whaddup Kat? 😎😎
Survey profit doesn't come from the penny...
Howdy
What happened to Paul dobbs like he’s not on the board anymore
Isaiah passed the rock🪨 in subscribers
We love Jupiter 🫶🫶🫶
Why isn’t Paul Dodds at the end on the donation page?
Did dr Mike’s 100k not count for a Great reset???
bro you got reset
Im 3 days late but its still very good
ok thats deleteted
A legend named ryan trahan 🔥
11:37 as soon as he said it I thought Disney/Moana
SUIIIIII
As soon as your bought that lawnmower I felt awful I tried doing the same and got rejected by the entire town
Go Jupiter woo✊✊✊
4:18 the best thing he said in the whole challenge
I really want to see Ryan in North Carolina where I live, Isaiah phone entered the video crazy
Ellie and Chris Carpenter
All I want right now is America food. (I’m in Italy.)
Same people might say Ryan was “the  one who knocks”
bro i know im late butmy friends names are sun and my other friend is shiney
Holy smokes the big ant
ants!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! look away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes Moana!! And I love this series!!!!
How come you were not reset after Dr.  Mike donated $ 100,111?
it would have cost you $0 dollars to not sing, that's an investment.
18:12 babe why are you clutching the burrito like that I promise you it ain't going nowhere
what happened to paul dodds
You don’t know how important that bug warning was for me! Thank you! 🥰
No joke but he is actually a good singer.
Brandon is off one of them perc 30s those silly kids be doing now a days
What’s that survey app called
You should try 50% sweet tea and 50% lemonade
nice
What is the point 18:18
Shopify donated above 50k but no great reset?
Hi
Not trying to hate I love this series but if all profit must come from the penny why can he use the survey app
I’m so confused what happened to the guy who donated $150,000 he wasn’t on the list
How does Ryan eat cheese If he’s lactose intolerant
You should walk Spock just for fun on a day you aren’t rly busy
Jupiter gang.🐕
Am I the only one that loves Ryans character?
bro is gonna win the lottery and get reset
Paul Dodds left the donation page? What happened
cool
The ants lol
Hi Ryan
Wasn’t he reset someone gave 100k
Zucchini is the WORST
New title series: "I hustled my way across America for 30 days to fuel my McDonalds and Chipotle addiction" 🤣
Go Jupiter gang
Jupiter gang
He betrayed spork
plot twist: at day 29 ryan's evil twin nayr appears and takes all the money from feeding america
I already subscribe and he still has 9.09M subscribers
Your interview questions were so fun😅
What happened to Paul Dodds donations?
I just unsubed and resubed. I don’t know if it works  like that but whatever.
Yo what happened to the great reset last night like what
Jupiter gang 💪
Pennys are not going extinct btw it was said by a Mint US official that pennys aren't going anywhere
You didn’t reset after the doctors $100k?

copyright
18:14 ASPARAGUS IS THE BEST 🤨
Hey I am Maui in play and that made me laugh so hard
turdboi420 65th donator
6:53 man got some ticc arms🦍
You can use an app to store your money :) like current and idk or maybe there is a way you can be safe from the great reset .
Im actually kinda mad you are wasting the giftcard while you have 100 dollars, I want to see what are you going to do if you get reset and the gift card runs out...it will be quite funny(and stupid XD).   btw im writing this at minutes 15 so idk if you got reset.
Honestly, I wish I had his view of the world, it’s so fun and positive and wholesome.
13:21 "Yeah"
Where does Ryan charge his phone?
" Bro, look at these ants there HuGe man!"  turns out there are just play ants, you had me on that one!😅🐜🐜
Lol, another math mistake, at 14:46 when you order the burrito the money does not go down
11:36 That’s exactly what I was thinking
you should invest in a bike lock just in case
MY DOGS NAME IS JUPITER
buy a visa gift card

The ants in Australia is crazy
Ryan! Does delivering food and earning money through them break the rules that every money must come from the penny??
Me watching him cut the grass as a grass cutter this hurts my eyes LMAO, he literally KILLED the grass no hate but  next time to know, he needs to put the setting up so the grass is not killed and make should to go in one duration so the lines look the same loll
I like he’s like the dogs been just looking forward and walking as if he was so posed to walk backwards
who's been here even before the series started
Where is Paul dodds
Ryan where did Paul does donation go I did not see it at the end of the video
Yaaaay

Jupiter is out of this world!
Ryan:Describe me in one word. Me:Awkward "If you know you know"

I'm just wondering, what happened to Paul Dodds, he isn't there in the top donations for a while.
11:35 i'm dying😭😭😭😭😭
EAT YOUR VEGGIES!      🥬🍌🍎          is what Ryan should get out of the 4 options of tattoos.
Oh my... $7!? You can get that for $2 here in the Philippines. The difference of pricing depending on the continent. Sheesh.
De-aged Dennis Pennis
Got an idea walk dogs while your doing Uber eats or doordash
three fifths of the way there
Isn't using the card when you have money kind of cheating though?
What is the name of the survey app?
you need an uber eats sponsorship cuz im about to sign up
Really don’t understand how some of these people are only tipping $1 for a delivery? Like don’t order delivery if you can’t afford to tip?
What happened to Paul Dodds?
Don’t understand how you keep eating all your meals with no drink and then you pay for a drink by itself when you can just ask for a cup of water lol
What's the survey app you use?
DONT READ MY NAME
Should have brought water to sell at blues on the green lol
Spock watching this: am i gone in his life
8:15 Ryan is holding that burrito like it’s aboutta run away 😂
DOCTOR MIKE 👀
4:06 is that first gen rx7? how cool the owner is
Now i’m curious about what his go-to burrito tastes like
Where  do you pop
Who says it has to end, you could do a part 2 for a different charity
I have been watching mrbeast 4years now
MORE OF THESE!
broccoli is underrated
A oo
is it just me or does the chipotle prices increase everytime he visists it
19:20 +1.5 subs (1.1 more than usual😂😂😂)
Howdy Ryan, I was wondering that if you shouted me out on one of your vids, I will do the penny challenge in the UK, which is a very hard thing to do. Let me know if I can do it
ryan. i just relized ive been watching you since you were like 17-18 dude. that's 4-5 years
Buy ☀️ sunscreen 🧴!
i like how the dude at 13:58 was like alright now GIVE IT BACK
I think Ryan's sanity is on all time low.
How didn’t Mike reset him with 100,000
Too easy army!!!
Why does it look like Ryan was going to accidentally kiss him lol 17:53
Ryan: finally finishes the series and comes home  Spoke: looking at him like 👁👄👁    Edit:Spoke is his dog
Ryan I love you but you have clearly never mowed a lawn all the lines are supposed to go one direction.
bru ur my idle
“Bro is another species”
This series really boosted Ryans popularity and I'm happy for him
High Ryan I just subscribed you with 3 IDs of mine. Great Job Buddy

I love this series but I feel like Ryan could make a spinoff video called "What eating McDonalds for a month does to your body." 😂
What is the app called for walking dogs
HOW THE HECK IS HE CHARGING HIS PHONE
What happened to Paul Dodds on top donation leader board
Grossi possi is taking over
Which gymshark shorts are you wearing? And length?
I feel like you going across America with a penny should be in the history book
11:20 bro I freaked majorly. THEYRE HUGE
You should put your money on a visa gift cards so if you get reset you’ll have the gift cards
At the end when he’s munching on the burrito rapidly, interviewing people, and saying “woo! I’m so crazy.” Reminds me of the joker scene where he licks his lips and drives a stolen police car in Gotham while sticking his head out the window 😂😂
What is the Apps Name In which he Walks Dogs?
Anybody else doing the surveys😭
you should get a water bottle
what survey app does he use?
Tom Grossi the goat
Ur almost at 10 million subs!😃
currently watching this while eating a burrito from chipotle
you will get more houses if you do $15 insted of $20
Love the series but where does the money go when the GREAT RESET happens? keep it up 😊
Oh he used the mulcher
guy at 17:42 looks familiar. can anoyone tell me who im thinking of by chance?
can we all just agree that his soundtrack is lit
Bro is 4 feet tall💀💀💀
God bless🙏🏾
Getting there! Good luck! This is turning out to be a budget supersize me :P
I’m surprised no one has said this, McDonald’s should sponsor him
Didn’t the Doctor Who donated 100,111 dollars reset it ? It shoud have . He had $26 that night and never mentioned a reset? Maybe I’m missing something lol
Omg there are so many bots in the comments
Yas queen slay kill them demons

Please someone donate a green smoothie to this man he needs a vegetable
Still no sunscreen in the morning routine 😭
when tonight wasn’t a good night 😰
dude, i see your Beard
I love Jupiter so much
Lol wasn’t expecting the ants
You should buy 10  1$ scratch off tickets so that you have a chance if you get reset
Whats the dog walking app?
20+20+10=90 percent where is the other 10 percent :o
I swear I’d I don’t see some lettuce or at least some dang tomatoes on that burrito i will quit watching the series
Ryan you make me feel better
Wow he got 1m sub in 19 Days W O W
i have the same lawnmower.

Fun Fact: this is the longest episode of his series, also basically all of the fun facts aren’t fun………
Oh my god they gave a tip to the camera guy this made my week

No way Tom grossi donated
Lets go Tommy!
those ants tho😳
Are we just going to ignore the fact that she said her name was Ireland
i think you should try the 5 dollar 20 piece at Mcdonalds,.  also you got this in the bag reset or not
I feel like one day Ryan’s just gonna go to  chipotle and say, « Can I get the regular »
I love Ryan’s singing omg.
Ryan really be a chipotle regular now
What happened to mike dodds
Who else love Jupiter?Cause I sure do!
18:21 is this what its like to be an extrovert?
isaiah GOOFY bro
Those ants are huge
It would be a cool money making method if you go get cheap candy and when you go to the airport sell them for fast money. 🤑
No way someone didn't steal his bike in broad daylight, but when I leave a bike behind a building for 10 mins it gets stolen...smh
Jupiter gang 😎
BRUH HE GOT 200K SUBS I 1 DAY
Ryan you should make a bank account which you can put money which is safe from THE GREAT RESET
pot jupiter
Great game plan 👍😌
Your videos are great but you need to not eat so much McDonald’s
Where do u find such cheap plane tickets ?
hi  :)
Ron is proud of u dont worry!
bruh he got reset by the doctor and didnt reset bro
Here in Canada people care about their lawns so much so you can get a customer in two seconds
No shot bro said asparagus
“Bruh what kind of dog is that?”
huh where is your 5mil subs it changed to 9mil wtf??
You had the chance to get a rope and tie to the bike
gasppp   the FAIRY ODD RESET
i bet you those dirty dogs scanned the scratch tickets and then gave them to ryan
Lol whenever Ryan says I got a feeling I always think it's somebody's watching me
Gotta love “THE GREAT RESET” moments
Hey Ryan, if you get that breakfast again, put the hashbrown ON the sandwich. Trust me, it's AMAZING!
Bro isn’t this just life?
where does the reset money go
I looked away when he showed the ants cause I dont like bugs, how big were they actually?
I cant believe cinematic mode looks so good lol
I actually appreciate that bug warning so much, most YouTubers just show it and don’t give a second thought
Ryan is gonna have 10 mil subs by the end of this
The splits great reset has to be the best one yet lmaoooo
Why was only 10 dollars added to the counter after the guy gave him 20 dollars after he mowed the first lawn
His videos are literally part of my morning routine
1:07 lol i really thought he poked the straw into the mcdonalds bag
Does ryan not remember isaiah was one of the first to donate?
The fact he interviewed the exact guy that gave him 5k lol (isaiah photo)
Jupiter gang
Isaiah potato
Ryan, ik ur probably not going to see this but Spray painting house numbers/adresses on trghe sidewalk is an amazing money-making method this one dude in our neighborhood did it and i swear he got like 1k dollars!
Why isn’t Paul in the top donators for the outro?
“You guys seen Moana” 🤣🤣
17:43 *THE GREAT RESEH-*
Imagine for 500k it sends him back 2 states
Uber why don’t you do favor ?
900k meals??
brandon 4 sure doesnt sleep
“Unlocks cinematic mode” Wow! This is sick! “Goes to a random person who doesn’t give a  fuck” Dude look at cinematic mode. I just discovered that!
bro where is Paul Dodds
If someone donates 100k how come it doesn’t count towards the great reset?
I literally love Isaiah Photo! :P
17:30 wasn’t expecting Isaiah to come up
What happened to Paul dodds on the leader board
Okay but like Ryan literally deserves the  world i stg
*At* 17:54 *Ryan almost kissed that guy lol*
*From* 16:39 *To the end of the video Ryan got drunk he was all tipsy lol*
I'm sorry the ants made me dislike😅
Why didn’t he reset because if dr mike
I just found out that Ryan’s birthdays October 7 I share a birthday with him
Let’s Get that Goal Ryan!! 😁👍🏼
When he said there was huge ants I did not expect that 😂
jupiter is so cuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Why you dont reset with the 100,111$ from the Dr.?????
Ryan eating Macdonald’s and chipotle all day everyday *rides bike to deliver people food* (burns calories off) my calf’s are thanking me right now
Jupiter gang!
Where's Paul Dodd's donation?
Lets be honest ryan coudve make 100+ dollars selling things at the concert
wait so would it count as a great reset if i donated $49,999 and then 1$ on the same day just as different donations?
i remember day one☝️
Oh my gosh there’s more of them the cities crazy 😂🤣😂🤣
i love the edit with Prestons money counter going up by $2.50 lol
man said “thank you” to “f@ck mrbeast”
For the bike always just take off the front tire and hide it.
What happened to Paul dodds Donation? Isn’t that more than Dr Mike
w jupiter
After 18 episodes of continues fast food, food delivery and the same music over and over again, I am starting to get trigerred..😐
Aaaa ohhhh Jupiter
i was very thirsty watching this
You can get an app to scan recipts and get pionts for gift cards
Never expected to see Grossi donate!
Bro when he said the moui line I literally finished it before he said it and I’m dying rn
This is literally my morning routine
I wonder what goes through jupiters mind when Ryan puts his camera down, and walks 20 feet back and walks forward again then goes back and pick up the camera with Jupiter
Chipotle or mc Donald’s should really sponsor Ryan
Didnt he get reset
ayo where'd paul dodds go
Check Randon's pulse bro
I love Tom grossi go pack gooo
Chipotle needs to make a Ryan Trahan special.
1:52

Download coin
:"alright guys, describe me in one word"  : Cute!
The survey isn’t giving surveys to my brother.

17:30 ISAIAH!
God is the best way to change the world
What happens to your money in the inventory when the great reset happens? where does it disappear off to? just curious :)
12:59 SO CUTEEEEEE
bro the music/speech sound balance is kinda whack. my sub fucking explodes(its not set very high) but your speech is way quieter for me
My guy has probably put on 50lbs in this series
the dog walks are the BEST PARTS of these episodes i love Jupiter so much
Where do you get the jobs?

Jupiter is so cute 😍

Ryan: “Jupiter’s a different species.” *Literally the next clip* Ryan: “The man wants to run!”
Uranus    .

100k isn't a reset???
Lol Shopify with the 69,420
what happened to that paul dodds guy? he is not in the list at the end anymore
Didn't you get reseted yesterday
You should go back to the lottery tickets that say  Your number : Winning number : Prize: I think it’s worth a try
Yo yo did this boi forget if it gets over 50,000  big mac's it's a restet (dramatic dance pose)
If a rule is all profits must come from the penny then why can he do surveys?
Just fyi, you only added $10 to your money counter when you got a 20 for the mowing. Great series!
Baby girl you could’ve saved like $1-3 through the discounts on the McDonald’s app… just take a second more before completing those transactions lol
I jump off my balcony when I saw The ants
Bro them ants scared me
5:24 “imma use my hands to get some of the big ones” well ok then
Broccoli and Asparagus are incredible vegetables
Ryan you can't just make dogs eat grass!!
"11:20" you got me so good 🤣🤣
Man he got some really shitty tips. Makes me sad!
great video
those were some big ants
Such noice facial hair
What can I say except your welcome😂
Anyone know the name of the app he's using? The one that pays you tell them what you ate
Do you know the Ten Commandments? Have you kept them? Have you lied? Have you stolen? Jesus says everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Have you looked at anyone with lust? He also says whoever murders is liable to judgement but everyone who is angry with his brother is liable to judgement. Have you ever been angry with someone? If you have broken any one of these you are guilty before God and are on the path to hell. But God did something for us guilty sinners so we wouldn’t have to go to hell. He sent Jesus to suffer die on the cross for us! Jesus lived a perfect life and took all of our sins upon himself on the cross and by Gods amazing grace and Jesus’s sacrifice we may live everlasting life with Him in heaven! We broke Gods law and Jesus paid the fine. Jesus’s last words on the cross were it is finished! The debt has been paid! All God commands us to do is repent, that means turn away from sin and trust in Jesus! God bless! All glory to God!
my friend wants you to walk her dog tomorrow! how?
I can describe mrbeast in two words-meanly generous
Hey Ryan when you are recording this it is my birthday and today for you was a good day and for me it was a good day so keep up the good work and get to North Carolina

Doctor Mike had activated the great reset on day 17
I'm offended by the burrito slap 😂
Ryan… chipotle gives water for free, just ask for a “water cup”
Wait a minute... Am I the only one noticing that the 150,000 dollar donation from that one dude is gone?
#****mrbeast
I've just realised. He totally hasn't showered has he
alkaline is a base not alcohol lol
Bruh I on moui
You got me with the ants haha
Ryan why dont you get a car for the 30 delivery quest, the car will be like 30+ dollars but ur still up!
Ryan has gotten 3 million subs in 19 Days!
Moana is called Viana now :/
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates..🟥
Moana is called Viana now :/
Damn, is shopify gonna sponsor Ryan Trahan or something lol.
1:47
The profit is supposed to come only from a penny isnt it cheating doing surveys?
You could get a credit card 💳 and store all your money in the end of the video??
4:07 IS THAT AN FB RX7?
Isaiah was in one of mr beasts video
Is it just me or did he not know  Isiah photo is the one who donated him 5k Maybe he did know he just didn't put it in the video idk
shouldnt he be reset from the 100,000 donation or does it have to be 50,000?
I tought you got reset yesterday
Congrats on 1,000,000 Raised!  keep up the good work
14:39 I say this all the time lmao

3:15 lol

turdboi420
I did not mean to dislike but keep going. Dont give up

I have a question: WHERE DO YOU CHARGE THE BATTERIES FOR CAMERA ?
Didn’t you have to reset
2.50 the camera man xD
What happened to Paul dodds donation
Why didn’t he get reset to 1 penny after the 100,000 donation?
What app is the survey one called
You know you should buy some sunblock.
Ryan i have an idea keep ordering until you reach 30 orders for another account
it is very cringy at 3:06
How does the great reset work cuz it’s illegal to destroy any money like does he give it to charity or something
I know the owner said to keep the leash there but next time dont, it can rub against him and hurt him
Nearly at 9mil
Ryan: Describe me in one word. Me: Short.
Why didn’t he get reset from dr Mike’s donation?
LOL my mind automatically went there when he said “what is the lesson, what is the takeaway”
sadly there is only one McDonalds open in Kyiv
At 17:00 my soul left my body
wait i thought if someone donates over 50,000 the great reset happens and last episode dr mike donated 100,111  someone please help me understand
What happened to Paul Dodds?
Bro is making history
Love from India ❤️❤️❤️ great work by you 💐💐💐
Bro, how it is not raining in ur videos?
whats the nae of the song in 19:47
Where did poul dods go???
Thanks to Ryan for this series! The YouTube algorithm recommended this, and I've never been so thankful. 🙏  I'm learning to practice gratitude in my own life and 'the great reset' just teaches us when you have a setback you can restart at 0.01.
you should buy yourself a 50$ mcdonalds gift card because you always eat mcdonalds and it will be money safe from the GREAT RESET!
That dude went from loving MrBeast to having beef with him in 5 seconds 🤣🤣🤣
When you get your chipotle you should order it with Uber eats and then pick it up yourself for just free money and progress on doing your 30 Uber eats orders
Why is Paul dodds not on the “top donations”? Give the guy credit.
1
I have been watching this from episode q
The part where he was talking about how big the mettle ants 🐜 were I laughed so hard it was just so funny🤣😝😜🤣🤣 😅😆😂😭😝
dog walking, surveys and uber eats shouldnt be allowed as that prophit does not come from the oenny, unless you buy a phone using prophits to do these
HOWDY🤠
I now

Every time he tests the taste of McDonald's coffee I nod my head 😅

Jupiter
What will happen if he shredded the camera?
If you don't want the series to end then do 30 days on 1 penny to get back home
Shouldn’t doctor mikes $100K cause a great reset?
I’m
Lookin good bae. Looking good.
The name of that serve app was?

The apology to your dad just shows how well you were raised . Love it🤘🏽
5:43 it only goes up $10 in stead $20 but 8:47 it goes up $30 instead $20 so like it still right  $10 from the $30 will be plus with 5:43 $10
16:21 women
What happens to the reset
Hi
What happened to Paul Dodds?
14:47 = chin
cinematic mode or blurry mode?
Didn’t dr mikes 100,111£ count as a great reset ?
I’m so happy bc I’ve been on vacation for 2 days and now I have 2 episodes to watch
e
Who is MrBeast?-🤓
i think that you hit 1m$ from you tube and feed america
Ive been subscribed since before 1 mil and now youve almost reached 10 mil
you should invest in sunblock
It ain't  right  bro I'm rooting for ya but at the same time you gotta  suffer  and have to make hard decisions and suffer at least some  regardless.  So with I had cheese to reset you  but as a person who has gone through a lot of shit . And I know you'd survive it but  1 🌙 night of wet weather  you'll be hatin life!! Might wanna think bout getting something to  keep you  dry . But it's almost summer you might get lucky. Vyt it would be more  entertainment to watch you freeze your ass off for a night! Lol
we are almost at 10 mill
yo brandon was fr tweaking
I remember him just passing 4 million jeez that's a lot of subs 9 million is I also remember him at 100k subs
i love u so much iv been here since day 1
Well that suck surveys on the go is not for Canadians..there goes that money making app for me
Keep it up!!!
69420 dollah
did u not get reset yesterday??
You didn’t great reset from the guy gifting 100,000? And you need to get tattoos
No you really didn’t get
I thought the profit only comes from the penny so how did the surveys count
I think so far he has been living off of like an coffee no hate tho i love his vids btw im gonna be devastaded when de series ends.
where are tatoos?
17:42 17:42 😭Bro this position💀
I didn’t expect that me will meet Isaiah photo
Need to invest in sunscreen for the inventory
Did he forget to reset cause I thought someone donated 100k
Im going down but the money is always going up
HEY RYAN, I JUST WANT TO TELL U I LOVE UR VIDEOS AND I ALSO WANTED TO GIVE U AN IDEA OF A MONEY MAKING METHOD. SO, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DO THIS AND IT CONSISTS OF SEARCHING FOR VALUABLE STUFF INSIDE TRASH CANS NEXT TO BIG SUPERMARKETS ETC, AND THEN U CAN SELL WHATEVER U FIND THERE. WISH U LUCK LIKE THIS COMMENT, SO RYAN CAN SEE THIS PLS
In this entire episode i blinked like 10 timer
dont u have to reset because of doctor mike?
Agree.      With all
I thought he got reset yesterday by doctor mike, or is it only if it’s exactly 50,000
Is it just me or is Brandon at 18:06 a ghost? No pigment in his skin at all.
What if the camera man starts his own adventure😂
Ryan-whats your name Eliza-Eliza Me-👁👄👁 SHE STOLE MY NAME!!
You been using McDonalds rewards app but not Chipotle’s?
"Jupiter Gang"!!!
Slap the borito 2 times
Imagine be so lazzy that you cant walk your dog XD
Question where's the bike after you took the lawnmower
I am in Guatemala and this is my morning routine
You didn't reset
whats the app name
I came here after knowing he got reset the next day. All those bucks went down the drain.😢
Also, Ik you aren’t promoting the survey app but it’s genuinely so cool
Let's get Ryan to 10 million by the end of this 30 day challenge!
My father only wears college tee shirts and whenever he gets asked if he went there he says yes -_-
Just want you to know I laughed at the Moana joke
For mowing his yard
Now that's cool of the man that did something nice for him
You said chipotle was the best part of your day but wasn’t walking Jupiter the best part of your day
What’s the next money making method walking cats
Every single time I hear Ryan singing I got a feeling I have sing along now, It's like an unwritten rule
But didn’t he have THE GREAT RESET by doctormike?
Ryan I have a question, when you get reset everytime, what do you do with the money after the reset?
SHOPIFY WITH THE 69420 LMAOOO
Bro u got a 20 but only 10 was couning up lmao
Did you slap that burrito?
18
GOD Loves you so much Amen 🙏.
I watched the other parts of this series on my TV and I couldn't like the vid :(
Best youtuber rn
The burrito slap is iconic at this time

Hi Ryan. I love the work you’re doing as you are inspiring great change for lots of people. You got this and never give up! You are always positive and outgoing towards others, so continue the great work. I also just wanted to say that yesterday I got a burrito from Chipotle, and you already know what I did: BURRITO SLAP! Again, keep up the amazing work and you got this!

Shopify nice donation (19:49:
I would say buy a pack of pens or something, and keep them for when you get reset, cuz u can sell them!💓
bro eliza and kat are both taller than ryan lol
This series is simply a masterclass in how to approach life despite adversity
Wait but doctor mike donated 100.000 which is over 50k so why no reset?!
Damn i just watched all 18 Episodes in 2 Days....
Did anyone notice that his money didn't go down when he bought from chipotle at the end?

How are you charing your phone lol
"Ew, your anus" - Ryan Trahan
0:00 hello amazing viewers
what happened to Paul Dodds, why isnt he on the end screen?
Dang Ryan should’ve done a health check before and then one after the challenge, I’m so curious about his condition after his diet, sun exposure and the pure exhaustion he must be feeling.  Amazing amount of work put into these vids!
you should mentioned it if u have a coperation with mc donalds...
OMG EARLY AGAINNNNNN
He kinda changes his accent when he talks to black people
Series is so good Ryan! Lives of broke bois, but you’re doing this for a good cause! Wishing you nothing but the best on this once in a lifetime journey!
wait. where did paul dodd's name go? its not in the donation names
isaiah was the one that activated the great reset in one of the days
this video was one of the best parts of my day becuse  im sick
Congrats on 9M!!
I’m not first I’m not last but when Ryan posts I click fast
Where tf is paul dods???
you’ve motivated me to do some side hustles I don’t have the most money but you’ve inspired me and showed me how action speak louder than words, uber delivery drops today and half of my earning I will donate to this amazing cause ✌🏻🔋
Yo that's ma guy @ishahphoto
I just wanted to say that Ryan is kinda cheating cause on episode one rule 1: all profit must come from the penny  Ryan:using surveys

I live in Australia. Those ants are but a mere scratch. We live on ants the size of 27 whales here.
3:20, 5:29 Bro become a walking meme pt.2
Didn’t I see Ryan at 8.8m subs yesterday or is he earning 200k subs each video... I’m guessing he will have 11m subs when the series ends, if it’s true PIN THIS COMMENT!!!

The chat is glitched
Yup I was right 3:33 $20
this series is better than stranger things
actually sold it on the ants
Anyone know what happened to Paul Dodds?
When you cleaned windows you first took a look at who would been interested and you didnt this time. Just a reminder for possibke future method like these.😁Good luck 🤞

You can get a app you get 10 dollar a hour for walking idk what it is could but it could be good
why dont you put the hash brown on the muffin @Ryan Trahan
Something I'm curious about is what does Ryan do with the cash he has after each reset? I assume he just gives it someone he meets or something similar
At this rate he wont make it
Cinematic mode is all well and good until you wanna upload and edit it on a windows machine!
11:13 you got me
Ryan has gained 1m subscribers since this challenge that's crazy!
Question: What happens if you do not do it in exactly 30 days or what if you do it over 30 days
I almost LOST IT at “ayo Uranus” lol
Whats the survey app called?
If You Look To Page 3 and 4 Preston  and SB727 Donated 50K
Everyone makes mistakes
I’m salty happy
Suiiiiii 9 M
Ryan, if someone donates 110,000.00 I think you should have the major great reset and fly back to the last city… lol keep it up man, your daily ritual now haha
TURDBOI420
One of the best things about dude is that he never disappoints us with his content and he never takes credit for himself hats off to this guy who is a good guy and he never takes credit for himself hats off to this guy who is a good guy and

Our man changed the whole story of the world with 1 penny
Simple Australian here. Is there no law saying you have to use a helmet in America?
Man your almost at 10Mill and you deserve it
The next day GREAT RESET: allow me to introduce myself
What if he just failed to pay something due to a great reset and thus just turns into him running from the law, I would not complain

"chipotle is the best part of my day" jupiter: :(
You should have got a cooler, ice and beer and sold it to that crowd
Let try to make the great reset from subscribers
Hey! I've seen your videos, and i've noticed, that you like CHIPOTLE, For u i have a hack that you should try :D Order a Burrito bowl, and ask for 2 Tortillas on the side, that way you get 2 wraps, but pay for one. Try it :D
Lets try make the great reaet from subscribers
Maybe you should invest in a head sweat band
I'd love to see Ryan try to cross Australia starting with just 5 cents
Isn't onomatopoea the plural? So "slap" would be an onomatopoetica, right?
I love u bro

Ryan invest in a bike lock so you can ensure that safe feeling if you know what I mean
Morning
Where did Paul dodds go? He refund his donation?
juno first than jupiter, interesting how there both named the same as gods
naharT nayR
What is a hasta Brown? Or from what is it made
BUY A VISA or WALMART or DOLLAR STORE gift card
McDonalds or Chipotle should give Ryan a gift card
How come Paul Dodds isn’t on the leaderboard anymore? Did he take back the money. Gosh, I feel bad for Ryan is so.
This series should be titled “I survived on McDonald’s for 30 days”
I’m watching you at 1 AM and it is so enjoyable even though I am really tired
16:53 this guy is hilarious 😂
Go pack go!! Love you grossi
Ryan what happened to Paul Dodds donation can you clear up the issue
Oi
Day 3 of asking Ryan to rap his game plan
The Only Reason I Watch This Series is Just to Hear Him Say "Good Morning Sleepyheads" "Good Morning Sunshine"
You should buy a foldable bike to take on the plane
I laughed for 10 minutes when he isaiha potato
mans called a muffin a sandwich
This series is amazing but it makes me crave burritos and mcdonalds so much
Bro how is he charging his phone?
Shopify coming in with the 69 420 combo donation😄😄
OMG SKITTLE IM A BIG FAN I HOPE U DO. A VID ABT ZOOM

he gets great reseted on day 19
Got so scared to those ants
i hope when the series ends someone compiles all the clips where he says:   T H E  G R E A T  R E S E T  into one video :D
Did anyone else realised that Paul Dodds name just dissapeared from the chart at the end of the video?
Try going to churches they usually have fliers and they have McDonald's coupons
Bro this series is barely turning in to “super size me”
This series makes me want a better subscribe button to press it
I like this hard working guy!
DONT READ MY NAME
Omg I was watching yesterday evening and he had 8 million but I woke up and now he has 9million let’s get to ten mill
I love you Jupiter

Asparagus is one of the best vegetables how dare he
cut it out the part cuz hailey watching # 18:04
What app does he use in surveys?
I love the way he's so positive all the time and so determined let get him to 10 mil
Ryan la esta rompiendo con esta serie💯
04:33 did preston just become a god just to shoot that?!
in the cities you go to you should join a Facebook group and tell them where you’ll be and what you’ll be selling
bro i cant go any where before i watch the seires
wait so if he won the lottery but got great reset what does he do with the money 🤔
At 11:20 I AM POOING MY PANTS BECAUSE THEY ARE LARGE, LIKE RYAN SAID THEY ARE
Is it me or anybody realize that Ryan talked to another YouTuber that does challenges like his
4:17  remember when Chris says to peter its a familiar motion on lawn mower
Didn’t you get reset
How is nobody talking about the Moana reference... XD
He eats alot
I bet you would have made a killing if you stood by the neighborhood entrance with a sign for the mowing rather than going door to door. These days people just don't appreciate soliciting understandably.
who else was mildly infuriated by the leash being under Jupiter’s armpit 😫
Jupiter: **being a nice jupiter dog** Ryan: eyh.. Uranus
I just noticed that Brandon Farris donated and he’s my favorite YouTuber. Ryan is making a huge influence on the whole YouTube community and it’s for a really good cause! Keep up the amazing work if you can!
Tomorrow will be the great reset from Dylan
ryan discovering cinematic mode while shooting on iPhone is such a vibe
Hey Ryan where do you get the background music from?
Bro 17:08 this girl looks like the girl from  Surviving on 1 penny for a week Day 1 at 18:56, like actualy
Uranus 😂  Love your humour Ryan so proud of you too your doing amazing mate!  Love from oz
Crazy how Ryan is doing the penny challenge and the supersize me challenge at the same time
We should all notice how ryan puts his heart into every one of these videos. Go ryan!
RYAN BRO LOOK AT YOUR PHYSIQUE FROM THIS CHALLENGE
Next series I Survived on $0.01 for a year
HII I just want you to know you can get free water from Starbucks
The great reset is a good idea
Bruv
where did paul dodds 150k go?
Jupiter or Toro? Answer in comments
Let’s get Ryan to 10 mil subs before the end of this challenge y’all we can do it
If you need a pitch for door knocking let me know, I got you!
Fun fact weeds can be eaten . They even started selling in the store
At 14:15 u was hilarious
Congratulations for 9 million subs
I work at that shake shack on south Lamar😂
it’s crazy how little people tip food deliverers. A little sad tbh. 🫠
The change in his voice when he talked to Jupiter is so funny .
Y'all realize that a penny (0.01) for every subscription is not $100,000 for a million. It's $10,000.
BRUH you got 2 MILLOIN SUBBS by this you gotta keep going even if you have  a great reset everyday !!
#$&%@mrbeast 😇😇
Ryan buy 2 minute noodles and use a kettle at the gym if it has one
This is me Daily serie i dont want an end😫
He really should do a burrito slap transition!
i really love the series! im in a middle east country so these videos come at 8:00 pm for me so these are a part of my night/morning routine...like chipotle's the best part of your day, this is the best part of mine......Good Luck! and Bon Voyage!!
I’m so sad today because my scooter got stolen
Ryan! Wear sunscreen!
Jupiter Gang!
Umm what happened to Paul dodds donation?
I have a question if you subscribe and unsubscribe over and over again do u get more meals and do more people get fed
is it only me or like what happened to paul dods he isnt on the top donations list.
who tf donate 69420 💀
the ants eeeh
Ryan keep up the amazing work you make so many peoples day can’t wait till you get to 10 mill
So bothered by jupiter’s leash under his leg! Haha
9m subs congratulations
Last time I watched , u had less than 1 mil and now u have 9mil wtf u r a grinder
Paper beats rock
I love how the camera guy now has a money counter
Does anyone wonder that how Ryan even charges his phone while being out in the open doors?
Yo Ryan I've got a great idea you're on your mission to do 30 deliveries but how about you do 29 of the deliveries and when you get reseted you do the 30th one and then you have free $95 that's really smart idea
Initiate "THE GREAT RESET"
We love you Toro and Jupiter :)
Watching these videos has become part of my daily routine. I dont know what Im going to do on Day 31 🥲
he has ganed 1.5M subs in 18 days
Does anyone know why Paul Dodds' donation doesn't appear at the end of the video?
the coffee sound tho
Yo be careful because i heard that Tera Brite Games is going to activate the great reset!
pls use sunscreen im crying for ur skin

legend of this guy for even paying the camrea man, F in the replys to pay repects 5:38

What happened to Paul Dodds? The guy who did the first great reset and then paid another $100,000. His name is missing in the donation outro
Bro this episode was the most fun one yet
Does ryan use doordash to deliver his food?
invest in stocks to stop great reset!!!
If I had a nickel for every time Ryan Trahan said, “Let’s say hypothetically that tonight is gonna be a good night, that tonight is gonna be a good good night”, I would have two nickels, which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice.
Jesus died for you
I like how you can see Ryan's facial hair getting thicker
Shouldave gone to the taco truck for food instead of chipotle
ISAIAH PHOTO
RYAN SAY “GO TIGAS”

Ryan doing hardwork Le comments: "dont read my name"

Hey quick suggestions make a sign saying I bet you 1$ I will make u cringe  Cuz in the make you laugh was making them cringe
First of all, you’re cool, I’ll admit. Second, way to go chap. And finally, most importantly, I dare you to eat at Qdoba. WOAAAAAAH I know. Not trying to start a world war or anything, but I think it’d be good for you’re health. Have a lovely lovely day Ryan :) (smiley face)
Yooooooooooo!! 9M!!!
Wake up and say good morning saucy peanuts

9 MILLION!! Nice!!
Hey Ryan I mow lawns and I'm 15 and a lot of people say now but I mow 5 clients a week but u can't quit

Dog: *Exists* Ryan: You are the best creature to ever exist
God loves u have a great day
17:27
Jupiter is looking mighty fine with his bow tie...
Shopify has turned on the GREAT RESET! he will be at one penny in 2 more episodes
Hailey and spok: just watching this Spok: I'm not being replaced Sorry if I spelt hailey name 😅 wrong
I just VERY SURPRISED aT THe FACT MY FAVORITE YOUTUBERS DONATED TO U(u r also one of my fav YouTubers:) )
My favourite part 3:20
shopify donation lmao
Bro you’re using plastic bottles and destroying our planet. I was thinking about unsubscribing but then I thought of the lives I wouldn’t save. And now I feel my initial thoughts are not on par with the change you are trying to bring to the world. God bless your kind soul ❤️
GG BRO
Jupiter at the vet be like: Doctor: ok jupiter, so i will have to go into uranus for this operation.
9 mil Letsssss goooo
why is no one talking about how Shopify donated $69,420😂
love the videos and the the work you are doing to help people in need.  next time put the hash brown in the sandwich, its amazing.
Above the money counter you should do voucher counter
I love these vids how lucky for it to be playing on my birthday
I had no idea Ryan could sing
NGL, you don't have to accept every uber eats order Ryan. Im seeing $1 and $0 tips on your orders. Cherry pick man!
The Great Reset!!!
ryan just went to a whopping 7 million subscribers to 9 million subscribers, IN JUST 3 DAYS! Wow!
I honestly feel like like leaving the food on the door someone else can just come and take the food
Didnt he get reset last night?
I am absolutely loving an upload a day
How is nobody talking about that Shopify donation
that's sick that tom donated!!
This guy's eating habbits are terrible 🤣😄
Alkaline is a series of metals on the periodic table. Just had the feeling to put that out there.
I think you should be on the street begging for money, I will make you money
where's paul dodds????
Didn’t he get reset in the last episode by doctor mike ?
If you put your thumb over the top of the straw when you put it in the vanilla iced coffee it will go in first try (increases air pressure inside the straw, think of it like an inflated tire is rigid vs a deflated tire).
Didn’t he get reset in the last episode ?
Anyone know the song that plays at the hammock time
Anybody else think he should do "I survive on $0.01 for 30 days with my girlfriend"?
:D
💞
Ryan after the large vanilla iced coffee: 🤪
is money making in usa this easy really??he makes more money in a day than most in my country.
Dang! Shopify made a donation! They were also the leading donors for Mr. Beasts Planting Tree Fundraiser.
When the guy said he hates broccoli I was like WHAT BROCCOLI IS SO GOOD ESPECIALLY WITH MELTED  BUTERR AND STEAK 🤤
I am moving across the USA via roadtrip and this is helping me get over being sad about moving. Love your vids Ryan!
Can some one do a count of How much money he has spent on food and how much he have made it total
Mam reached 9m congrats
Where is Paul Dodds
Ayo-yo!! Why isn't Paul Dodds on the donations list anymore????
Toro is beeter
You should somehow get a bank account to store money in so its protected from THE GREAT RESET.
Can we just all be happy that he got Isaiah photo in this video one of the guys who donated to ryan 5000 dollars isaiah photo is a youtuber aswell and i was happy to see him
God bless god loves you
Ryan I think you should some aloe oil for sun burns because your face in the last clip was scorch red
13:20 lmfao I literally mentioned in a comment that this scenario would happen in the episode where you got the shirt lol
"I survived off $0.01 and ate nothing but vegetables for a week" please Ryan!! Eat more veggies
He’s gone up a million and a half subscribers in this series alone. Let’s get him to 10 million rn
Ayo 14:17
I bet the lawn mowing idea would work if you tried it later on a Saturday evening when more people are home.
Nice one Shopify
❤Happy Father's Day to your Dad Ryan brother and Love from India🇮🇳 😇
bro he had 8.82m yesterday he's at 9.02m today
OMG i have a dog named jupiter he’s a jack russel terrier and acts exactly like this jupiter i also had one named pluto
What happened to Paul dods?
i love this series
Does anyone know the Survey App Ryan has been using? I could really use extra income for my graduation tho. Thanks to who can tell me!❤️
day 18 of asking you to eat a single vegetable
It's just satisfying watching u mawn a lawn
Is no one talking about how much his fun drink was
I was just trynna watch Ryan trahan day 18 and then my mom came in and told me I couldn’t and took my computer. Like this comment so I can watch Ryan trahan again. Thanks y’all
Rayan your on top 34
Bruh Where do you charge your phone?!
were is pual and his $150,000 donation
10M SUBSCRIBERS PLS DO A GREAT RESET ON 10M SUB
WHAT HAPPENED TO PAUL DODDS??
Boring have to skip thru most of it
Congratulations Ryan for a Billion views on YouTube 🤩
I'm still confused about Paul Dodds-
Jupiter vs. torro. Well both of them are both cute so both win 🥰
🙂50.000$🤫
ryan you are responsible for half of chipotle and mcdonalds income
what happened to paul dodds?? his dono is gone-
Eat something else
Am i the only one wonder what phone he was using? 😂
Brandon needs sleep
I’ve been watching this series since day 1 and somehow I didn’t realize I wasn’t subbed but I just subbed
So did the doctor not reset him?
we have a giant shed filled with LSU fan gear mike the tiger is awesome when I went to a LSU game and I saw him he was huge and I love your vids
Why is the inserted sound effect of him sipping his coffee so satisfying
Chipotle and McDonald’s should at least donate cuz Ryan is literally promoting them as hard as possible 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Thank you for the chipotle today Ryan!
Beans
Commenting on every video I see challenge
Super big ants
Man those are some big ants 😳😳😳
Asparagus is my favorite vegetable
Also I subbed
I honestly feel like everything Ryan does on his phone is kinda cheating because the phone did not come from profit from the penny. Nevertheless, I am loving this series so far and will be quite sad when it ends..
3:25 Man clipped Ryan 😂
Dear god don’t go to Memphis for your own well being
I am so proud of you Ryan! You are a good man.
This series is literally the best thing on YouTube right now.
I though you got reset how do you still have 26$
You should try renting a u haul for door dash they are like 15 bucks
I am not sure this will work but you can buy a mini safe and store your money in it so you dont lose it from THE GREAT RESET.
Jurenus gang
where my Jupiter gang at?
Yuy
Jupiter
Lets Feed America 🇺🇸💵!
We love youuu!!!!!!!!
According to my math he is doing day 21 right now, so he is always going to be 3 days ahead of us. Thoughts???
I love your videos and watch them everyday. You are one of the best YouTubers, keep up the great work!
Go tigers!
Hey man try spray painting people numbers on ther curbs can make a good buck from it 👍 😉
SHORT KING
Ryan do car cleaning you only need a hose and a sponge for $25
Jupiter Gang
These videos upload at 2am for me but I'm up for all of them i never miss them love them
I got the three pointer he usually gets and it’s actually very good
Why was Dr. Mikes donation not considered a great reset? It was $100,000 which is more than $50,000
Some of these tips on the food delivery are just straight up embarrassing. If you can't afford to tip your delivery person stop ordering delivery! Plain and simple! $0 and $1 tips on fat orders is just rude
What happened to PAUL DODDS's donation
I really hope someone doesn't do...The Great Reset!
How does he charge his devices
nice donation shopify
18
Describe me in one word
Congrats on 9 million subscribers 🎉
F I F T Y  T H O U S A N D  D O L L A R $ donation is probably going to happen soon.
Let’s just take a moment to realise that Ryan is going to look like a different man at the end of this with all his new tattoos
Hey Ryan my lil brother Jose watches your series every morning his birthday is this month on the 28th could you maybe say happy birthday to him on his birth day please
.
ryan u make my day i love waking up and clicking on these videos. It will be sad when day 30 comes :(
TOMMMMMM PACKER NATION
Ryan you should get a debit card so you can be protected from the great reset
it say's your thing day 19
Jus a sec are we going to adress the whole survey for money thing? I thought all profit was supposed to come from the penny.
He didt go down money even tho there was a reset
Wait a second where did that guy who donated 150K go???
Spock watching Ryan walking Jupiter and other dogs: "So I've been betrayed"
hi
You literally earned like 3 millions subs from this series, its actually really interesting!
Let’s get you to 10 mil!
I’ve been watching Tom grossi for like 2 years he is so funny
hey ryhan when are you going to do a beard cheak?
Ryan: describe me in one word   Me: hmmm awkward or selfless
Don't reset
I thought he get reset yesterday why his money didn't reset?
GROSSI POSSI
GO TIGERS!!!!!
You need to just keep doing Uber eats to make your money you have made the most doing Uber eats
Sir how did you make a million dollars? Ryan: I mowed lawns.
These videos are just apart of my daily routine at this point
Bro him being in his hammock is ligit the intro and outro of these videos
When the great reset happens does he donate the money that gets reset?
Brodie is w rizz
I feel like Ryan is teaching people how to work hard and be positive. Also, iced coffee orders have increased 30% across America. Next series should be: I ate fruits and vegetables only for a week. Just sayin…………🤦🏼‍♀️
Is this series sponsored by McDonald's because he's been eating it every day
what happened to Paul Dotts
what happened to paul dodds donation of $150,000?
Wen u do door dash deliver service don’t leave the bag on the floor and you will get tipped more
What about Paul Dodds
Hey you don’t haft to but you should try doing walking dogs and doing delivery’s
next ryan is gonna turn $0.01 into an annual sallery by applying for a job
I sang the climb at school for assemblY and it was so fun
Hi
You said every profit must come from the penny but you’re using survey to get money which does not use the profit from the penny
Yayyy! You hit 9 million subs ! 😁😁😁😁 Congrats 🥳
What in Biden’s economy 2022 would you buy for 1 cent 😆 just curious
wait a minute PAUL DODDS IS NOT ON THE ROSTER paul dodds should be in first because he donated a total of 150,000 while the doctor mike in first place only donated 100,111 even though these are generous donations from generous people im just saying dont exclude paul from the fun
This is the best episode, lots of fun happen in this episode. Thanks Ryan
Man the ants were TERRIFYING. I totally agree with you.
thats the most entertaining lawn mowing ever
65th donator ?
I watched him hit 8mil 2 weeks ago and he just hit 9mil keep going Ryan your actually crazy!
me when ryan says he sees the biggest ants😮me after he shows the ants😮
Bro it was so annoying when the lead went under Jupiter's armpit.
Me: Checks in another day for vid Ryan: *9.01 million subs*  You got this bro, deserve every follow and view!
4:08 peep the 1st gen rx-7 tho 👀
Noice
How does he charge his phone
Half way there
I hope he goes to Georgia next
So we watching a uber driver for 30 days
The next drink you should try is a bambino it is Sprite with blue Powerade
Yo today is my bday and you made my day thanks
Today, I tried doing UberEats in my town just to see what it's like (I don't have a car so I'm biking like Ryan). I completed a single order, and let me tell you: It was the hardest-earned $3.50 I've ever gotten in my life.   Some lessons I learned:  1. ask for a bag when you get their order. I had to awkwardly carry this box of cookies while simultaneously gripping my handlebar (terrible). This will also protect from weather conditions (I, like Ryan, am biking 100 degree+ heat [the cookies were melting 😢])  2. Doing Uber Eats on bikes sucks in hilly towns (for obvious reasons).  3. Figure out if the roads are bike friendly or not. I had to bike along highways and bridges, and it was hella dangerous and not fun at all. 4. Stay hydrated (I didn't bring a water bottle, and I nearly died) (seriously though stay hydrated). 5. Really asses if a trip is worth it. Round trip I ended up biking 11 miles - I'm not joking. It was miserable.   In conclusion, Ryan makes this look easy 😅. I have newfound respect for him...
eyy happy 9M subscriber road to 10M
why isnt paul dodds on the donator list anymore?
McDonalds should collab with Ryan with a breakfast meal💀 at least 2 million people would buy it
Inspired to adventure by you and Lord of the Rings which I’m reading right now, I decided to take a spontaneous adventure this evening and now I’m sleeping in my car 3 hours from home and 5 from my destination. I didn’t realize how on guard you must feel every night out in a hammock in some random place. I feel like I shouldn’t be here but I’m pretty sure I’m allowed to be as it’s a rest stop. Anyway, keep up the good work! Good luck tomorrow!
Us down here in Louisiana appreciate the LSU shirt 😂
Ryan if u finish this series early u should try to get 500 dollars or make goals after u finish it in case there’s not a million raised or 2 mill
I love the dog walking!
It’s tough looking at the donations to see a great reset 😂😂
GREAT...
bro really needs to invest in some sunscreen
Dang my man just hit 9 mil. I’m so proud of you everyday I’ve been watching you during this 30 day challenge I’ve watched you climb from 8mil to 9mil. I hope you come to Mississippi and I see you
Paul Dodds controversy…
You should get a bike lock so that no one steals your bike
Where did Paul dodds go? Wasn’t he the top donor
Ayo, uranus.
I thought you got reset yesterday?
At this point the next time he sees Spock  Spock is gonna pounce on him bruh
Ryan you know u can get free water at Starbucks
Ryan: describe me in one word  Me: short
Just get a credit card and put your money on it so THË GRËÄT RËSËT doesn't come
He should get a airlines gift card
15:27 Ryan can now officially say that he slapped a burrito at a blues on the green
does anyone know what happened to paul dodds donations?
Can u walk a cat?
If you sold waters at that festival thing, you would have made so much money!
MC Donald's got stonks thanks to ryan
You’re not gonna lie next time try the hash brown on the sandwich
U motivate me so much I watch this everyday it's literally in my daily routine I love this so much and I love u
And you are 30 percent Chipotle
why did you replace the chipotle musiccc ;<
When r u coming to Chicago
He makes America look soo safe most the things he does in every state you can’t do in almost most of the uk
Ryan can your next challenge be you have to reach 1000 money and start of with  0.00 money
Ryan has legit been teaching us so many ways to get money! American youth pay attention!
WHAT HAPPEND TO PAUL DOODS ITS NOT THERE ANYMKRE
What happened to Paul dodds?
8 million meals in 18 days wow that's amazing
the time lapse of eating is the best 👌
U added $30.20 instead of $20.20 for the survey I see what your doing Ryan😕
Hate to me that guy but does anyone have a link or title to the music at 0:39? its really catchy
The Uranus part had me dead🤣
How come every time he gets chipotle makes me want chipotle
NEVERGIV3UP
I liked it when u stuck in that Moana line😂
@Ryan Trahan what if you buy a piggybank as a part of your inventory and put all your money into it? your safe from the great reset
Hey I was umm having a really hard day! But I just wanted to let you know your video really cheered me up so thank you!
Ryan u got sunburned man
Know how McDonald's does the celeb meals ? They should do one for Ryan 2 mchickens no lettuce and a large vanilla iced coffe
you should have set up houses in advance for the lawn mowing like you did with the window washing early on
no more singing plz
Bruh!!! I am sad cause what would I do after this series ends I am addicted to this! love you series ryan I highly appreciate your work 😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
yooo
I was looking at the big red ant looking for ants on it😬
fr
But you said youcan only get your money from your penny so the app for the ten dollars doesn’t count
You can tell much has decomposed over the videos
Woooo i donated a penny
Do great reset
Tonight's going to be a Good GoOD nIgHT🌌
This man is a madlad
When the series started he had 7mil now he had 9m congrats man keep up the great work
I like how shopify just donates $69420.
1mil to 10
Ryan: All profit MUST come from the penny  Proceeds to use an iPhone to do Uber
where gone paul doods 150k?
LET'S GO BRANDON
How do you charge the phone 🧐
I think the surveys may count as non-penny profit
It would be crazy if someone donated 49,999
I love your videos and keep it up ok
where did the paul dodds donation go? been wondering since last episonde, it was 150k 🥶...
Asparagus
Congrats on 9 mil
@Ryan Trahan, how come Paul Dodd's name is not on the list anymore?
Where did Paul Dodds go? He is not on the Top Donations page.
Ryan pls save your cup from chipotle you can use it more than once
Just woke up and found out that ryan have 9mil subs
Can we just all agree that he never fails to disappoint us with his content💕
I watched the interview scene in slowest speed and it sounds so funny lol @mrbeast
@chipotle
20$ to mow lawns.  you're literally scamming yourself
Uber is just fetch quests
Ryan’s starting a war with mrbeast  “ he hates me” 😂 he donated  $50 000 dude!
Great videos but I am confused.Where is Paul Dods donations?
what a nice day
.                                                      .
Why doesn't Paul dods show at top donations
What happened to Paul dodds
I was really scared when he checked the donation cause I thought that he was gonna get reset 😂 man! I don't want him to lose all that money. Just let him get a plane ticket!!
11:39 And the tapestries here on my skin…
this guy is the goat
Visa gift card would make this really easy
Yesssir go tigers !!!!!!!!! 🐅
this is probably one of the best vlogs ever.
W series
Ryan needs to get some vegetables into his Chipotle burritos 🌯
Ryan is one of the best and most motivating youtuber I have ever seen. Please get him to 10 mil by the end of this series he deserves it so much 🙏 ❤️
I really enjoy that your videos aren’t scripted and when things go wrong, they simply go wrong. When the lawn mowing failed, something miraculous didn’t happen, you simply failed. But it’s good to see you put that in there by scripting some miracle. Because regardless of your failure you kept pushing forward and continued working to your goal.
Shopify coming in with that meme donation lol!
I'm not gonna lie, Ryan doesn't look bad with a beard.
Hey Ryan I think you should a 30 day challenge with hailey I think this would be so good and entertaining
At this point ryan is the super size me guy
WHAT RYAN IS UP TO 9MIL HE WAS A 7 AT THE BEGINING OF THIS SERIRES?!??!?!
WHAT HAPPENED TO PAUL DODDS????
What’s the music at 0:39?
I know his order now
What happened to Paul dobbs?
My to favorite YouTubers Tom Grossi and Ryan Trahan
Wait what if we just unsubscribe then subscribe over and over will they keep donating?
This is probably my favorite episode yet. Also, that lawn mowing music slaps, Ryan!
Your either gonna be addicted to MC Donalds  or never eat it again after this  😂
Where is Paul Dodds in the donations?
that's awesome he's gained that many more subs
Ryan: whats the worst vegteble Me: all
What if u buy something and return it when ur about to leave to another city it’s a good idea for preventing the great reset
Buy a planet fitness membership… they are open 24/7 and they have showers
didn’t he get reset?
epic interviews
Why isn’t Paul dodds on the donation list at the end anymore
Congratulations on 9 million Subscriber keep grinding Your doing great 👍

w ryan ;)
Finish 20 deliveries and you're in North Carolina.
Honestly love the montage music
I wish I can eat that much lol
Ayo the rocks nemesis! Isaiah potato!!!
Ryan I have an idea, buy a visa gift card so whatever amount of money you make, you just put it in a visa gift card so the money doesn’t go away if you don’t get reset
Anyone else not want him to get the direct nc plane ticket and instead go across more states lol
POV: the best part of the series is Ryan singing “I got a feeling, that tonight is gonna be a good night!“ 🤪🤍
why cant beggars on the street do this?
''my sweat is sweating''  - Ryan Trahan 2022
What happened to Paul Dodds
Ryan I’m just saying this imo I NEED MORE 30 day challenges I love this I am hooked 😂❤️
9m baby

My most favorite thing in the series are him eating Mcdonalds and drinking the coffee

Jupiter

Am I the only one that doesn't understand how he thought lawn mowing would make him  his most money like I bet you the dog walking wouldve made him more
That’s nice!
That’s elite prime content!THANK YOU:)
Wait wasn’t Paul dodds the top doner?
I think ryan might not be just lactoce intolorent but I think he also might be veggiephobic
You're making me go to McDonald's and buy a large ice coffee 🥲
Happy 9 mill
wheres pual ?
Congrats on 9 mil!
14:37 you passed a airpod case lol
Almost at 10m sub in just 19days
"Howdy"
Should I give the penny I found on the side of the road to feeding America?
Am I just mistaken or did Paul dodds' donation get missed. I think last time it showed $150 000 by Paul dodds.
We LOVE Jupiter and Toro
Rejected Mower Man
Did anyone else notice a lack of the guy that donated $150k at the end credit?
0:37 I thought that my screen cracked in the top left
It would be cool if you could show more of the process of u finding hospitality
What app he use to walk dogs?
yo ryan why you not at 1 penny to start the day my guy, yesterday Dr Mike went ham
😂😂
I AM GOING TO RESET YOU
4:40 the "uh-oh!" was soooooooo cute!
L Patrick asparaguses are gas
Ryan are doing a giveaway

Has anyone figured out what happened to Paul Dodd's donation?
I’ve been here since day one
Tx weather it's soooooo hot where I live its bean 100 degrees and more all week
Another good job Ryan we all be leave in you!
Where'd Paul Dodds donation go
gotta admit, the ants made me squirmy
Where are we going to go when this series ends???
18:01 my favorite part of the video lmao
man i love these videos more than anything but your chipotle order SCARES ME 😭
Ryan is literally teaching us how to make easy money as he does these videos.
Congratulations on 9M subscribers, your growing so fast. Im so proud of you and I really wish I could get that many subs (edit: hopefully you can come to Georgia and then I can meet you there :D)
Why is Paul dodds not the top Donor

Issah photo!
For lawn mowing jobs, you probably need to target a decent neighbourhood (fairly middleclass/upper middleclass), people with considerable sized lawns (like 1 acre), or elderly people... otherwise people would just do it themselves and wouldn't want to give away $20 for work they can easily do themselves. Would have been better to just ask for donations instead. It was a good idea but you just looked in the wrong neighbourhood.
Uranus 🤣🤣🤣
Is it weird that I've never had chipotle before?
AYO URANUS
its kind of sad how some people don't tip the people who delivers peoples food.
what happend to paul dodds

Don't know if anyone mentioned this earlier, but I think "I Got a Feeling" would make a great song for the end of the last episode. Thanks.
I don’t think you look nice with a beard btw no offence
Your content is insanely good
I hope Ryan gets to 10 million and who else does not want this series to end!

Why isn’t paul dodds a donator anymore?  -peace
Am I the only one who realized Paul Dodds with the $150,000 disappeared?
I predicted that he would do a lawn mower
Ryan really felt that song
Not me every time I eat a burrito slapping it!
Bro him going up to people with a burrito and aggressively eating it is like the funniest thing in the world
Sooooo, when he buys something it doesn't take away from his total?

You are so awkward in all the best ways. This show gives me daily hope for the world that the good people can beat out the awful ones that are out there....those giant ants were actors in Honey I Shrunk the Kids...seems they've fallen on hard times.
Didn’t you get reset yesterday?
Lol Idk if its just me...but I'm watching on a MacBook and when he says "jc" at minute 5:32, it activates my Siri and I was so confused for 5 minutes lol

Ryan your so motivational and awesome your the best thing that has happened to this country in a long time
If you go to Louisiana homie I’m coming meet you
Ummm guys has anyone noticed the Paul dodds (the absolute legend chad who donated $150,089) has been missing from the donations list in the past 2 videos? Does anyone know why?
You should make a video about all the work into this series and all the editing that went into it, i might be crazy but i think the people that made this series possible should be recognized too and I think that would be interesting.
What happend to paul dodds being top donator
Ryan, this is honestly a really fun series! It is fun to watch you find new methods to make money to travel across america. Its been really nice to unwind by watching your videos! Keep it up!
HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

OH SHOOT THE ANTS ARE BIG
ngl i was watching last episode and was like oh no not lawn mowing and also the thought of him having to fill it with gas as well
Just checked. If you walked from L.A all the way to South Carolina it would take approximately 33 days
Pretty happy that episode by episode where hearing the outro song a lot longer
I have that Hello mat in my dorm ☺️
Fun fact: Ryan rhymes with Lion (Maybe you can pet sit someone's lion for money making method...)

“Ik I’m a snap, but I ended up got a whole meal” that was a good line
By the time this series has ended, there will be so many donations to thank at the end of an episode that the entire end song will play all the way through.
Today we are going to Disney but I was just about to watch the vid I had to go

Because of you dude i wanna watch every next episode in McDonald's with ice vanilla coffee and chipotle burrito, but currently i have no open Mc's and dont have chipotle in my country at all😆

jupiter gang
Ryan i love your making money method my family love your videos

Those ants ain't got nothing on Australian ants
Eyo Uranus
YOU HIT 1 MIL SUBS!!! LETSGOOOOO
8:47 bro got 30 dollars?
would be funny if Mc Donalds donates 100k and make Ryan get a McDonalds Tattoo 😂, at this point, Mc Donalds is basically his kitchen
Wasn't that doctor mike guy suppose to activate the reset?
Alkaline water is a scam, it goes right into one of the most acidic places on the planet. Well it is alkaline so not really a scam, it just has no bonus health benefits.
Jupiters bow tie went crazy
i was disappointed with the ants...
Ryan: These ants are huge! Me from Australia: ahh that’s no ant that’s my pet spider!
Congrats on 9 mill subs
Ryan you have to make an investment on LOTTERY TICKETS you can win a lot of money
“I am with Jupiter how are ya (shakes head)😂

@Ryan Trahan Des Ryan not know he can just get a water cup from chipotle for free?
Can you spend money on an airline gift card or travel app gift card to protect yourself from the great reset?
imagine if somebody resets you when you want to buy a plane ticket :))))))))))))))
Ryan : singing tonight's gonna be a good night  Me: realizing I heard that song today in the radio

You gotta love this guy. But he should spend the money he has now on chipotle so he still has more in case of the GREAT RESET

9.01m subs while I watched this vlog 🙂💜        Soon, road to 10 m 🙂
15:52 my family thought i was gonna be a girl before i was born. They planned to name me Ireland
he has gained 1.6m subs in the last 18 days of this series damn
i love how Paul Dodds has been removed from the leader board
When u showed the server app and said it gained you 20 bucks the counter went up by 30 I think It was just a counting error but umm yea. Edit: LOL just read the pinned comment 😂
What happened to Paul Dodds I noticed he is not the top donor even tho he donated 150,000 dollars?
He didn’t take away his money when he bought Chipotle 😐.
The best series ON YOUTUBE     debatable
mcdonald and chipotle stocks are gonna be rlly  high after this
You should do a challenge of visiting all 50 states in 100 days using one penny
Shopify's Donation - 69,420  Me : Nice!
When the series started, he was at 7M subs, now he’s at 9M!
I know you didn’t just say “let’s go walk this bad boy” when your were about to walk a dog 😡
Ryan be getting the ladies during those interviews
Hasn’t he been eating off these videos use that money!
In the end it would be cool if you tallied up all the money that you made from start to finish minus spendings
Shoot literally last night (Philippines time) his subscriber count is like 8.57m something and now it's like 9.1m👀😮900k more ryan and you will get a diamond play button and we can almost reach $1m donation and it's because this series is the best. CONGRATS RYAN
Buy a penny board 🛹
I swear this guy is growing in subs Soo fast wth 🤣🤣💀
Could we get a total amount made at the end. maybe total made, total spent, and total lost to THE GREAT RESET.
It should be criminal how these people tip the people who deliver them food. I don't use uber eats or doordash unless I'm able to tip 9-20 dollars.
What happened to Paul Dodds
When will you get the tatoo
I’m pretty sure he started this series with about 7.8 million subs and today he hit 9 million!! So proud
Where is Paul Odds with 150k donated?
Am I the only one that now doesn’t see Paul Dodds on the donation list anymore
my guy went up 1000 subscribers while i was watching this video
What happened to Paul’s $150,000 donations?
Ryan had some drinks at that festival lol
19:48 Shopify Nice
“…I think he’s faking giving money to people”         *dun*
I have a question, 1 of the rules was all profit must come from the penny but the survey app is not from the penny?
what happen to paul dots donation
Longest penny episode this series>>>>> what a dub
Who’s gonna be sad when this series is over?
WHERE IN THE WORLD IS PAUL DODDS
At 18:20 the girl behind him just sorta vanishes bruh 💀
you to work for mcdonald's
Where do you go toilet
I think i missed something what happened to Paul Dobbs
We dont want the series to end. Do another 30 days back to LA with a penny. Like it if you also want another 30 days back to LA.
Shopify u guys are legendssss 69 420
When ur name be sunshine ☀️=  👁    👁      Um excuse me                                                                      🫦
Ryan’s on the way to his 10mil button after this.. let’s go bro, well deserved!
5:51 ROFLLLLL
Die Ryan get the bike back at the end 🤣
Jimmy finna reset you
Please make vids longer
Too easy army lets gooooooooooooooooooo
Ryan congrats on 9M!!!
Ryan buy a visa
Hey Ryan, the chipotle order was never subtracted from the total, I know it's probably annoying to see these sorts of comments when you have to make these vlogs daily for 30 days straight and I understand that there will be mistakes on the way. Make sure to take a long break after this is over!
NOOOO TOROOO BE CRYIN RN
Did no one else realize that Shopify donated $69,420?
That ONE guy who donated 69,420 just for the meme
Man should buy sunscreen
abc
Please do the lemonade stand idea
Bros gonna have 100 million by day 30
I have suggestion for you should at dusk start selling waters in the cooler that way we can get a lot of costumers and get that plain ticket
Congrats on 9 million!
I was so praying that you don't get reset today. Yay! I am sure you will get that plane ticket tomorrow.  You are very creative and hard working. Kudos to you!
where is paul dodds!!11
Buy airline miles so you can protect yourself from THE GREAT RESET
Buy like $50 worth of stuff at target on 100 gum packs  then return it when u get reset to get $20 back
When he finally discovers cine mode. 🤯 Though that he was using a iphone 11 or something haha
Am i the only one who noticed Paul Dodds’s name’s ain’t on the list?
ayo~ coffee boy is back~~
W Jupiter
what happened to paul dodds donations?
here's an item you you should get to be protected from THE GREAT RESET is a bike lock just in case
Ayo, it's funny how you getting like 50$ - 100$ a day which is higher than me getting in a year lmao
Ryan you might be able to save up  for a plane travel gift card if something like that exists so then you can save up easier
I actually mowed the lawn today and got $30. Ryan made a great choice
what happened to paul dods on the top donor board
Mcdonalds hash browns are the best
Great Reset coming in about 4 days:  SB737 $50,000 June 18, 2022 6:34 PM  to the incentive "THE GREAT RESET: i will start over at $0.01" I bet you prefer being on 1 penny anyway ;)  Preston and Brianna 🔥 $50,000 June 18, 2022 4:42 PM  to the incentive "THE GREAT RESET: i will start over at $0.01" Something encouraging ❤️
Hey, be careful walking peoples dogs in this heat and on the pavement/sidewalk to avoid burning there feet, other than that criticism love the videos and your charity. From Florida with love.
This series need to be remade once every year.
Congrats On 9 Million Subs!
Nine mill let’s go
TOM GROSSIE!!!!!!!!
Another great video:) keep up the great work hope you reach your goals good luck!!
Wasn't there a great reset when the doctor donates 100,111?
I don’t know what I’m gonna do when this series ends. My breakfasts will be so boring
I love ur vids man 🎉 happy wishes to u to get to mrbeast and ur so dunny well to me 😂
You could probably get a plastic water bottle for like 2 dollars at Walmart or something. That would save money on your chipotle gift card :)
Howdy!!! from Philippines!! The Climb - that's our graduation song!!!!!
Ryan good dog there
ANDREW DID NOT TIP 😑
The nod of approval everyday after the coffee sip is GOLD !!
what happened to paul dodds

Ehhh  Uranis 🤣🤣🤣😂
Bro I though Ryan just got great resented since someone donated 100,000 dollars?
The great reset pose was actually funny
Arkansas Next??
Ok but seriously what happened to Paul Dodds?!?
At this point we need to count how many times he has either drank the vanilla ice coffee, mc chicken sandwhich or the burrito
I feel like you should get a basket for the bike
One month ago you were at 6.5 million subs, now you are at 9 million. That’s crazy, keep it up Ryan❤️😇
you could’ve asked for 10 dollars considering how many people you asked maybe even 15
Ryan is an amazing person for many things, but last minute delivering Chipotle to Andrew for no tip, that's the one that's going to stick with me.
Blues on the Green was June 14-15, so that gives us an idea of what actual date he is on.
How does Ryan pay for things online
ryan makes this challenge looks so easy
Jupiter gangggg
at this point i am begging this man to buy a bottle of sunscreen
thought the gift card was for emergencies!
This guy started with 5m subs now hes 9m corgrats ryan keep up the good content

Where’s the dog walk…😐🥸😞🤥
Panera unlimited sip club would be an asset with all those fun drinks you’re getting. Check it out!
you should just honestly get a job at mc Donald's. they are always hiring and they pay a lot
Those ants are HUGE i almost got a heart attack
You going to Tennessee
Congrats on 9M subs
I have been watching your vids and OMG I’m amazed.
put the bike in the free gym so it doesnt get stolen
Let's get ryan to 10 million subscribers before this series comes to an end. Honestly, Ryan deserves this for all his hard work! It's so crazy to think how he has managed to actually raise almost 8 million meals in such a short period of time. Way to go Ryan!
THE GREAT RESET
Imagen if Ryan had to go all the way back too Los Angeles every time the great reset was activated, that would be painful
Sorry I'm late but I'm still waiting for this video though I love you video Ryan <333♥
You should buy a scooter 🛵 it’s gonna be much easier for delivering
seeing in my first travel alone rn in midnight in the middle of the mediterranean sea. just awesome shared vibes

"Say hypothetically that tonight's going to be a good night, that tonight's going to be a good good night." 14:39 which episode did you say that in before? i got deja vu
Yo
Surely we see Mc Donalds hit you with the great reset.
This has become my favorite part of the day! I never saw any of your videos before this but your dedication and goofiness is what made me want to subscribe! Thanks for doing all of this to help people! It’s inspiring and makes me want to work harder so I can help others too.

i would love a series where ryan goes to events and interviews people with a chipotle burrito taking a bite after each interviewee.
Be careful this week brother. The spots your about to go through are seeing record heat this week. Pause this for a week if you need to don't die for content.
Keep using cinematic camera
You didn’t take the total off the food u bought bruv
bruh giga ants
Congrats On 9m Ryan!!!!
congrats on 9 mill!!!
Late
Ryan at the end of the 30 days you should rate all the McDonalds and Chipotle to see which state has the best food
Agua fresca means Fresh water   Who knew that
For the penny delivery, you and jimmy should do a 24 hours of you hunting him down video. Like with the bounty hubter
i just realized ryan is so lucky with the whether
Can we just talk about how awkward the interviews were 😭
Ryan should go for gambling and get some moneys on lottery tickets
Where is Paul dodds donation?

ur mic tapped into the radio what r u the irs lmao
He could of really mow my lawn but I’d paid him double the amount since 1 it’s been hot out for awhile so no one wanted to cut it 2 it was a bit overgrown, and 3 I have a pretty big backyard plus the front is average, but we also cut the the grass on the curbs and the grass on the side of our house and if he’d really did take off the weeds with his hands it’ll take him at 2 hours so 40 dollars plus a tip but it was 70 today so I cut the grass and my dad paid me
pfff i mow lawns and get 50 per

Ryan is giving a penny to the person that hates him
If you want to read the Gospel, then I will put something like that in my replies, but if you read that then you should still read the complete Gospel. If you read it then like the comment so that more people can see it, and more people have at least one opportunity, because accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior is the most important decision that you will ever make.
congrats in 9 millon
Congrats on 1 billion views
You can see his subs going up everyday because before the series he was on 8m and now he's at 9m
Get a bowl not a burrito they give you more.
Only 10 days left Ryan better speed up
Moana joke was funny 😆

17:42 that was the best "The Great Reset" xD
good job ryan keep up the good work
9mil subs alrdy
Whoever is reading this, I wanted to say I hope you have a great day and that God loves you so much that he sent his son, Jesus,  to die on a cross for your sins and he rose again from the dead three days later. God Bless! ✝️🙏🏼⛪️  And also, He doesn’t want you to go to Hell but he wants you to go to Heaven with him but you have to be Saved. How do I get Saved you might ask? Here are the steps below on how to get Saved!  1. Confess to Jesus that you are a sinner and ask forgiveness for your sins.  2. Believe that God sent His Son (Jesus) to die on a cross for your sins and that he rose again from the dead 3 days later.  3. Ask Jesus to come into your heart and your life and for him to be your Lord and Savior forever.  4. Build a Personal Relationship with Jesus by Praying and Reading the Bible daily and Live for Him Forever.  I’m Praying for you and you are loved!
What happened to the $100,111 where is the grate reset????? 😂
9 mill congrats Ryan!! 👏🥳👏🥳
Bro this man deserves a break like, fr-
congrats on 9 million
10:00 that cinematic mode is equivalent to portrait mode in android, it just blurs the background and highlights your face lol
Our Bro Ryan needs some sunscreen for that burnt face
you should put like 15 bucks in a prepaid card, so its protected from the great reset and it would be a little bit easier to get back on track after the great reset
why Tom grossi, why -bears fan
Ryan! when you are mowing without a bad, you need to keep that side flap up! when it's down and you have no bag, it clogs the blade and stops the motor from spinning
How are you charging your camera though - phoney don/ merchant/ Josh Craig/ 100 times
This is part om my morning routine.. I hope there's another series like this if this was ended..

What happened to the cooler and candy
Does anyone know why Paul Dodds seems to have been forgotten about and is no longer in the top donations at the end of the vids?
Wait what happened to the guy who donated 150k? It didn’t show him at the end of the video on the list
I don't know what it is but in this episode Ryan seems so happy and chill, I like it. The great reset doesn't phase him anymore, he is desensitized to it. Lmao....
Love
Hi

Loved this episode!
Hey Ryan I am from Pakistan and I love your videos literally u make my day love from Pakistan ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love
What happened to Paul dodds?

Wait if all profits must come from the penny, then how does dog walking work?
Ryan my mom and i start our day with this series
hi
There should be a ryan trahan meal at chipotle, with the chicken, rice, and cheese burrito w/ the "fun drink"
8:48 “earned $20” but budget went up by $30
Would it count to put your money in a bank and would it be protected from THE GREAT RESET???
What happened to Paul Dodds 150k donation? Vanished and Dr Mike got honoured as top slot 2 vids ago also.
What do you use to get dog walking requests
“1 Peter 4:8: Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.”
Put the hash brown on the  breakfast sandwich next time. GAME CHANGER!!!

You messed up the lines in the yard. Make them parallel. Cool vid
Bouta make 20 accounts and sub for more money

Where did Paul Dods donations go?
This series is really made me think about money and how I spend it. i’m sitting here looking at the floor in my bedroom and looking at all these coins scattered around that I never thought to pick up or use. It makes me think how fortunate I am  and how some people don’t even have enough money for one meal.    Ryan you are Broadcasting a very important message.  It is amazing and very inspirational you are doing amazing keep going much love and support to you and your team.
congrats on 9 million Ryan! 🥳

Did anyone realise that he talked to Isaiah flip and that guy was in mrbeast challenges
we love Jupiter lol (:
what happened to paul dodds? how come his 150k isn’t on the leaderboard?

"Put on my yellow shirt so I dont burn to a crisp" I feel like the next good investment would be sunscreen
Oof would’ve been a great time to get reset

Hi Ryan just wanted to ask u when The great reset is activated  where does the money go that u earned before the reset?
why isnt paul dodds in the donations
Chipotle should sponsor you. I saw you go today and it made me want a chicken, rice and cheese burrito. I'm typing this now with a belly full of Chipotle.
Ryan’s actually a good mower
W video like all ways Ryan

Let’s get my boy Ryan to ten mill before the end Of the series
When i saw how much shopify donated i started laughing
That coffee always looks great but I hate coffee.
Instead of buying Mc griddle‘s get a sausage biscuit and free grape jelly or strawberry jam! It’s cheaper and honestly slamm’n
When you said CINEMATIC on a phone it is called portrait and that is what it might actually be I’m not sure
lol the speedcam of ryan mowing a lawn
Yo, Ryan. You should definitely get sour cream in the burrito and keep the cups to get free refills
Ryan! You forgot to put Paul Dodds on the Donations list at the end!
9m
does anyone know what survey app he uses?
Let’s say hypothetically I kidnap your family
*go tigers, I guess*
Ryan just go ahead and make money every day, it's so inspirational
Out of any series on youtube this is the only one I continuously Watch. I wish this would never end! Keep up the great work Ryan!
mcdonald’s does points on their app and they’re super easy to get and you can get a ton of free food from the points !!

Yall is it just me who thinks this episode is the most fun?
Ryan looks like a zombie as the series goes on.. 🤣
how do you have plastic straws??? I swear those things went extinct like 2 years ago

Well done for 9mil
More doogs   . Lets gooooo
Did he just completely ignore the great reaet from doctor mike
That’s the same lawn mower as my dads one
DONT GRAB ME!!!
Do you know the Ten Commandments? Have you kept them? Have you lied? Have you stolen? Jesus says everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Have you looked at anyone with lust? He also says whoever murders is liable to judgement but everyone who is angry with his brother is liable to judgement. Have you ever been angry with someone? If you have broken any one of these you are guilty before God and are on the path to hell. But God did something for us guilty sinners so we wouldn’t have to go to hell. He sent Jesus to suffer die on the cross for us! Jesus lived a perfect life and took all of our sins upon himself on the cross and by Gods amazing grace and Jesus’s sacrifice we may live everlasting life with Him in heaven! We broke Gods law and Jesus paid the fine. Jesus’s last words on the cross were it is finished! The debt has been paid! All God commands us to do is repent, that means turn away from sin and trust in Jesus! God bless! All glory to God!
Ryan! pleasee come to arkansas!!!
9MIL
Ryan u should hire a car and lawn mower and I don’t know if u have a Bunnings like we do in Australia but If u have something even like that u could buy a edger for $5 then u could post up online that you will mow peoples lawn for like 20+ dollars depending on the size of the lawn
19 + 20 is 29 👌
Ryan is half McDonald’s lol
I’ve waited 7days to comment this but u know those suitcase scooters that’ll be a vehicle that you will be able to take from city to city also you get more storage

These videos always make me smile, especially when I see that people can be much more generous and compassionate than I thought, it really brings my faith in humanity up a little
In high school, a friend of mine and I gave compliments to people for a dollar. After about an hour, we ended up with enough money to get some Chinese food. You have better charisma than we did, so you would probably do better than us.
Will you go through san antonio?

I find myself greeting strangers with “howdy” now. Thanks Ryan

Do you tell the people who’s dogs you’re walking that they’re practically YouTube famous?
CONGATS ON 9 MILLION SUBS
Did any german told you yet, drinking iced water on hot days is actually bad for your health? You´re gonna swet even more, when you have iced drinks on those weather conditions, that´s biology 1.0 and also related to physics. Your body is going to think "I´m overheating" when you try to artifically cool it down like that. Ever wonderd why north africans aren´t drinking cold water but hot bewarages when it´s getting really hot? 7-9°C is the coldest you should drink on hot days, still very refreshing but not such a shock for the body as 0°C or below.
You should get one of those apps you get money for taking steps.
why cant he just buy something at walmart and refund it later to prevent the damage of the great reset
Ryan is the goat
what s the name of that diary study app ?
17:39 THE VOICE CRACK

Sell the bike!
-Luisa Capetillo (1879 – 1922, Planet Earth) “Aunque todos somos hermanos, algunos mueren de hambre y de alimentos, ropa y zapatos. Y con tantos desnudos y pelado-mientras lo útil y necesario se pudre en los depósitos y almacenes” “Although we are all siblings, some die of hunger and of foodstuffs, clothing and shoes. And with so many naked and bare-while what is useful and necessary rots at the depots and warehouses”
ALREADY 9 MILLION SUBS BY THIS IS OVER HE WILL HAVE LIKE 15 MILLION
We love JUPITER!!!!!
Wait I am the only one to notice that Paul's Donations aren't on the list anymore, what happened?? He would have #1 by 50k
Good morning and goodnight my homie Ryan
Can’t you buy more stuff for inventory (i.e. more hammocks) before you end your day to be safe from The Great Reset? Once you need the money or have enough for the ticket to NC, return the extra inventory items to buy the ticket.
look at the first day you starting to grow beard
Your marrage is going down
9 MILLION YEAAAAAAAA
Day 2 of asking Ryan to put his money in a visa pre paid card

I think you should not consider survey money a part of the total since you said the money should only come from the penny
This series has been so amazing keep it up Ryan! 😇

Epic
Day 2 until Ryan reply
Congratulations on 9mil (you just hit it a few minutes ago)
If he got reset today he would be ded
People out there really tipping less than $2. I've never tipped less than $7 even for the smallest order.
I bet at the end of this series… Ryan will reach 10 million subscribers! :D
CONGRATULATIONS ON 9 MILLION 🎊🎉🍾🎈

Why do you shake the coffee ?
Hey, Ryan, Quick suggestion, two maybe. you should buy a uhaul truck because you can take those cities to city or state to state. Also, to protect your money you should buy a visa gift card, so that you can save your money from the great reset, and when you need it, you have money
My OCD was acting up your entire walk with Jupiter; my brain kept going, "FIX THE LEASH! WHY WON'T YOU FIX THE LEASH!" I've been loving the adventure so far! Keep up that momentum!
3:45 two L's make a W bro
happy early 9 million subscribers Ryan! You inspire me so much and you are so generous. The series is so interesting and I wake up every day excited to watch one person. and that's your videos. I hope you get to give the penny to Jimmy in a month and continue doing what you are doing. never give up and stay strong.
8.99 Million subs HHHHHMMMMMMMMM

Man did the whole dog walk with his leish between his legs🤣
Bro you have 12 days left!
WHERE DID PAUL GO
“Thanks for the opportunity” 😂
Surly he really should’ve been reset again because of dr Mike ?
you shouldn't walk a dog with a leash under the armpit like that as it can cause chaffing especially in warm weather
Do 1 penny for every one that turns on notifications
POGCHAMPERSSS

U told us that ur going to north Carolina 🤣
Sooo what happened to Paul Dodds top donation of 150k? 😅
Ants
Ryannnnn ❤️❤️🐐
Why was Ryan manhandling his burrito during the interviews
he keeps on using the chipotle in non emergencies
lets get this beat to 10mil before this 30 day series is over
bruh he was at 8.92M yesterday, dang man way to go.
Ngl seeing all the people not tipping for the food deliveries is horribly upsetting…
man that uber pay is bad
he gettin great reset tomorrow
Lowkey wish that there was a clock on the screen in the video so we could know what time it is for Ryan. I personally feel like that would be kinda cool and would help provide some context for us. Regardless I massively appreciate the hard work and effort that Ryan is putting into this challenge, I love how he is wholesome and selfless and is only doing this for the people who really need help. God bless your soul Ryan your heart is really big and God picked an amazing person to spread love and help.
HES ALMOST AT 9MIL
I’ll donate 1$ for every like on this comment
So close to 9M Subscribers.
Hey idea Ryan what if you install more survey apps so that you can get more money from different surveys
so close to 9m
i can see him being cautious after the challenge just waiting for the GREAT RESET...
Bro Ryan, the food delivery technique is the way to go 💯🙌
Because of this man I have proper morning routine: Use the restroom Get breakfast and cofee  Watch this series. I wish that this would last forever
this dude is hilarious. I love the awkwardness and goofyness
What happened to Paul Dodds donation?
Still wanna know what’s going on with Paul dodds
i wish i could donate 50k so i could call me self the muffin man
Congrats 60k subs on 1 day and like 3 hours
Those ants were so big and scary I literally started crying
What if instead of starting at a penny after THE GREAT RESET he had to go back a city and start at a penny there and he had to go to a certain number of cities and deliver pennies before the 30 days is over that would be a cool part 2
Wooooo he ate a borito
What is the survey app
Bro has beef with vegetables
Your great but your Chipotle order is basic af
Just out of curiosity, how is one meal only 10 cents. Not taking anything away from Ryan; I think hes doing phenomenal.
Also for your fun drinks
WE LOVE YOU RYANN

If your man can successfully say a Disney movie inside joke....that's NOT your man!..  (and if you are not Hailey/Haly/Haley. I'm so sorry I don't know how to spell her name😭)  That's Ryan Trahan   O.o
Why does he always go with the same combination on the buritto??? Also geee he is eating so unhealthy!
Should’ve advertised in the Area on Facebook offering the service. That’s the ONLY way I got 12 clients within a month.
1 k more subs to 9m
I’ve been living in Spain the past 9 months and man does Ryan make me miss chipotle 😞🥲 I know where I’m going when I fly home 🌯
If ur squeamish over bugs then buy a hammock with a net attached by zipper
I like your videos that it made me go in McDonalds and buy 2 mad chickens and 1 ice coffee lol.
Lol he had 19 dollars left he mowed the lawn for 20 dollars and his count then was 29 dollars waittttttttt 19 plus 20 equals 29 wow I didn’t know :/
Hello ryan trahan i am from serbia (europe) i am planning go to america just to meet you and take a photo (btw i am already in america) in north carolina waiting for u :)
Why don’t you invest in a water bottle to refill in the gyms parks or fast food places? Since it will be hot or get hotter.
I wonder if he's coming through rdu. Might see him haha
Idea: put the time it is for you on screen
Andrew really left my boy no tip at all😭💔
OMG HES GONNA HIT 9 MILLION SUBS LITERALLY TODAY, HE WAS ON 8.3 MILL YESTERDAY
16:53 best moment
tommorow ryan will get great reset because shopify donated 69420 dollars
You said at the start that all money had to be from the penny but you’ve gotten a lot of money from the survey applications
Try the Bacon egg and cheese McGriddle at McDonald’s it’s the best breakfast item on the menu.

Hi
The fact that I really thought there was going to be huge living ants on the sidewalk or something 😂 I love Ryan’s humor 😂
You could try door to door salesman  And  >1000 more subs for 9 million     LESS GO 9 MIL 1 MIL MORE
Nice job man
Can we get Ryan to 10 mil tho?
When tf did Shopify donate $69k?? I don’t remember that reset
One day can you say "Good mourning Hadley"? It would make me soooooo happy!
What was the cost of gas
thus guy eats a mcdonalds every series
How is your phone not died
Realistically speaking I think by the end of the series he will be at 9.5 million at the minimum and 10 million at the maximum
0:53 that’s the perfect dad joke. I’m sure your dad is so proud right now…
What he is doing is so cool.
Paul dodds donations are gone.... that's unfortunate.....
What about Uber eats deliveries
bruh pls cut your beard you dont look good
I like that out of anyone or any company here, Shopify is the first to donate $69,420.
I fell like in the next video Ryan will by a plane ticket to the next city, but in the same video THE GREAT RESET will be activated. Now what?
Still curious why he took Paul dodds of the leaderboard
i was behind by 15 days and i watched them all in 2 days lol
Where the Indians at?
Jupiter gang 🤘
The ants though OMG LOL
Your almost to 9 mill congrats
Ryan you should keep all the receipts and figure out how much you spent in total for this whole series
Anyone else notice the $69,420 donation lol and nice to see Isaiah potato in a vid😂
9 MIL SUBS!!
Wow he made it so far
This is what I wake up for
is no one gonna talk about the fact that this man has eaten fast food 18 days in a row and hasn't washed his face for said 18 days and his skin is CLEAR  jealousy.
BTW way the reason they said no was because the grass is short look for the lawns with long grass not short
is it just me or have anybody else seen this ?  The top donation leaderboard has changed on day 16 Paul dodds what’s the biggest donator and now he’s gone what happened???
you should do the same type of thing but going across the world
Imagine Spock watching this like bruh dad wut —__—
how bout them apples kills me lol🤣
10 more subs on to 1mil
What happened to Paul Dodds?
bro when are you coming to branson misouri?
Let’s go Tom grossi

Best series on YouTube
lol ur so funny... i was so scared when u started talking about the ants....lol i love this series
That man Anthony tipped 0$
Hey ryan I was just wondering what happens to the money that you lose because of "THE GREAT RESET"
Please buy bike lock and sunscreen
I swear him and Isaiah are friends cause in Isaiah’s video were he gets people to scan his leg Ryan does it and Isaiah donated and he was in this video!!!! Btw ik I probably spelt his name wrong. Sorry 😐
Wouldn't it be $30 bc he had $19 and he paided him 20 so $39
You should get a cheap water bottle so you don’t have to pay for so many cups or keep the same cup
The random interviews are so chaotic
wait what happend to paul dots he isnt on donation board
Ryan i remember you photoshopped famous people in your pictures, and you did a penny challenge wit your friends, Youve come a long way
Check out jstu's newest video they did what you did
Total Chad.
What happend with Paul Dodds' donation?? We need to know
how have you not gotten a bike lock lol XD DONT get a U lock, do your research
Bro just buy sunscreen
he's so fucking wholesome u cant hate the dickhead lol
you problem could get more clint if you low the price down by 10
Can anyone tell me the outro sound when Ryan checks donations cause it’s such a vibe😍😇
Why is there so much hate on Ryan and this series ur awesome bro keep up the good work

bro got a great reset and didnt start with a penni
14:07 dog walking app name please

Enjoying every moment of this perfect thing to start off the morning with!  Keep going man!   Remember everyone SUBSCRIBE! 😎
youtube, mcdonald's and chipotle should be embarrassed with themselves for not donating a single penny, especially since this series is literally about FEEDING AMERICA. ryan has given them endless amounts of free promo and they couldn't care less.
I initiate the Great reset
We almost at 9 million baby
Is it just me or that I'm wondering where is the money going when he gets reset, does he give it away or something?

The amount of calories Ryan is burning in this series is insane 😂
Yikes, this comment section is horrible. Anyways, keep going Ryan! This series is amazing and what you’re doing will help so many people.
You should do 10 orders every day for 3 days to get the 95 dollars
Seriously buy a visa gift card, it’s that easy!

Can we just take a moment to just think about the fact that his editor and camera man have the strangth to do all these things for Ryan just to keep us entertained? Edit: 1k away from 9mm! Cg!
Ayo Jupiter gang
ON ROAD TO 9 MILLION SUBS! Let's get this man to 9 million subs for all of his generosity!

19:49- Bro where is Paul Dodds? Dident he donate 150,000?!?!
If you do surveys your breaking the rules. Everything MUST come from the PENNY
I like how the theme song plays when a bad word is said!
After this is over there better come a "i survived 365 days on 1 penny" and travel around the world
8.99 mil defhurehurheufhbregr

Loved the Moana reference :)
What happens to the money when Ryan gets reset? Does he give it away or something?

Am I the only one who’s been frequenting McDonalds more often because of this series?
$988328 raised almost 1 million!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey he got paid 20 and it only went up ten from 19 dollars to 29 dolars
Ryan, You gotta buy something refundable (protected by the GREAT RESET), and then return it the next day

Does he even know he gained 2million subs
What happened to Paul Dodd's donation?
i was so confused of how its nighttime with Ryan, but only 8:00 am here, till i realized we have different time zones 😂
I also slap my Chipotle burritos before eating them 15:28
watching this video when you have 8.99 Million Subs
Why not just buy something then return it to save yourself from the great reset
Can someone please do a “The great reset” posses compilation.?? I die every time Ryan does one 😂😂😂😂 this is the great series ever! Hi from Peru 🇵🇪
Describe me in one word *cricket* * cricket*
hailey watching this 10:00-10:16 be like 😒😨
Tom Grossiiiii
i forgot about this and now when it ends im gonna watch it all over and trust me it will be worth it
The amount of portable chargers this man probably has to charge his phone must be incredible
Everybody that watches this series wakes up every morning excited to go on YouTube and see what Ryan is doing…. It’s wholesome how positive that is
Where is Paul DoDds
Lol the ants had me laughing
can i get a penny
ryan, thank you for supporting such an honorable and helpful cause. Thanks to you gaining the support of the world, more people will have food on their table. This is undoubtedly a humanitarian service and youre doing amazing. Thank you again.

Ryan sacrificing his running career for YouTube was the best decision I’ve ever seen. Big fan since your highschool days.
Sooo what happened to Paul dodds.. he wasn’t on the list
Use the bike when walking the dog
Why didn’t he reset?
were's paul dodds
Ryan's videos have convinced me to drink some mcdonalds iced coffee
good progress so far Ryan, keep it up. Soon enough you will succeed in giving that penny to MrBeast. it’s unfortunate that the lawnmower plan didn’t go so well
Morning routine!!
I know that burrito is dry lol
Do the same challenge but going home this time in 30 days
Has Ryan been wearing the same shirt for 18 days respect ✊
hey ryan my grandma thinks your cute
My town has has a fair called Corby pole fair it happens every 20 years since 1587 something like that it’s between 1500-1590
Anybody else thinking he should put like $10 into some stock when he has money to speng freely
anybody else wondering what happened to Paul Dodd's donation???
We are on a mission to save private Ryan so donate money
Bro actually pulled the mower backwards rather than turning 💀
what happens if you finish the challenge before day 30?
The big ants were so scary 😣😖
🍺🍺🍺
Jupiter and Toro.. Legends
Hey weird question, if the doc donated 100k yesterday why wasn’t the great reset activated?
Why is Paul Dodds off of the highest donations list?  Didn’t he donate $150,000+? Or did he take it back? Just curious.
Lol😅 the huge ants he showed at 11:09 made me laugh so hard my heart skipped a beat at first cause i thought he was serious but in the end i had a good laugh!  Anyways im proud of thus dude he is so happy all the time,how does he do it?!
PENNY THEME: 7:19
What is the name of survey app 8:17
what happens to money after you get reset?
I bet you almost everyone watching this series has a mental morning routine to watch the new Ryan Trahan video. I have no idea what I and so many others are gonna do when this is sadly over. 😭
if you can’t get a lawn mower to start all the way but you hear it trying, lift the 2 front tires. if you hear it starting to stall/die LIFT. THE 2. FRONT. TIRES.
good morning lawnmowners
isaiah photo
this is soooooo cool
I really appreciate the effort you put in to these videos
I predict that Ryan will get to 10 million subs by the end of the 30 days! To everyone who reads this message I hope you have a wonderful day!
This has been my evening routine for 16 days now, i don'twant this to stop no cap
Thanks for giving me my food Ryan it was delicious
He really had me on the edge of my chair with those ants.....bruh
Genuinely going to start supporting the brands that have actually donated. Like Panera bread
Sup bro 😎
I’ve been watching since day 3, love the videos!!!
Congrats on 9 mil my boi!
Nice 1 step to 9 million
Today at McDonald’s I got a McMuffin and as I was ordering I was thinking “Morning Routine”
Watching him do food delivery shows me that either I tip too much when it comes to food delivery, or most others are really cheap with a tip.
He said he was going to go to the galaxy one day and he was like oh ok he got me on my nerves
Where is Paul Dods
Hi
what happened to Paul Dodds???!!!?!?!?!?!
Imagine him doing the this across earth In a year
if  Ryan wins $50k   from a lottery ticket  is that a great reset????????????? or does he have to donate it ???????????
Ryan what surveys do you do for money I need some cash rn
You were in my dream, dressed as a pink bush with a dog who was also dressed as a pink bush. You went to Disneyland and met a bunch of tiktokers and then the cashier there started singing opera when he saw your dog. It was a great dream
Bro. he ate that burrito for a year!😂
Should have had a 500,000 donation award where you have to lose everything and go back to Los Angeles
Shopify with the bomb donation. Lols
Every donation = The song at the end getting longer.   Can we get enough donations to hear the full version!?
Fun fact about the alkali water you were given, it gets neutralized when it enters your stomach due to your stomach *acid*

Ryan needs to buy a southwest gift card. Cheap flights, free bags, protected from the reset!

I love your videos so very much Ryan can you pretty please with a cherry on top shout me out
Please do the next video on cinematic mode only
Let's get the guy a respect.He's so hardworking and good guy!
Why Don't u walk run or cycle to the next state and you could save a lot of money
Anyone have the link to the music used in this video?

Asparagus is the worst vegetable I can confirm
Where does the Camera Man sleeps??

Me and my sister are always watching Ryan together when this series started every morning the first thing we do is watch him I absolutely love this series! Keep up the hard work Ryan <3!
Hi
That’s funny I just watch the movie Moana
/\
dude's looking like a lobster
Ayo lets get Ryan to 10 mil
you should get a tattoo of a penny
19:14 It feels really good knowing that i am worth even one penny and that i can help even with the little i have. I am really happy knowing that i can help even with one subscribe.
day 2 of wondering what happened to Paul Dodds
This is unironically the best series that was ever done on YouTube, and the fact that it’s for charity is the icing on the cake! Keep it up Ryan!
What about the great reset from Dr Mike last episode?
1.4m Vu and 140k like  this is awsome
Wow my dude did so much in one day. Good job so proud of you 👏
I love Jupiter’s little bow tie, so cute 🥰

The hash browns with no ketchup gets me idk why lol
What do you do with the money from the great reset do you donate it to your fundraiser or what?
Lol
Bout to hit 9 min good job sir
Fun fact: he is on the 22nd day
This series really makes you realize how hard it is to make money.
yo what part of north carolina because i live there
Why is Paul dodds no longer in the list?
where is Paul Dodds he donated 150000$
Day 2 of saying hi to ryan
Me and my sister are always watching Ryan together when this series started every morning the first thing we do is watch him I absolutely love this series! Keep up the hard work Ryan <3!
. If he gets to day 30 it will be the 28th. But the 30th day will be published on the 30th day of june. So Ryan is day 27 because day 8 he said it was memorial day. 8+18=26
Dat burrito slap tho
What happened to paul? He’s not in the top donation anymore even tho he donated 150k$
LETS COMPLETE THIS RYAN   LOVE FROM INDIA ❤️❤️❤️

You should start letting people from the comments make your ✨chipotle burrito✨
Ryan: I got a feeling Me: inside my bones Ryan: that tonight’s going to be a good night  Me: well dang,

Can someone make a compilation of him slapping a burito lol
18:31 bo2 zombies round startup plays
I’m sorry but we have to talk about how shopify donated $69,420 😭
I’m following along
I swear to god if McDonald’s or LSU or some other brand that Ryan has mentioned doesn’t donate then I’m going to be mad. So you can’t donate to someone who’s given you free promo but you can comment on someone else’s tiktok?
Yoo I made it in the video fuck asparagus
mc Donald's hash browns slap
When Ryan said alkaline was alcohol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
finally i've cought up with the latest episode

Love the videos Ryan! My dog and I watch these videos together every day

The fact that Ryan’s videos became a daily morning routine for a lot people, including me.
Your hair looks stunning.
Bot be like: - Can we just appreciate the amount of effort he puts in his videos😂😂😂😂
Awesome video

W
Woah
As a citizen of Baton Rouge, I would like to say, go tigers……I gues
you should sell spicy thing for cheep so then you can sell water for a lot lol
I knew it the lawn mowing method would be a bummer
How do ya get camera men all the time for free and and eat only just once a day.
Youtuber who have grinded that I have seen so far are on an insane level. But this guy bro he is like 5 parallel universe ahead of them 💜💜💜
what happens to the moeny that gets reset in the great reset?
Ok but has he mentioned how he charges his phone??? 🫰
W Shopify to donate 69420
Respect to that guy paying our boy Preston. Easily one of the most generous acts I’ve seen so far in this series.
Surprised he didn’t get famous for his corny and cringy sentence every time he speaks
Top comments : haha morning routine comment go brrrrrrrrr Haha verified person GO BRRRRRRRR
Ryan, why do you try to bike ride your way to the next city or take several cheap buses to get to the nearest state? You're wasting your time sticking around in one place.
Where did Paul Dodds go on the leaderboard?
If you heart my comment I will be pretty happy😏
day 18!!!
ryan when your checking donations give your money to preston then if you get reset it won't do anything
Why is he smile fading away each day
Donating nr.65
low key mcdonald should sponsor him, cus i’ve been craving that coffee for days.
Noo i don't want this series to end is my favourite series now, i don't know what i will do without it😭😢
1:09 your telling me america has PLASTIC STRAWS? This is not fair us uk people use weird paper ones 😭
i love the challenge  you are doing Ryan keep up the good work btw and you are one of my fav youtubers
You should try to sign up for instacart if u get another car rental in the future
Yo ppl we have to great reset him so that this series goes for longer
How he has that much money, he got reseted in day 17
“My names Brandon, okay nice to meet you brenden.”

Air b n b!
Ryan is slowly going insane
ryan remind me of spongebob
I realise the final episode is on my birthday 😃
You should buy something and than return it and that is basically like a credit card (please do this than say thanks jackson) love you
How did you charge your phone .??
Litteraly I watch almost everyone who gets a shout out. Shocked that Tom Grossi donated I would think he would not had found this due to his completely different platform.
Is it me or is the audio out of sync?
Keep up the amazing content :))
If someone based an Internet meme on you, it would have impeccable grammar.
Every time Ryan says “the great reset” they should edit it like how Crocker does “fairy god parents”
♥️
Fun fact: Octopuses and squid have three hearts.
Not that it was ever a doubt in my mind, but the fact that he shows his failures as well shows how genuine this series is
Why is no one talking about the amount of cardio he does everyday! RESPECT
Bro I am wake up every morning and I go on YouTube to watch this video
W Video
It’s a petty he didn’t win the scratch card because he earned them through the challange therefore meaning he could finish the challange fast if he won $500
Paul Dodds is no longer at the end D:
Thanks Ryan for making peoples day by posting these.
That’s so cool that u met   photo
anybody else noticed that porsche at 14:35 ?
Jupiter looks like my dog
MY GUY TOM GROSSI COMING IN AND HELPING OUT LETS GO!!!
Some of his jokes are so cringy
Why Didn’t he reset
You should do Uber eats on one of those lime scooters
What happens to Paul dodds
Give it up for Shopify who donated 69,420
Probably the best YouTube series I’ve ever watched - really entertaining, Ryan!
I don't wanna ruin it, but... 6942 comments. YAS

I'm sorry for the lottery tickets, genuinely thought they would of won you some money
Bro McDonald’s should just get a Ryan Trahan meal
Ryan just casually palming a burrito during the interviews is classic
went n copped an ice coffee to enjoy this one
DOGGIES YAY
This series could be titled “eating McDonald’s every for 30 days”
maybe hire a pressure washer ... could be better
I want him to do a series where he has to start in North Carolina with 1 penny and go back home lol
I hate cinematic mode but i love ur vids
Yo Ryan granbury tx is not that far from you there is a big town square that I would say has 300 people dayly
Isaiah Photo in the video

Loved the Moana reference!!! Lol
I think he’s finally started going insane
Ayyo whats the outro music?
Why isn't paul dods on the donation board
Come on!! 1 more mil!! So close!
Am I dumb or what happened to Paul Dodds on the donation list
Not only is this series entertaining and interesting and for an amazing cause but I think we should all aspire to be as positive and wholesome as Ryan. Despite all the hard work he has to put to make money he is still so happy. Thank you for the amazing content Ryan.
u started the serie on my birthday Yupeeeeeeeeeee
Juuuuuuppppppppiiiiiittttteeeeerrrrrr gannngggggg
Alternate title: "I Survived On Fast Food For 30 Days"
I also love the part where you saw Isiah and did the great reset 😂
19:20 1.1M more than usual  LOL
Hey Ryan, what if it rains =o
You should get a credit card so if the great reset happens your money will be safe
Man should just buy stuff, and return everything once it has enough value to get his plane ticket
hey ryan i don’t know if you will see this but can u bring awareness to rhinos, the link is on the coyote Petersons video, there has only been a couple thousand dollars donated and the rhinos are almost extinct. just watch the video if you need more context. plz
THOSE ANTS!!!
Cofe
Did I miss something or why didn't he get reset by dok Mike on day 17? I am just into the vid, but he starts with 26 dollars
Ryan you had 8.77m 2 days ago now youre at basically 9 mil wtf
what is the song at the end of the vid it is so cool
Where is Paul dodds on the leaderboard and oh. I two more great resets coming
wait, if all profit must come from the penny, and he's walking dogs to earn money. wouldn't that be classified as cheating?
Imagine Ryan won the lottery and had like $50,000 just to be reset
Reply below: Jupiter or Toro?
Stop using the survey app… those profits DO NOT COME FROM THE PENNY!!!
yessirrrr
Good morning!
Hiiiii🖤
“Why don’t you mow lawns to make money” this is why

Macdonald's have to activate at least 1 "reset "lol
This man is brave still being able to film around ants that size, geez.
????
We love you juipitet
Uber Eats was like damn dude, here's 3 dollars more because you literally made 2 dollars with one order 😆
does anyone know the name of the survey app? which he says is from the black market 🤣😅🤣
9 mil coming up!
Why didn’t the great reset happen when doctor Mike donated 100,111$
Andrews chipotle order didn’t even tip Ryan we should rally together and sacrifice Andrew for the cause
Ryan Trahan
Bro, Ryan was in my dream last night walking a dog hahaha
Ryan this series has made me be happy for the first time in months 😊
Suuuuuuuuuuuuuupppppppppppppp
This series has made me rly wanna try Mcdonalds iced coffee, idk y

Bro, Isaiah Photo donated 5000 at the beginning of the series
Dang paul dodds got rolled out of here

Bro didn't even ask for a water cup hebaint even trying to save money
Why don’t you do multiple delivery apps at once?

guys im starting to say good morning sunshine every day when i wake up!!!!
how and where do you charge your phone?
11:22 HxH Chimera Ant arc
5:04 avg american dude.😃
"you guys seen Moana?" is giving "you got games on your phone?"
If you see people with a broken mailbox offer to fix it for 100 dollars in labor and the cost of the mailbox. You can normally talk people into going to the store and picking out there mailbox then you don’t have to transport all of the materials and the only tool you should need is some posthole diggers
18:02 "short". . . . . .XD
Show this video's to beggars and all other people who ask for money while having fit and fine body  This man starts his day with nothing and ends up with hundreds of dollars at the end of the day
Morning routine
where do u charge ur phone
$2 dollars for an Uber eats order. That’s insane. People need to tip.
Rayan I love ur videos,keep up the good work. PS hope you beat Dr Phil in subs
Why is paul dodds no longer on the money leaderboard??
My question though how does Ryan charge his phone?
My suggestion is to eat some fruits if you don't like vegetables. You need some vitamins. Stay healty and keep the grind, we all love you. You are a good man.
Ryan is cheating on Spock...smh.
This series has to be one of the most entertaining in the Youtube community at this very time. NOW YOU GO DELIVER THAT PENNY TO JIMMY!! 🪙
why do ya spend 29 dollars on chipotle drink?
100,000 is coming 😊
Lol.
This guy will never give up even if he has 0 dollars he always finds a way
B
I feel like Chiptole And McDonald's need to sponsor Ryan for this series after the number of times he has had food there lol.
Accepting no or low tip orders will haunt you later. No less then $2 a Mille for tips
Ryan for the love of god extra rice beans and cheese on your burrito is free at Chipotle
Where is Paul Dodds?!
Ryan, I love your videos sooo much! The second I wake up, I watch the new video. The part that had me dying was when you went on a walk with Jupiter. Keep up the great work and don’t let anyone or anything stop you and hope you deliver that penny!
His body is made up of 60% McDonald’s and 40% chipotle and his blood type is ice coffee
Ryan could make paint drying into content
did he really just say fresca like that...?
Don’t mess with Maui when he’s on a breakaway 😂
What happened to Paul Dodds?
What happened to Paul dodds??????Dodds??????? He's no longer in the list of donors and he "donated" over 150k??
I just LOVE how he says ‘good morning sleepyheads :)’ it is just so gentle btw I dont want this series to end I suggest that u also do the same thing while coming back and keep up the good work on DEEZ videos.
Why didn't the 100k donation from Dr. Mike trigger great reset? just curious
why not mail the penny after 30 days lol
The big ants tho :O
Your so close but yet so far and you might you some people you know
What happened to the 150K donator
Where is Paul Dodds?
This series is so good. Great work Ryan
With the amount of times he’s sung the tonight’s gonna be a good night song in this series you just know he’s been listening to it lol  Great work though Ryan!
DONT SHOW ME THOSE ANTS, THEY ARE SUPER SCARY 😵
Ryan how do you charge your phone
JUPITER GANG!!!!!!!!!!!
Shopify at 69,420 lmao
I really feel like that I will be very sad when this series will end and a lot of people probably will think the same . You should make another series like this a lot of people like it
10:22 *gets sent to the backrooms*
Look at shopifys donation
Day 3 of asking about Ryan's thigh tattoo. Didn't see it in the clips today
Ryan you should stop eating McDonald’s it’s bad for you there’s a chance It will make you die
Just commenting again that the dog walking profits did not come from the penny
Again..... Did Paul Dodds just get wiped off the face of the earth or did i miss something lol
19:15 HE’S ALMOST AT 9 MILLION SUBS!!!!!!
Ngl we need more of Ryan walking random dogs
is anyone curious as to what happened to paul dodds?🥲 his name hasn’t been at the end of the video today or yesterday!
If you had waters to sell at that event that would be so cool
what is that tattoo on his left thigh?
Imagine ordering doordash to see Ryan on his bike sweating
ayo ryan u should get fetch rewards and with all the stuff u should bye scan the recepits for money back
Buy a Pre-paid Visa card in order to keep some money you can spend anywhere after the great reset!
Absolutely binged all of this yesterday and now I am here. Ryan, I love this mission so much. You got this.
Andrew is an asshole. No tip? How unappreciative
Am I the only one who can’t believe how many food deliveries only tipped $1-3?
Ryan you should donate all the money you got reset from
What about great reset ?
Guys can we talk about how Ryan Trahan has gained 1.2 million subs in 2WEEKS! This is proof he is the best youtuber on the platform rn.
Nice vid bro🔥🔥🔥
18:09 oh no those dude
I would so help you out with this if I could. If I could, I would so give you like $100-$150 and get you closer but I can't since I am so busy with things.
Tell Brandon to get some sleep.
is nobody talking about how shopify donated $69,420?
believe in god and jesus
O skip the tutorial also donated
This series is so awesome I see it evrytime he uploads is just like watching a series in Netflix lol 😂
CaT
Isiah Is a youtober
I ordered a McChicken and Vanilla iced coffee at McDonalds to honor you.
didn't he get reset ??
MR RYAN TRAHAN USE A VISA GIFT CARD IT WORKS FOR EVERYTHING
he looks a bit like he could be Gordan Ramsey's son.
buy a basket also zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
He should put his money in the bank, or on a check to save him from *THE GREAT RESET*
has anyone else noticed there is no Paul Dodds???? like he donated $150,000 and he isn't mentioned??
Why don’t you do a 2 in 1 and walk dogs while doing something else like selling water
jupiter gang
Best series ever

YOOO ISAIAH
LOVE JUPITER OMG
You can still sell any gift cards you buy for a bit less money. Enough sites that allow you to do this. Could completely protect you from the great reset 😉
Imagine Ryan walking your dog
17:06 I was hoping her name would be "AND PEGGY"
Is it wrong that I wish this series would last forever, this is honestly a great addition to all of our morning routines not gonna lie
The next city is hopefully Nashville
Ryan buy a prepaid visa gift card so it will be protected and you can buy anything you want
I am subscribed I dint even got half peny
That Moana joke was top tier
Bro whats the app name i need it
If you want I can teach you how to cut grass.
Walk more dogs lol
just donated 1dollar, thanks for being an incredible person
11:19 will you know what they say even things in taxes is bigger
Does anyone know what breed Jupiter is?
you need to take care of your self
Just realized that Paul Dodds (the guy that donated 150.000) isn't in the top donations list anymore, what happened to him?
You could have just used their lawn mowers?
What happened to paul dodds
Anyone else get triggered by the light placement in that Macdonalds in the beginning
@Ryan Trahan You should do something similar to this ..... Travel to a subscriber that actually needs help that works day to day but is stuck in a not so good situation in life. Collect donations at a smaller lighter level for reset and other things to happen along the way. Once you make it to the subscriber give them the donations or pick a bunch of subscribers who actually need help and deliver donations to each person. You would change all of their lives. Love you motivation...
This is my morning routine! I watch it every day! Love your videos! Keep smiling and Stay kind! 😇
U right moana is amazing
This is my morning routine! I watch it every day! Love your videos! Keep smiling and Stay kind! 😇
It’s not a $95 bonus but it guarantees you make at least $95 for 30 deliveries. If you don’t make $95 from the deliveries then they give you enough to get up to $95 :(
Road to 10Million
Do you want to make money online?
What happened to Paul Dodds?? Does anybody know?
Bless the people who watched your bike and God watching it the first time and both times.. and the interviews with people were so fun lmao you really did the great reset stance in front of something that made me LOL
I love Jupiter.
There's something so fresh and clean about Ryan's content... just fun to watch!
What app does he use do deliveries
Yo what happened to Paul Dodds donation?
good morning
Not enough warnings for the ants clip
and shave
Finally somebody respects the mcgriddle
2022, the year where smoking grass is cheaper than cutting it.
11:10 i thought you got THE GREAT RESET
im convinced ryan only eats chipotle
AYO x3 hammock check
People are saying you are facking it
Ryan needs a new Chipotle order.
12:34 who else thought he said racist?
where is paul dodds on the dono list at the end??
Absolutely binged all of this yesterday and now I am here. Ryan, I love this mission so much. You got this.
doing food delivery’s is a really good idea but I think you should take up higher request, $2.00 +tip for 1 delivery aiiiiiint really worth it. Some city’s are very busy in the night and the food delivery request get to their highest. but then it’s night, scary!!
Does anybody know what survey app he uses?
no paul dodds at the end ? ?
what if someone made a videogame about this. it would be so fun, it could be called 30 days to mrbeast xD
Whats the name of the app at 8:20? Thanks guys
I love the vid and I think you should do it for 60 days next time but try to deliver it to a different country
Bro me and ryan would be the bestest of friends/ bff cause bro get that drink mix ON!
That moana reference 😀
Sad but this is what my actual bank account usually  looks like
NO DOCTOR MIKE WHYYYY
You should do something similar to this ..... Travel to a subscriber that actually needs help that works day to day but is stuck in a not so good situation in life. Collect donations at a smaller lighter level for reset and other things to happen along the way. Once you make it to the subscriber give them the donations or pick a bunch of subscribers who actually need help and deliver donations to each person. You would change all of their lives. Love you motivation...
Wy is Paul dots not the top hé sonated 150k van somone pls say it to Ly wy
Fill in the blank with ANY word. At yo, _____ check! He will say it eventually
Bro I hate bugs and I actually looked away and then I heard your sarcastic tone and looked and literally died laughing of myself. 💀💀
Bruh just met isaiah photo?
17:52, did he try to kiss him
If he got $50k from a lottery ticket would that be a Great Reset????
top 5 youtubers carrying youtube - Ryan trahan
Ryan your face had a sunburn at the night lol

I almost puked after seeing those ants. This is why I try to stay at least 5 miles away from anything at all times.
Shoutout to the guy that said cinematic mode was dope
Ill be so sad when this ends, this journey had started when my exam timetable came i started writing notes watching this and took breaks for watching this....i love the cause hope u reach 10mil meals and subs

AYO x3 *******
i love Isiah photo so freaking muuuuch
You should go to Ohio!!
I’m gonna be lost after this series is over
my favourite part of the day
Damn bro, this so awesome, Jupiter looked like he was really happy walking with you, then again so did Toro too.  But yeah wag seems really good for length of walk compared to what you get paid, plus you get to spend time with animals which is always a plus, at least in my book.
Omg those ants were huge red as well even more dangerous 😂
Ryan i love the series and idea but respectfully you chipotle order is kinda an L. Seems dry and boring....
this is the last time i will ask, Ryan how do you charge your phone, ive asked 3 times
What happened to the $150,000 from Paul Dodds??
get sunscreen
U might have notifications on when he posts but I have a whole alarm on my Phone when he post and when to watch it. This is the first thing I do in the morning
Yay
What if he won the lottery
Those ants were to close for comfort
L andrew 0$ tip
I will do the great Reset the greatest reset ($200,000)
Why Paul dodds isn't in the list???
YESSS LONGER VIDEO!!!
Ryan your doing great

NICE job shopify!

The ones who really closed their eyes
great vids ryan keep up the good work 👍
what happened with paul dodds at the end credits?
what happened to paul dodds?
4:07 Don't give up if this is you guys! Knocking doors is tough but a do it for a living and you can get a 1 million no's, which is totally fine, but it's all worth it when you find that really cool nice person who genuinely is interested! SO COOL
I love this series so much from me watching you at 1 million subscribers to now is insane love you so much keep up the hard work!
Ryan- To protect your money from the great reset couldn’t you buy like a visa gift card or something?
Not only is this series entertaining and interesting and for an amazing cause but I think we should all aspire to be as positive and wholesome as Ryan. Despite all the hard work he has to put to make money he is still so happy. Thank you for the amazing content Ryan.
You guys should do this monthly but for different charities and different people at the same time can you imagine how much you would change so many people's lives
In my town we have concert on the green to CT but mine is like once a week
U need putting straw in coffee lessons
What happened to the Paul Dodds donation?
Yo Ryan what you whod get for donating 1000000 dollars to feeding America just asking
What happened to the 150k from Paul Dodds?
What happened with Paul Dodds Donation?? Its off the list? His donation has been off the list for a couple of days now. I had to go back and check how many.
hopefully you hit 10million subs by the end of this series
That why he needs coffee
Go to hotels in the morning so you can get free breakfast
Man this series is sooooo good. I am gonna miss it a lot. Thanks a lot for this Ryan!
What’s that server app called?
Paul doffs?
Tbh I’m gonna kind of miss daily vlogs these when he’s done.
certified penny classic
I kind of feel like flying to America and meeting him
I bet you almost everyone watching this series has a mental morning routine to watch the new Ryan Trahan video. I have no idea what I and so many others are gonna do when this is sadly over. 😭
The cinematic mode clip 😂😂
I was getting triggered when the leach was in between jupiters legs ocd kicked in I guess
Why not toro😭
what happened to paul dodds, does anyone know?
11:21 Bro those ants are so big😰
Ryan is literally doing this during the hottest heat wave we’ve had this year.
I'm mow lawns for work, and the way he mows the law just makes me 🤮
If he buys gold and silver, he can hoard money without the great filter being a problem.
did anyone else hear something talking in the backround at 6:54????
lol i thought he was looking at wood ants haha i never say "haha" but i guess i do now
Jupiter looks so cute
I feel like I got krissed watching ur vids :D
What happened to Paul Dodds on the donation leaderboards?
"Ayo Jupiter gang" "Ayo ..... uranus"
you should buy a new gift card for chipotle, and maybe one for mcdonalds
Ryan: Describe me in 1 word Me: Short
19:47 WHERE IS PAUL DODS
Chipotle needs to sponsor this man
9M
almost 9m sub's
Why isn’t Paul Dodds in the top donators
i might cry when he gets there
Go to chipotle, get a bowl, and say no to everything
What happened to Paul's $150 000?
That was a good one with the ants
Anyone else saw the new episode and just wait until you eat to watch it lol
omg  your soo close to 9M!~
you should go to the uk London
I am going to donate 49,999.99 and subscribe.
The most savage great reset I think would be if Haley reset Ryan. 💀
UGH YOU GUYS STILL HAVE PLASTIC STRAWWWWWS UGHHHHHHH I MISS THEM SO BAD
That burrito you eating doesnt have any taste to it. Like eating cardboard boxes.
ryan has made it very clear he has no fucking idea how to cut a grass
cool
You could walk a dog whilst doing Uber eats
Btw anyone wondered how Ryan charges his phone 👀😶.........
U should stop using ur gift card
You should do Uber eats and walk dogs at the same time
What happened to Paul dodds, the top doner is just going to collapse like that?
im subscribe
Come to Illinois
Can we just appreciate how Ryan has raised over half a million meals meals for Feeding America. Props to you Ryan, you are what people need. 👍
You should walk dogs and do Uber eats
Ryan, such a kind person, i love this serie, i'm vibing with you every video bro.
*Ryan telling the survey he ate 40 mchickins and 10 chipotle burritos in the past week*  The survey: “nahhh jit trippin 🧢🧢” 😂😂
Day 18 of w
My man and his team grinding hard af. Feeding America in the process. Love to see it
yoo congrats ryan you just hit 1 billion views lessgoo :))
I got a money making method for you, you should walk/bike with a dog while doing Uber eats or Doordash. Idea?
What happened to Paul dodds
Put you’re tongue on the roof of your mouth to stop the brain freeze! Good luck Ryan!
I didn’t see Paul Dodd on the leaderboard? Where he be!!!!!
12:07 he shoulda said T H E  G R E A T  R E S E T 😭😭😭😭😭
Why isn't Paul Dodds on the leaderboard anymore?
Plz buy some sunscreen and aloe Vera. Also when you buy stuff if you check the prices at multiple stores you’ll probably find a cheaper price
LOL the ant part.. I laughed so hard
Does anyone knows why Paul Dodds' name doesn't appear on the leaderboard at endings anymore?
Everyone unsubscribe and subscribe, he will have to donate so much money
Second by second Hour by hour Day by day My respect for you reaches roof and beyond 💯🔥
and over and over and over LOL 😂
I been watching since day 1 lol
Hello
Challenge: do this in europe :)
I'm not promoting gambling but I was going to propose an idea. If Ryan believes he is going to get reset anyway he could use the remaining to buy lottery tickets. If he loses and gets reset not much is lost but if he wins technically in my opinion that's an investment that he could use later. Just an idea though.
Me and my sister are always watching Ryan together when this series started every morning the first thing we do is watch him I absolutely love this series! Keep up the hard work Ryan <3!
Didn’t you get reset?
The interviews are a grantee to actvite another great reset.
Why was watching Ryan mow lawns so satisfying
17:53 is that Isaiah photo from that rock beef thing? 👀
im gone to donte 100k money great rest so be care full
I love iseah photo
Loved the Moana reference :)
Bro can u come to Keller TX I want to see you lol
My morning rotten is brushed my teeth and watch you
Dude change ur burrito order 🌯
ADRESS THE PAUL DODDZ SITUATION!!!!
you look like a.....a......hmmm.....you look like a.............oh i got it......you look like the guy from..........uuuuuhhh.....
The climb is my song of the summer I sang it at camp with a counselor, just finished watching Hannah Montana the movie and now you start singing it in McDonald’s, it can’t get much better than this
Not be a douche or anything but didn’t you set a rule for yourself that all prophit must come from penny somehow? Anyways keep up the great work Ryan!
eating chipotle while watching this!! you inspire me ryan
everyone morning routine me night routine 😂😂😂😂 love from Pakistan ❤❤❤
That beard tho 😂
mcdonalds MVP
After doctor donated 100,111 you get reset today but u didn't why???
BRO HATS OF TO SHOPIFY FOR DONATING FUNNY NUMBER
"The climb by miley cirus is playing at mcdonalds" truer words have never been said
I also brush my teeth and put deodorant on
omg theres IsiahPhoto
1 year from now: Crossing The World On $0.01!
I hate youtube, but Ryan however....
How is your phone charging and also stop using the card when you have money
Crazy how Ryan has gained 1m and half a million in the past 18 days incredible
You cant double slap the same burrito Ryan!!
I hope  Ryan has a great reset when he has little money
Where was Paul Dodds on the top donations list
JC made me emotional
5:11 alkaline was also used in batteries before li-ion was invented.
You give me hope ! Thank you Ryan I would kick it with you jimmy and Steve all at once
Ayo Jupiter gang
12 days left for the series to end, it became a part of my daily routine, hope you come with another good ideas after you deliver the penny.
Ryan drinking his 0.99¢ and going oh yeah yep is just 👌 peak entertainment
How do i time travel
Just noticed man is growing a beard
What happened to Paul Dodd?
you are the best love the videos
Let’s get Ryan to 10 MILLION before the series ends Honestly he deserves it for all his hard work it’s so crazy to see how he has actually raised 8 million meals! He is AWESOME 👏
how are people eating a full meal for 0.01 $ again
I have been watching this series sense day1
Anyone else notice Paul Dodds name is gone ???
Why is no one talking about the interviewing part!😂😂😂
my bf thinks u should buy a southwest gift card & we love u
I’ve never mowed a lawn
I hope we have such a service here in Egypt I would do it for living as long as I like riding bikes
Unrelated but I feel like almost everyone I’ve seen owns that exact same lawn mower
The survey app is not a profit from the penny because you didnt buy the phone with the profit of the penny so uncool
.
i describe him as short
Please leave the link of the survey app in description pleases
It’s unfortunate that the lawn mowing idea didn’t work. It’s a very unique idea that changes things up, and it would’ve been ultra satisfying to see you clean out lawns left and right, but of course things don’t work out how they should. You’re doing great work anyways, Ryan!
It was so wholesome that your friend also got a money counter 😂😂
Paul Dodds withdrew?!?!?!?!?!?!
The best duo Isaiah trying to beat the rock and Ryan trying to beat mrbeast
Jupiter gang! like this comment ⬇️
Do we know what happened to Paul Dobbs he isn’t in the list of donators anymore?
Life won't be the same without this series :( Love Ryan & Haley Forever!!!
1 dollar provides 10 meals? on what planet? 1 Penny? thats just a lie. Doing it for money and face as always.

Should have tied the mower to the bike
I just started using this app. You have become part of my day. Thank you for the great content and thank you for what you are doing

Yoo you should make a part 2 when u deliver the penny but u return to u where u started
More cinematic mod plz LOL
Your bike
Just curious why Paul Dodds is off the donation list..? The guy who donated $150k.
The camera man tip 😭😭❤💪
you should get a debit card so if you get reset you get a free penny
potato :)
if you get to mrbeast are you gonna end the series? 🥺
how do you charge stuff?
Immaculate vibes
Where's he sleeping in these Hammocks?
What happened to THE GREAT RESET
Its really cool to see the entire youtube community come together to donate to Feeding America!! I wasn’t expecting my man Tom Grossi at all!!
honestly i love how inspirational and wholesome this man is<33
Ryan: -working hard- Youtubers about to donate: 😁😎🤣
Bro I was trying to tell you that but I first had to check the price
K.

At this point, Ryan is 50% Mcdonald and 50% Chipotle.
The secretive kitty microregionally mark because novel nearly prefer above a ill lynx. descriptive, unknown sarah
Hi ryan
Still wondering where is Paul Dodds with his 150.000 donations
Where did Paul Dodds go on the top donors list
WHAT HAPPENED TO PUAL DODDS btw shopify donated $69420 lol
Still don't know what happened to Paul Dodds LOL
Where's Paul Dodds in the donations pageeeee
Ryan: Describe me in one word. Them:👁️👄👁️
What do you do when you have to poo?
Keep on going 💪👍
Can please tell me on day 20 because it’s my birthday on that day😁
I don't believe the bike was where you left it...
65. Donation....less go turdboi420
You should use honey when u are buying rentals or other things
I guessed isaiah photo would be in the series like three days ago and i was right
Everybody that watches this series wakes up every morning excited to go on YouTube and see what Ryan is doing…. It’s wholesome how positive that is
What happened to Paul Dodds donations?
bro i have to sing the climb in class 💀💀💀💀
Is my addiction to this series good or bad
you make my works lunch break that much better, if you shout out the entire contry of portugal I'd be really happy :)
Describe me in one word... Short
Where’s Paul dodds
11:20 i think that ant-man's ants 🤣🤣🤣
This is why I'm watching YouTube because it's entertaining and his awkwardness is relatable. He is doing an amazing job with the fundraiser and getting to Mrbeast
How do you poop? I always feel so uncomfortable pooping in public bathrooms
can I donate u some sunscreen
11:39 bruh whyyyyy
tip: idk if its allowed but make a rule if u dontate 50 dollars to the feeding ameriaca charity u can store 30 dollars protected from the great reset
Go Ryan! Don’t give up bro! Love this series! Mrbeast doesn’t stand a chance against you!
The day u get enough money to buy a plane ticket could be when u grind uber eats. The $95 30 meal delivery bonus+ the uber eats salary could be enough for a ticket
I feel like you paid people to be generous even though I have no evidence i don't think people are that nice because of the world of greedy people but since I have no proof I have to live with the fact your doing well just keep it up with making the series it is really interesting but I have a challenge for you that is slightly harder try to make 1 million dollars in 4 months starting with $0.00
This is a comment
16:54 please don't make this tag a trand like binod
you do know water cups are free right?
have you tried the bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle? try it its good.
We need 16:55 to start trending
Ryan’s morning routine | brush teeth and put on deodorant   My morning routine | Wake up, pass out, wake up, watch my daily Ryan Trahan vid 😂

Someone deliver Ryan some vegetables
Respect to that guy paying our boy Preston. Easily one of the most generous acts I’ve seen so far in this series.
JUPITER GANG!!!
I'm gonna miss this series when it's over
Ryan in 2079: I bought the entire universe starting from $0.01!
New goal: don't shave until you finish the challenge
16:57 he dropped his paper
Idea for the next time: Sell Cold Water During the day
The little money bar on top of the camara guy killed me :}
Ryan: "dogs really love squirrels" Family Guy: "Yes" (writes a gory and bloody scene where Brian Griffin completely annihilates a baby squirrel)
Jupiter Gang! Jupiter is the Mafia heheheh
Can we get a donation tier that makes Ryan eat vegetables?
Hey

Can everyone here agree that this is the best series on youtube rn?
Morning routine check

What happened to the great reset?
Can we just agree Ryan is a really good youtuber Ryan if you see this you are doing an awesome part in this world and by feeding America you are a legend
5:07 actually it doesn’t balance out the acidity because it goes to your stomach which your stomach acid is a PH of 2 so regardless it will be the same no matter how much more PH it is
The thing is that all businessmen ever probably earned millions selling waters on the street
I’ve been watching these videos even since they started and they are awesome! Keep up the good work :)
Bro his Sanchez mustache
The way they all cheered when he finished the Burrito 😭
19:47 shopify got some explaining?
Song name at 19:00 pls

I feel like the survey app is kind of cheap, as the money from it didn’t come from the penny
*I pray that everyone who sees this becomes successful in life!*
What do you do with the money when you get reset?
What happened to Paul Dodds? Noticed his name isn't in the top donors anymore
RYAN DO A GOECACHES PLEASE IT WOULD BE FUNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Eating McDonald’s rn
I can’t believe you actually bumped into Isaiah photo lmao

This man has never operated a lawn mower.
Imagine if he gets reset everyday
I can't get this question out of my head. How is it that $1 can buy 10 meals?
Imagine he won 1 million dollars on the lottery tickets and got rested the next day
Because it is really hot
Thanks for the look away disclosure!

14:44  POV: u fart while on the toilet and this is what you hear  I’m not trying to be to Ryan it’s just that noise was funny
Hi
Point proven , thank you!
idk but î was trying to find out what college it was on his shirt in my mind and Î believe it’s Louisiana State University. Idk if that is a thing, but Î mean there is a Tennessee State University so maybe?
The fact that he put that ice coffee so close to the end of the table really makes me wanna kill myself
I’m soo confused bc in the last video the doctor donated 100,000 doesn’t that mean he gets a great rest? Why was his money still there tho. Someone explain I’m super confused
WHERE IS THE TATOO
I told you the lawnmower would work you just got to go to people with long grass that really needs to be cut
Spock been really quiet since Ryan signed up to W.A.G
Jupiter gang

Nobody gonna talk about the 100k donation that disappeared
Grossi Possi Packer Nation
Ryan you, hailey & Spock should do a roadtrip visiting all 50 states starting off with one $0.01 and raising more money for feeding America or other charities
Love Ur content 😀! Keep it up ryan
If someone activates the big reset next video, we all know what to do YouTube.
Ryan it might be cheating or something but if you buy a credit card and make a bank account in the series, you can save your money for the GREAT RESET
Hailey be like at home: when did he start lawn mowing?
What’s the survey app ? 👀👀
Jupiter is so quirky and fun
What happened to 150k guy
Gonna celebrate at the end of this series by eating Ryan’s go-to orders 😂😂 iced vanilla latte, deluxe breakfast, (spicy) McChickens, Chipotle burrito with rice, chicken, and cheese haha
This is morning routine for rest of the world For me it's evening (7pm) routine to get a snack and watch the video
Why is Isaiah photo there
Bruh is me or did I just see Spotify donated 69,420 😂😂
I was wondering where is paul dodds donation at the last.
Yo we love Jupiter Jupiter gangggg
You are like my morning routine I wake up and watch your video. I’ve been watching since you started this series so since day 1

Cinematic mode is a game changer
THE GREAT RESET
Update on total money made by Ryan this series: $3945.67
Honey didnt  you get reset yesterday?? Why do you have 26 dollars at the start? + when you got food at chipotle your money doesn't go down
I was your 1 mill viewer on this video 😮😃
Buy penny stocks so you can have something to hold your money and protect it from the great reset:)
He hit 8 mil subs on day 8 now 9 mil on day 19
What is cinematic mode on
17:18
Tabosco sause isn't even spicy it's plain.. really plain
Go Tigers and Ryan why u dont go to an competition u can sing so good i mean it sounds very nice <3
this episode was so fun, but i swear ryan was drunk at the end haha
TOM MOTHERLOVING GROSSI
Your going to get reset in 3 days.. 😈😈 or sooner 🤔🤔🤔
Dog walking is a great money making method. Cute dogs any your making money, amazing
Your almost at 9M fore me :D
i wonder how do you charge your phone. 🧐
Me waiting for burito slap but it never happen :( But then it does happen :^D
If you get reset do you donate the money
What happens if you get there before 30 days? Does it just end?
The best part of this series is like at 1 minute ur eating then at second u took the lawn mower this is why u are the best irl youtuber
This series has become my daily routine. I’m so happy the penny series is back, it was my favorite! Good luck Ryan!
Get a chipotle gift card to protect money in case of a reset… then sell it to someone when you need the money and get it back
To save money from getting reset, buy an item (with as much money as you want to save for later) and get a receipt so you can return it later for your money back!
Guys did u know Paul Dodds is an actor that was on Treasure Island and on Cupids Coral his net worth ( estimated ) is around 20million dollars
that outro music is legendary
Day 18 of saying YOUR MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER RYAN
Ryan is lawnist confirmed
ayo jupiter gang
Ryan has to edit his videos while his sleeping time so he has to be tired
ummm didnt he get reset by dr. mike last night or am i just confused?
At the end of ur video they show the top donation and as per my memory Paul Dotts was the top donar with 150000 or 200000 I can't remember the exact figure but can you explain 🤔
Each day you should put all of your money on a visa gift card before you check for the great reset.
didnt doctor mike  donate 100k? Why didn’t you get reset?
Grossi Posse let’s go
I seriously closed my eyes at 11:15 for a bit
Why did you not reset from doctor mikes donation? It has to be 50k exactly? The people want to know
I realy love what you're doing ❤️ ♥️ 💕
yooo tom grossi GPG!
now i’m mad i got invited to blues on the green but i got off work too late and i was tired 😭😭 life is full of regrets
I can't donate in my country yet
Ryan, NEVER talk about your "GamePlan" on the video Because people see when you are gonna be closer and RIGHT there AND THEN donate 50k.. Think about it.   #2
Ryan didn't say "Go Tigers"in the scratchy Ed Orgeron voice. Big sad.
Can we appreciate how kind and cool people are 👏
He got reset
Pauld dodds just left the leader board after day 16, something happened...but what was it?
Are you going to florida if you go there great money making methods.
Guys i think that Ryan is cheating cuz how is he charging his phone bro?? Tell me
When you where walking the dog you should get the collar out of under its legs it’s just easier to control the dog and not as uncomfortable for him, that’s all:) great video!
yo ryan what is your outro
Brandon look Green hahahah
yooo isaac love ur content
Please don’t walk backwards with lawnmowers. Safety first. Don’t want you to lose a foot and not be able to finish the challenge.   **Crisis averted while typing you’ve returned the lawn mower.**
Didn't you get reset? or GREAT RESET?!?!?
This man is starting to look like logan paul and it scares me
Still so proud of you for doing all this! You're amazing and I can never. Plus the fact that you turn this into a whole charity is awesome. (It is my birthday, I am currently trying to convince my parents to donate some money)
The extra Uber Gas Bonus was for your Chipotle and McDonalds "fuel" 😀.
some big ants...
Did anyone else notice that Paul Dodds just disappeared? Like what happened there?
What are you doing with the stuff you bought after the 30 day’s?
I love tabasco sauce I use in all hotgos I do lol
the front wheels on the lawn mower were about to fall off
Bros making an army against MrBeast😂
Hah, shopify you goofy bi-
yo I am a og I have been loving all  the vids
buy lots of water bottles then once u get enough sell them all for $2 it really good idea plz try it
Go Ryan go
Question... the rule is all prophet must come from the penny so how is getting jobs count i thought selling waters was cool :/
Hey Ryan please eat a fruit or a veg …I haven’t seen you eat one and it’s getting worrying👏🏾
What happens to the money you have after the great reset?
Crazy how he hasn’t used the restroom in 18 days
Hashtag f### mrbeast
Did you really think mowing lawns would work? Maybe if you were 12 or under.
its so hard not to smile right now  best thing i've ever heard from ryan
Just a tip for dogs the owner of Jupiter was not a good owner because dogs can easily break there leg when having there leash under it should be above the dog FYI
I have a question for Ryan Trahan where the all the extra money go when someone activate THE GREAT RESET?
you should buy a water bottle bec in most fast food places they let you fill it up for free then you won't have to buy water and you won't be dying of thirst like and repost if you agree pls give me credit tho if you repost
17:45, he looks like Isaiah photo
The cameraman should join
Olnly deliver Uber eats tomorrow so you can get enough for 95 tip
How is your phone charging bro?😳
i keep thinking hes gonna say "i got a feeling...... inside my bones
Ryan is the hardest YouTube worker  I have seen and my name is rayyan kinda Close to his name
Ryan you're almost there! Keep it up and i have a money making and genius idea: You can apply for a part time job getting paid and getting free food. Buy a suitcase that can be protected from the GREAT RESET, and it wiil be easy to move.
Isaiah is a YouTuber that tries to beat the rock in subscribers
For your next fun drink try Powerade + Sprite
Isaiah so goofy dude
we love jupiter
Bro on his way to MrBeast and now he is beefing with him I thinks this challenge is getting to his head
11:08 😨😰😱😱😱😱😱
Those ants thou just chillin😂😎
Hey, where did Paul Dodds go?
This series is so amazing, keep it up Ryan and crew! I hope ya'll hit 10 mill by the end ☺️
Yo Ryan I got another perfect fun drink for your Chipotle endeavors: 65% Mr. Pibb, 35% lemonade. So good 😌  ... anyone else do this..?
Ahh  pineapple.
Água fresca = fresh water

Paul Dodds missing again
Where is Paul dods
Rayan - " Oh gosh look at these huge ants" LMAO
I love seeing his videos every morning!!!
How are people tipping nothing or just $1
wher's Paul Dodds ?
W Patrick
Am i the only one who's face gets lit up when a new video is uploaded ❤️😄
Why is paul dodds not on the list of top donations?
New money making method: Do dares for money
7:50 Dude I'm not even joking we went to Chipotle a couple days ago and I decided to pour a lot of the tobasco sauce into a cup and drank it. I felt like I wan gonna keep over and die. I'm good with spiciness but dear lord please nobody drink their hot sauce. I got an excruciating headache and stomach ache.
chipotle should make a new burrito called the "Trahan Burrito"
Didn’t he get reset
I clicked this video as fast as I saw it Lol
Ay bro! Get that leash out of Jupiters pit!
Ryan had got more views than dude perfect in three hours 🤯
Did you do the lawn mower on a weekday?
I feel like fishing could be a could idea
Ryan is so brave doing this challenge. I would've quit first hour. Keep going Ryan
also i like how he is thanking the people for letting him mow their lawn XD
LETS GOOO SHOPIFYYYYYY LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
upgrade the total raised
bro i just realized that everytime i watched your vids i forgot to like it and its been 18 days and just now i realized i should like your vid.
what happened to paul dodds?
Why doesn’t it show Paul Dodd’s $150,000 donation at the end?
is nobody gonna talk about shopify
Jupiter is the best
for anyone asking, his song for the cutscenes is called orange mermalade, its good
EAT A VEGETABLE RYAN PLEASE
This man is brave still being able to film around ants that size, geez.
Those ants were terrifying. Loving this series!
eee
Good job on 1 billion views!
LETS GOOOOO
How does Ryan get cash if he’s getting paid on Uber eats digitally?
Nooo Ryhan forgot to slap the burrito
I like how the cameraman‘s balance was only zero dollars meaning Ryan doesn’t pay them
I love your content
Bro those ants are so scary ngl.
bro this man is ganna reach 10 million subs buy the end of this series
dude you're going to be so fit after this challenge.
I love these videos ! I’m gonna. Be sad when it’s over <\3
Soooo, do you just not go to the bathroom?
Every morning I just wake up watch and go shower
He is going to california
Not me watching Lego  Con and this at the same time 😂😂 But I literally thought hed drink that chili sauce.. lol
W
Not to be that guy but $29.13 + $20.20 is not $59.33 its $49.33 just saying lol
deskripsikan aku dalam satu kata
It’s crazy that 18 days ago Ryan had a single penny.       Now look at him
5:19 Ryan: Ima use my hands to get the extra big ones.. WHEN IMPOSTER IS SUS
Ryan I am such big fan I wish I could fly to you
AUR DIG
gotta admire ryan to have the courage to ask people to mow there lawns i even if he is nervous he does it for the  fundraiser appreciate his work
Gosh i love these videos!!! Best Series ever, but i wonder where do you charge your stuff? Just in MacDonalds or a public space or something Else ?☺️☺️
I love this series!!
Ryan gained 1mil subs in like 3 days , what an amazing series!!
yahh
what is the outro i love the song
I can’t believe you finally did the idea that I kept commenting
McDonald comes out with the “Ryan Trahan” meal. 😂
Ryan, y don't u do a part time job, McDonald's is 16 buck an hour or more idk but it's a good idea for u to get some sort of money
how does he deliver?
I'm surprised you know the Grosse Posse
At this point McDonalds should pay him-
You may make more money delivering at night. People tend to spend more on dinner.   Sad to see the $0 and $1 tips.   I just want MOOOORE OF THIS SERIES! 15-20 minutes a day is not enough!
If you buy noodles you still have food if there is a GREAT RESET
You should get a bank account so you can save ur money
jupiter gang!
Spock watching this be like 👁👄👁
You’re wild for not putting the hash brown on the sandwich
Invest some into stocks that way you it can’t get reset and you might make some money as well
does anyone know where paul dodds went?
RYAN YOU SO CRAZY!!!!
You should live stream a episode one day
Should have bought a bike lock and just return it like the ice chest.
Doordash has weekly bonuses too that are way more like $200 per weekend
Tom Grossi 🐐🐐🐐
guys what happened to Paul Dodds in the leaderboard?
17:43 Bro that is the most funniest stance u have ever made
Oh god it hurt me so much watching you keep stalling the engine bit I love the grind😭
Let's get ryan to 10 million subscribers before this series comes to an end. Honestly, Ryan deserves this for all his hard work! It's so crazy to think how he has managed to actually raise almost 8 million meals in such a short period of time. Way to go Ryan!  You can do this!
I would die for Jupiter
Why does everyone hate on broccoli is good
Shopify with the memelord donation, nice
Love what you’re doing here Ryan but you forgot to put Paul Dodds as the top of the Donations list.
Those ants almost great reset Ryan’s life 😟
Tbh it was kinda obvious it wasnt gonna work
day 18 of trying to get noticed
Not Fatherless 👍
Ryan you should stop exposing your plans in this
Loving the series but please eat some proper food sometime soon >.<
What happened to paul dodds?
Keep up the great work ryan
This man really just walked the dog for 30 min with the leash under the dogs leg... 🤦‍♂️😅
its so crazy to think that he is recording a video and is trying to survive as we speak 😂
Watch out Ryan, I smell a...GREAT RESET coming.
Everyone say, "Screw Paul Dodds." What a pos human..
The next city will be either Atlanta, Jacksonville or New York i bet
Why did Paul Dodds disappear from the top donations list?
On the next hash brown you need ketchup!!
what the fuckedsd lmaooo nice video
Ryan, you should make a video where you get 100 youtubers and race across america starting from 1 penny. Whoever get from california to north carolina first wins. Just a suggestion! Love the series!!
Omg just by mentioning shopify in hus vid they donated 69,420 dollars Also i see what the did with the first 2 numbers i would like uf the did it with the last 2 as well
Wait, what happened to thje guy who donated 150k?
bro what happened to mr. dodds?
The Tik TOK segments when he had the lawnmower/was pulling weeds was comedy gold ☠️
Bro 19 and 20 dollars is 39 dollars
For me this is. a “nightly routine “
Omg I actually thought he found big ants but then he shows them😭😭
14:16
Wait, how do you charge your phone???
Shouldve gone to a place like Chicago or maybe St.Louis to cut lawns much more grass especially by O’Hare
This is the best series on YouTube! I live your videos. Keep up the great work!!!
I'm losing my mind over the fact he never fixed the leash. Damn thing was in between the dogs legs the whole time
what happened to paul dodds? where’d his donation go?
Hola.
I’m hoping for the great rest to come
Near to 10M
watch 10:18, ryan ur sus
At this point I've really been wondering how he charges his phone.
?  why never kfc
I am embarrassed that I knew what he was gonna say before he fully said the Moana joke. 💀
I AM LITERALLY SCREAMING AT MY PHONE WATCHING THIS YOU HAVE A BICYCLE YOU CAN PULL THE LAWN MOWER WITH THE BICYCLE EVERY KID THAT'S 14 DOES THAT!! ALSO WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GET A WALLET OH YEAH QUIT BANGING YOUR STRAWS ON THE TABLE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PEEL THE PAPER AWAY YOU CAN DAMAGE THE STRAW AND THEN IT'S NO GOOD IF YOU KEEP BANGING IT.

You could always buy sunscreen Ryan it would help
I just won the lottery I got 1 million I smell great reset for you
ARE YOU IN THR FUTER?????!!??!!?!!!???
I can believe Ryan actually survived those ants they were huge
Jupiter is a good boi
This series inspired me to start trying to earn money -- earned 40$ selling water today outside😎 Thanks Ryan!
convert your money to a card so you can save up
Loved the chaotic energy today. Ryan was totally being a menace to society with that burrito interview.
He just said wak instead of walk (no hate)
Very good series can you do a canada vid please 👍🏻?
Where is Paul Dodds
Isn't Paul Dodds the biggest donator?
What happened to Paul Dodds?
Ryan, a little tip is try to only do the Uber eats orders that are higher tips. I saw you only got a $2 earning on one order because the person didn’t tip at all so you only got the fees. Great work though for sure!!
y isnt paul dodds at the top? its dr.mike with  only 100,111
Ryan got me addicted to their iced coffees again.
Didn’t doctor mike donate 100000$ yesterday
I'm going to be mad if he goes to Missouri cause Im on vacation in Michigan right now 😃
Wheres Paul dodds?
This is awesome, but more like how to survive with only a cell phone + unlimited data
Love The Great Reset pose all the time!
Ryan is not only a part of my daily routine, he's also the best part of my daily routine!❤
Bro needs some alo vera
hiii
What happened to Paul Dodds?????????
The cameo by Isaiah though!
I will never forget when Ryan said ,” ayo jupiter gang……. Ayo Uranus
:o
I think you should put more money on other gift cards tbh. Good luck! I love this series
is no one gonna talk about the fact the paul dodds isn't the top donor anymore? prob just an editing mistake.
i unsubscribed then resubscribed to help him out
"Romcom where the deliverer meets his match"  I think Haley's going to need to talk to you a second time!
18:27 he got scared af😭 I actually think you are very "generous"🖖
I love Isaiah photo
Wait didn't he get reset by Dr. Mike yesterday?
Did y'all see that the 3rd top donation is spotify with $69,420.
Where do u use the bathroom?
What happened to paul dodds ???
Yo it is my b day tomorrow I am so excited
I can’t believe that I was here before one mill
@Ryan, you know how to mow! Too bad more peeps didn’t take you up on it.
Y pay for cup at Chipotle
How does he use the bathroom????????????
i know it’s hard because I cut grass and get rejected a lot and i mean a lot but i still go and just make the most of it :)
This man always tries to do something and extra ordinary and make his audience fell excited for every next, love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jesus is the only thing that is perfect
Bro if i see you in north carolina ima have a heart attack i live in apex catch me in a grave first second me make eye contact
id love if you recorded being involved in the process of the meals being made and/or delivered?
Xkxoox
Goofy ahh ants
Sosoos
Sksosos
Ososos
No worrys pal
That dude who paid the cameraman… respect🥹
Get a visa gift card!!!!
Screw the great reset
Ryan when u left ur ur bike outside u should have taken it to the gym to keep safe
Yo did Paul Dobbs refund the money he donated? He’s not on the end card anymore
Listen, the video is a banger, but the end I just smile because u raised so much money and the song keeps the vibe in bound
I am just taking my lawn mower for a walk
You don't know what an alkali is? It's the opposite of an acid. Surely it can't have been that long ago you went to school that you forgot what an alkali is.
YOU ROCK
He gonna get reset the next day 😭😭
I started eating McDonald's for every meal too so I can be as fit as you 🔥
Jupiter #1 i Wonder where IS the other dogs? Like the sun or earth maybe pluto even
Ok that ants part was actually funny  Well atleast for mee
Probably he got asked that several times but I did not see any answer: Why is he paying so much money to MC Donalds when it is proven that their food is unheathy, doesnt taste good and is on top too expensive? I dont get it. Do they want to buy these meals at mc Donalds so that the inhabitants of America get fatter and fatter (if that is even possible)?  Please tell me your game plan!
where is Paul dotts
We should get chipotle to name his burrito after him for all he has done.
bruh shopify legit donated $69,420
Dude why not keep walking dogs?
Ryan should sell ice cream since it’s so hot out
If this dude doesnt get on rewind man I’m going to be mad
We love Jupiter
yo isaiah photo is in this lol
Me and my brother are really wanting to try the burrito concoction lol. We are going to try it in the next few days
where did Paul Dodds donation go?
For the delivery, he should wait until the next day before redeeming in case of the great reset
Ryan pls don’t just directly go to North Carolina because I could really use some content and because people might donate more later
not mow money mownie
If this dude doesn’t get on the rewind I’ma be fuming
When I watch your vids my day gets better keep up the good work Ryan your content is amazing
Its amazing how he has done this with a penny
YOU WERE HERE OMG!
7$ ooo
Lol
What about house cleaning
Should have asked around if anyone needs their lawn mowed before getting the lawn mover. Love this series either way!
SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED TO PAUL DODDS!!! WHY IS HE GONE?
Didn't see apul Dodds at the end
imagine if he won on both of the lottery tickets
Turdboi420 at the end lol
If only he was coming to Knoxville TN I'd love to run into this guy, he seems cool
Hey Ryan I'm from Germany and your Videos are my after noon Routine. I love it❤😊
I know it's a bit late now but a basket for the bike would have been a better investment than the mower rental...lol
what surveys does he use for money?
On my time zone, he posts at 11pm. sleep sched wrecked. but vid defenitely worth watching even the whole series.
Does Dr Mike’s donation not trigger a great reset?
Anyone realize Ryan got reset last night, but didn't start at one penny today?
What else am I gonna watch when this finishes
Anyone Else Wondering Where Is Paul Dodds In The Leaderboard
When I look at how much Shopify donated
E
70k in ONE DAY?!
People really not tipping on big orders 💀
Spray peoples house numbers to make money 👏🏽
edit it
everyone subscribe ryan is so close to 9 milion subscribers
The fact the Lawn mowing busing was a fail also shows that when your business fails, it’s just part of life and you have to move on to something else. Making mistakes is acceptable.
The outro music
19:47 - Did Paul Dodds pull his $150k donation or something as his names gone?
This dude makes me wake up motivated for the day. Ending this series is going to be sad.
I’m from Louisiana and I loved when u bought that shirt because YouTubers never talk about Louisiana or anything like that
McDonald's, Chipotle and Uber eats better sponsor my theater boiiii
Shopify gigachad.
Why doesn’t he try buying a train
One question is that what happened to Paul dodds wasn't he the top donator
Ryan's hair looking extra yellow and extra curly today. 😊
Why you only eat mcdonalds bro shits gross
#**c*MrBeast 🤣🤣🤣
5:51 🥲❤️
You look like drew dirksen
Hey ryan. Heads up, I’m going to donate £50,000 very, very soon
It kinda bothers me that Jupiter’s leash was around their right front leg, and idk why.
Anyone wonder how he charges his phone?
2024: ‘i survived on $0.01 for a year and gave it to my Japanese friend’
17:43 best one yet
idk if its still a thing but cant u get free flights by just hanging around the airport and waiting to see if theres extra room on the plane ?
I legit started panicking when he said there r giant ants
Ummm what happened to paul dodds
Shopify with the 69 420 nice
Next challenge for Ryan-eat a combined 7 fruits and veggies daily for a month.
Oh yeah Tom Grossi Go Pack Go
PUT THE HASHBROWN IN THE SANDWICH (trust me its good)
when did we pass half way (day count)
to be honest I don’t really think the surveys should count because they technically don’t come from that one penny
mowerman
Put the hashbrown in the breakfast sandwich next time it’s amazing
Nice to see another youtuber “Izaiah Photo” to be in a video.   Ryan hope you have a great adventure tomorrow. Can’t wait!
I wonder where does he charge his phone
The guy at 17:28 looks really familiar, but I can't remember his name. Is he a youtuber?
Ryan acting like he doesn’t have to go back for the camera every time he walks out of the shot
What happened to Paul Dodds being the top donation?
I’m surprised that Ryan has not mentioned that he has to get 3 tattoos
Imagine hitting 10million subs on day 30 That would be insane! We can do it guys. 1mil to go we have 12 days i think we can reward ryan for what he was doing for this amazing series!
Hi
The last thing ryan needs is a great reset
Wow lol
What happened to Paul Dodds.. or what ever his name was.  He isn't on the list anymore?
Sell ice pops
Almost 9 million subs let’s go!!!
he could also just have asked them to borrow their own lawnmower instead of buying his own but oh well
Yoo Mate, Brandon has to sleep sometimes. Thats a lifehack against eyesacks
can't wait to day 29
Bro you need to eat something else. This is ridiculous at this point. Your body is crying
Why there wasnt a great reaset becose Doctor mike donated a 100. 111
Yea turdboi420 gang!
Shoutout to the dude who paid the cameraman
Yo, Ryan. Big fan of this series. But honestly tho, don't change the music for when u get chipotle. The original was better. Hope it's back to normal tomorrow :)
Isaiah?
how dos he charch his phone
Someone needs to donate $49,999.99
She said your speechless
Ryan should buy something for $100 and if the GREAT RESET happens then he can sell it in the morning
My brother went and played in a band for LSU back when he was in college
What is the yellow hat in the bottom?
People say it's part of there morning it's 3 o clock went it is out
Every time Ryan slaps his burrito. Us:😀Haley: 🤬
Ryan is pog that's all I can say
i think this series would be more entertaining if great resets could be triggered in the middle of the day
Dude my man your cheating on Spock
My guy will have 11M subs by the end of the series
Keep up the good work ryan!!
AAH WHY DID I STAY TO LOOK AT THE ANTS I AM SHAKING OF TERROR
How do you edit ur vids?
Where’s Paul dods
We have to make Ryan’s chipotle a trend were people try it!
ep 19! chant
It's really funny taht @Jacksucksatlife is sitting in the top donation list as turdboi420
Iasiah chooses paper
I’ve been six months sober from McDonald’s and daaamn these videos are making hard no to go 😭
Are we going to talk about the 2 guys in the background at 1:39 lol. Idk why but it's funny to me.
The last page of the name thingy at the end of the video has turdboi420 on it.
He got reset yestarday but he was on 26$ at starting weird. 🤔🤔
RYAN WHAT HAPPEND TO PAUL DODS WHERE IS HE U HAVE BEEN QUIET ABOUT HIM

I feel like ryan's legs must be ripped, because i cant bike more then 10km's before i need to take a full days break or more lol, also those ants be h u g e
Go get it Ryan, you got this!
Holy those ants
I’m confused someone donated 100k how is that not a great reset is it only if it is 50k?
You should buy lottery trickets so if you get reset you have some chance of getting it back
Please tell me the name of the song at the end of every video,from day 1 igot that song stuck in my head please tell me
Ryan, trust me my name is Ryan too and I get the same burrito but with queso. You have to try it
Ryan is 10% water, 30% iced vanilla coffee, 30% mcchickens, and 30% chipotle
The ants haha
Hi
Am I the only one that was hoping he got a great reset so this series doesn’t end too quick? 😭
This is so cool it's almost unreal
Bro getting error 1005  Access denied  😂😂     While donating
should have gone to a ritcher neighbourhood to mow lawn... am I right?
What happened to Paul Dodds Donation? Did I miss something that happened previously?
Mate, please invest in a high spf sunscreen and eat some veggies. I am getting worried for you. Look after yourself before helping others.
I really hope he doesn’t skip South Carolina 😫🥲
the chaos of the interviews at the end of the vid is giving me life rn HAHAH
Gives me ocd how the dogs leash is up it’s armpit and it’s a simple 2 second fix
Where did Paul Dodds Donation go??
I bet I couldn’t last 1 minute
The ants 😭😭😭
Lesssgo , Doctor Mike ✨
WHAT- ASPARAGUS IS LITERALLY THE BEST
Since you are in texes you maybe should sell water because its hot there and people would maybe would want water there! Just an idea you can do, you don't have to do it though
Ryan always makes my day
Everyone subscribe when u see this comment plus it's the least u could do to help!!! :)
You got this Ryan! New goal : Get to 10 million subscribers before the end of this series  Been watching ever since day 1

Looks like your having a “great time”
What happened to Paul Dodd’s???
For “mow” money. Quality content.
The ants bit genuinely made me laugh
Why don’t you buy a visa gift card? You should to protect your money from the “GREAT RESET”.
WHAT COFFE IS THAT?
I just dont want you to keep getting reset.
good morning
Hey I'm here when it was released 5 minutes ago. Get wrecked ppl that started this series in 2024

The lawn mower cost more than the car lmao

Wow Ryan got me with the ants..
Shopify with the 69420 that's funny
🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶
THOSE ARE SOME REAAAAAAAALLY BIG ANTSSSS BROOOOOO 🐜

that's a nice m3 in the first house, guy was super nice too. I wonder if he uses turn signals
ryan gotta win the lottery
JUBIDER :D
Great series, but anyone else think the survey app shouldn't be allowed because all profit has to come from the penny?
Ryan: Describe me in one word Me: Short
as always still great everyday

Don't mess with Maui when he's on a break-away And the tapestry here on my skin  Is a map of the victories win  Look where I've been  I make everything happen  Look at that mean mini-Maui just tickety-tappin'  (Ha ha ha ha ha ha, hey)  Well, anyway let me say, "You're welcome" (you're welcome)  For the wonderful world you know Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome (you're welcome) Well, come to think of it, I gotta go (hey)  Hey, it's your day to say, "You're welcome" (you're welcome)  'Cause I'm gonna need that boat I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome (you're welcome)  'Cause Maui can do anything but float  (You're welcome)  You're welcome  (You're welcome)  You're welcome  And thank you
Hey Ryan not sure if you will keep knocking doors but here’s a pitch that will help you land customers way faster. “ hi my name is Ryan, I’m just out here taking care of a couple neighbors lawns ( name drop any customers) doing it for super cheap since I’m already here. (Wait for them to respond) if they say what’s cheap there’s a 70/30 chance you’ll sell them. If they are not interested just say hey man seriously I’m doing the whole lawn for $20 bucks and pray haha
Where is paul dodds
I really don’t want this series to end and this charity was a amazing idea and this series is so much fun too
Great job
What!!!! I think i have never seen this big AnTs
bro where did paul dodds go
where did paul dods go? he no longer the number one doner
$3.15 bonus for gas
I was dying of laughter when Ryan showed the *BIG ANTS* which it actually was just a sculpture.
Ayo where does Paul Dodds donation gone huh ?
Can we talk about the beautiful romantic music when Ryan is getting his Chipotle burrito
Who is out here tipping 1 dollar 🙃 there are some sorry folks in this world
Never Ask: A man his salary A woman her age Ryan Trahan where he goes to the toilet
From 7M to 9M
Hey wait a second couldn't you order for yourself and then get a bonus? AND the food?
I love how Isaiah photo is the vid like he ain’t even a special guest?😂😂

Man those ants are big
Love the videos
Jeez, if there was a great reset tonight, u would've been screwed.
I don’t know how he carry’s the Uber order and the camera and drive the bike one hand without a basket
I can only see 2 more days than I have to wait 13 days have a successful time I will log in on my phone but It won't be the same Also would you like me to donate $50,000 daily?
hope mcdonalds sponsors you king
1:40 He probably got a copyright strike.
Money.    💵💵💵💵💵💵💴💴💴💴💴💴💶💶💶💶💶💶💷💷💷💷💷💷💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💳💳💳💳💰💰💰💰💰
Wait what happened to Paul dods donations. He was number 1.
Ryan when you finish this challenge do the same challenge but  in Canada because it the weather will make it much harder for you to survive and I now you will not finish this challenge p.s love your vids
When Ryan gets reset what does he do with the money, does he donate it, or keep it for him self personally?
Keep the chipotle cup drink that’s you don’t have to pay every time
what mic is that
Bro what happened to Paul Dods
4:12 that hand shake tho
.
When you get a rental car  get a uhaul.
Don’t read my name
I got nothing to say
1 hr 40 mins ago be like
basically if no one great resets him for the next 2 days or 3 , he can get a plane ticket to n carolina and basically finish the challenge . AND ALSO , DAY 19 OF ASKING WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE SONG IN THE OUTRO??
what happenned to paul doods on the top doners
Ryan: "Describe me in one word" Video:  *Cuts*
what happened to paul dodds
The amount of people who order uber eats and leave ZERO TIP or $1 tip is mind blowing. Shame on you, i always leave zero tip and then surprise them with a cash tip that way no taxes from uber or the government!! they think they getting burnt then i hook them up with a $5
Imagine if Dad watches him eat McDonals rn
Facial hair going craazyy.
Hi the game plan
Toro> Jupiter
This is one of the longest videos in the series, much more fun
Open a bank account so u get protected from the GREAT reset 💀 💀
I have a big question that in us is there cold that u drink coffee as coffee is mostly drank on cold days and in summers it is the tea that replaces coffee. thanks from India. please reply please.
17:08 the girl on the right (but from her POV the one on the left) looks a lot like that girl on tik tok that dresses up as Padmè Amidala
LLL=W
I think at the end of this 1 penny challenge someone will do video like 'every time when Ryan slap burrito'
you already know day 29 or 30 someones gonna donate 5k lol
Feel bad for Dylan, man donated 50k at the wrong time and didn’t activate a reset
I am a fan of chipolate now
Those ants gave me a fright
1:40 omg I sang this song at my graduation 😭

Ryan would be one of those people whom I'd love to meet if I visit the States.
GROSSI POSSI PACKERRR NATION
Let's go rayan
If you get a plane ticket to Concord NC at 11:31 AM on Wednesday on American Airlines I will be on that plane (I’m going back home from vacation)

Who else noticed that Paul Dodds is no longer on the donations at the end?
didnt he got resest cause of the 100k donation
3:59 that bark was so loud 😂
omg lol youtube unsubbed me
Shopify W🗿
I wish Canada's large iced coffees were that big. Our large is like half that size
Bro Andrew really gave you a $0 tip. What a jerk.
You should go to Walmart and flip some of the clearance items on Amazon. You can also hold onto them for a great reset
In Oregon it’s “Music on The Greens”
Howdey
Today was Ryan’s favorite day yet I think
what are we going to do  when this ends?
or lemonade sprite and a little bit of mountain dew
Yoooo I love Isaiah photos shorts!!!
Why Paul Dodds donation is not there anymore.Did he took his money back or what ????
But where did Paul Dobbs donation for $150k go?
It's. My bday
LMAO SPOPIFYS DONATION 69,420
watch ryan hit 10 mil by th e end of this
He has to be geeked
ryan you can buy visa cards so you still technically have money after a reset
I'll pay you $20 to mow my lawn. Only instead of that you have to eat a fruit or vegetable.
Cool
i put in lemonade sprite and fanta
ryan you can buy visa cards so you still technically have money after a reset
Wait didn't Dr Mike reset him
ryan you can buy visa cards so you still technically have money after a reset
omg. i was in that same ant area one week ago. ILYSM RYAN
If you are in North Carolina before Friday you should go to Greensboro college there is a camp going on and I would give you a 20 dollar donation
These videos have made me get a better morning routine and I think I will make one of the but in a smaller scale soon
When did he reset his money
I think you should get lottery  tickets  you might win 500$ 1000$ or 10000$
I mean Togo > Jupiter change my mind
Why is your money not reset
@Ryan Trahan  You should donate your leftover money to feeding America
What will Spock think about Toro and Jupiter
He has gained 1m subs
I don't see how this man has survived on only chipotle and Mcdonalds for 18 days straight
The ants😂
What is this that your doing to us, we're all just getting hooked to this series!! Netflix who?
Just imagine Ryan get's all that way and Jimmy isn't home.
i dont think the city is crazy i think you get crazy from the city
Yesterday when I was at Mc Donald’s and I ordered a chicken sandwich and 20 piece mc nuggets, but when I got back to the house, they decided to give me 4 mc nuggets
Lawn mower L
I love your videos🎥
how are the surveys coming from the penny? and the door dashes? you didn’t buy the phone with a penny so the money isn’t coming from the penny
When he said “what is the takeaway” I was just waiting for it. 😂🤦‍♂️🥲
Ryan let’s go
hi!
W again
You definitely love Hamilton the musical you started singing a song to Moana and the music is made by the creator of Hamilton
We get one of these every day? I feel spoiled.
He is my Evening rountean
I love how much Spotify gave to the great cause
There’s no way it takes you more then 8 bites to eat that hash brown 😭
U edit on pc or mobile?
HAHAHAHAHA DONT MESS WITH MAUI
I live in North Carolin
Is it bad that I’m going to be completely distraught when he finally hands off a penny to MrBeast?
At the end of the day you gotta invest your earnings into a sellable product. I fear a great reset is COMMING
Describe Ryan in one word!    Handsome
Wtf happened to Paul Dodds 150,000$ donation, isn't he top donator
Yes sir
Bro I was at blues on the green
The Great Reset
You are the best
wher dos the monny go when he  gets ther grate reset
I'm a tad bit confused about Paul Dodds. He was the top donor until today, where is name just isn't on the donation list at the end. Did something happen?
Good morning America From me in Asia :)
What am I going to do if he delivered the penny. I hope you make a new series like this its so much fun
Bro shopify with the $69420 donation 👀
Why didn't he do the great reset doctor Mike donated $100,111
For the people who looked away from the huge ants........they were terrifying
Sell the bike
Ryan got me with the huge ants
You should have asked Isaiah his thoughts on The Rock LOL
You have gotten so far into this series
Lets go brandon
Can we get q&a after the end of this series?
Ryan, you should got to Jollibee and buy  the pineapple juice and some spaghetti :)  You can do it Ryan!!
grats on 9 mill subs bro  you got 1.5 mill in 18 days
Thank you for mowing my lawn I really appreciated it!
Sell the bike
Wait where's Paul Dodds in the outro?
14:33 an angel's voice.. 𓆩😌𓆪 😳✨ ~      & good luck on the series, ryan!
The fundraiser is 300k away from raising 1 million dollars!
day 18 , "cinematic mode" new item unlocked
Cinematic Jupiter peeing experience
Ryan you need to buy airline igft cards
Shopify with the $69,420 😎😂
isaiah photo showing up legitamately shocked me and i have no idea why
You could also sell the bike like a day before getting a plane ticket in case your a bit short. As I don’t think you can take it on the plane. Also keep on trying hard!
ryan u should buy a water bottle instead so u dun hv to pay for water. maybe buy fruit flavor powder too as investment
How does the digital payment, to cash work? Do you go to an atm behind the scenes? Do you Venmo the money to the camera guy, and he gives you cash?
Spok is gonna be mad
you should spray paint house dresses on curbs for money.
ryan you can buy visa cards so you still technically have money after a reset
Hi
I’ll bet Ryan gets to 10M subscribers by the time this is all said and done.
last day there was a great reset...
How does this guy always have clean clothes
Morning routineee✨
you should make an incentive if someone donates 200k in one donation u get THE GREAT GREAT RESET, where u start with only a penny and have to give up your whole inventory, maybe, idk
This makes me want a chipotle burrito every time
i think they sell bike locks at the dollar store.
I’m gonna start riding my bike around my neighborhood with the biking music 😂
Have you checked YouTube donations for any 50,000 donations?
Even the survey app thinks that Ryan eats to too much chipotle and McDonald’s lol 😂
Hey! What happened with Paul Dodds (Dots? Dodts? I don't remember lol)?
I bet he can't do all of this in India or any 3rd world country for that matter.
Does anyone know what the song is at the end?
I love yoooouuu
Where is Paul dodds donation at?
Turns out Ryan won the lottery but someone hit the great reset on him so he had to throw away the lottery money
where's paul dods his 150k not showing in the end
only if u started a little later could of came to omaha for the college world series🤙🏼
Congratulations  10M  In advance🦋🦋🦋🥀🥀🥀🥀
Anybody know the name of the survey app he’s using?
Why isnt Paul Dotts 150.000 Dollars on the end screen anymore?
1 question , where did paul dodds go ? didnt he donated 150k ?
Everyone’s saying this series is a morning routine for them. Bro it’s a night routine for me in Australia 🇦🇺 2:28am rn
Hash browns on the breakfast sandwich next time , makes the sandwich complete ! Lol  Love you’re hard work , talking to people is not easy at first , through your journey’s I’ve seen you morph into a people person ! Bravo my young Lad . You should be a inspiration to this younger generations to get past fears in life of interacting with people in today’s society . You are what I was 30 + years ago now without the cameras ! Much respect my young guy , keep doing what inspires you . 🤙🏻💯
Where is Paul Dodds
The end song is so catchy
11:18 bruh I got tricked
I agree moana is a great movie
whenever  the cash meter goes up its just so satifysing
Wow does Ryan ever read his comments??
ryan i honestly need an answer where did paul dodds donations go
Bro what kind of dog is that  XD
Why don't you get a train ticket
Almost 9 million, wooh wooh! Let’s go Ryan!
Awesome 🤩 👌
16.55 bro lost a 5 pound note or somthing.
where did paul dodds go
This series is crazy I'm watching from June 1st and now it's June 18 and it's my birthday this video is my gift
ending the day with $102.15 ... yeah The Great Reset is coming lol
LOL like the ants
Wow, he is the most awkward jacked guy I've ever seen!
What if you combine dog walking with uber deliveries?  You earn twice as much in like half of the time! Enjoying your vids, Charly
As someone who mows lawns for a job I would pay Ryan to do the job for him so he would stop
I dont wanna be rude but 19+20 is not 29 and 29+20 is not 59
17:44 you just see Isaiah's hand like. Tf?
"hasbroown~"
Kudos to all your brilliant money making ideas! You'll never be broke and it really shows us how someone can go from $.01 to enough to keep profiting. Helps that you're an American looking poster boy with gorgeous curls and a smile to kill! Being good looking helps but your personality is 💯 bomb diggity and everyone can become your friend! Don't stop!! Keep going to many countries!!
What happened to Paul Dobbs 150K donation? it doesn’t show up anymore
9:48 Ryan discovered cinematic mode
Didn't he get reset by doctor mike
ALMOST AT 9M SUBS
When Ryan's morning routine is disappearing-😭😭
Where did Paul Dodd’s donation go?
dude I think you really need some sun block your sunburn is looking really bad
Get a visa gift card and put most money on there to protect it from great reset.
im not really that early but I came back earlier than ur dad
YOU GOT THIS BO WE ALL HAVE TOUGHT TIMES
dude the wheel on that mower is fucked
why is this such a vibe
When he said ant
Nice!
One of the best thing about this dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something. He always repect us, The audience and his team and he is polite in all his videos. We congratulate ourselves on this achievement more to come❤.......
Hey ryan, wondering what happened to paul dodds
Ryan do you even knock on the doors when you deliver on door dash????
Almost 9 million subscribers congratulations!
you shoud get pokemon cards
Buy things in large stock then sell them individually
TAKE MULTIVITAMINS
The amount of dog walkers must’ve sky rocketed by now
I've made Ryan a part of my nighttime routine, just for the sake of being unique. :) Love your vids my friend. <3
I have now ant phobia😭😭😭
Good morning :)
Ryan I wondered if you bought something small and kept it in your pocket that is worth a decent amount of money, then once THE GREAT RESET happens you can keep the receipt and return it to the store for exchange for some money. Also I love watching your content, I enjoy watching it everyday. I know you can do it.
Ryan could literally do deliveries all day and I wouldn’t be bored
where is the paul dodd's donation?
What happened to Paul Dodds?
I got a burrito today, and first thing I thought was slap it
the timelapse for mowing was so satisfying
@Mcdonald should literally donate 100k plus actual meals or something
You should buy maruchan (Mexican soup). It’s good and it’s only 50 cents!!!! You only need water and a microwave. Buy it at your local grocery store.
instead of doing uber eats, just do uber and take people for rides on your bike.
LOVE U RYAN!!!!!!!!
Who else doesn't want the series to end? I have an Idea, Ryan if you are seeing this if someone donates 100,000 you should try to get home with just one penny.
I have been watching MrBeast for about 6 years
what happened to Paul Dodds donation tho?
You should buy a airline gift card and put some money at a time
Yes!! Good job shopify, thank you for donating that glorious number
When the camera man got $2.50, it was like a second player joined the game. Love the series, keep it up!
great reset tomorrow
What happened to the $150k in donations/tattoo request guy? I don’t see his donations anymore or have seen any mention of him in awhile. Dodds was his name I think.
How are you gonna travel with a bike?
elon musk does a great reset 😳
IDEA ryan should buy a coffee cup big enough to fit a large iced coffee from McDonalds. Thoughts?
Ryan I saw your video its amazing and your challenge are amazing my flowing and your joke is so good and  ryan i get u 86 subscribe and I want to get u more subscribe
I subscribed 🫶
Next series be like  "Dilevering a penny to PewDiePie a cross the world" 😆 Since PewDiePie is in Japan
Ily
Sayy
What happened to Paul Dodds’ donation?
Goodmorning my friend ✌🏻🤙🏻
Watching this before your birthday is amazing. Ryan is helping so many people that are facing hunger, if I was able to donate I will because those many people need food for them to eat. Ryan is always entertaining us with new videos every day/week and it becomes a routine to which I’m watching him every day.
RYAN GET A METAL DETECTOR AND SELL WHAT YOU FIND!!
17:41 THE GREATEST *THE GREAT RESET* definitely didnt saw that coming lol
Keep up the grind ryan
When do you charge your phone I’m just wondering 💭
Anyone wonder why paul dodds isnt the top donor anymore? Where is he?
Ryan, you should buy a gift card for an airline as a safety net that way all the hard work you put in doesn’t go as a loss for the great reset!
what happened to paul dodds donation of 150k
Bro wtf where did paul dodds go?
Not gonna lie some of those door dash tips were disrespectful
After these many videos it's time for MC Donalds to donate.
Ryan a tip on the dog walking if you always walk them on the kerb or the road it can damage their nails so they will enjoy it much more on grass!
Ryan you are the best
I think that Jupiter did not like your shirt 😂😂😂😂
Felt your pain with the lawnmowing. 🙃 Your resilience is inspiring.
Does anyone know why Paul Dodds disappeared from the donations?
Hmmm I think that Brandon kid might be a zombie walking around inconspicuously.
I have been watching Ryan for 2 years now and his videos just keep getting better and better ❤😊
Good singing I guess😃😇
You should get a app that pays you to walk
Ayo shopify donate 69,420 respect my guy
Love the vids. Be careful with the gift card. You should probably use cash instead unless you have to.
Ello
i think ryan is wrong for the title of the video . The title : I eat Mcdonald and burito for 30 day
Dont mess with ryan when hes on a break away
You should have put a post on a website when you were mowing lawns
Love you Ryan you are amazing 🤩
You are amazing this series is amazing, it makes my day. every day i wake up and cant wait to see the video from that day. 👍👍👍👍👍
This guy excudes such a positive energy that lifts everyone spirits
Hi Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
This video made my waffles better.
day 20 is my birthday:)
hey ryan the editor messed up when you got 20 for the first lawn he maid it say 29.9 when its supose to be 39.9 and its also was 10 dollars off for the rest of the video
Hey, whatsup with the paul dodds donation? was it fraud or smthing? why isn't it there on the list in the endcard? anyone else curious about that?
Are you making sure the pups pups don't get burned in this heat?
16:47 was the best part 😆
Ryan's content is getting worse. LET ME EXPLAINNN. Ok so the first video of the series was pretty fun to watch since he was trading from a penny. Now...he's kinda living a normal life and I can say that I've been camping for 2 weeks straight and it was harder than what Ryan's doing right now. The reason I feel like posting this comment is cause he's getting a lot more from views then one might expect
Ryan:I love you Jupiter Haily:😠😯😡
I've been watching since the start of the penny vids, and btw, the ants just got me! 😂 X
YouTube did not recommend
when he falls to sleep dose he feel bugs or something
In love with this series
e
When you are in India so this becomes part of your night routine
BBQ
Woo

What happened to Paul dodds? His name disappeared for the list.
This is an amazing series 😌
Tom Grossi donated but I only have one thing to say to him.  Go BEARS
Ryan What do you do with the money that you lose when you get a great reset?
i have waited all night for this😭
How are you buying McDonald's for breakfast? If I were Dr. Mike, I'd be f****** pissed that you didn't do the great reset when I donated six figures! But seriously, why no great reset?
17:40 THE GREAT RESET
Shopify’s donation tho 😂😂

Not me hard core stressing at 18:39 when Ryan had over $100 and was about to check donations😰😳🫣😫😱… Glad there was no GREAT RESET 🕺🏼 in this vid 😅😂🤩

Imagine e him doing this for a year
Good morning heat wave how are you today? I was just wondering when you will be going on vacation again. I know that we have to wait until winter shows up but maybe you could give winter a call and ask her or him to come early. Thanks I appreciate that. Yes I know I am an idiot.
But Ryan got reset by doctor mike last night? I’m confused?
fun fact: There is actually a three day time difference between where Ryan is on a day, and the day the video releases. So on day 19 Ryan is going to get reset again.
How you got normal straws
I've said it before, and ill say it again, you should do "Around The World in 80 Days Starting With .01 USD"
9M today?
YEAAAA LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO LSUUUUU
Wait, he got donated 100,000$ yesterday doesnt that do the reset?
lol
I literally just clicked on this video when it had 378K views When I’m done it has 770K views Insane.

Moana, really? I got stitches because of a Moana play.
You are my favorite YouTuber
This guy is really inspirational and deserves a lot of praise for raising all this money!
what happened to paul dodds?
He suddenly discovering cinematic mode on his iPhone is so innocent and funny
honestly you have gained so much money and so many subscribers (im one of them) during this insane series
Can we just talk about that stache?
Ryan, you should get a prepaid visa and keep money on it
Ryan you could have stayed at utah and bought a ticket to Georgia it’s only $140
Interesting but what about me I survived almost whole my life on 0,00 cent
As a kid I always pulled the lawn mower behind my bike!
11:05. No tip Andrew. Shame !!!
U been extra gay the last two vlogs. And u gotta get rid of the bootie shorts
i have a money making idea you can be a maid for people you would probably make a lot of money
"And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life.  And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works.  Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." (REVELATION 20:12-15 NKJV)   Today, while you are still alive and able, may you repent from your sins, believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that JESUS CHRIST is your Lord and Savior, so that through Him, your name will be written in the Book of Life.    "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him  should not perish but have everlasting life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved." (JOHN 3:16-17 NKJV)   JESUS LOVES YOU. HE DIED FOR YOU. ✝️  Please do not ever forget that.
Hey
love your so much videos
Didn't Dr Mike reset you though since it was over 50k donation
for $1 ... but ryan spend more than $1 .. he spend $1.2
I just realized that Ryan has passed doctor Phil in about 2 million subs. let's make it 3 million and get Ryan to 10million subs
what is the servey app anyone ?
I LOVE THIS SERIES!!! You are an inspiration, Ryan!! I have watched every episode since last night & I’m hooked! I can’t wait for tomorrow!!!
Hey man I love what you are doing and I always watch your new video when I eat my breakfast you are doing something so nice
u should have had water stand in that concert
Why wasn’t there a great reset if someone donated $100K yesterday?
your hair screaming for some nutrients 😭
Just fyi, don’t walk dogs in the street cause they can get over 100°F and is extremely dangerous for their paws. It’s best to walk them in the grass/dirt when possible, then the sidewalk, and the street if absolutely necessary, in which case the amount of time they’re out on the street should be minimized
When Ryan doesn’t do a border 2-3x mowing
7:16  In South Africa that bike would have been gone in the first 5 minutes😂😂
The burrito slap always makes my day one thousand times  better
Hi does anyone know the name of the survey app???
This is my after school routine every day
20 min video this is so poggers
17:43 i couldn't stop laughing
Turdboi420 is a legend
I wish you could just go to greensboro then I might meet you
What happened to Paul Dodd's $150,000 donation? His name isn't in the list at the end of the video anymore
Bro what was wrong with the tires on the mower 😂
sell your bike to get enough money
You cut your hair too much around your Ears, and not enough in front of your Eyes.
love your videos
I need to know what happened to Paul dodds donations
I legit wake up to watch his videos every day
Ryan I hope you comment back. I enjoy this series so much and I love your content
You should have been selling water! At the event! You would have made good money!
U should do some “human tests” for money
Imagine if some freak comes to you with a burrito to interview you 🙂
Bro what happened to paul dodds
Is no one going to talk about how Paul Dodds is gone from the donation leaderboard? What happened?
I love Isaiah Photo! No offense Ryan, but I was subbed to him first. Lol!
After this made a series where you have to visit every country in the world with your crew and you all need to go together.
YOOOO THE LAWN MOWER GOT CAMBAR SICKKK
Wait a sec - in the overview at 19:48, what happened to the 150k Paul Dodds donated? Did it not go through?
Did anybody see those ants!
i love how ryan has almost 9 million subs but no one knows who he is lmao
what happened to paul dodds at the end of the video where his name is supposed to show up?
Dude I hate veggies too but they are good for you 🤣 great video! Excited that the fundraiser is going so well.
Barely early
The survey app gave you 20 dollars because it felt bad for your stomach
Gotta stop taking these dollar and no tip deliveries
Keep up the great work
I feel like Chipotle should reset Ryan
Btw I love Ants their just sooooooo cute and I’m sorry u don’t like them but I like spiders too and I had one on my hand before for about 9 seconds
Yes we've all been there😂😂😂😂
17$ burrito dafuck lmao
😂
Honestly, my question how does he charge his phone?
lets go Brandon!
Inspirational man of the lady few months for me and I really appreciate everything you’ve showed me on this quest of life nothing but respect love and happiness🫡🫶🏽
that was a never ending burrito
15:17 he was so excited the Texan in him came out 🙂 first time I've heard it 😆
Dunno what I’m gonna watch when this ends
Living in NC and knowing Ryan is going to be in my state soon is reminding me of the meme: Ryan Trahan is 7 states from your location. *start running*
Ü
lol isaiah was there too, he is a youtuber
How come no reset with the 100 k donation
Is there a reason why Paul dodds isn’t on the donaters list anymore
hope everyone has an amazing day this video hit! and Isaiah photo donated 5000 earlier and he was in this video
I'm very surprised the lawn mowing idea didn't work! One time I mowed people's lawns and got atleast $20 per lawn, someone even gave me $60!
I swear Ryan started this series with 7 million subscribers and now he’s almost at 9 million
I waited 1 hole day for this video post em faster!!! 👿👿👿
Hello!!!!!!!! Ryan
What’s the survey u use?
I actually fell for that lol 11:09
Iv been here since day 1 baby!   Who else. Keep up the awesome work brother!
No one is talking about how Shopify paid more than a Great Reset's worth just for the title of Epic Memelord. Lmaooo
Anyone else wonder how he charges his phone?
wes anderson vibes transitions music 10 out of 10
where is paul dodds on the top donations
If there's one thing I got, among many other things, people don't properly train their dogs lmao. A properly trained dog is not supposed to walk in front of you, even less pull on the leash. Always walk beside you.
pog
16:57 he littered 😤😡
He definitely made it harder on himself by not having the grass discharge open.

U know the rules and so I have to pe pe😊
It’s weird as we see this he’s currently filming a new video for us
10:53 this doofus really just gave Ryan no tip. If I was him I’d just throw the food at his house
i wana dislike because of the bad jokes but its to wholesome!
Just take a bus it's much cheaper....
:)
Ryan loves Jupiter
I won’t ignore Becca’s $1.00 tip or Andrew’s $0 tip.

It’s crazy how many of the Uber eats orders don’t have tips
this feels so wrong but to wake up to such a positive video just makes me want to get up and do something! Thank you ryan!

well i think jupiter is better more than the yesterday toro
Where did the donation from Paul Dodds go? 😮
On the other side of the screen could you put the chipotle money counter
The amount of feeling, great comedy, and amazing montages. On top of all of that, he’s raising millions of meals for people in need. Best series on YouTube.
Why didn’t you get reset from that doctor guy
Wait what happened to Paul Dodds? Why is he not in  the top donors list?
Hey Ryan, I would really appreciate if we could have a date, or like day of the week . It would just be nice to see what day it really is

RYAN, WE NEED TO KNOW WHATS HAPPENING WITH PAUL DODDS DONATIONS. WE REALLY NEED AN EXPLANATION!!   Paul Dodds twitter just got banned!!! Is he a scammer??
Paul Dodds?

Gg
That lawnmower needs its wheels tightened 🤣
bro 3 people donated 50 000 dollars

Jupiter gang!
Isaiah Potato seems cool 🤷🏻‍♂️
Slow down, Ryan you forgot to subtract your amount that it cost you for your last meal!!!! So your under 100
Boi sus
Andrew ripped you off without a tip

You know you can also buy a gift car for an airline
Plot twist. When he finally gets there only to find out Jimmy is in California making a new video.
0:47 Ryan: good morning can I get ah Me: Am i McDonalds 🤣
At this point Ryan should rename this challenge to “eating Mc Donald’s for 30 days” or “Visiting a McDonald’s from every state!”
U can tell it was more of a green on the greens kinda night 😅😅
Your a smart dude. God bless you
Just here in the comments to see if anyone else noticed Chipotle Andrew didn't tip and if it made them kinda sad
17:10 the taller one was in a different penny series challenge I swear
Ryan is definitely on the top 5 best youtubers 🙌
I saw a vid of someone wanting to cancel you for no reason
What happened to Paul Dodds? Did he end up not donating or something?
I really enjoyed the 20 minute video

uwu 😂
19:44 MAKES ME CRY EVERYTIME I LOVE THIS OUTRO
What happened to Paul dobbs donations?

You should secure your money by buying a product worth all the money you have then return it and get the money back when you need it
What’s the survey app he uses
someone shold donate $49,999 it would be so funny
How much is that dog? 3:20
Jupiter
coming next: traveling the world with a penny
Anyone know what happened to Paul Dot's donation? It isn't on the top donation list at the end of the video. I'm assuming the money never went through or something but I might just be wrong.

Hey Um Ryan next time you walk a dog make sure to buy a water bottle and a littler bowl beacuse that dog was so Thirsty.
Bro you should be biking at night. Go buy you a reflective vest and get some more deliveries after your dinner! Way cooler out too
fun fact: i watched this video whilst helping my cat deliver her babys
imagine someone donated 49,999.99 dollars just that one cent left
Why did u not show paul dodds in the last 2 vids?
Go tigers
There’s something about watching Ryan hustle as the market tumbles that is damn inspirational  Focus, determination, and hustle 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I love how he called the Sandwich a sammy at 1:27
i luv u jupiter
Try doing more surveys
All the random people he interviewed at the end ought to recognize Ryan. He's literally one of the fastest growing channels right now
You could be eating $5 at Wendy’s for a biggie bag, did McDonald’s sponsor you! Go to Wendy’s ! It’s better too
Him : Chipotle is the best part of the my day  Jupiter : YOU BETRAYED ME AND I WILL NEVER FEEL SORRY
look at his subscribers counts 💀 its going 1000milles per second
Did paul dodds refund his donations if so hes such a waste of time
Hi
anyone else notice how paul dodds' name isn't on the top donations board. i think he took his money back
I love jupiter
Not only is this series entertaining and interesting and for an amazing cause but I think we should all aspire to be as positive and wholesome as Ryan. Despite all the hard work he has to put to make money he is still so happy. Thank you for the amazing content Ryan.
yo Ryan got me wanting a large iced vanilla coffee and a burrito
v
I'm so happy that Ryan found out about cinematic mode 😭😭
Ryan having the best series on youtube rn
11:35 I got that one, it hit home man 👌
​ @Ryan Trahan  Ryan didn't pay for his burrito and also why isn't Paul Dodds in the credits?
Nice one
also everytime you have a iced coffee i normally have one with me when im watching and i take a sip at the same time as u lol, its like a daily ritual.
10 Million subbbbbbb!!!! U need it u need itttttt!
The concert was the best place to sell water
The fact that Ryan has now made it that millions of people will slap their burritos before eating them is amazing.
Day 18
Ryan should do this again but trying to get back
The way he says "Lets say, hypothetically, tonight's gonna be a good night. Tonight's gonna be a good good night." This let's you know he's heard the Byakuya audio.
We should have a Jupiter vs Toro which side are you on?
My brother goes to lsu

Go to Taco Bell tomorrow
Him: good morning Me watching this at 8:53pm 😃

Hello.
Nice hair bobby
The ant thing got me
Good night
Good morning everyone
Has anyone else wondered why Paul Dodds name isnt on the list of donators anymore?
I knew once Ryan had the sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle there was no going back
I’ve been watching all of these videos since day one and every video is amazing. Good job ryan.
Just realized he looks like a deaged Casey N.
Ryan you should think about getting a detachable bike/scooter basket that you can travel with and when you get a bike you can put it on
Everyone:    He is a part of my morning routine Me:               When he uploads at 7:00 PM 👀👀
I'd rather sell my information than to have it stolen by google
You’re beat red it looks like you are having a lot of fun.
Why is Paul Dodds not being mentioned in the video anymore ryan?
Shopify got the meme lord trophy
Why didnt he just earn money from the start and buy a ticket directly to mrbeast :skull:
He should find a way to bring the bike with him, some airlines let you bring bikes.
Beans²
For the lawn mowing hustle, call a local realtor. They would love the exposure and if they don’t have a listing not already mowed they might pay for the houses adjacent to their listing to be mowed as a gift to the neighborhood and help curb appeal.
It's my b day tomorrow 🥳🥳🥳
Love your vids have a good day
Your so good at singing
Idk why but I'm liking this series...seems fun.
Why is Paul Donna of the donation list at the end
I slap every burrito I see now
this guy has 2 phones
I love Jupiter
How dose the survey apps profit come from the penny?
those ants were terrifying
Ima be sad when the series ends, i eat breakfast while watching this everyday.
Anyone else see that RX-7 at 4:06 ?
Read my name
Jupiter reminds of the dog I have right now lol...
I wonder what’s going to be the new thing after these 30 days
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen...
Things I have learned from Ryan 1. Chipotle is good 2. McDonalds is good 3. No one deserves to starve
I survived on McDonalds and chipotle for 30 days
I cant beleive how this Series Changed Youtube 😮
the more I watch the more I wanna donate great work bro
He also ate two cups of tuna and rice
I was like he is very brave singing when there is people behind him and he was like I didn’t see those people behind me lol
wait, what happened to the $150,000 dono made by Paul Dodds!! Its not there in the list anymore!
Bro is slowly going crazy
where is Paul Dodds
The best videos are 20+ minutes!
What if mrbeast  got a house and hid in it
4:08 that rx7 tho
Hi
you should be using chipotle app so you can get points and then a free burrito
What happened to that Paul guy who activated the first THE GREAT RESET!!?? 🤔🤔🤔
Wait my name is Andrew
@ Misclick
Good job! I hope you cross America soon! Your a great person

hi subed
i think you should have keep your money and save it until you get a plane ticket to mrbeast at day 1
Ryan keeps things simple even though he has money
Time to make some MOW MONEY with the lawn mower business was gold 🪙
I bet ryan's "fun drink" will become a trend. lol
I cant believe i have watched 18 of these. This series is great.
Hak
Can’t wait for day 19
The toilet’s Ryan has been using must be screaming in pain with all the McDonald’s and coffee flowing through him
how come paul dodds is not the top donor anymore?
Ryan!!! You can ask for complimentary water cups from most restaurants and it’s free 🤍🤍🤍
Pls stop taking $3 order it’s bad for us food delivery workers
Blues on the green happens like 10 times during the summer not once a year
where did paul dodds money go
Just in 2 days i watched 17 videos now its 18 ( i known you from many years but wasn't using social medias for a while

Day 4 of complimenting Ryan's challenge, the music choice and requesting a playlist of it.
This episode is the best one yet!

What if after this series he can do a series where he has to go back with only 1 penny
ngl definitely trying the fun drink
Shopify knows what's up
very good very good thanks guys🤣🤣
ayoo jupiter gang *grunt*
I REALLY want to know what happened to Paul Dodds. Did he donate that money and then refund it just to get clout? If so, shame on him.
Isn’t there a gift card for certain airlines that you can get?
Gey can you go to atlanta
why dont you try going to the airport and flying stsandby?
Do a lemonade stand please 😂😂😂
Imagine if Dr. Phil sees this series and says "oh that's the boy I met" and donates like 50,000 something. Like that would really make Ryan happy ngl👍🏻
This series would make a good fan game.
Why Paul Dodds is not between the top donors anymore?
Where did Isiah Photo come from 💀
buy a cap so u protect ur face from the sun ☀
Youre in day 21 im pretty dure so you have 9 more days left
it’s a little late but next thing to go into your inventory should be sunscreen/sunblock
Yeet
chipotle should give him his own meal
what happened to paul dodds? didnt he donate 150 grand. hes not on the leaderboard if anyone knows the story please tell me
i just realized that trahan kinda sounds like trying. his last name fits so well
You should get a water bottle that keeps water cold
Just imagine he won the lottery
13:00 hi 😏
Hi
Hands down Cinematic mode was dope
I have to say, I dont watch youtubers, kind of dislike influencers, but this series have been really inspirational, show us we can actually succed out of nothing, congratulations Ryan, you are awesome.
It would be amazing , to see a longer version
Fart smellas

What Happen to the 150.000 dono?
How did your stuff not stolen in 18 days sleeping in a rondom places
Is cinematic mode on a phone? Also GO RYAN!
These videos are part of my morning routine now lol
Not to be that guy or anything but since all money must come from the penny why is the survey money allowed ? 😧
Paul dodds donated 150k he’s in the lead. Why are they not showing him?
Can you please wear a hat or bucket hat? It would save you alot of energy
Bruh pov : you can't donate in your country or region
Can I get a sheeeeeesh
Nice
That lawn mower had some mad camber.
Ryan I love your videos. I've been having some rough days. But, everyday watching this series helps make every day easier.
It feels like I'm seeing a new on going anime and I can't wait for new episodes like I need em fast asap. This has been my night routine. I see this series before I go to bed and just wait all day for the next part. Probably one of the best content on YouTube right now 👍🏻
Quick tip. When you are starting the lawn mower you when it starts to start stop pulling on the cord. It could mess up the engine
Yesterday Toro today Jupiter 😇
did you forget your bike?
He should’ve come to Lincoln wood illinois where lawn mowing business is a huge success 😂
quite possible the only thing I've looked forward to during this crypto crash. Thank you
19:49 Nice.
ryan you should make a bank account jncase you get reset
Love ryan growing facial hair
I’m sorry but ur camera guy looks like a bald Ryan remolds. 😎😎😎
Why did he take Paul Dodds of the top donations board?

Ryan I'm begging u please change your Chipotle order if not for me for Hailey

Toro was bette4

Did he say I am Toph??
It's funny that the moment I watched it a moment ago I finished mowing the lawn
Whats the name of the song in the outro??!
its always a good day when ryan uploads
This guy is honestly living a dream come true while also feeding thousands of people.
What survey app is he using?
whos excited for when he gives the penny to mrbeast
ON THE TOP DONATES WERE IS PAUL DODDS??
Im going to be sad when this is over, I love sitting on my deck with a cup of coffee while I watch every morning.

When this ends it's gonne hit hard. :c
6:29 why not come to my house... oh right i live 2 cities away LOL!
Lol Ryan in the future is surviving on 0.01 for 1 year
Who is do you like more Jupiter or toro
The last half of the video is everything.
What part of NC are you going to
Those are some big ants!
I can't believe it's been 19 days already. Can anyone trigger THE GREAT RESET so that we don't have to see this ended?
I hope you get to 10m subs before the season ends
howdy

Those were huge ants!!!
Hi

S H R E K
To be honest, Skittle-chan, We should try to get Ryan to 10M, He has gone through so much, this series is what got me watching him, and it IS pulling a lot of attention in this series so lets get him to 10M!!!! S U B S C R I B E
17:24 Yoo Isaiah wsg
3 Words. Best. YouTube. Series.
i think i have an idea to not lose your money when there is a GREAT RESET  u can make a bank account and put ur money in the bank account i actually dont know if this will work but u can try it
RYANS ACTUALLY A GOOD AF LAWNMOWER
Wow
Can u make it a month pls I love this series 💗
Ryan:screw toy great reset   Paul dodds and mrbeast:you dare challenge me?
You should put the hash brown on the sandwich, game changer
OMG RUNG THE ANTS RUUUUUNNNNN FOR YOUR LIFE
This could honestly be a Netflix series
One day I will try your Chicola order  because we have to same mcdonalds order. And yes I spelled like JK from BTS.
howdy
Please can you update us what has happened with Paul Dodds donation? His twitter has been deleted or deactivated today…
Check out Dscout for some good surveys too
10m subs
hi
He got no tip on the chipotle order and still smiled guy is built differently
As someone who knocks on doors selling solar panels for a living, saving the world one roof at a time, I really enjoyed the hustle.  Don't know exactly what you said on those doors but I would have opted to sell myself and not the lawncare service!  People buy personality and yours is great!  It's why so many people watch your videos!  Keep it up Ryan!
You should get a Target gift card
go ryan
What website or app for walking dogs. I need a money making method to use
What happened to Paul Dodds's donation? Did he ask for a refund? 🤨
Go Longhorns !
Shopify passed the vibe
Get a bike lock
I knew when he got the lawn mower it was gonna be a bad investment
What's the survey app? Name?
I'm from India 🇮🇳 its 9 pm and I'm watching this series since the beginning. I'm in love with Ryan he is generous and introvert 😂♥️
Keep going don't give up
Ok
PLEASE SAY THE NEXT CITY IS Chicago!
fail
Your the best youtuber ever I watch your videos every day
Those ants are huge tho
Shopify donated 69,420
The ant joke got me 😂
My fun drink is 33.3% coke, 33.3% sprite, 33.3% orange fanta, 0.01% air, it is very good and tasty
U missed a money making opp... Shouldve got some waters to sell mannnn
Best part of my day right here!
I love how he’s just mowing their grass in any zigzag direction 😂
nice one i hope you will make more videos like this in the feature
someone will activate The Great reset after you get the 95$
he missed the great reset
The money counter when up by $30 when Ryan was showing us that he made $20 from the survey app. Suspicious.
What’s the name of the walking with a dog app?
It’s basically a commercial of chipotle and McDonald’s 🤣
We luv Toro AND Jupiter<3
Paul Dodds is missing again bruh
Mow money? nah more like Mowey
What did you do with the 80 dollars after it got rest to one penny
“Here you go my friend” dude didn’t even give Ryan a tip and he still was nice to that guy.. could all learn something from ryan.
KEEP IT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE LOVE U RYAN!
longest video yet, nice
What happened to Paul dotts top donner

isaiah photooooo
Shopify is the meme lord lol. Donated $69,420.
Starbucks? nah, Meanwhile... Ryan at McDonalds "Ice coffee plz".
Wait why is Paul dotts gone from the end screen
does anyone know how many subs he has gotten in the past 18 days cause i wonder how much is gonna get raised through this
How have i only just realised u lot still got plastic straws
18:28 Bro isn't scared of a rabib bat biting him when he's sleeping outside. Like I've heard you don't feel their bites...and when you're bit it's pretty much over
you got reset yesterday… cheating.. you should lose everything you make for the rest of the week. Know your own rules.
HOLY CRAP THAT WAS ACTUALLY ISAH PHOTO!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
4:07 is that a rx7 fb 😳
Ryan in in 2030 (crossing the world with one penny)
comment #18
Hi I hope you make it to MrBeast wishes good luck and on day one I liked the strategies you used to get that much money that fast I could never have a brain like yours you are smarter than my whole entire life bro but anyway good luck on the streets with only one penny but you have like billions of dollars after only one penny you even started with a penny it’s pretty impressive cause I’ve never even thought you could do that I thought you were just start begging I was really surprised well I like day 18 it was pretty fun to watch you get a lot of money by walking dogs I could tell and good luck I hope you read this comment there’s like a onepercent chance I’ll read this comment because I’m one hour late so let me watch it
Hello Rian try not to cash out the 95 dollar's so you can use it when you're reseted
I just Realized for all the people like me that watch this as a daily routine when it ends are routine is going to be like what the heck
how he makes almost 100$ a day starting from a penny just gives me motivation that anything is possible, i hope you raise 10 million meals and have a good day.
Howdy 🤠!
WHAT HAPPENED TO PAUL DODDS 19:48
Day4️⃣ of Asking Ryan Trahan for a  reply
Goddamn 666k views in 1 hour
Nearly 9m subs :)
Bro isaigh photo is a youtuber did you know that? He is trying to beat the rock in subscribers
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love when he stabs the straw in to his coffee
Bello
Mrbeast should make this a show or video game
who edits the video's
My favourite part of the video was rayan eating a Burrito and interviewing
I love these episodes ❤   What's the lesson? What is the take-away? Don't mess with Maui when he's on a break-away 💫
Man ! I'm loving it ! ❤️ Beard too 🥰
Ryan you have big man  fingers for a little guy keep up the good work also nice face hair bro!
shame on me for being late to the video...
How do you sleep at  Night Knowing that anything could possible happen.  CURIOUS
Tom gross I????
16:05 i think thats the girl from Dhar mann
19:24 bro me too <:
I genuinely felt sad when the lawn mowing failed :c
THE GROSSI POSSE
merrid?
i think he should buy a reusable water bottle and fill it up at public fountains instead of buying something at every restaurant but ofc it’s fine to get a “fun drink” lol
You’ve done that black eyed pease good good night bit twice 😂
Who dat shopify employee eh?
Hi
Guy: gives Ryan $20. Editor: puts $10 on money counter
Z I’m in the Ryan era  . Can’t stop watch these vids
3:19 🤣🤣🤣😂
The day he said he will mow lawns, i knew it was an bad investment and it was
Ryan never starts his journey on every 30 day series without his iced coffee
Really thought the lawn mowing would have been a great idea, new subscriber here, loving the daily videos! all caught up now
I like Chipotle burritos
Hi Ryan I have been watching from day one
Why did I know once Ryan got the lsu tigers someone would say go tigers and tell him if he played
why is paul dodds not on the end screen list?
God bless everyone and have a nice day and Jesus Christ loves you all and I do too and pray bye.
u should get subway
Shopify coming in with that $69,420
I wnat him not to go to orth carolina as thenif he goes to the other mestry cities the series extends which means more fun and feeding america
I love you Ryan I have been watching since you did running videos you have grown a lot and I think you can do this
Ok ok, I k ow I’m gonna make some people mad and don’t get me wrong, I love Ryan and all but he did say that all money he made had to come from the starting penny. Last I checked he didn’t buy his phone nor the survey app with that money. Just saying
love love you Jupiter 💘
18:16 look like zomebies
Fallout ants.
Your energy and positive mood is inspiring
Jupiter GANG
The Concert was a huge money making opportunity! Great work Ryan, excited to see what you will do!
Shout out to the video editor❤️
I’m honestly surprised at how little people tip for the door dash service! Like the one dude did 0.00 dollars??? Wtf lol
Howdy brother
stop fucking up people lawns
tommorow is my 15 th b day
Mowana is a great movie
Yoooooo 20 min episode! That made my morning.
Where did Paul Dodds go from the chart?
bruh you really had me at the ants part
I'm just waiting for this series to come to an end so that I can BINGE WATCH IT 👀 ☺️
Where did Paul Dodds’ thicc donation go?
18:04 "short"
I watch the series while eating dinner everyday
I hardly think a little clown like you would know how to survive on such little money
you are cheating this challenge so hard, you didn’t flip that penny you are working. Anyone can work 1 week and get a plane ticket, somehow it’s taking u a month, ALSO WHO TAUGHT YOU HOW TO MOW A LAWN. I’d be so pissed if u mowed my lawn in random lines. Your honestly so lucky u got that girl cuz u cringe asf and she only w u cuz of the fame.
Those ants tho 💀💀💀💀💀
Buy a 100 dollar visa gift card
Turd boi 420

Yooo Ryan you are my fav youtuber =D I dont like your videos ... I LOVE THEM !! You are the best ! Good Luck
Bro should walk dogs

14:14 Jupiter gang
Try this app called sweatcoin you get money for walking or riding a bike but also walking and stuff like that
This man has no boundaries for how crazy his videos get!
mow lawn for 24hour
I don’t understand why McDonald’s hasn’t sponsored him yet.
“A yo, daily routine check!” Honestly Ryan, you are my favorite YouTuber ever and I’ve been watching your videos for a good time now. Thank you sooooo much for doing these videos to not only help the world, but your fans and entertain them and overall make their day amazing✨I love waking up and starting my day off with your positive and funny vibes!! THANK YOU AGAIN!! 🥰❤️‍🔥🤩🥳✨💫
JUPITER GANG
Ryan what do you do with the money from THE GREAT RESET?
thanks for making these vids especially since dude perfect’s new video was lackluster
I figured it was only a matter of time before there was a loss. I didn't want it to happen. I remained hopeful. It happens. No big deal. Keep stayin positive. Stay happy. Find inspiration. It'll be challenging to find inspiration after this. "Stay generous"
Love your  series I Watched all of the videos
Man those ants where Big 😂
Dog walking has to be one of the best money making methods yet
💕😗😗💞😗😗ur r so doing hard work......Love ü bro❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️my full sporting watching your video bro...... BRØ careful..............................................

Nice armpit hair.

Normally part of my morning routine was to get a Pop-Tart and start watching him but I ran out of Pop-Tarts so now I'm eating a bagel
random dude: "what kind of dog is that" 🤣🤣🤣
The fact thar we are almost done with this series really makes me Sad 🥺
I’m in choir and I sang the climb for my last concert

Am just asking how does he edit in the day
do the dog walking service
Ryan's videos are a part of my evening routine as im watching these from India. I watch these while dinner. Love this series
you know what ryan should’ve done in the previous state? he should’ve thought ahead. he bought a chipotle card to protect it from the great reset, but if he thought ahead and bought a plane ticket to the next ticket, that would’ve been 2 planes. from one city, he books one to the other, and before he goes to that one, he books to another. big brain.
My father paid me 5$ to mow the lawn twice bigger.  Rest in piece.
Why didnt Ryan thank Isaiah in person for the donation he did. Isaiah must have went home and cried while regretting his life choices :)) I was expecting smth chaotic but no.
i like how you always find different ways of getting money i would just do something that works all the time, idk why you get lemon juice and sprite together, pretty much the same thing, where the camera guys stay when youre delivering food? Jupter so handsome, dont forget water for the dogs, brocolli slays wtf
What if he just buys like an item for however much money he has and then he can just return it whenever to get the money back to be saved from “THE GREAT RESET.”
Let's get Ryan to 15 mil before the series ends
Respect to Shopify donating 69420🫡🫡🫡
Ryan’s awkwardness gets me so mad sometimes for some reason .. but like i still will continue to watch this series to the end even if i feel AWKWARD AND MAD
You got this Ryan! Great cause & great content!
Bro you will not believe but I watched Moana yesterday on my TV literally omg
just buy a razor dude!!!
How does Ryan charge his phone?
YEAA Tom grossi coming in with the W he has fye livestreams definitely check those out if your a football fan
4:56 he run over poo poo🦧🦧💩💩
14:30- wait can we appreciate how good of a singer Ryan is!? Like omg 😅🐶🤍
what ever happened to paul dods
Ryan there is a app where your able to invest when you buy something I forget what it’s called but whatever you buy it give you more money
18:07 man the guy on the right needs some sun
ryan I love you
When he has enough money for buying the ticket he should buy it before checking the donations.
😃
When he looked at the donations at the end he definitely saw the counter go down $150,000 after Paul Dodds took away his donations.
People need to stop jumping to thinking the worse about people, just because Paul Dodds is off the leader board doesn't mean he took his money back and if he did it doesn't mean it was to chase vlout, seriously people need to stop trying to shit on others without thinking of all the possibilities
You should eat chipotle and McDonald’s
this is literally in my daily routine now. watching this in the car on the way to the airport!!
Best series to ever exist ☺️☄️☄️💝
You should use hopper
Ryan deserves 20mil at this point
Go see Preston
Didn't he get reset yesterday? Why didn't he reset the moeny tho?
Ryan: So what are you thinking about Girls: well we just chugged our drinks
Ryan get a lot of subs lets get him to 10 million
If i was you , i was gonna deliver food all day long and see how much you'll got . Everyone like it up so that Ryan can see this .
Wait that song you sang I did it in my graduation
You should get a burrito and McDonald’s
Ryan made orange lean🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
Wait what happened to Paul Dodds donation?
Shopify legends
always waiting for these videos every 10pm cause im from Philippines
Yoo hes close to 90 mil
A
i find Ryan so wholesome, keep it up man! <3
I think today's a treat with almost 20 minutes video.
the challange is just TOO EASY
How does ryan charge his phone
Bro I’m so happy you sang a Moana song. I was in a Moana play and I was Hei Hei’s chicken (fyi in the play Pua and Hei Hei were humans.) And was in the Maui ensemble so I could sing your welcome!
AAAH THE ANTS!!
this series is super addicting i dont want it to come to an end
18:00 funniest part of the video🤣
The shopify donation :)
I highly doubt no one took his bike. I like the series but some of the things aren't accurate
Ryan didnt realize but what he did today is risky because if he got reset all 100 dollars is gone that's like more than half of what you need for a airplane ticket so you'll need 2 more days instead of 1 to get to the next city and time is gold so if you waste time you're wasting money
bruh this gorl be Ireland bruhhhh she be like i will be Switzerland guy zzzzzzbbuuuuhh
ay yo uranus
Make money by selling water or soda because It is so hot there
I think when Ryan gets reset, he should show himself giving it away to a random person.
I suggest you to eat some salad :D
W
Never ate a taco
Love you
IM GONNA DO THE GREAY RESET
Paul Dodds is missing from the end screen
Try selling food me and my friend and then we made like $100
11:11 that is a big ant
Day 9 of begging ryan for a ❤️
How long is die video before you edit it
heyo 8:03, Ryan you good?
Buy sunscreen Ryan!!
i can describe you in one word  it is pennies
I was really expecting 🐜😂😂
That f80 m3 tho
Oh no!!! I accodentally pressed dislike instead of like :(
You always make my day😀👍🏻
At the end of the series you should show how much money you made over the entire series
Hi
Gonna be a little sad once the series ends :' Can't believe how fast days goes by and it's already almost day 20. Also all the hard work travelling and to raise many meals. Praises for you Ryan!
Ryan has anyone told you that you are a great singer. 👍
Where does the money go when it's reset?
nvm
Today is my birthday
Very nice video
Ryan missed the perfect money making opportunity to sell cold waters when he was at the concert
Wow, Such an amazing video on my birthday. you made my birthday even better Ryan, Thank you so much!!!
You have 92.14
Ryan why don’t you spend most of your money every night on an item that can be refunded the next day. It’s basically part of your “inventory” and it’s safe from the great reset, just like how you bought and returned the cooler. Buy an item and then return it the next morning to secure your money.
Where do u put the money after "THE GREAT RESET"
ahhh the part of the ants i did not look away rip me
best part of my day right here this is good work and very entertaining
Why doesn’t Paul dods show up anymore on the donation list
Ryan’s ABOUT page: “just a guy”
I bet i will get a bot on my comment.
good luck bro
Why is Paul Dodds not the highest donor anymore??
And y isn't paul dodds showing up as top donator?
20 minutes episode lfggg
ryan hasn’t used the bathroom in 18 days…

I dont sleep till I see this
I can’t go a day without the series
Love this series
If i subscribe and unsubscribe 100 times would it donate u $1 ?
Anyone else actually kinda like Ryans facial hair
This is a great series Ryan! part of my me and my daughters morning routine now. She is 3 and thinks you are so silly. Love that this series helps donate meals. Your awesome 👌
i sung that in school once in school 1:34
Love from India ❤
Hey rayan why don’t you buy a credit card and a bank account so you but your money in it and it doesn’t get reset
why is Pau Dodds not on the list anymore?
Is anyone wondering how he goes to the bathroom?
get a safe
Okay not trying to be rude or anything but honestly I kinda think $20 is a lot of money if you do it again maybe $10 or $15
6.9K comments...noice 😈
Hey Ryan if you stop here in TN get some pals it's amazing
why did Paul Dodds name dissappear on top donations? did I miss something
what happened to Paul Doods donations? Really hopes it wasn’t a fraud
Oh no i wish you knew that concert was happening you coupdve took so much advantage of all those people being there and got money
Imagine if Ryan hits 10 million subs by the end of this too... He's sorta close so y'know...
Oh, Uranus
Ryan you’re about to be in my time zone let’s get here!
love the guy that found ryan walking with the lawnmower
That interview bit is my fav part of the series so far
Hey bro u forgot Paul Dodds the legend on the donations list
Things I really want Ryan to buy with his money:  1. Sunscreen 2. A vegetable  3. A bike lock
Why haven’t his phone died yet?!?!
WHERE IS PAUL DODDS
Awesome
2018 Ryan was hilarious. 2022 Ryan is not funny
I bet you wont get Reset before you buy the ticket
Hey Ryan when u get reset, where does the money go?
Imagine he won the lotto with the tickets then gets reset lmao
Can you please post one with no edits
THE GREAT RESET-Ryan Trahan 2022
The most mind blowing thing to me is how he manages to survive this long on this diet, while also doing all the other things
This was awesome i have been watching your series everyday since the day you started it
I would die from social anxiety if I was him because cringe kinda cringe
Finally! In the first one hour. Provided it is 11pm over in australia
buy a bank account
end the 30 days as you started by selling water
No matter how long it takes and how many Great Resets occur, I want to see Ryan get across America and give MrBeast that penny.  Even if it takes 60+ days.  Complete the challenge! 😀
can anyone remember what survey app he uses?
I watch a lot of people who donated
Wait how come the great reset didn’t get activated?
in that top donations list, where is that guy who donated 150K?
Ryans arms are getting big as hell since the beginning of this challenge  lol     homie is out there making them GAINS lol       For anyone who hasnt ever basically lived outside its way more xtreme than you think,   (some nights are beautiful)   (Some are scary in the city)   but just to see this guy sleep in his hammock al over the USA is nuts lol    keep going bro        :)
It’s really been 18 days 😳
Best series on youtube !
Ryan this is a daily routine for me lol.
Is it just me or does that lawnmower look like it's gonna break any second now, it is waaay to wobbly......
I’m watching this and the first thing that pops up is mrbeast lol
what happened to paul dodd's donations??
Do a 100 days to deliver a pennie to someone over seas next year or sooner
man Mississippi please go to mississippi
Dude I love waking up and watching your videos honestly could cure any type of depression
I love how he interviews those two girls just to ask what they are thinking lmao
Lol
17:00 just straight up cat
When Ryan got $65.96 I was like Ryan don't get reset now lol
Who would have known this series may also become a 10 million subscriber special too.
Commenting until Rayan replys in 30 day
At 12:08 try saying “bravo 6 going dark”
What happened to Paul dodds
what happened to paul dodds, he aint at 19:47 lol
Jupiter is so cute!!!
Ryan to 10 mil!!!
See the tempest here on my skin
McDonalds sponsor this dude
Anyone else loving these daily uploads
this series should never end
I agree with Tyler Wikoff : SUGGESTING TAKING THE AMTRAK!  Or Hitchhiking, You meet the most interesting people Hitchhiking.  The guy you mowed the lawn for gave you a bottle of smart water, You can refill that bottle for free from any Drinking fountain keep the bottle. I told you about smart water a few days ago.  You did not keep the bottle did you ?  Ok no vegetables but you could get fruit.  No one stole your bike yay! They stole my 'Giant' mountain bike despite the locked gate and it being locked  to a bike rack. That sucked.
I’m in south carlona if I meat you I will treat you good
Hey Ryan! I was wondering for some reason, what happens with the money when you get reset?
2:37 why does the lawn mower have a face is it just me who see that?
buy some multivitamins
we are gonna miss him💔😭
I hate broccoli in the chat 😄
For the people that have been here since episode one, is a legend.
11:11 u actually got me lmaoo
God bless you Ryan hope all your dreams come true and I Subed and donated
Dear Ryan  At the end of the of these 30 can you keep the beard I find it looks good on you
Heh
I ant to like but it's at 69k sooo
Lol turdboi420 is JackSucksAtLife
nice episode
You need sunscreen or a hat!
Dude you are soo funny 🤣 😂
Ryan’s been doing really well!
You said mow money,  I love you man ❤️  Your dad would be so proud of your dad jokes,  loving this series so much!
How does the survey app payment come from the penny?
what happened to paul dodds being the top donator
Amazing job can’t believe how fast he’s been growing while helping with charity.
the romantic shots of chipotle workers making his burrito-
Toro and Jupiter we love you!
you should get a basket for your bike so that you don't have to carry the delivery orders.
If anyone here plays Roblox do you know the game Bloxburg? To earn money on that game you have to do certain jobs. One of them you deliver pizza and when he does the uber eats orders it just reminds me of that idk why.
Gonna miss when this series is over. W Ryan❤️
yo shopify 💀
Today would have been the perfect day for the great reset 😂
Does anyone know what happened to Paul dodds and his 150k??? Why it not on the leaderboard anymore?
Are we all going to ignore the fact Paul Dodds name disappeared from donors list? If you have been following the fundraiser, his funds retracted... Theres a story behind it and someone needs to dig into it.
which one is better Moana or Wall-E? i think you should know.
Where does the money that got reset go?
I feel like getting yer lawn mowed should be 5 or 10 bucks max. The service must just be for super well off peeps not the normies, I kinda think mowing for normies too would get you sooo many more lawns that you might make even more money, but that assumes that its hard to get people for 20 bucks, just wasting time looking for peeps rather than mowing constantly
Yo
I dont get it which survey you use and gives you 20 dolar in one hour. Most of them doesnt. Is it USA only? Also how did you cash it instantly is it camera trick?
i need to know what is the outro song
Who thought you to mow😂😂😂 wtf is that😂😂😂😂😂😂
Stop taking orders with no tip!!!
where have u been going to the bathroom
What happened to Paul Dodds 150k donation? Does anyone know?
Guys RYAN Needs to eat healthy or else he will become fat and get sick so everyone lets make this the top comment and lets make Ryan Healthy MAKE THIS THE TOP COMMENT!
i just want to see the dog walking content
Where did Paul go he donated 150k and now h is
How many of these surviving on 1 penny videos are you going to do?
Ryan's health insurance premium just tripled after the meals survey 🥲
I love you Ryan
love your series man, keep it going, welldone.
Ssissisi
Thanks for the longer videos!! Love the series! Amazing work to you and your editors, supporting a great cause too
Dsisisisisizizozozkz
Dude, Anyone ever shows up to mow my lawn for $20. The answer is yes!
I want to see him walk dogs again
Ssisisidixixizizizizizi
Can anyone pls tell what is average person's income in the US, would be happy if someone who is resident of USA reply thanks 🙂

I wish you the best of luck to get to north Carolina
I thought paul dodds had the highest donation, did he charge it back?
this is the only thing keeping me entertained while waiting for ST4 Vol.2
17:42 That ought to be the best part of the whole video lmao brother.

We just all need a moment of silence to appreciate Jupiter the legend.
Cxdux

Get a bowl at chipotle and 2 tortillas on the side, you get more for your buck.
The Timelapse of you cutting the grass is satisfying
“Ayo… Uranus” - Ryan Trahan
18:33 sana all wlang buhok sa kilikili
We love Jupiter!
Ryan, you are THE best! My 5yo and I watch every day. Keep er movin
16:55 look at ryans face xD but it should be paused
Yo just asking if we subscribe and then unsubscribe and then subscribe again would they still get money? =-l
why not buy food itll be safe from a reset
14:42 man sounded like sonic for a sec
This is my favorite series on YouTube for sure
The ant joke actually made me laugh XD
Imagine if the whole world was like Ryan. It would be a lot better.
You should clean cars
this should become a Netflix reality show.
Noticed Paul Dodds is gone from the leaderbord, did the dude pull back his 150k?
Fuck andrew Mf didn't even tip to get his chipotle delivered.
Im gonna  make a prediction that Ryan is going to finish on day 22. When do you guys think he will finish?
Can't believe it is already day 18!😱
18:21 epic moment XD
Ryan 👋 I eat big ants
Ok
Jupiter gang
You have inspired me, i am going to……   Yes!! Sleep in my hammock tonight :)
Great Video Ryan .
WHERE IS PAUL DODDS??? Why isn't he in the leaderboard anymore? :O
jesus loves you
Love Your Series Ryan . Great Video Ryan .
Bro it is still the morning in Cali
Cat ... 😍😍😍😍😍
You can do it Ryan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So many $2 trips from Uber Eats that’s painful to see
What is the survey app name???
If they ever do a series on what happens if you eat McDonalds for a whole month Ryan would be the best candidate
It’s ironic that u cut the grass in the video the same day I do
Imagine if someone donated 49,999 dollars to the fundraiser 🤣
ryan why dont you buy a bike lock?
You already know Spock is barking at the TV like crazy
Água fresca!!!
Eat burger king
ryan keep this up this series is so heartwarming and i love it so much hope you have a great day
You should include the amount of subscribers gained during this series and how many meals it equals

They say ‘mo money mo problems’  Ryan just said ‘mow, money’  Apologies
Grossi possie packer nasion
My daily routine
Small thing it’s not for dogs to walk with the lead under their arm as it can run them and become uncomfortable
Where is paul's name?
Did I miss something? Why is Paul Dodds no longer on the leaderboard for donations?
This series is now part of a complete breakfast.
where's paul dodds in the end screen?
Bros shoulders must be tired from carrying YouTube
But you got GreatReset-ed how did you have like 26$ at the beginning
Perfect
when this serie ends im going to be upset and a matter a fact this has become my daily routine and ryan you are a legend :0
Not me constantly refreshing YouTube looking for this video 👀
Isiah photo who donated $5000 a week ago is now acting like he don't even know who is ryan  Come on 'TOO EASY' army show some love to ryan
I just want to know how you’re charging your phone😂
Everyone subscribe to Ryan!
i lovs that dud that was like im on ur side poop mrbeast
Lol get 10000$ next🤣🤣😂🤣😂
Ryan you could maybe try to sleep in the house  with a random stranger for one night(not what you're thinking 😂) . Maybe that you could be interesting.
Ryan, you should buy a Visa Prepaid card so that if you get reset you can use that card to buy anything.
AYO JUPITER GANG AYOOOOOOO
Jupiter is cute 🥰
I hope he gets 1million subs by the end of the series
Bruh bro u r getting pumped up 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻

Man that bounce was amazing

The fact that this was posted two hours ago and has 500k views…
Ryan i watched u four years ago when you didn’t have a mil subs but I knew that u would do something good for youtube
Thanks for my Chipotle Ryan!
Damn Shopify with the 69420 donation

1:47 music god
dude I love waking up to watch your vids! keep up the good work 😁
this is part of my morning routine at this point
You gotta live stream this

The amount of $0-2 tips makes me sad. People really out here barely tipping delivery workers
I will miss this series when he completes it this is like my “morning routine”😁
Grossi Posse backs you 100% bro

Ey yo Jupiter gang!
@Ryan Trahan
whats ninja doing there 18:26
I always like to be early… I was an hour late😩😩😩
wait the survey app isn't profit from the penny...
I'm wondering if @Matthias is the owner of spellbound which used to be HI5 studios,with the key series that I have been watching for over a year..
Good morning ryan
every video is that same. watching this kid eat mcdonalds
17:07 i love how the girls are taller than Ryan 😂
i Love tv
imagine Ryan gets to North Carolina and Jimmy flies to like Wisconsin or something
Why Paul Dodds doesn't appear anymore on the donation list? :o
what's the name of the survey app again??? I'm kinda interested to try that tho
HI
we need this series done in Europe!!!
POV: You watch this at night
Sus
Ryan you should really secure another Chipotle gift card
The fact that I been watching this for 18 days straight is kinda crazy
SHOPIFY DONATED 69,000 dollars lmao. But at the same time well done shopify, u've done us proud
This is the best series on YouTube
Ryan deserves a 1000000000000000 subscribers no cap
he is probably already there
Man everytime I see Ryan doing door dash or UberEATS, it just reminds me how cheap people are smh🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ why order delivery if you are not going to tip or just leave $1.
Bro Chipotle Andrew didn't tip 🤡🤡 10:52
we love you jupiter
Day 18 of me trying to convince my boyfriend to watch this series.  Y’all comment why he’s different than regular vloggers so I can convince him to give Ryan a shot!
Is it just me or does he have the same personality has sonic and he sounds simular to him
What is this song at 4:30
where did the paul dodds donation go, it isnt at the end of the video anymore
Bro this is my night routine 🤣  Asia gang where u at
i had a dream about this series 💀
Bruh 11:11

This series makes me so emotional. :(( Bro yall are amazing! Also its crazy how Isaiah Photo made a cameo!! :D
Ryan what if u bought visa gift cards and put ur money in them so u can secure it and not get affected by the GREAT RESET
.
Today my birthday

Make a lemonade stand you’ll get bank
nisam pitao riješi
I reckon he should do the same challenge but for when he comes back home
This guy is a legend
hiii
He forgot about the great reset
Your my favorite YouTuber ryan
I am going to be so sad when this series ends.<3 your vids
Hey Ryan what happened to Paul Dodds? He gave 150k right?
Anybody else realised that Paul 150000$ donation isn't on the top donater board???
so where did the dude who donated 150k go? where his donations not legit or something?
What is the name of that survey app?
Those arent ants Ryan. THOSE ARE DEMO-DOGS!
AYEEE ISSAIH PHOTOS WAS THERE
Man your Chanel is booming
If  I may ask what happen to Paul Dodds in the ending numbers??
idk why i love this series
You should do your next 1 penny challenge in Canada
Ryan kinda looks like me
You have to get out of there man those ants are crazy
You should put your money in a savings account so when you get reset you can get it from the bank
Get a haircut 💇‍♂️ bro.
I love how shopify donated $69,420
My favorite part of this whole series is when he nods when he drinks his coffee
13:08 look at all those chickens!
Let’s say, hypothetically, that tonight’s gunna be a good night
go to cincinnati
Can I get a happy birthday cous its my birthday 🥺
pls ball out and buy some healthy food pls
GRASS.
Ryan you should buy a hydro flask so you can keep your drinks in it like water
Nothing is more entertaining than watching Ryan interviewing strangers while eating a burrito
Ryan : good morning sunshine  Me (Sunshine) : What da
How many of you are watching this as your morning routine? I know I am!
i get the same chipotle order as you
"Uranus" it was at this moment that he knew, he f**ked up (because of youtube demonitization)

Wait, what happen to paul donation???
why is paul dodds not at the endscreen since 2 days?
59 min gang
You shood  make a game out off this seiris
5:43 he has $19.13 and the dude gives him $20 meaning his total should have changed to $39.13, but the counter only changes to $29.13. I'm guessing this was an editing mistake.
Ayo....... Uranus
The interviews were so funny😂😂
Ryan if you scream my name as loud as you can on day 19 I will donate  $20 (this is a joke)
bro you didnt do "THE GAME PLAN" thingy
I expected the lawnmowing to work I'm surprised because usually people don't wanna work out in the heat.
Why isnt Paul Dodds on the list anymore
cant believe its been 18 days already
Who loved to see these series everyday.. Go to your laptop/phone and the first thing you do watch this
JUPITER GANG weird pause uRaNuS

Here is another bet for a penny his next city might be Tampa Florida, I could be wrong and no one would even care to read this but this is just fun for me to see how my prediction go, so far I was right 100% 😅😂
Clip the Uranus part
On the day this was filmed (I assume bc of the last episode when he got the lawn mower) it was my bday!
What happends if it takes you more than 30 days? Do you just give up or start from scratch again?
I love it on how ryan will gain  3 mil Subs In Less than a Month

Money Method: You can get people to pay you to stand in line for them.
My Birthday's tomorrow. I've also been watching the whole series.
Wait wheres Paul Dodds?!
when people ask him *"what do you do for living"* i wonder what hes gonna say to them.
Can't you pay for the plane ticket in two parts incase of a great reset?
First Lol jk
Look how tall those girls are compared to him ahahha
“I LOVE YOU TORO!!!”
someone should make a video game from this, like the levels are states you get to and all the moneymaking methods are different challenges in the levels
Ryan to Chipotle - 'yes'
Thinking about The Great Reset tomorrow, Ryan…
My prediction is that Ryan will reach 10 million by July 7th.
I'm wondering where did Paul's donation go?
Ryan is just hitting puberty lol
No one is talking about everyday when he gets his coffee he sips it then nods and/or says yep
love you Jupiter

Yo what happened to Paul Dodds
My dog who passed away in February had these two squirrels that would like all she would always play with them and it was fun to watch and I really miss her I hate cancer
This man is so awkward I love it ❤ but fr Ryan drink lots of water and eat some vegetable for once lol
ryan you are insane i cant really donate yet but trust me the reset is near. hehehe
Wont opening a PayPal account, and putting all your money in it count as something protected from The Great Reset?
Ok when Ryan had cinematic mode on and couldn’t come up with a catch phrase, I thought that when he said let’s walk Jupiter-that was the punch line… it was the dog. (12:10)
Consider a bus so you don’t have to wait days again till you leave
hes like doing a money simulator
I’m not gonna know what to do with my mornings when this is over
How do u get the actual bill if u cash out on ur phone?

What happened to Paul Dodds 150k donation?
Shopify donated the holy number  RESPECT++
Grossi PACKERS lets go I watch him can't believe he watches ryan
Hi
ryan isnt built up of atoms, he's built out of chipotle chicken rice and cheese
When this series started you had like 8 million subs or less and in 18 days you're almost at 9 million, absolutely amazing
11:47 he has $80 and one penny
When I saw him in the morning he was at 8.06M subscribers and now he’s at 8.96M subscribers! You deserve it and keep up the great work!
Another day another daily routine
Is it just me but watching this series makes me remember what he'll always buy in Chipotle xD (like the food)
i love watching these videos the minute i wake up
you need 10m subs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Been waiting for this little slice of positivity all day!!!
Where is Paul dodds
I love these videos! Part of everyone’s daily routine I’m sure, brilliant series. Brilliant cause. Please never let this end Ryan!!
The way the music matches the mood perfectly is insane
does anyone know what the song is called at the very beginning?
Next time you get a McGriddle and hash brown put the hash brown on the sandwich, it’ll change the game
Ryan how much is a ticket to the next city sell your bike for $60 or $80 and you’ll be able to probably go
It's 40 degree where I live and I live in Europe. What the Hell...
Im just so proud to have found ryan since he was just at 800k subs, always knew he would get this far for the amount of effort he puts in his videos, keep it up man best of luck crossing americaa
R.I.P Paul Dodds the first activator of "The Great Reset"  he donated more than 150k and he wasnt in the "top donators" he wont be forgotten
could have left the bike at the gym
I never drinked Iced coffee.  This series is making me try.
Your next to my grandma’s house
Another Banger! Always look forward to this series!
Come to AZ
caylus donated twice instead of just 10k
“my sweat is sweating” -Ryan Trahan 2022
1:33 yesterday was my graduation an we sung that song
I think u should do Uber deliveries for a whole day
Ryan you should stream your next vid
POV: you wake up and go straight to YouTube to see if he uploaded the next video
This is now part of my daily routine
hows the dog walking app called? i need it
Hey Ryan I've got an idea: why don't you do a Wag walk but also do a delivery at the same time? Just an idea, might not work. By the way, loving the series and loving watching each new video every day Keep going your amazing <3
5:49 Bro gave the camera man money
Hey Ryan an idea or perhaps something you could do is cash out the survey, when you are about to buy a plan ticket or you really need to use that money. the reason for this is because of the great reset could happen on that same day leading you to waste the money you got from the survey
Ryan’s almost at 9 mil! Lets try to get him there
I love how he gets the burrito every time
After the video i don't know what to watch. I love the series
I am actually early this time
Ngl $20 is pretty expensive for mowing a lawn 😂 my mom only pays me $10 to do the whole backyard, side of the house, and the front
Can we just all agree that he never fails to disappoint us with his content ✌✌✌✌
Why isnt paul dodds in the list anyomore?🤔
9 out of 10 complete this is not the alligator ok.
Thanks for the content brother you almost there ... loving this series Ryan
ryan buy a McDonald's gift card
9:23 im still here :)
1:39 is Ryan's attempt at singing. Up to you to decide if it is good.
I pay $100 to mow the lawn
Wait... I thought the cameraman was invisible. 5:46
TOM!!
Go tigers!!! 🐅
Honestly astounded that Ryan has gotten 1.5 million in less than three weeks! That's just so crazy to wrap my head around. Literally no one on this platform is more deserving though. Can't wait to see him hit 10 mil!!! Keep being an amazing human Ryan <3
The way he looks at the camera when the girl said "I think that he's faking giving money to people"
Bro, when you get reset, all the money being taken away should be donated
Can we just all agree that he never fails to disappoint us with his content❤❤❤
try to buy a pre paid debit card to store your money in so that if you get reset, you still have your money
This man gained 1 million subscribers in the less than a month. Respect
Hi
If you see this I hope you have a good day
Anyone else hear a rattle snake at the end of the video
Yo why is Paul Dodds not the top donor?

Hey why is there no Paul dodds name on the top donation list
@11:05 with the no tip
What is the survey app called
ryan deserves 10 mil for doing this series(not a bot btw)
AWESOME VIDEO
4:00 :)
I'm failing to see how the survey app is considered "profit from the penny.... "
I don’t know what I’m gonna do once this series is over, it’s my morning routine at this point! Your amazing Ryan!
Meet up with the Urban Rescue Ranch
another day another video
Let’s go

Can we just all agree that he never fails to disappoint us with his content❤❤❤❤
You knkw what that next video series idea has to be now right around the world in 80 days 👌
I never realized how terrible the Uber eats pays
I don’t like how people now say “Ura-Nus” because of some joke somebody make about the name. I’ve always learned it as “U-Ranus” and it’s so annoying because every time that I say it people are like “OHHHHH” or “AYOOO” (Btw I absolutely schaute the “Ayo” thing as well.
shopify =noice
Doing so well keep it up

less than 1 hour
Can you please shave ryan🥺🥺🥺
Just wanted to comment here to cement myself as a part of this history that Ryan’s creating, BEST SERIES EVER
I have one question, not to burst people's bubbles however I can't not ask. He said all profit must come from the penny, did have to pay for this dog walking service? If not, isn't this against the rules of the challenge? I love the dog walking so much, it's fun, but at the same time I feel it's not adding to his challenge.
Ryan trahan ill donate 500k if it still sctivates THE GREAT RESET
AN HOUR LATE WOAH
helo
Ryan I know you were like wth when u saw those clt airport tickets but my city has like one of the most packed airports in the country and if ur flying American u might see freinds dad as the pilot

GROSSI POSSI PACKEEEEEER NATION…. lol I’m a saints fan so uh, awkward. But he’s a g fr his vids are sick
You need to walk more dogs
isaiah was totally unexpected holly cow
Next time you do this if someone donates 1 million dollars you start back from the very beginning with a single penny and everything in your inventory you also lose  Edit: you are still on that same day and try to get where you need to go. Also blow this up so Ryan can see this. Or another suggestion is if someone donates 1 million dollars they can send you ANYWHERE they want in the world
I love you Jupiter
You should keep your chipotle cup and reuse it
don't read my name.....
Toro vs Jupiter(I have no likes💀)

I know people will get mad, but I think the serveys are cheating, no? Because it doesn't come from the penny.
Tom grossi!
11:08 This is the literal definition of "they got us in the first half, not gonna lie"
Try selling sweets again
Watching you is my morning routine
I would like to call Chipotle and McDonald's to donate in your charity!
The biggest thing I’ve gotten from this series is that we’re really not that far apart from one another. Every city Ryan goes to there’s countless people being insanely generous and trying to help. If we could all be a little more like that, life wouldn’t be so bad for so many.
What happened to the guy that donated $150,189

It is what it is
I’m obsessed with following these videos lol
You honestly should do this once every 2 years. It has been incredible to watch!
I'm super early
This is part of my morning routine 😂
16:21
You earn 12 dollars from a 30 minute walk ? You need to work two full day here for that much money (im talking about workers and jobs with no knowledge needed) and nooo food is not that cheaper here grocery is cheaper and its like at most 20% cheaper  And yes workers here never eat full meals here (I don’t mean they eat fast food or something like that those are luxury here they literally eat bread with anything thats cheap at that time like maybe an egg or a little bit if cheese)
Btw do you guys realize that paul dodds is removed from the donation leaderboard, why is that?
Ontime
pov he has 250 dollers mrbeast oh no no no
💥💥💥”sipps intensely” than “nodds” Yup
16:16
this is the series of summer. series is a great show to watch  and the suspects to get to watch a episode
Imagine he does it for 1 year or 2 months, this series is so addicting to watch and i cant stop watching it. amazing series ryan
why dont u just sell ur bike for 80 dollar and get a plane ticket 🤔
What happened to Paul Dodds?? We need answers!!
Yooo definitely didn't expect Isaiah photo in this video.. cool
U ride ur bike so much why don't u ride ur bike to another city?
Tip to Ryan get a visa gift card to secure his funds
this series is as good as breaking bad
Be scared Ryan
As I am typing this I am drinking a fun drink and it gets extra points because it is fizzy
19:47 where's Paul Dodds?
Wow. Like 12 days left. GG
17-3 times
Didn’t Doctor Mike activate the great reset?
No go gators
Ye

Hi Ryan big fan would make my day if you reply
Part of my morning routine
I wonder how Ryan charges his phone
EARLY HOWDY KING!!
It’s not surviving on a Penny it’s surviving on McDonald’s, also let’s get rayan to 10 mill
Bro another species, dosent have a clue about what I am speaking- Ryan
I ended up watching day 17 3 times
Of course Tom ‘The AFC North is mixed’ Grossi donated, I didn’t see that one coming, but it makes sense creators always supporting each other
12:19 wow, I thought Jupiter was the smallest planet.
Can we appreciate how Ryan has been eating only McDonalds and chipotle for the past 18 days
Shopify is a legend for donating 69,420
JUPITER!!!

Ryan Trahan is my life inspiration
Paul Dodds?
6:35, how did they manage to receive radio signals with the mic don't you need a band pass (resonance) on the electrostatic noise for that or do they mean that there just happened to be some dude listening radio nearby
19:47 what happened to paul dodds
Looks like MrBeast misplayed today, now Ryan is going to secure a plane ticket tomorrow
shopify with that donation number 🤦‍♂️

Imagine not having the penny on day thirty  # keep the facial hair bro
I'm sorry, but can we get a "Good Morning Ryan" Chain-? Like I found that for one, Ryan is now our morning routine, but also two- I found myself literally screaming "Good morning Ryannnnn!!!" Because of how much he makes my day- our days- so can we get a "Good Morning Ryan" Chain???
20 min vlog??? IM SO HAPPY
11:21 vine energy
Jupiter's arm pits are red now.

ummmm... what happened to Paul Dodds on the leaderboard?!?!?!
Jupiter gang
Morning routine for 18 days
Bro when someone donated 20 dollars u had 29. 29+20 is 49 not 59
You should come to Cincinnati, Ohio. I recommend Cincinnati  because it is a major city there and does have lots of options for money making methods. If you do ever come I hope I'll be able to visit you because I live nearby! Let's get Ryan to see this! Consider it!!
You should go to NewHampshire
Im in Indonesia so every time before sleep i always watch this, thanks bro keep it up
Wheres paul dods on the leader board
Howdy 🤠
Elisa wnats him baaaad😂
Hi Ryan Trahan
14:47 at this point just say "the usual please"

The second I woke up I checked my phone to see if it was posted but it wasn’t 😡! So I went back to sleep and it still wasn’t there!! It finally uploaded at like 9:00, UPLOAD QUICKER.
BOYS LETS GET RYAN TO 10MIL BEFORE HE GETS TO JIMMEH
Me don't know what to comment.
Bro is the $3 some type of show gallon of gas is obviously $5
what happen to paul dodds donation
I'm curious how much cumulative time Ryan could've saved if he didn't film himself going somewhere. We've got to appreciate how far he's going for his content considering the potential amount of time that could be saved.
19:10 LETS GOO TOM totally not a fellow die hard packers fan
WHEN IS THIS GONNA END!?!?
12:07
First time I've seen a cameraman being appreciated, beautiful. 👏
What happened to Paul Dodds' name on the donation board?

Dog gang where we at
I literally mowed my lawn today 😅
The survey company probably sells it to food and produce companies to see what you eat so that they can supply more
Hi
If you get reset, just try to buy ticket to nashville or atlanta and then to nc
your a god
He didn’t get Great Resetted by Doc? Love the videos tho
McDonald's and Chipotles donations when?
Good morning
Shopify with the 69,420 donation 🤣
Shopify is sus right now
This dude looks like the guy off of army of thrives the safe opener
Isaiah your the boss
@rayn same bro Moana is a good movie
Can't you get like a bank account and then put the money in the bank? It could be protected by THE GREAT RESET maybe. IDK if that's cheating but....   You  could do anything that holds money and have it be protected from THE GREAT RESET.
I wonder what rhyan dose with the money that gets reset
What happened to Paul Dodds on the donation board???
Ye he he eh🇺🇸
Hi
Were you not reset by doctor mike last night?
Your videos are so good
bro is not a bug
INLIKE MAKING BAZZA DIE
Soo what happened to Paul Dodds 150k, it's just gone? Why?
Ryan, I have a question, where does the reset-ed money goes exactly?
Shopify donated $69,420 lol
This is so cool
let's go
Best part of the video is definitely Shopify donating 69420$  Nice
I OOVE TRASH
Hi
I’m starting to get triggered why Ryan is getting the fountain lemonade at Chipotle instead of the homemade lemonade there.😂😂🙂
I am so happy to see Isaiah photo When is my favourite YouTubers in another one of my favourite YouTubers video
Am I the only one interested in the health involved? Like You’re eating mainly unhealthy foods but you’re being so active so I’m really interested in it
Isaiah what are u doing here?
47 minutes
If you want to protect yourself even more from the GREAT RESET then i recommend buying an item and then sell it when you need the money
Hey Ryan , I've been watching your journey since the begining . I love your videos. Keep up the good work!!!!!
One day in the series you should do a live stream!!
11:28 / 19:57 i was actualy scared
MY POO IS AS SMALL AS BAZTAS BRAIN
been watching from day
Idea every night before you go to bed plebe all your money on something you can return at so the next morning you can return them and be protected by THE GREAT RESET🤸🏻
Best fundraiser series  I have ever seen
14:17
WHATS UR PROBLEM 1:09
There someone donated 150k why he not in list anymore???
I’m completely hooked to this series. Definitely made Ryan my favorite YouTuber. He’s honestly so inspiring!
Is it me or does anyone else have a craving for McDonalds coffee when Ryan goes each morning
Where's Paul Dodds?
I like Isiah potato, he is more creative than Isiah Photo trying to beat The rock
48 MINUTES AGO
9 million comming soon
You cannot watch this video in full view🤣🤣😎😎

Bro met Isaiah Photo and didnt notice
The second I woke u
What happened to Paul dodds why isn’t he on the donator list anymore
Lets go
why wasnt paul dodds at the end
Day 3 telling Ryan to buy sun block
Random question, What are you doing with the money after the resets? as far as i can tell, most of what you're using is cash. Are you pocketingf the difference or donating it to the charity?
Jupiter has an AirPods on when u said sit
I would just like to point out that this series stemmed from an April Fool's day article that wasn't from the actual US Mint itself. Pennies are not being discontinued yet. That being said, this is still an intriguing series nonetheless.
If you come to the Memphis area contact me and I will give you a place to stay
i love your videos!
I love the coffee music lmao
smort
What a guy. Can wait to see what tomorrow got in store
Ryan your just wasting your gift card money
ryan trying new jobs

shopify is literally what i would donate if i had that much money lol
Nobody: Ben Shapiro: 14:38
His dog be like  He never did this to me
E
Ryan don't mention the name of the app and then accuse it of stealing data. They can file a lawsuit for defamation
The Tom Grossi and Ryan Trahan crossover event was one I didn't expect but am extremely pleased to see! GO TOM!
Am I the only one who doesn’t know what happened to Paul Dodds donation?
Put your money into a debit card
Did anybody else not see the money go down when he bought chipotle 15:02
in the next episode you should try and do a wheelie on the bike it would be fun😎😎😎😎😂😂😂😂
I have no idea which time zone you are in right now but I just had 2 of theese videos come out in 1 day and it’s half past ten at night. I am still yet to watch them both
Am I the only one who saw that Paul Dodds is not the top donor even though he donated 150,000 dollars
Early yessir

Y’all we need to THANK Paul Dodds, bro donated 3 MILLION dollars. Man is a legend.
Hii.. I'm Ryan Trahan ..
Hi ryan
Don’t see him up there?
Suche a luser
You killed that lawn
The earliest I've been
Wow you do a food delivery and you earn enough money of every one of them to eat a complete meal in our country you need to do at least 10 delivery (only with motor cycle) to eat the cheapest meal possible so if you wanna live you need to doo at least 20 a day here to earn for 2 meal (considering they are paying you the best price (long distances) ) if its close you need to do 50 per meal so 100 per day to just eat  Yeah i know we are fucked
I have two questions  1. What happened to Paul dobbs 2. Didn’t you say that all money must come from the penny ,so door dash wouldn’t count
How is Ryan charging his phone?
God loves you and god will be there for for your all trip
9:10
Sit little peasant
I love how Ryan kept it positive when that money making plan didn't work, definetly an inspiration to face difficulties in a more positive way
What happened to the guy who donated 150 grand
I think you should buy the $200 and something ticket $200 and something ticket you're on day 19 tomorrow you're not going to make it
Great Video Ryan .
oh yeah that is a good joke dude but why
I don’t think he’s doing all the great resets
I'm just so surprised how ryan hasnt gotten sick, because most of the nights hes out in the air, which can dry up your throat and make your nose run. So, I have a question for you Ryan, are you mortal?
I do mind
How does he charge his phone
Ryan has the best and most hilarious interactions with other people
He Finna lost pounds
I am Indian but i like your videos very good ideas
SUGGESTION: Buy scratch cards maybe you'll win something :)

Hey, i was just wondering what if someone donates $49,999. Will he still get the GREAT RESET . Like i mean Ryan can still reach the goal while having donations coz i feel sad when he gets reset and have to start over.
Chipotle should put Ryan’s 3 pointer burrito on their official menu
IM EARLY
He delivered my next door neighbors food 😂😂
A bit early
This is part of my daily routine react to Ryan Trahan 1 penny series
I LOVE YOU RYAN! 🥹 YOUR SO COOL
This series is AWESOME !!!!! If I "unsubscribe" then re-subscribe, will that count towards the "penny" ?  Cause Ill do it "ALL DAY LONG, EVERYDAY FOR THE CAUSE" !!!!!!
This is part of my daily routine react to Ryan Trahan 1 penny series
Its just sad when the end credits show us ryan will get reset:(
Ryan missed Dylan’s dono
This is part of my daily routine react to Ryan Trahan 1 penny series
How did he start with $26 if he just got reset?
I subscribed this month! 🥳
Hi
Hi
The uh oh at 4:40 😂
Imagine seeing Ryan at your house and asking can I mow your lawn
Isah photos didnt he donate like idk 100m dollers?
Everyone's talking about Ryan being a part of their morning routine but not me. As an Australian he's clearly part of my night time routine.
Buy a mcdonalds giftcard if thats a thing and use it every morning!
i am going to donate 10000k
It's not a Ryan Trahan video if he doesn't. Slap Dat. BURRITOOOOOOOOO
You forgot to stop the burrito
He should get sponsership from chitopola
I would never be able to survive with one penny, no matter how hard I try… 🥲🥲🥲
I like Ryan with facial hair
Hey Ryan you could buy things and resell them the next day to escape... THE GREAT RESET 🤯😰
Bruh, do you eat this much junk food even out of the YouTube videos?
Love Your Series Ryan . Great Video Ryan .
AYO JUPITER GANG!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dude I watch the series in day 6 and I love it so I watch day one to six and in my time 10pm your vid comes out so I always wait for it to come out
RYAN, IF YOU GET HIT BY THE GREAT RESET, THEN MAKE MONEY TO GET A CAR/BIKE AND THINGS FOR A SIGN, YOU SHOULD HOOK THE SIGN UP TO THE CAR/BIKE AND MAKE PEOPLE BUY DRINKS OR OTHERS (i hope you see this i've been watching this since the first day)
Ryan buy a gift card that you don’t need then if you get reset return it it
next vlog idea  using a penny to go back home
The fact Ryan past Airrack in subs is crazy he past him from doing this series.
Why isn’t Paul Dudd’s name not there at the end??
im thinking about why americans have stupid names? Cat? Ireland?
Day 18 of watching ryan do stuff and do nothing else
Anyone realized that Paul Dodd's name isn't there at number 1 highest donation
I fought lown mowing would work out or at least I hoped it  Its the coolest series ever :)
Bro I want to see Spock’s reaction to Ryan walking other dogs lmao
How do you charge your phone

Daily routine
I think Paul dodds took his donation back. He is no longer the top donor and additionally the meals donated didn’t increase much today. It really sucks that he did that, and I think It’s wrong
What happened to Paul dodds donation??

Best series ever
Ryan, when walking the dogs, try to keep the leash on the outside of them. Not under their belly and behind the leg because it rubs against the dog and they don’t enjoy it as much. Hope this helps you!
Hey ryan, haha, question? Where did Paul Dodds go on the top donators? Just a question not awkward at all haha Chipotle? Brain Freeze?
A few days ago, I found this series and  now its a big part of my afternoon routine!
Where's Paul Dodds?
If you created a local post about lawn mowing you would reach 10k people you knocked on 100 homes and had a 1% success rate still 100 customers paying
Man sometimes I hate the time differences id love to watch this every morning, but I guess about 5-6pm is when I eat and when it comes out for me so it aint that bad
You should get clients the day before
I would finish the buretto instead of having it cold
You’re doing a great job Ryan keep working towards your goals I love this series

SHOPIFY WITH THE 69420?!?
I think if would be really cool to do a series like this but in Europe, where you don't know any languages and are constantly exchanging currencies
I hate to be the guy who says this but this guy isn't built for physical labor. Go back to delivery.
wheres paul doddss

Best content of 2022
A few suggestions  -You can get chipotle meals much cheaper if you buy the bowls and then extra tortillas, you also get a lot more food for your money -Could you invest your money in some sort of asset. For example used nerf guns, and then resell them. This would protect your money from the great reset. Keep doing what your doing!
Man ur skin is getting red u gonna get  Skin cancer
the ants (:
Eveary day you get to drink ice coffe with plastic straw you should be so happy in denmark where i come from its illigal to sell plastic straw

You should put the money into a bank so you can have it saved if you’d get a reset
GROSSI POSSE PACKER NATION
Ok I am broke ass so everyone subscribe to Ryan Trahan and raise money for feeding America!!!!!!!🥳🥳🥳🥳
You have absolutely KILLED this series. My favorite on YouTube and in my opinion, has completely changed the YouTube game
How does your phone and camera work for 18 days
Ok wait I think the survey checks what u ate they check the person who ate like this and they like get ur personal data and sell it on dark web
When I wake up I brush my teeth and shower I go to McDonald’s and get ☕️

Try pressure washing
If I unsubscribe and subscribe does it count as an extra meal? I can't donate in my country :(
The amount of 0 and 1 dollar tips makes me sick
It’s my birthday
Jupiter gang :D
Ryan is like the ultimate money maker idea generator but he doesn't know it yet
POV everyone: I’m gonna be so sad when this ends.   POV me: I won’t know the date anymore
The math is bad everywhere, if 1 sub is 0.01 then 1m subs is 10k, not 100k
what do you prefer McDonald's or Chipotle
oooooooh Hailey (is that how its spelled?) Ryans Cheating on you he called someone cute
LOVING THE SERIES AS USUAL!! Really gonna miss it when it’s over 🥲 It brightens my day
Ryan, a couple of suggestions. How about purchasing airline gift cards and also do doordash til almost the bonus of 30 drop offs to protect the great reset?   Great job!
This is basically my morning routine
the survey is technically not profit from the penny
this is becoming my night routine
WHO is turdboi420, donator 65 on the list. I just don't understand who is the goofy ah dude behind that screen. So weird.
broccoli and asparagus are amazing idk what those guys are talking about

This series is like a drug... ITS ADDICTING
Woke up at 5😃

I love this series day 18
My favorite part was Ryan saying uh oh after the mower stoped, I know that feels
How is isah potato there?
That one TikTok video in the middle of Ryan pushing the lawn mower was very funny lol
5904th
10:52 imagine giving no tip
Now the ultimate triple race!  Ryan reaching 10M Subs vs 1 Million $ being donated vs Him actually delivering the penny
Wheres the sound

"ryan slaps burrito" burrito:😫😫😫

Too easy army
I figured out this would be risky. would probably work better in wealthier neighborhoods
Jupiter gang!!

0 hour gang

This series is amazing, the music and the editing too. Anyone know what the intro and outro songs are?
I said soda
Ten years ago, it was a conspiracy to drink alkaline water in order to balance out body ph. Also, it's known cancers and other illness thrive in acid environment. Literally, a conspiracy, now you see alkaline water everywhere.
This has to be in the top 5 yt series’s of all time
35 minutes and already 333K views

for some reason I'm certain Chipotle will sponsor Ryan by the end of this series
Omg the amount of bots in this comment section is wild
Jupiter gang forever

This is definitely one of the biggest and best things to have ever happened on YouTube lmao.

Jupiter Gang!

At the start of the series his subs were I think 6 or 7m subs now he has almost 9m
early
Nice
Ryan, watching this series has been really amazing. I have been struggling with lots of social anxiety, but seeing you do this has encouraged me to get out and be more assertive. So thank you.
I literally watch this series with my parents every day
“I’ve got a burrito. Oooo oooo. And in a few minutes this is going to be good.
Would be cool to see the total amount steps and distance covered within the challenge
Yo Ryan pro tip  When u drink the water at chipotle, and u get a brain freeze, put ur tongue on top of your mouth roof.  Like so Ryan doesn’t need to get brain freeze
Best series in the universe
Question: why was paul dodds name removed from top donations,
I really thought he was serious 11:12. and thought they're probably weaver ants
Mow lawn
when its twelve pm here and he says good morning 💀
@Ryan Trahan I became a sub on day 3 I have since watched just about everyone of your videos and I love them. Thank you for feeding America and Thank you for entertaining us
I found it so cute that Jupiter had one ear down on ear up
anyone else noticed there is a 1k Donation from "turdboi420" is that Jack?
finally he's back again with epic content
I think he f'd up on the calculations at 8:45 cause 29.13 plus 20.20 is 49.33 not 59.33  Edit: nevermind he acknowledged the error and made corrections.
How many subs did have before he started? 7.96 million?
almost 9m
Hi I tried to be early, i’m just hoping Ryan see this. A city closer to North Carolina is Tennessee. You could go to Memphis, Chattanooga. Or Nashville, plus , from Chattanooga you could probably get a taxi to North Carolina it’s not that far

penny
What happened to Paul Dodds
It would be so funny if some one sent 49,999$
Wow you penny videos are great
I think he might complete the challenge a few days early, but The Great Reset will give him a hard time with that.
''so what are you guys thinking about right now'' has to be one of the best interview questions ever lmao
Legend
Also— what happened to Paul dodds?

where did Paul Dodds went from the donations at the end?
paul dodds isnt on your leader board and he wasnt their yesterday either
You could have done it in 1 day if you had gotten a gun then get on a plane and make them take you to where Jimmy. Just saying it’s never to late for that option.
PLEASE! Buy some sunscreen! Your skin is crying out for help and a few dollars is worth it to avoid skin cancer.
Literally watch this every morning with a large vanilla ice coffee 😂😂 from McDonald’s

Still thinking about what happened to Paul Dodds
YESSIR IM EARLY
Ryan is not only cheating on Haley with that lady but he is also cheating on Spock with Jupiter

BANANA
gud morning
Oops, another reset is coming
you should have asked if they had a place to put your bike such a waste
good thng he didnt lawnmo his berad yet
Noice
but first, coffee.
Ryan is smart
He is playing mind games, saying he had a way to protect against the great reset so no one would activate it on day 18.
What happened to Paul Dodds?
Love the videos and what happened to Paul dodds name
i have an idea that you can eat and save money for only $5 get a $5 little caesars pizza because if u cant eat it all then you have leftovers than eating a $8 burrito from chipotle and save more money because you have more food and save money than 1 $8 burrito if u think its dumb then that's you're opinion idc what you say thats all i got
WOW this is like part of my morning routine might donate (THE GREAT R E S E T)
you only need 1.04 million to reach 10 mil subs
Bro what kinda dog is that 💀
Paul Dodds not in the final donations screen?

Love the awkward interviews
Just over half way and the goal has absolutely been DESTROYED! This proves how generous people can be for the right goal. Great job Ryan =)

At this point this series is predictable like morning routine money making methods  and the best part Chipotle and McDonald's
17:40 YOOOO ISAIAH POTATO
Hey Ryan you can probably make money faster by doing Doordarsh and Uber eats at the same time like so you can get orders faster
Isn't one of the rules that all profits have to come from the penny? So then how do surveys count? Sorry if this is dumb just wondering
You got reset on day 17 tho why did you start with 26 dollars
Every time I hear someone say THE GREAT RESET I get goosebumps
Shopify u got smth to say????? What’s with that specific number????
heddo
Wait what happened to Paul Dodd's donation wasn't he #1 with $150k donation

Buy a plane gift card to be protected from the great reset!
Really Ryan go tigers but not go raiders
Hey uh..... what's that survey app?
What happened to paul he donated alot of money but he isn’t on the leaderboard

Wow this is so good hope you achieve your goal
ryan 2 burrito 🌯 slaps in one day for day 20?
This will go down in YouTube history.
Imagine if you won that lottery and got reset that day
the fact that some of those orders are only paying $3 or less is crazy
Why did Paul Dodds’ donation go away? Anyone else notice that lol
Ryan should invest in a bike lock, seems like something that would be useful for him.
Paul dods took his money back ?
howdy🤠
Again I have a McGriddle
I love waking up in the morning to watch this series
18:22 gameshow host: breathes The audience:  Edit: ⋆ටᆼට⋆ how does this have likes!?!?!?
Ryan is part of my morning routine now
Not sure if it’s just me, but I don’t see Paul Dodds on the end screen donations
16:20 WOAH HEY HEY HEY

LOVE THE SERIES RYAN! KEEN FOR THE NEXT ONE!
goat
Who else doesn't know what they are going to do first thing when they wake up when this series is over? Or is it just me😂
Don’t drink alkaline water it’s an eating disorder thing all they do is electrocute the water to ionize it people think it’s all special because there are springs somewhere in Europe I believe idk I’m from America but the springs have natural minerals that make the water alkaline the water people buy that says it like the brands essentia, smart water, or any of the ones that say alkaline or ionized are stupid and they’re upcharged for something that’s actively unhealthy
Early?
I need a montage of you going to get your camera every time
For the subscribers, the count is wrong. 0.01 per subscriber means 15000 meals
Hello Ryan!   !

Bro made more money telling jokes than lawn mowing lmao
Me living in india watching his videos at night
I love this series
Anyone else super sad knowing after these 30 days are over so are these legit amazing vids :/
Hey Ryan, you should try finding clients to mow lawns, instead of knocking on every door. Also, if you do 10 lawns for 30$ thats an easy 300$.
Heck yeah, grossi posse!
If you use the servey, your not making a profit from the penny so, basicly you are getting free money
In cash
Can’t believe there’s 12 days in till the Challenge ends
Where do your Camera man sleep
Is it just me or he looks very weak
Hi

Shopify donated 69,420 that’s hilarious
Your first doner was dono patoto
Grossi Possi Packerrrrr Nation

S
Ryan is just the perfect person to watch while eating! thank you for putting all the work into theese vids!
Its literally been 20 minutes since you uploaded this and there are 200,024 views already! Definitely  the greatest series on YouTube.
Were does the money go when U have THA GREAT RESET do U donate it or something
Everytime these videos are put up it's just in time for me to eat breakfast so that k you for these they help me and put me in a good mood
I don't know if this is allowed but if it is you should buy something before you check the donations so if you get GREAT REAST you can return what you bought and you won't lose the money ( I am not sure if it works exactly like that)
This comment will get zero replies
I love this series, I really think you will make it!
A casual Isaac cameo??!!😂😂
I don't have a lot but I donated 3 dollars :) how do you find the time to edit all of these videos as well. God bless you
What was that interviews dude lol

Just ask the dog owners if you want to walk their dog daily at a certain hour, they might accept.
Hiii😄😄😄😄
toro you may rest in peace..
I watch your daily video every day
The survey money should not be allowed according to the first rule:all profits must come from the penny The phone is not from the penny sooo  Btw love the series ❤️
15:00
The next time you mow lawn, open the side flap, it will prevent your mower from dying out when you mow thicker patches of grass :D

The extra time it takes to make the clips where he “forgets” the camera probably take so long to make
Nightly routine check
Ryan you should totally make a board game or video game out of this series!
Ryan is investing in something not allowed in the challenge you can invest in anything to make a small profit on the side
Where did Paul dodds donation go?
I love how Ryan always says “Good Morning ____!”
My birthday is to tomorrow
Hi Ryan

Love your videos

Ryan promoting the survey app is a really bad idea. They are all scams.
Paul dodds’ donation is gone
Heyyyy
16:20 🤡
Man loves his Chipotle
Cant wait o binge watch this lol
Ryaaaaan
My guy hasn’t had fruit or vegetables in 18 days lol
"Ayo Ur @nus" that made me laugh so hard🤣
ryan keep going and don't give up
Yay not McDonald’s chipotale
WHY DO I KEEP ENDING UP SEEING THE SAME VIDEO EVERYDAY
Imagine having your food delivered by Ryan Trahan
Damn man unlocked cinematic mode. Pog

How do u charge the camra
Ryan is cool
20 min ago
Where is Paul dodds at the end screen
Tonight is going to be a good night, tonight is going to be a good, good night. JUPITER GANG!
i love waiting to watch Ryan’s videos because while I wait I try to guess what he will say after he says good morning! ryan is so positive!
Brooo
Ryan is part of my evening routine, I lilerally live in Asia
Hiw do u charge the canra
your cool
Time for the daily routine with ryan!  *realizes it’s night and becomes depressed*
HELLO
I was waiting by watching
Bro just woke up to this I got lucky
I love how Ryan motivates people, that everything is possible with or without money thankyou for this inspiring series!
This man is speedrunning the youtube algorithm
You should go to Nashville next, it’s not that bad, but it’s been pretty hot this week.
Let’s all appreciate how positive Ryan stays throughout all of his videos no matter how many times he gets rejected he still keeps going and is delivering orders. He keeps socializing  and no matter how socially awkward it gets it dosent matter to him and he keeps smiling and that’s what I love about him
Damn this guy is popular
Ryan does a really good with a lawn mower right guys
Ryan
Jupiter I love you
Iam `10
this has nothing to do with the video but i just had the best cheeseburger
19 MINUTES AND 169K VIEWS
hi
ryan when will u do the golf thing
When this series ends, I might be dead.😭😭
Bruh your gonna skip my state (sc)
Heck yeah im early today, lets go Ryan!
Chipotle for Andrew...why you no tip?!?!
Love this series, but I’m dead curious how you’re charging your phone/camera etc 🤔 it’s been annoying me since the beginning 😂 otherwise love this 🖤
Day 18 Lezzz Gooooo 🔥
The great reset… shall be apon you..
:))
Let's get ryan to 10 million subscribers before this series comes to an end. Honestly, Ryan deserves this for all his hard work! It's so crazy to think how he has managed to actually raise almost 8 million meals in such a short period of time. Way to go Ryan!
No I don’t want the series to end
Hello😀
Meanwhile fans from asia before we sleep lol
I can't spend the day without watching this series, keep it up Ryan!
I tried your burrito order last night for dinner, and it was so gud
Ryan is now my night routine
He’s going to get reset
Oop- math mistake. 5:43 we get paid $20 but it only goes up $10, but it balances out at the survey 8:47 when we get paid $20 and it goes up $30. LOL sorry. Lots of math, not enough sleep 😴
this has made me have so much more respect for delivery drivers and other jobs that ryan has done
sheesh u ust uploaded it 19min ago and it got instantly 160k views nice man! love ur videos
Sadly You just have said no to chipotle for Andrew, he left no tip 10:52
These videos are so good
8:45 money is wrong, you got $20.20 from survey app and you had $29.13 so with the survey money you would have $49.33 not $59.33 not trying to be rude I just don’t want everything to go wrong if you think you have more money I love the series keep it up!
he will hit 9Mil subs right now
doing great!
The lawn was supposed to be $39 not $29.
The Son of God, Christ Jesus, willingly laid down His life to atone for our sins. He rose from death for our justification. Turn from sin, believe on Him, and call on the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation. Time runs out my friends. Love ya'll
15:56 yo texans are dumb or sm wtf? he dont have a TV Show
I live in Louisiana and I feel happy when he wears that shirt
Bro why does every one say the same thing like "THIS IS PART OF MY RUTINE I LOVE YOU RYAN" its like so annoying haha.
Wait Ryan how do you change you phone if you don’t have a charger 🔌
Hi
Yo Uranus, and tonight’s gonna be a good night
Next series:  Travelling across Russia to deliver a pent to Putin.
I live in Louisiana and I feel happy when he wears that shirt
At this point Ryan could name the series "I grew my beard for 30 Days"
This has been the best series of all of YouTube. Holy moly. Can’t tell you how grateful I am for this content.
I can’t believe people are donating over 50,000 dollars.
Ryan I love you so much, I literally wish you’d come to Ohio 😝

My whole day changes after I see your video in my youtube recommendations
The first thing I do when I wake up is watch the videos

big ants and delivery of love  is more funnier than jokes he uses to earn money.
How does your phone stay alive!?!??!
Ryan use walk for money apps
ISIAH WILL BEAT THE ROCK!
Highlight of the video is the dog chasing after the squirrel. It's beautiful
dude looks like alice from brady bunch
Weeeeeee
You should use a card to keep your money!!!!
hi ryan
ew yranes
I’m kinda worried because he only has 12 days left
No howdy at the start:(
This series shows how you can do anything!🤩🚲
ratio
lets be honest our new favorite part is when he walks the dog and gets his mc donalds also when he slaps that burrito
can you please change the order
"Good morning sunshine" always gets me.
Ryan
Ryan I love your videos
Jupiter gang woooooooooooo
That girl named Sunshine: wtf
where did paul dods go???

Bike named after me W
A penny ,that makes sense
Ryan Gonna hit 9m today! 10m soon too
You got this ryan  Bro I actually ❤ this series it is changing so many lives including mine. Keep it up man we love you!!! 👌👌👌
Easily the best YouTube series of 2022
Day 5 Of Saying, You should store your money inside a lockbox/box, And store it in your inventory incase of a great reset. (Just Saying)
Those ants were HUGE
Good luck! Been here since day one
Love your videos respect
I don't understand how no-one is talking about that $69,420 donation by shopify.
He’s going to hit 10 mil before the end of this serious 💪🏾🥰💕 so excited for him!!!!
mower man better
Below 20 minute gang
17 minutes ago i watched all ur episodes they are so good! im sorry but i cant donate
what happened to paul dods?

Anyone else worried that he doesn’t wear sunscreen? 😎
Wish You good look I might transfer £1😅
Best series on Youtube!
This series is insane. Good job man.

Wenomechainasama
my favourite part of this series is watching all the chipotle workers make his burrito
Ryan is jenouanly really funny
Sub toe
Jupiter gang!
*looks at water* is this alcohol - ryan trahan 2022
Ayo
Ryan says ayo Uranus
8:52 I am watching you user-beta-timed...

I knew the lawn mowing wouldn't have worked out. If this series was made maybe 7-8 years ago, it might have worked. Plus a lot of people now days hire someone to mow their lawn like bi-weekly, so its harder to find that work.
Walmart gift card for an emergency reset to do the water-selling trick. Basically let’s you buy water and a cooler then refund the cooler that puts the money back on the card so you can buy another cooler another day/city
Almost 9 mill congratulations 🎊
This gives me joy, when it’s over i promise, i will cry🥲
Ryan's hilarious
You should put all your money in gift cards before you check the donations. This way it is protected from "the great reset" and then you can refund them and you have all your money back.
his chipotle order is not leaving my mind😂
best series ever omgmgmg
The fact that Ryan has been a part of my daily routine for 18 days straight is awesome! I wish it could last longer than a month, idk which series I could watch that would cure my boredom.
where's turdboi420?
Just woke up from the best hammock nap 😴
hi ryan love what your doing
Great video I love this challenge and I watch it everyday when I’m eating cereal

Had a feeling the lawn mower wasn't a good idea
someday this whole series will be straight up nostalgia, like markiplier fnaf series's
These videos are incredible! The quality, editing, songs, and everything else just makes this the best series I could ask for, Ryan you’re a legend
The amount of people that actually thinks he is living off that penny profit is sad
I survived without brain cells for 30 days
I’m surprised Ryan made it this far but I wouldn’t even make it to day 2 lol
gotta fart
hello
Love from nepal

Omg your bike got stolen

Walk people dogs you’ll get money
RainbowX: I don't think you should be allowed to use your phone for apps, Uber eats or DoorDash because the phone didn't come from the *penny*  the comments on their comment: "Don't read my name.."  "Oh.My.God" "D" "I make entertaining videos like ryan!" "oh" "Support Map Pride! Age is just a number and that's a fact."  *whoosh*
love ur content man keep it up

E

I love you so much thank you for all your help
Me and my dad watching this i  Australia at 12a  when it come out

If someone steals your bike, it's never your fault. Just because you dress or look a certain way, crimes that happen to you are never your fault either. Keep up the great work and stay positive!
Good luck man. Doing an insane job, This is a crazy cool series. I really dont want it to end
In fact this IS my morning routine wake up at 10:00 and watch this series
Hi
i love how ryan tells a stranger LOOK AT THIS CINEMATIC MODE
This series has going well even tho there is alot of the great reset doesn't matter and its still going
Doing that to the dog can actually hurt them
CANT STOP WONT STOP

Ngl bro when you mentioned buying a lawn mower I knew it was a bad Investment 🤷😂
You should keep a chipotle cup to refill
We officially now know Ryan’s Chipotle order
Morning routine
Did he forget that he got recited
Keep going champ
JUPITER GANG
At 5:42 the money count went up by 10 instead of 20
Cinematic mode is so cool
Let's go 🚶‍♂️ Ryan

Hi
this series is amazing
plastic straws lucky
Its funny how renting a lawnmower for a day is more expensive than renting a car.
The singing in McDonald’s was great and made my day🤣🤣
YESSSSS
Today had a different vibe bc I had the same coffee as Ryan lol
Yes love this series
Before i go to bed is a must watch ... tank top for the win why so sexy
hello
After this series is over, try to go around the world, it will take a while :)     just dont go around afghanistan...

Hi
Ryan: what’s alkali  Me being 11: WELL.. WHY DIDNT URMSCHOOL TEACH UNTHIS A PH OF 8-14 😀
Goated series love it watch it every day 🔥❤️
Plane ticket more like  Pain ticket
gg
If Ryan donated all the Burritos and McChickens he’s consumed we wouldn’t need the fundraiser
Love watching these videos! Very nice series and much respect towards you! I like all the different moneymaking opportunities you are showing -  gives motivation. I have a course, that I want to make but don't know on what platform is best to launch, it is fitness related. Any tips?
again whare did paul dodds go??
3917th comment  yay
Shopify really just donated 69,420 dollars lmao
The problem was why were you asking people with already mowed lawns to mow their lawn
Lamao
i wish  this 30 days would never end
ghg
In two days he get 70 000 subscribes wow.
Bro singing at McDonald’s 💀
The ant’s got me laughing out loud. Lol
Early
what do you get on your burrito 🌯
This is my favourite video so far there's so many funny moments
There should be a incentive where Ryan will have to eat veggies for his next meal. Sounds worse than the great reset imo.
I love this series ryan does such a good job on it right guys
IN THIS VIDEO RYAN FORGETS HES MARIED DUNNN DUNN DUNNN
Sheesh Ryan ur so far already and already day 18 first 100,000 views.

When Ryan drinks his McDonald’s ice coffee and says..  “Yup”  I know that it is okay for me to start my day. Thank you Ryan for doing what you do and for an amazing cause.

Mc Donalds and Chipotle at this point should just sponsor Ryan

I think a great idea is to wait in very long lines for people for like 50-100 💵,depending on how long they are.It’s a great money-making method that I tried for myself.I love your content too keep up the awesome work! ❤️ 👍
Make it to Tennessee please

Yo Ryan don't keep paying for water at chipotle just go to McDonald's and on the giant screens just look for the free water you can get a small medium or large and you don't need to put water you can also put a drink me and my friends do that to not spend money on drinks

Ryan please look at this but the fun drinks are called rock shandy. It’s not a Hundred percent but rock shandy is bubbly fizzy or regular orange juice, then sprite, and finally lemonade.

I don’t know if this would be considered cheating but if you wanted to save your money from the great reset you can always buy a visa gift card
Hahaaaaq
This is now my morning routine at 9am everyday
Bro is a tank
Let's just appreciate how Ryan is literally crossing America mostly on foot with only one penny. And is consistently uploading.
ryan its the first time being early to a vid :D cause its 10pm here in philippines
Good morning ryan
These videos have entertained me every day, i’ve been watching since day 1 and i’m gonna really miss this series after day 30, Ryan I hope you have some amazing ideas after this
Im not ready to see for reset again
Its crazy how his goal was 1,000,000 Meals and the fanbase has almost raised 10,000,000. He has such a positive fanbase and honestly he deserves it. Good job Ryan!
Watch before comment not like me
LETS GET HIM 9 mil subs BY THE END OF THIS WEEK
Try to say random names in the start of the video
I literally watched this before mowing the lawn
Ryan should start his own fun drink business I would go there daily.
you made this at 10 01 aclock in arstralia

These vids get posted at 4am Hawaii time
Keep it up! this series are so good, and ur a part of my morning routine now! never give up :)
It's afternoon in my country but still love watching this series
Among the first 80k
this series is just one of the best things everyone can watch
ryan hear me out you should turn on uber eats and doordash orders at the same time
bro can we just appreciate ryan lkke every single time he records him walking or biking he has to put his phone on the ground and bike or walk and after the clip he has to get the phone like-
mans is starting the new generation of youtube
Dang just cause of this series he got 1mil more subscribers
him crossing the entire world in 1 year with 1 penny*
I have faith in you Ryan we all believe you can succeed.
Go go GA GA  Love this series and also I have a idea  Instead of sleeping outside you can get a roommate and u can pay a lower amount of money than hotel's 😁
Nice video
False information alert. When Ryan got 20$ the editor added the money by ten
😂
Ryan’s first fail guess the lawn mowing is a fail  but he will definitely just get back all the time and money he earned  or maybe even doubled who knows he is a master negotiator anyways 🔥
Ryan works so hard in his videos i love your content keep the good work
since he keeps saying "ayo (something) check" i just keep imagining him driving  car going "ayo, brake check!"
Love your series a
This video was posted about ten mins ago and it already has 50k views.

You got reset yesterday

100th one here
dude you are so awsome akward sweet i wish you the best of luck
Its my birthday
You missed the great reset with the 100k from last episode
can we appreciate how ryan is doing barely what no one has done
Let’s appreciate how much time the editors and Ryan puts in this video! He does it daily so drop a like and subscribe!This series will be reminded forever!❤️
L
To protect yourself from another *_Great_* *_Reset_* buy some expensive stuff everytime you have lots of money then when the sum of them combined is enough to buy the plane ticket return all of them!  Also buy them from deferent stores.

Nobody:  This comment section: “CaN wE JusT aPpRecIaTe HoW RyAn iS sO cOOl aNd FuNNy? LiKe IF yOu AgReE! 👍”
Idea to buy: Idk if this would be cheating, but maybe like a ^piggy bank^ and you put money into that? and the money would be kept from the GREAT RESET cuz its in the piggy bank
