Beomgyu and Taehyun just sitting alone
“Purple bcs your hair color is Pink” — Soobin 😭
I think Beomgyu pick purple because he love BTS
2:23 THE HECK THEY DID TO TAEHYUN
Yeonbin bricking here also-------🤡✋🏻
1:19 did absolutely no one but me think that soobin picked purple because pink (yj's hair color) + blue (sb's hair color) = purple?????
Cosmo : Pink or Purple? Soobin : purple Yeonjun : why? Soobin : cause your hair is pink Yeonbin shippers : 👁️👄👁️
Is everything ok with Taehyuns arm?

Karen Taehyun can't hurt you, he isn't real  Karen Taehyun: 2:23
yeonjun being sassy sends me  also huening kai mocking soobin for how he says rollerskates gives me life    also anyone notice how many of the grids did not match what was said?
Alguien se dio de cuenta lo que tenía Tae en la muñeca?

taehyun talking in tiny is so cute <3
Soobin: Purple Yeonjun: Why? Soobin: Because your hair color is pink😎 Yeonjun: 😑
The way they try to edit everything to suit with TXT was hilarious esp Taehyun hair : bleach/highlight. 😂

“who is the best dresser in the group” kai:i think it’s me soobin:wow, u went too far with that *then soobin picks kai anyways*

HueningKai teasing soobin at the end was the best part Roller skates~~
the whole video is hyuka being confident of himself..............
Q : Pink or Purple??  Hyuka : ofc pink..  Beom : *thinks* *oh i wanna respect my sunbaenims and im one of their army so* Purple!!   meanwhile the parents aka yeonbin :  soobin : purple! yeonjun : why? soobin : *hun i wanna have sum revenge* because, your hair color is pink :) yeonjun : *i guess i know who sleeps on the couch tonight :))))*    (btw guys only for fun) <3

Txt : green  Kai : of course green !  Txt : it’s you Kai : of course it’s me !  Txt : pink  Kai : of course pink  Me : I-
i feel like some of the recaps are inaccurate coz I heard taehyun choosing red and yellow meanwhile the recap shows the opposite... anyway I loved this content regardless
kai: we are rival yeonjun: -okay  the way he delivered that was fr a “pFT”
Yeonjun's hair............reminds me of my bias ..... guess who is my bias (he is from BTS) .....
2:23 can we just talk abt tayhuns picture for highlights😂
Lol one thing is for certain - no one at BigHit likes Metallic x'D

The difference between TXT and BTS' drip or drop is like so hard to describe because BTS is professional and crackhead at the same time but TXT is crackhead and professional at the same time but its different i dont know why
Hueningkai peak baby behaviour.
‘I like ball’-Soobin
Yeonjun’s unrequited love turned him into a petty bish 💀💔
Their English has improved a lot! I’m so proud of these babies!

Ok so many things are happening here. Every member is so cute where should I look?
Txt is way too cute
pink or purple "purple " "why" "cuz ur hair pink" did soobin realise that his and yeonjun hair = purple
Don't mind me putting this here so I can listen to Yeonjun's "okay" on repeat- 0:36
"Pink or purple" ? Soobin : Pink Yeonjun : Why ? Soobin : Because your hair colour is purple  Few minutes later  "Yellow  or Blue" Yeonjun : Blue , No ! I mean yellow    *To Soobin*  → Please ask me why ? "Because your hair is blue"

I just love how txt is getting really promoted like: they've put one of their great performances , CYSM also run away 🤩 Thank you
they are savages 😂😂 but so adorable🥺
30 seconds in and they're already bickering 😂😂
Yeonbin being petty to each other as always 😭😂
The way soobin said “roller skate” so cutely 😭😭
Why is no one talking about how cute hyuka was when he mimicked soobin’s ROWLLER SKAaAtTes??
omg omg they are so cute
LOL, NOT AT YEONJUN CHOOSE HIGHLIGHTS MORE THAN BLEACHED
Huening to Soobs: RWoLlWer SskateS 🤪
i love yeonjun‘s accent so muuuuchhhh
the way they pronounced 'plaid' was too cute!!
❤️❤️❤️
Ok
In every interview, they are bickering each other 😂
We need enhypen too
Pink or purple TXT : pink Beomgyu :purple  Me: he is an army confirmed😌
But why does Yeonjun sound like he lived in America all his life
1:37 “Please ask me why” anyways “Because your hair colour is blue” 😌 lmao yeonjun so badly wanted to give it back😭😂😂
nobody: literally nobody: yeonbin: bickering at the start
We all know Soobin chose purple cause mixing his and Yeonjun's hair would make purple.
Soobin: Purple Yeonjun: Why Soobin: Because your hair color is pink. ~~ Yeonjun: Yellow Yeonjun to Soobin: Ask me why Soobin: Uhhh Yeonjun: Because your hair color is blue  Lmao these boys
The tension between Yeunjun and and soobin throughout this video 🤣
fashion king yeonjun stressing out which to pick is so funny 😂😂😂
I choose Taehyun♡♡♡
The MOA in me screaming because they didn't even show the 'pear' CYSM outfits 😂 But it's okay editors you did your best
WHO EDITED THE PHOTO OF HUENINGKAI IN LACE AND SOOBIN IN SILK I CANT-
MOAs, go read Hueningkai's diary and check Yeonjun's selcas Y'all missing out!
🥰🥰🥰🥰
They're adorable! Soobin is such a gentle cute giant haha
huening saying him and yeonjun are rivals and yeonjun just goes "ohkay??" PLSSSHASKFHVK
Everyone: talking abt what they picked Me: fangirling over their english
yeonbin bickering sjshs😭
Hueningkai: Highlights
You forgot beomgyu on purple..
This video only show yeonjunie being confused in 3.46 minutes.

I love this :)
I am armymoa i am so happy that they released both videos on the same day🤗
yaampuun tengah malammm oke apa sih yang nggak buat TXT ;D
Who is the best dresser in the group?  Hyuka: I think it's me   Soobin: hahahahaha wow👀
Soobin: roaallerrrr skatess👁👄👁 Hueningkai: roallerrrr skates🙄
3:21 aww lol
Soobin : “ Purple. “ Yeonjun : “ Why ? “ Soobin : “ Because your hair color is pink. “   Yeonjun: "Yellow, please ask me why!!" Soobin: "huh.." Yeonjun: "Because your hair is blue"   yeonbin really said 'no❤️' i cant with them-
yeonjuns “please ask me why” “because ur hair colour is blue” PLEASE HES SO CUTE
Yeonbin teasing each other is a mode
02:23 the icon was iconic tho...
I can't believe they chose school uniforms as their favorite I feel so betrayed 😂
yeonbin is so funny without even trying
Honestly i think yeonjun just snatched soobin's food or something cause boiiii soobin was pissed at him ......  1) made allies with huening kai and helped him become a rival to yeonjun 2) then went on to roost his hair colour like..... 💅 3) barely chose anything similar to him  in conclusion : i fear for yeonjun's life
"We're rival?" "Yeah" "Ookay" LMAOFJSIFJD 38 SECONDS IN AND I CANT BREATHE
Best drama ever Pink or Purple? Soobin : Purple. Yeonjun : Why? Soobin : Because your hair color is pink. A few minutes later Blue or Yellow?  YJ : Yellow. Please ask me why? Also YJ : Because your hair color is blue. That's call paying back. 😂😂😂
Pink or purple?  Soobin: Purple Yeonjun: Why? Soobin: Because your hair colour is pink  Yellow or blue?  Yeonjun: Blue blue Also Yeonjun: Ah no, yellow *turns to Soobin* please ask me why Yeonjun: because your hair colour is blue  Plz he's so petty 😂❤
00:28 So this is why Kai wanted to win best dressed in that other 'Who's Who' video! This explains so much 😂😂😂
1:26-1:37 Another episode of Yeonjun and Soobin bickering / teasing each other.. :D
Taehyun chose leather yet he's wearing all denim ahahaha
Kai was so exited
I love how yeonbin always tease each other that's the kind of friendship ı'd love to see
soobin and yeonjun:  *choose choker and combat boots* me: yeonbin e-boys confirmed

Soobin: Uuhh. I - -  Yeonjun: Because your hair color is blue.   I can't with these two >u< Remember how Soobin said that he has the same personality with Yeonjun which makes them bicker a lot.
