Udoka was constantly molested and abused by Lebron in his short stint as a player… he was hating for 23 years now and still seeing Lebron continually succeed til today breaking more records. I can’t imagine his agony carrying that pain for 2 decades.😅😅
LeBron didn’t get him ejected goofy ass boy. The ref was literally standing right next to them and heard some vulgar shit obviously. These mfs are weirdo’s.
Ime looked like a cab driver playing basketball 😂
That jabari block on ad looked clean.  I didn't see any contact below.  Ad lost his balance when his top half went backwards while his bottom half kept going forward.
Lequeen 😂
That last highlight is an offensive foul btw.
SofT
LeBum Sucks Period!
Bron is a cry baby
So lebron really is a. Coach playing xD
He shouldn't have approached him like that. It's wrong!
Respect to Lebron 😂😂
Ume exposed Lebron. He practically called Lebron a b*tch yet all Lebron did was say, you better watch your mouth. Pathetic, especially when Ume called him a soft-ass boy. He didnt just expose Lebron as a coward, he rubbed it in for the world to see. Lebron has no pride or shame, not very bright either. You cant let somebody totally disrespect you like that, and do nothing about it. It shows how soft and phony Lebron really is esp when he perpetrated by walking over to Ume as if he was goin to do something about it. He was fakin the funk.  Ume leaned into Lebron because he was complaining and crying about calls when he gets away with non-calls all the time. Im so glad his career is coming to an end because he made the team-stacking NBA unwatchable for many years. The insufferable media, league and refs propped up and kissed the guys ass for all the wrong reasons. He doesnt make the game better and he damn sure doesnt make other players around him better. He always needs more help and hes always bitchin about something other than himself. Anyway, the next time somebody disrespects you like that, put that guy in his place! I woulda respected Lebron if he woulda stood up for himself. Instead, he let the ref stand up for him. Soft and pathetic.
If you look closely Brooks defends Bron the same way as the coach back in the day. I bet he gives him the perfect gameplan
So Ime Udoka was Dillon Brooke’s father at one point who played against LeBron and now wants to coach his son and make him go at LeBron? 😂Goodluck with that. Not Bron, fan, eff Ime. That man is a bum at the end of the day. Dillon is ii. He’s just playing a character and chasing clout as Bron’s new nemesis.
Fred pushing Atari off free throw line best part like foh young bull.
Soft ass little boy but you cheat on nia long with the owner wife and get caught 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 what a clown but congratulations on the new 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Hopefully he talked about the fact he couldn’t keep Nia Long.
The NBA is for pronoun users
bron is soft... always been
Shoutout to Tiago catchn strays
That migh be the greatest basketball breakdown video on the web!!…
Damn. Your arms must be tired after all this reaching...
After what he did in Boston he shouldn’t be calling any names.
LeBron pulled a vet move by instigating the ejection
@1:36 Now that's what I call breakdown
😂so lebron set out to prove to this random a$$ player that he ain't soft?! 😂🤦🏽‍♂️foh
Lebron prove ime right Lebron is a soft ass boy
Interesting
Leopps
As a Laker fan Coach got himself ejected stop giving credit for something someone didn't do
The nba is soft. The referees make the game horrible.
Ime is a fighter
And he should have.  Who is Udoka to talk about anyone.  He shouldn’t have ever been hired by Houston.  They’ll be sorry.  He’s an absolute disgrace.
You really did your homework😂
Historic beef? If this is considered "historic" beef, malice at the palace must be Vietnam to these kids. 🤣 8K all in.
Lebron didn't get Ime ejected.. Ime got Ime ejected
Once you listen to jomboy on this, you’ll understand everything. Check out his video
The fans 😂😂😂
We gonna get a video about how the rockets are prime Celtics 21 at home and 23 pistons on the road? 😂😂😂
Respectful? That scumbag isn't respectful
Damnnn😂to have cooked your coach years prior n thrn Cooking his team he coaches but yea some personal COMPETITIVE energy. Is all
Best part was the crowd reaction because we know some serious shit was said 😂😂
Because he's a whiny little b. Truth hurts, especially to a little b like James.
Lebron better make sure his wife isn't making any girl trips to Houston.
Udoka got himself ejected
lebron vs weak ass player/coash
bron beating players then beating them again as a coaches all while still being  a player is wild
Ime look like a Nasty Guy,  like him as a coach,  Go Houston
the way you broke it down into details made it fucking funnier. I was too focused on their conversation I literally forgot the crowd reacting to what they were saying lol
This was fantastic my guy🔥🔥🔥
stretchhhh
That’s why Houston sucks.
But when they shit with BULLZ they get the horn
No offensive language J😊
No need for research. The only reason why Ime said it to le fluffy to man up is because at yr 21 he's still acting like a B'ch! There'a no connection to their on court battles while Ime was a player. Plain and simple. Ime knew le fluffy is spoon fed by the NBA. He wants the league to know.that their rigged games for le fluffy and Lakers is known around the world.
LeBron did NOT get this man ejected
He got himself ejected, your title is click bait.
He got Himself ejected...... use of the Wrong words
In a parallel universe, they got to squabbling 😭
so LeEgo calls out Udoka for using the word Bitch, then LeBron calls him a Pussy ? I think that shows you how LeBlame operates
Someones gotta find one of those people courtside and find out what lebron said
You usually see these ads at the beginning. Nick was Smoove with it
Overblown.... End of story 😱
Ime has more HEART though
Ime is the little bish
The closest thing Jomboy NBA
Coach Nick do a breakdown of your beef with Lebron for the last decade because you are one of Lebron's biggest haters....🤣
LeBitch has never been in a fight in his life.
If i have to watch another Niki Haley add I'm gonna puke!
They both got technical fouls but it was the coach second one so he’s out
Still like ime calling lebron soft because showed to his guys that they have to man up and play hard..in the court play everyone the same not admiration for legends , let that for the refs and the nba ..
for a boycott save stadium.  bn.
in boston see for msg report.
walk on report, g/sh time out only; double header
y’all be reaching !  really , an old game from like “05” 😆🤦🏻‍♂️my thoughts ….STOP! 😆😂
Coach Nick in the thickest of the weeds.  Thank you.
this was hilarious, A+ content
There’s no way you just made up a story about grown men, both of whom you do not know. 😂
Thanks for breaking that down. It makes sense now.
Dude has no rings 🤐🤐🤐
Everyones hates lebron untils he on your team and getting them a ring 😂
Sports used to Great too watch, now just Continual drama of somekind....
This clown Emay has got some nerve, trying to handle business on the basketball court when he couldn't handle his HOME court😂
CLOWN COACH
Lebron remembers everything, including this I'm sure.
I mean Udoka did cheat on his wife so u know who is the p in this situation?
MAKING UP A NARRATIVE IS A LIE
STOP THE LIES!!!!!  WHY DO YALL EXAGGERATE AND TELL US WHAT EXACTLY DIDNT HAPPEN?
I LIKE HOW THIS IDIOT DOESN'T BELIEVE CAM REDDISH WAS IN THE WRONG.  ALL HE CONCENTRATED ON  WAS THE REACTION....TYPICAL
THEY NEED TO STRIP SOME OF THE REFS POWERS.  NO ONE SHOULD BE THROWN OUT OF A GAME OVER WORDS.
IF YOU A MAN IS GETS MAD WHEN ANOTHER MAN CALLS YOU A BISH THEN THAT MAN THAT CALLED YOU A BISH IS RIGHT.
BECAUSE WAS THE ONE WHO STARTED THE SITUATION, DUFUS.
they goofy
Dillion Brook and Udoka are definitely BFFs now. We can't stand that guy, I smell p*ssy.  LeBron: My career is longer than the both of yours combined.
Ime udoka is a trash player now he is also a trash  coach..
You deserve your subs. Great breakdown
A COACH, would never talk to MATT BARNES like that
Luv Fred
Fix the headline they both got ejected. Smh…..
Let's start with this LeBron did not get him rejected he got himself injected only thing LeBron did was react to what the coach said he was already sitting on one tech so that's his own fault
Ime should have more sense than to call the king a boy. Shameless
Soft queen 👸 james😂
Huh? Bron got Ime ejected??! 🤦🏾‍♂️
Soft sss
I’m nowhere near to being a Lakers fan, but Eason is such a b****. He’s the instigator this whole video
Nice commentary - spot on
Thank you coach nick, been enjoying your content for many years now!
Udoka and Dillon Brooks probably share Uncle Rico type moments, of what could have been and how they would've beaten LeBron
Man, he has PTSD
All these people trying to be part of Lebron's documentary lmao
The Best Villain the league has ever known LB Jizzle
LeBron did not get him ejected.  He got himself ejected
That was disgusting. LBJ behave like a Slave owner, he lose all the respect i had on him. Is highly suggest to don't mess with a Nigerian guy. Le Baby cry need to whatch is back all around the world now.
Coach Nick out here trying to be Jomboy. xD
That woman’s reaction was priceless
To have an NBA coach talking to ANY player like that is outrageous and a terrible precedent. He needs suspended
It look like cam side steped away from dude
Whether by word or deed, E-May Udoka lacks self-control.
This is one of my favourite breakdowns!!  Your commentary of the expressions from the fans had me rolling on the floor in stitches!! Awesome!!
lebron must have said some nasty shit for everyone in the crowed to be shook before laughing
Idc who it is if you as coach who isn't running up & down the court experiencing none of the action & a player hears any for of "b****" directed towards them or the team they're gonna go check on that 😆. It doesnt have to be demonstrative or fighting energy but its gonns be some words. Those B's & those P's dont go over to well & dudes not gonna be disrespected especially by mf'n Ime Udoka. FOH 😂
calling b word is too much for weak character to handle, I  would just said u need a tissue or something, I thought coaches could be more understanding
This was so entertaining bball breakdown 😂😂😂😂
This is the second time you’ve basically stolen a Jomboy type video
The league should retire the number 23 #jordan
Anything that adds to the lore of the 2013 and 2014 NBA finals, I'm all for.
Its crazy how much respect lebron demands. He really is the king
My Question is: Why the refs gotta step in at all? I think they've got enough smarts to not get physical. They're men, exchanging words. Let it be personal, it'll make them play better and harder, which is better for the fans. So long as noone gets unduly hurt, let the blokes bark at each other all they want. As an NBA fan, I get a better product in the end.
Because leflippity flop knows that the refs will thank him for letting them slurp him up after the game.
Ime TOOK his(Lebron) candy from him HAHAHAhahaha
TTALK BREAKDOWN GOOD JOB
Leave the competition in the game, including some trash talk. Otherwise, the game can become slow and rather non-competitive.
Lebron is soft! The man complains literally every play even when there’s nothing to complain about! They make up fouls for him. I’ve never in my life heard and NBA coach flat out disrespect a player like that. That was disrespectful and he was right about it. But of course the Lebrontards don’t see anything wrong with Lebron they just are amused at the very site of him and are blind to every game of his
Ime is an abusive ass who shouldn't be in the league. Good riddance.
Lebron is weak minded. He has had fans ejected.
Get a job
If you read his lips the "stop crying like bitches" line was obvious. The "soft ass boy" not so much
Just go to jomboy
Pinpoint
Lebron been soft since the spurs swept him. Thank the spurs for causing these power teams
He and Russ are sensitive,they always getting someone kicked out for hurting their feelings, you ever see Mike,Bird,Isiah as matter of fact these 2 girls probably had more people kicked out than all the players in the history of the NBA😂
LeBron has to be in a really crazy, unique situation when it comes to coaches and "beef"... got to be one of the first players to have actually played against so many coaches who are now coaching against him. Did that make sense? hahaha. Anyways.. what are there like 7 or 8 coaches who actually played against him?
LJ should be suspended for 3 games 500k fine
It’s crazy how many people got jobs in the league that played against bron that’s why they be hating and saying other people better 😂
Udoka is right
Most coaches and players don't respect LeBron. Why?
lol it is so crazy to see the clips of Lebron playing against Udoka (with the clips being such low quality like they are from the historic era lol). AND then to finally realize this whole thing is happening courtside with Udoka now a coach, but Lebron still the best player on the other team.
He rights LeBron always a bit..!!!! He cries like one!!!!
Bro those old clips of Lebron 😤😤🤣🤣 mf been around since forever i swear
Ime's stat sheet is so cheeks 😂
This shows how long lebron has been in the league
You stupid with your remarks. Who cares coaches should coach and stop calling other teams names. Lakers punked them and will again. 😂😂😂
So lebron got Ime ejected and a player never got into it with a coach 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️right
Not a chance LeBron remembers any of those encounters with Udoka 😂
0:20 Coach, how are you going to say that and not provide photographic proof?
Coach is right Leflop is soft he showed that planty of times in his career and complain constantly when samething doesn't go his way like little bitch !!😂
Lebron made at the truth what else is new ngga made he 2nd all time ngga a btch udoka voice 😂😂😂
I kind of figured it was something like they. They don't call him LeBitch for nothing. He's earned that title as well as being mentally soft as baby poop. That's why he had to front run. These aren't even controversial takes, just facts about his (lack of) character in the floor
I wish he was the lakers coach ..
"You shouldn't use the word 'bitches' so loosely," is a clever thing to say to someone whose been exposed for having "too many" women.  But it's also a bitch-made response to someone telling you that you're complaining to the refs/acting soft like bitch over calls.  Don't make it personal Bron.
The ref looked like he said "You want me to throw him out LeBron, okay your out here Udoka.."
Lebron is soft as a dirty baby diaper
You've got the best commentary and video clip of everything.
I said... "Stop crying like B-tches man" 😂😂😂
Just because you are arguably the goat doesn't mean you can't be a bitch
He got Uma ejected because he can. LeBron is the King
That's such a reach 😂
Dude cheated on and embarrassed Nia Long, so it's forever 🖕 him.
ime not understanding bron gone be a team owner in 5 years and he gone be on his ass if he cant control himself
This video screams "Nothing happened that's really worth talking about, so let's talk about something vaguely related so that this video is actually worth something" to me.
This video is hilarious good job bro.
Coache's lip reading skills are point for this one.
OMG lebron shouting travelling 🤣🤣 He's the worst for it in the league, also loved that dillon brooks was blocking lebron from getting to the ref 🤣
These refs gotta stop being so damn sensitive and let players talk. It’s sports! There are high tempers let them talk man. They want players to be robots
Lebron owns the refs and they don't like it when a coach calls them out for it. The truth hurts.
3:40 Lmao that form.
Eason seems dumb gets baited by reddish and then tries to shoot a technical free throw shooting 50 percent lmao
First video I've watched without the classic BBBD intro music. Lez Go Coach.
F*** privileged Lebron.. Ime called him for what he was... Lebron literally falls to the floor crying like a kid who can't get a toy at Walmart when he wants the refs to change the call for him......... Must be tough being a millionaire who passes/shoots balls around.. The hell with people who ACTUALLY make society function, those people should continue to barely get by.................
For the people in the back... that last clip of LeBron, is a 180. Not a 360.
historic beef??.... this is borderline clickbait
Man I love it! It seems there's way more tensioning the league this year and it's about damn time. Too many buddy buddy, let's swap Jerseys over the past decade.
You did better than espn on this report my guy... good job
Didn't they both get technicals, and Udoku got ejected because it was the second of the game? LeHairline didn't do shit.
Nice on the research bro!
Naw Bron has beef with the B word like most of us men!
ONE NAME : NIA LONG
😂 random tiago sighting
Lebum Lames is a soft ass nigga to be playing in the NBA So much so that they added a flop technical call Him and Harden flopping genius
To be a king, he cries alot like a queen. Will never be the greatest at anything except flopping and crying.
Ime is just upset LBJ came into the league before him and is still playing at an elite level.
I’m waiting for a RDC skit about this
We got a full breakdown off the beef 🥩 😂😂
Just checked Ime Udoka's NBA stats... G 316 PTS 5.2 TRB 2.9 AST 1.  Why is it always the scrubs and fringe bench guys that go after Lebron? It's like an orderly criticizing a Doctor, or the CopyBoy at Twitter talking shit to Elon Musk. So Weird...
Change LeBron's name to Cottonelle, because he is softer than Charmin
Reaching foul.
To me, neither should get a tech. I really really hate just how soft NFL and NBA have become. Unless players get into a physical altercation, leave them be. This is pathetic.
LeBron didn't get Udoka ejected. They both got teed up. It was Udoka's second. He knew he was in that situation and continued to press the situation. He's no fool, he knew what he was doing.
This is non-sense. Their on-court battles were just regular days in the office. But the point saying Ime has always had the impression that Bron is soft may be true and that lead to his reaction to Bron's actions. And Bron just felt it's ok to get on his face coz he sees him as a contemporary - about the same age and he played with him before.
Imagine any coach calling MJ or Kobe a bitch 😂😂. The level of grown man respect isn't there for Lebron.
soft ass baby flop king leflop bron...😂😂😂...efin soft like marsmallow s..t!😂😂😂how can u be a fan of this lebum james!
So thats why Ime Udoka wanted Dillon Brooks.
Respect 💯💯😂😂😂😂also was an NBA players here’s some clips lol
how again was the name of the ref that ejected him?
Rockets my team and I even see this hilarious 😅
We need MORE is this in sports
The fans reaction 💀
Didn't realize this was a lakers fan channel.
Biggest thing I learned today is Tiago splitter is still in the league.
Finally someone with balls to cll him what he really is
The reactions of everyone behind them hearing this exchange are gold 😂
did y'all see that shot at the end?🤯 the big homie 38 doin shit like that😵‍💫
The perfect coach for Dillon Brooks, both jealous wanna be tough guys who’s games could never get them the attention they desired, so the had to try other shenanigans.  They both have the common ground of having the same Nemesis even though they are a generation apart.
Maybe he had some Gloria too.
Fred said “nahh.” 😂😂
When the ref is right there and you use the N-word.  I think that is a good reason.
Theres a leak on exactly what they said
Bro that segue to the sponsor was smoooooth asf 🤣
Udoka sure loves saying b*tches 😂
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins. Repent of what the New testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel get baptized and obey the teachings of Jesus. The gospel and the teachings of Jesus are documented in Matthew Mark Luke and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved God bless you all. If you have faith in Jesus through your faith you will live life with him as your example.
Bro is clearly starting a new segment
Brooo.. you’re reaching
James isss a cry baby and they act like he's Holy than Thy.
and you are a bias one lebron lover mj rules
Lebron slurpers unite!
Lbj a punk.
He got himself ejected. Would you really trust the decision-making ability of a man who willingly cheated on Nia Long?!
LeBron didn't get Udoka ejected.
I like the video but this is a reach, so the problem today is because of when they played against each other years ago? Doubt it.
Lebron is like father time in the NBA
U Dookie was just mad his massage parlor appointment got rescheduled 😂
Historic? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When you have more to loose and your image is your brand they call you soft. It’s smart to stay cool and keep your endorsement.
This feels like a jomboy breakdown lol
This has  turned so quickly into a Lebron kiss up channel. LeBron travels ALL THE F...N TIME!!!! But this aging diva seldom to never gets called. Lakers instigated most of what happened in this game. So when other players complain about fouls calls they get T'd up. But his Royal Cringness can just go around commenting every play. All these young players see this bad example and are imitating this clown. Hope this team crashes and burns in the play offs
Good video. I'm actually surprised Udoka even had a chance to coach again. I don't know much about him, but I'm sure a lot of players don't respect him.    I think his language was inappropriate coming from a coach. They both deserved their techs.
Hahahaha! I love it! The fan reactions were hilarious! People are so soft these days. 🤷‍♂️  Edit: I just saw an alternate angle video. The fans reacting was from Udoka being ejected. Nothing that bad was said. Seeing the other angle and hearing the audio... I don't even know why the refs gave out techs.
Makes sense why he wanted Dillon Brooks
It’s baffling that someone would think a man who is 6’9” 260 in excellent shape is ‘soft’. He’s out playing basketball, not fighting. Shows LeBrons maturity versus udokas tough guy persona
I love how all the head coaches, assistant coaches and whoever coaches have at least one highlight from their playing days when LeBron dominated or absolutely destroyed them 😂😂😂😂. And like JoeRogan said, everyone is lucky that LeBron chose NBA. If that freak of nature had chosen mma, he would be best ever. Fking Ime talking like he is the best thing since sliced bread
Bro is def a lebron fan
LeBron gets the refs to shut the opposition. Mj had his plays do the same. Goat my ass lefraud
Damn this beef has been cooking for a decade. And it’s still FUCKING RAW
1:48 😂
Hilarious and informative at once :)
Ime probably got ptsd everytime he sees Lebron. Maybe he still has nightmares about those matchups with Bron. I wonder how many points did Bron drop with him guarding as he seems very salty.
Lebron asked him why he cheated?  And then the fight started.
NBA Twitter was asking for it and Coach Nick delivers as always. Thank you for your service!
I’m bias as a Rockets fan, but Lebron be crying all game! All three matchups it’s crying when touched. Crying when they touch someone.  I mean all damn game you can see it and the killer part is the lakers stay at the line. Like stfu and hoop.
Love ya Bro😂
LeBron is just a crying baby!...
Well done sir 👏🏼
The lip reading is money hahaha
Ime is a home wrecker zero respect for that kind of people
My new favorite coach
Wish Ime would have come to the mavericks . He stands up for his players and he’s tough and knows basketball . I’m so tired of fucking Jason Kidd and his bullshit excuses and him front running than being a vague gaslighter to the media when they bring up his failure to have the players ready to rock . Everytime someone leaves Dallas since he’s been there , they go somewhere else and play better . I like Houston right now , they’ve got a good mix of young and old and they can beat any team on any night if they play hard , but jalen green has been a huge let down this year , plus I thought Jabari smith jr was gonna be a dominating force this year and I’m just not seeing it . Maybe it’s the system they’re in now w van fleet on the ball a lot
Bron was so cold man. Wow. His tape is amazing
We all know LeBron ain’t gonna do nothing to anyone who calls him a bitch
I'm pretty sure there are death threats already..hahaha..
Why LeBron James Got Ime Udoka Ejected?! CUS LBJ's A LIL TULIP
“Well you may not remember, but Ime was an NBA player” COACH NICK CATCHING A BODY
PTSD from a few years back LOL, that NBA Finals was 10 years ago. Splitter still recovering from that
lol I love it we need this in the playoffs
Excellent detective work😂
LeBron needs to go. He is bringing the game of basketball down. He will never be a goat Never
Stop giving grown men Technical fouls for trash talking 😒
Lefraud has a lot of nerves to call somebody for traveling when he does it ALL THE TIME!!!!!🤦🏾‍♂️
If someone bumps into you purposely and unprovoked, why should you get a tech? Eason only followed him because he disrespected him and didn’t even acknowledge it. He did nothing wrong, silly.
April fools is a long way back or long way out.. this is like some breakdown for april fool's..
Nba is just pathetic now.  So many fights. The ghetto mentality is showing.  Men cant act professional no matter if it’s AllStars or Coaches.  Again Pathetic.
Well Lebron is soft
Udoka should just be glad he’s back to coaching and not out on the streets.
Lebron: My money NIA LONG
He’s the exact reason that my family no longer watches the NBA.
Dude are you a Lakers fan? Because you sound a little biased.
This situation made me think about how many active NBA coaches have actually played against LeBron. It's 8. Adrian Griffin, Jacque Vaughn, Jason Kidd, Darvin Ham, Willie Green, Tyronn Lue, Ime Udoka and Chauncey Billups.
You’re guessing. Fake news
Perfect SeatGeek plug
This is a phenomenal breakdown
Lebron is sensitive asf
Why is lebron so insecurely soft? 😂 dray called him a bitch after getting stomped over and slammed on the ground in the finals for lebron to be more mad then him after the fact 😂 Bron got him suspended....klay called him soft nba sent him that 2016 stimulus package...udoka says stop acting like bitches....lebron trying to tell another grown ass man what to say??? He tells udoka 'don't use that word so loosely' with the demeanor of a child who is hurt by the word....why? Because let's face it lebron is very mentally insecure the same guy after his 4th championship he was wanting his dam respect!!! 4 chips in you want your dam respect?? 😂 soft minded it's obvious these dudes (superstars) are not used to someone if not anyone challenging anything they say whatsoever they are not used to challenge and hearing the word NO so you get this or you get the reverse play the victim role 😂 and why are the rockets and lakers playing each other like 2 times a week 😂 and why is the media quick to say they back on track after the rockets but alot needs to change after a spanking?? 😂 soft
I remember that the warriors i.e. Klay, Steph, Draymond saying the exact same thing about lbj, and he went crying to the higher ups in the nba.. so maybe there's some history/ truth to him being a soft bi*ch...
LeBron “stop using that word so loosely”
IS THIS BASKETBALL CHANELL OR GOSSIP?? wtf u same as espn come talk basketball man wtf
Once again LeBron was playing chess while Ime was playing checkers. Lebron knew Ime had a tech already and baited him.
Salute from NEO!💯
LeBron is a cancer that I can’t wait is gone. Long gone
Lebron probably aint never been in a fist fight in his life, never been in 1 on the court. He known for avoiding confrontation & fades, he old af now so he a bully now huh?? Big ass nicca been sheltered by them ppl his whole life, he not bout to hurt nobody.
Where is the rest of the clip from the fan’s perspective?
Let's be honest, Lebron james is very soft.  In recent years, every whistle of the referee towards him ,he cries almost like Baby Luka.
If Lebron boxed Jake Paul who would win?
Lebron didn’t get him ejected, he got himself ejected for being a coach arguing and cussing at a player right in front of the ref!
Simple “king james” is a kitten. Nba has became a joke
Bron had to say something about ime doing Nia long bad.
Because he has too much feminine energy.
thats what you get for disrespecting the undisputed 9th greatest of all time king james
He exposed Lequeen.
So... LeBron didn't get Udoka ejected. Like not even _close._
I never heard of Udoka as a player. I thought he was an NPC in court😂✌️
Great backstory!👍🏾 Udoka at best is a footnote in NBA history, whereas LeBron…
lol fred said fuck outta here 😂
So dude is walking up on people won’t stop the BS and never got a Tech. but two guy talking got techs.
So dude is walking up on people won’t stop the BS and never got a Tech. but two guy talking got techs.
Seriously, this Refs r out of control 😅😑
How did lebron get him ejected they both got technical fouls and the coach already had 1 so he was ejected 🤷‍♂️
Udoka's right, Lebron is soft, but he's always under the ref protection
Halfway through your video I was gonna look for past matchups but you did it lol I figured this is what had happened but it's funny just how much he went at him as a player
Hockey players throw blows. No need for select  alphabet words
So everything about lebron is historical?
Is Ime the most alpha person in the NBA? I hardly know anything about the guy but thats the vibe I get
He didn’t get him ejected he got himself ejected. You people are ridiculous with these headlines.
1:17 1:31 nice editing to sync your voice and the lips😂
Really, bro you reaching…
This is peak bballbreakdown 😅
😂I guess soft boy Udoka doesn't remember the dunks and blocks LeBron made over him,when he was player. I think he was a little jealous because he was a bad player and couldn't forget LeBron.
Tbh, Udoka has had it. You will get irritated to Lefossil whos been in the league for too long and hasnt been called a travel whenever he drives a the rim. Lefossil have the audacity 🤣
because the league continues to suck lebron off
Lebron IS soft. He's always on the floor making sure everybody knows how hurt he is flop or not. Can't you be honest Nick? No wonder your channel hasn't reached a million subscribers yet after all these years.
Amazing content!!!❤
Wow love this
Bron said bad stuff about udoka when he was suspended with the celtics
Beating him before on his playing days then years later beating up his players when he's the coach like they're kids. Hmmm seems a legit reason to be upset I guess?
hhahaha bruh ptsd killed me
I don’t know what lebron said but the face that kid made was priceless 😂 they probably gonna give em a little fine depending on what he said
Bro hates the rockets and loves the lakers 😂
Udoka's career average as a player: 5 pts on 41%....Lebron's 4th quarter stats in year 21: 8pts on 59%....sit your ass down Ime
Kobe used to cook Ime & Bowen of the Spurs
Did Jordan ever get a Coach ejected? LeBum showing who he is again.
Why are you bringing that for???  LeBron cry way to often… stop kissing his a$$
Amazing Breakdown subscribed !
Poor Tiago Splitter, he did nothing and caught a low blow.
Beef doesn’t get cold it just stays warm and then after that a heat up 😂😂
gonna give you a for effort for you to get those clips lmao
beef was so old and forgotten the vid turned to 240p xD
LeBron finally met his match dont argue with a coach or officials udoka put that defense on him
They didnt even have HD television back then 💀
I think Ime Udoka isn't used to Dillon Brooks behaving accordingly so he decided to f*ck the game up himself.
The ref went Oprah: "You get a tech, you get a tech, every one gets a tech!"
Maybe Lebron said "If you spend your time coaching than sleeping with someone else's wife, you'd win a ring by now"
Lebron softness has ruined the nba.
Splitter catching strays 😂
Lebron yelled travel when he travels all the time
That man on the bench look like the oc from the Colorado buffaloes that lost his job mid season 😂😂😂
well i guess it wasn't about thanksgiving...can't remember last time seeing a player and coach have that type of standoff so it might be from them playing each other
It'd be crazy if they're still beefing 20 years later
1:34 did that kid sitting in the front row have some sort of mask on?
The league has a special treatment for LeBron. If you remember their last game, when Sengun drives to the basket with less than 10 seconds remaining with the score of 102-103 Lakers,... and LeBron slapped the hand of Sengun as he drives to the basket.   No FOUL called, the basket went in. On the final position, Lebron get to the basket and win the game for them. I'm not petty on this, but if only the obvious FOUL was called - there could be a huge chance that the game can go further. And who knows?..  Anyhow, I'm not a fun to either side, but that's way too much for a Coach to be tossed just by exchanging a couple of words with Lebron.. LAKERS, as a team, were always favored by the referees, with most calls going their way, particularly in the playoffs, even then during the time of Shaq and Kobe. So,.. it's just way normal that this things happened. That team, overall, is untouchable.
@1:49 Tiago Splitter is having anime flashback
Another soft tech by soft referees
Nice breakdown.  When I saw this, my gut feeling was there was beef going back to Udoka's playing days.
vegas has lebrons back!
imagine getting cooked by bron your whole career as a player, and as a coach your team gets cooked and your assistant coach was on a poster cuz he got blocked by bron lol
Dillon Brooks wasn't doing his job so Udoka does it for him. 😂
Must be one heck of a BORING @$$ Sunday with no nba games😂
'A few years back'  Was literally over a decade ago 😂🙃
It's true though.
Actually the ref hear the n word and was like wait a minute if I can't say it you guys can't say it! Tech!
Yeah you are too good at these BEEFBREAKDOWNs 😂 😂
Great job but not entirely accurate.
Wow bron was whipping current day gead coaches 😂😂 historical shit
***got both of them ejected. And Ime's issue was Lebron's b*tching to the refs which was quite true.
It's always drama QUEEN somehow involved
😂 NBA is soft af
You know Ime one of those salty older dudes who hated on LeBron when he first got to the league😂😂
Why is LeBron allowed to walk over to a coach and say anything? Let's be real here. LeBron knew what he was doing.
Lebron “cry baby” need to retire! …. An a hole… he thinks he’s got it all. 💩
Udoka fucked one of Bron's women?
Suddenly I like Ime a lot more. He clearly wasn't an A tier player but he went at Lebron pretty damned hard. It didn't always go his way but despite the physical mismatch, he got enough done against Lebron to hold his head up high. Plus, he clearly has no problem saying to Lebron what many others think of Lebron.
Reeeeeeachiiiing.
Why is Ime still coaching in the NBA? His career should have been over after what he did in Boston
Brother... Just admit that LeBron is a protected species (cough, pussy as well) and you are a huge Stan of his.   These things will go a lot easier. And people wonder why LeBron doesn't have respect.
Lol Ime does not look like an NBA player
Yo, this was a splendid breakdown. You just got a sub offa that one! Thanks!
“You might NOT remember, but Ime was also an NBA player…”  Spot On 😂
the last lebron baseline spin with 360 layup, to me it looks like hooking. you can really see he grabs their hamstring briefly at 4:17. I think a lot of player often get away with this.
He toll him to shut your cheating b!!!h a!! up lol.
Great video
That's why I rock with Ime, he's a hard nose coach, and is taking no guf from anyone.
Ime needs to watch it the bronsexual might flame him.
Tiago caught the worst stray of the year in this video. Lord. 💀 Bro was in the 4th row minding his business. 😅
Somebody putting LeBron in his place. Here for it 👏
Bron is goat😊
LeBron loves the Chinese government
No one trash talks the queen  - says all actuve nba refs.
It's f'ed up how this is framed. Ime got myself ejected, NOT LeBron.
Ime got himself ejected because it was a double T and it was ime’s second tech.
So coach doing the best Jomboy impression now?
LeBron called him a p#$$y
stop saying Lebron got Udoka ejected he did that himself.
Coach is also tired of Leabron always crying and complaining like a B*tch
ime crying cause lebron outcoaching him.
Lebron did get him ejected!  And he wasn’t having a conversation!
who says the nba today is tougher than the nba in the past??? just because of trivial things like this the coach was ejected??,,,that's why players today won't be able to survive if they played in the past....if they played in the 80s, they would be mentally affected and maybe even worse...
This would never happen in the 80’s or 90’s. Pathetic
Can we just admit how impressive all of this is. Ime played vs LeBron during his 1st stint in Cleveland. And is now a legitimate HC. Understand people many, player or not will never be a HC in the NBA. And for LeBron, listen do you know how old you gotta be to reap the fruits of beef seeds planted many yrs ago. Every time you look up, someone from LeBron's past is pulling up tryna get some get back. Its the NBA version of Spider-Man No way Home. Somewhere Dr Strange let loose a out of control LeBron spell that is bringing back old enemies. Won't be long until the Big 3 Celtics pull up tryna break him. And as for that referee, congrats you just made the league even softer.
Real bright and real tough...coach can't  beat Lebron on or off the court... dude is an idiot but it's Bron's fault? His team lost, he got run from the court, bet next time he'll keep his mouth shut and coach...if he doesn't get fired 1st.  Yep, Bron is soft and Udoka is an idiot.
Did he just call LeBron the P word ? Seems like messing with someone's  else's P got him fired from Boston. I guess since he's coaching again he thinks he's untouchable. That not what Mia thinks.
I don't understand how people can call LeBrons soft. He probably has had the most amount of fouls against him not called every single season.
I can't get these 4 minutes back......
A bit manufactured your stance here
Lebron took a tech while arguing with Ime, where the f did he get him ejected lmao ?
I mean ... he is not wrong about LBJ acting like a bitch. Not really in this instance, just in general.
What a crap take 💩💩💩💩💩. Is just psychology and Udoka felt for it 🤷‍♂️
My man.. this was a great video. Idk if you collected recently reported info/videos or did your deep diving yourself.. feel like you deep dived. You should say that, in case you did.  And thank you for sounding like a normal person, tone and tenor. These other channels, everything is OH MY GOODDD!, YOU GUYSS!! YOUWONT BELIEVE WHAT ACTUALLYYY JUST HAPPENED!!!. H!, I'M SO AND SO YOUTUBER! AND I CANT STOP YELLING OR SOUNDING LIKE A BARKING DOG ABOUT SOMONE STUCK IN A WELLLL!
The title of this video is so freaking misleading and ridiculous..  Try harder..
Hahaha love you Udoka 🎉
Ime stood on business gotta respect it
LeBron's longevity is so insane that beefs with opposing players aren't on his level - he beefs with opposing coaches.
looks like the NBA is run by liberals now
How did you find all that footage of Lebron vs ime when he played lol
Hello
0:58 yooooo 😂😂😂😂 Fred was like tf out the way.
Aye basketball breakdown I liked the video because you seamlessly presented the info on possible beef as back story to the current ejection with that transition into the sponsor of video.   It was an asymptote to perfection.
Are we at the point yet where LeBron has shared the floor with half of the coaches in the NBA when they were still players? When did Steve Kerr retire?
"Thanksgiving, how much we enjoyThanksgiving." BRUH 😂
This channel keeps devolving into being more clickbaity
This analysis is off. Lebron, “I don’t even know who you are.”
Lebron's answer was fucking hilarious man. not even a fan of this asshole but man that was mad funny.
Coach, don’t forget Heat played Spurs couple times in the NBA Finals, when Bron was in Miami and Ime was one the coaching staff for the Spurs
Are You Kidding ? The Losing Coach is Challenging Lebron to a Fight? That is so Pathetic!  In Los Angeles you can Get Killed for Calling Another Man a Bitch!  Go Lakers!✌ ✌✌
This man needs an award. I remember why I subbed
Ime got traumatized by LeBron and unable to move on. 💀
Lebron should have been ejected as well!
“Stop crying like bitches Mann” lol
It's clear that Ime Udoka'd Savannah.
He got himself ejected. A real man don't call another man out his name. Lebron would never. Much more intelligent.
Coach, reaching much??
Leroid is soft
Ime just mad that Lebron still dominating at 39 yo while no NBA team wanted anything to do with him when he turned 33.
Lemme guess, Ime f’d lbj’s mom too???!!
I’m a rockets fan this breakdown was fire😂 I just dk what spirit possessed my team last night shit was brutal.
Lebron has beef with Ime because Ime had beef with his mom.
Cry baby
how the hell these clowns be proclamining lebron as the goat when nobody even respects him.
LeFlop travels every time he dribbles.
" Aiight,  Ime head out  You won, not me ....."
When Dillon Brooks is acting as peacemaker, you know the world has turned upside down.
Bron played in that physical era and was must watch tv to call him soft just because he don’t fight ? Y’all go listen to KG bout Bron
That ref is so soft
haha I am 1:19 into this...amazing
The epic bball music would have gone well with thia video
It's crazy it's been a decade since the 2013 NBA Finals. It doesn't even feel that long.
Amazing BREAKDOWN Coach
Holy shit I never noticed Splitter was there! 😂
Nick loves suckin on Lebron's male part lol, you can tell he loves it
It was LBJ. Not match...smh
man F*** Seat Geak, I got uTorrent
Yep lebron cry like a bitch for real and people calling him the goat 🐐 smh 🤦‍♂️
A-ha! So in other words U's still salty af on m.a.n.y levels...his and Brookie's 9unk azzes lucky they have jobs and need to stay focus 'cause ball dont lie.
dont forget this coach cheated on mia long and lost his job with the celtics
The truth hurts. Sorry Lebitch if your feelings got hurt.
Yo the lip syncs by you at the perfect time as the players and coaches are fucking HILARIOUS 😂😂😂
Another guy who calls LeBron soft, but got dominated by him when you pull the tapes.
Jomboy Media level content good on ya.
Lebron didn't get any majected his mouth. Did he just checked him on what he said to him?  I'm a man don't ever call me a b****.
I actually watched this video twice because of how good it was 😂 great job.
Very good video
Ref to the rescue and protect lecry at all cost.
"Historic"? 'Muricans and their cultural narcissism...
In the second quarter at 11:02 Eason undercuts Reddish and fouls him at the knee sending him flying out of bounds. Reddish just came back from an injury so that's why Reddish bumped Eason.  https://youtu.be/IhGwlACCFII?t=52
30 times a game, LeStatpad is always crying to the refs about not getting foul calls. Udoka was just telling him to stfu already.
Why's he beefing the goat? Doesn't he have a Houston assistant to hit on or something?
that’s what happens when you refuse to fall off…opposing players become coaches
Well when the guys that cooks u years back is still cooking your team, maybe u should just shut up and let the goat do what he wants.
LeBitch was called a bitch. That was it. And the refs had to protect his feefees.
hey dummy, Udoka got himself ejected-take ownership of YOUR actions
Another Lebron apology video by his dck riders
Lmao stop you know damn well this has nothing to do with what happened 20 years ago and everything to do with Lebron being a little feminine crybaby dramaqueen.  The only people who show LeChoke respect are teenagers and people on his Klutch payroll.
This would have been the perfect opportunity for a collab with Jomboy
Udoka a slimeball...kick rocks 😂😂
Something's... off about Udoka. The behavior that got him dismissed by Boston, this kind of high-school playground talk *to players*. He comes across as a man with no class.
Calling 38 year old a boy is crazy
Go spurs go ime all day
This is COMEDY 😂
it’s the crowd reaction 😂 them boys were having WORDS
The level of research here is commendable. Way to go. Love those clips of Lebron going at Udoka
That spin move insane basket by LeBron... in 2023. Yeah. I think Udoka maaaaaybe should just shut it.
LeBron is the 🐐
LePu$$y, ejecting fans from the seats, ejecting coaches from games, next up ejecting   the refs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What baffles me is why this channel still hasn't reached 1m subs yet
😴😴😴😴😴
love it when u emphasize on the reaction of the people behind Udoka was funny😂
1:52 “a few years back” cmon Coach a really 🤣
Not a good look for ime. Bro looks like an abusive loser.  I have no respect for him. And LeBron is an absolute G
Donald trump for president!
No your over reaching..HE just keeping it real with him..lj unlike every one else
LeBron's court awareness is so high that he also knows where the cameras at to avoid his lips being read 😂😂
Ime called him a Jive turkey
bron is such a crybaby
bron been cooking this bum for years now 😂😂😂😂
Come for Coach Nick, stay to find out he incorporates the ad
Bro pulled out the archived footage 😂
“How much we enjoyed thanksgiving” is fucking hilarious
adverb and then the p word lol
You think Ime has Lebron on his top 5 GOAT
coach thats words r really loser hater words
Clear Lakers stan making this video lol
As far I remember Ime was extremely physical with Lebron and he often talked trash just like Dillon. Lebron has a good memory of their battles, and hes not fond of it at all.
this shit was hilarious bro😭 you just gained a new follower! keep it up bro🔥
Dude got his own self ejected all LBJ said was “ don’t use that bitch word so loosely “ because the coach asked him why he was crying like a bitch
are we not gonna mention that person in front row??
I see LeBron's situation resembling Mayweather's. Mayweather defeated boxers who later became coaches for other fighters he also defeated. Similarly, LeBron is now beating team(s) that are being coached by ex nba player(s) that he has also beat.
No coach should ever tell a player do something about it or what are you gonna do about it, so unprofessional and weird. I genuinely don't even expect that from players considering how nobody ever really "fights" in the NBA and it's just the fake tough guy bullshit where they bump chests and then get "held back" by a teammate. Nobody will ever do anything so why in the world is a coach telling the greatest player the world has ever seen, the face of the NBA for 20+ years to "do something." Especially because yes, Eason and Redding basically chest tap each other and Eason continues to yap and get in Redding's chest after getting a call. Why would LeBron not complain about that? He needs to worry about coaching his team, they can't beat the Lakers.
Brons a Beta
When you're as old as the coaches 😅😅
"He might have used an adverb, followed by the P word" 😂😂😂
I'm pretty sure bron wasn't trying to prove anything to anyone, especially udoka lol
Ime was just telling LeBron he's wasting money if he's not buying tickets using SeatGeek
coz the refs these days are SOFT and PERSONAL
Udoka just like everyone, wants to be known as a part of LeBron legacy.
Soft ass boy, he ain't lying. LeBron complains more than anyone and NEVER sees a T because of it.
One day, one day I will be able to enjoy basketball again when LeBum is GONE!!!!
LeFraud  - MJ and Bill Russell NEVER would have been disrespected like this.
To imply that what happened in a few games 10-15+ years ago had something to do is such a reach.
Lakers For Life! 💜💛💜💛 Houston, you have a problem! 🤣
It wasn’t just a conversation. Y’all gotta know what was said and ime idols was swearing at LeBron and calling him soft
I knew it. As soon as this happened, and heard Udoka say he didn’t like the physicality his team played on Lebron, I had to go back to check how he played against Lebron but couldn’t find much. Bum stats thts about it. This is the video I needed 😂
Notice how Ime kept and never broke eye contact with lebron during the entire exchange
This video is a bunch of nothing...
Lebron didnt get anybody anything. Disliked.
Funny how he said stop complaining yet he's complained before and will continue to complain in the future as a coach.
LBJ bias is clear
Coach Nick stay playing the role of Bron's little throat goblin, sucking down the slime with impunity.
Lmao what a biased and annoying video. Dude really went tmz. This is supposed to be bball breakdown and you’re fanboying over a tech
Best take on the call since it happened.  Great job, thanks Coach Nick!
Perhaps we need a drugtest on Ime, his androgens are off the charts
He played against LeBron AND He was an assistant coach for the spurs when they beat the Heat 4-1 in the 2014 playoffs for a CHAMPIONSHIP RING 🏆... That led to Lebron leaving Miami... They have legit beef ...this isn't coming from nowhere 😎🤘🏽😁
Lebron didn't get ecjected. Coach called lebron a bitch. What you think lebron would do
😂😂😂😂 more of this please
Marites ang pota😂😂😂 haha
They called the tech on reddish because they saw his ass run into the other player first, for no reason
OK, Coach Udoka, you barely got a second chance at Houston after getting run out of Boston for trashy behavior. Your act is below a passing grade. Get your team ready to play and leave the rest of the trashy behavior outside the stadium. Don't blow another career chance, man. After mouthing off, you got thrown out and your team then gets spanked.
The strangest thing the NBA has ever seen? Really? Now you’re just pissing me calling it rain!  At least you know I watched your video right to the end. 😁
Wow insane context 💯✊🏿
taigo aint angry at LBJ they won a revenge championship against lbj and sent him running back Cleveland
At the end of this clip might REALLY be the BEST  LeBum bucket  EVER.😲😳👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾   This move is actually kind of Kobe/Jordan-esque!  The difference is  JORDAN & KOBE  have whole highlight reels FULL  of tip-top tier Amazing moves/ buckets while under pressure. Ho-Hum LeBrick LeBum  where you at ??
1:48 "few years back" coach that was the 2013 NBA Finals dog, thats ten years ago 😭😂😂😂 (Damn I feel old)
Jordan never ejected anyone he shut them uo with play and made them watch!! Lebum is nothing a great player who has a problem with narcissism
Confrontation breakdown
LeBron baited him like a vet. Rondo said it "me and LeBron play against the coach, not the team" Bron is a billionaire and a face of Nike, NBA and multiple companies. He’s not gonna fight a fired rookie coach
I didn't catch the crowd reaction until this video lol great analysis
Splitter catching strays haha
😂😂this is amazing. NBA: we love drama!
Ime who???  People don't know the loser. 😂😂😂😂😂
Poor Thiago Splitter catching a stray for no reason 😭😭😭
Jerry Sloan got Dennis Rodman ejected
I think Lebron knew he could bait Ime into chirping. Calculated by him but also he probably genuinely did not like being called a Bitch 😂
Ime is actually the ‘soft as boi’ in reality, who couldn’t keep his dic inside his pants while at work. Bro tryna insult lebron, who has an immaculate record on and off the court. Instant L for Ime, I guess this conclusively concludes why Ime is not HIMe….
Hmmm🤔
No need to do Udoka like that
The crowd reaction breakdown too haha
Nah, I’m with Ime. Lecry is bitch crying and flopping and too hypocrite about it.
Thought i was watching jomboy breakdown for a sec lol
I think lebron has a crush on Nia Long & he isn’t happy w the way she’s been treated by Udoka
Thank you for saying it ime
lol why did Thiago Splitter catch a stray bullet 😂😂
DUMB BREAKDOWN
1:16 Ime Udoka was correct, it's all LeBron has done his whole career.
Udoka clearly wanted to get thrown out. My sources tell me that the game was getting in the way of his planned sexual rendezvous with a married woman.  Rumor has it, since he was thrown out earlier than expected, he had time to bang an intern on his way to that rendezvous. My sources also tell me that he calls that type of action a "twofer".
Lebron don’t even go at steph like that & Steph is way smaller
All he does is cry like a b....
Ime got himself thrown out
man u make lebron define his age🤣 this clips are vintage. damn my guy is old
A as a spurs fan that shot at tiago splitter was truly out of pocket😂
If you want something more based than wild speculation about what was said may I recommend Jomboy's breakdown.
The way Fred pushed Eason away from the free throw line like foh was hilarious!! Youngin, move. It was like ain't no way you shooting it!
Udoka saying out loud what half the nba fans think (the other half are LeStans)
I don’t think it’s a personal beef. I think LeBron just has a problem with that word being used. There’s a clip from his Miami days where he’s chilling calmly on the bench and then suddenly makes a b-line at Mario Chalmers for saying something along the lines of “stop acting like a b****”
That grown ass man got himself ejected
IMe Udoka already had a tech, LeBron didn't get IMe Udoka ejected, yeah they do have history,😂😂😂
lol coach nick loved taking a trip down memory lane.
Man y’all be making shit up so bad it’s ridiculous
😂😂😂😂 top tier news report
That kid man lol
beef
There were a couple of times Ime as an assistant in San Antonio and Lebron got into it, too.
Isn’t that coach too busy sexually assaulting women to be coaching?
Maybe Ime threatened to take his wife.😂😂
This is the footage of what they said to each other https://youtu.be/kyX3fw5-3tc?si=BYbsDfPT9QzkGiOp
Softness aside, I think Ime needs to realize that he's not a player anymore. This could cost him another game or two
excellent detective work
Great analysis and content.. thanks
Lebron didn’t get him ejected. If Anyone gets 2 techs they get ejected
Coach Nick doing what Jomboy and SB Nation do separately in one video. GOATED 😂
LeBron 360 at almost 40 unheard of
lebron is such a cry baby. always asking for help. players, free throw, ejection and still only won 4 🤣
bruh. Imei was a nobody roleplayer in the NBA back then. his mediocre coaching career is somehow just a bit better, but he fumbled. And Lebron is still one of the top players in the league. Lebron knew he had a tech already and decided to take advantage LOL Udoka got played.
So now, Bball Breakdown is Jomboy, AND Secret Base “Beef History”. If you disagree, you’re what Lebron called Ime
damn the history with these two haha
1:45 you ain’t have to do tiago splitter like that😂
Lebron so old he was playing back when 360p was ground breaking television.
Nice breakdown
Great breakdown
the best breakdown i have ever heard.
Cuz he destroyed Lebum.
Le Flop/ Le Travel himself calling out loud for a travelling?
When you're so old in the game that you argue with coaches from your earlier playing days. Haha. I love it.
lebron be crying on every call like a little bih anyways
This is a great breakdown.
I need this breakdown with the classic BBallbreakdown music 😂.
There was another creator who messed with the video and turned up the sound on LeBron and he was saying "Don't use that word with me." In other words, before LeBron said that Ime told him to quit whining like a "soft ass boy."
Thank you so much for the lip reading I needed so bad to know what they said
Udoka is a genius. He’s starting to deconstructing the myth that Lebron instigues fear into players. It’s this generation players fault to fear him since he’s not an elite scorer. A generation was wasted fearing a layup scorer.
Nice vid.
*Y’all praise bron for being an insecure snitch🤡🐀*
Bikram yoga stretch
Bro including that rockets assistant getting dunked on was disrespectful but hilarious. Great work as always.
Lecry to the teacher
The B word got Bron going
Because LeBron is soft. He cries to the refs on every possession.   Dude wanted no part of that smoke from Ime.
grey hair ref couldn't wait to call a tech, invaded their conversation and had his whistle ready
Nick FFS just let Lebron live his life and stop looking for a reason to slander him any chance you get - hard to fathom what goes on in your brain when you title these videos - what a goof
Players are like elephants, they dont forget
BS... lakers defend like that all the time. Udoka is right. Lakers are soft and crying for fouls all the time. Stats support that claim. Ever since they complained with that letter, they lead the league in free throw differential. They did not before though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mSiQTtMbIU
HISTORIC BEEF
Lip sinking on point...
Love it 🤣🤣
so basically, lebron said some words and the refs helped with the ejection
This lame doka cheated on nia long with sum plain jane 😂. Lebron should crush him with his wallet
good lip reading analysis coach
According to sources, Ime got heated after James told him, "You may be a nympho, but I'm a FREAK!"
Tia Long! Tia Long! Tia Long!
uh... well, for a guy that crowned himself, I gotta say LBJ had been soft at times (perhaps occasionally) in the past.
Everything about this is so soft, but the personal beef is a good point, that’s probably where it stemmed from
so good at breaking down
LeBron got black and white games, he's been in the league so long lol
That seetgeek ad placement....😂
Ime wanted to be part of Lebrons legacy.
this is how old LeBron is
This beef is all on Ime end. Bron feet was up at the Rams game, he don’t give an ounce of a damn
Nick is so good at breakdowns he started breaking down on court beef 😂
The year of beef!
Eason should be the one with tech 😂
Lebron needs to retire he’s not winning anything anymore he had a great career
