Claws? 😂
Hilarious Christmas gag, maybe try selling the bag of milk with pre dipped cookie's?  By the way, your mew haircut is sooo sharp....keep it, it suits you mate!😊❤
He should ask for higher price for the signed Santa's. It's very special.
Ol boy really puts himself up on a pedestal
black man " i hate this job"
That dude was like “oh no, not this shit again.”  The bag of milk had me gone.
And a _bag of milk_ 😂 I can't believe he didn't go for it. For 50 bucks that's a steal!
"Why is this man playin in my face??"
That dude looks like his life is just miserable and he's ready to end it at any minute now

I like how the guy is looking away, hoping he would leave hahahahaha

It's honestly crazy how prude people have become. The way people talk like the kid was serious, shows how seriously dumb indeed these people really are.
A signed picture of Santa ia priceless
Signed photograph of Santa and a bag of milk😂😂😂
That guy looks like Greydon Square lol
I love it when the employees tell / vent about their experience to the “next person in line” who is actually the cameraman lol 😂
LMAO santa 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Just find this channel and fricking love it 😄😄
Classic
This could definitely sell at this indoor yard sale stand.
Big props to the pawn shop owner. 👏🏾  Very patient and understanding that it was just a joke.I 💥💢💯👍🏾
Notice the samurai swords on the floor....
He's like "this dude doesn't look like a crackhead, why the F is he trying to sell me milk?"
Bro finally got the milk 🥛
Milk in bag? How Canadian is that?
One thing though...That sales person...whether if it's his shop or not needs to put those swords out of reach of the Customers 🙏.
“Mmm mmm mmm MMM”🤣
You can tell that man doesn’t like white people.
That desk so big compared to him I thought he was a child
The man said 👁👄👁 when he put the phone on the counter 😂
🤣🤣🤣
Bagg of milk tho
Coke bruuuuuuuuh
I died when he brought out the bag of milk
I love that guy hahaha
He has the face of "I've seen enough shit in my life, but then again there's this guy..."
M m
Id would so snag up that Santa pic.
Omg I’ve never laughed so hard at anyone 😂 I absolutely love this guy . Reminds me of my son .
Everybody knows of exhaling though your nose when you see something funny, but I literally made a farting sound with my mouth at “a bag of milk.”
😂
Do the same thing but have some one else go in first and ear drop and after he rejects your stuff have them buy them at that high price..
Would have been more funny if someone walked in after he left and said they would have bought those items for that price 😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
This dudes high ass counter. I bet people leave all kinds of shit way the fuck up there.
That dude looks like jayz
He instantly knew that the bag of milk was pure foolishness.😭😂
"mm mm"😂😂
The signed photo of Santa should be worth something
That was the nicest bag of milk he's ever seen in his store though.  He really missed out.
The milk was killer! ❤️🤣💯
A bag of milk    That got me so there LOL
Do one wear you try to sell Dwayne Johnson’s used condom
Mhm mhm mhm
Either that's milk, or he put a BUNCHA practice into that bag.
You should have gotten all interested in the items and turned the joke around on him.
Crack head sales everything must go
Pawnshops pull random numbers out of their ass
I broke out laughing when he broke out the bag of milk 🤣
I have to pass lol
A bag of milk lol
“You stand to make a profit on this”  *pulls out a bag of milk* 😂😂😂
I thought the bag of milk was drugs lol
should have sent a friend later that day to ask if he is selling milk or a signed picture of Santa and offered a lot of money
"Mmh-mmh"😂😂😂
Is this what millennials do?
You stand to make a profit Proceeds to pull a packet of milk
$535 bucks
Is this what not having social anxiety is like?
J
666
“I’ll have to pass 😳🥴”
Oh my god oh my god oh my god 😂😂😂😂😂
I feel sorry for the people who hang out with you recording these lame shorts
Why do I think of Ben askren when he said bag of milk
why are all the money signs in the wrong place
I'd have bought Santa Claus signed photo for 29 cents. 1 cent for the milk. Just to get him out of the store 🤣
You stand to make a profit it
Bruh just leave the man alone
Dude has no sense of humour
I died when he pulled the milk out
Looking down from the heights there wow.
They have like no humor
He didn't take it ? What ?? That picture is worth the $535 and even more. Also are you kidding me ? Milk is essential for this Christmas for Santa's cookies.
They literally sell bags of milk in canada
Mm mm.
I cant stand people who make jokes wasting people’s time but yet I still find it funny
😂
Kid selling looks like the little bro in lizzie McGuire
Why waste peoples time

Idk man Canadians love bag milk. They would totally buy that.
Actually the way things are going the bag of milk might actually be valuable
I would buy that Santa Auto.
smh i farted
This “guy” is actually an elf and that is a completely legitimate photograph of Santa and that’s amazing milk from very special reindeer that can produce a whole lot of milk 🥛 unlike normal reindeer which is still very good milk btw 👍 🙂oh, And that’s a regular sized counter in case you don’t believe a word you just read. Happy holidays guys! Stop being a douche.
The King of Pawn Shops!  Look at his thrown so fucking high up lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pretty sure that's not milk
The shop owners the real hero of this story
Him: *trying to sell a milkbag* Me: "Smitty! Noooo!"
I love these kind of pranks. Nobody gets hurt or angry. Maybe a little annoyed and a little time wasted. I'm sure he had a laugh about it later.
Omg he got a picture of Santa clause 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤣🤣🤣🤣
I agree with the black guy: This was a waste of time for everybody involved, ourselves included.
In screaming 😂😂😂💀💀💀
LMAO 🤣🤣❤
And a bag of milk so black dads can finally go home for Christmas with their family
Cringe-worthy dude. Awkward and not funny.
😂😂😂
This guy is awful
Literally watchn drugs inc. the fix & i stumbled on to this while taking a  toilet break 💩🚽🧻
Some people just need go get a sense of humour!
The guy be looking like a judge 👩‍⚖️  with that tall desk😂 🤣
He just had to get that Santa picture and I'm dead!🤣😭🤣😭🤣
Cameraman still has the invisibility potion
Thief walks in with a bag of loot.. after he leaves
He was flipping the game on them.  My bros and I only got $5 for Super Mario Brothers NES at a pawn shop “That’s all it’s worth”, they said. Came back later to see our game up for $25.
Uhm uhm
Bro I love how the cameraman is invisible
Invisible cameraman
Firstly, that desk looked like my brother's bunk bed. Wonder if he sold it. Secondly, it would've been funny if the guy he's complaining to in the end pulls out a way more ridiculous stuff to sell 😂🤣🤣😂
Honestly I would've paid 700 for the Santa picture so he missed out on profiting
Mystery box will make you go to the top on YouTube just saying
Homie is NOT about it xD
Imagine not having a job and wasting people’s time all day
Here I have the spear that impaled Jesus Christ before his crucifixion This guy: m m 😑
you should've payed a different person fo walk in and say their in the market for a signed picture of Santa clause 😂
Imagine when he finds this on YouTube 😂😂
This is not weird for a pawn shop
Lil durk???
Keep going, im egging you on.
"Rapunzel! I have something to sell!"
Again that kid with his bs... boring...
the look of disgust after he said ill have to pass LMFAOOOO
Do one where the  next guy in line has even more ridiculous items  lol
This guy's whole vocabulary: m m
When did my girlfriend started recording clips for this man 🤔
Why do people think this shtt is funny?
Wait till next year. With the rate of inflation, this could be a bargain! Let’s go Brandon!
So far he's only I seen that didn't immediately call the cops.
Santa Claus autograph 😂
The bag of milk had me duying bro 😂 he good with it tho.. legit sounds serious
uh uh
Bag o milk
I think Canada actually does do bags or milk though right?
BIG ASS COUNTER
You should get a friend to go in after and say “im willing to pay 25,000 for a signed photo a Santa, with his bag of milk”
Why is he so high up
Where do we sign up to vote for the Oscars?  Legend 😌👌  🥔🎹
😂😂😂😂when he shakes his head
😂🤣😂😂🤣😂
😂😂😂😂
💀 ☠️
Jesus loves you all and died for our sins give your life to Jesus Christ before is not to late God wants to save you from eternal suffering ❤️✝️🙏
for yt algo
It’s 100% authentic. 😂😂😂
Idk, but Ive never found this guy's videos funny at all. But it keeps on popping up in my shorts. Fuck me
Fucking HILARIOUS  I'm love it
Can you stop wasting people's time? You aren't even funny
Your not gifted to create funny tape . You should stop .
There are no genuine reactions, just people annoyed since they know he’s trolling since the cameraman is blatantly recording.
That Santa Claus got me fucked up😂😂😂
I hate the way black people always have this judgemental "I'm cooler than you" attitude
Idiots who think they are funny. Then find out it’s cringe and not the first idiot to think of this idea as if it’s original or funny
No lie but currently (before my comment) there are 535 comments on this video. Nice coincidence haha
I dont know Rick the bag of milk looking like a solid deal
😂😂😂
Smashed his brain in 🤣
Hey anyone know where I can find a coat like the other guy was wearing?
This is Vlog Creation level 😂
Did not pass the vibe check. Dude is too serious
Uhm uhm
Seriously a bag of powder milk that looks like something else you get my drift
I'd be heated
People are so grumpy just relax
This is the only one of this dude's videos that I actually find funny
This is the stupidest shit , cancel my u tube now
A bag of milk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Once again cameraman is invisible
I was waiting to see the cookies 🍪
Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas 🎁🎄
I’m dead💀💀💀💀
dude the guy always sounds like he’s being dead ass it’s so funnyyy😭😭😭
He looks like you already annoyed him in the past like when you come up to him he just doesn't have the energy for you
Cameraman : 😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
I'll put the milk up for $50. You never got it...
If i was the pawn shop I’d make em pay to film this garbageeee
He wasn't having any of it.
What the hell is that desk dude. Geez shady ass pawn shops.
Come on leave people alone
Grab one of the swords he just leaves at the front for when people feel like robbing him 🤣
Try to sell The buzz light year
Oh I get it...the cameraman is john cena
Talk about keeping it cool.
Claus isn't spelled with an E! lol
Mm mm …. Mm mm
CameraMan 👀
The cameraman was disguised as a bucket of steam!!
If ya ever feel useless remember the existence of this cameraman.
All for the cause of video 🙄 . Such has come to lives of human being this days.
Why is the counter so high? Has to be some way of intimidating the people into selling shit cheap lol. Like a power trip
So you want to buy some crack???
Bro why’s he so high up lol
People take themselves way too seriously.  Have fun with it! I would've offered $.05 for the Santa and you pay me $5 to dispose of your bag of milk.
This one was funny
My guy was tired of life
He would have been better off saying it was breast milk= to liquid gold. 😏 😂
That milk wasn't really milk!  LMAO
The only thing came to mind was WTF!!.....
Idea: try to sell a random over priced item as usual and then later someone comes in the store asking if they have the said random over priced item for a high price
Why do you go in and waste people time? It's not funny just annoying
You’re not funny find something else to do
Shop owner needs to know it was a joke or he may question his life choices forever
You can tel by his face he’s used to this crap
0:07 LMFAO....signed photo of Santa..100% authentic.... if i'm reading those letters correctly, he's even spelt his own name wrong..lol. "Clause" ??.
Is the Santa photo still for sale?
He turned his head immediately when he said bag of milk. He wanted to laugh bad as hell
Excuse me, what?
Should’ve had someone go in after asking for a signed picture of Santa willing to pay like $10,000
damn the cameraman got active camo 😱
Man this guy is really fun
Why that clerk look insulted? I sold a fender bass guitar, about 25 dvds and 2 big ass knives and agreed to only get $40.00 at a local pawn shop once. I go back in the next week, the bass I sold was up for $150, dvds for $5 each and don't remember what the knives were priced at 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 fucking pawn shops
I think I’m the only fourty year old loving this . So outrageous !
He has seen many of a Crackhead in his day
That dude is so waiting for his next fix aka profit
The second guy should have asked surprised, if he bought the Santa picture and if he woulld sell it for 10k... Just to shock the owner. 😁
The Santa bro.... So Good
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He acts bored like he does this all day. At the end his eyes are scary.
Ok this one is funny, the rest are ridiculous, find a different bit bro your pretty annoying
Lame.
Why did I think he said "a bag of dope" 😂
Pawn shops workers always has an  Attitude lol
Dis nigga😂
Cameraman: 👁👄👁📹
Epic !!!
A bag of milk🤣
The cameraman should try selling his invisibility cloak. Should get a decent amount for it.
A bag of milk would be clutch rn
It would be funny if a week later they go to the shop with a different actor and ask for a signed pic of Santa willing to pay up to $600
It would've been funny af if the second guy pulled out a bag of milk and was like, "So you don't buy bags of milk? Dang"
What is it with you people? Are you looking to get your asses kicked or do you not have any common sense? Try using your brain and coming up with content that is actually good
santas signature is well worth that amount...
Lol lmao 😹😹
The Employed man behind the counter is rude if you ask me.... He must also have a very small vocabulary because his response's are noise's
Dude fucking leave him alone
Pawn shops are the biggest crooks around soooooo.
Bring these type of pranks back. More wholesome, less toxic.
some people just ain’t suppose to be funny like bro you is suppose to work in a cubical u not fuckin funny bro
“Let’s waste peoples time for a video.”
Blacks are much more tolerant
Yo this guy's desk is a power play hahaha
The signed picture of Santa had me rollin lol
White people think wasting working people's time is cute
Guy at the counter seems like the most boring person in existence
Guy at the counter seems like the most boring person in existence lol
Guy at the counter seems like the most boring person in existence lol
😂😂😂😂😂 why is this so funny
I want the signed picture of Santa.
😐
You should stop doing these. You’re going to get yourself hurt playing with the wrong people
Somebody should have come in and asked for those specific items. Hearing that they were going to be there and that they're very valuable and they had $10k to work with to try and buy them...
When they gotta set the counter to look down on you? That's some serious inferiority complex right there.
These aren’t even funny, just annoying kids wasting my time
You should have sent someone In like an hour later asking for one of those items
If it was Cambodian tittie milk I heard P Diddy would buy n drink that🤣
Doing nonsense things for the sake of views and worst part is u made the other guy look stupid.
Bag of milk hell yea paying €20000 for that
He is just making workers day worse
Cameraman: "I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still, that I become invisible to the eye"
Dude was done with this when he started
Why am I laughing so hard at this wtf
😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂
This has me dead
This is easily the best reaction I've seen from one of these vids that face after the bag of milk where he's trying to hold his sanity in😂
A bag of milk 🤣🤣
Mhm mhm
That’s hilarious
So cute I love Santa 🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸♋♌♐♏♂️♀️♂️♀️♂️♀️♂️🔢🔠🔡1️⃣3️⃣3️⃣4️⃣5️⃣6️⃣7️⃣8️⃣9️⃣🔟
Leave that dude alone. People like you are so fucken annoyed
Lol it's funny how it's a black guy just giving him that quit playing look and then hes looking down on him also bwahaha
I mean 50 bucks for a bag of milk ain't bad
This is the funniest one so far
No one can be that stupid
Ha haaaa
He did not pass the vibe check
Ok hold up im subscribing
Me: I want to have the power of flight Cameraman:invisible
guy can’t take a joke
For $50 he could finally return home to his family.
He looked pissed off... Definitely not entertained!
So do you pay the people you try to turn into entertainment?
Lol
I actually fudging laughed 😅. Congrats that is hard to do.
💀💀
I work at a pawn shop. I can confirm I see a lot of shit
I like that slight chuckle in the background 😂😂
" You stand to make a profit..." 😂😂😂😂asshole 😂
Jesus take a joke bro
Whack
That’s funny.. good 👍
They only take packs of razors and electric toothbrushes from heroin addicts so they can sell them on full price online
It would have been funny if someone came in after looking to buy those items for double the price.
This dude deserves a medal for not bursting out laughing when he pulled out the milk😂😂😂
Keep them coming my boi. Annoy more people. Don’t let them do their job peacefully, all for your precious view counts. Keep up the good work.
Where da punch line?
When the guy covers his beard up he looks like marcel to me
Shoulda of bought it Santa is real!!!!!!😂
Dude didn't even find it funny. Where was the punchline tho? At least if it had a funny twist or a funny pitch. Here he just sounds like he's working out stand up comedy ideas
What does this guy actually do for work besides bother hard working people with his terrible videos
God why can't people take jokes anymore wth
Could’ve been a solid $585
So he just walk around every day aggravating people with dumb stuff! I wish his videos stop popping up!
That cashier already wasn't putting up with that shit before the dude even started talking 🤣
That desk is high up for judgement.
Nothing like a spoiled scumbag kid bothering a man at his place of work.
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Lmao he looks so confused
The cameraman probably drink a potion of invisibility
I love this guy😅🤣...so his effort is 100..
He was so rude
Hahahahahahaaaaa
You should have sent someone in with a big stack of cash asking for a bag of milk and a signed photo of Santa
I love the milk part
That Clerk looks like an Actor, I just can't remember his Name.🤔
The funniest thing in this whole thing is people really do think it's real
Is this in Kalamazoo??
I would just walk away.
Why is this jerk wasting people precious time . I would refuse entry to my store if I ever see him again.
That dude either has no sense of humor, or gets crazy ass crack heads strolling through all the time
Jeeze man, people need to learn to laugh.
How does he do this with a straight face 😂
The dude had 0% Christmas spirit or happiness in him...he defo regrets not buying the signed picture
Haha, this guy is too funny man
Dude go home look in his refrigerator , damn I should of got that milk 😂😂
Twist plot: this was actually an authentic signed photo of the Santa 😂
Negotiable domination is key
Dude couldn't even look at the bag of milk.
Cringe and staged
😂😂😂💛🌍
That's fkn great
Ok, try n be funny but don't go wasting people time and money who are actually working for a living . Not blogging
Why do you waste people’s time with stupidity? Not funny 😑
Why do you people do stupid stuff like this? Do you kids enjoy makin a fool pf yourself? I bet yall's moma's are real damn proud!  I'd dis-own your ass!!
Most people would realize you're messing with them, but pawn shops get the strangest people trying to sell the strangest things so to him it was just another monday
Aye the signed picture of Santa is funny as fuk
White people be trippin’
Should have someone go in after and ask if they have a signed picture of Santa signed. And say I got a grand for one lol
This dude stayed super calm during this nonsense
Wtf is this store setup
If he would have said 5$ i would buy that santa photo
Bro could smile at least.. he's really living sad life if he can't find some happiness in it
The high ground ?
"Cocain  is a hell of a drug "
Some people are so lost in there little world they really can’t tell when someone is messing with them. Dude genuinely thought you wanted to sell him milk. Wow
Quit wasting working people's time. Jfc.
The guy working is the star of this
Buddy talking smack about customer after he leaves is hella rude like buddy needs a reassessment of the way he acts
His face said he already knew you were on some bull..and that high ass desk is not unnoticed
I've seen him going to a lot of places like that and for some reason I could not stand this dude
You should go into a pawn shop and try to sell a child
He should have had someone come in before asking for ridiculous things to buy. Then the two meet.
“With the Christmas seasons”😂😂
How small is this town he live in?
This man wants to slap the punk out of this kid and I'd be ok with him doing it
Finally this man starts to get some traction like the man has some legendary content💯
Haha it's a 100% authentic
And a bag of milk hahaha yeah
I want the signed picture of Santa I got the same one hahahaha
You should of had a friend go in there after looking to spend big money for a bag of milk
Apparently, Santa can’t spell his own name correctly…
Some one needs to fire the black dude bc he looks like he hates life
Yep its hilarious to aggravate people at work 🥱
Okay I do feel sorry for the guy.  Imagine having to deal with this nonsense.
Lol
Bruh I couldn’t stay serious
Um this is NOT entertainment
Maybe the stupidest video I’ve ever seen!!
He should buy the camera man's invisibility cloak.
This actually funny 🤣
So he didn’t notice the same camera man standing in the same spot.. lol
Why he look just like 50kalmal?😂
Was really hoping the next guy was gonna try some more bogus items.
This is just ridiculous
Can’t believe he forgot the bag of chocolate cookies to sell.
Lol next time just have something valuable in the bag of milk
He wasnt in a laughing mood at all
Why does every employee at the pawn shops seem to be aggravated?
I was hoping Shaq walked In...I bet you he would have bought the bag of milk$$$
I love black people fr they will tell you about the craziest shit even if you dont know them personally
I love black people fr they will tell you about the craziest shit even if you dont know them personally
I hate when people go video other people who clearly don’t want to be on video, it is a violation to there privacy.
how absurdly stupid do you have to be to get mad at these pranks? You'd think the kids that think they're above jokes would grow the hell up.
Good thing the cameraman invisible
Yah because humor doesn't connect with this guy at all 🤣
Your lucky, he tried to sell me Santa Clause and a Cow 😜
And he doesnt the camera in his face
Bag of milk? No way.. Ring I just beat someone to death for..how much u want??
👎
*Should of had someone else get in the shop later and ask for the Santa autographed photo that they'd pay top dollar for it*
The cameraman actually lives there
How could he not laugh at this?
What he should do is actually have someone who wants those items lol
Dame he didnt take any of that stupidity good for him. May he never have to experience something as dumb as this again.
A decent prafit
This video made me check to see if someone came into the house
Bro forgot the cookies 🍪
guy aint even funny
That man thinks he’s seen it all and he is so patient
Didn't he get it was a joke? Looks like he actually thought you were stupid.
If I was the next dude I would have been like “wait, your not buying bags of milk, shit!”
Who else is on an endless loop of shorts😂
Ah yes fucking with a working man for laughs, what a great way to spend time
Funny
That store owner is an oak...
Bruh 😂
I love how he just looks away when dude pulls out the bag of milk. 😂😂. Plays it sooo cool. Smart guy… he doesn’t know if this guy is crazy or what. Nicely done hahaha
😂😂😂😂
I don’t understand what you were trying to get at?
Plot twist: this man is actually from a universe where lying does not exist. and he was kidnapped while he was sleep after a crazy adventure in his own universe, and he still thinks he’s there! And that actually is Santa Claus‘s actual signed photo because in his universe Santa Claus actually exist. also in his universe cows are the rarest thing in the whole entire Cosmos even rarer than antimatter, so milk is basically the equivalent to an infinity gauntlet. So  yeah this guy just really really really missed out🤷🏾
People like this store dude make this world a shit depressed place
does people really thinks this is funny or its quality content?!?
👀 👀 and a bag of milk
I fckin died when dude said a signed photograph from Santa omfg that was awesome 🤣🤣
props to the cameraman for not getting caught
😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was stupid!! What was the point in not even funny!!
Ha ha ha. So hilarious. Someone remind me to laugh
Would be hilarious if they sent someone in asking for a signed picture of santa clause
He should have sent someone in there to ask if they have an autograph picture of Santa and a bag of milk for sale
...SOLD
Hell yeah
Bro you need a step ladder to pay for something
When he said  "Sssssccchhhhhsshhchhchshhchhsh" I felt that
His counter is high because he likes to look down on people
The cameraman as always, invisible.
He dead ass brung expired dairy
The bag of milk is what got me 😂 you stand to  make a profit 😂😂😂
People actually think it’s real and that separates us.
Some people take their lives too seriously, I’d have laughed my ass off
His loss.... can't make money doing business that way bro
Corny..
Should've had a rich guy walk in afterwards asking for some santa pictures or milk
He thought he was a tweaker 😅😅😅
Bring it to me  I will buy it from
Coca cola santa
A bag of milk 🥛
Straight up wasting people's time
Bro really brought a bag of Milk 🤣😂
Fk that guy would offer you 80 for a ps5 😂 with 5 games
Yo, I'd take that bag of milk.. 🥛
Sorry ill buy that signed photo of santa. Thats pretty funny!
How do u pass on a signed pic of santa.... like how tf dpes that not go up in value
The way he looked into the camera like: *you better be paying me bc I can so see you and it’s hard to act like I don’t bc you are not using the Minecraft invisibility potion man!*
You just got beaned
Us Canadians will take that bag of milk😌
How dose he not laugh broo
Oh my god. I cried laughing

Why you wasting this dudes time
you couldve gotten away with selling the milk in canada

That bag of milk made him uncomfortable..  He was like I ain't  even gonna look this crazy fuck in the eyes. .
Try and sell a shriveled up piece of meat or skin and say it's your foreskin 😂
Get the fuck out 😅😂😅😂😅😂
Respect to the cameraman using there last invisibility potion on this
You should’ve had a buyer come in looking for some milk and a signed picture of santa
I want to do that now
Should have showed later dressed as Santa looking for that picture and some milk willing to pay top dollar
Bruh these people can’t be taking a joke here and there.
As a ex drug addict I can tell you pawn shop employees have no sense of humor
Hey boss man I need break! (Pats my pockets) where my lighter?
I had a crack head offer to sell me stolen power tools. After I said no he offered to sell me a Walmart bag full of cooked chicken. I said no and he got very upset and insisted I buy the chicken over and over again. 😐
I love the signed photo of Santa 🤣
That boy's thirsty got milk
But why is the counter so high though😅😅
"A bag of milk"  *Oh Canada starts playing*
This guy not know what comedy is? Lighten up buddy
I love how he just looks away and ignores him after he pulls out the bag of milk 😂🤣💀
Hahaaahah excellent  !

No low ball offers. I know what I got here folks
You can tell he had enough that day or even being the pawn shop emplee or owner you can tell by his face he mustve dealt with this alot
The signed picture of Santa is a treasure Karma
He was so unimpressed
My man kept his cool lol
Go to pawn stars when they are filming
So the camera man’s invisible?
What is pawn shop dude is wearing 😂😂😂😂😂
Own the Milk for 50 pawn dealer Face was Priceless 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂♥️

Send him to Vegas to be put on to an episode of pawn stars. See how he does. He may have better luck.
And the camera guy I just invisible I guess
Jonh cenas brother at it again filming without getting noticed
You scholar try selling a loaf of Bread that looks like a flip flop and say you have the tomasjefersons
At least this looked authentic.  Santas autograph is not easy to find

The cameraman: 👻

Camera man… heh heh heh
Signed picture of Santa is original. 🤣🤣💯
I wonder if he ignores everyone like that
Someone hates their job.
Ur friends should have went there and said I’ll give u 10000 bucks for a signed picture of Santa clause
When are people gonna realize the camera man uses a hidden camera and stop with the "invisible cameraman" comments? Sure, most vids like this tend to be faked, but not in this case. Its pretty obvious tbh, everyone is always terrible at acting in the fake videos yet he somehow finds a random amazing actor every single time? I dont think so lol
I love this guy!  (PM me to do a deal on the milk bag 👍)
As a Canadian I can confirm that bag of milk goes for about 5 bucks
make these full vids along with shorts go hard plus that fallowup prank was awesome
Stupid is stupid does..
Invisible cameraman huh
Fresh milk or old milk?
Invisible cameraman... AGAIN!!!      love ur content man keep it up
I live in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area and there are lots of interesting pawn shop stories.. you get the weirdest of the weird here.. I've seen people walk outside of pawn shops right around to the dumpster grab something to pawn shop threw out and walk in and try to pawn it.. with the pawn stickers still on it..
Brooo your content is so funny keep it up man ❤️
Signed pictue of Santa. Your killin me 🤣
I would buy a signed picture of Santa Claus

Cameraman must be John cena
Lmao 🤣
Nice.
Bro I love the shorts pls make a part 2 of this
That desk being so high up is a solid negotiation tactic.
This is my new favorite youtuber.💀
I know this guy isn’t gonna blow up and when he does I hope he doesn’t become a fake piece of sh1t like most people and instead keeps putting out genuine stuff like this because it’s funny as sh1t
Why is this so underrated
some people just dont know how to laugh. dude must be sad as fuck
😂🤣🤣
I have a photo of Santa I want 535

This channel is super underrated. Keep putting out hilarious content
The camera man is a pawn item
Thanks for being kind. Even if you thought it was a joke it didn't cost you anything.
