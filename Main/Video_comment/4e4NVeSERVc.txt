Imagine he gets traded to the Rockets for Jalen Green, Dillion Brooks, 10th pick in the 2025 draft, and 5 2nd round picks.
Downfall of the suns
Man this team will surely win championships❤
This is going to tough team to beat.
I can't look at Kevin Durant
Kevin Durant should of been traded to the New York knicks that’s who they need with this new squad , facts !
As a Rockets fan II loved this trade
I hope the suns win I want cp3 to win a ring
It's not competition when people can just go to any team.
“This is gonna be great”                                  -statement that doesn’t age well.
Can they win a championship
In hockey terms?
Finals prediction: Boston and Phoenix  Boston in 6
Can’t wait for the Warriors to beat them in 6 😅
KD said oh ky gone?! I’m for sure not staying here with Ben weak as 😂😂
Finally, Ben Simmons time to shine
He looks and sound like he’s not too sure of himself and nervous. Almost seem like he was forced to do this video. He didn’t mean any of it lol
Good move for Durant.👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿….Make that anti Black racist Joe Tsai pay for being a despicable individual and I hope he has the worst team in the NBA long enough for him to be forced to sell the team.  We don’t need racist Asians like him in a league that has a long history of team owners that are anti Black racists.
y'all should have left kyrie alone. He did nothing wrong. Now your racism has cost you a ring and the nets suck. I love it.
Suns need to pickup Pat Bev for defense.
Crazy sun's bout to come up after this trade
Kevin Durant ppg probably improve with CP3 opening the floor.
I still pick Nets to come out of the East
Dammmm what a crazy trade
On NBA 2K24 KD is gonna be on the ALL-TIME: Thunder, Warriors, Nets now Suns lmao
Don’t get me wrong. KD is a superstar but sacrificing the future for the past doesn’t work. Bridges was the heart and soul of this team with large amounts to grow. KD is past his prime. We didn’t need this. Did the new owner forget that this team was in the finals two years ago?
Worst team owner in basketball history. He did not protect his players
They had 3 players that didn’t play well as a team? An expensive experiment. It may be an opportunity for new stars to rise.
This trade completely shook up the NBA. The team in the desert is once again relevant in Championship contention. I definitely see Kevin Durant staying in Phoenix for atleast 3 years. Organization moving in a promising direction with an established young star in Booker
Why would you give so much for a 34 year old coming off a knee injury? Especially considering the injury issues with Booker and Paul. It's too bad, 1, 2 or all 3 will be out most of the time.
Until they prove something they're nothing remember they nets had Kyrie KD Harden and Simmons 🤷🏻
Can someone please tell me the music in the first 20 seconds in the background?? It's so melodious i wanna hear the whole beat
🤦
This is a better trade than Kyrie to Dallas. Luka doesn’t need another alpha😊 wannabe
The Nugget's road to the finals just got a whole lot bumpier.
That's one way to get CP3 a ring
Kevin durant will injure his chicken legs again and retire
Very ugly . No sportsmanship anymore.. Everyone is a Gold-digger , digging for more and more success .. No one is loyal to one Team , or one Human...
To be honest, if anyone can get CP3 a ring, gotta be KD. For the most part, they should try to emulate what the warriors did since they kept all their important young guy- 🥲  Anyway, this is just lesser Klay+Curry so Kevin should be able to cook, in short. This'll show where he was at with the original duo that could 100% keep up with him compared to this new pair. Splash+KD was truly a treat when it existed.
Kyrie gone too
Wait! So are we supposed to hate KD now too!?!  I’m so confused 😞
Hasn’t he played for every team in the NBA now?
Woj, you said that Nets are not interested in trading KD right?you said that KD is not available right? You should be the last person to break this down.
Wow
4 first round picks. Nets are already winning the assets market
i can’t help but wonder what’s going through Ben Simmons troubled mind right now.
East side sucks now all star teams for west side not even balance for NBA 🤣 sad 😭
Bahah stupids nets assembling the “emotional 3” and expecting it to work.
Awesome for the suns!
when is his debut?
Big Win for brooklyn if they draft wemby for an full rebuild, same for the Suns as KD will be tremendous in the playoffs
If healthy no team can beat them 4 times in a 7 game series...Happy for CP3 he's gonna retire with a ring...
When’s KD gonna play tho?
Imagine what Steve Nash must e thinking right now
nets owner lost his mind. bunch of juu owners gave that minority other than black to own a nba team. now you know why they did that. lmao.
KD can't win on his own.
Crazy thing would be if the Suns faced the Mavs in western finals and Kyrie lights it up and  they win the Series. He would be sending his friend home screwing him one more time :)  Poor Durant for being so loyal to that lunatic
My concern with the Durant -to- Suns trade is this: although both Kevin Durant and Devin Booker are excellent shooters and overall basketball players; yet, neither is a charismatic type team leader.  With me, the Phoenix Sun's team still does not have any 'backbone'.  ?What if the Sun's would of first deleted Chris Paul and then added (or in the future aquire) only two players from this list of eight: Anthony Edwards, Darius Garland, Josh Giddey, Jalen Green, Tyrese Haliburton, Tyrese Maxey, DeJoante Murray and/or Isaiah Stewart?
CP3 definitely has a chance to retire with a champion ring now. Ja Morant after hearing of the KD trade to the Suns.. I’m definitely not fine in the West! 😂
Don’t understand why Nets being over .500, yet Kyrie and KD not happy and get traded.
This can either be a SUPER NOVA or BLACK DWARF event. 😐
When they put that team together, I had the feeling it would not work, they brought one player too much and that player was Irving, Dinwiddie should have never been traded.
No one wants to play with Ben Simmons lol kd wasn't going to carry him either
Los Suns ganaran el anillo lo siento Celtics Tatum tendra que esperar
Whose gonna play for the  nets ? The ball boy ?
Without giving up Ayton too.
Being a great player has nothing to do with good GM and coaching skills . This is what ever person crying about the racial makeup of the NFL coaches doesn't get. It's also why allowing a bunch of guys with grade 8 level educations build teams around who they are friends are is a terrible idea
It’s crazy wasn’t he supposed to win without Steph lmao 😂
Cp,Db, and Kd wow
Chris Paul is a walking hospital gurney. He’ll never stay healthy though the playoffs.
There will be a 30 for 30 on the car accident that is the Brooklyn Nets
As if suns and mavs didn’t already have their game against each other circled. Suns in 4
Dang... Phx has to be the favorites to win now. I'm not even sure GSW, fully healthy, can beat this team. Booker and Durant?? Game over.
Charles was right about this being the most exciting trade deadline.
Jae Crowder finally got traded 😂
Another cheat team I'm so over this  4 super stars  one  team  people could never talk about lebron going to Miami  KD has done it twice o wait 3 times   don't forget the Irving and harden in Brooklyn he's very over rated  that's waak
Remember when Ben Simmons said it would be 'scary' to have all 3 in the court.....that lasted less than a year. BS needs to score 30 a game now and stop fouling out...bting back joe johnson and Steve nash
As a Sixers fan……hahahahahahaha….we tried to warn yas, but y’all knew better…..how’s Ben Simmons looking now dummies
the West is too strong now. Jokic, Curry, Luka, Kyrie, KD, Lebron vs Tatum, EMbiid and Giannis. Sikes.
Wow nothing like the all or nothing round!    imagine trading 4 first round picks and a slug of plays for Durant is kind of insane..  Lots of things can happen yet this season for injuries..
The injured suns
Kyrie breaks up another championship team.
Ben Simmons literally ruined the NBA. Everyone just trying to get away him which in turn changed the entire league.
Brooklyn nets are done will never win a chip😂
Ja morant quaking in his boots right now 😂
Phoenix suns think about bringing Danny Green
That Suns team better win a ring. Higher expectations with that roster!
The greater the expectation, the bigger the disappointment.   Chemistry will be the key.  Too much one on one ball?
i dont belive a word woj says anymore
I'm a big suns fan and idk if I like the trade yet or not 😂. KD 34 years old and they gave up that much for another aging star.. offense and no defense now? Lost all our best role players also gonna be interesting to see how the rest of the season plays out
😢😢
Risky poker move for Suns,  I was  a Suns fan because of Mikal, Now I am Nets fan:)
Three superstars bolted from the Nets and ESPN employees still think Sean Marks is great and Nets front office knows what they are doing.
Only way KD can win is being a bus rider. We saw how he couldn’t lead a team in Brooklyn.
Suns got robbed sheesh 🤧 smh lmao
If CP3 can’t get a ring after this, he never will.
Those 2  guys ruined the Nets.  NBA Has allowed certain players WAY TOO MUCH Power and you can look at the current state of the nets to see the end result of that.  Selfish me 1st MF’rs. Bottom line… getting paid is the priority, if they win , well, that’s nice too
Ben who?
The quick reset of a franchise in NBA history- Brooklyn Nets
Mikel bridges that is a big loss to Phoenix 😭😳a big time defense player
Is the player empowerment era officially over?
He had traded is he healthy now?
GD these guys are bald af
Happy we have moved
Bulls fail again
It’s like getting rid of trash bye kyrie and kd
Oof.. are the Nets even a real team? 😆
Think what the Lakers can get for lebron to rebuild with
Nets from having kyrie harden and kd to having ben simmons lol 😆 🤣 😂
I WONDER WHAT JA MORANT  have in his minds now , since he say the west he got no problem 😮
Brooklyn was just a pit stop
I WILL MISS YOU DEARLY MIKAL & CAM <3
kevin durrrgoat
Just to beat the Warriors 🤣
Mavs vs Phoenix series is gonna be wild!!!
Something about all these players moving around is unsettling. I kinda miss the old ways where guys stayed with their teams and let the ownership build around them over the years, Young guys want it now! I guess I'm not mad at that either,
Those guys look like a unicorn farts
IMO, Suns will average minimum 130 points per game, they are going to the finals.
I hope Mikal finds his way back to Phoenix
Would’ve rather kept bridges and got rid of ayton
Okay Luka . .
Suns just punched their ticket to the Finals with Kevin Durant
Nets didn't do too bad in getting back some good players and a load of draft picks.
Raleigh Simmons coached by Fred Tex Winter. If Kevin Durant is Healthy The Suns will win it all.
this demolishes kd's legacy
Wrong forum... but, I saw where somebody's watching this version, this incantation of the Los Angeles Lakers,  and determined-- in print, mind you -- that the Lakers play better without LeBron. LeBron, is the Lakers problem!!? Wow, can't make this up...
The drama queen at it again… im out! 😂
Did you guys hear about what happened to the Las Vegas WNBA team that was paying their players under the table? Yah, me neither.
Listen: The reality is... in 2023, hatin' is so commonplace that you're forced to respond like there is a legitimate question. So, that being said: Imagine if KD is LeBron! The outcry would be through the roof. His legacy would be tarnished. His platform diminished. Even if he were traded LeBron, cannot team with other top tier players. Stop it with Bosh top5 player. How about: where's Delavadova now?  Or... JR Smith? There are staunch LeBron haters who say this Lakers team is a super team!? The one thing the haters have right is: if LeBron,  on the roster it's probably "Super"...
Now it's Ben Simmons team
A lot of NBA players are getting traded this month and suns might make it to the finals with you know
That Net's big 3 is the most disappointing "Super Team" in NBA history.
Suns should grab melo
Wow Brooklyn
Im most happy for CP3 his odds  of winning a ring just received a boost.
My new favorite team let's go
The Suns still won’t win the West
Lol at Ben Simmons
What a disaster of an experiment by the Nets bringing Durant, Kyrie, and Harden. Together they played only 16 games! Now they are all gone.
Ben Simmons go to the Nets...everyone is jumping into the escape pods.
Lol.. Kevin Durant is now B team. That's so sad.. Just like Seattle SuperSonics... if only, perhaps could have been a franchise player. Another one looking around for a team. Go warriors. Lol
I’d like to remind everyone KD was on the team with Kyrie AND Harden and then Kyrie AND Ben Simmons and it amounted to a big pile of nothing.
That's crazy, nets was playing decent and  in 3rd place. Giannis 😱 them all smh!! Man that's crazy how they fear him ...Mayne they was scared of Boston too.
Wow this gonna be insane
Wow!!! The West is the Best. Wonder if Ja Morant is still only concerned by Celtics. 😅
What if the problem was KD not Kyrie or the organization. We'll see hiw this playoffs ends
Crazy
YAAAAAY!!!! I LOVE Kevin Durant going to The Suns with Devon Booker & CP3!!! Ok Western Confrence.....It's On and Poppin with The "Suns New Big #3!"🤯🧨🧨🧨 🔥 🔥 🔥 👊💥👊💥👊💥🏆🥇
tbh, it could be much better if it was Ayton that traded to Nets, not Bridges. as Suns fan, Bridges/Torrey is the only player (the main ones) that actually defending threes. we always so heavy on blocking people into rim but when it cames to zoning people outside paint is always the problem
Called it from the beginning. You put three toxic trash personalities and injury prone humans on the same court . It’ll never work!
The democrats should have added even more pork to the spending bill. This could have been avoided. We need funding to eradicate the cancer that is Ben Simmons. Instead we get to find out if Thanos really could snap his metal fingers.
Ben Simmons should asked to be traded now
LET'S GO SUNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[4] 1st rounders!!!???  Suns have an irresponsible front office.
Nets are great team now with young guys who will prefer to work with eachother look for Michael bridges cam, cam, and Claxton to really make a name for themselves on brooklyn
KD really loves his brothers. Went from the "splash" brothers(Curry and Klay) to the "dribble" brothers(Kyrie and Harden) to now the "choke" brothers(CP3 and Booker)
If his knee stays healthy it helps them, but now their depth is down significantly. Still doesn't do anything to match up with a healthy Nuggets roster, they still have the home court advantage by a handful of games. Especially when Denver has one of the easiest strength of schedules left, while Phoenix has one of the most difficult.
Memphis wants to be part of the east right now 😆😆
Dam !!! Bridges is probably PISSED!!!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬
Haha did Woj just call SVP, “Kevin”?!
Main mission is to bring back bridges to the suns, getting back cam Johnson would be a plus
We have a new championship contender.
and this my friends is how u win a championship...
The Nets seem like they are Punting the rest of the season. At least you have the New York Yankees and NYCFC to look forward to (also the New York Islanders).
Suns has The Big 4 - Booker, Ayton, CP3, KD - Potential championship title - Team USA Olympics
LeBron two point no LMFAO
Harden, Irving, Durant all played a total of 16 games together. Experiment failed.
Am i crazy or is nobody really talking about the fact this is kid leaving to a (near) championship team again? He got so much hate for the warriors but the trade to the suns trade has been little in backlash
Cmmon bro the league was just starting to even out now the west stacked again
Bad day to be a Nets fan
This look like Brooklyn didn’t have the money to pay their stars due to lack of fan support.   If this team didn’t get to the finals and only go to the second round theirs no point to pay all that money.   Brooklyn had less expensive players and still got there.   Who ever decision was to go to Brooklyn didn’t really think about the business on the east coast post Covid hit New York areas hard.
Ring chaser Durant 😂 . He’s the biggest crybaby in sports .
Lets see if KD is healthy...
Chris Paul about to finally get a ring
3 snakes together finally
im fine in the west 😂 i wonder now
This is an all or nothing trade by the phoenix suns, if they lose this year its gonna be Brooklyn 2.0 guaranteed. That being said, the Suns have a real chance now
TJ Warren will be needed,if the sun's stay healthy they have a good chance for the rings this year
It’s crazy that superstars like these are easily being traded but you’ll never see Lebron, Curry or Dame be traded. I was going to say Kawhi but he got traded by the Spurs.
You either have a great starting 5 in the NBA or you have no starting 5 and very good bench players. There’s no in between.
As a cavs fan I’m excited. They just gave us that 4 seed 😂
Welcome everybody to the wil wild West 🤠
Breaking News, Ben Simmons request a trade to WNBA
Kd, i’m taking my injuries to the Suns
Nba is not the same long time ago, this players go and change teams like every month is a joke plus no big deal they are not even playing because always injury lol waist of money.
nets fell apart just as quick as my relationship
Glad I didn't have Nets season tickets
Sheesh 4 1st rd picks
Now we get to see how truly bad Ben Simmons is wo Kyrie
To be honest,  the Nets might have made out in the long run. They got 5 first round picks between trading Kyrie and Durant and a bunch of young talent.
If one "superstar" crys and demands a trade. It's all  🐒 see 🙈 do.
KD to the Suns is incredible, Suns are stacked 👏👏👏👏
I’m calling it right now, Dallas will win this year!
Nets for now have the Cam Connection. Cam Bros.
Nets are backstabbers 😂😂😂
Sorry, but Chris Paul will never win a championship!!!! He has the worst luck, same with James Harden!
Terrible terrible trades going on lmao. Hope these teams fail just simply because they are superstar hunting. And if you haven’t seen by now, doesn’t work
Now I could like the Nets again.
No one, so long as KD stays healthy. Period
Nets are Cam Thomas’s team now
I can’t wait for the mavs vs the suns
🔥🔥🔥🙌
What a joke. They were just saying they had no intention to trade KD and he also had no intentions. I had to double check if today was April 1st
KD’’s 2nd weakest move! - Stephen A. 😅
They need to get rid of the owner; im happy for Phoenix🎉
dude NEts were doing so well!. why change all of sudden? lol
No way 😮
lol imagine having durant irving and harden and by the end of the season your stuck with ben simmons 😂
Suns gave up 2 very good role players that were key for them in being a contender. On paper they’re the favorite in the west now but we Weill see . Bridges and cam were good defenders
whaaaaaat?
The nets not getting Ayton is crazy.
The sun's ain't going to beat the Denver Nuggets 🏀
If I were a Brooklyn Nets fan, I'd be in shambles. Never seen a spectacular failure on this level. In the ruins they have...Ben Simmons. Only good news is that Cam Thomas should now have the keys and they can fully see what he can do with Bridges.
GG. Suns wins 2022-23 NBA championship
Well looks like ticket prices in Phoenix just went up like nasdaq
Im not going to lie, the nets team now actually looks better... especially off the court. With thomas and now spencer and bridges... they were also gifted the 5th seed so honest i think they can work in the playoffs.
Thanks for your contributions and best of luck Mr bridges..
Crazy trade! Losing Mikal and Cam is tough, but the unprotected picks are risky considering Paul is on the decline and what the team could look like in a few years. I'm split on how I feel about it. Wish we could've kept Bridges.
Ok😅
Good for the nets
And they kept ayton! Wow ..only problem is the main 3 are never 100% healthy🤨
What a waste of time for the nets.
Just saw this. WHAT?!  Never expected this. These guys are now the automatic favourite
Maybe the team can jell & win WITHOUT a so-called "STAR".
The sun's will 3 peat it's over with. Kevin got an entire squad a young booker and Ayton. Lol y'all don't realize this over with now. New dynasty in town. Mavs not a discussion. Booker too nice and Ayton is a beast.
Nets you are a joke
If I'm Brooklyn I'm signing Shariffe Cooper
NBA is just a clown show with manbabies. So glad I've stopped watching it and can spend my money on other stuff.
“Nets have no intention to trade KD” - Woj 24hrs ago
I’m waiting on Supreme Dream to react to this lol
Ja: We're fine in the west West: Hold my beer!
I'm glad my dudes got away from that racist @$$ owner of the Nets. I wouldn't be surprise if anyone wants to play for that clown..
I wouldn't have done that trade if I was the nets if ayton isn't included.
As a fan of nets, I requesting a trade as well.
OMG, Phoenix is going to be lit. Now they got KD to play with Devin Booker. I ❤ it. Kyrie is in Dallas now. The west is going to be wild.
👀
Lebron is probably doing what he did in the Celtics game right now.
I'll miss you  Mikal 😓😓😓
Yaaaaaaaaaaa
Betweem KD and Booker that's alot of scoring on that team. I mean alot.  And it's scoring with the whole thing being directed by a all time great pass first PG. They could use Ayton as defensive specialist and switch him to multiple people because that guy can actually move his feet. This is a problem.
NBA ISNT A REAL PLACE ‘ THEY JUST HAVING FUN AT THIS POINT LITERALLY
This is the perfect move for Durant. With Paul and Booker already in the loop, he can do what he does best ... follow the leaders and fill up the stat book! I would also say the Nets issues have to make other owners take a step back and have a more cautious approach as it has now been proven that sometimes a book isn't nearly as good as its shiny cover.
…Anthony Davis to LA-Clippers..
Wait what???
I aged 33 years listing to woj 🐢
If the Nets were going to blow up the organization they should’ve just done it at the beginning of the season. They probably could’ve tanked and picked up Victor.
Lol wow wow 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥go suns
Are or did???
Kyrie,AD, KD, Chelsea lately, idc. Nuggets is 6
East becoming more and more Boston and bucks division, no one else.
KEVIN DURANT DESERVES ALL OF THIS!! HE IS TOTALLY SPINELESS!!  1ST HE LET A PIECE OF TRASH LIKE DRAYMOND (SHITBALL) GREEN RUN HIM OUT OF GOLDEN STATE !!! NO WAY SHOULD HE LET THAT HAPPEN!! 2ND SPINELESS MOVE HE LET A DIPSHIT LIKE RETARD KYRIE IRVING SABOTAGE THE NETS AFTER HE RAN AWAY FROM GOLDEN STATE!! DURANT DESERVES EVERYTHING FOR BEING SPINELESS!!!
KD is all fake man 🤣🤣🥱🥱
That’s crazy both the mavericks in suns half a tie record of 30-26 they’re definitely going to see each other in the playoffs… 💯
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good look for suns but don’t sleep on Brooklyn. Mikal, Spencer, Ben Simmons, Claxton, and those picks in the future
He is trash Kd can't win by hes own🤣🤣🤣
It really is crazy how Kevin Durant has played with Steph, Klay, James Harden, Kyrie Irving to now Dbook CP3 and Ayton in like a 4-year span. And not a single soul is gonna bat an eye to any of it either lmao
Nets fan deserve it 😂🖕
Hey Golden State you ain't the ONLY ones in the West loaded with All Stars now lol get ready
When kd get a super team he go all out😂😂
Hopefully, he comes in with the same mindset that he did at Golden State.
Looks like the nets are trying to get the no1 lottery pick. That gigantic center from France.
Warriors in 6
West was already so packed and competitive and now this?
Kd is a snake 🐍
The New York Mindset is broken and they are being exposed for what they really are. Starts with the failing left wing politics trickling down to sports.
Looking at this trade I can’t help but think Portland could’ve did this to get him with Dame. Would’ve at least been nice to hear they were attempting to make a move like that to help Dame
FLEECED
Nfs I think Kd threatened the gm of BK lmao. This is a trade that cpu would say „we feel disrespected with this offer“ type of shxt Lmaoo. How tf they keep their whole core and only had to give up bridges for KD?
Bro crazy af. They got a Rudy gobert deal.
Obviously getting KD is huge for the suns and makes them arguably the favorite to win the west. My only worry is they gave up really good role players. Crowder,Johnson and bridges were all hood bench players on that team. Suns may have some depth issues now. Only time will tell.
Disaster, who's watching the NBA?, what a joke league!!! Players are spoiled brats, who want to control the league. 2-5 years, it will be a defunct league. College ball have been more excited over the years. NCAA
KD playing tonight?
As great as KD is, I think the Suns gave up too much to get him. He’s well into his 30s and can’t stay healthy.
Wow. Just wow. Guess Nets had enough of all the BS.
NY will always belong to the Knicks
wow. so durant is back on rididng someone's cotail
Nets won. Just watch....
Oh my goodness suns fans
I wouldn't mind a Suns vs. Mavs series 🔥🔥🔥
WOW.
Ben Simmons is the new captain.
Y’all gotta relax kd is getting older and they lost dept and def
Good pick-up Suns.  Maybe championship material.  But you should not have got rid of Cam.  Gotta have that TarHeel flavor to win championships.
Suns and Mavs WCF easy
Nets should flip Bridges for a younger higher offensive potential piece and another first if possible. He's an amazing piece but in a rebuild I feel like it's wasting his game, Id flip him for Bones Hyland or Maxey if im the nets, and if Im Denver or Philly I'm fighting to get him
How many teams has Kyrie Irving blow up now? I count 3. And we'll see what happens in Dallas or wherever he ends up next year.
Bruv I prey my Cavs trade for one of those wing players, cam Johnson preferably.
I definitely didn’t see this coming!!!
Nah gonna happen, KD and CP3 gonna buck heads
I’ll bet money LeBron goes back to the East…
Mavs mad af right now, why didn't you trade us KD instead of kyrie??🤣
we knew this was gonna happen soon its up to cam thomas now
They gave up what?????
It would be funny if the nets win a chip.  :()
That’s not much of a return for nets
Snakes will always slither to the safest hideout
Lebron should’ve never signed that extension ,left after the season n signed w the cavs on a 1 yr only chance he got of making the finals
Lebron definitely not winning title now
O que tinha de legado foi pro krlh
The West is crazy!!
Only person nba wont allow to get help is lebron
Sad thing is KD hasn’t gotten a ring since being with the warriors
Nets saw that Cam Thomas is legit so now they add Cam Johnson, Bridges AND Crowder!!!! C’mon now Nets aren’t that close to the bottom
Why does he got to jump like that when he Speaks lol
Nets won this trade
Woj is really Thanos lol
Kyrie and Durant are gone now from the nets, what is going on with the nets right now.
KD. Man he lands in the worst places to live. OKC, Bay area, Brooklyn, and now Phoenix? Gross.
The east took a big hit on that one.
Imagine requiring KD and still loss in the playoffs 😬
KD is a baby 🍼🤣😂☺️🙂🤠
Rigged!!
Everyone running from Simmons 😂😂
This is huge for the rockets since they got pick swaps from the Harden trade
The nets juzt ridged tha league on purpose......i hope kyrie signs with the lakers tnext year
Nets Gon be good in the future no lie... They Gon prove em other teams wrong..I'ma Lakers fans bt bet warriors will dominate all teams
This make the bucks road to the champions even better two superstars went back west
Nets investing just like the Celtics did. 🤔
Cp3 with another chance….no excuses Ring or bust.
The Nets dumped two old men that are no longer rising stars, they made out like bandits!
Kd to the subs with CP and the crew booker , crazy !!!!
But kobe couldn't play with CP NBA 🗑️ and full of cry babies
I love how it takes only a few days for the western conference to be more stacked than the eastern conference
Dude it sucks so much to lose the twins!!
Who wanna take my beat both the Mavs and suns don’t win a chip 😂
If CP3 can't get the ring this season, it just ain't meant to be.
I'm putting my bet in now Suns vs Dallas conference finals
Woj bomb
and the west is stronger again
I give up on this league. All clowns ur all fkn clowns
It would nice to see suns play warriors in play in round 🐔🐍🐼
If this was the Knicks!!!!! OMG they would be getting destroyed but since it’s the Nets, media will give them a pass smh…..
warriors vs suns matchup  gonna be fire.. mavs vs memphis gonna be flames..
I doubt those 4 picks will mean anything significant as long as D Book is playing for Phoenix.
West is loaded 😳
Kevin’s finally gets a chance to win his first chip
Wait so what team does he play for all star game
Wait. KD is now going to go up AGAINST Kyrie in the West?
Proves kd isnt a superstar that can win by itself. He always seek the easy road out.
Brooklyn about to be the Cam Thomas Show
Charles barkely was right all the way, Please never ever never ever put KD with the same talk with LBJ . He is a joke compared to LBJ.  He was better joining the warriors again. LMFO "he just want to hoop". This man destroyed the brooklyn nets franchise. Such a snake! No surprise here
violent overpay.
😤 We'll all be missing Mikal and Cam in 2 years when CP3 retires with KD and Booker ALWAYS hurt on the bench 80% of the time...... Reminds me of getting rid of Stoudemire for old wash up Shaq. Funny Shaq and KD were both 34 when they got traded to the Suns. What a joke......
Suck it Joe Tsai
How did I wake up to this?
KD left the warriors because he didn't earn his rings there and now he joins another super team for people to say the same thing lmao
The nets are trash. They still got Joe Harris? He should have been traded long time ago. What's going on in the front office? Wow!!
We the KD fans will now venture out to the desert 🏜️
Nets didn’t get Ayton, Booker or Paul in the deal? LMAO!!!
Ben Simmons wanted to leave Philly and now he’s all alone lol
Is Ja Morant still not worried on the West?
East is dead again lol just Giannis and Embid/Harden and Boston lol ☠️
Brooklyn 😂
Must suck to be a owner of a team as far as purring a team together to WIN. You got these guys signing multi million dollar contracts for 3 years and in 6 months demand a trade. The Nets disaster is gonna go down in history as one of the most disappointing collection of talent to not even make it to a conference finals much less win a title.
The warriors are done finally
The Nets just keep on getting better. KD AND KRYIE NEVER SHOULD’VE CAME TO NYC. THEY TOO SOFT!!
Poor Brooklyn lol they gat f**k hard 🤣  is like a prostitut3 who gat ravaged and didn't get paid
What typa trade is that
Ben is by him self rn
The funny part is suns and Dallas both still won’t make it pass the 1st or 2nd round 😂
This is going to take a sacrifice from kd and dbook, I ant believe no one's talking about how their defence is about to plummett.. the main thing going for them is that dbook is in his prime, and kd may need to sacrifice scoring in order to get his teammates involved ...
Brooklyn nets Sean marks you can't send j crowder to the bucks you need a guard serge Ibaka hasn't played he seating at home waiting to be trade them three players play good together I just wait
SMH
Nets were a dumpster fire from jump
They need to put deandre ayton on the big 3 photo or at least add him or remove cp3 💯💯💯
I have a new team to use on 2k 🤣
Jay Z : At least we have Ben Simmons lol
Chris paul finally winning a chip
Lol he wanted to win a chip by his self. He can’t be lebron
Big mistake we traded our heart and soul for KD
ITS REALLY EMBARRASSING WHILE STEPH IS JUST RELAXING 🤣🤣🤣
I don't like the trade cam Johnson and Mikael bridges are young and just starting to break out playing great ..Durant will cry to be traded in a year or two...bad trade!!
Can honestly say at this moment the Warriors are finished. 😅 😂 😭
hmmm....
If bron did this, wow lol
Michael Jordan must curse the bulls after he left 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️why tf we don’t never get nobody
Lmaooo where does this leave Ben Simmons?
Crazy thing is, Nets will win the same amount of rings that the Suns will for the next 5 years.
The biggest winner of the Kyrie and KD trades = The Cleveland Cavaliers
All thing just to break Ja’s ego lol
This is the worst trade ever. You lose a great scorer and defensive minded bridges, a spot up clutch shooter in cam, crowder brought the intensity and swagger, for a snake that hasn’t played in god knows how long lol. Suns got scared when they saw that kyrie trade lol😂
The nets should play the Rabbi's 😂...that sensitive organization needs to be moved to Israel
Ja spoke too soon.
I'm sick of KD
Lacrybby is somewhere crying cause with KD to the Sun's n Kyrie Irving to the Mavs, Lakers ain't gonna make it to the finals😂😂
Guess we're back to the LEastern conference. The West has gotten very interesting all of a sudden
Suns logic : let’s get a bunch of stars past their expiration date and who come up short in the playoffs and throw them together
Hate it
All this to stop curry
Now Kyrie can't wait to go to the Lakers next season
I want see a healthy suns vs a healthy warriors playoff match-up no matter what round....and as fans somehow someway the lakers have to get into the playoffs through the play-in..
Nets just got there future back.
I feel like the sun's lost to much depth and defense with this trade
Suns in 4
whats happening right now is like my 2k career simulations 🤣
Mikal who?????😅
Who cares,KD is waaaaaayyyy overrated anyway. He's accomplished nothing without the GSW.
The real winner here is the Rockets that hold a ton of unprotected Brooklyn first round picks and pick swaps with Brooklyn
Uh oh 😳 😬 Phoenix looking mighty frightening
The Sun is rising.
We finally getting the Lebron vs kD matchup?????????? It’s been years!
The suns are making a big splash 👏🏽
Lol west won't be so open anymore
As a Lakers fan I went from happy that we got a little bit better to now worried lol
Man they ran away from Simmons lol
Brooklyn nets might be the worst franchise ever this and the billy king era are embarrassingly bad. Gotta feel for nets fans
Horrible trade for the suns. You needed bridges defense for this team to work. 4 picks and 2 good starters for a injured 34 yo who hasn’t won anything without curry is robbery
mortgaging the future for the now is almost always a massive failure.
Imagine lebron going to the heat and lakers and then leaving withoit delivering a championship. Media would destroy him
Suns traded their whole future for a dude who might dip lol
Durant is such a p*ssy bro. I just can’t OmG 😅.. And if you KD slobber Idc about your views on this clown he’s a lame.. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Well at least they still have Ben Simmons. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Breaking news Kevin demands a trade from Phoenix says his AC in the desert dont work. Breaking news Kyrie demands a trade from Dallas says his third eye is blind.
Ben Simmons the team killer 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I just got done saying about Kyrie last week - when the floodgates open everyone goes out the door...no way was Durant staying.  This was about as predictable an event as death and taxes.   Message to the Suns and Big D - just because you throw some stars together on a team doesn't automatically punch your championship ticket.   Just ask Westbrook when he joined the Lakers.    The Brooklyn experiment was nothing short of a compete disaster.   A championship team needs more than just a collection of big names.  I remember reading about the 70's Steelers - they had a chemistry, a bond, a true team mentality.  Some (maybe it's most) of these big shots today play as individuals.  It's all about themselves and nothing else.  Just goes to show some things don't change...it takes everybody to win a championship...everyone has to be on board as a team and a unit working together...it's not all about the stars.  How's that for a concept?  LOL.  The primadonnas rule this bizarre day and age of sports.  Can you imagine Jordan, Bird, and Magic playing on 3 or 4 different teams in their prime?  I'm just glad I got to see the true HOFers when I was young and growing up.  All these pampered primadonnas have to do is tell GM/ownership JUMP and the next words you hear are how high?  Personally, I'm looking forward to seeing how "patient" Ben Simmons is going to be in Brooklyn waiting on a rebuild.  No telling how long that will take and until it does the Nets could be downright awful.  Remember all the drama he created not long ago?  I'd be laughing out loud if I were a 76ers fan...not that Harden is any less a drama queen.  Bottom line:  sounds like poetic justice if you ask me.  This modern age is a joke.  It really is.   And a bad one at that.
good kd go go kd we love it ❤
Who's kd gonna play for in the Allstars game?
I said it when it happened and it has proven to be true.  The Nets declined the best offer from the Timberwolves during the off season.  The dumb teams are the ones who are desperate and make moves at the trade deadline.  Especially those who lose big stars.  Another horrible org.
I won't say the Nets will make the playoffs but they can definitely stay competitive. Might wanna see if Atkins would come back and coach
Harden, KD and Irving shouldn't be called the Big 3 cuz they all gone, sucks to be a nets fan, they should be called the 3 stooges
Suns were before the most hated team, now imagine what people will think
KD wild 😂😂😂
This is going to be the nets all over again. Suns gave up good good keys players that come off the bench to help. They not winning a chip
Wow. Phoenix +2200 on winning championship.   Phoenix just got exponentially better.
I'm from Brooklyn and this sucks!!!!!!!!!!! at least tickets will be cheap
PHX stupid for this trade.. 🤷🏿‍♂️ Too many picks and Good players.. For 1 aging Superstar..
This is all Ja Morant’s fault 😂 “I’m good in the west” ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT ?
We knew this coming it should happen in the beginning of the season
I still think the nets made a mistake by not giving kyrie what he wanted. He wanted L.A. the lakers were willing to give up 2 first.
Music low key lit
Honestly, nets got back to the initial plan. They don't have superstars but they got some players that with commitment and hard work it will be possible to compete and possibly to give similar result or even better.
Ring chaser
It’s about time for nets young players to shine ✨ like Claxton and etc.
Must be nice to fail so miserably and be rewarded by being traded to another team. Durant and Irving should have to give half their pay to charity.
Brilliant move by the Phoenix Sun's. Bravo. 👏 👏 👏
Idk if I’m more shocked over KD getting traded or the fact that all the nets have now is Ben Simmons
Wow the Nets destroyed their team just wow the owner was completely done
🤯🤯
Ben Simmons ruined his career
Ja should have kept his mouth shut. Now him and the grizzlies should be worried and afraid and very
West is stacked LeBron ain't winning sh!t anymore
I hope Bridges keeps his iron man status out there.. going to miss that guy but super glad we didn't give up paul ayton or booker
What was ja morant saying about the west?
Well after KD retires, despite his immense talent, will always be seen as a piggybacker- someone who couldn't win championship unless he was on a stacked superteam.
I can’t believe they traded durant . I have a feeling dirnant wasn’t out just as much as Kyrie but he wasn’t publicly vocal about it as Kyrie. That sucks for the nets the last 2 seasons they was doing good until a star player wanted out.
I hope Russ joins them off the bench for the minimum
This all started by kyrie being a crybaby.
Finally those meme banners can come true...  Nets banner will read... Atleast we had Durant, Irving n Harden  Y so serious 😈🃏🥃
Mikal and Cam Johnson were great consistent players. Their future potential is unlimited. I wish they weren't traded...
So now Celtics only 1 problem in the west team which is Bucks.
Nets are cleaning 🧹 house.
Celtics really ended their fake dynasty in a sweep lmfao
KD wanting to be that second star again rather than a leader. Easy championships when you can't be double teamed and have all stars around you. Not getting my respect, but it's smart ofc.
I will be actively rooting against the Mavs and the Suns for the rest of Kyrie’s and KD’s career as long as they are on those teams. Fvck em.
KD sure loves his super teams.
Suns gave away pretty much nothing for kd. Those picks will be late picks and bridges barley averaged 17 ppg
M.bridges tweets OMG LOL. bro do you know you went to the NETS why you laughing haha
Phoenix suns could be favorites  to be NBA champions
Just when you tought the Suns couldn't get more annoying
Soo the Nets didn't want Cp3 and Durant on the Nets but they'll send him to Phoenix?? I'm BEYOND CONFUSED
They just put my career on on 2k n let that bih play 🤯 the nba so crazy now
THE NETS ARE GOING TO BE GOOD, WITH ALL THOSE GREAT ROLE PLAYERS AND BEN SIMMONS,  I THINK IMMA NETS FAN NOW.
Nba script writers suck.
Terrible trade.
Y’all talking about Kyrie In Dallas but D book and Kd bout to dominate 🫢
this is good for durant cause he cant be the main man (bus driver) on a team and win. basically its gonna be like in golden state again. suns now have enough fire power to push them over the top.
KD: I'm gonna leave to form my own super team because I cannot win without a super team Also KD: Where's Kyrie? I NEED TO JOIN ANOTHER SUPER TEAM
Love this Deal let's go suns 🏆
Bad move for them Johnson and Mikal huge for that team
Let’s not forget that Brooklyn is now Ben Simmons’ team. 🤦🏾‍♂️
Here comes the Sun's!!!!
Ben Simmons is on the spot now
KD to the sun changes the nba scene now if they gel they will be the team to beat in the west probably the whole nba
How rigged is this sport. All that for a aged star with injury issues.
I like the Sun's chances.
Would you rather have KD & Booker or Kyrie & Luka!?!
Suns = NBA Champs
Rockets holding all those first rounders from the Harden trade probably celebrated as much as the Suns.
I understand bridges needed to be traded for this to happen but keeping Cam would’ve been a way better deal
Man I'm not giving 4 first for any one player.
Breaking news Kevin Durant is overrated! And is n always will be that!
What saddens me is that the Nets decided to rebuild. Getting rid of Irving and Durant means no championship. Say what you want to say but KD is arguably the best player in the nba and Kyrie was balling.
okay i'm officially a Suns now ;-)
Lol all the KD and Kyrie fans won’t be watching the nets anymore… they’ll be going back to the knicks b*tch until they become relevant again.
Ja is shaking in his boots rn
That's a great haul for the nets.
Give Steven his respect, he said before anyone else.
Anyone wants Ben Simmons for free. I will throw in an additional $20.00 cash.🤣
Ben Simmons mad asf rn
They got some haul for KD, an injury prone 34/35 year old .. yea he’s great but it’s only a 2 year window I’m gonna say
Durant just happy to be out of the cold I swear we tired of winter
Man why couldn’t they trade Ayton and keep Mikal 🤦🏾…
New York City basketball is cursed
What a sad to be a Nets fan. I couldn't care less about Kyrie, but KD'S departure hurts 🤕🤢☹️I'm gonna have me 10 shots of tequilas right now🤣
Congrats to the suns on winning the championship. What a cheap trade
The Nets are one of the biggest superteam busts of all time.
First Nash, then Kyrie, now Durant. Brooklyn falling apart just like they did on how they handled c-o-v-i-d. What a joke....
OMG NETS POVERTY AF
Durant has played with the best 4 point guards of his era. That’s wild
And just like that another Big 3 experiment implodes for Brooklyn.😮😂
Bruh the Nets really traded away Kyrie and KD for some role players and picks 💀 Didn’t even push for Deandre Ayton.
“Scary hours” 😂
Kudos to Joe Tsai basically handing KD a team to win because he didn't want him to lose again, knowing how great KD
That package is suspect AF !!!!
Bad move Mikal and Johnson were key parts of the suns roster 👎👎
How is woj so aware of everything ?
Phoenix remembers how Luka embarrassed Booker last year in the playoffs.
kd doesn't not worth this much. suns gg
Saying the Nets won’t be able to contend in the East with that deep bench is foolish … East is very top heavy
Back in the West.
And they have the nerve 😤 to say LeBron plays with stack line ups ninja, please...
Nets traded their 2 super stars to other teams for nothing but the lakers would have to give up the bank
The nets needed to rebuild good for them they the owners, GM learned there lesson like Steven A said
KD stay with a deck higher than giraffe neck
They took a massive L
There’s nothing enormous about 4 first round picks that are all going to be on the 20s 🤷🏻‍♂️
Those picks Houston got from the nets in the Harden trade are going to be amazing.
Well at least they still have Ben Simmons!
This has to be CP3's best and maybe last shot at a championship.  He'll be 38 next year and KD will be 35.
Wasted 4 years of franchise time 😂
Not worth it man !!!  Should have done anything to keep Bridges 🏜️. I bet Durant will get injured early.
Two of the biggest cry babies
Give James Jones a huge amount of credit and money for this trade.
Beautiful, after qhat that owner did to kyrie, he deserves this, they work for hou but dont forget what they bring to the organization
I don’t have a vested interest in any of these teams that have made trades, but these trades have made me super excited for the NBA playoffs. This is going to be fun! What if Dallas and Phoenix meet in the playoffs? What if KD elbows Kyrie in his sternum?
The Merc Durant strikes yet again. Dude can't build a core on his own. Dude can't win without 2-3 HoFs.   Watch him try and go to Cleveland in a year or two.
They fire phoenix suns legend Steve nash and then ends up going there.
Hands down the craziest NBA season I’ve ever personally seen.
CP3 is gonna finally get his title.
Devon Booker will have the most open shots now
Nets game tickets starts at $1.99.
The thing is y’all are forgetting that they attempted to trade Paul for Kyrie. So while we can say they should win a ring we don’t know how that will play out.
I can see how certain sections of the media *cough* Skip Bayliss *cough* are going to play this into Kevin Durant demonstrating that he needs to have great players surrounding him otherwise he has no shot at winning a title.  Durant is ditching NJ to go to a much better situation, with a far superior roster to try and win a title without the Warriors.  Durant is a great scorer, adequate defender now, and can be the focal point of your offence.  But, he's not a locker room leader, he's not a strong personality who's going to dominate a team culture, and he's not going to make the players around him better.  Surround him with good players, and he'll make you a title contender, but he's never going to make a team into a championship team by elevating his team mates.  This pretty much puts the limit on KD's status as an all-time great.  One of the greatest scorers in NBA history, but then so were Carmelo Anthony and Bernard King and George Gervin all considered the same thing during their prime and no one considers any of them all-time greats.  We get captured by KD's skills and the ease with which he scores, but on teams where he needs to step up, be a leader and elevate his team into a winning one, he's not that guy.
The Nets are in a better position than when they started this season. Kudos to Sean Marx.
I feel sad watanabe brooklyn starting to gel with thier new coach 13w streak and then kd injured
KD, CP3 & D. Book? Aw yeah they going to the Finals
Should have gone to the lakers
I thought this was a troll at first 😭😭
I cant believe I woke up to THIS!!!
I have tickets to see the Nets play the Celtics in Boston next month, I don't even want to go now.
Happy for Nets owner Joe Tsai to be rid of the BIG THREE CON ARTISTS  kd, kyrie and harden who played only 16 games together -
At this point they should just completely ignore the Easter Conference and Crown the NBA champions whoever comes out from the West.
I think everyone who was raving about this nets team should line up to get slapped
They left the nets as the 4th seed and said aight I’m out
Nets organization: Now that we don't have Kyrie or Durant we are officially ready to move into the basement standings. But we promise before the sun goes supernova we will win a championship.............maybe? (Crying)
Warriors we gotta get somebody please get Giannis or something KD to the suns is very scary
KD is never gonna be happy on any team... so sensitive... but literally one of the greatest players of all time... just weird.
I can’t believe half these comments are about Ja Morant. You people need therapy to get over this obsession.
clippers fumbled not getting kyrie now suns if healthy win this year
Upcoming news: Nets trade Ben Simmons to the Shanghai Sharks.
The Dallas/Phoenix series should be interfering. Owner GM and Nash destroyed the nets. Has kyrie didn’t let him play 🙄 away games for long time. Didn’t use Griffin or Drummond. Glad KD and Kyrie got out of that mess franchise!
Knicks eyeing that 5th spot to play Cleveland ❤
Oh man. Sun's might be scary. New title favorites?
The in this whole deal is Prokhorov whom  has avoided sanctions and is living in the beach on Rothschild BLVD in Tel Aviv. The money he made from this deal is crazy.
Well this shakes up everything. I honestly didn't think the Nets were going to trade KD by the trade deadline. They even came out and said they had no intentions of trading him. Shocked.
Yo people were saying imagine they trade KD to the Suns yesterday, and I can't believe it turned out to be true. The Steph Curries and Damian Lillards of our time are now considered to be gems. Zero loyalty from either the team or player nowadays. Pure business and selfish moves from both ends.
I wanted him in Portland so bad. Like what’s wrong with dame. He’s as quite as dame both can 50 any night. And Portland a quiet place and he dnt got to lead
Kyrie asks for trade is a narcissist kd asks for trade it’s a great deal for both teams and owners smh I hate these white men
I wish the Hornets would get a knew owner. Maybe we can actually assemble a good team for once.🤦🏽‍♀️
I guess its Ben Simmons' team now, its time for him to step up.
Brawdis is happy
No super star will ever go to the nets lol unless they create one
Suns gave up their depth 😂😂😂
THE NBA IS A  SOAP OPERA
Sucks the suns had to trade Mikal
This is madness
If this is true KD never learns & it seems that he's is NOT a leader or INDEPENDENT thinker.-he allows Kyrie to lure him away from the Warriors and as soon as Kyrie leaves he also wants to leave.
This is the worst. Suns fans don't deserve this with their trash azz attitudes. Hope it explodes. KD can't do it alone it seems. Crazy
Please Lord we just want 1 chip. Fan since 93
Nobody wants to play with ben!
Nets are the deepest team in the NBA; just no all stars
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!
Warriors run done
I think Bridges is underated the Suns will miss what he brings more than they realize.
What did Kevin Durant cost the Suns? Everything...
Brooklyn's restarting again 🤦🏿‍♂️
This is ridiculous. The Suns did not need KD at all. Such cowards to form a super team like this and get the automatic ring. Meaningless championship like when KD went to the Warriors.
What in the actual F did I wake up to? What?!!!
The Suns with KD aint gonna work, imagine cp3, booker, kd and da's not a good defenders... Bucks gonna demolish this team
Nets is ben simmons team now
Pure insanity. The Superbowl in a couple days and it's like an after thought. I h8 to compare this to Kobe and Gigi tragedy, but the Superbowl is like the last thing everybody's thinking or talking about right now.
Oh boy. The Sun's got played! All that talent left the building AND FOUR first round picks. Sheesh. They're screwed for generations to come.
I’m actually glad KD getting outta Brooklyn.
Which 3 and D wings could Phoenix add now? They lost all they had
Nets are a L organization
Crazy how a team can be dismantled so quickly. League is brutal.
The rich get richer
What the wha???
Happy for KD! Let’s go Suns
Simmons Thomas Bridges Johnson Claxton , not too shabby .
So disappointing. First KD joined a 73-9 team and now he joins Chris Paul, Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns. The two in Golden State will never count. That never happened and should be completely erased from history. Now KD is joining a team that already made it to the NBA finals just two years ago. KD is not the driving force, and he is a bus rider once again.  Lebron was not the man in Miami until his final year in Miami when Wade and Allen were at their tale end. Jordan won as the man. Kobe won as the man. Giannis won as the man. They won it the hard way. KD will never be the man. I’m so sick of these super teams. This should not be happening and KD should be ordered to go somewhere else where it is not stacked. KD is not the man in Phoenix. He is doing the same thing again.   I’M DONE WATCHING NBA and PHOENIX SUNS! I’M NOT WATCHING IT ANYMORE!!
YOOOO that’s not something I ever expected KD to the nets that’s CRAZYYYY and kyrie to the mavs ? I didn’t expect that either
Don’t be surprised when you see the nets on the top of the mountain in a year or two with all those draft picks
KD was probably like, I'm not staying here with these noobs.
Hawks need to trade Collins to nets for Ben then move him to PF
So, they did mention James Jones part in making this trade happen.
All these superstars change teams once they can’t win lmao.
Ok…I guess now we can stop mocking james harden, he knew it all along.
How did they hold on to Deandre Ayton?   They don’t even mention him … this is a Big Four
Suns are gonna Implode.  Durant & Kyrie Too Toxic.  Worse 2 NBA STARS since the 1970's
Finally… CP3 …. Gonna get a ring…. Slime reaper….Booker & CP3 …. It gonna be a epic
so the owner of brooklyn just show true pettiness,... he traded Durant to where he wants and kyrie to where he doesn't, ... congratulation in loosing billions in the next few years. traded Durant for peanut
Well, it is official. The Nets experiment is and has been a total failure. I can't think of too many superteams that had immediate championship aspirations, just to be a borderline playoff team/lottery team four years later with nothing to show for it. At least Miami won two titles. 😂😂
Thank you, Mikal. For that highly scrappy defense you played, for your aggressive offense, and for your infectious smile.
Fascinating! I just can't figure out how often new videos appear?
Suns lose this trade hard lol. Maybe compete for 1 championship max but their future is dead
Just a reminder they could’ve had jaylen brown if they traded KD when he asked instead of joe Thai being petty
They really don't want Lebron to win nothing.
This dude has the most perfectly flat head i hade ever seen lol
Win for NETS
The suns missed their time to shine. Sorry KD it’s too late.
With Chris Paul’s luck you gotta show me lol
Suns Mavs Nuggets Grizzlies battle
The twins get to stay together.
Yeeeeeeeeee!!!!!! LFG
Ben Simons has left the NBA
KD is like a woman that can't keep a man 😂
Im sure Ja is not fine in the west now
Lessons in this whole Nets story, don’t let players run your team.
The Suns are GONNA be a PROBLEM
I'm so glad he left that bad a$$ franchise
Hope the suns lose
Suns still suck
4 first round picks for an aging KD.... If this lineup doesn't win a chip now, suns will be tanking for the next 10 years.
Very bad trade by the Nets once again, they traded their super star Kyrie for less talent then they traded their mega star Durant for 3 players no where near the talent of Kevin Durant, that was a steal by the Suns the Nets should have force them to give up Ayton because Claxton needs help in the middle , u never give up your super star for less talent, the Suns really got over on this one they didn't have to give up no key players, SMH
Mikal bridges sick right now
Breaking News!!! Ben Simmons Has Been Traded For A 6-Inch Subway Sub And A Diet Coke...
Thank you lord. God is good can I get a amen?
YESSS, THANK YOU 😊
The NBA has definitely peeked my interest again.
The east is ummm pretty weak now … Boston, Bucks or Sixers to the finals now …
Kyrie Irving will be joining them next season watch! I knew thus was gonna happen!
But the real question is, how will this effect Lebron’s legacy?
Remember when the nets could have got jaylen brown for KD? Lmao😂
The boston offer was a COMPLETE JOKE compared to the Phoenix Offer All them First Round Picks😳😳
Bucks need to go get bucks need to go get crowder or bridges
So the Nets traded their super stars for beach players and non lottery picks.
It's Steve Nash's fault.....
this is crazy. nobody is beating them 4 out of 7 times
How they got away with this Heist!?! They didn't have to give away anything premier!!! 🙃
Another weak move for Durant!
Still bucks in 6.. suns sold the entire farm and still will never get the ring
Dang tHey still put gafford “HigHligHt” in tHe reel🫠🤣 dude get no love out Here
Man I wish Phoenix could've kept Cam Johnson
By far the best team in the NBA. My goodness. Go Suns 🔥
the suns are wining ring
I'll never respect this era.
how people respect kyrie and KD is absolutely crazy to me
How do the nets not have 15 first round picks after trading harden and kd lol
Up to all of you those are  your choice now i don't care even though you trade to the moon
Suns lost in that deal
I thought this was fake news for a min
It's so crazy how at the beginning of the season, the Nets were the favorite to win the east. Now they are even behind my Miami Heat for 5th .... From 1st to 10th 😂 So ridiculous (Nets)
Cris Paul  Booker  Kd  Ayton  Dam they the favorites now in the west if cp3 and booker can stay healthy
The question is now is  Why was everyone so ready to leave the nets? What’s going on over there?
Cam Thomas must be thrilled, now they’re in full rebuild mode and now they can rebuild around him. This is his team now. The Suns needs KD the west is better than ever now.
KD has Russell Westbrook his career.
Nets why y'all didn't get the big man suns might take it this year
People forgetting Chris Paul is still on the team. Suns ain’t winning a chip lol
Kwahi definitely not playing this year
tsk crazy week.
Yea but come playoffs will the suns even be healthy...
the rudy gobert trade traded more players and assets than what the suns traded for KD
Ben Simmons on ya team , I’d be ready to slide to.
I feel bad for Brooklyn fans. Fr fr. Kd and Kyrie said they didn't need a coach. Played like it. Got the coach fired. Had Brooklyn trade away significant pieces. Got swept in the playoffs and then demanded trades after THEY essentially ran the team. Now Brooklyn is in shambles. Wow. They got nothing from those 2 being there at all.
brooklyn nets just lots 95% of its value .... sean marks is a dum dum. should of paid kyrie. i don't even think the NBA owners realize their fans like players, not teams ..... this is a different sport, not a real team sport, but a super star sport. this sport is run by supuer stars, fans follow PLAYERS ... teams are just what ever. you think lebron fans cares what team he plays for????
But how will this affect Lebron’s legacy?
Overpay lmao
Just like that the West is so tough now more
The Brooklyn nets owner is the true definition of just because you’re a billionaire it doesn’t make you smart 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 . The man couldn’t even make it with three hall of fame players 🤦🏽 Jordan didn’t like Jerry Krause but he was GM of the century. The nets front office is 🗑️
Joe Tsai is a CCP boot licker 🇨🇳🇨🇳🚮🚮🚮🚮🚮
KD been wanted out before Kyrie
Suns lost this deal long term
NBA I’m out ….too much instability for me as a fan!
Nets look better without kd and kyrie
So glad for KD. F uck the Brokelyn Nets and their sihtty communist owner. Wish them all the worst 🖕🏾
Suns vs clippers in WCF
Win-win for both teams. The Nets can rebuild now, and they have a bright future. KD makes the Suns instant contenders. I'd be worried if I'm the Nuggets.
Nets Lose KD,Harden and Irving for NBA 1st Defensive Team.
Ya'll can have this NBA!!
Kyrie @Dallas, Now KD @Pheonix. Ja still "ok"?
Nets fans in tears rn ☠️
Who's left at the Nets????
Nets the new okc 😭
Now the west is op again
Wow
I’m happy for CP3
As a active suns hater I’m sick to my stomach 😔
It’s so sad that back in 2018 the Nets were such a fun team and superstar away from competing… SMH.
This could age poorly but I’d be willing to bed this ends bad for the suns… 4 picks is wild
What is  🏀  ?  Is that the sport where they are not allowed to play defense and that hasn’t evolved since it’s inception except for the 3 point shot ?  What’s a Kyrie & Durant ?  Spoiled fkboi’s ! 😂😂😂
Hopefully Durant will be back wearing #35 since Kevin Johnson's #7 jersey is retired and off limits.
What a week for the nba. All this right before the super bowl too!! Man, I’m excited to see what happens next.
Laker fans back to depression 😂
YO THIS IS BEN SIMMONS TEAM NOW 🤣😂🤣
Thus man bounces around from team to team, more than my ex.  Jesus
Yet again, that’s Chris Paul’s team.  KD good as long as he’s not driving the bus.
With the overall team quality Durant has had it’s crazy he doesn’t have more rings. Dude just refuses to not play on a super team.
Mannn The Suns really gave up some guys I enjoyed playing on their team. Of course, gaining KD is great but Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson are dynamic and fun to watch. Jae Crowder is also a vet that can be a very useful piece on a team.
Chris Paul about to get his 1st 💍 now! We bout to 👀 more State Farm Commercials. 😁
Now that kd gone, I can root for Brooklyn again 😁
This has been a wild season.
The west is LOADED!!!!
There is no reset button to hit Joe needs to sell the team after the way he treated Kyrie. No one will want to play for him now. Brooklyn is undesirable to most players now.
the nets should build around simmons with shooters he could be a mini Giannis
KD and Kyrie are 2 dumb brothers. They were playing some of their best basketball before KD went down (and Thomas is really emerging). It looked as though they were finally heading towards a championship. Now that both men are with 2 different teams, at best only one can win a championship....not both.
KD Won Another Ring 💍 Cup Cake That 😂😂😂
can't wait for secret base collapse video about the Brooklyn Nets. what a complete failure.
I guess they said they’ll try to score 150 a game cause they’re not stopping anything. Not even a cold lol
Looks like kd can't win on his own now with the suns being a super team
Does anyone feel that the suns defense took a big hit with this deal
The nets will never get a star under this regime
If CP3 can't win a chip with KD i dont know what else he needs
Middy Magicians
THE LORD WILL NOT HOLD YOU GUILTLESS FOR TAKING HIS NAME IN VAIN
The west is stacked again
And they managed to keep Aston. This group is tough. No depth but tough 😂
Man the suns get to keep ayton
Somewhere Steve Nash just watching and laughing at the Nets right now
Nets big 3 is bye bye bye blame the nets owner.. He is the worst no championship Brooklyn SORRY!!
Don't b surprise if kyrie goes to the suns this off season ,, low key moves ,, I c it 💯
Nba baby heating up 2k23 let's gooo
Ben Simmons might have to shoot.
The shift on the west is now Ja Morant fault. He started the no problem on the west lol
What's this if the suns are healthy they got the best starting 5. For nets ticket holders you should be able to demand compensation.
Kevin Durant must have the best agent ever to get his way twice while injured. And for 7 guys this time.
Not even a Suns fan but I can't lie the new owner came in making big waves, and I'm here for it
But Kobe couldn't get CP3 GTFOH
I think Lebron is going back to the east…he’s not getting any chips in the west..maybe coming back to Cleveland and Donovan ..Miami with butler as a rider maybe he can go back to playoff😂…only bucks and Celtics is on his way..
THE LORD WILL NOT HOLD YOU GUILTLESS FOR TAKING HIS NAME IN VAIN!
Suns get KD and all of a sudden everyone forgets what kind of choke jobs Booker and CP3 are capable of
KD is such a joke. Searching for super teams from Gsw to Nets with Kyrie, Harden and now this! 🙈
Lmao now Brooklyn is left with Ben Simmons after all of this
The Sun’s may just have cemented their championship rings.  I simply cannot see any other team that can beat them with this lineup…the only ones that can stop them is themselves.
MIAMI HEAT is the best team for KEVIN DURANT
This tough
It was Brooklyn all of long. Shout out to Kyrie 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Suns takin it all this year!
KD is just a living, walking example of an abusive relationship. A first ballot hall of famer that turned himself into Kyrie's punching bag; kept twisting himself into Kyrie-shaped knots.
Woj is annoying me lifting his body while he’s talking 😁
Good! Now my Nets are free from the drama.
the West really like one of Drakes old albums..... Nothing was the same
I'm glad the Knicks never get Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.
But yet, y'all Talk so much sh*t LeBron...😂
2 things that Sean Marks would do over if he could go back - hire different coach instead of nash - rethink how to handle the COVID vaccine mandate - one was within his control, one wasn't - not much more you could do outside of that
Brokelyn netz is real🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lowkey the nets got a good young team dinwidee claxton cam Thomas Simmons bridges and cam Johnson
Sun going to win 🏆
The GMs and owners from other organizations really work hard to make each other better when it comes to the departure of elite superstars.  It's now between  Warriors, phoneix, Denver, and Dallas to come out of the West.  No other team in the West can compete against these 4 teams in a 7 game series until these  4 teams play each other at some point to advance to the Conf finals and Then on to the championship for the chip against either Milwaukee or Boston from the East.   The NBA just got more exciting for this year's playoffs! Wow 👌
KD has surpassed expectations FACT
Lol espn ain’t sleeping
I called it when the Nets scrapped the DLO, Allen, Dinwiddie team. They were going to regret it. And they did for a bit but they may have won this trade (they can rebuild now), too early to tell. The suns are very top heavy but I am not sure of their bench. I am curious to see how this plays out.
The West just got a whole lot more interesting
“I ain’t worried about the west” - Ja Morant
Simmons: guys?
This is so wack!
They finally got Booker sum help👏👏
Don’t want him. We lost our young core and first round picks for an injury prone drama queen. He’ll only play 40 games a year. Keep Durant in the East. We have the choice to be great for the next decade or be good for a year or two. The new owner is an idiot.
The Nets got another W. Spencer Dinwiddie Mikal Bridges Dorian Finley Cam Johnson Jay Crowder Cam Thomas Nic Claxton Royce Ben Simmons and draft picks. KD and KI phuck em🤷‍♂️
This is change everything
Lebron demanding a trade out the west this morning 🤣🤣🤣
Some people saying suns lost crowder? Omg do you even watch games?
THIS IS SO SO SO SO SO DUMB..... BRIDGES IS TURNING INTO A YOUNG DURANT... DURANT IS OLD AND BREAKING DOWN.... IM SICK TODAY AS A SUNS FANS ... SICK
What's the use of trading? Hand the trophy to Phoenix already.
Now can we all say that kd can't do it with his own team he is not an leader
Boy I know Charles Barkley jumping up and down right about now oh wait ain’t he injured???
Wow..
Squad
05:19 the people laughing in the background 😂
Happy for KD and Sun's fans, but I hate it for Joker cause I felt like they were gonna get outta the west this year. Memphis has gone raggedy as of late, Steph just got hurt again, and the West is the weakest it's been for probably 20 years. But this move makes Phoenix the favorites for my money.
Dam the assists Chris Paul will get no only from Booker now but feeding KD as well wow
So Brooklyn essentialy chose Mikael Bridges over a chance at Wenbanyama... Instead of trading KD and Kyrie in the summer and tanking the season for a chance at possibly the most hyped no1 pick of all time, their GM chose to keep them for half the season, get up in the standings and then, when they have no chance at the no1 pick, trade them both for what he could have gotten for them in the summer. What a GENIUS.
Lebens championship aspirations are truly over now…fakers haven’t beat the suns let alone made the playoffs/play in in years it’s a wrap 😂😂
Good move Brooklyn. Get rid of the headaches, reset and try again.
Ja you still not worried about anybody in the West?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
cupcake strikes again
THE WILD WILD WEST ⚒️
Nets will be a tough team to beat. Defensively they will be fire with Crowder + Bridges.
Ben Simmons is officially the last man standing.
I hate the nba 😢
Four first rounders!!!? In addition to Bridges and Crowder. They BETTER win a championship. Because their future is going to SUCK.
suns winning the championship
CP still waiting on his playoff injury to disappear in the 2nd round
Anyyyyywhere but the Suns ffs KD.
The Nets are finished! ESPN, hold this L.
Woj is so messed up over all this news he called Scott, Kevin lol
😂😂😂 Ja-Moron and LeGM gotta be so depressed right now 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Well I guess we will see how the suns will fair with Durant. Ayton Paul and Booker
This team is going to be a real problem, and ya don't wanna admit it
Bridges gonna shine on the Nets. Sun lost defense.
Noone wants to play with Simmons lol. Nets GM gonna get fired for sure. Brooklyn crowds gonna be 1/4 capacity
Lukas shook
Its crazy how the nets went from kd, kyrie, and harden i thought they were gonna win a chip
Ben Simmons is all by himself poor guy. I bet my 2 legs and future walking abilities that he will still NOT avg more than 10 pts a game
Hahahaha net
Good get rid of the 2 headaches
NBA Finals... 🔐
Celtics must be happy like a f****t n jail. A sure cake walk to the finals for them
Look out KD Deandre Ayton Booker Paul another super team
“Scary Hours”….. oh well
The nets are trash now
Then Kd is going to want to leave the suns. This is annoying these guys are nothing but screw ups and disappointments.
Nets some bozos I can’t lie but I called y’all the worst franchise to handle superstars KD still gonna be frustrated in phoenix they not going anywhere even with booker.
MC Gusto an the CB4 CREW  (MEMPHIS  GRIZZLIES)  better whatch there back the real Gusto is out..
Cam Thomas will be special
Congrats Phoenix fans
wow that was fast
Its fair to say The WEST is better yet again than EAST after this ... But the Suns just lost their DEF ..
KD always finds a way to land on a super team because he knows he cant carry the load alone smh…
Knicks Dodge a bullet. This just turned out to be an epic failure for the Nets.   KD me be the man but not in New York.
I woke up to some more NBA drama and I love it 😂
Terrible terrible trade. Literally our whole future was just taken away from us for f-ing Kevin Durant.
How would this have worked under old all star format? Would durant and ky still start for east?
Seems like the problem is the Nets inside culture.
Brooklyn is right where they should be now.. Nowhere.
Nets are in the mud 😂😂😂
KD, Kyrie, Tai Chi, Nuggets in the finals in 4.
Why do they even sign contracts anymore ?
The Nets are not interested in winning the championship 😀
Good , the Nets are a poor organization
cp3 was beggin like curry nem i need ah ring before i retire kd please 😂
4th seed team trades its best players. Ok league looks very rigged
Not all NBA rings are worth the same. There are real rings where you play your whole pro career for the same team and win the championship without a super team, like Dirk Nowitzki did, and then there are more fake rings where the bus driver joins a team that is already championship team, or a team that has been in the NBA Finals in the last 2 years
How they kept ayton or booker is insane nets should be looked into for mal practice
Durant now piggy backing off Booker... might as well have stayed at Golden State.
I am interested to see what a Dinwiddie, Thomas, Bridges, Johnson, Claxton starting 5 can do.  Four guys shooting 40% or better from three this year.
The NBA owners are gonna come down hard on the players during the next collective bargaining negotiations. Especially when it comes to players honoring their contracts and showing up to work.
They should trade Simmons to Lakers
veto this trade
Ben simmons took the biggest L in NBA history
Nobody wants to play in NYC, crazy taxes, high pressure fan base, toxic front office culture
Here KD go to another built team 😂
I wonder why the media never highlights the bad front office decisions by Brooklyn. They hired an unqualified coach and possibly GM. They have a petty owner who disciplines grown men like a High School principal. It always seems like the players are responsible for the breakup.
As a LeBron fan I can honestly say we can just let this season go the West is back wild again 😢😩
This year has been insane!!!
Way too much to give up... 4 first round picks...
Nba really is a joke
Espn is cringe
Durant a ring chaser period
4 first round picks plus three players🤦‍♂️
Suns winning a ring 🔥🔥🔥
At least they still have ben Simmons to build around 🤣🤣
The lakers better wake tf up we need this for the history of nba just make the playoffs than the warriors timber wolves we need that
This is the most competitive Western conference ever
Kd a loser . Dude can't get a chip on his own team . Dude has to team up with book and cp3 lmao
Knock knock: Ja- Who is it?       Karmaaaaa
Mets is trash and they are not Brooklyn
Ja: I'm  still no worr...I'm .. I'm  fine in the west ..
The nets owner is racist
These have been the wildest trades in  the past few seasons
Championship
Man, thought this was some sort of Aprils fools when I saw it pop up in my feed. Wow, just wow. East is really now a 3 horse race.
The owner is racist
Go Cavs
Ben simmons is the highest paid player on the Nets and the biggest name on the team wow
Nets just wanted to get rid of these guys...they didnt ask for much
Seems like the Nets made out with all those picks.
Bruh Benjamin Simmons feeling real lonely right now ! 😂
the nets front office gotta be the worst in nba history for trading away kd harden and kyrie in one year
The days of superstars playing for one franchise is long gone. There's no more Dirk Nowitzki, Tim Duncan and Kobe.
Ayoooooo😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ja Morant and Memphis are getting eliminated in the second round. 😅
Nets don’t have a superstar but they lowkey got a good squad tho
Warriors need to make a move for Lebron.
The Phoenix Suns almost did it 2yrs ago. Let’s see if they do it Kevin Durant
Western conference to Ja Morant: f around and find out 😂😂😂
Best deadline in history.
Brooklyn by far the worst organization in the woke state it must feel good to go in the south
Nice
Ben Simmons looking around like, where'd everybody go?
Pray for the nets fans
I hate how the players have so much power in the league now it’s so wack they can sit out games if they want an they can request trades mid season or after a bad game an just go which is not good. What about the fans? I’m slowly but surely falling back from the NBA
Should make for interesting Western Conference playoffs
Ben Simmons won’t touch the court ever again, mark my words 😂
KD is nothing but a ring chaser, he’s s lethal shooter and scorer but just don’t have what it takes to be a leader
Bridges was Phoenix's engine, he will be missed there. 😢
Cp3, Booker, and KD? life now 2k
yea ben Simmons is gone
Everybody in the whole world know that kd gonna cost a lot but as a suns fans losing mikal is really gonna break my heart  Mikal is young and active player  He never get tired, never miss a game , never get injured  He has a really good chemistry with cp,book and da  Will miss him I mean it 😢 😭😭
Mikal, cam thomas, ben , cam johnson and claxton is not bad for a rebuilding team. Young assets and a lot of picks in the future.
It's amazing how not a single superstar will even look at the Miami heat. The things Miami does with the little talent they have is like no other. Instead of bouncing around to different teams all they had to do was go to Miami and stay there and a legacy would have been built
Basically the east is trash again
Brooklyn nets going to crumble no superstar going want to play there after this
Get Ben Simmons some shooters unleash him on the league
Just became a suns fan
Cam Thomas about to average 40 for the rest of the season now.
Nets are the biggest failure in nba history
The Nets organization got completely screwed. They will never give a player that much leverage ever again. That’s tuff!
Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges  are given Room to come into the starlight! I hope they return to phoenix again.  I'll root for them, make the Nets your Team.
I thought it would be a a walk in the park for the Mavs with the Kyrie Irving trade, boy how things turned out so fast
ISO gang truly is no more.
KD repeats history. Joins the team with last year's best NBA record that failed to win a ring. Sound familiar?
I would leave too if Ben Simmons was my teammates and one of the highest paid on the team
I bet decent $$$ on Timberwolves to win championship this June. Wish me good luck 🎉 🎉🎉
Bridges and Cam will be missed
Wow,  Suns , Mavs, and Lakers are better now
Wow. Cp3 get his ring
Ben Simmons right now >>> 😵‍💫
Kd wont get rings now cuz of cp3
Yoooo. you guys and the indie circuit were ridin that Lakers trade hard lol. Phoenix was like hold my beer lololol. Can you imagine the collective groan in Lakerland after they were high-fiving about getting D-Lo back, and they got a message that said "KD to PHX" ahahahaha.
if this trio is healthy and they never win the chip. the biggest failure choke job 3 choker combined biggest failure in nba history and no excuses will ever cover up for their image.
Keep on moving that ball up the mountain, Brooklyn. I'm sure this won't blow up in your faces. 🤣
The Brooklyn Nets needs an enema! LoL SMDH 🤣
Sun's roster now misses as much time as AD on the reg. Js
I really like this. They gonna win the chip
This hurts I hate the Sun's hate cp3 hate booker biggest loud mouths in the game who have done nothing now they might have a shot actually makes me sad. Hopefully the usual happens cp3 goes down and kd does too I want cp3 to retire ringless.
The nets are such a trash organization 😂
KD/AYTON. vs. LeBron James/AD.  🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Nets will trade Ben Simmons before the trade deadline.
Nets really f*cked up ever since that boston trade years ago.They should also consider shuffling their front office.
LBJ wont be getting a ring this year aswell.thanks god
NETS gave up this season. They just wanna move on and rebuild.
All I know is 2K23 bout to be lit 🔥
kinda funny that kyrie and durant were both on one team now they’re on opposite sides of a rivalry
You'll welcome to the mid-range show!
this better work out for the suns otherwise they’ve destroyed their future
Warriors should get Mikal bridge for some defense
I want Luka and Kyrie to win a ring, if not them then KD, if not him then Giannis.
Woah 🤯
I don't  like it,gave up too much for him.
Not going to work for Phoenix!!!!
west is super stacked again lol
The NBA is like watching the most spoiled kids on your block get the best Christmas presents every week
Everyone going West now? What happened to the weak East?🤔🍻🍺
KD bring a chip to Phx I wonder how Chuck gonna feel lol
Notice how they didn’t make a big deal of Durant wanting a trade but with kyrie they destroyed him
So I’m assuming Ayton is gonna demand a trade in the off-season. And I’m assuming Brooklyn is gonna build around Cam and Claxton
Ok
The Western Conference just became a juggernaut!
As it has been said, he looks more like Kevin Du-can't, then Kevin Durant.
joined the 73 wins warrior and now he just joined the sun that already got big 3 what a hardest road he had =)) once a snake always be a snake
Cam Thomas better be the first option to score now for the nets.
KD trying to buy another ring... weak!
Is it me or does Adrian sound like a robot. 😂
That's a ring
Simmons sick I know it…
👌
I just ordered Mikal Bridges Jersey 😢
I feel sorry for the Nets coach.
SUNS IN 4!
Greatest Trade Deadline Ever
Whatttttt
Wamba to the NETS!!
CUPCAKE
Brooklyn has young talent and draft picks
Championship
Sooo we're back to stars teaming up again? lol
tbh trading Mikal was the worst decision because think about it he's injured he won't be able to play for the next month or few weeks. Booker comes really in clutch DA and cp3 also do, but Mikal carried us while booker wasn't here are we just going to all of a sudden got to like10th place again? Real bad desicion in my opinion.
Good move for Durant.  He obviously doesn't have the character to be a team leader, and this allows him to hitch his wagon onto a ready-made situation, much like when he went to Golden State.  He'll still probably be miserable, but that's just how some people live their lives, in a sustained morose state.
Nets are looking much better without those 3 bozos.  They can go and not win championships elsewhere.
The Nets be like it was all good just a week ago
I really thought the nets had a chance this year the way they had been playing lately. Why not wait till next year and give it a shot ??
The NBA is annoying
West just got interesting. Looks like Denver and Grizz got comp
Dam Jae crowder Back to Brooklyn 😂
Mikal bridges will now get that extra rebound for me 😅
Clippers should go after Vucevic/ Plumlee Vanfleet/Kelly oubre
Way to be great Lakers yall had a shot at both KD and Kyrie now they'll both be taking shots all over yall in the West🤣
Devin Booker numbers is going decrease.. GS better get their shyt together..
NOW, he'll have 2 rings that don't count.
What Stephen A got to say now.
Cam Thomas will be a great fantasy pick
West playoff going be great this year
Nets got robbed by the west Lmfao
Dam bridges and cam actually were good players that would help them win games off the bench
Dam  can we dump Ben to at least get rid of him
The weak moves of Durant continues..
Meanwhile lebron is turning over in his grave 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The circus is over
Does any educated basketball fan think this might be good for Simmons.  I'll tell you why cam Thomas showing what  he can do. Trade crowder  and maybe Seth deal get a solid defender a pj tucker type and trade a couple of the first rounders they got and some players and a gun all star calibre player and let Ben run the team. The only thing I wish ben would I attack the rim he average 16 puts a game doing that he doesn't need a jump shot he is elite in everything else.
worse trade since rick robey.  1st time in 49 years i stop watching the Suns.  those 3 and 1 first round is enough for an injury prone i wanna leave your team old player.
Ben simmons...destructor of teams...this is his last contract. He ll go to Australia after this
How can you be a KD fan after this
This is insane
If Ben had came ready to hoop they’d all still be in Brooklyn
This is the Wild Wild West. OMG…..
Nash got screwed
Welp…..guess my Kings gonna have to do the play-in now.
Suns vs mavs WCF 🤷🏽‍♂️
Mavs vs sun’s rematch.
There's too much player movement in the NBA and not enough teams. Just having like one superstar on them. They all have to be loaded. They all have to create the next super team. I hate the NBA. LeBron going to Miami unknowingly made the NBA unwatchable for me and probably many others as well. I'm sick of this super team era, the NBA needs to write better scripts. The last one I actually cared about was when the Milwaukee bucks won. And before that it was when LeBron won in 2016, and before that it was Dirk, and before that it was Kobe and Pau gasol and a bunch of bit players. What happened to having one superstar and just having all of them individually battle it out with a couple of other supporting players against another team that had an equal amount of talent? I swear, these teams are literally just hopping on trends worse than a teenager.
I feel bad for nets fans
Warriors were already in danger, they r done with thse trades ( fakers,suns,mavs).
How about ja morant saying we’re good on the west? 🤭
did Woj just call SVP "Kevin"? 😅
And they were able to keep Booker Ayton... Wow !
The nets are a trash organazation! How do u not even get ayton lol! Joe stai is a trash owner lol! Dude is trash
Didn’t see 👀 this coming  The suns look like they ready for smoke again 💨
I can't believe the Suns still kept Paul and Ayton. I thought that if they were to ever make a trade, one of them would be part of it.
WOW 😳
No respect for him
I will say this, that Suns roster will definitely be a threat in the Western Division. KD knows what it takes to win championships. Plus, the pairing of Chris Paul and Devin Booker who have been in the playoffs before will add lots of fire to the team now. Wow!
4 1st round picks is crazy for a 35 year old player
Crazy!!! Ben Simmons led squad?? They must be skunking for Scoop. 😂
Suns are in win now. Durant will be 35, Paul will be 37. If they don't win this season it's a dubb
Happy for him but we going to criticize him like we would’ve if Kobe or bron got traded? And this has got to be the worse trade I ever seen 😭😭 whoever owns the nets needs to sell that team and that gm needs to go
The irony lol wonder what Barkley is thinks …. 🚌 💨 💨 😂
Oh wow. If Nets tank this year. There future picks are going to Houston. That means the rockets will have two lottery picks next draft! Yessssssss
Another durant super team
The nets are not done yet they still got Big Ben🤔
Nets are Ben Simmons team now
Durant are running away from the Celtics and Bucks...
I said it before and I'll say it again. The covid mandates is what messed up the NY Nets. If I were in the NBA I'd try to avoid any mandates teams, especially NY.
I couldn't imagine being a Nets fan this morning.  I might as well ask for a trade too.
WOW!!!
still have not seen a championship with kd being the man, just a prima donna.
I get its KD but jesus. Mikal has been the saviour of the season for the suns this year, cam johnson is a rising star and an excellent 3 point shooter, jae, and 4 picks when the suns have drafted no one for the past couple years.  Brooklyn's side, taking on trouble as the reason jae left the team is because they started cam instead, won't that be same problem there? interesting for sure
At this point who can take KD serious? No dignity smh… I mean even if he was to win a chip with the suns (which he won’t) who would respect it?? .. this dude is really proving he’s not that guy smh..
Dbook & Durant? It's over.
2013 Nets Paul Pierce, Joe Johnson & Kevin Garnett ❌ 2021 Nets Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving & James Harden ❌❌
Kd legacy is tarnished. He always wanna go to a super team
nets gonna be insane believe
The Suns gave up their two Best Wing Defenders and all of those picks. That's going to be tough they really needed Bridges and Johnson in my opinion.
Ben Simmons killed the Nets team.  Nobody wants to play with him.
Nobody wants ben
Suns are winning the chip
Woah lol this major
Warriors somehow let’s go get Mikal bridges ! we need to do something now, we have to react
West has now all the superstars
I remember the rapper Fabulous rapping “shout out NJ, y’all can’t get the Nets back” 😂. Jersey just said we good. Y’all can keep the Nets.
Then the plot thickens... DONN DONN DONN!!! KY joins KD in Phoenix next year and CP3 is out!!! 😈
Durant trying to buy another ring
Some teams just never learn that super teams n certain players don't cut it . If Durant , Irving n Harden couldn't thrive what makes the Sun's , n Mavericks believe they are worth the risks . Suns give up Bridges n Crowder and 4 first round picks for a 35 year old cry baby who just proved that being part of a super team doesn't work . Durant is 35 has been injured quite a bit in his career and they give up two quality players and 4 first round picks for him , absolutely absurd .  Phoenix will regret it . Some players are team cancers n Durant n Irving are two them . Warriors won because of curry , Thompson n green , not because of Durant, Durant was just a incentive.
I feel like the Nets are actually a better team now. And Cam Thomas now has the green light to shoot all he wants.
Durant is on his way out of the nba soon at doesn't matter where he goes.
This makes me angry, how can the Suns retain Booker, Ayton, CP3 and KD?  I wish them an early playoff exit.
Bro we finally create our own star in bridges and you just send him away for a soft all time scorer that can’t stay healthy in the playoffs. This is going to be bad guys we already had championship aspirations without KD. The lack of bridges defense is going to show
The west just got even crazier, my God! It really is the wild wild west.
this was the play all along. Kyrie will be on the Suns roster by day 1 next season. Joe Tsai might be the worst owner in all of sports by a mile.
The Nets organization should be ashamed. KD and Kyrie will be deep into the playoffs and the Nets go back to being lotto mainstays
Nets going to flourish now with all the toxic players gone . Ben Simmons going to remember how to play and Seth curry is going to step out of his brothers shadow and show he’s been the  better Curry all along .
Bron , KD , curry in the west. battle of the olds
Why is everybody trying to stop Curry?
Another weak KD move... 😂😂😂
James Harding saw the light wayyy ahead of time and escaped from this mess of a Team. Good luck to KD w/ the Suns. Smh!
I could only imagine how mad LeBron is right now
I would have made the Suns include Ayton as part of any deal !
Wow . That is huge . Irving was anticipated and long overdue, but this was unprecedented and is going to really impact the league coming out of the break and put the suns in the driver seat . Hard not to see them finishing any lower than a 2 seed now . I guess Brooklyn can read the writing on the wall .
it’s only a super team when Lebron does it 😂😂😂
The west is stacked… it’s only Celtics and Bucks in the east.
Suns gave up too much honestly.
sheeeeeshhhh KD, Booker, CP3 and Ayton... I can play as the 5th and still win a championship! 🤦
Just when I thought Mavs had a chance to go to the West Finals. Now I dont see how this happens.
Y’all thought Ben Simmons had mental issues before
This went from being almost the most boring trade deadline to the most exciting in NBA history.
Why would Joe Tsai do this? What was he thinking?
*Nets season ticketholders officially on suicide watch*
Wild wild west 🔥🔥
Brooklyn is so glad to get rid of these clowns.
at least brooklyn has ben simons
The west just got stacked!
What a day for the NBA. 😅
No one man is worth that much
This is tough ,suns might go all the way
The Nets may never get a good player for years until they get new ownership. They are a unloyal organization and did Kyrie dirty. NEVER FORGET THAT
Kyrie and Kd made sure they get traded before the playoffs to avoid the Celtics who beat them and broke this team apart.
Well if they stay healthy they will definitely win the chip this year. Ima need my warriors to make some moves so we can compete
All of a sudden.   Suns fans increase by tenfold.
Now Ben Simmons can really show his leadership skills.....😏
Bron pick up Ben Simmons for the cheap have him run the second unit at least you know he ain't gonna be jacking up shots and throwing turnovers like russ plus he can d up on 1 through 4 real talk
I’m loving it
They kept Ayton?!? Wow…
The Nets should just go back to Jersey
Ben Simmons about to get waived😂
Ben Simmons: Kyrie left at least we have each other
The Nets had KD, Harden and Kyrie at the same time ... do they even have an all-star calibre player left?
Sun and KD combine to beat Giannis hahaha
Sean Marks will never be a GM again I can promise you that
Kevin just needs to stay healthy and fix his hair
this bald guy is so annoying i only care about the trade risese from hes seat with every sentence geez these guys from espn are hard to watch
NBA is a joke
Nets low-key git a playoff team dont believe me just watch
KD gets passed around more than a Kardashian…
It’s over Suns Champions
I’m seeing a trend within the Brooklyn Nets organization and somehow the players(Kyrie) are the scapegoats. This isn’t the first time the Nets tried to buy championship by putting a super team together. Remember the roster with Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Brook Lopez as the starting five… I think there’s a front office problem in Brooklyn, even Jay Z sold his portion and left.
Imagine this.   nets went on a longest winning streak on the NBA. KD got hurt and kyrie requested a trade. what?!!
Well Lakers fans ya definitely aren't making the playoffs because the West just got much better around ya.   Sucks for LeBron though I still see Kyrie going to the Lakers in the off season.
Kyrie CONTINUES to look like a GENIUS!!
Suns in 4 guy is creaming right now
This guy runs away from any slight challenge
Ny Knicks and now the curse is on the nets as well🤦🏽‍♂️ the nets will never recover from this
The West is STACKED!
Im happy with chris paul... finally he still has big chance to win a chip.
trading KD for no superstar? Mikail Bridges is not even close, not an all star. What are Nets smoking? Maybe the want to build around Ben Simmons lol
In 2021 down 2-1 to the Nets, Giannis injures Kyrie in Game 3. Giannis goes on to win a chip with a legendary Finals performance. And the Nets end up breaking up. Wow.
Good ol' NBA. Just a spiral of players demanding trades etc.
This is great for the Nets. You got rid of two weak-minded, complaining "superstars" in exchange for the ability to really rebuild this franchise. Can't wait for Kyrie and Durant to request trades again
You have teams and players in agony trying to have  3+ superstars so they can get a ring and then there is Giannis and his boys. KD should suggest they get Embid as well so he can feel  more secure
Russ might go and sign with Brooklyn after his buy it in Utah no kyrie no K.D. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
another big 3 that will definitely fail.
Imagine having kyrie harden booker and cp3 as teammates but only can win when you play steph that's beyond me
Lebron is definitely not going to win another ring in west now
Durant Playing with Westbrook Curry Kyrie Cp3
Suns should give Melo a contract. Him and TJ warren of the bench come on
Haha ben thought he'd be part of a big 3. Have fun in Brooklyn, buddy.
Giving up all those picks for a crybaby like KD who is gonna want out by the end of next season 😅
This is just a sign that, if those two (KD and Kryie) doesn't win a chip by the end of tenure with their teams, will only proves that LeBron and Curry was their best teammates they will ever had of getting any closer to a championship.
Yoooooo what!!!!!!!
Wait till RDCworld sees this
The owners need to change the rules about players trying to make a super team. It's been a horrible experiment.
Did they just trade one of the best defenders in the league and one of the best 3pt shooters in the league for 34yo KD who is probably gonna get injured after 10 games?
The sun's are the Champs. Everybody go home. The kept Devin Book and Cp3. That's a wrap
They traded away a superstar for only picks. Those players are nice, but common you couldn’t get Booker, CP3 or Ayton?   Brooklyn is on full rebuild tank mode
Glad to hear of the move. I watched the Cam Thomas interview and the dynamic between him and KD was not going to fit. I think both teams will be ok. Excitement!
The Nets are now gonna be the FASTEST team in the history of basketball. They might put up 175 one of these games. Soooo many shooters on that team now.   Just glad my SUNS (Phoenix, born and raised) have a legit shot. Latest odds have us at #3 best odds to win it all. I'd love to see a Boston vs Phoenix rematch from the '76 Finals.
That’s cool. Warriors in 4
I think that if KD is honest with himself, leaving Golden State is probably one of the biggest regrets of his career.
Nets got one heck of a deal
Good for KD. The league gave LeBron his top scoring award now they need to shake the west. 😂 LeBron's gonna send a cry tweet. PSA I am a Laker fan. Disappointed my Laker's did not trade lebron for KD or Kyrie!!!
LMAO the Brooklyn nets
How does it affect LeBron’s Legacy?
I can't wait to see Mavs vs Suns in a playoffs series.
Dammit! Now I have to buy a NEW KD jersey! 🙄 closet gon look like Shaqs pretty soon!!! 🤣😅
I would have demanded Ayton as well..
Ny knicks will always be a team no one want to play for,because our player is good we play hard but managed doesn't no how to have a fun free environment team can be a family that struggles work hard to becoming a dynasty
This is the team to watch out. Been a Suns fan since 2017 but haven't been this happy since we made the finals. This might be like the 2016-17 Warriors that just dominates the NBA
He left Warriors for Kyrie, now got backstabbed and he's ditching the Nets to go look Booker and CP3,, 🤣 😂
As a Nets fan that works with a bunch of Knicks fans, today isn’t going to be a great work day.
Ayton is gonna leave soon.
Am so glad we didn't get kevin durant an kyrie ,that was a nightmare
Hopefully Darantula stays healthy for good, cause when he’s on — oh “HE ON!”
3 teams just really tried to make a staple
KowarD
Huge splash.
It’s super disrespectful to to leave deAndre Ayton out the picture… this is a regular team with out him
Good bye Iron Man and Cam Johnson
breaking: bron asking trade to east 🤣🤣🤣
Our new owner is really making big moves in a hurry. This is exciting. Booker+Durant+Ayton.  The big three have been established, now surround them with specialists.
Is KD the slutiest player of all time?
O😊
The sun is getting hotter now
Nets had more pieces now
Nets with Clax, Ben, Crowder and Bridges are going to be insane defensively
These trades are getting out of hand.
Suns going to finals
😳😳😳
Milwaukee Still don't fair them!
I guess the nets can start to build around Ben Simmons😅😂🤣
This big 3 will gel better also the ego's won't be as extreme
Ben Simmons still going strong... the last star stays to finish what he started.
Championships, legacy, ego, and super teams: god I love the NBA
Wao, glad for KD, good luck in Phoenix, Suns are the fav to win it all!!!!
and Deandre Ayton Woj
Nets will go further in this playoff than Phoenix.
If y'all know basketball y'all better be locked on to what the NETS just did. With every chatting about the star power BKN loss, they ignoring what that team instantly built.  BKN now have 4 elite defensive players who can score. 3 just entering their prime. A bank load of draft picks and a budding young 21 year old star to build around. Now I'm excited to watch team for the rest of the season and I'm really excited to see Ben Simmons unlocked. For the first time in his career he gets a team of weapons to play with. I'm not a BKN fan but that's bout to change.
Sun's have no one else now
Kd failed to lead again and took the easy road .. nothing new here
NBA 2023 CHAMPION IS OVER. SUNS VERY STRONG NOW WITH KD
Ja Morant taking Ls of late
Start playing Vinnie Mac's THEME:  Eastern Conference..."NO CHANCE, THAT'S WHAT U GOT!!"
Not cam and bridges man
Durant changes teams like he changes pants he just chasing rings it makes me hate him more
East got really weak now
Basketball fans said the same thing about KD, Kyrie and Harden being on the same team but what happened?
Nets helping everyone win chips but them
🧁
Wont work .. all 3 of them r injury prone
They will be able to score a lot of points, provided they can stay healthy, no doubt. But I do t think they can defend anybody…Gotta be able to play some D in the playoffs!
Lmao I trust CP3's ability to sink his franchise out of the the play offs 🤣
OMG 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Mavs/Suns games will have even more tension now...
LMAO good! F*** the nets! 🤣🤣🤣
ja morant now: we're fine in the east
As much as I love Milan Bridges, this was an absolute no-brainer. Mikal is an insane defender, but KD is great on the perimeter too. And KD is obviously one of the, if not the best scorer in the league.
KD can't do it on his own. End of story. That's why Giannis will ALWAYS be better than KD!
Kyrie and Kevin move west. Nets made fools of themselves over the last few years.
Just build around ben lol
Them and Dallas are gonna be a problem
This is a crazy script
It’s over for Warriors! KD gonna wreak havoc
Suns win finals
The east coast are looking pretty empty now.
ben simmons the aussie flop now rot in Nets alone!
Nets suck at big threes 😂 remember KG, JTerry, and Pierce?
Ben Simmons finna get injured again for an unlimited amount of time💀
Thank you KD from a Brooklyn fan. Kyrie eat a d*ick.
The West Is LOADED Loaded Now
Its gonna be ben's team now! LOL!
Kyrie con every franchise he has been in, not cleveland lbj won't let him. Dallas in trouble.
Bklyn fans must be maaaaaaaaad.  Lol
Ben Simmons : "Guess I gotta put Brooklyn on my back"
Durant is a great player when  healthy,  which was rare when he was with the Nets
⚡️SGA⚡️
They need to trade Ayton For Og asap. Suns won't be able to defend anyone come playoff time. But I suppose they can just outscore everyone.
Dear Kyrie, look what the Mavs gave up for you, and now look at what the Suns gave up for Durant.  Think about that.
They can trade Simmons to the Sharks for sushi, tickets for holidays in Shanghai and a round of applause.
KD stop 🛑 trying to lead you are just a basketball player.
KD, Booker and CP3 looks more logical and efficient on paper than Harden, Kyrie and KD ... Time will tell ...
I wanna play some NBA Streets.
This is this too the west will be crazy KD wow
i hope KD and the suns bounce the mavs out of the playoffs
Mark my words, Kyrie will join the suns this summer in free agency and  the new owner will move CP3 as he is an aging player
KD and Kyrie might have gone to Lakers if cry baby wasn't there.
I'm happy for kd
I'm Australian and we still tolerate Ben Simmon's. There was hope that with Patty there he would be able to keep him grounded in reality and maybe make him understand he is a basketball player not a show pony for cameras where he can wear ridiculously expensive clothes and bling and focus on avoiding eye contact with those around him because honestly in Australia we don't grow up with that as the dream.  We're chilled people, Dave Simmons who played for the Tigers is such a nice guy. In Sydney we used to have courts down  on Darling Harbor and any of the outta Sydney dudes in town would play pick ups on these courts 'it was where you were completely overwhelmed to get good runs with so man national team Aussie's and imports. But yeah Dave was just a good person.. Anyways it just feels surreal watching things unfold where now Mikal Bridges is a better player than Ben in my eyes, that guy is a joy to watch play the game of basketball cause he plays the right way and this year has been such a jump in his understanding of where he should be and when he needs to do something.  But Chris Paul man... I can't imagine how much Mikal learned playing with CP3.. When I learned of this trade my mind went straight to, apart from Olympics or All-Star have they played together? That might be tough for Durant at first as he has always seem like he'd rather be anywhere playing by himself. Though I hope they can mesh and win a title. Mainly because so as to cap an amazing and I'd say underrated career where his game has changed from the New Orleans days to Clips to now and the way he takes care of himself.. Hope it's good for Pheonix.  Anyways, they'll be fun to watch.
Welp, Brooklyn, you still have Ben Simmons.  Namor said "Only the most broken people can make the best leaders".
Nets have won the trade deadline
So much for the little move the Lakers made
This nets team is very very deep.
Suns losing M Bridges and Cam Johnson will take a hit on them as a team
Maan the Suns are suddenly looking like they going to win this championship...
Charles Barkley when he heard the news KD heading to his Suns  "bus rider."
Durant to the sun's, wow.  Chris Paul and Devin Booker will be backups?  💥🏀🙀
Woj calling SVP Kevin was all I could think about
For someone who got in his feelings because he was playing with a GSW stacked...going to a CP3, booker and Ayton squad....LOL!
Those jersey sells are gonna be astronomical
He couldn't go to Golden State so he went to the next best ..Cupcake 🧁
Like I said after Kevin Durant leave this going to be cam Thomas team
Ben simmons done fucked now😂😂
now chuck will be happy to call him th me bus driver, since he at the suns
I mean, it's KD, but the trade was still bogus asl. Phoenix didn't need KD.
What a failure…Durant and Irving look horrific…laughable even…
YESSSSS 🎉🎉🎉
This is Cam Thomas fault lol
Suns gave up the youth for an aging KD. Not feeling this 😒
MAVS really fcked themselves! 🤣🤣🤣 Mark Cuban should fire all his Front office personels!
Yes!!
suns look like a favorite now
Nets are cleaning house 🏠, and they should cuz it wasn't a Good vibe on that team with Irving and Durant together , and Durant not wanting to be in Brooklyn since the start of last season....and that's FACTUAL 💯
i think Arizona the place will be horrible for Kevin bcuz of the people their bigotted on a higher level
Suns in 4
I thought this was going to be nonsense but they actually did it… the owner is not messing about
And Ayton still there on a Max?
IF ANY TEAM GETS PHYSICAL WITH THEM ... THEY WILL LOSE
KD always makes the dumbest career choices
The Nets lost Kyrie and KD with them vax mandates and how the Nets refused to just pay the penalty to allow Kyrie to play at home. The overreaction to the H2N post (not promotion) by Kyrie was the nail in the coffin.
Bron bron isnt goin to make the playoffs again if he stays in the west. And hes supposed to be the goat huh?
now if the suns dont win it all this year, they would be all time worst franchise lol
Suns need to get d rose
Nets got Spencer and picks back ...lol
As usual, my Suns mortgage their future 🤦🏾‍♂️
Sooo Boston title hopes was just pushed back a few years 🤣
He’s going to love the Phoenix weather right now. We’re not as fast pace living as other major cities but everyone trying to move here becuase it’s nice, cheaper than other states and a balance life.
Its Ben Simmons time to shine and kick everyone's a$$ 😜🤣🤣
the nets did great getting rid of garbage with canes
lol ben simmons bout to kill himself
West is now a massacre street.
THE NETS SHOULD JUST SELL THE TEAM NOBODY WANTS TO SEE A BUNCH OF SCRUBS PLAY BAKETBALL
And they kept Ayton? Brooklyn Nets officially the worst franchise in the NBA.
All the Nets had to do was pay Kyrie to stay contenders. And if they wanted to win a ring they just had to trade for a solid big man and replace Simmons with Cam Thomas in the lineup. This ownership is too prideful and plain stupid. Starting from when Sean Marks hired his FRIEND Steve Nash, which he said he wanted to for yrs as a GM. To trading Harden for Ben Simmons thinking they won the trade. The Nets deserve this. They wanted to be GSW by getting a 1st yr player-coach and trading for Simmons thinkning he's Draymond, not realizing you can't copy the blueprint like it's homework. They can't think critically.
Alexa play travis scott - Out west😂
Biggest disappointment of a team in league history was the nets with those 3. I thought they would crush the league. When the Suns are healthy they are already good but let’s see what happens
This is just sad af, I’ll be happy when KD, Kylie and Lebron retire
I'm so fed up with this prostitution  trading market. Money is the root of all evil. It's disgusting and the worse part of it is that our lives in the west are so confortably boring, completely bereft of a heart feeling, that we watch this soulless market of ball jugglers. I need to drop out of this vicious mess...
Kd and kyrie just had winstreak with the nets when they play together. And just for some stupid reason they all just left and moved to different team. They can make another winstreak when kd comeback from injury, but seems like it’s not gonna happen.
There was no way I saw a champion with Harden, Kylie, and Durant.  They can all ball but Harden and Kyrie just aren't consistent enough
Kd chased kyrie they got unfinished business he gone be mad
Well, this is CP3's last chance at winning a chip
Fack!
KD, DBook, Ayton, CP3 vs Doncic, Kyrie vs LBJ, AD....
Lakers are still the team to beat in the west.
Ring cashier…
Phoenix got robbed should’ve kept bridges game for first rounders two good players
Let's watch the Nets sink
so no Jalen brown???? nets =🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Watanabe can get more touches now
KD is really only willing to play on stacked teams lmao
what a loser, the biggest anaconda in history
Wow!! 😮
Cam Thomas 🤷🏻‍♀️
Luka own the Suns now it’s Luka and Irving.
But why do why does Kevin Durant has to go to a team that's already stacked why can he go somewhere and build him a championship brand instead of joining the team that's already pretty much loaded
PHX didn’t wanna give up Bridges for KD 😂😂 4 Unprotected 1st round picks won’t mean nothing cause The Suns will be winning so the picks won’t be high .
the Real Reason that Both Kyrie Irving an Kevin Durant Left the Eastern Conference :   Giannis Antetokounmpo
As i expected earlier, kyrie went thru a deal with Nets! They wanted to break the team after the issues in summer and they decided together around Jan!
Trade Ben  Make sure u get a shooter  Breaking news Ben Simmons traded for a 38. Revolver lol
Bridges, Cam that’s all their wing depth KD is now a true 4 this point in his career we gonna rely on Craig? Washington? to guard the top wings in the league? As a suns fan really optimistic if they can stop dudes from scoring they could’ve held Cam and switch him for Payne
So a team is just gonna quit while in 5th place that’s crazy an trade for most likely late first round picks
Nba is filled with a bunch of pussys , there isnt no suck thing as greatness anymore, just a bunch of whiny biches trying to get fouls and teaming up. The owners need to get back control in the next cba
Two cry babies, glad their gone.
Im interested in seeing who else the suns can get to add depth to the team.  Lets go!!!!
Looks like the West has become a madhouse over night.
That's the hardest path man
ben simmons still won't shoot the basket with kevin durant out
The Nets, if they will focus with what they did for the team now, with promising young players on their roster now, they would be on the right path.
Suns got ripped off you give 4 first round picks plus a first round pick from a few years back Kevin Durant is on the back end of his career he might have 3 years left in the tank
Goodness why is it so hard for this guy to speak, every word is agonizing
Smh...Cupcake strikes again. 🧁
It will be even more interesting to see how the nets will continue playing with a great winning record that they hold. This is maybe the first team in history that trades it's 2 biggest stars while having a really good win record and championship potential. This is a failure from the nets. The organization does seem to be really bad at organizing.
The nets will be better then the magics smart move by the nets
KD just takes his talent anywhere 😂🤣
Your 32-22, 5th in your conference , 28 games to go, decided to hit the reset button. Phoenix Suns want to win right now, they have KD, Booker, Paul, Ayton. Supporting Cast,Cameron Payne, Damion Lee, and Tony Craig. This will be an interesting post season in the West.
Didn't know they had extended Black Friday in Brooklyn...
Imagine the Cavs in 2018 after trading kyrie away saying "well there no need to keep LeBron now, we might as well trade him for some average  role players" If u don't comprehend the gap between KD and Bron idk what to tell u. KD forever 🏃‍♂️
Watch this is all Ben Simmons fault
The nets are better now. All the drama 🎭 left
KD saw Kyrie leave and said I’m going. Poor Ben Simmons.
With all these exciting trades in the NBA, I haven't been invested in the super bowl at all‼️
Wow the nets were able to pull off something just as bad as the Boston deal….what a disaster
They have to all leave to force Ben Simmons to shoot a ball
Suns ... to Win Everything !! ~ U heard it here 1st !! 🍾
Lmao KD really running from giannis let’s be real!!
All hail the Ben simmons era in Brooklyn 😂😂
Ja Morant still good in the West?
It all started when Kyrie Irving showed the video and he said that his name is Yahweh and the so-called Jewish owner didn't like that because he knew the Kyrie was telling the truth and he didn't like it so he could so he calls all the people on the sports channels and all these people to side with him especially those black commentator sports commentators they don't know the truth about their History either they don't know that they are The Offspring of the descendants of ancient Hebrew Israelites and the Hebrew and Jews are black dishonor cost at all he didn't want Kyrie Irving to say that he's Yahweh he is Yahweh and the whole world is Yahweh you going to be only one to say the name Yahweh but we don't mind you like that brother say we don't mind you question Ben Yahweh but don't try to take out history from Genesis to Revelation has nothing to do with the white people are you people and by the way you're not the Jews you are the kharzars from the mountain of Europe that's who you are so you gets man because Kyrie Irving said that he's Yahweh but everybody going to find out the truth the truth is coming out so he want to go down that road and got all the other people in the media talking about Kyrie and I don't blame Kyrie for leaving I'm glad that Kevin Durant left to you came you came replacing with no with no great people you going to the Bottom now serve the Nets right now you're going down forgetting mad at a man that confessed that he is Yahweh Tim was really telling the truth but you didn't like it cuz you want to still our history and we're not going to let you still out history will constantly remind you who you are and who I ancestors were because we are the people of this Bible of this book and you're not
I mean I'm more interested in watching Brooklyn cause they got a solid squad. Scorers, shooters, defenders. Guys that are hungry so I'm excited to see what they gonna do. Bridges is underated fosho. They might need a playmaker
What a clown show. Thank god he went to Brooklyn n not my Knicks
“He got traded. He’s healthy now” - Charles Barkley. 😂 funny how they said this to Harden last year and now this applies to KD as well 😂😂😂😂
Ben Simmons still doesn’t care for as long as he gets his money.
Welp nets are doomed
Trade for Simmons you lost your stars. Simmons the real franchise killer 😂
Getting KD without giving up cp3 and Booker is crazy   When they traded kyrie  Suns offer cp3 and Crowder 😭   This what happens when your patient
What😮
Celtics better go after Mikal or Cam Johnson
We have no plans to trade Durant the ownership says.  I guess you should never show your hand. Someone still have to explain to me why CP3 is not in a Lakers uniform.
The west is stacked like the AFC!!!!
Michael Jordan is the GOAT, not James nor Durant
CP3 still on the team. It's going to end badly
The nets are idiots , you get bridges for Durant lol
Suns vs Mavs playoff series would be crazy.
Deym! And teams are not done yet.
whose team is now. It has to be KD no questions
The nets owner is the worst how you lose 3 superstars. This is what happens when owners be to much in their high horse and want to be in the media
Once again the nba teams and  players showing they  don't care about their fans base
Is MJ still the goat?
How in the universe did this happened
Are u kidding? Honestly he should have came to the nuggets
The west just became LIT. GSW, Mavs and Suns, jazz, clippers going to make for an exciting playoffs. I'm pulling for Mavs/suns WCF.
Dumbest organization right now
The site in brooklyn where barclay center was built is cursed.
Ben Simmons (2/7): _"Well, like the song KD, 'Just the 2 of us. We can make it if we...'"_  KD: 👀 🛫👋😌 ("bye")  Ben: _"'...try?'"_
now they are legit championship contender team if they can beat mavs with uncle drew and luka magic
Good for Kevin : )
Ben Simmons is a Net GOAT
0:41 that’s how Spencer feeling rn 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Brooklyn fans woke up like 👁️👁️                                                     👄
it’s a very good trade for the Nets honestly.
And this is why I don't watch the NBA anymore
If the Nets were happy to do that trade I'm surprised that they didn't approach The Lakers and say 'Give us A.D. + 2 Picks and we'll give you K.D.'  That way they'd be trading an Older Superstar for a Younger Superstar, and with their picks and players from the Kyrie Trade too plus the Cap Space they could easily build a team around A.D. And that way Lebron & KD together, that's a team that can win.
He weak for this move all the players on west just bandwaggers
Somebody get me the nets front office on the line. I'm tryna see if they'll trade me the rest of their team for 3 dollars and a half eaten can of Pringles. Pretty sure they'll take it at this point
Eastern Conference hella weak now lol
Good morning to all the nets fans 😄
Where Brooklyn at😂🤣
They didnt want ayton ?
Nets basically did a good job, they got rid of players that do not have intention to stay in their team... They don't have the chance against Boston and Bucks anyways, why not rebuild and get something im exchange??.. 😬
Nets are the Worst Franchise lol
Rockets are the true long term winners of this trade essentially owning the Nets next 5 draft picks
Suns might WIN all. I'm being brutally Honest. They play DEFENSE. Not like last years but if they want too they can when healthy. Good luck Suns acquiring Durant -Sixer Fan
Suns are now contenders
Jayson Tatum was trying to back door Jaylen brown for Kevin Durant
I live in a world where ben simmon is   the Net franchise player...
KD took GS’s championship personally
i am just completely shocked the nets would trade all their guys away. Also as a phx suns fan all my life i will say this, if we dont win a chip sometime in the next few yrs then we probly never will.
So the Western conference is officially back on Top. Funny
If I don't hear NEWS from WOJ it anit true. In WOJ we trust. Is information is valid. LoL I'm just saying. 🤷🏼🤷🏻🤷🏽
Kevin played with nothing but superstars.
They gave too much. They better get a chip this year.
Wonder if Ja is still "good" in the west after these trades lol
Will this effect Bridges no games missed record?
Now Thomas will shine at Brooklyn with his shooting prowess. The coach has an average team that can produced a result given a chance
All the best KD on your next adventure with the Suns .
NY KNICKS Fans are celebrating!
Dang son. The west has all the superstars now.
Durant seems always hurt lately. Not sure about this trade.
Can cp3 choke with this roster? Probably
Wow 4 1st round picks for someone who might not resign in your team.. 🤦‍♂️🤣🤦‍♂️
hahaha😂
Denver n Grizzlies taste bitter next
Feel like Kyrie and KD both had to run away from Ben.😂😂😂
Sun's are thiefs of the night
Ben Simmons they top player now 😂😂😂😂
They didnt give the max to Kyrie cuz they going to give it to the goat Ben simmons 🐐
Sus are my team am very happy
This generation.... What is your legacy now ?  When you've been traded to 5 or 6 plus teams ?!? This is insane. We won't remember their careers like we used to for the all time greats.  I'm speechless. Not Durant 🤣
KD get easy ring 😅 again
I think we can conclude that KD was never & will never be able to lead a team to a ring, he's a very capable No.2 ...  LBJ Steph Kahwi Giannis Only ones to do it & in a League of their own in these NBA
3 players and 4 FIRST ROUND PICKS!  Man KD is pricey
Suns just went all-in and bombed their future for a hope of getting a championship this season, or maximum the next. Durant is 34, Paul is 38(?)... Ayton and Booker are screwed with all those draft picks going out if they dont win now.
This is perfect for Kd.
Lmao everyone flees the east 🤣
What a shitshow,  this is what happens when players run the leauge trade demands every other second.
Wow west are stacked. At least no team is a superteam just duos of stars. I hope dallas or phoenix is not a bust or else they are clowns.
This could be the first time one of the top teams in their division traded away their star players during mid-season.
That's a super team
I guarantee you we gonna get a mavericks vs suns series , and watch Westbrook get traded to the clippers and the lakers and clippers are gonna compete in a 7 game series, sports are so scripted lol
The West is loaded like early-mid 2000s
Nets organization is ran by a bunch of dumbasses.
BREAKING: Ben Simmons requests for extra therapy sessions
Guess chuck was right, nets will never get a ring with those guys
I know LeBron is looking at just these 2 moves & is like "what in the actual f*** is Rob Pelinka doing in that office? We couldn't do one legit significant move". The Suns JUST hired this GM
When the avengers doesn’t work out kd always find away to assemble a new super squad
The west just took over and changed the whole landscape in the the east- west with these 2 trades!
The warriors must step up now! The west will be more dangerous and difficult now
and i thought it was Steve Nash...just business
Kd such a ring hopper 😂
At this point, the warriors need to make a trade in order to remain in the race.
The Suns finally have the final piece to win a champion
KD off to the runner up again😂😂😂
What a epic fail. Proves how ugly that super team shyt can get ugly smh.
Ayton, KD, Booker, CP…yeh good chance at ring. Now if they trade Ayton for a Mikel bridges and more then it could even improve more. But I think this is a good start 😂 Good luck Dallas 😂😂
😲wow ..didnt see that....He should hav went to Miami - stayed in the East,  The West  Got Denver, G.S. Clip's, Lakers & Mav's
What r nets doing
KD going to Pheonix just to p!ss off Chuck 🤣
Mavs >> Suns 😘
Sun's are fans on paper and some. Interior, point and to great great wings. Great D too. Don't know about bench but they going to sweep the league
well looks like Suns are my new favourite team. Anywhere KD goes i'm in. Nets went from the most exciting team to watch and to follow a month ago when KD was playing, to a full rebuild team mid season. Insert Ferris Bueller quote: life moves pretty fast, if you don't have a hissy fit, demand to be traded, and get traded somewhere you don't want to go, you might miss it.
why would theseteams want these cry babies? Brooklyn had a big three and it did not work. as a celtics fan i always laugh at Brooklyn, but now they are learning to do a rebuild.
Wow I'm so pissed. I've been a huge Nets fan and KD fan for a lonnng time. One day, I hope KD sits down in an interview and tells this whole story (like the one he did with Draymond). I want to hear the truth. I feel like the Nets screwed up big time, but maybe it was just a bad fit. Either way, I need to hear what really happened, cuz I know both KD & Kyrie wanted to make it work.
If only he would have went to the Lakers instead 😫😫😫😫 lol
Is KD still the bus driver or the rider
Well suns r the champs
İdk why the nets did not swap ben simmons with ayton
Lakers and warriors done 🤣🤣 no way they gonna win after this! This crazy
Maybe Durant can finally get a ring now...
oh my god,,,this gonna be big!the west become interesting
Ahahahaha now the nets are going to go with Ben “soft Milano cookie” simmons as they’re guy. I love it.   How to destroy your team in weeks 101 right here.
Suns just won the chip......
Nets should have asked for Ayton yikes… maybe L trade even with picks
If Ben Simmons can return to Form they are still a contender very soon
KD coward, couldn't do it by himself. Couldn't build his own team. Needed to join another
It's over! Now we're fixing to see Durant BALL OUT👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Mikail, Cam, and Jae provided the Suns with depth.. now they are a bit top heavy with their starting 5..
Imagine a Dallas Phoenix rematch in the playoffs now!?!?!
💍
Fleeced 4 players that can go for 30
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
KD really does not wanting to play basketball without having another superstar in his team.  pretty much sum up his career.
KD and Kyrie ran from the Celtics…
NBA dominating sports with the super bowl this week , wow
Paul Booker Craig KD Ayton Payne Shamet Okogie Lee Saric Landale
KD really going to have played with booker cp3 ayton kyrie harden westbrook curry klay draymond??? 😂
Nets are a good team now actually. 4 solid wings. Just in need of a star player
Stop thinking that KD and Kyrie are going to battle each other they both plan this together
I'm a Suns Fan now. LET'S GO KD
Bro phoenix got a big 4 now or something???
They don’t have a bench now frfr
Obviously it will take a few years for the Nets to do an organized rebuild and it is patently obvious that Sean Marks is not competent to do it.  The Nets did get some solid assets in the two trades but it was more about the desperation of the Mavs and Suns then his ability.  As a Raptor fan, I have to speculate that the Raptors should have great leverage playing off Warriors, Grizzlies, Clippers and perhaps even the Nuggets. I got to think that the Bulls are losers in that no one bit on Zach Lavine. But of course I could be totally wrong as I never thought the Lakers would succeed in pulling off a three way trade involving Westbrook that would not require them trading both Number 1 picks.
Wild West
We need another Phoenix-Dallas playoffs
Good trade for James Jones
Did they go over a durant x booker trade?seems nets doenst want to win no more
suns got a ransom?
Man KD has probably played with the most talented teams in the NBA history from the the time Russell Westbrook and James Harden were drafted to the Thunder all the way til today.
Brooklyn got fleeced Johnson contract expiring didn’t even get Ayton or 6 first round picks
KD/Kyrie/Harden was the biggest failure in NBA history
KD stays playing on super teams.
'omygod lol" haha
Ankle breaker 2.58
Time for Grizzlies to hang it up...
I'm fine in the west. 😁😁😁
now finally Nets can play some good basketball.
Nets had an 11 game winning streak, they were atop the east a couple of weeks ago. Come on man
Back to the lottery Brooklyn 😂
Lebron definitely not winning nothing else
So KD wanted to go to another team that was a recent NBA finalist…surprise surprise.
meanwhile the WARRIORS STAYING WITH THE SMALL BALL AHAHHAHAHA THEYRE LOSING AND THE CORE HAS NO HELP DEFENDING SO SAD
Simmons Dinwiddie Mills Curry Harris Thomas Bridges Johnson Crowder O'Neale DFS Watanabe Claxton
ネッツは終わった...
I just watched the Dallas Mavericks win the first quarter and then desperately hold on as they slowly realized that they don't have defense throughout the rest of the game. Hopefully the suns shouldn't have that problem, but it's Phoenix
TJ Warren is STILL VALID as well .. This is a team that's playing for now. Kids are the secondary
I’d like to just take a sec to say…wow, the west has…just wow, lost for words 😅
Congratulations  to the nets for the ring in 2023!
Much love to KD, thats a smart move. The Nets r a toxic joke.
as a bkn fns，i happy kd go to sun，ty to bkn no waste kd future send kd to the sun，when kyrie destroy team culture and kd future，kd is a responsible player ，hope he get the 3rd ring with cp3
Legit contenders, might have the edge.
KD’s 3rd Superteam.
More playing time for Yuta Watanabe.  Oh yeaa!
Just think now it is Ben Simmons team the Nets
the great equalizer will tip the balance of power again. the suns are a lock. it's over.
just give them the title already nets how did you not get ayton dumb trade
Karma for Brooklyn that owner needs to go and any staff member with his mindset
I'm once again finding myself excited at the thought of Chris Paul finally getting a truly deserved championship before he calls it quits.
This will make the Sun's hard to beat ,with all being healthy.
This just means no superstar ever go to the nets if they messed that up then when will they ever win the Big one
Ben it's All you Now
Kd magically passes physical,  will play tomorrow.
THE REAL QUESTION IS? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO BEN SIMMONS? LOL  BREAKING NEWS! BEN SIMMONS SENT TO CHINA BLEAGUE DUE TO PROFESSIONAL INCOMPETENCE!!
They got a lot of kyrie but had to take a fat L for Durant - they had no leverage. Joe Tsai is done with players.
You have the talent but God dont want you to succed. You will slip, and then around the corner their will be lost.
I wonder what a 3 proficient midrange shooters fit.
I was so happy about Yuta Watanabe having a good team. Guess that's done.
The trade is not as a big deal as many make it seem. Chris Paul keeps getting hurt in the playoffs every postseason then KD is as bad as Anthony Davis, his injury prone !!
Remember the time when KD, Kyrie, Harden, Aldridge, Patty Mills, Blake Griffin, Drummond & Seth Curry on the same team and everybody else were already hailing them as Champs?  Yeah, pretty satisfying to watch big names go down.  This move weakens the East and would give the Bucks a breathing space or a little bit of rest and get ready for the finals!
What superbowl?
THIS IS INSANE !
Every nets fan switching back to being Knicks fans
As a SF Giants fan I recommend that the Suns wait until Durant passes his physical before they begin to celebrate.
Somebody go on Ben Simmons 😂😂
What about Nic claxton, damm that dude is awesome
So black man couldn’t get kyirie but the new white owner of the sun can get KD wow the Asian guy is racist
KD's *PATHETIC!!!* can't do nothing for himself unless he has significant support
Wow Suns didn’t have to give up barley anything, the Nets got boned in botH deals
They don’t want these so called black men to humiliate them!   All this is to save face by Joe Spy!  King Vaughan exposed Nash! Kyrie was balling out of control and shutting up the media n their bullish!t narrative!🤭  They couldn’t afford these men going all the way…nope!😂…so they pull the plug so they can perpetuate the blame/narrative!
Okay what did Stephen A know??? He called all this last week lol
They're so desperate. 😗
I’m shocked at this trade I didn’t see this coming along with the Russell Westbrook trade and the kyrie Irving trade
Lmao KD and Kyrie have got to be the trolliest players of all time😂😂😂
Nets got robbed.    Suns gave up cheap 1st round picks and no real loss of players
He's a bus rider 🤣 😂 😒 never was the bus driver
Brooklyn needed to hit the reset button. Both Their main stars were babies . Kevin can't win FA when he's not surrounded by stars
If suns lose witch they will it be epic know
We are going for 3 peat championship.KD THE GOAT
Nets are actually a much superior team now. All the defense and scoring in the world.
Nets about to get the deepest line up🤣
Suns are stacked! Durant, Paul, Booker and DA what a line up
yikess. mikhal and cam? hope they can win championship with this trade because they gave up too much
Kd not healthy, he got about 2 years left sorry. Watch and see.
They still have the biggest and second biggest choker
Well Charles called it! This trade deadline is crazy!
Suns B+ Pg Cp3 Sg Booker Sf Craig Jr Pf K.D C Ayton 6 T.J 7 Saric 8 D Lee 9 C Payne 10 J.Lendale 11 Wainwright  12 Byimonbo   Nets A Pg Simmons  Sg Dinwiddie  Sg C.Thomas  Sf Bridges C Claxton  6 C. Johnson  7 Harris 8 Finney-Smith 9 O'Neal  10 Curry 11 Mills  12 Summer
Chris got him a ring these year he deserved it
Funny thing is that they still not gonna get to the finals.
KD be doing these weak moves and defending himself on twitter
If Sun's don't win...
Ben SImmons now the highest paid Nets player. LMAO
WOW! The Phoenix Suns got a whip 😱😱😱
A snake in the desert..
Brooklyn going to need all those picks in the future because they will never ever get a free agent to come there after the way they treated ky
Imagine the suns and mavericks meet at the playoffs. That would be lit 🔥
And the Warriors will still go into the final.
every time KD got hurt the Nets imploded
The suns really gave up all of there future for KD. if they don't get a championship this will go down as the worst trade in history
Cp3 might get a ring
How did Pheonix fit Booker, Paul, Ayton and KD under the salary cap?
As a Mavs fan. Suns looking like a super team. It’s going to be tough to beat. We will see y’all in the playoffs. Stay healthy
he gon try revive the suns
So  many insane matchup's in the west now
PHX the new GSW😂
Game over
My heart is done with "team sports"..it's like cattle.
I hope mikal and cam Johnson make there way back to the suns. They will be missed
Now Ben Simmons can lead the team with 2ppg, 10 high fives and a different fit for whenever he don’t feel like playing lmfao
biggest trade ever in NBA. best shooting-season a player has ever had with KD going to weak western conference. will he meet kyrie in conference-finals?
KD to the SUNS is cold blooded
Can we PLEASE STOP doing the tip toe jump when you speak WOJ!!
Am I the only one who noticed that woj called Scott “Kevin” at the start lmao get some sleep woj
Will Brooklyn even make the playoffs now?
The Mavs vs Suns rivalry just got crazier
If somebody offered me Ben Simmons to join my team or a mozzarella stick I’m going with the mozzarella stick
Brooklyn got 10 shooters, 6 versatile 2 way perimeters players.. if they can play well together as a team they can win it all
Phoenix Suns & AZ Wilcats = 2023 double champs!  And David Benavidez from phoenix will KO Caleb Plant on March 25.,  ITs the year of the Phoenix!
suns won the trade
Nets are a disaster.  All those talented players to get stuck  With Ben Simmons.  K.D on the low keeps putting up a road block to LeBons pursuit of 5 & 6
I’m glad Ime Udoka didn’t go there now, what a dumpster fire
Lol…just another reason to hate the Phoenix Suns.  I do hope they can win a championship.
Just throw whoever in as the fifth starter lol
So nets have starting lineup:  Thomas Johnson Bridges O'neale Claxton Johnson and thomas duo, in fast forward years could dominate nba tho
Welp... Good luck, KD. Get yours in Phoenix. Thanks for trying in Brooklyn... 🤷
3 years ago, Nets fans were so cocky and arrogant.
Now the WEST is effing stack!!
They should have made the brown smart and a pick trade last year
Thats what happened when the owner gone full woke on kyrie lmao 🤣
Suns should win the West if they stay healthy. Lakers are going no where. Celts should win the East.
Booker and KD is finna scary 😮‍💨
I am actually a little more worried for the warriors in the West now. The Mavs are gonna be more interesting, and now KD is in the West. Holy Cow!!!!
Bro what if Westbrook signs with them after being bought out. KD and Westbrook finally win a chip together??
Good now the Bucks have no more threats in the east 🔥🔥
Wizards still the strongest team in the West change my mind
Can Thomas gon average 30 for the rest of the season 😂
Bron’s been getting it hard lately, first a tough miss on Kyrie and now this with KD’s return to the West💀RDC Bron boutta be unleashed😂😂😂
That's what the Nets get for trading away LeVert and Allen!! Karma is a rhymes with witch!!!
Now it’s up to Ben Simmons to lead the Nets to a championship 🔥
Jae Crowder: “I don’t wanna play in Phoenix cuz I wanna play on a team that competes for a chip.”  Suns: *Trades Crowder in a package for KD*
And just like that the suns are back to being the most hated team, shout out the grizzlies, it was a fun couple months hating on y’all.
Good riddance for Brooklyn.
Guess Brooklyn wanted to 1-up the Lakers after they've finally got the solution to the "What should we do with Westbrook?" question by...trading KD...to one of his desired destinations from the offseason no less.
WOW
Satisfying to see the demise of the Nets that bought a super team, and sad to see that Milan Bridges won’t be getting a ring any time soon lol
Now it makes sense why nets didn’t wanna send kyrie to suns! Kd and kyrie low tried to be on the same team
Jae Crowder: “I don’t wanna play in Phoenix cuz I wanna play on a team that competes for a chip.”  Suns *Trades Crowder in a package for KD*
It looks like the powers that be don’t want Lebron to shine 😂
THIS ROSTER THEY HAVE  NOW CAN BEAT BOSTON WATCH, JA MORANT  YOU. WORRIED NOW.
All of a sudden ja not fine in the west no more 💀😂
Woj just jumping up and down in his chair lol.
Holy Fxck….  😳 Suns are scary now….
The moral of the Brooklyn Nets saga involving KD , Harden , and Kyrie is that there's not a single Alpha among them.
I’m waiting for RDCworld to put out another Lebron James video. 😂😂😂 this should be great.
Finally the ring is in sight for cp3!!! Man's cursed if Suns can't win it this time😤
This is why the NBA should have been gotten rid of the bad NBA owners look at the Warriors Clippers and now the Suns once they got new and better owners
Nets won the trade
I guess Jah AIN’T good in the west no more!
Wait, as a Rockets fan I'm confused. How did the nets trade away 4 first-round picks? We own them already
Just thinking about the trades Lebron could never get done and this type of trade is crazy
The Biggest bus rider of All time 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ja you better back your words up lol
Sooo do KD realize if he win a ring in Phoenix it gone be just like GS 😭 thats gone be Book ring its his team 🤣 they not goin to no finals tho they trade all they depth away 💯
Woj seriously doesn't sleep. Kudos for bringing us this insane bomb
Nets should’ve got Ayton
GSW trade James Wiseman for Ben Simmons now 😮 both players need a change… Nets got all the picks they needed from the Suns.. get Simmons on the low now 😮 Nets need a Center piece Wiseman !
The All Star game gonna be lopsided this year 🤣
Not everyone can form a super team and win!! Lebron is the 🐐
kevin durants legacy will never be the same smh....
Ben Simmons is looking more like a jackass with each passing day. All he had to do was score more. What happened? I’ll credit him for playing, but that motivational spark he used to have to add to his drive is completely gone. Wow.
I start to believe Kyrie was an undercover agent sent from Cavs. First he stopped grow in Boston then he makes Durant to leave Warriors and at the end destroy another potential Nets powerhouse. Now please do the same with Mavs and come to Lakers in offseason to win another with the GOAT :)
Everyone will look at these trades by the nets as throwing in the towel. However, they now have a very good team. A lineup with Claxton, Dinwiddie, Thomas, Bridges and Simmons starting and Johnson, Crowder, Harris, Finney-Smith, Curry as backups is going to surprise a lot of people.
omg are they serious ????? booker kd cp3!!???????   omg omg
Them niggas went to Brooklyn & fucked up everything they had going on 🤣🤣🤣 then LEFT LMAO
Sun's in 4
If durant can't get a ring with them he will have tarnished his legacy. I guess it wasn't Westbrooks fault okc couldn't get a ring.
这清晰度👍🏻
How in the world were they able to keep Ayton 🙄
Why do these commentators sound so sad?
The west got more stacked!! Well, it's the best choice to build abteam around simmons because he's younger and had a lot more chance to prove himself. It's better that Brooklyn got a jumpstart at least don't try to fck it again and trade it all for dumb decisions
There is a good chance Bridges, Johnson and Crowder get traded again before trade deadline. What's the point keeping them anyway. Might as well start collecting as much future draft picks as possible and rebuild. If Nets are lucky they might even have a shot at landing the Wembanyama lottery next draft.
NFL > NBA  Entitlement is real. Way too much diva like tendencies for my taste.
Nets are back to being a fun team again. Dinwiddie, Cam Thomas, Mikal, Cam Johnson, Claxton. Seth and DFS off the bench.
As a nets fan obviously I’m not ok with KD being traded but I’m happy we got valuable acets like Bridges and Johnson. Hopefully they won’t want out of Brooklyn in a day or week lol. Go Nets
suns getting scary.
Nets have been constipation for a long time, now is nearly be free remain ben.
KD a Sun, is just so wrong
Kelvin Durant 1st 3 interviews are going to be golden
The Nets "superteam" only won 1 playoff series and what's crazy is that if KD didn't step on the line, you d probably have a chip. Instead, now you only have Ben Simmons. 😆
☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️
Once snake always snake.
Im just glad for kd.  kyrie and nets office both didnt care about him.
Why does woj move his shoulders like that when he talks?
4 1st round picks…the nets won this trade easily
That's how you rebuild, sign a couple FA's, and flip em into 5+ 1st rounders and good young core players
Now cut Ben Simmons
Dumbbell
The Nets still have Big Ben... LMFAO
WOW WOW WOW  WOW
Nets won the trade. KD, Kyrie, and Harden are getting old trade them. Nets is a better defense team now because of the players they traded for. they just need to draft an offense superstar or trade for an offense superstar.
finally, ben simmons can prove himself
They just got worse mark my words
durCANT has to be the weakest superstar in all of sports history!
That's a lot of capital though.
The west got more crazy 😂
As good as Bridges is...Durant is a Superstar...Phoenix is now elite...
This is why KD would never be in the convo of the greatest ever/goat. Amazing scorer no doubt one of the best SCORERS but this is it, not a leader, Kyrie was def not a leader as well and they destroyed the Nets. Kyrie needs babysitting (idk who will do it in mavs, probably Mark. I think LeBron was/is the only guy who managed to babysit him accordingly) and he is unpredictable, KD needs so many pieces around him to win, prime russ is not enough, beard, oladipo, kyrie and beardx2 was not enough, he needs a successful team like GSW who doesnt necessary need him back in order to win
OK now I can unfollow the nets on all platforms. Look Kyrie changing the entire nba trade. Love love love and respect Kyrie. Am now strongly a nets and dallas fan
Man this guy a better ring chaser than old shaq
ALL STAR GAMES  SURELY  THE WEST IS TAKING EVERYTHING
Wow
Kings about start losing
After the way the Nets just treated Kyrie I don't think the Nets will be getting another star any time soon they just another Knicks
Harden, Irving, and Durant are all chicken 💩 when it comes to commitment.
Kevin Durant: the greatest bandwagon player EVER.
time for nets to find their new team
Mark Cuban - We got Kyrie the title is ours. Suns hold my beer - KD come here
2022/23 NBA Champions: Phoenix Suns!
Nets told Simmons we’re going to build around you. You’re our guy now.💀💀💀💀💀💀
WOJ needs his beauty sleep.
Ever since Ja said they good in the west, nothing was the same😂
The West hella loaded now.
I hope the Warriors make a move. otherwise it’s looking bad 😂
Net’s definitely regret trading away their team for KD and Kyrie lol.
Mikal 💔💔
The NBA was so much better when superstars would stay on one franchise for the majority of their careers!
Mikal 💔💔
The east  is fucked
Curry is still gonna beat KD.
Suns gonna miss Cam Johnson And MB
Lebron with the Arthur fist 🤣
Imagine Westbrook gets a buyout and agrees to sign with the Suns off the bench? 😂  Storybook ending hahaha
Nets fucked this up. You dont trade Kevin Durant with a newly signed contract!
ja morant: west is easy🥶
The Nets really traded KD and Kyrie and got no superstars or all stars in exchange. Their front office needs to be revamped. The west is the Suns to lose (if they are healthy of course)
Bro is this has been a crazy week the Russell Westbrook Trade, Kyrie Irving Trade, and Kevin Durant Trade. I am excited for this season man it’s been historical!
Ja: West is fined
Ja: We are now good in the East😭
Nets might be better!  No superstars but wow they have a bunch of really good players.  Young point guard who has been on fire.
The Nets fans have no idea how much better Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges is going to make their team. If you ask me the Suns gave up too much for KD 🤦
Blame eric adams
Harden, Kd, and Kyrie= DIVAS 🤣
Nets are starting over.
getting rid of bridges and cam johnson is going to bite the suns.  nets in the end got the better of the deal IMO.
What the h*** are they doing in Brooklyn? I've seen lemonade stands run more professionally than this
Ja crying to sleep tonight
Maaan y couldn't we have traded ayton
Ja morant somewhere pointing a laser at one of his neighbours right now
WHATTTTT....
Why? This makes no sense you have Durant for 3 more years and a solid team. When he comes back they would be top2 or 3 in east. This is crazy. Melanie’s no sense
cp3, kd, book and ayton. jesus
Welp all the Stars are in the West AGAIN!!! Maybe Lebron Will request a trade back to the East so he can be guaranteed to have an easier road to the finals. Im Done watching basketball.
My clips looked clipped for good now smh
Does Ayton want to be a role-player?  The only shots he'll get now are off of offensive rebounds.  I don't think he'll be happy in a Clint Capela role.
Durant can't get away from the super team scenarios😂😂😂
I'm not a KD fan but I'm glad he went somewhere else where he has a lot of help and he can help to the team also than staying in Brooklyn with a guy who can't shoot. Great move for KD 👏🏻
I guess the Suns are winning the title this year
nets are too stupid u trade a super megastar for role players omg
Cp3 might get a ring after all
Bro!! I love this trade!!! Whatever makes the nba more exciting is good news!
sheeeeet sunssss will be the hottest team now,, with cris n booker🫣😲 i know that kd is not injured its just an acting😅
Could Westbrook sign with the Suns on e released?
Phoenix suns definitely about to be the favorite, The west is loaded now
This was a steal considering the 5 players and 5 first round picks for Rudy Gobert.
Ben Simmons is now the team leader in Brooklyn 😂
They ain’t winning sht
KD is the biggest fakkit puccy to ever play in  the nba. Dont wanna compete. Back at it again. This guy has hacked his entire career
he couldnt beat golden state or giannis in brooklyn
Paul and Durant, many championships are a coming.
Never thought I’d see slimreaper in the desert 🔥
Bron at home broke up the whole house!! Smfh why nobody wanna play with Bron!!
This is the worst team collapse in NBA history.  This will be a 30 for 30 in ten years.  Kyrie, Harden, KD, and Ben Simmons.  The Nets as a Brand is also hurt. If a team with three hall of famers can’t make a Conference final, who else will trust them.
Too much for kd
Nets got hosed
they did not give up Deandre Ayton this is crazy
I'm just waiting here for the upcoming RDCWorld1 skit 💀💀💀
If I’m cp I’m on the phone with melo telling him to suite up him and boogie
The Bus Driver is in phoenix 😂
The nets just hand over headache players to the suns and the mavs!!!!
CP3 must be in heaven right now.
This could be the biggest trades of any years of all time especially wit 3 for sure HOF Kyrie,Russell now KD
I remember when Nets had Durant, Kyrie, Harden, Aldridge, Griffin, Jordan..
I'm excited cause now the Suns vs Mavericks rivalry is back and friends will be going at it, similar to Nash vs Dirk not the same
The nets front office are so incompetent😂😂😂what star player are they actually getting from this?
The west are congested with superstars and the playoffs race will be so tight
Its inpossible to have a big three nowadays because theres always a sacrifice..
They still got Ayton too🤯
Nets + Ben Simmons - Kyrie - Harden = KD + "Boy bye!"
AS A Nets FAN... I FEEL EXCITED
Bad trade tbh. KD Is already 34. This is a one season do or die situation. What would happen in 2 years time ? When cp3 is 39-40 and KD Is 36,37. 😢
Nooooooo....what???
The mavs suns clash is gonna be wild
big 4 in Phoenix suns  durant booker ayton  paul
The west is loaded with superstar😁😁😁
Bro... I was loving to watch the NETS play, KD & Kai duo with Claxton and their team energy and vibes, and just like that.. puff.. what are they doing??! Destroying a thing that was becoming special.. L Nets.
Cant wait to see Curry put these dudes to sleep
Nets are so stupid
So many casuals in the comments. KD is a big upgrade over Mikal and Cam. I'll miss those boys
Devin Booker will take less shots now because KD is in the house he'll take all the shots, that will ruins the suns this season.
Phoenix vs Dallas 2   THE REMATCH
west>>>>>east
BREAKING: BEN SIMMONS DEMAND A TRADE STAY TUNE
Dallas vs phoenix playoffs match up will be fun to watch.🔥🔥
Is KD going to the Suns by foot or cratches😂😂😂.. KD is undeniably fragile lately. Not sure if he really can play more games than sitting on the bench.m
Durant, CP3, Book OMG, I'm speechless - Personal Opinion only.
Lmmfao boy I know lebron fans and the media are on 🔥 watch how bad they talk about the lakers trade tomorrow
KD couldn’t pass the CDL-A with passenger endorsement test.
LOL this happened, I thought it could in the summer but it happens now
Yeah Free KD
Suns to busy thinking playoffs and finals that they just treaded all their role players smh suns i thought you were gold with this trade but you might of shoot yourself in the foot only time will tell
Brooklyn is building a wall instead of a team. THE one-stop shop for defenders.
How do you trade Simmons and not get Booker or CP3 or Ayton?
Are the nets and Tsai really that stupid? You trade Durant for pics? Seriously? They were top3-4 easy still without Irving. This makes no sense at all
The nets ruined their logo forever with kyrie hate.  How do try to 1960s kyrie irving.    And think he will be ok because Stephen a smith and the geeksquad throw him under the bus.   Noo.  We dont fk with them.  They dont control the culture and i dont think the white owners know ww dont care bout stephn a or any of them guys like him opinion
cp3 gonna win his first ring
The west is insane
Why does ESPN always give the wrong trading information🤣 I am not expecting nets to trade anything
This is ALL on The Nets for letting Irving and Durant run the team. Lesson learned!
West u have kyrie x luka and suns big 3 now 🤣 i hope west its fine ja morant
How does this affect the 2 time 3rd to be MVP? lets goooo
Whaaatt??!!
The Nets owner has now traded 3 future hof Kevin Harden & Kyrie.....DYSFUNCTION! Let's give them the credit they deserve
Now NBA is getting more and more exciting
Cam Thomas the new face of the Nets
mark my words, if Lebron wins the chip somehow this year, he is the best player ever hands down no contention
What were they thinking?
This might be the Suns time. Monster trade on both sides, for an injury prone KD. But… if they stay healthy they are true contenders, as most are top heavy teams.
We still need to get one or two more ppl before the deadline. So we can fill out are depth more 💯
For durant u got 7 players god dayum
kevin durant riding the bus again
Chuck was right all along about how crazy these trades were gonna be
Yooooo Brooklyn, what’s going on????
KD + Kyrie + Harden finna make the nets unbeatab- oh wait.
The gangsta ja morant said he is fine in the west 😂😂😂
WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT LETS GOOOOOOOOO BEEN A SUNS FAN SINCE DAY ONE FYI
KD just gets to jump to every other team that’s intact 😂
KD accepted he can't carry BKN to finals
West just got real 😳
Hooray. The HOUSTON ROCKETS GET GREAT PICKS!!!!!  THANK YOU KYRIE AND THE NETS OWNERSHIP AND ORGANIZATION
Yo Ja! Still ok in the west there young brother?
Suns on their last leg. Ayton unhappy and not an all star. Cp3 and KD too old to fetch value. Last ditch for the suns before rebuild time
I honestly think the latest 2 trades of the brooklyn nets are win-win trades
If I'm the nets GM I'm building around Ben Simmons 💯
There’s A Solar Storm Brewing in Phoenix.
Guessing Nets went from about 8-1 to win the east to 120-1
Wow 😲
🔥🔥🔥
Holyshit its absolute mayhem everywhere
Imagine LeBron getting traded lol
Back to the shadow realm nets
Lol it’s now Ben Simmons team
I grew up a big fan of the Nets during the Kidd, Jefferson, Carter Era. When they all left & R.J. was pretty much by him self I still watched. After that I stopped watching for YEARS due to the lack of championship promise. Then they get Kyrie, KD & Harden & after ALL these years I FINALLY decided to watch them again with excitement & feeling like "FINALLY, we'll get some rings. W.T. ENTIRE F. BROOKLYN!!!!!!? Front office let things get so out of control that NONE of these crazy elite players wanted to stay!?!?! I can't say I'd EVER watch another Nets game again unless they got LeBron or someone of that caliber.
I want 2k updated tonight
The Brooklyn Nets Are An Average Team,Now.Ben Simmons Is Next.The Dream Team Is Over.
Kyrie-im gne  Kevin-me too  Ben:what about me
4
This will be a flop trust me
Chris Paul over/under on assists is going to be crazy.. Biggest winner: Chris Paul  Biggest loser: Charles Barkley.... Kiss those records goodbye. 🤣🤣
Warriors might as well get Ben Simmons. 🤷‍♂️
Breaking news: Ben Simmons has been traded for a pack of candy.
Paul and Booker aren’t a prime Klay and Steph so it’s safe to say KD will fail with this team just like every other one except for GS
Count all those 1 round picks as KD cheating in present using Sun's future
Imagine Mavs and Suns face off in the first round of playoffs 🤣
I know they wouldnt get nearly as much ad Utah got for Gobert, but this trade feels ridiculously one-sided to me. Nets owner must have been sick of the BS and ready to start over.
Image the look on a Brooklyn Nets fans face 🫨
Sheesh didn't even see that
Hahahaha Kd been my guy now I can root for him since he's on my team! 🤣
Ben Simmons next
Great move. Now the LAKERS can trade AD for KD 🐍
The nets are a trainwreck
!!!
QB1: Ben Simmons
Somehow I don't think the Nets are done swapping; look for them to ship out 1 or more of the new Phoenix players
GSW might not even be in play ins 🤣🤣🤣
West is STACKED
Lebron having a I’m 37 moment rn
Everything was all good just a week ago 😂
I think nets are going to win more games as a team!  Great team pieces n patty mills.. gotta sit Simmons..  that's all if ball was real
Now let's see if Ja is still fine in the west
I love KD and Kyrie, but it seemed like Brooklyn wasn’t a good fit for them. I’m actually glad that the nets are starting to rebuild again, but also bummed we lost superstars.
Sheesh!
Hey Ja Morant are you still fine in this Western Conference? Hmmmm
Ben is next
Dang... Stars moving to the West. My team pls endure
For better or for worst, LeGM never let himself go to a team via trade where the team gave away the farm and it’s future to acquire him. He only came to a team through free agency.
Atleast cp3 got a ring
I wonder if Ja still thinks he’s good in the west 😅😅😅
That’s mixy
Suns just got old AF.....💤💤💤
The NBA is a joke
That’s crazy from a distance I thought that the nets were just winning and proving everyone wrong now it’s done lol
Not getting Ayton too is wild. Bridges has a solid ceiling as a role player 3/D guy. Ayton was a #1 overall pick and could be an All-star if he was more aggressive on a team that features him
Holy Sh!t
Going to be that much sweeter when the NUGGETS still come out of the west!! All these teams trying to load up on 🛑 the Denver Nuggets!! 😂 🤣 🤔 let that sink in!! Jokic 3x MVP & a C averaging a triple double !!
Daaayyyummm. That 30 for 30 about this Nets era going to be 🔥🔥🔥 15 years from now.
Kyrie already planning on pulling back up 😂
Suns should be the favorites in the west
*SO IS IT KYRIE? OR IS IT THE OWNER?Seems as though NO one wants to admit he's a foreign owner connected to the Chinese government. 3 of the greatest players EVER wanted out*
I think KD asked for a trade 1st nbs
Crazy how no one is saying super team anymore 😂
Ben Simmons the new king of New York
He’s a snake snake now
3 great defenders and role players and a potential star right there in that trade
This is crazy😂😂
Snakes thrive in the desert
what universe did just step into here
I dont like that trade cause those suns players have heart and play both sides of the court.. Durant.. not so much.. between Chris Paul n Durant.. not enough steam til the end and they dont have enough confidence to take the last shot.. Durant will and has and made them.. but he will still miss and from that is hesitant and will pass it.. his heart isnt in it like those other 3 even individually
CP3 getting the ring 💍
Sweet baby jesus this team is stacked
Definitely one of the most intense nba seasons my goodness
steve nash vindicated
These guys gonna become a contender or become the pettiest team on NBA, can go either ways really.
Is over now Championship Suns
I’m glad I work graveyard shift. GAAAAAAHDAMN!!!  I AM SHOCKED 😳
YES GET THAT RING CP!!!
It's my birthday today and I just got a Mikal Bridges jersey.
Brooklyn are idiots lol literally would have to give me Booker or atleast Ayton 😂
The west is getting deeper.  Lillard should ask to be traded, no way he can get a ring in Portland.
KD & T.J WARNER TO PHOENIX
The Suns and Mavs matchup boutta be crazy with Kyrie and KD battling each other and Luka vs Booker & CP3 holy 😤
What are three old heads doing up late af😂😂😂
Just joking but Ben Simmons the plague lol
Lol kd said I need all the help I can get😂
Since I watched the NBA in 1998, this trade deadline is the craziest ever
Nets looking good if Simmons don't bust
Time for Ben to leave Nets, and go to NBL haha
Bridges and Johnson way better than KD. They both defend and can shoot the ball.
Michigan State Alumni Matt Ishbia 💚🤍
Ben About To Turn Into LSU Ben Watch
LETTSS GOOO
Bro this crazy this has gotten to be the craziest week in the nba I have ever seen
Wow. Out of the shower and I'm on YouTube looking for a mtb for my son and I watch this clip. Brooklyn received some good pieces and with the team that's intact I guarantee Brooklyn will make the playoffs and shock the NBA.
Eh LeBron fans, rejoice and bask in his scoring record because LeBron isn't going to make the playoffs, or at best be a low-seeded western conference team getting knocked out in the first round lol. There's far more power in the West now with the Phoenix and Dallas deals, heck even with Minnesota getting Mike Conley. LeBron is stat padding, when it comes to winning the Lakers should not even be mentioned in championship conversation, if they keep losing you can say they won't even be in play in conversation.
The west is LOADED
Cam Thomas is going to be a 🌟.
Grizzlies about to get Grizzled 🤣🤣🤣...
This is officially Chris Paul's last chance to win a championship.
FOUR!!! FOOURR!! Nets won this trade. Suns aren't winning a chip. Lakers should go trade AD for Ben. Seeing that AD is underperforming
Nets said fck it
Can we get Suns-Mavs in round 1 please?
Ben Simmons is officially the worst teammate of all time: he refused to dunk the ball at the end of game 7 in 2021, held the 76ers hostage for more than half the season, refused to play for the Nets in a sweep, has no offensive bag, and is a heavy cause for Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant both getting out of Brooklyn in the same season. Nets fans, just jump ship at this point.
Often injured past his prime KD to the Suns....Nets should have asked for Cam Johnson too.
Teams love getting broken Durant lol that's how good he is man ...I feel horrible for the Nets all that money gone with no chip
Lol. First Booker stole Kendal now he stole KD hahahahhaah
KD is the greatest role player I ever seen.
This is all kyries fault...I hate him...
how many times need kd superstars help ??
The NBA is just done, this league is over.
All of this happen just to beat golden state and bucks lol
Someone ask Ja Morant if he's still good in the West 🤣
Ja Morant: 🫤
Those 4 1st rounds picks are worthless...bridges ain't that good...
They don’t call this part of the world the Wild Wild West for nothing
As a laker fan and us missing playoffs congrats suns western conference champs
So its gonna be the Bucks/Celtics against an 8 team coin flip. I got Mavs in the West  winning against the Bucks in the finals. But, who knows.
what a bad trade for the suns, they only have this season compete and left with long big contracts with CP3 and KD, who are so old
tri state basketball is back to the trash heap where it belongs
Kyrie-“Aye bro let’s get out of here.” KD- “Bet. You go first so it ain’t sus” Kyrie-“ aight ima head out west.” KD- “me too”
The west is insane now
Nets never getting a ring maybe when I’m 40😂
This doesn't make sense for the Nets! He is locked in for the next years.. why?
This was a major move. Wild Wild West
Miami Heat lost deal to get KD
So just forget about Ayden huh 😂
Phoenix pretty much has an all-star team 😂
Let’s GOOOOOOOO
If I were the Nets I would have traded KD to Raptors for Barns,OG and 2 First round picks. There is no great young player in this trade for Nets. The Nets Blew it.
kyrie just requested another trade
Ben Simmons 😆🤣😂🤡🤡🤡☠️.
Wham Bam! What the **** just happen!
Phoenix VS Dallas is going to be 🔥🔥🔥
Minnesota just looking at this trade 😮 KD or Rudy…
Giannis is really king of east
WOW! That's all I can say!!
If Chris don’t get ah ring off this throw the whole Paul away
Phoenix re-entered the chat...
Everybody wanna go soft at west 🤷🏻
Wow they got KD without losing Ayton and just 4 picks? Daim. Timberwolves: "Wait, we could've gotten KD instead??" 😅
Let's not act like Chris Paul is a part of a big-3 or a big-4. This is really a big-3 of Book, Durant & Ayton.
Excited for suns-mavs rematch in the playoffs Inshallah
Ben Simmons: “wym I gotta score now😐”
Ben Simmons is now the biggest asset for the Nets.  Gives them a good excuse to tank for 3 years and rebuild the team.
Woj get sum rest bro please
Wow. James Jones need some props an underrated GM doing some really good work
Bro Kd and booker omg
Hooray, another superteam 🥱
All-out arms race in the west.
Hopefully KD gets his Chip in Phoenix.
KD is in deep health issues and was traded with urgency but discreetly without disclosing what was really going on with his knees.
The phoenix suns have no excuse
Boston winning the east for sure now.
So Crowder played for half of the NBA teams now :)
What a laughable trade/situation.  The west is so tight ,good  luck syns this year lol . Paul next year bwahaaa. And  the nets holy embarrassing . Maybe in 6 years they'll be conference contenders.  The raptors and masai are who to look out for in the next 2 years
KD understood the assignment 😆🤣
the weakest move by kevin durant last 2016 continues hahahaha
I don't know nearly enough about the entire history of the NBA, but in my lifetime, I witnessed the player-driven assembly of a super team in Brooklyn, and it fell to literal atoms.   Absolute disintegration of a team. They're gone. Snap. Just like that. KD, Kyrie, Harden. Nothing to show for. Gone in less than 3 seasons. Nets Organization have hands for decoration after fumbling this team that horrendously.
Ben Simmons by himself now
Honestly I thought suns were a finals team due to Mikal Bridges the way he's been playing.  As a suns fan still trying figure out my emotions.  But going to exciting to watch them play
Wow, Suns can win it all this year
As a Nets fan, is it possible to just quietly add Ben Simmons to the package going out? We won't even ask for a bag of chips in return..
Let's not ignore that the Suns also got TJ Warren. He's a bucket getter. The funniest to me is Scottie Pippen Jr. being teammates with his mom's ex-lover..
Man they are really gunning for that chip!
My Warriors are in trouble.  We need a mobile big rim protector.
KD to the pensioner home
How did they not get Ayton out of this?? The Nets must be really all in on Ben Simmons XD
Ben Simmons just went from thank God I don't have to shoot now😊, to Oh God am gonna have to shoot now🤯
Bang
wonder if Ja still thinks hes GOOD in the West LMAOOOO
Brooklyn is nor even a .500 team. But they can be fun to watch.
Cam Thomas bout to avg. 46 lol...nets will still make the playoffs . Wish we still had Jarret Allen tho
The Nets proved to us you can’t buy yourself a championship 😂😂
KD and Kyrie both tip toe out the back door..leaving Benny Boy, high and dry. 🤭Stop it!!😂😂😂 They treated Benny, like a wet food stamp! 😀
Ain’t this ah ship?
Life just keeps getting harder for my kings !
🤯
The West playoffs are gona be FIRE. Even LA has a legit chance. Nuggets, LA, Phoenix, Dallas, GSW? Gona be some BATTLES
Lakers actually thought they did sumthin🤣🤣🤣
When Durant left the Warriors, I knew it was a big mistake.
Poor Brooklyn smh
Bro CP3, BOOKER, DURANT AND AYTON, SERIOUS?
Nets really are stuck with Ben Simmons lmao
Kevin Durant could have been the king of New York for as long as he wanted
Nets got scammed . Whoever runs the nets don’t know nothing haha
Nets just gave up
at least we have a top 3 defense paired with the worst offense in basketball
Its a dark day in Brooklyn. How didn't we get Ayton? In Cam we trust!
Saying y’all go miss bridges but have Kevin Durant y’all silly lol😂
This seems unreal? Like a spoof. Really?? Wow.
Kevin durant noped tf out of brooklyn after realizing it was just him and ben simmons💀💀💀
Two trades in one week
Suns, Mavs rivalry just got even better. 👑
Not taking away from the kd trade or Kyrie. I'm just shocked this is happening while the nets actually having a pretty good record. On paper u would think he is crazy. But in reality there is more to this.
Suns new owner Big D**k energy with this trade. He is all in on winning.
KD wanted Marks gone. But Joe tsai didnt listen. Reason why harden,KD and Kyrie all wanted out was cuz the owner and GM are dumb. Suns need to make some trade to get depth or use the buy out market. Sorry Kd is  good defensively so losing bridges isnt that big off a deal. But everyone is too scared to say Marks and owner are the problems.
Phoenix suns 1 Denver nuggets 2 Dallas Mavericks 3  Memphis Grizzlies 4 los angels clippers 5   Sacramento kings 6 Golden State Warriors 7 new Orleans pelicans 8
THE WEST JUST GOT INTERESTING
Grizzlies just can't catch a break this season😂
Is there anywhere I can put money down on Phoenix win a championship right now??
and now nets fans will drop off the face of the earth and suns fans will be coming out of the wood works lol
Nets may have the worst front office of all time
Rob Pelinka need to be FIRED for this trade, and LEBRON need to leave this off-season. D'Angelo Russell??????🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
Now no doubt they are title contenders...
This makes me sick! As a denver fan.
Suns vs mavs gonna be real interesting
Nets are a laughable franchise no way this all they got for KD Kyire and even Harden when you think about it the return was absolutely terrible...
I can hear LeBron bitching and moaning already lol. Maybe it is you
I have a feeling that KD will not last long with his weak knees. This is why Brooklyn traded him without disclosing KD's real medical situation... Time will tell if I'm right.
Woj mentioned KD teaming up with booker and cp3, but forgot Ayton 😂😂😂😂
Durant - The Snake 🐍
Imagine the Suns and Mavs meeting again in the playoffs. The already existing rivalry is there, then you add former teammates Kyrie and KD battle it out in the West. That  would be one heck of a series for sure
Joe Tsai has taken the throne for worst owner in the NBA
we love you Mikal and Cam.
STUPID TRADE by the suns! They’re 1 injury away from a reset
Oh my f god
What a week in the NBA
KD goes to another super team?
Why would the nets rush this trade and get so little….
lmfao Suns scary af now Jesus
Timberwolves are the dumbest team in history to trade all that for Rudy gobert
Western Conference just got KD and Kyrie! That Conference is a powerhouse!! Jokic, Lebron, Steph, Klay, AD, KD, Booker,Kyrie, Luka, Morant, Dame,Fox,Zion, Kawhi, PG!!! The Western Conference playoffs will be 🔥!!
Booker and Durant getting at least 2 🏆
Ja is fine in da west  😂
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😳
I wanted to see Denver in the finals (even as a Dubs fan, cuz they're an amazing team), but now...Kyrie on the Mavs and KD on the Suns, we better see a playoff matchup between those two teams.
50 cent once sad in a song, Always whit a different nig... , you some kind a ho or something?  The whole NBA is a bunch a hoes except for Jokic, Doncic and a few others.
As a Suns fan, I really don’t like this. I respect KD, but I don’t think we should’ve sacrificed our future to add another aging star. I hope I’m wrong though.
Dubs won’t be getting pass the suns this year
this is far more acceptable move from KD... suns is not a 73-9 team, if he win a ring somehow with the sun, this ring is by far more valuable than he had on GSW 🤣
Nets wow serious
Ben Simmons Nets era, let’s gooooo
Ja said I’m fine in the west and these mfs sent the blitz I’m dead 😂😂😂
Woj said Owner not Governer! Get'em, girls!
LEBRON JAMES HAS TO BE SITTING SOMEWHERE SHAKING HIS HEAD LIKE...NO FRIGGIN' WAY THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME. KYRIE AND KD COME BACK TO THE WEST AND NONE OF THEM ARE PLAYING WITH ME...F**K MY LIFE!! BUT YOU HAVE THE SCORING CHAMPIONSHIP TO KEEP YOU WARM LEBRON. CARRY ON...
The lakers are sick right now. 😂😂😂
Well the west is over lol
People were saying before that ben simmons can be as good, if not better, as Giannis if you build a team around him. We will see about that.
There's winners and Shumperts on this trade deadline
Another super team for Durant smh
I wonder how Rich Paul would market Ben Simmons after his contract?!  😂
LMAO western conference just got more interesting. Nuggets, Grizzlies, Mavs, and Suns are now WCF favorites.
two players just changed the balance of power in the entire league
They got Durant, but the suns gave up a lot , 4- 1st rounds pick, plus 4  players,, two of them  starters. goodness. Irving is a free agent after this year, don't be surprised if Kyrie  ends up in phoenix next year. Simmons is the  main man in Brooklyn now.
Suns new line up look scary but in reality not. The first issue here is the second unit. Second, is defense. Third, injuries.
Phoenix getting a ring, I swear to God
The west is stacked
Uffffff
Man the east is weak now.
I have a feeling there might something else crazy happen by the deadline.
Woj don't sleep for days when the deadline is happening
If Ben Simmons never gets another chance or gets cut forever I’ll be happy
Good move for the suns 😮
this was a playoff time move when u cut the rotation down to 7-8 solid players no lie im scared for my celtics
Kyrie is the reason the nets experiment failed. I doubt things will be much better for him in Dallas
The Suns are not gonna win the NBA championship this year…it’s a flashy trade yes. “Super teams” are highly overrated. KD & Kyrie both seem like malcontents, doesn’t matter what teams they are on…KD was with Steph and wasn’t happy, Kyrie had LeBron and he wasn’t happy, who cares really.
Can’t wait to see Durant play the warriors now
Man oh man! Things JUST got real!!!
The real anti-semites who are contemptuous of the conquering tribe of Judah, the strongest of all the tribes of Jew shall all suffer the same consequences as punishment for their contempt of a superior design and awareness of their hypocrisy and slander
Well that's why durant can't be this valuable player.. He let's trade himself from one to another team... Not good for his career.
Reminds me of the nets when they traded for Paul pierce, kg, and gerald Wallace. Hopefully the suns picks can turn into tatum and brown type players or ever more! I love that they kept cam Thomas he’s gonna have a breakout for the rest of the year.
Wild wild west....
Wow, just what they needed to get over the hump.
That's a championship
You know you're "tank" when your offensive weapon is Simmons 😂
brooklyn falling apart. i guess kyrie is going to destroy dallas next lmfao
Why did he choose suns tho? I think the new look nets is a better team tbh
The Suns and Bucks are going to meet in the Finals and the Suns are going to win and KD will win finals MVP. Your welcome!
First Russ now this??
Suns is the new GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS now
Bro the western conference about to get even more crazier
All you idiots saying suns lost losing Johnson and bridges for KD and TJ are really showing your lack of knowledge. Crowder wasn't even playing
I just want to know if Booker and KD can co-exist; Nets have assets now...
Dang can't believe they gave up Bridges and that many picks. Big W for the Nets
If they win the chip it's gonna have the biggest asterisk of any season only behind the mickey mouse ring
They just left Ben Simmons there 😂
Now Living in PHX ..this city is about to go crazy!!
It’s just me but the suns got worst & now there team is just like where the nets was with Kyrie & KD & Harden but older 🤦‍♂️
Durant joining another team full of superstars. That's the warriors, nets, and suns now. He's a lesser version of lebron now 🤣🤣
Gentile pride always has consequences but it is always too late to fix
Holy Phoenix is stacked. KD about to win another ring lmao
Chuck was right.  KD will never be the bus driver.
Your entire bench and 4 first round picks for a guy that can't stay healthy and already had a torn achilles tendon lol. And your other star player can't stay healthy either. Good luck with that. New owner just gave away their future for many years
Imagine if the nets had kyrie and KD with Simmons already 🔥🔥
PEOPLE ARE FORGETTING PAUL AND KD WERE A BUST IN OKC
That starting 4 the Suns have is crazy!
Good kd and  Kyrie gone from this racist owner!!!!
So much so for leading the team to realise that he ain’t the leader he thought he was 😂 And going to a already loaded team and then he says he just wants to hoop 😂 Now if the suns don’t win this years finals they should be considered as the biggest chokes in the history
Kd is so annoying
*"DON'T WORRY BROOKLYN FANS. YA'LL STILL GOT ME!!!"* - Ben Simmons
It's going to be the crystal team. 0% chance of everyone making it to the finals without injury
Ben Simmons going back to his traditional stats once again, ladies and gentlemen.  32 Claps 17 High fives 12 Shouts 2 Gatorades
I thought you we had a chance with dlo…… until this happened
It's Out West now the Brooklyn Mets
I wonder what's going through the mind of Ja "I'm fine in the west" Morant
So why not get the Lakers picks if you trading KD lol
Brooklyn back the the dumpster lol at least yal got Ben ... 😂
JA just dropped a 💩  😬
Nets belong to Simmons now!
Nets should’ve never left Nj
I think it was a good trade for both I like it for the nets more personally
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hopefully the trade deadline keep going crazy
The west is stacked.
Western conference is as strong as the east now. This is amazing.
Playoffs gone be LITTT OUT WEST
Lesssssss gooooooo
JA shoulda kept his mouth shut 🤐
Durant + booker + cp3 = at most West finals
I see Westbrook in either Phoenix or Miami. The Lowry experiment isn't working over there. Russ should be happy. He'll be on a contender.
Jae Crowder wanted to get traded because Cam Johnson took his starting position.. Now he gets traded but with Cam Johnson. 😂
58+1.5
Book and KD is a nightmare with CP setting up easy shots and DA being a beast on the boards 🤯
Dang... And Bron got DeAngelo Russell..🤦🏿 Everyone: the west is wide open  Bron: 🙄
Oh the Warriors got the Haters ganging up on them in their own backyard!!  If they overcome, Methinks this will be categorised as their best Championship to date.  🍿 Time indeed 😋
Daily reminder that the Brooklyn Nets All Time Leading Scorer is Brook Lopez. Nets fans you still mad about 2021 (And your ESPN Reporter that year leaving you before the end of the season to come back to MKE and ride Giannis' determination and postgame pressers towards the birth of NBA Today)
Ben is like....."What happened?"
WOW OH WOW!!!! Lebron, Kawhi, and KD in the same conference,but in the same division with Steph. Lakers, Clippers, Warriors, and Suns!
The snake slithered again.
Tf man, the nba trades have been insane
Nets should of paid Kyrie smh. Happy for KD
Let's go Suns!!! Can we finally get one soon???
Kyrie to the suns after this season
Morant better have that lazer 🔫 he needs it in the west now
This goes to show that 3 all stars in one team does not translate into a championship.
This is what happens when GMs and owners give these players too much input on business decisions. The nets lucky they have Chinese money so profit for their team isn't the main driver.
If he went to the Cavs that was a chip js
They gave up to much tho three great role players two of them young and 4 1st rounders they window is at best two years
B E N  S I M M O N S!!!😂😂😂😂😂
Well there goes my hopes the magic win a chip in the next 3 years 😅
He all ready bought a house in scottsdale by Chris Paul lol
F*** the NET'S I'm rooting for the knickerbockers
I like the Suns again. I'm a Warriors fan but I'd just want to see Paul win a ring then GTFO the floor. Just be a coach or something
Good for KD finally got a solid team
Hey Ja Morant, are we still good in the west? 😂😂
So you saying no more Bridges to "lock down" Doncic?
Omg
LOL the Suns can re-sign Cam Johnson if Nets don’t match over the summer.
Such a horrible trade for the suns and great trade for nets. You get the suns 2/3rd best player and stud roll players plus 4 1st rounders!!  For an aging star which had obviously lost a step. WOW!!
Ben Simmons has nobody left to pass the ball to. He's got to shot the ball now.
The west is deep now.  Super deep
So how does this work for the east all star starters
The Nets have a squad if they keep their foot on the gas.
Ja: "We're fine in the Western conference...semifinals"
Mavs vs Suns looking hotter now
Booker better thank God .. he's going to learn so much about closing out games. He choked against Giannis and Luka .. KD is cut for those moments. It's going to be interesting
HOLY F*CK 😲!!! This trade deadline period been crazy ASF , wow...
bro the dallas vs phoenix energy is aboutta be insane. will luka still have custody over the phoenix suns franchise as its father or will KD just seal the deal for the suns?
Ben Simmons got his own team 😊
Both Nets players went to the West.
The West is STACKED. Bruh. Nuggets, Suns, Clippers, Warriors, Mavericks. Sheesh 😬
Chuck was right: this will be a great trade deadline..   PS: hope Cam Thomas progresses into this monster scorer he's been lately  or at least near it.. without any big time scorer to look over his shoulder to, he's now unleashed!!!
What a complete waste of time that Nets period was. A joke.
KD BROOKLYN ERA officially all time epic FAiL in NBA history.. all eyes on kawhi CLiPPERS clock ticking on that epic FAiLURE in L.A. 🤣🤣
The slave owners in Brooklyn will only win booty cheeks now. Joe thought he was gonna rule with a iron fist. Ahahahahahahahha!
Now, the Suns are a contender!
Woj needs to sleep lol
Phoenix just won themselves an NBA championship.
Phoenix loses alot of depth.
Players from the buyout market go to CONTENDERS. Russ will pick Suns over Clippers. Russ & CP3 were traded for each other. KD & Russ reunite?
The All-Star game is gonna be WILD.
The suns fans are about to be even more insufferable than they were before!
Time for Lebron to go back to Clevland lol
I’m just glad Kyrie and Kevin Duret are in the West there’s no way LeBrons winning anything I’m honestly sick of that guy. He just got Russell traded with him at Anthony Davis went to Russell Westbrook‘s house to recruit him to LA.
When phoenix and Dallas meet up next game going be crazy..finally a rivalry worth watching
The nets went back to be an average team. The Lakers now have everything to become the western conference champions by losing again and again.
The suns will still deal with Ayton, but this is a huge for phonex
Durant aka Saddle up  🐎 biggest D Rider in nba history
I’m happy for Chris Paul
If Suns don’t win CP3 just need to retire lol
This trade deadline is chaos and madness
If healthy, the Suns are the title favorites now. Wow.
Nets could’ve gotten more this doesn’t seem like enough
KD says he’s stoping kyrie at all cost
How does nobody go to Portland with what’s already there? their back court is insane….unbelievable…and for fucks sake, bring back the Sonics…..we’re getting very pissed off in the great north west….just sayin……
W for Brooklyn, The suns downfall is coming.
Poor Ben Simmons 😂😂😂😂
That's crazy. The nets were on a huge winning streak and had a good chance. Now the nets are back to the drawing board smh.
Seems very tilted to Brooklyn. But Crowder wasn't playing anyway, and the Suns also got TJ Warren. So they traded Bridges, Johnson, and picks for KD and Warren. The picks are a lot but NBA draft picks after the lottery usually don't amount to much, so I think this is real solid for the Suns and the Nets. Maybe not a win-win, but I don't think either team could say they were fleeced. Just my opinion, and will be interesting to watch all the talk shows tomorrow morning. With all the NBA headlines, one could forget the Super Bowl is in 3 days lol
That man brawadis crying with joy now
A cleansing in brooklyn
KD realizing that leading his own team just isn't worth it anymore lmfao
Next trade. Simmons and Claxton for OG and FVV and pieces, picks
Jumps to the winningest team AGAIN KUPKAKE
This went from being almost the most boring trade deadline to the most exciting in NBA history, all thanks to Kyrie.
KD trying to get more free rings😂
I knew it, my only doubt is if he will reconsider nuggets, because he loves to go to rank 1 team
Suns about to regret this deal. Bridges is too good.
Everyone scared now!!!
The Nets will be sneaky good.   Phoenix is in title or bust mode.
This makes me just appreciate the warriors for always stickin together and stackin chips even more lol
Lakers in 7
Anyone want to say something about Morant was saying “that he’s fine at the West comment?” 😬
Ben Simmons: “Threes a crowd anyway Kevin. We got this! We will be the dynamic duo ☺️👍🏽  KD: 🤔💭 😏 ⛰🏃🏾‍♂️🌬
Kevin Durant trade to suns
Pepperidge Farms remembers all of the casuals and brain dead fans who predicted 3-5 rings for the Nets...
The west is immortal
BKN def winning this trade, both in fact! Only last puzzle left, Ben Simmons!
What if Kyrie is going to the Suns next along with KD, and this was all part of their plan?
Mavs , Irvin , Suns , Durant and the Lakers ?? Russell ( snitch on yo team Wilson ) 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruh the west just became the definite spot where the title will land if you ask me. And I’d phoenix is healthy they’re my favorite
The West is going to be stronger than ever
Warriors……….. Come out n play………. 😤💯
Bruh suns bout to be so serious
I knew there was reason I couldn't sleep.
Nuggets laughing knowing their rivals are giving up future assets just to lose to Jokic this season
This deal should have been done two years ago
Suns gave up a lot for an injury proned player 😂
As a Suns Fan, I'm excited but sad at the same time. Mikal Bridges is one of my favorite Suns player. It sucks man... 😫
Kd, Cp and DB is a great trio
CAM THOMAS BOUTTA AVERAGE 90 THIS SEASON😂
IT'S BEN SIMMONS' TEAM NOW THE LEAGUE BETTER WATCH OUT!!!!
Ben Simmons effect
4 first round picks from phoenix to the nets all unprotected
SVP just trying to go home for the night and woj like nope we staying up for this…together 😂😂
This man woj does not sleep lmao
Mavs vs Suns Western Final is very possible
Why Woj always bouncin like that when he talks lmao
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Kevin durant has the heart of a fkn pea. Lol at the New Jersey Nets, but KD man. Dude just has no cajones. Another stacked squad to make it happen.
The Suns are contending now. It will be interesting to see how these guys spread the ball around and if they have enough depth.
So mean to tell me that those bastards got Booker, Paul, KD and Ayton on that team. Suns ain't playing NO GAMES.
Ein interessanter Deal. Ab der kommenden Saison haben die Suns nur 5 Vertragsspieler plus eine Spieleroption für Wainright und Saben Lee. Im Sommer haben die Suns ein neues Gesicht.
Suns gunna be pretty flippen goood 😂
Lakers- we made trades to contend   Suns enter chat
Kd gone do what Dirk did in 2011…
lol & phx still gon get out outta playoffs in semifinals
Hey Joe Tsai  .... Hebrews 2 Negroes. Hahahahaha
ONE INJURY AND THIS TEAM IS USELESS
Finna to get me a KD Jersey now. been asking for him
Horrible deal. The nets are horrible
Tony starks just snapped his fingers, the nets are worse then the Knicks again, all is right with the universe
They played m.y boi Ben Simmons 😂🤣🤣
Hey, can somebody go over there and check on Bron🤒
If the suns stay healthy they are winning a title
Ben feelin' like a pariah rn
lol😊
They got a Big 4 in Phoenix now? Scary hours.
Ben Simmons: who the f can i pass the ball now 😂
Now the mavs vs suns series going be fun and for ja let’s see how fine u finna be in the west now 😂
I did not see this coming! I was expecting KD to get traded in the summer!!
Can PHX take GM S. Marks & Mayor Adams too??
REAL NETS FAN I LOVE THIS
Nets tried this twice already. U can’t buy championships in this league
Welp, there go the Nets.
The West playoffs will be crazy🔥...from the first round. Every matchup will feel like Western conference final.
No defense at all not gd move
All that while keeping Ayton. Great job Phoenix
You guys don't know it yet but Ben Simmons will ball out this year and get a contract extension.
What happened to Joe Tsai saying he's not trading kd? 😂😂
The suns have had 1 good first round pick in the last 20 years and that’s Booker. Picks mean nothing for the suns. This was a championship move and the suns are pushing for a championship now
The only winner here is Brooklyn nets
WOW!!!!!!!!
Next/ LaMelo/ for/ Lebron
Wow Joe Tsai went asian gangster on Lakers. Even if kyrie goes to them next year no way they beating the suns
Michael Bridges was a big loss
Phoenix was desperate for this move.
Warriors had a better package but whatever Joe Tsai
The Nets are going all in on Ben Simmons!
J.Morant right now??? No worries in the west???🤣
LeGM
Kd and Kyrie era will go down as the biggest failure in NBA history
Inflation big 3 made of glass
Dubs get Ben for the cheap
Jesus Christ 😂🤣😂😂
Wow
Where tf did the Suns get 4 1st round picks to trade
Thank you Bridges and Johnson. I’m really going to miss you guys. Forever Valley Boyz✌️💔
Paul might finally get a ring
What a bad deal mikal cam and crowder ? Talk ab mid… 4 1st is cool and all but I feel like that’s a guarantee for KD
nets fans rn, i would be devastated. some bs
Nets screwed themselves by sending James Harden for Ben Simmons. Stupidity! Then the NY Power establishment screwed the Nets with the vaccination requirement in NYC while it wasn't  universal across the country and the double standard became more obvious when migrants in the thousands were allowed into United States and NYC
Steal
The NBA Playoffs just got a bit more interesting. 🤨🤔
KD IS A SCRUBBBBB
I think the nets won
Wow! Expect Celtics vs Suns in NBA Finals... 👀
Nets is the $hittiest organization in NBA, how did they lose Harden, Kyrie and Durant in one season? Lmao
The Nets got fleeced , yikes 😬 😳 😅
4 1st round picks, nice
Chris Paul is getting his ring!
Nba really let the nets give kd away for a used pad and a licked on peppermint
Yoooo what is going ON!! I thought this headline was a joke at first
Why do I smell revenge?
OKC - " _How to Lose 3 NBA MVPs: A Guide for Dummies_ " BKN: "Fascinating." BKN: "Masterpiece..." BKN: "Where would I be without this book?"
Net's fans numbers down by 90% in just a week. 🤣🤣🤣
New suns owner, try make some early noise!
Holy S***!!!!!
Nets won this trade and it’s not close
Lol KD gonna get a 3rd ring, snatch 11th place all time from paper Curry 😅
Wow
I'm a Mavs fan but I want to see healthy Warriors vs healthy Suns in a 7 game series.
Nets won this trade.
Can't wait for RDCworld1 to make a video about this 😂.
How did the nuts allowed himself to get the nest in trading Kyrie and Kevin Durant that's crazy
not beating the nuggets
Now if we get the Mavs-Suns series it got some more juice
MAVERICKS, PLEASE TRY TO GO GET LAVINE AND ANDRE DRUMMOND! THIS IS BS
Anyone almost caught Scott Van Pelt swearing 😂 on live tv?
As some who lives in phoenix, omg. If healthy, we'll have a shot
The West aint nothing but elite squads now.
How did the nets not get deandre ayton
joe sai want to build around ben simmons then
Suns vs Warriors or Suns vs Mavs. Don’t know which makes for a more exciting WCF matchup.
Suns starting 5 is nasty
WOW!!!
The Suns just got even worse. No depth. KD and Booker be injured in crucial times. CP3 as well. That's really all they have now. Ayton. Slow team.
Best trade deadline ever.
The bucks are still the favorite to win the 🏆.
Charles Barkley must be flipping out right now!
CP and D Book gotta get it done this year! No excuses! 😳
🌞 rising. 👀👀👀
Luka just adopted a new son! Congrats Luka on your new bundle of joy!
Ja Morant got a way out on his No West Team stand in their way soundbyte. he could now easily say...KD amd Kyrie just made it harder....
I'm a suns fan, I do not like this. Feel so sorry for bridges
West is CRAAAZZIIIII! dafaqqqqqqq!!!!
this is crazy
I actually love this for the nets. Get out of the drama and the super teams that never worked for you, stop trying to be the knicks. Build on your young guys like Claxton and Cam Thomas, add great talent who is also young in Bridges/Johnson, let your young coach develop the team and you have a ton of picks now you can make more trades in the future. Superteams never worked for the Nets
Nets Really Traded Kevin Durant for Bag of Chips and Nachos lol
34 year old KD NOT EQUAL to LeBron and a very* old Chris Paul.
It really wasn't that long ago when the Nets had just acquired Harden, Kyrie and KD and looked like they were going to dominate the NBA. Crazy how much the landscape of the league has changed.
Crowder aint that good 😆
Mavs vs Suns is going to be pretty awesome this year.
Good for jersey man now ship Ben to Utah for russ
Kd recruited Stewie and left😂
Me as a cp3 fan I didn’t want both cam Johnson or bridges to be gone but shot I wish they at least would’ve kept one of them if they did this team a be scary not to forget ayton too
Suns instantly become the favorites and role players are gonna instantly want to come play with them probably for less $ but just to win the chip.  If KD can't win a chip with this team then he probably never win another one
Nets should have also gotten either ayton or Paul in that deal. That’s KD u talkin bout..L for Bkn.
Not Bridges and Cam!!!! Wow! I guess that couldn't be helped if they wanted to get Durant. This will be very interesting. Bridges did so much for the Suns. I get its business but wow. That's unfortunate for Cam too. There will be a lot of fans disappointed. If PHX wants a championship, this could do it.
KD getting onboard another luxury bus
Ben Simmons, traded to the Australian Alligators, for gum, trading cards and shoe strings. Will be the next trade
The west are underrated now  Mavs have Kyrie Lakers have D'Lo Russell, Beasley & KD to Suns
How did the nets let PHX keep Ayton? Lol Ayton is a must to get that trade done.   Worst managed team in the league.   Best trade of the last 5 years for the suns.
Time to go get melo
Why not Kelvin Durant to the miami heat? I just don't like the politics at all
Nooooo not KD!!!!!!
Wow.... So basically.. the East is back to the Leastern conference again. 😂 Pretty much laid out the red carpet for the Giannis. Looks like Cavs have a chance at making it further than I thought they would now. I had them making it to the 2nd round at best. Happy Harden, KD and Kyrie got up out of Brooklyn. That organization ain't it..
I'm very mixed. I loved bridges and Johnson.  And that's alot of picks. Hopefully durant stays for his whole contract.
Welp lol all depends on health now in the west
They going for a ring y'all 😁
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!
West playoffs would be extremely interesting
Bye bye Memphis
Imagine nets winning it all this season lol
1 person change a lot of lives
Down the stretch we go
lmao the NETS will be irrelevant for the next 10 years. Funny that all these reporters or insiders had no idea this deal was taking place, they all said KD won't be traded before deadline.
Kyrie vs kd wcf Mavs in 6
Just when I thought my Lakers made some good moves 😑🥴
WHAT ARE THESE TRADES! First I saw the westbrook trade, then not even 2 hours later, mf KD got traded. THE WEST IS STACKED.  I hope these trades switch up the scene for the playoffs, and get more intense match ups.
Haha I'm so happy, those Brooklyn picks are looking like gold. Go Rockets.
Wow what kinda trade is this?😂
Woj is so cringe 🤡👎🏼
nooooo waaaaay
Ja is crazy. He’s overrated. What u mean your fine in the west. They gettin bounced first round
HOPEFULLY MIKAIL YOU CAN PLAY AT HOME 🏠 WITH OUR SIXERS IF YOU GET A BUY OUT
I know Jacque Vaughn like Dam I thought I was gonna have KD and Kyrie dam coach but now you gotta prove u can coach
Oh noo.. that means nobody wants Ben Simmons!
Chris Paul smiling like a mtf rn
🥷🏽KD!
No bench, they won't make the finals.
He’s in a team with two people who constantly get hurt when it matters .. DURANT WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?!!!! 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Daddy luka would be proud🤣 mavs in 6
Basketball is broken 😅
What the
I know some of these names going to the nets aren't superstars, but in terms of quality depth, the nets are working with some heat once they figure it out
At least we're rebuilding I'm all in for it.
This is crazy, no other league allows this kind of movement of players
You still can't do what the Golden state warriors have already done woooo!
I was picking the Nuggets to win the west. But oh have the tables turned.
*STOP PLAYING !!!! NOOOOOOOO ITS OVER SUNS WIN NOOOOOOO! CP3 at point he gone feed KD easily, DEVIN BOOKER , is gonna demand attention you can’t leave him open! It’s over these team is unstoppable KD has manage to do it again to squeeze himself on a already solid team NOOOOOOOOOOO*
Anyone else notice how Adrian mid-jumps out is seat with each sentence 🤔😂?
What scoring title? These trades man
Nets playing for the Wambayama pick. Tank the season and get as many pics as possible.
Ok so now 7 All-Star Starters are in the Western Conference.
AINT NO WAYYY! WEST IS STACKED TF
W🔥W!
Honestly the nets could surprise us all
Great deal for both teams honestly
ppl been saying suns aren't good, but they sitting in 5th, comfy, and now have cp deandre kd and Doncic's boy
OMFG Chris Paul my get a ring after all lol
Love svp!
Now they should get rid of Ben Simmons!
Mavs no KD Trade ??
The suns gotta be the top contenders in west starting immediately lol no need to wait and see how they fit we all know kd just wanna hoop but just so happen to be one the best scorers of all time paired with booker cp3 and ayton..let’s get this ring my boa
The Suns will have no defense. Nets 2.0
Can't talk about Bron least bron built his team kd just joining mfz to get a ring I see 1st or 2nd round exit
How about Ja Morant? Im fine in the west?🤭
Whaaaaaa……….
If nets r smart they let Simmons average the triple double on the rebuilding team and build up trade value
its soo not worth trading away all your role players. KD is great, but look what happen with nets after they got harden... this team didnt had depth. and now suns do same mistake. also 4 pics?, if this doesnt work out then you prob fucked in future .  i think this trade is very good for nets tho. they finally could rebuild this team. ofc ben simmons contract is still there which sucks, but since they gonna prob tank now it shouldnt matter
Think Ja is still “good with the West”?
As a Bucks fan I can safely say that Game 7 in 2021 broke the Nets organization. Because we went on to win the championship that easily could have been theirs. Anyways DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD! (Which team is their PA Announcer gonna jump on next?)
Last weekend of football and the NBA is gettin hot right in time
Paul Booker Ayton and KD - Suns now the number 1 pick off the Titel - Bucks Celtics Nuggets 😂😂 Lakers 😂😂😂😂😂😂. Suns make it Right - please Mavs vs Suns
So Harden should come out of the east right
CP3 got shown up last playoffs as just an old slow nba player… and so did booker as a one-dimensional one-trick pony who could be shut down with good defense. Suns gave up a lot for KD gambling on CP3 and Booker both being able to show up in the playoffs and be much better on both sides of the ball.
Just when the sun's window was almost closed,
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 give them the Chip
Crazy move to let go of kd, it's like the nets totally gave up going for the championship. I thought they would at least try with kd.
Nets got some good pieces and 4 FIRST ROUND PICKS. The nets will enter the rebuild phase but getting some good pieces and first round picks is a good start.  Now they got to get rid of Simmons, now way does that guy deserve his salary.
Rockets win the trade deadline they have the nets pick for like 5 yeara
Feel bad for the Nets, but they have a chance to build around Cam Thomas now.
KD played with every superstar PG in the 2010s
Get rid of Chris Paul now
Warriors need to get Lebron or something 😂
Are we gonna just ignore the fact he called Scott Van Pelt "Kevin"?
The nets had 2 All star starters and now they have a team full of role players.
Holy...
KD VS Kyrie in Western conference finals.
Phoenix was really trying to snag Kyrie also for CP3😅. Just imagine that lineup: Kyrie Booker Craig KD Ayton
CHAMPIONSHIP OR BUST PHX!!! LETS GOOOO
Suns now have Book and KD while keeping CP3 and Ayton. Crazy. Plus Don forget the other young guys on the team who are balling as well. The Suns are going to be an amazing team!
Imagine the Brooklyn season ticket holders.... They pay before the season and half way through tickets are now 20$ for floor seats...
i am now confuse on the all star now. KD just went back to western conference.
Suns are instant favourites now, Booker + KD. 🤯
WILL MISS MY PHILLY BOY MIKAIL BRIDGES
Suns got finessed 4 first round picks and 3 solid role players !! Kd is gettin old and won’t be there long if they aren’t planning to win a championship next year this was not a good trade
Hands down best trade deadline ever.
And they kept Ayton,  they straight up  got robbed
Just a few days ago it was reported that the Nets had no intentions of trading Durant. Another reason to take all reports with a grain of salt
West are locked and loaded...
And fact if the matter is. This dude Durant is gonna have to play some defense this year. No lie.
PointGod CP3 may get a chip cap off helluva career after all 💯💯
Lebron need thanos... West becomes so stack
How did the suns get to keep ayton wow!!!!
They need to get CP3 out of there and Kyrie need to sign to phoenix in the off season
Can't wait to see the RDCworld "lebron reaction" skit.
Not sure how the Nets didn't even make the finals with those three. The East is basically gone. I bet Westbrook gets traded to the Nets now 🤣
jae crowder is still gonna be playing behind CAM JOHNSON 😂
Omg this is crazy!!! Suns definitely should be title favorites
The Knicks can’t land superstars and the Nets don’t know what to do with them when they have em…as a New Yorker I gracefully bow out.
Nets just said F everyone they out!😂
Suns never won a championship in their history. They will in June. But I can imagine the media will paint LeBron as the hero and KD as the villain like in 2016-2017.
Crazy, Nets is in rebuild mode, Knicks is trash 🗑️, New York City basketball sucks
I would of traded Chris Paul and kept Bridges Paul robbing the suns
sheeesh!!!!! wow!!! everytime this man moves teams the nba earth shakes....
the bridges tweet🤣🤣
Lowkey Lebron is saying, “I just passed Kareem, got rid of Russ and this is what y’all do to me, I am 38.”
All these teams getting what they want while Miami Heat cannot even get a fly.
Ben Simmons wants out
Nets gone back to irrelevancy. the west is stacked. its clear the suns are favourites cp3, booker, aytun, durant. thats a big 4. only thing that can derail them is cp3 health.
I'm the biggest KD fan but not happy at all rn 😒
C'mon Philly pull a rabbit out of your hat.
Nets made it clear that they’re ready to focus on basketball related activities. They’re removing all the drama and unnecessary bs outta the franchise. Now they just gotta trade Ben Simmons. Now idk who taking that contract. Only way I see a team taking him is for the free99.
imagine New Yorkers going back to Knicks games lol
Westbrook to phoenix?
Breaking "not so great" news... Simmons wants a trade! Anyone? Hello GMs 🤣
Nets are like f***k it.
Craziness. He left a very sad situation in Brooklyn. Listen..listen very carefully. The Nets season was a wrap before they acquired James Harden. That teaaaaaam was well put together with thee most solid bench in the game. That was a guaranteed championship. Proof? These fools just traded back for Spencer Dinwiddie. Crazy. They got a lazy confused James Harden who was amongst the best of all time scorers ever. To turn into a point guard overnight. What now you think you John Stockton? Come on !!!! And then asks to be traded mid season. And again he wants to be traded out of Philly to go back to Houston? This is sad. I hope for the best of those two. This organization was terrible from start of shares and backing out from “you know who”. To trade away like all your players just for Harden was upsetting and very sad.
joe tsai destroy the balance in the west lol
Let’s not forget, KD is 34 years old
Chuck was right. Best trade deadline 😅
Bridges tweet lmaoo
All this to beat curry
Already knew KD will ask for a trade. I wanted him to go to Portland with Dame Dolla. Man.. Suns were least expected.
It's crazy, the KNICKS had more/better pieces to trade to the nets🤦🏾
The Brooklyn Phoenericks
Warriors better make a move. They looking mighty lackluster now
Ben Simmons has two options work on his jumpshot or twitch steaming.
Crazy!
The most hated team becomes even more hated. NBA is reverse Star Wars. Evil empire have always been the Lakers. But media supports them and hates the underdogs.
Wow, I feel for Brooklyn fans. They looked like a team to contend in the East these last few games. Now both their top players are gone. It just came crashing down.
The warriors are to blame.
The KD and KI era was a huge failure
Call Westbrook see if he still wanna be a 6th man lol
Just when LeBron thought he got the help he needs in Russel
Ayton, Book, CP and KD??? Oh, my.... I'm not even sure a fully healthy GSW team could beat this team.
Lakers should be shopping Bron right now.
Wonder if simmons starts avg 30 10 and 10 now lol
GSW must find away to gett buddy from pacers
WHAT THE F*CK  First Kyrie, then Westbrook, and now Kevind Durant. This week has been INSANE
Never compare KD and Bron ever again this dude has played with literally 10 all stars and 3 different super teams
Are you joking me Kevin Durant going to the phoenix suns he is going to be a cheat code
NOW PICK UP CARMELO ANTHONY to booster the SUN'S bench
KD bus riding journey continues.
What a deadline, the whole west is afraid of the Memphis because of Morant saying the he is okay in the west. He force Luka to team with irving, KD to Booker and CP03, Alarm the Lakers to give AD and Lebron co-stars and good role players.
The Suns kept Ayton 🤔 the NBA just made the west ultra competitive 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Wow, how much the Nets regressed. They were considered a championship team but ended up with nothing. Reminds me of the '97 and '99 Rockets.
man...i was hoping the raps would get it done lol :(
Ben Simmons 25ppg 10ast 8rebs
Kevin Durant switches superteams like Bruce Jenner switches genders
Bro craziest trade deadline ever
Love the trade but mad suns lost bridges !
HOPEFULLY DURANT YOU BRING PHOENIX TO YHE PROMISED LAND
Suns going to the finals 😂
Jesus christ man. 😔
Claxton needs a new home…
Western conference is stacked
Imagine a Dallas vs Suns rematch
Wow
Right... and Steve Nash was the problem... lol
I know Lebron pissed LMAO😂
Loosing Bridges and Johnson is gonna hurt the suns. Who's gonna play defense?
LAKERS ARE DEAD
Phx winning chip
FIRE NETS OFFICE
Can’t wait to see the suns blow up like the Nets Did it’s gonna be great !!!
W Week for the NBA. 2 fights break out last week, two blockbuster trades this week.
I'm stunned the Nets didn't get Ayton back like how did they make this trade without getting Ayton?
next ben simmons requesting a trade 🤣but none wants him😂
Nets front offense getting cussed out 😂 3 all stars traded for  7 picks and 6 players... Gobert alone got most of that
Now i understand Durant wasn't injured he was just tired of the Nets!
Woj’s favorite time of the year when he’s the center of the basketball world 😂
imagine starting out with kd, harden and kyrie....
This  could get them the chip This year or at the very least wthn the next 3.
The Nets, my God, the Nets. What have you done?
I wish bridges could’ve stayed
Lakers fans mad asf right now they thought the did something 😂
Big W for Nets. KD is a legend, but without Bridges that Suns team is way too sus on defence. They've got solid players & a great set of draft picks. Now get rid of Simmons for maybe a Bogdan Bogdanovic and you can set a solid core and yet have draft capital
Ben Simmons will be carrying the nets 😂
Welp looks like Chris Paul will finally get his championship
I knew KD was not sticking around when Kyrie left. And he for sure was looking at the Nets like this ain't good enough to beat anyone. Suns came up I think that was a good move. Sun got a shout to win a title this year. the west is wide open.
BuTs wHaTs LEbrON’s TaKE oN ThIS??
Man KD has played with almost every superstar in the league. I just don’t see this working.  Same team as he had in booklyn. I think the nets won that deal.  Suns don’t have that fire anymore
KD stay cheat'n
Breaking news: LeBron is heading to Dallas and Phoenix at the same time.
Suddenly the suns are now the number one team in the west....
Nets are the biggest L franchise of all time.
Ben Simmons… Can you name me a worst contract in this league guys lol.
Kytie and KD saw enough of Ben Simmons. They gone. Thanks Nets.
KD. Is the weakest superstar of all time.
*WOW*
Durant’s career will be remembered hilariously 😂
Man the league hates the lakers 😕
Shannon tomorrow... KD is a runner, he's a track star!
Is Stephen A Smith he going to Boston 😂😅🤣
So what’s gonna happen to the All star?? Kyrie and KD moved to the west.
Imagine if they picked up Russ on the buyout market solid points off the bench he was giving
Well, Nets games gonna be lit with Ben Simmons as the only "star" player there.
Can’t wait for undisputed tomorrow 😂
Good move but they got rid of most of their defense
if he get 35 like OKC days things will get spicy  but wow Cam or Mikal needed to stay Shamet and Lawndale dont get the job done but i like Washington and that #39 kid and Payne and Ayton but wow
They blew that sh** tf up😂😂😂
Yeah that’s wild for them to have Cp3, Dbook, KD, and D A at center that’s gonna be wild
Wow. What disappointment for NY.
this will not take away the fact that durant still needed steph. If it were just him and kyrie on a team with role players competing for a championship, you got me. This ring if he and phoenix were to win it will not enhance his legacy by much.
Nets had 2 mega super stars and go no one in return for them. What a joke of a team.
This trades in west are soooo crazzzzyyy
Ben Simmons gonna have some abandonment issues now.
Give Ben the keys 😅
Bruh, I'm moist
What about Ben 😂😂😂😂
The west just got crazy good
I'm going to miss Mikail Bridges
Holy smokes BatMan
Bro how does Jae Crowders family feel about constantly having to up and move every year/ couple of years?
wow. gotdamn Sixers yall mfs should have made this mf move!!! TF!!!!!!!!😡
Sorry Lakers you had a good 3 hours though.
Love how Woj just reported yesterday that the nets have no intention to trade KD
CP3 Booker  Torrey  KD  Ayton   Bench: Payne, Shamet, Lee, Warren, Landale, Saric, Bismack, Okogie   THIS IS UNFAIR. 🤯
Lmfaoooo Chris Paul wasn’t allowed to be a laker with Kobe. Now it’s Paul Booker , Ayton , and KD lmfaoooooi
Not a competitive bone in KD’s body
2:23 Lmao Mikal Bridges just rolling with the punches
Sun's vs mavs 🔥
UGH.
Memphis, New Orleans and comp are in trouble now 🤣🤣
The west is stacked now
Basically phoenix is Walmart 2017 warriors
The NBA is getting competitive again…🔥🔥🔥
As a Rockets fan. Thank you Mr. Durant. 🤣🤣🤣
They don’t want no part of Ben Simmons.
jo Tsai Owner  waste money  kd kyrie lose hahaha
Lol simmons be like i sjouldve stayed in philly
They already won!
Oh my Jesus!
Melo will sign with the Suns soon!!!
The Nets are not that bad if you look at their roster, except for Ben Simmons 🤣
I just bought a KD jersey last week 😅
I’m honestly speechless
I think nets will stick on ben, claxton and spencer 👀
Nets got fleeced!!! Hahaha they couldn’t even get Ayton in return. Those 4 first round picks will be absolutely trash!!
The suns are about to destroy the league for the next 5 years
This trade puts Phoenix Sun,  over the top on the West... Great pick up...
😳
I’m so glad they freed KD and sent him to his wanted destination
KD, Ayton, Paul and Booker! This is gonna be fun to watch. KD historically fits in everywhere he goes.
Everyone about to find out that KD is the best player right now lol. The nets ownership failed so hard. They’re basically the Houston Texans of the NBA.
What do the nets do with Ben now? Cut him?
LBJ to the Knicks now.
Scott doesn't even like sport if he doesn't want to stay there for this let me do he's job
AS A NETS FAN....  I FEEL DEAD INSIDE.
Unless the nets fall off a cliff, it’s going to be interesting to see what they do in playoffs, who else agrees?
Why am I not working in some teams' front office?///
This suppose to be Superbowl week and everyone just talking about NBA😂😂😂
Bruh I'm happy for Kyrie and KD...but I feel defeated right now. Walking past the Barclays won't be the same.
Biggest loosers in this trade -  Ben Simmons Ja Morant
This is like one of those trades that you only see on 2k 😂😂
Brooklyn really just had 2 all star starters a week ago. Now they have none
Id be so pissed in i was a nets season ticket holder.
😳🤯‼️
Did Suns try to trade for Kyrie earlier 🤔?
Epic trade deadline this year
As a Nets fan I’m sad and I’m relieved. I wish KD well, and I’m happy to get Bridges and Johnson back
Lakers wasted that 1st they not winning regardless now
These teams are clutching trades at the last minute
The Nets are the definition of why bad organizations stay bad. When the people who don’t play basketball think they are bigger and more important than the guys who do, those organizations never win big…
I mean, you have all the superstars in the West : Curry, LeBron, KD, Jokic, Kawhi, Zion
KD had the keys to the nets and now he’s bailed out. KD got unlimited passes.
The world is going to wake up to a different new world of the Western conference!;) the West just got a whole lot stronger nd more competitive!
Bruuuuuh 😮
NBA is broken
That nets team was the worst assembled🤣🤣🤣and to think that Ben Simmons has no trade value lol
They ain’t winning a championship 💀🤣 🤡
LMFAO. Kyrie and KD was just like, "aight I'm out." Sucks to be the Nets right now.
Ben simmons will b leading the nets with a triple single season 💀
Suns in 4
Ja is probably having a heart attack rn
Sun's going to the finals, that's Law
If they suns stay healthy there gonna be scary bro
Maybe because they expect Cam Thomas to be their next savior? That is what my family think.
holyshist 4 1st round picks LMFAOO
Kyrie kd harden all cry they way to nets and both cry they way out now instead them having stick through they all get what they want and kd gets to another put together team for semi easy push to finals
Woj literally said yesterday that the Nets had no intention of trading him, now he says they've been talks since last week 🙄🤔
Woj be on it. we kinda knew this was coming last because of him lol
Both these dudes are once again on a bus & not driving it lol. Dallas is Lukas team. Phoenix is Bookers team. What happened to creating their own legacies? 😂
I’m thinking of ja morant saying “we’re fine in the west.”   Grizzlies might be in for a rude awakening now 😂
Brooklyn is starting to look like the raptors, add a superstar to that team and they could really do something.
Ja Morant: I'm fine in the west  🤣
The Suns got FLEECED...jesus. Talk about giving up the farm. KD couldn't do it with Kyrie. Don't get too excited Phoenix.
KD Book CP3 Ayton 👀
Now the Ben Simmons is the face of the nets 😂😂😂😂
Good for KD…
Lol imagine if Kyrie and KD face each other in the playoffs. With the Suns Mavs rivalry as a backrop. Insane.
And the clouds opened up and said   "Iii hate you lebron' James"
NY can’t catch a break, finally had something going w the Nets and both of them left lol
Wild wild west omg😱
The fact they were able to keep Ayton.. Definitely top contenders now..
This is Wild smh
finally chris paul winning chammp hahaha
Wild wild west. 😎😎😎
If everyone stays healthy, this should be Chris Paul's first title.
I thought durant and kyrie  didn't need a coach to win a chipwhat happen🤦‍♂️😅
Checkmate Lakers 😂
Early morning east coast bruh it’s late night not early morning CUH
😳
😳😲😯
phoenix knew they couldn't take it to the next level. time to buy a chip.
Bye kyrie Irving and Durant
Brookyln Fans, how y'all doing?
The Brooklyn Nets Front Office is the WORST Front Office in NBA History
What if warriors get Joel E.???
The jazz got more for Gobert
The key to the suns winning it all is cp3 staying healthy in the playoffs.
Wow
Left ice cream Simmons by himself to be the franchise guy 🤭🤭🤭
Wow! Dallas vs Suns 2 🔥🔥
Joe Tsai should be arrested IMMEDIATELY
You can almost say nets ended up winning. Around 5 first round picks and an amazing group of young players,
Ok I smell a Mavs and Suns Playoff matchup
Poor LeGM, now he will be stuck with 4 Chips 🤭 now West is LOADED
Rockets get all 4 of those picks lol
Mikal, Johnson and 4 1st round pick excellent deal by the Nets. Time to move on from kd and kyrie, it didn't work. Nets wasn't going to win anyways. Rebuild and start over
Will Cp3 get a ring with kd 🤔? Like for yes comment for no
He’ll go on injury list and probably play after three games
I’ve never seen a day this crazy before the trade deadline!!
The Ben Simmons effect 😤😤
Yesssssss
Kyrie coming Paul out
Most blockbuster midseason trade since Carmelo Anthony
Lakers officially out of the playin, the West is stacked!
imagine nets still win the chip lol
Can’t believe it. As basketball fans, please make it suns vs mavs in the WCF. The world would explode
Svp brother should be fired trash media
West really competitive lebron a.d kyrie Luka kd booker cp3 d.ayton str8 🔥🔥🔥 who when's da West?🤔🤔
This match up will be even more heated now, can't wait for the playoffs   The East have it so easy now 😤
Imagine Ben casually shoots now and drops 35 a game
KD, Book, and CP3 on the same team? 🥶
WARRIORS about to get a taste of their Own Medicine
Congratulations Nets, back to irrelevancy now. 😁
west will win the chip now for sure
Lebron better go back to the East
Yoooo Wassgood phoniex ‼️‼️
The Thunder and Nets sure do know how too lose all their stars lmaoo
Poor lakers they thought they had a chance 🤣🤣
I wonder how Steve Nash is feeling about this right now! He gets fired coz of KD, Kyrie leave,Harden leaves...just craxy!!
Durant acting Iike LeBron now he can't lead his own team an he gotta go to a team already stack to win. 🤦🏿‍♂️
Kevin?
Robert Sarver is about to have a heart attack 💔
hes him
Suns have to trade ayton now
I'm genuinely shocked. I know there was rumors of him getting traded and Suns were on a small list of candidates but I never expected it to actually happen.   Ngl has there ever been a player on more Super duper stacked teams?  KD has to get a ring here .  Wow ...KD, Booker, CP3 , Ayton  That looks like a championship big 4 to me. At least he's not joining a 2 time mvp that won 73 games and a chip already. Perfect opportunity for ring number 3 and the first for the Suns franchise who have come so close several times in their  history.
How does masai lose out on this??
does KD ever brush his hair? my god them BB's
Nets are cursed just like the knicks. If healthy , the suns are favorite to win. East teams are not winning the finals
A lot of defense and depth gone, but still that big 4 of CP3, Book, Durant and Ayton is scary. Pretty top heavy team tho.
I hope chris Paul get his ring.
KD got Nash fired then bounced. Typical
Sir Charles told KD to go to the suns.
KD is 34. CP3 is 37. They have maybe 1.5 seasons to try to win.
Trade ayton????
west is stacked . gonna be a dogfight
Now lebron will go back to east 😂
I knew Kd wasn’t going to play for that owner after what they did to his best friend kyrie salute Kd for having your boy back💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Man imagine being lebron jaamees right now
Remacht Dallas vs Suns please 😍
Holy shits.. It finally happens..
Teammates turned Rivalries. Phx-Mavs Rivalry is gonna be 🔥🔥
PHX are favorites when KD is healthy!
Suns got fleeced
Trade deadline went crazy this year 😳
Ben Simmons punching air right now lol 😂
Biggest robbery of the decade

Ben Simmons about to retire 😂
Suns will be interesting in the playoffs
If they somehow dont get out of the west idek what they gotta do to win 💀

The Nets better build around Cam Thomas, Bridges, Claxton now
Durant is like Lebron going from team to team .

So the suns are the team to beat now? What about the nuggets
Omg they kept CP3  Booker and Ayton with KD yeah is over the super teams are back in affect

As a nets fan, I've never been so sad and shocked
Lol since kd ain’t request a trade before kyrie they sent him to his preferred destination lol
This week in the NBA has been crazy!!!!!!!!!
Suns ain’t f**cking around yall
The Western conference is ridiculously loaded now.   Meanwhile, it's all about the Celtics in the East.   This has been the craziest midseason trading that I've seen in a long time.
Might as well get rid of the east and west concept it’s not fair at this point 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Nooooo not mikal 😢
Man i don’t think this is the same western conference that ja morant said he’s fine in 😅
West gettin scary 4-5 prolly 6 teams can win it all
Where bridges go?
KD always gotta be on a superteam huh
Lmao kylie irving the drama queen set these events in motion 🤣

Joe Tsai is officially the dumbest owner in the history of team sports.
Suns are gonna be a problem in the west now!!! 🔥  CP3 Booker Warren KD Ayton  Unstoppable
Bro I'm just laughing at Ben Simmons now tbh 😂😂😂

Kevin Durant is such a clown bruh.  No loyalty.
VERY INTERESTING TRADE
