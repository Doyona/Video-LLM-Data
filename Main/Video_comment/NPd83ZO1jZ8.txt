What y’all think?
When you got no music talent so you “tribute” to a good song and make it worse.
This slaps
This is why NLE is better than Youngboy. NLE respects the old school and shows it some love. 🔥
damn this is some hot trash.  literally cannot think of a single reason why anyone would go ut of their way to listen to this over the original.  doesn't add anything new or modern, or anything interesting, and just executes everything the original did in a way sh*ttier way.  garbage.
Nice
❤
Oh yeah ❤
Big shit music and... (..)=> ..
Lil noonie + fullychop = 🗑️🤷🏽‍♂️
It's the charm of the girls already being dressed and striping down to a bra and jeans that made Nelly's so g so erotic
I’ve been waiting to shoot this.       For so long is my fav part

Who else isn't getting 7 years of bad luck?. 😅
ITS GETTIN HOT IN HERE 🔥
IVE BEEN WAITING TO SHOOT THIS 🫢 FO SO LONGGG🗣️🔥
(Verse 1) Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell, About a life full of struggles, but I never fell, From the streets to the mic, I'm here to excel, I'm spitting fire, watch me cast my spell.  I grew up in the hood, where dreams were shattered, But I never let it define me, I always mattered, I hustled hard, grinding day and night, Chasing my dreams, ready to take flight.  (Chorus) I'm on the rise, can't be denied, I'm breaking through, reaching for the sky, No matter the obstacles, I won't be shy, I'm making moves, watch me amplify.  (Verse 2) I've faced adversity, but I never backed down, I turned my pain into lyrics, making heads spin 'round, I'm the voice of the voiceless, speaking for the streets, My rhymes hit hard, knocking out all the beats.  I've seen the struggle, the poverty and pain, But I'm here to inspire, to break the chain, I'm spitting truth, exposing the lies, Using my words to open up closed eyes.  (Chorus) I'm on the rise, can't be denied, I'm breaking through, reaching for the sky, No matter the obstacles, I won't be shy, I'm making moves, watch me amplify.  (Verse 3) I'm a lyrical genius, my flow is insane, I paint pictures with words, leaving minds blown in the rain, I'm the voice of the underdogs, the ones who fight, I'm here to uplift, to shine a light.  I'm breaking barriers, breaking stereotypes, Using my platform to ignite the fire, I'm a force to be reckoned with, a rising star, I'm leaving my mark, no matter who you are.  (Chorus) I'm on the rise, can't be denied, I'm breaking through, reaching for the sky, No matter the obstacles, I won't be shy, I'm making moves, watch me amplify.  (Bridge) This rap game is my passion, my escape, I'm here to make a difference, no time to wait, I'll keep grinding, keep pushing through, Because success is mine, and I know it's true.  (Chorus) I'm on the rise, can't be denied, I'm breaking through, reaching for the sky, No matter the obstacles, I won't be shy, I'm

Nelly had badder girls in his videos
WWWWW
So you're making money by copying other people. Sorry bro. But that's not talent. Try making your name.  It's a dislike for me.
I saw that disgusting butt and lost my lunch. Thanks.
I'm SO tired of people saying that NLE Choppa is gay. He is not! He's bisexual. I went to one of his shows in Maryland and afterwards he invited me on his bus. He let me go down on him but he was getting with girls too. I asked if he eould return the favor and he laughed and had me get off the bus about 15 minutes later. I still think he's a cool guy though.
if u say nle fast it sounds like nelly so perfect person to do this
WE GETTING THE N-WORD PASS WITH THIS ONE 🗣 🔥🔥🔥🔥👴🏻💯

Choppa is the correct name for somebody that bites off other rappers' creative works. It's comical how he tried to look and sound like Nelly. I think he is a fan of Nelly too. Just not as cute and sweet as Nelly. Nelly has this sweet bad-boy charm and affection as depicted in the song video he did with Terry Rowland. Nelly's songs are more hip-hop and lyrical and incomparable to rap.
Choppa's video compared to Nelly's was alright just not as hott. Nelly, is hott and makes me wanna take my clothes off. 😘🥰Choppa's version sounded like rap and not the hip-hop sound of Nelly.🤔🤔🤔
Thank you for the heart, I love you ❤️ 😅
1:23 me and my friend like this part
Come on shake that monkey
It was my birthday when nle drop this

How do you make a tribute to a song made before you were even born? And some songs just need to be left alone… you took a fun, classic, catchy song everyone knows and made it a nasty, annoying and unbearable disaster..
Nelly literally made this song when he was 8
Bruh only 2.5 ppl saw this? Bro this needs to get way populair

I came here because of the JBP and appreciate you paying tribute to an older artist.  That connection between the younger artist and those came before is what is needed more in hip-hop and I hope more will follow suit.

meh seems lazy, coulda been done  better smh
This shit big 🗑️
Here before 1m
Trash!!!! Leave classics alone
It’s hard to decide which is better original or this
Einfach Shirin David im Video
B. E. T 106 and park Aj&Free😢 dem dayz
I'm just confused as to what this is lol like are we rebooting songs now too not just movies?
The girl singing the hook has a really nice voice.  Not bad for a lil tribute and better than Ice gave you credit for
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
This song is fire 🔥🔥🔥
This shit is good nle choppa
I fucks with NLE but this trash bro
I disliked the original one, this one is far worse.. the world could have done eithout this mess
Best song of the year
Ayyyy this fire❤🔥
I love the fact u added 2010 style in it a bit love it keep it up
This joint trash. Nelly only sung the chorus/hook. Doing this for the whole song is od. And he had another songs to support his melodic attempts. If this the only song from NLE doing this….gotta fine tune but big ups to giving flowers. He is a young artist that does that so good for that.
not nle without women twerking tbh
It’s crazy that videos like this is accepted and everyone thinks it’s a banger, but when Jason Aldean try that in a small town, everyone gets offended like this whole world is filled with snowflakes 😂😂😂
Half tribute, half spoof.
This is cringe
People been saying he looked like Nelly for so many years, this just makes sense 😊❤
❤Legendary remake, booty cheeks and bullet 🕳️s 🥴
💩
I ALWAYS said he looked like Nelly His mouth, is very scorpio, like nelly 🦂♏ He could be Nelly 's son 😮
❤❤❤❤
Uh idk..it's ok but pass, that's a damn classic
1:39 дизлайк за эту хуйню
Love it 🔥. He has his own lane and he does it well. Club vibe. It’s fun, you can dance to it and have a good time. I’m here for it.
🔥🔥🔥
This shit looks like he's making fun of Nelly
Love that someones finally givin Nelly his flowers. OG Melodic rapper and IMO his style is how melodic rap should sound like.
Sounds like one of those kids bop remakes 😂😂 TRASH
I love the song
i love this, nle not like others rappers that do soul selling shi, he got different varieties of rap styles , so pure i love it
Need to hear this at beach please next year

🚨⏰🗣️Ma thew 4:17 From that time je sus began to pre ach, and to say, Re pent: for the kingdom of he aven is at hand. Lu ke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be bap tized by him, “Br ood of vi pers! Who warned you to flee from the wra th to come?

There’s a few comments saying he ruined the song , or that he’s taking the song , I mean you can think that, but pretty sure not only did he bring the song back a bit but he did it purely because he loves the song and is a nelly fan , what artist wouldn’t want to hop on a track that they grew up on?
But still sounds good though 😊
He copied Nelly in hot in herre😢😢😮😮
Hard asf 🔥🔥

Hot ❤😂🎉
This shit is doodoo 💩
Nle has never had a bad song ever
This fire and different
F***
NLE is the best Rapper out there
Do lil Wayne next. Lollipop
Fact: that's where he took his stage name
At least my guy Nelly just got paid cus this ain't a good jawn
When I first seen Grapin, tribute to 2Pac I grew a different Respect for NLE, but this here took the cake 🔥🔥🔥🔥 is going make the new generation go back to Nelly, & he bout to make Nelly some of this new $$, do I smell a remix ft Nelly 🎯💯
This shit is trash
It’s cool 7/10 popcorns 😂
I fucks with NLE young brotha creative fr fr.. I like the Tupac tribute 1 to ..
Let's hope he don't get sued cause Mfers be petty
🔥🔥🔥
Choppa ❤
Literally like in 90s its cool
Damn 😂 shit tight
Why this lowkey wholesome even with the shawtys shaking they cans lmfao
Imma keep it a buck bro I ain’t a massive fan of urs but this is some heat definitely gonna give more of ur future songs a listen

Damn nigga this shit fucking good but go back to the past NLE Choppa started rapping at 15 or 16 damn CHOPPA you fucking good try to live forever hope you become a dad again
Tell me if i am wrong but at about 1:03 or 1:04 it doesn't look like choppa getting head. I mean come on he is lucky to get that shit in a music video even last time with first day out also known as beatbox freestyle like choppa the only one to be able to get away with it
THIS SHITTTT FIREEEEEE
С кайфом тречок брат🫱🏼‍🫲🏿🔥

These young artists can't come up with NOTHING new. Everything a sample
And wash ass rappers will say mumble rap this, and hate hate etc. No, this is what it means to be a musician, the creativity, the genius, the execution, I’m not sure I can articulate how much I appreciate this piece.   Thanks Chop, truly Legendary. ❤
I wasn't a Nelly fan however I can't deny the hold he had. Anyway this is better than the original
banger
👽💚💚💚
Nle needs 2 regularly wear a 2XL tall shirt and baggy jeans

I miss the nle of shotta flow, final warning, camelot, beat box 4, l.y.b, etc. I know they have to innovate but... although this is not bad anyway. if I have bad English it's because I wrote this about the translator lol
Lesss go Choppa!

This shit on repeat!
Could you do a part 2 for nle choppa fits
He looks like Nelly though.
Hot in hurrr
Who’s in the thumbnail
I remember back in the day when the original to this song came out. It didn't matter what race or religion or age you were. If a person pulled up playing this song, everybody started dancing it didn't matter who it was. 😂 Or in school, if somebody's parent came to pick them up, playing this song with some fresh spinners cutting the air even even the teachers would start dancing. 😂 Man what a Way more simple year. I hate what everything has become.
Good video bro💥💯
Og’s Only Like This Comment💜🔥

this song reminds me to old school songs
HARD
i been waiting to shoot this 🤫 for so long 🔥

Yo choppa huge fan trying to make a song with you cuz
@NLECHOPPA - If you love God, then please stop promoting whoredom among His people.   This is how we get single mothers and deadbeat fathers.  I challenge you to make a song about how God has helped you and your people in your life.  “For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.” -Hosea 4:10  Please consider this. ✊🏾

Excuse my lack of terminology, but the  song is good, the video is good, the only thing is, the voice sounds too singular, Nelly voice had a over dub on it. You should redo the audio and over dub your voice, then it would be perfect. I still injoy yoour tributes .

What’s up with all the classics getting remade? Like the entire blueprint is taken without really changing anything at all from the original. Why? It’s not even good, who’s lying to these artists?
Shirin David??
Slid on this jawn fasho!!!!
I feel like you could’ve done a LOT better.. I love you but this tribute is 🗑️
This shit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hope u see this comment mane I was on yo live when u said this hit came out love ur music mane it’s always been a dream to meet you even tho im only 12
regarding all of Stl ts is ass
Personally I feel like if Tory Remixed this it would go harder
NLE are you dropping a new song with lil Durk and DD Osama
chop take over
NOT BETTER THAN NELLY'S HIT
🔥🔥🔥
NELLY IS UNDERRATED and when people speak of the GOATS NELLT BEEDS TO BE IN THE. CONVERSATION he is over looked and not talked about enough he had his own lane has his own type of music and it was the hottest out for years he has legendary songs no one has been close or has been anything like Nelly since and  NEVER WILL give Nelly the recognition he deserves ! Nelly is top 10 no question
Nle https://youtu.be/AFDAb_iaceQ
This sht garbage 😂😂😂😂
Nah gotta stop it’s Nelly don’t be taken his shit
I understand he having fun with his music but this all over the place I don’t like this one

I mean it’s straight but it’s not great. Why can’t these new artists make their OWN hits without remaking 90’s to early 00’s?

最近のコムドットについてどう思いますか？
NLE CHOPPIN' HERE !!! AYEEEEEEEEEE
its a no for me sorry .
As a lover for NLE and for Nelly, Obvious both come from 2000 eroa and nle comes from 2020 era, I feel like his record lable to causing NLE to push out content whether its good or not. This tribute should of just been left to nelly or someone on those same voal chord capabilities that hes musical tone is one. Dont get me wrong, you have some good songs NLE, but it seems the more frequent you release this songs and the faser it seems for you to push out a music video, you can tell your being overworked and basically being a puppet for the industry at this point. DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. BRING back the old NLE.  like "moonlight; and songs from around that Era. Don't let these record lables put a damper on the quality of music you can make,  My afvice a a true fan whose fiance' is a well known artist, you want quality not over quantity; same kind of concept when dealing w3333D. You want the best product but you cant get the best product when you're settling for smaller sized bud or buds with quantity not QUALITY buds. Same with your music in the industry. people want QUALITY music not a quantity amount of music that all ounds the same, You're a talented dude, You can do this and get it back if you put your mind it it,
Tupac nelly who nxt cuz on god this shit lit
I love how you remade the “ it’s getting hot In here” lol😅
