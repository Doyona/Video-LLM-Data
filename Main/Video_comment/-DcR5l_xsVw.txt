U know how strong Man City is when u can even predict they can win a treble at the start of the season
He got 88 Points
"I dont think aston villa will get top 10" literally people always underestimate avl
Chelsea 2nd was an incredibly awful shout 😂😂
Well this aged well
Please collab with my Boi Bfordlancer
Love it
Hooked on your videos Ben! Just such great positive vibes, Would love to eventually meet you one day, huge idol of mine! Keep up the awesome videos, best wishes from Australia
Agreed!!
Where you shocked about ex team mates Sarrs goal from in his half
Hello
“Make the weirdest face you can”
Why play music behind you speaking
Absolutely loving the content. Wish you were joining Leeds!
Stop dis respecting Arsenal. We are up for top 4
Sssssuuuuiiii
I liked this video.
I’m a Newcastle fan and I speak for every other fan we don’t expect top 4 or Europe finishing 10th would do us trust the process and the owners Rome wasn’t built in a day but Newcastle has woken back up ⚫️⚪️
Ben foster a Arsenal player now?!?!
Arsenal in the top 3 this season
I hope that Watford make it back to the premier league
JOIN HASHTAG UNITED! 💛🔵
That Arsenal shirt has blinded you bro. Tottenham will 100% finish above Chelsea
Come on the boys!
Loving the vids!
Mr foster would be great tv analyst for epl
One of the most realistic and accurate predictions I’ve seen for this season!
Did you not learn anything about underestimating Liverpool? Probably tired of getting scored on by them lol
My Premier League 22/23 prediction as of August 5th at 7:48am  1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham 4. Arsenal -------------------------------- 5. Chelsea 6. Man Utd -------------------------------- 7. West Ham 8. Newcastle 9. Leicester 10. Aston Villa  11. Wolves 12. Brighton 13. Nottingham Forest  14. Crystal Palace  15. Brentford  16. Everton  17. Southampton  --------------------------------- 18. Fulham 19. Leeds United 20. Bournemouth
The sound when the logo of the teams is incredibly loud, maybe tune it down just a little bit.
Chelsea in 2nd is a big L Liverpool will easily come second or even first
the Leicster game was 1-5
You’ve done so well to jump on YouTube and find a gap in the market for football v YouTube content. Even if we don’t see you in the prem again, I’ll defo be a CGK fan for life. 🙏🏻
Them nike balls looking real nice Ben great vid
UP THE CHEZ 🍒🍒🍒
Chelsea second no chance my top 4  Liverpool  Man city  Arsenal  Tottenham
Can I have the ball
Ben foster sign for Rangers would love to see them behind the scenes training and it would even better with you
Has Ben got a FPL league going?
Shambles.
Hopefully Watford will be back in the Prem next season! Love your channel, keep going :)
⚽️ Do you expect the new 5 subs rule to make much of a difference? ⚽️
It’s a shame we won’t see you in the prem this season but I’m sure you’ll smash it in the championship and I’m sure we’ll all be supporting you!! Can’t wait to see what Watford get up to :)
🤩
Friggin legend
Liverpool will finish first easily. Unless city signs an actual good LB who can defend
Not sure about some of your predictions. Chelsea wont finish in top 4. Leicester will finish in bottom half and Leeds for the drop would be my main differences. My crazies? Arsenal 2nd, Man C 3rd and Pool winners with Spurs 4th spot. Palace top half. Newcastle 7th, Utd 6th and Chelsea 5th
Ben Foster wants a coaching job at Arsenal
Wolves ay we your an absolute Legend Ben even tho you played for the Albion and blues still a class block but what about neves goal against you 😉
Thankfully Liverpool came up first so I could hear the crap Ben spewed and turn over without bothering with the rest of the video. I can’t believe an actual professional talks such nonsense. 18 points clear or 3rd last season. Utter tosh.
Absolutely love the laidback content lads! Quick Tip for the editor, switch up the background music. Up the cherries though! Ben is talking nonsense with last place.
If/When Schmeichel leaves Leicester, I hope they at least consider the Cycling GK  But Chelsea ain't finishing above Liverpool/Spurs or even Arsenal. Not with the current squad that they have. Starting CB partnership being 31+, poor defensive cover (especially if/when Alonso and Azpilicueta leave as they reportedly desire), lack of a proper No.9 that can rival Haaland, Nunez, Kane, and now Jesus. (And no, while Sterling has scored plenty over his time at City, it is City we are talking about, where they create chances for fun so Miss Universe can afford to miss a bunch and still score.) That said, things will definitely change if they get Fofana and maybe Dumfries over the line.
Leeds relegated this season
How is it as a free agent?
Newcastle going to be having a big season coming up
Create a fantasy league craving to join.
🐐of
I know a lot of people want to hate on Ben because they think YouTube distracts him from the prem but I love the content
Whats the FPL league code
Not bad predictions prefer it to last years
Chelsea 2nd????
Good luck bro
You doing fantasy premier leauge  leauge this season or no??
I feel like that bottom 10 can always change that’s the most beautiful thing about Football.
Wben was this recorded? Forest have spent more than any other club 😂
If kepa is sold, come to chelsea
Go to Leeds ben

Wore an Arsenal shirt but not Arsenal badge on thumbnail...
Why are you wearing a Asscumnal shirt?
Really hope you sign for a premier league club. Especially my team leeds, but any other team would be lucky to have you. It would be a massive loss not having you in the league next year. Whatever you decide, good luck.
Would love to win a premier league ball, been following a while and getting my nephew into premier league so would love to give him this(especially sighed by you BF1)
fpl code?
You weren’t wrong about Liverpool mind.. they did die off a little bit at the start of the season but just came back incredibly strong after Christmas
Loved your predictions mate! Although I personally believe Manchester United will just nick the champions league position

I’m an arsenal fan and that shirt is horrendous
When are you signing for us Ben? Hope you do Young Messlier needs a good mentor 😃👍
Hopefully ur right with chelsea predictions as im not feeling optimistic for season currently 🤞
Brilliant as usual Ben!
Great content as always Ben!
Chelsea second right now can't happen with them losing players left and right and I think arsenal will get the above spurs easy
NEED THIS BALL
Good on ya Ben, great set of selections! I'd love me a chance at those premier league balls so I can train with them down here in NZ.
done
come to Beşiktaş
I think I agree with almost all of these predictions! Maybe Nottingham a little higher, and Leicester a little lower
Liked and commented!
That's what I like about the premier league, it's so unpredictable and there will always guaranteed be 1 or 2 teams that will shock everyone one way or another such as Everton last season or West ham the season before.
We're spending 😂🔴⚪🌳
I entered the football competition, brilliant predictions other than the Liverpool one in my opinion we are in for a shout as it’s our first full season with Diaz, and I’m positive Nunez will also impress.
Bournemouth Southampton Everton down. Fulham Forrest Brentford Brighton Wolves bottom half. Palace Leeds Newcastle Leicester mid. Villa West Ham Chelsea close to 6th place. Arsenal-5 , United-4, Spurs-3.
This video may be abit premature with forest spending over 70 mil and still potentially 5 more signings COYR ❤️🎉 love the content Ben Foster absolute top bloke keep it coming
Villa finishing top 10 this season 💯
Hi guys. Can you watch the mix between the vocals and music? Vocals too quiet and music too loud. Crapped myself every time you cut to a teams badge 😂😂😂
Boy I want this ball!!
Bro said Liverpool will finish 3rd? 😱😱
Good predictions.
Love you Ben, great prediction as always and ill miss you in the prem! Thanks for backing my boys chelsea
Forest have spent big?? Forest will be potentially top 10 of the players gel. But yeah I understand the skepticism
Our forster is wearing united rival kit
Yoh
Its kinda good that everyone predicting Arsenal to miss out on the UCL again which is not gonna be acceptable for Arsenal. Now they can focus on their job. But i still think we can surprise a lot of people this season.
Hi Ben mate do you have an fpl league this season or not
Yesss
Ayyyy
Chelsea Champions surely! Sterling top scorer in the PL, you Heard it here first. Now gimme one of them magnificent balls you friggin legend 🙏
2030 Premier league winners Man City
You've got no ball knowledge.
M9ooooooooo
Hope to see you get a Prem League offer mate, been really liking your channel. looks like quite a decent prediction. and even though i kinda agree. i hope Man U. gets top 4 😪
Think your predictions are pretty bang on. Good vid Ben! good luck next season
Beautiful footballs
Mate the bpl balls are very very very very ugly😂😂😂
I can see palace having a good season.They have a good crop of both exciting young ,players,(olise,eze,mitchell,guehi)combined with som more experienced pros like zaha.Doucore looks a good signing,as does the young lad from bayern munich.I can see them getting 8th ot 9th maybe.
As a chelsea fan I can't see us finishing above Liverpool and think we could struggle to finish above spurs but I hope you're right Ben
Great video mate, although I have to disagree with the forest  prediction.  I reckon they'll survive and come 16th/17th.  All your other predictions were near enough spot on
Would love one of those premier league balls
The new premier league football is a banger
My prediction  1. Man City  2. Tottenham 3.Liverpool 4. Arsenal 5. Chelsea 6. Newcastle 7. Man Utd 8. West Ham 9. Leicester 10. Crystal Palace 11. Wolves 12.Brighton 13. Nottingham Forest 14. Aston Villa 15. I Leeds 16. Bournemouth 17. Southampton 18.Everton 19. Brentford 20.Fulham
Spurs are winning the league
Ever thought about being a BBC pundit for football focus Ben Foster
Again, Liverpool being disrespected
Love the podcast absolute Quality 💯
Giver away
I feel like you had some good predictions. Great video Ben and hopefully Man United can get champions league but that’ll be a task.
I feel like you had some good predictions. Great video Ben and hopefully Man United can get champions league but that’ll be a task.
it will be more teams going for the league unlike last year will be interesting.
Interesting video!
Chelsea too high
It would have been awkward to do premier league predictions with Watford in it :P
great vid bro
Oooohhhhh scammers lol
Hope leeds picks you up would love to see you in prem playing still. Would probably make Simon happy
I may or may not have a soft spot for Leeds all of a sudden, if the rumours play out! Just sayin!
Villa are getting 8th
I thought Ben played for SH at some point in his career
Ben clearly does not follow football forest have spent loads
I think 1st-City 2nd-Liverpool 3rd-Tottenham 4th-Arsenal 5th-Chelsea 6th-Man U 7th-West ham 8th-Wolves 9th-Leicester  10th-Newcastle 11th-Crystal palace 12th-Brighton 13th-Notm Forrest 14th-Brentford 15th-Southampton  16th-Aston Villa 17th-Fulham 18th-Everton 19th-Leeds 20th-Bournemouth
beg i win a ball
Hi Ben I'm a Chelsea fan and just wondering when you predicted us 2nd what signings do we think we need to make that happen? Also I'd love one of the balls 😂
Spot on predictions there lad
Of Chelsea don’t get their signings, that second spot is surely Liverpool’s and they are likely to battle for that 4th spot. Barca did us bad.  I’m rooting for Forest though
NO CHANCE SOUTHAMPTON GET RELEGATED !
Up the cherries
Hope you find a club soon.. good episode..
Everton 14th 😂😂😂😂
Quality vid 👌👌
Please can I have the ball ⚡️
Buzzing for the new season!
i think arsenal will suprise alot of people this year. they are definitely the underdog. man city clear favourites
Love you Ben x
Top ten finish for NUFC...id take your arm off for that right now.... TOON TOON!
I completely agree with the whole table of predictions apart from the top 6, which I’ll put bellow this, however if I’m right u gotta let me be in one of ur videos ;)   Man City  Tottenham  Liverpool  Arsenal  Chelsea Man U
COYS
Nice video Ben👍
Up the boys
If cristiano stays its COOKING , if not you are correct mate.
21 is coming
my prediction : 1. ManCity  2. Liverpool 3. Spurs  4. Arsenal  5. West Ham  6. ManUtd  7. NewCastle 8. Chelsea   I think ManCity and Liverpool will still battle it out for the title, Spurs seems to be really solid this year under Conte so I predict them finishing 3rd with Arsenal 4th (BARELY), then followed by West Ham and ManUtd who also barely finishes 6th (could be lower thou), NewCastle at 7th and Chelsea 8th.   Chelsea seems like a shamble, the usual 2nd season syndrome where they had a fallout in the dressing room, players rebelling against their manager, and then sacked and finishes outside of top-6.
Chelsea above Spurs? after this transfer window and with their current managers? For a pro, that is a weird take on things 😂
What a video i compared it to mine and it was very similar (wouldnt mind a ball aswell😂)
Pretty much agree tbh
Ben Foster is a turncoat. 21 is coming 😅
football
Enjoyed the vid, was hoping for arsenal top 4 as I don't think Chelsea will do as well as you do.
Done
Hi
Forest will stay up
Chelsea 2nd? They'll finish outside top 4.
I really hope you get to join arsenal. I think you will add value to the GK unit in so many ways.
Your manc’ness is showing Ben…. Liverpool first or worst case 2nd
I feel like the main the reason city didn’t win the cl was because of the striker role, great win Ben
cool
So many people here making big assumptions just by watching some FRIENDLY games. Chill guys
We want you at Bournemouth this year big man!!
Really excited for the season, anything could happen!
Why you wearing arsenal kit🤔
UP THE CHERRIES
Seriously did you not see Liverpool last season now your putting them 3rd are you okay?
Those balls look insanse
i saw this tiktok prediction and he said leeds at second lol imagine
1st - City 2nd - Liverpool 3rd - Spurs 4th - Arsenal 5th - Chelsea
Nice vid!
Man city again 😃 Those prem balls look sick
You signing for Arsenal when Leno goes?
I know you probably won’t see this but here are my predictions. Note that I’m a city and Cardiff fan.  1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham  4. Chelsea  5. Man United  6. Arsenal  7. West Ham 8. Newcastle 9. Brighton 10. Crystal Palace 11. Leicester 12. Wolves 13. Everton 14. Brentford 15. 16. Fulham 17. Leeds 18. Southampton  19. Bournemouth  20. Nottingham Forrest   Had no clue with forest I’m only 14 so I have no clue bout Forrest’ history and stuff so I just stuck them there.  Also, Haaland has his past with injuries, but hopefully not this one coming up so I’m hoping for 20+.  Also I really enjoyed watching your prediction and to prove that I’m loyal lol I just finsished the 31 minute vid at 3 in the morning 😂😂😂😂
Class predictons Ben lad, although I’ve got spurs coming second ❤️
Forest are going to stay up! weve strengthened our side! YOOUUUU REDS
My Prem Prediction:  👑//Liverpool 🔵//Man City  🔵//Arsenal  🔵//Spurs  🟠//Chelsea  🟠//Man United  🟢//West Ham  8//Wolves  9//Aston Villa 10//Leicester  11//Crystal palace  12//Newcastle  13//Brighton 14//Fulham  15//Everton  16//Southampton  17//Leeds  🔴//Brentford 🔴//Forrest 🔴//Bournemouth
I feel like Darwin Nunez is gonna flop, I hope I'm wrong because he was amazing for Benfica but the Premier League is different gravy.
My prediction 1) Man City (Champions League Finalist) 2) Liverpool (Champions League Winner) 3) Arsenal (League Cup Winners)  4) Chelsea 5) Man Utd 6) West Ham 7) Tottenham 8) Leicester (FA Cup Winners)  9) Newcastle 10) Southampton The rest will be a gamble to guess but yh someone screenshot this and watch how in right
Ben if you need a new club please come to Stoke
The top 6 and bottom 6 looks so difficult this season bottom 6 could swap around in any order and top 6 except maybe liverpool and city can say they all look to have improved but who can settle the quickest with all the new signings
Here for the balls 😂
an exciting season ahead & its Man City who will be champs again , Arsenal excite me with Jesus up front for them , Liverpool will be close & excited by their new signing Darwin
i want a ball
Please I really need a new ball all mine are flat and it is time for a new ball, design is amazing and would love to have it
Looks decent. Call me bias but backing united to get top 4
Leeds will be fine! Nice boring season mid table 🤍💛💙 We will finish above  Brentford and Everton!!! Leicester and Wolves will struggle! ALAW MOT
Shame Ben didn’t wait a week to make this video to see Forest now😂
@gracexwoolley #YNWA ❤️
I think wolves will get 8th
Spurs win league 🫡 lol
I think Arsenal will be handy this year. But with Europa League that may make it difficult for top 4. Chelsea and Man U, hard to predict how they will do.
Championship table predictions?
the problem abt ronaldo isnt that hes bad its that his ego is too big and with bruno, pogba, rashford, greenwood ect all in that team last year they just werent gunna gel well enough
Decent predictions mate🙂
Nice
Good luck finding a club Fozzie!! Leeds stay up, city take the title
Couple of seasons behind wolves 😂 wolves be lucky to stay up 😂
Yes ben
Chelsea to finish 5th, liverpool to finish 1st
Yeah West Ham got to the semis 😂
ditch the shite background music ben
your fifa card is so bad, please retire so you are never in fifa again
love the content lad! imma always support the gunners but it looks like man u could do really well this season. this ball looks so nice, love to get my hands on it
West Ham lost in the semifinals so they didn’t get to the final
With the money that Forest have spent, I think they've got a fighting chance! It's also a shame if you don't sign for a Prem club again!
I am hoping you find a club for the new season! If not I would love to see you on Sky Sports!
Love ben but it is quite funny how people write liverpool off every year without fail. Not saying we win it but across the last 4 years we have a single point difference with city. With that and the fact crucial players   like robertson, diaz and salah will actually get a christmas break from the world cup and actually be fresh. To not say top 2 seems wild to me
🐐
Shame your not in the prem this season  I’m a United fan and always thought you were a underrated keeper for us
Man utd are 2
Ben keeps making the mistake of underestimating liverpool
Chelsea second ??💀💀
United will get in ucl
Great video
I'm hoping the cherries will prove your prediction wrong 😂⚽🍒
Chelsea desperately need to bulk out their squad, else I can't see how they can finish in the top 4. Obviously this video was shot before the Arsenal Chelsea preseason game - but with knowledge of that game, Chelsea were extremely laboured and really struggled against a very sharp Arsenal. Think they might struggle. I'd put them 6th I think.
Give me the ball. I will cycle to you if i have to
Great video legend enjoy your content makes my day you are a star
I’ve liked and subscribed and I need a football because I only get to play at school because I have no footballs at home so I need it really bad and thank you for the content and thank you if I get the football
Is Ben doing fantasy football again this year
As a Newcastle I'd be MORE than happy with a top 10 finish!!
Hi ben
I might think that united will finish a bit higher 🙃
Great vid Ben like always and if possible could I please get a shoutout 🙂🙂🙂
Why does it go so loud for a couple seconds after you pull a team out 😂
Don’t follow the reasoning putting cfc ahead of lfc
No chance Chelsea finish 2nd
I went for the exact same bottom 4 so agree
1 chelsea
Personally I think haaland will struggle first season maybe 15 goals then next season 30+
Great video hopefully Chelsea do have the season you predicted!
Wolves are great I’m a fan but they should be 6th and be higher than arsenal and spurs I like Chelsea too
Ben pulls a team out the hat "oh, that's interesting!" 😂
Can’t wait for the season
surely brighton can't go into another season without a top striker. if cucurella leaves, with bissouma gone, brighton look set to take a step back unless they can wisely invest some of that money. i thought they should have targeted scamacca but seems like he's headed to west ham.
Pls Ben I rlly need one
love the content, and shame that Watford is in the championsship
No way Chelsea is coming second. Also I think forest is going to do a Brentford/ Sheffield utd first season and stay up comfortably
chelsea will defo not finish 2nd after losing players and having bad form in pre season... i think man utd 3rd chelsea 5th tottenham 4th 2nd liverpool 1st man city
Big boys, Man United 😂 they shouldn’t be put in the same sentence any more
Let’s go ✅
hashtag soon ? 🤔
Come to leeds
Belter listen on the Ride! 🚴🏼
Less go
Big Noob alert 🚨
🙌🙌🙌
Two things I’m sure of. Arsenal top 4 (I think 3rd) and Everton getting relegated.
Just saying West Ham didn't get to the Europa League final?
Love from Belgium
Ben will u join hashtag as u said?
class video lads!
Great content as usual. Hope to see you in the premier league this year as still a top goalkeeper.
In hindsight Ben and that Wolves dude didnt get the last couple of results especially Gunners-Chelsea. One game I get it, but the whole pre-season so far has been a big mess for Chelsea. The competitiveness of the PL will be so unforgiving that unless Chelsea find out smth really clever really quick they will be nowhere near the nr 2 spot. You simply cant afford 5 bad games as a starter against not only City but also Pool and arguably Spurs and Gunners as well. Atm Chelsea will struggle big time finishing in top 6 unless TT can do some miracles the last 10 days or so
My top 10: 1.Manchester City 2.Liverpool 3.Tottenham 4.Chelsea 5.Manchester United 6.Arsenal 7.Leicester  8.West Ham 9.Newcastle United 10.Brighton (or Wolves)
I think these predictions are pretty spot on tbh 👏🏻 This ball would fit perfectly in my prem ball collection! I’ve been collecting since the covid season and also have the 06/07, 10/11 and Euro final ball 🔥
Chelsea 2nd when they’ve lost a load of players and could lose more whilst struggling to sign anyone is a very bold call, think they’ll do well to get top 4
Chelsea finishing above Liverpool is hilarious
Mup the foster fella
You'll be wrong about Leeds, watch it
I feel like arsenal will get top 4
I agree with most except chelsea, i think chelsea is gonna finish 5th
I really think Brentford will be fighting relegation without Eriksen
My prediction is  1 Man City   2 Liverpool   3 Chelsea   4 Spurs   5 Arsenal   6 Newcastle   7 man united   8 West Ham   9 Leister   10 Aston Villa  11 Crystal Palace   12 Brighton   13 Nottingham Forest   14 Wolves   15 Southampton   16 Leeds United   17 Everton   18 Brentford   19 Fulham  20 Bournemouth   What’s your v v                      v v
My top 6 1 Citteh 2 VarPewl  3 Arse  4 Spuds 5 Chelshit 6 Manushited
how are people underestimating liverpool again. they gonna fuck up chelsea lol
I feel like arsenal are gonna be top 4
As a Chelsea fan i Don’t think 2 place is happening
Future pundit🤣🤣👌
arsenal 3rd
No way said saints are gonna be relagated 😂😂
Is saints a joke to you ?
Forest will do better imo
Chelsea aren't finishing 2nd🤣
You’ve got no idea spurs 4, Liverpool 3 justification for both of these is so far off it’s untrue. 😂 😂
Chelsea 2nd ahahahahaha good joke fozzy
Fulham will be first. I will win the ball.  Guess which of these sentences are true?
Done Arsenal dirty not putting them in the thumbnail 🤣
I agree, but I would switch places for Tottenham and Man United and Nottingham Forest and Leeds
Would love to see you back at the Albion, had very good seasons with us
Hope you find a club
What do you mean Leeds don't have "premier league players" had messi ever been a premier league player was aguero was kante a premier league player from the beginning you have to start from somewhere if you buy premier league players it's just 35 mil at a time honestly how can a footballer just sit there and agree honestly woke
Bournemouth will 100% survive and Liverpool will finish 2nd at least
United won 4-0 against Liverpool and they are in 6th place in the leaderboard  That leaderboard is Cap 🧢🧢🧢🧢
No way arsenal finish above Utd
Would love the ball for a goals session
There's always a joker in the pack and I think it will be Man U this year. I can see them top 3.
Bin the background music off for the love of God
Are u coming back to West brom we need to know
It's abit early isn't it Ben? We've still got a full month of transfer window left
7 Newcastle  6 Man United 5 Spurs 4 Chelsea 3 Arsenal 2 Liverpool 1 Man City   18 Leeds 19 Fulham 20 Bournemouth
Would love a ball for my collection Ben! Might end up kicking it round the back garden it looks that nice!
How ben sees chelsea in top 4 is a mystery
Love the content foz!  keep it up
I wish you were Arsenals 2nd keeper. You and Ramsdale would be the most entertaining dressing room in the Prem.
Poor Foster...Good GK bad predictor...
Forest 19th?!
Great video Ben. Will be waiting to see what is next for your football career!!!
Nice video
🇨🇦
Love this video a lot. can’t imagine the PL is without you, hope to see you sign with the team.  As a Chelsea fan, but I think Chelsea will lower than Arsenal, based on the pre-season performance.  P.S. the vlog of last season’s final game against Chelsea has yet to come out, can’t wait to watch. 😉
.
Ben can ya pls come back to West Brom 🙏🏻
I just can't see  Spurs nor Chelsea higher up than Arsenal. I think Arteta and Arsenal will shine this year and get to 3rd position. City Pool Arsenal.
Liverpool will be 1st or 2nd without a doubt. Last season, Liverpool are often underrated in predictions. Klopp points total 99,97,92 = 1 PL. Fergie - never got above 91 = 13 PL => Football isn't a fair game.
I think we'll see Chelsea drop out of the top 4 this season
Bmouth (20), Leeds, forest, Fulham, Palace, Shampton, villa, Bford. My bottom 8. Top 6 as usual. We do need a Premier league story to keep this season interesting so,  Out of Everton (12), Brighton, wolves, Wham, Lester, Newcastle 7th & Eddie 'However' to keep neutrals rooting.
Man needs to sign with arsenal Turn ramsdale into a beast
I love his reasonings and explanations city are going to be a force to be reconned with. Lol
Solid predictions, Man United and arsenal have had a solid pre season so far so may upset the apple cart!
Why's he wearing an arsenal shirt?
Darwin Nunez will score more than haarland this season. Bet your wife on it
Chelsea above us loll
Ben Foster my good friend please never take that shirt off
416263rd
Come to Northampton
As soon as I heard the first prediction for Liverpool, I knew this was nonsense
Liverpool take Chelsea in two cup finals and they’re still underneath them? Yeah I don’t see it
Hey Ben I’m a FC Barcelona fan but I do watch the Premier League. Your a good goalkeeper. I respect your goalie career. You’ve made some unbelievable saves. I hope you get signed by someone
Im happy with the Bees prediction, you are a smart man Ben haha🐝🐝
Think you’ve got the villa prediction a bit wrong. We’re definitely getting europe 👀
Ok what’s the point going through the rest of the video if you think anyone BUT liverpool will challenge the money & power city have on this league? Stick to cycling chief 👍👍👍
Ben, Forest have spent £70m quid! How haven’t we spent any money? Does signing lingard change your opinion?! Love the content!
Coyb big ups fozzy
I think the same as you, Man City are going to win the premier league this season
Man everyone always sleeps on Liverpool, I don’t think they’ll win the league but I’m going to say 2nd by 2 points again.
The footballs look 🔥
Happy with your prediction for Newcastle this season, think we're a few more signings off of going a bit higher in table but its a start & is going to be a great rebuild in the years to come
I'd agree om the most part for these. I think k too 4 will be city, Liverpool Tottenham and arsenal. Have to wait and see what Chelsea so and mam u will need a season to adapt. Bottom 3 will be Bournemouth, Everton and Brentford, I think its Everton time and so far done nothinng to help their case. Great video guys and hopefully you will get signed up soon.
I think Southampton 16th
Why don’t you come to Arsenal Ben if you hate Spurs
Ben foster at spurs but wearing arsenal shit lol come on you gunners
how can you say palace good season and place us lower than last season? top 10 this season and a FA Cup run again
As a Newcastle fan I would be buzzing with 9 :)
I like that jersey  😀
cant wait
There is no way Man City is not taking the crown in the upcoming season. Adding Erling just gives them such a presence upfront that will keep the CBs of all teams busy all game. Only injuries can stop them this season
Ben pleaseeeeee can I get the premier league ball x
Chelsea be no where near Liverpool or city
I've been fossil my I love your channels and everything please I want the ball and I love I don't Instagram but I love your videos and everything thank you and subscribe and everything take a like the video hopefully you when your matches and stuff thank you bye
not a bad set of predictions ben lad
Hate that you picked theCherries to be relegated, but love the channel!!!  Would love one of those balls!!!!😂
Pls give me a ball!
Quality vid benny boy and love the footballers perspective as always
Watford player wearing a arsenal shirt... that’s interesting
Loved the vid, can you do world cup predictons?
coyb
please sign for leeds, would love to see you there
Great prediction
Are you joking me Liverpool third you need to sort yourself out mate
Not sure you're right about forest. They've been the busiest team in the transfer window and their squad is looking good I'd say 14th
Question now you’ve seen forests signing would you still have them 19th
Bournemouth are getting overlooked by everyone, people are forgetting they were a solid prem team and only got relegated because of a dodgy GDS error in the villa game lmao
yo
I think Nottingham forest will survive because they’ve made good signings and have a good philosophy
Who agree with the predictions
Cheers Ben
I think that the cycling GK has got top 4 spot on
Sign for Man Utd as backup!
1:00 Thanking Nuke while wearing an adidas shirt just doesn’t feel right
Ben=Goatkeeper
Forest finishing 19th, below Fulham, is the most whack football prediction I think I've ever seen, absolutely no chance.
Honestly loads of good shouts in this video. Only disagreements are here. Everton looked broken last season and it’s carrying on in preseason. I know it’s only preseason but they lost 4-0 to an mls team. Nottm have quality, smacked Leicester beat arsenal only lost 1-0 to Liverpool. I put em at 12th only because they haven’t been in the Prem for a bit, if they were in the prem last year I’d put em at 8th or 9th, especially with Jessie lingard which you unfortunately didn’t know about at the top! Another great vid tho
I don’t think Ben is continuing his footballing career, he absolutely loves his yt career now. I just don’t see him joining a club anytime soon. He hasn’t even done pre season training.
I'm a sucker for giveaways
Banger video! ⚽️
Love the Arsenal jersey!
Liverpool 3rd 😂 your nuts ben
Leeds united for the trophy run
Id predict the same results tbf! I reckon brighton will be top 10 tho!
Love the channel
great video foz 😊
big miss in the prem this season absolute world class keeper lad
Come on u gunners
It’s hilarious that people still doubt Liverpool. Had 1 ‘bad’ season and now they’re seen as not good enough
Yes! Love the prediction, hopefully a team decides to pick you up! Love seeing you in the prem.
Didn’t Liverpool mess you up😂😂😂
Villa easy top 10
Great predictions, would love to have on of theese pl balls :)
Back with the great content as always 👍
How’s your fpl drafttttt
Ben, go to Toronto FC! Join Insigne and Bernadeschi! We need a good gk and it would be great to see you somewhere other than the prem in the vids! Also lots of nice parks and bike paths in and around Toronto 😉
No way Fulham survive after, once again, selling their best player upon promotion. Their owners are addicted to the free cash of parachutes, championship wins and selling championship players off to PL clubs.
I would love a premier league ball. Hard to find in America
Great video as always Ben!
I’m hoping you’re wrong with arsenals prediction. We need to get into the top 4 😂
Gotta have Man utd in top 4!
I don't get how people can think Liverpool and man city won't be the top 2.  Someone remind me to check this video next year 😂 1. Man city 2. Liverpool 3. Spurs 4. Chelsea 5. Arsenal 6. United 7. West ham 8. Newcastle 9. Leicester 10. Wolves 11. Brighton 12. Leeds 13. Everton 14. Aston Villa 15. Palace 16. Notm Forest 17. Brentford 18. Southampton 19. Bournemouth 20. Fulham
Hello lets win a prem ball
Liverpool 3rd... 🤣🤣🤣
Hope I get that ball
Man United definitely could be higher but also could be lower too
Martial 25+ goals this season
Ben promoting Nike with the Adidas logo centered above the ball is just iconic 😂
⚽️⚽️
where will u finish ben?
Class💯all though not to happy on the Liverpool review though😂
Liverpool will finish above Chelsea. No stopping City. Just hope it’s not over by February. That Arsenal top is 🔥
Class vid
You should ask for a transfer
💪🏻
Great video, I hope u predicted Chelsea right beacusea I am bit worried with many players leaving.
When Meslier goes to Nice this summer and we sign you Ben, Leeds will be higher than you placed them here.lol
Why you disrespecting Liverpool every single year ….
Can't see you with an arsenal jersey through the tears in my eyes Ben
I have liked this video and your post Ben.
1 - man city 2 - liverpool 3 - tottenham 4 - chelsea 5 - man united 6 - arsenal 7 - newcastle 8 - west ham 9 - leicester 10 - aston villa 11 - crystal palace 12 - wolves 13 - everton 14 - brighton 15 - brentford 16 - leeds 17 - nottingham forest 18 - fulham 19 - southampton 20 - bournemouth
i need this ball
If we win the league again this year that will 3 in a row
Lovely vid!
I can't believe you are putting villa in twelve I think they will deffiantely finish in top ten.
Ben bruv much love from South Africa, will be missing you in the Prem God bless cya
Can I have the ball please x
Liverpool 3rd is a terrible shout, Chelsea have to make up an 18 point gap and I’m not even sure Chelsea will finish 3rd this season, it’ll be Tottenham. Tottenham have done nothing but strengthen while Chelsea have lost half of their defence. Losing mane is massive for Liverpool but nuñez scoring 4 goals in 1 game against leipzig shows he’s got the capacity to replace mane’s goal tally. People also forget how good carvalho is and how important having ramsey as a back up to Trent is for Trent’s fitness.
Liverpool will win this year, city second, chelsea third, spurs fourth
Funny that his friend or editor edited wring next to bormouth
COYS

Love the videos mate!!
Love the vid!
This guy always doubts Liverpool. Probably because every time he played against Liverpool he got smashed
Its going to be a exciting season for sure, im really excited
Ben are you doing the fantasy premier league again this year
ayyyyyy
I need that ball
Wrong about united
West ham have been consistently been underrated this past 3 seasons no doubt we will be in europe again next season
Gonna be a very interesting season and some quality predictions. Very interesting watch Boys!
Forest are gonna have to spend!....Lol,have'nt you been watching the transfer market.....  I think Forest are gonna suprise a few.
Loving the content Ben, you’re a natural at this YouTube stuff 😂
Great predictions!
Always a great video from ben
Pretty good list
Great video
I think Forrest have a decent chance of staying up
Forest definitely spending big, safety for me
Forest have spent big. Think they are gonna surprise a lot of people this year!
Spurs a dark horse for this season. Man united looking better too. I can't see how anyone can call this season.
I think 1st-Man city 2nd-Liverpool 3rd-Chelsea 4th-Arsenal 5th-Spurs 6th-United
Absolutely love the content brother !!! Heartbreaking that we won't see you in goals this season but keep up all the great work!! Come on the CITYZENS!!!
Drop the background music ben.
Mitro plus 10 goals guaranteed 😉
The new prem footballs look nice I'd love  to get my hands on one of them🙏🏾
Yes Ben the best hope u come back to prem
Great podcast, not a fan of the music in the podcast tbh. it's waaay to invasive.
Love the vids keep it up
Hope that this will be Chelsea's title winning ball 😉💙
Any news on a club? If not I'll be happy for you to come to skyblues
Give a ball to me
Ronaldo is shit😂😂
Let's hope ur prediction is not right for man u
Very entertaining videos
Personally as my team is in the championship I would like ur opinion on championship table fans ect
GET TO LEEDS BEN THEN WE WILL COME 10TH :)
You legend
I love your personality
I think Nottingham Forrest is underrated team, they will be staying in prem, specially signing Lingard.
Come to Liverpool 🤭
One of the best prem goal keeper in this decade
Stronger predictions this year Fozzi, do think Liverpool will come out swinging again. Mane being lost is a factor but I think Diaz & Nunez are going to perform, reckon it'll be a battle between City, Pool & Chelsea again - slim margins! New Nike balls look class too
A lot of Liverpool underestimation going on here.
Forest don’t have the money to spend. 😂 at time of recording Forest had spent 60mil and brought in 10 new players. I’m more confident that we survive than you are. Do a bit of research on teams business before making an informed decision.
Mate you should sign with the baggies we need a gk and you could definitely get us back to the prem
Excited for the content this year Ben. Our predictions are a lot different but that’s the beauty of it! Buzzing for FPL too
Best gk ever
southampton get underrated every single year
Another quality video Ben, really excited already for the upcoming season, up the Chels!
Find a club ASAP mate your predictions are smelly
Robinson Goal!!!!!!!!  🖕
Another great video.... would love to see you at Arsenal!
Feel like it could be a quadruple for city this year
Football is the best
Bayern will win the Champions league this year.
Chelsea will not finish top 2 and forest won’t go down
Great video! Great prediction!
Fair predictions
Liverpool FC 3rd ? Don't think so, Liverpool are very capable of winning it.
I’d take Leeds at 16th this season
Yes sirrrrr
I predict Utd will win the Premier League with City second Liverpool third and Arsenal fourth .
Ima need that ball😮‍💨
All these prediction videos are just for the fun of it really because take United for example a lot were predicting 2nd and 3rd finishes last season and now all of a sudden they shit. They got a decent manager now so think they will be written off in most predictions but will finish in top 4.
Love the sneaky (wrong) at when predicting Bournemouth 😂 Either way, if Liverpool actually come third I hope that’s because we are in another champions league final! YNWA
forest will finish 10th in my opinion
You got it very wrong last season based on the performance of teams in Covid - that’s a factor you should’ve considered- it seems to suit the narrative to do the same this season with Liverpool- when you look at any team you look first at the manager - tuchel has not gotten the consistency out of the players as was also the case at PSG… it will impact the performances of Chelsea’s season
Nice Shirt Ben … best shirt that I have seen you in
Watched the whole thing and now im back 3 days later because I realised, they never added up his points from last years predictions so I went back to his old video and added them up. 70 points. So probably average level predictions. Not bad considering he HAD to put Watford high-ish (which added 6 points to the score) Also had a bit of a shocker with POTY and top scorer predictions. Golden Boot: Lukaku and Kane , POTY: Grealish, YPOTY: Saka
I do miss the old Mitre balls.  Propa old skool.
Each season is getting tough to predict, and I agree with a good majority of your picks except that Liverpool will win the league this year!
hello hope you can get into a premier league team before the season starts
I thought you signed for Tottenham
top 10 is getting so freaking competitive with the likes of Leicester, Wolves, Newcastle, and West Ham all vying for Europe along with the "Big 6".
what’s everyone’s disrespect towards liverpool?
Sad bout loosing one of the best goalies from prem....
Hype
hey ben, this would mean the world to me to win this ball ❤️❤️
Like the new premier season ball
lets goooo! cant wait for the next season!
Swap Arsenal & Spurs and I’ll agree with your predictions lol
I think the top 4 is spot on but chelsea will win man City second call me a mug but its a honest prediction
nunez will silence the haters ! great vid as always and really hoping i can win that prem ball !!
United in 6th... rip
Fozzie rangers need a new keeper get your agent talking to them please
🤙🤙🤙
i don’t think liverpool will struggle much with mane leaving the club. i feel like they’ll be a competitor for 1st
1. Manchester City 2. Liverpool 3. Tottenham 4. Arsenal 5. Manchester United 6. Chelsea 7. Leicester City 8. West Ham 9. Aston Villa 10. Newcastle 11. Crystal Palace 12. Everton 13. Leeds United 14. Brighton 15. Wolves 16. Nottingham Forest 17. Brentford 18. Fulham 19. Southampton 20. Bournemouth  7-11 interchangeable with each other I feel like. 12-14 a bit of a wildcards. Could end up surprising me. Or Leeds in particular could end up ranking more lower on the table. 16th place Nottingham I am ranking them higher (even though it's not actually higher ahah) just 'cause I'd like them to survive because they got rich history.
How can he wear an arsenal shirt ?  Nice as it is. Active player ???
Agree with almost all rankings except for Liverpool and Chelsea, I still believe Liverpool is the best of the rest and they will get 2nd place.
Pretty accurate I think 👍
epic ball comment
Forest aren't going down Mid table easy 🔴⚪You Redssss We have spent big
Suprised Newcastle isn’t up there
You support arsenal mate
Hello ben
I think Forest will stay up around 15th/16th. Really think Everton could be in trouble, not strengthened and lost Richarlison. DCL is injury prone and can't see where the goals will come from.
liverpool will win the league
Chelsea surely don't end up in top 4. Spurs and Arsenal caught them up quality-wise last season, and have since recruited better
I’d rather have seen ben that turner ngl sorry you missed our mate love to see you still representing the club with the shirt anyway good luck next season
Not gonna lie I actually kinda respect the predictions
Well done Ben. Man City champions again for sure 💙
What a video this is mate....great predictions, wouldn't of put any team in a different position⚽️⚽️
Think that’s pretty spot on, although anything can happen in the Prem!
As an Everton fan I hope you’re right, but we are 100% one of the favourites to go down
Ben really hope to see you play next season
I see what Mr Foster is doing.🧐 he is hoping to get signed by arsenal because he’s wearing there shirt.!?!
Love the arsenal top
Thank you for being such a fantastic role model. As a footballer i really look up to you. The journey you have been on is outrageous, and how much you have fought to get where you are now. That is something i look up to. So thanks.
Villa for top 10, id say 8th
As a United fan I think 6th is fair. They will have a rocky start but will improve throughout the season as ten Haag gets them playing in his style of football
Think you are pretty much spot on barring Everton being in big trouble, think Lingaard signing for Forest is massive and could be the difference for them!
Could do a job back at United
those balls look class ben!
pretty sure Liverpool will finish ahead of Chelsea this year, other than that the predictions seem quite fair and knowledgeable...
Forrest in 19th?
Just a note for me, I don’t really like the music in the background when you guys are talking. It’s a bit too loud for my liking, I’m not sure if anyone else feels that way
I think I saw you in Murphy bar in Portugal
City and Liverpool still miles ahead to everyone so those too are the only 2 teams for top 2 spots for me
Liverpool!!!!!
Up the foz
1 - Spurs 2 - Man City 3 - Liverpool 4 - Chelsea 5 - Arsenal 6 - Man United 7 - West Ham 8 - Newcastle 9 - Aston Villa 10 - Crystal Palace 11 - Leicester 12 - Brighton 13 - Wolves 14 - Nott Forest 15 - Everton 16 - Leeds 17 - Brentford 18 - Southampton 19 - Fulham 20 - Bournemouth  And with my final prediction... THE CYCLING GK TO COME BACK TO THE PREMIER LEAGUE!!! UP THE FOZCAST!!!!
Class predictions, i think Brighton have a chance of going on a cup run and getting to a semi of either the League/FA cup.
Done cycling gk
Great predictions
Please pick me at random to win the football 😜.
Love the video and I hope Chelsea finish 2nd or above!
WOOOO
come to arsenal
Come to Charlton
Love the videos Ben!
As a mags fan I’d say you’re not far off where we’ll end up, I’m predicting 8th but as long as we’re solid and get away from the relegation zone early without any last week jitters for once I’ll be happy
Can’t wait for the new season, hopefully a premier league club signs you.
SEWY
Solid prodictions but I think you might be out a couple of places with sone
Chelsea are winning the league. We have Raheem the dream
Just got in contact with you about winning your contest. Your team took $133.08 From me! Then tried to charge $100 customs fee. What’s up with that Ben? I reported it to my bank. I want my $133 back! Cheats
Let's goooooo
Why do people say liverpool won't be in the title race every single year even though there is no indication they won't be, it makes no sense
I need this giveaway🤩🤩🤩
Bang on with the top 3 I think sterling will provide what lukaku didn’t when it comes to a threat to goal for chelsea. It’ll be a good one but if haaland does what you all predicted city could run away with it. I’ve got haaland to score about 17 prem goals next season. CMON CITY
✔️
Brighton top ten easily
I just want to see Liverpool get some European football.
Come on Ben you king 👑, hopefully we see in a hashtag shirt soon
BFG - Ben Foster Goalie
Yo
We were on a very similar wavelength!
Arsenal top 4🔴⚪️⚽️
Liverpool 1st  - Nunez >>>> Haaland
Hopefully you play in Ligue 1 oe 2 next year so I might be able to enter the giveaways 😂
The Southampton one😂😂😂 I must have missed the important players leaving and the fact we haven’t done much business
Come on the Foz
Can I have one? Plzzzz
i’m here for the giveaway, i also liked
Tottenham a “big boy”    Behave Ben.
Would’ve loved you to come to forest for the year!
The new prem ball 😍
My friend shot the match ball we were playing with into space and we never found it again, so I could really do with a brand new one !
I'm not on Instagram 😭😭😭 wish I could still get one
🚀
Liverpool 1st
Fozzy didn't think forest would spend big but they only went and signed 12 players
What's up Ben Foster 👋
Solid premier league predictions- entertaining video. Also, that new Prem ball is looking sensational, big fan of it.
Hey Ben u r a inspirationl keeper to me please don't hang the gloves up yet I have huge respect for u wish u were at pne with Woodman and the lads there is only one cycling gk ben foster
Liverpool 3rd absolutely off ur head man
this is years is liverpools calling it
Love the vids and great predictions. I personally got Chelsea winning it all this year
What a vid. I Think brentfort was insane last season. Big like from here
Hi Ben class vid as per usual
Liverpool being underestimated again, of course this guy is an ex bin sniffer.
Quality as always! As a Newcastle fan I have to say i’d be buzzing with a top 10 finish this year 👍🏻
Fulham are finishing 1st
I want the ball
Man United now have secured the signings of Malacia, Martinez, and Eriksen. Now are apparently after Pavard and obviously still after de jong. If they also get those 2 I think champions league football has to be inevitable.
My predictions:  1. Man City 2. Liverpool  3. Chelsea 4. Tottenham  5. Man Utd  6. Arsenal 7. West Ham  8. Newcastle  9. Leicester  10. Wolves  11. Aston Villa  12. Brighton 13. Crystal Palace 14. Nottingham Forest  15. Brentford  16. Everton  17.  Leeds  18. Southampton  19. Fulham 20. Bournemouth
Come to leeds please 💛
Shame you ain’t gon be saving these balls this season 🥲
Westham 8th?! ⚒🫠
West Ham are massive
Why you wearing an ars*nal shirt???
Love seeing you in an arsenal shirt 😍🔴⚪️
Hello Ben Foster from thailand. I'm FC your. GK ManU - Now.
Great vid not so sure about the prediction. Keep up the work
Yes Ben
I agree with majority of them but I believe Forest will have it in them to stay up
Ser get back into the prem. I love ur style!
As an Everton fan I'd take take your hand off for 14th place next season, I think we'll struggle more than that tho
shame we won't be seeing you kick the anniversary ball about this year, hopefully get you on some football challenges instead
Hi everyone, please do not reply or engage with comments saying that you have won the giveaway. It's a scam. We are dealing with this now. We will also not ask you for any payment details if you do win the giveaway, and winners will be contacted on Instagram.
Honestly Arsenal may get CL next season after leeching of Pep and stealing Jesus and Zinchenko
Interesting predictions
Great content as always. Thanks Ben!
I’m a Liverpool fan so I have of course I will put them in 1 but Haaland realy looks dangerous🙂  1.Liverpool 2.Man City 3.Tottenham 4.Chelsea 5.Arsenal 6.West Ham 7.Man United 8.Newcastle 9.Brighton 10.Leicester  11.Wolves 12.Crystal Palace 13.Everton 14.Aston Villa 15.Brentford 16.Nottingham 17.Leeds 18.Southampton  19.Fulham 20.Bournemouth
as a southampton fan i think we’ll surprise a few people, we’ve signed 6 players. 4 young very talented players who have potential to go to the very top, a backup gk and joe aribo who is quality and has a winning mentality with european experience. all our signings have improved us and we’re still looking to sign more attacking players to give us that quality in depth. our new owners have spent and we have haven’t even sold yet where as in previous years we’d have to sell to buy. we’re in a much better place now i feel.
Yes fozzy
Is he a arsenal supporter? Whats with the shirt
Wake up   Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family   God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved   it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature   Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word  scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love   scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced  Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing   ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain   Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one   yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days  A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus   you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you   the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right  God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ   my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.  you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too   This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved   So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus    Acts 4.12  And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved   John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me  God bless
solid list 👍🏼
Sad that we are not going to see u in the prem Ben 😥
Interesting predictions but overall it’s going to be a great season none the less
Big Up For! Hoping you can get onto a team for this season in the Prem. Big big fan from over the pond in Massachusetts and a fellow goalie myself! Love the content and hope we get to see more. Have a good one lad!
Solid
Can't believe he went for Arsenal to finish above Manchester United  🤡🤡
best looking ball since 2007/08
Great video mate. Really hope arsenal scrape top 4 though 😂
Love your content mate. But Saints haven’t lost any players contrary to what you said, and we’ve signed 6. I think we’ll be okay 👍🔴⚪️
Good vid mate Chelsea for the title 👑👑
Great video, disappointed to see Liverpool put in 3rd though. Liverpool and city finished a country mile ahead of Chelsea who were nearly fighting for there place in the top 4. But still loved the video
As a Chelsea fan we won’t be getting second it’s not going to happen I hate to say it but I think 4th and I honestly think Liverpool will win the league city selling Jesus and sterling was a big mistake Haaland is a worldie but has constant muscle injury’s Diaz is a more then adequate replacement for mane and this Nunez lad looks class to keep your on on spurs to conte is building a monster should be a good season though it’s very competitive
What’s with the LFC hate?? First you predicted them 4th last season and now 3rd…. City and LFC are the best two teams by a mile..  yes we lost mane but LFC has proven they know how to recruit, they have a system that works etc. Nunez will shock a lot of people when he bangs in 20+ goals.
Swap arsenal and spurs and Chelsea and Liverpool then it’s perfect
ซับไทยแลนด์ 🙏🙏🙏
🎉
Top 4 is gonna be thought
There is just no way Chelsea will finish over Liverpool this season.
Those nike balls damn🔥
Didn't think you would bring up the brighton prediction, big up for owning up to it haha
Liverpool at third!!! Naa mate first of course
love the content! but liverpool got to be top 2 easily mate!!!
Last season you thought Liverpool would come 4th. You tried to justify it and then reveal your revelation that they'll come fucking 3rd this season? They lost the PL by a point, miles ahead of 2nd.. and you expect people to continue watching the video? You end of a bell.
Madddd how many people underestiqme us all the time(liverpool)
Sign for Sunderland
Loving how Ben has only respect for the other teams and players. Class act 👏🏻
God luck with a new club Ben! The PL ball is 🔥🔥
comment
Thank you for picking me
Gg
Please pick me
Mane has been sold long ago haha
Hope to see you in the prem this season Ben!
Now make a championship table prediction 🤣   Watford getting relegated again after this video 🤣😭😭
🔥🔥
Can’t wait to see what the season unfolds! 🥵
You f*cking Legend!!
Cheeeeelseeeea
only one thinking chelsea will not end in cl places?
Liverpool prem champions ❤️
Imma take 14th just to get some stability back at the team certainly after the shitty season we had
Pretty good predictions! Hoping you find a team soon!
Gave it a like fox but I think you have underestimated forest as they spent some money recently
Some decent predictions
Southampton aren’t finishing below 14th next season
I need the football 😎
Think forest will stay up, lingard is a huge signing
Accuracy hardly matters when it's about these predictions but just how much clarity we fans need to have when we hope about where they might finish.
Everton are going down
Yes frank, up the chez 🍒🍒
"they only sign non prem players". english people bias in full effect
what a wicked ball
Class predictions this year Ben💪
City for the win. 18. Forest 19. Fullham 20. Bournemouth
Hello are you from England put on from Australia I can already get over there will take me two days
Always enjoy these vids before a season really puts you in the mood for the season ahead hope you find a club and keep up the good work ben👍🏻🤛🏻
Lotta love from Barnsley Ben!
You’re amazing hopefully I will see you in the game this season
It's astonishing how someone how played in the prem has 0 ball knowledge
awesome prediction and great video i enjoyed it allot big fan of you keep up the work <3
Is benny going to play in championship?
Fair prediction there
I'm sorry but that music got jarring after the first minute, unnecessary mate
King
Will miss the in game go pro visuals :(
Love it Foz
LETS GO
Forest have had a outstanding transfer window
Pls.
City that’s so wrong
Newcastle make ECL
Excellent presentation on the video. C’mon man city.
All the very best Ben for your future. Hope we see you again in the Prem big guy!
we need a new ball for tuesday nights!
music is way too loud
oof man city winning it again. Doesn’t look east but we’ll see!
My Sunday league team could do with those balls
Cycling gk is still one of the best keepers
Ok, let me get this right, a profesionel goalkeeper, from England. Makes a prediction for the Premier League
When watford got relegated, the only thing that on my mind was if we would get videos from the cycling gk. I enjoy the videos so much and I wish you the best of luck. Also Liverpool is winning the PL
Ben come sign for Sheffield Wednesday we neeed u
Love the video disagree with a few but fine.
I’m a Brighton fan and thanks for not putting us 18th again best wishes mate
Liverpool weren't a one man team with mane, so why do they think other players can't get the numbers he does. We have many different options and mane was just one of them
I think you got a lot of that spot on. I think Forest might let you down big style. Honestly think they will finish mid table. I think Leeds will be in the bottom three. Good luck with your playing career but hey what a career you could have going forward in the media
I love you ben
for me, tottenham gonna finish higher than chelsea this season
Cant believe the prem has been going on for 30 years. Felt like yesterday when the 🐐gk was playing for united. Balls look incredible
Ben how can you say that you think that liverpool will finish 3rd when liverpool is only team in prem that can compete with city and every season they have over 80 points
Come to the Arsenal m8! 🙌🏼
Protien bor
come on Ben, Spurs under Conte was the strongest team in the league, they are the only team that beat Man City back to back, they can go toe to toe against Arsenal or Liverpool last season, and they just gettting better, i think they going to finish 2nd. and 3 team that would be relegated are Bournemouth, Brighton, and Everton.
Come to The A-League
Friggin ledge mate would love one of those new balls 😍
As a city fan I do see my champions league top 4 would be  1.City 2.Liverpool  3.Spurs  4.United
Taught he would’ve talked more about why Chelsea would be second!!! They’ll be fighting for too 4.
Hi
First video I’ve seen good stuff
Manchester United #1 … 🫣😶 ten hags at the wheel
BEN, you need to start a recycling campaign,  Alongside the CYCLING GK you will have the RECYCLING GK  (in aid of more bins/recycling bins alongside the seafront/ nature walks and near rivers)
Can’t wait to see you back in the Prem ❤
Spurs finishing second you heard it here
Liverpool gunna win it🤷‍♂️
Ready to see you back with a club
Unpopular opinion. Chelsea have gotten weaker this transfer window. They still have some holes to fill in defense. And they finished last season with some poor form. They still have time in the transfer window, but I think they may miss out on top 4
Ben prediction about Manchester United is wrong he have to consider the results of pre season tour vs Liverpool where United thrashed Liverpool 4-0 so for me United finish 2nd and Chelsea will finish 9th
i don’t know about anyone else, but i think a usl or mls side would suit ben really well
Sorry Foz you’re bang wrong about Liverpool for a start - a “transition season”?????  Dear oh dear
Great predictions cant wait for the new season. Really hope you get signed soon. Much love
Spurs top 4 🔒
These are some solid predictions
Takin the piss with united mate
Top 4 is going to be a close one this season is my feeling. Also think Forest might surprise a lot of people
I think Fozzy has got the Liverpool selection spot on. Definitely going to struggle without Mane and will be an off season
Hopefully this one goes a bit better 😂 but keep it up good vids 👍
Do you wanna change your prediction on Forest after we have spent a load of money and got Jesse Lingard……..
Buzzing for this season. After last there was a title top4 race and relegation battle going to the end of the season, plus a World Cup. Gonna be mint
Ur gonna be wrong about united😊
My premier league predicion:  1. Liverpool 2. Manchester City  3. Spurs🤮 4. Arsenal 5. Chelsea 6. Manchester United  7. Leicester 8. West ham 9. Newcastle  10. Crystal Palace 11. Brighton 12. Wolves 13. Everton 14. Aston Villa 15. Leeds 16. Brentford 17. Nottingham Forest 18. Fulham 19. Southampton  20. Bournemouth
great predictions
Big up Ben from across the pond, big fan. I hope my team Man City makes it three in a row!
talking about the premier league coz ur sad about being In the championship
I’m thinking Tham are gonna have a top 2 season
A former Man United player wearing an Arsenal kit?
Fantastic vid!
Dubs
As a City fan ive got to say that you  underestimate Man Utd. I actually think that they will get a top 4 and Leeds have some really good players coming in so I think that they will place around 9-8-7th
hahaha muppet
Raphina wasn't a Premier League player...now look... we're good at scouting the unknown...let's hope it continues and they prove you wrong 🤣 personally think we'll have a much better season this season but we'll see 💙💛
Spurs will be a wild card in my opinion because they have made some very good signings but its a matter of if those signings can be used correctly by Konte and if they can keep their stamina with playing Champions League as well.
Go to waltham abbey fc
Decent predictions but West Ham didn’t get to the final
Hopefuly one day i will see you at the Sky S ports because you know ball... What a legend
Cracking Vid! Some dodgy predictions though Ben! 😜 Can't see Chelsea getting 2nd, they are looking to be the most risk of falling out of the top 4 but will just manage it in 4th
Would be great to have Rachel Brown-Finnis on your podcast to have a female Perspective about goalkeepers
What a legend Ben is! Newcastle maybe a little be higher and Man. United will be a team to watch this season with the new changes
lets goooo
Fook off foster forest will be top half of table guaranteed easy
Great vid
Very very similar to my predictions this year. Also agree with you on the shout on Henderson at Forrest; will be a great space to show and grow  glove 🧤 ⚽️
Hello,one of your biggest fan,even tho I am a left wing ,I still got inspired by you,an amazing gk.keep up the great work ♥️
I am brighton fan who lives in america and i think we are going to get 6th in the premier leauge this season and place will get 17th
hope i win the giveaway
I hope arsenal get that 4th spot
hoping this season is good, all the teams look good this year and I think the fight for relegation and the title will be very close this year again
He playes for Watford and he wears a arsenal training kit
i really hope you can get back out on the pitch again real soon ben. world class content as always mate
Nice one Fozzy
Nottingham forest stays in the prem next season !
foster to arsenal even tought i am a man u fan
Com'on the boys!!
I’ll take 14th - UTFT
Top class as always 🔥
yes now frickin’ pair of balls them
Writing off Liverpool again
Not a bad prediction… I think I’m hesitant on Chelsea though. Lost a fair few big names from last season, they’ll have to hope their new signings settle really quickly. Also I’d swap West Ham and Leicester. As an Arsenal fan I hope you’re wrong about us, but I can see why we’ve been put there

I think liverpool will finish above Chelsea if i’m honest
Balls!
Great video Fos, shame about the top 🤣
time stamps for each team?
Il be very happy with a newcastle top half this season
Liverpool should be higher ngl
As an Everton fan id be made up with 14th this season. Just need to get a few more signings in and give Frank some time
It's weird that most of what I predicted is what Ben said or close to it
Lovely balls
Great predictions. I honestly could see United finishing above Arsenal and maybe Tottenham this season though with the way Ten Hag is going to let have his squad playing. And after the embarrassing preseason Everton loss to Minnesota United, I could see them being close to the relegation zone again!
Bournemouth will finish higher than Fulham, forest, leeds, Southampton
I would not disagree a lot with the predictions. However as an Arsenal fan I would obviously hope to finish top 4 and above Spurs. COYG
Hope you can ship American
Chelsea for the premier league this season 💙 video liked on YouTube and insta 👍
Can't wait for the new season
1. City 2. Spurs 3. Liverpool 4. Chelsea 5. Arsenal 6. Newcastle 7. Man Utd 8. West Ham 9. Brighton  10. Wolves 11. Leicester 12. Villa 13. Crystal Palace 14. Everton 15. Forest 16. Leeds 17. Soton  18. Brentford 19. Fulham 20. Bournemouth
I hope i win this ball !
Liked 👍
ben just casually wearing an arsenal shirt
Great if Newcastle can finish top ten, and I’d love a good cup run 🏆
Hope you get signed soon (if you want to)
New to this channel but this is some top tier content. I love the layout of how you did this prediction! Keep em coming :)
As a United fan, I have high hopes that Erik ten Hag will be able to get us back into Champion’s League football! (But then again, you did play in the Premier League so your predictions might be right ;-;)
Some solids predictions
Love the surprising predictions from you ben cant wait to see your score at the end of the season
Can i have a ball please
Love the video Ben, I think this is a much much better prediction than last year!
Finally we've got the best prediction of this pl season! Friggin legends!! All the best for y'all
Brilliant vid mate, (baggie fan)!
Ben and ramsdale in arsenal partnership coming up?!
Great vid 👌
I gotta get that ball man
1. City 2. Liverpool 3. Chelsea 4. Spurs 5. Arsenal 6. West Ham 7. Scum 8. Newcastle 9. Wolves 10. Brighton 11. Leicester 12. Villa 13. Palace  14. Leeds 15. Everton 16. Saints 17. Fulham 18. Bournemouth  19. Brentford 20. Forest  lets see how I do come next year
frank doesnt know what hes going on about! 😂completely agree with you ben!!
Good shout with these! Love Ben's take on Henderson going to forrest.  If anyone knows what he's going through it's gonna be you
yooooo
Praying United finish higher
Did u watch brentford once??? They played awful football
Love the videos but get rid of that naff music
Everton is going to suffer with the loss of Rocharlison if Iwobi or DCL don't fire. Gordan going to have a great season
Up the Chels, I’d be very happy with 2nd!! Cheers fozzy
Do a championship one also ?
Good predictions mate, I think I’ll Forrest will stay up and Fulham will go down
This is gonna be the most exciting prem season in a while!
Arsenal getting top 4 imo. Great signings so far got a great squad now
Big up the GK
Sad to see you not in the top flight this year
What a lege! Always look forward to your videos but do miss gopro in goal! Hopefully you'll sign for a top club this coming season! Let me have the balls too!
Tottenham are winning the leauge
👌
Best show ever 💪🔥
Bournemouth bottom 😫 cmon fozzy
I disliked the editing in this video. The music went too loud when the team logos came up and was a bit too loud throughout the entire video.
Love to watch you.
Come on the boyssss
Arsenal the 🏆
Great video!!
Up the CGK 👏
The balls would be perfect for my new mental health charity team 🧡 Lift the Weight FC
Let's winnn
Banger🔥🔥🔥🔥
Another good vid bro
Man Utd 6th I think top 4
Come on the Albion !!
ben is so biased against Liverpool every year is a new excuse. Yet he acknowledges he got it wrong he does the same thing
Fingers crossed you are wrong are about West Ham! Up the Cycling GK and Up the Fozcast!!!
great video
Do think united could be surprises this year after our horrendous season last season, obviously nowhere near winning the league but 4th spot I think is more up for grabs than people might think
Arsenal are making top 4 🙌 and you know it💪COYG
Great predictions Ben, but theres only one team winning the prem this year and its got be LIVERPOOL ...... ⚽️⚽️⚽️
Up the cgk 🚲
Please reduce the music volume when transitioning.
Believe Everton will get relegated
Nice one lads
Sign for Oxford
Hope United do better than what you predicted.  But other than that very good predictions.
Yes Ben
Feel free to drop down a couple of divisions and come to Wednesday, Number 1 shirt still available aswell. And anything to see the vlogs round hillsborough
Loved the video keep up the good work
A championship prediction maybe ?
Ben really loves city😂
united will be better this year ten hag is an incredible coach
Villa will finish above wolves fella. You lot are in the mud
Woohoooo
keep it up!
No Erling in my team and i'm starting to worry
Hopefully can see more BTS on your next club or job, (maybe a pundit?)
Come to Leeds mate💛💙
I think Man U will be a bitter higher placed this season, maybe around 4th. And I’ve got high hopes for the team I support Everton to be around 10th, they are not looking too good now in pre season but I’ve got faith they’ll impress in the league !
I feel that these are pretty good predictions, I'd maybe have Brentford a little lower as Erikson is going to be massive miss
as a man city fan I hope haaland doesn't need to face a wave of injuries
good predictions mate
Someone needs to sign Ben up
Tbh I would swap forest and Fulham but other then that great video as always
I was actually soo happy seeing him in an arsenal shirt. Thought he’d signed😂
Best keeper in the prem hopefully we will see you this year
Love this videos!
Looking good in an Arsenal kit! Could've done with you a few seasons ago but pretty happy with Ramsdale now. Would you do a Prem GK ranking video? Or too controversial for public consumption?!
Ben, you are the nicest goalkeeper ever and your amazing in goal
Absolute Legend
City, Liverpool, Man United, Tottenham, Chelsea, etc
Need you back playing soon for some training and match day vlogs
1 Man City  2 Liverpool  3 Tottenham  4 Chelsea  5 Man United  6 Arsenal  7 West Ham  8 Newcastle  9 Leicester  10 Aston Villa  11 Brighton  12 Crystal Palace  13 Wolves  14 Southampton  15 Brentford  16 Nottingham Forest  17 Fulham  18 Leeds 19 Everton  20 Bournemouth
fantastic show bro happy retirement super kepper hon spurs
would love Newcastle to get into Europe this year!
Up the Fozcast
Let's Talk Manchester United  6th u joking. They got Erikksen , Martinez and de Jong is coming (mark my words) So with these lads in the door do u change ur prediction...
Great video again
Those balls are cool
Top videos. Your wrong about Liverpool thought deffo win it this year
Hi
cg
should maybe do a video after transfer deadline day, to see if you’d change any positions
Come to leeds
Great predictions, nearly match my predictions for next season. Love the content!!
Listening to his predictions on Leeds to see how he talks about them and if he’s gonna go to there seemed like it could be Leeds could be in for religation
Wolves should be higher because they are looking quite good in pre-season 🖤🧡🐺
Ben are you going to sign for another club, or are you maybe thinking about going into coaching now?
Tottenham Hotspur is better than Arsenal
Loving the content, praying for Liverpool EPL
I agree with you apart from forest
UP THE FOZCAST!
I’m a keeper from America who has a popped football to use for training and in 7 games this summer 7 clean sheets and also I got cut from my school junior team last year
fair point about the chez tbh. we’ve got a lot of interesting potential in our squad, but you know 19 other teams have more or are just world beaters so you know. wouldn’t mind the fos as our number 2 for the vibes though.
Do one for the championship
Hammers surely atleast getting Europe again
It would be a good business if Arsenal sign you for the 3rd GK which will not only challenge Turner but also your best friend Ramsdale.
Ben who would you like to have sign you
Keep up the great work Ben and the team
I can’t believe you put Man united 6th???
Class vid 🙌
Thankyou for putting Chelsea at 2nd but I don't think we'd have a sniff at 2nd if we don't sign another attacker/ striker. I'm worried about losing Top4 position.
My team needs a match ball, think villa will finish higher and nothingham and Fulham should swap places otherwise I think you’ve done a good prediction! 👍
When will people learn. Liverpool will not drop off cause Mane has gone. Chelsea have lost the entire defence but Liverpool lost Mane so Chelsea will make up that gap of 18 points. Every year Liverpool predicted to get worse every year it’s wrong
Chels top😶
Love it Ben
We need to see you in the premier league again this year Ben
Fantastic pod…. Keep it going… Up The Fozcast!!
That ball looks slick
I agree apart from tottenham and united I would swap around
sick video man
Great work Ben, like the predictions, hope you get a gig soon cheers...
this background music ruined the video for me...video wouldve been 10x better without the music
Hope you sign for someone soon!
those nikes are sexy. up the shrimps
the mighty albion
Friggen ledge mate!
Can't say I agree with all your predictions but love every take you had, absolute hero you are
Sup
hey!
Frank editing this 😒
Top 3 will be same as last season in Man City, Liverpool and Chelsea.
This is my PL prediction for the 22/23 season  1. Man City 2. Liverpool 3. Chelsea 4. Man United 5. Tottenham 6. Arsenal 7. Wolves 8. West Ham 9. Leeds 10. Newcastle 11. Brighton 12. Villa 13. Leicester 14. Everton 15. Palace 16. Southampton 17. Forest 18. Brentford 19. Fulham 20. Bournemouth  These are just my predictions so I don’t expect anyone to agree with me:)
I think Spurs could finish in second place this season!
that’s all me
Wherever you go this season, hope you have a good season. Wish you the best and I enjoy your videos and the content you put out is amazing! Good Luck this season.
Brilliant watch this video love all your content keep it up mate👍
Honestly one of the best people to watch. I would of put Newcastle a bit higher but of course I’m going to be saying that as I support Newcastle
As a Newcastle Fan, I really hope they get into top 10 this season
Glad to see you in a Gunners top! Hoping for a top 4 finish, I think with Gabi Jesus and hopefully Zinchenko soon Arsenal will be surprising a lot of folks this year.
best lad out there
Im not happy about you putting Bournemouth 20th. They'll finish mid table I can guarantee that.
CMON CITY!!
Hi Ben
How has no club signed you yet mate, top tier experience with a bunch of skill still, it astounds me that nobody, especially new premiership clubs, haven’t signed you
Bummed you're not yet signed but will love to watch your show and content throughout the upcoming season!
I think people will be surprised by how well Arsenal will do this season. I predict a trophy and a surprise top three finish.
Gr8 video
Hope you go to the championship so we can see some games🙏
👍
I love how every single pick you said "interesting this one"
Spurs winning the league
Newcastle top 10 fairs
i havent watched it yet but he wears an arsenal shirt so im guessing he wants them to win
Time is short   To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Ben needs signed asap!
Let’s goooo
Super video!
Come on
You deserve so much credit!
would love to win one ov them balls and pretty much agree with most 1 or 2 i prob would ov swapped but its a prediction
Shame not got a club this season, outstanding keeper and always been consistent over the years. Does this just mean more Fozcast and cycling GK 😊
Love the videos keep up the hard work.
City and winning the championsleague? No chance they need more than Haaland for that
Liverpool>>>>>>>>>>>>>chelsea
Chelsea winning the league!
How dare u put palace 13th 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Forest are an excellent side under Cooper. They made Prem opposition look absolutely average in the FA Cup. You don't beat Leicester 4-1 and KO Arsenal for nothing. They'll be the surprise of the season. They've strengthened brilliantly in the window already and look comfortably Premier League in my view. I estimate they'll finish 12th.
Liverpool 3rd LOL It’s guna be the same again City and LFC fighting for the title  And the rest will faff around Guarantee 2nd and 3rd will have 15+ points difference
🇲🇽
Love the vid hope I win the footy  Best gk ever
Good vid CGK
Oi Oi fozzay!!!!
https://youtu.be/anAnR9ddBo4  Check out my #premierLeague predictions and let me know your thoughts!   Also be sure to subscribe to help me reach my goal of 100 subscribers by the beginning of the world cup
with the signings we’ve made there’s no reason we can’t stay up in my opinion , call me biast idc but the transformation we made was just wow
as an arsenal fan i have tottenham and arsenal switched and Chelsea and manchester united switched.
I need a new ball
Ben, West Ham were not in the final of the Europa League? The final was Frankfurt Vs Rangers?
Hope a club gives you a shot, Ben! You deserve to stay in the Prem.
That Arsenal shirt looks magnificant on you Ben! :D
Threw a few surprises in mine Forgot about Villa originally sorry Villians 😅 1.Man City 2.Spurs 3.Liverpool 4.Chelsea 5.Man Utd 6.West Ham 7.Arsenal 8.Newcastle 9.Leicester 10.Brighton 11.Aston Villa 12.Wolves 13.Crystal Palace 14.Southampton 15.Everton 16.Nottingham Forest 17.Leeds 18.Fulham 19.Brentford 20.Bournemouth
loved the predictions, Newcastle are gonna surprise everyone
Nice to see someone giving chelsea the respect they deserve. I wonder what club you'll be at next season Ben. I know you said about mls.
Loved your vids for a while hope to see you in the prem again.
City=1 Liverpool=2 Man utd=3 Chelsea=4 Spurs=5 Arsenal=6
You fancy coming back to wrexham?
come on the boys!
1.Man City  2. Liverpool  3. Chelsea  4. Man united  5. Spurs  6. Arsenal   Yes I do support man united
Please say I win
hurry up and get signed so i can buy the jersey
Can I get the ball please
Cant believe you aint got a team yet Mate.   Thought you'd get snapped up as soon as you left Watford.   Can't understand premier managers. Class is permanent.  🙌 safe hands.  Hope you get sorted soon mate. I'd have you at Spurs in a shot.
Boshh
Amazing format! Hopefully can grab the ball as well :)
Great shouts but shame your not bad playing yet, give arsenal a call, you look good in that shirt 😜
Safe hands fozzy, what a ball😍
Liverpool underrated in predictions as always
Gutted you haven't ever came to celtic you would love it
this guy is a friggin legend, perfect character, love him
Hopefully forrest can stay up but a solid prediction id say
Hoping and praying your Man U prediction is very wrong
So how will haaland score 30 and Nunez not?? Both not prem proven 😂 this is comedy gold this vido
Hahahaha keep doubting Liverpool, they prove people wrong time and time again, they will finish top 2, and it won’t be 2nd.
How about arsenal
Sign as a backup for city 👀
I think leicester are going to shock people this season because there only the prem to focus on.
The Easter eggs 😂
finally Arsenal signed Ben come on you Gooners
Ben if you want and can. Try to connect with Man United again, maybe as back up keeper but more as an youtuber inside the club making great videos with the club and players as you do!
Would love to have seen a foster CS against Haaland!
Villa top 10 easy
Defo a make or break season for Dean Henderson, hope Forest stay up! Think Brentofrd and Leeds will struggle, and there is always a surprise team every year.
Seein you in an arsenal top is interesting. Pleasure seeing you on here always love you’re videos. Much love from America hopefully you can send a matchball across the pond☺️
Man utd think there to go dbecause
Ben you love everybody. But Joni loves Chachie
Loving the content!
I love these podcasts. Keep it up Ben and hopefully see you back in the Prem soon.
Would love to win those balls! They look class
Southampton in the drop zone... come on fozzy lad. Guarantee all 3 promoted clubs will finish below Southampton
Its getting boring now that people write Liverpool off every season. Them and City are so far ahead of the rest it’s a joke. Liverpool have lost Mane yes but City have lost Jesus, Sterling, Fernandinho and Zinchenko whilst there new players 2 of whom are coming into a new league will need time to bed in. What’s with the lack of respect to Liverpool?
As a Brighton fan I think you owe me a favour 😂
Sign for hashtag
I have just started watching your channel  I love it
Lovely ball
Cracking vid as always
agreed with just about all the predictions. Think Forrest are safe at the expense of Fulham though
Class way to do predictions with the points love that! Might have to give it a go myself
What a lovely ball ⚽️
Mate. Just sign for Wycombe will you!
As a Leeds fan I think some of the new players will be the difference between us this and last season we will have a stronger midfield along with some other exciting players I reckon we will get 13th
Great predictions ben . By the way I want to mention how much of an inspiration you are to me. I think it's unbelievable how you can do this and still stay at such a high level professionally. Thanks Ben can't wait for the next vid
Pretty solid predictions👏
You did Man U dirty they are easily finishing top 4
Love the predictions Benjamin. Excited for the content this upcoming season!
That Arsenal top 😍😍
Ayyy, my gee. Sick ball and the one of the best YouTuber in the world!!! Legend! Can’t believe he puts his time into making his video during his season on and off the pitch!!!!!
Always safe hands in you Fozzy, hope to see you back in the prem soon! Liverpool to win the league and Fulham, Leeds and Bournemouth to be relegated
Get rid of the music
Yes boys!
Good predictions mate!
Wil the volgs keep coming even if you are not signed to a team?
Wolves are never cracking top 10 and Aston villa will get that Conference league spot just you wait and see
Top video, worry for Leicester a bit tho, not moved forwards so we may drop back a bit
Mate what team are you signing for?
Bosh
Great Video as always on the CGK Channel 👌🏻
Who r u joining next season
Get yourself to Fulham!
Hi Ben Foster are you an Arsenal fan
Hope in the end you will be back in Prem this season
1. Man City  2. Liverpool  3. Tottenham 4. Chelsea  5. Manchester United  6. Arsenal (my team) pains me to say  7. West Ham  8. Newcastle  9. Aston Villa 10. Leicester 11. Crystal Palace 12. Brighton 13. Wolves 14. Everton 15. Leeds 16. Brentford 17. Nottingham Forest 18. Southampton 19. Fulham 20. Bournemouth  Great to see you representing the Arsenal merch as an Arsenal fan myself. Good luck to the lionesses tonight 🦁🔴⚪️
Nottingham forest fan 🔴
Liverpool 3rd Come on Fozzy, Itll be a 2 horse race again, either Liverpool or City with 90 odd points again 🤔
Tottenham is buying every living thing they see in the market...gonna encounter many flops. 6th spurs.
cycling gk what team are you hoping to join in the future?
Although I’m an arsenal I really believe in us this season, gabriel Jesus has looked fantastic so far in preseason, but to kick into the next gear I think need a couple more signings. I think 4th and a Europa league run will do it for the gunners this year! Also keep up the good work Ben!!
⚽️ 😁
Love the content highlight of my day when you upload keep it up we miss u in the prem already ⚽️🥅❤️
Swap Chelsea for Spurs lads and it's looking good! :) Keep up the good work boys!
Love from INDIA 🇮🇳 ❤️
Gotta agree with you on most of your choices there except Man United, after watched them in pre season I think they’re gonna do much better than people think. Also agree with you about Forest, great team and I hope they do well but unfortunately I can see them struggling to remain in the prem next season
I just can’t watch these videos anymore when that guy with you Fozzy is on them. He is just so insufferable and looks like a Toby Jug. Appreciate he’s your mate but he’s honestly the worst
The music is so annoying.
Manchester United! :))))
Would love to win this ball for my little brother, recently started in a development team for a great academy. Been taking him to goalkeeping practise and training for years now and he loves the game. A great birthday present if I can win it for him! Love the vid. God Bless!
Please ditch the music for videos like this, same song for half an hour is drilling
The ball looks ace
Liverpool champs!!!
I like these predictions
Good stuff Fozzy lad, hope you find a club soon
Well done Frank up the cherries 🍒
I am gutted to not see you in the Prem this season... butt does this mean gopro in goal will return?
Hope your predictions are right Ben, I would love to see Haaland bang in 30+ goals too. Alvarez is going under the radar too which is perfect as I feel he has 20+ goals in him, with the limelight all on Haaland, less pressure for the young lad :) Fantastic Content as always.
You're definitely after going to arsenal aren't you 😂 hope you'll get signed soon Ben surprised you're not after a move to America or something like that.
love it
yo yo yo mr pundit on sky sports next
Love the content 😍 can’t wait for next season there’s gonna be some bangers!
I really hope you get a call from at least 1 of the prem clubs! I would love to have you back at United! Either way up the Cycling GK!!
I'm confused at when he said West ham got to a Europa final.
The prem contracts is gonna come, I BELIEVE
I wonder why you don't rate arsenal though. 🤔  i want a ball though.
Have to agree with a lot of predictions but I think that Tottenham will be higher than Chelsea. Am an Arsenal fan and I hate to say it but Conte is the man and I can see spurs in second place w the players they have and a full preseason under Conte. Their fitness will be immaculate
Fun fact: the team Ole has left has always won the league the year after he left lol
As a fan from Germany I love your videos! Keep up the good content!
Great video!
the goat but still liverpool to win it
I love the vids so much. Rooting for you next season
LIked and here is my comment! Would love one of them for preseason :)
Liverpool fan here. I think spurs are really going to push on this season. Solid signings, depth and conte will have them compact. Really exciting season ahead with united playing good football in pre season, arsenal signing well and intrigued as to what Newcastle can do this year.
For me I think Forrest will have a decent season around 10-11th some good signings been made a good manager and will be one of them teams I feel will take points from a few big teams
Class video ben
Love the vid! Best of luck with the next journey in your career!
I’m surprised you didn’t say how the World Cup could effect the league. Liverpool have players like Salah, Nunez Diaz Robertson all getting a break.
Forest Top 10
1. City 2. Tottenham 3. Liverpool 4. Chelsea 5. Man Utd 6. Arsenal
Another great video. Always love the predictions videos.   If I do win the ball can I be super cheeky and ask for a signature. We would absolutely love to display this in the livingroom. We’re massive foster fans and I missed you last season after the game.  Thanks
I've got Tottenham for 2nd or 3rd... got a feeling they're gonna have a good season
Haaland usually misses 25% of a season due to injury - don't think he'll be scoring 30 goals in under 30 games!
😀class video
What Europa final did West ham get to????????? I was sure it was only the semi
Please come back to your first club ( the mighty Wrexham )
Underrated palace imo
Loved the video except right at the beginning where you predict Liverpool to be 3rd... I don't see us beating City but Chelsea won't get anywhere near us again this year. Nunez will come good, looks exciting in the friendlies just needs that confidence boost with a couple of goals.
Leeds relegated next year I reckon. Leicester had a lot of injuries to deal with last year aswell.
Spurs 4th lol I do not think so
I'd predict the same as you master
I wished you were the prem, but I can't wait for content and the season to start.
Some rogue shouts in there Tbf
the best
Keep up the quality content Ben, hopefully be seeing you in the prem this season.
Be interesting Ben if you changed your mind on Forest now … 70m spent .. lingard on the way … thoughts ?
Big ups the fozcast huge fan from the American Leeds fan! We’ll be back don’t worry fozzy
Liverpool 2
Arsenal making top 4 I can feel it
Hope I win
.
Here for the win
United pre season getting my hopes up
City all the way!
Brighton top 10 again!!!
This is quality content
I think you got it wrong.   1. Man city 2. Liverpool 3. Chelsea 4. Arsenal 5. Spurs 6. United 7. West Ham 8. Leicester 9. Villa 10. Crystal palace 11. Newcastle 12. Wolves 13. Brighton 14. Leeds 15. Brentford 16. Southampton 17. Bournemouth 18. Everton  19. Fulham 20. Nottingham forest
Decent predictions Ben I’d have it similar myself but as ever I’m sure there’ll be shockers 👀 Great vid as ever!!🙌🏻
Absolute legend, would definitely love to see you in the prem again
Very harsh on Southampton, they've only lost two players so far who weren't guaranteed to be starting anyway. Made plenty of promising signings. Don't think they'll be anywhere near relegation!
I’d also appreciate if you can try sign for newcastle!!
Wouldn’t mind the football for a raffle giveaway at where I work…🙏🙏
Up the fozcast 💪
Ben is coming Leeds
Hi Ben
NUNEZ TOP SCORER 🔥
Mufc top 4 🔴⚪⚫🔴⚪⚫
Arsenal jersey love it Ben👏🏻🔥
I think Man Utd will be higher
Similar predictions to me!
Great prediction but united is ending higher👀👀
Great predictions! Wanna get my hands on one of those sick footballs
He never fails to make a good video
great prediction! Really looking forward to this season, I think it is gonna be a really good one to watch.
Man City winning the league again ...
Great content as always! Can't wait to see Ben back in league again next season. SOMEONE SIGN THE MAN
Best YouTuber ever ... my boy Ben!!!
Come on the boys
Love it Ben!
Here are my top 6 predictions. 1. Liverpool 2 Man City 3 Spurs 4 Chelsea 5 Arsenal 6 Man United.
Not sure that bottle between the leg is the most flattering I've seen
United will finish above 6th, screenshot this message.
Benny mate how's your Aussie football skills?
Liverpool going to surprise and WIN IT!
Great vid
Yo not happy with forest prediction hahaha Jesse lingard being linked from realiable sources we are 5 highest spenders in the prem already mate, Brennan Johnson prem ain't ready for him !  super cooper will do a job !
Hope i get the ball
I’d swap arsenal and spurs around
I would like a prem ball
Up the cycling gk🚴‍♂️
Fulham will finish below Forest
With Henderson gone, is Ben going to give United a call to go back to be No. 2 to De Gea?
Great predictions agree with a lot off them a few I’d tweet round but great vid non the less
Hope you get a move settled soon Ben!
Hopefully ten hag wld get them playing his style of football soon enough and we can try for a Europa trophy
I have a gut feeling that Spurs are gonna be 2nd this season, it’s about time
Loving these vids!
Nearly the same predictions haha, hope to see you in the prem again soon!
Overall I agree mostly with you but I think Liverpool will finish 5th. Chelsea 2nd Tottenham 3rd
These videos are great and very enjoyable
I wish you to stay in the premier league
Need the best prem ball from the best prem keeper
Being a spurs fan I'm happy with your predictions. #upthefozcast (in a southerners accent 😜)
As a QPR fan I’m just hoping by 2055 that I can see them on this list 😂😂
Ben Foster to hashtag utd?👀👀
Great video mate! I love a bit of predictions than realising next season how wrong I am, good luck with Watford and the hornets will be back in the prem in no time, come on the boys!
as a city fan, I think you've been very generous to us there! I think 3rd/4th this year. big transition for us, and I think probably a slow start!
hope the cycling gk signs for a ten that he's the number 1 for to see more GoPro in the goal content
Brilliant mate!
I'm not gonna lie mate I'm finding it hard to argue with this list #WorldClass 👌
Great Video Benjamin
Mate you're going to regret the decision you made. Man United 6th. United are going to come out on 3rd place
1 million subs, truly deserved . Such elite commentary. Hi Ben, from Ireland.
Umm… West Ham didn’t get to the Europa League final last season, it’s was Rangers vs Frankfurt
Get yourself to Arsenal! Rambo and Turner could soak up that knowledge!
wolves will go to europe next season.
I'll say it. Whichever team he signed in will be in for a ride, blokes a decent goalie, alright in the prem.  But the social media clout and fans he brings will be insane.  Last year Watford was a neutral's favourite thanks to him (and that 4-1 trashing of Manu).
Cracking work as always boys!
Fair predictions, but I'm hoping you're wrong about the Saints. Would be nice to have some positivity back at St Marys this season.
Wassup Ben!!
Big up Ben. Can you explain your reason why you think Chelsea will come 2nd?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can't wait to lose that beauty in a thorn bush
Keep up the great content, absolutely love it!
saints 18th more like 8th - we haven't lost any players apart from shane long and forster not a big deal - weve signed 6
Hopefully you get a move to a Prem side this year! ❤️
Gl😄
Liverpool third? Lol.. .Do people in the media just hate Liverpool? They are miles ahead of Chelsea... Chelsea have made some good signings, of which, none of them are better than Liverpool players.
Think you’re dropping a hint there that your not currently signed for a premier league team - announcement soon 👀
realistic this time around. Good effort here, hope to see villa in the top 10 though
Lad this is hard to watch... how can you have Chelsea above Liverpool, Tottenham will finish above Chelsea this year...
Love the vids Ben. COYG
Love it Ben, get yourself a contract with a premier league side 👏
" Another Big Boy...Toteneham" 🤣🤣🤣
Good video Ben, I hope you will be back in the prem for this season👊
I reckon Man City will have injuries next season I think they finish 2nd and Liverpool 1st
Gonna miss the Watford Crew, big buzzla... :(
Agree on the Liverpool choice but I think Tottenham will be a force under conte and finish 2nd
great predictions ben, ur forgiven from a bha fan !
I find these Predictions to be spot on, really. You hate to see it, but it would be a miracle for Forest/Southampton to be higher up in the tables, aswell for Brentford, as much as i like them. Mane will be a detrimental loss for Liverpool, but i still see them a little better for a 2nd Place as Chelsea and Arsenal could be a serious contender in my opinion.  All set for an exciting season! I´d love one of those balls to be honest :o
Liverpool should've been first 😤😤
Love the predictions! Great to see Brighton finally get the credit we deserve! Hope to see you in the Prem again soon!
✍?
Siiiiuuuuuuuuu
Hey Ben, my current ball just got punctured, so would be a dream to win such an amazing ball!! Love the podcast btw- keep it up!
I'd love to see you come to Arsenal mate, solid back up keeper and the wealth of experience could take Ramsdale to the next level.
Decent content!
Suiii
i actually think man united will place 3rd, so far we have been playing well in pre season, and we signed lisandro martinez, eriksen, malacia and maybe de jong. And the thing ten hag is doing is that he is signing players that he knows the playstyle too. AND martial and rashy comeback😏😏😏😏
Lovely video ben
Honestly these balls are beautiful, I need one of these
not bad fozzie
The prem seems to get tougher to predict each season! Still think Man United get a bump from actually learning how to play an actual system.
You said Southampton lost players but they haven’t, they’ve only lost Broja who only scored 6 goals for them and that’s hardly a big loss. Plus they’ve signed a load of people and the board have promised at least 1 good striker will be signed as well.
Give me a ball mate
Come on the boys!
Loving the content 🧤⚽️
Hi I would really like to win the ball been following your content for a while and a massive arsenal fan from down under COYG
Anyone else find the music really jarring, going in and out after every prediction..
Nice video Ben, really insightful predictions. We all appreciate the content massively and look forward to seeing you back next season!!!
I think Liverpool might get second this season but Man City will definitely win
That Arsenal top really suited Ben - maybe he should consider signing as a backup keeper? ;)
Love it Ben
Class keeper should be in the prem this season again!
Might be a bit brave but I think Manchester United will SOLIDLY get champions league football and I think they will finish fourth and in the process destroying Liverpool who I think will finish fifth for clarity I think spurs third and Chelsea second and then city in first
Suprised by the Chelsea position, can see them falling out of the top 4 with lack of defensive depth!
Absolutely love cgk, just hoped a prem side would sign him up, wanna see the matchday videos again🥺
Sign for rangers fozzy?
Very interesting predictions! Hope you sign for someone soon be interesting
very solid predictions i think
How people think liverpool will fall off just cause of Nunez is very stupid, yes Mane departure is a big problem but if you look at liverpools games you realise that hes been hiding his numbers behind tap ins mostly. Diaz is a monster and the wing will be covered no doubt, Jota if he gets his chance which i believe he will and play more than Nunez he will score goals and salah is just salah. Nunez tho helps against low table teams who play bunker so alisson hopefully wont be needed to score any goals. Also we saw and will see Harvey, Curtis and now Fabio get the chance to create from midfield which we lacked when thiago was not having a day
Hi I would love to win the ball I need a new ball I have had the same ball from PL 15/16
Nice content as always Ben. Love from Malaysia
ben in an arsenal shirt... wouldn't be a bad bit of business having a character like him in the dressing room
solid prediction
Up the fozzy!
Great video I predict Arsenal to win europa but miss out on champions league
Prediction for where Watford will finish in the championship?
Love the content but this music is such an earrape 🥲
Come to Wrexham
My prediction is Watford to win the Premier League
bha 11th no chace 7th for me
I'm sorry but you are wrong about Manchester United, it's a easy top 3 finish for them, After watching the 3 pre seasons games that have  played I can confidently say that there will be right up there, Before people say calm down its only pre season just take a look at the good football their producing, anyone can clearly see that there is a huge improvement from last season with Ten hag in. A lot of people seem to forget that man utd managed to get a top 2 finish with ole and not to forget that man utd has a lot of great players for Ten hag to work with, what more with a good manager like Ten hag in I know its not going to be easy for UNITED but I know they are going to surprise a lot people this season with the quality football they will be playing soo again its an easy top 3 finish for United for me in my own humble opinion.
That ball would be a lovely birthday present 🤣
Them balls 🥹🥹
Only one i disagree on is Liverpool coming 3rd, i think they’re coming second
The biggest thing about Mitro, in the previous PL seasons for some reason the managers just didn’t play to his strengths and then when they got relegated they would put him back as the first option. This season he has a manager who backs him so it will be interesting to see what they do in the prem
I got almost he same prediction😂
Liverpool and City are still so far ahead of everyone else. I know Liverpool lost Mane but they still got Salah , Diaz, Jota, Firminho and Nunez. I don’t think that’s going to allow Chelsea to gain 18 points. Considering they lost 2 starting CB’s, with one being their best player last season, and still no real ST. Let’s not forget but the 20/21 season when everyone thought Liverpool where finished they still finished above Chelsea that season. When you look at how much they closed the gap on city at the back end of the season because of their depth with Diaz coming in and Elliot coming back and now with Carvalho I expected the depth is going to keep them there. City or Pool will win the league with at least a 10 point gap above 3rd. Which will be Spurs not Chelsea
Liverpool third behave
Awesome nike premier football⚽️ Forest will survive in my opinion… Southampton,fulham and Bournemouth Relegated. Liverpool second
YouTube career full time I hear Ben? Although I reckon some form of GK coach at Man Utd / Arsenal coming your way
Best Keeper in the prem
Would you consider coaching one day ben? Love the work! If insta and youtube accounts are on different emails do give aways not work?
Solid predictions fozzy I agree with your predictions to and loving the new prem balls they look really retro which looks really good , any chance of you coming to Chelsea 🔵🔵🔵 😊
Good Predictions
Sterling at Chelsea to be top scorer I reckon
I want to see Ben in the prem this season
Those balls are sik… I mostly agree with the predictions… although I would swap Forrest and Fulham.
Give me that ball
The United part is true.  Biggest club in Britain so biggest dramas via press and biggest scrutiny/pressure by a long chalk.  Most players, even Liverpool players, may wilt in that spotlight daily. 6th could be right but I see them maybe getting 3rd if things tick
My football at home just got popped by a fox, left without a football now :(
Liverpool have to be 2nd
Up the reds forest 15th this year!
banger as always
Great video fozzie
Hope to see you on the prem fam
Prefer without music
Should be arsenals new backup
When I saw you in an Arsenal shirt I was thinking ‘is this a sign? Is he coming to Arsenal?’ Lol. Where ever you end up you’ll smash it as usual. Keep up the great work Ben and team, love your stuff. Real good insight to what the fans wouldn’t usually see. 😊
Best friggin football content on YouTube although I do think arsenal has a solid chance of squeezing into a champions league position this year ;)
Nice predictions mate!!
Oh man playing with this ball would be absolutely amazing 🤩
These predictions are absolutely rubbish 😂😂😂
Chelsea above Liverpool off your fucking bonce
God damn is that football beautiful
Love your analysis from Australia mate keep it garn
Keep up the great content, Ben!
Here for the ball mate
Brilliant again Fozzy, as a Newcastle fan I think you're pretty spot on, smart signings for us and Eddie Howe is top class. But got to disagree on Palace, I think top 10 for them.  Hope you're signing for someone soon aswell, would love to see you back in the Prem👊 Them new prem balls look world class too!
Love the content and good luck for next season, I think you might have got utds prediction wrong 😉 👆🏻
Quality balls
Ben my Dad Seen you today
Always love the videos on this channel. Great to have a channel for a sports professional 💪
You got to remove the background music man
Top video Ben 😁🙌🏻🙌🏻 can’t wait for this season gonna be big
Love it foz mate
Great video id love to win the new prem ball⚽️🔥
Big up the cycling GK. P.S. can I have one of the balls
Great video as always hope you have a great season keep up the good content.😃⚽️. From L aged 12
Loving the content ben gutted to not see u in The prem this yr
Come on the boys, I wouldn't mind that ball :)
Love the work from you boss! Keep going
now a prediction on which of the clubs you are going to sign for.............................
Would love to see Ben at united
Top quality mate. Gotta have united higher though
Love the content 👌🏼
Need you in my fpl team!!!
Peng Arsenal shirt
Pretty much the same I’d do! Hope to see you playing in a top league next year Ben you friggin legend!
Let’s just hope united surprise us all
Defo think forest will do better than you give them credit for. Great content guys... Keep it up
Gonna be sad to not see Big Bazzler in the vlogs anymore
⚽
I think those predictions arent a bad shout! Great vid!
Chelsea 2nd, take that all day long
Please Ben
I think you’re right about Villa. We are still finding our feet, loosing a manager and key player to then playing new styles of football. Hopefully we’ll be more stable this season
I’m sorry but there’s no way Fulham are staying up 😂 Other than that, solid predictions
Not gonna lie, you have to laugh, too old at 39 !  🤣 Maybe certain cats should join up down the training camp for a Zwift session and a VO2 max bleep test. Then we'll see who's blowin out of their rear end !
"Oooh that's an interesting one"
Can't believe the shit you got on your shirt Ben 😂
Hurry up and come to Leeds mate please
I'm confident Forest can stay up this coming season.  Could possibly do with a couple more players with Premier league experience. If we can get the signing of Lingard over the line that is a huge step in the right direction.
Foster: Palace will have a really good season this year. Also Foster: Places them below where they finished last year 😐
COYH!
Most underrated keeper ‼️
Can't see much wrong with those predictions!
How are Tottenham "big boys" someone explain
Just legend what can I say, awesome lad.
You guys actually think Ben forster replies to these comments and runs this channel 🤣
⚽️⚽️
Up the hornets 🐝
Me and you will finish 11th
Yes Ben love your video  When I watch your videos it always makes my day
yes maaaaaaaaaaate
Nice one mate. Can't quite see Chelsea being 2nd personally as Liverpool are still a fantastic squad. Spurs could be up for it with the investments made
Think you got the UTD prediction wrong. Well let’s hope!
Liverpool bias every year
I think that Liverpool will win and Leeds will come 18th
i agree with most of these picks except i would tip brentford to go down
Lessssssggggggooooo
Love the channel! The Fozcasts are great easy listening keep up the good work guys and hope to see the Cycling GK back between the sticks soon!
West Ham got to the Europa Semi final. Great video though👍
Love the video can't wait to see more of the gk pov vlogs
Yo
Great Video Ben!
nice predictions
Class video lads can’t wait to see what team you sign for next season 👏🏻
What a video. The predictions top class. Can’t wait for the season! ⚽️⚽️❤️
Legends Lads. Fozzie you a massive hero
Wow this is such a poor predicition for villa. 12th?? With the new signings they made. What
Potter great manager so is viera biggest risk both club losing mangers to bigger clubs viera if arsenal have a bad start.  Potter great manager i would have him at england if england have a bad world cup.  Have him at spurs in a heart beat if conte walks.
Great to see you upload on the main channel again, love the Cycling GK crews energy💙
Surely you’ve got a club lined up Fozzy 🙌🏻
You're an absolute legend mate, much love from down under!!
Love this unbiased side coming from a pl player. ❤️❤️
Sad that no prem club likes that much mentality, experience and such a legend in his team! Would be great to see you back on the pitch soon! Thanks for the great video 🙏🏻
Arsenal are going to surprise everyone I think
pressure is on now Fozzy! Liking the predictions!
Still glad that I found this channel keep up the good content mate
Up the Fozcast!
🐐🐐🐐🐐
United top 4. Hopefully Eriksen can add something extra.
New balls look awesome
Great video mate some of the predictions are gonna be miles off though 😂
Good video Ben, wish you were still in the premier league.
I honestly can’t believe no premier league club has approached you yet mate top top keeper
Great predictions I think this will be an improvement from last sessions results
Love to see it fozzy! As a chelsea fan I take that second position. I personally would like to see that forrest would survive. But we’ll see. 🔥🔥
Can’t wait for the premier league beginning 🔥🔥🔥
Chelsea are winning this season I’m telling you
I think villa will be higher personally but that probably my bias 😂😂🙄
I think Fulham goes down and forest stays up. Forest have had an insane window bringing in massive signings who have been proven as good players...
Brilliant video as per usual Ben 🙌
Manu 2nd
Legend
How about shop wasting time and tell us who you signed for. Joking lol can't wait to see who u signed for
hopfully i win
🙌🏻🙌🏻
Background music annoying
Awesome as always Ben. Footballs look sick
Predictions are pretty much the same as mine! 👍🏼 Great video
how can you be a premier league actual player and get it so wrong on Mitrovic? He scored a great amount of goals in his first season with the premier league with Fulham, second year up with them Scott Parker didn't play him (woeful manager) so you cant really count that. Had a similar year to Ivan Toney with Brentford did Mitrovic, in his first year in the PL with Fulham... he's so young you cant measure him off his first year with Newcastle either. Legit, easy analysis if you look beyond basic boring talking points.
Mad how many people still underrate this liverpool team.
Lovely predictions!   p.s.: West Ham had a fantastic season, but weren't in the Europa League final. They reached the semi. ;)
"Europa cups take it out of ya, you're traveling all over the world" not quite sure on this comment Ben.
Up the pod/Ben, hope you find the club of your dreams
Would love to see you play next season but if you don’t sign what’s the content on the channel going to look like?
Loving the content Ben, still hope to see you in a Premier League shirt this season
Giveaway 🤞🏻 great video!
What did Ben do to his head?
Are you gonna play fantasy football this year?
As a Toon fan I’d definitely take a top half finish after the last few years we’ve had!
Shouting out nike while wearing arsenal adidas 😂
Hi Ben, my predictions are: 1. Manchester City 2. Chelsea  3. Liverpool  4. Spurs 5. Arsenal 6. West Ham 7. Manchester United  8. Leicester  9. Wolves 10. Crystal Palace 11. Newcastle  12. Aston Villa 13. Leeds 14. Brighton 15. Everton 16. Nottingham Forest  17. Fulham 18. Southampton  19. Brentford  20. Bournemouth
Gonna miss you in the Prem Ben. But also excited to see what you get up to off the pitch! All the best and cheers mate!
Top class Ben! Love how the majority of us Brighton Fans called you out last season, fair play for taking it all! Much happier with your prediction this season, though I think a top half finish is on again 😉 best of luck mate!
Let's go fozzy
I think man u is going to finish higher bcs ten haag as it seems is doing realy good job with the team, but it depends if Ronaldo stays or not.
Love the vids! Cant wait to see what you do next season. New ball looking amazing!!!
COYW!
Awesome vid Fozzyyyy, hope to see you back in the prem this season!
Nothing better than a Ben Fozzy video in the morning to get your day going! Cross fingers Chelsea can live up to it this season! Going to be a battle!!
Doing a video or two on someone else's channel for a laugh is one thing but having your own YT channel.........I enjoy the content as a football fan but I can see why a top tier club would be put off signing him.
Great video again
Nice one Ben
The givaways are nuts, love you be and i rate the prediction
ben to Arsenal
🙏🏻
Hoping United prove you wrong and maybe get closer to 4th! never know these things! CMON UNITED
would love a ball all mine get lost on the first day🤣🤣🤣
Really like these videos

Always quality content Fozzy!!!
Love your vids Ben. Keep up the great energy.
Mate finding it hard to believe your not signed to a club. But still love the content mate.
Ben absolutly speaking facts about man united
Loved the vid! Always a pleasure to see Tom and Ben having a good time! I think you are wrong on the Forest prediction, but I will let it slide. Cheers to the whole Foz team!
I’l be buzzing with 9th for newcastle fozzy
Decent pridiction

Chelsea  5. Arsenal  6. Leicester  7. Man Utd  8. Villa 9. Westham  10. Newcastle  11. Wolves 12. Brighton  13. Palace 14. Brentford  15. Southampton  16. Forest 17. Everton 18. Fulham  19. Leeds 20. Bournemouth

Can't wait for the season to start, hope you find a new team soon :)
After the nightmare season Everton had, I'd be delighted if we got 14th next season.
Much appreciation from Portugal, Ben. Love your content even though your predictions might be off sometimes 😂 only God knows the future to be fair...
Can’t wait to see where you get signed!
More great vids soon bro this was such a good vid
Love the content! Really hoping you get picked up soon so we can have more match day vlogs!
Love the content! Really hoping you get picked up soon so we can have more match day vlogs!
If villa get 12th the fan base will implode
👍
we miss you at the PL we love you Fozzy
I just want Leeds to do well since they're signing the entire United States
Great predictions minus liverpool winning the prem
I will win it
Honestly gutted that we won’t be seeing you in the Prem next season, you’ve been such an inspiration and hope to see you back in the big leagues soon king 👑
Up the Fozcast 🤘
Another CGK video lessgo
Ben Foster, what do you think of Ben Hamer coming to Watford? Promising for Swansea early in the season, but a few errors and Andy Fisher got the nod there.
love Ben but I think top 6 is gonna be extremely competitive this season everyone will be playing well imo
I can see Brentford finishing 18th- Eriksen a huge loss
Fulham, Bournemouth, and Leeds going down
come on the boysss
Ben w the HEAT Arsenal top on 🔥
Once again another good vid in my opinion and it will be sad to see Ben out prem but still smashing content - good job Ben!
1. Manchester City FC 2. Chelsea FC 3. Liverpool FC 4.Tottenham Hotspur FC 5. Arsenal FC 6. Manchester United FC 7. West Ham FC 8. Leicester City FC 9. Everton FC 10. Wolves FC 11.

Lovely shirt mate COYG
ben can be the goalie of yt all stars😂
Damnnn man united 6th idk...i am thinking 4th if we played how we played the 3 pre season friendly's
Big legend
ben, you’re a bit harsh on the saints.  that’s ok tho.  i like ralph and i like the vision, but it’s not really fruitful is it?  we do play like we are on the beach and i hate that.  i want to see us really play for 9th-13th, so hopefully you are wrong this year!
Up the Fozcast 🙌🏽❤️ Cmon the boyz!
sidemen charity match keeper? 🤔
I think Arsenal will finish 3rd
Would love the prem ball looks absolutely gorgeous, can’t wait to see where your going to be playing next. Love from Australia Fozzy
What a legend we’ve got, keep it up Ben! Can’t wait to see you on your new club!
Liverpool will win the League
Flash in an Arsenal kit is cursed 😳
i think leeds will get 11th this year personally, all there signings look great
Ben you are a Legend mate
❤️❤️
Thanks for creating all these videos! Come on the boys!
I’d love to see Ben join Arsenal as a backup keeper, he’s great for morale & those youtube videos are worth a contract alone 🙏
Pls pick me Ben I hope chelsea can do the exact opposite of your predictions this year and go up instead of down
Wait, what was his final score?
wish we could see you in the prem again mate but hell of a ride. keep it up with the vids!!!!
i want ball
It’s a shame that we won’t see you in the prem next season, I’m a city fan, but you and your content have put a soft spot in my football heart every time I saw you on tv. Hope we can see more GoPro content in the future! Video liked, subscribed,  commented, and heading to the insta page to support the nicest keeper in the prem. Love you fozzy
cracking prediction ben
pass me the ball big ben!!
I agree with most of your predictions
not 'currently signed for a premier league team'      some news incoming Benny?
IMO Tottenham will win the EPL
I feel like Chelsea will close the gap between them and Liverpool but Liverpool just have so much talent and will finish second again this season.
It is to early for a prem prediction
United top 4
Ben I honestly think city and Liverpool are going to bottle the league
To be far I wouldn’t change much about your predictions Foz. I reckon you’ll do pretty good with those.
Absolutely love the content and miss the gopro in the goal content huge love and respect for what you do
Fulham is gonna surprise everyone this season
At least we predicted to stay up this season🤦🏼‍♂️😂
Manu are looking very sharp in the pre season. I hope your 6th prediction will be wrong. I think they will finish 3rd or 4th.
To say you have been a premier league keeper you are clueless
I have been a fan of you for as long as I remember your by far one of my favorite footballers and always will be. Keep it up It would mean the world to have that match ball. Thank you for entertaining us all Gmail cennorsearl10@gmail.com
The top 6 is going to be nutty this season! City will most likely pull away early but the likes of ManU, Tottenham, Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea. It’s going to be tight!! I also think Everton are going to place 17th!
Predictions are pretty accurate, some are… ehhh but not bad.
Love you Ben but you chat some absolute b0llox
Hope to see you in the league next season! Started watching because of you and kept up with watford all year
W
how Liverpool 3rd but I can see why you put Liverpool 3rd but I can't see Chelsea topping Liverpool.
Ben the absolute goat entertaining as always
UNCLE BENNNNNNNNNNY
Accurate premier league table
Man city are obviously the team they are staying up top. Love your videos mate
Get in the comment
Not a bad list that mate..
Can u do other leagues like Bundesliga and LaLiga predictons?
Would really love one of the balls
relegation spots very difficult to pick this year in my opinion
Some of those picks like Liverpool in 3rd is gonna age like milk.
West Ham didn’t reach Europa final it was Rangers v Frankfurt
Chelsea above liverpool is madness, they have got rid of two of there CBS and Kante has been on the downward for 12 months, Liverpool have added solid players and they will be the only team come the end of the season that battle with city, people put liverpool 4th last season as well, and they just never learn, there’s no evidence that liverpool don’t do really well again this season, mane leaving for opposition fans or people that don’t watch him week in week out think it’s a lot worse then it is, he’s seen his best years and it was time for him to leave.
Hi Ben going to miss those weekly premier league game videos, from Australia 🇦🇺
Did you forget bout Everron losing their best player
What kit is that
Solid understanding of the strengths each team showed last season. I hope United follow their preseason form and surprise you a bit though!
Great content as always!
Just waiting for you to sign for someone cant wait to follow the next step in your career
Chelsea all the way mate!!
TOP 6 Man city Arsenal Liverpool Chelsea Tottenham United  Bottom 6 Villa Everton Leeds Bournemouth Fulham Nottingham forest  My top 6. People may think i'm nuts, but hear me out. Liverpool are looking touch and go and their gas is definitely going. Good players in, but without the roation of Mane, you are looking at a very different Liverpool. Chelsea, I just dont think will get the best out of Sterling and will inevitably have no proper striker upfront unless they buy someone. I just think alot will happen with them this season. City is City. Tottenham will underperform and I feel something will happen with Kane/Son ie Injury or crazy transfer (Bayern are sniffing around and Kane could easily just have one last hoorah) and United i'm being generous. Could care less for Dutch managers and genuinley think they will struggle more than last season. They'll have a bounce early on but will inevitably drop off later on really badly, thus why I belive Ten haag will be gone by Febuary.   As a Wolves fan, idkw, but I feel, without a shadow of a doubt, Arsenal will shock the league this year. Year on year improvement, constant ignorance to their ability to go forward and with the right additions, especially with who they have signed, I really think they'll shock the world. Jesus will do incredible for them, Zinchenko will do incredible for them and, IF their team can stay fit, especially their full first team, Tomiyasu, Tierney, Gabriel, White/Saliba, Partey, (Need another CM next to him that is better at football than Xhaka and they also need a winger for roation, Saka etc they just have the exact same mixture that leicster had during their titles winning season. Perhaps not the most star studded squad, but the unity and togetherness of their squad is just something else. Wolves will probably get to around 9th.  Whats your top and bottom 6 ?
As an Nufc fan top 9 would be very good for us
Come on the boyyysssss. Actually you still need a club Ben🤣🤣
Can't see forest being relegated with the transfer window they have had to be honest.
Nice predictions but I say Villa much higher.
Villa top 10 for me.
Sad to not see foz in the prem, but if he stopped playing, would love to see him coach with such great experience.
Would love a new football mate!
What a legend
Love it!! Hope you find a new club for the upcoming season. 🔥🔥⚽️
Git up
1. City 2. Liverpool  3. Chelsea 4. Spurs 5. United  6. Arsenal 7. West ham 8. Leicester  9. Newcastle 10. Wolves 11. Aston villa  12. Brighton 13. Palace 14. Everton 15. Brentford 16. Southampton  17. Leeds 18. Nottingham Forrest 19. Fulham 20. Bournemouth
When he said Liverpool will be 3rd because "they have a bit  of a transition period"  from losing Mane, who else waited to see him inevitability contradict himself with 1st or 2nd spot. 🤣
Would love to win looking for a match ball for ages
You are the best YouTube and goalkeeper ever and you shud be number one and I love are YouTube because it makes me feel amazing lack you ❤
Top vid as always
Oh benny foster come Leeds will u pal needing a keeper son
Nice one
Great video as always. Would be great to see you sign for a prem team. Good luck
Arsenal to the top!
Love it
As a forest fan I do hope we get higher than 19th but it will be a struggle
Come to the MLS maybe then I'll go to a game u are the only reason I got into watching "soccer" Football.
love ya ben
Idk why but this vid is getting me ready to see the fantasy team updates on the vlogs 👌🏻💛
Hello lad nice vid
Great content as always, shame we wont see you in the prem this season. Keep up the good work
Lmao all the united salty fan disliking the video for 6th 😂😂😂
Please
Cycling gk just dont disappoint.. hands down the best channel on youtube! However I disagree with united finishing 6th, TOP 4 IT IS.
Love it but think united should be higher!
Great video as always, think Spurs will surprise you this season 😉
Villa top 10 for sure!
As much as I'd love to agree with Frank The Editor's comments on The Mighty Chezzas I really do think its going to be a tough old season, although I truly believe there are 3 worse teams than us. UTCIAD.
Liking the shirt Ben
Love the vid, good predictions there
Sign the contract at West Brom
love the vids
Hoping🤞🤞
New era footballs are hard?, mate has ya mate ever kicked a Mitre Multiplex?, 😂😂😂
Arsenal 3rd for me transfer window gonna be mad I’m tellin ya
HWTL
Great vid guys, Happy with your Chelsea prediction 💙😂🙌🏼
Ben I know your training at the albion please sign for us give us another season or 2 you’d be our number 1 keeper get the good times rolling again lad come on you know you want to
2 guys that I could listen to for daysss!!!!!!
Coyg
Love the podcast mate! Brighton top 10 though 👌 😃
I would like a ball please
I think top 3 will be close between city, lfc and spurs. I think spurs will be the dark horses. Contes a proven winner when he cam get the players he wants. Despite the loss of mane i think klopp will lead Liverpool to be title contenders irrespective of whether or not nunez adapts straight away. And city is obvious. Already champions and they have the best CAM in the world in KDB and arguably the best ST in the world in Haaland.
LFC all the way❤️
Legend
Manchester United taking a champion league spot🤞🏽
Amazing prediction! Loving the Chelsea in second
🙏🙏🍀
Love your vids always feels good to be on the pitch with your view as a goalkeeper 🔥🔥🔥💯 great positivity you give your teammates
Go on
Up the fozcast!
No Ben don't right bournemouth off 😞
“Cmon the boys” 🙏 two legends!
Ben Foster Neville Carragher Keane Richard’s…..He has got the personality and occasional grit to be in that studio.
Love it Fozzy!!! Great to have you back. Also loved the midweek waffle podcast 😂
Love the videos and the podcast Ben. Thanks for the quality content you provide 🙂
Loving the content, and more importantly living the shirt, top notch!
Great prediction hope you go  to the premier league next year
This will be an exciting season!!👏🏻
Get me one of them balls on a 5aside pitch Monday night perfect
Huge fan Ben, also a goalkeeper myself, you are an inspiration.  Keep up the wonderful videos! 👏
Friggin Ledge
Hmmmm don’t thing Leeds and leister should be where they are Leeds have had a bad transfer window with that release of Phillips and leister are just too over rated also FOREST at 19th? Come on Ben
He should go to Man United as a back up. Probably earn 70K a week. More than his 33K a week at Watford
I’d love to win a ball
I feel like many forget that Forest beat arsenal and Leicester last season and contested Liverpool. Yes it will be tough but we have shown we can challenge. Good vid tho fozzy
Love watching your channel Ben!! I’m a aspiring young goalkeeper playing in the USA with the hope and dreams of playing in leagues such as the premier league!! I am working really hard every day and I also have my ups and downs. I hope I’m able to watch you in the premier league or any other league this up and coming season. And all the be to find a new team! Keep up the content!
I agree with Ben than Man United aren’t urgent enough in the transfer market and always have that added pressure and expectation. Hopefully tho he’s incorrect in his prediction and we finish higher up
Love it Foz
I think ben is the perfect GK for southampton right now but i also could see him at ajax. I also think vardy x maddison will be a dangerous duo this season
what watch is he wearing ?
Great video! Gonna be a decent season! Agree with the top four but Liverpool ahead of Chelsea still for me
What club are you going to
Come on foster
i see no reason for chelsea to place higher than liverpool
Where will you sign
W
21 is coming
Nice one
forrest staying up steve cooper mots
You said Liverpool 4th last season came second by 1 point,this season 3rd so that means we'll win it by 20 points this season 🤘🏻👍🏻
Hope I can win that ball 🙏🏻
Ben is killing it. I'm new to the premier league as of last year but an absolute pleasure to watch
Shame you don’t believe in the mighty reds coming up to the prem us forest boys will be a surprise Ben trust me I’d happily get Steve cooper to grab you to come play for us mate ❤️⚪️🔴
I think spurs get 3rd #coys
Hey dude, how is finding a club going? Been keeping an eye out on news for you, hope you're well
Bournemouth 17th surely
I really don't see chelsea finishing above liverpool. Doesn't make sense considering chelsea has lost alot of key players.
i Really think Liverpool will not even challenge man city this year, i think they'll still come top 4 easy but Man city will completly dominant. losing Mane is huge and im notsure Nunez will be world class yet...
let's see city winning the ucl this season
Mckennas at the wheel
Think you are wrong about Liverpool.
Great vid, I’m loving that prediction for Chelsea👌🏻
Pretty solid prediction mate. Keep up the good work!
Good predictions, think there maybe a few shocks this year but can't call who just yet.. Hope to see you at a prem club this year and 🤞 its at Arsenal as think you'd be a great influence of Ramsdale, Turner and the other young keepers at the club.
Can't see City not winning the league. Hope Newcastle get relegated, cos, boooooo!
Would love a ball to give to my bro for his bday. Just his thing.
arsenal got 4th foz :) promise!
1st: Manchester City 2nd: Liverpool 3rd: Tottenham Hotspur 4th: Chelsea 5th: Arsenal 6th: Manchester United 7th: West Ham United 8th: Leicester City 9th: Brighton & Hove Albion 10th: Crystal Palace 11th: Wolverhampton Wanderers 12th: Everton 13th: Newcastle United 14th: Aston Villa 15th: Southampton 16th: Brentford 17th: Bournemouth 18th: Leeds United 19th: Fulham 20th: Nottingham Forest
Upthefozcast
Love the content
Get CGK in the prem
LOVE IT MATE!!!! Please comeback to United <3
Liverpool at 3th? Sorry ben but that’s way wrong. They Will win 100%
Deadset, one of my favourite channels on YouTube lads . Content just gets better and better . All the best for the season Ben. Hope to see you in the prem!
Deadset, one of my favourite channels on YouTube lads . Content just gets better and better . All the best for the season Ben. Hope to see you in the prem!
Can't wait to see who you sign for!!
why are we always underestimated in predictions🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I said the exact same position for Newcastle
looking from transfer window so far, I think forest might surprise some people this year. Don’t think they’ll do unbelievable but I back em to stay up
Why are you wearing a Woolwich Jersey
Eesh, that is such a vanilla prediction 😂
Always good content! Love from Sweden.
Hi ben!
United are going to either smoke it and be back best of the rest in the top 4 or be still miles off but think we win something atleast this year
Your prediction last season made our wins all the more enjoyable..  Brighton fan.. :)
Love it Ben. Another banger. United bringing it home tho 🤪
What a video this was, glad to hear that you think city are wining the league ;)
Always good videos mate keep it up 💪🏼
Great vid!
Bournemouth never getting relegated 🍒🍒
Could this jersey cameo be hinting at your next move??
Much better predictions I think this year Ben can see Leicester and spurs being the dark horses this year
As a spurs fan I would love to see them finish 4th. The signings they have made have been amazing
Love you ben. Keep up the good work in the championship ❤️
Interesting
Interesting
Man Utd should sign you again to backup De Gea with Heaton
What a video. I'm thinking that table prediction is pretty much on the mark.
you should get signed by a club. you are amazing
Mate, I agree with Bournemouth and Southampton...but instead of Forest I fear for Brentford
Up the Fozcast 💪
You are the legend
Buzzing for the new season to start can't wait to see what the new signings are capable of
Nice video Ben
Awesome video as always 👌
Will miss you in the PL next season, but at least we won't miss the entertainment here:)
Can you turn down the backing music please its distracting
bloody hell
Some good calls there Big Ben🙌🏻
Think forest will surprise a few teams next season great turn around last season and what a way to finish by winning the playoffs! Looking forward to the season especially because of the transfers so far! Haaland is a massive coupe for city goals galore!
come on the boys need a new ball for the new season 😍
Protien bor
Have a chat with Mr Bruce and come back to the Baggies mate! Sam Johnston left and seems like a gap is there to be filled!
Some cracking little predictions
Yess Fozzyy!!
14th is sound for us we aren’t expecting miracles. We just expect survival
you have no idea what you're in for mate. we are staying up. you reds!!!
Yes Ben another banging vid hope,  you find a club and can enjoy playing football and possibly a cheeky go pro in the goal 😜.
How are Chelsea second?
You friggin legend!!
I got 56 points then for last season - a valiant effort 👍😅
Honestly think these predictions are pretty accurate with a lot of similarities to mine. Another class video Ben
https://youtu.be/OnfGJRzz1Q8 ( real madrid explained)
Great predications Ben, will be awkward if Bournemouth come in for you now🤣
Spurs 3 Chelsea 4
You over inflated the ball. FIFA give out a guidance. And 95% of people over inflate. A ball is supposed to bounce off of your foot to a point. Most inflate a ball, where by it feels like your trying to control a brick.
Love it Benjamin ❤️
I win this ball
Chelsea 2nd 😂😂😂😂😂
Despite the Blues connection 😉,  I was hoping the villa would get you in!
arsenal top 4
Hey Ben!
Interesting to see where you’ll be playing next season
COYG
What a video!! 😍😍 city defo gonna win the league with haaland and Alvarez, but we are gonna still chase up and Darwin to get 15 plus goals. Good prediction and very accurate i think!
Yes think Forest could stay up
Pretty sure West Ham went out in Europa semis boys 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
Hi great videos, keep it up
Protein bor
I need that ball…
Loving the content
Can't wait till the end of the season to see the results 😂
Tottenham will win a trophy this year
Come back to blues
Youtube suits you so well, but i hope that you play at least three more season mate. Which club, thats a real question :D
Forest have spent 60m so far so I’d have Fulham and Forest swapped but other than that I completely agree with this
Please stop with the music in the background
Faith in Forest🥰
Can’t wait to see how we (Newcastle) get on this season like, real sense of believe in the toon right now! P.s. absolutely love them new prem balls 😉
The 🐐
Foster likes marsch,,,, join us then !!!!
U gotta remember, prem players are very expensive,,, and foreign players are good
Love the prediction I would put Arsenal 4th though with the signings they are making
Love the vids Ben! Come sign for whitecaps FC
I don’t think you will be far off with this prediction.
RIP eardrums
So here for that ball, no H
Where can I get his Arsenal shirt?  Edit: Adidas x Stella McCartney 🔥
It’s such a wonderful world that Man U aren’t in the top 4. Love it 😂
Solid predictions there mate
Liverpool 1st np
lovely video and what a ball, would like one myself:)
Legend
come to arsenal ben
I reckon 7-15 is going to be so interchangeable this season. Hopeful Manchester United fan let us finish above arsenal 😂😂😂
Hope you pick me!
Come to Leeds lad.
Please keep doing match days so we can follow your journey back to the premier league 🤩
Hoping Leeds can stay up again this year. Squad looks a lot different.
Liverpool in third haha you lot are embarrassing
Hello Ben
Come on the boys
Chealsea 2nd is bold
Great content as usual guys. Keep it going ✌🏻✌🏻
Hope to see the cycling gk back in the prem this year
Glad to see your not buying into the silly media stuff on Newcastle of saying we Guna be high up etc etc but I’m happy with mid table for us tbf solid season
Forest close to signing lingard tonight aswell
Friggin ledge
Ben the Legend
Gets Watford relegated then does his 2022/23 prem predictions wearing an arsenal top 😂😂 Jesus Christ
Hope to see you between the posts this season. 👍
Never owned a Premier League Ball
Wait is Ben retired?? I know he left Watford but haven’t seen him be linked with a club yet
Great to see you Ben ❤
I’d love one of those balls. They look wonderful. So excited for the new match ones
Love to see you in the prem next year!!!
Another banger
Arsenal top 4 is a must
Argh, turn the background music off!
Definitely feel villa will do better, just need that confidence and we will smash it
Plsss I didn't ever have a premier league football and can I have one youll probably say no but I subscribed and liked
i'd take 9th for Newcastle top ten will do us 👍⚫️⚪️⚫️⚪️
Come to Liverpool and take karius' spot. We still got him?
Surprised Liverpool weren’t 1st or 2nd in your predictions after the last few seasons. Will be interesting to see how this year plays out!
Class as ever 👏🏻
Shame we won't be seeing you between the sticks in the prem this upcoming season Ben absolutely love your content and little like behind the scenes kinda vlogs and love how generous you're with you give aways going to give it a shit at winning to hopefully win it for my little sister she's obsessed with football and would love a Premier league football so 🤞 but good luck all whoever wins will be getting a graat football/prize
Do a fpl video. Love your vids
Fulham stay up!! (Also the balls this year are sick)
I think you’ll be surprised by Southampton gone back to the old ways of signing players best talent and players that suit them, also have a feeling that spurs might even win the league I just have a feeling. Great content Ben
I think Haaland has a bit of injury problems. If City can figure that out they will be hard to beat. But I think the best battle will be 3-6. I have City then Liverpool in first and second. Then a super tight race between Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham and United. I hope United can get 3rd or 4th but my head says they get 5th.
I fancy spurs for 2nd this season. Whole season with conte and some great signings, I think they could be ones to watch
The disrespect on liverpool predictions every year is ridiculous
“shoutout to Nike” wearing an arsenal kit made by adidas 😂
great predictions
Hi
I have the org  miter ball from the 90s...
Hello from North Carolina USA
Going to miss you in PL...
For me Forest are the only promoted team staying up, I think this might be the year Southampton finally go down. Also, a bit of a wild shout, I think Wolves are really gonna struggle this season and could get dragged into a relegation battle.
Ben, get to leeds,,,, NOWWWW 🧊🧤🧊
banging video
Great content Ben. Wish we could see you play in the prem this year. Love your content and predictions... I agree with them. Keep it up big man!
Come on Ben. Arsenal above united behave. United look more improved and a better manager
Wrong about man united sorry lad
Up the chez 🍒 even tho our lack of signings is worrying, we will prove everybody wrong again like we did 4 times in a row the last time we were in the prem and only going down by a point in the 5th season. Scum, Leeds and Forest to go
🧤🔥
Top video as always 🙌🏽
I do think Forest will do better than that with all the new signings and with Steve Cooper at the helm. I wouldn't like to prediction which position though but I expect good football.
I really hope we can see a camera in the goal this season! Even if it’s the MLS 😉
Great video Ben, really enjoy your content.  As a Fulham fan, I'm delighted to see you think we'll be safe..just.
Oi Oi
Yes fozzy
It’s a little sad to not see you this starting season
Would love to win one og the next prem footballs. Wouldn’t hurt to give to a fan from Overbroad👍😄
Much love from America
Very nice prediction, love to hear your reasoning behind them as well. I would personaly bump Wolves 2 places down, Brighton and Aston villa one up. I would switch notingham and Bournemouth and would also switch Leeds and Brentford (last one may be a bit biased as i'm a Leeds fan)
Hope I win one of the match balls😅
United signing Martinez & Erickson, i believe they have a chance for top 4, it’ll be hard with Arsenal & Spurs making big signings but you never know
I think you Are right with everything exept Arsenal and Tottenham. Arsenal 4th and tottenham 5th
Saints 😇 won’t go down ,it’s going to be Bournemouth,Notts Forrest and Fulham
⚽️⚽️👏🏼
Love the content mate really getting me through the heatwave. As a Liverpool fan hope we can challenge for the title again this season.
I think under ten hag united will improve and I see a 5th place finish. Great video mate. U never disappoint with you talks and predictions. Can’t wait to know what your next club is.
siu
Unreal ball that ⚽️
Great vid 👌🔥
Such an underrated ball
Hoping to see you back between the sticks soon 🧤🔥🥅 loving the content
Graham Potter is an outstanding manager
Chelsea at 2nd is a weird shout. We will see...
Great video once again Ben. Keep up the great work!
Can' t wait the PL season to start!!
I don’t agree with Chelsea finishing second
Hope it’s not too late to see you in the prem. Deadline day move for ya fingers crossed lad
Great content Ben, always good to watch your videos, unfortunately you wont be playing in the premier league next season but I’m sure the content will still be great. Will we see go-pro in the goal next season like we seen the other season
Hope Forest can stay up but it's gonna be tough. Come on You Reds!
Tbh, I think being placed 14th ain't bad, considering the season we just had.
What happened to his forehead?
Lets gooooooo!
You underestimate LFC again Ben
Spurs are taking second this yr! COYS
Ben where you going this season
you said you fear for Southampton but I'm not convinced by wolves they look completely dry in front of goal and something needs to happen
More vids pls, ben. Great content btw 😍👏🤝
Keep up the good content👍
Massive predictions, fair play Ben! C'mon the boyz
Enjoyed every single video m8 keep it up, hopefully you get to a team you enjoy good luck
Banger vid!
Love your energy!
Amazing
loving the videos keep up the good work. you inspire me to keep being the best keeper i can be
I would say Ben is going to be quiet alright this year with his predictions. As always top video 💪
Not sure if i've forgiven you for putting us 18th last year, but fair play for holding your hands up! Fingers crossed you get a good contract at a decent club next term.
Me and some friends have done a season prediction. Looking forward to seeing the results at the end!
HOW has Fozzy not got a prem club offer yet?!
Arsenal have signed a new GK mate. You might do well do wear a ManUtd or NEW top instead. Friggin legend.
With all the signings united have made, the potential of de jong coming in and our pre season form I can confidently say we're coming in the top 4 this season Still some really good predictions from the legend himself❤
Ben showing he’s united routes with he’s Liverpool predictions every year
Love the content Ben ⚽️
Chelsea 2nd Ben seriously not Liverpool or spurs anyway love this kinda content
What a friggin legend!
The only things I would change here is swap Chelsea and Liverpool and Fulham and Nottingham Forrest.
I think man utd is gonna get 4th with the style of play from erik they are gonna be the suprise of the uncoming year tbh
Think you got Chelsea too high seeing how half their defense is leaving..  Man City. Liverpool. Arsenal. Chelsea. Tottenham.
United in 6th Are you crazy ?
This would be amazing if I won and I could do with a new ball
Forest is really interesting to me. They signed quite a few guys that I’d be excited about. Richards, Awoniyi, etc. Leeds is as well. I watch the Bundesliga quite often and I think Roca is a good signing. Not sure if it’s enough for them to stay up but I’d not be surprised if they’d both manage to do so.
Chelsea going to surprise a few this year, placed them well Ben.
Hey Ben, really loving the Arsenal shirt there 😂 great video, interesting predictions with Chelsea snubbing Liverpool tho! Keep up the good work pal and all the best in your next endeavour x
Yes mate 👍
Ben foster, secret gooner🔴🔴🔴
loving the content Ben keep it going mate  🙌🙌
Absolute legendary content! Would love a new ball going into university!
Come to Villa Fozzy! UTV!
Come on Fozzy - get yourself a club and do what you do best,
Ben in an Arsenal shirt...free transfer incoming? 🤔
Was gonna buy one of these balls but winning a match ball would be even better. Hope your prediction for Southampton doesn’t come true!
Oooooh lovly kit there Ben...
What’s the chances I had to wait all the way until the end
City and Liverpool all the way nip and tuck. Spurs will be a strong 3rd 10 points behind the others. Chelsea 4th as they still don't have player capable of 20 goals a season
Would love to have you at Leeds, your personality would be brilliant in that dressing room.
I think Forrest will survive
I did everything you said to enter
One of the biggest underrated players of this generation
Come to Feyenoord!!
I would be happy with top 10 but who knows 👀🙏
Ben you have absolutely smashed the YouTube scene. Love the content especially when even doing collabs with other people. 🔥
I think your very optimistic with Chelsea. Were in the race with arsenal and spurs at the back end last season and imo have had a worse transfer market than both of them. I see them battling it out for too 4 again. Another great vid
Arsenal 5th!? 4th place for me
come home fossy , the albion fans would love you to finish your amazing career at the hawthorns... whatever the case best of luck you legend aha
Love the predictions, think they will be pretty spot on with a few minor changes
Leeds United will be fighting from day 1 for survival,too many crucial injuries and lost the glue that held them relegation looking likely. Bournemouth will have to weather the first games after that they will survive number 13
Sign for Sunderland Ben 👍
Another crackin’ vid from the lads
I think liverpool will win the league this season
Loving your predictions Ben. ⚽ 👏 🥅
Your gonna be so wrong about united. Legend though
Come on fosterrrrrrr ❤️❤️❤️
I don’t think Southampton will go down! Fulham, Brentford and forest I reckon. Agree with city winning the title again!
Hi Ben, a few days ago I was listening to Talk Sport with Simon Jordan and they say that you were fined because of your Go Pro camera, can you tell us something about it. tnx....best of luck
What a video from you Ben
Wearing an Arsenal kit, love that from you
Soton to survive imo
I think Liverpool will finish higher not gonna lie
At the start of the vid u say Liverpool are in transition and put us 3 rd not watched all the way through but whoever u put second are in a bigger transition period than us Chelsea spurs united
Seagulls
I agree with most of these predictions actually the top ten are all really good predictions I would have put villa 11 and Brighton 12
New prem balls look class 🥵
PLeaSe dO A chAmPIonSHiPs
I’m in disbelief United is put at 6th… That was just their worst performance in history last season and you really think they’re going to repeat that??
Great predictions there you frigging legend. Would be great to see the final points total for last seasons predictions, so it's easier for you to compare year on year!
Those balls look sick! (I need to work on my phrasing...)
Love the format of this compared to a lot of other predictions and as an Arsenal fan love seeing Ben in an Arsenal top. Hope to see you sign with someone soon!
Chelsea will never finish higher than Liverpool
I love yours videos be 👍keep them up
Yo
the balls r rlly expensive so lucky!!
Exciting to see what will become of your predictions next season, but the main thing I want to see is you playing in the premier league
Forest top 15
👍🏼
Ben, great consistent content as always. Keep smashing it!
Absolute (ball)er
I'll take 7th after last year😂
Oh Ben, I'm very disappointed. P.S We nose-dived around about March time.
Ball 2 Sweden please!🇸🇪
I think I agree with your predictions. I will do my own later with my fam but this looks promising. Only for it to come smacking you in the face in May
I want the ball really badly my dad wants it and we can not buy it Bec it is to much for us to buy it for him so pls can I win the ball
That ball looks very cool!
Big predictions from you mate, I hope you and your team come back next season to the premier league Goodluck
Nah Ben. Forest coming top 10 mate
west ham will win the premier league. 100%.
City for the treble!!!!
Leeds will surprise a few i think this season
Love the content mate always a great time when you upload. You bunch of friggin legends honestly
I think it’s Liverpools time
'I got no skin in the game'! Whilst he wears an Arsenal jersey! lol!
Let's go Fozzy!
class lads! Buzzing for this season, hoping for higher than 8th for the hammers!
Class
Newcastle so low? Wait see at the end of the season.
Best football player who does YouTube what a lad
liverpool will stay 2nd i think
Come on mate. Liverpool have signed one player who will make the first team squad but you think we’re going through a transition. You put chelsea above us who have signed how many players? They’re going to look so different and 100% going through a bigger transition
Lovely vid. Prediction may be a bit off tho
We have the same top 5, I think if Ronaldo stays Man United can be at 6, but if he leaves I see them being 8-10
Hi Ben just wanted to say thanks for all the content and I love how you have given all the football fans worldwide exclusives and go pro content . Just wanted to say thanks and hope I can potentially win the ball ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ much love and keep up the great work ❤️❤️❤️
Ben what are you doing mate??? Can't be wearing Arsenal shirts 😂😂😂
👍⚽️
love the videos! need to find this man a club should of signed for us instead of getting ortega 😭
Why you wearing that dusty kit Ben
Epic doing a Nike sponsorship wearing Adidas hahaha
im an arsenal fan but i think man utd are a bit low, they are playing great football beating liverpool and palace, i think top 3 for them perhaps
I wanna win a ball
It will be between Liverpool and City as always...
JOIN LEEEEEDS!!
Top guy ngl
Liverpool in transition because we’re replacing one player yet Chelsea replacing half their team and they’re gonna finish second 😂
Loving the vids absolutely banging
Tottenham are winning the league
😍
Huge fan! Would love to have a premier league ball. Love the vids. Keep up the good work.
Great vid fozzy but think nufc needs to be in the European spots ⚫️⚪️
great video once again Ben 👍
For me the top 6 are gonna be City Liverpool ManUnited Spurs Chelsea West Ham think arsenal having Europe will hurt them and last years no Europe and no cup runs given them a flattering league finish
yeye
From an Everton supporter I have to say… I’ll bite your arm off for 14th😂
Someone give Ben a contract, ridiculous a keeper of his quality isn't signed to a club right now. Brings great keeping, great bants and someone to look up to!
W
Watching Tottenham on a Wednesday night, you play Thursday cos you're f'ing sh*te
From this video I can confidently say that Ben is moving to Everton. How has he got them in 14th
very interesting picks fozie! I‘m very excited about next years premier league because of all the transfers! Thank you for your brilliant podcasts and videos
Love the video Ben keep it up
Hi
I like your predictions and I love the videos
the league is for liverpool even tho am an aston villa fan
That’s a beautiful ball if I’ve ever seen one
Haaland to win the golden boot this season?

My guy Ben fosters great video ✌️
UP THE BORO… I mean FOZCAST! 😉
City better do the double!!!
I wouldn’t place wolves higher than palace
Foster I have no words to say how much you inspire me. We will miss you as a fellows Watford fan. Still going to support you though. You friggin legend
Keep up the work ben wish I got to watch you in the prem again this year!!
Those have to be the best prem balls for a long time
Completely baffled as to why so many people think Chelsea will improve on last season with a weaker team
Ben you friggin legend, great vid mate!
Cycling GK with another banger of a vid. Could sit and watch these for hours on end
Hopefully you get signed for a team this summer. If not I’m gonna miss the match day vlogs
👍🏼 decent predictions

Oi oi, Ben you bloody legend. Hope you find a good club next season. Good luck mate have a good one.
You gunna be a gunner? 😏
Content is always great you lads! Justification for each teams prem predictions are solid. Loving Chelsea at 2nd as I am a blues fan🔵  Can’t wait to hear which club you will be at next season. Hoping it’s the prem as the ball is 🔥. If not would not be bad to see you join Bale at LAFC for the US move.
Come on the boys
My predictions are  20. Fulham 19. Bornmouth 18. Brentford 17.Nottingham Forest 16. Leeds  15.Brighton  14. Southampton  13.Everton 12. Palace 11. Newcastle  10.Wolves  9. Leicester  8. West ham 7. Aston villa 6. Tottenham 5. Arsenal 4. Chelsea 3. Liverpool 2. United 1. City

Love the content Ben great to see a players perspective!
Forest won’t be getting relegated Ben 😉
Fozzy get your self to the SPFL 😁
Teams who haven’t been in the Prem for a long time or never been there seem to do well for the 1st season. Look at Brentford, Sheffield United, Brighton, Swansea to mention a few. Whilst teams who bounce back after one or two seasons tend to struggle. Why do you think this is?
HAALAND
Fingers crossed for the ball 🤞
USA FAN!!! COME ON YOU GUNNERS!
Nike inspired by Mitre…
Prem predictions   1. Man city  2. Liverpool 3. Spurs 4. Chelsea 5. Man united 6. Arsenal 7. Leicester 8. West Ham 9. Newcastle 10. Villa 11. Wolves 12. Palace 13. Brighton  14. Leeds  15. Everton  16. Fulham 17. Southampton  18. Forest 19. Brentford 20. Bournmouth
Love the videos Ben  Hope to see ya in the prem next year 👍
Am i the only one who cant see the post that hes pointing to at the end? I think its a nice prediction and cant wait for the new season to start and hopefully see Ben at a team soon.
Regardless of the year outcome, I hope we get to see you playing for someone in the league. That's all I care about right now
Fff
C'mon you Wolves! A big season incoming. Would love one of them Nike Flight balls!
I'm an American United fan and they've been "my team" since I was a little kid and I live in Texas where the Dallas Cowboys (NFL) rule with an iron fist. Like you said, when United lose, everyone melts down and I actually see a lot of similarities between United and Cowboys fans in that regard. When all goes well, the fans think we'll win it all, but when we lose the very next game, "Omg, we'll never win another championship."
Think you’ve put Chelsea too high personally, but apart from that can’t see much wrong
I hope Man United can pull together this season. I just want to see you play Prem this season in the end.
I hope your arsenal prediction is wrong, top 4 plz
Good video mate 👍
Are you doing a fpl league this season pal
Hii
Man underrating Spurs again, You're gonna be more than 2 spots off on them this season.
Leicester, Wolves and Palace will struggle alot with little investment. Leeds I think may push for 12th if they carry on signing players
West Ham weren’t in a europa league final, they were in the semis
Hoping United atleast Will get Into the top 4
UP THE CYCLING GK
Some keeper 👏
No idea how you predicted Leicester 7th as we are awful but love the content regardless mate 🤣
Solid prediction. I have the same top 4. Keep up the vids!
Hope you guys have a good day! Would love to win a Premier League ball! 😊
I love you videos Ben hope you are all good you Fricking legend
You’re so wrong on the Bournemouth prediction. We’ve got 14th place written all over us.
Love the content ben!❤❤ hopefully I can win 😉😉
What a great video as always man🔥Yet unfortunate we won't see you in prem this season😭
If you end up retiring (I hope not) you have a great future in making content.
Tottenham are a big one lol
Feel like if chelsea can get timo scoring they can win the league
You freakin’ ledge! Loving the Arsenal shirt! Think you wearing it is some luck to push them top 4. Fulham knocking on the door for Leno? How do you feel wearing the kit? Suits you.
That ball looks sick🔥
Class vid as always
the Stella shirt collab is quality!
Ben, I would absolutely snap your hand off for 14th place after the season us Evertonians had last year. You’re definitely more optimistic than I am for the coming season! Keep up the content and look forward to you announcing your next move in football 👀⚽️
Hope that Arsenal shirt is suggesting something 👀
Quality as always!
gonna bet on this! 😁
Arsenal for 4th!
Big fan, hoping villa exceed your prediction next season!
Man city🦾
I'm a huge fan ben I love to see  your premier League predictions keep the videos up 👍
Would love to see you staying in the prem again! Need a little bit more experience to improve these predictions imo ;P
Think you still have a lot to offer to a PL team Ben even if it's as a 2nd or 3rd choice. Good luck
Get in !!!
About as safe as you can be.
Ball
nice shirt mate ! think arsenal will come 4. this season
Not a chance Chelsea finish about Liverpool. Had a stinker with that Pal. Chelsea don't score enough goals compared to city and liverpool.
how is he allowed to wear an Arsenal shirt ?
11th ben seriously!!No but on a real good predictions
Bold predictions Ben, I'm a Chelsea fan so wouldn't mind us finishing second, we still have a way to go if we want to compete with City
I don't think City will win the UCL. I predict the league and fa Cup.
I’ll take 14th for Everton, great video boys 👍
Forest gonna come calling for ya mate, with Henderson injury keep that phone off silent 😂
Can't make up my mind whether I love or hate that shirt, not that I could wear a kit by a team I don't support like the kids do these days
I really think ur underestimating Man Utd
come on the boyyyys♥️🔥🔥
Big man Ben Fozzyyyyyyyyy
Honestly I think this might be the best prem predictions out there
Those balls are class 👌🏻
Class prediction right here
Loved watching Brentford last season! Hopefully they do well again this year
Brighton last year. Bournemouth and Saints this year. Starting to think you have a thing against the south coast. Maybe a bad childhood holiday experience?
Let Rhino legs predict as well next
would absolutely love to have that ball and keep up the good content benny💯‼
Quality content once again Ben 👍🏼
Cant wait for the 2022/23 season
Love the predictions
The «wrong» at 16:15 🤣
great video Ben, we all hope to see you out on the pitch again this coming season!!
Cmonnnnn
Love your videos ben
Swap United and arsenal and we golden
I truly believe Man Utd have got a fresh start with Ten Heg, and so far they're looking rapid therefore they will finish 1st!!
I say Liverpool is gonna win the league, I doubt city will make it 3 in a row
Keep up the great work
Definition of signing a “Premier League player” with experience...  Signing a player that got relegated Signing a player that is not good enough for another Premier League team Signing a player that is ridiculously overpriced  Think Leeds signings are good depth and covering areas that were weak last season!
Up the gun🔴⚪️
dodgy predictions but we'll see!
Ben foster he is one of our own 🔥🔥⚽️⚽️👍
Mate shame we aren’t gonna see you in the prem this season, still loving the content. I don’t think many people would have seen YouTube as a path after football but you have revolutionised keep it up!
Is Foster a Gooner?
Ben I'm ginger
The big boys💙
As an evertonian if we can bring in a 6 and another forward, we might be able to get top 8-12. But, hoping we can stay far enough away from the bottom this year. Couldn’t take another relegation fight!   Love the Chanel foz!
To up forest position they must start Hennessy
You will be missed Foz...
goat
This is a world footballing first! Someone muttered the words, "another big boy" and "Tottenham" in the same breath. Must have been a mistake.
i think this is close to spot on
How anyone has the top 2 be anything other than City and Liverpool is a bit weird..
Swap Leeds and Southhampton. Other than that some solid predictions
I'd love to win a ball I am collecting all the prem balls since the 2009/10 season  And this is the ball I need next
Arsenal 5th again. Not sure about that but thats bias from be i think we have made quality signing and have a good shout at top 4.
Let's gooooo
The banter of these two is uncanny like. Keep it up fella’s
Enjoyed this offering, as I have all of your uplifting, engaging, and positive energy content! Thank you for sharing this, particularly in the heat! I’m wondering if the Arsenal training shirt being worn by Ben is a clue as to where you will be playing this season?! I certainly hope so - as it would be great to see you challenge and mentor Aaron Ramsdale at the Gunners, and your inspiring high energy would rub off very positively on any club who you choose to sign for! Best wishes, Ivor
U say Newcastle big turnaround to go from 11th to top 6 is hard. look at Westham. 16th to 6th in 1 season
🙌
Chelsea going for the top spot!
Hope ben finds a club soon to see him back on the pitch how about a lovely link up with bale in America?!
Loved the the predictions mate, got lm fingers crossed for the giveaway 🤞
I think Leeds will get relegated and Southampton will just scrape 17th
❤️
are you going to fantasy pl
👏
If i win that ball i promise ill smash it top binz
Im a huge fan Ben. Thank you for bringing us this content and for being an amazing person.
Disagree with Brighton prediction, I think they will finish top ten again, they have a great manager.
Love the content despite your predictions being a little off 😂
Rhino legs is going to regret saying Villa are a couple of seasons behind Wolves ;)
reckon you do a championship prediction aswell Ben
Nice one boys!
Some bold predictions in there fozzy!
Get back at Wrexham Fozzy. Could be the year for them to get out of the National League
Yes fozzy love the content I am such a big fan have a good summer
Love to see your Predictions mate, i hope we still get to see you playing at League 1 level next season !
Come on Ben, if liverpool are in a transitional period having just sold mane then what do u call spurs and chelsea having bought like 4-5 players each??? wont they need time to bed in and understand team tactics? city have lost a few too
Hi ben
I would of waited to see what transfers happen near the end of the window, but to each their own.
Heres my prediction : you wont play in it
Not bad predictions I think you might have a couple wrong but we have to see
Love the predictions. Happy with Chelsea at 2nd.
Awesome Predictions! Fingers Crossed Chelsea do come second, even better 1st 🙌🏻
Up the fozcast
What a prediction!!!! I hope to win the new premier league ball
Excited for the new season! 😁
Spurs to win the League
Ballon Dawson hahaahh
My predictions:  1. Spurs (as a chelsea fan 🤮) 2. City 3. Chelsea 4. Liverpool 5. Arsenal 6. Man United 7. Newcastle 8. West Ham 9. Aston Villa 10. Wolves 11. Brentford 12. Everton 13. Leeds 14. Leicester 15. Palace 16. Bournemouth 17. Southampton 18. Fulham 19. Brighton 20. Nottingham Forest
How's Tottenham a big boy,what makes them big boys😂
5th?! Really?! But I am happier with where you put us than my husband is with where you put his team😂 overall great video again fozzy 👏🏼
Predicting Chelsea above Liverpool? Then Liverpool finishes the league ahead of Chelsea by 20-30 points. Same shit every season lol.
20th Fulham  19th forest 18th everton 4th spurs  3rd chelsea (rent boys) 2nd city  1st liverpool up the tricky reds
Epl is more competetive than ever. We really can't say what is the order between 3 and 9.
Nice prediction, doing better than last season surely
I dont like the choses he made
Love the videos Ben. Few more with the sidemen and chris md please
Ben Foster…. what a legend, best football content on YouTube by far 👍🏻
Maaaate, love to see you at forrest, you'd be great for Deano!
Think arsenal 4th for me fozzy
I haven't lost hope for a US giveaway one day
watch it pal your really angry me
Great vid!
You are a friggin legend fozzy💪
Love the Arsenal top
Bold predictions them fozzy - Would love to win an official league ball, however unfortunately I no longer have instagram haha.. anyway looking forward to the season this year. Haalanc banging in 30+ goals😅😮‍💨🔥
So you wrote Liverpool off last season and was proven wrong but still go for 3rd lmao
I predict… you’ll do better then last year.  Also, come to Arsenal(or a big club), your good enough to start for them.
Nice prediction Ben! Very bullish on Chelsea 😮
Hoping your prediction for villa is wrong and we can push higher then 12th aha 😂😂 UTV
I sorry not a chance Saints are being relegated, top 10 on the table
As a leeds fan I would be buzzin with that league table leeds 16th and building!! Better than last season
What team are you going to be playing for this season Ben?
Ben yes the kit and do you remember me from the cycling show I had the Arsenal kit on
Fozzy
I agreed with a lot of your predictions Ben! Hopefully my Chelsea can at least finish 2nd this seasons, it has been too long since we've challenged for the title
So when you signing for arsenal fozzy lad 👀
🙌🙌
Another great vid. Keep up the good work
One of the most enjoyable channels on YouTube. Solid predictions!
Not sure if you do Q&A, but would love to see an episode what happens to players once they retire. Do teams/uefa (?) pay out a pension once you spent x years in the league?
As a Tottenham fan I'd be satisfied with a champions league spot, would be a dream to be in contention for the league though.
Me like new ball
Hoping for United to finish higher, ut 6th seems reasonable :)
Let’s go! Good vid
Newcastle 7/8th
Editor can you not max out the volume when you show the team badges
With a brand new backline thi k Chelsea will struggle more than  people think, still think they get 3rd or 4th though.
Bit harsh on united I think Ben but can see where your coming from.
Love you Ben foster, my favorite team is Leicester City
Lets goooooo!
Awesome predictions mate! Also those footballs look absolutely insane! ♥️♥️
Are you going to give an update on what your plans are for the upcoming season?
Up the Brighton boys
top ball this season, throwback is sick
Ben love the shirt… please we need you at Arsenal
Chelsea second wtf
No chance Liverpool drop from top 2.
As a Newcastle fan would be more than happy with a top 10 finish. If the 2nd half of last season is anything to go by we should do it quite comfortably. 🤞
Love those balls!
Is he signing for arsenal with that shirt on ?
Man Utd - 20:30  Thank me later
Love the vid lads, up the Chels 💙🤍
👍
Cmon United
Pick me pick me :)
🔥
Ben has just the brightest personality. love u man
COME ON THE BOYS
Great predictions, great content. The balls look absolutely amazing. Keep up the good work.
This year will be really fun to watch premier league Tbh, I hope Wolves will get a higher place this year, made even for EU Conference Leaguea :D
I like the predictions honestly but I think chelsea will fall short of expectations and forest will exceed - the new ball is lovely
He looks a little leaner🤤
Can a dog bite through that ball? Also Tottenham will get 3rd, mark my words
Prediction: you're not in it
This is the best Spurs team (players and manager) in a while and I hope they can win a trophy
Absolutely blowing it away channel wise @emzinho9
Liverpool top of the league for me
ManCity will win the league but will be turned over by United 😬
I’m Huge fan Ben Hope Southampton don’t get relegated but nice to see you again on YouTube!
We wanna know where your going!!!!
Yes 👍 I love arsenal
Love that Arsenal kit Ben! (Love that England strip as well Tom!)
Solid predictions. Can’t wait for the new season😁
⚽️
Those balls really are straight out the 90s, really love the throwback to the mitres!
I’ll take the arsenal prediction as a fan I think it’s reasonable
I reckon Spurs are going to be a real threat this season! United to surprise everyone too. Haaland to win Balon d'Or in a City shirt at some point too!
Forest are spending big though... Would like to know if the prediction would change after this massive window
Try not to cause controversy this time fozzy😂
Yh I would take that losing Connor and not really bringing in a replacement will be a big blow, so we will probably lose a place
Unreal video. Arsenal should be 4th however ;) Them balls look good as well !
Haha 6th???? Thanks for being kind
Got to be Liverpool taking the league to make up for last season! That ball is noice
please let me get the ball
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your so awesome i love the content you have taught me a lot about soccer
Come to arsenal 😉
Chelsea lost rudiger and Christensen 😂 and you think they'll finish above lfc 😂
So you’re telling me Chelsea are gonna get 90+ points this season 😂😂😂 Chelsea will scrape 4th
Great content Ben 👌
Can't wait until Ben is running Match Of The Day :)
I am agreed with 90% of this prediction
Come on the fozzzy!!
I’ve entered the giveaway
Hard to argue but hope you’re wrong! 2 years in a row without champions league a massive deal for Man U.
Ben is signing for arsenal ✔️
them balls look unreal 👌
Massive fan of you Fozzy! Love the videos and the pod :) up the cycling gk
Arsenal on 5th, sort yourself out.

Ben mats how much for u to be my personal goalkeeper coach
Champion: Man City Top 4: Spurs Liverpool Chelsea Top 6: Arsenal Man United Relegation: Southampton Fulham Bournemouth
Great vid , cmon Fozzy
Love the arsenal kit Ben ;)
Goona gk 😔
Hard to believe even one of the "newbies" haven't given you a call. Fine keeper with a wealth of experience, adding positivity around the place and the hotel stays !
I think United are going to surprise you all this season 😉
Where's Watfor- oh waaaaait
think arsenal could get top 4 depending how jesus plays so they have a more clinical goalscorer
When was this recorded ? Strange comment Forest not spending …….
This video is very premature, so much could still happen in the transfer window this summer.
yo
Let's gooo! That Arsenal jersey is clean
switch chelski and spurs and we good
Hey Ben I would love to win the ball ! My top 4 predictions are 4. Arsenal 3.Liverpool 2.Spurs 1. Man City (even though I’m a Chelsea fan !) my bottom 3 is 20. Fulham 19. Everton 18. Leeds and my top goal scorer is either Sterling ,Kane , Salah or haaland but I think Salah but I think son could also get it   Cheers Ben great content keep the good work up !   Up the Fozcast   Good luck in the future
Just came across you channel after a ChrisMD vid. Absolutely love the Chanel, been bingeing your videos. Cheers from the US mate! All the best
COYG
These Balls Looks sick!!
I'm pretty sure united will be top 4 😉😏
I’m a huge fan Ben and a aspiring keeper myself! Thank you for being such an amazing person and goalkeeper! Cant wait to see what you do next! Keep up the great videos ♥️
So Liverpool will finish 3rd because of transitioning. Chelsea lose best centre back in premiership and finish 2nd hmmmm. Don’t even have a striker 😂
u put chelsea second LOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what on earth are u on u liverpool hater
Does the goat of Watford reply??
Love the vid, great predictions, I would love to win one of the premier league balls, I thinks it’s one of the betters ones we’ve had
