That chuckle by Vlad when Boosie says "I'm not a lot of people"😂😂😂
Fuck em, Boosie! Wouldn’t want to be around anyone that wasn’t really fucking with you the long way, anyway.

He is one of the last real ones left. And he's also the voice for the people that don't have one in the music industry.

Boosie been one of my favorite rappers my whole life looked up to him, webbie & Wayne growing people don’t realize the influence the south had/has in the music industry for the past 2 decades damn near the top rapper in the game came straight from Louisiana
That jacket is dope🔥🔥💯
I'm a fan of nobody. I idolize no other man but Boosie has my respect for standing his ground on his beliefs unlike a lot of people. Whether gay or straight, white or black, orange or purple, rich or poor the morality of a person is key
Is this The only thing that  y’all have to talk about is always with about gay people 🏳️‍⚧️trans women🏳️‍⚧️that’s the only thing that y’all can talk about Vlad and Boosie Thank you note is Boosie can never say the word gay only when he’s talking about the Gay 🏳️‍🌈community🏳️‍⚧️ or down to the gay community are talking about trans woman he can never say the word gay  P.S why did I know when he gets back on here and talk to Vlad they were going to ask him gay questions this is the only thing that they can ask people gay.  the gay community is not worried about you like that but on the other hand YALL or warring about 🏳️‍⚧️US🏳️‍🌈 NOW YALL Pay close attention in detail and what he is saying in his conversation I’ll let yall tell me exactly what he saying in the conversation either at the beginning or the end and you let me know exactly what popped out at you
Love Boosie he's real no matter who mess with him he's going to survive for his kid's and his self point blank period

Great job boosie for droppin new gangsta shit album in this era of bitchy rap muzik Boosie should do a Collab more with Southern gangsta rapper like TIP n Jeezy n Vlad was right about 1 thing boosie may not get corporate love but he still n always will got hood love coz real people from da hood knows n recognise what's real....N N N Kanye is big but Durk ain't big I can't accept him as one of da big Dawgs of Rap muzik Durk aight but hez just a regular average rapper ain't no such special n unique thang bout him
The woman talking to boosie probably a old been passed around church hag who though boosie was cute as a kid in the 90s and would have fucjed him snd then years later saw him in person

Donate to diabetes fund $coldblueshamilton
Boosie been the truth💯
10k for interview.. that's tough
They avoid him because most rappers turned gay to be famous
I’m convinced that is a hairpiece
I have the only original image of this photo
Another one ☝️
-110 over/under 50 parts
Rappers avoiding him.......ya gay rappers
damn dis comment section homophobic as fuck lmao
Boosie badazz
Boosie and my 3 year old daughter got the same taste in jackets
Stay tru don’t sweat it everyone has a opinion no one really needs to comment on how f Ed that dude is or how cool cause at end of day no one cares
Whether u bang or not that jacket is tuff!!😤😤😤 Only somebody like Boosie can wear it💯
A real G...
What boosie said bout durk on this interview is what got him dissed by yb today
Part 1 of 75 🤦🏽‍♂️
In case people forgot, Boosie called Lil Nas X a slur on Twitter multiple times and told him to commit suicide. He deleted the Tweet but you can find archives of it on the Wayback Machine and there's some media posts about it. Are you guys seriously going to continue following this piece of shit? You don't just tell somebody to kill themselves, that's fucked up.
No social media for me either. I fuck wit bro the long way. Chi Town!
This guys a certified goofy, and vlad literally interviews this man every other month lol smh 👎🏽
Boosie been rock solid.. It ain’t hard to tell who real or not… Bless Corey C Miller and family.. Stay strong 💪!!!!
Boosie voice: flashback after flashback, Glad TV, I like it… YEAHHHH
Yess I don't have social🤣im blessed
Boosie is all the way real and totally relevant to what the rap game is supposed to represent..real can be proven (facts)..100 can't add up to 1000..Pac said it (it's about p.... and riders)..DMX put it down (where da hood at)..just to name a couple before Boosie, but many more stood up for the real prior  to them..society wanna ride the skirt tail of the civil rights movement for their own hidden agenda..right is right and wrong is wrong..period..there's no in between..two points within everything..understand that and don't be misled and fall victim to underhanded wickedness..because the blind will lead the blind into the everlasting darkness..remain in the light and see urself stand as a real man or woman..anybody can be 100 with ya,but the real ones are gonna forever keep it 1000 with ya..
Boosie interview better than his music. Him and vlad are destined to do these interviews.
You'll always be hated on for  speaking your mind to fake people
Boosie is a OG and should be a gate keeper in hip hop.
Damn this trending 🔥
Man I don't think no other rapper has as much love as boosie does real loyal fans love him 💯
Real deal big bruh 💯 💪
Keep being you Boosie.. 💯
FREELARRYHOOVER

Boosie can NEVER lose my respect
Only thing boosie droppin is the soap in a prison shower
Gone Forever Love Boo.  But Just Go's To Show That Your Favorite Rapper Sucking Dick For An Album🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bruh, no body cares about those comments. The problem is Boosie is literally more known for his interviews with Vlad than nearly all of his music. The guys a glorified one hit wonder.
Romans 10:9-13 ESV Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”
John 3:16 ESV   “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
Bussy stays blowing vlad daddy 🤣. His last album did less than 1k what label is giving this man a budget for an album?
Boosie said some real shit.. No children should not be taking hormones for transition.. Let the kids be kids and once they are adult make that choose.. I am sick of grown ass gay men out here not saying anything..I know some who disagree but wont say anything.Won't talk about how long it took them to go ok I am just a gay man. But yet this str8 man who is speaking up n saying that's wrong y'all mad at..y ppl dont talk about the kids who parents went along n the child change their mind, or went to far and couldn't transition back.. I hope this man keep speaking his mind
Matthew 7:21-23 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’
yeah theyve been avoiding you cos youre a fuckin nut case who trafficked his own kids 😭💀
Romans 6:23 ESV / 2 helpful votes   For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
Boosie jacket kinda hard
YB don’t like this
Glad was so excited on the intro..! 😂😂
I’d sign to boosie he just want shit done right 👏🏽👑
“It’s been a few months” Hell you sure you didn’t mean days?
Boosie venting. He vlad giving my bro his voice. Respect to both. Mad respect. Last days.

Who pays who for these interviews?
Boosie is not that big of an artist to be canceled, he's a hood rapper. The hood 🐀 dudes and chicks are his fans
Didn't even know Durk was dropping today thanks
Boosie have a whole stud lesbian daughter so I don't understand wtf is his problem.  His life is a ball of confusion and hypocrisy
No one is gonna listen to your music boosie
Been waitin for my guy boosie the realist in the industry at this point bro just calls the shit mfs scared to
This date won't repeat until 22/02/2222 lmao.

Hell ya typed in boosie vlad and got a new one
He just keeping it real....not like sum other fakers
I'm not alotta ppl
Boosie made an album in 2 days and decided to drop it the same day as Kanye? Yep this is not going to be good nor is it remotely smart 🤣🤣🤣
❤️
boosies worst cd ever is heartfelt str8 trash

That jacket is 🔥
This man never nisses his therapy sessions with vlad

Dababy said hell nah Ian getting canceled nomo fucking with boosie 🤣🤣
Dont shoot the messenger if nature says it's wrong its wrong if god says it's wrong guess what muthafuckas... its wrong
People act like you’re n allowed to have your OWN opinion theses days. Boosies never went with trends first of all. And second he really don’t care if you like him or not, he’s getting paid and taking care of his business either way 🙌🏻 If more people stuck to their own beliefs instead of trends we’d have a lot more real ones out here
Boosie looking healthier n healthier when he comes back
That's a L boosie lol
boosie BACK ❗️❗️❗️
That coat 🔥
The jacket he is wearing I have but probably not by the same designer. His is I bet cost way more money than mine, but they look the same.
Facts…and he pissed off the higher ups that’s pushing the gay agenda. The agenda is doing nothing but leading them straight to hell…‼️👁
🙏🏽
Boosie is homophobic
We gotta support Boosie before they blackball him out the game.. IG deleted his accounts and now the big circles ain fucking with him.. Didn’t even see Boosie at the AllStar game…
Boosie do numbers on here 😂😂
Man I wanted to watch the whole interview.. don't like that I have to pay for it..but I respect it..
Boosie is loved and appreciated even here in South Africa...Bro the realist for real
They avoiding him cause they gay too…‼️👁
Boosie love talking vlad money for these interviews vlad think they friends
They will never understand boosie.. they to close minded and blind.
Boosie  going triple wood dog

Trouble a real one sometimes it’s fuck the politics sometimes stand by the ones that stand by you
Boosie is the realist Rapper out that's For Real

Boosie said it right, we livin’ in these last days. Yes sir.
Boosie Has Never Been Fully Understood By Mainstream Fans
My brother told me u not sposed to argue wit gay people unless u gay cuz mfs gone think its yo boyfriend lmao maybe thats why niggas aint rockin wit boo 🤣🤣
Idk why I love when he say “uhhh” 😂😂😂
The Hood will always got lov for boosie
What rappers are avoiding boosie doesn't even got songs with Fab or anybody from the d block or new York rappers
Made the album in 2 days 🤣 no wonder I’ve given up on boosie ever releasing a good album
At this point I think Vlad and Boosie are neighbors 🤣🤷🏽‍♀️
Boosie badazz
I respect Boosie
Van summed it up.  People relate to Boosie because they identify with his struggle more than they do his success.  We can't cancel the struggle.
Sound like he in his feelings 🤣 about it
You can’t stop realness 💯 Boosie always good in my book
None of them dropping 😂
I’m not a LOT OF PPL 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Vlade will have boosie there till Christmas😂
They trynna black ball boosie because he fucking with their agenda. It's nothing about gay hate
Yea you def threw this shit together. Idk whats on this album
He gotta be smarter with his mouth mane smh
I love Boosie. The realistic fucking rapper man
Boosie, be yourself Bro . Lots have guys in their families,  yet disagree either their juices.  Theirs 7 billion people on this planet.  You're not going to agree with them all. I don't agree with anyone under 6 feet . I'm just saying . Lol
Badazzz is a real 1
Waaaannnnnnnn
,❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Facts my pops love boosie like he love me and im his son
Boosie looking healthier. I’m glad!
Boogie you our favorite too!!!
Boosie in his best form rn !
I hope he don't get canceled,  sound like he feeling the pressure
He back again. Got damn
Gay people don’t have to change or hide who they are. So why the hell does boosie it works both ways he can say and do what he wants he’s not physically hurting nobody. Just feelings if your feelings get hurt easy big fucking deal you’ll live. You choose to let people hurt you so it’s your own fualt by listening and letting shit bother you easy
WE BIKEEEE ‼️
Am I the only one who don’t give a fuck about albums anymore? I just wanna songs album or not. Everything is digital now so I really can’t tell the difference
Interesting ass jacket
Gay people can walk around saying and doing what they want yes or no. If gays aren’t hurting anyone while they are walking around acting like they want and saying what they want. Then why can’t anyone else walk around saying what they want and acting like they want to if you don’t like a religion don’t listen if you don’t like a conversation don’t listen if you don’t like what others are in too then don’t worry about them. Nothings being hurt but feelings who gives a shit boosie can say what ever he wants if you don’t like the way he believes don’t worry about him worry about your self
The struggle is going to support the struggle. I'm good on that shit.
One thing Ima always respect about boosie is him holding his own. He Don’t get bullied into apologizing, he don’t get bullied into have a certain view on shit because of what everyone else wants. He his own man and feel how he feel on certain shit and stand on that
"IM NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE" 💀💀😂😂
Kodak dropping to
I think everyone has an opinion this world is full of opinions… but if you disrespect a certain (Genre) of individuals don’t get mad when they choose not to mess with you.
Smart man…he know he ain’t going gold or platinum, he’s independent therefore let Kanye sell 175,000 copies his 1st week , Boosie just wanna be mentioned amongst them, dropping the same day as heavy hitters is free publicity, if he sell 50,000 units his first week that’s a huge win….,remember, he’s independent!
King of the $outh frfr
"I'm not a lot of people" 🤣 Uncle Boo ⭐
Boosie jacket hard af 🔥🔥
The reality of it all is he has a right to express his feelings without being looked at as someone hating! I don't care personally what your sexual preference is but it's my right his right to call it how we see it! They have a right to be gay we have a right to not like it for whatever reason it's our right!!!  It's like they have a right to be gay but nobody has the right to speak against it!!! Don't force nothing on me and expect me to be okay with it!!! I'm my own man, and I have much respect for Boosie for standing on what he believes!!!!! Real men do real shit, we don't fold under pressure!!! I have gay family members, but I don't agree with there lifestyle, but I love the as well!!!! We just have a different outlook on life, and I can agree to disagree and keep it moving, you just not gone come in my home and force your way of life on me, you came in this world as man or woman you walk through my door you will be addressed as such.....
Now the gay community wants to control your friendship? Misery loves company. We still love you and the kids Boosie. 💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
👁️
I thought it was a flash back
Funny for no reason 😭
Boosie is 18 year old In a 40 year old body.
Dropping the same day as other household names Boosie crazy
Boosie..........ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhbhh

Nah, fuck that! Let the people who’re spending money show me the most love! 💯 Ain’t that what it’s all about? The money! Stop fucking up your money, Boosie! 💯
I seen it on niggas actions these niggas manufacturing hood shit Boosie is just honestly honest
Boosie and zro are living legends in the gulf coast area. Street pain struggle gangsta music helps people out when they broke and going thru it.
They got boosie shadow banned…album ain’t even on the Tidal home page
Get ready for 2530330 parts of this interview yall
Boosie should be avoided. I watch these to be reminded that there are still black folks who have the goofy audacity to be a bigot. You cannot ‘disagree’ w WHO a person is and fully love/ respect them.
I don’t think neither of those dropped
This nigga said he just went in the computer and threw some shit together. Nah I’m good fam.
Boosie is one of the realest people out
A young Martin Lawrence could've NAILED Boosies impression
So many folks rock with Boosie.
Lil Durk and Kanye didn’t even drop on 2-22-22 lol
💯💯💯
He called durk durt 😂
That must have been the worst preacher then. 😂
BOOSIEEEEE!!!!!!
Boosie is and will always be one of the realist to have ever done it🔥🔥🔥
Boosie a better rapper then Kanye Kanye jus smarter
Yo vlad calm ya ass down with all that yelling
I am not a lot of people
Heartfelt is really Heartfelt!! Go stream boosie a living legend!
Boosie- “I’m not a lot a people” Vlad- 🤣😂 Boosie- 😕
Boosie is dope because he speaks his mind he's not a political robot AND he has a dope jacket.
I fk wit boosie..
We got love for Boosie. 🙏
Preacher lady? Lol she probably a scammer. If today is apart of the end times, WTF was slavery?
Yea he going to be dropping his Album by hisself. No way Kanye actually going to drop his album when he says he is going to.
I hate people avoiding gays or avoiding people who feel a certain way towards gays. Man if you're not gay why in the f*** do you care about however the next person is living their life? As long as they're not trying to push up on you or get you to try it.....f*** it
Ready for the new 20 part interview 😂
Boosie💯✅
Toucan Boujee
He looks like a fruit loop mosaic
I agree , Boosie is the realest since PAC , I can wait til the album, Boosie always making music you gotta run back too, so many hits I can't keep up
Rumor has it that’s the same blunt in every video
The poster child for celebrating ignorance 🤦🏾‍♂️
Boosie’s album is gone flop harder than ever if he drops on the same day as Kanye & Durk💯
Vlads biggest cash cow
Situation starter!!!
Who ready for part 50
Vlad going thru so many voice levels at this clip 😂
People still ain't buying his album anyway..don't forget he got made when he sold like 300 albums
1:05 why vlad laughing like that 😂😂
Rappers avoiding them because they're GAY!!! All these rappers little gay boys
Boosie is the 🐐
Noones buying the album we just like your interviews because your funny
That jacket 🔥🔥🔥
That’s true tho.. Boosie can’t get cancelled.. hes a louisiana legend
Vlad: "Welcome back, it's been a few months."    Lol...
Boosie is a real flaming heterosexual 😂
U got this we still got u n DONT U CHANGE FOR NO FUCKING HOLLYWOOD
Boosie keep your head up long time fan from swerve .distant lover.I got that.all that u was a celebrity to us n the community everywhere but  especially us here in Milwaukee Wisconsin before being known in Hollywood
These homosexuals got you so called gangster rappers shook. This is why I stand with boosie ✊🏿
Boosie and Vlad might as well be friends because Boosie did a tons of lot of interviews with VladTV.
This Vlad shyt getting played out Boosie ain't had a hit in centuries
Donda 2 🤣 who tf bought Donda 1 let alone listen to it Kanye west is trash
I'm not a lotta ppl 1:03 ..... Str8 Face
Boosie dropping, I'm checking out the album. Lil Durk dropping, I may check out the album. Kanye dropping, I'll pass on that.
This nigga ain't had a classic album since BAD AZZ‼️ His shit is double wood‼️
Bruh Boosie you said that ish for your kids kids...that ish was a historical moment for youtube and for the streets...
I'm 39 an have been listening to this man since I was 15. His album will be the 1st i listen to then Durk (an I'm actually from Chicago) but Bossie gets the love 1st. Then Kanye
Women have a vegina and men have a penis for two reasons. One being procreation, second I'll let you guess
My birthday great day to drop an album 22222 Pisces girl 4 life baby🦋💕🖤💋
I love Boosie dnt get me wrong but I can't b da only one dat think he b on Vlad too much like damn it's not even exclusive like da first couple times no more like I wanna miss him a lil bit damn
Boosie the 🐐
Boosie is real. And so he has people's hearts.   Boosie Boo
Nice coat bossie
Sorry boosie but nobody’s buying that shit.

They did the same to Mohammad Ali and he’s known today as the greatest
Gone Always Rock With Boosie 💋
Boosie be smoking some fat ass spliffs, don't worry boosie, we still ain't rocking wit that lil x girl... No way I'm associating my nigga Nas name wit that chump

Why would boosie think it's a good idea to drop around that time anyways 🤔
Boosie crazyyyy stuff🔥🔥🔥
Boosie been real god bless u brother
Ain’t nobody checking for Durk, he still ain’t turn up for his crash dummy Von and his bro D thang, both of em.
Yea exactly, tone that laughter back down Vlad…you saw Bossie face. Not one smirk…SAME DAY!!
Lol Vlad got it titled like boosie said some zesty shit. Keep that eye open.
I’m really convinced DJ VLAD is really gay
Yo! Only song I heard with Boosie was the one with CML.  Someone put me on his best songs
He's a down to earth person
Thank you
Gonna see these boosie clips til summer
part 1 out of 63….let’s go!!!!
The industry is so fake - pathetic
Can Boosie spell love🥴 A preacher sat there and said all that to an ungodly person. It's the blaq male worship for me.
I cant wait for 2023 when the rest of this interview drop !!!
Aww Boosie still flapping them gums?
Uncle Boosie is back
Boosie need to name drop the rappers who been avoiding him so we can avoid them these rappers are real life punks
All the punks on here mad😂
i support boosie more for making a stand
Zzz🤔
It's not a good marketing strategy to drop your album the same day as two other rappers who could overshadow you. That's why rappers pick their own day to drop so that people can pay more attention to it
To the person that is reading this, Don’t give up on your YouTube channel. Keep going it’s going to get better ❤️‍🩹
BOOSIE be carrying vlad at this point..
Yeaaaaa pick another date bruh
Boosie keep bringing the 🔥  Boss Hog
Love Bossie no matter what.
Hood love
“I got Love from people that don’t Have social media”…. 🙌🏿🙌🏻🙌🏾🙌🏿 MOST GENUINE COMMENT EVER…
Those same rappers that avoid him for his gay comments are rappers that feel the same exact way about that subject but are too scared to voice their opinions because they’re cowards on the hate they’ll get
That jacket🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m amazed that Vlad has been able to milk this much content outta this guy.
Nah they avoiding you because your interviews abd opinions are more entertaining than that played out music.
Hold on 😩😩 he tried to drop an album the same time as Kanye?… 😩😂 Boosie playa have you ever thought on taking a class on marketing?????
✨💯✨💯✨💯✨💯✨ keep dropping albums big guy... iiim gone keep playing  'em on 3rd shift... ✨💯✨💯✨💯✨💯✨ III
Recklezz fresh home. Lol need dat nigga back on here
I'm on whip me down x6.
Kanye & Durk didn't even drop😂
I wish my brotha @JayeHammer was on the album.
I'm not a fan of rap and rappers (old skool) but I like this guy💯 There's a gay agenda for sure and the world is going to suffer as a result of it.  I may not live to see it, but destruction is coming.
New album is cool and all but the more important thing is what does he think about Joe Rogan and Eminem? And does Boosie know that vlad has never been recorded saying the n word?
Vlad gets so hype when he has boosie on because he can smell the money coming in 🤣🤣
Definition of legendary 💯!
💯💯💯💯💯💯
Damn boosie always racking up interview numbers 🔥
This the boosie & Vlad show 🤎 2-22-22 ♏️

BOOSIE PRAY WITH ME " GOD PLEASE SAVE US FROM THESE DEVILS, EVERYING THEY SAYIN AND DOIN WILL BE USED AGAINST THEM IN THE COURT OF HEVAN. I PRAY WITH YOU NOW AND HOPE THAT WE CAN BE SPARED FROM THE UNJUST TREATMENT OF THE SYSTEM." GOD KNOWS WHATS RIGHT AND HE TOLD ME 80% OF STATE TROOPERS WILL BURN I HOPE THE POLICE SEE THIS  someone help us please this isn't fair

Not gonna front boosie the Kong of chitlin circuit but bro for him to drop as same day is kanye is peer insanity to me. Wth are you trying accomplish boosie.   Bro let's be real ima real boosie fan like fr. Nobody has bought any of these albums he's dropping on everything  boosie only rapper I kmow that you can't find half of his new albums. Not spotify not tidal not youtube music.  Only albums are his classic and the Album he made before he went in and after he got out. That's it. Bro we love your Bafoolery but where is that album material not no average shit.  Boosie you putting out average music ima be real I don't hear boosie in no car no more.  Like distant lover is f#$%^&* classic bro.  That's that boosie we love.  And if see this he's gonna get mad and say I'm hating f%$k you . But I get it bro your artist and sensitive about your sh#$. We both have that lil man complex I get it bro

Y’all people need to learn the difference between not agreeing with something and completely disrespecting someone. My father don’t agree with me being gay but he never disrespected me EVER! I tell people this all the time! It’s the disrespect that triggers me I can’t speak for everyone else
Boosie badazz🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn Vlad sang that welcome to Boosie 🤣
Will always love him. Stand for what you believe in period. They believe what they believe and you have the right to believe what you believe that doesn't make you a bad person and it doesn't make them bad people. We don't always agree with everyone's life style choices and that's OK as long as we can show respect.
Lmao 😂😂, 💩 gone flop like BooPac the nerve of this dude, no comparison 👎🗑️
Man I'm glad I'm looking crazy already but damn I'm surprised most famous people ain't with all the public b.s they go through shit I like Boosie badazz music few others g as now news iv never liked just saying why call people gay shit just because they ain't out man hoeing just saying shit  his music always truth so why down him I mean just because he's not having woman or whatever u think he's gay for don't mean he's gay shit he might just not want one around right now see so glad I'm in crazy mood LOL because I hate judgmental fn pricks exspecialy not knowing him or anything see news mess people up this gay comment o didn't need hear Boosie badazz sorry u artist go through life shit but blast everyone to see isn't kewl keep making music though frfr always had faith in you I have memories lost issues but I know few people I had faith would make it Big u One of them

"gotta move from my releases my bro"
Boosie the realest rapper in the game. He stand on principles that other rappers are scared too. They will gladly rap about killing but are terrified to make a comment about homosexuality
DaBaby stopped talking to Boosie

Bossie looking like the new fresh prince 👑

Why does he keep interviewing him though. At this point, it's kind of low hanging fruit. And the album won't make numbers like he thinks it will.
A lot of rappers not trying to fuck up their image that’s the reason why rappers avoiding him !
He's A Real Nigga & I Respect Him
EyyyyyBody Love Boosie! 💯💯💯
Hey guys, it's about to be a long ride so buckle up.

Boosie welcome back for the 1,272 nd interview
They stay trying to force this gay agenda on everyone and Boosie ain’t with that. That’s what’s up 💯💪🏽
Welcome back again 😄
These rappers are like Slaves they can't even Work with who they feel like working With🤨🤨
Boosie got love from people who dont got social media ... "me".. all the other sheeple just following trends.. making the corporate institution billionaires richer. While they cry cuz they poor. Get off your ass and actually do something which yo self. Stop getting the establishments richer, get yo self richer. Much love boose. And remember God made Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve. The Devil is the greatest deceiver.
I love boosie but he about to go double wood
The media is really forcing the LGBTQ+ influence. Made it to Episode 4 of Bel-Air to find out the person Ashley has a crush on is a girl and she portrays as a 12 year old. Bro WTF!!!
Part 1 of 267
Last of a dying breed
I f*ck with you boosie but you dumb asf for dropping on the same day they gone get all the attention and people will over look you 😂😂😂😂😂😂

Dj Vlad is a piece of shit making money off the pain of young black artists. You suck dude.
The 🐐 of VLADTV is back!
Boosie supported more than he can see. I hope all these fake folks actually stand up. Noone hates anyone for their decision to live thei lives they way they don't, he, like many folks, just don't agree with the manner in which it is done and the manner in which it is being forced upon everyone.
I was just saying Boosie laying low on the internet

The record labels tell their artist to not mess with Boosie Because they're also gay🏳️‍🌈. They got their feelings hurt. No 1 can do 💩ish to Boosie 😎Because he's I.N.D.E.P.E.N.D.E.N.T. do you know what I mean Mayne! BOSS 💩ish😎!!! $$$
J cole didn’t collab with Boosie?
I miss the days where grown men dressed in blazers and wore some cool slacks with some converse sneakers. These dudes be looking like they never got out of a Jr.Highschool mentality . Smh.
I. Love. Boosie. He's. My. Fav❤❤❤❤
Boosie is a racist pos. Anyone who supports him is also a racist loving loser.

Vlad couldn’t wait to get boosie back on here 🤣
Creek squad
Only reason why rappers swerved boosie for the gay comments is because they gay themselves.
Vlad a bihh
Boosie know his shit gone flop anyway, so why not drop his album on the same day
Everyone bump boosie from the south
✊🏿
Funny thing is u can say anything about bk ppl white ppl. Handicap ppl. But the min u comment about them. U get banned. Since when we get so soft we let them gain so much power? Smghh. I fooks with ya bossie
Sounds like Yo gotti and Gucci.... Gucci like why you dropping  on 1017 ?.... Gotti like I didnt even know BUT BADASS said its an marketing strategy....... Respect for the honest answer Badass!!!
I love u for my birthday 🎉 gift 🎁 💗u Boosie 💗💗💗💗💗💗

First person to promote their music on Glad... smh
That jacket too fresh 🙏🏾💯
Yesssirrr. Here we go again
I bet it will be spring time before this interview is over
Boosie been solid since day 1 gotta respect him he done beat cancer the streets death row give him his flowers while he’s here don’t say ya miss him when he gone
Most of these industry circles are full of  phony people. That's why 50 Cent doesn't rock with em like that. Boosie ain't a part of the "clique" so he's gonna be straight either way since he's INDEPENDENT. It takes a lot for a man to stand his ground since a lot of cats can be brought.
Everytime I see my kids this nigga got a new Vlad interview
That jacket tough asf 💪🏾
This interview be over in July 🔥
Just another weak af album thats going to go wood. I just went into the computer and found some weak af music to throw out there for you suckers. Thats wtf Boosie meant to say. Bahahahahahaha.
Dude you don’t need to interview nobody else just interview Boosie every time! If not boosie ppl who hole come on and keep it real!! Most of your guest just be on here to flex and stunt and tell lies to make themselves look better
Boosie too real for the industry, no other way around it💯🤷‍♂️
Big 30 dropped his album round drake and Kanye last album and that bitch went harder then both they albums to me key word is me!’!!
Yep
I have the strangest feeling that boosie is gonna be talking some major shit this interview 🤔
Yep.... Boosie from my city, State in addition he is my birthday twin..... Love him! 😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍
Ask Boosie about the movie that was supposed to drop on Christmas
Boosie give the best interview 💪🏾
Lmao the title is too funny they gonna spin this one what you mean his comments were gay ?😂😂😂
Lol vlad genuinely love this niqqa boosie
Much love from Pittsburgh Boosie
Lil boosie has a lot of love in Texas.That's classic here that trill ent shit. Even Raza like me fuck with it lol
Boosie locked back in Vlad’s basement for another 2 months!
Vlad like a girlfriend when introducing Boosie
Boosie again
Vlad got Boosie on 365 days of the year 😂😂😂
Boosie does a vlad interview every five minutes. Vlad must live in boosies game roomer something 😂
That coat is tough 🔥🔥🔥
This man NEEDS Vlad and Lil Nas X stay relevant lmao.
Boosie will sell 15 albums
Nussie did the same shit
That jacket pressure
Listen Boosie, you may not be aware, but pastors are professional a** kissers

Doesn’t feel like a few months. Feels like the last clip was a week ago 😂
I AGREE WIT CHA BOOSIE

Fed TV 🐽
I’m curious how Boosie and Upchurch colab came to be
He’s back
Boosie fit clean asl
Boozie need to get promoted from associate at Vlad studios.

Boosie back
Salute and Respect Boosie All The Time.......❗✌🏿💯💪🏿✊🏿❤
Hell I support him more after the comments , go boosie
If That Jaccet Was All Gold Bandana On RR20llnn 20$ Crip I Would Get 20$ Of Them N Let's Start Banging Boosie Like it's 07 or 08 All The Youngins Go Listen from Boosie Ghetto Stories Album 2 Gangsta Musik 2 RReturn Of The BadAzz 2 That Green N Yellow CD 2 Now 💯💯 LET'S SUPPORT THE RREAL AGAIN FRFR ✌💯💯
Most of those rappers punks. That's why
Vlad:alotta ppl try not to drop on the same day Boosie: "I'm not alotta ppl 🤣🤣 Boo set Vlad straight real quick💯
Boosie is the first of the black culture to start being canceled!! Don’t think they aren’t coming for everyone, each time we allow this censorship the little more power they take from us
THE RAMS use his song as a intro in the Super Bowl. The crowd was jumping
Vlad the only guy that interviews this guy
I'm not a lot of people 😐😐😐😐😐
Boosie stood up to the gay bully community!! You all were hiding in Eminems closet back in the day. Now you all piggy back riding that gay rapper.
When Boosie said "I'm not a lot of people" I felt that 💪🏾
Did a track with UPCHURCH
Does Vlad ever use the drums in the background?
I hope all the love boosie gets in the comments translate to sells
Mane that jacket is 🔥 tho
This interview will be chopped up and played till covid is over
How much lean do you give him to get him there
Look bro I am not a fan of Boosie music but I got alot of respect for man who stands his ground on his beliefs despite the lashback from the entertainment industry
@Boosiebadazz at this point vlad need you;  to stay relevant smh I only watch to see you talk Fuck vlaD 🖕🏿 appropriating  culture 🦅azz💯💪🏿
We living in the last days baby 💯
Durk finna do more number than boo

BoosieTv

Part 1 of 239
Bossie the goat💪🏽
Don't cut his dic off mayne😂😂
Finally … a boosie interview ive been waiting
Hood love loves bad behavior? That is stupid and illogical.
Boosie back 🙌🏽
Boosie just took a shower, changed clothes, ate and sat back down for another interview...
What kind of jacket is that 🤔🤔
Smoking on that o block down here in the south
Boosie a legend whether u like it or not
Trend or Trend 🤔
Vlad sounded to excited at the beginning 😆 🤣 😂
That jacket is tufffff🔥
Nobody buys Boosie music 😂
Never miss boosie interviews!!
Thought vlad dropped another FLASHBACK 😭😭😭💯
Vlad sounded extra SUS when he introduced boosie this time lol
One thing for sure Boosie always know Baltimore fucking with you 1500 shit the real 1500
Ppl forget how long boosie been doing it at that level. Keep in mind...I'm damn near 40 and I remember him being big when I was 15 or 16...like really big for an essentially independent artist.
lets predict how many parts vlad is gonna chop this up into, ill go first : 60 parts
“I’m Not A Lot Of People” 😂😂😂😂 FACTSSSS !
I'm interested in how that's a good marketing idea. Learn something new everyday.
“I’m not a lot of ppl” Boosie
I love him
I’m not a lotta people!   I felt that!..
Damn I knew something was missing in my life
Bout time
Part 1-59
How many times will Vlad remind us he’s never used the n word over Under 3
We always love you boosie man took it on the chin stood tall respect my brotha boosie for president!!!
this is either a symbiotic or parasitic relationship and I can't tell
Dope luv from brooknam
That. Didn't. Happen.
I feel bad 4 him.  Hes a victim of his own ignorance.
15k 46 minutes damn 🔥
Coat 🔥
The people still mess with you boosie
"from real people" fax
He back let's get about forty-five clips lol.
Vlad gotta pay for heat in the studio. Boogie got winter coats…DL was totally geared up & the list goes on. Stop being cheap Vlad
Boosie should get equity in VladTV
Just cuz of that ima buy booseys album, stand up for your beliefs my guy, The gay community have their beliefs and we have ours that stuff is weird i dont care who they love or what they love but dont push that agenda to kids theyre babies let them figure what they really want in life. Same goes for anything you raise em right feed vegetables and exercise daily if they grow up to be fat,and lazy thats cuz they chose it. Simple.
I had to come back, because that I got love from real people hit me hard. The love boosie get from people are from the struggle. Not these social media people these days. The grannies,  the hood people who stay silent and solid, not the people looking for like on the media.
76 parts any bets?
He got the 2005 flea market  coat on. 🗝🏢🏘🏣🏘🏢🏘
Rappers will distance themselves from someone who says a gay slur but will welcome and smoke a fat blunt with a murderer.   XDDDDDD
boosie got a bad marketing team
Boosie is such a dinosaur. I guess he enjoys getting silenced by the Illuminati for insulting the LGBTQ community every five minutes. It's sad that he is still dying on this stupid hill. 😂😂😂
Top 10 maybe
them labels probably did tell they artists to stay away from boosie  the rainbow community got a lot of power they will stop ya money some way or try and get you cancelled🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Aight fellas buckle up. This is only the start. Part 1/400. I’ll see y’all in 3yrs when the last part of this interview drops 😤💯💯
How many clips to expect now?
I’ll see y’all on Memorial Day
Somehow someway We have to make black men strong again !!!! In a real way ! Most of them act like mamas … no daddy around !!!!!
By the time this interview finishes, some of us will be at a completely different stage of our lives.
Boosie and vlad are homies
Stop doing interviews with this culture vulture,  demon,  he doesn't respect black people and we should not support him.  If you support Vlad you aren't black !!!
Sending everyone good vibes
We forever rocking with boosie fuxk that other shit !💪🏽
Vlad : what up boosie before we get started what's up with that jacket..😁
Man it’s finna be 40 parts to this interview 😂
REALLY DAM......YA JUST CAN'T STAY AWAY....... MARRIED HAPPIER EVER AFTER🧟🧟🧟
Great another Boosie interview. I've been so curious to know his thoughts on Ukraine / Russian border situation.......................
There really is a difference between "Hood Love" and "Corporate Love" and Boosie is like the last of a dying breed 💯
‘Welcome back’ ….. did he ever leave tho?
Prepare to be hypmotized by them clips
Yes life just keeps getting better 🔥🔥
That coat really funny 🤨🤨 but whatever iyk-yk 🤷🏾‍♂️
That hood love not bringing them dollars in tho 😂💯
Boosie is a beta male can not control his emotions!!! Grow up son …
HOW MUCH IS BOSSIE GONE SELL 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Vlad holding him a hostage atp
Boosie got loyal fans world wide like Michael Jackson.
I’m not a lot of ppl 😑
You gotta love boosie!
Copy cats
Boosie a Legend
and, no one knew about his new album.....way to go for your marketing strategy and no one knew about ur new release LOL
This finna be another classic Boosie interview 🔥
Some of y’all Boosie fans are 🤡‘s. You act like you support him but you didn’t buy his album a couple years ago when he sold 300 copies. That was before he was being openly homophobic. Now y’all act like so called cancel culture is affecting him lol. The same 300 people who supported him before still support him now. Even when he just said he made a album in 2 days and threw the shit together to sell. Sounds like real quality work and I’m sure cancel culture will be the only reason it doesn’t go platinum.🤪🥴
When you make the right moves with your money you don’t have to be politically correct!!!👍🏿👍🏿
I've been waiting on another interview of boosie💪he never fails to entertain
Can’t say the other Rappers are GAY & expect them to be your homies
DAT RAQ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️💯
We waitun on another 1 Skooby!!!
80 EPISODES
Proud to say boosie also has love from the Mexican..can stop won't stop boosie
Big Skoob
This interview will probably last till 2/22/23 🙄
BOOSIE IS OUR 2PAC
Boosie Bad one of the greatest of all time this guy a legend for real
With the title saying "rappers avoiding him after gay comments" he is giving us a hint that half or even all of the rap industry is gay even your favorite rapper lol I'm glad Im a 90s baby I don't listen to non of this watered down industry.
When I was a young man going through trials and tribulations and transitions....I used to hop in the whip and put on Smokin on Purple and roll some purple. It got me through some rough time...Boosie let young men know they not alone out here even if they got whatever issue they have. I will always be a supporter. Side Note: Wipe Me Down is a Certified Hood Classic.
Boosie and Vlad are like Kobe and Shaq in the 2001 playoffs lmao unstoppable with the content
Is he rewearing this jacket?
@1:52 boosie face got me dead “ya really”
Boosie is the truth 💯 would be nice he start his own podcast

BOOSIE THE MAN
🌻I'm a 1st Huem/\n don't play with me
The streets love BOOSIE whether you believe it or not he can not get cancel

Boy a clout chaser... you chose yb.. stay on that side lame
Boosie that nigga ..
For some reason, when he said he did it in two days that made me NOT wanna listen. 🤔
Boosie so fkn lame.. I knew from day 1 he was fake . Something deep inside me knew it .. it's like a radar for fakes .. he never did anything he rapped about.. his BM exposed him

Man boosie a real one ☝️
I just can't believe how 9@¥ society has become now! It's Ridiculous! Boosie is one of the only straight rappers left!
Young boy drops that day too, I think..
THAT JACKET SO HARD 🎯
That old Boosie going crazy
I rock with Boosie! Which is unlikely for a person like myself! But he’s very authentic & I agree with his positions!
B O O S I E B A D D A Z Z

He had nothing to say about his actual album... 😂😂😂  Vlad: So tell me about the album? Bossie: uhhmm.. uuhhhuh.. uh.   😂😂😂
Trouble one of my favorite artist no cap

Boosie need to produce his own reality show about him and his kids. Just do it on you tube. Use a real production company (if he can afford it).
Boosie new shit going quadruple trash can lid

That jacket... O yea!
People forget that there's a large amount of people that don't actively use or express themselves through social media. A lot of those types rock with guys like Boosie. Makes it hard to measure that kinda love.
