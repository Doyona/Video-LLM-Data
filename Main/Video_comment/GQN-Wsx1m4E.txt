Patrick bamford duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh
I am a Leicester City fan. I'm not too happy with the result, but we had some big chances, and if it wasn't for the offside rule, we'd take home a massive 3 points. All the team can do now is look forward and train hard for Everton on the 1st of May.
That was the most painfull goal to be rulled offside
Hope Leeds go down and Leicester stay up
brilliant clearance at the end, well done, whats this lads name?  Bamford? gonna watch out for this up and coming defender
Bamfords miss against Brentford away this season was actually worse than this.
If ever I'm to be executed by firing squad I want Bamford to fire the shot. No one else.
It's time for Bamford to move on and give someone else a try.
Credit Kelechi for that pass even with a tight groin. By the way, can we check if Bamfords eating ok? After seeing that not sure he can even finish his dinner
I've never known a striker such as Bamford who needs so many chances to score. He's not a top level player.
How did that guy ever get into the England team. He's utterly useless.
Plymouth away it is
Two poor teams.   Rematch next year in the 2nd division
You win draw lose as a team .
I arent saying this because of that sitter he missed but why is he even still at the club? Poor in front of goal and injury prone!
How is Bamford a professional player. Can you really not find anyone better Leeds?
You can't just blame 1 player
How did banford miss that from there ..beyond belief..few good saves by lesta keeper too...both teams struggling fair result I reckon
Dont know whats funnier..Bamfords miss or the way he went down holding his face a few seasons ago against the Villa.
iversen class
Hahaha Bamford screaming at the player for not giving him a tap in.. literally the corner from that cross he has a tap in and spoons it. 😂
Wow! Bamford 3 goals in 24 appearances says it all 👋👋
I don`t think I`ve ever seen a player work harder OFF the ball than Vardy.
He is not a premiere league player
Bye Leeds
If that Tielemans hit that thunderbolt any harder there would be no goal left
Almost criminal to disallow that Telemann goal
Tielamans robbed
Good to see vards scoring again, shame we couldn’t score more. Everton next, hopefully we show how good we actually can be🦊
bamford is the worst striker in premier league history.
Don’t read my description ^
Leicester's first was not offside. VAR interfering with the results again.
If Leeds stay up this season I will eat all of my shoes. I don't own a hat.
Patrick bamfraud, how has he made a career out of football I'll never know!
He did the same 3 days earlier versus Fulham. It was going wide versus Fulham off his right boot, and needed a deflection off a defender before it went in. Remember?
If kane leaves spurs im sure they put a bid in for bamford 😂😂😂😂😂
Cleary should write "Leeds Defence costing Leeds"..Bit harsh on Bamford on his bad foot... Go easy there ye and I'm not even a Leeds fan
Shame about Tielemens' goal, was an absolute screamer
Bamford is utter toss
It's over, we're  relegated
Bamford is hacking a career man like how is he pro
Barnes Maddison Tielemans Vardy Iheanacho, too many quality players, they can’t go down 😢
Leicester need better keepers man ffs
Bamford isn't doing a lot to prove Sean Dyche wrong is he, he plays like someone who was born with a silver spoon, even the way he runs looks like he's never done a days work in his life
Vardy will obviously be a legend because of his major part in Leicester winning the league. But he's been washed for like 5 years, can't pretend he's a really good player anymore
Bamford always been a hit and miss type player. Never really rated him
Bamford definitely should have scored, but I've seen worse sitters missed. His was a little more awkward because it came behind him. He tried to adjust his feet but wasn't quick enough.
Imagine kicking the post in anger then missing the same post wide with a sitter... ouch!!
2 poor sides, both deserve the drop
Sadly that miss from posh boy will probably be the end of us.The facts are that we have been very poor all season.MOT.
Patrick bamford is only a premier league player in Leeds fans eyes
OAP Vardy scoring is pretty embarrasing these days for any opposition team.
I don't know what was worse, the lack of subs when we're being pumped for 35 mins or the Bamford miss.
I’d love to see Leicester and Everton relegated. Would be really interesting to see their players leave and then them having to rebuild in the championship
Bamford...music to my ears
Surely Bamford was offside anyway?
Nothing makes me happier than Bamford being sad
Bro I was celebrating when Bamford shot. I couldn't imagine anyone missing from there
Offsides like for the disallowed goal shouldn't be an issue. If he's coming back onside to get the ball what's the issue? Surely the attacker is at a disadvantage
We need to sell bamford
James Maddison is actually outstanding. Deserves a big move in the summer
Bamford is a red , good lad
Brrrro Pahtrick Behmford is so bad even my grandbaba is soooooooo much behter
It's 5ime to bin Gracia off NOW. The t4am needs freshening up. Gnonto ,Somerville Greenwood are all itching to be involved from the start. Why not give them a go we can't do any worse
Bro the cross from Harrison was top tier
Has to be sold. Awful awful player.
iheanacho 😍😍😍😍
First it’s good to see vardy in play , why the coach don’t use him I will never understand , vardy is a goal getter , second and most important , why isn’t anyone talking kelechi assist , he made a brillaiant assist even while in pain
Great game, I think Leicester were probably the better team on the whole but a point doesn't really help either side a great deal but not giving away three to a relegation rival certainly does....
Why are left footed players so one footed? Something genetic??
Leeds or Everton going down
Summer Sales any minute now - let’s cut our losses -Burnley did it -come back stronger with a proper vision - blend of youth - Perkins - Greenwood- Creswell- Cody- gray - Joseph not sure about Joffy - keep cooper Ayling n sell everyone else shame about Gronto - adams n wobber wasn’t meant to be
That's really embarrassing from Bamford since he screamed just before that after not getting the cross he wanted
As an Everton supporter thank goodness for Patrick Bamford.
Bamford with the "if in doubt, get it out" clearence at the end 💪
There's a reason Bamford has spent most of his career in the championship.Good team player but misses way too many chances.
Leeds fans no saying “ way” when caddy scored 😂 silent little s*um 😂 hope Leeds go down like 👌
Good lord I hope Leeds go down 🙏
Leeds have the smell of death about them
Bamford Bamford Bamford 😶😶😶😶
Patrick Bamford Leicester's  best defender. Lol.
Can’t just blame Bamford whole shape of team is wrong stuck with marsch to long
Bamford miss 😂😂😂
Bamford fuming his teammate didn’t play it across goal the highlight before his sitter💀
Leeds Leeds falling apart again. Marching down together. Deluded Leeds United 😂😂😂😂😂
I’m better than Bamford, he is soooooo bad just like the keeper. We are down, how many of those players do you fear losing?! NONE!! Gnonto that’s it. Disgraceful
Glory glory Leeds United...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lads queue the joy division it's happening 😂😂
Relying on a plank like Bamford for goals - that’s why we’re going down.
Hahahaha Bamford what a melt
Sky sports “best disallowed goals” video at the end of the season
What a shame the first goals ruled out what a hit
Patrick Bamford doing what Patrick Bamford does best. Nothing 😂 how is this man in the top flight?
As a Liverpool I hope both Leeds and Leicester stay up 👆
Bamford is defo the worst striker in the prem in my opinion! Better off when hes injured 😂
If Leeds get relegated they sure as hell will remember this game as the game that cost them.
30 mil Ritter and dosest get chance to play
Nice to see Vardy back, where he was
Time to go Bamford
Though disallowed,Tielamans only ever scores stunners!
Vardys celebrations will be a miss when he retires, he loves winding up fans 😂
So glad it was bamford who missed that and i really hope it sends leeds down 😂
Relegation here you come Leeds ha ha Yorkshire's biggest joke even bigger than Wednesday
Bamford is so crap, he's living off one good season with no fans in the stadium, he can't handle pressure. I'm sure he's a great person but only a championship striker at best. Leeds have neglected pretty much every area and bought substandard players all over. ORTA OUT
Bamfail
Bamford needs to go
Bamford's finishing rating is lower than my mums.
Leeds are going down
The commentators always oh, bamford was an ex-Chelsea academy player and went to private school, we feel sorry for him
How is Bamford still striking for Leeds United 😂
A fair result in the end as both teams had their chances to win.
Bamford should retire after that
Bamford's gotta go
Leeds need to get away from Patrick Bamford leading the line. He's rubbish.
Bamford was offside anyway
I was having palpitations with those corners at the end! And kels with the pass even with a groin problem
Leeds have the worst manager to ever step into the premier league
Leeds will be relegated because Bamford gets too many starts, he’s not a Premiership striker…..
I keep thinking Leicester have david luiz
Bamford couldn’t hit water if he fell out of a boat!
Why didn't daka just shoot?
Bamford championship quality at best
How has tielemans offside there ? Or was it the bloke who passes it to him
Bamford doing Bamford things
Castallenos
No way was that a sitter. Doesn't matter how close you are to the goal, it's coming at pace and is behind him. He should have done better but to say he 'definitely should have scored' is like saying Daka should have done the same with his chance. Great game, nonetheless and a point was probably what each of them deserved
Leeds looks to be going down..
Bamford was offside anyway
What a finish from Tielemans, someone should do a segment on goals that could have been.
What did maddison say when he missed from 6 yards?
Kicking or rather tapping the post with your foot because no one passed to you and then you miss and open goal when your practically on the goal line. The guy genuinely belongs in lower league football, its actually embarrassing someone with his lack of skill and talent can start in the premier league. Baffling.
Shame on you Leicester u don’t deserve to stay in premier league
Vardy winding up the Leeds fans 😂😂😂 Cranks
Imagine banging in a screamer like that and having it chalked off 😂😂
so gutted as a Leeds fan man
To quote Kevin Keegan…”I would love it if Leeds get relegated “
The money Leeds got from Phillips was invested well in Rutter. Makes perfect sense to replace a pivotal part of your squad with a player I genuinely forgot was on Leeds books.  All Leeds aren’t we 😂
Leeds might have missed a sitter at the end but Leicester should have won that game
Leicester could have won by 3. Leeds should be happy with that draw. Yes bamford was offside at the end there 👍
Had it with Bamford.. cannot understand how he is our number 1 striker. A striker that can score goals will score so many more than Bamford in that team. Think of the chances which he misses, with him it’s not about the ones he scores. Remember a few seasons ago when he was the shadow of Kemar Roofe, never liked Bamford, never will, can’t stand him. Give him away as a goodwill gesture if it was up to me
Bamford actually had a great game, his hold up and link play was fantastic all night, real shame about the miss. Crazy the level these guys operate at, one mistake and it defines your game
Kelechi was the hero in this game, playing a vital pass for the goal whilst limping 🦊🦊
Our most dangerous player once again sat on the bench, at this point it's clear Javi has an issue with him. Gracia and Bamford are taking us to the Championship
Love vardy giving it to Leeds fans after his goal
Vardy. Got to hand it to him.
I genuinely don't get it. Rodrigo was on a goal scoring streak, then Patrick bamford as soon as he's back from injury, Rodrigo get benched. Ever since, despite the mediocre performances from bamford, Rodrigo still gets out on the bench. This isn't just with javi garci but also with Jesse marsch. What's up with it??
Why Don't Leeds play their top scorer rodrigo up front and their most creative player gnonto. Baffling
Safety first from Bamford, but he should have had a call from the keeper
Iheanacho still managing to put that pass through after pulling his groin goddamn hero
Well done Leicester  for keeping leeds down there
Leeds defence is shocking
investigate bamford lmao that's borderline Match fixing😭
Bumford
Sini and Harrison going to tear the championship apart next season
Ineacho is the difference in this team. When he plays well they all play well. But more importantly that pass even though he’d clearly pulled his groin was perfectly placed
Bro bamford is a just a poor man’s Nunez. He misses sitters all the time and throws his arms up.
Bamford with the relegation special 😂
BAMBI PLAYS WILLY DOESNT…..WTF IS GOIN ON AT THAT FOOTBALL CLUB???? GRACIA HASNT GOT A CLUE!!!!
Iheanacho deserve man of the match award for the performance and also for being able to push the ball to Madison despite the groin strain showed his commitment and determination to succeed. He deserve more mentions and credit. The boy is a Very good footballer.
Tellingbyounleeds players trying their absolute best to get themselves relegated
we’ll cleared bammy
Vardy annoying fans once again, Legend.
Crazy to think that the 2 disallowed Leicester goals and the Leeds missed sitter at the end are things that could culminate in either team potentially getting relegated this season
Awul miss but he was offside.
Have never rated Bampton his body language  tells you he dizzy want to play
oh willy gnonto where are you 😢
Barn Door Bamford on his right. Couldn't hit it from the inside.
That was a beaty of a miss
Leicester should have come away with the 3 points...both teams going to stay up if keep playing like this 👍
I think….. bamford may have been offside
Even if bamford scored it would have been ruled offside
Bamford and Maguire would be the perfect double act 😶
Fair play to Iheanacho, a lot of players would’ve gone to ground there before playing that pass to Maddison
I hate s**thousery generally, but when Vardy does it I just laugh.
Rocket League.  Player misses.       Player has left the game.
Bamford's Chelsea acadamy training kicking in...
As a Leicester fan I hope vardy stays at least one more year and we don't do to him what we did to schmeichel. The game changed in our favour when he came on he still has things to offer especially if we get relegated
Give Rutter a run out now, especially after Bamford missing that chance at the end..
Classic Patrick Bumfluff
How is it offside
Can we get rid of bamford already?
Bamford was offside anyways
Yes bamford should of finished that but it was offside surely
Don't think there's anything I trust less than Patrick Bamford's right foot
Bamford could always get a job cleaning Vardy's boots
So glad from a bournemouth fan it ended 1v1 WE ARE STAYING UP 😊
Remember when Leeds was obsessed with Villa 🤣 just here to say we are way bigger than you, and always finish on top 🤣👌 enjoy the championship next season 🍷
Cooper needs to stay off the pitch for the rest of the season please!
2:41 surprised bamford didn’t get injured kicking that post
That miss from Bamford could cost us Prem status. Tonight was a must win.
I want Everton to go down.
74 grand a week
Not enough people are mentioning iheanacho’s performances lately. Top class.
Gracia and Bamford both need to be sacked. Get rid! Why isn't Gnonto playing!!! He is our best player and an Italian International!!!!!! It was a huge mistake to sack Jesse Marsch. We are conceding a lot more with Gracia as manager who should have been sacked after the dreadful Palace and Liverpool games.
Tielemens outside the box on a corner is the most dangerous player on the pitch
AFTER 57 YEARS A LEEDS FAN . I  THOUGHT I NEVER SAY THIS UNTILL TODAY . SACK THE BORD . THE OWNERS THE PLAYERS , DEMOLISH THE GROUND .START .ALL OVER .AGAIN
WEDNESDAY FAN HERE LOVE IT WHEN VARDY SICKENS TEAMS, ESPECIALLY SHEFF UTD.
Also Bamford was offside for that chance he had so it wouldn’t of counted so your all moaning and having a go at Bamford for nothing🤣🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Iheanacho holding play despite the pain and making the killer pass saved Leicester in this game.
Bamford, what a sitter missed. Garcia, if you brought on Gnonto, we would have been 2-1 up.
Bye bye Leeds! With the run in you have in May!!  DOOMED! City, Newcastle, West Ham and Spurs…… Ha ha! ZERO POINTS THERE with the great Bamford up front missing sitters and a defence a leaky as a proverbial sieve!  DOOMED! Bye bye! 👋👇
Good. Leeds fans are scum so they deserve to go down. I have nothing against Leeds team but their fans have the wrong water in their cities system.
Am happy with the draw
Arsenal should sign Tielemans on a free contract at the end of the season, would be a great deal. Would give us some much needed strength in depth.
Bamford needs to get up to speed with the game
“Patrick Bamford sitter costs Leeds” - how many times has this been the case?
Leeds are falling apaaaaart again
MISS OF THE SEASON by Bamford
Bamford is the Harry Maguire of Leeds
Getting relegated with an in form Italian international sat on the bench, Leeds innit.
Bamford proving why chelsea let him go in the first place
Bamford was offside anyway.  Leicester first goal should have stood.
Bamford forgot to clip his toe nails that day and as such would have been offside after VAR looked at the incident for days.
Free Gnonto!
Even Darren Bent would have finished that
Lots of lame childish comments about Bamford on here. It’s not all about one player it’s about the team and the team as a whole is not good enough. The whole club needs sorting out to be honest starting from the top.
Bamford would have been offside
Good riddens to Leeds cannot wait to see em relegated 😂😂😂
Leeds paid more than 30 million on Rutter who cannot even get a game. They are struggling bigtime.
Serves ya right bamford
Bamford is done at this level
Smh! Bamford is a laughing stock, he's championship level at best! Leeds should sell him in the summer.
How has he missed that 💀
Tielemans got baby cheeks lol
Bamford 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
I wanted Leicester to win this game.
leeds going down
Leeds united big history in primer league ❤️💪
bamford is shocking rodrigo clear and javi not playing gnonto is discraceful
How is Bamford a footballer?
Bamford's miss is without excuse.
Tielemans loves a banger 🔥
Bad result for Leeds.
Bamford HA HA HA HA!!!!
Leeds hanging on by a thread.
Why do midfielders only score bangers? 😂
We leeds should have won
That tielemans goal is class
The genius that is Bamford, able to miss something that was easier to score from..
Bamford doing a Bamford
What a game! Love that Vardy scored again, shame we had a few offside goals but both were the right decisions. Leeds could've had some goals as well. Passionate players, we kept on fighting till the last minute but 3 points today for either side could've been vital to survive relegation. What an exciting game, Everton we move. COYF 🦊 (Also love how half of the highlights are from the final 20 minutes or so 😂)
Tielemens only scores bangers👏👏
iheancho injured, noooo. sad for him
It's sad to see vardy getting old he's so entertaining to watch
Bamford was so good at the back for Leicester today.
Who where the 2 players from each team  that pulled up with some sort of injuries on Vardys allowed goal
👋 bye Leeds 😂
Bamford’s a curse for the Whites 😂😂😂
VAR always dissapointing
Bamford’s a curse for the Whites 😂😂😂
Hahahah brilliant bamford😂😂😂😂😂
Maguire should be taking notes.
look at iheancho holding his bits and still manages to pass loool
Vardy is still the 🐐
Unlucky Bammer Boy
Glad to see Vardy getting the credit he deserves in these comments! Not a Leicester fan but he’s been an asset to the PL especially where he’s come from in his career.
Everyone sacked in the morning
We were very close to getting our annual tielemans screamer
If that tielemans strike counted maybe goal of season
Wasnt Bamford offside but still awful miss, we Spurs will let Leeds win last game of season.
the richmond cumberland boy showing why he has never made it at any of his past 15 clubs
Bamford missing a chance like that is definitely the highlight of the game
How. Has. He. Missed.
If Gnonto isn't injured Gracia should be sacked. Our most creative, skilful, calm player. Beats defenders, finds intelligent passes into the box even when surrounded, and scored classy goals....and in Italian international. But we play no hopers like Aaronson. Seriously. We were better under Jesse than this.
Leeds are too pure for the prem anyway so I don't really care at this point. Rather watch them play real football in the Championship.
Bamford offside anyway
That sitter he missed cost me £1300 😂😂😂😂
winning dos not affect the bottom line eds words cancel mutv do not buy from old trafford or any where else for that matter turn up in big numbers on the 30th hit the glazers in the pocket manchester united fans wot they think
Would probably have taken a draw from a Leicester point of view, but still... had chances to win it
What a peach of a cross for Leeds' goal.
Could be a huge point for the Blarmeh
Great defending by Bamford at the end there to stop Leeds from scoring the winner
Be great to see Leeds back at Portman Road next season, always good games
Get miniminter up front
I liked how vardy went up to the Leeds fans just to annoy them 😂
Something about vardy man, gives you goosebumps. Does everything with so much tenacity
Bamford doing what bamford does best
Unless gnonto is injured its baffling why he isn't on the pitch in a game like this.
Personally opinion. I'd want Southampton, Leeds and Everton to go down. But I'd want ward-prowse to leave Southampton as he is a premier standard player.
That might be the best ever disallowed goal! 😂
Although it was disallowed, let’s take a moment to appreciate that Tielemans strike 👏🇧🇪
What a stop from the Leicetser keeper, with his mug 😂
Great to see Vardy get another goal
what a player vardy is
Oh Paddy...
That tielemans disallowed goal is unbelievable!
imagine scoring that and having it disallowed
That miss could send Leeds down . . .
first
Tielemans knows how to strike a ball
It's all so tiresome.
Tieleamens Banger for nothing
First  Plz pin
great shot by bamford 🔥
