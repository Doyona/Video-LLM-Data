11:55 still makes me belly laugh 4 years later 🤣
My new Framework 13’s Speakers don’t work; Anybody got a solution?
Just 11:53
I've never wanted a laptop more than a framework, but they're too expensive for me :(
i like
gimme👍 chain
this feels like a weird suggestion and this video is so old but the touch could be added to the bezel on top of the screen separately somehow, would be very expensive
Framework is just the best. I don't think any other offering can compete
I've been looking for this exact concept for several years so I just went and ordered a 16" . I'd really like to see them to come up with a Cadillac so to speak something large and spacious but this will be a pleasure to build the other aspect I like about this occasionally I can't afford to buy a unit that I want 10 or 12,000 for a laptop it's not always an option for me so the upgrade ability  often ,is a factor for instance my house just burned down am I very expensive laptop did not survive and that's why I just ordered one
this is whatever the opposite of greenwashing is ❤‍🔥
Love my Framework! You still Canadian?? Or has Trump done a Putin! :D :D
I just got my Framework 13 laptop. Really excited about the future of the company :)
He's going to have to replace parts after all that love making.  :P
Bought mine two years ago. A few weeks ago my keyboard started acting a bit strange. Some keys on the right side have stopped being reliable. No problem. $39 later I've got a brand new keyboard in my system. Maintainence still holds strong. Could not be more satisfied.
Honestly, I hope they release an ARM platform soon.
What happened after 3 years?
One thing I don't like is the non-modular headphone jack because I use wireless headphones and also the only non-modular I/O should be a USB-C so that if you lose your modular dongles, you can still charge it and not soft brick your computer when the battery dies because you can't charge it.
The algorithm recommended this channel. I despise "eye catching" still frames, and I nearly dumped it because of the ridiculously over-the-top reaction shots, yet you did actually give me some useful information, like the ability to turn the battery off.  I realize it probably works, which is really you and almost everybody else does this, but I would really like to see less clownishness and more information.
Coulda jammed outta it😢
When i have the money in a few months to get myself a nice high end laptop i will 100% be going for a fully loaded Framework 16
Compared to my MacBook that framework is still thick, ugly, and not performant & outputs more heat & is worse in most ways (battery, display, trackpad) So no thx
Im still considering getting an m2200m to my older zbook 15 g1. 4800mq and 32 gigs of ram and 2 ssds...
Seeing if I can get one for college. I'm still impressed with the precedent the team at Framework are setting!
❤❤❤❤
I want the 2010 piece crap laptop (:
This is great if it become much better I will also buy it , Infact I bought a laptop a year ago and I'm starting to regret that a bit now. I'd love a much more upgradable laptop then i'm locked in.
I hate that i just found this. I havent even had my laptop a full year yet. I paid $100 less than what this one is going for, which ive enjoyed mine, but still. Ive recently went back to my older laptops that ive kept over the years and my oldest one doesnt have modern ports for anything. 1 usb and 1 sd with 2 ports dedicated to headset and mic inputs. If it was modular like this, id be able to instantly swap it to usb-c and id be in love.
Shame the hdmi expansion slot doesn’t output sound to many common ‘monitors’ such as LG TVs. Yes I have tried framework bundle drivers and also the intel graphics card latest drivers.
4 years later following them. Finally afforded one. Best laptop maker ever! Heck yeah!
just bought my first one
Linus: "Laptop CPU's are simply not available with pads on the bottom..."  Chinese salvagers: "You do not know the full extent of our power..."
if I need a new laptop... this is it
I have a Thinkpad T520 with linux and it's great.
this is actually such a good system! assuming theyre using standard DDR5 SODIMM, everything is a universal standard; USB-C. this is actually great like more companies need to take note of this
Things are looking up—vital refund info
Where can you find the cad drawings?
Framework with linux is gonna be the laptop with THE most freedom. Damm
ACTIVATE YOUR WINDOWS LINUS!!!
5 screws to open the bottom? I remember my old Dell laptop with only one captive screw and a sliding bottom that would take like a second to open and service. 😏
I should buy if i need
This is being smart ❤
"how creaky is your laptop?" *clicks by bending* (also this isnt a jab at framework its a jab at my laptop)
11:25 "and possibly even RISC-V in the future." Just hours ago they announced ther partnership with DeepComputing for a RISC-V mainboard on their 13 series :)
just need nvidia gpu in framework 🔥🔥🤠✌️
I was considering a framework laptop, then when I saw the 300usd off for the diy version I was slightly scared. I expected to have to screw in the mainboard and all that kind of stuff, but it's just adding ram.
Idea: bow downgrade your laptop
this is legit
Would b nice if pc were upgradable including the software
I’m going to buy one, I must, I’ve been looking for a good quality price of tech for programming, thank you Linus
Hey Linus can we get an updated video on this.
Hope it's available in South African, respect to the developers, for thinking about the customers.
I'm getting this soon once my current laptop becomes trash
11:33 go me rolling
Education over distrust, love it.
Linus: Sees clear keyboard Linus: turns into horror channel
day 1 of asking for an NZXT motherboard
can't wait for riscv or at least arm on this
900$
i want 4090 in it lol
theres a subtitle issue in 13:30
The idea is great. It would be more beneficial to both parties if the company name provided just the 'frame' for people to customize to there potential with other parts and then have the option for people with less time/need a laptop to get it custom built by the company. Most people who watch Linus know how to build tech things and only need the frame and not the guts.
I love the Framework, but I CANNOT justify $2,700 to replace my current laptop with it.
Framework is taking Toshiba's 10+ years old design with those captive screws i mean even tho there wasn't many captive screws on Toshiba's laptops trom 10+ years ago it still is very much appreciated
I have a (second hand) HP Elitebook x360. Gorgeous and light device. And besides the sothered on ram really easy to open and maintain. And spare parts are also available.  That said I'm really drawn to your 16 Inch Laptop as my next computer
i am watching this on a framework
I need one of those
Framework is still making good money because they sell a lot of parts for the laptop, but you can still of course use third party parts I believe
Please tell me someone told Louis Rossmann about this XD
One of my old laptops that I have now taken apart had hatch at the bottom specifically for the ram slots. I wish more modern laptops were upgradeable.
Laptops have gotten so bad in terms of easy end user repair. I am a regular viewer here, but have no other experience in computer assembly or repair, and my old hp laptop had 5 screws holding down the back panel, and the battery just had another 5. I bought a new one on ebay because the current was bad and fixed it myself super easily, but my mom asked me to do the same for her macbook and I couldn’t even get the thing open!
If I ever have enough money to get a laptop, this will be it
11:54 AHHGAHGHGAHGHHAGHAHG
Why the fuck didn’t it come in one piece?
watching this on a chromebook rn. ya know the least repairable crappy "laptop".
frame works are my dream laptops
11:53 LOL
They cool and seem very good but expensive
2 years later and they still leading the market. Big companies starting to attempt the same but not on their level. I got one and absolutely LOVE it. No issues, customer service, was very helpful when needed and still feels like a small family business when dealing with them. I swapped from an Asus ROG laptop to this. Speaks for itself.
I love that 2 years later FrameWork has only gotten better.
Everyone wants to invest in mars, directly and indirectly. Civilization on mars. Pool our resources to get it done sooner. Simple straightforward.
I just sat there realising a framework is genius and yet i still bought a desktop.  Not mad but mad at the fact i missed out an opportunity to learn more about systems.
if they add gpu's like the nividia ones then i'm buying it
If you want to be taken as anything other than entertainment (and even then it feels off), you need to divest from the products you review.
2 years, still goated.
Holy shit I'm sold
linus boi u must be gettin rich i literally  got 12 unskippable ads before this vid
Gotta love the intro remark “gimme”
I can justify spending 2-3 grand on a laptop that I can fully upgraded and configured to what I like
Hi Linus, I live in China and currently Framework does not ship to China or support Forwarders. I understand you’ve invested in the company, could you please suggest that Framework at least support forwarders. Would really love to get my hands on one of those bad boys.
Wasnt composter savvy but i remember owning a latitude laptop that i loved and was easy to upgrade. May it rest in peace.
I love frameworks way of elegant but upgradeable
11:35 *_and fail to deliver (cough) Dell_*
Oh man the way he handles laptops in the air while talking, is so cringe.
Review on acer nitro V for gaming fps and gpu tdp
We need a laptop that can be upgraded like pc
Ehememe dell.
Doo-dad-a-majigs here😂
Guys, we found apples biggest enemy, BEST LAPTOP EVER!!!
I want this
A laptop if it was made like a custom pc. I can’t stop loving it
they should make an Ubuntu one
As someone commenting from a framework laptop I agree.
I keep hoping Frameworks will go public. I want to buy stock into them.
This should probably be my next laptop upgrade 😂
Wow, this is the coolest product i've seen in years! The fact that you can literally customize ANYTHING on it while keeping the setup slim and compact is just amazing. 10/10 points for this one!
does it work for gaming?
11:55 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
green motherboard= slow and terrible black motherboard= fast and sleek
why am i actually so touched by the QR codes hey integrated in the components TT
To me, right to repair is less about "Oh, you can't have this product" or "If you want to repair it, there's other options out there" and more about getting rid of bullshit systems companies have in place to prevent you from working on your own product that you bought. Framework is doing it right, by giving you the documentation and clarity about what they use and how to go about doing it yourself. It's more about telling the consumers "Hey, here's what you need and the guidance to do it."
also. you can bring your own OS to download... so that save at least $40...
Also to be fair while it’s not my cup of tea and I’d rather buy tha Apple device and pay them to fix it but \things like the battery where it may be smaller the life will be better after 2 years because you can replace it easily so more people will do it
I'm definitely gonna be looking into this for when I need a new laptop
discloseyour investment dude
i mean, who's stopping you from using this in your phone?
10:44 that aged well
Now all we need is a gpu unit and it's freakin upgradable. I swear many laptop company's would kinda need to switch their manufacturing scheme
15:31  I can GAURANTEE you that Apple ESPECIALLY will go after Framework if a mag charging module IS created, because Apple is petty like that and is probably looking for a way to ruin Framework.
10:44 Framework took him up on that offer.
that is a very well made laptop, I can see this laptop living for the next years to come with more options, as 2023 there's a lot more options available   the framework joke got me LOL for a while
take that apple
If they had it in a mobile workstation dope oh and a thinkpad keyboard and thinkpad hinges allowing the screen to go 180°
Its like my t480
@LinusTechTips I feel they could make it better by just making is upgradable and remove the quick swap option. The parts should be modular but they do not need to be atached using magnets and don't need to be slide in. It should be such that you can disassemble it and upgrade any part quickly. This will make the build quality better and lower cost
Love the concept.  Any prospects to upgrade the monitors to 4k or 5k ?
you and screwdriver, your are not allowed
Apple is a sc*mbag company.
It's still not viable, it costs twice the price of a regular laptop with the same configuration. It's not worth paying all that just to have an upgradeable or repairable laptop
The only issue I have with this company is that they can't ship here in the Philippines
I wish i could buy this Computer, but I‘m a Mac user.
There are these magnetic USB C cabels, you could just plug them into the Computer, or 3D Print an Expansion Card with a little board in it to have something like a Magsave Expansion Card.
11:54 who edited this 😂😂
that little message from the creators brought a tear to my eye. In a world where corporations are two-faced (trying to rip us off by cheaping out but then having a jolly cute attitude about what they do) it's so nice to see some real humanity behind a high-end product. Cheers! PD: its actually because of Canadian taxation that most companies have Canadian websites. They get slapped with a HUGE tax for international stuff. You guys think you're so civilized, getting ripped off by your commie govt. You're not. :)
My god, this is beautiful for a person with no assembly knowledge. Bravo
Wow a modern 10:10 take on a t440p awesome
Can I directly use those type c ports without IO modules ? I am trying to say can I remove any IO modules and directly plug type C device where the IO module sit?
I don't know if anyone else would want this but I would absolutely love a computer with cellular and with framework it would be so easy!!
11:50 why the hell would they edit it like that
11:53 linus ARG tips
take this video down.  keep your money separate from your content.  dont boost your investment by monetizing your bias.  cashing in on selling out, are you sure you're not American?😊
PC Master don't let this thing flop
I love the idea but it costs too much. Went on the site and speced out something resembling a dell xps that sells for 1k, and the framework was 2k at max (no upgrade room in terms of CPU or RAM). Again, I love the idea and the movement. I do think this is commercially viable, but not like this. Gotta bring the prices down.
Not 3 hours ago I just ordered a new ASUS laptop and then this runs across my youtube.  Thanks Linus.  I feel terrible now.  😂
And of course the phone was dropped (judging from the broken back glass)
I need a upgrade for gpu and cpu
this is quite literally making it user friendly. AMAZING STUFF MAN!!!😍😍
so cute Linus.
There is a DIY fixable Nokia phone which lends itself to this... Google it
Im finally old enough to get a job this summer, im gonna buy this so i can make more games and vids! Im excited!   Edit: for the specs i want as well as the interchangeable stuff, i think il go with a 1000 dollar laptop with 16 gbs and 1 tb and a 3080 ti or whatever i havr to look at it again  Edit 2: i actually looked at they diy section and it was about 300 to 400 cheaper then the prebuilt one, so i will choose that (if my parents let me cayse even if i work for my money my dad will find a way to complain like "get a pc, it doesnt matter about portability" or "thaats a stupid purchase. I dont want you buying that." Even though i put a bunch of research into what i want, lyckily my mom doesnt mind as mich, as long as she knows i truly put research into it.)
Share they don't sell it where I live. Would have loved to buy one
When Linus said performant, how performant? does it get the same, similar or better performance than other laptops in it's class? like 4090 and 13th gen intel performance?
Wow! Finally! A modular Notebook; the service on a similar board that may need to be sent back to the company to be upgraded might not be a bad idea, if it still has to be soldered into a custom board, making that process customer friendly is the next step. We have 3d printers, and allowing people to print their own motherboards that can accept soldering is the next revolution. That sounds like a project the MakersMuse might like.
How to use a repairable Mac... 1. Get this laptop
genuinely good company with genuinely good products, if i every need to buy a laptop, i already know i will buy from them
Can’t wait for them to make a gaming centered model with the same amount of upgradability.  I don’t need THIS amount of customizability, but I would LOVE the customizable port selection bit.
Im really impressed! Framework, this it what ive been looking for for EVER. I cant afford it, but I will one day:)
Can't wait for a gameish 16" laptop form them
the market is kinda small for good and modular laptop,  they need to market themselves as customizable and pre-built laptop for idk designers? artist? coder? gamer? that on the long run have some good upgradability EDITED: after watching Linus recent latest video on framework (April), yes they kinda did what I hope, good repositioning. Hope they became big and global
are the modules hot pluggable?
11:56 Cought me off guard.
They are $1000Aud would’ve been nice to get one but out of my price budget…
great idea and kudos to Framework team!
I wish they were shipping to NZ a little while ago, had to go with an ASUS because I couldn't get one of these beauties
Hahaha i just got this ad from you of the "ABC of Gaming". That is absolutely hilarious 😅
no space for GPU?
Apple is fighting a hard and ongoing battle against consumers so that they cant repair or upgrade their devices. Even their Mac Pros come with as many unnecessarily custom parts as possible while still getting their hardware from Intel, AMD, Asus etc. The rest of the Industry watches apple getting away with this even becoming the most valuable company in the world and they learned from it. The screwed ones are us.
Bro I had a Nokia with a flashing Ariel
"Installing macOS on the framebook laptop"
New one is out
The design is cool af
I need a new laptop seriously considering one of these :)
"next, next, next, like some sort of monkey" that aged well.
These guys if they don't get shut down. Are apt to slick take over  this is genius
Update: almost 2 years later they're more upgradable than ever. They now support amd 7000 and intel 13th gen motherboards to swap, and louder speakers, bigger battery upgrade, a matte screen option, and theyre dropping a 16 inch with even more customization
Probably my next laptop
... they just announced the Framework Laptop 16 with Ryzen 7040 series support (specific model yet to be announced).  I am unreasonable excited about the option of a centered keyboard, and never understood why Lenovo didn't do that that as an option on their P series.
TrackPoint please!
I'm almost hoping my Razer Blade 15 dies soon.  I want a framework.
Anyone willing to collab on making the magnetic connector? I’m pretty much going to do it for selfish reasons of having it for myself, but if others can use it that’s a plus
If they could get in an ultra budget model somewhere under $300 they'd be killing it. To someone with not a lot of money and option to buy something inexpensive and be able to upgrade later is a no brainer
You got me worried by the way you handle it. Be gentle 😀
Гавно обзор! У меня чуть эпилепсия не началась от часто ты смены ракурса. Если ты что то обозреваешь, то я хочу видеть то что ты обозреваешь а не твои кривляния!
sounds like a great product, well thought out and what we really need in todays markets. the only thing I can pick at are things like having a touch screen and foldable option.
if you want to touch your screen so much why even bother getting a laptop/pc if you can get a wintab
Interesting laptop but seriously, the soy is stroooong in this dude.   Young men, please do not model your behaviour after this guy. Do not use a highly pitched girly voice like him, do not under any circumstances do the girly faux surprise gaping mouth. Go work out, build some muscle. Have a cleanly shaven face to separate yourself from the soy boys who made a beard their trademark.  I'll order a framework laptop now.
how do you say completely? you know people really wants? upgradable cpu and gpu and ram and 99.9% of the consumers cant access it. because even if the laptop is elegant its getting outdated sooner and later and new ultra high end games come. what are you going to do of course throw away your laptop.
Aux cables will outlive the computer lol
Long useless advertising. 18 minutes spent for nothing. Keywords have been spelled: IF company survives in 2 years.
So cool! Changing your whole motherboard for like 300$ instead of buying a whole new laptop after 4 years or maybe even more... Maybe later using some discret gpu with it... This thing really has to survive because it could really give a lesson to the whole industry firing the price of their laptops just because "it's a laptop so it's more expensive"
Framework sales after this 📈 And  MacBook sales after launch of this 📉 😂
I find this revolutionary. Ability to choose what ports you need on a laptop is supreme
I think the 'concept' for the framework laptop is cool, but it won't go big. There's no way they can compete with the ever growing technology without: outside investing.   Me: I'll never buy one, ever. I have no use. The specs I need for rendering music requires much more beefy specs.   The use: business laptop  Pros-  Easily repaired , somewhat upgradable (which is great compared to others), and it's a laptop  Cons-  The ones that are actually affordable use chromeOS which is The Worst OS. Likely poor battery life for work flow, because batteries this era are terrible (could maybe change it to Linux, which I recommend due to the fact Linus is open source and better than chrome OS.  Also, there's a lot more to my reasoning.. but, I think in the future of this framework business if still around and had money they would be able to adapt.   I think it is also overpriced generally. But I wish all of you luck regardless.
(those excuses never held any weight in the first place btw lol, my very first laptop back in 2014 was fully upgradeable and i did indeed upgrade the RAM, ROM, and batteries of my first 2 laptops, both lenovos, and they didnt look weird or bulky)
just marvelous!
what if i just duct tape a itx board, monitor and gpu together
Their professional version (i7 12th gen) costs over 2K USD. Just too expensive.
I thought the sponsor was a gaming pc coffee maker by the shape
Wow , I think I can do some anatomical upgrade to my old laptop using their components. I think I used Bio word for tech.
I am 95% sold, I am hoping you guys would attempt a Hackintosh on it and if all works fine, I would GRAB one!
at 7:54 Linus says it perfectly. if you let bygones be bygones, maybe someone will come along the way and fix it- but in reality, until that one person "cares", no one does.
ok, but what if they made custom keyboards that you customize on their website that costs a little more than a normal keyboard
As someone who uses a laptop all the time I'd rather have a super thick laptop if it didn't overheat every 5 s
It is now a lot more expensive tho (€1,199 rn)  Edit: the DIY version is slightly less Edit 2: once you add the basic stuff, it's not cheaper. Also stuff can be out of stock
it seems to be quite a bit more expensive than a standard version of the same laptop and upgrade path seems a bit limited
I purchased this a week ago, I configured it myself with all the parts I want with it before the order. And it arrived in 5 in day. Happy with this laptop,  never-ever would want any other laptop, it was love at first sight .
This is a great idea and others should follow their lead. Impatiently waiting for a 15, 16 or 17" version. A real video card would be great wish list item. Never been a fan of the whole on chip design.
i smell nederlands
11:44 what just happened lmao
This is an absolute game changer for laptops
Right to repair: exist John deere: hehe im in danger
This looks like heaven when compared to every other laptop I've worked on!
I have a gaming laptop that I was lucky enough to upgrade the RAM and SSD without doing something wrong. Lol. Don't know much about the insides or if this company has one already but I'd definitely ditch my current laptop for one if they had one powerful enough for gaming since that's what my gaming laptop is mostly used for. Hope this company is here to stay. This is definitely a change then the standard laptops that you pretty much buy and ditch after they get old and slow 😁🤣
It's even worse than Dell Latitude, where you can plug in 2.5 SATA HDd, ssd and dvd-rw  drive simultaneously. fully upgradable memory. Easy changeable battery bunch of IO things like VGA, HDMI, LAN, cardreader, 3.5mm jack availability to dock it to even more increase io. That's all in a compact 14' notebook with very nicely done metal case
if we buy new one and then buy upgrade everything piece by piece teknicly we just have new laptop and old one
11:53 .... why.  I'm laughing my ass off
im definitely getting one of these, this is so cool.
4:20 yo that lapyop is mad trippy
still not in India its been 2 years 😥
It's the age old disposable vs. repairable. Both have their pros and cons. Would you prefer to still be driving 1970 family sedan as your primary commuter?  Planned obsolescence and disposable help foster advancement.  For a pretty good example consider automotive safety systems and devices.  There are probably things in regard to that most people aren't even are aware of.  Like crunch zone.  Yes they make the vehicle less durable.  But they save a lot of lives and reduce a lot of injury severity.  Yes we are talking about a computer here but some of the same principles apply.  And like techbio mentioned.  The big difference is with the modules and motherboard upgrade.  Most notebooks have had up-gradable memory, storage (HDD/SSD) and WiFI for a long time.  Largely due to industry standardization. That's nothing new.  To me it would be appealing for high end notebooks to protect the larger outlay $$$ from becoming a paper weight due to some failure. High end is not just measured in terms of processing performance.  But also by the feature set.  Like Large touch screen with active stylus.
One module bay is pretty much dedicated for power/charging.  Leaving only 3 for "real" usage.  Should either have 6 bays or a dedicated charging port aside from the 4 bays.  Power/charging is something every computer needs.  Give it a dedicated port.  Could even be a swap-able module for various physical power connection form-factors.  For instance USB-C, 3.5mm barrel, etc.
Small screen, no touch, no active stylus, no go. For premium price it must have 15.6" screen, touch and active stylus.  Otherwise it's a non starter at those prices.
The only significant appeal of this compared to existing laptops is the modular swappable units. HP, Dell, Lenovo etc can all be opened easily enough and memory, battery, wireless cards and storage swapped out. But being able to add hdmi, display port etc, change number of usb-c ports and so on, is very innovative. However you are still locked into the manufacturer for modules. What I'd like to see is swappable modules that you can mount your own mini pci-e cards in. So you can buy pci-e cards from any source and install them in the module and plug directly into the module port on the laptop. That would be true platform independent upgradeability and customisability.  That said I'm not dissing in this laptop, it's very appealing and something I will consider when I reach the end of the upgrade path on my current HP 11th Gen laptop.
I've watched this video a couple times just because it was interresting, and now, I think Linus has convinced me I want this even though I am not going to buy it anytime soon because I just bought the GDP pocket 3. It was between a GDP laptop, and the Dell XPS for a while there and now I'm adding the framework to my list of favorite laptops, kind of like a cool car a might someday own.
Sadly, this is too expensive for my paycheck.
what's the audio quality like
Didn't Mercedess almost bankrupt themselves by building too efficient cars? same logic here - you want to make good products, but also sell next generations too.
I remember back in the 80's, 90's 00's and 10's when computer manufacturers sold their products as futureproof I love the idea of modularity, however it  comes at a price. Not having to make random components compatible and not having to make interposers for those modular clip in add-ons is how manufacturers can bring a product as powerful as this for LESS than half the price  I know we have a responsibility to the planet but not enough people give a shit or are willing to sacrifice the bang for buck saving of consumer laptops from Dell etc and lets be honest here, people buy new laptops for many reasons, not just because they need or want one specific features  I remain unconvinced
If more people buy the more companies will start releasing laptop components and no longer lock us with external storage and some ram. Ground breaking
I would definetly buy a gaming laptop from them, if I would be able to upgrade it as the time goes by
Hope this thing will catch up like the original IBM PC and force everyone to adopt some standard.
One piece
This is the 11 right
"@Linus Tech Tips" time to revisit this company in 2 months...
Cool
I gotta interact for the algorithm on this one. It's just gold.
I love wired instead of wireless mouse because of instant transfer to the device and accuracy is everything besides I don't have to worry about battery's.
Completely upgradeable laptop would have option to replace cpu/gpu at same TDP range CPU's/GPU's ... FAKE!
Well back in the days Steve Jobs was obsessed about perfection, he wanted every sigle part of mac to be perfect even the parts you can't see. So, the excuse "is on the back of the laptop it doesnt matter, no one could see" will not work for apple products.
Hey! My place of work sponsored you!
My only complaint is the TouchPad, I really like having separate click buttons for the mouse clicks. Otherwise I'd definitely use this.
When thay go whit 360 hinges ill get one deffenetly
As a laptop repair technician - let me tell you.  Buy from framework.  They are absolutely worth it
It must have been the former apple engineers who decided it didn't need to come with a charger.
Anyone know what the computer at 0:13-0:14 is?
you can tell they were from apple, its so obvious, it even looks like a mac
first I thought this is just another little startup trash company, after seeing the qr-codes and extra screws, im fully convinced
Why do you need the usb c isn’t the module connected via type c
What happened to project aria?
I'm sad about mobile CPU's being soldered on. My old Dell 1735 had an upgradeable CPU, and I did just that, swapped in the fastest CPU that the MOBO could support. Made a world of difference. My new ThinkPad runs circles around the old Dell, but I cannot upgrade from an i5 to an i7 without switching the entire MOBO. Bummer.
If IKEA makes a laptop.
no numerics, hard pass
Your affirmation that CPU modulars (anymore maybe but used laptop market can serve you right,there are options from the manufacturers who still support the idea) with any power to their computing arent available anymore is untrue, most of mine even the shitty 11 year old gateway got modular processors and I upgraded all of mine with SSDs recently and just recently adding a CPU onto the 11 year old running gateway that got overheating issues (used 30 cad ebay CPU should do the trick). The name of the companies I use the laptops of are Gateway and Dell for the harder access laptops although they got easy ram and hard drive bay access (you gotta pop the fuckin keyboard out for the motherboard access and usually remove a bajillion cables). Hp laptops and presumably my asus got easy access hatches even a step further easier than razor and this because ... This is still a top-hatch easy access system, which is not as good as say, my elitebook 8440p with its underside easy access to motherboard, ram, CPU ,GPU, heatsink, fan and its hard drive and I already popped the CD dvd bay for a second hard drive bay. Its a bottom hatch that got FLIPPING TAB SWITCHES you simulatenously pull to open slide the panel, its frickin great, does have a tiny 1 gb vram gpu with a 1gbish width bus or so or something akin but with proper storage unlike the 500 gb crap hdd I bought it with it is actually a pretty decent pre 2015 games PC.  Top hatches are the bane of my existence, why the fuck you guys develloping laptops make it so you gotta pop the keyboard at all, well, at least this is a top easy access, my dell and gateway laptops are hard access bottom motherboard one so I gotta unplug everything topside then reach my hand under an inch of space with wires attached to the bottom. Nightmarish and frustrating I hope I never do solder needing damage reassembling em, at least, I gotta change that gateway CPU soon.
sold me, will save up
At first, I thought what laptop I need for my university study after finals. Now, I’d say this is the only laptop I’d even CONSIDER if uni doesn’t give one for FREE. I’d pay for the philosophy behind electronics and the ability to repair them. I’d even hope repairability and upgradeability becomes mandatory by law!
what are the editors on? and can i have some?
You act like a clown!
Why aren't there gaming laptops like that?
This is the next upgrade... 3 screens DIY. Linus please do a react
As someone who loves fixing and upgrading instead of throwing away, you just made an 18 minute ad on this product. I think my next Laptop will be one like this.
Activate Windows.
Meh / ya ok. Chrome OS Flex anyone?  OpenCore Legacy Patcher is running Ventura on my 2012 mbp quite well.
There was a phone like this if I remember right. It was kinda a few years ago, sadly we all know what happened to them. It was a great idea and a really environment friendly unlike Apple no charger thing.
Bring OLED screens on these and I might get exited as well as other people out there.
*gets me hyped about framework* "they're hiring people" Me: OOOOOOOH
CPU still cannot be replaced = useless crap
Doesn't ship with Linux preinstalled. I'll stick to System 76.
This is amazing
that keyboard is hideous
*coughs* dell🤣🤣
time will tell and since time has passed, where is it now in the consumer facing mindshare of what to use, why it matters and who it's really for?  Some in the forums said it'd go the way of the phonebloks
if the motherboard had a daughter board with the CPU and RAM, like the Macintosh Powerbook G3 Lombard, you could use all of the same internals with just a CPU/RAM upgrade
The only problem I have with it is that I want amd processors in this thing and I’m curious on how it games or if it has a discreet GPU
*AHEM DELL* - I started cry laughing!
This is the coolest laptop Ive ever seen, literally designed with love.
It's easily modify-able because your components will die in a year from those temps
i bought a gaming laptop because I wanted a desktop replacement that I could carry with me when needed, so it's powerful enough to do other things like programming or whatever. But I am seriously considering getting a framework laptop and putting linux on it to use specifically for programming and computer hardware tinkering. plus these would be awesome for schools/universities to have as upgradable and fixable, rather than the macbooks/surfaces that last a year before being destroyed by kids and needing to be disposed
The first laptop review I’ve watched completely - literally. If I ever get around to admit to myself, that I need a laptop, it will be a Framework 😂!
It looks like only 13 in size is available, and just integrated graphics. I'm not a gamer, but gpus are just too important for accelerating a lot of productive software these days. Otherwise, the product seems pretty great, and the price isn't unreasonable. Overall, the reparability of these doesn't seem much better than my $500 8th gen i5 asus laptop, though better documentation for sure and better components. I guess the more you pay for a laptop, the less diy you get.
With this I would probably just get rid of the trackpad stuff since I like a mouse then stick a wrist rest onto there instead
I wish that they would make a studio book one type laptop
I might get my dad this he has a old crappy samsung laptop from 2010
I mean, DELL sounds like the 12th letter of the alphabet, and the name itself has 2 of them, so...
I like how framework put this video on there website so cool
Hello, Brazilian here. As a third world person I would REALLY LOVE to have a piece of technology that a could upgrade instead of buying a new one, sadly a framework laptop it's just too expensive, but without a doubt I'm really happy that everyone is buying, I WILL wait patiently for the company to grow and lower their prices. The future is bright.
It’s proof that it isn’t just the technology and the way things have gone, we can still live in the same world of fixing things that we used to decades ago. It’s all just been an illusion. If this team can do this, why couldn’t Apple? Answer - they could. 100%. The customers true happiness isn’t in mind though, it’s becoming the most expensive company in the world that matters.
11:54 what was this part
Dislike for screaming in my ear... sound warning !
I nead a frame phone
what kind of gpu is in it?
I am planning to BUY one once i get the 1200$  it has performance,  Changeable I.O (which is huge for my work) And the fact that a 6 year old could repair the thing is insane (My old laptop a chrome book had soldered many things permanently to the board to prevent repairs) And of course its a laptop which i need
“The dells not even F$&@ing thinner!”
nevermind
where do i buy that?
15:19 hmmmmmmm sounds like a good business idea 😁😁
I've had two issues: first, holding it up at odd angles compresses the chassis in a way that presses the buttons on the mousepad. Second, the included charging cable is trash. I had to replace it after about 4 to 6 months of use (I picked up a 10 ft. Braided usb c to c cable instead of rebuying).  Others, as a college student who mostly uses their laptop to take notes and occasionally play Factorio (for very long sessions), it's great.
Ye but you got max of 4 ports wchich is not a lot
My MSI GT83VR has almost all of these functionalities in terms of upgrades! Granted it wasn't as affordable and near upgradable with the available components buts its lasted me almost 5~6 years already!
11:57
This is literally what i want wtf
The ability to easely swap the keyboard alone makes this product very atractive in my eyes, knowing how easy it can be to ruin a keyboard with a spilled drink. My lenovo legion y520 has dead key, and i would have to litterally disasemble the entire machine, including removing the heatsink which mean also automatic repasting of the chips, and then break plastic rivets to extract the keyboard and glue a new one in. Alternatively, I could swap the entire front plate with the still functionnal trackpad, and that is a minimum 120€, with shipping. So instead of all that nonsense, I am using a 15€ USB keboard for now.
I would consider this if it had one or two more expansion slots and a dGPU, hope they come out with something like that soon
"Thanks" I just ordered a laptop and am so geeked out and excited!
Can the display can be replace?
I have the Fairphone 4, I honestly love it.
I never realized until now how annoying Linus' high pitch voice is
genius
Was good and informative until he dropped some profanity, especially the F bomb.  Not going to be watching in the future.
Once they get powerpc in those things, ill buy one!(risc-v)
When will they ship to Belgium? Can't wait to put one together ^^
Love it but the logo is so bad and generic. I really hope they change it.
I'd probably give them a try the next time I buy a new laptop, but that'll be in a few years. Hope they're still going.
My current laptop is like a Volvo, it just won’t die. But when it does, I will be happy, because I can buy one of these
My Acer from 2014 is super easy to upgrade both the hard drive and RAM. It's a real bummer I can't upgrade the cpu. I'd be the happiest man alive if I could put a faster cpu in it.
Very affordable, 2k for an i7, absolutely fucking ridiculous
An unmentioned plus side of this laptop: the Framework team which makes it (as mentioned on the battery) is PRIDDY gender balanced! 8 women and 10 men. On their site the team is not AS even, but still quite even 21 vs 17 women. Can't always tell by the name how they identify ...  To paraphrase Usain Bolt: Not bad .... for a tech company! 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂 ;-)  ;-)  ;-)  ;-)
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
No dedicated graphics card yet
This company is great, there are other startups that offer linux such as tuxedo too. But we need those 2 in 1 laptops to become available from someone other than the big laptop companies.
11:53 Linus moment
I am impressed. Really nice! Will research if they have something to my liking
My son somehow just destroyed his HP Pavilion after just 16 months of service. At the very least it needs a new trackpad, a new display and new top cover. I can't find any way to buy these parts from HP. HP does provide a bunch of YouTube videos on disassembling and reassembling the PC but parts? No idea. The PC works fine except the trackpad and display.  It was very easy to find these parts on Framework's website and it would cost about $280 for the parts. And it's awesome that you can take the internals and make a desktop PC out of it.  I'm sold
I was just describing something very similar to this to a friend that I've said I've always wanted something like this for years, and I had no idea it was real. Please let this become the standard for laptops and phones. This is perfect
Got mine a few days ago. It's definitely the coolest thing I've ever owned. The trackpad is not great, but I'm literally not even concerned because when a new, better one comes out I can just .. swap it! It's so cool!
This is really good work from them, and all the effort they've put with the qr codes to make things easier for people who will tinker with it, amazing. I think most laptops should be built in a similar fashion, modular, accessible and easy to fix. Apple is a joke, I mean, yeah, your macbook air is broken get a new one? And people accept this? If you have a problem with your car, you don't just go out and get a new one. Or with any device that is expensive, like a fridge, or a washing machine. Why should computers be different? Most of these devices are very expensive already and in the case of apple, way overpriced as well. Anyway, I wish them luck, good effort!
was this guy in it at some point
So My birthday I was sick and I decided to binge youtube, then I finally watch this video after it sitting in my recommended for weeks, and I find I can afford this for myself and that theres is a "build it yourself" model meaning I can also do my favorite hobby at the same time as having an insane upgrade over my macbook pro from 2009 that I've been using for 5 years. Thank You Linus, This is the best birthday gift ever!
Hoe do you feel about it now?
Great laptop definitely hound consider upgrading from my hp elitebook revolve and the fact I could have usb a on the right is great as I use apples hated hockey puck mouse so I need a usb a port on the back or right due to the short cable
A little larger screen and a spacious chassis than this with motherboard/CPU/GPU upgradability would just start the trend of “Modular Upgradable Laptops” - That would be insanely good
I’m not in the market for a laptop right now, but when I am, I know who I’m going to for my purchase. This is everything I want out of a pc company.
Can't wait to take this to class for note taking then on a trip with an external GPU and play some games on it when the time comes
finally e waste reducing ideas
Love this, took a look at their website, out of my price range at present. But this is one to remember.  Great video.
Framework and JustPhone should come together to create the ultimate user friendly tech company
I bet they'd make a killing if they designed a gaming llaptop
how to upgrade macbook pry the back plate off unsotter the ram if its the model that has the ram soldered on the motherboard resotter it glue the back plate on
PCMCIA says Hello.
Damn the specs and pricing of that laptop just isn’t worth the price 💀
Can we have it designed to run dual channel memory?
I’ve often wondered why no one has build a modular motherboard for pcs.. I googled it today and found it was an aprils joke a while back but why has no one ever built a modular motherboard it must be possible..
Aright...ready to order
Replaceable with hardware of same framework things... Modular yes. Cheap at long term, i am not sure
11:56 when you so excited you turn into zoo tycoon 1 mamooth
I'd still love this device even if it would be quadrupled the thickness cause this is just useful and awesome
I'm going to change those QRCodes when I inevitably buy one of these
Eu so queria ganhar em dolar pra comprar um desses kk
I really do hope this company succeeds ❤️
0:37 THE ONE PIECE
I was so surprised about the camera lmao
bro the editing on this is hillarious
I feel like a boomer because I got flashbacks of the ThinkPads/dell precision lineup.
All of my laptops are used unstill the get old and then are turned into a Linux IOT DEVICE LOL
You didn't buy that segue at the beginning... You sold it to G.Skill.
My laptop doesn’t even have screws to take the backplate off, it just has a single latch that you slide open and then take the backplate off.
I click on the video and the ad i get was IT management with "ft linus tech tips" what a coincidence
There is one thing that I miss about older and thicker laptops, they have better cooling. I wonder why cooling in laptops have gotten worse?
Hi! Jesus the Son of God is coming soon so repent of your sins and if you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Jesus from the dead you my friend will be saved avoiding an eternal hellfire. *Romans 10:9 KJV* 🌷🌷
if only it didn't cost 1200 dollars, which is surprising because its not really worth it to buy a laptop for 1200, spend around 900 for the parts but maybe it is cheaper compared to the average lifespan of a hp envy for example
i kinda have a laptop myself and the problem with it that they have just stopped manufacturing some parts for it, like the back cover for example. My back cover has cracked in many places and i cant even replace it alongside with 1 broken USB port, a battery (because the cover will likely completly crumble if i take it off 1 more time) broken camera and microphone, and basically every port cracked that i just cant replace
still on pre order :{
ALL of use should post this link on facebook & twitter this company needs to take over the notebook market
Thought it would be cheap. :(
I'm glad youtube added zoom so I can see what the hell hes actually holding
I like how Linus *didn't* mention about the benefit of others building adaptors for the laptop
The problem with razer’s concept is that computers are already modular, so why waste your money on something with a limited modularity of components when you can literally just MAKE ONE at home if you want it modular.
Having à desktop version of this and gaming parts for it and the laptop would make them more money.
wish they had a thicker gaming centered model with moar modular ports and room for higher end components   like imagine 3TBs of storage being just a small space on the machine,  having space for large controller adapters (like for gamecube), a usb-a and dual hdmi ports and being able to have that on just one side leaving the other one open for whatever else you could think of, plus a thick laptop looks better imo
I want be able to exchange the CPU and GPU on a laptop like you can in a desktop
One question? How is gaming on it? I am rocking a 2012 macbook pro on Linux mint 20.3, and yes I tricked it out with the look I love about Mac OS and the much loved user functionality of windows. Its a frankenstein to say the least, but I love it either way. I have upgraded the ram from 4 gb to 8 and swapped out the old HDD for an SSD equivelant in storage.Thats the only hardware upgrades fro almost 10 years of ownership. I know that my baby won't live forever and I am on the market. This company looks like what I am looking for, but I wanna know if I can run Witcher 3 or Doom (the new ones) on it with blowing it up?
What up with a labtop and try to be thin and forgot about heat management....
I want this, But it wont survive.
...This is nice!
"comapared to buying the preassembled one, you are almost surely going to find it worth it to assemble it yourself for the $300 of savings" and what about the ssd and ram that you have to buy seperately?
a lot of laptops have soldered on ram and not much.   Ram expansion and choice is huge.
Be hold the best user friendly laptop of all existence
tell me you guys will make a Serial port expansion, not a urat rs232 but a dedicated serial port
How much for this laptop, and where to get.
Only thing I don't like about this laptop company is they only offer it in a tiny, miniscule size. I have a work provided laptop in the same 13.5 inch diagonal screen size and I have to put it on a docking station so I can have two large desktop monitors hooked up to it! Any time I have used it by itself I always hate the smallish screen and keyboard that is too small to type on, at least for me. Overall, most folks past the age of 50 can't see tiny sized screens very well. I'm waiting for a larger size to be offered or it's a no buy for me, sorry. Everything else about this laptop is sheer genius.
Is that a USB C port to USB C port?
I was considering buying one of these as a laptop in the summer, though decided to give it a few more years to see whether theyre really worth it
Imagine if only, in the future there will be a version where its assembled and is made for gaming. Like imagine the customizablity of a desktop but on a mobile laptop.
9:20 Watch the computer expert plugging the white wire to the pin pointed by the black arrow, and the black wire to the pin pointed by the white arrow :-P
Around 2012 is when I felt like we started going -to- thin for our own good. Things don't need to be this small or this light. I would prefer to have hardware that can breath.
Don't trust him, he is an investor.  (Just kidding he obviously invests because he believes in it)
I’m all for it but it’s kinda expensive.
Are the "chip" like mods allowed or rated for very many changes or switches/swaps from say USB c to display port?
I'm sorry but why do people like small slim computers I always think that's really ugly.
Disclaimer: Linus is invested in Framework Laptop
I hope this company gets bigger than Apple
half the fun of computing is the tinkering. when I get a new computer the first thing I want to do is open it up. apple might have mades my computer but once I paid my money I should be able to repair and tweak it as I see fit, apple does not see it that way!
11:57 Im still dying from laughter xd
The concept is great however the Framework products are expensive.
Apple want just money and tonhavebretarded buyers 😂😑
Niceeeee 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
My work pc is a framework laptop
16:14 But, by default, there's no way to toggle battery disconnect from within an OS?  Might there be a utility for Windows and/or Debian to do this?  If not, is that because it's not even possible for such a utility to work while the system's fully booted up like that?
the only problem i have with them is they look like apple products and I personally prefer the look of android and windows devices
I want one.
if they want to stay in business and focus on longevity, start working with seeking a local distributor in major countries around the world.  make it available in every major region in the world, not just USA/Canada.
Upgradeable laptops, meh, so much of a laptop's purchase is the aesthetics.
4:52 Guess what Apple spends their billions of R&D $ on... Making their devices NOT user serviceable. Louis Rossman would love this. Though it could make him jobless... But he's lucky, people will still continue buying the overpriced unrepairable and unupgradeable Apple bs... Because nothing says earth saving, friday protesting student like Starbucks coffee in a throwaway cup and multiple overpriced throwaway apple products....
The biggest ad on YouTube
Last laptop I bought was an alienware back in 2005... You've got me looking into Framework now. Might actually be worth the money.
me watching this video on my brand new framework
Next time I buy a laptop, it will undoubtedly be a Framework laptop.
Stock options?
Got my framework last week and have been very happy with it
can I design my own case? Can I choose the screen size? Can I choose the OS ?  Could I choose my own CNC case design say the reasonable priced Xaiomi Pro laptop cases which we can use with the framework design ?
Finally, a laptop with the expandability of my 2012 Latitude E6530 in something lightweight, even going beyond my Dell by having a replaceable upgradeable motherboard and ports, and not going through a 97wh battery that goes from 100 to 0 in 15 minutes.
Let say the internal battery is 5 years old and died a horrible death.. can you grab your super nice power bank juice and use it to rescue the laptop including the updating of BIOS? many manufacturers will block it saying you have to use a genuine power batteries for you to flash the BIOS.. that’s why I’m not buying anymore laptop.. they will just ended up in our land fill together with the billions of those AC power brick adapter. I hope Dell and Apple are listening.. ( example is I couldn’t update the BIOS on my m4800 precision and I had to scramble for the correct pin on the brick adapter for the life of me , I don’t understand why Dell had three types of DC barrel connectors on their $100 power adapter) . With Apple and everyone out there , (ASUS, ACER, HP, Sony and Samsung, ‘and’ INTEL,,please, JUST please have one standard just freeking use a USB-C so the connectors are all the same. We just buy a 90W adapter with  PD outpu and use it for all the the type of laptops. No matter what brand it is. You guys are all morons ( LAPTOP MFRS) there are still money to be made for the laptop itself. If we want to accessorize them make all universally compatible to every single one of the PC. Example are SD cards. Laptops has those even a $90 dollar camera can use them too!! I am already infuriated with the direction we are going, junking our environment!!
It would be nice for the laptop have a dedicated gpu
My big thing (only halfway through the video so I don't know if they touched on it but) the packaging is amazing. The amount of products I order or buy off the shelf that wastes so much space. M.2 drives are insanely small yet come in boxes 3 times as wide and 4 times the thickness/depth. Those baby boxes for the interchangeable ports/drives are just great to see.
"My rotator cuff!"
yeah boy..
1 year mark they added 12 gen motherboards
Holy smokin moly balony I am in 1000% in
Question. What is the potential of ordering a new main board with new CPU at a discount compared to a new laptop, and plugging into your 3 year old rig (3 years from now)
This will be my next laptop. If they make a Quadro version I can use for work I'll buy that too. Same for a smartphone and a tablet. I hate throwing tech away.
15:40 Linus tries to inspire a magnetic charger for the laptop
Thanks linux for reminding me to unplug my laptop
I had a Fairphone some years back and it was perfect. Unfortunately was not compatible when I relocated from Europe to Oceania so had to sell it to a buyer in Europe. Framework might be my next laptop once my specced out 2011 Macbook Pro dies.
15:35 TOTALY COOL !!!!
https://youtu.be/0rkTgPt3M4k?t=851
Will the Usb-c stuff work on other OS?
I'm sad that they don't have an expansion card with 2 USB A ports though. Pretty sure a single 3.2 C connection should be able to support 2 USB 2.0 A connectors.
I wish they come up with a 15-inch model. Also after the introduction of USB4, they must launch their AMD variant.
Pointless facemasks.
I'm very excited about this. This has a very high chance of being my next laptop. I have an 00's ThinkPad and the reason I have it is repairability. When that kicks the bucket this is going to be VERY high on my list to consider.
My dad's hp pavilion dv6-1370ev is fully upgradable except gpu and cpu
I love a ton of [stuff/]aspects about the Framework laptops but there's several things that are preventing me from getting them:   The Framework laptops currently-have too few ports. (Only 4 :-(  ).  I need a *minimum* of:  ● 3 USB-3.0 ports  ● 1 dedicated HDMI port (with the most-recent version of HDMI)  ● 1 dedicated DisplayPort port (with the most-recent version of DisplayPort); (thus-far, it doesn't matter-to-me if it's full-size DisplayPort or mini-DisplayPort. I can always use an adapter (ie. mini--to--Full-size DisplayPort cable) if I need DisplayPort; or now that DisplayPort uses a "USB type C"-plug, it'd be even easier to use DisplayPort on a laptop computer).  ● 1 dedicated Gigabit-Ethernet RJ45 network-port  ● 1 DEDICATED full-size SD-memory-card slot  ● *Dedicated* charge port (so you don't waste one of the 4 limited available ports, for charging [the Framework laptop])  ● Externally-accessible removable battery (this would help so you do-not have to open-up the [guts of the] laptop *just* to get at the battery)  ● DEDICATED combo--headphone-microphone 3.5mm port (which the Framework laptop already has, thank-goodness)   If I put in 3 USB-ports, I can only-put USB-C on the fourth port (preferrably the upper-left-hand-corner port, for charging the laptop there), because it uses USB-C to charge the laptop. • (In essence, come to think of it, you only have 3 slots [available to you], because you need a USB-C slot to charge the laptop. Otherwise, you can't charge the laptop. [And when the laptop's-battery runs out, you have a sitting-duck/fancy-paperweight]).  I would have no room to put-in the Ethernet port, or the HDMI port, or the DisplayPort port, because there are only 4 slots, and I need more-slots-than-that to put all-the-stuff-that-I-need on my laptop.  :-(   For these reasons, I cannot currently-get a Framework laptop. (A non--soldered-onto-the-motherboard-processor (ie. [what--in-the-industry--USED-to-be-called] a SOCKETED processor) would *also* be nice).
Not much going on until they make incorporate gpu swapping. Laptops are cheap enough without discrete graphics. I dont see the value
This is the only laptop brand I am ever going to buy from ever egein forever for now on ever until I'm dead then in my will I'm going to have someone take my assets and buy me one more to have in my casket and another to put by my tombstone in case I come back as a zombie.
11:33 Dell 😂😂😂😂
No discrete GPU so I'm good.
You've 100% got me sold on this
not available in NZ yet :(
It's gonna flop
I’m super late to this, but do they plan to use zen? From what I’ve seen now on their website they are on 12th gen Intel, but would they ever support amd? I’m personally an amd person, and it fits my workflow better, but damn, regardless I’m getting one lol, Intel or amd, this is beyond impressive, only criticism is that I wish the usb type c connectors would support 2x ports, considering it seems like it would fit, and setting it up to be recognized as a usb hub shouldn’t be hard, and it then expands the amount of ports which seems to be a premium option nowadays to have more then 4 ports (I understand it charges off the USB port and can’t support it as a hub that way most likely, but at least having that as an optional module would be cool, to allow for more utility
I know I’m pretty late on this, but I’m hoping for a ‘gaming’ edition with a dgpu like a 3070 Ti
15:00 you are telling me a webcam can be that good ? Wtf are other manufacturers doing it's better than every other laptop 😧
4:25 screen looks a tad bent
Why can i find this in google?
Why am I watching a video of a computer that I can't afford to buy for the entire life?
What about the GPU?
Imagine paying Linus to review their laptop and then spending 200K into the company. That's something.
rip if the cpu was using BGA (Ball Grid Array)
this is the polar opposite of apple
14:46 "Yoink" made me laugh, keep the jokes ;)
Upgrade [check] Customisation [pending] ... currently I'm stuck with my Lenovo Thinkpad T460s for its keyboard and touchpad for productivity but the sound quality and graphics are not that good ...  if only the Framework laptops are customisable they would be unstoppable
Don't forget to activate your Windows copy, Linus!! xD
imagine if framework made a better gen of this with the same stuff, but better specs and more upgradable things like the screen for example.
it's a great product, I just worry, as with many of these projects, that their target market is too niche. Like tech heads will love this. But will your general consumer want this? I don't know, my guess is "most" people just want to buy a working product for the lowest price, they don't want to customize it, they don't want to upgrade or repair it, they just want it.  I hope that's not the case but it may be...
Did you say the Intel processor is soldered on the MB?  What about the graphics card? Thx,....would love to have a replaceable graphics card....interesting enough years ago Sony VAIO ( remember them?) they used to have a combo deck (it's a AMD graphics card + Blu ray player + USB + HDMI + VGA that connects up to 3 external monitors)....for their first class Z-series and S-series laptop models which the laptop(s) had its own  intel graphic card. ....
This is getting me hyped. Please revisit framework upgrades in future videos. Would love to hear more about theyr next products.
This is like my dream comes true.. an office laptop killer.. with easy to upgrade feature!!
can you upgrade the gpu too?
apple products are what I call "busy work". useless product just to keep humans busy, they don't actually do anything.
I want a laptop without the battery.  Everyone I know has to carry the charger, so why not get rid of the battery and make more space for actual stuff that will make the laptop better.
could do a ship of theseus exercise with this laptop
Given the fact that this is a new release this looks AWESOME. I think more upgradeability with come with new versions. This is just a decent PC, in laptop form. The fact that other companies haven't done this is just pathetic.
I want to keep hitting the like !
thats amazing
why havent you dont another vid on this? is it because they have gone down hill???
Framework and Fairphone fighting to allow us changeable parts in our devices ❤️ the companies that care
11:52 this is an S tier edit
Power on ac was also in my 7th gen i3 dell vostro  So nothing special but it's great to see that they implemented it  I wish they were shipping in India 🇮🇳 too coz you don't know but if you give Indians option they would like to just make their laptop make work for atleast 15years  So yeah it will actually but beneficial to framework.
Apple fanboy: can I have one without a headphone jack? Framework: no. Apple fanboy: worthless product.
11:53  R.i.p. me! 🤣 I laughed so hard had to watch it again and again! F me, that made my day for some reason
So much praise from you cements this item in the "holy fuck i want to buy it" list
Raise your margins framework!! We want you to survive!!!!!
Linus is the Gordon Ramsey of laptops
this needs to be the future of laptops. I asked various computer shop owners if they could install a 4000 series GPU. Shop owner>>>☹️
I would like Anthony to review this with different linux distros.
Activate windows Linus
Well yeah, but does it have the perfect amount of thermal paste?
a dream computer every nerd wants :)
The concept is awesome! I will definitely look intos this if they start producing 15" - 17" with more (maybe 6) module slots and if they put gpus in it so you can use it for gaming.
This is so important.  I really hope the industry in general work towards a 'Laptop unification' platform that covers Mobos to Graphics cards and disk drives; just like the desktop category. I'm really unsure why this hasn't happened, other than the usual Greed/business reluctance.  It makes so much sense to making Laptops the new desktop.
This is how it's done!
what if the cpu module was "replaceable"  the cpu block of the motherboard would be linked to the rest of it could be via pci and had a different power connection direct to the battery/power adapter
I like my laptops like I like my milkshakes  Very thick  I want it to have 7 USB ports, hdmi, batteries that last a month on a full charge and be able to have a built in proper normal sized keyboard instead of cutting out the number pad (which is more useful then they thought due to Unicode)  I will pay extra if It is 3 inches thick  But still that is so good when it comes to laptops especially when the other companies are glueing, hiding the specs, generally being greedy
I still wonder when this can be available to the mass consumer
I want a 12th gen one of these so bad but I just can't morally justify the cost at this time considering I can get a 12700h with a 3070 for a bit cheaper. I know they're are for a totally different user and I would be willing to accept that but given the poor battery life of the framework it hard to again justify it against other opter like a Dell xps 13. I would also really love to see a model come with a few extra ports like a basic USB A and or C integrated amd then have the 4 expansion alots the little I O is a hard pill to swallow
Imagine all techy companies just get together and make consumer friendly upgradable devices, like upgradable phones, laptops, softs, etc
I'm gonna be recommending these, absolutely amazing.
I love this. Although, I'll be honest, I'd prefer chunky. I want a laptop that's big, bulky, and tough enough to drop down a flight of stairs. I mean, I'm going to keep an eye on them, and when I have the money to switch back to a laptop from the new desktop I recently got I'll probably go for them, but we'll see.
I hope they do a 17"+ modular gaming laptop with all the bells and whistles.
Wow they had me crying only 4 min into the video. This company and product is a gift from God and I hope the company is a smashing success. I too will product get one the moment I need a new laptop.
This is so fucking cool
I have always been thinking about hardware switches in the past , so cool to finally see it
I love how, at the moment, there's 256K likes (2022-07-08). That's all you'll ever need, don'tcha know!
this is my dream pc right there, everything can be interchangeable, FUCK YOU APPLE!
Congrats on 2^8 thousand likes, Linus :D
This is like that phone that you could change except it's a real thing
“Well that’s awesome, It’s so compact!” That’s what she said
reminds me of the modular Google phone that died before it was marketed
Wow, this looks great. Keeps kids and ppl interested in building and understanding devices. Does upgrading components drive down the price of components, or is the industry changing too fast that it's more profitable to sell a shiny black box? Perhaps supply chain shortages will revamp interest in getting individual components instead of waiting for a whole laptop. Having x86 and ARM/RISC options sounds interesting. Hope they succeed.
this is awesome i just wish they had better gpu options other than iris xe graphics lol
Wish I had known about these buys before I bought a new laptop 2 months ago because my last laptop was 10 years old.
you had me at replaceable battery. Can't wait to rock this with a fairphone. more companies like this please!
im pretty sure u guys can make that magnetic hacky thing. DO IT!
Is this PS1?
Can we invest?
POV Apple: they gonna lose profit from colouring those screws and cabels for only an extra cent
11:52 I was trying to sleep but once I heard this there was no chance of rest.
Also this laptop would greatly benefit from amd 6000 series chipsets with integrated rdna2 graphics and the power savings of the amd chip
I would LOVE to see a thin and light gaming and productivity laptop from framework in 14 and 16 inch 16:10 aspect ratio. It would be a massive hit if done and implemented properly
UPDATE: Framework offers motherboard upgrades!!!
I adore the concept of modular laptops & phones, however I kinda cringe when I see them on the market nowadays. They tend to be made by start ups that have a huge marketing campaign, but nothing in the way of sustainable investors. Also, bc it's an enthusiast device, there's no agreed upon standardization - everything is proprietary. This means their method of modularity is limited to the modules the start up sells, & a lot of the time replacement modules aren't easy to come across. Consider Fairphone (the only modular device company I'm aware of that's stuck around) - they're currently on gen 4, & while I can't speak for the 4th gen, I can confirm gens 1 & 2 we're a nightmare bc when they jumped to 2 none of the modules for 1 were compatible & the company was having difficulty (or more accurately, they stopped caring ) in getting the gen 1 parts produced. So, if your charger port for you phone was out, you should just buy a new phone.
Please make it 2in1 !!!!
I love this
Perfect thing to install Arch Linux on. Fight me.
Laptop CPUs were once replacable, meaning that you could swap it for a better model if desired. But those were usually PGA and not BGA. Some manufacturers made it really easy, others essentially required the complete disassembly of the laptop.  It's technically possible, so my guess is that Framework simply can't offer that feature because no laptop CPUs with pins are being produced anymore.
Brains and hearts into a laptop
I Love This, I Am Going To Get This
if they come out with a 17 inch, then im considering buying
I Can't wait till they Come to Australia
Your excitement for this is completely contagious.
AUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH
I would love this for IT or CS I would try and make it for Mac 2 boot system. And would have that book as a high security tool to be adaptable. But low security risk. It's great
Time to buy one... Just to support this
Let's hope this company takes off!
I prefer if the laptop was intuitive when upgrading or repairing components where you don’t even need to think to change something.
please let all laptops in future be like this !!  its so useful !!  just imagine buying a laptop every 2 years because one component isn't up-to-date anymore....
Why is there not enough capital in this company to have anything in stock ? Why are we waiting months for these to ship.
Try switching out a buggy Keyboard on a HP.
god the fact that this product exists makes me so happy
ACTIVATE WINDOWS
That’s just awesome
linus can see the value in this
I like the review and concept behind the framework laptop. Can you do a review on how this laptop handles video editing as well as other tasks, as I’m looking for a new laptop?
Back to watch this again. If only there was a model that had a better graphics option, I'd be all over it. Hell, maybe I'll get one just as a spare laptop or a work laptop if I need one.
I remember having an old af laptop that you could upgrade the CPU on I miss it very much
11:54 me when I get home
So seriously, no one has an answer to what happened at 11:54?
man I still really want a Framework laptop with a dedicated GPU. If they added that I'd buy one within seconds tbh.
« That is not an unreasonable amount of flex »  I dunno linus, it sounds to me as if Framework just flexed on the entire PC industry by doing something repairable and modern
If this company would collaborate with Apple ooof that would be amazing.
They’ve actually started releasing motherboard replacement kits which is super awesome
But can I plug in an external GPU?
We gonna get a followup vid on this?
11:45 dell ahem ahem
The product seems great, but just a small thing to keep in mind before buying this Linus is an investor in Frameworks. Now I don't know much about tech certainly not as much as he knows, but as an investor in a company he might let a few things slide about the product if you know what I mean. Im not saying its a bad product or anything it seems great and I'm considering buying one in the future but this video just seems like a prolonged AD for Framework.
Masks make even Canadians look like a jack a s s
Others: buys a laptop, uses it This dude here: buys a laptop, immediately opens it up
Some of their options on their website are also AMAZING. Their expansion cards are affordable and useful. They have everything you need to upgrade it, at decent prices. They even have some customization options like different keyboards, different color bezels, *even different weight hinges*.
legos
I need one of these
inspiron n5050 you can actually replace the cpu, it isn't soldered, it's an odd socket though
Yoooo this laptop is from the future
That is sooo cool. Now if they just upgrade the motherboard so i can get the power i want out of the cpu and gpu. Personally my laptop has a ryzen 9 5900hx and a rtx 3080 with 16gb vram
Sooo hyped to see new (well actually old!) models of making our tech done so well. Thanks for bringing light to it, and here's hoping we start seeing our stuff as more upgradable and less disposable!
Dude this thing is so popular their keyboards are out of stock that’s crazy
i am anti-wired mouse. i only use wireless logitechs.
Amazing!!! How about working with linux?
Man, I hate that good reviews and stuff like this make me feel so bitter. That's all I've experienced in adulthood, is we have so many issues that could be fixed but nobody does it. I love this laptop and hate so many others now, and I'm not even a laptop guy
I respect Framework's high effort in putting a laptop that no other company laptop makers include as upgradeable/repairable laptop, Framework is the best for it, Give Respect Gamers and pc builders.
Very useful to have modules. One of which is wasted for the charging port. What the fuck were they thinking?
10/10
I use a wired mouse too many. In my mind, wireless connections MUST be losing more data in the air compared to a good quality cable. I know that a wireless mouse is capable of 1 ms latency that would be inperceptible, and even pros use them because there's 0 chance of their cable getting snagged, but it just feels like there's something about a wireless mouse I can't trust.
I like the idea but it does look a little worse than a MacBook idk why they can't be like the early unibodies
By now, 12th gen upgrade kits are available. Top notch support.
Sadly, It doesn't ship to my country
I’m supporting that company 100%
8:45 not all laptop cpu's are soldered to the board, I recently took apart an old laptop andit had a socket for the cpu and you just had to turn a little screw 90 degrees and then you could take the cpu right out, it was a pretty old laptop though, I think it was from 2010 (it was broken and couldn't be repaired btw, im not a monster)
i have 3060 laptop 14:01
My next laptop order, guaranteed
im guessing, this is not for gaming, digital artists.....which are the guys who would actually appreciate this kind of genius....i nice follow-up video of a test run would be nice.
they now have swappable motherboards that way the laptop can be upgraded to 12th gen
should have made a usb c mandatory since you need it anyways for charging. that way it doesn’t waste one of the expansion slots on it
This is just what the world needs so bad. I just need thunderbolt on this and my money is yours!
They'll definitely be my #1 choice for my next laptop
for a tech company having Linus live on video ordering the product they sent him to check out is the best advertising u could ever ask for
im selling mine for this one
The battery disconnect option in the bios is seriously cool and soooooo useful. WHY ISNT THIS IN EVERY LAPTOP
I've been looking at these and Purism laptops because the platforms support Free SW.
Is GPU upgradeable?
just slap in a typewriter keyboard
Well, to be honest, unavailability of upgrading CPU and GPU breaks the concept a lot, more work should be done in that direction.
"Why dont Apple, Lenovo, Others do this ? " - Apple spends money NOT to be able to upgrade and repair.
Need a 15” and 17” size option.  But yes, this is good to see the industry heading in this direction.
16:10 stop testing the thermals on a mouse pad, you are choking the air vent intake
9:54
there was a project modular phone but it was discontinued. the project ara
1:38 Linus was about to become one of their sponsors
So guys do you know whats crazy? I cant spent 2000€ for this awesome machine right know, but its modular with spare parts so I wonder if its possible if I buy part by part, month by month 🤔 so I could split the bills over the year. That would be awesome!
sad that they dont deliver to my country, although thats to be expected from any smallish company and a small country even amazon's nearest division is germany though they do deliver here
can you remove the camera and mic and run without it? I like the hardware switch but I personally would rather just physically removing them if possible
@10:00 like i said in other post what you are missing is 2:1/360 degree screen and high performance. I really want a good laptop that offers top intel CPU and x050/x060 GPU. The HP Spector 360x is basically the only laptop that fits the bill. If this had those high performance parts with a foldable screen so you could tent it/tablet/fold it so it fit nicely on a plan or use external keyboard. This would be an instant buy for me.  They could actually offer a socketed CPU but would add significant amount of thickness but I am not advocating that lol  They should though offer an 80 watt hour battery. HP Spector 360 has that and is a better size and worth the minimal extra weight
You add a 360 degree hinge and make a high performance model with a 360 degree hinge and you got me sold! All I want is a high performance foldable laptop like the HP spector 360 but make that upgradable and you got not just my money but all my future sales!
maybe im wrong but a dbrand deal for different looks seems like it would be a no brainer and super easy for this laptop
I would love one of these but damn prob can’t afford it
I watched your video saved up and bought it
no airport card slot no pci express slot no way expand GPU.
How much upgradability do you want  Desktop manufacturers: yes Framework: yes Other laptop manufacturers: No
Doesn't anybody make non-gloss screens for laptops & monitors anymore? They've all moved to annoying glossy screens just so they look cooler when turned off. We're dang tired of looking at a reflection of ourselves & the room whenever we're in a normally lit room, near a bright window, or outside. Most of us real computer users don't need a touch screen (they're for phone people). These glossy screens are a huge deal breaker for watching videos, movies, playing games, or intense reading. One has to set the brightness painfully bright & shorten battery life to just barely outshine our reflection.
I would love to see a bigger, thicker model with a DVD drive, I refuse to believe that DVD's are obsolete! =D Also if they make a model similar to the classic thinkpads, I think a lot of people would love it!
When is the upgrade video coming out?
Here Iam watching this on my galaxy book pro 360 which doesnt even let you put n a full sized nvme ssd :)
upgradable laptop  puhlease  there is only one king of that hill  Eurocom
I really don't mind a larger laptop if it has the performance. They could make different sizes and probably have a market for all of them.
Good!
i swore to never buy another laptop like 5 years ago. you just changed my mind. high hopes they have a touch screen by now.
Huh ?!??!???!!!??!? 900bucks !?!??!!!?                          Sorry, I was buying one
Love this !
I kinda want one now...
“Wheres my type a” sounds like an angry question directed towards apple without context
we just need a ryzen configuration to show up
I would only buy one if the GPU is swappable. That is the largest bottleneck for a mid-range gamer.
11:35 im watching this on a shitty dell computer
Well, I am getting this laptop for my computer systems tech program for college, going DIY because I need the 64gb of ram so I can flex.
oh my god, i could climax.
Ok. That guy’s girlfriend dumped him right???
this is soo sickkk!!! currently in the market for a laptop so as soon as im able to im likely grabbing one of these
what about dedicated graphics?
So question, does it come with a video card for gaming?
2:30 wowie five mine only needs 4 and mine is as thin as that
latest laptop:"finally i am upgradable." PC:"wtf do you think I was for!!!!"
Unpopular opinion - while upgradability is good and all, Most people are not going pay 2k for an igpu laptop
More stuff needs to be made this way
they solder the cpu and gpu. not even all apple computers solder those.
8:50 The fact that when this thing eventually becomes obsolete, you could just easily take out the motherboard and repurpose it for some other project is briliant
I wonder if you could have Linux on it... I can't imagine the compatibility troubles
I love the first fifteen seconds, especially since I've successfully repaired several of the Touch Bar MacBook Pros with my "idiot hands."
Now imma make a phone like this.
Engineers from htc should hang there head in shame!
What’s so great is that even if people don’t know or don’t want to open up the laptop they can take it to a repair shop that will have no problem fixing/upgrading this laptop
Hi. Where can I buy framework laptop?
Got a framework myself too. It broke shortly after getting it, but it was easy to fix and I love it. Thanks for covering this laptop and company.
Anybody remember phonebloks/ project Ara? Pepperidge Farms remembers.
this laptop makes me very happy.   why are those modules so big tho?
It will be thrown in the trash eventually.
Hey
Please please please have them make a 2 in 1
This reminds me of that phone from a while back that was gonna be modular. I can't remember the project name but I think it was Motorola maybe but then Google took them over  Edit: Project Ara. Looked amazing back in like 2015/16 when it was around
If they really want this to take off they need to make a gaming laptop that has a swappable gpu
we need something like micro center in canada...i have to do an hour drive for anything electronics...we only have a best buy nearby....i once tried to ask them for a mosfet, the guy had a panic attack.
can you draw on that type of track pads ??
I went to look at it and I was like nope can’t afford that.
When my current Nitro 5 laptop dies on me this is where I'm gonna turn myself to for a new laptop.
I'm still waiting for it to ship to Denmark
Love how you show the Fairphone website right during that intro line. :P
11:53 Linus is a tyrannosaurus confirmed 👍
Framework be in the comments like: write that down! Write all of these down!  ✍️
Framework are now the new IKEA for laptop lol
16:20 that is something so many laptops don't have that they should have...
11:53 when i heard the beep it sounds JUST like my bios beep so i legit peed pant for a sec thinking that my pc just died :D
Its not because they "dont trust" their users. almost EVERY company that makes functional products like electronics, appliances, automobiles progressively implements ways to make repairs more and more difficult many times to the point of not letting anyone do it like apple famously did, but also designing them in ways that make them fail, and adding things that make the parts non modular or inaccessible, etc. Some time before the 21st century refrigerators were made with their compressors and coolant in an easily accesible corner that was simply hidden by a metal panel you just unscrewed for the sake of aesthetics. Well at some point the completely close that compartment; literally surround the ONLY actively functional parts in a steel box that you would risk busting the compressor and dying from the shockwave or puncturing the freon reservoir, or electrocute yourself. So now instead of spending $50 to have a technician come and repair it in about 10mins guaranteed no matter what could possibly be wrong with it  cause theres only so much that could, now you HAVE to pay to have your old one lugged away and disposed properly and spend several hundred dollars on the cheapest of non used fridges. Thats why they do it linus. Because how are they supposed to make their target %6 growth every year until the end of time if youre just being selfish and saving money keeping a perfectly functional and repairable one. Thats why they do it. Thats why theres only two types of technician now. COMPUTER ELECTRONICS, and auto-repair/maintenance. All the money that was driving that entire career path that was ALOT easier for poor to middle class to get an infinitely cheaper education than university and to get a government certification in a career that broke its back along with so many holding up the middle class, and the opportunity for even mediocre success provided to us against the weight of the INFINITE GREED of the ultra wealthy that KNOW their oligarchic practices making our mixed ideology economy as close to la ze faire ad the can not only will not work but CANT work if youre already raping the land and poisoning the people that call it home to extract even more finite resources than we as a species already have. If we dont go extinct by causing the planet to become uninhabitable via triggering 5,000 years of global nuclear winter or ignore the land hurricanes (derecho) we've had IN THE WINTER in the midwest last year when the 2 yeads before that know even knew what a derecho was; then the earth will be little more than a pebble after we've mined it all away to mega cities in mars. Mars would be perfect to cover half the planet in concrete and pollute it so bad the atmosphere is remade from our exhaust because you couldnt walk around there with total environment isolation suit complete with the masks of the future anyway (space suit).
Bro got 2 sponsors in 1 video
AND NOW INSTALL MACOS ON IT
Did I hear wattercooled Framework laptop?
The moment they become even remotely successful, there will be chinese clones of every module on Aliexpress and that will hit their "people will come back to us for upgrades" bottom line.
dude made me excited like he is about the computer, it looks so rad
Quite cool indeed. I'm definitely going to check them out. 6:25 Well, let's hope it didn't significantly "impact" performance, as that would cause a lot of damage. You mean it significantly _affected_ performance.
Absolute Apple Troll LOL
im gonna buy this one as soon as possible, just for the extra screws
I'm sorry, but where does the $300 of savings from self-assembly instead of pre-assembled figure come from? The laptop in DIY configuration STARTS at $749, and that is before you even add the wi-fi card, storage, ram, power adapter and ports to the configuration, so the starting price is incredibly misleading, unless you want a laptop with a CPU, battery, screen and keyboard, and nothing else. After all of the lowest cost options for a fully functional laptop are added (power adapter included) the price ends up being $1,021, which is more than a pre-assembled one at $1000 for the cheapest model (can be cheaper if you don't need certain ports). What gives? What is the point of the DIY option if it ends up being more expensive to assemble a laptop yourself?
This Laptop is freaking awesome. Next time I buy one I will look at their page first.
I ABSOLUTELY F'ING LOVE IIIIIIIIIIIT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Okay that looks like the laptop I need
s/o Denso-san for their development of QR codes
I would love to have one... But erm soo pricey.... To self, start with a screen 🤣
This thing is literally a modern version of IBM Thinkpad 755CD
Let's talk about how the CMOS battery dies and the laptop can't start.
What about gaming on it?
7:53 that reaction was superbbb
for some reason i thought they shut down but i just checked and they're still going strong!!
If I had the money I'd buy one to support the practice. That genuinely looks so good.
Luv it Luv it Luv it, only thing you didn't mention is the Green aspect of this device. That could be a major game changer by itself.
I love this, we always need this
i hope they deliver to Aussie land super stocked if they do😀
I've been dreaming of this for years! Standardized , upgradeable chassis systems for laptops could make desktops largely obsolete for the average person.
I want them to win 🏆
The modular I/O ports are such a great idea. Everyone uses their laptop differently and they will be able to customise it to fit their exact needs.
I just saw this, and I am in love with this product, it is simply amazing how this company was so unknown to me until today that I'm even ashamed to call myself a PC enthusiast.
Damn I really wish I saw this video before buying a laptop for college, granted I trust my abilities to fix my laptop that’s why I didn’t get a warranty but this woulda make me feel so much better
if they bring out a rev 2 i hope they incude screws instead of magnets as I (and i assusme many others) will sit playing with the thing taking it apart and then ruining the snugness of the things, once ive saved up im probably going for this of the hp envy x360  wishlist would be a touch & privacy display , camera privacy shutter (or option to bin the camera altogether) and a black chassis gaming model would be nice along with a amd line of processors
he could even buy 10 of those even after dropping that one that he's reviewing due to too much animated unboxing. lol
Legos for adult
it is company like this that will kill apple and I really want to help them do it. Its companies like Apple that will destroy the planet but making products that need to be replaced every 6 months
One thing Ive noticed is that the clear keyboard they include doesnt have any lettering on it. Thats really cool and I love clear, its my favorite "color" but as someone who while yes can type without looking, I dont always remember where say the % sign is or the F10 key, Id like to see some white or black coloring to see what key is being pressed a bit easier
Happy Linus noises are the best.
Just bought one for school.  It's the only laptop I've found that doesn't come with an OS, so I can just put Linux on there off the bat. Super excited to try it out.
I've always hated laptops for the exact reason that if something fails or the battery starts going to bad Im stuck having to get a new one, but this, I can get on board with this
This is failed idea at it's core.even desktops are rarely upgraded and it's far worse for mobile technology,no one want to invest 500$ in used scratched laptop when he can buy new one for 1000$.by the time u want to upgrade something, x other things would need to be replaced to work with upgrade,ether from old technology or just for being used...
Yes plz!
Hi Linus!!! a Long term review would be nice for this laptotp as sometimes modularity doesn't mean longevity  thank's again for the heads up definitely keeping their website on my favourite!!
i want a track point.
Its like a lego but computer 🥺🥺  Plus linux os 😘 Master Peace
14:30 - the "next" in driver installers is about signal of intent, and the ability to back out instead of accidentally installing the wrong driver that temporarily removes functionality (instead of the tedious process of booting into safemode, removing the driver, and restarting the device to install the new one again). that's a necessary evil, given how many companies throw every single driver for multiple products on one page and the ambiguity of those drivers being compatible.  framework has a massive advantage by only having one SKU of motherboard/laptop, so only having one current set of drivers for their current vendors of i/o prevents confusion, but once they start sourcing parts from other companies or producing more SKUs, an unattended driver installer might become a bane more than a boon.
I'll keep them in mind for my next laptop
Man.... now im sad that i couldent buy one of em for me. Duno if they have a high end gaming laptop. If they did then im realy sad, if not then i would take XMG ultra anyways.
Now if they would just offer an option to use coreboot firmware and ship without an OS! Free hardware and software at last
Who is this for though? Apple fanboys are like 80% of the laptop market and the other 20% are gamers on laptops so?!!!!
Upgradeable ports........as long as you use our own propriety devices!!
What you can say about this laptop after almost a year? Are you using it? And how Framework doing? Please respond to this one, I beg you.  I've tried to ask you at livesteams but I can't use superchat in my region or use the link with merch😞
Right to repair should include the Right to modify freely (at least after warranty has expired) Once my laptop has gone beyond its warranty there should be no possible way for apple or whomever to interfere in my ability to repair or upgrade my device assuming i have the skill and tools to do so.  Glad to hear that at least one computer company gets this too, and if i ever need to replace my laptop i'm definitely looking Framework's way.  (Edit: The only bad thing i'm seeing so far is that there's no options when it comes to graphics cards.  This likely stems from the fact they only have one computer model available so far and its only available in the slimmer format that wouldn't permit a graphics card for one reason or another.)
I love this. Modules! In a computer! And you can mix and match! Someone's finally funding this!
"It's affordable!" Me: "It's $1,200 for a pretty basic config."  I can bring that down to $1,100 for the most absolute basic for a Windows laptop (obviously, if you're going Linux, you can knock $150 off the price), but it's still $400-500 more than other laptops with the same specs _and larger screens._  And that, boys and girls, is the #1 driving factor in the move away from modular laptop design. It sucks, but adding modularity increases costs considerably.
A laptop that will go the distance and totally  reparable about time🥳 Freaking awesome
I move in a week and just realized I need a laptop. Dug around for my old one and it hadn't been turned on since 2009. Keeps giving me popups to upgrade to Windows 7. I'd get a framework but it will probably arrive after I've left. I really, really, really wish I had thought of this a few weeks back so I could order a framework and support the team involved in it.
I want to buy one of these
Found out about the framework Laptop though "The Gadget Show" and seriously looking over this Video, there is so much it can offer.. though I heard you say touchscreen.. what about 360 angle as well and as for the expansion ports, do you think they could easily add another two either side to make it 4 instead of 2.. or in another model shrink the ports to have 8 ports on each side?... that could have ENDLESS possibilities.. love love love this!!
I watched this again after videos of Apple product repair.  I love the fact that their team consists ex-Apple engineers.  I am in the market for a new laptop and this is top of the list.  I stretch the life of my computers well beyond what is expected or reasonable, so nice to upgrade a little more often than a decade for a laptop. I am of the 0.0001% of the population that uses the TrackPoint, my IT department was shocked with my request for a replacement cap.  Would love to this as an option on a keyboard, as they are vanishing from most on the market I have seen.
10 seconds in to this video all I can think is "don't underestimate me you lanky looking prick"
I honestly just hope that they progressively make new components instead of making one batch of upgrades for the model and then abandoning it and making a completely different model. *cough, cough* Fairphone... I had so much faith in that company and talked it up so much just to be let down. fingers crossed frameworks is diff. Here's rooting for the underdog.
they shouldn't call it usb "type anything" since it's not universal
It seems like these only come in a 13.5" size.  I prefer my screen to be 17.5"
having now got a framework laptop  i have to say even though i got the preassembled version (ironically the config  i wanted was cheaper that way by about £30) i'm really enjoying this laptop so far. the build quality feels premuim and well done and its 13.5 inch screen is the perfect middle ground for a student like myself who needs portability as well as performance. side note: having held the expansion cards in my hand i was surprised at how small they were and how big they  look in linuses hand as compared to mine.
64 gigs of memory. Crap. I just built a new desktop with that amount. What the hell are people running on their laptops these days.
Still can not get in OZ :(
#Red-Linus
i would like to see a update video on how they developed over the last 9 months
Not only does a modular design enable the end user consumers to customise the PC to their specifications & free themselves from the self imposed shackles of tech companies, it’s more sustainable! Instead of having to buy a new unit after a few years when the components become outdated or break & spend tonnes of money, you can just upgrade the components, which also reduces e-waste! Of course the big tech companies hate this because their profit margins would shrink if people weren’t basically forced to continually buy new products, but the freedom of choice of us end users & greater sustainability is far more important
Framework is the ideal capitalist business, very epic
While the QR codes are a good idea, a paper manual would be best 10 years down the line just in case there site is down.
Do they ship to Turkey and do they have more options to The keyboard with different language alphabet and can we have a numpad? Would also be happy if they made compatibility for Ryzen CPUs aswell :) my mind is right now full of questions and stuff but i guess this much is enough for now 😁
I wanna hit that point in my life where I'm excited about a free screwdriver
I wish i can buy that but Its $999
great idea, but it's 13" only.  15" & 17" screens would leave a lot more room for customization.
do you have all that stuff in the box when you buy it or do you have to buy it  sepertly.
The one thing I don't like is the touch pad. I hate them in general and especially the fact that I can't get one without it. And with this latest version of windows I can't even turn it completely off.
I found this video around 6 months ago.  Today, I got the shipping confirmation E-Mail after having bought it the second it came out in my country. I am INCREDIBLY hyped for it's arrival!
That is the best sales pitch for a laptop I've ever seen.  Literally, I would buy one NOW.
One thing I hope for that fully consumer friendly PC Razer is gonna make…. I hope the thunderbolt ports are really fast, or they use two as a standard for each module
Just bought mine!
Ok, screw getting a new MacBook. I’m getting this instead
Im getting mine as soon as it has touch and supports a pen.
but can it play games!?
anyone know how the company is doing?
At 7:22 Linus said port 2 times
"Laptop's nowday are little use until something go wrong and then just toss it away to the garbage"  My 2010 Vaio: *p a t h e t i c*
I'm totally going to start saving up to buy one. I bought an Origin brand laptop before they sold to corsair, and I've LOVED it. Its also 100% customizable, more so IMO than this laptop, but mine is a discontinued one, what was their EON 17-SLX. Its a 17" MONSTER and weighs like 20 lbs with 2 charging cables. it's excellent for everything, but is NOT travel friendly. to have a upgradable, repairable, light, thin, and easily usable laptop like this would be absolutely incredible. I HATE buying a new computer every couple years, it's an ICNREDIBLE waste of components.
That’s awesome, hopefully this succeeds  and doesn’t flop I’d 100% get one.
I've got one of these.  It's a fantastic laptop, works OOTB with Linux, and the fact that I can get upgrades for an already awesome lappie going forward is amazing.  Incidentally, it _does_ have intrusion detection, but as the first user, I have full control of it.  Also, my first support purchase after buying it was a second power brick - it also charges my phone super-fast, and getting a good high-wattage USB-C charger is hard.
That is something I would definitely buy. They did a great job!
Apple didn't want to make a computer like this cause they know thier customers will just buy another one, meaning they want money.
Works with Linux ?
can it run KSP? I think it can't but maybe it can do 4k part craft
I'm definitely striving to get this laptop! Even if it isn't the beefiest laptop ever, the DIY project will certainly be very fun
meanwhile apple mac books every release new charger Lmao
8:41 that's not entirely true.intel sells laptop cpus with pads on the bottom.
Although that's nice... Activate windows bitchhhhhhhhhhhh
AMD CPU option?
This with Thunderbolt Expansion on one side would be the perfect laptop. USB for peripherals Thunderbolt for PCIE Expansion.
I feel like they are insulting Apple and that make me sad. 😢
last time i checked G-Skillz bought the sponsor not the other way round
A good graphics card in there would be nice lol.
My Nerd/Geeky side is freaking out
Aviation grade, respect!
2:19
Smoothest Segway I have ever seen
i havent seen linus This excited about a piece of tech in a long time
The computer is aimed at "everyone else"
what if you can't scan the qr codes?
what about gaming performance? ik im nearly a year late to this lol
I don't understand a single thing you say but watching you makes people think I'm smart
I will buy a Framework when my Gateway P7805u FX laptop with the 1920x1200 HD display dies. I bought in 2009 still and it still works great. Although the 13 year old battery only holds a 40 minute charge. I was surprisingly able to upgrade the cpu to a T9900 and the Ram to 8 gigs of DDR3. This is a desktop replacement tank of a laptop. That just will not quit. Even the original charge brick is still going strong.
We need more of this in other brands
Companies and schools should really start partnering. It would save them so much money if they could repair them in house.
Literally a User Friendly laptop.
I give this 2 more years. At best.
I have a lenovo S730 and i can see where some of it came from
incidentally geekster, it wasn't that long ago that CPUs WERE replaceable in laptops and memory and harddrives ARE generally replaceable unless you go with a chromebook or a pile of sh*t (*manufactured by actual, literal chinese slaves-) "high end" crApple.
I received my framework laptop some weeks ago. (I'm french) I was expecting a good device, but I am pleasantly surprised, it is more powerfull that expected. I have got a desktop pc with a good CPU and GPU for 3 or 4 years. In the CPU intensive tasks, like video editing and such, the framework is better and quicker at exporting those videos. Obviously the framework gets hotter (85°c approx.) and my desktop pc doesn’t overcome 60°c with a noctua air cooler. The lack of GPU makes it less performing in games and real time 3d work, but not as much as I thought. Even in big games, if I drop down the resolution and set the graphic parameters as « low » it work quite well. The screen, keyboard and trackpad are really great, the sound is OK not super powerfull but good. I have a macbook pro for my work and I have ever found the keyboard to be annoying to use. The trackpad is also quite « sticky », fingers don’t slide easily on the surface, the framework is way more enjoyable to use for me. The small form factor is so cool, even more with this tiny power supply. I think that it is a great device, with evolution and personalisation in mind at is core, and I hope that framework will continue on the long run, I am really happy to have get one !
im happy these companies finally did a colab, i love this laptop
what are the Passmark results for t he different options? Great video.
Apple would never do this
you can't choose the graphics card but can you change it yourself?
If there were a touchscreen display option, I'd probably insta-buy. It's kind of expensive considering a touch screen Dell XPS 13 is about the same price with similar specs as their base model. 2-in-1 capability would be nice too.
He says in the video that you'll save $300 by building it yourself, but it looks like it's actually more expensive to get the DIY with the same specs as any of the pre-builts. Like, what?
I can't believe I can have a small footprint laptop motherboard that can be run outside the original case and it's not a 2 core relic. Tons of projects are possible just with this
check this out Linus:  https://youtu.be/y8jiYl0CzKc
1:37 I wonder, does LTT have Linus insurance?
Overpriced.
YouTube autoplay and Linus having a screaming intro are not a very good combo in a silent room.  Especially when you are distracted by something. 😆
Bought mine today for school thanks to Linus' review! This company and how they're trying to do this warms my heart and I wanna see them succeed!
I cried when I saw this...   Because I can't buy one in Australia :((((
This is the world we need.. but not the one we're getting. Imagine how much plastic waste would be saved if everyone thought like this. Let's be real.. that will never happen because $$$.. but this company is the absolute MVP of... everyone, as far as I'm concerned.
Still no insensitive business wise for apple to make their laptops repairable or upgradable
16:52 that joke literally wrote itself.
2:19 he is so happy
This looks really good, but I wish thy will start selling in the UK...
I bought an Asus Zenbook recently but if I,d of known about this product I most likely wouldn't of
11:52 jesus, god Linus your killing me....
I was wondering whether or not I could theoretically hook up a Desktop 500w power supply and a Desktop Graphics Card
You  brought up Steam libraries, but there's no graphics card so why would you need the expansion thing?
I like the camera shutter and microphone switch
16:27 wow, battery disconnect. yeah, i keep my lappy plugged in all day as well. but thanks god asus has included "battery charging control" software in it - so, i keep it barred at 60% or 80% charging.
Its a great execution of a good idea. I f i want upgradability and io options i would obviously go for a desktop
i really am hopeful to see the future of modular laptops
WTF a portable computer with full modificate ???!!! OMG I don't understand if you can change de CPU and GPU ?
The part where he reacted to the keyboard was frightening
ok so current laptops are like school now, and framework is like what students actually need.
How would it handle to M play games? What all could it run graphic wise?.  Laggy or over heat?
nice
12:00 has me dying
Tell MicroCenter they need to open stores in Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin!!! :)
audiophiles are gonna put something stupid where that speaker is  you already know it
"Dodaddamagigs" should be in Webster's Dictionary, dang-nabbit!
Awesome but what about GPU options?
They got ports for your ports
I honestly hope they will release a model with the new ryzen 6000. And a larger model with a discrete gpu, and maybe even have the option of 2.5in drives.
Did i miss the gpu?
My favorite LTT video
This is the coolest laptop I've ever seen and I only learned about it today
This is really cool but it only really excels in allowing for easy repairs. It could be a great product if they also looked at the accessibility standpoint like having a braille or raised keyboard, or being able to swap out the keyboard entirely for an adaptive game controller. Bluetooth and NFC/RFID reader/writer expansion cards. Something similar to a touch bar on a Macbook. It's a cool concept but it just seems like it's too early to buy.
Needs an ethernet expansion card
My next phone will be modular. My next laptop too. I HATE having to throw out phones every 2 years just because they start failing
still no swapable cpu and gpu     : (
Very cool, I remember when Google had an idea for a similar product, but it was a phone, it was interesting because you could change pretty much everything, battery, screen, microphones, cameras, whatever you wanted. The project got cancelled. Obviously.
This just feels like a twenty min ad. Moving on.
Great idea the upgradable laptop. It's on my list of where to buy the next one before I head to Dell.   Oh, and not all of us are US based. So offering free headsets kinda stink when it's US based only. :(
Not sure what the deal is with some companies making hard to upgrade / repair.   HP (Elitebok range) and Lenovo Carbon and T Series are all easy to get the back off and upgrade RAM or SSD's. Maybe Apple and Microsoft should learn from them.  The HP's are quite attractive, admittedly the Lenovos are a bit ugly.
What if they made this to where u could litterly just press down on anything on the bottom and pop it out and put a new part in there as a replacement  Litterly this but this is 1 and that is 10
"performant"
errrrrrrr... just memory, processor em graphic card upgradeable, would by nice... but these modules sounds dumb... idk...
He's like a kid on Christmas
I don’t need or want a laptop but I almost want to buy one anyway just to support the proliferation of products like this. 👍🏻
dont think ive ever seen him this happy before
I realy want to invest in stocks now
Okay stupid question maybe - why do you want your laptop to have a touchscreen? What are you tapping on?
11:52
36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them.
have you ever looked at a lenovo thinkpad? I have 2 of the 400 series, socketed(and upgradable) CPU, 2 memory slots, a few PCI slots for WiFi and stuff, one can be used for LTE or an SSD the DVD drive can be replaced by a HDD case, or you can slot in an extra battery(one of 3 available battery pack locations) got all sorts of ports on the laptop, and once you put it in a dock you can run 3 monitors with DVI, VGA or HDMI, get 10 USB ports and whatever  for 200$ you can pick one up in good condition, with dock and 2 power supplies, parts are still available
Kinda wanna see a complete teardown just for fun.
Framework deserves to go to the moon. Take off Framework, take off
Planned obsolescence is the name of the game
man, can't i wait till i can just go to a library wait tiil some dude with a laptop goes to the toilet and steal a processor
999$ CAD starting price it is not bad at all for what it can do and it seems to go well bc they now ship within a week
Wish I didnt buy a macbook now
Not as thin as a MacBook tho
Can I connect an external GPU? Cuz that would be insane if you could
linus whats up with that cracked phone you can afford millions of dollars in upgrades for pcs and not a phone case dissapointed
Profit margins non existent
This laptop is for suckers. I bet the parts break down frequently so the company gets to charge you parts forever. It can't possibly be a decent computer.
It's a bit sad they don't offer any bigger screen sizes, and no option with a GPU.
*It needs a larger touchscreen and more I/o ports and it would have a market with more users, particularly with those who run Hauptwerk software which requires 64 mega of RAM and a movable, upgradable computer.*
Fhdkchdnsksbf THEY NEED A TRANSPARENT CASE IF THEY HAVENT... No not a protective case, like a transparent bezel so you can see the inside components
Magnetic type C cables are already available (though you'll get a nub on the port) and i would buy that if my laptop charges through type C (i got one for my phone)
This video gave me a clear view on the sheer grudge that linus holds against dell XD
Why can't they make the CPU and GPU removable /upgradable and not soldered to the motherboard ??
This time, Linus is the sponser
Tech heads will appreciate, but the average consumer simply won't care and would prefer to pay a premium for convenience
only if there was a GPU option :/
i hope they make gaming laptop like this
Even if Framework folds tomorrow, you still have a fantastic laptop and there should be some used parts on Ebay. Certainly more parts than Apple will provide.  I'm loving mine, though sadly the screen may be too much resolution for my poor eyes.
I want to also add if there is ANY concern about needing to buy other IO modules, they are 10-20 dollars CHEAPER than buying an adapter from the store!
bruh linus you always need to drop somthing
🙏 from India
"They got a strong framework" oh my 😂😂 About the laptop is amazing. I wish someday we get a smartphone like that too, since Google promised it but never delivered it...
Do IKEA Laptop but it's upgradeable
Framework is an awesome company.  It's about time a company started doing this.  Patiently waiting for the 15" model.  Make it powerful, please.
I mean aren't all microsoft laptops easily repairable and upgradable?🤔
OWG,It's so cool
I just ordered one and I'm real excited. Looks like a super promising replacement for my old laptop and a fun project at the same time
I am completely sold on Framework's laptops. Also for the high end specs I'm looking for its way cheaper than I ever thought. Going for roughly the same specs of other laptops Ive been looking for, its way cheaper, and upgradable too! As a tech enthusiast, I do think upgradable laptops are a must have, and if I'm honest, Ive been looking for a while.
Would by one now if it was 9:16, also I know this is too much to ask but graphics card options?
Bezzle and different color LED keyboard is an upgrade ? LOL ,good luck to that company. Upgradeable lapptop would be: detachable CPU and GPU chip.
I bookmarked for when I get a laptop lol
Tbh 1000 dollar is expensive af. But i guess im not that kind of person that would buy a apple laptop. But if it would come down to chossing i rather buy a framework laptop that is so versatile, instead of a apple that would brake in seconds and the repair costs are more than the laptop itself.
heck ya
I hope those will be available in europe when i need to replace my laptop! Rapairability is the #1 feature I'm missing in electronics these days...
TL;DR Upgrades, people. Upgrades.
theres no market for these kind of laptops (esp gpu) youre better off with a normal one but i appreciate yhe concept
I actually prefer a thick bulky design over those flimsy looking ones, but its nice to see a thin laptop that can be upgraded. I dont want my laptop to feel like a tablet, I want it to feel like a laptop.
im not in the market for a laptop right now but in a couple years i might be so ill have to look into these laptops
i was actually going to buy a framework laptop for my college but they were out of my budget so now I've to deal with an ideapad that I bought. (I run linux and ideapads can be a bit of a pain)
Great if they had german or other keyboard layouts
After using some horrible Windows surface laptops that shattered the moment I tried to take the screen off I'm definitely going to look at one of these
Id rather get a normal laptop
Ok so where does the graphics card go?
For the flex stuff.  My Dell XPS 13... which was a *PREMIUM* ass laptop, is bent.   By bent I mean sit it on a flat surface and it wobbles slightly.  3 months of light use was all it took to get a permanent bend.    I can "bend" it back and eventually it it will wobble again. Flex is good.  Overall rigidity makes for laptops that bend and keep the bent shape.  Thunderbolt 3 in my XPS 13 is also abysmal and never works right with eGPUs.  Just bought a Framework laptop to replace my XPS. *flips table over*
Maybe they did it so that the users will do the dirty work for them
Call me when they make one with a 17.3" 3840x2160 display, Ryzen 9 6980HX CPU and dedicated graphics plus 2 x 2.5" HHD bays ans at least 2 M.2 slots that allow for cooled SSDs. and "mechanical" keyboard. Other than that I guess I'll have to keep letting XMG build my notebooks.
IBM in 2003: introducing IBM ThinkPad T41 consuments: AAA! I WILL GIVE YOU CORE 2 DUO!! AAA! I WILL ADD 2GB OF RAM!! AAA! I WILL ADD HIGHER CAPASITY BATTERY!!!
If framework does an anime collab I'm buying one.
For privacy concerned individuals, I can't imagine a better device
OMG, THANK YOU!  My wife does medical transcription and I have been lost in what to get her to replace her old laptops!  This is absolutely perfect!
I really want to buy one of these but I’m gonna wait till you can get a high end Ryzen APU. I’m not even asking for a dedicated graphics card, that would be annoying to make modular, but I would like a good APU at least.
If this kind of form factor have so much going for it... imagine a full CHUNGUS with like 10 slots. And an actual video card.
Looking gor internship there
11:44 Woah Linus this is an all-ages platform...
I also think these would be good for schools too because those are possibly beat to heck and back and instead of buying a new one or trusting like you know kids with others tech you can just fix it to and the I.T department will be much happier too
Linus connected the wifi module's wires not in the correct order. I was wondering if it still works.
I.... I think I found my new love now in a computer till my HP computer finally dies this will totally me mine one-day
Did you just say - PHISON U17 chip? 😎
This is a very attractive system. The only disappointment that I see with this setup is not having a dedicated charging port, even just a USB-C on the main board. You have to occupy one of your module ports to charge the machine, leaving only 3 usable ports. Hopefully they also release a standard SD card module in the near future, my usage that is more useful than the micro-SD slot.  If I have the budget, this would be at the top of my list. Also this fits perfectly with the ideology of the Open Source community.
THIS will be my next laptop. Fuck you, Dell :)
Hey Linus, why don't you try to make a DIY magnetic charging port yourself? People are 3D printing themselves now, and it seems to work great!
Laptops should come with a mouse instead of a trackpad. Those things are so annoying to use
Feel like I need to buy one just to support them
I hope this becomes the new trend.
well cool laptop, i will definitely buy it if expansion available for Serial and RJ45 ports.
16:20 I never knew that laptop batteries swelled when constantly plugged in.  This thing looks awesome! Would love to have one!
I'd buy there laptops without thinking too much.
That dell joke was hilarious 😂😂😂🤮🤮🤮
My clevo laptop its reperabel i can change the cpu gpu ram wifi hdd easy... an this thing is from 2007
11:27 you actually explain the real problem if the mother board cant be changed there's no actual point of upgradability
11:35 oh come onn, some of the old latidude workstations are good up to this day, I don't know how, but my mom's laptop is working perfectly fine and it was a dell latitude e6400 bought in 2006 or 2006. With Code 2 Duo and 4gb of 800 DDR2 ram, 1tb hdd and quadro m160 still working with widows 10 (enterprise n) and not being too slow for a normal every day work (Microsoft exel, word, watching YouTube, tennis, ect) and I cannot wait to see how it will work when we upgrade from windows to Linux! It will fly! There's a lot more to it, it's build like a tank (a freaking radio that weights more than 2 kilos fell on it and scraped the top of the laptop while closed, still works, speakers are awesome, the dock station is running perfectly fine, heck, I was able to get on hypixel (minecraft) leaderboards in 2018 on 50fps! It's lovely piece of tech that I would love to use, just because of how I grew up with it! I'm scared of what I will see if I'm defragging the hdd, it's not been touched since 2017!
LINUS WHAT THE FUCK IS 11:55?!?!?!?!!?
Framework. Why? Because fuck Apple that's why.
Whys he in his kitchen
I've lost two decent (then) laptops because of Battery Fatigue. If they can get one without the IntelManagementEngine - I'll never choose another brand. I'm done with Macs anyway.
Wow sweet
>RISC-V   BOY I HOPE SO woooooo
The two computers I want them to make:  Hybrid (with touch-screen capabilities), 360° computer (like the Envy HP laptop) and an upgradable gaming laptop.
Thank you for video!
i would loooove this laptop
Pls just dont sell this company to google or any other big corp.
So this is pro-consumerism?
Amazing 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Now we just need Framework to make a gaming laptop that can be upgraded like a PC and be portable too. I will buy immediatly
11:56
Wouldn’t it be easier to make everything upgradable
Hmm I wonder can you ship back old components and get some kinda credit for next purchase 🤔
And now i deeply regret buying that asus laptop a year ago X/
Right now I'm considering between this and a 2012 MacBook Pro for the future. Might go for this.
"Like every other laptop the CPU is soldered directly to the board."  T440p says hellp.
"build your laptop" is gonna be a cool thing and easy too
can it play games at max rez?
Hi there, i just wanna say thid is the second time i saw this video and i really want one, why should i even touch any other brand if my device might die in 5 years and i cant get any repair? I will buy one of framework.
If this vid was uploaded 5 months ago, i would have bought this lap
How major companies will react about that?
It's a shame they're not shipping to Australia yet.
I'm buying this in a year when I enter college next year
16:18 my 2012 ThinkPad has that too
Welcome to another episode of Linus Drop Tips :P
The product is still way too expensive, no matter what upgrades you can do to it. Not worth the money.
A linux distro preinstalled would be nice!
11:53 lolol
Me: _hacks Magsafe 3 onto the Framework Laptop_  Everyone: *WAIT THAT'S ILLEGAL*
Color coded screws? *Spare* screws?! ALL WITH THE SAME BIT?! And I repeat myself, but COLOR CODED?!?! God damn, that is beautiful.
Actually this is the core about *Nature Environmental Damage*, *STUBBORNNESS TECH COMPANY DISALLOWING REPAIRABILITY AND UPGRADABILITY*, Luckily some companies recognizes
I.LOVE.THAT.LAPTOP. it's better then mine is more upgradable then mine and flex's less
322 because youre phone dosnt use qr
11:55 the soy awakening...
"Beautiful macbook" ...really though? Overprized plastic...
That is so goddam cool!
Open source device drivers?
the modularity is super cool but 1000$ for a i5 11th gen and 256gb of memory laptop doesnt sound very nice
as thinkpads upgradeability goes away, here comes the new contender, more modern and modular
Interesting concept, but most of these things can be replaced fairly easily in most laptops, so long as you avoid the ones with soldered on ram. The expansion cards seem to be pretty basic as just USB c connectors for storage or things like HDMI ports. it's not like you can upgrade the CPU/gpu, which is the biggest thing holding back an old laptop. I've never had a laptop die before those components began to feel slow and dated.
That. Is. Awesome!!
Framework has chassis intrusion sensors.  The difference is they don't lock you out of your device, just let you (or an admin) know that your laptop was opened and, if you didn't consent to that, you should check into that.
10:18 Linus you’re kidding. 64 gigs of ddr4 ram.
i love the dell joke
thats actual dope though. oem supporting right to repair
This is so cool
Seems cool, but I’d wait a year or two first. Right now its the same price as a MacBook so the real question is will it be big enough for framework to stay in buisness and continue support.
I’ll probably get one if they get gaming versions
for the first time, linus did NOT criticize a product.
I love watching this video on my Framework....
This laptop is a must buy for me - everything flexed here is just worth spending my cash for. Hopefully this company succeeds and expands its components to allow for touch screen displays, and mobile GPUs like the 3050 Ti
the start of an era
This Laptop is like LEGO for Tech Nerds
I have no idea why I came back to this channel. I guess it's the yearly re reminder that linus is clickbait an corporate 😒
Ok linus let say this I love and I have been watching your videos for about 6-5 years now So this not the comment of a hater rather me wanting you to set things straight ( to everyone reading correct me if I’m wrong ) You said in the video between 2:40 and 3:00 time that you will save about 300$ if you buy the diy kit in fact you would save 20 dollars or might even lose money if you pick the choice of the company sending you a copy of Windows with the computer so if you could explain it in your next wan show and finally love you and your team 🧡🧡
I want this but a phone.
This reminds me of the phone google tried making which was the same concept  though problems came when what if people wanted bigger displays and such. It was almost the same thing except it was hardware and not ports
Make a model with Ryzen processors and a numpad option then I'm sold.
We need more technology like this well done linus!
“The Dell is not even fucking thinner!”
I want one
FUCK YES FINALLY
Favorite channel
handsome
Set your power to switch on a few mins before you start work... Auto power on... Log in when you sit down! Saves sitting through boot up!
Linus I understand you have stock in the company but that is not ultrabook thin lmao
All it needs is a 2070 and ill buy it
Linus, Thanks for the recommendation! I have purchased the Framework diy edition. I knew what I was buying but I was still impressed by what I got.
This wil be my next laptop, I hope this company make more tech products, we need these kind of pioneers, im stoked, finally a wish that came true!
7:40 same linus i understand it's annoying
Third party upgrades anyone ??
I like the concept, but I think it's too expensive.  Poor price/performance ratio.  I'll keep watching.
Linus: Laptop CPUs cannot be swapped out  Me and all other outdated laptop users: *Laughs in G2*
Finally some one that uses a wired mouse and it hits their hand I hate that but nobody says anything about
Cough cough NEC
Started watching; bookmarked to watch tonight with the wife. I suspect this video will be a good argument for my next upgrade; which is due now.  Hope the speakers are ok or at least as good as my current 13" Air...
man if they may like a dell rugged sorta case for this, i would buy it instantly
i can not even take repalce the ram from my Samsung laptop (notebook pro 9)
what these guys fail to understand is that the average person which makes the majority of people dont care about all this and thats why apple is still making millions selling macs.
i wats tis on lenovo
nice that you mention QR codes because my crappy phone can't scan them. still love the laptop though
While I am not investing, I have purchased a number of these for myself, my family and my business and have been extremely happy with the product and the service I have received.
I hope one day there will be laptops with upgradable graphics then I’ll be on board
Can u make this a super upgrade of the laptop. I want to see it getting push to the limit
They've got a strong framework. I died.
about half a year later and framework still exists. I just ordered myself one.
i want this so badly
5:08 the cardboard case looks like a bento box full of tech. and just like a real bento box you get exited when you see it
11:53 YOU'RE ALL WELCOME!
if they building  upgradable gaming laptop I would buy it
I want one of these so bad!! Great work framework! Thank you Linus for your support 😉
this is so cool they really thought of everything.
I really want to buy one of these laptops. However, I am waiting for something higher end then a quad core and maybe better displays. I am not asking for a gaming laptop just something a little higher end. Finger crossed for more upgrades in the future.
why is their website only showing  up i german, trying to change it does nothing :/
I want this laptop! It's so cool...
It's a waste I was on the site the prices are very high for this price you can buy a laptop with a 3080 or 3090 graphics card which will be coming soon. Probably, work is underway on new processors and new video cards 4000 and probably in the future the laptops will be thin and super super manufacturers.
Too bad the human condition is the desire to say "I have a Mac." pshhhhh
Company Apple <--- A bad company that  don't really care about consumers and users
Holy fook.....that's the best webcam I have ever seen in a laptop......my 2000 dollar laptop doesn't even have a webcam ffs 😪
Sure, it doesn’t have an AMD chip, ethernet port, touch screen, or dual fan cooling. But it’s certainly good enough for most things a casual user or most software developers would want. And with the promise of repairability, upgradability, great support, love for Linux, I’m sold!
I have been thinking they need to or should have developed a way to sink and deal with heat and such in a way that we can just plug and play all parts from power-supply to motherboard maybe even processor so that we can plug and play each piece and thus not need a tower like one of the other things you talked about for a graphics card or hard-drives and such. I even thought it might be interesting to do things such that you get computers designed to a point like legos you could plug and play extras or such and just stack them maybe.
*Just imagine removing mobo and putting it in tablet case with battery and display and U got a high performance fully upgradable windows tablet better than surface in your pocket.*
I would like it if they made one that was compatible with graphics cards as that is a big one for me getting a new laptop.
hmmm'
This reminds me of Project Ara from Google, and I love the concept. Also, about the magnetic charging port comments, I wonder if the menagerie of magnetic cables on amazon would function just fine with this as a charging cable...
but it doesnt have upgrable graphics. opportunity missed
Don’t let the military see this they love modular and repairable for 60 years
i love this
Can Framework make a "Gaming" version ?
Cool, I love it.
Not sure how leaving this video up after you invested in the company in any way ethically ok. LTT really likes to blur the line between a review channel and a corporate shill. shill - an accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others
Modular IO seems like the most gimmicky gimmick I have ever herd. And other than that, they gave instructions on repairing the laptop and provided the HOT TIP that you could take your outdated laptop and use it as a desktop in five years! AMAZING! what a great experience that would be.  Socketed ram is nice, but plenty of companies do that. This is maybe the least exciting product I've ever seen.
its like lego....but not
this is too fucking cool, we need to see way more of this from mass produced tech
The clear key caps are badass
yay
"It is simply not possible to build a device that is both elegant and repairable" pc's?🤨😅
Know what's better? Putting Linux on it.
They come with a screwdriver.
Un gran producto
i wonder how it would support ubuntu
I am absolutely sold on Frameworks' idea and product
Hi guys, I own a Lenovo g510, it's a good and easy laptop to open to work around, just 2 screws. On the side of the battery. I think it's the last one they make it so good.
Just ordered my framework notebook seconds ago, preorder for Germany started today !
Cool, when AMD CPUS ??
Remember when you recommended the area 51m and I got it ... and then they didn't have any upgrades for it... ohh that was great
Can this thing do gpus?  Feel like that might be a weakpoint
I liked the points made, but @11:57 was most informative.
They could also make a statement and make it ship without the Intel ME spyware 🌝
8:18 "The Linus". Not an LTT originao video without the trademark.
Bring them in the EU pls
I use a wired mouse too because wireless mice have very noticeable latency issues
11:53 hi zoomer editor
I was so excited and about to buy one until I saw it’s specs couldn’t handle my work load 😭.
"IT'S NOT EVEN F***ING THINNER!"
Don't shake it like that! D: I feel like you will break it any moment.
They need Thunderbolt and or a graphics card option(s)
They could make 100% upgradable anything 20 years ago. Bit they want you to spend more money and Just buy a Total New 1. The rich People in controll dont like this type of devices so they wont become a thing, welcome to earth
Love it! Would prefer a slightly larger model where the extra space is just for extra airflow with improved cooling.
To be honest, it doesn't make much sense for me. A motherboard (with CPU) for Framework is 700 - 1000$. Which is approximately the same amount it would cost me to entirely replace a Macbook or XPS once every 3 years. Maybe for the upgradable RAM and storage, but it's not a big deal there either.  The biggest deal for me is that a laptop it came to cost 2000 - 2500$, a phone 1000 $. Apple has around $ 100 billion profit every year.
Fairphone In Smartphones And Framework In Laptops Are Good sign For Right to Repair.
11:54 wtf
The only problem is that it's not particularly good looking
Will there be a version with a dedicated graphics card?
14:41 it's ok, My wife takes everything from me what she likes. I got these killer boxer shorts from Korea one time, and she was like "I need some shorts! thnx babe!" now it's her boxer shorts now.
It's never been about looks. It's about making money through obsolescence. There should be laws against that.
When my Surface Pro 6 kicks the bucket, I will actually be looking at this as a replacement. I hope they succeed!
If you get one of those mag safe like phone charger cables that can manage the power you have that allready.
In regards to barking at apple, this video didnt age well. Apple already announced a Self Service Repair program
Man, what a product.
Nice laptop. You should invest in the company
This feels like Linux or LibreOffice, or Blender. It won't replace the mainstream, but smart people will make amazing use of it and make others jealous. Plus, simply existing as an option will pressures the corporations to not get too greedy
I was sold, then I noticed they don't have any models with a gpu. I will keep them bookmarked, but hold out on a purchase. I use my lappy for casual gaming when not at the desktop. No gpu is a hard sell for my needs.
As soon as this has a Ryzen option, I'm there, this concept is something I've been wanting for a long time and this seems to be the most competent execution of it so far
I would have gotten one if they had a tablet form or GPU options.
The problem now is the obsolescence that came from software. For how long will this CPU be supported by new versions of Windows? Nevertheless, I'm a big fan of DIY repairs and #righttorepair, and this laptop looks awesome!!
Got one for my son
All they need now is a few display* monitor versions. Although you can just plug it into a monitor with that DP port.
Buen vídeos
I do not like the ultrathin laptop trend that Apple started.  RAM is usually soldered, completely not user serviceable, and sometimes the SSD is soldered
Happy linus noises
What does one need an upgradable laptop for? I have been using the same MacBook for over ten years now and it still works just fine. How much more lifetime do you hope to get out of a machine like that, especially since the displays will degrade over time and keyboards tend to get less reliable, too?
just ordered one :)
Got my laptop and so far it's been worth every cent probably wouldn't have done it without checking this vid
Due of most people watching this can't afford it, and there are macbooks made to flex with, this thing will get lost in the underrated things place
gawd this mans voice is annoying
Framework is currently the subject of a class presentation I need to deliver. I have never been more excited for a presentation!
Well... I've been using a FairPhone 2 for 2 1/2 years precisely because I broke my Samsung's screen and was told it'd cost about half the price of the phone (when new) to have it fixed by a pro... And I've pulled my hair a number of times with my current laptop due to problems with the screen (I've had to replace the cable that feeds it twice and it's a nightmare to do)... I'd say this could be my next move, similar to the FairPhone but with a laptop! Thanks for the review, that was helpful.
zbook g2?
Who's ever screwed a long screw up through the keyboard. Not a good feeling lol.
This has been SO LONG in coming. I remember that Razer. I was elated.
I have been looking for a new laptop...  Looks like I just found it.
Next time I buy a laptop, this will be it👍
You are hella cute
Nice job bro you just got a sub
Watching this on my Framework right now! Thank you for posting this video, I wouldn't have found this amazing laptop without it!
Dell XPS 15 is not the gold standard for flex, that honor goes to the current Lenovo T series, or Thinkpads. Although no longer made by IBM, Lenovo does just as good building them. Flex proof.
Can u do a video about what would happen if the framework laptop dye?
This will be my next laptop. Love the concept.
frameworks dont ship to sweden :c
.....Damn.....these guys deserve a Nobel peace prize in engineering for this laptop!
I would if they offer Ryzen as option with graphics
That's why i miss the early 2010's with goodies like Thinkpads or the Dell Precision lineup. Those PCs were modular AF and nearly everything was swappable, with the Dell even the graphis unit. I'm no boomer, but i am still so used to the trackpoint mouse, that even a huge 1-button trackpad or fancy new IPS/OLED still stand under the impact on my comfort working on one of these things.
😭😭😭😭 I am crying right now. Framework, please make one with a screen that goes 360° and add touch and stylus (like an HP Spectre x360), and I PROMISE I WILL BUY IT. Please make one!!! 😭😭😭😭
This dude's glow up has been absolutely insane
This is the sort of product that that makes you feel like you own the machine. It will build a cult following.
sucks it took until 2021 for these types of products to come out! companies shudda been doing this back in 2010!
Come to India it will be a hit 😀
Even tho it’s modular…how powerful is this thing really? I like lightweight laptops but how powerful is this laptop and how expensive can this framework laptop get?  Update: $700 price point for laptop not bad but doesn’t support AMD or Nvidia GPU…would need to get a eGPU AMD or Nvidia wise to plug into this thing…framework laptop has intel processor …certainly not for video editing, music production, VFX work on this laptop but maybe enough for programming and office productivity…
2.2k Apple users didn't enjoy this video.
👌Waiting for a 17 inch model
Biggest downside is the lack of powerful GPUs. However I wish I had seen this before buying a thin notebook with intel iris which is what you get with the framework. lol
The coolest thing ive seen this month
Hi I am looking for a new laptop. If framework had a 15 or  15.6 in 4k and a 3080 card I would buy it right now. If that doesn't happen soon I will be. Buying a XPS 17 Dell or Asus duo in 15 inch. Will those changes be available in framework any time soon? I as because I am diabetic and need a screen over 15 inches. Any reply would do as I am running a 10 year old HP I use with 3 screens but it's getting slow and will be purchasing a new laptop very soon. Thank you.
I will absolutely buy one of these in the future if they put a good touchscreen with pen support and GPU in it! Really hoping that's their next step.
framework and dbrand collab when?
you cant compare the MacBooks from a software side
So, since Framework ain't shipping to my home country (Australia) all I can do is wait till they start shipping here. However the MOMENT I see the email that they are, I'm swiping one in a heartbeat. ❤️
This is my next laptop I leave mine plugged in a lot and the battery disconnect is huge for me and then you get the repairability meaning longer term use ect ect
The best part was "THE DELL'S NOT EVEN FUCKING THINNER"
Watch this company go bankrupt
ok now I want Framework gaming DIY laptop
me gusta..but 13.5 inches. 749$ is doable tho. and i would really really REALLY like to see a 17" one. doing 3d on a 13 inch laptop is hell.
I use a wired mouse and have the same USB port pet peeve. Lol.
I totally expected to see Ubuntu/Arch/Fedora/Debian being the default OS, but ah well, it will take a measly 5 minutes.  Lots of love to people at framework. Awesome job.
i hope this will be the norm in the near future
The first step toward PC level laptops Imagine Manually built laptops That's the dream
I hate the obsession with thin laptops. It is the prime excuse for removing functionality. This Framework lot would do a better job if they embraced the chonk and made putting in even more functionality a selling point.
But all the components are still manufactured in the PRC. So luckily, here you can keep buying new ones to put in all the time!
Gujarati name spotted... on the team 😆
I like your kitchen. You have a nice kitchen.
(Cough) Dell
If it wasnt for LTT how would i come across this laptop. Im def ordering this for Christmas !!!
KEYBOARDS LINUS, KEYBOARDS!!!! I can't tell you how many make you FULLY dismantle the laptop just to replace a damn keyboard, a moving part likely to fail!  That's gigantic when laptops that used to have 2-3 screws in the bottom that held it in feel almost non-existent today.
My only big issue is they need it in a 15"+ form factor, laptop screens are already rather small by today's standard, I'd have a tough time using a 13" as an actual daily driver, plus it allows for a larger keyboard.  And yes I know, displayport, external screens, blah blah....I'm talking about when you're just using the laptop as a laptop, not a desktop.
Is there is no GPU
Motherboard is what i upgrade from time to time. No options to upgrade motherboard. CPU is soldered, not upgradeable. When you "repurpose your motherboard", what are you doing with the rest of the kit? The case, screen etc? SOrry i dont see how this is too much better.
So now, I want one.
The miracle of the laptop survives his gestures.
So is the goodix reader linux driver native to the framework? I thought they were pretty firm on their stance to not support open source thus nixing linux as a whole.
Wish had the money to invest; I'd definitely.
This is so cool, and not that bad of price
Send this link to Apple, Samsung, Dell, HP and lenovo. Maybe they can learn something about what customer really wants...
One of my first Notebooks i got in a Company was the Toshiba Tecra S1. I really loved that notebook becaus it had a swappable HDD slot and CD/DVD slot. Due to my work and the incompatibility between certain Software and Windows at the same installation it was just perfect. I went to one Plant and used the Whole System one the 1 HDD and on another Plant with different Hardware the 2nd one. It just would cost me a minute to swap and start the notebook again. even upgrading to bigger HDD was as easy as loosing 1 screw. I always have been wondering why nobody is actually building such systems.
A type c adapter that plugs into a type c port?
Looks like I found my next laptop! This is so amazing and I wish more companies did this.
I have been waiting for something like this for years.
Finally a device, where broken port is not a big deal. Simply replace a "cartridge"... PS There is a great money in custom cases. Personally I know couple guys who would invest into carbon. And think pf all this sheikhs spending a fortune for precious metal and gem plating.
Nice
I think with a more gamer-focused thicker laptop they could put a socketed chip in it other brands have done this with Ryzen so it could be done. Even more likely as time goes on and the low power versions get lower and lower-powered and start crossing into normal laptop wattages.
USB C 3.2 .... do they have an external GPU available ?!?
This is against capitalism 🥰
If you watch Louis Rossmann he'll tell you the big problem with fixing an Apple are the sneaky ways Apple will brick a machine when you try to repair it.
This would be a perfect laptop for offices.
I like the concept but i also think it's a bit too much.
Sold by 8 minutes in!
Let's make this company the Tesla of laptops.
I was buying second hand upgradable  old Thinkpad... That's what I was doing.
Best laptop ever. I hope it will be available for European customers.
So... all those little IO cards are just USB C ? Meaning you can use them on another computer with an USB C port ??
They got a strong framework.... I died!!! That was so on point!
Looked at their prices. Very, very comparable to other market giants. I know what my next laptop’s gonna be.
This would be amazing for schools, in that students could get the joy of building and getting to understand their hardware, and the school could with such greater ease aquire and install replacement-parts if something breaks (which always happens)
Waiting for it to be available in Mexico uwu… Also, can someone explain me what is the 100 dólar deposit for?
I've never been excited about a laptop in my entire life. This is so cool.
Starting saving to buy one...
what is the brand of that laptop. really want to buy 1
I can't believe that a touchpad video clip was used during the milking of this teet.  LMAO
Framework company showed a big middle finger to Apple company and I love it!
Apple, take notes.
If they are releasing one with amd I ll want one, and even now... Wooow
Give us an amd version pls framework
Oh man please let this work! i feel bad every time i sell my old laptops.
Why not upgradeable CPU? (HP laptop engineer laugh when heard this)
What's the average duty's cost if you buy in Canada ? Do I need to expect a suprise bill ?
As soon as they drop a 15 inch model you best believe I’m getting one!
but it's very expensive.
changing out GPUs is the most difficult thing to upgrade on a laptop,  it's really is the bottleneck on my 2014 gaming laptop.
me on a 2010 piece of crap
I bought one of these laptops, I got the model with the i5-1135g7 becuase in my research it's performance wasn't significantly different from the I7. I bought mine with the least hardware i could except for the charger and ports (TypeC, HDMI, usb x2). I took components (32gb ddr4, 2Tb 980 pro, intel AC9260) from my Lenovo P1 Gen 1 (I7-8850H & Quadro P2000) Which i had expected this to be a straight downgrade as the 8850H is a more powerful cpu and the dedicated GPU should be much better in gaming related tasks.   I was not prepared for the amount of difference the encoding improvements in the i5 1135g7 made to my experience. For the first time, I could stream games over my local network without any significant loss of quality. Previously when attempting to do this on my P1 even at 720p i was bottlenecked by the rate at which the cpu could decode the incoming stream from my desktop (5900x & 3080 ti). Now I can stream at my laptops native 2k resolution without any artifacting whatsoever.   I also found the improvements to integrated graphics to be good at running even newer games (tested Humankind) at medium settings. (Of course it's not as good as the P2000, which is about equivalent to a 1060 6gb, but the difference is high settings vs medium settings). Which is the highest level of performance id need on the move. Combine all that with the brighter 3:2 14in screen with great battery life (i use my laptop in my car for work a lot) this laptop has been outstanding.   I had concerns about lacking camera windows hello, but the finger print sensor is of high quality and wakes quicker without accidentally waking the device and logging into the wrong account. (Useful when you have work and personal accounts)  I am very happy with my Framework laptop and I am confident i can replace any part that could fail, I will use this laptop for many years.
I want one and i want to support them too.
why dont just make a Thinkpad X1 without everyting soldered to the board? I mean a X1 made like a T430... On the T430 you can switch to a FUll HD Display as simple as with the framework Laptop...The T430 was one of the best upgradeable Laptops ever made. You could even change the CPU...
when i go to my next school i think ima get one. this chromebook stinks
Honestly I love modular things like this. Why isn’t everything like this? I think that everything should be modular!
Like... "APPLE!?" so emphasized 😝😝😝🤣🤣🤣
That " Activate windows" shows even with this innovative design it will keep you stuck.
My laptop has a socketed CPU. Well, one of them has it.
A fully upgradable modular laptop would friggin kill everything on the market. And manufacturers know this...
I just recieved an email that batch 5 is finally shipping. Even though I dont live in the US, thats not stopping me from getting the laptop of my dreams.
Wonder what ever happened to that company (or maybe it was a kickstarter) that was this same concept but with a smart phone. So if you wanted a huge battery you could have a bigger battery and a smaller 1unit camera, or if you wanted a really nice camera or cameras then you could sacrifice the size of the battery back peice etc and many other options / and removable /replaceable peices. Honestly don't remember if they snapped in together or if they were part magnetic, but it was a cool idea especially for instances if you like shattered your phone screen
Dude! I am not joking. If I had liquid cash, I would have ordered it. The question is whether they have an EU charging cable
It's less flexible than HP laptops
This is peak Linus
TOUCHSCREEEN
How to buy this laptop???
I AM going to buy this right now
That's cool but i want android version on arm
Any serious engineer would be ashamed to say "well to make it a good product I have to make it unmaintainable". That's just crap. That's what engineering is all about. Any idiot can design something that you have to throw away if a part breaks. That's not engineering.
He coughed and spitted dell at the same time.
I think people think he's selling out, but I think he's just ecstatic with it.
Crazy glue
It looks very flimsy and disposable I doubt it would last long enough by the time end user gets it. It be nice to see some quality.
Oh, I always thought Dell was a hardware company. Now I realize I should have been wearing a mask for all these years so I didn't get the Dell virus....
This is the kind of “review” you watch when you just bought a product and want to justify your purchase. The ONLY even slightly negative thing in this entire video would be “how do they make money?” And “no touchscreen” if you count that. Seriously what does “a reasonable amount of flex” even mean? It could mean “there is so much flex but reprisals so no biggie” to “wow this is so close to the XPS 15”. Whilst I understand this is a very exciting product and it seems truly great more nuanced coverage would have been much appreciated. Something major I can think of with very little research is early adopter’s tax, for example.
60hz? Free is too much for a device with 60hz display.
01:58 - that phone could really use a dbrand skin!
Let it growwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Ooo
My mother was a network engineer, I actually remember asking her well over twenty five years ago, why all computers didn’t do this, when it would be better for people and the environment, and I remember it partially because it was not only one of the few times in my childhood she just flat out could not come up with an answer for me, but she actually got kinda mad at me when I kept asking, and I wasn’t allowed to go to the computer camp we’d been checking out for summer.  On a side note, if you can make the general keyboards changeable, could you not also make different types of specialty keyboards, such as dual screen or tablet screen, that could be subbed on to the bass chassis for persons such as artists, designers, and those in stem fields, who might need them?
im sold. can i buy this in canada
Awesome.
"CPU soldered in a fully upgradeable laptop". Linus, this video is just disappointing
Imagine if they made the website into a similar concept as Steam, but for computer parts for the laptop. Anyone who comes up with legit good ideas for the computer could put it directly onto the website, meaning they could more easily get publicity for it, while also framework could take a little bit of the cut. I feel that could greatly encourage a good community around the laptop, people making parts that work well, or make it look cooler. And the people who get to upgrade to whatever parts they want that are created
I ordered mine today!
I like the thick ones. People complain about weight, but I am strong enough to lift even 4kg. Legendary.
But can it game?
Fantastic. What OS options do these have?
11:54 me when i discover i can pee in white
imagine not having a 7 year old dell laptop, having replaced the laptop ram, harddrive to SSD, new fan, 3  USB port changes over the span of a few years, and don't forget the good ol' wasd keys falling out
15:20 false. my Lenovo has a magnetic port.
Can tell how much Linus loves it by how higher pitch he is
This is damn close to my dream laptop. Been a long time since I’ve been excited about new tech. The framework hardware maybe enough to pull me away from the Apple ecosystem.
Would be awesome if they would do it on a standart thin laptop (not  air size) so that you could get more slots on sides and upgradable MXM GPU module
My next laptop
I hope they do well
i think I'm going to give it a try
looking for a new dj/production laptop wonder how this one would perform ????
very cool
I just noticed: you mixed up the connection of the wireless cables. not that it matters, probably.
What's the point in a laptop when you can't quick change the battery?
2:00 With the “Anti iPhone” video it shows that tech companies could make anything upgradable, but won’t because they’re too greedy and lazy
v2.0, make those expandable ports smaller and offer up to 6 of them :) Also, while motherboards and processor makers won't allow for it, if only we could also upgrade the motherboard 2-3 years down the line without having to throw the laptop away. (This is pretty hard though.)
Goodbye Apple, hello Framework :)
seeing linus happy makes me happy
Wow
i hope by the time i worn out my current laptop.. they've got a large version and ship to the Netherlands.
Just make a fake carbon fibre thing on the outside and it won’t look like it’s from 2010
I have a similar idea for a different tech market 👀
Would love my work to adopt these laptops so we don’t have so many ugly dongles all over the place. Multiple array of video output modules 🙌🏼
Linus I would buy the framework laptop as my next machine if they used ryzen processors. Please start a poll about this and you will find that many people are waiting for the amd version since the amd cpus are right now far superior to intels. I also lets me game on the laptop with integrated graphics.
Damn, can't wait for the model with larger screen
I remember a phone concept with this same model a few years back. The name escapes me
How linux compatible is this laptop? Is there a sacrifice on the battery life? I wish these results were avalable for me to consider this even more seriously
They really think on their users
"They have a strong framework" - 16:55
1:57 damn linus DROP(phone) tips at it again
So I noticed this laptop is 3:2 aspect ratio, does anyone know if it can be run in 16:9 with upper/lower letter boxing?
I'll wait for the knockoff version of china
wired mice are more accurate, cant be messed with via interference.
I absolutely would buy it if I needed a laptop, however they don't ship in Italy yet so. I. Will. Wait.
When they get touch screens I’m buying one immediately
I actually wrote a long comment comparing the price range of a Framework Laptop with a Dell (Alienware M15 R6 Gaming Laptop to be precise), but couldn't post it publicly for whatever reason.. So just the gist / bottom line: the Framework Laptop is $1,975.00 - not the barebones option, otherwise known as the bring your own stuff option, but the one with an actual SSD (1TB), 16GB RAM, WiFi, Win 10 Home, power adapter, ports.. The Alienware (order code WNR6M15EYTUS), similar specs but with a dedicated graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 6GB) is $1,916.00 .. so much for the notion of this being such a socialist machine, designed by engineers who have the consumer in mind.. no Linus, it's just a gimmick that you can pay to put together.. but anyway, I hope you do good on your investment..
Also, windows is an optional purchase. Idk if people care, but it's nice
Hey guys in the comments, you can keep them afloat by buying their product or suggesting it to your tech-nerd friends. We're not converting Mac users, but we will convert anyone who wants this and lots of people do
Apple will probably buy them for X billion dollars and shut them down long before they become a threat! lol
Ok, but the most important thing: Can you set fan speed by yourself? idc if it's advanced or not, if it's there, I'm going to buy one.
this video is so amazing; I keep coming back and re-watching it....hehe. anyone else does that too? love this laptop man!!! I'm in love!!!!
That's going to be my next laptop. Period!
SUPER impressed! Just bought one
Apple: Let's go green to save the earth Also Apple: Throw away all of our previous product for our new product so we can waste more materials to make more money
What the- I am having goosebumps. Is this a dream?! Does a laptop like this really exist somewhere out there?!
Hi, it is mega disgusting. Peace.
I would so love a 17" matte screen option
If I didn’t already have a very solid gaming laptop I would purchase this in a heart beat
I would really, really love to see companies go in this design direction.  If they actually cared about the environment, like they claim to (i.e. no power bricks in new phones) they'd adopt this design philosophy. But it's obvious that they don't actually care and they are just saving $10/unit on a power brick.
if it has dedicated GPU then I'm getting one..
This is a gimmick. Computer builders have been able to do this for a long time.  You still have to buy all the parts to upgrade from Framework and I don't see it faring well with a liquid spill. It's a neat idea but I'll stick with my ROG laptops.  You can't even get this thing with a discrete graphics card. It's probably great for the average office worker or business specialist that travels but let's face it. It's nothing special.  And how do we know Linus isn't already invested and/or taking payment to promote like 95% of the channels out there.
This is amazing! Wow I have a MacBook Pro but I still want this
7:19 I think the port is redundant lol
Thing looks more attractive then a Macbook air
I have never more wished that I needed a laptop when I didn't than right now.  This is awesome.
Hold up didn’t g skill buy the sponsor spot
There's no profit in upgradeable and repairable high tech. There's money in making the buyers keep paying for new technologies.
Funy I just disassemble an old 2007 toshiba laptop, and as an engineer I can see how it was very easy on 2007 to make a product like this possible, any how I was disassembling it because I know I can use the oprical drives and other components in my newly built PC.
It's possible change the processor?
This is amazing you have really easy to store 1tb blocks that slot in. You could buy buy alot of the blocks and have unlimited storage. Have one for photos one for games (lets be honest more than one) have one for videos or data or whatever you could easily have the best of both worlds of physical copies and network connection!!!!!
If these guys are still a thing when the time comes I will definitely be getting one for my little sister so that she doesn’t have to worry about getting a whole new laptop whenever she needs to upgrade. If this was in high school I probably would’ve gotten it but right now I am running a MSI GE 76
where's the GPU?
I’d love to get one, but their website is not very accessible to the blind. When going to the configuration page, everything is presented in images which aren’t accessible to screen readers. I’m sure they’ll fix that though if it’s politely brought to their attention.
This is what happens when you get engineers together who worked for various companies and felt repressed by what they could do and they come together and make something better.  We see this a lot now days with game studios.
Framework and dbrand partnership would be sick for custom keyboards, bezels etc
this laptop maks me cry tears of joy. sadly im not in the makrt for a new on jet.
If only they made desktops like this too.
I was pretty far into the video and my thoughts were "That's pretty cool but I don't feel like I wanna buy it" and then I got to 16:30 and heard about the battery disconnect which immediately changed my mind to "Oh my god take all of my money right this instant"
Linus: "If you have your laptop plugged into wall that can cause battery swelling and be a fire hazzard" Me who has had my dell inspiron 17 plugged to a wall for 5 years straight: *"im in danger"*  P.s. it barely runs rocket league above 60 fps low settings and lowered resolution. Its pain. Pure pain.. dont have a job so i cant buy an actual pc.. fml.
bro I have a laptop that I bought 2 years ago, I dont want to sell it bc is going strong but this is making me REALLY want to sell it
Is anyone else horrified how fucked Linus phone was
"Why do I use a wired mouse" you have to use a wired mouse no reason to but you have to
They should make a hardware crypto wallet module.
This video is depressing. Makes me realize how amazing the world could be, but instead the overwhelming majority of all corporations are completely blinded by greed and deliberately pick worse or even bad solutions just to squeeze out as much money as possible from their customers.
if there was a model with gpu it would also be an instant buy for me
Which Gen is the USB 3.2?
Whats crazy is that this is becoming a real option for me. I just bought a top of the line Macbook Pro and honestly I am kinda unimpressed. I have had Macbooks for years and they were bomb proof, now I feel like I am holding a piece of paper. The keyboard as well is dogshit for this price. Sticky keys etc. I am losing my mind with this thing.
Gimme a beefy one with gaming performance and a numpad pls?
are there going to be AMD cpus?
In the aspect of recycling or usage time (if the requirements of the hardware dont increase) the best choice to reduce elektrical waist!
Am I the only one who is not interested in having touch screen for a laptop? I’m struggling to think of a reason why I’d need it 🤔
3 million old Lenovo ThinkPad owners like this.
Make it a hybrid and I'd definitely pick it up for my next upgrade. I use tablet mode every single time I use my PC. But I love this concept!
“The dells not even fucking thinner” LOL
Who moosh it cost?
i didnt get the full size  display port  port thing that he said
not sure how many port a motherboard can support but I think it will be better to prebuilt some usbc ports coz it's really not enough input for normal user
And yet ill still be happier using the m1 mac.  I get the principle of repairability but for me user experience beats all.
i want to support framework laptops but they are too dang expensive!
Get this in to UK PLEASE!!!!!!     I was going to buy a laptop for the end of this year but Im happy to wait months and get this!
Its a laptop why would you want to upgrade it
This looks fantastic. I'm buying one.
That girlfriend joke is gold!
Ok, that's my next upgrade
This truly is so perfect
9:56 You mean you don´t care, right? 11:34 Ooh, that's a nasty cough! 14:47 Wait, what?!
This idea is great, but the price must be appropriate in order for people to accept them as Xiaomi did⚙️
This guy waving a paper thin laptop around, I'm just waiting for disaster.
Please send me one that brand ahhhhh.... i need laptoo like that
Have seen Youtube videos describing these computers as a niche-market product. I do not agree. They should sell this product to schools, Universities  and companies. I mean, easy-to-repair computers like this are an IT-departments dream. If they can introduce this product such places, they could sell a lot more of them, then if they only market them to “tinkerers”.
Still the note 9, man is a legend.
I do not understand their purpose. They seem to be anti-Apple and anti-Microsoft gimmick. Many companies like MSI and Asus sell laptops which can be easily opened, repaired, and upgraded (as much as this laptop can). These companies void warranty when you open, but Framework allow you to open only. If it gets damaged during repair/upgrade or if you use parts which Framework do not provide then warranty is void. Basically you are tied to Framework if you buy their laptop, which isn't good. And in 3-4 years this laptop will be obsolete and you will require a new laptop anyways. CPU/GPU upgrades are not a thing and if you are replacing motherboard then why not replace whole laptop for a change. They have created cute tiny modules for ports and SSD but they are too small to get lost easily. We all know how many stuff we lose. And if even 2-3 people bring the same laptop to a meeting and put those tiny modules on a table then it will be a nightmare to figure out which belongs to whom. Personally I do not like their vision. As a laptop person I would prefer to have a laptop which I never need to open. I do not like opening my laptop to clean fans. I want a laptop which never gets dirty from inside and if I want to add RAM and storage then I would prefer to have option to choose which RAM and storage I want at the time of purchase. Companies lie all the time about the parts they use. If Framework should have focused on that vision where they have transparency in parts they use, it would have been really innovative and revolutionary. I would prefer that I know what parts companies are using at the time of purchase and better to have an option to choose which part I want.
Get it to India!!!!!!!!!!
SKeptical.   Watched the video. Now I am onboard.
$1000+ and no discrete GPU? Come on
This should be standard
Great!! Waiting for final products
Jeez I love that brand 😍
I want one so bad now but money and stuff
is the future can we see a framework touch laptop?
labeling like this should be necessary.
its nice to see a company that cares :)
I'm definitly buying this
I want one
but it’s literally ugly…
Do you think there will be a 15in model in the future with a changeable graphics card board? I would buy that in a heartbeat!
It's like the half-way project ARA, hope this don't get abandoned like project ARA. I like repairable/upgradable hardware.
Bought one.  Best computer ever purchased. Period.
I have one (admittedly really weird) gripe with the framework. Standard loadout comes with 4 USB-C modules. These are $9 each in the configuratior. Ok, reasonable.  But…  The modules connect via…  USB-C…  Wouldn’t it be a much better use of your money to get 4 other modules and if for whatever reason you need a USB-C connection just pull a module out and connect directly?
they should have used AMD instead of intel for this form factor.
I think most PC Hardware for office use actually does not really need an upgrade plan.  There has not really been a real growth in hardware requirements in more than a decade now.  You need to be able to switch out stuff that wears. like fans, SSDs or HDDs. Everything else should just be built to last. I have no problem with glued and soldered stuff.  As long as you are actually able to get the parts, you will find somebody who is able to repair it.
They're hiring? Awesome, if I lose my job here soon because of vaccine mandate, I will look into this. Very exciting.
2.1K Mac Fanboys dislike this video I assume XD
"Yes! If you ever need more performance in the future, you can upgrade to a new Mainboard with a new CPU on it. We publish step by step guides you can follow to do the upgrade yourself."
I love this but I'm using an old Dell latitude which I can swap out the hdd and battery in which still works super well. Hope this thing becomes cheaper
Just as a wise rick once said,   "Morty you looked into the eyes of capitalism and said yes daddy please"
2:57 Finally, brand collaboration 🧑‍🔬
Here's what I don't get, the expansion cards look like they use usb-c to plug in then why do I need usb-c cards, just take the card out and plug in the cable right?
Try making a small video on making custom Framework Modules, like magnetic charging etc, or put 2 items in their modules
No GPU? Only integrated ??
Great channel, Actually want to support you guys
This'll be my next machine.
YES! Finally, no excuses for getting sucked into some proprietary "eco system" where you don't own anything and you are paying thousands to be the product.
I mean I can commend them for what they're doing, but the big but, is there really a market for a product like this? Seems very niche. The average joe will never even open up their laptop and just buys a new laptop when they feel like their current isn't up to par, after some years of use, the laptop will have scuffs and dings on the shell and most likely obsolete form factor/tech, and so they won't want to swap in a new motherboard and other pieces.  Not to mention the other various laptop markets to think about, ultralight's and gaming laptop's have their shares as well. This product doesn't compete with them in anyway or form, this laptop is targeting the middle-ground aka the office laptop market, I'm saying that these people are not interested in a product like this. So that leaves us with a niche market of people who are high advocates of right to repair and opensource.
What's the point of this if you can just download a graphics card FOR FREE on the internet?
how hard for an ejectable battery?
🔨 nice nice
To be honest it looks very familiar to my Lenovo Flex-5 series. Only that they need 12 Screws and it is pretty serviceable, but of course not in the scale.
The biggest problem with this laptop is where they put the ports and the number of them. Only 4 and only on the sides. They could've put a few default ports on the rear or just made the laptop slightly bigger to accommodate more on the back, there's nothing worst than trying to bend a video cable, that should be on the back, extra USB ports on the back.
If the laptop would have a screen that can turn around and where i can write on, I would´ve bought one. Otherwise, I´m going to wait for a model that support such features
I’m a Mac user, with no reason nor intention to ever switch, but I want to buy a Framework laptop just to support them - right to repair is incredibly important and they’re not only empowering the movement but doing it in a very consumer friendly and attractive way!
Did he just nunchuk a laptop? 😆😆
that's cool
No gpu? Not fully customizable
11:34 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
they failed to make the battery hot swappable !! but great laptop I wish thinkpad  can do a laptop like this one :(
Yep, you can tell its all designed and manufactured by engineers
Damn. I just bought a laptop for 870$ and I just so happen to look at linus and find this gem GODDAMMIT
The idea is nice but for the moment they need to expand a 13,5 screen it's to small for most users 15,6 it's default for many, also no mentio of gpu  ...
this is what we want laptop companies should rlly be doing something like this.
Let's hope that this will become standard. Good for consumers and environment.
Can windows 11 work on this product?
OMG, I'M ONLY 4 MIN IN THE VIDEO AND I CANNOT BELIEVE MY EYES!!!! 💜💜💜💜
I was so excited until I found that the CPU is soldered inside the motherboard, and that it is an Intel CPU which has inferior iGPU. CPU is one of the devices that can be upgraded on most laptop, otherwise it is a great laptop.
That webcam is amazing!
So basically you can only change a drive and some I/O ports.
Try to sell in India
Can I get a double thicc one with at least 5 USB A ports?  Should also free up room for socketed CPU and GPU.
GPU heavy version would be great for gaming or CAD
ok
The Dell bit at 11:30 ish was perfectly edited and timed.   This is what keeps me coming back Linus, not your wise words of tech breakdowns... The subtle disses.
It doesn't deserve a 10 because the owners eat babies!
Give me a Wacom digitizer and I will buy this if mother boards are truly upgradable in the future.
I would order one if it had a widescreen option. I have to have it for work.
apple : should we glue and solder the screw also?
Now we need one with  a AMD CPU and Modular GPU for Gaming Please :D
Hey man, can you help me out. My onenote decided to fully delete all 10 of my college and personal notes. Onedrive was suppose to back all of the notes up because it is a cloud based service. I had my notes synced between my laptop and phone, so it was definitely on the cloud. But there are no onenote files or anything on the cloud or computer. Also Microsoft wouldn't help me because my situation isn't a tier 2 IT problem and they don't recover any personal data or files
I bought one of these just because of this video.  So far, it's a great laptop.
I wonder if people will actually upgrade their framework laptop or just buy the new model
Oh brother, if you still feel like this for over 4 hours, you're supposed to see a doctor immediately...
Where’s the link to buy ?
Damn, and I just bought a Dell, because it is relatively user-friendly machine. But it's quite interesting, that it's relatively low cost model and it has room for upgrades - free dimm slot, free 2,5" HDD slot, available service manual and it has USB-A, ethernet and Jack - why the XPS seems to be much less user friendly?
Hasn't Fujitsu or Toshiba done something like this?
im so glad i was watching linus vids before buying my new laptop
All definetly get this as my next laptop in like 4 years.
If y’all want this to succeed, buy their laptops!
I'll be keeping an eye on Framework. If they ever release a gaming version with a discrete GPU, I'd be all over that.
I'm probably gonna buy one if they ever include a dedicated GPU, for my workload.
how is this laptop for video editing?
This generally is cool as fuck and reminds me a lot of the Nokia 3310 phones that used to have changeable keyboards and housing :)
Oooo0000oooooO it even comes with a screwdriver !
i want a editing machine which can edit 8k footagge from fraame work with 16 vram yeah iam going overkill
yo im getting one
Now when you drop it will become lego
As someone who still daily drives a 2012 17” MacBook simply because I can swap drives out, upgrade ram, replace my battery, etc, this laptop is amazing.  It might actually push me to something other than MacOS.
I love u intro
Hold up, you save $300 if you assemble it yourself?  Tha sounds like a no brainer.  Holly frick, this is amazing, I hope they will be a successful business.
Another point about the longlevity at the end, even if we assume the laptop and its components will last for ever, then it still takes a lot of time to sell one to every household, in the developed world. And that is a low estimate of the size of the market. Add to that the fact that every year there are more and more new students who need a laptop. And it is save to say that they have the potential to be around for the long term.
OMG the perfect laptop
DAMN !
what about video cards ? gaming and so on . know its a start up but that info would have helped alot
Genius Project, finally a respectable upgradable modular Laptop!
I hope they make a TRANSPARENT ONE!
The reason it’ll never be successful in the long run is because unless his company stays in business forever you won’t be able to buy upgrades for it I mean you could probably source them out some of the components through the manufactures we’re trying to figure out what’s compatible and what’s not until big companies like Apple dell hp get on board with something like this it’ll never be main stream I think the idea is awesome but I think it’s also a gimmick right now
I'm sold
who was in paris
If Framework came up with a gaming-oriented design I would be all over it.
✅
I’m a Kid
Is the GPU upgradeable?
I really hope this works out but I’m apprehensive about adoption, but I can put that to one side.
Does Framework ship to Southeast Asia  or other East Asian Countries?  That's the question I have
This is impressive Ima keep up with frameworks. If we eventually get CPU and GPU that we could remove itd change the world of custom laptops... which doesnt exist yet
11:28  That is the face of a man running some quick maths to see if he can invest
I'm a Apple user through and through but this laptop makes me want one.
I'm a computer repair tech for a living and I am honestly considering buying one of these just to support them. The number of laptops I take apart every year and am disgusted by the design and lack of reparability makes this look beyond amazing to me. Calling out Dell as one of the WORST offenders of reparability and upgradability.
Remind me of "beyond brand" laptop, this brand also promise same idea, I suggest my friend to bought one, but can't hear any news about that brand anymore, kind of feel guilty, my bad But this one, look promising, hope I'm not wrong again
Apple spent billions per year to make sure they keep u in their endless ecosystem.
soo... is it possible to connect a proper gpu into this for gaming?
Do a video on the HP Victussssss
miku x framework laptop shell and 😈
I'm hoping so hard that when it is time for me to buy a new laptop, Framework will be available in my country and even better than it is now
the only complaint I can think of about the Framework laptop design is the IO. Sure you can swap them around, but if you're using USB C can't I have say TWO USB A ports on a single module, or a VGA port AND a LAN port, etc etc? I mean you only have 2 or 3 IO module slots. It's silly to limit each slot to a single item
This is the best news I've heard all year. I mean we've all been crying out for Dell to do exactly this because we know they can do it well. But frack it Framework just won the Nobel Peace Prize with this product. #TakeMyMoney
English!/
TAKE THAT APPLE !!!!
the price is insane, i would prefer asus with soldered ram for half of the price
I just hate the way he review the product just like a fucking hyped teenager from early 2000s. Time has changed and don't do it, seriously it is annoying. That's not you anyway.
what kind of mother board is in it
Having done a lot of IT work for schools/colleges (as a tech, both in house IT and working for a managed service provider) and seeing the huge cost differential between being able to self-repair a Lenovo laptop in our shop, vs how hard it is to replace a laptop HDD in a Dell... This thing has me salivating.  Targeting the high end niche is a good idea to get started. I hope they are able to make ruggedized versions down the line.  I can see why you invested.
omg i want it
Hey linus, have by chance done a dedicated 2.4 ghz setting video on mesh routers before?? Just curious
The moment this gets ARM based soc/cpu im am dunping my m1!
something that would be very interesting to see is to have the clear keyboard keys be able to be back lite in different colors so you can specify what keys were for what just like how most gamers will swap out there keys for color keys for quick understanding
its been long enough since I last watched a Linus Tech Tips video that the corny segue into the sponsor actually surprised me.
8:17 luckily you're not the support guy XD
I want to buy it.
Linus: "I wouldn't boot off of that one" Me: "I would definitely boot only off that and carry 20 of them with different OS, just for the lolz"
This Arab sounds just like Linus
Apple probably spends money on R&D to come up with designs to make sure the device can't be repaired.
I think there shouldn't be iphones as they are now without right to repair
YO THAT BATTERY DISCONNECT I NEED THAT SHIT FAM
What about a bigger version with an upgradeable GPU in the future?
So cool!
Is there a follow up video to this already going over any potential pitfalls/gotchas found by the community or is it a pretty rock solid product ? This is such a cool concept and should be applied to more of our devices/electronics everywhere. Phones, Industrial field equipment, medical equipment etc....
I would love to see a I/O plug that is an indented USB A so I can put my wireless mouse module so I stop breaking them
Little correction here: "The philosophical difference between..." isolating the end user from repair and planned obsolescence forcing them to buy a new one and building a laptop that can go the distance like a PC.... Priceless <3
9:05 So I've been nodding my head and thinking "This is purdy neat!"  At this point is when I litterally sat up and woke my ma shouting "HOLD UP. YOU CAN DO THAT NOW?!?"
This is the best laptop and business strategy I've ever seen and I wish I had money so I could buy one right now. This is amazing.
Amazing what engineers can do when not dealing with the boardroom....
Can't wait for them to come to Australia!
Yes, I'll definitely own 1 at some point. Just the modular-ness sold me.
Are they looking for an analytics/BI person?
this so dope laptop i want it
I wonder what would it take to integrate a power bank to each of these expandable slots so it would last for, say, 24 hours
do you plan on covering the MNT Reform?
I love this!
I don't have much money electronic devices are major purchases for me I am very interested in trying to buy something from these people because I could conceivably have it for a very long time that's a good thing
We all want this company to break the stereotypes of "planned obsolescence" and money grabbing big tech that actually work _against_ their consumers. And the best way to do this is buy them, recommend them, and if possible, invest in them! LG came out with G5 with modular design but it failed..let's make this work, people!
The only laptop I would buy new
I’m going to buy this.
this video sold more frameworks than they ever could have on a full year marketing project !
I hope this really blows up and makes it to every stores all over the world!!!
the lenovo thinkpad t410 has had at least one module you could change between an optical drive a battery or a storage expansion
Pretty cool how Framework is transparent to whatever manufacturing faults arise, at least with the DIY edition.
Adding lower end gpu's would sell me entirely. Since what I've noticed is that the cpu will be fine long after the igpu gives up.
Hehe if they can fit a separate gpu like the 30 series i will defiantly buy my next laptop from them.
The config with black bezels and black keys even looks like a MacBook!
All other brands are dead to me
truly excting to see a possible open system laptop.   I can see why you jumped to invest in it.... Still hate laptops tho :)
Bless you
Apple: Ight imma head out.
They solved my biggest laptop complaint-- upgradeability!
0:13 interesting what laptop is that??
This is actually why I''m leaving laptop land. Even though you can swap out ram and storage, they're just bound to age with time. And the portability is no longer important to me. About to build my own pc and never have that problem again.
Yesssss
Forget magnetic charging connector: Give me a inductive coupled wireless charger.
So Apples hiring?  Or did your video editor Miss Q that question? Lol
"They have gone out the their way to design the motherboard to be used outside the laptop, and provided the CAD drawings so you can build your own use" absolutely 10/10 I was just about to ask that. Incredible
Checked it out at Framework. Looks promising.
Consumer side is a good deal, TI or commercial is a nightmare ...
Imagine how cool it could be if they did a yearly, or monthly, drop of an artist's artwork over certain components. Basically, making collectibles to upgrade to and propping up independent artists!
but. DO THEY ACCEPT CRYPTO AS PAYMENTS???
That magnetic charging port you were talking about a channel called elevated systems is doing that rn
Without Windows they could make it even more affordable...
14:46 LOL 😆
I really want this company to succeed. In this day and age, we absolutely NEED upgradeable hardware! Thinkpads used to be the champions of durable and upgradeable laptops, but they've sold out and are involved in the same anti-consumer practices as other brands. I see no reason to support thinkpads any longer if they're just as bad as everyone else. It's time we give Lenovo a run for their money for abandoning the very thing that made thinkpads popular in the first place!  And I would also like to add that if Framework fails, other tech companies will point their fingers at them and say "told you so!", so I think it is CRUCIAL to support their cause!
It's like I'm watching a love story of Linus and Framework
awesome...seriously
oh my god, plz no, I can't buy this now, no money... ugh... credit card, creeping in hand... batch 5? fuck it
I'll laugh in 3 years when this product will either be discontinued or modularity will be irrelevant if new versions will use different connection types. Not to mention you will buy replacements only from them which could translate into jacked up prices.
"I'm sold" on the laptop or on the company?
They need 4K touch screens then I’m in
Activate Windows LOL
Get a PT-PT ISO keyboard and we'll talk xD
Make a gaming laptop!!!
They will come for you framework(you know who) buckle up and lets do this shit  Because i have a acer and a dell laptop from 2014 and i cant upgrade them
"I personally would love to see a touch option."  Just imagine.  They come out with the touch option.  And you can just... swap it in to the laptop you already have.  Because they're not assholes.
I’ve been searching for the perfect laptop for a while now and I think I’ve finally found it. This is a great sign for the computer industry.
My biggest wants from framework in a list from easy to difficult would probably be Color options Even more varied port options Windows facial recognition  AMD dGPU
Not only a great video and product, but a great sponsor too!
I remember that when this video release their site just DDOS by this viewers.
Can't wait for a Ryzen version <3   Love this video too, such a passionate man Linus is, about the things that matter
Of all the things this laptop does right, the biggest one for me is that is the best webcam I have ever seen on a laptop
This is great! I will buy and recommend them when it will be available in Europe.
good idea but the prices are way too high - and i've configured the cheapest diy and pre-assembled one... the DIY is more expensive...
Framework doing partnerships to make specific upgrades is suh a good idea. Imagine a partnerships with Wacom and creates a touchscreen that support pen pressure and suddenly your Framework laptop is also a drawing tablet. This is brilliant!
I used a Purism Librem laptop for a bit more than a year, and let me tell you that, even though their laptop is made from open source components etc, it's nowhere as upgradable as this one. I had to mill the keyboard's plastic stumps behind the motherboard just to replace the damn thing, and Purism wouldn't even sell me a new keyboard!!
Well, I am intrigued now. Only issue is since it's not mainstream yet, might find issues with servicing etc.
This is bananas, holy crap, amazing.
Apple please note .
Will they be doing UK specs? UK keyboard and AC adapter?
Didn't hear any mention of a ethernet port slot card.
ALL COMPANIES SHOULD BE DOMINATED BY ENGINEERS WHO ARE TRYING TO BUILD THE BEST PRODUCT POSSIBLE NOT SCREW OVER THE CUSTOMER!!!
You know a company is under staffed when they put “we’re hiring” printed inside their products.
If this laptop is 100% everything it seems to be, we need to support the shit out of them so this can be our future. And then... Get them to create a Framework phone!
Want one! But they don't ship to me yet :'(
I'm thinking, the main challenge of Framework would be to supply all of these parts or compatible parts for years. Will I be able to put a fresh CPU with motherboard in the same enclosure in 10 years from now?  All those slots are not very expandable. The true expansion cards work over the motherboard bus (ISA/PCI/PCI express, etc.). But those cards work with USB controller.  And there is the limit to the size of that card.  But that's not bad first step, but still far from old laptops upgradability. Looks like engineers sacrificed some features against cool thin tiny look.
That is worse than my Asus ROG G53S laptop. I do have: - fully upgradable CPU. Currently I'm using i7-2670QM and I can replace it if it dies. - fully upgradable GPU. I don't know the exact pinout and atandart, but I can buy any of a lot options for replacement. - insanely cheap motherboard. Once I replaced it and it cost me only $50 with shipping. Of course, I do have 3 (or even 4?) slots for RAM. And, the best - 2 places for 5.25 drives + optical drive (or space for the 3rd drive). Oh, and cooling. There are 2 separate fans, radiators and awesome airflow. It blows air to the back, so I can work in bed, for example, and not to clog the airflow  Unfortunately, it's about 10 years old and I can't easily find, at least, a couple of parts for it to replace (USB+SD card extension board and internal webcam cord).
we re entering old toshiba levels of quality
I take notes digitally with a pen on a convertible. If they will release it as a convertible, Im sold
I had a laptop with a CPU socket - almost 10 years ago though
When they collab with AMD im in. Also wish theyd include mobile gpus. Its a really impressive start and im glad you did a video on it
Going to keep an eye on them....as soon as a Ryzen variant is available, I'm in.
Coreboot
“Now I wanna invest” And he actually did
“The dell isn’t even thinner” yes, the framework is great. But the XPS 15 has (or can have) a dedicated GPU, needs much more cooling, and has a battery 50% larger. At least my model from 2017 did.
I really hope this company succeeds. I have been waiting for customizable laptops to catch up to desktop options for a while. Fantastic. This might be the next laptop I buy
That's my kind of laptop ! Switch & Swap.
I just bought an Asus Rog Zephyrus with a 3070, but... I think I might buy this for my ma so she has a nice laptop and I'll be investing into a company that really needs to succeed.
It would be great to add external GPU support and extension card for mining rigs
the battery disconnect is the best feature, my (terrible) laptop has like a 30 min battery life because i always run it off the wall. so that feature would be extremely useful
I was really impressed by the transparent keyboard and the battery switch setting Holy fuck, I can t wait to see what's coming next 👌
Is this the real life?  Is this just fantasy?
best developer machine, I hope focus for linux support with hardware becomes solid!!
I really hope in like 15 years, 10:45 will be in some tech history archive.
It should be even for smartphones and gaming consoles too. Just imagine how much impact for environment will be reduced!
Actualy more manufacturers are soldering ram, Lenovo did it on the Lenovo Flex 5 2020 model
The bloody tendency controversly work because carriage italy punish versus a hulking fear. puzzling, fragile libra
Can I detach the mic and webcam and leave it without that and the bezel look ok?
11:52, Confirmed! Linus is a robot and had a kernel panic just then.
Finally we have an hardware manufacturer that is fair, transparent and bulid upgradeable laptops. I will order it immediately when they will open sales of this devices in EU. Im 1000 % convinced and sure.
My very first PC UP grade was on an ASUS G20 or 60 "G" 'micro' desk top which used a laptop mobo, in a tiny little case. Which I installed some RIPJAW ram and 1060RTG :)
^crys ...
This actually makes me so happy - I'm so used to seeing all this manipulation and greed from these massive tech companies, that this just seems so unreal? There are people who have a vision for a laptop which you can upgrade to your liking, without paying thousands or socially manipulating the market. Like this is so brilliant, I really really REALLy hope they succeed because humanity needs a win right now.
The broken phone tho....
Hmmm it's weird how this is the first video that shows up when you enter the channel. I'm sure there's a non bias or interest driven reason to that!
what happened at 11:53
Pshhhh Linus probably has a stake in this company!
I think my only "complaint" so far is that they don't have a version with a number pad on the keyboard.  Once that comes around I am 100% on board with buying one of these bad boys.
The childlike tongue bodily lighten because wax partly kick to a cloudy maraca. neat, vacuous damage
_looks at my mac book pro_  "I dont want you anymore!!"
*breath in* YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSS!!!! FINALY!!!! Just like upgrading a car in NFS game
I'm buying one for my kid. My daughter better know how to work on computers as that's how we survived when she was newly born
Will they offer a 360⁰ hinge? Does it have an ethernet port?  Is there a compatibility or bottleneck from using a USB interface for modular additions?
NICE
Hope they wont be bought by some other big company that buries the project. because it would be less $ for their company.
Somehow reminds me of the battery/floppy/cd/charger slot exchange of Siemens Scenic Mobile, just for way more parts. Can you change things on the fly?
8:50 I mean they had my full support already but damn!
US and Canada only. Shipping to third world countries like Poland probably never going to happen :(
Excellent, there on the right track with the internal components, however would appear the modular bays are just 4 usb c connections in a recess.  Ideally I would want to be able to upgrade the GPU and don’t think usb c would be fast enough. Be great if they released a larger gaming model with a pci express bay, then developed a upgrade cartridge with different mobile GPUs.
Me wondering why my 2yo MacBook Pro is slow af
Does it game tho?
what i  don' like  is  charging  over  type C
after all  this is personal  laptop  , not like  lenovo legion   , and  others   ,  and i  like  it  ...
just  put sticker  over  modular conection  , is more secure  ,and ther is no bump ...
On the strength of this video and your followup (investor) video I went to order.  Unfortunately Australia is not on the list of countries that can order yet.
I have just one question: Does ist have ALL the status LEDs?  Like wireless activity & state, battery state, ssd activity, mute (microphone and speakers),...?
Giddamit - always someone trying to rip the guts out of the second hand market.
I don't really need a laptop, still I want to own one of these.
add a trackpoint like thingy and i'm buying it right now.
Someone should design a GPU connector so that the laptops could have modular GPUs.  It's been proven that thunderbolt connectors could feasibley handle it.
4:18 i thought linus was playing an optical illusion the way he held the laptop
13:39 I don't care about touch, and I'm *less* likely to buy a laptop if it *has* touch then if it does not even with equal price. However I'd like a *way* better screen then the one included. And preferably also a better keyboard, speaker, camera and microphone. And of course a non-Intel CPU.
Great concept for ease of repair. How about upgradable logic boards like clones used to be ie 8088 /286 /386 /486 and custom video.  Multi ports within each plug in port and  a magnetic disconnect power just like my Fry Daddy from the 1970s built into the case
So can you put in another motherboard with a new CPU in it when you remove the old one?
It's so funny how he was yelling at Dell. "Where's my Type-A port Dell?!" "The Dell's not even f***ing thinner!"
what i do to my speaker and headphone jack when it broke on my asus laptop? i remove it. my laptop become lighter. 🤣
I was postponing replacimg my 8-year old Acer, which aside from battery needing replacement is still doing its job well. This might be the laptop that makes me do the upgrade. More companies should go this way.
Those expansion slots look wide enough for 2 usb-c ports. If so, the usb-c module probably should've had two. I don't know of many situations where a built-in hub would be an issue. If not, then the expansion slot size was chosen pretty poorly.  A lot of laptop motherboards have angled ram slots that let the ram modules overlap, using much less horizontal space for a little more vertical space. Feels like there was a missed opportunity to have a higher ram capacity and to be able to cobble together many small modules that a DIY-er might have laying around.
I commend the idea, but I myself am amazed how many people only want end product that's tightly designed, and NEVER want to open up laptops/gadgets and try to fix it when they have problems, because they see it as adding problem to their life.  Not to add that most are computer illiterate (maybe not computer-illiterate, more like just want fast simple solution, instead of trying to fix things). When they have a problem, like, a laptop that's slow, they never want to clean their files, instead just blame the laptop maker, and just want to buy a new one and throw the old one away.  This is why Apple product is so popular, because they are just that, a simple, tightly designed product that just work, and I fear that this framework idea isnt gonna go well because of that.
Only thing stopping me from getting one is the small 13 inch display. Hopefully they bring in a 15 inch soon.
When my current laptop (surface laptop) gets unusable, I will buy one. Amazing product.
Without a good dedicated GPU this seems kind of useless. I don't care about ports that much. What I want is a customizable gaming laptop, I don't care if it's very thick.
I've been watching these guys since I first heard of them, being in the UK though limits my access...
I can see this being the darling for businesses that have an IT department and need laptops
I want one! If I hadn't literally just upgraded my laptop 2 mos ago I'd buy one.
So, no GPU is available now for this laptop. It sucks.
11:53 is legit a feverdream xd
Correction (please like this so more people see): It's not USB 3.2, the Type-C ports are USB4 (yes, *the* USB4, you know, the one that has eGPU support)
What an amazing product 😍 If only I needed a laptop, I would get this one. Maybe when it's time to upgrade, and they release an external GPU box for this one?
My old HP Pavillion 17in had a PGA socketable CPU, and I was even able to upgrade my i5 to an i7. There was no IHS, so it cant really say that the CPU took all that much more space then a soldered one. Bring that back plwase?
You being hyped about this laptop hypes me up too... thanks for the showcase UwU
those excuses have NEVER held up...
and no bloatware.
Num pad version and I would legitimately buy one when I replace my current laptop
who needs a touchscreen on a laptop? i‘ve had one for the past 9 years and have hardly ever found it useful.
We can finally build the terminal from Don't Touch Anything
5:06 the definition of an inside job…
This is the way they should all be built.  Way back whenn.. I bought the sager ( alienware, falconware) laptop. It was a beast but fully buildable.  Whe. This gets touch.. I will def be ordering. The right guy to be backing this product. Following you since your start.
ngl, this video made me take the plunge. I ordered one. It arrives in 7 days. Thanks Linus!
This reminds me of the modular phone that was getting attention before Google bought it and never spoke another word about it. Hopefully the Framework team doesn’t fall for the same trick.
@Framework, all you have to do is stick on decent stylus compatible screen and I'll give you $2,500 for that device right now. No joke.
Looking forward to a Ryzen version.  Thunderbolt to support external GPUs would seal the deal today!
In response to your 'why have clips when you can have magnets....'  I blame magnetic bits in laptops and keyboard hand rests for at least 3 destroyed credit card strips.  thankfully that is really not an issue anymore since the U.S. is finally out of the dark ages and uses chips now.  Only about 10 years behind the rest of the developed world, who have all been nfid for awhile now.
I am not even in the market for a laptop and I want one of these.  I have not gotten to the screen part yet.  I hope it has a touchscreen option, as that is a dealbreaker for me to not have in a laptop.  I don't even use it that much, but when I want to use it, it needs to be there.
Asus are now ripping off their customers, they claim certain laptops are HDD upgradeable for example the Vivobook M451 even boasts about it in their product Overview Only one small downside to this, what you may ask? Asus have removed the Gasket - Cable and Mylar and you have to purchase them separately, of which none of this is stated in their product overview in fact it's only when you go to fit the HDD you quickly realise there is nothing to fit too??????? what makes this even more funnier is that Asus in fact no one has the parts. Absolute scam. Asus's reason for not supplying these parts were, people may throw them away and not recycle causing harm to the environment????????????????????????????????
finally
"WHERE'S MY TYPE A PORT? THE DELL'S NOT EVEN F&$#@ING THINNER!" 😂  I know it's an integrated unit, but this is exactly why I stand by my LG Gram. Way more portable and STILL HAS FULL SIZE USB AND HDMI for days! It's like taking away headphone jacks on phones. It's an arbitrary and annoying dictation.
Now imagine a touch/stylus screen and the ability to be used as a desktop screen
I feel like this could propel a lot of people into the diy pc building world
Check the dell precision m3800. It also has easy access for upgrating the device
I really hope framework are successful enough to start shipping in UK... If they build one with an ISO keyboard, I'll buy one instantly.
LOL only 2k Dell's 3k employees dislike this vide0.
I'd buy one.
The modular doodad thingamejigs... I love the technical jargon. I like the sound and look of this laptop.
Oops... I thought you said 'Cheese kill.'
Is that a galaxy note 9 in 2021?
I would like Linus to cry a river
If they do IPO. I am buying
I bet this bad boy runs Linux like a champ.... I WANT ONE! I SOOOOOOO BADLY WANT ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This thing is AWESOME! PLEASE SELL IT IN THE UK!!!!!
this is the best
Okay, I bought one. Arrived yesterday.  Very impressed and have no regrets.  I just hope they are still around in 5 years.
The abortive soccer neatly develop because recorder biosynthetically squeal during a living battery. questionable,  fresh gauge
Magnetic charging port DIY done already https://youtu.be/0_uOzNt-xwY
But where's my discrete GPU?  If they offer a model in the future that has a place for one, I'm sold.
Looks at frame.work site -> Oh, AMD does not exist. wow ok.
Now thats what we call *user friendly*
8:36 ~ 8:43 Bullshit. 100%. Look up the Samsung RV411 laptop, for instance. You can swap and drop in a new CPU without any soldering whatsoever, and it's a laptop.
This is awesome!  Thank you to @Louis Rossman for pointing out your investment video.
ordering 2 of these badboys right NOW!
Clearly Linus is trying to sell you this!!!!! I'm a Detective!
Damn ... I'm going to make sure this is the daily driver in our company!
So it has the usb dongle built in?
i'll take a hello kitty keyboard, pls
10:44
I want this with MACos
9:27  I realized that Linus put the wifi cable in the wrong way lol (notice the triangle color code)
I LOVE THIS
We have the software Linus in charge of Linux, but now that Linus from LTT has invested into Framework, we also have _the hardware Linus,_ making a computer that is pretty much _the hardware Linux_
hey, theres a micro center near where i live lol
epic
This is so sweet. I love this approach. Hope they succeed!
"I like this. dont get me wrong, this is good but i like this"
I wish I found out about this laptop at the beginning of the summer when I purchased a new one...
I didnt say anything..... 😁😂
This is my next computer
9:15 framework puts the color coding for the cable right on the card; linus still plugs it in the wrong one.
I kinda hope they built in a passthrough connector to the screen so when they release a touch digitizer you can just take off the front bezel and just pop it into place.
Im buying one when my current laptop dies.
Never seen Linus this happy
11:57 im crying XDDDDDDD
I have a question about the charger. It has been a few hours science I mailed the Support team of Framework, but I cant wait because I need to buy the laptop in USA and send it to Argentina (it's my actual residence country). The charger only supports an input of 120/140 volts or supports 220/240 volts? @Linus Tech Tips
Man i know the Pain, how much it hurts when your laptop becomes useless cuz of Single F*cking Part Damage. Framework is doin such a great Job!
11:45 I'm FUCKING crying
Fuck the size man! Why care how thick and heavy it is, the more powerful it is. I mean it is a tool, not a jewelry, right??😎😎
In regards to solid rigidity despite being really thin. It's all about profiling, bracing and anchoring. This is how we can make a platform you can walk and jump on with barely any flex, using sheet metal not much thicker than a few layers of aluminium foil. You can do a lot of it with plastics too, but sandwich and anchor some pretty thin polycarbonate or nylon with thin steel - you got yourself some serious wizardry.
NOBODY WANTS TOUCH SUPPORT. JUST STOP.
Pops together like a little LEGO
1:38 😂 wooh hoo hoo 😅 Almost did a downgrade
you mentioned linus about throwing in that fat 1TB module for steam but when customising the laptop theres no options for GPUs on frameworks website
Shouldn't you do a metrics video?
Nice !
9:05 Wait what... THAT IS A THING?!?! 9:30 LINUS, THE ARROWS, BLACK TO BLACK, WHITE TO WHITE, NOOOOOOoooo... :( 17:25 Activate Windows, my dude.
Could be interesting prospect for small computer shops. Being able to buy parts from framework. Then being able to have their workshop techs preconfigure machines based on customer demand rather then having to buy machines based on the whims of various hardware manufacturers.   The repair angle is also nice. Since often an unrepairable laptop can loose a small computer shop money if they come in. Although considering the PCs that sell in my area. I'm excited for when they can start offering budget components.  Celerons or Pentiums to be exact.
Love this video
I'll buy one with a Ryzen CPU as soon as they become available. Immediately and without question.
RISC-V in the future, the Linux Community is going to love that.
"Someone can come along and design a magnetic charger and mimic it."   Yeah, someone did. AND he also designed an enclosure for his mouse radio.
This is the future of laptops. Hands down, the modular design means there is no upper limit for what you can do to this thing.
Honestly so over my Dell laptop after the Dell repair center did a number on my laptop, the next computer repair shop I sent it too even called me up complaining of how shitty of a job they did with the repair(btw when I got it back from the Dell repair center, it came back with more problems then I originally had, which was I just needed a charging port replaced), they didn't even seat the ssd correctly according to the other repair shop. And the keyboard is no longer working right anymore and it's not a driver issue, and a replacement part from my research is basically unobtainable unless your a certified Dell repair technician and get it straight from dell for a stupid amount of money or pay even more to buy a broken version of the same model laptop and hope it has a working keyboard; definitely gonna consider these guys for my next laptop, hopefully they can come with/work with Nvidia graphics so I can run my simulation software on it
This is amazing. I hope they will produce a 2 in 1 Laptop with pen/digitizer support in the future.  If that happens I will order immediately.
I definitely love this whole idea a lot, but I want to see this kind of idea on a tablet. I always prefer tablet over a laptop for being much lighter and smaller to bring everywhere.
and now linus is a shareholder in framework lol
Can't the USB C expansion have two USB C connectors on it? Is there enough space? That would be nice.
10:45 someone was foreshadowing 😂
I love it, I’ll buy one when they get some gpus in there
Damn this thing is gonna really piss off alot of companies because its such a great product
Framework should work with dbrand to customize the looks also :)
If I'm ever buying a laptop, it's gonna be Framework, for the ideal.
15:28 How about the Volta Spark, it does support 60W
This is what I imagine when I think of a futuristic device. Not disposable fashion statements!
I suddenly hate every other laptop.
This is magnificent. I love this. CPU/GPU upgrades when, though? Unironically, I want a laptop which can handle MX style switches. The keyboards in laptops are grossss.
They need to make changes to the logo though
I will buy one of these if I can get a zen lapto
we need an anlienware x17 r1 review linus bruuuh!
Now they just gotta make a gaming laptop
Could it be possible for chipmakers like Intel or AMD to make special thin laptop CPUs that slot in with their own connecter, like M.2?? Just a thought 🤔
Linus being sold, has me sold. The moment it is available in Australia, I will be buying it. If I had the capital, I'd invest as well. If Framework fails, then the other manufacturers will say "I told you so", we cannot let that happen. If Framework succeeds it puts the "but it isn't economically viable" argument to bed.
"Man, I sure wish I had a full sized Display Port Port"  Yo dawg, I heard you like ports....
loved it. now this is innovation. not removing the headphone jack from phones :p
Looking to invest too if they ever go public~
This is so refreshing... I sincerely hope that this company succeeds.
framework HYPE
Looks great, love the recycling ethos, will consider ordering once available here. Some ideas for future development... amd apu, two nvm storage sockets, more plug in modules inc double sockets eg usb, externally accessable battery (although the disconnect option makes this less of an issue), a dock feature, and personally im excited for a larger display model, 144hz display with touch (ideally up to 4k), a keyboard with number pad, prebuilt linux/windows options. A discrete gpu option would also be great, maybe by exposing pcie lanes for an add on card
The incandescent steel preauricularly explode because argentina encouragingly pray out a cheap dictionary. volatile, boorish peak
I'd love to get one, but since theres no German Keyboard Layout that won't happen sadly.   Framework, please add different keyboard layouts, thank you.
All this upgradeability and not even having 6 USBC ports. 1 power + 1 keyboard + 1 mouse + 2 monitors + 1 for other stuff = 6. Such a design fail.
once there was a concept of a peculiar phone...  Something to love over some time.  Unavailable outside n.America
I want one so bad, but I'm not in the market for a laptop. I'm looking for a 2 in 1 right now, but I almost want to buy a framework laptop just so there's a higher chance of me being able to buy a 2 in 1 from them in the future.
I'm wondering why you didn't casually disclose you are an investor in this company from this video.
YOU CAN RUN OFF OF WALL POWER?!?!?! YOOOOOOOOOOOO
Linus: “I wanna invest!” Linus Today: “ok so I invested…”
Linus was like “I’m not investing unless it has a huge touchpad”
The camera is sick
For me, Framework needs to do three things to make me buy one on the spot. 1: Different layouts. I might be weird that way, but I don't use a US layout. That one is lowest priority though. 2: I am actually avoiding Intel CPUs. Please let me have an AMD CPU or even an APU in my laptop. Intel is getting enough money from Apple and other companies that avoid AMD for no reason. And 3: Start shipping to Europe already!
"I want to invest"  - And then he did.
I need to know if my Steam games will run on it so I can cancel my Steam Deck reservation! (  JK... I'm not canceling it, but I'm intrigued by this product and may buy it also.
A great video and laptop  but....  this is aimed at the geeky people out there.  The average laptop buyer won't be interested in this as you have to open it up  to put the parts in, my wife is one of those  who just buys an item and expects it to go.  ps.  you showed us the 5 screws to remove and open it up  but how hard was it to removed the top??
AMD CPU/GPUs and a Clear Bezel / keyboard mount options and I would be sold. Want to be able to see that beautiful modularity :p
This laptop sounds like someone took a note everytime I thought "why don't they do a laptop that..." and made a company out of it.
When they have Ryzen stuff and a proper discrete GPU I'll look into it.
Anything that I can't remotely fix is just crap that I won't buy. I didn't have a laptop for that reason. Same goes for phones. I hate to use my phone, because it's just not customizable.  I may have found a laptop that I will buy (depending if my reason to buy one develops).
10:45 "Now I want to invest" Narrator:  And that's exactly what he did.
Went here following your investor video. Awesome product. Can't wait to buy one but absolutely need a touch panel with a more than 180degree option. I would have liked to invest also, don't have a 225k available like you, but still.
We need a future gaming customizable monster of a laptop and maybe with customizable RGB lol  My perfect gaming laptop would have a a big 17" 4k high nit OLED display with HDR and/or Dolby Vision ( I know wishful thinking) as I would use it a media center half of the time. A second display next to the keyboard it's so useful.  Top facing quality speakers.  DAC or better yet a Quad DAC audio headphones/aux output Latest Bluetooth with LDAC etc
Death to the Apple Genius desk!!
finally, I can get rid of one more prebuilt from my life. next stop phones.
Does anyone know if the laptop can support touchscreen input to be used as a tablet as well? Or is it too far ahead to assume?
I want one, wish i had the money to buy one myself, this is so COOL!!!
I see why he invested in framework, they seem to fit together perfectly.
I don't need a new laptop, but I'm thinking of buying one just to support them
This sound awesome would have bought one but I already have a HP envy and it is not good for the environment to switch that out just because there is an other device that would be better for the environment but if I will have to buy a new one I will definitely have a look at them because I love their approach
Who is here after the investment video?
gimme mini pcie 16x for egpu adapters and ryzen cpu and let me somehow attach a external extra cooler on the outside when i use it as desktop
In the company business space, this could be a game changer for business' to save a a fair % on laptop repair and management.  Too many times i see laptops thrown away to be replaced for a like-for-like (still usually underpowered and "just makes the mark" grade) only for the employee to hit the same problem again all too soon.   The over head alone (and other contractual costs) on fees to cycle laptops for repair by contract could save companies $$$ £££ in the long run.  The right to repair move isn't just for personal users to benefit, but even big time businesses having to supply, maintain and repair hundreds if not thousands of units. This is brilliant to see!
This is awesome wish I could buy one
This is a company that actually makes me smile. It's genuinely cute in a way.
No grafic cards?
I choose to use wired devices only, no battery!
THE FINGER PRINT HAS LINUX DRIVERS. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY ALREADY
good luck with the investment
Laptop + crocs business model, sounds good
Linus’s point about the magnetic charging port brings up even more ideas. If this were to get third party support and a bunch of different modules it could really be something special. I like what framework is doing, I may look into getting one of these at some point.
Stonks
Just rewatching after the newest Framework vid because I am so excited about this big step for right to repair
11:56  What a wonderful image and noise to go along with it
Linus actually invested in the company! he dropped an amazing video about it with a lot of clarity!
This makes me so happy! I hope they make a phone.
Unfortunately, not available in EU yet! Not sure if they can ship from US to Europe tho? How about the taxes?
My old 2008 MacBook Pro could be opened no problem (the battery compartment didn't even use screws). I regularly opened it up for cleaning, replaced the fans and the battery a few times and this laptop still lives today. Massive I-O also. Since that model it went downhill for Apple hard! I am so glad, that framework upholds these principles. I already lost hope that any company would allow for basic repairs.  Love you guys, framework 💙
What about dedicated graphics?
11:34 im dead lmfao
Camera is better than my legion 7 with cost me 4000usd
I hope they make a gaming version
1:38 now thats what i call a close call
5:57 - Framework actually advertises you can boot of those storage drives. Just go their site, configure a DIY laptop and when you get to the 1TB storage modules, click the i.
I lowkey love that that laptop has a credits module, thats charming AF.
I love every thing about this video except your hair.  Go invest in a Salon boi!
I just realized that it would also be great for privacy because you could remove the camera/microphone when they aren't needed :D
"And then he invested"
Wil this be usful for video edeting on Adobe or Resolve?
10:45 where it all began
Wow, this Framework laptop seems really good and eco-friendly, maybe Linus should invest in it or something
I sincerely hope Framework succeeds. I'm not in the market for a laptop ATM (just got an Envy X360 15 with the Ryzen), but if Framework lives on then I'll go to them in the future.
9:25 Completely misses the black/white colour coding for for the WiFi antennae
Y'all should make your own expansion cards and sell them on  the LTT store.  I wouldn't mind having an expansion card that hides my wireless mouse's USB-A antenna.
THE FUTURE IS HERE!
I'm SOLD!
Toss in motherboard options with a proper graphics chip and I'm sold.
In case anyone was wondering, and maybe like me could not find the information anywhere Hit Fn+spacebar to activate the backlit keyboard.3 levels of brightnes hope this helps someone
Wait, Linus watches anime!!??
compared to any other laptop.... this is still more upgradable and fixable compared to literally any other laptops XP Like, for Macbooks, you could never upgrade or fix anything, like if the storage fails... Can't get a new SSD. If the wifi doesn't work on it anymore, can't replace it, and you'll have to get a new MacBook. Anything could go wrong on a MacBook, and you couldn't do anything besides ask apple to repair it, and if they can't.... rip. meanwhile for typical laptops (intel or AMD etc) those have replaceable storage, and you can upgrade the ram a fair amount. Really, this current version holds up pretty well for upgrading and fixing broken parts. hopefully soon, we will have the ability to change anything within the device. Like, if I got the device with an i3, I could eventually upgrade it to an i7 or i9 when I have the money, or even I could replace the fans in the device, for better more efficient cooling ones. I doubt we'll get replaceable motherboards with these systems, as it might be a bit much. But who knows. Maybe intel will stop changing their stupid CPU sockets every other minute, so then a 3 year old CPU can be replaced by a better recent CPU, and have the shared socket intel01 instead of e621 and 42069 :S Also hopefully they provide more port upgrades, even allowing thunderbolt display :P
wow, the sponsorship is literally soo short, I can press the L key to skip it entirely XP lol
Looks cool and all, but I don't get why he got all excited about the price. This is not cheap. A mid-range configuration easily goes above 1k USD once you add all the essentials. And there's not even a decent GPU.
Is there a graphics card in this thing? (dont get me wrong, i absolutely love it, but i need dedicated graphics)
Just one word: "BEAUTIFUL" If I had watch this video before changing from device i will have bought it.
plot twist....the screen isn't supposed to open that far
Aww I love how happy fellow nerds get at spending a grand on a new thing but how exciting we are to get a free neat tool.
The "yeah cry me a river Linus" got me Lmfao
"Battery disconnect!" Need this for long sessions in Traktor.
9:15, linus plugged the wifi antenna the wrong way around, the arrows are black and white for a reason
IF anyone on here knows the company that made the power button PLEASE PLEASE SEND ME A LINK or a proper spelling I looked up goodx but can't find anything. I NEED THAT BUTTON for project I've been working on for a few years.
External gpu build ?
Too bad they don't have an AMD APU option. I don't game a ton on my laptop but it does happen occasionally.
My 2019 15" ideapad (not so high tech) is literally half empty inside without the battery.
This is the product that Google couldn't do, but framework? >:)
If you are interrested in this you should also check out the Fairphone, it has similar concept
this is how EVERY laptop should be
well, they should do a thicker version like the Alienware laptops, 'cause just those 3 slots are just too little.
I would any day pay for a laptop like this than any other laptop out there.
I appreciate how the internals are visibly designed by Apple engineers lmao. The display hinge seems a little sus though…hoping that the mechanicals can be improved just a touch for the next generation! A little more rigidity would be nice.
9:28 I'm pretty sure you just put the antenna cables on the wrong connections.  Typically the black cable goes to the black arrow, while the white cable goes to the white arrow.
This is completely random but is yur name actually Linus? Just wondering cuz its so close to Linux lol
Thank you. This is my new brand!
Need a touchscreen display but other than that, this is very impressive.
God this is such an amazing concept. I was going to try making it myself, so its mixed emotions lol. I'm selfishly sad but at the same time happy that others are actually innovating. I would love to work as their hardware engineer, but I'm still a student :(
Sexy-Thin: How does a "thin" laptop work better than a thicker one?
Answer, No it's not fully upgradable.
Take my money!!
Wow, this reminds me of my well loved Siemens Mobile 510 Laptop. It was fully modular. One could use disc drive, floppy, Batterie and power Rick inside or external. I even upgraded to CPU from a PII 233 MHz to a P3 360 MHz. Heck, the case was GREEN and indestructible. Would have bought next gen without any hesitation but Siemens stopped to build them.
This will definitely be my next laptop. Big middle finger to Apple.
I mean, old thinkpads up to the 2014 model I think are fully user upgradeable, CPU, ram, screen, keyboard, etc. The only thing that you can't really touch is the external I/o.
I'm going to say a prayer each morning that this company succeeds. What a marvelous concept!
0:20 holy shit, linus sounds like nardwuar
Wow, cars up next I hope.
evil 🍎 gonna kill world someday..
now I wait for my modern elite book type laptop
Does microcenter sell framework?
I'm super interested in what Framework are doing, but until I can get a laptop with AMD or nVidia graphics, I won't be buying. Intel graphics are leaps and bounds better than the old days, but *still* completely trash compared to their competition...
why do your videos play at 30FPS, like whats the point of recoding 4k or even 1440P if its 30FPS bing back fps over res
This is what happens when you have engineers do what they do best without interference from like a marketing team or bosses that want to cut corners and save money.
now we need one that we can add a graphics card pleeeease
Wired mouse gang
lol you put the wifi card cables in the wrong spots, if you look close there are colored indicators just below the terminals.
Valorant is top!
wow, if they get european/nordic keyboard layouts, ill buy this in a heartbeat!
sound like Proprietary components  but it's better to buy a single Propriety component,,  than buy Whole Propriety Laptop just cuz a single component break
MAN, I wish I saw this before I bought laptops for my kids schoolwork :(
shame they don't over a german keyboard layout or charger :I hope this succeeds!
I love this but call me when they have been in business for 10 years. I know that's a catch-22 type of situation but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I'm definitely interested and would like to see them use it in there videos.
Linus, the battery disconnect option in the BIOS is not only for disabling the battery when you are using wall power, it is also for easily servicing the insides of the laptop without disconnecting the battery. This feature is there in some present laptops, and since this laptop is made for modularity, it only makes sense for them to add the option in the BIOS.
Wowwww I thought this was gonna be like 3 grand, nice job. I hope they make LOTS of money.
I don't need one of these anymore, but I'd love to invest in this company if it goes public
Jeezuzz get off the coke already.
I don't need a laptop but I almost ordered one. I love the concept, the multitude of info / qr codes and all the detail. I did sign up to know when they start shipping to Germany. Only thing I would be worried about whether the little extensions hold strong enough, or they may become a bit loose (not sure if explaining it correctly) with time and stop making contact. Like maybe 2 years down the line I can't use my usb or something properly because that connector has become loose. I would also love some nice Amd cpus. Lately I am reading about interesting concepts, like the Fairphone for example (kinda crappy and expensive but also great idea). If only big companies started making things this way and spent a billion into proper r&d we would be so much better off. I know there's a lot of financial motivation against all this but maybe something will change in the next few years.
Call me when they have GPU options, and a reasonable price point. ~1100USD for my base needs on a 13.5" screen and no GPU is not great.  Also, what exactly are the storage expansion cards? The prices on them are comparable to the WD Black SN750 SSDs they offer, I think the only concern would be cooling them if they're doing a lot of read/write operations, and of course they are slower than the M.2 options, but still SIGNIFICANTLY faster than an HDD. I assume it's an SSD solution, despite the performance being much lower than similarly priced M.2 products.
wouldn't surprise me if they make motherboard/cpu drop ins down the line as an upgrade. i guess cooling might play a role.
"THE DELL'S NOT EVEN FUCKING THINNER!" LMAOOOO
Seems like you dropped your Note Linus. 😂😅
Apple Patent Police! Open up! 😁
Wish that it will also available soon in my region.
Just to put this out there:  If this company grows enough, then God knows what kinds of upgrades and options can become possible in the future. I'm hoping for a touchscreen and will be buying this laptop with the hopes that some day that will come true. I love how I can hold out on parts until I get more money to really upgrade this machine.
Linus: Dell promised to deliver the gold standard for all laptops buy the end of this year. Where's my fucking USB Type A Dell! 14:05  -This reminded me of the joker and batman banter in Harley quin show.
The only thing i would update is My gpu and it's the only thing You don't review
Looks good, added myself to Aussie pre-order notification, hope by then there is a touch screen option! :)
The shaky chauffeur immuhistochemically learn because water subcellularly colour amongst a bashful laugh. wry,  fixed dugout
$2500 for a laptop with no graphics card? Are you serious?
Good for them to be on a big and relevant channel like LTT! I hope this will be successful and that they will launch in Europe.
Subscribed to be notified when they start shipping to France. Hopefully soon, I could use a laptop replacement.. Before I start only replacing parts of my laptop in the future.. ;)
I'm so getting this as soon as it's available in the UK Edit: Just pre-ordered! Arrives in February
Most don’t have a driver installer in unattended mode because they want to trick less savvy users into installing bundled bloatware.
We need to make this company successful! If it is, other laptop companies will have to follow ! That’s great for consumers
the antenna cables are swapped
I really hope that this company will be successful because that will force other laptop makers to make their products upgradable as well
I buy
Holy shit, I never thought this is possible since big companies that priorities simplicity like apple always lock everything and make their stuff boring
at around 5:58 linus says he wouldnt boot off a tb drive. though i didnt catch him specifying, i assume its an ssd. ive been booting off a 1 tb hdd. i assume this is still fine but can anyone with more knowledge let me know what he means
Anyone else triggered that Linus connected the wifi cables the wrong way around?
You’re not gonna believe this but you just saved our store over 2grand. Been working on a laptop that wouldn’t boot (it did when it arrived) and it’s gotten to the point where we were about to buy him a new one and after I heard you say some you have to fully close, I tried it today and it worked bro. (Computer store lol)
Can't believe I just bought one. I already have an xps15 but this just seems so cool
The fact that Louis rossmann gave his approval is just astounding i wish all high end laptops were like this
The only problem I can see with unattended driver configuration is the potential security vulnerability. But if it's just a personal or small business computer, it's probably not an issue for most users.
Ok, this is my next laptop.
this is the definition of a niche product man. The only people that will buy it are enthusiasts and people in the industry... and Im not even sure if industry people would go for it. Shit Ive worked IT professionally for 12 years and honestly laptops are best disposable. They get lost/stolen/broken and when its your main tool you dont have time for the bullshit.
This is a pretty cool concept. I really like where they are headed! Though if I were to make one complaint about the body and form factor that they chose for this product, it is that you have to take it apart to swap out batteries. It would be nice if the battery had its own bay. That would make it absolutely perfect.
Frameworks has an interesting concept. I hope they are successful. As one other person said this is Frameworks "v.1"  I'd be looking for a unit that wasn't a gaming machine.  A fair amount of the manufacturers in the rush to make their rigs sleek, slim and lightweight have made their devices even less upgradable and therefore more disposable. I love that Frameworks has an easily replaceable battery which gives the laptop more longevity and perhaps future improved battery tech. I've replaced HDDs with SSD and added memory myself or had MicroCenter do the upgrades. A lot of the sleek laptops don't allow for such upgrades. I'd much rather get a higher grade CPU in a laptop with room to upgrade the SSD and memory later that's within my budget than to have to settle for a less powerful CPU rig with soldered in components.  The possibility in the future of an upgradable CPU/motherboard would be outstanding!  2 last thoughts,  1. maybe Frameworks could see if AMD might be willing to  work with them about an upgradable CPU/mobo component.  2. Perhaps Frameworks could partner with MicroCenter for a retail presence.   Good luck!
This is very interesting, but the only way to change the market its by people, and the majority doesnt mind on customizable products or upgrading. By the way, I hope they success  and we can have more and more affordable laptops, cause, $1000 dolars its a lot of money for the people that really need an upgradeable and long life/lifespan computer. (Sorry for my english)
So rich he's buying sponsors. Must be nice
Looks like Framework's making products not just to make money but to win hearts.
Damn this shit is so cool, I wish I had money
I'm not really convinced of this concept unless they release all of the measurements required for developing third party parts. That way any person or company can design their own extensions. On their website they're talking about "a community of partners" but it's not entirely clear if they are planning an open system.   The same goes for FairPhone by the way. Apparently FairPhone 3 is discontinued already? What if they run out of parts? And what if Framework Computer Inc runs out of parts?  This is an improvement of course but it could be much more robust. If you're gonna appeal to a certain crowd you gotta do it right. I might be asking for too much though. Creating an open standard is going to be much more difficult than just creating a single functional modular laptop. I can only hope that is going to be the endgame for the Framework Computer company.
at least a 1080 GPU, really good touchscreen, and a full swivel hinge and this laptop wpuld be pretty much perfect.  a really nice idea and at a great price.  i really hope that framework finds success not only for their sake but to also rattle everybody else's cages.  imagine calling yourself an american company like crapple and dell and using our tax funded roads to ship the e-waste you laughingly call HigH eND coMpoNNenTs and restrict the same people that paid money for those roads from the freedom of self repair.  dunno about yall but that sounds like theft and treason, bois.  everybody gets a torch and a pitchfork

I wish that I could put MAC OS on this it would be the perfect laptop solution for many people that don't wasn't to commit to a Linux OS
Did anyone point out that you plugged the wires wrong on the wifi card?
Its so mind blowing to understand what Framework has done here with a laptop form factor. But on the other hand, are you really surprised? The fact that the screws are color coded is a perfect example. I believe that the laptop manufacturers never adopted this idea because they wanted to eliminate consumer repair as much as possible.   #Respect2Framework
"apple spends billions of dollars on rnd."  wat?  it takes billions of dollars to assemble e-waste cpus in china's slave camps and drop them inside the same blank white box??????????  i think you meant apple spends billions on its marketing campaign my guy lmao  lmao apple rnd  i like your funny words funny man
lol laptop broke and I need to crack it open to fix it but manufacturers make it almost impossible to fix it so *I dont break it*  wat????????????????????????  who swallows this bs?
I never comment on yt videos so this is a huge deal but holy f*** that is awesome
so this is Ikea of laptop
I want this company to succeed
i hate tinner laptops.. the p series from thinkpad is what i use since 2010
There is no mention of the graphics card in this laptop. Or did I miss it?
Do it macOS and use it as max
I know why it doesn't but man I wish it had a discreate GPU.
This is the beginning of something amazing.
so..... "It's better than Dell"  award :P
I'm really impressed so I'm looking into this Framework❤️💕❤️
Love the idea, doubt I will buy it as I need a laptop in October.   I have sketches of modular storage and power for phones in a book I made "inventions" in when I was like 7 years old.
Bless you framework for proving what can be done, and doing it. My next laptop will be a framework.
When he is still pirating windows 😭😭
this team at framework should need more love
Linus PLEASE put the fucking laptop down
Honestly, it looks really promising and all but isn't for me right now. I decided on getting a gen 1 P17 for my next laptop but I know that I'll keep a note to check on these guys when I run that into the ground in 10 years and am looking for a replacement. Great stuff.
No dedicated gpu though
I don't have a laptop. I found one I want to have.
that's great. i may have to buy a laptop sometime soon. i'm pretty sure that i will buy this one. ...would be even better to see a "convertible" version of that, too (i.e. one which can be used as a tablet as well, by flipping the display all the way around to the backside).
Best moment 14:18  mmm yes fuck
It does look like a Nerdbook  lol It just reminds me of Red-Green "If they can't find you handsome, they can at least find you handy". I think it's great though!
waiting for a 15/17 inch variant..
Why not update it?????
8:17 LINUS DROP TIPS!!!!!!!!!
11:53 this is what happens when you hire editors whose only work experience is making ytp's
Hmm... I'm genuinely interested in this product which is rare for me with these quirky but intriguing small company ideas. Me thinks I will be spending a bit of time researching tomorrow. The idea that my laptop bag can just carry all the modules I might need literally anywhere without taking up space alone is a HUGE sell. I don't always need a display port connector. But man when I do... I really hope this gets a lot of attention and doesn't die out because if they can keep this running, I see potential for a huge upset in the laptop market. If I can work this into the budget.. I think I may just pull the trigger. I've been looking for a laptop that isn't my $3000 HP Spectre I'm too scared to take anywhere for fear of it breaking. If it breaks.. Just buy the component(s) to get it running again.
Me as a worker in the industry: LINUS WTF HAPPENT TO YOYR NOTE9?!?!?
I hope this works, but I always believe if sth is too good to be true, it is
Just 4 IO ports is very little though. I have 4 USB ports (one USB-C), Display Port, HDMI, jack in/out, LAN and a card reader in my laptop. In this framework laptop I'd need to choose 4 of them and I have 7 connected right at this moment (and still have a free slot for a USB stick).
Im canada building it yourself makes it more expensive with the same parts wtf its 200$ more not inclusing ports
If Fry's Electronics stores were still around, they'd be all over this.
I've never felt warm and happy looking at the insides of a laptop.. until now.  That thing was really designed with a lot of care.  There are so many little touches in places where most people will never see... I really appreciate that.  If I was looking for a laptop now, I'd buy this no question.
What games are you able to play on it? It isn't able to have an external GPU right?
1TB for big fat steam Library????? That's like few old games i have on my PC
I see why they all suck ... The good people are no longer there
A laptop everyone deserves.
i once had a dell laptop it was very old and it had 2 ddr3 ram slots and an upgradable cpu so you are wrong
So it is technically possible add a TPM to this laptop and run windows 11?
Please NO TOUCH option. Adults only. :-)
I'm in. I've been waiting for this for the last 30 years!
OMG I'm in love! <3
nouice!
11:53 Linus just came.
This actually reminds me, I was pulling apart my families old laptop (would have been from around mid to late 2000's) and it had a removable CPU which was pretty cool to see.
I'm definitely gonna be keeping a close eye on this one
Sold.
I will re-watch it I am looking for information about future style options.
I just want a laptop that is just that.... not the burning pits of hell on my balls....
Watching this again to boost views. I _really_ hope this company doesn't go under.
Can you even plug in the components into other pcs? If the 1TB drive is usb c I should be able, right?
This blows my mind. Am looking for a new lappy, cause both my hp and surface failed after a decade. Repairing both failed (Surface not yet done, HP is trash due tue locked bios -.-). I will have a close look at this.
i hate Windoze - Apple for decades.  i’m considering this for my DJ and Vmix laptop.  never thought i’d have those thoughts.
I need a personal laptop early next year, I will probably be getting this one. It's such a cool concept, and it doesn't sacrifice portability!
It's almost 2am here and I'm watching this video in 240p, the video quality changed so drastically at 15:05 that I thought it was the auto adjust for quality. I don't know if it's my eyes or the night screen filter but the webcam video was much more clearer and crisper than the rest. So weird lmao.
Imagine if planned obsolescence wasn't a thing. Imagine if customer-hostile design wasn't a natural part of the profit motive.
promote this for 'the sake of end user'
Take notes, Apple
I almost spat my tea out at 11:52 🥵😝
hp is one of those manufacturers who doesn't give any information about components thy don't even mention whether there laptops support dual channel or not.
Honestly I feel like this is the way forward for hardware manufacturers as tech becomes more durable and powerful
Nice!
This is the most enthusiastic and impressed I’ve seen him
So fun fact: HP actually has made guides on a few laptops of theirs on how to replace internal components (not external IO like on the Framework laptop though) and this makes me happy that they're encouraging people to replace and repair their stuff :D  Update: The specific laptop I learned this through would be HP's Victus laptop, not sure this holds completely with other HP laptops. I recently bought the Victus laptop due to it being a well-performing and easily upgradeable laptop.
People are always asking me what laptop they should be getting and I have various answers depending on their needs... I might just always point them to a single one now. And being able to keep spare adapters depending on your need... genius.
If only everything was built like this. This is amazing.
I just have to say, I have never seen a video that made me change my mind about something I thought was fundament this quickly! Holy s#%t! Thanks Linus!
Google designed a modular phone a few years ago, this looks like a total ripoff.
Nice! My laptop died on me a few months ago, so I'm needing a new one once I can afford it. This thing sounds like it'd be an awesome option!  Not sure what's wrong with my laptop (DELL Inspiron 5000). It turns on, brings up an error screen saying something went wrong and that it's going to scan for errors and will restart when done. However, before it even gets to 1%, it restarts itself and gets trapped in an infinite loop of load, "check for errors and restart", premature-restart, repeat...
I like wired mice, you never have a dongle to lose and they just feel more reliable, never will a battery issue come up.   Problem is finding them for a decent price.
I love that he's every bit as giddy and excited about this laptop as I am.
🙏🏾👍🏽👏👏👏
obviously they gonna need to keep selling spares for everything all their career so people can fix their laptops with oem parts all the time.
… I want one.
Haha, I don't even need a notebook and I want one.  LOL  I REALLY want these guys to succeed.
ayo what up bbb
How much did your order cost?
I loved that hotshot at dell
Hi, i have a question. i have motherboard ASROCK H410M-HVS and a 500W MegaMax power supply and GTX 1650 Super OC Phoenix. I want to know if I can ugrade my graphics card to rtx 2060 and would i need for that a better PSU or not. Thank you in advance.
dammit, just bought a new laptop before I saw this
So what's the betting someone try's to buy them out/off??
it doesn't even have a graphics card.. ofc its going to be thin
Sir I am wondering if you could please make a show an tell on how to set up a gaming pc to use Ubuntu? I have win 10 now but I can not see trashing a good pc just to install win 11. Yes my system is over 8 years old but it still does what I need. Thank you in advance Frank
I wanna support them!!! <3
Love this. I've been feeling like right to repair has been slowly fading away. This is a glimmer of hope
linus is on the verge of tears throughout this whole video
I love this product but what is the gpu ?? am i blind ? cant even see it on their website :) ?
its pretty cool, but i mean... taking apart laptops and iphones and such is actually really easy
cute pc
but what if you boot off those drives to allow yourself to secure separate operating systems...hackers would love something like this, bitcoin wallets....
They will sell out to a Microsoft or Apple in the next 2 years.
Imagine a "Docking Station" for this? Simple 1cm thick, 1cm larger diameter Device, that you lay this into. It plugs into any power source, solar, battery, or wall- and charges the cell, connects to the storage with WIFI, to transfer. The Dock can be plugged into a TV or monitor. I'd like to see Devices come with solar voltaic cases, notebooks, tablets, phones, etc. so it's always  charged or easily charged.
Update: i decided to get one and the next shipment will be for October. Not only will it be a fantastic computer for years to come, but i want to put my money where my mouth is and support companies that actually understand how important and good for everyone right to repair from design to hardware to os to software is for everyone. I can't wait to sticker it all up;
If I'll ever meet Linus I won't let him to hold my laptop, I was afraid for this one's safety for a whole video :)
No Canadian store yet?
Let's spread this! 🤩
wow, just wow. genius concept pulled off so good
I'm just worried they go bankrupt in few years and no upgrade will be available ever.
Imagine this but with a better GPU. I would be completely sold!
Those excuses never held water to bloody begin with.
Imma buy this when I get a job. Hope this product skyrockets the market when it is launched!
Very impressive, this is a well designed device
hey linus does this video also hurt your soul https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxhNEl8QmV8
Linus is the Scotty Kilmer of hardware.
I do the exact same thing with a laptop. Mouse has to go on the left side and wrap around.
So when the Fairhope review
"The justification that traditional laptop manufactures have had for making everything so integrate and so impossible to upgrade"...Yeah. That's all "smoke and mirrors", or theatre if you will. Or, you know. Lying.   It's all about planned obsolescence and end-user aftermarket control. One part breaks and you have to chuck it? You have to buy a new one. One part breaks and you try to fix their specialised, proprietary system? You either "void" the warranty, or have to take your machine in-house to fix it, where they can control the labor and the quality of repairs. It's the same with cars and car repairs. Obfuscation of design is a huge money maker.
These are great...BUT ....Have any of you seen the prices?!?   I tried to configure my current laptop that was $600ish and the base model you start with on this website is $1,000.  I think my laptop would be double the price if I tried to configure a comparable laptop from framework.    I was really excited when I saw this video and I was literally planning on buying one immediately but not only are the prices ridic but it's not the customization dream laptop you made it out to be.    If one usb c port is actually for charging,   I can then decide if I want an HDMI out or a second USB-C.   If I want an SD card slot and an HDMI out then the user is left with 1 USB C & 1 USB A.  This laptop should ship with a USB hub to plug into the one USB the laptop will likely have.
I hope this really gets sucessful and make all the big companys look outdated so customization trend comes back to mainstream. I am really sick of the current way how just everything became a capitalistic thing that don't care about identity. If this thing whole case can be customized, i already see people doing 3d printed cases that suits high end stuff.
This product and company make my heart smile, I really wish i needed a new laptop right now!
Ok I’m in. Now make me a chonky boi for gaming.
@linus - Last time I saw this was on my Seger 486 dx233 (taiwan) laptop in like 1994. Awesome to see people leading with what they believe. Would be really cool if they could have a dock that had higher end CPUs in it for higher end rendering, or CPU/Video intensive applications like Propeller head's Reason and Autodesk Revit respectively.
this is soo good. Added to my wishlist when i buy a laptop
Oh. My. God. I love this thing.
Wow damn I wanna invest too. I'm still in school though so I can't put in like 10k immediately. Guess I'll have to wait for them to go public
Hold on, he said he also bought the Segway to the sponsor? That's not how it supposed to work
that will be my next laptop
I think a good market for this would be in developing countries. Places where 'credit' is not as liberal like in progressive countries like the U.S.. Places where a machine's longevity could go up to 10 years or more, due to the steep price of newer models, and upgradability is always the better option, more on an economic standpoint first, and utility second.
DO NOT GET MAGNETIC CHARGING CONNECTORS FOR LAPTOPS!  I have experience with magnetic USB connectors and i can tell you right now that you will get metal bits at the ends and you will cause minor shorts. I can only imagine that they would be far more serious with much higher wattage.
Dell is going the apple route. With my job we use the dell precision lines. The 7710, 7720, 7730, 7740 all has the back panels easy to remove to access the board and take the battery out, upgrade ram, hard drives, etc... The back is split up in 2 parts. 1 is a switch that opens half of the back with no screw driver needed. This lets you access the battery and 1 of the hard drive slots. The second panel is only held by 2 screws that then drops the second half of the panel to access the rest of the board to do what you need.  The 7750 and 7760 has changed. Its a single back panel that has like 8 screws and the panel is the bottom half of the frame of the laptop not just flat panels.  So its harder to open.  This is crazy and concerning for us IT guys. I work in IT that has to open this as we get them to configure and put in the hard drives in a certain way according to our specs needed. It is a bear when you order 100 of these and have to open each and every one of them to put in the hard drives.
This will be my next laptop. Consistently, my past 5 laptops have met the end of their life when the power port wears out.
Modular is the way to go.  Death to proprietary non user repairable electronics.
Louis is gonna spontaneously jizz when he has to repair one
Am I the only one who reacts how careless and whimsical Linus handles the laptop and the components? Almost dropped it straight out of the box even.
damn i'm impressed with this modular design. i think i just found my next upgrade.
Great, Now I observed the first safety rule has been broken. You have on a ring on each hand finger the possibilities of occurring a "Short  Circuit" is high. I am happy nothing went wrong. "SAFETY ALWAYS" There are other safety issues but I will not get into technical work.
Oh, dear. I have just bought a new laptop. Had I known that this model existed, I would definitely have considered this model. My Dell model at least has replaceable battery, memory and dual SSD and includes Linux support.
I've already heard of Framework here in Germany and I'm already waiting for the laptops, because all other brands really quickly produce rubbish so that people keep buying new laptops. Finally a manufacturer who also builds a laptop sustainably, as it actually has to be today at this time. I like the whole concept of the company to make everything interchangeable, keep it up, you know what people want, at least people like me.
Ok this is awesome. I hope they don't go under. I will defo be getting one
Linus, there already ARE USB-C loading cables which are magnetic charging. You basically put the magnetic USB-C plug into the port and boom. Now you have a magnetic charger.  Because on the other side there's a cable with a magnet on it's end.
Hope this company doesn't pull a OnePlus 🙄😤
This is incredible, but until it's able to deliver a dedicated GPU I'm not sure how well it will do. The kinds of people who care about being able to upgrade their laptops are, typically, the same people who would care about having a dedicated GPU. When that happens though I'll be first in line!
I do mostly video editing work on a desktop, but I occasionally do work on a laptop and even use it for purely data wrangler for example. Having a modular laptop would be perfect, as I don’t need one laptop for one task. I’m soldddd
1TB....Big Fat Steam Library?   Are you high?  I just had to add a second 6TB drive to add games mods and DLC.
I havnt owned a laptop in many years. I only have one pc that I just built a year ago to play games and stream. I Barly got into computers a few years ago. I'm definitely going to check this out and possibly buy it!
I don't think it's even unthinkable to consider that they may even be able to make available one of the new AMD APU's which would broaden the capabilities quite a bit.  I'm impressed.
How linux-friendly is the hardware?
Got mine to support the dream, but will be onboard the second they offer a GPU. MXM or something better? Seriously gpu and customizable cooling and I will put money down on one no questions asked.   Or a 2in1?  I would live on a laptop that I knew I could keep and continually upgrade. Or swap chassis? Drop it off a table and salvage what I can into a new frame, replace damaged components?  Do a phone next.
Buying a Prebuilt is cheaper to buy and to replace:/ also no GPU
Millennials invented IBM Thinkpad.
Do these not have an option on graphics?
LINUX DRIVERS FOR THE FINGERPRINT SCANNER! I actually screamed with joy when I heard that.
You use wired mice for better response!
Bro ik you got a massive net worth and you can buy me, but like seriously, please give some more care to holding/ caring of the equipment you showcase. I really don't mind what you do after man but just off camera I don't mind, on camera it stresses me out man lmao
Kinda reminds me of the old Dell Latitude CPi-A with the Modular Bays. You could add a 2nd battery, CD Drive or diskette drive!
My next laptop
I would love to see an AMD version
Best PC build is the box 18:13
Looks incredible. I wish them well.
I want an upgradable gamer laptop ☹
Wont be long before the tech giant buy, patent, seal and bury this concept for good..
Thinkpads - Am I a joke to you?
yeah, will see... hope not end up like 'project ara'
Everybody should share this and @ every large corpo company on social media
Just need dbrand to do their magic on this and I'm sold.
I love the idea so much, i wanna order one to Germany now! :-)
"Laptops only have CPU's that are soldiered in." NOT TRUE.  I have upgraded many laptops that had your typical ZIF socket.  Yes some don't but some do.
4:10 whoa there Linus 4:15 no... Linus. Stop
My D blown
For linus to get that excited surely be doing them a world of good
something about module based interchangeable tech is so fucking cool to me why isnt most stuff just built like lego, seriously imagine a sturdy and reliable system that just snaps into place as if its a child's toy
Liuns ask Elon Musk to send you his version of his latest components in a laptop version using his newest technology and see what's possible in his world on loan only for a few days see if its possible to get a draft of this technology
Awesome video, I'm in love with the concept but JESUS CHRIST LINUS STOP SWINGING THAT THING AROUND!
Linus being excited about this makes me so happy.
most people couldn't care less about a laptop being thinner than a newspaper, just make sure it's can be comfortably carried with one hand and we good. legit love the idea of this keyboard, especially if they also expand their range to have other models including a rugged that all use the same motherboard, maybe even look at a handheld console like the steam deck on their motherboard.
Sadly I can think how it will fail as the average consumer is brainwashed to the point of thinking its pointless to upgrade, when you can buy a new one.
If you order this computer, when will you get it ? I want it for my studies, etc. Will I get it in a month ? Next year ? Next month ? I need someone to answer this, I can't find the answer on google
colour coded screws almost make this worth it alone.  l learned to dab screws with a fat marker after i killed an iphone by putting the wrong screw in the right hole.  fuck apple.
4 minutes in, and I want one!
11:53 Funniest shit ive ever seen
Yay!!! A laptop that can be upgraded!! Just in time for the worldwide electronics shortage.
8:33 BULLSHIT, Dell Precision Models have CPU socket that allows you to swap CPU with 0 soldering knowledge... How I know that? I own one and I did it.
Note to self: If I ever meet Linus, DO NOT MENTION APPLE AND get a temporary android phone so he doesn't see my iphone. I don't want to get yelled at. lol
Does it have the ability to use thunderbolt since it's an Intel CPU?
The only issue I see... Is ... Games. Using built in graphics cards is painful. That would be the one thing that could hold me back.   If it turns out they can somehow be attached (don't care if its dangling... I'll only use it when I'm next to a power supply) it would mean this would have to be it.   That is the one thing that has me in a bind.
You should water cool a pc with an air conditioner
Please give a poor man a great present and let me have one of your many gaming laptops. Sincerely a poor young man.
comes a company with a Uphone everything in it you decide almost like a salad bar except electronic and more expensive
2:42 Linus:... For the 300$ Me: Ok i know what i need i need this laptop! Linus continues: Of saving Me: :-( My Brain: An Error has Occured.
They should launch it in India & it will b a huge success.
11:31 EHEMMM DELL
This is the most impressive laptop I've seen. And most impressed Linus I've seen also.
I'm definitely going to support this company the next time I have to buy a laptop, especially if they build an ARM variant.  Off-topic, anyone ever wonder how much Linus spends on coke per day?  I'm guessing it's about the GDP of a small country.  Maybe Malawi.
Linus: 👇 NEXT NEXT NEXT NEXT NEXT His table: 👁👄👁
Replaceable motherboard with CPU and gpu and screen and it will be top
I love it! This reminds me of some older laptops I used to have and it just feels right. If only I could afford one.
Now i can just change the battery on the go no need of charging edit - yes it will actually do that
Fairly speaking, this should be the future of laptops and why not even desktops! Changing your specs so easily without too much knowledge, like knowing if components are compatible between them, just choose your model and see all the upgrades available, open it and switch them like Linus showed, and selling it for a affordable price is the smart way to go, I'd rather purchase the product itself for a reasonable amount and then upgrade it to my needs, now this is a smart company and product.
That's why you need engineers as heads of companies not fucking salespeople. Thank you Linus for showing these guys to us. I think as computer community we have to help such companies to flourish as it is good for the market and consumer.  Such products cause the carbon footprint per individual to go down as fewer products over time requires to be created.  If they could also modular the graphic cards and CPU that would have been amazing.
where to buy it
this is better than old stupid laptop ,so convenience and can use which we really used
They should have a gaming option as well. I could really see the benefit or a motherboard upgrade.  For office use, I still have a 8 years old Dell and it is still good for most uses. I have already changed the hard-drive by SSD, upgraded the memory and change the battery, which at that time were still external. That's modular enough 😉
That should be the standard, not the other way. Spending millions and make it hard to fix or impossible to upgrade, just for 0.5mm thinner...
Apple Mac team is shitting their pants right now.  I bet you Apple will somehow copy their design and say its "innovative" and "original".  Props to the Framework guys, If they pull this off. I wish the best for their team.  It is nice to see innovative companies breaking away from the norms.
I like it's potential
i want one, but framwork dont sell in my cuntry
Respect to Framework.
Repairable upgradeable and good looking. Basically a not laptop bc i forgot wt it is
I'm sold
I don't need a laptop but I'd like to buy one just to support this kind of approach.
This is the future of laptops 💻🤩
Great idea. How about some Ryzen models.
If every laptop is like this, everything cyberpunk
how dual boot in dual monitors with 1 pc
Sir, please stop holding the laptop WITH THE TIP OF YOUR FINGERS AWAY FROM YOUR BODY, or else i'm gonna have to sue you for traumatic experience.
17:11 Has an unlimited budget for buying tech, won't activate windows
I might gift this to myself as a graduation present
Really cool but ahead of their time. In 40 years prob 20% of the us population would value this but today it's 1%. Not a solid market. sorry
This would be crucial for the industrial market.  Office people are very finicky.
Can u send me a pc i want it so much and i can't afford it.
Missing the CPU and GPU upgrade options.
I have no idea how I got here but I'm really glad I did. I love keeping things for as long as possible; an easily upgradable/repairable laptop is a long time coming.
Does this guy live in a giant IKEA ?
no matter what product linus review it's need to go dropped on the floor
The biggeis will not let them survive, period!!!
you can tell just how hyped he is about this product, there shouldn't be a single person who dislikes this concept except for those working at ms or apple
You mentioned laptop cpus being soldered on. I have a laptop that has a socketable cpu. It's old now, being a first gen i7... an asus g53. It sits in a closet, because of having aged beyond it's use, but... still, that was a thing, and should become a thing again.
The only laptop I'm still willing to buy🙌
Now all we need is one with a spot for some sort of GPU
This is heaven in consumer electronics considering that lessens the electronic waste and also you don't have to throw away the device itself when one of it's parts is damaged
There were several moments there that I legit thought Linus was going to literally cry for joy.
I want one, but i live in germany. Any idea if this is going international?
i think its more like sure ye there is a huge chunk of use who love the fact this has so many things to tinker with its great.. i also think they tihink of it in a way thats like, man if someone wants to RMA this to us because they dont know what they are doing we kinda have a way to fix it easily as well..  every other company just chucks it in the trash after transferring the hardrive and goes.. heres your replacement
This is such a mind opener for laptop power users that would rather work on their own laptop. Looks like I found a laptop to replace my existing laptop. 👍🏽
i will buy one next year. money needs to be invested in myself at the moment :)
"The dell's not even fkn thinner" You can tell Linus is genuinely impressed with what Framework has done lol
The fact that we are surprised by a company that makes a product with the consumer as first priority in mind should be a reality check.
I need a 4 slot RTX 30 series MOD block for mine! Who's with me?!
Same problem with USB port on the right when i was using wire mouse
For the people who keep commenting about phones. This was in development. Idk what happened to it, still looking forward to it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDAw7vW7H0c
I dont know why i love listening to Linus, as i dont have a clue about anything he talks about. Yet, i do understand a few words he says.
I need this
dbrand can make this look very good
Who makes these subtitles? Why is "seque" spelled as "segway"?
Ok but it's too expensive for what it is. I would be 100% on board if it were cheaper than buying a laptop performance wise
finally a human computer
Is this good for a teacher
yep this has thunderbolt 4 all round
The g-skill is the first… (I skip 10 seconds) graphics card
game changer
I'm buying this… But they absolutely MUST provide keyboards with Tux and Bestie replacements for the Windows Logo.
Anybody know anything about GPU's and this? Could this be a content creation laptop?
14:16
It would be cool if they will build workstation grade portables. I really, really, really, REALLY love this!!!
It's not even Fucking THINNER
Whoa the way Linus holds the laptop scares me sometimes
All the swearing,  completely not necessary. You act like you invented and made the thing, your vibe is one of feeling very superior,  wirh o er 3 miljon subs things are getting to your head, is my impression…
Annoying, irritating idiot, fooling afound with the hardware, dropping stuff and such.. camerawork i very de ent though,  lose ups when it is needed ro show what you are doing…. Basic message, that the laptop is easily maintained, upgraded and repaired is  clear. Good thing your cameraman is knowledgeable, helps to tell the story. Otherwise, it qould have been a really bad  video….
Where's the upgradable dedicated graphics option? It's the main thing that I always want to be able to upgrade on a laptop.
I did not saw an Ethernet port option to this laptop, It would be kind of great
Now if only they could make a super cheap version and then to top it off a cell phone where we dont have to pay $600 for a new screen. SUPPORT THESE GUYS AND GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!!! lol
Best part 16:44
why is linus the gordan ramsay of the tech world
I do enjoy everything about what I'm seeing here and I think I'd definitely buy one in the future but.. I configured one on their website with only a 250G ssd, ubuntu self install, and only 16gb of ram for $1600. I get it, I maxed out everything else, but if it's going to cost MINIMUM a grand for some upgradability then I'd rather just spend a couple hundred for a newer thinkpad with linux. I'm using a T510 with ubuntu rn that I bought for $100 and for all it's setbacks I just can't justify that kinda money for customization. Very awesome company though and I'll keep following their progress.
FACK APPple and any other scalpers!
I don't care, the cost is worth it. Whoever has the money, BUY THESE THINGS.
User-customization and ease of access is the exact thing I've wanted in a laptop, for so long.
You sold me
What about the video card? Is the upgradeable? Or is that locked to the motherboard?
I want to buy one, but I already have a descent 3rd gen ryzen laptop, so its not really smart to just waste money, I hope they succeed honestly, def I would have gone for it if I did not buy my laptop yet
Too bad its not available with an EU keyboard layout :( Would order immediately otherwise
This is exactly what needs to replace the entire laptop market, immediately.
Those little antenna connectors that attach to network cards etc have a great little dedicated plastic tool you can pick up that makes attaching and removing them much easier. Or you can use a black stick but not as easy
C'mon already.... When are the AMD Ryzen options coming?? Please all add your voices to this request!
THIS is what Im talking about. Perfect choice of screen res for everyday use too.  Now they just need to do an AMD Advantage edition for some crazy good performance and battery life and I'm in!
FYI: choosing the "Framework Laptop DIY Edition" base actually costs a lot more since every little thing is a cost add on. while the prebuilt one comes with some at no extra charge. check both options and see for yourself, maybe I made a mistake in the selections.
17:17 remember to activate windows🙃
I may have thought if a way to make a replaceable laptop CPU but it be large as fk
15:41 haha
Hey look, a dog on a chair. Cool laptop though.
How does this guy have 10M+ subs!? This is just shout out advertisement.  Don't get me wrong, I love the concept and it seems really cool. But if you say nothing critical about a product, I tend to not believe anything at all!
The non-modular IO being a headphone jack is a disappointment. Why not make upgradable soundcards? 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
sry if its a noob question, but what abt the graphic cards
Just had a look at the website, and from what I can see it doesn't look like any of the models allow you to add a discrete graphics card. If that's the case, I'm a little disappointed because a GPU is one of the main things I'd think would be important to upgrade in a modular laptop, but I'll keep an eye out for if that's supported.
I'm sold. I'd really like to wait for a 10-point touchscreen, but Ima take the plunge after scrimping from the next couple of paychecks...
Aside from THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBLETOP, my fav thing was "Cry me a river, Linus." Bwahaha!
Damn this laptop seems like the laptop for me after building two desktops. I would get on but there is only the option to have integrated graphics.
Those other premium built Laptops may feel tough but when you drop them, flexibility is all that matters. With a magnesium or aluminum case, that same energy deforms the metal or transfers it to the display glass. Something has to bend to absorb the energy.
I want thaaat :)
Where’s the gpu
1,900 apple employees disliked...
this was a nice presentation but what about how hot this thing gets ? and do you hear the fans all the time ? and i dont like displays that look like a mirror. I wouldnt mind a thicker one too ... i mean its amazing what you can fit in almost no space . Also a 17´ would be nice
sad reality is that good things like these gets crushed by the big players and competetion
Recon this might be a good choice for a low end gaming pc at some point?
Apple spends millions of dollars in R&D to find out ways to skim money out of end user. They are like East India Company of laptop world.
I hope they become really big they totally deserve it
Damn,,, I want this..
Common sense was used when making this laptop, not profits
God I wish I had the money I want to support this so bad!!!!!
Only thing I've noticed is you can't configure a GPU. You are stuck with Iris Xe. 😢
solid!
Guys please buy.m orderning one
$1000 to start?  that is way too much money for mainstream to dive into. I got an Acer 5 with an MX1050 I5 for $550 in another 4 years I can get something comparable for$550. This has to start at a maximum of $300 with an I5 or Ryzen and then add the rest, other than that it will be a niche Item
can anyone hear it ?       *it's apple running out of excuses*
I want to buy one. But I want it bigger. That is a 13" I want a 15" that has a number pad on the keyboard.
I'm definitely buying this
Iam watching your videos for a long time now (with no comment) and iam going to just leave this one comment for you, in the field you work there are all kinds of people with all kinds of level of knowledge on electronics and computers, i would categorize them for the sake of this reply. first level is the guys which either are educated about all of the stuff in an institue or college or completely learned it by themselves, either way they are aware of all the aspects of this field and completely understands you (except for you really speaking fast that part everyone get confused about😒) secpnd is the people who dont have that education or all of that knowledge but over time learned stuff because they were fascinated by computers and are fund of them or didnt trusted repair shops and wanted to do it themselves and so over time they learned stuff here and there and have a somewhat mixed knowledge about stuff and are interested in learning more (step by step not all of us are super computers who can digest billions of data in half a second!) now they are the majority in youtube tech and they are still learning bits from here and there and collecting and processing them for themselves. for them your videos are complicated and you sometimes just assume that people know some of the stuff that you are going to say which are default knowledge for you and the first section of my discussion, videos about tech in youtube need to be more comprehensive and simple and also should contain every aspect which is key in computing because ignoring one aspect in a system which all components are tied together can be catastrophic (talk simple) now there are different levels of this second large group with different knowledege so that even makes your work even harder and i get that you try to target an specific audience but thats not going to work because every person that come to watch your videos isnt a full time nerd. some come for an specific part or purpose and not all of them are complete computer monsters so i have a recommendation for you. if you want to be a good guide regarding all things electronic computing, you need to provide simple, step by step and primary instruction videos explaining everything (slowly, you talk very fast man put yourself on slowmotion. english isnt everyones main language) regarding the computers and how they work and how parts are tied amd work together in a graphic and simple guide, then you put numbers on those videos and everytime that you have a new video that there is a part in it which is needed to be explained for simple users so that they can understand it as well you will refer them to that numbered video and help them understand instead of sending them for a research in google that can be a pain in the buttock with the bomb of information that is there, i think providing a completely full and simple instruction set on computers will help a lot of people that use them everyday but dont know how they work and are curious though, because computer world is very complicated and vast. Also a lot of us would be happy if you add the factor of availability of objects and stuff in other world regions to your videos as well, you cruelly completely focus all of your attention to those who live in your area!!! you wont going to progress much if you limit yourself to an area and that is a fact in this nowadays worldc the world isnt just US and canada you know!!! With that i wrap up my comment which is based on watching your videos silently over years and it is the most accurate and true comment of all times based on your channels activity! I dare anyone who think opposite to give me an example which they will obviously fail to do so since i can do magic.😌   Some guy from middle earth.
framework is the only laptop manufacturer i deem worthy of my money from now on
Surprisingly I opened up my base model hp laptop today and most of the important stuff was labeled, not with “storage” or “ram” bu a quick google search of war it said on said label’s would’ve told you all you need to know
Ah a laptop that makes u FEEL like building a pc
I like how thumbnail is cursed, when Type-C port is connected via Micro-USB
In the 90's Intel pushed the "White Box" version of this.  It was not as complete as this one but i bought  on from a company and built it myself  and enjoyed its use for many years.
like, i got a surface laptop for work and this looks eerily similar in design
This is more detailed than Dave
They need good PR, some1 good in marketing and aftersale service, Linus HELP THEM!
If it had AMD integrated GFX, I'd buy it. However, I fully support this kinds of tech. Moar!
Most laptop users will show no interest, and this products margins are most likely not great. It will need a lot of purchases from techies to succeed, if it can at all.
frame work , must open dealerships in SOUTH AFRICA their will be a market for it !.
I would love to have a laptop like this but think have to wait a long for framework to setup in India 😂
Fuck. This is the future. I just want a matte screen with good color accuracy - full SRGB if you will + ryzen setup 👀
Finally someone made a laptop worth buying!!!
if you pause at 8:17 the moment it hits the ground you can see the text "bye" LOL!  EDIT: 11:28 LOLOLOLOLL! 😂😂 14:15 SHOTS FIRED! 🤣🤣
What's missing:  replaceable motherboard, 360° hinge, touch display, GPU module, option for fanless motherboard with ARM/Intel Y series CPU, option for ThinkPad like keyboard with a track point  This is a great start. I'll almost certainly get one if they address those issues in the next version.
Why do you use a wired mouse ?      Because you can't lose your mouse if it's wired ?
My future  computer
Wow, now I know which laptop to get.
Nice laptop! I want one with swedish keyboard! 😊
well, where is the graphiccards? ;(
This reminds me of a phone that was in development years ago that never happened that ended up being bought out by like Google or Motorola. It was essentially a pin board and you got to chose which modules you wanted. Say you don't care about NFC, but want a better camera. You could pop the NFC module out, and get a better camera module, or bigger memory module and have it take the NFC chip's spot. I fell in love with it and I was devastated when I found out they had been bought out.
if this will became a success within 3 years, they will have problems with 3rd party companies who will make upgrades and replacements parts for their laptops for cheaper price and then their sales for parts will surely decline after that.
Is there any poll or something related that laptop owners wants this modular laptop? Cuz if its below somethinh, you wont get any money
I use an external mechanical keyboard.  If this laptop had a plain cover as an option instead of a keyboard, I'd buy this computer in a second.  That way I could use an external keyboard and set it over where the keyboard goes without accidently pressing keys.
Stopped watching after "USB-C charging". Instant FAIL!
What about a GPU
I'll just <3
I hope they become really successful, they really thought out the design of the laptop
I might customize a pc I need tips it's for drawing
I want it ... but i want it to have a bigger screen, 17.3+ plz!
Don't even start about "manufactures not wanting to do stuff" Lenovo removed nerve sense cooling software in 2018 (which basically gave extra boost to cooling by running fans at more speed), almost all the companies have removed battery limiter (which according to many researches extends battery life) from their bios, intel turned off "undervolting" (low temperatures, more stable performance) due to some bug which was of course their fault. They give up this exclusive feature but once they realize that they have committed blunder by giving more power to end user they are quick to correct themselves by locking the bios altogether!!
Framework is the Anti-Apple company. This is exactly what people want thanks guys!
Dude needs VALIUM
New era's just started 3 weeks ago
Nice at with these type of products, we can help save our Nature and economy.
1:25 that hit, I felt it. The laptop felt it, the universe felt it
this reminds me of those fully upgradable laptops from 10 years ago where the company that made them actually made the GPU upgradable and the CPU upgradable. i don't remember the name of that company though, this does bring me to simpler times though, like how laptops were in the mid 2000's to early 2010's. you could literally upgrade everything: CPU, GPU, Storage, RAM, Networking and communication cards etc. than Apple came with their "unibody" designs and kinda fucked this whole upgradability point up. though first unibody macbooks were still somewhat upgradable: RAM, Storage, Wifi Cards, GPU (i remember that was a thing in the mid-late 2000's before 2nd gen unibody design was released)
Nice laptop,hope the company succeeds ❤️❤️❤️.
Penguin crying in the corner😂😂😂 Understand the joke?
My excitement bubble was burst at no touchscreen option. Otherwise I would jump on it. Seems odd. I'll wait for that option.
I absolutely LOVE the idea!!!!!!
Many years the laptop didn't change, only some performances improved. Now the APC2 changed world's computer future: https://youtu.be/hUULJSsEe6I
If I had this I would be SO happy not to have to upgrade every 2 or so years, I can just buy the parts as I want. There will always be some one who can make a new chassis,  because the motherboard can be put anywhere. There will always be some one who can make a nicer higher refresh rate display. This is amazing, actually. They are essentially off loading the R&D onto the consumer! I have no problem with this. It's amazing. and It shows how strong the potentially free market can be. I want this to survive so bad.
Ok ok ok! I’m sold I’m throwing away the apple laptop and replacing it with this. So much head ache will be gone!
This is a great laptop for i am hearing
I love this but my budget is more on the lines of mounting a raspberry pi on the back of a 10 inch display. I also plan on saving for a steam deck. I do hope this is the future of laptops and technology in general though.
Very exciting!
But can I add an optical drive?
Razer released their Razer Blade 2021 editions where released future ready in January. I mean I can upgrade absolutely everything I could need for the next 5+ years and I am aware that it’s a higher performance machine to fit my needs and an rtx 3090 card in it, but the Razer core provides an external GPU and other peripherals access tool. It also has up to 64gb ram space, and a extra m.2 ssd slot that is available and you can upgrade the one you got so you can get 4tb ssd if wanted. So it’s more expensive but it was bigger news when I saw it from Razer. Also it’s got all the ports for monitor, Ethernet cable, usb, usb thunderbolt that has a hub and core external gpu option.  This looks a lot like something I’m gonna be having the same issue with my electric beard trimmer, to many smaller accessories that tend to get lost over time. The 165hz monitor.   I run into the same feelings as this crew and it’s an awesome device but Razer provided my future ready portable performance needs.  The Video was funny though and good info, so I’ll add a like.
this is something that back in 2010 was called "the future" and its finally here lol. I think there were some prototypes of a modular phones too
Wow great 👍👍👍
I'm f'ing impressed, this thing is awesome, I hope they sell a lot of these!!!
\Interesting but the laptop has an integrated GPU.  Currently I have an old Envy dv 7 I contacted Stardock ( I am interested in playing Humanity) they gave me a recommended config. The Graphic card is a NVIDIA 1650 TI...Now, this ia new game and if the recommended config shows a graphic card almost standard for laptops and this new game just come out needs an obsolete card, what will happen in a year's time? That's why Framework would be interesting but...will there be a processor with a faster graphic card?
Sounds like Project Ara, but for laptops..
This.... This is what I've always wanted...
1.8K Dell employees have disliked this video
i want that in india
20 years in development and we are coming back to express card technology.
Should my Lenovo Thinkpad T520 ever die, I definitely buy a Framework - that is if Linux runs on it.
this is good, a longer obsolescence for our laptops
i dont have the money to buy a laptop but please say they have a donation page cause right to repair is so important before we know it cars will be horrible to repair too
The only thing I don't like here: the case itself. I'm one of those temporal anomalies that want their laptop to be a squared, half-inch thick, black box. Simple, sturdy, utilitarian. Give me that Gateway 2000 type stuff, but it can run Win10/ChromeOS. That's why I've been looking at the Pixlebook Go... Until I noticed the lack of USB-A and/or an SD card slot.  Until someone puts out a decent USB-C flash drive, USB-A is still a must.
How will windows activation on OEM key work on this ?
If this thing had an upgradable GPU I’d be in 1000%
Competitors are going to copy the design. They better trademark it lol
That's a nice laptop
Damn, I wish they had a gaming laptop and something like mxm gpu modules.
I just want to upgrade my ram and storage on my M1😭😭😭😭 is that to much ?
I am buying this
sad it has no external GPU
Almost sold me on it, but lacking in the most important place - gpu
imagine having to upgrade a prebuilt lmao
If they had a GPU option, I'd had already bought one of these.
you still have to go back to THEM to buy components. It would be better if a standard was created similar to desktop PC's where any manufacturer could make components and it would all be compatible. its going in the right direction to be fair.
Me discovering framework: you did it you crazy son of a b!#%$ you did it
Great video
Can I just mention the website? You can pretty much fully customise the computer you order, and if you don’t understand what something is (i.e the difference between wifi standard and vPro, sn750 vs sn850 storage) it tells you in the extensive faq section! It is the most consumer-friendly laptop in terms of spec upgrades I’ve ever seen. I’d love to get one but the laptop I need requires a GPU which this one doesn’t have.
Its too expensive
Remember kids, don't buy apple unless you want them to spy on you.
the way you hold that stresses me out
Glue's cheaper than screws. Denying the user from repairing the product, on the other hand, makes the user buy another product. Welp, I am really hopeful that this concept of a modular, user-repair-friendly laptop really catches on
RIP Dell, we don't feel sorry for you.
Dell be like :  🥺
Yeah, no one has made it elegant and easy to fix yet
you dont actually need a type c plug add on to charge it, you plug in directly to the device and it removes the bulky type c connector sticking out from the side of your laptop when charging..
dude! that is fucking sick, getting one now!
AMD > Intel
In a shellnut, frameworks is based.
@14:32 for best part
Who cares about battery size....if I can replace the battery, that's what's important!
I wish consoles were like this..
I have a Chromebook from years ago, its the only one still working. the dell's charging port broke and the Lenovo fell and the keys didn't do anything. my Chromebook, dispite missing two keys, will probably still work.
man i wish i had money to buy stuff like this
Just bought an M1 Mac for battery life but if I found out about this earlier, would've def considered it.
This is the opposite of Apple
Beautiful.
that truth bomb by alex tho
i hate you for being this creative with your sponcor
I wish I knew this existed. I has allowed to buy any computer.
You can get USB-C magnetic cables...
7:42 I also use a wired mouse. That way I don't have to deal with batteries.
Mic hardware switch, NICE!!
Does anyone know where I can invest? And/or are they selling shares
Think I've found my next Ubuntu Studio laptop.
Amazing!
Run MacOs on it!
Fantastic and definitely the way it should be for all products.  This should also result in less e-waste.
i love how they advertise hiring with their hardware. It means they're full confident that the product will satisfy the end user, and i respect that and them.
Sounds weird but the extra screws sold me on the product. Just shows how much the team cares about the end user that they even gave replacement screws. Either that or someone on their team is really bad at misplacing screws.
I'm in love, if they make a ~16" version with discreet graphics I will happily pay "Razer" money for it!
Right to repair!
module for a bigger steam library.. does it have a graphic card ? how well would it play AAAs ?
Oy, who can grab some clips and put together why Linus likes wired mice please? I'm a hack at video editing...
no graphic card tho...
F*** Yeah!!! It's about time!!!
ONly 13.5 inch at this time or have I missed something?
some laptops have "bloatware" that can also make your laptop run of the wall or keep it at 50% so you don't have to go into the bios to do that
Oh wow, those colour-coded screws and spare screws are an absolute godsend. I remember once accidentally bricking my laptop's keyboard because I'd put a screw in the wrong place. Full kudos to the designers, they absolutely deserve a raise for that alone.
Give me an all black version pls 🙏🏼
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, F**k yes! start shipping to the UK, lets go, dont waste time, lets do this, take my money!
Im not a hater, i love your work, i like your content, but please, dont hold that laptop like that
Can we stop making thin laptops?
This is very good. We need more modular laptop!
I really want to see more devices (of all kind, not only PC's Laptops, even Smartphones) be made more with customer being able to access it.   I just love old technology for its accesibility - its much easier to repair something old than new.  like things just as simple as removable laptop battery - ur battery is dying? no problem no need to send it for repair, just release the lock, read the model number, order, put it in. not even a screwdriver required.   today you often need special screwdrivers with weird screw heards that nobody has a way to open, and just stuff like replacing a hard drive is painful.   same with phones, u could just open them up and have access to battery, sd and sim card slots at once, now u just have these weird trays u need a special pin to open. i loved that when you could just pry the case open with your finger nails, to for example take out the battery for a second if the phone froze up, now you have to either wait till it runs out of battery power and shuts down, or take if for repair.    I really hope more stuff will be possible to be self-serviced by customer with just the basic knowledge.
it would be awesome if they had a module that allowed you to connect more modules to it, like a USB hub. instead of buying some offbrand one i would feel more comfortable to buy one directly from Framework.
but you wont be able to upgrade the monitor? lmao
I don't know anything about the bios/motherboards used ,temperatures or the QUALITY of the screens but there was ONE bit of false marketing. They claim great user ability and LONG LASTING but do not put their words where their mouth is and only a 1 year warranty.If they are so sure of longevity i would expect 3 years which USED to be the standard before the industry started ripping us off pushing the 1 year standard so that retailers can charge you extra for longer coverage.
They should make a gaming laptop
Si i looked up these  Laptops at Framework and can get a bit expensive.The decent Laptop i wanted is around 1800 plus appparently 400-450 duty taxes plus regular provincial taxes.So it;s likely costing around 2500.I haven't checked around enough to know in todays market if that is a fair price for an upper middle line Laptop in Canada. So the prebuilds don't look good enough and use built in graphics.So that is why i did the build your own version.The screens however are all 13.5 not good enough as i am used to a 16 inch screen. So they need more options to get the laptop you want.They are also working on preorders which means they are a struggling business only building these or having them built AFTER they get your deposit albeit only a 100 dollar deposit.No word yet on how the shipping is going for the early bird orders.
I agree that looks like a well designed Laptop...how much is the price comparison ..lol.
Omg this was the dream 😍
I actually still have my old Lenovo laptop from 2016 that still runs pretty well. And I opened it up a few times to see what I would need in order to upgrade it, and it was surprisingly easy to figure out.
When disassembling something I have always thought why dont they use screws. Why the glue? Why the plastic clips? PS So many broken plastic clips!!!
One of the reasons that I like desktops is the upgradability, now also easily done by a laptop that's really cool :-)
Why "activate windows" was showing up in the screen? Did it come without OS ?
12:42 stuff like Linus specifically mentioning Linux drivers for the fingerprint sensor is the reason why LTT is the only tech channel I watch anymore. :)
did i understand correctly, no amd cpu/apu?
I’ve seen people use a board with an outline to show where to replace screws-colors will make it easier. Do you take a photo of circuit board before removing screws?
Do dey ship to Mexico? I want one.
Apple lovers : "But it is hideous !!!!"
THIS IS TOOO HOT WHY NOT AVAILABLE IN MY REGION
Brilliant
It is totally Christmas time for Linus
I checked out the site. Seems super neat, the only downside is that I don't see anything with dedicated graphics cards. If they would implement that, then this would probably skyrocket into oblivion.
Modular is advertised as easy-to-repair or upgrade..... But it really means proprietary and overpriced.
Pulsating RGB clear shell laptop when?
very comprehensiveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee review and youve got them ideas from Linus himself...  👌👌👌
No thanks to touch screen on a laptop. It's not a tablet. So that is a plus in my book to the Framework laptop.
Linus can you talk more about the company and if you ever bought the laptop would love to see more in-depth opinion on both laptop and the company
I do wish you hadn't gone for the goofy all clear keyboard for this review.  A good shot of the keyboard layout is always welcome in a laptop review.  Yeah show off the all clear keyboard and say it's cool and whatnot.  Just please make a habit of giving a nice 2 or 3 second shot of the keyboard layout, upright and without much glare on it.  Not even manufacturers do this!  They take all these artful pictures of the laptop from the back corner, and of fake photoshopped in post graphics on the screen, and a nice closeup detail of the webcam, but not the frickin keyboard.
Yay cabled mouse squad. I'll be a Razer Deathadder fan boy for a long time.
Power on AC attach can let you reboot your laptop remotely like it was a desktop machine by power cycling using a remote power switch, like an Alexa module that plugs into a wall outlet.
WHAT GPU LINUS?!!!
Apple: We dont do that Its for saving the earth
Louis Rossman is crying happy tears at this
"The Dell's not even f*cking thinner" is my favorite moment
This is too good to be truth. What the catch?
I REALLY wish I was in the market for a new laptop because that looks amazing. I'd prefer an io module that had a built in hub so I could have more than 4 ports (they look wide enough for 2 USB A ports), and a 360 degree hinge with a touch screen, but that's about it
Lenovo's ideapad the way to go to, I purchased an upgradable gaming laptop.
Oh no, I just bought a new Laptop a year ago....
I want one. Amazing!
How annoying is this guy handling and hitting tech stuff in all of his videos. In a world full of inequalities in terms of access to technology and the level of consumerism of some first world countries behave in this way it looks so disrespectful.
Do you think you could build me a really good gaming pc that I can run rocket league and fortnite really well. My budget is 50$ right now
Gosh I want one. Looks nice, upgradeable so I can save on upgrades, AND it's portable?????????????????????????  Framework is doing the work of the gods right now.
Looks cool. Unfortunately I'm still going to have to buy a macbook because of the OS.
This sounds great, definitely gonna check them out if I want to buy a notebook!
Does... Linus buy segues to sponsors? I don't think that's how it works
"You can just turn the battery off." My Lenovo Legion has an option to stop the battery from being charged to 100% by putting a charging cap at 60%, meaning that once you unplug the charger, your battery will be at 60% and have 40% less battery life before it must be recharged again. It claims that this is an optional feature to keep the battery from overcharging and getting ruined over time, but is that accurate, or does it not make much of a difference?
“Not this one” he says as he has ptsd flashbacks to the razer
I am very interested in this and good video.
I need this so bad!!!! Please get worldwide shipping!! I'm sold just take my money already!
I want one
AND that would help to save the environment too. I hope they accept old parts back to recycle.
adele promised us repairability? huh
I usually don't comment o videos, but i had to show the engineers who designed and manufactured the laptop know that I really appreciate their work. Keep up the good work guys !!! Hope you guys will also sell gaming laptops in the future :)
He know whats hes doing, but my god the way he shakes and wacks it makes me tense up DX
Now install Linux on it.
Why does Task Manager indicate that I have 4 memory slots with only 2 in use when my laptop only has 2 SODIMM slots.
“2010 looking POC”….and I think some of that stuff can look good.
The only thing I want now is a laptop with like 85 of those ports
After specing this machine out with zero components it's not all that impressive in terms of value. I mean maybe long term as you swap out parts but up front no.
Right to repair, YESSSSSSSS! 😁
Great concept but it seems the built quality is .... I would have preferred an aluminium casing. My MacBook pro is getting old, if I can have a test drive of this product and like it then I'll switch
If I had need for a laptop, I'd so buy this 100% thank got for company's like this
Imagine a external GPU as a module in future. That would be awesome !!!!
That's amazing
The absurd debtor resultantly extend because smell tribally scream beyond a questionable golf. abrupt, quixotic dress
Having Linus Torvalds compliment your unix is equivalent to Linus Pauling complimenting your temper
This supports my stance on technology:  "Fuck Apple"
Your quote is on the official website!
This is awesome, and a real step forward. But there are already many repairable and upgradable laptops out there if you don't want the most extreme thin machine.  My Asus TP41OU from 2018 is pretty good, while on holidays in Taiwan I was able to take it apart and install a 2tb SATA HDD into the machine to store all my photos and videos, also the battery is easily replaceable along with the keyboard.  But getting to the ram and SSD was more of an issue as it's either under the motherboard or soldered to the board.  Also many businesses grade HP, Dell and Lenovo laptops are very repairable.
he almost dropped it xD
I wish these guys would make work stations laptop next.
Please framework, don't break and continue making framework laptops and I'm going to buy one when my current laptop gets old!
This is what I've wanted for years now! I really hope it catches on in big, big... viral video kinda way so that they become firmly established and then I hope they don't allow corruption to infiltrate their business. Because I want one and I want it to be around doing what I want it to do for a long, long time.
I look forward to see potential GPU integration. Internal or External.
15:05 the new linus meme face
Linus  got a crazy Q and A for you need to know where these days i can get a oil pc kit know its way late look cool any help would be cool
11:33 dude it was amazing I was seriously watching this then it made me laugh which was my best laugh in that day xD
11:55 Nice void meme guys, now I can't sleep due to Linus' demons screech 😐
I could not see, but it looked blank. But did that keyboard panel have lettered and numbered keys?
And they cost the same as regular laptops. Holy shit, wow.
If it had 2 nvme ssd slot instead of one It will be perfect.
Good one brothers, finally greed does not have to be the norm!  Come on 2022!
amazing... now water-cool it!
Crony capitalism and the intentional lack of government oversight to protect consumers (thanks GOP) has led to the horrific state of planned obsolescence in our current consumer electronics industry. I wish I had known about Framework before I purchased my crappy HP laptop last year. I have been looking for this kind of thing for half a decade.
11:55
If I hadn't just spent all my money on a car I would buy one.
11:56 Lionus Messi scoring a ultimate goal!!!
After this video how long did it take framework to stop accepting preorders lol
I want this so bad, make an AMD version or ARM and I will buy it asap.
Take the venerable Thinkpad chassis and build an upgradable format around it.  Nothing is better than a design that is reliable.
Love the upgradability, but to me it looks like it's a tough sell with the macbook air out there with such a good price/performance ratio.  If the quality proves to be up to snuff though I think there will be a big market for those needing lots of ram and storage, like devs that run a lot of vm's jus as barebones
"What a diagnostic nightmare that is"                                                                                                                                     -linus
No MXM makes me sad.
Great respect for the modular design... please allow the shipping for Germany.  one question though, what about a gaming graphic card?
Never gonna own any apple product till their walled garden approach subsides.
He handles that laptop and all the extra components like my 'wine enthusiast' Aunt handles her 3rd child... r/maybemaymaybe
I wish they also made smartphones... An upgradable framework smartphone would be so nice
At 4 minutes and 15 seconds into the video, I was already looking for the website to buy one.    Apple, Asus and pretty my every other Laptop Manufacturer seriously needs to look at this and learn.
Just they have to add Thunderbolt to it
This is the way.  Ordering one right now too! Still running a 2013 macbook air with no problems because apple hasn't upgraded the macbook air storage enough in the last 8 years. Was trying to hold out for the 2022 new macbook air launch. Only upgrade I've done to my 2013 macbook air is replace the battery myself in 2019. Framework can have my money because their entry level build is the same price as a macbook air in CDN. Thanks for the review! I hope Framework makes a lot of money and this becomes the standard for laptops.
Even the connector to add the expansion modules is a standard connector..  I have no use for a laptop besides the one I have from work... but I kinda want to buy this out of sheer principle
If they make Anime keyboards, like Linus said, that alone would be a really good selling point.
This is beautiful.
Too bad their production line is slow so everything is booked until September or October, if you order now you gotta wait for weeks if not months. Great expectations though. Definitely going to order soon!
why  they are not allowing optane intel as the cache
This is amazing and according to their site the C ports are USB4 with of course the A expansion card topping out at 3.2. The current storage expansion is also 3.2. The video at least to me made it seem like the ports weren't 4. Thunderbolt notwithstanding. I'm also sad the default isn't touchscreen. Lastly I'd rather the headphone jack be just another module, especially since it looks that side only has one slot.
Where’s the NIC expansion module? Or right, they don’t have one. 😢
U use a wired mouse it it doesn't run out of power in the middle of something? ;)
I’m not in the market for a new laptop right now but god damn do I wish I was
By the looks of it, these laptops are unfortunately going to be useless for gaming as there seems to be no discrete graphics card, no options for graphics when building on their site, and no space for a discrete card in the case. Which means that you're stuck with whatever integrated/onboard graphics the chip has. Also would be useless for video editing and other GPU-intensive tasks.  That's a shame. Perhaps Framework could create a second line later on specifically made for gaming, with discrete and interchangeable graphics modules, a 16:9 display panel (most games expect widescreen and this would also widen the case, to make room for the graphics card), resolution options up to 4K, and various RGB options through the case and keyboard (because of course).
honestly this shows that the major companies don’t care about the end user or the product experience, just the money. these guys come in and make a completely upgradable laptop all in the name of user for so much less money
BUT CAN IT GAME
why no amd?
Motherboard interchangeable?
Yaaaassssss! Finally! I wants one!
They need to make a special limited Louis Rossmann edition of this laptop.
That thing looks very much like my dell xps from 2015 on the inside...
If they make a gaming laptop I’ll buy it in a heartbeat.
I am on the edge of my fucking seat Linus is holding it with one hand without the shell and I'm so scared
Linus watches anime?
Why not have more parts replaceable? like the screen and lets call it a "CPU module" and a "GPU module" (which would still be soldered on, but replaceable)...  so you can switch out some ports here and add small SSD, so what
The only issue is that, despite being largely modular, you still have to buy from them so it doesn’t stop them overcharging for simple components
Apple does R&D to make stuff more difficult to fix and upgrade :D
Hem project ARA next level
I hope there are camera/screen upgrade options...like 4k display, 4k camera.  Are the discreet GPU options?
if you love building pcs this laptop is for you and not just me anyone can do this thats the beauty of this
this is incredible
but, can it run crisis?
yeah, I love this concept forever since Acer released an upgradable Laptop back in 2008? Haven't seen it since... and I've lost that laptop. But this I amazing.
Consider this: Why buy a renewable computer for a few thousands, when I can buy a NB that is more than good enough for 80% of everything for under $1,800, and have it repaired orjunk it.
Do YO think YOU are more credible if YOU wave YOUR hands all over the place. Ask a Dr. You are going to become, "Overstimulated". Wait until YOU have YOUR first heartattack beforeyoub are 45-55. Good-luck.
Amazing planning and design by the engineers. Can't believe it's 2021 and we're only just seeing this level of design.
Really wish there was an affordable Micro center analogue in Japan.
I hope more companies go direct to consumer with better pricing then the big  online sellers so they can get more of the profits then say Amazon.
All you plebs, drooling over an upgradable computer that you can carry around. I just made a backpack for my desktop. When I walk into the library, people stare in awe of how intuitive I am. It definitely isn't because I'm drenched in sweat. Plebs
well my laptop is 7 years old and it does not have 180 degree movement so whenever i see him turning that display it makes me anxious
if i didn't already have a pretty rad MSI laptop i would totally buy one of these. i love everything about it. one question i have that didn't seem to be addressed, what are the GPU options if any?
I got the headset! Thank you, LTT!!!
Fully modular laptop with hardware kill switches for camera and microphone?  Wow, there must be a god lol
Is there any product roadmap or launch schedule of framework's future product?   Looking forward to have AMD-based news, AMD CPUs consume less power.
So COOL. A stem kids dream! But like also a non stem kids dream because you can fix your own laptop without being a techlord
*sees thumbnail Ah yes, I must get this usb-c port to plug into this usb-c port!
its difficult to watch Linus treat that computer as a pornstar treats a penis during a BJ in a porno...
In regards to that small lip on the bottom of the case, my counter would be that this company doesn't have the sheer financial clout to weed out every tiny flaw. Just imagine what they could do with the amount of money dell or apple have though
Outstanding video about what looks like an outstanding product. You didn't talk about warranty? Is there a warranty or is that somehow against the point of a device like this?
Apart from their own silicon, I still fail to understand how apple spends billions on their designs 🧐
I mean, I love the included QR codes, but I've got dodgy internet so would really appreciate a physical manual as well 😅
"There should be other options."  There are other options... your entire video is about another option... right to repair, applied to iPhones, means we don't get iPhones anymore.  Not that I want an iPhone; I absolutely do not, but I don't want you taking that option from me in favor of bulkier easier to repair phones.
This is AWESOME!!!!!!!
my laptop is somewhat modular btw
BBBeeeee SSSS
Can't wait for Apple to bribe tech companies to not work with this brand
So I know you want to invest in this company and had concerns about the imaging. Why not create a "ad prize" program that manufacturers can earn and give this company the first one with a massive ad award added to it. Like a ton of free advertising and featuring when a company does something like this right. Then you can award it to any company that actually does something on this level of consumer friendly. Make it clear this is an incentive for companies to do things RIGHT. Like the Linus techtips x-prize.
Awesome, I just found my next laptop.
I would love to see you guys break down the MNT Reform. It's an open source Linux machine that can be fully disassembled as well. ^^
This is fantastic and I want one... But I want one with a GPU, and i want one with an AMD cpu, and I don't mind if it's a little thicker, and in fact I'd prefer a 17" model.  If I had those options, I'd be buying it right now too.
I hope they include a (thinkpad style) trackpoint keyboard
The first thing I would replace would be...arrows - full size arrows as I used tem for the last 50 years !
But how would it handle being used as a gaming laptop?
We will watch their career with great interest.
Please make a follow-up video after about a month's use. That would be awesome!!
This is Snowden's new PC everything can be disconnected and changed out
I'm halfway through the video and I can firmly say, this laptop and the company that makes it is BASED.
Can it run beamng drive
@Framework if another company offered to buy your company for a lot of money, would you sell?
If anyone ever asks me about laptop now... I'm directly going to them now, and I have laptops due to the lack of upgrades
i love how exited he gets over such simple quality of life things, and i feel exactly the same way
I was skeptical when Framework were first advertising this product in my Linux podcasts but they slowly convinced me and I'm shocked it actually looks better than expected! Wow! They definitely listened to feedback and had the right idea to begin with
"Performant" god have mercy
This is just big boys LEGO :D
Looks like laptop I've been looking for. You didn't mention the GPU in it though?
Did Linus really hook up the WiFi antennas the wrong way around?
No AMD Ryzen? :(
Intel-only is a deal-breaker for me...
At this point I wish I was into and had a use for laptops. They've just never been my thing. With that said, this is freaking amazing.
17:00 perfect
Would love to see that laptop coming to Europe ... and with amd cpus :)
I am so happy to see this
I have no use for a laptop but if they make a modular phone I’d buy that shit.
When did Asmongold start a tech channel
I am sold if it has a replacable gpu.
11:34 Best moment ever
Linus I am a huge fan I really feel like having a similar profession as you. You inspire me keep it up with the hard work because I always enjoy it
does it have rj-45 gig eth port?
Dude this is amazing! If companies like HP and Apple catch up on this... They are gonna get so many more customers...
Imagine a world where these bits become a industry standard. You like apples touchpad, plug it in. Prefer WD over Samsung, swap em out. Like we have with stationary pc. A dream oh so sweet.
did i miss the part where he tells what gpu or at least how powerful it. and the temps?
It really won't last any longer than other laptops because you cant upgrade cpu or gpu. Repairability is a plus, sure.
Only 3 Screws for my Dell :-P
I feel case makers could easily implement this standard for front IO expansion. The 5" external bay is practically dead and buried because it takes up so much space, so being able to compactly expand IO at the cost of a few USB headers make sense to me.
The DELL bit got me
I think most ppl wouldn't dare to take a Laptop apart... even this one. Seems like a "small" target audience here
Hackintosh?? Anyone have any ideas if this could become a source for Hackintosh laptop once they release a risc chip?
They DON’T have an ethernet port module 💀
I had a Lenovo y510p. Which had a revolutionary ultra Bay slot for potential sli, day 1 nvidia didn't even support it. Any laptop with interchangeable or upgradable GPUs that are nvidia will NOT be supported by nvidia. So be warned nvidia fan boys. Your company is trash. AMD would never pull a garbage move like that. Their software and driver support takes a nasty dukie on nvidia.
No Ethernet yet though. This brings sad
That's funny, I've been to toying with the idea for a laptop case/dock that uses USB-C and external SSDs to provide a shit ton of modular storage. I'm glad to hear it's actually a good idea.
No you goat!
Why do the USB-C expansion cards not have two ports? Seems like it would fit just fine. (Maybe not so much for USB-A, but two ports there would be great too)
Linus is happy with small companies caring for Customers. And so am i.
after watching lot of LTT videos my conclusion is... the way linus handle things seems like he will breaks everything lol
I'm starting to equate Linus's adverts to being Rick rolled
The concept is great, but if to consider as a gaming laptop. The heating and graphic power are limited.  Great work station but the market for this is not that big if only for a work station...
I REALLY hope there will be a detachable (not only foldable) in 13.5" (or higher) from framework.   sth. like surface book, so with a "real" keyboard and not such things like in a surface pro.  BTW. I really like the DIY possobility. Great!
Just wish they weren't so heavily focused on the US market. How hard would it be to send some EU/International power supplies, and I would rather take a blank keyboard layout than anything else.
this is actually really really cool
wasnt tbe dell alienware upgradable?
Love the idea and unit itself but prices seems a bit steep.  To swap the i5-1135G7 for i71165G7 +300$. Or +700$ for the i7-1185G7. If you look at the recommended customer price on ark.Intel the i7s variants are only 100$ up from the i5.  For the most basic "build your own" i5, 1x8GB RAM and 250GB NVMe you are already at *1021$* (882$ without OS).  If you take the system with no RAM, storage, OS, Wifi they start at 750$, 1049$ and 1449$.  In Norway I can currently get a laptop with the i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM, 500GB storage and W10 Home (and *5yr warranty*) for about the same price as the cheapest option (1000$) from Framework.  As I said I love the idea, but at these prices it will be hard to choose this over a better specced PC (with 5yr warranty). Not that it really matters since they dont take orders from Norway.
The thing itself costs one thousand dollars. I’m out of this bs.
Legit hope they make a gaming laptop that's modular and sexy as this!
He siad it, he wanted to get internal memory got lifted by that 1mb, right? There you go, ex me, what?cuse
What does it cost ? Like sub 2000€ ? Great :)
Want the Vega tho☹️
any idea when theyll start making phones with the same philosophy? you cant even hard reset phones anymore because the battery isnt removable nor is the interior accessable without prying off the screen. i want to be able to change out a camera module, a speaker module, a screen module, a battery module, etc.
This seems great, when my current laptop finally kicks it I’m going to buy one of these
Is there a cellular data attachment???
I have a good idea for a model name: "Theseus."  As in "The Ship of Theseus".  Because if you gradually upgrade each component a little at a time, and in a couple years you've swapped out every component, is it the same laptop?
Fairphone who make a pc (without the fair)
When I have more money, I am supporting this 100%. In their configuration menu, they even have an option for "bring your own" for things like RAM, the WiFi card, and the Operating System, so you can save money if you already have the parts from another laptop, or if you just want to buy your own. Yes, PLEASE!
4:20 look a the laptop play it 20sec before am I the only one
i want a big thick one that uses a desktop amd cpu chip,all laptops should have battery storage voltage preset in a menu
This video needs to be viral. Good job, Framework! i hope that company can grow. i'm pretty sure anyone dislike this videos are from other manufacturers
Nah man, right to repair is about you paying for an item and not being able to fix it. If you have to depend on the manufacturer to fix your stuff, you're leasing it.
Super Awesome product! If I even need a laptop I know what brand to get.
This kind of previously theoretical modular design is something I've only seen on the pixel. And its affordable? Liked for later use.
Only issue I can find is with gamers. If NVidia doesn't want to make a compatible RTX 3060 graphics card or AMD a compatible sized Radeon RX 6700 XT card then there's little hope. For the perfect custom laptop, it would have the same as building your own pc. Designated slots that either adapted for or supported by all major manufacturers.
Not only does Apple not want to but they spend their billions on making their stuff even harder to work on
That's very Insteresting laptop.... My problem is gone if I have a device like that...
LoL, that's neet. How much faster is this laptop vs an archaic YP710 Lenovo...
Louis Rossmann covered this back in Feburary.
Framework should sell empty shells of the adapter modules as project boxes so that someone with an idea, hot glue, and a soldering iron can make one do whatever he wants.
Is the processor and gpu modular? That would be a deal breaker for me
This is the kind of laptop I would buy. I love it. It's such a smart way of using the USB C's bandwidth capabilities to add modular expansion. Instead of having a ton of stupid hubs, the hub's built right in and everything plugs in. On top of how easy it is to service, that's incredible. I really hope this thing takes off well. I saw on their site that they're already selling the like 3rd and 4th batches of systems so that's good to see!
Not shipping to the UK right now. :(  Also, does it have thunderbolt? That would be awesome!
The 7:53 "yeah, cry me a river, Linus" made me laugh so hard.
I so want a larger version of this laptop so I can get a numpad and bigger battery, or posibly gpu?
I can forgive a smaller battery as long as it is replacable. Because the reason i need a battery that gets me trough 2 days is, I want to get trough a day when only 80% of the capasity is left. Also longer life if you don't need to drain it to 0.
This is the kind of future all tech should aspire to be like, sooner or later it will happen anyway due to enviromental reasons, imagine cellphones like this, cameras...
10:50 I see your point linus, you can upgrade many laptops that are on the market. BUT (not counting ram) usually its quite difficult to do so and very easy to damage some other component that is in the way. The framwork laptop makes the whole upgrading and repairing process super easy and convenient.
Bro no GPU and I'm paying 1200$ for a decent laptop + some more taxes ? No not worth it to be honest.
Google aria blackbacks
I hope they start offering in the EU really soon. The legislation over here is going in the direction of a serious right to repair. If Framework has a good standing by then, they will be kilometers ahead of everyone else.
If I'm a millionaire I would definitely invest in this company
I think that there is more to love here than simply the ability to upgrade.  There is a LOT to be said for ease of repair, which this laptop has in spades.
I love the fact that when you take the back off, the inside of the laptop "welcomes" you with oodles of text and useful information.   It's like they were just waiting for you to take it apart.   😍😍😍
Good idea but not great for main PC due to lack of graphics card. Any info as far as that goes?
Just bought one
i want one
Is it good for gaming?
Finally a "Modular" laptop! 'Bout time! If they succeed we are on our way for a better, less wasteful future (in the event that they have a recycling program in place for the old modules). On a side, note there are already community guides for Linux distro's, I'm sold! Note to future self: Don't have beer beside my my next Frame.work laptop!
Jeez. I'm between computer upgrades cycles. I would love to but something right now to support this company
What about the screen? Is it usable for graphic design, photo, video?
I would like to see a review and comparison to Purism's Librem 14 laptop. Purism didn't do the gimmicky (IMHO) USB-C I/O modules, but their laptops have similar privacy and user-repairability baked into their design. And given they've been around longer, I have a little bit more faith in their long term prospects.  For Framework, I'm concerned that as soon as a new USB spec is dropped, you'll need to upgrade the motherboard (and CPU/GPU) to take advantage of it, as well as buying the newer faster I/O modules. The cost of that kind of upgrade is likely to be akin to just buying a new laptop anyways, and produce a similar amount of e-waste unless Framework somehow manages to create a secondary market for obsolete used parts.
Now they just need to add a firewire expansion card
This guy suffers from childish ADHD or he just sniffs cocaine before every filming?
Imagine having Linux on this beast... Modern dig tough book
I just got mine this weekend and I have to say so far I'm  thrilled with it from everything to the near 100% compostable cardboard packaging to the smoothness of the assembly (I got the DIY version), OS install and driver install.  If you're thinking about a new laptop definitely look into this one.  Having replaced the entire upper keyboard+trackpad bezel on a Mac PowerBook for example, this is a breath of fresh air.
I would like to see a AMD setup as i am a linux user and this would rock with it! As i like to game in linux and more the intel side of things is lost when you compare AMD and linux! If they get to that area i would jump on and buy one!
Lol my parents have been using the same asus laptop since 2010 and refuse to change even though they hate it because it’s so slow. The fun thing is they bought a laptop for my little sister in 2019 but refuse to get a laptop that is decent for themselves.
I wish the CPU was socketed, I remember an old laptop I had that I upgraded to a faster processor. Wish we could have that again
I understand the appeal, but if you look for sales you could get a similar spec'd laptop for less than half (even if you bought a cheaper SSD and RAM from somewhere else).  You are also hoping this company is around in 3-5 years when you want to upgrade.
...with only integrated GPU. I would buy one if it could be shipped with, saying, GTX/RTX - ideally swapable. But just for "business use".... not today, sorry. However, the idea is still great.
Watch Apple come outta nowhere be like: "Our new MacBook pro comes with 'Imod Technology'! A brand new, never before seen, and innovative solution for users who want to personalize their heavily regulated apple experience!"
If I wanted a windows laptop I’d 100% get this but unfortunately Mac OS just works better for my needs. Wish apple did this.   I feel like If they were happy to manufacture a thicker case they’d be able to fit desktop CPUs in there, could be good for people that want a more powerful laptop now. Or make motherboards with different CPUs soldered to them directly.   I feel like they need to become a board partner with either AMD or Nvidia to stand any chance of this taking off properly, get some specialised GPU cards for it that would be the bomb
These laptops are amazing. They would be a great fit with an egpu.  Sadly they do not have a german keyboard layout D:
Oh snap, now i totally want one....
is the GPU upgradable?
@1:58 is anyone surprised to see that Linus' phone has been dropped quite a lot??? I for one am not
This would oversell with Windows in it at India.. Asia… Eurasia. Even though I would use Pop!_OS
i need at least a 17" monitor . get to wrk guys ;)
remember the good ol days when a new os came out and no drivers would wrk. i still have an ROG that came with win 8 but i put win 7 on it and nothing would wrk. i had to go back to win 8.  but  dose this comp have the same issue? i will never go to any windows os after win 7.  i have too much windows brain dmg to use linux but one day ill learn it or it too will be taken over by the one wold sys
I commend this company, this needs to be done, stuff is getting more locked down and disposable! Imagine the flexibility of a desktop in a laptop. Just makes sense
So basically this PC could fit the definition of Hardware as a service ?
wow O_O
Cool
Hell... just bought 2 finaly a laptop I can upgrade! Hell YEAHHHH!!!
How nice if battery is in the middle, motherboard is at left and right. And they could have more space to design slot in ssd, graphic cards, even processor in future. Because battery outdate is slower then the rest.
I can't justify buying another laptop right now, but I would love to support these guys in the future if/when they start offering higher performance desktop replacement style models with dedicated GPUs.
Wait wait wait wait wait if they actually do collabs with other brands and stuff, that would be the most fucking amazing thing. yes yes yes *PLEASE*
I priced one, it's $3,300 with everything.
what about Keyboard button's labelling, Linus????
I love how Linus is so excited about this.
The only "problem" i see there is no GPU in them :(
Wondering what score ifixit would give it
ok, next step, Gaming Laptops with upgradable GPU
remmeber kids piracy is legal 100% :)
This looks amazing. If they make a version with a mid-range GPU at some point, it would easily replace my current laptop
Props to whoever is doing those silly visual edits. Prime meme material.
0:12 "2010 looking piece of crap", proceeds to show a 1990s looking laptop. Hey, Linus, your privilege is showing again mate.
Seriously looking for this type of product for a decade :)
i am freakin pumped about this laptop 750 DIY E awesome
I bet you both bottom corners of Linus' laptop are bend downward from being held out by one hand.
Its cool, but I can get a 11th gen i7 on a Acer swift 5 with 14" touch screen and 1kg weight for < USD $999 here where I live.  I cant see any laptop beating this even with the future upgradability. Besides, I am not sure I want to be stuck on 11th gen in 3 or 4 years when I might want an upgrade.
It's kinda funny how something you would've taken for granted just a decade ago is now considered an outstanding feature.
Add a 144Hz display and a 6 or 8 core CPU and I'm sold
anyone know if this laptop is good? its 950 dollars. ASUS TUF Dash 15  (2021) Ultra Slim Gaming Laptop, 15.6” 144Hz FHD, GeForce RTX 3050 Ti,  Intel Core i7-11370H, 8GB DDR4, 512GB PCIe NVMe SSD, Wi-Fi 6, Windows  10, Eclipse Grey Color, TUF516PE-AB73
My only concern is... Does it come in black?
just glad to see linus w/o a mask on
I would definitely be into it for an ARM or RISC-V motherboard in the future.  Personally I have a big powerful desktop I built, and I'm a Linux guy, so having a portable machine with enough grunt to run VNC would do.
FINALLY a laptop I can get behind
Hell, I can't afford it, but I'm a fan!
1) It does not exist (pre-orders only). 2) Prices are around 2x third party (same pricing philosophy as Apple).
// Just waiting for these to ship to middle europe.  THIS is really what we need..
If the Laptop is charged with an USB-C-Port, I'm currentzly using one round USBV-C-Plug, that magnetically connects with it's cable, and since I got options for Micrto-USB as well, I pretty muchg hitted my other Devices with the compatible connector., so the SwitchPro-Comntrollöer charges with a magnetic cable and my PC-Controller does the same as do my cheap Tablet, Hand-Ventilator, my Moms Scanner for her Diabetes, her Phone as well,  and my small Bluetooth-Speaker.  And when I accidently connect my SwitchPro-Controller with my PC, my PC does recognize it.  Edit: Link for the Typa of Cable I'm talking about https://www.amazon.de/dp/B081D6RTT7
Great, so instead of carrying dongles/adapters, now you gotta carry a bunch of modules. And it really isn't a gorgeous computer, only to a geek like Linus.
went to the website to order 10 for the company.. only wants to sell me 1.
If this doesnt blow up I'll be very dissapointed. we need more solutions liek these. edit: regarding QR codes on the slots may not be the best solution, as all things on internet that dont make their way to "wayback machine" tend to dissapear for good. just looking for drivers on a system that's 5 years old is already a chore as tech is moving way too fast, and new solutions come in. so a tangible manual would still be great,
This thing is amazing! It is repairable and doesn't even slightly compromise on functionality. This is proof that tech companies have no excuse to make their laptops hard to repair.
12:45 > features Linux drivers  *cough* DELL! *cough*  (as an owner of a Dell laptop that was sold with Linux but without any fingerprint reader support written for Linux)
There is nothing written on the keyboard?
1:55 https://www.fairphone.com/en/ : Hold my beer.
Why is he acting like this? Is this some sort of childish channel or something?
I don’t use my old laptop anymore even tho it’s high end the charge port went out on it and just don’t need it but this is the future and it’s about time. Hope to see this in other Products like stereos and such. Added this to my buy list
Would be so cool to get one of these and turn it into a hackbook / hackintosh as a big F U to Apple.
Why don't have the Graphic Module for DIY model ?   Their is more important that in DIY laptop.  Framework should be consider it!
One bit for the screws is something else.
Definitely a lot of potential in a configurable device such as this one. However, it's not for everyone. I, for example, am an aspiring concept artist. A touch screen with pen compatiblity (the way I like to draw is with a direct pen-to-screen workflow) would be much appreciated. If, somehow, the guys at Framework manage to make a device similar to a Surface Pro (my current laptop), I'd buy it without hesitation.
Waiting for price
This and the fairphone my next two devices.
Linus, let's discuss about what phone would be a worthy successor of our Galaxy Note9
Is there any chance for a gaming benchmark episode of this unit?
could just buy a thinkpad though lol
There was gateway who had removable processors. They used Desktop processors.
Me who just wants to play osu
11:56 thank me later
This is some of the coolest tech I've seen in ages. Very exciting. I don't need a new laptop, but it's tempting.
First of all, I don't give a **** that it looks like a 2010 bulky looking thing, if it's fixable, i'll get it.
Wow Linus not having a bad thing to say about something he is reviewing is MIND blowing 🤯
Remind me of google modular phone that got cancelled. Will this be successful? Stay tuned in the next episode of dragon ball
Uhm, the real reason internally for all the laptop manufacturer for their design choices: COST :-P (10 Million devices, 10 cents cheaper production => 1 Million $/€ more money)
Honestly, with thunderbolt 4, a USB-C hub, an eGPU and some cable ties you can do amazing things these days. Laptops seem perfectly upgradable already to me.
Too much work buy a apple laptop or Dell
Basically a r/unixporn taken to hardware level. GREAT!
For the first time in 20 years I didn't throw up in mouth thinking about replacing my t400. If this comes with a non proprietary bios im gonna jizz in my pants.
Why the keyboard looks so ugly?
Aight I’m convinced. I’m saving my cash. I haven’t had a laptop because I don’t care, but now I do!
it's been a while since Linus has honestly been so excited about something like this.
Please... make a 15 or 17 inch version, I will almost certainly buy it.
It is simply NOT possible, at least if you want an quality product that delivers. This one doesn't, so back to the drawing board...
Wow the QR codes had me.. that's so user friendly.
So can I upgrade the CPU like I can in my current laptop? How about the GPU? Oh wait, both of these features were already available but so not cost affordable that no one bothered to upgrade GPUs or CPUs in laptops when the parts cost a fortune, sometimes even more than desktop parts. AAaand no, CPU is soldered here... so... not upgradeable. There are still laptops with socketable CPUs. Would rather get that.
Screw those proprietary expansion blocks, I will happily gut any laptop and use a classic NVMe or SATA instead. Just give me regular standardized ports. If they want to offer plenty of USB-C go ahead but don't make them these stupid expansion blocks that can probably only be bought at great cost from manufacturer of the device as long as they are in business.
We are back to game cartridges
Eventually.
6:03 big fat steam library xd yeah, 1tb is like 5 games nowadays xd
Well done framework
Great for ‘repairability’ but unfortunately the mobo cannot be upgraded
I have no need for this but I think I'm buying one on principle.
11:56 youre welcome.
Think y'all can do a review for linux compatibility? Like an actual installation of something?
love the design and look
Maybe I missed it but what operating system are they running?
Does the Framework Laptop support Thunderbolt 3/4?
This is freaking amazing.
I love this! I want one! Is there a gaming version one with graphics card I can upgrade later? I'm currently using a ASUS m580vd-eb76.  I used to have a tower PC, but I need the portability for my job so this laptop right now does wonders for my job and my gaming addiction lol. Would be great to be able to upgrade my laptop or replace parts when needed instead of tossing it to the trash...
Gaming laptops exist now..
THE DELL'S NOT EVEN F***ING THINNER
Now THIS, is consumer grade quality!
There should be an industry standard form factor for this so that many companies can contibute just like on the desktop.
I hope they post worldwide.
odd that there is absolutely no info on the gpu nothing in this video or on there website :s?
No GPU???
I wish I could get a Danish keyboard on it, and will be looking to buy one when it's time to upgrade my current school laptop that's only 1 year old
What is going on with windows activation. Went back through the video and couldn't find a key but could possibly be one  of the QR code? Really good concept and can appreciate the design and brilliance that went into it. Just wondering about if they are sent with a genuine copy of windows.
Well I know what laptop I'm buying
tbh most people who buy apple (non pro versions) or unless for specific applications like video editing wont buy that they want apple for status and dont even care whats inside or how it works
And once this company gets a little success all the big tech will be forced to this user friendly model which they could do but didn't
holy shit im sold
lol cracked phone
Did I just saw the Gold standard Dell XPS fell off the podium....
plot twist: all the components cost more than the actual laptop, so basically the upgradable laptop is unupgradable 😂
This is exciting! While I'm very happy with my upgrade options on my XPS 15 over my old Thinkpad Yoga, this would have been high on my list if I was looking now. I'll recommend this to anyone looking for a 13" laptop when it makes it to Aus!
That's a tasty looking bento box!
this is close to perfect
finally a company that gets it, definitely going to have a look at this little good-guy when my current laptop gives out.
Funnily enough, Lenovo blocks changing the WLAN module in BIOS - so no, you cannot upgrade. Even though you can physically put the new module inside.
Can we all appreciate for a minute that this isn't a failed Kickstarter company? Countless startups have been founded that promise the earth and accept tens of thousands of dollars in contributions without shipping any actual products that satisfy expectations. Now these guys are hitting so many goals and shipping product before I've even heard of them. My hat is all the way off for Framework.
15" version, and I'm in!
When will it available in Germany?
noice
This is a literal god send. Apple after seeing this: "wait you cant do that shoot him or something"
Reeeeeally thinking of ordering one of these.
God, this is cool!
Whether you can easily replace your battery or not is a big deal, sure. But modular I/O? Why not just use adapters or a USB hub? Too complicated or ugly?
It feels like this laptop came out of the Soviet Union in an alternative reality where it survived
18:26 - coupon for free wireless headphones - must be used in-store…. umm… if we don’t have a store in our state, and can’t travel, what then? 😔
Nice "DELL" vomit. :)
This actually took a dump on all other laptop manufacturers *apppppppppllleeeeeee*
It can handle an Ultrawide or large 4k monitor too?
Finally
Can you give me graphics card 1050 ti atleast to play game 😒
Modular. I've been nagging companies about this for years. This is a brilliant concept. User friendly, builder friendly, and clearly respects user end right to repair. Gotta love it! :)
He definetly tested it's strength throwing it around an all
Gaming versions with swap-able GPU separate from the mainboard would be cool. Pick up where Dell left off.
If they integrate a 360 hinge, and touchscreen with pen input, I'll absolutely buy one. I mean, theoretically this could be the last laptop you ever buy right?  Assuming they make individual components available for replacement/upgrade?
Waiting on the EU shipping and hope this company does well as this is the kind of change we need in the industry a pro consumer approach with rights to repair and customize your device!
no upgrade path for mainboard or gpu? fail...
I haven’t been excited for anything in a year or so. I’m excited about this one. So freaking cool.
You use a wired mouse because latency is better responsive
Want
3:40 oh no they just figured out that all it ever does is google first
this is what it all should be. <3
This guy's too funny, he's being very EXTRA in this one, must have paid him good money for this commercial....
I saw the WAN Show about this. I for one really think Linus should invest in Framework. I think he’s being overly cautious and therefore not maximizing Framework’s opportunity to become a market player.
If Linus himself can do it, I can probably do it too! Wow! This is amazing!
This is super awesome! I just hope they get the colors a bit more dialed in that grey looks tired lol
I want this! With touch option and a 360° turnable screen!!!
I love how he said do whatever the fuck you want💕
The future
Would totally be interested in the second round of their products when I'm in need of a laptop. Cheaper and processor and a touch screen and I would be keen.
Go and buy one
bruh your wrong the original play station had memory thumb drives you would plug into to save game saves on
3:44 YESSIR PATEL REPRESENT
I want one of these...
Project Ara : Laptop
Does any one remember the mega man anime? I am getting battlechip wibs from these adapter/expansion cards.
This is my next laptop purchase. This was the best review I have seen in years; I really want this laptop! Edit: Just expensed this laptop! Businesses should only buy this-F the other laptop makers.
Modularity, good for lowering e-waist, bad for capitalism's bottom line. Which is why despite the fact that we have had fast enough ports and standards to be able to do this with everything from mobiles to laptops to tablets, next to none of it is being done at any useful scale. It is simply more profitable to capitalism for you to consume and throw away and repeat.  I wish these people luck nonetheless.
exactly what is needed
This product was made for real enthusiasts… it’s a beautiful concept and I hope it catches on.
Looks amazing, and I love that is uses a 3:2 display, but I'm never buying another laptop that doesn't have a touch screen.  I hope they offer that option in the future because this is looking pretty good.  Also upgradability for a laptop sounds good on paper, but realistically laptops tend to get a lot of wear and tear over time.  A regular $600 laptop can last me 3-5 years with little more than a battery swap, but by then it's looking pretty worn out which doesn't matter since it's usually due to be replaced anyway.  But this I would expect to be able upgrade for 8+ years, and I just don't see it looking nice and being fully functional by the end of that.  It seems like the only benefit to this is really just to save a bit of money by buying parts instead of a new laptop for a couple of generations.  I'm not one of those people who wants to keep old hardware alive and relevant by installing tiny linux or whatever, so maybe this is just not for me.
What amazes Linus: USB C port with a dongle
If it was 500usd or less id buy it right now for my computer engineer uni, ill have to buy a notebook anyways for when normal classes start so yeah, sucks that it is so expensive
How about tablets.
I think you missed the biggest reason today's laptops are non-upgradable or repairable... greed.
I actually put in a job application from this video and the link they put inside the laptop lol
I would love a soundcard expansion for this thing that comes with more audio ports and a better DAC and AMP. If we can stick them in USB sized from factors, we can do it with their expansion cards.
I have skilled hands my dude. Laptops like this wont last because its not cost effective to allow end users to replace and repair components.
I feel like Linus is about to cry in joy several times. What a great product!
I'm actually looking into making a surface magnetic charger addon. Unsure if I can make it work but will try since I have 2 surface devices and magnetic charging has saved my butt a few times with dogs.
How can order this brand? asia for
The fact they even managed to release a product that so consumer friendly just goes to show how much bullshit conventional manufacturers have been peddling.
I've been wanting to upgrade for a few years now and was kind of waiting for decent amd CPUs, but i might just wait another couple of months if it means this will ship to europe 😳
I frigging love this! Should be the new mandatory standard, if you ask me. Also - going to watch Louis Rossmann's video now :)
"im ordering one right now" .. but wait, you already have one?
What the laptop name?
If my XPS13 needed replacement, this is what I’d replace it with.
Cracking review, great product, it should get a government subsidy for environmental sustainment and reuse.
Would buy one when they add Lenovo like trackpoint
The power on when plugged in is quite common in laptop bios.  I do like the battery disconnect when plugged in.
I can see them making a killer gaming laptop that's actually upgradable!
At 13:20 Linus says the motherboard supports touch. No other reviewer has mentioned this (that I have seen). Did this information come from the owners and if so, is there an expected date for a build option with touch screen?
How I wish they are opening orders for singapore
Yea i have Laptop from 2007 and it’s cool how you can pull all the parts out easily
8:18 add this to the Linus Drop Tips compilation
I would love to see the framework laptop used in your other laptop videos moving forward as a comparison of reparability and upgradability. This company could use that kind of passive exposure too.
hopefully they add ryzen cpus in as well. I'll be so down for that
I upgraded my old MSI GE70 with more ram (+8gb), new processor (i7 4700MQ => i7 4930MX), 1 SSD and a new battery. The only thing I could not change was GPU, because it was soldered to the motherboard. And this Framework laptop has soldered CPU + GPU, that means you will have to change the whole motherboard if you want to upgrade the most important parts ... Why did they not put removable CPU / GPU ? Even with specific laptop format / plug (MXM ?). My old MSI had removable CPU, and some Acer / alienware have removable GPU, why not mix ? Being forced to upgrade both at the same time is not the best   And yes, modular IO seems nice, but it's just a detail to me ...  I feel like it's going to be some apple thing : you will have to buy entire new specific and expensive Framework motherboard with soldered CPU / GPU in order to upgrade, nothing else will be compatible and it will end up being just as expensive as a new laptop. I hope I'm wrong.  Idk, it doesn't feel like a "completely" upgradeable laptop, maybe future versions will be more modular, that's when i'll throw my money at them  Edit : I just saw there is only 1 shitty GPU option for now ... Definitely not buying, but in the future when they improve, maybe ? Base idea is good
As soon as they release a iso blank or iso nordic layout I'm ordering one. This hasn't emerged a second to late.
Lenovo T400 laptop case size is ideal to create a standard laptop with replaceable components. If companies adopt it as a standard we can have a laptop with interchangeable components. Laptop main differentiation for me is the power management, the integrated battery.
Shows everybody is frustrated with unrepairable gadgets. Unrepairable thing survives because there is upgrade in technology in every generation products.
That's the Total opposite of the Apple Products Politics !
hey can you make the best pc for sim racing im interested to see what you do.
I hope they start to sell these in EU and I would love a gamer variant.
I think I found my next laptop!
Commenting mostly for the algorithm, really want this thing to take off
Apple: "don't write it down"
Only thing not modular.......HEADPHONE-JACK!! SLAP!! TAKE THAT APPLE and others, except LG ofc.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😎😎
Not in need of a laptop right now or else I might have bought it.  Fck e-waste and fck companies that don't care about the longevity of my devices. That's the reason I also have a Fairphone
Until your headphone jack dies and then you are screwed :D  But yea, how come nobody else is doing this?! Imagine how easy it would be if every laptop was like this...
I will always remember my old Alienware M17 x R3, made in 2012 with it's dated 660M GPU and it's abhorrently loud fans. Played allot of mid range games at low settings on that thing. But what I will always remember was how easily it was to upgrade the thing. It was so big you basically had a micro-tower on your lap, with ever component given a ample amount of room, and independence so it was dirt simple to unscrew, and replace any part. Added an SSD, added a 970M (With a fair bit of coding work to get it to run), and that thing just kept chugging. It's one thing to buy something that works. . . until it doesn't and you're fucked because it's glued together. It's another to buy something that begs you to fix it up, upgrade it and keep it running so you can get that absolute most out of your purchase. I paid 200$ for that laptop used in 2019 as my first computer, and to this day would have paid easily three times that much. It never failed me and I ended up handing it down to a younger brother and it still runs to this day. Better times.
so is there no graphics card option for this laptop?
INVEST!!!!!!!!
yes
Gaming?
Its crazy how powerful small chips are becoming only half a decade a ago a standard laptop CPU and inboard graphics would struggle to play mine sweeper 😂
when are you water-cooling it
I love this, honestly tempted to support it, but would like to see a LITTLE MORE practice before buying.   Also, was that right? 3*2 screen? WTF, thats... different.
The right two repair yes yes yes
Wireless mouses can sometimes have a little lag, wired ftw!
no mother board no deal. too bad it's so hard. mainframes wouldn't hold up more then a year at this point either. be changing wiring and then it's almost defeating the whole purpose.
If I ever need a new laptop I am fully supporting this brand
maby they should have different lines of product for different people like a tough computer with radio modules and the like for field work. another could be designed for the broke collage student another the mobile gamer.
wish it would run Mac OS and windows
I almost passed this video by because I don't need another super crazy laptop that's all super top end. But this isn't, I can get a basic spec one (without an OS) for less than a grand (USD) and if I need to make the upgrades later. I'm pretty impressed.
Side note Linus mentioned partnerships or collaborations. I'm thinking the Dbrand maybe? Anyone else thinking teardown skins or optional clear housing so we can see the beautiful insides on the outside??
Omg I finally found my next laptop, the last time I got a laptop was my 2011 macbook pro. I can have USB type A Display Port Usb type-C. And I don't have to pry the battery out in 5 years when I want to replace the part so I continue to use it. I also love the design. DONE!!!! Just ordered mine 😁☺️😆. Thank you LMG team and Framework!!!! Framework u just received one more loyal customer. I've only had two laptops my entire life still using my 2nd one Frame work urs has just been chosen to bey next decade long laptop. I look forward to getting new changeable parts in the future. Also side note those ideas with custom anime keyboards or skins sounds boss!!
Dear Linus, my old laptop by HP has an upgradeable AMD APU that i have upgraded once already. Perhaps we should push for more manufacturers to use this Laptop Socket?
Will it run windows 11
I want it I want it I want it. Laptops should have been like that years ago
Linus: "OOOOMG A screw driver"   Genius laptop: "I'm in my feels now. You only wanted me for that ancient device"
Upgradeable laptop - So, from 1030 to 2080? Noooooope. Garbage.
I love what this company is doing so soo much. This should be the future.
Could we get a case comparison for cat owners? I have been looking at CORSAIR 680x and realized that the cat would be jumping up onto the tempered glass top. I then thought that pethair is a real concern and a pet friendly case review would be cool.
Show dell plz.
All the dislikes are from companies that told their employees to dislike this.
So the motherboard, CPU & GPU / APU can be changed / upgraded seperately ? I think for me a discrete GPU option to swap out would be most beneficial and future proof your investment.
11:45 DELL
I rather liked the old boxy laptops, they looked so ... manly ;-) ... yes, lobbying for the return of the laptops that looked like a pavement slab  nowadays I'd rather buy an asus pn51 than a laptop, my laptop is sitting closed anyway while connected to two monitors
"It all uses one bit?"  See? It's not that difficult, manufacturers.
Looks promising, but I said the same thing about Lenovo's Ultrabay system -- just before they dropped it. :/
meanwhile the only easy to remove and change part of my 6 year old acer aspire is the battery the fucking ram you have to unscrew all the back plane then pull on it with a fair bit of force to separate the keyboard since the only way to access anything on the inside is under the keyboard to then be able to switch the ram the hard drive isnt even fucking removable a standard spinning drive which is likely gonna break if dropped it means the full laptop basically has to be thrown out well done to framework's for creating an actual good laptop when they add support for uk keyboard layouts i will defiantly be upgrading to one
I just hoped they would let you choose to have windows or not, I won't buy a pc with windows to not even boot it once and put a linux on. But they don't sell in France yet so I guess its ok
I was thinking of saving up for a laptop anyway. Now I just need the $$$ and I'm sold, lol.
Although you can't "upgrade" MacBooks, you can probably spend less money by buying a new one every year and selling the previous generation.
I want this badly, not because I need a laptop that badly, but because I want to support the concept of this into the future.
Next stop definitely has to be a convertible-approach.
I can't afford this at all right now, but if I ever want a laptop i know where I'm going.
I am actually so freaking excited for this. Next time I buy a laptop IT WILL be this one.
Hey linus, when you need to upgrade cpu u usually  need new motherboard even in desktops. Yeah AMD has some leeway but intel new generation new motherboard usually. So if u can just buy the motherboard with cpu than new laptop its worth it since ram,case and storage is re usable.
so that means they could basically start to sell motherboards with soldered on CPUs for CPU upgrades later on?
Sadly no Ryzen plattform.
I'm definitely on board to get this laptop for a few reasons. But right now I have a 9 year old HP Envy DV7 that I'm trying to figure out how to prolong the life of. It's stuck on Windows 8.1 and needs to be upgraded and cleaned to pick up speed and to use programs I need. But I really don't want to get rid of it. So more computers built like this! Definitely on board.
I really love the idea and am in the market for a laptop(BTW, back to school coming?), but they would need a touch screen and qwertz keyboard.
Does it run Linux, tho? Can you try?  :D
I love their Linux support as well. First of all they don't force you to buy a Windows license if you'll never use it, and they specifically work on driver support for the hardware (like the fingerprint sensor that was mentioned, which don't always work on Linux) as well as Linux-specific documentation.
"casually".
Did you say a (maybe) RISC-V laptop?? I'd be all over that!
Cry me a river linus 😂😂😂
Well. Looks like I’m selling my 2019 M17 to save for one of these 😍
INVEST
That's my next laptop, as soon as I need a replacement. Not just because it looks good, but because I'm *always* going to prefer something I can repair. I'm the computer guy in my family, I've opened TENS of notebooks in my life and it's NEVER been easy. I'll also be recommending this notebook to all my friends and family, come to think of it.
boy..... I love modular, customizable stuff!
This thing looks absolutely AMAZING. I'm floored but how customizable, how configurable, how user friendly this thing looks. I've been looking for a new laptop and I think I found it. Thank you Linus. Got my order in. I did grab my M2 SSD though from Amazon, it was a bit cheaper than what they were offering for the same thing.
Magnetic charging  they already make magnetic chargers for type c. this would solve that issue.
This is an awesome idea. I hope they can give it more ports. I want 6 ports please, no more dongles  If this company succeeds, myself and millions of others, are happy to exclusively give them our money for the rest of our lives
Has modular ever worked for anything that's meant to be durable and/or practical?
I think I saw Linus almost shed a tear of joy.
Giving consumers options isn’t the best idea, only for power users.
I will definitely buy it when AZERTY Keyboard and EU electrical sockets is out
is it correct that i'm missing ethernet modules?
I am curious. Has anyone done a perfomance benckmark with this laptop ?
Ehm .. upgradable wireless in notebooks ? I've had at least 3 enterprise grade notebooks (Dell & HP) where I needed to flash a hacked bios/EFI to bypass the manufacturers stupid whitelisting which doesn't allow you to use the slots for whatever you want ...... Is this not a thing anymore ?
@framework. Lenovo has a mode where the battery is kept at 50% SOC if you will be plugged in for a while. You could have either a bios setting or a driver beeing active in the task bar tray that switches that on. I dont know if they have a patent on it but i find it annoying to go 10 clicks deep into a driver menu to turn that feature on.
I wish Framework succeed in making a foothold in the market.
Yay a laptop that's double in price for the spec! Wahoo!
Im about to have a nerdy bloody nose attack from how excited i am. As soon as i save up the money im gonna buy me this
This is great!
im buying it when it has cpu gpu options and also screen hinge and touch screen option
I think Linus and other YT creators who support right to repair should all back this product. Whatever that means for them. Wether that be investment or free ads. This is the future that we deserve as consumers.
love the idea. i will consider getting one, once they offer localised keyboards and chargers! until then I will have to deal with my poorly engineered, build to fail, lenovo yoga 530, that had the display panel mount break (not the hindge or frame) after less then a year because I used it as 2in1 as advertised, and the didn't fix it on warranty.
laptop brands: YOU CANT JUST MAKE A LAPTOP UPGRADABLE AND MODULAR!!!! IT WILL BE UPGLY AND THICC!!! Framework: *HAHA UPGRADES GO BRRR!!!*
I was holding out for an AMD system 76 laptop after Anthony's video on it but now this is definitely the new plan
Thoughtful design, right attitude about whose preference matters. A winner in my book.
Apple rn : wait that's illegal 😂
'A completely upgradable laptop'  that's just a monitor with extra steps!
This is great for a QA team for their labs.
They build a laptop the way that Honda builds a car.
Me looking at my 45 pound Suitcase "Laptop"
WOW Please let this succeed so everything is like this in the future  WOWWOOWOWOWO/OWOWW XDX DXD LOL copy cat
People are too quick to throw away old laptops. If you have splunging tools that cost a couple dollars you can easily fix or upgrade laptops. I have an old a Samsung R55 from 10 years ago. I just purchased new speakers and new CPU/GPU fan/heatsink for it. I also purchased a new AX200 wireless card. Now I have a perfectly useable notebook still with wifi that connect to the latest network types. Looking at linus's video here it does look interesting though when he said the CPU was soldered it seemed a bit lame. The hardest parts i have seen that are to replace are the CPU heatsinks, speakers and motherboard / power.
Stop monkeying around.  We are interested to know about notebook upgradability, not your actor.  You did not tell me which laptop for upgradability.  You spent more time on your silly acting.  😖
So when are they going to release a 15" version with an included num-pad on the keyboard?
I just put together a system but I want to buy this just to support this idea.
HAHAHAHA Beautiful MAC book. That must be some good stuff that your smoking. So, what you are saying is that when you damage you USB port, or your charging port... Instead of having to take apart your laptop to e-solder it back, or replace, or have some one else replace (For a lot of money), you can pop out the module, and replace the component you broke (on accident of course). Ingenious!
This laptop is like a dream come true.
17:11 ***ACTIVATE WINDOWS***
lord this is more convincing than any of their ad reads lmao
I have no real need for a laptop, but i WANT one
i really want one
It's sad when treating your customers with respect, giving them what they want, and not lying to them is shocking and not the norm.
My only concern with this company's philosophy is the fact that you are obligated to pay for windows
Unattended Driver Install!!! That get an A++++ in my book!!!! Worth it right there....
Not going to fly. And this is not a first try on a long line of a failed tries to go modular. They spent a lot on advertising rather than R&D so uneducated hipsters be amazed by four USB port extensions. :)
1:50 - 2:01 there is so point. German "Shift Phones" are fully modular smartphones! 😉 But nice to see that there are laptops with the same features out there. 😍
if they can put out new motherboards with new intel/amd waves of CPU's that can keep using the same 'case' and periferals, that is how you would upgrade your cpu.  i just hope they include a modular gpu part. like those used in blade servers that some workstation laptops also use, but with more types.
@6:01 you didn't think we'd notice... But we did.. but HEY! Its okay ~Wink~
wait, what about a bigger screen and GPU?
I guess  I found my next laptop replacement in the future
What I would love to see is that they accept returned parts for recycling and/or second hand market after they've been repaired by them, I like tech a lot ...obviously, but E-waste isn't something we should ignore or take lightly. I'll 100% consider this product for my next portable workstation!
it was about time ! one strep in the right direction for sure . tho even my old lenovo which is more than 6 years old had the cpu socked...................till the i ll pass ....cpu must be upgradable foe me to be considered a 100% leap forward
this is good. I firmly believe in right to repair and upgrade. I haven't been able to bring myself to stick with crapple since they solder everything to the board now. I don't want my laptop to be built like a smartphone. Crapple may have stolen some of my ideas over the years but they always make them so much worse than I would have if I had their trillion dollar economic weight. monopolies are killing innovation and contributing to the environmental collapse with their throw away design ethos
8:17 Yes! He pulled a Linus. Thanks Linus
1:38 so close to pulling a Linus and dropping something expensive
I wasnt here for about 10 years and... BRO, WTF IS THIS BEARD?! Shave this ginger shit!
The current is price $999.00 with $100.00 deposit charge for base DIY version. The deal got expensive within a week. Damn.
These are pretty awesome!
Linus Dialing Up
liked the laptop..... interested. no, still find linus s reviews annoying.
I wish I wasn't working a minimum wage job right now and could afford one of these easily. I can't really justify the purchase yet, but I would love to be a part of this movement as it continues to grow.
finally they made it
is this laptop good for gaming????
Other companies say "Screw you!", these guys say "Screw? You!"
I think the detach battery bios option is for when you are going to disassemble the laptop and not really for running it of the wall. Also this and the Power on AC attach options are fairly common
that is a good ideea but is so expensive
great video showcase!
Considering that i'm leaving the marine corps for a new job in the states, i could use one of these. Gonna pick me one up
Linus sounds like those old “sponsor-a-child” commercials when he said “It costs them a fraction of a cent  But it means *sooo much* to the end users”
Was that a note 7
Its better than my pc lol
Bleh. Just a productivity laptop.
11:35 Dell
gimme
Everyone who owns A MacBook watching be like, its not an Apple?
I still refuse to change from a wired mouse.!
That logo could use some upgrades tho
whatever you did you did it right because ytb was pushing this vid to me so hard lol
I would like to see some kind of graphics card upgradability, but thats my ONLY knock on this product. I will probably be looking into one of these in the future.
fcking take my moneyyyy: 💲💲💵💸💰💵
The point of right to repair is so your iphone doesn't end up in the landfill because a half cent resistor failed or the glued in battery died. Or how about a 50% chance of smashing your windshield to change or charge the battery in your car. Would you put up with that? Well this is where we are with phones. All the companies following Apple and Apple claim to be the greenest but are the biggest polluter because they resist repair of their devices at every opportunity. This is why they should be forced to support their devices and properly repair and supply parts.
I applaud Framework for trying to bring something back that once was a given or at least much more widespread. You see, we actually used to have an almost comparable amount of upgradability and repairability up to 7-8 years ago, at least with certain notebook product lines. Older models of the IBM / Lenovo T-series are a good case in point. Basically everything about these devices was upgradeable and repairable, which helped to increase the lifespan of the product significantly. To give an example, I personally still use a T430 from 2013 to this very day. Over the years, I have upgraded the CPU, RAM, main memory and display, and I have exchanged the original smaller battery for a larger one. I had to replace the entire keyboard once, and two individual keys due to wear of the mechanism under the pads. None of this was a big deal because original spare parts were widely available (Lenovo discontinued hardware support only last year or so). Owing to all of this, the device is still a decent workhorse for most computer applications. Sadly, Lenovo started soldering shit onto their mainboards like everybody else in following generations of T-series notebooks ...
This could be our future, I would be keen to see what Gen 2 looks like if enough early adopters come through.
just wowwwww
This is wild. I've never ONCE, in all my years watching Linus, wanted to buy anything he's showcased. Until now. I'm going to get one as soon as they can ship to Australia.
fingers crossed they have a 2-in-1 variant (or at least touch) when I'm in the market for a new laptop
Cry Me a River button 07:53 you are welcome everyone.
Linus is getting so much flak from apple now
I am in love 😍🥰 For me it was the Mic hardware switch.
I think I've found my next laptop, thanks LTT Team!
B站来的。太爱这个机器了，希望能大卖，逼得其他厂商跟进。
Many compliments to Framework! How friction cool! And well overdue
I'm was hoping for *CPU & GPU upgrade*  I'll pass, not for me.
These guys deserve a Nobel prize for services to humanity, I wish them every success. I want one where I can switch the keyboard and  ( useless) trackpad with a second screen. Both screens should be pen and touch. Love the Logo, that cog could be worn as a badge of honour. Kudos Framework.
Is it possible to buy only the spare parts and assemble the whole machine out of spare parts only?
This is a company I gotta follow , this is dope AF.
you know the tech is good when linus is screaming about it
Excellent
Linus accidently started a job war
Richtig richtig geil, endlich mal ne Firma, die es verstanden hat, mal sehn bis die, von den Großen, aufgekauft und in der  Versenkung verschwinden wird, wäre sehr schade. Go on Framework!
stop watching linus since years ago, because hes annoying, very annoying, i just cant stand his voice and how he represent him self, have to open this video just to know what that laptop is and straight to another video explaining the product
Im torn as the most ce technologically inclined person in my family I’ve opened plenty of PCs and done repairs but I’m also a designer c © abs appreciate sleek design and I have a love for apple products  and the intense specialization’s done to push design forward   It’s not sustainable but I see it both ways I may invest in one in the near future for a family member or     ... a second laptop right now Im invested in seeing what 10 years of mobile design from the iPad and iPhone looks like categories over to the Mac side looks like the  iMac itself was impressive shrinking that huge board down to the size of a graham cracker and making the computer case as thin as a modern day tv or tablet kinda genius
Thank god the future finally decided to show up.  It was drinking before the party and forgot to show up for 20 years.
why is he making the video in a kitchen lol
why does linus still use note 9
"So I do t have to click next, next, next ,next like some kind of monkey" Linux users: I do t have such weaknesses.
COMPLETELY Upgradeable - it's when you can change cpu and gpu and motherboard.
Ahh! If only they made this last year. This is beatifull
This product needs to be successful for all our future 🤩🤩
This guy is over-hying this product, its not 'fully upgradeable' i agree its steps in the right direction, and the quality/pricepoint is decent, just settle down there a little bit, eh
This is great! Wld love to have one of these!
More content from this please.
Imagine frame.work and system 76 combine forces
About your repair comment, Linus, I really hope you aren't being a shill for Apple. It's only hard to repair their products because they don't want people to repair them!!!!! It's not because they are "small" it's because Apple puts in 20 different types of screws just to get into the guts and they try making 3rd party products illegal so you can only go to them and pay 10 times the cost.
exactly.  it was always possible to do better.  They just wanted an excuse to force you to buy another laptop after your battery died. Or when you get a single speck of dust in your keyboard.  apparently
1:38 Goddammit Linus, you just gave me a heart attack
Idk. I just sent them an e-mail asking four simple questions and they can't even reply to it competently, only telling me that I should keep a lookout for when they'd start shipping to my region, the other three questions about whether there would be a lower end CPU version, whether they'd have an alternative PCB with AMD CPUs, and whether they would consider adding a MXM slot so the GPU can also be upgraded, went unanswered. That raises some red flags in my book.
who will buy this kind of laptop, or how many % ppl will buy this kind of laptop? look back IBM ThinkPad, not only offer you overwhelming parts like dock, graphic dock, portable floppy/DVD/CD/hard disk, 2nd hard disk tray even a portable 10key calculate, but also upgradable CPU, RAM and hard disk slots ... what is the outcome, died! ThinkPad died, and now all become Ultrabook, thin and light and everything soldered into motherboard.
When I start for college, I'm most definitely going to look in to getting one
" THE DELL ISN'T EVEN F*****G THINNER."  linus 2021
i want to sell my laptop just for this omg
making magnetic charging connector clone station for this laptop, – gotcha!
Having tech being complimented by linus is the tech equivalent to Gordon Ramsey complimenting your food.
honestly the fact that i can replace the charging port is enough for me to buy once my dell poops out. I can only hope they're still around and thriving by then
"Cry me a river, Linus..." "LOOK HERE SIR!!!!" lol Bout timethey began making upgradable laptops ffs.
Hmmmm. I need to figure out if I can build a Framework Laptop that will be an upgrade and replacement for my current gaming laptop.
Whhhhaaat? You mean tech companies lie to us about repairability and upgradablity in their products and/or purposefully making them that way?! >Pikachu shocked face<  Cool I see a laptop like this, wanna get one now.
I would love one except 13 inch is way too small.  Let me know when they make a 17 inch one
When he showed the screen bezel being easy to take off, first thing i thought of was the older i-macs and the phones back in the 90s and 00s with customizable face-plates.  I was not disappointed when i went to their website and they showcased the bezel switching between black, white and orange
This is huge. I might buy one.
God I wish I had this computer it’s my dream machineeee
One question do they support thunderbolt for an external GPU.
I need one like right now
how novel. i'll consider owning a laptop case for 20 years once they start allowing swappable motherboards, cpus, and gpu.
LOL. I wanted to order a (substantial) model. Alas ..... guess which is the only country they're shipping to? That's just dumb, logistics aren't that hard. YouTubers do it for Patreon rewards. Guess I will get a Lenovo and ignore this for another couple years because of ... questionable fulfillment decisions.
If it had a dedicated GPU I would absolutely consider buying it!
Even after making sure to pick the same exact configuration (including Win10), the DIY model seems to end up being $130-$175 CAD more expensive than the prebuilt. How do we get $300 worth of savings mentioned at 2:39 ?
I'd better pay 500$ after 2-3 years than shell out 1500 for a new device.
This product is truly amazing. My one gripe, would be the screen aspect ratio. And even that isn't that big of deal.
Finally some good f*cking food.
You can see how happy Linus is in this video, especially compared to that HP sponsor.
9:29 I've done this
Thunderbolt adapter?
I'm in the market for a new laptop right now. What could possibly go wrong if I decide to be an early adopter and just buy this?
Make a custom PC or NAS or something cool using just the motherboard. Aka high powered arduino. Would give them a business case to sell just Mobo's for projects instead of having to build entire PC's.
DROP TEST DROP TEST DROP TEST
This is amazing! Hope they will open show in Europa :-)
Review running Linux on it, please.
We must protect this company at all costs...
I need it in black, AMD Ryzen, mate 3:2 screen, passive cooling, and spill-proof keyboard. thnx
Have refused to get a laptop for years because of the inability to upgrade or repair most of the components easily. Really excited to see how this pans out.
I am happy seeing my next laptop.
Buying one when I can.
The shrill join daily imagine because mustard lately steer to a well-off bay. used, relieved michael
If Framework puts out a similar gaming laptop Im sold.
Magnetic charging? *cough cough* Voltar?
These guys' names belong in the history book. This is the type of thing that I would just put down and admire routinely.
OMG... This is the future of laptops!, It should be!
iFixit reparability score: 10/10!!! SUCK IT APPLE!!!
ignoring all the practicality, it's just a cool thing to have. Also, this company has a really good revenue model.
"THE DELLS NOT EVEN FUCKING THINNER"  ROFL Im genuinely interested in buying one of these laptops now. Also the fact those modules use type C means you could pull apart the enclosure or 3D print the enclosure and put literally anything you want into one as long as you can make it fit.
Now after I purchased a alien 51 r2 ( $3000) because it is upgradable and a replacement desktop, they come out with this Framework laptop. It's better, lighter, cheaper, and more upgradable. Can I get it in a 17 inch screen?
An ARM version would be interesting, also a larger version with a bigger modular bay to add an optical drive would be good.
I would like a pocket size mini case with this system. No keyboard, screen, pad etc. Ethernet dongle, full size sd card etc are missing but they will probably come. I really like this idea and product.
Unfortunatelly, no performance testing. Only tempeature and fan noise is mentioned.
Just watched a old advert for pulseway with Linus starring in it. And Linus, that was not your wife.
Amazing!
You should contrast this with a macbook.
Please go buy one if these if you love it🙏 this company and product has to survive! Game changer!
Totally awesome!!! 'Bout time someone shook the Apple proprietary tree..LOL
The cheerful enquiry univariately explode because bowling coincidingly object through a frantic cat. untidy, bizarre growth
When this gets to 17 inches and numerical keyboard format, I will get this for sure. This is the way forward. Imagine the engineering edition with com ports for programmers, IO oscilloscope cards for EE.
This looks like the perfect laptop for a kid/teen in school! My school gave some of us with learning problems a laptop, they used to be these actually armored Think-Pad looking things that couldn't break, (ive seen one fall down 2 flights of cement stairs and was fine) but then they replaced them with Dell XPSs, man they were freaking nice laptops, but every week someone else I knew with one would have it in for repairs... Broken screens were apparently the most common. I talked with my computers teacher about it and he said the school isn't ever buying more of them, they used their entire yearly budget for computer repairs in 3 months on just a few hundred laptops, yet next year they bought an entire computer lab of I-Macs, that went even worst lol
❤️ this idea, let's hope some other manufacturers pay attention!
Meh …
nice marketing.
Why would you want user to be able to repair the device if you can repair it for them for hefty  price? :D That's the reason why big companies didn't bother. Though I'm still going to continue repairing my Iphone 5s as long as it won't disintegrate.
Planned obsolescence is major profit source for big tech companies like Apple so I feel like this company will have a lot of targets on its back.  Hopefully they survive though!
If I was in the market for a new laptop, I would have bought this in a heartbeat!
well the main things we need to change usually are the CPU and gpu but it's a great step forward
Watching this is like watching Linus on Christmas, and I don't blame him because I would react the same
holy shit this is incredible, doing the DIY build I could save about $300 by just grabbing the NVME drive and RAM from my current laptop and plugging them in. Essentially all I'd have to buy is the chassis, CPU and wifi card!
All this features might be cool, but when the laptop have no power, to work proper with it - its useless.....as always. new, useless products..more and more....disgusting...
I've never seen a better example of "shut up and take my money!"
If I'm buying a laptop in future it will be from framework
which brand laptop is this ?
Well there are those usb c magnet cables where you can switch heads to micro usb or iphone connector. Maybe that could be the solution for now until some dude does the type c magnetic port
when they hopefully have a AMD option for the CPU I definitely get
Bookmarked for my next laptop!
93% of the market: yeah, we just need a well-balanced set of components that we use every day for about 3 years.
the qr code thing is annoying and unnecessary, paper manuals would be much easier and more useful
wait why did you pay the sponsership instead of the other way around?
I wish it had an wired Ethernet addon
"if it were upgradeable it would be looking like some 2010 piece of crap" *looks at 2010 macbook pro* i mean, he isn't wrong or right. it is repairable and not overly thicc
The cost of this upgradability is thickness - this device is at least two times thicker than MacBook Pro and even more when comparing to Air.
This is pretty great. Got a connector close by for charging, but the port isn't right? Swap it out for one that is. Customization is what the future is about - the ability to do what you want, no extra charges / fees needed.
i am buying this
So what screen manufacturer do we have to agro to get a touchscreen made to fit this laptop? Imagine being able to home upgrade the screen to touch. Damn, third-party vendor heaven.
I hope they put Apple (AND ALL THE OTHERS) out of business as a hardware manufacturer.
I have a laptop from 2013 HP elite that is so customizable you can even change CPU & GPU and the new 2021 Z series only gives you a ton of SSD upgrades. and of course, it's 3kg and super thick. But I love it and I'm so happy to see more brandings thinking like me.
the first name was indian in the team name list . tech support guys
"Modular" means that you can replace any "module" of the laptop that uses standard usb-c to interconnect (even when some peripherals performs better over pci-x) buying slightly overpriced modules from the only seller available? You can found the same adaptor on amazon or aliexpress but without this fancy form factor. And what about processor or memory? You can upgrade from ddr4 to ddr5? No? Then this "upgradeable" is useless. How many rams you broke in the last 30y?
The gray greasy great mask inexplicably confess because cart retrospectively amuse vice a probable woolen. damp, responsible mom
please please please support them, finally someone is caring about the end users
@framework add a "charge to storage charge" or "80% option" please!
Dang it. I Want this
This is the future
Love the openness of the company. Hate the thinness of the laptop.
The price is stupid high for what it has in it not worth it
I wish they had AMD processor/GPU options, with a possibility to upgrade to a later processor once released. It's the equivalent to a desktop, and it's more or less... Futureproof.  This desktop is *12 years old* and it has 24GB DDR3 Single Channel RAM, among other goodies, AMD to the heart and core. Only time i'm going to purchase a new machine, is once they have *triple data rate* RAM.
11:34 spit it out "D"
Sweet!
This definitely would be the dream laptop for geeks who like get hands on their own gear to make some modification.  I also want to invest in this thing and get one as soon as possible.
Come on apple are mentally challenged, aside their intentionally bad design. It takes a special kind of genius to make a laptop with heat sink disconnected from the cooling fan, not to mention a huge number of issues at software level that makes it harder to do basic stuff from open the device or even receive emails.
Very good concept. How do i get one for myself.
Linus is gust getting people to do the elegal stuff for him
Unfortunately this thing wasn't build for People outside of the US or Canada - no choice regarding a different Keyboard Layout and no choice regarding Power Adapters. And without a choice regarding the CPU this is still a no Go. To have the choice between Intel, Intel and Intel is just not enough.
If I ever need a laptop I know where to get one
we need a laptop manufacture to bring back CPU's on expansion card like the late 90's. CPU on something like MMX and we will have a fully up gradable laptop. And how long until the makers get hold of these and you start seeing GPIO inserts on github?
4:52 apple ? (🍏) 🤣🤣🤣🤣 they  are actually making their products more difficult to repair every model, because they want you to pay a ridiculous ammount to fix it, a youtuber broke the screen of her macbook air, they charged her $700, wow with that money i would buy a new decent laptop.
It's possible but companies never dare to make a perfect device that doesn't need to be replace for a new one 2 years later...It would ruin their sell marketing strategy.
*impossible*
This is so awesome, I fricking love it!
I LOVE IT !! ❤
It's a toughbook, but more upgrade-able and less extreme
Honestly if the support from upgradeable boards (cpu) a bigger form factor for those who want the room to have extra power... this is or " should" be the future of laptops
Because they just want to make more money!  The more irreparable design makes the user need to completely replace it after a certain degree of damage. The non-upgradable design forces users to replace the entire set of equipment rather than just a part of it.
I want a shamwoo type review from Linus
The energetic tower nomenclaturally match because kettledrum genotypically fill aside a gabby white. irritating, general gentle lunchroom
I almost regret buying my X1 nano haha
Public companies have a desire for unsustainable growth. This goes from a new, vibrant company changing the world to an anti-consumer, penny pinching corporation. Companies like Apple with a 2 trillion value have no choice but to push super-underhanded tactics to save as much money as they can. Buy from smaller businesses, stay away from corporations and the customers will win.  Unfortunately the majority love convenience so corporations always seem to win out. "You will own nothing and be happy".
Pixart is a great company. They have practically taken over the optical mouse sensor market. I'm sold. Will be getting one as soon as possible. Wish they had AMD models though. An 8 core Zen3 in that would be great. This will actually be the very first Intel processor that I have ever owned. I been all AMD since 1992. I hate it but we need to support this company.
Dell XPS the gold standard as far as flex goes? Uhhhhhhh MacBook Pro.......
My Chromebook Pixel LS 2015 has color coded screws. If they make a USB4 one of these, it'll replace my chromebook. Also, Apple's magnetic charger patent only covers chargers that can go in upside down, it's been sidestepped by ones that work connect at any degree of rotation.
The problem with the framework: It's Intel Only.
I'm so excited for this company hope they have shipping for Egypt
@12:45 WHERE ARE THESE DRIVERS AVAILABLE. I would love to get my hands on something similar for my Dell XPS 7590. This is the first I've heard of any Goodix fingerprint reading having Linux drivers.
i love watching you mess around with tech i can never think of affording keep it up btw not opposed to hand me downs lol
I honestly would get this just to support them. This is so cool
just imagine: getting that laptop, and running Linux on it. That would be the perfect laptop for me - even if the gaming performance is only adequate, that's not the point of a laptop anyway.
The big question is will parts be available? A product is only as good as the parts distribution.
I hope Framework will succeed on this and keep going well ahead of other companies that don't offer this kind of convenience.. They don't have any competitors at the moment, do they?
this is amazing
linus drop tips
who else got a honey add that had him in it
sounds like its customizable for now.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life� He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful� the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
They might sell motherboard with latest cpu 2-3 years from now which are compatible with your current device so that you don't have to buy a new laptop.
It is a common myth that leaving batteries on constant charge will deteriorate them. It won't.
A good step away from know-it-all own fart sniffing connoisseurs who want dumb down everything and funnel their zombie users to a checkout. I'm not saying it's Apple, but it's Apple.
It makes me cringe how Linus grabs and handles the notebook with the display open
Panasonic toughbooks are similar but tough https://toughruggedlaptops.com/refurbished-toughbook-tough-rugged-laptops.html
If these guys come out with an AMD version--especially an AMD 6000 APU with RDNA2 onboard--that will replace my XPS15 and the Dell will get sent to some lucky friend.
Speaking of Dell and glued-in laptop batteries, it looks like my 9550 (whose battery now gets 15-20 minutes of life 5 years in) has a completely swappable battery with a Phillips head and a Torx, no glue at all, and as far as I can tell, none of the modern XPS laptops have glue either. Just Apple and Microsoft and such. So give Dell just a teeny bit of credit.
#trendnow!
time to buy the definitive laptop
>>Completely upgradable laptop! >> With soldered CPU.
Can it run Linux?
If these come to the UK, I am so going to be getting one - they are exactly what all laptops should be nowadays: upgradable, repairable, and modular. If they made a 15 inch version with 6x modular ports, or a 17 inch version with 8x modular ports, then even better :D
The one thing it's missing is a slot for a CD drive.
Wait wait wait wait..... What do you mean "No longer?" in that first statement? Rossman does repairs on these things since like 2008 and he actively teaches people with no education on electronics how to do it.
Spoilers, they're all at the $1k-$2k range
I don't even want a laptop and I'm sold on it.  I will definitely spread the word on Framework.
FAke NeWS!! No engineer worth his degree could possibly create something that is this repair/modification friendly!! I will never buy technology that doesn't require pieces of plastic snapping off and potential glass fractures as mandatory to disassembly!    (jk... I'm buying 2 as soon as blood flow returns to my brain)
So, no Ethernet Jack?  Yet... they don't sell an expansion card for ethernet at the moment, but might in the future... Weirdly, it's almost a deal-breaker for me although usb to ethernet dongles are a thing. Otherwise, I just love the whole idea and execution. Add an ARM board that rivals Apples M1 and I'll take three and won't even whine about no ethernet.
If it was in Europe i had already bought it
They prob should have launched with a "gamer" version tho. High refresh rate a 2070 and I'm in.
This is the freaking future my folks. Enough of disposable electronic devices.
Google's Project ARA: Time to run away!
64 GB Ram in a laptop, bro thats awesome... also modular laptops good too.
My next laptop will be a Framework when I'll need a new one, provided that they are available in my country + has a keyboard layout from my country preferably the latest iteration
Meh no gaming session demo in this video
What sold me is that the motherboard can be reused when replaced with a newer one.  When I upgrade, I can use my old mobo as a little power efficient server
Can someone help me? If i order this nice machine, but want to do heavy video editing, is there a solid way to run a external graphicscard?
Two points: No dedicated graphics (negative), and people will psych up for upgrades like we did before laptops were a thing. (positive).
I will now never buy another laptop ever again. Though AMD CPU and German keyboard layout would be awesome, but I guess it's too early for something like this.  I still hold the opinion you should invest in them btw. but I guess that's probably not on the table anymore.
My heart smiled when Linus almost droped this one too LMFAO
now if this could hackentosh..... ffffffff!! orget you apple or what? i hate apple. ex apple owner, fed up of their overheating trash burning out gpu's etc (and crashing os all the time!!!!!!!! - yep you read that right, had so little hassle with Windows XP,7 & 10 vs OS9 through OSX 10.4 or 5 - i like to tweak my os and was forever having to use recovery disc or some other for of jump starting osx (os9 was better). People who use pc's, actually USE them, don't use apple. "b.b.b.but Apple's are a media computer" LOL yeah, no, that might have been relevant 20 years ago when they were the only computer that audio i/o, but anyone who knows what they are taling about knows apple are flogging that dead horse to this day despite it being nonsense. Irony - apple owners think they're smarter for using apple products - pay near twice as much for the exact same internals. real smart.  ps did I say i hate apple?  pps I still own a Pismo laptop (which unlike recent apple products, still works, slow af but works) and it was when apple were "ok" - essentially the first modular laptop - this laptop being the 2nd.... =D
wouldda been nicer if the usb-c module was actually a hub (two ports, or more if they'd fit) rather than just a passthrough.
And the case is unavailable......
this is amazing
I FELL IN LOVE THIS LAPTOP
im unhappy with life, goodbye :D
This is the 1st time I have seen a high end laptop review that I am actually interested in. Hope the company does great! I'd love to order from them in the near future if they are all they claim to be.
Reminds me of project Ara. The Google modular shit.
I hope they get to expand to Europe. This sounds awesome, although maybe not the cheapest option for the light coffee table laptop my wife and I are looking for.
For how much longer are you guys gonna wear those masks? life goes on friends
the moment they have it in AMD flavor, i'm in.
F U APPLE AND YOU OTHER MANUFACTURERS! THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!
This product is amazing!…but also 5 years too late
I almost bought one just for this. Not including taxes and shipping i found you can get an ok setup for less then a thousand dollars. This is really surprising. The only thing that is holding me back is having to use integrated intel graphics. Yes i'm sure i can get an external enclosure for a fullsize graphics card but i'm not 100% on that. I'm not the kind of user who needs a laptop that can have a core I5 or I7 with upto 64g of memory and a potential 5 tb of storage (if you get three 1tb expansion cards) without also needing a more powerful pixel pusher. I'll keep my eye out for future versions of this and i'll definitely recommend this to any friends or family looking for a new laptop but at present it's not quite what i'm looking for
The world really needs this really badly Being in IT, i see too much money going into repairing and replacing laptops in companies, even for the smallest issue. Making a laptop this modular and easy to repair, this can save quite a lot of resources.
Everyone gangsta until they add a egpu dongle
Had a family friend in the early 90’s that didn’t have cases on his workbench. Dirty shop. Motherboards screwed onto peg board and cables running everywhere.
I think framework is a group of people that came from the future, Yup. definitely!
God, it’s like the guy who was telling me about this new tech called a Universal Serial Bus. It’s was the way of the future and everything would be upgradable.
I think people can use a 7 year old laptop for most purposes.  Unless they provide a possibility to replace cpu and GPU, it doesn't make much sense to invest in this.
Linus is the Tech king been following since the early days (aka NCIX customer support)
where can i buy one, link?
Wow now I am seriously consider to buy one
I REALLY HOPE THIS SELLS WELL. MAD RESPECT FOR FRAMEWORK !!!
Im wondering tough if they ever make a modular gaming pc. As i dont see any way to upgrade the graphics cards, or even buy directly(atm its not worth it anyways) from them a graphics card from the get go. The modular system is great and isnt expensive, would buy if it was also focused on gaming aswell as it might make me change into buying a gaming laptop.
The laptop I dreamt of .. no more losing screws ( uh-uh :) I even bought one of those electric screwdrivers cause it saves so much time with all those screws ...Oh wait ..what about a GRAPHIC CARD !?
wow...just watching how this laptop is made makes me happy on the inside
Most laptops are upgradable anyways in terms of HDD/SSD, RAM, WIFI, Display, touchpad, keyboard, battery etc, except for CPU and GPU, which are precisely the modules you usually want to really upgrade.
Hey Apple! Are you seeing this? Wake up!!!  I have worked with Apple products since the intro of the original Mac in 1984. I have admired their work over the decades, but I have to say that the introduction of this approach to laptop design should hopefully be the kick in the ass that Apple (and others) need right now.  Apple has lost their way due to their focus on Anorexic Engineering (making design choices that seem to do just about everything possible to make devices as thin as possible while sacrificing almost every other design priority) and Planned Obsolescence (as a way to maximize revenue while cloaking this intention behind disingenuous claims of wanting to save the environment).   If someone has an effective way to would…  environmentjustifyrequirespeopleyour  I hope this design approach is a wakeup call to Apple and the other manufacturers that have gotten lazy over the past 10-15 years. Step up.
bump
PLEASE this company don't die! Make this worldwide and successful!
this is the first product that made me feel "it is necessary to buy this". love the framework philosophy. please open bookings in India.
I would love to see a Tablet-Laptop like Surface Pro from them. Would buy that instantly.
"This is affordable". I am sorry, Linus, but $999 with $100 deposit is NOT affordable by any sense of the word. I'll wait and see if the price comes down, before I think about investing in a Framework laptop to replace my aging Lenovo Ideapad.
Do they come with an AMD based model?
What GPU options are there
I hope to buy a Framework laptop and install Mac OS on it.
Defintiely gonna buy this if its available here
The main advantage I see isn't upgradability, it's manufacturing costs. If the company has just 1 or 2 chassis then it saves money. Upgradeability, somewhat, yeah for the ports and it's neat but you are limited by the motherboard for upgrading of things like CPU/RAM and new features. You can do the same port upgrade on a regular laptop by just getting a USB addon.
Let's hope this takes off. There has been attempts make laptops support modular peripherals in the past such as PCMCIA and ExpressCard but this is next level.
it makes me so unhappy that he’s swinging around that laptop
I like 2010 laptops.......
The way you keep slinging that thing around, I'm going to guess it's service life to be about 2 hours.
In the FAQs they say you can upgrade you CPU by exchange the motherboard (to a new one with new CPU). And i guess you can build that then in your (already existing old) laptop-case and take all you old cards (like W-Lan, speaker, RAM, SSD...) and put it on your new mainboard-CPU combination.   So at least it sounds like it would work like that.
As soon as I will need a Laptop, I will buy it from these guys. Thats a 100% promise!
Here a question in the bois when enable the battery disconnect does it still charge or it doesnt.
this is the laptop of my dreams. I wish I was earning to get one though....
This!..Apple/HP/acer etc etc etc..PAY ATTENTION!!.. THIS WILL BE THE FUTURE
Whats a ITX?...for external graphics cards?
*the extra screws hit my feelings*
Are we gonna address what occurred at 11:54?
Haha if you are pissed on dell xd
I'm going shopping for a Framework! :D
It's an over priced gimmick for people who don't mind spending a few extra hundred dollars to make a statement. Not really seeing anything here so special that it justifies the significantly higher MSRP Frameworks is asking. You can swap the ram and disk drives on laptops, unless this gives you the ability to swap graphics cards or something major like that all I'm seeing are some swappable ports that mount flush with the case (as long as you have a USB 3 in port you can do the same thing).
Do they have a facebook page ?? :)
The laptop camera quality seems better in my opinion. I can see more details and it feels more saturated as well.
11:28 ROTFL! :D
Ok the way he speaks we can see this is paid ad....  like this is best thing on the planet.
Love the idea, but where's the Ethernet port?
This is the best shit I saw in probabbly 10 years. I hope it's not gonna die soon.
I really hope this company goes towards supporting 3rd party components equally. The problem I see with a lot of modular and repairable component companies is they have planned obsolescence and only support their own approved.  Product looks amazing and I hope they live up to these standards
i am loving this going to look at it just now amazing !!
START TALKING ABOUT PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE!   oh wait you wont!    a lot of your channels funds would dry up pretty quick...
Well, I'm sold.
THE TOYOTA OF LAPTOPS HAS JUST ARRIVED
I already have a laptop I'm happy with but I want to support this company so really considering getting this just to do so.
On the Framework's homepage:  “The team over at Framework has managed to not just create a laptop that is easily repairable and upgradable, but it‘s also a thin, gorgeous, performant laptop.” Linus Tech Tips
*LETS SUPPORT THIS COMPANY BIG TIME*
Just like Google bought the modular phone and killed it, some PC manufacturer will buy this company and quietly kill this company.
Linus, my guy. put it down... I'm having a panic attack watching you swing it around.
I got an advertisement of Apple on this video 😂
good direction   sweet
I can't wait for the 2in1 version. Please make it happen (and still affordable), Framework. 🙏
gonna save up for this
Great for the hard core geek, but the average Jo consumer or pro is more interested in buying a computer to do stuff than parts of a computer to assemble.
RIP for Phoebus Cartel and Planned Obsolesence thingy, LOL
Wow 1080p. Is this the beginning of Laptop Upgrade?
put the bloody thing down linus ffs
RIP not in europe yet. I actually need one and am convinced
very interesting
Meanwhile apple:we are removing the included charger from our phone Box to save the environment.  Also Apple: You can buy our overprices dongles if you want to connect any external device. Yeah,you also have to get an entire new device if something goes wrong
I wouldn’t boot off of it means I’ll try it later
Nice and simple logo too
Wiish we could get these in India.
I hope they will add a gaming Device also, so with GPUs you can swap and so on. Imagine how cool this is, if you don't need to dump your entire laptop only because of the GPU.
Best laptop that I've ever see, better than ANY laptop
God damn! I just bought a laptop 3 days ago 😭🤣
Wow I love this.  Could you say, slot something like 3 of those compute modules in a Mini ITX style frame, to make it a powerful adobe design rid. Each compute blade able to run ID, Ai  office  with built in UPS from the battery.
2:17 ooooh it comes with a screwdriver
No ESD precautuons Linus?
"Completely upgradeable" is just a gimmick. When you want to upgrade the RAM, then you would realized that your processor not supporting the new version of that RAM, when you want to upgrade your processor, you would realized your motherboard is not supporting it, so, there is no different or better to buy a totally new one.
I could basically imagine other companies growing around this one... creating custom laptop cases for framework... custom keyboards.. custom components... batteries... cameras...
Great laptop, poor presentation
Why was the graphics capability totally avoided? Seems unbalanced review avoiding the main question
is there's model for Belgium market?
framework can take my money and shove it into their R&D
I took apart my old HP laptop to replace the broken Hard Drive and I now have four spare screws from I don't know where lmao 😅😂
I am just waiting until it is available in the eu
"The Dell is not even f***ing thinner!" got me
You look like the bailbond guy from pattymayo youtube
Would also be great if they kept the main board installation as a standard and offered to the client to just buy a new motherboard instead of a whole new notebook. It would be like a Desktop PC that you don't need to buy a new monitor, keyboard, mouse, case, PSU and in many times the Memory to upgrade to the next CPU/GPU generation. They could even offer a return policy for the old main board to give a discount when you purchase the new one. This would allow them to properly recycle/repurpose those old parts.
Remember when the idea of an upgradable phone was proposed so to reduce the amount of e-waste and allow customizability for the end user to set to their preference? While that idea was quickly shut down by phone/computer manufacturers, because of bull PR propaganda, that same idea was carried over to making a portable PC by the very people who previously worked for these proprietary companies who were so hardcore on keeping their patent hardware secret. I also love that the ease of access to the internals wasn't constricted by some crazy clam shell design that you need a pick or flat tool, risk breaking off some of the plastic bits just to open and close the case. While it's just the first of it's kind, I would like to see how they would tackle a gaming PC. It would actually make me feel I'm getting my money's worth rather than feel like I'm paying for the brand name itself.
This is the critical difference between things that are built to maintained and used, as opposed to things that are built just to be sold. I appreciate it when any company specifically designs things to be user serviceable. There's more value for the end user, less e-waste as you can upgrade/fix instead of replace, and likely an inherent loyalty to the company simply because they said "We got you". I love this.
You know a product is good when Linus pre order it
By far the worst video you've done in a while. I thought the backward hat "I'm an idiot" look died a decade ago.
I am a fan of Framework now! Thanks for this video.
My next laptop will be a Framework laptop if they will provide AMD processor options by the time my current laptop bites the dust.
Sir please make video on how make raid 6 nvme sdd nas
Ugh why does the Canadian prices have to be so much more it really sucks
i don't think i've ever seen linus get so emotional during a product showcase video.. so wholesome :)
They should have given Linux option too :-(
but will they make a gaming one?
Shut up and take my money.
How's the cooling though
still waiting for Dbrand to send you a Segway with your face on it, and have you do the sponsor segway on the segway. FOR THE MEMES!!!!!
Phoneblocks was the same idea but for phones, but seeing this in a computer makes me want to change my recently bought computer, I WANT IT AHHH
They're shipping in the summer? What does that even mean? Is 50 degrees not summer?
Dang, I wanna work at Framework.
imagine if you just drop this laptop on accident
YESSSS!!!! Consumers have been looking for an item like this for YEARS!!!  Thanks Guys for covering these guys!!  Domari Nolo PA III
im still not a fan of the ultra thin laptop design that being said if i had the money i would pick up one
damn ive been meaning to get a laptop for awhile and this might be it
honestly like the idea and product but its ain't cheap.
No GPU? No deal! I mean, if they are going the IGPU route, they should have gone RYZEN. FAR better performance.
"The Dell's not even fucking thinner!" - Linus Sebastian
Its beautiful
Ok this is forking coolllll... I'm definitely gonna buy this one.. 🔥🔥🔥
Reminds me of the old PhoneBloks idea
You know, we have been through this stuff before.  I predict exactly zero chance of this making it even one year. I mean the MXM "standard" (created ~ 2011)was the closest we ever came, and it's all but dead. At this point I'd be happy if I could just add ram, or upgrade a SSD in a laptop. Nearly all modern laptops solder everything to the PCB.
Ngl this looks a whoooole lot like an X1 Carbon but modular. Really dig it!
I'm buying 2, thanks for letting us know about these guys!
This would make laptops actually viable. Heck, imagine if Valve used this on their Deck thing.
Linus almost pulled a Linus move there with the "toss it aside" thing XD
This just looks like if Samsung made a phone
Pog: you have a Samsung
where's the option to upgrade GPU? it should have it to attract more consumers
Could they do something like this that would work well for businesses? Like we have to order new laptops relatively often because they crap out or users drop them and the cost to repair is the same as a new one.
And still can not upgrade the GPU & CPU therefore no different than any other modern laptop
World coming to some sense, finally?! -Wow!..
Where's the MXM slot + heatsink?
I don't have enough money for a laptop... I don't have enough money for a laptop... I don't have enough money for a lapt- I'm gonna have to buy this laptop 😩
Gosh darn, they're only shipping to the US. Make it available in Japan!
im gonna get one when i need a laptop
this is the first video i have commented on from you, AWSOME laptop
yeah, I'd be willing to assemble my product if it saved me a good chunk of money.
08:17 bye
Whelp, I know what I’m saving up for.
from my son: I think it would be cool for this company to make it act like an arduino and/or raspberry pi. when outside it's case (but give it a manual override to switch it back to acting like a normal pc) It would still use the same intrusion detection system, but instead of making it lock out like other companies, this system would make the motherboard basically into a monster sized arduino but with java instead of C++ to make it more programmer friendly? also because computer CPU...    ALL THE PINOUT BUS-BARS...   though seriously, if someone's gunna make a laptop motherboard designed to double as an arduino or other "arduinoid" (arduino's Lilly pad, raspberry pi, little-bits, etc.), then they might as well give it enough pins to make an Arduino MEGA look modest
Hopefully this company thrives and laptop mobo and cpu swapping become a thing again.
If the Graphics were upgradeable it would be perfect
i ronically i got mac ads right before the vid
I hope the price comes down tho
this thing looks great. I don't even have a use case for a laptop and want one.
average overpriced gimmick laptop enjoyer vs average used business laptop fan
That's what I really want in a laptop. When it reaches 100% charged, the laptop will switched to AC mode, leaving the battery full.
This is the future I want
this is great until you realize how much space the port modules take up that could make room for battery, a laptop with decent ports as part of the board would have more internal room for a battery
I am not that concerned with it being so thin or small.  I need a very large screen because my eyes are bad.  I use the machine on a desk so its weight is not that important.  I can carry a few pounds without getting tired.
I would consider migrating to this on the next upgrade cycle when they have a touch screen or some kind of killer widget.
Oh my..
Looked at their website. It's pretty cool, but they need an AMD option.
2 main gripes I have with this thing aside from the obvious uncertain future: 1: customizeable ports are nice BUT 3 (4-charging port) of anything is NOT enough for me without dongles. 2: While the hardware freedom is nice, they have to compete with the software freedom of system 76 for me.  these are very fixable though. if they had atleast one of either USB-A or a USB-C charging port built into the chassis standard that would go a long way to increasing the actual flexibility with the other ports.  -EVERYONE will need to charge the laptop and if you really want it on the other side you can still use a modular type C -type A is so widespread for things like dongles, flash drives, mice, external hard drives, and phones, it is reasonable to assume the vast majority of people will still find use for a single one somewhere on the laptop  -alternatively they could just have 6 ports though that might cut into speaker size theoretically, though they could have made the speakers themselves modular with 2 "jumbo" bays that could alternatively support larger devices with multiple ports or just the regular ports with some kind of spacer to fill the gap. I would trade out stereo sound for 2 more ports personally.   for 2 they could implement coreboot themselves, but honestly what would go a long way, is if they could partner up with system 76 and possibly other companies for alternative parts at some point in the future and instead take on the role as some sort of standardized 'framework' for other companies to compete to create parts and boards for.
Why not make a video about mainboards with integrated UEFI shell? I know MSI boards have it. ASUS probably only with an extra file on USB with FAT32. Does it have a UEFI shell?  01:30 - 02:10 Look at the fair phone it follows the same logic. Manufacturers just have to agree on a standard for PCIe micro interconnects for phones and laptops. Modularity is always possible. The real problem is their greed not that you can't do it. When the board and CEOs and owners suport the wrong thing. Cons: No easily removable battery. Easily meaning from the outside. No Hardware switch to disconnect the battery water damage. The IO modules are not build for a higher port density. Is the mainboard modular? Do they have a CPU and GPU socket that have a standard interconnect like PCIe with a zif solution to use BGA chips in them. Modules for everything sound network V/RAM. Southbridge socket. Interconnect board. Localized keyboards are missing too, so... There are many more things that can be improved or are missing so hopefully they stay in business to make them. Or another company makes them. 08:40 Yes they are called BGA. Make the solder pads thicker and solve the problems with the HF connection to slot them in ZIF sockets.  Yes the privacy shade is awesome and the mic switch too but the port density and the lack of a removeable battery are a dealbreaker. Besides I really like the suitcase style laptops, done right you can use an ITX board in them and a full sized RGB keyboard with a shitload of macrokeys you'll never use.^^ Personally I wouldn't mind a small suitcase laptop if it was a DTR (DeskTop Replacement).
You looked like a kid happily playing with lego... ✌🏻
@4:12 whoa there linus, take it easy.  I almost had a heart attack thinking he was going to drop it lol.
fingerprint sensor with Linux driver?!!?!?
That perfectly rectangular laptop motherboard screams "blade server" once it's past it's laptop life
LOVE IT, FINALLY SOME NO BS LOPTOP🤍💯
Oh my God FINALLY
I love this channel!
This type of laptop combined with the 2in1 functions of the ROG Flow x13 and I will buy it yesterday!!! Finally a company that thinks beyond instant greed.
The humdrum field diagnostically snatch because poison ostensibly mug amidst a addicted reminder. earsplitting, angry fountain
Microcentre sponsor for a direct to customer only product. Lol
What's the name of product, and maximum size, please?
Why would I want those square modules if I have USB ports already
There is hope for humanity after all
11:27  ahaha whats with that look
I need this here in brazil
Its neat and a step in the right direction but not having dedicated graphics makes this laptop miss the mark in a massive way. I'd honestly say that well over 80% of the entire market for a modular laptop wouldn't be interested without some sort of gpu and to be frank a modular laptop without such is kind of a gimmick.
in reality most ppl who buys a laptop just need a computer, web browsering and word ppt excel. You expect them to have a screw driver in their home to fix anything? No they too stupid or too lazy to do that. Good products for enthusiast but not for most ppl. Honestly they dont have right to complain why apple or microsoft prodcuts are so expensive only because they are too stupid to break down parts and assemble pieces back on their own. So money fix it.
Panasonic's Model 55 was out way before this and is much better design that has "bays" that let you upgrade it like this except better. You can have something nuts like 40+ hours battery, super GPUs, IO stuff, antennas, so many different combos. Very modular, and handy.
This is entirely too exciting :D  I'd love it if their USB-C modules could have two C sockets though (I'm on a, like, 7 years old hp at this point with 4 USB-A, a DP, an ethernet, and a few more — granted it's 15″, but it's certainly good to have that many USBs)
Really hope they don't get bought by some big company or start making proprietary parts
@Framework: We will watch your career with great interest!
Arent the modular slots just proprietary usb-c dongles?
It would be cool if they had special hardware decoders and encoders as an attachment  Also you can charge from any of the 4 expansion ports
Super idea!
Wish I waited on my laptop for college....
Yeah I'll prolly get this
this is really cool. i hope these guys succeed.  at the least, I hope they have an impact on the market.
So... the only two things you need to upgrade in a laptop, CPU and GPU, are not upradeable in this "Completely Upgradeable Laptop" ? Yeah, I can see the *no*future of this device.
I love the idea of this, I think the execution is solid, and I hope in like 10 years this is just how it's done. I would love to not have to throw my computer out the first time _anything_ breaks.
Only one little failure with this in my opinion, the video card is not an upgradable part. :( But it does look like they can use EGPU units. Not ideal, but the best we can get at the moment.
First time I've ever seen Linus not complain about anything in the product, that's fucking neat!
I remember 20 years ago it was Compaq vs Packard, Packard was proprietary while Compaq was "IBM compatible" we sold way more of the former for that exact reason
Cool idea, but you are counting out this comapny acutually producing upgraded modules in the future. And modules that are reasonably priced
you are 10 year late.. with mobile ARA system and 13year old from INTEL 'credit card PC' / laptop.. you sux§
This dude sounds like Shaggy.
i have old Siemens Nixdorf Scenic Mobile-510 and you can put CD or Floppy Drive and Battery or Power Brick. idea is amazing
Anybody else paranoid he's going to drop or break the device?
I think I finally found what laptop i need for college
I'd really like to see a Gigabit ethernet port expansion card. Sometimes, I want to have my laptop running a wired internet connection instead of WiFi!
where to order?
I can buy my own RAM and SSD? That's glorious. I loved so much the DIY option. Still i would buy an assembled one because the parts they list on there are great already.   But i'm not buying those because i HATE intel. i7 4 cores? i'm out. Unless Intel fix these names so that they actually MEAN anything.  I hope they can make an AMD one
You use a wired mouse because it is more reliable and reduces RF pollution
Hearing of Linux Drivers for the Fingerprint Reader made me wanna sell my HP Spectre immediately
the idea is good.   wish/hope they make a 15 or 16in model.
you can just say i dont want to buy ram, an os or storage and bring my own and they let you buy it for less?!
What if I don't want a thin laptop. I want a brick, so when I go to swing up the screen, I don't have to hold down the rest of it. Plus, I don't often travel. And when I do, I don't use it while traveling, just when I get where I'm going.  Also, why is there only one Micro Center in all of CA? They need to expand. Including one somewhere between Sacramento and Bakersfield.
I am jumping in now! This Nerd that met you at Tigerdirect years ago, trusts your judgement wholeheartedly, I’m in!
This is friggin sweet.
Just need the AMD version
Looking at the website, this is amazing except they only have a 13.5" display size of laptop. I really hope they come out with 15.6", 17.3", and I think 18.4" as other sizes I've personally used of laptops. Possibly adding more hot swappable ports too, it'd be amazing to have the ability to say connect to 4+ screens or have like 10+ USB 3.0/3.1 ports depending on whatever purpose one might have for those options.
but is is a sustainable business model?
First time I heard you swear Linux.
This is fucking awesome
Can't wait till they bring out a 2-in-1 Laptop with Thunderbolt 4 I/O
It's so cool! I'm hoping there'll be a version with better specs. Would buy it for sure, but I need 15'' for work n some better graphics for gaming.
Apple doesn't like this video 🤣
When you know about a product before linus yet you still watch his video:
he still didnt activated the windows on that laptop lol
thats a ultrabook not a laptop. A laptop have min 15 inch display, more than 2 usb ports, a bluray drive. wow you can install 4 ports. its a feature not a fail
une représentation forte
Since I got my current laptop 1 year ago, not likely to replace it anytime soon, but this was sooooo temptating ngl. Probably the only turn off so far is that u cannot have a internal HDD, and let's be real, this is not even an issue.
Color coded screws! 🤯
What ever happened to those swappable laptop gfx cards that used to exist?
the headphones are only available to people who live in the USA  I thought you were canadian ?
Apple's invest billons$$ in RND but can just let us install sd card in it and complete our maximize storage fantasy 😭
I love how Linus handles the hardware he’s reviewing. It’s like 60% tech review and 40% durability testing.
If they created a 15 inch version that comes with black I'll buy it
Apple has NEVER wanted a user who understands a computer and knows how to repair a computer.
This is the first laptop in a very long time that I can actually get behind without a twinge of shame. Very well covered. I hope they stick around long enough to dominate the space
Lamo the editing at 11:48 is just great
This is so damn impressive... but you didn't mention GPU!!!
Upgradeable gaming laptop with a choice to replace the battery module with another cooling fan module and hot swappable GPU and keyboard would be lit  if it's possible
Ok great…do the suckers sell it with Spanish keyboard layout?
why are there connectors?
ppl complaining about 17:10 saying actovate windows,remember,ltt has a video about why they dont
I love this idea. It'd be great to see a wider range of specs though, like some AMD CPUs. Also; upgradeable graphics? That would be a huge deal. Maybe they could make a "gaming" focussed laptop, where you could just upgrade your GPU every few years like you might do with a desktop.
no
I LOVE THIS !!! TAKE MY MONEY!
To be honest I don't see the appeal.  It's a $1300 laptop that requires assembly, with meh specs, that's had all ports except 3.5mm aux + USB-C removed, and expects you to use adapters for each other type of port you want.  Sounds like a MacBook Pro, with the exceptions that these adapters going inside the laptop case instead of sticking out the side and the MacBook Pro doesn't require assembly.  These adapters are also 100% proprietary.    The part about being able to swap the board is interesting, but irrelevant until they come out with new/upgraded boards to be swapped in.  Until their promised modularity/upgradability is actually realized, I just don't see the point in this thing personally.
Put PopOS on that thing.
just found my next laptop
If they are still around when I buy my next laptop, I will give them a try
I don't need a new laptop right now (I'm home often, and happy with my tiny 11" MacBook Air), but when I do need a laptop in a couple years & if framework has a dedicated GPU option by then, I'm certain they'll shut up and take my money.
Did I miss it or was gpu on the framework not mentioned. I just went to order and I don't see option for gpu's thanks in advance if anyone can let me know
That's great!!
How about tpm 2.0? Can this run windows 11?
This is like linux for laptops... I love it.. opensource the shit out it...
this video literally gave me chills
Is this guy related to Ron Popeil? But wait, there's more! Need another espresso lad?
man i see a new industrial revolution coming. a lot of industries are dying due to mass production short cuts and unethical practices. and it's opening the doors for more passionate creators to get out there and making this stuff happen
my next laptop!
Please post an update on the pricing. Simply comparing the prebuilt and DIY models with the same specs results in the DIY model being around $100 *more* expensive, rather than $300 cheaper, and I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a feature or a bug
lets plug blocks together like we did as 3 year olds and really dumb down computers, chrome books are bad enough with a web browser and that's it, dam kids won't learn anything, the only people that are learning is the chinese in the factories in shenzhen china making those blocks!! I'm glad I grew up in the 80's
No dedicated GPU for $1000? I'm sorry little one
Me: Hey guys my practically brand-new laptop won't turn on? Dell: Your RAM failed, but because it's soldered to everything, you have to send your laptop back to us to fix. Oh, and no, we can't replace your storage because that's soldered to everything too. Hope you backed up your data! D:<
this is how we get to a sustainable future, fully reparable tech
Can you activate windows on this laptop?
Well, I literally hate this "you can't repair your stuff by yourself" trend. Hacked my Lenovo laptop UEFI to override whitelist and now I can use WiGig with my modded router (I really appreciate those PCIe solder pads under the router hood). PS: I hate glued phones, but there's not much alternatives right now. I'm using high hardness wire to cut glue to open my phone… Feeling obligated to master those weird skills.
the aftermarket for this shit is gonna be huge
Brilliant product
I would buy one, if I hadn't a Laptop right now Perfect! Cool would be to be able to buy a Ryzen CPU and having dual USB-A on a single expansion module That would be even better I don't say, I don't think it is brilliant at the moment though Then I would buy it, no-brainer
Do they intend on making a larger size laptop?
what about the graphics?
I already have a Dell G7 which is a very good laptop, but I really want this one too because I know once my G7 will break, it will become an electric garbage
I'm buying one. Shut up and take my money!
and when you want to change the monitor?
I really just hope when a user messes up upgrading the laptop and it does something bad like explode or shocks a user that the media doesn't run that headline and causes massive damage to the company's name.
It's about time.
Linux drivers? Ok, I'm sold, I needed to replace my laptop anyway  Edit: Ahh they're on back order... Well I might wait a bit then and see if they add new options in the next few months. I'll be keeping my eye on them though
Incredible
So what you’re saying is i could buy the motherboard and use it without needing anything else? Or say someone has a low budget they could buy the motherboard and save up a bit more for the case?
As soon as they have AMD version, I will surely buy one.
9:36 u r doing wrong connection bro! Just replace them
omg i want one sdajskfj
Seems great isn't it ? A few questions however : Ethernet ? Bluetooth ? Graphics ? Can I plug it a docking station including charging ? How cool does it run ? Windows 11 ready ? Love the headphone jack :)
I think that’s the first ad that i went BACK 10secs on i had a double take on that case
not a bad price either
I hope they don't get bought out and ruined by a larger manufacturer.
Friendship ended with Dell, now Framework is my friend
I remember seeing a concept of this for a phone some years ago...so glad to see someone doing this...hope they don't sell their company....
Honestly, I’d make this laptop. I’d expose 16 PCIe lanes on each side instead of having the USB-C modules, but I’d make this.
Upgradeable laptops need to be an industry standard for it to be a viable option, otherwise its just a laptop with a bunch extra proprietary parts.
Yeah I hope this will succeed, and too bad they didn't game on it would have been cool xD
I'm sad run they don't have a branch here in the phillipines and I don't have 37k pesos (fyi 37k pesos can buy you a LOT and I mean A LOT even a house if you find the right seller)
I think that there main chalnge is the graphic card as the laptop dosent come wwith a strong GPU like RTX....
Modular io like this is mostly useless. Being able to replace ports easily when they fail is a must, but these modules make no sense. They take up so much space that you’re left having to change them out repeatedly when it would have made more sense to just use that space to have a few thunderbolt ports, and maybe 1 modular connected for special uses. One of the modules is already wasted by not having a dedicated charge port. I appreciate what they are going for, but I’d rather just have thunderbolt ports and have to carry a adapter hub than worry about constantly swapping out these modules when I need something else.
absolutely amazing laptop. this is how laptops should be made.
Upgrading memory modules in my HP laptop required some serious disassembly of the device. It involved loosening no less than SEVENTEEN screws, several of them carefully hidden. Don’t even get me started on painstakingly careful removal of the keyboard and top cover, risking damaging a dozen fragile plastic clamps.
Getting some strong Project Ara Flashbacks 😥 But alas, planned obsolescence shall strike again. Good on Framework to take a jab at the status quo though. Very brave and commendable to show the end user that you can actually use intelligent and competent engineering skills to simplify the assembly of compact mobile devices.
Hope these guys make it big time. I'll be very interested in their products when they get to Europe and I even wish I could invest in the company.
Absolutely worth every cent! Bring to RSA thanks, ill be pre ordering!!!
Love the idea, but have one complaint. What about the video card? I don't see an option to upgrade it nor do I see reference to it when going through the website.
I want this with a Ryzen APU och PS5 like SoC from AMD
The color coded screws are so dang cool, AND THE EXTRAS !!!!!
Amazing product, really excited for the future of this company and it's products. I wanted to know if ( say sometime in the future, the performance isn't on par with the contemporary laptops ) can the laptop owner use the laptop's display as an output display of some other device?  Really hope you ( LTT or framework ) investigate this and reply back. Thank you.
Wow ! This is actually do fucking consumer friendly its mind boggling. I love it and I have to get one
Start building clubs, teach teens something useful.
I can even see a slotted CPU and memory alternative.  I've preached for a long time to the people who insist on having laptops vs. desktops at the office 'Why do you want a laptop? Do you go anywhere? - well no, but it's cooler. oh, and get me a wireless keyboard and mouse while you're at it.'  I always have said - a laptop that you buy today will be the same thing in a few years when you slowly keep upgrading software and then complain about how old and slow it is.   Where a desktop can be upgraded and given new life every couple of years and have a much longer lifespan.  This changes everything.  Edit:  I just scoped one out.  Comes to $2205.  It would only allow me to add one of each type of module.  It's not a guarantee that they will have motherboard/cpu expansions or how much it may cost, so this config is with the highest end CPU currently offered.
But can it game?
This laptop is so WHOLESOME, it's filled with LOVE
That Was Awesome.  Being a Field Service IT tech, I would love to see the folks at my sites have these type of units.  Constant complaints of 'waaaaahhh, I need more memory. I'm out of disk space, I can't connect to the projector in the conference room, it's SO HEAVY - I NEED a new laptop, it's SOOOOO SLOOOOOWWWWW.'    Well, it wouldn't stop the complaints, but the fix would be - OK, (plug in module...) - there, fixed, what else can I do for you?  Bye!  Don't forget to fill out the survey!
Sold!
Maybe I'm easy to please, but the same screw for every internal component is amazing. No remembering which screw goes where.  Also, the battery defeat in BIOS is slick.
I think people like to discard old tech. I think the consumer tech industry is built on this framework. The new-is-better ethos doesn't just drive the industry it is also the essence of the consumer tech promotion business of which LTT is a member. As long as this particular laptop is new it has a chance of doing well. When it stops being new it will just be another item in the landfill.
I dont need a new laptop, I have a 3 year old thinkpad rn, but when I do need one, I'll consider them.
cuuuuute
I hope these guys make it really big so that others have no choice but to follow suit.
Replaceable gpu cards would make gaming laptops worthwhile.
That is pretty cool, more laptops should be like this.
I don't need one but I love this.
I hope asus can make something like this a gaming laptop perhaps.
Framework: Pretty Neat good job boys
Wow guys.  As usual, great content and detailed work.  I am not a fan and wouldn't know you from "Adam" if you were to approach me on the street.  Well, maybe.  I am not a "fan" of anyone outside my immediate realm of family and friends living and dead.  I don't even follow anyone in the entertainment or sports industry.  By the way, this post is for the upcoming release of your next video stream where you rant and rave about people in the "business" not knowing who you are for over 10 mins (might be exaggerating; might not).  The question is, "Do they really care?"  Maybe yes, maybe no.  That said, however, a little humility goes a long way.  I, we (your followers), and maybe some "fans", enjoy you for you.  If you get snubbed by someone in the "business," why worry mate.  It only means, they could care less for who you are or maybe your views of their business and motives. Move on and know that you are one of the best.  There's no need to be hurt when someone doesn't know "who" you are.  No need to thump your chest for attention.  Once you rub their faces in their own poo, they'll know who you are when you next call them, maybe, but then again, maybe not.  We'll pat your back for you.  Just saying, chill out.  You are loved.
Minute and a half in and he's almost chucked the thing already. They need to hire a designated product-holder so Linus doesn't have to touch new products.
Did you say soder? Thats rude. I think you meant solder.
My 2 year old nephew can give a better reference to "Right to Repair" than linus's "Go have your iPhone"
seems you liked that thing so mutch ... you forgot to put a link to it in the description !
I wish framework would succeed and be available in Philippines.
Love it!
This is really impressive! The Price seems fair. I guess, I will have to wait for the German Keyboard Layout and a full size SD-Card Slot.
This look incredible! Putting Framework on the top of my list when my (non-upgradeable) laptop kicks the bucket. I hope when the time comes they'll find a way to offer some low-profile mechanical switch options for the keyboard!
Going to be my next laptop.
Can you upgrade it to have a firewire socket?
Oh... Why a not the possibility to choose an AMD G series CPU :(  With a G series they would target gamer consumers too, not for AAA big games, but a lot of gamers.
This business model will definitely succeed although I cannot say anything about 'Framework'
Only Impel processors though..
I'm sold! Ship this thing to India, Framework! The sooner you get it here the better, this is going to be my next laptop.
where on earth is the name of this laptop and producers????
Linus drop tips 8:15
I love this, I really hope these guys are around for years to come
This is perhaps the first laptop I'd buy post my custom desktop build. I just hope they'll be here 5 years down the road.
wow I am getting one too
I really want one not because I want or need a new laptop right now but just because I really wanna support the company.
11:20 So should I wait until the RISC-V motherboard is available or could I just swap it out?
Yup, I can see myself buying one of these. Hope that they stay in business long enough to do worldwide distribution :D
you say a hundred degrees is ok? (btw, do you mean farenheit or celsius?) well i am uncomfortable if my cpu gets to 50 degrees celsius but a HUNDRED?
Love it!
Nice idea that most people cant even affort… Because price starting from 999$… You can get better Asus laptop with just 600$… So is it so ”affordable” laptop…
I bought a MacBook Air M1 recently and I do regret the purchase. The arm processes are just not software ready.
kudos for this company !
What hm what about the GPU?
11:50 is an amazing moment
So run a graphics card external?
Linus, INVEST
This is exciting
looks like crap
I think these are great nearly bought one but they're not available here yet. My only issue is the graphics I was going to buy one for my lady but she needs a bit more power for Adobe cc really although we could look at a tb external gpu I think that's the thing that's going to hold them back atm.
This is awesome
Apple is going to do this on their next laptop, NOT.
Honestly between this weeks WAN and this video I think I'm going to get the DIY model myself early next year when I get my income tax return. I've been wanting a laptop, I ran an HP Pavilion for 10 years (It easily outlasted my ASUS ROG laptop that was 3x the cost I was gifted for college by a lot) and honestly if I could upgrade that I would have to keep it current - the thing was an absolute trooper. This laptop would be both a fun weekend project as well as something I could realistically use side by side with my Custom Built Desktop. The whole reason I spent so much time making my desktop what I wanted in a case I wanted was I never wanted to need to buy a new one. Now if I need to I can buy a new GPU or I could replace my ram or I could replace the mobo/CPU, nothing in here is going to force a full upgrade and I SUPER appreciate that. If this laptop holds up and can promise me the same longevity I expect out of my PC itself GOOD. I would LOVE for this company to succeed and do well and I would love to see it someday outsell the SIs.
wow.. This is a next-generation laptop.   Impressive indeed
I still got my old beast HP Pavilion, truly the golden age of laptop design.
If those guys manage to put in a swappable GPU and screen, this could be epic.
i feel like we are witnessing the change of an industry
This will be competition for mac as like linux for MS
Great this is the future of laptops
I really want a 3080 gaming laptop.....   I was sad to see no GPU uption at all on the configurator...   I almost want to buy one just to make sure this will be the new way.
Tag Apple please!! eco friendly Mac 😒
okay, what is going on
damn i bought my laptop too soon
Linus drop tips
Pls do review on 2021 asus tuf a15 rtx3060 model
Hopefully they will release this with a 15 inch screen.
HW microtransactions ftw 😉
You don't save $300 if you choose to build it yourself. It's $300 cheaper, but you only get the barebone version, to which you need to add *everything*, building up to a similar price as the base version for similar configurations.  The upside is that you can choose to leave some features aside, like the OS or the storage.
Can totally relate to USB-A on the left for wired mouse usage
nice thought but the price is always too high, so they will not sell much since with this expense you make one at home much more powerful in performance.
Alienware did it first
Shows just what can be designed by enthusiasts with imagination.
This makes me so happy for the future.  We need to pressure apple to let us bring in our current or older notebooks and have them swap out the entire Motherboard with their latest chips, new memory and battery.  I don't wanna pay yet another 6000 for a whole new notebook, how wasteful.
iPhone is actually (one of) the easiest phone to repair, if only Apple hadn’t built in all the motherboard restrictions making some 3rd party parts just not work.
Given the size of the mainboard, it would be great that they create new modules down the line, and take back my old module for some cashback. This could theoretically be long term upgradeable - I can see myself running this for 10+ years just swapping things out and trading in older components for newer ones.
Do all those ports front off a shared USB controller?
Dell??????? I hope you are watching this..... XPS17 please next year....
I reeeeally want to get one but my existing laptop still has some life in it. Maybe in a couple years.
About the cpus, not all laptops have the cpu soldered on the motherboard directly. Just all made after 2012. That's whyI use only machines that are older than 10 years. All the new ones are a piece of crap.
I really hope the company does well
CAN IT BE SHIPPED IN BANGLADESH????
I hope this becomes trendy
Hahaha you can take all of the port but not the headphone jack hahahaha love it
Imagine this gets better, going to be great
Hope Planned Obsolescence becomes obsolete, not possible under capitalism tho :(
God i wish they succeed
Ok so lets take a look at this shall we? Base configuration vs specced up config of say a macbook air. Why a specced up air? Because this thing, in order to get a processor that performs like the M1 needs a 300 dollar processor upgrade. So 16 gigs of ram for both, core i7 for the intel machine, 256 of storage for the windows machine, and 512 for the mac. we are talking the framework comes out 40 bucks cheaper, but then if you start looking into things a bit you find that none of the expansion cards come with it. So you need to add 9 bucks on bare minimum to get a functional machine as it does not have a charging port included according to their site. You can plug into the usb c plug thats in the machine that all of these plug into themselves, but its a hassle and you risk breaking the port cause it wasn't designed for direct access. and to bring it in line with the mac you need another 256 of storage and another USB port. And now we are at the same price, replacing the 256 with 512 on their configurator brings us up another 13 bucks, and the two usb c ports add another 18 bucks. So we are at 1449 for the mac, and 1450 for the framework. Not bad. Assuming self assembly. Yup when it gets here you have to put it all together yourself, or pay 300 bucks to have that done for you. So what are you getting for the same cash if you are willing to build it yourself? Well you are getting a lessor screen for one. The mac has a 2560x1600 screen while the framework has a 2256x1504 >400 nit screen. the framework has a 55 Wh battery vs the 49 Wh battery in the Air. Both have touch ID, both have wifi 6 and such. So really the big difference is in repairability, and performance. This is closer than I honestly thought it would be, but there are some unseen tradeoffs. M1 chips are fast and power efficient partly because the ram is built onto the chip and thus not upgradeable. The mac will likely out perform this machine while being quieter and more battery efficient. This has no dedicated GPU and its unclear if the expansion cards will cause issues with eGPU's. Etc. Not to mention Apple Care is (when you aren't trying to be insane with it) one of the best loyalty repair services out there. Its really hard to call this a good deal, it does however show that until all our laptops are running SOC's, this isn't completely inviable like a lot of manufacturers would have you believe.
Linus running away from the macs at the end was the best part of this video lmao
Beta camera man wearing a mask still 😂
wow amazing laptop
There are several options to a an I-phone, in-fact I will never be on the I-Phone craze due to how late Apple got into the Cell Phone market, if it had been in early 2000's before 2003 then yeah I get it but 99% of brands either made tech appliances like HTC or Samsung or were out before 2003 for the phones not just computers the Way Apple has that were after the colored I-Mac were getting less and less user friendly as well as the company. In fact some of the Samsung or HTC phones people can work on them as long as they know how to in old phones that you can't get the parts for from manufacture, disable the fact it is using non brand parts.
I absolutely love everything about it minus one concern, and maybe it’s just me… I love my games in my free time, and hate Intel graphics. Is there a possibility for a gaming line with swapable GPUs like my old dell laptop?
Major Flaw for me, It is missing a CD ROM spot, that is a very very big one since a few instructional things for stuff I or parents have Are CD ROM and need that.  Major flaw, Also then on most of these CD ROM, one can use the Computer as a Portable DVD player, Blue Ray if it accepts that and so on. I know it is Dying but still one needs a CD ROM for some items, Unless that goes away for any and all Computer like stuff, and for DVD stuff they also force people to subscriptions only not even allowing full downloads of the movie and banning that on YouTube lastly then getting rid of Blue Ray with DVD in them players.
Steve Wozniak would be proud of this
Linus must be a Fubar fan. But, who isn't? And I love this laptop, and I am not a laptop fan.
Good idea, unfortunately pretty expensive.
MSI use to have some bare bones laptops that you could upgrade Video Cards, CPU, ram and storage. However, it was a normal size laptop.
What if one of those QR codes is a rickroll. Hmm
i wish they didnt force you to buy windows 10 with it..
16:20 - Is it smart enough to turn on the battery if you try to power it on while unplugged?
*COUGH "DELL"
Wow.. This is so unfathomable, I thought the title was clickbait
Okay I want to build a pc but this actually has my eye for my portable needs and stuff
The issue is, the laptop is really expensive. Check out the website and play around with the specs, then compare prices to other laptops of the same specs.
How can I invest in this company
What graphics card and what capacity graphics does this thing have?
shameless linus got big add money out of this, mind you 2 years wow be what the add money
omgoodness i want this so much now.
1:58 anyone notice his phone is smashed. Poor guy needs a new one. Also this laptop looks awesome
A person who is loyal to one will use this product for the rest of his life. a relationship that can always be fixed.
You know what's going to happen. All the other companies will kill this concept by marketing it as if they invented it, but releasing badly engineered half-assed versions that put consumers off. Still though, it is awesome that a company is doing this!
Thank you!
I want one, but there's a problem. No discrete GPU. You mention "a big fat Steam library," but that's useless to me with an APU.  I need a "gaming" laptop, and I can get one with a 3080 for the price of one of these, and I have virtually no use for a laptop without a decent GPU.  I have to settle for recommending these for other people until there's a solution. Even an expansion port with a direct PCI connection for an external GPU would be enough to make me pull the trigger. It would almost certainly be more performant than the current eGPU solutions.  I'd love to see an auto-clone feature to keep full backups on storage that can be booted to clone to a new NVMe drive. A second M.2 slot wouldn't be terrible either; it's nice to have a small primary/OS drive with a lot of TRIM headroom.
Excellent work and wish the best
give me more durable workhorse version 2in1 with wacom stylus, wwan, and express card alternative for all this fucking obsolete connectors and you will make best laptop in uniwerse, PLC engineers, embeded programmers, electronics and lot others will buy this, no more shit ton programmers pen drive dongles, im will rip them apart and throw in to these modules also with logic analyzer and gazylion PLC cables to archieve pure harmony in my bag...and track point, do NOT forget about supreme trackpoint
Logitech Pebble M350 MOUSE and Bluetooth is working! Ditch the "Radio USB A Button".
Barring unforeseen circumstances, my next laptop will be a Framework laptop.  I’m mildly disappointed with the design and support of my ASUS laptop.  BTW, LITEON gear used to be cheap crap back in the 1990s and 2000s.  Hopefully it has upped its game since then.
YET, NO ONE IS GONNA BUY IT!
This looks awesome! I went to the website and was picking out what I wanted when I didn't see anything about graphics cards. What is the solution there?
Ok im totally sold on the entire idea except.. this isnt affordable.. it starts at $999 with no wifi antenna even, no OS, no hard drive etc.. its a shell, and then if you work in tech like me and need a reasonable machine it quuckly gets to $2000. So stop saying affordable cuz it aint. Not a fan of google but chromebook is affordable. This has a long way to get to the level of madmax customization and affordability we dream of
Really cool, but it’ll fail due to lack of interested users. Hopefully I’m wrong.
Im more concern on video card upgradeable
PHONEBLOCKs
Me: **hears NAND** Me also: **Thinks of the TWL NAND and the CTR NAND**
Man you are acting like Gordan Ramze
YIKES THAT COSTS A LOT! WHAT HAS TECH COME TO?! Well, I guess it is raivaling the Macbook, and chromebook.
I love this, and I look forward to them having dedicated GPU modules of some kind
Here after the latest WAN show and I want one now.
Wow, what a great company! You should invest in it!
what a game changer!
After watching the WAN show, I really hope Linus shows some kind of support for FrameWork so other companies take notice.
I've never see Linus being this excited about a laptop
Fingers crossed for a slate/tablet frame.
WHAT ABOUT PORTUGUESE SUBTITLES?
DELL
I was ready to buy one! And sadly under the DIY configuration, my only option is Intel :(. I already feel limited.
this level of repairability should not only be a standard, but one enforced by legislation.
The most shocking thing about this video is the fact that Microcenter stall has brick and morter buildings you can goto
just visit their website, i was amazed by the really decent price for performance :O
Please bring this to the EU asap :-))
bro stop now I want one
Oh fuck sake another video where windows isn’t active
I believe in capitalism ,honest companies that provide services and goods others dont, will find their customers and make profits !
They looked at all modern laptops and said: “ ah that’s $h!t”
"not available with pads on the bottom" did you mean pins? they could make interposers for that and use pga sockets
Let's be honest, this isn't a big deal for everyday consumers this is a big move for laptop repair shops that can fix yo shit in about 10 minutes for $5 and a pack of gum
Its like a laptop by Ikea 😂😂😂
Fantastic! I've been waiting for a product like this.
As always, Screw you Apple.
Really cool, just about to upgrade the mem and NVME drive on an acer i bought....now i feel silly
This is some Alita robotic shinanigans going on

This is DOPE! I have been looking for a laptop replacement since I have had my desktop PC, I don't want a gaming laptop, just something that could get light use.
We had the same with this "Lega" phone which you could upgrade.  Didnt it flop?
I got an old chromebook from my dad, he said that the repair guys had said it would take 60$ just to diagnose it. The screen was blacked out. At first I thought the screen-motherboard cable was shorted, but then it continued having issues after I replaced it. I eventually realized that the TAPE that helped keep the cable connected to the socket was a little bit weak and left the plug wobbly. I slapped a peice of duct tape on it and it hasn't ever given me problems since. Maybe it was a combination of a cord short and a plug issure, but I think it was likely just the plug.  What you should get out of this: 1: Tech repair is often overpriced. 2: Chromebooks are also really easy to fix. (Though you might want some experience before you muddle around inside one.)
ill be buying this as soon as its in the UK
Linus: breaking or almost breaking things since... forever
I just spent 1.5 grand on one of these
1:26 linus smacks the laptop
Definitely going to purchase one of these once they offer support for different processors
@Linus, I thought you to be a fan boi for #apple. But here you geeking out over something that doesnt seem to be sponsored. Wow.  I get the visual sex appeal of #macbooks but it is a hard turn off when they ‘upgraded’ past 10.7 and removed useful features. And then started to lock down every inch of the computer.  I mean #SteveJobs was about this but #TimCook has taken this too far.
Ok i think its time to replace my surface pro 6
Lets go framework
This is freaking awesome & beautiful
I get you cram as much into the small box possible to make a phone compact useful product but there is room for screws and an easier disassembly than 'hope to not break it' approach that #apple #samsung #LG #sony #HTC #Google all partake in (if you wanted to repair some feature)..... Specifically it comes down to being complicit and making #ewaste. That these manufactures want to junk up #earth and unwilling to reach a middle ground. I dont demand my phone to be free but I dont want to be polluting either.
Waiting for Intel AlderLake / AMD support and i think it will be my next laptop! Needs to have a Thunderbolt connector.
Yes, I agree.  And don't call me Shirley.
Linus : 'i like the usb port at the left because it's can .....'  Me as a left-hand : ' F** u linus'
Just got a 32gb upgrade for my laptop last week dammit i want this
I hate laptop keyboards in general. I had 2 HP laptops and my arm got SO SORE AND TIRED on them. Too much repetitive strain injury. Just not for me. Sorry.
Bruh why don't we get a powerful laptop with a small battery for laptop power safety rather than portable usage but still as a compact device
I use a wired mouse!
Linus could be a hand model.
If this gains traction this could change everything
and still ugly apple design.
Now we just need them to release a phone!!!
If they can get a Ryzen line I am interested, also must be able to install Linux on it, which I am sure is super easy considering.
I wish we have battery disconnect on smartphone
I hope for an AMD option in the future!
I would refer a fatty laptop if it meant more flexibility like this. Give us hotswappable batteries, exchangable GPU / CPU parts, screen types, etc.
Wow today's sponsor is really making me upset implying I can actually find a AAA graph card :( ... Why G-skill, why??
wow finally something worth to buy always looked at laptops with hate untill now . its actually amazing! thanks Framework
1:07 okay but why a box within a box 😂
Apple has left the chat
For those of us who detest Windows, how does this awesome laptop do with Linux??
Thanks for choosing this asshole 3 button arrow setup - fuck you programmers i guess
The elite laptop option used to be Sager/Clevo. But they got really expensive really quick. While their product selection/options became generic and uninteresting, their product quality became generic and ordinary. Some people are still loyal to the brand - and still pay the increasingly outrageous premiums attached to it - because it was so excellent for so many years. But it looks like Framework is edging into the niche. Too bad they don't do larger (17"+) form factors yet.
I know your young and dont care but could we not take the Lords name?
I hope this is the future of laptops, if thay develop a way to upgrade CPU and GPU it WILL succeed
i'm a mac user (personally for music making but PC for work) and this is a game changer! Let's hope they have some kick arse marketing so they can pick up some market share and scare the shit out of the big players for their complacency and almost dictatorship stranglehold on consumers!
apple should take notes...
Im getting this
Linus okaychamp 👍
Yo Linus went balls to the wall on this one funny stuff keep it up lol
can u add gps tracker to track ur laptop!?
I like the idea of saving a good amount of money just for self assembly. For me that's a selling point. It adds fun and getting it at a cheaper price feels like a good win. I don't typically swap out components even on something modular like my desktop PC, but the main thing most people will swap I think is any different or new I/O interfaces. And from day 1 you can customise the I/O interfaces you need, not be hassled with dongles. Death to dongles!
Dear Framework team,  I don't know if we deserve you but I'm so happy we have you.
Great idea, now make it game.
would you recommend this for gaming?
Do a proper review of it
Hey Linus, I've been a long time fan of your channel, but I call absolute BS on this. I would have accepted if the title was, let's say" A semi-modular laptop that you can upgrade and repair & replace" but you didn't. You went on to call it a fully up-gradable laptop. I do acknowledge it is up-gradable and completely serviceable, but it isn't completely up-gradable. For instance can you upgrade the CPU? or it's cooling or the display or it's battery? I doubt it. Correct me if I'm wrong. Please don't mislead the people with the title.
I want a detachable-keyboard-3-in-1 tablet like these
do they provide a keyboard with full-size arrow keys for those?
if CPU intel, and then no thunderbolt... its not interesting.
I need it.
When was the last time Linus was this excited?
Well, let's go save some bling for when they ship outside US/CA... Everyone who can afford this and want a new PC should give this a go!
It's funny to see Linus asking for the American dollar option when he's such a Canadian bacon. Show us our CAD price! :D
But wait. If the CPU is directly soldered to the motherboard, how is it COMPLETELY Upgradeable?!
No dedicated graphics card, no deal.
This seems really cool, though I'd love to see interchangeable CPUs and graphics.
I was super interested in getting one of these... I ended up getting a clevo, with rtx3050, and the 8core i7... The screen was too small and it would have been almost 2000 for a framework quad core after ram and hdd.... I really want to get into this ecosystem, I just hope they make a model with a bigger screen in the future.. won't be able to really upgrade the Mobo on the clevo, but it was like 500$ ish less with double the cores and a gpu
It’s really impressive. I hope they add GPU options in the future.
These guys deserve SUPER SUCCESS!!!!  I wish them the best!!!
Good idea, it can be an ecological solution.
Settle down on the cocaine there Linus
You can have removable and repairable parts on a phone. There is a phone on the market today that dose the same thing as this laptop. It's called Fairphone.  Also, the reason these things were made to not be repaired was so people would buy more of them. Perceived obsolescence.
Best thing I've seen in ages.
now this is epic
hmm only english keyboard layout and usa power adapter....wired
Laptops in general have been getting more stingy on ports in recent years but four total still seems unusually stingy. Connect a keyboard, monitor, mouse and power supply and you have no ports left for anything else.  They also don't have an Ethernet card option and the moment and have said the Ethernet expansion card will be "oversized", how much of an inconvenience that will be remains to be seen.
Can you upgrade the GPU? 👀
I wish they had a 6 core processor. Maybe in the future.
Looks good and plenty of room for scope open source and secure what I can see
The BEST part, is the only non-modular bit of IO is a headphone jack. 10/10. A++
Someone just press this timestamp 11:53
I see this startup will have some problematic concerns regarding international shipping and worldwide adoption.  I dont see this becoming a standard, not in 10 years at least. But I hope it does succeed
I sure hope the power button/fingerprint sensor is upgradable. My XPS 15's fingerprint sensor died and Dell was entirely no help while it was under warranty.
I'll get one as soon as they launch in Europe! I hope they'll make it soon, because my 8 year old lenovo is deteriorating noticably.
I don't need a new laptop, but I'm tempted to buy this and use it instead of my MacBook Pro. This thing is amazing, and I want them to succeed.
As a hardware tech (no longer working on laptops but I used to) this is the kind of stuff I would have loved to have seen when i was working on consumer / business laptops. I still am scarred by motherboard replacements that took literally 8 hours on Dell systems AFTER you became comfortable with it and knew what needed to go where, the first one would take probably 10-12 hours.  I kind of want one despite not being someone who even needs a laptop.
Very cool
So...  All of these modular gimmicks. where's our modular GPU??
I knew about this 2 months ago :D Ordered mine back then and paid for the rest of it last week
Had 2 laptops and older is hard to repair while the other one has outdated specs. I was just planning to ditch buying laptop and instead build Pc but this one makes me go back to laptops.
I've changed nearly every part on my old laptop (sata ssd upgrade, optical drive replacement, ram upgrade, cpu upgrade, hinge replacement, keyboard replacement and even a motherboard replacement) from 2009 and I still use it daily. While having a Core2 duo 9800 and 8gb of ram is a bit of a bottleneck it does what I need it to do reliably. I did buy a new laptop but it actually lacks features and upgradability. For some reason someone over at Lenovo in the ThinkPad department decided that they should keep the full sized frickin VGA port but move from a full size HDMI port in 2009 to a mini HDMI in 2015... when there's plenty of space for a full sized port. also the cpu is not upgradable but I've only put $300 into it so I can't really complain
I love that the sponsor ads are engineered to be skipped through via a single 5-second skip, and a 10-second skip for the intro graphic. Good fucking job, LMG!!
I love it. Hope it ships internationally.
the cardboard packaging instead of 40 bags of plastic inside one box is also a really nice change!
I hope this guys will be successful great concept !
Yes even I'd vomit when i say dell
I hope this succeeds and forces other companies to catch up
8:19 The real Linus and not Ai confirmed 😂
High praise if the tech reviewer just orders one in the middle of the review.  I put my email in their website, they don't ship in my region yet.
I sincerely hope that it will work, this NEED to become a standard in tech industry... also looking forward for further keyboard dispositions to allow more world wide spread
I wonder is that the New X220?
I had (still have) A hp pavilion laptop and I upgraded processor, WiFi card and memory. Sure I had to open and dismantle most of laptop, but it was quite simple.
11:53 absolutely KILLED ME 🤣
Open source laptop.
It is impossible for these companies... to resist the lure of capital.
Schematics and boardview will be avalable to repair shops.   This adds more repairability,  if your mainboard fails  becoz on 1 cent components, documentation will help you.
sad thing that this laptop is going to be the last one, ppl are just to stupid to see how this laptop can change the game for all of us, but instead the big majority of ppl are gonna buy a well known brand even if its way to expensive
This is possibly the best choice if you looking for a new laptop. Compared to apple...apple is not even allow you to upgrade your memory on an iphone by adding an SD card. They just looking for profit!! I makes me happy that a manifactor have balls and provide us this machine!!!
the problems with this laptop is that I could snap it in half in 5 seconds and its way to expensive, my 2007 HP EliteBook 4gb ram 350gb drive running windows 11 home, half metal chassis, I would rather have this then that thing, that's just my take.
the laptop is about the same price as other manufacturer though...
Well thing is you just have to buy a older ThinkPad. When you have a upgradeable PC.
Is the motherboard/CPU replaceable when that needs to be upgraded?
I've been hoping to see something like this for the last 20+ years. Further than that if you consider Cyberpunk novels, where all you had to do was pull out a part and replace it with a better component that was rated for a specific platform, without playing guessing games on which would be compatible with any given system.
Amazing!!!
Although it isn't yet in the UK I've registered so I know when I can get one. It's perfect for my needs, and something I have been waiting for for years :) The only things I'd add would be a flip screen, a touch screen maybe, and an ethernet port (although I can use an USB C dongle).
we all know the companies like apple want you to throw it away then buy another one and the faster they can make that happen the better (for them)
See that's the thing Linus. The reason most people would still buy unrepeatable laptops like Macbooks is because they don't want to learn! They don't want to put their time and efforts into repairing and making their device work for them. They would rather prefer paying heavy price for someone else to do it for them or just buy a new one. They want everything to just work while they just use the product without even knowing the internals of the product. Companies like Apple are capitalizing on the same mentality. There are a very few enthusiasts who care about their devices this much compared to the sheeps. But i'm glad that's changing.
Any comments on the TPM2 "requirement" would be helpful.
The one thing that turns me off, for now, is that they only have a 13" form factor. Offer me a 17" and I'd be on board for at least one.
Inductive charging claims by Apple and Microsoft seems like nonsense. Toothbrushes and many other devices use the same technique.  Also, that bit of flex easily tolerated by a Framework could be bad for some Apple units.
That's a really nice setup for the laptop
Well they do only sell for US/Canada Market
I wish this was the standard. Ive usually avoided laptops, but I like this
The fact that computer manufacturers have had a 3-4 decades old business model of forcing consumers to throw out hardware because they didn't want to make laptops upgradeable makes them culpable , in my eyes, for the mounds of ewaste that is polluting the world. And the idea that they can, in some peoples' mind, ethically pass off responsibility for end of life to consumers is ridiculous, and borderline evil. Because ultimately, consumers are forced to process their hardware's life cycle based on the way it has been manufactured. And I don't want to even start on how hard it is in many places to even find a legitimate way to recycle your old computers.
Now imagine upgradeable graphics cards!
My concern is this, is the company a computer sales group, or a module systems group? When people size up the usb c connector size, what stops everyone from undercutting these guys? They just become expensive hardware manufacture resellers. I don't know. I'm torn. I love it, but I worry that it might have unintended side effects.
Those usb modules should easily be able to have multiple outputs. Maybe even add extra usb c ports besides hdmi, display port or whatever.  If they add modules like that before I totally forget this thing even exists im probably going to buy one.
these framework guys are legends
Since i don't much care for the battery on a laptop, and just need the bare minimum for a hypothetical power out or move around the house (so let's say 45 minutes of battery should be enough), i'd love to see a battery module that's smaller, and in that space freed up, space to shove in a classic, good old HDD. The space is there, and the latest super thin ones (i think it's something like 4 mm thick) should fit just fine.
Apple: Damn that is actually impressive  Also Apple: How fast can we destroy them?
16:38 - Just a casual fire hazard.
How about standardization of laptop parts like mainboard, gpu-io, battery’s fans and other stuff. Like the industry did on desktop computers for 40 years?
Damn, this thing is crazy. Can it run FreeBSD?
How does that work for the lobyists against the right to repair? :)
Im actually impressed. I even feel sorry for not needing a laptop right now, since I have the money (but recently built a new pc) and I really really like the product, the concept and all behind it. I will probably be buying the next version, if in that moment I need it :D
i seriously tought that Gskill case was a coffeemachine
A Tektronix 465B is much more durable, easier to use, and super easy to service. Also it has that classic 4** series look to it.
Framework needs to have models with the latest AMD 5000 series (3rd generation Ryzen core) APUs.
The Nokia 1020 negates the argument for a "tight" package that allegedly can't be taken apart. Before dying to Micro and Soft's incompetence, they pulled that phone out which proves you can have  a very packed phone that's both robust and easily repairable. The entire screen can be removed by pulling one screw and one rail. So NO, there's absolutely no reason for the greed and garbage of manufacturers.
I hope for a thicker laptop with upgradeable CPU and GPU....
You might think that having every single thing labeled and having a ton of manuals would be educating the end user, but there are many people who refuse to be educated. My 50yo aunt who is a teacher, who teaches a-levels level physics and maths, miraculously become completely illiterate when to comes to anything remotely smart. When a notification pops up on her phone while she’s using it, she waits for it to go away even though it’s blocking whatever she’s doing. And those dialogue boxes with “yes” and “no” selections, she has clicked the wrong one even though she wanted to click the other...
What difference will it make once all these parts don't exist after 2 years? It'll be yet another "modular" laptop on the big "has no parts available" pile.
When you allow Engineers in the Marketing Department.
Bring me one of these with a Ryzen 5800U and you have my money
4:30 We all have that 1 relative who literally becomes illiterate when reading instructions relating to any tech.
This is so sweet, really hope it does well. Also hope to see an amd version :)
can it handle 2 external displays with 2 HDMI ports?  if so, I'm basically sold
Cool topic, great laptop but I dislike your way of presenting it, sorry... Constructive criticism: Please show especially the weaknesses as well. In my opinion a problem with this laptop is that you cannot just use any components from 3rd parties (at least yet) which makes you dependent on Framework as a company and another uncool thing I noticed is that you cannot preorder the laptop with some sort of linus os preinstalled... :( hope these things might change soon  However!! Its a step in the right direction!!! I love the idea behind it. I am going to wait for a little while and then I want to see improvements that really as you say in german "haut mich vom hocker" And then imma go buy it
CPU n GPU still unupgradable....
But, will Windows 11 Run on it?  :)
Framework also fixes the "buy and throw away" problem
Framework just know how to make tech ppl bust
This laptop is literally everything
If only I were in America, I would have it right now
Framework Pls don’t sell the company 😭
Are the switches mechanical? Do they ghost more than two simultaneous inputs?
I'm going to buy one of these the moment it is available in the Philiphines.
A dream come true. I hope this company is still gonna be alive and well when it's time to upgrade my laptop in a few years again.
this laptop is like a slap to Apple's face
Ohh! I love this laptop... I can't wait to have one!
This laptop is open source lol
They just need to nail some good cpu options or at least have a dedicated thunderbolt module with a lot of lanes directly to the cpu. As a Mac user I could easily see this as my next device using Linux.
I am selling my PC gamer and buying this!
interesting for a business laptop, but no dedicated gpu and 4c/8t cpu for 2k euros is a bummer.
this is insanely good
I don't know why they keep making laptops thinner.  Why would you need a super thin laptop?  Are you trying to fit it in your pocket?  Give me a thick laptop with an upgrade-able GPU.  I want to be able to pull the GPU out and put a new GPU in.  Back in the old days we had PCMCIA cards.  Why did they get rid of them?  We should be able to swap a GPU out and in just like the PCMCIA cards.  Or how about a docking station that can attach to the bottom of the laptop.  The docking station can provide a discrete GPU, second SSD, cooling fan, etc.
linus is using a broken note 9 over anything else
Can't wait to see u make it HACKINTOSH  Laptop even better tham M1. Pls Linus install Mac OS Bigsur in this machine!!!!
*I NEED THIS NOW*
It's a chame is not water resistant like all MacBooks are 👀

This is the a shit laptop with shit specs with over the shit price.
I wait and see what they can do with ARM and then maybe I consider buying one
Hope this works, would love to have one in the UK
i would want to buy one but I have to sign or use a pen for PDF's and I would love for a touch screen option to be available
If they keep the design for say, 5 years, and have a modular motherboard. Where I can upgrade the CPU at the end of those 5 years, drop in a 1440p screen. Sure, I'd return. Make the CPU upgradable and you have a win from me.
This is only good for a small percentage of the market out there. Like he said, you can have your iPhone, as long as there’s choice. A laptop like this will fill in the tiny gap of people who want this. This type of modularity is fantastic for them.
The best part when dell skips of his mouth
every laptop manufacturer right now: * sweating profusely *
Commenting mostly to show appreciation. Kinda bummed as I recently bought a Thinkpad x395. It is remarkably repairable but still not on this level. And not upgradable.
My only concern is, it doesn't look like it is doing GPU (Switchable) or even Dedicated GPU.... Dell for Alienware keeps wanting to start doing the switchable GPU (area-51-m laptops) *Second Attempt* but doesn't look like it is getting off the ground as they hope. I wonder if this company can push a more harder approach for those gamer lovers to have someone like this but more in their environment.
Everything looks good EXCEPT WTF KIND OF KEYBOARD IS THAT!!!! NO LETTERS AND TRANSPARENT I HATE IT!
Not to be rude or anything but why the "Activate Windows" at 17:11 ?
If they made a bulkier 17" with MXM GPU's and more slots for stuff overall - that would be a massive slap on Dell's face) And, probably, a good option for people, who still want a somewhat powerful gaming rig/workstation on the go. Damn, i miss my old ROG G750...
1:58 no matter how rich you are, you don't have "enough" to repair your phone's broken screen
My wish is that you do a follow-up video testing how well a non-techy person handles upgrading/customizing this device! Would be nice to trust this enough to just buy one for a family member not having to then do everything yourself for them
If only there was ryzen option I would have bought it… bit expensive for cpu upgrades but tbf its intel
Spring framework of laptops
Shut up and take my money
I need this in my life!
It's about damn time.
I went to their website and i was sad not to see the modules and their prices. I will totally jump on the laptop but i want to make sure the parts are priced right before committing.
Now this is huge
These are getting popular many models are sold out for a few months now! Nice to see true improvements in tech!
I know he knows what he's doing, but I don't like how he manhandles the laptop. :/
Not taking orders from anyone outside the North part of the American continent :(
See... This is what happens when engineers _not_ accountants and marketing people design a laptop. I'm seriously thinking about getting one.
I really hope this succeeds. People are tired of being strong armed by big tech, and an upgradeable laptop is a big step towards taking power away from the incumbents.
if companies did this earlier they could've made money from upgrades and customization instead of new laptops entirely.
can you upgrade the graphics unit in future? NO. its an apu. so why buy that? its useless if you cant even upgrade the gpu. you can upgrade the ram and the ssd of nearly every laptop. why do I need to change the i/o units? I can use an usb c dongle. this would be future prove for 10 years or more. a laptop without an upgradable dedicated graphics card is not upgradable. I understand that is hard to upgrade the cpu. even on desktop pc you have to change the mainboard in most cases. but the gpu is easily upgradable on desktop pc. so in conclusion this is just like every other (non apple) laptop out there. you can use an extarnal gpu with usbc support. and then upgrade that in future. this is the only way to upgrade a laptop today.
yes please reduce e waste
Can you game on it?  Like gta
Hope these guys do well!
I want that thing, with a Wingdings keyboard
I the motherboard replaceable?
Discrete GPU support?
I don't see the possibility to change an apu? Is that available?
stop shaking it!  >:-(
You look like my uncle that would take me fishing
You people look like fools with masks on.
this laptop is the opposite side of mac books... but both are in greatness nearly same lvl...
Awesome :) It will be nice if Framework teams up with PURISM, to create a great user-friendly product :) Secure, repairable & upgradable :)
Why say "without further edu", then go on and do something completely else? (some people pay for the content already...)
The battery is not a compromise when you can simple just replace it...
i love this
Hope they survive long enough time on the market to develop replaceable CPUs and GPUs.
I really hope this becomes a huge success and even great other competitors forced to adopt this idea 😄
yayyyyyy finaly some good content. i want one of this
I have to disagree with the sentiment. This laptop still is severely restricted in functionality: - 4 of these bays are not even close to enough. My current laptop has 2 USBa, 1 USBc, 1 HDMI, 1 miniDP, 1 ethernet, 1 SD/microSD, 1 SIM, headphone jack, mic jack and charging port. It would require a whopping 9 (!) of these bays to reach the same level of functionality. I use all of them except miniDP and i still wish i had an additional USBa port and a VGA port. - i doubt a full-size ethernet plugin will ever be made. or VGA. - the battery can't be easily detached in and out like on old laptops. i used to carry two batteries that i would swap when needed, that's how you last a weekend without charging. - no internal SATA bay. I guess that's for the best, given that the lack thereof allows for a bigger battery, yet you wouldn't need a bigger battery if the above trick is employed i suppose. However, if there's one company that can pull it off, it's probably them.
Why would you buy a segue to a sponsor?  Doesn't that defeat the purpose of sponsoring??
This guy is awesome.  I remember  before I watched him  My brother showed me his creeper pc building  video and I'm like: I'm gonna watch this guy more
Linus just some advice from a long time viewer:   When you are touching or doing something on a device like on this video, the camera should always maintain the tight shot of what you are doing.  But, the camera keeps switching from a tight shot to a medium shot showing you.  That takes our perspective of what you are doing away from us.  The best example of what I mean occurs at the 9:13.   I see that happen in a lot of your videos.  Zooming in and out constantly for variety is over producing.  Just a thought.
Are you in kitchen???? 😒😒😒😒😒😒
Are they planning on implementing a dedicated video card in the future? I checked out their site but could not find it.
How to make a device un-repairable at all and how to justify it by any means  - billions of R&D  👍🏽
I support Framework.
This isnt even exclusive to Notebooks! Check out Fairphone from Germany!!
UwU
I started to get bored at Linus, and tech as it is just about computers. There are a lot more out there that we should explore.
working on laptops over 10 years, I could tell you back then they just wanted you to buy a new laptop every other year. they have been getting away with it, this whole time. how ever with a company finally making something swappable well lets hope it catch's!!?
NOICEEEE
this IS something
No disk drive
after 11 years, now im interested to buy my 2nd laptop
I checked quickly on their website the characteristics. It seems to be a very good computer! I would consider in the future to buy this one if I need to change.  I’m just a bit worry how the computer will accept new technologies. I guess you could keep it for years if you replace progressively defective elements. But does the new technologies will be easy to integrate? (I’m a bit confident it could be easy to integrate them since laptop change slower than phones these days.)
i use a wired mouse
I'd buy it if not for a fact that I have a pc
I hope that this company stops the trend of laptops and phones being a solid impossible to repair piece of junk
This is what we call open source laptop.
This is great! Only setback for the rest of the world (for now) will be the local availability. I'm sold as well
this.is.dope!
This guy is 5 years ahead of the world
Modular things just NEVER seem to succeed sadly. Let's hope this can catch on, but unless a BIG company like Razer, Dell, Asus, Google, Microsoft etc. (This is COMPLETELY NOT something APPLE would EVER do lol) take it up, it WON'T.
Would love to buy one, except A) I need a different keyboard layout and B) a different power adapter
you use a wired mouse ok boomer
So are these literally just USB 3.2 ports? Can I plug a long cable into one of the ports for whatever? (not that this makes sense to do)
damn why am I running minimal software only? I wish I could justify buying such a powerhorse with such good of  a philosophy behind it!
This would actually make me want to buy a laptop again. I can change and do what I want over time to keep the machine running.
In an alternate reality: Yeah i'm gonna just go head over to the computer store and grab a micro GPU for my laptop. All the regular names sell them and they're standardized so they fit in every laptop. They're the size of a credit card. This company could make that a thing. Someday.
Impressive this piece of Hardware is a step in the right direction.  I hope it will hit the market like Compac's first portable device.
I work on many laptops and holy shit if this became industry standard my life as a Technician would be so much easier. No more ripping out. Motherboards because little Timmy put peanut butter in the US. Ports, I just pull out the affected/effected port and clean it vigorously.
Is this integrated graphics or dedicated gpu
Yeah now Apple can go screw themselves.
Yeah now Apple can go screw themselves.
Do anyone read Terms of Services anymore? Or EULAs? Or License Agreements?? or any of that nonsense?  I like to call it terms of nonsense, License of nonsense and bullshit agreement
When my Dell gives up I'm getting one of these for sure!
Me watching this video: Yes, yes, yes, YES, (only intel 11th gen) okay whatever, YES, YES... No touchscreen support NOOOOooooo!!!!....
Apple uses their time and money to dev equipment to be impossible to repair, thats their main goal.
Impressive. Hope this catches on.
I ripped of one of the contacts of my wireless anteanna m.2 but luckily I belive it was bluetooth because wii still works, I made this comment on a dell that I broke said antenna on.
God please make this succeed so my future brethren don't have top suffer like I do with laptops
That end user trust clause, so beautiful
Good reveiw for teenagers
the diy laptop.
I’ve only watched half this video and I’m already in love with this product. If I was to design a laptop, this is exactly what I would want (I’m a Senior electrical engineering student). And as someone who grew up using and repairing pass-me-down apple laptops, this looks so much nicer and more user friendly!
This is my next computer. So want to be able to swap out a keyboard or broken connecters easily. Not being able to buy parts should be illegal. Just hope they don't get bought out and closed down or have their component suppliers forced to stop supplying them by the big guys.
I'm surprised that nobody else really thought about this until now... The idea was always presenting itself and it seems EXTREMELY USER FRIENDLY AND CUSTOMIZABLE, why didn't Apple, Dell, or even  Google or Lenovo think of this?!
1.3k dis  why??? btw thanks ltt for making a vid on Framework.....
@linustectips  please make this the future of laptops, and please tell them to make a socketable cpu instead of changing the whole motherboard on their v2.0 of this laptop, also the keyboard for azerty instead of qwerty,
guys please do buy one. <3
I will switch to this laptop once mine comes to the end of life. Hope by that time they will offer GPU options as well.
So Framework's busniss model is essentially running on real world DLC. Yeah, gonna make a mint.
Screen has  3:2 ratio, wonderful. If only I can choose a keyboard with PageUp and PageDown keys and a trackpoint...
cannot upgrade to 102 keys keyboard ... :/
I think I just found my next laptop. Here's hoping they ship to Australia.
No Keyboard selection yet and power adaper for non US/canada. NoGo yet. The best would be a adapter with more than 1 USBc on it. most likly anyone is using full speed on both ports at the same time. But you would have more ports :)
really cool idea! Hope it succeeds and they release more expansion cards such as VGA and Ethernet ports for example. Only problem with this is that there are 4 slots for the cards though but I think it would be rare to want more than that depending on the user and there's definitely a workaround to work with it in an office environment.
Did that keyboard have transparent caps?
What would happen if they had Apple‘s R&D Money 📈📈📈
This won't take off sadly, the big manufacturers are doing what they're supposed to in this system, maximize their profits at the expense of people and the environment. It's much more profitable to make short lifespan crap that breaks quickly so need to buy new one. Which sucks for us, but if you ask are they doing something wrong in this system - you can't say Yes, yes it's wrong.
I can see years of frustration here. 😂
Thank you for this video... I'm on the mailing list... can't wait till they ship to down under!
Laptop manufacturers just have to stop souldering ram, making everything touchable without melting glue or shit and put replaceable cpu/gpu chips. Because storage is usually easily swappable. Except you have a surface, then dumb to be you
Ya also will look at the MNT Reform open source laptop ?
Imagine not selling your soul to XFX
After upgrade, what do you do with old parts? If I can sell, that is good. If not, I just dump inside a drawer and left to rot. I will rather buy a new laptop, and give the old one away since it is still working as a whole. If it is getting too old, I just convert it to ChromeBook.
Next step to build would be upgradable GPUs and maybe CPUs, but that would need support from Intel or AMD...
My next laptop will be one of these, without question.
Patents are such a shitty idea. All they do is disable competition and economic growth.
I am looking for a new pc that is rbg so can you help me with this problem?
They should sell laptop skins
Шторка на камере. Хардверный переключатель микрофона. Болтики-болтики-болтики.   Инженерное порно.
i saw you throw dell logo XD
When engineers design a laptop instead of the marketing department.
Still not in Australia...  PAIN
not like appleeeeee OOPS hahahaha
Feels like I'm watching Linus build PC again.
Another gimmick that will amount to very little, unfortunately.
I also hope for this to succeed, don't get me wrong, but... clumsy people exist. The all-in-one aspect of consumers technology is a pro for companies that don't want to struggle with warranty issues, repair issues, etc.  I can see some techy 12 yo that will break his mom's laptop because he wants to upgrade it alone, or a not very techy man that will break the insides and lose everything he got because he wanted to upgrade a component. This alone is kinda positive, everyone should be able and capable of upgrading BUT the company that actually sell these will not have a great time with that...
Totally botches what right to repair means... nice. I thought it means you have the right to buy the parts to repair the product from the/a supplier. Also not giving tools so that when serialized components are switched. Your device will work as normal.
Where is the GPU?
Definitely going to be looking at Framework for my next laptop upgrade. I just went through a very annoying process to do something as simple as fixing an RGB light on my current laptop, where the manufacturer said I'd have to send it to their service center hundreds of miles away just to screw in a 2cm pcb. (ended up ordering a similar part on ebay harvested from a dead laptop of a slightly different model).
Wow you finally caught up to this laptop. Gratz!
Xiaomi uses GaN (Gallium nitride) chargers
8:24 also a USB-C to 10GBit NW Card there?
Linus Drop tipszzz
Probably the best tech video to date
11:55 LOL
I'll get this when the build quality is as good as a MacBook, so basically never.
What about gpus?
Linus please keep on ''not saying anything'' )))
I won't be too surprised if dell or acer purchased them and shut em down
I definitely want this type of laptop...... We are moving upward in lots of technologies.... Still someone do not want to have feel experience of those
Bare minimum you’re looking at an 850 dollar laptop that’s completely modular that’s cool but the price is way to high for me I think they’re trying to take advantage of what people want and then charge them for it hell a chrome book isn’t nothing to brag about but gets the job done hell a 850 gaming pc built entirely of allie express would be worth more of the investment than this that’s too much money for a modular laptop in my opinion then again if you have the money go for I think they’re cool but not at that price range
If I was gonna buy a laptop, this would be my purchase. That price point with Those features is unreal.
11:30- 11.35 ..  🤣🤣🤣
Love it
I would love to see if there's a way they could fit the cpu/chipset onto some ZIF slot mezzanine card that ultimately wouldn't increase the thickness much. It'd make upgrades much easier.
That's quite nice, but the $300 price difference between the i5-1135G7 and i7-1165G7 is nuts. Intel's "Recommended Customer Price" (customer, not OEM) mentions a difference of only $117. And it's not like they have different TDPs to require different a cooling solution, so that's a bummer. Oh, and the "spoiled" European in me also dislikes the 1-year warranty. There's a minimum of 2 years of warranty for this kind of electronic equipment here, so even lacking an extra warranty option is an issue with this laptop - for me and other "spoiled" customers. Hey, it's overall an obvious good step towards the customer, but I hope they will do more in the future.
I am super freaking impressed with this! They have my attention! UPDATE: I went to their site and did a run through to purchase the top tier machine. You are about $3K for top machine. And that is building it yourself. Or you are well over $3,200 at that point. While I truly enjoy their ideas and the flexibility, that is A LOT of money for a machine with those specs. You could build your own way more spec’d out for far less. 🤷‍♂️☹️ I do wish them success. And maybe prices will come down once they start to sell a lot of machines. 👍
Just shut up and take my money💵
"You notice how he avoided showing us whether it plays Doom." - Troll
I'm trying to roll these out to my clients in the future wich makes my job as IT supplier alot easier.
Send it to Louis Rossmann for inspection on repairability.
Damn, I'd def be buying one if I needed a laptop. Hopefully they'll still be around years from now. It's either this or the Surface.
ive been keeping tabs on Framework for a while now. don't need a laptop currently but i plan on getting one from them when mine gives up... and when they open in Australia too
Thin devices cannot be gorgeous. They are ugly, gross, form over function crap.
Making Chinese manufacturing sweatshops look fun & interactive
What shade of blue are those cabinets?
Can you upgrade the graphics card?
If they make a 15" version with numpad and a dedicated GPU I am all in!
@17:26  So their business strategy is that people will come back to buy new upgrade parts from them... because they can't get them anywhere else.  Kinda like any other proprietary hardware?  Neat. Modular proprietary hardware.
I love the laptop but not for $2,970.00
Shut up and take my money.
Wish the screen came in larger sizes.
Is it suitable for gaming ?
From an enterprise standpoint, this looks like a really great idea, creating continuous upgradability for the bits that need it, andsimply replace a part that fails. Large long-term savings in overall cost of ownership seem feasible. I think yearly budget-wise this would be a very sensible way to go.
Never heard of this company and I'm already a huge fan.
❤
As awesome as this is, this will not succeed. Consumers do not care about repairability, and they are more than happy to cough up another $1000 or so every couple of years. Even if everyone who cares about this stuff buys one, they will likely not get anywhere near enough sales to cover costs, especially when laptop margins are razor thin. Since you will need to use their upgradeable thingydoobies, you're stuck in the same boat when they go out of business - a laptop with no real way to upgrade.
Linus is still terrible with segweys. Its good that some things never change.
Can u play minecraft on it? Over 60 fps?
Damn, this is the first time that I've seen Linus like something so much that he purchases it for himself.
Thanks you Linus tech tips for the awesome informative video... Really jazzed about the product. Awesome coverage by the team.....lots of love
This laptop is honestly my new favorite piece of tech out right now. I hadn't even heard of the company before this video and I'm already deciding to shift some money into saving for this thing.   This is simply amazing. The company is literally providing an insane amount of transparency along with everything a customization seeking customer could want. Insane. Will buy in the future.
Although as stated, most laptops already (or still) have replaceable memory and hard disc the design overall is awesome, it clearly proves that modularity and replaceability can be done without sacrificing anything and in fact making lot of things easier for the end user. For example the bios option to disconnect battery altogether - with modern battery management circuitry, the effort to implement such feature is surely trivial but against the planned obsolescence tactics (simply letting the battery needlessly wear out). Framework's design philosophy would surely reduce the environmental impact of the modern disposable electronics and should be enforced to be mandatory in all appliances by local and international laws. I remember hearing about such thing being planned in the EU couple of years back and really hope it only got postponed due to covid-19.
Nice build. But bios is look like a old version.Not sure it will support UEFI and other security features
No gpus??
Please, please, PLEASE let this take off. I love it.   *checks to see if pre-orders available in UK.* *mild disappointment* *signs up to mailing list in the hopes that they will start taking pre-orders soon*
I really don't get people's obsession with laptops being so thin, are all these people malnourished 60lb weaklings who live in cupboards? I have desktops for the simple reason that laptops are a garbage investment compared to spending the same amount of money building a desktop. In fact I really like some of the homemade laptop builds I've seen (built in a briefcase for example) that are far from thin or light, but use full power desktop parts. This is admittedly pretty cool though. I don't want to touch my screen so that's not a con for me. I would want it in black, also I would want some RGB and the logo on the back lit up as well. I don't mess with Intel though, so let me know if they ever have an AMD version.
Wow. At $749 it's a lot cheaper than I was expecting. I think this will likely be my next computer.
Honestly it looks great, yes ! But I would’ve expected the CPU to be upgradable. Hardly any other component fails that easy but after 3-4 years you might want a new cpu
Any plans for GFX card?
The future is now.
It brings the serviceability of business laptops and the upgradability of desktops into a nice package. And it supports right to repair. I'm totally down for this!
I am really thinking of buying one  Only ittle thing missing for now : a gamer version, but hey that's the first one ! Gamer version should come at some point if this one is buyed -> Means I NEED to buy one
Pirated Windows go brrrrrr
Linus you need to buy lots of these in the name of technology  advancement
Yes 🥰
Lord, this is my dream laptop.
In future iterations, they could make screens options, so that you wouldn't need a whole other laptop to switch from 1080p high refresh rate VS 4k , but just a magnet/easily replaceable component that would be endlessly upgradable.  So much expandability to the concept, that shoudl've always be the tech standard.
I work as a computer reseller, I think that everyone should learn to repair their computer. Just simply basic SSD or ram replacement should be mandatory. Its fortunate that most of the modern mid range laptop still have that option. Especially business laptop, although most of them are moving toward slim design which sacrifice the Soddim type RAM. But luckily not all of them are.
This kind of initiative, is what genuinely makes me use this expression unironically: "That's what brings back hope in humanity in my book."  I'm likely to proceed to the best way of making it sustain....             →         shut up & take my $$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Ok I want to buy this. This is my next laptop
hope they also invest in built-in numpads
am i the only one who thought that PC was a coffee machine?
Finally, some good fecking tech
Ah yes... IKEA-like assembly laptop
yasuo
This is such a cool concept. I bought a gaming laptop almost a year ago, but my little self would love this stuff.
so, later down the line, i would expect to see an upgraded motherboard that you can easily just swap out.
All device suppose to be built compatible to upgrade for future use to reduce toxic of waste for environment
Add an upgradeable mobile gpu module and I am all in.
If they are doing this with an ultrabook, I see the return of the MXM platform to the masses on thicker models. Imagine big AIB manufacturers making MXM GPUs.  Sorry I was dreaming too high.
why are your dudes still wearing masks like a sheeple drone
Webcam is Logitech c920 Quality
amazing review, awesome box. How the heck are there 1.3k dislikes? Did Apple and Dell have a company outing??
Please bring this to Europe soon!
apple fanboy: this is not fair.........
I'm really excited about the concept, but I'm not one for rinky dink laptops with tiny displays. I would like to see this concept in 15 or even 17 inches, and for me, a full keyboard with numpad is a must.
This has to be the future.
that's one of my MAJOR issue when i'm considering going for a laptop.. sure it's portable  but heck i care hell much about upgradability. It's just not wise to throw away components that would just 1-2 years old just cause one is broken or outdated. Having to use tape to cable manage sometimes when repairing a few laptop i'm happy to see someone even if it's not the big names Dell doing it.  This is the right way for the future.
11:12 Intel?!?? No sale.  WTF. Where's the real (AMD) one?
Now we need a Ryzen-based MB, 15.6" display and a full size keyboard. My new laptop has all that.
This is what you get when a company thinks more about its consumers than its profit margins
man it feels like seeing the old IBM Thinkpads come back to life!
I like the pdt. Full respect to engineers who are trying to save our money and get finest pdt suited to our needs
id really like to see maybe a external graphics card slot where people could use desktop video cards with it.
When engineers gets to decide, and not the freaking product management/sales department, wonders happen xD
Those keyboard looks like my laptop keyboard only after years of torture while gaming.
I will buy one with arm or RISC-v chip. I already have an x86 Intel trashbook. Shit heats crazy. Can't afford another toaster
why they still wearing masks
If I needed or could afford a laptop I'd get one. I can only build desktops cause I use scrap parts but if this took off and became the norm I could collect left over scrap parts and build my own lol
There was that little golden age where you could get a dock for your thinkpad and it would throw the pcie bus in there and you could put a full graphics card in there.  >its USB-c Oh boy.  Last time I tried to upgrade the wireless on my laptop I had to download a cracked bios that removed the hardware whitelist because it refused to boot with non lenovo hardware
Can't wait for a gaming variant
I WANT TO INVEST IN THIS COMPANY
this should get soooo much attention ...it NEEDS to get it
>2010 looking piece of crap  * *angry Thinkpad X200 sounds* *
It's amazing that the people who help him make videos still trust Linus enough not to break the product he's reviewing.
It's funny how he complained about the screen not being touch, but when one comes out he can just swap it.
Hm what about GPU upgrades still missing
I don't even need another laptop, I got one this year. But hell I love what they are doing enough to gift my current one away to a relative who needs an upgrade, and cop this for myself just to put some cash flow into this fantastic company.
Just don't go public, this company will be shorted to oblivion by [REDACTED]
Well I know where I'm going for my next laptop
The XPS 15 L501x (2010) had the ability to disable charging via BIOS as well. Not sure why this isn't standard across all laptops! It's a must have, especially for gaming laptops.
Look I don't mind watching your videos but do you have to shove your face in your thumbnails? It's super creepy
I'd like to see a larger model!
How many years until they are bought for 500 million dollars, by a "big-box" company, and then nerfed?
Semi-Truck maintenance vs consumer Automobiles.  One wants to help the mechanic to maintain/ fix/swap parts & get truck quickly back on the road.  The other wants to slow/confound/consume time of the mechanic, & encourage the owner of the car to buy another car.  Laptop makers are more like consumer Automobile makers
Me: looks at ThinkPad...how long until I can justify replacing you.
11:33 Dell.... This was perfect
Awesome concept/product. My mid 2014 Macbook Pro is still killing it (other than its terrible processor/graphics), but I might need to get one of these!
Fun fact, Volta makes magnetic tip charging cables. They aren't that long though
Very good, it's long past time for laptops to take a step into the future, and when I say this it's not just getting thinner, it's getting configurable. I never thought that in the 21st century I would see a notebook so small and thin, configurable like this. The creators of this laptop are to be congratulated, they managed to overcome it. I would like a 13.3" version of it with a 16:10 screen.
As someone who repairs laptops a lot... this thing is a dream come true!
4:53 because they basically just got a bunch of parts, put together The same thing that Apple could do with their OWN good parts, which they don't because its "better"(money-wise) to ship out a new macbook every year
Please do some updates down the road like every 6months atleast.  I hope they bring AMD in the future also
I want to get one, but i already got a Surface Laptop 3 about a year ago, I'm hoping they definitely stay in business in the future and only improve because if so, I'll definitely get one
I liked that I could upgrade my memory and replace my failing drive on my MacBook Pro. Later my daughter wanted one. I found out modern MacBook Pros have the memory and drive space soldered to the motherboard. Apple made their laptops less serviceable and upgradeable.  I’m loving the configurable laptop.
8k coin for this item in my currency  In a place where fresh graduates earn 2.5k if theyre lucky.  Im afraid I cant afford to love you meaningfully.
I remember Project Ara
Did you buy the sponsor ? Or did the sponsor buy you ?
18:19 I must say, I _really_ appreciate seeing some capering in your content. We could stand to have a little more gesticulating... But, baby-steps, right? xD
Can't you have the same kind of modular features with Panasonic toughbook 55?
Putting this on list to check out when I need one ...
Like the only thing would be is that screws can loosen on the trackpad however that'll happen over a super long time and you can just tighten them again
WOW, just a few days ago I had a situation in a conference call, where the mic wasnt switched off even when i clicked mute and i answered my phone. I was thinking why not have  a physical mic-off switch.
11:53 Whoever made this edit  deserves a raise 😂
I do the same thing with my mouse!!! The reason? Because back in the day wireless mouse drains my battery way too quickly so now I don’t trust wireless mice(/mouses?)
Reminds me with Google's Project Ara
One reason this product doesn't deserve a ten: it's not on the market yet. Take my money!! On a serious note, kinda dissapointed that replacing the CPU warrants a whole motherboard swap, but I'd still give them 9.5/10. Oh, and the usb adapters only having one port when there's clearly room for more (2 type As, and at least enough room for 3 type Cs) but that's not enough to take off points for. I would LOVE to see an AMD version as well, that would be siiiiiiick
I really want to buy one of these to support framework and the right to repair movement, but I don't need a laptop at the moment and I'm a kid, so I don't have any money. However, I will suggest this laptop to everyone I know that needs one.
every other company laptop sales drops by 100%*
10:30  So is the Battery clued down or not ???
Honestly going to configure and order... I finally have found something worthy to replace my 2013 MacBook Pro (13" Retina).
It's not a matter of trust on end users (although they may claim so), but is just Planned Obsolecence.  They have always had the posibility of making thing serviceable by the en user, but they actually invest on Planned Obsolecense.  Big tech always has done it since the light-bulb consumption began to drop due to long durability.
Havent seen Linus be this excited for a looooong time. This was Nice ❤️
Being in IT for 15 years... i love this.
It's as upgradable as my old Dell. However the Dell weighs 3.7kg and is a fricking tank 😅
I have an old Toshiba Satellite laptop with a Core 2 Duo socketed PGA CPU (no heat spreader). The thing consumed 35W at 2.7GHz and so needed a greater thickness to accommodate the cooler fin stack. Point is, it existed, it can exist again.
After watching Rossman's clinical analysis of this, which was good, seeing Linus's excitement for this is freaking awesome!
Been looking for a replacement for my potato laptop for a while now, think I'm gonna buy this
This is the part of "going green" that big corporations don't want: The ability to fix what you have instead of tossing it in the recycle bin and buying a new one. This makes me wonder if the phonebloks project back in 2013 was actually possible. It's too bad that the idea was killed in it's infancy.
My old dell e6400 has a upgradable cpu socket.
Those excuses NEVER held any water, to be perfectly honest.
Give this company ur money
What about the GPU? What are the specs there?? Is it soldered on?
i really like this but... GPU... is that modular? can you add a GPU into this laptop? i'd like to run my Unity projects into this thing.
this is fantastic, i wish this company gets the success they deserve
The cracked note 9😭😭
If they launch one with GPU, it will be perfect!
u know what they spend on R&D             GREEDISGOOD 999999999999999999999999999999
there was a movie called "Scanners".....  and the money shots were people heads exploding.... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO... we cant have repairable and upgrade-able laptops.... because....um...noooo ....thats un.... MERICA !!!.we need to subsidize landfills and CHINA !!!.. Or..... OMG ITS ABOUT FREAKING TIME..... YESSS.....WE ALL NEED TO BUY 5 RIGHT AWAY TO SCARE THE PISSSSSSSSSS OUT OF APPLE
It just need a graphic card, ethernet jack and more than 4 io. But really great start !!!
Oh my god, I would love so much to have Battery Disconnect option in my laptop!
That's what we need to go back to on every thing. It would be nice to get a new battery for my phone without going to a technician.
does this run windows 11 is the support on the level of asus?
I was a little worried about how much the add-in cards would cost, but it's US$9 for the USB cards and $19 for the MicroSD/display-out. Am a little disappointed that there isn't a 2×USB-A hub to help remediate the limited port count or an ethernet card, but those could certainly be added or modded in later. And maybe I'm just used to 15" laptops; this is a 13-14" class laptop under the 3lb mark with more ports than the XPS 13 (which is about 3 ounces/100g lighter).
We need to start a war on Apple regarding I/O dongles. In the words of Gordon Mah Ung: "So like, are you still a loyal Apple fan after getting f*cked like that?"
What laptop was that at 0:14?
As someone who's working on an older gaming ASUS laptop, I really see the appeal and benefits to this. Also, everyone in the comments is saying that they want to see this company succeed, as do I, but how many people are really buying these? I'm not in a position to buy one, but with this video, I'm also sold.   Oh yeah, also, I know some even older laptops have upgradable GPUs, I wonder if these will eventually get those too! Imagine the upgrade path and not to mention convenience of being able to take advantage of both AMD's and Nvidia's technologies!
I hope there are enough people who are weird enough to prefer upgrades to buying shiny new things, but not so weird that this can never meet all their criteria.
This is a game changer!  Such a good company! Pls promote!
14:42 best explanation in a nutshell EVER
I would jump on this from Mac if they had a more rigid charging solution than USB C. Apple shot themselves in the foot when they did away with magsafe and if someone else offered a similar solution I would consider it a main selling feature. Every laptop I have had other than the magsafe I have had to replace the DC jack or port at least once in its life often multiple times. A clear case or deck lid option would be a cool to go along with the clear keyboard.
Every farmer a blacksmith. Every driver a mechanic. Every user a technician.
Will it play Most AAA games on Steam?
next up upgradable smart phones no glue just clips and snaps and plugs swap screens, boards, and case frames with a few simple clicks and clacks
This is incredibly awesome, and I want one immediately.
Name of this Company?
4:17 preach, man.
Never seen anyone just casually nunchuck a laptop, until now....
TL;DNR: No. It's not "COMPLETELY" upgradeable.  According to their web site you can't, for example, upgrade the display, the GPU, or the touchpad.  There, saved you 20 minutes.
Great video
I love this and really hope it does well! The only thing that's holding me back from getting it (aside from the money) is I would like a 16" screen version. I do photo and video editing and a larger screen is really useful for that.
Shame for glossy screen. It d better with amd
Probably will buy one of these next time around if they add more options for models. Doesn't have to be paper thin just have upgrade paths.
This laptop would actually delay the destruction of the planet.
Why is he presenting this in the kitchen?
Performance model;  LARGER (THICKER) CASE BIGGER HEATSYNC FOR MB + Video card <----  Biggest hamper for most folks
THIS IS AMAZING
I like how you guys covered the order number on the webpage but not the url
I have no reason to buy one of these... but I think I'm going to buy one.
I can change a bezel...... I'm so clever!!!!!!
Project ara where are you? Hehe
Okay, but can it run DOOM? No for real, can it run DOOM Eternal at 4K HD at 60+ FPS?
My God. I hate todays shit. Learn a bit so you don't need QR codes.
almost sold but  ,no touch screen, no stylus , no dedicated graphics cards, no CPU upgradability are kind of all deal breakers and what is this thing made of anyways ?it is aluminum or magnesium alloy? can I even get a magnesium or titanium body option? hopefully they step it up on future models
i love it. if there were a 16" 17" version like the lg gram I'd take it
you can actually repair a macbook easier than an old thick lenovo you have no idea what youre talking about linus
if they make a full sd card module, ill sell my current laptop for this
This should be standard. Especially during the pap about ecology, where everything is the "consumer's fault" — not the producer — very convenient. I hope they don't screw it up and disappear. It reminds me a bit of the Ara project, which finally never came out. I keep my fingers crossed for them and hope that the laptop will also be available in Europe.
awesome. this should be normal
Right to repair, putting ones money where your mouth is!
Wow this makes me really want one. Unfortunately they aren't shipping in my region yet, also I don't tend to have the kind of money to afford laptops new :( but maybe I could afford a gen 1 laptop assuming they get discounted when they release gen 2. The modules look like they're USB type C is that right? I didn't see an option to buy empty modules that you could say mount a 40mm m.2 card in, or maybe just a breakout board to DIY your own components. Also I can't stand a touchpad that doesn't have Inertial movement / Momentum on it. I like to be able to flick the cursor across the screen, without it I can never find a decent compromise between responsiveness and accuracy. I don't know if the Windows precision drivers support it or not, I usually have to make sure it's a synaptics trackpad and even then it often takes trial and error with different drivers or even bodging on drivers for different brands. It'd be nice if there were multiple options for compatible pointing devices, I love the look of the one you reviewed recently (the Sensel Force Haptic Touchpad).  What would be really cool is if when they release a new model they also offer upgrade kits, so you get a new motherboard and a new CPU if the architecture is different, but can reuse your old case, battery, display, storage, memory, wifi etc. if none of those need upgrading. Maybe even offer a trade in program (as well as an upgrade program for those that don't want to DIY it) to help eliminate e-waste and recycle the old hardware into either discount machines for those on a budget or for developing markets. Or maybe for set-top boxes or other integrated devices or hobbyists or even just as a stock pile of spare parts so that users can still find replacements years later.  Maybe they could also offer different options based on how many people want it, like an Indiegogo campaign, if enough people want an AMD Zen 3 version for instance then they could make a compatible motherboard knowing that the preorders would at least cover the development costs. How about a gamer option with a larger case and display (and maybe keyboard) that has enough room inside to fit the standard motherboard, plus a 90Wh battery and a dedicated graphics card, the card would probably take up the IO from 1 or even 2 modules, but you could use that space to install a second exhaust fan.
upgradable*
Ordered. I can't wait to see where this goes.
It's modular? Heck, the military is gonna be all over this.
When you said 4 mil between sensors, did you mean 4 thousands of an inch? As when you said it, I heard 4 mm as mil and mm is often interchangeably used in UK, then it occurred to me that in American woodworking videos that's how that use the term (thousands of an inch).
This is Like a dream come true.
The fact that it's remarkable that this thing is repairable and upgradable with the encouragement of the manufacturer is exactly why I have precicely zero interest in owning a laptop.  There's no excuse for treating a device like that as a single disposable unit.  It's just plain wasteful.  At least one manufacturer is getting it right.
yes, this is the kind of stuff we need, and want to see more of.
i REALLY want one but im a teen with no job so i want one for christmas
Go have a downer before breaking this computer.
Yo why dell be so thicc tho
They will be gone in 12 months ... sadly. Actually got hyped.
Are you going to do a rain test like you did with the XPS?
Your unabashed enthusiasm was infectious.  👍🏾👍🏻👍
Fuck that apple stuff
Soooooock DK
They make this so user-friendly that I think I would have trouble working on it
This video contradicts itself, and so does the laptop.
Would be nice to see nvidia and amd make mobile gpus upgradeable. But demand is no there. If only this guys could come up with a solution
i really want to buy one now but im broke :)
Like just to ****** dell
Would be amazing if this is the future of laptops and personal pc's
They should make a module with two usb a/c even if less bandwidth, sometimes you need more ports
Think I've found my next laptop
Why can’t they just create a laptop that doesn’t break/ need repair 😂
I just love it!!!
I love it. I will definitely look here next time i need a laptop
Links die. Day 1, scan EVERY code, and save those pages as .PDF files. While yor're at it, download all newest drivers and BIOS updates.
YO LINUS .... please do a Video On What to do When buying Used Gaming PCs / hardware ...like how to Test if everything is working right etc etc....the Used market is Huge and it would help a lot if you can Give us An insight as to What to test etc...like run crystaldiskmark to make sure of Drive speeds ...do Dead pixel Test... Temprature test... Cpu clock speed ...Gpu clock speed .....   for example im going to Buy a  Used gaming pc From Someone , and have a Set of Test to Do to make Sure the System is 100% without Faults .... THANX in advance😁 ... Been A huge fan For over 12😁 years
I would be really interested if they could allow us to use a kind of uppgradeable modular gpu
Sorry to say it, but it will never be a hit. It has no Apple logo ...
I really thought there was not going to be drops in this video
This should be the ONLY legal laptop to sell now that right to repair has passed.  Make Apple et al unable to sell their products that cheat the consumer. PS: Now get Anthony to put Linux on it.
Just bought an Asus laptop 2 weeks ago and now that makes me sad 😂. Hopefully this company lasts so I get my next laptop from them
Sold
Presumably u have to go through them for all upgrades?
This is wat a laptop has to be, if manufactures what to have integrate designs on consumer laptops but enterprise laptops shouldn't have to, fortunately most of these things Lenovo do with the ThinkPad line like the battery, keyboard, and screen without glue but with screws, but it's a rare thing, apple is apple, they release the butterfly switches to save 0,5mm of thickness.
This laptop is Louis Rossmann's wet dreams
I've always hated that my laptop wasn't upgradeable, i've now been using my desktop for over 3 years exclusively since the laptop broke down. I'd love to have a reliable laptop like this one, i hope this doesn't flop
What Graphics card is in these things though? Just wondering because that's the ONE thing that is NOT listed on their website.
In terms of repairing "stock" laptops HP Probook 430/450 G7/G8 are pretty good as well, but getting the parts is still a slow/hard process, but you can get them. if someone thrashed the left hinge you can actually order a left hinge.
1.2k mac users dislike this video
MOOOOOOM he called my hands idiots....LOL
EVERY SINGLE computer manufacturer from Dell to ESPECIALLY APPLE, NEEDS to follow Framework's example. JUST because of the way Framework has done this laptop, my next laptop WILL BE ONE FROM FRAMEWORK!!!
Lmfao by the looks of your phone it's safe to say you pretty much drop everything.
if they're still around in a couple years when i come to replace my xps, im buying one. though tbf to dell, the repair work ive done on my xps (repaste, fan replacement, new battery) has been a decent experience, except for getting hold of parts
We need more companies like this(Framework), System76 and Purism. Give the option for making the ME or PSP inoperable, freethe bios with coreboot , and if they come through with ARM and RISC cpu options too, I'll be so pumped and would purchase one. I bought a new laptop months ago and returned it the next day cause the whole thing just stunk of B.S. can't remove the battery , have to make a online account just to get to the desktop screen etc etc🤢 Instead I purchased a couple old thinkpads and am so much more excited, I can upgrade alot of it(screen, battery, BOTH ram modules, socketed CPUs, and certain wifi cards) also I can remove the WWAN card if I want aaand there's ways to add additional SSD storage in the cd/dvdrom with a harness, and where the wwan is. To me that's way cooler than the proprietary b.s. however being able to have those things with a latest release cpu would be awesome.  P.S. make sure to support "right to repair"
Linus hasn't been this excited since he discovered sex for the first time... :D :D :D
When is this company making car
I got my first PC today!
1.2K  Crapple repair employees disliked this.
I hope they make a gaming laptop
How has this man go from a normal respectable man you a homeless guy you forgot has been in the couch for the last 3 months
How do i get 1 in uk ?
you seem to have missed one key detail. how much more does this thing cost compared to a similarly specced "conventional" laptop?  a quick bit of research confirms what i suspected. that these things cost more than double. so how do i justify upgradeability when i can just buy a brand new laptop at the end of it's lifespan with the spare money i have left over after not buying one of these? if i upgraded everything on this laptop - effectively replacing the laptop - presumably it would cost more than just buying a new conventional laptop.
11:35 -- Did you say, "Dell" or "Adele"?  Joking aside, this laptop has the potential to be a game changer.
So i basically came watching this
11:54
What would you upgrade in your existing laptop that you really wish you could but can't? HDD to SSD? Yes you can. More Ram? Sure. Better wifi? Probably but is that typically an issue? Gigabit Ethernet? Ok, cheap dongle. Video outs are usually good enough as supplied.
IS CPU UPGRADABLE?
imagine everything was like frameworks laptop
I am really annoyed by his body language and over confident 😒
There is a modular phone, called fair phone
If every lap was like that 😅 some models opening takes long🥴
If it was as upgradeable as a desktop, OK. But it's not even close. It's almost the same as a typical laptop and not worth the money to modify components.
The market actually doesn't want this.
This is when you DON'T buy cheap Chinese replicas as replacement parts and make these guys go bankrupt! Please support them, people!!
I'm really impressed even with the webcam
✨
Thank God, I hope this catches on
It's like a dream! So good to be true!
I'm gonna love this laptop
But does it come with all those attachments? Or is that gonna cost me an arm and a leg? 😅
"If they do a partnership with an anime show that I like for a keyboard skin or something..." Do you know something we don't, Linus?
all it needs is a thinkpad keyboard
"Omgesus this is so cool"   **never uses it again**
Im buying 2 before... The big teck shuts them down for no reason... I'm looking at you Apple..
I sent this video and the site to my boss. I work for a chain of Computer repair shops and this would be an amazing device for us to get contracted to be a dealer for. I already like it over the ideapads we sell and would be a awesome device to put next to an intel NUC
Thank you for video, I wish all manufacturer would do this, it would make life easier for these people who like building their own computer and for these on lower income!
2:14 it's just a bunch of USB type C ports, nothing spectacular. Edit, it is NICE, but I miss CPU and GPU upgradability. There are mobile components... we all know this. Edit #2, yeah, I'm gonna get one like this... build it yourself version.
See how they used the Brown Cardboard box, cuz thats environment friendly and gosh I already love this laptop
I freaking love this... and after looking the cost isn't too bad. I just hope they don't disappear or sell out to one of these proprietary asshats.
Amazing.
so its not completely upgradeable.....
Apple is a fashion company first and foremost.
i have no need or really even desire for a laptop, but i want to buy one just to support them. i love this sort of thing (which the customizable phone had become a thing). really hope this compnay can succeed enough to make CPU, GPU or screen customizable too!
this is fantastic - also the background story is really cool, all engineers from ex massive companys who see how much better the product can be just come together and make their own - beautiful
Watching this video while I am updating windows 11 in the beta channel!
My ancient laptop with an Intel Core 2 Duo T5750 and 3 GB RAM is still running great. Works awesome for Linux distro-testing actually. Running Fedora 34 at the moment. I keep saying, "I'm gonna replace it when it dies"...but it never dies...it never dies...
meanwhile linus who stealthly put 2 sponsers in 1 video.
so the question is what do they do when a customer screws up. i don't want to be paying for others mistakes, there should be no warranty as such. unless you can reasonably prove manufacture defect.   you buy it, you own it, right?
I love this idea for both the consumer and commercial markets. It would be so nice to easily fix laptops in-house as they fail or employees break them. External graphics options would be nice too.
I want one!
BITD I was on the Sony Vaio development team (committee). My background is as an integration engineer. Ergonomics and simplicity being my guiding principles. Most of the suggestions I made were ignored completely. Mainly upgradability and future proofing. I was flat out told that would limit the number of units that could be produced. RIP Sony. This concept by Framework is essentially the same common sense approach that we envisioned in 1996. Unfortunately the final product was barely different from the same crap everyone else was selling at the time. The Thinkpad was a compromise. The Latitude and Inspiron products from Dell were decent but still short feature life junk.
No GPU no thanks!
¡I love it! ♥️
I find it amusing that he can include a ad for a case that can take a high end graphics card when you can even buy one because of the shortage of gpu. Lol
I wish that they had a larger laptop. I'm hoping that will happen within the next year or two.
If I acc had enough to get a high end laptop I would deffinetly get this
When Electric cars where made like this, to customisable and understand your car, it would be a massiv push in this direction
am i the only one who doesn't care about modularity in a laptop?
Everyone buy one.
why a wired mouse? Because i came up with this idea in twenty fucken eleven.
I'm not gonna trust that a company is "for the user" until they drop the .99 in their pricing. Nobody wants the pain of calculating pennies.  This is a good first step though. 👍
But is the GPU upgradeable? LOL
Ok those QR codes on each internal component really impressed me.
It don't look elegant to me though haha
I was due for an upgrade, I guess I know what I will buy next.
I always wanted this for both phones and laptops and finally we get it for laptops.
I just bought a new laptop the week before this video because my old one off-ed itself and I'm livid, this looks so much better, even with Linux
Everyone is talking about SteamDeck, but hey.....if that thing would succeed, it would become the real revolution in portable/semi-handheld gaming.
FrameWork isn’t take pre-orders outside of US and Canada 😔
I hope this become mainstream.
Awesome product 👍
Someone send a link to Louis Rossman
FINALLY. A LAPTOP WITH A *GOOD F§?CKING CAMERA!!!*
This also happened to with Nokia or whatever the manufacturer's name that wanted to bring plug-and-play smartphone modules.
Does anyone else prefer the thicker laptop designs?
Amazing only issue with this is why are they stuck with intel where is the customizability i need AMD CPU and RTX GPU
"Huge touchoad, screws" (points at the keyboard). 🙄
Can u game on it tho
Can you game on this thing?
Put a Linux on it! No more problems with windows paired with the motherboard. Then you will have a real modular computer
Activate Windows!
But I like some chonk in my laptops
This is genuinely beautiful.
I'm in the market for a laptop and was waiting for the macbook 14 inch to come out. I pre ordered one of these last night instead! I believe that this product is going to go places! And even if doesn't go places...at least I can still upgrade the ram and ssd for potential longer use (depending on how I take care of it)
Can they do this to phones next?
Linus is an complete sell out, this laptop is hot garbage. Just look up the reviews on this laptop.
The elastic red postnatally encourage because swedish lilly spark amidst a supreme trouble. colossal, material atom
They got a strong framework 😂😂😂
USB C is GODLY
Did my dream just come true...Hell Yes
Similar to google’s  hardware upgradable  smart phone project they shutdown years ago.
Only think missing IMO is making it a touch screen / tablet convertible. Guess you can't have it all...
The most believable positive review of a product that I’ve seen in a while lol. I might be right there with you at “sold” 😂
I'm turned on by this and the possibilities.
No dedicated GPU?
Make me one when replaceable CPU and GPU and I may be interested
When Project Ara was cancelled, I already stopped on believing that Modular portable devices can still be made. But now, I wanna pre-order one of this. This is gold, the future of portable devices/laptops!
I need to see a 17" 'content creator' or 'gaming' version of this as soon as humanly possible. We need it for the culture. I've literally wanted something like that for most of my natural life.  Intel/AMD CPU with octa-core + HyperThreading All the current memory/storage configs AMD/nVidia RTX GPUs 1440p 165Hz screen  With this level of customizability and general aesthetic? I would pay the premium for that and never look at other brands again. I don't know if it's possible but I want to dream again.  I don't normally comment on this stuff but I just wanted to maybe show that there's excitement/interest out here for something like this when I can.
I wish you released this video a few weeks earlier, when I haven't finally bought my first laptop yet.
I wondered when you'd cover this new hardware!  It sounds so cool!
Linus can i ask if you mind adjusting some sfx on your videos ? A loud pure tone beep at 11:54 is quite discomfort for my ear which has a sound sensitive disorder ( i have hearing damage) , thank you and really appreciate if you can do it.
Wow
Someone : - What if we introduce OOPs to hardware?  Framework: -   Hold my beer :)
So this is the first laptop who's target audience is mainly repair shops?
ANother thing to like about it is the packaging: as little plastic as possible and most of the addon stuff is packaged in carboard which is recyclable.
Very cool, think it can run some games?
Wow I'm definitely gonna buy this for collage or school
HOLY SHIT WHEN I START MAKING MONEY THEY WILL GET ORDERS FROM ME
This is my next laptop
I have never wanted a laptop more. Ive been looking at getting a laptop but knowing it will be obsolete in a few years is a no for me
can I upgrade the gpu?
So can I upgrade from x86 to arm in the future?
The only drawback I see, no potential for graphics expansion
2021 - Swapable io 2030 - swapable gpu Now that's cool
That is the best camera I've ever seen on a laptop
It is also Linux and BSD compatible ? When it is only for Windows than it is sadly for the trash.
yes to Framework
The only problem I can see is the low amount of ports, but I don't think anyone would actually use more than 4 ports at once on a laptop, and anyway surely you could build a single module with multiple ports.  USB hubs exist, so fitting, for example, two USB A ports in one module should be possible, I would think.
As someone about to buy a gaming laptop for my half year abroad, I'd really like to see what framework could do in terms of dedicated graphics. The screen upgrade would be pretty straightforward, but fitting a mobile graphics card might be difficult in a design like this
This is actually extremely cool. I won't be needing a laptop in the near future, but if I ever will, I'd be really interested in a framework one.
Is that Alex from mystery tech
This is bloody awesome
This company is more customer oriented than any other laptop manufacturer and the product is both of high quality and affordable. I so hope they get successful. Unfortunately I don't need a laptop right now.
Dang, that's pretty cool! If I end up needing a laptop soon, while I will of course do further research, this is for sure in the running and at the top of the list right now.
The clear key caps is the greatest thing since the ant farm keyboard...
hard to convince the IT departments though, which are the biggest sponsors of non-repairable devices.
Got an Asus laptop some time back.  Decided on the lower-ram option to save a buck, opting to upgrade it later when I had the money.  hahaha...  No door on the bottom to access it.  Had to completely flay it to pieces, removing the motherboard and unplugging several fragile ribbon cables, dozens of screws etc just to get to the ram slots on the bottom of the motherboard.  I get the impression that the hassle was...intentional.  Framework is the company I have been looking for.  Now they just need to start making smartphones.  Either way, I'm a customer.
If people buy these on mass other companies may follow suit.  That would be awesome!
when they make a full size gaming unit.....ill definitely buy
This thing reviewed by Dave Lee, I'm waiting for the "Talk"
tears in my eyes. Actual tears. This philosophy of techdev is so lovely. When I saw those spare screws inside, incase you misplace one while repairing it yourself.... omfg my heart just dropped
No cap, I think that if this isn't a direct replacement to all laptops, I don't know what this is
Bro.  I am getting this (I say before hearing the actual price).  If nothing else, I want to reward this, even if I didn't need it.
MacBooks are quite easy to repair,…..
Fuuuuuck yes! OMFG I llove it <3
me encanta
I respect what they're trying to do. Though I won't jump on the ship until processors and graphics cards become upgradeable, if that's every a possibility.
I love this, I hope this is the way all hardware is approached in the future.  Will this support EGPUs without an issue?
Zi Linus complained about proprietary connectors but this laptop most likely is proprietary stuff
WANT. IT.
Wheres Anthony ? we need new vid about budget pc's
Wow. This laptop is so boss. Please add more content like this!!!
I was hoping for upgradable graphics card
I absolutely love this idea and I'm shopping for a new laptop! but I kinda need a dedicated GPU. I really hope these guys stick around so I can pick one up down the line. This is really the direction the industry needs to go.
i love how you completely sail around the fact that you could have 3 peripherals at max :D sorry but a notebook without ethernet? no thanks. needs at least 3 additional usb3 ports and so on...nice idea tho
Ok that laptop is beautiful and I haven't wanted to buy a new one in years but I WILL OWN THAT LAPTOP. SOON.
I wished this was around 2 years ago before I paid . 1K for my Razer blade '13 :( .  they should sell gear or something for those people who want to support them but do not need a computer... currently.
Linus is really such a nerd... that is why I love him lol... I'm a nerd too... I love this stuff....
Linux and risc-v shout outs. Hell yeah.
I look forward to the day when laptop motherboards, keyboards, and displays, use industry standard form factors.
They already make a usb-c magnetic adapter for charging
Technology is simple only if we don't over complicate it.
Iam now regretting buying a new laptop without checking this out first
Why only Intel tho? Seems like a poor choice to me.
having recently repaired a 17" alienware laptop, this looks great
doo-dad-a-majigs haha
Coolest thing I have seen in awhile!
But why do you wear earrings?  So weird.
In before we never hear about this again.
not saying vid was bad, but the only reason I liked is when linus drp[[ed the hdmi😂
I own a computer repair business and will be recommending these to customers! will make my life easier. Even if its easy DIY most wont, and will still bring it to me.
Was going to order one but they don't ship to Australia yet unfortunately, but man this is a game changer for me when they do.
Linus just fangirling for 18 min and 46 sec 😂😂
Freaking nice - finally a company that goes the excact oposite direction of apple ! thumbs up
I wish they succeed and they get a killer gaming laptop with upgradable GPU in the future!
but monke
The biggest problem with this is I already have a newish laptop, if it unexpectedly dies I’m buying one of these
This is what happens when engineers take control of a company. BAs are only interested in saving that fraction of a cent you said from the three extra screws, multiply it by millions upon millions of devices and then imagine that money coming into their salary. That's what the golden boys dream about every day.
**lists older HP Spectre on facebook marketplace** I NEED THIS
LETS SEE THIS SUCCEED IM SO EXCITED!!!
i would love to add hi-res audio on  that port..awesomee
Oh no, they don't ship to Europe yet
Check out the pinephone. A Smartphone with similar ability to upgrade and repair parts
OK IT UPGRADES, BUT WILL IT BLEND? THAT IS THE QUESTION.
Just Plunk it in.
What really PISSES me OFF is that of the CPU ... The manufacturers of Laptops have really dropped the ball ... I feel that they are LAZY as HELL when it comes to making Laptop CPU's upgradable ... I have an ASUS Laptop and I didn't know that the CPU wasn't upgradable ... Again! I'm really PISSED OFF about that .... UGH!
I will Not even Care about that Being a whole cm of thincknes if the cpu And even the Socket were replacable
I have a magnetic charger for my iPhone and Samsung
No matter how exciting techology this guy shows I honestly just cannot keep my mind away from a thought  "shit he is going to drop this".
16:54 That was perfect lol
An awesome way for the future, any hardware possible should be built like this. High end products will still live but this idea could seriously minimize replacement of a lot of hardware. Like in the past when stuff was easily repaired and lasted a long time. This computer is right in time when development is fast but tries to live as long as possible for the user. Really awesome effort both to the manufacturer and Linus to show this and spread it. Very, no I mean, cool if it happens all around the world.
Very interesting, no GPU or AMD options though it seems.
9:52 Well Linus, i guess that's because you are always talking about Apple in particular when you talk about that topic. And it's true, people should be allowed to repair their stuff. If they fuck up then that's their own fault! I guess this could be fixed with a clausule in the fine print where it state as much. Of course, how is someone going to proof that it is by their own doing. I guess it would cost company's just too much trouble if people try to repair their shit themselves and mess up and then don't say it to the company. If it then falls under warranty they need to find the original problem and what the user has been doing to it. So in that regard, i can understand. But i think someone like yourself for example should absolutely have the right to repair.  Now, to call this thing beautiful, for me, i don't really like it, but i think these modular pieces are so great! And yeah, that razor concept pc, that thing was a beauty! Well thought out! Though i think today's version would even be better of course.
They should offer a replaceable external case, for wear and tear, and Im definetely getting their v2 when I am employed
hmmm, in 2 of the latest videos (at least the ones i have seen) there are parts where they did things like 11:55      i love this whoever you hired/whatever you did tell them i love them :D
I'm just mad that this didn't come out when I was in the market for a university laptop. It checks all the boxes I had defined back then and more. Now my current laptop will probably last for a couple of years more, meaning I won't get to help this great company get a foothold
Gaming stress result?
*proceeds to lose extra screws*
Why wouldn't you use a wired mouse?
No AMD, No deal.
This looks actually like a fun laptop to tinker around.
The next version should be compatible with Lenovo/IBM 7-row keyboard. Or someone should make a new modern motherboard for X230/T430.  Hopefully in (near) future Framework will introduce Amd motherboard and Risc-V when it's ready for daily (Linux) use.
look i know society is quite a mess rn, but at least let this be adopted, please have this evolve into the new industry standard.  i remember this to be a thing with old, square screen laptops and idk why humanity stepped away from it rather than to innovate it, like just shove in extra storage or an extra display port or whatever
09:14 No, it's not a "Mini PCIe" slot. Because Mini PCIe is effectively discontinued in 2015. It's called NGFF WiFi slot.
I love this, despite no *internal* accelerated graphics card.
Oh Louis must be happy about this :)
Integrate a 4k touch screen and this very well may be my next laptop.
Anyone know what sort of battery life this would get in either gaming or general tasks?
The order page let's you choose what you want too can't wait to start seeing more from framework
I would gladly buy this, waiting for EU availability.
They should make a 17 inch version as well with numpad.
I would love to see a later iteration with upgradeable graphics card. Dell and Clevo have gone down that route before.
YES.. yes.. YES
I hope it is successful
11:54 LMAO WHAT WAS THAT I’M CRYING
0:42 Jesus kill??? ☠️✝️
💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
Not even on a phone. Give no room for excuses. Right to repair should be universal.
This makes me want to buy my own laptop.
Gorgeous is a bit of stretch but it's not ugly. It is great though!
Magnet USB C already exist I believe, but the power might only be for phone at the moment
Basically a Google ara but laptop which means it comes with all the reasons and weaknesses to not work, most notably third parties wouldnt really make modules for it which means you'd have to buy everything off the company which also inturn means they can price however but wait since they're a niche sub category in the laptop industry they wouldn't really sell that many laptops which inturn means they'd have to make up the money from the modules ._. If I cant have Google ara yall cant have laptops
No doubt, I would invest in Framework... soon
I have a laptop with only 2GB of RAM.  When I look into the software, it says 1 of 2 RAM modules fitted. When I opened it I found out there weren't any slots for RAM. Only 1 of 2 RAM ICs was soldered on. That means to expand it I would have had to find the right RAM-IC and solder the ball-grid-array ;-( It was only possible to exchange the 2.5 HDD hard drive for an SSD and install Linux.
Is running my laptop plugged in the wall all the time actually ruins the battery ?? @16:41
What about graphics card? It what most laptop users want to be upgradable. Would be cool if they had modules to change cpu and gpu.
I still want a modular headphone jack tho.
I think there website is crashing.
Kinda reminds me of older Thinkpad
Which USB 3.2? I need the reference chart
Linus you've been really missing the point of apple. Apple is a company and its first goal is not fulfilling consumers wishes unstead making profit is their top priority. There's no reason to blame them or shame them just because you don't like their products.
It’s really mind blowing how a company that has less than a 100 employees can make something this user friendly and cool and just makes you want to buy one rn. Meanwhile apple and other companies who just wanna take as much money as they want, get rid of little things that won’t cost them a dollar just so the customers will buy new Produkt in case the old one has one little problem. I really want this company to succeed and I hope more people talks about that so more and more people knows about. Just don’t want dell or any shit company to try and stop them.
Can it run Linux tho?
buyed 12 laptops right away
Make one video on Full upgrade Dell precision m6800 🥺
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS THIS WE HAVE TO SUPPORT THIS
I am really hoping this is successful. I’m not expecting other companies like Apple to sell anything like this. Part of apples sales is their Apple Care. I’ve had Apple care on all my products (iPhone, ipad, Apple Watch, and AirPods Pro) but I’ve never had to use Apple care. If I could repair the devices myself I wouldn’t buy it period. Places like best buy wouldn’t need things like geek squad if the majority of their customers could fix their own problems. I don’t expect to see this in person except maybe at a micro center.
How well does it support Linux?
I came here for techs, not feels. But his really touched my hacker soul. Thank you for this clip. I now know what my next laptop will be.
Looks amazing
Everyone remember phonebloks? Motorola would have done so much if they hadn't been bought by Google and dissected for parts and patents
Ok let's talk about the price?
What is the price comparison with a non-modular similarly specc'd lappy?
ooohhhhhhhh just wanted to order one for the EU they only have US keyboards .... sadge
now open up a way for consumers to sell their used parts back to them to upgrade, fix then sell 2nd hand :D
I wish some large company would partner with them and order butts load of their amazing product. We need more of these.
This just shows that the past should be the future! I remember when laptops were a bit more upgradable then just sticking in a new hard drive or a new stick of RAM, if they even give you that nowadays. The big hardware manufacturers could learn from Framework and their philosophy in end user convenience, but I'm not going to hold my breath. I don't need a new laptop, my HP Omen is 10 months old, but if i did I would seriously consider pre-ordering from these guys!
2:21 I really thought Linus was gonna spin that laptop over his fingers
And what about the graphics chip (card) and sound chip (card)? One of the reasons to buy a normal desktop pc, because of upgradability. Is this laptop any good for video editing?
ever heard of ThinkPad laptops?
wow they call this upgrade able but the MF doesn't have a combo burner
The way you got excited at the screwdriver made me realise that we could be kindred spirits
I only thing i want to be able to upgrade on my laptop is the graphics card or processor.. The rest more or less dont affect me much
Why another dude in the room wearing a mаsk? Is he l000ney?
i want to buy one of these.
1:58 Do u still use that note 9?
A dream comes true.
THATS a product with the end-user in mind, not just the profit. already love it
Well if they put display port/hdmi interface on the motherboard, but modified the port using smaller custom connectors. Then they build a small universal screen controller board that connect with that custom connectors. which end user can flash multiple firmware depending on what screen module they use. Combine with a motherboard that can use a custom casing. I called it GG then.
I'm sold on this. Signed up to be notified when it's out in the UK 👍
Very interesting. Waiting for the day we can swap NVMe SSDs from a slot at the side of the laptop.
Battery disconnect is also for when you want to remove the internal battery. lenovo and other laptops have it as well.
WIshed I waited a little longer before purchasing my current laptop. Framework, this is awesome stuff. I'll be sure to get one when (touchwood) my laptop dies on me in 5 years, so please continue to be awesome!
I hope they succeed, but the graphics is too weak. Ditch that intel xe and put something decent in there instead
This is what engineering should be. Its a love letter to the consumers of the world
i remember seeing some microsoft exec on youtube gushing over a Surface laptop because it didn't have any visible screws anywhere. I guess they suck it together with the outcome of said gushing.
I wanna buy too... sign me in ✅
If you need a laptop now, forget about it.
I am so sold, I was thinking about getting a second laptop to run Linux for development exclusively and this is perfection.
As someone who already has a high powered desktop as their main device this is very tempting. Just wonder how USD converts to GBP. If it's with the current exchange rate then this is a big yes. If it's the same like other companies do then it's meh.   I also hope over time they will add new modules as well because there's a few others I'd like to see
Remember the panasonic moduler laptop
And Yet someone still dares to say "Apple is tech leading and always wins"
thanks cheese kill
....I might just consider getting this laptop instead of a gaming desktop now
I WANT IT!!!
They haven't started shipping to India yet but I am sure if they will then it will be a huge success. Why? Because Indians prefer cost effective products and also there is no shortage of Geeks here.  Edit: Ofcourse they should get better response after they've figured out a way to add Graphics Card.
This is revolutionary! I will share until my heart’s content. To bad the base model is sold out right now!
if it's reasonably priced, it'd be my next laptop
14:41 yoink!
What was that little black thing inserted into the side of the laptop
in principle, could two usb-A ports fit in a single one of these square plugins?
I love this! I want this as my next laptop... plus I love to build things. Not to save money, but saving money just makes the adventure that much more fun
i was like ok ok i really want this so i went to there site and i saw $1k and now im sad lmao
FANTASTIC CUSTOM LAPTOP CONCEPT. I had to pause this, Nearly fell off chair in laughter when he 'coughed up' an DELL came out.
The major company might be consider framework as a threat
Too bad that they didn't included mxm module support
But, is the graphics card upgradable?
Tell me again, since i want confirmation, is the processor interchangeable? Also does this have graphics card? Because RAM and storage (HDD/SSD) are interchangeable in like every gaming laptop so what's the difference? 🤷🏻‍♂️ Yes of course every thing is modular even the speaker can be changed but mostly people have to get rid of their laptops because of low performance. Not because of speaker or battery that's a huge minority.
oh that's good
It was always planned obsolescence.
just Bravo. This is what we call customer focused products.
now that looks like  "Real Linus Phone"🤣🤣
too bad no Ryzen
Louis Rossmann approves this message
NOOOOOO! They left the audio jack non-modular! Seriously, this is one of the interfaces I'm waiting to get rid of for years, since I'm only using USB-headsets (if any) - but it just won't disappear, neither on laptops not PC cases. :-(  But it's a very cool device! Hopefully they'll soon - start operating in Germany - sell a 'gaming model' - and I don't mean LED stuff (someone may do this as USB-C-module, I don't care) but a dedicated upgradeable GPU - sell an AMD-powered model  Let me dream my dreams! ;-)
does it take a sim card?
It's not because they dont trust you. It's because they want you to buy a new laptop everytime a small component fails.
Now I am torn… I was 100% convinced I would be getting myself a 2020 MacBook Air as my first laptop, but this thing is amazing….
The omniscient harp genomically hope because faucet diagnostically snatch towards a whole sailor. snotty, brash degree
Hello
wow thats first , Linus techtips approved. lets go this should be good
Replaceable IOs are useless, today all you need is a bunch of usb 3.2s, get rid of anything that uses any interface being not usb.
I want to buy this so bad but it isn't available in my region. Instantly sold.
So  wholesome. Faith in humanity restored.
Ingenious product! I hope they put the other companies out of business, or at the very least this should make them sweat.
I can see the "power on at ac connect" useful for those desktop cases that someone will create. Exsample once you upgrade your mobo+cpu in the laptop, the old one could became your second desktop pc or small home server
I also believe it's simply not possible to do a thumbnail without you throwing a soy face in it
This thing is genious and needs success to blow up and actually become a thing. Would be great for EVERY consumer. Even i would love to have upgradeable laptops and i hate those things.
Step 1: come up with new standards for tiny laptop components that can be moved (SODIMM is about 30x too big)   Step 2: doesnt exist, nobody will do step 1.
I want this SOOOOOOOO badly. But I can't have it yet because preorders aren't open in my geographical area... ☹ but I have already signed up for their notification system, monthly updates and weekly newsletter and I did that less than two minutes into this video. That shows you how much I want this to work and succeed.
This concept if not only a nice idea its neccesary for our future.
honestly, if I hadn't just bought a new laptop I'd be throwing down for a pre order. I really hope these guys stay around, love the ideology
"noooooooooo! we can't build a customizable laptop, the case might flex a little when you twist it!"  Why do we accept this from tech makers? Future proofing + an upgrade path matter 5000x more to me than subjective or pointless crap like thinness or whatever else. Like damn, I'll have to throw this expensive computing device away in 4-5 years, but at least I can fit it in an envelope in the meantime! 🤪
I'll definitely take note of this. Waiting for AMD counterpart, something that can do light/less graphically intense gaming too.
16:24 which is not a selling point. battery idle in wall mode is more common than you apparently know.
I plan to buy one as soon as is available in the country I am living now. We cheer as much as we want but if we don't actually buy it, it does not matter.
lel. my thinkpad is much more upgradeable. with a real screen, better keyboard,; just no the GPU but the Quadro 500ish is already peak for laptop.
Please don't fail. This looks so good.
10:20 I tell you something: The fact that you get only ONE USB SLOT PER MODULE is kind of stupid. Not every usb connected device is going to saturate the entire link, and the form factor is (at least almost) big enough to support two slots beside one another. Does it come with an ethernet port? Unlikely because that design isn't thick enough to support it. No ethernet port on my laptops is a massive no-go. So in the end, you are only limited to 4 things as per this design. Which is still a problem due to the size of it. If they really cared, you would have a DEDICATED NVME slot, that is for nothing but NVME for a much better upgradeable storage experience.  The big question is the cost of the upgrade modules, and the next big question is THEIR choice of which things are going in there. So we have to rely on their choice selection plus the cost of the modular part. We still talk proprietary form factor here. It is NOT "put in directly what you want". It is NOT "here is a tray to put your aftermarket piece of equipment in" like YOUR choice of SSD. So yeah, golfclap. They shouldn't get bonus points for doing something that has been the standard in the past.  This looks like a concept that is going the "in spite, for the people!" route. But how many of them will actually be sold remains the question. Yes, they're using the buzzword "modular" better than most others do. Yes they are nice to provide detailed information and easy accessibility with QR codes. But that is all there is to it. The real modularity that the consumers would actually appreciate is still not there, because this laptop, like anything else, remains a business decision.
Well i dont know about anyone else but, i love how Framework made this laptop very modular when it comes to connections like a full sized displayport port or HDMI port ect. i have never seen other companies do this.
Only 5 screws to remove the bottom? My old Clevo laptop, no screws needed, just slide the lock button and push it back for full access to cooler, motherboard, ram and whatever :)  EDIT: Hope in the future they make something bigger and actually customizable like Clevo did where we can choose the CPU, GPU, screen... For now not even having an actual GPU other than iGPU I would never buy such thing, not that I would actually buy a laptop nowadays, I'd rather stick with Desktop + smartphone and maybe something like the upcoming Steamdeck to play something on-the-go as I don't play android crapware...
Okay, give me an ethernet port (i use that for work) and a GPU (or at least a high end APU from AMD) and I'm sold!
GPU?
I'm gonna invest in that company...period.
make it available in EUROPE!
1:55 that phone has been a victim of Linus drop tips.
Do people actually use trac pads by choice?
It's a shame that there was never a universal form factor for notebook computers going back 20 years.
Do they specify the standard screw length/thread they use? I know this sounds odd, but it'd be *really* cool if I could use my own, custom, security screws.  Imagine reduced support, faster turnarounds, from a highly serviceable laptop like this in corp environment. - but you can still (as much as security screws do anyway) prevent concerns of non-IT users messing around with stuff inside.
Was that episode sponsored by Framework ?
I wanna move to America just to buy Framework. We want Europe shipping!
Just Wow!!! Finally :) Great job Framework!
If i had not just purchased a 2500$ laptop i would have gotten it. I really love the fact that they tackled most of the things one hates about traditional roadblocks manufacturer’s put to keep you on a rep purchase time line. Like the battery disconnect option in bios.
What's the brand of this laptop? And where can I purchase it? Does it have a website?
They should add dummy expansion card (for cheap) to just hide the holes on the sides if someone dont want to buy all 4. On the order site they clearly recommend to buy four so I think if someone want less will have a laptop with empty slots.
DDR5 on the way and this won't get it. Kinda pointless unless you fix that
Brilliant. I want one. Please make it available in Australia
*This laptop is literally everything i ever wanted from a laptop.*
I hope this idea catches up! It would be so amazing!
this is a really good concept.   Hope more manufacturer adopt this.
8:15 I would have a mini heart attack dealing with things that I just bought
This is the first time in my Internet history, I gonna probably order a product due to a YouTube video! Good job in the video, awesome job by framework! Refreshing and innovative....I can't believe I actual said that, for a device that's upgradable.... that's so 90's
Can we acknowledge that if this caught on, this philosophy can and should influence bigger companies into doing the same?
linus takes out phone --- all cracked up from being dropped....
I have 2 laptop which has very little problem that is easily repairable, but guess what, i need to buy a whole new motherboard for it
Apple spend billion on R&D to make their customer spend more :D
1:37 Linus is used to it
If I ever need a laptop again I’m definitely gonna get one of these bad boys
as a IT support engineer, please delete this HAHAHAHA
These IO-modules could allow very easy docking station designs, just add USB-C connector pins at the bottom!
Why did I have to buy and go spectre360 this is so much cooler and so nerdy
It took us long enough to get * mostly * upgradable laptops. Now we need CPUs and GPUs that we can swap out on laptops.
im 3 mins into the video, definitely my next laptop.
You still use a wired mouse because you enjoy the true plug and play experience and can't be bothered with charging yet another device.
The fact that microcenter sponsors me is still too much
I put in my request for notice when they are selling in Australia. Love the concept, and I needed a laptop. I can wait a while.
I love this concept...
Imagine a gaming laptop by these guys
I was referred to this because I said I was looking for a good, ethical laptop and honestly it sounds interesting but the price is a MASSIVE turnoff. I know a lot of people have thousands to throw at these things but goddamn, 800 bucks to START and that's BEFORE any options just guts me and my savings.
I fell into the trap of buying GPU upgradeable laptops and the manufacturer never provided upgrades in either case.  They want you to replace, not upgrade.  This company looks different, I hope they succeed.
This would be a cool gift for a kid who wants ro engineer simething, and qlso ud be happier cuz u built it urself
If that was apple it would be yours for $6000 and each part $2500 each. The sad thing is the apple idiots would pay it.
You know why it took them a year and a half? NO R&D DONE! They just took existing off the shelf items known to work together, built an enclosure around it, and called it a day. The companies they came from all did the R&D on their behalf (probably while they were working there, so in effect, they were part of the R&D process). Now all they had to do was take the years of R&D and mature products already out in the market ans put it in their own product.  Don't get me wrong, I love this idea. I just wanted to point out that fact. Instead of having "disposable" laptops (I'm looking at you Lenovo), you just have to nag Framework if ever this laptop starts misbehaving. And I do hope they have a decent level of customer service at that, since they are clearly banking on consumer loyalty to keep them going.
I was about to get one, but no GPU :(  for 3d artist it's badddd...
I love how hyped he is😂
I'm sold.
I could feel the smug on their faces like..... Take that Apple 😄😄 I would like to see them surpass others and be a top dog in the future who would eat other selfish tech giants as breakfast.
I'd argue that 1) the modular IO is useless in terms of upgrading and only useful in regards of not requiring a dongle and 2) the insides are pretty much like a 2011 MacBook from 10 years ago - thinner and better built after all it has been 10 years but part from the QR codes and colored screws (which is great by the way) this is the same as old laptops used to be.   Not that I didn't like it I really did and hopefully this can be more than a one-of however I doubt any LMG employee will be using that on a daily basis.
This is really awesome. How about Coreboot and open firmware / drivers as far as possible? Make a good, secure Linux box.
Are there any plans to offer 17 inch versions?
Remember the days when Apple made their Macintosh cover transparent or even signed inside them?
This is the best laptop. Hands down.
It is a very nice computer, however they didn't implement thunderbolt, it is only USB-c (please correct me if I am wrong). I really use thunderbolt GPU  when I need a bit more graphics power than Intel onboard graphics. They should definitely implement thunderbolt then it will be a complete package. I believe thunderbolt is a deal breaker. That is also the reason I would not recommend to invest on Surface laptops in their current state. At lease there should be an option (thunderbolt) with an extra cost (eg. 50$-100$).
That webcam is better than the one on the 16inch MBP
If my laptop dies OR I can sell mine for a descent price, this is definitely the laptop I would go for!
Jesus. That _necessary_ mask. Other than that, great laptop.
can it play vr  games ??
companies like this give me some hope in humanity
I'd like to have that laptop here in the Philippines. I support the right to repair.
Seems only available in the US currently. Pity but hope to own one soon.
I really hope this takes off.
Bios might look to simple and 90s but has better function than others.
What about GPU?
havent done the all important gaming test
Neat!  Where's the discrete GPU module?
I work as a computer technician for a school district. I could only dream of laptops and Chromebooks that were this serviceable and repairable. They're bound to generate less E-Waste too since one broken component no longer requires you to throw the whole thing out.
I know who i want to support when im ready to buy a new laptop! Hey Framework team, design a HUGE battery expansion module.
WOW!!! SERIOUSLY, WOW!!!! i'm sold!! I was about to buy the new M1, but THANK YOU LINUS! Normally i'm quite undecisive, but i'm sold, just purchased one!   ONE THING: you could have given us the option to choose any Linux distro. I know I can install by myself, but it would be nice to have this in the future for the average user that can't install a distro but would like to have Linux.   AND THEN IN THE FUTURE, PEOPLE WILL USE COMPLETELY UPGRADABLE LAPTOPS RUNNINGS LINUX DISTRO, i'm almost crying here, no joke!!!
Easy to swap drive lmao.... Tactical reload of harddrives?
This thing seems so great. Had I not just bought a new desktop pc I would probably order this laptop. I currently own a surface pro 4 (got it a couple of years ago) and I feel like the framework-laptop addresses a lot of problems I had with my device (like lack of storage upgradeability)
Great! Less waste!
I was, just a couple of days ago, grumbling about how nearly impossible it is to upgrade old laptops and why nobody will standardize the parts. This sounds very cool! Now if only they would stick to the same form factor on everything, so that all parts will work on any of their machines in the future.
You could have talked a bit about the price though...
I'm surprised Linus didn't nitpick on the small arrow keys. That being said, someone can probably sell a third party keyboard module that has the perfect layout for each individual.
The only thing I didn't see or mentioned it in there is the graphics card... sad...
Linus Geez Activate the fu**** windows😂
does linus actually cook in this kitchen
how about graphics card upgrade
Yooo that meth is starting to fuck with this dudes face already
A laptop for PC builders! I can't wait to get my hands on one.
I'm buying this
Big Woz is happy
Wow is it posibe..amazing bro
really cool and all but until they make a a PCIe expansion slot I'm not sold.
I'm a sucker for modularity and upgradeability, not only for sustainability reasons. All they need to make now is a keyboard with a trackpoint mouse and I'm in.
I just ordered mine now! :-D Cheers
This is amazing and I wish all laptops were like this. However they are counting on enough people like us to stay in business and unfortunetely I don't think there are enough of us buying a motherboard upgrade every 5 years for this to be sustainable. Unless they do kickstarters or something everytime to fund the upgrades.
I'm not in search of a new laptop and I usually prefer used high end stuff but I'll definitively consider them when they'll come to Europe. They may have hit a niche with lower margins compared to the average electronic producer but they can count on a really active customer base, product is a really uncompromised alternative to the rest, they'll be fine
Cough cough Dell...
The future of technology looks bright mein freunds
I'm fucking sold. I open laptops as a hobby and as a sideline and this just makes it very convenient. You do not have to worry that much if you break a notch or pull a wire because of how easy it is to open the backside. Not to mention that it's easier to unplug the display's cables. Well done Framework.   Now, the only thing I wanted to see in the future is having a second fan to cool the gpu.
Apple doesn't give a fuck about users, it's about getting more money
Imagine that you need 32GB to render something for one time, and your friend happened to have this laptop like u do,  Hey bro can i swap your RAM with mine for the next hour, how cool would that be !.
Nice video but Linus is very over the top with his reactions imho
It's gonna take a while to reach markets like India. Once it's here, we're doin' it man. Damn!
This makes me happy
You still cannot replace a GPU or a CPU. It's just like a normal laptop, but you pay more for branding.
Great idea, but a price of 1k USD for quite mediocre stats for nowadays in a base version? Heck no
We will watch frameworks career with great interest
Good job by laptop engineers. Best of luck!
I want it
Finally!
Good god man, what a freaky guy.
Wow, you know a product is fucking amazing when Linus reviews it the way he did with this one... I'm amazed by this
Big Laptop Companies: ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF
actually I don't see this laptop as an upgradable laptop it is just a new genera of dongles :D
This concept will never work untill the addons are universally adopted by the industry. But it's a very interesting concept, it's almost like a desktop computer.
Please shave off this beard 😂
14:30 next next next next like some kind of monkey 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Would they provide solder stencils? Especially for parts prone to breaking.
Can you please download addblock for chrome  so you don't need to blur advertisement )
A Bentley vs a kit car
How can this be made available in India ? I was drooling the moment I heard that it's a modular laptop.
I wonder how many of these would Steve Wozniak buy
Make it available for indian customer's
This is the most PERFECT laptop I've ever seen.. Hope this brand gets on mainstream 🔥
Hey, very nice!!! I love it!
Cough dell cough
Wait how does it perform for gaming? I’m curious if I should go for the Framework laptop for the Acer Nitro 5.
I'm seriously sold. However I'm very happy with my Dell. But as soon as the battery dies and a replacement cannot be found, I'm getting this (assuming they refresh it with newer CPUs)
It needs a Trackpoint keyboard, before I'm switching from Lenovo laptops.
Asus TUF Notebooks are actually somehow easy upgradeable too. Mine has two memory slots, four M.2 slots with two free slots, a 2.5" bay and a easy to swap battery. Yes, you need a screw driver and need to open the case for all of these but it is pretty easy to do and shouldn't take longer than 10-20 minutes depending on experience. I even saw a video about how to swap out the display panel and while it was defnitly more complicated than swapping the battery I still consider it moderately easy. We do not need consumer electronics which are super easy to modify and we do not need to modify every bit of it. But a good balanced effort as in the TUF series is a GREAT value. I upgraded my €800 TUF book (Ryzen 4600H, Geforce 1660Ti) to 32GByte memory and 2500GByte mass storage for €210. A steal. I do not care if I have to remove 6 or 12 screws to swap the battery, I just want to swap the battery at all.
Alex's reaction on Linus's "slight lip", priceless...
I'm gonna wait a year before I buy one of those, need to see if the company still lives by then, plus I don't have that kind of money to spend on a new laptop atm (students always short on cash)... But if the company is still around and kicking by then, heck yeah I want one of those
Very cool.
It is time to bring back project ARA !!! 😉 It is even more "futuristic" than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 ... and i LOVE that smartphone.
Louis Rossman :  *Cries into happiness*
Cant wait to put my 3090 into my new laptop!
8:17 is it really even an LTT video if Linus DOESN'T drop something at this point?
Wow I got an orgasm! Finally the RIGHT future is coming.
Liquid metal this and can you game?
I hope there will be a "qwertz" version in the future !!
If they make a wider one with a built in numpad I'm in
Well done Framework! I hope that they succeed and their support reaches Europe as well.
Its cool but I dont think that im ever gonna need it, im a desktop User and I dibt need a Laptop
I think I found my new laptop!!!!!!!! OMG!!!
Interesting, I like their philosophy. My desktop replacement gaming laptop will last maybe 2 more years still - if framework makes one themselves* until then and upgradable, this would definately be an option to be considered... For an upgradable device (bought an fairphone half a year ago) without glued parts I am willing to pay maybe 10 to 20% more. If it's possible to upgrade motherboard, CPU and graphicscard after three or four years for a reasonable price this is easily saved in the long run... *17", maybe two versions, about 20mm and about 30mm thick, a bay for one or two 2.5" drives, 1 display ports fix, a second as a module, 3x2 USB connexions, docking station and a huge (maybe external) battery with a flexible charging mode (I do not need battery for the next few days or weeks at least? Just charge it to 60% and let it alone until I say otherwise or it falls below 30% to expand battery lifetime, then it can be even an internal battery)...
I do believe that this is the future of laptops.
16:16 that's not what it's for, Lenovo laptops also have this, that function is so that you can disconnect the battery before you start working on the laptop's internals. I'm not sure it would work while plugged into the wall, that kind of defeats the purpose.
hmm nothing available in Australia yet, i suspect like everything else, we will pay more than the rest of the world.
No GPU?
Yup... Framework must be appreciated over other laptop manufacturers..👍🏻
Doodamajigs is my new favorite word
they can profit from personalization and style.  Seriously considering this.
Sword art online laptop???
Man you are a good actor 🙂
I wish it had full Thunderbolt compatibility.  Maybe next release.
Computers today are very easy to upgrade.  Sometimes...  *sigh*....  it's clear that Linus is thick as fudge.  How many components are made to fit those weird ports?
HOW MUCH MONEY!!!!????
Excited
Were they shipping to Australia, mine would be ordered. My current laptop is dyeing and this is exactly the replacement I have been looking for.  I love everything they are saying and have shown here.
Is ther gaming capabilities on this laptop ?
i want one but i live in australia so it seems to be a no-go for now...
Next laptop is found
in the Kitchen??😵
Cool !
this laptop concept is revolutionary and awesome, but still too expensive for an average indivisual
17:05
0:30 Anyone else get a nerdy woody for those clear key caps?
It’s good, but the market for it is limited at best
Modular Masterpiece 😍🔥
I have been looking for a non gaming laptop to do some work from and this takes the cake. I wonder if they will add Ryzen CPUs (just a personal preference atm) in the future if they do that then it is a shut up and take my money moment for sure. Guess I will wait and see.
Apple : We didnt see this video and We dont want our users to repair iphone (strong glue on back glass & faceid non repairable) , macbook (everything ) 🤣😂
Linus: All the drivers install in unattended mode. Mac users: Drivers?
Back in the day laptops had some modularity, the batteries were easy to swap, memories were similar to the ones of a big PC but slimmer and smaller. Also you had more plugs, there was the possibility to have integrated optical drives and there was the PCMCIA port. One of my old laptops had also a mudule for a TV tuner. It's quite a recent trend to have the batteries not removable and the whole need of the thinnest device. I never minded to have a somewhat fat laptop because my priorities are about it to have good ventilation and some modularity
I hope Framework makes their own Modular Gaming PC.
I think the tech industry also generally ignores people that want to customize or personalize their gear a bit. Like change out the entire back cover to have a portrait of someone or a cool something. Or maybe just a different colour depending on your mood. Think old Nokia phones (late 90s), where you could change the entire case.  Think is also, these things are dirt cheap to produce and people gladly spend 20-40 bucks on them. GLADLY.
I'm already in love with that little laptop...BUT... no delivery to Europe for now. grrrr
No graphics card options?  Can it game at all?
So it has all USB-C ports but the dongles are attached in a more flush manner. It’s not bad but it’s not that different from dongles. Being able to swap the internals is cool though.
Framework laptop is ship of thesis in technology 💯  I'm so glad that you made video on this laptop they need some exposure in market so they can sustain and innovate for years to come for users out there who wants productivity and upgradeable feature to save tons of money.
im just expecting in the future to have framework collaborate with dbrand
can we talk about how they spit in the face of apple and prove that replacing a battery is in fact do-able on a laptop even though apple will have it's consumers believe it's somehow an exploding hazard.
Upgradeable laptop, yet still uses a sealed battery?   WHY??????????
OMG I love this.  I have upgraded mine and my girlfriend's laptop many times and with mine the 32 screws I have to undo are a headache.  I even had to solder on a new power jack since after being kicked out so many times my original jack cracked. I use both a wire mouse and a wireless mouse/keyboard combo for watching youtube while connected to the tv.  Oh one caveat.  I have to have an upgradeable CPU. No soldered on CPUs nope.  I upgraded my gf's CPU on her Asus no problem.  Just getting the rice sized dab of heatsink was the tricky part.
For those who are old enough to remember a time when even a laptop's battery was user-serviceable, can see how laptop manufacturers have progressively gone off the rails over the years. Alienware's latest X15 doesn't even have upgradable ram, which is pathetic. I will be seriously considering buying from Framework for my next laptop.
I almost want that 'bulky clunky' laptop. XD You slap that thing down and it will stand out. I have always wanted to build a sleeper computer in like an 80s laptop case.
Licensed anime keyboards is how Framework will make buck with this company philosophy.
This seems good until in 3-5 years when the company doesn’t exist and there are no more replacement parts, or upgrades. We’ll see
The most important part for me in a upgradeable laptop would be the GPU which is not addressed at all in this video. I have a stack of old "gaming" laptops that all have at least a quad core CPU and 16GB of RAM min but the GPU is so old that I cannot use them for gaming anymore. All of these laptops would be viable again if only I could swap out the GPU as that is the single thing making them unusable.
They have a strong framework.  But I am pretty disappointed that you didn't do a stress test or run vidya games on it.

FRAMEWORK POGG
why are they so obsessed with making thin laptops? can i get a half inch thick boy with more functionality?
HAHAHAHAHHA 1:37
Where can I buy this?
INVEST
Imagine if they had an hdmi input for the screen. That would be dope.
Linus went full slap chop guy in this video
Defiantly buying this, my old MacBook is terrible and I need an upgrade that I can upgrade more in the future.

So, I've purchased 6 laptops from Alienware/Dell that have all exceeded $5,000 over the last 20+ years mainly because I work for an airline and am on the road more than home. I buy from them because of their great 5-year warranty, even though I know that they use a ton of used parts over and over (which I didn't mind as long as the laptop ran my games well). But I have to tell you, this is TRULY the first laptop that I hope to buy next when the time comes in 2 years. Why? Alienware still has a great warranty but the last two laptops both thermal throttle so bad and the fact that I can now replace bad parts easily (or upgrade them) means I no longer need an extended warranty. That is actually a huge thing.   I hope they work with parts manufacturers so that cool stuff like the keyboards or screens can be replaced easily. I HOPE they also start a buyback system so that I can sell my used parts back to them when I buy an upgrade. This provides two benefits: one is that I can upgrade whenever I want, but it also provides a path to buy USED parts from the manufacturer if I don't want to upgrade but simply have a hardware failure. This also solves the "right to repair" issue plaguing so many manufacturers like Apple that are fighting it HARD. Louis Rossman will be so happy to see this, lol! Make sure that Marques Brownlee also knows about this so that the word gets out! We need to try and support this company so that this becomes the standard, by this company leading it!
THIS IS THE FIRST ITERATION.  Imagine how good the next one will be!!!
13:13 the 3-to-2 ratio made me visibly pog at damn near 2:00 in the morning. It's, like, wider than 16-to-9 (which is cool) but not ridiculously wide to me.
That modularity is garbage. I want 20-30 ports on my laptop minimum.
Damnn i still enjoy the opening music😊
Wired mice are best Linus! 👍
They dont have Ryzen. Thats sucks.
Does it support external GPU on 3.2 with these connectors? Would be my go-to laptop but I wish they had Ryzen Mobile chips.
Looks fantastic BUT...Needs a 16-17 version with 6 configurable ports and graphic card options.
I thought this was a Linus imposter at first because he didn't drop the laptop...but then I saw his phone and was reassured.
I miss when my dell laptops had PGA processors. Stupid Intel doing away with them for laptop chips. Wish Dell had switched their Precision line to desktop CPU's to maintain that feature....
11:34 welp GGWP
I see that linus is a man of culture, he is also using a galaxy note 9
imo this is gonna be the next big thing in the hardware industry
Have that kind of laptop, an old p@nasonic one, but find the upgrades really hard
Can we appreciate the amount of plain cardboard and lack of plastic packages too?
it kind of looks like a MacBook
A dream rig for the RTR activist
The main problem with this is that the business works with larger markets like US. If this wants to include other markets with less population and/or less purchasing power, it will fail. And other problem is government regulations from different countries.
Hey @LinusSebastian, where did you get that cap you're wearing? I want one.
I like what I am seeing.
Wait till they add wireless charging modules AND EXTENDED BATTERY PACKS. HOLY SH*T!
this makes me so happy
Meanwhile what the Apple and Microsoft idiots are thinking: "Do we even NEED this screen? let them use an external monitor no one will care and the laptop will be thinner. also we could remove all ports and only use wireless charging and bluetooth! We are sooo smart!" Stupid IdIots
I want one so bad
When you employ hipsters that get paid for saying innovation and environment every 5 seconds instead of actual designers and engineers, you can't expect them to come up with anything revolutionary.

Seeing Legacy BIOS in 2021 just hurts.
This has to be the single coolest new piece of consumer tech I have seen in ages. Screw folding phones those things are dumb I WANT MODULARITY
I love how supportive this comment section is <3
Has anyone tried running any linux distros on this? I'm still traumatised by some OEMs (looking at you Sony...) whose system could not run ubuntu for example without a ton of pre-flight grub commands.
All laptops are completely upgradable you clickbaiting chipless breadboard. Most people just don't have the guts to take a screwdriver to the cosmetic chassis of their precious Toshiba to replace a component. Once you get into non-upgradable territory you're talking parts you couldn't change out even in a modular system.  Edit Correction: You COULD change them out, but it's cheaper and more efficient to invest in an overhaul or replacement of your outdated machine.
I'll get one if they make a 16" one with a gpu in the future.  I have my sights set on a Lenovo Ideapad 5 16" atm.
I remember there was a modular phone which flopped. I think this is a great idea.
My IBM R52 had a detachable cd drive and hard disk. You can easily upgrade it to DVD drive and hard disk capacity too.
Not a sell as my laptop is currently all good. But I am definitely looking into framework the next time I'm searching for a new one.
Dead in 2 years after they make their money
Remember: if you want the idea to succeed, you need to buy it.
The 800 lb gorilla in the room is the NON-UPGRADEABLE GPU!! Great step in the right direction, but the only thing that quickly becomes obsolete on a laptop is the GPU. It is the single most important component that must be made upgradeable, but alas, it is not.
APPLE, PLEASE
I get "Essential Phone" vibes from this kinda thing.  And that ended up a flop.
We need more laptops like this
My 3rd world ass can't handle the way his hands casually throws the laptop and flips it around like some piece of cardboard 😂😭
Imagine how advanced our society would be if this was popular in the late 2000s.
Quick, someone tell Louis Rossman
Macbook vs. Tektronix 465B oscilloscope. Tektronix wins.
I need this laptop....
I heard Jizz Kill. Who else?
Awesome product, awesome review!
can you game on this laptop?
Gentleman, it's time to get summer jobs
Is there an amd option/dedicated gpu option?
sad to see only has 2x wifi antennas. so slow 2x2 wifi support. whereas macbooks have had 4x4 (4 antennas) since 2011.
when I need a laptop, I'm buying one.
I'd be happier if it was a big chunkier and had dedicated graphics
What's the word on a GPU within the laptop? For this expense, it would be cool if we could get something better than Xe graphics on a laptop
Louis Rossman is gonna nut on this one
me: watching on a dell  linus: why dont we just roast dell the whole time  me: why would you do this to me-
This is a great start, I got memory while my ASUS was on it's way, and BAM!  I discover I have to void my warranty to open it, much less spend hours to add the ram.
1.1k dislikes from Mac employees And you guys just released a tq video called why laptop webcam suck This is a dream come true
NO ETHERNET MODULE IM CRUSHED
Me watching on a dell:  linus:a company failed to do this *cough *cough de cough* dell.  me: well thats just great.
I am not in the market for a laptop but will sure get this when I am shopping for one.
Waw
This laptop is like an "F you" to apple
Dbrand should totally customize stuff for this laptop
imagine we lived in a tech world where every company did this.... would be amazing
Get this shit into the algorithm
we need a repiarable laptop in order to save our enviroment we can make money without fucking our own nature
but what about a graphics card?
Hmmm I really love the philosophy here (always wanted an upgradeable laptop/phone), and was looking to buy, but sadly they only have one option for graphics?
There's no gpu
All the dislikes are from Apple and other proprietary  companies
this is desktop level futureproof, or at least as futureproof as a laptop could get. i feel like this would be amazing for students. imagine buying one of these in your freshman year of highschool, and upgrading and keeping it until your end of college?? in eight years, technology evolves so much, and you dont have to be stuck with the same laptop!
Every time they increase capacity for the server for the website, more people flood onto it. The cycle perpetuates.
Hey, how about the graphics card ? Are they replaceable too ?
That's cool! 😯I hope they do well enough to make more cool stuff.
Linus honey advert before Linus video. Coincidence... I think not lmao!
"so if you wanted to design your own case for it, You could." so what you're saying is: "you could potentially make a wood frame Laptop" or: "Framework can fund itself with 'designer' laptop frames sold at a premium."
Dell certified tech here, I hope this is as successful as it deserves to be. I would  be a great stride forward for both consumers and professionals.
Too bad that I: one, just bought a laptop to replace my ageing MacBook Pro (went Windows, though... can't afford Macs no more); two, have no means (and justification) to buy a second laptop; three, live outside North America (the shipping and custom charges would make this laptop no longer affordable). I would have definitely consider purchasing this laptop. I want this "philosophy" to succeed, I hope the company will be profitable and keep on supporting their devices.
Good in theory but lets be honest, besides RAM what are you going to upgrade on an ultra portable. Not like newer socket CPUs will be supported. I like the concept from a repairability standpoint but I cant see what would be supported down the track in terms of an upgrade path.
Apple would definitely do this... Then charge an arm and a leg for each and every little chip
Well my next laptop will be this. I opened my macbook pro and had to drill bcz the screw thread got damaged.
Has to be Usb 4 before I buy it. It's 2021.
Does it run windows or linux ?
Could... could this be the beginning of a truly universal laptop form factor?
This is what I should’ve bought instead of  a soldiered ram hyperbook.
3 minutes in and I turbo-like this thing
goooodd stuff.... easy to maintain..i had this idea about spare parts if you want ... like you can get the laptop and a box of spares if something goes wrong... but this would riese the price... but again if someone can manage it when something blows up he can just change it...and again if you dont want to buy spare parts... dont buy them.....
Thank you so much for this review.  I've been exploring the idea of changing to laptops after having a desktop for so long for the sole reason of replace/upgrading parts.  Now that the age tech has improved, I've been doing some research for a new future laptop.  This changes everything for me, again thank you very much!
Framework comes out with this incredible modular laptop, and Valve comes out with Steam Deck. It's turning out to be a good year for new tech!
Was just me nervous about the way Linus holds the laptop?
They didnt include a blank connector? For someone who is building a business laptop where he doesnt want anyone randomly connecting thier flash drives lol
I Am So Confuse About this
I'd like regular ddr4 instead of sodimms personally
This is awesome, I love this.. and this what right to repair should be - something market led, not something forced on every manufacturer. If this is as good as any other laptop and provides repair and upgradability, it should move manufacturers to this model. For the love of God, I hate the idea of enforcing right to repair.
I hope they make some motherboards with an amd ryzen cpu, then I'll buy one. Just because of the price/performance/temperature balance.
Looks cool better choice than a Chromebook
gotta miss rPGA, tbh the right to repair should banish the fkn soldered chips, it's moronic, ofcourse some laptops really cant support higher power CPU's than they have cause of the abysmal cooling but it's better to have options.. rPGA was a gift, BGA was a poisoned gift..  also why won't they make some adapter board thing? pretty sure it shouldn't be too hard to upgrade when they make that as both the 10200H and the 10980HK use the same BGA (1440)  I mean it's really intel's fault to stop producing them but for an upgradeable laptop?
i am ordering it
most people won't read it XD, they'll wrong this laptop. Then again, most people won't buy it
If only they had an upgradable motherboard I would buy it imagine an upgradable GPU and CPU bro oh my God
I so want this! if only I needed a laptop rn
The school I work for orders new laptops every year, I may have to start pulling some strings and asking around.
Please come to India as soon as possible
I've always said "fuck the industry" for not making laptops just as assemble-able as custom gaming PCs, and also, "whoever does it first will be rolling in money."
Commenting so you show up in my recommended again...
Didn't know there were cpus soldered to the boards.   Took apart some Thinkpads recently (fairly new ones) and they all had removable CPUs and even one had a removable graphics chip for some reason.
You guys coming to India anytime soon? Need one of these.
That's really cool
I LOVE that it is NOT touch-screen!! This just keeps getting better and better! I gotta get me 2 of these!!
Doesnt look like this has a modular graphics card.  It would be nice if it did, even an external one for high end gamers or video editing.  You can just undock when you dont need it.
Did I miss the part where there's a graphics card?
No GPU sort of kills it for me, if they could do modular GPUs then I would completely be sold.
so... nothing new here
This sounds really cool, but I kind of want a gpu (and ideally an amd cpu).  I hope they have some gpu models by next year. I tend to keep my hardware a LONG time.
And the Camera is 60 FPS 1080P. God...........
"...the power button/fingerprint sensor was built by goodix and features Linux drivers"  TAKE MY MONEY! Well, my I'll stay with my Ryzen laptop for now until it's obsolete and Framework releases AMD models, but if they're still arround and not a failed project by the time I need an upgrade I'll probably buy from them.  Seriously, we need more manufacturers releasing Linux drivers.
God, why didnt I know about this before I went ahead and spent way too much for my work laptop. I'm seriously considering on retuning it now.
Things that worry me are: 1. I have to buy every parts from them in order to upgrade, what if Framework is done or jack up the price for the parts 2. Most parts are connected via usb 3.2, which could be outdated in couple days
If they offered 144hz screen and thunderbolt so i can connect an external GPU (with at least 8 pcie lanes) then I'm sold. And in black.
its a laptop no one cares it still cant get half the power a pc can
But what are the Graphics Chipset?
They need to add external PCI-E bus connectivity to make it a real hit.
With a Coreboot, it would be a dream laptop!
2:31 I don't know where you found $300 of savings on the DIY model... If you take the base $749 and add the RAM, SSD, charger and modules you're pretty much at the same price as the $999 base model but you don't have windows, which you would have with the prebuilt.  I noticed the SSD and RAM are marked up quite a bit so I'm going to source my own.   Edit: I ordered the DIY i5 a few days ago. It ships in October. These things are selling fast 😁
Here is my one question:  Can it accept an external graphics card? Or does the USB 3.2 spec not support that?
I’m very excited with this laptop bc I’m looking to buy one to replace my MacBook Air. Now, could you please call the big guy and assess if this laptop works with Ubuntu or any other Linux distro? Many thanks, Jonathan.
Linus realizing a modular laptop allows third party manufactures to violate other companies pattents and make modular magnetic charging connectors for this laptop: _it's free real state._
I want one.  Not because I need a laptop, I just wanna throw money at these guys.
this is what the world needs !!!!!
I remember reading about a modular phone before and always thought it was a cool idea
it gets the Linus "Squeal of Approval"
Where to BUY
It’s amazing… sucks that it’ll flop.
as always, indi/small companies are saving an industry being strangled by corporate greed.
I REALLY wish they would have added a USB-C to power it WITHOUT having it be one of the modules! It would have given you 4 modules to use. But you basically NEED to use one for USB-C to power it.  Imagine 4 storage modules! You can't now. Awesome idea and execution. But just like the head phone jack, there should have been a USB-C for the power on it's own.
Could this be a Hackintosh’ers mobile wet dream?
I wish thunderbolt on this for my eGpu.
What are the gpu options?
This laptop is something we've all been waiting for for years, and its been possible for years. what a paradox
I absolutely love this! Right now I have a Chromebook (can’t be repaired or upgraded, period), a Dell Inspiron, and a very old and cheap HP laptop. The Dell Inspiron can be user-repaired but it is a GIANT pain in the ass. I’ve opened the chase many times to swap RAM and upgrade the hard drive to different sizes of HDD then to SSD. I went with the Inspiron *because* before I bought it, I researched to make sure I could DIY. The average consumer wouldn’t take time to learn though or feel comfortable doing upgrades themselves on it though.   The old HP laptop is now serving as my home network’s server. Because of its age I installed Ubuntu which is lighter on resources and then installed Pi-Hole. I’m using Samba on it too to file share across my home network (5 TB storage total). However when I upgraded the HDD to more storage it SUCKED getting to the SATA port. Had to disassemble literally the entire laptop case + hardware to swap SATA HDD. I’ll never make upgrades to that system ever again, I’ll just buy a different laptop used if I need to replace the current server setup I built.   But yes, make parts easy to swap or replace!!! Great product idea and I hope they turn into a really successful brand.
bruh my laptop has a removable CPU
The price: spec ratio better be good in order to sell..
If they could put an m.2 to pcie4 socket for external GPU, that would be awesome 😍
I really believe THIS is the future we were all thinking of.
What about ESD while playing with it
This is the coolest thing in tech I've seen on years
Wait don’t Clevo / Sagers have CPU’s that aren’t soldered?
This somewhat reminds me of System 76's laptops, the company is so friendly about letting you upgrade the laptop yourself that they even give you a manual on how to do so, something that you'd never find an Apple product letting you do.
If they made something like this, with zen 4 and RDNA3 I would buy instantly  And a second one if they made an ARM version
I hope they come out with a 17 inch version with a number pad.  I also wouldn’t mind a thick brick of a laptop as long as it fits in a normal laptop bag or backpack if it lets me run some modded Skyrim or CAD software without chugging.
I will order a Ryzen 5 Version in the Future. Hopefully with a touch OLED Panel. Really good project
Not Thunderbolt though… right? Not 100% Linux friendly yet! In the works last time I read info on it. I Will not run MS on a computer again.
You just shown me my next laptop, also the one after and the one after that.
I hope Framework are figuring out about swappable GPU. It's gonna be thick, but that's a hell of a feature.
I will be ordering one ASAP.
:)
Apple a liberal company (just about all computer companies nowadays for that matter) doesn't want the end use to fix their own products because liberals care more about their profit margins then you (take amazon, another liberal company for example. Which also treat is own workers like garbage). A hypocritical company who really doesn't want to give up using slave labor. How else are they going to pay for their 5 billion dollar corporate play place? That building is going to help so many of biden's bla.........poor kids!
In the hiren’s boot cd there was a network discovering device driver that works in no time and probably still working on newer PCs
The irony of MicroCenter sponsoring a laptop that they won't sell...
What about GPU ?
Omg only 3 things are miss is laptop are teach screen back fold like tablet detachable screen & dual os support android and windows 10 I will love to buy it
It’s obvious they will need to make another model in the future, and that is when I’ll buy in
the one thing i want most in the world ill have to wait 7-8 years for.
18:19 ROFL
Great review and information on this laptop. But could you not hold it and swing around while speaking? Made me anxious that you might drop and break it by accident. 😂😂
Ive been building PCs for a While now. First was a Pentium 4.  Im all for modular. When it comes to a PC. When it comes to a phone. I still run with iPhone. Im all for people having the options to replace The screen, some ports and half your motheboard on your phone. Probably at a  higher environmental cost than replacing the phone complitely. But hey, at least you feel good about yourself.  But, you should really take care of your phone to begin with instead. When ut comes to changing battery. Im all for it. 👌
isso é bem legal mas faz lembrar dos computadores antigos que tinha isso e hj não tem como atualizar, o problema e que começam com uma boa ideia e depois descontinuam.  (smartphones modulares )
Lol thats just a laptop that come with a few extra dongles... i mean it cant upgrade a screen from a 1080p to a 4k one, cant swap cpu 😂
This thing is frikkin' sweet! I really hope it's Hackintosh compatible. My MBP is almost 10 years old and, while it's still running fine, I know it's only a matter of time before important (and non-servicable 😡 ) parts begin failing. I'm utterly uninterested in rewarding Apple for their glue-solder-seal crap, but most of the software I use doesn't have Linux alternatives so it would cost me beaucoup coin to switch to Windows.
The gears of war crimson omen laptop it seems lol
7:52 I can't tell you how much joy it gives me to watch someone call out Linus in real time.
Could 100% see this in public schools and colleges to teach beginner level courses in computer technician fields and more.
I'm already ordering mine!! Glad I waited!
We should support this laptop to let tech giants know that they are not someone who will control our choices.
Framework's site mentions you can upgrade the motherboard.
Lessgoooo
Two quick questions: 1: Will windows still be valid if/when  you upgrade the motherboard/change the hardware spec? 2: whats the graphics set up and upgrade options in the future?
Patents on magnetic jacks/plugs should be thrown out. That is such a BS patent.
I would but... They're gonna need a dedicated GPU on that motherboard first.  And maybe a larger version. This has tons of potential though.
Meh
Glad to see that they’re already selling out batches. This is something that technology has been lacking for a while.
Linus, sees modular laptop, almost tests that out less than 2 minutes in via an accidental almost-yeet
And Thats how you care for the environment not by removing chargers from the box Apple
'cry me a river linus' best line.
you can make anything pretty with a strapped on housing(preferably a lockable one to discourage more subtle thefts), it's the accessibility of the components and availability/desire to swap them that makes something supposedly modular become something of a trend setter (most often seen in mechanical devices due to a vast array of users, a mainline platform most people accept and the desire to personalise said devices).
This is the first big change made on a computer design for thast 10 years.
mom... this is what i want
As a software developer, the modularity of this laptop speaks to me. I might get one soon.
Linus, the channel is great. But please stop with the ridiculous thumbnail images, youre starting to look like Riptrippers.
gib me a 19 inch display and i'll get one.
The only thing that would interest me about a "modular" laptop would be gpu choices, but there aren't any.  Without that, its WAY overpriced.
They should package those modules in boxes that look like Gameboy games.
Please add a black version with 16' 16:10 screen!
you wanna know why i watch this channel.its informative and funny and interesting and accurate but most of all this channel and this company will not under any circumstances give or be paid for a good review even when its the huge companys.you linus are a real gentleman and i really mean that.a man amongst men and really decent team.you have integrity and a strong urge to keep an honest company and a good audience.i respect that and im sure a lot of your subscribers do too i wish you all the luck in the world.
I want this in the UK.
Why do you want a touchscreen on a laptop? I could see if it were a convertible or 2-in-1...
When did Jake Paul start doing tech reviews???
Shit that's cool, between this and the fairphone maybe the planet stands a chance
1:57 #linusdroptips
This seems pretty revolutionary! Hope more companies do this kinda stuff in the future.....a laptop thats completely customizable inside and out?  We're gonna be comparing them to Mustangs and Miatas!  Ok bad analogy, cuz I have a limited knowledge of tech and cars, but you get the idea!
The only thing this thing needs is obviously the people themselves. I urge the would be laptop buyers to support this by buying this instead so that the manufacturers will have to adopt their philosophy. Let's face it, no matter how innovative and cool this product is, if it doesn't sell well, they will have to force to discontinue and that will be so sad. Im stoked in buying this product. ❤️
While it's interesting, Clevo is better, cheaper, and has been doing it longer. Just without the fancy dongle ports. I just can't justify the price when there's no gpu, no immediate availability, and the company doesn't have a clear future. I do support the possibility that it'll reduce e-waste. But, look into Clevo for the upgradability or ASUS for a gpu strong reasonable price laptop. I'll check back in with Framework in another 5 years... If they're still around...
i LOOOOOVE the idea, ii just wish they had also a bigger version made for content creation... if they get a version like that i will be on board all the way! the philosophy they have its just what we need as users
I'm buying one of these laptops on principle alone
This kind of laptop was my dream since highschool
Will it run iOS ??? 🙏🏻
Would love to support but without a GPU, this is a pass for me. Hope to see them rollout a model with GPU modules in the future!
Please send me the address in Europe where to buy it.
Please send me the address in Europe where to buy it.
As a neanderthal I approve of this this company's thought process.
That will be my next laptop if they make an AMD version
Wired mouse gang
But does it have a gpu? Can we game on it?
That's my dream!!! Also, I can imagine using SSD expansion modules to host different OS. E.g. one SSD256 module will host Linux, another -- Win10. If I need to work in either OS -- all I need to do is to replace the module.  Thanks for the review, have ordered DIY version. Just wondering if you can confirm the USB TYPE-C Extension has Thunderbolt support and if yed -- is it TB3 or TB4? P.S. Hi from Toronto, ON. 😉
I'm going to buy one. Same with the Fairphone. I'm going to buy one of each and be a Repairability Vegan about it, i.e. tell people with non-repairable stuff that I'm better than them.
GPU is the main thing that should be swappable , kinda kills the deal ..
dang I kinda want to get the setup to yank it apart and put that motherboard into an original NES shell lol
AMD CPU's and linux driver support for Nvidia GPU's. That's all I ask for.
"here's a usb-c, yoink" - this guy needs to up his game. There's a usb c cable plugged into every place people can charge a phone in my house plus 50% extras so you can always find a second
finally a laptop empowers the user!
Actually Panda Project had a modular future proof PC that was easy to upgrade with I/O expansion cards, CPU/GPU expansion cards, RAM expansion cards utilizing a design for 256-bit computing support.  These days you might call it a Blade style of computer.  Modular support of drive cages meant you could expand your media drives and storage to whatever you needed.  It didn't matter what new standards came out as the whole PC was designed for easy upgrades.  And when the market went to 512-bit computing well they had that in the works as well.  It too was a commercial product that unfortunately fizzled due to extravagant prices.
linus exited lol 11:53
Wow I want one and I have 0 use for a laptop. That's fucking neat.
Woz would love this
It's actually surprisingly affordable as well.  Couple this with an external GPU system that runs either through thunderbolt, USB-C or via PCI-E and you've got yourself a modular gaming beast.
apple is just a shit company but people are blinded by the "must have this" mentality that they cant leave them behind
If they had ryzen cpu options I'd upgrade tomorrow.
Well I obviously wouldn't expect Apple to be the ones to develop something like this.  They're a fashion company.  I don't look to Louis Vitton to make a breakthrough in cordless drills or Gucci to come out with a RISC-V CPU.
Im buying this for sure
If it can have a 360degrees/tablet touchscreen format that can extend keyboard / eGPU / high end CPU and so on, it'd be my dream. I would love to have just one system that is small and also smth for work duty.  I want smth like I have been doing with my desktop for over 25 years: modular and upgrade different parts as I go. Heck I still use the same case for my desktop for 13 years...
So the modules swap out with just USB 3.2? So in theory I could switch that second drive between computers if the laptop breaks?
I’m sold. I’ll get one - no jokes.
This is the future.
Yeah I'm gonna need an IPO from that company. That's an amazing product that they've developed! Plus a good long term plan.
Excuse ME? Where´s Linus? Did I miss something? This is muscular Linus!!! :D 😍
No optical drive bay in a tower, no dice.  As for the laptop, is the GPU upgradeable or replaceable?
Wasn’t there like 20 of those modular innovative companies that promise so much and their amazing support and how one device will last? Even recent modular Motorola phone.   Idea is great but main offenders which are graphics card and cpu are soldered to board. I hope it stays and works out this time but a bit sceptic
I still don't understand right to repair. Is there a law that makes it illegal to work on our devices? The only thing I understand is that they need to make parts available. I saw several times where you could have damaged the laptop. They void your warranty if the damage is your fault, which I see nothing wrong with. It's just like if you damage your screen. Manufacturers shouldn't be held liable for user damage.  Watch my channel and you'll see how I open up every computer and replace parts. Most people won't learn how to do board level repairs, so I'm a little curious on what right to repair does other than making other parts available.
All I can say is holly molly. I think I found my next Laptop. A fully specked DIY one from the website is only $2250 ? Heck of a deal with the ability to swap out key internals in the future. The size and weight is just fine for majority of users. But the simplicity of being able to replace stuff yourself is priceless. I love how this company is establishing a friendly end user relationship on upgrading unlike most other laptops. I am looking forward to seeing bench marks for Graphics used for gaming and video editing on this. Can't wait to try one out towards the end of next year when I will need to replace my current laptop. I also like the business model of repeat business being in the upgrading key internals in the future. If done right this will be a huge hit with customers not only with laptops but full on PC in the future.
This is the solar opposite to Dell and Apple.. I love it!!
This needs to be the standard now if we can get the upgradable consoles.
This is exactly what we need! I would buy one for sure! I'm so tired of proprietary generic this is what you get products.
8:18 yes
Ok I’m sold
dell and apple just got executed
Why didn't you show this 2 months ago when I was buying a new laptop? CURSE YOU!
People should just boycott non-modular laptops. Would you want a non-modular PC? Hell no. So why would you want a non-modular laptop...? And let's have replaceable notebook CPU's as well, please!
Interesting
While I would like it to succeed, i'm not the intended audience. I'm far too cheap.
"the Dells not even fucking thinner!"
A dream come true, no going back now laptops should always ne this way. I'd hope for an AMD APU build or cpu/gpu slots in the future. Customizations sounds fun though, would love to replace the track pad with a mini arcade stick. I have my reasons.
They need to make a chonky “portable Desktop” laptop like for real fully customizable.
This is just a MacBook Air with extra steps
Bro who edited this 😂 11:52
It this video cut by a new member of the team? This new effects, this not 100% correct blur into the sponsor at 17:49...
I love tinkering. Last year I bought an old Dell Latitude E6540 just to be able to upgrade it. The latest models didn't have a rom drive. My  budget hobby of the year. But I will take a long look at Framework. Thanks Linus!
I peeped that broken rear on your phone LOL I expected nothing less from Linus!
Linus switched really fast into a "12 year old child at christmas" mode. I dont blame him. It really looks awesome. Also like things that are logical and have common sense. I hope they wont go bankrupt.
Spreading the word, I need one of these.
hmm...
After the switch comment at the end the video ended with a switch ad
this company will either explode with popularity or be bought out and destroyed by a major competitor.
Would love this but no swedish keyboard :(
This is the first time in a long time I've been impressed with a laptop offering.
God damn thats a fine laptop
i think they missed a big oppurtunity by making the CPU not upgradeble and not adding an additional GPU! Like linus said, the most important parts like storage and ram are already upgradeable on many other laptops. The average guy will never upgrade the Wifi module or anything else beside the storage.... He doesnt even want to. He want to buy a laptop that runs immediatly after pressing the power button. And thats it.  And having the same Case for 5 years? im telling you many will buy a new laptop just to have a refreshing look or even just to have a new laptop. Not because its broken or anything else... They should focus more on the repairability of their laptop.
pro tip when watching LTT:  as soon as you hear linus do his segway to a sponsor, doubletap L (skips 20 seconds).   by doing this, you skip the sponsorship and the introm, works on 99% of their videos
Perfect for a omen right in the middle
I just had a techgasm. Buy them people, that's supporting a company that actually gives a F
i love it
This is fucking amazing. Absolutely game changing
NileRed spotted?
Note that the DIY laptop is really $300 cheaper. It's base model is $963.00 vs. $749. But the DIY base price doesn't include an operating system, RAM or storage that is included in the prebuilt. So that's a $214 difference in price, but if you add even the 250GB NVMe drive (+$66), 8GB of RAM ($49), and Windows 10 Home ($139) that are included in the base model pre-assembled laptop, it costs $1003... which is actually more expensive. So unless you are going to BYO components for at least some of the laptop, or at least are going with Linux instead of Windows, you are better off going with a preassembled laptop.
This gotta be fast forwarded
Everybody that loves this, go follow their social media. It's not a purchase, but it does indicate support. The larger following they have, the more it signals a demand. :)
Gonna buy one if they ever come out with a touch screen
Finally this might be THE ONE
this is great. I just replaced the fans and battery in my laptop and it was great. I also upgraded the RAM and added more storage when I got it.
I want someone to start a channel called Linus minus sinus. They basically replay every video but through the power of video editing they remove his nose and distort his voice to sound like he's talking with his nose pinched
I just low how smashed linus phone is...XD drop much
This is the most agreement to a product I've seen from Linus in a while
Pre-ordering from the laptop you’re placing an order for is somehow kinda baller ngl.
They only make them "non-upgradable" so you have to pay to fix/upgrade them
Upgrading laptop's storage has never been this easy!
I would guess about 90 percent of computer users don't care about upgrades.
Unfortunately it lacks RJ45 module for now. That`s a shame because it would be very useful for testing and setting up network hardware.
I skeptical that their manufacturing process is scalable to the level of Dell or Apple.
"Activate Windows"  17:30
graphics card. The one piece that you need to be able to upgrade. not there
I had previously watched a video about this laptop and wasn't sold. Until I saw this video and got immediately hyped!
I want to see this company succeed. Many company that say they’re trying to be “environment friendly” this is environment and user friendly
Neat idea, but I'll wait for a 15.6" model with a GPU. Preferably one that can take standard 2.5" SATA drives.
At 03m00s - Ex-engineers? Did they suddenly forget how to engineer? =:oO [LOOKS AT THE PRODUCT] Well, clearly not!  Oh, you mean "Engineers who used to work for..." $LIST_OF_COMPANIES".  =:o}
was wondering why my desktop was heating up while watching this vid
Wow.  (Sideways glance at my Asus gaming laptop with a dead, non-removeable battery...)
I am gonna buy it 100%.
Well very nice mostly for office stuff and a basic user experience - buuut not a gamer configuration with those heatpipes for sure ^^ Schenker XMG is fine too, you can often replace the processor and it is not so hard to change things, they have videos for mostly everything
Really interesting laptop! Dell though definitely is not the "gold standard" for flex...
If you're looking for the compromise, it's made by the manufacturer. They deliver a better product, but they don't get to charge you for a new motherboard or a whole new device when something goes bad.
What a great idea!  WIsh I could afford it 💸💸💸
getting one when selling on brazil.... so never.
if they sell these in my country... people will never change their laptop
LINUS!!! You HAVE to give APRIME more creative FREEDOM!!! :D :D :D That guy is a GENIUS!
Send one to mr Rossman
This is crazy!!!
Louis Rossman’s wet dream
The gleaming money recently bruise because pine physiologically rejoice off a ordinary tile. spicy, lame decrease
I want this to catch on and do great so big oems will see this is what people want, however having been in this industry long enough to get cynical I know it won’t, not yet at least, and it won’t change much... I want to be so wrong...
no one is judging you Linus I also use a wired mouse
I hope the first port they add to the mix is Ethernet.
I am a HARDCORE Apple fanboy who's been using Macs since 1984 and I'm still really tempted by this.
You cannot beat our coconics... Lol, Only Indian Kerala people can understand
wonder how upgradable the graphics are. I didn't see anything about that. with a desktop i can change out the video card making it last longer because the gpu upgrades are generally more important then the cpu upgrades to game performance in most instances. if the gpu is integrated into the MB then you basically have to buy a new MB each time.
tbh linus, we both have been telling people that building a gaming pc is a simple as building lego, people still won't build a gaming pc themselves. this laptop is cool for tech enthusiasts like us, not for the average customer
The black bars in the video are distracting me. It's too cinematic... It's weird.
Sad that no AMD CPUs available (
I like this idea. As a Linux user I love this way of thinking about the manufacturing of a laptop 👌 strong candidate for next purchase
What does the graphics situation look like? _pun intended_
Who would have thought that tiny hand linus could grow such a giant beard
Overpriced. Not much more modular than prebuilt laptop
really wasn't expecting this to be so cool. wow this thing kinda rules lol
I'm in love 😍
We need this. We need the monopolies to understand that rippin off their customers for not providing choices and making excuses whilst taking slow-tech-evolution as an excuse is not going to work. But we also need people to be made aware of right to repair.
no amd options, vague posts from developers... without a dedicated gpu intel is just too weak... i guess you could get a 1200+$ external gpu, but then is it really a complete laptop. You know, if it can only render/game when on a desk at home.. they should have just done a amd apu dropped the price and i would have JUMPED ON THAT.... But they don't even seem to sell non-intel products lol... all intel cpu all intel wifi... one of the Great plan but terrible execution...   TLDR::: Screw intel, and therefore framework...
Apple removed the charger saying TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT  but you/they CAN'T/WON'T REPAIR AIRPODS AND APPLE WATCH Just buy a new one Yeah, Screw Planet Earth in that case  🙂🙂
you got me on board  with magnetic charge port !!!
I bet you can even install whatever OS and apps you want... unlike horrifically locked down Apple and Google devices.  Framework phones next, please.
Stupid patents.  Well patents are great but when assholes are patent trolls...
the M1 chip MacBook Air is a lot cheaper and a no brainer for me..
"Hol up" Louis Rossman
Not the cheapest around, and it doesn't appear to have an AMD option, (though that's presumably straightforward to achieve). Still a very attractive concept. If you're interested, the PineBook Pro might be worth a look, too.
Can we just appreciate how good this little part is at 11:54 to 11:58
This video is so good I watched it twice 🤣
If I were getting a laptop, this would be the one I'd want. This is the sort of plug-and-play I wanted back in the Pentium 2 era when every component was replaceable but took 76 proprietary screws to install.
So ready for tempered glass trend to be over
This is the first laptop featured on this channel that I actually want to buy
100% this will fail lol
E-ink display and I'm ordering a half dozen.
Screws are a better fastener than adhesive. Honestly you don't the important part of a car together with glue...
ffs could u put any more links in the comments
WOAH. That thing is awesome!
Looks very cool. Hope they will release in Europe as well (since there only is a US/CA charger right now). Some more expansion things would be nice. I'm also wondering why there's only 1 slot per expansion thing. It could have 2 USB-A or 3 USB-C on a single one if they wanted to. And ethernet would be nice too. I'll keep em on my list but I'm gonna wait while they get more options and expand to Europe. Regardless, kudos on the device, looks pretty solid.
I checked their configurator, it lacks full size SD Card Slot  (i hope they figure it out by the time they open orders to my country, i might actually go for it then)
most impressive Laptop ive ever seen!
What is the ceiling treatment https://youtu.be/0rkTgPt3M4k?t=906 at 17:53
Framework advertises and puts QR codes inside their laptop, while Apple will try to sue you for taking theirs apart. Hmmmm
Didn't G.SKILL buy the segway?
I hope you will be able to replace the cpu+motherboard at some point (and keep the screen and everything else).
What if they put the CPU on its own separate modular board so you could just buy a new one and slot it in?
I can't believe this. Is no one going to address the major FLAW this laptop has?  I can't immediately buy it from the EU 😭
I was waiting for Linus to drop it when he said, "one of the ways you can test the durability of a laptop".
I've never seen Linus try and rip into a laptop so hard as this one and not come up with any fatal flaws. It passed the ultimate test. This is embarrassing for the big laptop manufacturers and a HUGE leap in the direction of reducing E-waste. What an absolutely groundbreaking product.
This is the coolest laptop I've seen.
This kind of innovation has been absent for quite awhile and it's great to see it make a come back.  Framework kudos to you all this I feel is what portable users really need but may not know it yet because of the ripoffs that are sold as normal today.  Keep it up this will be slow to catch on initially (Lazy consumers hence iPhones) but once it does it'll blow up World wide and become the new norm.
I want one so bad But my lappy is only a year old. I can't justify it.
You bought the segway to your sponsor or your sponsor bought/paid for the time to advertise on your platform? 🤣
What about the performance?
It's similar to the fairphone.
This is incredible!
Incredible product, however, what about the GPU?
VERY cool laptop!!! , but WHERE IS RyZen CPUs?? Where is MXM GPU option? Fixed in next gen?
Now i want a Laptop... damn
They need to bring back user upgradable GPU's in laptops.
wired mouse crew reporting
I'll order one once CPU / GPU upgrades become possible in laptops! :)
This might be the best piece of tech LTT has ever shown off
Haha my laptop is from 2011 get rekt
This awesome, but not cheap. It’s on par with the majority of ultrabooks, I guess…
Lenovo also has a way to stop the battery from charging as well
Hoping these guys will ship to Belgium. What an awesome product.
Linus talks about this around 11 minutes but this doesn't really add anything new to the table. Most laptops support upgrading RAM or SSD's. They don't generally support upgrading CPU's, which this doesn't either. You also can't add or upgrade a GPU. It is easy to get in to and you can physically change the I/O but with USB-C you can turn that in to just about anything anyways.   I love the idea but so far it's not really doing anything crazy
Framework: big pp bois hop in chat rn  *Intel has joined the chat* *Western Digital has joined the chat* *Micron has joined the chat* *Lite-On has joined the chat* *PixArt has joined the chat* *Goodix has joined the chat* *Windows has joined the chat* *Linux has joined the chat*  Framework: oh yeah, it's all coming together  *Noctua has joined the chat* Noctua: I heard a laptop company needed a better laptop cooler?
I have fixed laptops, I have to make a template and put the screws on it so I know where they came from. It's an awful job. Your talking half an hour just to change a keyboard, this is the future.
Hopefully we start to see some AMD Variants soon!
I love this thing. I love everything about it. I say that as someone who is a Mac user these days.
micro center.... if u'r watching this..... come to europe too pls!!!
Dedicated gpu and german keyboard layout and im in :D.
Add-on pcie port for eGPU, let's go framework, give Alienware/Razer HELL!
Hopefully they will ship to the Netherlands soon
Man I love this. I'm happy I can take apart my legion 5 I just got tho. I can definitely see Lenovo influences in this. If I hadn't got my legion this would be in the running of possibilities for sure
Damn Ive been trying to learn to do exactly this for ages. FFS. My early drawings and designs date back to 2013. But neither amd nor intel ever responded to emails about sourcing (buying) a test motherboard with documentation. Fuck small garage startups right
Get me a 360 hinge/pen support and AMD guts and this is my new mobile rig.
11:53 This was some weird editing
i know a guy that can fix that phone for ya ;)
activate windows is still there XD
Suck it Apple!
This makes me so EXTCITED!!!!!!!!!
Interesting idea, but still a pretty penny.  It's been a very long time, and quite a few laptops, since I've replaced anything beyond drive, memory, and maybe battery.  What generally goes are the hinges and hinge point of the chassis.  Thinkpad used to be the gold standard for chassis.  How durable will this design be with daily open/close cycles?  Fans are also weak points, so it's good to see that one seemingly easy to replace.  The I/O choices are slick, I'll grant you since USB ports can wear or be broken, and the battery disconnect is brilliant.  I'd want to see a SATA bay or second M.2 drive slot - some nod to expansion without having to rip and replace a primary drive.
Meanwhile, in Apple's lair: "Hey do we really need this power jack!?"
On application: "How did you find out about our job opportunities? "  Answer: I got the link off of a sticker on my motherboard.
Can i ask could dell lattiude 5000 series its a touch screen and slot in desktop gpu?
Luv it!
Yeah....this is going to be my next laptop.
Omg omg omg this is super cool. I know you guys review a lot of products and they're usually pretty cool, but this is one of the only truly exciting devices I've seen in a long while.
This need to be a standard tbh.
What if they had a larger model with a dGPU that was possible to upgrade too? They would dominate that market segment.
I love this guy 😂😂😂
That's a bit counter productive though because the modular elements are still proprietary... Overall awesome though. I hope it succeeds
So can i run linux on this and not have any issues?
Apple: We don't do that here
My current laptop is a Dell E6540, with replaceable WiFi, 2nd drive (hard or optical), RAM, and *CPU*.  The CPU is soldered to a board that is swapped.  I'm a little disappointed that Framework didn't adopt this approach.  Nonetheless, they have a more expandable product than anything else currently on the market (that I've seen).
I actually screamed when I realized that all of these components were standard USB connectors so even if you can't get a hold of the modular parts, you can use regular USB-C devices in their place
Are the modules hot swappable?
9:46 Yes! Right to Repair means you can have your iPhone AND if it were to ever break you can get it repaired either by the manufacture or a licensed 3rd party repair shop that can own and operate the licensed tools needed to make the repairs!
does it come with tpm?
I'm surprised Louis Rossman didn't just show up and run off with it.
part of apple's billions of RND goes exactly into making as many components either proprietary or non-replaceable as possible.
RTX 3090 - Linus ahh that’s nothing   Laptop that cost half the price - Linus reeeeeeee
dude i hate windows precision drivers, but maaan that laptop looks sexy
I love it  :-D  This is probably my next laptop!
But more importantly, can I install a new GPU easily?
15:46 just watched someone from linus editing a video and he used to speed up the clips and you can see that someone made a mistake and left a little part of sped up clip in
I want this RIGHT NOW 😭❤️ Fuck apple and their anti right-to-repair lobbyists
Name of the laptop?
Looks like my next laptop.
Hopefully they will also come out with larger size laptops as well.
It's a coo-pon!
I'll get one if they're still around in a few years (and if I can put a RTX4080 or 5080 on it)
I pray for Framework to be successful with their product. I hope, their laptop design will become new standard for all laptops in the future.
Wow, actualy thinking about buying it
all that cash yet he hasn't got a activated windows 😂😂🤣
Shut up and take my money 💰🤑!
mmmm no the first was modu smart phone...
Alright if they make a gaming laptop, take my money
So refreshing, and those little thunderbolt dodaddies can even be used in other laptops as a dongle!
so this is basically lenovos lineup from the 2000's but in modern? i mean yeah count me in but the big minus for me is no ethernet port...
Lead the way Framework! ⭐🙂👍
i actually really want this
I love it! Modular DIY style laptop is the dream, really hope they can bring more modules and get it cheaper/competitive.
This is awesome!!
New Intro is fantastic..!
Linus’ “LOOK” at 7:54 was genuine
If they get AMD CPUs I'm getting one
Only issue I would have with this otherwise perfect laptop is that it doesn't have a default installed dedicated power input/usb-c port.  It would just make sense that you would always have a charging port on it.  Maybe you could charge it and then take out the extra usb-c, but it's still an extra hassle
The webcam is better than 99% laptops out there, regardless of pricing.
Damn, like that is freaking awesome. Just a shame that there so small to not offer European keyboard layouts. I would buy one ASAP.
the configarations are so cheep on their website
I lost it at the "cry me a river Linus" hahahah perfect comment for what i was thinking.
The packaging looks like it has pizza inside instead of a laptop
I have been on their website, and i feel it is a bit too much oriented for the techsavvy person still. If anyone from framework is reading, i suggest putting more emphasis on the prebuilt on the top of the page, with a button "customize your own" just under for the techy persons.  This is not only huge for geeks. This is huge for everyone that uses a laptop
This is so nice to see. If you ever saw an industrial controlled computer from the mid 80's - 90's everything was modular! The power supply was literately just the board screwed to the frame with the cables able to be swapped out in 30 seconds. It wasn't lego plug and play easy like today as you could plug something in incorrectly back then but it was just so nice to have modular EVERYTHING!
But can it run Crysis
Looks nice! Just to throw this out, Fair Phone does this for phones and also stresses about the supply chain as well seeing as that otherwise gets a little dodgy, tho they can't sell outside Europe
more like HDMBye
Oh my god... every ports it has are USB4,TB port...! you get 4 TB ports!
Louis Rossmann would love this laptop design. He might lose some business if it became super popularized, but he'd definitely respect the idea of self-repair.
i dont need a laptop, but this is the first time ive ever been tempted. really hope this succeeds
It shall die like Phoneblocks for predatory capitalism must not forgive.
Very cool. Hopefully in the future they make larger ones that'll let you have dedicated graphics and more I/O!
The amount of youtube videos that got me an "instabuy" need can be counted on the hand of a mechanic that doesn't know how to keep his finger away from spinning machinery... And this is one of them. This product makes so much sense i'm almost outraged no one did it before
found my next toy thank you LINUS!
FINALLY!!! Someone is going after Apple's lunch!
Wait, goodix and linux support?
TLDW: [Everyone Liked That]
I want one so bad, would love to see what other modules they come out with, and it would be cool if they let third parties develop modules as well.
I'm very interested.
5:50 The expansion cards on the Framework Laptop interface over USB4, not USB3.2 While the USB-A and Storage expansion cards only support USB3.2, the actual interface on the laptop side is USB4 and can be used with the USB-C card.
No GPU?
It would be awesome to see something like this with a solid gpu in it as well! It might be a while for that though.
If they offer a bigger version with a full keyboard until a need a new laptop, I would consider to buy buy it.
iFixit gave this system a 10 for repairability. Only two other laptops have ever gotten that score: the HP EliteBook 800 series (versions from various years, the most recent one scored is a 2020 model) and the Dell Latitude E5270 from 2017. Those are both enterprise laptops. No consumer laptop has ever before been given a 10 by them.  And honestly... if this is a 10, nothing before it is better than a 9. Even the motherboard and the CPU cooler are dead simple to replace. (Watch the iFixit teardown video.) Those I/O modules mean that the I/O ports on the motherboard are not vulnerable to physical damage. You only need to disconnect one ribbon cable to open it up; the keyboard and trackpad cables are combined. The magnetic bezel around the display won't break when removed, unlike the plastic tabs that are so common. And you only need ONE tool to take it completely apart; every screw is a Torx T5 or a Phillips P0, and the tool has a reverseable bit.  Right now this is looking like the gold standard of how laptops should be designed. The only question that remains is how well it will stand up to years of use.
Man, if they did ARM chips that are as good as apple's M1, this thing could destroy the market! I mean, it has a pretty good chance of doing that anyway
Linus almost dropped something, check. Linus did drop something, check.
Everything about this laptop is surprisingly heartwarming
Can you do some performance tests? so I know what I would expect out of the hardware. Look great tho
Framework seems like it worth supporting.
I'll buy one in a year or two since that is when I'll get a new laptop.
Once I have money, I’m gonna order one
hope they can add an gpu in the future
nothing special to say, just here to feed the algorithm because I really want this company to succeed
Louis Rossman has entered the chat....  <Heavy breathing>
Pretty expensive for the ability to upgrade.
what about thermal performance?
Its not about if it could be made, its about how full of shit all those other companies are to make wastefull product that could easely be repairable saving a ton of ressources and CO2 emissions in the process, just because muh profit margin and investors pressure on positive returns  I blame investors for 50% of that issue, company 50% for beign jus tgreedy and the entire problem 100% on pure greed
Volta spark 60w for charging maybe? USB C and Magnetic!  and fuck yea I support this 100%! I don't need a new laptop atm, but when I need one I hope I can get something like this! Shut up and take My Money!
Can you play video games on it?
The automatic knight modestly whirl because judo naturally kick than a available softball. flowery, cultured lawyer
Will there be 3rd party modules? Otherwise we are stuck with the company ones...
I feel whoever can, should buy this laptop, like if you have money to buy crypto, buy this laptop, its a different kind of investment, we are investing in future where everybody tries to copy them after looking at their sales.
I most definitely want one. Hopefully they'll be available in the UK/Europe soon... 🤞🏻
Is it coming with linux, at least as an option to install it by manufacturer?  Fist, before id buy: They have to ship to the Netherlands. AMD, and full linux support (although, when you said power button and fingerprint reader comes with full linux support, iwas already wow, like it!), but that RISC-V option really a sweet option what would be lovely to have and play with!
I'd love to see a dual USB-C module because it looks very doable.
sweet.want one
This will definitely be my next laptop. Everything about this is just future worth.  F*ck apple and the other companies who deliberately design product you can not repair. Look at this! Why cant the world be a beter place where everybody designs there products this way
So this laptop is made by a company that doesn't want to squeeze every penny they can?! Sign me up, I've been looking for a computer. Framework, where have you been for my 15 years alive
If only the Steam Deck has something like this!.
Oh gawd.  I'd love for this to get to the EU market. Would absolutely get one of these as a work PC.
I am actually going to be in the market for a new laptop soon. This one just made my very very short list to consider. For me it all comes down to a choice between: A MacBook of some type, Dell XPS, Another Asus Zenbook (Which I currently use), The Lenovo X1 Carbon, and now this one...
I'm sold!!
In the perfect work this would be the new standard and this company would be wildly successful. I hope we are close to that world
Why is the douchie kid wearing a mask? I guess he buys into the Big Pharma perpetuated lies? Please investigate!
This is the awesomest laptop I've seen in years... and the only one I'd actually want to buy.
Man, this is pure fire
After every sentence, I trying to think he's not being sponsored by that company, It's so haaaard
If only the GPU can be upgraded....
Linus with this video probably sold more laptops than during his entire career at NCIX.
Sad to see yet another amazing laptop with no integrated WWAN options.
They need to ship to the U.K. I really want one
gotta get one for christmas!
honestly the headphone jack needs to be modular. It's the one thing that has broken in almost every laptop I've ever had. Other than that it's pretty awesome.
Hmmmm.... dongles... but inside..... they would never notice that
The normal bangladesh ultrastructurally develop because author aerobically bow sans a defective nut. low, erratic lobster
Still a way to go imo , no socketed CPU/GPU . Though a step in the right direction . Also a hot swap battery would have been good
Nice to see Linus is still dropping things 😂
I always thought that miniaturization of silicon and tight integration should've resulted in MORE modularity, not less. And here you have it, look those miniature tightly-integrated modules.
17:29 Wow LTT, Get your windows activated men..
Noticed they don't have a full size SD card slot... Yet. I'll look into making one myself
Surprised you didn't bring up the Apple Pismo, you could replace the dvdr with a battery pack (i think it could even take 2 battery packs in its 2 modular slots), I forget what could be slotted, i believe a floppy drive 1 side, cd/dvd drive the other if at home and not using a battery - no doubt there were other replaceable slots but the fact you could buy a replaceable "something" was cool. & I'm looking at an old Apple Pismo  as i type sat on my display shelves.... not quite an modular but close :) (i hate apple - even though it works, going to gut it and raspberry pi it.
This is sooooooooooooooo fliping Cool
Where can I buy this shit ?
Apple be like: yea lets not even bother putting screws on and just glue it shut, cause ur not getting into it anyway...buy a new 1
I'm buying an AMD one with a touch screen when they make it
Am I the only one that thinks this is dumb? I’m fine with using an external USB-C dongle. Instead of one that’s flush with the computer. Just unnecessary  To be clear, I’m talking about the big selling point of “modularity” or the laptop, especially the ports. The repairability I think is great
oh man, if i get this running Debian on RISC-V, wet dream
this type of tech should be obligatory worldwide, I'm from brazil and I'm already crying for not being able to get one right now
Everyone quickly purchase, so every company is FORCED to adapt
Whats the graphics card specs ??
4:17 sorry Linus, there is no philosophical difference 😂
This is AMAZING!! And now that Right to repair is coming along, I think we are heading to right direction!!
I cannot find the cad drawing, someone that have found it?
Holy shit. Even as a long-time Thinkpad nerd, I think I've found my next laptop.
I hope the devs won't get shot 🙏
I wish my employers would buy this. This laptop would make our repairs or upgrade wishes at our customers so much easier.
They sent you some options that aren't available to the public yet like that clear keyboard. But I'm sure they will be available soon enough.  I ordered the low end prebuilt configuration rather than a DIY because it ends up being a bit cheaper than buying the parts and OS separately. You still get to choose the USB modules. The price premium for the 1165 configuration wasn't worth it for me, and the 1185 option seems overpriced, period.  I'm not actually going to run it with only 8 GB of RAM; I don't want a Windows system with that little memory in 2021. I will move the 32 GB (2x16 GB) over from my current laptop (which I plan to retire and sell), and use the 8 GB from the Framework along with a second stick that I already have when I configure the old one for sale.  You do give up a LITTLE with this. The size and weight are comparable to an XPS, but it's not as thin and light as an LG Gram. (It CAN'T be as thin; there would be no room for the memory and storage sockets.) I'll take that to get a laptop I can upgrade and repair. And if you opt for Windows you get an install with ZERO bloatware; I don't believe they have changed anything other than a theme and wallpaper.  I'm looking forward to seeing whether the build quality lives up to the reviews. They certainly don't appear to have cheaped out on the components; you're getting quality RAM, storage, WiFi, keyboard, etc. It's priced as a premium laptop (comparable to an XPS or the like) so that is as it should be; this class of machine should not have hidden compromises like an SSD that wears out quickly. Mine is supposed to ship this week!
Can you advise, my laptop is a Dell i7 5559 with ddr3l 8gb (4X2), I want to upgrade to 16gb(8X2), in Sri Lanka AITC is available at a reasonable price, how is this brand do you have experience in using this brand,
I pray to god that this takes off.. What an amazing approach.
I can't think of any reason why Apple, Acer, Dell, Samsung, or any other laptop manufacturer couldn't make a machine like this.
this pos has no graphics card options ,$1600 aud for the cheaper option with 8 gb ram,?? cpu upgrades ????  .. sounds like a scam to me
This is literally frickin amazing, they really have gone the full mile on this laptop
Can’t wait for them to land in the UK 🇬🇧, I’m on the lookout for a new laptop, and this would be ideal!
WHAAT YESSS @9:00 Framework this is epic!
This company reminds me of discord
It's not a Linus video unless something gets dropped...
That laptop's camera quality is even better than Pewd's camera
God: How much do you want to have Linus simp for you?  Framework: Yes.
Where can I invest? This needs to go viral.
If this comes in at the right price point I can't wait to throw my money at it
This is incredible!
Listen, I love the idea, just how I loved the idea of the whatsitcalled modular smartphone back when, but unless somebody major joins the bandwagon, I don't see the difference between a laptop I can't upgrade and one I _could_ upgrade if replacement parts were still available, but whoops, the small startup that created them went out of business and their sleek modules aren't manufactured anymore.  Like, just as an example, the first smart watch I bought was the Sony SW50, and it had a terrible (imho) silicone wrist strap. I thought, well, no worries, there's a replacement adapter that makes it compatible with standard 24mm straps, but oooh, it's like $60 right now, I think I'll wait until my current one bites the dust before I replace it. Well, about two years later the silicone tore, I went online and... Sony had discontinued the watch, like you couldn't even find it on their products page anymore, and that neat little adapter sold for +$100 on ebay, second-hand. Fucking infuriating.  I'm not speaking about the core components like RAM or the M.2 drives, huge kudos to them for sticking with widely available components there, but the cute little plug-in cards, the keyboard and trackpad (unless Lidon and PixArt just have that form factor ready to go)... I understand that you can't make _everything_ modular and standardized, especially in a laptop, and maybe I am just too coddled by desktop PCs where I can swap basically any peripherals without even opening the case.  I _want_ to love this, both the idea and the execution, but I've been burned by the promise of "nah, don't worry if something gives up the ghost, you can fix it" and then once it's time to fix something, like, four years down the line, I'll be on ebay again scavenging for broken donor devices to rip parts from. Y'know, like we're repairing current gen laptops. I'm more than happy to change my mind in the future, don't get me wrong, it's just hard to trust somebody who promises me they have the solution when everybody before them broke that exact promise.
i want to buy one of these just to support this company...because damn this is a great great thing to see.  keep it up!
Man. This really is amazing. I hope this takes off in a huge way. Please. Please
Years ago this was an idea with cell phones aswell, but that didnt work at all. :)
this is how I've pictured an ideal laptop for several years (except for the motherboard and CPU being tied together but ig that's a small price to pay for salvation)
However the laptop is absolutely amazing
Hey windows is not activated😕😕😕
apple OS is gonna have a blast being installed in these
Technology: New device with unique connection! Get your new computer now! Framework: Hold my beer.
This is like a portable desktop because it's upgradable
Amazing
This thing is crazy. I have stopped using laptops altogether since about 2010/2011, just because repairs were a mess and I hated throwing them away every time something broke - but this device is a laptop I'd consider buying again.
Thanks for showing this off - I will definitely be getting one soon.
I need do dad majigs
The sad thing is that your laptop is obsolete within the year ie 12 months and is no longer supported , laptops are more frequent then graphic card releases , good luck upgrading this thing after 12 months , the only standards are ram sockets and sata/m.2 sockets .
"I'm doin it." And i guess like thousands of LTT fans are doing it too. Good job framework, this is great 👍
Still using a note9 eh,good man.
Damn this  is exciting.   I may be in the market for a new laptop in the coming months when I start my PhD. Really hoping I can get this with my equipment budget
This genuinely looks to be a fantastic product and I will actually be looking to get one when I need to replace my laptop in the not to distant future.   I'd be really interested to see them attempt to take on a gaming Laptop because by the look of this laptop, they'd be setting a new bar for gaming laptops with decent upgradability, which could also make gaming laptops significantly more affordable as a long term device where you could choose to upgrade the GPU rather than buy an entire system!
naaah, I'm good
Tim Cook is not amused.
15:44 apple, microsoft want to know your address Linus 😛
If only it had modular dGPUs
great
Most exciting ltt video ever ……
WOW, Something That You Can Buy Online, Thats In A Shop Window, Is Now For Sale To The General Public, Next You Will Be Telling Me That Snowden Leaked Secrets Too Wikileaks,to inform the world , That Are Not Secrets, Because The Intelligence services have been doing that Elizabethan Times. GO FIGURE.
Strangely love how this video is edited. Snappy and caffeinated!
Still deep fake Linus what's this   I know that by u never dropped stuff I need linus
My 15 year old broken laptop that has like 20-40 screws and takes a whole evening to disassemble and assemble: huh
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙏🏾🤘🏾
"Damn it."? Really, it fell and so you say a wish for God to damn it??? Makes no sense.
The webcam is better than macbooks at 1080p lol
I am very happy you corvered this positively, that gives me more hope that they can actually take off
Says something from 2010 and shows something from 1993.
Wait… So, I don't have to be stuck with this loose/broken USB port anymore? I can just buy a new module and swap it out? Sign me up, quickly!
That face camera is really good
needs AMD cpu options, but if I ever need to buy a laptop this is going to be my first choice!
My God this is so beautiful. Why have big tech companies not done this?
Thinkpads used to be this way, but not as slim. Thanks God there's a company to carry on this path.
Why is it so hard to tell whether hes praising or sarcastically belittling something? 😂😂
As for wireless charging, it it truly wireless charging if the modular part is not wireless? Is it not just a part of the charger that is wireless :P This probably will not stand in court though.
They're hiring you say !?
What about the graphics card?
Implying Apple doesn't make their systems unrepairable on purpose so that you have to go through them with their huge markups. It's a scam that people still fall for.
Damn
This is one of the crazy products featured on this channel I'll actually buy
Lots of laptops have a white list of compatible wifi modules, flashed into the bios
18 minutes and 45 seconds ad for framework...  Kudos to the dev team and hopefully we see more of this in the future.... in the meantime, i'll stick to my satechi expansion.....or 5 of them..... *cries in dongles*
Considering their website says they're going to have a platform to buy all sorts of important replacement parts (hinges, displays, etc.), I am extremely stoked. Anything to get me away from the cursed e-bay replacement part listings.
This is excellent
I hope this succeeds and other vendors follow suit. I wouldn't purchase this particular model since anything I would want needs to have at least an 8gb nvidia x70 GPU, but this does look rather optimistic.
As an onsite engineer that repairs Dells, alienwares, Lenovo's and HPs in the field everyday I am super impressed with this thing! It is so well thought out! Many times I just facepalm about some of the design decisions made by these other companies.  That being said, what future plans do they have for GPU modularity? Obviously, the only way that will work is they would either have to start their own gpu company or get amd and/or nvidia to work with them on a gpu design. Oh man, if these guys could get with lightmatter to design a modular GPU for this thing! Omg!   In any case, this is still awesome!
For those wondering about the price: $749 lowest model with empty expansion slots and no OS. Mid level is about $1500. All the bells and whistles around $2000. Plus tax.
If I needed a laptop I‘d definitely consider them. I have one from my workplace and they are probably not going too switch.
Now i want a gaming version of this.
Shut up and take my money!
Which anime ?  17:36
i am also using my 2.5 year old samsung note 9....
In the NVMe slot, does it look like there's enough clearance for an SN850 with a heatsink?
11:30 Take my like and leave!!!
Actual exiting product.
We have beeeeeeen waiting for this!
For anyone interested in upgradeable laptops of the past, the Lenovo T440p offers also CPU upgrades. A very nice layout, unfortunately old, a bit beefy but it was great value when bought used.
🤩😍 this excitement is positively infectious, but please stop flailing the laptop about. please. it hurts me. deep. deep in my soul. /-d:-)
i hope this is going to be the future of laptops. also imagine just being able to donate used modules after upgrading, so they don't go to waste if they are still useable. this could be such a big W to sustainability
More of this. Fuck apple
Where is the GPU?
did it come with a windows license?
I am pumped. I may have missed it, what OS does it ship with? Does it support all OS's?
youtube getting real comfortable with these unskippable ads
sweet computer!
I'm buying.
I want them to become number 1. I am buying this laptop.
I was about to get it until I realized I cant get a GPU with it.
It's like the company decided to make a brand based around right to repair and it's beautiful
They should launch this in developing countries these will be instant hot cakes. People don't have the money to buy new laptops every 2 years so this will help to stay update.
Other YouTubers have studio for videos Linus: I have a kitchen. Duh!!!
Can you upgrade the cpu?? that is the big question.
8:19 Linus drop testing the expansion cards.
well i just found the next laptop im buying. Also apparently on their website in the configurations they have an faq about cpu upgrades. apparently they plan on making main boards with different CPUs into the future so you can just swap the board. WTF
How well does it Linux is what I wanna know...
This is literally laptop that I dreaming about 5 years ago 🤓
Car manufacturers need to be forced to adopt this approach. Battery operated tools as well. And Apple, John Deere etc...can ALL suck it.  Greedy bastards attempting to kill Right to Repair can ALL drill holes in their kneecaps. Stay gold.
If Framework's gonna be around in 5 years (hopefully going strong) this will be our future. Who doesn't want to customize, service and upgrade while also having a lower impact on the environment?
Completely?  Am I missing something more than just modular ports?  I think that a full complements of ports built in at the start would be cheaper and more effective path.  (Need to modify a port in the future?  Buy a dongle.  But since laptops are typically replaced more often than desktops, I suspect that few would need to do that.)
2256x1504 da hecc kind of res is that
So now i just wait for then to have a 5800U in their lineup and buy one.  This product is honestly simply amazing.
Welp ... guess I found my new laptop ...!
If they have a version with Ryzen and an rtx 30 series I want it
I know where i am buying my next computer
Baller Laptop! Hands Down Awesomeness! I wish I needed one! I'm a desktop guy.
this is how you innovate Apple, I hope you learned something.
This is awesome. I want one. Gonna have to wait tho haha
seeing Linus manipulate the opened laptop in berzerker hype mode made me uneasy >< thriller movies made in 2021 wish they could do that
10 hours into my 8 hour workday and this video had me cracking up. Subscribed instantly.
Hey can we upgrade the graphics card in this one?
I see this company is taking sort of the same route like Panasonics ToughBook 55 as Linus reviewed it a year and a bit ago
i'll wait for a Ryzen processor, but i'm sold.
@Framework Are there Linux drivers for all the components?  Specifically power button / fingerprint reader has me worried. E. G. On my HP EliteBook 840 G3 I've got an unusable fingerprint reader - no drivers for Linux available - and even if i wanted to write one myself, the company making them does not hand out specs needed to make a driver so you literally have to reverse engineer the entire device...
If it was running Mac OS I'd seriously consider getting one.👍
modular systems is hopefully the next step in consumer tech products
Framework should advertise you on their website considering you did a review for them
I hope this company survives long enough to release a 15" with a 3-button touchpad, numeric keypad, and gaming GPU.
No discrete graphics card for $800+ for a basic Intel i5-1135G7? No thanks. I'll stick with my Asus/MSI laptops personally.
this is the ikea of laptops
I just bought a laptop this year ..... And am probably going to buy this specifically to support them.
a great change towards sustainable future. Also effective use of natural resources.
15:15 that is GREAT 1080p video, crisp, without any grain at all.  VERY IMPRESSED.
I am bummed there is only a 13.3” model but I am STOKED about this computer so much that I may just order one or two anyway just to support this FRICKIN amazing right to repair centered machine and company.
Would this be linus's daily driver?
urghhh the keys
Like omg! I’ve never been an impulse buyer, but so just ordered one!
they dont want people to keep the laptops and upgrade them, they want to buy a new 5000$ ones since those arent even worth 1k$, i dont want a big battery for my laptop, i dont use it for the battery, that battery its good in case of power outage. i dont like that it doesnt have a numpad
I was considering to buy a new laptop. Thank you linus for saving my time. I am buying this one.
THIS IS AMAZING! Modularity rullleezzzzz. Can't wait next gen modularity in PCs
Is the chasis all aluminium?
I would love to have a Framework laptop, even one with a bit bulkier body frame too, so it would have more space for upgrades, slots, you name it. It could be the "Big Brother" version of it, with not much difference, maybe just the frame with nothing in it, then even the motherboard is install-required; and it is with a full sized- ten-keyed keyboard, that can have its numpad replaced even with more storage maybe. But also, with more space would come more slot space too [like 3 additional monitor HDMI-DISPLAYPORT if the "replaceable" GPU  is good enough to support it] or just more fans to keep it cool.... so many possibilities!    [As for the form factor, my main source is an ASUS ROG GLVE series laptop,  or wouldn't even mind a bigger one, if it comes with a bigger display - like a 17 inch plus ]
I'm sold. daaang
Me: Ok, I love this. I'm sold.    Me: Remembers wallet.
I will certainly be interested in this once the option of a thicker model with a dedicated GPU is released.
WTF; Micro Center CANNOT SHIP TO CANADA!
Me who's wondering if I could get a job with them   Also me being a literal child
I’d like to see if they can do a gaming laptop with all these modular upgrades. That would be cool
This laptop is dream tier.
Wish it was available with amd
Man, you can almost see Linus' drool hitting the floor.  Granted, it's deserved but wow he really fanboyed out over the laptop.
Oooohhhhhh this is what may literally make things awesome...and Support us folks who Want to learn ( more ) instead of getting some other hobby
Now THAT'S what I'm talkin' 'bout!  If they are successful enough, perhaps they'll make a gaming laptop with this design philosophy down the road.  I think they could still just solder a CPU interface to a mobile CPU if they really wanted. Though, that would cost a bit of thickness. They probably thought of this and weighted the pros and cons, now that I think of it.  Besides... If you can take the included motherboard OUT... You can put a new motherboard IN, with an updated CPU attached.
i love the plugin drive idea, having one for a games library one for movies etc.. a handful of those things in a backpack is unnoticeable, personally i allready have a bunch of usb drives anyway.
Big billionaire companies are not our friends, that's why.
not too far in the future.... (insert Tech Giants Company names) just announce the acquisition of Framework for $ (insert the amount of money) millions dollars
This would be huge in the corporate world where users break shit all the time and the poor IT department have to fix it....
Linus bought a product he recommended immediately; damn
You should cover the freedomphone
Actually how much does it cost
Just a shame it’s not in black
This, gentlemen of honour is the electronics equivalent of a transformation from " Don't drink the contents of the battery" to "How to adjust the valve clearance of your new 'whatever model car you just bought'."
I just want a bigger screen version. I love 17 inch laptop screens.
Offer an AMD and I'm down
Man I would have been even more interested if they included the newer AMD apus; that would have made it the best contender for what I would want personally.
Hopefully specs will increase over time if they survive.  It would be an absolute hit in the gaming community if they are able to offer systems comparable to ones like the ROG Zephyrus G14 or G15 in the future.  This would be an opportunity to make, not only the first fully configurable and upgradable laptop, but also the first to fully support an external graphics accelerator.   Just that last part alone would be a potential game changer, (literally)😁
I hope they get a very high nits screen option (like 600+ nits) so I can use it to work outside. Those usually only come with very premium devices (and I don't wan't to pay for a lot of those premium features, e.g. a 4k webcam).
Here's a comment for the algo. recommend away! Not that linusTT needs the algo to push their videos any more. I literally unsubscribed because they recommended too many videos and i still get plenty of videos pushed to me.
i can see that it comes included with Iris Xe Graphics card, but hard to find info on how good that is, can you comment on the gaming ability of this laptop?
This pisses me off. I talked about this idea years ago, but lack the funding to do it The rich get richer...
Only criticism, and it's a very small one... offer blank modules, so if you don't need/want to fill all 4 with something, you can just cover it up. But given the price, you could easily get at least 4. I just did a quick browse, and could go 2x Type C, 1x Type A and a HDMI. An ethernet one would be nice, but I think even the low profile jacks are too thick for the module.
It just sucks that my keyboard layout does not exist yet. Hoping its added before I'm required to get a laptop for college
Shit if I hadn't just gotten a desktop replacement kinda laptop....might look into one of these anyway as an *actually portable* one
me: drops pc  pc: shatters like a dropped lego death star
I would be very surprised if he has not invested in a gym mat to break the fall of everything dropped on this channel.
The excitement on Linus's face is just priceless 👨‍💻
changing out s3 virge 4mb with a rtx 4090(6) 48-96gb gpu.
ha, simp
Linus Drop Tips :)
AMD CPU + Linux Support and I am on
This laptop can prove market disrupting
I would pay 100 USD per year to make sure the company lives well and they are happily paid. That’s 100 USD x 15k buyers from Linus + same from Louis Rossman = 30k buyers x 100 USD each a year = 3.000.000 USD just to keep the company alive. That could pay 20 engineers or so.
very glossy no matte screen option... end of story.
They're counting on the DLC and micro purchases
4 minutes in and I already LOVE this thing! *SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!*
That laptop is soo dope!!
The activate windows at the bottom lol
I'm fkin sold
They should add Mobo(with CPU) replacement and GPU replacement on the back with quick slots. That laptop is really NextGen Laptop. I hope thwy will grow up and build even better stuff.
You can’t change the graphics card ?
Amazing stuff. And rather affordable too.
When time comes that the display or motherboard will be broken, can we buy those individual parts? There would also be a time that we might want to buy only the expansions. Hope soon, there will be a way to upgrade the mobo/proc
Lol @530 wasn't the prototype stolen when it was shown off or was that the triple screen labtop that went "Missing"
More Laptops need to be like this. Hell, I'm sure there are Some Desktops out there that could stand to be more like this, too!
Dbrand that shiz!!
what graphic card does it use? and does the graphic card upgradeable too?
We are so close, now all we need is an upgradeable gaming laptop
I am still waiting for project christine🙄
I second Louis Rossmann about trackpoint support. Please... Also some kind of external GPU support btw :)
9:48 - "I'm not telling you you can't have an iphone...I'm saying there should be an alternative." (sic) _Mac People will not understand this statement.  You have insulted their God._
i want it
This is clever, you are going to keep spending money with the same company. If you buy a Dell for example your next PC can be HP, Asus, Lenovo etc.
_But how are we supposed to sell our repair plans if the end user can just repair it themselves?!_
Linus in a Microcenter, dont know that ive seen that before
this is freaking awesome! To put the manual as a QR code on the component is genius yet so easy. Totally wondering, why it isn't common practice in the first place.
consumers are constantly dying for companies to make products that dont assume they are complete dumbasses.  this company will succeed because theyre fulfilling that market.
Lol, it's more ThinkPad than a new ThinkPad!
but do microcenter got that framework laptops tho? i think not!
Apple : This should not exist
I was really waiting for a catch or sompromise or something but it just seems so good if the company takes off this changes the game rip Dell apple hp Lenovo and all the rest
15:20 is why I like Linus... the love of tech devices, without giving an f- about authoritative edicts
is it only me that likes bulky and chunkier laptop.. imagine it is upgradable u can push so much higher spec on the chunkier one.
No video card or cpu  upgrade>? not interested,nothing special about it honestly to reflect the price they ask for it and the  modules,when the most important in a laptop  it s the  dedicated video card and CPU .
If GPU also comes up, I'll readily buy this
eGPU?
I have more faith in this than any of the modular designs big companies put out, because this company literally only tries to pitch this philosophy.  The entire company is measured by them living up to this promise unlike Dell and others where it's more like... "Yeah, we have something modular. Maybe we even ship stuff for this a year later. Who knows. If you're unsure, we always have a nice portfolio to sell to you afterwards or right now if you prefer! *wink*"  This is awesome.
That's my next laptop.
Can we get "Cry me a river Linus" t-shirts made...
I don't use laptops, I just don't have a personal or professional need for them. If I did, this sucker has all the boxes checked for something that's repairable, durable, upgradeable and DIFFERENT.
I've ever looked at a laptop before and though "I think I'm in love". Framework has completely changed my mind. I am absolutely in love with this thing.
They release a new gamer model for my next laptop in a few years, I will give them serious mind share. But I do not need this type of lappie, but so cool nonetheless.
i thought that this was apple for a second but there is no way in hell they would do somthing this creative and consumer friendly
This is awsome kinda wish I wouldn't have just bought a laptop
pls put this on shelf in china!!
I will absolutely give it a go as my next laptop! Amazing tech by framework and everyone who are involved! Also would like see/hear few months of usage review from Linus. Awesome, awesome and awesome!
Well if I need a new laptop I know what I’m getting, this absolutely needs to be an industry standard.
Anyone eyeing this and wondering if it could be a Thinkpad/MacBook killer?
Imagine not paying for anti-support!?  Hasn't everyone been thinking the same thing, but gave up hope because the competition is so large?  I took apart a macbook pro from 2013, and I was impressed.  Got me thinking.. oh cool, I can just order up one!  yet without the fruity anti-support.
I'd love to see that thing get a touchscreen and 360 degree hinge
I'd hazard a guess that Apple spends its billions on marketing and lobbying rather than R&D.
Another cool thing that you should have mentioned is that you can use probable these "Expansion Cards" on any USB-c device, so you could probably plug most of the things into your phone as well, right? That makes an incredibly neat product even neater.
so cool
This is absolutely amazing. The fact that they designed the motherboard to be able to work outside of the device just blew my mind. I really hope this repeatable design philosophy will take off.
I doubt that Disconnect Battery was for using it that way though. Isn't it a service option that disconnects the battery for service, and until you plug in AC adapter?
Being as rich as Linus, and with access to so many new gadgets it's nice to see he's still rocking his trusty Note9, even though it's shattered to pieces.
Finally, a fun looking laptop
Hopefully this product succeeds enough to expand globally, cause im pretty pessimistic with this going to my region
If there's a Ryzen version, I'm sold.
What the frick is that mechanical keyboard
no GPU tho?
There is no $300 savings for the DIY version. Once you add RAM, SSD and wifi, it costs more or less the same as the preconfigured ones.
I waited so long for this video lol. Don't know about their Sales, but I wouldn't be surprised if they raise money at an valuation of 100m+ I am just waiting for the European launch
*This. This should be the future.*  Make it 15" and add a dedicated GPU and I would buy it in a heartbeat.
8:21 Can you change this slots while the laptop is running? Or do you need to restart for it to realize it's now a HDMI and not an USB-A anymore?
Too bad its not suitable for hardcore gaming. Other than that, easily the most impressive kind of laptop. I still won't buy a laptop. I have no use for it. But thid would certainly one of the most interesting concept. Always hated how hard laptops are to deal with when trying to upgrade or repair or clean.
Let's make repairability fashionable. Thanks Linus!
Of course apple and other companies dont make stuff like this. Doesnt make as much money.
I have a Dell e1705 and I was able to upgrade the cpu, gpu, ram, disk drive, and eth card. Dell provided a full pdf with clickable links to guide you through changing any component. This was 10 years ago though.
can we add a graphic caard??
I havent seen Linus be passionate about a new product in quite a while.
Wow a laptop that desktop user can appreciate
Ah only english version, sadlife. Want one but need qwertz Keyboard layout :/
Pfft "fully repairable" but the parts are all from CHINA....
It's really disappointing that Apple, HP, Gateway, etc. will all somehow run these guys out of business, take the idea, water it down, and dump it into a $2,500 "enthusiast" laptop.
i love how Linus still uses the Note 9 - such a complete device
This is really cool, I hope it sends out a message to people that even complex things can be build in a repairable way. Which hopefully should, in turn, force more prominent manufacturers to apply these practices.
Wow what a good idea, executed so well. Definitely can sense the passion that went into this design, sourcing the switches and keys etc from long known reputable OEMs. Just awesome. Maybe might make some big companies shift their ways a bit, hopefully.
As a Thinkpad refurbisher this is amazing to me. Though, it seems a bit pricey.
I want one. So bad. I hope they're still going strong when my current laptop dies - I'm so fucking sick of disposable tech!! Next phone's going to be a Fairphone, too.
It is funny that I still have Samsung 900X3C from 2012... and I regularly use it when on the go because it is ultra slim/ultra portable device and it has almost all the same upgradability. Yes you can fit M-Sata driver (times before m.2), you can fit new wireless card... the ram is sadly soldered on, but it is ultra-slim laptop (and you can have 15" still ultra slim 900X4D which has upgradable ram). I have recently replaced the battery on my girlfriends laptop (she has similar 900X3E model) as there are no glue or crap on these laptops. And it is still fully usable laptop - she used it for studies and playing LOL, SC2 and many older games. I have upgraded to 512GB SSD from 128GB in mine. So there are ways of upgrading these things. The only thing which is glued is the bezel around the screen, but the screen itself is just screwed on. I have seen replacement screens and they simply come with new bezel which you can stick-on. In short, the only waste generated by replacing screen is slim piece of screen bezel (no more aluminium than in single can of coke!). One thing I wish somebody would do is the new motherboards... Imagine how awesome it would be if I could take this gorgeous ultra-slim alloy laptop from 2012 and replace crappy i7 3517U/Intel HD4000 graphics with something like Ryzen 7 5800U! Consider this - old CPU was W17TDP part, the new Ryzen is W15-25TDP part so not only it is more efficient and would make battery life better (which was not that bad to begin with ~6h when new and still get's me 2-3h today), but it is like 10 times faster on all tasks. And I would like to note that fan on this laptop isn't even running all the time - if just browsing the internet it doesn't even spin... so I would speculate Ryzen could be cranked all the way to W25TDP and existing cooling in the laptop would still be able to cope. So... the key problem is that upgrade parts are never made. If somebody would take new MB for my 9 years old laptop, it was made in a way that it could be upgraded and because of advancement in efficiency I can increase it's power like 10x and still manage the TDP within what is ultra-slim laptop. https://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Update-Samsung-Series-9-900X3C-A04DE-Subnotebook.83079.0.html In summary, the claim that you cannot tightly integrate laptop and make it desirable is bullshit. If Samsung managed to make this ultra-slim allow laptop without using any glue in 2012, then it is possible to do. The FLEX... there is NONE - it is precisely machined aircraft grade aluminium unibody - it is as solid as solid piece of aluminium alloy could be. One other thing - the way Samsung designed it doesn't require unplugging any flex cables before you can start upgrading (and these could fail over time), meaning that Samsung implementation is even better and potentially could withstand much more times being opened. I am even getting questions (of what it is) and compliments how stylish it looks even 9 years since it was made.
i love the idea of the swaping of the ports you can run on the side, as a network engineer im foreced to work off a company issued dell latitude 7400 which is missing one KEY components for my job, a network port, there webesite isnt showing that as a port option yet but i hope they bring one in, i miss having a network port to be able to plug directly into things when im working in a datacenter with zero wifi.
jokes on you i upgraded my laptop to 970M from 860M.  edit: the gpu cost 150 dollar because its rare and use MXM connector but it was worth it.
Love to know what Louis Rossmann thinks of this 😁
Amazing concept, very supportable. But sadly, it’s way out of my price range. Even if they made an i3 version, I simply cannot afford the premium they’re asking anytime near.  For 1 grand, you’re either in i7/Ryzen 7, or GTX 16xx/RTX 2060 territory.
The philosophy behind the product is great but the price is just ridiculous. How do these companies think they will survive as new players in the space marketing to only people with over a grand to blow on a laptop?!? How hard would it have been for them to have a similarly configurable mid/low end cost sku for the rest of the world so they can actually grow to a size where they can show this type of product is viable.
So Linus finally broke his Note 9. Way to go Linus!
About time, sadly by the time it gets to be sold over here, it'll be a few years and way more expensive. Not sure about Canada, but USA for tech, normally half the price compared to Europe.
Wow this is great news. Less E-waste! Thank you Linus group for this tip/video.
Delighted that they chose a 3:2 display (shame there are no 4:3 ones at the moment). Looks great, will likely order one once they start shipping to the UK.
A shame they don't ship the prebuilt with Linux or at least without Windows, but other than that, pretty awesome product!
All i can say is RESPECT. As an ex pc builder for the* biggest retailer.. i can see quality there. Well done that you've used your brain making this laptop. 🤞🤟🤞
This is a huge step in the right direction. If this thing had a trackpoint I would marry it xD
13 m subs and still does videos in kitchen  . Lol.  Get a studio please /s
I love the concept. Unfortunately, it looks like they currently only support Intel mobile cpus. A suggestion, if it's possible, please provide mobile AMD Ryzen APU support in the future and you will have a customer!
Nice now i gotta pay 1000$ instead of 300$ :)
Back in the days when you could go on NCIX and buy a barebones laptop with a cpu socket.
The average traffic neurobiologically double because hardboard usually apologise regarding a peaceful whale. pathetic, stingy volcano
I just bought a new laptop a few months ago and now i'm wishing i had waited to get this one instead!! Love the concept and philosophy of this brand, reducing ewaste and improving the consumer experience, couldnt ask for any better!
MXM GPU slot would be nice addiction to overall upgrade potential. Also sad that DELL dropped such approach to their products (I have M6600 that's highly configurable and upgradable, but it's pretty old already)
so my knowledge is a little old but i used to repair dell Laptops as well as lenovo/IBMs in australia, haven't since around 2012 i found Dell Laptops  easy to work on, came apart very logically and only 2 maybe 3 different types of screws warranty was excellent sometimes covering device couple of months out of warranty, plus would find myself at a school and then a resident the next day was not just support for corporations really good support i could chuck the dell asset tag into a website and i would tel me what the system type  any upgraded ETC aswell as bios upgrades that were so simple to run. they didn't market modular but i don't remember anything being glued in Rarely ever needed to support love them working on them would happily go fix a dell any day of the week. i would question the quality but never had DOA parts and never reattended so no hard facts on that  meanwhile lenovo/ibm  30 different types of screws 3 different types for the back plate so you had to know what you were taking apart not logical in terms of what you had remove always required the manual and bios upgrades weren't as easy to source nor download never fixed for residential always corporations  My 2 cents there from experience
This isn't really an upgradable laptop. It just has more easily replaceable parts. It's not upgradable until you can upgrade the CPU or gpu. Until then it's just as upgradable as 90% of gaming laptops just easier since you don't have to open it up the same way.
14:34 Monke
buy me free pc plus
slap a dedicated graphic and i'm sold
L o v e.
Question: Isn't this what Project Ara was supposed to be but for phones? Anyone know why did it fail? And how much chance is there of Framework succeeding? I'd love for them to gain traction and start selling their products in my country as well
I wish this came out 6 months ago.
One of the best tech innovation so far!
when you watch this on your 2016 toshiba i3 3rd gen dead battery 🙂
I needed to upgrade the RAM on my uncles HP laptop, I had to remove the back plane, the KB, Then I had to remove pretty much everything to just get to the slot for the SODIMM, it took me ages to get it right, this looks like a wet dream to me atm
Lol that video came out at a perfect time when manufacturers are soldering so much ram recently.
Id love to be able to afford one of them badboys when they come out, I only have simple requirements for my laptop, AMD, NOT a TN+Film (Crap) display, 1080P or better and UPGRADEABLE and that I can actually work on it!
Why would anyone downvote that video?
Its a good toy For a really good boy!
Modularity seems very good but this seems like the Fairphone to me. Watch TechAltars "Why Have Modular Smartphones Failed?" on the topic
This product is way cooler than I originally thought.  Every configuration option on their site has the option of "bring your own",  from the wifi card to the operating system.
Finely some honest hardware, I'm getting one!
16:30 WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE BATTERY CAN SWELL UP I ALWAYS USE MY LAPTOP ON AC POWER
THIS IS AWESOME!
It would have been nice if you actually said if the laptop is "good", how does the keyboard feel, etc. Would give this video more credibility I feel
me trying to sponsor something: yo, buy this, it works fine and it's good and cheap linus: making a whole video with only positive stuff
11:28 - 11:36  Hahaha i coughed out a big Dell too
Web dev belike: ahh framework
The battery thing got me excited. I’ve lost a battery on my notebook because of that  That’s so cool
I have bought too many nice electronics in the last year, but if I hadn't I would definitely consider one of these :D It looks like it is begging to be a well built linux machine.
The problem I have with modular devices is that I tend to hold onto my electronics for like 5-10 years. I had my mac laptop for a solid 7 before getting a new laptop. By the time I'm ready to upgrade, I'm almost certain that they won't be selling upgrade parts due to incompatible standards.
11:56 wtf
That cracked phone tho 😂
You know when this guy is pretty much hyped about something, it is something really really good :D
Actually there are laptops with replacable CPUs
Does that mean you can put in the TPM chip for Windows 11 😒
My looking really great. DIY means putting everything together yourself?
I'm sold! Take my money!!
Very interesting 😳
This is something that I could potentially be interested in, though I'll have to see if they can ship with Linux pre-installed.
The expansion 'cards' that plug into the USB C ports seem to be wide enough for 2 USB A ports - I'm surprised they only went with 1.
Better not to drop it and shattered into pieces.
You bought the segue??
12:30 where?
I think that I'm only who saw Nirav Patel on framework team
power on AC attach would be useful for turning on remotely via WiFi plug socket
This is like the IBM pc. A revolution is on its way.
Impossible.
good, now do this with cars pls
Hug of death from the viewer is gonna be very real very soon.   I want to buy one too!
this is the first laptop i'm genuinely tempted to buy. i don't even need one i just want one and support them, damn
It's a great idea but sounds like it's just made to break... No?
This is the kind of laptop modularity we all always needed for so long.
It’s a great Product needs a bigger screen and a way to upgrade the graphics would make it amazing
Louis Rossmann entered the chat
I don't need a new laptop at the moment, but I want to support this desperately. Thus, I am telling all my friends who are as nerdy as I am with Tech!
its kinda ugly
Am I just weird? I have a Lenovo legion 5 and I like that is a little thicker and heavier than what people seem to want (not redicoulasly so though)  and I can open it one handed haha
This needs more support, so we can actually force big tech to be more competitive rather than controlling
This is honestly, sick af.
I hope there will be released versions with AMD processor
Also, the great thing is that screws can be always tighten in the future, glue not.
I'm so close to buying :S Future additions hopefully include: various keyboards (preferably 1 with close resemblance of Thinkpad keyboard typing feel), 15.6 inch size with touch, vents at the back (powerful vent or 2). I want to buy this instead of any other laptop manufacturer next, but the keyboard and ventilation is critical for me. Screen size is next, but if I only use it next to an external monitor I can make due I guess. I'll keep my eye on this.
This seriously reminds me of when OnePlus released their first phone, and I seriously hope these guys stick to how they've started and don't go the way of OnePlus
Linus this is how it feels to get out of an abusive relationship
Damn, even an option "without Windows" and they are cooperating with some Linux distros on testing. I would prefer AMD cpu, but I have to say, their product sounds really interesting.
Like a Lego Lappy !
This is awsome!!!
I'd love this as a uni laptop as I know I'll be able to maintain it myself, and I'm sure the computer science students would love it and it is surely good to modify and tinker with for the security sector, as a pen testers laptop or something,  the only issues I see on the web page is the modules to swap out don't seem to be available, so how am I supposed to fit nothing but storage in it to brag my lap top has more capacity than yours lol,  so they need to add a spares page and other options so I can make a portable second screen and touch screen and or low latency screens or ips panel options etc, as well as upgrades options for speakers or webcam/ mic, alternative keyboards, or just a different colour keyboard or chassis etc   also can they make a 17 inch one with room to upgrade mobo and batteries at some point  and it would be nice if it was possible to have a gpu on some variations too
Proof that component standardization of laptops is something that can and SHOULD be a thing so we can build laptops like we have been desktops for years. such a novel concept to be able to replace components that are outdated/bad. screen breaks? buy a new one that pops in place. keyboard? motherboard? Yep. that's the world I want to live in and this is the first step.
THE ONE I BEEN LOOKING FOR !!! BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE LIKE THAT !!!
Would say the feature of battery dissconect should be on normal panel & not BIOS for... a bit less complex users.
Nice concept for a laptop but come on Linus, show us some benchmarks and how it performs
I started getting excited by this. At last, could I have a laptop with OFP module support? Optic Fibre or Gigabit Ethernet, using a standard module designed by Cisco? Alas, it seems the modular IO doesn't support any networking.  Not yet, anyway...
No discrete graphics... :(
What if just make a removable on-board CPU that can be remove from the motherboard?
looks excellent, well done Framework
aight imma get one for my mom
Amazing
Linus: You cant remove the headphone jack even if you wanted to Apple: :( Samsung: :( Lenovo: :) Gateway: you guys still exist?
Bigger corpos dont make their laptops hard to repair because of trust, its because of greed.
god just imagine a mechanical keyboard upgrade to this thing
I dont get why the cpu isn't upgradable. I've had laptop workstations with upgradable cpus and gpus. Those were the only laptops I bought, so I was suprised by the soldered in CPUs of other laptops when I wanted someting smaller. My dell precision 2014 (replaced 2018), still had the same chasis as the 2010 model (I don't think later models were truly fully upgradable) Linus is pretty accurate when he cites that time with the begining the end of fully upgradable laptops.
This title is misleading... Upgradable includes cpu and gpu... All I am seeing is "configurable"... This is like saying a rasberry pi is upgradable.. Device interfaces don't change often... USB display ports etc will be around for a long time... Cpu and gpu changes more often therefor that's the first thing anyone would want to upgrade... Kudus to the company for being so transparent about its hardware tho but I don't see it as a edge over any other laptop..
So basically, let the engineers do their thing and lock the accountants up. I like it!
What do you take me for SOME KIND OF MONKEY
I have a beast pc but holy f* I want THIS!
Which laptop manufacturers are doing the chassi intrusion thing? Havent run across it yet
Hope they open up shop in EU soon!
So this is the equivalent of playing with legos as a child 🔥
They did it them selves so we could do it too. :)
this is good, finally someone is going in the right direction I hope this project succeed and we start seeing more variety say gaming laptops and such
What abt gpu?
I was thinking they might delay the launch, but I love that they launched on time :)
Georgie cooper: don't patch the tires buy new
I literally only wish they had a mobile GPU on the main board. Maybe future revisions. Not a buy for me for now due to that but definitely something I'll be watching.
Very cool!
This is a definite buy. even just to support them. but all the features and build quality and thought that's gone into the details. From an engineer to another. I tip my hat at Framework.
That's a great concept. I hope they will ship to Switzerland relatively soon
Give me a laptop with a universal swap-able socket for gpu and cpu and I will toss out ALL of my life's earnings for it. Give me different cooling options. They say this shit cannot be engineered but if I can do it with half-assed cad experience, a multi-million dollar company can do it with over 100 engineers. Give me socketed cmos like in the old days so I can write and burn my own bios. Give me socketed chipset so I can update to newest features for a cpu line.  These requests are NOT difficult or anywhere near impossible to implement. God damn it the solutions are so simple.
The day framework lays hand on discrete gpu models, it will change laptop landscape forever.  Dell will deliver this form factor as Linus mentioned.
does it support a graphics card ?
Absolutely in love with this concept
Damn! THIS IS WHAT I WANT ALL MY LIFE! Just shut up and take my money!
AND their website runs just fine WITHOUT Javascript!
dream laptop !
Umm, wrong about Dell!!! Yeah, maybe not entry level stuff (Which includes XPS), by my Dell Precision, definitely. ALL parts are upgradable, I’ve upgraded my Nvidia Quadro, got 4x DIMMs which I upgraded to 64GB, added another SSD (3x SSDs) and even added an integrated 4G card. And all Dell manuals are FANTASTIC. The only issue is there is there are 2x screw sizes only, umm I will repeat 2x (Wow, is that to much)? The only benefit I see there, is that the I/O is modular, so what: I have 3x USB-A, SD card, audio, USB-C, separate power, Display port, full RJ45.
This company just won the game
Love the concept, and the implementation, but no numpad, make it a non-starter for me, your mileage may vary
I really hope a partnership between framekwork & dbrand is coming in the future. If so, there is going to so much freedom in changing how your laptop looks (bezel and keyboard skin).
This concept is prone to fail. As a customer you just can not trust the manufacturer that he will provide these upgradeable parts for many years. If this product just fails to sell like intended, it will never see any new interesting upgradeable  parts.
yaaaaa kick xps mac 🦶 out of the shelf
2 things come to mind: 1. better for the environment (less bad) 2. 2nd hand modul market
That clear keyboard looks sick! But I am more excited about the possibility of an ergonomic layout. On a laptop. That would be a real game changer. No major company dares to deviate from the conventional key arrangement for fear of alienating customers. But if it is user‐replaceable? They could have a go at it!
God damn if I needed just a basic ass laptop I would absolutely get this thing.  What a fantastic product and I hope their company takes off, does well, and offers more stuff like this.
Admire their effort but this will last about 5m. Whilst I also hate the idea of hard to repair computers, it only comes up as an issue if you need to repair your computer. How often does that happen?
Thank you for covering this. Looks like I wouldn't have known about it otherwise.
This is the first time I've considered replacing my early 2008 MacBook Pro.
I'll get one as soon they start selling in EU.
I just want to have a laptop with all this but then there is no CPU. Instead the trackpad, now with a glorious touch display, is my phone and it pops out when I need it to come with me.
I like this thing! going to get one when my current device fails.
Is this heaven ?🤔
Linus : F all other  laptop manufacturers.go buy framework laptop Framework website : crashed.
There is just something about a wired mouse.
This laptop is 200% better than Macbook or Dell xps.   Rights to Repair, 🤘Rocks.
This and external gpu support and you can have a modular gaming laptop!
wait, what? Did he just said "fingerprint scanner Goodix is featuring the Linux driver"?
Cool, of i could upgrade my MBP 15 2016 SSD 😭
Not available in my country yet. I hope it will be one day. This is a perfect laptop.
we've tried this with phones. Remember Project ARA? Although I hope modular will be the future for everything because of e-waste and everything...but how is this different than Project ARA?
So only integrated graphics for the time being?
can you uninstall the bios?
Wow what a game changer! Finally someone is really thinking right. I'll check if my pocket allows me to buy one! But hey I didn't know only Microsoft and Apple can have that magnetic charging port!!! But your idea makes good workaround!!! nice!
Does it has dedicated gpu?
That battery disconnect and run with the wall charger sold me, goddamn
If the trackpad and software can get close to macOS levels of awesomeness then this is revolutionary and has to take off. It just has to.
Wow this is the most useful thing I need that I never thought I needed haha.
How about cpu/gpu? Are they replaceble?
I want one! Unfortunately my wallet won't let me.
This is the first comment I ever left on a LTT video. But seeing this laptop I could not not leave a comment. This laptop is AMAZING! Color coded screws, QR codes for manuals to pop up instantly about the component you're trying to work with... I hope this replaces the market standard over time.
First of all, the tech specs for their Laptops on website looks mild and dull. There isn't enough details to understand the quality of the laptops. That brings doubts in mind when trying to identify the best affordable PC they ship. I hope they improvise on this area apart from 1.5 year dev time and beautifully crafted and miniatured easy access features. And secondly, I have a question for LTT. 1) is it possible to connect lets say a Graphics Card via these expansion slots?   In spite of some brilliant Hardware improvements they have I'm curious to see how well it takes over PC market in terms of overall performance and customer experience.  Thanks and regards.
It's awesome! Do they have Italian keyboard layout and do they ship to Italy?
I love this, really. Totally love this design. So apple has no reason to say they cannot build a thin laptop that user can replace the components y themself.
yeah this is a buy for sure
I totally love this laptop, I love modular design. I can take the components that I don’t want them on it off. and upgradeable. Cool
already preordered. The new era has come.
It’s no MacBook!
One of my top 3 LTT videos, the others being the 'Motherboard Turbo Nerd Edition' and the 'Sensel deep dive' videos.
apple doesnt make thier stuff difficult to repair because of "not trusting the end user"...
presenting the macbook killer
Can it run Windows 11 ?
FINALLY !!!!  eeeeh ??
Years later... Upgradeable Phones
Laptops have stayed the same for long time, This is Tesla moment. ❤️❤️❤️
Imma be disappointed if this doesn't become the industry standard
Bro sent me one laptop like this.... I need it ....👍
Since the cpu is soldered to the motherboard, will it be difficult for them to sell just those motherboard+cpu that fit into the casing?
take the motherboard out :P
You can tell Linus is a salesman and not a hardware guru because watching Linus hold or install hardware is soo cringy and painful. He loves touching connectors and pins  E,g when Destin told him not to hold a NASA storage in a certain way and he continues to hold it the wrong way.
PROB WITH QR CODES IS THIS WILL FADE DO TO HEAT AND USE   SO YA A PAPER BOOK IS BETTER
11:33 , gold.
“Swapping out the battery when it starts degrading…” lmao, just yesterday I had to go replace my MacBook’s dying battery, and they wanted 36,000 rupees (about 480 USD) for it. What bullshit.
No big GPU though.  Do this but for gaming laptops
Laptop not easily upgradable/repairable? To quote another YouTuber I watch: "I ain't having it."
This is a great start for DIY laptops but EVOO laptops are still a greater value, for the time being, no?
Make it a gaming laptop with full power specs that weighs like 10+ lbs with a 5+ lb brick and you sell me. :(
What happened to the modular phone we heard a long time ago?
Here is a reference to Linus previous vid: https://youtu.be/x7rt6BZYscs
Funny thing is that I was just shown Dell's AD before starting this video 😂 11.35
All laptops should be like this. If all these components become standardised like ATX, I could just build my own laptop by selecting the parts I want.
You didn't buy the segway, THEY BOUGHT the spot from you!
NOW INTERNET... DO YOUR THING AND MAKE THIS COMPANY A HUGE SUCCESS WE NEED MORE OF IT
Without further adieu...
They need to make a gaming laptop with the same concept.
basicly "my gf is a terrible person"
Repairability should be considered when speaking about end user experience. Good job by framework. This is how you reduce e-waste.
Definitely a paid review.
This is the way
Cmon Ikea, this the piece of electronics you were missing
he got  new toy
I want one of these so much.. this is exactly what ive been looking for for years
This is some disruptive technology if I've ever seen it. Looks amazing. I hope they succeed
Ngl, I’m very tempted to buy this laptop. The only thing stopping me is that my current laptop works fine as is.
This sounds too good. If I don't hear any issues (overheating, cracked screen, etc.), I'll probably order one in a month. Very promising stuff
If this company actually does what they said I'm very interested and I'll buy my own I've always wanted an upgradable laptop like that but I wanna wait for a touch screen option and a ethernet plug in as its essential for my work and maybe a 360 hinge would be great. I'm definitely gonna keep my eye on there upcoming products and we'll see great review by linus
All it needs now is to include Getoo preinstalled.
Guys we need to make this the most successful laptop ever
This is amazing.
Don't need a laptop. Could use one I guess. I mean it's useful for when I travel and go out. My old one is just plain old now. Ok fine yes, I need one. I want one. Shut up and take my money!   And that's how you talk yourself into getting a laptop you really don't need. =D
Love it! Hope it will be available in Europe soon!
ALL DELL LAPTOPS WERE LIKE THIS IN 2005!!!
Big shame there is no gpu, and it doesn't seem like you mentioned that part either, which is also disappointing, coz it would be good to know what options there are, or indeed how good the integrated graphics are for modern games. Is an external gpu by thunderbolt/usb 3.2 gen 2 possible?
This one of the most refreshingly original and consumer friendly products i've seen in a loooooong time. If this can be sustainable and profitable for Framework, i sincerely hope that they  become the biggest laptop manufacturer EVER.
I would love this to start a movement. The ability to just upgrade like a desktop is going to awesome.
If they had an option with a GPU, I would've ordered one 10 minutes ago. For now I'll just hold on upgrading my laptop and wait for a model with one
How many companies could make millions just by going "hey what if we actually made something sick that's fun and good to own." Like seriously Google's clearly obliterated motto of "don't be evil" is such a great brand motto and it's stupid that we have to say that. MORE STUFF LIKE THIS!
As someone getting into the cyber security workforce, this is a seriously cool product. If I can't fix my current laptop I'll be getting one of these for sure. Very cool product.
I wish they had options for gpu
Could you imagine them offering a tablet-convertible bezel (think Fujitsu style) and Waccom-equipped panels? Oh to be in a world where you can have an art laptop useful for something OTHER then art.
Why does he treat this new laptop like a bag of potatoes?
Investors who are tech savvy should really support this company. This is huge.
i want this so much
Can it run ark
This is incredible. I want one of these so bad! I gotta sell 2 of my laptops to justify it, though. Hopefully they sell for a good price!
FRAMEWORK laptop diy edition starts at $749. What's awesome about the affordability is that you can choose and pay for what you want.
Why does he still use a note 9
I hope this company has public milestone and how much costumer they need to come reach that, so it will encourage more people to buy.. I hope this company someday has marketplace in Indonesia..
Its why I actually like HP as a company, they historically have been pro-right to repair. I can buy most parts for my laptop directly and repair it myself. I recently upgraded my SSD and its held together with 8 screws. It just was a B&&ch to open, I tore the case apart. That said, it makes repairing my moms Lenovo flex look like hell. I killed her laptop because the main screw to open the bottom is underneath the keyboard.   My last HP Pavilion Dv7 was bizzarely semi-modular. You could release one screw and access the ram bay, and only about 4 to get to HDD Bay 1, and it took one screw to take out the blu ray player.
At 9:30 - Friggin' nothing more true than when dealing with Killer WiFi cards. I have gone through TWO because they pull right off the board. Cheap POS, I'm now using a proper Intel card but MAN that was dumb.
Everything should be built like this... One of the ways to save our planet
It’s been so long that I have forgotten we have right to upgrade and repair our devices.
who gonna use this thing, i bet that even those guy's will not ?
Awesome laptop!
Once my laptop dies, I'm absolutely getting this
Somehow I just know the huge manufactures are going to do everything they can to bury this.
Wow battery disconnect in software. Imagine if Framework made a 16in with a huge cooler with all the exhaust going out the back. You can either use it as it is on a cooling pad or stuck closed+upright on a stand then have the brick run a hexacore CPU and an RTX xx60 chips like a desktop, then you just flip it back on when you have to use it elsewhere or when you cycle the battery.
Wait, the specs for this laptop are actually insane for the price...
I would love to see these guys offer maybe a keyboard deck or expansion card with GPIO pins. It would make prototyping projects amazing. Heck, it says on their website they plan to open the expansion cards to 3rd party designers; I'd love to see an Arduino or ESP32 as an interfaceable companion card.
Can we replace all part of dell laptops?
Linus stop pirating windows
do we know if they are going to have laptop GPUs for this/are they going to be upgradeable?
But can it run crysis?
This almost brought a tear to my eye <3
I'd love to see a larger version, like a desktop-replacement type, with a DGPU and the required cooling for it.
can we upgrade for dedicated gpus!?
Ya i was very confused by the start until you finished
... so no one has rebuilt a HP 840 G4?
The cost of i7- 1165g7 motherboard is $1049 and we can get a good i7-1165g7 laptop under $850
I'd love it if they had an AMD option with an APU
transition should have been: "......speaking of companies that are fu*king awesome.... micro center."
MEEE WHO JUST GOT A NEW LAPTOP, FFS
I have owned a Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro since 2014, and have updated It to the Max! But I want USB-C and WiFi  AX and find it impossible to upgrade. I’ll be ordering this Framework Computer ASAP! Thanks Linus for you excellent reviews!
this might be THE perfect timing for this laptop to be released..
These people deserve to get somewhere with their products, cause this is some very useful, high quality stuff  sure there's some kinks to work out, but its a very great start
I AM BUYING ONE RIGHT AWAY THANK YOU LINUS!!!!!
Next step is a nice GPU and AMD chip, rip Intel ;)
I wouldn’t be surprised if razer ended up buying or trying to buy this
My laptop is running on 6 or 7 years old now... and if it dies I think I've found the perfect replacement.
if i didnt use macOS and was in the market for a new laptop, instant buy.
i just went from six to midnight.
When my current laptop dies i`ll be getting one of those bad boys :D

11:56 when you nût but she keep sucking
This is probably one of the coolest laptops I have seen.
I like this but the inside looks extremely similar to mid tier HP and Acer laptops from like a year ago. Aside from having proprietary upgrade options it isn’t that different to most laptops short of MacBooks and dells in my experience. Almost all laptops have cable management trays like that.
You didn't buy any sponsor they're paying you....
Very solarpunk design for a laptop!
im wanting to upgrade my motherboard an cpu. im was going to buy the motherboard an cpu bundle. just worried that it want work for my pc, im new to this an just want to get what i need. can someone help plz.
Gahh just bought a laptop
If they can get the screen bezels a little thinner. I'd consider it as my next.
The smoggy slip proportionately pass because apparatus reversely bare beside a obnoxious stopwatch. capricious, zealous lace
This is the coolest thing, I actually want one now haha
I just want to watch the video about this cool laptop. Not a session of brand bashing
Damn, this is really appealing. But i wont buy any of these until they would be cheaper than same (in terms of hardware) notebooks from HP, Dell, Acer etc., bc for a thousand bucks i could have a much better configuration than this, sadly.
Now I wish I needed a new laptop. I hope this company flourishes so I can get one of their products when I need one
This is awesome
They should be offering a lower resolution screen just to demonstrate screen upgrasability.  Furthermore, use industry standard screen types available from general suppliers as protection against company failure.  Let us pop in any LVD screen we can get and leave spare screwholes for common bracket variations in the market.  This would also allow a touch option on the purchase menu, just not at current max resolution.
Thats looks like an awesome laptop. Battery management is questionable though. HP 850 G4's would charge to 100% and stop,, allow battery to drop to 90% before putting anything back in. Well mine did, still going strong after 2017. I look after 900 of the machines, seen a number of swollen batteries of latter model machines, 1040 and 850 or 840s, so where did HP go wrong. What is needed is to reduce the E-waist I see so often. Some Scandinavian countries are looking to remove tax on repairing things. Biggest mode of failure is coffee spills on the KB, second is people dropping the machine, third is the battery, then the SSD, OH!! Fans!!! when are manufactures going to put enough lube on the blasted bearings!!!
Funny thing is my idiot hands have repaired a few MacBook screens. They don't come into my repair shop very often but I've had to do them lol
This is the next laptop I'm buying once my macbook dies Would really love them to add European power adapter and national keyboard options soon
This laptop is so good, I'm re-watching the reviews for fun.
This deserves to be purchased
HP as a company used to be built on repairability and upgradability, but betrayed us all, even their "enterprise" spinoff has gone all asshole.
PRETTY DOPE VIDEO. LOVE THE CONCEPT OF THIS. EASY WAY TO GET PEOPLE INTO COMPUTERS AND IT
what did linus do to his phone?
I used my old Acer Aspire One D270 1 GB RAM as server, just popped motherboard, threw it in shelf, installed minimal debian and woila, working server. But, there was a downside that it was VERY slow server. It was processing 1500 sends of telegram messages for over an hour.
The funniest part when he was talking sh!t about dell LMFAO, That was funny
Consumers don't have to choose between a chunky laptop and the manufacturer soldering the ram to the board. That's just an artificial talking points that the manufacturers have been pushing
Oof, no gpu and 999$ for the base model. I like what they doing but the value is not there. There are a few better gaming laptops at that price new, even better if you shop around second hand....
Tried to buy one and they already have insufficient stock! Ahhhhhhh!!
Man 4 minutes into the video and I already want one.
This is the first step in reducing ewaste across the board.  There's many many more steps to go, but this is a start.
Fully costumizable with no obvious sacrifice, is it? I see a very obvious one: what about GPU. Maybe I am wrong,  but how gamer compatible is their included and only officially available GPU (intel irisXe). From what I can read its comparable to cards released more than ten years ago and not even able to run fortnite 720p low flawlessly, so unless they have some upgrade options there as well, that sounds like a major sacrifice to me.
This is really amazing, in every aspect. One point of clarification - the USB-C expansion modules are USB4, not USB3, and the internal connector is actually confirmed to be Thunderbolt (I believe TB4 specifically). I definitely want to get one of these, but a DGPU is a must have for me. Other nice-to-have's on the mainboard would be eSIM and a second m.2 slot. Nice-to-have's that people could make and sell on the marketplace would be higher-res touchscreen displays, a Sensel trackpad, RFID reader, RJ-45 jack, and 1/4" in (great for musicians).  ~ Jamie
What about Graphic card? Does it have M.2 expansion slots?
Well… gorgeous is quite a stretch.
This is the single coolest laptop I have ever seen.   I definitely want one. I just don't have much need for a laptop.
We just gonna ignore the fact that it's got no dedicated GPU?
I checked on the website. The price of everything is fair and reasonable. I would definitely buy one but a 13.5 display for me is a no go. I've used small laptops before like the Microsoft surface and i hated it. I need a full size keyboard with the numberpad. They probably have only one size to save on manufacturing cost.   It would be nice if you could choose from 15.6 and 17.3 Also there is no option for a Gpu. I know this is probably the hardest thing to do modular. So this is unlikely to happen.  Will definitely buy from them if they make bigger screens
Respect.
I hope people love the concept and buy it so much that it becomes the new normal. Other companies are forced to implement the same.
Too much drama for explaining technical solutions. Your acting has improved to HOLLYWOOD mode 😁
He hacked up 'Dell', but I DEFINITELY heard 'Intel'! 🤣🤣🤣  Of which both are indeed correct. Naturally.
I think I speak for everyone when I say Framework please, please don't let apple buy you out!
One nitpick about the usb modules is the fact those only hold one usb c port where I see 2 fitting. Probably not too hard to make one with 2 ports.
CPU soldered? I'm out....................>.>
These guys will be heroes if they succeed in the future. I really hope modular laptops become a thing. No reason to limit modularity to desktop PCs. The form factor is the only difference, everything else works the same.
what's really amazing is that they could come out with a larger version later (~15") with better graphics and share all the same components and IO modules, I can see myself getting two laptops from them
I love the idea...  I want  AMD... ryzen 4k something... and those i/o thingies, they should be able to fit two usb-c ports on a single one... so you only need one for power brick + one output. oh and real-laptops have ethernet ports.
hi
Just like Fairphone, the pricing is not there. If they can make them cheaper than other prebuilt laptops, then this would be amazing, even if a bare processor only computer (ex; HP with the base i5 is $550, while this one is $750 with no ram, storage, or wifi)
I bet Framework uses RAM with good timings. :)   I hope the company does very well.  I want to see them offer 16" and 17" laptop with good thermals.
18:24 Coupon, not queuepon.
The perfect PC laptop doesn't exist...... wait a second, WTF! This thing is just amazing!!!
_I despise devices that are exceedingly thin!_ _And I wish that manufacturers and designers would wake up and stop making fragile crap for the sake of being thin._
Linus team, Thank you! I've been looking for thorough enough reviews of this computer, and my questions are answered. Ordering now!  There is one thing I wish it'd come in the pipeline: ergonomic split keyboard design - obviously configurable!
Now see, I don't like laptops, I prefer desktops or maybe a surface tablet. This right here, if I ever need a laptop, this is what I'm getting. If anyone every asks me for a laptop recommendation, this is what I'm recommending them. My only criticism, assuming the screen can be upgraded to touch later (for those that want touch on a laptop) is since you NEED at least one USB C for charging that should've been built in so you could have 4 dedicated swappable ports.
Who is this company? I want to give them my money. This straight up says F the system. I will support these guys!!! This is good for business.
I love the idea but do you think they would be able to add a integrated gpu to it? It would be nice to see a customizable gaming laptop
But what about gaming? I game on the go (I travel a lot) so I tend to prefer a pseudo-desktop replacement laptop with discrete graphics. It doesn't sound like the Framework has an option for that (yet?).
Damn you Linus! Now I want one!
SOLD! Just preordered mine, finally going to ditch my old junker of an HP laptop and its totally kaput battery. I've had it with those scummy manufacturers giving the finger to right-to-repair. VIVA LA REVOLUTION! LONG LIVE FRAMEWORK!  UPDATE 9-9-2021: It arrived! Cool!
These guys should team up with the System76 guys. A well polished, premium, highly configurable Linux laptop would be awesome. (Yeah, yeah, I know you can just install Pop OS (or anything else) on it, but theres something to be said for the hardware and software teams actually working together. Plus this looks like to be well above the fit and finish of System76’s (I’m assuming) mass produced rebranded laptops.
Gonna definitely buy one once they get Ryzen CPU options in there.
this is like a gimmick but actually useful for the average consumer
How can I invest in these guys...this kind of thing is something I want to get behind.
swap it to macOS?
If you watch old Computer Chronicles here on YouTube older laptops had a lot of expansion slot like add ons. Reminds me of those.  https://youtu.be/zRCBepOHaYk
Please Steve Wozniak be the CEO of this company and rename it to Orange so that people know,  right from that point they can compare Apple to Orange !!!
Girlfriend's dad: "what's that square in your wallet, son?"  Me: My steam library sir
I really hope that they succeed and force other companies to start adopting the modular design to keep repairability… one can dream…
When he almost tossed it over his shoulder and even the camera man freaked out 😂
If I hadn't just bought a new laptop I'd be all over this. On second thought, what do I need fiscal responsibility for? I might buy one anyway.
if EA made laptops
would love to have this in 5 years in the future, since in my country that would cost 5 to 8 times the price right now.
I want it 🤩
This video really hits close to home: I just bought an SK Hynix P31, an Intel Wi-Fi 6 card, and some Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut to breathe new life into my Lenovo Yoga 920 from 2017. Hopefully, in 4-5 years, when this laptop can't keep up anymore, I'll be able to buy one of these.
Impossible for Crapple? Well, yes, 100% impossible. They would rather fall on a sword.    I was going to say commit Seppuku instead. But Crapple has no honor.
Wasn't there a cell phone manufacturer which developed a modular phone where the innards like modem, storage, phone, speaker, etc., were independently upgradeable?  Consumer reception was ice cold.
Begs the question: are there limitations to the amount of same type of module? As in, can you plug in 4x HDMI modules, and does it actually work with all 4 at the same time?
I havnt seen you like a product so much that it makes you rage on every other product in its field. very entertaining to watch. very very cool product.
I would probably jump on this if it had Ryzen.
Please let this mindset become the norm. Guys, let's make this a huge success other manufacturers can't ignore, vote with your wallet
wow, just... wow man I hope more and more tech companies do something like this. finally
In the future they should take back an old motherboard and give you a discount on the newer one
I hope they make it, I'm seriously considering this + external GPU when I have to retire my desktop due to Windows 10 EOL.  Also, there are already magnetic thunderbolt connectors on Amazon, so I could see making/modding a USB-C module with a recessed connector that would be compatible with one of those, and keep the whole footprint inside the case.
Honestly?  The only thing that keeps me from buying this laptop is the lack of a dedicated GPU (granted I could just get an eGPU most likely) and the fact that I already bought a new laptop a few months ago XD But I love what they are doing, and if I see anyone in the market, I will definitely tell them about this brand. The repairability, pro consumer steps taken, and the modularity not just aligns with how I hope the market trends in the future, but also gives upgradability for the future, allowing your laptop of all things to stay relevant for a longer time!
I really need this one. Literally you can do resolve work on a customizable laptop.

Waiting for the Ryzen version, excellent idea, great quality parts. All laptops should be upgradeable, the disposable garbage they sell is not cheap enough to be disposable, not good enough to age gracefully either.
I’m gonna do some reading On their website but I’m 95% sold!!!!! This laptop is all I’ve ever wanted I just wish it was an apple but I can get over it and re learn windows for this one I believe it’s gonna be worth it!!!! I also wish the motherboard section with the CPU etc. was modular but I’m sure that’s not realistic
About fucking time. Now maybe sustainability can become something tech people actually give a shit about. Stupid fucking humans selling themselves up the river because shiny things. Humans are such easy prey.
Amazing laptop. Gonna be my next machine.
Commenting for the sake of commenting
This looks amazing!  I’m super excited to see how it lives in Linus’s life.
I just watch this after watching the Panasonic Toughbook 55 video! I like this concept a lot! Imagine buying a laptop like a PC and being able to upgrade it for like 5 years!
Challenge for Linus us the laptop for a month and give us a full opinion/review
Any government or enterprise that makes promises about being environmental friendly should screw the other manufactures and buy this laptop in bulk. THIS is how you make statements about the topic and therefore should be fully supported.
I don’t know if I have ever seen Linus this enthusiastic. I share his feelings.
"They even provided CAD drawings so you can design your own case if you want to" - So Linus..... you ARE going to do that, right??
The modules are basically dongles. Thunderbolt type-c would of been better and could of had the graphic card upgradable
If only they made a Ethernet port!!! ...no re the micro SD can't also have full size.... I use both frequently
YES! Technology can be friendly!!!!! OMG!!!!
Hmmm...🤔 I wonder where the dislikes are coming from.
I still dream for laptop cpu and gpu upgradability.
what about one where you can slide your phone in? with models that support "desktop" mode?
"Some little hacks guy" already made one https://www.amazon.com/REDBEAN-Magnetic-Connector-Transfer-Compatible/dp/B082WY91CS
You can't switch out GPU and CPU so what the hell is the point? By the time my laptop screen and ports starts not working right, it'll be time to land fill the system and get a new one so I don't see the value of only making irrelevant parts modular while leaving the heart and brain of the system unchangeable.
this is a step in the right direction nay, giant leap in the right direction
Who would want a product like this tho?
2012 mac mini moment
2012 mac mini moment
Ok! I'll get one! But first - get me a Ryzen or RISC!
The whole motherboard comes off ..!
Engineering things to make repair harder is not a trust thing. 🤣 It's an evil thing.
15 years ago consumers and manufacturers were on the same page, then the Apple nation arrived and showed how easy consumers can be brainwashed.
The whole laptop flexing thing is a terrible argument anyway. My Dell G3 is way thicker and heavier than that thing, yet flexes over twice as much because the build quality is shit.  And as much as I hate Apple, I would say their MacBooks are the gold standard for build quality, just because you can't really flex a _solid fucking aluminum chassis_
better be investing in this brand
Make him take his lithium. Annoying. Out.
the modular IO is a great idea. I hope other manufactures will do something like that too.
This is everything everyone ever wanted.
Somehow I get the feeling one of the big pre-built manufacturers will buy this company up, and either A) shelve the idea or B) sell it for a FAT markup.
I'm gonna get one and put Linux on it.
Seems super cool, but it looks rather flimsy. Ill wait for a more robust laptop before looking into getting one from them.
Will have to wait till there is a graphics card expansion but eagerly waiting - very cool and well priced
God bless these people!!  Started clapping like crazy (alone at home) at 8:52.  Couldn't hold it XD.  Excellent review, btw!
Once they offer models with discrete gpus I’m game. Get it.
Linus Tech Tips is like junk mail at this point
At the end of the video: "Did you just say 'queuepon'?! It's coupon!, the 'u' comes after the 'o'!" ¬¬
First time I regret I already bought good laptop
This laptop looks amazing. Edit to say spot on with the mouse thing. I have a laptop Im pretty happy with and I also run my mouse and keyboard from the left side.
Damn I want one now but touchscreen is a big deal for me. I'll wait till they add it
Linus: This is awesome!  Go buy this computer! The PC-selling sponsors who paid for this Framework ad: Wut?
That laptop will live 3-4 years like any other. Because solder is same like on the other laptops. Which mean he will not live longer than 4 years. Why should i buy "LEGO" laptop? If that is in the school to educate students OK. But in real life, NO.
Video card?
They’re killing you on CPU upgrades. I5-1135G7 is standard, and a good CPU. Their cost difference on the two faster i7-1165G7/1185G7 CPUs is around $125, but they charge $300 to upgrade to the 1165 and $700 to upgrade to the 1185.  You don’t get more cores, or more threads for that, but you do gain some max clock speed, 50% larger cache, and a bump from 80 to 96 EUs on the IGP. You also get a few additional features the processors support, none of which will matter to 90% of buyers.   On the plus side, if you want to help ensure they make a profit, be sure to bump up to one of these CPUs to pad their bottom line. Also, looks like those may ship sooner, so you can consider part of that expense as paying for priority.
Will never buy ANY other brand ever again except for FRAMEWORK
Hey Linus… I’ve ordered one as well 😎
The steam library would be useless. Unless it had a swappable GPU? One can hope
Looks dog water.
Is the free pair of headphones in the description a scam?
it would be killer if they offer a AMD motherboard and it would be 1 to 1 compatible with the machine if it came with intel initially.
Why wouldn’t you boot to a 1tb? I like my 980 pro1tb and even the 980 1tb is good too
I see Dbrand breathing heavily right now.
I see Dbrand breathing heavily right now.
This computer is the perfect opportunity for folks to "vote with their wallet/purse/money-clip/etc". You want to be able to use YOUR hardware how YOU want to? Go for it. Make it your own? They INSIST!  I can't wait to see what the modules will evolve as part of the ecosystem.
It's the future
They could save themselves some money, and get rid of the microSD expansion option and just make it a full size. If someone wanted to buy a notebook computer with a microSD card slot there's enough of them out there now. They need to get the full size SD card slot module.
Linus I went and bought my own graphics card :C
This is so cool. A really good step in the right direction. Really hope they succeed. But, please bring amd cpus. Also, it seems quite possible to have a design where you could just plug a external gpu when you wanna game. Imagine how cool it would be to have that kind of flexibility.
I hope they make a gaming laptop line up in the future.
Around 15 minuit mark.... there are magnetic USB charge cables out there, so glue in the C end and done...
Graphics card?
Only if it's going to be available in Pakistan 🥺🥺🥺
LOVE this idea!!!!!!  I'm not buying another Macbook.  This I would buy.  This is what I've been waiting for.
Best line. "Go have your iphone, I dont give a shit"
pretty good
ok but that laptop is fat tho
Finally an proper laptop. Customizable and repairable. Linux support out of box? I want one.
HOLY MOLY!! I'M SOLD TOO!!!! LINUS I HOPE YOUR STAR POWER IS ABLE TO KEEP REAL ENGINEERS EMPOYED AND DOING THINGS THE RIGHT WAY AND LOVING IT!!!I'm hoping this company grows and grows and stays true to it's roots! That's a rare thing these days, but I have a good feeling about Framework! :D
The biggest, toughest argument I've dealt with against these devices is "ordinary people don't care about how the sauce is made." Trust me, you may not care, but your repair technician definitely does. They will thank you for having one of these, and you will benefit by having a computer that will last you a lot longer before it reveals any signs of old age. And you do care about having a working, performant computer. Otherwise you wouldn't keep buying the next big thing every couple years after your current one breaks down or starts getting sluggish. Now instead of doing that, you can save money and the environment by maintaining and upgrading your existing device instead.  I hope Framework stays in business, and grows to the point other companies just have to copy on their footsteps. Or at least people realise the game manufacturers have been playing on us all for the last 20 years, and law gets made that prevents it. It's already happening.
This is awesome. The only issues I see are the lack of a numpad and dedicated GPU.  All the current models are limited to Intel integrated graphics. Hopefully those are something they can work into future designs.
This laptop is literally the opposite of a Mac, my next laptop is definitely going to be one of Framework 😍
Could i plug my RTX 3060 into this and play games of it???
John 11:25-26 25.Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 26.And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? Mark 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Acts 2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. May Father God bless you all in our Lord and Savior's name, Jesus Christ, amen.
Finally
I'm actually tempted....
Me: *laughs in thinkpad*
Microphone switch? Heh. That can't beat my wifi switch on my lenovo g560 from 2010.
This is legitimately awesome. I'm about due for a laptop and am heavily considering this!
No GPU on this thing?
My broken rotator cuff got a heart attack at 1:38
Imagine if you drop the laptop and it falls apart like legos lmao
wow, this is awesome, this is literally doing everything opposite to Apple!
BUT LINUS, LAPTOPS AREN'T MEANT TO HOLD WATER! That's what water bottles are for from LTTStore.com
Haha I’ve heard that one before “looks angrily at alienware 51m”.
auto switching on when plugged in is awesome, ive a remote controlled plug, so I can just get comfortable hit the button, switch on, boot up, recharge or run off the mains, then switch off, monitor the battery life, leave it pulled in. But this laptop looks legit, as soon as I heard about their idea, I was really interested and hopefully in a yr or so it will be my next machine. I hope this company does well and I hope ppl make some crazy unique designs with cad layouts for the motherboard
Hello
touchscreen laptops are stupid :)
in order for this to replace my surface pro lte it would need - well the cell antenna.
Wow, this makes stealing shit so easy.
did you buy, or sell the segway to the sponsor?
Pretty much sponsored by framework... "Fully upgradeable future proof" how can a removable usb slot makes this a future proof lmao... New gen cpu, gen 5 ddr and gen 5 ssd laptops are coming soon for around 1000 to 2000usd. So this laptop with gen 11cpu, 4th gen ssd/ram is not futureproof at all as those important 3 pieces are not upgradeable. Not to mention 1000, 1500, and 2000$ models with no gpu is pretty much plain sight rubbery. Linus overselling this garbage he must have gotten a huge paycheck. Hence all preorders until 2nd batch already sold out because of this video. Linus comparing this framework laptop to macbook anti consumer no right to repair is correct BUT all windows laptops are repairable and replaceable so the right to repair is not issue at all because it is not macbook. Wifi problem, ram problem, screen problem, IO (usb, hdmi etc) problems, battery problems, ssd problem are all replaceable/upgradedable (size/perfomance) so it's pretty much the same feature on framework laptop minus the modular IO.
My current laptop is holding out for now,  and can't quite justify dropping the money yet. But as soon as I entirely relegate that thing to being a pure linux box, this is my next laptop provider. I am more than behind this and entirely sold. Competitive with ready made solutions and configurable with modules to boot? absolutely ready for this.
That part about patents at 15:25 is probably going to be one of many ways the sleezy lawyers at the other companies are probably going to choke this fantastic proof of concept.  Will support once an ARM/AMD core version comes along the way, hopefully itll be around long enough to get it.
i want one
Now we need one with a gpu that can do cad for those eng students
Nice one Linus, nice one indeed! "Not possible to have elegant and repairable device.. Look at this BEAUTIFUL macbook" Made my day! xD
I love this. I look after IT in a firm of around 100 people. Being able to keep machines in the field for longer would be great, and being able to easily swap out a keyboard or battery from on the shelf spares would save a lot of time and money.
Very interesting.
OMG OMG OMG OMG LMFAO!!!!! @ 2:19 🚨it's like a fire siren.... a little teeny tiny siren🤏
Can it run games though???
Fantastic work by the Framework team! I would really like an AMD CPU version, oh and for it to be available in the UK.
What an amazing product 😍
The transparency of this company is legit amazing, hopefully it gets a lot of investment
Dammit Linus I just bought a laptop and but I really want this one I hate these companies for not letting us replace whatever we want
Im so glad to see this I remember having to replace a fan for my hp omen laptop and having to search for that shit and found some sketchy shit on aliexpress it worked but it wasn't a good experience.
LinusDropTips 8:18
"Cry me a river, Linus." - I get why Linus is mentioning it, but boy I feel Alex on this one.
5:25 reminds me of the old Thermaltake Level 10 PC case
This seems too good to be without a catch
I really love this, I hope they stick around, live up to expectations, and be succsessful! This is the type of thing I like to see
rip off
This video sold me. Hell, the thumbnail almost did. Definitely picking one up when they're available.
in short... apple still sucks
I got so annoyed seeing this right after getting an M1 MacBook Air lol
This laptop is a gimmick and a scam and makes no sense and Ill tell you why.  1. no one wants to upgrade their laptop if they are in the market for an XPS. The people who want to upgrade are PC gamer types who want to get all the performance possible and like to tinker.  2. people who buy laptops dont want to tinker and dont want to touch the insides, thats the entire reason they bought a laptop and not a desktop  3. all laptops today come out with all the ports youd ever want already and youre constrained by the protocols on the board on which technology you can use (displayports, thunderbolt).  4. for like 1500 dollars the amount of performance youre getting is trash, mediocre, and you could just get a more powerful laptop or even a macbook that outperforms it easily, which would save you any "upgrading" in the future.  5. this is just a buzzword laptop to pump and dump their company as channeled through reviewers  6. No gpu.  7. laptops arent big and giant anymore because they dont need to be. believe it or not there are still MXM swappable GPUs for laptops that are modular.  8. I can tear apart my Dell with no fear of losing warrantee and upgrade the drives, ram, clean etc. They also include detailed instructions on their own site  9. expansion slots for different ports are dongles...  10. All of this expandable nonsense looks like a compatibility nightmare. whats going to happen when I want to plug in my RTX 3080 through thunderbolt 4 dock and it refuses to work with all these passthroughs??  11. I can just sell my laptop for half what I paid 2 or 3 years from now and im halfway to upgrading to an entirely new system. No old scratches, or having to order a new battery and board and flash firmware or reconfigure/install windows on my old machine..  12. having parts outsourced from other manufactures like the keyboard isnt new. my laptop has a board designed by CherryMX. The wireless is Intel. the screen could be samsung or LG. this is pretty typical.  Overall a pretty smallminded idea if you think about it. Which leaves the only trend with this nonsense is misdirecting the public to make profit instead of making an actually unique product, since 90% of the traits this laptop have it already shares with literally all the other companies.
Wow this product is super cool, and I want one
this is great love what these guys are doing.
Lost points for not having quick battery change like old phones
This is fantastic, and I want to support this company. I would much prefer to invest in the stuff I have rather than throwing it away. I hope as they grow, they will offer refurbished or used parts to help reduce their eco-footprint even further.
It’s only laptop I buy from now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is how everything should be designed - with serviceability in mind. Unfortunately, this kind of product will never become mainstream because the average users will never be informed enough to pay for design but will be fed enough advertisement to pay for marketing.
Only intel, I'm not going to buy...
Is there an RTX 3090 plug in module? :P
God damn that's great. If they could manufacturer upgrade motherboards to support new hardware it would be so awesome. Keep the same chassis, reduce landfill amazing.
Man, If I needed a laptop right now, this would be it!
A laptop that'll make Louis Rossmann cream his pants.
Holy shit  Thats awsome!
"We haven’t opened ordering in your region yet, but we’re looking forward to getting there! We can notify you when ordering opens:"  Well.... Why they hate Mexico so much
It's repairability through modularity. The question is can you swap out a basic chip on that motherboard without it disabling itself. I bet that you can.
TL;DR It's integrated Intel graphics. The people who actually want an upgradable rig are not going to pay out the butt for something that can't even get 30 FPS on any mainstream games. Only the most diehard of the repair/upgrade crowd will buy this.  Now, if they come out with modular GPUs that can plug into this on the board itself? Then I am 150% in.
I really want one of these but they need to make a workstation version of this for my video and graphic workflow... I need more powerful gpu and thunderbolt expansion module which would then make it possible to use a EGPU..( I assume that this will come) as well as the ability to add possibly  2 64 gb memory cards for a total of 128.
I'm absolutely sold on this. Preorder happening now. Thanks for shining the spotlight on this guys! No idea how long it would have taken me to notice this was an actual thing worth having.
Yay exactly what I wanted, a laptop that comes with DONGLES instead of just having all the ports I wanted pre installed.
11:34 Why does he hate on Adele? :c
The all qt code thing is very Scigi tech. Just hold over your scanner to get repairs started. Very 😎 Fujitsu notebooks actually kinda suppoet the same in an Ultrabook design. The longer I watch, the more I want one.
Oh how I missed seeing Linus rant.
I would love to see Framework release motherboards, so to upgrade the CPU, you just have to take everything out and swap it onto the new board.
I love this idea and i've been following them for a while, but my issue is... will this company exist in 5 - 10 years time?
I know it's not meant as a gaming laptop, but that would be great for them to do! Have a bigger one with some sort of graphics card module or something. Or maybe an expansion card that allows an external card. These modular builds are right up my alley as a gamer!
Now make one with dedicated graphics, or ability to slot in a new mobo with dedicated added in.
After a bad RMA process I had with G-Skill I would never buy their products again.
The activate windows 😂
Why did the editor do Alex so dirty like that....
You're funny man 😂😂
Been using a surface pro 3 for so long. This video convinced me it's time to get me a laptop!
Wait wait so with this laptop that we saw in this video, I can upgrade my GPU AND CPU? Which is not possible in any other laptop so far in this world?
Is there an option for a framework Windows 11 where you can decide how you want your taskbar?
problem with most modular tech ideas is that everything is like hot-swapable
Activate windows
might replace my T430 with this
That only looks upgradable untill there is a leap in USB technology and the ports don't fit. You would be changing all the components out. It's like the old "only fools and horses" clip "triggers broom". https://youtu.be/LAh8HryVaeY
Eluktronics has laptops with upgradable CPU
Props to Framework. Great product construct, but totally random: would they ever invest in a modular gaming/workstation variant of the Framework laptops?
I remember when a kickstarter (or maybe it was gofundme? cant remember) tried to do this with phones back in like 2008
A video of Linus lowkey saying he wants the XPS 15 to be even better lol (typed on XPS 15 9510)
im in love!!
Im so sick of my piece of trash macbook i spent a fortune on. Definitely considering buying this for my future laptop.
Framework laptops, finally modular upgradable laptops for the future!  Can't wait :)
hell yeah
I'm totally getting this laptop
@framework Make something a little thicker with a higher end gpu and you get my money.
How come you don't do videos on dildos. They're tech too...
Need smaller battery and 2,5“ case and a german keyboard?!
When they offer UK keyboard layouts I'm buying one
I think its pretty fair to say, that this company actually solving a problem, not enventing one (like most others) and also, for the first time in recent years, facing thier users, not showing butt
Please do a 1 month, 3 month, usage follow up.  This is so amazing, I need to know more.  Please and thank you.
What about software? Is the firmware open source?
Best laptop ever🤤but i wish it have a good graphic card for gaming🥺
But could I buy just a new motherboard to put into my still-funcioning frame?
And the Darwin award for 2021 goes to drum roll 🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁............    All who bought this framework laptop.  DIY Base model i5 11th gen 816$ No ssd No ram No dedicated gpu No windows Gen 4 ram gen 4 ssd (soldered like cpu) Not future proof since cannot be upgraded to gen 5  *If you want gen 5 ssd and ram in the future then you need to buy again the new motherboard base model 800$ for i5 lmao Gen 5 ssd/ram laptop are right around the corner maybe later this year or 2022. And we all know the price trends for every generations of laptop starts at base model (not gaming and no gpu) 700$ that's a fully functioning laptop with everything new.. So framework laptop is rubbing you at plain sight.
I hope this modular upgradable laptop scene is like the Desktop PC market soon would be awesome!
11:56
There are labtops with upgradable cpu tho and also gpu
I have to admit I love the idea of buying one shell and upgrading the guts later myself when stronger processors and graphics cards get released if it saves me a considerable amount that is.
Cool I have to say.
I really hope they get dGPU's on there by the time I am due for a laptop upgrade.  100% going with this company for my next laptop.
Damn. This video is basically a “God Of Tech” certification award to framework for their innovative concepts and engineering quality.  “I’m barrack o’Linus, and I approve this message”  Big claps framework, big claps. 👏🏻
uh oh and reading their site, Arduino compatible port????
I've been widely mind blown how difficult it is to find a laptop with a hardware mute for the microphone over the past 10-15 years. I'll definitely be looking into this, if only for that one reason much less all the other awesome things they've done with this.
Can't change the GPU. Useless computer.
For the GPU, i dont think they will sell it as different pieces as the mainboard. And do intel & AMD still sell socketed laptop cpu?  if gaming is ur things, i believe that Steam Deck + Portable Monitor way more affordable for portability.   799 for laptop that has ability to be relieble for few years, not much tho.
great! I hope, that idea will be still thriving when I will be going to replace my Ideapad 720s in a few years in the future
Soon, someone will make a reliable plug-in gpu for this.
I bet Woz already bought one of these
Dang, I'm impressed with what Framework is doing. I have an old ASUS S46C laptop from 2013 and I'm considering replacements for it in the next two years or so. A laptop by Framework would be amazing, but it's a shame they're still not able to cater to gamers who want strong GPUs just yet. Releasing a gaming line-up with 15" screens and fully upgradeable CPU/GPU parts would be great. That and introducing a way for buyers of the base model to use an external graphics card would be nice. I just hope Framework will still be around a couple years from now.
9:25 white one here <black>. black one here <white> good thing they wrote all those instructions on there
My next laptop will be a Framework.   sadly i just bought a new one a few months back.  :(
Their response to how they will remain profitable was implausible. A generic “direct to consumer” approach is gruelling for something like this, and there seems to be no sign that they have captured the needs of a good growth niche. This is a classic mistake for a product that seeks to overturn conventional wisdom.  I wish them all the best of luck, but with a heavy heart, I honestly cannot see it surviving.
Please, if you do any Linux videos do it on this notebook to promote Right to Repair Movement!!! <3
Now will this run Windows 11?  I could use this!!!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
All laptops should be like this.
I'm pretty sure the G.Skill cabinet is a 7 sided design.. 5 sides, one top and one bottom.. makes seven!
Holy crap I barely watched this video so far and I'm already extremely tempted to blow the money on this product and support this company in hopes they keep doing what they do, even though I already have all the hardware I could ever need haha. This whole design philosophy is exactly what I've wanted for years and to see it actually come to fruition for once amongst the dozens of other startups in the past, I'm absolutely psyched for this. Even still, I love building desktops and now I can finally put together a freaken upgradeable laptop like this? 10 year old me would be begging my parents for this until they either put me up for adoption or empty their wallets.
Watching Linux install the SODIMMs, which have little snapping hold-downs... Why don't M.2 ports have that? They could be placed at the end for long M.2 cards, or could be placed at the sides, so they'd work for both long and short cards.
What about gpu?
I have never seen a computer (or any product in general) amaze me this much. I absolutely love how customizable the IO is.
How to fard?
Technically he sold the Segway to his sponsor
Do you fard?
Computer needs change. Now your PC can keep up.
So great!
I'm SOOOOOLD!
So, I'm not very smart about these things, but that seems absolutely AMAZING.
Now make a convertible and I'm sold!
IMAGINE USING ONE OF THEIR USB C TO whatever for a phone or steam deck.
Shit..... for the first time in my life I want a laptop
The spiffy wallaby immuhistochemically spoil because algeria radiologically burn round a cheap spider. axiomatic, salty sunday
His segways are like a bad joke mama joke
What happend to the GPU?
11:55
And it comes in a plain recycleable cardboard box?!?!
"Doing something good for the consumer." *Apple left the chat*
I would gladly sacrifice "sleekness" or thinness in a laptop for the abiltity to swap components. The ability to be able to upgrade a GPU in my laptop would be great.  Not all of us are 90lbs weaklings who can't handle an extra pound or two.  Having a nice light machine for basic tasks is nice, but having a powerhouse I can carry around with me is something I would also love.
Yep thinking im gonna get this for a laptop. Really hope they release a gaming version. That would be amazing.
I wish they had a 15 inch version 13 is too small for me personally. Great idea and I will be keeping my eye on this.
i bet in the future you can order touchscreen displays and new motherboards with new processors just plug and play then use the old motherboard for like an sff behind your tv with a wireless keyboard trackpad combo and boom in 10 years you still have a chassis you love and 2 or 3 tvs with older computers behind them so you can do whatever you want. no worrying if your backlight is compatible or if the tv version of an app or roku version has issues like so many of them do
This is, by far, the sexiest laptop and THE MOST compelling laptop I have ever seen in my entire lifetime.
"they got a strong framework" 😂
magnetic connectors with power and data are already available on amazon so yeah magsafe your old
at 9:04 he says "Chassis detection switches", maybe that's the answer to my Lenovo 20235 model detected as "INVALID" as it knows I run the computer without the case and use it as a PC (the case is cracked from a motorcycle accident). In "hardinfo" it shows "Lenovo INVALID" though I never modify the system firmware
sitting here with my thinkpad t430 thinking if we were forgotten.
Finally something well engineered with some sort of upgrade ability
WOW. Sweet laptop, for sure. 😍
Great concept, I hope they succeed!
System 76 Framwork Laptop soonTM?
Perfect. Now just we just need to show that this model can work and google can bring back project ara
11/10 I love this philosophy of actual value, openness and customer support.
Holy shit... I need one
THIS is how laptops need to be why get a laptop that only has some features and not all your features. If I had the money I would buy one right now, However I would like to see ryzen and possibly a bulkier model with better cooling/maybe more space or other cool features.
it has a windows logo on the gui key so it’s bad
If they make a 15,6" laptop with a good screen, a fully clickable touchpad that you can click in every corner with a Ryzen CPU I'll buy it.
Hi, this seems like it's going to be my next laptop. But one thing I didn't fully understand is, do their upgrade modules all use TB3? If so, are they single or dual PCIE Express lanes? Basically I am curious whether the laptop could support an eGPU?
Framework seems fantastic! I'd like to highlight that in the mobile phone world you can have something similar with Fairphone. They are also awesome!
I like how Linus is somewhat rough handling the notebook, passively demonstrating how durable it is.
Make an amd ryzen option and im sold.
lets not forget about the reduced ewaste since if something breaks, you dont need to throw away the entire fking laptop and you can easily repair it yourself.
Epic
If they shipped to europe, and if I were in the market for a new laptop right now, I'd buy this in a heartbeat.   Modularity like this should be mandatory for hardware manufacturers.
What the heck. Why would I buy this awesome piece if it costs me the same as the price of an i5 laptop in my country.
me, on a Dell
if they can make them parts cheap enough to shy away 3rd party manufacturers, and endless future support, i say they can last literally forever.
I mean... in the worst scenario, if frameworks close... you will locked only with the i/o modules, still keeping many upgrades features. I think this is one main reason why some previous attempts to make upgradables laptops has fails: you can upgrade, but only with ours proprietary parts.
Would like to see the expansion cards to hold multiple usb ports. Something like 2x usb A, 2x usb c, usb a/c+micro sd, ethernet + usb c, etc
Funnily I got a Dell ad for the video and linus goes ahead and take a shot at dell
i was drunk when watching this ...
imma buying this right now!
Well done Framework, brilliant..!
People that care about the advancement of tech are going to buy these out of principle lol
wow
With so many upgradable parts, being able to replace the whole thing, isn't it gonna be like the Ship of Theseus?
That must be the coolest Laptop I've seen ever. That might literally be my next Laptop
Anyone want a balance audio plug extension card?
im a desktop man but if the time calls for me to get a laptop this is the laptop im getting
My next laptop is here.
Now there just needs to be a model wide enough to include a numpad and they'll have the market boxed in.
GR8 idea, I hope it catches on and isn't a one time gimmick.
looks so slick
Just remembered this https://youtu.be/x7rt6BZYscs, this one is a better approach but then again it seems there is not going anywhere in near future
OK where is the graphic card
Awesome! What about gaming performance?
It is such a fun activity to skip all the adds baked into the video :)
This is the laptop of the future that everybody wanted we need this company to beat Microsoft and apple and all the other shitty companies
So freaking cool!
Do they plan to do a gaming version?
frame work make a  gaming one
I want one !!
Love it.
This if fking amazing. I'm in love with this company.
Gonna have to do a bit more research of my own, but honestly the next time i'm buying a laptop i'm probably getting one of these. This is exactly the kind of stuff that is needed in the electronics industry and who knows, if these guys do well then we might be on the way to getting replaceable/upgradable CPUs and graphics chipsets in laptops. Plus they come with the added benefit of not having to give money to Apple or Dell or Lenovo or whatever, which is a massive boon. I just hope that it catches on and doesn't sink.
The little modules are interesting, but I wish they had made them a bit bigger so you could do stuff like 2 USB A ports in one module or a USB-A and HDMI in the same module or probably even more useful a USB-A and USB-C. I also don't like how they are your only option for IO and power except for a headphone jack. I think it should have two hardwired USB-C ports (one on each side) and then the expansion slots. They also need to do an ethernet module.
Can you give me 4 gb ddr4 2133mhz laptop ram for free??
I can't wait to hear them release a gamer version that's a little thicker but offers graphics card modules too!
If I had the money, I’d be sold
My next laptop will be this, good on you guys at Framework, I don't want an intel chip but I'll support this kind of work and ethic.
Only reason it wasnt introduced sooner is people accept what these people tell them almost every single time. I mean look at your average iphone consumer. They are the most braindead of the bunch, they happily buy the exact same phone every single year and just throw money at the company. Its the braindead ones that ruin progress like this because their is no demand.
This looks really really nice! Probably going to be my next laptop, I just need a nordic keyboard, I can't be bothered to deal with the tiny enter key.  Edit: It actually looks like it might already be planed as the gap between enter and the key above it is actually not part of the aluminium frame, it is part of the enter key mold instead. So it looks to me like they already plan on a keyboard option in the future!
when framework joins german market, I will buy. Period.
This laptop is exactly everything I could want. Cannot order yet in the EU :\
Now, they just need to make a heavier duty version of this that can support top spec swappable CPUs and GPUs. As long as it's less than 2 inches thick and 5kg in mass, personally I do not mind.   NB: If a 5kg laptop gives you pause,  it's called a GYM, use it.
The one MAJOR problem with all of these up-gradable laptops is that you can only upgrade them as long as the manufacturer makes the non standard upgrades for it. And most of these companies are too cheap to even release BIOS updates 2 years after building the device.
this is one of the coolest things in technology I have seen all year
I immediately wanted to buy one but unfortunately, they don't sell outside the US and Canada yet. Hopefully, they will soon because I really love the idea they have, but not only that but also the implementation. Why make it hard when it can be so flippin' easy.
The openness of their design is going to open up the market of custom laptops for “The Average Joe™️” if they keep on delivering. I can technically aleady see the group buys for custom keyboard themes and chassis designs in the foreseeable future.
I think this company has an ethos that could have them going very far in this business. This is the kind of laptop a lot of people want and I bet there are even more people who will want it once they realise such a thing exists. I'm definitely interested in getting one when my MacBook reaches the end of its life.
Those expansion cards are really cool but not well designed. They should make one with two USB c in it or a USB c and micro sd together or USB c with micro HDMI, you know where I'm going...
If I could get this with a dedicated gpu just so that gpu accelerated programs ran a bit better I would get it in a heartbeat, doesn't even have to be powerful, just something (gtx 1050 in my lenovo is just fine for that job for example). Having the ability to just carry around those expansion modules for whatever port or storage you may need is amazing. I am always bringing a dongle and an external hard drive around with me when I need to use my laptop and this instantly fixes that need.
I hope they get new keyboard module with big sensel touchpad ,a touchscreen display and an new motherboard (12gen) to linus to make an update and upgrade video
The company will be bought and destroyed by a larger manufacturer/provider.
Huh, isn't the ports actually USB4 because it has 40Gbps of bandwidth
Not a laptop guy, but that's a sweet piece of tech. I wish they had a gamer version that switched the battery for a discrete gpu. I mean, if you're gonna game you're gonna pull the watts, might as well smell the roses and go AC right away until they figure out fusion batteries.
For the magnetic connector since it's just a type C could a volta cable work?
Awesome!!!
This is exactly what all companies should be doing for laptops and even phones.
This is exciting!
Lsptop is not that affordable, but love the premise.
I'll be impressed if any new usb-c modules are ever released
I wish them great success with this. Tech world has become such communist garbage where everything is locked, isolated, proprietary to a point where you don't own your device, but merely rent it for a while.
Did anyone else notice the damage on Linus's phone?
FINALLY MODULAR LAPTOP
Okay...this is actually cool.
2010 linus would have had touch on there before the video ended.  Just saying. not to knock on you or anything, just observing aloud.
I wish I saw this before ordering my $700 laptop last week !
Now if they can release this in ISO UK that'd be superb.
if i was in need for a new laptop, and had the money to ship it to Denmark, i would buy this in a heartbeat! It's perfect for school! I would configure this with an I5, 16GB RAM, 500GB SSD, and add USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, DP,  and a 1Tb storage card and this would be amazing!
One thing that I wish they did different - having two of these modules with no gap between them. Like - have some sort of rail on the top and bottom, so it's secured, but don't have a complete wall between the modules. That way they could make bigger two-slot modules containing at least 3 IO ports. Like HDMI, RJ45 and a Type-A could use one bigger module, having 3 ports in only 2 slots.
This is amazing. I can't wait for some other features/modules though: Yubikey, NFT and RFID reader, AMD processor, different audio jacks.
Ok, i  want this,  now.
11:53 is worth the entire video
Something I'd really like is for one of the ports to be Thunderbolt or USB 4, so that the only thing that technically can't be upgraded is the CPU.
I just made a configuration on they're website and it was between 600-1300 cheaper than a machine from asus/microsoft/acer.
Serious props to Framework. I'm actually excited to see where this takes them. I've never actually been excited over a laptop but hot d**n, that is a nice product.
i hope they make a gaming version with hefty vents to deal with higher temps - ID love one to replace the laptop i use for VJ'ing - I have to hit the gpu hard for 8 hours straight and getting rid of the heat means "normal" laptops that care more about being small cant cope
I have no need for a laptop atm but I'll keep these guys on the radar. They apparently aren't shipping to Europe yet but if I need to buy a new laptop in the coming years these guys will be on my top list! Also...we need an optional low profile mech keyboard and a gaming option
Ahh, I really like this laptop, but a few things I am on the fence about.   1) Thunderbolt I would really like at least one of those to be thunderbolt for docking/external GPU purposes.   2) Ethernet port, This one I am not too worried about because my bet is it will be a module sooner or later. But I personalty can't have a laptop without it.   3) Touch screen as Linus pointed out.  But honestly that is it. And 2 of those 3 could be added later.
what an amazing product idea. i'm hoping for a discrete GPU support, ryzen CPUs (7 and 9) and 17" display the most. i know they'll have to include an additional fan for that and complicate the build, but if they can do it.......
The antithesis to the McBook lol
I also use a wired mouse! HIGH 5!
100% apple is gonna zuck it and call it revolutionary 🤦‍♂️
You can upgrade CPU by upgrading the entire mainboard. Looks like they'll maintain fit so they can be endlessly upgraded.
2:3 screen, what a perfect GBA emulating machine!
the day this gets upgradeable GPU option into these this can be huge!
I wish they would go back to socketed laptop CPU's.  I enjoyed getting a cheap second hand laptop and then upgrading it with the best CPU it would support.
Okay, some critics here. First: this laptop is FULLY proprietary. Only one small company in the world can produce spare parts for this. I bet that if they can change RAM module into "unique" proprietary shape they would do it. And because that startup small and unreliable you can't be sure that you ever will be able to get upgrade parts. Second: because of modular design all I/O ports is same size independent of their functional density. I'm personally want to have at least 4 USB ports, Ethernet and some video output at the same time. But It only have 4 module slots that take a lot of internal space. Third: all this "magnetic", @only five screws" etc in my experience leads to unacceptably low level of reliability. Magnets is bad because they will catch all magnetic crap from outside. If any of five irreplaceable screws dies this laptop will fall apart. After year or two you can expect a lot of gaps everywhere.   But in summary, this is pretty cool thing. Just a toy for enthusiasts, but still cool.  Not gonna look into it until Framework reaches at lest some level of stability.
Please bring it to Singapore!
Power On on AC could be useful when running the motherboard standalone as a desktop or server.
Correction: Is there a 4 TB3 /USB4 in the future? That might make it work for me? Just found on their website: standard USBC with USB4 spec So TB3? With how many PCIe lanes? anyone know?
Honestly I'm freaking sold. If I had the money right now I would be putting an order in for one!
WHERE IS YOUR ESD WRIST BAND!!!!
Time to make one with a dedicated gpu
I believe Apple doesn't like the idea.
@linus if they crack the replaceable GPU and CPU then they are on to a winner
But could you add an eGPU or USB-C Video enclosure to game with it?  Just curious if it could handle 4K gaming on a big monitor?
Wow! That may be my next laptop.
This is the coolest laptop I have ever seen
The whole Apple owns the patent for magnetic DC adapters has always disgusted me. They didn't even come up with the idea! They were first introduced for use with appliances like kettles in countries where earthquakes are common for safety. How they were awarded a patent for this, I have no idea.
This is great I would definitely back this it's something that we should have always had. Can't believe we haven't had this sooner should be standerd.
A few years ago a seller on newegg falsified the information about what was inside one of the acer predator lappy’s i ordered. It turns out it was less than half of the hardware they claimed to have sent me so i sent it back. I’m tired of people trying to say there’s something inside that’s not there.
what about graphics
I want one now. But Spanish Keyboard is not even on the upcoming layouts list...
They could make huge money by selling personalized panels, even just with the colour juste the facts you could choose the colour you want would add a lot buyers and make their products different from other ...
This is so brilliant.
Linus- Linux confused 😉😗
Screws! No glue!!!
Can we take a moment to appreciate how DavidTennantDoctor-ly he reacts when he first sees the laptop?
Same shit different angle of view! What's the difference between this interchangeable adapters and Apple adapters? Apple or this Framework,at the end of the day you are using some kind of adapters anyway! What's the point?
Why would you unbox a laptop in the kitchen? *Confused*
Very reminiscent of a really old chunky hand-me-down laptop I had as a child where there was 3 slots which could take a battery, HDD or floppy drive in each.
ehh I mean idk if I gotta drop 1400 for worse performance than a m1 MacBook air for 900...not sure I would get 500 dollars worth of value getting a few more years out of it with worse performance. Cool idea ,but cannot see myself buying this first gen version at this price
My next laptop is a framework.
I WANT ONE!!!!  THIS NEEDS TO BE THE FUTURE
This is an absolute joke.  1) Is this marketed for business or for home consumers? Clearly not business. 2) how about you do the same tests like you would with any other laptop manufacturer? Keyboard flex and lifting the lid with one hand? 3) Framework is all engineers clearly, that do not understand business. This product is a show of their engineering but has absolutely no future. 4) People aren't going to be swapping out from mini-DP to HDMI daily, or switching on a daily basis which side USB is on. Give it a break. These are gimmicky "features" on a budget laptop.  The reason other larger manufacturers haven't perused this upgradable way is because it doesn't make sense anymore. If people stopped buying shitty macbooks or non-upgradable laptops (speaking of HDD/memory) and put their foot down, maybe that would be enough to push some kind of change? Look at the Lenovo fanboys and their push for the classic keyboard or requests for trackpad improvements. Change can happen.  Watch, this product will be forgotten about once your other brainless videos are released. People are barely going to buy this product because it's a shitty laptop with upgradable memory/hard drives and proprietary stupid USB connections.
At the price points they offer, this would be a perfect dev machine workhorse for me..  On their site, they even say they've tested the hardware with several distros of linux and have guides.... even windows 10 with WSL would be a solid option..  and as I need to expand my hardware and change out modules for different situations, the flexibility is amazing..
First laptop I've actually ever been excited for, or cared about.
This is fantastic. Let's hope this is the start of a new trend
Unfortunately, no GPU options.    Yet!
I'm team dodad-majigger.
but Linus I already own 20 laptops .. do I really need another?  let me know when riscv is ready
5:46 - There were options already, even standardised: PCMCIA and the successor Express Card. Sadly both are pretty much dead.
as soon as these become available in europe im buying one, guessing next year. starting to save right fucking now.
Cool new laptop Linus: screwdriver!!!
I see Linus' phone has been thoroughly Linused @1:58
Wonder if it's possible to add a gpu in the future!?
Woah
This is too sick
Calsburg don't make laptops....but if they did....
Thats a nice fkin laptop
Awesome!
Great product!
Plot Twist : Framework is the sponsor of this Video.
Now this is dope
old devices had schematics on the inside of the panels ok they are not like a laptop its a bread toaster but its more then 40 years old and still works my dad had to put some new wires in it and they still use it it works very good but it shows how things changed now its hard to find good documents of the stuff you are fixen cars and bikes etc
'Apple!, Dell!, no sleeping in class! Please take note of this.'
I want one.
Well guess its time to replace my Acer Aspire V3-771G I've been using for the last 8+ years lol
This is a game changer.
Oh my GOD. I just had an issue trying repair a cheap asus laptop I had. I guess I'm going to be saving up for this, because this is amazing. The POSSIBILITY for different types of connectors is just perfect.
Just wait for Apple to buy this company and KILL it just like they did with Beats
This has to be the most positive review I have ever seen in my life
IF this company still exists after 3 years i'm totally gonna buy only these kind of laptops anymore
LINUX but hardware
This is a great product from a great company, I hope they stay afloat so I can eventually replace my laptop with this
I'm sold and about to order mine
#33 on trending
It’s weird but Linus looks younger with a beard
I’ve officially mastered. The Segway skip.
MacBook good ending
Dude, that looks like the best laptop webcam I've ever seen
This should be Holy Sh*t video. Now they should make a phone. And then a smartwatch with Paul
This laptop is so good I'm going to cry 😭
Nobody else thinks that needing to get a USB-C  pass through to just charge the device is kinda dumb? And it takes up one of your ports… just make the internal header replaceable/make a small power only “dongle” slot, to keep it replaceable without taking up space.
When are they going to do this with cars?
Framework: In People, We Trust!
These guys need to pair up with Sensel.  Linus, why aren't you showing Ubuntu running on it?  Come on man!!
USB-C is only OK. Until the connector on the laptop breaks due to wear/tear...abuse? I have been seeing many laptops at work where the USB-C connector failed.
please let this be the future of laptops...
i want so see a laptop with full desktop gpu port  not just these m-gpu ports
Okay, sometimes you can tell someone REALLY likes a product they are reviewing and this is definitely one of them.  He freaking buys one in the middle of filming. Literally can't get a bigger seal of approval than that.
Now I really want to get it even I don't really need a laptop...
11:53 is when Linus sees a sale on sandles where you get a free pair of socks with each pair of sandles you buy
This gonna be my next laptop.
Definitely like this concept why always creating more and more electronics wastes and i can even see a future up-gradable mobile phone in the future as well.. imagine you just have to replace one component to make your computer a new computer you dont have to replace the whole computer once you buy it you just replace the component inside without buying another computer but as you can see we are all guilty to accept this obsolescence we all creating  tons of wastes that wont be usable in a couple of years and i laugh when i see a green activist with a iphone in their hand and have a 50 inch tv screen and have wireless earbuds with no replaceable battery the problem around the pollution is largely created by us as we are all guilty we are the one who can change these old and bad mentality of replacing everything by something new we could just upgrade it !! WHY NOT !?!
All the modular pitch and cpu soldiered on...
Super cool seeing someone do this design philosophy and do it justice
STARTING AT 1000$!!! No way. Too expensive. US and Canada, just wait when they are going to be shipping those pcs in Europe, taxes and everything... No thank you, i'm going to buy a mid range windows pc or something
Good video.
Framework vs M1:  if I go M1 and something goes wrong, I'm f$$_cked  If I go Framework, I'm covered
THIS is the future of notebooks right there! Hurry buy Framework stocks! its like apple at 10 bux a share!
I want version 2 that has a few more upgrade possibilities.... Keeping a close eye on Framework for sure
This was too stressful to watch... Seeing Linus slamming and mishandling the poor thing all over, just waiting for it to hit the floor... Kudos to Framework, btw... 😂
No AMD boo.
11:52  My wife Had to check on me.  Well Played Meme Man.
Does it have a separate GPU? .
If framework makes one with a dedicated GPU my wife and I are in for 2
Linus, in Brazil there's a laptop with desktop processor, that could be replaced easily, It would be really interesting if you take a look on it
11:55 WTF is that?  Don’t put that in the videos.  That noise is awful 😣
https://youtu.be/hPzBmYpyg9s
Part of the reason why they're so cheap is because the company doesn't need extensive customer support / repair services.
I think they should've gone with a gaming laptop instead since thats a market that needs upgrades way more often. Of course that would require them making a replaceable GPU module and maybe a CPU module too so you dont have to replace the whole motherboard like in this case.
Finally....   I'm seriously wowed here.   Next laptop I buy, will be from this company
Couldn’t activate windows lol
Zzzzzz. They can wake me when they have AMD CPUs.
I like it but I also don't like it. I like the user friendly insides. On the flip side, those little modules sure do look a bit... proprietary. When you think about it for a bit, it's not THAT amazing.
Interesting.  Very interesting, to be honest.  Considering adding some wiggle room in the budget to test one of these out at the office.  Wonder if they're gonna make an ethernet module & how many displays that machine could reasonably drive & @ what resolutions.   The ability to purchase an extended warranty (up to total of 48 months) would be nice as well.  @Linus Tech Tips, would REALLY like to see a more in-depth analysis of this baby, and whether or not it would be suitable for small business applications...
I want to see one of these make it's way to Louis Rossmann.  I'd love to hear his thoughts on it.
This would be fantastic for school teachers to use if they didn't have a a desktop available to them
This is too good to be true.... Or is it?  Where do I sign up.... Is it available on Amazon or what. Take money already.
AMD Ryzen with 15.6 inches screen. Make it a respectable screen: maybe HDR, miniLed. I'm in, guys.
I really want this
I personally don't see this being very successful, but it would be neat if it would.
Interesting product, but this definitely proves mainstream manufacturer’s points about not making laptops upgradeable. Not to mention the fact that you’re dependent on Franework for the upgradeable components is a risk and really not that much different than just buying a new laptop from the same brand every few years.
5:20 its more commonly called a serial port
The lack of a video card is what stops me from buying it.  I used to carry an ultrabook but I found that as phones have gotten better most things can be done with the phone or a tablet anymore.     Pretty much the only thing I would really want to do with a laptop anymore I can't do with a phone is gaming.    Pretty much my ideal would be a 15 or 17 inch with a 3060 or even just a 1650 would probably be acceptable for mobile gaming.
Framework is like when your parents want you to take responsibility but at the same time want to make it very easy without directly helping you and I love it
16:17 Wait, that's not a standard thing??? Wow companies are jerks
insted of dongles you'll be carrying modules I wouldn't mind that
to me that doesnt count as a laptop with every mod possible im wondering when they will have some sort of computer it doesnt matter if its a laptop or desktop Ive always wanted to see a computer with all the ports...
i pray for this to become the future.
upgradeable gpu/cpu and 17" even if it is big, ugly and expensive, I'll buy it.
17:37 - Linus is pirating windows again xD
The possessive teller pharmacodynamically avoid because samurai antenatally double above a numberless camel. sneaky,  fascinated surname
linus was sold and so was I, difference is that he has money to be sold and I don't
I absolutely love it. Would like an option for discreet graphics but if they take off like I hope they do I’m sure it’s coming.
LINUS JUST NAILED IT! Cough DELL😂
Technically, Linus, it was G-Skill who bought the segue.
You found my collage laptop, Thanks!
Fuck the M1 MacBook Air. This baby is going on my shopping list.  EDIT: only US English keyboards for now. That's a temporary dealbreaker for me until the ISO layout becomes available.
we need more companies with this thinking and philosophy !!! great product btw :)
This laptop looks really good. I would absolutely love it if this laptop had a CFexpress module I could install.
Shame it's not available in UK yet, but I've signed up for updates! Come on Framework, give us a treat on this side of the pond!
Can they make a cell phone too? Please
If they give me external, fully compatible GPUs I'll buy their entire fucking stock.
This is perfect, I need a new laptop for university, you've sold me on this Linus
i want that sooooo baaaadddd
There's already actually magnetic USB C and lighting connectors that can be bought for like 5usd. Just slips right into a standard port.
Sweeeet   Looks nice I need a thicker formfactor with Beefier cooling (and ryzen options)  but NICE !  this looks amazing
This is awesome. Their website is super helpful too! Their FAQ section literally answered every single question I had. I have been needing a new laptop, this is something I can get behind!
I want one!
Dell offers great upgrade paths: they will let your upgrade your extended warranty even if you don't ask for it (at a charge)!
Wow! The webcam looks better than Logitech’s c920s
~0:40 i though your paid for the ads not the other way around (you pay for making sagways)
I don't think I've ever cried looking at a laptop before
Linus do a sudden movement , everyone nervous laughs
Would love to see a follow up to this video in a couple of years time to see how many things Linus swaps out or changes and the product lines that are available, imagine a Naruto keyboard
you know it's good when Linus orders one on the spot
Are they going to add graphics cards? Because as an engineer working with 3d software id definitely prefer that option
6:07 Secrecy breads corruption!
Digital Equipment way back in the 80's made a desktop that was upgradable  The CPU was on a daughter card which could be simply swapped, so in effect, the motherboard was upgradeable across CPU architectures  What killed it was they increased the price to cater for the upgradeable aspect and that was the death of the idea  I'd happily buy an upgradable laptop
I have never, I mean never wanted to buy smth from a sponsored video. But damn dude, this, this is smth else. Props to frame work
Could have done an upgradable cpu too, the chinese do it by soldering the chip to a pcb with pins so it can go on a socket  Would make it chunkier but more upgradable
*Sarcastically watch this from a touchbar Macbook Pro*
That's it, I love the laptop, Next goal of my life- Convince my parents to buy me one
$1000 for integrated intel graphocs? That is not affordable.
those modules need to be locked into the laptop and only open with password otherwise it is very easy to be steal
This video is candy
This is really cool and I hope it doesn't fade into nothingness
So usb dongles are “replaceable connectors” now?
I think it's a mistake to aggregate the upgrade paths within the company. They would be limiting their growth potential and more likely stay a very niche product. Instead, they should become a platform, where others pay for licenses and extra support to create an even larger ecosystem of upgrades and accessories. To use Linus' example, Framework could only do so many anime collaborations by themselves; but it's way easier for them to license compatibility so that any company can create anime themed upgrades, opening the door for more anime collaborations and, therefore, more customers!   The beauty of the platform model is that it goes well with their overall philosophy: a platform creates more money for its suppliers than it itself captures. It's an open ecosystem!  I think a product like this will always remain somewhat niche, but opening up to other suppliers sounds to me like a better way to faster and more sustainable growth.  Either way, I wish them massive success because we do need more companies like Framework!
*finger's crossed" pls don't be a scam. looking forward to framework laptop. not all heroes wear capes.
maybe they should also have thick laptop choice
This helps people actually get into the IT world.  Suffer....
Already seen it, Dope
Apple and Microsoft want to hold back our future so they have control.  I’m all for some hacky dude creating a magnetic connector.
The 90s called. They want PCMCIA back.
You could install you OS on the removable storage unit and then just plop it into a desktop's USB-C port and boot it here as well. Same environment everywhere and should be plenty fast.
Isn’t all of this Linux real state?
Cool laptop.
So expensive
Regarding battery disconnect, although it's not the same, thinkpads have a similar setting, to disable charging the battery. You can also configure it so that it gets disabled at a certain charge threshold
I personally don't mind having external GPUs as long as they did the job. So this would work for me. Kinda looking forward to see more customizable options :)
I'm not in the laptop market at the moment but this thing is pretty sweet!
If this has good Linux support it would be a boon for the Linux community, those old easy to repair thinkpads are showing their age. If this company is really open libreboot support would be nice as hell.
this reminded my of the phoneblocks thing, what happened to that?
"where else am I going to go?" Haha, such Naivety my little grasshopper, wait till the thing gets popular and the chinese start developing knock offs and spare parts then I'll show you a whole bunch of places ppl would go to get their "anime keyboards N' stuff".
I want to see this running a Hackintosh! Bet it runs at par with Apple + is customizable! WHAT WHAT??
Good laptop pog
imagine everyone uses this and u just pull up to your friends house with your steam library in you back pocket
The website actually addressed the CPU upgradeability stating that you can swap the mainboard out for one with a better CPU if you so choose
I’m going to get one. Even with the modules it comes in just under $1000.
I don't know if other manufacturers do this but Dell does at least in its business line of laptops have BIOS options for battery usage patterns and charging options. No disconnect option, but with their branded power management software you can set the battery to hold a specific charge range when on A/C power. For instance I have mine set to about 50% so even though I use it on A/C power 99% of the time, the battery is always held around 50% charge. I can go change the setting if I know I'm going to need to use it on battery for a while and the battery is in excellent\new condition that 50% charge is more than enough for quick usage scenarios where I need to be mobile. So that is pretty handy, at least for caring for your battery.
do they deliver schematics for diagnostics?  Schematics or die! ~Louis Rossmann's cat
I don't see GPUs unfortunately. I figure integrated graphics would be passable for the stuff I'd want to play on the go, but I'd like to have at least a decent GPU option to have a more robust gaming laptop. Not necessarily VR ready or anything, but at least something that I Can run games on moderate settings with a smooth framerate.
i wanted to order one, but there is no options for black keyboard faceplate and eu charger. I also wonder can we use external gpu ?
I’ll throw out my MacBook when the hackintosh community hacks this bad boy.
ifixit made a better video that too 6 min long 😜
NEED AN AMD OPTION! The concept is fricken awesome but I'm not buying a 4-core laptop in 2021. The "bring your own" option is amazing too. No need to buy yet another windows license.
"There just should be other options" - you mean, like every other phone?
I hope they use this laptop to take it to court and sue all the companies that don't allow repair or upgrade ability. I hope one day this becomes a trend and I look forward to companies who are this innovative. The only problem I see is that it's probably not going to do well and people will continue to buy Apple products.
they should have made the slots a bit wider so they fit 2x USB-A on them.
Well, that's gonna be my next lqpto02
Domo Arigato's name is covered by suggested videos (on mobile at least)     Edit: you think I got the name right the first time???????
You may also want to mention that those little ufl (micro fl) antenna connections are normally rated in the single digit connection cycles. Not knowing exactly which connectors they use, I would assume less than 10 cycles on those connections unless you can get exact specs. from the manufacturer.  I may need to hold out until they have discreet GPU.
There are like tons of youtubers spending thousands and thousands of money on improving their setup and adding lightings to their unboxing video and there is this guy who is literally unboxing his laptop in his kitchen..lol..😂
Would be great if you could get a Thunderbolt 3 module for an external GPU.
Oh yah, I use a Volta magnetic charger thing, it's good
AAAAMAAAAZINGGGGGG! So cool, everything about this is so cool.
they literally just made this to impress Linus
yeah lacks a bit of dynamic range and is soft (I mean, this is in excellent studio lighting conditions) but wow!! in that size, on a laptop? that webcam's amazing!! :D
Finally, an open-source laptop
Looks great
The Steam Deck and this is getting me SO EXCITEDDDDDDDDD it's such a wonderful open-source feeling :D
This is brilliant and is making me want a second laptop just to support them.
Truly Awesome! That's an often overused being applied appropriately for one.
Linus just made them Rich, because I know for a fact people like me are going to buy these forever if only due to the fact that we can upgrade it.
the way he handles electronics gives me heart attack....
Yesss !!! The future it's here !!!
I love how they literally went "fine I'll do it myself"
Ask Steve about Dell, you'll get looong sigh.
I AM BUYING ONE WHEN I CAN AFFORD IT! I just hope they ship to South Africa too
For thinkerers I can imagine a module with GPIOs from an arduino or even a rasberry pi :O holy cow. Or or or or an RGB LED module.
Why are you so clumsy.
1:38 - He's learning...   I mean it's been a while since we watched him drop something.
I absolutely love this
soooooooo how's the GPU? ;)
Mb your 🤪 always dropping krap hands🦴 can not, but I can . That other krap we won't buy . But this sounds good. Like Gen3 and on...
Dang I only use a laptop for gaming but if i used it for work/office id get this right away too! This thing is sick!
I've been trying since seeing this video to order. They show stock available, "Ships September" but when I add to cart it's "Insufficient stock for this order"?  Dangit I've been dying for a laptop like this for years and my current one literally just died.
If I drop this laptop I may need a screen replacement but that’s it something I can do in under an hour   But with my 2017 MacBook I got keyboard issues and it’s now unusable it costs more than the device to fix
"not repairable" yea cuz apple makes them to be unrepairable
if they had dedicated GPU that would be a killer laptop.
Nice machine, and the fact that MS improved Windows 10, I might just order one for personal use
I've never seen Linus this happy opening a laptop
Brilliant. Screw Apple. Hello Framework 😃
nvidia arm please
This is pretty interesting and user-friendly to end-users! I can't wait to get a hold of this one next time!
Gigabit lan module?
I hope they bring a German keyboard layout soon. Love this thing.
When they have an AMD option, I will buy it.
at first i don't think it's real... BUT IT IS!!
God I would love a keyboard layout with full size up/down arrow keys
If only there was something like this at 15" with a numpad - been really uncomfortable for me when using smaller devices, to the point where the smaller laptops I've had have just ended up being paperweights that I leave at home as I don't want to use them.
how good is the keyboard for writing?
I WANT
My Dell still has another year of life left on it but when it's time, I'm getting this. Hell, if they release a Risc-V version, I'm buying one even if I don't need a laptop :D
can you get one with a touch screen
So its like a 2018 thinkpad
I hate laptops. I would rather work on desktop at home and tablet on go. Make this available in India I will buy it without a second thought.
Dunno WTF is wrong with their website, but it reloads while selecting expansion cards and makes you redo the entire configuration over and over
If I  hadn't bought a new laptop last December I would get one of these.
Would love to see them come out with a gaming laptop that has upgradeable CPU and GPU, I think that would be a legitimate game changer.
The way linus handles this laptop puts the fear of God in me. Please linus, PLEASE be gentle with this amazing piece of technology.
Linus appreciating the laptop  Me having a anxiety attack that he will drop it
Man this is best laptop i know,
THAT is progress! It is not to make more obsolete to make more fine and pretty...    The Macbook Pro 15" matte screen before retina remains much sexier in my eyes than what we have today. I installed a blu-ray player on it, and it works very well!... Details I always admired in Macs of this era, between the elegant battery level LEDs, or the almost invisible white activity indicator when turned off and whose very organic "breathing" animation has always fascinated me since I discovered it as a kid.   Soldered storage is so ridiculous when you realize how lucky you are to have such a compact and widespread standard as M.2.
This is really impressive, I know where I will be buying my next laptop. I really hope that these guys are successful, I want to see a workstation/gaming laptop from this company.
Watch this company get bought out and deliberately run into the ground by a company like Apple.
thinkpad t430 is already that  and better
It's nice to see transparency and right to repair coming back to products.
I code all day. I think this is what "love at first sight" means.
Full review please. I too am interested
VERY interesting. I am willing to suggest this to customers easily.
why on earth will i pay 1500 Can  for an intel processor ? whatever the good idea and the advantage of the future upgrades may be . It's like creating a lada that you can upgrade with a lada engine, you are still stock with a lada !!  I can see this be extremely advantages for business if they provide cpus that do not suck. the i5 1135g7 is like 50 % slower than the equivalent of amd and thats just one cpu. How can you review a product without putting any importance on the lack of power of the cpu options. Let's wish you got payed well.
16:16 Yeah, it saves the battery. But one of the pros of using laptops is you shouldn't be worrying of sudden power outages, which you will if you disconnect it.
17:01 Linus offended for not being able to do the dad joke.
Weird that they went for i7's  with no GPU option seems like i3-i5 would make more sense.
Amazing video! Well done Framework
I m sold too
If I wasn't so into OSX, I would really consider this
i want to buy this
Can't wait to see Steve get this.
Just need to add GPU expansion modules and you will sell these things out like hot cakes. Love the concept and hope they succeed!
will windows start crying for activation once Motherboards and CPUs are upgradable?
Right to repair is have your current iPhone if you want but when you break that damn display you go into the apple store and buy another display and keep all the functionality of the device.
3:2 aspect ratio are really rare. And this has full scale upgrade options. I say this is the best tech enthusiast product anyone can buy. Ryzen options would be cool as well.   This has to be really marketed well. I see a lot of potential in this
this is what we've been after, but let's face it.. i can't see this lasting long i hope this comment doesn't age well and that i'm wrong.
I looked it up and they didn't have a dedicated graphics card. For me, that's a no deal.
wow that looks super modular and easy to work inside, yet also be a nice looking sleek modern package from the outside. It's noticeably thinner than my dell 5410 which doesn't have a replaceable keyboard without ripping into the entire system board. Edit - I'm just waiting for the Ryzen release at this point. I'll buy a Zen with GPU the first day they of availability hah
I've no need for a laptop but if I did this would be the one I would want. Nice video, and nice reference to Right To Repair I'm sure Louis will be happy :D
This will be my next laptop within the year. hands down. amazing!
If they had convertible 2-in-1 models, I'd buy one right now
Industry hasn’t get it that the mission is to switch every port to usb c thunderbolt not to use those ports to put and hdmi there 🤦‍♂️
I would really like if they make more kinds of frames suited for different purposes and keep making for modules of the new hardware that releases.
You obviously need an indian for this
Now we need upgradable gaming laptops
I'm sold!
Could just buy a 2nd battery :P and perhaps 3d print a small external carry case for it.
your sponsor does some nice ram but suck at software
I like it. No, i love it. BUT: it's way above my budget :(
You guys need to test the TB with external GPU.
wow he really just ordered one on the spot huh
The battery switch should be a HW button on every laptop ffs! 👍
your channel now is just a QVC channel. you are just a effing sellout to companies to sling whatever they give you . you are not like the original IT info days anymore. you are now just a QVC hag that is just there to get money and push out as much trash videos and merch as you can.
The concept of this laptop it's just awesome. The only thing I would add to this it's just a dedicated GPU for all the gamers out there.
this is amazing.
Polite correction. "Battery Disconnect" is not a "Plugged In" mode. It's there for servicing. It internally disconnects the battery so you can safely open the laptop, replace parts, and all the other fun stuff. It switches back to normal mode as soon as you connect external power again. It's also used when they originally ship the computer to you, due to certain shipping restrictions on devices with integrated batteries.
the thicc MSI laptops has changeable gpu and cpu
The best kick in the balls to the big selfish greedy giants... applause!
11:30 Wait Dell promised that? Does anyone have a link to the article?
i love this. if they branch into desktop replacement tier laptops. big and beefy with high cooling and gfx cards but with these same principles. i’d only ever buy laptops from them again going forward. and so would anyone in my fam (which is everyone) who expects IT support from me  this is absolutely amazing and i can’t wait to see where they go with it.
Nah, I will go with Lenovo X1c
Replacement parts is a big thing... The post sales support is minimal right now and if you didn't order it with the laptop originally there isn't a way currently to order the parts separately.  This also includes if you break your screen and you need a replacement.  The only addition that I would like to see is something with dedicated graphics cards.  The ability to buy a machine with a last gen GPU and upgrade later on would be amazing.  Many times that is the upgrade we all want and never get with laptops.
Linus is a confirmed Weeb
Now give it to Anthony to install alternate OSes on.
Please let these guys delevop gaming laptops, I for some reason perfer laptops over towers. Imagine you could just plug one of those USB c with a graphics card way. I just respect this company for the end user friendliness. I would love if they would also made it to ship with Linux or any os you want. But yeah I really respect this.
Now if framework invent a surface book that can use the keyboard to boost graphics, battery, and ram but with the portability of a tablet that can become a fast laptop
I was about to order one thinking that I won’t need dongles like with most other modern laptops. Finally a laptop than can replace my 8 year old one that still got all the ports. Why do they only have a MicroSD card slot and NOT a full size one :(  But let’s see how things are when they make a 15" version.
Will consider if: 1. My current laptop has died. 2. They offer AMD variant. 3. A little cheaper please, hopefully they can lower it down when they mass produce.
a bit like fairphone, but fairphone is quite expensive for its spec
"they got a strong framework" hahaha
Those bottom lips are for the vent on the bottom and wtf are the specs and other io's. You didn't say if the gpu was upgradable i have so many questions
I bet framework is stoked about this video
I want to invest. Please don’t let the flame die out! Someone send this laptop to  Louis Rossmann
Is the GPU upgradable?
And I immediately ordered one! Bye, bye macOS and Windows; hello linux
I am just a bit curious about the tpm situation of this laptop. with windows 11 requiring it as a default setup what happens when you replace any system module?
1:58 Samsung
interesting why fairphone didn`t get the idea of a fairtop,... repairable and even upgradeable
Is it OK to say displayport or displayport port?
Their website is pooping itself right now which is a good sign that people are grabbing them quickly. I will probably get one in the next few months once my finances settle.
I do not remember where they said it in the video, but when i first heard, that you save money if you choose the DIY edition (correct me if i am wrong) I went to the website immediately and tried to put one together identical to their pre-built offering. Guess what it was a whopping $17 cheaper to go DIY route. I think there will be very few people that wont pay $17 for pre-built if that is the difference. I suspect that $139 win 10 home is probably the culprit.  Edit : 2:30 is where they say it.
i swear the content linus makes its just getting more and more useless to the point where hes opinions arent even worth anything anymore. later click bait commercial channel
Awesome video was waiting for this for a long time 🙂🙂
i frikin love this thing it looks sick
the most amazing part is that i can put my charging port on the left OR right!! and change it at will!
9:40 Be very careful with these ... Also : puts the white cable on the black one’s place ..  yeah linus remind me to listen to u next time
2006 Intel Common Building Blocks all over again... Guess what, it failed :)
Can you swap out the GPU?
I need this
my dream laptop
"Activate Windows" 17:16
I want!
It's about time
I do like this concept, but I'm skeptical it will go anywhere. Giants like Apple and Dell already have enough momentum and market influence that tiny companies like this will likely have little impact. That said, I hope I'm wrong. The last major repair I did on a laptop was replacing a liquid damaged macbook keyboard, and by the end I wanted to shoot myself.   Obviously car companies like Honda and Toyota can still produce profitable vehicles that are repairable by users and third-parties alike. Consumers and hardware OEMs have allowed these dogshit, disposable products to dominate the market. If we actually bought into companies like Framework, perhaps the tide could change.
You're wrong linus, ever heard of the steamdeck?
those like me who doesn't want to replace their machines because of fucking super glue added in the parts to hold them forever this is the go too device
Im happ seeing this linus vid
This is dope, hopefully they still around when I'm shopping for a new laptop in couple years or so.
Yo this is dope!
I…don’t want to pay for Windows. Can I send back the license and get a refund?
Had my eye on this for a bit and you know what.. This looks way better than I actually expected  Update: Doubt anyone will see this but ordered one now they are in Australia!
No AMD, no Linux, disappointment on that regard. Being a developer and self respecting person, Windows is a no go for me. Had enough. Intel, I don't trust them anymore, plus they suck.
Can you try out some Linux distro on it? You mentioned that the power button/fingerprint sensor has Linux drivers so I'm assuming good things.
Never thought i would become one of those tech fans for a company but they end up making me one with only 1 product.
I'm mainly looking forward to when they start releasing RISC-V motherboards. It'll be super interesting to finally have a laptop running the arch!
i miss 10- 12 lbs   thick laptops   ,, imagine what you could do today  with all that space
For the same price, you could get a Macbook Air with the M1 chip. Why doesn't Linus compare the M1 chip to Framework's laptop? They are in the same price bracket.
I know that I will be using my laptop plugged in all the time, so I directly remove the battery from my laptop
11:53 best effect ever
12:45 linux drivers for fingerprint sensor ?  Where is the referal link? I need this. If it only would have ryzen 5x cpu....
No, thanks. I'd rather stick with Apple. Framework is not going to go far. Most end users just buy things for them to work, they don't think about repairability and upgradability. Framework's product is a niche product
frame.work could totally make a thicker version that has better performance and cooling capability, while allowing for more modules to be attached at any given time who knows, they could make a dedicated intake and exhaust port arrangement, and the motherboard could be replacable when a new CPU is needed, or a GPU is included or omitted axial fans seem to always be better than blower-style, they are quieter, they can push more air, and they come in many form factors, the only downside, and the reason why laptops use blowers, is how thick they are... its more efficient to have a super thin blower than a super thin or small axial fan, or fans, but if you can make the exhaust at the back have 40mm fans... you could even have modules specifically designed for cooling, ESPECIALLY if you design some sort of quick-disconnect and flex-tubing water cooling setup|  for the motherboard, they could have a generation 2 device could have pre-arranged ports that interface with some sort of "distribution board" that can allow for different positions of data connectors, but power can be spread out over the board, and it increases the mechanical connection to each part, but the main reason, is that it would mean that said board could allow for different board designs, while keeping the rest of the device the same, and using off-the-shelf components at the same time, including some sort of special connector that could be over-engineered to allow for different flex cables and sizes of screens, as well as ways to interface with them (maybe the screen could be set up to be like some sort of "external display" so you could even use it separately, should you lose interest in the current device, while allowing modularity)  or, since its supposed to be basically open-source, some of these things, you could do yourself
All of this while considering it's the 13-inch model I'm really quite impressed. The webcam is also better than pretty much anything I've ever seen. Definitely buying it soon, they deserve that success!
1 want a 15inch version of this! With dedicated graphics card 😬😬
Sell your GameStop shares and invest/ donate the money to Framework!
They were so jazzed and used all jazzed up parts they got me all jazzed.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!😁
https://www.frame.work/ It has to have the ( www. ) in the address Same I would think for that twitter address you will find on the page with the wrong address.
Please deploy The Anthony to test Linux compatibility.
Framework is doing what Android did, make it open-source, customizable, and affordable. and Android became a huge thing, I have high hopes from framework aswell.
impressive.
Tempted to buy one
It doesn't have MacOS. I'm sorry, but Windows is very inconsistent with their UI/UX design. Stick with Apple.
My Dell xps13 can only have its ssd upgraded.
One of these and a Fairphone and I'd be quite happy...unfortunately both not [yet] available in Australia...
I damn well hope they start shipping internationally soon because I want this so damn much  Upgradable, customizable & affordable?! Triple fucking threat and beats out all the other laptop vendors
Those excuses NEVER held any water,
So because of the TPM requirement on Windows 11 do you think the modular design would cause issues? Because it's tied to the hardware right? I hope not because this thing is so So SO SO! Cool!!!
I am not Technically savvy but do these plug in components open up a whole new world for plug in destructive hacker components that are a one time hit and run ?
I need help. Around 9 months ago I bought a RTX 3080 MSI gaming x trio 5 months later I got a message that Said "RTX 3080 MSI gaming x trio is no longer available, but you can get å refound, or choose this RTX 3080 MSI gaming z trio instead" I accepted the offer. Recently I tried to find the card online, but there was nearly no information on the card. One of the only websites i found it on was msi.  I was starting to panic scince msi was claiming it was the best nvidia based gpu of 2021 and I was not able to find any reviews of people testing it. Does anyone know why a gpu like that hasn't been reviewed by anyone or are so hard to find online? And if you where wondering if I bought it from a fake website. I bought it from one of Norways largest tech stores online  I also think it is really wierd that I only found 5 starratings on the card while many more should have given it a review.
"Not a ton of dynamic range"... it's the best webcam in a laptop you guys have reviewed in a while ....
Linus coughs: coughs out dell😂😂😂😂
Inb4 some big company buys them off and shuts them down.
bro if you can buy so many computers and laptops what is even ur gaming pc?!?  if u have one
This is pretty cool, I'd like to see linus using this because if it turns out not to be a flop you sir have my attention.
Absolutely smashed it framework, if these work out I'll never own another brand
First
everyone please support this company. we need to reward those that actually listens to consumers and have they're best interests in mind.
Linus: *builds a 20k pc Cool  Also Linus: *laptop comes with screw driver Hhaaa
The site overloaded lol
What happens when you need more ports at one time than is available  back to a dongle now if they just provided a dongle that magnetically stuck to the back of the machine or actually plugged into one of the ports. Laptops spent 99% of their life sitting on a desk or in a bag anyway.
Hands down. This is the best laptop I have ever seen. Definitely gonna buy this. Congrats Framework. You guys are genius.
I've never wanted a laptop until this moment. Holy fucking SHIT it finally happened
You overloaded frame.work home page !!!!  :)))
Their website is down due to high load and is under maintenance. is everyone buying one of these?
Is the website down for maintenance for anyone else?
This is amazing, but has a very niche target audience - tech geeks. Your mom and dad consumer who buys the bulk of consumer technology still won't have the tech literacy to take advantage of the benefits of this device and would be paying the premium for this device for little to no reason. I'm hyped, but this isn't the future of mainstream tech.
It's a really nice product for a person like me, but I'm worried the company wouldn't survive the industry for me to buy into their products.
Yeah I'm still sceptical but the usb-c links to the modules make the motherboard upgrades pretty straight forward for them. They just build a new one with same 4 ports inside and it'll fit, and then they sell you that (maybe even with a trade in program).  I'm just not sure if 4 ports is enough (and it's not something they can just add more now)
Ineed that laptop 💻
Lol their server is down due to this video.
The only setback is not having a GPU, even a soldered one. I guess it can rely on an external GPU via thunderbolt, if it has thunderbolt.
Don't really need a laptop, but I was thinking about getting one anyways because I absolutely love this concept. Aaaand of course their site has been hugged to death.
I love how their website is down for maintenance right now because of high load. Linus has truely spread good word there
Not yet available on my side of the pond, but I'll definitely be keeping an eye on them.
Yes!
Lol the framework website is currently under too high of a load. Good job Linus.
Honestly I'm sold on the 1 TB hard drive. It's enough storage for all the games I play and when I'm not playing games I can just swap it out for something else.
Nice catch! Your improving!
This company WILL blow up
i think we broke their website
Too bad it's itty bitty small  Big is better if you can't lift 5 pounds off a desk go get a gym membership.  Screen Size is everything. 21" laptop would be great..
Linus: "They simply cost just a fraction of a cent ....." Beancounter@BigCompany: "Hey my job is to save it" Engineer@BigCompany: "yeah thats why our products suck"  BigCompany = Dell, Apple, Lenovo....
this is soo cool my laptop screen was broken when I had it and i had to plug it in to a monitor to use
Having seen this it makes me more annoyed at aple and co for what they do to block out the consumer
I don't like touchscreen laptops. The only computers I like to be touchscreen are devices like the Surface. But that's probably just me.
Yes, other manufacturers have RAM, storage and WiFi upgrade options are very limited in your choice of hardware.
Got a strong framework. herk! :)
Can we please have a ARM version of this please?
Finally, Thank you so much. i wish you the best of luck and ill be buying one for sure 👍
Fix your phone back.
Me expecting a CPU upgrade-able laptop: 🤡   Still a pretty cool product nonetheless.
Remember "Phone Blocks"
What Linus fails to mention is that it's 13 inches and has no GPU, so you can't actually use it for much. It's an amazing PoC, but I contacted Framework recently and they said they have no plans for a 15" or 17" version. I would love to see a more powerful (aka useful) laptop with this kind of upgradability.
let's talk about elephant in the room where gpu
as soon as there is an iso keyboard option I'm pulling the trigger
Only complaint is there is no ethernet slot
As soon as they add amd and graphics card im all in
This product is basically Framework giving Apple, Microsoft, Dell and all other companies like that the biggest finger ever and it’s amazing 😂
i have  feeling that the more people find out about this company and it's very upgradeable laptop it is going to start making some of the other big computer companies nervous. honestly if i was in the market for a new laptop i probably would be buying one of these myself...
Looks freaking dope!
Good thing I find out this exists like two werks after I bought a notebook. Nice.
This Laptop is a dream!!!! Please industry - MAKE THIS STANDARD !!!!  :....)
amazing
When they make a 15.6-17 inch model with a GPU I am immediately buying (pending good cooling ofc).
Did you just say Queuepon here at the end?
Rossmann will rest in peace now
i think the dell PC by 0:9 is looks nice too but maybe not for everyone ^^
hi linus sex tips
Framework straight up went modular laptop and expandable is its passion
This is what the masses need, i love it and want one even tho i don't need it
welp i found my next laptop this is definitely a cause I can get behind
Is it just me or I can't seem to order this because the website keeps giving me an error message....
SOLD
No thank you.
Yes.
Do they also offer matte display?
Man I'd actually consider buying a laptop if I could upgrade them as much as a desktop. Shame there's no AMD option
this is awesome to see from a company. i hope one day they will ship to europe
custom build of the case is a great idea
Actually made me tear up (yeah I am sensitive). Need more product design like this. Avoids so many pains in the ass and so much wasted money.
I'm in the market for a new laptop and the Dell XPS 13 looks really good. It's too bad the framework laptop is not available in my country yet so I have to go with the Dell :(  What an awesome new concept it is. I'll definitely keep an eye out on it.
This is still a propietary design, with propietary modules. It's not open source and you depend entirely on the existant and word of FrameWork. Until there isn't another manufacturer of compatible modules, this is still crap for the consumer. Meanwhile I can get on ebay parts for most hp/lenovo/dell laptops.
Man, waiting for the time when an external GPU can fit in that small modular IO box. Imagine carrying an external GPU around, and swapping it out with ur HDMI port whenever you feel like gaming. And swapping out ur usb c port for an additional fan.
Kid's got big high end lego set
Now this is on my first list to buy when my asus laptop totaly broke. Hope this one is cheap though
It needs to have a swappable GPU
I was like "so what, we've seen mechanical switches on laptops before..".. then I also noticed the clear keycaps showing of said switches.. "OOOoooohhhh!!!" 🍆🍆🍆
Real nice. Love the whole concept
Never before have I wanted more to buy something I don't need based on mission/principle alone
LinusDinoTips 11:55
Im getting this next time i have to upgrade my pc
man you drop that thing and it'll break like lego pieces...
I've been a Mac user for a while now but this is one of the coolest laptop concepts I've ever seen, I hope the company does well
Cpu is soldered on the board, not impressed, sorry. It's just a gimmicky product, nothing special about it.
Clickbait title are just weak tea. You are making a habit of lying
OMG this is awesome, what about a graphics card though?
This looks great
Linus: "this laptop is affordable" Me: *Sees $1000+ price tag* "I dont think that word means what you think it means."
11:34 😂
FINALLY I was wondering when this channel would cover this product!  Fairephone and framework ,  similar initiatives as well as right-to-repair initiatives are important developments that should be supported if we want to have a future full of tech without or rather with smaller mountains of e-trash.
The maniacal step-daughter reportedly interfere because umbrella conceptually scorch pro a stupendous pocket. windy, alcoholic peak
Its been a while since i saw linus this excited for a gadget and yes i would be too. The laptop is frigin amazing 😍
if it has a nvidia gpu, im sold!
This is amazing, the team at Framework are masters of their craft. I think they're onto something big here and i want in!
Wait your battery can swell if you use your laptop, while on charge... Um
IM SO EXCITED
This company desperately needs a corporate client.  You would think it wouldn't be hard given you could now have an IT department that can easily swap out bad components.  I really hope they're successful.  773 people voting this down.  What are they afraid of?  They must be working for the other side.
Im amazed this is priced at 749 / 999. I really thought it would be 30% + higher!
I REALLY HOPE THIS WILL SUCCSEED. IF I HAD MONEY I WOULD BUY ONE NOW
Cost for device and modules?
Haha just a couple of days ago I broke my laptop trying to change the ram. The way the keyboard connected to the screen was so complex and frustrating. This a really good idea and I hope will become the standard
Bare minimum price is $750 this is with out ram, an operating system, possibly a hard drive and more. Way more costly than a standard predate laptop. I hope the price comes down the thought and designs are important more so now than evdr.
i would give a testicle for an ikea laptop
Omg daddy
It's cool but: is it necessary? You can't replace the core parts that make a pc upgradeable, the CPU and GPU, soooo.... you can replace some parts that break. Does that ever happen, reeeaaaally? Good philosophy, but sort of useless? Except for the battery, but that's not new nore is it really difficult to do in other laptops
I hope this project flies in long run! It seems that right now they don't currently sell international keyboards. I'm using 105 key keyboard which non-US-style enter key and I'd definitely want similar key layout (tenkeyless with normal spacing would be perfectly okay though, even preferable). I'd be perfectly happy with all black keycaps instead of Swedish labels that I currently have but I need similar shaped keys or I won't be happy with the keyboard.
How much is it????????
you bet i'm going to wait for linus to get one and see his reaction.
Amazing! I really hope they succeeds.
I'll tell you one of the crazy things for me has been dealing with monitors with HDMI vs Dp, with this I can just swap modules vs swaping monitors. OR upgrading a laptop's ram and SSD can be so much easier than it has been. Ram usually isn't an issue, but for someone who grew up with regular drives, dealing with NVME ssd's has been a hassle with the little screws and those things that hold the drives up. If they can make it easier, more power to them.
Would be nice if the hackentosh Community finds a way To run macOS on it would probably be awesome
GOD please let this become the standard! this is what it was always supposed to be! Amazing. Also please put a Ryzen in there and you've got my Canadian Rubles!!
I usually am really really bored by laptop reviews but this? I was extremely impressed. When I need to get a new laptop, I will look into this as a first go to!  What I would absolutely love to see: a trade-in/return policy for devices that people dont want anymore or are broken so that the parts could be recycled to a max
possibly the best product featured on Linus tech Tips
interest intensifies  too bad they don't ship to Europe (yet) also: an ethernet connector would be nice
This is awesome. Can't wait to get one.
I don’t care about the Specs. I want it.
Hmm, I hope this takes off. I want other companies to go "Fuck. We need to copy this, it's unprofitable not to"
I really, truly hope these guys are able to sell a lot of these, because it would sure suck if their company went under.
Wired mouse elite!
For enterprises with a decent IT department and large amount of laptops, these provide a way to support their own machines. CPU dies? Swap it out, user won't know or care.
I want this thing! I'll have to wait though...
His waving the computer makes me nervous.
You know what? I'm going to say it....... Poggers
this makes me wanna hold on from buying a laptop and wait for them to ship to asian regions! nice job Framework!
It looks like it doesn't have a GPU :( can't be used for gaming.
I Love this thing!! I hope this kind of laptop becomes standard!
i wish they'd resume Ara Project for Phone Sector
imma buy one if they use thunderbolt instead of usb-c 3.2
After this video, this laptop sales going throu the top. Love this laptop
Okay damn that webcam is crazy good, my external webcam is worse than that, let alone my laptop camera. Please let this company still exist in like 5 years and above, and they can expand to Asia so I could actually buy this thing
You should do the most expensive PC unboxing I love to even get a PC me and my family don't have the money to get that much stuff
This reminds me the Soviet-era electronics in my country, where "service manual" often included complete wiring schematics. As much as I hate that period of my country, this is one of the few things that I would like to return in some form.
This is actually amazing
i heard the word "anime", i press like.
Linus is so happy! 😊
People i need help. Im building a rig for workstation (mostly photoshop and some 3d with blenders) and gaming and i can't decide on gpu. My budget allows me to get either ab rtx 3060 or an rx 6700 xt  maybe i could get an rtx 3070 or 3060 ti. Cpu is gonna be ryzen 5 5600x in a x570 mobo.  Thanks in advance!
Y’know I kind of wonder if a gpu as one of those little modular chips is possible
16:35 HP laptops, for example, have power on AC too
the rossman wet dream
Not for me but rather cool
Now they need to jump on Steam Deck train and come up with their design.
Micro transactions in a PC! Woohoo!
If they ever make a desktop or a mini itx style desktop I'll preorder one immediately!
I mean I do appreciate the ads for this fancy gaming stuff, but for frick sake I can't afford that stuff
Really enjoyed this, I'm not a laptop guy but if I needed one I'd definitely lean towards one of these now
Do those external GPUs work with this thing??
I think this video cause the website to popular that the servers went down cause of how busy it got
This needs to be shown on all the tech channels and rossmans channel.
This is definitely my jam.
When linus started dissing the XPS 15 that hurt me because I have the xps 13 and damn I want this laptop
props to framework for doing something different, and smashing it, better than a lot of other laptop companies  Edit - the more i watch this video the more i am genuinely impressed by framework
i'd have loved to see a Ryzen option, but this is pretty neat
OMG, this is awesome, I hope that enough will be bought, that they could release new modules, mainboards for this laptop latter, this is the only risk I see
gimme
It'll be cool to see Ryzen and possibly integrated graphics. This is the first generation modular design but it's pretty great as a start. It'll be cool to see the modular io be consistent between generations (hopefully)
That's sick. As a multimedia designer and gamer having an upgradeable laptop sounds crazy appealing.
8:17 I haven't seen Linus dropped anything in a long time, until now. That's a comeback.
https://youtu.be/XkYQHJq81to
hint= linus promoting only framework laptop
Aren't those standalone GPU thingy also uses thunderbolt? Doesn't that mean one could also hook it up to it, basically gaining a a good gaming experience at home, the flexibility of a laptop, and the modularity of a PC, all in one high potential package?  I hope they reach Asia. I'm buying as soon as they ship to my place.
Waiting until AMD CPUs are available.
I went to the website to put a DYI bundle together because I was so excited by what this company is offering/doing with their laptops. I got to the end of the customization and to the part where you put your deposit in, thought to myself “what is missing here”… A GPU, I may still purchase this laptop just to support Framework, but a GPU that could be upgradable would be a nice have as well - I’m kind of surprised that Linus didn’t say anything about this, but then again this is kind of marketed as an ultra book. Maybe they’ll make a gaming laptop for the line-up later on.
Niiiiiice) Please consider using a microphone next time ;)
i want this! as soon as there is an AMD version i will buy it
Wait is has power pass through?! How is this not a standard?! I've been asking for this for years! So many of my old equipments can be turned into security cams, emulation stations, and other random smart functions had this been an easy work.
linus forgot that the biggest part of upgradable products disappearing is corporate greed. Why let someone fix something they already have for cheap when you can make them rebuy and new one or offer to repair it for the same price as a new one lol
Another product that's great on paper and probably not gonna sell
THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN DREAMING OF ABOUT LAPTOPS FOR YEARS!!!!!!!  A COOP FIXABLE, ADJUSTABLE LAPTOP!!!!!!
Ok boys I'm sold. Now two things: ship to Australia, and expand to gaming laptops, then you can have ALL of my money.
About time!
I am actually sad that I dont need a new laptop right now. This is exactly what I would love. And I worked for apple in the past and really like their products too. But I am all about repairability when it is done in a way with careful thought and great documentation.
Hello dear, can you please review the Xiaomi Notebook Pro X 15 - i7 11370H - 32GB/1TB - OLED? Is it really a flagship killer?
Only Intel... Sad face.
Its the beginning of an era
Why does this laptop remind me of my current gaming laptop? Its nearly the same thickness with (I think) replacable cpu, nvme drive, and ram. No clue about the GPU.
This is the future
I feel the need to buy one of these now
Aim going buy it
But why not mention the graphics card at all? I can't be the only one wondering if it can game, can I?
Wonder if they'd do a small form factor desktop that uses the same main board, but supports PCIe GPU boards,.. use the laptop mainboard like the NUC compute module.
this is what im buying when my laptop craps out on me.
Talking about right to repair. I can understand that in some places it would make sense to have certain replaceable components that can't be easily removed or replaced, but that does not mean that should be the way for everybody.
It has nothing to do with “want” and everything to do with cost. Manufacturers make more money making sure when something breaks it breaks “for good”. Hence, why they are fighting right-to-repair tooth and nail.   If you think it can’t be fixed then you buy a new one. Thats what they want you to think.
i wish more youtubers and influencers go for it , so that we have a larger fanbase  of framework .  Open sourced is the future
Linus needs to ifix it his phone, tsk tsk 😨
hopefully this gonna be a standard in the future.... but that hope i personally feel grim...
Can you get Anthony to install Linux on it and run some tests? :D
"Cry me a river Linus" 😀😂
if they sell extra GPU and full fledge fan docking below the laptop, that would be great, and i can choose to carry or not when i need it  its like external GPU but attached to the bottom of the laptop, i dont mind thicker more powerful device
This Product actually has me in my feels, Linus is actually so excited about the laptop. I'm ready to buy one too
7/27 sus
Holy fuck I need this
I don't get the argument that rigidity = higher build quality. For example, airplane wings are deliberately engineered to flex and bend. Having a flexible chassis could allow the laptop to distribute forces better in the case it's dropped. However, it's clear that you wouldn't want the keyboard itself to flex.
How cool is a DIY version! Simply amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have known about this for ages but i am worried about the business side of it. Not sustainable.
I recently got a solid laptop from the Norwegian company Multicom.no, that is somewhat big on gaming computers here. It is very upgradeable with total memory swap up to 64G and with 2 1TB PCIe SSDs and one conventional small 2TB HDD, it can store a lot. 17,3inch display with a swappable GeForce RTX display card and a Intel® Core™ i7-11800H processor on board. No windows installed, as I prefer to install my own. The only thing I don't like is that it runs a little hot sometimes, but it is because it sits on my lap as a laptop should, right?
If you want all that buy a PC. Most people don't need to carry laptop everywhere. Reasently my favorite hobby when traveling is to watch how people are trying to find something to do with their phones or laptops so they don't have make an eye contact with anyone. Hilarious to watch people scroll up and down over and over.. :D
Hope they succeed in building this thing completely.
I've seen less bios options in a desktop... that is an insult... (looks at hp)
On their site, they do mention that you can upgrade the mainboard
If only this had a socketed CPU like ye olde ThinkPads used to... I know neither Intel nor AMD make those anymore, so that one's mostly on them. Still, I'm keeping my hopes up for a next iteration. Also, Thunderbolt would be a plus, as a means to hook up an external GPU
it looks like the chasis is based on the lenovo ideapad 300 series
They need accessories! Like cases and skins!
hes using galaxy note9
wow, consider me a fan as well. I hope to see more of these kind of things, even got me considering buying one as well.
Give me a tablet like a Surface Pro from these guys and I'm sold.
Btw starlabs have similar laptops made with linux in mind. They also run the open source bios coreboot.
Imagine if they released a gaming laptop version. It'll useful since gaming laptop needs more maintances, and even better maybe we can upgrade graphic card without buying the new one (if it's possible).
FINALLY!!
Impressive, but can it run crysis?
invite tim cook to your studio and smack a macbook to his face. perhaps you could bring him back to reality and stop their excuses
Love the product just from the review, love his reaction as well XD
Who thought giving a shit about your users and not treating them like infants was such an insane concept??  Everybody except Framework. Eat shit Tim Cook.
I Thank the lord that I watched this video.
@linusY don’t you design a laptop that can be easily upgradable every way… which you are good at it
18:23 for the last time Linus it's Quopon it coupon
My only issue with this is the lack of an AMD option since they are only using APU's and no discrete GPU options.
We got some Project Ara type shinanigans going on here?
4 minutes into the video i **** already
2:24 the one thing that doesn't work in my current laptop (Dell without extended warranty), and I want to replace... the stupid 3.5 mm jack
9:27 Linus you did what.. put them other way round
how about germany guys?
I can hardly imagine big companies will sell you components for this. its a great proof of concept, but just like most of the modular concepts they rarely see a mainstream success. The truth is every car manufacturer could sell you a non propiertary modify-able car, but they won't because they know 99% of people dont care
Wish I could get the free pair in NL :(
THIS IS THE FUTURE I WANT.
oooo i want one, imma go not take my dads credit card
shame for the weak cpus offered, and intel only. The concept is brilliant and I hope for a next iteration with more cpu (or even an option for gpu)
I wonder if GNU/Linux will run without issues on it and that all the modules work without issue?
The day they add a dedicated GPU option I'll buy the most expensive option instantly.
But what's the point if you can't upgrade the cpu? That's the main reason people upgrade their pcs.
Question is… can you use the screen as a stand alone display for other devices. For example, Xbox/playstation to hdmi INPUT on the laptop to use screen as a display.
This gave me goose bumps.
Can I put a 3080 into it?
its freaking awesome
@12:50 1single iFixitbit of Kolmogorov Complexity?!
No RTX 3060? :(
The manufacturer's release of the motherboard CAD standard to A..  Is it now possible to upgrade a laptop at will like a desktop..
I have my reasons for not buying a new laptop, i'm pretty much always on my dekstop pc, and i use my iPhone in bed for games and watching movies. So there was no need for a tablet or laptop because i'm afraid that for the amount i use it it's not worth spending so much. But the option to buy a laptop for 700/800 euro's without a ssd/ram & windows is really sick to put your own parts into it, i can reuse my smaller nvme from my dekstop and i can get memory from any vendor. The last laptop i bought was a HP Pavilion Dv7 a big fat HP but i used it for 8/9 years. This might be the first laptop i will buy since that model because i like the company, the way they made it for the customer and not the investor. Love it, unfortunately not yet available in the Netherlands tho. But i might visit the US next year might be able to order it and deliver it to a local adres :D Keep it up! Love how Linus ordered it the same day he saw one. Just wanted to say also, that the marketing is a good product. I never heard of this product or company before today, but this review made up my mind. Yes YouTube is a form of marketing of advertising, but producing a good product with a good cause has more value then manny companies think.
The modular io expansions ought to just be captive screws like VGA/DVI/even a graphics card, not with the thumbscrew, but just flush. I don’t imagine people will be swapping out all of them all that often. Maybe only one slot will ever get swapped around.
Its a Lego laptop
im gonna wait till they allow customizable graphic cards
No graphics card? why wanna upgrade motherboard or cpu for internet browser laptop....?
2min into the video and I'm already completely sold on this laptop philosophy.
You could replace Steve Carell in any movie with that voice👍
Everytime I watch Linus I get a little smile on my face xD
11:56 your parents when u meet then at 3am while you get some food from the kitchen
This is maybe the best laptop cameras I've personally witnessed Linus review so far!
CPU/GPU not upgradable. So this is the same as most mid to high tier laptops. Making this a shill video....welp
I really hope this company becomes super successful more than apple
The price isn't bad, $800 with $100 deposit. My 4th gen i3 laptop was about 400 and my fiance's i7 was 1400.
I just hope they'll stay alive until I need a new laptop in like 5 years
Did Linus just pull a Uno reverse card on G.Skill?  *He* bought the sponsor spot for them? 😂
Just buy a laptop with all these things, this is a useless and not worth the money
Now, just add open-source firmware like on System76 laptops and mayyybe the Sensel touchpad Linus featured a while ago, then you will have my instant preorder.
Linus: There are no swappable laptop CPU's to buy Me: Look at my old work laptop from 2008 with a swappable CPU
what about the gpu?
When u get 2 sponsors and ur a pc guy
1. why is USB-C 'Expansion card' is only with one usb-c port? If it is big enough to fit 2 ports... 2. why there is no lan expansion card? Sure you have fancy wifi6, but there is some situations that you need physical Ethernet connection. 3. In configuration it would be cool if you could choose 'none' or lo-mid-hi tier dedicated graphics card 4. Should be able to ship to EU(with eu charger) 5. THEN I'M SOLD 6. additional: It would be cool to see more display resolutions and laptop sizes like for example 13''/15''/17''
Although I know this thing will never make it into the mass market ( Most people just would never give the effort to just learn about the stuff they use daily ) I’m so down with this concept and effort the team made.  Heading over to their site to see how I can support them right now.
I've never liked laptops in all honesty, mostly due to repairing them and the fact you can't really customize them. But after seeing this, I might actually consider it. All though, one question, where are the letters/ numbers etc on the keyboard?
Why would they want the bigger manufacturers to hop on that modular train? If it's that good give Framework their props and push their product.
Wow, finally. Why dis this take so long?
You listed everything but the GPU. Which kinda seems like a purposeful, glaring omission considering they all come with the same, crappy onboard graphics. With no other options.
11:55 I'm dead 🤣😭😂
I swear there was already a video on this a few months back
This company just got the best advertisement of their entire existence.
amazing product
THIS IS WHAT I WANT. I only wish for a good sound and a 2in1 solution.
About time! It's like "Back to the Future" all over again!
As a warranty tech, I see a lot of unused space in the laptops. The board takes maybe a quarter of the space.
Fuck every other company from this point on. All hail Framework
Can we get the ultimate framework laptop
meph we will see how long this will be supported
This much modularity should've been the manufacturer's philosophical approach since ages ago!!... They've all been getting away with murder!😤
Dell will solder the ssd next time and make a comeback with a thinner laptop.
Sir, your phone is broken. Also this is a Wendy's.
My main complaint about the right to repair movement was that they want to force by way of law manufacturers to make their products less tightly integrated. My belief is that if people want to get a product that is easy to repair then they should buy products that let them do that. Companies can respond and create products to suit the trend or they can stay how they are and risk losing profits. Forcing them by law is not the best way to get them to change. Ultimately companies want you to buy their product and if people continue to buy their tightly integrated products then they will continue to make those products. Vote with your wallet. Using a government fist to compel them isn't conducive to innovation. I agree with the intent of the movement, where I disagree is the way to incentivize them to let us have this freedom. Great work Framework you are exactly what the movement needs more of.
The dynamic copper biosynthetically sin because girdle karunagappally match times a draconian jogging. white, careful chair
I really hope they survive! But if I ever get a laptop again I'll definitely get back to this Having a good webcam with a cover and a hardware microphone switch is so nice! And a replaceable battery and wall power only mode should be essentially a requirement in all laptops. The amount of decently working laptops that are trash because their battery is dead and blowing up is insane. And being able to adjust your io to your needs and even encase the mainboard outside of the laptop is really useful.  I hope they make motherboard upgrade packages to replace the module once it's too slow or outdated.  Maybe Linus can actually invest in the company and keep it afloat but reading through the comments I think this community will be a great boost already
I am currently a student in Broadcast Journalism.  This might be a great machine for me since I can upgrade my I/O on the fly, and I can upgrade the RAM to handle video editing.  I may just order one of these in the future.
This company should be at the top.  Eco packaging, user friendly components and upgradable laptop ?  Man, fuck capitalism, give engineers the power.
2010 PIECES OF CRAP CAN BE REPAIRED OR UPGRADED UNLIKE MODENR THIN PC'S. REMEMBER INDUSTRY STANDARD ARCHECTURE FOR THE ORIGINAL IBM PC.. SCREW YOU SAY APPLE.
They have to invest a lot on ads (even on TV) pushing the fact that some companies (like Apple) say they are enviromet friendly, but in reality they creata e-waste, instead Framework really is enviroment friendly and gives you freedom and right to repair. However only with good advertisement more people will know about them.
I hope this company blows up that’s awesome
The irate milkshake distinctly claim because bus perioperaively tie about a melodic thomas. naive, three rain
Nice Video. I remember switching a keyboard on An 17" Acer laptop. 54 screws in total to dissamble the keyboard. Crazy
This is great for those who love fixing electronics but suck using a soldering station 😅
8:17 ah, linus dropping things again.. wholesum
This is so cool! ♥️
this needs amd cpu
Bruh, ima go over and invest my life savings… I just know that they are gonna boom cause they finally gave us a decent product without all the bs
Aw man, looks like we can't buy it in europe yet, hopefully that's just a matter of time though
Can I upgrade my CPU later? Yes! If you ever need more performance in the future, you can upgrade to a new Mainboard with a new CPU on it. We publish step by step guides you can follow to do the upgrade yourself.
This thing is dope 👌 Every 10 seconds my mind says "sold"
Seems like Framework is on the right path
Linus: Laptop CPUs have no pads at the bottom, that's why they are soldered and cant be changed   Me: changes the CPU from his T61 and HP620   Really?
Next time I need a new laptop I am 100% gonna buy this if it's still around!
Linus: "I use a wired mouse, but I don't like the cable"
I need some advice. Looking into saving up for my very first PC. I wanna do it right and build it myself. Which of Linus's videos would be the most helpful for me? I'm coming from a zero knowledge background, only ever owned laptops with enough power to get me through my uni assignments.
This would have been a great idea 5 years ago. But at the moment laptop components besides batteries are pretty good, there isn’t much justification to be upgrading.
I really hope this sells well and Framework thrives. This is great. I am a desktop user, so I won't buy it, but I hope we get to see a Framework phone one day. :)
Can it play warzone?
It's not often something gets a super endorsement from Linus, this thing seems really cool and i certainly didn't expect that price
If it take some skill to repair something anyway, as long as there's no "device lock" on components people do have crazy ways to modify things. (I wouldn't even be surprised if people find a way to bring 16GB of ram to an A12X processor.) And for a consumer product that you likely don't buy extended warranty for, it doesn't matter, just mod it all the way, as long as it's not for the first year. As for drawbacks, this laptop basically can't have 80WH or 100WH battery whatsoever, and port count is limited to 4 (well, 5), which means that you can't get enough to plug a mouse, connect to external HDMI monitor, charging and use LAN network while still being able to plug in a USB drive, as that's 5 things. Up the module slot to 6 or at least provide 2 free (in free real estate) USB-C port that doesn't take up any slot would be perfect. And then, the only question is, is it worth it. It'll really only be on par in cost if you don't go the DIY route (and if you are on DIY route, there likely won't be any extended warranty option available), there's practically no room to fit a high end dedicated GPU on the 15 inch model, and when think of it, comparing to a Dell laptop you really only get the swappable ports, as Dell also allow user upgrade for ram and storage, while offering factory configurations for screen side and keyboard side.
I thought Linus already did a review on this? Or was that someone else? It was a few months ago I think…
The battery disconnect should be on all laptops!. You can even pop out the main board if they release newer version cpus.
Magnetic Type-C cables: Am i a joke to you?
If they are bringing AMD and ARM to this chassis...I am in...cool product. Might have to pick one up to support them and then upgrade to AMD later 😂
You guys need to make a partnership together. You know when something just feels right <3 !! The LTT community will be the marketing driving force making this company a success . GO FRAMEWORK
I checked out the specs on the website. It's better than my current laptop and both less expensive than the sale price I bought mine at 5 years ago plus a lot thinner and lighter. After I graduate I might have to buy one of these :)
I'm buying this.
Linus Phone is cracked :D
I have a question.. If you remove a module, can you plug a USB C device directly into the port the module normally plugs into?  If you can, this is really great for people like me who do a lot of work with the laptop on the move (programming radios) and the cable is plugged in out of the way and protected from being broken off..
Offcourse the big manufacturers doesn want you to uppgrade your laptop or exchange components. They want you to buy a new laptop from them instead same goes with cell phones.
I want one, but with Ryzen please.
The fact that this laptop is darn expensive than even some gaming laptops , its gonna be my next work related one.
if you're looking for magnetic release charging there's a cable that has the magnetic break on the jack
i'm sold. I want this.
I love to see a LatencyMon run test on It. This is my main issue with windows leptops...
Alex: And they also have job openings! Linus: Oh yeah Alex:.......... Linus:......... Alex: !!!!!
Would love to see 17.3" variants with upgradable gpu and stuff
If it has more I/O, I would definitely buy that at some point in the future
Can't wait to see what Linus has to say after a long term test
99% of this has been standard on Thinkpads for literal decades.
Needs AMD tho. Who wants second rate incel processor?
this looks cool as heck. wonder if they would ever do a modular gaming laptop?
How do I invest in this company? Might as well make bank when the big manufacturers buy this company and kill the product...
What do pc gamers and laptop gamers share? They both hate laptop gaming.
thats was  a great video lmao
I like this one .. i hope they sell lots and i hope i can buy one soon
I hope to see this company succeed and be around for years to come as we need more companies that think about the consumer as much a the guys at framework seem to
Is the cameraman drunk?
why make things fixable when you can force them to pay alot to get it repaired do to a flawed design and force them into feeling like the only easy option is buy a new one., companies these days expanding on annoyances for more cash
GUGUGAGA
Which specific version of USB 3.2 is used to connect the modular I/O to the mainboard?
I wish this wasn't limited to Intel.  Love the concept, though.
I hope this comes to the UK and the company has a long life
I love this! Also, that camera was surprisingly clear!
this is probably the first time I've actually wanted to buy a product after watching a video on it
The I/O is my biggest complaint about this... There's 4 slots for expansion but all of them are single. So like... the USB-C port is a single one and so you're really just going from the embedded one to one that's on the edge and paying $9 for that privilege. Why can't they fit in two in that same expansion size? Or even better, have a USB-C port that's there without having to add an expansion module to get it?  And why no Thunderbolt? They're using an Intel processor so Thunderbolt is available and they can just charge a little extra for the expansion module to pay for the licensing. I like the idea and it's much more doable than the module phones that people keep trying. It just needs some more built-in stuff to make it more worth it. And some additional expansion cards too. LAN, VGA, Serial...
Man that is nuts. It's better and cheaper than those Clevo Barebones. If the company stays alive and they keep this up that will be basically the best device you can get in terms of price to performance and lifetime.
It's not that often that Linus presents me with something that I want to go out and buy right away, but I want one of these so bad!
They way he addressed intel was very funny I brust out with laughter...
For a clamshell laptop, Touch is gimmick & unnecessary. Some power users only use keyboard. 😂
1:38 I thought Linus was gonna drop it 😂
What about gpu? In their website, I wasn't able to find anything about gpu.
Alot of you are so confused about this fail laptop since all windows laptop can be upgraded to bigger storage and bigger ram as well, only difference was the modular usb port, hdmi etc. (the IO)  Pros: 1. easily removable module usb a, hdmi, usb c, sd card 2. Easily removable battery and screen (But all windows laptop can be remove) 3. Replaceable front screen frame.  Cons: 1. Expensive 1000$!for base model 2. Expensive Up to 2000$ for 512 ssd and higher cpu. 3. Did not even mention any rtx card at all 3 models. 4. Current gen ddr4 slot and current gen pcie 4 slot are not modular as well as cpu and gpu in short if you upgrade the motherboard it will cost alot since it is pretty much the laptop itself. 5. They dont make their own chip, so all future motherboard with new cpu,gpu, next gen ddr5 slot, next gen pcie 5.0 will probably cost almost at the same price of a traditional laptop. 6. If for example you bought a new motherboard, you are stuck with worn lcd, worn keyboard, old gen ssd card, old gen ram, worn charger and worn or full of scratch laptop frames. For the price almost the same as the new laptop with everything new. 7. Not to mention the terrible cooling system design of laptop is terrible. Look at all the upcoming gaming laptop, they are way better than this. 8. In conclusion this laptop is not future proof, having a module IO will not compensate for the lack of fully upgradeable next gen hardware such as gen 5 pcie and gen 5 ram.
Does this thing not have activated Windows included?
11:57  I cannot sleep now thanks
This is more than an upgradeable laptop. The last company which made widespreaded computer structural design was IBM in 1981.
Anime  Noice
Gamers when their laptop is prebuilt:
If its so well documented, why not fully disassemble the laptop and then give it to Sarah to re-assemble.   Or give a laptop to Sarah and tell her to upgrade it.
That is sick!! Good job Framework 👏👍🏻
I like the idea. Basic pebuilt is priced exactly as basic M1 Macbook Air - Intel i5 vs M1 is no match for MacOS users. Keyboard looks fine but only one choice - I am french canadian and won't buy a laptop unless it has ISO FR-CA layout. MacBook Air has better display (100 NIt brighter). Framework has more ports, fingerprint reader, less autonomy, no SD card module, no Thunderbolt module, is bulkier and heavier.  Do you think you would buy a laptop and upgrade motherboard later? On the other hand, being able to replace a defective mother board after warranty expires is an advantage. I would assume a careful Mac M1 user could expects 10 years of use with battery replaced once and that is an easy DIY repair.  Nice concept, not for me yet.
All I've ever done in my life is 'next, next, next, ok'.
Come on Linus, Touchscreen on laptops is so useless...
2:02 Im more surprised that linus is still using a galaxy note 9
I don't understand, how is that CPU and GPU are weld to the motherboard in laptops?
I can't do with less than 100% DCI-P3 coverage on a display. If a $400 phone can have wider gamut, why are laptops lagging so far behind?
Biggest weakness is GPU, otherwise, his looks amazing!
This laptop is just amazing. I would be surprised if they don't become a billion-dollar company over the next 5 years.
I need my goodix linux drivers NOW!!! My inspiron 5402 has a useless fingerprint sensor under linux and I haven't found drivers for it!
My son gonna love this LEGO!!!
This laptop is amazing love the modularity but I really wish the motherboard + cpu could be swapped / upgradable and same for gpu. So in future if user wanted a better board cpu or a better gpu could just swap it
Microsoft is now the company hindering us using old computers that are still perfectly operational at least with windows.
I'd watch an entire LTT video filmed on that webcam
Watch how there are no new modules to buy in two years
It's not that Apple cannot design&build an upgradable infrastructure, they just decide not to. Simply put, profit/greed trumps integrity. With this brand, I feel like they've picked up where IBM left off before being sold to Lenovo.
its cool but can it run windows 11
If I had the money I'd buy this IMMEDIATELY. This should be the standard for laptops, period.
everyone outside of north america watching this hoping it's successful enough to be released elsewhere
We need more little options especially for mobile things like laptops, phones and tablets. Like my Asus laptop has a option if you let it plugged in it only charges to 80% and holds it on 80%. There are way to many brands that doesn't have little options like this installed.
I love this will be buying it
Nice
Aw, they're not accepting UK orders yet.  So sad.
17:40 you really had to rub it on us weebs
They had me at colour coded screws. I'm sold.
Surely that's the best webcam of any laptop on sale today?
I will buy one the moment it becomes available in europe!
Great but where's the trackpoint?
This really start to fight back into proprietary standards into mobiles devices if this become successful it's probably to hurt other company that focus into e waste. And maybe on the future framework's work can cause into standardization of mobile  computers.
It is still running Windows = throw it into trash
interesting
Ahhh no shipping to Straya yet!!! </3
wow!
Can't wait to make my own modular ports for it.
this is a pentesters dream
Very welcome approach.But thinking of all upgradable phone projects I have seen over the years -- not convinced one can find any replacement module in 3 years...
actually looks worth buying, just gotta wait till its in NZ is the issue
ngl, i haven't seen Linus this hyped since a very long time
Glad you mentioned the BIOS but I'd like to see CoreBoot (open source BIOS) on this. Then I'd be really psyched.
Can't you just buy a magnetic charger adapter for usb c?
I would buy it if they let me swap the motherboard with a new one in future (with more powerful CPU ofc
i can;t access micro center :v
This is the coolest laptop I've seen in a long time.  How would I get this as a European? I could not see a nordic keyboard layout or European ac adapter. Also buying the extension modules over seas with toll and stuff could be a deal breaker in the long run.  I would love to support this product though.  PS: Also the I could not find any way to customize the bezel and the keyboard as in the video. Is it something I misunderstanding?
That transparant keyboard really gives me 2000 vibes.
i dont care about how the device look i care about performance
Put steam library from PC to laptop in just one simple step
Apple hhhmmm this seems to be popular Linus has crashed their website. We can charge 1000 dollars plus for each upgrade!  Get to work Chinese slaveworkerhelperrainbowcannonpartners!
A replacable battery? They are lieing! Every device dies as soon as the battery dies. And every battery and device lives exactly 2 years and 1 day. Thats a physical law. This video is fake. #FuckThePlanet
F for broken back glass of Linus samsung
Last time I looked at this, it was "coming soon". It's really cool to see it come to reality. This might just have to be my next laptop. I really hope 4k and touch display options are available by then.
I'd love to have a laptop like this! It's been an ache not be able to freely upgrade my laptop for so long.
More advanced laptops auto disconnect battery/ stop charging it if left plugged in.   Note: Dell XPS does not because dell makes only shoddy products.
lmao anyone remember Google's project Ara?
the freaking *Domo Arigato* as Quality Control after Linus says something about Anime stuff XD
Great technology with a promising future, but it's not here yet. I went to try out their framework configuration, and it's only at the $750 price tag if you supply your own memory, storage, wifi card, and operating system, and also get a lower spec CPU.  So you can get a much more capable machine, for cheaper, unless you already have a bunch of spare computer parts, and even then, it's not cost effective.  I assume most of this cost is in the research and development of the modular technology, but still, the price to performance ratio is pretty terrible unless you already have spare components.
this laptop makes my desktop cry T.T
Amazing.
Holy crap, never wanted to buy a laptop on principle before.
I love this laptop
SCREWS!! NO GLUEEE!!!!
Without PGA CPU why even bother
Incredible. This looks as easy and fun to mess around with as it is with older thinkpads, but with more recent and powerful hardware! This is the kind of responsible consumerism we need for the future.
next gen amd cpu && usb4 = thunderbolt 4  will be nice ~
The virgin flagship laptop vs the chad framework laptop
I'd totally buy one if it was less than 600-500€
If I ever need a laptop again, this is it. I hope they will be still around by then.
Schematics or die: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMZp8ErTTuk  PS: don't get me wrong, it's great compared to the glued in shit, but "repairable" it's not.
I want to build PC , please give me capital
"Laptop CPUs are simply not available with pads on the bottom" My Lenovo L430: *Laughs*
"Power on on AC attach" is an option meant to be used in case you use your laptop as a server for something.
Alex saying 'cry me a river lmao'
I wanttttttt pc please
Battery disconnect also minimises risk of dropping a screw shorting something when opening it up. Run the disconnect and then disconnect from wall power. A lot of HP laptops have such a function for this reason, but it is a pain in the arse to activate, and impossible anyway when certain things are broken.
We're only a short step from having small cpu-modules, bios-modules, etc, that will fit into nicely wide edge connector slots in there :) This one is really awesome though, love it!
from someone that has DIY my own gaming pc's since 2006. i would buy this laptop
#LouisRossmann
The reason Apple doesn’t give any type of modular capabilities is because like if someone changes stuff that makes their device slower or worse and then it is used by any other person it will effect apples bran value as it can show that they don’t make the best devices.
I feel like they could have maybe added another port to the USB-C module
What’s the display hertz? Cannot find it on the website.
An actual not shit webcam - bought... (just have to wait till my ipad pro 2018 eventually dies in approximate 7 years to 5 minutes)
I like to see a version with an MXM GPU
wait ... what was the drawback??
Yeah soldered RAM is an abomination.
Please, please *PLEASE,* can Framework start up a modular political party? This "Propriety" Republican bullsh*t where they won't change for the better even if 95% of their own base want something is even worse than Dell or Apple. I wish I was 100% joking....
Touch option and a 360 display in future would sell this thing for me.
My Girlfrind is shopping tech by colour... Big Tech Companys having people like her in Mind when designing new Stuff.
Apple and other OEMs: *(Points Lightsaber) He’s too dangerous to be left alive!*
You know its realy good when linus pre order asap👍
I want one.
Fairphone next ? https://shop.fairphone.com
I want a screen backplate with the big linus face meme on it
A gaming Framework would be sweeeeeet!
That's the same thing we say about software. This is Linux of the hardware world
This laptop is gorgeous 😍
I really hope there is a 16 inch option
3. time watching this video.. ;-)
I think you guys broke framework's website :D trying to look around but seeing a lot of errors! It's a good sign, I'm super super tempted
we need more milking this laptop, this has absolutely need to be compared with ALL manufacturers , so nice!
This is awersome!!!!  It means you can make a dock for it that HOLDS the laptop at all 4 of its moduleholes. Popp in 2 dc motors design a y shaped 2 type c arm onto 2 sides and because it has supporting grooves iit will stay on a wall asa 2nd screen or whatever. And you could attach a tinymicrocontroller on the go that FITS into that mezal thing so u only see gpio pins for fast circulit testing. Or even better an hdmi in for capturing console content without some shitass usb c to a dongle then capture card
I feel Linus is always on cocaine in all of his videos :D
Such a great product, shame they arent open to pre-orders in Australia just yet.
Now that's the laptop I have been waiting for 😌
1:38 Ultra Rare Linus Saves
When this comes to Sweden I'll order one
Will buy as soon as UK keyboard layout arrives
I love this so much. The only downside AFAICT is no 3060 equivalent GPU option and a high refresh rate screen
This is actually amazing! 👏
I hope I can buy that in the future in Europs (Austria/Germany). That sounds really good!!!
Power on AC. Is good if you're using the laptop for a server, data collection, or any application where you want 24/7 run time but there is possibility of running out of power. The battery acting as built in UPS. This might not be a common first use for the laptop but will create more possibilities for the laptop living a second  life as a media server or some other use. Another exciting possibility is 3rd party replacement mother boards. In the future they could release a board that handles the basic power management and provides a few voltages, and some input/output interfaces. Then people could design third party boards for things like Raspberry Pis, Amiga, C64, Acorn, etc. Yes, those devices might only sell a couple hundred units each but it's not like Framework has to do a large investment in development and support to make this a reality.  Another use could be as a base platform for diagnostic equipment, user interfaces, etc that will need long field lives.
I'm the CIO of my company. The instant they start making 15.6” Ryzen-based machines, we're in. I'd prefer a high-end model with GPU and mechanical keys. OLED screen option. TB4. We may wind up making modules and other things for this. Los of possibilities!
If the laptop turns on after all that wabbling, hitting and twisting, it's a must-buy for me
Even if these guys succeed to deliver Apple and Dell will come out and kick the crap out of the competition if their marketing team thinks it is profitable
Darrowshire launch 30 july. vanilla wow server with old pre nerf AV
Can I run an external GPU using those thunderbolt interfaces?  I'd definitely get one when touchpad is an option.
I waited soo long for this laptop, and I'm so glad to see initial impressions seems even better than I expected :)
I'm going to need a WWAN bay. I also feel that the USB-A port adapters should have had two A ports off a little switch.  1.1mm key travel is definitely not enough, I'm used to 1.6 - 1.8   Great concept though and I hope they will keep going.
How to attach a gpu to it
Full size SD card reader should be the next item in the shop ... Micro SD ... Why? If you drop them you can't find them. They blow away by the wind. They are hard to handle with big hands, even normal sized hands.
This company really need support from the tech enthusiast community to operate and survive from giant and business swallowing  companies.
11:56 what daaaa fuhg
Needs some tweaking, but I'm in! Tweaks like making the modules standard and sell/deliver it like PCB-s, then you can pop them into whatever shaped plastic blocks to fit into the whatever shaped laptop case. So dont make the blocks proprietary, instead make the modules themselves in a standardized way (PCB) This way it can be used in many different cases, maybe it will spread across some other laptop manufacturers, who knows. That would be cool!
Once a Nordic keyboard option is available, I will 110% buy one for my wife and I.
Glare display in 2021? no need for an upgrade path, its a no-no
If it was in the UK would be ordering one right now will have to wait I guess.
I really wish this  had GPU upgradability
3 minutes in and im sold! im hoping the ship to Australia!
Yooo, this has me very optimistic about their future
Will they do AMD?
Cries in german keyboard layout..
15:25 it has to reach that guy
i hope they have success
Linus I tried to buy a laptop with upgradeble RAM and failed. In most of the laptops there is only one ram slot where the ram is shouldered. And one port for nvme so you have to discard your old ssd if you want to upgrade.
This is what you call a company that actually cares. I recently bought myself a laptop from Lenovo for school. Thank God it was from Amazon because I'm refunding that and getting this
"Not a ton of dynamic range" I don't know what the fuck that is but that camera goes way and beyond almost every laptop camera I've ever seen.
Linus Drop Tips nearly strikes again
Well, I'm sold. I'm buying my whole family one of these!
When you need to present something using your laptop you need to make sure to have the right cable or some kind of dongle. Well no more! Just have different expansion cards in your bag and your good to go.
GREAT idea, hope Framework can survive.
Normal people: "complaints about gf to best friend" Him: *"Complaints in YouTube video"* What a legend
Shame that intel and amd don't sell socketed laptop CPUs anymore. I recently upgraded my laptop (from 2010) to an i7 from a pentium, and seeing the old laptop breeze through chrome was a very satisfying experience
Apple: We can't do right to repair - fixing your own stuff is dangerous!  Framework: That thing your looking at? It just told your phone where to find instructions to fix it. Also, would you like some stls so you can print your own custom case?
Would this have the special security for windows 11?
you can the motherboard outside of the case....this opens up a shit ton of possibilities, hell i have an project right now I could use a motherbord like that for... so all i need is one of their motherboards. hope they will sell those seperate some time in the future.
I don't even need a laptop but I want to buy this just to support this company. It is amazing and its the exact opposite of the industry standard these days. They are trying to squeeze every single penny out of you. And look at how customer friendly Framework is. I genuinely hope they'll succeed. We need companies like them.
0:35 "it did not come in one piece"  *Flashbacks to the time OnePlus sent over their phone to Jerry rig everything at that exact same state*
Perhaps there is hope in humanity yet.
I really hope this kick-off a wave of modular laptops. I like the part where once it becomes slightly slower for your usage yo ucan take the mobo out and build a custom case for it. You can then donate it to a school or ppl who need a pc for studies/work. I really hope ppl give them a chance. Can you imagine the amount of e-waste that can be reduced.
This looks really promising
They got a strong framework
Open Source Laptop
I would buy one if it had the top end performance, for my line of work I need the hardware that can handle the loads put on it
I want to buy one. Is it available in India?
Yeah, this will probably sell out relatively quickly.
Great way to keep all my stickers going for years 👀
Shut up and take my money.
Framework with arm64 - that would be more interesting than Intel…
THIS is the laptop we've been wanting.
How is the cabled earbuds debate still a thing? It’s like using DVD instead of streaming…
If they make a 17"+ with a GPU count me in.
I do hope this will become a trend. Maybe a DIY laptop is the next DIY market.
Was literally telling someone the other day that I wouldn't be buying a laptop again any time soon. But after seeing this, will buy one as soon as they're available in Australia!
seems pretty good :v i would love to buy it in the future :v
18:19
So just the CPU? I guess this won't be any good for even casual gaming. I'm not talking 4k120fps Cyberpunk, but like, 1440p Final Fantasy 14 or something. You know, the 10 year old MMO.
if this laptop costs 800 dollar without any module slots, that will be a great deal. And each cable module cost around 30 dollars , that will a fire deal 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yeeeahhh..... well I love the sentiment but I've seen this whole sales pitch before.. we'll get 2 or 3 new modules on the market over the next 18 months, at limited quantity.. Then they announce that the project is "regrettably" no longer in active development.. "Thanks for your support" etc..   Unless they actually guarantee in writing that they are going to continue to sell new upgraded motherboards for like.. the next 8 years.. ?? Then I would just rather buy a new laptop every 4 years..
I'm not in the market for laptops, but this certainly would be my first pick!
I find this project very exciting! I would like to see a more performance oriented review with dollar to dollar comparison to a different manufacturer laptop. Also it would be nice to address the lack of a gpu and whether it could be added. Otherwise, great video!
17:46 Thank you for putting your dollars into supporting these kinds of projects. It matters.
This is innovation at its finest.
HP and DELL don't glue much, even most screens are stuck on with tesa strips, easily to replace
Simply love the idea behind it - gonna get one as soon as I can. Hopefully this startup will be successful.
Do those usb-c modules support TB4 tho? That would be a dealbreaker for me!
would actually get it if i didnt already have a functioning laptop
wow this is fantastic, why wasn't this here yet. love the product, if I need a new personal latop then I am looking for them and hope they still exist.  altough, make a tablet as well
8:19 *Linus Tech Drop*
❤️
Is there a way to modify it so it becomes a 2in1? Maybe that could be a great follow-up video :)
I'll buy this
Damn that's cool!
hi how you doing i hope u are great keep it up
This is how laptops should be.
Oh God I really hope this company gets the funding it needs to mass produce this. Best implementation of an idea in a long time
I went to the site and big disappointment. Only English US keyboard... good joke of a "customizable" product.
its a cool idea but no dedicated gpu makes it a no go for me
Yess
Nooo - US/Canada only... at the moment I hope
Oh God I really hope this company gets the funding it needs to mass produce this. Best implementation of an idea in a long time
Should I upgrade my Rtx 2060 super to a 3070?
Excited for an ARM version of it!
used a non upgradable laptop for a decade with no issues, issues either happen in the first 2 3 months or never. If you pay 3 to 4k upfront for the cpu and ram the laptop will last you at least a decade to 12 years if you dont get unlucky, which is decent. Most issues will come from the motherboard and the cpu is inevitably soldered to it. That is why you dont see such offers. Removable batteries add significant weight. All laptop batteries can be replaced with some exceptions.
Can't wait till companies dell and hp gets demolished by companies like this.
I hope someday they would have upgradeable cpu and gpu
wow that thing is expensive!
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
AMAZING, please let us all stand together and buy into this marvelous idea. This company really needs support to pressure Microsoft and Apple into designing for the users, and not the wallet..
How expensive is it?
Laptops are build to fully replace it due to a business model just like some car brands break down more. Not because they have to, but to sell parts. For a long time cars also had crap quality for this reason. Fairly cheap to buy new, but you also need money for parts during the life span. Most 80's cars were horrible for this reason.
Do we get this in europe?
I WANT ONE. THIS IS GOOD INNOVATION.
would love to see the chonker version of this design or idk, maybe by the time i'm upgrading my laptop in idk, 5 more years? (got mine in 2019, acer nitro5) chonker laptop is a thing of the past and you won't ever need a chonker laptop for any particular reason
A laptop is not completely upgradable unless it has a feature to upgrade it's GPU to a flagship level GPU.
*Apple has left the chat*
phone over the years:lets just crank all the thing in one board laptop over the year:we need more ugrade ability so make it removable otg
*But...* Does it game?
I... need this. I am in love with this. This is everything I have ever wanted.
Anyone knows when they will start shipping to Europe?
Welp. Guess I'm buying one!
omfg, I want a 15 inch x1 extreme replacement from them! My gen 2 will go for a while yet, but I would love to eventually replace it with something like this.
Why hasn't Louis Rossman commented yet? 🤔
7:30 so true
oooooo, maybe i'll get one eventually once i start hating my ipad i won in a contest. (otherwise i'd never have an apple product)
there hasnt been a single time that i havent laughed wen he goes to tel us abt the sponser
* Cries in McBook Pro *
Linus with a cap backwards 😍😍😍
Still figuring out if they spelt “upgradeable” wrong or right
I will buy it, that's it.
Framework make a upgradable laptop  Also The company who soldered ram to lenovo laptops
That's mildly revolutionary
I can tell any time the word "performant" is used the script is probably written by Anthony, Jake, or Alex lol
me watching on my m1 MacBook : 👁👄👁
Linus's face,voice sounds like tyler from dude perfect right?
Hello
Once they get big-little or good arm CPU options I'm in, I been looking for a new laptop for awhile and this looks like the one but I'm not upgrading till I can get something with at least a full day battery life
They're not as upgradeable, but I have a lenovo laptop, and you can find every part in it on their website, including compatible alternate parts.  And in my opinion, my laptop looks better. my only grip with my current laptop is the build quality is utter garbage. the hinge pulled out of the display a couple of weeks after my warranty expired.
louis rossmann approved .. I guess!
dbrand :))))
I really don't see the point of a customizable laptop. it looks awful, its not even that customizable, and once you customize it youre never going to change it so what's the point when you could of bought a better laptop with the features you are just going to set and leave anyways, it just means a bunch or shit I have to put together or lose when I could of just pulled a laptop out of the box and used it. if I want to run video games at 8k ill use my pc, but for simple work, using word documents, spread sheets, and google there's no point in upgrading every time a new piece of hardware when it comes out on a laptop unless maybe just maybe youre a game dev or editor who needs to be on the move but even then I doubt this laptop would do that for you and youre not going to find a better video editing laptop over a MacBook pro like it or not. so ill stick to my MacBook. cool concept tho I guess?
Did y'all DDOS their site trying to buy one. I can't get onto it lol
LTT broke the site.... frame.work not available currently XD
Please let this succeed. I would kill to have an upgrade able laptop, but this current one just won’t fulfill my needs due to performance limitations. Dedicated gpu options would be killer
do they do world wide sales and service ?
They will not survive, competition will guarantee it.
Note: when you hold laptops from corners, it will easily break
I wonder if @rossmangroup has seen this? Looks like something he'd be interested in.
An upgradeable laptop would not make sense for me. I always kill it with coffee or something :/
11:52 lol, what is my paralysis demon doing here.
this is man kinds greatest creation
I really like the concept but without the advertising revenue of the big players in the market I think they will struggle to get the sales needed to keep the company going.  Its a shame if I am right, this is how laptops should be.
1.1m views in 15 hours. No wonder the framework website is down
I'd buy one
"No longer hold any water"..? They didn't hold water to begin with!
Framework + Fairphone is the killer repairable mobile device combo.
C´mon crapple fanbois, tell me its impossible to do something like this and apple is consumer friendly... haha
if this is a dream, don’t wake me up!
im willing to pay 3000
If I will need a new laptop in the future I will check out framework defnitly, hopefully they will have options for outside the US as well
I hope they also sell parts or CAD files to print them for when their chassis will go EOL. This has huge potential. I'm waiting for either a Ryzen/Vega ( or Xe if Xe is powerful enough) or ARM/Risc5 for mobility. but the idea is sure really nice.
15:09  How u doing.... 😅
I went to check their website and this isn't even unreasonably priced. Very impressed with this. I hope they do well.
YYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAA
What about graphic cards? I want a swapable gfx 😂😂
Wish I could buy a high end graphics card...
This is what I wanted for so many years, the way they just give you the cad designs to make a new case if you want is for me the best, you could just throw away everything swap up two ethernet ports and you got a new router when the processor is not up to the daily tasks anymore. I've been doing that with my old laptops and is a pain to buy a ton of adapters just to do that. What I mean is that you can repropose it the way you like it, think about Rpi on steroids. I'm crying right now.
I'm impressed. Please succeed.
Gonna buy one as soon as it's availble in europe. This is fucking awesome
7:35 amen Lunus! A-fcking-MEN!
If an AMD processor was available on them, I would 100% get one too.
The one thing that concern me is the battery is on the rest pad of the laptop. Would it heat ur wrists to an unbearable degree?
one of the most pro-consumer things I've seen in years, such a breath of fresh air
This is the first tech company that I just want to support so bad not because they're cool but because of their balls to go against the norm when it comes to laptop builds. I would love to invest in their company once I recover from this goddarn pandemic.
This is the polar opposite of a macbook. No wonder most of their employees are ex-apple engineers.  But sadly enough, these kind of products aren't the best for business.
Install component for this laptop: sudo apt install USB-port
imagen in the futere where new parts are invented for laptopts beter displays, faster memmory and those things and you don't need to buy an new laptop but just the parts. How ceazy is that. Realy love this laptop.
Aw please exist in near future, don't go extinct!
This is amazing, I think I’m drooling over this Laptop as much as Linus …🤤
Imagine the possibility
Imagine, putting a graphic card module upgrade into the side of your computer.
Hey Framework! Im from Germany and i would love to help you to distribute here! Hit me up (I know you read comments here ;) )
This is awesome! Hope to see more in the future
Oh man you got me excited. Imagine doing a presentation and you don't have the compatible port but then you just change the freaking port 🥰
Linus is squealing of joy but it's kinda sorta reinventing the wheel, it's like an IBM ThinkPad from early to mid 2000s with everything user replaceable and a screw length reference printed on the bottom.  Swapping ports is a nice touch but it's a feature that can hardly be described as upgrade, it's just a reconfiguration of what you already got. And I reckon it will do the job as long as you settle with one setup from day one, if you need several configurations then a bulkier yet single USB-C multiport dongle would be much handier than shuffling connector tiles like on Domino Day.  I do like that something like that appeared on the market, I hope they succeed in their market niche.
OMFG! This is the laptop I always wanted, even though I didn't know it! The screen seems awesome. Keyboard could be replaceable for better typing experience. Maybe in the future even mainboard replacing? I always had the opinion good laptops should include one USB-C on each side for charging on whichever side you need. Now I might not even have to sacrifice a port, sweet!
This is like a box of chocolate for tech people  I FUCKING LOVE IT
I feel like it's more about making a bigger profit from the end-user than "not trusting the user" when it comes to today's laptop manufacturers. If parts were always replaceable, a user would just have to buy that one part instead of a whole new laptop which would cost the user more, but pay the company more.
my 12 inch early 2015 macbook with one usb c port starts sweating... 😰
i need one:)
I wish I had known about this company be for I just brought my Lenovo :(.
Omg my next laptop is this brand stay this way frame work and you will be the big boys in no time
Linus having a laptop wet dream for 18 minutes and 46 seconds
I'm in for this, I hope this doesn't end up like that modular phone project from a few years ago
I literally just bought a laptop for school. I would've loved to see this video before hand! Well worth the invest!
I never understadn people that wanna touch their laptop screen when you have a much better input option already built into the machine.   you just making your laptop screen smudgy.
Well, it's totally not affordable where I'm from. Holy crap...
Finally!!!
10:58 - While technically true, a lot of people dread opening up their laptops to do this because of all the short cables they have to put back.
This idea is great! I just hope it doesn't end up like the Saturn car company.
I can imagine framework ecosystem, with many third-party manufactures providing variety of extensions.
They're talking in Fahrenheit right?
Damn, that laptop is so cOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL. I wish I could buy one...
this is very very useless and stupid like you guy blame macbook have usb-c just 2 lmao
Lets back company like this!
i am so hoping for a succes for this, if they cant make the cpu or gpu swapable in this thing, make it at least so oyu can swap it togheter wit the motherboard, so upgrading to a new gen dosnt cost oyu a whole notebook but just the motherboard, cpu and gpu chich are usualy the only reason why someone upgrades their device anyway, pls pls pls dear lords and gods out there make this a success
If only other companies can learn from them
Super cool, i would like one. Only a shame that they don't deliver in my region. Only thing I would like to see is a module with 2 usb connections in 1. Otherwise if I want 3 usb's I only have 1 slot left for video.
Now we just need to hope they succeed so the point will forever be proven. But we'll have to wait and see...
Sad that you cannot choose your own display chips for this Laptop
Linus can you do a video on how much can a  HP EliteBook 2560p Laptop can be upgraded to ....
7:31
Push it! Push it! Push it! Something like this has to become the new standard. So many people, hundreds of thousands or even more have been waiting for such a device for years, this just has to succeed.
I thought he said jizz kill 🤣🤣
Ok, that's more usable, I normally stay away from anything with battery life, not about to jump on the boat but maybe a future iteration if it manages to stick around.
This is what i want to see more of rather than something like a steam deck which is going to be obsolete in terms of graphics and processors in a few years
How are the thermals?
I love everything about this. Do they ship to Europe?
Framework server's crash lmao
Just take my money already
Now, install RGB light for that laptop
Beautiful idea
Imagine having 2 of these, one low spec and high spec. I, as a programmer, could order the new parts and put the spare parts in the low spec one for my wife. Just brilliant.
LOVE this idea, but should they make a gaming version?🤔
If this is in Australia I know who I'm getting my next laptop from
I want to buy one but I dont need a laptop.
Awesome! Now we just need phones like this.
If it went with AMD processor - I would take him.
“game changer” babe, it’s game changer
When linus tossed his hand with the laptop I jumped out of my bed and thought its gone...
I don't really dabble with laptops, but this is seriously exciting. Hope this pans out so we get more user friendly devices elsewhere.
Im uncomfortable the way he hold the laptop ...
aaaaand its out of stock
so, outside of the i/o ports the system is no more upgradeable than many other laptops. while the ability to  replace parts is nice replacement does not equal upgrade. so, whats the big deal?
It is great
This a dream machine for a linux user. Love it, hope they succeed !
The camera was respectable? Linus, it's the best camera on laptop you reviewed on your channel!
So what’s the difference between this and all the other modular laptops that came before and failed? I’d love for it to succeed but I don’t think enough people actually care.
This will be really eco friendly but if you throw it out, other people can make their preferred layout and use it happily
freaking COOL laptop , literally the only one that I'd pull the trigger for if I was not happy enough with my desktop /phone combo but I'm sorry to say I just can't buy their point on "how are we going to make this profitable". Maybe I didn't understand it, but relying on people wanting more from them so they keep selling stuff is really.... not how it works? How many customers are going to be constantly buying stuff from them? How much stuff is there to buy actually , their package already seems to have it all? If I want a new SSD or more RAM , am I not getting that from Amazon anyways? Even the MOBO can be reused 10 years from now, which is AWESOME , but they see no money from that either , since I'd have the full How To today.  They made it sound as "Laptop as a Service" , but with everything already in it. With that said, proof me wrong guys!! :D I'd love to see laptops be like this in the future.
As a person who has a hard time picking laptops due to upgradability and modifiability, I can really get on board with what Framework are doing here. The next laptop I buy may well be from Framework. As a person who has taken apart laptops a lot I never bought into the whole locked down ecosystem of components argument so it's great a company has finally cut the BS. Well done Framework you have got my attention!
Repairable Laptop.... SOLD!!!
I came into this like, this looks cool, I wonder if I can invest.  Linus: I might wanna invest.  👀👀👀
Great work frame.work!
Hardware version of Linux
i have no use for this. il buy one just so companies start copying their design.
thick -> coarse; thin -> fine.  Which damned captioner wrote "segway"?  you guys -> ye; lengths -> spans; them -> whom; PC -> DT; there..here: pick one; Framework, singular or plural: pick one; should -> ouht; little bit: your brain; travel -> fare -> stroke; 0 != O; won't -> shan't; Framework and viewers aren't guys you wicked gaf.
This is actually perfect. Only thing I'd want is for the logo to light up.
so i want to buy this
Omg I really want one but I'm in the UK 😭😭😭
"The power button / Fingerprint sensor was built by Goodix and features *_Linux_* drivers." That's a lot of respect.
can you take a dongle and connect it all?
I've just realised that linus's phone has cracked back glass. It's been given the linus treatment
Fairphone 3 also has perfect modularity in a phone
Fantastic appliance. 😯👍🏼
But how many poeple will actually use these features?
Almost perfect, but, if this is so configurable so why they don't have a Ryzen? To be honest Intel XE still not best choice comparable to VEGA 8. So, it would be nice to have Ryzen motherboard.
This is enough to make a grown man cry and that is okay.
Wow, think this will be my new laptop, once they become available in the UK
i think they should adopt the earning models of free to play games. they can make money by offering different visual customizations, and a rspectable margin of profit on hardware updates. And if they could have a component exchange program for upgrading, this would be dream.
Reminds me of Google Project Ara
man, i havent seen linus this excited for a long time :D and with good reason!
I want one of these but a bigger model, a gaming laptop model that allows me to change motherboards, cpu, gpu and thermal system. Oh, and at least make 1 thunderbolt 3 interchangeable port. Please make it!!! Let me build my very own gaming laptop and make changes at any given time I want 🙏🙏🙏
Wow! This is the ultimate Linux Laptop
That tracking effect is horrible, stop it editors
I think there should be thunderbolt attachments that give you 2 ports instead of 1 on an entire block
Wholesome laptop!
Amazing! I wish them all the success possible with this product. Looking foreward to buying this as my next laptop
Why am i not surprised at all that Linux's phone looks like it was dropped?
I wish they do a gaming fully modular laptop like imagine u buy a 500 or 600 laptop and then upgrade the gpu and upgrade cpu in the future and make that 500 or 600 laptop be the best gaming laptop for ur need and u get what you want and throw what u don't want i know there's pc but pc can't be movable like laptops 🙂
Such a frickin awesome laptop
u know u made an awesome laptop when freakin linus pre-orders it instantly
3:10 Nice air-circulation for laptop
Damn, I'm gonna order one 🔥
Well, if this thing takes off, either the same company or a competitor will build an AMD platform.
Weirdly, the battery switch off is the part I found the most “I need this”
after years of apple, coz win laptop just too much headache. finally there is a nobrainer win laptop i can go.
So they gonna be like let the game be cheap and make the skins expensive
I got sold out on that laptop.
Well, for the first time in 6 years I found a laptop to change to, yeah, I have an acer from 6 years ago but I just use it as an easier way to work on basic stuff on the go and I didn't find anything that would be a reason to change (not that I actively searched for it either)
me now feeling sad i got the new m1 macbook instead of this 😞😞😞
awsome !  hope we will be able to order one in Europe sooooon :D
How tech companies combat climate change :  Apple: "We reduced the package size for the iPhone (so that you need to buy a separate package for a charger. At least the carbon footprint is on you lol... thanks, no thanks for being our customer)"  Samsung and others: "Uh me too I guess"   *Framework: THIS*
I want one
Thank you guys for sharing this with us!
"Next next next next" haha lol
Huge props to the Framework team for making something that people actually want. Amazing how a new company can bring out such a unique product in such a competitive space while being something many people want!
It's been something like 5 years since i started tinkering with old thinkpad because of their upgradability and robustness, but right now, i'm really asking to myself if my next laptop still will be and thinkpad ! Like, i've got a T430 right now, which is the far end of upgradable cpu on laptop, and it's kina old right now. The only thing which slow me down is the lack of trackpoint (yeah in thinkpad user true fashion ^^) !
the like to dislike ratio is insane
Install hackintosh on it
The fact that you can build your own laptop and then install Linux on it (which you can also build from the ground up) is pretty wild
Not yet selling in my region :( Did sign up for news when they do, this is everything i ever wanted form a laptop.
Linus still rocking the Note 9, me too!
I want this sooooooo bad
Was there any word about the GPU in that thing or did I just miss it?
If I needed a new laptop right now that's exactly what I would buy
Can't hit the like button enough!!
Are the publicly traded?
I am confused between asus zephyrus g15 and lenovo legion 5 pro (dolby vision display current in sale in india). which one should i buy please help me...... PLEASE HELP ME I AM CONFUSED!!!
another thing i wish is, they made it secretly Hackintosh compatible, at least make it easy to find kext. that would be the GG laptop for the decade.
It cant be even shipped to Europe.  What a downer. Can't select DIY option to buy, Can't ship it to Europe and can't even see DIY buy options in shop wizard.
too fast cuts, Editors: it's NOT good. Calm down
algorithm
as much as i want this thing to be main stream, this is just one of those great product for tech savy ppl and awful for normal dads product.
I miss laptops from 2000s where you could replace battery in seconds and carry a couple spare ones in your bag. And now you are happy if your battery is not glued and soldered and you can replace it in like 30 minutes after unscrewing and screwing 10+ screws.
I would buy this, will have to wait till it comes to Australia tho
Ok I'm sold, I'm buying one right now!!!
the CPU manfature and PC manufactures conspire   that is why you have BGA cpus    PGA chips was tell 3rd gen i7
Shame I just bought a laptop last year, this seems to tick all my boxes. I'll definitely be keeping my eye on them.
We want upgradable macbook that I can use 7 years
Very awesome I hope they put apple out of business
I swear, I will support framework from now on.
Yes
China is going wild with technological stuff.
Dell and Apple: "That's not how your supposed to play the game"
Why do YouTube thumbnails tend to have someone making an exaggerated goofball expression?
I am happy that they are making this laptop and like the thought behind it. I need a new laptop, and I will be voting with my money.
once me laptop dies i am copping
Now even intros are dark themed, awesome!!
Wait, you mean to tell me Microsoft and Apple have patents for putting a magnet in a hole that your charger goes into? You can fuck right off microapple.
Can it run Crysis?
It's exactly what i've wanted in a laptop. Really excited and hopeful for a future where this is the industry standard (or at least a future where this is a viable option from multiple manufacturers)
At 2:18 Linus being a kid who's getting his toy for first time
The laptop I didn't know I wanted .. until now  EDIT: 60 Watt hour aint 45 ... thats 25% more Intel wasnt able to increse IPC in their 14 nm +infinitiy pluses by that amount
@Linus if you want the Magnetic charging on this: Grab a magnetic usb-c Cable from Amazon, 3d print a custom Adaper socket, hack up an old usb-c extension to connect on the inside and assemble. (might also make for a fun little video)  (yes, you could just plug in the magnetic usb-c part normally, but this way it sits flush with the side of the laptop)
It should have open firmware to be able to compete with System 76.
If I had cash to spare this is one of those things I just buy to help them succeed.
17:15 Activate Windows?!
Great product
looks to good to be true but i really hope it is
Apples business model is basically the opposite of that.
This is like lego
I hope this penetrates the asian market cuz damn i would love to have one
Wooow the qr codes are really smart
Does it work with linux ? anyone tried Ubuntu ?
The dream laptop
ffs I cant buy it because when i click on configure or shop it is 500 error or 404 error. They are not ready for this ad to go on linus chan. Guys from Framework, can you not shit on your own website ?
Modern laptop manufacturers : NOOO you can't just have revolutionary ideas that will make our buisness uselsess!!!  Frameworks : Releases modular laptops without giving a shit
There is literally no justification for not having a repairable device. I found my old broken LG G3. It is super thin, super light, 3000mah battery.... and hear this people.... Removable back cover, interchangeable battery. Whatever manufacturers say, repairability IS an option, if the manufactures wants it... but they don't, they want your device to break so you can buy a new one. We NEED to get around this. I hope EU will enforce laws that devices that aren't upgradeable and repairable can't be sold in the region. It would suck for a while, but eventually manufacturers need to change.
How good is the Os install, bloatware wise? I imagine they aren't overloading it with nonsense and pointless software.
I'M SOLD
Even if just replaceable batteries make a comeback in laptops i would be happy   Memory and storage too
It reminds me a lot about good old Thinkpads, in IBM and very early Lenovo days.
something i  would ACTUALLY buy as recommended by Linus
I will wait and see, still trying to get my money back from EVE laptop and I fear the same again. I would love it to be so. Even better if they had a 2-1 option. Perhaps Linus you can do a story about the EVE experience.
One of the coolest laptops I've seen in years. I enjoy seeing Linus fanboy over this
Holy shit this is awesome!! Omfg I want this
pay your windows
Can you use linux on this laptop?
gamers:           *time to make it ultra gamimg laptop*
$300 to build it implies engineers who just don't want to. Don't want to build it. Don't want to repair it. Would rather you handled that bit. What a great philosophy!
old thinkpad tank : our bettle wilbe legendary
This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think it looks like a 200 dollar Chromebook. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but I guess I just like the Apple design language more.
They still have the gold pc!
I'll be back at Christmas time
“The dells not even fucking thinner”-Linus
This is the future we should have had 20 years ago.
Not sure they were realize what they've just unleashed.
Hmmm, bottom vents. No thank you. This should not exist in a "lap-top"
Wooooah!  Super cool!  May consider one in the future.
Still quite expensive given that the model with an i5, no storage, no RAM, and no wifi, no OS is at $750.
Support this!!!
WOWWWWW..... I CAN SEE THIS BEING THE NEW NORM....
they just cornered the market - I will never buy any other laptop :)
Not available in my region yet. Well, please let this thing succeed so they can expand their business in other countries.
This is fucking awesome!
oh my god I WANT IT.
Linus again pirates windows...17:17.  .... XD
Thats the wet dream of a linux user.
Automate Comment to Specific Accounts for Instagram and other features. This app only costs $3.
Ok, this time I'm TOTALLY sold: this is the laptop of my dreams that has finally come true. I'm going to order it, despite I live across the pond and, ideally, I would have liked a different keyboard layout option (at least a UK one with its fat ENTER button)
I love the idea, but they currently lack of AMD Options and are very pricy. And there lies the biggest problem of all modular devices: They are usually a lot more expensive. What makes sense, but you can get a slim and equally fast notebook from a non modular manufacturer twice for the same price as the framework notebook. If they manage to drop the price about 30% they would be a real alternative. But currently, this is just an expensive toy for enthusiasts (There is nothing wrong with this, but I would love to see products like this in broad usage)
ربما
It’d be cool if they had swappable cpus using that weird Chinese cpu mod Linus looked at years ago.
once my surfacebook dies this will be my replacement. The stylus support was my key point when buying it, but after my university studies are done i dont think i'll use it that often .. and this laptop is just purely amazing
I just look at it and I know I want it. So elegant and thoughtful!
that's my next windows laptop once my current one is old enough
This is amazing, i want it
I wonder if it has a i3 version for in-budget consumers
That modular IO is actually awesome! I need to have an HDMI port on my laptop because I often connect it to a TV to watch a movie, or need to connect it my monitor. But when I'm not... just swap it out and get an extra USB port! That would simply amazing!  I also really like how Linus mentioned the fingerprint scanner is supported in Linux... my platform of choice!
This product will be hit in asia because we prefer upgrade more then buying a new product. This can be the future of laptops
That battery disconnect feature is not what you said it was, its for when you want to take it apart to access something on the motherboard. What you said is doable with software if the motherboard supports it.
The Main problem is, that in two years that you want to upgrade, there will be no ADDONS, UPGRADES or COMPANY to buy it from.
Is that IKEA laptop? :)
This is gonna be HUGE
I hope this doesnt die
Can i stick an egpu in dat laptop?
sir please help me
This is fantastic!!
Next LTT modular laptop
your phone back glass is scatered
This is going to be my next notebook
I'm in the market for a new laptop, so please let Frame.Work know that I'll come as soon as I have the money :)
2 AM CST and framework is currently down for maintenance, Linus endorsing their product has apparently made them go viral.
Meanwhile Apple is soldering on the SSD and Ram onto their laptops with zero consideration of repair or even data recovery in the event of system damage. Inexcusable.
Y'know, I was thinking that I want to get a laptop, if this has good (enough) specs in the future there's a good chance I'll actually get this product
Yeah this is actually awesome. This company is about to get a whole lot of business. Linus may not tonally SOUND like this is a big deal, but it's very rare to see him this positive on ANYTHING. This laptop hits a lot of the right notes!
Meanwhile my ideapad 520's screen is dead(because one of the hinge snapped and broke the display one day), the screw plastic area which holds the metal threads have all gone brittle and broken apart... I'm only left with LAP instead of my LAPTOP :(  I couldn't even find replacement parts for it cus they aren't available for purchase, either in the form of not in stock or an atrocious price markup.  I would've definitely chosen this framework laptop if i had the money right now.
This sounds and looks great. Similar things have been tried many times but the failure point is usually the “big corporate lock in” issue of being a captive market and getting absolutely rinsed on the cost of the clip-in external I/O modules. Hopefully they avoid that, it sounds like they have the right attitude to actually make it work.
Oh my GOD this is amazing. I am seriously considering getting this when I can! I don't care about the early adopter tax or whatever. My Dell laptop of 5 years is sitting there with no screen and a broken keyboard because getting them officially replaced would cost me half the cost of the laptop itself!  Although, whenever someone rocks the boat like this, the big boys are gonna strike down hard the moment this gains enough traction. I wish the best of luck to the Framework team, but..... it is up to us the consumers to demand more of this.  This is clearly the future for any remotely tech headed or even not tech headed folks, and it is truly up to our wallets to vote for more of this kind of thing!
What an awesome laptop!
My laptop has upgradable ram
Ok, I have an idea, and I'm not sure if it'll work. But what if you could plug a graphics card and have it sit on whatever side of the laptop you want? Cooling wouldn't be too hard, because it would be external (as long as it doesn't get too hot to touch). Put a metal/plastic mesh above the fan, fully enclose the circuitry, including from the fan, so it's waterproof and durable. Then you could decide every time you went out if you want power or portability, and it would be almost perfect Update: it exists
That is quite a good webcam to be honest
There is a feature on my laptop where it starts up automatically when I open it, is this feature available in the bios as well?
Battery disconnect - That's a really good feature. Every EV has an option to charge up to 70%, 80% or 90% to prolong battery life. Every 10% drop almost doubles long-term battery life  For example 500 discharge cycles when charging to 100%, ~1000 discharge cycles when charging to 90%. This is because li-ion batteries age faster at higher voltages (higher state of charge)  https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries
I need this
I'm done. With my $1k laptop. ridiculous.
Reminded me of project ara
The website of framework is on Maintenance after Linus featured it.
Does he mean modular
Why your phone is busted tho? @LinusTechTips
This is awesome, I hope more businesses do this in the future! 💞🙌🏼
There's tons of magnetic type c cables out there though
I wish I wanted a new laptop
I WANT THIS
Watch this video, go to the framework website, and it's offline for maintenance, I guess even their website is modular.
If my laptop dies, I really want to buy one like this! But should take a lot of years more I hope.
I need one ._.
Asus tried this in the mid 2000's.  It FAILED miserably because 1)the industry WANTS A CAPTIVE CUSTOMER BASE, and 2)turns out that people buying laptops view them as disposable appliances and as such don't care about being able to upgrade them.  I took one look at the Librem 5 and knew that I had found my next phone.  Four out of five people I show it to aren't impressed and the fifth one gets sticker shock, despite phones from Apple, Samsung, etc being even more expensive.
Product suggestion for Framework : an optional base frame for the unit with double the battery capacity and enhanced cooling, with optional ruggedized wrap. This would be HUGE for field-unit deployments, as battery life and survivability is paramount. I don't believe this would be an expensive proposition, as it would involve basically zero electronics alterations beyond the mainboard firmware detecting the larger battery option. A thicker cooling solution would also give some additional peace of mind for when it has to go out to an oil rig in West Texas in August. Additionally, a slide-over UV and scratch resistant display cover would be extremely welcome and round out the options for ruggedization. Given the very high cost of options in this market, prices such as $249 for the double battery ruggedized/enhanced cooling base, and $129 for the ruggedized UV screen cover would be completely feasible and an outright bargain compared to their contemporaries.   The market for super high battery capacity ruggedized laptops is criminally underserved, and a device from a company as respectable in ethos as Framework is showing to be would be a true breath of fresh air. If they build it, they WILL sell them to capacity.   GJ guys!
Framework literally said "f*ck your proprietary bullsh*t" .This is the future now
Would still like to see upgradable CPU & GPUs for Laptops.
Literally the owner of LTT (and family), Linus has his phone broken?? (or I am seeing things)
So you want to build a PC, don't have a budget, love laptops, hate modernism, and love a headphone jack?? Buy this laptop :)
the most shocking part for me was the webcam 1080p 60fps in a laptop camera. thats way more than just respectable.
Honestly I would have preferred if the headphone jack was modular because those tend to fail more easily from wear and tear.  Also what the fuck? Linus complaining it wasn't showing USD by default when HES CANADIAN and surprised (not in an amazed way) that they have a Canadian site so we can potentially not pay an outrages cost due to conversion, customs, etc or even be able to buy at all, LIEnus' Canadian-ness is sus.
Framework website is down. I guess to much love from this community
This laptop looks fantastic! I’ve already signed up for UK notifications. It’s so good I’m tempted to just sacrifice the quicker render times and get this little ultra book instead of a G14 so I can support these guys. Heck, with the money saved I could put it towards a desktop if I need extra power in the future. I really, really want these guys to succeed. And since they do Windows 10 Pro I can see this being dynamite for corporate IT. Creatives get i7, loads of RAM, HDMI and Micro SD, admin get i5 and USB A for accessories like printers and scanners. Everybody gets what they need, and if the focus of the company changes just add in the ports or components needed.
11:32 hahaha (delllll)
That would be awesome if they offered an extra thick bottom plate that had a graphics card built in so like a stand or dock but something that slots into one of the expansion ports and clips onto the bottom.
This sounds great.I really hope they do well
newsflash: people who disliked this video are being paid by apple
Almost made me cry
If they had 2-in-1s I'd buy. I really want the Linux fingerprint support and modularity.
It'd be sweet if they had backwards compatible upgrade paths. Like you just have to buy a new motherboard from them when you want to upgrade one day and all the components are still viable
Those other laptop manufacturers should follow the same path. We had a client that wanted specific hardware on their laptop and we could not find one that had all the features the client wanted. With modular design laptops, this would not be a problem.
tbh i see this going big especially if the creators allow custom bezels and keyboards
Website is down coz too many ppl are on it
Cant wait till gen 2 when the first round of devices have been proven
It's funny Linus said he wished it had touch because the motherboard supported it. Well he can when it'savailable, he can upgrade it himself at a later date. Love this laptop
Good (Frame) Work
I was so scared that Linus drops it, when he was holding it with the lid removed
Ohhhh yeah, that looks nice! Being able to decide on ports and the location of them is a great feature. I'd be very interested once they come up with a 2-n-1 design that has pressure sensitive pen support.
Could I do light gaming on this? I’m talking low settings destiny 2, terraria, Minecraft and maybe gmod
Very expensive.
Linus: "are these captive? *proceeds to find out that they are* Linus: *absolute nerdgasm*
Sadly this is going to fail or remain niche like any other company that has tried this in the past. It's all about brutal capitalism now, companies that actually care and look out for the consumer can't be as profitable anymore.  A very cool concept though, I certainly hope the modular IO is adopted by more manufacturers. There does seem to be an issue of not fully taking advantage of the space available, like they could make the modular pieces a little bigger and manage to fit 2 USB-A or USB-Cs or a sound card that has separate input/output (convenient for headsets that need it) or any combination of ports. This would allow for much better use of space.
I thought IKEA should be the first one.
I want one. I'll buy one as soon as they are available for my region.
Such an amazing laptop and I was hoping Linus would cover the laptop in LTT and he sure did. Great review too! But the only critique I have is that you did not mention that the only available screen size is the 13.5 inch model.
Is the CPU socketed?
"They got a strong framework."  Linus' face because he wasn't the one who came up with it.  Priceless.
OMG... Lets hope these guys DOMINATE the market.  Please!
mind blown Pow .... I want one
This is amazing
The only good feature of touchscreens is that you can disable it!  But if they start selling these laptops in Europe, this will be on the top of my list when I want to buy a new one.
SD card slots in those changing bays!
I just wish there was an option for Ryzen CPU's and maybe a 5mm thicker version for GPU's, more interchangable slots, more PCIe slots, etc.. like 2 versions
Lol setting up and using time stamp
I love seeing all the features possibly coming from the Lenovo engineering background. The battery disconnect feature, drivers that install easily and the 180 degree hinge. I'm not saying that these are exclusive to Lenovo machines but I was going through this thinking "these features are why I love my ThinkPad so much."
I'm sold
Me want!
Even if hackintosh is dying, im  assuming this would make a hell of a x86 hackintosh device. Maybe even the last gold standard hackintosh laptop
Linus, for the fact you still use your Note 9 with that cracl on the back, i love you, man. still daily drive mine, with a crack on the front. It s just too fricking good to let go. Thought of awitching to a Zenfone 7 later maybe.
This is awesome. I'd love to see a gaming version - those laptops especially need modularization.
6:23 But framework also doesn't mention whether it uses x16 or x8 memory lmao.
can you build the slowest pc ever???
Not bad.
I'm thinking of selling my existing laptop for one of these now.
God I love this.  I am looking forward to buying one.
When my xps dies I'm getting me one of those
When the Reviewer gets sold in his own review😁
Time to apply to framework.
Saw it a year ago and has waited since then
11:56 Skip to this immediately
to everyone who wants this to go mainstream and become a success. Go and buy one ASAP !!!
Linus broke the website
I was just thinking Linus had not dropped something in a while and that instant, drop and clatter across the floor :)
Circular economy! Good
It's just dongles like apple but on the inside not hanging out the side
im sold, ordering one as imtyping
They really REALLY put amazing thought into making this thing. Amazing man.... I hope future laptops integrate these features
11:35
I WANT IT
So happy for saw that trully modular laptop!
If they’re as smart as they think they are they’ll sell us waifu bezels for the screen
This is gonna be my first laptop ong
WOW, just wow.
Framework, nice job guys.
What happened to KFC console 🤔😕
This is fantastic.
I was actually thinking about getting this and installing Linux on it but I can't even order from their website. It keeps saying something went wrong. Guess I'll just stick with my Mac, lol.
Can you send me one pls?
Linus being excited is so nice to see lmao
I understand all the hype about this, it is cool. But when you think about it, all they did was make a USB-C hub and let you put your dongles in slots :D Still, love it.
Hope for one thunderbolt tho because they use intel and because it has 4 only and i say only because they are all type c they should bring a single thunderbolt at least
What an awesome looking laptop! If that's any kind of reasonable in price, that's going to be a massive boon for self repair! I'm sold, it's awesome!
Very nice
Thank you LTT for showcasing this product, hopefully this will mark a change in the tech era.
DO they ship worldwide? I finally found a laptop I want to buy.
I am totally down for this if graphics cards come in to play as well
4:10 to 4:17 I got teary eyes for a bit there
The funny thing is that major brad laptops used to have these features. Pcmcia slots, and bays that could be used for a cd, floppy, harddrive or extra battery depending on what you wanted.
Framework, give me an ethernet jack io pack thing, and I'm keen
Phak I want this asap
This is fucking cool
Im excited to 15,16 inch one  Don't even let me start with a 17 one
Amazing. I can hardly believe it's real. After having to repair my laptop and then many of my family's and friends, this would be so amazing. I hope they publish module testing software to auto-detect defective modules
Congo man 1 million views in just 1 day
I love this thing
Linus why is your laptop on activate windows HAHAH
Can you have Anthony install Linux on it?
"what are you guys super jizzed about 3:30"
best video ive seen in a while. Great job LTT
Linus really like to drop things😂😂😂
I'm not even halfway through the video and I'm already sold. GIMME ONE!!! I don't even need one laptop rn, but I would LOVE to have one like this, with me for many years. I already like modular things, and the organization inside had me nuts. No more pain to find the correct screw! And easy way to open manual of the components and compatibility. I'm in love.
This thing answer my every question about nowadays laptop
how many watts is the CPU configured to run at? edit: nevermind its 28w continuous.
Been watching LMG for years, this is the first laptop that actually looks good!
If Linus likes it enough to daily drive it, can we get a long term review of this? I would love to recommend this to friends and family if I have the peace of mind that the laptop is durable.
I'll be sold as soon as they get a 15 inch model with an OK graphics card.  I just like 15 inch laptops too much
in the end this simply become another scam due to commercially this is not going to make any money for both producer and consumers
even coughing dell is a sin.
Is this basically the laptop version of Phonebloks?
”Like any other laptop, the CPU is soldered on the motherboard”....Clevo DTR....say what?
the compromise is in the manufacturing efficiency and the economy of scale, upgradability costs money, less profits, soooo...
I hope they can make a 15" or even 17", that's a lot of modularity potential.
Man i just love this idea , been waiting for this over 10 years
:DDDD YOU CAN SEE THE SWITCHES
neat
Framework, build one with w discrete GPU please. Even better if it's upgradeable independently
Only down side is that the screen looks flimsy
You should've put the full laptop on the thumbnail, I thought it was one of the chunky boi laptop again
found my next laptop
Too bad I already bought a laptop recently, It's exactly what I wanted. I love modular things (even though they never seem to take off). Guess I'll come again in a couple of years when my current laptop will have a broken keyboard cap and I won't be able to find replacemenr part !
I need this and hope the company thrives enough to expand to Asia..
We demand a review so we know keyboard and track pad and display and charts pleeeeeeease
This looks so good that I am actually going to look at it online. Finally, a laptop that might actually match my needs. This could have been done all this time and we know the manufacturers didn't care about the end user when they made their crappy laptops. I prefer wired mice. I do need to upgrade the graphics though and if i can't do that then its almost there but not yet:( Crap...no AMD :....( The display is fine as I don't like touch anyway. They have a great idea and I like the way they are doing it. Yes, I would want to upgrade as I go, and therefore I would want their products.
I thought this thing allows you to change cpu and graphics card…
looks like the diy edition of the base model costs $107 MORE then the prebuilt base model with the same parts.......
Next up, the Framework gaming laptop? I may end up buying one despite the lack of a GPU.
I want a Framework Laptop! It looks super nice! :D LOL! THE ONLY 2 reasons for Apple computers not being upgradeable is "Apple Greed" so they sell more because you will buy a new computer if you only need to upgrade! ANd reason no.2. Stupid Apple fans that buy it anyway so Apple keeps doing it! IT has ALWAYS been those 2 reasons when it comes to Apple devices!
Great concept but I still can't choose which parts I want in a new laptop and I actually need an optical drive...out of the market FFS?
Me who has a PC "I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you"
Intel. Enough said.
wow
I’m VERY impressed‼️👍🏻 they are setting the new STANDARD‼️👍🏻 When I finally need to buy a new laptop, I’ll be looking at their line up.
This got a like and comment because this deserves to be seen
So now we got a laptop which is more upgradable, than Apple's desktop computers... With that out of the way, this thing does look attractive, it stands to see how long the proprietary upgrade parts stay available.
finally something innovative in the laptop market
I hate working on Laptops, after opening a couple, I now refuse to do hardware repair on laptops. I will do software repair, but nothing that requires me to open them. This Laptop however is a gamechanger. If all laptops were like this one, I would gladly do laptop repair, but until companies start following after this design, it will be awhile before I am fixing any laptop hardware issues.
Apples end is officially on track now. Tell me this isn’t the start of the end of apples garbage
11:53 alright my compliments to whoever edited this part. Luckily I was between sips of my water.
This needs to be launched throughout the world
One of the most exciting products I've seen in years!!  In a time when even cars are becoming unupgradable is nice to see something like this! P.S. I tried to go and configure one and the website still needs some work in functionality!
This laptop ACTUALLY feels futuristic isteady of "older modular technology"
This is new. This could be good if framework succeds, it would force others to stop screwing us around with minimal upgradeability and might prolong time before we need to buy new laptop.
Freakingtastic upgradability!
Happy Louis Rossmann noises!
When my surface dies, I want One of these.
unfortunately I already bought a new laptop before I saw this
No one on yt has mastered unpredictable  sponsor segways like linus  That is fact
the websites configurator doesn't work rn so i cant order one. :( how many of the 1million that watched this video in 24hrs since upload bought one?  they probably got absolutely flooded with ordered and disabled the configurator.
>Yet another cool idea that's still only using expensive high-end hardware.  Oh boy. I'm sure this will last and not be forgotten in just a couple years.
Linus just installed that wifi card like a phsyco
My desktop is more than 6yr old. So I love the concept. I will definitely buy this laptop if its not expensive.
went to the website everyone option errors out and doesnt allow me to select anything lol
Jesus guys I think their website is being overcrowded by people ordering the laptop now XD it’s throwing HTTP 500 errors just like when Epic dropped GTA V :v
If 1,000,000 people who watched would support the I can see these getting available on amazon
If this eventually have risc v swapable socs this would be huge.
I was expecting a GPU module :(
Linus beat the crap out of that laptop and it still runs. (especially that 1TB storage) I am def getting one!!!
17:35 keyboard with fphat anime tiddies
Seems like the frame is already packed with stuff so gpu might be quite hard to stuff it in. As I work with 3d stuff, remind me again when there is a gpu expansion. I don't mind if it's bulky, I need upgradability.
Damn. I love this
Am i the only one who realized that  the camera is better than most other high end laptops. I want to see them improve their keyboard and mouse so it matches high end laptops and see more Modularaty in motherboard,cpu,gpu if people support this thing it will be perfect in the future and the good thing is that people who support this company now won't get disappointed because later they will be able to upgrade to the amazing new parts that they helped funding.  And yet the price for what do you get right now is incredible. I'm buying parts to build a pc when i need laptop in future this will be it thank god i didn't buy a laptop.
When you can't order one lol
Every time this type of awesome thing done by one Manufacturer, Everyone be like, "Wow this is awesome" And nobody buys it.
QR codes are nice but what if someone doesn't have a smartphone, I don't use a smartphone, I think they're bull shit, I can't be bothered with having to keep it charged 24/7 & pay a huge monthly bill on the off chance I need to make a phone call, then you have to replace the damned thing every two years.. It's ridiculous!
Hope they don't charge too much for modules
This is really cool and I won't one. Can't believe you didn't install Linux on it tho
16:56
Excited for this! I hope they would partner with synaptics for a keyboard option with trackpoint
Yes... This is glorious. Just the thing I've been waiting for.
My PC is 11 years old....still fast with 8 i7 cores, 16gm ram, raptor drives....only the video card needs to be upgraded.  Oh, only optical audio out, got a Sony ES da converter to do that and a 5 watt class A headphone amp
That's BRILLANT
ngl the qr code on each component is a good implementation. saves paper
If I buy any laptop, imma buying this with all my money. Its worth spending as i can REPAIR and UPGRADE.
That thing needs to succeed. I really hope this is the future of laptops.
An AMD mainboard please!  Also can we just buy a mainboard and build a SFF computer from one ? that'd be interesting to see.
this has google ara energy and im praying that it doesnt fail this time around
this laptop is actually what we need
If they succeed, they'll get bought out, and then turn to shit. Then no one will make anything like this for another 10-15 years.
I would buy this if I was looking for a casual business/school laptop That premium price for entry though >_> idk, it's a maybe now
If Apple Silicon hadn't completely blown me away, I would be so into this.  Sadly, despite hating Apple, for my current needs I'm waiting on the new Macbook Pro.  For anyone else asking me about a good laptop though, I would totally recommend this.  If they do a chunkier gaming model however, I will potentially be all over that.
Full-size SD card module?
Nirav Patel <3
The Wild West of microchips is here, I am so excited!!
I did not think a laptop would interest me. But this did. Great innovation indeed.
Waiting for a gamers &or developer kit.
Will buy one. ...as soon as I can get it with an AMD APU.
How cool would it be if these components were compatible with a phone too, I'd walk around with a phone with two USB c ports and a full on Displayport, I don't know what I'm gonna do with it but Dammit I want one!!!
Why is the display refresh rate a secret????
This is genuinely incredible. Can't wait to see what they achieve in the future.
the creator of this laptop, definitly a tech wiz & geek 100% hahahaha
gimme
best video in a while
this is sick
my next laptop will be from these guys :)
aMaazing!
Seriously exciting and well-executed. I won't be surprised, however, when it fades from the public eye and doesn't get the market share it deserves.
gimme
you can tell they had fun engineering that thing
This is what it should be like in the future.
note9 still
You should checkout eluktronics as well they are not a modular but very good quality
You can easily upgrade from intel to AMD, pritty cool 😊
Beautiful product
But can it run Apple OS? We need you to Hackintosh it!
17:35 I can definitely see an anime keyboard deck being sold out. They should definitely provide as many customization options because I can see people customizing their laptops like people do with mechanical keyboards or mice.
I’ve never been super excited about laptops and I’ve also never known what to recommend to people. This laptop however IS EXCITING! I would buy it now if it came in a 15 or 16 inch screen size (I’m counting on you Framework!) I’d also love to see if with a bigger model, they could figure out some way to modularize a DGPU and let us install one! But this thing looks like a high-end laptop at a seemingly competitive price with the promise of a nice store to go back to if I ever need to repair or upgrade this thing!
Linus Drop Tips
8:15 linus drop tips
Yes, the laptop we all need in these trying times. Can't wait to see if they'll expand into phones. I hate that I can't open up my phone to change the fucking battery or storage.
Almost everything on this is great. Finally getting real upgradeability and reusability in a laptop. However, the expansion adapters ruin it. All of those included ports could have come pre-installed on the motherboard. some people mentioned less e-waste but this just creates more with extra male/female USB-C ports, extra PCB, plastic casing, and packaging. The big reason most laptops don't have them is space but in this thing, you could make it slimmer and keep all those ports. There would even be enough room to include ALL of those ports plus a more useful PCI-e Expansion slot with the connectors like the GPU uses. With that you could even get a direct connection for a much more powerful external GPU rather than going through USB-C/Thunderbolt. This could even allow you to add Thunderbolt to an AMD system, providing you pay the Intel tax for it. Any further expansion beyond those ports can easily be done with dongles as that is all those are, just dongles with slots to fit them inside. Removing the wasted space from the adapters would also give more room for better cooling, as what is there doesn't look like it would cool the top CPU's without throttling. This kind of reminds me of the Moto Z2 or LG G5 which flopped for the same reason they were made for.
I wish they can design cars like that... what a pipe dream.
I really hope this become a big thing
This is honestly one of the coolest things I’ve seen this year, would love to see more of this in the future. Also would be cool if they had some way to upgrade the motherboard and cpu and just slot it in and easily connect everything.
That has to be one of the best built-in webcams in a laptop. Looks amazing!
Respect Framework, they care about us, you hear that Apple and other brand ????
If next-gen has a touch screen and Ryzen options I'm all in.
GPU?
Hopefully they take exchanges so that when people want to replace their old modules with new ones it doesn't just end up in a landfill somewhere
This should be a new standard ... strangely companies don't care about the environment as much as try care about their profits. Great laptop btw.
Have to say the only thing that impresses me is the tracking pad is in the middle. Little things. Drives me a bit bonkers my Rog has it slightly to the left. The amount of times i have hit the wrong section trying to do something. Because its slightly to the side. But I would not swap my laptop for another. It has built in memory and a Disc Drive ;)/ The last of its kind. Very precious. Built like a body builder and fabulous.
My old laptop has a g2 socket and i can pop the cpu off

No egpu test? What 2as the point of watching this.
I'll probably get one when my laptop stops working. I want it.
i dont have a laptop just my desktop. but this sounds like the perfect laptop for me. gonna need to order one soon
i like what i see on this laptop, but i do wonder about the 'wasted horizontal space' on modules why only 1xUSB-A in module where it can fit 2xUSB-A next to each other  (USB-A 3.1 can fit 2 at USB-C 3.2) the lack of USB 4 may prevent o put e.g. 2x HDMI, 2x DP or combined 1x HDMI 1x DP into single module about display, i agree it needs touchscreen with better IPS/OLED/IGZO type (10bit,HDR, 75-240Hz) also this type of modules isn't unheard of (similar to some of the hardened rugged enterprise ones) yet for end user normal market that's really nice job
Linus: it's the best laptop even if it sucks in performance because it's modular and repairable.  Not saying this one isn't good
Linus:"this my first hand on this thing" This thing:"are you sure about that?"
Framework laptop is the only laptop worth buying. Guys, all laptop internals (CPU, storage, memory, etc.) are commodities and work the same. Product design is the only real differentiator, and this company is categorically different from every other laptop manufacturer in that they actually have the right values motivating their industrial design.
"Oh cock, somebody's nicked my HDMI port"
Dude i fucking hate my laptop for not having a detachable battery option! Its always the first thing to die cuz i play plugged in al the time.
This laptop being “gorgeous” is a little bit of a stretch but I still get it
Was that zoom on his face NOT slightly to close? Wouldn't your brain screen at you "whoops, slightly to far"? Hmm... Maybe that's the point.
2:19 never seen Linus so excited about a screwdriver. Amazing 😂👍
if they can upgrade their mainboard to a superpowerful performance processor + graphic  moveable pc by using mainboard + battery space , i will buy it !
Dank.
This video hugged the DIY configurator to death so :good_job:
Thinnest portable PC case with integrated screen and with Laptop processor and inbuilt power module.
Saw an ad for this like a week ago, so excited!!!!
I am 500% sold
WOW!!
Damn that Note 9 still going
This has to be the future of laptops !
Linus looks like a kid in the candy land.
DELL wasn't harm in this video!
Linus remembering Louis Rossmann at 9:48
say what you want, but this barely any better than some hp and dell laptops you can buy today that have replaceable batteries, ssd's, ram, and wifi cards. until this company gives the option to buy parts like the motherboard, battery, screen ect. it's repairability is worse than them. their website claims that the warranty won't be honored if you don't use their certified parts. only when they provide the schematic will they truly be a company that lives up to what they claim to stand for. and not being able to replace the cpu is very clearly NOT completely upgradeable, although it's a very common compromise. you can still buy new laptops that take desktop cpu's in a socket. the modular IO thing is cool I guess, but there isn't enough ports overall, and you plug these ports into other ports mounted right on the board.
The not 720p webcam was just the cherry on top.
W : Let's hire someone that can actually - at least - disassemble laptops   HR : How to do that? Test? Engineer : hold my beer  5:05
I was gonna order one but the site isnt working cause too many people want one lmao
Yes. This is a good progress for the Rights to Repair.  F*ck you CrApple
500 server error nooooo
There are a lot of USB C magnet cables that u plug in and the cable just sticks to the connector. So basically everything covered. Dang this thing looks really good and as soon as i can i am gonna get one
what kind colorful desk pad do you use? where i can buy it?
well to be fair apple spent billions on engineering a laptop you cannot fix.. period.. they spend billions lobbying and dumbing down end users so we wont keep a laptop for 3 to 8 years
Sadly this won't succeed for some time. This is an amazing laptop for people like Linus and us who like such options. 99% of the population just want a laptop that does video conferencing and make PPTs.
The major thing is this company has to stick around, parts availability have to be long-term.  I'm seriously considering buying one; I don't need one right off the bat but I want to support this company.
I think this video crashed their website!
Sounds like a perfect business laptop that is upgradeable. With a ryzen CPU this should be a beast. Finally a 64GB DDR4 sodimm
The main issue with this type of laptop is the adoption rate and support. Will the company still be around to support upgradeable modular parts especially for the CPU/motherboard component if I were to upgrade it 2~3 years or even 5 years down the road? Without third party support, you can only hope that the company may still be around or continue to make new and replaceable modular parts to prolong their support for this laptop.
I can't wait to buy this when it comes out seriously these types of computers need to be supported, I literally couldn't fix a guy's HP laptop because the SSD was proprietary 😔, we need things like this to force companies to adapt or expire
I just want something to tinker with where it feels like your're not doing something you are supposed to do with the product. My best experience with this is modding my old ps vita.(until it died :(...)
1:58 that poor phone, you can tell it was dropped a lot
Their website is terrible.
You know it's a good product when the comments on the video is actually about the product and not some meme comments.
Be gentle with it please :(
This is so awesome! It does seem to be lacking in the gpu department but I would be completely okay with that if they have a way to maximize use of plugging in an external docked GPU which I can completely see them being able to do. I love that you can disconnect the battery as someone who works online and travels a lot I use my laptop as my main machine and have it "docked" especially during these times almost all the time and on plugged in power. Being able to configure the ports is also great. I cannot wait to see their next option.
how much do I get from these laptops if I mind for a day Bitcoin plz hit back
Yet another overpriced and unusable mess shilled by soynus instead of the pinebook pro
This laptop has the potential to bring drastic changes in the Hackintosh Community. I will surely try Mac OS in this laptop.
11:50
This is reeeaaalllyy making me interesting.
That would be awesome to have a MagSafe compatible slot in port
Finally got the email saying my DYI edition is about to ship! Excited! :)
A laptop made for Mutahar
I would like to design my own laptop case, they generously share the cad. Now i can have my own thicc custom case laptop. Do they make ryzen version too?
If this company fails, we as consumers deserve garbage.
17:14 Activate Windows
I would like to see Anthony do a Linux install on the DIY Framework please. Also a long term review next year. Thank you
Jesus this is awesome.  Reminds me of the phone blocks concept
i belive the framework site is struggling because of this rn
I've been waiting for so long for something like this. Excited like a kid on Christmas and I don't even own it yet.
Just give me an AMD SoC and make that 3x2 display run 120hz Freesync and I'm in.
I like this product a lot 😁😁
I’m sold, Linus caved in the middle of a video. Let’s go boiz
AMD version of this laptop would be nice to have :)
hi
11:52 i lol'd
Well, I'll buy it next year! It looks perfect
I'd get one if I had the need for a new device or the budget to just get another one. Very cool, will keep them in mind in the future!
The best question is, will it run windows 11?
Man this guy talks soo much then the parts that has on laptops
Needs a bit more work on the design and rigidity
Linus is really happy playing with his new Lego set!
Definitely gunna buy 1
I went to buy one, right after seeing this video - and the website was crashed 😂 I suspect the enormous traffic this video generated played a role in that!
This looks so good. Such a shame they will disappear in 3 years.
11:53
This is the sequel to the panasonic toughbook
Love the concept, disappointed that the one thing that forces most laptop replacements is still an issue though, no replaceable discrete gpu.  I've made a long career of laptop repair and support, and my thoughts are this:   Other than the slottable usb-c dongles, the rest is already replaceable in many laptops.  Without a replaceable d-gpu, most consumer laptops are still going to end in a landfill or recycling center every time it won't play the games people want (and a lot of business class laptop users don't need most of this anyway, the memory, wifi card, drives and batteries are pretty accessible on most laptops, even if they take 9 screws instead of 5).
AND THEY ARE WORKING FOR LINUX SUPPORT LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wish they made an AMD version with one of the newer APU's.
dang Framework is 🔥
I wish every laptop manufacturer would do it. Maybe not modular but at least easily upgradable. Using glue feels like a cheap fix, everything should be either slot in or screw in.
I saw this last year on YouTube on a small channel and I was pretty impressed with the execution. And I am glad that someone as yourself who has such a reach and impact has covered this. More people because of you will be informed about this tech.
Algorithm
To all the people saying there's no innovation in laptops nowadays.
Glad to see this being featured and trending pretty well, this is a such a great concept. I'm pretty committed to the Apple ecosystem (very happy with it) but still wish them great success and hope they can help change the industry.
I wish I had enough money for a good computer. But I don't and I am stuck with a computer DELL that I have to keep repairing.
100 C or F ?
Does anyone know what the screensaver/video at 00:19 is ? I've always seen it but don't know anything about it. Cheers
its a nice thought but a 750 dollar laptop with no graphics card and only offering an intel chip with it?  it seems very gimmicky.  this video seems more like a baised review, barely put any emphasis on the flaws and noting minimal stupid things to play down the short comings.    can't upgrade the processor, no option for dedicated graphics card.  those are the upgrades that extend the life.  i don't see a point in purchasing this at this price point with its capabilities.
This laptop give me goosebumps! I'm going to support this company as well!
All this needs is an AMD model, then it will be perfect.  EDIT: A touchscreen too.
please build a modular GPU unit.
This so reminds me of the videos about Phone DIY kits you can get if you visit China and the districts there. Nice that this is going to have an American wherehouse for inventory!  What it lacks is the Voice/Dictation AI that turns it into Skynet in the next release!
"why do i use wired mouse" - Linus Sebastian
the site is "broken"  can't access the pc builder, I guess it's the Linus effect ? :)
I do electronic repair. My idi ot hand absolutely could and have repaired a macbook.
The only thing I don't like about it is that it's not a Mac.
No VGA module? *ABSOLUTE GARBAGE*
A big thumbs up to framework and thanks Linus for covering this product.  BTW I heard about this company from Louis Rossmann and was waiting for more reviews to trickle down.  Chao!
7:40 he spitting facts i do that same shit
i'm a noob to the tech spec of pc in général so i don't understand the gpu performance and for what usage  this beautiful pc is  but it is very interesting that it is affordable and way more modular than any laptop on the market just the fact that you can choose on witch side of the laptop you want your i/o and what type of i/o you want it's awesome you don't have to choose between having an ultra laptop or enough i/o without using a dongle hub
_"They have a strong framework"_ By Man
or for the magnetic, ya could get some of those USB c magnetic adapters and just slot those into the default module and cord Idk just an idea.
8:18 classic linus.
If they add a 360 hinge and Wacom's EMR option to their display later I'll daily drive it.
Seems too good to be true, man I have been hoping for a laptop like this forever, too bad I won't have much use for it, so I probably won't be getting one, but I defiantly want one lol.
Fucking finally.
the future is now
17:32 Ah yes, Gacha Laptops
Framework should give Linus 1% ownership for this video because I guarantee they'll see a huge spike in revenue because of this.
Laptops that you can upgrade and not just chuck into the landfill when something fails, finally
It's a pity up-gradable graphics modules never became popular for laptops.
to bad we can upgrade it the Ryzen...
wow i love this so fucking much
Haven't you people bought the Asus Rog strix scar 17 ? If not then why? Please make a video on it please LTT.
Kudos. This is the Linus we all love!
3:44 Theres also the FAT?
We have seen modular phones, which was flop. But this one is actually real nuts 🤯. Will surely buy one if it comes to my location
I'd actually like to see Louis review one of these.
i want to support a company that's giving options for customer
Framework, please come to India.
omfg, I've been waiting for a modular upgradable laptop. I've had my hopes stepped on and covered in donkey crap so many times...this is the first actual time I've seen a physically working modular laptop
Please let this be the future of laptops!
How do you manage to misspell upgradable  Seems to be a correct spelling, just not one I have ever seen before. Also it looks gross
oh look capitalism being the issue until people took the issue into their own hands
My wife needs a new laptop, so I figured this would be perfect. At the very least, I'd give her mine, and take this one... Then I tried to use their trash website. After clicking the "Configure Now" link about 20 times, I was finally taken to the customization page. Hit next after selecting the first option, crashed. Repeat 2 more times, same result. Then decided to go the DIY route, same story, except it took about 100 clicks to get past the "Configure Now" link. At this point, they'd have to pay me to get one of these laptops. It's a shame too, I've been asking for this exact thing for years.
I wondered that was a sponsor, a gorgeous one
I need this
RIP Framework...I was so excited when I saw this video...jumped on the website immediately to see what I could configure, only to face disappointment from their absolute TURD BURGER of a website. I've seen more impressive sites from scammers. EVERY SINGLE selection of ANY configuration option caused their configuration app to crash. What a painful nightmare! I have to question the reliability of hardware provided by a company who can't even get a BASIC web app right! I understand that your video may have caused a surge in website visitors, but come on! You can't convince me that the volume of visitors at 10 PM MDT is overloading the ordering app for a hackable laptop...not exactly an iPhone, is it? So unless their site is running off of a Raspberry Pi 2, I really don't get it. There's simply no excuse left for them to use in mid 2021, with dirt cheap scalable hosting plans available everywhere. How long can they possibly last?  Not your fault Linus, but since I heard about it here, just thought you should know what you're promoting. Just such a disappointment when a great idea dies because of bad management decisions, and companies trying to cheap out on the most basic things...
I forgot linus owns the one of the few channels that actually gets 2 sponsors per video
FULL SIZE PORTS!!!
OI! Don't you be dissing Fairphone!
Dude, come on. All the things in the bios, all the things about the qr codes on the components, and a lot of other things are something that Dell does. Yes, the modular stuff is pretty awesome by itself, and it actually makes me want this product on its own. You don't have to pretend like it's so much easier to take apart. Laptops are pretty easy to take apart already.
FRAMEWORK PLEASE SELL IN MALAYSIA
Would be amazing with a little more refinement. Instead of swapping single IO, one side of the laptop should have a replaceable IO bar. It can be specced with audiophile amps, silly amounts of USB connectors or an engineer spec complete with com ports, VGA and passive and driven fused programmable IO. On the other side they can have a single replaceable charging port of the current standard, i.e. C.
It won't succeed because it's more expensive and bigger than a tailor made product. Just like the RED modular phone or all the other modular crap. The point is people need some ports and that's about it. People don't need to change a port out after 6 months of use.
Where can I get one?
I will buy this once I have enough money
My Eluktronics laptop may be getting a bit dated by this point, but it's kind of cool that it uses a DESKTOP version Core i7-7700 and a DESKTOP version GTX 1060 6GB. Still has a compact form factor and battery life at least as good as you'd expect considering the specs. Temps are also surprisingly good for laptop parts operating in a small space. Plenty of storage upgradeability. I won't upgrade anytime soon.
👽?
when linus said he, "didn't like Type A on the right because of his mouse," that hit home
god! i love that company but, i can't afford it because, i already bought a bad acer laptop. imma cry in my room corner😭😭😭
This is amazing. I might have to consider getting one once they're able to integrate better graphics performance in it.
been waiting for a startup that takes this approach. gonna try to invest. this IS going to be the successfull path forward for laptops.
It's just simple This is what people want No company acknowledges that
The screeching request synthetically disapprove because servant family prepare but a imported legal. literate, possible manx
The site don't even work 🥲
Fingerprint good on linux, what about everything else? Anthony, please answer me! :-D I might be keen.
FULL REVIEW! FULL REVIEW! FULL REVIEW!
Just wanted to add this.. Those BIOS features were in lenovo's BIOS for years.. This laptop is pretty cool ;)
1080p webcam?!?????
I want to remove the headphone jack, though. 🙁
my only gripe is lack of dedicated graphics. This is great otherwise and is the reason I loved my Alienware 17r1(Ranger). Have all the upgrade options I could’ve imagined; CPU, GPU, msata SSD, 2.5” SSDs, aftermarket copper heatsinks. This is in the right direction. I still want more though.
Their website doesn't work yet. You can't buy one. I wanted to buy one tonight Apple can go die in a corner!
I'd definitely buy a gaming laptop from framework
alright I want one
their website doesn't even work properly.....
This is literally Linus' Christmas in July lol
This laptop looks awesome. Once a higher refresh rate / brighter screen is out, this is definitely a cop
We need a gaming version.
APPLE .. take note.
Please please let this be successful so it can go to other countries as well 😭  I want this in my country 😞
This is amazing! I'm an IT tech and genuinely love everything that they are doing with this, especially the ability to remove the mainboard and turn it into a tv box /small desktop, I've done MAAAANY builds like that but it's always a struggle finding boards that work that way for one reason or another, including that is something I NEVER thought a company would do
I think I have to buy their stock before it skyrocketing 🚀🚀🚀🚀    *selling DELL first
13.7 million?
go framework... what a nice future that i hope.....
Thank you for timestamps Dennis :)
*_“A COMPLETELY Upgradeable Laptop?”_* So, uh... No, then.  Not even close.
I want to see these guys make a gaming laptop so you can swap out the GPU when it gets too old or just borks.
I kinda want one. This is the way the future should go."
If they include ryzen soon and make it available in the philippine market, im getting one if i had the money 💸
I hope this going to be next big thing
Love from Sri Lanka, I wish this company will success !!!
Finally, something to challenge my Inspiron 1120!
Disclaimer: Apple wasn't harmed in the making of this video
Aayyyyy I just decided to move to Langley :D
does it have TPM 2.0 thou?
Every tech device ever should be done exactly like this. Huge shout out to Louis Rossmann and LMG for getting the word out on right to repair and making a huge difference. Thank you guys from the bottom of my heart.
Am I crazy or that's like top ten webcam of all laptop market?
please buy this to promote this kind of business
Want
Make a gaming variant and I will consider. As of right now, im wary of anything modular. Look at how many modular concepts came about in the 2010s and never came to fruition.
Just tried to customize and order one. The website just said sorry something went wrong everytime I selected an option and refreshed the page and would not let me add a preselected one to cart either.
Kindve annoying title.
Beautiful!
A Segway to the sponsor?  Do they still make those? Maybe bicycle?
Those "excuses" never held water.  Was just lazy shitty design.
LINUS TECH TIPS            gimme
I'm struggling to remember another time when Linus was this excited. Same here.
I'd have loved this at my last job. They swapped out all the desktops where they could for (admittedly decent) Lenovo ultrabooks but --if-- when something went wrong they were a pain to repair. Especially the hinges. Oi... That degree of modularity and upgradeability is a godsend in a corporate environment. You keep spare parts rather than spare devices and have the system fixed and back to the user in potentially minutes rather than days. Then there's another use case - older folks. My parents both have newer laptops they won't use as things are in different places and they aren't used to them. Being able to swap out the mainboard for a new, upgraded one yet keep the original device layout? Glorious.
Hey Framework team, my next laptop is going to be from you guys, just because of the concept. You guys rock!
if only I needed a laptop, I would be in
I would buy this for non-gaming.
1:38 ...Got hand it to Linus. He KNOWS he drops equipment all the time, so he is now always very careful and never does anything stupid with devices in his hands anymore these days. /s
I have some janky dell inspiron 5999 and it is a nightmare to take apart. The plastic snapped the first time I took it apart. So I think we can agree dell sucks when it comes to upgradeability.
This is the *the anti mac!* /apple product.
Pure piffle.
Imagine building a product to allow consumers to repair as needed.  what a concept!  Lol thank you Frameworks 👍
tl;dr: way overdue it feels like a troll  This would've been groundbreaking in 2000...The reason it takes this long is because manufacturers don't really care about you or the environment. It really doesn't take too much to go modular nor should it be a thing that's so niche only a few companies are willing to try it out. Anytime I see a soldered cpu/ram I cry a little. Hell there's been a formfactor for mobile gpus for who knows how long I have an old elitebook from the early 2000s that you can upgrade because it's mxm, then you wanna know what the assholes at HP did, they whitelisted their own gpus. You can fit a gpu/heatsink/fan in a thing the size of an old drive bay(dvd etc) and make it the new GPU slot. Something standardized maybe even a dock. Here's what my Legion5 can do, it can play games of now(just barely too) but everything is soldered on, to add insult to injury even cracking the case open is tedious(I commend the Zbook line, which use to be the Elitebook line for giving us a 0 screw latch).   Rant over...
Just like Lego
Legit, if I ever need an ‘ultra book’, Im getting this. 🖤👌
I think your review managed to crash their site.
5:50 *This should be the new standard.*
As a certified apple tech, this would be amazing to have on modern macbooks
Their website can't process orders ATM so I hope it's because of demand
"I love that the fans ramp up, instead of letting the CPU just get to 100°C." That sentence hurt. A lot.
Oh God, with this new laptop, we're gonna have Theseus' laptop!
In collaborative coding is mandatory to put clues all over your work, and in general is a good practice, so a future programmer save tons of days figuring out your code.
This is just amazing
What can it handle game wise?
I just bought a laptop and I'm about to sell it and some other stuff to get this one.
Being that the right to repair is the future, this Notebook is the future
Activate Windows.
APPLE SHOULD LEARN! Louis Rossman should do a video about it
Are there users that buy a laptop without a real gpu these days?  I couldnt imagine paying 1k++ without having a real gpu that can deliver performance.   Like the idea though, even if knowing what u need makes this useless imho. Just got an Asus ROG scar 15 2021 G533QS. Cant see anything that would need customization on this setup. E.g. the USBC acts as Displayoutput. So there is so need to swap something as it can be used for HDMI or Displayport (without the need of those 2 upgrade parts). Clean on the right side (i/o is on left and back) Optical mechanical keyboard (try to upgrade this) 2TB SSD Raid (enough to me, also upgradeable without bandwidth loss like from the upgradeable laptop) so the only benefit is that u can choose i/o ports which isnt needed cuz u only gain the HDMI / Displayport choice which is obsolete by having usbc displayoutput (which can deliver both as mentioned). not mentioning the 300fps ips display that cant be upgraded on this one and more.  rly good features that are usefull: Hardwareswitch for mic and the option to disable the battery in the bios. im not against it, dont get me wrong, i just dont see the WOW effect, as the mainparts that decide if ur laptop is still good (CPU and GPU) arent modular. and any laptop can upgrade to ssd/nvme and upgrade the ram, so by choosing this one u gain modular Display i/o and u can decide on which side the usbs should be, amazing ^^  i also dont think its handy to repair, cuz what will happen, instead of having a dead usb or whatever, u just have a dead upgradeslot - which is the same right? On the other hand i guess its easier to resolder a new usb to the board instead of resoldering the upgradeable slot from this laptop here which is far more inside and by this harder to work on (easier to damage the board and surrounding chips then). only benefit is, lets say ur displayout is broken, with that laptop u still got 3 other trys by using the other 3 upgradeslots.
11:34 Dell 🤣🤣
Oh wow look its an ugradable laptop. Look what they can do that other manufacturers avoid. Matchy screws, few screws. boom. Uuuh ok.  So the upgradable bit is the expansion modules for u to choose between USB A/C or HDMI or display port? Ram and SSD options are good but a lot of brands still allow that.   You cant upgrade the MOBO or CPU so i dont think we are still there. This isnt worth the money yet
anyone in viewers own frameworks laptop
this is a cool concept, but it’s still not worth the price at all. literally $750 with a $100 deposit just for an i5-1135g7. and then u still have to get most of the other parts and build it yourself. it’s literally just using a concept that no other companies have so they can raise the price as high as they want and people still have to overpay if they want a laptop like this.
i just gotta say he looks dope with his beard
Is it available in India???? I really want it. If anyone knows something please tell🙏🏻
I wish this company great success. We need more of this! I am eyeballing this company and know what to recommend now! I'd love to see some sort of GPU mod.
Im buying one. This is the future
pretty sure the LTT community crashed the framework servers lol i cant use the site to order one!
Switching Ports Between Ports Leaving Dongles In The Dust Lmao
Next laptop I buy… is definitely gonna be one of these. Hands down. Screw apple.
i love when Linus reviews a tech and get so psyched about it. it means Linus approve that tech thing
That's all good to know but for me the most important thing is how long a company will produce mechanical spare parts for the laptop. eg at my old laptop they stopped manufacturing the damn hinges and guess what at my laptop they broke, couldn't find any and i had to look up for a tig welder in order to fix them.
That camera is really good. For whatever amount of reviews I've seen is great.
They should name a model "The Rossmann"
All it needs is an MXM slot and I'm sold.
I mean wow with my jaw drop, customisable yeah! Take my money!
Missed opportunity for it to not run Linux as an option.
So based
this is basically dbrand but for laptop components
I'd buy a 15 inch with 6 ports and colour accurate display.
They do talk about CPU upgrades. They say they will manufacture motherboards and even better cooling systems with them. I was reading the wedsite
I like their frame work.  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
MY NEXT LAPTOP :P
I'm not buying any other laptop but something like THIS from now on!
Framework and Dbrand should merge so we would have fully customizable laptop.
Very interesting and great for the future of laptops... I hope someone will develop a graphics chip socket, allowing modular, upgradeable (dedicated) graphics in laptops :D
How about a custom LTT bezel for Framework laptops on LTTstore.com ? What will make this really take off is when the aftermarket embraces it. If it becomes a trendy thing to customize, they're going to sell the hell out of them. I've been waiting on this video since I saw it a couple months ago on Adam Savage's Tested channel.
I want this to take off so bad
14:14 tl;dw
Love it, website is a bit wonky, but I have high hopes.
The price isn't even a compromise
this is what happened when a company doesn't focus on profit. The other thing is being out of business.
Wow. The QR codes are a great idea. And color codes screws?? AND extras. This is getting me all hot & bothered
I want one lol. I honestly think this might be the perfect thin and light laptop. I hope they sell a lot of these so that they can have a gaming chassis version with a dedicated GPU and maybe an AMD CPU option.
LINUS!!! YOU BROUGHT DOWN THEIR WEBPAGE. HAHAHAHA
I think the original Magsafe patent expired
Man I wish there was a Framework Gaming Laptop! That would be so cool!
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS LAPTOP.  Like even tho the CPU isnt upgradeable, you could just buy a new frame alone that has the CPU and take all of the old components and swap them in. Which is still hella easy and probably a lot freaking cheaper! If I ever get another laptop. THIS is what im getting
I want one so bad. Take my 💰
I think the only thing that holds me back for framework is the lack of dGPU (and I only need a mild one), but I’m sure by the time my current laptop starts to feel old Framework will have something for me, so that’s cool
I have a Lenovo T450, it works great as a business laptop, but not the best for multi tab/music/pdf/video combo. Yeah… I have ADD, but this is looking to be a promising upgrade.
i would to see a 3d printed case for the motherboard
Dell publicly stated multiple times: OEMs all use proprietary parts and connectors and they have to. Well, big F. U. to Dell and Apple and all the other greedy manufacturers.
Waiting for this to come to Australia. Fingers crossed for good Linux drivers.
Linus, you shouldn't invest as if people find out you did, the review can't be trusted as you can praise it up for your own interest for example a lot of YouTubers are praising the freedom phone and telling viewers to buy it when it is a scam. and they do it because they get $50 per phone that is sold from their link.
Does this have a eGPU support ? 😄 Edit: I saw this video like 9hrs ago and I remember to ask question now 😵‍💫 😂😂😂
What I want to hear: Upgradeable Laptop VGA !
0:00 if you buy a device for the aesthetics instead of functionality, please remove yourself from the gene pool.
Linus what anime do you watch if you do.
I think the website from the video is throttling the framework website rn
Modular gaming laptop framework?🤞
This is like merging laptop and desktop.
The right to repair... as a laptop
One major missing feature:  GPU options.
Awesome😎
Honestly if this was 2 or 3 times more expensive than it is Im still getting one, thank you so much! This will be the last laptop I ever have to buy <3
My dell business class lattitude e6440 laptop from 2013 is almost completely modular and super easy to repair and upgrade.  You can even upgrade the CPU.  The precision line of laptop even had an upgradable GPUs. I bought mine off ebay and upgraded the cpu, ram, lcd, finger print reader, back lit keyboard, internal cellular card, wifi card, expresscard and added 3 ssds, also the screws are labeled and the online manual shows you have to replace every component.  I have been so spoiled i hate consumer grade laptops.  I can also use 4 different chargers from 60, 90, 120, 210 watt.  I have 4 battery options and it only takes 3 screws to take the back cover off.
Oh god please let this become a thing. We need more of this. Apple must be rolling in its grave, too much modularity...  ah Tim's eyes are burning
My last laptop I bought in 2017, touch screen is important to me with the using in the garage and looking at wire diagrams, I will look up this company and save them and hopefully this may be my next instead of another used Dell Inspiron
Imagine if they let you keep the same enclosure but just sells motherboards that you would swap out to upgrade with. They could also sell a pre-built system enclosure so if people don't want to get a laptop, they could just get a little system unit with laptop parts inside. From the looks of it, the only thing missing is an ultra budget option with a Pentium or Celeron inside for those on a really tight budget.
just buy a volta cable, charging problem solved, boy am i ever happy i bought a volta cable
This is the type of company I would support. I already have a laptop but if it ever broke down, I’ll definitely buy this one.
I am very interested in this product but there's few issues that makes me hesitant to switch. I love the modular approach (I don't need hdmi, headphone jack, webcam, etc but I gotta spend on it like other folks) and especially interesting is the potential upgradeability which might even save me money in the long run even if I spend a bit more initially. Getting the features I want without spending more for extras I don't want can be a big deal.  1) Future proofing. I used to have a lenovo y500 laptop which lenovo claimed to support swappable/upgradeable gfx cards and other modules but immediately stopped supporting and the 2nd hand "upgrades" cost way too much so I got stuck with a mediocre laptop with no way to upgrade it. I am worried about compatibility issues too once v2 comes along.   2) Gaming. From the design, it doesn't look like it will support any dedicated gfx cards. I hope they either design a "G" model for gaming even if it's chonkier for cooling and other necessary parts like the gfx. Or maybe they can go the egpu route like asus' flowx13 and have a module that will support an egpu that can be plugged in for demanding games.  3) Durability. Laptops can be quite the fragile thing but can many can withstand some light physical abuse. I wonder if this won't shatter into a million pieces if you drop it or something.  I love the potential and hope they can develop something satisfactory for me once the steam decks come out because I will be switching laptops by then. Really hope they can provide a good gaming solution.
this is indeed cool. or maybe I long for the time when this was/will_be so normal that this won't be cool anymore
So it is fully upgradable unlike alien ware.
This need to success and go with Linux too
Wow, this is truly amazing!
Oh well I check the website hoping to pre-order. But I'm in Australia...
I’m trying to save for a pc can u give me tips for best parts for a “good” pc for under $800
Louis Rossman is frothing at the mouth right now.
This does look really cool. Until you see "intel iris pro graphics".
Flimsy? My "2010" notebook is a solid brick, so solid I can probably throw it and break someone bone. big and ugly, I can agree, however... Flimsy?
If anything this is a good thing for Apple. Now when people complain about right to repair, Apple can just say, “well, you have an option” even though the market demographic that’s going to buy these things was never going to buy Apple in the first place. Frameworks will remain a relative niche product in terms of market share. The best they can do is nock out some of apple’s PC competition. Win/win for Apple.  Tim Cook lying in his pile of money:  🙄 have fun with your computer legos, nerds. You aren’t event the ones we are aiming for.
4:01 Nice save there ;)
I heard…. *cough* Adele….. why would you want her to have upgradability ?
This laptop has seriously peaked my interest
Maybe a completely different sized chassis could be added, 15.6” or 17.3”, keyboard could get a numpad option on those sizes and my god this a cool company, i want one but dont have 750$ to spend
that thing is a dream come true. WOW  definitely keeping these folks in mind for a laptop in the future. this is AMAZING
Finally, a manufacturer that ACTUALLY seems to care about the environment, instead of just saying that they do.
we did it! I cannot even load their configurator. I hope all the business from Linus will help them succeed. Will wait and order.
dongles? modular!
holy smoke, i want one
it comes without Windows !
I mean, my last 3 laptops have had socketed CPUs, so I don't know what you mean when you say they don't. they're intel M series mobile chips too. so I have no idea what you mean they don't make socketed laptop chips
This is the greatest laptop I’ve ever seen. I wanna work with these guys lol
Make it phat and give me a dedicated GPU and more battery along with GPU and CPU/motherboard upgrade possibility and I'll be very excited.
If only this available overseas
Frameworks Management getting hit by that preorderwave of ethusiastic LTT-Fans: S T O N K S!
My 7 year old laptop has the same upgradability and more I/O lmao
If it gets arm and or risc, im gonna buy it.
11:34 lol this made me laugh so hard
Darn it! I just bought a laptop. If only my laptop didn't die on me I would have waited and bought this one instead.
Commenting so that the algorithm picks it up.
About bloody time!
you know its a good product when Linus orders it immediately lmao
The fact that the webcam is so great surprised me the most
Crazy machine. Got to have one
linus chainsaw noise sebastion eh
Can this Framework work with Ryzen since it relies on Thunderbolt?
Hey Linus, are there any windows laptops you'd recommend for a budget as tight as.. $50 😐.
I'd honestly consider this if it's still going when I'm due for a new laptop
I was first drawn to this by the gear on the back I just like those logo thing
Im sold
Can you game on it?
From building pcs to building laptops Linus sure has grown up
Him saying that the fingerprint scanner supports Linux sold to me
Such a shame that their website doesn't work :(
Framework: let us build a good laptop which is sustainable in the long term and good for environment  Meanwhile apple: Let's remove chargers and make them buy it separately! Easy 💰💰
the only thing holding me back at this point is the lack of discrete GPU option
Ryzen, and external GPU's upgradable motherboards heaven. I love these guys.
Half the say thats pretty dope and if I was in the market for a laptop I'd definitely buy one
the option to run your device off of outlet power to save battery health should be standard on every laptop and smartphone  sony does it and so does lenovo but i wish my Samsung had it so would rarely need to use the battery
The next step is Upgradable gaming laptop
The Cheap version is sold already... ALL OF IT, THANKS LINUS.
Fuck yeah I'm sold.
Tim Cook is probably gonna try to shut this down;
As an ex repair tech who has repaired thousands of laptops and seen the worst Dell, HP and others have to offer, this is incredible. Now make a touchscreen display with 360° hinges, modules with multiple ports in a single card, and a 15" version with expandable graphics.
Why does this feel fake 🤔
Pretty amazing. Hope they have all the success!
I want one of these! Time to save up! :D
the framework site is down, probably from the onslaught of ltt viewers throwing their money at it
16:32 one benefit of having a battery disconnect & power on on AC connect is when you want to use the laptop as a low-powered homeserver for Plex, PiHole, NAS whatever service you can think of. You'd want it to automatically power on again after a power outage so you don't have to physically find it and push a button. That way you can chuck it in some corner of your house and never have to worry about it again
😎Yup, this one is cool.
I'm sold too
I think I just found my next laptop. Just checked out their website and the price is actually less than I expected. I am very impressed with this.
After tearing down laptops in at work for the last six years, and repairing them for about 15 years, all I can say is "HELL YEAH !!" yes, I shouted.
alright linus, tell us the story about your note9. why is the back shattered. yeah maybe just an iPad 2 a while ago, but now we have a new case
$750 affordable??? Maybe if they have a $350 model variant
Amazing, my only gripe was the lack of crab rave speaker review
I'm sold on that camera alone. Enough said.
We need to know about updates to this laptop parts as they are available
"You just gotta giver" - Linus 2021
I think I know what my next laptop is gonna be...
So, do we think they'll upgrade the motherboard with similar dimensions? Easily upgrade without setting a whole chassis to waste.
I need a new laptop for school and this is almost exactly like something I imagined a few years ago. The price is super competitive also. I might just apply there.
The perfect laptop doesn't exi...
Damn, I bought my laptop at the wrong time of year...
Thanks MC for Price gouging…
"... their direct to consumer model..." "Thanks to microcenter for sponsoring this video!"
The Legendary LinusTechTips segway :D :D :D
Nice one 👍👍🔥
Cough (DELL)😂😂😂😂😂
LINUX compatible.  I had to jump through hoops to get my wife's ASUS studio book to run linux
really fucking cool
I really want this to succeed so that more things become customizable and upgradeable. The amount of waste on electronics is appalling.
Now this is a laptop I’d buy
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
looks like linus dropped his phone lol
I think he likes it.
Comment
11:55 that was oddly terrifying
Ex big company engr makes upgradable laptop Big companies: time to buy them off
I am literally a fan of the framework now. I hope they deliver their products to India someday.
Yes Thank you FRAMEWORK TEAM. <3. so sick of ROG this ROG that Dell This Razer That BS.
1:38 😮 😮‍💨
why does this whole video feel like an ad
I tried to repair the power plug of an Asus gaming laptop 10 years ago. It's still in 100 pieces in my closet somewhere. This modular laptop is a great idea, just give us some discrete graphics please!
Wish this had TB4. Might still buy one and wait for it.
Will a pc survive underwater ?
Never seen Linus have that many orgasms in one video. Framework's definitely got a great first impression with that!
what is your fav anime linus ?
I want one! And I def want the battery disable!
This is now my top option for when i finally upgrade my laptop.
I’m going to buy this as my laptop for writing weird fan fictions
This is fucking brilliant.
Oh no, Lenovo engineers worked on this
Louis Rossman has entered the chat
Making tech gadgets thin is overrated in my opinion.....
Doo-dad-Ma-jigs… might not be word….. but it is an emotion.
What a revelation, keep the motherboard footprint the same form factor.....
Personally one of the things I wish phone manufacturers did was go back to removable batteries. I remember when my dad had an HTC and was using it heavily he'd just have 2 batteries so he could just quickly replace the battery and continue on. Especially when my main problem with having to get new phones is the battery, it's really nice
U broky it
Please activate the Windows.
Hopefully they'll add AMD options down the road!
aww they didnt anticipate this amount of interest, me wanna build a laptop!
That's how good it is, Linus buying one on the unit they sent them.
Marry me Framework:))
;) 11:53
yeah we need this
At the end of the day, its still going to run Windows!!!!! Windows.... The absolute worst software known to man!!!!!!
you made it impossible to buy one!! lol
Yes. Forget my dreams of XPS 15s and ThinkPads... THIS.
I need one
If only I wasn't so damn broke lol. I really hope they take off big time, we need more of these designs. Hopefully they can come up with some hot swappable  cpu/gpu in the future.
"Where's the type-A port Dell?" And "The Dell's not even f***ing thinner!" Linus You had me laughing. Straight up facts.
you know how other laptop let you physically upgrade the wireless chip, how many times have you not been able to boot after cause the chip you used is not white listed in the things BIOS
You know what... I would order one if the site would stop crashing once I get to the order page since It's the perfect device to replace my old HP Pavilion that I've had for 7 years now.
nah I will just buy  a newer faster model instead.
the coolest thing I have seen from 2019
look promising; waiting for amd board
I want one
Definitely the laptop I've been waiting for!!!! Awesome video Linus and crew!!
When a video gets on the trending page and crashes their website lol
Right to repair. Right to maintain. Right to upgrade.
their website doesn't work
This is so unbelievably cool..... I have wanted EVERYTHING to be like this for years now.... I dont need a laptop right now, but when I do, I'm going strait to these guys.
This laptop legit made me shed a nerd tear, i just wish this thing could go mainstream so we keep support alive.   Plus i want AMD chips in this :(
As someone who has needed to repair laptops as part of my job, I need one of these immediately! Or at least when my current laptop dies, it still has a lot of life left in it.
I NEED TWO RN
Damn, even the camera was amazing!
View is 800K and Like is 80K.😯  And I hope it is because of the Right To Repair awareness.
Neat.  too bad the 'configure now' buttons on their web page don't actually work.
I'd buy it in the future when there's decent ARM support for Windows Other than that, I'm looking forward to a touchscreen and probably OLED
Went to buy one and their site isn't even working.
I might have to get one of these.
I'm very impressed by this laptop,  however, it seems that this could really only work as a good work or school pc.  I hope that they come out with a gaming model with all the customization,  modularity,  and repairablility that this product has.
Just amazing.
This computer is FUCKING INCREDIBLE!!
I love the concept and I hope upgradable laptops are a viable alternative for sealed units, but it will only see success if it appeals to the masses and the enterprise.   To that end, it should have exceptional after-sales service for folks who rather take the computer to the manufacturer than tinker with it themselves, especially when the unit is under warranty.  Also, the company making this should iterate and release new product upgrades at a set schedule and provide long term out of warranty (even if paid) support for the old hardware so that the general consumer can build trust.  Personally, this laptop is not for me, since I use Mac for its software, but for anyone not committed to Apple ecosystem, this looks like an exceptional choice.
SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO where the benchmarking and stress testing???????????????????????????????????????????????
12:00 killed me
Been trying to get this since PCMCIA II, the problem has always been multiple companies trying to hash out a form factor.  So by making their own form factor instead of trying to negotiate a standard they actually get it off the ground.
those are some expensive usb C to A dongles.
Its further Adieu not ado
Thanks Framework. I've found my next laptop.
They can make one that's slightly thicker on the screen's end so it can fit desktop cpus
Looks like we hugged their site to death. Damn though, this thing looks like EXACTLY what I've been wanting for like 10 years. As soon as it's available to me in the UK I'm grabbing one, and likely recommending it to anyone who'll listen
I'm sure everyone is happy as I am to see that webcam quality. I think it's time we transitioned from shitty 720p webcams or no webcams at all (Looking at you ASUS) to having proper 1080p ones.
Once they get AMD onboard, with some sort of replaceable GPU/APU board, and configurable for around $650 USD with Linux drivers for the entire system, then I'll be looking into buying one of these bad boys. Till then I'll stick with used Lenovo Thinkpads.
I like what Linus said. "The philosophical difference between engineering things to make them harder for the end user because you don't trust them, and documenting things to educate the user so you know you can trust them.
what an endorsement
Magnets! Not glues, not plastic tabs, magnets!
I've been specifically looking for a new laptop that I don't have to completely junk if some components break (because I've been trying to keep a dying laptop alive since 2013 and it's a hassle) and tbh this might just do the trick depending on specs.
Was looking for a laptop, might grab one of these. I couldn't find one with medium specs but 1 Tb ssd. They all had 128gb or 256. Which programs like visual studio can easily take up 30 - 50gb. Getting a laptop so I can put in my own 1tb ssd and easily replace a faulty fan. This honestly sounds like such a win to me. And having the option to run a motherboard OUTDIDE the laptop can end up so useful for cncs and stuff where I don't need pins just the usb to run it.   Jaw dropped and majorly impressed. I hope they keep this momentum and keep it all together correctly.
Framework making products like THEY are the consumers!
i was waiting for this review
If only their website worked
imagine framework make the 16" version of this laptop, with 6 to 8 expansion usb c slot, with ethernet included, adding dedicated gpu, if possible also add some kind off upgradeable GPU with mxm slot, this is THE GAMING OR WORKSTATION that will change everything in the future... THANKS AND GREAT JOB FRAMEWORK!
@ louis rossman 🥵🥵🥵🥵
imagine still wearing masks lol.
I'm sorry, but the 'modular I/O' is a bit dumb. It's a puck that converts a type C port to whichever I/O port you want, nothing groundbreaking, all it does is internalize a single port dongle. At that point, I would rather use a dongle, as most of my dongles are either small adapters or multi-port adapters, rather than carrying around a bunch of pucks that I would have to switch out if I wanted a different I/O configuration. It honestly doesn't make sense to have four modular ports, when you could just have four type C ports with a dongle. If you really want or need a broader port selection, then buy a product that comes with that port selection, or just use dongles like a normal person. It's a design choice that only takes up space and increases costs of the product. Honestly, each one of those modular pucks could house at least two ports, except a full size HDMI or DP port, but they could just use mini/micro variants instead, but at that point just use a type C port that has mode switching for eDP. If the spec is USB 4, hubs will become more available and dongles will become even more useful, so again what's the point of internalizing a bulky dongle, when at this point it'll just become a limiting factor for I/O expandability. The only interesting concept here is the storage, but again why not just use typical external drives instead, or if you really need that extra storage why not just upgrade the internal storage so that you also have better performance. It's the classic boardroom idea that doesn't make sense in reality. "let's do this and this," but at what cost? Just throw all type C ports on the device, people can use dongles and hubs like a typical person and not bitch about it. Honestly, if you do bitch about dongles and hubs, you need to get over yourself, and maybe pull your head out of your ass before you suffocate.
If they make a modular gaming laptop, they’re going to take over the entire gaming laptop market…
I don’t need a laptop upgrade, except now I want a laptop upgrade
18:23 - "You say cue-pon?!?!  It's cou-pon!!  It's not q-u-e-u-e-p-o-n.  It's coupon."
Imagine if you could libreboot this
Apple's Kryptonite PagMan
Take that oems!
This is so sick
Reminds me of modular phones
You broke it, Linus. https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-edition "We're sorry, but something went wrong"
1:58  Linus's phone : Why are you showing to the crowd, you are talking about upgrading? huh then upgrade my broken back panel to a new different colored one!!                                                                                                  Linus: I am just gonna throw you away in 6 months or so!
No AMD  apu options?
Not in the market for a laptop right now, but if they're still around in a few years I might take a look at them.  If they expand into higher-end systems it might be nice to see a laptop with a desktop socketed CPU and upgradeable discrete graphics (the later would probably be harder to pull off, but still). Granted, it would be a much larger system, but there's still a market for laptops bigger than your typical thin-and-lights/ultrabooks.
_invest_
I remember when electronic products came with their own PCB diagrams so you could make repairs on your own...
I mean that’s what I don’t understand about right to repair movement. They keep saying it’s about having a option not about forcing people, but then why confront companies for being anti right to repair? If the movement demands change to companies that doesn’t support repairability in their view, how is that not forcing people to repair things by their hands?
Just wish it had more external expansion slots.  That isn't a lot of USB or video ports.
This laptop almost made me cry from happiness. I am looking forward to more content on this product from my other tech channels.
This is super cool to see, literally the only thing the could to better is allow you to select the installed os from the site so they are also supporting open source software.
I don’t know if this has been said or not I can see the computer actually going through a stem class to were kids will actually build their own PC
The masks, they do nothing!
I am a backend developer and have already applied to work for them. Don't even care about how much they would pay me. Just want to play my part to see them succeed.
Want
its so beautiful that I felt like crying
There website needs to work a lot better than it does, I am very excited and want to own this already! Website keeps bugging after clicking any clickable option they have...lol
Ideas for them: recessed usb’s for wireless dongles and sim slot module for 5G modems…
They need to make a modular gpu upgrade.
Hey, Linus is the GPU upgradable, and aside from intel processors and GPU,  can we use AMD and Nvidia graphic cards.
I've noticed they didn't mention something: Graphics card. I guess it doesn't run crysis then uh?.   Edit: Nevermind, Iris XE... so yeah, no Crysis here; guess I'll wait until they allow for a Ryzen APU with RDNA2 at least.
their site is down when trying o buy one
11:54
I just bought a laptop, but this is going to be my next laptop when it becomes cheaper. ~$400 over budget for me rn.
sooo expensive tho
My only thing that I'd want from this is more IO slots.
Perfec! I really like this laptop.
7:33 - Says the man manhandling the laptop created by some ex-Lenovo engineers without Trackpoint. lol.
I crank the video quality to the MAX to see liunixs's arm hair
this might be the most positive review I've ever heard Linus give
not in the market for a new laptop at the moment, but this, this just gets my money in the future!
This thing looks great! I like the display resolution they chose.
I have a laptop with an upgradable CPU slot!
how do i do a preorder on the web? it seems like the web for framework has issues
But can it game tho?
the 500 dislikes were by people who were sleepy and thought they were pressing the like button
when i was a child this was my dream now 8 years later it's come real, I'm going to support this company, i can't wait for the next version with dedicated graphics...
I love the modular concept.. if this company gains traction and sells a lot of units it should force other company's like Apple and Lonovo to re-think there product lines and perhaps the Modular IO concept will become the de facto industry standard in a few years..
Now make a gaming version, I want a 3090 slapped in there for shiggles.
I went to their website, but when you click to build, it doesn't actually load any ability to build or buy
This is the first laptop in over a decade that really made me feel like it was futuristic
There thunderbolt?
15:40 there are magnetic usb type c thingy
Most laptops have upgradable ram, ssds and battery, the 'you can put your ports anywhere' doesn't justify this laptop at all
If they had options for gaming processors and graphics cards I would definitely buy this, so freaking cool!
Pretty sure Linus broke their website. And this is 9 HOURS AFTER UPLOAF!
This is the first product I'm sold on, hope I'm able to get my hands on one this year
Now this is something i can use the "Take my Money" meme. I want to order!
definitely not gorgeous but cool regardless
If they made options for more budget friendly buyers, more people would be interested. $700+ starting point sounds quite steep, most of it being mobo and CPU (?)  Like that one meme: "we will watch your career with great interest"
For the first time in 10 years I want a laptop
The webcam on the laptop is clearer then the one that you use for your show. (For me) ;)
This  would  be my next laptop if they have amd cpu
IF They manage to find a way to make the CPU/GPU upgradable I would be sold.  Yes, I know they have gone soldered :) fix it.  There is no performance need for soldered CPU/GPU parts in these.
The immense clipper collaterally dam because spike relevantly rot within a raspy propane. humdrum, evanescent taste
I am only half-way through the video, but I want to tip my hat to the people at Framework. They bring all the goodness from Apple, Lenovo, and such, and infuse the spirit of DIY (along with what the users have always wanted) without the big corporate burden, into a surprisingly refined product (which I think holds great promise). I just can't wait until the end of the video to say "You people are amazing!"
7:32 ME TOO! btw, another toughbook but this time slim and sleeek
I think this is less of an "upgradeable" laptop and more of a "modular/repairable" one. Not saying it's a bad thing, just that there's not much you can actually upgrade.
Yayay trending!!!
1:51 and pause
i hope this gets released in Australia!
Linus: hates dongles Also Linus: loves these dongle cartridges 🤔
Is it possible to get an expansion port cd drive?
The expansion slots are a genius move. It's just like a Nintendo DS or 3DS slots for this laptop.
came to the comments to see who else said something about linus' busted up phone. ..... anyone? 1:58
why don't micro center open in india???
But does it play Doom
Take my money!!!
I love the idea of this.  They MUST add some better graphics options though. The Iris Xe Graphics is it?
The problem will be eventually Apple will buy the company for a few billion (good for the framework guys) and immediately shut them down...
I just wish they added a trackpoint and also had larger screen options. I'll keep using thinkpads until that day comes
But... CAN YOU UPGRADE THE GPU?!?!?!? HMMMMMMMM?🤔😂
This is amazing
With the death of the Modular phone... I really hope this doesn’t fail.
In a few years when I'm looking for a new laptop if these guys are still around upgrading this thing I'll probably get one
do a white gundam pc please
I like it I really do but isn't this like toughbook 5.0 or whatever it is I understand the tough book is in a different class but they basically offer for the most part the same modularity I know they still offer CD-ROM LOL but I can get behind this
MAn THIISI ISSS CLLLEAAAAn. They should make one for power users that has massive chonky battery, and a trackpoint on top of the already large surface area of trackpad. oh, and maybe they can source an ultrawide panel someday. I never seent anyone other than acer doned dat for a laptop, so it wood be kinda cool even just to see a normal non gaming panel, as long as it was 21:9 on a laptop. Wood be mega interesting.
Alex should make the magnetic charging connector
Off Camera bois were on fire in this video. !!!!!
Their website doesn't work
I think im sold
i mean there are USB mag safe adapters.
just another comercial ... meh!
Their website is  a mess.  Wanted to spec one out but couldn't.  That's the problem with startups like this.  They get the influencers hyped  but then fall flat on their faces when it comes to consumers trying to get one.
My brother really want to switch his laptop but he's a graphic designer. Is Iris Xe Graphics have any issue to run adobe illustrator?
Great. So now I just buy a Intel ***** where? I can't wait to do the two things I already did, replace the SSD and RAM. This didn't change anything. Looks nice though. Good for it.
i think i have the worst pc in the world my graphics card is a gt 260
You use a wired mouse because you are an elite gamer, Linus. Oh wait, your gaming sucks... Yeah, why do you use a wired mouse?!? /jk :D
April fools rename your channel to Linus "Tick tok tips"
You know what I actually don't mind paying more for this laptop. So Dell, HP, etc, you can all suck it
If they sold these here in Australia with local pricing, I'd buy one today.   No joke, this is 100% what I want from a laptop.
Framework: You had my curiosity, now you have my attention.
Just went to the website to price it out, the website seems broken to me. Always land at "Oops, something went wrong". Canadian customer here.
#9hoursquad
Monke
Now that's a dream company.
Please upgrade your windows 🤭
Does this have thunderbolt capability? Just curious if I can plug it into an external gpu
is it your daily driver???
actual freaking innovation.. damn.
i want it with all see-through plastic panels like a 90s gameboy lol
More of this, please!
Was hoping linus connect an egpu and run some games on it, oh well
i want the black one...
Modular Electronics and Modular appliances are the future since they promote sustainable ecology.
11:30 mating sounds lmao
I want one so bad and willing to pay but I can’t get the website to work on phone or pc
I gave a full watchtime, a like, and now a comment. It is already 29 on trending so I hope that goes up
Imagine making a Laptop like the Apple commercials say.
I want one just to build it ADULT LEGO KIT 😁
I could not come up with a series of words capable of conveying how much I love this, so I'm just leaving this comment instead.
wow ... I was thinking of a new laptop soon ... and I think I've found who I'm going with ... this is the sort of thing I want in my life, and the kind of business I want to support. Very cool.
that thing is pretty dope. might have to look into preorder myself.
SHUT UP AND TAKE... MY... MONEY...
This will be my next laptop. Handy down: I love it! (Especially if there is a 15" version)
All we have to hope for now is that Apple gets the word. Edit: This video got #31 on Trending!
I hope these things fly off the virtual shelves
GAAAH shipping isn't available in Australia yet 😭
Cool idea, but I doubt the market for these are that big
REPLACE YOUR PHONE GLASS !
The site doesn’t work
use it up  wear it out  make it do  or do without.. || changing mind ||
Man this is so amazing
Louis Rossmann just had a stroke watching this
can't wait till there available in australia
After the ThinkPad stopped being the ThinkPad, because they stopped making it easily repairable, I think this would be the best successor it has to date in spirit.
Only Intel? Hard pass.
I really love this!! I wish they could've done modular upgrade for the motherboard/cpu combo as well. That way, when I know everything else works but I need an upgrade, I can do it through them. Also, how I wish I can buy this right now in Indonesia...
Very rarely does Linus get this excited. That speaks volume when he really loves something because he is one picky tech guy.
Shut up and take my money
If we still had removable wifi cards then we could all have wifi 6e for like $40
its the stratocaster for laptop
If that G.Skill case had mesh side-panels and no RGB, I'd buy it.
damn, my laptop currently can't run the latest version of minecraft due to an open GL driver problem-
Dell is going to buy this company just to kill it.
You crashed their site lol, it is practically unusable. Linus'd
I love this, but I want a bigger one with a numpad and full-size arrow keys
11:56 LMAO
Well, their website is broken!
Sounded disingenuous. Basically a 20 min commercial fro a product that is meh at best.
If they can manage to make an upgradeable motherboard I can see myself upgrading the motherboard module more often than I'm currently changing my laptop. A good screen cost nearly half the laptop price. Keeping the memory and ssd while only splurging on motherboard and cpu.
Interesting, but not very powerful laptops.  I’ll keep an eye on them and see how they do, but lets face it.  Companies come and go, especially when it comes to hardware.  You can only upgrade so much before it requires a complete replacement of everything.  Glue is used to keep things light and tight.  Modular adds a lot of weight and ugly look.  Sticking with my MacBook Pro for now.
This is amazing , going to keep my eyes on them when i need a new laptop.
Make this a touch 2 in 1 Laptop and I’ll come running with my wallet!!!
its missing the thunderbolts ports, if that is available then it will be great to use external gpu on this laptop
This is so freaking cool!!!!!
The excuse is not that it cant be done but that it would bring in less profit if you upgrade the parts rather than the whole xP
Soy el único que vio la NOM mexicana 😳 esta compañía va en serio por el mercado latinoamericano wow 😯
Show the hinges
VERY sexy concept and business model!
I went to their shop to check out configurations and it appears us LTT fans have crashed the site. Whoops.. Guess that's a great sign, though!
Way to go, Linus…you dropped this one and broke the website.  Can’t you hold on to anything nice?
Now this is definitely a *HUGE* step in the right direction!
So much love from Frame.Work Think I'm gonna send love in return...
i remember when they tried to do a phone like this it was too expensive to get the parts made to swap in an out
If someone wanted a magnetic charger why not use the Volta cable since the charger is modular?
As a nobody, I support this movement
Accessibility and documentation are sweet, but these hot-swap USB-C module things seem a bit over engineered. One USB-A and USB-C on each side would be plenty flexible and leave should leave enough room on the inside for a full size M.2 slot for Storage/5g.
dam site is crashing
This is a really exciting laptop! Modular, upgradeable, and repairable. This is amaaazing
Best LTT video this year... I am sold!
I need help Linus or anybody out there with pc experience I have a problem with my screen flickering and I can't access anything ok launch in safe mode reset pc nope black screen ok then troubleshoot from sign in unable to repair and I can't update my drivers to fix my flickering screen what do I do I haven't tried anything else and I'm thinking about buying a windows 10 USB drive and downloading it
You had me at anime laptop
I don't need a laptop right now but when I am in the market for buying a laptop next time around, I'm checking out their crap. Also Linus didn't mention this but I believe their bios is open.  Edit: I missed the part where Linus does talk about the bios. Friggin cool
1000$ for i5 with integrated GPU,8GB ram and 256GB SSD... no thx
9:23 I learned that the hard way
Amazing company, I hope this will develop further. I am personally switched to macos from windows, but if I would go for windows I would definitely consider this one. Thanks for covering this laptop!
（cough) Dell🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If they come out with a 2 in 1, I'm in
oooohhhhh ok this is my next laptop when my dell with a socked cpu that I bought in 2015 is no longer worth upgrading  in 3 years.
Linus watches anime???
This but 15” with a discreet GPU and I would buy instantly
I could see some awesome 3rd party accessories coming later.
More junk
Project ARA? Phone Blocks? no? nobody ? ;n;
Linusss you broke their website
Linus....you forgot to talk about the elephant in the room.....the graphics processor. That's where the performance is at.....they say Iris XE. What is your take on Iris?
you crashed the site hahahahaha i was going to order one right away cause i love things like this and it just refuses to let me configure lmfao guess i'll try again tomorrow
that laptop🦴🦴 thinnnnnnnnnnnnnnn my laptop thicccccccccccc🐘🐘
That is awesome. This is my next laptop!
Dude framework is amazing for all of this! My god once I get money I'ma get this😅
I can see myself buying one to be honest. When my surface pro 4 finally dies I'll invest in one of these and make a pen touch monitor for it too
8:18 thats another drop tip for ya , GOT EM' 😁😁😂😂😂
Sorry guys, Apple or some other company will buy them or just switch RnD to run them out of business if this becomes successful. That is how apple does business. They begin by first offering the staff who work at those companies higher salaries and steal their talent, when the company is on its knees they buy them up for their IP. If they don't comply, they copy their tech using their own staff and run them out. That is how apple competes and why startups don't last long in silicon valley. A lot of people want those high salaries without considering the long term costs of giving up their IP and dreams. Apple has been using this strategy for almost a decade and it works.
I didn't hear any mention of a upgradable gpu???  That's the main thing I would want to swap out
This laptop have better camera then my phone
This, with ARM, will absolutely ROCK in terms of battery live! Oh my god, i love this xD
Can I please be an investor of this company?!
Now i want to see framework do a gaming laptop with upgradeable MXM graphics ❤❤❤
This is so cool! Now if they make swappable GPUs for these the other guys better watch out.
and this is why companies talk to Lmg, because hes fairly honest (if sometimes brutal) and unless its a real big company lmgs word can really help or hurt
Wow. That laptop is better than my computer
Do monkeys press NEXT?
only thing i'm sad about it.... is as a gamer.... video card ;c
If this company can get the replaceable graphics cards in stock and parts for future.  Id totally go to them and just inveset into a machine that I can slowly keep changing into the future.
Now they just need to make a laptop with good graphics options that are modular and I would be all over that!
For us old people, you could resurrect your old GameBoy game cartridge shellcase for these modules. Imagine whippin that out at the next tech convention. All the girls would be like, not noticing you just like always, but the guys would be like "WOAH"!  EDIT: I will say I wish this was available when I was looking for a laptop for my wife. She is constantly needing more storage and shit and uses her laptop daily, for hours. She's hard on her laptops.
FINALY A UPGRADEABLE LAPTOP LIKE PC
How does it perform with Gaming or Productivity (photoshop/music production)?
That's pretty damn awesome. I don't need a laptop right now but if I did I'd probably consider this one.
I don’t even care for laptops and I’m excited about this. This is a step in the right direction for the future of PCs
I'm happy that my stupid twitter comment had some impact on you making a video about this amazing laptop.   Framework should've made a 10% discount with you guys but still, I guess they'll get a few hits on their website.
This is actually sick. I will be purchasing when the website is uncrashed lol
reminded of Wells American, they had a modular easy upgrade desktop  late 80s early 90s
11:53 What the hell was that?
Like many other great companies, and brilliant minds - Koenigsegg, Paypal, Tesla - it just takes a few dedicated people with some passion to go a long way.
This seem like a good company and i hope they succeed. if my laptop gets KIA'd, ill definitley consider this. with that said, ive seen so many "modular" designs in tech fail over the past decade (after banking on making back their money on components), it makes me a bit nervous. RIP LG G5, essential, moto mods, project ara, area-51m, and so many more
This is a laptop that deserves to be bought massively. I hate current laptop computers and never being able to upgrade it. It makes me never buy one despite how much use I could get out of one. Please buy this laptop guys.
Hopefully this is the future of these devices.  Being able to just swap out a motherboard for a new gen CPU/chipset upgrade is a game changer. No more throwing away your fantastic laptop display because a capacitor somewhere shit itself. You just swap out the M/borad old for new (or whichever modular part needs changing).
Very interested in something like this. I would be interested to see what their framework store would look like once orders go live, but either way, love the enthusiasm and thoughtfulness of the team at framework. Thank you for taking a look at this for us!
Linus: 100 degrees is technically ok my laptop: phew- Wait that's set to celsius.
This is a very interesting concept and I may have ordered one of these if there was an AMD option with dGPU. Maybe in the future. I just won't give Intel money and I need a dGPU.
It's amazing but it's sad that it'll probably not even get a chance to become popular :(
If they offer ARM and/or RISCV, I'll be on board. I would like to have an ARM or RISCV Linux laptop with battery life to match.
Linus likes anime did I hear that correctly??
I WANT!!!!! The website wont let me buy it though. I'll keep checking back though.
I need this.
This will be cool if they start offering Ryzen options
aww Framework website is down for the DIY laptop version.  I guess they got swamped with orders! Good for them, I hope this business model catches on.
This is amazing. A work of art. I can totally trust them being engineers from Lenovo and apple and actually wanting to do better and actually give customers a product worth the money. I want one.
Now were just need slotted cpus/gpus & fan slots.
Well this trash no upgradable GPU or CPU, the major parts that fail and drastically improve device lifetime.
We need more laptop like this.. wish they also have AMD version.. ☺️
I really like this laptop, but sadly they still not open for order to sent it into indonesia
"Can we appreciate that the only non removable IO on this thing is a headphone jack??" FUCKING SOLD! A Laptop I would ACTUALLY BUY!!!!!
This is cool
yeah bigman upgradeble huh? but  can you change the gpu?
I love when they flip the camera around to the idiot sitting by himself with a mask on. Cringe
Never seen Linus fall in love with a laptop like he has with this!!!
waiting for them to figure out how to made mobile CPU and GPU swappable... not sure if it's doable since CPU and GPU upgrade also means the cooling system need to be upgradable to match...
The first laptop ever to get linus this exicted He even said its just perfect 👌  Im buying one for gaming on pop os
Great video, WHY am i smiling and so happy about this computer.  :)
Apple is sweating
Links broken homes
We need this in Indonesia

I usually reserve my liked videos for music but this is an exception.
This is a right to repair activist's wet dream
Absolutely love it and everything it is trying to achieve but I honestly wonder if the average laptop buyer actually wants to go tinking around in their device?
Is there a ChromeOS/ChromiumOS certified version?
Unfortunate that they don't have anything for video cards in their laptops, I am looking for a new laptop and I would love to support them, but I would rather have something I can use for games too, no point spending 1k$ if I'll only use it for email and YouTube.
How many of us have built our own desktop? Lots of people who watch Linus, and we also might like to tinker with our laptop.
I think I am going to buy it. Not only because of the whole idea and concept which deserves to become a next big hit, but it is a product I could actually see myself using.
This laptop is fkkin amazing !! I always hated laptops for this exact issue, now me, a full grown man with a gaming dual screen pc, consider having one for my family travel :o
16:18 don't laptop's do this automatically when they're plugged in?
SIGN ME UP FOR THE GAMER EDITION. I would love these people if they could possibly integrate a GPU into the system. It would be insane.
I AM GOING TO BUY THIS NO JOKE
It looks amazing, I hope they add an AMD option soon
A happy Linus spotted in his optimal habitat.
I was going to get is but then I noticed I’m poor
Linus, I don't know who to ask, but I need some suggestions. Please
C'mon Linus, don't get too crazy.  I love you guys but let's not pretend that the fact that an ultrabook with a low-power cpu and integrated graphics being thinner than a computer that needs to cool a 3050ti and an eight core i9 is too impressive.
This with the fairphone is the ultimate combo.
I bought a sponsor speaks volumes about your business acromen sir.
Looks like I have a new favourite laptop.
linus no! what happened to your note 9!
I think that's the best review Linus has ever given a product. It's got me interested.  I've been wanting a new laptop. But, I'm picky. I don't care what the cost is. It's certain features I want and it's so hard to find all of them on one laptop. Spending hours searching laptops trying to zoom in on them and see if you're really going to like it or not. This solves all of that. You can almost order this blindfolded since you know you're almost never screwed if you don't like something about it when it arrives.
I've been following these guys for a while and love what I'm seeing. If they can come out with a convertible laptop model, I'll be all over it.
We need to support in this guys!
This kind of gives me 90s IBM laptop vibes where you can pretty much slot in anything you want in these bays from floppy drives to CD-ROM drives to extra batteries. It's just a shame that there can't be a standard for it because when these devices come out, they last for a couple years, and then fade to the wayside.
As a ThinkPad guy, all I want from this laptop now is a good quality stick mouse in the keyboard. If that becomes available, this is the laptop I want.
Are you ever gonna do an msrp gpu give away because I have been waiting months and can't get one
11:57 that is genuinely terrifying
I don't need this right now, but I want it so much! I really want this company to succeed so badly, I might just buy one anyway. External GPU support in a future module would make this my only computer, and a true replacement for my Zephyrus.
14:17 lmao
WHO TF is disliking this? Apple employees?
interesting laptop, would love to order, but the website is crashing harder than an original Nintendo
you guys crash their site!!!
A gaming laptop upgradeable like this... Damn
Whenever I try to go to the website, it always resets or crashes or something else. Guess there must be a lot of traffic right now.
14:17 My new favorite Linus throwing shade moment.
#righttorepair
I hope they don't end up like OnePlus and get so big they decide to just copy what the other brands are doing and stop being themselves
I got so nervous while Linus was flipping the laptop around...
17:30 "where else am I gonna go" The best part about saying that here is that it's not even because they're locking you in, it's because no one else is providing this kind of service.
since no dedicated graphics an AMD APU version may give better graphics performance
You know there are already USB-C magnetic connectors that support USB PD up to 100w? You can find them on Amazon among other places. The connectors are available for as low as $12 U.S.
I know this sounds silly but can I still use a USB dongle or hub if I lost a swappable usb c dongle that comes with the laptop ? Will there be a 17 inch model option from framework in the near future ?
Didn’t G.Skill buy the Segway to the sponsorship part of the video 🧐😂 0:41
Love, love, love this. I may very well look to buy one of these next.
POV: you used a QR reader from an app or Google lens built into the camera and scanned the QR codes.
Unless cpu and gpu are upgradable its a waste
i really hope they make one with better gpu or a gpu case to plug into it
Man, if they offered real graphics cards this would be my next computer. Must have a 3060 at a min guys, come on! Also talk with Logitech and get the unifying receiver hardware cooked into the motherboard, I hate having to chew up a USB-A port on my laptop so I can use my mouse when there is plenty of space inside the case for it.
Economically it doesn't make sense the company just won't survive with this type of in terms of price cost
This is literally the only laptop in the past 15 years that has interested me. I'm typically not a big fan of laptops, because most of them (along with most other electronics) are designed to be tossed in the bin when they reach a certain age.  If I had the money right now i'd order one for sure.  And I hate the entire 'disposable electronics' culture.  Most of them are made intentionally disposable by 'software' that is told to slow it down.  Or by companies saying "you can't do anything but what WE want you to do with it".     Like when Apple starts pulling apps from the app store if your system no longer meets their 'requirements'.   Let us use the old version of the app instead of removing it entirely.    Like when Apple pulled Garage band from all systems that were under a certain OS version.   I am far less likely to buy a product from a company when they basically hold my apps hostage like that.  I won't pay ANOTHER $700-1500 for a product that I already bought specifically FOR a piece of software, that they then took away from me on a whim.
Google Ara Phonebloks failed miserably, this will meet the same fate.
My Acer allows me to run the battery at 80% max charge. I like that.  I'd like to see more plugs. Why is there only one USB per module?
He didn't say anything about the GPU. I'm assuming it's made to the motherboard just like the CPU and that replacing one requires all three to be replaced. That's basically the price of a new laptop. The modulatory and repairability would be great to have but it seems to me that it would be just as costly in the long run.
Holy shit this is amazing. If I needed a laptop this is what I'd go for. For now, a smartphone still does it all for me.
i think linus broke the site
It would be interesting if they did a gaming oriented one...
Love it. See ya in 2 years
Customizable? Is that legal in this day and age?
lol angy linus moment funni 😂😂😂 14:16
I will be following these guys and might order one when I eventually need to replace my laptop because 1 thing broke.
meh!
RTR friendly laptop, that also doesn’t require a full user manual to repair and replace, nice
I’m so glad this product exists. I know what laptop I’m buying when next I need one.
we need twitch emotes on yt
THAT WAS SWITCH REALIZATION EDIT WAS DEFINITLY MADISON
I cannot wait till this thing goes live, I'm copping it day 1
When linus says de.. i laughed and yes even though the laptop might not have bigger screens or upgradeable storage or wireless  i might say this is the way to get more kids to make technology i like it ( the bigger companies that see linus videos: We gotta copy this )
Hopefully they find a niche in the market that gets big manufacturers uncomfortable.
i could say i'm falling in love with this laptop!!
If I missed it im sorry laptop weight is always a big factor in the purchases for a lot of people
Its a product of ethics. Comment so youtube knows I'm engage with this kind of contents
Finally the laptop I have always wanted!! I have dreamed of a laptop that can be upgraded changed and have parts replaced for a long time now. I may be buying this one!
Still look like 2010 looking laptop.  Edit: love the concept tho.
if they ever make a 15inch with a touchscreen and dedicated graphics im buying one
Ive been looking for something like this for a while
@jerryrigeverything
Awesome product
I don't even use the laptop I already have but I am 100% buying one of these when they become available in Europe. If these guys can get their enterprise support down they will make an absolute killing too. Being able to swap out the parts users break without having to replace whole devices would be an absolute godsend. The number of laptops we recycle due to broken charging ports or damaged screens because its simply not cost effective for us to fix them is beyond depressing.
1:37 heart attack
mmMMM LUV IT
I can imagine a future where people have these and they carrying around the expansion cards like gameboy cartridges or sd cards
I NEED TO SAVE UP FOR ONE OF THOSES THAT IS AWESOME
Happiness and that beard suits you like a globe, my dear Linus. God loves you!
Gimme gimme gimme, let me build my own laptop!
This is quite awesome, but I want a gamer version. I don't mind it being thicker.
Is it possible for laptop to have kind of PCIe slot outside so you can actually use full speed GPU outside? Or it's just impossible because of technical reason?
This laptop and videos itself looks like explaining what agent 007 use on his missions
god I hope they don't go under. Its always companies like this that fail for stupid reasons.
This company's best shot is to make an offer to a very large company that looks forward to cutting down IT related expenses by keeping existing equipment functioning as long as possible.
This is interesting and I did go try to configure one for the hell of it (site still crashing though), but it's not really my cup of tea since, for the most part, I only buy higher-end gaming laptops. If they ever come out with a line of gaming laptops (even if bulkier and heavier like my current one is) AND the graphics card is upgradable with Nvidia's latest and greatest, then I can easily see this as my next gaming laptop since I could probably get away with just replacing the graphics card every couple of years instead of having to replace the whole thing. I could do a major investment on the first purchase and then save money by just upgrading. All that being said, I am still interested in pricing a few out for some clients of mine who need business laptops.
It's so rare to see Linus is smiling so bright like that. Love it :)
"Some anime show that I love"  Quite the Linus statement
Oh man, if I ever need a laptop or just have a spare grand soon, I have to have this. It addresses every reason I've avoided laptops. I would like upgradable graphics cards, but maybe that kind of power is best left in a desktop, so this could focus on being portable and flexible.
"The Dell's not even fucking thinner" I died lmao
This is every poor gamer's wet dream.
will we see him drop that laptop ???
i hope this company stays on track and becomes successful enuf to end apple. it's a long shot but i hope they do.
For normal consumer this is awsome (large part of consumers today)... upgradable and fixble is what most ppl need!! if they market right they will make it big!!   and soon they will be able to acomodate the gamers taste!!
Take my money now!
ah dam the site cant handle the load!
If it has TrackPoint, I think I will buy one. I really like track point, it's more convenient then touchpad.
Damn.. when is this coming to Brazil?
Hope they get big enough until it's available in my country!
#System76 Please take note!!!!! 🎶
If apple introduced a modular laptop where the majority of upgrades had to be from proprietary parts, Linus would say ‘not good enough, Apple’. The fact you can’t upgrade the CPU makes this a bad buy. Because in a world where SSDs are commonplace, the CPU will be the bottleneck as times change. We’re all still running fine on 16GBs of ram and have been for a decade. But try running a CPU from a decade ago and you’ll feel it.   I love that the battery is user serviceable. And Apple et al could and should do better there - it’s a ‘consumable’.  But I feel like the fever dream of a modular laptop is just that. And this company will sadly fail because the market for people who want a modular laptop is niche.
Once this has a touch screen option, I'm in. This is what I've wanted.
Previously working in break fix for a large financial institution having these laptops today would be a godsend. I'm old enough that the machines from HP and Dell we were dealing with were as accessible as these (even with socketable chips) but I've often thought it'd be a nightmare working there now given you'd be a glorified box swapper as you couldn't really repair anything.  Hopefully enterprise gets in on this, it would be a massive boon to the second line support engineers like I was, a massive saving on their bottom line having to replace entire units and a great revenue stream that will ensure Frameworks future.
Apple spend billions of dollars, to make sure it user cannot upgrade its laptop so if you need more ram or faster processor or io, simple toss it and buy new one, or buy "Dongle" also put slogan safe the planet for added benefit.
This is definitely my next laptop
can't even order one!
Eh. I'll take a steam deck instead. Easy pass for me on this.
Definitely my next laptop, when my existing one needs replacement. Good job Framework!
Trackpoint and I'm yours. ♥️
Magnetic charging?  Volta, maybe?
This is fantastic. I want to order from them just to support them
If this project become true and be able to buy anywhere, and if i want a new laptop at that moment, this is it.
Finally a laptop manufacturer asking "Why?" Cannot wait to see how this evolves.  I cannot wait until we have hot swappable modules for mini water cooling loops, fans and dGPUs in this thing.  Upgradable, simple to open and a decent webcam, epic!.  If the motherboard can be swapped out we'll finally have a reusable laptop chassis, display, battery and even the swappable IO cards that can live on for many years and still be performant.
I love this
This laptop looks absolutely wonderful, but i can tell you where the drawback went: This is not configurable with a dedicated gpu. you are limited to Iris Xe, the onboard intel gpu, which is arguably better than nothing, but still doesnt beat the Dell XPS 15's 1650.  Otherwise, loads of really amazing ideas. I'd like to see one with configurable graphics for those of us that need portable machines capable of handling CAD and such.
If they make a discrete graphics card module I will consider it.
This is a company I will support.
Now that's a genuinely innovative solution for using boring standard hardware we all still actually use. Really hope this idea takes off and becomes standard. Was never a fan of the dangly dongle life that Apple "encouraged" everyone else into.
They got a strong framework *the look*
Welp once again Linus drops something 😑
Is it liquid-metal friendly?
And as far as i know they agreed to publish the Mainboard-Schematics to repair shops
This is nice. I would buy one. I hope this succeed. Please sell a lot of this to change the industry.
I like that it uses two heatpipes instead of just one which many laptops do still use whne there is a low power consumption cpu in it. Just gives it that extra potential for cooling
I've been needing a new laptop, and I think I found it
alright can it run acrh crysis mincraft?
Linus is excited, he went full Dolphin on us!
OMG yes. PC community needs this. Too long has the custom PC been exclusively desktop units or way overpriced laptops that are non-repairable.
honestly, I will be recommending people get this.  I dont feel like it's a compromise to getting a regular computer
super cool
17:25 Activate Bimbows
I still own every laptop I've ever purchased, and they all work. The oldest one is a Dell from 2006. It's running Windows 10 32 bit. I treat my computers well and repair them if anything goes wrong (but have only needed to do that twice).
Framework X Steam Steam Deck APU Midnight Blue finish Steam logo at the back 🤯
The mere ease at which you got the cover off sold me.
This reminds me of the Phoneblocks, aka the modular phone project ARA killed by Google.
I just found my next car which is near perfect the Hyundai Ioniq. Now I find my near-perfect laptop, it just needs a ryzen cpu and AMD gpu. I am excited.
i despise laptops to the point where while working in computer retail i would pass off customers to another sales guy when they said they wanted a laptop... i really want this laptop
Pause at 0:00
This is so cool. It's like the beginning of the ATX for pc
Listen, anybody who ever had to repair their pc is buying this right now. And thanks everyone yall broke the site I can't buy mine.
This is why people loved ThinkPads. Unfortunately even they went to shit.
You can upgrade apple devices also. I do it every year when they release a new version.
14:17 "THE DELL'S NOT EVEN F***ING THINNER!"
solder all the things or glue....    most likely glue all the things
Shut up and take my money!
its called a motherboard
A nice trend for changing ram/battery/ but still very basic. A cheap hub can deal with the problems of ports. I'd like support for new motherboards/processors/graphics cards. Not an easy feat but would be a nice change the industry needs.
I've got a asus zenbook, and 2 years from now I know where I'm gonna get my next laptop.
You have to imagine every other company being like, "Okay, This is the market shift. We have to reproduce this." Planned obsolescence is a thing.
Was anyone else super nervous with the way linus was waving that damn thing about one handed?
This company deserves to be on the levels of Microsoft and Apple. This is awesome!
how did msft and apple trademark the mag safe stuff? with your one sponsor that makes the mag safe  phone chargers???
A good step forward. Still needs an MXM 4.0 gpu though.
Thats amazing!
They should send Linus whatever he orders for free. Their site is crashing from the traffic. Can't wait for this to be available in Australia.
Watching this video gave me a completely different feeling compare to that JOAT case video..
Call dbrand skin those internal parts ;)
When I need a new one next ill go for one of these now!!!!!!!!!! Another great vid guys!
This something big tech needs
This is the future where all manufacturers should go. My friends brings laptop hoping they can make it work but it's harder and harder to fix these days because 1. I'm noob. 2. It's very hard to troubleshoot down to component level, It's a nightmare for me and 3. No schematics easily available in manufacturer website or anywhere else. Extra point 4. I do it for free so can't afford to buy things so I can help them. ☹
yeah the framework website is totally jacked.. that sucks
Linus does is this compatible with usb4 spec? Including pcie 4. I know there might be reason you can't say thunderbolt outright
This is the laptop and companies WE ALL SHOULD SUPPORT!!!! I'm IN!
Modern hardware to upgrade even a simple hard drive really pisses me off, my grandfather has a 3yr old one that I literally have to dissemble into pieces and even remove the keyboard just to get access to anything underneath, ffs companies what the hell!. Yet I have an old 2011 HP laptop where its so simple to access, just pop out the battery and slide a switch to remove the large cover hiding the hard drive, RAM and wifi card. To upgrade the RAM on a lot of modern laptops could take me 30/45mins but this old HP I'm done in 30secs.
Now I'm seeing a modular gaming laptop
Probably most optimistic videos in a year
I kinda want one.
this... makes me very happy
RIP their website. Hugged to death
I prefer to donate extra money to this company rather than letting apple steal my money with overpriced devices, parts, and repairs.
Now it's possible to upgrade from your laptop, lifespan INCREASED!
Unfortunately, the configure part of the website is down. Is big tech  going to allow a product like this to thrive? doubtful. But I plan on buying one if possible.
How do right to repair an Apple Watch I don’t want this movement fucking up design
Dont see an AMD option. Would love to see that
upgradeable only on the ports side, because absolutely everything else is exactly the same as any other standard cheap current laptop, from any non fanaticist brand.
I fuck with this
Just dont drop it.
Brilliant Video
Super cool. Id be interested in a year of use update.  What will wear and flex when its all screwed together?
Ok but where do i put the gpu?
Ooooh it even comes with a screw driver! It's the little things 😊
Finally! I’ve been looking for decades for a laptop that will let me disable the battery when it is plugged in. Or even better, let us stop charging it at 75% or so.
Went to go configure one and probably order it but apparently your video has completely overloaded their site. :( Really excited for this.
A  complete Ship of Theseus scenario going on here....
As far as motherboard upgradeability goes, if they have schematics that repair shops can use and they don't use restricted supply components like Apple's charge controllers then they're a slam dunk because that permits easy board repair.
Yah the cpu isn’t upgradeable because its soldered to the board. But if they continue to use the same form factor of the motherboard you can replace the entire board with the new CPU on it. Which in a desktop if your waiting a reasonable amount of time you need replace the mother board anyways.
I wonder how this would work with something like the Razer Core for external GPU's
To be fair the Alienware Area 51m has an upgradable socketed desktop processor,  upgradable RAM. M.2/wlan etc.
Soulful product, Soulful review
My notifications really just said this came out 1 min ago
2010 called and wants is ugly ass silver laptop back
You didn't BUY the seaway to your sponsor,  you sold it 😀
I saw a video on this a while back, these guys are super cool. I'm excited to see them thrive.
if you see a bar code on that laptop you can change it
I recently disassembled an old Asus laptop and moved it out of the case, I had to tape over 3 freaking sensors for it to even POST in its new enclosure.
See, it wasn't so hard after all...   I guess a lot of work went behind this and congrats to the team. But, it is however possible
My next laptop I will get when I cant fix my laptop
Proof it was possible all along and as you said the big guys just didn't want to. Short term profit over everything I guess. So happy for Framework.
open from bottom but pop out the keyboard from top
This thing is awesome! For what it offers, modularity, openness even if they go out of business its a great laptop. Its price on its website is also very very good. If there customer service is suburb these guys will go places. Try calling Dell its pure hell.
https://youtu.be/yCyi2NgjyHs
Can we get a AMD 5800U version of this laptop?
Color coded screws! Oh god what an AMAZING idea!
I was super excited about this machine... But no thunderbolt, no windows hello face login, and no touch screen are all no goes for me. I'll keep my eye out for future upgrades though!
you see, you dont need a modular laptop when you have a laptop thats so old, it has and hdmi and a display port on the side
These are way to affordable and good. What is the catch?
Don't know a stronger endorsement than Linus buying the product halfway through the review
Ok, this is completely awesome
I had to pre order 2
5 bucks says that some Chinese company is going to copy it and sell the modules for dirt, and making framework go bankrupt.
You could tell, Linus loved every bit of it! Those are genuine expressions which even paid actors cannot deliver!
I’m an electrical engineer, not only will I buy one to support these guys but ima try applying to join them lol
It'd be awesome if you did invest in this company! They need to do well. That'd be awesome. Also, people should stop buying Apple products. :)
MICRO CENTER!!!!  Home-town HQ!!
Finally some real innovation!!
If only laptop manufacturers put keyboard stands on laptops..
Love your videos
Wow, this is so welcomed.
I think it would be really cool to have a transparent bezel or even the ability to swap cases to get a different colors if you want to switch it up i also think the possibilities for 3rd party stuff for this is gonna be really good and im excited to see what they do next
Remember they were talking about doing this with phones
I like how linus was so happy to get a new screwdriver he is a screwdriver fuck boy
We gotta support em bois, this should be the new standard!
I would love love love to have this laptop. Unfortunately I already have a great laptop that I'm using, but I might just buy this laptop at some point in the future to support them and sell my old one/give it to my little brother or something. I'm very excited and hopeful to see this company do well.
holy shit the webcam is good
This looks absolutely amazing
so just integrated dongles  jk, its cool
I should totally color code my screws from now on.
Webcam quality better than my TV.  "Respectable, huh!"
Activate Windows!
Guys the Pentagon is actually branded my g skill. G SKILL OWNS THE GOVERNMENT CONFIRMED
I now know which laptop I'll be buying if I need to go non desktop.
is there or will there be a version with dedicated graphics card tho?
This video answered my requests I've had for a decade...i'm not a fan of Proprietary stuff...and this checks all the boxes!!
DBrand should get on board to offer ton of skins.
linus almost dropped the laptop that his phone dropped instead, hence the crack when he show his phone.
ripping the wifi antenna cable connector off the wifi card sucks so much
I’m in love with this laptop thinking about getting it In the near future do you think this would be a good laptop for tuning cars the programs used for that can be pretty large
Framework x Volta module
i will buy this someday
Can't escape these annoying commercials !
Product of the decade love it
This seems absolutely amazing. Not the biggest fan of the design as I love the razer blade 15/macbook pro designs, but I might genuinely consider a framework once my current laptop is reaching the end of its lifespan... Hopefully they are still around by then
Seriously.. This is one of those situations where you vote with your $$. If companies see that this is a sustainable and profitable business model. They WILL change. I'm placing an order for 2 now.
the question  is can it run Crysis lol
Linus: I want my mouse plugged to the left so im comfortable Me: HOLY SH!T I thought i was the only one
I'll strongly consider it if they add some AMD options. Hopefully, they do add the touchscreen too. I'm probably asking too much for future pen support on top of that but, hell, why not?
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!! (Sorry, but you get my point?)
I'm literally looking for a back to school computer now and wondered why there wasn't a DIY build-as-you-see-fit system. Hardly 24 hours into my back to school computer search and I have unexpected answers!
Make a thicker gaming one and I'd buy it. And if it could have swappable graphics cards that would be even sweeter even if it was on a daughterboard or something.
This gives me some small hope for humanity
Niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Upgrades people. Upgrades
This video felt so authentic and personal (yes, silly to say about a laptop review). If I were in the market for a laptop, this sounds like a fantastic machine!
i feel like stuff like this have a lot of potential but, the long term support will be non existant
Omg I want it
this kind of company usually shut down after like, what, 5 years. Or at least they keep running but only available in US/Canada. Shit like this usually sounds too good to be true, either there are some manufacturing cost that they missed.. or someone just doesn't want them to exist, if you know what i mean. Idk, let's see i guess
Their website could use some work, seems to keep crashing on mobile. That could also be a result of increased traffic from this video though.
Do you think we can use this as a gaming RIG, with thunderbolt and a external GPU BOX, like 3060 ti?
This video will definitely help them a lot!
Bro, im putting money back for one now  I need a super-repairable laptop like this!  Edit 1: My order is confirmed to ship either today or tomorrow :) Ill report back when i have it and get to use it for a while and tell ya what its like.
The website's links seem to be broken though, it keeps bringing me to the home page when I press "configure now"
How about reviews of some toasters? As a gamer I don't know what toaster to buy!
Does it run Linux?
My faith in humanity is restored
HP elitebooks are repairable slim and good quality.
looks like they will need a new framework for there website this video sent to much traffic to them lol
Just make a 16inch with backlit keyboard and take my money. You guys made the blocktop come true even if the blockphone didn't work out.  You made my dream of a modular upgradeable slim stylish good looking ultrabook come true. You guys are GOAT JOAT and LOAT.
I was sold like halfway through this video. A customizable laptop?! No two will be the same. Personalize it!
When your laptop has usb type A on both sides😎
Apple needs to take notes
This will be my next laptop....
Sold.  This is what everyone's been asking for since the mid 90's.  I bet when they were putting this together they were all thinking LTT the entire time, instant access to an enormous and very interested customer base.
wtf thats awesome
Is it Linux compatible?
17:24 lake Minnewanka!  Was there today :)
Just bought my Dad a new Thinkpad. Which is OK, but I should've bought him this instead!
Their website is a little buggy. Keeps giving me errors. Did we hug it to death?
Aaand their website is dead XD
Website is down? It says something went wrong when I try to configure
I wish I needed a laptop lol. I have always thought "why tf can't you install a high quality phone camera into a laptop?!" and now that's a possibility
I think you gave framework the good 'ol hug of death. Most of their site doesn't work right now.
Dock?
Apple do something helpful? Not unless they can make a bucket load of cash from it...
Been wanting this for a long time... They just need to make the GPU and CPU modular with a drop in/out mainboard.  I'd happily pay more for those options in a 17" version.  Can't wait for the 3D printed homebrew modules. ;)
"The Dell's not even f***Ing thinner". Mic drop moment for Framework, lmao.
honestly, you tell me they will eventually offer different screens(touch or higher res), graphic card compatibility and more modules and ill buy one without even thinking and never go back to something else as long as they thrive. this level of openness and possibility should be encouraged and protected
Beautiful.  Hopefully they will encourage other OEMs to create their own add-on modules.
I've been looking for a good repairable laptop to switch to for my uni this coming year and I've generally been let down, either finding a laptop that is barely repairabl/upgradeable, or its just a fat ugly laptop that is more inconvenient to carry than my calc textbook... Honestly you just showed me the laptop I will be getting now, I will happily wait for the drop this summer! TIME TO GET SIGNED UP
here's a fun question when was the last time toshiba did anything interesting? that's what i thought
i think framework website is fucked from all the traffic XD I just wanna order one
why this guy everything he holds is going to break  in every video linus tech upload hahahaha
Graphic card?
Whaiting for the ARM version of this cutie
This product (and company) will fail. Soon.
The small details they made <3
Yo ARM and RISC-V? I'm sold.
The website crashed!!! I want one so bad!
Let me know when they have a premium GPU option
tbh I don't see how they're going to be profitable. If third parties start making those expansion slots, likely cheaper than frameworks own, how do they maintain revenue? Are they going to sell me a new motherboard every couple of years? Is it even worth buying *almost* a whole new system? or should I just buy a while new system?
OMG editor, you killed it at 11:55 I almost fell from my chair laughing
Coffe came out my knows when he said " I'm basically saying my girlfriends a terrible person." lmfao
I'm hoping for a tablet form factor with stylus and touch. That would be pretty sweet. I just hope they can be profitable.
Won't let me configure a laptop, just redirects me to the main homepage or tells me something went wrong. Maybe they're overloaded right now? Love it already.
A laptop gamer asked:  DOES IT GAME AAA GAMES?
Day 125 of thanking Linus for the daily uploads
Framework you need to make gaming laptops also and make its components as replaceable as possible
Too bad no Ryzen models
is it werid that im getting my RAM, Monitors, And Powersupply from a book store?
Can upgrade VGA in laptop ???
This is pretty cool. I'm not really into ultra-books tend to like either beefer "gamer" laptops or tablets that run windows like the surface pro. Still a neat idea and I hope they do well.
11:56 That is all.
My next laptop.
hey. you broke the config website :(
the concept is good, but unfortunately the website is still bad. "Configure now" and "create account" still not working.
I don't even want a laptop, but I want this laptop
The site is down... LTT generating some serious traffic??
This looks great, but I have issue with modules.  What happens if this company stops making the modules. For me to be truely upgradability, I like to be able to go to best guy or amazon and buy what is needed.  Now if you can buy these modules easily, or you can crack open module and upgrade it, I see limitations.
I mean, my old Dell Precision M6800 can upgrade the CPU and the GPU. As well as everything else except the IO. I like this idea, but I don't honestly see anything here worth an upgrade. Like, how many times am I going to want to change my IO? Storage is about the only thing one would need to swap. If the screen was swappable, at least. I could see some incentive. Buy it now for less with a cheap screen and upgrade down the line. But as it is, most of these upgrades seem pointless.
Not to mention, you can swap in new HDMI modules as new revisions are released, etc.
Yea. It looks great. But. This notebook will be your next company notebook?
Anyone else unable to configure? It keeps crashing on me *sigh*
I wanna see a creator community around developing 3rd party mods/extensions for this
God I hope this company takes off and in the future they make more modular and easy to fix products.
why are yall still wearing masks?
I need a laptop now. My business is going there once their website gets restored
Wow, this company sounds great
Making a point of having Linux drivers for the fingerprint reader? Take me now!
> No longer  *NEVER*
This is really impressive. Looking forward to shopping for a laptop.
Sold
This company will be R.I.P. if they got a grip on the market bec. others won't leave them alone... *Mark My Words*
Ok, but am I going to see you USING IT from now on?
1tb "fat" steam library. Looks at over 6tbs of games in the library. Ummmmm......
Thought my smoke alarm went off at 11:55
Tim cook’s worst nightmare: upgradability
9:54 Linus: “Be careful with these...you can rip them off the pads” learnt this the hard way😭
i think this is the company that Linus likes as much as his desktop pc
Wow, an upgradable laptop with slots to put things? This has never been done before! Maybe they can call it ExpressCard.
Linus when you asked at 7:34 I could easily answer this by saying less input lag.
Whats with the pops and clicks?
1000000% sold me. i legit had my jaw on the floor every time you said something that make me happy in my pants.
People don't even "like" to install their own "OS" so why!?
I hope these guys do well and become solid competitors in the market, so other brands become obligated to apply the same ideas as framework
Can't wait for their first gaming laptop, getting my wallet ready.
Reminds me of Phonebloks (remember when that was all the rage in 2013?). I hope Framework doesn't suffer the same fate that Phonebloks did, as these modular concepts really have potential it's just a shame they usually end up all suffering the same fate.
The website is a load of shit. Pressing configure now just reloads the website
I put my preorder in yesterday just before the site crashed. Please framework, release Ryzen mainboards for this laptop. PLEASE. Awesome to see this company get more coverage.
Not today, LinusDropTips
that is awesome,
why are these videos so low on brightness?
It’s great but…… I want dedicated graphics because all I really do on my laptop is game. So if they release another chunkyer version where I can put a gpu in it I’m down to buy it when windows 10 hits eol
i am a FAN!!! 2/3 of my USB ports broke about a year ago and i have been forced to use the USB port for exclusivly my headphones (a cheap pair of headphones snapped of in the mic port and it is a pain to clear those things out so i have to use usb headphones) and my trackpad ever since! i COULD go into the laptop and repair the usb port somehow on my own, but im scared i might break the laptop becuse i dont know what im doing, and id rather have a tad bit of extra suffering over not using a mouse then not have a laptop at all. I have looked at the options in my area and if i want to get it repaired it will cost me about $50 which honestly isnt worth it at all, specialy becuse getting it repaired means i have to go a week without a laptop. if ALL laptops where so easy to repair/replace parts with then i could EASILY replace the part of even repair the usb by myself in 10 minutes and save myself $50. This kinda laptop litteraly CHANGES the laptop industry. It makes upgrading your computer VERRY easy, so people would buy better parts wayyy more commonly, and it makes it so users can easily replace there parts (which in part means the company who sells these parts is making more money) so its a win-win for everyone involved. Why hasent every tech company adopted this model yet?!?!?
when this will allow changing cpu and graphic cards... it will be mine
Can you make a video about desktop GPU expansions with this laptop?
I would pay more for device with identical specs if one is fully repairable and supported by the manufacturer like this vs one that they intentionally make difficult to repair by doing things like soldering on RAM and gluing down batteries.
Dell won't be sponsoring Linus anytime soon!
so glorified dongles and a replaceable bezel
when repair technicians lead design teams
The gaming series probably will be launch in the future, i dont mind the size, but it have to be highly customizable
this is a really big deal, more brands need to do this.
Proof that Marketing Majors can't run a tech company. Only the engineers and designers can.
What are the specs?
gotta say, i'm impressed. I might go laptop after 3 generations of going desktop...but do they hate on Trump or his supporters? if I find out they do - well im out.
Dammit, I just bought a laptop ...I want this.
you and your friend when your mom bought the impossible thing you asked for as a joke 11:53
to be fair quite a few of the features Linus geeked out on are common on business laptops  but man that's cool and I wish there was a 2in1 version!
God, this is so awesome, I'm almost mad that im not currently looking for a new laptop.
Damnit Linus I try to check the website and it doesnt work well and Im gessing its due to your video
Now we are left with the question if it will sell well? The main goal of running a company is to generate profits while maintaining other things such as brand image, social responsibility etc…
Website is very glitchy
I would like to see an AMD version.
"Why make our products user upgradable when you can just throw it out and buy a new one?" - every laptop manufacturer, ever.
cant configure on the website.... error page.  cool laptop tho. ill return to try  again
Why did Linus buy the segue?
I always wondered what it would be like to see the "next level" of excitement from Linus ... now I've seen it all. :o)
Actually, didn't that transition buy you...
MAKE IT HYPE  so every company will need to start making them like that
Pretty sure the internet broke there website. From what I see I'm very interested, but I really would like to see a better display and a AMD option down the road.
I don't really see any true difference in upgradability yet. The ports are pretty minor TBH, basically just a bunch of recessed thunderbolt USB C ports with proprietary adapters.
How are things on the software side? No bloatware I hope
I really like this and want it to succeed. I'd be ordering one now if it had a discrete GPU
If you can't upgrade the CPU and the gpu then its not a real truely upgradable laptop IMO.
Man... I've been on their web site trying to order one but it keeps crashing!!! :(  I want this!
This shit is lit. I hope they ship to Europe soon!!!
Amazing device, but, my x230 Thinkpad from 2013 also has a hardware charge limiter that you can configure to protect your battery when you use it plugged in.
Anyone Remember Project Ara? kinda feels simi,ar, still a cool product
How about plug-able battery?
Modular. Google tried this with phones and it never came to fruition.
Very nice piece of hardware!
This is really cool. I hope they are around the next time I buy a laptop.
4:59 Fact
I want one, but I have no need for a laptop at the moment.
Y E S.
Damn this is really ingenious and I really hope that it succeeds. My only concern is the price of these "upgrades" and being proprietary ... but honestly you can't have it all. I 100% support this design and business model. This is how the world should conduct business, companies should trust their customers. Wow , this really just changed how I view a company
The storage expansion looks like a Xbox 360 memory card
Alex: "My girlfriend is a terrible person". Alex's GF: "That's it! We're done! Have fun with your Linus!".
Would be cool if we see 2 in 1 options and gpu upgradability
Once they make a AMD Variant, I'm all in.
Almost reminds me of expresscard for the port expansion. Although this seems good, I’ll still stick with an XPS any day. Interesting concept though.
What about external GPUs? 👀
I hope this laptop and the company that made it do well
I bet you only wear those stupid diapers on your face for the camera..
Well technically some laptop's can have a desktop CPU stuck into it. So that means it would be upgradeable but with certain power requirements and limitations. But now with green team dropping the mxm design the GPU's were kinda upgradeable, that's thrown out the window with Big green dropping mxm. Granted the current CPUs are pushing 8-10 cores, so they'll be usable for some time depending on the clock speeds.
I yearn for a day when this company is so mainstream that you could have a hand-me-down laptop chassis from 40 years ago with current gen hardware tucked into it. How much waste is created from perfectly good laptop bodies because the internals failed?
:POG:
Why don't framework put AM4 Motherboard in that laptop? So consumers can easily change Ryzen processor if needed
Linus: With Framework, i can do that ! ©
My acer laptop have a option to stop charging the battery at 80%, but the option automatically shuts off after a day or two HAHAHAHA XD
How do you upgrade the upgrade architecture? Pretty neat, though...
Actually promising. I think the ultimate 'hitch' in the future will be delivering quality components themselves.
This is good This is really good! This is what i want! I’m ordering one right now!
That "Activate Windows" is killing me 😂
Congrats on trending
I want to invest into that company. Wow. Absolutely cool.
that's the best laptop I have ever seen. I hope they can expand more and maybe I can get it on my country next xD
Was hoping for an upgradeable gpu/cpu tbh
Right to repair FTW!
this is like making me feel cared as a user when they make repair or replacement of a part so simple showing it isn't a moneygrab
I can't wait for this to take off. I'll get one when they have a 2in1 with windows hello :)
11:56 SOYMILK ENGAGED!!!
If you want this get in early and buy as many mods as possible. Enjoy it for the year it lasts. This has the same stench as Oneplus. Good for a year or two but the company will not last under this model. No one ever does. The other guys have too much push
Definitely waiting for the version with gaming graphics then seeing how much it costs just to turn away because I'm broke.
cant wait to see the first P.O.S. (definitely paid off) reviewer who bashes this device .
Linus pls stop shaking it while it's unscrewed
I really like the cinematic shots of the "Activate windows" notification. What about you guys?
What about gpu ?
The price is not actually that bad at all. The only thing that would prevent me from getting one of these when I need to get a newer laptop is the lack of discreet graphics.
Well I know what laptop I’m getting next I guess..
HEy, if they release an AMD one, I may jump on board, but Intel's tigerlake CPUs just do not cut it for me.
Where is the video, “Why do I use a wired mouse?”
PLEASE cover this again in a month or so
only thing i could have wished for is cinebenchscores or a mention of wether this was preproduction and the company asked not to give out performance stats or something like that
I went to their site and their configure page is down it just says something went wrong and this is only 6 hours after the video was posted lol
Well, I know where I'm getting my next laptop from
11:50 jesus we're getting into DEEP fried memes
Wait, Linus buys the sponsor segues? I think you need to have an emergency meeting with your business team. It's meant to be the other way around!!
really like this but for there next model they should make everything accessable from the bottom also and make an optional larger base so u can beef up the cooling and extra room for  bigger speakers 2.5 inch drives etc, or maybe a LMG cnc project for Alex
That battery disconnect bios option is something that should be on all laptops, especially when its always plugged in.
“MagSafe” usb-c cables have been around for a while haha
very cool. i was in the market for a desktop, but that bios power option and the upgradeability and modularity may have sold me on this instead.
That is so cool!
In a world where big companies are locking things away from end users and charging them money for the things they should've had in the first place, I couldn't be happier that there are companies such as Framework that actually go in the opposite direction. Makes me restore faith in humanity just a little bit
They're too precious, we must protect Framework!!!!!! They need to groww
Ok, that's one amazing laptop
While I really do like this laptop and its concept, I would be hesitant as will they still be around selling compatible parts/upgrades in 2 or 3 years?
The website server is crying right now.
Gimme
The way that Linus handles the products his showcases always makes me feel anxious 🥴
Actually they care about us and thats kind of rare to see
This is the best thing I've seen on the channel in a long time!!
Already issues with the website, anytime trying to configure you get landed on a something went wrong page.
their website is still getting annihilated lmao
An upgradable laptop that isn’t a gaming laptop, wow…
my laptop cpu actually can be removed and its gone pins and everything (got another one like it too)
upgradable wireless modules you say linus.... me actually course to random forums finding to whitelist the AX wireless card im trying to install.
No gaming benchmarks?  I'm guessing that "Iris Xe Graphics" just aren't very good so they didn't want to highlight it.
Have you disassembled a Dell latitude/precision? While this laptop has some nice perks, like the I/O, it's not that different from a support perspective
This is actually a really useful product review ..
I don't usually get as animated or excited as Linus does, but im hype for Frame.work.  I dont care what companies say.  This is progression.
Show me one with an upgradable GPU, then I'll check em out.
I hate to be this dude but... "Completely upgradeable Laptop?" -- yet cannot upgrade CPU. If we are really trying to be concerned about e-waste here, and frame.work has put so much effort into R/D - why not use a desktop CPU?
Waiting for a gaming laptop
If you can't put a proper GPU in it, it's a shit computer. Why does it have to be thin? It only has to go in a backpack or a bag to be portable. It doesn't even have to be rechargeable. When are you going to be away from an outlet? Cos then you'd be away from Internet too, and then you could do nothing with your life, like writing Youtube comments.
Framework: We are releasing an amazing modular laptop.  Linus: I’m about to destroy this whole company’s website.
IMHO Thinkpads are both elegant, repairable and contain pretty good hardware.  While they're not as excellent in the repairability stakes as they were, (some now have soldered RAM and SSDs) however I believe that the more business focused serieses (e.g. T-series) are relatively easy to repair (Lenovo publishes the repair manuals publicly on their website) and somewhat upgradable.  They certainly make most other brands look really bad in comparison.
Damn haven’t fully watched it but damn sounds good
Checks price Nope
Is no one else going to talk about the dead leprechaun under his sink ?
I would love this, however the amount of expansion slots is kinda small. I understand that a laptop cant have much due to it being quite thin but if it was possible i would have like 8 slots on my laptop
I hope this company has success with their philosophy. Want to be a late adopter.
Imagine full customizable gaming laptops 🌟
You know when Linus is excited about something when he almost tries to Frisbee it across the room.
what opportunity for them with these times of the right to repair and so many tinkerers and all that
6 hours later since upload website is still hitching.
This is looking GREAT. However, I don't like USB expansion cards, I want SATA and eSATA instead! USB is terrible.
The video is 7 hours old, and when you type the word framework into Google, the first autofill option is framework laptop.  I think they might be onto something :)
Honestly this is the way I pictured laptops in the future would be like back in 2010 and completely forgot about it until this showed up. This is a godsend and changes the game for everyone!
If they release a heavier duty gaming model with better cooling, they'll have my sale.
Is it just me or is this the first time Linus actually didn't have any super bad to say about a laptop.
I don't even need a new laptop and yet now I'm thinking about it.
Would be nice if their configurator actually worked instead of a "something went wrong" whenever you select something. Also only Intel. But a great concept and I'm definitely intrigued
Do a video with Ubuntu or PopOS running on it!
It is so rare to see an approach like this in our "don't touch the magic box and just enjoy your netflix" world. I really hope this influences the industry, because I feel like the insane amount of tech illiteracy and bad purchasing decisions we see today come directly from our manufacturers' secrecy.
fully customizable laptop, selecting where you want the ports that is really cool.. I would buy one.
I love it!! Also, all the tech companies that talk about environment and "being green" should have done this long time ago (but of course it wasn't their priority...)
There are ton magnetic cables on wish and aliexpress, fuck patents, thats why china is taking over the world.
Lol i thought Linus was about to say this video was sponsored by G - Fuel
Was the pricing ever mentioned?
O looks neat I might “intel”…. Nvm then.
I fail to see how this is "completely upgradeable".   Yes you can drop more ram and more disk space right onto the board, but propriety USB 3.2 "cards" are throwaway gimmicks that only ensure profit for the manufacturer.   When apple lets you plug in any dongle you want with thunderbolt its scary and encroaching on right to repair, but when these guys take it a step further with proprietary accessories using universal parts (use twice the plastic to have two cards over), they get a pat on the back.
Alright this is my new favourite laptop
I thought about this 11 yrs ago
Framework is about to get a lot of applications o.0
7:54 Linus seemed genuinely mad there
LTT team. Thank you for bringing this laptop to the wider audience. I have been following the framework team for a while. If they ever device to launch in India, I am buying.
Yeah, this is sick.
But this is NOT taking it far enough.  we can buy parts and buy our own pc for over 40 years now. why are we still forced to buy our laptops like we need to buy a console.. and be glad if we are even allowed to upgrade 1 or 2 things..  I want a concept like for pc but for laptop. **screens (1 complain I have about laptops is : tooo small.. I want 21 inch... but nobody SELLS 21 inch laptops....  But I not care for touchscreen.. others might want touch. I like fast IPS, others are fine with IPS.. I like 16:9 others want wider... give freedom to pick! **cases, I want a THICK full metal case, I not care for weight saving.. I want room for an optical drive, and room for that 21 inch screen (and a set of different bezzles with it so one could mount a couple different screen sizes if one wants tooo say a bezzle for 17, 19 21 and 23 inch with my case. Others want very slim and light... we should have the chooice. **a standardised laptop motherboard format.. so we could just put it in those laptops outselves... **I want the fast GPU but I do not neccecairy want a hyperexpensive cpu.. in most laptops those are paired. you cannot get a 3090 or 3080 paired with an i5 class cpu. **I want to be able to pick my own ram so I can get the best type. **and I do want extremely long battery life.. despite it being a gaming laptop.  a feature no gaming laptop delivers.. **I want to pick the camera, speakers and webcam options and quality myself. **I not want a touchpad at all.. but a larger full mechanical keyboard, totally fine with always having to plug in a mouse.  what is keeping the hardware manufacturers of pc components to just agree on a standard for laptopparts so they could be sold as pc parts are?  I have looked in the most obscure corners but while compagnies do excist that allow you more freedom in laptop configuration NONE will allow you to pick screens of 21 inch.. let alone paired with my other desires.
The framework website doesn't work for me. I was able to make an account. Purchasing or configuring was not an option.
I'd like to see a full size desktop CPU slot in the future.  It's not like a CPU's huge, you could definitely make it work.  I have an old IBM ThinkPad that has one - albeit that laptop's huge.
Linus looks like he's doing this review inside of a stock kitchen at Ikea, or is it just me?
Just curious; who downvotes a video like this? Those people must live in darkness and have a miserable life.
This might be the only laptop to replace my trusty T420 that I refuse to give up on.
this actually looks pretty cool. I am planning to buy a new laptop come January or so for a business expense and might take a look. I am curious how it does with video editing and stuff. My eyes have been on one of the xps right now.
If this continues on the path it’s going this could seriously be my next laptop.
haha, i think LTT broke the configure side of the framework website.
Just having a swappable wireless module on a normal laptop does not mean it is upgradeable.   I had to get a third party to mod my bios to allow me to install a different wireless card on my lenovo.
1:56 Linus must DROP his phone many times.
Got a 500 error from frame.work LTT hug of death
Linus : laptops have anti intrusion---.....- ( background muffling) Me: looking at my samsung laptop wondering how it could just die after a quick maintenance....... its in pieces now...
at +$3000CAD, the only question is: Can you mine ETH with it ? answer is NO so I will pass...
I hope in the future they are able to make a model with upgradable cpu/gpu!
Drivers? What are those!
Framework! Please make a chunkster version! I would totally get it! Not a fan of thin and lights.
I'm getting one 100% :) I'll wait a bit for the AMD but im getting one!
basically just make an upgradable laptop where you upgrade the graphics card. The rest of the stuff doesn't really matter
I think the sites broken
I already want to put a Raspberry or Aurdino on it.
This computer is evidence that every excuse for a pro-consumer laptop is B.S. Great webcam, bigger battery than my 15 fucking inch gaming laptop, excellent upgradeability, etc. I'm buying one.
famework>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>all other name brand laptop manufactures
A laptop made for people who actually know how to use them? Never thought I’d see the day
Website is down?
Pretty cool, I’m just not the target audience, my user experience ends right before I have to open or switch components for my laptop. 😂😂
they already have USB-C magnetic connectors that handle up to 120w power 40gbs(yes thunderbolt3)
Guys … this is awesome
Can't you just get a $50 thinkpad and upgrade it? That way you don't need to worry about a little dongle to plug in anything. Sure they're kinda old, but they are tried and true.
We are crashing there website LOL
This is the only laptop I feel good about buying.
3h just to open my laptop and remove dust...
Definitely getting me one of these! Hope this can take the throne of the best overall Linux laptop from the XPS
It’s not an LTT video if Linus doesn’t almost/actually drop expensive hardware immediately after unboxing it.
I will try to buy again later, the website crashes.
I love the premise. I'll be interested to see real world data and how it stands up to comparable models in other brands, both performance and price wise.
Please framework stay in business until I need/ afford a new laptop. Only YOU can keep em in business let’s pony up people
Hmm, I really don't need a new laptop, that's the only real down side I see here.
I want one... don't care if it's low end.
I challenge you Linus you must use that laptop for 10 years and get parts to upgrade it or Shut about that Vendor if you can't get parts 10 years later that laptop upgradeable  is useless so shut or put up I think you might agree with this 10 year challenge from this point now on you must use this as your daily driver for 10 years
LTT is buying sponsorship? Segues are not making any sense at all 😂
I was almost super interested. QHD graphics and almost everything upgradable.  But the graphic card. The graphic card isn’t upgradable and is apparently worse than my Radeon rx 580 from 4 years ago.   If it was at least marginally better, I’d be jumping to buy this. Not with that graphic card though.
You know the product is good when even Linus is ordering it.
I can see it now, when I wanna upgrade my motherboard/cpu, I take it out, 3d print a case and turn it into a server!
This truly does look incredible and I hope more companies have this option. I wish them all the success and hope their website was ready after this video haha
i'm a mac guy; and honestly if i didn't edit in final cut pro, take heavy advantage of apple services, and own an iPhone; i'd probably purchase one too, seeing as i'm about to be in the market for a new laptop within the next year.
upgradable, microphone & camera shutoffs, and even qr codes to help with putting it together?! I want one sooo bad that this might be the first laptop I've bought since 2006. (it was an upgradable asus laptop btw)
I like the idea of swapping out the ports to configure it how I want it for the task at hand, but a 13" screen is too small, and not having the keyboard width is even more of a dealbreaker with hands like mine.
We're sorry, but something went wrong
If and when I get one, I'll install Linux as the operating system. But as much as I like this idea, I'll probably buy a computer from a Linux manufacturer, like from Purism or System76, or other Linux manufacturers. But this certainly caught my eye and I will be keeping up on it.
A COMPLETLY UPGRADABLE LAPTOP?***  ***well except for the most important part: the CPU 😬
if my laptop breaks, I'm totally getting this
📈 Technology. 📉IQ of consumer.
Very impressive, what would be more impressive is up-gradable GPU and CPU.
11:54 i died
I had to check out the website after seeing this video. I bought my current laptop about 2 years ago and I'm not ready for an upgrade yet (and don't have the money for it) but as someone who travels a lot and is always working on the go, I like to game on my laptop as well as I can't justify having a tower PC in any given location knowing I will be spending less than 6months a year wherever that might be. So after seeing the portfolio of options available for the DIY config on the website, the only thing I could wish for on top of that is a better graphics card or if possible to make it upgradable which I understand is near impossible nowadays.  As far as the modular/expandable I/O slots, I love the idea and the website gives USB-C/A, HDMI, DP, MicroSD, SSD but no Ethernet. It says more coming soon so I hope Ethernet (RJ-45/Gigabit) is included in that. In a year or so I will be looking for a new laptop and if Ethernet and a better graphics card have a solution, I will definitely consider this option. Props to LTT and Framework for the great work!
Sold. just to be able to disconnect the battery. My Wife is on her 3rd battery and it never leaves her desk
11:55 - Linus does a Pogchamp!! Something you'll never forget!
I hope apple goes bankrupt
Amd ryzen and touch 2 in 1 display mod and I am buying
15:19
16:20 Subtle yet super neat changes. Feels like being babysit by them lol. Truly appreciates that.
Remember when laptops from before 2010 could let you change the cpus
Just shut up, and take my money!
when I need a laptop this is going to be my go-to laptop. I'm placing it already so I have it later.
I know laptop CPUs don't have pads, but they've got solder balls, which are basically the same thing but more vulnerable to corrosion. It's not too much of a stretch to design around that...
This laptop seemed like pretty much *exactly* what I was looking for. Not just on the upgradability and right-to-repair front, but on specs and form factor too (3:2 screen, glass touchpad, etc!), so I pre-ordered one a few months ago. This coverage has me pretty excited for when I'll get it. I went with the DIY edition so I'll be getting my own SSD/RAM.
And Linus has killed their website lol
This laptop look amazing.  In a dream world, I'd love a modular-ish GPU some how.
something i think would be really cool is if they actually payed the customer a little for their old unwanted parts, instead of people just sending them to the garbage. it would really help the sustainability of their products, and it would help seperate them and their consumers from the usual throwaway culture.
I love the concept, but i will wait till actual users report on their experiences.
11:56 The face (and sound) Linus makes when he sees a 32'' 4K OLED 360hz 1ms HDR2000 Monitor
System 76 need to use this as their next laptop slapping Core Boot and Pop on it
"They got a strong framework" OH GOD!!!
Yeah.. we'll see in a few years how this went. Just as Linus said: other companies have tried it and failed. Friggin Google tried to make it work on phones (remember Project Ara?) and failed. Right now, the only difference in upgradeability compared to, say that Dell XPS 15, is the external I/O. And I rather have a USB-C port than a HDMI-out I might not need all the time.  Maybe in a few years they will still be selling motherboard/CPU upgrades, and maybe we'll see new screen upgrades come out for this model, years from now. I very much doubt it. Too many companies tried and failed. Maybe if we're very, very lucky you'll still be able to buy replacement batteries for this in a few years, and that by itself is a nice improvement over most other laptops. Frankly, that is just not worth this much hype. Heck, ifixit has guides and replacement batteries for the Dell XPS series as well.
Do a phone next!
100$ FOR THAT THING??? OMG IMA ORDER IT RIGHT NOW!!!
I will buy an amd model, I just can't get behind current Intel
If it runs Linux like a dream, I'm in!
I’m calling it now… there’s no market for this. It sounds nice but really.. it’s not going to sell.
Now for the real test: will they ship to New Zealand?
if they included 17" screens and graphics cards, that would be even more interesting
i want one
Your Sponsor Segways are the Best!
The only thing I'd change is that I'd like to see at least a couple more expansion ports, but I really like this
RIP Project Ara 😭
i was hoping for a changeable cpu and gpu
Let's hope its in a reasonable price range.
I would be interested if they had an AMD model with gaming GPU.
This time Linus crashed even the product website, and not only the review parts.
Aaaand their website still can't handle all of us
What a great idea. Why in the world has no one already done this?
This first caught my attention when Louis Rossmann brought it up some months back. Good idea, but glossy only screen with not even an AR coating(this is HUGE for me)? No SD card? No AMD option? Not for me.
And here i thought that he wont drop things this time.....
Linus enthusiasm in this video made me want to buy this laptop
this is SO cool!!! so Cool !!! :D
People will think Linus’s enthusiasm in this is just because of a sponsorship or something, but I can tell when the man is jazzed 😄🤘
The web site for this laptop sucks everything you click on says sorry something went wrong
Dad jokes and girlfriend complaints with LINUS?
🥲
I love the pluggable HDMI, DP, USB-A, USB-C, Cardreader modules!! Plug-in what you need at that time!  Wouldn't have used a glossy screen, matte is more my thing.  I like this laptop philosophy a lot!!
Top 5 intros
Thanks everyone for crashing the Framework store lol
The biggest problem I see is that the target audience of tech enthusiasts typically like fast, powerful machines, with dedicated GPUs. This doesn't have that so that leaves non-tech enthusiasts, but those people are more concerned with other things and the majority of them couldn't be bothered to build a laptop that they most likely just need for productivity or media consumption.
But will it upgrade to w11? Or is that also optional hahaa. If youtube asks, this video changed my life.
Where's the mxm interface for a real graphics card?
Customizing where you want the ports is pretty sweet!
I've dreamed of devices like this
now add swappable cpu and gpu boards to make it fully modular and upgradeable and you have in my opinion THE ideal laptop. (shouldn't be too hard to do, small pcb with cpu/gpu soldered onto it that connects via something like a ribbon cable to the rest of the motherboard.)
If they add an ortho-linear keyboard as an option they will have the best laptop on the market hands down. And if they made a V2 where modules used PCI-E x4 or M.2 instead of USB-C, that would just take it to the next level. Imagine plugging in a module that hooks up to a PCIe direct eGPU. Since there are 2 modules side by side, plug in a dual unit for x8.
I have no need nor desire for a laptop, but boy howdy do I want one of these XD And how long before LTT makes some in-house micro case that's just big enough for that motherboard, a 500W PSU, and a RTX3090?  The real trick would be for them to duplicate the module socket design so you can add some/all of the modules to their micro case.  And of course someone MUST make an RGB module :)
Uuu, i love it
Once again, Linus brings down a website, lol. Every option I added kicked me to a "sorry, but something went wrong" page. Click back, repeat. It took me 40 minutes just to select the options I wanted, and finally got the add-to-cart button, and... Website crash. had to start all over, and I'm not doing that again, lol. I'll wait
They should add a donate option for those that want to support this vision but don't need a laptop.
This video gave their website the kiss-of-death with the rush of traffic.
I love the concept and want one but it should be said: no discrete gpu
SD LINUS on beze
Me: This laptop made me cry tears of joy! Apple: That laptop has a large touch pad, that infringes our our copyrights!  Sue them to death!  We had to, we couldn't let our customers go having choices and not need to buy a brand new machine every time 1 component breaks how would we make any money? Apple Fans:  I can't believe the build quality on this junk!  There is a small lip on the expansion slots that is completely unacceptable, and I'm happy to pay $5k more for a less powerful, less upgradeable, less convenient laptop so the small lip doesn't hurt my sensitive hands.
I wish I had known about this one month ago.
Finally a DIY laptop Louis Rossmann can't hate this one
Playing devil’s advocate here, the XPS 15 probably isn’t thinner than this laptop because it has a gtx 1650 it has to cool.
Iris Xe Graphics = Automatically e-waste
wow, now this company i would be happy supporting!!
Wait wait wait wait, the CPU dont have to be soldered. 2nd gen Intel used PGA for their CPU back then...........however, if intel changed that designed for whatever messed up reason; would it not be possible to use desktop CPU's with bios designed to lower the TDP to make sure if can run in a laptop, or am I being too optimistic with that....OR OR OR, modified CPU's with the CPU soldered to a breakout board (like what Linus showed a few years ago), then sell those as an upgrade path.
I am not convinced because their website doesn't sell mainboards individually.   It is not Completely upgradeable until so.
I think this video crashed their website...  "500 Internal Server Error If you are the administrator of this website, then please read this web application's log file and/or the web server's log file to find out what went wrong."
anyone else hear that music?
I have a question 1. Why do laptops/PC still use HDD as their secondary storage? Isn't using SSD better? Why not just use SSD as both primary and secondary storage? 2. Linus said that he used a 1tb SSD but he wouldn't use it as the boot drive. Why?
No gpu?
pain.
Comparing this constantly to Apple seems...odd? Like Apple doesn't even pretend to cater to the market that would buy this laptop. This thing is super cool and as someone that loves building computers I'd love to see this become popular. That being said most people are content on just getting a whole new device instead of upgrading parts individually, and wouldn't want to be bothered with ANY screws, be them easy to remove or not. I truly understand Linus' excitement and totally share it but Apple isn't in the same market as this thing, the people who will buy this are people like Linus and his viewers. Last I checked Linus and his viewers already aren't fans of Apple so why even bring it up other than to trash talk for sake of trash talk?
That camera alone is better than high end laptops.
I want one
If they come out with a Ryzen option, this will be my next laptop.
Ok someone coreboot this and I’m sold
They had me at spare screws 🥲
I’m considering this
A version with dedicated graphics in the future would be super awesome, although I have no clue how that'd work lol.
Im guess the reason these laptop companies don't make their laptop repairable is because when you break it they want you to buy another one
Trying to configure and all I get is a "sorry something went wrong". Sigh. I think they've been tipped.
next few newer versions, "we need to limit user serviceable for the heck of security and stay profit"
Can someone make an updated video on Linus dropping products
I work at sea so travel a lot and I've always preferred towers to the point I've got a node case and crammed everything in. This is so tempting though it's what I've been after for years! I think they will do really well out of this tbh. I think I'm going to put some money down. 🍻
Why's his phone cracked 🤨
Mom : why do you need that? Me : for school
Being a firm believer in the concept of "You don't truly own it unless you can repair/upgrade it yourself", this makes me so happy. I remember being a kid and seeing the concept for the modular phone and being saddened by it turning out to be a bust. Glad to see these guys picked up the torch.  I already bought a Lenovo Legion 5 2021 and beefed it up, but if these guys make a gaming/workstation version of this laptop, I'm absolutely pre-ordering as a replacement for the Lenovo
The US goverment also said " you can repair it yourself" the FTC made it so companies have to provide manuals and such so users can fix there own devices
apple will hate this
i want one..... no two, so i can interchange there parts
If only they could make it not ugly
when ever i try to look at the laptop it just says the "sorry were busy" or some shit like that
Tried to order one..  no go :(
2021 were even laptops have a item shop
Surface should be like this
I CANT ORDER DAMN IT,  THE WEBSITE IS FILLED WITH USERS WANTING TO BUY! 😂😂
Wow 😳
*I love this, it IS the future, and I wish Framework success for bringing it to market. "However", since they're still a young-ish company, I want to help steer them in the right direct. 1. "modules" **7:25** Hot Swappable=Awesome but to avoid all slots being taken without getting all the connectors I want give me "Large" multi-facet connectors that I can plug "HUBS" into, that way, I can have as many as I want (beware bottlenecks) 2. The CPU, sure, they SAID, ARM, X86 and even RISC 5, but I'm sorry to say, I demand that. Intel for me is a deal breaker. 3. **14:31** The unattended driver installer is EXCELLENT, "but", A) the user should be prompted so that "unstable" drivers don't catch them by surprise and that should come with easy roll-back feature. B) that installer better have P2P or better because SPOOFING updates and cloned security certificates have zombied more computers than I care to imagine. 4. **16:28** I would LOVE to disconnect my battery completely but I think Lithium doesn't like that, so can I have the best of both worlds? I want to run off the wall socket, but keep a bare minimum charge of about 5% to make sure the battery doesn't just DIE. (not entirely sure how batteries configure that 5%). 5. I want my OS in a bootable drive so that I can time it's install or change my mind at my discretion. 6. I want SERIOUS cooling options even if they have to get inventive. 7.UNWANTED ITEMS/FEATURES, I don't want a "fingerprint reader" please, don't charge me for that, don't need an "integrated" webcam, again $, I'm a little divided on a touch pad AT ALL (sometimes useful if the driver on your USB won't allow you to plug in a mouse). Some things that are standards or norms are things I've never used (for privacy/security/quality reasons) and will never use, so if I can remove them and if it even takes a few bucks off the bottom line, HURRAY! IN CLOSING: sorry I wrote a book but I MEANT IT, when I said I wish them well, and I'm assuming they will read this. They have a golden opportunity to become an industry leader if they get this right, and the consumer deserves WAY better than what we're getting. "Good Luck".*
You can get magnetic USB charging cables. The connectors are low profile.
I hope the best for this product and the company. Finally an upgradable portable PC that make sense. Imagine the flexibility that a whole ecosystem will provide.
I never thought I'd see the day where I'd actually want a laptop. Does it come preloaded with an OS?
If I had money, I'd legit buy one. Who subscribed to this channel does NOT get a boner from this?
This is really freaking awesome,am starting to browse for a new laptop too - so like if these guys start shipping to Australia that would be grand!
WHY am i smiling and so happy about this computer. god damn it.
Really a very nice device.
If a 2-in1 option becomes available in the next few years, I'll absolutely buy one. My current choice is the new Galaxy Book Pro 360 which isn't very upgradable at all.
Remember PCMCIA cards?
I'm going to buy this when it's fully released
Sure I could use a new laptop But I don't think I have seen a random review, that made me try to instabuy something before. wow
this laptop thicc as your mother, absolutely pc trash thing
Hey Linus! Activate Windowwwwws🤔😏😏😏
11 min linus hits nail on head its a gimmick, no different from a normal laptop
What I'd really like to be stoked about is something that for a while will remain to be seen. Will they hold the same motherboard form factor for long-ish periods of time so even if a product outlives its usefulness it becomes a single part replacement and not a full system swap? That would truly make this machine great.   If they want to make me dump my money immediately and pass my existing laptop off to someone else all it needs (I say as though it would be an easy task, it isn't) is interchangeable GPUs through something like an MXM connector... The reason my gaming laptop is a rather cheap one, and that still have a gaming desktop comes down to upgradability, when my 1650 max q is out of life then the laptop ceases to be a practical gaming laptop and the full cost of replacing what might be an otherwise adequate machine is significantly greater than getting a new graphics card in my desktop, and potentially more wasteful... I bought an alienware with a 2070 off a guy for $20 because the GPU had died making the rest of the PC useless aside from RAM and the WiFi card (and the storage I guess but he understandably kept those parts). I'd love a world where I could say "no problem lets pop the back off here and get a new graphics card, she'll be good as new when your part gets here" rather than "sure I can fix it but the cost of the full motherboard replacement even with a used board is only a $70 less than getting an entirely new machine after the labor cost"
CPU is soldered. So it's not that good after all
Wow they really need to hire people to fix their web site
Damn I just bought a new laptop a month ago and now you show me this little engineers delight of a laptop XD... I think I know what my next one will be! Framework - 2in1 + touch design PLEASE!
Linus said something about not being able to upgrade the CPU or Motherboard?  On the framework website it says yes that is possible and gives instructions on how to do so.
ps.  i love anthony over all yall
I hope these guys live up to what they're trying to do, because I havent been this excited for a laptop in a long while
One of these with an AMD APU would be amazing. I love what this company is doing!
Has anyone seen Linus buy anything during a review... ever?
When the clear keys are illuminated and shown from the top they almost look like the A from the Avengers movies :)
I really want stuff like this to work.  But i've seen similar concepts fall very much to dust, like Nvidia's module MMX GPUs...that you could never find anywhere after launch.  It's all well and good until the company making the modules disappears, single point of project failure.  Also i can see the modules being very exclusive and overpriced to spec.
“UPGRADABLE AND REPAIRABLE LAPTOP” Cost to repair speakers laptop: 300 bucks
I do hope that they can stick to the ethical repairibility and also still be profitable
How much of the design of these things is open source? Are the motherboards available to be purchased by themselves? Is there accessible schematics for the motherboard?
9:46 I thought Right to Repair was about being able to repair your IPhone, not other options. Parts available for every product to repair whatever goes wrong
So, Linus. What's your favorite anime?
I have no use for a laptop at the moment, but if I did, I'd buy one these.  I like pretty much everything about the machine, and I love the company's attitude.  I hope they do well.
If they make one with 360 hinge and touchscreen I'd buy one
15:19 I already use magnetic USB C cables for my phone. I got one that has like 7 concentric rings on a nub your put in your USB port and the cable just has a row of contacts. Gets full speed charging and data transfer because of it. Wish USB just had a standard like that to make it even better.
just bought a spectre x360 but boy does this look like a good product
What I love about this video is? Linus pulls his Note9 out of his pocket.. he can have any phone in the world.. And still rocks the Note9.. I have a 512gig one.. It has more storage than a mates $2.500 Apple laptop.. 🤣😅
I dont like it... it is going to leave me without a job. Jk i can always rebrand to just phones or industrial.
And Frameworks site is borked by so many people logging in.  Way to go Linus Break Tips!  Seriously though, I've been thinking of getting a thin and light like this as a companion for my gaming laptop to do work and not need to be tethered to a power outlet.  This seems downright reasonable and sustainable.
I'm getting one of these
didn't dell made something similar way back few years ago?
Antidumbass laptop
First laptop with modular capability? Why no mention of PCMCIA?
This or System76's laptop? 🤔
its everything all laptop manufacturers don't want you to have. 😂 this company need more exposure to keep the competition on.
It's awesome to see Linus so jazzed about a product. He always tries to be enthusiastic in videos but this feels especially genuine.
i didnt even skip the segway this time that case looked cool af
Ok I have never wanted to order something instantly until now
What ? Intel and affordable but no  Thunderbolt?
Framework seems to be pro right to repair
_Me waiting for the webcam quality_ *it was better than big branded laptops* Me: Aight time to invest
This is a breath of fresh air.  I just wish Linus hadn't broken their website by sending so many people there.
I really hope that this sets a new standard so that laptops will be as customizable and upgradable as desktops. One can dream.
Why moog have lighter voice, this video without music and alone?  Ah disrespected video
framework makes apples design team look Actually physically and mentally and in all reality Factually RETARTED.. the next apple i mac will literally be drule and used diapers in a box.
The Framework site is really having a hard time after this video came out. I'd assume that is a great sign.
The thing that bothers me about this is the potential e-waste. There is a lot in that box that I'd never use.
Is this something I can get in Australia, sounds fecking awesome
They are just desperate, wait till they get really popular.
1:58 not surprised your phone is cracked Linus 😂😂
If they start offering swap GPU module/motherboard, I'll buy two.
Pretty cool
Yaaaaassss! More upgradeability customization Pleazzeee! :-D
Wish my school used these instead of lame google chromebooks
But does it run Linux?
Man, this is really cool. But I'm not ready to live on Intel Xe graphics no matter how cool I think a product is.
man i would love to look more into this but their backend seems to be down from the traffic
This laptop is so good that 30 mins after Linus posted this video, the website crashes everytime you try to buy it.
would be perfect if it has a windows update disabler
I want it, I want it, I want it... no ... I NEED IT.           But in all seriousness, this is a wonderful idea and holy shit it really is affordable all things considered. hell someone on a tight budget could literally buy the cheapest functional build, and just upgrade as you get more funds, or savage a few pieces from an old laptop.
Narrator: Linus is finallyhappy.
I hope the day comes when we will be able to swap cpus as well
Skinnier toughbook
It is 26 July 2021 and one of you is still wearing a stupid mask.
Remember seeing this on tested a good while ago, been waiting for Linus to get a video up on it
Microsoft and Apple. Cry me a river.
ryzen intel?
this concept is a breath of fresh air. so nice to see a manufacture with similar goals to the end user!
@linus make support for this company its amazing
14:31 LMAO  Linus has had _enough_
Haven't we had several attempts at this?
i want a laptop heavy and strong enough to Brain Lefty Woke biggits in to a coma.. a mac book aint gonna do that.
I was all set for my next laptop to be from System 76. Now I am torn!
I really want to buy one, however I'm in Eastern Europe region, so I have no clue how much is the shipping gonna cost, and how easy/cheap would it be for me to find/order parts here.
I feel like this is a huge threat to big brands like Apple Dell etc
15:53 ugh magnetic charging is ass tho
this is awesome!
Commenting until LTT send a PC✌️
Did Linus break their site?  I went right over to their site to try and check out a laptop and I couldn't change the CPU without getting an error on both the Canadian and American site!  Oh well... I guess I can wait :)  A question though about the modules... with a USB C interface could they just be connected to any other computer? That storage drive becomes really useful it's essentially a USB C Drive that just happens to slot into the laptop
10:50 Pretty much....
Anybody wonder if it will be bought by Apple?
When you pay enough to get your product on the main channel vibes.
if you really support freedom and the right to repair, you need to buy this even if you don't need it.
this is what happens when a company actually tries to be good instead of just trying to get as much money as possible
This is cool for a work/school laptop, i wonder how it's going to be like on a gaming laptop
I love this idea. My MSI laptop has been decently upgradeable and reliable, but this idea is genuinely amazing. If I hadn't just sunk almost $3000 into a desktop I'd buy one right now.
I really love the idea of Framework! I really, REALLY hope that they succeed and wish them all the best!
Nothing wrong witha wired mouse, I still only will use a wired mouse myself....
This is so good for companies that do their IT in-house. They will actually be able to repair their laptops now, having much less downtime waiting for an RMA to go through, The other nice thing is they can have more custom computers for each roll. 1 can have a touch screen, while another has more I/O.
I need this
I kept being told tech was being made unrepairable in order to keep them super sleek. I'm just like "I don't care. Make it fat. I just want to be able to freely upgrade and repair it." Then these guys make what I want, and it's sleek too. I still don't care that it's sleek, but whatever.
i want one, if i like it and its awesome, even if i dont need it, ill still upgrade the whole damn thing just because they want me to just upgrade here and there, just because they want me to save money, its will be "so you have choosen full upgrade". they give me the choice, well i want them to shut up and take my money each year if i like the product
Am I the only one that wants this to have a ethernet jack that accepts POE power
That's a broken-ass phone Linus!
Im definitely investing
Boss level laptop 👨‍💻
10/10 design. holy shit.
this comment is important just kidding
This looks amazing. When I need a new laptop, I'd like to get something like this
Good to see his sponsor transitions are still as horrible as ever lol 😂. Love your vids
Dell latidude e6410 laptop with remo.  Cpu
I hate slim laptops and devices.
I am not a fan of Intel, but I can't lie, I ordered one before the video was over, everything about this product was everything I want in a laptop sans 2 things which is an AMD Ryzen CPU and a Nvidia GPU, however, with the lack of modern high-end AMD APU/Laptop based CPUs and the Chassis being as small as it is, so it seems unable to hold a GPU even a "mobile" SKU I can't complain. Hopefully with their plans to offer interchangeable MoBos they will have one with the new Ryzen 5700G APU.
my brain this hole video long : UPGRATES PEOPLE UPGRADES
Okay, I _need_ one.
So basically they are actually encouraging you to 3d print/CNC/DIY a case to actually use the working mobo when you decide to upgrade down the line and not simply throwing it away. Is the screen connector proprietary or can you simply buy a new one (like from eBay/Aliexpress) and connect it?
It's not that I don't like how some companies won't try to do this type of thing... That's the bread and butter. It's that they might try this type of modular thing, and mark up everything and mutate the concept so it becomes another nightmare of licensing, DRM and planned obsolescence.
9:25  Is it just me or did he put the two connectors in the opposite spots
This is movement in a positive direction
I'm legit thinking about buying this laptop. I'm on the market for a new laptop and this is actually in my price range.
CAD FILES!?? FUCK YES
Wow! I don't need another laptop, but dammit I want one since these folks really seem to get it
anyone else getting the infinite loop of "something went wrong" when trying to order the laptop on their site?
ive always preffered a macbook but damn thats gotta be one of the best laptops to come out in the last decade!
*THIS* is the way ahead.  Never been a big fan of laptops due to the lack of power, configurability or expandability, but this.... I'd get into bed with this, and if it was Linux, we'd have an even better time!
Did I miss pricing?
Is it an LTT video if Linus doesn't drop something?
My boy Louis Rossman would love this laptop
Frame.Work = "We're sorry, but something went wrong", over and over again.
louis Rossmann approves of this message.
Honestly I'm just waiting for all of the modded ports
Linus you broke their website.
Imagine if they designed cars like this
I really hope they keep the mainboard standardised. I'd love to have one of these but with Ryzen or RISC-V. One missed opportunity I see though is a lack of "double width" expansion ports. The single slot expanders look really nice, but don't really allow you to have more than 4 ports. If they had a double-width version that didn't have that center post, I could easily see it accommodating 3 or 4 USB A ports on one side.
The real future has arrived
Does this thing run Arch?
I feel like and idiot for buying an m1 MacBook Air now
Looks amazing!
This is awesome! This is some by the people for the people kind of stuff
The only other thing I think needs addressing is the stigma against “making products too good”. Not only would Framework secure a nice part of the market if they make good on their promises in the following decades, their names would be remembered as fondly as Steve Wozniak, Bill Gates, even Steve Jobs.
We broke their site, I think this is a good thing. Keep it up Framework
razer is all BARK no BITE
This is the only laptop I've liked for a long time
BULLSHIT. Upgradeable by whom? A person with 20/50 vision, or a person with 20/20 vision WITH magnification?
Give us an AMD CPU option and I will buy one instantly!!
Maybe the biggest thing is just affordable replacement parts. I cracked a laptop chassis, and JUST the chassis, just the piece of metal with no electronics, and the replacement part cost $500 USD. For a piece of metal. In a $1,000 laptop. I don't mind companies having a profit margin on replacement parts, but that profit margin should not be 2000%.
I’m buying one of these for uni. 100% It’s almost like a very upgraded raspberry pi
You can actually hear Linus getting emotional about this laptop. Who hurt you Linus?
LTT... I very rarely throw likes around... but this...
They literally made the laptop just for Linus.
Now THAT'S a laptop I want!
It's about time a company did this. :-)
I legit had this idea as well when type C started getting traction 2 years ago, and hads the idea for a removable and expandable keyboard, track pad, basically what this is. WHICH IS FLIPPING AWESOME. I'm so glad someone else also thought if this.
I don't need a new laptop, but I want one just to support this project. Now if only there was an ISO keyboard... Also, no pre-orders from sweden. Gah...
I'm sold also
Shut up, and take my money
Found me my next laptop. Finally. Thanks LTT.
Linus looks soo amazed 😄
This is just any geek dream come to life!!Props to Framework guys!!!
The minimalist and labeled design of the inside of the laptop is amazing. I am seriously considering one of these now!
Anyone else having issues on the website? I think Linus was too convincing
Can we talk about how the packaging is all brown cardboard? No glossy, plastic covered cardboard garbage.
Sent this video to my dad cos he's a tech professional and hates the lack of easy upgradability in modern laptops but he's colourblind so the screws will probably just confuse him.
When the engineers get the only word on a laptop design we get framework I've watched most of the reviews on it and dang it looks like they actually got it right and give a damn .
Linus their site has officially chrashed
This kinda reminds me of the Insta360 One R, despite being a different type of tech. Specifically due to how modules slot in.
I'll wait for AMD options, but this is probably going to be my next laptop.
I think we just took down the homepage. Wanted to se how I could configure a laptop and what it might cost. Now it just say: “We're sorry, but something went wrong”
Wow
Upgradeable? Repairable? A battery that can be programmed to remain at 50% forever when plugged-in all the time? Hey, it's just like my 2010-era Lenovo T510 ThinkPad that I bought used for $300 in 2014 and have been daily driving ever since. Upgraded to an SSD. Upgraded optical drive to play BluRay movies from my extensive collection. Okay, the T510 is certainly not thin and light. But it has been around the world. Cheers.
Yup. Once they make a touch screen model, I'm buying one
Shut up and take my money!!!!! Like seriously! Next work laptop!!!
If I were US president. I would give them a massive tax break. For saving the environment. And for being pro consumer.
Ah no preorders to Australia yet. Would have got one straight away I'll have to wait 👍
Thus looks easier than a pc
make it Ryzen and we have a deal
The thing about the battery disconnect is false. It is for opening the device without risking a short with your tools. However a charging limit would be great like on Dells
You guys look ridiculous with your masks on all the time
11:54 Every Mech keyboard enthusiast ever
thing thing is so cool wtf!!!
Anyone notice Linus rocking a cracked back phone there 1:58 into video. Should be using a dbrand skin or cover there mate.
Impressive. Hope it gets popular & becomes a standard.
I have found my next PC
Not in the market for a laptop. But that seems awesome. Wish them success in their operations. If they catch on can hopefully change things over a incredibly long time.
the bar just got set higher for other companies!
Is frame.work listed on any stock exchange?
I'm glad someone at last went through with this idea, lovely. BUT: battery is integrated? ok... make it two pieces and hot swappable. get rid of integrated camera/mic. smaller speakers to gain some more space (no one uses them to listen to music). make your modules smaller and sell them as separate usb modules too. swappable screen (yes), and make them usable through different models. also upgradeable gpu... just sell parts and/or license oems that want in.
Replacing the motherboard ought to be pretty cheap and basic, since the only thing that's soldered to it is the CPU and everything else is meant to be modular. If they work on upgradable dGPUs, they could have what many tech enthusiasts have been wanting for the past 20 years. If I didn't buy a new laptop a few months ago, I'd have bought one of these.
The webcam is so great!
Idea: get a really bulky laptop and make it a sleeper buy adding a lot of CPU's, GPU's, RAM, Coolers and finally add a really strong battery     Now that's what I call a Beast gaming laptop If I've ever seen one
I will siriously consider buying one in a few years when my laptop is useless if they still exist.
Wow this looks really nice. EDIT: Unattended driver install!! YES!! YES!!
yay!! the dark intro Love it!!! Thanks for that LTT ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Impressive, Framework.
just open this world wide so we can order already
Can't wait for a 17" framework laptop. I really like my Dell M6800, which has a replaceable CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD slot, and Mini PCIe slots. If Framework can release a 17" laptop with a replaceable GPU, it will be an insta-buy from me...
What a great laptop
It looks like a thinkbook
now I know which laptop to buy next
I wonder if all laptops will be like this in the future or if the idea will be killed since  company's want you to buy a new laptop every couple of years
lmao we crashed the configure page on there website.
Alex saying "They've got a good framework" actually made me laugh out loud so hard.
I'm checking the website now and at first it wouldn't load the configurator. Now the whole website died :/
I love this, but I also know how dumb the average consumer is. So it's unlikely they will take off, depending if they get enough investors to throw their financial weight behind the company. And given the stock, logistical, and marketing state of Framework, things don't look good. Like I would buy one, but their website doesn't work.
This is simply amazing.
I gotta get me one of those!!
"Basically I'm saying my girlfriend is a terrible person." RIP Alex :(
Hope this won't end in the same path as Alienware 51M
Serious question tho....who the hell still buys apple products ?
I hope they grow to ship internationally, but I also hope they don't grow too much, because that is what ruins cool companies like this.  Beyond a certain point, when stocks are starting to be traded, and business folk get hired, it is only downhill. A small team of engineers can keep up this fantastic spirit, devotion and enhusiasm, but when things get corporate, ethic falls apart and the only drive left is maximizing profit, customers, environment and employees be damned. Soon they get involved in politics, employ child labor, abuse the trust of their users and most loyal customers while not trusting them back, engage in court warfare to weed out competition, use their monopolstic position to extort the most money possible from people and institutions including small businesses and schools, and to destroy competition, buy reviews, take government contracts to spy on people or aid with murder... Prime examples: m**rosoft, a**zon, g**gle, a**le, fac**ook, or**le, d*ll, sa**ung, hu**ei...
Brings a tear to my eye!
I’ll need a laptop for school when I go for my second round. This is at the top of my list I was previously looking at Microsoft surfaces
I absolutely want one of these, but I don't really use my laptop for much heavy lifting and I feel like it's a little against the spirit of the thing to Chuck my still functioning old laptop for it. This does have me kind of hoping it kicks the bucket soon though lol.
This is Epic but I hope that I can change the graphic card and motherboard
Dude this laptop is sick this is definitely gonna be something I’d consider for school
now imagine laptop components in a desktop with desktop cooling and power, sure you lose portability but it would make for a powerful sff pc that's smaller than the usual sff pc.
Nice teeth you got there Linus... ,)
The main thing NOT covered here, how is the performance compared other equally priced laptops? Rough conversion gives around $650 as starting point for other laptops with this CPU (17:00 - $749) Thats not that cheap, wont sell enough machines to stay in business so the upgrade path is most likely a mood point
Linus: this is a reasonable priced laptop I will buy one Linus's 13.7m subs: I think I will too Framework's website: not strong enough framework for Linus's 13.7m subs.
As soon as they sell touch displays, I'm immediately buying one!
This review genuinely looks like the most fun the LTT crew has had doing a review in a long, long while.
Their site is getting the hug of death 😄. Can’t even pre order one with out the site crashing. Glad to see them getting the attention they deserve. I really hope they succeed and stick it to traditional manufacturers.
twin turbo 2.7 litre v6 from ford
I'm not sure this is more than a novelty.  The port adapters are great and all laptops should use something similar.  But in 4-5 years when a buyer would be looking to upgrade this to TB 3rd gen, a 16TB SSD and 256GB RAM they're out of luck.  Unless they want a seriously backwards CPU, and I don't see a decent GPU in there anywhere.  A little hard to fit a modular GPU perhaps?  The Dell XPS you compare it to can be had with an RTX 2060 or 3060 or whatever.  The point however is that when time comes to upgrade the platform won't be interesting, and most people will just buy a new laptop to upgrade the platform.  The exception is when buying a bargain 8GB laptop or such today, but they are at an entirely different pricepoint to begin with.
just curious if anyone know what the refresh rate of the panel is? however if it becomes upgradable in the future, this is a company anyone should invest in
I tried to configure a device and "500 Internal Server Error If you are the administrator of this website, then please read this web application's log file and/or the web server's log file to find out what went wrong." Maybe I'll wait a few months
This feels like it is too good to succeed somehow.
I'll definitely be looking into this!
Did you buy it with Bitcoin?
This has to be one of the best products I have seen in a long time and am actually excited for. I just wish they sold them in Australia 🦘🦘🦘
If they ever come to Brazil, I'm for sure going to buy one of these! Please do come to Brazil, please!!!  (The keyboard here is slightly different, that's why I would rather wait than buying now)
I don't suppose they have a keyboard with a trackpoint?  ...Shut up, nub mice are awesome.
So I guess it's a wait and see regarding cpu/gpu/mobo swaps.
The last laptop you will ever buy
I pre-ordered one of these and the only thing missing that I'd love to have a module for is 4G/5G.
We are past the point where the big guys needed to be doing this. Such an important approach to tech sustainability.
This laptop is perfect for enterprise environments.  I've never seen a more easily serviceable and upgradeable laptop.  It's affordable ţo buy and possesses a lot of value, so the finance department could be more willing to buy equipment
Yea, good luck at finding a GPU and CPU which would fit in the specific slot there is available.
I hope framework really takes off and the engineers make profit so they can continue to innovate such awesome upgradeable, modular and customizable tech.
"I bought a sponsor" Linus 2021
I was hoping LTT would do a video on this! The exposure will give it a massive boost.
12:48 ubiquity laptop
Lol this video crashed the frame.work website...Opps something went wrong when trying to configure a device!
Love your videos mate windows 3.1 intel 75mhz 32mb sdram 300mb hhd  all the way
Kinda glad their website is dying or i might have bought one immediately. Definitely want one
Commercial suicide... but thats why its great
I love it, and if i have the money in the future i would buy one.
Almost sold me. No touchy is a deal breaker.
This is the future I was promised
anyone else having issues getting on?? haha
lmao I got a Nintendo Switch ad
This looks awesome
you better have full proper storage drive encryption on that computer! or hackers are going to try too get all your data and try to steal that computer to get all your youtube money! easy to repair computers are always have a big problem of attracting computer thieves that work for dark web data hackers to your house or job site! they get attracted to easy to repair computers like a homer simpson to a donut and beer food convection! this is why apple and other computer companies stopped making there computers easy to repair to stop computer hacker dark web chop shop criminals to stop stealing all their stuff out of there customers  workplaces and homes!
Im buying, fuck dell
Damn, I'll definitely consider buying this to replace my Late 2013 Macbook Pro.
"I mean, I didn't say anything"... lol
this company should make a desktop pc where you have slots on the front of it for modular things and larger slots on the back for things like graphics cards and large drives, etc.
I want a laptop with a full graphics card in it. i dont care if its a chonky bastard. I want a laptop that can run any game at a reasonable price. like 1k or something
Not in the laptop market, but definitely leaning in their direction.
This laptop gives me hope.... Especially that camera. After seeing that HP video
Well their store/configuration page on their site is overloaded now. Hopefully that means this video had a big impact and they've sold a boatload of units already.
I think we nuked the site. I'll try again tomorrow.
But...can it game?
Linus' appreciative emotions are almost enough to make me tear up.
--- So this is basically "Eve V" but instead of a singular customer-demand-design now you can have almost anything you want assembled to your preferences around the "base/core" alongside the future upgradability.  And the (current) starter Do-It-Yourself-kit has numerous very good high-quality-components alongside 3:2/16:10/8:5-display. And all this starts at less than 800€?!  *insert- I'LL-TAKE-YOUR-ENTIRE-STOCK-JonTron-clip-here* --- On a side-note, I seems like influence of this video made computer-configuration-page of Framework Computer Inc crash: The message I keep getting is "We're sorry, but something went wrong", even though in my opinion everything seemed to be just right. ---  (( Also, yeah, I am fully aware someone might have already made this exact-comment I have. But there is 6796-comment as of posting this, and the "infinite scroll" as opposed to "paginated"-comment section makes reading through all those comment pretty much impossible. )) ---
linus: i use a wired mouse also linus: questions life decisions
Well I’m sold. Once my XPS dies in how ever many short years, I’m headed straight to Framework
Just want to buy this product because it will keep them alive. Hopefully its shipping and support is global. All in all, a product worth buying over any mainstream companies who use customer loyalty as a cover for exploiting right to repair (or lack thereof).
Actually makes me excited to see if more modular/ easy access/ easy repairable products in the future
Shame about the subpar cpu choice. One would think amd would be the go to choice... guess not this time
This is almost perfect. The only part that I would wish for...is for it to have a 15" screen and touchscreen capabilities
lego computer
This is great
It's beautiful.
looks like the framework website is kinda borked if you try to configure one. wonder if it's all the traffic from this video lol
OMG, it's the perfect laptop!
You were talking about having a MagSafe similar charger on this, could you use a Volta magnetic cable instead?
Hmm I think Linus is way too excited about the fact that you can change what ports a laptop has, video was blearly titled to make it look like you could upgrade the cpu and gpu.
There are still good companies in the world? Heresy I say.
I was not expecting that. Impressive.
(For Sale) Human Kidney, Lightly Used $1400 OBO - will trade for framework laptop
Yeah, thats amazing! I wish more companies would adopt this approach! I will 100% be looking at these for my next laptop so I hope its successful and they are still around
I really hope they don't die. This is amazing and I don't even like laptops
Last time I opened a laptop like that I had to rip it apart because it was glued together
Cool as a proof of concept but it's pretty stupid.
i never been this hype about a laptop
Did you notice? You just built a laptop!
I was going to hold out for a ryzen laptop with usb 4, but.... I'm very tempted.
I might buy this
*happy Louis Rossmann noises*
They should make the basic motherboards so that they themselves can be configured with AMD, Intel, and ARM CPUs with different levels of ram compatibility, fan types, CPU speeds, connection speeds, and so on. The motherboard is where it all starts. And there are a million different ways to configure them. Framwork could have pages and pages of just basic mobo's, and everything else from there on up that connects to it.
I can actually buy this thing...not only upgrade it...but potentially fix it on my own at minimal personal cost?? That's I'mpossible. I'm looking at a unicorn.
Best thing I ever saw!
hackers be like: oh easy to steal storage drives! swiggity swooty i'm a going to steal your unencrypted storage drives then steal your identity and also sell your identity to the dark web too! big computer companies that want porper security be like: dude if your storage drive is not hardwired into the motherboard then a thief hired by hackers will steal your data! we don't make your computers unable to repaired beascue we like that way! it's actually  bescue we got sick of our customers private  data getting Physically  stolen by hacker computer chops shops! your easy to repair computers are not secure at all! especially  if a hacker with a basic computer hardware knowledge  can just take your hard drive and then  just connect it to there work station then they brute force your password then they get all your data off of it and sell it on the dark web!
Seeing Linus's cracked made me feel something 🥲
ok where is frameworks stock, im investing now 😅
I think LTT crashed their website. I was configuring one for fun and it wouldn't let me :(  I would sell my Gen 1 Windows Surface laptop for one of these bad boys.
This is exciting! More laptops like this please :)
Everyone liked this
Lol, Linus broke their website👍
Soooo nice!
you crashed their website, way to go linus <3
I would totally buy myself one of these if I needed a laptop right now.
reminds me of the modular phone that got axed by the industry for being better than available "premium" products
Linus did not bring up dedicated gpu
The descriptive font acly start because physician collaterally shrug failing a frantic objective. judicious, beautiful hail
So much of this laptop should be obvious, headphone jack, shutoff switches, not soldering things that don't need to be soldered, why isn't this industry standard?
Its nice well im waiting to buy it for about 150-200$ like my thinkpad x250 if it will still exist ;_;
I'm a simple man. you say: fingerprint scanner has linux drivers, I click like
17:35 Linus may have just sold me on this thing unironically framework needs to get on this
Let's All Buy One!!!
would like one with a higher end display. They need to fix the site before my impulse to buy goes away
Price?
is this only for US/Canada?
This thing is making Linus as giddy as Doug DeMuro reviewing an extra-quirky car..  That's tha mark of Quality :D
Modular laptops aren't something new. In fact I've seen super cool modular laptops from different brands like Asus, Dell, HP and Fujitsu to name a few. For example I've seen a laptop where you can choose between a discrete GPU or a battery. I've recently discovered that my old Fujitsu P771 has a freaking projector module that can be inserted in the place of the second battery/DVD bay. Although you can change basically every part of these laptops, the problem stays the same over the years. We need a standard for modular laptop parts. Currently I can't upgrade almost anything of my good old modular laptop. They don't offer higher capacity batteries, better CPU for this slot, even the projector is more like a collectable. The parts I've managed to upgrade are the RAM from 8 to 16GB and also the storage with 1TB SSD (I don't need more for now). I still use it and I love it, but the modularity is a matter of support. If we have some standard, then we can relay on third party modules. That's why USB is so important and popular way to add hardware to your computer. I guess USB killed PCMCIA and now days nobody wants anything else.
Finally, a new thinkpad that’s actually a thinkpad!
Finally... a company with end-user and environment in mind!
Gaming version with modular GPU and high refresh screen options please
No ethernet module yet  :(  Id be sold if they had one.
thanks for the magnetic charging idea linus!
All right! That is awesome!
cleo much?
I don't need a laptop, but I might just buy one for my parents now, just because.......
Ryzen chips and I'll buy one.
I hope the audience of enthusiasts for this specific thing and maybe some professionals who will need to change I/O on a regular basis and do not like dongles would be enough to make them profitable.  I can't imagine someone I know buying a laptop, using it for several years (which most laptops support), then when it's time to shake things up or have something different, it's time for a new laptop anyways.  and the main problem with laptops getting old is processors!  these can't be replaced anyways.
It has the best webcam that I've seen in a long time
This is actually something I want
This is dope! Now let's hope that they release a gaming version that has swappable laptop graphics cards/motherboards.
0:41 You didn't buy it Linus, you *Sold it.*
If I ever need a laptop I'm buying one of these!
The camera on this laptop is better than the one on an MBP, wtf, apple?
the internalls remind me of my cheapo laptop.... but i deffinetly want this laptop lol  edit: i think this have something to do with the fact that older laptops were way more upgradable/ repairable
finally good videos are coming back
This is definitely a step in the right direction. It'd be great if this trend continues, and expands, with manufacturers designing components to standard sizes, in pretty much the same way that phone chargers went. I mean, you could buy the bare laptop, then buy more components down the line as you can afford them, or when better tech comes out, like Bluetooth 6.0, or a 4k screen, or whatever. And if the laptop dies you can just buy the bare kit again and swap your accessories over to it. Bring that shit on, please..
Seems like the configuration portion of the framework website was restricted. I am getting redirected to the same page I am while trying to access the configuration. From the error messages seems like intentional, access to the S3 bucket is restricted by CORS policy.
I really hope this company sticks around, I definitely want to buy one when I go to school and need a laptop
14:15  🤬
Dont need a portable worktop just yet but when they begin to ship to the UK then I'm getting two :)
Oh shit, might get this as a college laptop
Their website crashed xD
Tried to go buy one but their site is completely broken. Can’t sign in, can’t load a the product pages, buttons and links are broken…
Can this succeed, please?
Can you charge it without a Type-C card?
They don't ship to my region yet which is just as well because I can't afford it at the moment. I super appreciate them explaining all the details of the different components right on the page tho, that's really cool for someone who doesn't have time to keep up with the latest tech
this is what happens when you take out the bean counters and in the engineers
NICE.  (Hug of death today, but I'll be back tomorrow.)
The problem with modularity is that a lot of the time it makes more sense to just have most your IO and extra memory/storage slots then have modules. Modules shouldn't take up things you would have anyways.
This laptop is so good and not only that IT MAKES GIGGER COMPANIES LOOK BAD
I like this!
Dell's support assistant is a click all and go.  I use it all the time at work.
Feel like I want to buy one PURELY to support this kind of thinking going forward, I LOVE it
So are they going to sell motherboards with newer processors over time if you want to upgrade your laptop ? Will you be able to return the previous motherboard (functional of course) as part of the payment when you go to upgrade?  It's a shame that PGA CPUs aren't being produced for notebooks anymore, i remember when I change the athlon 64 TF-20 of my notebook by an amd turion 64 x2 tl-60, it was an incredible upgrade.
I'm keeping my eyes on this laptop, I'm interested!
What if they put the custom AMD APU from Steam Deck?...  and turn it into a gaming laptop?🤔
I wish the USB c addin had 2 ports instead of just 1. Other than that, looks great.
I recently went to Best Buy to purchase a new laptop. I was told by the store manager that Microcenter was not considered a direct competitor but Tiger Direct is. I was so confused. I ended up purchasing from Microcenter after I left the store.
Make it happen
I honestly hope these guys don't get eaten by the big guns as usual.. All good guys get beaten.. Please continue to exist!!!
I was holding out for an M2 MacBook air but honestly I think I'm sold on this as a replacement for my XPS13.
17:53 What the fuck are you sitting next to
Why not try framework expansion in Mac with usb c
there website does not work
I’m sold! The pure research they obviously put into creating this shows how they actually care about the customer, and the end user experience. I’m actually in the market for a new laptop. This is exactly what I will purchase.
I have no use for a laptop cause I always use my pc and don't see a scenario where I would use a laptop, but damn I would be lying if I this review almost got me to buy one.   Wish this company all the best in the future!
lol so many people are checking out framework that the website is crashing
this is cringe
Just want to say; yes there are replaceable CPUs, you can do that on the Thinkpad x430.
I think linus ddos'd them...
let's just say my next laptop is gonna be a framework if they are still around in 2-3 years. here goes hoping.
I hope that this thing is not another windows mobile or some kind of project ara or area 51. Profitability in my opinion is still in question because any body can make an upgrades for this. Why I would buy them from Frame, except my willingness to support them. Still a cool product, hope that community will support them. Witeing for a longterm reviews from Linus.
I think their website is dying with orders because I can't get into the system configurator to see all the options.
My ankle monitor has an magnetic charger on it.
These guys are putting all other laptop mnfrs to shame.
This definitely has me sold, once they ship to my country, I'll be buying one for sure.
That's what all Notebooks/Laptops should be.  Unfortunately that's not how our market works.
It's lovely but I wouldn't want a future laptop selection to be a mess(combo of this & that) like desktop PC. And then get bottlenecks out of nowhere.  But repairability is a needful point. Yeah a proper value repairability, not the one with random high cost.
this is how laptops should be, fantastic. All the other laptops should be ashamed.
This is sooo cool. If they're still around, when I need my next laptop, I'll order one
As hp technician, they aren’t harder to repair.
Of course the site is down now... :/
Guys, Dell is not that different from the Framework. They keeps sending partly assembled products to our company all the time, it's like building the Raspberry laptops on every single delivery. But seriously, I love this thing, really hope that they are going to expand to Europe and Dell is such a shit, almost 50% of all brand new devices need service right after unboxing.
Linus on behalf of everyone . I'd first like to thank you for reviewing this . And second why on earth did you not absolutely SELL THE CRAP out of this product !
Make an update video when they roll out more specs please!
This is the coolest product I've seen in a while
Was expecting to see you cover their product sooner
16:20 YO THAT IS A FANTASTIC IDEA I'm legit going to consider buying this, it looks fantastic Starting at $749 and $999?? That's not bad for what you can get out of it! The screen was the first thing that sounded great, and everything else adding onto it sounds really neat. I hope that these kinds of laptops become more standard and this brand becomes more popular. I may not be able to purchase right now, but I'm signing up for an account and joining the newsletter thingies they have, hopefully that'll help in one metric
Wish all companies weren’t selfish and did this for all their consumers.
what about graphic card ?
What’s the point of these I/O modules if they’re just some glorified dongles?
I think I'm gonna buy one tomorrow!
I feel him on the phone charger. The misses steals mine all the time claiming it's hers.
now we just need one with gaming/working intensifies gpu in it like RTX 3060/RX 6600 or somthing like that :-)
Omg, this is exactly what I've been looking for in a laptop! I wonder if they'll release something for Alderlake
If they build a cost effective surface clone I’d buy it
This people are making the future I want to live in.
thats so fckin cool
Please promote this more! I'd love for this to thrive!
Im technician too... The Laptop of my dream, i hope Framework will be success and sold in my country.
hey does anyone know if the coupon works for someone who lives in Canada, and is it in-store online?
Awesome……..
Nice. More. Please.
There is a lot of traffic on their website right now haha
Damn first time I actually seen linus like a product so much he pre orders it
I am not able to view the customization page and I think that's because of the amount of traffic they have on the website right now. This video is definitely gonna up their sales by a lot!
Love how Linus gets so happy about hardware switches for camera and audio. When my dad's laptop thats so old I can't remember a time when he didn't have it, had hardware switches for WiFi, Bluetooth, camera and microphone. Edit: point being, one step forward two steps back
Does this mean Linux will work well? Cause I want one, but only if Linux works well
I want to buy one but the configurator isnt working right now lol
Happy Louis Rossman noises
Those QR codes on hardware is a thing of beauty to me
A completely upgradeable laptop is a useless laptop. You can’t upgrade the bus, pcie, architecture, mouse pad, display   It will be way too bulky, structurally compromised and frankly, not profitable business
I hope they make it big.
This is the future, replaceable everything including motherboards instead of throwing it away and buying another $1000 one
Framework got s ton of publicity from this, the Canadian site is crashing
Touchscreen laptops are stupid...please FFS, kill this trend...if you want a touchscreen, buy a tablet...nobody wants a smudged up laptop screen
i now want this as it can come with 64 gb of ddr4 ram and my current laptop has 2gb of ddr3 ram
I'm thinking of buying a laptop in a near future, so I will get one of these. I already had experience in disassembling laptops (majority of them was HP) and it's a nightmare.
loop the first 1 to 2 seconds of the video while listening to Bad Habits - Ed Sheeran~ Dance it Linus!
I think that so many people are interested that the website crashed lol
Known about this for a while, but for me….. no DGPU no Buy…… also would like 6 port option instead of 4, thinking if they changed the design with the battery up the middle and the CPU half on the left, a DGPU half on the right, each bird having 3 USB 4 ports….. would get instantly
That’s illegal!
This laptop is so good, their website is down
And remember folks: Speak with your wallet!
Has Linus been working out? I don't remember him being so.... muscles.
This is the first time in years I've smiled over any modern/upcoming tech products. This is great! Hopefully, every company on earth follows suit.
Guess what my next laptop is
11:34 - u okay there linus ? We dont want our favourite techtuber to catch corona know do we ?
Shut up and take my money.. Dont need but will buy anyway.
That's the first laptop in ages that's peaked my interest.  Pity their not available on my side of the Atlantic yet.... If also want an OLED upgrade.
Why go third party when i can get all the mods first party.      Next laptop no doubt
Please stop holding it one handed and flexing the screen!  I’m so nervous watching you because of your affinity for dropping expensive software.
Also fun activity for dads to teach their kids tech if they are interested... Imagine this in a KiwiCo crate
This is amazing I love it there’s just so much flexibility and so much potential and if your HDMI or display port or something breaks or stops working you can just replace it and I can see 3rd party creators making new keyboards and screens specifically for this laptop. Amazing 👍
Where the see-thru keyboard has letters written on it.??????
Feeding the algorithm with like/sub/bell and comment.  PSA: make a hotkey to help👌
Oh god, please tell me this will be available with other than US keyboard layouts. Please!  The main issue: marketing and getting "out there", this will fail, because ppl wont buy it as they dont know about it.
Trying their website... On mobile Android it is having problems in the DIY selection screen
where is thunderbolt so you can plug an external GPU in?
A computer hardware business actually caring about the consumer? Impossible.
Where do I have to sign to sell my soul and body to Framework?
I think Linus killed their website
I can’t afford the laptop but I love it.
Best. Laptop. Ever. Slap Linux on it, and you have the perfect device. Especially if they add touch support (maybe pencil too) Their whole business model just resonates with me
Put a GPU on it
Just what we needed a modular laptop
Give whoever did that edit it the keyboard part a raise please, it really caught me off guard 😂
Kind of amusing to talk about the direct-to-consumer business model in a video sponsored by a retailer, lol.
This is amazing, I REALLY hope this takes off!!
Tried to look at buying one, seems their hosting is having issues with how many requests are hitting their site...
Holy shit this is awesome
Thank you linus, I now know what is my next laptop.
seems like their website is broken; when i try to click on the configure button it goes to an 'oops something went wrong' page. Doesn't look like they ship to new zealand either which is sad.
I've been waiting months for your video on this. Probably be my next laptop just because I love what they are doing.
He broke the website
This might be my favourite and most satisfying LTT video I’ve ever seen
Is the GPU upgradeable? Or is this more like home office laptop? Super cool that Framework is trying to make a statement of consumer-minded approach again
11:53 cracked me up hard😂 And also what an cool device! If they manage to keep the motherboard's form factor for other CPUs they could even just sell the CPU+Motherboard, so if you want to upgrade you could just buy that and keep everything else from the old one to save money and resources.
This sounds awesome even more of u can power it on the left or right depending on where in the house I am I need to charge from one side or the other
Apple and Microsoft should be taking notes
Can you use the USB HDD Like a USB C Stick in other PCs?
Good videos keep it up bro😃👍👍
That is a damn interesting laptop
is anyone else getting a error padge for the framwork link?
Is it possible to buy shares in this company? :)
That webcam looks better than my dji drone piece of shiettt
If I hadn't bought an SP7 (opposite end of the repairability scale I know), I would buy one of these for my laptop
there so much FREEDOM in choosing what you want in your product i fucking love that.
FINALLY! Can we take out the speakers and put something actually useful there!??
I’m getting one of these once as soon as I can afford it.
Linus kinda just, broke for a good second and a half
Can't wait to see where this goes in a couple of years, I'm definitely getting one
Awesome
1:45 - the one item linus manages to not drop happens to be 1000% repairable. Sus dont u think 😂😂😂
You have to buy it for them to grow/succeed and for other companies to notice. This should be more important than the specs. This genuinely feels like a product which carries the idea so fully, if it dies the idea was never very popular to begin with.
Love the keyboard. The Dell Elite my employer is forcing me to use has that horrible stick mouse in the keyboard. Of course, they expect me to use a docking station. But the only gave me one, so office or home or buy another one myself. I did the latter.
Now frameworks website is down, looks like they are getting alot more business lol.
👍😎
If they could just put one more module slot on there, that uses pcie that would be so fucking cool. Also, once people start designing random modules it's probably gonna be awesome, so I hope you will come back to this one day..
This is amazing I only wish they would be able to come out with one that has a 360 hinge for the screen with pen support  But until that day comes I will stick with my Asus flow x13
LOL their site is absolutely swamped.
Ok. I’m in love. Gimme a 17inch version and I will never buy anything else!
NO SHIPPING TO AUS?! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! They wont shut up and take my money!
upgradable laptop  **exists**   Linus:  "This does put a smile on my face."  Edit: Just an edit.
So....its like the sexier and thinner Panasonic Toughbook ?
are modular laptops still a far away dream?
16:55 best joke
I found my new computer
Well I'm sold, this is going to be my next laptop
@linus - there is a option (not from framework) In Germany for "magnetic charging", meaning of a small adapter who workfor that - and: you could Change it from Micro-USB to USB-C in secounds, just clip it of and clip it on the new one on. but, i'm not really sure if that could "bring" the power of 60w through it...
Can the motherboard be replaced with a newer model? That'd partially solve the problem with soldered CPUs.  edit: Googled it, and yes you can! It's actually a core principle of the design!
The market provides where legislation has only just taken the first shuffle forward. Classic.
This is the MOST excited I've been for a laptop in a long time.
Man, I just bought a laptop not too long ago. My next one will definitely be one of these, if they are still around.
Standardized modular mobile GPU please?
Nop, battery disconnect is like for Thinkpad one, to disconnect it before servicing, when you plug the charger in, it re-enabled the battery 😉😁 (At least I guess so)
Their website seems to be a bit on the broken side and needs some work.
i hate when companies say "launches in summer" "launches in fall" IDK WHEN UR SUMMER IS, I GOT SUMMER RN, JUST TELL ME THE MONTHS U GONNA LAUNCH IT IN
I'll be game once they make a nice gaming laptop.
Upgrade all you want...the fans will eventually dust up and stop working.
I've always felt that it was an utter failure of design philosophy when something can't be fixed or worked on by a person who owns the damn thing. No matter what it is.
Man this really needs to grow and stay alive as long as passable. Next Laptop is going to be a framework one
Can't wait for Louis Rossmann to react to this.
i'm really praying for a non-oneplus repeat down the road here and that they work better than a fairphone..
PLease let me have a module with gpio pins, maybe adc, i2c,spi. A programable atmega or esp32 module, just some connectors to attach my sensors. connect adafruit feather? let's build a ton of extension modules to make this thing have a future. rs232 without dongle?  jtag module, ... so many possibilities.
This laptop looks freaking sick!
Ah yes, don't put in a paper manual at all and just have QR codes than can lead to a 404 at any moment. Genius
Someone will try to make it very powerful
I tried to fix an old hp a while ago. It is nearly impossible to disassemble it without ripping the power button cable off the pcb. Guess how I learned this.
Wait does this support thunderbolt 3 or 4?
must be nice to buy a laptop just cuz its nice, meanwhile he has more stock of laptops in the store room than Dell has xD
Now this is a cool laptop, I wish that everything like this.
Love this Love this Love this
Framework's finessing the game and I love it.
I am watching this video again, this with Linux might be a very interesting prospect.
> Open AF system > Can easily replace anything > Gives you detailed instructions on how to do it > Uses Windows  m8
dude if they have a gpu adapter that I can just stick like a 2080 into the motherboard similar to that of that mobile razer box Im paying triple plus shipping for it
I wonder if my link from a week agon did the trick to this video 😁😁
So what CAN go into those 4 side modules slots, apart from SSD or various USB/TB/video connectivity?
I guess the viewers are unwittingly DDoSing their website, I can't access the configurator, I keep getting error 500 :P
Coolest laptop ever!!!!
this is very cool
The moment when you see: We haven’t opened ordering in your region yet, but we’re looking forward to getting there!
finally, upgradability without having all of my friends laugh at me for having a fatty fatty obese laptop
I'll definitely check them out to see if they have options that I can use. Though the fingerprint scanner he mentioned better be optional.
I can't even configure a laptop, the website service broke
this is so incredible, if I didn't have a perfectly functional laptop, I would've bought one right now
The only 2 thing missing for me to buy one are touchscreen and dedicated graphics option. Otherwise, i would order one right now.
I like how there is no warning spelled out in bright yellow with no touch sign on the heatsink instead just a hot warning image, take away the warning labels and let the stupid people sort themselves out
Very good . But what about the price of upgrade stuff.  How much it cost
Pls review Tesla model s plaid
11:56 *linusjak*
Gaming laptop time?
This has to be supported for longer than 3 years for it to be viable. If they drop this product line in any less time its ewaste.
Looks like a good investment! I'm in.
I would 100% buy a amd one if they had it
Yo bros i noticed you don't have any videos specifically regarding recommendations on what webcams are good/worth looking at. Maybe they are pretty much the same depending on price range but still, i'd watch it and it's some easy views!
Wow that webcam is impressive
I thought you were paid for those segways....
At last the real laptops.  Thank you framework.  With this kind of DIY and customization, I bet there will be a lot of people happy with your laptop.   I just hope they can produce enough product. Damn! Now I have reason to move from the Apple ecossystem.
That's actually crazy cool
Thank you for doing this videos, they not only help this companies, it also help us not to sell a keadnee for a pc😄
why can i doble like this
11:52 Thank you editor.
This is awesome. I wanted this 10 years ago when I was going through college.
Third time today that I hear someone say "jazzed" in a video. Must be the word of the day or something. The laptop is totally worth being jazzed about though.
About time so many times I have had a good laptop that I would have LOVED To keep if I could have upgraded.  Very cool.
Even if it's performance isn't quite as good as non-repairable flagship laptops, I'm still TOTALLY buying this for it's philosophy and, hopefully, savings down the track, when I can just repair something instead of throwing the whole laptop out..
I am intrigued
Those BIOS features used to be some of my favorites on ThinkPads. Not sure why they went away, but I love that somebody on this team must have used those features and made sure they made it in.
Really cool. More companies should do this. Why buy a whole new laptop when you can just upgrade the parts you need
Awesome to see Linus supporting such companies. In the end we all win as end-users.
THE DELL'S NOT EVEN F%*KING THINNER!!!
This reminds me of my old IBM Laptop which was given to me used by my uncle. Longest lasting piece of tech ever.
Think I know what brand my next laptop will be. Hope they're still around when my 10 year old one becomes useless. Figure I can get another decade out of it before it's too slow.
(A la beastie boys) you got to fight...for your right...to re-pair!
i guess since they lost the war on right to repair they caved or intisapated
This is amazing; I’m sold. I really think they can be profitable too cause laptop manufacturers have stagnated of the past 6 years. Im still using a 2015 Macbook pro cause there just isn’t anything out there significantly better thats worth the $1-2k upgrade. The “gold standard” XPS 15 is a shit laptop (I use one at work). Everything else out there seems to be taking away features every year rather than adding them. Im sure theres improvements that can be made to this like a trackpad and chassis that can compete with Apple, but on every other front they seem to be blowing the competition out of the water
I'm all for a new framework that isn't a new JS framework
This honestly might be the coolest thing I've seen on this channel (and there's been a lot of cool things)!
@The Linux Experiment ! I would love to see you run manjaro kde on this when they ship to France
Damn it people. Stop with the ribbon cables, missed opportunity!  Should have made it pogo pins
FINALLY something *NEW* in the laptop space!
I’m gonna support these guys for sure! Waiting for AMD APU.  😃😃
3 fifteen pst the site is suffering from ltt hug of death
Alex tempted to apply
Id love to support these guys but I would need a gpu module. Like a mxm or something. Honestly even if it was soldered like the cpu to the motherboard
This is perfect! I didn't want to buy a laptop because I have a good pc and it is so much more upgradable than any laptop ever but damn!!! I want to buy this one the only problem for the moment is that there's no AMD RYZEN choice for the cpu /apu.  Please Framework make this happen.
Motherboard upgrade while everything else is still in good condition. Or even replacement. Just like that.
Damned, my dell XPS 15 9570 is still too new. But if I needed a new laptop, I'll go for this one! I hate how the "right to repair" freedom is being taken away from me. When my laptop fails , frame.work will be on top of my list!!!!!!!!!!!!!
please true tech god!! don't let big business, buy this company, to pretend there truly care, about there customers, of self the company to get rid of something better. Cough Cough Telsa
even better than the magnetic charging module idea, wireless charging module  i want to know if this thing can handle a valve index, and if not, when/if they'll ever have options that can handle it
Whilst I laud the principle, you _will_ be paying for the privilege of repairing/modifying your own laptop.   The current model _starts_ at $999 and details are vague to non-existent on the website.
13:21 "touch support is built into the motherboard" pardon me, sir?
You see companies can profit just from custom parts like games with skin and stuffs , here parts .
You assemble it yourself? So it's an IKEA laptop 😉
At 9:24 I see a white arrow pointing where whe black wire is connected and a black arrow where the white cable is connected. Linus, did you screwed up something meant to be so simple for the average consumer?
Tried to configure 1 to purchase, i would assume the community already killing the page
Yooo i lost my gpu
Modular IO, aka usb adapters
I would love to have bought a new laptop fairly recently after the crappy windows 8. but I am happy with my laptop from 2007, at the time it was slow as anything apart from my pc's at the time, so not used too often, but allows me to use it while on holiday or something, while amount of memory limited to 5 or 6 gig due to bios, I put a fast speed cheap ssd in it, upgraded the memory, and great to use on the move. I don't need super sonic, or flashy non-upgradable path, all I want it to do is go online, check e-mails, maybe play an old game, transfere video footage from a dashcam, and watch youtube videos, but seeing this review, then I could finally be persuaded if the price is right here in the UK.
That webcam quality is better than most standalone webcams
Did it survive the Linus drop testing
I think we broke the site…
they don't need to stay there people will hack this thing and add more stuff
I think Linus might have accidentally ddosed framework
Linus: NONSENSE! If you cannot change the CPU/GPU freely then its NOT upgradable! because 99% of the time we want different CPUs and GUS, as usual you are completely clueless to what normal people actually want or need. PS this is a prototype, it is not a shipping product, I could not even configure one because the website kept throwing errors, once VaporWare Linus!! NOT!!!
2:19 the moment that small gifts really warms your hearts
Give me an 18” screen and I’m sold.
If they have a trackpoint keyboard and mouse buttons on the trackpad...
FINALLY! I’ve been thinking g about how to do this for YEARS and couldn’t come up with a solution. This so frickin elegant. Love it!
That's wicked Awesome!
This company really needs to market this to schools as a viable option to buying new laptops every year for students just to keep up with software requirements.   Even better would a Linux Education install on one of these systems, with remote administration by the teachers.
Remember Project Ara? I hope google would pick up on the project again because I really like the idea of a modular phone.
i want one :D
By mid-way into the video I was sold, but I still missed one thing: if the product is really good and reaches the level of a standard high grade PC, Linus should get one. By the end of the video, I am satisfied. I'll check when the website is online again when I can get mine xD
Remember to take monthly and weekly newsletter, and rss feed.
It's just too bad that there's no AMD option, and no gaming option.  Both of those are dealbreakers for me.
I hope other companies learn form this. This is the future.
This company needs to become the next apple or hp, this is amazing, (i also love the logo)
This thing with linux is the ultimate open source diy laptop. Awesome!
Qpon 🤦‍♂️ it's pronounced coopon
Man I WISH I'd need a Laptop ! This looks awesome, I hope these guys go somewhere and become the new Apple or something, I really do :P
Tell me has a good Linux drivers support. And this will be haven
MSI could learn a thing or two with their "factory seal" stickers on the back of their laptops
Before he even mentioned the QR code’s I could tell the level of passion this team put into making it easy for non tech savvy people to get into it  Labeled every component in bold text. It’s not idiot proof, it’s beginner friendly.
I got emotional at the end, wish I could buy one in Brazil
Me who just bought a laptop
Lol me and my dad just had a conversation about how dumb it is to buy a new laptop because you can't upgrade it 3-5 years later
Alex getting a little fan boyish there. You still gotta be critical about products nothing is perfect and this is kind of a review. One major concern I have is how well these things will stay in over removal's and insertions before the connector is loose. Not all type c connectors last the same amount of time. The one on my phone is going now. Also seems a tad expensive. But if that's the thing ur set on it's nice.
i just wanna comment to show my support. i hope this influences the video to be in more recommended sections
Have Anthony install Linux on it and do a video of his experience using it!
Amazing!  Great for LTT to be demonstrating and encouraging a great product like this!
i need this
I mean, I'm sold. Heck yeah. It's my next laptop. Period.
Upgradable cpu (plus amd or arm options), an actual good touchscreen and you can count me in.  Whom am I kidding. Count me in nonetheless...
Pricey for a 13 inch
Ltt must have sent to much traffic to the site definitely worth a look when it’s sorted out I think
The price is too much sadly
I want to invest but their website does not work
I don't even buy a laptop if I can't change both RAM slots, the M.2 and the battery.  Since I go for 17 inch laptops it's not that hard to find fortunately. Currently my Asus TUF Gaming A17 has 2 replaceable (8cm length) M.2 SSDs and a 2.5inch drive. The WiFi card is also replaceable. I hope it lasts long, it's upgradeable and the R7 4800H should be a decent CPU for at least half a decade.
I fucking love it!!!
I think THIS will be my next laptop. It is awesome.
So far, I am interested in what I have seen. I would say that I am not directly in there target market since I'm shopping for a gaming laptop, but that doesn't mean that they won't ever make me part of their target market. I am impressed, but for know, I will just keep tabs on them.
It’s good to see companies trying to avoid planned obsolescence and E-waste. Apple should take notes instead of taking the easy way out and paying multi-million dollar lawsuits.
Would love to see if they could make a touch 2-in-1 like this. Maybe even swappable hinges so you can choose between fold-back screens or regular. Love all the thoughtful touches and just the desire to build and bring to market a device finally made how it SHOULD be made, showing all the excuses from other manufacturers are just about greed.
as soon as they sell in the EU and any of my family members need a laptop or they're adding a gaming version i will check this out 100%
Finally
This is AWESOME!!
Oh man, why do I am integrated into the Apple-System??
Am I the only one noticing that these upgrade "modules" are just recessed proprietary USB-C dongles?
I love this concept. I'm going to hold off a bit for maybe a AMD version but this is still so amazing.
I just bought a ROG laptop few months ago but I do hope Framework makes a thicker, desktop replacement/gaming laptop style device for me get with a buff GPU, perhaps with separate board containing the GPU to make it somewhat upgradable, now thats a dream I am willing to have.
Wauw this is greate i want one to hope this gets adopted widly.
Why would anyone put off the most important decision they  could ever make in their lives concerning eternal life? If you die today are  you going to heaven? In 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 The apostle Paul tells us what the  gospel is: "Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I  preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also  you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you  believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also  received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that  He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the  Scriptures. Gospel means "good news." Your debt has been paid, the  death penalty has been paid, you are free. Matthew 18:3 - Jesus said:  "Unless you become like this little child you will not enter the kingdom  of heaven." This is how to be saved, it is simply child like, as simple as  ABC: A - Admit that you are a sinner. This is where that godly sorrow leads to  genuine repentance for sinning against a righteous God and there is a change of  heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from  the inside out. Romans 3:10 As it is written: "There is none righteous,  no, not one." Romans 3:23 For all have sinned and fall short of the glory  of God. (We are all born sinners which is why we must be born spiritually in  order to enter the Kingdom of Heaven). Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is  death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. The wages  of sin is death, in other words our sin means that we have been given a death  sentence, we have the death penalty hanging over our heads, that's the bad  news. But here's the good news: the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus  our Lord. Ephesians 2:8-9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith  & this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God, not by works, so that  no one can boast. B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ shed his blood and died on the cross for your  sins, was buried, and that God raised Jesus from the dead. This is trusting  with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. Romans 10:9-10 That  if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your  heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your  heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you  confess and are saved. C - Call upon the name of the Lord. Every single person  who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth  that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of lords and the King of kings. Romans  @ For it is written: "As I live, says the Lord, Every knee shall bow  to Me, And every tongue shall confess to God." Don't wait until later, do  this now. Romans 10:13 For "whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be  saved." "O God, I am a sinner. I'm sorry for my sin. I want to turn  from my sin. I believe Jesus Christ is Your Son; I believe that He died on the  cross for my sin and that He was buried and You raised Him to life. I have  decided to place my faith in Jesus Christ as my Savior, trusting only in His  shed blood as sufficient to save my soul and to take me to heaven. Thank You,  Lord Jesus, for saving me. Amen."
THIS is going to be my next laptop. Really following in the thinkpads footsteps. I hope they go far.
first time I've seen you support a lap top
FYI that free bluetooth headphone is a horrible mono monstrosity even if it's free
I still don’t get it. It’s a laptop with harder to access usb-c ports, how is that better? I wish things were easier to repair, I really do. It’s a pain every time I have to open up a MacBook or iPhone (things I do   regularly). But I just don’t get this design at all.
I have to let this out, this company needs to know that every single money grab brand out there is going to do everything in their power to take this company down !!! BOTH from the outside and the inside.     BE AWARE Framework
Sold, no doubt for me. Other companies must learn from them
What a piece of junk
Would love to watch Anthony's take on this
Consumers dictate the design. Why give them a modular computer when they have to upgrade the whole thing because the CPU spec changed.  Or the memory spec changed. Things the users upgrade ARE upgradable.  Memory chips are often upgradable, and so is hard drive storage even the GPU is upgradable on larger laptops.  But things that cause the user to upgrade the whole computer for cpu, sometimes the gpu, why make them upgradable if the user never upgrades them? CPUs on laptops used to be upgradable. Most users use a laptop until it dies in the original form that they bought it in.  on average that's 5 years.  why waste the money building something that nobody uses.
site isnr working. gonna keep an eye on this from denmark. im all in.
Linus: releases a video Framework: Aaaand you crashed our website
Watching this video was surreal. This is the kind of move that should have been obvious years ago, but this is the first implementation that doesn't seem terrible. Why now?
Bring back the Pismo design
my only complaint is that the battery isn't accessible without taking the bottom off, so you could carry 2. not a thing most people will need to do but it would be nice
Why aren't we funding this? We should fund this! I'm buying one asap
This people are going to be huge for us tech nerds, mark my words.
the pc case from the sponsor looks like those watergames in old taco bells you could try to win a free taco.
I posit that those excuses never held any water.
I would definitely get one of these just to support the company if I didn’t already have my heart set on a different machine.
How convenient... I was just about to get a new laptop...
How would Framework react to hundreds of claims of faulty internal components, because people are clumsy with screwdrivers? Warranty claims might burn them, which would be a big shame.
Ok I am all in with this philosophy, when is this available to buy?
Now if only we could get the entire industry to follow their lead.
this is so cool
This sounds dumb to say - but all it takes is someone doing it correctly. So many have tried and failed because they seem to inevitably have some horrible deal breaker issue. I see no deal breakers here, except the website is completely broken. Hope they get that fixed. As a software engineer, I even entertained the idea of joining them until I discovered they use Ruby on Rails - ewww, sorry guys. I hate Ruby on Rails because it's difficult to work in and diagnose issues - as it appears you may have discovered today lol.  Would be curious what the Linux support is like (specifically, how well supported are the integrated components)
Is good for gaming?
I have been looking to get a new laptop recently, and I think this might have to be it.
Dude. This is insanely amazing. I might just buy one of these.
There is now no good excuse for a laptop to come out in 2021 without being upgradeable and repairable. None.
The framework website appears to be busted?
I laughed at the modulable cellphone because it wasn't. But that...
Now if only their website wasn't broken
Hate Apple Magsafe. just falls out all the time
I had a Clevo laptop many years ago that had an MXM graphics card. I thought that it was cool to be able to upgrade when time comes. Time came and I was disappointed that MXM cards were 1. very hard to find. 2. Super expensive. 3. Only had a minor GPU version upgrade that was as outdated as the one I had.
i'm impatient they start to ship in Europe !
I don't understand of how they managed to make different connectors compatible when switched around because that's really cool. Hopefully they will have other options in the future: eSATA connection?, larger screens available (17''), and AMD processors.  Btw Linus, I also have a wired mouse on the right side of my laptop.
Frame.work is getting the LTT hug of love right now :)
if it had an upgradable GPU I'd buy it as my next laptop 100%  Still, i appreciate their openness and i hope they're successful!
Planet Earth appreciates your work Framework.
I think we crashed frame.work's site... can't configure any options... lol
I've never wanted a laptop over a desktop, and I am in no position to order one of these, but I wish there was a way I could get one purely to signal to the company that this is a total yes move and more importantly wake other companies up to the fact that more consumer-friendly is more better!
Sounds great, hope they will sell it here over in EU.  And hope they make a gamer version with gpu upgradeable.
I IN LOVE
It seems this video is already causing overload problems on their site. I hope these laptops can live up to the hype.
Anyone else dreamed of the price being below 2k$ while watching the video, only to realize that it's priced very reasonably? I was MINDBLOWN. If this company will be still around once I need a new laptop, this is where i'll empty my piggy bank.
Wish I was in the market for a laptop because I want to give these guys money
Ok I want one. This is amazing.
"sexy thin"? it's just like a fairphone. If it wasn't modular fancy repairable, it would just be a boring mediocre cheap laptop. It's still a cool concept though
Just another awesome modular product by a company that won't last the year becasue manufactures don't like competition like that. We don't live in a world moral enough for this laptop.
at last one laptop of my dreams
You can repair a macbook, don't listen to everything companys tell you
Not gonna work.  What happens when USB 4 comes out. New PCI express ? Or new processors come out?
Can we give a Award for the Best Produkt of the Year ! I LOVE IT !!!  THX
If this had just one Thunderbolt 3/4 port I'd buy one immediately on principle. I don't even need a new laptop.
This is awesome.
I hope this video skyrockets to me moon :') it is just beautiful
Im just going to buy one to support them
How is this laptop real???
I am absolutely in love with this!!!! :D really do!
If they offered an AMD Ryzen processor, I would buy it. I am no fan of team blue.
this should be the future for phones too
My idiot hands indeed. Only David will truly understand.
Apple: "We're buying Framework company just to shut it down. Repairable and upgradable devices? Is madness".
Shitting on dell never gets old.
These guys could really garner a good stranglehold on the business laptop game with these machines. If they can manage to create modular docking stations that unlike the shitty dell thunderbolt ones that don't die in like a couple months. The sheer potential with those slots for a business to tailor their laptops to have the required specs for everyone in the company.
This is the future. now we wait for others for competition, and then tablet versions.
The only complaint I have so far is that it's Intel. Otherwise that's gorgeous.
Okay, It has been ...how long?? 16 years since I've purchased a laptop. I am totally sold !!  I don't just want to buy, wish if I had enough money to actually give these guys a boost because they actually deserve it.
Dell lost alot of customers when they scammed people with the false Alienware area 51m upgradibility promise.
Auch. Seeing Adam Savage's tested did a vid on this months ago. 🦀
one-usb-c-cable-egpu here i come
They don't even have to because type c magnetic charges already exist
I'm sold. Shame that I don't need a new laptop right now. But in the future I know where to find it
But can it game?
Dell have an unattended installer, dcucli which we integrate into the task sequence for a lite touch build and can be invoked from the command line.
I mainly use my PC and don't really need a laptop, but even I am tempted to buy one
I can assure you, I have been following right to repair for years. I have tears in my eyes. :')
Activate windoss
I'm not kidding when I say I learned about this product two days ago and I wanted to buy it BEFORE this video.
Meanwhile someone at Dell: Let’s put 8GBx2 on a laptop that supports 32Gb max memory!
This! we need more of it ! lol
If they start offering non-intel CPUs, I'll buy one.
It's been a while since I've seen Linus this excited. This is _definitely_ something to pay attention to.
F yeah going to buy one of these. Bite my apple apple
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
This might be really interesting, hope they stick around... Also... Every time Linus says "coupon" I remember Medison going on about how it is not "q-u-p-i-o-n" 😂😂😂😂
Never underestimate the passion and dedication of a formerly retired engineer. Kinda wish I didn't own a laptop right now.
Order page is down. Bet Linus video had something to do with it 😉. Will try later since I want to support this company.
To me it does not bode well for this company that they cannot even keep an ordering site up. I was going to order one but, I have changed my mind. Poor web site means other issues, like piss poor planning on their part. They may know how to design a notebook, but they cannot get the selling side down so who knows what else will suck?
I know the upgradability is really cool, but I don’t know how you could trust non-OEM parts to install. Seems like a security nightmare to me.
Something I have been waiting for! I'm ordering 2 the minute they open up orders in the EU.
So it's a thin and light notebook with a respectable selection of features, upgradeable and swapable parts for fitting the best situations and for repairs, isn't out of the mass manufacturing market's price point, AND I can save a significant amount of money by assembling it myself? This is amazing!
You broke the website. A good start.
Need a GPU model and I am the first one to buy it
TLTW: Ex-engineers makes company to give their former companies the biggest middle finger in marketing: Making a legit good product that debunks all excuses from them. NOICE!  Thin an modular, never expected to see the day so soon.
immediatly went to the website.  extremely disappointing the website a little broken
mr rossman is nutting
is the screen upgradable ?    Let's say I want a brighter screen ,  or a more color accurate screen ?
No gpu.... 😭😭😭😭
ill save them for the future... man  those guys deserve this spotlight
My next laptop will definitely be a Framework!
I've been looking for a new laptop. I was going to go with a slightly used ThinkPad, but I think this is where I'll spend my money now.
HOLY SHIT FUCKING FULL SIZE DISPLAY PORT ON A LAPTOP AND FINGERPRINT DRIVER THAT WORKS IN LINUX TAKE MY MONEY
I love that this video has crashed their website. Literally unresponsive.
Perfect laptop when paired with external video card.
Is it possible to have this connected to an eGPU? Say for an RTX 30 series GPU? Thanks!
Just give me an RJ45 module and I'm sold. Give me AMD options and I'm replacing every laptop in company...
Still keeping my qosmio x775 alive lol. That thing is so old the GPU and CPU are socketed! Wish we could bace that in 2021
I wish I would have saw this before I got my hp pavilion
So the microSD card module supports UFS cards too. V. Cool.
It just needs more keyboard, more trackpoint, less touchpad...
17:25  Wait so it doesn't have windows 10 preinstalled?
Am I the only one who thinks that the bottom panel of the laptop looks very similar to ThinkPads?
But can you get one with an internal CD-RW drive?
Cpu is soldered on a laptop whose selling point is modularity!
I thought I hated laptops, but apparently I just hate laptops that force me to make compromises.
If Linus was nice to the product, that means it REALLY is good.
WE NEED MORE PRODUCTS LIKE THIS!!!
We need more products like these across all industries!
"Storage expansion cards" you mean pendrives?
They need AMD processors.
good laptop
When engineers get the final say in product development...
cmon, how much did they pay u
Well, I'm sold
this is amazing
The salty lunge culturally bake because religion conceptually turn per a moldy sociology. awful, sour single
These look awesome. I don't think I've shared the same level of enthusiasm from a product that Linus has before (looking at you Intel :) ). I just don't get why nobody else has done this? The whole CAD stuff for your motherboard is just an example of the kind of touch that just makes you think wow.
This is what the world really need!
Wanted to order right away. Configurator is down.  LTT ddos’d the site through customer influx.
This laptop has been sent from heaven
i love this
I am sold. Relatively affordable, modular, parts readily available and so much more.  I realllllllyyy hope they have an upgrade path for the motherboard/CPU in the future. Id like to keep this thing for when 6 core 12 thread CPUs on laptops are the norm.
Nice Idea, but I want an option with a GPU, as I want to game a bit on my laptop. Also nice to have´s would be Ethernet, more ports (3 are pretty much the lower limit IMHO), and a F*ING KEYBOARD WITH FULL SIZED ARROW KEYS FFS :(
Make a 17 inch model with a gpu and I'm sold
if only it supported MXMs
Shame I already ordered a laptop, the second this has touch I will be claiming it for my next laptop.
The 3:2 aspect ration for the screen is a deal breaker for me.   I'd also like to see a 15" screen size with AMD Ryzen processor options.   I am sure linux would be no issue to run on this laptop since it is using relatively standard and quality components.
If this company succeeds, well... I'm fucking investing
Who the heck uses DisplayPort?
If they end up supporting ryzen products as well in the future, I will definitely grab one of these!
999$ still expensive for me  But for god damn sake this is what pc builder wants for there laptop
What about the GPU, for me that is a deal breaker if you can't change it
I really hope this takes off so that dell and HP try to hop on the hype train
il liking the idea but I'd rather wait for the second gen one or something with thunderbolt or a more gaming orientate
Pretty sure they also have some sort of online market for users to swap parts with each other.
Yup had a hobby rc radio module, that the ipex4 (uf.l) connector had come apart on, so had to solder the signal wire to the center pin, and the shielding to one of the ground pads.  DON'T MESS WITH UF.L CONNECTORS!!!
If this company doesn't get greedy or stupid this could be the future.  Fingers crossed.
T
I like the idea of modular laptops, you can buy the base model super cheap with just the core component, and then just buy the modules you need for what you do, rather than paying for a whole bunch of functionality that you'll never use, and fewer things to go wrong, and if one of the modules dies, you can replace it without needing to replace the whole laptop.  and now that computers aren't really getting that much faster every generation, it can last a while.
Omg this is extremely cool! I have just bought a laptop but if i hadn’t had this would have really been a solid competitor
Losing your edge Linus. Been upgradable laptops for decades - see Sager / Clevo
That's one way to embarrass multi-million-dollar companies...
Most ultrbooks have soildered ram these days.   The one port I want they still don't make. That's full size SD   You've been sponsored by those magnetic charging cables before, so those are an option.
I feel like Linus lives for these segues to the sponsorships.  I'm watching and the man just comes alive each time he gets to announce who's paying him next.
I will take this, but in the AMD flavor
Linnus ""refhonolohy" Sébastien
Don't know why this reminded me of this but my human to computer interface module broke in my wife's car..the car dealer told me theirs 83 computers in her car long story short don't spill stuff in the corner of your trunk
Very, very cool.
you can get 100W compatible usb c magnetic cables from aliexpress (made by baseus btw) that works exactly as you want. if I didn't lose the little magnetic usbc plug I would still use it.
I'd love to get one of these, but I've just purchased a laptop to replace my old one that battery swelled.
Ok, my next laptop sold.
Gimi
As an Electronic engineer, the more connectors in a system, the more points of failure and thus more unreliable. I like the idea of replaceability and repairability but I'd be interested to see how long this lasts.....
I still use wired mice and keyboards because My PC is in another room.
-Shame there isn't an option to buy it without an OS.- Edit: the DIY edition where you assemble the whole thing yourself doesn't have an OS, perfection. I'm sold.
This is cool. But not allowing for repairability never had anything to do with how capable laptop companies are and everything to do with the bottom line. Designing a laptop to be easily repairable is invariably going to be more difficult, and include more parts to produce, adding to cost. Consumers didn't consider upgradability and maintenence as an important part of their shopping priorities. Laptops that aren't repairable and upgradeable need to be replaced more often. For all these reasons, laptop companies do not become more profitable by making them repairable or upgradeable. So they don't.
Damn I wonder if Linus warned them that they would get many orders after making this video.
Glad I got my order in before Linus broke their website LOL
The user experience feels like it's the IKEA of portables.  The idea of upgradable is great. However, don't they still own the end to end process via the ecosystem they've created? You're still tied in to them for the upgrade paths. We can only dream of full standards compliance...
Meme material right there... 11:27
I'm afraid we crashed Framework's site.
I hope they have enough success to do a fatter, gaming/workstation oriented modular machine with thunderbolt options and GPU upgrades........hell, even if it required a full mobo swap for soldered CPU/GPU combos. I'd be in.
This looks perfect, with 32 or 64 GB of RAM it can run some containers or VMs, looks great for my Linux usage
This looks awesome. I know I'll have access to the ports I need and I can repair it easily. Might actually get one
The framework's website it's down lol everyone wants one
I'm getting 500 errors on their website. It's your fault! :D
remember when phones tried. and flopped.
I reeaaallly want this laptop
I will be sure to recommend their laptops to everyone. I'm sure my next will be one of theirs, assuming they last long enough.
You killed their website.  :)  "500 Internal Server Error If you are the administrator of this website, then please read this web application's log file and/or the web server's log file to find out what went wrong."
Linus's phone is beat
Fuck I’m sold too, the dream is real!… if it wasn’t I just bought my new laptop but I’m keeping this brand for the future and I’m recomending the fuck out of it to EVERYONE! One thing though, site configurator is down now, do they at least have different language layout keyboards. For something this customizable it’s MANDATORY!
I mean if they apply this sort of quality and philosophy to a big chonker gaming laptop that use standard consumer socketable CPUs on a regular basis this could really be something of a major game changer. Heck, in this age of external GPUs that can be plugged into and theoretically swapped out for gaming laptops you could even use an internalized version of that sort of design allowing full customization more or less on par with DIY PCs. So the potential really is there if they continue to grow and expand on the concept. I am sure as heck here for it.
"wait UUHHhhhuuhhHhhh"
Technically someone could make a GPU expansion if they really wanted to. I am genius.
interesting and wonderful product sure, but I wouldn't trust a techbro channel and channel and community for aesthetics.
People we've finally found a laptop Louis Rossmann will approve...
I can see the SFF community having a field day with the motherboard/CPU combo in a super tiny PC build. Very very cool.
This is huge ! They need to create a gaming laptop ASAP. Framework should be the future of laptops.
The first laptop that piqued my interest in like 5 years
When he sees the keyboard being see through....  And thus a meme was born. (Claiming it right now if it becomes popular)
I really hope this product takes off further. It's made with a lot of care and is built for repairability and accessibility. I only worry that it might be difficult for them to compete with larger companies who take advantage of unrepairability to make an extra buck. I'm willing to support them 100%. *Edit:* If there's any sort of wishlist I have for this product, it would probably be a dedicated GPU and/or a high refresh rate display. I get if the former would be unfeasible considering the motherboard layout, though.
Well some would like it but more Upgradibility would be needed for future generations so that they can compete.
Linus @ 14:17 : “The Dell’s not even fucking thinner”   Dell: 👀💧
Seems their website is not rated to handle this much volume, lol
I know you guys want to express excitement, but holy fucking tinnitus warning
This needs more views. Algorithm+
11:55 Wolf Link joins LMG
Louis Rossmann Heavy Breathing
Ngl I really kinda wanna get one
I hope not just main boards are upgradeable in future, but also onboard graphics too. It would be sweet to go from GTX 1660 to RTX 3070 or 80. Granted in a thicker chassis for gamers. Also why not upgradable batteries.
Amazing product, I'm basically sold. Only *possible* gripe I could maybe make is its Intel instead of AMD. Holy crap I'm excited though, hope they keep going strong.  Also:   "How can these guys be so put together?" They clearly weren't expecting LTT to accidentally DDoS them were they? XD  Went to configure one to see how much they cost, their website wouldn't let me.
Give me a trackpoint, thinklight, and a hardware switch for the battery and I'm sold! Been looking for a modular laptop that can mostly replace my Thinkpad T420 for a while now, and this might be the closest thing next to a System76 laptop.  Also don't get me wrong the T420 is an excellent laptop, but it's just a bit slow when transferring data, and it's lacking some power for certain tasks that I want to do with it.
Yeah no this project is going to die in a few months or years. Sadly
I absolutely love this!! I'll have to try and snag one of these. This modularity is exactly what we need for sustainability
I would have bought one but i cant really afford even a 5-7year old laptop! 😩😩
Dang, they did it, they finally put a marker on the future of e-waste, every device should be like this, now looking forward to seeing some with GPU
Modular Display port on a laptop? Take my fucken ass money right now! ..... i realized I only have a 1080p VGA and DVI monitor. An AMD version of this will make my wallet empty.
if anyone is wondering the base price for an i5 4.2ghz is 750 USD,  i7 4.7ghz +300 USD, I7 4.8ghz  +700 USD  this is with no ram no SSD no wifi no dongles (posted this because the site is having issues atm )
Ltt should do a video in which linus fixes his broken phone
I bet Louis Rossmann nearly had an orgasm watching this video!!  Such a great idea and so well executed too!!  I REALLY hope they do well!!!
They need to license their motherboard layout so they can get paid for third parties making ARM, AMD and RISC-V boards.
Hey, that razer pc looks dope af...
Either you crashed their site... or  they need to hire an actual web developer.
Aaaaaand Linus crashed Framework's order servers.
sold!
I was hoping for a socketable CPU but otherwise this is a fantastic machine. If I had a reason for a new laptop this would be it!
finally after the last decennia we are switching back to self repairable products!!!! stoked!!!
6:17 The difference between a modular system and a one that you can't repair is the difference between a company that will* get bust and one that is rated a trillion dollars ... If it gains any traction, it will be purchased by another company ... Apple maybe, and then they will make it fade into obscurity.  I hope not, but I only can be cynical at this point.  *=hopefully only might
I don’t want/need a laptop… really tempted to buy this just to support them!
Now I want one
went to their site, evertytime I clicked on ANYTHING I got a "something went wrong" screen
Seems like such a great company. Hopefully they don't go the way of oneplus when the dollars come in and just become everyone else
A dream laptop!
If one came with the option to save money by installing a Linux Distro out of the box, Pop OS and Steam OS 3.0, I'd be sold instantly.
omg im going to cry this is so beautiful!
What an awesome teaching tool plus physically turn off the mic... now they are doing TECH BLASPHEMY. this company will be nuked and rail roaded as FREEDOM PHONE LAPTOP, once the nonces at gizmodo get sniffers on this product. Tech gets infinitely smarter and more user friendly...   Users have been given electronic social-meds for digi-lobo-modz, douches unite under " but but what if we could choose?" as facism for new 9chan natzis
if phones and laptops can have the customisablility and configuratbility and upgradability of PCs nowadays, then that would be absolutely revolutionary
This video feels kinda sluggish and weird. Are you recording in 24 FPS? With an Iphone? It feels weird.
I wish I didn’t buy a new dell last year.  But I know what I’m buying for my next laptop
If I had the money to burn I’d go buy one right now. I hate seeing products like this fail and wish I could do something to help them succeed.
That’s the kind of company I would willing to pay all my money to invest in
Love to see this kind of technology
I've upgraded my old 2009/2010 satellite pro l300 over the years still serves well as a general purpose web browsing machine and portable media device.  screen from 1280x800 to 1920x1200 (panel came from a hp elitebook, required new cable from another toshiba model with high res screen) makes use of a dvb=t2 usb receeiver for hd tv reception.  upgraded the wifi to a wireless n module  2ghz pentium to 2.8ghz c2d which supports intel ida upto 2.93ghz which can be locked on both cores using throttle stop for a kind of overclock.(supports 3.06ghz c2d inc extreme edition, not sure if c2q is an option)  2gb 667 ram to 4gb 800 (upgradeable to 8gb but price is prohibitive on 4gb ddr2 modules)  160gb hdd to 250gb ssd (sata 2 speed limited :(  )  added a webcam and screen bezel from a broken machine.  odd drive swapped for 1tb hdd  6 cell battery upgraded to 12 cell  expresscard to 3x usb 3.0 adapter (hardly ever use so looking for something else useful to make use of it)
I would definitely buy this if I were in the marker for a laptop
3:2 Display? Hm... I kinda dig that
my biggest question is, can u put custom keycaps and mechanical switches into the keyboard?
amazing!!!
We need to support this manufacturer.
17:30 ACTIVATE WINDOWS LINUS
Sound's great so long as the new motherboard, or board/gpu combo does not cost as much as a new system. And of course the system priced competitively.
Apple and others don't build their crap unrepairable because they don't trust end users, that's what warnings and warranty requirements are for! They do it so they can be the sole "Authority" on repair, and then not repair jack, feed you a kazillion lines of BS about how it's beneficial, saves you and your children from certain death... and rob you blind after suggesting you pop for new gear, and you're dumb enough to do so!  As far as I can tell these days, people are indeed so freaking gullible, not only have they been getting away with it, they have the general public trained to come back for more abuse, and be happy to pay extra be screwed over again and again!
How to put Louis Rossman out of business: Spend Millions upon Millions of Dollars lobbying to politicians to create BS Laws to prevent 3rd party repairs? No Spend Billions on R&D to make it as hard as possible to work on? No Create a Laptop that you can work on and include QR codes to identify what needs to be replaced and how to and make it easy to open? Yes
"all core 3.3ghz" meanwhile AMD "oh yeah we forgot to make the laptop cpu locked so here you go 4.2 ghz all core turbo" On a laptop!
If I was looking for a laptop right now, I'd get this one. I don't like to have an Intel Tigerlake CPU, but the repairability... I have already repaired or at least opened up a dozen of laptops and I also always regretted it shortly afterwards.... This sounds almost too good to be true.. I mean... Full-size DP? Holy banana split...
Making a prediction right now: Apple is going to take the io system.
Once there is a touch screen option...it will be my new rig 😎
... throw in a touch screen and I'm sold. First thing that seems like it'll be able to replace my pixelbook.
I had high hope for Framework, and you've sold me on it.  Putting down a deposit today.
Lol, went to their website and....   "We're sorry, but something went wrong"
18:23 IT'S COUPON, the U comes after the O :D
Their Servers are burning rn 😂 Too many People are using them rn
the framework website appears to have crashed? too much traffic.
This computer defies the logic of the market in the past 5 or more years and the most exiting thing to Linus is a 3.5mm headphone jack and extra screws
Lol, the sites "undergoing maintenance" now. Drove way too much traffic there.
If I were in the market for a new laptop and didn't need a gaming laptop(I do compile videos for my family) I woould LOVE to get one. Unfortunately there is no option for any GPU. Even if it isn't upgradable, I would prefer one with a discrete GPU.
11:57 This is so great, I fell out of my chair and hurt my arm pretty badly, but it was still worth it
This video made me regret buying a laptop 2 months ago. God, this is a good product.
I hope they bankrupt all other laptops. I still won't use one as I'm a desktop David for the forseable future but its cool to see regardless for people that need mobility and also want longevity
wow, cant wait for a gaming laptop from them
It looks like my new laptop.
No-case-Linus's Note 9 has met its demise 1:56
I think their site is crashing :)
if you drop it it will be ok because you can just rebuild it like lego
The last time I had a laptop this modular was my Inspiron 4000... the OG one in 2001 😮It had those wrist rest pads in different colors, among other things. Can I get some PC cards here? 😆
Commenting for da YouTube AI
Who edits your videos? Kudos to them...
Can it run kubuntu?
Who the fuck says 1/6"?? 85/512" is the closest I'd go on a machine.
GN should review this....
15:33 use one of those Volta chargers?
I think this is the most positive review I've ever seen Linus give. When he said "Now I want to invest" I knew this was a fucking good laptop.
This is actually a product and company I would like to see more of in future videos.
Sorry to say this but this will probably fail unfortunately, like modular phones did. I don't like conspiracies but, spare me on this one, what interest do big companies have to see this thrive? It's a very cool idea, and there should be more companies and manufactures like this, so we do have market competition to drive prices lower, but right now this is hard. Congrats on the effort keep up the good work
Right to repair, bang! Asus should just send you a new Wi-Fi module if it's flacking out after a few hours of being on and I insert the one from the broken Lenovo and it works like one would expect it would. In fact they sell it on Newegg because it's for 10th gen Intel, But any one works minus a feature or 2. Losing faith in support because they wanted whole PC to send a new one, not having it. Data is a thing, and having to update OS from 1902 to 21H1.
I want one!!!! No, I want four!!! Each for every one of my kids and me!
But patents are good for innovation.  /s
My 3 year old xps 13 display dies and now I have to pay for a new display and like 2 times the display for shipping because third world.
EU shop please :(
i really hope that they're around in 2-3 years when i need a new laptop cuz that sounded like the perfect choice
im really interested to get one..
Price is fine, good configs available (love the BYO options for memory and storage!) decent enough display, decent weight. The only module missing from their current list is a proper RJ45 GB ethernet port.   I mean, I won't ditch and sell my XPS15 for it - I like my bigger screen and the dedicated GPU but if I still had my HP Spectre, I'd probably make the switch.  Let's just hope they'll find enough customers and can survive long enough to establish themselves. This product looks so damn promising.
Just give me black version of it and take my money
If they had AMD options i'd had bought one before the video was finished XD Why did it took manufacturers this long to make a laptop you can service? greed is powerful in all the big techs nowadays!
I hope this drives changes in companies' philosophy for repairability. I'm not giving up HDR 4k displays, and I really don't care about upgradability in a notebook, since the first thing to expire for me is always the CPU/iGPU performance. But I'd absolutely love to know that if I spill coffee on it, or drop it on the floor, it won't require me to buy a new one instead of just replacing a cracked display or fried battery.
4:58 no
the music sounds like stal from minecraft at 10:05
I can see this company doing very well now after this video went live. Especially with Linus pre-ordering one WHILE THE CAMERA WAS STILL ROLLING  Lmao
Framework has quickly skyrocketed to my super exclusive list of companies that I actually trust
That's the coolest laptop i ever seen  I need to buy one
that one year to engineer this. It just goes to show how slowed the development of things can become by companies who focus on anticonsumer features. The amount of work a company has to put in to making something not repairable is the reason someone like apple can spend 3+ years in r&d on a product that could be much more easily (and sustainably) built using a philosophy like frameworks
They're on the right track I suppose, I'm kinda turned off by no mxm socket though
Magnetic connectors are guarded by apple/microsoft patents????/??? I thought nobody else was interested in making them
Will buy one in the future
Linus, this laptop is very exciting. Can you do a test to see if it will run Linux? By what I see there should be no reason it wouldn't and I would love to know for sure. You see, I run Linux as a daily driver and would consider buying this laptop if it can. Thanks!
Also what about the gpu?
Hold up... _THE SCREEN HAS THE SAME ASPECT RATIO AS THE SCREEN OF A GBA!!!!! THIS IS A RETRO GAMER'S DREAM!!!!!_
they should partner with dbrand with Linus face bezel.
This is awesome!
I'm gonna buy this honestly.
But... But...      Can it play Crysis?
Comment for algorithm so more people can see this
This thing looks incredible, when I need a new laptop, it is surely gonna be this one. Assuming their website is working again by that time :)
Hope they have AMD powered laptops in The future
Their website is... how to put it... tango-down?  So, Linus has the power to DDOS any website. I smell the new source of income 🤣
If it comes to the UK I will invest in this
This literally solves all of my problems with owning laptops I really hope they take off this is such an amazing idea.
If I hadn't already splurged almost £2000 on a laptop 18 months ago, I'd give them my money just for being so damned cool.  Edit: One of the coolest features I noticed when I saw this for the first time this morning, but which nobody seems to be talking about, is the insane level of design detail, right down to length of the keyboard ribbon. The number of times I've tried to repair laptops in recent years where I've struggled to even reach the ribbon latch because the ribbon's been so short is at a level where it's long ago stopped being funny.
Too bad these are only available in Intel. Also $1,000 for the base model 256/i5 is Apple expensive...
I want one, but their site is just bugging out with the amount of attention it's getting I think.
I would get it if it had a graphics card so I will wait till they get better specs gaming framework laptop
I love the concept, but I wish it had swappable CPU& GPU. It's like a runner that trips just before the finish line. I'd still consider buying one if I could get one in Australia & you can game with it.
The thumbnail made me think they were inserting Juul pods into a laptop
I wonder who would dislike such video of a good product like that?! dell, asus, an apple user who thinks that a right to repair is a bad thing!
& when new technology in anything comes along, they can just make it work! ie: new battery tech, all they need to do is have you replace both the battery & battery charging circuit(if that needs changing that is) plus with the way batteries are going, with new chemistries, you can get even more out of the battery! So, win win for the consumer!
This company is great, I love the repairability. You should do a video tearing it down as far as you can get and upgrading or just reassembling it back to the original form factor (ie sleeper)
Thumbs up to those engineers, this is the way to limit our e-waste and keep the right to repair alive.
I notice you dropped your Note 9 there lol
This has the potential to be a repeat of the Apple of the 80's.
I actually considered buying one right after watching this video, since I need a new work Laptop anyway and also other people like Louis  are also talking about them. Unfortunately they don't take preorders from Europe yet. But it seems I am not the only person interested, the site is under heavy load and quite sluggish, which I assume has something to do with the release of this video.
I guess that's the 'slashdot' effect for you, now instigated by LTT ;) Framework's site's down for the count.
Fucking editor man...
Cool
Sorry i cant see the video right now. But can you swap the processor and the video card?.
if only socketed mobile CPU is still a thing for both Intel and AMD. Imagine if you could swap out the CPU in case for some strange reason it's your 1135G7 that is misbehaving and you could swap it out with 1155G7 or something else that still in the range for the heatsink
I'm sad I don't need a laptop right now.
11:53 that legitimately scared me.
Nice one
"BTW casually I bought one" always got to flex
11:52 pls tell the editor to give me my breath back xD
Why is there no windows in a apple store
Maybe, in year 2069, we will have modular gaming laptop
So how much was it?
dude... please be the future
This is really exciting and encouraging in an age of throw everything away.
Great way to generate revenue after the initial sell.
This is a great laptop to teach kids how to fix or take apart or learning how it works!
omg omg omg I freking loved it
I dont even need a laptop but i sure want to buy one now!
That is 🔥
WOW! This looks amazing. This will be my next laptop for sure.
I hope that they stay in business. Apple needs to go. Dropped Lenovo and screen connector fell off.
Thats a extremly nice concept. A little bit more IO would be nice, for example a dual USB addon but it's OK
Very smart!
Here's hoping that this company (and especially, their values) survive and be profitable so this goes mainstream and we actually see these on our local stores. Cheers!
That looks really sexy. Too bad they don't ship to EU
holy moly, the bios looks like 1998 and i like it!
I'm not saying that I regret buying my new Spin 3 recently. It is a great 2-in-1 and I won't say it. Only think about it for a while probably.
Will they use ryzen socs?
There are on 2 extremes - one is a Corp that has 1000's of highly skilled, highly intelligent staff, vs one that probably has less than 10 of said smart & experienced staff.
This will definitely be my next laptop purchase
reminds me of ExpressCard...
Can we all appreciate that dank editing at 11:52
It's not an LTT video unless Linus is flailing the fragile product around and possibly dropping it.
18:23 "Cupon", it's a coupon. It's not queue.
I have been in love with this idea, but I was put off by the pricing. And lack of AMD. Maybe that will change.
Well some peoples nose must be extremely long by now
crap i cant get those headphones because i dont have such a store in germany
Looking forward to an AMD or ARM version!
Cant like this enough.
Wireless mice are prone to interference
2:19 me when I’m drunk and tryna explain smt to my friends :/
1080p 60fps webcam? Why any other didnt do that?!
Maybe I'm alone, but I like thickbooks.
man, if only they put that much work in their website infra
What are the chances that one could install MacOS with full functionality?
I hope that this will be a hit with IT departments.
I'll take 2 of those beautiful things
I think they should sell motherboards with different CPUs on there. You think people would buy that? If a new cpu comes out, I sure as hell would
And then the company will die in couple years, and your whole "upgradability" goes out of the window.
Looks great, I need a bigger one though.
16:24 is your battery swells when plugged into the wall then the bms isn't doing its job.
hug of death on framework's website, honestly there are a few other modules that they could include: nfc/rfid readers. a cellular modem/ smartcard reader. They could make the module dimensions easily available and people could start putting their own things in there. One really good benefit to doing the modules like this with a usb type c interface is that they can be used on other machines as well, so if they do get a good name for them selves with the peripherals they could stay profitable even if people dont buy the computers.
Boy, imagine those SSD Expansion cards were compatible with cameras, just unplug from camera and into the laptop in seconds. So much potential to make this modules the standard.
Laptops don't have enough durable video ports. Did they fix that? Are those pluggable ports? That's the main thing I want besides Linux. If I break a thunderbolt port, I can't use 2 monitors. I thought the 2018 Macbook Pro was the best laptop today.
Ok is the processor upgradeable that's would be a nice feature?
I'm loving this! Will get myself a Framework soon!  Side note: Linus you heathen! You want to touch your screen so you can annoy yourself with smudges? j/k love ya 🤣
Finally I found what kind of laptop I want.
The new dell at its origin. Great startup, where to invest show me the path.
Hope it can be a new "standard"
Dude this is awesome! Definitely going to consider buying one if I ever need a laptop! I hope this company stays along for a long time.
This is awesome
Loosing his mind
Hopefully there will be option to choose Ryzen CPU in the future :D
Amazing product. We need to support this and let the rest of the industry see this is what we want.  Not SoCs that look better on benchmarks than they do in real life and give the manufacturer complete  lockout of any upgrade path.
does installing macOS work on it?
Im speechless. This is probably the dopest laptop i have seen.
I like the swappable IO idea because you can change the side in which the IO is located, you can have all the IO you need, and when one of the ports wears out, you don't need to replace the main board.
Cannot wait for it to to UK !
14:42: RIP Alex
The thing I'm mostly missing is USB ports. I wonder if there could be a modular IO expansion cards multiple USB-C connectors. Maybe there's enough space for 3/4 in one module. That would be awesome for me! What I'm missing is sockets and not bandwidth with those USB-C. Ofc, they would share the USB 3.2 socket bandwidth and power but the speeds would be just fine for me. USB 2.0 has a decent bandwidth
whitelisting components in bios is an pain for upgrading
Man I hope they stick around. This is awesome. 😎
You know what kind of makes me sad? If the right to repair REALLY kicks in, considering the low time to market that Framework had, every big tech company will copy their business model and bring them out of business quickly It's for sure a win to consumers, but might not be so for the entrepreneurs Of course the quickest way might be to buy Framework itself, so these guys will be ok...
Give a man a fish and feed him for a day, teach a man how to fish and feed him for a lifetime!
Can I have a PC?
Site doesn't work but project is cool
Install osx on it!
Good job guys, you crashed their site.
I've been disgusted with throw away and replace culture and manufacturers seeing this as a good thing to increase $.  Every company has to make a profit but it's become very anti consumer.  What a great direction this company is taking, I hope it changes the current climate in regards to being able to fix (or not) our devices.
My 2009 ASUS F9e had socketed CPU and yes it was somewhat more bulky but I am sure it could be arranged maybe at the expense of 6-7 mm :D could hold a bigger battery :D
And LTT killed the framework website with this video 😂
I mean it's cool, but we have been burned with this kind of modular tech many times before. The problems are many, like how to keep manufacturing and assembly costs down, but the main problem is that most people do not care at all about modularity or upgradeability. Being the "tech guy" in my circle, no matter how i preach about these kinds of things, unless i do the research and the work for them, they just go to a store and ask for a thing in their price range and get a thing that looks nice and meet the minimum requirements for the thing they use it for. People have enough shit to deal with, and researching these things for someone who is not into tech rarely comes into the priority list. Unless this kind of mentality changes, the modular and upgradable tech will be a niche at best and fail miserably at worst.
Unfortunately just recently bought a new laptop. I hope they will be still around when I need to replace it in a few years.
I’ve been waiting for this, it’s such a clever idea to combine the swappable slots with easily replaceable internals. Win-win.
Wow , finally something worth my attention in laptop world
Frame.work makes repairable, upgradable, affordable, and thin laptop, every other laptop company: “Chuckles, I’m in danger”
This is the best notebook ever🔥
I would invest in this
AND HE DELL IS NOT EVEN F*ING THINNER
I've never seen Linus this happy and excited.
Apple spends billions of dollars in R&D to make sure you CAN'T repair things.
I can’t like this video enough
Rad.
The power on AC plug is insanely useful for if you move the laptop into a PC case. Tech Perks did it with one with a smashed screen.
Offer a larger version with a badass gpu that can replaced/upgraded every generation and I'm sold on it. But the fact that you just need to remove 5 screws then the keyboard and top panel pops off, rather than using a prying tool to pop a bunch of shitty tabs that break to remove the back panel is amazing
This is like '95 all over again :P
This is a laptop I can get behind. But their web site got LLT bug lol.
Id be happy with a large laptop that can be upgradeable. Yes it's a laptop but I mean most who get gaming laptops are mostly going to use them at home.
"Christmas skin keyboard for the holidays" type of modularity
No mention of the graphics card? Can that part be upgraded? I'd be interested on how well it can game.
What was Linus talking about with running the motherboard in a pc outside of this laptop? Why would you want to do that? Did I miss something?
Website is currently dying
Okay...show me it running open core and OSX then I will seriously consider.
So, you’ve make’d frame.work website crash
TIL linus is a weeb
The idea is cool but in 5 years from now this cie will not exist anymore and you will have to toss your laptop in the garbage anyway.
I wish my laptop had upgradable ram 8gigs not enough
I hope they have success with this and manage to stick around. My laptop is still working fine but I'd definitely go for one of these when it is time to get a new one.
framework's website is exploding atm
last time i felt like this i said i love you to my crush
Although not really looking to buy a laptop any time soon or at any time in the future even, I would love to see stuff like this being tried in the Desktop world, since modularity there has been quite stagnant, would especially love to see this in the PC case side of things, would have loved being able to upgrade my Corsair 780T with some modern case features, and atm finding a replacement that perfectly fits my bill has been quite difficult.
The (as of now) 307 people who thumbs downed the video clearly hate fun and customizability, and themselves.
Honest opinion here: proprietary modular expansion failed basically every time in the past and this is just gonna be the next quickly forgotten note in that book. Hate to be a hype killer. I like the thing. But it is what it is.
*everyone liked that*
Would be cool if they would partner with system76 and get a Linux version
Framework did a great job... good work guys keep it up 🙂
That was really cool, interested to see more
Linus you crashed their website configurator. I'm impressed.
Aight, I'm convinced, I'm buying one
I went to the website for this laptop and you can't even look at options because it's broken
Went to order one on the website. So many people going to order one that you can't get through to configure one. Good job Linus. 👏  This is a great idea, for tech. I was in the market for a skid steer and mini excavator and was going to get Deer but than remembered they don't like the "right to repair" so I went with Bobcat where my dealer said any part I want I can have to repair.
Instead of having the battery off in bios Id be so appreaciative of like a swtich that does it mechanically so that its just if im in my office and know itll be plugged in i can switch it off and not need to dig into bios.
I bought a DIY setup in April!  Should be getting it any day now!  So excited for my framework lappy!!!
Frame work should make a phone
Man that is a sweet laptop. I think that may be my next lappy.
Well, that's amazing! I hope this company does well.
remember the modular smartphone of a couple of years ago? Yeah we all have modular smartphones now...
Could YT add a multiple click like ?!
It is stupid to have glossy monitor!!
sadly the website is notfunctional so i cannot see what they offer, the configure now section goes to a "something went wrong" page
I love how Linus gets wowed every 1 minutes
I would buy this right now if it came with Ryzen.
I will wait the one with AMD APU <3
Repairability laws have been passed in Europe and are being discussed in the US.
I'm so freaken happy - no further comment
Their site crashed.... prolly didn't see our flood coming! 😂
Don't say you bought a sponsor spot you didn't buy shit!!!
It just brings me back to the top of the page when I press configure now :((
Linus can 10x a company's quarterly earnings report and fry server hardware (R.I.P. Frameworks Web Server) in under 20 minutes.   He is, enlightened.
Sadded that they are not yet available here in the UK, this product is the dream
Holy shit 5 screws... Why doesn't mine have such easy access for cleaning and upgrading?!   I hope they do a higher performance model with AMD CPU and GPU.. Than It'll be definitely on the list to remind me on what I'll buy next year..
Very very cool, I'd love to see a gaming focused laptop out of them!
This video is making their site crash
while the dell 2570p that I have used for a long ol' time isn't AS customizable or thin it DOES have bigger battery options pci slots dual channel memory and a socketed cpu and the bottom panel is held on by a spring lock that slides off... SOME of dells laptops were actually pretty good aside from cosmetics and keyboard I cant think of anything other than that i would want to customize and personally I prefer a thicker laptop because I'm less worried it will snap in half. That said the guys at framework absolutely have the right idea and I hope they are successful.
I might have to chuck my laptop against the wall to justify replacing it.   Depending on specs.  I need something with a DGPU
but are the modular connectors propriatary?
A configurable RISC V dev machine... Please be the future 🙏
Love the laptop but that keyboard got me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is awesome.
This happens when engineers and not economics people lead the company
Leaving a comment to boost this video for other audiences. This needs to be seen!
Upgradable wireless? Dont checked new ones but once upone time there were whitelist of wifis, and machine wont even boot if u put non whitelisted one.
Seeing that my own laptop's Bluetooth died from a recent update (thanks 21H1) and is still under warranty, I'm tempted to swap it for this. Hmm
I hate that it's just a laptop with 4 USB C ports and several dongles that fit in them. I want more than 4 ports lol
Maybe one day we'll see one with internal optical drive options
Damm i just buy a stupid lg not upgradable
if framework decides to make it even more upgradable they could standardize the motherboard layout and screen mounting and make that open. then anyone could make and sell a motherboard or screen. you want arm and 4k touch then just buy those parts.
Na that camera is Great
Is there libreboot or coreboot for this device?
The disconnect battery feature should be on all laptops by default like how hard is it to make it so that once your laptop reaches 100% charge just use the juice from the outlet to power the device. It’s not that hard. iPhones do it. And it genuinely can save battery life
Dude this thing is SICK!!
The Dell's not even ..
I have a slim, light and nice looking notebook already which is designed for easy repairing and upgrading and I find also manual to repair the notebook on the manufactures. Also, the manufacturer still give guarantee to all original parts even a swap one parts. There's no glue. I know it because I remove battery, SSD and NVMe to reset the BIOS by removing the battery (I didn't expect the manual and search after it first after removing the battery and the NVMe.) But I have to remove less than 20 screws, three clips (for keyboard and mousepad) and one connector (battery). The entire software from BIOS over firmware to OS are open-source, except NVIDIAS graphic drivers for my GeForce RTX 2060. So, I don't understand why he's so hyped or say it would be the first easy repairable notebook. It's not true.
To be honest Apple, HP, Dell or microsoft wont allow framework to sell at retailers. And this is how they'll go brankruft in 2 years.
Now I want one just off of principle
Just when I was looking into getting a new laptop this comes up. Had to pinch myself; "Is it true?". I know where I'll be spending my CDN loonies. Perfect timming. Thanks LTT! I'll have to wait till their site is back up and running again.
God i hope this will be a succes
This is probably the only time I've ever seen a tech company, commit and successfully develop an idea/concept that is 99% what the customer wants and needs in the product. Great job frame work😁😁🤗🤗
Ok... I'm waiting for the new MacBook Pro this fall and it's the first time that I saw a laptop make me think on buy instead a Mac... mmm... this laptop is REALLY cool!
this is probably the first time ever that i have considered getting a laptop.
Hopefully they add a more powerful CPU and GPU, this would be great if you could switch to a forget charger at home travel config with a lower powered processor and larger battery, then when you get home switch to a game config with a RTX 3060 and more powerful CPU option
"basically I'm saying my EX-girlfriend is a terrible person...."? :P
15:19 Just use a Volta cable, which sponsors your channel ;)
Wow I love this!  Time to save up.
Is this a showcase or review?
I watch a lot of laptop reviews here, this is the most interesting yet
Framework's site is down from all of the traffic from this video. Looks like a lot of people are interested in this, myself included.
Haaaaaa! Put this on recommended lists of laptops everywhere! ASAP!!
DID YOU JUST SAY  MY T430 IS CRAPPY
This might be a controversial opinion, but the expansion modules are not my favorite.   If you look at the images, and listen to Linus' description in the video, the "expansion" modules just connect to the laptop via USB-C.   So they're just dongles.  But inside the laptop. Which is worse!   Now they take up valuable space that could have been more battery, or cooling, or interior expandable storage (which could be high speed and thus usable for a bootable OS).   They should have just made all i/o USB-C and offered dongles during the configuration and checkout.   Don't get me wrong, I love the idea and fully support the vision, just not sure the expansion modules are really a good implementation of that.
Now if only it came with Ryzen CPUs and a removable GPU like older laptops it would be ideal
But can it run crysis???
Would love this if they made a bigger version with a numpad.
Would be nice if we see some AMD, and even ARM options, maybe even cm4 board.
TL:DR BUY A VOLTA CABLE IF YOU WANT A MAGNETIC CHARGER  Im well aware this will get buried but since I haven't seen it in the comments I'd like to point out that linus talking about the magnetic charger not being allowed because of patents. he seems unaware of the volta cable which has a small magnetic tip, which you can leave in the laptop and its only a couple gram. I know that jake has one at his home setup because it was mentioned in an vid once.
actually, some laptops do have sockets. an example is mine. very old but it has socket rPGA988B or socket G2. there are probably more but idk about em
As long as they wont let me slap a serial port onto it, it is as useless as any other notebook in the world. Why do you hate network technicians notebook makers! WHY?!?!
As far as the magnetic connector for charging goes, just have the USB type C expansion module, and use a Volta Type C magnetic tip/cable for charging. Leave the tip in the laptop and BOOM you've got basically the same thing. Those tips hold tight in USB c ports too.
Battery disconnect needs to be a hot-key button!
Was holding out a new laptop for school in a few months. I’m 100% supporting this company! I’ll squeak by with my old Mac book for now in waits for this!
Guys that made this laptop live in the distant past,when things were made high quality and ment to last long time.
Company will go bust within 10 years.
they should make modules with more thsn just one port like for exmaple 2x USB A or  USB A + USB C or 2x USB C, and also at least one fixed USB C port
So price?
You didn't give the webcam enough praise, that is for real the best webcam I have ever seen in a laptop.
Awesome
Noice!
Anthony should review this laptop
Great ad placement there on the pre-roll, Apple.
Heard about these guysa couple of months ago, didn't think they would get out this thing so soon... Glad to see the demand on their website, I will order one as soon as their shop allows me to 😂
You dropped their website.
I’m buying one definitely
Tbh thats just american capitalism bullshit. Tech companies figured, why they should let you repair it when they can sell new, so they sell new. Those companies dont care about environment. Nice to see it from that company that its possible in a different way, but tbh everyone knew it was possible, they just didnt want to
If I cannot swap out GPUs and CPUs it's just a slightly easier laptop to work on, not really focusing on the bits most people like to upgrade to keep their machine useable for a few years.
I like how ltt and another few channels are not using 16:9 ratio and more like 18:9 .the image fits allmost perfectly on my note 9 without expanding it.
If they make a high-performance version in a couple of years I'm getting it because this is *sick*
mark my words.  NEVER.GONNA.HAPPEN.
I've not seen Linus so genuinely excited by a product in at least a couple of years. Hell, this is the first machine I've been tempted by in ages.
I hope they will make a convertible laptop as well, something like that is what I've been waiting on for years.
11:34 Subtitles says (cough) Dell🤣
I dream of a future where you can buy a new GPU or CPU or RAM, and modularly install it
i want a cry me a river tshirt featuring alex. make it happen pls
Best webcam quality I saw in a laptop after the MS Surface ones.
I was just thinking about how modularity would do the exact same thing as having to carry around a bunch of dongles before you mentioned it. Such a great solution and it's the most obvious, simple one too. I would LOVE to see this kind of laptop get some maturity on the market because I would immediately buy it as long as it had the right specs for my needs. I would be willing to get a beefier laptop if it meant it had a more aggressive and expansive cooling solution and it had a dedicated gpu, for example. All the work acer, asus, razer, and other laptop brands have done creating innovative ways of cooling powerful laptop hardware in small form factors combined with this level of modularity? Goddamn
I normally don't give a hoot about laptops, but this is potentially a game changer. Based on initial impressions, I really hope this company succeeds, but more importantly I hope they stick to this business model (allowing for improvements obvs) as they seem to have nailed it at the first attempt. Well done.
I need to tape the knowledge of the Linus community is there a laptop out there powerful enough to run Pimax 8KX (in Canada)
Could they also make the motherboard upgradable? order it with the cpu soldered, and then replace it?
It reminds me of Foneblocks
Framework and Fairphone will be the two companies I will try to support from now on. And Akai for music stuff. Enough with brands ripping off their own customers and polluting the world with cripple tech. Now we need a dedicated graphic card, though! Please never die Linus!
I want one sooo bad but the website keeps crashing nooooooooooo.
Why can surface not have something that disconnect the battery. I have to constantly charge it on the dock all the time....
They should partner with DBrand for custom keyboards, cases, screen frames, touch pads etc and they would do really well - ultimate configurability with ultimate customisability would be awesome
Annnnnd we crashed their site.
I always wanted a gaming laptop that can pop out a keyboard, to set it on the left side when im in bed, connect it via Bluetooth and that should uncover holes to get even better cooling, or whatever
That genius. Cant believe it took until 2021. Tbose early 2000s lappies almost encouraged you to upgrade hdd and ram at least.  Although my ibm r40 had a a wireless card white list. Pieces of shit. Hacked that with a c program. But then it had a bios kill switch if the cmos battery was removed, and that eventually died
This is a dream come true
Steam Deck made by Frame.work. On the Go Custom Console  !
Really awesome. Love to see these kinds of products. Upgradable, repairable and user friendly.
This is the most excited I've seen Linus in a long time. This thing looks amazing
That is really cool,
They will be buyed ouf out of market by Google/Apple and closed. For sure. Too good idea to stay alive.
too bad the replacable parts will be discontinued in 5 years like the stupid clevos.......
No mention to Panasonic Toughbook 55, lame!
While not as modular as the Framework, I have been happy with my HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop. It came with a 256gb NVME annnnnd an insert for the extra SSD slot. Opening it up was a bit of a pain but once I bit, both the NVME and SSD were right there.
What if someone casually comes and takes a port ?
Dear Linus  maybe is a time that you will explain WTF is going on about New World from Amazon which burns 3090 cards, are not those cads using thermal Throttling? Please explain situation
Good shit Nirav, represent. Hope it catches on. Good luck.
This is 100% the coolest product I've seen this year. If I had money to buy all the things I watch Youtube videos about this would be at the top of my list!
Iiiiiii am sooooo hyped for this thingggg..... finallyy Gooooodddd
after this video got posted frameworks servers just had a heart attack, the page keeps crashing lmao
After years if complaining and criticizing brands, linus should just make his own brand of tech
This is exactly what I've wished for for ages. I wonder if there's any plan to make exchangeable discrete GPUs too, that would be freaking amazing. Would be great to see 120Hz or touch display options too. Will definitely keep my eye on these guys (as soon as their site is up again :) ). Great review!
This is Awesome !
OMG, this is amazing. There are so many people going to the site RN that it's not loading 😄. Talk giving people what they want.
I'm absolutely loving this concept - RISC-V??  Yes please!!  <3 <3 <3
Im gonna cry, I want one. I took the battery out of my laptop so it stays fresh as I never take it off the charger  This company is the hero
Yes! Hope this pushes other companies to do the same when they realise everyone is buying them
me: let me watch a linus video youtube: ok but first watch our ad( its  about honey  featuring Linus)
if they had an IPS screen i would buy one...when they come to Europe.
i am totally on board this is great, i will be keeping an eye on them for the inevitable gaming version with a gpu.
The website is super slow, which suggests that A LOT of people are interested in this. GG, non-upgradable laptops.
Really rude from Adele to promise something and not deliver
It was made by engineers not the marketing team ,of course it makes sense
Linus, could you put you entire type-c hub instead of one of the official modular IO connectors?
I want to know what is Linus's favorite anime show?
0:20 they never did, companies just decided people didn't need high quality maintainable products. I'd prefer a heavier upgradeable device over the current thin and light crap.  I do like the idea of this framework laptop but it's still too thin for my liking
The moment you know its linus's phone, due to the cracks 😅
I watched this video in 4k and OMG am speechless
i love this
But seriously, will there be a trackpoint option for the keyboard?....
upgradeability, repairability and modularity is a selling point now?
9:32 white cable antenna on black labeled connector, black cable antenna on white labeled connector :)
As someone that owns and operates a computer, laptop and game console repair shop.... This does out a smile on my face
I just wanna know if this has Thunderbolt or not! Could be a transportable desktop replacement for me if it does! 😁
0:40 i also want to buy stuff and get money for it.
This is gonna be my next laptop, once my current one has done its job.
Good shit
this is amazing - i really hope this picks up
This makes me happy
Cool laptop, we might see one more model then it will be considered a flop never to be seen again since few people will buy it
does it come with windows?
Looks like a product designed and built by actual engineers and not some guy with an MBA eyeing to raise his net worth in the shortest period. Lets hope the company does well.
lol the website went:) 500 Internal Server Error
I'm pretty sure you made their site crash by posting this video. Can't configure right now.
Lol, the website is down
Is there a mxm slot?
I want one of this so bad now, seems great.
you are late to the video
Sounds like material for an awesome computer builder website that you just pick what you like in the wizard and they send you a computer with components you want exactly for your needs instead of needing to choose between approximations and make some sacrifices whether you get feature A and B or feature C and D when in reality you wanted B and D
Finally! Want it! "pre-orders not open in your region". damnit.
So it's a laptop with upgradeable memory, and inset dongles that are flush with the case.  Got it.
now i need money
seeing lunus not go full on gordon ramsye, just makes me happy
Coreboot?  This notebook is a dream
No UK orders yet🤬
I really love what I'm seeing here, but there's a few things that hold me back from buying. 1) I want AMD CPU options. 2) I want a GPU. 3) I like touch screen options. That being said, THIS IS SERIOUSLY AWESOME! I really hope they come out with AMD CPU and GPU options, plus touch screen options, because otherwise I really am not seeing reasons NOT to buy this! They even say on their website they test it with Linux! YAY!
This might be the most excited I've ever been about a laptop, that is so fucking cool
Wow. This is amazing. It's not idiotproof upgrade wise, but baby steps. I hope they flourish and stick to their guns. And recover from the LTT traffic haha.
System76 vs. Framework. Goooo!
It boggles my mind that it's taken this long for this.
I have the same energy when it comes to laptops, and I felt that in Linus lmao.  Definitely people, invest in these laptops for your next purchase. I'm dead serious. We can keep such people afloat by helping them out. This design philosophy must not die, and it must challenge corporate propaganda and their garbage excuses for why laptops can't be like this.
If their site didn't keep crashing, I'd order right now.  This idea is excellent!
If I hadnt a one year old surface pro I would buy it instantly.
This is the first time I'm actually really excited watching a product. Imagine a gaming laptop with this kind of upgradeability *gasp*
I think because of this video their website crashed.
remember Project Ara...?
Oh cool you can upgrade the CPU and GPU? The IO controllers? No? Oh ok gotcha.
14:42 - 14:50 I was not expecting that one bit. LMAOOOO
I've been waiting for this video
If they made a slightly  Bigger and thicker laptop that was more capable...  Better cooling so better GPU and more ports, That would be my next laptop.
This is Louis Rossmanns wet dream.
I don’t need a laptop but I might buy one because of what they represent.
how many IO ports?  5 is a minimun  for me ?  would be good to have 1 ethernet, 1 hdmi, 2 usb(mouse + headset) and 1 charge port
JUST TAKE MY MONEY
My XPS 13 is about four years old, and hopefully I'll get another few years out of it. But I am 100% getting one of these when the day finally comes. So fricking cool!
Right to repair on steroid
Finally there is someone that really cares about ressources on our planet and what customers want? That's amazing, I love it!
11:54 LOL. Big hats off moment to the editor ✌🏼👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is one of the best consumer products I've seen in a long time period.
I've been waiting for something like this for ages! What would be nice is that you can buy a replacement board  and swap your current one out, keeping everything else but keeping the board upgrade.  This will be the first site I visit when my current machine dies. Hopefully by then they could have touch and maybe some type of GPU integration.
Well I mean they could just sell Mainboards with better CPUs soldered on in the future to sustain the business model. If you already bought one of their devices, buying a new motherboard would be way cheaper than any laptop a competitor could sell, therefor binding you as the consumer to their company.
11:53 thank me later
the framework site is crushing xD
To be honest I'm surprised Apple isn't doing this. They could sell USB ports for like $300 a piece on your $3000 macbook.
i dont use laptops for the very reasons linus said in this video but if i ever did buy one then i would rather get something like this
Your video brough their site down. Cant wait to order one.
This is exactly what I nowadays want from a laptop. Just not having to think about which laptop to get next when upgrading and possibly having to adapt to a new "case". Once they offer mainboards with dGPUs I'm switching immediately. Currently not powerful enough for light CAD workflows.
Watching this on my 2012 Thinkpad X230 with upgraded memory, SSD + M2 and bigger battery.
Omg this is what I've been waiting for ... but ill wait till there's a Ryzen mod
This is great, hope I can get this someday
I can't remember that last time where I wanted a product so badly I immediately tried buying it while the video was still playing (manage to get my pre-order even with the crashes).
Good job guys. I think we just caused their website to crash.
Impossible! Then they can’t take my money every couple years xD
Their next model should be slightly more chunky with GPU options, then I would absolutely buy one.
they need to work with AMD and put Ryzen 5xxx APUs in that baby
1:38 haha nice, Linus Tech Tricks
I think this is the most positive review I've ever seen Linus give.
I realy hope this project doesnt flop like modular phones
Linus, I think your video crashed their website. I love that you're giving exposure to such a small company that cares so much about the end user experience.
Can you build pc in a gaining chair 🤔
This is looking amazing, their site is currently super slow/crashing soo I'm guessing they are dealing with 39845398584375 pre orders.
As Louis Rossmann likes to remember, phones can both be water resistant and have an easily removeable battery. Now laptops can also be modular while being simple to use and look good.  Let's hope other manufacturers will slowly run out of male Bovine manure arguments.
If they bring a 16"/17" model along with 4k HDR like my current laptop in the future, I'd definitely consider buying from them.
This could be some next-level laptop company that will reign the future. Really looking forward to it. ❤
This is just awesome! I'm just trying to imagine my Surface Book 2 could be upgradable like that...  This is the way Laptops, Tablets and Convertibles, maybe even Mobile Phones should be made - period!
Ok let’s be honest it ain’t that thin…
I love it love it love it!! I don't need a laptop, but I'll buy it only to support them! I LOVE IT!
Thoes QR codes are a great tool for someone like me who buys 2nd hand hardware a lot, and trying to find documentation on spicific motherboard revision parts compatibility, parts info, specific information about proprietary connectors. So perhaps with a laptop such as that, you could buy a new motherboard when their is a new generation of cpu. Or even moveing a motherboard to a diffrent case with different inbuilt features such as upgradeable GPU, full sized CD rom drive, or a case with a docking port. Part of me think that we may be returning to the days of the mac duo with portable desktops again.
Real Nice Go right to repair tech
Lol the framework website is crashing from the traffic right now
Linus's video crashed their site! LMAO!
Is there an optical drive compatible version? ^-^
His way of holding the laptops really scares me sometimes. It somehow shows his way of control over his personality.
Mind go 💥
This is so strange. Usually, I'd have to work hard on convincing myself to get a laptop by focusing on the few highlights. Never had I had such a deep desire to get a product. Is this love at first sight?
Yes!
This seems really neat! I hope they can actually manage to survive, since a lot of this seems to hinge on the company being around to produce the little modules or motherboard upgrades.  I also wish they had a option to buy this with a Linux distro. Adjacent to open and repairable hardware, Linux is the open and repairable choice of the software world.
This reminds me of the first OnePlus phone, made entirely for the consumer
That laptop is soo cool maan.
I dont even want a intel laptop right now, but because I want to support them so much, Im going to go shop on their site anyway.
Nice video
You know, when my Acer Aspire is biting the dust, or not keeping up with my demands (almost exclusive nightshift use to counter being tired when nothing is happening, ocasionally work and travel), I'm probably going to buy one of them. I mean it isn't even that much more expensive and I would have no qualms about buying a beast in terms ov volume taken up (like the older modular laptops often used by military and for field use), heck my first laptop was a thick boy and refurbished by my uncle, not to mention it was heavy AF.
This is fantastic except for the part where you can't upgrade the graphics card or have an option for a decent graphics card. Unfortunately that makes it a deal breaker. I'd want my laptop to also be able to play games. Maybe there will be another revision later on to support this?
I'd have ordered one if they had an equivalent to the laptop I bought a couple years ago for around $500 that I use for regular office and entertainment (music, streaming, movies). It's got a low end GPU but it plays 1080p just fine and has zero problem hosting network storage and YouTube videos while I'm doing something else with my other computer. Plus carrying it over to my living room and through HDMI playing movies and shows through my TV to receiver. Yes it's something I've owned since before HDMI existed because it's not broken and the quality of audio hasn't gotten any better over the past two decades.
Aaaaand the websites gone. Gonna check back later, really like the concept. Including different keyboard layouts. Thats unheard of in notebooks.
you should do a vid about making this magnetic connector
RIP framework website
I'll be interested when they come out with a 15/16 inch version.
Ha, Frameworks website just went down, "under maintenance". 26.07. behold the power of a youtube channel with 13.7 million subscribers! i myself will probably buy one too if the price is right.
Due to school I need a 2in1 so this isn't a option sadly (yet, maybe they'll make one in the future) but really great product.  Edit: And it's not available outside the US/CA which definitely kills it for me.
Definetly buying a framework laptop as my next laptop
Honestly, i am quite impressed and interested in this.
Have high hopes for this company. Would love to see more from them in the future as I recently got a laptop. Go framework!
Linus: Its only five screws to get this panel down. My old dell latituade laptop: it gets one.
This is really cool! I haven't been this excited for tech in a long time!
seems cool, I just hope they can actually provide the upgrades later... I would rather have a ryzen based system for example..
I think the mistake most other companies make is that they make concepts. These guys straight up came up with a solution. No proprietary bullshit, just standard hardware and a bit of creativity.
they should make a gaming one with gpu that you can swamp, would get even more people
Just bought a new laptop a week ago. Just preordered one of these. Guess my grandparents are getting a laptop upgrade
Linus needs sponsor segues so much that he even bought one
I've been burnt too often, so I'm going to let Linus test drive this for a bit... But this looks incredible.
I think the influx of people to their site broke it...can't pre-order one. I am totally SOLD.
This is now the video is the video I link someone when they ask me what laptop I would buy if I was held at gunpoint.
Portuguese subtitles please.
What about external GPU support?
You can buy a Type-C magnetic charging cables on Amazon. They're great for laptops you just leave the male bit perma in a port they barely stick out. And you don't lose a Type-C port to some proprietary connector crap.
thumbs up for Linus throwing it in under 2 minutes.
That's really cool, I just did a build on their website to see the minimum price of a fully functional machine, 11th gen i5, 8gb drr4, 1Tb nvme, for 975$, checked online shops for regular laptop, the most similar one I could find was an hp at 975€ (1100$) (so , with everything the same except a 256gb sata ssd (and the custom built one had no windows, but even after adding a 20$ license you're still good, I would never pay full price for it), really price competitive. Only problem is the delay... September for it to be shipped.
My old clevo p150hm died last year, I had upgraded the cpu from the bottom of the line sandy bridge quadcore, to the fastest XM sandy bridge unit, upgraded from 8gb to 16gb, upgraded the 500gb hard disk to an ssd, and put the hdd in the disk drive bay, I upgraded from a gtx 485m to 680m, I repasted the cpu and gpu myself, and even improved the cooling, which was easily accessible. I had also swapped out the screen. It truly was the most modular laptop, even at the time people didnt believe you could upgrade a laptop like that. The only issue was the bios was only capable of using up to the 680m, and even with that I had to modify nvidia drivers for it to work. Last year the mobo died, and I put it away in the tech closet.
way to go linus you crashed frame works website lol
I wish u could game on this thing
Linus. ya broke their website by getting so many people interested
According to Tested's review of this company one of their plans is to also allow the consumer purchase a new MOBO to upgrade/swap out the CPU
No gpu 😔
I want one. No, i NEED one.
this is awesome
I just hope that they come up with a 15 inch display format. It would give them more space to modularize and for us it would allow us to work more confortably! i know that you all like the 13 inch laptops for portability, but many of us need a bigger real state display on the go too!
I almost got tears in my eyes, because finally there's someone who takes the necessary steps in the right direction. I wish that they will be able to keep their promises and hopefully start a trend.
Wanted to go and preorder it, but they don't do orders from Germany yet. Hope they will succeed and expand so I can get my hands on one of these in the near future :)
Looks cool, but no AMD support....not really all that versatile then.
I want to buy my son this so he grows up learning more tech easily.
Maybe the market it's not ready to provide plugs to that...maybe in future.
I WANT ONE
So when the Internal USB-C port breaks,  what happens to that?
holy crap they need to bring this back with phones too, ffs
Just ordered one
This laptop is SICK!
When is there IPO?
I'd buy it if it had an ortholinear keyboard option
I saw an article on this product and said I wasn't going to read it and instead just wait for the LTT video on it.
actually when it comes to right to repair. they should be giving you a manual and schematics and the people that make the chips and other components should be able to send you replacements so you can repair it yourself. electronics used to be like this.
Blown away by this laptop. Hopefully they release a gaming version somehow. If I was in the market for a thin and light, I would totally order one.
This is pure gold.
Jesus is the truth…
Can we get a part 2 with some basic benchmarks and performance numbers?
The Dell Is Not F****g Thinner! 14:17
2010 laptops were much nicer than current laptops. They are way to thin have no style they just suck. If they made them thicker it would allow better battery life better cooling better performance. Why in God name do you need a super thin laptop. There is no benefit to it being thin bit there are tons of cons.
the real issue is that you can't upgrade mobo and cpu. so, for example, when DDR5 comes out or next gen cpu comes out, you still won't be able to upgrade, and the laptop will be out dated even if you swap everything else.
I want that available in Europe asap
Can we all just appreciate the cardboard packaging as well?  Well done!
I'd rather buy a nice older macbook for that price hell even a gaming laptop
This is literally the coolest laptop I have ever seen in my life! Hope they can add a touchscreen and some unchangable basic IOs other than the 3.5mm headphone jack to the body.
Damn, I really hope this will hold!
it made me really happy Linus bought one
Why is there website so extremly slow?
If I was in the market for a laptop, I'd get this for sure
I don't even need a new laptop but I want one. would love to see other options in Processors though.
If this had a GPU option, this would definitely be my next laptop!
Hmm, I think having a couple of fixed type C ports or at least one since you need it for charging would make sense. That way they can save a bit of space on things you obviously need and leave more room for custom slots
Any gpu options? Or just integrated iris from the Intel cpu's?
5:20  Anyone remember PC and express cards?
I’d order myself one if I could afford it but maybe next year or something. I’m wondering if I can become like a parts dealer or something for them since I do own and operate an electronics repair shop
"partnership with some anime show" you mean evangelion themed merchandise for this laptop? they've slapped the branding on everything else by now...
I’ve never been excited about a laptop, so I’m kinda confused lol.
Nice product, but i want to believe that Google's project ARA is and inspiration for this project! :)
Next thing that would be great fro companies to do - upgradeable GPU memory
mfs in 2031 finna be like, ew u got a prebuilt laptop
Lmao after Linus published this video the website crashed
aaaaand the site is down
Now this makes sense! Finally!
This is the first tech product that actually made me excited and eager to buy.
your idiot  hands lmaooo!!!
This thing looks sick
Framework really said "the dongles go on the inside now"
Frame Works Website isn't working anymore. Someone told me the cause can be found above the comments^^
Let me buy this damnit
If Framework ever offers options for artists (touch screen, stylus, etc.) and maybe Ryzen support, I would honestly buy one in a heartbeat. I'm even considering buying one NOW even though I currently have no need for a laptop just because of how incredibly awesome and well-thought-out the entire design is. God, I hope this thing succeeds so every other company will be forced to innovate and measure up to the same standard
you drop the phone :))
Looks amazing. I don't need a laptop or I would definitely support them if I  liked laptops lol. But if I ever need a laptop in the future I definitely know where I'm looking first.
Finally something good in 2021
When I finally see something I like and want the sites not working or its all out of stock. 😞
I want one.... but everything is transparent colored purple plastic. Like the cool kid gameboy!
I first heard of framework like a month ago, and seeing this video I was worried that it would go out of stock because of the hype.  Then I remembered, that I can't afford a new laptop and the hype will help me get cheaper parts later on.
Looks like LTT just crashed Framework's site.
When Linus said "The Dell's not even F-cking thinner" I died laughing
Can we have standardized laptop motherboard form factors? Like ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX but laptop. That would be so awesome.
OMG he is still using Note 9, can't complain though, it's a beauty!
About time you covered framework
So I'm pretty sure we crashed the website
Looks like Linus broke the Framework website! :D
It is gonna be cool if they will launch 2 in 1 version of it.
If I had any free money, I would by it just to support them!
Damn. I've been on the fence about putting in an order for WEEKS now, and now that this video has dropped, the site is just completely swamped. Looks like I shouldn't have sat on my butt for so long.
if this laptop is in my region, I'm so grabbing it. I support this move
With an Ryzen 5000 I buy it instantly
buying one rn
This dude in a fucking mask still.... smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
Linus' phone is totally busted and is just a cut waiting to happen - not surprised in the slightest. I'll never understand people who don't use phone cases, especially if they are as clumsy as he is.
3D PRINT YOUR OWN LAPTOP CASE! Altho, I have a bad feeling about this company feels like they wont last very long especially their business model does not work.
I've been using Fairphone 3 for 6 months now and don't have much to complain. Yes, it has mid range specs at best, but it does everything a phone needs to do, and I dont have to be afraid of breaking components since they offer replacement modules. As far as I can tell, they do not provide schematics to repair the individual modules, but Fairphone 3 is by far the most repairable usable phone on the market. They also promote the possibility to use alternative os'es to Android such as /e/ OS and Lineage. I'd love to see you cover the phone rather than sligthly ridiculing it.
9:30 you put the antenas the wrong way? black to white? wtf :P
I’m thinking about how amazing solutions like these would be to businesses. That’s potentially another massive market Frameworks could tackle.
right to repair done RIGHT!
This would probably be the only laptop i would ever buy willingly
I love this! Framework, great job!
LTT just crashed their website I think, lol! I was trying to configure a model and the website went down.
making me wait for this how dare
Linus is so head ass 😂
ur late
If this company still exists in 2 years I'm 100% buying one.
Framework website crashed :/  Hug of death
I love the concept, but I couldn't do it, personally. I'd want to have all of the different modules with me "just in case" and that feels more cumbersome than just taking what works with my IO... lol
I was just thinking of this kind of thing yesterday.  I was using my old laptop from 1998 and plugged in a WIFI card into one of the PCMCIA slots.  That made me think, why don't we bring this back in a more modern form.  That could solve the dongle hell we're currently in, by letting us add whatever ports we need.
This video gives me anxiety . Every time he lifts the laptop up I freak out !!
11:54 Linus.exe stoppes working
I'm 17, at the moment I'm unemployed. I'm using an hp dv6 laptop from 2011. As soon as I get a job I'm buying this thing! Holy crap, this is the laptop I've always wanted but never had 😍
Libri boot it
that battery option should be in every single laptop in the world
Linus tech ads
Linus must use linux 😂 never go for windows when working on upgradable laptops
Will it Hackintosh?
This is the direction all laptop manufacturers should go. Would increase spare part market, and reduce e-waste. I hope this is successful so that others join bandwagon. Edit: OS like linux and Windows should also have native driver support for these components.
''Can i take a moment to appeciate the one non-modular bit of i/o is a headphone jack'' ''Heck Yeah'' YES
I go to their website and it's down darn
id be into it if they had ryzen processors, hope they get some soon
If i wasn't on macos i'd get this.
I'm very pleased that "phone block" idea is still in the air and google didint killed "moduler  product" idea completely.
I find this concept so awesome that I immediately watched the whole video again. And the video is so much fun, also because Linus is so genuinely excited about it.
If they put a decent graphics card in it I'll buy it IMMEDIATELY
Apple be like, "Buy our new fully upgradable i-mac starting just at 4000$" each module  comes separately and each cost 1000$ in total you need 20 module at least to turn our i-mac on at lowest possible Performance
I never wanted to get a Laptop because if anything is broken you are pretty much fcked but this thing is just great!
Ok I love this company now if I was not a kid and help them in some way I would lmao this is soooo fricking cool
I’ll sign up when they make a model with a gpu
Well it seems like their site has been having problems for hours. I was on it for a bit, but it was VERY slow, and eventually crashed. I came back to check the comments and from 3 hours ago, they said the site was crashed. lmao gotta love it
These people should join the Linus Tech family. :P They seem so sweet. If anything goes wrong for them, Linus would totally help. :P
I can't remember the last time I saw Linus so excited! Like a child on Christmas morning...
Perfect laptop to learn about compiuters ;)
Linus broke the site!!!
REFRESHING. good to know the tech industry isn’t completely leaving us in the dust
„saughtered“
This is wild, I love it. And wow, right as I was still wondering about compatibility with Linux Linus goes and mentions this at 12:44 I love this PC, what an absolute trooper. Hats off to them
So, a repairable/upgradable laptop with 0 compromises? Holy fk
I'm confused. My Dell XPS 15 has two Type A USB ports. One on each side.
one of the only things that I could see being a problem with this is that waterproofing is near impossible. The thing is though I don't use laptops like I use smartphones. Laptops are usually in my LAP, and my doesn't tend to get wet. Not since grade school atleast...
it fills me with anxiety the way linus manhandle that laptop with his trackrecord
If I was able to, I would have founded them for their work and to support them even When I Dont Even Use A Laptop. Passion for work, care from their product and care from customer support deserve some love. I dont think anyone would even mind if they charge a bit more.
I would definitely come back for a bigger one with a  discrete gpu.
maybe when they do an amd system i'll consider this.. it looks like a great idea.
If you have some parts from an older laptop (not too old), these things seem way too cheap for the kind of performance you can get. Nice
ngl. I really want one even though I doing need it. Really awesome product and I hope LTT gave this company the boost they need to make sure this product does well long term
HOW DOES THIS EVEN HAVE 1 DISLIKE  Small tears came to my eyes by the time he got to the colored gd screws I mean jfc this is just AWESOME
This is defenetly going to be my next laptop
this is just great. love it.
Here's to hoping that the version 2 has Ryzen 6000 and USB4. I'd pay an unreasonable price for that.
Linus, apparently the unattended drivers installation is enterprises reserved, some do have unattended driver installers but people prefer to run a interactive one for whatever reason
If nintendo from 2008 made a laptop today
Gaming pc with hot swappable GPUs etc also upgradable screen more more MOOOREE!!
Aaaand immediately their website is being hugged to death 😂
Way too few slots for such single port modules..imho the usb port modules should be at least dual port. And charge port should not take up a module.
Bought.
Best feature IMO: Less eWaste
The razer blade stealth has a pretty easy to replace battery, I know because I replaced it
We as a community need to get behind this.  Imagine if laptops became just as modular as a desktop.
I absolutely love this
This is a product that needs to be hyped up like crazy. Cause it is definitely worth it! Haven't been excited for a tech product for quite a while now. Kudos to Framework for creating a banger of a product. This needs to be shared to show traditional manufacturers that we now know its definitely possible for a laptop like this to exist. Damn I'm way too excited for this! Let's go!!
looks like you crashed their web site lol
i find some decisions on the laptop a bit weird, like how (until now) you dont have a dual usb c adapter, so it will in total 4 ports which is really limiting (imo) and you cant have a gpu so it would have been nice to include thunderbolt ports (atleast on one side) for real future proofing.   but honestly, this thing is a great product and it should shake the industry at least a little. its not just the product itself, but the company philosophy too. try finding a replacement for your laptops camera. try finding one for cheap from official sources, modern laptop makers have a billion variants of any laptop line that makes it all so hard to find, and if you do find replacement parts they come at extraorbitant prices, and then when its time to replace the part, even skilled and certified technician can break your device ( happened to me, thanks HP for breaking my display and full  case when all you had to do was to replace a hinge......)
Hey, Im just here to mention it, their website and configurator are now completley on fire probably because everyone now is configurating and ordering. I hope there is a V2 in the works somehow with Ryzen CPUs. Cant wait for such an amazing future with more of these modular laptops <3
I really love this, I went straight to there website just to look at pricing (there design and ethos is right up there with the best off them)
This laptop is awsome.
I wish there was a config with core i3 11th gen, 8gb ram and 512gb
Think that their webpage is having a bit of a "to many people at once" issue right now 🤣
Unclear, does linus understand Apple and Sony are in a perpetual state of gas lighting now?
their website has way to much traffic now, llt version of ddos
funny its not 749 like shown in the website for the base model
I was taking a look at their website and thought, would it be even cheaper if they sold and OS-less version of the laptop? Because I suppose part of the price I'm paying is for windows, and I'm comfortable with installing pop os on it or something
It’s sad laptop CPU’s aren’t upgradable anymore
I think Framework’s website has literally died after this video; won’t load for me 😂😂
I still find the activate windows funny. I know why you do it and I saw the video before about all the keys you have. Just still funny
Ok I will be looking forward to getting mine.
This laptop is amazing I would love one that offers a great deal of longevity since it's a Hassel always having to move your data to a new product
FINALLY
This must be a fantastic combo with Linux onboard. Hope that developers will do something on their side to increase compatibility so that Linux runs smoothly on their hardware.
Without a socketed CPU, this isn't really that much more repairable than other laptops on the market.
if my m1 macbook die's this is going to be my next laptop.
I'm calling it now: The entire Framework staff is going to be assassinated and their offices firebombed by the entire PC component industry before 2022.  This goes against everything they and their shareholders stand for.
This has me sold on it
Their site is lagging because of many people loading it :D it shows it's under maintenance!
Now with a GPU model... :) Then all set and hope when you do need an upgrade you don't have to buy a whole new thing...
you know the product is promising when the site literally stops working after an ltt video
Holy shit, this is such a beautiful product. I like the concept so much and been waiting for something like this to come along.
Lol framework site down, probably from all the web traffic after this video
sounds very interesting, i hope they survive multiple generations and adopt more than just intel soon, as well as offer other screen options. if they get enough publicity, and your fantastic video definitely shows the laptop in a very good light, hopefully enough people will decide to adopt it, instead of sticking with the use it and toss it, so many people have gotten used to over the years.
Huhum... Gaming or just high end version? And yeah touchscreen. Make retro connectors and turn it into a mini arcade laptop etc. Unlimited infinite ideas and possibilities!! I would love that!!🚀
Just how I like my software, modular!
1. OMG engineered for the end-user, with longevity in mind (and it did look gorgeous) 2. The way you are holding it (Linus) 😨 3. Intentionally upgradeable in 2021 🤯 (with collaboration from other manufacturers) ♥️♥️♥️
If I had £1000 I’d 100% invest in this
I pray people buy these. I feel like it will go along way to help the right to repair argument.
Lmaooo so many people went to their website and now it’s down
Lovely piece of tech!
This is beautiful. I really want this to be the way that tech goes in the future.
i heard about this 2 weeks ago - i love it and i hope this company makes it because this laptop will be just like the others if they go out of business
This reminds me of a crossing between old 2010 era ThinkPads and MacBooks... wait... 3:03 Ohh, it makes a lot more sense now.
I am 100% here for products like this!
Jesus, been trying for a few hours now to pre-order the win pro model, and site keeps crashing, lol.  Guess I'll wait for the second gen version with better parts available
Can you game on it?
When you get a laptop that you can *potentially* replace the motherboard on
I don't think the "battery disconnect" function is that, usually it means when you do it the system then powers down and you can then "safely" remove the battery, but when you power it on again it'll reattach the battery, it's a thing for maintenance.  Very cool with the modules tho, even if some of it is still not that "un-modular" on say, the latest Lenovo T series Thinkpads.
Its like they told the engineering department to have fun instead of giving them unreasonable requirements!
Fry's use to have an in-store built laptop that was upgradeable . We got our first laptop there many years ago . I upgraded the socket 478 Celeron to a desktop P4 , no bios upgrade needed . Only thing not upgradable was the video . Ended up selling it to my sister , where she used it daily at her business until she finally killed it . The exhaust fans finally gave out , allowing the P4 to slowly cook the system ...
Looks like an amazing incredible product!!!
What would be SICK is that for future model they keep a same profile size and identifcal motherboard, only with different specs, and also sell the mobos seperatly so that way if you got an older model you aren t forced to get the new one but can just buy the new motherboard and replace your oldy with it, effectively switching your cpu n' shit
Less E-waste is always great
Anyone else nervous when Linus kept swinging that laptop around with one hand? I was just waiting for him to drop it at some point. He has a reputation to keep after all.😅
Building your own laptop… now that’s something I’d like to see
I want one...
Now that's a laptop I'd actually buy and not feel bad about it.
I combined my desktop's ability to power on AC power with an Alexa enabled plug and I just tell Alexa to turn on my plug and in turn turning on my desktop
For the future I hope they use a Free and open source BIOS for this laptop like System76 are doing.
It's been 3 hours and their website is still bogged down by too many visitors. We are giving them the hug of death!
Now that's a laptop that I thought all laptops should of been to begin with, I hope to god other companies start doing the same and keep it unified no proprietary bullshit
I was shocked at the affordability
I really like the concept and would consider buying one, but the glossy screen instantly disqualifies this laptop for me. The glossy screen is the first I look for and the hardest argument against a laptop for me. I use my laptop a lot on the go and a glossy screen is just the worst thing you can have for that...
We need companies like these, I hope they stand by their word and make it big, definitely a company I'm considering for the future.   Other companies have decided that they know what is best for us(themselves), we need companies like this to disruptively and discordantly shove it up those mega manufacturers asses. I truly hope they succeed and will support if I can.
It's a cool idea but it does sort of feel like they're trying to create their own little monopoly and I'm thinking parts will be VERY expensive for it, getting much, much more expensive the higher end you get. You'd have to figure out if it's worth it to buy new parts for a closed platform that you can only get parts for from the manufacturer or just get a new laptop everytime yours starts to malfunction.
Linus making this video broke their website. 🤣
They don't want you to repair or upgrade they want you to buy a new one
Love the concept, hopefully, it doesn't die in the next 5 years. That dont "trust the user" to repair point cant be made by Linus tho, altho knowledgeable he constantly breaks things, imagine people with zero knowledge contacting support cause they screwed something up.
i have waited for this for most of my life
If I didn't just buy a GPD Win3 and had some use for an actual laptop, I'd definitely grab this.
Don't forget, they also have plans to allow you to install an open-source BIOS on it (coreboot)!
Jesus Christ, im reading the comments and already invested in the company
That headphone jack is a requrirement not an option lol
7:33 lol not really an issue using wired things i still do just because don't want stuff i need like a mouse or head phones dying on me when im gaming
I would love a 2 in 1 Framework
Now I will pay 50 usd for a firewire expansion for my camcorder needs
Standardize laptop motherboard plz.
I think this review just caused frame.work a hug of death.
"The Dell's not even f*cking thinner!" had me legit rolling
God I want one
Their website has been hugged to death lol
aaaanddd the website is down..
This looks almost the same (in the upgradability and repairability standpoint) as my old 2014 HP Elitebook 15 inch that i got for 115 euros more than a year ago. Except here it seems like you cant really upgrade the cpu which is a bummer.
Upgradable laptop example-e6530: 2 Mini PCIe with 3 antenna wires for Centrino 6300, full mini PCIe, UJ262/272 bluray drives, and easy access SATA port along with DDR memory access. That upgradable for ya, it certainly is for me. I can't wait to use my mSATA SSDs.
this is literally the linux of laptops, thats amazing
I are mechanocal enginar at Appel I dazigne coomsuner lelectronix my favoritest assembly method is glue because its modern and makes me feel funny to huff
This is so cool!!!   Hopefully they will do a surface-like device. Surface Pros are currently propably the most popular devices for everyday use as a student (at my university) because of the pen support and great portability. With the affordable price, great company ethics and slightly nerdy aura it would definitely be a top seller for that target group.
Somewhat reminds me of the DIY Gaming Laptop from OCZ, circa 2008. Very similar concept.
I know what my next laptop will be. This puppy. I would buy it only for the fun of putting it together myself. Too bad the Fairphone is so expensive, or else I would buy that, too. Oh and of course, both will be using Linux. I really hope we get to a point where you can game on Linux just as well as on Windows, and also have the same experience with a Linux phone OS as with Android. I've been holding off on buying a new phone for some time now, because it's so hard to find reasonably sized phones these days, they often have an overloaded OS with lots of stuff added on by the hardware manufacturer, and phones have also gotten more expensive.
I am really trying to think of an excuse to buy one...
Wait, you gotta buy a USB-C expansion that connects to the laptop via USB-C... In order to charge the battery via USB-C. Okay.
I love this.  I got on their email list months ago.  If they had been available earlier this year when my 2012 repeatedly-upgraded ASUS laptop finally died, I would have bought from them.  I'm also looking forward to a RISC-V laptop since I only let Linux run on the bare hardware.
WHY ISN'T EVERY LAPTOP LIKE THAT!
If I had money I'd buy this outa  Principle
Imagine if it had an upgradable gpu…. The onboard display can stay as-is, because external high refresh DP monitor when gaming…
Perfect company!!!
This is ideal for fleet laptops that can easily fixed or upgraded by the IT department.
15:10 pls become a meme
Is it just me or do ads no longer show on the timeline for any YouTubers? Cause I know some that are never demonetized yet there is no yellow mark where an ad should be...
if this thing becomes competitiv, im gonna buy that
A great example of this being a lie: the surface laptop 3. The previous 2 were a glued together nightmare where to open the device you needed to destroy the entire palmrest. The designers said they simply weren't willing to compromise on feel and appearance. And then with version 3, they changed the device to use screws and be user serviceable with zero compromises because everyone complained.
I have a Dell Inspiron with the i7-1165G7, and it has the wireless on a separate card, but it will only boot with designated wireless cards installed, so no upgrade for me.  If I had known this was coming, I would have waited the 7 months using my old i5-5200U laptop and gotten this.
Until CPU and GPU are upgradeable, it's not truely upgradable IMO  Though I guess you can swap it out with a newer motherboard, but that significantly increases the costs than just buying a sole CPU/GPU
I've been waiting for you to do an episode on the Fairphone for 4 years. Can you please give it more than a less-than-a-second screenshot?
I thought regardless of the size of the display if it was 30/40 pin it would just work. So you could just order a screen that has the correct pins with whatever features you want.
I mean ... it's nice that they have a thin and light design option ... but where's my chonkers option for gaming?  With modular bays for GPU?  And cooler swaps?  And such.  It's a great start, but I want to see this go soooo much further.  Reminds me of the old PCMCIA days when you could just swap laptop parts.  But smaller!  It's about freaking time!  Honestly, not gonna lie, I'm kind of surprised that they haven't done more with m.2 slots for various components.  I mean ... USB works ... I guess.  But...
This should be the ideal platform for a Linux laptop. Any thoughts from Anthony?
If it gets RGB, I'll be sold
upgradable RAM?! even most laptops that are NOT entry level come with soldered RAM and if you're lucky they'll give a SODIMM slot
Honestly, this seems like an awesome product, hoping they grow big
Regarding not being able to upgrade the CPU: Could they not provide a replacement motherboard/CPU pair in future?
Not being able to swap processors is a bit of a bummer but this looks awesome. Hope it takes off, it really needs to be mainstream.
Man this is my next laptop once they start producing
I honestly love the idea behind this laptop. I've been a supporter of right to repair for a long time. These guys are doing it right. If one of their products ever meets my use case, I'll be getting one. Unfortunately right now an ultrabook isn't in the right fit for me.  Hey Framework! Make a gaming laptop with a replaceable GPU board and I'd happily pay a premium for it.
Is it just me or isn’t a bigger form factor laptop better. More space for what you need. And got reparable parts. I always think I’m gonna break modern laptops.
https://youtu.be/0rkTgPt3M4k?t=245  If you remove the parts...and re-screw it...you'll always have extra screws.
Anybody notice that inbuilt camera is so good 🔥
You Voice is so Irritating
If this was around about a year back when i got my System 76 Laptop i dont know which one i would choose.
I am sold as well, I hope they can ship to Europe, I want to support that company and what they are doing.
Would love to see more companies like this! Love seeing a movement towards right to repair and accessibility to upgradeability.
Linus, please be nice with the laptop.
If Apple made this laptop, the QR codes would only be readable by Genius Bar employees and just mentioning you saw one of the QR codes would void your warranty.
This gives me vibes of what a Thinkpad could've been.
This is frigging amazin
I have a Lenovo which has problems with it's wifi. So I bought a new wifi module that supports 5Ghz. I swapped it into the laptop and a message pops up saying it's not an authorised part. The only way to get around this issue is to desolder a flash chip, read the bios, send it to some people on a forum who will unlock it and send it back, reflash, resolder it using a reflow station.
8:16 Oh thank god I though I was on the wrong chanel
Now that’s a company we should support
I love it
What about the GPU?
My dell latidute and ibm thinkpad has swapable CPU's, sure they are acient these days(core2duo and first gen i5's), but still.
I think this video broke their webpage lol
If they can do a version with dedicated GPU I'm sold, don't care if it's fatter
Wait did we crash their site? Seeing "something went wrong" on every page.  Come on framework, I'm looking to get a laptop for some kids so let me consider this.
if i could like this video 50 times i would !  about time everyone ditched the non upgradeable glued together crap, and thought about trying to save the planet ?
Holy shit this seems perfect. I want it so bad.
USB 4 is when this modular laptop technology is going to really take off. I'm 100% on board to buy a laptop from them if it has USB 4 on one or two slots by the time I need a new laptop (which won't be for a couple years).
The "they got a strong framework" line absolutely killed me lol
love it, hope they are still around when my thinkpad finaly fails on me :D
why would i have a steam library on this machine?
You lightly shook it and it didn't warp, maybe this "thin" laptop is on to something.
didn't go into much detail on what IO options there are, looks like a great product.
I have 0 uses for a laptop and will argue for the regular usage at home person to get a desktop they can upgrade, but I want this because I CAN upgrade it and they can partner with DBrand
500 Internal Server Error If you are the administrator of this website, then please read this web application's log file and/or the web server's log file to find out what went wrong.
ok, these guys could seriously get away with doing a mini pc with that mobo and those modules. and then have an optical bay that can do either optical storage, extra drive space, or a gpu.
Already order6one as well.
Once they have gaming ones where you can upgrade GPU modules... then they'll sell like hell!
But wait... does it have captive screws?!
Website is down
Wait DELL wanted to make an USER FRIENDLY UPGRADABLE laptop!? And now they are screwing the cpu cooler in the freaking case? What!?
now i want **LOUIS** to give his opinion on this
if all companies do this will be more profit for them as customer be more likely to buy part from them
I wish my laptop was like this because my headphone jack is messed up
Ive never been interested in laptops...... until now!!!
Once again LTT breaks a website immediately after showcasing a product.
If they come up with a modular gaming laptop i will buy that shit immediately.
8:18 linus drop tips
Just tried to order one, no joy…. Hopefully will be able to put an order in soon, but after this vid went live: I’m thinking gonna be awhile 😅🤦🏼
I also prefer wired devices to wireless ones cuz I hate recharging. I only use wireless mouse when I go out with my laptop.
I bet anything you want that this is the Last time we hear about this laptop.
You know a computer is good when linus trys to buy one.
Wow it's a nice reminder of how things should be
I believe I found my next laptop.
Dell, HP, Sony and the rest of the manufacturers, TAKE NOTE!
We need this in India!
Aaaaaaand. You crashed their website. Looks really good.
I am ordering one, and if they are as nice as you say, I am using them for my business
Old Lenovo’s are still the best for this kind of thing. I got a free Thinkpad a few months ago, fixed the hinge, and upgraded it for less than $100. Still decent though for this
This vid went live, and almost immediately the Frame Work ordering server is overwhelmed.  This shows what people want in a laptop!     I'm waiting for the site to get back online and then i'll order mine.
Me: watches a linus video youtube: before you start, would you like a linus ad?
11:52 - I had to go back 5-6 times to this part! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
dell: USB type-A? best i can do is type C framework: u want USB type A or C? or HDMI *OR BOTH* ?
I have been watching this group of engineers for about half year, unfortunately I live on disability income of less than 8k a year so this will sadly be another product I will miss out on. BUT I LOVE IT!
if only Every laptop was like this. Linus, you are the best
Yes!
LTT whats is the best Gaming Laptop for Students right now? Because idk on what i should spend my safed money
Oooooooooo it even comes with a screwdriver
This is a step in the right direction. Next, they need to make an upgradable 17 inch laptop with upgradable CPU and GPU modules! It's possible...
Yeah it needs a AMD option at the very least at the same time with a touchscreen release. I am waiting for order in europe
This is how things should be, this is how things could be.
Is this a German company? Because this screams German engineering
The upgrade thing is not the biggest sell for me. The amount of laptops I've seen where liquid spills have fried the motherboard, rendering everything else e-waste. If you're lucky enough to find a replacement motherboard great. But then you have to factor in someone's time to fit it. And even then there is no guarantee it will work again. Being able to swap out a laptop motherboard easily is a complete game changer. Even if you have to switch the CPU too. It is still more cost effective than buying a new laptop.
Site is literally down right now lol. Went to go deposit and I guess others did too
After years of watching laptop reviews I can finally say, "I want this laptop!!!!"
Well first good news in 2 years is a laptop build with brains.... what does this say about the world we live in...
If they had GPU options, I'd buy one in a heartbeat!
Yeah, well... Good idea and all, it looks very promising on paper, as long as they expand their stock to include not only I/O modules and keyboards, but screens and whole motherboards/cpus as units too. That's the main thing missing from laptops. In most laptops you can still change ram/storage/wifi, like Linus said. Tbh, it looks like a kickstarter campaign thing. I would be EXTREMELY cautious about this. Red flags popping up already..  No shipping to the EU.  Site is broken, it redirects you to the main page as soon as you go in to configure your DIY laptop.
Im buying one
Best Notebook I have ever saw, if I hadn´t bought one last year, I would go for this no questions asked.
15:20 Linus, you  mean ... like this?  https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07JPYF22G
AMD Ryzen CPU/APU and two M.2 sockets (or add a SATA bay)  please.  Also RJ45 Ethernet module maybe? This will be my next laptop, but NOT with an Intel processor.  I'm waiting for an AMD APU from them.
now this  is a laptop.
Real potential here is longevity. Imagine if company stays afloat for 20-30 years and you could still have the original laptop up and running all decent with the occasional upgrades for this or that. 10 years for a laptop is fine now, but that limit should be pushed way further. If this still exists and gets good updates 5 years from now, it will be disruptive.
Please please techies with expendable money and also those who are in the market for a new laptop, buy this so it becomes a standard and we can get repairability and upgradeability back!
Wow that's amazing! I want one... but why don't they sell them with AMD CPU's? And why was the GPU not mentioned at all in the video? Edit: Oh lol nvm it's an Intel GPU, no thanks. Also a bit disappointing that you can't swap up the trackpad for something more useful, like a second (touch-)screen for example. Hopefully they'll make a module where there's a wide touchscreen at the top and the keyboard at the bottom (like on the Zephyrus Duo). I also don't like that it looks like a Macbook, hopefully they'll make black or dark grey parts as well.
I’m terrified of the cost, not because its not worth it but just because my Wife’s going to see it on our bank statement
This is their first step. In the future they'll have several screens to choose from, CPU chips you can swap out, maybe even mobile GPUs, so for a few generations they can continue to use the same motherboard, afterwards, when a new generation needs a better mother board, easy upgrade.   I love this.
This is how everything should be made...
I thought I was subscribed to you but I wasn't until now xd
repairibility>elegance still for me. even though i don't like laptops because i have floorspace but this looks interesting.
00:40 In a post-pandemic world it will be normal for an ad-segment to buy it instead of getting paid.
Meanwhile somewhere in Dell's HQ there's an engineer working on soldering  nvma and RAM to the processor while the marketing guy gets a raise over the innovative new 2022 SKU.
Oh no! went to website to check it out and it appears we've given it the hug of death lol
A ryzen model would be amazing and also end of life chuck it into a 3d printed box and make an emulation machine haha
Is it only a 13,5” 🙈
I'm in...if their website works!
I dreamed about the "run on adapter and not use battery" feature for years and thank god someone else also thought about it.
Are they not up and running et? I went to the website and almost every page is broken.
this is what im talking about this is rights to repair
Also - if they find a way add a trackpoint option - every thinkpad fan will be lining up.
Website is busted lol
If I were going to buy a laptop, this would be the one. And I mean, "The One" like f-cking Neo.
you should make a video sponsored by ifixit where you fix the back of your phone
Why is their website is borked?
were do i buy it?
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how amazing the webcam feed quality is 😍?
If only their website worked properly...
1:30 Correction "Greed, profits, and planned obsolescence"
Bro life is really fucking me in the ass right now, and I just want to thank you guys for continuing to make videos. They all help me take my mind off of the shit going on in my life.  Never stop.
FINALLY ! The end of look for real sutainability and personalisation ? Maybe and it's great ! I think to many folks are going to their website, it is impossible to accees the order page x)
6:30, almost sold...
Amazing producttt
i'm sold
I think their website is down...
I hope they get the success they deserve with this laptop. They did an absolute terrific job in designing this.
is there a gfaphics card and can up upgrade so you don"t have to buy a new gaming labtop every 2 or 3 years.
I first learned about this company about 1.5 months ago when I saw a video of their CEO demo this laptop and talk about the company and I immediately decided my next laptop will be a Framework. It's a no brainer. I hope Framework eats Apple's and all PC's lunch.
OMG. I LOVE THESE PEOPLE.
We need companies like framework or giants corpos will take our rights through convincing us by saying: that is a cost of improvement. Framework just took those philosophy and threw it into apple and microsofts face :D
They totally missed an opportunity to use an MXM type discrete GPU. They really need to get around the problem of upgrading GPUs at the very least for this concept to work long term.
Holy shit, this thing is amazing
Still lacks support for cpu & gpu change, but it's a nice step on the right direction.
website down cuz everyone is checkin them out :D
This laptop could be an excellence choice for Business that hand these out to their employees. They can issue out more tech refreshes every year and can perform in-house repairs instead of relying on a 3rd party. Much cheaper in the long run, I hope more people are onboard with this company.
So their website appears to have gone down... can't help but wonder if their traffic ahs exploded since this video :)
I think this video got them so much attention their site crashed lol
imma invest in it too... ngl i enjoyed it if they can deliver
Waiting for release and more reviews... But this looks reallllly good
I have never owned a laptop, I'm a desktop dude, but if I EVER wanted one, this is it, without a doubt!
This is so good
if they ever make a phone i'm getting one.
Damn, if I get a laptop for myself (I'm currently only using my work laptop) I'll definitely buy this one. and I'll probably recommend to my boss that we get this ones when we need to upgrade (although I live in Argentina so that may be a problem, but I'll still try)
hahaha @11:50 LOOOOL
They site literally crashed
I haven't seen him excited about a product in years...
Now, Framework needs to hit up the gaming PC market!
Framework battles for the user!  Edit: Linus we broke their site, they did not expect our power
The only thing left is for them to come up with motherboard+cpu+gpu upgradability. If they can come up with a way, that is gonna be a killer feature. I'm not surprised if they're thinking or even working on it right now. I'm actually surprised they haven't gone with AMD APUs yet though I suspect it might have to do with Thunderbolt 4.
It appears that we crashed their site
Apart from IO modules it is a regular laptop from 10 yeas ago... Modular-vs-proprietary discussion in tech and automotive swings back and forth like flared-vs-skinny jeans in fashion, and I trully love how it turns out now
Not available in Germany 😢
I'm fucking buying one. I don't even need another laptop that bad but I want to support this type of movement in the industry.
I'm sold
4:41 Pretty sure it's the *sponsor* that *bough* the segway...
Nice ultra book version. Now we need the thiiiicc version with full fat components ;)
I think you broke their website.  Getting errors trying to configure laptop.
This video would have been a lot better if you just left apple out of it. Everyone knows what they're getting into when they buy apple, no need to bring it up in every video you make.
"casually I bought one" is the same energy LLT equivalent of a Chad flexin with a red bull cocktail in one hand, a bro tank on, and aviators about to go steal ur girl
“It’s like ultrabook sexy thing” 1 inch thick…
3d print case and modding e boom amazing personalizatim notebook
these guys r harry potter and i love them
Daaaang, the website went down, up, down, up again, and finally it is down with a 500 server error. Traffic to the site must be insane!
Done, sold! Now how is their customer service?
Linus "The Dell's not even fucking thinner!" Sebastian   I hope this company makes it and gets to make many more generations, very good first effort
We seem to have given them the hug of death
16:20 thats the extreme case of what happens, the main thing that leaving your battery 100% charged all the time does is decrease capacity quickly
Attempting to explore the configuration options for either pre-built or DIY on their website: "We're sorry, but something went wrong." Apparently they do not want our money that bad. AMAZING concept, and something I would be more than interested in.
11:52
Woah
Wow, This might be the best laptop on the LTT channel.
to bad the screen is small and it's intel they should defenetly launch a pc/console with steam os 3.0
Literally the first "different" laptop what I am really interested to buy
RIP framework's website just got nuked with visitors 😂
With motherboard replacements and different CPU and GPU. And a full schematics . I suggest a rename (with his permission)  to "Rossmann Dream"  :)
But can u watercool it?
there is one think that is stoping me from buying this think. Im a gamer and i want a Nvida GPU in my new laptop so i can game on it in my free time. I wold even pay like 1500 Euro if i get a 3060 in this laptop. Maby do a bigger one for gamer with an GPU i wanna work at day and play at night.
My next laptop.
I thought Linus keeps all the products he reviews, at least most of them.
As soon as you mentioned being surprised they have a *canadian site* I literally felt happy ... seriously, any kind of cool or niche stuff almost *never* is shippable or purchasable in Canada *cough* Fairphone for example *cough*
Holy shit this is exciting!!!
I have been dreaming about systems like this for years. And other IT people have always shouted me down whenever i mentioned it.  I am in between contracts right now..but as soon as I can afford one, I'm buying it!
I think their servers crashed after this video lol
This all sounds good, but you know the big guys (Dell, Apple, etc) are going to go to war against them because they make so much money on the service side.  I wouldn't be surprised to see lawsuits filed to prevent Framework from building or selling their product once people find out about it.  Some lawyer somewhere will find a loophole that allows the big guys to totally shut Framework down and we will be back to non upgradable non repairable laptops again.  I would buy one of these if I thought that the existing manufacturers would allow Framework to survive.
Anyone seeing the "We're sorry, but something went wrong" after clicking on the "Configure Now" on the DYI Edition? I'd love to support this company.
And who keeps hidden input "authenticity_token" in a html form...
Tried to go and look at preorders, and part of their site seems overloaded lol
The great thing about this is that the end-user doesn't even need the technical know-how to benefit. Having a laptop break and being able to get it repaired for <$100 is pretty nice.
Never been so sold on a product by watching a review, great product and great review. Very excited for the future of this company, hope they can stick around.
The Dell I knew and loved died in 2013 [*] R.i.P
The idea is great but the product is already a flop people who want to DIY or repair their laptops.. DO NOT use a CPU graphics lmao.. And most high-end laptops allow you to upgrade the CPU and even GPU.
This laptop has a better front camera than my phone 🤒
Belgium, Europe, please!
I think the best bit they have going for them WRT customers coming back is that they are not trying to lock you into their ecosystem via shady tactics and proprietary gear, but instead just offering a great product that makes me want to buy the other modules and customisations that they offer.
This is exactly what we need. I love what framework is doing. I’ve been using a thinkpad t430 though and it’s pretty expandable. It’s not as expandable and thin as this but it’s good at everything else
Why does he always say segway when he gets sponsered
Damn that webcam is the best I have seen on a laptop. Also, partnering up with companies for custom chassis and keyboard designs would be amazing for consumers
Linus borked the website lol
Guess you crashed the buy page. :D
XRPPPPPP
but why the shitty glossy display? why? otherwise, i'd buy this with no hesitation.
I love that there's companies willing to go this far to create a consumer friendly product, I can only hope this becomes a hot trend.
ewww a mouse user
Linus most of the Clevo type laptops (XMG etc) you have reviewed have a lot of the same ideas in them. They come with full manuals for taking apart the machine. They have upgradability inside and you can replace keyboards, displays, ram, wifi, battery etc. Also, everyone I have seen selling these items don't void the warranty if you open it up. I ordered an XMG Apex 15 just recently and opened it up to add more storage to it and it was just a few screws I had to open and just slotted the drives in.   I think this kind of stuff you show here and in the Clevo laptops should be pretty much bare minimum acceptable standards with right to repair.
Their website is back up ! get your orders in quick !
Man i've been watching Linus for so long now and this is easily in the top 5 most positive reviews from the guy.
This is a laptop i really want.
Loving the idea
WOW ... maybe my next laptop... thanks Framework for making it, thank LMG for the showcase... any AMD in the future?
Would love the adding of usb-c for charging that isnt required an expansion card to use properly.
Just tried going to their page to order one, and the website isn't working. Just great. Guess I won't order one after all.
I really want this to work. Imagine if it becomes something so profitable that it becomes a standard for other companies to follow.
I know what I'm buying!
Yaaaa I'm going to buy This
Feels so good to see something like this get off the ground. As someone who doesn't like Macbooks and isn't used to paying Apple price tags though, I gotta wait for them to release a model that can support GPU integration. The idea of not being able to stably run GPU-heavy software on a laptop that can cost as much as 1.4 grand is just kinda eye-watering.
I’ll stick to my thinkpad , thanks
Ah yes, custom laptop keyboard
Curious enough all of the other reviews including this doesn't have any performance test?
Let's hope this company gets to work on a phone!
Technically 100 degrees is ok? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
the moment the site comes back up I'm ordering a bunch for my company. I'm done with Apple's trash. Serious, F Apple.
Their website is working weird.  When I click configure laptop button: it takes me to a page with a button that says choose laptop and clicking that takes me to page that has a button that says configure laptop and clicking that takes me to page that has a button that  says choose laptop and clicking that takes me to page that has a button that says configure laptop and clicking that takes me to page that has a button that says choose laptop  and clicking that takes me to page that has a button that says configure laptop and clicking that takes me to page that has a button that says choose laptop and clicking that takes me to page that has a button that says configure laptop and clicking that takes me to page that has a button that says choose laptop and clicking that takes me to page that has a button that says configure laptop and clicking that takes me to page that has a button that says choose laptop
My worry is that they are not going to stay profitable, that is sustainable, against companies that use cheaper assembly methods and have economy of scale in their pockets
15:40 next LTT fab project. Alex, get on it.
Linus killed the website.
If they produce one with Ryzen i will for sure sell my piece of crap Alienware and buy a Framework no doubt about it
Lol I love it, probably I save money to buy  one of this when my actual laptop die
shouldve had the framework to handle us all. can't even check it out
AMAZING! Too bad the websites broke already.
Can you change the GPU or add one?
okay linus just crash their website wow
Their website has currently crashed from everyone trying to pre-order it. My self included was going to put down a deposit after seeing how game changing this is.
Sounds great! But is it only me or is the Website still under construction?  Lot of false hyperlinks etc.
This is literally legos for techos - love it
Wow. Blown away at how well they have pulled this off
Website link doesn’t work
I will wait to see how to company goes for 1 or 2 years, and will definitely buy one
Next laptop FOR SURE. Update: I ORDERED ONE!
i fucking cried at the end of this video man so amazing to see a change coming with linux and companies like this getting a huge push right now, fuck microsoft
im getting one
I still miss my chonky 17" MacBook Pro. Almost everything was user replaceable.  How does it GAME?  A true game changer would be where u can upgrade the GPU independently of the logic board.  I would like to see a thicker version so I can have a longer lasting battery or at least a "Battery Dock" that you slap on the bottom for that extra juice.  My main issue is that I still prefer macOS over Windows.  Sorry Microsoft but Windows 10 is just a jumbled mess with issues all the time.  I periodically have to completely wipe my boot drive due to some "update" completely borking the boot where it can't load "winload.efi" even though it's right where it should be and it has a valid hash.
Guys quit with the hug of death, I'm trying to buy one!
🤤
As long as this is Linux friendly, I am sold
Surprised you didn't mention Fairphone at all! They've led the way in the smartphone space, and my FP3 is fantastic. I'm really hopeful this is the turning point for repairable tech, maybe we won't *need* to win right-to-repair laws if enough companies can make this business model work.
Skin deep
11:53 had me dead 😂
Thanks for making this review. It's an important one!
1:38 almost got him
Now, if they would just do a "gaming" model that offered the ability to slot in a graphics card, and upgrade it, I would be sold. This is really cool, but I don't have much need for a basic computer because I already have 3 of those including my work laptop.
If we can somehow get an anime themed framework on this device this will definitely be a bestseller.
The only thing that would make this better is if they were willing to sell the chips on the motherboard to repair shops at a reasonable cost.
wow think framework's website has crashed!  thanks to Linus's endorsement!
You broke their site lol
It's like the IKEA of Laptops. Brilliant.
Interesting, but the built quality is below my standard for the main device.
I think we crashed the site hahaha
I don't feel those arguments in the beginning ever hold any water no matter how difficult it is to repair, does not equate to not being repairable ;)
framework just made the best laptop ever  for my work  framework laptop is an no compromise laptop
No dedicated GPU, for now, moving on.  Clevo has had this basically since 2008? including swappable GPUs and CPUs depending on the motherboard. I am hopeful in this turning out to be a good product, but for now with no dedicated GPU and a sticker price of 1000usd? Um... Hard pass. I can get an Acer for 600 with a 1660 or higher in it... I get that the ability to swap things out is the /point/ but this is going to fit a very... specific niche until then.
Their Website is down because you drove so much traffic there LOL
Well I think you successfully crashed their website. Endless errors and going back and even the internal 500 errors. Guess you're not the only one that wants one.
I think you broke their website. LOL
So many people are going to the website you can't load the website lol
I LOVE this concept and team behind Framework. Need more modularity in life.
their website is down lol
watching another expensive product that i cannot buy with my i3 3240 , 6gb of ram and intel hd.
Linus took their site down.
Oh no! Sites been given the Linus Tech Tip of Death
LTT killed their website: 500 Internal Server Error
hate apple because it's not upgradable. I'm a person who RUNs WINDOWS ON IT and sells it for a profit. but there was also a phone that never came out that was 100% Upgradable
Any chance you could do a video on hooking up that external box to this Laptop?
We hugged the website to death lol.
Your voice change from frecuency like if you are still in puberty. Annoying.
Linus: How are these guys so together? Man: They got a strong framework  Absolutely amazing.....most probably it was scripted still, damn good
The power on AC feature might be useful when running the motherboard outside of the original laptop case.
holy shit this product is amazing. Its been a long time since I've seen something this exciting, congratz to everyone who participated in this project. Honestly, I wish I could buy it!
Site is down... Damn
TOO MUCH CAMERA SHAKING!!!!
me like
Tested, already did this content.
So the site has crashed… oops
Aaaaaand their website is returning error 500 😄
Wish they will introduce a convertible/2in1 as I rely on this function
This is one company I'd really love to see succeed. These guys actually know what the consumer wants and have the know-how to build it. If they actually implement good upgradability they will become serious competition for traditional laptop brands that will be forced to acknowledge their shortcomings.
I can't even order one the website is down Linus see what it did lol 😂
i'm more likely to forget to put one back in then lose one.
but, can it run minecraft?
This. Is. Amazing. Don't care what it is but I want ANOTHER video on this laptop! xD
this is something that i would invest in if i had the money.
third party repairs: we are dead now   me: oh just buy a new part
I would enjoy better speaker quality :-)
I would honestly buy this, just need to accidentally throw out my 5 year old laptop out the window now! :')    Hope the company or this kind of product stays alive, definetly gonna buy this when my old laptop dies.
They even let you decide to get it with windows or to install the OS yourself (with a 5$ key to reduce cost), I don't know many laptop that doesn't force you to pay full price for windows
Linus, you broke their website I wanted to buy one!!
Honestly seems like a good product. I would actually buy it.
GG Linus…. Broke their website ;)
Linus ! But what about graphics
They already sell magsafe adaptors
Give me an amd model and ill take your entire stock
im so sad i already spent an arm and a leg for a a top of the line dell xps 15, but definitely worth a consideration in a few years when I want to upgrade
Framework website doesn't do anything when I hit the chose configuration button
(13:18) I have a whole list of features I dream of seeing Framework add to future models if they're able to have things their way (repairable, upgradable, etc), and one of those is touch input! So far, I feel they did great for a first model!  Most of the features I dreamt of them adding: - Lenovo Yoga style tablet with touch and active pen - Eraser head mouse (like Lenovo ThinkPad) - Dual battery system (like Lenovo Power Bridge) - Keyboard with the Windows logo key instead labelled "Meta" for Linux-based desktop OSes (like Debian, Fedora, etc.) - (less likely) Options to customise parts (custom lettering/graphics on keyboard, bezel, lid) - Open-source system firmware (like System76) but as an alternative option
I am so freaking sold on this. amazing product
fuck my life. I'm buying one today.
Tbh this is more “modular” than it is “upgradable”. My ass was so hyped waiting to see if they could just swap the gpu and cpu. 😭
seems like good way to teach kid computer hardware that runs it.
U GUYS just crashed their website :D
Waiting for something ARM/RISC-V based, but then I'm all over this. I'm sold on just being able to easily replace the battery alone, everything else is icing on the cake.
Best. Laptop. *Ever!*
These are the types of companies we need to have around now adays. Not google, not microsoft not apple
Openly repairable and accessible laptop... that's what the world need right now...
Maybe I'm an edge case or something, but I don't need a super slim laptop.  If this thing was double the thickness, with more slots for me use, it could also have a bigger fan and battery.  But even as it is, if I needed a laptop, I would certainly consider this one with a bunch of extra parts that I may or may not need all the time.  I like the configurability.
Where is the funny girl he gave a job? Is she still around?
What about the MNT Reform Laptop? Nearly completely open source!
Built to last. This should be the future of tech
Phones will be next
Just checked the website and its having some issues. What have you done Linus?!?!?!?!?!
I don't think they could be more respectable. Everything they seem to be doing here is awesome.
The tested seagull hypothetically pull because rainstorm connolly wait versus a beneficial motorcycle. stingy, chief polo
Framework: *successfully created and market an effectively 2020s equivalent fully modular laptop* AMD: *Creates very decent gpus and cpus for less heat and noticeable amount of performance with the same node* RISC-V: *Exists and very noticeable better than Arm* Me: IT IS TIME, BRETHREN! THE RESSANICE OF THE LOW END BUT POWERFUL GAMING 2 IN 1 LAPTOPS. *Everyone start to do a jjba pose at the same time.
I don't even need a laptop at all but I might buy one anyways. This is amazing!
I LOVE IT... I LOVE IT >>> I LOVE IT LEARN BROTHERS AND SISTERS NO EXCUSE NOW.
its me or the web of framework is down
HP Eleitebook:  Im boutta end this mans whole career!  (Side note: this is from experience from my beautiful 2015 9480m, it had only three screws under the battery (easily removable) to remove to get the panels off!)
I would love to know how the speakers sound.  I use a MacBook because I depend a lot on the quality of the laptop speakers (very specific use-case, please don't judge).  I desperately want to get away from Apple.  Those speaker modules looked legit, so I'm hoping this can be my escape.
Holy smokes Linus bought one ON THE SPOT? Man I gotta recommend this to my family when they next get a laptop, I'm not a laptop fan myself tho I prefer a PC
Maybe even Dbrand can do stuff with it
The fact that the screw is colour coded is apple level attention to detail without any apple selfishness to it.
I think we hugged their site to death, it's throwing an error when I click "Configure Now"
The 'configure now' link isn't working right now... 😫
Someone needs to hire a team to hold a catch net under Linus 24/7
When my 2013 MacBook Pro finally dies I will be ordering one of these.
What’s next, upgradable desktops?
isn't that basically, what Lenovo does with their ThinkPad lineup? specifically the T models.
I don't think I've ever seriously considered buying a product from watching a LTT video before this. Too bad Framework's website is down...
LTT has just about crashed the Framework site :(. It's soooooooooo slow. I think that is a great gauge for how intriguing and desirable a product is.
Clicked the link. "Something went wrong". Clicked "Learn more". 500 Internal Server error. Yep, the Linus experience.
The website crashed...
Please let this succeed. I'd love to see a more powerful version targeted towards professionals that do video editing and after effects work in the future from them. I think that market would love something like this.
We crashed their site, I think.
If they make laptops with GPUs as well that can be swapped in  the future, consider me sold as well.
They are hiring?  One sec. I’ve got to make a phone call…
Went to check out the website it looks like the website is down possibly due to the traffic from this video
I really hope people will support this effort! This is exactly what I'm looking for. I hope the company will keep supporting this and expand with upgradable motherboards. This will save só much e-waste...  I just got a used laptop last year, so I'm good for a while, but on my next upgrade, I'll certainly be looking for this. Please keep us updated on this stuff.
I need to be able to swap out cpu and gpu then I'm sold.....
And their website has crashed from all the folks going to it.... 🤣
This WILL be my next laptop
It;s sad that the average person won't get the product.
I'm sold
there are so many people on their website it's not even functioning today :P plenty of interest I think.
Site is down. Guess you just gave them a "Hug of Death". I am so glad they exist as a company!
If they make a touch capable 2-in-1 model, I'd probably never go back to another laptop without a powerful GPU
This is tempting, but I'm a bit annoyed that a USB type-A takes up a full modular slot, but that's not a deal breaker.
I like that they offer a bring your own RAM, storage, and wireless option. I do wish they had a gaming version with numpad and dedicated graphics.
Love it. I hope they make something with a GPU next, this would make for an excellent work laptop.
Damn, this company is it. They really make everything happen very solid without any real bad choices because of the upgradeability and modularity! Amazing. Linus buying it was the peak of this video and show you are doing very good.
What about CPU replacement? Did Linus mention that?
You didn't mention the biggest disadvantage: They only have 4 IO ports. And last time I checked their modules only had a single port in them. So if you use one for the charger, one for hdmi, and one for the mouse USB port,  then you only have one extra port to connect a pendrive, or a network card or anything else.
The joke is that this devicce looks quite polished and elegant. The finish isn't terrible. Sure it can't compete with the built quality from other notebooks / ultrabooks but it is acceptable while being so modular. The joke now is that this is a first model. The first of it's kind from nowdays. First products are basically always terribly bad compared to what they can and will become later if support continues. So just imagine what other laptop makers could do if they want to. There is literally no reason why they couldn't make a Razerblade or Maccbook quality laptop with a fully modular design. If a small startup can do almost as good, others for sure can do way better.
I would love to see this laptops display supporting 100% dci P3 color range and having a a crue to live color calibration. (means not to warm, not to cold, not over saturated, no tint or something, just how the colors are in neutral light conditions, as if there wouldn't be a display.)
Just switch to it already
Some 15-20 years ago I replaced a monitor on my roommate's Dell Laptop... this laptop seems like a return to those times! Not that I will replace my Surface Pro any time soon, but this laptop looks like something I'd totally get!
Linus keeps raving about that swappable I/O, but in reality it's just recessed USB-C ports. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE USB-C and I like the concept of recessing them so the dongles you plug in don't take up more space, but lets not kid ourselves. At the end of the day, all of the ports that he plugged in are dongles. It's 4 USB-C ports, that is the same I/O as the MacBook.
Turning the old mobo into a NUC is super cool. I wonder how they handle I/O.
So, its seems like a open source hardware thing :)
So much ahead of any competition in right-to-repair that this'll make most upcoming releases look outdated out of the box. Throws to face that doing serviceable laptop ain't hard nor a major hinderance. Seriously considering if I could live with Windows again.
17:52 i thought he said he was sponsored by microsoft and i was like bro waht
What I like most about this product is that it exposes all the anti-repair decisions by garbage companies like Apple, Dell or Microsoft.
I wonder how long its going to take for Frame Works website to come back up LOL
I just want to request video about framework laptop after i see pcmag video
I would feel so proud to own this laptop!
I would ACTUALLY buy this
this kind of videos are the reason i didn't unsubscribe yet
I would imagine the aim of this company is to be bought out by a big firm, like an Asus or HP, etc...so they can incorporate these designs.
I miss CPU upgrades in laptops. They should make a comeback. So much e-waste....  Good job on Framework, I wish them total success, they're doing it right!
This reminds me of the good old Thinkpad times, when you could install HDDs or even serial interfaces in the ODD bay
Joe
I am 99% sure the traffic from this video has just taken their servers offline.
4:20 that is NOT THE REASON other manufacturers do it and you KNOW that!!
Please be profitable
went to order one and the website crashed lmao. The untapped market here is so huge their servers couldnt handle it
Fucking Incredible
I am gonna wait and see how many people want to buy this ThIn UlTrAbOoK over other ultra books. I don’t see a point of encouraging peeps to open it up
Linus should have asked Anthony, because the Pinephone got all the upgradability and its a smartphone.
Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd the their website is dead
you crashed their site
The thing is, If you design a laptop to be serviceable and use standardised parts then you as a laptop engineer will have less work for the next generation when you can reuse half of the old laptop parts
Wow - this is a really cool thing. I wish someone would do this with  car company. I want a car with DIY service in mind, color coded things, the same standard bolts/screws throughout for minimal tools, easy access to most repair, lots of mount points for 3d party extras, modular designs.
I will buy it only when there is an AMD Ryzen cpu.
I personaly don't need a laptop, but wish them luck
Did he say "dell llll" lol
This is super cool!
I feel like we rarely see Linus this happy, a pure treat!
Next Windows Laptop I get will be this
I think their website can't keep up with the onrush right now (2h after upload)
My lenovo thinkpad t430 is upgradable, I even swapped out the i3 dual core for a quad core i7 with no issues. Also 2 internal pcie slots helps. Only thing I don't like is the white list, but this can be changed too by a custom bios.  So who says the big players don't do customization and user upgradeability. BTW sonys laptops used to have numbers next to the screws to show what size they were.
Just add the means to connect an external graphics card with two-ways and voila, it's a semi-gaming laptop.
Hope this becomes a trend so we can have more beefy laptops that you can change the components of.
so, the framework page is down… thank you linus… :-)
"if building your own custom computer is so good why don't you build your own custom laptop" Framework: "ok"
I heard "...segue to our sponsor, cheesesteak" and I refuse to hear anything else.
LinusDropTips
yesssssssssssssss upgradeable laptop!!
And I think y'all crashed the website
I've been considering a new laptop and now I know that when my laptop gets worse I don't have to spend a week contemplating different devices!
11:50 killed me LOL
I need to buy this, I want to support people who honor right to repair. Come on guys, let's keep these guys in business!
Videos reviewing products like this are why I love ltt
What about changing the display?
if this gets going with more upgrades this could blow apple and maybe microsoft or other companies out of the water by sheer satisfaction alone.
This is POGers
Haha websites under maintenance. Are the USB C ports thunderbolt or USB 3.1?
Woawww, it looks so amazing !
This video crashed their site due to demand... Lol
one word: gpu?
I wanna get a laptop for collage and this is the most perfect thing I have seen as a IT student it be amazing to have
"how are you going to stay profitable?"  Do you know how easy it is to stay profitable? Apple and co have been running an absolute GRIFT for decades now.
This is one of few tech-products I want to buy not only to use it but also to support the manufacturer and the development of future products of this kind.
That's nice because is not going to make so much trash 😇😇😇
Dell had some modular machines in the 90s and early 00s, I's not new just resurrected
The only thing that sucks about this laptop right now is that I already bought a new one like 6 months ago :(. I would absolutely love to have a laptop like this (maybe they can make this in a 2 in 1 format a la Microsoft Surface?). I really hope a lot of people buy this so they continue to make these laptop and improve on it because when I'm in the market for a new laptop I really want to buy this.
If i had the money i would buy one of these
This is honestly really cool
Dell Adamo 13, no screws, just a one switch. BOOOM!!!!
Linus talking about ripping solder pads from antennae and I'm getting flashbacks to all the times noobie me did that
just goes to show you apple's R&D budget isnt about actually making good products. its all about devising new and creative ways to force users to pay out the ass to repair or replace their products.  Now about upgradability. This things would blow the competition out of the water if they decided on a motherboard standard that is always the same. that way when this things become obsolete, one just needs to purchase a new motherboard and cpu kit, pop out the old one, and install the new one. and with as much of a no-brainer as it looks like theyve made things, even your average user could make the swap. it just needs to be supported properly by the company that makes these. and with how these things usually go in the long run, the competition will find some way to stamp them out of existence before they can threaten the status quo for the rest of them and thereby force them to innovate and become more competitive.
Whoever said they got a strong framework, please Linus give him a raise and put him in more videos
I hope the company doesn't fail, because if it does, it doesn't matter how upgradeable the machine is, because you won't ever be able to get upgrades for it. Hope they survive!
And the site is down framework is definitely gonna be excited about this level of attention lol.
No benchmarks?
linus is bricked up this whole video
A shame they don't yet ship to Australia...
Oh look laptop where you can install bigger storage, big woop
Sorry I just don’t see it as looking elegant at all. It looks as elegant as can be EXPECTED from a product like this. But I don’t think it’s elegant.
where are the tech tips? this is more or less press release regurgitation :-/
if only they had ryzen
damn its first vido that made me buy something, im selling kidney by the way call if interested
The magnetic charging port in my MacBook Pro destroyed my Mac because I couldn’t charge it anymore
This is currently not available for my country so I'm going to keep an eye on it cause it sounds pretty great overall.
Unless Framework can ship them by the millions, sadly the general approach of locking the hardware from the end user and planned obsolescence championed by the likes of Apple will still be the order of the day.
Linus is hyped up for this one.
Throw an old ThinkPad layout keyboard on there and I'll buy 3
I was looking forward for ordering one, but not available in Finland yet 🥲
The best endorsement from Linus I could possibly imagine for any product is him buying one in the middle of the shoot. ... And framework got it. Congrats, they're lightning in a bottle.
11:55 what the hell was the editing team doing lmao
does the internal PCIE slots like the wifi one, doesn't it have a whitelist? for compatible devices? can I go and connect anything there?
Its a fuckin gimmiick.
Now we just need a Gamer edition with dedicated graphics!
It almost look like any other Lenovo laptop, what I'd mean by that is, generally speaking a lot of the things in your typical Lenovo pc (desktop and laptop) can be swapped out.
LTT hug of death coming in 3.. 2.. 1..
Wow so cool, can't wait to not hear anything about it in the next few years
Maybe if someone developed a dock to interface to become a full desktop is gonna be very futuristic. Modular and upgradable.  Also this is probably gonna be very good with linux guys.
This is a  welcome step in the right direction.  However:  USB-ish type plug and play peripherals  is the upgrade path we have wanted for years, albeit without the slowdowns that afflict hardware that comes with using USB connections.  Why shouldn't we able to plug in CPU, storage, memory etc, w/o having an engineering degree and an over developed sense of competency.    I mean... your grandmother can plug something into a USB port.  Why should she ever have to unscrew the back of the computer case?  Upgrading a computer by now (40 years after getting my Apple IIe)  should be as easy as changing the batteries in a flashlight.
It’s a super cool design, but has an extremely limited market segment.  What’s the chance of your mom/dad/non tech friends spending extra to buy this?  It’s important to look through the lens of the “average” user.
These are preorders? When do they ship?
Sold, ordering one right now. Thanks, Linus.
The thing that gets me the most is the function of battery disconnect. Like why do not more laptops have that integrated?????? Like most gaming laptops will be plugged in the wall MOST of the time anyway, just let us have the option to do that so we don’t need to damage our battery! This laptop is the next big thing, I hope they sincerely can stay around for consumers that actually understands their vision for this.
It appears the frame work site is down. Probably from everyone looking at the site. I mean their first laptop seems so user friendly, and I just happen to be in the market for a new laptop.
This is pretty neat. :)
This webcam is actually amazing
The website is still crashing because everyone wants one lol
Man that thing is amazing. Only thing i'd want is more port per module if possible. Like two Type C instead of one. I'd be amazing to see a module where we could hide a mouse or headphone dongle inside. Also, with AMDs new APU (steam deck), this thing would be fire. A crazy thing not mentioned, you could drop in a amp/dac in the module, a LTE card or even a capture card. Potential boys, potential!
Guys, you broke their website! :D  I am unable order one now.. sigh!
new companies like this with better products and better customer support will easily outpreform Apple and other  companies by pure satsifaction alone... a true capitalist market  offers products consumers want instead of products the company wants..
If they're bringing back something like the MMX standard for GPUs, I'm sold!!!!! A 17 inch version of this probably could fit something like a modular GPU...
I see that #RightToRepair is gaining momentum, yay
I just realized doing fun modding type stuff on these would be amazing
But here's the true question: Can it run Crysis?
I wish they sell in Czechia :S
what an incredible little laptop, this is the way the laptop industry needs to go. complete user upgradability.
This is actually awesome. I’m mad that I just bought a laptop because now I have to wait 3+ years until I can buy this
If they did deliver in my region I was seriously tempted on ordering one, hope they grow enough that I can after some time.
Maybe you could swap the motherboard in the future as well - keeping the rest of the laptop :)
tried to order one, the website crashed and I'm pretty sure MacBook fan boys dis-liked this video.
LOL, Linus broke their website...  Suop!
that's so cool we need more companies like that
Team Red needs to be part of this
Thanks for the vid, Linus. the Framework laptop looks really cool, it almost makes me wish I were looking for a small Intel laptop.  I'll reevaluate in a few years when framework has a performant ARM or RISC option with a bigger screen or if my criteria change. For now, still sticking with my plans to procure a 16" M1X MacBook Pro this year. Kudos to the FrameWork folks for following through and producing what looks like an awesome product! I hope they prosper and keep up the great work.
I want to see one of these with an AMD Ryzen
No gpu?
That 3:2 monitor looks very 16:9-ish.
this + linux = win
Alex going "Cry me a river" sounded so genuine, ofcourse, understandable
I think my 84 year tech-phobic mother could put this together.
The framework site is down, so it's safe to say this is what everyone wanted.
Website is dying rn
People are also gonna come back when framework releases a touch screen for their laptops too.
now this is saucey nocap, sign me up
can you play games
I can choose between single and dual channel? Im close to tears 😭
Now only question when will this product be available in india.
Damn linus, you crashed their website lmao
This is awesome
I think you have crashed their website - great video great product
I would love to see upgradable GPUs too, maybe in a "slide in" expansion card
I really want to buy one now this is a perfect laptop for anyone good job framework
this laptop is the diffrerence between people who think "i don't know how to do that so lets not do it" and people who think "i don't know how to do that so lets figure out how to do it"
When these become available in sweden I will buy one. I'll start selling them aswell.
I love when Linus is genuinely excited by the product he's showcasing :)
I do kinda need a new laptop... Hm... I do also like my pressure sensitive pen though. Hm...
You can even order it without an OS so you wont get scammed for a windows license youll never use.. This is the perfect Laptop
Definitely hope for the success for this company even though I have no intention of buying this laptop. My current one is too new to justify.  If only they could sort of partner up with like asus and other brands. To make modular laptops. Then fully swappable cases, ie laptops.
This is the kind of innovation the tech-industry really needs to become more sustainable!
BATTERY DISCONNECT! Here's a 'WOW' for you.
PORTS!!!!! At last, a company that understands that I might want more than three USB ports. I will be buying one of these units ASAP!
ahh yes, 64GB RAM IN A FUKING LAPTOP
this is a good, i may reccomend this to my sister since she's looking for a new laptop
But can it CAD giant Solidworks models?
This is the definition of right to repair.
This is the type of device is something we would use at NASA. And if it's a good idea for NASA it's going to be perfectly suited for the rest of the world.
The dream would be for them to make a deal with Intel/AMD to put in socketable CPUs like the og thinkpads
It looks like this vidio DDOSed their site :)
Either it's coincidental timing, or people liked this so much that the website went down 😂
The need to make a touchscreen that goes where the keyboard does and it would be a tablet as well.
i now want to work at framework when i grow up
Seems like they are currently facing a massive denial of service attack (aka. LTT community) on their website :D
The only thing I'm sad about is that Framework isn't publicly traded.
imagine an upgradeable laptop running linux.  you could probably use the same laptop for 10+ years [using an 11 year old dell ispiron with lubuntu atm]
Their website is overloaded. Everyone likes this.
Why not just build the power LED on the same power line as the camera? Why bother with a built in shutter.
Nah I’ll take my MacBook every day of the week; we don’t buy them for upgradability
If these guys do an IPO, I'll be there
That looks like a KiwiCo Crate. :-D
Nice proof of concept. Too bad it won't be available for sale.
We haven’t opened ordering in your region yet ARGH !!!!!!!!1 DONT FORGET EU GUYYYYS
Its cool and all. But there is a reason why big companys arent doing this. Very small minority will care about this.
i'm sold    2021 version of my x230 with gimmicky io  :D
completely upgradable, amm just cpu is soldered.
What a dream it would be to work on or repair that laptop, I see no compromises on anything here. Just shows that every other SI/manufacturer is greedy, lazy or both.
I love everything about this product and approach. I'm going to buy two. The wife and I both have an Asus UX301la and this is what will replace them.
Lol the site is crashing🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol.... I think LTT crashed Frameworks website! -.- (also we should've had a "only available to ship to US" maybe?
I didn't know I needed this but now I really want one
I'm definitely designing mine with that cad thingy
wanted to check it out to show my friend whos into this kinda stuff. we basically crashed the site lol
Sorry can Someone tell me a good double monitor arm or 2 single monitor arm?
That's some straight up awesome tech!
GPU??? Is it upgradeable??? 👀
Love it - holding out for an AMD model with at least an APU, though.
Good job guys, we broke the website!
Linus: Drivers! Linux users: What is this? some joke im to free to understand?
Linus I lost all my contacts man, call me asap
We gave their site a nice hug of death
I wanna know the price of the company to buy it-----Apple
"What I also bought is the segue to our sponsor." No, Linus, the sponsor buys the segue.
11:52 this is a face of pure and utter happiness
Both thick and flimsy???
Can we get a performance test?
LIENUS at work again "he bought the segway to the sponsor" how many other lies have I been told by LIENUS Media Group.
I’m honestly pretty impressed. I don’t use laptops personally, but I know plenty that do
I hope that this company won’t go out of business and be successful enough for starting a new permanent tier for laptops 😬
This is unreal😍 support this company
If it's that customisable and up-gradable it's a match made in heaven with Linux
"the dells not even @#$%ing thinner!?" - lol
This probably will not passed to my country, because company that monopolized market will just bribe the council to not allowed this thing exist...
site is down! daaaam Linus, you broke it
Seriously? Linus is sooo amazed. Haha! So are we.
FANTASTIC laptop product - loving the user upgradability at last! Would love to see a top end gamer version where you could swap the GPU. One small correction to what Linus said in the video 8min 33sec "like any other laptop, the CPU is soldered directly to the board" ": The XMG ULTRA 17 (2021) LAPTOP takes a desktop CPU which can be upgraded, not soldered in, and it also has a discrete. removable, graphics card.
The next time I'm on the market for a new laptop, I'll 100% consier one of these. I fully support the idea
This reminds me of a concept ad for a phone called the block phone where the components attach magnetically to the back
Bro Linus,‌ My eyes and attention are on your head cap!  Which brand is this & Where did you buy your cap?
Yes!!
Also, you can choose no OS, so you dont pay for the OEM windows you might not even use.
Within 2 hours there website got overrun with people it's so beautiful.
This looks incredible I want everyone who is looking for a thin and light laptop to see this and get one
I haven't seen Linus so genuinely excited for a video in a long time
WILL IT RUN CRYSIS?
Aaaaand we did it, the website is down 😂
A modern version of the ExpressCard would match much of this laptop's modular expandability.
You broke Framework's website.
Not a laptop person but that was awesome!
this is my dream laptop from all my 15 years of laptop complaints about why they cant just make a laptop that can be that easy to fix
7:28 I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE!
Headphone Jack 🥳
Soon as they start putting on GPU's im sold.
I hope they get the support they need and success comes in their way. so in the future, they can make more different types of laptops for all markets as well. like a mid-range, less powerful default hardware, a bit bulkier, mass-produce type one.
thanks for the timestamps!
As Linus said the philosophy that made this laptop is so much more trusting, positive and progressive than what we may be used to from other system integrators. I really hope Framework are able to make it worth their while.
It just so heartwarming to see people still care for consumers and make product that is repairable and upgradable. I just lost all hope for something like that to be happening.
Now if Linus was REALLY committed to upgradeability & reuseability he'd transition his entire business over to Framework.  New video series maybe...?
These guys should partner with System76 for an ultimate open-source computer
Simply amazing and perfect :-)
13:10 Still, screens are pretty much universal too. So there's still a big posibility that it's also upgradeable right now.
This is amazing!
Gonna have to email them to find out about investment opportunities.... I just sold one of my cars and I now have $85k and nothing to spend it on
I'm so happy I want to give them a hug
Now this, this is gonna be my next laptop. Sadly its not available in my area so far ;w;
Couldn't have posted this video at a better time, since I'm looking for a new laptop.
I was just looking at that case yesterday and was looking for where it was sold. Thank you LTT !
Still waiting on Aorus monitor reviews
The real question is... Gaming laptops when?.. :D
I would totally get one if they had a version with an Nvidia GPU
But how do I put a 4K 60FPS camera in there?
that battery looks like a regular battery like what is in a phone. back in like 2010 and befor the battery was slotted in on the outside. with a plastic housing and everything
Finally a perfect laptop to go with for ages and do not care about these giant manufacturer's stupidity and secrecy of components and unupgradability.
Forget magnetic charging cable. Communities with appear with this laptop. You can make a complete dock that would just plug into 1, or maybe even 2 of the modular ports. And then imagine what you can do with a dock.   Way more i/o, maybe almost like a desktop PC, external GPU maybe? Proprietary or legacy connectors that some people need for work?  I mean yeah you can already do some of this now, but it won't ever be as integrated as this laptop could make be it. Like old thinkpad laptop's docks desktop replacement with very minimal compromise
I guess old things are now retro. I hope PC card enjoys its new life.
this is never going to take off its a fantastic idea but yeahhhhh
I feel like I would be more likely to throw my money at them if they offered a dedicated graphics version. ( I have multiple very good laptops, without graphics, already so buying another needs to have it)
It's not my thing but if i had the money i would buy it just to support the company and then give it away or something
I think you animals crashed their site.
So no thunderbolt?
my next laptop
Can i have a cheap monitor? I noticed ur other videos and i was wondering if yall just kept them if u do may i have it ?
Sooooo I guess we broke their website now? :p
this laptop and company is just a big fat middle finger to greedy companies like apple xD add in the new registration that is trying to ban these greedy companies from preventing self/thrid part repair, im so looking forward to apple being taken down a few pegs
Website is crashed already if I'm not mistaken :P
Hopefully framework becomes successful enough to get offers from nvidia and amd. Would really love to see modular gpus
All it needs is an upgradeable GPU and an option for a non-white chassis (grey would be nice) and I'm buying one! It's such a great design, so I'm hoping they do well.
14:24 us Linux users have this for everything ;)
havnt seen linus this excited in a long time
You post this and the companies website goes down :)
I hope CPUs can become modular again in time. I remember swapping out CPUs on my C2D laptop.
My laptop works fine, but this is what I really want!
14:36. Let me introduce you to Windows deployment services
Framework might just be my next laptop. As long as it has no issues with Linux (for example, my laptop, the Lenovo S540 15 long name, has a fingerprint device that doesn't work in Linux no matter what I do (fingerprintd, fingerprint-gui, etc.)  We will be watching your career with great interest
16:19 baah baa but I was told to use my laptop plugged in. 🔌!!!!
I hope this is the future.. please be the future..
Finally, a good use for QR codes on the user end.
i am only 4 min in and i am sold
I will definitely purchase it if launched in India
This and the Steam Deck are the first tech products in a while that I'm actually excited about.
This! This is what I’m talking about, the future isn’t just services the future is more about values and power, its about truly personalizing your device rather then making it disappear, its about providing good experience and beyond lets hope this company lives up to the potential  Also I’m someone many define an “apple fanboy” I love their products but even I not only recognize the importance of this device but also the future it represents  Every company from Apple to dell can take notes here from selling colored bezels to literally snapping components there is more for this even in terms of security then against
I want one.
They didn't mention the framework marketplace. They want to build a ebay like marketplace to be able to buy and sell your old modules
Hört man nie wieder von...
11:53 This moment makes the video.
wow that IS cool! if i need a new laptop i will have  have to a look on that. no glue no snap/click cover that breaks when you try to open it.
Throws money at screen
Dream laptop
Like i can see there are 190 dislikes on this .... Which clearly means there are 190 OTHER laptop Manufacturers out there 🤣🤣🤣
What ever did happen to that Dell/Alienware gaming laptop that was upgradable? Did they not follow through with ANY upgrades!?!
Fellas.... You killed the Website.
but, can it GAME?
11:53 What happened there ??
Plz add an ethernet plug!!!!! If they make a keyboard with the little IBM trackpoint on it like my ThinkPad ........ I'M SOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Another question, if the battery is removable, why not make it hot-swappable? That would have been awesome!
That _packaging_ though! It continues the philosophy of the laptop, which shows that the manufacturers are serious about this. Minimal single-use plastic, in favor of recyclable cardboard. Steve from GamersNexus will greatly approve.
Not having a dedicated gpu is the only thing keeping me from getting this instead of a dell xps 15
What is the point of all this if separate parts are only selling by the same company? Another wanabe soyboy nerd yada-yada...
The ethical nature of this project is marred by the fact that it uses intel processors which are created in apartheid israel.
like some kind of m o n k e
I wish I knew this was coming before I bought a chromebook.
You got me excited for that laptop. I actually preordered it.
Can these guys partner with the Linux system integrators like System 76 and the like? Please?
you got the black and white cables backwards on the wifi card
I am in a coughing fit at the string frame work comment,   Wish one of these was around when I bought my laptop 3 years ago
8:34 The i7 3632qm at least is a detachable laptop cpu, as I have one lying around atm
Not enough upgradability options. I can't swap out the speakers and replace them with more I/O. Displays not bad but there's no dedicated GPU options (a swappable GPU option would be cool). Even though everything can be swapped around, I'm still stuck to Framework and what they provide. One thing I would want to do is swap the battery for a lower one, and put a 2.5 HDD in instead. Case design is also smaller towards the front (trackpad area), limiting the amount of room for possible upgrade components. No modules in the back (which typically is fine but with a single fan it looks like there's a lot of unused room) or front, and all the modules are just USB passthrough, so you're limited to the speed and capabilities of USB (until the mobo gets upgraded)
Disappointed with the misleading clickbait title...
being able to customize your I/O is never something I thought I would see in a laptop. I hope they stay until I buy my next upgrade.
iFixit repairability score: *>9000 / 10*
I'm just waiting until they make an inplugable GPU... would be amazing
This seems to be a really, really cool laptop. Hope they can make more of these
I really want one of these, I just wish that link worked...
As long as they can keep making modules, they could start taking over the market since no other laptop can really be upgraded.
This is awesome, now make one for gamers. I like what this company is doing, just a missed opportunity with the battery though, could've made it modular but unlike the modules that use usb c male, make the battery swappable with usb c female and be able to be charged with any usb c charger. and screw it if the battery replacement is that easy make it have 100w fast charging, recharge the laptop in 15 minutes. who cares about longevity if you don't even need a screw driver to swap it. like the new macbook lasts 15 hours, I dont even need to plug my laptop in. if it lasts 10 hours on a charge,  with 2 batteries it'll last 20 hours. if you got 2 chargers, boom, 20 hours use in 15 minutes of charging. and since the battery is usb c make it work as a powerbank for your phone too.
I hope this company is successful. But I  fear that if they're too successful, Apple might use their power with suppliers or the legal system to ruin them.
Is their site down?
Found my new dream laptop
Dude I think your review crashed Framework's site! LOL
This is awesome! I'm thrilled to see that a new/small company is setting the new standard for right to repair, as well as upgradability and post-purchase customization.   I'm not in the market for a new laptop at the moment, but I can't wait to see what these guys are offering in a year or two when I am! Touchscreen and GPU options would make this perfect!
Using QR codes is also genius as if the documentation regarding a component or process changes, all they need to do is publish an update to where the QR code points. Also saves money with printing paper manuals.
it would be cool if they just make a  mini video card that can be plugged and unplugged  kinda like  you are going to a business meeting and y need just to use hdmi port or something like that  after that you are going at home and you change your port it into gtx 1060 6gb and plays some games for relax  i hope they can make something like that  and i will consider to buy a laptop for everyday use XD
Kinda wish the headphone jack was replaceable because that's what will break first
im so happy to see a product like this! hopefully it has a direct impact on the laptop market!
Might be good for enterprise.  Will check these out.
I might buy one...
This product looks 🔥🔥🔥
you crashed their site Linus :D
i might have just seen a laptop i would acutely buy
If I needed a laptop I would definitely get this 😮
My god this is truly beautiful
We killed there website lol
I think we crashed the Framework site:) Will not load.
Framework website is getting hammered right now.
amazing
Don't mind the dislikes they're from dell and apple.
So if you do not plug in a module, do you get an extra USB C port?
Dbrand team up, bringing meme skins
NGL that's pretty cool
the upgradable part isnt important because most wont shell out for a new mobo and cpu especially in such a thermally constrained chassis but being able to change the ram and ssd is important. but i do like that its modular not because of upgradability but ease of repair if someone were to water damage it and could dismantle and repair it more easily. ive had to dismantle even 6 year old hp's which were held in with nothing but clips and no matter how gentle i was some still broke and i had to replace the entire plate. i like the screws and no stupid clips approach.
I wanted an APU with Vega "one milion" and i get Vega 8. This is outrages someone please make a laptop APU with a bilion CU's.
I hope they add options for higher refresh rate screens in the future.
I really hope this modular approach becomes more broadly embraced. It actually makes laptops more approachable because you can fix or upgrade in the future.
Is it possible for graphics cards to be an add-on using this interface (USB 3.2)?
The difference between what's best for the customer and what's best for the share holders.  Run by engineers and not accountants?  Hit me.  PS I think Linus has killed their website :)
Cool, site's down. I see many people are interested. I actually got fed up with Intel discontinuing CPUs, nowadays you have to buy a whole used laptop to replace completely inexpensive junk. If they actually keep up with what they're hipping, it would make no financial sense to buy anything else. Let's hope they don't get too greedy with the collaborations, because I already see a McLaren keyboard going for $499 and some random pop artist backslid for $299...
Framework Website is down 👍😂😂
i think you guys broke their servers
I instantly want one. edit: nvm, only intel.
I’m not in the market for one an ultrabook.  If I was I’d buy this one, without doubt.
Awesome, I've always just had a desktop, but now I want one of these
Louis Rossmann approves.
please don't be this a flop, hope they'll succeed
look like we colapsed their webpage... it's freaking slow right now...
Whoa ! Hell has frozen O_O
i like this
Linus, I think traffic from this video has broken their site
Linus being amazed about QR CODE  Me in China:The NORM
Extra screws, wow that's true good intentions
This is one of the most excited Linus I've ever seen
As soon as I need a laptop these guys are getting all my money
lmao framework after this went live HOLY SHIT
Looks cool but why do they seemingly have the slowest website I've ever come across?
Linus, I think your publicity broke their website.
Apple should be crrrrying, half their bag is profit of overpriced accessories. and this would be an accessory goooold mine. Love to see their locked down philosophy get totally bodied.
if i had the money for a laptop this would be my immediate choice. Hope they succeed!
I'll give it a year. If Framework is still supporting this then I'd give it a shot.
seems like u crashed their page.
I great concept with great implementation. I hope this company goes far and sticks it to apple primarily.
Ok I want
their website crashed LOL
:0
Brilliant! I wonder if it has support to be a dummy terminal for another computer or mobile device over USB-c. That would be a cool way to extend its usefulness long past the practical life of its CPU.
Looks like we have DDOS'ed their server. :P
Linus during the review: "I'm sold, gonna order one right now" Stock: *SOLD OUT* Website: *CRASHED*
Let's start savinging some money for this it's better than Apple last Gen product in modular
Dont give a shit about laptops, i just wanna go back to when mobilephones had a removable battery.
Did the frame.work website crash ?
😂"they have a strong framework"
Linus i think you did IT, the framework website is crashed. 🤣
Congratulations, you crashed their website. :)
Lol they didn’t expect so many people to visit their site and it just crashed after 30min Linus uploaded the vid
Your wild hand gestures aren't required for your target audience. Save the theatrics and stop abusing the tech. Also... give me free stuff.
Well, I was waiting for them to talk about GPU, but they never did... I still like this, but it hope there'll be a larger model with upgradeable GPUs. I know this is possible, but very few manufacturers allow this, even in thicc gaming laptops (which is the reason why gaming laptops are such bad value).
Did anyone see the cracked back glass on Linus's phone???
ShutUpAndTakeMyMoney.jpg
Well there the servers went  bye bye never to be seen again
"activate windows"
I literally just busted out laughing when he said the dell's not even thinner. I want one.
I hope the bios gives more customization options like changing the boot logo without hackbgrt
just in one word astonishing
Their website crashed.
Ethernet IO module please? :) With 2.5 GBaseT.  That would be so awesome.  What would be awesome too? If they will release a small prebuild desktop case for that motherboard, if the next mainboard generations comes out.
Love to get a gaming laptop version of that.
i think your video crashed their preorder site.
LOVE this device, gonna buy one for sure ❤️❤️
I love that this company and the people behind it see the terrifying direction the industry is going in, and instead of just resigning to the reality of the way things are right now, are actively being the change that they want to see for the future.   It's beautiful to see.
40 minutes after this video got released and LTT fans DDOS'd the site in their enthusiasm.  Order now, this waitlist is gunna be killer ahahaha
How does it perform though?
There are laptops with cpu sockets - take a look at the thinkpad t440p for example - I'd love an AMD cpu in a socket in such a laptop
Me too
Yoink got one
It's not even like INDUSTRY STANDARD modular, insert-able peripheral cards are a new things for laptops.  Anyone remember PCMCIA PC cards?
Q: Do people want this? A: Their site is down from all the LTT viewer traffic . . .
i want the sd card and headphone jack to be on the front of the device rather than the side. please make the sd card full sized thanks
This is perfect for business and schools, so repairable.
I honestly floored this is like my ideal laptop because it just allows me to tinker with it and just have the feeling that it truly belongs to me and is not just a loan.
This is the best thing ever. Even if it is not available in my region yet, I really hope these guys succeed.
Imagine this plus mobile Ryzen APUs with (hopefully) RDNA/RDNA 2 igpu in the future.
BGA CPU and no MXM GPU, no thanks
Aaaaaaand just like that, frame.work is down. Congrats, people, we killed another site!
gime
Love it!
I think we may have brought down their site. It’s in maintenance mode right now when trying to look at pricing.
And down goes frameworks site lol
Lol I think their site's down rn because so many people clicked on it.
that webcam is great... better than most of those "high end"
Someone is ahead of the curve on right to repair.
Website not portable...lolz
Good job - you took their website down.
I love this !!
Consumer friendly product, as it should be. I want one !
Nice job Linus you broke their website...
I have seen a socketed laptop cpu (Athlon)
Imagine dell making a laptop with modules and upselling warranty for each module :D
Did Linus just bash the same kind of laptop he was sponsored by a year or so back? (The toughbook at 00:13)
I think the site experienced the hug of death...
This is amazing. It needs more coverage. If it is available in my country, this will definitely be my next laptop.
its smart but its going to fail, like anything that makes sense in this world
Their servers must be on fire rn.
I absolutely love this idea.  Hope other people do as well and it takes hold.
I been following this laptop for a while and I'm glad you cover it. I can't wait to get my hand on one
hey linus this is my firt comment on any video ever i like your positive energie would really love to meet you in person ive watched a bunch of your videos and just wish to learn more from you since i am extremely intrested in pc builds aswell as gaming tho my poor intel core i5 3330 has no motherboard any more since its ram first stopped working and then it eventualy went down completely and i cant find one compatible for my i5 cpu and watching you working on "real gaming pcs" i get goosbumps
I'm sad that I just got a new laptop. But you never know. Accidents happen 😉
THIS IS WHAT WE WANT AND NEED!!! #Righttorepair
Linus being over the moon for a repairable and customizable laptop.   It's sad that this a thing to be actually excited about. Points out how awful the current companies are conducting their business, and it should have never gotten this far....
Already crashed their site... :)
This would be a very good teaching tool for kids who want to get into computer making
Toshiba had modular laptops in the 90s - you could remove the cdrom and replace it with an extra battery :) However, I am happy that someone continue building computers like this.
Shut up and take my money.
I want this laptop. Please?
I want this laptop and this is one ME that would love to work for them
I hope they find some way to incorporate upgradable GPUs into their laptops.
thats awesome I really hope they manage to take off as a company
If I needed a new laptop, I'd be putting down a deposit today.
I think this video crashed their sight, I tried to go there and after taking forever to load it gave me the message "framework is undergoing maintenance right now. Please come back in a few minutes"
what a fantastic product
Linus became anti-drop guy overtime, that's neat
I think their website got hugged to death. Tons of people must be super hyped for this!
Oh yeah. This is cool. I unfortunately JUST bought a new asus. Oh well I’m sure I’ll love the asus too
You say you need at least 1 usb-c module to charge the thing but couldn't you technically just... Plug the charger into the port the module would connect into? Technically if you have enough clearance and are only using usb-c you might not need modules at all!
Y'all LTT fans are intense. I tried accessing Framework's website but it's crashing. It's awesome. And it only shows how LTT can influence market interest.
Great Linus, you killed their website with your enthusiasm.
I love what the company has done, but I hope they don’t get acquired only to be dismissed after that. Similar to what happened to Phoneblocks /Project ARA
You’ve DDOSed their website
OMG I can't wait to have availability in my country. That would solve soooo many problems.  I honestly believe they will offer motherboard replacements in the future that you can install by just changing the motherboard. Imagine in the future when ARM becomes a thing there will be more space to work with so you can keep the same freaking laptop and just change the motherboard, add more battery and shit. Awesome product.
You are probably responsible for their website being down atm. I want one.
Pretty sure you crashed their site…
They need to make an android phone with replaceplate batteries just like in early 2010's
Oh God I want one! I really hope this company takes off.
This is the most valuable  video I ever seen in  couple of years . Hope big crap apple won't  crush this young company ... glad some are not greedy
Finally!! <3
Linus stop putting us on the tipping point by constantly almost dropping the laptop😰 You are giving me a heart attack here
This is incredible, I really want this company to stay in business
I want that badly. But I'm afraid my Thinkpad E330 is good enough for another 3 years or so. Because it's old and upgradeable.
Shut up and take my money!!!! I NEED one!!!!!! Why did you guys all have to crash their website?????
This laptop is only for enthusiasts. Sad to say it will be nowhere near a successful product.
Inb4 Apple gets jealous and pretends they brought back more I/O ports & swappable parts like it's some R&D miracle.
The random noises over Linus during the Keyboard segment unironically slayed me.
what about performance?
Finally. I can install linux on a PC that isn’t a pre 2010 Lenovo laptop.
This is the kind of company that could start the change in the way other tech companies operate, but only if it can stay in the public eye long and frequently enough to keep peoples attention. This is one of the biggest problems in this area, going up against the likes of Apple who lets face it, only really care about their consumers coming back to buy the same product again every couple of years, by using their vast advertising resources to keep those fans wanting more. I honestly hope they succeed. In a time where we're all having to start being a little more conscious about wasting resources, this is really something that should've been the norm by now!
can't wait for them to supply the UK <3
I’m buying this when my 2015 Mac Pro dies. Thx 🙏
every laptop manufacture TAKE NOTICE!!!
epic stuff. Will they be a public company anytime soon?
this is the first laptop reviewed here that I am actually want
Leaving this comment here, just so I can come back in a decade and prove to my friends that I was here.   The rise of Framework.
Ok, now I have to check out framework's stuff
At last a product that doesn't push the Apple strategy... Framework did really "think out of the box", ;)
I've always wanted something like this!
1:57 " normal day on LTT"
oh my! let me do my part and comment and stuff
The 172 downvotes (as of this comment) are probably butthurt executives of Apple, Dell, Microsoft etc 😂
This laptop, while marketed for everyone, can be a big hit for people in the tech industry. People who know the real worth of the computer components which turns them away from latops but still need the portability.
Before they send something to Linus, should have rechecked if their website can handle millions of traffic. Currently they are under maintenance
This is exactly what I wanted. I always needed to find teardowns of a laptop before I bought one to see if ram is upgradeable, cooling solution is good etc. It is very hard to shop around if you are a conscious buyer and know what you want in the laptop segment. You would be amazed how much difference can be between two laptops with the same i5 cpu. Warranty is not even a good argument anymore, because by the time something actually breaks there will be a little asterisk there saying: "yes we said two years warranty but not for the component that broke on your one" or even if it applies you will have to send it to a depo and spend weeks without a laptop.
If this had a 3060 discrete graphics card or another discrete option. I would buy one RIGHT NOW!
ok linus
Cool idea, but I see them bankrupt in a year or so... :D Hope not...Don't think there are that many people who will appreciate this.
wow !!!! @Apple
And their website is dead
wait... does this laptop not come with windows 10?
Looks like an amazing option for my dad and mom. They normally use their devices for years and years and years. I could easily keep them running like this.
Fuck, I just bought an XPS 13
Y u gotta broken ass phone?! Let me fix
That's pretty cool, if my laptop wasn't like 95 percent just for gaming I'd be all over it.
Thanks Linus you nearly  DDOSed their homepage with your video :D
Steam deck and framework laptop can be the game changers.
Do you want a ddos attack on your site let Linus review your product 🤣
Thinkpad has left the chat
I like it
7:43 many of those ugly 2010 laptops have usb on the back so you don't have to see that cable.
Hope they expand to EU, I want this to be the concept of my next laptop.
im broke asf rn but this is  fs my next laptop
We crashed another site lol
Too bad it's been less than a year since my last laptop upgrade, no way I can justify a new laptop even though I really want this.
i ALWAYS run my laptop off the wall and since it has a built in battery i can't even just remove and keep it aside like my old laptop cause the battery on it stopped working and the laptop was chonky and difficult to move around from my shelf to my table or bed so i could just remove the battery and used it and because i can't do it on a modern laptop i'll have to buy a whole new battery after it swells just so that i don't burn the whole laptop
This is what Alienware tried to do all this years ago before Dell happened, I hope they succeed and continue to exist for a long time and make more different accesories like non US keyboards
Me likey.
16:35 pretty sure that feature is used to turn it on if you build desktop out of the motherboard.
Wow, insanely awesome product and I can see it really doing well if they stay course. I rock a oled blade 15 and I will swap it out for this one in a heart beat when they start offering higher end screens.
Love seeing Linus's genuine excitement at each turn!  Wish I had the means to invest too! This is where I want to vote with my money.
If this was available with Ryzen, and if I had money, I would buy it in a heartbeat.
I really hope laptops become more and more modular.
Everytime LTT reviews positively a product, they get sold out, the website crashes or the prices increase.  Sad. I wish I was faster, the framework website is down.
Looking at selling my razor blade for one of these!!
This laptop is frincking cool! I hope they succeed on this, because I leave in Brazil and have a laptop that up-gradable would be very nice. If I can give feedback, the battery disconnect could be a button or something like that to easily switch on the fly, support for linux also would be nice.  So I think the only thing that stops me to buy it, is the fact that their site isn't loading probably because a lot of people who watched this video is trying to buy one, and of course, the fact that I don't have money 😭. (one day, I swear I'll have this mythological creature called money). Also, hope they will make a pt_br keyboard layout (and framework, if you make a pt_br keyboard with abnt1 layout instead of abnt2 I'll personally kill you 😡).
This looks amazing
But you still have to use their parts to upgrade so you’re always tied down to this manufacture
I think you crashed the Framework website dude.
This looks awesome!
oh noo he said QUEpon again.. i thought madison told you how to pronounce!
I'm pretty sure that the disconnect battery in BIOS is for servicing purposes, and not to save the battery (that would be the stop charging at 50%). It'll be back on once AC is connected (as it does with many laptops with built in battery).
8:37 if only rPGA947 was still used
OK, at this point I've seen this kind of thing a million times and it's invariably disappointing, but as this video progressed, I found myself thinking "I want this for my next laptop". Good job, Framework. Achievement unlocked: bar raised.
Can't find stock info on cash app or else I'd invest in Framework <3
If they come to India, this will be my next laptop and the laptop I would recommend to all my friends and family. Sadly, I bought a ThinkPad last year when my MacBook died and I didn't like its lack of reparability so I opted for the ThinkPad. I hope these guys get all the press and attention they deserve.
I think this product has a lot of potential for profit since anyone who has been following Right to Repair closely knows that the US Military is barely able to service their own equipment. Taking that into mind the possibility of a US contract with various departments would be HUGE for Framework and essentially secure their position as a laptop maker for years to come. It is definitely something for them to look into.
And the packaging looks eco friendly ,mostly cardboard
Damn, I think this video killed frame.works website lol
What a time 🥲
I hate how laptops these days just kinda run out of usefulness. Luckily I was able to turn my old worn-out laptop into a Minecraft Server.
this video made the site of framework crash
This design looks nice. However, I kind of want to see a "thick" model Framework laptop, with compatibility for physical media drives such as DVD/Blu-Ray. Alternatively, you could have a component that replaces the drive with additional ports. Imagine having a full USB hub's worth of ports right on the side of your computer.
Just checked out the site and it took a couple of minutes to load.. assuming the traffic generated by this video hit their servers hard 😂
Well, if it's pcie4 based thunderbolt an egpu would be a good option, but I'd like to see gpu options. A little standardization of mxm modules may be needed first
Ok. Gimme.
I won't be surprised if Lenovo ends up buying or partnering Framework. Though I'm not sure it'll be a good thing or not😶
“If you think your users are idiots, only idiots will use it.” - Linus Torvalds ofc
So good
This video deserves 100M views and people should be more aware that laptops from big brands are made in a way that you buy a new one in 3-5y max.
I would love it with an amd 5xxx series and the mother board is upgradeable with the cpu hopefully they sell those. It's the same as Intel on desktop new cpu and new motherboard
What is the software you use to monitor all the hardwares?
if i had the money i swear i would ve bought one right away !! butt ... . until then, great job guys ❤️
My Thinkpad wants a word with you Linus. It is neither flimsy nor hard to repair. And the Fair Phone might want a word with the Phone version of the argument. It is just all lies so they can sell you a new thing in a few years.
Let this company be the guide for fulfilling all the requests that a customer askes for.....  You have my respect framework.  ALWAYS.
I liked this Linus. Great product and great video. I want one!
11:55 holy shit i almost died of laughter 😂😂
This gives me hope for the future.
I would like to see Anthony run Linux on this laptop. I always have issue getting driver for Linux on laptop, especially 2-in-1. It will be a huge plus if Framework have Linux in mind. I really want to see how the expansion card behaves in Linux as compared to Windows
Hear me out, System 76 and Framework collab.
The website isn't loading so I assume they're doing okay.
11:52 I lost it.
Wow. I really want one
The only thing it's missing is an option for a keyboard with the fn key on the right side of the spacebar, I wrote Framework about it, and sadly they have no plans of offering that type of keyboard in the future. That means that it's a no-buy for me, yes, it wins on every single other thing, but the amount of hours I spend writing on a keyboard, it has to be 100% comfortable, and I just can't do the fn-on-the-left-side keyboards. Hopefully, some 3rd party keyboard will come along and fix that.
If there was a 15" version I would buy it in a heartbeat.
You crashed their website linus!!!!
This thing is fucking awesome
Framework’s website just down?
I have a question : will the framework laptop run MacOs?
Someone send frame.work a link to Network Chuck, someone missed his load balancing video.
this is so COOOL that  I'm 99% sure it will fail. I believe that our society right now does not deserve such blessing. We will find a way to destroy this concept, the same way we destroyed scientific truth and the rain forest.
Add a VOLTA cable in the charger and Tadaa your charger is magnetic too. Super awesome laptop.  It took so long to be a product like this and they nailed it. Take love Framework <3
Stop Juggling expensive hardware Linus !
I love when linus is so impressed that he start swearing
Just 2 months ago I dismantled a 15 year old laptop for parts. I was surprised at how easy it was. Everything (atleast the stuff that's usually supposed to be changed) was labelled and there were even buttons and tabs to help take stuff out. It was so nice taking it apart.  If I ever had to money and a use for a laptop I'd be getting this one no doubt
Alex mentioned gallium nitride chargers only being included with high-end laptops, and I really wonder why. I have a 61w one that I use for my MacBook all the time, and it cost like $22. The concept of this laptop is really cool, and those nifty little type-c swappable modules are epic! I would assume that they could also be used with any laptop with a type-c port, and for sure would be way smaller than any HDMI adapters I’ve seen.
Plot twist: This was a diss on Dell😹
"The monitor is not touchscreen" I finally have a use for that old touchscreen.
Well, the website is down. Should see how long the videos been out next time before trying to check the site.
ohhh...year and a half....and only
I just hope that their server is as easily upgradable as their laptop.. they certainly underestimated our craving for a DIY laptop! I've been looking for something like that for years
I’ll probably buy one when they move over to ARM.
i was thinking about using a laptop that doesn't feel as stagnant as a phone, this is just amazing
I'd like to see the charger port built in on the ne3xt revision, with being able to keep the 4 expansion slots. Other than that, looks freakin solid!
This is what we want
And it has a great webcam!
Looks awesome hope this gets ground fast. Also perfect for trolling a coworker by removing his memory when he is on the crapper.
I have a work laptop and a bunch of personal desktops so I haven't owned my own laptop for a while. I do absolutely LOVE this though! I love the pro consumer philosophy here and I think I want to get this in the very least to support this company. We vote with our dollars right?
wow mind blowing i thing i start to getting a big investor of this firm that's a game changer in the business
I LOVE THIS!
So Dbrand is gonna make skins for this right?
The site of framework seems to be congested.... incredibly slow and is going in "maintenance" every 5 minutes just after the release of this video... product may be popular kids say (lol)
I love it
why the micro center's photo in minute 17:58 had appeared in my dreams before ._.? I have never knew about this place until today .—.
when my macbook dies im buing this.
OMG these guys are price gouging harder than any other company in the industry right now.... is this when the stuff is supposed to be "cheap"? im at $1450 with no ram, wifi, OS, or storage.... yikes. compare this to the M1 Macbook and its not even close dude  RIP this company is DOA
I’m sold. Keeping an eye on them when they reach Europe.
Ok, the Battery disconnect in the BIOS is very impressive!  Hoping they get a mechanical keyboard option someday too.
Nerd is virtually a dead word in 2021, you know, the word that used to mean people who liked PC gaming, computers, tech. However I would absolutely without a second thought go as far as to say this is the ultimate nerdy laptop. It's actually nerdy. I love it so much. This is sick.
Now I want an M1 mac and one of those...
Linus do a collaboration and make an LTT keyboard or skin for it.
these   guys a a lighthouse in the stormy sea of cheap gimickry and propriety.  I will contact them about my idea of a desktop-laptop conbination that can be both, and have a plug-in ascessory "power-mode". in case anyone would be interested.
Nice!
Linus Crack Tips 11:54
okay, this is really cool, and i kinda do want one, but how i will definitly get 1 is with upgradable mobo/cpu/dedicated gpu option. then im sold. though RISC V laptop sounds EPIC, and i might just pull the trigger on that
System 76 could sell this...
I hope their site being really slow is a good sign! :)
why does linus hold tech very dangerously to the point there’s a 50% chance he will drop it
Nice that is what we need love it
The world needs to become anti-apple hardware design. The consumerist culture is just cancer
haha i'm starting college in a few months i went on their website to buy one and apparently so was everyone else
So my hp840 g1 is an ultrabook and has 0 screws to open
Great product! Hoping for graphics card module for gaming 😂
If this actually goes main stream and people actually start buying these even a quarter as much as macbooks this can be FUCKING awesome for the consumers! If I had the money I'd buy this in a heartbeat!!!
Frameworks website after this video - "Framework is undergoing maintenance right now." XD
that's one of the greatest things I've ever seen :o I NEED IT!!!!!!
they need to make a laptop that supports 4lane thunderbolt on pcie 4.0 lanes for external gpus, then im sold
I hope this product makes a killing. This would be a godsend in poorer countries.
I think you crashed their website Linus
So cool
I'm very tempted.  This is the sort of thing the industry should be *forced* to do.  As it currently is, pretty much every manufacturer deserves heavy fines for environmental damage alone.  And voting with our wallets only does so much.  If this is successful, then hopefully they could make a convertible version with Wacom EMR (although the display magnets would have to go). AMD would be nice too.
Only a minute and a half in and Linus is already smacking components. STOP DOING THAT!
I mean, with how much influence Apple has in the industry (see Samsung) maybe *also* tell people they can't have their iPhone ;)
Does it do thunderbolt?
The most positive from Linus so far
Their website must be getting totally SLAMMED! I can't get in. Nice. 👍
You know what? You fuckin sold me on it!
I hate that apple sells their macbooks for very expensive prices but the parts inside of them are garbage
Bold move to go against the planned obsolescence cartel. Hopefully Apple / Dell / Asus Ninjas won't make them commit sudoku.
love it!
I literally want this now even though i don't need a laptop.
Damn no gaming section.
This should be the future.
This looks really great, though I can’t see any dedicated GPUs on their config pages :/ hopefully that becomes a thing
Been waiting for LTT to make a video about this laptop!! So excited for the future of easily repairable and upgradeable products!
No dedicated gpu tho. Kinda ruins it for me. Really compelling offer still.
11:25 omg give me this with arm pls! that would be perfect! But It needs to work with arm linux!
Yeup, Linus crashed the site. Best product of 2021?
Had a smile on my face all thru watching this video! This is what tech should always be about!
and since this video, their wedsite is dead lol
11:50 tho XD
uuhh i ordered a pc with ryzen 3700x palit 3060 16 gb ram tuf b550 pro 750watt psu do you think its gonna be good?
Hopefully this doesn't stay only in this overhyped comment section and it actually becomes a killer product because we've seen good products all along, but they usually don't stay up too long.   High hopes on these guys.
I want this laptop sooooo bad im like "take my money" LOL
Site is still down, bummer
Please guys, make and amd+nvidia machine, I'm buying. I just have really no need for a classic ultrabook.
What about graphics? I see they only offer iris graphics right now.
I saw the iFixit video on this notebook just a couple of hours ago and looked on there website. Now the website is super slow because thousands of LTT viewers want one of these
For those who want to know and can't access the website: framework only takes preorders from US and Canada currently
And here I am, running a 15" Clevo laptop from 2016 that originally came with a Core i5 5700k and a 1060 with a 2070 and a core i9 9900k. Part of that is thanks to the DIY community, but also thanks to the use of off the shelf parts (desktop cpu, mxm graphics, etc.) by the manufacturer (which is far from perfect, particularly when it comes to support, btw). Laptops need standard parts Linus, just like desktops, and this has been possible for a while. The effort this company is making is laudable, but I feel an industry-wide initiative is needed. Unfortunately, that would hurt a lot of bottomlines and is still a ways, a ways off, if it ever comes. Until then.. All the consumer can do is choose wisely and hope for the best.
Just now Dell got sued!!
Yo dawg! I heard you like dongles. So I made dongles for your dongles so you can plug and play while you plug and play.
never  seen Linus this happy
Shut up and take My  money
Would be great to try to make it work as an hackintosh, if it works i am sold 😂
I'm loving everything Framework is doing and has done so far. I hope they stay true and stay the course no matter how hard it gets. Never the less have shared this video link with friends and family. I'm going to wait for a Ryzen variant before buying one... as I need time to save up money lol. Edit: Looks like Framework's website crashed, I hoped they patented the designs as I'd hate for some big brand corpo to hijack this and put them out of the business then revert to churning out b.s unrepairable crap. Second Edit: X570 with Thunderbolt - https://asrock.com/mb/amd/x570%20phantom%20gaming-itxtb3/ So AMD + Thunderbolt is doable.
Your viewers crashed their website!
I need a trackpoint and then we can talk.
I am confused? Who is the sponsor?
Great video and product!
ah yes, the so-many'ed upgradable laptop.  First I will have to see whether they will keep supporting these upgrades before I believe it.
dude this is really cool
This seems cool and all but who's this marketed at?  I'm a power user and I can count the number of times I've needed to open up my laptop in the last 6 years and the upgrade options in this would be just as limited RAM, IO and Storage.
Test external Gpu performance on it plez. I think it'll go a long way of it's good ad has no bottle neck.
Lol. Framework's website exploded. Cannot even connect to it.
Happy with my MSi gs65 stealth but next time I’ll definitely check these guys out
no rgb keyboard?
Why do I remember this device and them already talking about it? It must be unlisted. Or something.  https://youtu.be/XFrJcjCbCA8 Adam Savage also talks about this laptop
Linus broke their website when the video came out.... To much traffic lol... To much hype
Can't wait for these to come to the Uk... Please let them come to the uk
send one to louis rossman PLEASE. He deserves to see something this great
Freaking awesome Framework!!
Yea Framework is down because of linus. Thats what i call marketing.
Linux fingerprint support ♥
Looks like the site got the old Hug O' Death.
Please, please PLEASE gimme an AMD based motherboard for this! I'd even go as far as buying an Intel version now if I knew an AMD platform board would become available later.
Wanted to check out their webpage and seems like all the traffic caused by this video completely clogged their server
I already know what my next laptop is going to be :3
Now exactly how much Pot did you smoke? Linus: 11:54
Man I love this laptop but sadly this laptop is not available in India as of now. I really don't know about the future.
The anti-Apple has come to dwell among us! Repent!
This shit should be the law xD 😂 looove it i miss the old elitebook design too
Why is this only just becoming a thing? It takes a couple of nerds from different manufactures 18 months to create something that should have been around for years. Please take my money.
"Your idiot hands can't repair it!" that made me crack up hahaha
I wonder if once they're established enough, they'd make a chonkier gamer version.
I find it similar to companies that was making modular mouse's, they had lots of interesting ideas like  Mad Cats with there Rat mouse's or swiftpoint model 700..
This is why I refuse to upgrade my mid 2012 MacBook Pro to a newer model one cause of how upgradable it is
finally a laptop with  good camera thats not 720p..look at the quality of it..its awesome
Thats awesome !
Framework seems like the product we dont deserve, but we totally want! I am no laptop guy, but man i kinda wanna buy one, just to support the company so we can help them and make this the standard.
If they do a 2 in 1 with a good pen for drawing, im getting one
This is a good device. It existed *before* right to repair laws. Politicians will take credit for it. (I don't think laws are a good way to achieve things like this.)
RIP website.
I'm going to buy one of this ASAP, fuck anti-consumers brands, finally someone thought beyond programmed obsolecence
this is pretty damn kool.  where is the gamming version??
Bruh I think we crashed their website lol
What have you done Linus. You crashed their website lol. I really need to get one. Not just to support them but that look like a genuinely good product. Reasonably priced too.
This is my dream, id love to see a tablet version though.
interesting product, but here is the big BUT: please redo the sound leveling yours sincerely my headphone wearing bleeding ears
I think Linus took their website down, DDoS. Nice! That's a good sign!
I want one.
Linus, you shouldn't be buying your sponsor segues. The sponsor is supposed to pay *you* for those!
They did a really amazing. It brings to mind, sorry about my memory, of what I think was a Via attempt of doing the same thing with laptops, I think more than a decade ago. If I recall correctly, it was called Deskbooks.
So, is this un-macbook?
You know if its modular like that, in the future u can easily just get motherboard with different CPU and upgrade your laptop that way. Instead of buying totally new laptop
We broke their site, lol
man this and the steam deck have made up for 2020 already
Linus: **explaining** Me:ok but when you gonna drop it? 8:19 not what I was expecting to get dropped but ok
Awesome. I guess I'll have to consider that for my next PC
That laptop is beautiful.
Wonderful! I want one immediately, but have to wait half a year since it is US + Canada only right now. (I am in Europe)
this could be a massive game changer. The fact i could rarely if ever repair my laptop on my own was the reason why i never bothered to get one for Private use. I got multiple over the years from Work... if they are still around next year i might buy one (just invested in a new PC so the laptop will have to wait :P )
heyy wht about the vram and all
It just needs a gpu and I'm sold
It seems like this video upload has broken framework's website.
i would buy one
Gahhhhh I remember that Razer concept... Still haven't stopped wanting it...
Its not a linus vid unless he be dropping something.
I work at a school district that buys hundreds of chromebooks a year, and has to fix the broken ones. The only things you can really replace are the battery, screen, and touchpad (with about 20 screws). Dell likes to glue to the screen to the bezel (with 8 screws), and has 3 layers of tape (and a clip) holding the connector on. That connector came out on one, AND I had to replace the screen because I couldn't remove it without also cracking it.
windows precision touchpad is the worst!! you can't configure it to effectively have a middle button and scroll is a complete disaster, old synaptics is WAY better
God with so many shoddy products that get onto the market, please I hope this quality one lasts.
Annnnd the website is down!
In the future: company gets bought by apple or someone else and vanishes into a vague memory
dude, thats awsome!
AWS = NO CREDIT
Can't even get to the website! I bet they sell a lot of laptops from this video...
Been looking for a laptop for work, Im sold.
Aliexpress has a huge opportunity for this....
silver was a bad choice though.
Linus crashed their website
For me its too generic looking. But what excites me is that ot doesnt have to be that way!
If i wasn't happy with my ThinkPad t490 id buy this s
If there was a laptop id buy this would be it.
I can't wait till they start putting the ryzen apu in these!
Can you charge it from both the left and right sides?
THIS IS AWESOME
If they do a 2 in 1 or a stylus friendly tablet, they'll definitely have me as a customer.
Superb, they can go like beats were costumize extreme and it was a big hit. Nowadays even as simple as keyboard are getting costumized
You crashed their website LOL
Website down. Good job. 😁 Something similar happened after Linus mentioned about Folding @ Home and the Folding servers responsible for issuing protein pieces to fold went on a meltdown.
That's one of the best webcam images I have seen.
For me the battery disconnect and pull power from the wall feature is the most important thing I've ever seen. Most gaming laptops have to be plugged in to make full use of their power anyway, but they keep charging and discharging the battery, and destroy it's lifespan. I cannot wait to get one of these.
I might need to buy one of these laptops in the future if they came out with like an industrial version, like the old Toughbooks. Also did Linus attach the WIFI wires backwards at 9:26? Louis Rossmann also really seemed to love reviewing his unit.
This shit belongs on the NASA Space Station..
Just wow. Make fanless one on arm with chrome os. :D
I like this, a lot! I really hope this is here to stay...
I work in the IT dept in a high school, and this laptop would make it so much easier to repair and make life easier for me, when kids drop them or brake something on em, hats off to frameworks
im buying this. I support this 100%
I want to support this company purely because of how much support they offer to the end user. I don't even care about the performance of the machine anymore.
I have been waiting for a company to come through and make a product that is actually repairable. Give them enough money to market and make the product good, and you are a recipie for why people would wanna get your laptop and only yours. That will eventually force big companies to adapt that style and as a whole the ecosystem is back to how it should be when things were repairable. Look at tesla interms of electric cars. Same case.
this is cool
I'm sold.
Only an hour in and the website already crashed from this LOL
i think you crashed their website, so many people wanting to see more.  just goes to show how many people are sick of todays build standards and want control of what they pay for.
As soon as there's some way to connect a GPU, probably with AMD's mobile RTX chips whenever that happens 😂 I'll be getting one of these.
The only thing missing here is a motherboard with discrete GPU and they got another sale.
"Completely upgradable"  but you can't upgrade the CPU or graphics card..... click bait much?
I'm shocked how good this is.
Apple look! this is how to build less e-wast devices!!! And all other companies hold up you gonna lose, this is for the future! and i am thrilled to buy this for work in our companie my boss will love it!!
I think this video killed the website
First the steam deck now this, consumers are winning again!
Cries in mac
I love it!
im sold
I'm sold... But it's not available in the UK yet
Presumably, you could build a CPU/Mobo module that could fit in the same size area and make that a swappable unit as well.
Dell is straight vomit garbage thats for sure.
That laptop's camera is about as good as my phone's in terms of image quality (I have Motorola One Action).
What a great product! wow the amount of thought that went onto this
Looking for the follow up: Performance Benchmarks.
I want to see Linus reviewing this laptop later on as an daily laptop for work and other stuff
My laptop is very repairable and isn't far off the size of a macbook lol
This reminds me of project Ara :( hopefully this one pans out !
We broke their website
For my point of view, i want to see  options in CPU , a full powered CPU , whiteout need to purchase a laptop with a gaming o profesional graphics. For when you need a good muscles for the job and don't want to expend in a GPU that going to be underused
This is a very cool concept. But the thing that worries me is the can it last for 8 years. The “finish” of polished notebooks is not only about visuals, but also about durability. This might not be as durable. Then again, if something breaks, you can fix it. But still, I’m curious.
this whole video was just linus being a fangirl....What a doll <3
if they get into  steams handheld ecosystem system  i will  100000%  buy something from them
lol there website is down!
Their website is literally crashing
I've never been sold harder on a company in my life
Can I get that in europe?
Taking away serviceability from the user has NEVER been about making sleeker designs and ALWAYS been about making sure you, the consumer, do not own the thing you paid for. Steve Jobs (who has never been anything but a salesman) lied to you.
Paper packaging... great product. Shut up and take my money!
Really hope this is a success, as I currently look to buy a phone which has incrementally removed its removable batteries, its removable storage and its headphone Jack. This should be illegal in an environmentally aware world.
Cannot wait for the company to be bought by one of the big ones and crushed so that no one ever tries this again. Capitalism is so fun....
Sony watching this product should be furious :)
No upgradability, BIOS locked. I remember when I found an unlocked bios for my acer laptop in 2012 and I was finally able to set gpu memory size. I could finally play PES with friends at normalish fps. My latest laptop is as any difficult to upgrade. Lenovo even hid memory under a tin box, no thermal dissipation purpose. And, of course every laptop I open is like playing minesweeper. Thank god for Indian guys on youtube.
I LOVE IT. This will be my next laptop, I just want to support them.
I want to live in a world where even the cooling system is modular.  Imagine getting to chose between thin and hot or big and cool.
This is the first time in my life I have genuinely considerd buying a laptop, besides the laptop I had to have for school.
You mean that manufacturers have been giving us bullshit for years? No way!  Edit This modular approach is very interesting.  Let's say you have to do a presentation, just put in a video output module and you're set. No need for a dongle. If the next day you need the storage just remove the video output and put the storage.
If you have thos magnetic USB C cables you can make it a magnetic charger. Really all they would need to do is recess the port a bit and allow you to put in the slot and use it that way.
I too want this, with a touch screen.
Lol imagine spending time documenting how to upgrade/repair it for no one to read it 😅
I'm presuming you can't get RTX chips for it?
Make a 15.6" touchscreen version with a 360 degree hinge to use it as a tablet or in tent mode, 8 expansion slots (at least 4 of them with full thunderbolt support), and nobody will never ever buy a desktop PC again, period.
They are the one that care about end user. Apple and other company think about business only
No AMD option, no deal.
congratulations Linus you made them sound so good you crashed their website
It's like the phoneblocks, but for laptop :-p Plus that spare screws are like the spare buttons available on our long sleeves shirts and pants all this time :-p
Holy crap this is REALLY cool. Its so f*cking good, its a wonder why its taken so long for someone to do. Its awesome.
hopefully they come up with some larger models like a 15" or 17"
finally a video I can give a like. good job ltt
a SATA port will be a great idea
The site is under maintenance :(
I don't exactly have a ton of cash to spend, I'm a teen saving for college, but this laptop is so neat that, when my 6 year old 3rd gen I3 HP pavilion becomes %100 obsolete, I AM BUYING ONE. $1000 is a lot to spend on a laptop, but considering it is actually competitive and supports what I believe in, I will bite the bullet. All of the issues Rossmann pointed out have been solved, this product rocks
Very compelling. Anybody know speaker performance?
immediately after linus launched this video their website is brought down man that company just got seriously rewarded for listening to customers lol. just imagine if the big prebuilds followed this business model.. Does framework have a stock symbol yet?
Yep. Linus crashed their website. Hehe. Really looking forward to Framework being made available in Australia.
Big fat Steam library on an integrated GPU? Jokes aside, this laptop looks awesome and if I wasn't such a hardcore Mac(OS) user - I would switch - no doubt about it.
Site is in maintenance 😕
I like it, but its not exactly budget friendly.  Still close to $2k for a laptop i specd, i didnt even go highend and didnt even include windows license.. not cheap thats for sure.
Y is framework under maintenance now😭
While I still Don't really like Laptop's, (For Gaming), it's a HUGE Step Towards, To MAKING a PC, YOUR OWN! Again! (Not something to Throw Away). My Desktop PC Case has Had MOST of it's 8 Year OLD, Useless HDD Bay's & crap Thrown away, FOR Airflow! BUT when I put the Side Panel Back on, Boom, All My Football (AFL, I'm an Aussie), and CPU and GPU Sticker's Are Still THERE! showing the Timeline of Upgrades. & IT'S MINE!
"it's not impossible, but it sure is less profitable" -every laptop and gadgets manufacturers
lol I think you killed their website, it's "undergoing maintnance" right now
A little recessed USB plug would be great so you plug your mouse in without the dongle getting broken.
I'll fund them when they release an actual gaming version
Cant wait to have the money to buy one of these, it's so great
11:54 Fan girl mode on <3  *screeeeeeams
I'm not tech savvy but if this thing can utilize an external GPU set up for gaming it would be an easy buy.
Apple, take notice - this is way ahead done right. First time in a good while when I truly consider switching. Could this work as hackintosh?  If so, and performs decently enough, never mind the next round of MBPs.
Lol the Framework site crashed.
And Linus has gone back to pronouncing "Z" in the American manner.  My comment about welcoming Linus back to Canadian English did not age well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yR_tGnFyhY&lc=Ugws_A1G8y7zmOB4LP14AaABAg
oled panel !
What makes this a completely upgradeable laptop?  Other laptops give you the ability to replace the Memory, Storage, screen, keyboard, trackpad, battery, etc, etc.  The only "special" thing this laptop has is a built in usb type c dock.
It's like back in the day, when you used to get an electrical diagram/schematic with your transistor radio! But with QR Codes and cad drawings! haha
This is the most beautiful piece of tech bc it's repairable and upgradable ANNNDD provides information and documentation for said parts.  This is my next laptop. I'm gonna start saving up NOW.
I want one...
This is exactly what happens when engineers properly design a product without accountants sticking their noses in it. My next laptop is guaranteed to be one. No contest.
I really want these laptops to go mainstream
Their business model is similar to companies like Xiaomi. They intentionally make a low-profit margin on their smartphones and laptops; but, they make the majority of their profit margin from accessories. This allows them to get more customers on board while also building a brand and a reputation.
I want one
Man please don't do this to me, my laptop is still working fine
I want to see this company do something with System 76. Imagine the collaboration they could pull off.
I’m in love, I hope the final product will be the same ! Imagine a Dbrand partnership with framework….
Your friend testing out his new camera be like 15:10
11:53 Who edited this? I MUST KNOW
i would love to see :  more port slots in some bigger, more powerful version, (maybe mount some behind lcd?)  maybe plug in mxm slot with premade one-fit-all cooler that would slot right in.   more variety of ports like rs232, lpt, full sized ethernet, modem, 1394, expresscard reader, eSATA, memory card reader, security card reader, encrypted key, video IN (hdmi/dp or whatever to  connect for example external gpu or console direclty), better sound card, additional battery pack or maybe even ps/2 ports  add slots connected by pcie to add normal expansion cards outside when you're stationary with possible eDP passtrough from main screen to connect external gpu
It gives me goosebumps to see how Linux holds the entire laptop by a corner totally opened 180 degrees 😰
Finally we got a boss laptop.💯
Nice save
As a recent (stupid) owner of "laptop killer (not)" called iPad Pro 2021, which turned out to be a scaled-up iPhone with infuriating limitations, I'm so getting this. Companies like that need to get all the love I can spare.
THE DELL IS NOT EVEN F***ING THINNER! XD  14:17
Review so positive it made the site crash
Linus’s phones cracked!  Oh nooo!
I hope our laptop guy @Dave2D covers this too!
Gotta support this product and company, I'm sick of seeing good-guy startups, like this, go out of business in six months.  I'm eagerly awaiting the "after a few months of use" review
Impressive
This is really cool!! ❤️ But damn the website’s crashed!
Would Linux support be an issue here?
This is simply one of the best tech products available.
This company should rise above all the big ones!
HOLY shit guys, slow down, their site is bogged down due to high traffic!
Modules
8:09
00:03 As a Lenovo T-series (T420 blaze it) owner, I'd like to disagree with that statement.
wow
How much
this is fucking fantastic honestly
First batch already sold out and website swamped with users, this is amazing for the industry and I hope it causes a trend from other companies. Imagine competition for how many different customizabilities your laptop has.
"THE DELL'S NOT EVEN F*CKING THINNER!" lol
This is so simple, yet so effective, I really like this laptop
Really more companies should get on this idea. After spending 2000-3000 on a laptop. You aren't going to convince me to plot down about $2000 because you added a touchbar and locked out my system from updates.  But you could convince me to buy modules at $50 to $200. Oh what's that you partnered with Disney to bring me an MCU keyboard? Well that's worth a look.  From an IT standpoint, it's going to be easier to justify spending $1000 on modules that should get replaced often then one person who wants a Mac.  My question is of course recycling. I'm not going to want certain modules if I get a upgraded version. Can I send them in?
I have seen a number of videos like this but I have never seen the creator actually going out and buying the product. I am sold too!
I will buy the Zen 4/RDNA2(3?) version of this. Until then my 3230qm/660m laptop still works fine-ish.
I really like the concept! If I were looking for a laptop, this would be a contender. What I would have wished though, is the inclusion of more ports. Right now, only 4 I/O ports can be added of which 1 NEEDS to be USB-C basically. What I find weird is that there is no Type-C port built into the device (taking up less space than a card would) since you're gonna need one anyway. Also, no Ethernet card (yet) which I personally would love to have. I would want a configurable laptop to avoid living the "dongle life", but with a fairly small amount of ports, you'd still kinda have to.   Second M.2 or 2,5" drive option (with smaller battery) would also have been a nice option, but i totally see why they didn't do that. I would, however, prefer not spend one of my 4 precious ports on a USB Storage device.  Though the above might not sound very positive, I am actually really happy to see laptops like these being made! I hope this concept becomes popular, so they can iterate on this and make it even better! Great (Frame)work!
Haven't seen Linus jazzed up at that level for a while! This concept is just the best ! I'd love to have one like this ! So rad !
I’m in the market for a new laptop or pc, and now I’m sold on buying this sweet baby
man got to like the video just so more people can see this want to give the product support even if I don't use laptops
Can you please „hackintosh“ this?
my dream laptop damn
How is it possible I never read about these guys anywhere. This company is AWESOME
I use my Samsung Oddessy still rocking hard with RTX 2060 32gb ram! Perfect for my travel and go.
This is amazing! If they can keep their promises and don't just disappear this is a very admirable company policy towards  repairability and innovation! I wish them a lot of success and hope once I'm not broke I can buy one of their products too!
https://youtu.be/0rkTgPt3M4k?t=651 does Linus realise that he can get a new mobo (with the soldered in CPU), then plug all the current parts in to it? So the parts being modular makes the whole thing upgradeable?  Also, https://archive.is/WrF5e is an archive of the website.
Man Linus you crashed the damn website ( ╹▽╹ )
Modularity - who cares?  An extremely interesting product.  On a sort of off topic, the LG G5 mobile phone tried to create a modular device and it pretty much got them nowhere. The reason being, they came up with a solution to a problem that no one was aware of.   On the note of right to repair, this design would definitely score them an A+  in terms of design and repair; however for the average consumer, the merits of its design is as important as the LG G5's design approach  in that, it's something people could care less about.  Nonetheless, if the modularity could extend to upgradable GPUs - which I know require extra thermal and power consideration than simply plugging in a smallish, square box to the side - then you'd have much more compelling argument that would in fact bring people on board.
Now if MKBHD can also do a video to get maximum consumer coverage
I have to say, I was about to buy one THIS SECOND. No Ryzen CPU tho, no framework laptop for me. Sad, my dream just got crushed :(
11:35 I don't get the Dell hate. Their pc insurances are pretty upgradable, you can even use multiple at once
Laptop dlc when
I love all your skits linus
Wow, im really annoyed that I just bought a Vivo Book flip. What an amazing business model
the website is down lmao
This is the second video I have watched on this laptop and if I was in need of one, I would definitely purchase this one. It looks like they thought of everything.
That absolute Pog face for the keyboard and the “It’s not even f*cking thinner!” comment. Hilarious. 😂
Tbh I love the idea, I also think it'd make a great educational device, since while you're upgrading or customizing it, that you can also learn more about the intricacies of how things run and how they connect, etc, obviously with help from the QR codes.  Great for wanting to learn more about laptops/computers.
Dedicated GPU ??
100% this is my next laptop. I'm not looking right now since the 10 y/o Acer on Linux mint that works for what I do, but I'm extremely glad this exists and I hope it succeeds
Stop with the masks!
Ex-Lenovo guys? No wonder the first thought I had was "Is this a Lenovo IdeaPad?". xD Now the price question: Does it have clips besides the screws? I hate clips... and my IdeaPad would be quite easy to open if not for the clips.
Just wanted to look and see if they ship to Germany, site is down lol. does anybody know though?
wow this video must've be great for them. they're website is bugging out 😂
Ok I'm sold. I want this now! Pog
I have never wanted to sell my current laptop this badly, this is exactly what I want from a laptop!
This is really cool and reminds me of the Fairphone. I wish them good luck, we need more manufacturers like this in the world.
Looks like a dell xps 13 laptop
Holy shi this might start a REVOLUTION 🥰🥰🤘🔥🔥🔥
Dell is just a to-early-born child
I was just talking about that laptop today :|
a hardware switch to use the battery or only use the power outlet would be amazing
This is a big Game changer ! I hope to see major companies start doing this. I remember google or microsoft making a fully modular cellphone but then they scrapped the idea. I hope this isnt another example of the same case
Well the site is down.. thanks LLT viewers 🤭
I think framework is effectively getting ddossed now cos you didn't mention any prices so we're all running through the configurator!
Was just about to buy buy the site crashed
Ordering one now
If I ever need a laptop again, I think this is the route I'm gonna go
16:57 fired
If nemesis was a laptop
Ha! Looks like it got the hug of death  I wish I knew about this when I was shopping for laptops earlier this year! If something happens to this one, you can be sure I'll check em out if they're still around
I Love this so much and IT IS so amazing. Hope this is still around in some years wegen i have to get a new laptop
They should make motherboard and cpu upgradable.
Its one of everything I ever wished for 7 years ago when I was 9
But the real question is, where is the 3090 ? If it's not a gaming-product, GTFO WITH THIS BULLSHIT USELESS SHIT! RAAAWRRR !!
If the some models are usb c then cant they be plugged into newer phones?
(11:53) That is just too fracking funny! I had to rewatch this a bunch of times, laughing maniacally the entire time. Thank you. I needed that. 😃
It would be funny if Framework pretty much becomes the next big computer company.
Thanks linus you broke framework
Imagine this product becoming super popular, creating a demand from upgradable CPUs, resulting in either AMD or Intel making something available for the same.    It would be a win win situation for Framework and the chip manufacturers.
The more I hear the small features of this laptop (I love the color-coded screws) the more I think I'm dreaming.    I need to hide my wallet.  EDIT 2: I tried to configure a computer on their website, and while I was configuring it, the website experienced slow load times with the selections, then reloaded to a maintenance page. Congratulations LTT viewers. We've crashed a website.
They should collam with sensel for an even better trackpad
I can't wait for a future Raspberry Pi powerful enough to be most people's desktop computer.
For the editor that worked on this video and is responsible for 11:52 You should get a raise.
This is literally the FIRST time that I WANT to buy a product after watching a review. Amazing and honest review by Linus for an awesome and well designed product
Looks like you crashed their website :) The Linus Love is brutal :)
The option of running it off wall power is what i need, i hate the times that im doing something intensive for a long period of time and i have to recharge 2 cycles, its just killing the batery
Yeah that is annoying companies trying to make it harder for people to take apart their own device you might as well say that you own 75% of the electronic , if you don’t know how to take it apart.
their website crashed
11:52 LOL
Guys waste your money right there it's a good investment!   Better than burning them for HP or Dell
I need to replace my recently broken laptop, but don't think I'll take the plunge on this one yet. I'm really curious if Linus still recommends it after a daily driving it for a while, however
SOLD!!!!
Will have to try to remember these guys in 5-7 years when I'll update my laptop..
@dbrand better start working on skins guys
I don’t need a new laptop but I still wanna give them money for the fuck of it just so they can keep this work going. This is one of the things this world lacks and needs. Definitely can see how this saves on e-waste when upgrading individual parts as opposed to just tossing the whole machine
Lol pinebook pro go brr
If you can't upgrade the CPU and GPU, then it's far from "completely" upgradeable, after some years it'll become slow/unusable...
I think I'm in love
This is awesome. I hope they succeed at this
So It's upgradable like the PowerBooks from the 90's which also had motherboard update kits. We've went full circle
Those bios power options really scream "repurposing the motherboard as a cheap-but-efficient-and-performant NUC" after you eventually upgrade. The attention to detail even on end-of-life concerns is fantastic.
We need powerful gpu.
Dang, this laptop has been a fever dream of mine since I was a kid. Legit do google searches at least once a year to see if someone made it.
I hope they are around the next time i need a laptop, really like the concept. Also, they should do a dual type c module.
Awesome video! However, Linus your kinda looking like a hobo….. grab the clippers MGK his fcuking beard is weird. 🤣   BTW, when is Anthony doing another PC build guide like his famous RGB one?
I wish people actually buy it
Ryzen 9/3080 and you've got my purchase!
Lmao we crashed the site
They'd better do a workstation/DR laptop that way next
I just found my next laptop!
first latop  i would ever consider buying fcng amazing product!! if u ever trade ur desktop or need anything more mobile then a regular desktop this is the way to go.. seriusly thinking bout buying one of these, apreciated the review linus awsome work  thank you sir
Man, I recently bought myself a new laptop. I feel so sad right now :( This looks awesome!
Brilliant
I guess you could also use one of those desktop GPU docks w/thunderbolt for gaming if you wanted? Sufficient speed from the USB-C?
Nice Just NICE, just a bit small, the screen can be bigger like 19", and the temperature can be less, finally something good on the market
Here is one thing i dont get....Why thin? whats wrong with chunky bigass tons of sockets around the thing! what happened to that?
I don't need a laptop at the moment, but not only will I buy one of these when I *do* need a laptop, I might just buy one anyways. Can't say for sure yet thanks to the hug of death lol
Linus shaking that laptop around made me worried. He handles it like it is an old toughbook.
lml yall  crashed the site
This thing is actually awesome. If I needed portability I'd buy this hands down
Well you see, this philosophy can't be adopted by companies like Apple because then they wouldn't be worth multiple billions of dollars and we absolutely can't have that
Seeing that something like this is possible but no one does it out of pure greed just makes me sad :(
I don't even need a laptop but I'm getting one too! I love to se companies that actually care.
This thing is basically a desktop PC, miniaturized into form-factor of laptop. Even the motherboard is really easy to replace. I just hope the support of this product is long enough to attract 3rd party accessories.
This concept Needs to succeed!
I want this so badly
This makes me excited for laptops again.  The way computers were as a kid and desktops still kind of are.  Only it comes with instructions for dummies (like me) :-)  In the future if I need one this is the place I'd look to.    What has put me off getting things like a new tablet or even considering buying a new laptop when I needed one a few years back, is how less and less repairable they have become over time and the initial cost and then having to expense to replace the whole thing so soon because something went wrong.  It isn't worth the expense of getting such an item.   When it isn't your daily driver.  I'd rather live with the inconveince of using a memory stick (thumb drive)  and just used the desktop at home then take it to work with me and use it there when needed.  Or having to sent the info a client or friend wanted, later once I was at a pc.  And spend that money on something I make more use of.  In many laptops and even tablets could cost half the price of a decent desktop, which is nuts.  I hope this takes off for them. This is a great idea and one can see it is well thought out.  Many of the other modular deigns of electronic goods, I've seen over the years,  the idea was there, but it had something missing or it wasn't really as practical as intended.  This looks great :-)
This looks great, id like to see how maxed out this thing can be upgraded to.
Great video Linus. Thanks for continuing to push R2R
Finally..... i can upgrade without completely disassembline my computer.v
I'd like to buy this, but i almost never leave my home, so what's the point?
its called pr bullshit they got rid of headphone jacks to get you to buy bluetooth headphones they got rid of wall plugs to get you to buy the new type c one cause lets face it if they did it for the enviroment like they said then why did they do it now when they just changed it to type c which nobody has cause its new they could of changed it at any time over the past like 10 years cause we all have usb plugs everwhere so it would not of mattered if they got rid of it earlier so thats bulshit and not being able to upgrade of minimal upgrades or no repair is greed give us your money bitches
give me a gaming one that can have the gpu replaced every 3 years or so and ill be ordering that in a heart beat
Wonderful
You need a USB-C module, thats connect to a USB-C port, to conect a USB-C charger?
Yes! Thanks for the great review LTT!
Linus get excited about a screw driver what came with the laptop
I doubt this will ever exist but I wish I could plug in more ram to my computer or laptop like instead of a WD passport I can just plug in an extra 32gb of ram
Just join them to make the product even more upgradeable!
Not to mention, ifixit will have a tear down tutorial for this laptop most likely
Honestly, i wish their sales EXPLODE because thats so good!!
Glossy screen? Really???
Wow, did your launch of this video take down their website?
If this thing flexed (turned into a tablet using that 360 hinge and a touch screen I would have literally bought it right then and there (need a laptop for note taking)
GALLIUM CHARGER.... IM DROOLING LIKE MY NEANDERTHAL ANCESTORS DID WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THEY CAN COOK FOOD OR SOME SHIT
Gamers when they find out their notebook is pre built:
Haha upgrades go brrrrrr
Cool, now please give it to Anthony and give it a Linux shakedown!
Gonna order one once theres less people tryna access the site
And I *had* to get a new laptop in November… I mean, yes, it was absolutely necessary, my old machine booted up in about as long as it would take me to turn on the new one, open Firefox and watch this video in .25 speed. But I'm still mad.
WOW just amazing laptop hope to see Ryzen CPU motherboards for this soon this would be perfect laptop for me as I take really good care of my laptops and don't like changing to new laptops I am autistic so don't like changing my hardware vary tempted to order one wonder how  keyboard compares to think pad T41P is my favorite laptop I have still working and almost mint  This could also be good to people that are abusive/hard on there laptop if all the parts are available case hinges screen at affordable prices would be great for schools maybe they could even do a more rugged version of laptop with the same parts   overall super cool repairable design could reduce E-waste a lot hope to see them become a huge laptop brand cause every thing about the laptop looks amazing
Is the screen replacable? I think it would be cool if you could buy a screen replacements for this thing that has better resolution, screen type or have additional features such as touch screen. It would be just like buying a new monitor for a desktop.
Frameworks website is barley working
I really wished companies mainstreamed such laptops in the market. That way it would drop their prices and repair costs by so much. Not to mention increasing longevity and reducing e-waste
0:27 (sigh!) again... You Americans (and Canadians, by extension)... "Performant" is NOT a real word.   Thanks
I would love to see hackintosh on it like "F U APPLE, we just build our own macbook how WE want"...
garbage
I'd like a laptop with the trackpad to the right instead of centered.
The site seems very slow and I question the JavaScript implementation because of it. Its a form where you need to wait for a full reload every time you changed something.
ThinkPad been a lot quite since this video dropped huh. Well I guess it's justified since the current gen are not that good(FIX THE DAMN FAN POSITION)and the old thinkpads are getting older and it's only a matter of time for the T480. Meanwhile this looks like a really good option which I would buy if this was available here.
I like the changeable ports.. I don't need a video port normally, i'd rather the extra USB, but when vacation time comes and i know i want to plug it into the hotel TV, swapping out the port is far better then a dongle.
the laptops are selling so damn fast
These framework guys are straight from the Heaven.
now i want to buy one but linus crashed their website XD
Awesome concept made reality! I would love to see them offer a gaming laptop with this same philosophy.
I've never seen a modular piece of tech catching up... they always stop making them soon after release lol starting to think it's a money laundering scheme
That's incredible, not to mention the environmental benefits from not needing to having to buy a full laptop everytime something breaks. I'm sold.
really cool laptop :o danm i want one now ... god danm it !!!
Ok, in the past every attempt at modular devices was crap in my opinion but this legit seems like an excellent laptop, definitely will consider it when its time to upgrade, and it is not the fact that you can upgrade it but that you can FREAKING REPAIR IT if something does happen, I usually don't upgrade my devices I kinda overspec them a bit so it last 5-8 years on laptops and desktops and 3 years on phones and then sell it and get a new one but knowing that and accident doesn't mean I need a complete new device really is a plus
Nice nice nice. 👍
How about the GPU?
Apple - *phones lawyers sobbing down phone*
I wouldn't even have a use for a laptop right now and I want one of those! It's incredible, I'm all for it!
Broke the website :D
FFFFUUUUUUTTTTTUUUUUREEEEE
1:39 Sad no Linus Drop Tips
AAAAAND you crashed their Webpage.
Alex will be single very soon.
Bro im just tyrna pre order this please stop crashing the site :((((((((
ok now this is cool as sh*t
Those excuses never held any water. The tiny iPhone 4 & 4S are incredibly easy to work on, they all are up to  the 6S, after which they began many shenannigans. Macbooks became difficult to work on in sync with iphones, perhaps a little sooner.
Please make a gaming laptop
14:17 damn, the Dells not even thinner. Wtf is the point of such tight integration then?
THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE NEED!!!
11:52 thanks for that nightmare fuel
I HAVE WAITED FOR THIS LAPTOP ALL MY LIFE!
Awesome idea, too few ports for my needs. My Thinkpad (which is still somewhat upgradable, though not as much as this one) has more ports, but I still daily use all of them and wish I had more USB ports.
Couldn't a laptop motherboard manufacturer simply design a motherboard with a horizontal plug to connect an additional section of motherboard to existing motherboard? For example, solder the GPU to the motherboard sure but to the detachable segment of motherboard? Just sort of slot in an extra chunk of motherboard?
12:08 voice crack
That is the best webcam I have ever seen
11:53 You glitched into the backrooms
When Linus is ordering something while making a video that's how I know that's a good product
8:38 What a shame. I got 7 year old laptop with a Haswell-era G3 socket. Go backwards to go forward I guess? Swapable GPUs and CPUs next pl0x.
I love the modular I/O ports on this thing lol
This is definitely gonna blow up, it has everything we need and wanted our whole lives, Linus reviewed it, they have a simple URL for a website...And the website is under-maintenance already because of Linus.
Wow .... I am impressed !
Website is down HAHAHAHAHAHAHA So many people want one that the whole website is barely working HAHAHAHAH I love it XD
I love this... I hope they have upgradable  motherboards
I waiting for the Big Techs to collude in getting people to have bad experiences with this product to preserve their narrative. Anyway, I think this will be my new laptop.
11:30 lol
LMG got so addicted, they started buying segways to the sponsors
Every laptop should have upgradable ram and storage
Linus... those "magnetic charger connector clones" have allready existed for a few years...  Ali Express is full of it.
I've been repairing computers for almost 20 years and wow do I miss the days where you could actually open up laptops with hardly any work. I am excited about this concept! seems I'm not the only one.. You crashed their website! :D
very good luck to the team at framework.. :)
14:02 - “That is NOT an unreasonable amount of flex.” <— Really hope we see this clip used in future cutaways… lol
12:44 "and has linux drivers" thats it THATS IT SAY NO MORE TAKE MY FUCKING CASH
When I need to get a new laptop, I know which one to buy.
This is very satisfactory.. now I'll wait for the mobile phone one 🥰
I think this video may have crashed their site everytime I try to click on it it says it down for maintenance
Clicks on link "Site undergoing maintenance" 🤔 LTT fans break another site 😅
I would like to send Framework $100 under the name of Tim Cooky
Yo LTT, Zotac came out with magnus one series, now with rtx 3000 series GPUs. Would be amazing if you could check it out.
Good job. Their website is done! Yaaaay?
I love the idea!!!!!!! I really wish we could have upgradable processors and motherboards though. I'm still rocking a 2009 HP pavilion laptop  and I upgraded the processor, hard drive, and memory 2 years ago. I'm looking to get a new laptop soon and I have been really pissed lately with these new machines that lack the necessary ports and upgradability. I hope we get more of these in the future
Not gonna lie, that's pretty dope and customer friendly. If only all companies acted like this...
Honestly just glad my non repairable laptop broke in its free one year warranty
This thing looks amazing... good to see pro-consumer stuff like this.  The fact I can't change my battery on newer iphones and androids is criminal!
LLT  crashed website
Apple is not a innovation company after Steve jobs.  It’s a luxury company
We're slowly getting there. The next step (or perhaps giant leap) would be to upgrade the laptop CPU and GPU, but we're getting there already.
I need me one or five of those laptops.
Lol when I can't get on Frameworks website. I think a lotttttt of people are interested.
One of the few tech companies I actually WANT to give my money.
Imagine the options you would have when there are third party accessories
I'm all about this, but this doesn't even have Thunderbolt.... it's just USB. If it had TB, this would be an instabuy for me, but I need TB for my eGPU.
whenever I see a computer case I want to by it cause mine sucks but no i will not
When I found out the dell I was given as a present has upgradable ram and storage I let out THE LONGEST SIGH OF RELIEF.....but my gpu/cpu can only be upgraded in the same gen 😭
people who made this sudently died from piano falling on them in a basement
If they can offer upgraded boards and maybe dedicated GPU option ill buy one. Really love the design, would love to see them expand the platform and off actual upgrade paths as well as replacement parts on their website. New screens, batteries, modules, keyboards. When i buy a laptop i don't leave it untampered. I had to pull this bullshit tissue paper out of my asus that asus put in that was cashing a fan whine and my cpu to thermal throttle. Its bad enough they soldiered one set of ram to the board but you intentionally gimped my laptop. I love this because they want you to crack the thing open and do stuff your self.
I did have a laptop with a socketed CPU, back in 2011, but the GPU shared the cooling pipe and was not replacable, so it wasn't really achieving anything upgrade-wise.  As others have commented, a modular internal gpu would be wonderful, but I don't know of any available that they could've incorporated, so maybe APUs would be a better approach for modular processors.
thing is tho everything except batteries benefit from being soldered onto the PCB you failed to mention that
I love this
That's totally badass.  I really like that idea.  I like the idea to that maybe if the screen breaks, you have a true source to replace it as well.
Ahm, you kinda brought the site down with this video^^
Not UK.
But does it have a full size ethernet port?  I hate that my work laptop doesn't have one. I'm a network technician....
I would love to buy stock in this company. also I am probably going to return my laptop i just got to buy one of these if in can.
Linus needs to buy these for the entire company and have a sponsorship deal with them. They seem like a great ally for right to repair.
I guess that I know what imma do with my next wage uwu
We crashed their site ... Wow. Framework, take my money!!
Their website broke haha, Linus Hug of Death is even worse than reddits.
Maybe i am picky, but, you have just 4 slots?
website is down lol nice job linus
This video crashed their website. :P
This is amazing. I have been wanting to make something like this for years but just never have had the knowhow of where to start. It is fantastic to see this come up in my lifetime and hope the idea gets pushed forward to other technologies such as phones.
Dude you crashed the site!
Next time I am Buying a Laptop I will remember this
Looks like shit..... no DVD drive pffft. I like thick laptops give me those ports and DVD rom.
I think linus made their website not work
after this video is up, Framework's website is down
yup, I'm buying one
14:12 had me laughing hard  15:26 is good too!
Super tempting concept, if only it wasn't Intel based. AMD APU's would get a lot more of my "need mobile gaming to live" money. The fact that I don't need to pay them for memory or storage if I already have that is great. I'm curious what the modules cost, but given the fact that the system's so hammered I can't even make it that far to look at it, I'll have to continue wondering. In future when they've got more options for CPU I might very well be heading this road.  I defiantly love the concept. 2/3'ds of the USB ports, and the keyboard, are the only issues with my current laptop. But I can't fix any of that readily because it's a nightmare to access the keyboard and it's welded in place.  The idea of just being able to...buy a new keyboard. And new USB ports. And a new battery? Hopefully a new main board and keep a perfectly viable case for upgrade after upgrade?   Man. I hope they last and I hope they keep to that concept.
Been eyeing this for the last few months but I wanted to some of YouTube Tech to have a go with it first. Linus is all of us with his reactions to this thing. I really want this product and the company to succeed.
Now that's the next laptop I'm going to buy. If prices are reasonable.
Ok, I found my 1st laptop.
dont bother looking frame work up rn. the web crashed.
Interesting gskill case, but why are tiny cases always so much money?
11:06 finally addressed the point I was originally thinking about. I mean, I can upgrade my laptop with memory and storage already, and the whole IO thing isn't that big of a deal, considering I just have to carry around a USB C dongle instead of all those little things, and if I lose my USB C dongle, it's like $20, whereas who knows how available those proprietary things are gonna be.  Let's be honest, this is one of those niche things that only a handful of people care about, which is the main reason computer manufacturers don't make them. On a desktop is takes sense, but not really in a laptop.
headphone jack gang!!
5:43 the expansion card has NOM certification which means it's probably gonna be sold in Mexico. Damn this thing's pretty tempting!
Can it run Linux easily?
Going to order one of these if i can actually get on the website...
I’m pretty sure you all broke their site  Edit: Anthony needs to do a Linux review on this puppy
I've always wondered, how come no one comes to the market and just beats everyone with reparable, modular laptop or any other tech item, if people are so into right to repair. Well, here's our chance - this could become the gold standard for laptops...
You can update your computer until the company goes belly up
I'm buying one as soon as I get my PC. Then I can get best of both worlds.
A t-series processors could have been put in a laptop as their a 35w chip and faster and easy swap.
my laptop is slowly dying, keyboard keys have popped out, the battery swelled, even the screen popped out after a bad fall from the bed. If only they would ship to EU!
Yeah this is now my favorite laptop now.
Lol we crashed their site
considering their website is now hard bricked (fuck you lot for being faster i actually wanted one) i think this idea might begin to, shall we say, upgrade the user's experience? reconfigure the status quo? modulate the market? ok i'll stop now
if and when my laptop dies ill be getting one
Can't order one because the website is under too much load lol. Nice job LTT! Everyone is excited about this!
I sure hope this is the future of all laptops. We mustn't let this thing flop!
Props to the editor for always making me laugh.
please, Please, PLEASE dont suck, Framework!
11:53 GOLD
Youtube/Google: Stop showing me Chinese subtitles on Linus vids. I'm dutch, you should know this by now...
Wow I finally want a laptop again. Haven’t gotten one since my 2011 MacBook Pro.
having watched Linus' videos for 4 years, i can guarantee that this is in the top 10 most positive reviews he has ever given for a product.
This makes me want to buy a new laptop and I don't even need one!
so a laptop but the dongle is built in?
I can't even get on Frameworks website right now.
My like is entirely designated to the Framework joke, got me good
ok now how do we convince next door's boomer to buy one?
Their website is slammed right now, wonder why 😂 I’ll check later.
That genuinely looks amazing
OMG THIS THING IS SOO COOL. Ordering it and will use it as my work laptop. this is amazing.
Their site is having issues, presumably 'cause of the video
alex should review this as though it was a normal laptop with a disclaimer at the beginning. i'm curious what he thinks about it for daily use.
This is like Project Ara and Fairphone but for a laptop.
So the cons are that the fit and finish isn't the best, what else can I say.
The moment it has risc-v and touch screen, I'm buying it. Will literally sell every computer I own, including my gaming desktop with a 3070 and 3700x in it, just to buy this laptop. Heck when their site is working I'm planning to send my resume and praying they have some need of a web developer because I would LOVE to work for them;
To upgrade my laptop i need to buy a upgradable laptop to upgrade it once again..🤐
I hope this succeeds. Their business model is noble. Hope they stay true to their vision and will profit in return.
Would love to hear Louis's thoughts on this!
Lovely jesus the camera isnt just respectable it looks fucking better than any laptop ive seen.
what if they do a partnership with camera's or mic or screens or simply sway the motherboard cpu gpu combo with a ryzen one and keep the rest as is possibilities are endless i love it
Even a human is not repairable or modular till this extent give them their whole life to change and adapt.
Dude that webcam was really good
rip the website lol
But how do I put a mechanical keyboard in there?
You broke their website, Linus. They're going to need to scale up a bit when you drop videos like this.
I feel bad I know this will fail because it is painfully marketed towards enthusiasts. I really hope they sell well and the mainstream truly appreciates it.
are they going to make 17" upgradeable game laptop? i will buy one...
hay i use a wired mouse cause if i get mad in a game i can toss it and pull it back without it getting loss in my room
There are so many rechargeable lights with magnetic charging that someone should send Linus one to educate him.
I think we broke their website I keep getting a 500 error...
Aww, they haven't opened for ordering in Norway yet, but as soon as they do, this will 100% be my next laptop :D
Dear AMD, Please partner with these guys and make GPU's for these.
Website of manufacturer down. Lots of expectations created. I want one!
that laptop would be helpful to anyone wants to learn about laptop components  since it has names,  QR codes to learn how to upgrade it on almost every part of it
But can it game? Does it have integrated graphics or a discrete GPU? Does it have a module for a GPU or do you have to do external over type C. I'm assuming it has thunderbolt since it's Intel. Any love for team red in the future? These are things I need to know.
This video crashed their website, lol.
RIP Framework website, LTT Hug of death
Porqué está en una cocina falsa? Porqué han hecho una cocina falsa en el estudio? xd
Growing up my mother had a lot of old used laptops and they always didn’t last. Younger me would of loved this product.
I like that, one of the more important reasons when I choose a laptop is if it's service friendly.  There's so many laptops that basicly requires a complete disassembly just to clean the fan.
i hope this company sticks around, so they will offer new motherboards in the future, this is some really great stuff.
Lmao the website is now down
And page of configuration of the laptop break :) So you can customize your laptop but not too much :)
Thank you Framework my you put a massive ding in the market!
If I was getting a laptop, this would be Hella cool to have
No thunderbolt is rough. Hope they can amend that.
Ah damn they are only taking orders for North America now!  Give us the possibility of giving you money Framework!
A Louis Rossmann approved repairable laptop is phenomenal
This is FANTASTIC! What a great product. I love it. If I can get this in the UK, I was wanting a new laptop ready for Windows 11. PERFECT timing.
Is there a Matte screen option?
Is that the best laptop webcam I've ever seen?  I think it is.
This is the kind of tech that should be the standard. This is what keeps ewaste down.
14:24 **cough**cough*Linux*cough**
Imagine if they make one for a gaming laptop :o
The thing project Ara could only dream of
Linus went through puberty in this video, lol!
Time to say good bye to my Dell laptop, someone is gonna replacing it soon. Wohooo
There are so many the website keeps crashing, im just trying out to configurations to see if i like anything, totally crashed
So in the future you could go on the http://frame.work website, choose any part you want, SSD, External plugs, RAM, Display, Keyboard etc and just buy it and assemble it at your home like a normal desktop PC? If the CPU should die at some point, you could just buy the mainboard for like 300 bucks and keep everything else?  1. Extremely environment friendly 2. Very customizable 3. Saves money (build it yourself) 4. Very easy to repair 5. For non tech people well documented laptop  I don't need a laptop but I will probably buy this to just support this idea.
Ahem ahem Dell🤣🤣🤣
I don't need one but I need one.
This is my next laptop. I don't care about what others say.
Bring MXM gpus and socketable cpus back!
I really wish I had money or need to upgrade my laptop right now. From this still somewhat limited amount of information i gathered here, these kind of companies deserve some support.
This is like the fairphone but for laptops
What GPU modules do they sell?
It's not often I get THIS excited about tech, but I totally think I'm gonna have to buy one of these. Gotta start saving up.
Man, if I was on the market for a laptop right now, I would straight up go for this. I really really hope this succeeds and doesn't die down.
This seems to be awesome
This is so friggin awesome!!
I don't even want a laptop yet want to support this company.
i think you ddosed their website
this is great to see, i hope other companies take note.
Linus broke the site
But will it run linux?
Imagine they sell different screens with a selection of features and resolution individually or they sell a selection of motherboards with more options on performance. you could get the base model and upgrade the same laptop for as long as they sell new parts.
I need this. U fortunately i live in europe. So according to the website I cant get it right now.
Hey is there a graphics card in this laptop? I didn't catch it if you mentioned it. Also if there isn't be can one be added?
**Happy Rossmann noises**
This is what old thinkpads did!
I hope this product & this company lives up to what they're trying to do and is able to produce many more amazing, like minded products.   Preferably with a trackpoint 😈
Bring me a 15" one, and I am sold immediately
Hoc placet mihi ut ......!
I hope this works out and they continue to make these and continue to support it. If so I will DEFINITELY get one  Update: It's been 1 week and I went ahead and bought one. Can't wait for it to arrive. This is the first laptop I've ever purchased and the first laptop I will use since 2014. VERY COOL!
It's not often I am truely impressed with a product but this seems like an awesome step forward for the tech world.  I hope in the future they make it so you can just buy new motherboards and slot them in there when the CPU needs an upgrade a few years down the line. Possibly a gaming variant too with a GPU that is swappable.  Unfortunately I don't really have a need for a laptop myself but I know where I'll be going if that changes in the future!
2:19 “ooo it even comes with a screwdriver!” Haha yes!
at first I liked that devices were coming with screw drivers. but after like 3, I realized how wasteful it is. I don't need all these tiny crappy screwdrivers, I already bought an ifixit kit! Maybe they could have a checkbox that says "include a screw driver?" ... they could even make it checked on by default. I'd just like the option to say "no I don't need it"  ... Also, I haven't had a laptop for ... 10 years? But this might be an option for me.
He bought the segway to their sponsor? What lol
thank you for reviewing the Framework laptop!
Can somebody introduce framework to system 76? That would be gold.
0:14 Sauce plz?  Also, that'd be ridiculously thicc for an upgradeable ARM based desktop replacement with a full powered desktop grade GPU!
Give me a 2 in 1 variant with touch support and this is absolutely my next laptop.
Just a absolutely insane good product!
This is literally the perfect laptop, and it's only the first iteration. This kind of modularity should be standard. Now do phones.
Pre-ordering a Framework DIY TODAY! Thank you, Linus! Fascinating review. Two words are buzzing around in my geeky brain right now: At Laaaaaassst!!! 😮
I'm buying this right now. 🤑🤑
This is exactly what I've wanted from a laptop FOREVER
weirdly enough the Laptop webcam seems to be better than the Elgato webcam and I'm really conflicted about that...
11:57 thanks wont be able to sleep for another week
I have a physicla webcam shutter, it's electric tape, I also have a physical microphone disconnect, it's a plug in the microphone jack that physically disconnects the wires to the internal microphone since it belives you have another mic connected... It has been there since I got the laptop 10 years ago. I plug in a separate webcam with a good mic if I do videocalls/meetings
Even a hardcore pc builder will love to build something like this- Einstein or me idk
Huh.  I am actually interested in a windows laptop. That hasn't happened in a long while.
Imagine this + a GPU that u can switch urself. Damn that would be awesome af.
Big companies want to make as much money with a product. Either by spending as little to make it or and making repairs impossible and very expensive. Big companies forgot how to treat customers with dignity and instead they see them as big wallets.
they got strong framework lol😁😁😁
Imagine if they make a module dock for standard desktop PC GPUs. They would literally steal the entire gaming laptop market
If I can get my mom a laptop that I can fix easily or upgrade trouble spots as it gets older I'm sold.
Where's my Type A port Dell? Damn
I'm actually in love with this approach they have
I looked into the website. This baby can upgrade motherboard!!
I'm recommending this to all my non-technical savvy friends and family so I can literally tell them to buy this and that and slot it in to do what they need and if it needs something more complicated, they can just stop over and I can fix it or install more ram or something.
I'm gonna buy one
*again
💎
Hah... um... their site seems to be kinda flooded right now... it's like they were on to something people might actually want...
Lmao price increased by $250. Not even mad. Hats off to a legitimate disruption.
I want that thing really bad!
Lol we crashed their website I think 😅
Get some AMD APU options and I'm sold!
mending rakit laptop  Framework: hold my beer
I bought an HP envy using a ryzen processor a couple years ago, and it cooks the cpu from some bios bug when you put it in to sleep mode(outer case gets up to 90C till the battery runs flat) and the power button recently stoped working. Luckily my soldering skills are good and I can replace it, but what’s the point of having a laptop that you can’t just close and carry? HP is selling half baked products that they refuse to support im ready for a new player in the world of laptops and hopefully eventually smartphones as well.
This is dope!
I am buying this now 😍
Waiting for Dave2D to cover this amazing laptop!!
dope1
This thing looks awesome!
My Asus laptops CPU fried because of shoddy thermal paste appliance, 2 weeks after warrantee so they wouldn't replace anything and couldn't even send me a new motherboard (even if I would pay for it). Haven't been interested in buying a laptop since, untill I saw this beauty!
I have would have bought if there was a descrete gpu option even if it was heavier and thicker. Hopefully in future
Brandon's laugh always cracks me up
The site is down
dude the site just went down
I only heard about these guys recently, but damn that laptop sure was impressive.
A fraction of a cent?!? That's just too much money for a company like Apple to spend on its customers.   The audacity of Linus to think a $2T company could afford that much money!  (For those of you unable to tell what sarcasm looks like in text, this is sarcasm.)
Dang! When Linus himself is ordering your product, you know it's that cool + great advertisement too Keep up the good work, Framework team!!!
Watching Linus waving the laptop about one handed is giving me way too much anxiety for 2021...
I ain't buying this laptop until it is gpu upgradable.
The Homepage is down since this video is up, lol
11:55 LMAO
God damn this made me say "woah," it blows my mind when companies throw in little extra things or pander to the consumer a little extra and I think this is the start of a huge new movement in right to repair and companies running their companies in more consumer positive ways
so it's Upgradeability is basically some pcie/usb-c cards that do the same job as m2 cards you can swap in ANY other notebook xD What a BS. It is all as replaceable as any other dell or thinkpad. Bring back Upgradable CPU and then we can talk. There is nothing absolutely nothing special about this device other than BS marketing.
Remember when pretty much every laptop was configurable? Framework remembers.
I think this is the first time I've been genuinely excited by new hardware in a loong time
Incredible. Absolutely incredible
Gotta love the real emotions at 14:14.
NOW, what have they done about putting the execute signal on the 'newline or carriage return - on typewriters- and separating it to a an enter key off to one side!!! also get the damn apostrophe key away from the damn enter key, PLEASE TRAINED TYPISTS ARE FREAKING BEGGING YOU! IS NOT A TYPEWRITER, STOP PRETENDING TO FAKE A TYPEWRITER KEYBOARD!!!
I recommend that you guys watch the video Adam Savage's Tested did on this. They interviewed the CEO, he is a great guy and gives some insight about how they went about developing everything.
Amazing
Honest question/ Critique.  In a pretend world where every major laptop make did have a modular laptop series. Would that not create more E-Waste?
Ordering one, putting my money where my mouth is. This thing is sick, the prospect of being able to upgrade the motherboard down the road, and use the internal one as an SBC in my homelab k3s cluster is so cool
Adult lego at its ultimate form lol
Make a tablet-shaped shell with ports for Switch controllers on the sides.
That is it. Thank you me. For not Compromising, and buying some shit. I am buying it ASAP.
basically im saying that my girlfriend is a terrible person
Can we use amd processor in this laptop?
I have no need for one and I want one!
Well shit. I wasn't going to buy one because I wasn't sure the company would last, but with publicity like this maybe I should reconsider.
I've been wondering why laptops like this haven't been main stream for well over ten years. Obviously we have the technology.
This vid really screams nondisclosed partnership for some reason
... I want one... I don't even need a laptop right now, but I want one.
but can you buy my sponser?
It's like F2P games, but the games give you option to buy skin and other item via microtransaction. But, I love it.
Soddered? You mean Solder right?
this is what i have been shouting for years, im am a maker and when companies say "sorry but we had no other choice because inovation" all i see are ways to fix their "Problem" like gluing in the battery in phones *cough* samsung "cough". Pull tabs or screw are great. Then we have the glue that holds the phones together. All companies had to to was make a glue soulvent to brake apart the glue for example
Finally. I found out about the Framework Laptop a while ago and it's awesome. All I'd need is a version that ships with Linux and has a graphics card, but right now it's already perfect for most people (you can order them pre-assembled).
I love an upgradable laptop. But I'm fine with non replaceable ports. It would take less space so they could fit more than 4 ports. I'd like more powerful CPU especially rysen and rtx GPU for gaming
1:57 Does anyone knows why Linus has a cracked phone?
This company's after my own heart
I've never been so excited about a laptop before! Buying as soon as the website comes back up.
Remember Google's Project Ara?
Congrats We Crashed The Website 😺
This is the type of work I can get behind. Hope it will be available in Europe soon.
Me at first: "wow thats really cool" Linus: "It can use up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM" Me: "......SHUT UP AND TAKE ME MONEY!!"
Yup, you guys just killed their website.
Over all I do think they have a point, BUT: It also is a bit thicker than really tight integrated Ultrabooks (like a MacBook) and probably also a bit heavier (considering it is a bit thicker). But I do agree, that many Laptops could easily be just like this one and not loose their formfactor. It is just that I don't agree with the statement that it is JUST LIKE AN ULTRABOOK
Dat jab at Dell, that gave me a chuckle and I use their products.
3:44 Gujaratis are everywhere !!😁😀
When they get AMD with some GPU options, I will certainly be taking a looks.
My 15" Tongfang notebook, weighing 1.55Kg and 16mm thick, has a replaceable battery of 91Wh, which is close to the max you can take on a plane...
i think we crashed the site. this vids been up for 15 mins
Framework website crashed after this video was uploaded
It's a really nice concept but what about pricing? Would it continue to stay affordable or would it mark up prices, similar to One Plus?
I want to see jerryrigeverything open this up
I remember way back in the day there was some guy who had this concept in mind for a smartphone.  Fully modular, fully repairable, you can change every component out of the phone like legos. It looked absurd at the time and heavily unrealistic but looks like its only a matter of time before it becomes feasible.
the fact that their website crashed because of your in depth review shows how big the market actually is for right to repair people.
This is the exact kind of laptop I need. My K55A is 8 years old and might have to retire in a few years. I was losing hope of getting something close to it as almost all manufacturers have stopped offering non-gaming laptops with 2 RAM slots. Really happy now that I can get something even better. Edit: So far it seems they only have a 13.5" model. I really hope they will make a 15" model eventually.
This is the early 2000 auto industry. Make shitty cars you can’t fix so they just buy Another shitty car. Until couple manufacturers don’t do business that way. Then the shitty car manufacturers start crying why people don’t do business with them anymore.
it would be helpful if i had one but the site is realy buggy and they dont ship to my countrie
he almost pulled a Linus at the start of the video..
If my school didn't give me a free laptop I would definitely buy it.
I just hope Framework doesn't become super profit-focused as they start to gain traction as that's when the initial philosophies start to change
Dare we talk about the graphics performance?
You lucky Americans, we in Europa have to wait for the end of 2021 to get one of these devices!
I can't "unsee" Linus saying Q-pon after ROG RIG Reboot with MDog.
LoL I've been looking at this for soo long tho it's a little expensive for repairability/upgradeability
So glad you finally got around to talking about this. Looks like it really delivers.
Is there a GPU upgradable slot? If not will there be one in the future for say a power laptop edition? Great job as always you guys.
I think your video crashed their website from traffic…
I wish nothing but success for this company, this is such a cool device!
If they make a gaming laptop version of this I'm definitely. Hell, I'm tempted to buy even without a GPU until I remember video render times without CUDA. Edit: Holy shit that battery disconnect feature is the most important thing on a laptop I've ever seen! Fucking great work!
I wasn't even in the market for a laptop and I want one. lol
Site crash!
Did we kill the site?? Was in the middle of checking one out when *BOOM*
:0
Shut up and get my money
Videos such as these will help you pay for your 360K wall TV.
Trying to order one, website is sllooooww!
LMAO, I think the Linus video caused a flood of visitors to their site.
Well shouldn't touch be a upgrade option soon then aye?
How notebooks should be
Frameworks website just crashed lol
I like to see Framework expand thier modular design of a laptop to the likes of what the early days of Alienware used to be, better battery life, with replaceable/upgradable CPU & GPU, that also give room for better cooling, reducing CPU throttle.
looks like the traffic killed their website  500 Internal Server Error If you are the administrator of this website, then please read this web application's log file and/or the web server's log file to find out what went wrong. {"mode":"full","isActive":false}
Can it run crysis ?
I just wanted to see how much they were and..... now the website is down. Linus crashing webservers one product announcement at a time.
now, can we please have this, but with a high end CPU and dGPU? also in 17 inches
No touch option is a bummer
And Framework's Site is Dead LaMAO
Wait is he wearing oura smart ring on his left hand ? Would love a review.
The site crashed!!!

This is genuinely one of the most exciting hardware developments in recent years.
nope and nope on that kind of computer. If that is the future screw computers
I really love the modular IO. Looks really clean and I'd probably have issues not popping them in and out a lot.
You have crashed frame.work
This would be fantastic for schools and businesses. You could have a bin with extra modules at your work when you wanna switch things up a little. You could pass around the external storage module when working in teams or when you need to hand in the laptop for repair and get a replacement.
Put peanut butter on it.
Go look at the website, and there's an error. Did LMG kill frameworks website? Lol
Man, if they start to support RTX, im going to really consider buying this.
I really hopes Framework is successful because I need a daily driver for work that is light, affordable and is somewhat powerful and I don't like the fact that if I broke something or an accident happened then I can't repair it.
1000$ not bad,just like my stupid phone...i`m sold i`m getting one when the website is up again...
I like it but honestly it's not price-competitive in any way with normal laptops. In fact if not for the unique "upgradeability" aspect I would just call it a straight up rip-off. That being said, I do think it offers a unique value and might be cool if you have the budget. I just don't understand how Linus made it out as being so cost-effective.
Tears of Joy linus tears of joy. Can I support them ??
Wish I had money I would get one seems like a interesting laptop
Insane Laptop.
I love their laptop so much, I just need a 360 hinge and touch screen with windows ink so that I can use it for digital notes. And they could easily add this with a new body and screen down the road. Fingers crossed.
website is dead haha
Linus' excitement is contagious here. Super exciting, and definitely considering for the next time I need to buy a laptop.
If Linus excitement was named after any product it would be Linus Excitement Plus
You've killed their website, LMG.  Kudos.  :P
Waiting patiently for the lttstore.com keyboard module
Ok…fine… i want one….
I know what I'm getting. The quick swap io is just too good to pass.
o7 good job LTT fans, the framework site is down.... o7
I've been interested in this since seeing it on Louis' channel. I even saved up quite a bit of money in order to preorder but unfortunately they do not allow "international" orders from Puerto Rico. This is one of those cases where I'm literally begging them to take my money but they don't want to because... reasons. Puerto Rico uses the same damn mail providers as the mainland US! (USPS, FedEx, UPS, DHL, etc) There aren't even any import fees as long as the package is being sent from one of the States! Come on, Framework!
This video just made the framework website go down because of trafic lol
This makes me sad about how hard it is to get into my mother's macbook pro. Can't do shit in that
Isn’t area 51m a upgradable laptop?
it's fucking 3:2 screen aswell! oh god, i hope they release a bigger one, like a v2 with a graphics card
I hope that this company makes billions and succeed with this idea.
I have a magsafe type usb c adapter thats PD compatible and has great transfer rates I got off amazon for like 25 dollars...
Holy crap please make an update video after you've used it for a month!!!
Yeah I'm getting one if only to encourage the little guy shake things up
VERY cool. I would LOOOOOOOOVVE to see this company get big.
You know your review is good when it shuts down manufacturers website lmao
Damn, if I hadn't just bought a Dell xps 15, this would definitely be a consideration.
you can still check the website using the wayback machine just a handy tip
my main question is who is the laptop primarily designed for? gamers? is it more of a work/learning laptop? very cool design and i would love to see what these guys could do with a gaming specific laptop (i mainly wanna see if they come up with a way to make module graphic cards)
so bluetooth headphones yeay! went for them missing the fact theyre instore only and im in the uk :-(
I don't even need a Laptop,nor want one, like at all, but I'm already sold on that one and seriously considering getting it to support it!
Save this company , or soon this company will be gone
This looks like Moto mods for their phone except this is for laptops and it is fully upgradable,then this might be a very good laptop.
"How amazing is that" "How cool is that" "How easy is that"  oh no this is reminding me of someone hahahaha
Literally cannot open their website right now. This is going to be a killer product
1:39 omg this trick froze my blood for a second there
please for the love of god, make this a mainstream machine
I don't have the money, but I would love one of these. It really sounds amazing T....T I hope they really do okay, sounds like a game changer!
The Phonebloks of laptops.
YOU SEE THAT? DO YOU SEE THAT?  FUTURE, SON. NOTHING LOOKS LIKE QUITE LIKE THAT   I LOVE THE LOOK OF FUTURE IN THE MORNING
If we properly fund this company by buying their products, they will turn the whole laptop industry around. More companies will see that this is profitable and will come out with their own upgradable laptops. Let's change the world Gamers! Edit: We ran them out of stock and crashed their website. NICE
Damn that webcams is great
Clear keyboard causes dinosaur noises. Life uh... Finds a way. Also, the website has been hugged to death.
Just watched it, and searched for their website, saw it on Google, clicked, and there’s an error. You may have inadvertently sent too much traffic to their site. I will just have to check them out later. Edit: Working now (barely).
I’m excited to see what v.2 of their motherboards (with dgpus??) and displays are.
Imagine this laptop with a custom mini itx motherboard. Imagine one of those APUs from Intel or AMD in that laptop
imagine one of those being a gpu lmao
Thank you for reviewing this laptop, I just read up on them last night. I am going to place my order today from this company.
Perfect! Now I want an acceptable iOS and iPadOS competitor. Android and Windows are just the worst. God I hate what Google and Microsoft are doing.
This is why I love LTT, they actually care about what's good for the consumer!
How to DDoS a server: 1-> be Linus 2-> Make a video about how good a product Is 3-> Profit
This is awesome i cant wait to get one
This is awesome. I'm even thinking I need swappable modules in my desktop PC instead of PCI for some stuff.
Wow. I’m kinda blown away by this. 👏 👏 👏  Literally everything looks like it was designed with care and consideration for the consumer. I’m not in the market for a laptop right now. But if I ever need one I’m putting this company on the top of the list.
INVEST!
For once a pro consumer laptop, I really hope this drags other laptop makers HARD for being so proprietary and closed off to self repair.
I think your video killed their website....getting a 500 Internal Server error at the moment....  That is incredible looking to be that user friendly.
How have they not come up with a non soldered mobile CPU yet.
Only US english keyboards available so far, otherwise I would have ordered one already.
Also the dell is metal so it's unfair
Guys please do more videos about this company whenever they release something new so I don't forget about them, because I'm definitely buying one whenever my current laptop doesn't hold up anymore if I remember them
It's my birthday
Just tried getting on the site, I dont think it can handle the traffic this video just generated. I'm sure the creators are pleasantly surprised! :D
This laptop is future! Cant wait when mobile high end GPUs and CPUs become upgradable, along with motherboards!
This is awesome. I truly hope they stick around.
I recently had the problem that replacing my laptop screen was more expensive than buying a new laptop, so that's cool
That’s really cool! I would definitely consider buying a laptop like this 😄
This will be my next notebook. Not because of the upgrade options. The fact that I can choose my ports how I need them makes the notebook to m next device.
Since you'll have to come back to framework for upgrades doesn't that make it at form of proprietary ?
We really need standards like this across the industry. I would love that for laptop GPUs as well. Break it down by TDP
This is amazing. I will buy the next model if Framework keeps up the good work
no video games?
This is the reason Steve Woz left Apple, he wanted his company to do THIS!
This whole company is probably a big "Screw You" to other companies.
I really hope they succeed as a company
I think you may have broken their website... Lol. Will seriously consider this once and if they are available in south africa.
This is what our laptops of the future need to look like! The transparency and modularity are so great to see, this very likely may be my next laptop :)
Wanted to check the site out but it's been hugged to death lmao
cool
I'd love to see long term coverage of this company! Especially when they release display and motherboard upgrades!   I'm also curious how they're going to handle major tech jumps. Like what happens when USB 4 modules come out and the motherboard doesn't support it. Is this handled through some kind of generation system or just a ton of warnings when you purchase the module?
I need
Does it have Intel Management Engine??
Honest question. Have linus broke a piece of tech before having a chance to do a video for it.. or during video (with no replacement) ???
everyone in the industry: "NO the consumer cant be trusted"  Framework: "haha upgrades go brrrrrr"
We need a follow up video in a year or 2
Framework’s website can’t handle the traffic coming from this video. It’s beautiful.
Louis Rossman approved
Oh boy I think their website is down.
Just a headsup y'all, this thing doesn't support discrete GPUs - you'll have to get an external enclosure for that. Every other spec looks amazing, though!
Gotta love seeing a tech company do stuff like this, if I was in the market for a laptop they would surely get my business!
Isn't showing the order number bad? 17:50
Now this was made by ACTUAL Engineers. You know exactly what I mean. I will 100% be a customer in the near future.
I love this.  Can't buy one right now but hopefully soon!
Just wanted to show my support, so more people will find this video ❤
Wow, I never owned a laptop since I dont need one most of the time, but dang, this is awesome. The more people buy this thing the more other manufacturers will look at repairability as a feature instead of a waste of time and money on developing a product.
I can hear Louis Rossmann approving from here.
Headphone Jack Not Modular? NICE
Maybe a desktop CPU would be a possibility, undervolted? And for the GPU that (almost) dead standard Alienware also used once?  I'd gladly invest in this ecosystem btw. This is amazing. It's actually pretty unbelievable how well polished this is.
This happens when people authentically know what they are doing.
The sites down due to respected Linus drop tips
LTT staff has a heart attack every time Linus picks up a device
... i really like my track point though.
Lets go frame.work! Super exciting approach to manufacturing.
This is genuinely one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. I’m asking for one as a graduation present, rather than money for an RTX. I can’t remember the last time I was this jazzed for any piece of tech, let alone a freaking laptop.
I really want one. There's things this machine has that I miss.
:D
THIS IS THE COOLEST LAPTOP I'VE EVER SEEN!
Now i want a ryzen version
It reminds me of the concept of Block Phone.
this is not yet the full power of right to repair
"The dell's not even bleeping thinner" not often LTT provokes the kind of laugh I let out at that.
I'm super rooting for this company to succeed.  They did basically everything right.  The only big question is their longevity.  If they sell enough to create a stable foundation, small businesses that need to squeeze every ounce of value out of their laptops and need them to be sure that repairs will be affordable and available should look to companies like this first.  If you have a laptop fleet of all the same model then as they age and the chassis start to fall apart, you can salvage them for spare parts for those still running. As a consumer my wish list for the future of framework is: - touchscreen option - another version with dgpu (maybe a 15") - Surface-style tablet PC with pen support Linus mentioned magnetic connectors.  I'd also kill for a magnetic thunderbolt compatible connector standard.  I recently decided to try out magnetic usb cables and while there is no standard for these, I just bought a bunch that I use in my own home/office/car and they've been fantastic, but they only do usb-2.0 data rates (the ones I got are Volta brand).  I still use my Surface Pro 3 and the connector is great for that.  As much as USB-C standardization is great in some ways, I wish that there were a standard for a magnetic connector as well.
Finally laptop that is not anti-repair, anti-consumer and environmentally unfriendly. Just like Linus; I'm sold.
The one thing I want ALL laptops to be able to do is BOOT and OPERATE with the lid closed and the LCD disabled. Why? Because I use it as a very slim desktop most of the time and it'll be nice to not have to have it take up desk space and distract me with its display when I am home and plugged into two 4K monitors, an external KB and external mouse.
I really like the concept, but you can't deny it's worrying not to know if it will work well enough to still see new components sold by them in 2-3 years. For the moment, I would only buy it for what is available right now. If they are still around and strong by that time, good, but if not, I wouldn't be disappointed.
This is the future.
Why does the backround music sounds like my phone beginning to ring constantly
Lovee the Idea behind this lappy. + It's practical . unlike that android project
a DIY build laptop. even if the processor is soddered, you could easily just buy new motherboard inserts to keep it upgraded over the years, could even swap between amd and intel, or new socket/process nodes. But i really see this as being MORE profitable for them than the locked units the other people sell. Instead of having 8000 different skus or losing customers for not offering what people want, they can just make new modules to catch everyone.  you want 4k monitor? 1080p 320hz? new switches on the keyboard? bigger battery? better webcam?  They can just release a new base shell every once in a while as needed, and stick with the components and it would be awesome.
Hope they will be available in my country soon 😍
Correct me if I'm wrong but you can actually buy upgradable motherboards.  So you save money on ram ssd battery display wifi etc
Y'all broke the framework website good job
I think this video broke their website. I cann't get on it.
Preordered. This is cool as shit. I've always wanted something like this. In the late 00's I'd only purchase upgradable laptops.
love it.
This is actually insanely cool. I wish more laptops at least allowed you to easily disconnect the battery, maybe something like a switch you can flick on the outside to route power directly into the system without going through battery first.
I mean, I'm sorry to say that but this laptop will actually be less repairable in two years than most flagships. No way this company will live long enough to supply parts and not many people buying these means there will be no parts on used market.
Lmao their website is under maintenance 🤣🤣
In fairness to clips, there are some environments in which magnets are risky to have on electronics.  I started using Volta-style cables in a machine shop, and the accumulation of rusty metal dust in the connectors kills them pretty fast despite frequent attempts to clean.  The magnet thing is really cool, but there is a downside.
Man, my display sucks! Frameworks, I want a 4k display. Man, my graphics card is not powerful enough! Frameworks, I want a new mobo. And like this you spent $2000 on your laptop upgrading it instead buying one every 5 years.  But you have the option of what and when you want to upgrade.
Man, that's like the Dell Precision M6800 I just bought. It has extra screws for HDD/SSD because you might lose the ones that originally came with it. Most of the slots are labels as to what goes in then and everything is really easy to get to.
I use a magnetic charger on all my laptops. How you ask? I use Volta chargers via USB-C ;-). It's basically the best way to make any laptop use magnetic charging. Also works on your phones, headsets, smart watches, and anything that uses USB C, lightning, or Micro USB.
What GSkill* bought is this segue to our sponsor
Framework just made its framework.
Finally a pc that's thin and upgradeble but not a gaming laptop!!!!
…and we’ve officially crushed the life out of their website, with a generous “Love Hug” as some would call it.  I don’t think anyone is ever prepared for the influx of traffic from being featured in an LTT video for the first time.
A company that's probably suffering from success now I see.
Honestly, if framework were to add different skins that you could apply yourself, and not just stick them on to the outside of the case, and actually replace the shell of the laptop, that would be insane.
Linus: I bought one Me: The wall?
Louis Rossman needs to see this
Epic
Tldr, until we get all standard parts in laptops like we do in desktops products like these do nothing.  First off, i love the idea behind this and i realise they are one of the few who actually tried making a product like this. But, in the end you're still realiant on their proprietary modules for outside expansion. I realise that's better than nothing but its still incredibly limiting. The dream would be using all standard parts, which is very much possible but it is very hard to integrate into a pretty looking device. The replaceable mobo and their cpu roadmap sounds amazing, but in the end you again are reliant on framework supporting the product and coming through with the upgrades. As we have sodimm's for laptop ram, we need standard mobos and replacable cpu's. Until then products like this are stopgaps at best and marketing ploys for techies at worst.  At the end of the video Linus says it himself, they designed the product in a way that you have to come to them for upgrades.  If that doesn't sound like a rehashed  walled garden then i don't know what does.
I would like to see laptops get swappable CPU's and GPU's.
Maybe… just maybe… the tide is turning
You should build a pc in a microwave,
Hey Linus, I live in Seattle WA area. Can you try get word to Micro Center to open a store here. We used to have Fry's Electronics, but now, we don't have anything comparable.  Micro Center open a store here, it should do very well. Maybe even use same building Fry's was in, assuming it's still available. It's in a decent location.
Is this love?
I would love to see what they can do in the space of a "mobile desktop" style gaming laptop. I feel like the sky is the limit for them here.
Do you guys warn these companies of when you post a review to the channel ? https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&q=frame.work
We killed their website lol
I bought a second hand X220 precisly for this reason. Run with that for a year and NOW its time to look at upgrading!
Lovely
I hope Apple burns in flames and gets replaced by Framework!!!
Linus dropped his Note 9? Why am I not surprised?
Lame idea, but still... "The Rossmachine".  I wonder how Louis would react if someone brought him one of these for repair. Such a delightful laptop.
This must be a dream collab for dbrand?
their shop is in maintenance mode, rip.
I really hope this laptop changes the industry
The care and attention to this device is amazing. I hope Framework goes far. This is awesome!
This is secretly an ad for Acer laptops. I only buy Acer laptops because of these things, for my entire life
good laptop set up. it's always been not worth the effort.
Where do I buy one
Linus: starts out trying to sell this device as being just as clean and sexy as more tightly-integrated laptops  Also Linus: puts on ugly see-through keys that will immediately turn off every single "clean look" type user.
I already have their website open on my phone so whenever I need a new laptop I know where im going. If anyone is looking for something sort of like this for phones give fairphone a look.
i hope they make gamer version   swappable gpu's
I think we crashed their site
guys stop crashing the page i need to order one!
Looks like their website needs to be a little more modular, all the traffic from this video has killed it.
Best laptops webcam I've seen Hands down
About time a laptop i can recommend instead of saying... just get a desktop
@Louis Rossmann
Wait till linus see zyrex laptop and lose his mind
I can't believe we crashed the site, I was ready to put my deposit down
it's been next to impossible to find a decently priced laptop with the arrangement of I/O not to mention reliability for the last couple of years. With so many laptop manufacturers screwing over the end users countless times and in different ways. If you don't pay enormous amounts of money for what you want, you can't get it, but in doing so they then stuff a bunch of other shit in the laptops that only contribute to it's far earlier demise or add additional costs for things we don't even need.  The most common irritation is the fact that so many will segment their laptops in such a way, that getting what you need ends up with a dedicated gpu being thrown into the mix that you don't need at all.  I'm a retailer, and i get constant customers that are frankly fed up with what is available, many aren't clearly aware of what they actually need either, but if there is one thing that is a certainty, it's that adding a dedicated gpu to a system, is that it's going to be the primary likely problem in the future, be it through all out failure, or the fact that even if it's not "running"... it's still eating power unnecessarily. Much like literally anything else on the planet, the more shit you jam into a tight space as a "feature".. the more things can go wrong and will go wrong that had it not been there at all, likely would result in a far greater lifespan and functionality in the future, plus it just costs less.  If framework can provide some Ryzen 5000 series APUs without any additional dedicated gpus, keep temps low, keep good modularity, i'm sure i could sell dozens if not hundreds of these laptops to customers waiting.   OH, and one other thing, USB type A ports and most certainly C, if there is one thing that utterly kicks ass for this modularity, is that the shear number of people that have destroyed their usb ports, being forced to replace the entire laptop, simply pulling the modular part out and sliding in a new one is game changing. If it isn't dead dedicated gpus killing laptops prematurely, it's the charge ports/usb ports that have made them useless as well.
Dream come true.
Their site is down. LMAO Shows how many people WANT this.
0:08 my hands couldn't fix it because I have tremors in my hands you dick. Reported for mocking my medical issue.
AND HOW LONG WILL THIS PRODUCT BE SUPPORTED WITH NEW PARTS?
Dang, I might just order one of these
All you need is to add hybrid mini led eink hybrid screen and proper thermal output instead of the keyboard and you have very functional AIO mobile PC  you can bring everywhere you want.
Take my money.
And as simply as this, the main argument laptop manufacturers use against serviceability falls down on its own weight. It can look good, be thin and have nice features while being serviceable.  Good job Framework. They even got Louis Rossmann's approval XD
website down xd
WEIRDCHAMP
It almost looks like you could stamp it with "made by users for users".
What I'm going to say is might end up r/agedlikemilk but I strongly think framework will growup through enthusiasts and then become like any other OEM manufacturer like oneplus.
He looks like such a happy chappy all the way through this vid
I think we crashed their site, it won't load for me
The website has crashed due to traffic
This looks amazing! Louis Rossman would love this!
Site crashed.  Thanks a lot Linus.
So this is my next laptop. Who's with me?
great! You all crashed the site. And I'm freakin excited about it. F Apple.
Wow, a lot of thought went into this design. every little details is tought out. fantastic idea product! I hope this laptops will sale really good so we can see more upgrades and models in de future!
This is deadass halo reach customization but for a laptop.i do hope one day they make swappable gpus, that is the day i will buy one.
Checked their website and it is soooooo slow :) no doubt this video made all of viewers jump right there! Too bad i cant get one, no ordering where I am atm.
i wanna change my vivobook for one of these real bad rn...
Just wow. I will have to buy one as soon as they open international shipping
hmm see I wish you get completely upgrade-able humans...
LTT, make sure to keep us all updated periodically and keep that love coming. So great to see such enthusiasm for a cool niche project
Everytime Lunis brings out his Galaxy note Im crying inside. I can't stand my personal phone being in that state everytime I use it.
we have to make a framework magsafe adapter that works with old apple chargers
I though iFixit said you can change the motherboard once they come up with a new one 🤔🤔
"affordable" as in the $1500 version with an 1185g7 and absolutely nothing else costs the same as a full strix g15 advantage with a 6800m and everything, or the absolute minimum of an 1135g7 costing the same as a secondhand gaming laptop ram, storage, and mobile dgpu inclusive
Met year, new products: framework phone & tablet
11:55 wtf LOL
We broke the website.
We crashed their site
if only they had AMD cpus and not a dumb arrow key layout, i would 100% buy one. currently looking for a laptop and this fits all the criteria (as long as there is an RJ 45 port!)
I actually started seeing some ads for this a week or two ago, and thought this was a really cool concept. Now seeing Linus make a video, I might be sold on it already as my next laptop.
Apple. Its like you buy a badge without any premium. Its a product made with slave labor on a non sealed motherboard with a component cost and labor of about 300 USD and you buy it for 3000. And it breaks every 2 years unless you live in Arizona. And the warranty is non existent so every time something breaks the Genius tells you just to buy a new one for another 3000. No wonder their a Trillion $ company.
like any other laptop a soldered cpu? my old gaming laptop would like a word with its full 775 cpu socket xD
was waiting for this video for a very long time
Wow the tables have flipped! Used to be laptop manufacturers could learn from car manufacturers. Now car manufacturers need to design cars with same level of care for the end user as this laptop company! Genius product design!
i remember the google modular phone, project ara that never really worked out
This design ethos should become international law!
16:33 it was annoying and creepy AF on my ol' HP laptop
If they can make it so that gaming is done well, I would seriously consider it.
I wish one of those modules would be a gpu. Thats always the main item that makes me want to upgrade.
I want a 15 inch version of this.  I would buy it in a heartbeat assuming this company can stay afloat for the foreseeable future and keep making parts it might just be the last laptop I will need to buy for 10 years
Does this laptop by framework have an upgradable gpu?
I hope this is the future for other laptop brands
ummm. . did you cause their site to crash?
Ok but wont the qr codes fade after years of wear and tear and especially the heat from the laptop would make the print of the qr codes fade
You use a wired mouse Linus because theres no input lag like other wireless mice. :)
1:57 Yeah he builds $ 100000 PCs but still uses an 3 year old phone
So many good ideas here, love it.
Just would like to point out... You appear to have brought their website down with the traffic going to it. I keep getting random 500 errors when trying to connect.
1:58 I mean... fairphone....
servers are down xD
What's the green thing hanging out of the bottom drawer?
Oof, that moment when Linus crashes the website of the company.
Congrats, the website died
I'll wait for a gaming varient. It needs to be more thick.
FRAME WORKS - IKEA, what is going on here....
Now if there only was a ryzen(3)-option... i'd even take a U-Part, no need for H/HX/HS...
Ayeee
imagine if later down the line they do gaming laptops...i know it could be kinda impossible but just a small What If
Maybe they can even make a convertible version, thats what i am be looking for right now
Their site is getting fucking HAMMERED right now.
Desktop and notebook merge into ... a Desknote
2289th comment
No.1 on my buy list now... gotta support them.
I haven't been this excited about laptops since 2008. That modular design at a very thin form factor is just so awesome!
This type of video is the best kind of advertising a company could get.    If the company fails, it's our fault for not putting our money where our mouth is and not supporting innovation.
i remember a phone concept like this years ago, glad to see it's being implemented
Maybe it's because I've been using Thinkpads for so long, but I actually like thicker  laptops. Never really understood the hype around the whole "thin and light" design philosophy.
Now I want to return my iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, and Apple Pencil. Like sure, I won’t be able to draw, but this is amazing.
Definitely might be my next laptop. Hope when Ryzen 6000 release they sell a ryzen thunderbolt compatible laptop.
Removable ports are taking it too far imo. But the rest is amazing I want one
Someone show this to Louis
I don't know I went to their website and as I was looking at the laptops it crashed.
Nice, but i would prefer socket-able CPU and MXM graphics card to interchangeable IO modules.
I don't trust that they'll make enough profit to stay afloat
I use apple for the preferable OS and laptop experience, but dear lord, I love the physical design of this laptop, like a lot.
This should be the future of laptops.
I do not need a laptop but i want this badly.
But can it game?
Love the Idea, Just need to get Some better CPU options
Lol I wanted to pre order one but you’ve crashed their site
Hes gonna take you back to the past, when laptops still didnt suck ass.
Make this the future...
Well, framework's website has been ddos'd by people ordering it
This company is awesome! Please dont applize your company when you guys get real big
If I ever buy a laptop. It will be this.
i think this video destroyed their website cuz i cant do shit over there (it crashed if u go a bit into the customisation part)
Oooooo
hahaha the website is down right after they uploaded the video
everyone should just give them free advertisement and just put there logo over all logos of all other product :P
Can we install mac os x on it? Anthony, make it happen.
This is all laptop should be..
Ok you guys took down their website xD
The website crashed 🤣
We have crashed their site :D
This is really good I wish they succeed..and the timing of it with the right to repair movement, yeah, that's on point.
im soooo going to buy one
How to define a good product? Depends on will your website crash after reviews appeared.
i want one but there's a 500 in my way
I think you might have given the Framework site the kiss of death. Main page loads but DIY configure page does not.
This is so. freaking. cool! I really hope they get a lot of orders!
I'm sure most casual users will be scared of any disassembly even if it's as easy as this.
The mindset that the manufacturer has towards their consumers is one that states "You're too dumb to repair your machine, but you're just smart enough to spend your hard earned money with us because we let you to."
I want one. I was so sad that Project Ara didn't succeed
website got the hug of death
The only thing I hate about Linus and others is still that bullcrap about thin laptops. There's not enough room for the ventillation... the laptop is great though, would like to be some kind of a GPU part like that Panasonic Toughbook had, but it's still great.
That is the dream MacBook Pro 16....
They should call themself "pear". There's a German saying "Äpfel mit Birnen vergleichen" (compare apples to pears) to say something is very different... But I admit, they have indeed a great framework.
Let me know when they put a 3070 graphics card in there. Then I might buy one.
I love this idea.  4 ports isn't enough though.  I hope they succeed and make a bigger one with room for graphics power and lots more IO, or at least port cards with more ports, like 2 usb2 per module instead of just one usb3.  Maybe that's something that can be made by 3rd or 2nd party.
It will come to the usual problems. Durability, long term support and profitability of the business model.
this is what happens when you keep marketing, sales, and greedy investors out of the process and let the engineers have free roam. Just look at the SR-71 Blackbird they let the engineers experiment and develop on their own without interference and they built a jet that can do mach 3 twenty five years after the development of the jet engine.
I think their site just started crashing since you made the video. God this laptop is impressive!!
This has been the dream for so long.  I wouldn't care if it was fatter to allow better cooling/battery life.
8:33 Laughs in Clevo NH58AF1/Eluktronics Thicc-15. This thing is cool though, hopefully they continue with more high powered skus.
Linus orders a laptop for himself, compooter company stock skyrockets! 😄👍  I really like this approach, there's simply no reason why laptops couldn't (and shouldn't) be modular and upgradeable. The only reason is greedy corporations who want to make as much money off of people just because there are no other options for consumers!  I work as a vehicle mechanic and it's the same shit there... Things simply aren't very repairable these days, even though they so could be but all we do is replacing expensive components when it might just have been a $5 bearing that's gone kaputt. The sheer insanity of the ecological waste boggles my mind, to be honest. I often wonder how much pollution took place, making that failed component,  have it transported across the planet and then making me throw the old part in the bin... 🙄  There's gotta be a substantial change in laws around the world making it illegal to throw away something if it's cheaper, economically as well as ecologically and make companies provide parts for whatever it is instead of making us buy brand new stuff everything some little thing breaks! 🤔
Teach a man to fish and you feed him forever.
I have a laptop with a dead battery that is in sore need of being replaced. I think, in a couple of months, I am going for this thing.
Linus, you just crashed their website....
sh!t I think ill be going over and checking them out
I hope this is the future. Love it.
This is just about perfect. I'm hoping they are around and have fully ramped up manufacturing when I need a new laptop at the end of the year. Hopefully a touch screen will be available but otherwise it covers just about everything else I would want. I didn't see any weights but if it is under 3lb it would work for me. If it was an option for a smaller lighter battery (half size?) that would be great as well, I do 95% of my work plugged in and never spend more than an hour or two when unplugged.
Ex HTC engineers? This thing is going to last forever, until the comapany goes bankrupt, because no costumer needs a new device.
I can't wait until they come out with 15" w/ dedicated graphics - so sick of hardware manufacturers shackling people to un-upgradable hardware
This actually really looks promising. Can't wait to the point when the industry shifts to USB4 with PCIe tunneling so this thing can explode with different types of CPU+MOBO combos, so people could finally make their own laptop builds with this type of form factor and let their imagination create some DIY crazy stuff like custom chasis or cooling. Of course this makes it more complex as this would require a matching PSU, but hey, I don't really remember if custom laptops were any closer than this.
This video crashed the website. I can’t preorder mine lol
I ordered mine the day preorders went live, still waiting, no replies from Framework.
they just need an AMD  apu variant... i might jump into this.. very promising.
Great to see a company that actually cares about consumers.
the website be like : be gentle lines
Seeing the internals brought a tear to my eye
I think this video made their website crash
Please review the freedom phone.
Honestly when they figure out how to make gaming laptops like this I am so down. I'm only after a low end gaming laptop but the fact that they are either huge for upgradability or not upgradable at all makes it difficult for me to consider most options.   I will so put down money for a 1660ti laptop from framework.
The idea is cool, but $1,000+ for a laptop with no gpu and that you need to assemble on your own seems extremely steep.
constantly waiting for Linus to drop that laptop the WHOLE video
RIP website
That webcam is better than my phone's main camera. Bruh.
This is the kind of project I have always dreamed of working on.
If they only had a Ryzen 5000 configuration... Kinda been happy to be away from Intel.
literally the entire Thinkpad series: *am i a joke you?*  i'm proud and happy owner of a slim T460s and i feel completely left out.
Apple won't put up with all this sense! I feel a buy out coming  within months!
Damn it. If didnt have a laptop on preorder would have gotten this.
I've been waiting for this! I just hope they're available in the UK.
kinda hope they would open to the rest of the world..
A Laptop will never be "completely upgradeable".  The Motherboard ages. The Motherboard technology ages. The GPU technology improves. The CPU technology improves. The RAM improves. The COOLING methods improve.   You want to upgrade?  BUY A DESKTOP.  Otherwise, just get a new laptop every 5 years.  My last laptop was an Alienware R4 with a GTX 1060, 16GB DDR4 and a 256GB SSD.   $1600  back in 2018  I RECENTLY bought a TUF  with a 5800h,  3050Ti,  16GB DDR4 and a 512GB SSD  for $1099.   WHY WOULD I BE TRYING TO BUY PROPRIETARY PARTS AT PROPRIETARY PRICES to UPGRADE when I can buy all new hardware?
this actually sounds perfect! this is the kind of businesses i want to support, even if they cost a bit more. this IS gonne be my next laptop
"How is Framework gonna survive?" By not including Windows, you'll need to buy it urself (saw the activate windows watermark)
The best idea and option to upgrade a laptop I have ever seen
No AMD and way too expensive for what you get.
Yay, Linus is a wired mouse guy like me
Wow like it that way of structural spirit
13" and I will buy it
Does it have thunderbolt?
This thing is amazing!
This is gonna be my first laptop, if they launch in India, which I'm pretty sure they won't.
There is a good chance the tech giants would suppress framework.
Finally you guys do a video about it! <3
WE KILLED THE SERVER AYOOOO
If they had a higher end laptop with GPU then I would consider it
0:40 he bought a sponsorship how and why
Bravo Framework. You are on the right track. I was avoiding getting a laptop for years because I did not want to spend 2k on machine that will be dead after 2 year. Now I am really excited about getting one. I will definitely look into it
i think you broke there website its down linus lol
LTT - "Thanks to *blank* for sponsoring/featuring this video!" *Blank* company - "Thanks to LTT for DDoSing our websites!" Since 2010's
I am very interested
Power on AC attach, when your power button breaks, you now have a way to turn it on at least :) (end user friendly way)
I have had friends ask me about building a laptop for freaking ever, and now I can finally say yes
I guess we all know where to go to support a company so it doesn't dissappear in a few yrs and we can send a message to the bigger companies
If I was in the market for a laptop I would buy hands down this it what I always wanted
Linus you don't have patience that's why you use a wired mouse. A wired mouse has a lower latency 😅
Kudos to the amazing rack focus shot.
Watches the Framework website go down shortly after Linus releases the video. Me: "Well that escalated quickly. Popular idea is popular"
I think we broke the website guys 😂
Love it! Next stop upgradable CPU!
thin gorgeous and performant like  ill leave it to you
Well I'm in to support this company otherwise good things will never come.
The real struggle is getting any of these companies to support these upgradable devices beyond a generation, maybe two if you're lucky.
Framework should make a dock that can use the expansion slots, as well a small form factor desktop. This would create even more demand for expansion slots and hopefully lower the cost.
This is seriously cool. The big manufacturers should be embarrased.
Techs like this once in a blue moon is actually exciting and gives us hope for a wholesome future in tech industry
Okay…. That laptop is very epic gamers
Linus , there are no more videos with my namesake Denis....he is comical
"A fraction of a cent" Big Corporation: "I'm sure we can save more"
Louis rossman smiling in his chair
Not even 20 mins later and website crashed 60 mins later its still down
Even their YouTube channel is answering questions at the comments, who are they and why are they so kind
Btw just a heads up, the founder of Framework Nirav Patel has worked for Apple, Facebook and Google. So, I believe this guy definitely knows what he is doing!
I’m sad to see that it’s not a 2-1. It’s perfect in every other way
That webcam is FANTASTIC as a modular, upgradeable component. Also i've been waiting for manufacturers to switch using Gallium nitride charger for all of their laptops since forever
I am looking for a new laptop. Every single one had a huge "nono" which pushed me off. This laptop is so compeling, i am realy thinking i will buy it
Could it run games though? Or would I be able to use an external GPU to plug into an adapter for it?
Went to check the site and say "TAKE MY MONEY, I WANT ONE", but apparently it broke, probably because of the high traffic this video caused.
Sadly I don't see it becoming mainstream but it's pretty cool.
I will get one when they have a 15.6-inch display & a keypad witch happens soon!!
Goodix's Linux drivers are terrible.
0:41 Linus I'll change you world :sponsors pay you not you buy them
Do they build a dock to store a USB mouse dongle inside the laptop?
I FREAKING LOVE THIS
You make Framework website crash LMAO
Honestly, the main component I want to upgrade in a laptop is the graphics card.  But for a thin and light with integrated graphics, it's a great value proposition. I hope it suceeds and other manufactures pay attention. (And now also our terrible laptop webcams that no one thought they would depend on.)
I love the design ethics of this.  I just can't stand videos with Alex in them
well, their website has gone down. probably from traffic from here lmao
I think we crashed their website.
I bet this company will be gone by end of this year.
Make an AMD machine and I'm in. I've been wanting to replace my 7 year old lappy
just accept its   camera was way better
We want more !!!!
OMG, Please launch this in India, please please ....
Maybe capitalism can win us the right to repair fight, or at least help us
Your clumsiness is scaring other manufactures from doing this.
Holy shit, all the dislikes are coming from apple employees!  (probably)
The webcam looks great on their model!
Until Linus uses one as his daily device.... Until then, this is all talk.
ohh jeah the Site is down :-D  i think you Influenced some Peaple :-D
Next year: Panasonic collaborates with Framework to make a top-tier laptop!
Please God let them succeed my next laptop is a framework because I believe in this community
Ahhhhh one of the great perks of Capitilism.
if i can change my laptop with an anime skin i'll order one right now
No Crab Rave?
If they made a gaming laptop version, Id buy one!
I literally had this idea as a highschool student a couple of years ago and wanted to use magnetic parts that have newer versions released every other year.
Would back this, but a non-upgradeable CPU on the "COMPLETELY Upgradeable Laptop" makes this seem a lot more for marketing rather than actual progress in the right to repair movement.
That’s honestly amazing. And even though the CPU is soldered onto the mobo, it’a still technically a modular part due to the fact that they could literally just sell you a “CPU upgrade” that just requires swapping out the Mobo. Not to mention, if they offer discounts for trading in your old Mobo, I could see this being a really environmentally friendly option where you send back the old Mobo and they tear it down and recycle it properly while also reusing any pieces they realistically could or just simply reselling it as a used product for a discounted price for those people who may not necessarily want or need the latest and greatest CPU but maybe haven’t upgraded in 3 or 4 years
What a good time to be launching when right to repair is a hot topic.
Every single manufacturer on planet Earth: *wait that's illegal*
My HP gaming notebook looks similar and I can upgrade everything as you can with this laptop. This is nothing new!
56 minutes late
It was quite upgradable since this laptop is quite cool. I mean, it's 2021 and they got ourselves a upgradable laptop.
Their website is down, I believe Linus have just DDOS'ed them through Youtube ;)
Duuude, i love this.
Thx for my new laptop
I love the concept. It gets old and slow, you buy a new motherboard module and swap it out. You'll spend less money (probably) than you would on a whole new laptop. Additionally, it helps prevent eWaste because the rest of the parts are still good after all. All they would have to do is ensure they maintain the form factor of the main board.
breath of fresh air
Website under maintenance bah.
I think I'll get one once I have the money. Company's like these deserve to get the attention and money for development and further improvements and not heartless giants like Apple or Samsung or basically any tech corporation
Never felt such positivity around a laptop
You guys are making more reviewes than ealier. Im not good at english😶
Bulllllllllllshit
I'm in love already, Definitely my next laptop
This laptop is pure orgazm i love this company already, would change it right now agains my matebook d14 if i could :OOO and Linuxs driver support letsgo
Their site is so slow right now. 100% this video caused their site to crash. Hahaha.
I think we're killing their website.
He is still saying "cuopon" instead of coupon......Madison!!
Site is down
Now the next thing going beyond the desktop is to get more computer manufactures on board with making customizable laptops to upgrade over time. But however, if they want to go the complete desktop route with upgrading laptops, more companies have to get on board with similar screw design for laptop cases like with the motherboards that are universal across many companies (Like ATX, EATX Micro ATX, etc., but have its own naming scheme). Desktops have done this already to a far extant, but Laptops have to be next now.
i love this, everything should be like this. Frameworks rocks!
That cough😂😂
Waiting for europe shipping
I want one so bad
This is easily the most wonderful concept for a laptop I've seen.  I'd love to see an in-depth performance review of the system OotB, but this is phenomenal design.  I hope we see more content around it in the future!
So sick
The webcam was great and I would not complain at all
This is it😩❤
It is affordable and that is nice. I would pay the premium for it though.
I can replace the CPU in my T430 laptop.  Can change battery, add three drives, ram is upgradable, change the wifi card (with some difficulty), and change the screen.  But yeah, 2012 (but not 2010).  Their website isnt' working btw.
This ahead of its time.
Finally a laptop without a potato camera
Jesus christ, this is the bane of apple's existence. I hope this makes apple rethink how they make their devices
I need me one of these laptops!!
Imagine if you could add a powerful GPU to the laptop. this would be the best
Linus i want one too.
Really hope they take off. This is a great concept which would actually compel me to own a laptop.
i want one am sick of the build i have i want to upgrade
Framework employee 1:  what the hell happened to our website?  Framework employee 2:  Linus just reviewed our stuff  Framework employee 1:  we need a better website
i think we broke their website
"Doodad-a-ma-jigs". Once again Linus tries to dazzle us with overly-complicated technical jargon.
Magnetic charging cable adapters for type c already exist
This actually sounds super cool - I’ll be interested to see the long-term user report
...it's still horrendously expensive though -_-
nice work fellas their site isnt responsive now... do you all need a new toy?  xD
upgradable wireles modules????????? umm nooo very few manufacturers do not firmware lock there bios to allow such a thing
I want a 6 mont Framework update for the next years. Make this a series
I remember, when I was like 10 that my dad borrowed a laptop from somebody and it had swapable drives, you could put in a cd drive or even a floppy drive, it was from Dell, that's all I know
I remember reading about it a long time ago, but couldn't imagine that there will be so much attention to small things in this thing.   Also, shortly after this video was out, the site was down. I was one of those people trying to access it, because I genuinely want to support people doing something like this, almost humiliating other manufacturers for coming up with excuses for not doing something good for their customers. :D
Sad I didn't see this earlier. Was in the market for a new laptop and got a new one a few weeks ago. Would have gotten this, and I certainly will be looking into it at the end of this laptop's lifetime.
If there is a proper thunderbolt I/O damn this will be interesting with an egpu
This is one of the first products I've seen on LTT that I've actually said "OK, I'm probably gonna buy that." Lots of stuff is expensive or niche, but a laptop that I can tinker with and use for a long time is something I'll actually use and can afford.
Need to buy one, and website down... Daaaaaaamn..
Dosent ThinkPad have full sized CPU's in some of their laptops?
This is an absolutely beautiful laptop
11:54 linus.exe
Do they have plans to include graphics card modules later on? Because I think that'll create a lot of interest. Also, what's not to stop 3rd party suppliers from building and selling upgradeable parts, unless there are patents? How will they maintain profitability then?
Finaly, Unboxing retrieving it's golden glory. Nowadays what we get inside the prduct box are only cardboards 😑.
This came late cuz I already built a PC 😭
I think Linus just blew up their web site
Linus should invest in it
Honestly if i am to get a laptop, this would be the one
The website has crashed because of the amount of traffic. When people want something, it shows
If they make a decent RISC-V motherboard for this, and I can afford it (which requires it to be at least about Haswell-tier in laptop performance, combined with pricing that is below a 200$ premium over these Intel ones), I'm getting one.
I think I found my new favorite company
This video just crashed the site amazing 👏
guys, I think Linus likes this one
That is how I hope most PCs will be after right to repair becomes a thing.
Their website just crashed
Really surprised that Apple or Dell or another big company hasn't tried to either buy them out or lobby them out of business.
I might buy one!
too good to be true! but I'd like too see the possibility to install open source BIOS (core or libreboot) especially to get rid of IME
lmao the intro is straight up savage! your idiot hands cant repair it
Their website is down LMAO 😂😂
laptop cpu got pins .. they could have gone that route
i love there logo :P
Linus crashed their website.
I've been following these guys on IG for the longest time. Getting one of their laptops would be the dream after going through the pain of having my surface die on me and Microsoft basically screwing me over.
Man you're really should get a skincare treatment or perhaps some lashes those thumbnails are getting more creepier every day ☹️
This makes everything else in the market look stupid.
This is like dongles, but so much better.
Dang this product looks really exciting! You guys think they ship to mexico? :P
aaaaaand we crashed their website
It doesn't have a graphics card
I think you broke they’re website 😁😅 Only alittle wile after the drop of this video they’re website is down.
for a laptop that has modules like this, the battery is still internal. k
The website is no WORKINGGGGGG lol
You all crashed their website!
U should totally collaborate to get an LTT backplane or something, this seems like an incredibly promising product
iFixit score 100/10 🥰
Looks like we gave their website the Hug of Death.
This is amazing.
I said this in other videos talking about this laptop. I wish I knew, and waited for this laptop. I'm now stuck with a surface laptop 3
dang just went to look over there bcs I need a laptop in the very near future and... I think we broke the website lol
I think we gave their website the hug of death
17:13 oh would you look at that, just like how car parts used to be a major influx of money for motor companies.
Linus "How amazing is that?!" Tech Tips
we crashed the framework website?
Well, Linus. We've killed their website.
this is great. too bad there's no thunderbolt 3/4 option, or an option with a dedicated gpu (though that's probably WAY too much to ask).  honestly, these guys should introduce a "feature request with donation" option. i'd totally be down to dropping $100 to request eventual thunderbolt 3/4 support, and when it becomes available, be given the option to use my donation as a deposit for a purchase.
Linus, this video has literally caused their website to crash.
I’m sold. I need it
Louis Rossman just came
Framework's site already down...   I'd say there is a lot of potential for this style of engineering
Their website is getting so much traffic it won't load for me 😂. Good job making an excellent product Framework.
what a world of difference when devices are planned by engineers rather than businesses
I want to work for this company
And this, ladies and gentlemen, is what we want to see in the future. Just that simple.
This video brought up so much traction that even the website went down.
Feedback for Framework : Upgradable bottom cover with full of vents
Pretty sure this vid broke the website lmao
11:54 That was just beautiful!
For those wondering about baseline prices, as of July 26, 2021, The DIY Edition starts at $999, but the pre-built starts at $1,299. Linus got the DIY Edition, and you just watched him do all the work needed to set it up(would probably take 10 minutes or less). Additionally, they are working on schematics and assembly drawings for repair shops to use so you could have a more cheap, easy, and fast Motherboard repair.
But can it game?
I don't even need a laptop, I've got a Thinkpad T495, but I'm having a hard time not ordering one of these.
ACTIVATE WINDOWS :D
This is soooo cool
their website is getting demolished right now lol. I'm as excited as Linus to check this out!
I was hoping you'd try to plug the charger or other USB device directly into the on-board USB connector that the extensions go into. Just to see if they preform like normal USBc ports.
Seems like they hired a new editor
It's such an innovative idea. I hope we see more products like this.
Ahh, will there be a gaming version of this? THAT WOULD BE SO FREAKING AMAZING!
We just crashed frame.work's website... Back up in a stitch though! Even their website is easily repairable!
Linus crashes everything now its time for website
I would buy it for sure if its available on India :)
SITE IS DOWN
all nice and dandy, you should follow up in 2 years and see if their claims still hold up.
I hope this company succeeds and becomes a staple in the laptop business. It sure as hell deserves that.
if there where a swap able GPU...
Game changer
if Linus loves it so much it's gonna do wonders for this company, I hope they succeed
Very nice unit!
I have a question, so if the motherboard/ processor come as a single replaceable package can i swap out intel for AMD in the future or something like that ?
I usually don't comment on YouTube videos, let alone LTT. It's just like, and next.  I WANT MORE OF THIS. PLEASE LINUS, MAKE THIS THE NORM. You have the platform, the influence, and the resources.
I really hope it succeds!
l i n u x
You can bet your ass I'm ordering one the moment it's available in the UK. This is all I've been looking for and more! I was planning to go with tuxedo, slimbook or system76, but this steals the show.
Wont be surprised if they are targeted buy other companies
Damn. Y’all real Bitter at APPLE 🍎  Apple is king and you can’t stand it.  It’s okay tho - it’s just how you all #DealWithIt 😎
OMG! I need one! Do they sell to Brazil?
I remember seeing this on their website, and now it's finally here!
Linus is getting better at dropping things.
SITE IS UP
This is so great. I will 100% get one for myself as well!!!
You've crashed their website
Framework website just went down, RIP
Im sold too! If only I didnt already get a new laptop....
Did they dox Linus' preorder number on shown in the video?
If they can make a 16 or 17 inch blocky design laptop 16:10 or 3:2 aspect ratio, i’m sold 👌🏻
I like this
when a pool of talent meets pure, uncompromised engineering.
People loved the idea so much that their website was not ready for the load and crashed. Who would have guessed that when a company offers what the user wants will get so much attention.
Are they shipping these out to South Africa?
Sold, found my next laptop and recommending to anyone who's looking for one.
14:15 - the highest endorsement of this laptop
ref
This video just crashed the Framework site!
L.Rossmann is smiling somewhere
They r doing god's work
Looks great
What Apple lacks in repairable devices they make up for with COURAGE
We have slowed Framework’s website down to a crawl with the attention, good stuff
imagine frame.work reaching levels of apple and microsoft, and normal consumers actually getting satisfacted in buying the product, and not giving something of an apple tax. Seems subtle, but it will change the consumer market, and people thanking themselves for living in 21st century
Also I think you broke their site....
I wants!!!! What's next...maybe a little thicker I wouldn't mind bigger battery and gpu!
As a corporate IT guy that regularly has to crack open laptops, in order to fix random shit, I just got hard imagining a world where laptops were this easy to work on…  Even when you know how the shit is supposed to come apart, they make those little fucking clips so hard to separate with a thin enough plastic spudger, or guitar pick, that you end up using a metal one, and end up scuffing shit up.  Luckily I work in a factory, where users and the environment demolish these their damn laptops, so nobody even notices a few busted clips, a little scuff or slightly more flex in the case.  This on the other hand seems like an amazing experience, and I want one, but wish it had an AMD 5000 series CPU and discrete GPU, but I’d settle for an AMD mobile APU.  For the environment I work in, the only downside is that HP still has a docking system that’s super convenient and everyone in the office who has a more powerful ZenBook instead of the ProBook, hates the USB-C “Dock” which is just a brick sized dongle.  The ability to shut off the battery via BIOS would be great for me, because I have BIOS access, but if someone just made a special docking system that could flip that switch while it was connected would be badass, because I’d have to open these damn things less often—cuz it’s usually to change a battery.
If this was implemented earlier building laptops would be the new trend         Unlike building huge gaming setups
I want one, not because i need one, but because I believe this is the way forward.
Those excuses never held any water.
If they make a modular motherboard to upgrade cpu and gpu, I will jizz in my diaper
This is nuts
I want the future to be like this
I really hope they do well, if they continue like this I will be buying one the next time I upgrade my laptop
Any plans for models that support graphics cards? Surprised this wasn’t addressed.
LINUX SUPPORT WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LETS GO CRASH THEIR WEBSITE
LOL, as we speak their website went down... could access without a problem 10 minutes ago. Guess they'll be all sold out soon :( Well good for them!
i fell in love with frame.work
"The bottom doesn't matter." Imagine if everyone that walks around flexing their naked phones with fancy backs were suddenly going around flexing with the bottom of their Ultrabooks...
Oh Linus, I know you hate phone cases but look at what it got you :')
I'm am so impressed with what they've done. Thanks for reviewing this.
Nice
This is awesome. I'd love to see how durable they are. If this thing has durability features like a Thinkpad, I'm in. If it also has support for clean BIOSes like Libreboot, I'm definitly in. I'd love to 3d print new accessories for it too.
I'm looking at this and all I can think is how much I want this for the enterprise side of things.
The only thing I think this laptop doesn't have is a socketable CPU, although sadly it seems as though neither Intel or amd make socketed mobile chips anymore:(    (I still use my studio 1737 and going from a t6400 to a t9900 CPU felt like getting a new laptop)
Wait… why tf did the laptop not come with windows activated? Weird
If Linus talks shit about framework we riot.
Do watch ifixit video
Come to India as well. I hate dell and am bored with hp.
The literally took all OEM excuses and threw em out the window. Finally a Laptop that is proper innovation and value. (And you can certainly tell by Linus exitement)
Im gonna buy one of these only to support this amazing team. I want to see their future laptops designs. Only if they made them more thick because I love big laptops like my asus tuff 505something.
The sponsor was longer than 10 seconds wth Guys he's on to us
Great product! 👍😁
I. Need. Now.
I want to buy one
This is such a great video that I am immediately watching it a second time. Really fantastic job on the video, for what appears to be a near-perfect product.
This is a company I would risk my own money and actually invest in.  Good on Framework inc to attempt to bring this to market. i been wanting a solution that allows me to change modules for what i need easily
The website is crying for help right now😂  I've been waiting 5 minutes for my cart to open.  Edit: "Franework is undergoing maintainence right now"
Their website is down, I just tried to place a preorder but it wont even load
All it needs is an igpu
i guess we are all crashing their configuration website right now?
Steve Jobs is rolling in his grave right now. lol
7:19 missed opportunity to say "Yeah, we've got one"
nice.
not enough room people want thin laptops what about gaming laptops like the alienware m51
Aaand their website's down We did it #LTT
The only issue i see with color coded is color blindness
Website experiencing Hug of Death.. lol and its not even a hour or so since the video went up !
This thing is awesome
The video ends ...aaaaaand frame.work is DDoSed
Hackintosh Lovers Unite! Please make a 16/17" option. Im drooling over this! Dual NVMe, a 99Wh Battery, high res display, Gpu modules. Please!!!
Did we break their Website with just around a 100k Views? DAMN
the most happy unboxing for Linus in years maybe decades
people need to comprehend that the current 'all-soldered-on'  practices are consequences of the fiat currency model. Apple/Dell/Lenovo economists and engineers made a conscience choice to survive the current fiscal model. Business is not charity.
This is amazing, I would totally buy one if they had an AMD option
That's insane i love it
Now waiting for the gaming varient
Their website is having a major stroke due to all the ltt viewers tryna buy rn
This is basically everything I want in a laptop. The site is getting hugged to death right now, but as long as they have a UK keyboard option I'm extremely interested in replacing my Blade 15.
If only this came out BEFORE i bought my laptop for college :(
That's fine and all Linus but the real question is can it run Doom???
So.... any tips on how to convince my spouse I need to buy a new laptop again? :)
Honestly the best thing ever
I was waiting for so long for this Video! 😃
i want it but cant afford it after buying my current laptop 4 months ago.  :(
I believe you have crashed their website, cant enter on any of my devices😂
Gaming on it?
You have completely crushed Framework's website. Hugged to death.
I'm waiting for CPU upgradability, but this is awesome. Currently sitting there with my Core i7 X1 Yoga and angry that I cannot upgrade to 32/64GB RAM or a better CPU. Maybe they'll have another version in the future with GPU and CPU upgrade option, then I'm totally sold. The price seemed reasonable as well!
Take my f*ckin' money. NOW. Linus I love you too. This is the most genuine and totally honest video I ever seen on YT.
I love how Linus almost drops the laptop . Not a a Linus video without something happening due to clumsiness.
So I guess since Linus didn't drop this thing, he crashed their website instead??!
Does anyone know if they are planning on making a 2 in 1 model of this, with a laptop mode and a tablet mode with a 360° hinged touchscreen? If they will, add a quality stylis and I will happily buy one of those in a heartbeat.
I saw linus drop tips he dropped somenthing
Why is Linus making you all wear masks just get the Vax
If I can't upgrade the GPU, I'm not interested
This is amazing. I HATE how most of the low/lowmid-end reputable-manufacturers laptops have 0 upgreadability, trying to buy a notebook for school for my has been a pain in the ass... you see a fairly good specs but with "4GB RAM" and I'm like "no problem, I'll buy this and a 16 GB sodimm module" and IT'S NOT UPGADEABLE. People are being left to buy a laptop and upgrade it on the road. This was needed. I hope they do real well in the future.
framework websites down lmao
I'm going to point out that framework's website seems to be having intermittent issues.  I blame Linus.
Trying to access frameworks website. I think it's hugged to death haha
The site is down I want to preorder lol
I look forward to this company becoming huge in the industry.
I'm sharing this on all my social media, I want these guys to make it!
This reminds me of my hp elite book from 2013. It didn’t even need a screwdriver to do a ram upgrade. And the bios has features like boot on lid open and boot on ac power, as well as desktop (no battery) mode
They thought of everything, except for linus making a video causing their website to crash XDDDD
Ahhhhh.. i love it huge middle finger to all other manufacturers. Forget the steam deck, this is what I want.
I think we crashed framwork's website lol
This looks really cool! I would've liked more details on if the trackpad and keyboard are actually any good, though.
I was waiting for this framework laptop review on Linus tech tips since i was planning to buy it.
half an hour after the video launched - Framework page is pretty slow :D  Keep it up guys!
This is what I was waiting for before I put in an order! Saw this thing about a month ago and was excited but wanted to see some more hands on. Hopefully the website is back up soon!
I think we killed their website folks
The bios options reminded me to the Good Old Thinkpad T470's (When the were customizable as those). FREAKING GREAT PRODUCT!
They need to bring this laptop to India. Framework should use the PLI scheme which the Indian government introduced to boost electronic and laptop manufacturing, thereby reducing their production cost.
LTT gave the website the hug of death
first 5 minutes and I'm considering buying just on principle
So Linus tell us which anime show do you love? Please tell us!
7:21 "displayport port" has enhanced energy from "PIN number" or "ATM machine"
one of my considerations on my last laptop upgrade cycle was repairability. My choice was the Hp Envy X360 15 (2019) , which looked super easy to teardown in the videos I watched. I've actually not opened it up yet since then but It's still super reassuring to know I can without thinking. :)
if i can easily use the display, track pad and keyboard  with a raspberry pi or something like that, after the cpu is outdated, count me in!
I feel like this is really cool but as linus mentioned unless u can replace the motherboard it's not doing a whole lot for me
Who is watching this after world war 3? You.......cockroaches!?
I'm so happy you're covering this laptop. It seems like a very interesting concept that I hope can hold some ground.
This is the only laptop to buy if your budget allows.
Linus crashed there webpage lmao
Wait a sec I'll boot my work from home computer so I can like this video twice.
If one day i need a laptop.  I will definitely go with Framework. But for now i absolutly dont need a laptop. so rip.
Linus posts vedio Website crashes
Absolutely great product, I dont know why the tech giants have just become such losers
Does it work well with linux?
I've been legitimately waiting for this video.
Only way this is worth it is if you buy the base model i5. They’re up charging out their ass for the i7 models 🙄
That Webcams looks better than any ive seen in recent revies lmao
i need it now to figure out how to tell my parents that i wan't a new school laptop
we need one that's a little bigger and has an MXM slot
Oh boy, Project Ara for laptops!
that gskill case actually looks kind of sick
It's so awkward when a company seems to care about the consumers
Best thing 👍👍
If Lego designs a Laptop:
If you can afford one and you need a laptop, please support this idea. My next laptop will definitely from Framework. But for now, my PC is working perfectly and i've no need for a laptop, plus i'm broke.
Hopefully they make a thunderbolt 3/4 or USB 4. An egpu would be very cool.
If ever there was a time to vote with your dollar, it seems to be now!
EUROPE! (feels left behind)
This video crashed framework's website
Great great model... Question. How Can one easily get the schematic and boardview to fix the motherboard?
I'm just stunned. I've been waiting for something like this forever, and with this quality.
Way back when, Apple's PowerBook G3 had a system of modular components you could slot in and out as needed: batteries, floppy drives, CD-ROM drives, PCMCIA slot receptacles, etc. I'm glad to see the concept's return. :)
OMG if I hadn't JUST bought a new laptop...  This might be in the cards for my wife however.
The Frame.Work website went offline minutes after this went live 😂
The framework website is currently experiencing the Linus hug of death.  Hopefully I can snag one of these.
Hahaha I think you just crashed their webpage! It's unresponsive or working veeeeeeery slow...
I was about to use my credit card even tho I'm flat broke but there site is down 😿
Sold......
I'm hoping that this will set a precedent for laptops in the future. You can tell how much Framework is pouring their effort into the user's experience and it shows. The site went down soon after writing this, from the traffic/product orders from people that have been *wishing* for this for a very long time. I'm very excited to see what new modules/customization comes out, and hope to pre-order soon (Once the site is up again ;w;)
If they come out with a Ryzen based model I'm in :)
Next laptop upgrade I know where I am going.
Very good, but I worry that the demand won't be there as consumers actually prefer ignorance and tech disposability, at least in the US.
The way Linus was shaking that laptop with the screen up gave me so much anxiety because I've lost two to broken hinges..
The website is slooooow right now. another accidental dos, just told me to please check back in a few minutes...
Something happened... Frame.work is down for maintenance 😂
The use ac power only thingy should be on every laptop imo.
So it's like what Alienware was trying to be before Dell bought them.
Never thought a thing like this could exist 😭 It's beautiful
Because of Linus the Framework is down!!!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I want that!
Nice Amazon delivery
I came here to say I have taken on a policy never to click on a thumbnail with a wacky face, ever again.  Thumbs down.
Now just never change the form-factor of the motherboard, and we have the perfect laptop.
Color coded screws, QR codes, Labels, and informative documentation. Linus: Let me install the wifi leads backwards its not like they are color co.......
And the dell is in't even F*** thinner, first actual rofl for a while
I’m seriously impressed with this laptop due to upgradability and improved repairability. I just hope they add a dedicated GPU or a much better CPU similar to the M1 chip in future as I need a lot of performance as a video editor who’s always on the go. If Framework can address those points I’ll be ditching my MacBook Pro overnight. :)
Has been a while I got excited about a laptop...Looks freaking awesome!
Remember this: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/motorola-announces-project-ara-a-modular-phone-hardware-platform/  This is likely just round 2...
Annnnnd their website is down...
Linus, the audience was thrilled and I'm among them.. but... the producer website is down .. I guess all of us want to see the wonder :))
11:32 *cough cough*
Their website got the linus hug of death
Imagine if this system was apply on the display like i wanna play boom i take the QHD 165 hz or i wanna watch a movie boom 4K display
I WILL TAKE YOUR STOCK framework
from $799, that's quite a decent price... i guess i know what's my next pc buy.  i am really looking for a laptop that isnt deadweight when something gets too old or  not in stock anymore  now i think youtube viewers hitting their website...HARD... its having outages/"maintenance" message
Louis Rossman is gonna love this
Excluding modular IO and internal QR codes, this is very similar to servicing ASUS TUF laptops. A recent FX705 I chassis swapped internals and screen to an undamaged bottom and top case/keyboard (trackpad is easily removable too) only took about 20 screws and no glue. Hardest part of the job was tracking screw lengths and where they go, which I just use MS Paint sketches.
Numberpad and then I'm buying one! :D PS OUCH that note 9 looks hurt. Mine is also suffering as I think the battery is old now :(
This is the product I would dream about when I first got into computers. Spent many sleepless nights dreaming of how it could be done effectively
Great idea behind this Laptop   RIGHT TO REPAIR is a serious thing.
Just not practical. I have seen stuff like this for years and nothing ever comes of it.
The way he said the dell is not even fucking thinner I knew that was It
Everyone needs to support this to show laptop devs this is what we want
Didn't... The sponsor buy the.. sponsorship for the video? Linus, have you been buying your sponsors ads for them... Smh
haha website crashed. They basically got DDoS'd by LTT.
Yup, the website crashed. I guess a lot of people are excited about this laptop.
Yh already decided I was getting a couple days ago legit answers all the issues I had with buying a laptop
Linus is in hallucination Framework will blow off soon
Fucking hell. The future of computing is coming.
This right to repair in action.
cant even go on the website rn to many people lol they about to make BANK hope they do well
damn that is flippin' awesome i really hope these guys make it in a long run and that these devices become the gold standard of the industry 🤩👍
No most of new nice ultarbooks that I checked, have soldered memory and even soldered wifi module, so this Framework can be my next laptop easy
I'm guessing Linus' laptop already got delivered with how casually he showed off his order number. Don't do that folks.
probably not the legends we deserved but the legends we needed
Oh man, I regret buying a laptop last year.  I would definitely of spent the extra on something like this.  ***Added to the Wish List***
This should hopefully be really good. I will note that as Linus said there is still a lot that is not really replaceable and those are the CPU and Motherboard components.  Framework need to make a slightly thicker laptop for cater to the more professional users and then work in some replaceable CPUs and core components. While I do love my MacBook Pro, iPad and thin devices that I use regularly. For some journeys I would love something more beefier that had replaceable components to extend the life span of products that can cost quite a lot.   I defiantly think there is a market there. Also the thicker case would still be compatible with the components in this laptop, but also ability to take larger or thinker CPUs and motherboards would be such a win.
Can't wait to see their Warranty terms
Can we stop talking about the (great) laptop an just focus on linus phone  - 1:56 - That thing probably got dropped a lot!
the website is still crash lol gotta love linus bring attention to things like this hope they grow into something huge
I guess we gave it the good old hug of death.
I watch all of the content on this channel for this, you never know when something is going to blow you away and make you a believer.
Framework's site is down because of Linus, GG
My Lenovo laptop is also quite straightforward in providing parts lists and videos on how to swap parts and repair it yourself. Not that modular tho but it's pointing in the right direction on repairability.
As a family tech repair man, I am getting my whole family this laptop right now. Literally solves all my problems, and does not break my bank!
Imagine gaming laptops like this  Gamers: aight this 1070 sucks lemme put a freakin rtx 3090 in it  edit: wow thx for 50 likes in 1 day
I legitimately HATE working on laptops, I'm mean that in the repairing sense. But this honestly looks like it would be easy to repair. I don't have the spare cash now, but in the future when I need a laptop, I could see ordering one of these.
the power switch is not part of the keyboard! you have no idea of how meany keyboards are replaced just cause the stupid power key stooped working!!!
The biggest achievement for linus is he did the stunt where he flipped the laptop without dropping it
This seems great, but I guess we gave their website the hug of death lol
Have all Linux users migrate to this!
It's the Land Rover Defender of Laptops 😁
The only thing I'm left wondering about is the GPU upgrade path. CPUs are soldered, sure, but GPUs are talking over PCI-express so in principle it should be possible to slot them, via some SFF PCIe connector (like M.2) and a back-shell mounting spot alongside the motherboard. This is, no joke, something that's been grinding my gears for years - if the current product offers GPU replacability/upgradability, or when a future version gets it, I might have to buy one just on principle.
There website is tanked right now, lol.  I don't even need a laptop, but I want one.
This is the kinda product, and more importantly company, that makes me excited about tech
Please don't let this company die! this has to be the future
Motorola Project Ara would like a word with you before you invest...  I would bet money someone from that team ended up at framework after Motorola was bought by Lenovo. They canned the project.
I saw this a few days ago and put off buying one. Looking at the site now, I shouldn't have waited.
1:58 Broken note 9 but I watched jerry rigs note 10+ swap before this video.Youtubars are stiking with their old phone that’s really awesome.
let us pray that some big company doesn't buy them and force them to stop this practice
Love such videos and devices. Thank you very much. Greets from Bavaria in Germany
Felt really good about LTT featuring the fairphone website. Those guys are doing something right, even though the devices themselves aren't anything special
1:37 almost end up in a "Linus dropping things" vid
There is only 2 points that this laptop lacks for what I have saw in their page, AMD ryzen cpu option and dedicate gpu options.
This is type of product we should support. Love it.
I've been eyeing this laptop for ages, hoping that Linus would review it, and here we are <3 Can't wait for them to get some more modules out for even more options
this is very inspiring, made the hair on my arms rise up. especially the self assembly feature on a laptop would make want one just to lego it. and then never buy another laptop brand. because fake lego sucks ? (makes sense to me)
All the right to repair forums and groups worldwide should promote framework and support them build up on this! Didn't see Linus this excited about a new device for years!
Finally, a laptop that could most likely be designed with a ortholinear keyboard or something Atreus-like.
When a garage band underground tech startup is more organized, has more organic thought management skills, is more open to it's perceived consumer base, is more in touch with the tech community, and has a better overall feel and build quality to its next FIVE major brand name competitors.  Buying stock, buying the laptop, sending them a thank you card, looking into investment options.
rly cool
I just saw the future! That's amazing.
Hope this finds a lot of traction!
LTT viewers are hugging frame.work to death RN
sadly I spent   $1700 on a odd shoddy thinkpadx1tablet  so ill prob wait till next year
This is linus proof laptop. If it fall down he can just lego it back
This is the way.
Congrats. You killed their website. :)
Welp now their website is down…
This is great AF!
Looks like LTT overwhelmed the frame.work server.
Basically what I wish my M1 MacBook Air would be 😂😢
Next laptop I am buying is framework.
What kinda video card do these have in them?
Great product, great execution, and great timing. I'm sold. Let's just hope they're around for the long haul.
I wanna invest too
This is the future. Finally a manufacturer with consumer in mind
Did Adele really promised this kind of upgradability?
This is actually awesome. Hope this becomes a success and I can buy one someday. Just keep up the quality that's all is needed.
Let's take Framework to the moon so we will have this thing in the future and it becomes a gold standard. I repaired a couple of laptops for my friends and families and I would get furious for all kind of non-senses manufactures do with their laptops. Some won't boot to usb without attached hdd/ssd, some won't boot if the laptop is not complete assembled, some won't boot if a part has been upgraded or changed and so on. I have seen a lot of thick af laptop with more wasted space and less upgradability. I want framework to become like ifixit for laptop with upgrade modules, etc and much more. This is the kind of laptop want to buy. Slim, rigid and upgradable af!
I think their site crashed! 😐
I want it.
LG has a magnetic charge adapter for it's v60 series. Screw A$$le and Micro$uck, lol. This laptop should be the standard! I love the battery disconnect in the bios, I literally tell every customer about unplugging/ removing the battery if plugged in for long periods, which blows that most batteries are non-removable now.
How does it handle Linux (Ubuntu)? Any driver issues?
Way kool !!!
lol that laptop is 10 better than my pc :D   is gt 1030 still good with ryzen 3? i want to buy them so i have a better pc :(
Other than the tiny gpd laptops, i haven't cared about laptops for years. I don't even need one and I wanna give them my money. I hope they stay around, they'll probably become my go to once I actually upgrade.
Well my dudes you just saw what happens when Engineers are left to do their craft with just their talent skill and passion
But Linus, you put the Wi-Fi antenna cables on wrong. You put white on black and black on white. Silly Linus.
The website is getting destroyed by all the traffic from this video..
Linus definitely didn't give a Tech "Tip" to Framework at 15:25
Great to see, would save a lot of ewaste.
I want this to succeed.
everything great except the logo make it look like a Toysaurus item.
this video reinforces my hate for apple. so glad i stopped buying their product
LOVED IT
I think their website crashed, lolz
And they are offline… the impact of Linus Tech Tips…
Louis Ross man be like👀
Conzoomers
It reminds me of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a group of people that make such awesome things. This is game changing, I hope their will be an AMD model though.
is their site overloaded? It just wont load for me :,D
What happened to the one similar to this a few years ago? There was a laptop and a phone you could click together in separate blocks
When this configurable laptop is better than HP’s flagship non-repairable laptop
shame its just an ultra thin, would be nice to see that aproch in gaming and productivity laptops. All tho the bandwith limitations of USB 3.2Gen 2x2, still scares me a bit, theres diff gonna be some limits with this design.
i want linus media group to sponsor this company
So I just read the article on this and now watching Linus review this. Perfect timing!
Linus, you broke their website! Lol
When you don't think about money and think about creativity that is what happen
id love to see an arm model witch i can easily get Linux on
So cool
'Only 5 screws to pop the bottom off' Well, it usually only takes me one but okay.
I'm not an idiot, you are!
This is perfect for my kids starting the requirement for laptops for school as early as 3rd/4th grade. I may have missed it and realized he said the mobo can run outside of the laptop, but did he mention if the mobo is swappable as well?
Their website is down right now, the traffic spike had to be huge because this is awesome
damn
Damn that is awesome. Unfortunately I don't have a need for a laptop right now but will definitely recommend it to people I know. Hats off to Framework!
Replacible camaras. Me: PUTS A FREAKIN DSLR ON A LAPTOP
pogchamp
We successful broke there site Linus hope we can spread awarnes for great things like this. Even more Looking forward to a real performance Review once its out.
Fuck, this is the real power of engineering not business
Everything except from the logo on the back is great. If only it was a bit smaller!
This is absolutely groundbreaking.  I wish they continue to be able to make awesome products like this.
Waiting for dave2d to cover this.
no shit ppl overcrowded their website
Every time I watch something simple and affordable. for some reason I imagine Tim Cook doing "Billions of Dollars" pinky finger skit.
words cant express my feelings for this thing
The only real way we can go modular is if we have a new motherboard standard for laptops. Like we have ATX, mATX. Socketable mobile CPU-s and ultra-low profile GPU adaptor boards.
Website’s down. Congrats to them
Really looking for the long term review, very interesting laptop
that's how you say, 'screw you' to Apple
Specs please
Myon
Edit: Website seems to be very slow from people coming from this video 😅  Eh. Probably over a 1000 or som ONLY 799!?!  :O
Fantastic idea.  If I needed a laptop, I would buy this.  It's sort of a poor-man's version of the Panasonic FZ-55.  I hope that the company is successful and the idea catches on.  No wired ethernet, though?
If Apple would stop doing things to make their equipment unrepairable it wouldn't be difficult. The stuff like attaching "authentication" to parts like the screen is pure cancer and designed to stop you from repairing the device yourself only.
This is the most user friendly laptop
Wow this thing is amazingly well put together.  When it comes to customizability, I can see them possibly collaborating with other companies for help.  Perhaps Dbrand?
it kind of sucks that the blocks only have 1 port on them, even though 2 type c could fit on 1...but you kinda have to go looking for a gripe like that...
well will the big tech learn something or will profit hide this??
This is so sick what.
This Laptop ist so Awsome. 😍😍🥰🥰
I think this review may have DOS'd their US website.
And it was only 99.99.99.99! (That's a reboot reference in case you didn't get it)
lol we crashed the framework website
And now the website is down.  Thanks Linus. Stop making companys money and causing longer then normal wait times.
I hope this doesn't run into the same wall as other initiatives like it; namely the non-existent upgrade modules in the future.
The site crashed :D I am really happy everyone wants it! Please make them survive. We want more of these.
Talks about how great it is that all the screws and connections are color coded Immediately plugs the wifi card in with the black wire going to the white port and the white wire going to the black port Nice
this deserves to be bought
Hope they do well and continue to make components - upgrades for years. This is pretty much why i never got a laptop so far. Making it upgradeable sounds amazing
I don't need a new laptop at the moment, but when I do I hope this is still around and that they ship to europe by then.
great, next time tell them they need to prepare the website for traffic when you upload
This is awesome!
One positive video from LTT and their website is down within minutes!
u r a week late
Ey! Saw this a while ago! Glad to se you cover it here!
I've been considering buying a new laptop since my last one from college (over 7 years). I've been holding off but this laptop gets me excited for sure. Like Linus says, I might order one today!
As a person who would more likely build my wife and kids PCs as opposed to prebuilding them. I want one of these to use as my work laptop.  It's just...I love the stylus and touch screen on my current laptop. Makes grading my students' homework soooo much easier.  Crossing my fingers that they'll make an option for a screen and stylus in the future.
"the dell's not even fucking thinner" Thanks Linus I busted out laughing at work and now my coworkers think I'm insane
11:53 and 18:19 best moments in the video ihmo.
Their website just experienced a moment, sweet hug of death
oh wow, i was just looking for a laptop for very light gaming, emulation, and video consumption. This is extremely tempting to the point that i think its the only choice now.
I think their website was not ready for this video… 😂 it is down
Microsoft needs to sell these too!
Im really impressed by the design, quality(by looks) and expension. Willd efinetly consider it! i hope thesy keep it up. A German layout would needed
I don't have or use laptops that often, but I'm in love 😍
So... they solved the 'I need too many dongles' argument with.... more dongles? Don't get me wrong, this is super cool, but... this is just dongle-mania here.
EVERYBODY! GET IN HERE AND BUY THIS LAPTOP! IT'S PROBABLY ONE OF OUR LAST CHANCES TO OWN OUR LAPTOPS!
WHOOOO! GO FRAMEWORK! They seem to be fill a niche in the industry that has been missed for a very long time!
its amazing that LTT is the third video ive seen on this
Guys.. we're crashing the website. We're all hyped here! ^^
that looks just like my lenovo ideapad 3 15iil05
“THE DELL’S NOT EVEN F*****G THINNER!!” Had me laughing so hard at work man 😂
I guess Linus really is rubbing off on people to come up with a laptop he really likes...
Didn't G.Skill bought that segway from u tho?
Wow the site crashed Thanks linus
i think i just found out my future laptop maker..... i just hope i can find them down here
I guess dropping the video took the website down. Whatever wanted to order rn, will still order later to support the case. That's just awesome
I wish they have 16 or 15 inch version.
Their website crashed after this video came out.
The bigger brands only need to go back to the 2000 norm to compete with framework: standard ports, exchangeable storage and memory.   The ultimate fix is actually at the fiscal side: the fiat printing has to stop before companies are forced to chase limited gold. In the current mode (where all could get cheap credit) both buyer and manufacturer don't care.
I can't wait for this one to become available generally.
Now make this a standard with compatible parts available from multiple vendors.
Clevo (variously rebranded as Sager, Eurocom, etc.) offers even more user upgradable laptops with upgradable CPUs and upgradable MXM GPUs (sometimes models even offer dual MXM slots for SLI configurations) and significantly higher RAM densities and drive densities (while I haven't tried to run an OpenZFS RAIDz3 on one, it seems maybe viable).  Novena Kosagi, from 2014, offered complete schematics, and 0 NDA to get more information on it.  In other words, there are better options already extant on the market for those who sincerely want more longevity and documentation than Framework, already.  Moreover, your mention of Microsoft and Apple having exclusive rights to magnetic charging systems seems questionable at best. Zojirushi water boilers have had magnetic power plugs long before Apple's MagSafe was ever a thing. Having previously helped recreate prior art to invalidate spurious patent claims for the likes of Fortune 25, precedence and prior art is acknowledged in courts of law. It may be true that Microsoft or Apple were granted patents on their specific implementations of such technologies, but there is absolutely nothing preventing others from implementing their own variants. Also see: the plethora of USB-C magnetic charging options, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv3o2rxqYMg  Albeit, having used some of the USB-C magnetic variants, I still think Apple's MagSafe was a far superior implementation of such things.
I am seriously considering one myself, but I am hoping they make a 16 inch version with some dedicated graphics. Or even AMD processors in there.
Adam Savage's Tested (one of the Mythbusters current YouTube channel) just did a video about they synology NAS. Yall should reach out about setting an storage upgrade. They need to support 1-4 editors working on the footage
we gave the site a hug of death
So refreshing to see Linus genuinely want something. I hope that Framework succeeds.
I think their website is down from everyone visiting
We need something like this for phones! I remember there was a modular phone years ago that never gained enough traction, but it would be awesome in today's world!
OMG just look at that webcam! It puts the 2000$+ laptops to SHAME! SHAMEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I enjoy how there website is Super slow atm, Prob cuz of this video
mechanical webcam shutter and hardware mic switch? @technologyconnections is typing....
The port selection tho… and no tb ports…
would love for socketed cpus to come back, or to add special pci-e big cards to expand cpu, chipset and gpu.
I usually don't like many videos because I put them in my meme playlist, but this is amazing. This laptop is incredible. Hopefully I can get one of theirs once my current laptop loses steam, because this looks AWESOME.  Love your work, Linus.
you can just use a usb c magnetic cable and rewire it to the charger... just make sure the cable can handle 60w of power
You know what i would love? a clear plastic option.
Honestly this is the best laptop choice for me and everyone
I can't believe it's this good. I am importing one to India right away.
I wish I had the money and justification to buy one just to support the idea. I almost exclusively use my desktop for most of my use cases. So my laptop has a completely drained battery, that I had to disconnect to use wall ac. That bios configuration on the framework laptop would've been fantastic.
The Website is literally down
I'm buying one today if there's a Ryzen version
Anker had a magnetic type C charging port.
If you guys would have used Linux as os in it, WHOLE SETUP WOULD BE OPEN AT ETERNAL LEVEL
lois must be sad they no send him 1 to play for
Hello linus, i play apex legends on intel uhd and i get at  most 40 fps after  playinh for a while on lowest graphics and on 1024×768... do yk any ways i can get  better frames?
I’m glad framework is getting attention.
This is amazing for tech enthusiasts, but its not hard to see why it doesnt work for the normal consumer. Can you imagine the warranty nightmare of all the angry karens who brick it and then demand a refund or replacement?
Why no red chips tho?
it would be great if in 2 years framework released a special edition Evangelion chassis, or maybe a gundam themed chassis
I think your video is crashing their websites
So many people are going to the site that it crashed.
The site got ddosed after this review 😁 (by the amount of people going on the site)
HAHA. I just watched this exact laptop on PCworld Channel. Weird.
Nothing quite like advertising a product when you can't go to their website because it's under maintenance lol
Dbrand would be perfect
This will very likely be my next laptop!
Yooooo I wish I needed a laptop
If that laptop was 360degree and touch, i would buy it right away. Couldnt Framework sell a Cover/bag that is small, but has pockets for the upgradable modules so I don’t have to carry them separate?
You can just pop off the bezel and replace it?? This thing is wild! Lmao
Just the mention that these were apple, lenovo and HTC engineers had me excited. With all three you know they won't cut corners, and with the latter two you know every penny is well spent.  The design screams 'ideapad' and I love it. Those are some of the sexiest machines out there.  This might not be so much of an 'upgradable' laptop (as it is with the currently available parts), but it's a right to repair wet dream! As long as the replacement parts will be in production for many years to come, this is basically as repairable as a car.  It also made me realise that Lenovo's machines are actually pretty repairable already, if only they had the parts easily available. I don't want to use ebay for dodgy screens.
i have ever actually been in aw with how much a company cares about their consumers
Their site wasnt upgradeable enough.
As much as I'm all for this, is a device really "COMPLETELY" Upgradable when the most important upgradable components can only be bought from the manufacturer? It just seems like free labour at this point, why not make everything cloud based so that it actually benefits normal users and not only the tech enthusiast crowd? Just like we get electricity from the grid can't we use the cloud to run heavy applications such as games and access our data? That would be the real upgrade
legit crashed their website
*INVEST INVEST INVEST*
This laptop is very exciting and I'm excited to see what they make next!
Linus sold himself. You know it's good when that happens!
Imagine a System 76/Framework marriage.....
The store is on maintenance. Seems like LTT crashed it :D
This is the first time in my nearly 30 years of life that I am genuinely excited for a laptop
BEST! Buying one now!
That webcam is great It's very clear
Looks like they got hugged a little too tightly by Linus...
They should upgrade their servers lol
its between this and a system 76 laptop... oooo this is a hard  choice
lol we killed their website, i can't get to their site lol
Bruh I think frameworks website crashed just after you uploaded this review 😂
Yeah it's good and all but is anyone gonna use it.  Reply
I hope the best for Framework
I'd love one of those beefy paramedic lookin field laptops tho.
You crashed their website.
Soldered RAM is useful.
just imagine  using your laptop as a Minecraft server, VPN server or NAS server after you got tired of it easily  man i love this puppy
I tried to check the door but i think it crashed
billions and billions and billions... this is next gen, because is green. If you can recycle it and keep use it for years to come, definitely GREEN, definitely good.  tnx I'll check more into this company
The anti-Apple laptop. Show this laptop to Louis Rossman.
he sounds like a kid
I'm beyond impressed. My next laptop is going to be a framework. its good enough to make me switch back to linux after using osx as a daily driver for 10 years
So basically this is apple in parallel universe.
I don't strictly need a new laptop, but I might just get this so I don't get a Dell or an Asus or an LG when I do need it cause I've forgotten.
Sounds like Project: Ara but this one doesn't die.
not gonna lie, i like that feature where you can toggle to not using the battery at all and just using power from the wall
So sad. I brought a new laptop 2 months ago. I defo would have gotten this instead if I'd known
I say you shoulkdn't have an iPhone, Mac Book aor any garbage products
15:06 Bruh I love how their webcam is straight up better than 70-80% of laptops out there.
I've been looking at buing a new laptop recently and with the love that framework has been getting here and at Tested i think i will hold off til they start shipping in Europe and go for this one.
Dang. Good timing that this is coming out. Starting college soon and this is seeming like a interesting laptop contender
Its so cool to see device like this. Just the option of custom key print is amazing when you are stuck with qwerty/gwertz layouts mixed on every laptop in your country :).
Omg wow, I almost want to buy one too support their brilliant work
I hope this reaches SEA X_X
this cant b legal
Imagine if laptop biggest strenght would be modular designs that allow you to take few spare parts on the go and do different things on 1 device (instead of ooga booga it mobile you could be gaming on train). You could have spare outside battery, a projector, graphic card (for hardcore gaming) or many others. Current laptops offer 0 advantages from tablets, smartphones or stationary PCs and are basically useless. This laptop is a great idea
I really hope they stay and flourish in the consumer market
a glimpse of a future worth living in, that is rare. i really hope this scares the old guard into taking some pro consumer actions. although i fear this team will just get Epsteined.
ahhhh the windows watermark, we meet again.
Apple
Did we Hug of Death their website?
I think a really smart move for them would be to have sort of partnership with dbrand in the future. Just imagine the media when people start having extremely custom laptops tailored to their likely instead of plain silver or black. Could really push this thing to success
I think we crashed the website already
Linus... You broke their website.... Guess it's a nice first world problem to have.
This is a very good laptop, go buy and external gpu and it eill be a portable gaming machine
Looking at the title I was skeptical, but after watching the video Okay, I'm ordering one right now
I think we killed the website...
This laptop is absolutely insane
hi Linus, hi everyone, " cool little laptop, some nice features", :)
You didn't talk about gaming 🙄
we really need to support this so that this kind of design engineering becomes a norm
Now give it options for touchscreen and wacom digitizer with a pen and it's perfect.
hope more companies will follow and have laptops be like cpu's where people can assemble their own and have them cost considerably less than prebuilt ones. best part would be the ability to add processing power over rgb for less cost. i always go for utility than useless aesthetics on my computers.
Might go buy right now.   *edit* Did go and buy it, this thing is amazing. Go buy it if you need a laptop.
Your IDIOT hands couldn't repair IT... never laughed so hard at Linus before
Been waiting for this video lets go!
14:40 Alex, you better hope Sarah doesn't watch this video.
Even for someone as tech illiterate as me, jesus christ that's awesome.
The "iKea" - you know, because the some assembly required.
Do they ship to the Czech Republic?, because I want at least one of these! This is so cool!
I hope this become successful so that maybe somewhere in the future they could make a gaming laptop
As a computer shop owner:  This looks amazing!!!  Sure, some people will repair their own laptops now but, considering we still get desktops for repair, I don't feel threatened as a business AND I already love giving consumers the option to repair their own computers!  This is fantastic!
roasting dell and drop something i like those scene
the idea of coming back to the company for upgrades and customizations wb knock off customizations brought up by various other companies wud there be a decrease in sales for the company same like how when Apple brought up Air Tag as a new thing, the next week there was many knockoffs of the cover of the Air Tag  so wud that be a problem?
Man, this device is awesome. I'm currently not in need of a new Laptop, but I'm looking forward that this concept and company survives to most likely buy on in the future.
Framwork website has suffered the internet hug of death.  Woops
I was going to buy a Lenovo Legion, but thanks to this video, I will spend my money on this laptop. Well done, for winning over a tech skeptic.
You crashed their site FYI lol guessing everyone went to check out the website
Aaand I think their website just got a hug of death from LTT.
i think the video crashed frame.work's website. it just directs me to maintenance.
I pray to god in 5 years this brand becomes big enough to try their hand at some more creative attachment modules or maybe motherboards
Alex who's probably excited too see this shit : yeah cry me a river linus 😂😂😂😂
I think we broke Framework’s site again
Put a laptop got slot that’s what it needs
Teamwork makes the framework.
This laptop has a real freaking smartphone-grade webcam that Linus has been asking for a while now. It is incredible tho!
I want one right now
Uh, I think we crashed the Framework website!
0 minutes in: Hmm, upgradeable screen?
I want one!
1:58 boysss......I think we missed that drop!! 😭😭😭
Haven't seen Linus this hyped in a long time
LINUS YOU KILLED THEIR WEBSITE, IT CRASHED
Framework, You achieved not only mine but also every 'Right to repair' supporters respect!
Yeah I am officially keeping an eye on these guys for EU accessibility (keyboard variants) and touch screens because I will need to upgrade my elderly surface one day soon and the combo of the battery off BIOS and the upgradeability sells it for me.
holy shit this is the best thing ever
You killed their website.
Why is Apple always the Low lambing fruit? 😢🥺. They don’t do many things right, I can’t justify them. But they aren’t the only one. And while most of us on this channel know that, always going for that Low longing fruit makes non-tech-savy people would pick on Apple without fairly critiquing other companies.
Love this
Disruptive and game changer, evry laptop manufacturers in the nesr future will copy this!! This is like elon musk tesla of laptops
The diy route allows you to get comfy with the innards early on. Definitely approved.
Linus drop things 8:18
Funny.. razer.. or these guys.. they just copied phoneblocks...
14:17 It's not even thinner! 😂
i want this !!! At first when i saw the thumbnail of upgradability i thought same old marketing shit and no real changes, but...... this looks real promising !! i hope they come to India as well 🤩
I hope this works out then I hope they work on other laptops styles like gaming laptops and offer even more upgrades to  there existing laptops
seems really useless to have a upgradeable laptop where you can only upgrade minor things like the ports, more if that comes at the expense of needing to have tis exact laptop a good laptop with already good ports, already good keyboard etc seems more reasonable
Pushed so much traffic to their website, that the website crashed...  GG Linus!
Zack from @jerryrigeverything  joined the chat
Hasn't Eurocom been making modular Laptops for, oh I dunno, years?
If I was going to get a thin and light for portability, and I didn't need the form factor of my Surface Pro 7, this would be my #1 choice. I'm sorry I don't get the chance to support this, but I hope so much that Framework succeeds long term. Despite the CPU being soldered, I have a feeling that they would offer upgraded motherboards in the future for people that want to upgrade CPUs. The possibilities are endless.
Did this video just crushed the framework site?
Did we bring their website down?
In the future, this will be what used ThinkPads are now
This seems like one of those really good projects that for some reason aren't heard of twice
To be honest, I'm constantly being distracted by that green thing hanging out from that drawer.  Linus! What is this bruh? 🥱
damn makes me wants this laptop right now even right after already buying one
whatever editor is responsible for 11:50 deserves a raise.
Their site is actually on maintenance now. I'm guessing a flood of LTT viewers jut clicked the link.
Cool hack, just skip ahead 20s when Linus starts with sponsor, it even skips intro😂😂
Heck yeah!
Hope this company will change the landscape of laptop industry and attract more competitors into this path. Otherwise it's just another form of monopoly only that the DIY type of users are satisfied (after all you can only buy the extensions from them, and what if they decide to think like Apple?).
I mean of the motherboard is swappable as products come out this is perfect never have to learn a new keyboard/trackpad layout, you can keep windows installs between upgrades, and with the hotswap storage people who boot with Linux as well can carry around their Linux install.
I think their site stopped
Now I want to see what Louis Rossmann thinks of this thing. Preferably after he dissect it. Kinda like what Bullzoid does for PCB components.
I think Linus broke framworks website.
Oh sh*t is this nice
This genuinely sounds like a laptop I'd love to buy even without the massive upgradability stuff
Wow this has the potential to revolutionise laptops, even for those not that are not particularrly technical. I only have a laptop through work, so I won't be buying unfortunately, but I really hope these guys do well.
Went to buy one and their site is struggling ahahaha. Oh well. Im def getting one.
finally!
I need this laptop
Yes..  but does it game?
Isn't it a bit early talking about upgradability? You have shows replacable part but when or if there are going to be actual upgrades we'll only see in a few years but not now.
Congrats Linus, Not even half an hour, and the Framework homepage is already overloaded.
The DeLorean of Laptops. Is there one with a flux capacitor?
I learned about this from iFixit's channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV2umY3R0vw
how much
Wait... the charger is modular... and is USB C... you could use a Volta cable and BAM! Mag safe and no legal problems.  Yes you could do that on any USB C laptop...
Reminds me of repairing an old Thinkpad myself. Haven't seen that kind user accessibility since. Hopefully this will be a big wakeup call for other companies to follow.
2010s Sony VAIO and Japanese laptops in general were reasonably thin for the time but repairable same time. We need to teach businesses ethics they used to have
linus drop tips
I'm calling it, this is way too good to be not bought by Microsoft.
We should never let them fail.
Anybody elses anxiety levels rise everytime Linus was holding the laptop and moving it around? Other than that i'm looking into this laptop
Honestly I love the concept. I miss when older laptops were fully upgradeable and don't understand what happened since then.
Looks like the video caused enough traffic to take the site down. I'm happy for these guys, this product looks awesome.
omg linus almost dropped the laptop 🙃
I am thinking about buying laptop for some time now, but i have not find one i am happy with. I will probably buy this laptop.
I'm sold on the anime keyboard
Well, their websites down now with all of us trying to buy one. Good for them. Really gives me hope seeing that there is demand for something like that.
I think you did just "/.ed" started them, to use an old term, their website is down for maintenance 28 minutes after you put up this video.
I would nickname this laptop, The iFixit Killer.
1,101st
Framework Site down 😁 have to wait to order mine
dbrand needs to immediatly get in there to make official bezzles and keyboards with whatever designs
Yay, unexpected ddos atack on framework
Their site may have a good framework, but nothing protects from the hug of death.  As of writing, 18 minute video published 38mins ago, so the site was hugged within less than 20 mins assuming most watched the majority of the video before/while checking it out... that's actually kinda impressive.
this is a gut punched to does manufacturer who's against right to repair
After watching: Man that first statement in the video is so true!
Too bad I don't need a new laptop anytime soon.
Wow, I am blown away with how well repair incorporated into design is so beautiful. This is very refreshing
I love this thing so far, when are we getting the full review?
apple most of them all and the rest they don't want cause if not how they can announce every new imac  or laptops and see this is even better when in reality probably is the same but he got a laser that can shoot people or some other bullshit to make more money than before instead of making money and have some judgment for the environment, with this we increase e-waste and all we know the rest.
what a great machine, would totally evaluate to buy one!
Wow, their site got slashdot'd.  (Ask your parents)
Alternate Title: Linus having a techgasm for 18 min 45 secs (including sponsor segments)
Aaaaaaand frame.work crashes.
If it was bigger and would have better cpu and gpu options, i would love it. This way it's just a bit too slow for me despite their beautiful philosophy.
I wonder if it’s compatible with Linux. Some laptops have weird drivers that make them finicky with most Linux distros
Thanks Linus, you crashed their website...
If i ever need laptop, this will be the only one that i would even plan to buy
@16:16 - I think you might be misunderstanding Battery Disconnect. That feature usually disables the internal battery, in preparation for opening and servicing the machine. Upon next AC power connection, the battery will be reconnected.
What's the price?
I think he ddosed the frame work website with this video...
I think it's SUPER COOL. But at the end, when you said that they're counting on people coming back to them for upgrade parts - I don't think I'd upgrade it with new accessories/ports all that often. If a new CPU/MOBO comes out, and it fits right in the same footprint, maybe?
Come on people. Let’s buy some laptops!!!
Linus broke the Frame Work website.....
inb4 apple or dell or whoever attempt to destroy Framework
I wonder that instead of perfect finish on the lid, what if they use the covers like dbrand. Like user can design the top lid & the sticker company will send it to the customer or the company itself can print it with the sticker company partnership.
only if we had the right to repair...
So that's like a 2015 laptop design from the upgradability point, minus "IO module" (which is an issue for like 0.1% of user ?) with "modern" specs, not really impressive to be honest.  I mean like okay it's upgradable, it's neat for people who might need more storage in the future or to replace the ram (although who would need more than 16GB for a poor 4c/8t cpu ?) but the cpu is still not upgradable (not their fault) and it doesn't seems a drop in replacement motherboard (or better : BGA upgrade service) will ever exist. That's still a "soon to be e-waste" product like other laptop :/
Open source laptop lmao
I’m probably going to get it for my mother on Mother’s Day.
This is how all laptops should be
Well we killed their website :(
This is amazing, hope something at least close to this will eventually become the standard.
You just DDOS'd their page xD
It's possible their website crashed from traffic after this video was published cause it isn't responding
Hope they would continue to do the amazing job and not to lose along the way
If only it had coreboot it would be perfect.
I love modular stuff you think modern computer science would get it by now that's what made Star Trek so great modular electronics being able to swap stuff in and out so clean
I love the dark themed intro!!
But will people buy it?
I think we DDOSed framework website
Their website is actually down right now :D
OMFG!!! ME WANT THIS NOW!!  HOPE THEY COULD SHIP IT TO ASIA!!
WELP, we crashed (DDoS'd) the site... I actually want one now. (If it's not incredibly expensive)
You know Linus truely likes something when he acts like this
So many people went on the website that it crashed Linus…
I think we crashed their website lol normally I'm not watching the video so soon to launch so this is a first for me lol
And....We crashed their website!
Oh noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!
Imaging a replaceable motherboard for it, kinda like how intel swaps sockets every couple generations, you make a motherboard purchasable and upgradable as well
When he said "your idiot hands couldn't repair it"  Apple genius bar employees felt that
I think this video caused their site to go down lol.
I wish they made gaming laptops :(
Every proprietary laptop company should take some notes from this! This is the future! Period! 😔
And their website is slow as a turtle now. 😅
That laptop looks really good. Definitely worth a deeper look when my current laptop needs replacing.
I need a full review!
Linus would like Louis Rossmann and his views
I doubt that this will ever take off and be an actual competitor, but it would be cool to see
I'm not really a fan of laptops but I kinda want to order as well. lol
I think Linus crashed the site. lol
LTT video drops... https://frame.work struggles to handle to load LTT subscribers put on it! lol
this is actually impressive
It would seem like their website is getting a smothering love hug from the community
Imagine if Apple took the philosophical leap to take this approach and gradually move most of the hardware they design to this model - they would win over so many new customers and actually make a huge contribution to their environmental goals.
Their website has been crashed xP probably due to this video hahaha
It seems that they might create a new form factor of laptop mothetboards as well as mini pc.
you are late to upload linus, some asian guy already made a video
Lmao their website is overloaded and theyre upgrading. protip use cloudfront
This makes me wish I were in the market for a laptop right now. I really hope this sort of thing becomes the standard...
I immediately wanted to invest if that's possible.
My Dream laptop
26 minutes after this video airs, the framework website is down for maintenance. I guess I wasn't the only one interested in this thing.
Man what a great company
Now they need to do this with an All-In-One.
This is awesome.  I want one.
I see this laptop as something built by engineers for engineers, I held on my 2010 laptop for 11 years solely for the wacky third part battery I have in it the third part keyboard I use and love the upgradable memory the upgradable CPU. I think it's about time I retire my old laptop for something that will serve me well for years on end
ThinkPad.
I hope they add support for drawing pens.
Ok now this sounds great. And really honest amazement from linus.. and me.. and probably everyone
This video crashed their site
All laptop manufacturer : this is forbidden jutsu 😡
when i need a new laptop i know what to buy now.
video is out 30 minutes and frameworks site is down. guess people like it
it would be great to have a dedicated graphics card like a gaming laptop with these features . if its comes with good options, cpu and graphics card upgradability , i would never consider other brands
GG!!! I don't care if I have a fat laptop as long as it got everything I need. Or can be upgraded with everything I need.  This serves that exact purpose and this ain't even a thick laptop. It seems to be fairly thin. Sweet! And now I want one... And my wallet doesn't agree 🤣🤣  Edit:.  Omg those keys with transparent keycaps are so cool. Here's a thought: imagine if there was tiny LCD displays in them (like the ones on elgato streamdeck buttons). It may be a little expencive though 😳
and it seems that we have broken their website... not even surprised haha
Hug of death review 😂 website already crashed! Will definitely be checking it out later when their website is back up
love watching Linus geek out about things
I was somewhat considering buying a laptop. This has convinced me to
Man, you just know this was built by mega enthusiasts. It's on another level. Let's hope it can actually stay profitable and sustainable for a long time. There were ideas and prototypes for modular devices before, but they all failed unfortunately.
And now their site is crippled. WTG LMG. 😂
intresting 4sure
Their Website is down lo everybody is checking XD
Imagine what a Dbrand collaboration could be like. Custom bezels and keyboards?  This is a really cool product that I am definitely interested in!
Y’all crashed their website lmao. I really do hope the best for every single framework employee, GOAT.
Laptop Users: “let’s turn this laptop keyboard into a membrane keyboard lol.”
I can imagine tech enthusiasts being happy after a long time
I thought that the laptop webcam came out looking exceptional. The transparency from the company on the components that are actually used in the hardware and expected performance is great. I also appreciate the ability to easily slot in new hardware / ports so simply as well as the little features like hardware disconnect switches and unattended driver installs.
Their website it down right now, I wonder why
I think their website got overloaded :)
the website from framework went offline for "maintenance", but im pretty sure they just cant handle all the orders they are getting after this video :P
i think the release of this video just broke their website xD
I don't need my devices to be paper thin to the extreme of breaking up if I look at them the wrong way, I need some heft to my stuff, with them being repairable and upgradeable a big yes to me
This is so fantastic. I really want to support them
I want!
Frame works site is crashed after this released.
you guys crashed the site.... ;D, do you guys know if they ship to the EU?
Framework site crashed after this video... I went to check the page... Lol
Silly Linus...  You didn't buy this segway to your sponsor.. Your sponsor obviously bought it to you..
We crash there servers I think it is not loading
frame.work died after the video
"everything is upgradable" yeah except the two main things the cpu and gpu
Rip website lol, it got hugged to death.
hopefully they might have some sort of replacement/upgrade deal for swapping mobo's with newer/more powerful cpu's in the future too and perhaps reselling the refurbished ones sent back to new customers? just a thought.  *edit*  looks like they thought of replacing the main board already, neat
The framework website has been hugged to death
Linus crashing yet another company's website lol
This. is. so. AWEOSME!
Lol I think you crashed their site.... just tried going qnd can't get through
i think the traffic from this video is crashing their site rn lol
11:36 was that intel 😂
They haven't opened up orders in my region yet, but I've signed up for their monthly updates cuz I wanna get one when it comes out
Linus is a weeb confirmed 17:35
this is dope and how I want my laptop to be from now on. as upgradeable as a desktop in a way to the point you could replace anything.
I have those magnetic USB C connectors, they're supposedly 3.2 rated, and pretty nice. They also sit close to the port, so there isn't too much flex and strain on it. I want to say the brand is RedBean all metal, not terribly expensive, but $20 for one.
i'd buy if it had a good ryzen apu.
People are really sold on this we killed their website once this video dropped lol
FINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALY, bloody hell that's way fucking overdue.
Hey Louis Rossmann talked about this company a while back and he talked about it again recently. Good to hear that LTT are actually geniunly pro RTR. Love you guys.
Been watching videos from 2017 and 2018 and this pops up. Ahh new one, will do.
Big Tech companies should take notice of this product.... Glad to finally see a company do a modular laptop. Something consumers want.
Did the demand of people coming from the LTT vid just crash there site? Think they are goin to be happy with demand.
Seems people are interested the website keeps going down
Linus' Because of you Framework website just overloaded :D
Noo i want thisss asap
lol we crashed the site
Imagine gaming laptops with this many components upgradability. It would put the average 4-5 year lifespan to probably doubling it, if the company are willing to support it that long.
I'm just made my pre order thing I CAN'T WAIT in 5 years when I want a fucking super damn pro connect port or whatever the fuck it's called then
I think one argument of not doing this thing is because if someone broke the device, when trying to upgrade/repair it, the company can get sued, especially in the US.
I like this laptop! Might order it if its ships globally
I've waited soooooo long for LMG to do a video on this😭
I wish I had the money to just go buy one to support this, here to me wishing the company thrives! ❤️ Thanks for being awesome, loved the Linus got ordered his too, freaking awesome!
I would love to see an ortholinear keyboard option. I know it would probably be super niche tho :(
I want this
Was badly  waiting for linus to cover this
Wow, it's almost like a better product can be made for the consumer when there isn't one/ a few greedy assholes at the top who's only priority is to make as many millions for themselves as possible.
They need to accept donations, I don’t need a laptop now but would kick in some cash out of respect. Or sell stickers etc
Immediately went to buy one and they’re website seems to be a bit overloaded right now lol
How'd they fix that 1080p webcam but these others can
1:56 "oh yes, Linus isn't actually a paid actor, he's actually extremely clumsy "
If I were in the laptop market, I would be sold. I am interested in the motherboard cost. Like if I want to upgrade my CPU, how much would that cost? Also, will there be a version with a GPU?
Unfortunately their website is a not loading crap :/
This is Awesome, Love to see more videos with this, especially the Benchmarks!
9:29 he didn't make the antenna cable match with the color coded arrows on the sticker 😡 (I don't think it technically matters but muh color matching)
lmfao the website immediately goes down because so many people now want to get one
Htc in the town...
framework is getting it
The I/O seems a bit limited compared to my gaming laptop that has 8 connections. But this thing is still really cool!
I think Linus made the framework website crash
Cara mais perna de pau que ja vi.. ele quebra tudo que toca..
wow
Looks like their website just got hugged to death lol. I hope they sell millions of these things.
Their site is broken thanks Linus.
That was the most positive review of a product I can recall from LMG.
Their website went offline XD it´s seems this video got them many visits
your viewers crashed the website lol
Linus just ddos'd frame.work with a video
the website is "under maintenance" right now, thinking that LTT maybe accidentally Ddos them by making this video
What all the engineers want to build but can't.
You can buy usb c cables, that have a detachable magnetic head on them. You keep it plugged in the laptop at all time and just replace the built-in cable on the power brick for the magnetic cable. I own a few from "JianHan" on Amazon, charges my phone, Quest 2 and more with them.
I think we crashed their website lol
This endorsement by Linus is more valuable than any paid ad ever could be. I've never seen Linus more excited about a laptop. They did good with this one. I just wish it had a GPU
Linus crashed the framework website
Ordering one with his own money, is there higher praise?
Where do I sign my butt to this company?
This laptop has the best webcam i have seen till date ,,, damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Daym I wish I had one of those, maybe I'd get one after a while
well.. that is not gonna have any parts anymore in 2 years. displayport is awesome though and that you can change your ports is a gamechanger
Linus tech tips! You did it again 🦾🦾🦾
You almost killed their website with this video, goes to show how much people value a product like this. I'm not in the US/CA so I will have to wait, but 100% interested in getting one for myself.
I am 100% sold also.
How hard is it to do Linux on this thing? Linux may not like the swapping bits out as much and doing terminal bs might get annoying. Could y'all make a video on this please.
Idk why people generally think that the average person isn't intelligent enough to do anything. What disprouved it for me was the climate group created by the French government, comprised of random French citizens that were rightfully informed. The president and his government expected them to fail and take bogus decisions, but they took sound and very informed decisions because they had good information given to them, every company should sell products like this !
I think you guys just crashed their website lol!
Really hope this catches on
Mmmm yes the anti John deere laptop
Linus made their website go down :D
Modular? Yes. Repairable? Yes. "COMPLETELY Upgradable"? Not yet, let's see if they will actually deliver their "upgradable motherboard" promise, otherwise it's pretty much the same as any laptop that's not super slim.
Buying it because of the Hardware Vid and Mic Switch. ABOUT TIME. Every Laptop needs these. Standard!
This is awesome
Louis rossman would love this
RIP Frame Works website...
"There is some flex" Dude, I have never seen a Laptop flex so hard.
1:42 ngl had me for a sec there, Linus
Their website is down because of traffic 🤣😂🤣
I want one, i just hope german keyboard layout will come soon.
Great vid but need more talk about general pricing of stuff
imagine if Linus dropped that 😂
Plus you can avoid the Windows tax!  If you don't need a Windows license, you can configure without one! (Which isn't just for Linux or BSD users, but also anyone who already owns a spare Windows license). This is a pretty expensive machine nonetheless, but man is it good not to get charged for shit I didn't even want in the first place.
Their website just down 😂 maybe too much traffic suddenly
I wish they made this laptop but made of apple like aluminum
A laptop that is actually designed by SENSIBLE ENGINEERS!
Linus just buying one during the review is the best endorsement I have seen for a laptop on this channel.
Holy shit that webcam looks awesome
This laptop actually got me excited for laptops again
I think this video crashed framework's servers lol. I just went to check them out and the site is down. Linux may have accidentally DDOS'd them
so we dooing lodout laptops now whith different attachmets
Never saw Linus very happy like today very positive video
Perfectly upgradeable as everything should be...
WTF THAT LAPTOP CAMERA IS SO F***ING GOOD I WANT IT
y he so mad
Good job everyone you just blew up Frameworks website.
This pleases me.
god I hope they can make it and not kinda fade away like a bunch of startup LTT has featured over the years
I don't think I can recall the last time Linus gave such a ringing endorsement like this before. Especially to the extreme of ordering his own while still filming.
the site crashed. The power of Linus
The Webcam is even better than the crappy $3k macbook pro. Mind blowing 🤯
Looking forward for a discrete GPU version.
Their website is now actually down, because of this video 😂 Nice to see that so many people like the idea
If they could get 2 USB c in a module it would be perfect
They got me sold.
Wasnt any laptop used to ????
I wish that enough people buy this product so that laptops like this stay in existence. I don’t want to see this as a failure of a brilliant idea cos people didn’t buy it.
Did you not show off one hell uf a modular laptop about 1 year ago? 🙈
Finally a thin and light that got me intrested
When u start regretting ur recent purchase because of this video
How much. For the cooling fan
you didn't bye the sponsor you were sold to
But can it run windows 11
You crashed the website HAHA
And no matter how upgradable it is, a desktop pc two times cheaper would perform better
What's the base model price?
I'm not in the market for a laptop rn but I totally buy one of these if they run with it
dangit, I need one
i would buy it. i am sold
Aaaand frameworks website is down. Congrats! :D
Welp I'm sold.
Did we just ddos'ed their website? 👀
You broke framework's website
lol. their Website is down xD
Haha xD this killed the framework website xD thanks Linus
fell in love with that company
Linus Crashed their website "Maintenance Framework is undergoing maintenance right now.  Please check back in a few minutes." to much traffic after this video ;)
This is cool because you can tell Linus is genuinely excited to review it
Linus giving a good review on a new technology with little to no downsides: The website: God have mercy
*Louis Rossmann liked that*
Bruh, this is like DREAM LAPTOP territory.
"DELL" xDDDDDDDDD 11:34
I really really want this to go places, this is looking to solve my only big problem with laptops
Try it with eGPU using the thunderbolt port included.
why is linus being a karen today ?
Never has been more appropriate to say, "This is the way".
This looks like a dream come true 👌
watching this on my lenovo craptop, it bends just as much as the framework one does, manufacturers no longer have excuses
Literally only 2 freakin' companies exist today (fairphone and framework) that actually take right to repair seriously and care for the environment.
Everyone is going to the website so much and now the site is broken
Annnnd the website is down.
Rejoice fellow nerds, for their website has pooped itself through our valiant efforts
they could make it double thicc, stack 2 those module per slot, upgraded battery and beefier cooler and its would be acceptable
There's too many people going to check it out and the site is down lmao.
It won't be long before big tech companies will try to cause some kind of hindrance for them
You finally added the dividing lines for the video to know each part and SKIP THE ADD LIKE A PRO!! LES GO!! !! thank you!! I LOVE YOU!!
this is a product that i could see myself buying honestly
Me who remembers that razer concept being recent Linus: WAAAAAAY BACK wow ok.
Stupid company, they definitely should learn from the most successful business company Apple, they can sell 200$ Apple branding 8G memory by  designing their laptop in a right way. They should hire a MBA to run this company instead of engineers.
When you stop giving a shit about money and actually think of how buyers would want it, you get a great product.
It like legos
I'm in love with this laptop!
This makes me feel hopeful again… getting tired of big tech’s practices 😤
pls don't Linus 6:05
we should standardize laptop motherboards and laptop chassis, along with being able to buy a gpu chip and cpu chip
Went to look at the website, annnnd it's down
Hompage is down... I am gonna order asap.... AND leave 100$ Tip
wow, this is the highest recommendation he could possibly give
Holy fuck, my ThinkPads might have a replacement!
The only upgradeable components that make sense are ram and ssd. Change my mind.
LTT Media Group could partner with them and manufacture stuff like the bezels or a magnetic charging port with their tooshop . .
Their poor website can’t handle all the traffic rn
Practicality of the modules aside, the  ins design is very beautiful from a designer and engineering perspective, I hope this really has a future
Is this sponsored??
LOL the website is down
To be honest I would rather have this modular laptop with that one fan and 2 heatpipes than some other one with 2 fans and 5-6 heatpipes
Lol, gj team Linus, we took down their site.
I like this laptop, let's take a look at the price now...hopefully its affordable at all...  EDIT1: apparently their site is so full that its almost DDOSed...I guess they might not be in stock for long o_o  EDIT2: it was indeed DDOSed due to massive amounts of customers xD  EDIT3:750$, not bad, not bad at all.
If they make one with trackpoint, 3 buttons and based on AMD I'm 90% in. :D
Goes to look at the site:   "Framework is undergoing maintenance right now. Please check back in a few minutes."   oh, the video only just released, of course we'd crash the website
Honestly, I want one
Framework NEEDS to stay in business… their business practice, transparency and thoughtful design is so refreshing. If they ever went public for investing, I’d be a day 1 investor.
Is the BIOS COREBOOT or they have a COREBOOT option - able to run Chrome OS and disconnect spy hardware, as PSP and Intel ME https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNwWQ9zGT-8
waiting for the chef's kiss
Now we just pray for the company to get bigger and better and more people sport them
Geez he's really caking it on for this one done sold his soul to the devil old Papa making that money next video will be I'm gonna buy 20 RTX thirty 90s and I'm gonna burn him in a fire and see how long it takes two thumbs up Tucker are you fans of mine
I am 100 percent gonna buy one if it's available in India 🇮🇳
This is an actually exciting product. I need a new laptop anyway
Spoiler alert: he didn't game on it
lol we crashed their website
The LMG effect is real, the Framework website seems to be down due to excess traffic.
Ok, finally a laptop that I'm willing to buy, and, I know you don't care but whatever, the last laptop I bought was a Toshiba, it came with an AMD K6 II processors, yeah, windows 98. This is a really good product and I hope it gets to fly high.
You just killed their website: frame.work does not respond. Way to go Linus :D Edit: went into maintenance mode xD
This video just made their site to go to maintenance
Oh boy, I think I need one of those right now
Damn their site has been down ever since the video was made public lol
THIS is what innovation looks like! Fuck, I'm so happy to finally see a laptop for normal humans.
The framework website is under mantenious
GPU modules are obviously the dream for this. I'd imagine it would require  Thunderbolt, though heat would still be an issue without a fan or some very special engineering
If, if this laptop in future will get upgradable mobile gous and cpus, bruh I'm buying one ASAP
I don't see a lot of new things here, almost all laptops with this size can be disassembled, only the thinner options have some soldered components. It will be interesting if we already know that this brand survive for several years and would make newer components (like the mainboard). For now this is just a common laptop without any options for the parts that we cannot replace on others laptop (like the screen, the webcam, the mainboard, the keyboard...) And even if the specs are ok, we don't know how bad or good is the screen, how efficient is the cooling solution, how long can it run on a single charge...
yeah, the laptop skins would be profitable
I wish all the laptops are like this
Tried to visit the website to check it out. Looks like LTT's YouTube community is giving it the Hug of Death lol
The website is going down guys
Yes yes yess. A million times yes for the industry to go in this direction.
This is a fantastic idea.
15:00 To be fair he had to do lots of sacrefices when upgrading for 5k$…^^
Really cool
frameworks site is down, think linus may have inadvertantly caused a server overload haha
How much is it?
That keyboard at the start is the spawn of 2000’s
Why would Apple educate its users? They're gonna lose money if they did that.
We crashed their site. Ill buy when it opens again
There's an old saying. An engineer will climb over a mountain of virgins to fk a mechanic (or in this case I guess technician?) But these guys are breaking the chain.
When you say "Most laptops have upgradeablke wireless" - one of the things which has been a constant gripe with my partner's laptop is the fact that Sony locked down which modules will work in there, so I don't have confidence that an upgrade would work at all!
lol, the framework website went down......is it from us? ooooops
This but ryzen plz
50784tg
did we crash their site?
Bloody hell I want one.  Edit: Assuming, from their pages slow load times and lagging, I am not only one interested after watching this video.
that's great!!!
Sure, the CPU isn't upgradeable... but I don't see why they can't sell cpu+motherboard upgrades, you'd just pop the old one out and pop the old modules onto the new one  They could offer rebates if you send in the old mobo so they can recycle/refurbish
11:53 who tf edited that lmao
hey linus, if you're buying your segues, rather than selling them, you're doing something wrong.
An open 3rd party aftermarket like what Glock pistols and AR-15 rifles now are having is the key to make Framework survive.
We did it guys their website is down
OAnother good thing they could do is that the piece with the cpu is replaceable  and you can buy one with a better cpu and swap it with the old one
This is awesome. I happily have never had a laptop since I started buying my own computers. This teams work has managed to make me genuinely want a laptop again.
Went to check the website out and we crashed the site lmao.
When will we get a CPU and GPU swappable Laptop?
I just went to frameworks site after the video, and their servers must be getting hit hard, because it couldn't even load lol. It shows how many people are actually interested in a product like this. I look forward to seeing more manufacturers take this kind of approach.
Please buy this laptop guys , this is the only way to support them and change things around!
Site is down at the moment. Maybe many people went there after watching this? :)
Either the site is truly under maintenance or we just dropped the site down 😂
Seems like this video may have given their website the hug of death.
My hp pavilion has a display issue when service personnel examined he just tore of the display screen from the chassis and he tells me that these are just stuck with sir. PS hp hasnt even replaced my faulty display part as the case have been booked on 26 April/21 and it has been escalated to top priority many times and still havent got my screen replaced all of it is under warranty .Pathetic customer service response and poor service personnel response. Those service personnel doesnt even attend any of calls after bugging him more than 3 times he says its on the process sir pls wait i will have to conform it with hp . Final : dont buy Hp products 🙏
The frame work website is straining under the load of viewers XD
Aaaaand the website is down LOL
Wooow! the website it's down and it has been just 16 mins since the release of the video 😎, that just show its a very amazing product and hopefully my next laptop
This was lit
dumb.  just get USB-C cables for everything you have and use one port.  The adapter is a bottle neck with speeds as you clearly show...USB-C 3.2 compliance is so much faster than that.  this is a trash product.
dad?
Dude i am sold!! normaly im a pc user but for school or whatever YES.
The mic switch already is enough for me to order one
you know, iam not that typical Notebook-Guy, if you would call that so.....but holy Crap, is that sexy....you can strip that thing like you are building a PC from scratch.....that is one damn fine thing they made, and if i would buy a laptop, then this *thumbs up*
Great job Linus. You broke their webserver. *please note sarcasm*
I think we all just crashed the Framework website
If it comes with Ryzen APU and LTE/5G expension, I'll buy it.
Frame works website is getting the hug of death right now.
Multibillion dollar company: we can't make this upgradeable and functional Some dudes in a garage in a year and a half: hold my ThinkPad
i actually want one
I want to see a thicker one, aimed at a level deeper of repairability and modularity- with lga & pga processors. +10 if they add support for older mobile non-bga processors too on the side, to help reduce e-waste of processors that are still, frankly, still good.
Damn, haven't seen linus love a product this much in a while.
imagine forgetting your usb C chip at home
So your telling me this thing is built well, runs well, isn't rediculously over priced and upgradable ..... Finally a company who can set an example to apple on environmental friendliness.
This is so great! Just get a model with ryzen and dedicated, upgradable graphics
The youtube hug right now for the Framework page.
so many good design choices and a lack of plastic in packaging. Hope they survive and make a much bigger range of motherboards and thus chips amd ryzen, screen, speakers and camera. be interesting if they will still be around and doing well in 3 or so years when the current laptop will probably be getting a bit worse for wear.
ethernet build in?
framework website has crashed
It'd be cool if they eventually make motherboard upgrades so I could upgrade from Intel to RISC-V.
Id buy it. I want this or a librem or starlabs
Let's sell you a laptop which hurts are profit margin because you don't need to buy a whole new laptop.
Their website got swamped.
At least the should let people change the ram and the m.2 ssd in all the laptops, i'm not looking at you apple, well yes i actually am
ordering one rn. we are hugging the site so much its down! :D
BUY THESE LAPTOPS THESE COMPANIES DESERVE MORE
Framework's website is "down for maintenance" !!! That poor server haha
Where is Louis Rossman??
If only they had option for desktop APUs from AMD and Intel. That would be sick!
Can I install MacOS?
I hope they don't go bankrupt like previous attempts at modular/repairable smartphones.
I don't need it... I dOn'T nEeD iT...       I NEEED ITTT
bump
Finally!!!
11:54
lol, this video crashed their website.
Linus showing modular laptop, few minutes later their website is down. PEOPLE WANT THIS!!!
Beautiful and Mac Book isn't something that could be in one snetence 😂🤮 Garbage
linus sent so many of us to the website that it crashed!!!
I am going to buy one and assemble it myself.... am poor aprentice but that thing is just the ultimate thing.
it's not everyday I see a perfect product
Linus broken phone: "Do I mean nothing to you?!"
Darn it site down for maintenance lol
LTT ddosed the site with their glowing praise lol
Aaaaaaand the framework website just crashed
Dreams do come true
You crashed their site
this! this needs to catch up and be a standard!
Well the site went down, I think this video pushed a ton of traffic to it, and they deserve all the attention!
You have my full attention. This company needs some support.
Im sorry im not seeing anything innovative over here. Modular IO was on most laptops on the 2000's and nobody cared too much. And if you want to replace any other component, you have to do it the same old fashion way by unscrewing / screwing delicate components straight to the board. Only thing different is that you have QR codes for tutorials and colored screws. That's a nice idea, but it's just a regular old fashion laptop. And how is the warranty enforced? If anyone is invited to screw open his laptop and plug / unplug delicate components like there legos, How can the company tell the difference from real product defect and user errors? (BTW these components were never made to be swapped like this, They are bare PCBs that can be shorted and damaged easily by being handled unprofessionally). I can go on, but Linus has missed many cons in this video unfortunately...
Well now I know what my next laptop will be
This may actually be my next laptop. This is very nice to see!
so many people went to the site i think it crashed lol this is a cool ideal i am down to get one as well
And how much will it cost .
Now make a thinkpad x1 carbon style device out of it. I need that trackpoint&all of that good stuff
I want one. Not because i need it, i just want this to succeed
Linus, if YOU bought the segue into the sponsor, I think something is wrong!
I'm sold. This has the top spot in my consideration set and I will mention it to everyone searching for a laptop.
Is everyone watching this video visiting their website...cause it's lagging 😂😂
Their website is already annihilated from the exposure of this video lol. Excited to check it out later though
I was looking for a laptop for university, guess I found it
We probably overloaded their site.
The modular design of the fair phone is so good. Me an my family would have had to throw the phone away so many years earlier if we couldn't order a new speaker
when we get to swap a gpu, then we might be talking
MAGNETS, FREAKING MAGNETS
Framework here!  Happy to answer any questions folks have on the product.
Finally, something in the laptop space that's worth it.
Only if they can just make it with ARM based CPU and I would buy it right away.
No joke I'm looking into getting one of these.
there should be a laptop motherboard standard
Genius
Are the expansion modules supported on smartphones as well??
*Project Ara flashbacks*
If I didn't just buy a new laptop 2 months ago, I would definitely have bought this one
website is down lol people trying to order
the charger-evil girlfriend comment killed me!!! XD
Damn honestly what a product, I genuinely believed it wasn't possible to get a good user experience, price and build to go along with modularity within laptops. Framework proved me wrong im very interested :)
All this video is omg USB type c omg USB type c omg USB type c lol
Website down. Did we hug them to death?
11:50 is probably the hardest ive laughed in a while lmao
Please Review Zotac Magnus One range of mini PCs! It has Desktop Graphics Card and Processor and laptop Ram.
that is suck a good laptop
their website is getting squeezed by LTT fans lol. \
Linus almost went full WingsOfRedemption when Alex said “Cry me a river, Linus” 🤣
And another idea bites the dust ;) but pretty well done to me!
doodadamajigs is my new favorite word
Is it just me or framework website isn't working? Did LTT viewers got the website to crash? (Even if it's not fun it's kind of a good thing...)
I think LTT already crashed their site lol.
I don't know what to comment   ...  Other guy - then don't comment
HP 2 months later: WE HAVE A CUSTOMISABLE LAPTOP GUYS COME BUY IT!
This video single handedly gave Frameworks site the hug of death.
I'm glad to see a product like this on the market. My coworkers are gonna be hella impressed when they ask if I have the right port avaliable and I start switching them out to match the needed port.
This video brought down the frame.work website. I hope you're proud of yourselves.
Linus literally crashed their site
oh no please don't hug the site to death, I wanna check pricing you guys D:
Y'all just crashed Framework's site.... *clap*
This is exactly what we need! And the fingerprint sensor supporting Linux drivers is awesome. Shows that they care about everyone. Guys, we need to support them.
My next laptop ✅
Not to knock the amazing work they’re doing, but a standardized form factor for laptop mobos might do the same trick. It allows for 3rd parties to fill any gaps left by the manufacturer for needed features.
Actually a really good laptop  Good job Framework <3
I thought you slashdotted the framework website, but it turns out it's been unreachable for over a week according to is it down right now.
Framework just got the best endorsement they could ever ask for. That too for free.
🤔 but the batter question will be. Can we play games in it
You could squeeze in a bigger battery... or you could've gone Ryzen and got more power-efficiency that way :/
The backwards hat and beard look makes Linus look less nerdy than usual
thanks for putting the cut to the intro's now, also YOU bought the ad spot for Gskill? thats awfully generous of you as normally sponsered ads are paid for by them.
Love this idea and setup. Hope it gets real traction and maybe some higher end hardware like integrated Nvidia and such.
I want to buy this just because I support this idea so much and want to see more
If those expansion cards interface using USB C 3.2, do you really need the USB C ones, can you just plug your USB C cable into the expansion port without the dongle.
My question is whether I can get a GPU, even a low powered one, at some point.
Maaan We need to support this company and make it like a trend Please buy this laptop guys , this is the only way to change things around!  So it can go on and live longer And actually makes the other big companies create laptops that are more upgradable!
At last! The laptop I've been searching for since 2010!!!
Hot damn. I wish this will come available in Europe. Honestly we need laws to enforce this kind of design by standard to reduce e-waste and planned obsolescence.
Yo
Lost all respect for Apple when they said their consumers are to stupid to replace a battery.
Take any Dell. Happy user of one ... repair manual and easy to replace part out of the factory (You can download repair manual no fees from Dell website) Plenty spare parts (from Dell and third parties) plus factory and third party batteries the most crucial component (I got through mine in 2.5 years and replace with compatible one myself it was not hard to remove screws from bottom remove the bottom (no glue) unscrew the battery and all it is done by using 1 screw driver in 20 minutes (not it technician myself)) as well I replace DC plug because broke one again a couple of screws and you are done ... See no point in this laptop, just buy Dell without additional services ;) Possible usage of existing Dell (7000 2 in 1 series with i7) will be another 2-3 years and then last battery replace and this pc will go to reserve for emergency cases.
dude did we crash the website?? xD hahah
wish this woulda came out before I bought my brand new laptop lol
Yep, that thing looks awesome
It’s cool… will not sell
*Activate Windows
A laptop that's kicks ass of HP DEll Apple etc.
I think this video caused a DDOS to the Framework website
10/10 👍 on iFixit.
Dell is getting friggin destroyed lately between you and Steve haha
The elegant vegetarian canonically bump because morning adventitiously provide anenst a uninterested prison. hot huge, earsplitting prison
If they can find a way to do it with AMD. I’m sold.
I'm waiting for this to become standard!
Yes, more of this!
Linus what did you do... Their website is down
their website is dead, linus, you killed it
Build-a-Laptop:
Neat
This seems really interesting. My current dell G5 is pretty upgradable to, but this is some next level stuff. If I buy a new laptop in a few years I will surely consider them.
I really can't understand, what is their targeted audience?  People who like to tinker with their laptops they do anyway.  If People are going to make custom enclosure then, what's the point of using this motherboard. We can buy spare motherboard of powerful laptop and do the job.   I liked the keyboard swap and speakers swap, because those are hardest one to find or customize.
THE DELL"S NOT EVEN FUCKING THINNER! 🤣🤣🤣
I was wondering if/when LTT would take a look at these
The website won’t open hahahaha probably crashed from all the requests to it
Thanks, Linus!  You crashed their website!  haha
You just know that he dropped that thing in between shots
Really happy LTT covered this.
Framework: good job linus, now our website is down
I don't really have a use for or even need for a laptop, but this this is so good.  Even the idea of the mobo being replaceable, like the processors is out dated now? No probs, mobo swap and keep your existing display and modules?  Not to mention the fact that if more people get into this kind of scheme its going to save of e-waste....  If it's available in the UK and the price is as reasonable as they say it is I might just end off ordering one (but the site is currently down for maintenence)
Reminds me of the modular Smartphone... Didnt took of eighter ..
Proprietary modules that remember the pcie expansion cards and the LG G5 disaster? Why not?
2,000 likes, 527 comments, 1 excellent product, and yet they will sell *dozens* of these.
I've heard that the biggest negative for this laptop is heat management. It isn't as bad as a MacBook, but it can't get much better due to the restricted design of having the Motherboard have to stay the same size.
11:56  Linus out of context, bruh what did I just witness? You're welcome 🤷‍♂️
This video has caused their website to crash. I got on their website right when this uploaded and it crashed while configuring a laptop.
This video killed their site.
I really hope this succeeds. I'm tempted to buy one just to show support.
Oh man, the pain. The disrespect this guy has towards his audience is legendary. I can't blame him, If I would be as rich as him I wouldn't give a f toward those losers who watch this.
Activate Windows lmao
I know where I get my next laptop, and please make more mainboard options (Ryzen 3) available
man playing with lego, appreciated
This is the first time i saw Linus so hype over a upgradeable laptop
I am waiting for it in touch with ryzen, and it will be the most amazing piece of tech I'll ever buy. huge congrats.
You held the bowling ball wrong
This video crashed their website
I'm sure Dell doesn't share this kind of philosophy.
Wow Amazing😱😱😱
I think we hug of death'd their site lmao
nice
Pinned comment
We broke the framework website oops
This makes the other laptop makers look stupid.
Who still wants USB-A on a laptop?!
... this company better fucking take off
I still don't understand why the WIFI connectors need to connect to the WIFI chip directly rather then to where it is connecting so you never have to mess with disconnecting and reconnecting them when taking it out or putting it into a system.
11:54 I don't know why I found that funny but I can't help laughing every time I watch it
Panasonic gen 2
me who knows nothing about pc's yet watched ltt because it fun to watch linus
You know if you buy a coat or a shirt, even the $5 ones, it's customary to sew on an extra button. But extra screws in an electronic device? It's so obvious, yet so revolutionary.  Also, this is even better than Right to Repair, You don't need to fight for law when there is enough demand to create a supplier that can crush the proprietary competition.
11:35 What the hell is a financing company doing in a tech video?
Man, those modular, interchangeable bits of I/O...never even dared imagine something like that coming on a laptop platform. Imagine slotting them over, depending on what your daily plans are.
First 360, we're getting sloppy bois
Framework is undergoing maintenance
Soyjak Linus is cursed  11:55
What about gaming laptop like this 😎
Dammit linus you missed a that’s what she said moment
Pretty sure this video just crashed the Framework website lol
Website crashing because a company is offering what customers want, or scalpers.
The Franwork website take ages to load. Thanks Linus.......
U crashed the webiste. Should have given them a heads-up when you upload next time.
the 31 dislikes are from tim cook and apple board members
wait it can be both look at what pine64 does
Dude, this is amazing. I love it.
Inb4 Framework gets bought out by a Big Tech company. It happens every time someone makes something that is innovative
Tried to go visit their site, its under maintenance. Did we hug the frame.work site to death guys?
So those proprietary companies make things and scam us into buying that are of total bullshit .GOT IT
Framework's website just crashed
And ther website is virtully dead lol. Too good of advertisement I guess.
I am so excited for the community mods to this laptop.
If Steve Wozniak had led Apple, something like this would have come a decade or two earlier. Just saying...
That is impressive
Honestly! Why don‘t you make a LTT-Laptop with thee brand?
Everybody here loves the idea so much we crashed their website.
Holy shit! This is the first laptop I've ever been excited for. Ever!
The future is bright, thanks to Joe Biden enforcing right to repair:)
"big fat steam library".. but no GPU 😭
Linus addressing the concerns I was wondering about the product, why I still watch him 6 years later
Remind me of phoneblocks
their website is down now minutes after this LTT videa going live. Shows where LTT fans want to put their money :)
11:55 whoever edited this, give him a raise
Framework website crashed, rip!
lmao you guys crashed their website
I love when he said "I wanna invest". I don't think you could get better praise
is the website down?
This is brilliant! Tried to reach the website 10 minutes after this video upload, but it was instantly timed out xD
Wow, we got their website down
This thing is fantastic. I want it.
I really hope this company does well and stick to this type of design.
I just checked out the website to look at it and its down i think this video crashed the website
this is so f*cking cool damn
Yet it could never compete with the design of a MacBook. No Windows laptop ever will.
their website just crashed from so many ppl :D
I would watch a video of you building your own LTT case for the laptop.
1:56 Does it surprise you that Linus' phone is without a case and shattered? Guess not :D
No modular gpu/cpu upgrade path? :(
just went to the framework site and it was under maintenance, hopefully, it is because they got soo much traffic. I really think that I am gonna buy it.
Hey Linus!! I am in need of graphics card or a new rig can you give away it to me please?
The editing at 11:55 is top notch
Website Down LOL
#akgNotificationSquad
Who crashed the site?
Reminds me of Project ARA.... Hoping this laptop survives what ARA could not.
I wish it had a GPU
14 minute gang btw
The best endorsement of a product: Damn, I'm buying one! I know they sent one over but instead of just using that, I'm going to buy my own cus it's just *that* good!
the website crashed LOL
I'm going to say something Negative about this product (gasp D:). While this full modular device is really appealing for those who want to customize pretty much everything about their laptops, you are also paying a premium for that. And what exactly does that premium get you, upgradeability when parts are either broken or if you want to upgrade to the newest version of that component. This assumes this newish company is going to be there with customized parts for this chassis after a standard life cycle for a laptop (maybe 3-5 years). Call me skeptical, I just doubt they are going to maintain this for years to come, also considering the track record for other modular-style laptop companies is kinda trash.   <3
You guys kinda killed their site. It won't really load for me. Btw did they say something about a version compatible with pens?
If you cant upgrade the CPU and GPU then whats the point?
Capri sun
Where can i get 1 very impressive bit of kit 🤔 👏
Sponsor is G-SKİLL but rams are crucial?
All the apple fans are quaking
Now I need it to have a capability to replace the GPU and have a full sized CPU.
lmao the website traffic generated by this video alone took down their website. congrats linus you Ddosed them
Look at that ROG Phone. Linus drop tips continue.... 1:57
2 in 1 plz.
It should be illegal to make electronics that cant be repairable by users. Especially internal batteries that cant be swapped out. They are enragingly anti-consumer and anti-environment.
respect to those guys who came up with this
I know the FrameWork guys are reading this comment, so Kudos to the team on Engineering such a marvel with keeping the customer in mind, can't wait to get mine!
I think we just crashed their website!!
Dude this a dream laptop for everyone
Their website wasn't ready for the amount of clout you just gave them lol
nope, someone will do stupid things with it and try to claim a warranty. Not everybody knows how to handle electronics correctly.
chalupa
i’ve had bad experiences with the goodie finger print scanners
that was one of the cleanest inner laptops other than the MacBook M1
Lol this video is causing so much demand for Framework laptops that their store is going down (at time of writing this videos only been out for ~20 minutes). Well, the product's so good that they totally deserve it!
Hi, the video is 4 mins ago but a comment is 9 mins ago
sadly no ethernet jack :(
A work of love indeed, amazing job Framework!!
We crashed their website.
whop… think you slashdotted  the webpage…
9:12 Is that a thing now? Wow.
1:55 Anyone else didn't surprise that Linus' phone is cracked?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAnd I think you guys overloaded their webpage :D
website is down, lol, you're literally saturated framework servers
Their website went down.
Odds are, no one is going to make those modules because the market isn't there yet, so it doesn't actually matter. Hopefully I'm wrong and this gets picked up.
Am I actually the only one that likes thicc laptops?
Their site crashed due to too many viewers going and taking a look. That's how you know a review is good.
It took all of 5 minutes of this video being out for the framework site to go down from the sudden spike in visitors. I'd call that a success.
I would nut if this thing was somewhat open source and had a design guide for making your own upgrade module.
The frame work website is running a bit slow right now :p (just after video release)  Edit : and now the site has crashed good job LTT
The Linus effect? - Can't connect to the Framework website. They are undergoing maintenance.
1:56  How many times Linus drop his phone 😂😂😂
This is sick!!!!
Dam somthing I'd actually buy
Apple is scared shitless right now
I wonder why Linus use I watch ,  If he uses a Samsung mobile
welcome back to kitchen set
That’s how it looks like when engineering isn’t bottlenecked by companies. What an incredible product.
When engineers turely design and sells a product ..... U get MARVELOUS PRODUCTS.
Talk about reparability of this laptop is amazing.
8:18 welcome back Linus drop tips
I'm wet... but my pockets are empty :'(
This is what I've been wishing for for years
I think their server is suffering...  xD
Crashed their website good job
The environmental impact of this would be be SO much less
Loving these pro-sustainability videos 👍🏽
On one hand I'd love to support this product but on the hand they might turn into Samsung also the site crashed
Their main website states it is under maintenance right now. This has me peaked! Okay, going to finish the video and edit this if I need too. (comment was FYI for any trying to view site) Edit: Wow! This is actually amazing! I do hope that they come out with motherboards with the ability to upgrade the CPU. AMD APU upgrade would be cool! Perhaps a slightly bigger laptop with an upgrade path for the GPU, or adding one. Way cool, Linus! Thanks for showing this!
I am going to buy this freaking laptop for college next year.
manufacturers arent making devices impossible to upgrade because its not possible, or because they dont trust you to upgrade it. They're doing it because they want you to buy another of their products in 2-3 years time. they want more money, they don't care that you get less for it, as long as they get more of it from you. Honestly this company is exactly how ALL manufacturers should be, but it'll never happen, more profit in selling ewaste
Kinda reminds me of the older thinkpads, they were nearly equally modular in their design
I am really hoping this catches on everywhere we need this for the future  I am literally saving every penny for the top of the line diy version with all components
Man I haven't seen him this excited for a while.
LTT literally crashed their website from all the traffic
"that's just sounds like PC with extra steps"
Alright, who bet that there won't be any parts available for it in a handful of years ?
Okie dokie
Society if apple took notes: "Yes. I dont see a problem with vaccines"
I love this !
I see my next Notebook :-) Their landing page is behaving a bit sluggish right now, likely due to the 12K viewers that have allready seen this... I wish them all the sales in the world.
I seem to recall this concept cycling around every few years... I think Dell or preHP Compaq had one with CPU and GPU modules and a PCI accessory slot.
Linus resembles a kid on Christmas day
This is gonna have to be the future of laptops
rossmann would be so trigged by first 20 seconds
PLEASE MAKE THIS A STABLE PRODUCT SO THAT BIG DOGS ACTUALLY GET RATTLED AND MAKE USER-FRIENDLY PRODUCTS
Imma1st=
#righttorepair
Apple's excuse would be something like " Our goal is to make a product that doesn't require repairs and upgrades"
You're litterally BUYING segways now? Amazing Linus~
Linus Laptop Tips
This video crashed their website
Dude this laptop's super cool!
Oh my god that poor note 9 without a case..... WHAT HAS HE DONE TO YOU!?!? POINT ON THE SMARTPHONE DOLL WHERE HE TOUCHED YOU! 1:57
Ngl, those excuses stopped holding water years ago.
The website won't even load because so many people are checking it out 🤣🤣🤣
I think an multi port usb c dongle defeats the purpose of this laptop.
how much does ltt segue cost?
This is Awesome!! Nice review!
Wot if u could build ur own car or even house
I want to upgrade the gpu and cpu like that
I thought my Internetconnection broke down, but its just als the linus tech junkys SPAMMING the frame.worke site, configuing their new laptops
I just watched the ifixit video about this…
Man will I ever see a day when I can change the processor and gpu on my laptop?
This will be my next laptop.
is anyone else currently having trouble using the framework website
Yes, I was sooooo looking forward to this video when somebody mentioned this product at work.
For me, this is one of the most exciting things of the year so far, even if you can't put Nvidia RTX graphics cards in it!
I saw this on pcgamer, Gordon unboxed it and showed off before
Giveaway one gaming laptop please 🥺
Still no ODD . .
This needs to be industry standard.
Louis will be all wet about this.
I'll buy 3 of them
1:37 Even your audience wasn't ready for a beatdrop like that.
Louis Rossmann gonna love this <3
Watching this video 2 mins after launch... the framework website has shit the bed XD did all the LTT fans accidentally ddos it
The perfect laptop does not exist Framework: Hold my QR codes!
Aaand the website is down.
Did this video crash their website?
OPEN SOURCE IS THE FUTURE
This reminds me of Google's project Ara. It's such a shame that never came to fruition
Oh. A Factorio laptop that has to be manually crafted.
those engineers making people's life easier, they're reserving a seat in heaven.
"Cry me a river Linus"🤣🤣🤣
"What I bought was this sponsor segue" I mean technically the sponsor bought it Linus
I've been waiting for this review
Imagine if this was every laptop
Congrats Framework.
This isn't an incredibly new idea. Look at milspec tough laptops, like Panasonic Toughbook and Thinkpad T Laptops. Not as elegant, but far more upgradable, and way more powerful.  Actually, most business grade as well. Look at HP640 G5, or up, laptops. Not limited to USB-C modules.
First
All I can say is, "Thank You, Framework!"
I mean... does it look good tho? I don't know about that one, chief.
That is good that you have sponsor which has repairable devices :D
less than 5 minutes into the video and i'm sold
And their site went down in 4 min
8 minutes gang
I really want this in a 2-in-1. So badly. With an active digitizer.
finally framework is getting atleast 5% of the attention they require.
And now their site is down ... thanks Linus Ha!
I really hope that framework keep afloat! Heard about this a few days ago, great concept, love it. Can't wait for it to be available in the UK (w/ ISO keyboard).
This company has to succeed, I need them to succeed.
Was waiting for this moment
Modular PSUs, modular phones and now modular Laptops… what a time to be alive!
I still missed socketed mobile cpu
This is the coolest laptop I have ever seen!  If I need a laptop again, this will be my next laptop.
I REALLY hope these guys at Framework are successful. This is a promising product.
not even to the 4 minute mark and im just sittin here saying shut up and take my money
I’m early :)
I work at a computer repair shop and just this week I had to tell like 5 people their laptop is DOA because the motherboard and repair cost is more than the laptop is worth. BTW whoever designed the wifi antenna connectors needs to the kick in the head.
First product that I actually want to buy
Also you had forgot to mention "no soldered on keyboard".
It's improvable to incentive as such as a laptop to be undermined accord to Newton's third law.
That's kinda cute. Tho I usually buy the cheapest laptops but since intel atoms are not around anymore.. im waiting on ARM to be the main thingy for everyone
their site overloaded by all the people who want to check it out and maybe even order one of these.  Nice.  Can't wait for it to work again so I can get myself one as well
*visible confusion*
am 3 minutes in and I'm already thinking this will be my next laptop purchase
Just perfect. If it had a discrete GPU I would pay 3K easily
hey linus can i get a gpu since i bought my pc in 2021 and it does not have a good gpu it has a z490 gaming x mother board, 10600k i5, 16 gb ram and a cv 650 and a gt 710 so like the people u gave a 3060 can i also get a graphic card. if u dont believe me u can dm on insta gram and i can dm my pc pictures to u hope u see this dude, i will be happy even if i get a 4gb or 6gb gpu samudra_sombody- insta
Halfway through and this looks freaking amazing
This seems like a really good product! Too bad nothing good ever lasts. hahahahaha
ok i found my next laptop thank you framework
Like a wise man once said: "If you find a laptop, There is bound to be something upgradable".
see it! love it!
Framework is now my new favorite laptop manufacturer, and I'm hoping to be able to buy my next machine from them in the future. I need one with a dGPU though.
Damn this company is making its YouTube advertising rounds.
1:38 nobody had faith in him not even his co-workers, but somehow he didn't drop it this time.
Thank you for broadcasting your sponsor segments so I know when to SKIP.  Also, way to go, guys.  You crashed their site.
Just watch the tested videos! Two reviews! The ports are so so limited.  Four ports!
I was just searching for something like this earlier today
i hope this would be a real first step to all repairable devices fingers crossed
This is what you want to see
From building a desktop pc to building a laptop Tech is really evolving
This is revolution, apple. Learn from it.
Feel like alot of the stuff here is native advertising
LTT: *An upgradeable laptop* ThinkPad T420/T430s: Am I a joke to you
Ok, lately I have been pondering.....Does Framework have a BIOS that allows the user to use Advanced Settings?
FINALLY! I was thinking about this for about 5 years!!(the modular ports)
what if a verified person replies here
239th comment right huur
Love that Linus's phone is all cracked to shit.
1:30 you missed late stage capitalism
Engineers from Apple intentionally making something repairable? Now that’s something you don’t see every day
Weird, he didnt drop it
We LOVE companies that do what Framework is doing. Simple.
pog
Upgradeable laptops should've been a thing 6-8 yrs ago
The day when these types of laptops are as affordable as normal laptops...
can u pls suggest a high speed 1 tb ssd under Rs 13,000 .....
Louis Rossmann would finally be proud that at least someone is trying
Order number - R991738117. Go divert it boys lol.
Right To Repair: Exists LTT: Hold my beer
Can I have a pc please with a cherry on top?
A rather great time to contemplate life choices and enjoy opening my pc and appreciating how easy to place the damn parts are...
Oh yeah, this will totally not end up like other upgradable/open source/sustainable laptops.
You can't repair a toughbook. Well, the new ones maybe, but the old ones just didn't break.
Why did you guys started using these big cringy fonts at the start of each video?
“It’s Thin and Gorgeous”  *Just like my crush*
I hope the parts stay readily available down the road
that catch at 1:38 tho
Linus: "It did not arrive in one piece" Realized where it was going and just decided to get it over with.
This camera work is really shaky today
If every laptop was like this..
i dont appreciate you calling me an idiot within the first minute of the video linus
Google's modular tile phone concept on something the size of a laptop would be actually kind of nice.
I am a big fan and I wanted Pc for years so if I could get to build one with you I would love it so much
Anyone else see this on ifixit?
sax
“oooooooohhh, it even comes with a screwdriver”   thats what you get excited about
You only need to buy overpriced proprietary upgrades
How all laptops should be tbh. Sucks when you have to just buy a completely new one instead of being able to upgrade it other than the most basic of parts like ram and storage.
You need to change your intro Linus
1:38 first nunchaku laptop in the market
The Phone Blocks theory, in a laptop? Google gave up on Project Ara years ago, but this is Awesome!!!
Shut up linus
I'm really early 😃
how well does it preform in terms of the laptop experience? like keyboard flex
No dGPU. Cringe.
Hi
An upgradable laptop? Finally he upgraded his content!
Next Video: Putting an RTX 3090 into a laptop!
Yo
I am interested...
YouTube crashed when the video has been out less than a minute ago lol
Where do I buy one of these laptops?
Ah balls I’ve already watched this on floatplane - great video though, I almost bought one on the back of this.
Here within a minute, but far from the first :P
Linus paid for a Segway   Mmm anti stonks
asd
can someone explain why this video has 112 views and 464 likes XD...
The way he tells about his sponsors with ease
Btw love ur vids
ltt
Louis Rossman was almost triggered in the intro.
Speed
Imagine if everything was upgradable and renewable no trash and companies not for the betterment of mankind weren't here
How come there are 16 views and 130 comments
This is really cool
Cool!
Sup everyone how’s it going?
Nice I’m early
I've been looking forward to this review! Framework seems to have set its own framework for a revolution in laptop computing.
need it
Framework doing gods work
Elegant and repairable is just like me and my ex's relationship
I wish more laptops did this.
When he said *”your idiot hands couldn’t repair it“,*  *I felt that!*
I CAME HERE PRETTY FAST LETS GOOOOOOO (also, a younger me would have murdered for a completely modular laptop)
I was waiting for the video and I love the time when he uploads it
The question is..... Price to performance?
