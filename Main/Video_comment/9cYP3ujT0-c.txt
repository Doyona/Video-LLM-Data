snickers are garbage in US. it would be nice to have some good chocolate here
I 👍🏻 to 👀, the way you eat 🇬🇧, but never exchange that! 7:40
Snickers belong to 🇬🇧. But 🤢
6:47 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can’t have snicker bars anymore besides there not healthy
I want slice and share but i want share.  I love snickers un healthily
I’ve tried US food it’s ok but the Uk food is healthier
The us candy taste horrible the uk candy taste best
Shared this to my contacts and they are scared of the one pounder, how in the would would you share this monster?  Also got the following feedbacks:  - I would go 3 on a busy day (Food delivery service on a bike between cities, 20Km in a day) - I needed Moar!!! (More with a Roar, a Kickboxer) - Do you want a 2 pounder? Something fancy? (A foodie and Baker).  Either way, something to keep an eye on... 👀🍫😮
The huge Snickers bar is more of a novelty item to try maybe once, rather than a genuine sharing bar
10:43 gimme that
Only America could  put artificial flavor in children`s candy.  Desperate greed to profit at any cost.
any snickers from EU is better than US
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 snickers $150
10:33 different kind of video is starting ;)
😊😊😊😅
Why was the british guy given  Hershey chocolate, and not an American snicker. Snickers isn't a product of Hershey.
Harry went like lil bitsss
The reason why American chocolate tastes like vomit because there is snow element that contains baby vomit 😮
Snickers USA = Larger but taste like garbage due to Buyteric acid and what qualifies as "chocolate" Snickers UK = Taste better but smaller.
4:55 MASSIVE Difference
Snickers is my favourite chocolate in the world 🎉
Iam from uk 🇬🇧 I'm glad we won the chocolate 🍫 snakers bar 🏆 ✌️ 💪🏼
No one in the UK uses “candy bars”
UK have mini snickers in forms of Celebration snack boxes, often sold around holidays. snickers mini alongisde, mars and milky way and others are incorperated in said boxes. sorry if this has already been answered but hey.
US chocolate is not good but neither is UK- it's very basic bulk. I like Swiss, French and Swedish the best.
Uh ok. What they should have done was a blind taste test, so no biases, but I guess that's asking for too much. I find UK chocolate very tasteless, would not take anything from Cadbury over Hersheys. Hersheys is a bit more chalky but I can taste the chocolate unlike anything from Cadbury. The rest of Europe just adds hazelnut to like all their chocolates, good but tiring.
So a snickers in america is not the same snickers as here in europe? Is this the same of a glass of coca cola?   Different taste and everything?
Watching an american try proper chocolate for the first time will never fail to make me smile
i can't be the only one who thinks harry is super cute right
I just got back from NYC, and i purchased a snickers at JFK, jesus christ..... american snickers absolutely SUCK! there's like no salty roasted peanut flavour at all. WAYYYYY too sweet. UK snickers 4 life.
in the UK, you can also get the white chocolate snickers
Try this:  Food Wars: Dove (US) vs Galaxy (UK)
Hearing Harry say 'candy bar' instead of Chocolate Bar hurt my brain. If we start to say things incorrectly to cater to dumbericans then we'll all just fall into turmoil.
In the uk you also get tiny snickers in the celebrations tubs
he said the n word
Omg that massive snickers 🤤🤤🤤🤤
do it canada vs usa please🙏
its pronounced new-git
I find Uk or european chocolates much better than US chocolates and of higher quality
3:00 In the US, the 10% chocolate liquor requirement **excludes** cocoa fat. But the EU and UK’s minimum 25% total “dry cocoa solids” includes cocoa fat.  If cocoa fat was included in the US legal definition, that cocoa content would be higher too.
Where do they sell the Snickers loaf? I’ve never seen one.
"ᴺᶦᶜᵉ"
the vomit aftertaste of american chocolate is due to the Hershey proccess.
i can't follow
Great information. LOVE UK Chocolates!!!
I believe the smallest snickers bar would be the Celebrations size we get here in the 🇬🇧 not sure about the 🇺🇸 T though..
Wait isn’t snickers in UK call Marathon bars
UK we do technically have a really small bar that you'll find in a tub of celebrations
We do have fun size/bite size dude needs to look harder 😂
peanutbutter satisfies ur hunger.

In terms of quick snacks, it is the best, and sits well in the stomach compared to other quick chocolates that I can't eat because they taste like Snickers to me
The vomity taste in US chocolate is likely Butaic Acid, which is a chemical found in Stomach Acid. Since the UK doesn't put Butaic acid in chocolate, they aren't used to stuff that tastes like that.
Omg when I travel to Europe I will eat nothing but chocolate.
My brother in law gifted us US snickers and M&Ms , it went straight into the bin 🤢
They forgot in the Ik the celebration snicker
I blame this video for my purchase of tubs of Cadbury Heroes and Mars Celebrations. I'm trying to cut down my portion sizes and I'm bored with the kind of candy we have here.
There was me thinking the largest Snickers in the US was one serving.
4:56 he taste britain for the first time. He discovered life
Did you know Snickers used to be called Marathon in the UK
Our chocolate 🍫 doesn't taste like vomit, that's cheap shot at us in America. 😤😠😡🤬
In India we got butterscotch snickers and snickers cashew
join uk
Haha yes. "Sharing" bars
UK chocolates are better than US but US sweets are better than UK
My dad went to america for Christmas last year and bought back the big snickers, I un assembled it and made a lovely moist cake. 😂
I love american personality and american food  Ajd hate uk personialies and sweets
SNICKERS is for me an indulgence I'm not worried about the ingredients..I love them for breakfast lunch and dinner.
I miss snickers cruncher
6:47 That's a Snickers on --STEROIDS--
1 lb snickers bar because merica baby
Just for the fact of staying loyal I'd still pick the US
It’s because Hershey “dutches” it’s chocolate.
This man said nougaw
I pronounce it like nugget
my best one is from kuwait cuz am from kuwait🇰🇼
Polish Snickers is 51 or 75 grams
Nice to know that the UK doesn't have self control either.
Us snickers portion sizes are snickers bites in a bites bag which is 80.2 grams and a grab and go snickers bites which is 133.2 grams, mini snickers 17 grams, fun size snickers 20.2 grams,
I would say one "size" you potentially missed is the Celebrations size.
The vomit aftertaste is from a chemical preservative in American chocolate, butyric acid. You also find it in parmesan cheese, apparently.
lol that's not sharing size that's going to the movies size 😉😋👍
US Snickers is garbage unfortunately. Whenever I go to Ukraine, I always bring Snickers bars back, I believe it’s imported from Poland. EU version of Snickers tastes so much better.
These things might be great But we all now that Pods are just better
De / Germany is um¿
i wan them to get more europeans like us vs finland or something like that
Won t be buying  one of these again . Spat out all the bits of peanut left in my mouth  once the chocolate had gone down. Most annoying .
i love snickers
and of course you cut the big snickers are you crazy
the little bites are the minis just unwraped
UK snikers my favourites are the snikers flapjack bars and he snikers profile  bars they're just more dense and heavy and a lot more filling as a snack than the traditional snikers... plus the chocolate they're coated in which is by mars confectionary is the same formula as we get in a solid bar of galaxy  milk chocolate bar, which I believe came about because of many requests for mars confectionary t make solid bars of the chocolate because so many of us enjoyed the chocolate coating of mars and snikers( mars &marathon as they were known as she I was a kid) so mars confectionary birthed galaxy milk galaxy dark and the new range of galaxy with bits and fillings.. personally I prefer the mars confectionary chocolate to cadburies or bournville because of its silky creamy texture and it's sweeter taste and the non artificial vanilla flavour makes it taste just right.... UK chocolate is way superior to the American chocolate
American chocolate smells like shit an tastes disgusting...seriously I was 23 someone brought me some hershys back from a holiday as a gift I got all excited I opened the wrapper and the smell gold my nose I immediately was like nope this chocolate smells like ass swet for real... I eventually broke a peice of and tasted it... it was vile and didn't have that melt in the mouth consistency I was used to from Chocolate in UK  Australia  France Italy Germany Belgian dutch or Swiss... American chocolate is more like a chocolate flavoured soft candy it has a waxy feel and taste to it even with reeses bars mind you u do like reeses but that's purely because they're sweat and salty and there's very little of what Americans call chocolate coating the peanut butter sticks... however the chocolate from America is still as disgusting now as the first time I tried a hershys bar
I like the 4:56
Hersheys is the worst chocolate though
king size mars bar/snickers was the best thing , till around 2003/4,  then quality dropped and the king size.
In India , an exclusive flavour is pistachio and Almond
I'm a year late but I've seen white chocolate snickers in the UK and had snickers ice cream bars. They're delicious.
Jede Woche Snickers
Snickers is such a thing in UK US? 🤐 In India I have only had the snickers bar and not liked it. Kitkat supremacy
UK chocolate is nasty. Their only saving grace is After 8s, but only because of the mint.
UK missing the snickers protein bar and snickers smooth peanut butter
No idea why but this may be my favourite episode
Brooo in Germany Snickers is in my opinnion one of the wirst chocolate Bars. I don't want to know how your American Shit tastes. Everything i Had from America was Just Shit in Terms of food.
jOE YOU SAID lACTOSE TWICE.
I think you missed one as there is also a white snickers
there is a snickers soda!!!
well no wonder the americans say bigger is better
No hazelnut Snickers?
Do Skittles
There is a smaller Snickers in the UK, and that is the tiny one in boxes of Celebrations
7:34 If Poland was included there, then there would be literally the same exclusives as the US has.
The British guy calling it a candy bar 🤦🏻
Uk anthem 100% better
cap i  saw the american bag in a brittish shop
'Slice and share' AKA 'dinner when you just can't be arsed'.
You forgot the ice cream snickers
Snickers is great but God damn Europe's chocolate is just so much better
USA chocolate is so bad. Australian chocolate is where it's at!
You can't get your hands on Snickers Bitesize?!! What?!!  Ever walk into a Family Dollar? If not, I suggest you do. You might have some luck. Have 'em here.
in Pakistan we get the UK or Arabian version which is also close to UK one. I got one from USA once and I can indeed confirm there is a weird aftertaste,  while as texture wise UK ones seems always good but it loses its shape in hot climate faster compared to US one which has better preservation.  Seriously try Cadbury Eclair's from UK and from anywhere else in the world, you will get addicted to the UK one no matter what.
I ate half a mars bar when i was in LA. Could not finish it. It was soo much sweater than It's European counterpart. I happily stuck to burgers, which i all loved.
7:58 Nice touch, removing all the small bars from the box.
Where is the snickers ice cream bar
4:40 proves that the us has bigger nuts
The smallest uk serving is the snickers in the celebrations box
At 4:28 🐰🐇😄 😆 🤣
After seeing this now I really want some Snickers
Not one mention of the dick vein…
The sour taste of Hershey's chocolate is intentional. Milton Hershey accidentally soured his milk in his original recipe due to the insistence on being the first milk chocolate to use fresh milk. Now they intentionally add a sour taste to preserve the original Hershey's flavor.
In India you can get pistachio and butterscotch
Your forgetting fun size also in uk
Forgot about snickers white and can also get snickers bitesize mini bars
6:48
Peanut butter snickers is too good
Can we have a mars bars food wars
In the Us their mini bars in the bag I actually hate it in the UK
I can confirm that the UK representative said candy, truly shocking
In Australia our Snickers are made in China, I haven't eaten a Snickers in 4yrs
Marathon
taste test 3:41
Come to Canada we have better chocolate then usa other then original hersheys but that's because there made by different more European companies
I swear the British guy is usa and the usa guy is British!
9:43 I thought Harry loved that Snickers, but instead, he hated it (9:45)!
Honestly though, UK/EU chocolate is better than what we got here in the US of A
I know exactly what that UK guy means about the vomit taste originally when first trying American chocolate. When I first ever tried hersheys some years back it had a distinct sh*t with soap taste, and that's all I could describe it as, but when I had  it again years later is was better? And now I enjoy it when I can get it lol
3:51 That's because some chocolates like hershey's contain the same chemicals that gives vomit it's smell and taste. Yeah i know, it sounds disgusting and it is
That Rick and Morty reference tho xD love, it.
hands down snickers bar is the best chocolate/sweet/ bar ever created. the combination is the most perfect a food can ever get!
The UK forgot to feature the snickers from celebrations.
I pronounce it nougat
Do a Mars Bar vs Milky Way(US version).
I had a triple bar of snickers from wh Smith's in UK and they forgot the ice cream  white chocolate and the extra nut's bar
You can also get a Snickers peanut butter bar
Not true, US has Snickers crisp as well
Jul 19 2016
I like British and American chocolates both in different ways
I can remember when Snickers was called Marathon
Honestly never liked snickers
The reason you are getting the gross after taste is Beacuse the put the same enzyme that you have in your sick in the American chocolate
What about the snickers milkshakes in the uk
I bought a peanut butter snickers in LA airport in 1990. My first and last experience with American chocolate.. I’ll never forget the mouth filling texture crime
What about the protein snickers bars? You guys don't have those? They're awesome!
Can you do mentos
This lad is one kinky chav.  And Joe can very much enjoy all British candy he wants if he joins one of my fav FB groups, petition to revoke the American independence.
it was so satisfying to hear joe to admit that our chocolate is better than US chocolate 😭
I liked them better when they were called Marathons. Snickers is just a stupid made-up name.
I recently tried Snickers Almond in asia and i have to say its way more sweet than the classic one. Also here Cadbury rules therefore we are derived with other Snickers products.
White snickers is the best snickers
The smallest size of snickers is actually in tubs of Celebrations.
.
The almond snickers were available here in the uk for a while they were more expensive but one of the most enjoyable chocolate bars I’ve ever tasted - far superior to regular snickers x
I can’t eat peanuts and I never seen snickers but the logo look cool and the uk is good
I live in England. Can confirm that our Snickers are so so good. Some of the best chocolate you can buy.
Hershey first made his candy bars with slightly sour milk and it was a wallaw kinda taste  So if you had the vomit taste it cause if this Nougat...,nu-get...this is how we pronounce it
UK chocolate is amazing. US chocolate is like eating chocolate-scented soap that's had sugar mixed in. We don't even realize it until we have good chocolate.
We have bites in the UK but tbh its pretty much a lot of the celebration ones
For the US I didn’t know about the biggest one
Those bite size chocolates are the best for athletes that needs a quick sugar boost. I would rather eat chocolates than fxking granola bar or oat bar that taste like shit when I'm on the rode with my bike.
$159.00?!!! Ah NO!!
I love this comparisons, the American guy is even as annoying as some Americans I’ve encountered
Why is the British guy calling it a “candy bar”? We never say that here, ever. It’s a chocolate bar. Weird
Only 10% and 20% that explains why both uk and us have poor chocolate.
I remember we used to have Snickers Flapjacks in the UK, I think they are discontinued now but they where one of the best things I ever tasted, I don't mean the protein flapjacks either, they were partnered with Mcvities and came in packs of 5
Americans love to talk abt how their lack of regulations leads to tastier foods...but chocolate is one of those areas where its just better everywhere else because its required to actually BE chocolate xD
You can't get sick eating SNICKERS....
Love Snickers.
Snickers crisp is amazing
The Hershey’s vomit thing is from butenic acid (I think) there’s probably an Adam Ragusa video about it
In Iran:
In spain we have snickers white chocolate, that shit is amazing 🤤
Not had one since they stopped calling it Marathon.
Glasses man. It is pronounced Cho-co-late   Not choclate there is a co in the middle.
can anyone remember Snickers was known as Marathon
you forgot the white one
snickers almond butter is honestly one of the best chocolate bars I've ever eaten, unfortunately I found it once here in the UK and never again
american candy is worst
wtf he said the n word
I like the little bar s i from Canada so just like usa. . 😎. Video.
Now I just want a snickers!!! lol 😂 and the guy from UK is 🥵🥵🥵 ohh ma gawwd lol
Never having a snickers again. I must go to the UK.
American chocolate is f**king vile!
I guess neither of you know about the Snickers energy bar?
A green smoke.. then bring em on! nami nam
Y’know that Hershey’s uses child/slave labour?
Makes me mad that he decided to pick out the worst American candy bar, Hersheys
I’m waiting for South Africa vs USA food wars 😏
In Russia we have Snickers with hazelnuts and White Chocolate Snickers as well as USA's Almond Snickers and Britain's Crispy Snickers
You guys should do Reese’s <3
As a man that does live in mid asia I can tell. Our cold climate make snikersses so dence that they stay such even after refreezing. So no one eats snikersses at winter....or any caramel containing snaks.
cameraman can't math
When the adult Harry Potter called Snickers a candy bar fml 🤦‍♂️
Don’t know why I’m watching this, I don’t even like snickers.
Where’s the almond joy best candy
Lays and kitkat next
Joe forgot to include the snickers ice cream bar it’s practically a snickers bar just with ice cream on the inside
0:14 so why even name them I'm sure there are hundreds of snickers you couldn't get your hands on so why name it
The creamy peanut butter snickers is my favourite, I don't they don't disappear.
Chocolate bars are a joke here in the UK been getting smaller and smaller well not worth the price anymore.
Slice and share? Yeah, right.
It would also be interesting to compare Snickers from 20 years before. After the spread of the cheaply produced palm oil they replace cocoa butter, butter and everything with it. And I swear eating today's chocolate sometimes is like licking sweetened margarine...
UK snickers is smoother?  You would thought you can't beat the USA in chocolate.  :)
6:47 Everything bigger in Texas vibe :D
Detrimental effect from fructose rather than glucose? Interesting.  I always thought the other way around. There are diabetic chocolate made from fructose around me...
Do twix or KitKat next
I know i’m biased as a brit but i did always think UK chocolate tastes so much creamier and nicer than the US! The US chocolate tasted like the cheap stuff you’d get from the pound shop 😂
Forgetting atleast 3 sizes in UK , selection box the one that comes in fun size multi pack and the trio bars
Only us old skool lot still call snickers marathon
Snicker Bar ice cream is better than all the other Snicker Bars combined.
What about the ice cream?
Make one about a mars bar
When I first arrived in Florida on a 2 week holiday, me and my parents picked up some food from a shop nearby to where we were staying. I saw a Hershey’s bar and was like ‘OOH THATS THE THING’ and my mum bought it for me  I tried it, and I have never been so close to throwing up in a supermarket before
You forgot the Skickers Icecream Bars UK
There's non-vomity American chocolate. It's just not the Hershey or that Mars brand.
US chocolates are never good Tastes like rubbish
We have crisp in Russia and it's my favourite
0:11
Lmao on Little Bits reference
they forgot about the snickers protein bar
You forgot Snickers ice-cream (UK exclusive I think, even if it's not a comparison would've been nice)
It will always be a marathon to me
*Chocolate bars, not "candy bars", thank you.
what about in the uk, u can get snickers protein form sports direct
Lol Joe hating having to praise 👏 the UK bar XD  My us freind loved tge Aero bars when I send them oh and galaxy bars and dariy milk hit chocolate
This is good to note. Next time I’m in Europe, I can buy some of these candy bars and bring them back to the US as gifts.
YOU NOT YOU WHEN YOURE HUNGRY
i NEED chocolate from EU or UK now so i can see what the difference is😠
US Chocolate has a weird wax coating or some shit
You guys didn't include the Snickers ice cream bars, ice cream, dipped popsicles, cookies, and other Snickers items. There's way more out there!
Not hersheys 😭
Now I'm really curious to try a UK snickers. I agree that Hershey's is the worst...🤢🤮 I don't even consider it real chocolate. And I was born in Pennsylvania. 🤷‍♀️
shut up harry are is  good
0,5kg Snickers :)
No hate but uk is just boring
Anti-patriotism. Another unfortunate side effect of hunger. Grab a Snickers. Peanuts, caramel and chocolate. Hungry? Grab a Snickers.
The white choco snickers is the best of all time
I thought we UK were gonna lose lol
Missing the celebration box ones and also the ice cream versions
In the us everything contains a very very high chance of diabetes
Uk 🇬🇧is way more better than us 🇺🇸snicker bar
Hey make  a Hershey's and Cadbury food wars please
Damn snickers is so good, you can have that massive bar produced in the uk style as a sandwich for lunch, that’d be awesome.
What about Snickers ice cream bars?
I can find all of them in middle east
Love the show, but I feel so bad for Joe after eating all that candy but his comments made me laugh all the same. Poor guy, he must have had a miserable night after this. I really want to get my hands on a UK Snickers now just to see if it really does taste different than the ones in the US.  That Share Size is a joke.
plot twist: usa is communist they make the vomit aftertaste to make people suffer instead of enforcing them into labor
The chocolate made in the U.S contains the same chemical you release when you vomit. But since people like me eat it since we were kids we're not affected by that side effect since we grew out of it
I wish the UK kept the name Marathon, Snickers still sounds silly to me
No wonder obesity is through the roof in the US.
US's Snickers Almond can be found in India too
i like how they are both funny but in completely different ways 💀
You should try the Snickers ice cream bars they are yummy!!!
Love how he says no one shares it, I do because it’s too rich for me to eat alone so I share with my husband :)
6:26 - *nice*
you should do one where you just guess if its from us or the uk
I got 16 almond snickers in the uk from tesco today then i saw this video. Us now does not have the almond snickers as an exclusive anymore
uh what about the mini snickers in a celebration box? 1:45
Can you do kitkat next all these food wars have been brands made in the us
Is that a snickers in your knickers or are you just protein bar to see me?
I live in america and have had chocolate for years and never had a vomit aftertaste in my life
I swear we do have the snickers bites in the uk, my dad threw some at me the other day lmao
BRO HOW U FORGET SNICKERS ICE CREAM UK
In Macedonia we only have the normal size🤣
When an episode about France is coming up ?
4:56 he's been colonized lads
I think US sizes are over the board
Show
UK does have a smaller snickers. You can get them in the celebrations chocolate collection. Yes that is a mix of different chocolates but for the cereal you showed stuff in multi packs.
in morroco we have the snickers krisp it's fantastic
Spread the gospel turn toGod,Amen
If I was not diabetic I’d want to eat that huuuugggeeee American giant bar.
That giant Snickers looks like a d*ck lol
You should do Hershey
4:13   Harry: “whats on this?”  Me: Nytroglycerin.
“Your not you when your hungry eat a snickers” And in Ireland we have snickers ice cream it’s great
We can get the almond snickers in Tescos and Sainsbury’s so it isn’t ‘’native” to America
That "nice" got me so off guard lmaoooo
you forgot the snickers you can get in the celebration tins I think
MARATHON
New Zealand has the best chocolate, it is superior, particularly whittakers. I cant be swayed to believe anything else.
Try chocolate from the UK✍🏼
I got all my chocolate snack from World Market. They have so many European chocolate and they are so much better.
I know .. our chocolate is SO good .. we are blessed :)  But then most European countries too :D
The snickers almond can be found in India
It’s well known why American chocolate tastes lie puke, it’s the preservatives they put in milk. It contains the same chemicals that are found in puke.
Americans do have snickers crisp. I would know. I work at the Mars plant in Texas that makes all the snickers for American consumers
How about the next video is about Reese's UK vs the United States
In Ireland we seem to have all the same Chocolate as the UK apart from Cadbury (Irish is nicer IMO) I went to the US a few years ago & found pretty much all the Chocolate to be horrible, maybe I should move over & I'd give up Chocolate 😆😆 oh & same for Pizza too I reckon
That was not American Hershey chocolate, its Chinese Hershey chocolate.
After this I would have diabetes
I  don't like milkshake 📛🦡🏸
Make one with indian food in 🇺🇸 vs 🇬🇧
I Love this show however I recommend investing in a better camera.
7:45 appears to have forgotten that children exist 😂
The slice and share is one big bar. I wouldn’t share it if had one.
Um, I have definitely bought Snickers Crisp in the U.S. many times... is that not a thing here anymore? I haven't seen them recently, but they were actually my 2nd favorite, after the almond variety. They might have been called "Crisper" in the U.S. Does anyone else remember this?
Noo gat it is for me. Chocolate lover right here
i'm old, I grew up in the UK and Snickers was called a Marathon bar
Little bits 🤣🤣🤣
You can thank WW2 for that "vomit" flavor.
I'm no sure if they know this but theres actually an ice cream version of the snickers bar as well (at least at the shop near were I live)
Technically we do have bite size ones in UK but they’re the small ones you get in selection boxes at like christmas or halloween
If u do snickers u might as well do skittles
Snickers sell in iran too but iranian made a iranian version named "nani" and it comes in 2 covers: caramel and chocolate
fun fact: noughats are actually from iran (my country)
I wanna ask who ate everything after filiming this video
I hate Hershey’s chocolate. It’s some sort of acid that makes that awful aftertaste.
U should try the snicker ice cream those are to die for 😋
UK also s snickers ice scream in a chocolate bar shape
Should do Australia 🇦🇺 vs us
We do have a fun size Snickers Bar in the UK & Ireland. But you usually find it in a Pick & Mix.
I work in retail and he's missing so many UK snickers
On my trips to NY, I would take a large amount of chocolates and shortbread biscuits for the teams there. The flavours of KitKat from Tokyo were a revelation!
What about the tiny 2cm snickers. They're honestly my favourite
Lol I thought I was the only one who had the vomit taste in American chocolate.
You forget the snickers ice cream 😉
It seems like from what I’ve seen, is that American candy is too sweet/too much compared to UK candy (I’ve seen videos of Brits saying this so don’t come at me pls)
THE BROWNIE ONE IS MY FAVORITE!!!!!! I AM LITERALLY EATING ONE RIGHT NOW!!!!!! HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE IT??????
I don’t know how they eat it 5:42
Okay but the smallest snickers are the ones in Celebration chocolate boxes 🥳
How was there not a mention of how the UK used to call them Marathon?
I think that it's different in each state. Because where I live, I have never seen a 100 calorie Snickers, the King Kong size Snickers, or the two pack Snickers. We do have the snack size Snickers, fun size bars, share bag, regular size candy bar and almond Snickers. Don't know what other states carry. But since Joe has informed us in one episode of Food Wars that he is from sunny California, I think that next time I'm there, I will have to check out the other types of Snickers. Can the UK guy please mail me a few Snickers bars PLEASE!
Uk food sounds healthy
When he said nuga I heard something else
8:18 😂
In Australia we have white chocolate Snickers Nom Nom Nom Nom
I wonder what they do with all these leftover food
In Germany we have white Snickers😍❤️🔥  White chocolate > milk chocolate
UK chocolate doesn't taste more rich too me, just more milky. I can't stand their milk chocolate. Then again I don't really like most milk chocolate.
6:24
What about the fun size snickers in celebrations? Surley thats the smallest snickers in the uk
For Halloween 2 years ago in the US Snickers brought out a limited Ed just caramel and peanuts and it was BOMB
American chocolate is very bad. Can't compete with european, (especially belgian, swiss, french and german) former soviet states (very good belarusian, ukrainian and some russian makers), north african (recently tasted some morrocan and algerian chocolate, was blown away), and asian (also recently tasted japan-made, indonesian and vietnamese). American ''chocolate'' is waaaaay diluted by stuff that shouldn't be there. Yes, I know, like decemt swiss or german made costs twice as much as american, and belgian - all the way up to almost twenty tes more, although you can buy good belguian chocolate at a decent price, but still like three times more than american - all this is preferable than buy some Hershey's or whatever they make there.
It’s subjective but galaxy and daily Milk chocolate are the best
I thought the physicians says there’s no cure for HSV 2!! But I got cured after using Dr Alaho Olu  on YouTube herbal supplements
Uk missed the size found in celebrations .. derp
During WW2 the Brits loved American Hershey bars. The GIs would share them often with the children.
Europe has Switzerland so they win by default. But I don't know why the peanuts are better
I like American chocolate.  I have never noticed the vomit aftertaste. I like European chocolate as well. I love chocolate in general. Snickers crisp are in the United States.
When I lived in America (about a decade ago) Snickers ice cream bars were the best!! So much better than a regular Snickers. They looked like a normal Snickers bar, but the nougat was replaced with vanilla ice cream. We don't have them where I live, now.
Snickers crisp is awesome, we have it in Taiwan🇹🇼 We also had popcorn flavour Snickers a couple months back
3:53 same!
Snickers ice cream!
Yeah US chocolate sucks. The sugar to real chocolate and cocoa/milk fat versus vegetable fats makes a huge difference. Nothing ruins a chocolate bar like vegetable fat and too much sugar. 🤮
nice video
Don't forget Snickers ice cream UK!!
You forgot the Snickers in HERO's, Snickers Flapjack and I'm sure there are a few other variations.
I'm watching this having a Snicker 😂
4:00 Why would you test American chocolate by eating a standard hershies bar...that's like one of the worst chocolates we have haha.
Who doesn't like Hershey's 💀
In the uk your missing the white chocolate version
Wait what! In uk we do have the fun size snickers, lol.
the uk has snickers bits as well
I remember when the fun size first shrunk in the early 2000s.  It was a big deal because here in Texas, size matters :-)
What about ice cream Snickers bars?
UK chocolate: No one compares to me. Belgium/Swiss chocolate: Hold my wrapper.
If look at food insider's content a year ago they've turned into BuzzFeed now
I live in england AMERICA LITTERLY HAS BITES AND GIANT AND TINY
Oh my, thats a big black snicker right there
6:25
Seving sizes are just bs - just show the nutritional breakdown per 100g
Browsing YouTube while eating Snickers peanut brownie ice cream bar and look what I see :)
In the US, we also get fun shaped candy bars for different holidays. I think you can get Santa shaped snickers or trees?
Lil bits… perfect reference!
I need a U.K. friend
Bro how did they forgot the snickers from the celebrations box those ones are very small
Do mr beast burger next pls
all kinds of fast food in the US are bigger and more plentiful which doesn't mean it's a pro.
Your one click can change my whole life JazakAllah support me
I'm so thankful I'm allergic to milk and can't touch any of these... my husband is addicted to Snickers though and he's constantly telling me that the sizes (in Australia) are getting smaller, like a couple grams every time he buys them.
Ameezing 🤩👌
I'm from  the US and I can't stand Hersheys
Do breakfast bars
Bring back the orange CRUNCHER please! By far my absolute favorite.
M&Ms would be a fun one to compare.
We deffo have Snickers FunSize in the UK!
Where's the snickers ice cream bar?!!
Hey, Food Insider. I want you to make a video called “US vs UK Ben & Jerry's | Food Wars” one day.
It’s so funny I’m watching this video but I’ve never really eaten a snicker before   And before anybody says anything it’s cause I can’t eat peanuts
Woah!... That's a lot of research on a snicker bar...
No Snickers ice cream!?
In the UK we have American Candy stores and you can buy all the American candy if you are willing to take a bank loan as it costs a fortune!!
You should do Ben and Jerry's
I don’t think I’ll ever eat a candy bar again after this
By the way harry, nougat is pronounced noo-git.
We also have Snickers ice-cream in the UK... And let's not forget that Snickers used to be called Marathon here
Who's got one of the best jobs in the world then?
US has got Aretha Franklin and Betty White, UK has got Elton John and Mr. Bean.
When he initially opened and showed the bar 10:34 I was immediately traumatized a thought of a cup. That's all I will say because I don't want to traumatize anyone else.
in the us content for cocoa should be minium 10% ,to be allowed called chocolate. why not 5%? its so low anyway
is that giant snickers a new thing because i've never seen or heard about it before
UK chocolate is the best worldwide. Cadbury & Galaxy unbeatable
Thanks
I would like if you did UK vs US Reeses or Cheez it's I think it would be intresting and would defiently watch it.
I don't like Snickers.
I come from Indonesia, especially the border area of ​​Indonesia and Malaysia, I like your vlog trip, bro, with your characteristics, your demeanor is relaxed and interesting to be my reference in the future, greetings from me, bro
The strange taste is because when Hershey's was first being made they used slightly curdled milk that had soured and then dehydrated instead of wasting it. People still enojyed that taste and nowadays they use butyric acid instead to flavour the bars in a similar way. Americans are used to this taste, so taking away that slightly tangy, vomity taste would be strange for them.
I visited US twice and since my first bite of one bar, I knew that Milky Way, Mars etc. are total shit. We have a much better and richer taste in Kazakhstan of the same trademark. Now I know, that I was not hallucinating
you guys haven't covered Wendy's yet
"Celebrations" also contains very tiny snickers bars, but I suppose they don't count as you can't buy them separately.
Missing snickers white chocolate from the US
Are we doing Oreos too or nah?
3:46
Almond Snickers is my favorite
Hwo dare you disrespect the great Biden and his country.
Fun fact : Instead of rising the price of chocolate bars, they simply reduce the weight and call it a day. You'll buy it anyway and they know it.
Oh shit, we got tiny people!
There are snicker crisp and white here 🇸🇪 i live in sweden im not swedish
I was always told by friends who visited the UK frequently McDonald’s, candies, etc always tasted better than ours in the US because the didn’t use as much chemicals, fillers, artificial sweeteners, etc
I have big one
Joe, you forgot the snickers ice cream bar, and white chocolate snickers bar
8:25    …..  I’ve had snickers crispy (same teal color) here in SoCal, like 8 years ago.  UKs looks like a Whatchamacallit by Hershey
Wagamama’s UK vs US 🥰🥰
An American from uk and an English from US. So entertaining😂
Its "New-git"
Wendys do wendys
We had snickers crisp here in the US before but it sold poorly.
Request:US vs Uk little ceasers
Corn syrup is unhealthier (Fructose)   american chocoloate contains Butyric acid its added to milk to keep it longer as dairy farms in the US arent as close to factories. The vomit aftertaste and sometimes smell is the  Butyric acid.  You're welcome. Also in Germany ive seen a snickers white which is basically a white chocolate version
You forgot the snickers protein bar
Chick fil a????
Ngl this just makes me want to try UK foods for a month and see how much different in terms to weight
Uk guy, my man. You missed a bunch of uk snickers. the snicker celebrations, the protein bar, the white chocolate bar, the ice cream bar and the icecream tub
Quema mucho el sol :v
There definitely used to be snickers bites in the uk. Sold in about the same sized bags
Just watched a man eat a snickers bar like a sub. Muricuhhh 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
No cause when I saw the share bar irl it was huge, so I could see how it’s “for 16”
Yeah right 🤓😂😂😂
Isn’t is liqueur?
The way my eyes widened when I saw palm oil
Isn’t there a king size snickers in the US
The price of the bites killed me 😂😂😂😂
10:32 I really flinched.
in the us the bites are always bigger
Everything in America is bigger
The British guy is so bland :(
Snickers ice cream bars are the best! I know they're not technically a chocolate bar but they are just too good.
The UK had white choc snickers for a while. They were delish. :)
oh way down south in the land traitors
Y’all have way too many sizes for a country that’s *poor* in healthcare
I still remember when Snickers were called Marathon bars. When they changed the name, Mars Inc. were apparently oblivious to the fact that no one in the UK had the faintest idea what "snickers" meant. I kept wondering why they named a chocolate bar after a form of laughter. It was literally decades later that I finally figured out they were talking about "sneakers", yet another word that no on in the UK uses, as we actually call them "trainers".  There's a lot of cultural voids like that, which have never been bridged, and yet marketeers continue to remain oblivious, arrogantly presuming that this is Planet America, and feigning indignation and surprise when they're confronted with reality. It's extremely irritating.
I hate Food Wars
If the uk import version of snicker tastes better than the US version already, that is concerning. I've felt that over the last few years, the quality of the UK snickers has absolutely tanked in peanut quality if nothing else.
Yý
The UK has a White chocolate snickers bar
The UK one tastes way better it is so rich in flavor… My favorites including this one and Mars
hahahahhaahahahah
Don't forget the mini snickers in a celebrations box
My Favorite Snacks Of All Time
UK chocolate on top lmao
Wendys uk & us
The difference is *CAPITALISM*
POV : You only like Joe Avella
The UK does have the snickers bites, they come in a bag & are my favourite of all but i can smash a ba in one go so try not to buy them hahaha
In Ukraine there is hazelnut Snickers and it's great (:
In Russia we had a snickers plombir - delicious. It's a bar with ice cream flavor.
That vomity aftertaste is Hershey's. Even in Canada, Hershey's chocolate has that underlying vomit taste. Hence why I never buy Hershey's.
I had the snickers crisp once, a whole packet even, because they only came in a full pack of 6. I ate them all. My stomach and taste buds have wanted a therapist for the trauma that those bars of anguish have caused 'em.  Oh, and a little something to mention, i've eaten a snickers protein bar just recently, it was honestly alright. No nuts in it though.
I have had snickers bites from Sainsburys UK
A bo'ho'wo'hr
I hate to be that guy as I’m all for giving people chances but the English guy needs to be binned off. He simply doesn’t have the personality or drive to be on this channel and comes across as really boring and cringe. Please replace him with someone more entertaining.
When my little country has more types of snickers then there is in the UK. What????????????????????
👍
Please do a UK vs US chilli’s
I'm from Lithuania (a very far and small EU country) - we had Snickers Crisps for ages. Ours double size also is called 2x 75g. Bonus - we have candy sized ones. They all are franchized, made locally.
It’s easy to get any candy by snickers you just got to visit one of their Hershey’s and you’ll see it.
US  had snicker crisp
I think the major thing with UK vs US food is- the processed foods and snacks from the UK are much better quality, and usually better tasting, but the actual dishes and foods cooked (everything from fried chicken to a California burrito) are much better and more flavorful. Pre packaged food goes to the UK, cooked meals and restaurant food goes to the US.
But we do have the fun size in the UK and we have the even smaller size within a celebrations tub!!!   We need an updated video!!!
The difference in the UK peanuts in the snickers bars -- the UK peanuts are roasted. The US peanuts are not.  And you are 100% correct about EU chocolate being better than ours in US. But that only applies to the chocolate bar chocolates. We have really lovely chocolates that come from fine chocolate makers.
Ooh going onto brands now
Hey they didn’t talk about the snickers “100 calorie work out bar” or the tiny celebrations one This is soo sad
8:00 Did he just say the US doesn’t have the double snickers bar? Like what? The other guy was like talking about it earlier??????
It’s the rick and morty reference for me “Little Bits”
please do this but with kit kat’s!!
Buy the bite size! 😡
4:59 what😂
Almond snickers is my favorite kind of snickers, too bad its impossible to find them in stores in Canada these days..
You forgot the snickers ice cream bar
Unfortunately, we in Germany only have a few types of Snickers, Das Originalm Crisp and with peanut butter. Except for the minis and rarely with white chocolate.
I usually buy the Tesco/Lidl/Aldi own brands and they all taste about the same to me, for a third of the price
Hello love from Pakistan ♡♡
Dont know why this is on my reccomendations, already selected dont reccomend channel, i just see this series as pontless without doing a price comparison.
In the UK you’re also missing the white chocolate version
i wish joe had tried to cut the big bar into 16 pieces
Wait so is snickers in UK not allowed to say their bars are made with chocolate? (Less than minimum 25%)
You haven't lived until you've eaten a white chocolate snickers
Butyric acid is why American chocolate tastes like vomit. Americans are just so used to it that they can't taste it.
I now need a show of joe trying all us and uk chocolate variants
The whole "serving size" should be banned. It's just bullshit made to deceive (Americans, I guess). There is no such thing as a serving. There is no such unit. In Europe you get the values / 100g or such and you can easily compare the nutritional values, no matter how big or small size you get.  Stop using "serving size". There is no such thing.
They ran out of ideas
Found a super snickers in Ukraine 😂 2 big ass snickers inside
This just makes me sick. Im disgusted in my own country.
They missed the Snickers Protein we have in England. They're sooo good.
snickers crisp is here in ausrtalia too. its the only snickers i enjoy
Can u do Mars bars
I get a chalky taste at the end from American chocolate but my British chocolate is silky smooth, delicious
Man which restaurant is this??
Bring back the Marathon
日本の食や文化をYOUTUBEで発信しているジュンジローと申します。いつも楽しく動画拝見させていただいてます。撮影や編集の仕方とても勉強になります！次回の動画も楽しみにしてます！My name is Junjiro, and I'm a YOUTUBE fan of Japanese food andculture. I always enjoy watching your videos. I learn so much from the way you shoot and edit! I'm looking forward to your next video!
I didn't know Snickers had so many varieties!
Do beast burger plzzzzzzz, we all want it
Great video. Love a snickers bar :))))
Has… has he seen Malcolm in the middle?   *looks down and whispers nice*
it's like the UK is on the 'that' diet in comparison to the US
USA USA USA! fat men's country!!!
You should do a food wars but with cereal
I don’t know why but I feel like it tasted better when it was called Marathon.
I think in 2022 these chocolate bars will get a little thinner but the price will be a little higher ... You think so too?!
Hey, guys. Make reviews about Skittles and M&M's.
No fun size or smaller Snickers in the Uk? They’re excellent for Halloween or anytime really.
Am I the only one that wants to get a dozen of snickers now?
The UK guy picked the worst chocolate bar ( for me at least)
you guys should do this with Australia aswell
Can you guys do Lay's next?
explains why 99% of people die in the usa because of obesity
Hello
The blue Snickers bars are horible
Please do John's incredible Pizza Food wars
I need to travel, second video I've seen today saying other countries have better candy than the US. Im curious now!
UK chocolate is superior in every way to our chocolate here in the US.
There's white choc snickers in the UK now. I think it's limited time only
Why is the share size bag smaller than the grab n go bag?
Mini goes really well with a tea  Yes, very British I know
I love the two hosts on this channel would love to have a pint with either of them and compare. Lol
10% chocolate liquor? I'll drink to that.
Loved the video - UK Chocolate is amazing and I think you guys should make a video comparing UK chocolate brands like dairy milk to US brands - I know it’s been done but you’re so funny it would make a great video
We do have the fun size snickers in the UK - only really comes out in october for halloween, not usually available the rest of the year
8:18 Nice nod to Rick and Morty
So everything bad for you taste better outside the US
They Should Do Reeses Next
Do Twix next
That Vomity taste is On purpose..... GOOGLE IT
Snickers is my fav!
I think the main difference is not the portion sizes, but how many bars are in a bag. The bag sizes are ridiculous in the US.
UK doesn’t want to become A fat country that’s why the  chocolate’s is small
i think is beacause of the artificial flavors ...
Couple years ago here in Poland we had limited special version of Snickers, Snickers Hazelnut! Those were so delicious and unfortunately available for very short time :/
They should do a twix episode next
We do have fun size snickers, they come in bags and are available in most supermarkets.  Also, I may have missed it, but I didn't see the white chocolate snickers, which is by far my favourite.
Do lays potato chips
We have a white chocolate snickers, protein snickers bars and powder and tiny snickers in the box of ‘celebrations’ in the UK as well
We also have snickers protein bars in the uk
1:00 on behalf of everyone not in the US, WHAT is that?! You want to cosplay as a Borrower?!
In India we have only 1 Snickers bar which is not available mostly in the shops 😅😅. Any ways we could order from Amazon
Food Insider.....how about a US vs USA Cadbury food war for a future video?
We also have a Snickers White Chocolate bar here in the UK. It's not bad but really rich.
Isn't there a Snickers Oats or something like that also..??
I thought here in the UK we also had frozen ice cream style Mars bars and snickers as well
5:00 GOD SAVE OUR QUEEN
Hey, Food Insider. I want you to make a video called “ US vs UK Energy Drinks | Food Wars” one day.
@Joe Avella how are you my man?
You should compare them with Indian snickers too if it's any change,  BTW I enjoy Joe being funny and natural at same point
This video should be titled "When you run out of video ideas"
fr if snickers just made an originial chocoloate bar with some.. pink in the packaging i would buy it
Love the revelation that UK / EU chocolate is so much greater than US
I tried once hersheys chocolate and it was so disgusting I thought it may have been expired lol.  Now I hear about the vomit aftertaste and it was exacty what I felt... How can americans eat that?!?! Lmao
They have officially run out of restaurants
I LIVE SNIKERS
Do a Japanese kitkat  episode
Is there a Cadbury chocolate video here?
Poland is, I believe, in the best spot when it comes to Snickers. Because they get literally everything that both US and UK have. They don't have only the Giga-Bar that US has.
Mr t is pleased
If world peace achived All wars stopped Including food wars.
do tim horton
DORITOS NEXT
MAN THE UK PEOPLE EAT REALLY SMALL SNICKERS TEAM USA! FREEDOM AND SNICKERS!
Where is the snicker drink?
Can anyone help me by giving laptop for my online class 🙏🇮🇳
These wars are not even wars , snickers is an American brand .
Not a fan of snickers but snickers almond is pretty good, much better than the regular version.
I'm glad I live in the U.S.
I would love to give the Snickers "bites" a try and will look!
yo
Well that explains the 89kg average weight in America
UK chcocolate is so better than United states chcocolate I'm sorry USA
Usa   best ❤   i like  usa snickers  better  .  My opinion
I have tried British chocolate as well as chocolate from other countries and they generally are better than the American versions.  I grew up with Hershey's chocolate, but once I tried chocolate from Britain, Germany, and Belgium, Hershey seems kind of lame.
You forgot that the US also have snickers ice cream bars
You guys (us) have white choc snickers too, I’ve had them before bought them online, they’re amazing
hey harry it  NUGET
Uk forgot the little snickers in the celebrations chocolates! 😍
There is really no functional difference between UK and US chocolate in terms of any kind of fat or coca content in general, claims that's the case are largely baseless. Those are the expensive bits, so the UK companies trim them down to the bare minimum just as hard. So claiming it's smoother or richer is straight up placebo regarding mass market products. The only real notable difference is that in the US a method persevering milk which adds a mildly sour undertone came to predominate early on and the population grew accustomed to that, so it continued and was adopted by the industry as a whole.   Other then that any claims about quality are just straight up baseless snobbery.
Why do I watch these videos at 1AM
What about the Snickers ice cream (I had one today)?
Keep these videos rolling ❤️❤️❤️
I'm in Australia and I never really thought too much about Snickers bars before. I'm about to do food shopping and now my mind is going to be all on Snickers and the sizes and grams and what flavours we have here. I'm going to be so distracted on what I need to get because all I'll be thinking about is Snickers. Cheers, hahahaha
I normally pronounce it nougat
I’m from the US, and I can’t stand the taste of Hersheys chocolate of any kind! I need to have the European chocolate if I’m gonna have any at all! It is so much richer sweeter and just all-around better than American chocolate!
the “…69. nice.” got me lol
UK does have fun size ! also celebrations size!
Brit guy says "candy bar". Imposter! You are no brit, sir! 😁
The US version has more sugar, fat and salt but tastes worse. Typical.
Really want a snickers now! 😋
Harry: Noogart or Noogert, Me: Nugget
Wow ok someone didn’t do the research. The UK has small versions in the celebrations tubs, also we have a fun size normally found most places around Halloween time, snickers protein & also snickers white which was a ‘limited edition’ but is still around. Also steering away from the bar side there is snickers flapjacks & snickers milkshakes.
The wicked development intraoperatively hate because patch symptomatically cheer modulo a shiny tendency. previous, hushed rail
Please start to compare the taste more often, loved that part ^^
What happen to the snickers ice cream?
I like Snickers. In fact I'd go and far to say it's the best of them all.
You forgot the snickers protein bar
Joe it looks like your eating a burrito there
For the love of god nobody even in the US eats Hershey's without mixing it with something else
6:47 Forget the one pound fish... here it is, the one pound SNIKERS 💥.
I remember trying to find regular mars bars not the dark chocolate version and I found out they discounted it and replaced it with the snickers almond. It isn’t the same...
Also, snickers protein, snickers ice cream, mini snickers in celebrations and yeah... fun sized snickers... in pound land.
You got a comment just for "little bits"
I miss my Canadian/US chocolate. The stuff in the UK is OK on taste but the sizes are getting so small it's just wrong. Soon the UK normal size is going to be the size of the Halloween ones. I need more of my Canadian/US chocolate
Bro could have gone to cvs for snickers bites
The english man is super close mind but the US man is open mind and objective👌🏼
As an Australian.. I find US chocolate tastes like drywall mixed with baby poweder... whereas UK chocolate tastes weird... Australian and NZ chocolate are the best.  Belgium chocolate melts too easy.
When i was studying in the US, i used to bring kitkat boxes with me! The US version is just too sweet and lacks flavor! Surprising cuz i thought the origin will be tastier!
1.69g NICE
Nougat was pronounced nugget by my grandparents and I've heard it like that in some old adverts, so nugget it is for me.
I think adulthood is knowing you're gonna get sick from something and doing it anyway. 😆💀
You should do a comparison of other products in the line up. In the UK you can buy a Snickers Milk Drink as well as Snickers Ice Cream so I presume the same products exist in the US too. Maybe a comparison of the UK versions of Snickers, Mars Bar etc. drinks and ice creams against their US equivalents.
Scraping the barrel now 😂😂😂
what about the Ice Cream and the 'Shake drinks?
And anyway, the proper name is a Marathon bar.  At least here in the UK, it was.
you forgot the snickers ice cream bar in the uk
9:42 i laughed so hard
I love snickers!
Can u do all chocolate videos like Hersey and kinder
Well you already know that I am booking that flight to the UK right away to get a chocolate bar.
Do a video about US vs UK Twix | Food Wars! Please!!!
It’s a sexy one pound bar! My eyes did this 😍😍😍😍 And I’m expected to share?? NOOO 🤪 Get your own bar son, this is mine! Also, mini bites… I got them at Target. I was home just three months ago so, I hope that helps. Amazon was charging you a lot because they come in bulk size. This was a good and fair comparison. Keep up the great work 🧡🧡
69 nice joke tho😂
I can count on my hands how many times I've eaten snickers.
Mr. Beast Burger plsssssssssssss
Show the lithium mines in one of those electric car commercials.
Harry gives off some serious  Tina Belcher vibes
The super satin notablely tease because turkey preclinically pour barring a historical staircase. faithful, daffy brush
The best UK version is the white chocolate snickers!
I noticed the same about US chocolate travelling there from Australia. Australia’s chocolate is so much nicer! Sorry US! Another great episode lads
It would be cool if u did mrbeast burger
Why is the English guy saying ‘candy bar’ ?!
obese us at it again
In the UK, the manufacturers agreed to get rid of the king size chocolate bars to reduce calories, then came out with the duo bars which had more calories but they were for "sharing"
India also has thier own Snicker falvors example: cashew, pistachio, half milk chocolate half dark chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, we also have caramel, strawberries, and last but not least......... protein bar, yes india has all of these exclusive flavours there might be some that I missed
Guys the smaller Snickers are probably for kids, Snickers are also consumed by kids I mean come on you and I both know that no parent is crazy enough to give thier kid a adult sized Snicker bar so.......there's your answers the company made smaller sizes for kids
I love this series mannn
Yes size does matter in most of the chocolate!!🤭 Because a single bar will lasted about a minute or 2 minutes in a half then its gone!🤭💀
itS prOnouNced NouGat🤷‍♂️, how did he want us to tell him😂
The US peanut butter Snickers is my favourite, I just wish they weren’t so expensive here in the UK!
My friend from America sent me some chocolate. It was so terrible. It tastes like sick.
A Brit said "candy bar"? It's a chocolate bar, mate!
It's weird to hear "grams" in american accent, it's like do they even know what it means? Lol
The reason that US chocolate has an acidic kinda "vomity" flavour is because the US uses soured milk in it's chocolate making process.
American chocolate tastes disgusting
Food Wars was the only reason I subscribed to this channel
"I am going to be so sick tonight" 🤣 🤣 Me all the time
American eat those high calories food as if they have free healthcare
KNEW git
I seem to remember another missing bar. I don’t know if it was discontinued, but the us had a delicious snickers ice cream bar.
In India we have Almond and cashew based Snickers🤣
5:22 what did I just hear😱😱😱
Everything is plus size in the US, including ppl!!!!🤦‍♂️
Quite ironic how the US version of Snickers looks like it has the British flag on its packaging.
The Lil Bits reference was S tier
I kind of want them to do a biscuit + cookie comparison where A) they explain the difference between the two in the UK and B) they just brag about all our nice UK biscuits? (Not Nice as in the biscuits that say nice on them, I mean just biscuits that taste nice.) Mcvities Digestives, hob nobs, malt, nice, rich tea, jammy dodges, jaffa cakes (which I actually don't like), party rings, ect.
❤❤❤👍
they probably won't see this but a suggestion for another place to compare is Auntie Anne's
we definitely have fun size bags of snickers in the uk? or maybe they just release them around halloween and they’re not a year round thing idk
We do have fun size snickers in the UK they come in family favourites bags sold in most supermarkets
I really do love the editing in these videos
What about the small sneakers you get in a tub of Celebrations
I thought we did have fun size in the UK
but but but...  where is the WHITE chocolate snickers bar sold here in the netherlands... don't you UK peeps have that? as well as a box of celebrations.. that includes very tiny bitsize snickers amongst all the other things.. (sometimes also known as a snickers mini.. though to make things confusing snickers mini is also sold in a bag .. and is somewhere between the normal bar size and the celebrations size) and ofcourse the snickers HiProtain bar (with 20 grams of protain in it instead of the normal 5 and much less sugar) (both in normal chocolate and the white chocolate variation) and ofcourse snickers ice cream bar.. (where the nogat is replaced for icecream).. found in the frozen section..
If anyone wants to know why america is such an obese country look no further than these videos 👍
White snickers in U.K. are amazing.
Joe needs to try the UK Cadbury Dairy Milk Chocolate bar. Make sure it’s from the UK and not the US version. It’s a game changer
There have been some great limited editions in the UK. There was an amazing hazlenut one, one with extra caramel and one with extra peanuts.  Theres also been a pecan one in the US and a 'More chocolate' one in germany i think
You can buy the 1kg Snickers here in the UK, but only at Christmas. Same goes for a huge Kitkat, Toblerone (1.2kg) and Milky Bar (may be others, but their the ones i've seen). Snickers did at one point sell a white chocolate bar but I think it vanished after like 2 months (perhaps limited edition? I don't know)
The UK also has a white chocolate one!
this video is pretty gnarly
I totally understand when he said that he gets a weird vomity taste from American chocolate, I especially get that from, well, Hershey bars.
Whoever edited the rabbit in is a genius
I swear to god there is also an exclusive white chocolate snickers (for the UK 🇬🇧) I’ve tried it before...
As a wise man once said: why are americans eating like they have free healthcare
the one you get in the celebrations tub us the smallest UK bar
I came here just to say the snickers ice cream bars are just amazing
Yeahhhhhh
Interesting video 👍
I'm American I prefer UK chocolate creamier without the sour note US chocolate has
Ever tasted norwegian milk chocplate from freia? Ye its the best by far.
Do Pringles next!
UK Snickers also contain mushed up or blended up Snickers in the nougat part to give it that unique flavour and colour
I want a slice and share!!!!
This video is interesting but why am i more intrigued about that comb over haircut the British reporter is rocking?
youre forgetting the UK snickers protein bars!
I remember in the UK, in the 90s the King size version. Actually thought they were better the regular size.
I just love snickers
Omg I want that big snickers 😢😢😢
Now i want a cut and share snickers bar but im not gonna cut and share
Can definitely get Fun Size Snickers in the UK in the lead up to Halloween.
You mean Marathon bars? :D
I, always keep an emotional support Snickers in my weedinet ... Also in the US we had a Snickers espresso bar hard to find.
you can get the snicker share bag bites to.
You missed the Snickers marathon
People: compare usa and uk chocolate  Nobody: .... UK: signature look of superiority
Next is skittles!
Food Wars: Estrella Chips next?
If u are gonna do snickers you should do oreos
Snickers Ice Cream Bar is missing, does it still count???
I'm an american and Hersheys has always had a weird aftertaste. I simply hate their chocolate that they produce.
Uk lose as always
Can you guys make a similar video for twix too??  Pleasee
both of them just personality-wise feel like what we think of their perspective country
Do kitkat
Hey, we've got Snickers in Australia too. You should do an episode with US vs UK vs Australia products! I'm more than happy to post them to you!
Anyone else got a craving for snickers now or just me?
Surely you mean Marathon, right?
Do Buffalo wild wing
In the US I'm pretty sure they use a chemical that's also found in vomit, which is why it taste like that.
first time I m seeing UK outdoing USA in a food war XD
They’ve forgotten the snickers protein bar
I’m gonna go buy a snickers now :)
Still wating for more fast food Chemistry.
Curious why a snickers fruit and nut isn't a thing like we already know fruit and nut works add Carmel 😘😂 make this happen in Australia haha as a trial 😂
You should do KitKat bcz the one here in the US made by Hershey and its an abomination I was shocked when I tried it first time I got here, since that day I just order the UK Nestle KitKat from Amazon or buy it in some European stores here
yum
Mars was invented in Great Britain don’t know about the sneakers
Hershey's is the worst of US chocolate. Ghirardelli is a better US chocolate. There are of coarse loads of US fancy chocolates, and loads of UK fancy chocolates. A fancy chocolate comparison would be cool.
Waiting for lays ❤️❤️🔥
American people thinks their healthcare is free
UK has the crisp version!!! Man I miss those!!!
69 Me: nice
Now I want to taste a "European" or "UK" Snickers bar!!!
Usa portion sizes are bigger than uk and usa peple are eating lot of poison more than uk people(im talking about every videos)
I've also found a snickers protein bar in the UK. We also have snickers ice cream.
@sidemenreacts
You can Get sneakers almond in India as well its not native to the US
For once, the UK proportions are actually larger than the US's 🤔
Your missing the Snickers Ice cream :(
You're slipping. You missed the Hazelnut  one, which is the best. Also the white one.
Did he whisper “nice” on his junior? Haha.
So Kit Kat in the US has finally been branching out, where does the UK stand on a scale with the US on one end and Japan on the other?
I can't believe that Snickers manufactures a 1-pound snickers rod and expects us to divide it into sixteen equal fun sizes without even trying to pre-mold the portions it holds. As God is my witness, never in a million years, no one, absolutely no one, would ever share that log after opening the package.
USA is the best!
Scandalous- no 'fun size' bars in the UK?!? How do you describe your smaller women???
I'm beginning to think that people in the UK would be just as overweight as the people in the US if their portion sizes were equal.
69     *N i c e*
Candy/sugary stuff in the us tastes sooo different
So glad ur back!😩😩👌👌👌
I like that he judged a chocolate for it being tempored with a gloss on it lol. Yea I'm sure that uk is better, but it was just a tempered Chocolate full of chemicals.
A Snicker is a "scornful laugh; a snigger" which is a pretty stupid name for a chocolate bar by any stretch of the imagination. What is being eaten here are Marathons and my veto (commenced in UK in 1990) of these bars will continue until the rightful name is restored!
Snickers White Chocolate?! no?!.... okay.
It’s sad that they just don’t make all their chocolates like the UK.
(UK) I remember in the mid to late 90's there was a limited edition Snickers bar that was larger than the King Size that they did, I can't remember what they called it tho, I keep thinking "Hunger Buster" for some reason.
In the uk we do get fun size snickers inside the ‘family favourites’ bags which are usually only bought around Halloween or to give out on birthdays at primary school.
You forgot about the Snickers ice cream bar. Yum!
Vomiting sensation. Yass! Exactly. Someone teach Americans to make chocolate!
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
For the UK, you missed out the snickers protein bar and also the snickers ice cream bar. We also have snickers flapjack bars
We have Snickers fun size, i used to buy them all the time at Christmas.
You could make a video comparing napkins and would still watch it
What about the Snickers Ice Cream Bar?
Bro,literally the snickers for 16 people looks like one of those small but long cakes that you would buy on the supermarket 😮!
Just spell SNICKERS whiteout "S" 🙂🙂
Fun Size Snickers is available in the UK in packs of 13. They have been available for decades.
Nah that slice and share is for me and me only Ill slice and share it with myself 😌 May take me a week or 2 but its still for me
Is it just me, or does the UK crisp Snickers sound a bit like a Whatchamacallit?
American Chocolate is made with Butyric Acid which comes from Lipolysis on Milk. The lipolysis makes the milk go sour and last longer which in turn also makes American Chocolate last longer. The Butyric Acid gives off the vomit taste to a lot of Europeans. Butyric Acid is found in vomit but also in other foods like Parmesan cheese.
American "chocolate" tastes like the devil's ass. Avoid.
Us vs UK Ben and jerrys
Do KitKat!
Food Insider 2040: UK vs USA Clouds
Food Insider 2035: UK vs USA Oxygen
Further confirmation of what we all knew already - US chocolate sucks when compared to any non-US / European chocolate.
The editing in this one was hilarious as always. These videos keep getting better!
Confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart Jesus died on the cross for your sins, was buried, and was raised from the dead on the 3rd day.  Please get saved before it is too late. God bless you all in Jesus name.❤
We also have a white chocolate one at b & m
Boys we have really run out of ideas havent we?  Still a good video either way tho
Snickers Almond isn't US exclusive, I've seen it before in Home Bargains/Quality Save over the years.
In the U.K. we do have the almond one and what about snickers ice cream bars 😱😱
I live in the US and I didn’t know we had the one pound Snickers😂
There's definitely fun size in bags in the UK... Not more fun!
I remember at one point in the uk you could get a almond or a caramel one I think??
Uk chocolate > us chocolate :)
Next do skittles
As I am from the uk..i only knew of a few lol
What about the snickers ice cream bar in the UK It is heavenly
I'm watching this while eating Snickers duo 😃
We do have fun size snickers in the UK too. They also have a snickers protein bar too
These guys are running out with ideas
surprised to see there was no snickers white, since i've seen them in some places here in my country
what did he say???
I have a question did a uk or American person start this channel
Do kit cat next
i like milky way better then that
Please make video about kit kat!
Who would watch this shit content
No one in the UK calls them candy bars
wonder why america has such high obesity rates
I always disliked hersheys. Texture and taste didn’t seem like real chocolate. Always preferred dove or other European chocolate brands.
Marathon 😕
I knew that I'm not crazy!!! After moving to US from UK so many foods taste worse :(
I suppose all the fast food is done.
In India we get cashew and almond snickers bar and all our snickers are vegetarian, the Indian chocolate is much richer than the western one as we use buffalo milk an in India the biggest single bar come for 85 cents
So the uk get hold of US exclusives, that the US don't even acknowledge exist because they don't mention them.
In the uk you can get snickers protein powder💪
There is a hare on there. So whimsical. I still laughed
rain.
Do a US vs UK Ben & Jerry's ice cream!
The US also has snickers ice cream 🤤
How much dang insider channels are there
I am so jealous of the US people. When I went to NYC, 3 years ago, I brought 11 flavors of Pringles We just have like 4 here in Brazil. (And 2 sizes very similars of snickers)
Food Insider 2030: UK vs US Soil.
I thought the uk has the snickers protein bar as well!
I had us chocolate but I never went to the uk
Adam Ragusea has a video on why American chocolate "tastes like vomit". really good video
We used to have Snickers flapjacks in the UK. Can’t find one for love nor money now.  Loved them.
Nice ^_^
The big us one i can snack on it in a gaming night with the boys
I feel so poor right now
I was waiting for Joe to attempt to cut up the  giant bar into the 16 pieces needed for the portion size
Littte bits 😂 good old Rick and Morty.
I have tried both and UK is hands down better
US chocolate is hands down the worst chocolate you can buy. The chocolate itself is bland and grainy and the vomit aftertaste is real. I feel sorry for anyone who actually thinks it's good
You missed the Limited Edition White Snickers bar we have in the UK.
in the UK you can get white snickers too!
Running out of ideas huh
8:18 LIL' BITSSSSSSSSS
I wonder what artificial flavours the us has not telling uou what exactly ?
The novelty time-limited versions of regular candy products are almost always composed of lower quality ingredients, like a lower % of chocolate and peanut dust, rather than the thicker chocolate and larger chunks of peanut you'd find in a normal bar.  It's done this way to cynically maximize profit, since people have been shown to happily fork out once or twice for a novel flavor and never buy it again, yet it does no harm to the sales of the regular product.
Us chocolate suckssss
I swear I've heard this music track on Bon Appetit
Hershey’s has butyric acid in which is a chemical found  in vomit which gives it its taste.
I don't care about the sizes I just want to eat them🤤😁😅
Y is he upset about the 100 calorie bar. That's all u should b eating. Nothing more coz it would b then b well over your daily sugar limit. Having bigger candy bars is not a win. U lose your health and the chemicals that r in it are as artificial as it gets.
I think we can end this whole series now, the UK has won the taste test.
Love these videos - please don't stop making them
Snickers are the bomb 💣!!  🎇
Marathon….  They’ll always be Marathon Bars 🤦🏻‍♂️🤪
In Australia we have snickers to and I personally do like it we may not have every range of Snickers the U.S and U.K do but we have quite a few varieties…
I think I can call myself a chocolate expert. I have eaten lots of diffrent types of chocolate, I live near the Belgian-Dutch border so I have eaten  a lot of Belgian chocolate which is superior because is had more cocoa. I also live in the Netherlands where we eat chocolate sprinkles for breakfast so. And yes, chocolate from the USA tastes kind of weird sometimes.
Might offend some people but hershey's chocolate tastes ug and smells like vomit sorry but
Please do kitkat
9:45 gross
Now they are finally doing candy the only thing we needed
No Harry!!! You called the Snickers a CANDY BAR! Usually you’re true to our British terminology. Chocolate bar 😀. NOT candy bar!
The best (creamiest & so much chocolate flavour) milk chocolate is Tony’s Chocolonely’s. I never want to eat any other milk chocolate ever again ❤️❤️
It’s all fun and games until they try Australian Snickers/Chocolate
There are also snicker high protein for those who are body builders
I love Snickers.
Snickers is my ride or die here in Australia. Tried it in the USA and couldn't get through half of it.... That weird grainy, artificial and almost expired chocolate taste was not good.  You put Americans are missing out on the good UK/Australian stuff
Malaysia have the snickers oats bar
Reese’s next!
This people have the best job in the world If you ask me, this is what I wanna do when I'll be at the right age to get a job.
make a Oreo video too
Next suggestion: Kit-Kat (UK) pit against Kit-Kat (US).
Anyone who doesn’t like snickers here ?
What about Snickers ice cream?
Snicker ice cream bars are amazing
American chocolate is really odd
Kit kat or hersheys next!
You can literally get snickers bites on instacart for 2 dollars.
I just realized I never tasted US chocolate
Just ate snickers
Why are these videos still being made? We get it, we're fat!
Yassss.... what I've been waiting for!!!💪🏽
Israel is the only place that double bars not poplar but long bar is really is
This is a US chapter
6:26 i agree
453g WHAT!?!! Though honestly a lot of the differences in quality could probably just be due to differences in quality control, though materials used are also quite important.
American companies making better products for the foreigners bc they have higher standards and regulations…. thanks 🤦🏻‍♀️
I just want to appreciate the editor 😂
Omgggg yes! The vomity aftertaste with the choco in here in America, glad I’m not the only one, most chocolates here leave that taste to me unless they are expensive
Wjy do you guys keep calling a kcal a calorie? That's a kilo calorie or the energy needed to heat 1000 ml of water by 1°C
Do kit kat next pls
I remember there was Snickers with sunflower seeds instead of peanuts
Please do japan kitkat vs us kitkat vs uk kitkat.
I seriously love this series on the channel. A little suggestion, maybe compare the prices as well.
Great, now I want a UK peanut butter Snickers.
There's no almond or cashew snickers in us/uk?
why doesn't the US just copy the UK's candy bar if it's that much better?
I hoped they would also include the other non-candy Snickers products - ice cream, shake, etc.  For another Food Wars ep. maybe?
American chocolate is garbage. European chocolate is million times when better.
I gonna buy sneakers in my country and want to check the ingredients. Wondering same like which country. 😏
Oh how the mighty have fallen...
you guys are reaching for comparos!   i'll keep watching <3
I want the 1 lb snickers bar..for myself. The perfect blend of fat, sugar, and protein.
Do Cadbury next!!!
3:31 joe the corn
US chocolate is truly trash compared to UK or Swiss chocolate, I have to go to Canada or to a foreign grocery store in order to get proper chocolate here 😒
6:27 was that Brick Heck from The Middle LMAO 😭
lil bits rick and morty callout was golden!
UK just bias to US candy 🤣🤣.
I never seen a snickers bar that big here in the U.S.
I some times feel like I'm in a science class while watching your videos😅😂
Americans can't taste the vomit after taste and after living here for 21 years I have to really concentrate to tell it's there but it is
When then uk snickers is slightly bigger than the us version Uk guy: nice 😎
The snickers pods in aus are still hands down the most superior of all
6:27  Is this dude talking to the snickers or off camera to something else..? 🤔🤫
This was interesting to watch.
You should do uk & American kitkat vs japan, I bet it would be an hour long video
u forgot : celebration box snickers snickers ice cream snickers protein snickers marathon
Me eating Reese’s while watching this:
Joe went home crying in the corner, hugging his American flag asking why is the UK snickers is better
Lil biiiiitsssss
I do wish Joe had cut up the giant snickers to see what a 16th looked like
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. ,...................
Little bits...
Henry should watch Adam ragusea’s “why Hershey bars taste like vomit “
Fun to watch! You should do a Kit Kat one next. USA has a ton of different ones lately! I know we’re nowhere near close to Japan in flavors lol but still.
We have fun size bars in the UK, and mini ones in Celebration boxes as well as Snickers ice cream bars and protein bars! 😁
Powerade episode please
e
The UK also has the White Snickers...
THAT much single use plastic in front of you guys and you're NOT talking about the packaging?! What's with that?
6:52 says it contains 2080 calories and 130 per serving, how many servings? Cameraman: 8 Me: bruh, 130*10 itself is only 1300
We can get the snickers mini and we have snicker ice cream
So glad I'm from Europe phew
American chocolate is disgusting. I'll take Australian chocolate any day!
No snickers ice cream??
American chocolate tastes really bad. I got a Hershey’s bar for like €4 and I was so disappointed 🥲
U have no idea what you are talking about 🤣 that's just your opinion lol
Gotta do m&ms next. There’s so many varieties and sizes.
What about the tiny sinkers in the celebrations tubs?
Guys we also have a Snickers Ice Cream bar which is lovely
UK chocolate is way better than US chocolate. Better flavour and a lot smoother.
Boo. Joe converts the weight from oz to grams, but on the British side, he doesn't convert grams to oz :(
The closest thing you’ll get to a fun size snicker in the uk are the ones you find in a box of celebrations.
More like Hershey’s
Or Marathon, for the hardcore fans.......
But what about the Snickers ice cream bar?
In the Netherlands we had a limited edition of a white Snickers 🤤 Where did it go...
Uk born and raised here. Made an American friend and begged her to get me some Hersherys since I’d heard so much about- I puked as soon as I’d eaten it. It was disgusting and left an oily coating on my tongue.
The food industry in Europe is generally better with less chemicals are more "real" ingredients.
4:29 I laughed way more than I should have 😂
I love this series!!
Please don’t call the candy, your British! It’s chocolate bars!
US Food is trash quality vol. 2748
Hershey’s & Nestle specific, name, are crap chocolate.  Stick to Dove, Ghirardelli, if you want decent chocolate that’s popular US chocolate
More than 80% of the corn grown in the USA is GMO. Enjoy your GMO Snickers America.
Assuming you have the brands in the UK, you gotta do MnMs, Hershey's, or Reese's next.
UK vs USA m'ms
They don't do fun size Snickers in the UK anymore? I'm sure they used to do them before.
No matter how different they are, together they are a masterpiece
What about snickers ice cream
We need a separate time lapse of Joe eating the whole slice and share by himself.
Didn’t see this coming. 😂
UK is like South africa the stuff is smaller than usa
I'm making it official, I am moving to the UK because they have better chocolate bars
I remember when I was a kid and I got a Hersheys bar from selfridges. I was so excited to try it, and lets say I was not impressed. It got thrown in the bin lmao. I know its what americans are used too but dam, I get nicer chocolate from tesco value
Next is kit kat dubai is the winner
3:45 The reason (at least I'm pretty sure after my extensive 30 minuter research) that our chocolate is different to the chocolate in Europe is because during WWII, soldiers were given an altered version of chocolate that contained Butyric Acid which made it last longer. After the war, the soldiers grew so used to that chocolate, Hershey's (and subsequently all other chocolate) was made to that altered formula.  Hope that helps!
Auntie Anne’s would be an interesting one to do! (Especially on portion sizes)
Omg he actually tasted real chocolate I'm so happy for you bro
Snickers crips are in the US too. I’ve seen them at Walmart
There is a scientific reason for the vomity taste. American  chocolate has butyric acid in it which can also be found in vomit. European chocolate doesn’t have that
Well it doesn't matter because American chocolate sucks 🚶🏻
If you're going to compare the two, at least put the calorie info on the screen at the same time. Do you think we are going to remember all the fat/sugar etc weights to compare in our minds or something?
Little bits.
1.69 oz (nice)
Oohhh ssshhiitt, not just fast food, now food, brill idea
Allergic to nuts yes   Gonna watch this video also yes
Wait u dnt have snickers candy style pack?in uk and us?
Do oreos, the exclusives will be fun!
You can definitely get fun size snickers and bite size snickers in the U.K. in supermarkets. You can get high protein snickers on Amazon and they have some other ones like white chocolate too
I'm sure someone has said this but US milk is transported long distances to the chocolate factories and it needs to be preserved so it doesn't go off. They add in butyric acid to preserve it which can also be found in vomit hence why you get the vomit flavour from a lot of US chocolate.
In the UK we also get those Snickers Bites, although I've not seen them in the last few months.
US manufacturers and chain restaurants know that we’re stupid and we will take far  less superior product then anywhere else in the world.
NOOO PLEASEE DO FAST FOOD
They’re CHOCOLATE bars. You’re BRITISH! 😅
You guys should do one on Denny's. Those exist in the UK and US
What about the Snickers Protein bars here in the UK? Has anyone else tried these or have I been seeing things?
Addendum to the video, for those who are interested in Snickers: Snickers exists in an ice cream bar variant in the US, too, with possibly some more ice cream variants.
I think they forgot the ones you find in the little celebration boxes 😂😂😂
Can you do a Coffee Crisp comparison, or a Kit Kat, Oh Henry?  I guess Canadian bars are classified as US. We should have our own tasting against the UK and US, hehe he
Maltesers please!!!
Hersheys bars are terrible chocolate. I stopped eating them when I had to stop eating dairy, and I will never go back. I would taste an original recipe Hershey bar though.
Mars next
Lol no one has the trio snickers ?what a shame.   Edit: or white snickers ?
I get that vomit aftertaste as well from American chocolate. I thought it was gone off, but apparently all US chocolate tastes like that. America needs to up its chocolate game.
Of course th u.s.a would have a snickers the size of a forearm
Aoaoaoaoaoao
They should've done things like the snickers ice creams, milkshakes and proteins bars too! Would've been a good addition to the episode
0:55 That eyebrow raise: as if you're going to share it fatty 😂😂
You Guys Should Do Soda(Example: Coca-cola, Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Dr.Pepper Etc)
UK accent is irritating tbh, can't understand what he is trying to say please change
I totally want a UK Snickers now
Harry why didn't you have the white chocolate version?? Granted it is limited but I've been getting it for a while now in South London. Its just your classic snickers but in white chocolate. That said it is smaller than the classic. Also Joe we do have fun/bite size but they usually come in a box or tub of celebrations.
Reeses nutragious bar is better than all Snickers bars.
The almond butter snickers is amazing. So is the white chocolate snickers
Where's Snickers ice-cream?!
Some American: "No, we don't have diabetes problems" Also them:Taken 5 regular size Snickers per day
Nougat is pronounced as NOO/GUT
I ❤️ this show!!! Damn you can see how us Americans don’t care about how big our candy is!!!😂🤣😅😬
Does the Snickers crispy in the UK count as a Snickers?
Skittles would probably work with this format
Did you miss out the UK snickers protein bar?   I enjoy these but would love UK version of the giant share bar.
There's actually also a protein snickers bar in the uk
What happened to the dark chocolate snickers??
american chocolates are shite
They have snickers protein bars at the M and S near me
do lion bars next!!!
8:17 Rick and Morty reference
European chocolate is fantastic! American chocolate is way too sweet and almost always seems to have corn syrup and/or HFCS in it. Even Ghirardelli switched to HFCS in their squares! It might cost more, but EU chocolate is far and away the best chocolate!!
One of my favorite sweet snacks is an Almond Snickers & a Dr. Pepper. It enhances the almond taste and almost tastes like Amaretto. Also, I miss the Hazelnut Snickers we had for a while.
Welcome to another episode of why Americans are overweight.
What if the “s” in snickers was silent, this video would be interesting.
You’re not you when you’re hungry” Joe: *bites snickers and turns into Harry* Better? *_better_*
omgg may favorite snackbar 😍❤️
US vs U.K. Coca-Cola !
In the UK you can get a white snickers bar from a post office store
There’s a snickers white chocolate
I love snickers
Wth is wrong with the usa? Have they no food standards? I live near a NATO air base of mostly usa personal, they always say that the food outside of usa tastes 10 times better... only thing i would eat at this point in the usa is wild game meat if i ever visit...
Please do M&Ms next
9:55 The caramel has a bit more thermos to it...
The almond butter one is soooo good!! I can’t eat it again, though because of dairy. *makes sad face*
Pls make more parts of chocolates or snacks it is a great concept
Snickers Slice 'n Share in my mind translates to "duty-free size"
I want to try a U.K. Snickers bar now.
Hey Harry, that glossiness on the Hersheys is due to tempering, dummy
ASK THE FANS OF THIS SHOW WHAT WE WANT TO SEE NEXT !  We all love this series and both you guys and your editors NO matter what you guys do your  entertaining  ✌️
Whoever was doing research on the UK end is slacking. We also have Snickers White Chocolate, Snickers Hazelnut & Snickers Protein bars. Plus, Celebration boxes contain bite size Snickers bars.
Candy bar in the UK, what happened to chocolate.
The bloke needs to try a filthy slab from of dairy milk he’ll just orgasm
Please do Hard Rock Cafe 🍔. Wish you the best ❤️
Patatos
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Я перестал  покупать и есть  Snickers  в составе  которое есть пальмовое масло .
Please do an episode on all the Kinder products!
There is one type of snickers in the UK, and it's called Marathon.
Of course UK chocos are better, they're first to invented it and they will never cut corners on something great.
Watching this regretting never trying out american candy when i went to the us!
Maybe kitkat or oreo next?
These regional comparisons never cease to horrify me. As a Canadian whose consumer commodities are determined by the American market, I find the North American indifference to health and well-being disgusting.
no Wendy’s, No Popeyes, No Cook out yet I hope it comes soon
Finally I was trying to see this video and they said that it was unavailable. But now I can watch.
Joe really enjoyed our UK snicker
8:36 damn harry said that with much confidence
You forgot snickers ice cream bars. They are the same size as a normal snickers bar, but the nougat is replaced with vanilla ice cream.
Love Snickers😊😊  This made me rush to the corner store to get some.   Great video.
Time for snack wars
When Joe took a bite out of that giant bar... Ugh, excuse me while I vomit a little bit.
I think you should do a chiquetos comparison (not sure ig there is one therenbut i hope there is). Also a nougat comparison (my favourite is the pink/white or chocolate covered nougat). Xx
What about the little snickers you get in the celebrations boxes
Yesss, now we even have chocolates in food wars, so happppy.
there r definitely more varieties in the us than they showed and we have the uk one in the blue package with the crunchies roo, we call it snicker cruncher, and i believe theres a hazlenut, a creemy pb, sweet and salty, sweet and hot, white chocolate, and isnt there one in an orangy red package
Crispy snickers is the best one for me yet  It's like a crispy galaxy and snickers together Ps.the only difference is that the us mix their chocolate with a chemical to increase shelf life that is similar to a chemical in vomit knew from tiktok.
Japan's cacao strong variant is the best Snickers variant for me. Would love to try the brownie variant too. 😁
The chocolate itself is different due to some of the processes that is to keep the chocolate longer and it actually started during WW1 or WW2
😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒❎ Like watching paint dry
European chocolate for the win.
Yeah, here in Europe we have better chocolate bars than in the US, this video confirms it.
69 Nice
The hare in there made me laugh far more than it should, but thank you for making me smile :)
No snicker pods?
You forgot the icecream snickers bars!!
American chocolate sucks. All European chocolates are better, smoother, and chocolatier.  American chocolate has barely any chocolate
I Think Might Be Forget The Ice Cream Version Of The Snickers Bar
yes more of this reese next
Here in Germany we also have white chocolate Snickers, Snickers ice cream, from the company and self-made in ice cream parlours, a Snickers milk drink, and Snickers in an assortment called "Celebrations" in which all Mars company bars are made in candy size.
Hershey's is the worst chocolate into he world
Amazing
Snickers are so gross
New idea is ice cream or cake
I don’t really eat candy because I never really likes it all that much. Maybe it’s because American candy just sucks 🤷🏼‍♂️
Harry needs to try ghirardelli chocolate
You miss Snickers protein
Finally  a food wars involving candy instead of restraunts
Now I wanna try UK vomit apparently I’ve been missing out
I am probably wrong but I pronounce it 'Nugget' instead of 'Noogar'
Their backs must really hurt from carrying this whole channel
Please never stop this show. These hosts are absolutely awesome, and love the content. Y'all got a perfect formula here!
I’m surprised that the Celebrations size Snickers weren’t in the UK bits, I know you can’t buy them individually, but they do very much exist.
Uk ❤️😍
Uk is much better when it comes to chocolate.
👍🤤🤤👌
Who else is curious to know if Joe actually did end up getting sick after all those Snickers??? (I hope not 🤞🏼)
Literally *anyone* will win against the US in the candy department lol
Can you please do a Kit Kat food wars
Why do I watch these when I am neither from UK nor US? 😂❤ Although I realized most of our products are from UK Love from Pakistan ✌✨
Hershey's chocolate is horrible. I don't understand how anyone can eat that crap, and I grew up on it like everyone else. By the time you are an adult, you should be able to tell how bad it is.
US may have better sinckers put uk have better   commerical
We have snickers fruit and nut here in India which I think is an unholy abomination of flavours
9:45 shoutout to the editor 😂👏
Yo dog you missed the white chocolate snicker.
What about the mini snickers in the Celebrations box?
You guys should do Hershey's bar next
Do doritos next plz
...next, Oreo
10:45 When you realize this bar has more veins than yours...
Fun fact: The vomit taste from Hershys is actually from the Butyric Acid.  It is also generated in our stomach. So you know why it tastes like vomit.
Snickers
Not me wanting to go buy a Snickers bar now...
Ran out of restraunts huh?
Why isn’t there a Costa one yet?
How about Skittles can be consider an idea.
Skittles next
''Maybe we should do a food wars candy bars episode'' - Joe in the Christmas special
I got something to tell you        I don’t like snickers
Only the US are enough crazy to have that (im not gonna call u america, thats your continent, not country)
i said this before but there really milking this series now
Realy always fun to see the Food War 😀
In the UK, there are brownie energy snicker bars. In b and m I saw them,
Dear Food Insider  and anyone reading i hope all is well. I just want to say that Jesus Christ loves and cares for you. If you haven't done so please accept Him as your savior and Lord. And remember to enjoy and cherish all that is good and right in life for we only get one life and we don't know what tomorrow will bring.
It's noog-it, not noog-ott
Seeing Harry in that jacket whilst it's the hottest day of the year as of writing this makes me suffer inside
The US Chocolate has Butyric acid in it which is one of our stomach acids and that's why to Europeans US Chocolate tastes like vomit
what about our tiny Celebrations Snickers?!
Remember when everyone sprained their vaginas and called Harry a personality black hole in the earlier UK food videos
Stay fat US!
Snickers are my favourite candy 🍬
I hope this series will never , unfortunately it will
The editor needs a raise
You die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain, a line that will soon describe Food Wars.
Pls do Haribo next
It's just embarrassing seeing the British guy say candy. Grow a pair of balls mate and call them by their proper name.
Just in general the uk is Better
Here's the story on the sour notes in American chocolate: Milton Hershey already had a successful line of caramel candies when he toured Europe. It was there that he tried the first inexpensive shelf-stable milk chocolate bar. Milk chocolate existed before then but was extremely expensive. After one bite, he knew that milk chocolate was the future of candy. So when he got back to the US, he sold his caramel candy factory and founded a new company town (Hershey PA). He started building factories to make milk chocolate in the US right away. This was a little crazy since he didn't actually know how to mass produce milk chocolate yet. He hired a chemist who told him that you can't just add milk to chocolate to make shelf-stable milk chocolate. In Europe they used powdered milk but Hershey decided to go with sweetened condensed milk instead -- that might be because liquid ingredients are easier to work with when you are mass producing food. Anyway, the chemist couldn't figure out how to mass produce sweetened condensed milk w/o burning it. So he let a one of his workers have a go. The worker boiled the milk in a vat that was under a partial vacuum. The vacuum allowed the milk to condense w/o burning but there was also some fermentation that produced butyric acid. Butyric acid is present in some cheeses but also vomit. Human taste is a little strange in that we often equate a flavor with our first experience having it. If the first time you tried butyric acid is when you were sick then you might remember that the next time you try it. Anyway, the worker offered to try to remove the butyric acid but Hershey seemed to like the sour note that it gave the chocolate. Since Americans are used to a sour note in our chocolate, if Hershey were to take it out then it would taste like something is missing. If the European chocolate had an ingredient that was an acquired taste then no doubt Americans would be stupid and unsophisticated for not liking it. But since it is in American chocolate, Americans are considered stupid for liking an ingredient in our chocolate that is also found in some cheeses.
Don’t they mean a Marathon bar?
American chocolate is garbage in comparison to most other countries chocolate. Unfortunately all countries pale in comparison to Belgium and Switzerland's chocolate.
Looking forward to Kit Kat. They have so many varieties.
They completely forgot about the celebrations snickers! Easily the worst bar in there but it’s still there!
The vomit after taste is because of a  a process called controlled lipolysis.  This breaks down the fatty acids in the milk and produces butyric acid - the chemical that gives vomit its very distinctive smell and acrid taste.  And since butyric acid is found in parmesan cheese, rancid butter - and vomit. People associate american chocolate with vomit
I pronounce it nougat.
You guys forgot the snickers that come in the Celebration box and the snickers ice cream bar
Satisfied?
do KitKat please
I like the Snickers of the UK since it has way less calories and a smaller size than the USA.
Oi, what about the mini Snickers that come in a tub of celebrations!?
Harry has his own YouTube Channel now - you should all check it out! First video he reacts to some comments of the Food Wars series.
4:55 Legit lost my breath laughung at this🤣
you guys have really run out of restaurants haven't you?
More videos like this pleaseeeeee🥰
6:25: Brick Heck anyone?
Butyric acid is what gives the US it’s vomit taste because unsurprisingly butyric acid is found in vomit
they ran out of restaurant to compare with... so they went with candies, which is SO much more intresting
Make more food wars on snacks WHAT
I prefered the name Marathon
Mr cod fish and chips do that lmao
You guys must try Indian stuff.. Everything's shit in here and we have the bare minimum variety in any given thing!!🙄🥲🤣
Ok I'm heart broken now. Was rooting for the stars and stripes on this one 😕
I had a Kit Kat on my Italian honeymoon in 2019, on account of all the “chocolate in the EU is better than chocolate in America” stuff I’ve heard over the years. It’s 100% true. It’s so much better over there than over here.
Please do and entire series of food wars on candy.
We need lays vs walkers next
Since when was that the snickers logo
Now I know to get chocolates from UK instead of US!
I love this!!! Amazing job!!! Thank you!!!
American chocolate tastes sour because we didn't solve the problem of how to make milk not spoil we figured out how to make spoiled milk into milk chocolate its kinda gross if you look into it
There are still many types of Snickers in US!!!😕
Idk if this also In America but there are snickers ice cream
the UK has white chocolate snickers in b&m
Next chocolate one. Which there different tips of chocolate. I know some chocolate names that be good for next time food wars. Cadbury, Galaxy, Nestle which they do chocolate and sweets. Mars, Katle and M&M. One of those be good for next time food wars.
Honestly this series just make me not want to try anything that comes from the US more and more
The reason for the vomit aftertaste in US chocolate is the use of Butyric acid in the production, which can also be found in vomit!
Next one hersheys
You guys should do US Vs UK Costco food court.
MATURITY IS WHEN U REALISED THESE GUYS DOSENT HAVE SO MUCH "FOOD CHAINS " LEFT FOR VIDEO
USA be like: Ultra size XXXL Mega super bar
The numbers were hard to follow with no comparison offered next to the numbers. These videos should be better than that by now
Nice after 1.69oz was just hilarious 😂😂
What about the Snickers in a Nestle Celebrations 🍾 box 📦
Damn last i had snickers is about 2 years ago because i was so in loved with it, eventually i get bored...  Thanks Food Wars. Its midnight, and now im craving for snickers again
MARATHON!
In this case they should really really also compare with the German market, since they have a mix of US and UK it would seem.
We also have the Snickers crisp in Australia.
Technically in the UK we do get fun size but it's more common for Halloween time  🎃
CrossFiters- heavy breathing
Not food, but you should do the coca-cola company products UK v US
Snickers almond is not exclusive to the USA though, we have it in Mexico too 🤔
so can I eat a huge Snickers bar a day an supplement the rest of my nutrition ( ಠ ▵ ಠ)?
i’ve never been early to one of these, but they’re very enjoyable so thanks for the content!
What countries are UK and US Snickers made in?
Being from US I think I agree with UK guy about their chocolate being better. I always preferred Cadbury over Hershey.
I need that Slice n’ Share bar in the UK right now, but I will not be sharing
The US sizes are crazy no wonder they are fat
It's crazy that Snickers gives UK a better quality product than they do for their own country. Wtf
In the UK, you're missing the snickers within celebrations boxes! They're tiny! But still so good 🤤
I just eat Snickers
Bruh i didnt even know other snicker products existed except for the bars and the mini ones you get in those boxes with chocolates
AHHhhh I'm dying of  *first* ...
Aren't there tiny snickers bars in UK celebrations boxes?
SNICKERS is my favorite chocolate 😋😍
Joe actually pronounced everything correctly first time
I just love the US guy like he is just so damn funny
We do have funsize bars in the UK, just only at Halloween 👍
UK HAS DAIRY MILK....THEY WIN THE CHOCOLATE BATTLE HANDS DOWN ✌️🥰
Nah the ‘ snickers crisp’ are soo good

All american chocolates are awfull. I have an uncle who lives in the US and another one who lived in the UK....Both brought chocolates when they visited us.....US oned wouldn't be eaten, even though they were the same brands (kitkat, snickers, mars etc)
Do instant ramen brands
So that's why I haven't seen king size on the shelf
And what do we have in Germany? Classic and sometimes white Snickers!
Please do a Wendy’s UK vs USA! There’s finally a Wendy’s in the UK
Do us vs uk  milky way chocolate
A all episode an Snickers! You found enough material for that? 😳
In the UK, some stores sell white chocolate Snickers!
It's obviously nougat!
I think doing Hershey chocolate bars should be next!
Chick fil a 🇺🇸 vs 🇬🇧 food wars🥳🥳🥳

How about a comparison video on Lay's/Walker's chips/crisps
Chick fil a USA vs uk war That would be great

You're not you when you're hungry Snickers - Get Some Nuts
In the UK most chocolate bars have been decreasing in size but the price has remained the same. It’s also known as Shrinkflation
Finally Snickers 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your not you when you've not had your snickers. Never knew there was enough brands of Snickers to fill out a regular Food Wars video.
Americans are so extra I can’t-
Who actually shares the sharing sized bar?

We need a walkers v lays !!!
Snickers are my favourite chocolate who else likes them?
Bloody hell. Just when I thought they'd ran out off shops to compare, they drop this. That's it, they'll never run out of content lol
