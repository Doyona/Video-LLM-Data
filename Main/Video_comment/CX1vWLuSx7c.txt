Well spoken on the mic baby girl
2024 Sha'Carri 1st place and Thompson Herah is last place... crazy what a little time can do.
Beautiful ❤
Let's go Champion 2023.  This journey's just begun. Let em know. #Paris2024 💪🏾👸🏾🥇🥉🥇 💪🏿😤👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿🤝🏿🥲
A week to go till 2023 pre/diamond League final. Strange how a small duration of time can change circumstances!!
How changed she is today. A lot more mature and selfconfident.
Am here after budapest
she needs to act less hood rat ratchet angry black woman vibe btw her nipples pierced
Pre boob job.
She sounds high as a kite.
She made that speech while smoking pot
😂🤣😅😆😁🙃, SHE NEEDS TO MOVE FASTER.... What's wrong? IS SHE IN LOVE😳😯🤕😋😞
What's witht he blonde hair?  Not cool!  She's culturally appropriating white girl hair!
Sha'Ratchet
Hehehehe - gotta luv the Jamaicans
💩 Imploding 💩🚽 Sha'neneh 🎶🎶🎶🥂🇺🇸💯
THIS should have been the post race interview.
I wish her much success,  however she needs a good publicist.
All talk….
Then stop talking trash .
Those fake long nails gotta go. I don't  care if your white, black, brown, or pale. They do not look good on women.
I am not a Sha'carri Fan...at all. But I will admit this is the most mature I have ever seen her act.
Y’all keep talking about her age, most athletes are young period esp in track
11.31 at US Championships😂 Period😜💅
A Hum, been a track follower all of my life, and she has so much more to go into maturity.  Hope she figures it out.  God will absolutely humble her.
1:03  "Genuincy"? 👀😩
GO Sha'Carri!  She will shine!
L 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
American always so over exaggerate but loveee tooo Alyson Felix always humble always look forward to the prize love from 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Can she run sub-11 seconds again? She ran 11:37 today
This is the sha'Carri that I'm used to
WE KNOW YOU LOVE WOMAN CAT LICKER, PLUS HOW DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD, BUT NOT THE WORDS IN IT. CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE.
She's a natural actress and I believe she should leave track and pursue acting
She's a wild child
So what media wants athletes to say is: " I'm gonna go train a lil harder I thought I was ready but apparently not" yall bashing her for feeling confident she already proved a lot give her her credit. Soft ass world
Is she really not gone run again
I wanna say , big ups to this girl......big ups for going to college , excelling at her sport , and keeping a positive message , an important one people forget , move on and get better. She's a young lady , she's not going to handle everything the way everyone thank she should. She's going to make mistakes. It's funny how only our athletes are expected to be pure , and when a 21 year old shows that they're 21 , somehow people want to drive an extensive  narrative of negativity about them provoked by the same people that try to make Kyle Rittenhouse look like a hero. Is funny how many of our black brothers and sisters take it and run with it. All of us always need to be humble and we're "good" when we're humble. Sounds like another form of shut up and dribble to me.
Hope she never gets to represent the US on the international level
She lost and she’s acting like this. She’s nuts..she never mentions she should get better or train harder. She spitting on this fake Positive front. She’s a mess. She’s just worried about proving people wrong and that’s the wrong mindset to have. She calls her self grounded her she keeps bringing up haters. She doesn’t even have enough sense or reaped to put her phone away.
Can’t even hold anything with those ugly extra long nails. Have y’all ever saw them touch their phone screen with them?? So dumb
She’s just all around toxic
Sha’Carri Richardson - YOU LOST AND YOU LOST BAD!!  YOU NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE THOUGH AND SIT YOUR ASS DOWN
Sha'carri Richardson is ONE person who speaks for HERSELF.  Just remember all of the OTHER African American women in track and field NEVER attacked nor spoke division between ALL OF US DIASPOREANS !  JUST REMEMBER THAT.
Sha’Carri is gorgeous
Probably too stoned?
Weeds was to mask ROIDS in her case
You mean the hood in you came out?
Can’t stop looking at the piercing lol
Such a myopic sport
Is that an ipple ring?
ew. she is the epitome of the last person you wanna smoke with. she stresses me out.
Why do ppl give so much of who they are to social media they're responding with feelings to ppl they don't even know however they like the likes and ur a hater if I chose to dislike or I leave a factual comment about something you've done!!  If you know what you can do and you're speaking about GOD y the I'll show you losers for commenting on me finishing last FACTS  I care about what ppl think about me CRAZY!!!!
None of you are physiatrist None of you are therapists. Please stop assuming y'all know what she going through... diagnosing somebody YOU HAVE NEVER MET. It's Insane. Miserable People  literally sit around and wait on the downfall of someone
She talks like a MAN
Sacrifice.....? Sacrifice the hair and nails. Sheesh. Wind drag
I love her tho lol
She hurting!
5 months later, I'm still laughing at this overhyped, arrogant, delusional, false pretender to the 100m throne. She is a trip!
She’s insane.
The sportwear company invested a lot of money in the story of rising star Richardson. Expensive TV commercial, public relations pieces, interviews etc. She HAD to beat the Jamaican girls and make USA No. 1. The marijuana was a 'mask' for performance-enhancing drugs. When she came back from her ban and no longer using enhancers, it was clear that she can't run. The End.
sou fã dessa menina,com ela o atletismo fica mais gostoso de assistir.so queria tradução.
She’s genuine
Mad Crush on this woman! She is Gorgeous inside & out, I'd love to smoke a blunt with her!
"she is only 21 years old, she is young"...Shelly Ann won her first Olympic Gold medal at 21.
LONG STORY SHORT. ASS GOT WHOOPED
she is good enough for the US team , suck it up USA
Way too self obsessed
Them nails aren't making her go any faster
U can tell from the hood hood 😆😂🤣😆😆
Drop the unnecessary nipple piercings, rings, jewelry, eyelashes, wig, nails and anything that’ll decrease your drag and weight, and perhaps you’ll be able to back up all of that nonsense you preach without steroids, little one.
Protect and train the right joints.... it's a clean machine process!
Karma
She needs to lose those nails that are slowing her down like airplane wing flaps.
Many prayers to you!!!!
Ofcouse you feel delicious, cuz ‘em Jamaican just eat you out baby….
What are y'all complaining about? She took her L, but she's still proud and focused. Y'all want her to get on here and cry and look defeated and she's still confident.
I love this girl
Hopefully she bounces back and comes back on too soon. I believe in her.
She ratchet from the look to the speech smdh that show the upbringing is not that solid
Lacks humility. Lacks class. Very tough to support despite her age.
Why do black girls want to be white so bad?
Stop trash talk and train, period.
Less is MORE.
Sore loser
Damn homie Last race you was the woman homie Wtf happened to you
Go Sha’Carri
Those nails are hideous and must have weighed her down.
🤢🤢🤢 no class and ratchetness.
…… she’s beautiful. She’s got lots of talent. Then you hear her speak: and all comes to mind is “please just shut up”
Train Harder talk less.
Girl you look ghetto so much fake crap on her
So now, you put God in your conversation, after being disrespectful on national tv, in front of families and children. Stop. Really wish our ladies would stop the clown makeup. Seriously...no shade intended.
She should be never allowed to interview..she sounds horrible...
NEVER denied......merely delayed.  Absolutely AMAZING young lady😊   NOTHIN stops a Champion.
She sounds like Adrian broner
Lost all my respect home girl  I dont care about the weed. Its ur attitude and cockiness and the fact u have it when ur last place and just got kicked out of the Olympics making it an embarrassment for our country... sad
She’s all talk 🥱 let’s go Jamaica 🇯🇲 they the real runners
She needs a BEAST of a PR rep, humility and a few more years of maturity and training. She can still come back strong!!  Without those things, she’s doomed to be her own worst enemy.
First of all her mind is in the wrong place, but people who think highly of their self won't listen. When she missed the Olympics it hurt her speed because the other women reached their top speed. Plus to mention God and being gay, something God is against, she might never win again because she don't represent our Heavenly Father, the flesh and the devil is who she follows. Probably will never win again, little girls might think that it's alright to be gay if God let her be the best for years to come.
She's full of herself and is a racist apparently towards Jamaicans... She got popular for failing a drug test and winning one race... and it went all to her head.
Im a guy but I couldn’t imagine running and competing with make up and those long ass nails. I ran with my gold chain and even that was a lot. I wore it though because it’s very important to me. She look like she really need that make up snd shit tho or else she wouldn’t have it on
Please girl regroup yourself.
Wow., She feels delicious. Keep working Sha´Carri, you are good in what you do...
👊💯....you aLways....y'aLL aLways winners.🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️❤
Idk what it is but i dont like her. 😐
What is "genuincy"...
I love this young lady!  I love her confident and her ability to enjoy giving her best no matter the results! You have to keep working to get batter and you have to enjoy the process!  That is for all of us! Keep up the good work, Sha'Carri!  You are an inspiration!
I love her.
Blah blah blah her only claim to any fame will be getting busted for pot. What a legacy. 🤷🏼‍♂️😂😂
She never seems genuine
In this sport . . . a "half second" can determine whether you are 1st or 5th. It requires your full focus because other runners want it more. I  think if she spends less time creating her look, she could be putting more money in her pocketbook. Create a legacy before you try to cash in on one.
It seems unfortunate that this young talent appears to have psychological issues but I hope its just her youth & inexperience.
"I feel delicious"........yassssssss.   Everything she is talking about is in the comments. Look at you Mofo's. She talking about y'all...😆🤣😁😄
Where is the nearest trash can? 🗑 she needs to sit in there.
I recommend steroids at this point
She’s Growing, she’s operating under a lot of pressure, a few missteps BUT she’ll be back, everyone loses at some point, 🇳🇬🇺🇸
Now out of all the gas lighting done to this girl cuz so many couldn't wait for an excuse not to like her, I find it ironic that no one caught this interview from the same day about 20mins to an hour later.   Like she said, no excuses. She took full responsibility and apologized, congratulated the winners but media focused in the 2mins she lost her cool.  Those of us who really see Sha'Carrie gone ride for her cuz we see what's coming for her. Fake supporters only love you when you up and hide they self when you down.
Love this interview from her. I like her. Climb back up. I know she had a hard deal so I get it and so does she. Now it’s on like the light bulb. Let’s go get it ! But then nipple rings though
She was rocking on the love boat when the vid started
You love women and you could not congratulate them. You will win popularity contest but no gold medal with your attitude.
She cool for standing there and face the media and still have confidence. That being said, what's up with them nails??! She can have long fake nails,and but wtf are those?!?! Made from elephant's tusk?
Enough with Sha she belongs to the garbage. Show some love for Athing Mu. Athing Mu did not only gave 2 gold , she also stop the drought of the 800’s by winning gold.
She's entertaining at least
She just likes to run her mouth.  I'm surprised she let them get questions in
1:03 SHAWTY SAID “GENUINECY”? WHAT AN EMBARRASSMENT
She's nice
And the Jamaicans win, yet again! 🙄😂
False Pride is a mf..
Shes right.. she is her biggest enemy!!! She doesnt think about what shes saying, she just runs off at the mouth... trying too hard 2 sound intelligent & ghetto @ the same time.. only makes her sound ignorant... Shes bothered af...
All she a talk she full of attitude enuh🤣
She came to talk not race that’s her problem
WE ALL KNOW WASSUP........HUMILIATION RITUAL.......MIGHTY FUNNY AFTER SHE WON,,,SHE TEST POSITIVE FOR WEED...THEN COMES DEAD LAST ...REALLY SMH
By her attitude and the way she answers these questions she’ll never be a winner
These comments are grossly judgmental. Half of you probably can’t run to the corner store let alone stand in front of a world as they judge you after loosing a biological parent and get your career judged for taking a drug known for slowing you down, without falling apart. I saw nothing but strength and self pressure to not break. Truly amazing.
“We.” 🤔
WHATS WITH THESE STUPID YOUNG DREAM WANNA BE QUEENS ! omg , someone tell her to stop the yaking
what a turn  off OMG , i so much love the jamaican girls , shes a smack talker that is full of nothing , what international event has she ever won ........NOTHING !  a big ZERO
RATCHET
You can be 15 and be a graceful loser.  And I  see no excuse for her response to Allyson Felix.
Yellow hair and black women and bad personality . What is she going through
I don’t think there is anything wrong with her interview. She didn’t disrespect anybody and she is saving face. But nothing wrong with saving face. It’s like NBA2K press conference answer options. She chose to answer in the less favorable way. Many up and coming athletes get cheeky with the camera. Until they learn the benefit of keeping it political and clean. And she’s a young woman of the younger generation. They talk different anyways. All i see is another young athlete with the spotlight, not handling the pressure well. But she’s holding in and fighting through it. It’s been a while since I saw a young black female athlete be the talk and have the headlines for a while. That’s a testament of how great she has shown to be. She needs to be open to being groomed to handle the pressure. Maybe her coaching team ain’t fit for the transition. But right now she’s on top. And she don’t even realize it. Even after the loss, she’s on top. I want to see her turn into a star.
Rematch.
I like her oblivious confidence...she a youngstas she suppose to feel this way...
This woman is a loser, period!!
It seems like she keeps laughing to keep from crying. I had to come see the interview myself after everyone kept saying she was arrogant etc!
She already a has been and she knows it. Body language tells all.
We're witnessing the very beginning of her downward spiral..Stick around and enjoy the show..
She needs counseling and a media team. She young and clueless.
Not a warrior why do women want to be even more masculine than they were already taught to be a warrior kills and probably dies in a battle
I dislike her arrogance and ignorance
Whoever does her weaves need to stop. Now. Hideous
She’s in so much pain, I hope she gets the help she needs!
she's a runner but not a track star 🎶
I think what she meant to say was "if you ain't first, you're last".
Why that guy congratulate her.?
She look like a drag Queen the joke is on you nobody care about you teeana Daniels is way better than you
1:30 No, it literally is an L, queen! You made it last place on the track race in front of the whole split pangaea. That is a pretty bad L in my book.
0:53 Translation: Joke's on you, I already lost.
Okay so she talk like she loves successful women but all of her post make her seem like she's a hater of those OTHER successful track and field women
SHE IS THE MOST FAMOUS ATHLETE IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. MORE THAN THE JAMACIANS .
Here is the real reason-its her arms. She has little scrawny ass boney arms and she does not use them when she runs. I am amazed she ran under 11 seconds with her running motion. She has to hit the weights-do hammer curls, whatever, to get more upper body strength. Also fire your trainers and coaches.Just compare her running style to Shelly Ann, or any other top sprinter.
This is like watching a Tupac interview
Blame ShaCarri coach for her NOT being ready
You are trying to hard. No body counted you out. It is not what you say it is how you say it. Just lessen the attitude.
She so young. And needs to be humbled. And today was that day
She just has a head full of hair.
Stupid announcer in the background talking about "periood" stfu, that's the rachet shit she needs to get away from
Respectfully, she clearly requires serious mental health counseling. It has absolutely nothing to do with confidence and ability, but everything to do with maturity,humbleness, acceptance in one’s self, and being able to handle what comes with being an real true caliber athlete. Her and her management have a long road ahead. ADVICE: NOONE is believing Her talk, answers, and game that she is currently speaking.
You could base an entire psychiatry conference on that few minutes.
Someone who is a public relations professional in all probability took her aside after what she said and said" this is what you actually need to do starting from this point forward period, because what you did at the Prefontaine does not work not for you, and not for track and field, and you embarrassed a lot of companies interested in giving you an endorsement deal"
Rumor has it she's still suffering from smoke inhalation.
Good attitude for someone that got smoked. Damn. All that talking before the race. Smh.
God protect her.
She forgot to run like she stole it.
Listen to her speech. She is not in the right state of mind.
Gotta love Sha...F$@k the HATERS!!!
I’m not going to lie but that was a great interview.
Aw man I wish sis would just chill, or she will have so many regrets when she get my age (44). Its hard to look back and know you didnt meet your own greatness because of nobody but you!
Nipp rings?
😍😍😍😍😍
Would tap
You really ain't "that girl"
I just can not take her seriously.  She is trying to say the right things but it is coming through as arrogant.  I wish her the best and hope she overcomes her issues.
She seems kinda ignorant. Nice nip piercings though
No weed no speed no Brain......
Love that she still has confidence!! She’ll be back! 🙌🏾🙌🏾😏
What a beauty, absolute G
Pray for her man, demons are real
Yes u have alot of support
She still a baddie, even if she’s lesbian! Y’all need to stop hating on her because she’s black, she has long nails GET USED TO IT!
i think she has a history on Real Housewives of Atlanta . I can see her shifting Kim’s wig .
Why did she say she feels "Delicious"??? 🌫👱🏿‍♀️🌫    💭 🤔
You conquer many - you strong  You conquer yourself- you mighty   Keep on Sista God be with You
🤦🏾‍♂️
Jamaica...
Somebody should have grabbed her.. this is terrible...strong and tall in last place...it was best to say I wasn't training like I should have been DOING.. and I wasn't being focused but I'm about to go back and get it together.. not all that delusional stuff she was rattling...
Did she say genuinely, see that’s why her mouth gets her in trouble, she needs to get her vocabularies up to par,
SHAKARRI, THANKS FOR KEEPING IT GANGSTA, GO USA. YOU DONT NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR NOTHING! YOU UPGRADED THE VIEWER RATING. YOU BRING EXCITEMENT TO THE TRACK. FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE SPORT SO YOU CAN TAKE YOUR MARK!
What had she been smoking ?
Nike straightened her up after all that arrogant talking after the race! It shows…  She needs to come back to earth… she is flying high but she has not won any major competition. Some humility and wins before non-sense bragging!
Please shut up 🤐
Its funny how the Media showed the interview right After her loss when Emotions were running High, but when she was able to calm down and give an interview with Class they don't Promote it. Haters and Naysayers can believe its over if they want, but this 21 year old Phenom will have the Last Laugh! Screenshot It!
Can anyone even begin to imagine what her attitude would have been like had she won that race?
she was calm in this interview. people need to chill and give her another chance
That race was rigged
She trying to act like she ain't bothered and embarrassed but you can tell from her movements she feel dumb af because she was doing all that arrogant ass bragging and them Jamaicans gave her a slice of humbled pie! A BIG lesson has been taught to her that day! BE HUMBLE!
You're  done
🙌🏽🙌🏾🙌🏿💙♀️
She got on nipple rings lol...
Blows her Olympics opportunity,  exposed as a homophobe, finishes last, and now throws shade at Allyson Felix. SMH
I tried to like her, but her personality is sh!t😔🙄🤔 🤡n she's comes off as a total fake. She needs a PR person,,, bad. Total psychopath.
why interview the last....wtf even listen to her?.....lets chase the winner
She's delusional
At 4:00 most of y’all wouldn’t understand that.
Good job.  Keep your head up and stay confident.
Why is she talking about haters ? My hood folks have to get out of that habit thinking the world is against them.. when questioned stick to the question only. They live shoving a mic 🎤 in your face when you lose. Don’t respond to the blogs stay professional stay focused.
The female version of CNN  🤣🤣
She is beautiful
Keep doing you Queen.
Your children would be playing with Sha'Carri Richardson dolls right now if she knew how to act like a professional.
Fake fans switched up
she’s human at the end of the day she doesn’t need the whole world bashing her. y’all wildin
No child left behind?...lol sike 🤪
U are beautifull.  Keep competing.  Maybe maybe not but keep going
The minute she gets home and closes her door she will break down crying
I pray she finds healing and peace through Jesus. She is hurt and confused.  It’s not hard to discern after the two Interviews. I still have hope for her.
Tbh what did she say wrong y’all mad because she believes in herself some of y’all need to her confidence always got y’all heads down when things don’t go y’all way she don’t have to praise the other athletes that was in the race it’s about her as it should be about you
Well atleast we know for sure that Marijuana is not a performance enhancement drug...
Leave that fucking weed alone
She is letting the fame get to her. I don't like her attitude, but I hope she turns it around. Do I think she will..? NO. But hopefully I'm wrong.
She is feeling the pressure. I support her but the the pressure of trying to prove everyone wrong might not be worth it especially with her having such a big platform.
Shut up and smoke some more dope. She's phoney.
Don't just talk, prove it. Sixth fastest is still 6th n no medals...
He's done miracles on me
So we gone ignore the dude, who walked by and congratulated Sharkarra on coming in last? Or did I miss something?
The way she speak/act is depressing to watch 💯
This is how you look when you arent trying to impress anybody.
she was dissing in THE INTERVIEWS  SO WHAT SHE SAYING NOW
😂😂😂😂😂
Y'all criticizing her like you never had failure in your own damn life.  If you are one those critics, go to your room and look yourself in the mirror and replay your life back. You'll see how disgusting you are right now. God bless you young lady and keep fighting because your better days are ahead to come.
The way she talks sounds like she’s selling some pyramid scheme
She too ratchet and masculine
Kobe Bryant shot four airballs his rookie year in one game against Utah. Even though he had plenty of potentials, he failed embarrassingly in his first playoff appearance. He was an emotional wreck. In an interview, Kobe said that he went straight to the gym after the game and practiced until the next day and did it repeatedly. There has never been an athlete with more work ethic, discipline, and attention to detail like him in any sports. At the end of his career, he had more championships than the airballs he shot and wrote books inspiring children to perfect their craft. He was a tutor to many young players. Ms. Richardson was capable of taking second in this race. Something went terribly awry. She did not say what but she promised to fix it. Many people have taken to social media masquerading their stereotypical opinions as psychological facts to describe Ms. Richardson's poor running performance and media blunder. The world only values success. I hope Ms. Richardson, who has made several mistakes earlier in her career, can learn from them and come back to prove her critics wrong, as Kobe did. Hope she reads Kobe's books and listens to his interviews. She has to write her story and not let the media do it for her. I am happy she has faith in God to help her through it.
I love Sha’Carri Richardson! holdin her own—said a mouthful at the end.
https://youtube.com/shorts/E5Ca9JFYGAk?feature=share
Keep going queen
She need to stop smoking. Smh.
The 3rd city girl 😂
What she need is a public relations manager, I get asking athletes questions after losing, but her response was shocking. Especially to finish in dead last. Then she attacks everyone who has something to say. Sweetie, you can't fight every battle. Train and come back harder for the next race your young enough to do so. Stay focused but the more you talk the more people will come at you. It's human nature for some folks.
She needs to learn how to control her mouth and attitude. Her mouth IS guaranteed to get her in trouble. She has no sportsmanship and as an athlete at that level that shouldn’t be new to her. You win some and lose some
Mahammad Ali one of the greatest always talked trash in the beginning and the end......Floyd Mayweather also one of the greatest still talks trash and is WINNING!!!!!! what's wrong with her or any of them being Confident???? She does not have to fit inside of society's box let her be GREAT!!!!!! I'm extremely happy that she has self love and inspires to the be GREAT! She will have many other opportunities ......I myself love it! wish I was the confident when I was her age.....
some will view her as cocky or arrogant, but that’s just how she was raised and taught from the environment she came from, learn to read beyond her words; she’s hurt she couldn’t perform at her best, she’s hurt from the things she had to endure over the summer with the media, but she blame no one but herself, she will be back to win, she’s thankful for everyone’s support and congratulated the winners and gives current/future praises to God.
She's alright, dunno what the hate is about. So she finished last & said a couple things, but that's her way of staying determined. She did also admit that she is her worst enemy, a sign of humility & reflection. She may not be eloquent, but she is young & talented.
This is because the American female has been allowed to paint there fingernails 8 hrs a day. They was once a time when they worked hard for a living, but that is all in the past. She needs to be checked.
With all the shyt and stereotypes we go through as a people we MUST hold her accountable and give her the criticism that she deserves...The whole country and world is watching her I definitely don't want the world to think this is what represents our women, She openly called for gay people to die in a pit,openly mocker her fellow competition on twitter, she smokes weed, fake hair weave,hoochie mamma entire,showed absolutely no class after losing in LAST place,  Can we once raise our standards of professionalism as a people and kick that ghetto hip hop street mentality??
Jesus, I hate when people talk about God. God helps people win, he helps people lose, he saves people from cancer, and he kills people with cancer🤦
Sha'Carri Richardson, the marijuana warrior that came in last.
Last place gets a 5min post race interview but Elaine Thompson who ran a 10.54 the second fastest in history gets no love.. This channel didn't even upload her post race interview. No respect.
This should be a SNL skit.
Tell my lady to keep looking sexy and keeping winning. Even Michael Jordan had bad days.
She got SMOKED !!!!
If she would have left the Beyonce wig in the locker room she would have won the race Just my opinion
Respect 💯
i'd hit bruh no cap. and if she don't want to she better be faster than me.           it's a dark humor joke.
Reminds me of a T.O. personality
Why is this women famous?
She's a wor-year
They fake supporting you these white people wanna see you lose...
She's working for endorsements, smart.
This is the result of drug use.
This is yet another life L.E. ( Learning experience) for her, and I truly hope she grows from it, but being a true humbled athlete  has many working parts and one is if you loose ( FAIRLY) in a competitive sport , you should always congratulate the winner to show good sportsmanship that's like an unwritten rule. She's young and I'm sure she'll bounce back from this if she keeps her mind focused.
She acts like she's still on Marijuana .
She is so cute
That’s a young man. He’s joined the ranks of all the others who are in this business. Right now, it’s a humiliation test.
🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲 👏🏾👏🏾
She was too over hyped up on social media and called attention to herself and failed to bring it On after doing so much Hyping on Social.
People only knew about her a few months now. She is deluded. She is just a local runner in the USA. Everybody knows about her now for the wrong reasons. Felix is a role model. 🤡 difference.......
give this girl some slack, she's a fighter.. she's out here competing in front of the world through all types of struggles (if even within herself).
She has a lot of testosterone hence why she’s always aggressive in everything she does. I’m starting to think 🤔 she might have that Xy thing or what ever it’s called also why she’s proportioned like a young man 👨. She has no  female characteristics besides her voice I guess. Btw I’m not tryna be mean but her energy is not lady like and it needs to be addressed.
Your done. Girl kick rocks.
J
Happy she hasn’t gone woke yet. Smart and talented young role model for others.
She is so full of crap in denial ! Acting like it don't bother her? You can see it in her actions ! Trying to be all tough! I hope she loses again ! Maybe then she will go away ! She is no role model ! Not for anything kids ! The gangsta! Image is trash go home girl and stop flapping your lips it's getting old
Ew
aww smoke another blunt an let it all loose ok...
She's the Kanye West of track & field. She doesn't need to humble herself at all. She's great and she knows she's great. She's put in the work her entire life. We can't tell her anything. She doesn't need to change who she is. It's very inspiring to see someone who's true to who they are with all eyes on them. More people should be like her and be themselves.
No black person should not be tearing down ShaCarri Richardson  There is a thing call divide and rule  It is a big disgrace to see you as a black person fight against another black person do you see the white people doing that, the answer is no, It is good to see Jamaica win in a lot of races but do not put down a black person because she is from America that is totally wrong and disgraceful.
Switch attention to Sydney McLaughlin folks
Sounds like she’s trying to convince herself. I stopped listening less then a minute into the interview 🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
The interview you don't see being blasted everywhere. I wonder why. Keep your head up youngin ❤️
How can one be top 6th fastest on world and be beat by 8 other women, rock on Jamaica 🇯🇲
My opinion that's a man!!! It's gender should be tested!!! It lost, calm down 👎 have several seats please 🥺😣... I did not send for anyone so please don't come for me!!! I can be an adult or I can be petty 🐱 all that mouth poor sportsmanship for fellow black woman  her elders humble child!!! Empower uplift your sisters should be your first thoughts period!!! Win or loose..... Mr......
I cant
if she remove the wig and nails she could do little better .
Whatever she is  🚭 .I hope she is Control.... And talk less..let her track results speaks of itself..
Talk yo shi 🗣
You are a warrior and a soldier athlete and beautiful warrior princess keep working baby girl
About has humble as it gets….    *Sha’Carri giggle* period 🤡🤡
You are a beautiful child of God, yes, God has plans for you, yes, at the end of the day it is an abomination to build a relationship with another woman. I pray the good Lord, the Prince of peace, the King of the world, makes you one day realize that you deserve a man and not just a man but a man that only God can give you and not by what you elect. May one day you have the opportunity to meet a man of God✝️🙏⚔️❤️👑❤️⚔️🙏✝️
Her perspective is amazing. I just fell in love with her
it takes a lot of strength for her to do an interview with such grace and patience! good example. It's takes a lot to make it look easy! 🤍
Ha! Ha ha haha ha ha haa haa ha ha ha ha ha
If she loved women so much, wishing them success... where was she at the end of the race?  I seen the other women showing the winner some love, except for her......... so I call CAP
I remember being the fastest in my class.  Relay day, I had to race against 5 others who was the fastest in their class.  I had a lot on the line... people looking up to me.  I got 4th place... it was super embarrassing 🤦🏽‍♂️
She means well.. Why is no one talking about her nails? Wtf
she's fine her only downfall is representing a sad community that has no clue how to support her.
With all that fake smile on her face. She's trying hard to fake this interview. Because we dam well known she don't care about those Jamaican women that smoke her because she didn't even congratulated them after the race.
You didn't see the Jamaicans talking crazy. They did their talkin on the track. She got cooked And ran her fat mouth!
The nails too heavy..
Can we focus on the winners and not the weavers... 🤡
Sore loser
Keep losing and people won’t be watching for long miss delicious
With those long nails hw does ladies wipe their butt? Honest qns
Damn she got haters for nothing!
she needs to stop having so much pride 🤦🏽‍♀️
Love ya Girl!
She’s so fake
Them nails to long
Better humble yourself
I think Sha Carri just need to mature a little and do less talking......I understand she likes the attention...but nothing is free....you gotta win.....that will bring all the success and attention she wants.  She is just learning and that's OK....it's hard having people attack you and your character etc....so hopefully she will learn to give people less to talk about other than her performance results.
All this to get her back to the olympics just for her to get last💀💀
I ran track  for years. Do you realize how badly you had to train, if you come in last place? She is a PED user.  That performance just proved it
She needs to keep her words LIMITED where her manager at? 😳
She the type to put hands on her man and cause a scene
Shacarri is the future
I’m hopefully about to start my season with the LSU track team this year as an incoming freshman trying to heal from injury currently. If I am ever blessed to go pro, I hope the things that come along with it never change the humble nature & spirit I naturally have.
Mi love her energy after loosing and still have that positive vibes how much ppl you know have that ?
She reminds me of one of those characters from those '70's blaxpoitation movies. She's a throwback to when it was embarrassing to be black.
That's 5:42 seconds I can never get back😞
Well, she succeeded in making me not like her; that was extreme hurt and pride, not supreme confidence; and pride comes before the fall.  You finished last.  LAST!!....Did you do that on purpose??!  I didn't think so.  That interview showed her real character; and It's not one of a champion.  You are no track and field Floyd Mayweather...there is only one of him.....
Pay attention to all those from 🇯🇲 basically clowning her, and attacking her for being blk American, yet when they won the race, the story was still all about Sha'Carri, more than them winning the race. Should be happy that blk women are dominating the sport, yet those blks from outside the states like to make into some blk vs blk hierarchy competition. The idiocy is unbelievable
She seems really off, she should have fired some people retool and came back next year. I think she hurting herself now how she feeling/seeing in this interview is weird
Performer OR ATHLETE???? SHE Need SPEAKING, Ettiquette, Speech & Media TRAINING DESPERATELY
Poster child for the Afroman song
Terrible look .....looks fake an dramatic. All that Cap'n a lose and a str8 goofy look all in all. She need a speech coach. Fake love ....she sounded ignorant tbh
She got issues that probably create distractions but one positive I take from her race and the subsequent interview is she never tried to give excuses for her loss.  We have seen great athletes suspiciously limping once it is clear that the race is lost.
Im sure this was humbling!
She seems to be distracted with all the limelight instead of just focusing on the sport. It's going to be her downfall.
Just saying, she looks ridiculous
Wn keeping it real goes Right
If your running against 20 year old moms you can smoke pot and still win. The best in the world?  Well yes, even 21 year olds lungs will be affected by smoke in the short term.  You have to be the best and then winning by a full second to think you can smoke and still win a real race. It's a shame no one around her knows that !!!  Keep on smoking girl. You have plenty of time to get faster........................
The only way American Athletes can win a race is that they have to CHEAT or DRUGS UP
She’s garbage you’re not that good
Man she has potential I love her but her charachter doesnt match where she has arrived in her life.
Naw first they denied her participation in the Olympics. Unlike anyone else. Pay attention. Lol..IDC what's anyone says. She is not the only Olympian that smokes weed. The training center in Colorado. Lol
What a fake person. Arrogant and fake.  A real amerikaren
Keep smoking baby girl and don’t let these white folk hate the herb that gives our life meaning! Stay strong.
Them piercings tho 😳😳😳
She may be realizing what the issues may be. Her first interview really was bad, but this one makes me feel like she gonna get it together. Wish you the best young lady. Keep centered and know your true support system and do what ya do. God bless.
she got this❤️❤️❤️!
She didn't look like she really run  hard to me..
She knows how to work the media, people still don’t get it she didn’t win by design, they are creating a story in the background. Ask yourselves, why is she getting more publicity than those Jamaicans 😳, those who put her there know what they are doing.
y'all believe this? lmao.
Can someone please put the time stamp where she is cocky? I hear none of that from her, people continuing to jump onto hate train bandwagons
That's right FAV!!!!!! PUSH THROUGH IM SMOKING 1 FOE U POO!!!!!!😂👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽💜💜💜💜💜 THIS GIRL IS AMAZING
Sha'Carri "I represent you guys". You don't represent me. You represent how not to look and how not to act. Love the grace and talent of the rest of the women athletes. Especially the Jamaican women.
Her energy level is on a high frequency than people who will never get it
I think she’s a 1 hit wonder
Sharcarri got to that bag.
she's done, all those steroids didn't help xD no talent
She feeel women typa way.. fake laughs and nervousness Is there...
Always harder on women than men! She's young! Her career and her life is not over!
I love her she has so much to prove to the herself and show the world 🌎 🖕🏽put their words back in their mouth.
Excuse me Ladies and Gentlemen...  Did she win the race?  No competitor crossed the finish line after her. No one was behind her.  She was dead LAST!  Why is she getting so much shine?  America is so upside-down!!!
Why are they talking to the last place finisher Sit yo tacky ass down
Look you're not going to beat the Jamaicans sorry but not sorry. You talk too much!!
Oh dear Lord, she should not be giving interviews at all. Trackfans are NOT your average social media narcissistic audience. Words don't make a loser a winner. Thanks God that at least in running the clock is always right and that's the only thing that matters.
The Last and Furious
What a genuine sweetness! Blessing to you, dear! GOD is good!  She actually came in last! Last time I saw her, she smoked the competition! Wierd!?
She needs intelligent guidance, please help her
Girl you not ready you won nothing back to the drawing board. He he he.
I believe in you Sha Carri!
The girl mom just did give her some slack
Good thing she's fast 🤣😠🤣
Being humble,  is a really difficult job, specially when you Blaine someone else for your failures lol GOD BLESS
I bet she thought she was killing this interview lol
i think those nails caused her to placed ninth… look heavy!! 🤪
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Laugh gets real crazy the more she talks thgh
If only shac approach was right from the beginning she wld be getting alota support from the entire world right now
She missed the 200m race because she was trying to smoke DeGrasse in the parking lot behind the stadium.
Shorty im wit u all the way nut one thing mama u focused on them nails hair and makeup i understand u wanting to be unique and embracing your femininity but when u on tht track none of tht is important...u going threw alot still dealing with the hurt...take ya time time dont worry bout the expectations
Lol you came in last you're done
Wish u all the best but just know that Jamaica hve a ton of ladies ready to replace the ones that r doing it now so humble urself n put in the work cause it’s going to be ruff..
The nigga said " congratulations " 🤣🤣 they hyping her up so much.  She haven't won a real race with real runners thats really fast.  I can't with y’all
Keep going! Don’t give up! Rooting for you!
Sha’Carri baby-there is a time Ann place when one needs to do some deep soul searching. And that begins with allowing God to come in and begin to deal with whatever it is that beneath the surface.  Many times in this interview you spoke about God. The uncomfortable way in which she delivers her messages seems like a cover for what’s really going on. I pray that Sha’Carri will take the time to seek God, because at this point the evidence of her faith seems shaky.   Losing someone can be heart wrenching, that coupled with any other challenges can reck havoc on you. Take everything to God in prayer and allow Him to lead you.  Friends seem to have your best interest at heart, but only God knows what you have need of, just trust Him and place in at the head of your life.
I want to see her win, but life has a way of humbling you. Get right, don't test positive and train. Good luck and much success.
I'm glad I saw this interview. Too much focus is on the negatives of the after race. She spoke very articulate and apologized for her choice of words while speaking passionately on the field. I admire her for that! She's going to be just fine 🏆 !!!
Keep it up top girl we love you!
Please go away. Damn WTF we gotta watch this chicken head all over the place
Jamaica Jamaica Jamaica
Clean up on Isle 6
She shirnks in races with the big guns. I hope she can overcome that..
Yea she lost she is rusty right now she lost but still got all the attention from the world everybody knows her ppl dont know those them Jamaica sprinters congrats to them
We all love her! She's the reason this sport is becoming more popular.
I'm routing for ya girl keep ya head up they stole your dream from you in the Olympics come back and prove to them your the best!!!
she talks tooooo much
Loser
Maybe she was over hyped to begin with. At 21, you shouldn't be finishing last if you're world class, unless you didn't train at all for a month.
Guess nobody saw this interview tho 🤔
They may have their differences, but they are all wonderful ladies. Rivalry can be a wonderful thing; once it is done with professionalism 🙂
Ratchet
She should change up her inner circle, get a new coach and get better PR/Branding…..She has legit skill just need the right folks to manage,guide and keep her focused/humble.
👆 The Rhonda Rousey of Track 🤦🏻‍♂️
0:22...she's not a warrior. If she was she wouldn't have sat out the next race.
Floyd?
The nails held her back
Enough of this chick. She's bigger in her own head than she is in reality. Lets hear from the winners!
She really have a very long way to go a lot more younger girls are coming up and have already been at a higher level than her. Don’t just let because your confidence it clouds your mind. She clearly stated she wasn’t focus on her self during the race but why wouldn’t you when there is a race of your lifetime coming up. Don’t see why she getting all these interviews and she is happy to take em when you should be concentrating on your game. Media really not helping you with that and in time nike will drop her like it’s nothing
Why y’all saying she should be humble she just showin passion I’m happy she being her honest self and not just saying what y’all think she say
'It's not bragging if you can back it up! - Muhammad Ali Unless wins come …
Bahahahaha!!! Loud mouths head south!!! “Fluusssshhhhhhh!!!! Next time, humble yourSelf!!! Ya just looks small sound dumb!!
Are the other runners Cheech and Chong? Because she got SMOKED🤣😂
I’m happy she recognizes that she’s her biggest enemy. I hope she will grow from this and become a better sportsperson. Good luck girl..
Lol.   Lol.   Lol
NUMBER 9 Just shut up please.
🤔 I think she lost on purpose!!!
she forgot to smoke her marijuana??? plus the nails are weighing her down..never knew anyone who trained to be LAST...that is feat of itself
I like her, idc idc.
Already counted you out last year BOOOO!!!
If this young lady had run the race like she ran her mouth on social media, she would probably break the world record.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Role model😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i mean how do you go in a race with 9 inches long nails and this heavy eyelashes , this aint a winners mentality, lol
Lawd, this chile needs some help.
She is so cocky. Whether people wanna admit it or not, this is a bad attitude. She clearly is more focused on naysayers than she is on work ethic.
I have a question has anyone checked for a penis? And those edges girl those edges fix them
She wasn't gonna be the Jamaican women anyway
🇯🇲😂Sha'came...Sha'ran...Sha'lost...and Sha'vex😂🇯🇲
Sha’ Carrie Richardson is Everything Cool. Capital ‘’EC.” Can’t wait to “keep watching”!!!! The nails?! Icy on the cake. On time.
It's too early for her to win. This girl ain't ran 11.00 in almost a year. This was a dive and an apology from Nike. She ran but was told not to compete that's why she's not hurt. She know Her time coming 🏃‍♀️💪💯
She look like a man
I appreciate this young ladies drive. She is young and has to learn a certain level of humility. She will go as far as "THEY" let her. She can make or break her own success with her actions and her mouth.
We can't finish like this and then withdraw from the 200m
If she can remove those nails, she will be 0.5 seconds faster.
She’s gotta refocus on racing  The positive test gave her a lot of attention outside of racing (beats by Dre commercial, etc)  She’ll be back tho
She got them lips 😉 she can get it
Absolutely adore EVERYTHING about this earth. I feel like she will be back like T2. Vibrate ❤️
Who cares
Is GENUINCY a word ?
one word rachet
Shordy got her nipples pierced. Gheez. Real talk, she has to keep up the positive attitude and belief in herself. Lots of haters out here shaming her, She clearly knows herself and believes in herself. Fuck what anybody says. At the end of the day, you gotta be at peace with yourself. Big up Sha'Carri.
U lost...now u trying to make excuses....show what u can, or can’t do, by your running power and not your “mouth” power that clearly shows your immaturity by your behavior during the loser interview....😖😔😔😣😔😖😣😣😔😏
Confidence has nothing to do with running your mouth, and looking down on some of the GREATEST women sprinters of our time. Who told you you're the only one who's been through challenges? Elaine, Shelly-Ann, Talou, and all those great women you run with have been there, done that. But, they dug their heels, ate the humble pie, and worked without media attention.
she got so much time to improve that I hope she develops a good gameplan and get back in the trenches. The GOAT Herah ain't going any where anytime soon. I feel with proper development she can test the other sprinters but she ain't never touching Herah!!!
This is a cringe worthy interview and it’s nothing grounded and humble about her
fuck what yall talkin bout im glad she wont let miserabler mfs keep her down, win loose or draw
Stop with using God as shield on your undisciplined habits
Stay off the weeeeeeeduh..
Last broooooo!!!!! She ghetto af bro
Delusion is reality to the delusional.
She off ecstasy or a perc ...if u know u know
If it wasn't for her no one would care about track rn
Just get back to training and shut up
They gassed her horribly
Maybe she should train with the same energy she puts into her nails, lashes and hair....
she needs to delete twitter immediately she let trolls get into her head.
Sis looks like a transgender. Fake hair, nails and personality. This person is a loser. I’m not surprised one bit she came in last. Weed in her case might be a performance enhancing drug
More like a boaster than a warrior...humble thyself before the Lord.
I just love this girl right here I don't care what nobody say she's a winner in my eyes the fact that she's there and she didn't give up so what she took a l it happens to the best of us but don't count her out she will be back bigger stronger and faster right now is just a minor setback do your thing girl do your thing I am your number one fan
She was in college she on the big league now where all them dick riders at now
LOSER!
She knows that she herself is overrated like a 1 hit wonder
Still support her. She has a few things to work on however. 👌🏿🖤🇺🇸
Idiot for smoking weed....now a bigger idiot after that race......
i love you
We know what's up. These last months have proven how mental injuries can affect even the best of the best. Sha is only going upwards from here. Love you baby.
This is a guy?
That speech was so faxx she a good motivator and keep moving forward 💯
Gal need fi humble har self... and show respect to the elders that put u inna u damn place where u belong... last. Same way Carl Lewis gwan.
I wanted to compete in the Olympics and win a gold medal but I got high. 🎵🎶🎵
Any else notice that people who smoke dope often look colorized, somewhat wild and make excuses? Don't do drugs!
Yeess sista!! The black community supports you... Fuck the others
This girl is in emotional agony. That hood persona never looks good in front of the camera. She has that fake "please don't steal my purse" smile black guys get from nervous white women🤣🤣🤣
She has nipple piercings. Thats dope. Was trynna see what her chest tattoo was.
She got tears in her eyes who is she FOOLING with thus fake interview. So if USA played Jamaica in Basketball of course USA wins. USA VS JAMAICA in sprinting Jamaica wins 93% of the time so stop the HATE PPL. FACTS. BIG UP JAMAICA.
Is she a natural blonde? Does the carpet match the drapes or is there no carpet? Ask the important questions
Maybe she’ll do better next time but she should have known she could have never beat the Jamaicans. In most meets, the men or women’s team are the Kings/Queens of the track!! Very hard to beat!
Elaine RA 🔥 heru
Blah blah excuses
She didn’t handle this loss well but…she took her loss a HELLUVA lot better than Rhonda Rousey after the Holly Holmes KO
This was like the Jameis Winston interview after they won the national championship at Florida State. 'They watching us all over the world right now! They watching us in Afghanistan!!'.
Wow!!!!Very hard to watch...
Puff puff pass
They told her Lose the Race
Those long nails are ugly as hell. I dunno why girls even have tho's scissor fingers
Well when you think positive in life you can only go higher. But if you have a poor outlook on life and low expectations you go down and stay there!
Please stop talking love
Looks ridiculous and even sounds  worst.
Great character!
Her speed proves she is genetically superior to everyone commenting on the video.
One of the few athletes in the entire universe and history of sports, that realizes she is a performer and sports is just entertainment. Nobody cares about athletes grind, and struggle, they only care about how well they perform because that's what they pay to watch, performance. Unfortunately.
I don't think her apology for her attitude is sincere  She has a lot of potential and needs a mentor before she messes up her career by herself
Seem like a lot of y’all just LOVE to kick somebody when they are down, meanwhile what is it that YOU do besides criticize those who are doing more than you ever did in life? A lot of y’all are just like the kind of people you hate deep down and its a sad reality. you say she needs to do better, start with yourselves first ✌🏾🙄
People trying to excuse her hubris. It’s called humility, and that’s a value this Tik Tok generation completely overlooks. Your actions and accomplishments will speak louder than your words especially as a person.
Man. Carris sexy i aint gon lie. Shes hot
She gonna cry in the car 🤣🤣🤣
I love her she works hard and isn't a sore loser she radiates positive energy
Just rachet and classless
Dead last looòoooooooooooooool
I feel like she is currently high
It’s disgusting all these people want her to be coached so she can sound plastic and fake to please them. Or worse the ones who wanna talk about her crying. I like that this is real and passion. She sounded the deepest and calmest when talking about running and yes had nervous energy when she talked about losing. Y’all want her “humbled” or talk about her crying when she got home but what you really me is you want her sad and down. But she doesn’t owe you that view of her. That’s for her to feel on her own if that’s even how she processes. For all you know that girl trained all night and put her pain into a workout. You want to see her weak like you.
That reporter is rude for that
Trash!!!
Really can see her nipple piercing through the shirt… smh
She should just chill 😂
She is so hot
Can she w we get primed to beat her in a race next time no! Shea done bc there were 8 other girls that are faster than her..last place???
PERFORM!! Then there will be no need to talk.
She was 1st in reverse order!
Move yuh bloodclaat 🖕🏾🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Lol nails slowing her down
Get rid of those disgusting nails
I'm hoping she comes back better than ever. None of us older people are same as we were at 21. Heaven knows I've improved. Sha'Carri will do the same. I'm expecting great things from her in the future. Some of her greatest moments might come away from the track 💚
OVERRATED CLOWN 🤡
I'm so tired of seeing shit like this 😂. Just keep it short and sweet and get back to it. We will see how strong u are by u just proving it. Stop giving speeches damn lol.
Sure???? That attitude you had on your first interview lost you a lot of support.
She lost one race. Shut up.
Maybe instead of smoking a blunt you should work on that cardio a little better. Got nothing wrong with smoking a blunt but when you're in the profession that you're in it's probably not a good idea considering you need all the lung capacity you can get. That'd be like me as a bodybuilder going to eat fast food everyday kind of pointless and goes against what you're trying to do. Get them gains!!  Also shows you probably shouldn't have been in the Olympics if you hit last place. Just saying
Lol you done
It is bad to make fun of people and also irony, I say it for shelly ann who is very ironic, there is always an effect that sooner or later arrives 🤞
She's young still learning in the public eye l hope she continues to grow through  her adversity and come back stronger she definitely  keeping God in her responses not so much her alot of athletes should do that I wish her well
excuse my language she is not smart
Plz don’t represent for me last person said that fell like the Statue of Liberty Nate Roberson and you came in dead 💀 LAST as if they picked you out the stands like who wanna race
Maybe she should've trained over the last month.  That might've helped.
I would love to see those piercings👀
She look like the type to pop off at the McDonald’s employee and walk behind the register and shit. Time to be a new type performer baby girl 😏
This girl is delusional 🙄 just leave Jamaicans out of your mouth and don't even try to complete because Jamaicans are a different type of people, they have no comparison.
Staying Positive... PRICELESS!!! *Brush them hater's off 🏆💯❤️
She talked all that bullcrap b4 the race & got her booty smoked...lol😅
You need weed to beat the Jamaican trio!
Is she seeking attention (nervous laugh, blond wig, face glitter/make up, flashy acrylic nails) or is she really wanting to be a champion like the other young ladies who are focused not distracted by anything.
Bring feet to foot race not tongue!!
Spammin big L's ..Smokin that LSU  pack right now
Cause she was high
Sha’Carri Richardson is being used as a proxy for all Black Americans solely for the purpose of disgruntle Caribbean tethers and other Black foreigners to vent their hatred toward Foundational Black Americans.  I witnessed this hatred going back as far as the 1980’s growing up in Brooklyn NY and unfortunately a lot of these individuals immigrate to America with a very toxic energy and they will do anything to please and ingratiate themselves to white people.
Long as she did her best all that matters
without weed her performance goes
If she cried I wouldn’t blame her she’s trying her best to be a good winner
She looks like a wreck 🤦🏿…. But hey do you boo 🤷🏾‍♂️🤮
She have big mouth no even on top 4 big sheme for here to ike like star u not u have long way to go im sorry u not great
Did she say “Genuinecy?” 😂  🤣 😆 She even made up her own word. I feel bad for her. She didn’t have it yesterday, but that happens to the best of em. Certainly was a lesson in humility. Olympics suspension and the lack of reps definitely played a part in it. She also had a nervous race being placed in the center lanes next to the 2nd fastest woman in history. She hadn’t earned that lane spot yet, and it showed. She has immense potential, but she simply isn’t there yet.
Better than I ever did at a 100m good for her
“The confidence comes from being grounded.” No not really young lady.
Her voice is so cute!
You tried it. How dare you judge someone’s expression of their situation. She will be judged if she does judged  if she doesn’t Everyone has impossible expectations for this very young athlete who clearly has a lot of growth to learn but she is literally doing the best that she can with what’s been laid before her. The Internet can be a very mean place where people have very quick opinions without knowing the entirety of a certain individuals experience  fuck you all
I don't care who wants to come at me, SHE SOUNDS STUPID be humble take the L and learn from it.
She will be just fine!
She would've came in last place at the Special Olympics ..
She was the reason many started 👀 its not hate it called disappointment. A true roll model never gives up. social media is a devils game everyone wants to be seen. Weed is legal in almost every state but its not for everyone. Somethings you have to let go in order to succeed.
Seems unstable.
How do you go to a world competition and compete looking like you're doing a tik tok video.🤣🤣
She knew this race was coming... she should've been at least ready enough not to come in last place....
Trying to fix what she said before.... 🙄🙄
She verified what her looks show, she is determined to be a preformer.   Not an athlete.
They pierced 😍
You was properly whupped, full stop
So sad for three last place she looks in sounds stupid
Her career is over
She didnt train I think like did before.  So hopefully this motivate her to train harder not skip days and get back into it 100%.  I can tell this wasn't a perfect training cycle
she looked so nervous and defeated
She is young and should be expected to make mistakes. Her team needs to get it together and give her proper counsel on how to humbly handle defeat… with true humility and not arrogance. Oh, and by the way, let us not be confused, these games were invented by the Greeks to take the God of Heaven out of the minds of true believers. They believed in many gods while the people of God have One God. How weak a people they must have been to need thousands of gods to do what the One True God could do… always win. So let us not say that sports (known in the Bible as emulations, Gal. 5:20, a work of the flesh) have anything to do with God… They do not!
Stay focused Sha your an inspiration to so many young people about the up’s and down’s in life , and I hope you get the emotional support you need and deserve to propel you forward
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😄😄😄😄😄😄
Talk less Work more.. American Black Women🤦🏻🤦🏻
Go gjrl!! We love and support you sis!! #Shacarrie
Focus on the fact that none of her fellow 🇺🇸 teammates/colleagues have posted or shown her public support whatsoever.   Focus on the fact that during the Olympics she never once posted in support of her fellow athletes.   Focus on the fact that she talked her talk yet failed to execute the talk. Focus on the fact that she is disrespectful. This is her 1st international race yet she had one bag of mouth at the pre race interview, disrespectful to the women who have payed their dues and paved the way.   There are other great athletes of Team 🇺🇸 who deserves the support. Athing Mu is such an athlete.   Sha’ Carri needs to regroup, refocus and align herself with those who can positively impact her. We need to stop making excuses, for her. She is going down a dangerous path. This interview is a cry for help. She is ashamed and very embarrassed. The cocky persona is a front to hide her pain and deep issues. Help her instead of encouraging her dismal behavior.
Can't win 'em all. No biggie.
bro one bad race coming from someone who is more successful at 20 years old than most of her haters will be at 80, isn't that bad. I get she needs to be more humbled, and actually not do things like smoke before the Olympics no matter the occasion. People act like she snapped out of prime in just 4 damn months. Doesn't work like that for someone so young. We've seen her run fast, and we'll see her run faster...and I bet then the bandwagon starts rolling again...smh
She needs to stop doing interviews, because she is horrible at it. She needs a positive support system in her life too. Focus on training and not being some TRACK Michael Jordan.
Get the "F" out of here with all that BS. You lost!!!!! You got dusted. Last "F Ing"place " Period". Check yourself, be humbled, learn, train, and don't get dusted LOL!!!!!. This needed to happen. Your too damn cocky and a public joke. Shut your mouth, get counseling, and come back correct " Period"!!!!!!!!!
Pride precedes the fall. She’s a terrible speaker and needs some media training AND an image consultant. Dropping out of the 200m wasn’t a good look. She’s still young, plenty of time to bounce back. Hope she can humble herself and not get caught up in the hype again.
so cringe
She needed that humble pie and I support her. she can bounce back and she is young and learning life.  But she needed that.  And them Jamaicans, wow ladies.
She needs to stop doing interviews. Your nervous laughter tells all about your lack of confidence and humility. Some folks here are saying she’s young…she’s simply not humble. The Jamaican Team has 16 & 17 year olds who are better than her and way more humble. As long as there are Jamaican female sprinters, you’ll never be great. You need to acknowledge and respect the sport!!! You don’t!!!
She talked trash and sold wolf tickets. Young folk don't understand that grown folk will buy those tickets. They came out and whupped her ass. FACT
Get out of her face with them stupid ass questions trying to and intimidate her she's moved for and y'all too...cut it out💅
She has a charming personality. You can't help but like her. I love that she met the press even in bad times and was respectful and open to them. I believe she has a bright future 🌞 She kinda reminds me of Snoop Dogg in the fact that she lays it out there... Telling it real whether you like or not.
Sunrise you can sucking on helium
"Ya see now that I have a ton of weed contracts and I'm gonna be in rap videos I could care less about running." Said any black person ever
Flat as a board
She looks a hot mess all them dam nails blonde hair crazy makeup but she can run
I hear a reversed self reassurances..I hear nervousness. .. that American selfselling..she needs to keep quiet and do the work..
Terrible nails
Talk is cheap. Put all o’ that on a race 😑  Now go home and cry lil baby, but don’t go killing urself now 😑
We are not condemning her or counting her out for loosing  she is human!! But what we aren't going to do is sit back and pretend that this young beautiful talented girl didn't come to Jamaica who gave her an opportunity to race amongst them , loose, show no sportsmanship ,and do a distasteful interview at the end!!!!  She only apologized for her language not for the overall disrespect. Her bitterness showed even after she tried to clean it up in the second interview  ..... we're not rocking with that. Get you some PR  and come back humble and mature in your craft. We're rooting for her
Who was the support system that told her to Stimulate your mind Craig , fuck track and 30 million dollars 💵 and a gold metal.
Gracious Queen, Never Give Up
I'm pulling for this young lady. Failure is the biggest teacher.
I know she's young but that "congratulations to the winners" is pure arrogance! How about addressing the athletes by name or by nations??? You have to respect the position you want to be in... period!! Learn that and see how well you will perform.
I am sorry I'm not trying to be rude but you should spend a little more time reading and educating yourself before she sounds pretty dumb
She needs counseling. She is in pain. Her post interview was horrible. A lot of shit talking and she got destroyed. Her attitude is showing pain. Hope she gets help.
She gon cry in the car
Don't smoke pot kids
She’s too busy trying to look like a white person
Car crash upon car crash.  She’s done before she begins if an adult doesn’t step up and assist this young person
Last ?? Girl bye
“When you focus on your past, that’s your ego. When you focus on your future, that’s your pride. When you focus on the present, that’s humility.”   -Giannis Antetokounmpo  Sha’weed could learn a lesson or two from that
Us track and field team incharge please send her to therapy sessions. She need help 😭
To all the people making excuses for her, you just heard it from her own mouth “nothing was wrong with me nothing went wrong “, she just wasn’t good enough to beat those other athletes, and it’s sad to say she’s still struggling to be professional with her interviews, A Felix need to give her some lessons Nike won’t tolerate this attitude for much longer
If she’s serious she will: dump the hair, dump the piercings, shiny eye things, delete the social media and focus on grinding. She has talent but she thinks her talent is gonna carry her. These Jamaicans GRIND because they know it’s the best way for them to make something of themselves. This girl thinks she’s a legend already
It's so stupid for NBC to run to her to give the first interview but u need to cut them dam nails if u are gonna be a loser also ur getting it wrong ur losing support
She. Cancel
I hope she wins some races.  Lots of pressure and hate on her.
The fake hair, the fake eye lashes, the fake nails, the ugly tattoos, the incredibly arrogant attitude. She's young so I get it but..... she needs a fully grown adult in her life.
Hope she is in touch with Kipchoge so they discuss a range of issues. Kipchoge came 6th or so in London soon after breaking the 2 hour barrier. In Tokyo he got back his 🥇. All the best Sha.
She’s way to scripted… she can’t recall how she’s supposed to answer… she’s gonna cry in the car
It wasn’t a L for us, it was a L for you. She got smoked 😂
That zaza ducking her running up
At least she did congratulate them towards the end.
Proves that weed is not a performance enhancing drug...might be an performance degrading drug...
Typical - Typical doing the same Typical - Typical💤💤💤…
Man she need to fired her trainer and get away from all people who is dragging her failure .i can 👂 the pain in her voice! She need God frfr...she got menatl issues she need to fix...and whatever she doing she need to quit. Because her stands on the track was horrible het heart n mind wasn't. Even at this event
She needs to sit down and humble herself wtf is she talking like that for after big loss gtfoh
she should have been more humble
I will always respect her abilities. Like she said today was just what it was today. Her confidence and accountability was admirable. Stop hating on her she still has more growing to do and when she does all that downed her............ Show some respect then.
Why are interviews with American athletes so fucking cringe man just have a bit of humility and go again
Bruh people in these comments are kinda rude
This poor girl nothing but cringe.
When you have no sportsmanship:
What a fool, dressed like she going to a club…
Smoked. Again.
She got burnt and people are mad about it lol a race is race she got burned period stop being gay and smoking weed. Come out of the lifestyle all together
It’s almost like she’s rehearsing affirmations. She tries to show that she’s confident but may not feel confident. In other words, she needs to do less talking and do more working.
She 💩 the 🛌
Y'all dont truly don't understand her....y'all not not seeing the energy she has for the sport yeah she's embarrassed, but she's like it's all cool she's soaking it all in...y'all saying this and that is fueling her..I've been in her shoes and got laughed at...the worst thing u can do is laugh at somebody that's mad passionate about something....watch her turn everything around and when she do keep the same energy.. she's Guy sensi in track in field
Kinda sounds like she bout to cry
It's crazy how you'll was rooting for her and now you'll turn on her #coldworld
nothing to see here just a girl running a race without marijuana consumption and getting her ass kicked!!
Nike told her to apologise and chill. Way I see it she got 2 strikes left.
She still smoking eeeh ?
She is soooo pretty . Look at her. My goodness. #Girls don’t hate in others
Her smile even tho she lost. She is so strong. I love how confidently she is. She is expiring
I love that all the comments below is showing compassion for her! Knowing she just lost her mom!! I'm being Sarcastic!! Empathy people empathy
I’m surprised she got dust hard tho.. last place.. dang dang it! 🤦🏾‍♂️
Good for her.  I definitely believe that by the time we were her next year, her media training will be reflective in her I interviews. She was nervous and scared here. And her responses were too wordy.  She will be back and better!  Rooting for you Lil Sis!
longest nails and hair on the track. she clownin
People get offended when they see a confident black woman. Yeah, she is the 6th fastest woman on earth right now.... she lost her last race. Big deal. It doesnt mean she  wasnt trying.. or that she was too cocky.. ity means she lost one race to the best women in the world. The people hating on her aint in the top 6 million in the world let alone the top 6.
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
(▪️🟤▪️)(▪️🟤▪️)
Fake laugh, fake words, fake hair,, fake nails, everything looks and sound fake. Too much talk.
SECRET TO JAMAICAN SPEED BELOW https://youtu.be/SNlg8234Yr0
Her nails are too heavy…..
Love youuuuuuuuu keep it strongggggg blessings
Smoke some weed u will feel better
Stop smoking them wines drinking them tweeds. 😤
She sucks! It wasn’t worth listening to her and wasted my time. Just annoying
As a Jamaican, I feel sorry for her.  No woman will win a medal in the 100 meters for a while.  We are just too fast.  God has truly blessed us with the gift of speed.
Yes- big picture! Best wishes, it's just 1 race, nothing more. Don't let it get to you. 🙏
What's the deal with the trashy ghetto nails? She's so much better than that
The Cardi B of Track and Field should be quiet and go train and train again and again!   Loose lips sinks ships!
This young lady needs to be protected, the media will set a trap for her, she is going to speak her way into more drama...
🛑the hate.🛐RE$PECT.when one must run record time to win. God SPEED🔱
On weed first place, no weed last place. Makes u think huh.
You gonna be great just shake them haters off.You are THAT GIRL TO ME TOO.
She has a dream 🛌🛌😴😴😴😴
Everybody talking about “be humble” lol stfu, being “humble” aint got nothing to do with your performance.. you just hate to see confident people because you lack confidence in yourself. People want Floyd Mayweather to “be humble” but that’s really code for “I want to see you lose so you can doubt yourself like I do everyday”
Head up like it’s supposed to be, in victory and defeat.. she Harlem shaking through the pressure 💯💪🏾
She is pretty tho
I luv her. Her spirit, her passion for competing, the strength she shows  every time she expresses her self; she gives you her entire heart. That attitude,  the will to overcome adversity, all those great things will not only carry her in the field of competition but the overall aspect of life in general, she'll keep winning, outside the sport... The part where she says "IAM A WARRIOR, I felt that. Respect to you lil sista. God be with you, always. From LSU track star to the fastest woman ever. Olympic gold still there for the taking( Paris 2024 games) , just keep going after it!!! She said she On God time, not y'all time. Better recognize!!! Baton Rouge behind ya babe!!!  Louisiana & Texas love you !!!
Keep working hard ..you have my respect
Soooo, Nobody cares about the Bar that’s blatantly visible in her nipple… Great representation
Yall talkin shit but alot of yall couldnt even sit there and answer those questions the way she did even after a horrible lost..she young let her be great
Is that really a female?
what ever it is. she still looks stunning
Sha 'Carri! was this planned?👀 I think it was and if it was, it's working because I love you all over again!
“if you choose to count me out jokes on you” 🥴 uhhmm sorry girl but the jokes still on you 😂
She needs stronger people around her to guide her in the right direction. Poor young thing.  Time for someone to tell her. Cut those nails braid that hair. Will shave milliseconds off her time. She was never gonna beat those Girls. Her fastest time is a 10.7.  If she works on her technique. She will possibly catch them.
Her nervous laugh and fake confidence is making me feel sorry for her.
I see why she needs some weed she need to lighten up
Embarrassment to the rce, both color and event. #nomorehoodboogers
Salty
Fake laughs = Big L
She didn’t hit her 🖊
don't give up sha'carri!
Hopefully she can get a mentor like Allyson Felix, who could help her channel her energies.
The most overrated runner ever 😂 she is really slow.
“We fall down, but we get up!”
Trainwreck
This interview is just crazy; is she going to Lausanne on August 26 or Paris on August 28?
I hate to say, but she's never going to win against these two Jamaican women. When Gatlin competed against Bolt, Bolt knew he had to bring is "A" because Gatlin was just that close to defeating him. This young lady came in last by like 10 yards. It hard for your mind to justify making up for that deficit. Every time she competes with these women, everything she saying here is going to replay in her mind along with the thought, as she is getting stronger, so are they. I truly don't think she believes what she's saying to these reporter. You can hear it in her voice.

This Girl has no clue. Hair down to her waist. Full jewelry, Fake Eyelashes w/ Glitter & 6 INCH NAILS! If she spent half as much time concentrating on the race-instead of her Glamour Shot....she might do better. She's everything that is wrong with the Black Community
God loves you so much that He sent His Holy Son Jesus from heaven to earth, to be born of a virgin, to grow up and die on a cross for our sins, and to be put into a tomb 3 days and rise from the dead the third day, and He (Jesus) went back up to heaven. We must receive Sinless Jesus sincerely to be God's child(John 1:12).After we get saved by grace through faith in Christ, if we truly love the Lord Jesus Christ, then we will obey Jesus(John 14:15).  Mark 1:15 "And saying, the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: Repent ye, and believe the gospel." Jesus said in John 14:15 "If you love Me, keep My commandments. "There's a real hell. It says in Revelation 21:8 "But for the cowardly, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone..." Please sincerely receive Holy Jesus and put your true faith and trust in Him today and *please repent.*
I hope she takes her nails off for the relay!
that cheap looking Dollar store wig is what slowed her down in the race, besides the Pot that she smoked right before the race
4:55 “I feel delicious”. Is that like having the munchies? 🤓😋
Anybody who believes anything other than she's running her mouth so much trying to convince herself more than anybody else of what she's saying got some advancing to do upstairs.
2:40 “time to get back in the lab…”.  😣🙄😵‍💫🤓😂
Nice piercings 😂
there no way in hell this isnt a dude (altho the voice is really convincing, not gonna lie )
Crazy how there’s people in the comments who have never been an athlete in their life and have never went through something life altering with the pressure of being an athlete saying how horrible this girl is and she should be acting.
She brings ratchetness to the sport lol she cool tho 💀
God has nothing to do with winning and losing in sports. Be honestly humble and enjoy your youth and sponsors in the sport while having a plan b working for the future. ✊🏾✌🏾
preiodt queen
I wish Sha’Carri Richardson & all the other athletes the best & much success in life, but as Craig dad said on the movie Friday " You win some You lose some but you live to fight another day" its that simple, no excuses.
She is very young, and has the mindset of a warrior. Fight girl, embrace our failures, because through failure comes growth. You will shine. Proud of you.
Last place needs warriors too 😎
This folks, is what a post warning from sponsors speech sounds like.😅
She should have took the 5th.
She lacked sportsmanship.  Congrats to the Jamaican ladies.
She ain't no warrior
Haha you should have seen her interview directly after the race. She says stuff completely different and comes off as a fake bad bitch.
Strong and powerful speech.. a vivacious young woman. Let's spread the love, she now understands the true meaning of humility💪
"Its not the end of the world." She gets a "A" for resilience, Lesson-stay positive..Love her.
ShaCarri personal best time is 10.72, third place time in the Race she lost is 10.76. 😒She could have had a medal 🏅 if she prepared herself. Clearly she has the talent to compete in the Olympics but maturity and hard work  is what set the winners apart. If she been out for a month, she should be training her a$$ off. Instead of partying on IG and smoking weed, she should have been laser focused. No excuses. But congratulations on being talented enough to compete. Number 9 means she’s the top 10 fastest woman in the world.
When you get famous for smoking weed and getting kicked from the Olympics
Babbling airhead
It's not everyday you see dudes with nipple rings
Why they run to interview the last place runner instead of celebrate the winner?
SMOKED!
She wanted to finish last
No offense but is she Trans?
Has she been tested for DSD ?
If my mom was still watching this, she would tell me this is proof that weed messes you up
Hopefully she dont self medicate again tomorrows news shes stunning and brave what a brave loser she showed the young woman out there that just because you finish 9th doesn't mean your last. She definitely needs someone to put their arm around her and say it's ok if you dont always win but if you talk this much shit and get last your going to look like a dumbass as you do now
Why she sound like Wilder after fury damn near killed him
She wanted no parts of that 200.
Why do women insist on these GHETTO awefull plastic nails don’t we have enuf microplastics leaking through our gut ? PLUS they cause fungus ?
Chat too much! We all love you but Jerez, learn  some humility.
Embarrassing! I hope they get people who actually appreciate the opportunity given to them and dont waste a spot next time.
I can tell she was hurt on the inside. I don't think she was prepared for this race. But there's always a next time.
She showed a great deal of grace and maturity to give that interview after a rough race. So many athletes now dodge the media when they lose.
Its ok to lose your effort was good enough for me just bounce back
If she had a PR team they would be screaming STFU!!!!!!!
This is what happens when you sell your soul to the devil. You have to be put to shame first in order to be put to honor. It ain’t worth it!
Sounds like a child, behaves like one too. So much talent gotten to her immature head.
This girl is a star
Sha'Carri, use this opportunity to get your teaching degree, keep competing but prepare to become a coach (or become a principal) so you can teach young girls to be prepared to withstand the ugliness that has been directed towards you. Proud of you my beautiful young daughter and your peeps got your back!!
She hasn't humbled herself yet, clearly she hasn't been working on her craft nor her time. She needed this to happen in order for her to realize there is another level she must reach. Maybe she thought she could just come back & be brilliant but not without training.
She needs serious pr coaching
She thought she was the best.  She’s not.
🤡 freak....you look like a warrior with them beastly nails...🥱...
There's a difference between being Prideful/Conceited and Proud/Confident. Pride always comes before the fall.
https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rk
🇯🇲
Praying for u queen continue to work towards greatness
"IF you want to count me out jokes on you....heee heee heeee" LMFAO
Sha'Carry too much Hype, Sha'Carry too much Talk, Nah'Carry enough Speed, and Nah'Carry no Humbleness. But Sha'Carry Smoke and got Smoked.
It doesn’t matter what you say you lose you lose get over it and move on
The Jamaican girls 🇯🇲 totally dominated sha-carri Richardson 🇺🇸 I suggest LESS TALK, LESS SOC MEDIA & MORE TRAINING GOING FORWARD!
This woman is less humble that when Lavar Ball was trying to promote Lonzo Ball.
🇯🇲🇯🇲🍾🎉🍾🎉🍾🍾Jamaica put Richardson pon lockdown it’s gonna be a long road Jamaican Clayton twins coming..keep moving
If it was a beauty contest she would have won hands down but unfortunately it was a speed race
Beautiful spirit….
Id love to get a slice of her chocolate pie
Bottom line is. She needs to grow the fucc up & learn how to be a real professional for the corporation she’s endorsed by, some of her responses was low key cringey to me it was like listening to a immature girl in Middle/ High school.. like very entitled & she hasn’t won anything it’s irritating to say the least, she better get herself together, a lot of people ain’t gonna have sympathy for what u went through as everybody sees ur a famous athlete with tons of opportunity that a lot of people wish they would have or be in, so why should they give a fucc & feel sorry for you?? At the end of the day she still a woman n women r emotional. But I ain’t sugarcoating for her she’s old enough to know better.
Humble yourself
BROTHAS....this is a PRIME EXAMPLE of what you "DONT" want living under the ROOF WITH YOU.
The nervous laughter you hear is what comes out after your SOUL GETS TOOK when you come in LAST after the HYPE MACHINE told everybody you were gonna WIN 🤣
The last place LOSER  in the 100m THAT CAME IN LAST PLACE has 227K views. ...but the winner of the 200m has 2.2K views. MAKE THAT MAKE SENSE. Now let's see how long it is before YOUTUBE DELETES THIS 🤣
she could of win, but her eye lashes pushed her back, also that long ass weve got caught on the windy pole on the starting line,,,, she should of won.... damitttttttt ( word of wisdome carrie... Humble your self first and stop behaving as a sore loser. just humble your self.. before you lost your sponsorship and career)
DUDE CHIN.
Who is antagonizing this woman????
Thanks for the insight   MOVING FORWARD…….DON’T DWELL
A disgrace to THE CAUSE
Prime example of growing up in the HOUSEHOLD WITHOUT AN AA FATHER.
Just so you know there’s a difference between “performers” and  athletes… I’m sorry but she doesn’t have the stuff. There’s a reason you didn’t go to the olympics . And “gods pace” 🐩 you don’t know shit about pace.
BLONDE WEAVE WEARER....WEAR YOUR OWN HAIR.
Ratchet af
She’s beautiful 😍
Fake nails, fake hair, fake lashes, fake smiles, fake words
How does she even have any sponsors left.
A DISGRACE to THE CAUSE.
Blonde  DRUG ADDICT WEAVE WEARING FREAK....seeks to be a ROLE-MODEL for a generation of young AA females....LMAO
🙄
"THIS".... IS WHAT IS BEING HELD UP AS A ROLE MODEL FOR YOUNG FEMALE ATHLETES WITH MY COMPLEXION. ..... MAKE THAT MAKE SENSE.
This is great, now we have someone to match the greatest of all time “GOAT” gymnast queen. Does anybody else see a problem here?  Glad my children are old enough, I don’t need to explain this.
🇯🇲💯💓
She needs a media(PR) coach. The talent is there.her drive to win is there. Just a little polishing on her choice of wording, and God no profanity
She getting all this press when she finished dead last. Girl got smoked.
look at those piercings lmao
Blonde WEAVE WEARER. WEAR YOUR OWN HAIR.
No accountability
I’m not buying Nike anymore
PRIME EXAMPLE of being raised without a BLACK FATHER in the house.
I love this girl. Her positivity
Yall gassed her up way too much....
She doesn't even make SENSE.
You came in last place, what are gonna do now?   I'm going to Disney World!!
Drug addict clown
Best find a new dealer eh luv.
I love watching her run but hate listening to her talk👎🏾
She’s done , zero humility, has never been humble even in high school she had this immature attitude,  no one knew who she was last year and now she’s not known for sprinting but as the girl that got kicked off the olympics for getting high , the real Shacarri was the one that was talking after the race , this interview she was fake as hell , and as I post this she dropped out of the  200 meters, where’s the confidence and role model talk in this interview smh hopefully she recovers but this has all the makings of the end for her career
We love you !!! You know what it is !!! 6th Fastest of ALL TIME 💯
Needs help with whatever issues shes dealing with. Obviously she's talented but who is her coach? Support system?
God Bless Sha’Carri Richardson! You are awesome and also role model to lots of people like me! I also went through failures and now putting good focused effort to get back.
I'm seeing post saying what she should be, when In actuality all she has to do is win, to make all of what others have to say be silent or jump right back on the band-wagon .#WAGON-HOPPERS
Sha'Carri Rocks, love ❤️ her spirit.
There is nothing we can say that would be more enlightening than the loss she suffered on such a grand scale. It’s going to take sometime for her to understand this wasn’t JUST a loss to extremely fast women, this was a lesson in humility, hard work and determination.
I like nippers piercing
Not a great interview. You would think a professional athele would give a better interview.  Not a fan anyway but she should have just admitted the better women won.  She is a world class athlete but not the best of the best though.  The best athletes won.
She actually got lucky not being able to go to the olympics... cuz there's no way she'd be "socially" where she is today and it obviously got into her head. I don't know if she understands what being humble is anymore or what showing humility looks like. Straight defensive mode, hate if you want blah blah blah. Just sad
I'm really so but I dont like this
Tattoos, blonde weave, nipple piercings.
I'm so glad she was banned for the olympics
Losers do not deserve interviews
Nah...this was her time to shine and she went dull...she failed and she'll never bounce back from this...goes for all usa track stars who loses badly...facts!!

People are clueless about sports and marketing......fast times are not the only way to sell out stadiums, it is characters and Sha'Carri is one of them. It is people with personality and who are willing to put themselves out there that attract viewers, subscribers, bloggers.
Sha carri Richardson  had a layoff watch when she gets her legs back then we will see.🇺🇸🇯🇲
Definitely not a role model.
She's 21...
Keep your head up
This young lady is like a train wreck. And shame on you all for slowing down to watch.
Before the race she said she was not STARSTRUCK ...Big mistake. Respect your competitors.
We need to be more forgiving  people will learn humility  but doing the 'haha' thing just ain't it we have all been humbled before growth happens when your left alone to address your shortcomings instead of defending yourself let her learn and reflect let't not contribute to someone's mental health breakdown and we listen to them in the future talking about how the social media ridicule and bullying caused them to spiral into darkness,drugs and depression and wish we had more compassion.
Oh wow love the piercings
I like her I don't care what nobody has to say. You still #1 I'm my book you can't win them all.
This is what happens when fame comes to fast but she's young and has time to learn from her mistakes
This girl can barely speak fluently and she’s just speaking run on nonsense
WOULD HAVE BEEN COOL TO CONGRATULATE WINNER PERSONALLY:.
Love the classiness
Taking an L by coming in 2nd and 3rd is one thing. 9th place you ain't bringing to the game. All talk.🤦‍♂️
As an American i hate she didn't stay to congratulate the winner. Truly taste that defeat to build your reserve. One day, the loser will have to shake your hand. Dont run from the humiliation.
For someone that came in last she sure talkin a lot of smack! Lol
The comments.. smh. People making her famous even if she never wins.
she'll always be the last loser standing
A positive fighter, she will be fine.
Talk shit get hit I guess.. those who run their mouths generally can’t back it up.
Maybe she should think less of trying to make fashion statements in trying to be in the media and concentrate on her craft and lay off the weed.
Sha'Carri  The Last Place Bender
What if she was paid to lose
It’s about winning races in the end not all the chit chat and gf is making words
She needs to humble herself
Idgaf what *ANYBODY* says about you.. I LOVE YOUR SPIRIT #BlackPride
That’s got the embarrassing lol
Why do people think so not humble
She got some recognition For coming last ;I'm happy for her and on top of everything she big up God .She can do something in public speaking also Blessings hon !
This girl is a blessing and will break all records. She is still learning and developing.
This well NOT end well. She's got the World Championships each year. Possible injury issues that just come with competing. Then there's that dark horse 18, 19 year old American runner that WILL crop up over the next 4 years. Any of these things end up being road blocks and all the "Yes People" around her will bolt and she will be CRUSHED. This is actually a lil scary to watch
the great thing about athletics is that talk is cheap.  shawty you came in dead last. professionals of her supposed talent level don't get skunked like that.  more running fast, and less talking please. i was a fan and now i'm not. she better tighten or kiss her endorsements goodbye
does the NBA interview the bench players that never played after a loss. why is she special
Oh Happy Days Oh Happy Days Poetic Justice like Ricky Bobby who played in Talladega Nights once said if you're not first you're last she lived up to the hype a weave a day keep your edges away
Salty af. She really needs more training n less talking.js
Time...girl Brianna and the Clayton sisters will eat all the food in the future😝
US track and field is overrated, puriod. Lol   NBC hype these folks up and they go out there and get the back doors blown off of them lol 😂
Congratulations to the jamaican winners 😘💕💕..keep your head up Sha'carri 🥰💕💕
A lot of hate for her in the comments. She has a positive attitude - what’s wrong with that?
Is she high now?
Why do these chicks think Raptor claws are cute? 🤦🏽‍♂️
She full a shit Eh
Slo jo.
I wonder why folks can't see this is a Man
Humiliation is part of the ritual  when your a sell out. This is setting her(HIM) up for a huge comeback .
The Yank got smoked! But I still love her response. With that attitude she will do better, but respect the Jamaican queens at all times.
She need a media specialist to help her navigate talking to the media. She also need to stop seeing herself as a performer but a runner. Train harder and say less. I understand her confident spirit though but she need to let her feet do the talking. Say less, do more.
“ For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” - John 3:16
There are people that run great and, there are great runners. YOU are neither! 💯
Haha, you suck! Dead last, big mouth and can’t back it up. Hilarious
#deadlastpack🇯🇲⭐🇯🇲
She needs a publicist
"...grounded"  okay let's spark one up right before the biggest stage of my career.
Girl needs to be more humble!
She got last place and is laughing she ain’t got the mentality for this shit
Baby girl gotta put that phone down. The Bible says that fame draws out the real you.
Childish AF. You a nobody
THE ONLY reason she is so Calm She Gotta Fresh Rollup in the CAR and A Ounce AT 🏡 💯😂
Tbh I really was expecting it to be nigga wearing a wig
She needs to get her head out of the clouds and lay off the bong.  I'm rooting for her and she does have lots of talent, but she sounds wacked out and needs to get serious if she wants to compete with the Jamaicans on the world stage.
If she Comes in Last again,🏃‍♀️ITS OVER😔💯
It's tough watching her interviews, she is grasping for the right things to say and she cannot seem to articulate them in a way that comes across as genuine, authentic or believable. As if she simply wants to appease folks.
Cheater go home
She is 21 and a millionaire girl forget these haters keep up the good work ms lady ugh its always her culture there the worst ijs mane
I don’t want to hear from the person who finished last it’s the winners who deserve the focus in these moments
Ur name is miss unclassy  shacarri
She ran off the track faster than she ran in the race.
Could learn from Alison Felix be humble
She is really high in the weed
She had a taste of humble pie today. And there is more to come until she stop talking so much, put her head down and work.
It's alright winning really isn't everything just stay in the race and keep pressing on , GOD and you got this.
All SHOW and NO GO!  She is a warrior, a looser but a warrior.  I wonder what metal they give to warriors?  Copper maybe?  Wood?
Why do they love these horrible fake hair do's
SHE SAID WHAT SHE SAID PERIOD
I know she can and will run faster times in the future. What I don't like is that she is so focused on what others think of her and proving everyone wrong. Who cares what people think. Just have good sportsmanship, keep it classy, and let your runs times speak. I hope she continues to mature.
SHES ON DRUGS SHE CANT EVEN MAKE SENSE
How was she first on the last race??? And now last? Im confused
Winners Don't Use Drugs. Girl, BYE!
She has Deontay Wilder number
love her confidence
I thought the weed is what guided her through
Definition of crazy
🤣🤣🤣🤣🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
😌😘👸🏾🥰😍😍😍😍
Yep, fake hair, fake nails and fake eye lashes...but ready dressed up for Brazil's Carnival 🤔😆...
We all were young at one time some are mature while young some aren't. She needs to just live and learn maybe she will mature maybe she won't. Only time will tell but I wish her the best. Congratulations Elaine you did that girl❤️❤️❤️ I miss Flo Jo this brought back so many memories. 💔
thats the dirty d for ya
She sound like T.O
Look at those nails...if she picked a booger, she could actually kill herself!  :/
Why is 10th place even being interviewed?! Media has given her more time than the three women that won both races?! What a shame! Hope she doesn't get interviewed again till she places third or better!
I feel like shes trying to convince herself
It was probably that barbell nipple piercing poking through her uniform that slowed her down.
I love her. Please be kind to her, she is just a kid!! Go on and get better ❤️
My wife ❤️😘🥰😍❣️
To Worried about her 🤡 wig and stupid hilarious nails lol..
One min they love you and the next they hate you! Fake love! Stay to yourself take care of your family! Ppl love to see you loose!
What a joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No class…..vulgar attitude…
Genuincy is not a word. Somebody please tell her. Also teach this young woman that arrogance is not confidence.
I xoxo 💞 this girl called Sha'Carri
I used to be a big fan, but it’s hard to be when she’s a bad looser. She’s thinking too much what others think
Oh it was mos def an L...but the rest of that commentary is a result of that L.
The bs is strong with this one!
She's still  STONED!
LAST PLACE IS NOT SUCCESSFUL.
The female Adrian broner
Thats actually 6nine
Nike told her to apologise and chill. Way I see it she got 2 strikes left.
"God has a plan for everything" guess his plan was for her to come in dead last. Honestly i hate when women use that line..
weed does not enhance ish but hunger and sleep...lol
She came in last place, they way she's talking you'd think she placed
Her personality so dope and she fine asf she may have lost but she a winner in my eyes I love my black queens❤️
She threw the race
She still a good runner
I love her, she's genuine and upbeat.
This girl lost her mother right before the Olympic trails made a bad decision because she don't have a good supporting group behind her and got out here to compete shows she need to separate from those people and refocus on here career big ups to her regardless of the out come keep your head up...
She’s so cocky ew
Nipple ring hold yuh back...😂😂team jamaica fam......
Professionals know how to be great winners and even greater losers.  The entire world has never seen past someone’s embarrassed smile and laugh like hers…. 1. Celebrate the winners 2. Admit that it wasn’t your best day. 3. Examine your true enemy within so that you can come back and dominate the next few races.
She is never gonna be able to put the name of the Creator in her mouth and that blonde hair on her head and those fake ass long ass slow ass nails and lashes in her and succeed...she will spiral into depression until she chooses one or the other
Those Jamaicans didn't get any good until they started doping. If they're so proud of their country why do they train in the United States? Yes they have some dominant female sprinters but the rest of the team is not very good. Check the medal count for the Olympics  track event, the United States dominated them. I'm proud of all Black people I just don't like the ones that brag and talk s*** against the United States. Our country is not perfect but we sure have a bunch of people breaking their necks to get in here.
Is God, Jesus Christ? You have to ask these days.  Lord help us all.
She just shows the American culture and we should learned about it
Garbage athlete who shouts racism for her own stupidity of doing drugs before an event
She losing the race is not what makes her situation messed up ,it's her attitude that sucks,her inability to be humble.....everything about her in this interview is fake
“Can’t sit and dwell” YES YES YES.  Trauma has taught me that. Even trauma, you gotta let it go in order to move away from it. The front and future is always there.  Congrats ShaCarri, you will be fine in life.
Weed makes you a loser
Shut yuh bombo wid u nonsense
Please you talked all that junk and when it time to perform you didn't.  Hell one of the Jamaica runners was 36 years old. You will never come back.  Because you can't put the weed down . I hope they take all of your endorsement.
That piercing is hot asf
Very big L
Built like a dude
I guess it really wasn't a "performance enhancing drug" hahaha!!
That piercing is poking through
Amen baby
God has a plan for you to come last. Lol all those fake shit slow u down.😜
Every track person knows you dont lose like that after a month, after you had beat them before!!!!!!
Still love her... hopefully this experience will help her become more focused and mature
Why they gotta be Rachetness in the olympics too?
ANOTHER BEN JOHNSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fake nails, fake hair, fake eyelashes, inauthentic interview…representing modern women. What a clown. Soooo unfortunate
She got EXPOSED !!!! HER STEROID  JUICE RAN OUT OF HER SYSTEM!!!!!! LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please I’m begging you if you have anymore race with Jamaicans in it just don’t show up because you just gonna keep on coming last
To all the haters... keep that same energy.
She is devastated   I can tell....  she's a Wreck
Sha'carri's  positive attitude, that's great!
10:54 by jamaicans ! she can not beat them up!
That blonde hair is a no no for me
Ta'carri 69 of the olympic  . Sources confirm shes getting 6th place tattood on her forehead
she is very embarrassed after the jamaicans smashed her~ sad
I love her confidence. I hope she don’t let social media break her down with the memes and jokes. Yes, it was a “humbling” experience, but y’all don’t have to tear her down.
This is the society we live in; social media gratification for some but the true winners are not even in front of the camera talking.  They are too busy working while letting their actions and accomplishments do the talking.
Wtf is this thing
As a person who loves sports and likes stories. If i was her I would get off social media and any distraction. She needs to grow up and find the right people to help her.
Sorry u  are not  flo jo
Why does she sound like she hasn’t sat ONE DAY in ANYONE’s college..?!  Wow…”finna”.. SMH
Rude, she rude.  Orange hair Gal, she head look like carpet 😂😂😂
Halloween party, scary looking nails and wig. Got loads of talent but persona is a distraction
IBTC
Shout out Dallas but you got smoked 💨💨💨💨
Avoid the the medication young lady.
Mi say she feel hert but a no earthquake 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Her arrogance  over powers  her smile.  She needs a image consultant.
Lose the props baby
Passion for smoking
What a joke she is 😂 she acts like everyone wasn’t laughing at her when she got dead last. COMEDY
Pierced niplles huh
Stop talking and just work
F*** all the haters! Her CONFIDENCE is great to see. Social media haters love to step on u when ur dwn but she wont let it happen. #respect.
It's alright to be strong but not over confident it's okay to cry even the great did it like Michael Jordan he cried when he lost and it made him better
It's hard to keep a disappointment face but she love women was no typo
Don’t smoke bongs before a race!
It’s okay you lost the race babe just come back home we gone roll us a blunt and I’m gone rub yo feet while we watch movies 😂 ❤️
DO YOUR TALKING ON THE TRACK GIRL.
Why she keep gigling wenever she's been interview though? ??
Your wig, nails plus crack cocaine didn’t help lol
She needs mentorship .. she was out performed and out classed .. she makes black American women look bad by the way she carry herself. I hope she recovers and comes back better
I feel bad for her... But she gots to stop talking smack because  she can't back it up right now and the Jamaicans are not ones to mess with... Track fieled is in their blood from kindergarten and up.. If she stay focus she can bounce back.   She is making track and field more interesting now!!
So pretty 😊💕 keep going girl 🙏
At the end of the day (WE)🤏🏾🤏🏽🤏🏿Still win regardless ✊🏿✊🏽✊🏾 Can’t loose when (WE) 🤏🏽🤏🏽🤏🏿the only competition 💯No losses here!
She's done
You win some You lose some  You learn more from a lost than you do from a win keep going 💯
Her team should’ve made sure she had enough time to process that loss before the first interview
All these women are drug tf off
i aint gon lie....i like her and i wish her well
Those long nails generated too much downforce and drag...it was like watching a Christmas tree.
Unbelievable arrogance.
Damn maybe if she got a little more educated and got rid of the big ghetto fingernails and stopped playing a victim she would finish higher.
Maybe if she didn't have a whole wig on! I get she wants to look cute, but shouldn't she be trying to go as fast as possible?
That laugh and her voice is so sexy ❤️
No one is talking about the Jamaican men 🤔
ur telling me the Jamacian runners dont smoke herb?
You know someone's dumb when they sound like a hype video lol.
Damn damn damn
I’m a warrior! A losing warrior, but still a warrior!
I can't wait until next season. She was robbed this year. Sure she has attitude problems but not everyone is that great attitude, lovey dovey, try to please everybody person. Could she shake hands and give side hugs after the race? Sure. Something people fail to realize is Usain Bolt almost never did that after a race. Sure he was lightyears ahead but he always immediately went into a victory lap and posing situation. Usually it would have to be someone tracking him down at the next straightaway before he shook hands or gave hugs.
Stop hating she just came back
I should keep my mouth shut lmfao
Lol
She did that on purpose she is definitely faster than those ladies
Garbage when it counted most.Then a ghetto attitude afterward
She giving adrien broner vibes 😬😬😬
Someone seriously needs to help her, guide. The blonde wig, the nails, the lashes, the ghetto, Jesus. You do not see white young women looking like that in the sports world.  Why? Why? Why? We have to start calling out these things. Her way of talking , can we start telling black women the truth ? This isn’t confidence, it’s arrogance and I know she’s young but the world doesn’t owe us anything.  I just can’t.
Who was running ? Shacarri or Shakira ???  Shacarri has a bad shakra. Track & Fields is neither about make up nor arrogancy. She should humble herself and stay away from drugs and negative people. The demonstration people are expecting from her is performance, not verbosity!
Look at all these so-called proud Jamaicans in their American homes spending their money in American stores and paying American taxes. How ironic 🤣
I’m still rooting for u girlllll. There’s a lot of time to learn. Keep working and u gon be up there!
She's still grieving. Let her get fully back in routine. Cause as of right now she's making Marijuana look like a ped 😂😂
Smokers don’t run as fast as non smokers, something to do with lung capacity……,,it’s science.
Transvestite 📢
All the horse hair is getting to her head.......
Congratulations Ladies . Love track and Happy for all these ladies . I'm a huge Sha'carri fan . Still rooting for her . Everyone of these ladies are talented.
To beat the jamaicans  is going to be a tough challenge as theyve been training and putting in hard work making sure they stay at the top of their game
Her Body looked heavy when she was running
This girl represents IDIOTS in the world....as my dad would say....STUPID.....SHOULD HURT......If your not first your last...except when your REALLY LAST.....
Let this be a good lesson to her and all other athletes
Well with nails the length of hers, she OBVIOUSLY doesn't do any real work ...............
Nah she thought about that Nike $$$. Stop making excuses for bs. You came in last and then pulled out the 200. Lemme guess she gonna blame mental health for that too?
This is as bad if not much worse than watching an Horrific American Idol audition then hearing the interview by Ryan Seacrest with them how great of a Singer they Think they are. ON GOD!
Plot Twist: She had to be last ,because that's the Asian culture cause she messed UP... But now she's ABOUT TO GO H.A.M... she definitely doesn't need to explain that !
She hada humble her self in this interview way  way different then her ghetto meltdown video
I was a dumbass when I was 21 too.  Give her a break.
Worry less about showmanship and more on sportsmanship....and lets add this one too...worry less about hair, nails, and eye glitter and more about training for the race.
I love her spirit. She is a true warrior. I wish her the best...
For accurate tarot prediction on success and love that truly resonates, join us at http://www.youtube.com/c/SuccessAndLoveTarot
She’s so young. Trying to be what she thinks she’s supposed to be. Props to the women who all ran faster. It’s a testimony to their hard work and talent. But, a career is more than one race. My prayers are for ALL of them to thrive.
She has experienced some significant abuse, which has then resulted in her abusing many things. Time will only tell if she can ever pull it all together.
She rlly needs to be humble
No one told her to smoke that thing she trying not cry for a long time
What is it with her big eyelashes and nails. Maybe if she didn't have them, she would have run faster, rather than being a total loser.
She is trying so hard to be positive, we will not forget that you got smoked 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. I know Americans hate us for doing this but you said nothing when she was running her mouth and disrespecting the great Jamaican sprinters. I want her to keep on running her mouth I really don't want her to stop, so that the ass whooping doest stop as well. #9 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.
Needed a blunt.
Let's see: Humility = 0  Self-reflection = 0 Narcissism = 100 Sportsmanship = 0 Arrogance = 100 Grace = 0. Yup this is definitely a US athlete. Probably some drugs involved too.
She tries to over explain things, she is the best she had a bad day that is all, She needs to work on her starts and she will be breaking records
👸🏾💕💞💕
Lmfaoooooooo LAST
Typical of the new generation.......concentrating on the wrong things like weed.......talkin loud.......the latest fashion, everything but the task at hand. Career overwith
She will never beat the Jamaican girls,  and she has to learn to  accept  it
She’ll be alright. She just got back to work. Give her a race or two more.
Better interview but try to keep the microphone away from her 4 a lil while!!
Honestly I hope she gets off the weed, because she is just talking right now. but if she dedicates herself to her art she will be fine. I'm behind you all the way head up and make sure that support system is supporting you. Please!
Blood, sweat, tears...beers and bud...feeling the love...I'm a warrior. Please, spare me.
🙈🙈🙈you ended being last in the race😂😂😂😂😂
The jamaican girl's got momentum now, but this is what's all about and want...a competition.  It feels like Ben Johnson vs Carl Lewis and we haven't had that in a while because Usain Bolt had no competition.  I know this girl is going to combat back and make it exciting but I see the Jamaican very hard to dethrone for now.  ShaCarri is still young and learning.
“I feel delicious” - LOL I love her authenticity! Continue being yourself. Someone will always try to dim your passion.
Hmm somebody told her to get her shit together but I feel like she's doing toovmych still
Her lips move faster than her legs....she should hop into rap😂 😂 😂 Playing the colour victim card...
Clearly all the psychological sessions haven’t worked.  Now she’ll go home and ball her eyes out.
guess that weed did hit differently lmao
She didn’t even try. She gave up. She should’ve just stayed home or faked an injury during the race. Smh.
FAKE!!!!!!
Sha'Cringy Richardson ladies and gentlemen.
Being Humble is the 🔑.
Ok now this the vedio that needs to viral. I see a different side of her I'm not sure if her team is behind her doing this but this needed to be done. This is a learning experience for her now go and train harder stay off social media running your mouth and focus on you.
I still love her u win some u lose some she just going thru something her focus gone off alot her mother pass that will bring u down alot for long long long time ...jamica was just more focus good job sha no hating over here babygirl👍🏾
She sounds like she is stoned
Her losing looks like a media tactic to me.
Look at those nails 😂😂😂
All that talk for last
Give her a brake this is her first race in more then a month with time she will be back on top of her game stop the hate
A guess it’s the weed that was making u run that fast after all 🤭
She only talked about herself nothing about the sport or why she didn't perform that social media bug got her she didn't train for this at all look how she got out of the blocks congrats to the winners
The fact she is signed to nike and Allyson Felix got dropped tells it all
This is a better interview! She should have had this energy after the race. Maturity needed so I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt! She’s definitely confident which is good. Definitely has more ability and has proved it historically… Prefontaine was a very bad day at the office!
Girl lied to herself and looks like she will keep doing it
She took this L personality 😭😂
The GEN U EN CY....WHAT 😳.
Black people in America love to criticize  another black persons loss. We don't route for each other like other people do. That's why we're behind
It’s crazy because if she wasn’t talking all that shit people wouldn’t be on her so hard.
She desperately needs coaching in interviewing.
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
What is it about ppl who NEED other ppl to be humble. Sports would be EXTREMELY BORING if every athlete was humble. Let ppl be who they are. Let this 21 year old come back better next time instead of trying to fit her in your box.
Richardson just dropped an enormous turd but can't own it.  Pathetic.
The Voice
only if she had practiced on her running as much as she did on her denial sore losers speech she might of finished 7th instead of dead last!!!!!!
Put your greatness to actuality, your trying to sound confident but if you actually were confident you would hve congratulate the winning of the race you participated into , talking about yourself only may work on social media, proving your ability is the reality.
And beside that sha carri already ran with those ladies Elaine and Fraser price wasn’t there she smoked all of them I think she was going through so much and she just comeback on the track she is not going to perform the same way that she used to do before give her some time she will definitely make a comeback
She's still da bomb! 💪. Nice head on her shoulders!! She'll be back!!
Results… sometimes harsh, always true!
I love this woman. God Bless u Queen
She don’t need a media coach or anything, just like I don’t care how I’m typing this comment when I know grammar. She’s herself, human.. and y’all get the point. Y’all keep talking about nervous.. she knows she has a lot of people waiting to see her fail and has to watch her words instead of saying what she wants to say. I saw a positive, WARRIOR like she said. Growing at her own pace. It’s all a process, keep your focus young Queen.
Them Jamaicans are built differently, sis.
Wow what a strange girl
This young lady has no humility much to her detriment..She needs to use her legs the way she uses her mouth
Her coach as to do a better job of surrounding her with the right support systems. Not enablers looking to capitalize.
She need to refocused that’s all
Elaine Thompson was not  Fast like that before she worked hard and become great me as a runner I believe in sha carri Richardson she has so much confidence in herself and motivated if she work hard she will become one of the greatest sprinter
I heard her eye lashes where trying to make her fly instead of run
I heard her hair caused to much downforce
I heard her nails messed up her aerodynamics
Use this as a humbling motivating experience. Get back in the lab and you’ll be back at the top.
Yea we know what u need to do smoke.lol
Man, this is the result of a young person being completely absorbed with social media. Literally can only keep her gigantic mobile computer out of her hands for the 11 seconds it takes her to run the hundo
WTF wrong with this little girl?  Where is her positive influence?  Her interviews are a cringe and she seems so hostel and combative....  Doesn't seem she's learning at all ..👎🏾
😳😳
You talk, Floyd Mayweather type of shit, you better be ready to back it up, she needs to humble herself  work hard, she's should be embarrassed, she got knock the fuck out  in the 1st round, dead last, so the arrogant comment, about the Olympic's, You miss me Yet, well Sha'carri what do you think??
Trash 🗑
Dear ShaCarrie, Humbleness, meekness and gentleness costs nothing. Your own actions will speak louder than words... Next time you come 1st from behind just tell the press, "NO COMMENT" I'LL BE BACK.
Nice work humiliating yourself, Sha'Clowny!
Great attitude! She is young!
She will still run her mouth even in her next 3 races, best finish in the next year 5th place, maybe
She needed that joint
Awwww. I love this young lady. I just want to give her a hug. Keep pushing and believing beautiful! We ain't seen nothing yet! You are STILL THAT GIRL!
Awesome! Keep your head up. USA
the caption !!! petty asfff
She has youth on her side, she'll beat them soon
LOL THATS WHAT U GET.....STOP TRYING TO DAMN HARD TO BE LIKED
😅😂😂😂😂
Sha'carri Richardson the only thing fast on you is your mouth 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
She got her ass whipped by them Jamaicans . They been doing this she just arrived
It’s a bit nipply apparently! Also what are those nails? How can that be comfortable to wipe your ass? And who finds them attractive?
I think she redeemed herself a bit. She is just bit too self indulgent.
Sweetie has talent, yet she needs to learn, understand & practice humility…. Grow baby!!
Go train harder that's it
She speak the truth. I really wish her the best,  God know..... She just need to mature.
Ain't no come back from this😆
Good luck against the Jamaicans. You are going to need longer hair and nails to help you!   Maybe call 619 for hair ideas.
This girl is such an embarrassment. She doesn't know how to talk or verbalize anything. She it she knows that and she's uncomfortable giving interviews.
She need to go check glen mills to start win some races
Congrats to Elaine and Shelly, I do hope Shacari's management team gets her some mental health support, she is struggling but doing the only thing she knows fight back how she can, the media and supporters can make and break you, I am not sure if she was ready for what just happen. I do hope she can build back with the lesson of humility and make her way back.
Keep shut
She talk 2 much she should compete  in the talking competition
The entire race run leave u
Love this interview
God bless you my child, you are a STAR and you know it, keep the faith even though it was my Jamerican girls who beat you, you are my sister, God bless you
Nasty girls not like it.
Many of yall created this..hold that L along with her
She needed that now stfu🤫
She really needs help and guidance with interviewing skills and professionalism. It will truly serve her well.
She is currently working on her book "101 ways to embarrass yourself"
Our Black Jamaicans stand up Good job ladies
All that damn weave
Should should have just congratulated them and kept moving. So embarrassing
What a total joke! She's competing with her long ass hair down long ass nails she's clearly there to fuck off not win.
This young girl needs mentoring.
Peace, Love to all.  Why is that so  many people are so negative and make assumptions. How can you all just throw people under the bus like that. You put  out what you put in. Everybody know that right I hope so.  Most of you all comments are such on a low vibration. You can tell how many think and how you live.  The Majority of you all spiritual energy sucks.  I see qualities of demonic energies on here. I want all the people talking so negative talk about your skeletons you got hidden in the closet before you judge someone else.  So quick to judge someone instead of judging yourselves.  This world is beautiful but so many lost souls or fallen ones  use their low vibrational energy to do evil.  Congratulations on the winners and may the Creator bless all of them and you all know that some reporters are up to no good always got to make that story even if it hurts the one they are interviewing.
ShaCarri who??
This girl's got a huge chip on her shoulder for which she is going all out to compensate for. Beneath the tough exterior inside she is soft and weak af and tbh coming into this race - placed right between ETH and SFP, and with SJ just two lanes away - she knew she wasn't gonna beat any of them. What she didn't expect was to finish dead last. LOL
She baaaad tho 😏😎
Who cares if she cry’s she’s that passionate enough!!!  making money doing something she loves!!! of course she’s going to cry... I’m tired of you disgusting people hating on this beautiful women!
“It’s time to get back in the LAB” 👀😳???
She's just greatfull to be back and able to run again 🙏 love her Grit and determination. Can't win em all but Long as you know you can win that matters🥂 Less Go Shaccarii Never quit
Let's not forget the last race she lost was against Asher Smith..... her biggest enemies are herself and them 4 women. 🤣😂😁 don't forget about Tori..
If you DONT have anything in your life that brings out the emotions AND strength and passion then you need to find it! This girl has something to prove now! I'm here for it!!!
Running between 2 Jamaicans made her look slow....smh poor thing.
Her agent grabbed her aside and read her the riot act......this was the result....a desperate need to act normal....sorry, it doesn't work.
She has a very slow start  when she look up the weed in her system slow her blood level down her mind was ready but her blood level wasnt thats want happen no way 9th place
She talk too much that's why she lost.......humble calf suck the most milk she need Fi sshhhhh #disrespectfuly
Her mouth runs faster than she does.
Them Jamaican girls ain’t try to hear Jack from this girl.
Shacarri got SMOKED 😂 but she is great. Take this L and comeback Queen!
For all the negative comments; you still came here to watch her talk. You are a fan and you dont even know it. This is a great show; just appreciate it!😂
To be successful u first need to humble yourself and that's what she's lacking
This girl needs help if u ask me #hhpe much 🙄
Can’t help feel like she’s overcompensating here. For her sake, I hope she believes these words for herself. Also, Shelly-Anne is such a great speaker as well as an athlete, I hope Sha’carri learns from her in all aspects.
Message to Sha'Carri: Let that loss, last place, or rock bottom be your trampoline👊💪Bounce back baby. Their is GREATNESS in you🎖🎖
Hopefully she apologizes to Gabby
We lose some and we win some, we people expect much from people but not expect much from ourselves to grow as people and take mistakes and lessons with us. She’s strong, good for her :)
Love her confidence. Rooting for Sha'Carri to prove all the detractors wrong at next year's World Championships
Good on her , You have to stay confident at this level,  Everyone knows she will be the fastest female on the plant , Being positive after being blown away is champ material.
“That girl” has confidence which is great but so is humility.
She’s very annoying.
#SoreLoser 😄👎🏿
Less fake nails, fake eyelashes, hair dyeing, and tattoos...and more work. She needs to grow up.
You "love women"?🤔
perfect american narcissism
Sha’ Carri need to discipline herself and humble her mouth she is too much for herself. #Toohype! I pray for her…
She Wasn't Focus seem like she had to much on her mind Winning Mindset I Like It she's Beautiful
Wow...9th place..Sha'carri who?????  She needs to learn to shut up and quit the childish trash talking.....she got outclassed by this field in more ways than one
Can’t be humble in defeat?
Disgusting nails
Jokes on yu chocked at her chance of gold n choked in front of the world jst den she a joke
That nipple ring weighed her down.
"Congratulations to the women that won", and two of those women are sprint legends....such disrespect, pretending like she does not know their names!
Even the Greatest Athletes have lost. Kobe, Michael Jordan, Lebron. Don’t be afraid to show your emotions. She will learn from this and Grow from her loss.
Continue to hold your head up hi. There were others who were banned as well in the past, including the 🇯🇲 girls. You are back, stay 💪, focus and we will be watching for your win. God is with you.
She’s broken.
If no have no shame was a person it would me you little girl in last place with such a smile.
This is the peoples fault for feeding into her ego when she got disqaulified from the olympics. Lol
She playing yall. She gone make yall eat all your negative words.
I am glad she lost this one. I think it will save her from herself and I believe if she is as strong as she poses, she will be back with a vengeance.  We all know she can do better. She may not have won, but she could have well medaled had shw focused on being an athlete than a celebrity.
She probably cried when she got alone, this is fake confidence.
Can someone please do a well check on her
🤣🤣🤣🤣
She is a warrior!.....last place warrior!
Got smoked like a blunt on 4/20 smh
it wasn't this time, but God and you know when the day is. You have a mark of an incredible 10.63 everyone knows that that can be improved. That day will come and it will be very proto despite your 21 years.
You too full of yourself and chat too much!!!! Humble yourself then maybe you will see success on the world stage!!!!
How can people say how she feel though 😂 She not letting nobody see her sweat she goin take her L and Learn from it. I don't lose I either win or learn and that's what she expressing that she goin always be a winner regardless of someone else's opinion as she should feel. At least she not on TV crying about it now then people would call her weak and embarrassed by that but because she's keeping her head held high and moving forward people still has alot to say. Rather you doin good or bad people still goin talk so it's like who cares that's good she don't let people get to her and disturb her peace of mind. Anyways congrats to the winner but honestly all you ladies are winners. #KeepBeingGreat💯❤️
She consecutive she gone bounce back I can tell
I think those big fake nails slowed her down or maybe those huge wing eye lashes
How hard was she training since suspension? Was she just into the limelight and hype since? As Usain said "you got to put in the work". Usain got beaten by Yohan at the Jamaican trials right in his prime. Didn't say much. He refocused and the rest is history.
I thought this young female went to college/university. I thought she went to LSU. Why does she present herself as an uneducated mascot?
Chicks pierce any type of titties nowadays smh
What does humility and humbling herself have to do with her progression to greatness... If she doesn't motivate herself in the eyes of the "they-sayer" and come off undefeated regardless the endeavor, she would fail her own process.
All bark no bite
She a product of black twitter
Sis you too cocky. Humble yourself. Talking tooo much. You full ah chats, quotes and everything but you can't back it up. Periodddddd
Is she serious 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩 she will never 🏃🏽‍♀️ beat a Jamaican woman  in track and field for ever ever 😁😩😂😭😭😭
Better interview SC. Don't get too caught up in the heat of the moment.
Dam baby girl ..just hit the blunt..u Tripping..
She's trying to show confidence but I see hurt, embarrassment and a lot of FEAR. She can talk the talk but can she run the race?
pride comes before downfall u must humble yourself first
I LOVE U SHA'CARRI!!! Win or lose u are STILL an OVERCOMER and a child of God! Continue to train hard, work hard and IT. WILL. COME! I believe in u and u are an inspiration. Even to me, a woman, wife, mother, sister, who's old enough to be your mom. Thank u for encouraging ME! 💯💜 #KeepRunning 🏃🏼‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️
I thought like everyone she would have a good showing at this meet ,but as we see big bank take little bank,what ever shes doing anit working meaning Ms Richardson, i think Mrs Thompson is capable of running a faster time than 10.5 maybe wear looking at a 10.3 in the future.
Bad weed
I love her, it is what it is, she can only become greater
😄 Lol that is why i love me some Shelly Ann Fraser, her personality. So they are interviewing ShaCarri after the race; so Shelly Ann goes bye looks at the camera and shakes her head up and down looking at ShaCarri ( like saying yeah talking all that trash and finishing dead last 😄). As for the winner Elain Thompson 🥇💪👍❤, Flojo has always been my favorite, but is there anybody that could break Flojo record is Elain, not even close the rest of girls. ❤👍💪 My Shelly Ann i hope you are not even thinking about retirement, because you still got it. 123 easy as ABC, Respect to my 3 Jamaican Queens, including Sharika Jackson. ShaCarri needs to zip it just a bit, get on the track and win, BECAUSE SHE IS VERY CAPABLE; but ShaCarri reminds me of a girl who lost a street fight, as always they talking all that *, you know the rest. Overall this was a great performance put on by all the athletes, and a BIG THANKS TO ALL THE SPECTATORS THAT CAME OUT TO SUPPORT THE ATHLETES, WHICH I COULD BE THERE, 👍❤🔥💪. Pura Vida
Don't worry, there is always another day
She will come back stronger
Overrated
A complete Buffoon.    P.S- Flo Joy had ridiculously long nails but she had CLASS!!
This was well spoken🙌🏾🙏🏽 I wanna see her win.
Gal you come dead dead lassssttttttt
I think success would be the absolute worst thing for this young Sister. That act is to cover up deeper issues than losing a race. She needs to hit rock bottom to reassess her life. Her inner pain and insecurities, mixed with fame and fortune, will wind up destroying her. I hope someone, without an ulterior motive or hidden agenda, can help guide her on her journey to self-discovery and inner peace.
She needs someone to help her with speech, so she can come across more mature. She sounds younger than her age. Other than that she shook off the rust and she will bounce back.
Her 15 minutes of fame will be over soon
THE BIGGEST !!!!!!! we all know what you’re capable of and WE GONE STUCK BESIDE YOU
She talks to much
not likable.
She sounds like Lil AGZ “Say-less”
I love her, I don't care and when she bounce back yall better not hop on her wagon like yall did before!
This girl need help……😂 She really thought she was gonna pass the Jamaicans 🤣🤣 not even in her sleep.
You're so young, your day will come. Don't ever lose that positive attitude.
Looking forward to seeing her on a world star video
“Smoke weed erry day”. Nate Dogg
Glad this was not the Olympic 100m final!
NOW she wants to be humble.. AFTER she lost. That’s not how it works babe. Should’ve been humble from the beginning.. Still wish her the best tho.
grown ass people that doesn't have any talent always has something to say...this lady is 21 give her your support because if she was winning you would be saying something else! Keep God first in your life and try to keep all these old doing nothing haters at bay.
L
Heat of Passion, Genuincy, she felt Delicious, she's a performer and she loves all Women of Flag 😂😂😂.
Next time stay out  the way of the Jamaica women's them on you will not get run over sha'carri Richardson 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
I can appreciate the positive  attitude. She fell off bad and that solely rest on her shoulders. The good thing is that she acknowledges it. People process adversity different. She's putting on a game face and that's great because she knows much greater is in her. Some athletes are short with the media or get irritated with questions after a terrible  performance.  Good job Shakari!!!!👍🏾 You'll be back!
Sha'Carrie is clearly talented and she can do better but she has lost focus. She needs to stop engaging online so much and focus on running. She was just not prepared at all for these women who just returned from the Olympics who are in great shape. She was too busy being an influencer. She can bounce back if she regains focus. She is only 21. Congrats to the Jamaicans and good luck to Sha'Carrie. Hopefully she someone will advise her on how to stay focused
She wants fame
She could have shed off a few kilos by taking off the wig and those fake nails. The less the weight the faster you go.
Seems to me her job is to prove people wrong and not actually winning
Shes acts like a child compared to her competitors
"I am my biggest enemy."
👁 Spy with my Little 👁 2 matching piercings!!!  😝
U should have tied back that hair ...then u would have a🤭😑😒tleast come fifth ...
That young woman needs therapy. I understand she's young but it's like no one is watching out for this young woman. I'm more concerned with her mental state. She needs to live in reality and all that trash talk after losing is pure silliness. Her press conference was unnecessary and ridiculous, can we hear from the winners instead?
Richardson you were seeing the Jamaican 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲 not them seeing you they put you in reverse brap brap 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
One thing I do know the bible says in Matthew 20:16 the last shall be first an the first shall be last,many are called but few are chosen!!stay strong sweetie bless!!👑💪💕 Sha,Carri Richardson
She good just need to get in that pool and train.
Humbleness take you through the world. She run her mouth too much to get embarrassed like that. Great job to the 123 team.
Smoked, that hashish too.
I do not see the issue with this interview.....y'all took ONE thing she said and ran with it. She spent most of this interview saying she's thankful for being there and that it'll be better the next time and congratulating other women but "sHe nEeD tO hUmBLe hErSeLf" 🙄🙄🙄🙄 y'all  need to just say y'all hate Black women and go. Smfh.
Anxiety or Depression or Both.
if I didn't see the first 5 seconds of this video, I would've thought she didn't care at all.
Sha'carri Richardson you count out your self because you come dead last because you chat too much 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
I don’t know where this “she needs to humble herself” BS comes from. People love to see others on their knees. Sha’carry needs to stop talking less,  train more and try her best.
This girl needs help.
Time to smoke a last place congratulatory blunt 👍
People hate to see a black women with Confidence in self…it’s ridiculous! 🤨 GOOD JOB GIRL KEEP GOIN NO MATTER WHAT!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
"Gwope innah the truck"😂😂
Abara tholikatty thanne........
The ‘world’ will lift you up and let you down. But, the ‘word’ stand forever!  U GO GIRL! *MD
She’s going to cry in the car.
Shhhhhh….
TAKE A LOAD OFF YOUR BODY TO GO FASTER,  TOO MUCH HAIR, TOO MUCH NAIL,TOO MUCH HYPE!!
She has been humbled…she is speaking words of life to herself and good for her, because a loss like this after a comeback can lead to depression. She can cry it out in prívate and then come back and thrive after it. Be better. Do better. Grow.
Sha’Carri Richardson is going to shock the world!
At least she responded with class.
i wish her well. if she  trains and stay focus she will do good.
She don't represent me
She is so ghetto
Why is she and everyone else calling this a comeback? She was suspended for 30 days. Not a year. She could’ve/should’ve been training the whole time behind the scenes instead of trying to prove to the world via Twitter that she’s that chick
This is what I wanted to hear!  She’s dam good, she just wasn’t her best at that time.  We all have to take a fall, but you learn, get up and go.  Like she said “get back in the lab.”
I think she's under a lot of scrutiny. All over the internet world suspicions are that she was a male. She's knocking World Records OFF THE BLOCK !!! Before a transgender scandal starts, I think they rig it and made her lose a race. Or she failed a steroid test. And they put it on marijuana. Or both. Because they body slamming her a$$. See if people start complaining, their gonna start forcing transgenders to compete with 👨 males. You want to be a 👧 girl, but you still got some of your 👨 male strength. If I'm in the Olympics, and I trained hard for years, it's not fair that I come in 2nd place to a male transgender. With God given strength over me. I rightfully deserve the gold. But you you're in the headlines with a gold medal on your neck. Beating all the females and suppressing your true identity. Not fair. You need to race with the 👦 boys. The girls can't beat you. Ever. "STAY IN YOUR LANE!!!"
I feel all what she is saying… She said “She is her own worse enemy” “There aren’t any excuses” half of the people on these comments aren’t even real athletes… Remember my comment when I tell y’all she’s coming back and I mean coming strong…
Career Over
What the hell is she going on about
She had balls to go out there. She obviously ran and practiced before this race, she knew she would run the time she ran. I commend her for going out there.
Congrats on 9 th place lol 😂
Substance over style always prevail.  If she won it would of been praises to god in loosing the same god has a plan,give me a break.
I'm happy she's back racing again. Forget all the haters. That girl is awesome and the future of the sport.
Humble yourself
I am rooting for this kid. Congrats to the Jamaican sprinters.  .
🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸
How sweet it is this made my day shaweed Richardson lol lol lol he must still be high lol lol lol dead last hahahahahaha  hahahahahaha hahahahahaha hahahahahaha for all you that were advocating for her to be sent to the Olympics  lol lol lol hahahahaha  hahahahahaha she sucks hahahahahaha  hahahahahaha
Going forward behind...at the back
How could anyone say she is not humble?? She accepts losses in stride and give all Roses to her opponents that won against them.
Congrats to all ladies 💯💯💯
Proud of my fellow Jamaicans. Elaine, Shelley-Ann and Shericka did all their talking where it mattered. Big-up also for Briana. If Sha’Carri can focus like Elaine and Shelley-Ann and stay off social media she will come good over the next few years.
Shes just running her mouth to make millions that way, not for her talent but by running her UN humble mine set, now everybody is going to interview her and make money in a different way by not winning... understand that, she's not the best but that's the way she makes money, running her idiot mine set.
Just goes to show that we are all at the mercy of the media. I've yet to see one video or interview of the winners. Interviewing the last place runner that is more into make up and tattoos while smoking pot is more important. She is done because she doesn't have the focus and drive to be a champion.
This interview was better because the last one ☝️ she seems to be rushing and talking so fast. She was definitely nervous 😬 but I like her being positive and congratulating the other girls. Keep running Sha ‘ cari, I am cheering for you.
That was painful to watch. This interview was way too long. She looked and sounded uncomfortable. Let’s see what the future holds. But right now she can’t compete with those other girls.
Going forward she can't possibly finish worst than this dead last result. At least she got that going for her in the future. If she learns from her mistakes and everything goes her way she will be racing for third. Those Jamaican ladies are on another level and ain't going anywhere for a while.
You don’t represent us. We are athletes who don’t smoke weed and are humble
I am ashamed as a woman since she so call love woman. She is not humble at all. She knows the names of the women who beat her. She needs prayer.
She has a passion for that sticky icky  Jokes on us??? Yeah, ok.
She talks too much. 🤐
Jason Whitlock called her out correctly.
Keep On With The Keeping’On….Work Hard & Live With Those Future Results….Keep Yo’ Head’Up and the other Amazing Queens Too…!!!
Never know that a last place finishher can get so much interviews. Well, congratulations to Ms Richardson for being the 6th fastest last place finisher in 100m race for females in history. Big up Nike you guys have history maker in the camp.
Stay up✌🏾💚
I wish the little sister the best but her and her team better get things turned around pretty quick . The competition obviously isn’t standing still , or smoking weed.
A LA Lewis sista this ?
Shout out to George Floyd on fifteen months of sobriety. It took some tough love but he did it. Say his name liberals🖕
Sha’Weed
Who is the idiot brotha walking by congratulating her for coming in last. What a sick society we live in.
PED written all over this..Used the Weed as a Cop out right before Olympics..She knew the Testing would be all over her at Olympics !! #STANDBYE
There’s a fine line between confidence and arrogance…
come in last place. in a warrior 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This little girl has absolutely no class
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 joke!!!
Come back strong mama
just be happy for di from queen Jamaica 🇯🇲
Keep believing in yourself...,.
Excuses , needs to grow up..
There's no haters you comes last 💯.
Let your walk do the talking!... or else you're not going to make it.
She gay now she love women smh this a Dame same
Damage controlled. Lesson learned.
Someone just told her this right after this race.. She talk all that ish, even said USA was missing her. She has a long way to go, stop playing and take it serious. There is always someone waiting to take your spot and they did
Talent still needs hardwork, nurturing and discipline. I hope she knows that.
Very poor sportsmanship Lack of humility Lack of authenticity  Arrogance  Conceited  Equals A Loser NOOOOOOOOOOO  you are not a representation of me or mine.  Get it right Shacarrie is obviously not ready.& .very immature.
Adrien Broner sister she did it for the hood lol!!
If y'all don't leave this woman alone..what the hell was y'all doin at 21 or NOW for that matter to even have an opinion on what she doin! You never had this exposure In yo LIFE! Calm down Calm down! Sha'Carri you're Beautiful and already a Champion...you on God's Pace not theirs.. Love That!
She's so ratchet lol. All the hype is distracting her. She need to focus on her purpose and not get caught up in the sauce
Im here trying to figure out why did she stop running half way against the Jamaicans. The last half of the race is her Strength...What do yall think...was it the pressure?
Nope ..joke is on you Be humble.. You'll run faster..ask them Jamaican girls
If y'all can't see that this is a MAN, you're blind
Uh embarrassing
Big Up Jamaica it’s the food we eat Mon 😝🇯🇲😝🖤👑🇯🇲🔥🔥🔥
she's in competition shock... pls attend more international competitions in the future...
Sha'carri took 8 L's.  I believe this is it for her.  I don't see her coming back.
Truth is stranger than fiction. Sha'Carri showed very poor sportmanship. Did anyone notice that she did not congratulate ANY of her competitors before walking off the track. SMH. She has a long way to go.
Girl runs her mouth too damn much SMH
Did she say genuin-cy....😭😭
Man oh mannnn this is embarrassing. Delusion thy name is sha' Carri Richardson
She needs a PR person ASAP. She’s imploding
She's the Adrien Broner of sprinting
This interview explains the defeat. That's all I'm saying. She's overconfident and maybe didn't put in the effort as a result.
Shaccari will be back! this is NOT the end.
What about Men she don’t love men 👀
There's the media face and the real face. I wonder who writes those defensive and sometimes negative type tweets?
She needed that hydro
Who cares what she has to say lol like why aren’t you interviewing the winners ..who takes this much time to interview the person who came in dead last just for them to talk mess about the reactions of the people who saw the race ..calling them haters lmao like come on …you are the on who hyped yourself up and gave yourself the advantage by taking that cbd which relaxed your muscles and made you run faster and now that they took it away ..you just an average high school sprinter
She's young and talented. I hope she have the right team around her....
Say her name Lol about the woman that won you know damn well Jamaica to the f*cling world 🇯🇲
I love her she’s still a winner she will bounce back she knows what it takes
Fuck bein humble..  Just be urself and train!  Thats it!
Talking like she didn’t just finish fucking last.
She was dead last and she acts like as if she was second or third 🙆🏿‍♂️🙆🏿‍♂️
She seems to have difficulty dealing with the pressure. I hope she will be alright
I don’t agree with anything about sha’carri , I don’t like her attitude or “citygirl” mentality megan the stallion ur product is a ghetto mess ….S/O to the Jamaicans , but on the flipside the Jamaicans are going a tad bit overboard as if they dominate in any other sport ….The USA dominates , look at the medal count , and we not even gone talk about NBA , NFL , NHL , MLB or any of that , it’s levels to this.  Let the Jamaicans have their one moment we have had ours since the games begun. 💯 🇺🇸
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sad
That was not her race....but she coming back!  Watch!  Everyone has their time!
So what if she failed , so what if she came last, what they expect her to break down infront the cameras??? #keeppushing
She could have come in 5th if she cut her nails
Seriously, how does she whipe her ass?
She needs a new support system. You can tell she's just spiraling down further the more she talks.
🤣😩😩😩😂😂😂😂🤔🙄🙄🙄🤣
She's definitely a Class Act.. Never let them see you sweat. God has a plan for you Richardson..Keep your head up
I believe ShaCarri can do it...lets focus on the dream first not the world or social media your an awesome Lady...Congrats to Jamaica ladies they are awesome as well!!! Team Sha Carri💪🤑🔥🔥
People when shit doesnt go theor way: GOD HAS A PLAN
I thought she was the fastest woman in the world  why didn't she win :/
She got  💨 😂😂😂
You didn't accomplish nothing. Loser, all that noise to be last place. It is the weed
She just needs to grow
She’s a weirdo. Hope everyone can see that now.  Who runs/ sweats w/ weave, pounds of make up, fake eye lashes, raptor claws,ect?  Rhetorical
She didn't belong in that race..Shes no where in the class of the top 5 runners of that race! She should go do commercials weed or something else
Much love to Sha'Carri Richardson you did it before you can do it again , keep your head up , there are negative and positive people everywhere , do you ,focus on you .
Humble yourself baby girl. Lay off the weed too. Damn!. All that "she woulda ate at the olympics" was a reach.
She ran better on weed!
I’m pretty sure she was the ONLY ONE that didn’t go and say congratulations to the real speedsters.
Girl you are coñfuse you say that you love and walk off the field like that nobody do that
And she still hasn't learned that lesson of humility and class. Why is she getting so much coverage with her bratty self? I cant believe that she was the first to be interviewed when there were 3 remarkable ladies who led the race from 1 small island. This is crazy.
It’s cool, just grab a backwood and relax, get em next time champ lol
Get this weed head off the track she out her league
She is a train wreck, and over the next year you will see her deteriorate on live TV.
She's slow 🧠🧠
Legend has it that she lost this race coz her nails weren't long enough.
Smoked🍖
Adrian Broner is Her biggest fan. May They grow together.
She talk too much, should let her performance do the talking
talk all the smack ya smack want but getting banned n then finishing last..thats not backing it up. not sorry.
She met a different kind of speed
I’m team jamaica all day I love her competitive fire it brings excitement to the sport, I want to see her win just as much as my jamaican women
The best thing for her career was popping for weed. She wouldn’t have even been relevant in the Olympics
💓her
Like my parents used to say all the time "You win some you and you lose some".
Glad this happened to Ms Richardson on a smaller stage because she was not going to beat these young lady's from Jamaica in the Olympics. I would have hated these current actions on that stage with that type of news cycle.
She just talk too much and that's her problem,  please forgive her 🙏
Absolute embarrassment.
When you are truly running at God’s Pace, He will teach you to run with humility.  In our weakness, His strength is made perfect.  He cannot lift You up, if you are unwilling to subdue your pride, keep your tongue, and let Him be glorified in You…
Did she say back in the lab?
It just makes me to think if she really was on something to make her run like a gazelle...bc she sho' did run her race but at a normal person speed
😂😂😂😂
I love everything about her she should never apologize for being her self
A better interview than the first....
Don't know if she is still coached by Dennis but she has very poor sportsmanship  she truly has to work on that and be more humble .
Sad
Congratulations for what?????????🤣🤣🤣
I feel like she was positive and trying to be optimistic. Some of these people saying she was nervous have never been on national TV trying to be positive after they have worked so hard for something and loss.
Society vs. Strong BW  You're too loud You're too strong  You're too confident  You're too dark You're too light You're too proper You're too smart  People will love to have us as a puppet or take it back to the older days when we was seen and not heard!   My question is....would you all would have enjoyed it better if she historically cried after? I feel like the world was waiting for that I told you so moment. Again, after she lost and she congratulate the winner, what did you all want to happen next?
She’s right about having to keep believing in yourself. Imagine if she leaves saying I can never beat the Jamaicans. She would be defeated before every race. Even if it’s total bs, you have to tell yourself these things until you actually believe it. I don’t personally think she’ll beat them. They’re too fast for her.
She hurt focus baby stop talking and do what u need to do
Hey man.... It's a journey, with hard work she can be on top, but she also needs to learn how to balance  humility and her confidence. This isn't a good look just seems immature... But keep at it, learn and grow.... be better.
Where the HELL are her P.R. people!!!!
When I first saw her I thought, yes she reminds me of FloJo...but FloJo avoided any embarassing situation and got away leaving her dope marks so high that even super athletes like Elaine and Shelly cannot reach...I wish we'll not see her around any more.
I had to come hear after hearing the news. At least she still exudes positivity after the poor performances in recent times
man shut up
She's still very young and has alot to learn. Let this race be a lesson to her- not to get caught up in all the hype! She said she's planning on coming back better- so do your thing but as people have already highlighted remain respectful as well as humble. On that note 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲 to the 🌎
Baby humble. Tyson Gay is respected all over. He who seek knowledge begins with humbleness.Shacarri you talk too MUCH .
It’s ok to be disappointed with yourself and definitely never do it to prove anyone wrong. She’s talented just need some emotional guidance….
I see greatness in her, go queen can't wait to see you win again I love that positive energy you've already won.
🤔
Mouse your out
I keep thinking 🤔 she's going to poke a eyeball out
IM SO PROUD OF HER❗️
Why won’t they broadcast this interview. They wanna show when she was in a vulnerable state and use that
Say less sis....let your sprinting speak for you.
That wig had too much drag on her running. She was running like she had a parachute on
🤔🤔
NIKE pull her.. She ran last in the race and the interview was even worse!
😂😂😂😂😂 shacarri act like a little kid and run like one too goofy little girl
She is hurt and trying to uplift herself.
This must be Deontay Wilders cousin, delusional
Better luck next time, Ms. Richardson. Every day is new.  One love  🇯🇲
She’s young give her a break she done well coming from the culture and not changing her culture so I commend her keep coming I’m sure it was a honer running with champs
I now understand why athletes sometimes fake injuries in a race where the are getting smoked. It's to save them from moments like this. She got a beat down in the race had a meltdown aftetwards, and heaven alone knows what this is.
Crocodile tears lol, she too emotional.
2:25....Nothing went wrong in the race? She got smoked by the big girls.  She's got some work to do.
Don't look like a serious athlete, too flashy, too arrogant.
The amount of people in these comments praying for her downfall is pathetic. Get a life yall she’s got a way brighter future than y’all.
Some say she needs a PR team , I think she needs a Mental Health team. All is not well with her. It would be a shame if all that talent went down the drain.
This girl is defo taking the women’s world record , Shelly Ann can throw shade all she wants this girl is 21 not even in her prime watch her next season and the one that follows
I noticed her start out the blocks are not strong and straight. That makes a lot of difference when racing. All its gonna take is better technique.
She almost cry....
“I’m my biggest enemy” yeah no shit.
HUMBLE YOURSELF OR JAMAICA WILL HUMBLE YOU
Mabe be less ratchet
Defeat can often times be your biggest win. Now you've tasted how bitter it is ,now get up and get back to greatness.
U damn rite u r ur biggest enemy!! U need to go back on d tracks not the lab girl! That's why you keep losing
Keep training young one so you can reach the level of them Jamaicans phew 😮‍💨 they smoked 💨 yooooouuuu!
Imagine going to the Olympic games in full weave and nails. Young, new, or whatever they need to reel this kid in
Her confidence is there! Might not like her attitude or how she expresses it, but she’s still a baby. She has a lot of maturing/learning to do. Give her some time. 🤷🏾‍♂️I’m rooting for her.
Passion is no excuse she fully had a tantrum because she lost. She is entitled, Jamaican athletes work very hard and go through a lot more than people know, all she had to do is shut up and be humble and respectful of these ladies as they are sprint legends and I’m so disappointed to see she really didn’t learn anything from that race.
Ghetto queen. LOL
Shut up and run
Man why she winking like that, she ain’t professional lol talks too much smack and can’t take the heat ... she needs a reality check. Period lol
It’s over with for her sorry we’re counting you out
You're delusional hunny not delicious. Stop the playing. You're too cocky!
I hope you stay focused and let all this HATE people has for you and use it like the great ones do..stay away from the press and just run 🏃‍♀️ your race.
she wont become a great. jamaicans r on a next level....unstoppable
She was almost professional here, but there were moments of cockiness without completion. Leave the bs behind and concentrate on the craft,  you can’t say what you’re going to do, you have to do it.
She sounds humble in this interview. I have no problem with her tooting her own horn at all. I think it's a good thing actually. Just don't don't disrespect others in the process especially people like Fraser Pryce who are legends of the sport. Just keep it about yourself and we will cheer you on. I wish her lots of success. She is young and very talented.
I am a Jamaican🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲 she need to take al the costume off. And she will be more lighter
She probably cried after this interview!
What is “GENUINCY”
She don't carry herself like a role model
Not a good speaker needs to take notes
Takes a lot to do an interview right after losing, and knowing others want to see you crumble on camera, yet you don’t! Head strong, much respect!
Are you an athlete or a female rapper. Those nails are ridiculous you ain't nicki
Ok. She has an IQ of about 60 . But she doesn't need to be bright . She has to train and work hard  . Not smoke weed .
I thought she would come top3 but DAAAAMMMM
I have yet to see the Winner gets interviewed; Strange.
someone get her a PR team before she loses it all, so far it got worst. i hope her the best
Sha'Carri you are overrated and over hyped. If you couldn't win now what makes you think you can win later. You remember your post how you will be undefeated for the next 5 years. I ain't hearing you now. You talking about God and you still didn't learn the lesson he wanted you to learn.
She is an example of what too much Social Media does to you by taking away your focus when you have a job to do
I blame American media for gassing her up to the point where she believed it😓🤧
Man we dont need these personalities in track and field. We had Gail Devers who came out of the high school I went to. From the hood and she didnt act one bit like this. Society is going down, instead of celebrating the winner, all cameras go to this unconfident, wannabe smart, 21 year old who tries to cover up her 12 year old mentality.
gotta stop smokin' so much dope girl. Gangster girl - is she woke? because that woeness Black Lives Matter crap came back and bit every athlete...
Urgh.....next
Lovely, impressed on how she has dealt with the  outcome of finishing last  in this race after being robbed of a possible once in a life time opportunity at the 2020 Olympics. Its a big skill to keep going and hold your head up because you still believe in yourself.
Jamaicans at sprinting  Kenyans and Ethiopians at distance running  They are crushing!!! Driven by humbleness and hard hard work
Just shut the mouth and let those legs do it all.We all see thru your nervous laughs and pain behind it.The ones behind the cameras hyping you up AINT helping at all.Just stop talking and also stop focusing on social media.All those ladies you just got beat from don’t go yapping on social media.They are having fun out there and even not winning they stay having fun.Humble yourself and please stop talking.
She sound like all the birds in Philadelphia. The ones you  dudes should never marry
its good to see her back on the track, but you can't win em all. And that's okay, just gotta get better!
That fake blonde weave made her lose.  She's so full of herself she's seems so annoying. Plus she's probably high
No humility.  Check yourself before you wreck yourself, then rebuild. You lost to the best on the day.  Go JA🇯🇲
I'm done with this one.
She guna be 100m champ at some point in her career Plain and simple! Call it cocky or confidence but its Inevitable and if u cant except that then u dnt know squat about sprinting. #UrunA100M10.65Then…
Crazy how the second a black woman believes in herself and her capabilities people start tearing her down. Like what did people want her to say? That she's a terrible runner that hasn't got a future? Wow what a mood booster that would be for her. Like she says she will not benefit of dwelling about her loss, eyes forward and keep working hard to achieve her goals. Society really hates women who believe in themselves
LSU Sha'Carri owns Jamaica POV
Sis got smoked gotta love her tho 💪🏾🔥💯 hope she rebound
You come in last place and talking smack about how bad you be?  You must be high
Ok...we get it she lost! She knows what she needs to do! She was grateful enough to even step on the track with high level comp at her age! Cut her some slack for crying out loud. They intentionally put her between two experienced runners but it's cool. She is going to comeback harder and stronger. Yall need to realize we all COPE and ACCEPT things differently this is how she does it. Yeah she is hurt probably but as long as she improves, grows and trains harder she'll be back. Congrats to her. They exposed her for breaking the rules to get to her so now she may feel she has to be a certain way in the public eye idk. Her focus wasn't we can all agree on that! She didnt even want torin then race cause she knew she wasnt even at her best mentally. 9 weeks is a long time and with other personal events that took place for her and she really didnt seem at her best to begin with so I'm not gonna hold it over her head cause she only human ya'll actin like yall placed your lives into her track life😂🤣🤣
Find some respect for Jamaican Winners...a lot of black American Don't know where there from...Girl put Respect on the 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
She is getting more coverage than Elaine thompson who ran 10:54!!!a remarkable time! It's abit sad that the focus is on the looser
Thompson will control this race am not gonna lie
When you racing next time against any Jamaican don’t talk big, If you do you will lose in the biggest way you can very thing about, when you talk big around any Jamaican that’s their motivation to finish you will a disgrace
So she posted positive, it’s what it’s doesn’t matter the circumstances. So they allow her still in competition? ! This no right
She needs to relax, she puts so much pressure on herself. There is no haters, focus on yourself. She has an amazing talent, the competition is strong so no time to waste on social media.
She’s delusional af smh. Shouldn’t have shit talked before you even proved yourself
She is disturbeyby something.... She doesn't even react that she finished last after all that bragging
Y’all a weird asf and know nothing about track. She’s the fastest woman in America at only 21 and got beat by woman that are all top tier sprinters … Yall are just plain weird wanting her to lose as if she actually lost anything 😂
Go Sha!!!
I used to be fast  Until I got high Until I got high Until I got high
I see eye water ... 👀
Why is she talking so fast
This girl Will continue smoking weed
Talking too damn much…..she needs to be coachable. She needs good mentors around her.
Her reaction to her performance is great , she’s right and she knows she still needs to work hard, she still needs to step up. I’m so proud of her ✨.
Clayton twins coming to smoke you too 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
She needs HELP. She's trying so hard, girl get away. THAT girl got DUSTED and don't bring God in this. Humbleeeee yourself girl. I just hope that right time be fair, no drug use etc cus she sounds like she ready to do something desperate.
I guess the smoke is a PED.? The Jamaican ladies smoked this fool.
She needs to replace her whole staff/family and friends LOL Talk less and train more
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“I’m my own worst enemy”....no truer words have been spoken. She sounds and looks stoned. She’s young and has a lot to learn...humility, simplicity, being gracious in defeat, sports(wo)manship etc. I do hope she has the right people behind and I wish her well.
Getting her Ass kicked is just what was needed. She'll rebound, but she just had a large helping of humble pie.. She's embarrassed.  Talent alone only goes so far. Hard work,  respecting her sport and focus focus focus....
I’m rooting for this kid. I really hope that she comes back 100% because that loss is all mental. Being banned from the Tokyo Olympics is definitely in her head. It can’t be easy but she has the right mindset.
She needs to change here management 👎
Good luck Sha'Carri  Richardson, i hope you get more success in the future and be the Faster women 100M in the world  in the future
I'll say this see can out run every one that but up a negative comment!!
Lol
She is obviously trying very hard to sound more intelligent than she really is, and it is bad. And no....you dont represent me, sorry.
She reminds me of tupac when he doing interview
Just one day Shac....ur time will shine! Stay humble and keep going. Looks like the defeat will make her a superstar soon👍💪Congrats Jam amazing girls!🍻👊
that question what has this taught you .... she should have said " to be humble" .... l like you girl but please be humble...
Amen..its on God's pace
There's something special about you, infact you're special that's why you are last but still so much interviews ,the last shall be first , sweetheart train and win ,don't listen to the bad energies
Toxic world toxic girl
Burger King hiring bro.
L
This interview was hard to watch
They better  not forced this young lady out on the world stage without the proper preparation.  It will only destroy her.  I hope her trainers see that she needs help, they must polish her and set her up for success.
Tbh, I like her 👏🏾👏🏾
Humble herself? Really? You’re essentially saying “just shut up and run” . a person has the right to take the their win lose draw forfeit etc anyway they want to.
She looks like a drag queen
I was gonna go to the Olympics then I got high, I was going beat those Jamaican Super Stars, but then got high. Now making excuses and I know why.
Sha'Carri:  Im not going anywhere...moments later drops from the 200m
what an awkward fucking interview
she needs to focus on her running and not the marketing side. There’s confidence and then there’s arrogance and you miss are arrogant!!!
She hides her pain really well… she even knows how to laugh it off… signs of a narcissist
She's holding back tears.
Shacarry is black version of Elsa jean
She talks too much,  do the work and be quiet
You are the last fastest woman alive!😂 Humble yourself now.
The nervous laugh tells it all. She definitely cried after the race.
She ain't no warrior. She's annoying and comes off full of herself. Hopefully now we can stop talking about her and give Thompson-Herah her props
Damn Last?!? I was shocked to see this shit happen. But yeah she should shut up and just give props to everyone who beat her.
You the future gal. Just lay off the blunt and you’ll be aaaight. Welcome back
You not a role model! Role models show you how you suppose to act, not act the way you want.
She needs a better team around her. She can be real when she speaks to the media...but she has to be professional.  She's apologizing too much for her behavior.  Then it doesn't become an apology...it becomes apolog-lying. She hS some growing up to do...but she can do it. Kobe had this type of mentality at the beginning of his career and what changed him was the incident he had that almost ruined his career.  But he Learned from his mistake and he changed.  This embarrassing race should humble her, but according to her post interview...she has some growing up to do. Mamba Mentality!
She have mouth alone
Girl got smoked.
If trying your best to remain positive after taking a huge L was a  person!
She’s still a mf BEAST, every dog has its day as they say…and as she said, y’all are still gonna watch
Just gorgeous! Inside and out!
You fine momma just keep working!!
Sha'carri is still very young, should chill smoke a blunt and regroup her self
Be humble. Soon after the race she came across a foul loser not congratulating anyone and walking off. And the way she’s presenting herself here is off putting. Hope she gets herself together ,excel and Get a MEDIA COACH because this whole presentation is not working.
She is so precious! Its all about Shacarri!
She may need more blood,sweat,and tears
Did her fingernails slow her down?
You’re done ! Smh too much arrogance!!
I feel sorry for her. She needs help she just said “I am my biggest enemy.”
the delusional of this girl. go sit  down and be humble.
She need to work on her attitude and humble herself.
Man she’s lying to her self. You know you don’t feel “delicious” after a terrible performance like that😐
*She needs therapy & a mentor* #BeHumble
You are great!
This is whom we should have seen in the post race interview this was so much better and the kind of person that’s easier to root for 🤷🏾‍♂️👍🏾
Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less.
But you came in dead last homegirl smh not 1 not 2 not 3 not 4th not 5th not 6th not 7th not 8th but dead ass last 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Someone need to wheel her bck in..real talk🇯🇲
Blonde hair hyena don't care
This chick is ready to the hood olympics....She got the nails and the wig oohhh she ready!
Wow, God showed the world what your about. Stop being boastful and pray. The race proves to the world that naturally your not as  fast and you was doping. She will one day win as long as no 🇯🇲 are in the race.
I love her…all this talk about her being humble is white supremacy garbage
Imagine thinking you sacrificed for something you were disqualified from for breaking the rules…. Over weed
She is ok leave her thats just her personality
Blah blah blah to all the weirdos who switched up on her. I still love and support you ShaCarri! It be your own people, quick to turn on you for absolutely nothing and anything. Y’all was gassing her up and supporting tf outta her not too long ago but as  soon as she does it to herself, it’s a problem. You win some, you lose some. It’s not that deep.
last place??? all that hype for nothing h
Sha Carri...This is one race i ain't going nowhere.. .....withdraws from the 200 meter....girl bye..
She high 👏🏾😂
She sucks. As a runner and as a person.
Arrogance is a sin..she just a lost sheep period! she needs proper direction..thank God she acknowledged shiz her own enemy..speaking complete nonsense after coming out last..typical American lost lad.
Maybe not having those long ass nails might help her run faster
I love her
She keeps saying "perform". That shows where her head and heart are. She wants to be seen and put on a show rather than be disciplined and race well.
Needs a good new coach today!!!
She is extremely immature.... I didn't think she would get 9th place but I didn't think she would beat Thompson either.... Those girls are in a different league mentally and physically.... This is a big lost and historic one... and she earned it....
Let's be honest Sha'Carri was the headliner the hype machine okay why we all was intrigued.Habing said that I must say May Allah blessed this child.Her talent there.But she clearly needs a better team around her.
💀😭💀 she sound like a 14 year old
Where’s the cockiness everyone is talking about? I just see a confident determined athlete. She didn’t disrespect anyone.
"I love women"
This child need to humble, she is not a runner
Smh.
Less talk and more work
Hate jamaican the woman  they got a name poor loser
less talk more action, period
Glad she apologised for that previous interview 🙏 and this one was much better and alright  👌
So funny when she got beat she said that she  didn't expect anyone  🤣
She seems really nervous, fake confidence
I loved her response honestly, just hate the nervous laugh
Stay humble, try not to act like a clown!! Hope she'll sort that mess up!!Best of luck
I think the chick got a sad case of Nikki Minaj, Cardi B, City girls and the rest of these women that act like crazy as hell!!!
What a poser
Imagine making the Olympics and didnt make it. She didnt gaf about this race.
That's my baby
Hey gal a last u come u should a shame stuck up like
You need to shut the hell up and work!  You don't deserve all the attention you've been getting!
May God protect this innocent , ambitious, and PURE soul.
She needs to talk like this, she knows some tiktok junky will add some inspiring music and make it sound like words of wisdom kind of thing in tiktok. 😂😂
she will come back stronger and more focused..
She sounds great now.💯
I feel like vomiting looking at her nails
She will be okay. 💯👍👍👍!
Trying so hard to root for this kid but this interview was so cringeworthy🥴 she needs to say less and know the difference between confidence and arrogance
y'all some haters
She getting more unsubs, than fresh&fit
Nips pierced     -I’m sorry that was creepish
Just. Stop. Talking.
She’s so fake, F off shacarri
I think the weed got her paranoid who’s counting her out ???? That’s what she said. Also right after the race the people are talking shit what people the race just finished when you started talking shit ..
Sha’Carri still needs to humble herself. You’re not “that girl yet” I wish her well and really hope she learns from this experience. Get focused and train harder and let your feet do the talking. Bless up to Team JA 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
1:33😉🤣  I genuinely think having all that hair out must have slowed her down
she got cooked, deep fried, boiled,steamed, aircooled, ect. stay humble.
God bless you Sha'Carri
shes not built like those jamaican girls, they got huge asses they get that power fron
Damn she immature. No wonder she decided to smoke weed instead of competing she needed an excuse for that ass woman from the Jamaicans.
Clearly she was on something.... She sounded like I used to after I Messed up....... Either that or she's about to have a Break Down......... That Laugh and Smile was Fake as Donald J.Trump when he was in office
She needs to sit down with your fellow sportwomen and learn a lesson or two on humility. She has great potential but her mouth runs faster than her legs.
Those nails, weave, and that attitude are slowing you down
I love her and ready to see her win again
This is how it should have been after the race
When the interviewer ask what this has taught you, your answer should be “ to be humble “. I can see how distraught you are right now. 🇯🇲don’t come for us because we didn’t send for you🇯🇲
I hope she comes back. One thing about her is that she does not make excuses. That is a good trait.
90% of these comments are trash. Utter judgemental bullshit. Preaching humility from the highest self appointed position of insight. Ya'll need the PR team. You really talk about people like this to their face? Humans should be better. Be better. Or just watch the video and move on with your rotten, demeaning, better than thou art, comments
She's a child 4 christ sake & yall talkin crazy like yall ranked n sumthing or have a few medals..gtfoh!!
No she didn't have on them Long Ass Daisy Duck Cartoon Character eyelashes..... While she was Running a Race!!
It’s her fake laughing every 2 seconds for me 😂😩😩😩
A lot of pressure for a young girl and she doing her best! Most the people talking about her are sitting on the couch typing 🤫
I mean haters can talk. You did get last lmao
Humiliation ritual that's why she got last in race. The symbolism is everywhere if you have eyes. She'll be back stronger than ever watch. Everything seems like it was planned out even the weed thing, i knew her arse was coming back lol but she'll be on top. They like to bring down a rising star hard, just to bring them up. Or she'll cross over Into acting. And or both. We've all seen this before with the rising stars media and sports. Like an initiation ritual. But I adore her either way
I need  a blunt
#TRUTH THEY CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE EVERYTIME. For Me Too
#Revolution  #Legacy

Sounds like a bunch of talking points.
#GloryToGod I AM METTAYO JAMES ALI WOMACK
It’s almost like she’s rehearsing affirmations. She tries to show that she’s confident but may not feel confident. In other words, she needs to do less talking and do more working.
I mean come on.....she running her mouth more than she ran the race. She needs to stay off social media, focus on running, get some serious  *MEDIA*  *TRAINING*   and learning a little bit about humility would help. Don't know if the folks around her are really helping her at all. She may need to change the team and folks who surround.
Clearly her agent got a hold of her and told her to apologize for her classless interview after the race because sponsors don't like giving money to people that curse and act like that after losing a race. She needs to mature and show more class.
I LOVE YOU. ❤️‍🔥😌❤️‍🔥✅
What is wrong with what she’s saying? She’s being very nice and positive. Would we be more happy if she was crying ? Not to mention she has a beautiful face.
Dead last. And Richardson’s comments after a poor performance was embarrassing.
Ummm I’m not a math major but her best time 10.72 is nowhere close to elaine hera 10.54 time she just posted. I’m not sure how you can make up that much time unless you train with the flash or superman
I love her ! I hope she continues to train and her future is so bright
Too much words and talking for being last of the race !!!
Well done to the Jamaican ladies and Sha'carri.....🎉🥂🥳🎉🥂
Y’all are really taking what she say wrong! She is doing really good! A lot of athletes get in front of the camera and say the wrong stuff! She handle her interviews very well!!! ❤️❤️❤️
why she talking too full of herself only? she could've talk about how great Elaine was.
What a load....
I love that she said she came there not expecting anything...meaning she did NOT expect to win....the second thing that stood out to me was her saying that she loves seeing WOMEN, regardless of the flag they represent, win! I wish people would leave her alone!
I love women, I love successful women. Why these Americans women only care women? We they don't care about the whole nation? If only they can see how women have it in Afghanistan, Haiti, Iran some Africans coutries, They will think twice before they open their mouth to complain.
Dont forget you a smoker too lol
Classy, even in defeat.
When Elaine Thompson-Herah laid on the track after winning the Olympic 100M, I thought nothing could look cheaper than her inner-thigh tattoos. I wondered if the tattoos had things like I've read on stall walls and above urinals in funky restrooms. But there's something with less class than inner-thigh tattoos: Sha'carri Richardson. All of Richardson's affectations (the nails, the blonde extensions, her attitude) are pathetic attempts to divert attention from her empty brain. There's no there there. I'll savor this humiliating defeat for years.
She is very SURE of herself~  I hope she develops some GRACE as she ages and matures❤
JESUS LOVE YOU
You lost it’s ok
NBC damn sure helped in the hyping up. That was two sistas that came in last today that NBC made to look like droids that never lose.
This is not being cocky everybody shut the fuck up she is raw and she the best so losers always win at the end she like that this how you always have to be in the end to win
She got served some ice cold humble juice. I was rooting for her! That little laugh isn’t so innocent. Attitude is a big too much. These Jamaicans didn’t bring it upon themselves to brag about winning. All they did was DO IT. Big ups Jamaica!! 🇯🇲 ❤️💛💚
Her hands were shaking 😔 you can definitely tell she was nervous.
She does to much talking. Just say, “There’s always a next time.” Wave and keep it moving.
She’s not even making sense when she talks. She needs a PR team. How do you have haters when you finished in last place🤨
She has the emotional intelligence of a 12 year old girl.
Keep yo head  up  u still a champion 💯
What in the actual hell? She needs media coaching desperately.
I understand all the negative and positive reactions, but I really was focusing on the fact she got she got her nipples pierced!!!
She was getting ready for this race while the others where at the Olympics 😂 she looks like the missing group member of migos lol 😂 quavos twin 😂
How do you wipe your butt after the toilet with those nails ?
We gotta remember this is a kid. And her generation doesn't live in reality. They believe they are legendary just for showing up. She was out of her league. She's totally delusional in this video
clearly she has stop taking her performance drugs and disguising it as weed
Ohhh"today was an L"tho ma'am😒#BlackGirlUnphasedFakeMagic
Did she say genuinecy ??
Blah blah blah blah blah
She cannot speak at all somebody please send her to someone speaking classes
3:10 that guy said "Congratulations" like he didn't see her come in last place 😂
Her eyes are anime huge. I mean it looks beautiful anime. Hope she stays this nice and cool and amicable.
She is the female version of Dez Bryant
She aint sheeet w/o the weed and PEDs🪴💉… BUH BYE
I get “being the boss, even in a loss”. I totally get that. Even if your the bad guy, the one always talking brashly and boldly, the one who goes against the grain, that’s fine if you win. Winning is important. You can talk all you want, you can be confident all you want, but when you lose it makes it worse. It’s supposed to be that way. You should only talk the talk if you can back it up. You can’t just talk. You can’t just be confident. You just can’t always have a reason for everything, a reason why you lost, a reason why you cursed, a reason for this and a reason for that. At some point we all have to delivery, especially if we talk a big game. The lesson is: when you talk and don’t perform, or are ostentatious and come up short, it’s a terrible feeling it’s embarrassing. That’s why we applaud Kawhi Leonard who goes and gives you 40 points and never says a word. That’s why we love Marshawn Lynch and Marvin Harrison and Andre Johnson and Tim Duncan, famous for never talking to the media or Opponents about how good they were or what they were going to do, they just went out and dominated. If you can talk trash and be one of the greats we’ll all love you, because you talked a big game and backed it up, that’s gangsta, it’s gangsta because you run the risk of making a fool outta yo self. That’s it. There’s no other perspective. This the first time ever, after consecutive Ls, that an athlete or anyone was brash and Defiant and dare I say arrogant in the face of defeat and humiliation. It’s not how life works. it’s indefensible, dishonorable, immature, and unmanly.
Who Should She Humble To?
Are u sure you didn't  smoke last night? They should be send u to test.
Keep running and push through this. She will be fine. Just a disappointing day
I can tell she smokes😂
I just love this young lady ! Well done ! Continue to Keep your head up !
Ole boy is hella cocky and he got smoked.
You're not a role model your attitude  said a lot about your character, you need to work on your sportsmanship.
Your performance today don't make any sense, . How can some one went from qualifying for the olympics with fast times, didnt run in the olympics ample time to train, get good rest and get ready.  Now these ladies hve been running heats t like thoroughbreds at the kentucky durby its better you had tell your coach you not ready had a month to train and  dead last was your hype?!
hahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
This is a baby going after her dreams and did the work to get here… This world of grown immature, non-motivated, lackluster humans will demonize anyone secure in their purpose and anointing in humanity!  Keep going young Queen… You are a trailblazer! 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
You can hear the nervousness in her voice. She’s gonna cry in the car
She’s as fake as her nails, hair, lashes etc…
If that was passion….I’ll pass..and the not the blunt..😂😂😂
Overrated
If what she has is confidence. Then confidence is overrated.
She  probably was nervous around the Jamaicans
She did great lose some win some  solute to all the black women nobody took a lose
Talking like she won the race... but came in dead last.  It's like the Twilight Zone.
I DON'T enjoy "THE MEDIA" asking  too many questions.
She took the L. She’s confident. It’s a sport. You can be humble and still be competitive. You talk shit in ya sport. Come back and buss ass. Back to the Lab
Way Too Geaux,  baaaabbbby your doing what you love,  win or lose do ya thing, people understand this lady is talented, and whether you lose u still win. She may have lost, but No one is talking about the winner, you its still a win for all the negative comments.  By the way nice run by the Jamaicans
Richardson got her ass handed to her.
If any black person thinks that this woman is a "queen" then please reevaluate your priorities. While you are doing that search up the words queen and king.
At least she's a lot more reasonable and articulate here than immediately after the race.  But she needs to get it together.  She said it best herself: "I am my biggest enemy."  I'm glad to hear her acknowledge it, because it's about as obvious as "water is wet."
Came in last place because she was too high to run.
She speaks so well. Very charismatic. I love her ❤️ & know she will bounce back 💯💪🏽
She’s so embarrassed… poor thing smh
You’re that girl???? You’re that girl that got her arrogant ass smoked
I sure hope her trainers are watching these interviews. From an experience standpoint this appears to be a cry for help. Something is going on, and it needs to be addressed...swiftly. You talked out of turn, and the Olympic Champions hopefully HUMBLED you...they are way out of your league and you need to STAY OFF of social media...train, train, and train some more. You aren't ready to go against the absolute BEST in the world...your lack of experience, heart, and maturity was exposed today...take notes and adjust accordingly. So many people thought you were punished too severely...if you weren't ready today, you definitely wouldn't have been ready for Tokyo...I wonder what the loud mouths are saying now....nothing...*crickets*
The andrelaine is still pumping through her, she needs someone near her. She is going to go into shock. I don't think she realizes how terrible she did.
She needs to tested, even with a 9th place finish 🙄
*Comments filled with how she needs to be "hUmBlEd". Like can y'all shut up?? She's 21. She's still young as hell. She'll get there to being the best.*
ouch...that was uncomfortable to watch. ....uncomforcy?....come on Jesse, u know that's not a word 🤣
Young people are stupid. - Salvador Dali
Some people talking about media coaching,ok.Indont totally disagree and I’m not a huge fan of everything that happened with this but over the last few months people complain when they don’t talk and then they do talk and that’s not good enough.The swearing in the other interview(Yeah That was bad)She gets coached up how to speak to well and people will say she is being fake or P.C..You can’t win
She got the "Ronda Rousey" treatment from the Jamaican sprinters!!! Stop chat and try fi run faster...🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲💯💯💯
No disrespect but I feel her confidence is forced . How you go from being first place to being Iast place ? Was she only on weed or was she on something a lil more
Did that guy passing in the back said Congratulations??Lol that sounded like shade.
I was hoping she would win today but she didn’t. I was hoping she would be humble in defeat but she wasn’t. I do believe she can comeback but it may be a bit and the competition has gotten stronger.
She got too caught up in the politics and forgot to train lmao! This is a lesson to keep your eyes on the prize and don’t get caught up in the liberal nonsense.
ShaCarri,  You're a warrior for even running in that heat! Now you know where you stand; Keep training and you will be fine! Don't listen to the negativity; YOU ROCK! Remember some people didn't even make it to the race! Keep your head up sweetheart 💓
Bullshit!!! You have to earn the title of "Queen" some of yall throw that term around  too loosely. A queen is Athing Mu, a queen is McLaughlin. She is a black women with blonde hair. If that's not self hate, I don't know what self hate is.
She’s competitive you soft ass people wouldn’t know nothing about that
Congratulate the winners and move on.
Its the weed....she lost and words can produce a win!  She smoked millions away... you have to have the full package.. yoy have to a nental and physical focys.. the greats bever had to explain. They just produced! She will not win because she wants the dame and miney and sge hasnt oricen anything! She will continue to lose.. her support group is to wide and full of yes people... nobidy hates you but your creating a negative  vibe..its win then you vollect.. your losing and will be out
Girl is laughing and nervous asf lmaoooo
RATCHET
She seems high AF 😂😂
Fraser pryce face was priceless..Dammmm
She needs to lay off the weed. Lmao. She needs to put more work in her legs rather than her eyes. She's in the wrong contest. Beauty queen trials are in the other side of town.   She will never beat the Jamaican girls again.   I think she's on drugs in this interview.
Maybe if she cut the hair and lost the nipple piercing she could shave 1 second off and get 5th place. Possibly even be a role model for the next generation.
Everybody isn’t the same .. Some of us don’t have people routing for us at home so we have to be our own hype man... She can humble herself when she retires right now she needs to focus and get to her A game .. Whatever that is for her
I understand people had a problem with the way she handled the post race interview, but gotdamn people, this chick is only 21 years old. There's only so much maturity you're gonna get out of a damn 2000's baby in 2021.
Seen it coming ! Zoom 🇯🇲 she definitely need a mentor
She know now deep down inside she is embarrassed, bc she called them all out!!!! Humble yourself!
She’s a amazing athlete and wish her the best.
If American track and field and nike really care about this little girl...please help her...
Sha'carri Richardson You really need to grow up.
You need to humble your personally makes you look crazy you talk to much bare fart
She talk to much. Love her tho. Jamaica to da worl
The entire track rolled Sha'Carri in a Grape Swisher. 🍇💨 Kids Don't Do Drugs! 🚫
She reminds me of a kid who says what she thinks they want them hear.
Itzova.
..........these laughs of hers.
Sorry but the jokes on you. She still hasn’t learnt
Dis lickle pickney needs help....somebody please reach out to her before she hurts herself
I take great pride in knowing that I would have came in the place as ShaCari if I ran for her. Congratulate me.
Humble or not she can’t compete the Jamaican girls
Just get better with time
When you don’t take that illegal stuff.. it’s kinda hard to run. What a loser. Warriors don’t lose 🤷🏻‍♂️
Ppl love an underdog and that's what Sha'carri is bt, how long will u  love an underdog for when you they don't prove themselves
"I feel delicious...ok" Sha'carri to the world! That's our girl and we gone stand by her 😁🙌🏾
Americans are always under more pressure than athletes from other countries. No way she was gonna beat Fraser pryce and  thomoson. But people were kinda expecting her to beat them. Come on!
Rip bozo
She so fake just like that hair she wearing
She high asf..  I feel delicious 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It was definitely an L.   Keep working girl, those girls are Fast as hell
She frass
this kid is awful. who raised this?
My grandpa always told me to be humble
Too much masculine energy.
She really needs to pull her shit together. The flash is too over the top now and someone needs to ground her. She can do great things, though right now she’s confused. Last place isn’t acceptable considering her time June.
Look at that adams apple 🍎see right thru this one
What coach in their right mind would allow this young girl who is probably a phenom athlete to compete with the hair and nails she was wearing. She looked like a Christmas tree.. Hair, nails, crystals in eyes, eye lashes, pierced nipples… all of it … it’s like she is more concerned with her image than her craft. This video is cringeworthy, you can tell that she in broken emotionally.
Booooo.
shell learn from this and will be fine.
What this race showed is just how far she still has to go. She was blown away. End of story. In this interview she's very clearly trying desperately to hide her embarrassment with big talk, and it's really not working. You can't be all mouth prior to an event, then finish last like that when the pressure's on. You can't use her age against her either as many Sprinters before her have stepped up when younger than she is now. She has to show humility(real humility) and know she's been outclassed by better Sprinters. She now has to go away and work on her game. She needs to work hard on her start. Perhaps if she can burst out the blocks and be ahead of these guys after the first 15-20 then her transition into top end speed could prove vital. As she is now though, she'll continue to be blown away.
Those nails and lashes slowed her down. Lose them!
Not 1st, 2nd, 3rd,  4th, but last. Talking about how she was coming for the Jamaicans. She really needs to talk less and act more. Well done Jamaica.
Nice piercings tho. I see you
Nike told her to calm down on her interviews or she's going to be sponsored by Shaq shoe line.
I don't blame u girl I blame the American people, they hyped u up and cared not to support the other American ladies in the race. Smh🤦🏼‍♀️. U need a whole lot of humble and a little bit or pr training
I like this girl win or lose. She my alter ego. Don’t care what nobody think.  Keep doing you boo.  Be courageous.  It’s so many ppl who wish they could develop that much confidence in the face of being hyping yourself and then fail.  Wow!  Practice and come back harder.   Shake it up win or lose. I’m sort of glad she has this attitude because the world will tear you down for just loving on you.  Go For it!  PERIOD. 👍🏿🤷🏿‍♂️🙏🏿👑
That wig an nail need to go it’s giving ghetto 😂😂
Take that damn dead wig off your head.
Her track shoes just went from Nike outlet to Ross and Burlington coat factory 😂
Give this young lady a break. We all have made mistakes and will make more. She owe non of us nothing but herself. She lost the race so what. How is that hurting your life. I wish her the best going forward.
She's ghetto
She needs a PR Team ASAP
It’s funny seeing all these Americans turn they back on her lol. Y’all just ride waves.
Hmmmm... Maybe good idea to stay off the dope?  Looks like maybe you haven't.
It was an L.
Lol a warrior..your a fuckin runner
Damm I hate to see her winning she’s really gonna talk so much shit! She finished 9 and was talking a bunch of bull shit!
Lawd help her lol
Humility is key.... humble yourself. Jamaican sprinters demonstrated true sportsmanship.
Then damn nails
She tried hard not to cry
She’s the female mayweather lol but he just never lost
This girl is crazy. She acts like she's already got an amazing career or something  she's conpletelly delusional.
This interview is completely incoherent.
She attended school/ college but didn't accept the education.   Representation is the word . Not representce . Only American can fail upwards this is spectacular is she related to Trump fuck up fail to preform and gain popularity
🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Look crazy with all that hair and eye lashes
What “God” is she referring to? She keeps bringing up God then cursing up a storm acting crazy, I’m confused
You were the biggest hater for the Jamaicans you should have remained humbled and you wouldn't have been ridicule that way
Nice piercing b...but please stop talking...just nod or sum 🤔😆
I would assume not too many official men on her team... First, rid the weed, than the weave... than channel her energy into running faster and you’ve  got yourself a record breaker.
The passion she has is smoking...no dedication, no work ethic...u would think getting cut from the olympics would of motivated her...n she finished dead last...
Was it just me but in all of her interviews she sounds like a fast talking drug fiend!!!!! She is quite unlikeable. However in the USA, it seems that you do not need to win just talk about how you could win.
She won't last long in this sport. She isn't humble. She's even laughing after finishing last. Losing like that is supposed to hurt, and add fuel to her fire, but apparently it doesn't. She doesn't seem disappointed. Embarrassed? Definitely embarrassed.
Heat of passion
She aint got no sportsmanship
😂🤣🤣 I’m not sure if she’s very confident or cocky.She’s talented but needs to act as how she speaks. She needs to act grounded.Forget all the hype on you and focus on your passion, she has not accomplished anything major in the sport as yet so just be a bit calm.🤣She’s great marketing for the sport though.She might not be at Usain’s level as yet but she can get there as long as she stays grounded and puts in the performances like Elaine and Fraser-Pryce have done for many years.
I blame the big ass wig lashes nails and a nipple ring. It slowed you down sis Period 😆 🤣 😂
Did she say “genuinecy” ? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The nails, the hair, no etiquette, she's a lost cause
Lmfao, ALLLLLLLL that talk and yet ran dead last 😂🤦🏽‍♂️ she keep laughing cause she knows she’s a joke.
From what we saw time to go back to the drawing board Richardson. That ban got to you the next 4 years is plenty of time for improvement. Because the Jamaicans are king in the sprinting world.
She spoke well 👏🏽👏🏽🇯🇲 #Hindsight
Omg I hope she get the help she need
Them long ass nails probably slowed her down
When I ran i never thought about a day of having fans .. sports are a big joke now days
You got smoked, no pun intended!
Weave make up nails jewelry and the wrong attitude will slow you down....
You are AN athlete. Is she in school?
……girl NICKI BOUT TO FLAME 🔥 YOU
She should sit at Elaine Thompson-Herah's feet and get nuggets of wisdom. I like that she is trying not to let this crush her. Humility (once she gets it) is what will transform her.
Sha'carri said the Olympics wouldn't be the same without her...and she asked if we missed her after Elaine Thompson won the 100m in tokyo....well, after her prefontaine classic performance I'm thinking she should have stayed home again...trash talk gets you no where especially when you can't back up your sh*t...
Well said. Even if we don't like her. She said what she said. And damn was it well said. U go girl
She just has to focus on her training.  Just accept the defeat lol
She didn't lose the race she lost the interview.... humility is Gold.
she don’t realize running to jamaican people and my self as a jamaican isn’t just a sport it’s a type of thing every jamaican dreams about she can go work anywhere but to a jamaican this means the whole world you run good or don’t run at all .
Too much weed and fake hair creating coefficient drag, and not enough discipline to avoid self distructive temptations or maintain her training.  A role model? What a joke! That's laughable considering how she disqualified herself from a once in a lifetime opportunity just to smoke weed.  She's not a role model, but rather a CAUTIONARY TALE on what NOT to do.
Typical of her kind.  Can’t wait to see where she’ll be five years from now. Note: that’s actually two years after the next Olympics in Paris.
She don’t need to be humble god gave her a talent y’all want her to be humble because y’all ain’t in her position and don’t like her having a proud look with her talents
Oh Im counting you out 🤣 why are we heaping praise on a TALENT that hasn't won a dam thing!!!!! My Lord America can we ask this young lady to perform before we make her famous.
If she did ever win... Lol but not today shakaberry
She's gonna cry in the car
She needs to grow up
Two words: MEDIA COACH.... The nervous laugh is killing me..
Can y’all please sit down? Y’all still ain’t running faster than sha’carri even tho she in dead last. Y’all are outclassed period.
She needs some good people in her corner giving her some good advice because she is seriously hurting herself, her brand and her future.. Sadly, she'll be another " Could've been"  working at Walmart in about 5 years....
Roll the credits because it's over for Sha'Carri..... Elaine Thompson 10.54 WL 100m
People mad at her confidence  but it was  okay for kobe though ?
Man stop making excuses for her....Mouth Almighty Got what she deserved....She chat too much....She took that bent over all the way up, her spine got shifted 😂😂😂😂
Somebody please don't let her go in the lab. Sha carri darling ur young, you have the rest of your life to shine. Be patient and show some respect for seniority
What this situation has taught you...? It taught you to humble yah backside....last place..yuh sound vex!
I see the STREETS! in her
Seems like she’s mind controled
This wasn't a good interview 😬. Didn't mention team USA didn't take accountability
Girl next Olympics we have Elaine, Jackson, Brianna,  Clayton; so u better work hard and stop talking
Hopefully between Sydney McLaughlin, Gabby Thomas, Jenna Prandini, Abby Steiner, Javianne Oliver and Teahna Daniels she can get pushed out of the USA team, she just make sme cringe.
All the people commenting definitely remember u most likely typed in her name to come watch this video, she still winnin … b safe tho
Ikyfl
Really immature, reminds me of Adrian broner the female version. I think it’s good she got smoked show her some humility. Hopefully in 4 years she grows up.
I feel she was on performance enhancement.  I'm sorry but she is so corny to me period
Loseerrrrrrrrrrr
I use to run. When you lose you don't make excuses. If you are hurt or not ready you should not run. On any given day, the best man or woman wins. If I had better competition I would highlight how good the competition was. Focus on the positives and just get ready for the next race. Although I was always confident...I was humble. I just got on the track and ran. I let my performances and times speak for me. She needs to realize that 1 race and a few good times do not make a champion. She models herself after a runner that many believe was a cheater. Go look at the real American champions ( Wilma Rudolph, Evelyn Ashford, etc.) One or 2 good times do not make you a champion. Go watch Ashford walk down the Russians and Germans from 20 meters behind in the 4x100. Go learn what a true female track champion is.
"Genuinecy" is a word now?💀🤦🏿‍♂️
Humble yourself, she keeps going this way, she'll be in trouble OF is coming to and end in October.
I’m seeing a lot of cover up  She still being cocky after taking a huge L
This interview is much better Sha'carri, was really turned-off by the one immediately after the race. Your competitors are more than worthy opponents, treat them like that on and off the track.
She's gonna have to juice like hell to catch the back-a-yahd gyaldem.
She already killed herself with that damn Weed that will never go AWAY from her
Awful interview. Its like shes a rapping track star. Bad for interviews, sore loser, quitter (withdrew from the 200), and she represents America?? Naw brah! Its 1000+ women that look much better, act much better in front and behind the cameras,, and can perform much better than her. Most athletes that lose their mom will take that heartbraking energy and turn that into fuel and got ham on everybody. I feel sorry for what shes been thru but she should stay home. This aint for her
Shut up mann.. lol
What this should teach you is to humble yourself and accept defeat gracefully. She’s worst than Carl Lewis when he loses
I know I’m commenting a lot but this is triggering. What’s the pretentious laugh about. What’s funny
Girl friend you came last..Meaning, You're not up to d time mann..You're not on that level so stop the yapping mann..Kmt, Yap yap yap
Ego is a mf
Attitude sucks!
Someone ask her what it feels like to place 9th and how that happened. Like how do you lose by that much after having a long layoff and all that time to train.
If she improves the economics of her running stride and load-up off the blocks she will be hard to beat.  She's got natural speed but her technique still needs some work.  She needs to increase the length of her stride as she has too many foot strikes per meter (lunges in the weight room and ladder work will help to improve that).  She also rocks her upper-torso side-to-side too much which is a waste of energy and doesn't add anything in terms of speed, if you look at the Jamaicans they have an extremely strong core and they rarely move anything but their arms in a linear fashion (ETH is almost flawless in her stride mechanics and SAFP is a "rocket" out of the blocks).  NOTE: I noticed that she stumbled a bit at about the 40-meter mark.  I haven't seen or heard that she hits the weights but I know that SAFP does nearly 300-pound squats (I've seen videos where she is moving three 45-plates on each side with ease).  She also plants her feet too low on the blocks which means she has to waste time raising her feet in order clear the track at the start of the race.  Due to her size, she needs to mimic SAFP's out-of-the-block technique.  She needs an elite coaching team to change those bad habits and to work on that form.  Good luck to her...I still love the swagger though!
Give her a break....she's still very young...a teenager with much success... humbleness comes with wisdom...wisdom come with experience...experience comes with time...how many of you peoples kids  still doing dumb shit at 19 years old with at least a GRAIN of her success? What your kids doing right now? Not running on TV I BET! and what are YOU doing? Not running a 100m dash in under 11 seconds even on your BEST IN SHAPE DAY OF YOUR LIFE.
Is genuincy a word…?
Gives 50 excuses *  “But that’s not an excuse”
I was so turned off by how they hyped this race up.  There was no way that Ms. Richardson was going to beat Elaine, Shelly-Ann and Shericka. Her best time this season wasn't close to theirs.   But there is hope. Time is on her side and I wish her the best. Life will be her teacher.
Product of her upbringing and circumstances. She will grow up and develop. You mortals are so quick to judge smh.
You’re not “that girl” and you never will be…take a back seat in last place chump
Drugs are bad.
That wasn't a set back if the other female set a world record, that's not her competitive thats call cussing cause she know she got smoke, she may have wanted to win she wasn't running to set a world record.
Something isn't right. She's trying so hard and seems inauthentic .
Humble pie
She is everything that foreign people of color hate about us ; they think we all bud smoking sht talkers
Hi young lady ...I will give to you a good advice please go and learn something from the American queen of track in my opinion Alixson Felix ,i believe she can help you..
some people just suck
Immature.  She was correct that she is her own enemy.  If she wakes up she will be a force to be reckoned with but until then she needs to sit down.......be humble
You got smoked 🤫
Her career is over. She knows damn well she crying inside
Every body have bad days she's only 21years old and is and always been and still gonna be something special. Keep head up sister bcuz one race won't define a long career got got a head of yourself. Love you Shacarri and all my beautiful Jamaican sister also
Arrogant fool🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Theres a fine line between " Proving to others" and "doing it for yourself". Stop worrying about social media and everyone else
Mi Jamaican dad 🇯🇲an Guyanese mada🇬🇾 did saying shi needs fi be humble cuz it neva luk gud an mi country Jamaica did dat 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲 Jamaica tuh di world 🇯🇲🇯🇲#tallawah🙌🏾✨
TEAM Sha'Carri Richardson 💯
WOW! She sounds ignorant as hell.
She wasn't prepared for this race, she didnt even looked like she was trying and she sound salty. Prayers up u got this, come back strong
shacari deffo has a warrior heart, I was pissed at how she handled and talked to her team during the olympic, but she has passion
Some run a race, others run their mouth.
Was she not able to practice?
Y'all couch potatoes sit back and study every little detail about ppls and try to figure out all the negativity you can about them. It's so sad. Known of these comments amaze me. Smh. ..Keep your head up sister don't read into the hater's bcuz of one race I  see all of them beautiful black sister lose on the track bcuz it's a sport and that happens.
Run your race and not your mouth. You sound as ridiculous as you look. With that said she is undoubtedly a great talent....just focus and grow up, and you'll be fine.
Whoever is her P.R team they really should be fired. Neeeeeow!
She has that "I'ma get em one day" attitude and everybody knows she is good for it. Keep burning young Sha'kari, we love you 🙂
Congratulations on your return...!  Just remember you had the opportunity, to be in the company of the best.  That in itself, is an honor.  Keep going forward with your talent..., to be one of the best "World-Class Sprinters," and one of the best "Pro Track Athletes," you can be...!
She finished last 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kobe said: be better.be greater. be stronger. Do more.  Love this kid hope she keeps fighting.
Nails, weave and eyelashes slowed her down. Also, bloated ego works like a parachute which is NOT good for sprinting. Who's in her circle? Smh.
She is high...
I love her but “The GENUINCY” 😩😣babygirl let’s work on getting a PR team together with the quickness.
If she was a rapper she would be coi Leray laughter of embarrassment just shut up congratulate the winners no long speech that’s for winners .....this generation not strong enough to handle defeat she already fucked mentally she’s focus on  hood image more than what put her on she’s fake dying inside it’s clear to see laughter of pain
She's a young girl who CLEARLY needs to mature. Wishing her the best.
She couldn't believe she lost that big. Lmaoo she thought it was a walk thru lol 😆 😂 💀 these girls been beating   Felix jetter ass girl relax. You got until next Olympics to get you ready good luck.
I take anyone seriously who has their tongue and nipples pierced…
Girl you got your ass whoop don’t play with us Jamaican😂😂
She needs to go to Tibet and  meditate, relax, find peace with herself. She needs to work her mental strength. She has the talent, she has the body... Just needs to work a little bit on her mindset, and she will succeed.
I like her up until she starting talking out of her as*! Go Jamaica 🇯🇲
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgAxd5z3Qio
1. Fail a drug test 2. Miss Olympics 3. Dead last in first race back  This young ladies in America, this gets you famous. Do these exact things and you’ll be famous and praised
Richardson needs to stay off social media get her self together, that post race interview didn’t make it any better 💯
I still feel she’s a great athlete
Anyone can see she wasn't running her hardest. She ran 11.14 today. If you think she was running her fastest then you are blind
She owes a public apology to Lewis Johnson and to her people in Dallas. Lewis Johnson is her elder/her language was disrespectful; no matter how nervous or upset she was
A lot people talking about being humble.. like she need to be quiet. Or act with lower standards of self. Lol Nuh be exuberant. Have high standards of self. Gtfoh with all that be humble.  When u come from humble beginnings to be there on that stage you already have been humble through hard work n dedication
she needs to fire to entire team, she embarrassed herself more after the race than she did on the track.
You Go Girl, Love your confidence!
ITS A MAN
I like her personality. I think her weakness is her lifestyle though, she come across as someone who likes to party alot etc, the things that comes with partying can slow down/ affect athletes in a very negative way. It did affected Usain Bolt in the earlier parts of his career too. Be strong and focused. I like all athletes especially the ones who make the game interesting with competitiveness. (A Jamaica mi ting deh tho)
Transgender looking & acting she need to humble herself I never heard losing sound like this.... She still smoking weed she needs a drug test before every race
The coming months-balancing the emotional, mental, physical, and social are gonna be crucial and vital-for Ms. Richardson 🔥Pray she gas a solid, top-to-bottom, support system in place 🔥
You are not a professional.  You cant be apologizing every minute for your behavior.  I'm counting you out because you make excuses for your behavior...who's going to take you seriously?You are supposed to be a professional...keep it up and me canceling you out isn't important. Whats important is...is this the real you? Do you have any type of self control?
she's done. the girls that smoked her are the future.
They keep saying she's a baby. Athing Mu is 19, go look at her interviews
STOP making excuses for her!!!
She's over reacting to hide the hurt which is understandable especially when you're that young in the limelight. But she gonna bawl her eyes out once she hits the front door at the house
Those Jamaicans have established their reputation in sports...they are a force to be reckoned with. She probably lost her nerves...
Hmmm.. Weave, Dracula nails, tattoos, saying no excuses while offering a ton, and an inability to stop worrying about what ppl think of her. Good thing she is an athlete cause the optics are a disaster.  Get around more mature people, woman.
Glad she lost. She slow
S.R.:My passion will show right after I smoke this blunt... 😂😂😂😂
She has a lot of growing up to do. The world will be brutal to her until then.  I hope that she doesn't read all of the negative comments nor let it depress her.
I like the piercings under her shirt.
Plenty of race to come, she will roast her competitors in the next race
God doesn't support junkies  home gurl
She burst of anger right after come on sis you not ready to be in the spotlight
Smoked salmon 🤣
she needs to stop appropriating white women culture with her hair
Congratulations to All the young ladies
If you hadn't those heavy ugly wig and the other things,you may have been a little bit quicker.
Typical black chick now these days. Put a fork in her she's done!
Yall hating on a kid😭😂😂☠️☠️☠️☠️she was on a month suspension and still came to run with the greatest give her her props.
Why do people consider it “hating” because people are saying she needs to humble herself?
Can’t trust a Woman who wears fake wigs and fake nails
This girl is on something stronger than weed
Proverbs 16:18
A warrior chill out you run track say your lungs 🫁 don't agree
You win some u loose some😒
You can see the nervous energy with her. She's trying to cover up the embarrassment of her defeat.  She really needs to to learn from her mistakes, grow and train hard to have a successful  comeback. It would have been a class act for her to congratulate the winner.
Girl shut up and learn to run. We got the three Queens 🇯🇲. U ain’t one.
Smoking that weed
How can she run with them long ass nails? 😳
She talk like she high still and sounds like she wana cry
Boy she is a whole clown out here she was in last place
That sweet girl act is just a act her attitude stinks and disgusting 🤣 #loser
Her confidence thou
3:14 congratulations .thank u..congrats for what and thank u for what
Feminist defeated !!!!!
Bih was dead last
Hope she come back stronger than ever!!! Never fold!!!
If only she was this humble all along, shame it took an embarrassing loss to do it. After the race she walked off the track, didn’t even congratulate the winner then went on to do that terrible interview.  Yesterday she was disrespectful to the Jamaican ladies on stage at the press conference. They taught her a lesson. She’s probably thinking of endorsements and convincing people to stick with her here.
Y’all at home hating on her while she just got a big pay check for last place while y’all talking for free😂😂
Man this is just a cry for help at this point. She needs a PR team immediately!!!!!
I think her defense is up because of the Olympics controversy.  I hope she let's that melt from her because she has nothing to prove to anyone, but herself.  Keep focus and say less.
Y’all internet folks was riding her wave now YALL are mocking and tearing her down! I can’t stand y’all! You mf’s get out there and run! Sha’Carri you’re a winner in my eyes! Keep going Queen! The city behind you! Believe that
❤️❤️❤️
She is such a fake. Just humble ur self
She showed the world that is back…,actually in the back..,of the pack.
She is 0-9. She came in dead last. She is disillusioned.
If you're a warrior you wouldn't have started to ease up as soon as you saw the jamaicans spacing away from u.. shut up and be humble..
She seems a nice and sweet Girl. I kinda like her. She has to train hard and stay focused and being the young she is she should be very good at next Olympics.
This girl on some shit. Can we stop hyping her up already?  Let's move on to real talent
Na that was an L.
Once she humbles herself, she may just enjoy some long term success. Running skill is one thing. Sportsmanship calls for higher set of skills including maturity. When are those around her going to provide some public relations coaching for this young woman? I’d like to enjoy seeing her do well.
You just need to be humble… ThTs the lesson you should take away from this season! Be humble
They should be interviewing the Jamaicans, not the person who came in last.
Subway pulled her aside and told her to calm down
Nike called her to fix it. Her attitude is 🗑️🗑️ she walked off didn't say congratulations to the winner
U are that girl But that girl needs to be humble, ur ego will be ur downfall, too much talk for someone who came in last
She’s angry
⭐⭐⭐DON'T DO DRUGS!🤣🤣
U hear those take laugh🤣🤣😂 now the joke is on you #123🇯🇲🔥
Please don’t go back in the lab but go back on the track and train naturally!!!
Fack dat!!! Love her
I love her she's a sweet girl. And motivating I like that she keeps God first.
BLM.
Lmao…interview as fake as her hair, nails, eyelashes…etc
She just needs to humble herself, talk alot less, and be all about her skill. Because today was a perfect lesson for her. She tried to be nice, sparkly and all to the interviewer, but I can tell she is eating herself up inside from her performance. And the interview before this one right after the the race said it all.
Congrats to our black queens of Jamaica dominating and winning.  Elaine and Shelly is amazing!!!   Sha'Carri, don't give up....you're only 21yrs old.  Your day is coming!!!
She's so well spoken... poet laureate
She mad because they made her miss the Olympics her arms are small and legs .
NIKE PR team called her after that post interview she gave. 😂😂😂😂
Media put too much pressure to sha'carri
You're make a come back this your first race from suspension miss out on the Olympic you're body has to get back in too it took to many time off now you're back in it this the first race for you after U.S. trails now prove it on the next event
Good old fashioned butt whupping
Humble pie served in 10,5s damn that is brutal
Blah, blah, blah…
I really rate you shaccarri but u cant be a role model with that behavior! I mean thats the worst post interview i have ever watched.not this one thw one before....btw this is an excellent interview
Last place; very disappointed in her.   At least the other 2 Americans showed up
