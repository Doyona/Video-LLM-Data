It’s time for Russian people to rise up against the war. Especially military age men. It’s better to protest, be arrested, and go to jail instead of being drafted and killed fighting a unjust war
I like that the protesters brought the yellow/blue balloons in the police van at 1.25 :).  You're going to arrest me; fine, I'm bringing my balloons!
Navalny  must be  out  come oppositions  be  brave enough to overthrow Russians pres Putin  Emerge  once again  navalnys cohorts
I do not trust the West a bit.
Don't give up the united states' people got your back Lonnie ray

F you Putler, you're losing and we arent stepping down. This isnt a about "Russian territorial security" this is about your position as dictator. Youre going down, and no army will ever have to cross your border to do that.  My respects to the ordinary russian people and their workers.
Pray for the Russian peoples protection
Pray for their safety against Putins suppression
GOOD JOB PROTESTERS
THATS A GOOD ACTIO OF D RUSSIAN PEOPLE THEY MUST PROTEST AGAINST PUTIN ONE MAN AGAINST MAJORITY
These so called riot police need to be dealt with in a very severe and determined manner, they are traitors to the people of Russia.
They are the true heroes of Russia
Not Rocket Science to figure out they’re next.
There IS NO WAR
In Mother Russia, government protests you.
The Russian Federation is a satanist state
My People are not cowards.... We are just too unlucky to have that government
Non Violent: https://youtu.be/GP0BkjnJDWo
Can you imagine this happens in the US? Americans always go along with their government even when they know The government is Wrong.
The antiwar protests should be staged in Brussels and DC and European cities not Russia .. These protests should be staged in London and DC and Paris and Ankara and Amsterdam who are distributing weapons in Ukraine all countries distribution weapons In Ukraine....these are the warmongers suooorting the war Russia is not waging war against anyone he's launching a special military operation again st those supplying arms to Ukraine
The while if Europe is filled with f35s and  war machines aimed at Russia and they u re rebelling? Don't they watch TV? Biden Russia will face consequences who is he threatening?

It's  time they stood up for themselves . I'm proud to see it
This is the downfall of puttin
Same idiots in these comments were calling for violence against protestors of the unprovoked invasion of Iraq in 2003. America, must, go.
Yes The Ukrain war is a racket
British news station ITV reported that over 80% of the Russian public supported the war
i think the peoples in russia have the right to express their unhappy feelings about the actions of their regime in the war putins declared on ukraine.  by heart certainly obvious the destructions and the lost of life of innocent ukrainians also hurt most of the russians.. it wont be a joyful feelings.. russians and ukranian are one families.. everyone whoever and where ever they are must speak to russias regime to stop the  war..
This is great, it is the only way to stop Putin.
I'm am Russians I'm am proud and fine withy my country's military purging innocent Ukraine soldiers and citizens. i went to Australia beacuse if russia gets invaded...
Putin dictator get the bully out ,killing Russia ,people are nice ,Putin is no good a murderer needs to be removed
The same attacks on protesters happen in UK every other week by British police ! The Armed British police actually come to the doors of protesters, Break down the door and cause a lot of damage when they search the homes, Scum fraudulent judges and magistrates give the violent degenerate police the search warrants
America tore it's self apart for 180 days burning churches, police stations, court houses, libraries and louting that caused billions worth of damages. I don't think we are in any position to throw stones. Let's stop violence baiting and news stations promoting there agenda tell us the truth and p1ss off

This is a personal vendetta for Putin.
All channels  are paid by Americans. Why there's no video of Americans protest against war with Russian.
I live in Russia 🇷🇺 and I am AGAINST THE WAR!  I love Ukraine 🇺🇦 and Western countries!  We must be friends,  we want to be friends in Russia.  No to WAR!  I thank you people who say nice words about protesters.. 🇺🇸 🌎
Pooptintler have hus days counted.
It is sad to see how the people return to violence.  Heros, freedom, free world, Demokratie, human rights, duty, all this are words used in the Patriot-game. Remember Vietnam, and realize the free world is not so good and the enemy is not so bad.
Russian fascist
God Bless the Russian people. We are all brothers and sisters .We all breath the same air and we must work together
Wake up russiqm Police!!!!!!!!!
Pls COMPARE these protests with Anti IRAQ WAR in London, that was based on BIGGEST LIE in human history. TONY BLAIR, a WAR CRIMINAL enjoyed killing milliones Iraqis & thousands young soldiers to become multibillionaire!!
I know more about a few isolated Russian protests in random Russian cities than I do about Epstein's death, the origins of Covid, the Rothschilds' banking system, the origins of our leaders' wealth, the Las Vegas shooter, the Waukesha slaughter, Hilary Clinton's emails, the 2020 election fraud and why World Trade Centre 7 randomly imploded on 9/11.
watching news, when there's a  protest, apparently you could be arrested just for passing by taking the dog for a walk, careful eh.
Those people are heros
The people don't want war always, but why western  countries wanna block at the Russian civils ...............they don't have any guilty about this war !!!

Putin is evil
China, Russia and Islam are the enemies of humanity. چین، روسیه و اسلام دشمنان بشریت هستند.
I don't see much difference between Trudeau and Putin when it comes to peaceful demonstrations.
What a Joke, Stand up the take their ARMS and change Your Constitution and ARM all Citizens. Those Citizens without ARMS are a Slave to those who have them. Learn from the Americans and suffer a lot less?... Joke of Day: What are 3 wolves and a rabbit asking what’s for dinner? A Socialist/Communist Country.... What are 3 wolves and a rabbit with a Shotgun asking what is for dinner? A Free Loving Americans!!!! Hurrah!!!!  When this is over, I guarantee that when this is over, the Ukrainian People will never trust any government, domestic of Foreign, just the Americans… IF Ukraine Citizen all had a right to have ARMS, I GURANTEE THE RUSSIAN WOULD HAVE TAKEN A BEATING AT BEGINNING OF THEIR INVASION.
Putin is almost as repressive as Trudeau in Canada.
God is  aware of your life and action. The 🌎🌍🌏 wil  not l tolerate Tyrants.
Kremlin laughs at it's People in Russian because they Know Citizen without ARMS ARE SLAVES TO THOSE WHO HAVE THEM.... Learn from the U.S.A?
respect for the protestors. They all want peace and if They dare stand against, They will be imprisoned .
This is how organized resistance starts, Putin's putting his opposition altogether, (in prison) allowing them to organize further, same happened with dozens of movements in history, which became revolutions?
Deep in their hears, is waiting for the end of the world to come…??😭😭Oh... no......  Human nature is dark… we do terrible things sometimes…  The relationship between the oppressor and the oppressed is not confined to any one country…  That is civilization, we make progress and fall back… We cannot control what happens but we can use what happens. We have so much reserves of love and support inside us, if we can just remember that in our mind and move on. Now, the world can be a nasty crazy place out there,  we need a lot of courage and we need a lot of resilience after that,  and we will fall down before we stand up… 🕊
BRAVO brave Russians!
Its so sad not more say No to War.   I mean, its 2022 and we have some Dude start a War cause of his personal Opinions...
Thank you. Keep going.
Net Voyny 📢📢📢
Protesters being dragged off.  Looks like Canada!!!!
Now, if Putin was smart he would just ignore protests, like they did for the Gulf war. 10000 of us in Philly and the news copters hovered in south Philly and the 25 people that rallied for the war the next day got coverage.
Cmon Russian people start an internal war with Putin
Rusian people keep standing up for what is right! We the rest of the world can see you! We know that the Russian people do not all support Putin's war.
https://youtu.be/NCeVa1-rXHU
Ahem....Bring it On...U can't touch this... yep....U can't touch them....             The spirit will always prevail over the sword it never fails...hah.
Pass it on to the  Russian people Says IAM who Iam Amen and amen

This is the down full of Putin
Hmm I think the west up to something sneaky they always are think about how the US supply them soo much military equipments compare to other countries that needed help maybe USA has a plan to get Ukraine onto their side to get closer to Russia and set up military base and more expansions.. USA don’t help with out a reason lol 😂
We need to boycott shell they are still importing Russian oil as of  march2022
It is not to be demonstrated, but to be revolutionized as in 1917.
#destroynato and #savepalestine
Oh just like Canada  home of the free   Yea not so much
death sentence for the murderer! 😥 #loveukraine #staywithukraine #nowar 💙💛🇺🇦💛💙
If only have the population of russia will join in, then the government is finish
Break your chains, stand up for your rights against dictatorship!!! Russian people, only you may stop him!
now it starts in russia. z nation  is going to put you down mr. putin.
I think that the majority of Russian people are supporting the war. If they were against it, much more people would come out to stop it, and the police wouldn't be able to control protests.
Putin is evil. Make a revolution for freedom!
He made a mistake invading Ukraine, his own people are against it.
Glory to Ukraine! Freedom to Russia!
Putin is out of touch with his people especially the younger generation !
#nowar
WOW, this shows how PUTIN  lied to everyone,  his people,  and the rest of the WORLD.  That shows what a Psycho PUTIN is.  Than he hides his family members in other countries.
Putin you have to know that your ego will be your undoing. Its actually a mature and respectable thing to show people you can talk and be reasonable. Win us over the right way/.
Only the Russian people can stop this madness.
Putin will order everyone of his people that are protesting to death,that’s how sick he is,love to Russians and Ukrainians that are fighting putin
This is what Putin fears…good for them
It should be done
The world has turned against Putin. and for good reason. The russian people "need" to stand up
Russians rise up! You know in your heart this is not right. Please do it for your future our future. We DON'T NEED WWIII
The only riot/protest that is acceptable. If BLM thought the police in America were oppressive, boy I'm sure they're glad they don't live in Russia
what about Palestine which was invaded by Israel, why are you silent?
Soon or later the people's will hang him..his days is just numbers now
Russian people need to get together and stop this mad man Putin or else world war 3 in coming this time many people will parish!
I’ll tell you one thing, the media has free content for the rest of this.
WW3 is upon us... In the next month there will be a possibility of a nuclear warhead hitting Ukraine and possibly US
Russia Attacking their own people 😢destruction to Ukraine violence needs to stop' find Peace" resolution🙏
Putin is making criminals out of his own people. Russian people must turn against the crazy man.
If Zelenskiy wanted peace for Ukraine and save the lives of its people.   He would talk to Vladimir Putin directly Man to Man with the following conditions, also listening to some conditions from Putin, obviously for the security of Russia, Ukraine, and the West.    Zelenskiy's request would be:   That Vladimir Putin stops invading and withdrawing all invading armies from Eukrania and stops interfering in Ukraine MILITARY.  And at the same time, Zelenskiy reject any intervention from another country and did not enter NATO and be NEUTRAL and not be influenced by any country and declared my country A FREE AND SOVEREIGN COUNTRY.  And only accept trade agreements from the United States and Russia or any other country, convenient for both countries.    WITHOUT COMMERCIALIZING OR ACCEPTING ANY TYPE OF WEAPONS AND ANY MILITARY BASE OF ANY COUNTRY.  The media tries to make a hero of Zelenskiy, but everyone knows that he is just a clown puppet of the USA and NATO
Give them weapons they will and the war
This terroist probably killed all these people he had arrested. Its time to destroy this coward
It’s amazed with that many people and some holding up signs it’s a maze how some people cannot help the other one being arrested. If that was in America if someone was getting arrested other people would jump in and beat up the cops and help one another. Break my heart so much that they can face up to 15 years for war protest
Only Putin wants to play fire and his people was not on his back,Russian people must now change their leader, real Russian people who doesn't want war is the real Russian people....I stand with you! respect to you!
I would never dare to say that war hurts us, russian people, more than Ukraine, but it does affect us and not just in moral or ethical sense. Putin destroys his own country and it's citizens. Why? We endured your reign. We endured stable fall of economy. There was not enough protests to ever affect your leadership. Now, there will be - sadly way too late.
These mass protests are fake. The government organized them, even gave some protesters anti Putin signs. By Russian law, you have to have a permission, it takes time, besides, in Russia it's difficult to gather such a crowd against the government in one day, and what organization did it. Those that were arrested, are separate small groups that gathered without permission, illegally. It doesn't mean everybody supports Putin, but most people do. Even abroad, they support him, Russian Orthodox churches in the US defend his war against the US and NATO. It does not make sense, but Russians still think the world, mostly the US, want to conquer them
Stop protesting, Start coup d'etat.
Ban Russian vodka in Connecticut.
he never said he have the support of the people lolz obvious people dont want war..
What else to expect from tsars fashist Gestapo
This takes a lot of bravery.  While we in the west lose some money; the Russian people might lose their freedom if not worse.  You are heroes as well
The Russian people are prisoners and suffering there for years. They cannot protest against his government. People are jailed and killed if they say bad things against about them. My Russian friends say that they can't remove him from the presidency 😢 they watch all his atrocities for years. They said that Putin is a dictator and want to rebuild the Union Soviet.
Use your energy and time more efficiently, why don't Russians instead volunteer and go to Ukraine and tell your soldiers to come back? The rest of the world is giving up their citizens. Go see if your country even cares for your lives if you choose to go to Ukraine.
Putin.    Are you f-ing delusional?
THIS IS COMMUNISM AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE  HEADING IN THIS DIRECTION SO BE FOREWARNED
War solves absolutely nothing
Its time to make Russia a Democratic Country! Fall of Putin
Democracy has died so fast in Russia. It lasted 30 years
Now do “black live matter”s  other countries .. cop will drag u and die before you go jail .. so start saying thank you for usa and freedom
Wait until Putins army decides they want to go protect their parents and friends from the police.
Putin is leading Russia to become North Korea.
Hard to believe a single MADMAN (VLADIMIR PUTIN) is causing this cruel war.

I am so glad WE HAVE Our Host Mr. SMITH! Another hero in our lifetime! So glad he is out of misleading FOX25. Mr. Smith was the real/truthful ONE in there!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙏🏻
Respect to the war protesters. They will be on the right side of history.
Man this is crazy. I really hope they are heard.
Russian People must support Ukraine. Say No war for mankind.
We need a Russian summer.
those police beatings of protesters makes me think I'm watching a Trump rally.
People are tired of war mongers! Protests from its own people and his army can deter Putin!  Both countries are descendants from dame ancestors!  Many Russians do not like this!
NWO propaganda here. Putin is the only thing that stands in their way of world domination. Kiev has been exterminating the people of the Donbas for 8 years! Ukraine's military capability needed to be destroyed. There was no invasion, just airstrikes of military targets, no civilian targets. Just boycott these propaganda stations please.
President Vladimir Putin Declared War Against Ukraine vs Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Issued Vaccine Mandates Against Science & Will of Canadians.   Russians arrested at anti-war protests in Russia vs Canadians arrested at anti-vaccine mandate protests in Ottawa.
Putin is a Hitler of modern day and we have so many in the world such as China and North Korea leaders. They are no good to mankind and a mass murderers.
When I see the Russian police arresting protesters, I can't help but think of the Gestapo in Germany.
God is their watching every moment and can do anything more then stupid putin
Get reed of Puttin! Please let those people go! Russia needs to be free l police stand with your people!!!
Hello humanity. I am a resident of a small town in Russia. And I don't like war either. All my childhood and all my youth I was taught that war is evil. I remember when I was little I drew drawings in which the main plot was - for the peaceful sky above my head. My great-grandfather fought against the Nazis in World War II, I hardly remember him, but I remember his face for the rest of my life when, as a five-year-old child, I asked him about how he beat the Nazis. A face full of grief, pain and longing for those whom he then lost. He didn't tell me this and told me never to ask about it. But he answered my other question "Why did you go to war?" He replied that this horror should never touch those he loves. So that this never happens again. I thought all my compatriots knew it too. But I communicated with them: in the store I communicated with sellers, in the messenger I communicated with my housemates. And they seemed to be seized by some kind of madness. They all praise Putin. They all say that Putin is fighting against the Nazis. They all do not believe that our state unleashed a war. Even when I cited a scan of a military legal dictionary for military personnel as arguments. They are all in solidarity. My parents, grandmother, uncle. I'm scared. I can not believe this. It hurts me. I'm scared to go to a rally, because I see a picture that they will all tear me apart. They'll be stoned. That no one, no one else feels or thinks like me. I know that I'm acting like a coward, and that makes it worse for me. I need your advice. What should I do? What should I do? Sorry for any mistakes, I used google translate.
Putin kills anyone who opposes him, goddamn the russsians who protest are very very brave, my heart goes out to the Ukrainians fighting Putins army and the Russians protesting, I live in America but I’m from Poland originally god bless Ukraine!!
Putin's invasion of Ukraine may have the unintended consequence of triggering the beginning of the end of  his rule.
It’s horrifying to think that most of these Russian protesters will just suddenly “disappear”
RUSSIANS ALSO HAD THEIR OWN  "   EDSA PEOPLES POWER "
Tôi thích những điệu 💃 và những người bạn Nga yêu hòa bình . Nhưng tôi khinh thường kẻ gian ác Putin . Bởi hắn là kẻ giết người điên loạn .
Russians are scared as hell because the agressiveness of Putin backfired. Are you out of your mind Putin? You want to order nuclear weapons when you are invasing another nation.
The USA sided with the fascists, and they pretend to be peacemakers - criminals! The righteous judgment is near!
Russian people, that's right, putin hitler is stealing your future, don't let that, we all have seen, this is a crazy monster
CNBC= fake news
where were you for 8 years when the US produced fascists in Ukraine? your media is lying to you.
to Russian people, do not believe your government Putin is a liar, manipulator and dictator.
🚨🚨History report🚨🚨Karma is coming to Putin and will be Putin his place.  Watch. RealTalk💯
People  of Russia ABDICATE  PUTIN.  Lock your  arms together in multitudes and for peace. Take down Putin,  young people,come together,show by strength  in numbers. Peace to Russia.
No Russians need war all out war on Putin!  Death to the dictator.
Putin is going to be forced into a corner and he’s going to use nuclear weapons
Why are there so many hired actors in Russia to gain sympathy from other nations??
can you find the footage of the cops in small town in russia protesting with the russian people? can't seem to find it anymore on youtube russia has most likley blocked it, but CNBC have more resources then civilians
Don't tall realize it's in the usa interest to have ties to Ukraine and Russia doesn't want that for security reasons.  U can't believe anything u see on American tv period.  Wake up do some research
Fake
My heart goes out to every Ukrainian and Russian, who is against Putin's war.
Looks like Trudeau
This will turn NUCLEAR
RÚSSIA 😍😍😍😍
brazil e RÚSSIA 😍😍😍😍🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😍😍😍😍😍 vida longa a Rússia.  😍😍😍
This is heartbreaking to see this innocent civilian of Ukraine and Russia is suffer with one demonic person
its tough to be under tyrannical totalitarian dictatorship. thoughts and prayers for russian and chinese citizens
russia needs to revolt against putin
Putin is done!
need no protest and getting arrest latter ..... Next Friday , all moscovites must declare to have got COVID and stay home for a few days .....  if all russians do that Putin will be isolate
The people of the world -- inside Russia and without -- know that war is no longer the solution to international disputes of any kind.  The world is made better by cooperation and the pursuit of mutual interests.  The people of Russia see the future.  Their leader is a relic of the past.  It's time for a change.
Stand fast people of Russia keep standing up against this madness of Mr Putin keep standing saying No to war
My adopted Uncle Ray retired a LT. Colonel and had served in BOTH WW1 and WW2. He co-founded the first Masonic Lodge in Berlin only weeks after we entered Berlin in WWII. He was a 70 year member of the Masons. He was at the Nuremburg trials as a defense attorney for several Japanese generals who were all sentenced to death for War crimes. After his military he served as a federal Judge in Baltimore. He lived 94 years as the greatest human I have ever known. He taught me many things I still think about today and try to practice. Why all this? Uncle Ray travelled the World in his life both as a soldier and a Diplomat. In the 70's he told me something I never forgot. He encountered and dealt with Russians all his life. He went to Moscow at the height of the Cold War on many legal matters. He once told me at a thanksgiving meal when I was kid that regardless of what I will hear about the Russian people over the upcoming decades,that I should always remember it's only the leaders of the communist Party and Government I should worry about, the Russian people in general are NO different than anyone else I will ever meet anywhere in this big World. Then gave me a handful of russian rubles he brought back (which was totally Illegal at the time) and told me all the stories about the good people he met and worked with in Russia and how they so admired America and wanted what we have. He also told me that we should never let those people down,and keep their hopes up high so that one day they might be free like us. I never forgot that.. We can not stand by and allow ANYTHING to crush that hope. It only reflects what we are SUPPOSED to be standing for on the World stage.
BIG difference between how police arrest protesters in the US and Russia:  IN the US police use Tear Gas, Rubber bullets, Water Canons, Attack Dogs, Batons, Armored Vehicles, and Snipers.  Big difference!
Tell the Russian protesters to rush the police and overwhelm them they can take over the country by standing together Americans love the citizens of Russia but not your corrupt leader vlad Putin he has stolen your countries wealth and has caused you to go without you do this and we will take out our tyrant Donald Trump he needs to be eliminated as well without all these political evil dictators all the people of the world would get along like brothers and sisters Let the people of the world unite and take our world back people of the world are LOVED
I'll never watch this raging liberal and homosexual. Glad he was kicked out of fox news.
Brave Russian people did similar protests in 68, sadly there were even suicide reports of USSR army officers in eastern Europe after they realized fully what they were sent to do... Russians always had their braveness in them
The Russian people should arise and overturn Putin’s tyranny.
In a dictatorship people are usually TORTURED in jail. Putin is a monster.
Putin is evil personified.
Proven fake news.
More power to brave Ukrainians and Russians for standing up to Putin.  If Putin would be taken out of power, the world will be that much more peaceful.
Pro nazis protest https://youtu.be/G6V0U-AXXoo
Russia should not be at war. They make good amplifier tubes. I like Russian tubes.
No war Yugoslavia, no war Iraq, no war Libya, no war Syria Two-faced hypocritical Anglo-Saxony
I pray that nothing happens to those protestors, but I know that’s just hopeful thinking.
Trump supporters are saying it’s antifa
Shame on Putin. Respect for the people of Russia who are out on the streets protesting against their own government that is so evil & tyrannical. Our heart goes out to Ukraine. But sitting here thousands of miles away... this is all that we can do... unless someone has a better idea !
Каждые семь секунд погибает российский солдат. Украина - большое русское кладбище. Русские - сдавайтесь!
,,Take me to the magic of the moment On a glory night Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams With you and me,,  from Romania we are with you ,don.t give up  Love🇷🇴
The Russian protesters are inspiring. Defying the dictatorship that tries to silence the opinions of their people. Chanting no war should not be grounds for arrest!
RT News is more refreshing to watch than this fake drivel of rubbish.
❣❣❣❣❣❣❣❣
May God be With peace to spread into every persons soul and mind
Putin is nothing more than a coward
German Sophie Scholl, executed in Germany in 1943 for distributing anti-Nazi leaflets. Her last words were: "How can virtue triumph when practically no one is willing to sacrifice themselves for it?" It's such a beautiful sunny day and I have to go."
This is to show that world leaders have to much power.
As everywhere in the world, there are lowly creatures which, under the pretext of just doing their job, help to enforce injustice.
I  am so happy to see people stand against their evil leader .thank you Russian people . You can change the evil mind set .
The protesters may be immigrants!!!!!.
0:34 I hope they are not murdered in the custody ,to silence the protesters 😟😞😞😞
Respect for Putin even though some powerful countries sanctioned Russia as well as Putin but he is not surrendering 🙏Putin🙏. Long live Russia long live putin.
Do not arrest any body leads to failure arrest war
Putin is alone people elected Putin are the great problem. Putin sit on table talk to your brother nation Ukraine.
Very brave to demonstrate in such a country where you are at risk when you do so
War never changes.
AMERICA, BRITAIN, GIARMONY, AUSTRALIA, HISTORICAL DISLOYAL,                                           अमेरिका, ब्रिटेन, जर्मनी, आस्ट्रेलिया, ऐतिहासिक गद्दार हैं। 😡😡
抗议有用吗?啊?有本事就让北约接受乌克兰。
Obviously protesting doesn't do anything to help
As one of those , who were there on the streets of Moscow, i just want to say that we never wanted this to happen, and we never thought that could happen. I have a lot of friends in Ukraine, we're still in touch, and i cant even imagine how hard it is for them. Though i should say, that the absolute majority of us, Russians, never supported all of it, never voted for this government. it hurts so much, especially, knowing that speaking out on the street does so little to stop this. But that's all we can do right now. And we wont stop, even though we have everything to lose.  Regular Russians never wanted it.  We're sorry to our brothers and sisters from Ukraine that we can do so little. It hurts so much. We're sorry.
Puttin is a yellow belly for hiding behind a button 🤣 give them hell
Fake News. Very small group of Globalist agitators. Russia is forced nt NATO to take Ukraine before NATO destroys it.
When people in Europa protest against Covid restrictions it is ok for police to use violence?
He has FOX news support
Government is made by people and it is made for people . Hear ur people
Good for them. The west stands behind them. Save your country and think future. Praise God for your courage! They can not lock up all of you..
What Respect means?
Quick question. do most people actually understand why Russia Invaded Ukraine? the news doesn't seem to bring light on this much. instead they cry out democracy or independence. theres much more going on forcing this invasion .
kharkiv street battle..Putin is losing https://youtu.be/hscvR5mihT0
They can't arrest all russians. Keep protesting!
This is why Freedom of Speech is in the 1st Amendment.
Respect for Russians and Ukrainians (except for the anti-Russian neo-Nazis who started this conflict in 2013).
A crazy thug is V. Putin.  A state can never be owned by an individual like Putin.  e.g. Russia of Russians have a great business relationship with Bangladesh, and this friendship will continue but insanely ambitious and greedy V. Putin is nothing but a parasite and should be brought to Justice for crimes against humanity in "Saddam of Iraq's trial style" -which must be applied as well  to all other similar criminals including just a few individuals identifiable as "Covid-19 Business Master-planners in UK, USA, Israel, China" and other ones in N. Korea, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, Iran + etc. Anglo-Hebruish advisers of Covid business in US-CA are causing political sabotages for fooled jb's and jt's leaderships in North America. Precious knowledge: The reality created by fear causing Covid-criminals that's inflicting sufferings on countless 'hard-working folks in all corners of the world. [More of insights: POTUS: jb of us naively is now doing a mistake of undermining the sentiment of the majority of common folks, and it's already getting too late for him to engage in damage control mode. Re: dumb heads that have failed to get to the core of the subject matter and catch  the masterminds of Covid-Business-criminals (including profiteers from sales of PCR tests and related nonsense equipments).  It's sad to see, for an unclear purpose or reason, our leaderships in North America is still implementing the profiteering, evil agenda of outlandish 'Covid Business master-planners'. If the sense of morality was stronger than personal interest or ego, then "our leadership - under outlandish political pressure" would grab the opportunity and use it as an aliby to indirectly help stop grand thievery of public funds through local agents like A. Fauci and then by big evil-network of Covid Vaccine and Tests.  2022 is the perfect time to amend or make and enforce new sets of stricter laws in kind of Saudi or North Korea styles so that severe punishments or long term jail sentences with hard labor (to compensate for and defray the costs of incarnation) are imposed against social criminals as that are badly required by almost all the crime infested (products of too lenient, humatatian 1950 - 1990s VIEWs) nations including Canada, USA and Europe. All the justices departments in the world, unlike the dishonestly, rotten British standard of justice system, are in desperate need of "BETTER SERVING MODEL OF NEW AGE" enforcing tougher punishments against social crimes whether it be wealthy Bill Gates or a poor Street mugger. There will be no alternative to strongest possible punishments against all perpetrators in social levels, the murderers and defrauders. Period. Hey agents of secretive systemic manipulators of evil UK in disguise of harmless bosses of public organizations, banking, insurance, health, trade sectors, crown Corporation, "registrars, clerks, gate-keepers of Courts of Law in North America". .************ Now as of mid February 2022, dear Justin Trudeau and Joe Biden, please stop the nonsense rhetoric of Covid restrictions you both are continuing beyond acceptable limit in terms of public credibility and patience in North America, and therefore must adjust your speeches as per the reality and aspirations of North Americans in year 2022. Dear jt and jb, be informed that both of you are definitely in wrong direction with this Omicron (by listening to advice of your hebruish-anglo advisers with outlandish agenda). You can choose either: to hear the voice of majority and act in respect to their wishes or to continue to suppressing general public sentiment, but surely you or jb can't fool the ordinary North American citizenry anymore with the illusory so called scientific data etc. propagated by a special interest small group in profiteering Covid Business. Remember, the base of supports you and jb got from me since bo's days in the office as POTUS (go through the hundreds of my emails sent to your desks with non-violent motivations and precious insights for Liberals & Democrats on either side of US-CA border). Dear jt & jb, instead of acting complacent and inadvertently destroying your own credibility, positions and party bases, wake up and look out of the windows at the sheer volumes of unhappy average folks along with the Canadian truckers that with the support of common folks all over, are actually turning into majority, gathering in your front yards, they are on global streets from Sweden to India, whereas the safe-haven of Covid business masterplanners, the hub of Covid Vaccine and test related material tradings -the UK (wait and see, as of February 1, 2022 PM of UK: bj shall begin to singing totally different tune of 'antilockdown, no restrictions Covid rhetoric') as if they are the first rescuers and liberator of the world from the catastrophic Covid. Soon, just like you, jb of US would be overwhelmed by general public reactions, and be feeling abandoned once "brain-washed by the outlandish Covid criminals" - he, out of his foggy mind, gets in touch with the reality of present time!  Do not even listen to the advice of those 'good for nothing specialists influenced by big pharma covid vaccine money'.  Regardless of well-bribed or not, with common-sense you guys in top positions, if not 'delusional like A. Fauci or B. Gates with insanely greed for money' should ask this logical, simple question to your own selves: where is the regular 'constantly mutating seasonal flue in this winter of 2022'? ??? You have the answer: "Oh my cron" is nothing but a variant of naturally modified form of lab-modified Covid version of winter flu - which became merchandise of Covid business criminals, in the name of scientific data researches in labs of UK, China, USA etc., have been creating Virus-panic with fear mongering twisted facts via broadcast in all sorts of media with only one purpose of making furtunes in collaboration of their accomplices like "Bill Gates, the criminally motivated ownerships of profiteering Covid vaccine and related product manufacturers".  In 2022, the above stated insatiably greedy criminals attempted again to get most of what's left in public health funds in care of poorly or unwisely run global governments elsewhere including our North America. And by befriending with and believing in the words of North American agents of the evil "a fringe, British Anglo-hebruish agenda of a very small group" mistakenly you guys are 'caught in a trap and clearly seen on the global stage'. However, now in 2022, both of you (jt & jb with my precious insights) shall have the opportunity to come clean and lead the entire world 'of hard-working, good, honest folks, in very transparent, real progressive ways by exposing to the world all the truth and facts you have learned about the deliberately plotted and wel-orchestrated Covid-19 business matter and the positive impact of such acts of morality on collective sentiments of global public will never be forgotten by the ensuing generations, moreover, all of us shall have a "forever honorable, higher image historically for initiating a non-violent mission of positive change worldwide". Detached from the North-American sources of wealth through mainly Insurance-Underwriting, Vaccine, Medicine, Bombs, War-toys, USAID, Canadian natural resources, oil, money printing businesses etc., the 'furtively ever systemically manipulating', double faced, evil-masterminds, a very small, Hebruish-Anglo group are already engaged in covert trade relationship with China and its' business partners in order to continue their usual invisible crimes of thievery of wealth from other nations, but by the whim of *cosmic thing* their identities would be exposed along with all the associated ones with such filthy, thuggish money making strategies using the so called scientific data, attempting to continue in 2022 further expansion of fear mongering virus business, creating situations for wars, productions of destructive materials, bombs, war-toys, war machines etc. by propaganda-broadcast of items like natural fuel shortages, 'global warming etc. etc. . {N. B. Semites are dangerous, there are half a dozen kinds of races including jews in Arabian territories, and less than only 0.000001% of them are evil-mastermind Semetic criminals like Bill Gates -who have xenophobic depopulating kind of mass murderers' mentality) and sadly, a nonsense, anti-semitic law (made a century ago after Hitler-Era ended, and in 2022 it desperately in need to be repealed) is now being used to protect the above noted criminals at top only and not even slightly to benefit the 99.99999% ordinary, good, peace-loving honest jews, Arabs (and other minorities as well}.  ************* Fact finding as example: Bill Gates is one of the master culprits -who first became billionaire from creating so named computer virus (hard sisk of computer jamming cookies) and selling mainly through crooked UK based prducts of so called computer-anti-virus softwares, without being held responsible by any authority for their defrauding business  practices -which encouged the same elusive group of culprits plot a new evil scheme that involved a lab-modified mixture of humanly transmittable seasonal flu virus with anthrax type other viruses. Then, tests of human-virus: Ebola was performed in some locations in Africa with satisfactory results -which in a labiratory modified and developed form with a new name: Covid-19 has been tested in recent past on crowded places like Cruise Ships and Markets with successful outcome.  (WRITTEN 22 MONTHS AGO: Readers of this informational thought-work should help generate awareness among fellow folks in all corners of the world about the outlandish STRATEGIES to create virus fear and broadcast worldwide by which the highly secretive jobs of "fear of Covid virus spreading" has been done using most of the fooled global governments like America, Bangladesh, Canada, Zimbabwe etc.).]. ....
Putin  Russians hate you!

I hope , these most brave people wouldn't killed by these fuckng corrupt polices of Putin!!!!!!!!!

Not surprising at all.  Politicians playing in the playground while the public is ignored and abused.
Puttin is a yellow belly for hiding behind a button 🤣
In the name of Allaah The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful. There is no power except with Allaah The Most High, The Great. Despite my sadness over the mischoice of Prince Mohamed Bin Salman Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud due to his arrogance and insistence on not to release my Saudi and non-Saudi supporters from the prisons of KSA, it is a challenge from his Royal Highness Prince Mohamed Bin Salman to be stricken-down by Allah into clinical death if Nasser Mohamed Al-Yamani was truly Imam Mahdi Allah's caliph on the worlds; as a result, Allah has Stricken him down with His firm plan, COVID, in no time shortly before he travels to Beijing, as Mohamed Bin Salman thinks himself to be safe from the plan of Allah Lord of the worlds and he was not an atom's weight suspicious that he will attend the opening of the Olympics in Beijing. And I know with knowledge of certainty that the Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman will not attend per the invitation of the president of China, the greatest of wrongdoers, and the dragon, Xi Jinping in Beijing the headquarters of the 2022 Olympics. I have advised Mohamed Bin Salman not to think himself to be safe from the plan of Allaah but unfortunately, he does not like advisors. However, COVID the firm plan of Allah that strikes down in the blink of an eye is not only dedicated to Prince Mohamed Bin Salman Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud but dedicated from Lord of the worlds to all decision-makers who did not take a lesson from this major incident And I, Allah's caliph on the worlds Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohamed Al-Yamani, swear by Allah the One the Overpowering that whoever does not take a lesson from among decision-makers of the governments of the worlds, the firm plan of Allah is going to strike him down in the blink of an eye or even sooner by the command of Allah the One Overpowering by the Word ( "Be" so it is ) in line with the Word of Allaah the Exalted : {فَتَرَى الَّذِينَ فِي قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ يُسَارِعُونَ فِيهِمْ يَقُولُونَ نَخْشَىٰ أَن تُصِيبَنَا دَائِرَةٌ ۚ فَعَسَى اللَّهُ أَن يَأْتِيَ بِالْفَتْحِ أَوْ أَمْرٍ مِّنْ عِندِهِ فَيُصْبِحُوا عَلَىٰ مَا أَسَرُّوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ نَادِمِينَ ‎﴿٥٢﴾‏ وَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَهَٰؤُلَاءِ الَّذِينَ أَقْسَمُوا بِاللَّهِ جَهْدَ أَيْمَانِهِمْ ۙ إِنَّهُمْ لَمَعَكُمْ ۚ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَأَصْبَحُوا خَاسِرِينَ ‎﴿٥٣﴾‏ يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَن يَرْتَدَّ مِنكُمْ عَن دِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِي اللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَهُ أَذِلَّةٍ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَعِزَّةٍ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ يُجَاهِدُونَ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَلَا يَخَافُونَ لَوْمَةَ لَائِمٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَن يَشَاءُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ وَاسِعٌ عَلِيمٌ ‎﴿٥٤﴾} {And you see those in whose hearts there is a disease (of hypocrisy), they hurry to their friendship, saying: "We fear lest some misfortune of a disaster may befall us." Perhaps Allah may bring a victory or a decision according to His Will. Then they will become regretful for what they have been keeping as a secret in themselves(52) and the believers will say, ‘Are these the men who swore by God using their strongest oaths that they were with you?’ All they did was in vain: they have lost everything. (53) O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion (Islam), Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers, fighting in the Way of Allah, and never afraid of the blame of the blamers. That is the Grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower. (54) 5:52-54 Perhaps many decision-makers in different countries of mankind would like to say: "We did not imprison your supporters, O Nasser Mohamed Al-Yamani, and we did not cause to them any harm " then Allah's caliph on the worlds Nasser Mohamed Al-Yamani replies to them and says: "Do you think Allah's caliph on the worlds Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohamed Al-Yamani will remove injustice from upon his supporters and that is it ?!

I am a defender of RUSSIA!  And I live in the United States of America!  Read my facebook comments:  JESIMIEL MILLAR FERNANDEZ!
am Praying for you all
The people of Russia 🇷🇺 have always been brothers and sisters of a peaceful world!! I fully support the health and well-being of all Russian citizens of the world.  Your leadership does not represent your hearts ♥.  Much of America 🇺🇸 will never consider you enemies.  Please  know that most of us understand the situation you're in and we are watching your defiance against Putin.  I was born here in America 🇺🇸 in New York.  I married a strong successful woman from Russia 🇷🇺 💪 she gave me too beautiful children ❤ that are the future! brothers both 🇷🇺 Russian and American 🇺🇲
Americans should not be fooled. Most Russians protest the war started by the US in 2014 when American diplomats helped overturn Ukrainian government. Most protesters are not against Putin. Those arrested were mostly those who were trying to start street fights, therefore low numbers of arrested. Putin created a tricky situation: if NATO interferes, it will prove him right, the US are the enemy.
Russian people knows this war is not right. The war is chosen by one guy, not Russian people and makes people suffer later.
Much respect for Russian people who've condemned this war! They are sO Brave !
Russians gonna burn Putin kingdom down lol
Руси и Срби браћа заувек
Isn't that George from Seinfeld?
Putin Is Lunatic.
It's better to walk alone than with a country going in the wrong direction.
all across Russia? You mean a couple protests in the largest cities that barely had 1000 people participating? Give me a break
CNBC =Soros paid pedo protectors , you will all hang for crimes against humanity as your pedo bosses are taken out ,well done Putin
Liars
More than 2mllions did shame in London Bush Tony Blair. Invasion Iraq. nothing was found. Us UK killer's women children in millions. Discustet u can go Invasion anyone u like. U like Hitler regime
Trudeau, you GOOF!  'Your goin down' and I don't mean on your boyfriend Putin either. Speaking of Putin, Putin, Putin... your just no good! I think your days are numbered pal!
No one wants war expect politicians
Fake media again
Were did it start 14 years ago sad just relax like enjoy your trip pray 4 peace Jesu said i am the Prince of Peace not like the gives 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😋
Russians seem way to behaved for their government, you never see them full on riot.
those russians are traitors. they should be VERRY VERY concerned about all that NATO expansion to its borders, and the military bases and nukes the USA want to deploy in ukraine. just pay attention why USA wants so much to get close to its borders. russians should mobilize and defend their country. if ukraine joins nato, russia will be invaded.
...хмм, ребята, вам лучше начать сопротивляться. Стоять вокруг всех мирно и вежливо, как вы говорите «к черту Путина или Трюдо», доставит вам неудобства. Время для мирных протестов в России давно прошло. Начинайте сопротивляться, это того стоит. Канада, вам лучше обратить внимание на это, потому что ваша диктатура не так уж далека от того, что происходит сейчас в России. Помните, что ваше канадское полицейское управление не на вашей стороне, они работают на диктатора, вам лучше проявить немного самоуважения и уволить этого ЛОХА. Или ты заслуживаешь того, чтобы Трюдо писал о рабах. Давай, Россия, Канада, скажи это трижды быстро: «Путин должен уйти, Трюдо должен уйти, Путин должен уйти, Трюдо должен уйти, Путин должен уйти, Трюдо должен уйти», черт возьми!
Police are more scum then protection within that country they should be just making sure they are not hurting themselves
The Protestors are Ukrainians not all Russian
Nice putain your own people are done with you don't blame them
Putin is a murderer. Destroy putin and his oligarchs. GOD BLESS UKRAINE. LONG LIVE UKRAINE 🙏
Propaganda war is just a piece of cake , only the involvement of the  US to help the Ukrainian would get the victory of this war
BIG respect.
His days are over death to thee infidels or salvation in christ your choice repent  repent  repent  repent  repent  repent  repent  repent  repent  repent
God bless you guys I know that you guys never want this bs we just want to live our life we already have COVID why do we need a f kin war? I was planned to go to russia when putin open the country I even learn the language! I watch alot of bald and bankrupt and making him my guide in preparing to 30 day tours in the beautiful country of Russia but this just happens shame on you Putin! Now if I can travel I would go volunteer in Ukraine instead. Some of Ukrainian artists in my community are now forced to live in the train station It was totally unacceptable they didn't do nothing to deserve this bs.
Where were all these people during 7 years of genocide of people of Donbass? Where were CNBC all these years? You see what you wanna see. I am happy that most of the Russians support Putin at such hard times
Protesters are the taxpayers and they have the right to speak out
Reminiscentt  of EDSA people piwer in the Philippines
Миротворцы...
Bubs priests should rally too. As in the Philippines
Peaceful rally is people power  a way for the police to protect co Russians as most of the protesters   are taxpayers and
That's what they get for allowing that monster to remain seated as their president
Cause the people of Russia know , the economic hardship is going to hit them hard, but  putin will still live good
It’s sad how neither population wants war, the question is, what does Russia get out of this? not ‘what does Putin’, but what does Russia?  A bloody and meaningless war waged for one man’s idea.
People of Russia, stand up to that tyrant. The world is behind you.
Peace is the only way.
These officers are a disgrace to their jobs and their country, and people. Shameful!
DEAR GOD, WE NEED YOU TO TAKE CONTROL AND END THIS WAR.  COVER THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FIGHTING AGAINST THIS.
F**king government.. I know rassian people are so friendly and Peace people.. currently I'm in Russia, all Russian people around  me are very angry with there own government.. but they are helpless, they said if they speak their families get trouble.. #peace
No to war! Ні війні! Нет войне! 🇺🇦 🙏 Pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦
Does anyone  else think that Putin is sick? Dementia or something else?  I  am heartened to see the Russian people protesting.   Please keep it up.  Do not let him intimidate you.  My thoughts and prayer are with UKRAINE and the Russian protesters.  Canada
A comparison I have been trying to avoid:  Reports coming out that thousands of Russian citizens in many cities in the country are holding demonstrations against the war in Ukraine since the very first day!❤🌹🌷How similar is that to the possibilly 95% or maybe 99% of American public which when their country is murdering hundreds of thousands of people time after time not only they don't care to show their opposition to genocides but they nonstop express their support for their troops committing horrible atrocities!😫😢😳Can't help to think about the difference!🙏(Also western Europeans as highly as they think of themselves)
Good job Russians Fight for your freedom. You are not prisoners! Don't let any poisoning, murderous, lying propaganda war criminal dictator oppress you!!!! The world is not against you. The world is against Putin!
Gg
Not that he'll listen
Screw the oligarchs anyway you can. Take away their apartments, send them home, deny their visas, etc
Remember when vaccine protests happened? These news medias didn't cover that 🤣
Now ppl get to see why cops are attacked,  just like in thecUSA, on Jan 6th. They become the henchmen for terrorizing nutcase leaders.
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." Edmund Burke
So sad, Russian Medical Teams fails to maintain 2 meters social distancing RE COVID19 restrictions and the disease will spread the virus all over the Russian people...
Russians are scared that the west is about to send them to the shadow realm
https://youtu.be/Z_s-Qk07KxA
Let's keep protesting! The people has the power
The police need to be attacked -- the police need to be more fearful of the people than the Russian dictator pig.
Good No
Avoid Lukoil stations! #BoycottRussia
Guy is right... Putin’s actions will not only bring suffering on Ukraine but upon the Russians as well.
All becaise of one mad man.
Well Maybe Putin's Family needs to show Ethic's? Great Papa he's a Killer??
Gagawin ng American na paniwalaha ng mga tao lhat ng salita nila pag pinalagan Kalat na tiroresta 😂🤣
These police wake up, you have a dictator leader who doesnt care about his people.
It's time for pootin to stop
It’s time to blow their muffin cap back blue
Gideon them from the INSIDE-OUT; YEA✊🏼
We condemn Mr. Putin action to Ukraine, and we praise the defenders of peace around the world including Russians people who loved peace.
No more belive politicians,  specially Russian  V.V.Putin!
How many more Russian people would protest if there was no risk of arrest ....MORE POWER TO THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE and more and very swift aid to Ukraine.  Best from Maine USA
B
Russians who are against the war, pls fight in whatever you can to end the bloody war!
The Russian people are great. Putin needs to go!
🥺🥺🥺 just joking 😔😔😔 it’s sad your own people it’s 😢

Respect to the people who were protesting against Putin's actions.
RUSSIAN PEOPLE YOU MUST DO SOMETHING
This is the press! These are George Soros hacks!
The Russian PEOPLE have the ONLY real power Time to dunk the BULLY
I'm Russian, and I've been crying every day since this stupid war started
Now these people will lose their jobs, quotas, and privileges in banks after serving 15 days of arrest. Protests in Russia are very dangerous
Putin needs to be taken out. If you catch my drift..
To all truckers now thats when you protest when lives are in danger America and Canada learn from this
West media bulsiht... we love putin
One man  "Putin" wants war because he wants to build back the Soviet era,. No one else wants this war. Makes one wonder  how ONE MAN can make this decision.
He's on his yaught in mara largo Florida partying
Russian People are stronger than Putin, say no tyranny, say no to war, say no to bloodshed, say no dictatorship. Ukraine People shall prevail over this evil....Power belongs to the People....away with Putin.... For Ukrainian People We stand by you....to defend your country....
Live in Fear or live Free , Fight for it Freedom!
The Russian people are fed up of violence and being isolated by the international community, they too want a better society, better living standards,  and good relationships with western Europe and the world. Their protests are very brave and show an other picture of how few Putin and his oppressive regime still have in his own country, despite all the propaganda and lies and deceit, his days are numbered ...
Let's All Smoke Weed and Live happily together
If Putin  doesn’t do this it will be the fall of Russia in the next decade
It’s not like they have polls there for public opinion
Just remember just 3 years ago you all wanted communism now this channel and viewers want Russia to stop. Wow…. I wonder if trump got another 4 years would this happen?
Yes let forget about Canada's CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS still being egregiously violated against MILLIONS of its own citizens
Brasil pela paz
That what is gonna happen when you voted for an authoritarian leader. Only you Russians who can remove that sick President of yours.
He might honestly have their support Its a country of millions and only thousands are protesting.
The United Nations is truly a worthless organization.  NATO (No Action Talk Only) just rattles their cobwebbed swords.  Biden...well, he cannot even find Ukraine on the map let alone pronounce it.  Politicos breed war and the People always suffer.  Putin is doing the exact same thing Hitler did when he invaded Poland back in 1939...and it did lead to WW2.
Don't be fooled by west reporting, Putin is loved in Russia and across the world
Putin gotta go. 😤😤😤😤😤
Putin is liar con man
Meanwhile, neocon war demands break out across America.
The globalist fascist policy of Western countries led by the USA has brought the world to the brink of cataclysm.  A world policeman who has been brandishing weapons for decades, attacking other countries at the expense of his own interests, dared to come to the Russian border.  To provoke a great Russia.  Russia is one of the few normal countries in today's world.  The satanized West and its insane quest to bring the whole world under control has brought civilization to the brink of survival.  They have been terrorizing the free world for two years now, the so-called  measures.  Abolished human rights.  Naturally untested vaccines and so-called  meds.  They do things that even Hitler would not be ashamed of.   That is why a new Nuremberg is necessary for new criminals.  And it will happen.  Punishment trials and confiscation of property for all who were part of this madness.  Because freedom has no price and lack of freedom is justification.

Many russians are not in favor of this war.Stop killing each other.GOD bless Ukranians and Russian people.

(54) 5:52-54 Perhaps many decision-makers in different countries of mankind would like to say: "We did not imprison your supporters, O Nasser Mohamed Al-Yamani, and we did not cause to them any harm " then Allah's caliph on the worlds Nasser Mohamed Al-Yamani replies to them and says: "Do you think Allah's caliph on the worlds Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohamed Al-Yamani will remove injustice from upon his supporters and that is it ?! Far is that from being the truth! I swear by Lord of the earth and heavens to remove, by the permission of Allah, the injustice of man towards his fellow man, as I make no difference between a Yemeni and Chinese, accordingly I am Allah's caliph on the worlds Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohamed Al-Yamani, command all decision-makers in mankind's governments in different countries to empty all the prisons of mankind in rural and urban areas of all prisoners by a blanket pardon from Allaah's caliph Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohamed Al-Yamani ___________ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani 08-Rajab-1443AH 09-February-2022 AD 05:56 AM (According to the official time of Mecca Mother of Towns) ___________ 📌(To read the statement in clear and coordinated writing kindly visit the official website of the Awaited Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani or search Google using the statement's title): The COVID of No Escape From Death has Arrived 2 =/mwZk
People is the power over throw Putin
the Russian Revolution of 2022 shall begin
People is the power over throw this government.
Some of  us remember Kent State so stop the hypocrisy the US authorities jailed and even killed anti Vietnam war demonstrator’s.
Hell Yeah.
Lots of pink haired freaks and antifa flags showing up to these global protests. Yeah I know who's side Im on. Let's go red white and blue if you catch my drift ;)
Actually, most Russians supported the action of Putin against Ukraine, the moment Prez of Ukraine announced during the conference in Munich a few days ago that he wanted to install a nuclear weapon on the border with Russia. 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺 But US propaganda will not tell you this. Look at the Russian polls done by independent Levada center that is sponsored by the West.
Respect to the protesters from Norway
Russian people stand up against a dictator!
It is good to see that an average Russian doesn't support this war. But I guess this dictator called Putin won't listen.
NBC, MSNBC, SUCKED. LYING AS CNN AND THE LEFTS.
putin stop (war ❌❌❌❌❌❌
Thanks to the Russian people who don't want this war.
they live in a DICTATORSHIP and still protest now that's some real balls
For those Russian Police Officers arresting peaceful protesters, go home and look your children in the eyes. Your "just following orders" mindset has ruined their future. Sadly, Russia will once again become a pariah when whatever outcome is achieved and sanctions will set Russia back decades. The Ukrainian and Russian people do not deserve this. My thoughts are with you all 🙏
It's always the average person in all countries who suffer for a relatively small amount of self important and/or rich and power hungry people. It has always been this way since the beginning of time. Millions suffer for the decisions of a few. Bless the Ukrainian and Russian counterparts of the American average Joe. 🙏
russia did what turkey did to greece!
How hillarious!   This BS report makes the news but NONE of the MASS PROTESTS in nearly every country across the globe over COV'ID mandates and lockdowns?  THE PEOPLE standing up to tyrannical governments will NOT be televised!    ABC = Enemy ABC = Traitors ABC -> Fraud,  Conspiracy to Commit Fraud, many more

Gegen das eigene Volk das ist ganz schlecht das nenn ich ein eigentor und vergest nicht sie wieder frei zu lassen wenn Putin Geschichte ist
🛑Quote From The statment Of The  Awaited Imam Mahdi Nasser Muhammad Al Yamani 🛑 ⚠️⚠️26 - 01 - 2022⚠️⚠️ O His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdul Aziz, I bear witness to Allaah and all mankind and jinns that I command you to set all my Saudi and Non-Saudi supporters from the prisons of KSA, all at once without any delay in implementing the order  Perhaps Mohammed Bin Salman would like to say: "And who are you, O Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, to issue an order to His Royal Highness Mohammed Bin Salman to give orders to release your Saudi and Non-Saudi supporters from the prisons of Saudi Arabia?" Then, Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani replies to you and says: " I am indeed Imam Mahdi, Allaah's caliph on the whole world. I swear by Allaah the Great who will achieve His purpose, if you did not obey the command of Allaah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, Allaah would do to you what He has done to your Father; thus He Sends against you His firm plan, COVID, so it strikes you down into a clinical death as it did to your father; leading to your own death!  So your highness and superiority in Earth would not benefit you and you will never find besides Allaah a helper or protector, then He makes you an example for whoever disobeys the order to obey His caliph on the whole world  Perhaps Mohammed Bin Salman would like to say: "Do you believe the rumors about the death of my father? Nay, they are just conjectures. O Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, did not you claim that you do not say about Allah conjectures that do not avail anything against the truth?" Then, Allaah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani replies to you and says: "O Mohammed Bin Salman, Allaah's caliph on the worlds is not of those who speak using expectations, predictions, or guesses and far is that from being the truth! I swear by Lord of the earth and heavens that the news from Allaah Lord of the worlds confirms the fact that Allaah has stricken down King Salman Bin Abdul Aziz with the so-called Coronavirus. Or do you think that your father was stricken down with corona due to his age and the weakness of his immune system, and you see that you are young and Allaah's firm plan cannot take you down into a clinical death until Allaah pleases then you die? Surely, there is no escape from COVID; Allaah's firm plan, so beware of the planning of Allaah the One the Overpowering!  Do not you know that whoever opposes Allaah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani has opposed Allaah? And whoever opposes Allaah and His caliph indeed Allaah is severe in Punishment. So who would save you from the severe torment of Allaah if Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani was truly Imam Mahdi; Allaah's caliph on the worlds?!  O man, I do not say I am Allaah's caliph on Yemen only but Allaah's caliph on the whole world. Would not Allaah achieve His purpose if Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani was truly the Caliph of Allaah who is chosen by Allaah Lord of the worlds? And if I were a liar it would be to my own loss and no harm shall befall you. Also, if I were truthful, Allaah would inevitably hit you with what His caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani,promised you  O man, fear Allaah and submit to Allaah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, thus Allaah would increase you in power and honor as I will not break Allaah's promise, in the clear verses of His Book the Great Quran, to whoever fears Allaah the One the Overpowering from among decision-makers, so he sought Allaah's forgiveness and worshipped Him alone no partners Has He. Allaah's has indeed ordered me to increase him in power and honor in line with the promise of Allaah in the clear verses of His Book the Great Quran in the Word of Allaah the Exalted: ‎{وَإِذْ تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكُمْ لَئِن شَكَرْتُمْ لَأَزِيدَنَّكُمْ ۖ وَلَئِن كَفَرْتُمْ إِنَّ عَذَابِي لَشَدِيدٌ ‎﴿٧﴾}  {And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed: "If you give thanks (by accepting Faith and worshipping none but Allah), I will give you more (of My Blessings), but if you are thankless (i.e. disbelievers), verily! My Punishment is indeed severe."} 14:7  So think and consider and get the plotting of the three out of your head! O Mohammed Bin Salman, What is your thought about Whom Ar-Rahman (Allaah) is with Him?! I swear by Allaah that mankind and jinns will not have power over him, and whoever denied this has tasted a punishment. And we will wait and see who is swifter in planning, the arrogant ones or Allaah? And this challenge is not out of my own accord but it is from Allaah who Knows best what is within yourselves O Mohammed Bin Salman and his soldiers. That is why Allaah has ordered me to say to Mohammed Bin Salman and his soldiers the following: (What is your thought about Whom Allaah is with Him)  Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani  23-Jumada II-1443AH 26-January-2022AD 07:07 AM (According to the official time of Mecca Mother of Towns) __________ Warning to Prince Mohammed Bin Salman https://www(dot)mahdialumma(dot)com/showthread(dot)php?p=369018#post369018  Remove the (dot) and replace it with .

Stop protesting, start riots. Only thing that will get his attention
Of course there will be not everyone in Russia supports puitn just like not all in UK support Boris and not all I American support sleepy Joe, this is perfect for anti puitn citizens to devalue putin and Try to be rid of him and possible egged on by the west ,who caused this mess in the first place ,typical American all guns blazing Vietnam, middle East, all fails and a waste of life and many trillions and like Russia, pushing and pushing nato closer and antagonistly towards Russia and deployment of nuclear weapons on European soil .not one wanted Russian to do the worst ,but just imagine if it was all round the other way ,Cuban missle crisis, did not like that did they Russia on there doorstep ,thankfully it ended well ,humans are stupid and the sad thing is ,seems to be the politicians in charge that cause mess around the world ,funny how puitn is this bad man and American has done worse and all is forgot ,even the execution by rope of saddam .weapons of mass destruction, was a lie .many tens of thousands dead if not hundreds, makes putin seem nice .
People care more about navalny than ukraine. Our hearts go out to russian soldiers.
The world is proud for thousands and thousands of Russian citizens going out to their streets to protest and demonstrate against Putin and his regime. There is hope for Russian to have a better future if they will continue to unite and go out of their streets and continue their street protest and demonstrations and filling their streets of thousands and thousands more of Russians. Learn from history that change starts from its people united. Don’t Russians want to be like Germany, Poland, Hungary, even Ukraine of a progressive and free nation. In time If Russians unite and persevere and will no back step no matter what .. change they will get it., better future will await their children.
What u will call  the  invasions by USA in  Afghanistan?
O human populations, the severe corona is a firm plan from Allaah who has Sent it to whoever disobeys the orders of Allaah generally, to submit and obey the command of His caliph on the worlds Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. Verily, whoever disobeys my order give him tidings of clinical death through a plan from He who has Appointed me His caliph on the worlds (Allah my Lord and your Lord) and there is no escape! Who is it that is coequal to Allah Lord of the worlds Glorified and Highly Exalted is He ?! Omicron would accept the truce of whoever obeys Allah and His caliph; for peace is best. But if you refused, soon a lot of nations will find themselves without presidents nor governments, and I will not allow any chaos between nations when they have no governments, as omicron will strike down whoever wants to cause corruption in the land by taking away people's money and business or violate their sanctities, verily omicron will knock him down immediately and will severely strike at every finger-joint of him to keep people's security after (Allaah) annihilates those who refused and acted arrogantly towards the command of Allaah the One the Overpowering to obey His caliph (as what has passed is not but mere warning and alarm of widespread evil) and he will never find anyone to protect him from the torment of Allaah's firm plan. How many times did I advise decision-makers at day and night to be servants of Allaah and to worship Allaah alone no partners with Him so they obey the command of Allaah's caliph on the worlds (who is Allaah's servant like them) so they submit to the command of Allaah's caliph on the worlds Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani O Xi Jinping, the Chinese President, I swear by Him who has appointed me as His caliph; that is Allaah who you deny Him (my Lord and your Lord) if you did not release all Muslims inside the prisons of China along with all prisoners in general in the Chinese prisons, the firm plan of Allah, COVID, will strike you down along with all wrongdoers among your soldiers, like it (COVID) did to Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud O Xi Jinping, Bin Salman did not break his appointment out of his own accord but COVID; the firm plan of Allah has stricken him down into a clinical death like I had promised him before. And I have promised you with it, O Xi Jinping, along with those of your like in the worlds Go and ponder upon: (The Series of Statements About the Blood Gnat), and whoever wants to understand the news let him read it from the beginning to the end and that is for you to know that Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani truly knows from Allah that which you do not know, and those who understand and think know that Allaah has truly Appointed him His caliph on the whole world  certainty that Allaah will achieve His purpose even if He had to annihilate half of mankind who reached their rectitude so that they submit to Allaah's caliph and servant Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. So let each human flee to Ar-Rahman (Arabic: the Most Gracious) my Lord and your Lord; Allaah who there is no god except Him, my Lord and your Lord, and Lord of the heavens and earth and what is between them and Lord of the Great Throne. Also, know that Allaah Forgives all sins without exception; He is indeed the All-Forgiving the Most Merciful. And turn to Allaah in repentance from the great sins, injustice, and gross indecencies and flee from Allaah to Him I am indeed from Him to you a manifest warner and the decision neither belongs to me nor you. Know that Everything to do with this affair is in Allaah's hands and all matters return to Allaah (in decision) who Knows the treachery of the eyes and what chests conceal. Indeed Allaah is Capable of everything, and know that all things and all which has hit you are a determined decree in the Book Inscribed How many times did I warn you that you cannot resist Allaah's cosmic and covidious war, but you acted arrogantly! And my call has not increased wrongdoers among you except in denial of Allaah Lord of the worlds, and you neglected Allaah as if He is not the One behind the cosmic war, the so-called climatic, aerial, nautical, and terrestrial disasters! But they are due to the approach of the planet of torment (Saqar), and I have warned you of severe punishment from Allaah but you refused as if He is not the One behind His cosmic war and the war of His covidious soldiers! Glorified and highly Exalted is He above what you associate with Him! If Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani is truly Allaah's caliph on the whole world, know that Allaah will achieve His purpose and know that He is Capable of everything Also, How many times did I warn you that you must worship Allaah my Lord and your Lord with insight (the Quran) from Allaah Lord of the worlds and that you must fear His torment through the piety of your hearts out of fear of Allaah the One, Exalted is He! He is indeed Worthy to be feared, and Worthy to forgive, but you feel secure against the plan of Allaah and only the losers feel secure against Allaah’s plan And I have already written to you a healing prayer for people in general in a statement on 26th of Ramadan 1441AH (19-05-2020AD), titled: Corona Virus And The Decisive Statement That Is Not To Be Taken for Amusement So read the whole prayer in it in the evening and in the morning, and know that therein is healing for what is in the chests. It also has the complete and conclusive solution for what you are experiencing of Allaah's cosmic and covidious war. O Allaah I have delivered so be my Witness and if you were arrogant towards this prayer, why should I grieve for people who are arrogant and wrongdoers?! Verily, judgment belongs to Allaah the Swiftest in account and planning; indeed He is the best of Judges Peace be upon the messengers and praise be to Allaah Lord of the worlds Allaah's caliph and servant Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani ___________ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani 08-Rajab-1443AH 09-February-2022 AD 05:56 AM (According to the official time of Mecca Mother of Towns) ___________ 📌(To read the statement in clear and coordinated writing kindly visit the official website of the Awaited Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani or search Google using the statement's title): The COVID of No Escape From Death has Arrived 3 #TruthSeekerIsNeverBored   w£9x57  🍃🍃🍃

This is ridiculous. The civilian Russians have the numbers!!! Overthrow the police, overthrow the government!! Dont just stand there & protest and be easily taken away in cuffs. STEP UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL!!
Ever since WW2 ended, no one attack Russia. The only one that attack Russia in WW2 was Hitler. Even when USSR collapse, no country was invading Russia. Invading Ukraine for the sake of Russia's security is a stupid excuse. Fking KGB
"Rejected their demands" - to NOT attack an innocent country? To NOT be Putins slaves, just because he feels like it!?? F YOU PUTIN!
Make love not war!
This is absolute propaganda.
Hopefully Russia uncovers the dirty dealing done between the US government an the bidens all done in Ukraine. All the dirty money all the secrets all of it. Anyone who believes anything they say is a useful fool.
"every single Russ citizen is against the war, we're not just saying that bc WE'RE against it , people who disagree with us don't exist"
THE NEW HITELR AND WOOPI SUPPORTS HIM
Who cares
What's the point of supporting Jewkraine?
Да здравствует "Russia Fasha"!😀
Praying for Ukraine . It is time for the world to come together as one and get rid of putin and all like him . He has given the world the opportunity and the world should respond with force .
Ukraine needs to offer a billion dollars for putins head
Go find puten go find puten and his dummies and put them in jail for killing innocent humans....
The bravery of these people points out the cowardice and lack of patriotism of Fox and Trump. The Russian people are able to see injustice more clearly than the unpatriotic talking heads at Fox. They are supporting a killer who, despite being the dregs of humanity, they seem to admire. They risk nothing and prejudice their listeners against our form of government. They should be banned from military bases. Their salaries have become blood money earned off the backs of Russian nationals protesting an unprovoked war as well as Ukranians whose wish to self govern is being threatened by an outside intruder. was unwanted and uninvited.
To live the lifestyle they are accustomed to, the Russians took over nearby resources and land.  Just how it works with every war.
ALL governments trying to control ALL citizens ! FOLLOW the dirty money trail !!! Their next step is to REMOVE fiat currency from our wallets globally !!!! EVERYONE MUST DO AS CENTRAL BANKS AND GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING ! Stockpiling gold !!!! BUY PHYSICAL SILVER BULLION AND GOLD BULLION!!!!!! This is EVERYONE’s last piece of leverage !!! They control our money - we ALL BECOME SUBJECTS !!!!!
This is a very emotional time for humankind, death has arrived on 🌎
Don't take your rights for granted. Don't vote them away. People in other countries don't have a bill of rights like we do.
🌏❤️we love our planet.
U need trucks
Feels like no one wants this except Putin.
Looks like Canada
He needs to be careful before he ends up like the Czars.
In the name of Jesus thank you. We don't need war!!! We need to heal are nations from this virus not war.
Putin will have to answer to GOD at the end for this act.
This is way too much history  Bottom line if America had a real leader this wouldn’t be happening but instead we received a evil worthless thief overnight who rigged and stole our election bc of power and greed.  We can fight in a war in Afghanistan for years but we won’t help the Ukrainian people 🤦🏻‍♂️ F*ck the Demoncrats 👹
We see the same Jan 6 in capitol Hill. The national guard acting violence against innocent protestors.  Praying for Ukraine people!
Thank you so much for your bravery! спасибо большое! NO TO WAR! Solidarity with all anti-war protestors in Russia from Austria!
Gotta give russia credit their cops handle white same what usa handles blacks The hippocracy of us media
Salute to all the brave Russian who stand up protest against the war. We are witnessing the cruelty and oppression of freedom under Putin's regime. 🙏 for their safety
People power on Russia   remove on President place  and after he romoving power  on jail with other
Bring out the no limit soldier
I think the oligarch are getting fed up by now. Thrown out from their fancy London adresses, USD 100 billion in siezed assets by EU, superyachts borded and seized. No visas to the carribean, See where this is going, dont bet on a dead horse!
Disbanding NATO will end war.  But then how can tax funding NATO be used to profit businesses?  I cant think of a better way to get around insider trading, can you?
Canada?
It shows old men and their politics care about war and citizens have to suffer their actions
ধিক্কার জানাই রাশিয়া ও পুতিন কে Condemn Russia and Putin🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Although the Russian elections a most likely fixed, the Russian people should try to vote out Putin and replace him with someone who conscious of the people's will and their freedom of choice and humanity rather than electing someone who is more power hungry and a dictator like Putin. I would suspect that there are more Russians who would rather have their freedoms than there are who like to be told what they can and can't do. No matter, if the people work together to get what they want, they can make it happen.
Just like trudeau
All nato and Eu and Un nations that have banks holding Oligarch Money should be seized and the pipeline running from Germany giving them gas cut odd!
Дякую за Україну🇺🇦✌️
Peace not war . Down putin.
Will US go to war with Russia https://youtu.be/gb31oWrG4DM
respect to those russian protesters
What putin said about his people support  is A LIE...
These Russian protesters are braver than their tyrant of a President could ever dream of being
Imagine thinking protesting is going to do anything in Russia, the people obviously dont matter to Putin.
Don’t worry Putin will do the same as Trudeau and freeze accounts and use brute force on peaceful protestors.
I can't stand the legacy news. There isn't really any partisan bias here but I can feel myself getting dumber with the presentation of this information. Filled with hyperbole, subtle misdirection, Western-centrism. Just show these people protesting and shut up for the most part. You offer nothing as TEEVEE "journalists."
Finally for the first time ever russian people have some sense in them
Respect to the Protesters 🙌
Oh boy it's '69 all over again!
Footage from Ottawa
This is most likely propaganda.
Says a lot. There are serious consequences for protesting in russia....
Message of General Secretary of UN to Putin. War Russia and Ukraine: https://youtu.be/eSvPEPDAWOM
Stop this war!!!! Biden and germany should do something and stop it! what is wrong with you people?
Those russian civilians have more hearts than Putin's     Wait... does Putim even have a heart?
Россия наведет порядок. Нацизму нет! Восемь лет шли переговоры, воду в ступе мололи, люди друг друга убивали. Надо положить нацизму украинскому конец.
Ukraine nazi government first and don’t forget German and Canadian Bazi governments.
Anti war peoples are idiots. There is no peace without war.
Military police now the enemy of the public ?
Putin is pure evil can someone please stop him
"Every Russian" - I'm not sure that's true
Yes
#НетВойне #NoWar 🇷🇺❤🇺🇦
It's nice to see Shep Smith employed by a reputable company. 🇺🇦
Looks like a “fringe minority” to me
2nd russian revolution??
Protesters must fight back!

Thank u Russian bravehearts  for standing up against mad maniac Putin
thats what happened when u put maho lgbtq on top.... #makelovenotwar#rainbowpeace  🤣🤣🤣🤣
Organizers of that are from west maybe , they must be detained and investigated, also this western media let them go out ,they created chaos
So brave.. My prayers for the innocent.. Also, remember Palestine, which is occupied since 1948.
Knpa sodara kita Palestine dijajah dari dulu bahakan menelan ribuan jutaan korban jiwa tetapi pda bayak yg diam terutama negara barat,bahkn Palestine tidak meminta bantuan
cpaciba, otchen lublu vam, Racia bez poutina. Mir e lubof!!
Looks like Chinada but 1000 times worse, the Russian people are brave to stand up against the vile leader. 🇺🇦 ❤
What the Russian people can do about stopping the war is go on strike. Bring Russia's war machine to a grinding halt. No supplies, No transport, No fuel will soon bring your soldiers home and save hundreds of thousands of innocent lives.
Wow, millions of Russians are protesting. Looks like out of the 150 million people, over 80%  are marching here. Good video.
ABOUT TIME !!!
Ukraine & Russia are not the only countries afflicted. This has collapsed the U.S stock market.   A collapse is considered proper term when more than a standard of deviation changes the numeric values across majority of stock prices. Well, most stocks are down over 40% or larger from just 3 months prior.   Many people in the U.S are battling a diminished retirement or savings fund combined with increased housing expenses by more than 90% standard mortgages.  That’s insane —-
People of Russia must people power they can remove EVIL PUTIN down to power no matter bloodshed wil spill Putin cant be president of people will fight against this Hitlers son Putin
Russian people are doing good 👍 and thanks for demonstrating Anti War. Please keep in up more.
Where are the Russian lives matter weirdos?
Salute for rusian poeple
These people are hope for the future of Russia. Thank you.
I admire these brave Russians.
God bless Ukrainians. Unrightteous Cruel aggressive invaders shall be defeated! Putin is a brutal criminal!
My deep respect to all protesters. ❤ But given the US-Russia tussle and the way Ukraine did decisive move it escalated the crisis and war was inevitable.
We see you! You are brave and strong! You are the future! Greetings from Germany...
Russians are not Putin, keep fighting Russians
What about Syria and iraq. Why they didn't protest that time?
Thank you Thank you Thank you people for standing up to this dictator , he is been dictating for too long
NATO want expand market to ukraine. Only one solution is just respect the balance power. for the nations to make peace in this early war. Nuclear radiation takes 11,000 years to disappear from the earth's surface. scientific evidence. thanks
Arrest Putin and not the innocent Russian people
Уважаемы иностранные агенты, прошу вас вернуть всех граждан и аннулировать визы всем русским и украинским гражданам. Люди они хорошие, но должны жить и защищать свою родину, Байден помоги.
If only these uneducated rejects knew what was really going on
the west has the biggest advantage that Russia doesn't have ... It's the media narrative.
They have their own rights
If all of us whe whole world koin forces, Putin will never win! Watching this right now, im willing to die for my country
Russia is just China the second.
Why are they arresting them. Is the protest peaceful? If so why arrest them? Smh. So sad.. they are also destroying their own people.
Respect to citizen of Russia ✊🏾‼️‼️
Bless these protestors. We HEAR YOU AND WE SEE YOU!!! Prayers to everyone suffering in Ukraine and all protesting in Russia.
They protseted against USA in Afghanistan what did it change We protested when Israel was Bombing Palestinian people did it make any change All the Leaders now knows that Protest is a part of the Battle so they prepare for it too and it rearly change anything
Get people  around the world to protest against Russian invasion at all Russia's embassies  can work immediately  Instead of such non-working nonsensical sanctions
stop putin
That quite surprises me. It’ll be hard to maintain this without the backing of the people. A reason for hope?
Putin is the new Hitler
MATT DAMON
Time to get rid of Tsar Putin .
Crazy police, how could they stomp on those people.
Innocent blood on everyone’s hands. I really blame Zelensky tbh.
Thankyou to anyone who protested and risked being arrested! You showed the world that the Russian people have heart! Putin is the only criminal here.
BURN RUSSIA
A man who doesnt listen to his people doesnt have any right to be called a leader! Putin needs to be reminded that he is after all a human being and those people who gets arrested for fighting what is right and just are HIS people not his pawn for economic stability and HIS power!
Wow, this actually warmed my heart that people genuinely are tired of war.  As a world we don’t want it… we know how it ends.  Stay strong.
This story needs to be spread. So many here in the us believe they are all on the same side
RESPECT !
There is nothing we can do to stop the cruel people who run this world from spreading war destruction chaos death hate division... it's just what they do on this messed up planet. Greed power control money ego hatred..a lack of love for your fellow man...selfishness pride envy etc etc this is what causes war and needless death and suffering.  If you read the Bible you'll find out we are all born with a sin nature into this world and really all these traits are in all of us none excluded.  So no we can't change how this world is run sadly.  We can change ourselves though..our hearts minds attitudes lifestyles thoughts actions intentions.  We can choose good love kindness forgiveness compassion empathy sympathy patience self control in our daily interactions with others. We can reach out and positively impact this world one person at a time!  Focus on what you can do not on what the corrupt selfish rulers of this earth will always do and I'm not referring to one particular ruler who's getting all the world's attention right now.   God bless!❤
The Russian people are starting to realize their dim reality. I love the Russian culture honestly. But they went from Slavs to Slaves. A lot of them are starting to realize this now.
END WAR!!!!!!!
BRAVE Russians protesting against this!
dont care i want a war
Be careful not to arrest my mail order bride ! Thanks
Godbless this ppl trying to stop war
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
I think we need to protest Joe Biden  incompetence too.
Strong people standing against tyranny. Canada and our Truckers stand in prayer with you crying out to God to free us from dictators everywhere.
Only putin wants a war even his official are against with him
This is reassuring
Did not last long
Lol like Putin gives af
The police officers that are dragging away war protesters will soon be on the chopping block. When you say “i was just doing my job” I promise no one will feel sympathy for you
PUT THEM ALL IN PRISON! DONT LET UK AND USA  LIBERALISM SPREAD!
Putin is a murdering rogue kleptocrat; he has shown the world to be an incompetent wealthy spoiled brat! There was never any intention ever, to invade Russia. Putin is committing a war crime! His personal army is to protect his own ridiculous childish Tzar lifestyle. There is no grain of respect for this cheap low criminal like Putin. He has unfolded to Russians and the world that the only real threat to Russia is Putin and Putin only who build himself a private billion-dollar fortress with a nuclear hideaway and has billions hidden away from the Russians and surely, they won’t put up any longer with this type of behavior neither that of his oligarchs nor the Russian Mob. …Putin’s time is up…finished…the end after this war, period, Pepsee in support of World Peace.
That war must not be that bad…if u have time to protest…..instead of finding somewhere safe to be….
New Bolshevik will dethrone the new Ceasar or tsar of Russia just like the tsar Romanov..
Putin needs to be overthrow
not Russians they are Ukrainians
nobody wants war!
Why do ordinary citizens put up with this garbage. Ordinary citizens are the individuals who are paying the taxes to fund these military forces why should any ordinary individual continue to pay taxes to fund the very enforcers who prevent them from exercising their Democratic rights. Particularly if these protesters are not interfering with any other operations of the community
It's time for the Russian people to take down Putin! It's time the Russian people stand up to him as the men on Snake Island did!
Remember! Us war with Iran, Iraq and Libya etc. They called it liberation of democracy. Not invasions...
...you can count on lamestream to paint a picture their way...
...and 60 % of canadians agree with turdeau....
Pray for all
Its craziness they have family and friends in Ukraine and look at that Russian people dont agree on War either.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TQsZIBHw2io Thousands Of Georgians Protest Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine
God bless all the people in Russia who are standing up for peace, your bravery shows the world that you do not want this war. I am so proud of all of you. May you all remain safe.
Looks JUST like American cops dragging protesters in America in 2020 and 2021. Or kicking 80 year old men for no reason. Good job leading by example America! 👏🏼
WOW.
Mad respect for the people brave enough to protest the war
Preparing for months lol? The moment after annexing crimea and then Ukraine shut off the fresh water for farmers.... I'm pretty sure this was the moment they started preparing.
Good People!💖💖😘
Putin dont respect even his own people .
[EVERYONE] IGNORE ANY [BOT OR TROLL] WHERE YOU SEE THEY JUST WANT ATTENTION.
+835 on the dow, +221 on the nasdaq., +97 snp. proof that wall street agrees with me that ukraine is worthless and russia's back will soon break under biden's crusing economic sanctions
may love & peace prevail  not war! however  pooten must toppled by his peaple by making noise rally anti-war protest in the city of moskova
No war
No more war# Hands off The Ukraine# Peace love and freedom# USA citizens do not want# war # God will hear our cries for peace! Impeach Joe Biden# Peace and prayers
US mainstream media : Americans protesting war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and occupation of Palestine are hypocrites and traitors.  US mainstream media : Russians protesting Putin's invasion of Ukraine are heroes and idealists.   Spot the double standard !
support your government, your president have a big power, don't break the spirit of "Putin" to expand his territory, be yourself, don't be weak, go forward for your country.....
He is not heroes again. Satan like war.
All Russian citizen was banned coz of Putin
"As expected and true to historical patterns, Police in riot gear crack down on ... protestors and drag the demonstrators away in cuffs". Hmmm sounds like another country lol.
Change Putin. Putin is a Satan
Tin soldiers and Putin's coming We're finally on our own Four dead in Moscow.
As this video shows those are terrible things being done by the Canadian government and law enforcement to the Canadian truck drivers and there families !!! Oh wait, did I just read they were Russian government and law enforcement  beating and arresting Russian families???  Putin and Trudeau  are two peas in a pod!
I can't believe that all the cops are being manipulated and turned against their own people who are protesting in peace. You should support them not throw them beaten into the cells . The Russian police show cowardice. You should fight for freedom. No war! No violence
Our hearts are with you, Ukrainian defenders and Russian protesters.  Stay strong.  And yes, we do very much wish we the small people could do more to help you right now.
putin = hitler 2.0
Thank you people of Russia for having clear and working sight. I know some of you still don't but atleast I can commend those I see here and who share the same sentiment.
It might be time for another revolution. But they will need to number in the hundreds of thousands.
These idiots Russian citizens who protest are protest against their own protection. If Putin don’t protect Russia now when in the near future Ukraine join NATO than Russia is finish! The west has history of illegal invasion of weaker nation like those in the Middle East. Russia must stay strong and stand tall against the criminal war crimes government from the west.
Better watch out Putin the Russian people are particularly known for revolution.
Its about time. When living under a dictators rule, his expanded powers and term limit to 2036. When videos talk about what not to do in Russia, the tops are don't smile to much and talk bad about Putin, thats like a sharia law type apostasy shithole. Don't smile at women or to much?
I just dont know what to say, cant put it in words...
These are the real heroes of the war
this is how police obey their FUHRER in Russia, just like they did not act when the fascist pig TRUMP told his followers to go to the parliament! Ussr and the us are similar countries where dictators think they can get away with everything thats in their sick mind
Protest in Russia is scary if they arrest you ..you might not see the day of light
Prayers for the same Russian people!
Falun Gong practitioners in Switzerland held an event in front of Palais Wilson, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, on July 15, 2021, five days before the 22nd anniversary of the onset of the persecution of this ancient spiritual and meditation practice in China.  Andrés Allemand Smaller, a reporter of Tribune de Genève, the largest regional daily newspaperreported on the event.   Screenshot of the Tribune de Genève report of forced organ harvesting in China  In the article titled “China Continues to Forcibly Remove Organs from Practitioners of Falun Gong,” it said that year after year, Falun Gong practitioners persisted in coming there, condemning the persecution that started on July 20, 1999.  May Bakhtiar, a Switzerland Falun Gong practitioner representative, told Smaller that it’s Jiang Zemin, the former chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, who decided to eradicate Falun Gong, which he thought became too popular in China, as the number of practitioners was estimated to be higher than the Communist Party members. Falun Gong was also practiced by some high-ranking government officials. Since then, the persecution has been ongoing. Millions of practitioners have been detained, tortured, brainwashed or persecuted to death. Many of them also became the victims of forced organ harvesting.
RUSSIA UNDER PUTIN = POWER USA UNDER BIDEN = WEAKNESS
Free Ukraine..
Russia will be the new world power. Biden is a wuss and the soiboi democrats who voted for him. Biden has financial connections to Ukraine.
Russia turned into Canada... terrible to watch.
Putin Is the 🤘
I hope the people take over and Russia can become a democracy.
All the Russians!,You need bring down Putin! Make Revolution!
Reminds me of canada
Putin just wants to play with his new toys. Nobody wants this to happen 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Putin is real president
This is unprecedented since the fall of the USSR. Not something our American oligarchs (like the Koch brothers) want to see. God, protesting Putin's actions takes real courage. This is the land of gulags.
So the Rothschilds friendly MSM are now on the side of peaceful protesters. But when it's against a Globalist Justin Trudeau. It's all about protecting him and attacking the people.  SICK SICK PEOPLE!!
Listen, most people no matter where they live know that war is generally over resources. The whole concept of war is infantile and and very low brain thinking in today's world.  These leaders along with  war profiteers  should be swept into the dustbin of history.    Wars are big business. In the end, it won't matter who is right, or wrong. The only thing that will matter is who is left.
People of Russia act now don't waste your time don't support Putin stop Putin and his army and bomb that many peace loving people are killed he is a war Frick criminal
Putin is the Russian Trump.
Would love to see the police join the protesting!

The hate in V.Putin's mind/heart is bigger than his reason!😒😒
Everyone upset about russia, bring up the chinese committing genocide and nothing.
Now we want to praise protesters after watching protesters in canada get beat and arrested? Idiots everywhere.
Such a backward country. We in Australia 🇦🇺. Stand strong with Eukeraine. Kick the IVANS out of your own country. They will not stop at the Eukeraine if successful, going to keep pushing. Send a team in, get rid of the rubbish.
You guys are in a communist country and your leader doesn't care you really think he is going to listen to your protests? Putin doesn't care never has never will. Hess just desperate child.
We are all sinners and we have all fell short of our sins. Our sins will cost us our souls, for the wages of sin is death. There is GREAT NEWS. Our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried, and rose on the third day to save you from the destruction of your sins. For sins yields to death, without believing in the gospel, accepting Jesus into your hearts, building a personal and deep relationship with him, repenting and turning away from your sins, your souls will not enter into Heaven. Your souls will be casted into hell for eternity. Jesus is returning soon, but time is severly short. This world and what it has to offer is fleeting away as I type this, however the word of God stands forever. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He loves you and thought about you since the beginning of creation, and every moment that lead up to him on the crucifixion on the cross. Accept him now. God Bless you.💛
Operation Valkyrie 2.0
Putin is the new era of Hitler!!!
ALL THE PRESS IN RUSSIA  says to population that Ukraine is atacking  Russia! that`s why russia invade Ukraine! Be careful!
Just like Canada
Literally ALL over the world...the people are in the streets protesting AGAINST what their governments are doing!!! Rise up and fight, people! It has become clear as day that the governments of the world are going against what the PEOPLE truly want! We outnumber these jackasses 10 to 1! The globalists are going against the people, doing whatever they personally want to do, whatever their personal agenda is, and that means a tiny amount of people are controlling the entire population humanity. War is not what the people want, nor do they want deadly "vaccines," lockdowns, and social credit systems. Looks like worldwide revolutions are in order!
With all do respect PRAYER TO JESUS IS WHAT WILL WORK
https://youtu.be/QpHwzUSnyZk viva Ucrania
This is sad crazier even watching it
Every protestor there is saving a life in Ukraine and Russia
This cowardly act lies on Putin's hands as a sadistic war criminal! He's on a path that will destroy any hope left for the Russian people.
Traitors...
Russian citizens weren't being bombed by the Anglo-Saxon's regime for the last 8 years.
So proud of them because i can’t imagine how scary it must be. Prayers for the Ukrainian and Russians, as well as the other countries that are and will be affected by this. Godspeed
We tried, but we're scared. Torture in prison is our punishment.
now do Hong Kong
Our hearts are with you, Ukrainian defenders and Russian protesters.  Stay strong.  And yes, we do very much wish we the small people could do more to help you right now.
I truly believe Russians are the only one who can stop this. The NATO will not help Ukraine with military, cause‘ this would guide to world war. Ukraine is fighting, but they NEED support- real support. The Russians are the ones who have the powers to stop this! Putin is nothing when you don’t follow him blindly. Please fight🙏🏻🙏🏻 may god bless and protect your souls!
Where was the respect for those protesting against the vaccine mandates?!
Being arrested for protesting tends to only make people more firm believers that they are right, so I think that people who protested will become even more fiercly anti putin
We are on the way to an inevitable fork in the road: a restructured Russia, or WWIII. There aren't other options
Where are the sanctions against the U.S for Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya? Time to stop believing the warmongering imperialists.
Brave Brave Russian  🇷🇺 People 🙏  Freedom to all
This is heartbreaking to see these arrests. This is why it is so important to stay aware of the power that our governments yield. Wars reported on social media aren’t more gruesome just more noticeable by the world. May god bring peace to all!
We didn't lie, Putin DID, thankyou Russian people.
I hope the Russian people will unite together and decide firmly on new leadership.
Fk Putin and J.Turdo.FJB FKH.
As shocked as people are to see protestors grabbed by cops and taken away to who knows where, remember that just two years ago our police were doing the same.
Unfortunately our Western Governments are so corrupted by Russian money they darent say anything
Ottawa police share the truth on the division (created by the media and Trudeau) about the protests in the link provided https://youtu.be/ndvDAJLWFt4
Stand strong. Стой крепко. Стій міцно. Stāviet stipri. Моцна стаяць. Bądź silny. Stai puternic. Állj erősen.
Wag the dog
What about our ARTILLERY n the TALIBAN ? Can we peacefully borrow them back....
Brave People’s protesting against Putins war.
Who think he has a green screen behind him
just as you are arresting anti vaccine protesters...... preach peace bro
Same thing the u.s does when it's people protest against their government, no diferent. Here is what Americans say about this, you don't like it leave the country...
What is wrong with THE POLICE around the globe?!?! Stop blindly following orders like machines! What are you, puppets? Mindless, emotionless and with no own will?!?!
Fake News Propaganda. Trump Won.
Looks like Canada a few days ago
To stop this now Russians must turn against putin he is a terrorist there is no place in this world for fools like putin he simply has to die to bring peace back
Stop Putin's war
I agree with putin. He made a good power move hes taking care of Ukraine before it becomes a threat to Russia.
I’m glad Putin does not have the support of his people. If he did this would resemble WWII and the Nazi party exactly where all of Germany was with Hitler and his regime.
Putin es un asesino frio y sanguinario...ha sacrificado al pueblo ruso y en este momento asesina un país que quiere vivir en sus propias reglas.
proud of the brave russians protesting
HOPE IN LOVE 💙🙏🕊💙 Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved.  Saved from the punishment of sin.

why didn’t these people care about Russian national safety? I really don’t get it
Whether it's coming from the U.S. or Russia, imperialism is never good, I stand with the brave Russian citizens protesting the regime.
Peace and love . Defend your country but not invade other country's for not reasen.  Go on Russian good people . Don't let the diktator putin to start WW3
Putin : i will arest you if you protest me.  Rusian people : so you must arrest more than half of people in this country. Putin : wait thats illegal. Rusian people : i missed the part whre thats my problem.
It's weird that Fox News - your most trusted source for information - Isn't spending much time reporting on this. I guess they don't want to upset Trump nor Putin...
United States  acting like they don't have blood on their hands. All the protest in the 1960's, and war still went on.
1:20 Did they had to arrest the balloons too?
Minorities, 90% of Russians support Putin.
Full speach of Putin without the Lies of the media https://youtu.be/1qS6J-WbTD8
Oh sure you’ll report accurately on Russian protests. These MSNBC stations are all a joke.
Will this make Russia great again?

Does anyone remember Germany sending woman sniper's into the dombass region to practice shooting Russian men.
Putin's trying to end a war and a genocide against ethnic Russians that has gone on for 8 years.  I suppose the neonatzies running Ukraine appreciate the protesters supporting the nazi's.  These protesters need to educate themselves about whom they support.  These nazi's could someday feast on the souls of your children.  Putin seems determined to denazi Ukraine.
After you remove Putin (also includes his sympathizers) from Russia, also purge the KGB's remnants from the earth.
Now if they would only protest for their own democracy. Their own choice!
Probably George soros. Com protesters....free bricks.
Vladimir Putin is Hitler Reincarnated.
Thats all?? One day protest???
America and its allies need to start launching cyber attacks against Russia to distablize it, while also arming Ukraine, and setting up insurgencies within Russia. It's past time for Russia and the world be rid of Putin. Every democratic government should be doing everything possible to end the assault on Ukraine by promoting and supporting revolution in Russia. If nukes make it so we can't attack from without, we need to ensure that we can end Putin's reign of terror from within.
May god help all of them and don't make Ukraine history .
2 Chronicles 7:14 if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.
I believe Putin must soon go, or be removed. A democratic constitution without a powerful head of state, with power in the hands of government and parliament, and a just symbolic hed of state, for example Maria Vladimirovna Romanov as a symbolic monarch, and peace, could I believe benefit Russia. (In my country, Sweden, we have such a democratic constitution, and the king as a symbolic head of state. GO Russian monarchists! I say GO this sad night!
Dude getting carried like a duffle bag
The Russian military and people need to oust that mad man from power
John 3:16 ESV  “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
This happened in US with other wars.. this is common in war time nothing new for any nation. Report some real news I’m sure the protesters aren’t even 1% of the population
A few hundred people are not "his people". they are peace hippies. Every city  has them. It isn't as bad as Trudeau's Canada, he set the police armed with rubber bullets, pepper spray, and batons, horses and riot police in against peaceful Canadian protestors. I'm more worried about Canadians under the Trudeau regime than Putin's people.
Putin has prepared his own grave.
Acts 2:17-21  “‘And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,     and your young men shall see visions,     and your old men shall dream dreams; 18 even on my male servants and female servants     in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. 19 And I will show wonders in the heavens above     and signs on the earth below,     blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke; 20 the sun shall be turned to darkness     and the moon to blood,     before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day. 21 And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.’
Acts 2:17-21  “‘And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,     and your young men shall see visions,     and your old men shall dream dreams; 18 even on my male servants and female servants     in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. 19 And I will show wonders in the heavens above     and signs on the earth below,     blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke; 20 the sun shall be turned to darkness     and the moon to blood,     before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day. 21 And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.’
I pray to the universe that the people of Russia that are protesting are successful
We are living in very scary times, any loss of life or suffering is horrible and all of this over Putins ego and desire for power makes it so much worse. I've seen people trying to say things like "it's okay, that land was part of Soviet Russia anyway" as if that justifies the unnecessary suffering this is going to cause. So many people seem to think this is just a game or something. Hoping for the safety and wellbeing of all of those affected.
This Russian heros are the ones that can better avoid a 3d world war.  Please Russian people, together you can make it happen!!!
It’s funny cause the US  would do the same exact thing!! Arresting their citizens if we defied the war!
NET Voine!!!!!     "No"  to war!    Never ever wars on this planet!   Ukraine people, we are with you!
Saw them being arrested - eerie reminder of Comrade Turdeau's treatment of Canadian protestors who oppose his government!
Modern day heroes standing up to a tyrant in defense of the country he is forcing them to attack.  The history books will remember their bravery, they may be the ones to stop ww3.
👏🏽👏🏽
Well at least  the Ukraine people are having to fight the Russians.  Our greatest enemy is sitting in the lap of our own country!!
Huf at last the people of russia is more far sighted of the consequences of war than their respected president our dear "PUTIN" and that makes me really happy🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂 a real salute to citizen of 🇷🇺 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
ALL Russians should be against Putin he is a murderer.
1:20 They arrested the balloons :(
Canada Canada Canada
Canada Canada Canada
Canada Canada Canada
Although there are many signs that this is gonna get a lot worse before it improves, it still gives me hope that people around the world today have a better understanding of how war is hell, period.
you guys have lyes non stop for 6 years, why should we believe you know?
They're always complaining about something.
USA: Appreciate the 1st Amendment which is protected by the 2nd Amendment!
You are the real power. Not your government. Use it.
Prayers to Ukraine and Russian people 🙏
That evil dictator should be remove from office before it's to late,to the Russian people my respect and admiration to all of you fighting this tyrant the world is with you our prayers and god blessed 🙏❤🇵🇭
who's gonna denazify russia
It takes balls to publicly protest against Putin. Thank you to all of these people protesting in Russia
Maybe it's time for a REVOLUTION and say goodbye to the COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT
Normal people everywhere prefer peace.  It is the sociopaths that grind the bloody ruts into human history.
Where's that respect videos guy when you need him?...
They are unarmed protestor... Let be heard.. They are hurting right now.
Those are not Putin's people, those are Western puppets who received a memo to go out and protest in the streets. Every nation has those, and they're often cheap to buy.
For every 1 anti Putin protester there are 5 pro.
Pretty much they on their own. Everyone got their own problems
We depend on you Russian  people to stop this war , keep protesting , our prayers with your!!
Gj Joe
My huge salute to all the brave souls who raised their voice for their brothers and sisters and loved ones in Ukraine! True Heroes! Wish there happens a miracle where all the lives could be back normal, without this war.
Your US and Soros dollars at work for a brighter future!
Protesting in a communist country. Looks like ottawa canada a couple weeks ago. Hypocrites & TRUTH-o-phobes, is this what you what for our nation ?? Censorship & suppressing TRUTH is pushing towards communism !!
So...UK had protests when UK sent troops to Iraq, Syria.......... Worldwide so many countries invading other countries protest against their own country's involvement!
За нашу и вашу свободу (For our freedom and yours)!
Putin keep doing what you're doing and remember that there is no man powerful than death,and disease.
At first i thought I was watching the RCMP arresting protesters in Ottawa... so hard to tell the difference between the Canadian police and the police in Russia... China... etc.
Maybe it's time for a REVOLUTION and say goodbye to the COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT......
And now Russia can be unanimously accepted as a dictatorship.
He is clearly a ruthless dictator and western countries are just quite about it
This is like calling the US southern border a actual invasion, bombing the people crossing and labeling them cartel backed separatists. Then the Mexican government says 'hey they live there' , if you aren't going to treat them with respect, abide by your laws and take care of them, then we are coming over so you stop bombing them. Who do you support? If your answer in neither you are correct. The 'seperatists' hould have never been there in the first place, but now that they are, you show them why they would WANT to be Ukrainians and not Russians. But that didn't happen and now for me, it's like if Trudeau and Biden were to fight. I would encourage they take each other out. Please!
Teach a lesson to greedy Putine. Put him out
There is a South park episode thag covers this
The end of the Putin era is nigh.
Extreme left views. MSNBC is pure propaganda.
If it is Illegal to Protest in Russia how was this even allowed?
Look at all those "Nazi" supporters, Putin....
As long as the unjust war continues the protests will continue
In Russia everyone is free to protest against those in power --> and afterwards free to die in GULAG or Hepatitis-C infested prison.
148 million people of Russia   A few thousand protesters , typical media b/s
Give me back my blood! Dedicated to the country lifetime shame! General Secretary Xi Jinping! Jiangsu Province Lianyungang city finance bureau and land tax director Zhang Wenwu Chen Xuebiao, chief prosecutor of xinpu District Procuratorate, was the chief offender In order to monopolize lianyungang people's political power to form underworld organizations Making the party! Making countries! Harm one party! -- Fabricating cases of tax evasion by large state-owned enterprises out of thin air Strike and persecute tax grass-roots leading cadres anti-corruption hero Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, National Supervisory Commission, and Central Political and Legal Commission: The litigant tai Xiuwen is currently a resident of Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. I used to be an excellent Communist party member, advanced cadre, transferred from the army to work in lianyungang City tax Bureau. During the years of working in the Tax Bureau, I repeatedly thought through the tax practice and wrote some tax papers and published them in provincial journals. During the period of head of collection unit, in order to put an end to the collection of personal tax, to put an end to the collection of relationship tax, to put an end to the phenomenon of embezzlement of state tax, the open tax handling was the first, which was highly valued by the main leaders of Lianyungang Municipal Committee, but also offended some leading cadres of tax. Some leaders hate me very much, because my practice has violated their personal interests. In early 1994, the tax system was reformed to implement VAT. For the initial inventory declared by lianyungang Agency of Jinan Motorcycle General Factory of China Light Motorcycle Group, a state-owned super-large enterprise, in February 1994, I directly signed "If the situation is true, it is allowed to be deducted", attachment 1. Source from case files of Lianyungang Intermediate People's Court. I'm proud of the time I saved the business. I was convicted for doing the right thing. I am so sorry! I feel so unfair! Is it difficult for a person who is dedicated to the country, the people and the Party to suffer such a disaster just because he inadvertently harmed the interests of some people through his active work? ! My whole life is ruined here! I want redress, I want to return their innocence!! I would like to offer some evidence on the record. In March 1995, during the two sessions, I complained to Zhang Siqing and Ren Jianxin against Chen Xuebiao, Zhang Wenwu and gang organizations. Annex 2 is from case file of Xinpu District Procuratorate. Direct way to their wind crazy revenge and cruel persecution. On December 30, 1996, Jiang was arrested. In March 1997, by the procuratorate Chen Xuebiao, Yuan Licheng instigation, Lianyungang Price Institute Xu Bing invented, fabricated genuine motorcycle price identification proof, constitute the crime of framing. Appendix 3. Source from case files of Lianyungang Intermediate People's Court. Zhang Wenwu and Chen Xuebiao conspire, instigate its classmate Yuan Niancheng, Zhao Shiqiao to fabricate, fabricate out of thin air the perjury evidence of tax evasion of state-owned super-large enterprises. I buy defective motorcycle, the actual value of 3000 yuan. I pay faithfully. Appendix 4. Source from case files of Lianyungang Intermediate People's Court. Not a penny less. A case based on perjury fabricated out of thin air by a gang is never exonerated, never popular. The cause was that Wang Yuzhong, as the director of minzhu Road tax office, embezzled state tax money by issuing tax invoices to collect taxes on individual businesses under his charge. When we took over Wang Yuzhong's custodian account, Uncle Chen found that Wang Yuzhong registered his tax receipt number and tax payment amount on the tax registration form of urban and rural individual industrial and commercial households. The invoice number is the same with the invoice issued by Wang Yuzhong, but the amount of tax is different. The large invoice is linked to the self-employed, which is the tax paid by the self-employed; the small invoice is linked to the tax, which is the tax filed by the tax bureau. Individual industrial and commercial door pays tax, it is the norm that decides according to pay taxes on the place that registers a form and duty pay tax. It is a matter of embezzling state tax money. I reported to Li Jiazhi, chief of the supervision department of Lianyungang City Tax Bureau, that after verification by the supervision department, the tax receipts were kept on file and it was found that they were all big and small for four consecutive months. At that time, the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee found me and made it clear that I would not check any more. Wang Yuzhong not only did not deal with it, but was promoted to director of the bureau. In Attachment 5, the evidence is provided by Li Jiazhi, former chief of personnel Supervision Department of Lianyungang Tax Bureau. Li now lives in Shanghai with her daughter. In October 1994, When Wang Yuzhong was the director of Xinpu Private Branch of Lianyungang City National Tax Bureau, Wang Yuzhong took advantage of his power and conspired with Yuan Licheng and Huang Xiaobo of the Tax prosecution office of Xinpu District Procuratorate in Xinpu Private Branch of National Tax Bureau to falsely retaliate and frame me. First, Wang Yuzhong fictionalizes the whole nation's state-owned enterprises to evade taxes. On December 2, 1994, Wang Yuzhong, in the name of Xinpu Branch of The State Taxation Bureau of Lianyungang city, fabricated "Decision on Handling Tax Violations", attachment 6, which was obtained from case files of Lianyungang Intermediate People's Court. Fictitious enterprise evades tax 628,629.96 yuan, did not arrive at the enterprise to sign for receipt, completely fictitious and fabricated. After being examined by the prosecutor's office, there was no tax evasion and no tax payment, so there is no tax payment certificate showing that the tax was paid back then. Two, in March 1997, Zhang Wenwu instigate students Yuan Niancheng fraud, Yuan Niancheng in the name of xinpu branch, fictitious time is November 23, 1995, fictitious "tax treatment decision book" (95) international tax New ji character No. 027. Annex 7 is from case files of Lianyungang Intermediate People's Court. No agent signature, only the sub-bureau director Yuan Nian Cheng signature, no municipal bureau director signature. 1, the bureau director has no authority, should have the tax committee to study the decision. No tax commission must also have the signature of the agent, the signature of the sub-director, the signature of the director of the municipal bureau. 2. Wang Yuzhong invented the punishment of tax evasion again four years later under the circumstance that there was no tax evasion and no tax payment after inspection by the procuratorate. It's illegal in itself. Tax preservation period is 6 months. There was no delivery to the enterprise, no enterprise signed for it. Completely out of thin air. Constitute a frame - up. On July 1, 1994, Jiangsu State Taxation Bureau was established. The former Jiangsu Provincial Taxation Bureau was immediately removed. In March 1997, Zhao Shiqiao pretended to be the Xinpu Branch of The State Taxation Bureau of Lianyungang city and used the Receipt of Fine of Jiangsu Taxation Bureau, which had been abolished four years earlier, as attachment 8, from the case file of Lianyungang Intermediate People's Court. Imaginary time on December 19, 1995, dealing with "tahe jinan motorcycle motorcycle factory lianyungang agencies" do not use the state tax bureau of jiangsu province fine receipt, because the state tax bureau of jiangsu province fine receipt in lianyungang city, the state administration of taxation inspection bureau irs sinpo branch has no right to use more power without punishment, and the penalty must be into the state Treasury, The signatory is Zhao Shiqiao. Fictitious tax evasion amount and Wang Yuzhong fictitious tax evasion amount is completely different, directly with state-owned enterprises to declare the beginning of the inventory to deduct the amount of tax, completely fabricated, fine 50,000 yuan. It wasn't delivered to the company. It was a fabrication. Constitute a frame - up. On August 5, 2013, the transcript of the conversation between the former Director of Liancheng Sub-Bureau and my lawyer who signed the Tax Treatment Decision Letter. At that time, Shao Jian, deputy director of Lianyungang Municipal Tax Bureau, and Qiao China, director of Lianyungang Municipal Tax Bureau inspection Bureau, were present. Moreover, Director Shao clearly proposed that we must seek truth from facts, say what we have, and bear legal responsibility. The former director of niancheng made it clear: the enterprise did not evade taxes, lianyungang City Tax Bureau of Xinpu branch, not to Ji 'nan light motorcycle general factory Lianyungang distributor made any tax, punishment decision. Appendix 9, provided by the lawyer. The tax registration book of Wang Yuzhong's urban and rural individual industrial and commercial households is the evidence of Wang Yuzhong's embezzlement of state tax, and also the root cause of my injustice. At that time, when the national and local taxes were divided up, Wang Yuzhong sent the chief of supervision department to my unit and secretly searched and destroyed it without directly asking me. It was still in my home in Macao. The parties strongly demand: the cancellation of criminal Judgment No. 63 of Xinxinzhuzi of People's Court of Xinpu District, Lianyungang City, Jiangsu Province (1997) and criminal order No. 27 of Lianyungang City Intermediate People's Court of Jiangsu Province (1997); Acquit the client and clear the client! advance Tai Xiuwen February 25, 2022:
It is another betrayal of US and West towards Ukraine after Afghanistan.   Poor Ukraine.
please,,,,, peace the world. Enemy true is israel.
Brothers and Sisters in Ukraine, 🇺🇦 the WHOLE EUROPE and CIVILIZED WORLD are with you in those dark hours, hold fast and stay strong! The help may be late, but it will come! Putin will NOT win, Democratic order will prevail and Ukraine will be free!
Power to the people of Russia, down with Putin.
Plz Save Ukraine
May Putin go to hell
Love how they arrested the balloons!😂😂
When protest occurs in another country: " God bless those people! I'm praying for you!" When a protest occurs in our country: " I wish those hillbillies would just STFU. Throw them in jail!"
send the truckers
The Russian people do not want this war.  This is the work of a madman. Prayers to the people of Ukraine, the Ukrainian soldiers and people everywhere, be safe.
It's Russia what do you expect. Protesting against war makes it stop only in 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗨.......ahhh well or other 𝘿𝙚𝙢𝙤𝙘𝙧𝙖......oh oh😁😜.  Anyway solidarity for Ukraine💪🇺🇦🇺🇦💪💪🇺🇦🇺🇦💪
Apparently, that "tough response" of sanctions and harshly worded replies is having the desired effect.
Russia is like germany before, i thought russia has the capability to understand more because they are once victims of  Hitler invasions but now what i thought is deferent they are more likely the same. But now i think germany is already know the lesson in fact they are one now who wants to have peace
stupid peoples!! If they know the reason behind attacking, they will never raise voice!!! For TV showoff they are doing ....
Now that the war has started, The U.S. and its ALLIES abandoned these poor BRAVE people. Sanctions?!?  The RUSSIANS are just laughing at them now, that's for sure!!!
Well done to these brave people standing up to Putin they have to get him out of power he's causing the world to be unstable well done to the Russian people
So much for Putin being "sure" that the Russian people were with him on taking Ukraine - and war! Putin is so full himself, just like Biden...no contact with their citizens and what THEY really want! 😕
I Hope A New President Was Set Up. Putin Has No Heart Towards Innocent People

We must have more like this because only the Russian army by refusing to fight can save humanity from Putin and a nuclear holocaust.
What a beautiful site
(((((_
Putin should face the court
That is beautiful, but I fear it will make no difference whatsoever to Putin. I genuinely pray I am wrong! God bless the protesters in Russia!
You can't protest in Russia, unless you looking to get hit with a club to the head, LoL
Wait….people are getting arrested in Canada, France and Germany the same way, how come you dont make it sound dramatic there too?
Putin needs to just STOP 🛑 his citizen just want peace! I pray 🙏 that everything gets better all my prayers to the Ukraine 🇺🇦
Good for you Russian people. Keep on keepin on 💪
Nobody wants this to happen it’s only Putin that’s why everyone hates him
Why nobody beg for peace in non-expansion of  NATO? Is it their right? Ukraine could easily evade war by waiving the NATO membership but they didn't. NATO isn't a trades or sports consortium it's the arch adversary of Russia. Ukraine declared enmity with it's neighbour Russia and called for help. Do they hope there would be any foreign soldier willing to die for them in vain?
This is where the world is headed.  Canada  Australia  New Zealand  . People who don't support government will be silenced
They'll get jailterm very soon, don't worry!😁
Woke Russians? LOL. For once I support the riot police. Thank you Russia! Much support from The Netherlands
Why nobody, no USA news, no Europe news were not showing what Ukraine was doing to their own people in Donezk and Lugansk. For 8 years they had war against that Pro-russian territory, demolishing everything, 13,000 people died as minimum including children. Putin is done with Ukraine. It's out of control. He has to protect his own country and people.
God those people with get put on trial for "corruption", or worse get sent to gulags, or worse yet get "disappeared".
all the world unite NOW , LETS CAPTURE PUTIN
Ukraine majority people supporting Russia, where as in Russia protests going on, itzzz a USA game plan
Those people are true heros.
Them protesters are traitors
1. Mother Russia in Bible (1 thru 7).    2. She is a [Rat].    3. She is Cornered by Western Politicians.   4. A Rat Attacks When Cornered.  5. Neighbors Suffering, Now.  6. The Rest of us Suffer, Next.   7. Mother Russia Destroyed By Heavenly Father, Eventually.    Regardless, Individuals Must Be Born-again To Go To Heaven !!!!
Ukraine and Russia share family history with each other..   The government doesn't care at all.
Looks like a fringe minority
My respect goes out with the people out there protesting against war
It would be nice if the American people would protest against all the unjustified wars from our tyrannical government. Everyone is speaking out about Russia, but its cricket, cricket when it comes to the war crimes that have been committed by our nation.
That is as false as Shakespeare's Cressida
There is two sides to every coins don't believe everything you see every country has it's own propaganda.
Here comes the liberal news! 💨
THE O.T.A.N CREATED THIS SITUATION.... THEY PROVOKED VLADIMIR..... PUTIN ITS JUST PROTECTING HIS TERRITORY & PEOPLE....🙄🙄🙄
Stay strong Russian protesters, we know it not in your name
Stand tall, be proud! for freedom, no more wars!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh my God the russian people are good people not like the mad putin
Man... that looks like Canada .... Respect to those folks (and the Canadians as well for their protest)... the violence I see on both were caused by the state
Because they impose tax on people to conduct war
Oligarchs may take care of Putin themselves if their wallet is threatened enough.
Looks like the start of ww3.
Smith nothing but Biden Harris progandist! Biden Harris failing! Just like when he gave Putin Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. Receiving millions from Putin cronies at the same time!
Theres still lot of good,peaceful and intelligent normal people in Russia, and they know putin is a liar. This gives some hope for better days.
Biden uncle already have used ukraine for its own vested interest to sanction against russia..poor ukraine got backstabbed by the ultimate backstabber usa😊
Russian people don’t want war ,I hope it will end soon🙏😭💔🇷🇺🇺🇦Ukraine be strong 🥺Please don’t think that Russian people made war ,nobody didn’t ask us about it ,we are also opposite of it.Our ancestors fought for our freedom, they would be really sad to know about this situation now 😿💔
Glad that some Russian people are protesting, but way too many are scared to protest.  Putin is nuts and he can't hide what he is doing these days.  If someone could take him out this would end.  I can't believe some Russian officials actually think they need to go into Ukraine and that Ukraine is a threat to Russia.  Sad all around.
Lord God 🙏🏽 please help and save your people in Ukraine
Kudos to these protestors
Protest doesn't work in communist country.
Putin ! You are a killer !
Only 4% of the people there are opposed to the war. It is shocking what the majority of Russian citizens think about it.
Arrest putin russian police, putin is big murderer
God please send your angels of love and protection to Ukraine and to Russian protesters in the name of Jesus. Thank you Amen🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Like in Ottawa-Canada👍🏻
Bless those brave and righteous people who are doing nothing wrong and are doing the right thing! Stay Strong. utmost respect for real life heroes
Where are USA and England now after pushing Ukraine in war, in fact after humiliating defeat in Afghanistan the USA is no more super power.
Russian people are good but very foolish to vote n chose n elect  such merciless n inhuman Person like it's present President.  Russian people should know  that , what goes around that comes around. Wait n watch due to Dictatorship, people wil suffer.
Love from India
Every  nation as got traitors... Why and where were they all this time when Ukraines were shelling their brothers in Donbass... West brain washed traitors.
Be strong Russians. I'm so happy people has such reaction to this terrible war. You shouldn't back out now. This war of one man should stop. I know it's hard but unity of people is the strongest weapon that can free Russian and Ukrainian people from this tyrant.
The Putin regime is the real enemy.
Putin needs to go take a nap next to Lenin.
Glad to see Russians not back Putin.... But this won't stop nothing. Please God watch over us, as world war ³ is likely to begin.
Who believe in America 🤥 see Ukraine... 🙄 Alarming India Taiwan... 😞
there wasn't that many protesters in reality this is being really blown up more than it is true yeah there are protests but there's not thousands of people taking to the streets either it's more like hundreds
Meanwhile TORTURES & RAPES all over Russian prisons: https://youtu.be/ZrWrOP3QKIw
Today marks the Anniversary of People Power in the Philippines. 1986 when the dictator Ferdinand Marcos was overthrown. He ruled the country for 20yrs. Dont let another Hitler rule your country!
Love, peace not war please!
Where are the masks
Media👎👎
I thought the west didn't like protest no more 🤣
Russians feel safe if nuclear bombs are placed in front of their homes.
So send BLM
I'd love to see 16 million people in Russia break free from the dictatorship of Vladimir Putin.
This was planned years ago
Let God be with the protesters
I am so proud of these Russians who are willing to stand against Pootin and his ilk! It gives me hope.
The whole world 🌎 have our deepest sympathy for Ukrainians from suffering this assault on their sovereignty as a country.???
Like in Canada?
Let them protest for Libya ,Iraq , Yemen ,Palestine Et al  .let them and the west stop being hypocrates
The strategy to face Putin is the people of Russia 🇷🇺 must force Putin to stop 🛑 aggression against their neighbors and destroying democracy and peoples freedoms and sovereignty period.???
Do every thing to stop Nato expansion and save Russia from agression of the west . Remove the US puppet Ukraine President .Blame the west for this war if it was russia arming Mexico would have the US government waited for it to happen .Give us a break .The US has invaded many countries and you never pointed it out or sanction them ,so stop being Hypocrates. Have pity too for people in Syria ,Yemen ,Iraq ,Libya
Please show videos of American protesting in America against Iraq war.
Respect to those People
It's never the people that have a problem with each other. It's the politicians.  Just because Russia doesn't like Ukraine doesn't mean Russians don't like their brothers and sisters
NATO alert! ,Hitler has been reborn
Putin  must  be  hanged  for  his  war  crime.
Take this evil benevolent dictator Vladimir Adolph Putin out!!...I hope he is taken out.   He is pure evil...he has made his country full of hate and discrimination.   His palace needs to be bombed.   Vile M****F****  My heart aches for the people of Ukraine and the good people of Russia who are rising and standing up for the Evil's of War.
Всем кто хочет быль слугами США надо дать возможность ,что бы увеличили там колличество безработных
when you live in a communist country, you have no rights. Take note, you lefty marxist looneys.
What a mess.
The global government wants war and power! The people want peace and freedom! Don’t obey the psychopaths!
I rather die standing up than live on my knees!
"Putin has plans to restore the Soviet-Union".  NONSENSE.  Putin is many things.  War-Criminal.  Autocrat.  Wannabe Tsar.  Assassin.  But he is not a comedian.  He's only been saying it plainly and directly for many years ------>  GO AHEAD.  TRY to make Ukraine "part of NATO".  Just like when Nikita TRIED to make Cuba "part of the Warsaw-Pact" by deploying Soviet-Missiles).  Uncle Sam was ready to take them out by bombing.  Fidel too was a comedian.  But he wasn't very funny.  What's happening to Ukraine is a MONSTROSITY.   The world hasn't learned anything in nearly a CENTURY after WWII.  Let's not obsess only with this Frankenstein's-Monster.    Let's also focus on Dr. Frankenstein.  Google Vladimir Pozner --->  on How NATO and the West, (mis)LED by U.S. made Putin the creature stronger. (The actual title of the youtube video is  "How the United States created Vladimir Putin" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X7Ng75e5gQ&t=16s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG2beCe2AUw
At least they know this is not how it should be... They know this is really wrong...
This are the ukis living in Russia fifth column trojan horse.
Putin would not invade Ukraine without the blessing of the Chines Gov. The Chinese want Taiwan. and Biden with his stupidity could easily drag us into WW3. Putin is not going to stop in Ukraine. he's got much larger plans. which will affect the entire world's economy.
The humanity must stop putins carnage in Ukraine!!  Now is time for acting direct towards putins killing people in  Ukraine! Humanity is tired from epidemic, is tired of impotent political infinite discussions and agreements, meanwhile the number of Ukrainian offers are increasing!!!   What is power of action of “ Bucharest 9” agreements to help direct Ukrainian people??  The War between Ukraine- Russian is not a local one,  it is global!!! What are waiting the presidents of USA and Europe, that this maniacal dictator to ingurgitate the whole Ukraine???
Imagine being proud to be Russian how embarrassing
If The west doesn’t stop Putin now he is going to come after your countries. Do it now and don’t wait till it’s too late. Putin is miles ahead in regards to planning. The west is to blame for allowing Putin to develop these weapons and the west is too naïve when dealing with Putin. Maximum sanctions and removing Russia from Swift 20 years ago would have contained Putin.
USA and Nato are to blame foreigner countries keep your countries and we will keep our Ukraine and Russian.
Russia is doomed with putin in power
Putin is an arshole
What’s wrong with you Americans? There is a T in Putin. Pronounced Poo-Tin. Not Pu’N!!
End this nonsense, No More War
#EndWarInUkraine!!!
Russian people are being very brave and deserve our thanks, the only way to bring Putin down is from within, hopefully a number of officers in their armed forces will force a coup and take him out, unless he is dead there is a huge danger of nuclear war.
Russia reeeeeally needs it's own Operation Valkyrie.
Russia must seek out the protest leaders and immediately arrest them! they are usually traitors who abuse the ideas of Russians community, usually carry foul plans for national order! also hum are usually anti soviet union ! all those people who appear on the street must be pushed back to their homes! no pardon for land traitors who hate highness of old Soviet Union empire! we'll be back!
Ppl all over the world are soo poisoned by their media and dont understand that at least 60-70% you see in news are videos cut and edited in right order to satisfy goals of someone who publishes them
Golden opportunity to sow decent in Russia . Finance and supply opposition groups .
Those anti war protests deeply impressed me and i hope the war to be end soon.. my sencere prayer for ukraines and every tyranny must be vanished from the globe we stands.
If I saw vlad I would say.  I’m the machine!!!!  Iykyk
President Ukraina 😜😜
Brave people. Who knows if the Gulag is still operating?
Much better if these also happens in america,because of its occupation of northern Syria and al tanf,and worst,plundering of Syrian oil and grains on a daily bases..
Just cus thousands of people protest doesn’t  mean that that’s the majority of the country that don’t stand behind Putin…..  Irdc but I’m just saying  Russia population os more than however many people went out to protest,  you can’t make a statement saying “clearly russias people don’t stand behind him”  Instead it’s more like clearly SOME people not all the people.
Wow theyre not aren't even using tear gas or horses 🤯
Vote him out thank you Protesters for not defending this ruthless act
Putler will bring the Gulags back
What a psychopathic lier is putin! Great courage people are showing!
That mean Putin is not bad of dictator , as these protesters would have sent to heaven by real dictator. Russians are good too for protesting cz these protest would have erupted all over west against IRAQ , Syria and Afghanistan millions would have been saved today .
OBYWATELE ROSYJSCY PROTESTUJCIE ! TERRORYSTA PUTIN ATAKUJE NIEWINNĄ UKRAINĘ I ZABIJA LUDZI, MAŁE DZIECI, NISZCZY BUDYNKI. OBYWATELE ROSYJSCY WALCZCIE O PRAWDĘ I POKÓJ !!!
WAR CRIMINALS GO TO HELL PLEASE,,,,FIGHT YOUR WAR YOU WANTED IN HELL WITH SATAN.
This world will be a better place to live without Putin. This world will be a better place to live without Xi. This world will be a better place to live without Communism.
I don't believe in all this western news. All are propaganda machines of the western media's.
We are witnessing the FALL OF VLADIMIR PUTIN.
Well this is hilarious. Communists thinking that they can have any influence on their communist government? Under communism, it is the government that controls the people, not the other way around. Putin doesn't have to have the support of his people - that is kind of the point of communism.
Vlad is mad, he is suicidal, wants to take people with him.   Vlad is like Herod.
No to war just peace and love..war is not a solution
Russian protesters are so brave to face the policemen for the sake of peace. Respect from Philippines.
i’m sorry but police in russia are so stupid because their basically asking for their families to die thinking not think the true horror of death
Damage is done lives lost economy destrayed.americas objective fulfilled. Jewish objective achieved. If war breaks out Jews will benefit as they benefited from world war I and II. Watch. They have already stolen the codes through Donald now they will fire and destroy the two world powers so that they rule with their flicking messiah.wake up wake up.
“Bloody invasion”? Russia has not attacked civilian settlements in Ukraine and will not occupy Ukraine. They have only disabled Ukrainian military infrastructure in order to protect the republics in the Donbas region, in the border with Russia, who have declared independence from the USA-puppet Kiev government, which has bombarded them for the last 8 years killing thousands— and yesterday Russia acknowledged their independence, so they are now giving them military assistance, while still trying to avoid full-on war. It’s important to not only watch western media but also pay attention to the Russia Today media outlet RT. In Spanish there’s a lot of information available, with many declarations by Putin in the last few months, but unfortunately the information in English is far more limited. Still, with some patience people can find Putin and Russian foreign affairs minister doing many declarations, telling how they have been trying to negotiate their country’s security for years, but NATO(USA army) continues to avance towards their borders with nuclear-capable weapon installations. The bully is not Russia, the bully is USA, with Europe —and now Australia too— as its puppy dogs.
Russian's people please tell your president we 💕 peace....no more war...
God Protect and bless the protestors for their bravery. Comon Putin. Don’t hurt People, Man!
No more war <3  PEACE IN EUROPE Lest we forget :'(
and the police were beating up people who were protesting wtf!!
Long live the USSR
Also show the people in support of war not just the opposite
If a million Russians protested around Moscow the police wouldnt have a chance to arrest them they would be overrun the power of the people would win over.
Also show the supporting him
PUTIN IS A LIL MAN... DEVIL
Americans a draft may be upon us in the near future
Fake news what about the Canadians oh yer remember them
Looks just like Canada!
It's funny,I can remember all the anti-war protests before Iraq,over a million in the UK with many many arrests and still the USA set fire to the middle East 🤔
Russian protest war, because they want peace. But Putin wants. 🙏🙏🙏
Good luck to Russia annihilating the Ukrainian vassals
Thanks for the support for Ukraine and kind request please gather large in number and start non alignment movement against the President Putin. Your support can escalate the military from war crisis Ukraine.
It's going spiritual war for human souls. We are in the End Times.. 🙏 Turn to the LORD before it's too late. 🙏 Jesus is the only way to GOD and heaven.
Why aren't people in the US demonstrating in mass over this? Where are the Liberals? Where are the pro-peace university students? Why hasn't the elite of Hollywood condemned this war?
Bagus Rakyat Russia .Sila bantah perang ini. Ia akan merugikan negara anda
Russians are peaceful people and peace loving people.
Gila russia . tak hormat jiran. Sanggup nak takluk negara jiran
Yeah because Ukraine was such a threat to Russia
What a dirty attack on there own people . Shame on you Putin they are your people , your a power hungry war criminal
Let us not forget these great Russian Souls who just want there own peaceful lives.  Defiance and the strong human resolve to be free and prosper will always Trump the Opressors.  Only time will tell. Putin your dopamine rush will wear off just like all that have tried before you and you will be another rogue brute in the history books.   If he believes in the life after there is a lot of Real Estate on Uranus.
Stop sacrificing sons and daughters...go yourself Putin
The duty of a leader is to serve their people, not for the people to serve them!
The people in Russia knows this is wrong.. puttin is sick.. all those senseless deaths.. blood on puttins hands.. he'll is waiting for puttin.
guess another tiananmen square is gonna happen
Does Putin even has a conscience? How can he eat and sleep while people, children are dying because of him.. :(
The soldiers are the cowards. If they use their brain to think what is right and have 1/10 of the courage of these citizens, Putin is already in jail now.
please stop the war save the children  #stopwar #savethechildren
No War !! Lets protest people ! We are the big force ! Without us they have noting !
Canada = Russia but one protest was not covered at all
These are antinationals, who's forefathers broken USSR. Monitor these. They must have foreign funding link. Else they won't have stood against own nations interest of security.
You mean Putin and Trudeau did the same thing  ? Why then didn’t you cover the protests in Canada ? This is why no one trust the media !!!!!
Lmfao- had the confidence of the Russian people. Dude there like f u cause we want worldwide peace. Enough of this dictatorship as we're going to suffer. The EU immediately turned off the main gas pipeline into Russia.  Imagine in the middle of winter and no gas to cook,shower or even stay warm.His demonic behavior will come back n bite him in his pale chulo.
Put him down...ONLY One needed to go
Even many Americans were against American invasion of Iraq but they didn't stop...Putin will never.May God send all these evil politicians straight into hell who are never gonna suffer for their actions but their innocent civilians do.
This was & still is Trump's dream for all Americans !
The Russian people should over throw there gov and help stop war
This are the good Russians who opposing an oppressive government. They are million they are few.The people shouldn't not be afraid of them,and soldiers should be on the right side not the criminals.
Thumbs up to the Russian people for standing up to that evil madman
Russians citizens is the key to stop Putin of invading Ukraine. PEACE on Earth 🌎🌍🙏🙏🙏
Well done Russian peace loving citizens. Well done.
Putin throws teenagers and old people to the ground with the hands of the police, they beat them in the police departments. They destroy everything, they arrest the elderly people who protected us from Nazi Germany, people who survived the blockade of St. Petersburg for us to have a future. Bur there is no future in Russia with Putin. We just want peace, we want to get rid of the bloody dictator no less than people who do not live in Russia want it. And we will go out until we are heard. Ukraine we are with you
sure they did :)))
Distribute this video! Let the politicians stop rocking the boat! Let this video spread, then we will be able to achieve Peace! Let's join hands!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieZTS0gRy2s
I support every good Russians who defy Putin.
Brave protestors standing up for their neighbors will end up in Putin's gulag.
Empty words. Putin isn't dangling from a noose. Russian soldiers squeezing triggers.
It's finally the beginning of the end for the putin regime you'll see.  The United States and its allies allowed him to start his madness in order to prove his illegitimacy and so that he could be hit.  Maybe a drone who knows ..
Very stupid move. Smh should've never been allowed to become president. This is the same fear the u.s had when trump was president...
Now the Europeans are tasting their medicine. The killing of the people of Yemen, Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan by the European and Western governments. Nobody cared when the people of the Middle East cried blood. Why should the people of the Middle East care about your war and pain? You call Putin an evil man, so what is the difference between Putin and the Americans who invaded Afghanistan and Iraq and killed thousands of innocent people? And you closed your eyes to humanity while you knew. Well, I think now I also believe in karma.
AMERICA AND NATO LEFT UKRAINE. ANOTHER SOUTH VIETNAM. #BIDEN WEAK ADMIN. #WHAT THE USE OF MILITARY? JUST DISPLAY???   #FREEEDOM NEED SACRIFICE. #NO PEACE WHILE EVIL EXIST.  USA, ISRAEL, NATO AND ASIAN ALLIES VS. RUSSIA, CHINA, NORTH KOREA AND IRAN  #END CORRUPTION, CRIMES, DRUG CARTEL AND TERRORISM.
Footage (arrests)exactly like  the cops here in 🇨🇦 for the trucker convoy!!
God Bless Protesters...Trudeau should take note and leave Protesters alone especially peaceful loving protesters...fu...Trudeau and Putin you are both mad with power nonsense
One. Two. Three. Four. We don’t want another war!
F Putin and all that follow him
Can't do anything  but respect  the Russians who protest. I salute you guys.... 👏🙌
I can't believe people are being treated like this in Canada...oh...wait..
My prayer's go out to the  Ukrainian people and the Russian's that are frisking life itself for what's right. The World is with you.Stay Strong !!!!!!
Утро ясное сколько будем смотреть на этот беспредел куда смотрит Мир Людей Планеты Убивают захватывают Земли амбиции империи руки крови остановить немедленно!!! Утро 24 Февраль 2022 год это Утро 1941 года остановите насилия над Людьми Планеты!!!
Get rid off this ... it's one man against he's own people and world and he started war FFS why he's don't go in front line brave brave man Putin should be change to H..
I love Russians, their culture, language and I am sooooo deeply disappointed by Putin´ s steps.  I would like to thank all Russians that don´t support him.  I am from the former Czechoslovakia and we have had our very bad experience with the Russian help, which in fact meant the Russion occupation and smothered any possible sparkles of freedom.  The Putin´s retoric and lies are very much the same as those in 1968 with the aim of persuading the Russians he just wants to help the surpressed.  That´s ther reason our country became the member of NATO, to avoid whatever similar happening to our country from the Russian side.  Peace to Ukraine!!!  Sending prayers to all Ukrainian people.
DOSE NOBODY CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF THE DONBASS REPUBLICS? WTF!?
I have one question if Russia and china will do military excercise with canada near usa then what would be the reaction of usa at that time ?
US, UK and allies were completely asleep on Russia and now scared to even do anything against 1 man’s quest for dominance. Cowards.
No Wars pls.
Please let's not hate Russian civilians they are not the there are the one it's only Putin
The Russian army is mostly conscripted, refuse to fight and the war stops. That would be  true people power.
No body wants WAR...Well Done Russian People 👍🏻
It's sad that those people are paying the price for one crazy lunatic
We all have a problem with our so called leaders it's time we re looked at this, they should not have this much power, non of them have proven that they are fit for the job
Russian's doing a "Trudeau" against protester that peacefully protest.
That is YOUR COUNTRY RUSSIA! STAND UP! THERE ARE MORE OF YOU THAN THEM IN GOVERNMENT ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Russian people want peace. fascist dictators want war......but theyre happy to send your sons to fight.
my friend who was a russian riot control task force m=commited a mutiny and supported the protest and because of that he got arrested for 3 months
Why do US politicians have so much interest in Ukraine? Why would Russia  want control of Chernobyl? The US has 13, maybe 15 Bio Labs in Ukraine  and B Gates has even said, on camera, "the next pandemic will really get  everyone's attention." Interesting huh?
THE WORLD IS PRAYING FOR UKRAINIAN AND WE DON'T WANT WAR STOP THIS NONSENSE.
Let's go Brandon
This is going to blow up in Putin's face. We are all Ukrainians today.
War is hell, and ALWAYS be hell.
MEANWHILE,  ANOTHER Black Man has been murdered by Minneapolis police on a no knock warrant. When Goerge Floyd was murdered and the ppl stood up against corruption in the United States,  White ppl were OUTRAGED and Im willing to bet that more than half of those same hypcocrites are in these comment sections PRAYING FOR RUSSIA AND UKRAINE.  Those protesters looked exactly like us when the police was beating and pepper spraying innocent U.S. citizens.  Last, but not least, how can DEMONIC ppl pray for Anyone??? Hypocrisy at it's finest. When Katrina hit New Orleans, the ppl were met with shotguns at the borders of neighboring states,  but these SAME PPL are praying for another nation. Stop it!!!
The world now know Putin is pure evil. Russians people need to stand up and remove Putin .
The world 🌎 knows it is not the everyday citizen of Russia 🇷🇺 doing this evil!!! It’s the Russian government.. peace to the people of Russia!!! Stand up for your freedom and liberties!!!!!!
Another fake western media went viral on youtube again. Its common nowadays when things aren't goes well.
Respect to those Russian supporting peace.
Respect to all the Russian protesters.....not rioting & looting businesses like Americans.
Your not gonna win  this. Russia is deterement  to do this😅
Mind bulging how putin can take a whole country of Russia 🇷🇺 to the slaughtering house,Russian mothers will not like their children to be returned in body bags,this war is wrong n the world stands with all Ukrainians.Be stong !!!❤
I agree they are aware that they will be arrested but still they oppose the war
The US again managed to create a war on foreign soil. It's time to make a profit!
Good for them....the POWER OF FREEDOM!!!
Vladimir Putin has not only attacked Ukrainians he has also attacked his own people they also will suffer due to his actions. The people of Europe will all suffer from Putin's war
Americans always use stupid people to be their victims and America will be hell soon
Putin underestimates just how much of the world hates him; including his own people.   You have the power! Get out there and show them what Russia is doing is not okay! ❤
¡No más guerra! Queremos paz también! Mexico 🇲🇽 stands with the people of Russia 🇷🇺 and Ukraine 🇺🇦
Already deaths over 130 in Ukraine most of them civilians 😔
And what is about the Ukrop Agressions against the People in Donbass??? When they are afraid not to be allowed to speak their own Russian Language because some Ukrop Faschists do not want that so I pick up the Kalaschnikow and fight for my People.Besides Russia don t want that NATO is on its border!
Given how Putin tortures dissenters.... The protestors have a courage beyond our imagination
Mr  Putin Russian  will not  support your  unprovoked  brutal  war on  Ukraine and  they are revolting on your face  so deal with it
Seize all oligarchs assets in the west and give back to the people! Grow a spine US and UK
heart goes to those on the front lines. No country should ever have a dictator
Looks like the Western funded NGO's in russia are in an overdrive to fund protest movements inside russia to show that the people are not with russia on this one. None of these protesters would have an answer if asked about their countries security if Ukraine is pulled into NATO by the US. US missiles will be reaching them in 5-6 minutes. What a bunch of stupid brainwashed fools.
What if all of those people attack wearing masks, these 10 police men?
🤍HUMANITY>patriotism🤍
Lol. MSM continue to brainwash their citizens. Russian speaking people are being attacked by Ukraine forces in Donbass despite having Ukraine citizenship.  Search for National endowment of democracy. Funding people to protest. You could almost find them everywhere around the world.
Maybe the world needs to put there feet in Ukrainians shoes. Women and children, elderly trying to flee. Not knowing if there going to live or die. The fear upon the women and children's faces, while they hear explosions. Hiding in a subway station, no food, water, lying on a cement floor, waiting to live or die. Can you imagine grabbing your children and running with them for their lives? Take Putin out!
Why do I get the feeling this will result in a second Russian Revolution?
To all the protestors against this war, stay strong, stay safe. History will judge you kindly. Is there any news about Belorussia?
YES that will do it. That will help swing it in Ukraine favor. If Putin is doing this on his own and the people don't want it.
Year all of them sure that's not Canada has Soros up to his tricks
I wish i was as Brave as them.
Come on people just fkn storm his castle and hang him, like the french people did with their King.
This will be the downfall of Putin and pressure on Russian Oligarchs. You guys are fuked
ну не все нацысты
Down with Putin!!!
Where are un forces ffs?
Putins gestapo in action. Stay strong 🇷🇺 🪆
#supportprotestukrainepeacerussia
We are all human beings, love each other. We don't need war, we need peace
Turkey.  ☝️👊👊👊👊👊👊
These people are brave and have my respect.
The Deep State is in trouble, Úkráine is/was their base of operation. The Deep State was planning another pãndémic and developing vírúses in Úkráine, Pútin took action to shut it all down and to destroy the Deep State stronghold. He is now removing the néo nâzis
long live Putin, godless westerners know nothing about Russia
This is just as big of a story as any. And make not mistake it’s just as important.
Grabe na Ang brutality nila...these is the strategy of devil mind to declare war and invade other nation.
I want to thank Joe Biden for this! Campaigning Trumps policies were wrong in dealing with Putin only to undo them when elected just to reimpose them today! Biden is such a cluster f!
Good for the Russian people for protesting. The world stands with Ukraine
Go Russian people!! Get rid of Putin like you guys did to get rid of Nicholas II 100 years ago!!
Bravo to the protesters!
The UN, Nato and other relevant Allies must come together and push back against Putin at all costs.  Don’t give him Ukraine like how Chamberlain gave Hitler Europe.  If we give an inch he will take a mile and unfortunately we already gave him Crimea years ago, it’s no wonder he felt emboldened to do this
Time to give Putin a dose of his own medicine (POISON) WINK WINK
Is that Brian Stelter in disguise???🤣🤣🤣 Hey look it's Brian stelter's half brother Byron   Stelter🤣🤣🤣
Putin is a demented monster. Protect the protesters. Prayers for Ukraine
Think we will get this kind coverage of the coming Trucker protest????
Please keep track of all this people. All the ones Putin has arrested. Put their pictures on the wall and demand their return!
What a stupid dicision made by putin. He just killing his own brother bombing invading. Fool.
Poor USA. It lost all the wars from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Due to  bad economic and political situation at home, this is a good time to push Ukraine and Europe into war with Russia. Who is the victim at the end? naive Ukraine and Europe.  People, stop this dirty propaganda from the USA.
God bless braved people❤️❤️❤️
Putin badass
Putin go putin go putin
"GOOD BYE PUTIN".... THE WHOLE WORLD INCLUDING YOUR OWN RUSSIAN PEOPLE ARE AGAINST YOU
Good thing their guns were taken away.
They need to remove Putin and put him in an old people's home. Provide him with a laptop where he can play online war games to satisfy his thirst for battle. My prayers and tears goes to all the innocent people of Ukraine and Russia.
You know someone is truly evil when they poison their political opponents to guaranty winning the election and extending their time in office.
Presidents start the war, and they always send the poor
Now if we/they could make Putin himself go to the frontlines to fight
Stay strong Russia citizens, you are correct!
To hell with Putin and Trump
China is taking notes by cranking up more surveillance
Is the Rus president Sick ??? or Dying ? Russia is not  under  threat, and not even in the life span of V.Putin  that a country could be a threat to RUssia. Also,  the Russian economy  is currently  blooming, but Why on earth he directed to Ruin the peace  and Lives of Ukranian??? Only dying people  has this attitude and behaviour.. Im just wondering if  the  Rus Presisdnet is  sick or Dying??? is his physical health ok????or maybe just bored  from yeaars of lcovid lockdowns...
India supports Putin Not the Russians.
Respect to Russian people protest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To our Russian comrades speak up...stay safe
Psycho Putin ....
Take a good look at what is doing Putin whit is own citizens and the citizens off oder suverine contry,   He will be remembered for life like a bad example
Looks like Canada
“as expected an true to historic pattern” lol thats the same thing canada is doing and the same thing american police do lmfao they act like its just russian police that do this. anyone see the canadian police on horseback trampling the citizens actually doing real peaceful protests? lol 😂 insanity.
West
Paid protesters, go Russia 🇷🇺
All the protesters are women
I hope Putin will take it seriously and contemplate his action....
Thank you the good people of Russian that want peace. I hope the soldiers will do the same.
We're at a time where the people stand firm against dying for old men filled with greed, prayers to the people of Ukraine and Russia this war is a threat to world order
NED paid protesters.
Ukraine and NATO played with fire and got burnt. Let’s not have a short memory and forget what they were doing for the past month
Just go on strike at all cost
Pray for the protestors being tortured right now in secret Putin Prisons. #PrayForRussianProtestors #RussianProtestors #RussiaProtests
1:25 ouuuu, balloons, we must protect the people from them.
"There is no holding back an idea whose time has come" ❤️❤️
God is in heaven and Russia is on earth
Thank you for mentioning Navalny!!!  I believe this invasion is partly a cover-up of his trial.
We should do the same In the US 🤣😂 "we don't want war brandon"
Putin be like: c'mon man i just started!
Putin's days in power are numbered. Ukraine will be his demise. When the Soviet Union fell apart, there were popular uprisings in Russia and all the Warsaw Pact countries. And the Communist leaders were thrown out but not killed or imprisoned. Eric Honecker of East Germany was arrested and sentenced to 25 years in prison. But it was decided he was too ill and died destitute with his daughter and her family in Chile. The only country, and the last, where the Communist leaders were overthrown was Romania. Nicolae Ceaucescu and his wife Elena, were die hard Stalinsts right up to the end when the Romanian people had had enough and on Christmas eve. 1989, the Ceaucescus were arrested given a 2 hour trial, found guilty and taken out into a courtyard and shot. The only Communist leaders to be executed. The Ceacescu palace in Bucharest was the 2nd biggest building in the world - built on the backs and suffering of the Romanian people. The Romanian Secret Police rivaled Stalin's NKVD. Putin should take heed. His demise is coming.
Putin, XiJinPing, Donald Trump, all international terrorist heads and need to be eliminated  for humanity’s sake.
To the Russian people. Keep up the protests. It's time to over throw Putin. He's a danger to your country.
i love you  RUssian people anbd  Uckranian people !!! ROMANIA LOVES YOUUU !!1 PEACE BETWEEN BROTHERS!!!!
Christians killing Christians... Both are mostly Orthodox Christians.... Brother James 🙏🙏🙏
America is the cause of this war. do not buy weapons from America's stupid country.
Dear Russians, protest while you still can.  But, have an emergency plan to get the hell out of there - Putin does not know the amount of danger he is playing with.
ロシアの民間人も可哀想だな。 戦争で苦しむのは間違いなく民間人である。 プーチンは愚か者だな。
Turn Russia into glass.
no war...no war 😭stop war
To the russian people please stand up against putin your the only ones that can stop him 100 millon man march take him out stand for peace
Just remember Trump tried to destroy NATO. 2022 now I see why. Traitor.
remember that there is more people than soldiers and police
Jello pUtin is trying to bring conflict and chaos on to his own people due to his gReed
Well it's the system that has a problem not the people. Putin what have you done?
NOBODY respects a weak president in our WH.  China is watching closely and will be launching their attack on Taiwan soon KNOWING Biden won't do anything about it.....FACT!! Thanks Liberals for putting your SENILE puppet in the WH.....now we're ALL paying for it!!  DAMN THE LIBERAL MEDIA AGENDA AND YOUR IGNORANCE TO NOT SEE IT COMING!!!
Russia is tired of gangster jello putiN
Nobody wants a war, Soldier's don't want to die, and families  don't want to bury their children, it's dangerous to have a dictator pretending to be a president, God have mercy on us all 😇🌿
He will need the rest of his troops and tanks to fight his own people
".....in times of peace, prepare for war!"                                              -gOg
Prayers for the Russian protestors against this unnecessary war and prayers for the Ukrainian people and their President and their families ❤️‍🩹 🙏🏻 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Still the US is not giving assurance to Russia that NATO will not expand eastwards. That would have saved lives.
Deep Respect for the Russian people protesting against this unnecessary war against Ukraine 🇺🇦
But he has carlson and trump on his side.
Stay strong Russian neighbors, we in America don't want this violence either. Fight the power!
Nobody wants this war …Putin is a LOOSER 💔❤️‍🩹💔💔💔
Wow, Russia is as bad as Canada about protests
Respect to the Russian people for standing up! keep it up guys. Peace Love Empathy From Australia.
This is somewhat entertaining seeing this unfold, both Ukraine and his own people resist him. Now I’m just getting popcorn and hoping to see the Mad monster be turned on by those businesses and his own military!  Stand for Ukraine and down with the regime!
#NO MORE WAR!!
As..nato menjdi penyebab utama..as nato afraid..sat perang as nato lari dan panik tidk ikut perang.mka putin serangn terus sampi habis..dan ukraina tidsk nma negara..lagi ini semua pengaruh as.biden perusak ukraina dan nato pulang kampung ukraina perang.lagi perang tidk seimbang..
Putin is gonna shoot his on foot. Even his fellow Russian are against him. He'll go down in history as a tyrant.
Nothing will come of this Putin will reign supreme .
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🤬✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽.  🚫🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🚫
Thank you Russians for standing no to war!!
So the whole of the proAmerican 5th column in Russia , 1600 of them in toto, has been detained and fined. The rest of Russians of 144 mln approve the de-Nazification and demilitarization operation of Russia into Ukraine. The Ukrainian armed forces have already dissolved as a fog in the thin air. The US-fed  ultra- nationalist proWestern regime in Kiev is agonizing. In 3 days max. it will collapse altogether. Next time Ukrainian voters hopefully elect more democratic rulers.
Huge salute to all the brave Russian protesters standing up for what they believe!  Keep protesting!
We’re in support of the people of Russia. The president of Russia is a straight up thug
People around the world should come to Russia embassy and protest Putin, burn pic of Putin, he only wants to show the world he is a killer, Russian wants peace not killing people.
God bless..
Rasputin where are you now?  Moscow!
To the Russian people protesting the war, I stand with you. I salute your bravery.
That shows that Putin has no support in his own country.
Genokillers, los dañados por los pinchazos quieren justicia.  .  Los responsables tienen que pagar.
It's all the fault of the West and NATO .. ​​How many countries have they not bombed in the last 50 years ?? ... How many countries has Russia bombed China or Iran hmm think it says 10-1 .. Has their so called democracy succeeded hahah 0 ....✌🏻❤️✌🏻❤️ Peace To All Real Humans❤️.. Think for yourself many media are propaganda media bought and sold unfortunately ..   Yes to true news..  They went into false fraudulent wars and destroyed families children infrastructure threw atomic bombs on opponents smashed the Middle East!! .. And no it was not Russia China or Iran🔥.. Think for yourself the media are deceivers and propaganda machines👎🏻👎🏻 .. They are puppets for the elite and always jump high for them like a puppy .. Always follow the money .. ??? PEACE PEACE REAL PEACE 4 ALL LIKE USA DID
What demands?
Why are all these clowns not in a gulag yet?
People ask what sanctions do. This is what sanctions do, destabilize the populace.
Prayers for Ukraine and the Russians who stand against Putin!! Peace not war!!
Please Putin listen to your people  the world already had tough times because of the pandemic now your starting a war nobody want this.
Bloody Putin bullies, Viva the ppl of Russia down Putin dictator
damn. looks like Canada.
This is big brothers war, not the people's war.   Putin is a JEW.  NOT EVEN A RUSSIAN.  his mother is full blood Jewish.
Kudos to the protesters, Putin is suffering from a hero's syndrome and this is not supposed to be happening in the 21st century, the whole World  must come out strongly and resolved this matter now in a peaceful style.
Navalny's supporters, this is no anti-war movement.
The state wants violence.
Keep protesting!!!!!
Like I've always said. Hitler did not finish the job to conquer Europe, and it is time for Putin to get the job done for Hitler. After that, Russia will build a holocaust concentration camp for the Ukrainians. This is how WWIII starts.
Not all Russians approve of Putin's actions! Prayers for the Ukraine!
And the US citizens at the Canadian border protesting against Biden.
Praying that Russia wins🙏
Show those idiots pictures of Iraq , Syria or Libya
We are truly in the Last Days. Armageddon is sure to come next.
Look at this even Russians the world the people we are not the cause of war it's these freaking lunatic president politics let's not forget the main evil powers those who fund the wars and make the real calls for war
PRAY FOR WORLD 🌎 PEACE 💙🙏💙🙏💙🙏💙
(Keystone pipeline stoppage in the USA by Biden was intentional) Joe Biden stopped oil & gas production from going to Europe making Europe dependent on Russia's Oil and gas. Now Russia has a strangle hold on European countries. Even Americans rely on oil coming from Russia due to shortage created by Biden.  Joe Biden worked with Russia on this. Don't expect America helping Ukraine. USA (Biden) enabled Russia by making Europe dependent on Russian Oil and Gas. Ukraine is lost as USA and no other country will come to aid Ukraine. Thank you Joe Biden
White vs White... The rest of the world is Waiting for a good show...
One end of Ukraine is very Russian  and the other end very Ukrainian.  If only there was a way of settling this peacefully.   Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God.
Thank you to all the protestors who stood up for peace.   Praying for Russia and the Ukraine.
"The time to buy is when there is blood on the streets"Baron Rothschild, 18th-century
The people of Russia, this is your time to fight for freedom & oust the old grumpy Hitler wannabe who refuses to leave office.  .  .  Russia needs a fresh young mind in Power.  We are with you 🧡
PUTIN is devil barbaric.
This shows that the citizens are all innocent they have nothing to do with the war.the problem is with the government. Poor citizens we are only a canon fodder to them.
Слава Украине!!! Остановить войну.... мы братья   #НетВойны
5 days I researched it and study it my self, very crazy what social media can create on there end, as mom says don’t take candy from a stranger, was on till I started realizing it was no one talking but donations coming into Canada rally, why would you donate if your going to get your account frozen
No more fighting see your own love and sight, don’t hear others opinions or comments, no more hate you all can’t see just one love, is the resolution to all healing, please hear only u as I say, see most people on media is created truly research, plus TikTok just got revamped and a new owner

Looks like canada
Kapag namn walang aksyun ang russia baka sila namn ang maging kawawa . Sa balak ng amerika .
🙏
A modern Hitler.  Sad very sad
Ukrainian people we all love you too World peace we just want happiness
I think we need to get rid of government all over the world because all these politicians are crooks no matter what country they're from.
Somebody has to knockoff that creep. Hopefully his cronies will turn against him  when they lose much of their wealth.
Yeah that looks like the pukin has total support,..
Russia people Thank you our hearts are with you 🥰 here from the world 🌎
Looks like what the Canadian dictator is doing to the peace loving Canadian citizens. Double standard. A dictator  is a dictator!
We need Pussey Riot!
So funny.  The fraud leader in Washington still talking and not doing to help Ukraine?,..,
Brave people
Well done to the Russian people. Hope they can overthrow this government.
Its a big fault of UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT, why you contradict a big country. If the war start your country will become dust. Your country will become a practice and exercising of a new weapon from both BIG RUSSIA, AMERIKA, UK, GERMANY, FRANCE, TURKEY, CHINA,JAPAN,  Dear, Mr. President of UKRAINE.          Down your ego, talk to russia and amerika, dont go to war. Your people and your country will suffer a lot. Dont be stupid.
This guy is a buffoon
we are all brothers!!! make love not war!!! 💞💞💞
The new Hitler has arisen! Putin must be stopped!
The USA is an oligarchy dictatorship country disguised as democracy!
Hooray for people of Russia that fight against this tyrant!!!
Ha sooo democracy is best....
May Allah bless Ukraine.
Putin will burn in hell
There is a solution.. But it would require NATO to do the right thing, and allow the Ukraine to join right now.  The Russians would turn tail and run.
Well people in united state protested against war and Iraq invasion but USA went and destroyed Iraq anyway .
Respect for putin
Good job people of Russia!  We all know this is wrong. Putin may try to justify his greed but the blood is very much on his hands.
Oh just like in Canada
Respect for the Russian people, bring down that KGB tyrant
Soros at work
It’s not the people’s of Russia’s fault ! Don’t blame them ! They’ve been held hostage by Tyrant’s for decades if not centuries ! God be with us all !
That looks like the Canadians and American Citizens being arrested for refusing Vaccine and mask Mandates. So what's new. Stop blaming Russia for doing the same thing you idiots are doing for far less. Mind you damm business.
Looks exactly like the western countries when people protest nowadays. So keep you propaganda to yourself.
THE RUSSIAN RUBLE NOW IS LIKE MICKEY MOUSE MONEY IN VALUE. PUTIN AND HIS BILLIONAIRE CRONIES HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS SINCE THEY HAVE THE ZILLIONS. BUT ORDINARY RUSSIANS MAY NOT AFFORD TO BUY A CUP OF TEA AND A PIECE OF BREAD STARTING TODAY!
1,600 arrested?? Where do you have a building to hold that many
Please Russian take are weak democratic and democratic supporters lol
It is such a painful experience for the Ukrainian people. The Russian dissidents probably suffer more at the hands of the brute that Russia has as their leader.
We should send Nancy Pelosi to Russia she is kryptonite to dictator clowns😎
This is prove that people leave normal becoz of on leader who had a hidden agenda every body will affected
Bravo to the protesters in Russia! Prayers to Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏 ❤ STAY STRONG !!!!
1:25 Balloons:  Putin: you are guilty just as well, Baloons! I will make you pay the way history shall never forget! Balloons:
Wow that was amazing...Russian protesting.  When the US invaded Iraq,,,did any Americans protested?? Were they afraid to be labelled a terrorist and sent to Guantanamo?
He does not have support of people and can not blame them.
This is why Putin is dangerous
I blame everyone who let the democRats steal the election from president Trump for this almost as much as Putin..  Biden showed the world he was totally incompetent the way he withdrew from Afghanistan.  Now Russia is after the Ukraine and China has it's eyes on Taiwan.
Gulingkan aja si putin
This is what politicians will always put us through, but we don't learn, what are we fighting for? Can't the citizens of a nation have a say to what should?.......
Looks like Canada
Seems like the government world wide wants to control the people’s freedom!
Fake news making look like Ukrainian citizens are being killed.
At this point those are some brave reporters too....
PUTIN'S MIDDLE NAME = HITLER! I'M PART UKRAINIAN PRAY FOR THEM..
I love these Russians !!!!  Their president Putin doesn't deserve such wonderful people.  Neither do they deserve such a selfish president!
Ohhhh my goodness..so the dictator have no support for his country?? Putin have a fresh young looking face now..check him after 30days you will see .. this stress is too much to handle.. just wait it'll bite soon😸
It's already 21st century and dictator is still in position to start a war
Putin want to act like second Hitlar it won't happen I pray that there will be peace among the two country..
The Russian people need to overthrow Putin’s regime for the sake of humanity. He is the worst tyrant of the 21st century.
People of Canada should learn from Russian people..  Ashamed to see majority of the Canadians did not supported protesters on  account being freezed whereas Russians  people came out in support of Ukraine people
War must end
I wholeheartedly love and support the Russians boldly protesting this evil tyrant and that they support the Ukrainians. You have my support protesters
Dont pay your taxes to the russian government!
People of Russia will kick putin...
Protesters are paid Cia agents
russian were coming get to hack your systems no electric coming soon
Putin show what kind of leader he is. He idolize Hitler.
Fk them all
His own people need to take Putin out.. now
It's the beginning of the end for Russia and Russians across the world.
Le presiden  russe et le presiden amiricain  tous des criminal  leur mission semi la mort  au peuple innossant et sur tou  les peupel musulmanes
The thing is the leaders sit in office and everyone else fights for their agenda. Most people fighting the wars have nothing against the people they are fighting they are fighting because their president wants something. I think the Russian people realize this and most people fighting each other would be friends if they crossed paths and have no anger against each other. It is never ever about what the people want but only the people suffer.
punk putin a dictator, wasn't that trump chump's friend, lol
The Soviet Union evil empire is baaaack. And Putin ex KGB is the new dictator.  All the Putin fan boys can move to Russia. You will be much happier there.  Putin is your hero.
Well does this seen look familar???? Anyone want to know what it looks like? Looks like the USA but yet it's ok for us to  invade other countries and arrest protestors lol 😆 🤣 😜 😂  we are hipocrits
Brave people facing a monster .
These are paid protesters and traitors to Russia.
I know some Russians and the Russian government lies and manipulates their own people :( good to see some people still see things for how they are. War is NEVER the right thing to do. Putin has toilets made out of gold (literally) and his own people are poverty stricken. He should focus on his own country before trying to abduct another.
No Russian ever removed the post I made online. No Russian ever restricted my social network account. No Russian ever accused me of terrorism and insurrection for peacefully protesting. No Russian ever froze my bank account. No Russian ever created a historical wealth transfer from the lower and middle classes to the upper classes. No Russian ever armed terror groups in Syria that targeted Americans. No Russian ever diluted my vote with fraudulent and illegal ballots cast by non citizens. No Russian ever approved the use of my tax dollars to fund covid gain of function research in a PLA military lab in China. No Russian ever made me a second class citizen in my own country. No Russian ever called me a deplorable. No Russian ever did anything to me.
When nato enters your regions they will spoil your country. Putin already warned not to join nato. Ukraine doesn't listen to that. So it's mandatory for Putin to protect his country. Stop doing protests without knowing about the conflict
Peace no more war
The war will be over by the 2nd of March and it will be all OK again
For those Canadians who are complaining about police brutality in Ottawa, look closely at this video. This is how other countries are treated by their police. So stop crying Canadians. Prayers for the Russian protesters 🙏🏻🇨🇦
Russian people thank you for Loving UKRAINE.lets stand together and destroy Putin and his oligarchs..
Ukraine need the Russian people's support. Go Russians! Tell Putin "NO!"
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Do they think Putin cares about them protesting why are they even bothering.
I was in Russia in October on Putin's birthday about 3 years ago now and on your news you guys are talking about huge antique Russian anti-Putin demonstrations I was in Saint peter'square I have time stamped GPS photos showing there was nobody there at the time you said how do we know this time it's not just some Winter carnival or something else that you're labeling a protest.
Brave Russians, the West does not have ill feelings towards the average Russian, we support you and thank you for speaking out.
Target the family of the policeman, just like they target yours. When they don't value ethics, you should also not.   This will topple the entire police system. Easy win for the people. There are no morals when they don't value your rights
Most of the Russians are good people . Just that bastarized Putin ! I hope he get ties for crimes against humanity !
Stop the War, innocent lives matter, together we can
Thank you God for me being born in the beautiful America.. God please help these innocent people..stop that Putin god.
These dramas of media are just hiding what really caused Putin to decide the war, US is literally expanding its military power by using Ukraine as a pawn to join NATO making US and NATO missiles right at Russia's doorsteps, suppose if Russia makes mexico an ally and mexico have Russian missiles right at US doorsteps, would you think the US would not do the same?
Ppl are just tierd from war hungry politicians! I am happy to see that so many young ppl come on streets and protests against this insane war that Putin has started! Bravo Russian citizens !
What i want to know is.....who's idea was it to put mascara on this man? He has enough makeup as it is.
The Russian people will revolt against puketen  This will not end well for him
Look at these brave Russian people. They Don't want war. Putins Not talking for his people,only his greed.
Should be  anti-Bidey protests   as he promoted, enabled  all this.  Also putting us in the dumper energy wise. Ja?  DA !
Well, they're gonna eat wolves again, soon.
🇪🇺🇪🇺💟💟🍇🍒🍎🇬🇧🇬🇧🇺🇸🇺🇸 Dear Brothers and Sisters in Ukraine,     If you pray to The Single Supreme God of Universe alone and defend the aggression against your country, God will give you the eternal - glorious - purest - luxurious 'Eden Garden' (The Paradise of Heaven).  May God (Allah) save you and your loving people from 'Gog  Magog'.  You will reunite with your loving family members in Heaven by God grace.  Dears,      This is the happy news to live with the most beautiful, the whitest and most loving 'Heavenly cheering spouses' in the eternal - glorious - purest - luxurious Eden Garden (Paradise of Heaven).      There will have rivers and gardens.There will have  tents made by giant single pearl (bored pearl) and beds raised high in Heaven .  Trunks of all trees in Heaven made by gold.  There will have very huge shade trees in Heaven with golden trunks .  Dears,      The shortest way to return to Heaven is to 'worship the Lord of the universe' alone, pray to him alone and do good deeds with human love. (The effort to defend the aggression against your country and against your people is a good deed infront of The God)   Kindly read this message completely and follow it. This may be a great opportunity in your life.  By this life in this earth we must realize the power and wisdom of our creator.  According to religious scriptures, 'The Single Supreme Lord of the Universe' created the colossal Universe and Earth. And also 'The God' created an eternal - pure - glorious - luxurious Paradise of Heaven for us.  Heaven will be very different from our earth. Heaven is made by gold, silver,  pearls and other precious materials.  All who have reached Heaven from this earth will be transformed into the most beautiful and the whitest 'Heavenly people'.  In addition 'The God' created the most beautiful, the whitest , purest and most loving 'Heavenly cheering girls' as wives (as girl friends) in Heaven.  'Heavenly peoples' will be sitting face to face with their friends on the 'Heavenly silky sofas' in Heaven and the fruits of the gardens will be near at hands.  Heavenly girls will sing beautiful songs.  In Heaven  'Heavenly women' will use  'eye shadow'  and they will not have 'body hair'.  Even the hair (head hair) straightening comb of Heavenly women would be made of gold.  When the inhabitants of Heaven reach in Heaven, the female believers  from this earth will be above  hundred  times beautiful than the  'Heavenly Girls'.  There is no urination nor excrements nor any bad smells nor spit nor mucus nor saliva nor menses nor any other body wastes in Heaven.  After consuming the Heavenly foods, drinks and fruits in Heaven, it goes out from the 'Heavenly human body' as 'fragrant sweat' and that spread in 'surrounding air' as fragrances .  Heaven will mesmerise human minds by all means .  After our death we must return to Heaven with our parents, sisters, brothers and loving family members.  The shortest way to return to Heaven is to 'worship the Lord of the universe' alone, pray to him alone and do good deeds with human love.   This is the only way to Heaven that the prophets followed.  The names Allah, 'The God', Yahweh, Hiranyagarbha and Jagadeeshwar are the names given to the 'Single Supreme Lord of the universe' in different languages.   Moses, Abraham, Jesus, Isaac, David, Solomon, Muhammad and Mary prayed to the 'One and Only Lord of the universe' alone.   This way of Prophets is enough for entire humanity to return to Heaven.            The name 'Allah'  for 'The Single Supreme Lord of the universe' is a great and meaningful name in Arabic language.  May 'The Single Supreme God Allah' bless you and  guide you to  'The Paradise of Heaven'.      We must not neglect the path to Heaven shown by   Muhammad, Jesus,  Moses and Sree Kreshna .  The most richest, the most  powerful and the 'most merciful God' need nothing  more from us than worship  him alone, pray to him alone, do good deeds with human love and keep justice .  Never lose Heaven by worshipping other beings instead of the 'Single Supreme God Almighty'.  We must reach Heaven. If we lose Heaven,  it will be great sorrow, great mental pain and also we will fall into the Hell fire.   Hell fire is dangerous and pain full.  Never pray to Muhammed nor Jesus  nor Sree Kreshna nor Buddha nor Ali nor Fathima nor Soofi nor person in graveyard nor idol nor snakes nor cow nor sun nor moon nor fire.        Jesus or Sree Kreshna or Buddha or Ali didn't told humans to pray to them nor they claimed themselves as they are Gods.        Learn more about    Listen AbduRaheem Green in You Tube.    Kindly visit Facebook account ' Muhammad Azgar '.  Visit website "Islam house"    Kindly call your loving peoples and friends to this way of think.  God bless you and guide you to Heaven .   Thanks dears.🍒🌹🌹🌹🥀
Very courageous protesters indeed, as they know the consequences they face. Even if Putin isn't Stalin of course (I heard a former NATO secretary general make this rather odd remark that Putin is a 'Stalinist') Frankly, I'm afraid the West can't do much more than sanctions, and these might take long before they might have some effect. Although I'm sure Putin has a fat piggybank and Chinese commercial support. The European countries are already not uni sono about Swift, the Indians are apparantly reluctant to join the pressure etc. It's but a small fist which has been made, and Moscow still has to announce counter-sanctions, which will hurt the weakest Western economies a lot. So they will want "compensations" from the richer countries, who might or might not agree with them. This is going to be quite a "test for the West". And frankly, I don't think Putin will be political past by 2026. Unless the billionaires in Russia get somewhat tired of his international adventures. But Putin has the former KGB machine behind him.... And I'm not sure Biden has what it takes to challenge him succesfully. Damned, I wonder to what this will all lead....
Only the rich want to go to war
A glimmer of light in a dark time. Thank you to the people of 🇷🇺 for speaking out. Let your voice be known, we want peace !
Respect to the Russian protestors.
May the good hearted Russians unite.
VERY same thing going on in Ottawa. Protesters handled EXACTLY the same....EXACTLY.
Those Russian demonstrators put to shame the Westerners that rejoice at the war and love Putin so much.
I think we’re all sick of war and abuse globally from these pigs who guise as leaders
The president vladímir Putin is the most devil person...... 🙏🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦all my prays are with Ukranie 🙏🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦👍
Yeah, a war that every member of Russian parliament authorized. Mr. Putin didn't do this alone. These protesters are mostly foreign incited by NGOs, as usual.
We are one life long we are one who who accepting truth and dare we better focus on how to create peace in every inch of our land
Thank you Russians for standing up against Putin.
1000000000000 protesters 😂😂😂😂😂
Although I don’t condone riots but when it comes to situations like this against tyranny then I bet those people would riot against the police to stop this war
Putin is like Hitler
Putin is a dinasour from an old age of bully governments and self apointed kings. The Russian people deserve better that an oppresive dictator holding them back from prosperity while his friends live off the sweat of everyone else. Perhaps Russia needs "Liberating". God Bless them!
Better watch out youll get yourself on the list. Go Home!
Western media hidings truth 😂😂😂
The Russian people can still change the course of history. Russian and Ukrainian are blood brothers. They may choose cultural and trade ties. But killing innocent people is the worst crime Putin has committed to this day. Russian people wake up please and demand peace in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people have been living a normal peaceful life till a few days ago. Do not fall for Putins propaganda machine. Please please wake up.  Your resistance in Jesus mighty name can stop the bloodshed of pregnant women, babies,  children, young innocent adolescents, young men and women and the older generation , the sick... It is about humanity.
Hahaha does are just a hand full of Russians dramatic man.
Putin is the root of all of this
Keep protesting  Russian  people
Putins crackdown of peaceful protesters kind of reminds me of Trudeaus crackdown of Canadian truckers. Ukraine shouldn't worry though, Biden will put sanction on banks. Yeah, that will stop Russia. If Biden wasn't so weak, Putin would not have dared attack Ukraine. Unfortunately, because everyone saw Biden's chaotic and embarrassing defeat in Afghanistan, Putin concluded Biden would be weak and not help Ukraine when Ukraine needed help the most, and encouraged Russian aggression.
Putin: seems like i have to nuke my own people too.
Well done Russian People. Be strong and take down this Hitler of 21st.
Stop the war
Russian police=facism bully's, same with trump's go figure
God bless the Russian,people brave enough to do this. In your hands are the future of ukraine and world
HEROES!
Russia stop invading and killing people  unconditional now
1.600 Russians were imprisoned because of this? How big is the prison? Get it full!!!!
Western media is BS 🤣
Americans are with everyone who stands against Putin!! Russians and Ukrainians!
God bless the real russian people who want peace not war ,MAY GOD WATCH OVER THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE, PUTIN IS NOTHING BUT SATANS LITTLE HELPER,
This is why police should never be like the military..?..
No Need for Price Hikes Lately, headlines have been warning that prices are about to go up. The price of many commodities has already started rising and pundits alert that this is only the beginning. “Unilever warns of more price hikes as inflation worsens,” writes Reuters. “As Inflation Persists, Everything Is Getting More Expensive,” echoes The New York Times. “Fed to begin slowing economic aid as inflation worries rise,” warns the Los Angeles Times. Everyone has become gloom and doom prophets, but no one is asking why there should be inflation in the first place. Commentators on all news outlets explain that shortage of computer chips, jams in supply chains, rising oil prices, and a spike in consumer demand following the termination of the closures are all contributing to the price hikes. I think we should not be so credulous; behind all those “crises” are people poised to make billions over billions at our expense. They will not starve us; starving people doesn’t create revenue for tycoons. To keep padding their bank accounts, magnets will give us crumbs here and there to keep us going. They won’t deny us food or electricity, or other staples, as this would send people to the streets, which is bad for business. What they will do is stretch the wire thin until it almost snaps, and squeeze from us as much as they can without crossing over to riots and mayhem. We might think that if someone else were in charge, things would be better. We might elect a new president, force the government to “regulate” the rich or tax them, but it is all for nothing. In order to get to the top, you have to be like the people at the top, but worse, or they will crush you. As a result, anyone who gets to the top is already willing to perpetuate the system. Moreover, we the people have been numbed for so many years that we can no longer imagine a different life than what we have. We have been made to think that life is a struggle for survival. All the while, the chiefs are running a completely different life than ours, one we cannot even imagine. In their parallel universe, which governs ours, money doesn’t buy gadgets or vacations, but power, control, and much more money. But there is one thing that money cannot buy, and it is not love. Money can’t buy meaning! When we begin to ponder the meaning of the rat race, the reason for the madness we call “civilization,” and indeed, the meaning of life itself, we will transcend all physical boundaries. For now, the inequality and injustice that are spreading through society are only aggravating our misery. Eventually, they will force us to ask what it is all for. When this happens, we will begin to learn why we are here and how we can rise above the physical shells that host our tormented souls.. We will not begin this process of self-education until we feel that we have suffered enough. It is therefore my hope that we will decide to terminate this senseless ego-game and start rising above the power struggles as soon as possible. Once we embark on the new journey, we will discover that we have been deluding ourselves the whole time thinking that we can rise above others. We will discover that we are all connected, so every time we hurt someone, we hurt ourselves, as well, in ways we could not notice. This is why in our previous mode of work, we could never be happy. We will realize that we can be happy only when everyone is happy, just as no part of the body can feel good unless the whole body feels good. Our biggest enemy is ignorance. Our obliviousness to our interconnectedness makes us act in the selfish ways we do, so our first and most important task is to grasp that pain anywhere is pain everywhere. Only if we understand this, we will act in a considerate manner, and we will suddenly discover that there is no need for any price hikes, there is no shortage of anything, but rather abundance of everything that we might need to give us a good, secure, and happy life.
Does Russian police  consider themselves heroes?
Peace LOVE not WAR...
Every country where US is present, Crisis would happen. Next will be Taiwan. If you're being puppet by USA and its NATO, you have no freedom to strengthen your military.
Vladdy daddy
Very small proportion of population is protesting, we all know how this works.
Fake newd
More more more
Yes I believe you news person. You are my friend and would never lie to me.
Warning from Holy Bible to Humans:- The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand, please repent from all your sins before Lord Jesus Christ, thou shalt be saved and thy family members from eternal Hell to eternal Heaven Amen 🙏🙏🙏
These protesters are our allies in Russia.
Russian soldiers and Russian pilots “just following orders” and murdering Ukrainian people.
Trudeau in CANADA does the same to Truck Drivers
And you’re gonna believe the Kremlin you are as naïve as a guy reporting  the news
Putin will always and forever remain a brute and a bully, that's how history gonna judge him in years to come, he earned it !
What  happened  to  war lovers  of  the  West!
“STOP THE WAR!!”
Right on I guess the KGB is on full alert
Strength to these people fighting for humanity.
LOL the footage of the protestors being taken away looks like us in the USA. US CITIZENS get taken away the same way by cops haha we must look horrible as well to other countries
We'll done Russian people 👍🤟
Bout fukn time Russia !  Love you right now !  Stay strong  !!  I'm a U.S. citizen  and only want peace for the rest of my life and everyone's lives
Oh you mean like our Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. , Libya, Korea, panama
Thank you Russian people for caring about no War
Russian Cops look like Ottawa Police......
Senseless violence
When a repuclic  turns into a democracy your only 1 step away from tyrants its a cycle  that never ends ..""plato"" the book
Они правы, проблема в российских политиках, а не в Украине.
Where are ecologists now? Just pretending.
Putin well done!We are people of Russia elected Putin. He is our choice. Putin, go destroy Ukrainian nazzi!!
Peace 🙏
Please Tovarisch Putin! All of us still reeling from 2 years of pandemic!. Remember your history! Please stop this!!
Ukrainian so called government is a puppet made of punch Comedian actors.
I stand with Ukraine
Arrest Putin!
When you look at the Evils of Russia you really understand why NATO was so necessary. Because what the Hell is Russia
Thank you for protesting in  Russia regarding the invasion of Ukraine !  You guys are very brave .
Thank you Russia! You are not Putin and Putin is not Russia! 🇷🇺🇺🇦
Hey to Canadians, this is what a tyrannical government is morons. Not the “emergency act”.
That's is the best way to people of Russia to protest in ousted Pres.putin to his post if he don't like War.all Russian General or military must must think don't obey to to Pres.putin to make war.because their family will also affected by War.Put Pres Putin in jail.because he is already crazy.
stupid communist regime
러시아인들을 미워할수만은 없네 사람바이사람이네
Russia willl all be hurting, sir. Does not mean mean we won't. Because they are not NATO. No counties before WW2. The U.S, and allies, not afraid of any one or even two countries, at all. Would Chinese or Russia really attack America? Not at all. 😂🤣😂🤣 Even attacking Alaska,  a population that has an average of 5 guns per person, the military has the best weapons in the world. How do I know? My job as USAF. Trying to come in there, your death. Not just by military, just people there in general. They have lots of gun makers, gun dealers, specializing bullet makers(I can tell you some that are horrific rounds) Invading Alaska not happening. Not Russia, or China. Will never happen again in the Aleutians.
Russian version  Of america's vietnam anti war rally
THANK YOU TO RUSSIANS WHO PROTEST AGAINST THE WAR.  SHAME ON YOU PUTIN
hmm just like Canada
Thank you Russian for being brave God protects you. You show your love to Ukraine and the whole world!
Геббельсовская пропаганда западных сми
When soldiers are fighting and dying here Putin sitting and enjoying life to it's fullest nice one..............
Putin's fears are valid that NATO is there at his borders but war on sovereign independent Ukraine is not answer. Russian people should rise up and through out tyrant Putin.
Respect
May they all be safe. Such sad times. ✌️ please prevail
The fall of Putin...😏
НЕТ ВОЙНЕ. МИР. ДРУЖБА. БРАТСТВО.
Only a few. No one cares. When US and NATO started bombing Middle East, thousand American and European also protested in Street but no one cares.
STAY STRONG FREEDOM FIGHTERS ACROSS THE WORLD ✨⚡✨💪⚡✨❤️🙏🔥💥
Why why why????? Let the war continue man!!!🔫💪🏻🇷🇺… these people are so dumb
These Russians know the consequences that war may bring on them, there are no winners in war.
Good for them but won't be long until they all get arrested...
Why do these idiots have to protest!?!?!?!? Let the war continue man! 💪🏻🔫
Brave people who came out to protest against Putin. Putin Go back. India should take a firm stand on any aggression whether it is China, Russia.
IF ENOUGH PEOPLE N TRUCKERS OF RUSSIA BAN 2GETHER RIGHT NOW PUTIN WOULD HAVE TO DRAW BACK HIS FORCES TO PROTECT MOTHER RUSSIA OR IF OTHER COUNTRIES INVADED RUSSIA THAT WOULD B WORSE
Good people still exist!!! Fight the good fight protestors!!! Only the wicked war and when they are all fighting eachother, they will have to fight against my fathers forces when he arrives.. I hope they had enough training 🤣 🤣 🤣   Isaiah 2:4 "4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."
We people are in peace. We people are more united as a family around the world. We people of all nation holds love and care for each other. It's the politicians people got problems having hates, selfishness, greed with no soul. They are the problems making the world look bad. This is why we should not slave, or work for them to make them stay in power. If the politicians have problems, let them fight each others. So that they will know how it feels to sacrifice your life. Drop all all your weapons and live day to day normal life and to be with your families and friends. Life is to short.
Brave Russians. God bless you all.
Dear Russians, maybe its time to get nasty in your protests and take Putin down. A mess yes, but your leader is a mad tyrant and needs to be stopped.
Nobody wants this.  My hat is tipped to those people in Russia standing up for what's right.
Biden liked to Ukraine in exchange for payout to him and Hunter...lol. They believed Biden would protect them.
In Western countries there were greater numbers of protestors fighting against virus mandates than there are anti war protestors in Russia.
This is how common good can be achieved.For realising the common good one must be well educated and rational in his thinking. Education is power 💓. #stopwar. #peace.
Search YouTube for J Bravo
Where all the assassins when you need them i would love to just see puttin get sniped while giving a speech
This reminds me of anti truckers protests. The 0.001% of those that don’t support it lol. Media has no problem making them look like a big group. 90% of Russians agree with Putin so does a lot of the world. Only not nato of course because their horrible plan to get closer to Russia failed. Why would any Russian in their right mind want nato forces parked on their border just because the country that speaks same language and has same people technically, decides to join Russias #1 enemy. What do they expect? That Russia will just sit there and welcome nato? Would you welcome Russia to Mexico and have their troops linger there? Hypocrites. As much right as Ukraine has, on paper, unfortunately that’s not the reality. They’re still minority with weak economy. They can’t dictate what state Russia will be in. They called for this. Unfortunately it’s poor civilians that have to suffer the consequences. This is not putins fault. This is the fault of America and Ukraine
No war!!!! No nukes!!!!
Oh look, no one is burning things like antifa and BLM.
Why is no one on here ask what did Putin want? What was he asking for and was denied? Makes me wonder ill have to check and see what he was asking for...
Real Hero's👍👍👍
shame on u , putin!
Soros supporters  Look again all young BEZDELNIKI  BRAVO RUSSIA 🇷🇺
Yes no matter race creed color or country, ordinary people do not want war NO WAR
May God bless and protect theses brave Russian people...and may God bring peace to the people of Ukraine
The disastrous food partially expand because crush neurochemically spark over a naive february. elfin, agreeable chain
For any Ukrainian reading this, you totally deserve this beating from Russia. For the past 6 years, your puppet government has been shelling innocent civilians in Donbass. The world is sick of the western double standard bull s**t. Both Donetsk and Lugansk are pro Russia, isn't the west pro democracy? you want democracy? you've got it!! GO RUSSIA! GO PUTIN!
Those are probably Ukrainian demonstrators in Moscow and St. Petersburg, there are almost 4 million Ukrainian living in Russia.
Ukrainian insurgents can take the war to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Minsk by carrying out terrorist (car bomb, arson, subway, refinery, and airline, etc.) attacks on military targets and on the Russian population in this pending guerilla war. **************************************************************************************************************
Ha Putin one more thing. Those that are watching your military work will analyze conditions that will work against your mighty armed force at some point. You have watch the American military in past years but then not much changes other than technology on the battlefield. The U.S. military would do total damage to your military might even without technology that is superior to your military and I will tell you why. If you are at first a tyrant then you shall always be and tyrant that all people can see and that is your citizens also. That is why you would lose even if the U.S. didn't have superior weapon systems. You have nuclear bombs that keep you from facing your crimes putin. YOu and your cronies.
Us help ukrain. Us send nuclear to Russia
This is so awesome to see. So much respect to the Russian people.
Dear God, Please have mercy on us All. Let these dark times stop! Please show extra favor to those protestors that had the courage to show up. In Jesus name I pray- Amen.
All of these people on the street are not just protesting, they come to the streets ready to go to jail or even be killed, this is not that easy, everyone is scared now. My respect and support.
You got the dogs barking putin.now jump the fence.
This is what happens when a tyrant runs your country. People who run against you in the "elections" get disappeared, and war happens despite what the people want. It's sickening.
These r the real human beings who has a heart for their ukrainian brothers n sisters. Putin is inhumane.
battle of media at war
Wah oooww that USA punished Russia Iran China for years and u r now protesting for some money against ur ownself and the government ? Wah Mr Putin should follow Korean government  rules and teach their ppl some manners
I am so proud of those Russian protesters🥺❤...the world knows that not all Russians want this war. Stay strong
While the so called freedom champions in US n Europe are still silent on killing and displacing of millions in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya.
I'm so happy the Russian people are protesting I was wrong about them 👏
Go go protestor kick out ur presedent
MR Putin you are supported by HELL
Why the presedent of rassia .. can't speak English my hole
Normal people can find a way to live in peace. It's the politicians who can't stand each other.
Russia??? Looks like scenes from Canada to me. Same type of government abuse on its own people.
i hate this war, and everything it represents.  and, it's not about taking sides.  it's about knowing what is right from wrong.  death is surely wrong.  death in the cause of Russian nationalism is surely wrong.  killing your brothers, by branding them terrorists is surely wrong.  God was upset at Kane for killing Abel, wasn't He? - then you know, by your own religion, it is wrong! - wtf.
It's deep
🤗💙👍 Thank you for demonstrating against the evil communist Putin 👹💀🤬
Protest is not enough.
*Putin evil mind attacks ukraine civilians in their sleep like a chicken coward and imprisoned his people for the right to freedom protesting against war.Say no to putin's criminal*
Free  Navalny  , put in jail Poutain ( son of a B) instead .
*Путинская злоба нападает на мирных жителей Украины во сне, как куриный трус, и сажает в тюрьму свой народ за право на свободу, протестуя против войны. Скажи нет путинскому преступнику*
Да ни хрена у вас матрасники не получится.
Stop war
And this right here is why I dont hate Russia, or the Russian people, or the Russian military.  I hate the one man that thinks he can control them all.
So much respect for those protestors. They know full well that they’re putting their lives at risk
The new hitler
Why wars???? just I don’t get it🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ The people suffer from both sides
Was this video from Canada or Russia I can’t tell
I don't believe anything CNBC has to say
Gulag is ready for this anti-war protestors
Smart people from russia doing there own research on the situation. Americans should do there research as well when ever the u.s bombs another country. Its more to the story than local news. Alot of corruption.
Libertad para Rusia  Sacar a Putin y a su camarilla del poder  Volverse un país democrático
Even brought the balloons with the arrested
As usual USA & NATO ditched UKRAIN Biden miscalculated RUSSIA they thought it will be like IRAQ IRAN SYRIA LIBYA NO Mr BIDEN OR USA THIS TIME ITS RUSSIA and now onwards your superiority is over you are nothing
US hypocrites. Keep saying Article 5 of NATO but now that Ukraine is attacked then just give sanctions? What's the use of those sanction if Ukraine is destroyed?  US must be blamed why this war is happening.
I'm sure two out of three Russians have relatives that live in Ukraine
This broadcast is pure propaganda. The protests are George Soros incarnate. Do not believe Shep Smith.
Trump: Let's storm the capital   Putin: Hold my vodka      But seriously 💙💛
Thank you to our brothers and sisters in RUSSIA  for standing up for Ukraine .To our brothers and sisters in UKRAINE the world is with you stay strong
Russian people are going to be the only ones that can stop this. Remove your dictator
He is a criminal. Step him down.
This was preventable if Ukrainian President had given a guarantee that no NATO missiles would be installed at Russian door step, otherwise  this situation was inevitable after an elected Ukrainian  President was overthrown by the mobs in 2014. To find a solution we have to understand why this happened . PRAY FOR  PEACE.
They can't arrest millions od people, they dont want war.
*JESUS CHRIST WILL FILL YOUR VOID , AMÉM,.*
Trump  1.peace with N Korea 2.Serbia-kosovo deal 3.No new wars 4.UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, Morocco recognised Israel Biden 1.Taliban occupied Afghanistan 2.Terrorists using usa weapons left in Afghanistan against India 3. Failed to resolve Russia Ukrain crisis  We did it,Joe!
kOMTOL
This is what putin fear the Russian people standing up against him.
I am so proud of the decent Russian people.   And the thieving greedy Oligarchs in London must be sent home immediately. Putin had hundreds of choices. Putin is following the Globalist's orders.  Putin is another puppet of the Globalist's.
Il dois sûrement avoir une autres solutions que de faire la guerre ?
Lies the Russian people don't like the so called president Putin
This Just  confirm that is war is a One man operation and the people do not accept this type of barbaric action
We Are brothers! I am sorry for loss of Ukrainian and Russian  life.!
These protesters  are just 1% of Russian  population 😳.  West media boosted them.
The people should have the. Vote...what to do...not that monster
What is 1600 ukrainians protesting in Russia nothing ....
Outs Putin...
The antichrist is pro war The Truth says love your enemy
Keep fighting Putin, Russians! Everyone is sick of government corruption. The world is tired. Keep pushing back. Good for you!!
Dont back down! Keep doing what your doing. 🇺🇲
Sadly the Russian people will suffer for years to come after what there Nazi leader has done here.  Ukraine 🇺🇦 Stay strong!
OK you realize how big Russia really is and then you look at how small comparatively the crowds of people that have gathered makes you think about things clear mental sane thoughts , this is hardly a fraction of the people that live in Russia I’d say a good 75 to65 maybe just speculating,Percent of the population are down for the war…😶, other percentages being people that don’t want war of course👍
On the edge of WW3. Hope peace for Ukraine people. We don't want ww.
Why drug Ur own people to war for your own ego not knowing what is in store for you.
#STOPTHISWAR #BACKOFFPUTIN #FREEUKRAINE
Well the window is closing fast for them, from this point on Russians are not welcomed anywhere in the world for a while regardless. They need to start by hanging Putin like Iraqis did with Saddam, then and only then can they be welcomed back to the world.
You just can’t take a country. 🤷🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Wish we saw these kinds of arrests last year during Antifa in our Country. That would have stopped the riots!
In the end of the day twenty thousands protesters out of 160 millions of population technically Putin has the support of vas majority of the Russian citizens 🤷🏻
Putin=Hitler
Stand Strong Ukraine 🇺🇦 We are with you, and the force of God is with you. I’m praying 🙏🏽
Imagine if we did like crazy extremist conservatives said and sanctioned them earlier: Pooptin would have used that to say, “See, see, it’s USA attacking us.  We must invade,” and likely these protesters wouldn’t be out and would support Pooptin more.  We might even have lost support of Germany since they were so 50/50 due to Russian oil and was looking for excuses.  And India is still 50/50 and likely would have gone 100% helping Russia.  I didn’t expect anything from Biden, but he’s actually played chess while Pooptin playing checkers.  If Pooptin is concerned about his legacy, he’s just guaranteed that he will be infamous and whispered along with names of Hitler, Osama Bin Laden.  God’s safety and blessings for Ukrainian peoples and brave Russian peace-loving protesters.
Peace not war
Make Love Not War✌️☮️
We are all citizens of the earth so the entire world should come together and protest against war this is what the elites does put us against each other so they can keep control of the mass we all came and see  this beautiful planet so it's not own by anyone we just need to live as one in peace, love and unity.
Support Ukraine against NAZI Putin of Russian.   God bless all of Ukrainian.
Fake news from dummy channel
Mantap hancurkan ukraina karena bandel ingin gabung sama nato amerika

RUSSIAN MILITARY CAN TURN THEIR BACK AGAINST THEIR EVIL LEADER. THEY THEMSELVES KNOW IN THEIR HEARTS THAT KILLING OTHERS IS JUST WRONG….. THAT IS WHAT SATAN WANTS YOU TO DO.

Russian people have the power to overrun state police!! we are against war! we are against Putin!
This couldn't be clearer. The people on either side do not want this war. This is the government's agenda and not for the people.
Don't fall for western propaganda....

Thanks to the Russian people that do understand the importance humanity has a great value anywhere in the world. Any  human power if becomes cause human suffering to achieve more must power is despicable and must be removed from power.
Everyperson in all countries need to do this . All of us . Why would we want war why don't we have a world government?! We need to be focusing on our planet and fixing this problem . When we are at war with the most powerful force known to us( the climate and mother nature) why are we so focused on these meaningless wars ?

Can't believe the police would stop them, respect to the citizens

We, human, men, women, children all need resections - the root for good relationship and health.  Sincerely Thank You.
He would have stopped at Luhansk, Donetsk, and accepting for negotiations is right stand  but he is trying to took control of Ukrein,  that's not goog for humanity,  where this ends?, how Many killings have to took place,?  how much Violence has to took place?. Putin going in wrong way , Dialogue for stopping Ukrein only from not taking NATO membership can be justified, but Killing Ukrein people,  Crushing it's pride is 100% Wrong
Lets hope these protests spread #standwithukraine
Why war because of use legs everywhere in the world 🌎 it’s old fight USA don’t let people live they want more more oil and money and gold so they can do what they like
Yay freedom of nooz.
Sadly, all people arrested will face the firing squads.

Good to see the Russian public raising their voices against this war!
The best thing that could happen to Russia is getting rid of Putin and his KGB clan

"Live for yourself, you will live in vain. Live for others, you will live again."  Pass it on.  Micahyah 4:1-3  1 But in the Last Days it will come to pass that the mountain; promotion, of The House of Yahweh will be established in the chief of the nations. It will be raised above all congregations; and all peoples will eventually flow to it.  2 And many nations will come and say; Come, and let us go up to the mountain; uplifting, of Yahweh, and to the House of the Father of Yaaqob, and He will teach us of His Ways, and we will walk in His Paths. Because the Laws will depart from Zion, and the Word of Yahweh from Yerusalem.  3 And He will judge between many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks. Nation will not lift up a sword against nation, nor will they learn war anymore.  Sometimes we take for granted the life we have here as we are distracted by things that pollute our minds more than cleanse them. The sun rises each day and the moon provides light for the darkness, these two simple facts carry an abundance of love not only for the world in which those things were made for but also everything that is here. Us. Everything. The world continues on and on, with or without us. It's cycle continues and continues and it never stops. This world is a creation that is in perfect harmony with itself and that harmony never ceases, that is love for the world and its life. We are flesh, nevertheless the complexity of our bodies and how they work day in and day out, giving us what we need, taking out what we don't need, and also in a continual cycle just as the universe around us is, in love until there is no breath of life for our bodies of course. And who provides that breath of life? The Father that sits in Heaven. We are forever. We were created with love and care as was this world and thats something amongst many other things that shouldn't be forgotten as we are born into this world that is oversaturated with meaningless things that occupy our minds, things that stem from evil for the only purpose of distracting us from the wonder and beauty that life really holds. All the media, fear, negativity, vanity, it does absolutely nothing for us but spread corruption on ourself if we pay mind to it. That all means nothing but darkness and corruption and is brought to us by evil. Nonetheless, Light and darkness were created because you were created to learn these things; peace and destruction were created because you were created to learn these things. Behold! It has come to pass that all these things were done. Drop down, you heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down Righteousness. Let the earth be released; let Salvation spring up, and let Righteousness grow together. Yahweh has declared it! Let go of vanity. We gotta choose life in the face of it, we gotta choose to pay attention to life rather than the darkness that is meant to take away life and our appreciation towards it. The grace of life in front of us is what should be consumed, the sympathy to help others feel good about life. We gotta have an outlook of love and understanding for the world because thats what we don't have much of, love and understanding. We have division because of greed and greed because of lack of love and lack of love because of power that is exhibited in vain, without love. But love is harmony. The creation of the universe has been in harmony since the beginning. So we must become one, we must harmonize with the world each day with gratitude for it and care for all. The division of color is a man made idea which has been allowed to flourish by the wrongdoings and outlooks of man. The disharmony of mankind is the "glitch in the matrix", a lack of faith which in turn makes one weak in the face of evil causing the battle between light and dark. We can alter the mishap of allowing evil to speak or act for us which has lead us to the darkness we see today in this world. There is no benefit on the path that is dark, only misguidance and deceitful emotion.  You are loved, even if you may not  realize it. The world around you loves you each day, even if the world around us doesn't want us, we are loved by what it provides by Him, because we are here for His Loving Plan, not anyone else's. So spread love without looking for reward and resist evil, so that we all may have harmony with one another, in love and understanding. Love your neighbor and do unto another as you would like done unto you, no matter who it is. Live in joy for the memories of those that have passed. Love your Creator, always and give thanks to the Father who sits in heaven, always. Spread love and His truth that is His light, and resist the adversary, always.   All of us have the Most High in us, TAP IN, HEED HIM. Light and darkness, good and evil, love and hate, these things and more were created so that we may know and learn of these things. So we may know the evil sin brings and also the good righteousness brings so that we may find the strength in reflection, through Faith, to turn away from evil and be better to others when we speak and act, to realize the only path and purpose we were created for, for the Plan of the Creator of everything, in Righteousness and Compassion. And all good things come from Yahweh, so you must reverence if you will. When the end comes soon and a new beginning is nigh', will there be forgiveness and mercy for you? I ask myself the same question and yet I do know, His mercy and everlasting love is on me as I am able to sleep a good night and awake to another day in this life with the capability to love, and the capability to have faith, and the blessed feeling of loving the beauty the Heavenly Father has created in this world. Despite our past, through His son, Yahshua Messiah and in truth, we are born again and set free! We are passing through life, not time, but we all must suffer for a time, so wake up today, love the day, live for the Father, one day at a time, no matter the matter, let's do our best and stay in faith, keep His Commandments, studying and learning more of Him so that we are ready for His banquet when He comes. He will pick you right back up if you are down, trust that even in the toughest of times, He is there with you to build you up better than you were before. No need to fret, no matter the matter, in patient endurance and trust in Him, we are made pure and of the light with the undeserved forgiveness upon us, we can turn from evil and be protected under his wings. Be aware of the times we are in, let His Spirit be your guide and let the Spirit be your strength, that is, His Holy Spirit, stay true and do not be provoked to the point of regret. Remember that and let love flow. Protect and feed the children and the poor. Man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Creator! Those that have ears to hear, let them hear! Those that have eyes to see, let them see! Turn to the Messiah, the One He has sent, for through Him, all evil is destroyed! Do not be subject to lies and deceit, do not be a crash test dummy in their operations of deceit in trying to stick man made fluids into our flesh, there is only Salvation in Yahweh, through Yahshua Messiah and the Holy Spirit! There is only Salvation and Power in Yahweh and nothing can deliver us from death, and from death INTO LIFE except Yahweh! Turn away from doing evil, In all things you do reverence the Source of the Creation and do all things with love and righteousness for the Glory of the Creator(not the glory of men) and the Glory due to Him, do so through the example set by His Son Yahshua Messiah and live with the Holy Spirit within.  May YaHWeH bless your understanding and through His Son, Yahshua Messiah, may you all find truth in the past away from deceit, lies and willful ignorance so that we may experience His love, blessings and mercy and His only truth, forever. We don't have much time here to see, hear and wake up. Ignorance is not bliss for that "bliss" that comes from ignorance is an illusion and therefore, an imagination of happiness that stems from the branch of the evil one. There is man, and there is woman, know our place on this earth mankind! The philosophies that are flipping the world upside down today are wrong and immoral. Don't let them compromise originality in us. Do not forget where you have came from, do not forget the Source of all life and the mercy and gift of Salvation that is upon us for He wants you to be saved, reverence His Loving Name. Peace be unto you all. Choose life and love life, also honor those who have passed by living and serving others in happiness and righteousness, for by serving others, we serve The Heavenly Father, and by choosing to embrace life rather than the things that take away life, we grow in His love and ever closer to His Plan that has been established since the very beginning. All Glory be to Yahweh through His Son, Yahshua Messiah, the High Priest and King of Kings, who willingly suffered death for the purpose of bringing Salvation to the people of the world! The House of Yahweh is here, and it will never cease from living. The key to love is understanding. Be wary of deceit, be wary and love Him so that you may be able to discern right from wrong. Serve Him by serving others and do not be subject to the philosophies filled with deceit of the men of this age, do not be deceived by the Vatican. The masonic order is in quick sand and will crash very soon. Israyl and Yahdah will be renewed. His Laws, Statutes and Commandments are to be heeded and loved. Come soon, Yahshua Messiah! All Praise and Glory be to the Heavenly Father, Yahweh! Reverence His loving Name, HALLELUYAHWEH!  Malakyah/"Malachi" 4:1-6 !! Revelations 9 Revelation 16:1-2 !!  Coronavirus, 1 of the last 7.

I am eat my dinner, I am watching you.  I am crying,   my tears follow your blood.   PEACE， NO HURT,  PLEASE 🙏  PLEASE .    We all can be honored by kind and mercy Naturally.   Thank you for bring peace, deliver  peace, and sustain peace  in the world history.    Sincerely.
These are incredibly brave Russian protesters who are risking their lives to stand up for what’s right and say no to war. All 1700 of the arrested protesters are heroes. ☮️🕊
Putin needs to go NOW .
Respect, Admiration & Blessings to the people of Russia who are protesting against the war with Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏. putin is a psychopath,  he is SICK, that's why he is a bully and abuse people, he had No right to invade Ukraine. THE WORLD MUST PROTECT UKRAINE 🇺🇦 🙏 🙏 🙏.  MAY PEACE PREVAIL 🙏 🙏 🙏
Putin should not behave as brain gone fellow and should not come to the position as death of Putin is the  only salvation to this problem, because all the going to dead people's life is equal to Putin's life.  Over aggressive nature took control over Putin's mind. And no Russian is wanting Annexing Ukrein.
Are they allowed to do that?
Police in riot gear cracking down on citizens. That is what the republican party would like to do with BLM or anybody marching for justice!!
I remember people saying Trump was going to get us into a war..... joe biden the uniter says hold my ice cream.😂😁😆 suckers bought his lies and B.S.
Please  let us just mind my business
Putin has the full support of the United States citizens!
Yes no more war. Xi Jing Ping and Putin should not be leader anymore.
Remember, your dealing with egotistical tyrant who won’t mind hurting his own people.
Man I’m glad to see this because I was certainly praying that the Russian people didn’t back Putin. That would have been frightening. I just hate that all the sanctions and condemnation for their country will impact them most. This is a situation Trump would have gotten the USA in and wouldn’t have cared how Americans felt about it.
We should welcome these people to America with open arms !
Wait until sanctions kick in
American media smh
Russians threw out the Tsars they can stick together and throw out Putin.
The sanctions are going to hurt the Russian people more than Putin. Which is unfair, but it’s the domino effect in which the USA is hoping for. By crippling the Russian economy (the sanctions supposedly will target 80% of all their overall banking assets) and by having a vast majority of the Russia people fall into poverty, they naturally or at least hopefully will rebel against the current regime and then establish a fresh and better regime and this time without Putin of course.
putin is a war criminal!!!
Just want to remind you that CNBC never talked about the brutality Canadian prime minister put peacefull truckers convoy protester last week
Fraud Biden in his creepy, insane whisper voice.  “Hey Vladdy. It’s me Brandon. We are still good with our oil deal and all the money My crack head son Hunter made from jacking Ukraine right?  Hey, I got General “Surrender” Milley and Comrade Psaki here. They would like to say a few words too.  Hello? Vladdy? Vladdy? ...Are you still there? Hello?

LGB
God bless Ukraine and god bless the Russians who don't want war!! Very sad situation and Putin is absolutely repulsive! Keep up the good reporting shep!!!
Yeap same thing Americans did when America invaded Iraq, Vietnam
Russia sucks
I cried😭😭😭😭😭 to see how Russian people against war. They have a good heart as they feel the pain of loosing their love one's because of war. Now a days repentance is the answer of war. I Salute this brave Russian people who are against war. They are pro life🙏😔😭
He has the support of the republican party, FOX NEWS and their deplorable voters!!
It is a tragedy that a man controlling  Russia.
Gulag is filling up
Thank you the people of Russia for supporting the world. President Putin  hear your own people for what they are praying...
Respect to these people risking persecution and possibly death to stand up for the Ukraine
Praiseworthy 🙏🙏
100% respect to Russian citizens!  F Pootin Putin.
Kudos to Russian police 🚔 for stopping this coward Russian civilians. They are the puppet of the Waste(Western)
President Putin is such a cruel man. I hope the war stop because a lot of people will suffer cause of his doing.
Good job putin  👏  👍
Wow Russia is as bad as Canada 🇨🇦
I call bs, the Ukrainian people are pro Russian😆
It's all about drama. Its is politics to fear swift ban.
👍
PROTEST! STAND!  FIGHT BACK AND DEFY THIS CHAOS! WE'RE SMARTER THAN THIS!
Protest in Russia 🇷🇺  are CIA backed people
Biden should send antifa and BLM
They are small groups. A lot of Russians support this invasion because they think Ukraine was the mother of Russian civilization history. Unlike three Baltic countries with different ethnic & historical compositions, Ukraine and Russia are the brother and share the same historical memory.
Respect to the Russian citizens
Putin against God you shall punish God coming for you
It’s time to send Antifa, Black Lives Matter and any other group with a loud voice to help us out in Russia!!! No more war, No more war!!! It’s 2022 dang it No more war!!! God help us all!!! We need everyone to stand up and say no more war and peace for all!!! Please God, No More War!!!
Respect what they are doing. People of all countries want peace and a better life. It’s sad that a few people in power can cause suffering for so many. Time for change.
5 years of peace with President Trump and just within 1 year of biden being the president we have a major war breaking out with a few more in line...eg china vs taiwan.....
Let's protest in front of Russian embassy. I don't see what else I can do as a foreigner
That's because they to have had their fill of Hitler.  The people don't want a war and innocent people killed.  Cheers to the people.  ❤🙏🇺🇸
Never trust an evil dictator?
The whole world will pay the price !
Sending prayers for all  affected by this monstrous act.  This is a sad day in history
Salute to russia protestttttt
So good to see that so many Russian people see the insanity of Putin!
Nobody wants him as president 😕 🙄
Brave protesters
John 7:7 King James Version 7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.  Hebrews 11:6 King James Version 6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.  John 1 King James Version 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  God loves you so much that He sent His only begotten Son to die on the cross to pay for your sins.  If you believe and put your trust in Jesus Christ, that He died on the cross to pay your sin debt and that He rose again on the third day, you will be saved. once you are saved, you will not die in your sins and be damned to hell for eternity.   God will remove your sins and your soul will be washed clean with the blood that Jesus Christ shed for us on the cross. your own good works will not get you into heaven. Jesus Christ did all of the work for you, all you have to do is believe and put your trust in Him and He will save you. Ephesians 1:13 King James Version 13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,. Jesus Christ is coming back very soon and we all have to be ready. I pray in Jesus Christ's mighty name that you be saved.God bless   :)
Putin is going to look back at what he has done in the past and he is going to regret it.
Power to the people!!!
Respect to all the people of Russia for saying no to war...
What would you say about NATO bombing Serbia? Sheer hypocrisy.
" The government is always the ass hole not the people " - a random person on internet
Well done Russian people.
Putin makes me feel better about Biden that's for sure
putin talk about security, nobody want take russia if someone wanted to invade and take control of that country. Usa could do it long ago when soviet collapsed but they didnt.
Not gave ptin the right to invade , remember kosovo in 1999
Power to the good people of Russia!
Russia and Canada acting like war zones because of despotism. Wow. Thanks Rona!!
George Bush claimed he had support but look at the anti war protest! The west should shove it with their hypocrisy!
I knew he wasn't bluffing... let's wait and see how deep in Trump is
No more war please
big question mark whenever I see Western media news
No  use.
My heart goes out to all those Ukrainians who'd been affected by this act, and to all the good Russians who stand in opposition to any instances of further escalation. This is the fault of bigwigs, not the people as a whole.
they grabbed THAT GUY BY THE NECK LIKE AN ANIMAL THATS SO WRONG
We pray for you russian people who want peace.Dont afraid your desire us peace  God bless and help this people
if your country committed to war, is not only about your care about the victim countries, but the government actually use your tax for war. these people's money used by russian govt to do something bad. poor people of military-minded countries like russia and USA
One tiny man.  Wrecking havoc all over.  All wannabe machos in Russia. Can't depose one dude for over 30 years now.
Geez they’re taking the protesters balloons 🎈 too ? Our cops aren’t even that evil
In Russia the president protests again people.
Massiv and bloody invasion?  One like the 40 US invasions since 1945 you mean 🤔
Who the fk does Vitamin Pudding think he is!! We want peace not war!!
Sadly alot of these people voted for Putin now they're paying the price.
America arrested Jan 6th protesters, Canada arrested freedom convoy protesters, Russia arrests war protesters… these authoritarian dictators are all the same
Off to gulag with you
How about pro peace
Coup d'etat in Russia is imminent as people of Russia don't support the invasion of Ukraine
So protesters in Russia are right and protesters in Canada wrong??????
These so called leaders want war, put them in a cage and let them fight each other man to man! NO MORE USELESS WARS!!!
Speak out Russian.
It would help a lot if Biden stopped buying oil from Russia.  Hypocrisy at it's best.
Sheeple. Have the audacity to out hand on humans asking for peace. It's the same demons that hung Jesus. Killed MLK. Violence on this planets sickens me. The Crap Putin gets away with.  How do we get the sickness out of the human head ?
It will take one hero to stop Putin...hope there is a Russian general who will do it? Russians will suffer and go hungry with economic and financial sanctions for many years?
I want to find information on the situation in the sarcophagus of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.  There is information on the Internet that the Russians have captured it and can blow it up if Ukraine tries to knock them out of there.
We stand with the people of Russia to protest the war.
Oust Putin now or all the Russians will suffer the consequences of his actions the Russia will Fall,many Russians will die...
How many world started. provoke. lead n generate  by US ? but none of it in US soil, i hate world but i do wish there can TASTE it ...... world is better without USA.
war is not the answer! I pray for all people!
U.s. has the best media influence it must create chaos and anarchy in russia by paying its citizens
Russian people now have more access to world news . They are not being lied to and brainwashed like in the communist era of the soviet union . Russian people know the world news and events just like  people from Europe and the US . It's now harder to lie to them since the internet form a web around the world . Communist can't control people mind anymore ...except in North Korea where people are brainwashed so much they think and act like robots or zombies . Russian people are lucky that they dont live under communism like in N Korea or in vietcong ( viet communist ) country .
GOOD FOR THEM KEEP IT UP; THE PEOPLE can revolt-Perhaps the police are away fighting in the Ukraine...and the PEOPLE can take control GOOD FOR THEM! 1000 ARRESTED, HOPE THAT'S OUT OF TEN THOUSAND REBELLING !  GOOD FOR THEM!!!
The only thing that can stop Russia is Russia herself. In what way? I have no idea.
Exactly what needs to be done including cops need to turn awsy
Protests won't bring back dead kids
Are you sure that’s not Ottawa?
Its honestly crazy how some people think they can just hurt hundreds and take over places all because they want a peice of land. I feel horrible for all those people who are hurt and who are died/dying from Russia right now.
That's communists Russia for you......🤔.  One man making decisions not the people.
Fake news
this is Putin War, not Russia War
Did any protest stopped USA to invade Iraq 🤭
May this war end . GOD bless Amen
Well done Russians keep up the protests
Stop war NOW!!!!!!
It looks like the video shot maybe in Canada
Just give up peacefully. You can always change things later.
So what's new, Americans have been  doing the same for years to their ppl who marched against invasion of Iraq and other states and still doing so now.
No we don’t want war
if you support russia, i see your point of view*      *if i was as drunk as a normal russian was
Looks just like over here. Sad world
Events unfolding for a reason.. time for ppl power to remove unwanted leadership!! Putin's time is up!! Only time will tell!!
All the peace loving people across the globe love and respect Mr. V. Putin.  Western propaganda is dying.  When western warmongers attacked Iraq,  millions of people protest against their war crimes but nothing happened. The western warmongers continued their destructive policies.  USA and UK brought Ukraine at this point. Now Ukrainian should learned.  God bless Russia.
Trump says Putin is better than Biden Fox supports trump
Good job Russian people!
May the Great Spirits Peace and Love comfort and protect all Righteous People
He is protecting the oligarchs secure position by not allowing all the surrounding countries show how a government should run. I hope there are severe western travel restrictions put on these oligarchs, the smart ones may realize Putin just sent them down the USSR tunnel with a difference the USSR top people were Communist so did not have piles of assets they looted from the people. This is closer to a Sadame USSR with rich corrupt leaders, it usually doesn't end well when the military finally turns on the leadership and they know it.
Hallelujah! More support for PEACE!
See the thing we have to remember is that in countries like Russia and China, the government is the one who controls the media. China more so than Russia because at the least Russian citizens can get access to outside of the country news. They aren’t 100% spoonfed so they are able to congregate their own opinions. That said, we realize that in China and Russia, it’s not necessary about country pride rather it’s about the party in charge. It’s not about China, it’s about the CCP. With Russia, it’s not about the country either. It’s about Putin and his party. He WAS ex KGB. Regardless though, the party in Russia can’t 100% control the population like China can therefore protests like this are more likely to happen. We hope that it all comes back to blow up in Purim’s face.
Republicans support Putin even fox news
Considering none of the countries plan on getting involved they might be right…. Russia and Ukraine might be the only ones who will suffer, it’s clear that no one else wants to be involved with war and drive the situation further into madness. As cheap as it’ll sound….guess all we can do is pray and hope everything will be good for both countries.
That's the way to go Russians people. We, US citizen, did the same when our government invaded Iraq and Afghanistan.  oh. Did we?
Good job Russians so brave and proud, only you guys can stop this non-sense acts, God bless you, Ukrainians and the entire world, bless from Mexico 🇲🇽
Now this propaganda is about to start the war machine is rolling
Those mortars are fired by u.s spies in Russian uniforms, gears, and equipment sent by Biden to start a war for Oil. It's all about Oil and natural resources. The russian troops was never even close to the location of the incident.
Putin is a murder
PUTIN DOESN'T CARE ABOUT HIS OWN PEOPLE
Love you guys upto Moon and back. Peace keeperssssssss
Sadly, shame on Russia 🇷🇺
I AM INDIAN AMERICAN, I HAVE KNOWN AND LOVED ALL UKRAINIANS AND RUSSIANS, THEY ARE REALLY GOOD PEOPLE.. I AM DISGUSTED WITH DEPLORABLE ACTS OF Putin.. I can not believe an intelligent country like Russia, Putin is disgracing it so badly in 2022.  Also why wasn't 200,000 western, EU, Ukraine army not stationed as deterrent. By EU, USA, West, UN not doing anything in 2014, they have enabled this.. SAD SAD SAD, such intelligent country like Russia should know better in today's day and age.. Terribly sad sad development..
I give my snappy salutes for the Russians who defy their leader from shedding blood. 🇵🇭
Putin said arrest anyone who wants to protest his war.
Wow lets protest and walk the streets. Like that does something
I pray for the people of Ukraine and Russia. They don't deserve to deal with this nonsense. There's already enough going on in the world as it is. I pray this all ends soon.
I knew the people wouldn't stand for this . Long live the good people of Russia 🇷🇺 🙏
People power!
The Russian people have always been strong and had great moral compasses. Russian "government" .... not so much.
Putin coward brutal dictator
Putin lived his life now he is celebrating hell.
NO MORE WAR!!!!!!!!
Two thumbs up for the Russian citizens and God be with Ukraine people
While Russian and Ukrainian busy killing each other. Chinese president is smiling. This is exactly what he want to see. Soon he will own everyone single one of you.
RISE UP AGAINST THE FASCIST
bad  sad     but   if nato     had    not    offer   to    missals     there   would   there  be   a  war  ?   why  cant  this  be   talked  about
Those protestors are good people that don't know how to world works.  Putin is a good person who knows how the world works.
From the United States to Russia good job Russia I wish we had someone like Putin in the white house maybe we get some s*** done around here
There will a small bunch of people that always oppose everything so its not a big of a deal
Wake up Russian people your corrupt putin gang War on  your brother  stop him killing innocent people
LIISTEN CNBC  THAT PEOPLE ARE  U   K R A I N  I AN
Lol, Putin has been trying to interfere with our politics and divide us farther apart; little did he know his own people were divided too.
Love will unite this world.
Bwahaha! "My people agree with me..."🤬 (NOT)! If they're unhappy with fearless leader now, wait til those sanctions start crushing their commerce.😈 Let's see how Vladimir fares when his citizens grow tired of paying for his avaricious goals. 🧐😏😈
First thought in my head when the video starts: “eyebrows.”
Don't need leader who's destroying peace in world. Pls God punish soon as possible.
Would be nice for a new russian revolution to ovwr throw putin.
@1:23 Russians out here arresting balloons 🎈 😳 ... ain't nobody safe.
This is so good to see. This could lead to the end of Putin.
No one wants war!! Are you kidding me?! No one wants to die from these gov war mongering idiots
They forgot about INFLATION REAL QUICK LOLOLOL. It doesn't even matter anymore, it was the only thing on CNBC for about 4 months...
russian and ukranian will lost ........
Russia has no human rights this country is hell
What is their beef?  Do they have forced inoculation?  No.  Children learning CRT?   No.   Are they starving?  No.   Do they have a weak, ineffective, satanic leader?  No.
I love putin, Ukraine sucks. Their people need to be taken over! Glory to putin.   (Testing the YouTube comment bot to see if this gets deleted.
CANADA?????   Nobody STOMPED TO DEATH BY A HORSE YET????   Jeepers Russia SO DISAPPOINTING!!!!
ALLELUIA! PEACE TO RUSSIAN PEOPLE. Hoping your President will STOP this Blood Shed!
All these Russian  brothers  have balls of steel to protest against  wicked and evil putin ( master of Trump)
Soooo . . . Putin has neither the support of courageous, outspoken Russians, he also doesn't have the support of the 'olygarchs'. He's alone. So courageous if Russians to demonstrate knowing what they know. Hail Navalny!!!
Russian people are smarter than their leaders ❤
All those arrested are dead now for turning on there president
Putin is a thug who has brought shame on Russia. I hope the people have the courage to stand up and reject this warmongering SOB. God bless Ukraine.
I heard Biden's Address was him telling Gorbachev to tear down the wall....
I think all people in the world must stand up this time,to protest any form of war.Let all the leaders fight each other,but spare mother earth and all living things.
Peace for all, die Leuten in Russland können ein 3- ten Weltkrieg verhindern in dem sie überall demonstrieren, wir brauchen kein Krieg in Europa 😨😨😨
These protesters are so brave. In the U.S. protest is legal but people still are to afraid to fight for what's right, or find it inconvenient to do so. These Russians, under the threat of death, still fight for Ukrainians right to freedom. I pray for their safety and that that make it back home to their families quickly and unharmed.
Straight to the gulag 💀
Is that Russia or Canada? I can’t tell..
I support those who protest at their own risk for their rights or for peace! Saluting these most brave Russians and also the Canadian truckers who are risking their lives and livelihood respectively for better lives, better conditions and defence of rights! Not everyone can frontline like this tbh. Regardless to whatever side you're on, you gotta respect that.
Please protect the children of Ukraine!!
you can’t blame the Russian people, they only know what Putin wants them to know.
Brave !!! Russian people should join protest against war. no more war!
Bravoooooo...THISSS IS RUSSIA! not that s.o.b. tyrant. Praying for peace for Ukraine and Russia. 👏👏👏👏💛💛💛💛 KEEP THE PROTESTS ALIVE IN RUSSIA AND AROUND THE WORLD.
It´s really important to remember that russia didn´t start the war. Vladimir Putin did but not the russians. They protest under the threat of being arrestet against this discusting war.  Don´t forget that we´re not fighting russia but Vladimir putin. Respect to all the people that are protesting!
There were huge hong kong protests too but the ccp ended up with it anyway & now no one talks about it.  There were protests of not bailing out of afghanistan & america still bailed & left 1000's for dead & $millions in weapons to cult thugs. America did nothing when russia took crimea... The west will do nothing now with ukraine, it's the trend.
They know the Russian economy is about to go bye bye
His own people protest says a lot about him
Im sure the russian people know that this can turn out horrible for them and for everyone if the US and other step in. In truly wondering how all this will turn out.
Putin needs to be removed
Oh no.... Pray for these people, as well.
Typical of these world leaders how they say they have the support of their people just like Justin Trudeau prison is a good place for those guys
See how these people are treating for protesting. That's how we need to treat BLM & Antifa... Shut their asses up...
Welcome to the Russian Spring!
러시아 유튜브 차단해라
Do you hear the people sing
You would think they would have pulled those balloons away but nope arrested her balloons n all
The Russian protestors are kind human beings who don't want to see people dying.
Thank you citizens of Russian
They have been Anti-Putin for a while now, they desperately want new leadership for Russia.
It just looks like Ottawa a few days ago .
President Biden, you keep stating you will protect NATO countries. It’s obvious to me you have selective memory loss. Where is the guarantee that USA, UK, and France gave Ukraine for handing over all its nuclear arsenal to Russia “for safe keeping” ? The USA signed the Budapest Memorandum in 1994! That is a legally binding document! Even if all of NATO does not agree to fight Putin, the USA, UK AND France do have a legal responsibility and obligation to do so
MY GOD!!! At the end of the day we all bleed 🩸 red blood. This is war against humanity. May God strengthen and protect the innocent.
Arrest them all Putin give them life
half life 2 in real life
No more war ❤️❤️❤️
Dys Nat Police.dys.KGB.NKWD.Morders.Egen Own.Citizen.Protekt Bolszewick Cumunist . Ideologies.
Praying for a break within the military and police force to support the demonstrators.
If India invade pakistan or china, no Indians will protest. So India should just go and invade pakistan and china and bangladesh
Hrssht.  There are protestors in every war.  To claim that protestors represent the will of the Russian people at large is absurd.  By your logic, the rioters at the U.S. capital on January 6th proves that Biden regime is not legitimately elected.  You wanna go down that road?
imagine americans get arrested for protesting damn how nice we have it thank god
YES!! LETS GO!! PEACE!
A special place in hell is reserved for Putin. The russian people know it.
You know this is messed up when even the Russian citizens are condemning Putin
CNBC media is also part of the communist regime .
So proud of the protestors!  It is a shameful atrocity what Putin is doing to the people of Ukraine.  We all want peace, Putin needs to be overthrown by Russians from within to stop the bloodshed.  Get out protest for peace, they can't arrest the whole country!
My heart melts when I see my russian brothers standing up on our behalf.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  https://youtu.be/einTXaSeGAI
I know everyone wants peace and I wish I lived in a world where people only know peace. But does anybody not understand what is going on? Putin felt like he had to invade Ukraine to secure Russia’s future and security. If he didn’t, then the west would of taken over and put Russia at risk of even having a future.
It's not Russia vs Ukraine  It's Putin vs Ukraine
They can't arrest everyone in Russia if you all stand together, we stand with you against the war.  Everyone, everywhere should be voicing their support, across all platforms.
Russia is run by a communist and Biden is going along with it!
ur eyelashes are horrendous
Ha, Ha, Ha, . . . .Evil MasterMind, WAR CRIMINAL  Ex-KGB Assassin Putin had  to explain to his handlers why the "Ruble is in the TOILET" . . . He better starting watc over his shoulder . . . Not good to MESS with Gangsters MONEY . . .
Lol this is a long time  video
The world will be so much better when soldiers and police are not stupid to obey stupid orders but fulfill their duty of protecting the people.
A big hope for the rest of the world is the Russian people. Let the world stand up for peace ✌️
President Putin is unafraid of NATO, United States or United Nations, smoke that in your pipe...
Meanwhile Andh bhakts indian supporting where there PM is, brainwashed by politics.
So... Putin says Russians stand with him...seems like the only ones standing with him are the ones he's using as pawns to Bully Ukraine...and his own people...  That's far right politics for ya
I am Canadian we all love you but our governments are the ones that always want war not us civilians and all governments are corrupt.
Russian people who aren't brainwashed by your Russian Hitler Putler and his junta propaganda, watch the truth about your dictator and his cronies on YouTube channels : Navalny Live Vladimir Milov
Russians and Ukrainians are our friends . To the people in Russia please keep doing your part in your streets do whatever it takes to stop your government from this war. My Ukrainian brothers and sister please stay strong we are all witnessing this and wish we can do more 🙏🏻😔 in the end i believe in god and I know god will keep those who are by his side safe ✨we are all humans and peace is what we need please be safe on both sides 🇺🇦 🇷🇺 sending love from San Francisco 🇲🇽🇺🇸
Russians need to awaken to the fact that they are letting themselves be led by a war criminal and self aggrandizing delusional Megalomaniac!
THANK YOUR RUSSIANS. KEEP DOING IT TO STOP YOUR CRAZY LEADER !!!!!
I am shook. Faith in humanity restored.
Keeping pressure on the oligarchs will be effective.
Wait until the Russian son's bodies come back.  Watch the protests then.
Hopefully they won't do what Canada did to the truckers
We are with the Russian people! Sincerely, all Americans who didn't support TRUMPSKI
Wow, the protest are huge!! Bless the Russian people who are taking to the streets. Prayers for them and their Ukrainian brothers and sisters.
Peoples of Russia they not want  war too..
Respect to the people who were protesting against Putin's actions.
putin and law enforcement everywhere are the devils of this world.
Our efforts only work if the Russians themselves take a stand against the needless genocide of the Ukrainians!
Russian Citizen must act now to avoid economic catastrophes that they may suffer as time comes
This is what happens when too much power is consolidated around a small group of people. Too much power and wealth is corrupting to core the of the human spirit. Like Johnny Cash sang and which authoritarians should heed, "You can run on for long time, run on for a long time, you can run on for a long time, but sooner or later god will cut you down." And so too will the people because they will demand his long overdue retirement.
"CRY HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR!!!!".....(William Shakespeare, year 1601)
Every county has Rebel's
Putin is an old timer and is up against younger generations that will be less tolerant of a dictator than their parents and grandparents!  Social media is their best weapon against being kept in the dark.  Let’s hope protests will continue.
War is futile but the difference I see between Western Nations and Russia is that when allied forces kills and innocent they become heroes, if they invade any country they become heroes. But when Russia did the same they are villain. I think all should be equally treated as villains. Whether it's NATO, USA, Russia or China if they wage war against anyone.
Pray for peace ☮️!
stand up to wrong doings of your government my beautiful Russian citizens..we Americans are with you ❤
Very brave people.  Standing up to the worst fascist dictator since Hitler..
Russians are mostly good people ... you Mr Putin are a discrace to Russia.
PUTIN IS GOING TO RUIN THE FUTURE OF YOUNGER GENERATIONS OF RUSSIA
We needs protests like these to happen around the world, particularly at every Russian Embassy and Consolate.
Only evil people will support Putin. He is wicked and evil. God will definitely punish him and his accessories.  Prayers for Ukraine and those Russian peace loving people.
How about we just nuke them first
Shepard Smith is a liberal stooge. His embracing of radical liberalism is an example of the American view that allowed this to happen.
All narcissistic psychopaths are falsely confident.
It was War in the name of Putin...
All of you people of russia must unite to stop your president putin. All of you will suffer also soon
Give em hell, Ukraine.
Man protesting there is a one way ticket to Siberia... huge set on these people..
Someone wake up Biden.
Stop the killing mr putingo
God bless  the Russian people!  They have compassion  for  Ukraine
Shame on Russia , they are gonna slip up and do something stupid and have nato and the US mess them up. I don't want it to happen but we would easily beat them . We would lose a good bit of troops but they would lose more. And now that the world knows weak biden will do nothing , China will attack Taiwan.  Funny how no news outlet is mentioning biden. If Trump was president, they would blame it on him . Typical leftist media, protecting their leftist president.  Trump would be out there reassuring us , sleepy joe is hiding and doing nothing.
Now that Putin has been hailed as a genius by Trump, the buffoon who acted more as court jester than as the 45th president of the US, Putin better apply his genius to figuring out how he will house the growing number of Russians who are being arrested for protesting the invasion.
Not everyone is patriotic. 100% cannot be achieved even in a undemocratic country.
The police officers in Russia and military make me sick doing this to their own people.
This is the power of media, the news they want to show. Is this all the Russian people? Are those rioters not violent? C’mon there is the social media. You cant brainwash people with this bias news.
A clear Dictator.
Shut off all Military Fuel, Food, Ammunition pipelines, distribution and transportation vehicles and aircraft. Threaten safety of what Putin loves or what the people close to him love and care about. Get the support of everyone who doesn’t like Putin. Isolate all of the military vehicles and personnel sent to Ukraine from any support in Russia. Disable all of their military fuel tankers on ground, water and in air. Dry up anything they might get in Ukraine. War cannot be maintained without those things.
Stay strong guys. We love you!!
This is very much rotten to the core with CIA Americans NATO West doing just exactly like was done in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan. This is exactly the very same text book played here to try and bring Russia down from inside and Putin will crash this American NATO West snakes head and he must hunt down every single CIA agents in Russia
Funny talking smack about arresting protestors while Canada does the same. Shame.
Praying 🙏
Capture all the leaders for re education
Could this be just a trap that Putin fell into both feet ?
I feel putin hiding his pain for long time ...and now he can't tolerate anymore
Russia is protecting the people of Donbass.
🇷🇺👎👎👎🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺👎👎👎
Lol so is Biden and the woke crowd gonna ask Twitter to block Putin’s account? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 weak ass leadership.  80+ million votes, how are those votes working out?
Just like 🇨🇦 but you guys did absolutely nothing freedom to the people of Ukraine.
Pray for everyone 🙏
I love how CNBC TV is showing what thugs the Russian Police are for brutalizing and arresting peaceful protesters, but you were too cowardly to show or report on the truth of Canadian Police brutalizing and arresting peaceful protestors and independent JOURNALISTS! You are hypocritical cowards! You only report what suits your agenda. You disgust us!
I love that they're so threatened that they arrested a bunch of balloons.
Ha you'll just be like Trudeau Fringe minority
Putin obviously didn't think this over These will make him more and more unpopular
For people who want a very interesting view of why and who's fault this war is.   https://youtu.be/JrMiSQAGOS4
Putin is not a president. He's a thug.
I bet if Putin was black, he would be ousted or dead by now.
Public support to Putin is his financial wealthy cronies.
For Russian people who don’t want war thank you for protesting! Ukraine stay strong try to find shelter God Bless!
Solo se echo la soga Al cuello.
The fake news want us to go to war 😤 😒 😪 😔
These arrested Russian might end up in Siberia. Balls of steel.
The chance of Ukraine to win this war against Russia  is the Russian people itself.
I want to eat Piroshki
Navalny has much more meaningful ideas about how to help Russians in the Ukraine.
Who are you to judge Russia.
Putting is a great man who knows what he's doing.  He is a real world leader.
PUTIN is a great leader, all he do is for russia's security, Ukraine membership to Nato is dangerous for your countries security in the future, Ukraine President just dont understand it's the geographical location in the map. the position of this country should be neutral not to join NATO or RUSSIA.
If anyone in Russia is listening, don’t stop let your voices get heard use the internet as your weapon.
Respect for these people. These are scary times
Good, thank The Good Lord.
Puttin the official chinese goverment popet
What! Proeganda in Russia too! Just like here, the government says thing that they want you to think.
Sent to gulag.
“History teaches us, however, that when the times are ripe for change and the government refuses or is unable to change, either society starts to decay or a revolution begins.” - M. Gorbachev
This backwards minded soviet era relic authoritarian has feared losing control of his power which is why he has suppressed opposition for years. He is using the tools of war and violence once again to suppress human rights of freedom and self determination. He has been a major roadblock in the natural progression of democracy and openness to the west in Russia. If he and his cronies were relegated to the disappointing heap of history where they have belonged for decades, we wouldn't have as much conflict in the world and NATO would not be so heavily focused on Russia as a threat to Europe or the West. Regime change in Russia is long overdue and soon enough, his own people will grow tired of his archaic repressive and outdated tactics. That is what he is truly afraid of, and it probably keeps him up at night.
Civilian of the world doesnot  want the war.
Russians—it will take millions of you in the streets to convince any us that you’re not guilty of the largest groupthink of any country outside of China.
Police will kiss them!   US police officer kisses the anti War protestors!
This is how the fall of putin come to the world
Get Trudeau in  there. He took away the protestor truckers livelyhood. and locked them up.
You mean like the Truckers protest in Canada last week? It looks like the same thing to me!
Russia 🇷🇺 💪💪🚀💣💥💥🏳️‍🌈America 🇺🇸 NATO and West 💥👹💥👹💥👋👋🥳🥳🥳
Vladimir Putin should never feel safe walking the streets of Russia again...
So, after Russia takes Ukraine "for security purposes" . . . (meaning the Ukraine is a democracy, and a border state), what will stop them from taking the next border state for "security purposes"? The threat is Putin. Not Ukraine, or Poland, or whomever is next. Putin.
Браво 👏  Путин  you fitting too protect your  Russian people so why he attacks Russian people who just protesting for pics they really just saying we want live in pics they get arrested for telling you true about you
Why are we buying Russian oil if Biden put sanctions on Russia? ????? Hmm?
It's crazy how love can overcome fear🙏
This is very much rotten to the core with Americans CIA AND THE WEST globalist criminals doing right now to try and bring Russia down from inside, this is just exactly what they did with Libya and Syria and Iraq they started it with puppet paid protesters and the very same thing happened right now in Canada the globalist criminals deep state governments. These globalist murdering criminals want to have totalitarian control dictatorship over the world order and yes China needs to wake up for China will be next on their hit list.
JOE  Biden  administration  could have prevented  this,   wonder  why. No prevented?
They know this will be the beginning of the end
Good for those Russian people. Putin will find his place in the Lake of Fire.
There hungry kids, homless people, fix USA, our country first, OLD MAN.JOE BIDEN! Do something to help the kids and you chamge a whole  Generation of people, you treat those  Minority kids in the city bad, dont be suprised when they the end up being criminals and Robing you're dumb A$$ when a after school program, or sports, or a reck  Center could have been built and been a positive influence, instead of a kid hangin out with the wrong crowd cus he ant got no were to go. In 2022 there ant no reason any young kid should be hungry or not have enough food. This.is more important than any war!
I thinks Trudeau show Putin do the same    he did in OTAWA
The Russian government will never understand our suffering.
I beg the russians to convince putin to stop the war 😭😭😭 breaks my heart. Dear people of russia , if u are reading this plz listen u have been brainwashed my your media that ukraine wants war , no that is not the case , they want peace , plz stop your president. Continue to protest, remember u are saving millions of lives .  —From india
@1:24 Good job Russian police They've managed to arrest a handful of ballons. Where's Trudeau when you need one to condemn a fringe minority?
Sahi hein war koi solution nehi hein..... Freedom of life is precious then war and communalism
GET UP! STAND UP!! STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS!!!! GET UP! STAND UP!! DONT GIVE UP THE FIGHT!!!!!!
That's what our future will be if we don't stand for our FREEDOM. Communism isn't good at all. Those where very brave Russian.
#LongLiveRUSSIA🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺 Russian #invasion of Ukraine is #necessary & #justified!  Russia has been negotiating for months. It cannot wait forever for answer / result if the NATO is playing the #BideTimeGame while arming Ukraine.  #Russia 🇷🇺is no fool to allow #NATO to buy time under the pretense of prolonging the negotiations while the #UnitedStates #UK NATO are pouring weapons into #Ukraine.  Russia is aware that the #NATO is using Ukraine to push Russia on the wall.  So Russia negotiated for too long with the NATO / UKRAINE, issued its #SecurityDemands but was ignored & the response it recieved was NATO prolonging the nego while flooding Ukraine with weapons & hitting Russia with sanctions --- RUSSIA is no fool to play the role the NATO think Russia would do.  NATO CANNOT IN ANYWAY PLAY ITS GAME WITH RUSSIA -- RUSSIA knows their game!   As for the #Donetsk #Luhansk issue, these two new states for 8 years had experienced brutal oppression from #UkrainianRegime in Kyiv, now they have spoken, their call for #FREEDOM, the will & right for freedom bu the entire population of these two states is important than what NATO want --- It MUST BE #RESPECTED by the world especially the NATO nations who dont own a piece of sh*t in those areas.-------
Prayer for people of Russia for standing against the war,.                                                           Prayer for Ukraine 💕💞💖❤️
Russian “business community” is going to take Putin down if they incur excessive loses down the road.
💙Will you change it, No More War...🖖
Prayers for the people of Russia 🇷🇺 and Ukraine 🇺🇦
I pray for a coup in Russia, this is Putin’s downfall
The west will not spare and remove sanctions that easily , your economy will die ..unless Ukraine territory will be given to the rightful owner whom are now migrants of Poland..look at those persons crying with uncertainties where to relocate themselves..
Putin id the real terorism of humanity
So proud of the Russian people.  Unlike the Americans, it's apparently a peaceful protest - no looting, no arson, no shooting.
CNBC=USA & NATO MEDIA
Looks prety much like Canada
Russia does not care about the protesters and they will get no due process.  It’s scary.
And a cue will happen. Ww3 will be…
I ask other countries should not interfere in situation of Russian President , He is going to make an immortal peace in this world step by step. Every leaders should wait and see, They should followed his plan
Every government building in Moscow needs to be leveled.  He wants war? Straight to Hell he goes!
The cops are just order followers. POS straight up
This is fake news very characteristic of the bloody American media.
Won’t matter unfortunately
if Russia will be taken off from the swift financial system..i dont know how would they stir their economy anymore..
Western propaganda machine is on🤣🤣🤣
Fake News
FOR THE MOTHERLAND!
Not even the Russian citizens want war....just power mad Putin.
So unlike western claims, democracy is there in Russia. Good
Режим на украине последние 5 лет поддерживает русофобию и блокирует свободу слова. Эта вонючая политика запада на всех пост советских республиках сейчас.  Это политика NATO.
Good
Putin's countdown has begun
This reminds me of how Americans stood against our president during the Vietnam war. War is evil. It literally goes against the peace we all wish to have. Praying for Ukrain.🙏🏽
Wow he Lied what a surprise
One of the best things happen this year
Thank you for protesting!  We only have 1 life to live, why spend it on fighting a war!  Praying for Ukraine and Russians that don’t want this. May god bless us all and touch the hearts of those that are doing evil. 🙏🏽
❤🙏🙏🙏❤😢😢😢
We all need to offer if we are able
Nobody should listen to that old man Putin he's a traumatized crazy man
Putin has lost his mind ..   respect to all Russian people who are against  this war
Looks like the canada protest
God bless the people they the only ones that can stop him USA stands with u the people take your country back
Putin has to Netflix and chill.
Gj for Russian police! This ukraniars and liberals are betradars.
Russians being woke?
Mr Putin...we have some democrates and liberals here in America we would like to send to Siberia with your protestors.
What frustrates me is the Russian government isn't going to stop this war.
If u are Russian I will pay your bail
Whatever happening is just because of that God awful Joe Biden a trash of a president ever in human history
These people don't know that putin care for them. If putin will not move they are the ones who will suffer.  NATO Secretary General: NATO is the strongest alliance in history, and make no mistake; we will defend and protect every ally against any attack and every inch of NATO territory.  Make Sense?
Thank you ☸ May there be hope.
Russia is Russia not putin.
nato is the source of this conflict, then the media took the advantage
We never war.beacause after the second World war, all world presidents understood nobody win, nobody fail,, all the world are destroyed
Since when America cares about innocent people! The fake Symphaty!
Yippee
Prayers of safety to those brave protesters! I don't know what God or Gods they believe in, but I'll pray to any higher power out there that the people of Ukraine and the protesters taking a stance will be protected and as safe as possible. May all who read this take care at times like this, hug your loved ones a little closer and pray that this can resolve peacefully. To those that were innocent and brave, their lives taken for the sake of power, Rest In Peace and prayers to their grieving families.
but why you guy dont realise its all about chernobyl waste of nuclear to make cash whith new diamonds batterie xS thats make me sick and no one just realise thats
Putin would back down if BLM protested over there...Yep!
All the federation should go against Russia and Belarus
Bet Libs had Zero Idea that Ukraine was not apart of Nato or SWIFT 😆 HEY Hunter are you going to help Ukrainians? 🤔 I don't hear the libtard gun grabbers yelling take the guns in Ukraine anymore
The same schill lot will do that.theyvare cowards by nature.
So hope is alive
Unbelievable..May God have mercy.
Stay strong Ukraine! Countries have the right to independence, freedom and sovereignty. Stop the war!
Good arrests them all this people want to be inslave by the west
Please people of Russia, let your voices be heard. What your leaders are doing is just straight up warmongering.
Fake news is at it again.  TELL the truth about  Ukraine double standards. USA is failure State on Peace.They created the war.
PEACE, LOVE  NOT  WAR✌🏼 Praying for Ukraine🙏🏻
Yes!
Welp gods coming for sure soon it even said in the Bible and there’s a war that started and that’s not stopping soon the next hit that thy are throwing we will die so everyone get ready because god is on his way.
The Russia of 1980s is back …
Respect russian people. but I think putin will alone one day.
Protests everywhere around the world for variety of reasons, I swear since start of covid people just want to protest to be out among groups again !
Breaking news: Ukraine will NOT be joining NATO.
KGB.NKWD.Brutal.Atak .Own.Citizen.
US funded NGOs in action.
Let the russian people hamdle there own country,  that ant our busness!
Arresting peaceful protesters just happened in Ottawa Canada last week by the dictator of Canada too.  You guys didn't report on that.
Are true dictator and to believe that some republicans and our ex president praised this dictator
I don't believe third party news. More than 50% is misinfo
Its time for Putin to LEAVE OFFICE.....Or should I say TAKEN OUT !!!!  For someone who keeps changing the Russian constitution to keep voting himself in power should have been a red flag for Russians everywhere a LONG TIME AGO. Stand up for FREEDOM Russia.
To the protesters...Thank you for standing up to your leader. Knowing right from wrong has no allegiance. Neither does living right. We love you here in 🇺🇸
Prayers go out to Ukraine and Russia people
Put these protesters in jails, they are traitors and puppets of other countries
The Kremlin looks so bad right now. Afraid of its own people
more people in russia are defending peace, freedom and democracy than in the u.s republican party. figure that one out.
WILL THE DESPOT PUTIN GET THE MESSAGE?...RUSSIAN PEOPLE STAND UP TO THE FASCIST DICTATOR...LEAVE THE UKRAINIANS ALONE AND FREE
No more war...... Putin listen to your people
Russia invading ukrine to protect u people
lol to be honest, most Russian's wants it, even half of the Ukrainian.
All world with Putin
Putin leave Ukrainean alone! So so proud of all the Russian people who against the war. Salute!
why are they taking the balloons into the police car? LMAO
It's interesting how we the biggest lovers of war within the last 30 years are all of sudden supporters of anti war movement we are not stupid you media were instruments of war when we was protesting against it in iraq
St Petersburg looks like Ottawa.
Putin’s show his real color An evil dictator dressing up as an ortho Christian downfall for Putin no one is with u murderer👿👿👿
Just like Canada.
Putin using the risk of Ukraine joining NATO- what a BS excuse for war!
OMG
If there is major sanction,the Russian common people suffer the most.....
Putin is a madmen spinning in his own delusions. A bullet has his name on it if he appears anywhere in public...
THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF LIBERAL AMERICA JUST FUKED UKRAINE.... OH WAIT THAT'S EVERY COUNTRY HMM 😒 🤔
The whole world needs to protest this war of aggression!!!
Same like USA when invade Iraq, Libya, Afganistan
Putin you coward, you murderer.
Time to stand up against Nonsense and depose Putin and Oligarchs
Putin never read about the history of China, Korea, and Japan.
well of course he was confident.. he is a narcissistic dictator, with all the apparent control he has in russia he would think people would be brainwashed enough to follow along
unseat your president if you dont want to feel the pressure that other nations will impose on russia
Jajajaja Putin is an assasin he has to arrest his own people that hate him
Putin must die. I mean...its you, the russians that have this responsibility. You must protest and ensure that this dictator will die....You have to save the world!
THE WORLD WANT A RUSIA FULL OF LOVE FOR OTHERS NOT FULL OF NUCLEAR ARMS AND AMBITION TO INVADE WEAK COUNTRIES,PLEASE STOP WAR ,PLEASE STOP PUTIN ...
Russia people are beautiful people right, not Putin jerk
We love you 😓 God be with you all
I am very proud of Russian People who want peace and protesting against the war. I salute all Russian People who want peace.
theres no upside invading ukraine here for putin.. let just face china is the real enemy here
How is an entire country so afraid of one man?
Im so fricking scared you brave souls, God bless you
Putin and his govt can declared war in fiery speeches in defending their Interests, but it will be Russian body bags that will arrive back home; and the prices of goods and electronics at the stores will feel by everyday Russian people more than the politicians, who'll party and celebrate their victories in their lavish government mansions across the country.
putins got to go
God Bless the Russians who are protesting the war against Ukraine keep fighting for peace.
I am glad people are trying to stop it but it’s not easy but I hope this war end soon I pray for the people safety
Awesome, BE careful protestors.they have no compassion for your LIFE . JUST CONTROL POWER TRIPS of childish dark dictators.💚💛💜💜🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷
looks like Canada:))))))
Lol
Power to the people of Russia. 🇷🇺 🇨🇦
America can’t even take care of our own borders. We can’t do anything about someone’s borders all the way around the world.
So russians in dombas should die becouse this guys and girls want it?
Only those who had experience war has learn the worst lesson from it
Staged by U.S. propaganda machine.
✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼 From a american from N.Y.C.
Battleship Potemkin
Good for them, they are in no small way Putins hostages.
I would be protesting too. The Russian people are ready to be at peace.
US too arrogant to discuss with putin let other world leader do
UKRAINIANS obviously has nerves of steel. All of their volunteers, defending their country. Stay strong Ukraine! And for those taking up arms to protect their country, I respect you ✊
Power to the people! I don't believe in governments but I believe in human race. United , we shall prevail. If not , we will repeat history like we have always did.
STOP WAR ✌️
When will the US regime be sanctioned for all the hell it has rained cross this world?!
Russian civilians can help save the lives of millions if they keep protesting
Putin is off his rocker. Dudes lost it. Invades a country that all likely hood wouldn’t join NATO. Crazy world we live in.
Even their own countrymen  are shouting stop this nonsense and this massacre.
Anti war protest ? kmt they are traitors obviously they are not looking at the broader picture
this is tyranny not usa
Putin is 70 years old. The only conclusion i can come to is the man wants to go out with a bang to try to make the late part of his life more interesting. Disgusting.
The political  opposicion of Putin ,please telling the truth...
No War
This is why the second amendment is so important!
I guess they have somewhere warm too sleep
Ukraine's military forces are called Azov Battalion, just google what they stand for. I think the majority of the people would quickly change their support for Putin...
I'm guessing Putin isn't going to get the votes he needs
*A Russian Platoon did surrender in Ukraine as they didn't know they were being taken there to fight and refused.*
Canada should take some lessons from Russia and lock up these Civil disrupts.
Respect for the citizens of Russia, and positive thoughts going out for the people of Ukraine.
It is RUSSIAN Citizen's fault. They voted him in in the first place. Once he got to power, he declared himself Dictator. They should have protested against that in the first place. They were complacent. They are seeing the result of it now.
Western MSM is very powerful. It can make right from wrong as people doesn't have much ability to think thoroughly.
I thought I was watching the trucker protests in Canada!
NO MORE WAR!!! NO MORE WAR!!! NO MORE WAR!!! NO MORE WAR!!! NO MORE WAR!!!
Someone should have told Putin he didn't get to make demands.
Sounds like both governments are not doing what the people want... sip on that
Everyday Russians are the ones who are gonna be affected by the sanctions
All these people gonna die in car crashes just like putins oppositions in elections 🤣
If you as a person are my enemy. As i know you are against me and you dont like me. And you try to get my neighbour to join you and to be in an alliance called NATO where you can send troops, guns, tanks, jets, misiles and everything you want in my neighbours house which is right next to me. Of course i will say to that neighbour if you join them, i will burn you as they are trying to get closer to me trough you. If that neighbour dont listen. I need to burn it in order to defend myself, my family and my home. Thats exactly what happened with NATO, Russia and Ukraine. I cant explain it any simplier. And i hope you realise. Russia is not attacking Ukraine. Russia is defending itself from NATO (US).
So proud of the Russian people for standing up against their president, against this war!
Long Live The Red Army ✊🏼⭐
Wow this is amazing
A majority of Russians in Russia do not support this war. But Russians in the Donbas region could not wait to be saved, they are happy. 8 years of war that killed 14K people were exhausting for them.
Keep protest, he cant prison everyone
Rise up Russias young people, Putin is murdering the Ukraine people
Demonstration against the government in Russia is illegal very happy they are risking their lives to do this and let the world know This is not the people's will.
The US is behind the rallies.they using people.dont be fooled by the west
My prayers with the protestors . The true hero of the upcoming war.   Your blood and sweat will not go in vain.  Putin needs to be stopped.  Stop the war.
Wow. I'm impressed I didn't think the Russian public would care. I was wrong
Glad they are protesting but, US media is only for protestors when it fits their narrative .. couch, couch.. freedom truckers
Good for Putin. Now he can destroy enemies both home and abroad.
Put a one billion dollar price on Putin’s head and see what happens. Come on Joe, get tough on the bully. Grab him by the balls.
Hahahahah this people  are in jail right now puttin put on jail. He's no joke
History keeps repeating itself
Putin will be replaced after the citizen's revolt grows larger and louder. The Oligarchs will not like to see their wealth plummet.
Putin and Russia showing USA and West countries their own medicine.  USA and Western countries used to treat other countries inferior
Police do that here to pro America protesters. You can burn and scream death to America for yrs though.
Hope they all stay safe. Know it's naive but these folk just want peace and there's nothing wrong with that.
Putler is a HITLER OF THE 21ST CENTURY.  HE HAS NO SUPPORT OF HIS PPL AND NOW HE NEEDS TO USE FORCE TO STOP HIS FAILURE AS A CZAR!!
The whole world should be agaist Putin
Wouldn't that be something -- if Putin overplayed his hand and this war is what finally unseats him?
How many of his own people will he murder today? Little Stalin.
Putin needs to give both Russia and Ukraine the peace that they deserve
Ukraine is a former motherland of USSR now Russia.you are connected with blood,why Putin hurt it's own people?
Yeah yeah .... 90% support putin and they show the 10% that dont ... Facking media
Any that protest will be jailed...period.
Glad to see they aren't trash like their leader
ive seen this man in STAR TREK
Putin needs to suffer an Osama Bin Laden fate.
GOD BLESS Russia
Anyone read Russian? I don't trust mainstream media
Meanwhile in America trump and maga conservatives praise, support, and love putin, prayers for Ukraine.
Thanks to these people there is some light 😢
Stupid Putting! We hate war!!!
Welp, those people are all dead
Putin needs to be eliminated.
He said. A war by the way that almost every russian insisted was impossible because they are brother nations. If they are brother nations why is ukraine trying to join NATO and not keeping with their ,,brother nation" Russia? What are you all talking about. Russia is bad. Russia russia. You are saying it yourself. But trying to turn the words against someone else. Think about your words. Because you are talking against yourselfs.
FU  AH
Reminds me of Canada
Go russian prople, tale down the Putin dictator! But take care
The US and UN should fund the protestors.
DAMN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KEEP PEACE AN THERE THW ONES GOING TO JAIL THAN PEOPLE THAT WANT WAR STEEL THEY'RE OUT IN THE STREETS FREE AND WHEELING AN WHAT THAY DO..... SICK AN SAD..... WATCH OUT THE PROTESTERS AND PEOPLE THE COPS ARE OUT TO GET YOU IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DO A GOOD THING.......!!!!!!! 🤦
This women needed her balloons in police car
Putin and his helpers dogs one day will face the Hague like Milosevic and the Nazis Nuremberg!
Good luck controlling a mad man
Trudeau should condemn this in St Petersburg, right?
spread love not hate, peace not war, reconciliation not vindictiveness….
God help them
"Call on the Lord in the day of trouble and he will deliver you."          - Psalm  50 :15
Im very proud of the Russian people protesting this, even though it risks their lives.  War is no longer the answer.  Peace to all and I hope this can be stopped before it destroys a lot of lives.
Since Australia and Canada went full blown oppressors against their citizens that were peacefully protesting, (unlike Black Lives Matter who did billions of dollars of damage, harmed and injured untold hundreds of people, committed arson by burning down hundreds of buildings and committed felony larceny by stealing everything from target and other stores like it.), Russian cops don’t look that bad. You have cops doing that to their citizens in Australia and Canada.  Of course Russian cops are bad. And the cops in Australia and Canada are horrible as well.
Don't worry Biden Austin and Milly will tweet and cancel all of Putin's social media....AND a sanction or two. Look out Putin you might loose your IG account!!!!
They can make a significant difference in this conflict. Thank you for standing for what's right.
God Bless Russian People, fight for what is right, war has no place in this world, give peace a chance
So what would actually stop the war? Like what exactly does he say?
Looks like Canada!
You can't arrest everyone !
Good for them for standing up for what’s right!
God protect those who just want peace and  unfortunately are caught in the middle! Good always triumphs over evil! 🕊️ WITH UKRAINE!!! 🇺🇦
DOn't give up Russian protestors!
thank you people of russia
My heart goes out to those in Ukraine and the ones in Russia who don't want this. So sad
Well now we know where the Ottawa police were trained.
Russians or Ukrainians the common people suffer
Salute to the people of russia join the protest against war!!!✌
These Russians are absolute heros.
I’m laying in bed !! Free and comfortable!! But please know I have been crying and begging GOD to intervene!! And stop that evil man!! Please GOD help them!! In JESUS CHRIST NAME AMEN
Putin will be seen all over the world as a pariah leader to the world just like Xi Jinping, and Kim Un Song. The support for him in russia will drop over time. He may have to resort to more internal suppression over time. Countries closest to  russia will just get militarily stronger. Countries like India will need to adjust any alliance. Same with China.
Good. my russian  friends. stop  the  insane  . americas  got u.
They are putting their lives on the line. That takes courage against a brutal dictator and his henchmen.
Ukraine and the Russian people have just came through a pandemic and now be thrown in too a War by a power hungry terrorist. I hope both nations stop this conflict and both focus on who the real enemy is , "PUTIN"
Nice you know what guys why even let Russia exist let America take it all that's basically what they are gonna do
The US likes wars but Russia can put an end to the US war hunger.
🥺🥺
Putin is the DEVIL, O NO THAT'S  TRUMP
A lot of holograms--a lot like Covid 19 when it broke--holograms of  doctors in white, elderly on ventilators, tubing running from face to  machines, etc. Getting boring this stuff, but deadly.
Ukraine is peaceful ✌️ not war!! President putin shall rethink that Ukraine are not the aggressive.....
Hey Macron I thought you assured the world Russia wouldn’t invade…. Guess ya’ll got duped for the 2nd time…. OUCH
What are we doing?? Come on!!! Its about the right to exist! Not to be ruled and executed but to stand and help those in need remember the oil in the lamps!!!!
no use protesting. you should be preparing to help the refugees from ukraine.  do something of value and stop wasting time protesting
I remember when Americans protested the invasions of Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria.  The people hate war, the governments can't get enough of it.
Remember Trump says Putin is a genius for doing this.
Rise up free people. Take down all autocratic regimes. From Trudeau to Putin to expert health fascists that want to lock down citizens. All corporate cronyism and mass mainstream media needs to be torn down. We the people for the people. Freedom. No war. Peace. That also includes the current leader of Ukraine who is no better than Putin. Taiwan is free. HongKong is free.
Wonderful!
Hopefully it helps
We stand with you Ukrainian and Russian brother and sisters!!
Hopefully ukrainians remain independent ...
The ordinary russians will suffer the crippling sanctions. War chest of putin and his oligarchs can maybe sustain for about 3 to 5 years. Then they will be like North Koreans.. people are starving, heavily taxed... the future is grim for these lovely people.
This crack down looks just like what Trudeau is doing in Canada
The Russian People are speaking, they need to protest even more. It's their People that will be killed in Ukraine. The Russian people needs to speak up and move on taking there country back. They need to stop being cowards and stand up to teriney. Taking over a People by force will not make them agree on anything with you.
What is up with your lower eyelashes?
Brave Russians!
Putin said it was just a fringe minority and they were white supremacists.
The WORLD needs to step up and stop Putin's regime.
Let there be peace ON Earth and let it begin with us...
Russian Citizens will be facing the consequences of this not Putin himself. Putin lost his mind.
No difference than what the west does. Canada anybody
Don't create the propaganda .
Only russians can stop Putin. People want peace.
*one town then another... one nation then another... (???) They're just watching while R is moving... (?)* 🤔😓
we'll see putin's true colors in response to Russia up in protest.
That’s how to arrest like real police
I thought I was watching the news from Canada when I saw all the protesters being arrested.  Russians don’t have human rights either.
You must take down this madman from within or you will lose any dignity and quality of life…children ..tell your fathers to end Putin’s reign…
Sanctions hitting different
People that are arrested, are they doomed?
May God bless and protect these brave people. Thank you for your courage.
If you’re the president of a country or state and you make a decision and your people do not support your decision shouldn’t you stop but God may be with the Ukrainian people please protect
Nobody wants war !
Waiting for a mushroom cloud.
Ads on this channel by Ron Johnson are as fictitious as Putin's smear campaign and agression against Ukraine.
The True Heroes will be the Russians who SAVE Ukraine.
Awesome stay strong Russia
Back in the US back in the USSR U don't know how like you are.
Hey tRUMP supporters  your hero Putin  needs your help on controlling  the protesters
Really disgusted with war, hope people are all well, my prayers for you，I wish I could do more！
My god, Russia is looking more and more like Canada.
The thing is the same thing that happened to the Anti War protesters in the USA and around the world..  It never works,, the protesters will only end up in jail..
Putin is a criminal and coward. I’m sure he’s sitting safe somewhere in the middle of Russia in a bunker.
I HATE war, these politicians think they're doing a great job for their country but they don't think about innocent people that dies.
Where was coverage of this attitude when USA attacked Iraq????
He has about as much support as Biden does
My heart goes out to Ukraine  people were ever you all are may God continue to guide you all Putin will meet his Maker soon wicked man
Putin is real Evil.
Ex KGB man what can you expect from him, he was obviously bored with life as it is in Russia so he must have thought I will start a war it will keep me amused., sick man.
This doesn't smell good for Putin. Too much of the same soup has less effect. He sounds like a man pleading to the oligarchs for patience with his madness.
Be strong and stay brave…Ukrainians need your voice! Where you at God let’s go! Sure could use you on this one…
The protesters are the true heros
It's the Western Media that's instigating these few protestors in a number of left wing onclaves
The world is against Putin.  He screwed not only the Ukraine, but the Russian people.
FreeUkraine
👎Putin 👻❌👎 👹☠️💀 Putin 👎❌
These are youngsters who do not even know what a war is and who just want to have some fun in the streets.
Putin is next Hitler, they should of gotten rid of the monster along time ago.
Protesting does not have any effect
Typical FAKE NEWS. I know the language. They are chanting "Let's Go Brandon" in Russian.
Its fine, that protest is full of people who don't understand there won't be no war. Only the full take of Ukraine. The other countries won't move a finger. There's always that kind of people in every country
Wonder how crew of ISS are reacting
The true bravery of the Russian people can help stop Putin! As tuff as it is protests help.
Putin is very close friends with Prince Albert II of Monaco who also knighted Putin. Monte Carlo is a major money laundering headquarters for the Russian Mafia. The royals of Monaco the House of Grimaldi were originally Genoese nobles and rulers of the Republic of Genoa which ruled the Black Sea region and had leverage over Russia for centuries by controlling trade. Don Domenico Pallavacino of Genoa is Consul General of Monaco. The Pallavacinis originated as Genoese nobles and bankers and today are Roman princes and international bankers as well as Russian bankers and economists. Don Giancarlo Pallavacini of Milan was a Soviet economic advisor and is today a Russian economist. Margrave Alphonse Pallavacini of Austria the brother in law to the Queen of Belgium has been a top executive for Paribas Russia for about 15 years. The Savoys are married with the Genoese Doria family currently with Princess Marina. The Dorias were Doges and bankers of the Republic of Genoa. Prince Aimone of Savoy Aosta runs Pirelli Russia and has had documented photographed meetings with Putin. Prince Aimones sister Princess Bianca is married with the Arrivabene Valenti Gonzaga family who have married with Russian royals. The Romanovs are married with Roman Aristocracy recently including the Gaetanis. The Romanovs have 3 royal branches living in America today and another branch in Spain, Germany, UK, and Italy. The royals of Monaco are married with the German Hanovers with Prince Ernst August the husband of Princess Caroline of Monaco who are also currently married with Russian royals with Princess Alexandra of Hanover married to Prince Andreas of Leinengen whose mother was the Grand Duchess of Russia. These are Putin's bosses and they need to be hunted down and executed for war crimes.

THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAVE TO FEAR IS FEAR ITSELF!!!! - FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
Brave souls. This tyrant must be tried in international courts for crimes against humanity just like all those who helped Hitler in WWII..
Traitors.
Putin is a terrorist now.
Well, THAT  is a mostly peaceful protest, MSM.
The war in Ukraine would end 8 years ago if Ukraine would gave up on the separated land...But nooo....and let Nato load Ukraine with weapons against Russian people in separated land... they have been shelling separated land for 8 years. Finally Putin had enough.
Mostly protest of rich cities which do not represent the underdeveloped majority of the population which roots with the president like it or not. Sad they got arrested.
