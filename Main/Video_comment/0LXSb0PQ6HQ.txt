Is that Adam Lustick from Corporate and Harvard Sailing Team?? weirdly makes me want to eat peanut butter
Shows the age bracket of most YouTubers… 😂
Wow, they really have all the A-listers, even Keith Leak Jr!
there is still a spark there
They got Ross and Rachel together in an ad and this is how they used them :')
<><>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>> A man named Jesus forgave us of all wrongs. He's the son of God. God is the created of everything in this existence. Breathe air. To life.
Hmm..  They are living in Joe Bidens world.  He forgets mostly everything, and joe doesn't order Uber eats.   Bzzzt, short circuit in memmory.
what if cancer, dementia, Alzheimer's and research into lengthening human health span got all this advertising money rather than "celebs"/adult pretenders. or go old school and care for widows, orphans and feed the sick and minister to prisoners.   also most food now is seed oils not organic gmo and causes diabetes creating lifetime customers for the pharma cabal.  a lot of the foods being pushed out by uber eats and others is made in ghost kitchens which often have horrible records for health and safety and use terrible ingredients sourced bottom dollar by places like SYSCO. all this food is causing obesity and diabetes.
I thought they were going to take the peanut butter part out.
Who TF is Keith?
Annnnd now it’s pulled for peanuts
Thats hilarious!
That was funny, get over it and go back to you're safe place (NOT)
favorite part is the peanut butter guy 😆
Omg this is great 😂
Jen, David, YOU WERE ON A BREAK!!!!
KEITH LEAK JR ❤❤❤❤
Don't forget David S hates white people.
They should have kept the peanut butter skit. It's all awareness, even in jokes. And that's a pretty good representation of what it looks like too before the throat closing part. 10 year OIT grad here and still holding.
horrible
Who is Keith and how did he get so many friends?!!
This is the commercial so many got butt-hurt about??  What the natural f€%*!??
Oh that's why uber pays drivers pennies! Because they have stadiums to name and super bowl commercials to buy.    Uber screws the drivers with pathetic pay, screws the customers with insane sneaky and unfair fees while trying to pretend much of it goes to drivers (it doesn't), screws the restaurants with crazy percentage take and even screws their offshore "support" staff while laughing all the way to the bank and execs cashing their hundreds of millions salary package checks.
Who is Keith, why’s everyone commenting about him
Came here bc the NY times reported that some group of people were offended (sure they were 🙄) by this ad bc it allegedly made fun of people with peanut allergies. Lol. So ubereats cut out that part of the video. They really are pushing this censorship this far, at every turn. It’s so obvious what’s going on. They’re conditioning us to take  offense at everything to get rid of free speech and to distract us from they’re global agenda. It sounds ridiculous to spell it out, but it’s so blatantly obvious
Trump is to bush as genz is to Millennials.    Both sucked but wow you took sucking to a whole new level
YES KEITH!  Also Jelly Roll was hilarious
YEAAAAAHHHH OUR BOY BOOKED!!!
I was redirected to this ad because there's “backlash” over a commercial built around humor.   We disregard essential matters, but yes, evidently, this is the line too far gone.
That 3 seconds of peanut butter really caused that big of a backlash that they’re going to delete this? People need to get over themselves and learn to take a joke. It’s not like the guy was actively dying from eating the peanut butter!
Pleasw the ad up, dont give in to internet bullies. People are too sensative these days
We lrrrrfff Jesssicsaa
Go on Keith!!!
So this is the commercial everybody's offended about? I'm just trying to see what's there to make anyone mad.
To all the cry babies crying about the peanut allergy.... STFU and get a sense of humor 😅
only 12%fees. yee
Omg Keith?!?!
KEITH LEAK JR.🫵
KEITH KEITH KEITH KEITH!
Why does Jeniifer Aniston and Victoria Beckham look so... rubbery?
Glad to see Keith booked it after recovering from cancer
Lets go Keith!
BIG KEITH but also Friends reunion?
HE BOOKED
I’m so glad everyone else is here for Keith too 😂
Was this when Keith kept posting fashion stories to instagram....😂
Order from the shop directly if possible!
we love to see it keith !!
KEITH!!!!!! 🎉
Is the bg music a slowed down "dumb dumb" tiktok song?  Also KEITH BOOKED!! ❤❤
Look at our man, Keith from Smosh. He’s on a Super bowl ad!! I’m so happy for him and I’m so happy that nobody else has noticing any other celebrity but they’re all talking about Keith. Congratulations man you deserve it
Apparently the "peanut butter allergy community" is furious about this ad and is calling to boycott Uber Eats over this
That was cute. Not hilarious, but cute. Definitely not offensive to the "food allergy community" lmao
Oh my gosh tell my lover meryl streep i love her this comedy is killing me
Food brought to you in a filthy car by someone who doesn’t care about his job. Idiots
Jennifer Anniston just looks like 90s Shawn Michaels now
KEITH!!!!!
Here for Keith much love man!
keith 💗💗💗
Ross and rachel forever
Weirdly this feels like an ad that looking back is lowkey distopian love you tho keith
Those with food allergies are weak. Do better
LETS GOOOOO KEITH!!!
AHHHH KEITH!!! HE BOOKED!!!!
Keith Booked !!! Congrats Keith. Also food allergies are not a joke . Says a lot about you Ubereats.
I am here for David and Jennifer❤ My Ross and Rachel !! ♾️
Keith is white!!!
Keith!! Let's go!!
There's peanuts in peanut butter? OH!!! It's the primary ingredient."   How is it offensive? He isn't shown growing a rash, being sent away in an ambulance or going into shock. No tombstone.
Yes KEITH!!!
Funny. This is not "tone deaf". Many want their problems to be yours. Sick of the the over sensitive Woke culture. Life can be hard so get use to it. Being resilient is a virtue and will help many get through life without crying.....
Yay! Keith!!!
HEEEYYY KEEIITTHH 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
WOOOOOO KEITH
KEITH
Best commercial I’ve seen this year, can’t believe there’s snowflakes trying to cancel it over a peanut butter jokes..
HE BOOKED HE BOOKED!!!
KEITH SO PROUD OF THAT MANNNNNNNNNMMM
Omg it's Keith Leak Jr.! And a bunch of randos
OMG!! KEITH!!!❤😍
Finally. Great ad!
Keith booked!
WAY TO GO KIETH!
Go, Keith, go! 💖
I love the keith part but i dont get the joke
Ok i'm also here bc omg Keith booked, but also hearing the song dumb dumb by Mazie in a commercial is wild, it broke containment from the animation meme community and I was not ready to hear it outside of my playlist-
KEITH LEE?! OMG LETS GOOO
Keith killed it.
I DIDN’T KNOW KEITH WAS IN THIS COMMERCIAL
Peanut butter guy was hilarious!
KEITHHH
This c9mmercial has been changed because a bunch ot whiney sensitive snowflakes got offended by the peanut butter part
KEITH !!!!!
Congratulations Keith!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
keith is so good omg
Keith Leak Jr babyyyyyyy
KEITH!!! SO FUNNY AND GREAT DELIVERY 😉🥹 CONGRATS KEITH!!
Im sorry but what the heck is the outrage over a peanut butter joke about. It was a simple joke. People really try their hardest to take offense over literally anything nowadays
Wait can he not sit cause he forgot how to sit or cause he had testicular cancer? 😭
who are all these people in keith’s commercial
A yes Groceries and Alcohol, both things I get and Keith advocates. ❤
YESSS KEITH!!!! we love u!!!
That’s funny, especially the peanut butter guy. But I still won’t order anything with Uber Eats.
AND he was on an AM Pm commercial
Yesss Keith!!! Get that bag!
HE BOOKED!!!!
KEITH !!!!!
Literally just here for Keith Leak Jr
I don’t get the controversy about the peanut allergy. It’s a JOKE not about the allergy but about how something so important as that was forgotten to remember Uber has so much stuff. It’s harmless and good natured and anyone taking offense is itself offensive to the wider community
The Peanut Butter allergic guy will be edited out on tomorrows ad after the "Food allergy advocates called out this commercial to remove a peanut allergy joke."  Oh FFS....calm down! 🙄
SHE BOOKED!!!
“A what?” SUCH GOOD ACTING WELL DONE KEITH
The peanut butter thing was great funny. Yes, peanut alergies are serious and can be fatal...but this is a joke about forgetting something important, and It's funny. If you don't find it funny, too bad for you. Maybe you need to remove the pickle from yoyr bottom and get a sense of humor. Many other things in the world to worry about right now more than indignation over a 2 second clip of a guy forgetting he is allergic to peanut butter. Just because you joke about something doesn't make it less serious. Anyone with 2 brain cells still knows that peanut allergies are serious. We're allowed to joke about serious things. It's called black or dark humor. If you're  too sensitive about it, turn off your TV and stay in your house until you have a thick enough skin to rejoin society.
Imagine crying about an ad because of jokes. Grow up😂😂😂😂
“Loser Eats” caves in to pearl-clutchers over the anaphylaxis part… Have we seriously no sense of humour at all?
WOOO CONGRATS KEITH🎉🎉🎉
Keith!!! 🎉
Congrats Keith!!

Im convinced Keith just wandered on set while they were filming like it is a sub quest
This ad minimizes the severity of having allergies and is completely tone deaf when it comes to people who struggle or know people who struggle with memory loss. Big L

HE BOOKEDDD
HE BOOKED!
Nicely played, Uber Eats. What a stunt. You've got the worldwide allergy community eating out of your hand now that you've agreed to edit this ad before Sunday, without issuing a single word of explanation or apology. But wasn't that the plan all along? No such thing as bad publicity, right?
KEITH MY GUYYYY
Keith!!!!
Iam not watching any superbowl commercials until the superbowl is here.
YES KEITH BOOKEDDDDD
Keith !!! He BOOKED
First he beat cancer, and now he got booked!  Congratulations, Keith!!!
Keith!!!!!
without Jennifer Aniston this commercial would be boring too longdrawn.
KEEEEEIIIITH
This commercial was an absolute roller coaster. They need to do a react and review with a full summary. I may be half baked when saying this, but I just know they'll love the idea.
Congrats to Keith!!
Keith!
So proud of keith

Here's an ad idea for botox: "Botox! It can make Aniston and Efron look exactly the same." Here's one for fillers: "Fillers! We promise you, no one will be able to tell your gender, ethnicity, age or species."
I love keith
Keith!!!!🎉
This commercial is particularly insensitive to individuals and caregivers dealing with Alzheimers and other dementias- coupled with Uber's insensitivity to peanut allergies, they really missed the mark on this one

Which generation are you crushing over Keith jr. Cuz m zen z still m here for friends❤
keith
ok, I'll be "that guy"... all of these little jokes are harmless fun... forgot pants, forgot your colleague, forgot a chair etc. but the guy who forgets his peanut allergy having welts all over his face when peanut allergies are known as one of the most potentially severe life threatening allergies and some die every year from it... that should be out of bounds and its not funny for those of us living with this threat. I know people are sometimes tired of hearing from peanut allergy folks, but it's all fun and games until you are riding with your child in an ambulance as they struggle to breathe.
Ross, Rachel and Keith Leak Jr. Power trifecta!
Obviously, Jen and David are hilarious, but JellyRoll had me 🤣😂🤣😂
Keith Leak Jr. booked!

Congrats Keith!
Any time I need something I can either get it myself or have it delivered by a delivery service that isn't charging as much as you are.. It's not that I forget about Uber Eats, it's just that you are consistently the worst option.

Food allergies are not a joke! 1 in 13 children have food allergies. 1 in 3 are bullied because of it. (To the point where children have died) . You are giving further ammunition to these bullies. Please cut the allergy part of the commercial before the super bowl. My 2 year olds life threatening disability (food allergies are considered a disability)  should not be the butt of a joke! A company that handles food should not make jokes about food allergies.  Do better!
The goat Keith Leak Jr!!!!!!!

Disappointed to see Uber Eats making light of food allergies.
I will no longer be using Uber eats since you think my life threatening peanut allergy is a joke 😡
I won’t forget called Uber for a ride to my ortho doc and they wanted to charge me $68 for a 2 mile ride.  I canceled the appointment and forgot about Uber.
God bless everyone who reads this comment and will let me even subscribe to you 🙏
A company the delivers food….making a joke of food allergies…wonder how that came up in the ideation session or the liability it creates… 0:38
What a classy lady. Just beautiful
i like the beckams's teaser more than this
I just got out of the hospital for an allergic reaction could yall stop thinking allergies are funny. Fkin idiots
A girl died recently from mislabeled food containing nuts. It's not funny and anyone with an allergy would never react like that.
Remove the peanut butter clip and stop using severe food allergies as a cheap laugh. You are part of the huge problem and why people with food allergies can’t be taken seriously. Do better.
'Oh it's the primary ingredient'. lol
"Paprika Girls" LOL funny AF
Food allergies are not a joke. They can be serious and life threatening. My beautiful sister Órla died recently from mislabeled food. What an insult to her memory this is.
Food allergies are not a joke.
Lighten up..
Peanut butter guy 😂
Eyo Keith Leak Jr I see you my boy!!!
Always great when a multinational company makes fun of life threatening allergies....  Shame on you Uber.
Making fun of people with potentially life threatening allergies and ignoring the professional organizations that are asking them to edit - not pull - edit that section out.  And Uber Eats ignoring it because their marketing people are fine with it because the controversy will get them more views.  They will get super bowl views and they will get more time on the news for the controversy - and that is a win for the ad companies.  And a loss for children and adults who live with real allergy risks.
How much more money does this woman need? 😂
For the peanut allergy scene it would be so incredibly important if there was a reminder about the allergy option in the app. I didn't mind the scene because it brought awareness to how extreme a reaction people can have to allergies. We just had a food delivery where we specifically requested the allergy-free version of a food, and the wrong one was picked and delivered by mistake. (I'm not blaming Uber. It was a food delivery by Whole Foods and I'm not sure who picked and delivered it.)  The packaging of the food was very similar and we did not catch it in  time. Thank God for EpiPen and 911. Maybe Uber Eats can do a campaign bringing more awareness to this very important topic.
Hi today I lost my bag in Uber three vheeler in chennai.  I can’t contact my driver how do I claim that? Pls help me to find that
Omg Keith booked
Really NOT ok to make a joke out of a LIFE THREATENING illness like food allergies. You should really cut that scene because it is EXTREMELY offensive and harmful to the food allergy community. Food allergies are a disease not a diet. If you need to do some more research I recommend looking at FARE, a non profit trying to bring awareness to food allergies since Ubereats obviously did not. Let’s move past using a medical condition as a joke.
As a marketer, you fumbled this ad. Making light/fun of life-threatening food allergies is not okay. No one is laughing. Especially those of us who struggle and have family members/children who could literally die if they eat their allergen. I’m disappointed and how this got approved/through the ranks baffles me.
Food allergies are not funny. Making a joke of this is distasteful and sending a harmful message. Cannot believe that Uber Eats or the television network signed off on this. 😡
This  commercial had so much potential, but allergies ARE NOT A JOKE. people die from them all the time!
Food allergies aren’t a joke, people DIE from their allergies. This type of representation only makes it easier for people to think it’s “just a peanut” or worse “see how serious it is” and intentionally contaminate someone’s food.
Cut out the joke about food allergies and you have a funny commercial....my daughter has life threatening food allergies along with 33 million other Americans, food allergies are a disease NOT a joke.....
Just had my Uber account hack and stole all my money from my uber pro card was told I have to wait 10 business days just to get a update and up to 90 days to see what there going to do , 100% inside job , the phone call was from the Uber number that always calls , they knew all my information, phone number , email , the trip i was going to and my last trip I did as well , now I have no money to feed my kids or to pay tomorrow the weekly rental fee $363 to continue working 🤦🏻‍♂️ I truly hope this doesn’t happen to nobody not cool at all
She is disgusting she doesn't deserve anything. 🤮
My kids are allergic to peanuts. It’s not a joke and it’s a pretty gross look to convey something that kills so many children and adults yearly as a joke.
Well done ad ruined by the tone deaf approach of mocking food allergies. For folks watching this ad I want you to know that everyday there are more than 33M+ children / adults that can die just from coming in contact with their food allergen. Thanks @uber @ubereats for making it even harder for folks living with their disease of anaphylactic food allergies. Pull the ad and have your marketing team meet with FARE to rebound from the backlash.
Uber Eats, in today’s society you’d think you would know better. It’s disheartening to say the least. Food allergies can be FATAL. And have taken many innocent lives. You’re encouraging FA bullying while making light of a very serious condition. With the poor taste, there is the bad timing as, Orla Baxendale, a young woman who died recently from her peanut allergy. AND The Mahomes’ youngest was recently diagnosed with a peanut allergy as well. Edit and remove that bit. It isn’t needed and it DEFINITELY IS NOT FUNNY. I think of all of the loved ones who have lost someone to food allergy seeing that while watching tv. Horrible.
Disgrace to make a medical condition that people die from into a joke! You wouldnt joke about cancer!!! Ye had an opportunity to promote and help those who suffer with allergies instead you made a joke of them. Disgusting.
They were Still On a Break 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
SEE, HE IS HER LOBSTER ......😊😊😊😁😁😁😁😉😉😉
Are these people famous or something?
How disappointing that a company entrusted with delivering food would make fun of food allergies in a Super Bowl commercial! In 2024 there should be more understanding and acknowledgment of the seriousness of food allergies. They are life threatening, not a choice - anaphylaxis is not a joke. Do better Uber Eats. I certainly would not trust or recommend having this company deliver food as they clearly do not take food allergies seriously and that would make me question other aspects of their driver requirements.
I still hope they get together...i love David and Jen!
Absolutely disgusting- making fun of food allergies, especially nut allergies is highly offensive and inappropriate.
This would have been a great commercial until they decided to make fun of a serious life-threatening disability. How very “WOKE” of them. From now on we can all expect their commercials to be making a joke of Autism, Downs Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, people in wheelchairs, paraplegics, etc. because it’s clearly their thing to joke about disabilities. I am sure Patrick Mahomes and his family will find it funny given their son is allergic to peanuts.  I am sure the family of the young beautiful girl who just lost her life a month ago from a mislabeled cookie will find it absolutely hilarious. Food allergies are a disability not a diet and most certainly NOT a joke. Idiots!!!
There are so many other jokes you could have made — Why did you have to choose food allergies? As the mom of two kids who could DIE if they came in contact with their allergens, I’m disappointed that you’re using what we go through on a daily basis as the butt of a joke about to be broadcast to millions of people…
33 million suffer from food allergies in America- read the room Uber eats
Boycotting Uber eats for making fun of food allergies
Sabes as lo q tu crees te ase feliz si todos ya te conocen 😊
Food delivery company makes a joke about food allergies. Definition of Tone Deaf. Shame on you.
Nice fanyy video so cute
I love the show friends. But I'll go to the store and save 50%  vs having it delivered thank you.
Funny
0:38 Food allergies are not a joke. This is not funny.
You know actors are doing bad when they’re doing Uber commercials just like FTX…. Uber is a global fraud
Uber eats 🤮
No UBER EATS in my unique town - any suggestions??
Meh. 4/10. Felt like you relied on the celebrity and less on the comedy
There is nothing funny about someone having an allergic reaction to food. Beyond disappointing from a company who should know better.
Really confused as to why you guys think making fun of a life threatening food allergy is a joke? it’s triggering not funny. be apart of the change im begging you, not part of the problem. not part of the reason why my PTSD and many others’ is triggered.
Why would you make fun of a life threatening condition as part of this ad?!?! It would have been just as funny without that bit. Instead, you make the 33 million people with a chronic condition (food allergies) the butt of your joke. Would you make fun of people with cancer? I think not.
Food allergies are not funny. My child is anaphylactic to dairy and eggs, a life threatening medical condition. Not cool Uber Eats.
Think of all the ignorant corporate A holes that had to greenlight this dumb commercial that makes fun of a life threatening condition. Great job morons and you're a company that DELIVERS FOOOODDDD. So many moron executives it's not even funny.
I misheard paprika girls for the pretty girls and laughed so hard when Beckham said "No, that's absurd."
As someone who deals with food allergies, I find it incredibly disappointing and insensitive that Uber Eats would use a life-threatening condition as a punchline in their Super Bowl commercial. Food allergies are not a joke, and making light of them in an attempt to get laughs is in poor taste and teaches incorrect principles to youth about bullying people with disabilities. Instead of making fun of such a critical health issue, Uber Eats could use its platform to raise awareness and educate the public about the challenges faced by those with food allergies. What if they showed an example of Uber Eats accommodating someone with food allergies instead of poking fun at it? It's time for the entertainment industry to stop using food allergies as a source of humor and instead promote understanding and corporation.
This ad really puts into perspective how much Uber Eats doesn’t care about food allergies. I mean I could already tell by how hard it is to even indicate or check for allergens within the app but making it a joke in a Super Bowl ad is another level.  I have personally had anaphylaxis and it is no joke. I do not wish it upon my worst enemy.
I do mukbangs on my channel !! I'm new if you wanna check it out ❤
Ginger does mukbangs on my channel ❤
Would have been a great ad if they would have left out the food allergy part. Incredibly insensitive.
DON’T FORGET UBER EATS that food allergies are not a joke.
DON’T FORGET UBER EATS that food allergies are not a joke.
Don’t make jokes about allergies. They can be life threatening.
As a mother of a son who has experienced anaphylaxis to a peanut exposure, I am disgusted Ubereats would make fun of a very serious health condition
This commercial kind of makes me sick to my stomach. My son is allergic to peanuts and it’s not even a little bit funny… ever. Imagery like this makes people take food allergies less serious and is so harmful to those who have them! DO BETTER. Come up with a better joke!!
Don't forget. God so loved the world that He gave His only Son (Jesus Christ) that whoever believes in Him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Receive Christ and believe today the consequences are eternal!
Definitely bi men
This commercial should be removed. More than 30 million Americans suffer from food allergies and it’s nothing to joke about. Food allergies should be taken very seriously as they can be life threatening.
Food allergies aren’t a joke. As a parent that’s sat in an ambulance while her child struggles to breathe from a nut allergy, this is disheartening. My son can’t change having food allergies. Do better.
A 25 year old women died from a severe peanut allergy after it wasn’t labeled in the ingredients section after they changed the recipe. IT IS NOT A JOKE!!! So disappointed in UberEats
Keith from Smosh🙌✨
@mikechappell2560 What about this? When she walks away someone hands him his Uber order while he's saying, "Wow after playing her brother for 10 years!  That way it doesn't contradict the commercial's concept but supports it.😊
This ad was so light hearted and funny until the segment on the allergic reaction in which it went downhill fast. You should be embarrassed Uber Eats for mocking a disability.
Low blow, @UberEats. Life threatening food allergies are a legitimate disability covered by the ADA. If you wouldn’t make a joke at the expense of a person in a wheelchair or someone with diabetes, why would you ever think it’s appropriate to mock people with food allergies? Maybe ask Patrick Mahomes if it’s funny since his family manages multiple food allergies - he’ll be playing in the game during which you plan to run this ad. What simpleton approved this as part of a legitimate marketing strategy? Sheesh.
Making food allergies a joke perpetuates the struggles and daily dangers people with life threatening allergies face. The insensitive and dangerous joke about peanut allergies should be edited out. There’s time to make it right.
I didn't like that Jennifer didn't recognise him... But I won't say anything because she is simply beautiful and adorable 🤩. Love you Jenn
Peanut allergies should not be included in this. It's a life threatening disease and a triggering concept to put on display. Stop using food allergies for humor.
Making fun of someone allergic to something is not funny
Food allergies are not a laughing matter. They are very serious and should be taken as such. Very poor taste.
KEITH BOOKED !!!!!!
It's disappointing to see Uber Eats make light of food allergies in their Super Bowl ad. Food allergies are a serious condition that many people have to navigate every day. Let's promote empathy and understanding, instead of making jokes at the expense of those affected by food allergies.
How dare you make fun of someone with food allergies 😡
So why is a food delivery service joking about food allergies? It doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence that people are receiving safe meals when declaring their allergens or food sensitivities…
Not sure why Uber Eats, a food delivery company, thinks anaphylaxis from peanut allergies is funny. It’s really punching down and perpetuating a stereotype that food allergies are some kind of diet rather than a life threatening disease. Good to know you don’t take it seriously, so I can never, ever use your service.
This was funny until the ignorant and dangerous joke about a peanut allergy. UberEats ... you are a company that deals with FOOD! What are you thinking?! How dense. What an oversight. It's "jokes" like this that perpetuate misconceptions about the severity and seriousness of food allergies. People die from this. Patrick Mahomes, you know... the star of the Super Bowl this commercial is set to air in.... his infant son was just diagnosed with a peanut allergy. The Mahomes JUST did a fundraiser for F.A.R.E. Cut the segment out, fill the time with something actually funny. Issue an apology to those with and who care for people with food allergies. Donate to F.A.R.E. Educate yourselves and hire someone in HR to quality check your poor ideas. Good grief.
Food allergies are NOT a punchline. As a nurse I urge you and your team to educate yourselves about the burden and devastation of food allergies. Uber Eats can and must do better. The commercial would be just fine without the clip poking fun at a life-threatening disability.
❤❤❤
Anyone else realize that that's freaking Keith from smosh🤣♥️♥️♥️
The reaction to peanut butter is not funny and has nothing to do with forgetting your co-star, the band that you were in, or the fact that you're in a half-time show.   A very short time ago a dancer in New York died after eating a cookie that was not labeled with peanuts.  It's insensitive and in poor taste.
Food allergies are not a joke. You wouldn’t make a joke about forgetting somebody had diabetes. You wouldn’t make a joke about forgetting somebody had cancer. You wouldn’t make a joke about forgetting somebody was missing a limb. None of this is funny.
Not cool, @Ubereats, not cool. Food allergies are not funny and should not be taken lightly.
0:00 Hilarious 😂😂❤❤ Perhaps we’re missing something on the food allergy segment. Ross was allergic to Kiwi. IDK Look for the good of this Uber ad and laugh a little. 😊
As a food company how is this ok? Food allergies aren't made up, it isnt a tv show or a fairytale. Its a real life disease that is life threatening. Did you not just see in the news how someone just died from a peanut allergy. How insensitive and wrong is this to try and profit over such an insensitivity. Unless you are trying to tell the food allergy community and everyone for that matter that your company isn't to ve trusted. Do better, acknowledge your mistake and change the ad.
Why does the media always use food allergies for jokes? It’s not funny. If you or someone you love had a life threatening food allergy, I don’t think you would joke about it. It is shocking to me how little people understand the severity of food allergies to begin with. Ads like this just further the ignorance of the general public. It puts the idea in peoples minds that allergic reactions are trivial and something funny when in reality they are terrifying.   Who okayed this commercial? Please think this through.
Food allergies are not a joke!!! Nothing about this is funny. Would you make fun of ANY other medical condition? Try again Uber eats. You failed.
@UberEats, please do better. Food allergies are not a joke. Please pull the segment out of the commercial before it airs on Sunday. My children’s life-threatening disease should not be taken lightly.
I'm deathly allergic to dairy, eggs, peanuts and tree nuts, and I have almost died 3 times from my allergic reactions - thank you Uber eats for reminding me that I should use Skip The Dishes next time I order!
I am disgusted that Uber Eats would make a joke about a life-threatening medical condition. Unlike other medical conditions, our survival depends on the cooperation of our community. Ads like this that depict allergies are a joke are the reason people don’t take our condition seriously. People DIE, children DIE. And you think it’s something to laugh at. You wouldn’t make fun of a diabetic who forgot their insulin? Or an asthmatic who forgot their inhaler? So why would you make fun of someone with a life-threatening food allergy? Please edit this scene out, there’s still time. Do better.
Take it down. Food allergies are serious and not to be taken lightly.
if this comment get 10k likes Uber is gunna give me $10k USD or something idc maybe it’ll work?
I will definitely be forgetting about Uber eats…
Food allergies are not a joke!
It’s really a shame you used your platform to mock life threatening food allergies. If the man in your commercial “forgot” he was allergic to peanuts,  he’d be dead. Maybe educate your employees on how food allergies are protected under the American’s with Disabilities Act. How 1 in 10 adults had a life threatening food allergy or how 1 in 13 kids has a life threatening food allergy.  What you have done is used your platform to damage the work Food Allergy Research and Education has done to inform people about how dangerous food allergies are. For people who are ignorant to it are especially dangerous to children who cannot advocate for themselves. All it takes is one adult in school not taking a child’s life threatening allergic reaction seriously for that child to die.   Maybe you could release a commercial in the month of May educating people about Food Allergies, using phrases like “Epi first, Epi fast” since that is what you need to do for a reaction like the one you mocked.   Do better.
Thanks
Food allergies are life-threatening for many people. Joking about peanut butter, when peanuts are one of the most common food allergies, disrespects those who suffer and it discredits the allergy community who has spent so much time trying to educate others. Do better @ubereats! Please pull this advertisement.
There is absolutely NOTHING funny about severe food allergies.
You just lost a whole lot of customers. Peanut allergy’s are never a joke. I will never use Ubereats again!
Life threatening food allergies are not something to joke about! They are already not taken seriously enough as is, tastless videos like this will just make things worse.
FOOD ALLERGIES ARE NOT A JOKE I COULD DIE IF I EAT A PEANUT. Shame on you Uber Eats, shame on you. I'll never be using your service because you don't seem to care about millions of people's lives that were lost to an allergic reaction.
Dumb is the new smart
Was wondering why the like to dislike ration was like this...and I've never seen softer people in my life. Comedy would be dead if the world was this soft. So I thank you for staying in your small corners of the internet. Because I like comedy...and peanut butter.
OMG IT’S KEITH!!! GO KEITH!!
Food allergies are NOT a joke. This is disgusting and abhorrent.
This type of advertising opens people with food allergies to bullying & ridicule. Food allergies are a disease and a food delivery service that mocks the 1 in 13 children who suffer from it should not be trusted with food handling. Do better and edit this ad.
Bruh I just said this I door dash and I'm trying to get on grub hub I heard some positives
The peanut bit was a little insensitive. Just leave food allergies out of stuff like this. It's not funny.
Food allergies are not funny. It’s not funny rushing to the ER while your toddler is puking in the backseat from the epipen. Shame on you guys.
KEITH!!!
Haha this was funny AF start to finish.  Well done Uber; on occasion I take advantage of your generous delivery promo discounts.
Not sure why Uber Eats, a food delivery company, thinks anaphylaxis from peanut allergies is funny. It’s really punching down and perpetuating a stereotype that food allergies are some kind of diet rather than a life threatening disease. Good to know you don’t take it seriously, so I can never, ever use your service.
Food allergies are NOT A JOKE!! Do better.
This is embarrassing and should be pulled from the broadcast. Making fun of food allergies (a life threatening condition) isn’t the least bit funny. You should be ashamed and rest assured those of us in the food allergy community will NOT be using Uber eats anytime soon. Shame.
‪What next?  Make jokes about people with disabilities? Oh wait! You already have!‬  ‪Food allergies are generally considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities act.  ‬  ‪Don’t be insensitive. Cut out the part with the peanut allergy.‬
Food allergies are not a joke. Shame on Uber Eats.
HE BOOKED!
🤣
Food allergies are not a joke! Severe food allergies can be life threatening and to see a major marketing campaign use this as a joke is disheartening and wrong. This joke is insensitive and flat out wrong on so many levels. Instead of using this ad to make a joke about a critical health issue. This could have been a platform for awareness and advocacy around the issue. Or just stick to the Friends jokes. That’s what people want anyway.
What did Jennifer do to her face? Schwimmer looks different. The Friends reunion was just a few years ago. What happened?
It lost all appeal after making fun of food allergies. Making light of something that is deadly to those that have them is not acceptable.
Disappointed in Uber Eats, a company built  around food delivery, for joking about food allergies.  The 33 MILLION Americans who live with food allergies as well as their caregivers aren’t laughing.  There is no “forgetting” about a food allergy in our community for any reason because it can cost a life. We have used Uber Eats for years to feed staff at weekend events, but that’s going to have to stop today.  Do better, Uber Eats.
Horrible commercial. Food allergies is not a joke! It is life threatening! You wouldn’t make fun of any other life threatening condition, this is no different. Very inconsiderate.
Omg people with their shock at the food allergy thing you all should open your eyes and realize Uber is a blood sucking vampire entity
Totally insensitive and not funny about the part with a guy having an allergic reaction to peanuts. A girl died from her allergic reaction to peanuts last month. Totally inappropriate!
Laboured...
1 in 13 kids in the USA now have life threatening food allergies and uber eats takes advertising biggest stage to promote making a joke out of it. On top of that, a young dancer from nyc just died from a peanut allergy this week and DID rememember to read the label.  food allergies are NOT a joke.
Seriously? 33 million Americans have food allergies. Patrick Mahomes' son has a severe peanut allergy. Was that storyline really necessary for your commercial?
🥹
I don’t know how a life threatening disease can be laughed at.  From a parent to a child with anaphylactic allergies to multiple foods and a healthcare provider, have you ever thought what it might be like to “forget” to check a label then ur child has a life threatening or sadly demise  Remove this part from your ad I would expect a company that handles food would be aware and have allergy training
The David scheimmer Jennifer Aniston ad is all I’ll be watching this Super Bowl
It's disappointing to see Uber Eats make light of food allergies in their Super Bowl ad. Food allergies are a serious condition that many people have to navigate every day. Let's promote empathy and understanding, instead of making jokes at the expense of those affected by food allergies.
Not cool, Uber Eats, not cool. Making fun of food allergies is insensitive and inconsiderate. Let's spread awareness and compassion, not humor at the expense of others.
As a parent of a child with multiple food allergies, i find this extremely disrespectful and disgusting. I’ve already deleted this app, and i encourage everyone from the FA community to the same. You guys are a FOOD delivery app, mocking people with food allergies, shame on you!
So much of this was funny, until you watch the peanut butter part--which is not even funny, uber eats are you aware that a 20 year old just died after a bite of mislabeled food less than a month ago? do you want to inspire distrust in your own food allergen practices? as the parent of 2 kids with DEADLY food allergies, and a pediatric doctor, this was WRONG. glad to know you have no trouble poking fun at a REAL and growing medical condition, that's 1/13 kids, 2 kids in each classroom, and 33 million Americans who live w this. This type of mockery inspires bullying and not taking seriously a life threatening condition, please remove that segment. it wasn't even funny.
What exactly is funny about food allergies??  Totally insensitive and ignorant of you Uber Eats!!  Shame on you!!
My daughter has a life threatening peanut allergy. That was not funny at all. Who OK'd this?
This could have been amazing but what a disappointment. Life threatening medical conditions are never a joke. Perpetuating misinformation promotes bullying of millions of Americans with food allergies. Remove the peanut allergy bit, the rest is great.
Uber Eats, this is NOT okay! Food Allergies aren't a joke. This "joke" would be like an Uber/Uber Eats driver forgetting how to drive and crashed. You need to do better. I work in video production, and the fact that I know that this took rounds of scripting and creative approvals, casting, and even makeup artists on set curating the hives, swollen lips, and swollen eye - and it still got approved is absolutely appalling, shocking, embarrassing and just shameful! I have many life threatening food allergies. Is my life and experience a "joke"?My Dad had life threatening food allergies, and died because of this "joke" that you think is so funny. Is his life a joke? DO BETTER!
Why is Uber making light of peanut allergies? That’s a deadly anaphylactic allergy that’s increasingly afflicting young children. Legit no different than throwing in a joke about people with cancer. Seriously, wtf were they thinking? Sell your Uber stock; they obviously have idiots running the company.
Food allergies aren't a joke!! It's stuff like this that leads people to not take my wife and I seriously when we tell them about our son's peanut allergy. "A little benadryl" isn't going to help.  Would you be okay with your uber eats app forgetting to deliver the correct order to someone with food allergies??
Food allergies are no joke. You don’t “forget” you have a life threatening allergy.  There are so many other things you could’ve done to add to the “funny factor”   Poor taste, Uber Eats.
I thought this ad was quite clever ... until Uber Eats made fun of life-threatening food allergies.  My son is allergic to eggs, milk and seafood and has suffered anaphylaxis several times due to errors made at restaurants.  I assure Uber Eats that food allergies are no laughing matter.  Obviously food allergy families are not their target because we typically don't have the luxury of using their service, but please still remove the peanut allergy segment and consider issuing an apology to the people you offended with a life-threatening disability.
Making fun of food allergies is dangerous. It ruined an otherwise funny ad. Do better!
uber must have lost more money making this ad 😂
It's disgusting that you are mocking a food allergy in this commercial! Try having a loved one with a food allergy, then tell me you would find this funny. Do better!
The things that are no where near important to me I don’t think about it
A lot of people don’t think about things like that to be honest, it’s not so important enough to be thinking about it
Disappointed to see a food allergy joke in here.
Mind your own business
My 18 year old daughter died of food allergy anaphylaxis last year.  It is disgusting that Uber Eats would make fun of food allergy allergic reaction.
How would you rate the video out of 10?😢
Ok, this one was the best of all of them.
Don’t forget $3 for 9 miles
Making fun of a life threatening medical condition is a complete moral failure. Ruined the ad.
0:08 Ayo that's my boy Keith Leak Jr from Smosh Pit. Hi, Keith! Love you ❤
Truth: It’s super easy for allergy families to forget @UberEats. We don’t have the luxury of easily ordering food from apps. As a mom of two kids with nut allergies and a marketing background, who thought it was smart to make fun of a food disease when your literal “bread and butter” is food delivery? Seriously. This ad didn’t need it. There was no value. Remove it and let Jen and David steal the spotlight a few seconds longer. Seriously. A young girl just died because of a mis-labeled peanut ingredient and our community is furious.
Nikad veću glupost nisam video. 😂😂😂
$146.76 Billion Market Cap as of February 24’ Uber is the 88th wealthiest company in the world. It’s offering a service to people but unfortunately the drivers are treated very poorly. Its overseas driver support is extremely poor when something goes awry, the pay (before taxes btw) is below poverty level and the customers are sometimes disrespectful and entitled. Uber’s endgame is to eventually have a fleet of robotic taxis, drones or robots to deliver your food and take you where you want to go. Drivers know they are living on borrowed time but would it be too much to pay them more and possibly offer better support?
Love it
Oooff..  Nothing against the concept of the commercial, but making fun of food allergies is pretty tasteless.  As a human who understands making fun of any other human with conditions that they have to live with which is out of their control and as a parent of a child with life threatening food allergy, that was an insensitive and low blow Uber Eats...wow.  I'm not sure how that one joke made it through quality control or HR for that matter as I'm sure you have employees who have food allegies since they are so common.  And only a week or so a young 25 year old girl with her life ahead of her just died from eating mislabeled cookies.  Shame on you.
This is an advertisement for plastic surgery
Better make room in the trophy case for a Clio award
I don't think making light of food allergies is funny at all.
Eheree my coupon
Making fun of life threatening food allergies is not comical. You wouldn't make fun of other life threatening medical conditions, why do it for food allergies? It's 2024. Do better. How disappointing.
That's not Ross and Rachel, it's just David and Jen 😏  I'm disappointed!
Im tired of uber eats people picking at my dam food
@Ubereats  so many celebrities 👍
There is no humor about having a life-threatening food allergy to peanuts. Very irresponsible and very inappropriate.
Food allergies are life-threatening for many people. Joking about peanut butter, when peanuts are one of the most common food allergies, disrespects those who suffer and it discredits the allergy community who has spent so much time trying to educate others. Do better @ubereats! Please pull this advertisement.
KEITH!!!!!
Making light and fun of a peanut allergy is NOT ACCEPTABLE!
Disappointed that Uber Eats used food allergies as a punchline in their Super Bowl ad. It's insensitive and teaches the wrong lessons. They should raise awareness and educate instead of making jokes about a serious health issue. The entertainment industry should promote understanding, not humor at the expense of those with food allergies.
As someone who deals with food allergies, I find it incredibly disappointing and insensitive that Uber Eats would use a life-threatening condition as a punchline in their Super Bowl commercial.

So life-threatening allergies are funny? To whom? Shame on you, Uber Eats.
Indianapolis market making $6/hr this is a joke This should be criminal .
Very poor taste to mock a medical condition, especially a life threating one like food allergies.
Could have left out the peanut allergy joke. Food allergies are not a joke for so many children (and adults). It's a disease and people die from it. Really disappointed they put that in the commerical, totally unnecessary and insulting to those of us who have or care for people who have food allergies.
The peanut allergy part of this ad is so unnecessary, and hurtful to the 33 million Americans with life-threatening food allergies.
Funny except for the allergy bit. Unfortunately someone just died from a peanut allergy. Cut that part and the rest is funny!
How pathetic to joke about food allergy’s.
Instead of burning millions in this bs, they should have invested all that money in making the service better for their clients.
Not cool to joke about food allergies
Am i the one one that thinks it would have made it 10x more hilarious if shes said "like i could forget we were on a break" instead of like id forget 10 years of my life
There is absolutely NOTHING funny about severe food allergies.
It’s lame that they had to make a joke about food allergies.
The peanut bit was a little insensitive. Just leave food allergies out of stuff like this. It's not funny.
It was funny until the peanut allergy part. Yikes.
Schwimmer is a legend
I love seen Schwimmer and Jen together!!😍😍
Missed opportunity for David to accuse Jennifer of eating his sandwich.
Schwimmmerr😍 always good to see him
Jen and Davidd❤❤❤
VERY disappointed UBER, using a life-threatening food allergy as a joke. This did not need to be included in the commercial to make a point. Very insensitive to families of those that have lost their lives to anaphylaxis from a food allergy. We need to support those with this disease. Please do better.
David and Victoria are AMAZING!
Victoria ❤

This is what passes for humor in America... think I'm gonna take a nap during the Super Bowl this year
Clever work, Uber. Still my favorite ride-sharing app.
Why are Uber eats employing asylum seekers none of them speak English
Jen and Victoria both look awful. The amount of work they've had done is ridiculous. Jen used to be a massive crush for me and now her face looks more manlier by the day. THey both used to age gracefully and now it just looks like they are trying to hang out to lookin young by joining the terrible fad of getting work done
Am I the only one who recognized Keith Leek Jr.?
00:29  didn't this guy poison people with Fentanyl?
So sad about the peanut butter allergy, that's not even a joke so so many :(
I really enjoy providing excellent service on behalf of Uber Eats.  Thanks Boss
He should have said “no wonder we were on a break” 😭
Wtf is that ?
OMG IT'S KEITH 0:09
Honestly, I don’t know why Uber does not investigate what is happening with Uber Australia. There’s huge corruption and a cartel inside the customer service department. They are receiving money outside the platform to block accounts for no reason and give preference to specific rides and deliveries. I was harassed by an Indian man face-to-face to not work in his area. After reporting to Uber, they blocked my account and calls. HUGE CARTEL AND CORRUPTION. A lot of people are facing the same problem in Australia
KEITH LEAK JR ?!?!!! 🙌🙌🙌 yaaasss
Who is Mathew Perry? Nobody will ever know..
If only David Schwimmer wasn't a pos genocide supporter, this ad would've been so much better!
Gosh I just love football commercials 😂😂😂❤
Almost funny.

How can anyone recognize either one with all the plastic surgery?! On Friends Reunion, only Joey and Pheobe looked like themselves. Sad they feel they can't age naturally. But enough of the haterade - love this  and Jellyroll's part is hilarious too! ❤

Dave shouldn’t recognize her. She looks like a different person due to all the plastic surgery.
OMG who gives a f about these old 90s washed up actors.
Jennifer didn't bother inviting David to her wedding so she already forgot him long before.
You know what, at least she didn’t eat his Uber Eats sandwich.

Wait... was that Keith from Smosh???
That's exactly how I do them ex's 🍾🥂 now wheres Brad at✨
That's hilarious 😂
They were on a break
Is that KEITH LEAK JR. 😅 Omg so happy for him 👏❤️
Boycott uber eats they help fund a genocide in Palestine
OMG this made me laugh so hard. I love it!
Well, they were on a break for most of it.
Peanut butter. Was that Jerry Seinfeld?
Romans 10:9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
What did she do to her face? Why do female celebs do that to themselves?  That doesn't make them better. She was beautiful as she was.
This is such a Super Bowl ad. All the stars but no money left for a decent writer lol
Loved Jellyroll 😂🤣
How does a video from a small channel that has only 403k views at this time be #1 on trending? Probably buying promotions >:(.
If you want to see how plastic surgery can ruin a beautiful face and make you unrecognizable, look no further than her. 😢
Jennifer Aniston is over-rated. She's so yesterday's news and stuck in the past with her infamous, straggly hair, haircut. Move on Girl and get over yourself. Besides Friends, what has she done with her life? No real marriage. No kids. Just stuck in the past reclusive Jennifer Aniston. Boring. 🥱
Am so going to buy from Uber eats after this commercial that am going to remember 📝
Here for Jennifer&David ❤🤧
Been using UberEats for years. Very grateful of the time it's saved me. Even became an UberOne member. Unfortunately, with the new minimum wage policies my $17 thai food has an $18 service fee. Uber, is there a plan to help alleviate this?  As a hungry citizen, is there something I can do to help? I love the service, but there's no way people can afford that.
Uber eats got plenty of money for celebrity endorsements but can't pay drivers a decent wage 😂😂 well done👏
No wonder our earnings are going down so much! These stars get paid salaries beyond belief
So only the rich can afford Uber eats, dayum those paper bag must be better than Whole Foods
The brain is a most unusual container -- the more you put into it, the more it will hold. (Rex Stout?)
So much plastic surgery on both.
Aw, I love Ross, who could ever forget him! Now what is his real name... 🤔😂
Jennifer and David 💕
Doordash for the win!!! Forget Uber eats :)
Fsck Uber Eats but this is a cut commercial. Love it 🙂
Keith Leak Jr!!!
Remember uber eats and forget Doordash?
omg this is my song dumb dumb!
Lame.
THE JEN AND DAVID ONE HAS RESTORED MY HAPPINES
This is funny lol
"Ahhhhh.. salmon skin rolls."
man, everyone got old...
They missed the opportunity for David to go on a rampage  after his uber eats delivery driver once he discovers that his uber eats eats sandwich delivery is missing after being just left on his doorstep. Then he could finally track them down only to discover it's Jennifer.   Though Matt Le Blanc would have been better.  He could have come across Courtney, Lisa and Jennifer on the way however.
Missed opportunity for David to accuse Jennifer of eating his sandwich.
now THIS is a commercial! 😄😄😄
Top tier marketing!
Uber Eats is the new FTX.
Last one ruined it
wow Jenifer Aniston is old. Wonder if she was hot when she was young? She should do a cougar show.
Peanut butter. Was that Jerry Seinfeld?
What did she do to her face? Why do female celebs do that to themselves?  That doesn't make them better. She was beautiful as she was.
Oh no... why did she get work done?  She absolutely doesn't need it.
Fraud company that gives drivers low rates while charging customers high. Uber purposely sends driver high milage orders for dirt cheap .....I hope u guys run out of business
jen and david 💗💗💗
She had work done, doesn't even look like her!
weak
My guy Keith from smosh!
Wait, check close captions at 0:10... Is this for Uber One members only?
Pay your workers a living wage.
I didn't recognize David Schwimmer either.  Even after he took off the sunglasses.
YES MAZIE!!!! I love her music so much this is the coolest
Keith Leak Jr. Booked!
Question? What in the actual Christ happened to Schimmer's face?
I love this.
She didn’t forget. Her memory is just “on a break”
Schwimmer over Beckham anyday
Jelly Roll actually has some talent 🤣
The David scheimmer Jennifer Aniston ad is all I’ll be watching this Super Bowl
david beckem getting fat?
I bet Jessica Aniston remembers when Victoria was a Pepper Lady!
It's always heartwarming when any of the Friends cast reunite ❤❤
This ad could've gotten into some way better hijinx. Too much celeb cameos milking tame jokes too hard. Give us some exciting and dangerous moments with this, Uber Eats cmon don't be boring! This is boring!
Victoria's t-shirt is hilarious. Love her sense of humour 🤣
Jen and David 🥰
Am i the one one that thinks it would have made it 10x more hilarious if shes said "like i could forget we were on a break" instead of like id forget 10 years of my life
Lo unico que puedo pensar es, que le pasa a la cara de Beckam!!!
All I saw is Ross and Rachel
😻😻
Jen😍
keith leak !!
😂😍
