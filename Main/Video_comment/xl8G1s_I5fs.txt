P
All I have for right now  is my word. Promise if u give me the chance to be there in every way for u U will probably ask where I been all ur life. When I give myself I give it all. Just never got the chance to give it physically to u . When I make it home and u still feel same way I promise I won’t disturb ya life again. U are first to make me want really live not survive and settled cause u good to me has man. Promise ya Nau’jour u will never regret it if u do. Take the gamble I promise u won’t lose on it if u do. 💕

Jesus Christ is coming for His people soon brothers and sisters!!! Wake  up and look at all the evil in the world and the biblical prophecies  being fulfilled around us! REPENT of your sins and ACCEPT (confess with  your mouth and believe in your heart) our Lord Jesus Christ as YOUR  SAVIOR and receive salvation and eternal life through Him‼️ He died on  the cross and rose on the 3rd day for OUR sins! Whether you believe or  not judgment comes to all EXCEPT those who put their FAITH in Him.  Through Him we are no longer under condemnation but under GRACE! Dont  wait untill its too late! God bless you all! Amen

listen to me gusta- Anitta ft Cardi B
Who’s here before a million
My brothers and sisters, I love you  And want you to know that this world is full of pain, death, hurt, tears, wickedness, one day this world will be consumed by the wrath of GOD, I want you guys to know that it is not our own good works that get us into heaven, the bible says in Isaiah that our good works are filthy in the eyes of GOD, the bible says a lot of people will enter hell, but there is a WAY OUT , GOD sent his son who lived a perfect, sinless life, and taught us the way in which we should live, he sacrificed himself on the cross and gave his life for all humanity, that in HIS righteousness WE can become saved, NOT because of our deeds, but because he paid the price for our sins, the reason why JESUS CHRIST can pay the price for all humanity is because he is GOD ALMIGHTY manifested in human form (1Timothy 3:16)(John 1:1-14), GOD is a spirit. The bible says in Nahum that the clouds are the DUST OF HIS FEET!!!! and this immortal from everlasting to everlasting GOD, who is invisible wrapped himself in flesh and bones and become  the man CHRIST JESUS, and through our faith in him and trusting in HIM ALONE we are reconciled to our Creator, JESUS CHRIST is the only way in this life, and the life to come, I pray that whoever reads this gets transformed and touched by the HOLY GHOST, you are never too far from JESUS call out to him and I promise you, he will hear you and show you his grace and unfailing love, his mercy is limitless, forsake your ways and turn to the king of kings lord of LORDS, prince of peace, JESUS, choose today who you will serve, yourself and end up in hell, or JESUS CHRIST who grants you eternal life to follow him. I love you guys.

Broke down, and you still want me to feel okay I can't do it, we gotta make some shit work You still try to take my phone and you lurk I have nightmares on the insides You can't fix my heart, girl, you been tried I can't do none of that shit, girl, your friends lied Is it bad that I wish some of your friends died? Yeah, evil And I put that on my soul, girl, I ain't evil I just ride in the demon but I ain't evil Know sometimes I have nightmares and they evil Don't try to tell me you want better Girl, when you know I'm better You could lеave, girl, I'll let you When you lеave, I could bet you I'm the best you ever had and that's for certain Girl, when you leave, just tell me, what was your purpose?  [Verse 1: Toosii] Nightmares on the inside, I think about you sometimes, yeah I got feelings and I'm in love, girl, I won't lie I just wanna be alone, but with you, that don't apply And every time you hurt, girl, you can't say that I ain't try Ayy, evil, evil You Evil Knievel, Knievel You [?] I think you misguided I don't trip when you say you love me, even though I know you lying[Chorus: Toosii] If you know how I feel, why you want for me to feel no way?

[Verse 2: Lil Durk] I was having nightmares on my pillow It's hard to trust, keep a pistol Take Percocets, got me evil I'm controlling my issues Turned your neck and your wrist igloo You the reason I don't like people Plenty times you could've got equal Going on your 'Gram, damn, I miss you I been getting along with my brothers Fuck a bitch, rose up from the gutter I usually don't lie when I stutter 2020 Urus, guts butter All this money turned me evil Gangbanging turned me evil Trenches had turned me evil Voice of the streets, I'm evil[Chorus: Toosii] If you know how I feel, why you want for me to feel no way? Broke down, and you still want me to feel okay I can't do it, we gotta make some shit work You still try to take my phone and you lurk I have nightmares on the insides You can't fix my heart, girl, you been tried I can't do none of that shit, girl, your friends lied Is it bad that I wish some of your friends died?
