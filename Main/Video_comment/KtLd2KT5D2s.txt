Watch the extended cut of the Woodland Mansion raid and caving session with Pearl, Gem, and Cleo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1UfI7PUuw
i feel like impulse wud be such a good girl dad
Rewatching as S10 comes to a close. This I think is one of my favorite large but cozy starter bases.
38:36 i'm gonna throw up, why hasn't i ever seen that in a hermitcraft out of context, that's a real dissapointment
Watching through everyones hermitcraft episodes. Very fun to see everyones diff experiences :3
2 years ago   it makes me feel old
Currently playing this and I already explored so many things/places but it's so cool to see it all actually come together and see whats what! Every time I play I'm literally amazed at how much stuff there is and the builds
I've recently gotten into watching Impulse pov, and the way he edited the opening video reminded me of those "family summer montage" tropes in movies. Very wholesome style!
Impulse love him or love him. He can build!
Papi chu chu
to be fair, i am a fan of alanis and never made the iron pick connection
This is my first time watching one of your videos. I have been sampling around to some of the Hermitcrafters that I haven't watched yet. I have enjoyed your video. You have a great sampling of the first episode. Also one of the criteria that i find important - your have a great voice, pleasant to hear.
Best first episode ever !lol  amazing !
I binged gems and then needed more from you binged both your sky blocks and then decided I needed to see your hermit craft too, and when I’m needing more I found FWIP. You all truly make my work day better😂
This episode was a blend of you being a chaos starter, and a toddler parent to Gem every time she had a mob
9:23 Oh behind you gem UGHÆÆÆ
RIP TFC o7
I can’t believe impulse went my name with the only girls on the server for the first episode. Just one guy and three girls casually mining
Omg who doesn't know the song Ironic??!
RIP TFC - you will be missed ...
I just started watching you and I love it!
15:38 gem is so relatable 😂❤
all videos have a lot of views, what are your tips?  Good idea, nice videoan❤
Never knew Impulse had a lisp. I watch Grians channel and when he comes on I don't hear it, but i guess his mic picks it up more when recording. Nothing wrong with it, but I've just never noticed it and I've watched them since season 5 or 6.
Just came across your channel, Might as well start one Episode one of Season 9! I love the start! You and the girls laughing at the beginning was wholesome. Made me stick around! I know i'm a year late but keep the content rolling! Now time to binge watch!
fortune 4 ?
Me and my friends could never, there would be a war after a week
Impulse you are hiding you things the same way everyone did on Double Life! lol
I will show you the world as well..
All those deaths..chat was probably like what the heck are they doing!?
I should of counted how many times you died…
I have been watching your Phasmo streams! In them you are the calm smart one. In this mansion you are the opposite! You yell the name of every bad guy in shock like it will make them less of a threat! So funny!
32:10 a hermit behind impulse is creative flying
Never thought I'd be back here 7 years later watching an absolute blast to the past. I absolutely forgot about you guys as life took priority, but existed for the nostalgia bomb
11 months late but meh. Binge watched geminitays, and now at the end of her playlist till next upload so decided to come bingewatch another of the soupgroup. Its going great seeing from another perspective though forgot about the mansion im beginning
Bro that is your starter base????? My end game base is less decorated then that
Rewatching all hermitcraft 9 in Jan 2023 lets go time to catch up
it would be so fun playing Minecraft with Impulse. never a dull moment
2:19 I never knew this was how the soup group was formed
Third time through, WOOOOOT
Ive seen at least 10 other hermits' pov of the first episode and the part where ren says "I just like to say this is a terrible idea" still cracks me up
Just realised you can see bdubs building the monolith in the background of this timelapse lol
Spawners ignore the new lighting rules from what I can tell. They still spawn at 7-8 and below. Another interesting note is they won't spawn more entities if there is enemy mobs (from the same spawner I think) in its spawn-box 9x5x9
Impulse you're so wholesome!! Happy new subscriber here :D
bro i was cringing when impulse made another diamind pic rather than denchant his other one or use his iron one
i can tell impulse was kinda annoyed when gem mined one of the diamonds
rip tfc :(
Bros got his own harem, out here pulling all the girls.
Coolest start to s9 that I've seen so far!
So I just searched to find which episode this was... First time I watched this I thought I was too young like Gem till these last 2 weeks. I've been listening to the i heart 90s station and realized I knew the song the whole time. Now I laugh every time I hear it and think of this moment. Thanks Impulse for that
I literally never got the "Isn't it Ironpick" joke until now. I've played minecraft for 8 years.
The first part kind of reminded me of the end of Halo 2 and the start of Halo 3 when chief was falling from the sky and Johnson found him on the ground. Brought back some good memories.
God I wish I had a group of friends like this to play minecraft with. My friends barely ever get on and when they do they just mess around and troll me instead of playing the game, or complain that there's nothing to do...
SO MANY HERMITS NOW 🥰 I can't wait to see the adventures you all get into. Any season with the Hermits is a good one!
Im JUST starting the series and I got chills thinking about your intro! I can't wait to dive and binge into season 9!
2:12 and 2:20 this is how Soup Group was created  2:24 fWhip is crying Gem
I have been going person to person to watch their journey this season and it's been amazing watching interactions between them and explanation as to why don't things occurred🤣🤣🤣 this is now my fourth person to witness. Poor Gem!!
To many POV’s to watch I have tabs of all the hermits series so far
Gem's video bought me here😂
Impulse and the girls is an incredible squad
@impulseSV I would absolutely love a tutorial/blueprint for this build. It would be really cool to make it into an Inn or tavern type of thing with bedrooms upstairs and a bar/kitchen and seating area downstairs. I'm a big fan of 'The Wandering Inn' book series and have been dying to make the titular Inn in a Minecraft world and this is the perfect style and exactly like what I see in my mind when I read Pirate Aba's books!
GET A DAMN ANVIL
"We could make it an island" some time later *distant nuke sounds*
seams like you and cleo are babysitting gem and pearl.
It's beautiful seeing an American, a Canadian, an Australian, and a British play together in the same group and being obsessed with soup.
I love how Gem acts so noobish sometimes but then doesn't mess around at all when it matters, like protecting you from the nether mobs :D
It's ok Impulse, I know the song too and not alot of my younger friends know it either 😅 Also the mansion raid and chaos in this video is what I needed this morning binge watching Hermitcraft season 9. I just finished Gem's and now watching all of yours. So if you see a few comments from me that's why lol. Love the content as usual!
I'm new to minecraft and only recently discovered hermitcraft the last few months. I am enjoying your content so much!
salmon soop
Hermitcraft starter base = 2 or 3 story house my starter base = villager house sometimes literally sometimes just about the same size
impulse is so nice saving so many people from creepers
Love the build
the way impulse is talking when fighting all tensed and stuff is so funny to me
Impulse and Gem give me chaotic sibling or father daughter vibes and i want to se emore of it XD Its amazing
I feel for you I don't even have an enchanting table
“BEHIND YOU GEM,” “isn’t it iron pick,” and “will stop for coal,” will always be remembered.
Showing my support for you impulse!
4:01 no plan survives contact with the enemy.
this was a great episode.
Meanwhile at this moment grian and mumbo killing scar lol
im 14  and i got the reference at the beginning
I watched all the vids from Gem and now I'm watching it from impulse's pov ;)
💎U
“Look behind you, Gem!” and the Gem tax on the diamonds had me rolling. This has been a great Hermit season. 😂
damn you should do a tutorial on how to build that house
i personaly dont like amethist in builds but jou have don it extremely well it looks gorgeous
im just curious why does he say efficiency 5 when its efficiency 4 and fortune 4 when u can only get fort 3
i ship gem and inpulse 😌😎
Maybe Gem and Perl didn't know the song cause it's very irontic... BEHIND YOU GEM
like how the hermits rlly be casually building master pieces as their STARTER bases
10:19
Im watching 4 hermits at once now grian, mumbo, scar, and you! (Ocasionally iscall
I can't imagine anyone complaining the videos are too long.  Doc puts ones out an hour long.
"Go big or go home" umm that's the thing you have none
''behind you gem'' should be on a t-shirt xD
This trio gives off the older cousins of the family going off to cause chaos vibes and I love it
MAKE A ROOM THAT HAS A INF RAIL ROAD RUNNING AROUND THE ROOM SO BOTH SPAWNERS WORK
Brothers of the mine rejoice!
love how impulse conveniently doesn’t include the bit where he forgot to get moss from the lush cave 😈
Wait what does pearl do at 7:27 ?
Good to see scars death montage apart of this.
oh my god im so glad that iron pick achievement IS referencing what i thought it was, i always sing it in my head when i get it
Coming back on this, when he does the Timelapse, you can see both Pearl and Bdubs building their bases at the same time.
Impulse is the DDDestoyed of Hermitraft
I am now watching 4 season 9's
On the corners how about using stairs for a corner seat to hide the lecterns
Did no one record the amount of times Impulse died in that mansion ?! I was cackling
these guys really need some pvp practice
31:10 "First try!" 😂
Afk water pool could help load in Both spawners. Ik I'm a bit behind on the series
"Where's my yardsale?" is such a good thing to say about your death place items XD
25:38 fortune 4??!!
You know it’s a starter base when you make the exterior in one sitting
Came here after watching Pearl's episodes, looking forward to watching the rest of these, and now also looking forward to Gem's
One of the funniest episodes I've seen in a long time. Behind you Gem! Laughed till I coughed - I'm in bed with covid and this little gang really cheered me up.
9:21  BeHiNd YoU gEm
You should make the zombie spawner feed to the same spot; that way you will be able to get it full while standing in a larger fraction of the base. It's amazing that cobblestone goes so well with amethyst! You should put an acacia trapdoor over the drop-down into the base and put a sign by it which says "Gem is grate". Impulse, you sound SO much like Scar, has anyone told you that?
The lecterns DO look awesome as rails! I never thought of that before. What I think I would do about the corner is take out all the lecterns that are on the edge/corner and replace them with a solid log, while keeping all the other lecterns as is. And the trap doors can be used everywhere except in the corners, both on the inside and outside. I think that could look good.
I love how Impulse is technical and an amazing builder :)
How do some of these people not know one of the most popular songs of the 90's? lol
or a stair
use a full block to block both sides
this was such a funny first episode to the new season, cant wait to see what you guys get up to
Who was that in the background teleporting? ...
"blind seed" my ass.
If you have a pick axe with Efficiency IV and Unbreaking III. It will make one pick axe with Efficiency V, Fortune III, Unbreaking III. ^_^ However, the level requirement might be expensive or it will say to expensive. D: Game of chance with enchanting.
Fortune 4?
Yeah.. started in a basalt delta, and after tunneling over 5000 blocks in the nether (honestly may have to add a 0 there...) I STILL have not seen most of the stuff down there... I still have not seen warped forest, crimson forest, fortress, bastion, or ruined portal... No matter which direction I go, it is just basalt, soul sand, or wastes with NOTHING in them:D  For the surface I have only seen plains, jungle, desert, ocean, and snowy mountains, with a couple villages along the way. Never seen a mob spawner period... I think I have some interesting luck in minecraft:D
31:33 Put another item in the Aha chest Impulse.
impulse is acting like a protective dad and I'm all for it!!!
I love how crazy and hilarious the beginning of hermitcraft has been for so many of the hermits.
Composter with a bush on top will cover up the corners on your deck.
Impulse's Isthmus
Impulse being a play boy
Hi. I’m new to the channel, I’ve watched 10 mins so far and I’m already hooked! I subscribed as well. What I want to know though is why and how is your inventory background dark
Late to the party, but at 32:10 ish I saw mr sir teleporting lol...
You and Gem should get people to pay to use the skeleton spawner. Extra diamonds 😁
Lmao, the fact that the staircase was so long he had to cut part of it out of the video🤣
I really like the Bavarian house style.
Grindstones
I would like to thank Xisuma for mentioning whose house this was in his video! I wanted to steal it and couldn't remember who did it! It's beautiful.
you should add some foliage for the corners! something like moss ‘trees’ or something
Big brother Impulse and his three sisters
Impulse = tired mom friend
Hay Impulse Just see scars Video and Tock your Emeralds and Ather Hermits so Tock Them To 👿
please make a weight scale rail to measure the weight of mobs, tell how many blocks are in a minecart with chest. Please do think of the amazing new contraptions that this could bring
We got it Impulse don't worry. Top Dad joke
Impulse a pimp. All the women just flock to him
Idea for the corner thingy -> use a barrel instead of gras and put a carpet / mossy carpet on top of it so you can hide the lecturne with the trapdoor
Fortune 4?
It was so cool to see the timelapse where Impulse built his house while you could see Bdubz doing the same in the background!
use an item frame and map with map art of a wood texture to cover the railing
Everyone there was recording and gem and pearl were recording to
OMG OMG LOL Behind you GEM. What a great time. You did a great job on your house. Love the roof look.
What happened to the two totems of undying?
Was watching with my siblings and we all cheered when Impulse got the fortune enchant!!
Lol it's not that you're unlucky with enchantments, it's that you're lucky when caving. There's that trade-off. Apparently you can't have both
what is the thing impulse is holding at 31:21 ?
You'll be surprised when I say.. I came here to see the build 😂
they are using him for killing crepers
U would love if we got fortune 4
30:35 Efficiency *"5"* , not bad :?
Best start to a hermitcraft season I’ve seen. Just so chaotic and funny compared to the usual start to everyone’s series every time.
worst alanus morisette ever
I just realised you look so mad when you have a helmet on lol
Oh how the story has grown over seasons like there wasn't much story till end of season six and then more story happened more often
Hi Impulse just wanted to know if you could maby tell me what the seed is of the Hermitcraft Season 9 world
he is getting all the girls
Morisette would be devastated
Farm idea. Since both spawners are fairly close together, not close enough, set up small minecart system to loop around to have both active with the cart going past the drop points for each.  This way you can do a ride-by harvesting of both for faster xp.
Man I would love to know what seed this is and what the world type settings were. Such an amazing seed.
I’m late watching this one but I just want you to know that I like the 40 minute videos
Lol!  I keep wondering if you're a Canadian?  That song Alanis Morissette once sung.   I loved your Second video first...then Subscribed to you and GeminiTay as well.  A great first start to ALL of you (I was already Subscribed to Bdoubelo100)!!
I wish there was an easy way to change audio to mono in YouTube on mobile. I'm used to watching videos with one earbud in, and with Minecraft's voice chat these days everyone on Hermitcraft fades out when Hermits are moving around so I miss half what other players say. Minor inconvenience, but funny how an objective improvement like spacial chat can be a negative in some situations.
25:38 I’d love to get fortune four
The first skeletons died when they landed because they accidentally shot each other in crossfire when they were shooting at you while you were removing torches.  😘
Amethyst blocks being kinda crazy for a starter build? Impulse, after we saw Scar's base last season, NOTHING is too crazy for a starter build.
To hide that one corner on the balcony maybe you could use a brown banner?
Everyone: *Crashes down onto a new planet after witnessing a gigantic Moon destroy their old planet* Also Everyone: HELLO HELLO HELLO HEELO *100 times*
"Oh my God this  is the worst!" Me: "Wait is that a fortress? I haven't seen one in ages. Like, 4-5 2000 block journeys."
Gem: Making MineCraft Look Great Again.
I found you because of  Mumbo jumbo don't tell him🤣 subbed and liked . Awesome content!!!!!
really liked the video thanks
How to impress a girls in Minecraft  Jump off a cliff and die
are impulse and gem dating
Depsite them fighting pretty much the whole time they never mentioned critting every hit nor did they do it, however this time I don't mind. They kinda set the vibe I'm just entertained
Did anyone else realize he said he wanted fortune 4 on his pickaxe
32:15 Did pearl jus go flying by?
Pearl: I will show you the world~splish~ wee  Impulse: I will show you the world as well /squish/ dead  😂😂😂
“Alright efficiency 5”…… it was efficiency 4
Looks like impulse is living a harem
Gem's laugh is so contagious
How to you make that of a long bubble elevator with out drowning? If you kelp all the way.
Is that someone in creative at 32:16 or is that a camera account?
Only Impulse could get a raid party with only the best female Hermits on day one
Perhaps a flower pot in the corner? It looks great!
Oooooooh “Behind you Gem!!!!”  Gem left all of that yelling out of her video and I was confused about the sword but this makes sense now! 🤣
I love how Impulse is just designated dad friend 😂 So excited for the new season!
GEMMINI BEHIND YOU - impulse
36:39 Why not have a block bump out in the corner there to cover it up?
he be startin out wit da ladies
How many people went and searched up isn’t it iron pick after impulse sang the song LOl 😂
34:55
36:51 maybe add a stair there
We need a Behind you Gem counter
literally impulse dying on purpose for content
Am I the only one who didn’t know bout season 8
i feel like impulse is a tired dad this whole episode
I love your starterbase  <3
OMG USE GRINDSTONE AHHHHHH
Fortune 4?
does anyone know the seed?
Good job love tou
How fun would it be if ppl fell in though? haha
Dude your base/house is epic and I would be honored to have you build me a base all of my bases look like beginner noob bases and always comes out looking horrible
Did no one else see how impulse got all the ladys
Omg lol lol lol "Behind you Gem"!!!! Impulse is Gem's Guardian Angel! 💕
What mod do u use for the broken tools @inpulseSV
Gem needs rearview mirrors
I know the song. I'm glad those kids are unaware of that butchering of the English language.
I've heard adding powdered snow to a skeleton farm can turn it into a Stray farm, and they have better drops.
Oh my gosh I'm so glad I checked out your channel! Such a fun opening, and I love your interactions with the others!
what is the seed
Impulse do be getting the hoes tho.
36:54 stairs?
Impulse is rolling with the hunnies
best method ive found for finding geodes is diving in the ocean
Happy birthday impulse!!!🎉
Behind you gem
32:14 Pearl showing the world what aussie internet is like...
Really cool intro
I loved your introduction better than anyone else's!!!!  It was like waking up from a nightmare!!!  Well done!!! ❤❤👍👍
It actually isn't ironpick
i dunno why but i think its kinda cute how in the first minutes impulse was basically the womanizer. It simply fits him somehow.
I love how everyone was interacting while grian was breaking the stone block xD.
GEM BEHIND YOU
All these videos from all the hermits is giving me such a will to play Minecraft with friends again. Maybe it's the nostalgia kicking in. Looking forward for a good season
why not put a dirt block with a plant in the corner
Gem is Canadian... this is disappointing
You've taken a whole lot of pages out of hermits' books... Pearls door, BDubs' diorite, collecting many hard to get materials for a megabuild like Scar, building a farm before a base like Doc and building no interior like Grian...
Impulse gem and pearl a perfect trio
Just a random idea that might be fun, built a simple little hut and leave a sign inviting everyone to add an addition to it. Rules could be you can build anything you want as long as it’s only one room and it joins with the rest of the house. 🤷‍♂️ Like I said, random! But hey it could end up being a really cool project/content idea...
man impulse and gem and pearl is the best combo ever i hope they continue to do colabs all season
The man said fortune 4
the best was when they all stared at him blankly after he was done singing
I am so glad Hermitcraft is back. I follow you, Mumbo, and Gemini pretty much exclusively.
Replace the walls with tinted glass
I hope to see more collab with gem. yall are a treat
Always love ur vids, Impulse!  And the flashback to last season?  Well played.  One question though.  Where’s Etho?  He introduced me to EVERY ONE of the hermits and I’m a little sad despite all ur awesomeness!
Gem, a Canadian, not knowing the song Ironic by Alanis Morissette... 😂
I feel like your [ starter base ] is your mega base
Impulse haging out with the girls was actually chaotic funny
I'm super excited for this season. I'm definitely excited to see the extended director's cut - bedtime now but I may start it after getting ready for bed until I fall asleep. Thanks as always for an amazing episode - you are one of my comfort streamers/youtubers and I can tell you had a bunch of fun so I'm excited to go along this journey with you and everyone once again!
Yep! That’s why you make the big bucks! A house that takes normal people a month to build, you knock out in a few hours… with twice the detail. Legendary starter base!
🤣 This episode should of just been called 'BEHIND YOU GEM!!'
The motto of season 9, “behind you Gem!”
man, there is just amazing energy in your interactions with gem. I definitely want to see more of that, and I'm glad she is going to be closer to you and pearl this season…
Every time i watch  a hermit build or look at a hermits build a little bit of me dies! (im a builder but not that advanced) I love your builds hermits!!!
Love you, Impulse!!!! I'm really happy that the new HermitCraft season is out!!!!!!
All the guys went one way. The girls went one way… and impulse
Someone was flying in creative mode right in front of you when you were talking about needing to find a geode... Do people use creative on the server??
31:40 - I like your positivity😊👍🏻
:)
I feel like Gem and Impulse have the older brother, younger sister bond, the way Impulse I have come to annoy, I love it 😃
10:10 - 😄
Gem and impulse or the duo I never knew I wanted but always needed
The mall mansion
Make the mansion shopping district
You and Gem together, loved it 😂
Love the outro music
Omg. I... didn't know I didn't catch the "Isn't it iron pick" until now. And I love that song. Will now forever sing it.
Put a barrel in the corner to block the lecturns on both sides of your porch
Really wish I could have watched this when it was uploaded. Partly because...  Always follow the other ores to find diamonds. This updates trick: find exact center between two different kinds of ore. Dig straight down (2x2 hole) till find deepslate. Start using poke holes on all sides every three blocks down after that.  Has worked every time.  (The edit is fixing dumb auto correct)
so glad hermitcraft is back ; thank u impulse and happy birthday ♡⡱
impulse, i copied your roof. SO MUCH AMETHYST >w<
Dadpulse and the chaos twins! Super excited for season 9 after this start!
Gem: LOOK AT THE BOOKSHELVES! Skellytone: No! Thats Mine!
Was that a Zelda reference I saw?!
the chaotic group i never knew i needed
omg such a cute adventure !
Impulse finally gets a taste of bedrock enchanting
i think that everyone should do a bridge building competition instead of the cobblestone one block track, the bridges district
Pause at 32:16 u can see someone I think it’s perl flying by XD
Impulse and his harem
I love that we practically got 3 timelapses in Impulse's one LOL it's so fun to see other hermits in the background building their own things
To hide the corner of the rail, I'd just put down a block with up-turned stairs on either side, or a trio of stairs, right side up
You two make an awesome duo :D I'm excited to see more from your little comunity with Pearl
You should ask gem if you could Change out the bricks on the spawner tube for tinted glass
oh, in the timelapse it's so cool to also see the buildings around you get build
Not even an hour in and he made himself a harem. That's a new craft right there!
You are the most wholesome minecraft player EVER
For the corner where you can see the lectern try a corner stair to hide it
For the lectern-in-the-corner: Item-frames?
An American, Australian, British and Canadian walk into a woodland mansion.
When you're younger than Gem and Pearl but you know Alanis Morissette
36:53 you can put a composter with a leaf or two on top, make a potted plant. Sure, it’ll be visible on the other side but like, it’s an ornamental potted plant—those are usually visible from across the railing in situations like that
Place Iron Bars in the that corner to make it seem like a deck drain for the rain.
I'm starting to think that impulse is a simp
i actually really like that roof design, and frankly i am just impressed that you found a use for the geode blocks because i still havent.
"We are playing a blind seed this season" Proceeds to find a skeleton spawner directly under starter base
that skeleton spawner... kinda hope that Impulse (or someone) goes back in there and upgrades it to a Stray farm so as to get slowness arrows. Which, imo, would be a good idea and give them a something to sell. Best way to make it is to get 2 powdered snow buckets and 1 or 2 cobwebs. that slows them down enough to be turned into strays and killing strays will get you slowing arrows for little to no effort.
i like it :)
IV is 4 not 5 in roman numerals btw, V is 5 and also the max efficiency level
When the hermits starter bases are better than your main base 😂
Could you use an armour chest to create a fake trapdoor for the corner?
30:36 Five? Pretty sure five is V, not IV which is four.
I’m going to need a tutorial on the starter base. Love it
You could just put a potted plant right there  on an azalea sapling or dirt block on the missing trapdoor area, it would cover it up and look really cute!
9:21 How that creeper never exploded? :O
BehINd yOU geM
At some point in one of these seasons, it would be cool to see a group project between all the hermits where they make an apartment type build and they all live together
9:23 simpulse at his finest
I think a few stairs might be a good way to cover up the lecturns
e
My favourite youtuber
Flowering azalea leaves would look lovely in the corner. :) Pretty foliage.  <3 Thank you for this!
The Hermits need to get together and define the term "starter base."  :-)  Love what you've done with the mansion.  At least it has all four sides from the start, unlike one other Hermit who has a habit of not creating the back until late in the season!  :-D
Just to reassure you, I'm only like a year older than Gem and definitely grew up with that song. So her and Pearl are just uncultured.
I'm jealous about your connection speed
that corner of your balcony with the exposed lectern ... maybe a cauldron sitting there with a tree in it or a bush ... the cauldron would cover up both sides of the interior corner spot
Impulse, for the missing lecturn part u can put a whole block or a fence to cover things up
time for my second 10 minutes dose of impulse
Damn, Day 1 and Impulse already got all 3 girls on the server, what a babe magnet
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
After watching Ep 2 I had to come back just to relive the "BEHIND YOU GEM!!!!" Moments again🤣😂
Zombie spawner in to a copper farm ???
its fine!
Maybe you could use a composter as a flower pot in the corners to fix your trapdoor problem?
Had to subscribe am trying this season to keep up with all the Hermits instead of just one or two that I've watched for years :D
The beginning of this season is so wholesome, then there’s grian and Mumbo killing scar for like five minute straight 😂😂
I didn’t realize that she has songs older than I am.
You could put a curved stair on that corner with the lecturn
"impulse's avatar looks like its wearing eyeliner with the iron helmet outline" is all my mind was focused on in that outo lol
impulse getting on the moves :)
Gem & Impulse is not a duo I knew I needed.
Impulse is going to be second Scar in terms of deaths.
Even though I've seen the first few moments through 10 different eyes I still love watching it!
Did anybody else notice very faint morse code throughout the video??
I do need to ask where is etho?
Why didn’t he take his totems
How he intentionally lands on the block so he dies for content 😂😂
The fact that he put the episode number in three digits, hints OVER 99 episodes in this season (from impulse)!!
A tio for your base. Right now it feels like it does not connect to the ground so you can tray to make it fell connected. One way is to use different types of dirt on the ground
loved their duo.
25:40 Impulse: I would love to get fortune 4...
I still love how even in "space" or the void, mumbo was compelled to walk around as he spoke to not look still
32:42 how did u get ur coords to be two rows in the top left corner? is it a resource/texture pack? /genq
You could fix the corner of the porch by putting 5 stairs in the corner and making a sort of table so you’ve got a cosy place to sit with visitors.
Impulse and the Girls should be a returning special episode where the party goes on crazy adventures with eachother
Ok why is no one talking about the texts that showing up in the intro it says "Wake up impulse" And while he is mining coal when they are mining there's a text in the screen that says "Am I lost"  Idk if it mean something but it looks like it  Also I get it the wake up impulse is tying to the S8 reference thing but what about the  "Am I lost"
Put a composter with two leaf blocks on top as a decorative plant in that corner of the porch to cover up the lecterns
For the lecture corner problem, put down a spruce plank full block, it will cover both sides of the corner😁
22:56 Maybe that one died because another skellie shot em, while they were after you, so it could be already damaged when it fell
im 15 and i got the isn't it ironic reference lmao
There's no such thing as too far impulse. Lol. Use a minecart loop track to afk activate both... You just move yourself in and out of range of each continuously...
For the corner of the patio, I think it would look great to have a couch and a table so other hermits can enjoy sunny days on your patio with some grills or anything? 😉
I would love to see your directors cut!!
Impulse and Gem, great duo!!!
Make a boatem 2.0
Love the optimism adding 2 "0"s before the 1. Looking forward to a long and entertaining season.
am i only one thinkin gem and impulse has something going on
Nice piling
Absolutely brilliant first episode, I love the collaboration and cant wait to see more in the future!!
Can I just say this was the most EXCITING beginning of any of the other episodes I've watched so far??? - AMAZING.... CANNOT wait for the future episodes of this Season!!
Beautiful build. Great to see everyone back for another season. Look forward to lots more
11 min in and I cant stop laughing
wouldn't you be better off with a village trading hall for selling enchants?
what is that...dagger in your first slot?!
got netherwart...didju get any blaze rods?
I love the start of this video best one yet
Gem is as bad as skizz with coal 🤣
that mansion raid was one of my favorite moments of everyone's first episodes!
Word of the day: "BEHiNd yOu GEm!"
Nice outro dude! Love it!
22:55 I'm pretty sure one of those first skeletons died on impact in the kill chamber because when you were in the spawn chamber to knock out the torches, one of them shot another that was between it and you, and so it took damage that it otherwise wouldn't have if there had been no player presence, ie in normal working conditions for the farm.  great to see hermitcraft back again !! I've missed this series so much but I'm glad y'all got a bit of a break :D
The Notorious B.Y.G.
15:52 I love how quickly Gem's head snapped back with glee ahaha
Impulse be getting all the woman
Exploring is fun😂
You are one of my favorite YouTubers! You always put me in a good mood. I know this season is going to. Be the best! You are amazing!
You know its gonna be a big series unlike S8 when the first episode is 001.
You can make a railway system to activate both spawners at the same time but you would have to afk on the rail.
i rember when it took  me hours to get silk touch.
Season 9 hype!
My favorite thing absolutely has to be seeing the other hermits working on their builds in the background of the timelapses! Its so great to see you guys so close together!
Put barrels in the corners to hide the lectures never enough storage and still matches the build
“That’s a big bag of NOPE” -Impulse
Gotta leave behind you Gem signs everywhere.
11:33 *no one:* *Britain:*
Holding out for a hero...and his name is ImpulseSV. ( note the song reference)
Lol Pearl at 32:15 So glad season 9 is here
You and Gem hanging out together is so fun!
For my server just making a loud turkey gobble is our signal that there's a creeper right behind someone.
You can get a person that's really good with armor stand art to cover up the book stand
Under the trap door to the skely farm. So the trap door automatically closes
I love everyone’s take on coming back from season 8 (especially the Boatem crew). Y’all are making it all cinematic and I’m here for it!
Thank you Impulse for the longer episode! Lots of shenanigans and cool stuff! Not to name names (Love Mumbo tho, won't stop watching his content any time soon), feel like a 20 min video can just be choppy. Cheers to HC9!
hey impulse, is there any way that you could upload the vod of you building your starter base on your second channel? i would love to try to build something very similar to that, and a higher frame rate vod would help me a lot!
Impulse why did your voice change so much when you started taking to BDubs😂
Saw your house in Scar's video. Had to check it out.
I love the build Impulse it's so Pretty!✋ 8:40 after the song the silence was so Loud...... 9:06 I will show u the world As Well!-  And ofc how can we forgot... BEHIND YOU GEM!! -ImpulseSV 2022
If I could give 3 thumbs up, I would, only because Impulse sang. 😂😂😂
What a great start.... no etho??!!
2:34 everyone loves spruce
Where’s etho? I didn’t see him in the opening group scene?!
The whole first 15 minutes of the video is literally the most wholesome mine craft content ever
impulse with all the girls
Not impulse spoiling everyone’s starter bases in the timelapse
There in the corner on your porch you can just put a grass block with a flower on it an those trapdoors around it. Idea :)
BEHIND YOU GEM!!!!
who else thinks of Bo Burnham's "Ironic" when getting the iron pick achievement?   I had not considered Alanis Morrissette until just now. lol     This was such a great start to the season, and  I'm so psyched to see what's to come!!
Impuls shall join the australian army as on professionell back-watcher. Or at least he should get an medal from Gem
episode 001 is an exciting concept
i love the fact that element animation got in on this.
Dude, you were going to land in the water fine but you press ‘S’ and back pedal to fall square on the gold ore?
"Behind you Gem!" T-shirts please
"Behind you Gem" "Behind you Gem" Every 5 minutes, I loved this first episode Impulse
I'm so happy more hermicraft is here
At first didn't know what song you were talking about. Then I listened to it and knew 😂
Why do I feel that's there's a little something between Gem and Impulse
25:38 fortune 4???
Where was etho???
Impulse is pretty set if he sticks with the ladies, Gem seems to love making things look cosy and looking after people, While Cleo and pearl are assassins 😁
Make planter on those corners. It will look great. Or make pole lights.
001 go big or go home lmao
Season 9 season of death
Oof.  Pretty sure Gem wasn't even born when Jagged Little Pill came out.  I feel OLD now.
IMPULSE! U can get dubble xp if u transform the farm in a stray farm! Using powderd snow
32:15 on the left someone (I think scar) zooms across the screen
Is he using vanilla tweaks?
Impulse if you have a look at what Wadzee did with his mob farm in his hardcore world the dual mob spawned farm thing might actually work. Hope this helps
Impulse, you should make this into a stray farm
SCP-1 codename GeminiTay Supernatural ability: spawns hostile mobs behind herself  Classification level: Apollyon
I'm an 80's kid and even I had to look up the lyrics for the song. Though I did recall the tune it's self.
isn't it ironic.....lol
Hermitcraft Episode 1: BEHIND YOU GEM!
I think the way to deal with the lecturns at the corners not being able to be hidden behind the trap doors is by putting a full block decoration. My personal recommendation would be a "potted plant" where we use a terracotta base, a fence, and a block of leaves on top.
"First try!" lol
idea: in order to do the corner, replace the trapdoor with corner stairs
Epic start!
Glad to see you are a proud patron of "Confusing Doors by Pearl"
Impulse is an anime main character now
Ren: "Why the hell did you guys listen to me?"
Watch out ... a wild pearl is going to go for impulse's Redstone box.
You can hide the corner lectern with a corner stair?
I missed Hermitcraft so much. Thanks for uploading. Hope to see more from good guy Impulse soon... Hermitcraft server's very own cap'n America 🥰
Finally, im so happy to see that the new season strarted!!
33:35, thought Scar came in for a second
32:16, watch Pearl in the background....she shoots across the screen!!  Spooky!
I love it that you guys just took on a mansion on episode 1. LOL!
In this episode: Gem gives Impulse a heartattack several different times. xD
So glad hermitcraft is back and great episode but everyone forgets the grindstone exists to get rid of enchantments 😭😂 just use it don’t waste your diamonds impulse   Edit: Thankfully he remembered and made one 😂 still don’t know why he made a second pickaxe but at least he remembered the grindstone lol
You will now need to put signs saying "Behind you Gem!" around her entire base this season.
Add some quirky lights and stuff to the tunnels
Impulse having everyone's back, or just gem. I love to see this series on again. I hope you all get to have a lot of fun
Scar Be Like :  Finally A Worthy Opponent..
Just a regular day in the life of impulse  Surrounded by women
you can disenchant items if you don't get the right enchantment
Drop a few glow stone in the walls of the elevator. Great to see you all back
Impulse having everyone's back, or just gem. I love to see this series on again. I hope you all get to have a lot of fun
Ooo that house is a big boi! :D Agreeing with the others on the composter - flowerpot idea on that corner  Also, impulse, even if your episodes are an hour long, we would be happy as heck!  Good luck and happy times on the new season~
super stoked for the long cuts! I love playing all the HC videos in the background as I work so no complaints for longer versions here :)
impulse for the book to change you have to put it through and then remove the enchantment
iron pick song?
This was great! It's gonna be my first hermitcraft season to watch ever so looking forward to the rest ^^
36:52 maybe a cute little table + seats? Seems fitting for a porch to have some seating areas :D
Your base looks so cool!
For the corner bit, maybe extend the roof a bit and put a support beam there, I think that could work well.  Or maybe switch out the trapdoors for stairs but ehhh idk
gotta give it 2 ya was kinda scepticle about the amythest, but u made it look aswesome!
You should add some glow lichen to your roof, it makes the transition from amethyst to ruff just a little smoother :)
Love the house Impulse. Can't wait to see what you come up with next.
You always live up to your name impulse lol 😍😍😍 love watching your videos and you have great neighbors ! You and Gem are a cool duo the way she asked you to create the spawner was hilarious 🤣 I enjoyed this entire episode 💖
You can put a log in the corner, maybe decorate with a lantern or flower pot
gem has the most ever luck iv'e seen!
Hi ImpulseSV.
36:02 "We seed to go exploring because EXPLIRING IS FUN‼"
Music at 8:25: ?v=xe19kpoJQ-U
I cant believe you built something so massive so quickly- amazing! The roof is beautiful with the amethyst! Wow!
Impulse has my favorite timelapse music of all the hermits.
In the corner part where the trapdoor's a bit dumb, you could put a cauldron with something on top.. maybe leaves or something :)
Inpulse being the ALPA MEN.!!!
No etho?
Impulse is the ladies man in season 9! Way to go buddy!
36:50 could put down a composter with leaves on top for a potted plant to hide the lecterns!
Gem impulse duo is so funny lol. Pearl gem and impulse group is amazing together
The base looks awesome!
I can already tell this will be a great group!
Impulse, I know you won’t see this comment, but I just want to say thank you. I watched your hermitcraft videos as soon as they came out during quarantine, and you helped me deal with isolation, as well as create some of my fondest memories from that time. I vividly remember watching your videos as I did at-home workouts to stay in shape. Your videos not only entertained me, but also got me back into minecraft and connected me with new friends that I’m still close to today. Thank you for your continued consistency and great content 💚
The elevator can actually go down a block to hide the hopper and they will be one punch instead of 2. The first skelly that died was because it was punched already when it spawned.
Great starter base, you and everyone are outdoing themselves!
0:97  U didn’t all make it… Where is Etho?!?
Maybe for the corner of the porch, just put a cauldron, fence, and leaf for impromptu plant?
It's ok impulse, I like Alanis morisette. Though the most ironic thing about the song is everything she list are not examples of irony.
ITS LIKE RAAAAAAAIIIIN ON YOUR WEDDING DAY can't believe Pearl and Gem don't know Ironic. We're old...
this guy is swimming in women
How many hermits forget about the new mob spawning light levels?
Omg she doesn't know Alanis Morissette? Gemini needs to hand in her Canadian card! /jk
you're always building in the water underground or on land. have you thought of building a base in the sky?
The second I saw scars post my heart basically stopped this is a big deal
It’s like rain on your crafting day…
the new outro lmao
“Behind you Gem!”
I had hoped that pooka was going to be editing the hermitcraft videos since he's done such an amazing job with the hardcore episodes.
Ladies Man
So happy you are all back for season 9 finally.  I can't wait to see how the builds progress.
That back porch area is my faavorite. Can you place most other things in the area where the trap doors can't be next to eachother? I honestly can't remember offhand. Barrel? Smol[ish] tree decoration that hangs leaves/vines over the edge?
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Maybe do three stairs in the porch corner, so the middle one wraps around
"Behind you Gem!" Quote of the season.
The Antichrist take over is getting closer. Then the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to grab the church (his saints) then the Great tribulation at the end of the Bible in Revelation (the apocalypse if you will) begins. The Lord Jesus Christ is coming back SOON, repent now while there is still time. Confess your sins love the Lord God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and great commandment. Love your neighbour as yourself spread the gospel that Jesus is the only way to heaven.
Somehow impulse ends up with every girl on the server except bdubs in the first 5 minutes
That was the sexiest intro snap.
I would've totally removed the water at the bottom you are too kind impulse
The circles on the resource packs was so trippy for me
Following you on stream since the end of season 8, I've really been looking forward to see you go, and man, did you go! This episode was so wholesome, and I'm really looking forward to the rest of this season! 😍
Can we pls get a tutorial for your new chicken cooker design?!? ;)
It's all fun and games until someone throws and anvil down that hole, after you. :P
Is HC on pause?
So hyped for Season 9. House looks amazing.
bloodbath at the very beginning 💪🕶️🤣
Riverside shops, accessible only from boats on the water....I'd love to see this!
For that exposed lectern corner, may I suggest a plant? Maybe just a composter as the bottom pot and a few azalea bushes on top.
Impulse with the girls is a group I didn't expect to love so much. Honestly the chemistry is great. And super funny. Prolly my favorite interactions so far.
A galant and brave warrior taking down the woodland mansion. 👍
For the corners of the porch you could put a cauldron there with leaves to make a nice planter
You know Gem is a real Aussie when she deals with nasty mobs that come without even blinking
“It’s like Raaaaaaaiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaannnnn on your wedding day! Its a free rideeee when you already paid! It’s some good advice that you just didn’t take!!!”.      I got you Impulse. I got you. 😉 😆
did you guys ever figure out what happened that made it so big?  Edit: I just realized there is 25 hermits
… does bdubs have on true religion pants lol
Composter in the corner on the deck 👍
22:15 I was wondering why the deepslate had an arrow on it... then I realized it was a hopper lol
I don't know what it says about me that I'm the same age as Gem, but I not only caught the Alanis Morrisette song, I also have it memorized 😂.
7 hours?!?! and we only got 40mins?!?! :(
Impulse, you NEED to make the amethyst farm into a science lab and have those in water tanks and a conduit nearby.
Where’s etho
Tell Gem she is kicked out of the Canadian club for not knowing about Alanis Morissette. Isn't it ironic.
Impuse a simp!
So many people
🎶It's like RAAAIIIIIINNNN on your wedding day it's a FREEEEE RIIIIDE when you've already paid 🎶
SimpulseSV
Scar Episode 1: Dies multiple times and gets bullied.   ImpulseSV Episode 1: Takes all the girls on an adventure and gains a bunch of loot.   Lesson: Hang out with Impulse
38:08 i wonder whos base is that on the island
Impulse being like "Charlie," and GeminiTay, ZombieCleo, and PearlescentMoon as the "Angels."
good to see you stress😍😍 , I'm so stressed without seeing you last season 🥺🥺😢
That house is EPIC my dude! Love the roof and use of Amethyst! Also, love when you and Gem get together it is always a great time!
Impulse and Gem is a dynamic duo I didn't realize I needed. Add on Pearl, and you got the perfect soup gang. Cleo? Even more bonus points! What a fun episode!!!
This was awesome!  So glad to have HC back, but have loved catching you on twitch and can't wait for more content there too!
How does Impulse make his game a bit brighter and more vibrant?
Hey yall 🙂 how yall doing? 💪💯🔥🔥 if anyone wants to do a collab I'm down to I'm not that good but I'm trying 😂 I appreciate yall reading this and hope you have a better day then before reading this much love y'all 💙💪💯🙏🔥🔥
Is etho not going to be on this season? 😔
I'd personally put a sectional couch (staircases) in the corner with a 2 by 2 table maybe some plates and a flower pot to spruce it up a bit more.
Dude your builds getting better and better, soon you cannot call yourself a redstoner-only :P
I love the roof!!
Impluse, they're babies... you're showing your age, as well as mine. .... Oh Cleo. I felt that.
"but this is free I like it" Impulse sounds like a dutchman hahaha
38:14 When I see a video fvrom any Hermit that's over 30 minutes or longer I just KNOW, I'm in for a great time! So, keep up the good work, and I'll be waiting to watch every second of it
I love all the big projects you guys do in Hermitcraft, but the humble beginnings of a new season is always so entertaining to watch. Wish you all extra fun for this season !
32:14 Why is PearlescentMoon floating above the ground?? Are cheats enabled on the server? What's the fun in that?
Hermitcraft: Male and female ratio is already unbalanced Impulse: Takes 3 of them to from a harem Rest of the hermits: Well f***
@impulsesv You could put a plant in some sort of planter in the corner to cover up the backside of both lecterns. 😊
please put a barrel in that corner,
Enjoyed the video. You build amazing farms. Can you hook the other spawner up so you can have bone meal or bone meal blocks in the future or selling items from drops? I don't remember if second spawner was skeleton.  Interested in the new spawn levels how that is going to impact the types of farms you build.
"He didn't get in the boat, GEM!" I am crying
You should renovate the mansion so every hermit has there own room to do whatever they want
Impulse! I watch the stream all the time and there is one thing that stands out a lot between stream and youtube vids.  It's the "YouTube" voice.  Your regular voice just seems so much more real.
IMPULSEEEE THAT ROOOF IS ✨ugley✨
Who doesn’t watch videos all the way through?!?  Love the longer version!
Add one more block to the little raised garden bed to make it an L to sort out that corner
Finally! I found someone who build in the same way I do!; In layers, then you actually have a back :)
I'd love to see  a community villager hall, with a system so everyone can cure each villager for lower trades and no 20+ different villager halls lol.
Turn the skeleton farm into a Stray farm but pushing the skeletons into a Powdered snow and put a cob web 2 blocks below it and you can also get slowness arrows and have fun with the other hermits
Put a bush in the corner to cover the lecterns.
Watching this a second time already.
Can you use your hardcore voice?
When Impulse was protecting Gem from those creepers, I was holding my breath from fear of it exploding on him lol
Always watch till the end of every hermit videos don't wanna miss anything like docs video yesterday with the poppy flowers refilling as he throws them
your videos are so amazing!!!
this was my favorite start ever😂
hey impulse one thing you can do to make the skelleton grinder trp more terrifying is adding a powered snowblock covered with a mos capret at the drop spot and remove the water. The carpet will make it that you don't sink down and the powdered snow nullifys the fall dmg
SUPPORT UKRAINE!!! SUPPORT NO FLY ZONE!!! ASK NATO!!!
You can mine lapis with a stone pickaxe lol
Set a solid block in the corner next to the exposed lectern.
Youse curved stairs to cover the lecterns on the corners of you're starter base. Just a tip 🙂 👍
Tango and pearl both play off impulse very well, it's nice to see that they've shacked up nearby this season.
Dang impulse took all they ladies at once
Where's Etho?
Is this in minecraft 1.19 or 1.18
Day 1: Impulse and his ladies loot a mansion
Good to see you are using the streamer voice as well as YouTuber voice - and the “wake up Impulse” at the start was a fab touch!
Behind u gem behind u gem behind u gem BEHIND U GEM!! Gems gotta go f 5 the behind one
You can put a barrel in the corner to cover up the lectern. Barrels and spruce trap doors have really similar textures and it would also break up the plain flat railing Also, love your time-lapse music
This video should've been titled "Behind you, Gem!"
Impulse: time for a starter base :D  Also Impulse: builds a mega mansion that would take me months
Great first episode Impulse! Can't wait to see what this season has in store for you and all the other Hermits
Lost it with BDub’s scream in the drop. Rewound it a few times just laughing.
36:52  Well one idea is doing some map art of a spruce trap door but that is going to be much later down the road as there would need to be enough of the correct blocks to replicate a spruce trapdoor, the flat space for it, and an empty map which is quite a lot of work to cover up just one thing
This was so funny XD
I love the pearl-gem-impulse alliance, CALL IT “THE MYSTIKS” BTW add a barrel in the Lectern corner
You should use map art to cover the insides of the lecterns
All that Hardcore has made Impulse a juggernaut!!!! Taking down that mansion episode one?! DANG DUDE
I am going to straight-up steal your house. It is gorgeous!
Impulse, your a genius
Man I missed this
Everybody sounds so happy to be there. Glad you guys took a break and are glad to be back together. 😃
Behind you Gem!! haha, cracked me up and Impulse, I absolutely love your build, its gorgeous, all the details and everything! Amazing!!
8:44 I didn't know it was possible for a Minecraft avatar to stare more blankly than normal but here we are!
You can live in the woods lands mansion
Add powdered snow to the skep farm to make strays. Strays drop more loot
if you give the corners of your rails, a reinforced look with whole-blocks, you can solve your trapdoor issue
9:50 impulse gettin some bltches
#16 ON TRENDING
10:16 lol I thought right here impulse was joking because I didn’t see the creeper at first XD
I've watched the mansion segment from every pov now and I still crack up at the shenanigans 😆
Help me get 2k subs I’m literally 5 away! 🥳
Hopefully you can rebuild the chocolate factory and sub to you and me 😀
In the corners i think you should put a wall (or fence) with a lantern on top.
Nice video!
use powdered snow to make the skeletons strays for slowness arrows
this was an absolute blast to watch, i cant wait to see what you all do this season! and i love the lectern banister!
put a potted plant in front of the lectern you can't cover.
Hi, Impulse.  Awesome opening episode.  You could put a composter and bushes in corner to hide the lecturn.
😂😂😂😂😂
The Java version is way OP. They find 2 spawners so close to each other. In my bedrock world, I haven't found one.
Maybe cover the lecterns in the front with Item frames? since they can be put close together with maps.
Haha great start!!
Edit: i have not watched the entire Video before commenting bs    you now about grindstones? they make it possible to reenchatnt the same Pickaxe
I LOVE the back porch of your starter base!
The mansion crew is just: Dad Impulse, Mom Cleo, and Kids Pearl and Gem.  Especially the "I don't wanna be independent anymore" 🤣
Lol I loved in super fast build mode you can see Bdubs in the background building his tower :D
You can put upside down stairs in the corner there and put a flower pot on it with one of those small lush cave trees
I wannna play with u alll sooooo freaking bad ...its my.lifes dream ugh
9:35 I swear you were about to say Nooch!
I love how the starter base looks! Kinda gives a magical tavern vibe, with the amethyst roof and wooden walls. A shop on the ground floor would look perfect in there!
Everyone else:doing normal minecraft things   Impulse every second :BEHIND YOU GEM!!!!!
This is sooo much fun! Please do more extended cuts please.. Great job guys!
*My* *training* the *relax* 😍
You could put a stair on the corners of you’re porch that way it covers the lecterns
Are the viewers allowed to know the seed
You guys really should have done this with armor
Impulse gettin all the girls
idk if this will make you feel better but I'm like 9 or 10 years younger than Gem and Pearl and i got the "isn't it ironic?" reference lol
Alanis Morrissette is showing our age? Let me just Google when it came out.... 1996? '96 songs are aged now? D: We gettin' old yall.
It's good to be back!!
season 8 :- gem is great  season 9 :- behind you gem
Use a barrel in the corner to hide the lectern
IMPULSE WHY DID YOU MAKE 2 PICKAXE YOU COULD GRIND THE OTHER PICKAXE!
Gem is great 😍😍
Remove the corner lecturn and replace it with a log then put a lantern on top I use lecturns all the time and this is my advice
You and pearl's back and forth had me in stitches ♥ you guys hermits for life
I missed you guys and your videos, they always bring a smile to my face
Feels bad.. They didn’t know Alanis Morrisette
So excited to watch another season of your amazing videos! Also for the corners of the balcony maybe put benches or a table or even just pile some barrels if you want to cover up the lecterns
Maybe instead of lecterns, you could use anvils. It won’t be wood, but it’d have a similar shape front and back.
At 32:15 was Pearl flying?
I´m really excited to watch your journey on season 9 :D  It was definitely off to a good start :D Also thanks to Cleo for calling Gem and Pearl "babies" so I´m not feeling super old xD
I laughed so hard at the “Isn’t it Iron pick? Don’t you think?” Lol and Cleo’s, “They’re Babies!” I just can’t! Lol
I love your intro to the season!! It's the most immersive one i've seen so far :)
That was so much fun! Wishing you a wonderful season, Impulse xx
Cheating Vindicators 😅
Gem and impulse and such a wholesome duo... Love it
You said efficiency 5 but it was actually 4. Lol 🤣🤣
use upside down stairs behind the lecterns?
Impulse finding another unintentional glow squid farm at the geode? Lol
Impulse really pulling broads huh
Thank you, looking forward to more great hermitcraft content
36:50 i would put some kind of decoration there - maybe a bench, or some waterlogged staircases for the flower planter on the other side :)
Flashback intro - very nice, very nice.
36:47 maybe make a wee outdoor seating area with a corner seat to hide that transition?
Would be cool to see like a deathcount of day 1
I really love this build. The roof is really inspiring. I wouldn't have thought to blend amethyst and tuff that way and it really works. I might have to borrow some inspiration from that.
YAY! My notifications are full of my favourite hermits and S9! I am so happy 🤗🤗  Edit: best mansion footage I have ever seen! Hahahaa that was either incredibly brave or stupid 😂😂 ANNND your starter house is gorgeous!!
Impulse: "I ant t take things easy on season 9" also Impulse: "Lets raid a mansion on day 1!"
Congratulations impulse on being in the first hermit spot for my viewing this season. Starter bade blew me away. That woodland mansion was insane.
Season 8: GEM IS GREAT! Season 9: BEHIND YOU GEM!
Following all Hermits this season, can"t wait to see what's to come 🔥
I wonder when Hermit Craft will end… I really enjoyed impulse’s Hardcore.
Get rid of the other trapdoor and put literally any full block there. I recommend a sponge.
For the corners on the balcony: move your flower pots or add them to the corners, three moss blocks as the corner with plants. still cant put trap doors on the inside but then you wont see lecterns. so excited for season 9, great start impulse
missing Etho's there
impulse? More like SIMPulse
why don't you guys make a base with different rooms for everyone. Encanto style!
ooh yas, I missed me some HermitCraft.
Wonderful episode. But your starter house made me uninstall Minecraft(kidding obviously).
Is anyone going to talk about Impulse wanting Fortune 4 @ 25:38
Season 9 👍!!!
you dont have to get 30 levels before you check the enchant.  if you check it before you are level 30 you can use the lower levels to mill the enchants untill the level 30 shows a good one, then grind levels to 30
Ohhh yes so excited for the longer version🥰🥰
Cant even tell ya how much I've missed your timelapse. Awesome starter house 👍
Where's Etho
impulse is so bro/dad/uncle here in a very fun way
I'm so happy Hermitcraft and all the shenanigans are back! I am loving your starter house, especially the combo of the calcite with the wood. And the patio at the back is just so nice too. I feel like leaves and/or amethyst crystals on the roof could further enhance the look!
Everytime i see you all die at the beginning i just have to think how i manage to do it without deaths everytime i start playing on a new world
Episode one of a new season always makes me want to hop on a new world
I like the outro
Impulse, I am pleased to announce that you are the Winner of the Bechdel test award for the Season 9 opener. :)  Still can’t believe y’all took on a Woodland Mansion first ep with no armour. That’s Hermitcraft for you.   It was amusing watching the other hermits’ episodes and them all thinking you were fighting raids. xD  I really like the shape and building of the starter house but I don’t feel the cobblestone/amethyst combo. But I love all the detailing you’re doing.   If I could make a suggestion for that lectern you need hidden on the balcony: booshes. Booshes everywhere!!  I am happy to see you with close neighbours again and that you invited Tango too. This season is going to be amazing and absolutely falwless! I wonder what will be the orange concrete this season 🤔
Oh buT THE *BEHIND YOU GEM!*  I’m dying.
Episode 1: “Ok guys let’s just get started here we got some iron and…” Episode 2: “HEY GUYS HOW YA DOIN WEVE HAD SOME PRETTY SLOW PROGRESS ON CREATING THE UTOPIA WERE ONLY 93.79% DONE BY NOW IM PRETTY SURE BUT WHATEVER TODAY WELL BE BUILDING OUR 32ND HYPER-EFFICIENT MEGA FARM WE DONT NEED…”
Not too long at all. Happy to watch these anytime.
Do you need to go exploring for flowers? Or is it because...Exploring is fun!
How does the algorithm feel about releasing multiple videos quickly? Other than the editors cut, I think this could easily have been two episodes! 1 and 1.5?
Impulse: ohhh that's a long fall.  Me: LOL. but, not as long as the Caves N Cliffs advancement. Not as long by half.  LOL
So funny how Gem and Impulse are typically the most wholesome Hermits and yet, when they get together, they are so hilariously chaotic 😆 Love that they’re neighbors and that Tango’s close by too!
The sound of Bdubs falling down the hole and his scream getting louder and louder cracked me up. Can't wait to see his perspective!
Maybe put some Snow in the Skele-farm & turn those boring normal arrow drops into Slowness arrows? Also YAY season 9!
You showing your age impulse Is the best thing happening aside from that hole joke 😂
Gem and impulse are both people who sound like they're always smiling. I hope they interact more this season :D
How can I join
Impulse being gentleman with 3 girls
I feel like theres something behind Gem
Use stairs instead of trap doors to cut that corner on the porch
Gonna love some first day fun and chaos moments in Hermitcraft 😄
I'M EXCITED
Hey dude, this seemed like a nice balance of youtuber voice for this season, since I saw in streams that you were concerned about it. :D
I Love Spruce!!!!!
never would've thought amethyst and cobblestone of all blocks would look so good together
Impulse!! Wonderful first episode! The clips of you exploring with the girls and caving had me absolutely dying with laughter. So hyped for this new season and lots more wonderful content from all of you <3
This has harem energy
Ok, so before I watch I am just going to say NO to that roof!   Gross!  I caught a glimpse in your neighbors video.  I'm triggered.  Also, hell yeah!  New season, woot!
maybe use glow lichen instead of signs on the skelli farm elevator
I'm surprise you guys didn't took over the mansion and turn it into a base of sorts.
What an amazing season it will be :D
Hey Impulse for the issue on the porch with the trapdoors and how they line up you can just cut back one space on either side and have a couple solid blocks in the corners. Leaves room for decorations and solves the issue
yayyy its back!
Excellent HC start! Missed you guys.
“Gem is great” — Season 8 “Behind you, Gem!” — Season 9
Can u please tell us the seed
I absolutely loved your episode! So many new jokes and shenanigans came out of your little group! I especially loved the Ladder Falling Creeper, The Iron Pick bit, your Show You The World death (especially when I saw it from other povs and your voice just cut out from them), and All the "BEHIND YOU, GEM!"s. So great!
Exploring is Fun!.. and someti 'BEHIND YOU GEM!'
No skiz:( I'm not mad, Just disappointed.
THANK YOU SIR for having a transition from.s8 to S9 <3
ngl, the outro is kinda bad......
Starting season 9 is fun!
Why does Gem have an owl on the back of her head?
Love the Imp Gem collab :D You guys are so funny playing together 😂
Watching a time-lapse is extra fun when in the background you can see other buildings also being built. The magic of Hermitcraft.
No Etho?
Great episode i dont think i have laughed that hard in a long time!!!
I am immeasurably disappointed that there wasn't a single "Exploring is fun!!!" remark
At last!... also where is etho?
Efficiency IV isnt the same as efficiency V
Impulse and Gem- the wholesome duo ya didn't know ya needed
Seeing impulse waste more diamonds on a second pickaxe hurts... its easier to build a grindstone to get rid of the enchantment and reuse the same pickaxe Edit: yay!!! He didn't forget about the grindstone!!!
36:50 you could just put a barrel in that corner.
Is etho not doing this season
Impulse i think u need a snickers..ur not ur self..with all that dying i think u were channeling Scar lol
SEASON 9 HYPEEEEE .. LETS GOOOOOO WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!
On the corner of the deck you could use stairs as a seating area and use tables and things
👍💞👍
You should add light blocks every ten or so blocks in the bubble elevator hole so you can see the blocks going by
8:56 Impulse, you're a boomer 😅🤣😂
Sooo who's going to tell Impulse he's Trending on YouTube right now? Number 20 at this point...
Ooh you with  3grils :p
For the corner lectern and maybe put a map in an item frame coloured brown
NEW SEASON WOO!!!!! lets go in so excited dude, seeing all the hermits together is just a very....different feeling and I absolutely love it! Im hoping to see more Impulse and gem duo content this season :D
love it brother !!! Keep it up
All of us who watch hermitcraft love the long videos
How about a cauldron with a bush on top for the corner where a trap door wont fit?
Second time watching is just as fun as the first.
Am I the only one whos gonna mention that its 001, and not just 1, does that mean were going into the hundreds meaning the series is gonna last longer.
Love the new Outro!!!!!
Because mansions are fun! Such a great start to the season 😊
Excited for another season! Your starter base house is beautiful
Put a bush in the corner to cover your lectern maybe?
For that corner on the patio, why not add a few oak or spruce stair blocks and make like a corner chair, and maybe throw up a small outdoor table with an umbrella or something to make it look like a social area.  I know that's a lot of work for one block, but I have a feeling you've done a lot more for minor build inconveniences. ;3
Loved the Gempulse collab!
Oh, no! Gem and Pearl not knowing Alanis Moresette just made me feel absolutely ancient 😅 Someone should sit them both down and have a 1990-2005 music marathon.
Last season started with "Gem is Great!" this season started with "Behind you Gem!"
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈
"Oh boy, its long" -and thats what she said 24:35
Hoping for some DERPing this season.
I really like the ?new? incidental music in the beginning. It really made the exploring parts feel like a journey. :)
i would love to explore gems hole 😂
A little Doc?  Docm77 already "built" one....
For the awkward corner of the patio you could hide it with a BBQ. A blast furnace right in the corner with a smooth stone slab to the side, an upside down stone brick stair above and, an item frame with a steak/ cooked chicken on the slab.
cauldrin in the corner
#20 ON TRENDING
uhm... where's Etho?
Impulse trying to sing Alanis Morrissette to people who probably weren’t alive when Jagged Little Pill came out is hilarious.
The time I was watching you four in the mansion and the caves, I couldn't help but think of Charlie's Angels LOL
The enchantment shop will be like i trade2.0
Never seen someone use a mix of cobble and amethyst before
Thank you for the amazing birthday gift.
Gem and Impulse are the best team ever. They work amazing together and it is so funny to watch them interact like two siblings!
Is Pooka editing this Impulse or are you?
Gems voice is so soothing paired with impulse
So cool!
I think I’m in love with gem
Impulse is just casually hanging out with girls
Just a fyi on the skeleton farm, that one only died because he got caught in the crossfire when they were shooting you and Gem lol The y level should be fine.
Man I already missed hermitcraft, just on time for  HC9
Season 9 is here and ready universe is balanced again
Can tell poka didn't edit this the thumbnails were so much cooler was hoping it would be for hermitcraft too..
Thanks for the awesome video. Impulse The HERO to all, so glad to see the server up and running again!! ♥️
loved the episode!!
yaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!! ive been board for so long im so exited
Love the Tudor style of the house
So hyped for this season. Love the new groups forming, Impulse and gem is a great team up. I love that everyone is close again, atleast for now.
Great content! The beginning was like Impulse's Angels
Does Gem lose her Canadian Membership for not knowing Alanis Morrisette? 🤔 🍁
#21 on trending!!!!!!
You can't say you're not a builder anymore :)
Who else thinks that the first remix song for season 9 should be “Behind you Gem!”
No new Hermits???
@28:02 might just be the funniest bdubs moment ive ever witnessed!
I really really hope that this season is longer like season 6
I love your roof and walls! I've been doing a lot of a similar wall style but that roof design seriously blew my mind! always inspiring me to up my game!
YOOOOOO FINALLY
So you are setting up an "Impchantment" business?
Very well anticipated video.  Bravo!
10:14 - *for the third? time* "Behind you Gem!" XD Hahahahahaha! 😂
when you sung "isnt it ironic" and they just stood there confused
lol It looks like no one will be able to monopolize the dark oak here... unlike in Last Life series xD -and then came along... Scar --i hope not.. that's too big a task to do   I am loving this team!!
No etho this season??
Impulse the ladies' man
Great base Impy. I thimk some large custom trees would accent this lovely build. I believe you can do them.
"He didn't get in the boat, Gem!" 🤣😂
I’m so excited for hermit craft!
For the corner Lectern situation, just stop the rails 2 blocks from the end on all sides rather than 1 block.
39:42
that is going to be impulses catchphrase this season. "Behind you Gem!"
"BEHIND YOU GEM" needs to be a shirt now XD
Best episode so far!!!  Bravo!!!!
Behind you Impulse!!! Look! A whole bunch of viewers that got your back because they love you, and your work. This episode was so exciting with the exploration, group collaboration, resource gathering, danger, building, and hilarious moments of struggle. Thank you!!! <3 ~respect
Great start to the season! :)
Very fun first episode, loved the mansion raid with the gang.
You could put a composter or cauldron as a planterbox in the corner to hide the railing on the balcony. And then some bushes ontop of it.
I think it’s funny that they don’t know the “isn’t it ironic pick” 😆 I’m way younger then them and I know it
Your practice at building is paying off. That's a great looking starter house. It would be perfect as a base in anyone's solo survival.
Are you able to stream on that server or is it recording only?
Timestamp 30:50. You could put a barrel there.
BEHIND YOU GEM!!!
There's something about falling in minecraft that makes my stomach drop, too, hahaha. The spawner is so deep...
i was really hoping to see your pov of zedaph's jumps! i'll be checking tango's video to see if he did it, but even if it's just a short, i would love those cut off screams lol thanks for the awesome video!!
This building is really good! So well done!
Oh! I never realised that was an Alanis Morissette reference, and I'm definitely the right generation to recognise that one. Thanks for explaining it!
Boatem is back
A double geode farm could be really cool, those are hard to automate
You spoil us so much, Impulse. Not only was it a joy to watch your start, but now I can watch the "Deleted Scenes" too?! Tysm
My friend and I have an Realm and our Nether portal spawned us in a Basalt delta. Glad to see the Hermits now know our pain lollllll
There should be a “Gem! Behind you!!” Montage
The new outro is really nice! Much prefer it to the previous one.
Your starter base looks amazing!!!! I love it so much
I cant believe S9 is already here. I cant wait to see what this season goes.  Love the build Impulse, as I am getting some medieval/Nordic vibes from it.
SEASON 9 HYPE!! What a crazy start! Of course you would take on a woodland mansion so quickly LOL. Excited to see what you get up to this season!
It seems most people dislike basalt deltas. I like how they look. They can be a pain to navigate though
All the pre-work on the house was worth it.  Looks great! Especially next to Tango's, they blend well.
I definitely wouldn't mind long episodes  Excited to watch more footage on your other channel .
Can you use the zombie spawner and convert them to drowned and make a copper farm? Just walk over a little bit and you’ll have two farms super close to each other?
Impulse! To cover the weird lectern corner: maybe place a composter, filled with compost, and then a fencepost-mini-tree? It'll add a cool decoration while hiding the awkward corner
That Yolo was Golden. Also, years of playing with Skizz have clearly had an effect. Poor Gem would have been in real trouble without you.
Just so you know…*always* dig around any diamonds you find as they can be disconnected by 1-2 blocks now!! I’ve only seen one or two hermits who dig around a little when they find diamonds.
You should make the shopping district into the woodland mansion. It could be like a shopping mall and you could occupy all the different rooms. Because there is a finite amount of rooms, trading them could be quite fun.
I don't understand why none of the Hermicraft players use *Distant horizons* to show off the landscape and their builds.
Should of took out the water, for when bdubs fell. That would have been funny, thats how tango tek kill bdubs in season 8. Good times lol.
i love this combo of hermits!!
👏
Make the zombie spawner into a drowned copper farm!
I was dying during the Alanis part. I was singing right along with you!! 🎵 It's like raaaaaaain on your wedding day 🎵
I feel like it would be cool to turn the empty mansion into a mini game or something...
love the videos but its tooo dark !!!
They didn’t get the diamond behind the big statue head
Sad to not see Etho.
O what i have waited for this
Wahooooooo best day ever, so glad to see Hermitcraft back. Love the starter house, not quite sure I would say starter base, thats bigger than most of everything I've built. So excited to see what you have planned for the season
I’m sorry man. I want to respect you. I really do, because it looks so good, but you built with bird poop, and I just can’t bring myself to respect all of this. I love the build though. Especially the door.
clear out woodland mansion then get iron.
The strain in impulse's voice everytime he says, "BEHIND YOU GEM" had me cry laughing 😂
this was such a fun episode! the timelapse especially was so cool, seeing your build progress and other hermits builds pop up in the background
35:50 Probably my favorite starter build so far. You can say that it's just a single house, but it combines so many different blocks to add layers of depth into one building that it really stands out as cool. It honestly feels like this is a culmination of the improvements you've learned over the last two years, even if it isn't some mega project like the candy factory or ocean base.
i love you hanging out with the ladies, brings out your charm!
Like the style on the house, you have come a really long way!
love the mix of cobble and amethyst for the roof!
My heart hurt at that absolutely perfect Alanis Morissette "Isn't it ironic" reference falling that. Don't worry, Impulse, I heard it and smiled immediately. I remember the song coming out, but forgot what year. My heart hurt again (and also my back) at looking it up and seeing it came out in 1995.
New Season Lets Gooo! :)
just a suggestion for the skele/zombie spawners...... maybe haveit be a two person xp farm?  make a quick mine cart trip that circles both farms or comes close enough to each in a circle to activate it..  anyone who goes afk can hop in the cart and ride, while anyone who is around can hit it up for xp and loot!
28:04 the way B-Dubs came falling down just killed me 😂😂
new lighting rules don't apply to spawners
Impulse, you should have committed to the Atlanta morissette references with a "you you you Ought to know!" When they had no idea what you were referencing 😂
Impulse showing off with the lecterns, redstone lamps, and amethyst blocks
Will y'all be doing a shopping district this season?
Great elevator music, Impulse .  Actually it's a very good first season 9 video.
Your starter base looks like a tavern to me!
A Brit, an American, a Canadian, and an Aussie walk into a mansion…
I hated that Stereo effect in the beginning of the video, where they all are having the beginning meeting. I don’t know if it’s doing it for some of you guys that are on a pc watching it, but I could really tell it’s there on an iPhone.
13:18  Everyone: say the line!
I am living for this duo
8:44 ok now I feel REALLY OLD lol
Happy once again.
Impulse and The Ladies... probably my new favorite group!
You only have 12 book shelves also you can put it in a grindstone and get the levels back plus take the enchantments off the pic and try again
Can’t wait how this now as I’m at the hair salon, but saw the thumbnail and thought “who would think to put amethyst with cobblestone? Bold!” Can’t WAIT to watch. Yours will be the first ♥️
In the corner on the terrace, you can place a terracotta block to cover the lectern and make a small custom tree with a fence post and some leaf blocks.
So cool to see Impulse hanging out with the girls :)
8:40 OH! That WAS Alanis Morisette! I thought it was one of the other women of that era, Natalie Imbruglia(or however the heck her name is spelled)!!! Jeez, I was half giving Gem crap about being too young to know and here I am completely confusing two women!
Big change of a start compared to such a slow and cautious hardcore start lol
Double geode, nice! The starter base looks gorgeous, maybe for the corner where you can't put trap doors on both sides you could put a full block instead, like a barrel maybe? Also, I love that you included a little flashback to the cliffhanger from last season at the start!
That is so funny Gem not looking behind her mobs keep almost killing her and Impulse Behind You Gem that need to be a shirt for her now with a Creeper about to blow up LOL
"Behind you Gem!" might not be the most intimidating battle cry, but it just might be the most useful.
Gem and Impulse set the theme for HC9; signs expressing what actions the other player are doing while they are being watched. Great video Impulse. the interactions and cooperation between Hermits is what sets this series apart.
Woooo!!!!!
The corner should have a staircase
Impulse and Gem is almost as iconic a duo as impulse and skizz! Almost. 😂 I'm fairly certain that Gem would have died at least 5 more times if impulse hadn't been watching her back! 🤣👍
001 sounds promising!
Canadian misses an Alanis Morissette reference. Canada: You have brought shame upon our people.
If you’re opening a shop then I think it should be called “Impulse Buy”
7:54 "We gotta go do like actual first day stuff."  considering that you're playing on hermitcraft i don't think you understand what 'first day stuff' actually means.
Starter base looks great… composted planter box in the corner to hide the lecturn..with an azalea leaf on top.  This is going to be a great season based on Ep 1!
Imagine owning an entire mansion only for 3 girls and a guy to completely ransack your home relentlessly. Who's the pillager now?
How about a good ol fashioned cauldron planter in the corner to cover up that lectern 😉
Hey :)
the fact that no one has made an "Impulse's angels" comment yet both shocks me, and makes me happy that I got to it first.
Why does the back of Gem’s head look like the front of Keralis’ head?
Your chemistry with Gem is fantastic. I’m happy to see a starter community where some hermits will live together for a while.
Your starter base incorporates your favorite color! Love the amethyst roof. Yay for Season 9!
Impulse you should stream hermit craft also
3:10 confirmation, Impulse is an isekai protagonist. First day raiding something with a harem of girls XD
To cover up the lectern maybe put a poted plant, or poted azalea bush
Impulse 36:40 remove one trap door and put a barrel in the corner.
keep seeing Keralis on the back of Gem's head.
its a very impulsive build :)
Been watching the Hardcore so much I thought this was a joke until the other hermits popped into my inbox lmao
I think tuff on the roof would look way better than cobble. Just a suggestion
It’s huge
I LOVE your home
I like how impulse killed the evokes and didint get a totem
How about putting a potted tree/bush plant in front of the lectern to hide it
Gem is so cutee
Yay season 9 😃😜
Oh, goodness. Crying from laughing at all the escapades in the mansion and mines. I love the Hermits and how much fun you have together, always brightens my day 🖤™️
Great first eppi!!!! Also I love the triple Timelapse of your build and the white tower and Tango’s house! Lol
Impulse getting the chicks
Long have I waited
So pumped for the new season.   Naked and Scared videos were the first non tutorial Minecraft videos I ever watched.   Those led me to you and Hermitcraft.  I appreciate your content and am so glad you are hitting this season as a full time creator.  Looking forward to all the fun.
Impulse and pearl are a work couple for the ages!
amazing you guys are crazy at building
The four of you conquered a mansion on day one! Legends
Quote of the episode "they're behind you Gem" with close runner up "they're babies Impulse"
Who got the totems? The fact that they didn't seem to care about  them made me go brrr
Hermitcraft season nine will start tomorrow
I'm so excited to see where Impearlescent Tay goes
Wait what slow down in 32:00 and am I only one who saw pearl flying?   Never mind it’s just lag
Impulse got two totems from the mansion, but left with none. What happened?
Tango: "The video is still a little bit long. If you made it this far..." Me:  "I've been watching HC videos since season 9 went live. And I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one."
will there be a shopping district?
"Behind you gem!" literally had me crying laughing 🤣🤣🤣
Whenever two spawners are slightly too far away from each other you could always just build a rail cart and a gathering area that moves between the two of them to activate both of them at the same time and it works
Awesome!
Your working with the new ppl all season? disappointed! Guess I will watch someone else instead!
At the corner u can maybe put a composter and make a potted plant with some bushes.
It’s like RAAAAIIIIIAAAAAAiiiiiin!!! on your wedding day!!!!🎶🎤🎵

Kinda showing your age there impulse with the Alanis Morissette song haha
Now featuring the “BEHIND YOU GEM!!!!!!” T-shirts
Impulse and Gem are the duo I never knew I needed, but I absolutely do
YES!
I love your starter base :)  This was lots of fun to watch :)  I wish I knew where I could see everyone's videos, because I don't know who all is a part of Hermicraft...
nice!
YESDSSSSSASDASDASFASFGSDGSFGD
Lmfao love the Alanis reference
You could put a full block in that corner, maybe a barrel or something, maybe make it a lamp post or something
Good song, impulse!!! I'm glad to looked it up
It’s like raiiiiiiiiyaiiiiiiiin on your wedding day!!!
YES!
Put a cauldron in the corner and make it a planted tree or bush.
I'm so happy this is on 23 trending
Looks amazing!! So exciting !
Could put a few bushes in front of the lectern on the porch
It’s official impulse, after this time off YOU are the first hermit I am watching to start the season. ‘‘Twas a tough choice, you’re all great
simplest and easiest way to fix corners is to buttress them, extend the corner design one block each direction. That'll solve the problem easily without being an 'eyesore'; in fact, if you do it with upside-down stairs, it'll make a better design.
"I will show you the world as well" had similar vibes to "This is the greatest plan!"
Are you completely sure that the zombie spawner was too far away? I mean you looked from right next to the skelli spawner instead of trying to find a mid-point.
Yay impulse! This is so exciting!
30:36 IV is 4 not 5
Impulse having everyone's back, or just gem. I love to see this series on again. I hope you all get to have a lot of fun
25:38 did he say fortune 4?
Also, I love how so many are like, "I'm going to try to be really careful so I don't give away any spoilers" and Impulse is like, "Wow! Lol how amazing everyone's starter bases are!" 😂😂😂
chaotic "Behind you, Gem!"
I’m loving your group dynamic. You guys hanging out together is great. 💜
Amazing video Impulse
Idea for covering up that lectern impulse, map art of a trapdoor. now obviously this would be wayyyy too expensive
So excited to watch more impulse! Lucky you found two geodes that's a definite rare find! Two awesome farms already!
IT'S HERE!!!!!!
Oh it's started; I didn't know, it was a surprise. Let's see who will use the new spawn mechanics for their design taste and make the most moody base out of it.
impulse you can use a grindstone
impulse your player
You cut your trees down counterclockwise?
FINALLY, HERMITCEAFT SEASON9!!!!!
This is my favorite season, because this is my favorite number!
looks like a great start impulse ,
You should set up in the mansion.  There is no bigger flex than setting up a starter base in a mansion.  I do like your house though.  I would have never thought to use the amethyst for a roof like that.
Impulse can turn the zombie spawner into a copper farm
my favorite thing about new hermicraft seasons is seeing what the hermits think constitutes a 'starter' base
This is amazing. I haven't really been on MC that much the last few months, and I have a lot of catching up to do with what is new in the game. I can't wait for all the fun and inspiration that I'm sure will come with this new season of HC.
It's always so nice to see you all together again 🤗😊
So happy to see all the hermits together again!
with new 8d headphones i can now fully experience the proxy voice!
All these gifts and it's not even my Birthday!
Does this mean hardcore dies!?
I really love the starter house - the mix of amethyst and cobblestone is a combo I never thought of putting together but it looks great!
An American, a Canadian, an Australian, and a British person walk into a woodland mansion...
What data pack do you use?
The sign should say “Skizz” and then everybody would know that she stops for coal
Shenanigans ensue!!! Loved it, looking forward to season 9
The Gem and ImpulseSV tandem is like a father and daughter --- i mean brother and younger sister playing minecraft. It's so wholesome. The chemistry''s fantastic
Dang, I was hoping Skizzleman would be added to Hermitcraft
there is no risk tho :P u take a grind stone and remove it, then u just have to grind 1 level :P
I want someone to make fanart of impulse yelling "Behind you Gem!" looking stressed and pulling his hair as Gem just happily walks along with a bunch of mobs following her. 😂😂😂
Absolutely LOVE how you guys are going to be more close knit for the beginning!! So many collaboration opportunities!!
Teaming with Gem and Pearl this year...this is going to be good. Your  starter base looks fantastic, great start to season 9.
Gem and Impulse are a great combo!
Impulse, Pearl, and Gem will now forever be known as the "Soup gang"
Loving the build, It looks amazing. I especially love the roof pallet.  I never would have thought to use amethyst and cobble like that.  If you're still looking for ides about that exposed lectern have you considered putting a composter there to act as a corner potted plant?  Just add some leaves on the top to complete the look.
Where is Etho btw isn't he playing? I haven't seen him.
Impulse casually taking all the women from the server for adventure on first day.
I am confused, Do the hermits decide before hand who they're gonna spend the season with or do they just work in the moment.
Impulse and Gem is a duo i didn’t know I needed  but I now can’t get enough of
I was so lost “why did impulse move his house from the cave?” And then I screamed! So happy and can’t wait to see the journey of both. As Hannah Montana said, it’s the best of both worlds.
"Isn't it ironpick"... dead silence. 🤣🤣🤣 Editing to say great video! Best starting intro I've seen so far with the tie in from last season. Oh and the laughs all over!
👍
Looking forward to a nice looooooooong season 9, where starter bases are starter bases. ;)
Exploring is FUN!
try stairs to hide the lecturns
I am so looking forward to this season! Love your new outro btw :D
Put a cauldron on that corner and make it a potted plant area :)
This episode should have been called behind you gem
“OUR skeleton spawner” lol
If you REALLY don't like that corner you could make a map that has the trapdoor texture and put those in the corner. But that seems really hard for just one corner. You know what nevermind.
@32:15 in the vid you can see perlecent moon travel travel really fast almost as if in creative mode for some reason I know the hermits are not cheaters so I'm just curious why that would happen or if it's some type of glitch
Uuurh they such babies. Even though technically I am, but I grew up with 80s music. Can't go wrong there
This is indeed wild. Episode 1 - woodland mansion raid? You guys are amazingly crazy. I love it!
So glad to see hermitcraft back
‘It’s not an island.’ ‘We could make it an island?’  Damn hermits already considering attempting large scale projects in their first episode
Canadian Gem should know Alanis Morsette
Maybe you can put a composter with leaves on top to make a big flower pot in that corner? 🤔😊
This entire video, and others from all u hermits gave me such positive energy today. I reallly needed it, and i'm glad the season 9 is here already! Its gonna be a blast~
Composter in the balcony corner, with leaves set on top?
Exploring with friends is fun!
So sad etho didn't make it
Impulse, for that corner lectern on the patio, try doing a corner stair. not sure how it'll look, but it's worth a shot.
Impy and the Gals!! You all seem to be having alot of fun :D
jh
mjmh
mhhg
jg
They don't know Alanis Morissette? Find a new group.
Love to have you guys back!
I'm not sure if this is a thing but you could try putting a painting or an item frame on the corner
I love this, you can see the hardcore reflexes kicking in!
I love the creativity in the story line great to see hermitcraft back and running 💛
you should call your starter house 'villa volta', its a reference to a ride from the dutch theme park the 'efteling'
oOoOO finally HERMITCRAFT SEASON 9. Btw impulse have harem in the first eps 🤣👍
"Gem, Behind you!"    Gem:  "Yeah yeah yeah."
Imagine Playing on Medium Salmon edition
I know someone with diamonds, that could use some sparkly new boots! ;) I shall offer terms! :P
I really get confused...you put those enchantments on all yours stuff anyway...why do you all keep thinking they're crap?  They're like...guaranteed to go on your stuff.  Yeah, I get it...you wanted something else...but jeez, at least you don't have to try and get them later or something. . I dunno...just sounds like a choosing beggar to me.  And literally all of the Hermits do it.  If all I've got is rotten food...or no food at all, I'm gonna be perfectly happy if I get some broccoli.
All the weird and wacky builds so close to each other looks like a cartoon town
The music this episode was great
Sorry, I don’t really like the see through leaves…but good video anyways!
Impulse dies enough to make up for the hardcore world.   Gemini 'Behind You' Tay Season 10: Starter base built from dragon eggs and wither stars.
Gem and impulse is very entertaining to see work together 🙂
I hope this season gets a shopping district. Last season we didn't have one, and that was one of the weakest seasons imo.
bdubs scream from long drop was so funny
What happened with being so dramatic?
i just started the video and i dont see skizzleman ... i am very disappointed the hermits are missing out on a very good addition to the cast .
25:38 did he just say fortune IV
Check out BrunoDanUy's video on the flooded geodes, makes them so easy to harvest with Fortune 3 and collection via water streams.
The tag team of Gempulse is too precious.
“Behind you gem” count- 3
8:50 - that awkward silence with Gem, Cleo, and Pearl staring at Impulse...
It never gets old seeing the Hermits 'starter bases' being better than most people full bases.
Can't wait to see the "Impchant" setup
There back......
First thing you do should be to speed run the game  Since you can get amazing loot In The end plus you could make a shop with the elytra
first things first, impulse bg music is so good
OHH ME I CHUN CHAN 9:20
I always find enchanting iron to fortune 3 is easier early game
Good guy impulse. Chivalry is not dead.
Impulse keeps claiming to not be much of a builder and then builds absolutely gorgeous buildings like this.
WooHoo!!!!!!  I've been waiting for this day since the Moon started getting BIG.  (Saw that one coming a mile away.)   I shall be parked on my couch until I see them ALL!  Love me some Hermits🌻❤🌻
Impulse is with the ladies Impulse is the idea man Impulse is the Idealadies man
From gem is great, to behind you gem  Somebody make a sign
I knew I was going to watch your video first and I am SO GLAD I did. Welcome back to Hermitland!! What an action packed first episode. Love it.
It's sad that Etho didn't make it to the beginning of the season
I like this collaboration. :)
iChant or iEnchant is coming as the first shop
Oh no! Gem has her airpods in
your starter base looks absolutely beautiful impulse!! I love the whole aesthetic :D
Boatem should stay together this time also
impulse with the ladies :)
Did he say Fortune 4
i have been waiting WAY TOO LONG!
Great job on the starter base!
It's nice to see you out of hardcore where you are free to die and take risks and have fun at the mansion.
The new map looks beautiful at spawn with the mountains and trees
Gems is gonna be the new scar. In fact by the end of the season she may rival scar for most deaths.
Straay farm
Suggestion for the skeleton and zombie spawned, you can add a roller coaster activating them both while riding it.  Credits for this idea go to wadzee
In the corner where the trapdoors don't line up, put a composter, fill it up, then put azalea leaves on top to make it into a nice little flower pot
And...there's the catchphrase for the season... . "Behind You, Gem!"
Hey Impulse how many times do you plan to blow up and remake your base this season?🤣
Great start of the season Impulse! Love the starter house and great job keeping Gem safe.
jits, zit, and now pig (pearl, impulse, and gem)
Put some dirt in that porch corner and turn it into a planter for an ornamental tree. ( fence post and leafblocks.) Will cover up that awkward lectern.
That was rough luck with the enchantment table.
My mind went to "isnt I R O N P I C K K C I P N O R I"
What a wonderful start to the season and such a good watch. I can't wait for what's to come :)
my boy just won his first hockey game today! can i get a shout out for #14
Behind you gem! (You should use stairs to cover the corner lecturns as small tables)
Sus
"I will show you the world as weeeeelllll!"  Oh my word that had such "this is the greatest plan" energy, Impulse, I'm calling you Charles from now on. (9:05)
For the building time lapse who’s base is that white tower in the back
I didn’t see Etho ): I hope he is on the server or atleast okay
Only in Hermitcraft would you see people raid a woodland mansion on Day 1.
Put a potted plant in the corner
i’m in love with this trio!!! it’s like the chaos twins and their babysitter 😂😂
SO EXCITED FOR THIS NEW SEASON!!!! <3 <3 <3
Omg, the "It's it iron pick" bit is always the thing that makes my friends go "Why tf do you say it like that"
Did you know that if you use a dandelion to make suspicious stew it gives saturation, and is like an early instant health potion!
There starter bases look like my mega base
For the corners you could use a composter and a leaf block on top of it so it looks like a potted plant =) Love the starter house!
New season right on my birthday best birthday gift :D
impulse they gen z or smthing, wont know Ironic song x3
Damn impulse starting strong with the harrem
You know what a good idea is for the skeleton farm if you just add powdered snow right where they drop and they'll turn them into strays so then you can also have slowness arrows and a better loot table
I genuinely never put isn't it an iron pick and isn't it ironic together. I feel totally wooshed.   Btw, hilarious showing the age difference of the newer members.
"Exploring is fun! Even for the death prone" Great start to a season
Really like the roof
10:54 that one there was a violation lmao.
Hi Impulse, Im a long sub i have probably followed you since your first season on Hermitcraft and been a Patreon from time to time and really like your content! But i have noticed that your editing style has change drasticly pretty much when you made the hardcore series and now even in the hermitcraft episode. It feels like you are just making a highlight real from a stream and not liek before when you always where involving the viewer in you amazing projects and fun with friends. Please consider going back to you previous editing style which is according to me combined with you skills and personallity the thing that makes you the best hermit! Best regards, Worried fan
I AM SO HAPPY! Glad to see hermits out! But let me hold up and just gush about your house and the build style. I am so excited to watch you build and have fun this season!
So Impulse had rain on his wedding day, Pearl got a free ride when she already paid, Gem got some good advise that she just couldn't take, and Cleo thought to figure...  ; )
Not me crying because I didn’t think hermitcraft would be out this soon and it’s literally the joy and chaos I needed right now in my life
You forgot the other diamond you found
Gem is like, if you mixed Lisa Simpson and Lolz or Roffle from Charlie the Unicorn.
I'd love for the Enchant store to be called inchant to keep up with the Impulse stuff
WOW!!! I lovvvvvvvve your starter base... for me that doesn't even look starter!!!! It is sooooo big!!!😍😍😍
I see that impulse is quite the ladies' man!
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay😍🥳
You and I have the same issue with building. Rectangles and squares
36:49 Remove the other trap door in the corner and drop a cauldron or composter there and put a topiary-style tree or some leaves or something so it looks like a decorative effec t in the corner.
Put a barrel in the corner with a plant in a pot on top
I love the starter base feels like something wells made
I like how this is turning out to be Impulse's Harem anime already
YEEEEEAAAAAYY SO HYPE
Impulse’s catch phrase this series: “Behind you Gem!”
36:01 If I didn't see the time-lapse, I would assume the building was copy pasted in
Great video man.
36:39 Put a barrel in the corner. Similar texture to the trap doors and also more storage!
I like how impulse cut out the part where he found a lush cave and forgot to get moss :D
Yay!
Compostor infront of the lecturn with leaves on top 2 high for a plant pot. Gr8 start, loving the content.
Impulse>>>>Alanis Morissette Loving the new season! Starter base looking amazing, season 9 hype!!
Hey Impulse, you're good with redstone, right? Can you, later in the season, make like a living hive themed base with dead brain coral, honeycomb, and slime blocks? By "living" I mean has a heartbeat like Hermitcraft 7 Mumbo's base, has pistons in walls to mimic breathing, has more pistons in the walls to randomly change the layout (between like 5 different configurations, if possible) every now and then, and requires you to actively maintain it to keep it "alive".
I'm very happy seeing you optimistic enough to number this episode 001. I really hope this series lasts for hundrets of episodes!!!
Cornorplanterbox. Definetly. Love your videos, thanks for all you do =)
Already an amazing start to the season! The base is AMAZING and I am so excited about the starter village thing. Also laughing because s8 was "Gem is great!" and s9 is "BEHIND YOU, GEM!" lolol
NEVER until today have I seen a man conquer a woodland mansion with a stone sword,  NO armour and  3 friends
I literally raised my hands when you got fortune like, "Success!!!!"
you need to make a button that says when you press it "behind you gem"
You sounded like bdubs! "I’m brave!!"
Finallyyy
The crimson tree grew through the floor most likely...not on soulsand
I love how every time someone killed an Evoker, they were immediately slain by a Vex. :)
Made my day!
Make both spawners into farms so 2 ppl can get levels at once
I’m so incited for harmit craft season nine
Super excited for the new season! Not a huge fan of the background music, but that's ok. So happy Hermitcraft is back!
Ok, im not panicking... where is etho?
So many dirty jokes...I will refrain...lol
I knew the song Impulse! Don't you worry I sang along :)
Have been waiting for this for soooooo long
only in hermitcraft is this considered a starter base.
37:00 Shouod have taken a page from Bdoubs' book instead ;)
YESS it's back I'm so excited :D
Also, your base would look amazing with a couple of Gem's custom trees out front
ı really thought hermitcraft was canceled cuz it took a long time for 9 to appear
Wonder what the seed is
With your railing, put a barrel there and some stuff around it to look like storage.
Gem's so great at making stuff look good!
31:23 Now that's good for pvp
That is such a cool unique starter base.
IT'S LIKE RAIAIIIIIIIIN
Hermitcraft season 8: I didn´t finish the back of my base. Hermitcraft season 9: I didn´t finish the interior.
Put a bar and some guestrooms in there and call the building the inn-pulse :)
Use an item frame with the lectern
Glow lichen stops water from flowing, so its perfect for your bubble elevator, and will probably fit in with the design of the room.
mob spawners have a 16 block radius didnt they both work? if you’re 16 blocks away from one didn’t the other work? just curious
For the corner, put a block there and put the trap doors around it. Like a dirt block and make it into another planter.
Classic Impulse always going big and extra.
centeral marketplace?
Impulse looking for Amethyst, call him Gempulse
here, you might need this:  ------------------------------ | will stop for coal | |           : )                 | ------------------------------              ||              ||              ||
Fortune 4 :)
The starter bases just keep getting bigger and bigger with every season
20:53 we all were expecting that dialogue in hc
Welcome back Impulse!
oh yeah I love fortune 4
Ur starter base is still bigger than my bases ever r 😂 love it tho
8:45 - Come on Impulse, commit to the bit! "IT'S LIKE RAI-I-AAAA-AAAAIN ON YOUR WEDDING DAY"
This is like a cool uncle and an excited niece working together xD Can't wait to have 10-to-14 months of this :))
Grian thinking to start a war...!!!
Etho is not here TvT . Love your video bte impulse
Great way to start the season, can’t wait!!!!
You should install some elevator music for that long ride!
Grian found 1:17 and 1:18
27:05  the way he change his tone to greet bdub xD
great to see you all back on Hermitcraft.
8:30 - Of course they're not going to know Alanis Morissette, Impulse...  They could look up the video and listen to the song and it's still not going to mean anything to them. Honestly I'm surprised Mumbo even makes Oasis references
The starter base reminds me of the Winchester Mansion with that door to nowhere.😝
Officially our first season 9 episode! Me and the kids are spending the afternoon watching all the episodes out today!
I was having a bad day but nothing cheers you up like a new season of Hermitcraft.
So excited to see everyone back for season 9!
Love this start❤️
♥ Let's GOOOOO GIPZ's ♥ (yes, that's the first letters of your names combined) The hype is real, the expectations are high and I think it goes without saying you have teamed up really well. I'm foreseeing incredibly detailed eye candy as far as your render-distance will go, with all the conveniences of an automated technical base
Were Grian!!!
I really hope that the season goes on for a long time just like season 6!😊😊😊
Ooooo
Quality content. I watch every hermit but started with you, impulse
Anyone going to talk about how etho wasn’t there 😭
Worth the wait
Impulse you could repurpose the zombie farm and make the zombies drown so it's a drowned farm
So excited for this season!
Im so happy to see this video
Amazing first episode impulse waited ages for this and it was really somthing
Hello Grian,  So glad to see you back. I hope you get together with GeminiTay more this season.  It be great to see what you to can come up with on here. & can not wait to see what you will be doing on here.
I got your Alanis reference and I love it!!! Soooooo happy for season 9!!!!
Random guy: How did you get so strong Muscular guy: I did 1 pushup everytime Impulse said 'Behind you Gem' Random guy: wow
4:58 - You know, I wondered how you guys had managed to pick a fight with a Vex this early in the game...  A Woodland mansion right near spawn? So weird!
I'm super excited. I love the hardcore world, but welcome back hermitcraft!
For your rails you can replace the trapdoors with stairs
Yesssssssssssssssssss
The background music was a bit much.  Imo
I wanna BBQ underneath Impulse's Back porch.
I absolutely love the “Wake up Impulse…” at the start, tying into the whole S8 Simulation shenanigans!
dis gun be good
Thank god u guys r back,  Waiting for it for long time.
*ahem* psst... @Grian 12:07 (you're welcome) ;)
HermitCraft!!!!!
Hi impulse! Just searched hermitcraft 9 and u poped up first! I always watch Grian an haven't watch anyone els in hermitcraft. Btw nice vid! It's 1 am here.
the last season felt like a fever dream in the best possible way, let's hope this season is fun too!
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
little bit of a contrast compered to the hardcore siries
Only took like 3 months
"Go bigger go home" LMAO
Hermitcraft is Fun!
Maaaan impulse wants fortune 4 not just fortune 3, he wants so many shiny blue stones xD.
Can't wait to see "behind you Gem" memes
When I saw the eagle at the end it was just ‘ahh…false is there’
Use a rail road to connect the two farms
My first video for Season 9. So happy the season began
Awesome
Welp, there goes my weekend.
Look at the bright side, a terrible fortress that's all bridges above lava makes for a great wither skeleton farm...
I woke up an said “Now I have to wait until 3pm for hermitcraft” and then!!!!!! I saw this!!!!! I am blessed.
Season 9!!! Can’t wait!
build a rail track and sit in it so it loops around both mob spawner then they both send mobs out
If you put brown carpet on the lecterns it looks like trapdoors and you can do the corners
Gem getting fortune 2, 3 times impulse not getting it till his 5th try is hilarious
29:00 Classic Bdub
"ep 001" which means this season will have more than 100 ep ig
I really like that roof. Never would have thought to mix cobble in with the amethyst.
i really want  Elybeatmaker to turn "Behind you GEM!!" into a remix. Would be great ngl x).
IIIIIMPUUUULLLLSSEEE ISSS BAACK WITH SEASON 9! YESYES!~ I loved when you did -beeeep- and -beeeep- together with -beeeep- ;D Enjoy season 9 amigo!
I kinda want to see some kind of gamma boost mod for the nether. From a content creator/viewer perspective it’s really hard to see on video
It's a sad day for Canada when one of our own doesn't even know who Alanis Morissette is. 😭😭
well, impulse just took a good timelapse tho.. with 2 building in it.. 35:01
Poor Impulse left hanging by an Alanis Morrisette reference.
would be cool if you also have a bookstore again ..
Love the starter base. So awesome!
The fact that this is ep 001 and bot just 1 means it wil be a long season letsgo
Yours is the first s9 ep I'm watching! So excited 😭
Funny start looking forward to future stuff
Your flowers already match your roof really well. I don’t think you need to change them. Also, 10/10 house exterior!
YAY! SEASON 9
Ooooo an I-sland
Everyone: talking    Grian and scar: *peacefully punching stone with their fists*       edit: thanks for 300+ likes:D
Hi Impy!!! You are the first Hermit I've watched today!!!! What an awesome episode! What are the odds that you guys would find a mansion and a skeleton spawner in episode 1!!!! Amazing luck! And I've got to say that I absolutely love your build!!!!! Im going to definitely watch the directors cut later. Off to watch the others...take care...great job!!! 😊
“We’re finally going, we’re finally playing Minecraft together again!” Warmed my heart. I knew I chose to start this relaxing Saturday here!
The mansion raid was hilarious, and the cave shenanigans had me laughing so much
You should have made the mansion for everyone.  A starting room for each hermit!
LETS GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
This HAS to be the best starting episode ever! It's just soooo funny,  I was already excited for this season!!!
For that corner issue use a corner staircase
This is the world I wanted for a long time, too bad we don't hv the seed.....
"If you made it this far" lol you be funny!!! I've been waiting for over a month for hermitcraft season 9 I don't care how long the episode is I'm just happy to see it!
What everyone been waiting for i think hermits having fun and exploring together 😄
I love your base! Its awesome! And it has a back!
Impulse said fortune 4 25:38
If u read this, pls watch behind u for a sec.
Imagine making a base out of the woodland mansion wont it be satisfying seeing it being broken down
WE’RE BACK BABYYYYY
FINALLLLYYYY!!!!!
Is there no etho this season?
S9 yeah!
Where is Etho!
Man's out here building like a printer
I LOVE the amethyst in the roof!!
YES FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING
Woo! HC is back! Excited to see what this season has in store for you and the rest of the hermits! Bdubs falling down the chute with proximity chat on was the perfect hilarious fade XD
Yes I've been waiting glad everyone is back!!!!
Who’s hyped for what’s to come this season?  I am
Season Nine, everythig is fine!
It’s hErE!
I'm still thinking if you ever said "exploring is fun" while adventuring with the hermits
Can anyone see what's holding the water up on the down elevator? I've watched that 4 times and .25 playback speed and I can't make it out.
Impulsive pulled off a Dutch colonial in mc thats awesome
Impulse with all the ladies oooooooooo
Idk much about farming, but maybe you could turn the zombie spawner into a drowned farm and make copper?
Hermitcraft series 9: *starts* 2 minutes later:  GoodTimeWithScar fell from a high place  I will never understand how he managed to survive so long on hardcore.
the starter bases this season are so awesome
I realised that nearly everyone put a episode “001” on their videos, this indicates that this season is going to be long.
12:20 12 fish is valuable to you?
Totally in love with the starter base 🤩 the roof is amazing
The person who kept on guessing what day it would start at finally got it correct XD
28:05 bdub's scream 🤣
13:19 I thought impulse almost said exploring is fun! But he didn't :(
Impulse, for the corners of your back deck you could put some stairs in the corners and turn them into chairs for a lil seating area
Old man Impulse.
Season 9!
25:38 how are you gonna get fortune 4? 😂
This is the most hilarious Seasonstart I've seen ever :D  "Gem, behind you!" will be a thing, I asume :D
I like how the episode is 001 that means we might make it till over 100 :D glad s9 is starting.
After several years!! Finally!!!
25:39 I love to get fortune 4 😂
Getting overwhelmed by all the episodes from both Hermitcraft and Afterlife but I'm loving it!
After long wait it's finally started ♥️♥️
Cool
good to have yall back! not entirely sure if it fits the series structure, but if u were to stick with the group you were with today for the whole season thatd be pretty cool cuz theyre all awesome.
Impulse with 2 totems in 7 mins
finally months of bordem solved with a new hermit craft season!!
Wow, That base looks amazing!!! Can't wait to see what's in store for this season Impulse!!
So Hyped
Amazing episode, king! Lets goooooooooooooooo season 9 babyyyyyyyy, can't wait for the next episode
36:53 for the corner maybe a barrel with a trap door on top?
Impulse if you get powdered snow you can turn the skely farm into a stray farm
was it just me or did anyone elses heart skip a beat when he walked on the snow blocks at 3:00. im so paranoid about powdered snow xD
You could put a table in that corner of your house
So the secret tweet codes were correct!
ok, i'm waiting for the "behind you, Gem" song!
Such a great feeling! Season 9!!!
I had the same problem in my build with the corner lecterns, I just put a crafting table in the corner and it blocks off both lecterns. You can use any work station on the corner.
Oh my god it’s here
9 seasons and the chemistry the hermits have is still refreshing and wholesome
You should cover the corner up with map art of a trap door :D
Noooo it sucks when hermits stick close by
its finally here
wow
Love seeing the interactions between you and Gem in this episode! I'd started watching both of you between seasons and I can't wait to watch you both in the new season!
Impulse is back!   So excited for this season
this is such a great start to the season!
pls bring back the shopping district
I have been waiting so long for this season
Everytime Impulse says; we’ll have to go exploring.. I’m just waiting for the iconic quote but then I remember 😂😂
Like an episode of Impulses Angels.
Yessssssss
IM SO HAPPPY !!!!! 😭😭 not to be dramatic or anything but my life is completely now 😌
Episode 001..hmmmm   You know what that means    100 plus episodes ..let's go baby 🥳
16:09 meth is ilegal gem
I'm getting very "Charlie the Unicorn" Vibes from this gang lol
40 min video is too long
Impulse I think you should do a delivery service where you make a shop and they put they’re orders then you deliver the item / block
8:48 Impulse you have a lovely singing voice and they're complete lack of knowledge on the song hurt my soul too. xD
Welcome back hermits👍🏼❤️ Nice starter base, old cottage with amethyst roof looks really nice 👍🏼 didn't realize you were that good at regular houses, usually you make futuristic.
Definitely NOT Hardcore Hermitcraft Season 9. So many deaths. lol  Edit - For the lectern corners perhaps you could place composters there with the trapdoor on top to tie it all in? :)
I love hermitcraft
Man I missed this so much
Omg! God speaks in Times New Roman
does nobody noticed the person teleporting at 32:15
25:39 fortune 4 lol
For the lectern in the corner, put a block in front of it, and make it into a decoration, light fixture, or possibly just a crafting bench.
Let's goooo 🤯🙌🤟🥳
*hugs* for you all, if you see this comment! :3x Also th3pooka is a cool friend that I was glad to have met in the first place. >:3
yay new season off hermitcaft!
for the balcony, you could take out some of the trapdoors and replace them with full blocks? A little table, a composter-plant, a  little birdhouse on the balcony - anything can fill up the space! You can also add little details like hanging potted plants and vines where you think the blocks are getting to repetitive. Dont be afraid to mix in different blocks in patches! Moss can cling to any corner, and it's so versatile to hang glow berries or spore blossoms off of, or to mix in with some azalea leaves :D  since you want to set up a shop, maybe you could have a welcoming assistant outside the door, and build a little nook for them..?
This is so amazing I wish I could join a sever this supportive and awesome
Hey Impulse, for your corners of the railing made of lecterns, try piston pushing a spruce door over from a block below? Not sure if that still works the way armor stands kind of glitch through blocks.
Once again, I need to remind myself you and the other hermits have been building for years XD What an amazing build! I love your starter base so much, that roof is stunning! :D
No more boatem :(((
You can turn the zombie spawner into a copper farm, by drowning the zombie and turning them into drowneds
i love hermitcraft and i am your bigest fan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GIG  Gem Is Great
Imp, Gem, and Pearl. Be still my beating heart!
Season 9 HYPE
8:43 and like yeeeehiiiyeeeeeee    p.s. yall are very uncultered.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SEASON NINE IS HERE FINALLY YAAAASSSS
My life ends today, and I've never been happier!
For the corner of the porch: maybe a composter with a leaf block on top, that way it looks just like normal decoration
Also: “Am I lost?”
Haha I love Gem... 'Do you want to go make soup together?!' And 'Think of the bookshelves!' Lol So cute. I can't believe you all took on a Woodland Mansion on day 1!! Epic! And the Isn't it Iron Pick scene killed me. So much fun! Awesome start Impulse!!! Love it all!! P.S. Love the new outro graphics and music!
GEM, Impulse and Pearl are 100%, my favorite hermit trio!
BEHIIIIND YOUUUUU GEEEEEEEMMM!!!!!!!!!
starter base looks amazing impulse! If you feel like it, you could take it one step further by:   - adding vines and lichen for ivy growing along one side  - rough up some of the blocks near the bottom by mixing in slabs and stairs to the full blocks! It gives it a little bit of a weathered-down look that can really represent the age :D  - Dotting some leaf blocks and bushes around always adds a little lush greenery, along with mossy cobble, stone-button pebbles and cobble into the floor  - You can make the place feel more alive and lived in by mixing in coarse dirt near the house where you think the ground would be trodden down!  - Watching gem build a couple custom trees in the area would also add a mix of framing the house as well as a cosy wrap-around to it, which can help draw attention to the house as a "main centerpiece" but also give it some shelter, which is generally where people prefer to build their own builds in the wild (irl). It's nice to have natural structures blocking the elements so you dont feel cold drafts blowing through your house on winter nights....
I just want to say, I'm 17 and I knew the song about the pickaxe
Great first episode Impulse!! So much excitement for the season to come!! :D
A solid 40 minutes of "BEHIND YOU GEM"
You can combine your pickaxes’s enchantments using an anvil.
Impulse & Gem are so funny together. They make a great team.
Wow,  Impulse your making up for hard-core with ALL the deaths!
Impulse makes another pickaxe for enchanting. Me: umm you know that grindstones exist right.
YOOO FINALLY I FEEL HAPPY
Literally grinning, smiling and laughing at the first 10 minutes. Happy to see S9!!!!!! So excited to see you all again!! I was laughing so hard at you always looking out for Gem's back XD  You, Gem and Pearl is an exciting trio to look out for this season! seriously so exciting!! <3 was half expecting Cleo to join in your village too but oh well XD --- edit: OH OHH And bdubs??? hell yeaaaahhhh wait also Tango???  how near are all of you? XDDD omgg  -- edit 2: IMPULSE!! YOUR STARTER BASE!! It's so amazing!!!!!! WHATTT
Ok, Impulse just leaked that Hermitcraft season 9 will have 100ep + on the title. Episode 001
So hyped for this
EVERYBODY ITS HAPPENING
Gem is like creeper catnip lol. Except creepers don't like cats, uhh  Anyway this was a lot of fun! Your starter base looks awesome! Mossy cobble and amethyst look great together. Good luck with the new season!
Love the starter base Impulse! So much details!!!
Rather than using a trapdoor in the lecturn corner, maybe there is a more decorative block we can come up with that will fit with the theme of the build. Hmmmm
I like how impulse being a like a dad  to protect gem Everytime that their is a mob showing up
Wrl... Iskall kinda ruined the fun cuz he revealed that it starts today But still i've got a huge smile on my face i believe i can just foot all the way to mars a couple of times on this smile
So excited for the new season! 😁
Damn im to old but Im excited as a kid .. clapping my hands and everything ..EXCITED
Impulse showing his age. Great video.
''OH BUT BEHIND YOU GEM!'' should be put on a shirt
Exploring is fun
I loved this.
Is it someone in creative at 32:16?
how did i not know you could make amethyst blocks out of shards , that makes so much sense and i had no idea    so excited for this season
You tried Impulse, you tried.  But don't worry, I'm sure there are plenty in the comments who didn't know the song either.
But... no Etho?
I'm only 11 minutes in and can I just say you hanging out with the girls and constantly saving Gem is the cutest thing! Edit: Okay I've watched the whole video now. You radiated so much Dad energy in this episode working with Gem, adorable! ImpulseSV= Wholesome Content King!!
HERMIT CRAFT IS BACK  POG pog pog POG pog pog POG pog pog POG
32:16 is that a flying moon?????? Conspiracy or ping?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
2:06, I love how Scar already died to fall damage!
Well I know what the new shirt going to say…
My second season of watching Hermitcraft, let’s go!
Stunning starter base. So happy for season 9
Isn’t it impulse’s birthday in a few days?  (Happy Birthday)
YAY! Hermitcraft!
Your starter base is AMAZING!! I am so proud of you imp!
Anyone know what mod they’re using to be able to only display coordinates at the top? Shown when impulse finds the geode.
Woo season 9 hype!!!!!
POOR IMPULSE! I know that song. And I'm gen z!
Gem is great!!!!!
39:29 Video also Video? :D lol
Use a grindstone whislt enchanting to remove bad enchants
HERMITCRAFT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
wooooooooooohooooooooooooooo
I feel like every time I make a nether portal unless I’ve already been to the nether and it’s planned then it goes into a basalt deltas biome
I forgot how many hermits there are
25:38 fortune 4
Epic!
Tune in next week for another exciting episode of "BEHIND YOU GEM!!!", LOL! So happy Hermitcraft is back.
Alanis Morissettes dad worked at my school, and she would sing for us periodically
i'm glad i picked you as my first season 9 video.  that was definitely fun :) ps: also damn that's an elegant starter base, nice
Gotta say i loved the previous outro 🥺
This starter base looks awesome!
YESS!  HERMITCRAFT IS BACK!!!!! FINALLY!
Try putting a tall plant or bush on the exposed lectern. Or use chairs surrounding a campfire for covering the lectern.
40 mins will be a good length for these s9 episodes
14:24 now see off camera I would have changed the sign to gems hole
Big bag 💼 of NOPE has gotta Be one of the funniest things I’ve heard on hermitcraft 😂 😂
pure greatness: Marvel+Pasta one night s9 the next day
Glad HC is back. So much fun!!  now there is sooo much to watch with all the Hermits!! lol  Thanks for being awesome
Impulse gets all the bitches
Drowned farm for copper?
Amazing! Finally the new season has arrived. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK IMPULSE! 🤜
25:40 he said fortune 4
yoooooooooooooo
I’m so EXCITED!!!!
Yay, hermitcraft is back :))
its funny how he almost passes out because he was laughing and scared at the same time
Buffpulse really did join Hermitcraft.
I feel like impulse is like gem babysitter XD
As soon as I saw everyone together I just got filled with so much love and excitement I didn’t realise how much I loved Hermitcraft I’m so glad to have you all back!
Ayo! Count on impulse to be the earliest of all the hermits I'm subbed to
Maybe a barrel on the corner with the lectern?
Is grian going to be in season 9?
Wwwoooooo!!!!!
2:07 just a few seconds ago they were talking about a little community, and already there's murders and deaths.
In my head all the hermits are hugging every time they say hi the first time.
Corner Railing: Composter with trapdoor on top
Impulse's got all the girls
I SO love the Tudor half-timber style house.
GEM BEHIND YOU! is gonna be a song by elybeatmaker, no doubt
LES GOOOO HERMIT CRAFT S9!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally!!!!
little composter with a smol tree for the lectern corner maybe? :)
Doc and Ren had to bend the rules of the server and specifically create a right time spawner, Gem just makes a hole in the ground and finds two.
I swear on my life that the nether spawn is the same that I had on a single player world before
Honestly I think the long break made me appreciate the first episode so much more, I have been smiling through this whole episode
Love how you and Tango were building at the same time
Wow S9 is starting on my birthday. What a gift.
We got a long season, u see the "001" i think it means there will be more than 200 eps.
Can "Behind you Gem!  Why is this a thing?" become a shirt?
YESSSSS! The season I have been waiting for
Impulse has a harem now
Can we call spawn town "Birchfield?"
Expecting over 100 episodes I see.
I am so excited for this season, can't wait for more episodes! ❤️
This time I might watch inpaulse than grian
Damn this is like watching a panto pmsl
Finally!
In the corner, to cover the lecterns, you could put a composter with little custom tree growing out of it. Just a thought!
Saturn looks a lot like a normal Minecraft world!
Such a cool started base, love the amethyst roof ❤️
Do you know how many times you died in the Mansion? Just wondering
I needed this. I did not realize how much I needed this.
Is Etho not gonna be joking this season?
Also, Gem was my 2nd watch right before this and I was just as sad as you that she didn't clock your Alanis Morrissette reference.
This may be a little bit expensive, but a solution i can see for the trapdoor corners is by making item frames with map art.  It's a bit later-game of a project, but it would fix the issue.
i have been watching vods for weeks just to get my impy fix, i am SO GLAD i woke up to immediately be greeted with an upload! super stoke for this season xx <3
I LOVE THE NEW SKINS
Dude turn off smart leaves! sry too early to speak that
37:00 put a barrel instead of Trapdoor on the inside corners.   Add a fence post and lantern on top of it.
You can place a crafting table or some block there to cover the lectern
This is exactly what I needed today. :)
whats this, impulse became new scar?
Season 8: Gem is Great.  Season 9: Gem behind you!
Let's goooo
Couldn’t imagine a more perfect first episode. This was amazing
That was the funniest start I think I have ever seen. "Behind you Gem"
Watching in the order they pop up in search for me. You're number 3 for me, Impulse! Getting serious Season 3 vibes so far!
YESSS
So used to seeing impulse not die in hardcore that every death in the mansion was like a punch to the gut. It hurt watching haha
S8 Gem is great S9 Gem Is Greater S10 GEM IS GREATEST
YEYY SEASON 9
oh no not the pearl door
impulse and his harem
Love how it’s impulse and then 3 girls 😂😂 love this bunch tho
Its like ur baby sitting gem HAHAHHAHAH
So glad hermitcraft is back.. Impulse after building that starter base you can't say you aren't a builder.. love it
Hey Impulse, loved the first episode! For the lectern covering issue, maybe you could place some sort of block as like a cornerstone kinda thing to cover it up :) Can’t wait for episode 2!
This would take me a month
2 geodes next to each other? You can turn that into a farm of sorts right?
"We haven't been very successful with finding diamonds today" Says the man who found two veins of diamonds in front of the person who spent a long time in vain to obtain those diamonds.
Gem needs to turn on subtitles
You could make and afk water loop to activate both of the spawners
Sounding like Quagmire from family guy
This is going to be another great season. Hope you guys enjoyed your long break <3
This has been the most fun start of a season. Love the direction of the season.
Who’s the new member?
You know it's going to be a long season when there are 2 zeroes before the 1 on the title
This is an amazing 1st episode! The base looks great! I’m going to watch the extended cut for more adventure because.. Exploring is fun! 😄💯
Hardcore Impulse: Can't make plans. HermitCraft Impulse: Makes plans, but can't use them.
So many great lols!  I can already tell this season will be the "getaway" my brain needs.  Thanks for doing what you do!
Finally after rewatching all of your episodes x 100 I can finally watch new episodes that I'm not spoiled in hahah 😆
I've really been enjoying your hard mode world. It's great to see you hanging out with the Hermits again too. As for the lectern in the corner, maybe a composter with bushes on top - like a little tree?
Did anyone else make a bag of popcorn to watch the first episode
You missed a diamond
Soooo... how about making the woodland mansion the community starter base?
on the corner put flower pot with cauldron and leaf blocks
Impluse's timelapse music never fails to make me smile amazing video, really excited for this series!
IT - HAS - BEGUN !!!
YESSSSS HERMITCRAFT
YES!!!
YESSS
you should use glowlichen for the signs on bouble elevator
Instead of the title "a wild new beginning" you shoulda put "LOOK BEHIND YOU GEM!" 😂😂
Season 9 hype 😁
you need to enchant one pic and if it is not right enchant books
Already
HERMITCRAFT!
There’s gonna be 100+ episodes. Lemme explain:   This video is episode 001.  Last season was 01. THERE WERE 35 EPISODES!
I'm so happy Hermitcraft is back, love the build Impulse!
THIS HAS MADE MY DAY THE NEW SEASON IS OUT YAYYYYYY
I haven't laughed so much like this in a long time my abs hurt from laughing so much
Impulse saying IronTic instead of Ironic is hilarious! Great start to what will be an amazing season.
Add powdersnow to the spawner so the skeletons drop arrows and slow arrows
Last season was "Gem is great" and this season is "Gem behind you!" which is amazing 😂
I wish I could like this 100 times
Moon Bye
Omg it’s happening. Everyone calms down. But it’s happening nt
YO I FORGOT ABOUT THIS!
The sequel to "LOOK OUT PHIL!"- "BEHIND YOU GEM!"
I was hoping for a new hermit or two, but i'm still happy even if it didn"t happen. Have an amazing season Impulse!
Imp or sImp
We have got to talk about scars outfit
Ender Man FARM TOMORROW OKA @IMPULSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT
A lot of hermitcrafters speedbuilding at the same time in the video.
So glad you all are back, I've had a really hard time finding enough content to fill the void you guys left 😅🤣
IMPULSE!! that's not a starter base! That's hugeeee!! Wow! It's bigger than anything I've ever built! Looks awesome, so glad hermitcraft is back
I screamed so loud when I saw this I woke up my sister
It's back!!!!!
hey excited to see hermit craft season 9
sticl a barial or a crafting table in the cornor
Finally, my life has meaning again...
All that time in a hardcore world and you die first day when hermitcraft starts back up lol :P
I will miss botem, but this crew is gonna be so fun! Gotta name this crew!
LETSSS GOOOOO IT FEELS GOOD TO BE BACK. MY WEEKEND IS SORTED!
I didn't know I'd be this happy about Hermitcraft season 9 but I'm positively GIDDY!!!!!
Impulse harem.
I how this season is a bit more about the building and stuff and less of the roleplay like s8
SEASON 9 YUSSSSSSSS
lucky impulse, surrounded by all the ladies!
Aaaand~ here. We. Go.
finally
is it possible to get the seed , me and my kids would like to play along, and its a bit more fun when it is on the same seed
You could try to use a banner to cover the lectern
Good days boy , its finally back :D
Impulse grind stone exist to remove enchants
well great! def should look up for more alanis morissette
Little harem eh impulse?
I want “behind you gem” merch
I swear that was the fastest 39:43 of my life
THANKS FOR A GREAT START TO SEASON 9
i miss the torch spam
Ladies man impulse
Let’s just appreciate the little details Impulse put into this starter house! It’s so cute, you have improved so much with your building Impulse!
That starter house is dang gorgeous, what a nice take on a style that's used a lot. Also, everything Bdubs does makes me smile, that hollering down the water drop cracked me up. He hasn't uploaded yet but the sneak peek of his City 17 looking tower in the background is amazing too. Builds are already stepping up from previous seasons and it just started!!
To coverup the lectern in the corner you can always just add a block with a decoration (flower pot,etc) or storage barrel or something
I love how unafraid of bold color palettes you've become. That base looks so pretty!!!
Yearrrrrr Hermetcraft 9
I saw a theory video putting together y'all's code and couldn't believe it. Best unintentional birthday present!
At this point, I think 1.19 should be a redwood forest update, with massive redwoods and tree villages
We're proud of all of you!!   also this chaotic group quickly becomes my favorite of this season
so many spoilers :(
YOOOOO HERMITCRAFT SEASON 9 GO BRRRRRRRRR
Shut up and take my likes!
Hey impluse here is an idea.  What if you make 1 book and quil and put it in yoir base and almost ever episode you write the interesting things that happen in a really dramatic way and at the end of the season we can go through it.  It would be great to see this 😀👍
OMG love the build....  are you becoming Buildpulse?
Yayyyyy
That wasn't a door. It's a doorn't, as in doorn't go in there.😄
Maybe use barrels as the corner by the lecterns?
HUH??????
Impulse you played so match hardcore recently  that's why you were like that XD
Great combo
Noooo etho!
1:00 Looks like there is no new member this season...
Loving the idea of the hermits living next together ❤️
guys..is this real?...im having trouble believing..
You were right about your cheeks hurting! Awesome first episode.
So hyped for this season! For the corner of the patio you could put a small corner bench made of stairs to hide the lecturn.
Centralized shoping district?
Make the videos as long as possible 😭 we don't mind
This is gonna be great
Everyone starts with nothing, WEAK. Impulse and the girls: Casually taking down a Woodland Mansion with stone tools.
I'm so excited for season 9. But are you sure you don't need buttons with your starter base
Should definitely make some merch from “behind you gem!”
Whats the name of the timelapse song?
20:54 I was full-on expecting Impulse to say the slogan!
Lets Gooooooooo
the amethyst roof is an interesting choice but the house looks super cute!
Unofficial video title: Behind you, Gem!
You and Gem make a great duo!
Villagers: "AHAHAHAH WE CANT BELIEVE THEY LEFT US" Me: "element animation did a relly good job animating ngl"
The starter base looks absolutely amazing! So excited for the next episodes <3
Impulse coming in clutch with all the boat traps he's done in Hardcore!
Nice!
Welcome to Season 9 Impulse! You ARE a BUILDER!! I'm glad that you get to do fun things with Gem and BDubs this time. You got to enjoy Pearl last season. I can't wait to see many more colabs! For Monday's stream please tell us how many times you died! LOL I bet it felt good to be able to die and keep working at the Mansion! LOL Super Excited!
AAAAH I LOVE THIS SO MUCH HERMITCRAFT IS BACK
I can show you the world …. Splat
🎶I will show you the world🎶…..splat😂
did you forget about the grindstone
GEM BEHIND YOU!!!!
impuls got all ze girls xD
What texture pack do u use for it to make items small when there damaged
I miss boatem😭
TFC is in the first episode? Lesgooooo
In true Hermitcraft fashion, "Behind you Gem!" is now memeable
I saw the thumbnail and actually screamed
Community 🤝 Busted FPS  Get ready people. Hermitcraft S9!
EVERYBODY STAY CALM...  IT'S HAPPENING!
I’m loving the chemistry between this group! Cleo, Gem, Pearl and Impulse bounce off each other so well lol
FINALLY!!!!
SEASON NINE LETS GO!!
Your starter base is fantastic and almost has a tudor vibe to it! Loving the new season so far. Since you found a double amethyst cluster, you could sell amethyst shards because people would need crystal blocks and tinted glass for mob farms etc. Maybe you can also make a slime farm asap to get the monopoly on slime.
GeminiTay is everywhere i luv it ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✨✨
Oh that’s right!!! This is going to be your first full season as a full time YouTuber! Congrats man!
the long awaited Hermitcraft Season 9!!! Gonna binge watch all hermits videos
Love that the hermits are back at it. Maybe use a composter with leaves on it in the corners as a planter box to hide the lecterns? 😁
I decided to open youtube, jokingly thinking that maybe hermitcraft is back. then behold! the first video in my recommended
I've been waiting for this day for what seems forever :D
woo hoo lets gooo! new season start
I think your starter base would look good with a windmill
best part: BEHIND U GEM
Been following Hermitcraft since season 7 and impulse has been my favourite hermit always and I appreciate all the hardwork you put in to create this amazing and sick content.
YESSSSSS!!!!!!
The new 1.18 terrains and hermitcraft S9 gave Hermitcraft S3 vibes where the terrains are amplified
Can't wait for more episodes :D
I’m pretty sure that if you put a scaffold at the top of the elevator you will pass through it and won’t be bouncing on water
YEEEEES
Impulse: "Oh no I accidentally crafted boats"  *Old habits die hard*
Let's goooo
seed?
ITS HERE LETS GOO
HERMITCRFT
Can't wait to see the incredible things you and all the hermits will do this season, much love Impulse!
Alternative title: Impulse SV simping for 11:59 minutes
The chaotic group I never thought I needed
Why does no one ever use the gold tool trick for enchanting anymore? Still works.
We all have to respect the colour PURPLE!!!!
"BEhind you Gem!' - impulseSV 2022
Yayyy I missed hermitcraft good to see you guys back again!!!♥️
SEASON 9 IS TOMMOROW
Look at impulse! Taking care of the baddies when the ladies all ran away entering the mansion. What a gentleman! 😂👍
:( no new members
Bdubs screamed so hard it made Xisuma leave :D
Some variety content other than Mc would be cool to go along with the new season
you could put a boosh in the corner - like a cauldron with some leaves on top or sth like it
2022 is the year Impulse doesn't stop finding woodland mansions on accident
Starter base looks so awesome! Trust you to find and conquer a mansion on day 1 :')
Lets gooooooooooooooo!!!! Season 9!!!!
Did anybody spot etho? I miss etho
It is back! The waiting was soooo worth it! Love the base! Love the neighborhood. Just great content
All mobs of 1.18 have heard that "Gem is Great" so they are following her everywhere.
Plz make videos more than 30 min we love this video... And we expect that we will get long videos further...
I AM SO UNBELIEVABLY HAPPY
Wow everything’s looking so cool already! I love your starter base, it looks so homely :D I love that you’re settling with Pearl again and with Gem. You and Pearl had such a great dynamic last season, as did Pearl and Gem, and I’m excited to see more of you and Gem hanging out too
I feel like "BEHIND YOU GEM" is going to be the new "Gem is great".
LETS GOOOO
New hermitcraft season on my birthday? Finally (:
Damn boatem gang were just waiting in the void for the creation of world
Season IX…. YESSSSS
13:18 "Exploring is Fun!" Now available in HC S9
Aaahhh......this season had a picture perfect sta-BEHIND YOU GEM!!!

YYYAAASSSSSD
Excited
Poor villagers
love all the interactions , esp with gem lmao with all the 'behind u gem'
Yesssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!
Great video! Love you working with the other hermits (good mix you three)! Also beautiful base. As for the corner, put a pillar or flower pot or statue on the inner corner. You could also use picture frames.
You could put powdered snow and cobwebs into the skeleton farm to produce strays which have a bigger loot table.
Awesome house! Love it!
It's finally here!!!!!!!!!
I already love this season😂🤣
so excited for this season!!
Unexpected but welcomed 👀
behind you gem!
I was today years old when I realized “isn’t it Iron Pick” was a play on Isn’t it Ironic… and I call myself an Alanis Morissette fan…
Gempulse for the win!
At last, the long wait is over
Finnaly
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YAYYYYYYYYY
so far with all the first episodes i've watched (being 2) i smiled so big when all the hermits were running around at spawn, seeing all my favorite creators  edit: I just noticed scar's skin its beautiful
Awesome!!! How many times did you die?
12:08 this isn't 3rd life 🤣
Mine cart AFK loop
NO WAYYY ITS HERE!!
saw this instantly clicked
And here I thought you were doing bo burham's ironic song when I watched gems vid
Do u use litematica to build? I am just curios to know if you guys use that!
i think gem has feromon for mob, i already watch gem video but dont hear or see what i see here... thatrs make fun to watch u all friend...
We gotta get the gang back together
Thought it is the finale at season 8
Algorithm
Wooo! I wasn't expecting S9 so soon! 🖤 LET'S GO!!!!
will you make a mega base????
BEHIND YOU GEM!
In my opinion the cobble and amethyst blocks don’t look good. I would change cobble  that for purple or menganta concrete powder!.
I loved this episode, it was so much fun and the roof on your starter base is amazing 🤩
Where did your two totems go?
WOW, it really is a wild beginning!
you should collab with Gem, Pearl, and Cleo more often. you guys are hilarious together!   ...especially Gem
Yo Impulse! Love the episode! On your geodes: IlMango actually published a video on how to make an automatic farm with flying machines that is not completely messy! Maybe if you need an idea for another shop, you might wanna give it a watch ;)
I am 11 years old.
LETSS GOOOOOOOOO
Hhhyyyyyppppeeeew
Great start to a long awaited new season 😂 glhf!
So excited!!
Etho????
18:00
you, pearl, cleo and gem are so funny together, hoping for more interactions!!
All of ely's theories has led up to this moment
I'm 5 minutes in and I've only just realised that the back of Gem's head looks like Keralis' face.
For the Corner Just use a Inverter Spruce stair
“Behind you Gem!” Lol
Impulse I never get good enchants
I was waiting sòooooo long let's go
You could put a composter in the corner where the lectern is in the open
I was like : We'll se how much time impulse will survive compared to his Hardcord World Me 5 minutes in the video : Huh
bite-sized episode? This, good sir, is a hearty meal, and a good one at that!
I have not laughed this hard in a long time, Impulse... Oh my word LOL. That Mansion Mission was just awesome! Thanks for that bud :)
The commentary from you is hilarious Impy! You can really tell you guys are just as excited as all of us. Loving it!!
So worth the wait!
LEZGOOOO  Tbh Really Shocked And HAPPI Seein' u Uploaded First  No Toleration  Just Absolute Happiness Knowing That U'll Be Uploadin' Like Mega  Esspecially After Hearing U Doin' YT Full Time Job <3 Sendin' Hugs Luv U Impulse
Impluse you are great. Enough said. Season 9 will be great. Thank you for being ImpluseSV  the great and your great videos. Have a great day.

impulse and the grails LOL
Loved it
Love the video
What is his death tally
It’s coming…
YESSSSS!!! S9!!!!
You could turj the zombie one into one of the social spawning drowned farms if you get a bit more resources to get a better source of exp and an early copper income
ITS FINALLY HERE
HERMITCRAFT?!
The fact that there are two zeros before the one suggests that the episode count might be in the triple digits :D
im obsessed with their dynamic omg
Impulse is really improving as a builder! :)
I dont really see gem much cuz i watch your POV but it is cool to see more of her
FINALLY!!
BEHIND YOU GEM!!  Needs to be a T Shirt

I’m happy
Impulse hanging out with the ladies I see 😏
alternative title:  Hermitcraft: Behind You, Gem
Yayyy! This was perfect to wake up to!
As they breached the woodland mansion, all I could think was "Don't worry, you're in the company of a guy who's been hardened by 24 seasons of naked and scar- and he's dead..."
AHHH, it’s happening. Everybody stay calm,  it’s happening!!!!!
SEASON 9 LETS GOOOOO

Two T-shirt ideas: 1: behind you gem 2: will stop for coal

"Behind you, Gem!" I sense this is going to become a thing this season, at least I hope so. LOL

Did TFC leave?
Gem the magnet of mobs
Heck yeah! Season nine!
Communism hurrrrray
I stayed up past my bedtime for this🤫
YES YES YES :D  I wonder if anyone else has uploaded their videos, I’ll go check that now so I know what I’m gonna watch after this I’m glad they’re starting on a blind seed, hope this is done for the next season  Right now this season is just primordial soup I have no idea who is gonna be friends and who is gonna be enemies, I don’t know what the teams are or what will be built and I’m ready to see what universe is born
The first one
*Watches happily while wishing to join in the shenanigans lol*
You can send up a bubble elevator from the skeleton spawner and make them come up to your house Edit : im not sure if the spawner will still work because it will get very far away and it probably won't load
So hyped for season 9!!!!

Yes! Season 9! More Impulse content is the best!

Hi Impulse   If you get yourself some powdered snow and put it at head level in the spawner down shoot the skellys will turn them into strays and the loot table is better than a normal skelly spawner.
