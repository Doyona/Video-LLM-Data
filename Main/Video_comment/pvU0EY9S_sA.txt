POKEMAN
Make a grading video for this video🙏 easy views😂
Are you a forest fan mate?
Only little kids would think this is cool and valuable 😂
i got a signeture and a 14/15 from my one box
How the hell are these guys selling trading cards now, you people will buy anything. There’s literally no appeal to buy these, why would you want them
No one cares about these cards
This is so sad 😂 sidemen cards pmsl what's the world come to
Upload on Randolph Pokémon. Cheers.
I’ve got a miniminter 4/5 red parallel, what do we thats worth?
My advice to you randy is you should get Simon jj and Harry just to sign the ones without the signatures on. Lol
This is just dumb I'm sorry
Start running you nicokardo avakardo
So when do we get a "Grading Sidemen Cards" video? Lol
Sidemen TCG 🗑️
Petition for randy to make a sidemen card binder video
Hey Randy you’re rapidly becoming one of my favorite YouTubers
My regret was not buying more of them😂
Be interesting to see if Harry’s have any substance on them!
How does it work?
Where can I buy the packs from????
wow these are trash lol
Your batch of cards was dead chip and calfreezy got better cards
This video is sad on so many levels lmao.
“The cards backwards, but it’s okay you can just move it” okay randy I thought you weren’t allowed to 😂
Waiting for Sir Theodore card
Cards are pretty underwhelming - VOL 2 has loads of potential though
Crap.
This is genuinely so ridiculous. I guess I can't knock it too hard. Get your bag I guess.
Who valued it at 10k lmao? You?
While these boxes are cool, it's quite sad that the golden card was pulled before even half the orders went out. 😢
1:46 wtf central cee bar
The thumbnail looks like randy is holding a knife on his neck.

Simon shirt is sick
these cards are sick
What I don't understand is why ACE would grade these before Yu-Gi-Oh cards? (Maybe these are the size as Pokémon cards?and Yu-Gi-Oh cards also require different grading techniques/experts?)  Surly you'd get more business if you do another franchise. Or is it just because mate rates getting this more popular?
Great video
I wish when they were marketing these they said they would contain rare numbered cards, If they did say it I totally missed it, because I bought two boxes just because im a fan but if i knew they would have super rare cards I would have bought 10
What a waste of plastic
I just got my cards in the United States and I got the autographed ksi glifched card. I wanted to send it to ace but it doesn’t seem they do the United States :(
Wtf are these cards fam? 😂
The only cards I'd never purchase
simon fav number #156 catch him in the northolt trenches loool
pack openings of any kind are mad timeless 🔥
People Actually falling for this Scam?
do more plss
Can you pls open some of the my Hero acedemia cards. They looked cool. Never watched the show. Jsut saw ludwig open them sponsored
These are cringe af
Randolph can you put them in a binder why collecting pls
I haven’t received mine 🫠, can you tell Sidemen to ship mines 😭
Whobuy this g shit? Fanboy
yeah going to go and buy these
The idea of the trading cards was good. Numbered, signed, the golden ticket, limited edition items, its a great idea... But the execution of this has been awful. Still waiting for boxes, but i know that the golden ticket has been pulled. People getting all the hits, and so many still waiting for theirs... Ill be better off selling mine when they arrive. Great idea for having some memorable signed items, but the way it has been handled has been awful
sorry can someone please explain what the point of these cards are? not trying to be disrespectful just wondering if i've missed something
Randolph and Simon now co-own Tobi. 0_0
0:52 Thanks for the advice Randy. I was wondering how to see my cards the right way round. This really helped a lot.
i got glitch 3-5 five simon
Ofcourse he does a  video involving Sidemen stuff which he got for free ofcourse. Cash grab cards.
randy mate, try making some actual good content with some originality if you're feeling like the views are slacking, it ain't the algo, its the wank content
My best pull is the 1 of 49 glitch KSI auto from a regular (non guaranteed auto box). I put it on his Reddit and got 10 upvotes looool
The golden ticket has been pulled. The guy who pulled it posted on Reddit
Ordered this to get to the USA and it hasnt came yet😭
I got a 17/49 and I can’t find one online
I got a 17/49 and I can’t find one online
2:14 randy sounds like yung filly
Flop
Rather buy pokemon cards
I like turtles.....
The fact that there is not an auto in every box is pretty underwhelming
This channel still alive?
Sick man. I got a Vik Submarine  numbered. And got 2 glitches, KSI and Vik. And then rest of the sidemen normal
Love the Sidemen, but Sidemen trading cards seems cringe af...
Clubs?
Mad how he always pulls everyone’s favorite number.
Good video ❤❤
How do u get them??? I really wanna get a pack but idk how to get them.
randy got his own grading company my guy well done lets see what u pull!
lol
does it not defeat the point that the sidemen are just opening their own cards...?
Have you given up on the don life?
Pointless...you can't even "play" with them like most collectable cards...no stats, nothing. Just basically screenshots 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️👎
Can’t wait to see a grading video!
Really like the look of these cards! Simon giving randy a box 🥰
WOW
Wandolph
you meatride sidemen so much lmao...
I give you The money, Just don't Hurt The picture of sidemen! Please!
I think the glitch cards are my favourite they look SICK
Genuine question why would people buy this ? Im not hating im just genuinely wondering since most of them are like screen capture from videos
2:08 Have you guys seen the video of Harry singing a duet with himself as a kid? it’s so cute 🥰 It’s on his channel W2SClips if you want to watch it.
cash grab by the sidemen
