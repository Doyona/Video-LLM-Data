It was nice to see a double retirement lol
Wow
That’s gotta be one of the unluckiest spin out moments in F1 history 💀 right at the very last lap 🤣
engine co-vid
B😮 R-ING!
Fast forward a week later to witness Mercs complete disaster. Lewis not even being able to make it into Q2 and getting schooled by Russell and Bottas LMAOOOOO
Checo for Pope. p.s. Sir Sixteenth
0:53 everyone talking about Red Bull, so are we about to ignore the fact that a BlackSeries AMG GT is the safety car. The normally have a AMG GT, but NOT a BlackSeries. Car looks nice in red.
Now do you want to know what really happened, The fuel pump is provided by the FIA so evreyone has the same gear, the only difference is the shape of the fuel tank, the pick up on the RB car didn't go all the way to the bottom ,hence fuel starvation problems, I work next to an engineering company that does work for RB.
So glad to see RB get their dues, lol
The screwing you get for the screwing you got!!!!! Not an F1 fan but after the theft that occurred at the last race of last season then I hope he suffers as many DNF's and any other problems possible. FIA crooks will surely find a way to help him??
After 4 months of partying, we should have done something with the engine... well, let's see that next year, if you don't mind.
PUTIN'S FAULT?
I loved it because RB did  not finish. No other start of a season could give me so much pleasure.
Hopefully Lewis will win Saudi Arabia Grand prix
Lmao E10 fuel for F1 is a meme. When you factor in all the transport including fans the F1 cars make up about 1% of the emissions. I'd rather go back to V10 and have the FIA offset the minor increase in CO2
Correction : It was neither bullying nor bawdying that made him the Plastic Chumpion. It was good old Michael 'human error' Masi that gifted SLH's 8th WDC to him.
Very happy when Red Bull got double trouble.. Go Mercedes Go....
espionage and sabotage simple lol
RB has lost that Honda reliability...
after  watching drive to survive i kinda hate Red Bull now lol
Last year was a Farce. Hope for Better things this year. Bad Behaviour from the young Drivers is so obvious. Like children some times it just spoils the racing in the end.
Without Honda engine there red bull lose
People from the former GDR are pros at sabotaging fuel and engine fuel pumps ... They told me in pride ...
Drs should not exist. Get back to 1997 rules.
Beating red bull is great because of what happened to LEWIS last season (when you know you did not win!  Pay back is pay back!!!!😘🤔🤔
The absence of Michael Masi
Both ran  out of fuel.  a mystery problem??
Hope they continue to fuck up all season, will be fun to hear all of Horner's whining and excuses.
Really enjoyed the commentary and explanations! Thanks!
i think max is going to make an epic comeback  because he is  SUPER MAX
Since the cars can race so close together they should nerf DRS now its way too OP
Do you think the hubcaps on the redbull's wheels make its brakes hotter than other cars that don't have such hubcaps?
Leclerk... pronounced LE-CLAIR...
😅😅😅😅Good
I think when Max couldn't catch the ferrari he spat his dummy out and it got sucked into the air intake thus causing the breakdown but you can blame e10 if you want. 😂
One word, Karma!
Is it Hard to come back after not scoring any points in first race?
3 Honda's out but still i don't get it Honda would leave F1 but still is in RBR so what about the engine freeze RBR forced because they would leave F1 if that was not given because they have to do their own engine ?? Honda didn't leave so RBR is playing dirty games and nobody notice it ?? Does FIA do anything about that ..... beacause last season nobody could do anything because of that engine freeze (but RBR "found" extra HP so they say)
lulu would have quit F1 under the same problems
Gd for them. I hope Red Bull Boo boys fail miserably this season . Set of scum bags.
That team of Max likes to try to take advantage of a tire change
Alpha Tauri whats up Red Bull is a different car. I watched you when you started. This happened once before
Don t put the verstappencar technics in alpha tauri qause it will cause explosion with fires. please
It was Karma. 😉
Hey, Guys i Hope Red Bull can't get it Right Next's Time😃
When will Christian Horner Try and Blame Mercedes or Hamilton for there Failure Whine Whine Whine
E10 vapour lock... its a known issue when using E10 in cars for many years. Weird how they didn't plan for it considering Japan has got laws in place requiring all cars be able to run on E10 since 2006.
4 Italian cars in the first 10. It's a beautiful thing!!!
Karma caused it😉
What a load of crap excuses. We all seen it we all heard max do nothing but complain, you can try and mask the truth but under the mask is the real face if truth. P.s max is the dirtiest driver not the toughest
All I know is all the orange pumpkin calling people crybabies seen who the real crybaby is
The good news for McLaren after the first race of 2022 is they are equal on points with Redbull. 😋
It's the beginning of karma...
Karma.  They stole the title in 2021 and now their paying for it.   He isn't the f1 wdc.
They tried too hard.
The elephant in the room: Hopefully Ferrari is legal this time... But, to be fair, Leclerc and Sainz are very talented. It should be a great season!
KARMA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hahahaha Red Bull zero point
Another good video guys.  However, you have got to restrain from spoiler titles and images for at least 24 hours. There are many of us who don't get to watch the races live.
Didn’t bother watching the end was quite unfortunate to see the bulls end like that
Baaa haaa haaa haaa rain.  KARMA BABY!
"What caused Red Bull’s 'nightmare' Bahrain GP F1 implosion" ??   ........   .....   KARMA !!!!!!!
Hard to understand  A lot of anoying background noise who is trying to be music To bad we cant see how may thumbs down a video gets but this one has at least 1
I'm Italian and Ferrari supporter, but Verstappen deserved to finish second, he drove a perfect race, however the fact that all Ferrari powered cars go so fast, makes us understand how good the Ferrari Power Unit is, this year we will see some good battles.
I am a firm believer in 'what goes round comes round' and to have Verstappen go home with zero points is nothing less than Schadenfreude. Especially as Red Bull seem to have been so cock sure about themselves they forgot to do the basics like race and low fuel simulations in the two rounds of testing. The REAL and sweet irony though is that his race strategy was stumped by the deployment of a Safety Car! I try to judge people by their actions on a race track but Verstappen puts on such a pick-achoo face (like some very spoilt child) whenever he doesn't get what he thinks is deserved (like everything) just makes me dislike him intensely.
HASS did a great job
E10 sucks , using food for making fuel is the mistake of the century.
It’s just what they deserved having had the rules bent to win the title , nothing more nothing less .
Does anyone know the name of the track that is being used? Sounds amazing!
Ferarri new Red color make it even cooler
I don't get how this is such a problem we use e85 in race cars here in the States. I know the alcohol does affect both egt and iat's but seriously these brainiacs have a tuning problem with e10?
The fuel pump is not the real root cause for Verstappen failure. The issue with stearing wheel can't be related to the fuel pump. So double failure at same time is possible but the real root cause can be different from fuel pump.
let it continue
lol
LeClerk???? stop please
I think Red Bulls year is already over gents.   Will be hard chipping away at ferrari and mercedes in the constructors. Verstappen might be able to take world champion if he's brilliant but even then i think leclerc, hamilton, russell, sainz will steal too many wins from him
Ferrari finally has some consistency.   Thats something they lost for a few years.
Masi would have called out a full safety car and let RedBull get out their spare cars and let them back in position.
RB Nightmare......The Team's EGO......... Recent success is getting to their heads...✍🏿
Big Bulls fan. Hope they'll slow the problem
Karma lol
Karma
As regards braking did not Peter Ustinov have Enzo Ferrari saying in his Grand prix of Gibraltar that any one can stop a car but it takes a genius to make it go fast.
This new fuel, has a lot of problem's, or causes...for engine's. One reason we don't use it in our motor.
Are the cars easier to drive so far? Or just conincidence that 4 team(mates) on parity in the top ten?
Shoddy engineering! They had at least 4 months to get it right and they've made a monumental mess of it. Heads should roll.
I think they both ran out of fuel, the fuel pump is a FIA supplied item from Magneti Marelli, to have both fail given that the rest of the field ran the same leads to the conclusion it was how Red Bull  installed them that was the real problem, maybe they didn't pick up the last of the fuel in the bottom of the tank,  there has to be 1.5 Lts in the tank after the race so a FIA sample can be taken,  both tank level Transducers maybe wrong but as they weigh the fuel into the tanks I think short fuelling the cars would have been spotted.
If Latifi joined with max😜.... No one should defeating.....
It was a tiny touch of karma for the bs that they pulled last year, let's hope it continues
Karma
I had my last laugh. Karma returns - doesn't ever stop. Unfair winning of last year's race goes down the drain for both drivers not finishing in just last 3 laps.
E10 is definitely not greener
Did Haas russian sponsor  pay for the development of this year car?
Max had hot brakes because he overdrove the car. His attempts to overtake LeClerc were amateurish at best, Charles played him using his brain as well as his driving skill. His excuses fool no one, except for a max fans.
HAAS is getting better... Go Go HAAS!!!
I can see this happening this year for RB. Max he’s like a word Champ by Default. Fantastic to see Ferrari in good shape
lot of work for red bull to do in a few days
this soooooooooooooo the remake of cars2
Song? Also, it would be nice to have mention the songs used in the video description.
"earned a reputation as the toughest guy on the grid when it comes to wheel to wheel combat"...IE: the dude is overly aggressive and will just as easily take you out of the race as pass you. This should NEVER be allowed in F1. This is the best drivers in the best cars IN THE WORLD...and that means you don't drive in a manner that endangers others on the track. This dude should be getting black flags over and over again, and lose his Pro Racing License. It is sad they decided to gift him last yrs driver's championship. This guy is what Pro Driver should NOT be.
Surprised to see Red Bull struggled this bad.
I hope it's only with the fuel otherwise if the engine is going to be a big problem and it's only the first race
E10 fuel is an FU to the planet as there is nothing green or sustainable about it.
Nice jobs,thanks share
One word! KARMA
Leclerc is pronounced like Claire. So it sounds like Leclaire.
It's confirmed, Car 2 lore is cannon in real life.
Mercedes will clear there bumping issue. Then we can see good season🤗🤗👌💚
Verstappen’s such a squinny the way he spoke to his team after not being allowed to drive faster after his pit for new tyres.
Max have problem with breaking because of spec ducks, he’s driving style of breaking deep cut in across the Apex at last minute is very hard and breaks that’s why he locked up and The Ferrari regain position some of these things are so obvious and easy to see it’s not funny he’s too reckless in the corners he will take you out every time
Remove that legendary HONDA badge , logo and name  from your car, all hell breaks loose. It's obvious the Honda team isn't involved in the car anymore. They just assembling the engines hence the small HRC tribute. I doubt HRC is involved in the development of the car or the engine. When Honda was directly involved, being the most legendary name in motorsports, they destroyed mercedes and ferrari and all other teams.
Those new cars sound so nuetered.  I wish they'd get back to the screaming loud V10's
Just one win ? what mean ? still more race?see what?
Karma…
Could you please pronounce LeClerc as "LeClair"......not "LeClerk"? You're going to mention him a lot this year so it's good to have the pronunciation right. Thanks :)
1:38 The picture looks like -> Sir Lewis : "Hey Checo, need a drive to the pit?" 😄
I was so happy to see them f::: up . Pore old Horner had nothing to complain about To….. 😎
MAX VERSTAPPEN COMEBACK SOON!
Track ID?
They are better off making that god awful tasting 'beverage' .
All teams use the same Italian fuel pumps that were known to be faulty particularly on E10. Teams like Ferrari and McLaren weeded out the bad fuel pumps before the race. This was common knowledge before and after the race so I don't know why it isn't publicised.
No Masi to help them, I can hear the comments.
I love that merc is dismissed and consigned to a later video. I'm a big George fan and look forward to seeing him trounce Hamilton, and Toto subtly transferring his alliegance whilst hamilton fades. Go ahead George, make my day.
KARMA always strikes back
Honda, they came, conquered and then left. Now Redbull is suffering from reliability issue again..
Red Bull had a proper nightmare there.
Remove the wheel covers…boom…cooling issues gone! Come on FIA, that’s trash bin covers look disgusting on every car…Alfa managed to get them looking a bit better
Greener E10, lol. How much petroleum and coal was used to make the Ethanol ? Useful idiots are in charge.
it's said in such a way as to imply that LeClerc has recently acquired these skills
Dud to the russian aggression on Ukraine the world will be facing food shortage unprecedented in recent years!  Promotion of "bio" fuel in this situation seems to be utterly irresponsible und inhuman!
To finish first, first you have to finish.
Ethanol is not a green fuel. It requires more production of CO2 to get it into your gas tank than just running 100% gas does
two things stood about to me about the Ferrari 1-2 finish. First, Leclerc's sharpness in his battle with Max was very impressive allowing Max to pass so he could get the DRS advantage in the second DRS zone. And secondly, something no one is really talking about, is Ferrari's domination in the pits. They consistently were significantly faster than both Red Bull and Mercedes. Ferraris has never been known for fast pit stops - this changed on Sunday.  Lastly, shout-out to Max and Lewis for both being excellent ambassadors of the sport after a very "un-fun" Sunday.
Maybe max should have kept his real # instead of trying to wear the #1 when we all know it was an empty victory.
Ferrari won just a beginning of the 2022 movie...They won’t last long...Just a little bit opportunity available for Leclerc to tell his bullshit story with media/camera...everybody can win the race but not a talent...
To bad they gave Michael Massie got the boot he could have stopped the race a couple of laps earlier.
I don't like the new cars, maybe they'll grow on me.  I think the V10 era was the best I've watched.
Retribution in the very first race. Still more to Come.
Max great driver car condition not good equals dnf, I'm sure redbull will fix their car til then I'm excited.
Running Ethanol fuel ??? I thought F1 was going green, Ethanol is all around horrible.
Botas stuck with a shity car what a disgrace  he should have just retire!
KARMA
Ethanol  is crap!! Worse  idea ever!
Its time Mercedes  goes to the back!
Kimi could have win!
If the goal was to create closer racing, then they didn’t disappoint
This is just an act of God to punish their stealing last year.
I'm shocked. Verstappen pointed fingers in blame rather than be a good teammate. What a fucking dirt bag. In half a season I went from a Verstappen fan to wanting them to never see the podium again. This was a great race weekend.
Greener ethanol, that is comical as hell, this just proves that Europeans are just as clueless as Americans.
What caused Red Bull’s 'nightmare' Bahrain GP F1 implosion?  Karma.
Ask masi for help
Vers.karma haunting him from last yr  win b.cos of Chris.horner & massi..enjoy a awful season of 2022 Max ...more to follow....anti fans will be praying for more...
AFTER LAST YEARS FORMULA1 SEASON THIS YEARS FORMULA1 2022 L👀KS LIKE A DRESS REHEARSAL.... THE WHOLE OF FORMULA1 IS FAKE... BLAH BLAH BLAH..... CHEATS.... LUCKY IF YOU SEE US WATCH THE HIGHLIGHTS
awesome to see Ferrari on top again though!
schadenfreude it's not the highest human emotion by a long shot, but if every weekend saw Red Bull double dnf, I would laugh and laugh and really enjoy it anyway.
"Red Bull didn't have anything for Ferrari?"  What are you guys smoking? Take away the steering issue and Verstappen still could have won that. Ferrari had the edge on that track, but definitely weren't running away with it either. Sainz was never going to get past Verstappen. The cars are pretty evenly matched.
What goes around comes around Mr.perez
In my opinion:   It's that sponsor { Crowd Strike - We create breaches }
Hamilton is the man, he will always come up on top at the end of the season—too smart and witty for the field. The only way he gets beat is through the intervention of the "institution".
I'm guessing the more aggressive fuel mapping. Mercedes seemed to take a safer route with the mapping with the new fuel. But yea who really knows lol.
Ethanol isn't "green."
Poor choice of words I thought this was about a car crash
Ethanol is not "greener".
Charles's talent was never in doubt if you ask me ...
All 3 retirees are red bull engines
I still believe all 3 engines had a blown gasket, 1 engine seized, 1 lost power first and then got worse and died and An other one Just caught fire :(
kharma
How does a fuel flow issue cause Perez to spin
6 days testing and Redbull did not do a race simulation? Poor management from Horner, and they're paying the price.
Was it a terminal battery problem or a battery terminal problem?
I'm really thinking the RB wasn't simply a fuel supply problem; it seemed much more like electronics were burning up. The difference between Max's slow decline over a few laps with intermittent function at the end, and Perez's tanking within 3 corners ending extremely suddenly with electrical failure, isn't the failure mode I'd expect with failing fuel pumps. With it being 5-10min after a restart, the cars had just enough time to heat up fully...which could be a problem if your restart/race-end mode runs things warmer than the rest of the race. I'm thinking that they're blaming fuel systems as a red herring.
Well i got my wish dutchy did'nt finish the race . phew it was close though . already some pay back for lewis .  Well done lewis 3rd is good .
Looks like a battle between Sainz and Leclerc for the championship. Leclerc will win it since he has a greater command of that Ferrari car. But who knows, Sainz might surprise and put up more of a fight.
Merc will win this season. They have a lot more speed to come from that car with some tweaking and the biggest capability to develop meaningful upgrades. They've focused on building a reliable car that will dominate on about 12 tracks and will finish every race. Red bull and Ferrari have gone for top speed at the cost of reliability and will have a handfull of dnfs this year.
Name of  2  music  are playin video  plzzzzzz  . love   then
It was nice to see fish lips verstappen get his long overdue karma. Spoilt rich kid with a wife beating father and a violent grandfather. He talks like he has peanut butter stuck to his mouth. His bs driving style will not fly this season as he is no longer the underdog so the fans will not put up with him doing dangerous and unfair moves. He is a fake paper champion, everyone knows he has still yet to win a title legit. Also haha to horner that arrogant fop, you went all out for speed and ended up with no reliability.
I wonder what odds I can get on Verstappen not lasting the 7yrs with Red Bull?
I was very happy with it.
I just wondered if both cars overheated.
All eyes are in Ferrari and Mercedes at the moment and very little is spoke about red bull. I think max drove superbly to keep within 5 seconds of leclerc with a problematic car, however I respect and realise that leclerc won this battle!
THE F1 GODS STRUCK RED BULL !!
Scarbs was on Peter Windsor's youtube page and said what happened to the RB and Gasly cars.  Scary thing is that the part that failed was a proprietary FIA component the teams can't change. The control board for the fuel delivery system has a resin coating that was dissolved by the Ethanol in the fuel causing the fuel pump to stop working.   McClaren had the same fault but discovered it before the race began and replaced theirs. I guess RB didn't do as thorough pre race checks. But it could have happened to anyone since ALL the cars have the exact same sealed component in them. Going to be a mad dash to get the design fixed and a new batch delivered before the next race weekend.  Gasly had a non conductive oil coolant they use to cool the motor leak all over the engine which subsequently caught fire.
The red bulls ran out of red bull 😆🤣
Underfuelled cars
Oh dear Max, perhaps that’s what having no integrity causes, what a shame  A well deserved DNF 😢😢😢😢😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😆🤣😆😆🤣😆🤣😆🤣😆 KARMA
Song name?
The Gods !!!
I imagine with Oracle as a main sponsor, Red Bull simply didn't correctly license the engine and only licensed it for up to 56 laps.
No masi to help out red bull....  so no win he he....  The end...
CHRISTIAN HORNER, MAX VERSTAPPEN, RED BULL OWNERS- Your boys took a hellllllllll of a beating. Karma for you manipulation of the final race of last season I guess?
"at that day, 3 bulls retired out of the contest. one exploding into smitherins and the other two suffering a cardiac arrest"
Brilliant to see Ferrari back at the front. Hoping it continues and the win it all!! 🤘🤘
Owner: "I don't want excuses. I want results, or I'll hire someone that will get them."
Toughest aka most entitled and reckless
Hopefully you guys give KMag some props after his performance in the race.
well all i want to say after he was wrongly gifted the last race of the year in 2021 is haha ha, and haha ha some more
Maybe there are bored people with lots of time and resources who make it their business to right wrongs, so they hacked the Red Bull cars, if indeed this is possible
wouldn't be bothered if redbull never got anywhere near the podium again.
Presumably Horner blames Hamilton and Toto?
In my opinion E10 is not a greener fuel, my car for instance delivers 6 mpg less than E5 and I drive a Toyota Hybrid.
Max "*asterisk" Verstappen
I'm going with karma...
Aint  got no gas
It was all that swearing, the cars got embarrassed.
I’m surprised the officials didn’t help Verstapen
Simply lovely.
Poor max and sergio, they really raced well only for their cars to give up on them. Honestly wish them the best and that this problem will be sorted
I still think that this was a fuel issue but it's directly related to the Redbull power train and that's why Gasly caught fire... Just too hot for the old Honda engine.
WHAAATT ???  Not ANOTHER "expert" who MISPRONOUNCES  Leclerc's name LOL   IT is NOT pronounced Le CLERK  - it is pronounced Le Claire -  GEEZ guys get it right will ya? LOL
Just another 21 or so Rbr dnf’s will suit me fine.... 😂
so what ??? dont talk now. holdon.
Lewis's revenge.
I think that Ferrari are playing engine games again. Hass and Alfa suddenly over performing. I smell something off
🏁 GO MAX! 🏁
Karma is a bitch!
The Race might have to do a video for fans.  To explain that RBPT are not building any engines till 2026. Honda are still supplying RB sealed engines, built in Japan till the end of 2025.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha muppets, couldn't have happened to two nicer dorks Horner and Mad Max
Karma is a bitch!
Arrogance caused it. Done.
I've been saying that Leclerc is a better racer than Verstappen since he ran rings round him at Silverstone 2019. I got a lot of hate and vitriol since then, but I'm happy that I was finally vindicated when the world saw Charles once again school Max in Bahrain yesterday.  Max isn't the wunderkid that Red Bull and F1 PR make him out to be - he's just a pretender to the throne. Charles is the real deal.
What happened to red bull? Karma
this is just the beginning of a long list of problems this team has to face this season TRUST
Max screwed up. He forgot his first rule of driving. He forgot to just run into Charles. I fear he may be slipping.
when was the last time we sae 5 Ferrari engined cars in the top 10?
Lol “greener” ethanol. My research tells me otherwise. Maybe I’m wrong, but it definitely has not worked as hoped here in the US.
Fuel system? Sergio’s car ceased up. Not so sure about that one
Forza Ferrari 😍
Sounds more like Karma
Verstappen didn´t deserve his championship last year!
Oh and need to encrypt the team radios.  enough with them having to be on stage with every work while they are competing.
ah so Toto's sugar in their tanks worked! LOL
Dirty e10 for you! If it runs havoc with road cars it's going to with these spaceships on wheels.
Cool seeing leclerc win gj
Max was lucky last season ....but will be unlucky this season
relax it's just the first race and they are RED BULL TEAM.
" It aint got no gas"
Some would say karma
What a heartbreaker.
Great opener to the season! Good close racing, Ferrari back on top, Haas showing great promise and Red Bull having a nightmare, just perfect! lol
What caused Red Bull’s 'nightmare' Bahrain GP F1 implosion ???  Karma.
I would call it Carma
Redbull engine is a rocket i think on lap 27 or so max was 0.9 second behind at beginning of the straight and He Passed him at the end of the straight i never seen that
The people running F1 are always screwing things up when putting these transparent, superficial “eco” measures in place such as the 10% ethanol. That’s really going to compensate for adding more races then is it ?. And the evidence about the environmental negatives of producing ethanol are well known. F1 will never be eco friendly, and these superficial attempts to get headlines about it are so obvious.
Karma. That's what happened
LOL
Karma. They stole Lewis’ 8th title, it’s Karma. Hope they get DNF all season long
Helmut Marko has since admitted that Max was correct about the outlaps
I see the two words that are trending the most today are "Horner" and "karma"
actually im more concerned about mclaren than Redbull problems...
ANY team but Redbull. Trailer trash.
Max eliminated, a gift from God!
without masi being director is the true Red Bull’s 'nightmare'
Verstapen: what is happening? Call Masi now…..
Max looked very Naive this weekend. taking that tight line on the SC restart is literally a comical rookie mistake. not realising after 2 failed attempts that turn 4 was better to pass than 1, getting a 3rd bite of the cherry and still trying to send it at T1 and cooking tires. strange showing. Sounded like a baby in the cockpit in race 1, i thought he was all relaxed now he achieved his dream? Max implosion this year? potentially.
well... karma, right? :)
Does a lack of fuel cause the tires to lock up as they did for Perez ??
Honda sucks
THEY'D BETTER GET THEIR POINTS NOW BEFORE MERCEDES DIALS IN... 😂😂😂
Paper champion speaks
Karma is a bitch..  🤣 🤣
Carma!!
Taking risk with fuel level because the car is heavier than the competition. Maybe...
Its simple ....its called Karma
"what caused red bulls nightmare Bahrain GP implosion?" In a word? Karma.
Nice to see that hollow champion and Horner knocked down a peg or two. The both of them deserve each other. Do feel for Sergio though, at least one gentleman in the team.
I'm surprised Red Bull didn't try to blame Hamilton for both.
No word about the real surprise? Haas went from dead last to best of the rest. That may be a fluke and maybe not as exciting as Ferrari, but is definitely more surprising.
You basically repeated everything that was said during or after the race ....
The main thing I think we saw was wheel locking
Mercedes’ pit stops was so slow no idea why
Absolutely made my weekend seeing the smug look wiped from horners face and listening to max cry 😿😂😂😂
Hopes their solve their problem before next race
I can honestly say I have never enjoyed 3 laps of a Grand Prix so much in my life. Come on Ferrari!
As a Mercedes fan, this was almost as good as when Bottas took out max and checo in Hungary last year. Go merc!!!!
Hoe staat het met de mensen rechten in Bahrein max
What type of music is in the background?
Maybe Seb can go back to Ferrari 😂😂😂😂
Lu Lu Lucked into ANOTHER free podium. He also extended his record breaking streak of races without a Mechanical DNF, now approaching 5yrs.
Interesting race, I was surprised to see Ferrari using a purplely red color, it would be nice to see them have a yellow livery.
So they won’t hold the Russian gp but they will have the Saudi Arabia gp? Interesting 🤨
Red bull and verstapen are jerk
What caused the terrible results of McLaren? :(
I feel sorry for Checo but it is Karma coming back to Christian and Max. They are douchebag a-holes and I love when they're brattiness comes back to bite them. It's hard to the title without the officials help huh Max?
yeah no shit your brakes were overheating. what did you think was going to happen with all those full sends into turn 1?
It's great to see nice clean racing, looking pretty obvious who all the dirty racing was coming from last year
The fact the 3 honda cars retired its surprising that honda may have more relaibility issues
How come RB didn't do any low fuel running? Surely that's important for qualifying simulation? IMHO, seemslike a huge oversight.
F all the green crap. This stuff ruins everything. There is no such thing as clean energy. If the so called experts were right about anything we all be dead and under water by now. Time to bring back fun around the world. The race was fun over all. Curious how the season goes on.
I think I'm going to enjoy these videos as much or more than the actual racing.
Listening to Max on his radio was hilarious, I know he's young but he isn't that young! "I'm never, ever doing that again!!!" How old is he... 7? What a spoiled child!
It started in the last race at the end is the season. And it’s called karma. It’s a bitch.
Red Bull got what they deserved
Love to see it
It was the stolen Mercedes engineers sabotaging the engines. Toto is playing the long game ;)
Redbull without Massi and 🤣🤣🤣👀
We seem to have ignored Magnussen in 5th a brilliant return!
I believe if Masi still Race Director, race will be in 55 lap. We just need 55 lap to motor racing. That's requested from Jonathan.
So happy to see Ferrari back.  RedBull just need Michael Masi.
How is it that not a soul has mentioned that brilliant move by Leclerc on the restart?! The way he bolted around the curve, forcing Max to wait before he could apply throttle, was pure genius. It couldn't have been better placed or timed.
Biggest question: can they follow each other?
It KARMA, More karma to come
Karma is a fucking bitch! The corrupt FIA helped them steal the drivers championship last year.
Most teams did, but Red Bull – with its more compacted programme and the 11th hour performance upgrades to verify – did not. The list of parts changed overnight at Red Bull after qualifying included fuel tank lifter pumps.
At a certain point of temperature the fuel begins vaporise and there will be a vapour lock in the pump, the fuel pressure dives and the pump is briefly pumping fresh air. The sudden load changes as the system pressurises and depressurises (together with the excess heat inside the pump from the vaporising fuel) will tend to damage the pumps and eventually they can no longer feed fuel to the engine.  The E10 fuel introduced this year runs at a higher temperature than the full fossil fuel previously used and so the cavitation threshold has changed. Only those teams with enough preparation time to do full race simulations in testing, including running the tanks almost dry, found this out.
All winter, it’s as if Red Bull has been a few weeks behind Ferrari in preparation. The suspected reason for the sudden loss of power in the Red Bulls late in the race is fuel cavitation – and, if true, that’s almost certainly a function of the team’s ambitiously compressed programme.  Fuel cavitation tends to occur as the last dregs of fuel are being pumped around near-empty tanks. As can be imaged, the fuel is heavily sloshed around because of the loads being fed into the car and no matter how well-designed the tank’s baffling system, the temperature of the fuel increases when this occurs.
Michael Masi. Didn’t fix  it for them :)
Made my day that both Red Bulls ran out of fuel/power 🤣🤣
I wonder how long it will take the FIA to find out how Ferrari are "bending the engine rules" this time. All the Ferrari powered cars are suddenly compeitive. I'm overjoyed to see someone else win. but the scale of Ferrari's improvement is suspicious.
As Alonso once said, "Karma!" 🤣
Good job KMag and Yuki!!!!
Just so they can keep the ink flowing but a disaster would be if RB had 3 bad races. They learned they will keep up with ferrari on certain circuits. Onwards and upwards. The haters are casuals anyway. If Max has a reliable car he is a better driver and more confident then Leclerc. All the pressure is on ferrari.
i think drs usage must change, every driver must be able to use it for a specific amount of time by pressing a button in every lap , not just at specific parts of the track and even if the gap of the driver in front is bigger than 1.5 sec
With RB trying to save face, I suspect that the fuel was only a small contributing factor in RB's thermal runaway..  leaving me reluctant to agree with your assessment of the root cause of RB's failure.  I was able to discern a more dramatic affect in the overall thermal dynamics, based largely on the redesign of the side pods and air intake geometry. Both of which, contributed to the reduction of air flow thru the intercooler and oil cooler, while running the race in a higher engine mode than was advisable, was RB's choice..
Why isn’t this video about Ferraris success? Even if RB didn’t have the problems they were still gonna lose to Ferrari.
KARMA'S A BITCH, let's hope Red bull gets a full dose all season long.
Oh what a shame ! lets hope it happens again. Well done to Hass
it was a decent race for red bull... just 4 laps out of the checker flag it all came down crashing  like wtf!
excuses, excuses, that some call Karma...
Great to see Ferrari back at the front!
Karma is coming back to take those unfair points gained by RB last championship 👍🏻
Did anyone notice, that just before the engine failed Max closed the gap the Charles buy 1/2 sec or more. then it failed. just saying. watch the gap times. anyway, too bad for RB
Typical RBR,  When Helmut M is saying they are on top, then you should be worried. That man should not have a voice in F1. I am a big Max fan as a Dutch person and an cheering for Max, but this is typical again.  When other teams looked into the warning they got about the fual pump RBR did not. And you test without low fuel runs?  Are they brain dead at RBR?   I am afraid it's going to be a Mercedes year again. They are with a horrible car P3 and 4 and will once they solve the issue probably the teeam to beat. RBR will be 3rd team soon i am afraid. I hope not, but it does not look well.   Sloppy and lazy attitude costs them 30 points!
Leclerc is Brilliant with any car
The retirements are called Karma I have 0000000 sympathy for Dead Bull I honest wish there is more to come. Never gloat when you see other teams struggling and talk trash about their cars when your car turns out to be the trash. To finish second or third you first have to finish.
Great post.
So Redbull failed before the race even started...wow.
I'm surprised Horner hasn't lodged a protest of some sort along the lines of "That's not fair".
The fact it's new cars, new systems, new rules I expected more issues, especially with some of what other teams went through and are still going through. That being said with Ferrari given them credit, with their engine issues, they pretty much said "We're stuck with this one so we aren't going to be competitive but when the new cars come in 2022 we'll be better." and after this first race, they were right.   The fact that all the cars this year have had issues, we've seen McClaren have issues that dropped them from the no 4 team. Mercedes dropping from the best team to 3rd best at the moment. This year is going to be a fun and interesting one.
This was nothing but God getting Max Verstappen back. 🤣😂❤
Max does not have a title to defend 🤣 It was mistake 🤣 "Error Error 🤯"
Respect to Charles Leclerc- What a smart driver - In the other hand Max is just a person who can push fast... Just a Moron.
Love the background music.
Couldn't give a hoot for RB!
Red Bulls L0L!
right there where they belong! dnf in all races
Best part of the race? Max retiring. Sorry for Perez though. Yes, I dislike Max and I'm open about it.
I'm a Mercedes fan, and seeing a Ferrari 1-2 is what Formula 1 needed again.  Congrats!!
I was personally amazed at how much of a diva Max was after his championship win. Have they created a monster? His radio was revealing. I also like how he death stares reporters he doesn't like.
This could turn out to be costly at the end of the season lol
I'm not sure you can say the problems of max, Sergio and Pierre are completely unrelated. They're both at the back of the car and could have been triggered by heat. Granted, it appears a different part of the car failed in Pierre's issue, but isn't it still possible that both are related to heat generated in the vicinity of the back of the car?
For me Red Bull fan it was so sad, 2-4 was really good haul of points and then this, it left me devastated inside :(
😂👍🏾Fake champion KARMA!!!
Good to see Ferrari back on top. Congrats to Charles! And I'll be honest,  anyone beating RB is awesome in my book.  But Charles was just too good 👍
For the love Of God... Stop pronouncing the last c in leclerc.... It's "le-clair"
No love fot the HAAS , it seems, The RACE?
Looking forward to hopefully seeing a feelgood Haas video from you guys, since K-Mag is still an absolute boss?
Redbull …Karma ???
So happy. After Horners bullish behaviour last season and in the break, he got what he deserved
5 minutes of talking around the problem and you still havent said it. go listen to last peterwindsor video where scarbs actually explains what happened with the red bull's fuel system
Personally if I was the other teams I would be worried about the Mercs. Their car has a ton of issues and yet was as quick as the second Red Bull and Ferrari. Sure they dropped off badly using teh hard tyre, but that was a tactical call that didn't wok. Question will be how long will it take to settle their rear end, remove the bouncing and the other small issues? I hope it's sooner than later and the fight is 3 way. Would be more exciting.
ANY1 WANNA TALK ABOUT MAX SPITTIN HIS DUMMY OUT OVER TEAM RADIO LOL ABSOLUTE JOKE LOL
How can no fuel make a cars engine lock up? And if a car has no fuel how can it drive 1/2 a lap back to the pits?
Ethanol is not Green!🤣
Funny that:  Max and Charles = close fights no incident   These guys know how to fight, unlike the other guy (yes, we know but shall not be named).
Red bull as lost itz wing man Michael masi
Sabotaje, cuidado hay intervención en sus sistemas, hay un traidor en su equipo, No es coincidencia.
Fuel coking or vaporization?
give 'm all the same car, solved.
It's soooooo good to finally see that Leclerc has a car worthy of his talents and I am equally as happy that Ferrari has proven all the haters wrong.  I believe this is the year that everyone will see clearly just how good Leclerc really is - he may even be better than Verstappen, in terms of the new generation of drivers.
Lets goo Mr Race🔥🔥Hope u had a great weekend. Starting the replay train 🌟😁🌟Incoming Big Flex Like and Happy Monday 😎👍
Poor car/engine management by Verstappen, uses the car as an extension to his privilege generated ego, that sort of attitude has raised it's head every season. I must say his petulance is very entertaining coupled with Horner's cockiness it makes good television.... It doesn't help now the F1 governing body has given him a free championship and an admitted it was an error, it must play with his mind that he needs to win this one outright with no controversy, that may make him push the car too hard...
what a beautiful sight.
Feel bad for Sergio Perez mostly he was doing such a good job on the course he won last year being able to battle even Mercedes
Been watching F1 since the 1985 season, am I the only one who thought the race was crap?  Seriously where was the close racing ? Take DRS out of the equation, where is the close racing ?  I don’t understand all this positivity, within 3 laps all the cars were seriously away from each other, sorry not buying it.
I figured out what e10 stands for!
Really happy for Haas and Gunther. Gunther always reminds me of some medieval 'torturer of the month' but he's such a genuine bloke with a real passion for the sport. Nice to see some success come his way.
Very pleased with the outcome of the race.  Too bad about Red Bull, it was actually a pleasant surprise (LOL)!!! Great results by Haas for KMag.
Very good karma
Red bull got some bad karma. LOL
Seems like Red Bull has a lot of problems to sort out, and they have to do it fast because Ferrari isn't going to wait for them.  It does also looks like Mercedes is around where Red Bull was in 2019, faster than the mid field, but not quite fast enough to keep up with the Top 2 teams. Barring any more crazy unreliability from Red Bull, they have some catching up to do. But the craziest thing for me was Kmag and Haas, there wasn't really a point in the race where it felt like Kmag was in danger of not scoring points, he was pretty safely sitting in the Top 10. Who knows, if they can get a few good upgrades, maybe they can get to a safe upper midfield spot and aim at a couple podiums this season if there are any crazy races.
Did I see Masi lurking in the RB garage, probably apologising that he is no longer able to 'fix' the race for them anymore!
FYI: E10 is not green in any way. It merely corrodes the fuel system and absorbs water. As a result new cars will have a shorter life and lead to greater pollution. E10 is a way to reduce the apparent efficiency of ICE to make electric look good after recent comprehensive studies show the current crop of EV's are substantially worse for the environment over their life.
Basically, literally everything went wrong with RB18 for various reasons. Shame for Red Bull, hopefully will bounce back strong in Saudi
This is why you don't buy an ECU from McLaren.
Totally here for RBPT having only enough reliability for 295km...
Max  cannot  be  in  merc he bashes  the team  wayyy  tooo  often
Baby max can't whine now
When  I  saw  Gasley  catch  fire  I Knew something was gonna  happen   they  have  Honda and  redbull  parts  in them. And it did  happen
Karma is a bitch....
Yes yes Ferrari did a 1-2 and red bull got fucked, BUT KEVIN JUST PUT HAAS IN 5th!!!!!!!!!
this e10 fuel is garbage, as a vw tech we have cars in on a daily basis with problems caused by e10
I just want to say that Scott Mitchell's question to Lewis in the post race conference was bullshit to be honest. What did you expect him to say? Shitty journalism at its finest.    "karma for Abu Dhabi".. How is what happened Red Bull's fault you twat? That incident was on the fault of the FIA.
Funny listening to Max and  Perez ran his mouth "Nice Engine" over the same power unit that brought them success last season
A fantastic start to the season! Let's hope it continues and that we get a legitimate world champion this year!
The E10 fuel is absolute garbage. I dont even put it in my road car. It doesn't have the power delivery and can damage parts.
He didn't fail to keep up with leclerc he was able. You're negatively biased.
Karma's a bitch!
the GREAT PRETENDERS.
Ferrari took pole, fastest lap and a 1-2 podium after many years yet your video is all about RB. You lost my sub. Cheers
Now we know why you didn't go full beans in practice!
🤣🤣🤣..Thank you Karma.
Funny how the last few laps can sh1t on your race, eh Max TearsTappen.  I'm sure his engineer repeatedly said there was no sensor/telemetry data suggesting technical problems.
Karma.. She is a biaa
The gods noticed that humans was manipulating F1 to one teams gain so decided to put it straight in the first race.
I think it will be the best season we have seen in well, forever, if Hamilton gets a car that isn't over 1 second off the pace. Then you'll have 3 teams scrapping for wins and podiums. I can't wait.....
Gutted for RB, so unlucky for Max and Checo
Is it a blip or an indication that RB has bitten off more than it can chew going in house
Well Max at the end of the day that's racing, some things happen that just shouldn't happen. It's ironic that came out of your mouth out of everyone affected!
Could be worse... McLaren
remember the last time Red Bull use no.1 on their car before Verstappen?and i hope you'll do a video about Mercedes customer teams and what went wrong for them
Until all cars are identical, is hard to say who is really the better driver.  Technical superiority, durability, strategy and lucky will have a huge influence on winning any race. Maybe let the season split into two.  Half is race with factory cars for builder Championship and the other half in Identical cars for driver championship.
i hope RB fixes their issues because there is nothing i want to see more than Max and Charles battling on track
Fuel delivery problem with RB something that was tightened up after the Ferrari investigation, and standardise pumps were made the rule by the FIA that all teams must use.
With regard to Verstappen I thinkk there is a massive difference between "being aggressive" and desperately throwing your car down the inside of a braking zone in a cloud of locked wheels and just hoping the other guy manages to avoid you.
Karma
karma is a bitch
As far as Redbull's concerned , that was what you call Karma or poetic justice.  The title was never Verstappens in the first place.
Karma for Red Bull 😂😂😂
F1 died in Abu Dhabi 🎪 🤡 show
F1 engineers now have to deal with the same issue we normies deal with in our mowers, motorcycles and small engines, ethanol gum up!
Man Ferrari did bring the best package for 2022 reg. PU working fine for an E10 fuel. Aero working great with tons of traction. No brake overheating issues with a new mandatory wheel covers. And best looking car on the grid period.
Should have never gone with #1 for his car... There's a reason not many World Champions opt for it.
Terrific opener to the season. RB=2xDNF. Hilarious!
'Fuel pump issue' eh?  The issue was there wasn't any fuel to pump!  Red Bull didn't like to say that both drivers ran out of petrol !!
How long it will take Marko and Christian to blame Honda?
haas can be competitive with the right sponsors and the right funds
Mercedes looks like a mid table car. They didn't have speed and the pit stop was slow all round the race. Not a good sign for them. Early to say but I bet Ferrari  will cake walk championship and constructor, they got fastest and reliable car and on top of that a talent like Leclerc.
strange for Mclaren
What goes around comes around for RB. No sympathy. Haas did very well. Mick Shumaker 11th. Ricardo no where to be seen.
Loved this first race. Cannot wait to see how things shake out for this season. Nice video. Keep up the good work.
Very pleased that after an injustice comes justice Way to go Lewis!
Hearing Max crying like a baby was sweet music 🎻
Simple answer, Christian's Hornerness ;]
The best part of the race was watching Charles stay cool as a fan while Max was over driving…He never gave in and  out drove Max when Max was trying to bully his way into first…this is going to be an interesting season…Mercedes got lucky (after trying those hard tires😩😩😩) but both Georgie and Lewis were consistent…
Red Bull: "It was a disaster of a start to the season."  McLaren: "At least you have a competitive package..."
It's called Karma😏
Dammit! I really felt for Sergio.
Honda Got 3 of 4 cars retired
Why isn't anybody talking about KMag?  He might have just single-handedly saved Haas.
No MASI ah..... No race win... Hollow be thy win max hollow be thy win
Learn how to pronounce drivers surname’s
Let's hear what Karen Horner has to say about Leclercs driving and team.
it was god, reclaiming fate.......
Given that it's the first race of the RBPT and ended up 2nd at 4th for most of the race was quite impressive.
Go leclerc! GO! :)
Fantastic race dramas,surprises,wheel to wheel action the lot big up the k mag hype train big up both alfa drivers having a decent result... commiserations to red bull very unlucky big up ferrari Charles what a fighter fair play.... also that save from Schumacher was class full 360 only lost 2 places and no damage
The cars look so much better on the track that they have at any point between 2017-21. I'm not just talking about the Aero, but the handling. The cars are moving around more, which makes the drivers work harder. Great start to a new era for the sport
I was a little underwhelmed by the whole thing. Where is the noise?  They looked so slow. :-(  40 odd years ive been watching and thinking  to pass on it now.
I don't mind Red Bull but I hate their fangirl fans. Anytime I know they are crying, I take solace in it.
Three Red Bull powered cars retiring, Verstappen was also complaining about 'engine braking' issues early in the race, suggests overall some reliability issues at Red Bull.
I really believe RB is hiding something with the energy system from the battery. Gasleys issue is related to both Max and Checo. They don’t want anyone talking about it. I am sure Max knows the difference between a fuel issue and battery issue. He clearly said on the radio I have a battery issue. My guess is RB power trains are drawing too much from the battery causing overheating issues. Hence why Gasleys battery was on fire. Watch next week when they turn the battery power draw down they won’t be as fast. This could just be speculation but they all seamed very quick to not talk about the battery issue that max was convinced he had.
3 red bull car's failed to finish
Karma is a BiAtch
I blame Michael Masi for the safety car. Horner should complain. He should also complain that the FIA did not gift wrap the driver's trophy properly last year so they need to award max the championship this year as compensation.
Could have waited a few more hours before spoiling the results for us Australian's.
Ferrari is back and also there engine seams to be realy good Haas and Alfa Romeo mad huge improvemants on track they had the 4th and 5th fastes car witch be honst nobody saw it coming.
Oh no how awful
Verstappen is gonna be heart broken when he realizes the only championship he won was handed to him through human error, and he gets his ass kick this year.
The C in LeclerC is silent;)
Honda issues resurface for GAS, PER and VERS
i was watching sky sports they should call it the lewis show man the anti max propaganda was strong never heard 2 grown man be such idiots when max got mad they call him a baby when he races good its the redbulll its so fucking dumb even here in the netherlands we are not that asskissing good journalism tho... olav mol would never be like that he also respect lewis and every other races man these sky sports losers make me so furious i dont wanna listen to 2 lewis hamilton fan boys
Can you make a video on why Mercedes powered car are struggling?
Ferrari engineers said that they think RB had an issue for the too much use of the K-1 mode (a mode give you a peak of power to defend or attack). Basically according to what Ferrari think, RB fried their batteries to follow them during the race, using too much and too often that power mode. A believable thing if we think at the issue Verstappen had with the steering wheel, it have behind the SC.
This was not the first time RB had a DNF in its first race of the season
Dont the Alphas have the same engines? Because no one is talking about the fact that they had 3 DNF’s
The commentator said, the last 5 cars was merc powered,, guess the Honda-red-bull engines was the ones that let go, sometimes consistency is better than raw pace,
their goals are to do everything so that people forget what happened in abu dabi.🤷 they wanted us to believe that all little arrived in a race.🤣 RedBull wants to play in our thoughts.🤸 they stole Lewis44 🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇
I loved that race ! But there's also another problem. For the team, everything was fine, but for the frustrated pilots, it wasn't. There's a lot of ways for improvement in there also.
THE RACING GODs HAS SPOKEN ,,, karma is a bitch, let’s hope for more of the same next week for them  ha
‘Human Error’ – how convenient. If Scotland Yard openly steals the Queen’s Kohinoor diamond from the Buckingham Palace after collaborating with Russia and gets caught red-handed while handing it over to Vladimir Putin, will you accept it as a ‘Human Error’ on Scotland Yard’s part and forgive it without any reprimands? And worse, would you still allow Vladimir Putin to hold on to the stolen Queen’s Kohinoor diamond? The world would be at war by now with the NATO & the UN baying for Vladimir Putin’s blood for being in wrongful possession of the stolen treasure. Instead, the FIA is proudly validating the stolen/gifted WDC by using the ridiculous ‘Human Error’ ruse. If at all anyone needs to understand with clarity what ‘Travesty of Justice’ really means, they just need to look at the FIA’s report justifying the 2021 AbuDhabi WDC fraud.
Leclerc gave him a Masterclass in wheel to wheel, like Lewis in Brazil last year. The mask of Max will fall this season as people will finally see that he lacks in that department, thus not as complete as Schumacher, Lewis, Senna etc. Because he got shown, he threw hissy fits on the radio, ironically as Max fans say Lewis is always crying. He mocked Mercedes pre race with their woes and ended up DNF’ ing. Serves him right.
I think the greatest surprise of the race was the performance of Kevin Magnussen and the Haas.
Ferrari managed a 1-2 after many years and how do you call your video? "RB disaster"... Why not McLaren disaster? Why not "Lucky Lewis and Mercedes get 3-4 places even if they were rubbish"
They deserve it.
1:50... actual footage of undercover Lewis destroying the fuel pump
Verstappen vs LeClerc could be the Verstappen vs Hamilton of 2021. It would be even better if Mercedes can improve a bit and compete with RedBull and Ferrari. What a season it could be.
E10, rubbish on the road,rubbish on the track, but is giving the Government a nice increase in tax, causing more trips to fill up for motorists, increasing pollution,more tanker deliveries increasing pollution. Usual green spin.
But what are they going to do about the wheels looking like you bought the cheapest economy car on the lot only to have the hub caps fall off?
Also Missing the Engine breaking issue he had mid corners.
Hehe!!
Me being a Perez fan, this race turned from V good to a disappointment at the worst possible time, just 1 more lap engine just 1 more lap
More pressing question. WTF’s happened to McLaren?!?
Have these new regulations actually ruined f1 I hope leclerc actually fights Mercedes. As soon as Mercedes sort out there problems they'll be hunting Ferrari I just hope leclerc doesn't pussy out
Can you guys make a video about how all the cars with Mercedes engines are slow
Mmmm … funny how MaxiPad ALWAYS blames others when he fails.  I bet he misses mickey masi the most !
You will have a problem in cold county with the car
by the way...that's 5 (!!!) ferrari engined cars in the top 10.....all you need to know about this years ferrari motor power.....goodluck to them.... oh..did i mention the merc "customer" teams...??...haha....oh dear....and all british teams too.....
It proves that being said xrappy drinks company does not make you a good e gieer. I suppose Princess Horne cried all night.
Tsunoda also warned of over-heating when pressing full on at the end of the race..especially after the Safety car  on track for so long....they really need a faster SC.....many drivers complained about its speed....
Sad to see a double DNF for any team but I’m sure red bull will get it sorted. Throughly enjoyed the race though, what a mid field result for Haas and Alfa Romeo! And what a shocker for Aston Martin and McLaren
"The race" predictions regarding the teams lineup were so wrong! So sad, bias and lacking knowledge
it was a decent race. rebull have been so relaible recently, that was a suprise. but great to see everyone back in the race
Karma
Gasly lost power first, you can see it on his steering wheel before stop and caught fire later because of hot exhaust pipes. Looks like same issue.
Garry Anderson got it wrong on Ferrari
So Happy for Ferrari, these Italians when they want can be the worst and the best.  They are their own future, but at least now they proved all the haters that they too are capable without the need of leaving Italy. I respect also the positive comments from other teams, this is how Sport should be.
PMSL.....That's just the karma you get by winning a dirty trophy....🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think Verstappen threw his dummy out the pram when he realised the gods weren't going to gift him his birthright. Perez probably made a mistake on the corner Hamilton was going to overtake him on. Verstappen's performance was the most childish I can remember. He killed his tires trying to overtake in the wrong place. LeClerc just let him go and took back the place immediately. Then Verstappen blamed his team, the car and everyone else before giving up at precisely the point it became evident he didn't have the goods for first.
Honda made the best horsepower engine in the entire grid of carmakers. Top speeds and most acceleration were at RB in testing and race (double speed compared to Leclerc). Something was not tested as it should... Such a bummer, hope a revenge in the next weekend!
Max win by Mas last year and this year he take the number 01 in his car, ridiculous and comical
Not going to lie I really hope that red bull's engine is a dud, after all the stuff that happened to Gasley and Albon I really can't see how people can get behind that team
Please do not call the bio ethanol "greener" this has been debunked many times as false.
LEC was really clever, he knew that even with battery power max would've probably passed him on turn 1 since the straight is so long, but then he could take back the position on turn 4 with DRS and battery power, and if Max tried to counter with the same strategy he would've had a much harder time passing lec in turn 4 full battery vs full battery because the straight is much shorter
that's not how you pronounce "Leclerc"
I’m a Ferrari fan but I really hope Max has a fair fight for the title.
Jesus! The only excuse Crash test Max didn't use was " The Sun was in my eyes" 🤣
RB issue- Karma
I hate redbull and hate mercedes mostly because there high and mighty still dont mind the drivers though. Just there team boss and garbage
This was the Best and most interesting race of the last 20 some years. The new rules delivered in their promises and intent.
Max should put back the lucky 33 number instead of the 1 number
Leclerk... Really?? FFS this is his 5th season and you still can't say his name right
The only thing I was thinking when both Red Bull cars broke was "KARMA". Karma is watching and eventually is going to come back at  you. This is for their unfair win of 2021 championship. If they had followed the rules they should have finished the last race of 2021 with a safety car.
Great result for all genuine F1 fans. Mr Ginger Spice and Miserable Max kept off our screens for once. Now if only the fizzy drink team could disappear permanently all would be well.
I was so made up and Max bad mouthing LEWIS and bragging by having a number 1 on his car while Sir Lewis still stuck with his number 44 and won 6 F1 World Championships and 1 F1 World Championship with MaClaren Horner got what he deserved who he is obsessed with Sir Lewis and Toto get in Sir Lewis and George Russell. Karma is a b*tch and what goes around comes around FACT
So satisfying hearing the fake champ shit talk his car and team
Fail to prepare so prepare to fail.  Lol.
So it turns out Hamilton was telling the truth after testing👍
I'm evenly impressed for Ferrari as a whole. Where they, in the past, also lacked in pitstops and bad strategy calls, they were on point yesterday with everything.
RedBull will fix their problems.  It was just bad karma for being a team of bullies.  Lucky Mercs 😅
I’m not so sure it is actually a fuel problem. Just look at Sergio, the cars electrics went off suddenly and the engine cut and locked. Seems more electrical surely.
And as usual, lucky little lulu hamiflaps benefitted and got another undeserved podium.
Can you guys do a video on the poor performance of McLaren? I'm at a loss for their poor performance and would love an analysis of it. Cheers
As a RB fan, I can only be happy with the Ferrari podium. We need battle 👍
I am happy the Ferraris won. I am happier Max lost.
What I don't understand is why Max re-signed for so many year BEFORE the first race of the new era. And also for a driver who said who he loves his team, he sure was not speaking well at them at the radio.
Indeed very clever driving from Leclerc, defending his position and using the advantage of 2nd DRS zone to take his 1st place back right away. To honest, I was really surprised (and a bit disappointed) that Verstappen didn’t use the same trick to his advantage - leave LEC in front of him at the end of the main straight, and overtake in the 2nd DRS zone, and try to build up some gap in the remaining part of the lap. Instead, he fell for the same trap 3 times in a row, until he finally cooked his brakes.
E10 10% greener energy. My goodness that is the stupidest science mind twist ever. E10 effectively might be more polluting than standard fuel based on the effort of production life cycle. Virtuous stupidity. Like hamilton wearing a mask, or kneeling for black lives, while going to china for a race.
They ran out of fuel... Renault power units are burning more fuel then expected.
3 engines toast in 1 race........one of them even catching fire......Maybe Honda-RB have lost a step with all the "we do it, no no, you do it again but only for three years until we know how to do it" I mean, Honda was pulling out for money problems, i dont know if they are gonna put a ton of resources into this specially when RB is gonna take over in 3 years.....feels kinda worrying for RB. Not that i care at all about RB winning, as long as the races and the title are a thrill, but could be a rough season for RB and having them on full form ensures another contender..... but maybe im reaching and it was just a bad day!
They recreated the final race from last year. Just to justify that Verstappen actually won the race fairly. This time around they showed that its possible for them to loose. Same scenario different outcome… this is just a show… this was basically a justification for last year… this scripted sport is sickening…
Little hammy  wasn't  crying  today GIVEN A PLACE ON THE PODIUM
what caused it? Karma.
lack of testing and quality assurance, Fire Horner
So hope they loose this year without Micheal masi

Its aight
E10... laughs in INDYCAR's E85
This season will be epic, if multiple teams end up fighting for the championships. F1 2022 is firing up to be awesome!!
The commentators seemed quite pleased to see red bull dnf and Hamilton come third
Its insane how good the Ferrari works
Cant wait for teams to figure out the issues and catch up to the Ferraris and Red Bulls. Even if we have 3/4 teams rotating wins and keeping the top of the field competitive, ill be happy. Some really good racing at points today but it was pretty obvious Ferrari developed the best cars and Merc and everyone below had a lot of work to do. The gaps in times seemed a little concerning. Kinda felt like there would be tiers of competitive racing throughout the field but each tier would be seperated by a unmanagable difference unless we get safty cars. Really hope Mercedes, Mclaren and others can figure out their problems. Probably because Im biased and want a competitive field with Hamilton back at the top but id take good racing over Hamilton winning I guess ;P
There’s definitely something wrong with Mercedes Engine. Having all customer teams finished at the bottom six, excluding DNFs, isn’t normal.
This race was horrible for us RB fans but I am glad to see them challenge ferrari
Redbull out 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Super sad to see RedBull lose like that, but so stoked for this season, this could be the best season in last ~10 years
Yuki did a great job
Karma Max.... Karma
An excellent race really enjoyed seeing the reds at the front 👏 great work from the team  Shame about the gap between the front pack and the rear of the field looked impossible to come back once so far behind 😕 at around lap 32 but safety car restart was great 👍 helped it all stay relatively close
Forza Ferrai!!!!!
Hats off to Ferrari, though the performance of KMag and Haas was an even greater joy to see. Meanwhile, Toto Wolff, who has been living rent-free inside Horner's head for the last couple of years, must've been working overtime to hide his smile after witnessing divine justice for RB and listening to Verstappen throwing his toys out of the pram when things didn't go his way. A great start to the season.
Ethanol is not actually greener. It becomes 'greener' after around 25 years!
KARMA !!!
No doubt about it, 'KARMA' pure and simple. :-)
You guys are getting sloppy: you didn’t ask us to subscribe in this video
"Disaster"? Nobody died.  Double DNF, yes. But lessons learned?
Disaster for RB. To lose these points at this stage is monumental given the reliability of Mercedes and Ferrari. 3 HRC failures in one race.
Honda effect on Redbull
Max is like a bull in a China shop, lunging down the inside only to lock his brakes up massively to complete the corner while LeClerc looked smooth.
As much as I like Perez and redbull I really don't like the arrogance and attitude of max . The team had put everything into the car. And things do go wrong. MAX  is someone who puts his personal glory ahead of the teams.
Pity for RB but amazing to see Hamilton showing he is an average driver when his car is not way faster than the rest.
A  failed fuel pump shouldn't cause checos engine to seize, one tweaked tie-rod shou;dn't cause heavy steering in all conditions; i think RBR aren't being forright with us
Calm down everybody, its only the first race...
Give up nax n red bull
Wishing them many more DNFs this coming 4 years. They cheated last year and they must absorb the karma
I think the main problem for red bull was all that  bad karma from Abu Dhabi 😁  Ok ok, I gtfo, sorry I had to.
Make a video celebrating Ferrari. Why should we watch a video on red bull????? Are you guys perhaps red bull fans or unbiased and neutral?
I hope it's last comments on this channel.  Become a responsible and serious journalists team using facts and not making a very poor job of just saying what we already know... Really? the fuel? Maybe? So RB is not in F1 ? They didn't know how to work with the fuel..  hm .. smart. Make real journalism.  Make videos when you have something to say.  Context not quantity
Music on the background sounds like Burial
Redbull is just the average adrian newey machine
These 2022 cars looks slow as fk
They where stronger then ferrari and with redbull resurs they will fix this problem for next race. This year probably will be a battle between redbull and ferrari until mercedes have found and tweak its performance and then they will be fighting for the top.
Nothing more rewarding than redbull suffering.
Eco terrorist destroying everything, E10 fuel, what a nonsens. Use trains instead of cars and leave F1 alone.
You have so many subscribers. Respect us and do some real journalism. What you knew we knew. Anything else?
And Max didn't let Charles go due to overheating breaks..he was behind Charles since lap 1..he just didn't get to fight him for a long time
I wanna see that video on what's going on with mercedes soon
Max was back to his childish petulant old self with his whinging and general back chat to the team. He needs to do a lot of maturing
Wow.. just don't make a video, if you have nothing to say about what really happened to his terminal exit off the gp
One word, karma.   Get fucked RB 😂😂😂😂😂
Let's hope this doesn't become a trend, lest Verstappen's title defence becomes as bad as Hakkinen's in 2000.
You love to see it
For RedBull.., it is called KARMA..! (I don't know Mercedes can do something with their car to make it fast, but this year RB shouldn't be there enjoying, just like they cried in 2014)
redbull karma
Its indeed heart breaking to see the late reitrement of the RB18s and AlphaTuri in the closing laps of the inaugural race of the aero era.   But in hindsight having problems now is better than later. All teams imo have work to do be it the chaser or chased. Ground effect cars are very hostile to irregularities of the track surface.   Lets not forget we have yet to see racing on street circuits and wet weather conditions those will definitely be a S curve ball for all teams.
I was there, you should've heard the crowd when Sainz passed Max and Hamilton passed Serio. WHOA😁
For the first time in a long time I actually sat through a whole race. I usually stop watching about lap 30 because of the amount of uneventful action. I honestly hope this is a start to a year we’re Mercedes isn’t as dominant as they have been since the start of the V6T Era
Karma!
The Ferrari engine is looking fast this season. Slow button OFF!
Very entertain for us who don't like Verstappen or Red Bull. I don't care who wins as long as it's not Max or Lewis. I hope some of the smaller teams make great gains over the season.
They ran out of fuel
Lol 😂
What caused Red Bull's nightmare? In the first race following the most blatant and monumental heist in Formula 1 ever? That they were shamelessly and brazenly gloating about? The very weekend a gutless so-called investigation report whitewashed the whole fiasco? It is called Karma.
Ah. Ethanol added. Makes total sense. It kills cars.
Hope this season is a learning experience for Verstappen / RB.  The first chapter was a good first lesson in hopefully a series of valuable education.
What was the cause?   Masi departure...
How has it taken the race so long to put out any content? Nothing from qualifying the race or practice?
Ferrari have done their homework. There will be no surprises when Red Bull solves these issues.
Karma
As long Lewis Hamilton did NOT win!
Karma!
Can’t defend a championship that was given to you 🙃👀
lmfao lmfao
People complain that Lewis loves to moan but my god ! Max is a child !
I think F1 needs to get rid of the low profile tires
KARMA, Punishment for stealing  win @AbuDhabi 2021
It's called karma.
it is red bulls engine now. honda has nothing to do with it anymore. red has no history of building engines.
Is fuel pump considered part of power unit? If yes, red bull will get penalty if they replace it on saudi race
Don’t get fooled by the initial fuel pumps failure report! They all use the same fuel pump supplier. What are the chances of both RB having the same issue right at the end of the race? RB wouldn’t admit it, but they simply ran OUT OF FUEL! Think about this for a second… which RB ran out of power first? MAX’s! He was pushing his car very hard the whole race. Perez’s car would’ve made it, if Hamilton wasn’t pressuring him hard at the end. RedBull was trying to outsmart everyone by adding less fuel in their cars so they can have weight advantage throughout. If the fuel pumps cut off, they wouldn’t have a chance to report engine power loss and still go lap and a half. They were simply running out of fuel.
Can't wait to see where Haas end up. More Haas than class.
Annoying background NOISE!
Karma
Couldn't  happen to a nicer team, great result for the paper champ.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏🤣
Unbelievable race. What a disappointment for Red Bull. But this will just make them come back better
The most completed laps during was Mercedes, AlphaTauri and Ferrari. Let that sink in.
Who said Karma doesn’t exist 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Great title challenge i rekon if max can continue to get the most out that car its gonna be a great season between leclerc and Verstappen
Pity Masi has been relieved of his duties - I am sure he could have engineered at least a podium for Verstappen.
Karma
finesse of the horse versus aggresion of the bull. i prefer the finesse, but some might not.
I would bet that driving behind the safety car overheated both cars causing fuel pump failures
I wonder if the - in lack of a better word - corrosive nature of ethanol plays any role in this...
Soooo Awesome! Max is gonna learn that having gold shoes, gold helmet, and the number 1 on his car doesn't make him a champion!
Leclerc is fantastic racer who is known for dominating competition. Now with a decent car, he is really hard to beat
is it me or dose verstappen look like a pug
You can do all the analysis you want! but it's KARMA!
Calling red bull result a disaster is extreme, mclaren and aston martin results do are a disaster.
E10 has caused a lot of problems before in the real world.
It was not a horror show.  It was comical
Great win by Leclerc.
Im the most excited fór Haas
might have been caused partly due to the safety car as well. maybe not enough air went through the car due to the lower speeds, amplifying the problem they already had with temps
I just wish michael masi fuel has gone.
The oracle doest work
Last season racing started clean, jus like this, but ended up toxic . Testing is to test as many scenarios as possible, and redbull didn't. They just wanted to set top times.. for me, I would bet mercedes used testing to the most even if their car is not yet that competitive.
This is why we don’t use E10.
Why didn't it happen to others?
New regulations suck Greener my arse
Max was never going to win yesterday. When Gasley's car broke down Max was 26 s behind Lec with 12 laps to go. That makes it 2+ s per lap for Max to catch up to Lec, and RB/Max did not have the answer to that. I would say that the safety car helped Max more than Lec. Yes, Lec got a free (or cheap) pitstop, but it also put Max right up into his rear wing. And as we all saw after the first pitstops Max still loves divebombs.
I’m super impressed at how well Magnussen has been performing in the Haas… didn’t quite expect that!
Red Bull and Verstappen needs to DNF all of the races this year... That way we can enjoy less rubbish spewing out of Horner's mouth, while enjoying clean racing from the rest of the drivers...
Karma strikes quickly!🤣
Max still fought till the end , that Ferrari engine is a menace. Excited for Sainz vs Leclerc.
Last 6 cars were all Merc powered. Sad to see McLaren in these positions.
Here comes all the RBR excuses
I’ll tell you what caused it without watching the video. It’s a little bit of justice and I hope we get much more of it. They’re a team of energy drink selling pigs.
Loving the high quality content, hours after the event. Kudos
Big brain LeClerc. Class driver. Cant wait for Merc to get their act together and RB to fix their engine so we can have a real 6 way battle at the front of the grid.
I call him MaxBcrashin 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 gratzi rigatzi ❤💛🖤❤💛🖤
"Fuel Pump Issues" is code for "we ran out of gas."
Hopefully this was a one-time thing
really cool to see haas up there tho
Fia should give constructors +1 extra change on all parts. It’s a totally new car , 23 races we’ll see loads of penalties 🥺
I'm sure Masi could fix that for RB. Oh wait...
Verstappen: moan, moan, whinge, whinge. Le Clerc is a polite and humble gentleman who will be a future Champion. Verstappen should drink less Red Bull.
Great job, love the videos, but please the last c in Leclerc is silent.
Well the race was amazing. Could only have been improved if Hamilton was dnf as well.
Can you please do a run down on the Haas R&D through the 2021 season and what we may see for the rest of the season?
wat we learned about powertrains from bahrian:  ferrari: fast rbpt: fast, but not reliable merc: yes reno: slow but faster than a merc if that merc is not a merc
E10 is not green and is dumb. Hopefully as the US reviews their ethanol fuel policy this year they act and can lead the world out of this renewable fuel "green" lie/myth. The fact the world's premier motor racing series has simply believed this myth without proper investigation and now let it tarnish this new era is sad especially since it is in the same year the world has started to wake up to the dirty truth of E10 fuel.
This channel uses such negative words for RB and more positive words for Merc and anything British. Seem like pundits that cannot think neutral.
How much gas they have left?
Let's just say Renault is laughing behind the scenes at RedBull.
MV and Checo"s cars were not ready to be pushed to that racing level. This is why the cars shut down completely.
it was caused by human error
Does the engine freeze come into play? Are they able to fix it or do they have to live with it and keep replacing engines for 4 years?
Karma is a b*tch
Max might want to reconsider putting the #1 on his car, it a curse!
The fuel pump and fuel system for E10 must be sturdier and harder component compared to the normal petrol. This can normally be seen with the normal road car that can use ethanol as thier fuel. Ethanol are very corrosive, much more corrosive than normal petrol. Maybe Redbull didn't see this before, but to be honest, Im surprised they didn't know it beforehand. Its quite a basic information. Every car tuner out there that use ethanol know that they must have special fuel pump and fuel line to prevent fuel pump damages
absolutely love to see redbull and mclaren fall apart
Titles like this is exactly why I can't subscribe to this channel...
Ethanol is WORSE for the environment, and what you said was not in the text...
5:25 Allow me to amend your statement:  verstapen has earned a reputation as the most danegerous and irresponsible driver on the grid when it comes to wheel-to-wheel combat
I hope there will be a 3 way battle for the title.
this was such an incredible race i cant wait for jedda
As always, race provides biased and shitty content
they gonna blame Mercedes lol
Adding ethanol was a bad idea, it gunk's up engine parts and worst it's  just a part of an evil doctrine like all electric vehicles. A hybrid is superior and way more environmentally sound; yet the push, really sad. Every resource we have can be used wisely with good stewardship but not all ideas are expedient.
Change your number back to 33, Max
They have the fastest car so I don't think red bull will be too worried.
Karma this what happens
Karma
still crushed by this failure because of a bad part made by a third party manufacturer and apparently this part is known to be a problem.
I am soooo happy for the Ferrari 1-2 , YES!!!
This is like the script to Pixar’s Cars 2… new bio fuel… cars randomly overheating and catching on fire… Now we wait to see who the villain is! Perhaps a disgruntled Michael Masi after his removal after last years finale!
karma
M VERSTATEN Couldn't happen to a nicer driver NOT, I am surprised Max didn't push  Leclerc off the track.
Sounds like Charles has watched Top Gun recently...
Lmfao couldn't have happened to a better group 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣
So, Red Bull's DNF was due to faulty spec fuel pumps supplied by the FIA. Interesting...
If you think about it 3/4 redbull power trains had issues
I'm glad cheatstappen lost
If there’s a time to mess up that big is right now it fixes future problems in more important races
Karma
So basically, RB's new car is a mess. Wow. Anyways, I'm surprised with how Haas performed.
3 out of 4 Honda powered cars DNF  ... Can't just be a coincidence
Meh tough luck bud
With RedBull's reliability woes I suspect it would be likely linked to the RB Powertrain side.  Highly improbable it would be on the Honda factory side. Honda's impecable construction/assembly and reliability/durability issues tested over last few seasons.
👍🏽 KARMA
I’m a total novice with this stuff but seems like redbull have a lot of work to do in the weeks to come 😂
Phenomenal
God don't like ugly
So the top three team standing are, Ferrari, Mercedes and Haas. K-Mag really pulled some hard. If Mick is able to push that hard top, Haas could easily get the 4th on constructors.
Cars 2 comes to mind 😐 the whole biofuel thing 😂
Im more worried about Merc, they are way behind the pace. I expected more DNF to be honest. A lot yet to sort out, I haven’t seen Merc way this behind on the start of the season they are 20+ seconds off pace before the saferty car. Even with a struggling RedBull they cant over take them until they totally lost power.
Rigged for dramatic effect lol
Haas and alfpha didn't have problem because of the temp we will see in Europe if they even finish the line
2 honda engines stalled in a race ? and 1 on fire ?
Make a video about Haas' sublime return to the midfield running.
If they no problem max will definitely win the race They all support to the c lectric they always gave drs to the ferraris but the real champion is max vesterpen
So how long will it be until we find out the Ferrari has another illegal engine?
My biggest surprise was that there weren't more retirements.  After all the drama over porpoising at testing, I figured a few of them would shake themselves apart.  I'd predicted 7 DNFs due to mechanical issues.  Glad I was wrong
I hope we get these type of races all season bc it was exciting. I’m a Merc fan but happy to see Ferrari on top.
F1 is back, baby!
Absolute nightmare of a start...terrible
When Max last year won that unfair last race which should have been excluded. Max droped to a very low place for me... Both his way to drive and Redbulls way to look at that race .  And look at MadMax today. ..an empty facial expression... Actually well deserved that both cars broke ... And I really hope this is what their season will look like.   This start therefore gets 5 stars out of 5 from me. Now when also Ferrari seems to be back.... But Ferrari is Italien and because of that also impossible to trust.... 🤔
A lot of folks made a big deal over Mercedes skinny side pods, but the fastest car on the track has the biggest, bodies side pods.  I don't see the Mercedes approach to be paying any dividends, and with budget caps, no team can afford to be constantly retooling their bodywork.
Don't worry, they will be back stronger than ever.
5:25 hahahaha!! if verstappen's car was as fast as the ferrari, leclerc would have ended up in the grass.
2 factory and satellite team dnf is bad for redbull new power unit.
Everyone talking about RB or Ferrari but let's give HASS the honor they deserve for pulling such an unbelieveble run with Magnussen and even getting into the points, well deserved Gunther!!!
You even forgot Ferrari pitstop were very fast as compared to RED BULLS
Man the battle between Max and Charles was epic, sucks that’s Max and Perez couldn’t finish the race but as a Lewis fan am happy with that results
Karma!
Need a video on Mclaren too, it’s totally chaotic as to what is happening to the car
Its bad luck for the fake champion
Most pathetic result for a red bull no.1 car since 2014
The way leclerc found gap and got ahead of max at turn 4 (i forgot the lap) shows that he deserved the win !!
Bravery, intelligence, and patience
Perfect outcome...  Maybe Max needs to call Masi earlier
Awesome race!!! Congratulations Ferrari, solid car this year. Expect Mercedes to unleash the beast in the next race or the one after. It’s not a question of if but when
Max even in a slower car will never concede that he couldn’t keep Leclerc behind because he has in his pocket his favorite go to card , crashing you out.
just get the e10 public relations fuel out of the cars its garbage always has been
Redbull needs to sort their engine issues 3 out 4 engine failing is not a good sign.
Red Boom!
Looks like the universe did not want RB to score a single point today. Hope the issue is not a major. We needed such close racing.
It’s amazing to me that putting 10% ethanol fuel in the cars makes them run so badly, while Indycar has been using 85% ethanol for years.  What’s even more amazing is that the engines in Indycar (partially) are HONDAS!
How about the racing today? Hope this is a sign of things to come
4:48 ITALIAN JESUS!!!!!!
I still can't stop smiling 😂
That's awesome news for Redbull, I hope this shit continues for the entire year
Scarbs has said the part that failed is a new spec part within the fuel system. This is a failure a lot of teams have seen throughout testing. McLaren were actually allowed to change this part after qualy. So it's not necessarily Honda specific, but still cause for concern.
Karma XD
1:43
Its not fair Mikey......... Me thinks Mercedes have turned up with a directed energy weapon the way those Honda's stopped dead when they have not through the whole testing period...... Point it at the car and make the fuel overheat.......
It was nice to see the Safety Car regulations being followed correctly. Congrats to Ferrari, a well deserved 1-2.
Karma Abu Dhabio.
That battle with Charles and max was epic. I really hope this year we see more.
ugh... spoiler thumbnail... i havent watch my recording yet T_T
Very unlucky day for Red Bull... Hopefully the reliability issues get sorted before Saudi Arabia!
Max is a whining excuse machine. I've said ever since Leclerc first arrived that either he or Russel were the best young guns in the field, not max because they have talent and they never get rattled by anything. Both are as cool as the dark side of the pillow. with max saying he'd have led the race if they hadn't told him not to push the outlap is baloney. He did a very hot out-lap trying to get the undercut. He made up close to 3 seconds on the out-lap and a lap later took the lead which gave us that battle that ended when he locked up the tires trying to pass Leclerc got repassed going into turn four. He ruined that set of tires overheated the brakes and Leclerc extended the lead. Red Bull's explanations of what happened near the end make no sense. Bent steering rod from dropping off the jacks? Baloney. And we don't have an explanation for the retirement of Max in the announcers had it wrong claiming that Perez's engine had locked up. No engine smoke no tire smoke. Did you see his rear tires? They were wrecked. I think Lewis may have got him before the end if that hadn't happened. He was right on his tail.
Perhaps this race was Justice, for the manner in which he won the championship last season?
Ferrari is for real as long as durability is solid. At least half a season to a whole season before a team can catch their pace. Red Bull will need precise strategy. Mercedes needs Russell to assume Bottas' role and plow straight through rivals! And Mclaren needs a new car.
That's just karma biting them in their ass
I think this year it's going to be a redbull, ferrari and Mercedes split
Flat brim hat… End of story. Ikyky
red bull race thinking that other team doesn’t study crashtapen.. they are so wrong.. charles did amazingly well managing the attitude
I love how the action was from the front all the way to the back of the field. This season is gonna be a banger! 🙌🏽
karma for illegitimate championship last year?
I swear I heard Crofty and the Sky Sports team climax when Max's car failed.................. nearly every comment they made about Red Bull was prefixed with the word aggressive, 25 times in total............ Skys F1 bias in coverage makes Russia's coverage of the Ukraine invasion look even handed.
Oooh someone run bck with the tail stuck in the middle, karma pay back to those talk thrash boy. Suck it an go cry to ur mama
As Max fan disappointed with the result, but excited with the season. This is gonna be great!
It's was a beautiful result for ferrari and Mercedes.
Why are they going to ethanol blended fuels that were thought to someday reduce the carbon footprint of engine it’s using ethanol blend fuel. In 2010 the VPA learned that simply following new fields to plant corn to be used to make ethanol actually releases more carbon into the atmosphere than any possible benefits from the corn could produce.. that’s not even counting the carbon footprint of harvesting, and processing the corn into ethanol, and it’s not taking into account the carbon footprint created by clearing the land, and the equipment to plant the corn carbon footprint.. The EPA has known that the ethanol experiment is producing results that are the opposite of the intention by 24% higher carbon footprint.    plants like corn absorb carbon dioxide and put the carbon into the earth, simply plowing a field releases enormous quantities of carbon stored by plants into the soil over hundreds if years back into the atmosphere…    we need to look at the science and put politics behind this effort by environmentalists as well as corn growers lobbyists. Politics and science don’t always mix. How the hell did the formula 1 rules & regulations idea men ever get drawn into this “ trendy” idea?   what’s next down the road? solar powered f1 cars aided by pedal power?  How about methanol powered F1 cars powered by  captured methane from cows that must wear tags on their back 24 / 7 to collect the approximate 50 cubic feet of methane produced by every cow every day? Or even collection of human waste methane gas captured from  waste water treatment plants?    I always loved Formula One because at one time it was the pinnacle of advancement.. but the governing body keeps imposing obstacles  on the engineers and designers of these fantastic machines not in the name of fair play, but to be trendy
The only thing that sucked today were the graphics.
Where's Gary now? He said Ferrari were gonna be disappointing, that claim aged very well now...
Despite the economic downturn, I'm so happy.  I have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my $ 7,000 investment every 14days.
It was a phenomenal race
3 out of the 4 red bull (honda) engines are gone and the only one driven by a japanese driver was able to finish and scored 2 points.... is it intentional by honda....?
Well ... you could've talked about Charles's win and Ferrari before this video.
RB fan here, we're in for a really entertaining season even better than last season
Redbull screwed up 2022
So sorry for max 😢
Red bull should of kept the Honda advertisement more prominence.These guy are pretty much doing free work for RB 😂
Can you  make a video about Mercedes engine's are they now the worst on the grid ???
Karma caused it
Wait a moment?  Engine problems at Red Bull.  Is it too late for them to throw Honda under the bus?  (Now, if the last race of last season had been handle like this race, Max would be a 0 times world champion.)
RBS straight line speed was outstanding. I have a question, does improved straight line speed consume more fuel or PU energy? It's nice to have the fastest car on the track but sometimes slow and steady wins the race. In my opinion it was simply a fuel issue.
Didn't realise it was Ferrari's first 1-2 since 2010
A PERFECT START TO THE SEASON ;))))))
Max is a grumpy sook when things don't go his way may be karma for last year
Why no low fuel or race simulation?
Karma caused it, or maybe a "human error" 😂😂
not really interested in the red bull problems at all... just astonished at how dominant ferrari was  like we knew they were going to be good but that good?
Such an awesome moment to see SIR LEWIS on podium.
It's weird...Because when he said he was having battery power issues, his engineer was like "No everything is fine with the battery" 🤔🤔🤔🤔. Hope he didn't buckle
FML
Am I the only one thinking sabotage? Crazy that within a few laps 3 Hondas go down & no points at all scored for Red Bull.   I’m not a Red Bull fan, but I can’t help but thing fowl play must have been involved. Amazing drama!!
Hahahahahha is all I want to say.
I’m surprised HaaS hasn’t paid back the money from when Russia invaded Crimea.  I wonder what’s taking so long.
Love it suck shit redbull lets go ferrari
If Red Bull didn't implode Mercedes wouldn't even be able to get a podium or get higher points. Red Bull just needs to fix reliability and they're all good.
Leclerc is clever rather an all out aggressive like Max. Interesting to see the two different driving styles between two guys who will inevitably be rivals. I've been waiting for this fight since 2019.
Ferrari will win on morale alone.
Cheats never prosper. Pure karma
I am the biggest Mercedes fan but I’m no Ferrari hater, they haven’t just made the prettiest car on the grid, they have also got quickest, if leclerc or saint win the title I ain’t mad. For a Ferrari, if it ain’t lewis or Russel let it be Ferrari.the sport needs it
Red Bull & Verstappen met KARMA today!!! LOL. And she IS a BITCH! LOL. Christian Horner will attempt to blame the complete team DNF on Mercedes by Wednesday. LOL.
I don't know much about F1 but it seems to me that the fuel change wasn't thought out very thoroughly... what was the point in making that change?
Vercrashen is average against another competitive car and driver.
Honda glad they don't have any stickers on those two cars anymore.  Redbull have a history of burning their engine suppliers so be interesting if the pattern continues this year.
Leclerc is a top notch driver. He will show it now that he has a good car.
Ruined F1 due to some ethanol fuel?
It's hear breaking to watch Redbull disaster but very happy to see Ferrari glory day's
Mercedes had some awful pitstops
karma
Karma
It’s not a disaster it’s a miracle
Karma got the best of Verstappen today
I'm just happy that Max is getting more mature with this unfortunate events.
I'm guessing Masi couldn't do nothing this time... RIP.
Hat off to you guys, for cranking out such informative videos so soon after the Grand Prix.
Now max fans can see what a true cry baby he is and again if it wasn't for the massi and the screw up he wouldn't be a champ because the truth is coming out he doesn't have the mentality of a champion like Lewis.... he showed he's true colors because he's a true chump.
Max either has been told to stop the careless and dangerous driving.....or he has lost his edge after "winning". If that was Hamilton in front of him he would have wrecked him.
Its easy, Redbull choose performance > reliability they choose to use more engine over battery. In the long run, battery was drained and engine was warped. Lets not forget that this race took part during night at low temperatures. I foresee more issues for Redbull in the next cmg racers as we progress into different altitudes and daytime. They have 6 days to test before race day.
Karma is a B
No fault of their own so that was rotten luck
Very good race for Ferrari but still way too early to tell what will shake out from one race. I bet Redbull will have everything sorted in 2-3 races and same with Mercedes. I bet Ferrari finished 3rd in constructors
Max doesnt know what to do... Well he can call Masi to power him up 😂😂😂
Wouldn't it make sense to use green fule crap for all the shipping and haulzge between races rather than during the fecking race?!
Karma for Red Bull continuing to do business in Russia
They r using two batteries and they under estimated their fuel burn rate.
F1 not important facts: 1. Since 2017, whoever won the first grand prix never won the driver's championship that year.   2. Whenever Haas had a great opening race, they end up at the back later on in the season.  3. Haas has the most 2 drivers DNF in the season opener in 2020, 2018, and 2017 in the past 5 years. (Red Bull in deep trouble?)  4. Last Ferrari 1-2 in season opener was Bahrain 2010. (Ferrari lose to Red Bull in final race?)
Verstappen is just a bit baby who I wish would just grow up a bit and mature. I honestly can't remember another driver like him, he just whinges all the time, it's tiring. He's an amazing driver but I just hate his mentality and attitude and don't see what everyone else sees in him.
Pound for pound, put all them in the same car and Leclerc is arguably one of the best!
Two great races at Atlanta and texas today. Then there was the boredom of F-1.
There is an impostor inside red bull... so sus haha
Another win for Ferrari was the pit stops. They were faster than RB.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Poor pit stops by Red Bull and the power unit seems to be a little off because three Red Bulls basically didn’t finish. Hopefully they can bounce back in Saudi Arabia
Gonna be a neat season for us as enthusiasts for sure.
I do not like these cars, there's something about them that's not right
Before the race there was an emergency wire attached near the steering; if Crashtappen couldn’t beat the guys for podium he’s to pull the wire and shut down the car giving him an excuse; RB ….KARMA is gonna get you.
I'm a Max fan, but i'm happy for Leclerc...a well deserved win, Ferrari did great and came back strong so i hope this will be an interesting season to see them back in the top as well.
Absolutely brilliant dose of karma.
Hahahaha! Karma is real!!!
Grandissima Ferrari!!
Do all front wings flex like Mercedes front wing is. You can see it lay flat at high speed.
Max is undoubtedly a very good f1 pilot compared to some of the best. But Leclerc in a similar machinery is a match. Leclerc thinks like Max, drives like Max, and analyses like Max. I still think Max is the best, but Leclerc can be equal to Max's abilities.
Red bull scoring no points is so beautiful. Fuck Max, Jos, Horner, and Marko.
Karma
I cannot wait for the next Charles vs Max battle. It's going to be amazing to watch somebody push Max around for a change.
Over clocking the battery
Delighted for the cheats of last season, CARMA at its best
I'm impressed the Haas is very competitive this year. Looks like they will be very competitive this year. VB driving for Alfa also gives them a great uplift. 2022 looks like another great season
The genuine racing fans will have little issue with this...
Fuel pump were provided by FIA.
Both redbull teams had huge issues.
Max mist not work on cars. Anything that can happen..... Well can hapoen
Ferrari are back in town. Great to see. Anything but RedBull please.
I'm not surprised some cars still have problems. Should definitely be solved within a few races!
KARMA
CLC drove such a clever race, it payed off 26pts in the WDC
Karma caused it 😄
K Mag proves that a skilled driver can make a slow car be fast. Lewis on the other hand needs a fast car to win.
Ferrari is not coming slow and same goes for Haas
HAAS tho
2:30 Flawed testing? Very good insight to have with that.
Double dnf for red bull, glorious
RB looks like having reliability issues, and a Red Bull powered car on fire
FYI qualifying on the 26th March will mark 7 years since Saudi started bombing Yemen, along with them executing 81 people in one go and official documents showing them working with Al-qaeda its an absolute disgrace F1 is going there. All the drivers with Ukrainian flags, "No to War" and "end war" messages are hypocrites racing there. And seeing as F1 wants to be conscientious getting rid of Mazepin, why is a Chinese driver allowed on the grid? Are the Uyghurs unworthy victims? If they are going to start all this, America has to go too, theyre bombing Somalia and currently occupying a third of Syria, along with sieging Yemen, which is a war crime. Ignoring the 26 biolabs they have in Ukraine, arming Neo-nazis, enginerring the coup in 2014, starting the whole Orange Revolution, the 1 million Iraqs that died and their drone programs killing 95% innocents, they are the worlds biggest terrorists and threat to world peace. But will any of this happen? No, absolute propagandised hypocrites.
So sad for Max, Perez,  RedBull Honda racing teams and Pierre and Alpha Tauri Honda teams.  Maybe it's worth looking into  Italian made and supplied fuel pumps issues and 2 Italian  cars finished 1 and 2. Either way, both Ferrari drivers did well and congratulations.  Hamilton and Russell did well too and congratulations.  All top 12 did very good and congratulations including Yuki and Alpha Tauri Honda with moving up so many places to 8th...driver of the day for  me.
The imposter got what he deserve. Karma gets everyione whom steal from others. This time no Masi to save him. I was super happy with last few laps.
This season is gonna rock.
Instant Karma
The chickens have come home to rost.
Is it related to Pierre’s fire?  Don’t they have the same powertrain?
Im really confused why rb would do no low fuel or full race simulations during testing? Seems il advised
Karma
Great stuff 💙. Btw whats the name of the song playing in the back?
Those Ferrari engines are bullets! Top 10  - 2 Mercedes 1 RB 2 Alpines and 5! Ferrari powered cars!   When Chuck passed Max into turn 4 it looked like the RB was sitting still
I really thought Hamilton and Russell weren't going to be on the potential podium until the Red Bull cars broke.
I loved to see those Bulls dnf.
All that hype!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
ethanol is not green at all.  its crazy that some of the smartest engineers in the world haven't protested the e10 change.  Its worse for the environment than regular, fossil based fuel.  If we want F1 to be greener, increase the battery size and increase the allowed power that the MGU-K can regen and deliver.  Maybe stop holding Gran Prix in countries that actively lobby against climate change initiatives
I wonder what these cars would be like if they had active or more advanced suspension...
CARma … Abu Dhabi
Redbull disaster???? Then what are we gonna sayabout mclaren?
The main and only problem for red bull is that Michael Masi is no longer there. Without Masi, red bull is just a coffee.
Real irony is I'm pretty sure ethanol blended fuel is worse for the climate than without it. What a farce
Man I wish THE RACE were the official presenters in the Paddock.  Listening to Rosanna Tennant is absolute murder, I couldnt get thru the F1 post race show- She is an absolute muppet.
Drives me up the wall hearing people not pronouncing a name that is said ALL the time . NOT  Le-CLERK ....Le-CLAIRE LECLAIRE FUCK. You follow F1 how can you not know how to pronounce it.FUCK.
Damn rb managing a disaster of a car and still keeping up to the ferarris. I dont even wanna know what is gonna happen from next week or so when its all fixed
Anyone who understands ICEs and lives where gasoline is poisoned with Ethanol - Like in the US - knows any environmental gains that come with using E10 will be offset by the long term damage to their engine system. E10 corrodes has a higher affinity for water and corrodes just about everything it comes into contact with.
We had more racing today than in the whole 2020 season
Merc and Red Bull has some work to do, gives ferrari a better chance to run away early but they’re dealing with a team whos won 8 straight constructor championships and a team who made a championship winning car last year so who knows 🤷‍♂️
Ethanol is not and never has been greener. The amount of energy  needed to produce and deliver it in its entirety makes it actually dirtier.
Basically you don’t know
Sabotage
Undercut is super strong. Jarno told us.
KARMA IS A BITCH RED BULL.
Max won't win anything this season, poor performance from Carlos today, we should see another lock out next race
Karma's a bitch!
Haha
It was not the same problem in the two RB car.  Couldn’t happen to a more deserving team !! Well done Ferrari !!! Good drive Charles
I am a max fan but hell I can’t be upset of the results today.  Leclerc and Sainz drove spectacularly today a well deserved win for them and the team.
Love it. They’re gonna feel it all season. Karma is a complete and utter btch
This season may become a 3 team fight with 6 drivers. Mercedes will definitely catch up to Ferrari and Red Bull.
Horner’s tears make me happy 😆
💆🏾‍♂️Sainz Champion 2022🧏🏾‍♂️
Max was practically crying on the radio after whining about his tires all race. Guess he's taking Hamilton's complaining to a whole new level after being gifted the championship by Massi. Charles was calm and composed all race, great race, the championship is his to lose.
Wheel to wheel with Charles and Max is how its suppost to be .  No crying , no complaining , no sending emails of rules and regs to the Stewart just the hard clean racing.  So basicly is wasn't Lewis .
Any bad news for RBR is good news to me - are you going to have a video about the FIA report findings regarding the WDC from last year being decided by "human error"?
Now if God will just get rid of the psycho prick Hamilton…. F1 will be a class act Again
So we traded tested fuel loads, for "green" ethanol for only 10% of its make up. a joke man
KARMA IS A HUMAN ERROR FIA BUT GODS PLAN IS JUST🤷🏾‍♂️🙋🏾‍♂️👈🏾😅💆🏾‍♂️⚰️
lots of Mercedes staff went to Red Bull over the last year and a bit. Maybe some are still on Toto's payroll? :D jk
Charles is pretty good. Pretty pretty pretty good.
It was disappointing for Red Bull to run so good all race and to show their immense speed to get bunched up after the caution and then both cars have failures.
I don't anything about aerodynamics, but I wonder if the rocket ship design of the Mercedes actually gives them less down force, or less control over the aero than other cars.  Redbull/Ferrari intakes almost look like two wings vs the the one wing on the mercedes floorboard.  I'm guessing that Merceces suffers in the corners and under breaking but has some pickup in straight line speed.  That Ferrari design is beautiful and also quite functional.
Thanks!
Hahahaha couldn't have happened to a more appropriate team.
At least RedBull has race winning pace.  Mercedes got lucky today.
Wonderful race for Charles and Ferrari. We have known for years Charles had the potential to fight for a title and it’s just about waiting for the team to deliver that car. Now they have.
I was super happy to see Ferrari win and gutted to see RedBull have problems at the very end .
karma is a mf ain't it 😂
I'm just glad it wasn't the PU.. I was thinking both RB's would need new engines.. its just the first race... those redbulls look strong, checo looks stronger than last year.. it'll be alright..
Simply verstappen is not mature enough to see what was the situation its understandable he wanted the win but he complaints where like his team held him back
Great video, but next time, please don't spoil anything about the race in the video title or thumbnail for those of us who can't watch the race live.
Feel so sad for max 1* 🤣  🤣
Red Bull didn't have Masi to help them out this race? Sorry Maxie fans.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They might have run out of fuel. My car doesn't go as far on E10 fuel either, need to keep checking that fuel gauge so you don't get caught out.
Red bull engines are fast but are less reliable and are prone to overheating. Mercedes engines are slower but more reliable. Renault/alpine engines are fairly balanced. And the ferrari engine seems to be the fastest and have stood the tests of an f1 race. At least that's what i can gather so far from race 1. Im sure everyone will make adjustments as they go.
That's a shame
😂🤣Max crying on the radio was hilarious 😂🤣
HAAS ❤️.  👍👍👍👍
instead of making a summary video of what happened during the race the max fanboys who run this channel had to make a video about fishfacestappen and redbull. 2/3 of this video are dedicated to fishface's dnf. meanwhile there were so many more interesting stories to talk about. this channel needs to just admit they are fishface fanboys. the bias at this point is getting annoying
Speed of that Red Bull with DRS was amazing , shame it all went to shit but I’m sure they will win the next weekend
I think Max's brake issues were largely just caused by himself. He was full sending it, particularly into turn one, three laps in a row. He was braking as late and as hard as he possibly could, and at some point the car is going to tell you to stop. That moment happened locking up into turn one at his third ridiculous lunge attempt, and he paid the price.  Red Bull also put too much faith in the tyres to stand up to a few hard laps of pushing fresh out the blankets, and paid the price. Notice after Max took all the life out of his new tyres after only a few laps, when the Merc's pitted for Mediums, they were told very clearly to be steady on the first few laps.  There are a lot of unknown variables this season with so many changes, I think this won't be the first time we learn something about the cars halfway through a race.
We're seeing a champion trying to defend their title and Max....lost his cool, he was never not upset on the radio it seemed and the more he was behind Charles the more annoyed he got. He'll have to keep a cooler head to beat Charles and Carlos, they're both cool customers
Karma is a b
nothing pleases me more than seeing fishfacestappen dnf then the max fanyboys at this channel talk about it. GLORIOUS
Music: Jobii - Zilch  Thank me later
Sainz, Russell. Wonderful finish...
you can tell the Race are so upset that fishfacestappen got a DNF, this channel is the biggest max fanboy channel out there. id have paid so much money to see them cry when he crawled into the pits. WTF1 > The Race.
Any comments by your advisor Gary Anderson about the F1-75?  😂🤡
Karma caused red bulls nightmare long may it continue
What happened with Saudi Arabia 2021 results? What did FIA said about it?
Charles is the best driver on the grid
Go FERRARI
Still feels bad for Mclaren not in the competitive mix, and Williams trailing at the back end. Aston Martin is quite disappointing as well. It seems like teams that uses the Mercedes engines have tanking performance. The consolation is that teams with Ferrari engines are very competitive this time around. Alpha Tauri and Alpine  being at the lower end of the midfield right now, though their pace could suggest potentials for a comeback.
What's happened is that I bet Red Bull has just carried over everything from last year without adapting the engine/fuel system to E10...
Got a feeling mercedes are already being conservative with there engines until they sort there car out. Positioning themselves for later in the season. As they did last year.
Sweet
Elementary: Karma. As for the 2021 Driver Champion (* see Massi) and his claim to roll into the pits I suspect t is RedBullshit. He’d rather a DNF than P6.
Happy to see the red car relevant once again and happy to see Charles in a car worthy of his talent.  But I'm simply delighted with Haas and particularly KMag -- a little more than a week ago he was on holiday in Florida, he get's rehired by Haas, sets P1 on his first day back, and then takes 5th in Bahrain.  This is the combination of car and teammate that Mick needed to finally see what he can do.
I am waiting to hear who will Christian blame for this screw up.
The Ferrari looks lethal  Absolutely killer scorpion
They [Red Bull] may say it was fuel related , but, Perez's car engine as he turned into the corner seemed to seize up completely, and Verstappen's made it back to the pits though slowly, so possibly each Red Bull car failed for different reasons! Next week will tell though I doubt if Red Bull will tell anyone what caused both DNF's hey!
Anyone else thinking of Bahrain 2010? It's scary how similar the situation is, even the Podium is the exact same - a Ferrari 1-2 and Hamilton in 3.
I'm just so glad Red Bull had two DNFs so it got Hamilton on the Podium as it's the least they can do after Horner Requested a Safety Car to Masi in Abu Dhabi to ruin Hamiltons Championship which Verstappen didn't win 2021 Championship on Merrit.
Karma is what caused it, nothing else! 😂😂😂 Serves em right
I was glad to see KMag get that fifth for Haas. Comeback for team and driver.
verstappen and perez deserved 2nd and 4th, its a shame, they drove well. if its this close throughout the season, this might come back to bite max in the long run.
The zero time world champ getting what he deserves
I could say so much, but no. I am not going to ask why the sister car stopped 10 yards away from the stewards position, I am not going to say anything about safety cars over virtual safety cars, and I would not be so based as to say it is good to see cheats not prosper, that would be so uncool. Hahahahahhaha
Verstappen vs leclerc was the best, cleanest and most exciting racing I've seen for quite a while! Too bad it ended like it did but i hope to see more at jeddah
Karma
Corn gas sucks
Max or checo could easily start with 2 DNF. Jeddah will probably be hectic again
I am genuinely pleased for Ferrari and it’s good to see them up there, but man was it hard not to laugh at Horner’s misfortune 😂
nailing your last year rival do not make mercedes looks good stop asslicking mercedes
More like a Karma than disaster,  this won't be the first
Litre for litre producing and using ethanol actually releases more carbon into the atmosphere Over the last year there has been major investigations hoping to find that ethanol was more environmentally friendly
Just excuse after excuse after excuses.  If it was Lewis, you'll would laughing and mocking him. Lol Long live the FAKE CHAMP 🏆. LOL
0 points.....niceee...😂
Not a Max fan but don’t wish this sort of luck on him on Perez. Cars have been pretty solid considering the huge changes that have been introduced. Looking forward to Merc getting back up there and making it a real 3 way fight.
Shell must be the good developer of fuel. Sorry for rb no best gas company sponsoring them
*GP2 Engine*
In guessing clutch fail safety shut down
Odd is, all the and only the Red Bull powered cars had the same weird glitch with their harvesting lights during the race. Both Verstappen's and Perez's lights were going wild during their final laps and I bet it could have something to do with ERS and/or electronics
I would bet that the Red Bull cars just plan ran out of gas.
I wonder if the either ran out of fuel or sucking up air knackered the fuel pump
I loved that battle between Charles and Max, it gave me some Obi Wan vs Anakin ROTS fight vibes.
any chance you guys can credit the music used? shazam is no help and im digging these tracks. or if anyone happens to have the ears of a god
Damn I didn't know that mazepin drove for red bull
Ferrari seem to have got this change to E10 right and now have the best engine/drivetrain package. Notice that suddenly both Haas and Alpha Romeo are competitive in the midfield while the three slowest cars are all now Mercedes powered. I know McLaren have other issues with braking but Aston and Williams are also off the pace. Add in that Mercedes itself is not where they should be and you have to start asking questions of the power unit/drivetrain.
KARMA🤣
Sabotage?  Possibly Software...
A haha hahaha.. So good.. 😂🍻
I'm not even a Mercedes fan, but that felt so cosmically karmic for Red Bull and particularly Christian Horner after all their drama last year.
Didn't RB steal mercedes staffs to construct this engine. Karma.
RB sacrificed cooling for aero?
So glad Charles put such a remarkable display on this whole weekend. He's received so much disrespect after the previous years, I'm glad he's reminded people how intelligent and naturally fast of a driver he really is. A formidable opponent indeed for Max and Carlos!
Couldn't of happened to a better team, Horner is a unlikeable person and I hope it happens again and again to wipe the smug smile of his face. I feel sorry for checo however missing out on his poduim.
I really feel bad for Crash and RB. I really do.
Today didn’t happen. It was just a fever dream. Looking forward to the race tomorrow
The sound has got worse and the cars look terribly slow and gp2 like.. without the fire and safety car and the redbulls braking down it would have been disappointing if im honest..  f1 always make bad decisions
Two things surprised me in this race... Mercedes wasn't really sandbagging, which I thought they were and haas takes P5. All the extra development time and ditching the no talent Russian seems to have worked out!
It was sad to see 3/4 not finishing
Fuel pump
What is the point of mandating wheel covers? Road cars don’t use them except for 18 wheelers.
Fuel issues. . . steering issues. . . brake issues. . . reliability issues. . .  Perfect driver tho'.  Riiiight. . .
Couldn't have happened to a Better team!!
This will be the greatest season ever. No more Hamilton hegemony
Fascinating video about what I'm sure is set to be a fascinating season! Let's go!
When Brits say “La-Clerk” it makes my skin crawl.
Who is Verstappen? Is his name not the Human Error Champion??
Good on RB to give the plastic merc fans something to gloat over and keep their miserable lives happy.
Didn't Red Bull buy the Honda F1 engine program?
Happy for Leclerc. What a race.
Ethanol is not greener.  The carbon cycle related to production is actually more intensive than the old fashioned stuff.  Total life cycle carbon emissions, not just from the tail pipe are higher for ethanol.  Engineering Explained recently did the math that backs that up.  Leave it to government to demand a solution that actually makes the problem worse.
I was so happy to see this man. It felt like karma
only 3 dnf's in the first race of the year is what amazes me
Piss off the fuel put Normal gas in
Ultima Thule remix in the background?
i am quite surprised they didnt stop the race , when max went out . so they could let him fix the car and allow to  restart in 1st place . oh sorry massi isnt charge any more .
Karma karma and karma!
Here comes Red Bull beginning to grumble about Honda.  You were warned Honda, that you would get treated like Renault once things start to go wrong. And just you wait till you experience how the Red Bull bus tires feel, driven alternatively by Horner and Marko, once you get thrown under them.  Oh, and Leclerc and Sainz will really rough up Max this year. I think they both have something to prove; Sainz from their Torro Rosso days, and Leclerc definitely wants to stick it to Max, especially after Austria 2019.
Great informative video- the race was amazing today so excited for the shake ups this season! Would love to see a Ferrari world champion
You can't believe the number of times I checked the channel for a new video After the Bahrain gp , this channel is amazing 🙌🏻
One might say; " it is what it is"
Fun to see as well that the lower tire temps in the tire warmers really effect the out lap this way you will see people exiting the pitlane struggling much more
I think they will have more issues now they have to manage their own engines. This won’t be their last retirement in a championship where reliability is key.
It was the fuel pump, made in Italy...
I don't care what it was, keep it coming.
And myth goes on.Whoever use number 1 in their car,maybe they are cursed by that.
Redbull has nothing for Ferrari. 🤣🤣🤣
Someone must have put a voodoo hex on the RBshitters.  😀
Karma imo
karma
It's going to take a cool head and thinking to patiently "handle" these overweight cars. Not really an improvement in over taking, b/c they are slower to accelerate afterwards, out of the corner. And DRS nullifies the gains, for the other to retake position. The exchange between them was nothing like in the past. And the cars don't "look to race" as they did last year. With the teams that have been out of contention having more time to work on the new cars. Red Bull has done well, and will do even better... DRS must go, for racing as it was with ground effect. Stop "tech-ing" for theoretical excitement...And. RE:fuel, ethanol(alcohol) runs cooler & provides some oxygen. Those are not disadvantages for racing, and can be tuned/timed for advantage. Ethanol has decreased MPG rate. It would be a shame if they simply ran out of gas.
The fact that Max felt something was wrong despite the engineers saying there wasn't is a testament to his understanding and feel of the car. I (as Max fan (but not fanboy) was already saying that Max should stop whining, especially after mocking Lewis for whining so much. Turns out he was right, I was wrong.
1. Ferrari and Red Bull are essentially equal on pace. 2. Pace from Sainz and Perez was really disappointing. 3. Mercedes is miles and miles off the pace. They were 40 seconds off the lead halfway through the race.
It was nice seeing how many times there was battle during just one race just between 2 drivers. Even though I am sad Redbull lost, I am happy that we'll see more on track battles now
Isn't the fuel pump the same for every team? As per regulations.
"HUMAN ERROR"
Absolutely gutted for Max and Checo
karma
It seemed like a lack of fuel issue
Would love to see a video on haas, what theyve developed since their down time in 2021 the car seems strong for midfeild apart from (ferrari engines?)
The fuelsystem from the organization witch are all the same.  Badluck I guess Great racing ferrari and Redbull today
God don't like lairs and cheaters. Redbull 0 points today
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I feel really happy for Ferrari yet sad for Verstappen, he deserved the 2nd place.
Redbull got hacked by Mercedes (unrestricted warfare)  -  either that or they got hit by a directed energy weapon (also Mercedes).
So many more races to come.
Well done Ferrari.  Redbull just had a taste of Karma. 🤣
Can't wait for that McLaren video.
Honestly thought Hamilton took Perez out but yeah...
Where does F1 get its fuel from? Russia?
👑 👑 👑 GOD IS GREAT ‼️ ‼️ ‼️ ‼️ don't drink Red Bull.
Great video , not sensationalized , glad to get away from sky f1  !  Comments are great here too 👍 (apart from a handful )  Well done !
Karama hopefully it happens more often to Red Bull. They deserve nothing.
It's only the first race. 22 races left, RB seem quickest if they get their Balance issues fixed. Considering Max remained about 5 seconds MAX behind Leclerc despite having a poor Balance I cannot image what that car would be like if they had it right. Bahrain is a very unique track so I doubt we'll see total domination like this, but tracks like Jeddah and Imola coming up can tell us a bit more of who is more competitive. I hope Max and RB can come back.
After Red Bull poached key talent Mercedes' engine department, it's ironic to see them make a rookie mistake like not testing enough on low fuel.
Bahrain has been surprising teams for years.
2:33 I think that's not true. In the  German Sky TV Coverage, in an interview with Dr. Helmut, he mentioned that they did do low fuel tests where they run down to a liter. (IIRC) I think it's worthwhile checking this statement again.
It was so great seeing Verstappen lose.
If MAZEPIN was driving a HAAS we would think it’s sucks (edit: not sure how capable it is) but we see it’s quite a CAPABLE AND GOOD car in the hands of a skilled driver.  It’s never just the car at any level.
how sad
Only Ferrari Against Mclaren Took Midfield Fight
I dont think I smiled this much during any of the races last season. Seeing the two Ferraris on top and Leclerc battling Verstappen was simply epic.... and can't say a didn't slightly enjoy the karma of last seasons finale making an appearance when I feared we would see a similar safety car situation happening again.
I'm sad for Mclaren, but the frustration stops me from appreciating how good the race was. I wish it didn't
Fantastic effort
The undercut was very strong... Max was 3.5 to 3.7 seconds behind Leclerc before each stop. That is a lot of time lost .
Guys.. please make video on FIA investigation verdict
Texas justice
Electrical problem after so much used catching Leclerc saw the lights on rear of car indicating problem especially with him complaining about battery and power steering.
Karma?
That 1st place parking spot though, just wow.
Double Red Bull DNF? Fantastic start to the season.   Rooting on Ferrari this year. Anyone but Red Bull and Verstappen.
Delighted for them .. and Ferrari too
I'm honestly surprised that we didn't see more problems from others during the race.
It wasn‘t a batterie problem but a failed fuelpump on both red bull
An rb double dnf is the best result to come out of the weekend. Good to see the return of ferrari and hopefully Mercedes and McLaren get on top of their issues soon too.
They run out of fuel!!
🦀3/4 engines exploded honda is dead🦀
RB's problems are called karma!
3 of the 4 Red Bull motors on the track failed. Not good at all.
Red Bull don't deserve this. They deserve worse.
Love the background music and commentary.  Keep it up…..
Would it hurt you to write "Ferrari Triumph"?
I think gasely may have a similar issue.  As a fan of redbull it hurts but there is hope.  Car looked on pace with both drivers.  Ferrari did well today, whole team was on point.
Initially it looked more like Max chucked a tantrum after he couldn't catch Leclerc and Sainz was gaining on him. If perez hadn't retired too, I would still think that's exactly what happened tbh
Red Bull Powertrains also include the Alpha Tauri engine failure early in the race. Honda gone after last year and only support through 2025. Is it the 10% ethanol added to the gas this year? Who knows? Can't fix bu Saudi next week or Australia on April 10.
KARMA !! Well Ferrari 👏👏🏁 Get in there Sir Lewis 👏👏 What a shame for Mad Max & Red Bull …..NOT🤮
So happy to see Ferrari back. Very happy for Charles but really looking forward to when Carlos wins his first race!
Love it, paybacks a bitch!!!
Amazing performance of Leclerc
Good job Massi wasn’t there. He’d have let them go back to the garage, repair their cars and let them come back out in their original places to fish the race on fresh tyres! 🤪🤪🤪
I think max’s car had an electrical problem, did anyone else see the back lights blinking at different times. I started thinking that something electrical was happening to his car
This will be a crackin' season
E10, screwing up race cars as well as road cars.
Not a single clue. Is the best answer they give 😂🤣 This was a video stating that IT DID happen. Not WHY it happened.  Get it together, guys!
The first issue happened when max said on the radio that there's something wrong with engine braking or the car acting weirdly. I hope its something minor and RB find a solution quickly
Hope Redbull suffers more failures. Would love for Merc to sort out their issues and it be a Ferrari vs Merc season
And Ghasly's red bull engine caught fire causing the safety car. 🤔
Max and Serg are good dudes. I would at least give them something.
The way they shutoff at almost the same time and at the end of the race, probably they just ran out of fuel...
what about Haas and K Mag? thats a REAL underdog story!
🏇🏇🏇
Today has some of the best racing I've seen in years.  So glad the cars can run close to each other again!  I'm wondering if it was the lift pumps in the RBs.  Without the fuel in the tank to cool them, they may of overheated and then finally shut down.  I'll keep playing armchair engineer as my wife shakes her head.  lol
I enjoyed that ending very much. Ferrari is back and the karma angels got their pound of flesh.
What good is green fuel if it makes an engine run hot and blow up?   Then the carbon machine needs to be fired up to build a new engine.
More clickbait from the Race, surprise surprise. Yous haven't a clue what caused the failure
the fia need to ensure all the fuel pumps in these cars are thoroughly tested before next weekend, this will undoubtably strike again

This year we gonna see just how rash RedBull really is. lol
The changes F1 made to the cars make them look like they are much less nimble and less maneuverable  in the corners maybe it’s just visually that they look huge with the bigger tires. 🤷🏻‍♂️
KARMA 101 FROM 2021 safety car expect more DNF Red Bull ...Max Crying a River on the RADIO
1:00 FYI Max’s slow restart after the safety car was due to the steering issue not the power loss. Check the on-board of him having 3 goes getting it round the last corner at the restart
Biggest winner of the day was the Ferrari engine.
Thanks for the spoiler in the title and thumbnail. I’ll resub once the season is over!
It is an interesting start to a season. Such an odd double DNF. If this gets fixed I think they’ll be ok.
What a crybaby Max has been this weekend even before the issues started!
I can’t wait for Netflix to take the “not a concern for reliability” quote from Max’s engineer completely out of context in Season 5
Merc as always lucky!
Charles made Max look like a novice, which he proved by screaming and swearing over the team radio, not what you would expect from a so called  world champion, but he is not
New Honda's reliability came back?
Great start to the season
"contains 10% greener ethanol"  Ethanol isn't green so I don't understand why this switch happened
No way that was just a fuel pressure problem.  Running out of fuel won't lock up the car like happened to Perez.  Nor would it have caused problems with the steering.  Or a fire that nobody wanted to get near for a long time.  No- that was pretty clearly a serious electrical problem.    And it was interesting to hear Max complain similar to Alonso's F2 comments many seasons ago.
Cars where under fuelled to give them more of a chance. I think they both ran out of fuel.
Cars are ugly 😆
Ur quick man. Jeez. Good coverage.
Imagine being told on your last lap "there's not a lot you can do" when you are so close to the podium. It painfully hurts, I would say. Redbull didn't have P1 on cards today, but 30 points were a solid haul. But, Max's bad luck with mechanical failure continue. First steering issue due to the pit-stop error, and then this. I hope they come back strong in Saudi.
Ferrari is BACK!!!
both rb's dnf brought me so much joy
Ever the ones to turn a crisis into a positive, Red Bull are already selling Horner's tears.
I’m pleased for Ferrari that they had the race won anyway
One hell of a day, an incredible F1 race and a great IndyCar race
Fuel pump fail on both RB cars. The fuel pump is a common part made by an "italian" company and supplied to all teams. why the hell are they giving faulty fuel pumps out to the team? seams quit sus cause they are italian tho and RB was the strongest competitor for ferrari. maybe paid sabotage? (i'm just joking).
There are like 6 fisrt comments 😂😂😂
Would love to see a video explaining what happened to mclaren aswell
Couldn't be happier that Red Bull powertrains had 3 cars with issues. Terrible race team with no ethics.
Haasterplan
what a timeline to be in where Haas is 3rd in constructers
Fuel pumps from an Italian manufacturer 🤔😂  Btw it's just a yoke
I’m surprised they fell this hard with reliability
1st
Finally, I was afraid I have to wait until tomorrow for this one
1nd comment! Go Redbull! Go Checo!
Mercedes' EL PLAN

Great race though for fans. Thumbs up if you enjoyed it
Took you guys looking enough 🤣. Can you guys do something on McLaren too?
First, bell is Nice
