My fav meme is with dead pool raised his one leg up laying in his arms🤣 i literally cried laughing all day.. remembering time n again 😂😂😂
Bernie under the dryer.   I never saw that one!😂😂😂😂
What's the fun with rigged power play, the people who saught the chair usually landed in dust, so people who avoided fake usa social media accounts on the first go need a chance, so instead of harris, bernie or warren need a opportunity for the actions done to cure democracy, not for pity of old age or something, but they deserve it, so the previous government got a opportunity to fix their errors and this so called capitalism vs government vs people rigging needs to be neutralized, that's the way criminals are rigging people, all con artists need to be investigated, from trump richy rich to sai baba, as we see the virus attack maybe as a global threat.........
The sea shanty “What do you do with a Bernie Sanders” is the best summation of these memes.
I actually think Bernie would have listened to Forrest. In the 80s he was always asking his constituents what they liked about govt programs, what they disliked, and what sorts of changes they wanted to see.
Sheikh hasina family Holywood selebrity misguided or misinformation my life partner and me 14 years suffering struggling already Australia court Germany my life partner avidence not sense maffia army police bangladesh hope today marriage hand over me UN human rights council today no delayed time President
Why he is not president
Why celebrate an effing Socialist??? He hasn't done am effing thing at all to better society. Just leeches of the tax payer.
Love Bernie ❣️
it became a meme because he wore casual clothing in a formal event 😂 you know, it just goes to show how important clothing is
Legend. Why isnt he the president? :(
https://youtu.be/Esa6j-RW2TA
He is such a wholesome guy
He used the meme on him to help the poor, Bernie sanders was n a living saint and genius.
Ah yes the plot to dodge the embarrassment
I think minorities are used by so called progressives to camuflaje between minorities oppressed. When the reality is they are rich  owners of big banks and corporations.
I m still waiting for my tax return. I filed in March. Do you think is fear? My daughter just turned 13, she hasn’t had one regular school day. She use to be a honor roll student, she used to have stray A grades before the pandemic.  After the pandemic all the poorest boroughs had an experimental hybrid education. Only two days of regular schools. I found discriminatory that other groups mostly rich white neighborhoods have regular classes. Nothing have changed for them, but for us every thing turned upside down. I have a medical debt from when I got sick from COVID-19, but nobody helped me neither at the hospital nor at work.  I started to believe that you only do fight in theory for us. I don’t think any of you really care about the poor that made a sacrifice and donated for you tu represent us. Honestly I have never feel more betrayed in my entire live as I feel now.

Who’s here after the sidemen video
Bernie is such a nice guy. It's sad that he's a socialist
Seth Meyers and Bernie Sanders together... talk about a virus.
Senders is so funny.
Bruh even the US military put him in a fighter
legenderi
A man is chilling and you are laughing at him.
Been waiting for help for moms with kids since 60s.other contries Have help. Please help children and orphans.no dad in the home constitutes they are orphans legally..
i love Bernie. I wish I have the chance to vote for someone like him someday.
Why’s it infamous, everyone loves it it’s wholesome
Bernie look like Malaysian prime minister Dato Sri najib tun razak
He would have been a great and funny president, but Biden will do
“Social Media Users”
I love this.
lol not even that funny😂💯🤦‍♀️
I love that these boomers printed the memes to show them
Haha
Bernie is a legend!!! Love him so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have to correct your title: Bernie Sanders had the best reaction to becoming a viral meme *again
Imagine doing a meme with bernie sanders and bernie himself sees it.
ലെ കുമ്മൻജി : ആദ്യം ഒകെ ഒരു പ്രയാസം തോന്നും.... പിന്നെ ശീലം ആയിക്കോളും..
If you are a Progressive, you need to know the story of Tommy Douglas. Here's a mini series about him. "Canada's Greatest Canadian of the 20th Century".  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9SNHt6lRCE  If you are not a Progressive, then you REALLY need to watch it.
I was rooting for this guy tho .. I was hoping for him to become president
How is this funny
Imagine if Bernie had won, then Biden would of become a meme lol
While attending the University of Chicago, Sanders joined the Young People’s Socialist League, the youth wing of the Socialist Party USA. He also organized for a communist front, the United Packinghouse Workers Union, which at the time was under investigation by the House Committee on Un-American Activities.

Meme
At least Sanders has an awesome sense of humor , to bad he is not president, if that Gad been Trump he would be calling the media and everyone else stupid and ignorant for making fun of him lol .
He is also seen in Kerala tourism
He was in my dream lol.
The hermit
Bernie would have made a great President. He would be headline on every news as President of the United States.
All this says is.. I'm bored.  I'm cold.. get over it
I'm glad to see this. I'm 10000% not into politics but I was curious how he felt about all the memes.  Glad to see he found it amusing/positive.  💚
people wante dhim to win but the party and the media always screws him up...
Bernie was the real star of the show, Biden was just a side character.
Okay, this guys kind if awesome
https://youtu.be/dwoN-FvVEsA
HE BECAME A MEMELILIONARE
Who is this guy?...i m seeing his pic alot on FB...
I'm a conservative, and love these Bernie memes! Great fun! 🤣👍
Such a nice man
Bernie Sanders, besides Trump, has been one of the biggest fire-lighters in the memosphere in history.
Jantal boy 👌👌👌
Imagine thinking Bernie wouldn’t stick your arm full of liquid poison if he has the chance for population control. He’s working with the elite people get real.
❣️ Love Bernie ❣️ ... and the mittens. 😅❣️‼️
Malayali undo?
WOOOOOOOOOOOAH HALF WAY THERE  WOOAH  BERNIE IN A CHAIR! TAKE MY HAND, AND WELL MAKE IT I SWEAR..
I imagine thousands of random internet people asking to buy mittens from her lmaoo
What is it about the picture that made it a meme???
And the maker of those mittens is now out of business thanks to Bernie
I don't get the joke. Someone enlighten me please....
This man is unbothered, king😌🤌
Dunia ta ar kisui nai ki jata nia matamati
:)))))))
All laugh and so on but the person who made those mittens close thier shop.. look it up
No one cares its not that serious Breonna Taylor still needs justice where is the news on that topic not some career politician who didnt do anything sittingnin a chair big achievement where Tamir Rice justice why no news on that
This is Michael Foot......UK Primeminister...rejected for looking like a down and out in the Uk......Bernie Sanders wanted to be President but got robbed like Trump........now he Dreams of conducting orchestra's
We all know Berrnies mittens makes thanos's gauntlet look like a J O K E
Bernie is all goodness! Here are some memes, online for ages, but nobody has seen them yet! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xfd97DWC5ls May they bring a smile to your faces!
I skipped this video until my friend sent this meme
Where can I buy them mittens?
I honestly don't understand the fuss
Bernie 4EVER
Where i can get those warmers
Im so happy stories like this so beautiful mover our hearts. Count with me
This meme alone just shows you how people’s iq went down
I love Bernie
Il Grande Bernie ♥️♥️
He’s sitting lmao 😂 😂😂😂😂😂 don’t you get it he’s sitting in random places xdddddddd
He could make a better president than biden
Mittens
I hate this meme. You cant search Bernie sanders without this popping up. I want to hear his political speeches and not a meme
Usa: a sleeping nation. Perfectly rapresented by him.
Bernie Sanders  should’ve been the next president .  The Democrat party railroaded him again .
Wait why does he look like he’s mad?? Im confused
I really love Bernie !
He does need to up production of the swearsnirts. They were sold out in minutes.
Who cares.  He's another Communist shill.
0:58 That looks real!
Berrnie don’t give a damn
Such a great man for the last 50 years, a real activist and defensor of causes for humanity.....Senator Bernie Sanders is a national Treasure.....
I thought he was buffet🤣
IT'S BERNIE SAMDERS, WITH A STEEL CHAIR
Check out my funny Bernie sanders compilation video
nice warm mittens, poofy jacket ...,maybe even long johns. no doubt Bernie wanted to Feel the Burn...
1000s of jobs being lost and we are talking memes media?
Politics are becoming a serious thing that even memes are involved
I don't get it and it's not even funny, the only thing comes to mind is that global warming is a hoax
Rip Bernie
I’m already laughing lol
...and not looking very excited, neither were the other politicians?????? #strange 🌪️ STORM IS COMING 🌪️
I'm just like, this meme is everywhere. I wish I would 've been awake to see this part of the inauguration. lol
Bernie is awesome! LOVING THE  POSE LOL! ❤
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️
After all those years wasted as a politician only to become an influence at his age.
Para estar casi loco sólo hay qué, estar como éste Sr. Olvidó la caída del muro de Berlín.
Add him next to drummer guy Bilal Göregen
U guys r so  weird   analysing him for sitting peacefully, why.. 🤷 😂😂❣️🤔🙃🙃😄
Bernie that dude
Look At My Man
It could be him..
He to stupid to understand he being made fun of
I'm not into politics, but you make fun of Joe Biden, he will laugh with you. Make fun of trump, and he will try to sue you. Kinda speaks to what kind of people they are. Just sayin
Bernie !
Kalamalaaalalamalalamalamamalamal

Quoted for Truth: Bernie is the *BEST* president the US never had ...
https://youtu.be/9vWhS3EL6XM
stupid
What's shame we have doltin joe, the American hater in the white house
Bern baby bern.
Beautiful Bernie King the world 🌎
What really funny is that he’s too stupid to realize that he’s being mocked.
Go Bernie go....that guy made everyone laugh when we all needing it..he's a great guy overall!
Love you Bernie
Bernie is a smart man, he know mittens keep your hands warmer than gloves ✌
Why does he shave the top of his head and let the sides grow long?
Thanks, now I can follow the meme trends :D
They aren't funny tbh
He is precious. We need him just to do Bernie. Just be yourself Berns. We love ya for it.
Its too bad that the lady who made the mittens went out of business because of taxes.
We don't deserve him 😍
Lol
The person who made those mittens was put out of business because of...... high taxes. The irony.
It's too bad that at age 79, his politics is still too ahead of it's time for USA.
Bernie Sanders would be a much better president then Biden who's giving all the money away to foreign countries
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Love you
i want him to be president

I’m not a Bernie sanders fan but I’m glad he likes memes but of himself.
bernie sanders is 79 yo. biden is 78 yo. so, why they were saying that sanders is too old??
he's adorable ✨
Imagine becoming a viral meme just by simply sitting in a chair.
The lady that made those mittens. She went out of business; she could afford to pay the high taxes 🤣🤣🤣
Sanders, his supporters, love big corporations, big tech, billionaires, etc.   What a bunch of fraudsters
Memes aside, this is just wholesome
Once you see his mask is uncentered you cant unsee it
It's cold in Dc lol
Why do the most miniscule meaningless things become memes? 🙄
More hard hitting news
I'm here to check who is he after watching memes on Instagram
Bernie Bernie Bernie!!!  Could this man be anymore real?  I just adore his "down to earth" personality.  A politician with that quality has to be a one and only.  Bernie you are the epitome of US.  ONE NATION.  Always pulling for the better of ALL.  You are a national treasure.
I'm glad Sen. Sanders can laugh at them...they are lovely. My favorite is Deadpool and Sanders.
Wholesome.
Really weird with huge mittens but no hat at all. Also I hear the lady is now overwhelmed by all the orders for her mittens lol
“Look how they massacred my boy”
Washed up old man of no consequence...
I’m such a Bernie fan girl!
r/madland
The Manilla envelope is a MacBook Air.
More people saw his memes than saw Biden's inauguration
Aww cmon why so many dislikes?
Dillon ka Sadar Bernie ❤️❤️
Reddit
Bernie Sanders Mittens should come to Fortnite Item Shop as Pick Axes
He is the new national crush now
The Itachi one is my favorite
Meme of the year 🥶 🧤
We are happy knowing that we can make cool content for our subscribers 😎
Imagine Bernie actually were our 46th POTUS... all the memes of Trump and all the wonderful human & planet-saving policies of Bernie!
Everyone killing each other over Biden vs Trump while Bernie over here just being wholesome.
Bro can he give us the link for those mittens tho? They look so comfortable
Crazy how people care about Bernie when it’s time for a new meme smh if only everyone was going bonkers for Bernie like this when we were picking candidates, he would’ve won by a landslide 🙄
I'm not Democrat at all, but man, I would so rather have Bernie in there vs. Biden.
They went out of business... taxes too high, which Bernie supports. Ironic, isn't it?
Tiffany Taylor...? dumb name
Don’t say viral...  Its in very poor taste
Great  guy  Made  money  for  a  food  bank  from  the  photo  Mazel  Bernie  your  a  Mench
We all know who could have united the country! The whole country!!!!
тхһ
Bernie you are a goof and a disgrace to mankind.
America needs monument of Bernie Sanders
Does anybody wants breakfast! Guys let's go guys I'm leaving for McDonald's in five seconds!
In the envelope was top secret plans the "juice" shared with him to further destroy America from within.
The Lofi Beats that came out of this have been remarkable
Haha this my fav meme xD
I will never understand why people bring politics into comment sections of videos like this. It's just a video about a meme, calm down.
Biden is illegitimate
Days gone by?
Democrats are the most useless people
Why can’t he be president, everyone dislikes Biden
Bernie has figured out how to get rich with campaign contributions. What a hero.
lol bernie was never meant to be president.more like an old crazy grampa that is so funny to be around.
Cause, this is important. Meme of the day? The week is more like it. Can we focus on the military sleeping in the parking garage with 1, yes ONE outlet and ONE bathroom. Basically sleeping one atop another. Treated like trash. Thanks to 45 he gave them his hotels to sleep in as they deserve.
Hes okay with it. One of the most okayest boomers
He's the goat fr deserves to be the president I only voted for bro if he not running I'm not voting he's been to jail make this man the president
😂👍
How do I get a pair of those mittens?
bernie sanders meme does not change the fact that in Australia there are 48 million kangaroos and in Uruguay there are 3,457,380 inhabitants. So if the kangaroos decide to invade Uruguay, each Uruguayan will have to fight 14 kangaroos.
Gloves and mittens! Mittens and gloves! 🎶 🎵 🎶
My local weather channel made a meme with bernie in it.
Thats a man of the people right there
We could've had Bernie, BUT JOE STOLE IT!
Look when you know the election was fixed but was not fixed for you to win.
He was sitting there thinking, “Trump may know what it feels like to have an election stolen, but he doesn’t know what having one stolen twice feels like.”
Agree or disagree, this is pretty wholesome
Meme is dead now
Our hollywood is just as FAKE as our new fake president. We have so much house cleaning to do this year. I think gitmo will be jammed packed full over evil-doers.
It’s been a couple of days since inauguration and already the meme has been horribly overused... it’s almost more obnoxious to come across than Avengers Endgame memes at this point.  Yes, it’s an extremely elderly, Castro sympathizing, Marxist old man wearing mittens. Hilarious, man.
No one is safe lmaoo
" No Refunds" is another meme of him as well.
The guy who wants 90 percent income tax.
fork u bern
#27 on trending lol
I think Bernie would have been a cool president
While the rest of the attendees at Baiden's inauguration appeared to be advised by FASHION experts, Bernie Sanders, was dressed as if to go to the corner grocery store. It was logical because he represents the American working class. Another sign of his coherence in life is that he sat in a "Regular" chair without any pretense. Of all the politicians in the northern country, Bernie Sanders seems a lot like the former president and wise man. José Mujíca from Uruguay.
We love you, Bernie.
*Tries multiple times to become President*  *Becomes a meme instead*
Bernie stole my heart😘
Did Phyllis make those??
Irony: Mittens made by an individual within the private sector being worn by Bernie Sanders.
im glad he took it well haha
My youngest son, "Josh Josh"  came up with this meme!!✨💛😋
Should have been the democratic nominee in 2016. Idk how anyone can trust the DNC.
He's happy because he has all our money
The envelop he is holding is his  resume aplying for a job after inaguration hahah
https://youtu.be/lueR6Wzt6to
Only nice Democrat
Having Bernie memes to spread the love and affection of his followers is an extra benefit to getting our nation back again. He and Amanda Gorman were the stars of the inauguration.
Commenting so the comments aren’t 666
Somebody show him the others🤣🤣🤣
J
The only politician that is genuinely liked
Bernie is old, but he knows how to perfectly react to becoming a meme
He ,can be , prisedent of American politics
Always nice there's a senator with a sense of humor.
Brooks its me
THE UFC ARM LOCK WAS THE BEST
Funny enough, those mittens that he is wearing came from a woman who just recently closed her business due to high taxes.  The irony.
I have seen socialism when growing up in Russia... elderly people... cold and miserable and all alone.
Love bernie ❤️
Great sense of humour. Keep it going. A wonderful  man.
He probably thinks he will get some money for them.
I thought he was dead !!!
what a great guy
People keep talking about his mittens... you know if you wanted a pair.. you can’t get any. The maker of his mittens was drivin out of business by high taxes. Said it wasn’t even worth it as a side hustle. Little ironic isn’t it? Guy pushing for higher taxes wearing the mittens you made, after your mittens business goes under due to high taxes.
I definitely don't agree with his politics, but got to admit he definitely has a heart.
I’m getting some mittens.
https://youtu.be/mfCBh1y-8-o he made it to the Rogers place 😂
He is no longer asking for our financial support   He is moving on to bigger things
Tf who wouldn't sit and listen to Forrest Gump???????
0:32 the lady in the pink hat had a dumpie
I love this dude hes great and can take a joke really well
neat
Dont like Bernie but love the meme.
LOVE YOU SENATOR SANDERS!
Nothing like working for the kid sniffer in chief.
He's literally just a grandpa vibing
Bernie was the only one who could save America and the left threw him out the door. America will never be free now. Another Bernie isn't coming along anytime soon
It wasn't really *that* viral
Hi
Bernie  was the best  part of the inauguration
Predrag kon ahahhaha
It's like he hasn't aged in 5 years.
I'd have preferred his reaction to becoming President but murica is busted and cant have nice things🤷🏼‍♂️
He was being a typical grandpa haha ❤️
why do people be disliking, he was jus' wearin sum mittens
Lock them up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bernie sold us out all for the $15/min wage Executive order.
Am I the only one who wants to try on those mittens 😂
But hes so cute 🥺❤
This generation is pretty clever yes ..
The homely almanac bizarrely pass because pruner beautifully waste given a homeless priest. colorful, conscious booklet
Now people will have Bernie Sanders in YTPs.
All that is missing is a matching hat to those mittens. Lol!  I love Bernie's spirit!
Seth is the worst
The legend here is the camera man who took that photo...
He got some ballots under there just in case lol
I love you Bernie, just for being you.
He looks like he's ready to tell the children get off my yard! You got to love Bernie
That's the look of someone who had two elections stolen from him by his own party in order to put up Joe " no one likes him" Biden...
Poor old guy been dumpster diving again
Corrupt
Bernie stole the show. Poor Joe.😁
Fox news initiated this about Bernie talking about his bad code of dressing . It backfired an made Bernie an instant success. Love love love Bernie
The woman who made those mittens were taxed out of business how ironic
Wait people watch Seth Meyers?
Is this really news you want news watch news max
Remember folks Bernie refused to vote during the patriot act that’s let’s government track everything we do I know I’m not the only that got “COVID tracking” on our phones
i admit i bought mittens after the meme
This the sort of “reporting” we gonna get from the likes of CNN and MSNBC?! Lmao!
Bernie knows how it feels to have a presidential run stolen right out of his mittens by biden.
Hats off to Bernie for taking bribes to get out of the way of the establishment. Nice new 11 million dollar house.🤔
Nice to see that this is news.. and not biden destroying tens of thousands of American jobs on day one. Always nice to see what’s actually important
He has to protect his CCP overlords best resource.
Enjoy your house in the hamptons for dropping out bernie...
.
Why are here so many dislikes?
The coziness of Hollywood and politicians makes me wanna puke.
It was actually the most honest moment of that secular religion anointment ceremony
I love this guy so much. He could have been our president 4 years ago
Sanders realized the Dems use for him is gonzo ? His 15 minutes of fame are Over ? 🤔
Handmade Mittens . It does sound nice.
A Socialist becomes a Capitalist whilst celebrating a Marxist takeover of a Constitutional Republic. Interesting.
JUST IN ---- Bernie tested Negative again for President.  Thank the Lord.
Class act ❤️🙌
Bill Clinton fell asleep.
Great Response Bernie ..A Star 💥
its great  we can all come together and make this a meme and spread joy and harmless fun :) its those kind of things that make me happy in not so happy times
Became a meme twice, and still not president.
King Of The Sellouts
I want them eco friendly gloves
This is his legacy. Looking like an idiot wearing gloves and no hat. Oh, and having been cheated out of his nomination 2x, right or are those baseless claims?
heh heh  well leaves us with a laugh and a smile i suppose , other than that his a  socialist dick
Biden is clueless on policy. He has no plan for the pandemic, economy or foreign policy. The media isn’t in a love fest with the administration either. Durham is breathing down his neck. His son is under investigation by the DA in Delaware. Unfortunately Kamala is incompetent too
Hey, Bernie... Is that woman that made the mittens still in business? Nope, closed due to high taxes but she still supports you. Just like you supported being robbed twice in Primaries. Birds of a feather...
You were definitely a star of the Inauguration Bernie.  Not only do many of us feel the Democrats stole the election from Trump... we also know that they stole it from you.  Twice.
Where's the meme of him sitting next to Forrest Gump??
Bernie Sanders: “ I’m not laughing at your memes. I’m laughing at our memes 😂😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂”
He is so cute!  The mittens aren't bad either.😃
I love Bernie and this is why😂❤️
To think that this humble, charming old man would have been the president if Dems leadership and the Liberal media didn't gang up against him.
I'm a republican, and I just love Bernie. Lol he gets me tickled I can't help it!
He is single. No wonder sitting alone with no wife. For that he is doing well and independent.
Honestly he would have been better then biden but he's not a puppet
😂😂😂
‏In less than 72 hours, Joe Biden: ‏—Killed 70,000+ jobs ‏—Eliminated women's sports ‏—Invaded Syria ‏—Left the National Guard to freeze in a garage ‏—Admitted he doesn't have a plan to fight COVID ‏—Broke his own mask mandate EO ‏—Ended US energy independence ‏Do you miss Trump yet?
Of course his friend that made them is a "teacher" who would guess that there is a communist "educating" children.
They did not rigg the election for you too bad
Ah. Some funny peaceful news
Hahahaha
He was staying safe from the biden flu
Yep... he's a laughing stock, alright.
Just leave the old man alone, he's 79. **memes are fun though :D shhh**
Bernie: "I'm not laughing at ur memes. Im laughing at *our* memes."
Bernie The man
Who gaf?
He Is the president that USA will never had!
Bernie is evil and therefore not fodder for entertainment.
Bernie needs to go home
Bernie Sanders can't have "best" reactions. He is a fool. At best, his reactions are random.
Bernie Sanders is the Demonrats loyal dog
Bernie is a national treasure 😍😍😍
He couldn't be more appropriate...has to go with the degree of enthusiasm and most importantly the level of Authenticity of the Event!!!😅
The woman that made the mittens is out of business due to tax hungry government that made it not even worth doing as a side job
Sell out
vu fashistu satanistu moshenniki
Nobody takes it in the tail pipe better then Bernie!
I howled at the one with Degeneration X playing poker.  He’s got a great sense of humor.
💙💙Love Bernie so much💙💙
Professional looters alert using EVERYONES WITHHELD ESTATE or bonds of equity to hurt children and make homeless for profit WORLDWIDE. Cestui que vie, commonly known as strawman.
I néed those mittens!
Weekend at bernies
I want to buy those mittens  :)
Could someone please explain what is this about because I don't live in the USA and I don't know
*Meme moment*
Bernie bending over for the dnc repeatedlly  and all he got was a fashion related meme.
Wholesome
Ohhh.!! What a News.🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😂😎 And is called professional Media News.😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂 and that's a Fact.!!
I love Bernie Sanders!! He really is adorable!
If trump is responsible for what happened at the capital. Bernie Sanders is responsible for what happened at the congressional baseball field
I’ve always liked Bernie sanders
This guy wants nothing less than to eliminate the most important incentive to work and work hard:  he wants equal income for all.  He would destroy civilization because no one would choose to do anything productive because it would have no personal material impact.  Why work?  Let's just sit around, getting high, playing video games then collect our weekly check.  Bernie Sanders and his supporters are disgusting and no accolades should be shown to him at all.
So much important stuff going on and this is what  they choose to focus on
Again disgusting story!
Lol poor Bernie. This is what the DNC and MSM think of him. Old mitten boy.
Thats why hes name is Crazy Bernie.
I just love the "top secret" remark. So much better than a vanilla "it contained some documents from my office".
Ironically, the woman that made the mittens had to go out of business because of outrageous high taxes. Even more ironic, Bernie advocated for even higher taxes than that. A perfect example of the pure idiocy and hypocrisy of the Democrats. And now they use the picture as a meme and celebrate it, ignorantly not even understanding the irony of the situation.
Since America has always been racist and the new mantra is to teach American history was evil racist white supremacy there is nothing left to defend patriotically or culturally. Cancel the 4th and tear down the monuments as ISIS would have it? Bernie prefers communism and everyone in their place per edict of state?
VOTER FRAUD EXISTS !!!!!
😂 Someone at an art group painted this...so thats where they got the reference It looked so cute too lol
It’s was a cold day that day there too.
i love this #Bernie4L
Read comedy of coffin on kindle......
So cute :) Love Bernie!!
I love the one when he scares Trump, lol
Refresh my memory. What’s one thing that he’s done?
Ironically the teacher who sells those mittens had to stop due to the taxes being too high to sustain meaningful profits. Funny picture tho.
i dont really see why the Bernie meme is funny, i just think its funny how far everyone is going with it.  can someone explain to me why its so funny?  am i missing something? idk maybe im just old lol
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpUPuSrdLJU
That's where I live!! Woot woot Vermont!
I just love him, he is one "real" person which seems to be very very rare in the USA. Somebody you can trust, not a damned showman..
too bad the lady who made his mittens went out of business because of high taxes 🤷‍♂️
I wonder how many hats he'll get?
I will always love this man, he has one of the greatest of hearts.
Bernie should have stayed warm at his beach house & skipped the inaugural.
I love Bernie Sanders
could those mittens be the path to the white house?
"infamous"? nah... "fabulous"
I wouldn’t vote for Bernie but I have to admit, he’s a really cool guy with a great personality
🤗👍😁
Bernie is the man!!!!
Shame the policies he supports run the woman who made those mittens business into the ground..but hey at least he's warm.
Overwhelming mitten attention.
Bernie got robbed. Nobody wanted Potato Brain.
They stole the primary from Bernie Sanders, because he would not have been a puppet
I disliked the video because I heard Biden’s name
When your more popular than the guy actually getting inaugurated
Yellow Journalism
In today's news,..................Bernie smiles.
Ironic this is the highlight of the day... nothing to see here move on..  totally legitimate election.....
We love you Bernie! ❤️🤗❤️
His mittens were made by a Vermont constituent.... can Bernie get any more fricken adorable??
Stole the nomination from Bernie. Then stole the election from T r u m p.
The lady who made these mittens had to close her business because federal tax made it not worth her time.
Thank you for this Bernie, we need some laughs and smiles this year starting.
Just going to place this here and hope the left will learn some day!    https://youtu.be/T3PaqxblOx0

I love the story of his mittens and that he would wear a gift from one of his constituents. He has a grateful soul.
Him and Bill should have sat next to each other they both looked like they were sleeping
Bernie is so unbothered..and REAL
❤️❤️❤️
Bernie has always been sort of a joke
STOLEN ELECTION = FAKE COUNTRY
I love that man Bernie all day🥰✊🏾🇺🇸
Don’t like socialists but at least Bernie can speak eloquently.
the elites fawning over each other is very comforting 🤮
Best "loser" of all time.
I would rather look at his mittens anytime over that ugly ugly purple clinton hand me down outfit that kamala had on for the inauguration.  She not only plagiarize speeches she copies outfits from clinton. I am not sure  Where the stupid, hideous  cackling  of  Hers comes from.
Why Bernie is always adorable?
I wouldn't mind listening to Forest Gump.
too bad his liberal policies make sure that women cant sell those mittens 😂😂
I want some of those mittens😳
Colder than a guillotine. Master of so many memes.  His only jacket? it's green. Mittens made with love in the seams.  Shows support with sweatshirts, feeding people like an expert.  Budget is on task, who needs to ask.  Hardships overcome, like chewing bubblegum.  Peace
He is a class act and America’s cool Grandpa
What a bunch of stupid people.
I woulda voted for Bernie but no the Dems are so corrupt they made that impossible
Bernie is cool as ice...  even in those toasty warm mittens...
mittens sanders
Bernie for president
I totally dig those mittens! I want a pair!
❤️you Bernie!
Term limits pls!
We commit treason hahaha let's Make a joke out of it y'all are idiots
Even Bernie was cheated by his own party twice and he was ok with it.
Thanos: I have the Infinity Gauntlet 😈 Bernie: Mittens of Wrath 😪
* Bernie before being a millionaire * *"Millionaires and Billionaires should not exist"* * Bernie after being a millionaire * *"Billionaires should not exist"*
Awwwwwww I love Bernie he’s such a cutie
The "Hey buddy, can you spare some change look"  Awsome.
This weak man worries more about what you think of him than any really achievement. Extremely passive/aggressive.
At least he has a sense of  humor lol
Friggen pathetic.
he needed a hat.
Lol the dems left him out in the cold. Poor Bernie....
I like his wind breaker actually
he will run for president till the day he die and even after death he will try again because that within the democrat party is legal
You can trust her—she’s a doctor. In a way.
Bernie Bolshevik Sanders
This guy is great
Hey! He's from Vermont. He knows how to keep warm.
The J-Cole album cover was 🔥 🔥
Love him 💗 Take care of yourself Bernie!
Bernie Sanders is a national treasure
Bernie  The only cool person in all this mess  Need laughs
I love Bernie 😊💗
Everybody else was phoney and scripted. Bernie was chilling.
This is the most interesting news I've seen in months
At least he's happy and laughing! I love his mittens!
The pokemon go memes are pretty priceless
He was the poster boy of why socialism always fails. Remember the Wendy's commercial of the Russian fashion show?  And you want a socialistic government?  Come on man, wake up!
We love communism!!! It’s so cool!
He is a coward and a crook
The lady had to close her mitten shop from over regulation.  YOU CANNOT MAKE THIS STUFF UP!!!
Yes at least his meme stayed extremely tasteful. Unlike all the memes of trump. Not as funny but definitely tasteful.
I love him.  He should have been the one being inaugurated though.
Today it makes them laugh, tomorrow it will make them cry.
He needed a hat to go with the mittens.
Bernie Sanders. The greatest president America never had.
Long as we can cheat anyone can win.
Check out Newsmax or NTD news or OAN news or Fox news for a fresher point of view.
Sellout Bernie.
Crazy how this is being talked about while hunter biden and joe Biden are destroying america
This is why America is getting soft. One big joke.
Bernie seems really happy 😃
Funny when the guy is a millionaire dressing like he's homeless... fake as f
President biden!? 😆 😆 😆. Not likely. Dude can't even get a sentence together unless hes whispering creepily in kids ears. Hope family gets what they deserve. Prison time
...am I the only one seeing a seriously sick human being who need help?   Wake up everyone! For the love of the country,  look past the mittens!
READ why Biden should be impeached !!!!🤷‍♂️ why not. They would. Fair is fair.  For abuse of power during Obama's term for giving his son a seat on the Chinese board. A seat his son otherwise would NEVER of obtained on his own. No prior experience...magically obtained a seat on the highest Chinese board for the  Industrial refinery.
Gen z will get him into the White House if he’s willing and his health allows him to in 2024.
The President we needed but we don’t deserve
Because they all know he cheated
I love that man!!!
Hey Bernie, how much money do you think you'll make off this? I bet it's nothing compered to what Hillary paid you
Bernie defines the need for term limits.
He was carrying "The Communist Manifesto" in Pig Latin. Makes for interesting reading.
Bernie Sanders, the People's Superhero... and yes, we'll obsess about him long after he's gone, just like every other Superhero.
Disgusting to see the illegitimate president as the Potato in chief ... China puppet we hate you.
Love it!
❤👈🏾
The official mitten of Socialists of America
Bernie is opening up a new fast food restaurant where every thing is free because the next guy in line gets the bill.
Is no one going to talk about Pepe being called a racist symbol? 😂 the crap msm pull ... no more orange man bad, so they have to get creative.
He was comfy 🤗
❤️ him.
Sanders And COMUNISM are the same this country have a big plague of COMUNISM
What happened to his wife. He needed a hat.
Bernie got more likes than sleepy Joe!!🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡
Freedom is the religion
How to distract the idiots...talk about Bernie Sanders
Bernie inadvertently gave use some much needed silly humor.
Love love me some Berrnie freakin Sanders !!!!!   You da man dude ..... just sayin .....
I love Bernie!
I love Bernie, except for the fact he is an open socialist. But this was great! He's always been a great sport!
Bernie should be President.
Well dressed for the occasion of cold weather.
He's a socialist, therefore he's inherently evil. What more is there to him?
I love ur mittens u cute lil kitten
Looks like he is in the waiting room about to get a colonoscopy
A nation that is too easily amused.
Love you Bernie 😂💕
In the world I wanna live in, Bernie would have just started his second term as President.
Who cares
Bernie, go back to your mansion and retire instead of stealing our money with your Gumby back bone
What I like about Bernie is that Bernie is Bernie ... take him or leave him.  He's the real deal and has been a consistent politician (in his platform) for decades.  We need more like him!
The Roman's use to pay other countries to not attack them. Then at the end the Roman's gave money to the people. That's when the Roman's fell and lost.  #historyrepeats USA is falling to other countries who might attack us
With trump gone start the fluff pieces.
Bernie!
There you go everyone Media deflect from policies, bills, and laws. That will effect your lives. Saying everything is fine look at Bernie's outfit
No acepto ver en la Presidencia de los Estados Unidos a dos usurpadores,  Kemala Harris y Biden.
MY MAN SANDERS: the ULTIMATE STRAIGHT GUY. LOVE you, Bernard!
Ya gotta love Bernie. Thanks for the light hearted vid.
Just like the rest of the US
Hats off to Bernie for wearing big mittens and no hat !
he was suppose to be our president but got cheated by the corporate dnc, ,sad
Nice.
Democrats are just plain trash.
He looks like my a litter cat!
My nickname is literally Bernie
ALL OF THE ELDERLY PEOPLE (62 and older) need to RETIRE.
I quit my occupation because of that here look on the web this  *g r e a t e a s y p a y*
Bernie is awesome!!! Joe gave him the right job.
He's a meme alright...
POS
Poor Bernie, he realizes the CCP has no role for him.
Such a cool dude.....feel the bern!!!
I saw one for Gordon Ramsay
I like the one of him in front of a medicare sign.
Sanders ( what a loser ) ☺😄
Who cares why does this matter
It was no top secret. He had an appointment at the DMV right after the inaguration. Inside the envelope were his Birth Certificate, proof of address, proof of identity, and his social security card.
What a wet noodle
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Beijing Biden is a Fake President
At least Bernie got a sense of humor, unlike the fat orange man. He can't handle the truth.
He is gay I have video of him that is really bad
See Bernie, you wearing that ladies mittens is the best marketing ever, now theyre popular and she can sell tons of them. Thank you for proving capitalism works bro😂
And what exactly was supposed to be "the best reaction"? That he chuckled slightly? That he said he had no idea the photo had become a meme? I'm not sure how people expected him to react, but there was nothing all that special about it at all.
Glad Bernie has a sense of humor. Love the memes!
Bernie was just another victim of the Democrat Dominion theft.
Hamteamck had fun with it
LOVED it
Who gives a flying............
Marxist
He stayed home didn’t he?this might be fake news story
A hero who is devoted to this country- with or without "celebrity" or winning the ticket.
Have you seen bernies mansions or womansions?
Wonderful communist
The media's idea of a meme is cringe af. I don't see anyone making a big deal out of this besides the media.
Don’t worry Bernie...you’ll be very warm where you’re going!!
What the DNC did to Bernie in 2016 and 2020 was just wrong.
democrats disaster is happening
*Starvendor* on Telegram was so great he got me my cashapp transfer along with paypal,more big deal man and I really appriciate a lot
I love bernie sanders😁😁😁
MORE POPULAR THAN JOE!
Hopefully the mitten lady will start making those mittens for all of us. Ill be her first customer 👍
Bernie Sanders wears recycled sweaters as Mittens Biden wears recycled little girl underwear as a Mask
Bernie is real 4 the people
Bernie Sanders is honest  politiker, He is hero!
Looks bored and cold.
Bernie is a legend
Oh my gosh!!!  How clever!!!!!
It would have been much better if it was a gif of him having a jerry nadler shut down.
BERN
Boycott Communist media
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He is the ''Elvis'' of politicians, popular all over the world. NOTHING proves how fraudulent is our system (in the hands of the two party crime cabal) than that with the his huge popularity, he never had real chance at being president.
BIDEN STOLE THE ELECTION.,..,,
Love Bernie, our best politician
Plot twist: The woman who sells the mittens makes millions of dollars and Bernie calls her an evil rich person and takes all her money as taxes and she starts voting republican. 🤣😷🥶
Protect this man at all costs
not to be dramatic but ✨i would die✨ for bernie
We love you Bernie!
Bernie for President!
👌☺️☺️😂🤣
