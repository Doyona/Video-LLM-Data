REMNANT?!?!

18:41 "The animatronics have taken another victim (referring to himself)"  Matpat also being Toy Bonnie in FNAF Movie 2:
i dont like the way mat says meet GOOGLE MEAT
Watch this before you see the fnaf 1 movie
Technically he killed 6 children because of cupcake
That's Because Mr Cupcake Is Possessed By Susie's Dog...🙄🧁🐕
I loved watching you in the movie. Such a cute cameo for all the die hard fnaf fans!
I miss you matpat😢 we miss you we all miss you matpat please come back to YouTube and bring your kid too we will a door him ❤
1:15 I honestly don't know. Looking back on it, I wasn't much for lore then. Lore just kind of grew on me. Rewatched the movie so decided to rewatch these as well. Miss you MatPat
mat pat making sure that kid never gets another job in movies
Actually in the wall of drawings, if you look at the main one look at golden Freddy, you can that the head is glued on indicating that there’s two spirits in golden Freddy, and that means someone glue on the replacement head. It’s very hard to see, but if you look really, really close, you can see it.
bro your in the movie
arent  there 2 kids in golden freddy
Its mad to hear him acting like he doesn't know the movie's plot 🤣
15:31 his striped shirt reminds me of the puppet or crying child or Charlie or whatever
Why is this theorized plot better than the actual plot???
If u look at the security camera from  the movie it says 2009 u think
14:15 it was difficult to put the pieces together
This aged poorly
This aged badly
W w why te jumpscer
I imagined that controlling an animatronic is almost like controlling a player model, so cupcake and chica are the same
ehh well they got the theory for the twist being an identity of a character right, the puppet being garret was the twist i think
Plot twist:MatPat is actually in the fnaf movie and already knows what will happen
robux
Therapist: MatPat jumpscare isn't real, it can't hurt you.      MatPat jumpscare:
I watched this after seeing the movie and im surprised of how many things you got right😂
It’s 2025 and He wasn’t far off
Can I add, Lucas grant sends a PURPLE Demon emoji
7:17 "You meddling Theorists!"  - William Afton, 2023
Bro Was Right and its scary😱😱😱😱
I have a question So when William was about to speak Micheal last name I thought wait was Micheal his Micheal Afton  let me rephrase that Micheal had a son and named him Micheal and changed the last name so He wouldn’t find out as William cheated and had Venessa with a different woman who was not Miss Afton so Than Micheal died had Mike Jr and also Had Abby and a son
1:10 I missed it until 1 year ago my friend told me about FNAF
Its supposed to be used to transform people into animatronics MATPAT! 2:59
The ‘IT’S MY TURN’ kinda teases his appearance as Ness.
I have a theory...... Ya see.... I have a question. Why was the Ella suit just.... THERE? Clearly it used to have a use for Fazbear Entertainment since it's suit, right?
I think Garret is the crying child
Well…he was certainly right on some fronts. Which is already better than some of his other FNAF theories!
CARROT!!! (car drives away)
Why did mat turn into a demon at the beginning 😂🤣
I clearly have so much to learn😅
Actually you're the first guy to actually get me into fnaf before you talked about it I had no clue about what's
rewatching all the theories and i just had an idea! when matpat mentioned chica’s cupcake moving independently of her and wondering how that works, i had the thought that maybe it’s not her or another kid doing it — what if it’s her dog? since the girl who becomes chica — suzie — lost her dog, i think it’d make sense for them to find each other in death and for them to stick together. also, the fact that suzie had a dog and chica is the only one with a little companion, it makes sense
Like this comment if you’re whaching in 2024
I did not know josh hutcherson played mike…
I could probably see every gametheory and filmtheory fnaf video and i still wouldnt understand the game. And my friend already tried telling me the basics. Maybe my brain cells are jus that slow-
I need I scene where mat pay is a character named ness at a restaurant called sparky’s
6:48 That dave poster....
MatPat making this video knowing he’s in the movie
The movie exceeded my expectations I just got it the other day and I love it and can't wait for part 2 and beyond
I despise google meet
It's almost a year omg
Five nights at Matpats when
huh, it actually ended up taking place in the year 2000
He knew the entire thing he was in the movie
I saw you in the fnaf movie that was a pleasant surprise
When I was watching the movie I was thinking the same about Garett being one of the Animatronics and I was thinking he would save the day at the end. Maybe in the next movie? He has to be in the animatronics because where would be the body then? Or is he alive? But there is a problem about the cupcake. The cupcake can't hide a body.
I hav the cook book!
So close
At first, I thought the kid who you thought possesses the cupcake. I thought he was possessing that old endoskeleton or shadow Freddy
matpat you _swine_ (affectionate)
I can't believe I'm about to say this......    Zoom is better then Google meet
I’m really glad that none of my friends know what Fnaf is all that well because then my birthday would get overshadowed
The intro to the movie was so sad 😭seeing the kids be plucked one by one to their death on pixels made me so sad 😭
Ok so who told whoever made the script (because matpat had the script because he got a cameo) what happens
The fact that they were so spot on with the movie
How Did He Get It Exactly Correct 💯 😮
Mat pat come back please 😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😥😥😥
The fact that matpat tries his best to make as much as an accurate prediction/guess on movies is just so good .We should be thankful for the things he did to us
Matpat was actually right 7:17
Watching this after the fnaf movie’s release and looking at the stuff they were right or wrong about is so good
why does almost video has a sponsor  to make it  annoying
Ok, i have a theory!! :00 What if... Nebraska is where Mike and his family went that fateful day, and where Mike's brother was kidnapped!? (when seen in his dream I assume it's like a camping ground or a park/picnic area or something, maybe a hiking trail? a national park maybe?)  Perhaps Nebraska is somewhere that reminds Mike of his brother, maybe they went there a lot as kids and where Garrett was eventually abducted from. Mike has the poster to remind him of that day as he seems to replay it over and over each night. Mike seems to be trying to remember things, possibly clues as to who took his brother/ what happened to his brother. He constantly replays that day,  haunted by the incident, guilty that his brother was taken and that he couldn't help save him.   However, I assume Mike and his family would have to be on a picnic/trail located near the fnaf location for William to have been the one who kidnapped Mike's brother. So this does make it seem unlikely that Nebraska is where Garrett was kidnapped ( though it could still be a place they frequented as kids.)   So, this does contradicts my theory on Nebraska being where the incident took place.   I do think it's an interesting theory, though I doubt William would follow Mike's family all the way to Nebraska just to kidnap his brother... unless.. He already had his target set on Garrett! :0 Just speculating, maybe William killed out of his own state so he can continue to live his double life, I suspect Mike's brother is special, perhaps William's first victim !! He did get that look of recognition when he realised who Mike was, and seemed immediately intrigued, even excited to see him? (as he would have realized it's the older brother of his first victim, Garrett!)     I haven't seen the movie since it came out so I might be forgetting things, let me know what you guy's think! :D
I don’t scary. I just love it and I would miss it if somebody wore to get rid of the whole game for it and I would cry in my bedroom the whole entire time I’m alive cause I love this game. I’ve seen my brother play it and it’s scary, but I don’t think it’s scary.
1:10 never knew abt it until I heard the living tombstone looked it up and know I’m here
I new it was fake when he didn’t mention spring locks
wow, you got that on the first try. and you didn't even watch it yet
Gareth is golden freddy
People who are watching this 5 months after the fnaf movie came out 👇
The Reason he knew this is he was in the movie
ooo the first jumpscare scared me
I miss matpat😢
The FNAF movie is finally in dvd! Anyone excited?😊😊😊
Matpat: how would you somehow missed the fanomanom that is fnaf tell me you're secrets. Me: well i was born the year fnaf was released and was not introduced yet
the fifth child is indeed golden Freddy, susie ( the kid who posseses chica)’s dog posseses cupcake
The trailer reveals all that?!
How do we know Matt didn't watch the movie before it released though?... He had a few lines, so he could have went to a watch party.  You were mostly right though.
This looks  like  an  interesting   story 🤔 👀 😳 😄 😀 😅 🤔 👀 😳 😄 😀 😅 🤔 +×%&$%&^",$@@!@^&_=%*
The   chan  saw   👀  is  scary 😨 😳   bro    Mr  Falm   there  it's not  like  that   that  gives   me the   hebejebes
Finally saw the movie. Cupcake is definitely a dog.
Not gonna happen 🙅‍♂️
My theory for the freddy head is that it’s just a spare freddy head, the animatronics still put you in a suit and the saw parts are just the mechanism working
After watching it and seeing the plot of the movie, before I even watched anything on it I KNEW it was a different universe, just like the books and the games.
tasty mee
Is fun to see him trying to pretend like he doesn’t know everything
Game theory noooooo! Film theory yes now you should retire I'll steal everything you have
😂nhe thought cupcake is a human cupcake is a dog
The 5 kid is gole in freddy and mike brother is the cupcake🙃
He knew the ending. He was throwing us off 💀
Chica is possessed by Susie and the cupcake could have been possessed by her dead dog, thats why in fnaf 6 we see Afton behind her saying, ''He's not dead, follow me,'' Afton killed her dog. 15:33
Pls do a theory on the boy in the reflection
The fact you’re in it
Matt, I’m 99% certain that the “Nebraska” poster is a “Bruce Springsteen Nebraska Concert Tour” poster. It’s the same font & kerning, roughly the same colour scheme (given the lighting, it’s tough to tell), and the right layout (Springsteen’s name at the top, b&w photo in the middle, ‘Nebraska’ on the bottom).  The song is a first-person retelling of the real-life story of Charlie Starkweather and his 14-year old girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate. Starkweather was an executed spree killer, and Fugate, depending on which account you believe, was his hostage or his accomplice (a ‘Stockholm Syndrome’ scenario).
What if Abby is Cassidy? They look alike, and their personalities kind of match.
Think about cassie an abbey
Matt, aren't you leaving YouTube? Are you going to at least going to leave your videos on the algorithm?
CUPCAKE IS A DOG
Pov me who missed it and now found it on SML:😂🫥💀
You were in the movie matt
Garrett is ballon boy
18:47 that meme
18:17 I feel like that very more of a lot of sense, because she was trying to get shoved in a animatronic suit that looked somewhat like baby
What if the wall of pictures is the reference to the room of sticky notes or the best day ever?
Vannesa is Williams child
At 15:28 I KNEW IT I SHOULD STAY WITH MY GUNS!!!
stripped shirt woulda had me thinking puppet
this makes me want to watch the movie more than the trailers did
If you like God like this
Yooo he got it right
Matpat you're pretty off😂 but still, if the movie was how you said it was, it'd be a very good movie 😁
Not to be mean but the break in doesn’t happen first and the baby sitter dies so that’s why she’s there🐻🦊🐤🐰🧸🐇
Well when the movie came out you were wrong Matpat
Ok.
Can you make a video of how to make a game movie?
i think the reson goldie is nice to abby  is because it garrets soul inside helping his sis think about it..
how did mat have the entire script of the movie in his hands but still got iit wrong lol.
He has a striped shirt
1:38 Correction, dear MatPat... Ninety-three videos... Ninety...Ninety-three?!
FOOD THERIE IS REAL
MatPat, YOU NEED AN APART ACCOUNT FOR FNAF THEORIES
When I was a kid, Zathura scared me enough to leave the theater, Josh hutcherson (Mike Schmit) was the lead role. Now he's back as an adult in a movie scaring kids. It's a full circle.
I feel like fnaf will continue being my favorite franchise for awhile. Mainly because it can't really be "solved". Scott's never gonna come out and just hand the story to us. This is how franchises like this stay alive as more theories and games come out. There's a lot of franchises like this and I love it.
Do you spoiled it?
If Mike golden Freddy then what happens to the another kid that we thought was golden Freddy?❤️
I'm so happy for you being in the movie! You really are very important person in the fnaf history!
I love watching this video after watching the movie and knowing what matpat actually got right and whats wrong
Crazy how he predicted over 90% of the movie without even watching it soon people will stop saying detective sherlocj and start saying detective matpat
THE SECRET IS OUT, YOU WAS PLAYING AS A FREDDY IN THE MOVIE!
Vanessa was kidnapped by Afton and raised as his child because he missed Elizabeth so much.
Sponsor skip: 11:13
when will you do another one on the film fince the movie is out?
0:53 claim it as his own… Oh yeah, he really did (kinda)😂
a
I just realized.... Garrett is the youngest child of the three. Mike and Abby too. Three kids, remind you of anything? The Main characters name is MIKE! And Abby is an anagram for BABY. Connecting the dots?
Bro made a whole theory acting like he didn't have an actual copy of the script in his hands
Apr 7 2015 me bday
You posted this on my birthday😂
0:50 was mad funny 😂
I have a theory that Matt might make money off of these videos…
Mat spoiled most of the show on accident.... Surprising how correct he is with only one trailer
Actually the cupcake is possessed by a dog and Garrett is like the crying child and blonde boy is Cassidy and in the games Cassidy and crying child are both possessing golden Freddy so it’s like the game lore I guess?
It’s actually been over nine
13:41  “Into the pit, I must admit! For youu.”
android is the best
Golden Freddy is fredbear soooooo Even could be the soul of golden freddy
The 5th kid is probably the puppet or G Freddy
Watchinh this after seeing the movie it becomes slightly clear that he saw the scripts prior to this 😂
Wait I just realized FNAF is almost a decade old
I have Google meet so I can FaceTime with my friends who don’t have iPhones
Who was put in sparky.
I personally thought the blonde kid was maybe the puppet at first (notice the stripped shirt).   I do buy into the theory others have said recently that Cupcake is the lost dog that Afton lured Chica away with. Its actions and behavior seem rather dog like.
I am genuinely surprised how much his friend got right
nicely said , Mattew Patrick
I noticed that you were in the fnaf movie
So much forshadowing in this video since mat is in the movie
Honestly super close on a lot of points, and solid on many others, nice
Matpat cupcake is chicas dog
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
SPOILERS ALERT!!!!! You guys know that Matt Patt is in this movie right!!!!... lol just watched this movie and seen him in it.
Matpat  the theory you said if the boy in yellow/ Cassidy was possessing Carl the cupcake why when he took Abby/baby why was he with golden Freddy  and Carl was no where to be seen??
I think the boy or the girl in the stripped shirt is the puppet because puppet has stripes
Why do I always think he is gonna say, G A M E  T H E O R Y ! !
My theory is Vanessa is actually Elizabeth Afton because soon as Vanessa say *"That's my dad"* to Steve aka William Afton that got me thinking if Vanessa is Elizabeth Afton
9:15 to 11:02 is funny if you hear “meat“ instead of “meet“
I’m super late but I thought it was the Freddy suit cause in fnaf 1 phone guy says when they catch you they stuff you in a Freddy suit and I think that’s the suit
15:24 bro has officially lost it
Then th that means Abby’s Lizzie/Elizabeth
So I never heard of you till my kids made me watch the movie and they pointed you out! Glad they did love your videos!!!
Nebraska was when his brother got taken
I never knew why I my resume was never responded to until now... it's because I have an iPhone isn't it?
Right lads here's my theory buckle up. So you all know the security gaurd called Bob who dies in the opening scene to torture freddy well in the movie we see a shadow freddy costume in the background and I always believed shadow freddy is possessed by a security gaurd so connect dots bob the security gaurd possess shadow freddy in the sequel, max is in the costume correct but I think Scott cAWthon did this to fool us similar to how he didn't put foxy in fnaf 1 game trailer he'd hiding is from us this is my theory what do you guys think?
Not much to solve when it’s all laid out in front of you
Plot twist: the cupcake is chicas dog
I'm so glad you wound up in the movie even if it was a little part. And i'm glad your here to talk about everything, I hope your in the next movie as well!!!
What if at the end of the movie they should have done this for like the end credits scene he could be at the restaraunt with like papers figuring out stuff and he ia filming a video and he turns at the camera and he is says “but its just a theory a fnaf theory”
I heard that fnaf 2 movie will have matpat and markplier as night guard
I don't think the kid is the cupcake, I think that instead of a kid it's a dog. Because most of his acts is biting,jumping and running around the halls attacking everyone. It could be chicas pet dog that died with her or that she stuffed in when she was able to possess the suit or the william dragged down both of them and stuffing bothe the dog and chica inside the suit.
Just watched the movie and I think how he really knows all this is that he had a tiny part in it
The golden freddy kid is the kid who was the bite of 87
I was one of the weirdos who had never heard of FNAF before the movie came out. I just saw killer Chuck E Cheese dolls and said yes, then enjoyed it greatly.
1963
A💀 fred 👇🏽 bear 🤢 from 😑 a 🤯 ned 💅🏽 bear😵 4:34
how does he do this he predicted the eitire movie
"strap in el chipo!" i told you not to call me that
there was a happy ending
We need a New film theory episode, i mean the movie is out so there some things that are wrong and maybe some maybe be new or better to solve
Garrett is The puppet
That “ohhh my sweet stars, what have I done” had me tearing up. It was funny 😂😂
How do you not forget this hole thing.
bro my cats name is chika😭
the 5th kid is the pupet
Fnaf is so good to the point my classmates (who’ve never heard of it) were in LINE too play it on my phone.
I literally got an ad for the FNAF movie while watching this
to think Mike spent ten years of his life dreaming the exact same thing to catch his brothers kidnapper, when he could’ve just checked garrets twitter comments 😂💀
Did you know at the end of the credits there will be a distorted voice spelling "out come find me"  Edit: I have a friend which doesn't know about fnaf like how?
So Susie (chika) has a dog and William killed it too so it makes a lot of sense the dog to posses cupcake
Hold up you’re telling me that the FNAF series takes place right in my backyard? That’s actually crazy
15:08  matpat I need what your on.
Feel like we all just glossed over the fact that Matpat basically stalked a child actor for this… 😅
I think the reason this theory was so spot on is because matpat, as someone who is in the film, has the script, but he altered his theory to also have some incorrect parts
I heard cupcake was a murdered dog.
imagine being murdered, cut up and placed in a cupcake with eyeballs just to be held by a bird with a bib and you just jump on peoples faces. couldn't be mr cupcake.
I have a feeling this unknown 5th child is actually the victim of the bite of 87 and the animatronic that caused the bite would be a yellow bear that I like to think is going to be called Goldie fazbear
Hello Ness
This episode is even funnier when you now know MatPat didn't write it.
I am so glad I watched the movie before this, there should be a spoiler warning on this thing.😂
no shi sherlock you worked on it , sorry  matpat i love you but , NO SHINSHERLOCK YOU LITTERLLY WORKED ON IT.
Wait you run more than this channel I thought you had siblings that look and talk like you .
I think that Cupcake is possessed by Susie’s dog.
wait but were is the brother (garret)
That machine you're curious about is from a VHS tape, but I can't recall which one.
So . . . seeing as MatPat was in the movie, did he already KNOW everything that was going to happen and just ACTED as if he didn't for this theory video?
From the creators of "toy chica is willian afton"  arrives: 15:23
I can't believe how much he got right
me who watched the movie before watching this and knows what Nebraska means
FNAF is what got me in to MatPat and the Theorist channels, so seeing him show up in the movie was amazing.
there is no need for anyone to see the movie after this theory its literally spot on the plot
how did the Cupcake get possessed despite it not being big enough to fit a child inside?
“If you think this movie has a happy ending with everyone smiling and living happily ever after” it does 😂
Congrats on your role! 🎉🎉I loved seeing you in the movie! I look forward to watching you make a film theory on the whole movie. There’s so many Easter eggs I missed
This is omnilsisly pretty true I mean he was a part of it
im a new fan but i play the originals, still havent got to help wanted and security breach
That kid is golden Freddy it is confirmed in the movie
The Nebraska poster is to show where hid brother got taken
64 mat
It's scary how much if this is correct that I kept forgetting I wasn't watching a review of the movie (considering that this episode was written completely independent of MatPat).
Well uhm... they built a pillow fort at the end of the movie- Rlly checking off your predictions Ig
i held off on watching anything that could spoild the movie before i watched it with my friend. When the scene with the razor blade mask came on I was like "?!?! I guess that's ONE WAY of getting agony" and my friend was like haha wut
Okay, he did get this wrong (11:52)
nahh matt, that cupcake is just wildd
"Oh my sweet stars what have I done" - MatPat 2023
Little did we know he already new the whole story
Hearing “Matthew Lillard” come out of your mouth is a blessing. Thank you MatPat.    (I swear I love mat and mat the same please don’t theorize me)
Fried rice at denny's
I heard chikas eye twiched during production...          And  she was the first... We are not alone... :)
If it weren’t for your theories I wouldn’t have gone to enjoy this movie
Bro that halloween costume at the start was what i wore on halloween, no joke.
14:56 I don't think that the cupcake kid js well the cupcake you can see that the child that is wearing a hat has yellow close so it's kinda like golden Freddy as for the cupcake one well I think he's Freddy bcuz he's wearing brown outfit that js my theory
14:49 always satisfies me whenever I’m bored, having a bad day, or I’m in a bad mood 🙂🙂🙂
I love how he was in the movie and still got it wrong 😝😝😝
I'm here revisiting this theory after the movie...kinda wish it went this way
I have followed you and the FNAF series since DAY 1, and I LOVED it...but that's just it, I loved it. I saw the movie, and I loved it...but after trying so hard to piece all of the pieces together, I just can't. This universe started out as a fun, spoopy, heart attack wrenching series, but now....now it's just too much. Mike is William, but then there's Garrett, and Danny, and NO ONE knows each other...but they're all related, but they all died forever ago, but they didn't cause now they robots, but they don't know they are, and my brain is smoking in error just trying to make sense of it all. It doesn't. It MAKES NO SENSE WHAT SO EVER. It's like Afton is as powerful as Vorhees or Meyers, and I couldn't stand those asinine, pedantic, trivial movies either. I'm all down for creativity and imagination...but the laws of physics still gotta apply to that universe too, and it just doesn't seem to. Death is final. That's it. The End. Game Over. Making all these psychos be immortal in a way just doesn't work, and it's not gonna just cause you say it can. Once all these guys dead, they can't come back...yet they do...over and over and over. I can't. I'm done. I'm sorry Scott, I'm sorry MatPat, I'm sorry FNAF-heads. But I'm out. Peace!
Lucas garet will be gregorry
cupcake is possed by chicas dog
Knowing that this wasn’t made by matpat is insane. Really great job on the script .
I wonder if Vanessa is the one that drew the picture of the kids holding hands with Springbonnie when she was a kid
Susie’s dog soul is in the cupcake
Anyone wwtching this after we find out that hes in the movie. And knew the entire script 😅
1:51 I love that Matpat is saying this while already being in the movie lol and knowing EVERYTHING already
Bro matpat is in the movie
SPOILERS!!!!!        In the movie when their trying to put Abby into the inside of an animatronic (that I would say kinda resembles baby) I think that was definitely where it would have went if she Didint escape she was def supposed  to be baby
MattPatt you must think you’re real slick 🤣🤣🤣
Watched this after watching the movie and wow he's mostly accurate! 😮
ngl kinda mad he didn't talk about the come find me message in the end of the credits but ehh whatever
Yo but I think mike's dad is meant to be Henry but he's made the family a new identity, I mean unless Afton is remembering every name of his victims which can be likely but also notz buuut what if it's because he found the Emily) Schmidt family and wanted to get him back?  instead of him having the only daughter Afton does (I'm possibly assuming) in this world. I haven't got the best evidence but I'm thinking why would Afton take garret? Is it random? Was he in Nebraska too on a trip ? I doubt it as we know from the games this is where alot of things take place. What if Afton and Emily were here in bussines and the camping trip could have been an after for his family, something went down (iykyk) and they called if off, Afton in his rage after finding out about soul merging and whatnot, was looking for experiments but then also wanted to harm his old partner. Therefore garret gone....  Linking to the books, we have the Charlie having a twin, as we know Abby/baby isn't any accident but why, is this linking to the fourth closet and how Henry wants his daughter back, was she created to fill a void?   I know this is so out there and I still need alot of evidence but what if?
I love this video. The theory makes a lot of sense for a move format of FNAF. I especially am interested in the extra child  I think having the cupcake as the child could explain Chica's change. The fanpages and books often refer to Chica as friendly or lonely. She maybe started the idea of getting another child. It also explains Springtrap because Afton is still making the other versions of the animatronics. I believe that Abby would be caught before the end. That would explain why Golden Freddy is so close, he's the trickster, and explain why it more Mike stays a security guard.
I honestly kinda really like the twist that garrett turns out to be golden freddy. Wouldve been a much better twist i think but whatever
IF YOU GUYS WATCHED THE MOVIE, YOU KNOW THAT CHICA WAS TRYING TO PUT ABBY IN BABYS ANIMATRONIC SUIT
i am so happy that i didnt watched this before watching the movie
Very close, they got a lot of the main story beats, but definitely missed a few things.
Nah golden Freddy could be mike afton in that part
The fact that this movie was able to be pieced together just from trailers shows just why I hate movie trailers and watch movies going in blind if I can help it.
Mikes father was William affon partner
Bro how was he so right?
Not so impressive now considering you’re in the movie🤣
Don't get me wrong I love style theory but I'm still kinda sad he didn't do book theory 😭
After watching the movie, your theory’s so much  better than what actually happens lol
So how does William shove a body into the cupcake? I guess by completely mangling the body, which could explain why cupcake is so gosh darn violent
Why is Bonnie Blue...?
Its about 90% right. Good work. We never know who goldenfreddy is so.. 2nd movie ere we come
bro i personaly like this more than the real movie 😭😭😭
glad i watched this after the movie because you spoiled some stuff from it XD
I just watched it 10/10
Seriously, Garrett *should’ve* been Golden Freddy. Such a missed opportunity
In the movie when the animatronics try to put her into the springlock suit, the suit has what looks like a baby doll head on it 🤔
You should probably have made some more wrong predictions so it doesn’t seem like you really were in the movie
Why do I feel abby is already a robot
whos watching this after having seen the movie?
Now that we know that in fact Golden Freddy isn't Garret that leave us with the question, is Cupcake Garret, or is he the iconic FNAF character Sparky?
Theory: garret is the kid who was killed in the fnaf 2 mini game where he is standing outside and a car drives by and he turns into a crying child
This aged like radiator fluid(very well)
Great work fazgang
What if Chica is still Susie and cupcake is her dog that died?
8:00 Isn't that kid actor too young to be on social media? 🤨 He's clearly younger than 13
Bro got it die to the last detail
Cupcake needs the spotlight cupcake is love cupcake is live
this theory is better then the film
This didn't age well... especially for being in the movie, lol
after watching the movie think i prefer the theory of Golden Freddy being Garret. I do like the message of the movie of having to move on from the past but it is also nice to entertain an alternate universe where Abby gets to bond with her missing older brother and have Mike basically have a second chance to be with him. Who knows, maybe Garret and he other kid's souls are both sharing Golden Freddy like Matpat's theory of Golden Freddy being shared by Cassidy and the Crying Child in the games.
How did I avoid it this long? Honestly? I was such a major anti-fan that anything that hinted at FNAF I wouldn't go near. And now I'm here, lost and frantically trying to piece together what this frachise is about
I watched the movie and my friend got mad that I called Afton a furry
This makes sense now since he was in the movie and had a script
THIS WAS 2 ON POINT FOR IT TO BE UNCANON I WANT AN RETRIAL
oh god its spreading
okay so spoiler alert kinda, as he continued on the video he got it all wrong.
bro acting like he WASNT in the movie
15:16 Matt… the kid’s wearing a striped shirt. Just like crying child… 😮
Bro put all it together 😂
I theorize that the cupcake represents Susie's "lost" dog from the fnaf 6 arcade game. I remember reading that the characteristics of the animatronics have to do with their deaths, chica's cupcake could be an aspect of her death because William used her dog to lure her away and now she can sick her new dog on him at the end.
Who is here after watching the FNAF movie?
I didnt think you would be working in a diner wanted you to be a detective😞
I came to see you after the movie.😅 i seen ur cameo.
i heard the cupcake is actually Susie’s, or Chica’s, pet dog who also got killed, shown in the maze video game you play seeing “how” she died, and i think that is actually very accurate
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I mean it’s just a theory.
Just watched the movie really enjoyed but i was disappointed at the lack if the puppet and found the jumpscares lack luster
Nah he lied this whole time…
google meat
the purple tie! i saw the purple tie and immediately knew
Nice one
Hi
The cupcake isn’t anyone because there’s no way for someone to stuff a body inside a cupcake, it could’ve been chica’s dog however again, too big to fit inside, it’s likely that she just controls the cupcake
So turns out there’s no explanation for why the cupcake is alive. I was kinda hoping they’d show the girl who’s Chica had a pet hamster or something with when she got murdered, and its soul possessed the cupcake 😂
Ok idk if this was intentional, but I swear a lot of MatPat’s conclusions in this video seem like a HUGE step on purpose and trying to point us in different directions just so he could through us off about his reveal of him being in the movie. 🤣🤣🤣 He got way into the detail of the Nebraska poster, and the idea of the mask being for extracting remnant lol
the boy that didnt have any characteristics liked the girl thats why theyre close? idk just something that came to mind
Súper proud of all that you achieved 🎉 thank you
SPOILER WARNING! (small) I just watched the movie and I absolutely loved it. One thing though that stood out to me. When Mike and Vanessa are on their walk and  talking, they sit next to a water cannal. As far as I'm aware Minnesota doesn't have these and they are specific to NOLA. As someone who lives in Louisiana this  looked way too familiar haha.  This movie was amazing and the ending was perfect! 😊
I just watched the movie and at the end of the credits some voice spells out “come find me” :D
15:27 I believe Susie dog is Carl the cupcake, because William also killed him and he acts as a dog
This is unfair, he already knew all the movies gonna be about because he was in it lol
not a remnant extractor but a freddy mask to hide him like all the other kids bodies were hidden in the animatronics got the ending right but not about abby
Okay but about the *who's the fifth kid" theory (haven't seen the movie yet) can't it be charlie ? We know afton killed him/her (the game says both apparently) before he killed the kids and charlie's spirit is the reason the kids were able to control the animatronics, plus he has stripes on his shirt like puppet's stripes (which will hold charlie's spirit)
Im happy that I watched the movie first before Matpat's fellow writer Spoiled me with their theory
I just watched it you got SO MANY things right its crazy
WE ALL KNOW YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE
ok i mean mat is not wrong about the boy is the cupcake but people say that chica before she died she had a dog so when the dog died he became cupcake.
i LOVED when you were a Waiter in the movie ❤️🧡💚💙
After he’s recent video and the movie this is more interesting.
SEE. SEE! HE DID THE THING I SAID HE WOULD DO!!! HE MADE A FT VIDEO ABOUT THE FNAF MOVIE
after watching the fnaf movie it’s kinda obvious that he was in the movie lol
It’s been a crazy 9 years!
I haven’t seen the Fnaf movie at the time I sent this but I will soon
I started watching the movie and I seen matpat also I watched the whole sponsor
Did anyone else notice the shirt the guy who was attacked by the cupcake was wearing? The design on the shirt was the racing mini game in Fnaf pizzeria simulator. The one where you go off the side on the last lap and you get a secret of Afton going home and seeing that his son has run away again.
I am a new fnaf fan. I joined in August to this amazing community. This is the first MatPat video I’ve ever seen, and I now feel officially part of the FNAF community. Thanks matpat for all your theories
I hope they make multiple movies
I saw the cookbook at my school book fair😝😝
What if Mikes Brother is Cupcake?
You’re right the guy that gave him the job is William Afton
mat this is the 93rd fnuf theoy  . btw i THINK that the blonde hair kid looks like cassidy and may be hinting theirs two souls in golden freddy somehow. or garret is cupcake or something.
Vannessa: william afton is my father Me: i know where this is going
Interesting thing is the cupcake is an extension of chicka. This is why when the chicka is still the cupcake is able to move. Chika is able to possess the cupcake.
Absolutely love that he didn't have anything to do with the writing of this script. He knew he could have just spoiled the movie, but he chose to have someone else actually theorize about it.
Matpat when i watche sthe movie and saw yiu i was which joy but youve lost it by saying that that boy is carl the cupcake😂
MatPat already spoiled the movie for us a month before it was released lol
People are saying the theater exploded with cheering when Matt Pat showed on the screen, but nobody reacted in mine. huh.
Who is balloon boy? Because he moves
It would be such a good twist Michael's brother was golden Freddy
Okay I think I have a good theory about the extra kid I think he's Vanessa's brother who died maybe and that's why Vanessa has trauma about what her dad can do too😅😅    It's just a movie theory 😂😂😂
YOU WHERE IN THE FNAF MOVIE
Susie's (chica's real name) Susie's dog posse's  cupcake
Funny how he got 99 percent of this correct
Keep in mind matpat saw the entire script when he got his role
Sup
Actually he uses the Nebraska poster in his house to fo to sleep. Also he grew up in Nebraska and that's where his brother was kidnapped.
how tf did this guy guess the whole movie hacks
So i assume since you were in the movie you won't be able to release an updated fnaf theory tying the movie into the over world, which is reasonable but there will be an update right?
the 5th child is definitely Cassidy, blonde hair, blue eyes. I watched the movie and it literally implies its Cassidy too. Crying child and Cassidy are both in golden freddy, dont we know this lol?
What if that 5th kid (cupcake kid) is young Mike. In the movie when Mike trips in his dream, so does the little boy
Jesus loves you
Do you think that William survives the first springlock and gets springlocked again in the next movie?
I would genuinely watch you food theory cook the recipes in the FNAF cookbook. Kinda excited for it
You have a great team behind you. I watched your video then the movie now this one. Very impressed. Kids were so excited to see you in the film and my friend and I couldn't hold back out laughter with your theory line. We loved it so much🖤💜 keep up the great work
Wait till he hears about the fort building
I thought the Chica thing was bc it's her dog or sum
1:20 I missed fnaf because it looked cheesy when I was growing up now I'm trying to learn everything about the franchise before watching the movie
Are you in the movie 🟣🟤🟡🔴🟠⚪️🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪😎🥸
Don’t get me wrong I loved the movie and I know it had to be PG-13 for the kids but I think it’s hilarious that Matpat theory was better than the movie
6:20 when your talking about the 5th kid possibly being cupcake I think your right if you look at the color of the cupcake liner and the 5th kids shirt it’s the same line pattern and color so I think it’s safe to say the 5th kid is cupcake and plus with how the kid acts passive aggressive about Abby and Cupcake being so unhinged yeah I think your right 😅
I had a theory that Mike and his siblings parents showed in the movie is not their real parents that Willam's wife knew what he has been doing and was sacred so their children went to her sister or brother. So Garrett being kidnap could have been Afton being angry and trying to get his kids back
Anyone else feel weird about this video after knowing Matt had the whole script? We love you Matt but this one was a little sus
I always thought Cupcake was tethered to miss Chica
So he got it right
Steve raglan William afton literally rhymes
After seeing the movie you were off by honestly a lot, Nebraska was for Mike using it to relive his dream, and that whole plot twist was not right, and Afton is definitely the antagonist
hello mat pat i have a weird theory but you know in fnaf 4 you said that theres a hospital thingy behing the bed and that someone was injured and seeing the nightmare versions of the animatronics , what if that person is actually vanessa . if you see in the movie of fanaf it looks like its the thing of the hospital that vannesa is on looks very similar to the one  in fnaf 4. also it makes sense that in security breach shes looking for the crying child because how did she know gregorys name in the fist place
I loved your scene in the movie
Five kids five robots even the cupcake
My theory: In the first night of being a security guard, he falls asleep, in his dream he saw five kids, the kid with blonde hair is Golden Freddy, the kid with a top hat is Freddy, The kid with bunny ears is Bonnie, and the kid with pigtails is Chica, also the kid with a hook is Foxy
“Some people say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day” “but that’s just a theory”
wow i’m glad i watched this after i watched the movie because i never realized how much of the plot the trailers actually give away
I think Matpat has gone insane 😭😭
i wish this was what the movie is
put the pic up is because his brother was kidnapped
This is so disgustingly close to be spot on to how the movie went 😭
This is the one time MatPat for sure has inside information on the movie. Glad he got to use his catchphrase in the film👍 Along with Cory’s classic scream it was fun to see these two creators in this movie.
kinda hard to put body in a cupcake
ANNOYING ORANGE DID A LETS PLAY OF FNAF?!?!?!?
I think in my opinion, as you said he intentionally put the nabraska poster. But I don't think he put there because it his goal or freedom. I think he intentionally put there so before he going to sleep he would look at that poster to remind him that place/park where his brother kindnap so he could have the same dream again. I noticed it when he was on his bedroom. I think I remember I read something like when you think about something before going to sleep you will going to have dreams about what were you thinking before sleeping.  Sorry for my very bad Grammer. :((
.
Is there another theory out there now that it's out LOL cuz yeah I'm curious I'm not the biggest fan but I watched it and saw the reviews, and I feel it was pretty mediocre
The cupcake carried
I have a theory, he figured out the movie before he was out, because HE was in it, just watched it and congratulations on making it to the big screen ❤🎉
Ok 6 min into this after seeing the film and I'm like dude you had a appearance in the diner don't act like you didn't get the scoop on what the story of the movie is
Garrett is adorable
Minor shame that parts of your theory were wrong, since it would have made the movie a bit more interesting... but oh well lol
Well it wasn't but this plot was waaaay better
Is there a new theory you made after watching the movie?
i just got home from the movie, ill be honest i hid my face for a lot of it cause i scare easy but spoiler altert: with vanessa being williams daughter in the movie, could we say the same about the games and if so, does he control her so she becomes vanny during the time hes locked away? like while shes in a coma after being attacked by her father, does he take partial control of her and cause her to become vanny and therefore make her his successor in the part of the timeline between him being springlocked and being discovered for fazbear frights? just something to think on that my friends and i wondered
cmon man we all saw the movie no reason to make a vid on the easter eggs on the movie that most of saw hopefully
I’m from the future guys Matpat is IN THE MOVIE
Wow Matt Patt is always wrong, who saw that coming!!!!
Well this video aged like milk, huh Ness?
15:48 I remember hearing, or one of my friends assuming or telling me, that the original girl (in the lore) who was killed by Afton, I believe was Susie, she had a dog. And just from watching the movie and knowing that information, I think it’d make sense that the dogs spirit is the cupcake. Plus it was killed, and it would make sense due to the way the cupcake aggressive attacks and acts similarly to a dog.
I think……… his theory….. was a little bit off, but not by much. Pat on the back mattpatt
😃😃😃😄😁
it crazy how right yet how wrong he was
Just watched the movie I yelled MATPAT in the theater when I saw your cameo and when you said “well that’s just a theory” wow chills up my spine
SOLVED!
here after the movie…. y’all weren’t ready for the inaccuracy. VANESSA US WILLIAMS DAUGHTER IN THE MOVIE. WHAT THE FRICK
You know what, mat actually did pretty good at solving this one. I came back after I watched the movie and saw this
just watched the movie, have fun with that HUGE plot twist. need to re-do that timeline !
WAS WENN CUPCAKE VON CHICA KONTROLLIERT WIRD !!!!!!!!😮😮😮😮😮
How can you make a theory when you had the script?
2:38 Its from fnaf ar its called tourture freddy
After hearing how confident Matt is on this... I'm curious to see his reaction to the actual movie events 😭
bro he's in the movie!!! smh!!!
Jeeze - I saw this movie only based upon GameTheory’s coverage over the years. I was shocked at the villain reveal, but there was a tell, so i never thought he was innocent. The cop reveal was good too, explains her dialogue. I went in blind, ignored all trailers and this theory, coming back to it after I saw the movie last night. They give so friggin much away these days esp on a shorter film. Trailer studios need to do better.
Now I really wonder, how that cupcake is alive?
So glad im watching this after the movie
Bro fooled us into thinking he didn't have the script
are you casting in the movie
Just letting everyone know when the lights where flickering on the mirror it said it’s me=golden Freddy 🫢
my theory: It says noone wanted her and the higher ups got vanessa into SB. Maybe police fired her because of corruption.
another fnaf theory  you can't escape
this opening is awesome because he is in the movie
Be honest you used the info from the set didnt you
It is insane how close to being 100% correct MatPat was.
There should be a music theory.
Since in the games it say “it’s me” and “the one I shouldn’t have killed” and in the movie “come and find me” but if u put it all together it says “come find me,it’s me,the one u shouldn’t have killed
I loved how the movie debunks matpat's theory lol
I think the movie come of the book
In the actual film in a camera frame it’s stated as being the year 2000
Why would the Easter egg at the end be balloon boy in a taxi and what if balloon boy is garrot and balloon boy "is returning home"
"really only 60?" feels a lot different knowing now matt didn't write this script
I just watched fnaf with at a halloween party it was so fun to watch
Am I the only one that thought that 'remnant extractor' was the scooper?
Bro talking like he’s not in the film 😂😂
tbh this would be a better story line
It’s weird that this is one of the only theories that mat didn’t wright
Another 2 will be REALLY GOOD LIKE THE FIRST
Matpat sure got a lot right.
(SPOILER WARNING)      I after watching the movie, I do think he's golden Freddie due to his ghost appearing with golden Freddie.
After watching the FNAF movie and coming back to this theory, I wonder if he was in those writers calls to craft this episode?
Sadly the movie does end on a pretty happy note I wish it was just a scary movie
My friend and I just watched the movie and when you came on the screen we were SO excited!!!!!!!
I thought that in the games/novels there was 2 spirits in golden freddy (cassidy and cc) unless cupcake has suddenly turned into the main character for fnaf and that kid is actually the cupcakes spirit
Who came here after watching the movie and seeing that one restaurant scene that features a certain individual?
Ham
im watching this right after the movie btw
Just saw the movie, it was pretty good
You know if the movie was more like matpats theory it could’ve been better
You know if the movie was more like matpats theory it could’ve been better
Halo?
I'm very excited for Matthew Lillard's 3 movie contract! Exciting! Well done, Matpat! You deserve it, you're amazing!
The kid must be golden freddy because when they entered the house golden fredbear was in and when he was talking to abby the kid was talking instead of the animatronic
I saw people on YouTube, make it a videos first So I am making series in my head, all alone, no YouTube       You guys can quote it
So when we’re you gonna let us know you’re in the movie? Congratulations btw, this series has come a longggg way 🎉
I predict a really dorky cameo from a YouTuber that talks waaay too much about this franchise...
Did we just forget about the puppet?? I think that one blonde kid is the puppet I mean look at his shirt??
Usually I go back to theories after I’ve seen to movie to see how it compares, but now I get to do a double analysis on this one.
Uroyl wowe out off
Ufoyl wowe out off
I thought the crying child becomes the puppet?
Man it’s almost like matpat knew the plot in the movie
MatPat: Why does she befriend THEM? Non FNAF fans: GOLDEN FREDDY IS NON BINARY!?! Fnaf fans: Oh you dont know anything mate-
FNAF Cook Book = "How to serve Man" ?😅
Bro after years and years I’m finally watching game theory. Just because seeing his cameo in the Fnaf movie took me back years
This script seems slightly better than the one we got.
bro had the whole script and we didn't know
You can see only a little in the mirror in the car but it doesn’t show it’s face
Isn’t this the guy who played the waiter in the fnaf movie, I didn’t know he had a youtube channel.
The way that this was SPOT ON. Crazy
POV Mike takes 1 step Matpat: THE LOREEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
I will actually think that the 5th child is Golden Freddy, I mean the Freddy Abby was hanging out is withered and when Abby entered the restaurant, the Freddy she was with mysteriously disappeared and when she went into the stage, we saw a Not Withered Normal Freddy
You did an incredible job hiding the fact u were in the movie and i realise now that u were talking about this i realise that ur not letting anything on like ur hidibg something
you were in the FNAF movie
The mysterious blond child in the group of five is Cassedy. Not only are the first five children put into the core found and golden freddy, but cassedy was part of them. And both the kid and cassedy have blond, short hair. Pretty hard evidence to deny. BUT HEY! That's just a theory. A GAME THEORY!! thanks for reading my comment. :) -SolarrStars263
But hey that’s just a thoery a #@£& thoery
"People say that but it's just a theory"
Very interesting
Bro how did You basically guess the movie
I edged to your scene
The fact he knew the entire time what the movie was about. He gave us subtle lies to keep convincing us he wasn’t even in the movie.
Yo when I seen you in the movie I screamed 😂😂
Everyone in the movie theater seen your face and screamed matpat I was shaking my dads arm and pointing at the screen. Also in the movie I could tell you wanted to explode with happiness
i didnt expect for mat to be in fnaf movie
You and Cory were the true jump scares in the FNaF movie.
Just watch the movie. 😂
Who else is watching this after watching the movie?
living in Nebraska I'm so happy
6:48  turns out, the drawings ARE the lore ( kind of 💀)
garrot plays balloon boy in the movie
Well then
Venassa said the William Antonio was her dad is this something new? BTW I watched the full movie
This is terrifyingly accurate
Bad cupcake...
This is basically how the movie went
Hellooo I accidentally watched the video of you revealing that you got a scene in the FNAF movie I was so happy that you finally got the part!! Watched you for 8 years and I’m so happy you got to meet Scott :) I LOVE YOUU❤️❤️
Matpat. The God of Fnaf. Has more to feed on.
I’m glad I didn’t watch this untill I watched the movie
FNAF is spreading XD
I like how you acted like u didn’t know the whole plot lol.
The kid with no appearance applications like a hook he has a striped shirt like the crying child with I believe became golden Freddy
Pls explain to me why that if Williams suit is fail safe why did it go off from the cupcake bite. But In the game it was because of himself. Yes i understand the movie is it’s own thing but I feel if they said of yeah he jammed the gears in the fur to not move and the bite pushed it forward would make lil more sense on he felt safe in there .
bro read the script 💀
It takes place in 2000 it says it in the office when he fights the guy in the water fountain
So happy I didn't watch this before I seen the movie
!spoilers ahead!     So I have a theory that Garrett, Mikes younger brother whom got taken is the puppet. He was the first child who got taken/killed, and when Venessa showed Mike the picture of her, the pizzeria looks brand new, like she was at the Grand Opening.   I could be wrong, but in my mind it seems like it could happen in Fnaf 2.
THIS MF DID NOT SPIT THIS TIME
How does it feel to be in a movie
4:52 I knew the Mormons were up to something
YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE
I want an r rated version of the fnaf movie but too many kids like it so i know it ain't happening 😢
THIS IS WAY BETTER THEN WHAT WE GOT.
I watch it and it was SO AMAZING I love it this is my new favorite one ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What about Balloon boy couldn’t he also be Garret. I mean most of the time we see Balloon boy he is where Mike Finds him like the locker and other places.
the movie and recent games are trash sadly
Proud to see how far you've come, seeing you in the cinema was such a shocker, it made me smile so much :)
I hope they make a directors cut where mark is the gaurd in the beginning
0:47 Eh? Whats that? Did I hear "history of mascot costumes" or "logistics/real science of springlock suits" right there? I better have!
Watching this knowing your role is *chefs kiss*
Happy I watched the video of you explaining how you had someone else write this episode so it didn’t feel like you where cheating. It definitely would have rubbed me wrong if I saw this first after the movie.
Bro for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, You are in for one awesome, amazing, spectacular movie and surprise.
I thought that that child being the cupcake is a pretty cool twist
Just came here to say I saw you in the movie my dude!
YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE... oh you sly fox
I think that the blond gohst kid and Garret are in golden freddy
The fifth child must be golden freddy as his T-shirt is the same as the crying child who haunts him. Although the cupcake is an idea
if steve raglin is the phone guy, and also william afton does that mean phone guy = william afton??????????
you didn't solve anything, more videos to make.
I live in Nebraska lol
How did bro know🫣
Film theories or spoilers from behind the scenes?!?😂
The cupcake is the dog promised to Susie the child who is chica
He got us
He got everything right except the fact that there would be a twist. Nope. No twist. 1/10 movie lol even the general public wouldn’t like it.
This aged well
You know it's funny because what Matt Pat things what happened in the actual movie sounds way more interesting than the actual movie was
The fact he made a theory of a movie he was in-
Can I just say I'm so glad I opted to watch this on Peacock instead of in theaters, simply so I was able to rewatch MattPat's scene after screaming through all his lines the first time 😂
i haven’t watched this video yet so idk what he says but here’s my theory   fnaf theory  remember how the creator of the fnaf movie said they were gonna keep it as close as the lore as possible? what if we were all wrong about the lore? what if the stuff in the fnaf movie is the real lore, ofc it’s missing some stuff but that’s because it’s only the first movie. it’s about the first game, we know mattpat knows (sorta) what he is doing but his theory’s are getting even more crazier. i’m not saying he’s wrong, but what if we are looking at it in the wrong perspective? what if it’s all a dream of mike wanting to be a child of a man who is famous in their small town for his diner? so he dreams about it, but like all dreams they turn into nightmares. but he eventually grows up. so that might relate to why mike doesn’t want to work there, because of his “dreams” he thinks of the pizzera in a bad way. so maybe when he was mad at his brother (before his death) he dreamed of the bite of 83, the one thing that doesn’t really make sense is Abby. Mike is 30, Abby is 10, so Abby was brown when mike was 30, in suspecting their mother died around when abby was 2 or so, so he would’ve been dreaming about Abby (or elizabeth in his dreams) when he was 20. He still could’ve, maybe it was a way to cope with their father leaving and his mother dying?
Its funny how it ties into the vr game
No charm. Willy’s Wonderland rip off. If you were entertained by this you have maybe the worst taste in film.
I saw you in the movie and you where awesome in it as the server in that little restaurant to the woman who wanted to have her brother killed or lose his job but you did good in it.
It's possible that Garrett was snatched for remnant experiments and became Golden Freddy and Cassidy could be Mr Cupcake
I never had a fnaf phase lol I’m 22
I’ve been deceived, dare I say, maybe even bamboozled!
I didn't watch this till after the fnaf movie. Didn't want any spoilers.
The way he just found out the whole plot twist with just a trailer, an instagram post, and a cast list
Kinda a W that Matt’s in the movie
Theory: He lied so he can’t ruin the movie
He lied to us. He was always lying. He WAS in the FNaF movie. CONGRATS TO U MAT! (oh and btw i just finished watching it 35 minutes ago)
game theory or film theory
No he had a babysitter but Freddy ate her🤖
or u just read the script of the movie
Dude you work at the cafe in the movie
Did I just see Emmymade in this video??? I'm not sure if the other guy is Markiplier but I'm certain the other person is Emmymade.
Team saw matpat in the fnaf moviv  👇
What are those noises at the end? Morse code?
That is not just an average car it's a 1998 Honda Accord lx 5:34
Bro spoiled the movie before it came out💀
Gonna be honest here. I think that Mike's brother is gonna be the Marionette animtronic for the 2nd movie.
Now that the movie is out I feel like there should be another theory video now that we know what these things we saw in trailer actually mean
You are in the movie
Bro nailed the solving the movie. Congrats on the role as well. I didnt immediately recognize you. I was like where do i know him from but before i could even finish the thought i blurted out yo its game theory guy and i said theory when you did and my roommate was like i thought you said you hadn't see this. She didnt realize what i was saying just that i said theory exactly when you did.
after watching your yeah I was in the movie i rewatched this and found that you gave some hints in the video and I just wanted to say that is amazing and how naturally they were so good job for everything you have done for fnaf
Wait until Matpat see the pillow fort scene.
DUDE THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE WAS SEEING YOU!!
I am so confused because Vanessa ends up being aftons daughter help?
Of course you solve this movie because you were in it!
I think that the movie would have been better if MatPat wrote the story
when i watched the movie and mat says its just a theory physically i got a serotonin boost
Bro it’s kinda crazy how close this is to the movie
Just wanted to put this theory here since the movie has come out and me and my girlfriend have been theorizing over it like hawks  (Spoilers if you havent watched the movie!!)       A detail that was brought by my girlfriend while we watched the movie was the balloon boy that appeared around the movie. The doll is obviously super natural, as we see it move around the establishment, in the office, the closet, and the taxi at the ending credits scene. We made a few connections and timeline jumps based on the games (even tho the movie universe and the games are different, we just thought we'd piece things together.) and we figured that the reason it moved around was because it was possessed but not by any of the kids, since they're obviously possessing the animatronics. And since there's only one person that's assumed dead during the movie, which is Garret, Mike's brother. Since FNAF 2 is a prequel, we figured that the time he dissapeared is around the time the old establishment before the opening of the new establishment in FNAF 1. That would explain why Balloon Boy moves around, and what happened to Garret in the first place.   Just a thought.
People who have watched the FNAF movie and are watching this a day after watching it
Bro managed to spoil the movie, without spoiling the movie.   And he played in it, so he already knew everything😂.
Seems a little weird to be making incorrect theory videos when you've had access to the whole script for more than a year.
"And then there's Abby who is a literal anagram of Baby"  Me: "......................................... *Ouch*"
Loved seeing u in the fnaf movie MatPat you’ve been Working so hard nd I’m glad to finally see u on the big screen instead of my tiny phone screen
Bro you lied!
im happy that matpat is the one that finally mentions that not everything in the movie is from the games which is something a lot of negative reviews people have left dont realize
Watched the movie, it was legit fun. Enjoyed it… the Camino was good
Bro was in the movie this isn’t fair. He knew
Bro.
Shockingly accurate
Maybe we were wrong about puppet Maybe the 5 kid is puppet the striped shirt and the puppet jump scare mini game
God sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to DIE for us. That’s how much God loves us. Jesus Christ was crucified and rose from the dead three days later. Jesus died for our sins and mistakes so that all of us could be saved. None of us deserve to go to Heaven but because of Jesus’s sacrifice, we can as long as we believe in Jesus and His sacrifice for us. Jesus saved you. He saved all of us. Repent and turn to the Lord before it’s too late. God bless you all!🙏❤✝
Withered SpringBonnie...
Wouldn’t make sense that the kids were killed in the kitchen since the camera is disabled???!!!
Mike schmit is in the first game he’s who we play as
NAHHH MATPAT IN THE MOVIE🤩🤩🤩
I always come back
William also uses the signal from the twisted closet in the movie
I just wanna take a sealer for  Fanf movie just now
if only
hur hur hur hur hur hur hur hur hur hur hur      I just had to
bud is in the movie
I swear the dog from the duck hunt game is a broken animatronic too😂
I know why Mat knows so much he was in the movie so he obviously knowed what was going to happen
Crazy seeing how he new how this ended
Unfortunately it was a happy ending
The movie is out, and the jig is up.
I just seen this movie last night and you know what?  You nailed it. Not sure how you knew so much but that was cool.
Heres a theory Its a spoiler         Did you know you were in the movie and you were in the diner🤯🤯🤯       This is a joke... Please no hate... But for real.. He was in the movie...
Technically if he made the cameo in the movie wouldn’t he kinda know what the movie is already about? I just watched it and he’s spot on with everything
You are in the movie 😮
Funny thing about you being in the film was my friend legit said to me "i wonder if any YouTubers are gonna be in this film." And legit next scene you came into the diner. I had a similar moment when i was like "gee i guess they forgot about that crazy aunt lady." And then next scene she comes back into the film. Crazy coincidence
14:57
OMG when you appeared in the movie me and my bestie freaked out !!! It made the movie immediately more awesome than it already was haha
whos here after finding out matpat was in the fnaf movie
I was watching the movie in Nebraska and when we saw garret got kidnapped in Nebraska we cheered!
Spoiler  alert‼️                        I am so glad may pay is at least in a little bit of the deaf movie lol
The cupcake is the spirit of the girls dog
It was good but I’m mad at the ending
Skip ad 11:12
You knew the lore and you spoiled the movie but I am so happy that you made it in the movie 😂😂😂 so Is it really a theory when it’s true
Not far off
i gasped so loud when i heard your voice i instantly knew it was you!!
"I thought that it was breakfast yeah but that's just a theory"
Boy were you wrong
Matpat is the type of guy to get sponsored by google meet
I wasn’t expecting you to be in the movie
So
After watching the movie, you did pretty good on the theory!
If anyone need the fnaf movie for free tell me ill giv u on discord
HE’S IN THE MOVIE!
Just got out of the movie. It’s insane how much he got right.
The only thing that messes with my head the most is what year the movie takes place, you have early 90s to late 90s tech but then you have a 98 to 02 honda accord that is in very rough condition. That car screws with the year placement quite a bit when you remember the 90s tech would make sense as someone with very little wealth but then a car that is either newish (within 5 years) or somehow damaged with lots of rust everywhere within a year of the car being new. Give Mike a 91 accord and bam! No problem, but that accord really screws the timeline
The fact that this wasn't written by mat really goes to show the talent of the theorist team!
YOUR IN THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!
Gotta rewatch this knowing he didn’t write this
Next is minecraft movie
Matpat, The boy you think is the cupcake should be the crying child right? I mean he has the exact shirt. I haven't seen the movie yet but hopefully they will reveal it.
I came back to watch this after the movie came out. And most things were correct but some things weren't.
He spoiled the whole villain in the movie💀
BRUH, ur litteraly IN the movie!!
You. . .you were in the FREAKING MOVIE
As a Nebraskan I’m so happy that our very unknown and forgotten state is becoming part of the FNAF LOOOOOOORE it’s nice that we are getting more recognition
Ok I just watched the movie and CONGRATULATIONS! I was so excited when I saw you on screen!! But it definitely makes sense that they put the one guy solved the whole F NAF lore on screen!
Pretty acurate
In the Fnaf movie I loved the fact that you were in it.
The son of a gun made it into the movie. Well done.
dang u were kinda wrong
Matpat, you’re predictions are like 95 percent correct! Good job!
Sorry if i'm spoiling the movie, but mattpat is in the movie
Well I gotta say, after watching the movie you were right about some things and you were wrong about some things. All in all, it was so amazing seeing you in the movie! And when you said, "But that's just a theory", myself and everyone in the theatre said it with you with joyful laughs. It was amazing man ❤❤❤
Bro i jumped out of the chair when i saw you
wow. just. wow. now this is what I consider a cheat. You had the script, Matt- way long ago, yet you still made theories about the movie. this is why I watch you <3
🔉🔉🔉🔉🔉🔉🔉🔉
Post movie watch, it's so funny how close Mat is in some parts and how fast in others lol
After seeing the movie and then this theory it's fascinating how accurate he is
I’m surprised about how right he was
To je moj rodjendan
It's great that he was in the movie
I just finished watching the movie and I went crazy when I saw you in this along with Cory this is so I am so darn happy for you and Cory and man I don't know what to say it's just amazing
That would be so cool if he got his own part in the fnaf movie in a cafe like that would funny and if his name was ness like sans ness like that would be so crazy
He got most of right
He was the guy it’s him
I saw u in the movie and everyone in the there’re gasped when u said it’s just a theory! I’ve been watching u since I was 11 thank u for keeping me sane during quarentine! 😭
I got an ad for the movie in the middle of the video 😂 Excited to see you on the big screen!
Its funny when you watch the video after the movie😂
Mike shmidt is on the name of the first check in fnaf one
While I was watching it I thought golden Freddy ghost kid was normal Freddy ghost kid and Freddy ghost kidwas cupcake ghost kid
I WATCHED THE MOVIE CIRCUS BABYS SUIT IS SHOWN IN A STORAGE ROOM
And you're in the movie, I saw it. Love the shameless promotion
Isint Nebraska the place he keeps getting the nightmares of his family camping
Isint Nebraska the place he keeps getting the nightmares of his family camping
Isint Nebraska the place he keeps getting the nightmares of his family camping
E
Some of it, you hit the nail on the head but you were wrong about the intruders and the clown
Just watched you latest video so it doesn’t smoke me how much you got correct lol but still cool
Hey waiter
I was so happy to see you and cory in the movie Good job Mat!
me: knowing more lore in FNAF except of knowing more school topics...
how tf do you get sponsored by google meet
SPOLIER ALERT! (I Watched the movie) Theres 2 version's of spring trap (spring bonnie) and the spring trap  Dont see if you didnt watch it</3
Nabraska is remining mike of his lost brother
Kinda easy when you see First hand it
You where in it
Dude, I just saw the movie yesterday! I was stunned and shocked at the entrance so much. I was at the edge of my seat when you were preforming. And the catchphrase always makes me smile: "Just a Theory"
“He couldn’t afford a babysitter” Well……….
If you want an idea for a fnaf style theory video then maybe base it on the spring lock suits and if they would be even legal
i got an ad for the fnaf movie on this vid, so thats kinda ironic
wrong its a happy ending
I'm SO happy I watched this after the actual movie lol
Your in the movie
Lol last night aka October 27th me,my younger sister, and my dad watched the fnaf movie and me, and my sister both freaked out when we saw you in it and because I've already watched it I would know if the theories you are saying are true or not.
Bro is in the movie 🤯
Interesting to watch this after knowing this is the editor's theory and not yours because you already knew all the script 😂
And you where wrong there where kids soles in the animation and also they where after his sister
I already watched the movie
I love the fact in the blender everybody is blended but william just comes out. Proves he always comes back
I'm guessing this is Matpat just acting, considering he had a role in the FNAF moive he was able to watch it before the release date meaning he was able to get a almost spot on theory on what was going to happen in the moive, also he probably knew that the blonde boy was Golden Freddy because he looks identical to the child after you die in Ultimate Custon Night so he had to make it seem like he thought it was the cupcake so it doesn't raise suspicion that he already knew what happened
thank GOD i didn't watch this before watching the movie cause this is basically spot on
My theory is that the old looking baby Anamtronic that chica was trying to put Abby in is baby before she was completely finished and what I find confusing is that Vanessas dad is william Afton so would that mak her like elizabeth just older? Like she changed her identity after everything
My theory is William afton is the person who recommended the job to mike. They look similar.
Yknow abby had a babysitter but she got jumped by the animatronics
you were very good at faking the fact that you read the script and were in the movie. the script was written by a team member
It’s wild how you kept this a secret
what if the animatronic actually made abby like them?
Exotic butters
I didn’t realize you were in the movie since there wasn’t any fnaf lore being explained
i cant believe how accurate matpat was about the remnant extractor.
Matpat i screamed as loud as I can  when I saw you in the movie when you said "it's just a theory" I loved it (I wasn't in the theater don't worry) well done!
I saw a fnaf movie ad rn here lol
Honestly this was super close to the original and the theories were spot on
bro just spoiled the movie before it release, and it's accurate!
After watching the most recent video, this one hits different now
I need him to sit down and film a stop and start of the movie 😂
I’m watching this when the Fnaf movie did come out and he got two things right
local internet stalker solves trailer
I saw the film, spoilers: Vanessa said to mike schmidt about william afton: "He is my father. " I think in the movie mike schmidt isnt michael afton, because then he would know, what happend, but he does not. Correct me if im wrong.
He’s in the movie omg
Imagine how much he knew , he knew it all.
The move was absolutely dogshit and you were completely wrong
this was one of the best movies ever and when mattpat came on the big screen it was so hype
oh dear god no, it's invaded film theory.
Are breakfast is good but that's just a theory
Is that FREDDY FAZBEAR???? HARR HARR HARR HARR HARR, HARR HARR HARR HARR HARR 🐻🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Watching this and knowing that you had the *entire script* for the movie makes it extremely interesting.
I am confused. Is the movie cannon to the game? I’ve been asking myself this the whole time 😭
Mat nice try you almost spoil half the movie but impressive im proud abt it that you were fooling everyone that u weren't in it but at the same time the Theory in the vid were correct half of it
Corykenshin and mat in this movie is crazy
BRO WHEN EVERYONE HEARD YOU SAY  "its just a theory" EVERYONE WAS SCREAMING IN JOY
The movie is completely removed from the games.  Vanessa is completely different from Vanny from the game because William Afton only had 3 kids and his only daughter was killed by Baby. Mike Schmitt is completely different too because the one in the game is from when the pizzeria was still active. The movie is absolutely an independent plot separate from the games. William Afton is generally the same minus the part where he has Vanessa as a daughter and the exact method how he was killed.
It's funny non of these were right
But where is Michael afton
Anyone else watching after seeing him in the movie
It‘s crazy how you more or less solved the Movie. Only we still don‘t know who golden freddy is
Funny u threw right and wrong in and u knew it all. Well done
He gets springlocked
I know the end
It’s been so long since I’ve watched any of the theory videos on any channel, I missed this so much❤
A little spoiler matpat is in the movie
bro just predicted the entire fnaf movie in an entire video
I spent this whole video going ‘that would’ve been so much better than what they decided to do’ 😖
Bro didn’t tell us HIS surprise
If u really think about it, bro spoiled the movie like a month in advance 😂 8:10
I can’t believe I missed matpat’s cameo skmehow.
I saw the movie and was really disappointed
This aged well
⚠️SPOILERS⚠️ What is Nebraska was where mikes brother got kidnapped because it shows the forest and his brother got kidnapped in the forest as they were camping. Also like you said Abby can spell Baby. So what if Abby=circus Baby?
1:26 Actual genius, he put coryxkenshin and TLT together in this scene, since cory was an actor and TLT was doing the credits music for the movie.
everyone in the theater  (myself included) started screaming when they heard ur voice. and then we all screamed again when u said ur little “just a theory” line!!! seriously so awesome mat, we loved ya!
If you look at william aftons id it says his full name is william schmid afton which is like the maincharacters name Mike schmid even though he isnt his son in the movie
Oh Mat you got so much wrong
WHOS BRAd MILLER ??????????? . Is he related? To Dave miller ?
*Spoiler:* The pictures actually influence them, they think that he is their friend, changing the picture, which they did, will change the way they think about him
YOURE IN THE MOVIE😂😂😂😂😂
has anyone ever considered there might be multiple different timelines within the franchise? or, they are the different dreams of individual characters, all sharing a similar nightmare
My guy.... A theory? You were in the movie
I was edging when I saw you in the movie Mat Pat, great acting 💯💯💯
I alr watched the movie let me see your prediction
You never fail to impress us MatPat, this theory was ON POINT! After seeing the FNaF movie I'm glad to say you were literally correct about almost everything. On top of you lying to us about your non-existent role in the movie. Great job!
Matt pat stalking a kids instagram in his theories ?????
abby didnt get stuffed,she got saved by mike
⚠️SPOLIER WARNING THE FNAF MOVIE⚠️ I just got back from seeing the movie and i had a thought, The blond kid, golden freddy. I originally thought he could be the crying child but he's kinda mean and manipulative. I think instead he could be a stand in for Cassidy, the one william shouldn't have killed. That's why he's the one shutting the door on william.
Soon fnaf will make merchandise and a real life location and take over all theory channelsa
I watched this after I watched the movie😂
Plot twist: he was in the movie
I rly thought mikes brother was golden Freddy  *T H E O N E Y O U S H O U L D N T H A V E K I L K E D*
Isnt mike shmit micheal afton
YOU… YOU, YOU LIIIEED TO US!!! …….!!!!!! IM GOING TO congratulate you!!! 🎉🎉🎉
WHY ARE HIS INTROS GETTING BETTER!!!!!! :0
No wonder he was able to solve the film before it came out 🤔
Waiter scean
I have a theory maybe the career councilor gave Mike the job to finish off the job since he killed his younger brother
Honestly dude the fact that you know everything already proves that this was just a cash grab. Yeah yeah you kept everyone fooled but really all you did was line your pocket. Kinda sad.
1:12 I never look at horror so I didn’t know it existed until I saw my friend playing fnaf and ever since I knew about fnaf
At the end of the FNAF movie, they played the song “My Grandfather’s Clock”. Which is the puppet music box song from FNAF two.
The animatronics wanted more members to be dead just like how the Titanic did💀
how is this so accurate??
Ellie plushie 😍
Very close theory! But alas, I guess the kidnapping of Mike's younger brother is a setup for a sequel if that ever gets made
How did you find it? (Mine question.)
so i *JUST* watched the FNAF movie like literally, less than half an hour ago i walked out of the theater and it is so cool to see what he got right and what he got wrong now no spoilers for those who haven't watched it yet, but go watch the movie PLEASE! it's SOO GOOD!
You cheated you  were in the movie so you knew what would happen explain this
Now knowing that Mat knew the entire script and this video was made by another scipt writer in the team, shows you that Mat was really playing the long game with his cameo because this convinced me that he didnt have a cameo😂
Yo I just watched the movie with my gf like an hours ago this is spot on bro whatttttty how does he do it
I thought it was based off of 2003 because one the phones are hinting abt it 2 your scene is at a classic fast food diner and 3 Vanessa says this place could change in 20 years hinting ether this movie or fnaf security breach(birth of the pizza Plex) and Vanessa is the owner
Being here after seeing the movie is crazy
Mike’s brother is golden Freddy that explains why golden Freddy is being nice to Abby because golden Freddy is Abby‘s uncle Dun dun dun
You pranked us and I completely fell for it
Good thing i saw the movie before this video, so many things are true and spoilers xD
Matpat your whole video is wrong
8:24 he was wrong
Clever. Very clever-
8:56  start of sponsor 11:03  end of sponsor
Coming back today just to say we up Matpat we up
Cupcake can fly  Edit:yes I liked my own comment
8:56 it’s.. it’s the scene oh noo
No William Afton took gerrit
kinda awkward watching this after watching the movie…
i j watched this movie and he might be right abt abby turning into baby, just not this movie. Considering the foreshadowing of her touch the baby suit
Hm this didn’t age well
You sure theres nothing about the pictures cause as someone who watched the movie, there is a big part of the pictures in the movie
I'm a Huge fan of the FNAF franchise and have been watching it from the days MatPat and Markiplier first got involved. Well... I went into the movie completely blind! No trailers! No theories! No info on actors or anything! Mostly by staying off of YouTube and other media completely. I knew about this video and waited to watch it until after I saw the movie yesterday! I'll save most of my thoughts on the movie for later but I will say I was Not disappointed. MatPat did well with this video all things considered.
question, if that police officer IS vanessa, then why did the notes in security breach mention her not having the "qualified experience of a building this big."
the fifth kid is the puppet, sweater gives him away😁
Anyone else here after watching the movie?
He knew everything all along...
i couldn’t find this video because i was looking for it on game theory 😔
The fact mat played a role in this movie and basically knew the entire plot from the beginning, making small changes in his theory here so that the video won't be a huge spoiler is genius.  Anyone complaining he spoiled the movie should consider that everything mat said was basically just basic trailer assumption and the overall fnaf stereotypical lore.
He is in the movie!!! Everyone in my theater screamed MATT PATTTTTTT!
Well appears you were wrong lol
Anyone just start watching this right after we finish watching the movie?
Imagine (since the movie goes with the books sorta) the blonde haired kid is cassidy (a boy in the books) and garett, mikes brother being evan or cc
So MatPat was bullshitting in this video huh
yall dont pay attention he didnt write this script
So just got out of the movie and we were played like a fiddle
8 years later...
Who’s here after watching the movie? Was so glad to see MatPat in it and have him say “theory” man 🥹
The Nebraska thing was taken way too far 😭
Lol You cheated you were in the movie 😂 Have a good day
I am watching the fnaf movie and you are a legend for getting into the movie
Do you know what’s funny I use Google meet to talk to my friends on android because I have iOS and we can’t use FaceTime together, so thanks Matt Pat for sponsoring Google meet
It’s INSANE how accurate all of this was
I can't remember anyone's names but the kid being kidnapped there looks like the kid that may or may not be a robot.
i knew you were coming in the movie this theory just didn't seem like you're usual shtick
You really nailed this lol
i love you
Having seen the film, I have to say that Lunch is now the most important meal of the day.
93/95
So why would you try solving the movie if you’re in it
Fnaf the avatar of theories lol
After coming back from the movie…dang. A lot of this is spot on.
How, How did you figure this out!!!!
As a nebraskan I'm proud that Mike wants my home state
HE WAS SO CLOSE TO WHAT THE ENDING WAS
Watching this now makes me feel lied to
Dog u are in de movie
When this video first dropped I was skeptical as a Nebraska native that Mike’s dream was to end up in Nebraska. But as the location of the trauma that changed his life?  Makes much more sense.
Bros in it
YOUR NOT TRICKING ANYONE BUD. YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE!
I wonder how long it takes matt to find out about vita carnis
BRO YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE-
Never even cared about it so I'm new
recently I've actually seen a theory that the cupcake was chica's soul's dog
I was so shocked to see you in the movie, you delivered an amazing preformance
whos watching this after finding out he was in the movie
y is there no book-theory? 🙀
This is how you know he already filmed his cameo B4 he made this 😂
Who’s watching this to see how much Matpat got right about the movie?
"i think we can figure out the movie" figure it out? You were in it. Lol
Watching this now knowing u made a cameo omgggg amazing and than the it’s just a theory sent me
I waited to watch this video until after I'd seen the movie just incase, just for Matt to be in the movie 😂
That basically what happened 😮
So about that.
ok but, how did he actually guess it?
It’s almost like he’s in the movie
Watched FNAF movie last night, I thought it was good.
Just saw the movie yesterday. When you showed up the theater just erupted in applause. It was amazing
Man. Wrong on all the important stuff, just like Mandela Catolog. Lol. Good theory, though.
Lots of stuff right, lots of stuff wrong.
You know that MatPat is popular if he got sponsored by Google
I think the lore on the wall of drawings is in the drawing with Springtrap. We can see a blonde girl in the drawing which the only blonde girl I can remember dying that would fit in the timeframe of the movie would be Cassidy AKA one of the two spirits in Golden Freddy. This would also work with the timeline as when William made Springtrap he also created Golden Freddy. Plus at the end of the movie there was an end credit message that was voice spelling "Come find me" which I think could be Cassidy or Crying Child because those are the two inhabitants of Golden Freddy.
He is William afton😊 and vanny is William’s daughter???!!!!
Who else is watching this after the movie came out
slight spoilers ahead!! - i watched the movie and then this and i was surprised by how on point matpat was tbh. he got so much right about the movie. i’m really looking forward to his video on the full movie
Little did we know, he didn’t do anything for this video
The Nebraska poster also could just be the day him and his family went camping and lost his brother. Just a memory he wants to solve so he got a poster. Idk js
just finished watching the movie and literally everything you said is tru
A lot of this theory is wrong 💀
You had us all fooled I was so happy to see u in the movie
Who’s here after seeing the movie
The unknown kid looks like he could be the puppet because of his shirt Even though the puppet is a girl it could be a twist by the movie creators Even though they don't show the puppet in the trailer it could be possible
Your apart of the movie
You deserved the role in the movie Mat Pat<3
The way he was so wrong about Nebraska
also, who's thinks matpat read the script for this movie, and changed enough of it to make it seem like he predicted it?? Not mad at all, but....  It's just a theory
He'd know, he was in it
Mat uhm why did u never tell me u were in the movie!?!
Matpat def earned his spot in the fnaf movie to say his catch phrase
karl killed himself 😭
Matpat needs to be the protagonist for the second movie bro
You were there for a second and now you are not😊
congrats on being a part of the movie :D
BRO YOU WERE IN IT WHAT
IT"S JUST A THEORY
This movie was awful
I GOT SO EXITED WHEN U APPEARED AS A WAITER IN THE NEW FNAF MOVIE!  Im also impressed how close you were to the actual movie, and i love how the film crew let you say your iconic line "but thats just a theory "
Our entire theater clapped for you,  You are him.
you and Corey did a good job on the movie
just saw you in the movie LOL❤❤❤❤
You are in the movie congrats!
It’s just a theory
XDDD Yeah, you "solved" it.
Guys MatPat is in the FNAF movie and he says our favourite line "It's just a theory "
I just came back from movie. I have seen you matpad
I’m sure you’d know  CONSIDERING YOU PLAY IN IT
Im so happy he actually got a role in the movie and that he did his theory greatly!
Look, I watched it so good try but some is not correct😢
the person who kidnapped garret was correct steve being afton was correct but they did have a baby sitter that went to go bust up the place but died also vennesa is aftons daughter
i got an ad of the movie in the middle of this 😭
Bro, your in the FNAF movie
garret is cupcake.....
You cheeky little theorizer you!
Your prediction would be better suit for the movie. Scott prolly hanged it last second, like he always does because of you.
lunch is the best meal of the day, but thats just a theory
My boy is in the movie
Oh Mathew, you were so wrong.
Saw your cameo in the movie! When I saw you while I was watching at home on Peacock, I shouted: “IT’S MATPAT!! MUSIC MAN!!! (In your way of saying it)” Totally well deserved getting a cameo in FNAF! 😊
Amazing
Ya’ll think Matpat got this wrong on purpose so we wouldn’t catch on that he’s in the movie?
"wait thats mat??" was my reaction when seeing the scene hah
watching this after seeing the movie. nice
THE ASKING IF THE JOB OFFER WAS AVAIBKE LOOKS LIKE THE FNAF THE MUSICAL ONE 🤨
A month later after the movie came out and he was in the movie
I think its funny how he made this because he was in the movie working as a waiter at a diner. They even let him say "but that's just a theory" and that's how i knee it was him.
Bro spilled the whole movie
Bro is in fnaf
The fact he was pretty much spot on is INSANE
you were in the fnaf movie🍕
Is this a really fair if you were in the movie? 😂😂😂😂😂
This doesn’t video doesn’t count for obvious reason😂
After now watching the movie, he was close and I wish the ending was baby and he had golden Freddy then lost it. He was so close
At the end of the FNAF movie it spells "COME FIND ME"
Isn't the last child the crying child his outfit looks familiar
The man who finds Easter eggs has become the Easter egg
That was dang near spot on
Your ad gave me flashbacks... To a former classmate who made a 87-slide ppt on TRIGONOMETRY.  Why I'm bringing it up?  Same guy left the school in style, left mid-year to move to Texas and, between taking 5 AP classes in middle school and memorizing pi to 1000 digits for fun... Man made a ppt imitation of the entire computer system of the school, and got all computers except the vice principal's.  He even rigged internals so hitting the power instead triggered back to 'slide 1'.
At the end of the movie it says "come find me" in an anagram.
This was really good vid but pretty off
Who’s here after the movie to see if he’s right
I'm glad i did not watch the trailer for this one
I saw you in the move
Just watched it, not gonna spoil everything, but what if the little brother is the dilapidated golden Freddy
HOW'D YOU GET THE MOVIE ALMSOT PERFECTLY-  I just watched it yesterday and this is EXACTLY the ending... tho abby didn't get turned in baby
The movie is out and I’m waiting on your post about the movie and the theory.  Don’t keep us waiting to long. 😉 So many questions unanswered
It’s funny when I’ve watched the movie then see this video he has most of it right but I’m not gonna spoil it
SAW YA IN THE MOVIE YOU'RE EPIC
Bro was IN the movie😭
Nope that was a freddy mask
You made me miss 10 seconds of dialogue due to your appearance
man how dafuq r u gonna make a theory about a movie ur in
how was he literally 90% right about this
i have a question. You said that there is to spirits possessing golden freddy and mike's brother is a part of golden freddy but if the blond kid was also a part of golden freddy  Ps. i love your videos :D
MatPat, thank you. When I saw you in the movie I felt a sense of joy I hadn’t felt in a long time. Despite being with a bunch of other college students, I was jumping up and down like a kid after the movie. You mean the world to this community and we love you
MATPAT WHAT WERE YOU DOING IN THE MOVIE?!
YOUR IN THE MOVIE 😨!
After watching the actual movie I’m sure of this theory and I think it’s pretty obvious: William (Steve) when he got springlocked right before dying said “I always come back.” Of course the epic line, but then he puts on the helmet even though that’s an obvious death. But he knew that. He put it on so he would die in pain and agony, that is also what creates remnant. He decided to die so he could come back. Showing that the death was intentional. He really is proven to be a genius, it’s subtle but still.
@FilmTheory I think the 5th kid could be puppet because he has a long sleeve stripped shirt kinda reminded me of the puppet’s arms with the stripes.
You are in the movie!!!!!!!!!
😤 Matthew Matthew Matthew... I saw the movie! NO WONDER WHY YOU'RE NEARLY SPOT ON
MATPAT YOU WERE IN THE FNAF MOVIE! I mean you were only the waiter but...
MatPat        you didn’t tell us about you appearing in the movie in this theory!
Aint no way blud dropped a food theory Easter egg inside the movie🤯
“it’s just a theory” YOU SNEAKY LITTLE MAN
Markiplier was supposed to appear in the movie but his schedule with his iron lung movie conflicted with the FNAF movie's filming schedule and he couldn't make it. I still like to think he's there somewhere tho
Just watched and came here
MatPat is IN the movie. Congratulations, Man.
mat ‘it’s just a theory’ pat
Saw the movie just now, so suprising how this guy just not only solved and revealed the plot for this whole movie but also understood the main plot for the next movie. Fantastic.
That Chaca in the thumbnail looks really like that one roblox face..
I mean yeah... cuz yOURE LITTERALLY INIT
How did you get in to the fnaf movie
You should get for different people like you won one another one on one and then another one on one and then another one on ones that would be a great
I actually yelled Matpat when you where on scene I loved when you said theory in your line
Dude he is spot on with most of these theories
HOW MUCH DID YOU ALREADY KNOW. (also clearly they gave too much away in the trailer) THIS THEORY WAS TOO EASY
Mat pat my brother is a huge fan and we watched the fanf movie yesterday and he actually screamed MAT PAT and just started laughing and I thought everyone was looking at us so I was kind of embarrassed
Hey I cant believe that you actually made it into the movie me and my family were surprised😂
AND YOURE IN IT! I SAW IT YESTERDAY
Matpat where tf was the remnant at in the fnaf movie man
But that’s just a theory, A LUNCH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY THEORY (if you get it don’t tell anyone)
Congrats on getting a part in the movie
Remnant wasn’t a thing in the movie maybe in the 2nd where mark is gonna show up in, hopefully
Hey I saw you in the movie
He got half of it right
Hey, welcome to Sparkies! Can I set you guys up with some appetizers?
MattPatt was in the movie and tried to act like he "called" the plot. Like you didn't get any details on set 😂
MatPat when I saw you in the movie I freaked out…and then when you said theory 🤯 hopefully you’ll be in the sequel to 😂
Crazy how this is like 80% accurate to what happens in the movie
YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE!!!!
MATPAT YOUR IN THE MOVIE WHAT WHAT WHAAAAA
After watching the movie, I just realized that Mike punched that kid’s dad because he thought that he kidnapped his brother 😭  ALSO, COMPLETELY SPOT ON WITH THIS THEORY BRO, BASICALLY EVERYTHING YOU SAID IS CORRECT (I also loved seeing you cameo in the movie bro, everyone in my house was laughing and screaming. “But, it’s just a theory” SO FREAKING ICONIC
He was literally in the movie
Wow for someone who didn't watch the movie it was really close I'm glad I watched this after seeing the movie and not befor
I SAW YOU IN THAT MOVIE
I’m so glad I decided not to watch this video before I saw the movie because pretty much everything was right 😭   my date was still annoyed I was telling her every plot twist 30 minutes before it happened tho
matpat rlly travelled to the fnaf universe to work at a restaurant to find more fnaf lore
Congrats on the in movie cameo!
Aren’t you in the FNAF movie dude
I asked at some point did they removed the scene that made fnaf bad bcuz i just watched it and the ending was normal and a jumpscare and theres no"together we are fnaf"it looks like ppl lied... also nice theory❤
Congrats on the cameo!! I flipped out when I saw you and when you said “it’s just a theory” I died happily lol
loved you cameo mat
Yall he was in the movieeee
When I saw you in the diner my soul left my body I was so excited😂
When I saw him in the movie I was like yo ooooooo
Just finished the movie and it's insane how accurate some of these theorys are😂
i think someone is acting like they’re not in the movie 🧐 hmmmm
stop messing around waiter. we will not gonna eat
I didn't believe you for a second! Knew you would be in it
Blud's a waiter 💀
Matpat....
after seeing the movie i can confidently say this was 100% wrong and he knew that
WAS SOMEONE IN FNAF I WONDER WHO
as usual, you got most of it right
the fact he plays in the film
i was genuinely shocked the moment MatPat actually appeared as a cameo in the FNAF Movie, I can't imagine how hard the urge of him to say that iconic line in a normal tone (Spoiler: he says "its just a theory" in the movie)
I just watched the movie, and I applaud your ability to fool us all into thinking you wouldn't be in it. I genuinely launched from my seat when I saw you
who’s here after the movie already came out
Your in the FNaF 🍿 movie 😮
@GTLive I seen the movie literally 10 mins ago… but I won’t spoil anything… you know what I’m talking about matpat 😁
Bro I thought the kid was the crying child cause of his shirt lol
So happy when I saw you in the movie! Was so combined you weren’t gonna be in it I felt so upset that they wouldn’t include you when you practically built this franchise alongside Scott   So when you showed up  The whole theater was practically screaming your name
Homie was in the movie
I saw you mr Matpat, I saw you at the FNAF movie as a waiter in "sparkly"
Matt You Have Some Explaining To Do?!?!? 😂😅
DUDE! could have warned us!!! I SCREAMED the loudest "YES" in my LIFE when I saw you pop up! Fkin amazing, man.
I have never heard of FNAF and only the bad critics reviews peak my interested and I will goes see it soon.
clap in a half for mat for making the big screen👏🎬
Your cameo was one of the best scenes in the movie
If Mike has a sister and vennesa says that will is her father how dose that work be cause  there was only one dauter
I am still confused
It would not be shocking if someone that was not good ol will kidnapping  a child it would be impossible
It was not the start they Brok in trying right get Mike fired
MatPat would be the person that would get up during the movie and shout "That's not true!"
WE KNOW YOU ARE IN THE MOVIE WE SAW IT!
Solved the movie, mat ur in the movie
Request:101 dalmatian high school theory these aren't DALMATIANS
I literally just watched the movie and omg your cameo, like I recognised your voice and then me and my brother literally screamed! 😂 It was amazing.
I'LL NEVER STOP LOVING BREAKFAST AND YOU CAN'T MAKE ME!
I saw it!!!! It's so good!!!
I watched the movie today but I need help,is Mike,Micheal Afton bc I know he is in the games but him and William don’t connect
Bro the jumpscare in the intro actually scared me
good to see Mat Pat in the Movie 👀, really surprised me :)
Matpat is so funny when in the shop you say it’s just a theroy
Yall man its crazy how he's in the film
after whatcing the movie ,  this was surprisingly  accurate!
Wait, wait, wait, wouldn’t this be game theory? Well it’s from a video game,five nights at Freddy’s,and it’s just confusing but you do you and I love your videos and I have watched every fnaf theory on your channel about 2 times. Markiplyer:IS THAT THE BITE OF 87?! Me:it’s 83 not 87, 87 was a bite by toy foxy,mangle,
I'm so glad I didn't watch this video before the movie, because a lot of this is very accurate.
U NEVER TOLD US U WERE IN THE MOVIE😁😁😁
Broo matpatt, (spo😮iler)  matpatt is ain the movie
lower left of the golden bunny suit drawing you see baby getting scooped.
Matpat was wrong with the theory of the 5th kid being the cupcake because vennesa says that the kids bodies are in the animatronic and cupcake is to small tho he might be right about chicka transfering her soul to the cupcake
Just saw the movie and congrats MatPat for being on the bog screen.
i was very surpised to see you in the movie. all the cinema was cheering when you showed on the screen
SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT  So... I noticed at the end of the movie, if you stay all the way until the end of the credits, there's a voice that spells out like it did in the older minigames. I heard it as 'COME FIND ME' and have been trhing to figure out what it means. Hopefully this is picked up in the next video on the movie
But he said that’s just a theory in the movie
Idk if anyone has said this yet but it hit me after watching the movie. Steve Raglan is a random name for William Aftons cover up when they could have taken the name from the silver eyes trilagy but Mathew lillard other than his role in scream is well know for Shaggy (norville) rogers, what if Steve raglan was a Easter egg for his role as shaggy as both initials are both S.G…
Bro I saw you in the movie
we need a film theory on the lore of the waiter from the fnaf movie
IM SO HAPPY OF YOUR CAMEO!!!! YOU DESERVE IT 🥹
He's in it
matpat is in the movie
The cinema is full of FnF nerdy clapping and shouting when Matt shows up.
HAPPY AND CHEEERED WHEN I SAW U THERE BROO RJIDJROSI
Saying Hi from Malaysia, 28th October   The whole crowd cheers when we saw Matpat Omgggg!!!!!!
I only now realized that they invited you onto the movie, congrats Matt! Your biggest appearance so far I think 👌
matpat is going insane bro
“Couldn’t afford a babysitter”… well yes… and no
Someone help me beg Matpat for a Good Omens theory please
yo mr matpat i'm in australia so i just wanted to say that i saw you in the movie on 26th October which is opening day here yeah "lunch is the most important meal of the day"
its not completely accurate cuz when i watched the movie it waS A  bit different
LIAR
This movie was amazing it was so great to see mat pat in a franchise hes theorized about for years
Pretty much solved it
This man was IN THE MOVIE and made up a whole fake theory
Just a theory
So I just watched the movie and I wanted to come back to this theory. And obviously something he got right and some things he got wrong. But, I will say, MatPat can take a victory lap on this one.
YOURE IN THE MOVIE
Me and my friend with her dad (and another friend) are watching fhe movie today and we're not even old enough so wish us luck
matpat is in the movie yaalll
I think that the last odd kid is post to be Chris afton the crying child
YOU
its just a theory
I’m from October 28 spoiler he is in the movie WHY DIDNT YOU TELL US?
I'm watching this on the day it came out and it never seizes to amaze me how he always manages to predict the movies entire outcome
MF REALLY TOLD US THE PLOT OF THE MOVIE AND DRESSED IT AS A THEORY EPISODE 💀  Well played, matpat. Well played.
I just watched the movie, it’s scary how much mat predicted. Almost the entire video was correct.
the way you played in our faces
Anyone recognized him as the waiter? I recognized it mainly when he said the word “theory”
The gear weapon thingy kinda reminds me of the scooping room put like a portable version
Wait there going to come out with a fnaf cook book. So we might get fnaf lore on 3 of your channels now???
Spoiler alert he’s in the movie 😂😂
Y’all btw This is a spoiler but matpat is IN the movie and he says in the movie something about a theory
I came back from my local movie theatre and everyone on the scene with you in it everyone started cheering
Hello world. I just wanted to say, some spoilers from the fnaf movie.                        Ok, so. I ALMOST SCREAMED IN THEATER WHEN I SAW MATPAT IN THE MOVIE. MATPAT PRESENCE MADE THE MOVIE FROM 100 TO INFINITY
i loved the part when he said "its just a theory" in the movie
matpat u said u weren't in it you liar
(spilers)so the boy who leads the mascots to springtrap. like the pixel mini game is the cup cake... (crying child ripperoni)
Bro he’s in the movie I did not expect that😲
Congratulations on being in the movie
It kinda crazy how it’s like 80% accurate lol
Bro,you appeared in the movie dude.I genuinely was surprised.I mean,it was a minor role but boi
I'm happy to say I'm an OG fan from 2014 🐻🎩🍕📽
Dude you're not theorizing here...you're in the movie! 😂🐻🎩🍕📽 Diner boy!  You already know what was gonna happen! You're using your knowledge and posing it as a theory 😂
I have a theory. You know more than youre letting on and subverting little expectations as to not raise suspicion that you wete involved in the movie. Just a theory. Also, you're use of "clown" to describe Baby was a bit on the nose. I mean, you've discussed whether she is clown or court jester before and implied those two titles' differences only to use the word clown at the end of your video. You're either convinced this is the term used to describe her OR you know about the other animatronics in the fil that were not the core four/five. There was an animatronic that could only be described as "clown-like". To be clear to it is not specified to be a clown now Baby but its features were undeniably clown-like as a background animatronic in a pile of scrap. P.s. this isnt a spoiler and there atrre a few piles of scrap with things that stand out in them. Though, I'm goofing over the end of your vid. Gn
Came here after the movie and yea it had a kind of happy ending 💀
Spoilers, Mat Pat is good at taking food orders
The amount of stuff that Matt got right is insane I with I could put things together like him
I saw the movie, and it looked like it was rushed
Mabye the blonde kid is the puppet bc of the striped shirt and also he is the only one who talks to mike or anyone
potential spoiler alert:     I watched this in the cinema last night and I think matpat went slightly wrong claiming that the little girl in mikes dreams was chica. My first thought was that she is cassidy and she is golden freddy and the boy with no markers is chica.  Now this is just a theory and I will admit that my understanding of the events and story is limited, good enough to get real enjoyment out the movie but bad enough to not understand most of the really complicated stuff so i could be talking out the wrong side here but thats honestly my guess.
Spoiler;      so that one animatronic they tried to lure Abbey in did in fact look a lot like Baby. That end slice is either really nail on the head or everyone's favorite diner is trolling us
MatPat, even here in germany, the loudest moment in the cinema was when you appeared on screen. MUCH LOVE AND GRÜßE
I watched it last night
I hope you do an updated version/new version comparing your theory to the movie, and what happened, and then a video of what you think will come or happen in the 2nd one
The theory no one figured out was the fact that Mat Pat would be in the movie himself knowing all the lore 😮😮😮
The fact how this is so accurate after watching the movie
MATPAT YOU LIED AND IM KINDA HAPPY ABOUT IT 😭
hes acting like he wasnt in the movie😂
After watching the movie, It's cereal of how much Mat called and got right and yet also got wrong. I'd say its a good 50/50 split
Can't believe you were in the movie, it made it so much more bearable haha. Hope they paid you well!
You were great in the movie
im gonna steal your shmeckles matpat
Here after the movie. The way MatPat just theorizing and getting the movie right 100% is astounding. I literally screamed when MatPat came on screen, my family was very concerned lol. I hope he makes a game theory episode about the updated timeline on what's canon and what's not, I have SO many questions
you got the twist a month befor
5th kid is a CUPCAKE lol
0:36 you know what that means FISH 🐟
HES IN THE MOVIE
AT THE END OF THE END CREDITS A DIGITAL VOICE SAID LETTERS AND NUMBERS IN THE MOVIE MATPAT PLEASE REFERENCE THIS
Watched the movie today and everyone was going crazy! When MatPat showed up. Cheering and clapping all together. Never thought that many people would have recognized him in my hometown.
マットパットがFNAFの映画に登場！
Why did you tell us you were not inside the that movie when you really were
You're the most brilliant troll ever MatPat. Glad to see Scott finally gave you your well deserved dues. Love you and your work, keep it up king
This guy looks like the waiter on the FNaF movie
Congrats on the acting gig in the movie
Not bad, some was really on point frfr
Which part?
U solved the movie ur in
hey bro i went to the premiere yesterday in Chile and the whole room screamed when you appeared in the movie 😭😭 what a moment
Exactly correct as alwaus
I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE MOVIE, MATPAT IM SO HAPPY YOU WERE IN IT ❤❤❤❤ EVERYONE IN THE THEATER SCREAMED
Man so much of this is plain wrong
HE SPOILED IT :(
ITS JUST A THEORY (i just got back from the movie, we all cheered bcuz we love you matpat)
in all honesty i thought that mike shmidt(idk how to spell it) was michael afton... Somehow you almost nailed it before it even came out.
I wonder why he knew a lot maybe BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE MOVIE but that’s just a theory a fan theory
at the end of the post credits like the final final he says some letters im wondering what they mean
Aww, what a good "theory!" Isnt that right, "Ness?"
Just watched it muhahahahha
Hey Matt, Pat, I saw you in for naff movie. You did really good.
Yeah because you played in the fnaf movie 😂
what i loved most of the hints of the movie they added scrappy
*Spoilers for Movie*    MatPat you absolute legend. We knew you were going to make a cameo but as the waiter?! And you even managed to say your famous line! The cinemas was a *riot* when the iconic moments came up; all the clapping, cheering  etc. That movie is something to remember in the franchise.   (There was also ghost face and puppet at the back.)
I Was So Happy To See You In The Movie 🤎🤎🤎
MatPat, like many others in the comments have said, our theatre cheered loudly once we saw you on screen, and once again even louder when you said "just a theory". congrats
LIAR  LIAR PANTS ON FIRE
As a person who just watched the fnaf movie you are pretty close to the movie plot.
I just had a viewing party to watch the movie and i just wanna say it was so heartwarming seeing you in it. You made such a big impact on the series and my childhood. Thank you 🫶🏻
I’m rewatching this theory after watching the movie and I gotta say (Spoilers)       Omg I loved your cameo and I was looking down and heard your voice and just looked straight up and whispered,” Omg it’s matpat” I loved your cameo so much I could rewatch it over and over
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Or is that just a theory Matpat?
Good job on being in the fnaf movie
Re watching this theory after watching the movie.
I cannot believe you would have us believe you didn't have an appearance in the movie Mathew Patrick! I am very upset and disappointed!!
The movie came out today and I can’t wait for the theory to be fixed up. It’s so cool to see how much he got correct though! And I loved his camino my entire theater cheered
everyone cheered for you at the theater. i was so happy when you made a cameo.
I love that your a waiter in the fnaf movie. All hail Matpat the fnaf king
I think the blonde 5th kid is marionette and brother garret is golden Freddy
the funny thing is that he predicted and was a cameo in the movie
Watching this video after the movie it is Insane how much he got right but he did get some wrong he still did alot before it came out
Everyone got so excited seeing your Cameo in theatres the whole audience reacted just got home :)
We also know based on casting that you’re in the movie. Which [SPOILER] explains how you get this so accurate
Turns out the blond kid was Cassidy  IDK what's going on with the cupcake
He was right with the brother being kidnapped by Springtrap.. 😭🙏🙏🙏 8:22
I jumped out my seat when I saw matpat as the waiter
Never mind the kid who you claimed to be the cupcake is Freddy (spoiler)
Just saw the movie, it was awesome!
Cassualy watching this after the movie to see how accurate it was 😂😂😂
Mat pat is in the fnaf movie
New rule. You’re not allowed to spoil a movie before it’s been put out. Or if you’re in it.
I saw you in the movie… YOU WERE SO GOOD I WAS SHOCKED
Your in the movie
bro rlly said “my best guess” for everything like he wasn’t in the movie. smh he got us good
Holy moly
Matpat was partially  correct, he was in the movie too... He tricked the algorithm
Just watched the movie a few minutes ago and I am 99.99% sure you are correct ✅
How did he just guess it all?
YOU WERE IN THE FNAF MOVIE!!!?!?!????
The fact that matpat was in the movie AND he was just a waiter at a restaurant and that’s the o my time he shows up is just phenomenal
Not too far off mat~ Now finish the theory
Oh my god he was exactly right.
MatPat i saw you in the fnaf movie
Honestly I think he didn’t know much. With the directors knowing him and what he does, they probably gave him the Tom holland treatment with censored scripts and restricted set access.
do you guys prefer breakfast or lunch?
Matpat you cheeky little—
YOU'RE IN THE MOVIE!!!!! JULY TO MEEE!!!
Pretty accurate, Matpat. Almost as if you were tipped off…
Here watching after watching the movie- you got 98% of that correct
IM WATCHING THIS AFTER I WATCHED THE MOVIE CUZ I DIDN'T WATCH TO HAVE ANY SPOILERS       OMG IT WAS AMAZING and matpat is kinda right and wrong
IT ME !!!!
Aren’t you in the movie?
Why didn’t you tell us you were in the movie Matpat 😂
Of course matpat knows. He's in the movie- matpat cannon!?  Matpat is finally a cannon character in FNAF- as well as Cory
Let's face it your fnaf theory  videos have become canon.
got back from the movie and i don’t have good news…
Lunch is the most important meal I thought that was breakfast Thats just a theory
Home boy was a waiter
Why did you not tell us you was in the fanf movie..... you know more then you say forsure
Omg I loved ur cameo in the movie, the entire theatre was clapping and screaming
Matpat explain right now. I watched the Five Nights at Freddy's movie and you are in it. Make sure you did or did not already started trying to look for Clues when you were on the set possibly. But you're in the movie and I definitely know that you're going to do a theory on this. Please tell us give us the Deeds!!!
The only good thing about the movie was seeing you in it and the fact fnaf got a movie... It's sad everything else was a narrative mess, filled with lore references but a whole bunch of winks doesn't make a good movie... What did Vanessa have to do with the fnaf first game, the bite was done a disservice when it's so important a random woman gets bitten... The whole Garret thing and Abby... Dunno I respect people liking it but the facts are the changed the whole storyline and even did a silly villain reveal at the end. It felt like I was watching a fanfiction when I was expecting something entirely different after following all of your theories. I love the lore and that's exactly why I didn't like it. (Been reading people saying only true fans will like it)  It's cool fnaf got a movie but if people are comfortable praising mediocre takes, they'll only keep getting mediocre movies...  I'm happy for Scott, but his involvement in the movie and him agreeing with the outcome made me way more disappointed and frustrated.  How are they gonna do sequels comfortably if they already revealed everything as if they were using a spoon to feed us? It sent a msg like it was the only one it's going to exist and thus why they crammed what they could in it...   Anyways, kudos to you Matt it was really awesome seeing you appear ❤
Loved you in the film Matt ❤❤
YOU WERE IN IT HWAT
Please do a video about that FNAF movies, we need your explanation, like why were the main characters so nice to the security guard?? I thought they hated adults?? And Vanessa?? The daughter of the serial killer we know and love??!!
Bro for real added a few in accurate theorys to make the audience think he's not in on the movie!
How did he predict the entire movie??? It’s almost like he might have been in it…
When I saw you on the screen THE ENTIRE THEATER freaking exploded with both laughter and “it’s just a theory”’s and when you said it everyone cheered! Congratulations MatPat, you’re a  star
after watching the movie, (spoiler alert) good job matpat :) 8:15
HE WAS SOO CLOSE and he got it wrong
A pass saw you in the movie I saw way
Never thought you were ganna be in the movie as a waiter
Bro i just wachted the movie
I just got done with the Movie and Spoiler MattPatt is in it and I Love how he is congrats Matt
It makes this all the more better when he is in the movie😂
I just saw the movie and bro was like 90 percent correct all except for Abby
no
You didn’t solve it, your in it
MY THEATER WENT WILLDDD BRO LIKE DEFENING SCREAMS WHEN MATT PATT SHOWED UP
YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE AAAAAAAAA
Your in the movie
YOU WERE IN THE FNAF MOVIE YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE SLICK
He's in the movie
Bro just got out of the movies and everybody was cheering really loudly when matpat came out 😂 I couldn’t hear a single word
I was really happy to see you in the movie, buddy. ❤
SPOILER ALERT:       15:28, i actually thought the kid was the cupcake at first, but nope, he was golden freddy lol. It's also interesting to see how much MatPat got right. I was surprised when it was revealed that William Afton was the career counselor, and here MatPat is guessing it simply from the trailer and comments made by the actors. I gotta say, I'm impressed.
The movie was amazing. Too bad mark wasn’t in it. Also, It seems like he got the movie theory pretty spot on. I wonder if he was like in it or something
Congratulations on the cameo. You earned it! <3
👩 😂
SO CLOSE, MATPAT YUR IN THE MOVIE U SHOULD KNOW!!
I had to describe what happened in the movie to my mum even though I was watching it with her lol
Why does the kid have an Instagram
Bro knew what to lie about because he got in the movie
My birthday
you are
Why are you I the movie
Hey matpat your right lunch is the most important meal of the day but that’s just a theory 😉😉
Anyone else going to talk about HOW HE’S ACTUALLY IN THE MOVIE????
Good I’m not the only one coming to this video after seeing him on screen
All I'm gonna say is MatPat you cheeky dawg
I watched the movie at home but I can still say the crowd went wild went this man came on screen 😂😂
Who else just came back after watching the movie to see what he got right 😅
You got to be in the movie 🎬 and I am so happy for you 🎉🎉🎉

Congrats on the movie! 🎉

MATPAT OMG THE CROUD WENT WILD WHEN YIU CAME UP. ITS INSANE HOW LONG THEY WHERE CHEERING THEN WE ALL SAID “BUT THATS JUS A THEORY” AS YOU  SAID IT!! IT WAS AWSOMEEE
Matpat you were in the movie! U didn’t theorize this u knew about it!!😂
Bruh they did MatPat dirty and made him a waiter for some random ahh restaurant
I find it funny that Matpat made a whole theory on this and KNEW he was gonna be in the movie.
I love how he's wrong❤
so are thay coming up with a fnaf movie 1 2 3 4 becus ther is 4 fnaf games
I had finished this movie and I was literally shocked that MatPat was actually in this movie! The movie was okay, wasn’t as good
Welcome to Sparky's 😂, bro you killed playing that waiter
BRO WAS THE WAITER THE WHOLE TIME
Hey! Welcome to Sparky's.

Anyone here watching after the movie?
*spoiler*       Just saw the movie. Y Y YOU SAID THE THING😱😱
This if definitely JUST a theory. Lol Very clever MatPat. 👌
You were in the movie!
I came to your channel for FNAF then followed all your other channels for the curiosity, theories and science and now seeing you in the movie itself felt like a circle moment. I think i was the only one who recognized you in my theatre but i squealed like a fangirl ngl. It was a great for the theorists for sure.   If this turns into a movie franchise please convince them to have you make cameos like stanlee would definitely be one of the only reasons i turn up at the movies.
Check out right around 60 minutes into the movie, I swear I saw Golden Freddy or something flash onto the screen. The transition right after Mike says "who's controlling them?"
Lunch is the most important part of the day
(Spoiler’s)Ohhh my word 99.99%corrected  I just seen the movie and it is spot on 😂
this aged well 😂
Matt pat is in the movie
spoilers!!!             MATPAT WAS IN THIS MOVIE AND SPOILED HALF OF IT?! XD
feels weird watching this after the movie.
I think Garret is part of golden Freddy, and the “unknown” kid is the crying child, based off the striped shirt, and they still have two souls in golden Freddy
Matpat, you've got some explaining to do for illegally being in the movie the right way
Literally watched it 4 hours ago, when I saw you me and my friend looked at each other and started quietly cheering
He is in the movie
i am so proud of you matpat
I just got done watching the movie on Peacock and it was great! Recognized your voice right away and laughed so hard.
I just saw the movie Nebraska is for a different reason you learn of from the movie and is not the location
so you just weren’t gonna tell us you were in the movie?!
The fact that he's nearly perfect here (IT'S JUST A THEORY 😍)
I saw ya in the movie .  It was a great cameo
Steve Raglans purple tie is a giveaway of him being William Afton. Also the code to enter the Pizzeria can be unscrambled to say 1985 could that be the year this is set in which would place the MCI before that year
I just watched it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Spoiler*                             I SAW YOU!!!!!!!! YOU WERE THERE!!!!!
Tfw you watch the movie and it doesn't match up with the lore
we need a theory of who the handsome waiter in the diner was
It’s the guy from fnaf
My husband and I (along with the entire theater) loved seeing your cameo!!!
Watched the movie today it was great
Your In the MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow…you made a theory in a video you were in…this is crazy cool!!
just came back from watching the movie and OMG it was good !!! I've been a fan for a while, probably 2015-2016, but I only played the games for fun, I got really interested in the lore in 2017-2018!
It's crazy how spot-on the person who wrote the script is. He got some things wrong but the overall plot he got down
wow gotta say was surprised to see the cameo! But it makes sense haha. The movie guys must be thinking this guy got 90% of the movie predicted right
POV: you came back to see how accurate he was
"A" "I" "B".
After watching the movie I came back here to see what he got right and wrong and it is really interesting
That movie is fire
You got the whole plot right because YOU’RE IN THE MOVIE
MATPAT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US. I JUST SAW THE MOVIE, CONGRATULATIONS MAN. WE GOT SO EXCITED TO SEE YOU ON SCREEN
I bet you could work at a cafe... BUT THAT'S JUST A THEORY!
YOU ARE IN THE MOVIE
HES IN THE MOVIE
Me getting a FNaF movie ad in the middle of this video AFTER watching the FNaF movie: 👁️👄👁️
Coming back after today I am watching it right now matpat I saw you in the movie at the cafe in the movie
I love how he made this as if he wasn’t in the movie
bro is waiter
Just came back from the movie SPOILER:                                                     The fifth kid is golden Freddy
YAYAYYAYYAYA I LOVE YOUR PARTTT
Hey matt!! I just watched the new fnaf movie today! And me and a bunch of other people was so excited that you were in it even tho it was only a few minutes! And I love how you talk about a theory/say theory I so understand why they picked you but I love that movie kinda just because you're in it!!❤❤
The movie was mid 🫤
MAT DID IT HES IN THE FNAF MOVIE!!!!
That’s just a theory, a FILM THEORY THAT IM IN!!!
Just watched the movie. Was a pleasant surprise to see you in there as a cameo, I was freaking out when I saw you
Yeah solved it but yet where in it. Mat you’ve been so close to franchise I thought you would had cracked the code on it and start writing the the stories already by now but some how always a turn.
I smell you have Inside information :D
YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE
Bro ain’t no way he made a theory about a movie HES IN
hes trying his best not to tell people he is in the movie
FYI you are in the movie so be grateful that you are in the movie
You sly dog
congrats on getting the part in the fnaf movie! I saw in one of your lines you said "but its just a theory" and i got super excited!!!!!
actually surprised how accurate this is
I wonder why he knows everything
I SAW THE MOVIE YOU SAID THE THING ALMOST HALF OF THE THEATERE STARTED FREAKING OUT NOT EVEN EXXAGERATING
Ju saw it, me and my friends all freaked out when we saw him
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE IN THE MOVIE OMGGGG
I guess the moral of the story is that Lunch is the most important meal of the day.
matpat your in the move!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I watched the fnaf movie and Mat is in it
MATPAT I NEED SOMETHING
I just finished watching the movie it was the best movie ever five nights at Freddy’s is the best
you did it I don't know how you did but you guess it
bros trying to act like he aint in this movie
MATPAT, YOU SON OF A GUN! If you know, you know.
Your in it
Bro is acting like he wasn't in the movie💀
Bro you didn’t have to even guess you’re in the movie 😂
Do you have any idea just how many people screamed “it’s just a theory, a game theory” when you appeared on screen in the movie 😂😂😂
MAT PAT YOUR LITERALLY IN IT IM SO HAPPY😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Well played...never saw you coming face-blue-smiling
BRO WAS IN THE MOVIE
You cheated you were in the movie
Bro there's letters at the end of the movie if you go fully through the credits
Now we need a end credit scene with mat pat just turning around in his chair at the pizzeria just saying “but that’s just a theory…..a DREAM THEORY”
Blud acted in the movie, & knew the script, & made a theory about it, thinking we wouldn’t notice💀
Bruh I just finished watching it and it was amazing but u got the ending wrong
This DID NOT AGE WELL! The part where he talks about the Nebraska poster posted up where he said that it probably references to Matt is correct, but what he said, next is totally wrong, thinking that it’s his dream place to go to, but it’s some thing else, something WAY opposite (no spoilers hehe)
Matpats in fnaf.  I’m so hyped love you man “its just a theory”fnaf movie
Matpat, we saw you. We know what you did. 😐
I JUST WATCH THE NEW MOVIE AND YOUR IN IT!!!
maybe the bite of 87 was the friends we made along the way
How do you sponsor a part of a video
Hi future anima here, i watched the real movie!
Welcome to sparky’s here On the menu there’s: LORE
Of course he had it solved he was in it!!!😂
Im literally watching the  fnaf movie and matpat being in it is just really amazing to see
Congratulations on being in the movie
Spoiler for the movie      BRO MATPAT'S SCENE WAS THE BEST (ALONG WITH  COREY'S SCENE WITH BB) AND HE MUST HAVE KNOWN THE WHOLE PLOT BUT DIDN'T WANT TO SPOIL IT! ALSO I'M SO GLAD THEY USED FNAF 1 SONG IN THE CREDITS! IT'S MY NEW FAVORITE MOVIE AND I DON'T CARE WHAT DUMB CRITICS THINK!!!!!
Matpat, I want you to know everyone in the theater saw your face and screamed very loudly in excitement. You made the movie even better
I just watched the movie and I can’t believe that you were in it
MAT YOUR IN THE MOVIE
Welp now that the movie is out I can’t wait for him to trash this video and make a new one
YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE!
Dude it was so awesome to see you make an appearance in the new FNAF movie. Amazing and well deserved MatPat
The funny thing is he always knew what the movie was about he was in it
Are you sure about that?
Where was the bite of 1983
I saw you on fnaf Matt!!
At the end of the end credits you can hear a voice say a series of letters  :The letters read  “come find me”
So you were in the movie, you knew what was gonna happen huh?
You were in the movie and you're doing a theory on it? YOU ALREADY KNEWWW
I KNEW MATPAT WOULD BE IN THE FNAF MOVIE!! AAAAAA
the reason why he put the poster is because william afton brought his younger brother away
he actually got most of it right
I just watched this movie like 20 minutes ago and I waited so long to wait to see this video and compare to see how close it was, it was amazing seeing Matpat on screen I couldn’t have asked for a better nostalgia movie with one of my favorite YouTubers
Man’s was in the movie
It seems like you cheated a little Matt...
I can a sure you the cupcake dose NOT involve in the dream you are right golden Freddy(I saw the movie)
Maybe the last kid is the crying child 15:16
Wow remnants
Already saw the movie
HE WAS IN THE MOVIE OMG!!!
MATPAT YOUR IN THE FNAF MOVIE  I SAW YOU
are you paid by the word?
So I went with a ton of friends and saw the movie it was amazing and the whole group laughed when you were on screen and I'm glad to see you in a great movie and the part was so good there were many "that's just a theory....a good therapy" jokes as FNAF jokes
Ahh how funny how everyone says that Freddy is in the back of the five kids
this guy completely fooled us in him not being on the movie
We were SCREAMING for you in the theater!!!! I WORE MY FNAF VARSITY JACKET FROM THEORYWEAR TOO!! We adore you dearly, MatPat!!🩷
Did you know that Clara name is Clara Shchmidt before she marry William Afton.
Hey Matpat you didn't tell us you played in the movie and the way you put but that's just a theory was so good.
Of course you solved the movie. YOU WERE IN IT.
Of course you know the it!!!!!!! ***Wink Wink***
Now returning to this video once i saw the movie SPOILER ALERT!!!          I'm really happy to see your cameo on the movie, with your iconic line, you truly deserve it after all this years of entertaining content of fnaf, solving mysteries, losing your mind over it, (especially with the books),  all tho i woul've like it you had a great role like been a detective  or smothing , but its still great to see you be part of it understanding all the complications about making theorys, in part of most of your suscribers,  we hoped you enjoyed being there and the movie, and all that, and keep doing  the great job than you do)  PD: this should be in game theory, but after all this is a film.... A FILM THEORY with all the love of your subs! @FilmTheory
Bro your in  the fanf movie
Really did get most things correct. Nice
Bro Mat Pat you are IN the FNAF movie
I’m here after the movie he’s pretty much 100% accurate
matpat as a waiter 💀
I never comment on anything, you were my favorite part of the FNAF movie, the fact that the writers let you say “that’s just a theory” made me rewind to watch it again. I have never made it through a run but keep up the lore through you, keep it up and keep the SPF LOW ;)
Hey your FILM THEORY is right on most accounts but off on some others but I cant wait for fnaf 2! Omg this movie met my expectations, as a long time fan im so happy with it
You were so good on the The Fnaf movie!!!
Good job in your role in the moive
I saw the movie today I really liked it. I think I screamed a little when I saw Mat Pat's cameo I was so happy. I don't understand why the movie got so much hate and low ratings I really really enjoyed it. I really want a second movie. ❤❤❤❤
I JUST WATCHED THE MOVIE YOU BREAKFAST MOVIEST
REPENT FOR YOUR SINS JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON AND BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST AMEN ❤️🙏❤️❤️🙏❤️❤️💖🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️💖🙏💗💗💗💗
IF YOU TURN TO JESUS CHRIST HE CAN SAVE YOU REPENT FOR YOUR SINS AMEN

MATPAT WHAT ARE U TALKING ABOUT UR IN THE MOVIE U HAVE THE SCRIPT
Mat, I love how right and wrong you were on this theory. Congrats on getting a cameo though 😌💕
Always watch but first time commenting,🧡Congrats on Being In The Movie, I Was Like Wow This Guy Sounds Way To Happy To Be At This Roadside Diner and the camera shows your face and I was OMG ITS YOU, Anywho CONGRATS AGAIN 💛DOM
Watch the movie
Congrats at being in the movie
He Guessed the half of the movie and the end almost close
So happy I saw you in the movie!!!!
You were in the bloody movie!
Who else came here after the fnaf movie to see what matpat got right?
Like half of it was wrong XD😂
JS WATCHED THE MOVIE
Just watched the movie this is pretty accurate
YOU AR IN THE MOVÌIIIIIIII ÄAAAAAAA
I was shocked when matpat said "I have a theory" but got ignored how dare they
Yep now matpats an actor
You ar in the movi
He guessed it because he was in it, he didn’t get told much but he saw enough, he got more info because he saw parts of the set.
And finally after years he can finally say it's just a theory a film theory 👏🥹
just seen it what a W movie, i dont get why people called it bad. Cause of the  “fort” thing? that was just to trick abby (Elizabeth i think) to think they are nice but later they try to put her in baby
I love how you're in the movie and still making content haha
were my theory
sir I watched the movie and I saw that one seen I love it
movie came out
um
Yall want spoilers?
Who’s here after the cameo? 👀
For the attention of post-fazfilm whatching people (Spoilers)                    Thank fazfunk, i thought this was going to be 100% accurate. I was afraid. Very afraid. Still got WAY too much right though even with the exposing adverts.
Matpat i watched the FNAF movie and at the end after all the names there is a msg COMEFINDME = COME FIND ME
You got all but the last part right 😮😮😮
we know your in the fnaf movie
ITS OUT TODAY
THIS WAS AN INSIDE JOB, YOU HAD ALL THE ANSWERS FROM THE START
Watching this after watching the movie feels weird 🤨
There are spoilers in the comments for anyone who hasn't watched it yet.
So did you keep us in the dark or did you request to have no knowledge outside of your scene so you were also left in the dark?   I think it’s time for GTLive Q&A
Cant wait for TODAY
I just reviewed the FNAF movie on my YouTube channel! I loved the cameo 😂
GUYS MATPAT WORKS AT A RESTURANT HE IS NO DETECTIVE SORRY
just saw the movie, i really liked it but i feel like there was quite a few plotholes especially with the time the movies set (i assume the early 2000s with the phones and computers) and i feel like the gore was really tame for a 15
the movie was actually really good
The poster was put there by Mike, it was the one from his bedroom, also I think that's where his brother was taken from since he stares at it every night before he sleeps, idk though, you're the theorist 😂 great cameo too 👍
Somehow couldn't see it when I saw the movie, but William is Shaggy right? Same actor? I could look it up..But eh. Seeing him in still images, it looks like him, just older.
i just watched the fnaf movie and i can say this is REALLLYYY close to the real thing!! if u havent seen the movie yet ur going to love it<3
How could he fit a child in a cupcake?!
WHY DIDNT YOU TELL US YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE
Now I'm just tryna guess where is Garett at this point
I just saw the movie, why were you a waiter?
The fact MatPat is in the film as the waiter is funny
bro everyone when you see the movie theres someone in there that your going to be suprised about
@MatPat 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  Seriously, congratulations 🎉🎈🎊🍾
Conveniently left out the part where you were in the movie
bro actually got every single bit right
Thats cause he is in the movie
Mat I love the line you played in the movie
Close tho
Nice cameo in the movie dude 👌
I just finished the movie your almost spot on
Golden Freddy isn’t even in the movie
Mat Pat being in a movie which he made in the og Game theorys about. Doing in that Film a food theory dressed as waiter  He got all his Channels in 10s im Happy for you that you had this oppurtunity🎉❤
Lunch is the most important meal of Day. But hey it's just a theory
Nice job being a reference! BUT FRICK that balloon boy!
Spoiler ahead⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️    1 month later  Hes in the movie  Congrats❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Spoilers          When he said "Thats just a theory" My whole cinema started to clap and cheer, truly    beautiful.
Scarily accurate
i just saw the movie. Im so proud of u Matt
bro did the ultimate troll
there's morse code for sure at the end of the movie with the welcome lamp and 2 others blinking, i hope you see this and decode it
Congrats on making it to the big screen, MatPat, we're all proud of you!
How much calories crying child?
MATTHEW ROBERT PATRICK YOU SNEAKY LITTLE WAITER 😂😂😂😂
Good to see you played a part in this movie
bruh "lets predict the movie a month before it screens" YOU WAS THERE!!!!
Congrats on getting your part IN THE MOVIE, literally made me so happy you were in it. Full on deserved it.
Just watched the movie yesterday (25th) and tbh you weren’t very far off on the majority of these things!!
MATPAT WAS IN THE MOVIE!!!!
Sparky’s!
DO A THEORY ON WHAT SCHLATT DID IN 1999
Was so giddy when I saw mat pat in the movie. Was like omg that's mat pat. Wife clueless. Why are u shouting 😂
Why did you lie  and say your not in the movie?? YOUR IN THE MOVIE
I loved you in the movie
Afraid to tell you that I already watched this two days ago, so I didn't see this before the movie even released, unfortunately.
MATPAT YOU LIAR!!!
I'm mid watching the movie, saw MatPat and freaked out. I needed to find a way to say. I am so so happy for you. And the "its just a theory", iconic!!
there is no movie in Ba Sing Se
MATPAT DIDN'T U PLAY IN THE MOVIE?
nowthat the movie has coe out and ive seen it. some of this is very on point while most of it is not.
omfg he actually guessed 40% of the movie
Bruh I'm over hear whatching the movie   CAN YOU TELL ME WHY TF YOUR IN IT you sed some welcome to sparkys
You were in the movie  I was shooketh
We shouldn’t be shocked it was Matthew Lillard. He killed all those kids in Woodsboro, and drove their bodies away in the Mystery Machine.
Matpat your CHEATER! You were in the movie so you had some insider information! You were wrong, but night 5 of the movie *spoiler warning*  We were lead to believe that Abby was going to get spring locked by.. an very Inaccurate Circus Baby. No faceplates, no ice cream creator, no Endo scooper. But it is a springlock suit. But Mike saved her last minute. With Matpat's Cameo in the Diner scene, he had some insider info while filming in Louisiana, yes, I did pay attention to the credits for any Easter eggs, like the 3rd ballon boy midway through the credits. I counted. This video was a genuine theory, since it was likely he didn't have ALL the info for night 5. But with the movie out now, I can say that he was ALMOST RIGHT
watched the fnaf movie and i cant believe i fail for it if uk uk 😭
Garrett sounds like Gregory
Guys he is in the film I have seen it
After the FNAF movie comes out, how about a deep dive into Over the Garden Wall all November?
I XANT BELIEVE MAT PAT WAS IN THE MOVIE!! I CRYIED WHEN I SAW HIM (CRIED AS IN SOMETHING GOOD) 🎉❤😂 love to the hole theory people there!!!❤❤❤
My favorite line from the Fnaf movie   “Hey it’s just a theory”   Good job on being a Easter egg in the movie
Bro was in the movie
I watched it and I loved it! Especially a sertain cameo
You were in the FNAF movie
You are in the movie and you never told us!!!!!!
I always thought breakfast was the most important meal of the day.
Congratulations on being in the FNAF Movie. You did great 👍🏼. That’s not just a theory, it’s a fact
All im saying is that i came back to watch this after watching the movie in a theater last night with my brother, my sister and my brother-in-law. So, yeah, lol
Hey MatPat just watched the movie and it was awesome! I love your cameo! But I have a theory that might be fun... A full theory of how many teeth has Chica's cupcake..
I JUST WATCHED IT!🤩  Edit: I dragged my dad a long and he was very confused, especially when we laughed at the kills and a sertain scene apeared.
Im pretty sure he acted in the movie
hmmm. the "if you think this movie has itself everyone smiling and living a happily ever after" aged well considering I seen the fnaf movie on the 25th of the 10th
i just came home from watching the movie and boy was he wrong
The real question is... how many teeth does Chica's cupcake have...
Lunch is the most important meal
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 bravo on that 5 second spots.
YOU LIED THROUGH YOUR TEETH
you nailed those 5 seconds 😭🤣
I actually thought that Matpat was gonna appear in the movie. I don't know how but something just told me!
Matt YOUR IN THE MOVIE
collect here if you came after watching the movie
Come find me.
MAT IS NESS
Anyone wants spoilers…?
Maybe because you are in the movie?
I WATCHED THE MOVIE AND I KNEW YOU WERE IN IT, YOU WANTED TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE YOU WERE DISAPPOINTED BUT I SAW RIGHT THROUGH YOU
Very close.  !SPOILER ALERT!         I wish he was right about his brother being golden Freddy, that would have been so much better. Not that the films bad, it's very good, I just think what matpat theorized would have been better.
🗣️‼️MatPat is in the fnaf movie🗣️‼️
Just watched the film, we need explaining, especially the spelling out of come find me at the very very end of the credits (plus the MatPat cameo)
Mattthew patthew you cheeky cheeky man
DUDE YOU'RE IN THE MOVIE
HES IN THE MOVIE I JUST WATCHED ITTT MATPAT EXPLAINNNNNN
you should've seen my face when I saw Matpat in the movie
I can't trust you anymore, you're too close to the case.
He did it. I can't believe it.
I’m gonna watch it tonight so I’ll see if he is fight
Might wanna do a recap on this on now that the movie is out.
I wish Matt part was my father
The fact he got almost everything right
Just saw the FNAF Movie,loved every moment! !Spoiler!          Everyone did a collective gasp when you appeared!
Pretty much nailed it
Bro was in the movie
I didn't want to watch this before the film... and we're watching, and there's MatPat!  So, breakfast is the most important meal of the day? Trying to promote Food Theory, maybe? 😂😂😂 (Sadly, no one else recognized you 😮 but I had to keep myself from writing this during the film! 😂)
What if he goes into Golden Freddy to fight spring trap, because at the end of the 1st trailer you can see golden Freddy and abby in the 🚕 and i dont think she would leave without her brother
I just watched the actual movie today 9/10
matpat congratulations in the new movie
Matpat is in the movie if you guys didn't know
BTW spoiler to the movie, hey film theory I have Peacock so I can watch the movie before it releases and um, YOU WERE IN IT!
i just saw the movie and watched this video again would recomend. sorry for grammer
just saw the movie best movie all year 10/10
now to see how accurate mat was
Movie Spoilers       The fifth kid was just simply Golden Freddy, it wasn’t that deep.
Coming from someone who just saw the movie yesterday… it’s scary how spot on you can be at times. ALSO HI MATT I SAW YOU IN THE FNAF MOVIE I SCREAMED
[Spoilers] I mean it if you haven’t watched the movie go away I’m going to spoiler some things     Vanessa, Being afton daughter WHAT! Does this mean that game Vanessa is also afton daughter or it’s this only for the movie also the I always come back is clearly a set up for the second movie balloon boy being in this movie is confusing me does this mean balloon boy come from five nights 1 or fnaf2
Welp fnaf is out and mat you were very close to what happened in the movie also wasn’t expecting to see you in it happy for you my guy
Who was also screaming when Matpat said its just a theory in the movie, I threw my popcorn at the Cinema, when i saw him Then Yelled to the top of my lungs when he said the thing. They did him justice fr fr
He was in it
MOVIE SPOILERS  Mf said “I solved the FNaF movie” BRO YOURE IN THE FNaF MOVIE!!   (I already saw this vid a month ago I just came back to make this joke bc I saw the movie the 26th)
So, the movie DEFINITELY just takes place after the first game. Not "fnaf 2" amounts of time, but a good 5 or 6 years, because the game implies you're working while the restaurant is closing down, but mike in the movie is working there well after it's been "abandoned"
The way he predicted most of the movie is crazy. This should be the evidence that his theories are correct
bro is ice cream
You are in the five nights at Freddy’s movie
you're in the movie, bro. congratulations.☺️🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉
*DO NOT WATCH BEFORE SEEING THE MOVIE!!!*   I tried not to watch any trailers but watched this sadly before the movie. Matt basically spoiled the whole movie and he’s in it. Love you Matt but this was excessive.
The screams were wild when everyone saw you ❤ you really gaslit us into believing you werent in it
Bro finally got too see the movie today, and the Diner scene almost took me out 😂 Matt you sly dog 😏
I saw the movie last night and a certain waiter caught my attention…  The whole theater was screaming when they saw!
You sly dog MatPat! I jumped out my chair, pointing like crazy & laughed so much seeing you! 😫🥹
YOUR IN THE MOVIE,I SAH YOU IN THE MOVIE
My Wife & I watched the movie  last night & you jumbled around but pretty much Spoiled the  entire movie & not mention your cameo.
I just saw the movie last night
I Have To Know What You Were About To Say About Breakfast And Lunch In The Movie, Over At Food Theory..
The fact that he basically told us the movie and most of us won't find out until after the movie
Just saw the movie last night, on opening night. I LOVED your part. I went crazy when you said "it's just a theory." 😂😂 Loved the movie, loved your cameo in it too!
I think we already know why he discovered the story, right?
I got to watch the movie a day early at my local theatre, very good movie with some great actors
Your in the movie that sickkkkkkk whyyyyy did u not telll ussss
nice cameo
YOU WERE RIGHT
5:17 Matpat kind of got it right, (Spoilers) Mike aka The Security Guard is trying to find who is the killer of his brother, (which is important of him)
THAT WAS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED IM SO GLAD THAT WASNT SPOILED FOR ME
I got a fnaf movie trailer while watching this . ”Coincincidence? I think not” 💀
Matpat is litterly in the movie
Well now we know why MatPat was 100 percent on this😂 he even tried to switch a few things up to make it seem like he was wrong. Mean while I want some lunch
wow matt so u WERE in the movie
U don’t gotta solve nothing matpat and u already know why😏
Just watched the movie. How the heck did Matpat solve this movie before it even came out?!?!
i loved MatPats part in the movie! i could hear all the people talking when we saw him on the screen it was so amazeing!
After watching the movie I have a theory, so spoilers below   I think Mike’s brother, Garret ended up possessing ballon boy.
you silly goose
I just watched the movie and all matpat is is a background waiter
This guy really played us lol.
Man you were completely wrong, just watched it on peacock 😂
Matpat diner scene
Just watched last night !
Does it count as cheating if MAT IS IN THE MOVIE
Spoiler alert!!! . . . . . Near end of the movie, we saw "Golden Freddy" 's spirit turned out to be the blonde boy, not Garret aka Mike's little brother. That killed (also Mike's) Abby's mother, why would someone that's not Garret killed Mike/Abby 's mom if it's not actually her?
Did you know Exactly 28:24 minutes of the movie matpat is there acting as a waiter ina a coffee shop
… how did he guess it word from word
Please make a theory about the amazing digital circus
Only the OG 2014 FNAF fans can like this comment
The reason why golden freddy eyes is blue because he is a pure soul /remnant that transform into an astral animatronic, but the other animatronic is reql animatronic and not manifestation because taht their eyes is red/orange
Fun fact: At the end of the movie there is a distorted robot voice that says: C , O , M , E , F , R , E , M , E , M , E  Which IMO is nearly IDENTICAL to “Come Free Me” so a sequel may be coming and I am excited!   Edit: HEARD IT AGAIN AND IT SAYS “ C , O , M , E , F , I , N , D , M , E (i mixed up N with M, D with E, and I with R SO SORRY)
You made a video about you solved it  Next thing i know. I saw you serving someone in the movie.
Matpat youre not make a theory that is the real story(maybe you just make it unaccurate at first)  of the movie because youre become an easter egg in fnaf movie
Your in the five nights at fedys
I love how matpat was the tabel server in the movie😂😂 that was great to see him in there was well deserved
"I SOLVED THE MOVIE" . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Lad you're literally in it.
Mf's in the movie  and he says his iconic line i love it
I watched the movie and saw mat pat be so persistent on them ordering food
Hey just saying I believe it mentioned in the first game that if your caught they stuff you into a suit and I think that is what the mask machine is
sooooo now that we know MattPatt is in fact an actor in this movie… someone help me understand how this video wasn't scabbing?
Just saw the movie and was soo happy when I saw you at the fast food place 🤯🤯😆😆
Lunch is the best
Only 60😶‍🌫️
Just pointing out the fifth kid a has a striped shirt, just saying
YOU SLY DOG
just saw the movie nd you were not that far off
Imagine that lil kid ruin the whole plot twist because of a instagram comment
If you somehow missed the FNAF phase of YouTube and just the internet in general… you’re too young, get out 😂
Mattpatt knows all this because he was in the movie
I watched it at home but i kinda wish i got to see the theater reactions
MANS IN THE MOVIE
I Just Watch the movie by today and bro almost nailed it😭
Lunch is the most important meal of the day.... its just a theory
Just saw the movie. Very Nice SPOILER:              Nice Cameo Matpat. 👍🏻
I’m watching the movie on peacock at home right now that sparkys scene is the best scene in the movie😂😂😂😂
this is great patrick
Vanessa is william aftons daughter in the movie
Looking back at this after watching the movie he solved the whole movie💀💀
MAT PAT! IM SO PROUD TO SEE YOU IN THE NEW FNAF MOVIE!!!!!!!! I WAS SO OVERWHELEMED WITH JOY NOT ONLY TO SEE MY FAVORITE CHILDHOOD HORROR GAME TURN INTO A MOVIE, BUT ALSO SEE ONE OF MT FAVORITE YOUTUBERS IN IT!!!!! I only have one question, why wasn't Markiplaier in the movie? The King of Fnaf?
now we know why he says I Solved the FNAF Movie because he was in it🤣
buddy your “theory” has been around since the first game came out
BRO WAS IN IT
I’m here just after watching the movie ur clever and deceptive matpat
yooo saw u in the movie
Spoiler warning! I just got back from watching the FNAF movie and how tf did matpat predict all that
MAT PAT YOUR IN THE MOVIE!!!!
What a nice theory, waiter boy 😉
you goofy snoobert, you knew all along
Just watched it, pretty good never seen anything to do w it before and also the whole theatre were like OMG THE FILM THEORY GUY when u come up, very cool👏👏👏
I actually watched the movie and its scary the things he got right
U did well not letting us know we was gonna see you 😂❤
Matpat being in the movie as your typical waiter there is lore here
I just finished watching the movie and matpat literally played us all along❗️HE HAD A CAMEO HIMSELF IN THE DINER LOL
Just watched the movie last night can confirm it’s top tier
Just saw the movie last night & you basically nailed it 😮
BRO IM WATCHING THE FNAF MOVIE AND I SAW YOU IN IT OMG
I'm soooo glad I didnt watch this before seeing the movie
Also what if matpat already knows the full lore but doesnt tell us and just gives us small clues about fnaf
What if vanessa is not the vanessa we see in the security breach but actually her mom or grandmother and the sb vanessa aka vanny is named after her grandma or mom
Congratulations on being in the movie! I was really excited when I saw you at sparkies
MATTHEW U FORGOT TO MENTION YOUR FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE IN THE MOVIEEEEE
(Spoilers) Mike did have a babysitter for Abby but she gets taken out by the animatronics
Anyone else coming here after the movie? Ps that diner scene, best scene.
Crazy to see how right he is with most of these
I cant believe how right matpat was with somethings
I started watching it and I saw you in the movie and I got exited
Bad Movie nice cameo
Matpat was in the Fnaf movie
How’s that job at the diner going?
October 26 actually
Just finished watching the movie. Seeing you in it as a cameo is awesome.
We got played 😭
It was a good movie i loved it
MATT IS A WAITER AT A DINER in the movie or is he but that’s just A THEORY FLIM THOREY!
Dawg you’re in the movie what do you mean you don’t know what happenes
About the cupcake thing look at the kitchespirit kids too and the candle
I watched the movie yesterday and my whole theatre was screaming and cheering when you came on! We love you MatPat!! Loved the Sparky the dog reference too!
I have finally watched Five Nights At Freddy’s Movie and I got a theory.
I'm watching the movie right now, and I can't believe you're in the movie 🤯
I just want to say how awesome it was to see you in the movie!!!!!❤
But vanessa was William's daughter..
Crazy how much he got right 😂
I have just watched the fnaf movie and then watched this video and you have got majority of what you said correct besides the end of the movie and the main plot twist but W movie and W video
SPOILER:  not a remnant extracter but close its the freddy fazbear mask
Still can't believe matpat was the waiter in the fnaf movie 💀
YOU WERE IN IT
Matpat needs a new channel named fnaf theory
Nice cameo
He was in it. LETS GOOOO
Those who know that MatPat is in the FNAF movie
I am the only one that thinks that Scott cawthon is going to make fnaf 2 movie ?
MATPAT YOU WERE SO AMAZING IN THE FNAF MOVIE
Just saw the fnaf movie.! Matpat you’re amazing
I SAW YOU IN THE FNAF MOVIE!!! 😂❤️
When were u going to tell us ;>
after watching the movie, this was almost completely correct. Congrats 😂.
You did great in the movie.
He even says it's a theory!!!! Omg I am so happy I thought it wasn't going to happen :(. I saw it on peacock today the 26th!
He's in the movie!!!!!!
after whatching the movie i am really suprised with how acuret this was other than the baby part although that was close and some other stuff but i dont really want to spoil it but still wow good job mat oh and i love your cameo
This theory is about as believable as MatPat working at a Denny's in his free time 🙄
who's here after the fnaf movie drop
Watching this after seeing the movie is amazing
I love you so much, so so much
I should’ve known NEVER TRUST A MAN!!!!!
You know exactly why you're here.
just watched the movie its pretty good i think but what do i know. also congrats on the part i think you were right about the breakfast thing
Watching this after seeing the movie to see how accurate he was
So who is here after MatPat was shown as a short cameo at the restaurant scene?
sooooo Matt we need to talk, i saw the movie.... i aint spoiling anything cause that would be wrong, but bro.....bro
Got pretty close, not close enough though.
WELCOME TO SPARKY’S!
Matt Patt I saw the movie. I won't spoil anything but just know I know.
i love he always says "we're gonna solve it" and then proceeds to do exactly that
I watched the movie when you came out I started peeing my pants🥹🥹🥹🥹🫵🏼🫵🏼🫵🏼🫵🏼 may I order I milkshake please and so waffles
My guy read the script and got it right
Bro just casually doesn’t mention that he’s in the movie, I’m still sad markiplier wasn’t in it
The fact that he guessed 90% of the movie
Post movie watch the kid with blonde hair is def golden Freddy soooooo rip that theory. But that does leave the question of what ends up happening to garret. Initial thought would be puppet. But it could also be balloon boy as he had a few cheeky jumps at Mike throughout the film and at Cory at the end. Also you getting a “theory” line in the movie was very cool. All in all the movie will be a 10/10 for fans but people shouldn’t expect a horror movie going into it rather a thriller/ drama as it’s really trying to tell a story instead of scaring people. It’s an interesting choice but it’s one I really liked
Ik your secret mat! Don’t think you’re slik I have seen the movie 😂
anyone else wait to watch this till after they saw the movie? or is it just me? 😂
Im so happy mat pat was in the movie
“That’s just a theory”- the best waiter ever… matpat is the lore now 💀
MATPATTTTT I CANT BELIEVE THAT U WERE IN THE FNAF MOVIE OMGGGG
i loved your cameo in it
MATPAT YOURE IN THE NEW FNAF MOVIE ?!?!?!?! I JUST WATCHED IT THAT WAS INSANE
After watching the movie, I was so happy to see MatPat make a cameo! He’s come so far! Love y’all!
Spoiler alert             Funny that Mat Pat went over all this when he literally had a cameo in the movie and and even threw in a "that's just a theory"
I GOT A AD FOR THE FNAF MOVIE WHILE WATCHING THIS
Watched the. Obie he got like half of it right
AAHHHHHH YOU’RE IN IT YOU SLY DOG, YOU’RE IN THE MOVIE!!!!!
Oh you solved it mat pat I know your secret we’ll find out tomorrow 👀👀
FNAF movie review *spoiler free* 9/10 - exactly what I hoped and expected it to be, thrilling and creepy, while mysterious and twisty.  Only a few minor gripes, all of which didn’t affect the story or my enjoyment of it.   The only real complaint is that a bunch of kids in the theater wouldn't shut up and talked through the whole thing. 🙄
But your in it 😂 quit pretending your not 😂
No wonder his theory is so accurate, he’s literally in the script.😂
sorry about the happy ending matpat
dude litterallyhadthe script
Oh I just love it when these theories don't age well. C'mon. You were IN this  and still didn't get this right.
Care to explain yourself? Lol
just saw the movie and w h a t h o w
I just Saw the movie Button
FNAF TAKES PLACE IN UTAH!?!? IS FREDDY A MORMON?
I just finished the movie and since you were in it let me see if this theory is similar to the movie because if so I have a theory of my own
After seeing the movie I bet garret is the puppet or balloon boy
Like if you’re here from seeing MatPat in the movie 🤯🤩🤩
Thats funny im watching it tomorrow
Just saw you in the FNAF movie, congratulations 🍾
You pumpkin eater you're in the movie
YOU  WERE IN THE MOVIE YOU LIAR Also can’t wait for them to see the credits
Very interestingly backwards plot ideas, good job getting it's definitely interesting to see.   Also loved you in the diner
Matt is in the movie!!!!
I just watched the movie and how correct and incorrect where also nice cameo
just watched the movie, this was very accurate good job!
HES IN THE MOVIE‼️‼️
spoiler!!!     i really would've liked that garret would've been golden freddy, it seems way more spot on
So did Mat get all of this right because he was in the movie or is he seriously that good?   (Edit: “i have made a severe and continuous laps in my judgement”)
Hesssssss in itttffgtt
I have to be the first person to just watch the movie in your in it as a waiter my mind is blown
And didn’t even include any information about the aunt from the diner. Tsk tsk
MATPAT is in the fnaf movie!!!!!
Your a waiter😂😂😂😂 I mean Corey’s a taxi driver but darn 😢 and Vanessa as aftons daughter!
You’re in the moviiieeee!1!!!!! Omg congrats!
Mat you got the biggest applause in the whole movie
YOU WERE IN IT
I JS WATCHED IT YOUR I. IT
Bro, you’re literally in the movie you already know how the movie goes😂😂😂😂😂
The ending was nearly spot on!
Matpat You lied to us... OFAFVEMIN Unscramble for spoiler
CAMEO SUCCESS, caught me by surprise. I think there were a lot of things that may pat was not expecting at all, but might make sense when looking at the books again. Interesting family layouts.
Incredible how much you got right also really cool you got a scene too 👍
Whos here after the movie?
Got to say, you got us 😂 i really believed you didnt get a cameo, IT WAS AWESOME SEEING YOU AND Cory in the movie. I wish Mark had time to be in it but he was too busy with Iron Lung😢
Who else came back after the movie to check this, I personally didn’t even watch it till after I just saw the movie.
i think the cupcake is chicas dog. like it acted like a dog, susie lost a dog as we know in pizzeria simulator, it all adds up.
You are in the movie.
The movie came out on peacock on the 26th not the 27th. (Im writing this on the 27th)
HES IN THE MOVIE
Just wish it could’ve been better.
They at least have a good reason it couldn’t have been as good as expected.
The biggest issue was the lack of horror and the fact on how quickly they removed all the tension. Tbh it was a little more goofy. Also it would’ve been a bit nicer if the William afton death thing was like where he like panicking on the ground or something but y’know. I understand it having to be way off the usual fnaf thing. Like it’s hard to make fnaf good for fans and non fans.
YOU ARE A LIAR! YOU ARE IN FNAF MOVIE. (glad u didn’t spoil it)💀
I just saw the five nights at Freddy’s movie and you’re in it everybody in my theater was cheering once you hit the screen
Tbh the movie was not very good. Sure it was fun and stuff but definitely not scary or horror like. And it had like no aspects from the games nor the lore. Sadly.
The “just a theory” cameo in the film you had was amazing! 😂 was not expecting to see MatPat on the big screen! 🙌🏻
Is funny how he actually got some things right
Your in the movie???? Holy Moly!!!!
But... What matt forgot was the fact there's a unnamed female villain. What her role going to be? Is she vanny? Mrs.afton? Maybe mrs.afton helping her husband?
Watching thos after seeing the movie🫣
I just got done watching a movie on Peacock five nights at Freddy’s. It’s been It’s been a Long Time coming by this movie was worth the wait. I loved it. I can’t wait for the sequels now my question is we know the full timeline of the families at Freddy’s so do the movie pretty much have his own storyline it is on Tom. I also it was happy to see the OG game theory make his cameo in the five nights at Freddy’s universe. I would love for every single YouTuber over the years has brought the content and the theories and the timeline videos have the stuff dedicated to five nights at Freddy’s. I’ll make cameos in the future of video games, and also more movies, and be a part of the universe in the timeline.
I like your version of the movie better. I just watched it and think your flow would be nicer.
Good job matpat you got in to the movie
I saw the FNaF movie on the 26th and MatPat, you my friend made an appearance. Did you know all along?
Yo Matt you never said you were in FNAF just how sweet it would be for you to be in it
From Australia🇦🇺 here! The FNAF movie came out on the 26th of October (yesterday now) and I saw it with my sister last night. You did a brilliant job deciphering the movie, MatPat.  ‼️FNAF MOVIE SPOILERS‼️         My favourite character is definitely YOU, MatPat. I I kid you not, the entire cinema cheered when we saw you, and then you said the famous word “theory” and everyone cheered again! It was amazing and I am SO PROUD of you🎉—you absolutely deserved that cameo, I wish I could give you a hug!! At the very end of the movie credits, there’s this crackly, static-y voice that spells something out. Everyone left in the cinema went quiet, and when someone asked if anyone knew what it said, someone else called out that we’d just have to wait for a theory from MatPat! You definitely had some fans of yours in that cinema, me and sister included! Keep up the awesome work, I love all of your theories!❤
MATT YOU SNEAKY LITTLE THING. you had me so sad thinking you werent in the movie!!! i legit screamed "MATPAT!!?" when i saw you!! so happy for you
Nebraska is a location of a fan made game where foxy gets thrown off a cliff
This aged really well
Hi ness
Is it distilling or is it telling the story from a different perspective? Like what if the different timelines and canons are different perspectives of events that actually happened? Like it would cover most of the plot holes. Its kind of out there and Its definitely one of those "but it was all a dream" theories but it might lead into an even more extended storyline and would make a lot of sense
SPOILER               NO WONDER MATPAT FIGURED IT OUT HES IN THE MOVIE
You were correct on most of it
So about that happy ending...
HOW DID YOU KNOW. HOW DID U KNOWWWWWWWWWWW
Matpat I just saw the fnaf movie, me and my friend were so excited when we saw you say it’s just a theory!!!!! 🤩
MattPatt you sly boy, I saw you in the movie!!
SPOILERS AHEAD           BRO, Spoilers. If you complain, why did you scroll all the way down         When I saw MatPat in the movie, I almost screamed “OH SH*T!!”
MATPAT YOUR IN THE MOVIE YOU SAY UOU LINE GJJQNAJANSMSNSMSMSKWKWKW you always knew didn’t you
He played us like a fiddle guys.
MATPAT CONFIRMED IN FNAF. Such a good cameo ❤❤❤
I do think however that the fifth child is golden Freddy because of the fact that he is wearing a striped shirt, I'm sure he noticed just failed to mention it BUT HEY THAT'S JUST A THEORY
I just watched the FNAF movie, and for the most part, Matpat had it right. SPOILERS AHEAD!! The fifth child does possess the cupcake, and Abby does defeat William by winning over the animatronics, though she doesn't fall into a circus baby suit. Chica tried to put her in the suit, but fails because Mike taxed her and the other animatronics, and they also don't put William behind a wall, they lock him in a room, where there is no camera. And William was the one who kidnapped Garrett. The movie didn't tell us if Garrett pisses Golden Freddy yet, but it does tell us that William killed him. And the people that broke in were trying to get Mike fired because Mike's Aunt Jane wanted custody of Abby.
My kids and I flipped at the diner scene... they jumped out of their seats and basically screamed... pleasantly surprised, and the Easter egg and cameo we were most excited by
*MOVIE SPOILERS*    It’s funny that not only was he right about some of this but he was in the movie
Just watched the movie and love the cameos in it
MatPat, I just got back from the movie. When you showed up, everyone began to cheer LOUDLY. We quieted down in time to hear you say “it’s just a theory,” and the cheering began again. I have zero clue what you said, but we were all so excited to see you on screen.   Congratulations, MatPat! Your presence made a room full of nerds cheer!
Oh my god you were right william killed his brothrr and hired him to finish the family off
So happy 2cu in the movie
matpat knows this because he's in the fnaf movie, he's read the script, this isn't theorizing!
Matpat  You WERE IN THE FNAF MOVIE???  AS A WAITER?
''Come find me''
We’ll considering you were on set it makes sense how you got some part’s right.
I know this was made 1 month ago but dang MatPat really hid the fact he is in the Fnrf movie good
I'M A KID AND YOU WHERE IN THE FIVE NIGHTS MOVIE I SAW IT JUST WATCH THE MOVIE YOU SAID YOUR MOST CLASSIC AND ORIGINAL LINE IT'S JUST A THEORY
Most important meal
matt….. you were SLICK.
MatPat was in the movie!! And he said his line!!
bro is in the movie!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations on your new job as a diner waiter *wink*.
I honestly screamed when I saw you were in a movie, and the fact you said 'it's just a theory" made the cameo x1000 better.
Golden freddy be the fifth child 💀
You lied about not being in the movie Mat. It’s backshot time.
I DONT WANNA SPOIL BUT I JUST SAW THE MOVIE AHD HES IN IT
OF COURSE you solved it after BEING in it. Lol congrat mat pat
You are in the movie! How do you not know the plot lol
I loved this movie
This movie was a gift
Should I say something about the movie literally no one expected?
I did what it like this if you have
Who else is here again after seeing the movie?😂
Anyone else watching this after seeing him in the movie?
SPOILERS. LIKE SERIOUSLY ACTUAL SPOILERS.        Just finished the fnaf movie. Was fun but it wasn’t exactly like what you’d think the movie would be like. I’m not going to spoil certain things but it definitely didn’t take the survive factor of the five nights. But it was still a funny and fun movie to watch. There was a goofy death scene but otherwise still pretty good. Matpat was wrong about there not being a happy ending.
I have a theory and I don’t know a better place than to put it here. I am thinking the second movie is a dream with Mike, aka fnaf 4. If you watched the movie, you know that the speaker went off, then everything started going on, and he turns it off and on, then there is nothing, the speaker and makes a little noise like static, and that makes me think that maybe it’s a sound illusion disk? Also he is literally moving in his dream and walking around and talking to people IN HIS DREAM.
I just watched FNAF. Mat pat you sly dawg
Bro works in a fast food diner and say it's a theory a food then someone tells him to shut up
MAT WAS IN THE MOVIE 🤯
So you’re telling me it’s a plot twist interesting
Is anyone else back after seeing the movie??
Turns out I didn't need to watch the movie, cuz Matt literally, already saw it
I SAW IT  ON PEACOCK
It must have been hard to hop skip and jump your way around your NDA for this movie
Congrats on the movie Mat
Yo he is in the film!
Matpat was in the movie
MATPAT EXPLAIN YOURSELF, WHERE'S THE LIVE EPISODE??
Sounds like someone’s theory wasn’t proven right, again.
Makes sense
I just watched the movie and you were in it, that was so hilarious what you said
MatPat is the only person who I want to spoil movies for me  And I agree lunch is the most important meal of the day
I’ve seen you somewhere…
Youre in the movie
I saw you in the movie
Just got home from the movie, HMMMMMMM
You lied. I watch the movie
This is so funny watching this after seeing the film
I seen the five nights at Freddy’s movie and I heard Matpat Voice in the movie
Coming back to this video "solving this franchise" hits a little different
also, the striped shirt… could that be the security puppet?
Hey Matpat I saw the fnaf movie congrats…
sirrrrr i saw u in the film and could not stop laughing
What if maybe it’s mikes half brother that he grew up with but had a different father maybe and that’s how maybe mike doesn’t know who’s running the place and doesn’t know about fnaf
YOU WERE IN THE MOVIE
Just saw you in the movie! "Its just a theory" 👀
he’s in the movie as a little cameo
Mapatt your in 5he movie
Matpat, i saw the movie......i know
He solved it cause he's in it (I just got back from the movie, i got so excited seeing your appearance in movie)
Did I just see Matt pat in Cinematic Debut what .Right on Matt pat
HE IS IN THE MOVIE I WATCHED IT LIKE AN HOUR AGO
Waiter matpat is cannon now!!!!!
SPOILERS FOR THE FNAF MOVIE          MATPAT CAMEOD IN THE MOVIE LETS GO BOIS
YOU ARE A LIAR MATPAD!!!!! LIAR 😂😂😂
Spoiler            He is in the movie
Watching this on peacock on Thursday,  October 26th, 2023, and just found out mat pat actually makes a appearance in the film?!?! Crazy man
Lets gooo home state
Well no wonder he knew about what the plot would be about
On the right track. Some events are in wrong order. Surprisingly close to the movie
Bro just got it spot on I’m shocked 😮
Was this made before or after filming his cameo? 🤨🤨
i saw you in the movie👀
Mat pat i swear to god you- im so mad at you rn-
Matpat needs to be in this movie
LETS GOOO MATPAT CAMEO IN THE MOVIE
I just watched the movie
HE WAS CORRECT I JUST WATCHED IT THIS MANS A LEGEND
I ALMOST STARTED CRYING WHEN I SAW YOU IN THE MOVIE!
Well no duh you know, you’re in own!
You were in the movie!!!!!!!
Watched the movie today NO SPOILERS but very good
MattPat literally predicted the ending that just leaked yesterday.
NAHHH CUZ MATPAT BEING THE WAITRESS WAS. 🫣🫢😧
Matt pat. Didn’t you star  on the movie? Aren’t you the guy from Sparkys?
Matpat cameo in the actual film was great!!
Did you make this before or after your cameo hmmm 🤔🤔
this is so interesting to watch after seeing the movie
EVERYONE IN MY THEATER WAS SO SHOCKED TO SEE YOU IN THE MOVIE
Mat, I love you but you cant do this episode. YOU'RE IN THE FILM!
when you said the kid that didnt have any characteristics to the animatronics and said he might be the cupcake, but look at his shirt, its striped and he wears blue jeans, could he be the crying child????
After watching the movie and coming back to this Mat Pat was pretty spot on and THE FACT HE WAS IN IT TOO man is just gonna brush that off. Anyway absolute legend
I think Abby is supposed to be Elizabeth
Already out in the Netherlands, the theory is pretty accurate
Came to comment that everyone went mental when you showed up in the movie in The Netherlands as well. Thank you for bringing the franchise where it is today together with the other creators!
IT COMES OUT TOMORROW !!!!!!
MATT was right bro he’s gotta be hacking
I cant explain how many people screamed in the cinema in Bosnia and Herzegovina when you appeared. It's insane that you left a huge mark on a generation not only in English speaking nations, but in general in the world as well... Thank you Mat for everything
Hey.  He got a cameo in the movie!!
Just realized Matt and the team has been studying story telling for so long they could probably write their own cuz they understand the plot pattern
Perhaps the fnaf movie is what the games are based off of
Evidence there will be NO franchise with this. Hopefully. So they put together parts from the whole series for 1 cohesive story in 1 films run time. "HOllywood".. My dude Mathew would be great at being a "nice man"  to turn psychotic child killer.
i'd much rather see a theory about that waiter in the movie... he seemed strangely familiar...
Who else came from the cinema and straight to this
Bro knew the whole plot from before 😂
I arleady saw it Awsome I expected more but its ok
I have two comments First off, we do see an animatronic with built in saws, or at least teeth, with Elizabeth in the Fourth Closet. We see that when Carlton goes to find Charlie's "experiment" and fake Charlie (aka Elizabeth) "flirts" with and captures Carlton. Second, I honestly thought that Golden Freddy would be Mike. It would make sense with the game lore, judging by the fact that it was originally theorized that there were TWO souls in Golden Freddy. And hey, maybe that means Mike has finally reunited with his long lost brother. Actually there is a third thing. If the theory of the animatronics being hostile towards Abby is true, then the movie has definetly deviated from the book trilogy, because in the Silver Eyes Golden Freddy, aka the original Micheal shows up and the animatronics start to trust the gang.
I can’t believe you were in it and didn’t tell us !!!!
Dear Matpat Im from germany and today i saw the fnaf movie on his primere. I need a theorie because im more confused than before. I hope so hard you can tie my lose ends to this film and you can tell me what is canon and what not. I wont spoiler you but i hope ypu can understand me after you saw the movie❤
tomorrow...
Loved Matpatts cameo
Hey Matt Pat, just got back from the movie. LOVED your cameo! you deserved to be in it with all the work you put into the franchise :)
|||||SPOILERS|||||   MATPAT HOW COILD YOU???? HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO US NOT TELL US HOW COULD YOU?!?!?!?!!!?!
Matpat did a great acting job
YOU LITTLE BAST*** YOU KNEW ALL ALONG YOU SPOILED THE MOVIEEEEEEEEE
Congrats on being in the movie
Matpat has a scene in the Fnaf movie. Congrats ps came out in Britain on 25th
Spoilers for the movie (it came out in Germany today)   Matthew Robert Patrick...   I almost screamed when I saw you.   I want you to know how much willpower it took not to do that.   And omg they did you dirty in German dub
i watched it 2 days before you americans got to, i love austria for showing the movie on the 25th Edit: bevore anyone asks, no there wasnt a single person who screamed remnant, the living thombstone played in the credits and there is an audio somewhere at the credits but no real post credit szene
Mat pat I didn’t know you worked at a restaurant😂
Spoiler ahead:      So he was right about some parts and was in the move like Zoinks scoob i just killed 5 children.
Pov: matpat was in the movie. Tricked us (uk person who watch early)
YOU'RE IN THE MOVIE?? Omg congratulations
Bro predicted the entire movie
I have that Freddy costume 😭
NAH HE TRICKED US ALL, HE WAS IN THE FNAF  MOVIE. A real actor indeed
I'm glad I watched this AFTER I've seen the movie. This man spoiled almost everything. ... the movie has balloon boy jumpscares...
Im seeing the movie tomorrow!
Would’ve been cool
mat pat jumpscare got me like
A surprising amount of this is actually really close, going off a couple scenes.
i think that the boy that u called "the cupcake spirit" is golden freddy because of his clothing is apparently closer to the crying child clothes
I know I’m like so late but Vanessa is Afton’s daughter, which is twisting my whole brain rn
Just finished the movie The fact he was kinda right is insane
4.5/8 right. pretty good this time matpat
Bro you already knew the story you acted in the movie
who else came here from just having watched the movie?
Matpat got almost everything figured out. His mind is a mistery
as someone whose seen it you got a LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT of things wrong a few if not 1 thing right
I watched the movie because it came out early here and Vanessa says William is her dad,,LIKE WHAT?!
If none of this makes sense you need to dive back into over 100 videos over 10 years. ❤❤
Oh I can't wait until tomorrow to watch this after people in the states have seen it, all the theories are going to be juciy 😏
spoiler: mat pat cameo
It's shockingly amazing how matt nearly completely nailed it on how the movie will be like before the movie came out compare with the movie itself.（ spoiled alerts in comment section 🚨 for those who haven't saw the movie yet)
omg its the waiter from the movie XD
Can't believe he was actually in the film 😂👍
I was JAW dropped when I saw u as the waiter in the dinner u were great!
Loved the cameo mate, loved the movie, hope we see you in future installations
I got to see the movie, UK release and all.   Nice to see you ;)
YOU ARE IN THE FNAF MOVIE !!!
give me 2 more months
Bro solving a movie that didn’t come out and sponsoring it with Google Meet 💀💀     Edit: How so it’s cause you acting in it 😂
YOU LIEEEEDDDD
It isnt even canon. No way
Bro the movie is not out yet
Together we are fnaf🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
I just watched the film! It was awesome!!! A lot of mixed reviews in the cinema. But I loved it, my sister isn’t really a fan of the game soo getting to whisper and explain the cool little Easter eggs in the film was incredible 😭😭 and the CAMEO!!!? I cackled 🤣
MATPAT I JUST SAW U IN THE FNAF MOVIE I NEED ANSWERS
don't you think the "cupcake kid's" clothes are exactly like the crying kid's?
My name is Garrett
No no I want to go into this movie naive as fu k
watched it and some are correct some are wrong diff time zones so i got early access
you sneeky sneeky man, i saw what you did, where is my coffee
Matpat must watch fnaf movie
The movie wasnt even out bro 😭 🙏
Bruhh i just watch it today it is  brilliant  👏 😅
This is bleeming hilarious to watch after the release of movie and having watched it in theaters.
Wait but isn’t golden Freddy possessed by 2 spirits, i have a theory that either that cupcake child is in there too or the twist is that abby is put in at the end and it sends mike into that rage that forces him to pursue William and put the animatronics to rest (🔥)
watched the movie last night, congrats on the cameo!!!
HOLY LUCIFER @MATPAT!!! BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL WORSE THAN DEADPOOL YOU ARE IN THE FNAF MOVIE!!!!!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯 Now you belong to Scott. Now FNAF is REAL.  William Afton will be YOUR best worst nightmare FOREVER 😂😂😂
Matpat you liar. (I’ve seen the movie)
I saw MatPat in the movie
HE WAS IN THE MOVIE
Lunch really is the most important meal of the day
Don’t worry it’s just a theory
watched the movie last night, fun to rewatch this back
broski was so wrong about the movie, jeez
Please make a video about the movie lore It's disgusting...
If Golden Freddy doesn’t appear in a meaningful way, maybe just as a costume on the ground, I think a fun detail for the credits would be if you brighten up the image of the credits and be able to see Golden Freddy, eyes glowing with life but still slumped over
Yeah i watched the movie gotta say the end is not as cool as I hoped but I still loved it
This man was in the film and wasnt told the story😂😂
Guys I've just watched this movie, I was overjoyed when i saw him in this movie (but don't expect anything too special😂)
of course matpat knows the plot of the movie 🤨
Did everyone forget the aftons a British
Not me watching this after I’ve seen the movie so I can see how much Matpat got right
Close enough Also pretty accurate at times
Love ur cameo in the movie mat ❤️
this is scarily accurate
I saw the movie yesterday and threw out the movie some of my theories while I was watching came true, but one thing stood out for me what happen to Michel's brother did he became an animatronic or did Afton didn't bother turning him into one, because my theory is that he is either balloon boy or and animatronic in a future film, because in the fnaf lore balloon boy is also possessed and it could make sense of how he keeps popping up in some scenes. but that's just a theory a film theory!
why would afton kidnap garett/evan tho
Well if anyone could prodicked it it’s u u were on set
Loved your cameo
I already saw the movie and there was  a really great cameo that I didn’t expected at all. I screamed and cried a little. Unfortunately, it was in Mexico, so almost no one new who this guy was and why his cameo was sooooo good😩 The secret animatronic was great too! Also I didn’t expected that one hahahaha
I just watched the movie and i know what youre doing lol
MATPAT I JUST WATCHED THE MOVIE FROM AUSTRALIA - YOU LIED
After watching the movie, he was correct
He is in the movie guys he is a waiter sooo coool
YOU WERE SO GOOD IN THE MOVIE BRO
hey matpat i saw you in fnaf movie in the restouran scene lol
Just came back from watching the movie, and thanks to you I saw the plot twist a mile ahead, and also *spoilers*         It was amazing to see you in the movie ❤
I just realised the movie is coming out tomorrow (in pacific time)
never cook again
I GOT A FNAF TRAILER AD WHILE WATCHING THIS😭😭😭😭😭
Because I think fnaf is not mean't to be futuristic
I don't like security breach and dlc
THEY SPRUNG THE TRAP!!
This movie is si great, it confirms so many misteries and theories .
jsut got back from the movie and it is crazy good, but theres so much there and so much stuff to dive into
U HELPED ME FIGURE THE MOVIE OUT BC I WAS SO CONFUSED BUT EVERYTHING U SAID MAKES SO MUCH SENSE
I just watched the movie and he’s a waiter in the movie
*Spoilers* Just came from the movie... you discovered like 80% of the movie based of the trailer. I'm amazed
NO WAY I FEEL SO BETRAYED
Damm you move quickly
The fitht child might be the pupet
PLAY PALS AT 1:16  TEAM NICE DYNAMITE??!?!?!?!?!??!??  Brings back memories
I think that the 5th kid is one of the souls in golden Freddy cause rember he has 2 and I thinks it’s him in rather garret or Abby will die and become the second soul
I think that Vanessa is Cassidy’s sister. Maybe that’s why she knows so much of what happened and that’s why she became a cop.
YOOOOOO
Some people say breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  But it’s just a theory huh?
Watched it (im Australian lol), so im watching it to see the accuracy 😩 Spoiler:      My friends and i screamed when you said your line omg
i would love to see a security breach movie
Wow I’m speechless
Omg I got a trailer for the movie before watching the video XD
U little liar, your in the Fnaf movie
Imma watch this movie soon since it comes out in two days imma see how accurate this is
Best not be no spoilers in the comments, cause im rewatching this the night before I see the movie
Imagine your theory becoming the movie.  Yeah he basically got the gist of the end right.
Plot twist: Matpat is in the movie and was told the whole plot and spoiled the movie!
Me coming back now it’s out to see how close he was
15:00 what about the crying child in the fredbear suit
3:02 RIP l chipo 😢
LUNCH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY FOLKS 😅😅😅😅🎉🎉❤❤ love you bro love the work you have done over all these years and i hope you see it as a pay off
GUESS WHO SAID THEY WERENT GOING TO BE IN THE MOVIE AND ENDED UP BEING IN THE MOVIE, RIGHT WAITER?  The whole british cinema started screaming when they saw u on screen, we love u here mat
You know that this theory was actually quite a good one (as most of your theories are). It fits quite nicely with the film, I just watched it today so can say if your right or wrong but I won't spoil it for anyone. I loved your part of the film aswell, that was cool :)
Matpat! Ive just seen the film and dont want to say or give away anything...  But... that being said..   I know, that you know, that you know that I know, what it is Im talking about. And good job 😅😆👍
I don't wanna spoil it but, it was extremely accurate
matpat figured out a film that he was in
Wait so mat you were in the movie… was this video a hoax????
I just watched the movie today and its actually crazy how you accurately pinpoint important details and turns out you're RIGHT.
MATPAT WAS IN THE MOVIE OMDS THE WAY I SCREAMED SO LOUD WHEN HE CAME ON AS A DINER WAITER 😭😭😭😭😭 star of the movie fr 😊
Ngl I waited until I watched the movie before seeing this video, just in case MatPat somehow got it right and spoiled it 😭
somewhat correct
no spoilers, but you're going to recognize ine actor in the movie, even though he isnt one
How do you sleep?
SPOILER          Thank you for the cameo ❤️
incredible performance even for a quick scene.
I've been fooled by this man already because he was a part of it the whole time !!!!  It's just a theory (Seeing him in the film brought me so much joy)
i love how alot of this was well thought out, watching this after watching the movie (SPOILER) great scene you were in had me excited to see you
MattPatt you Son of a Gun. The Movie was AWSOME, especially the little SUPRISE in the Movie!
It's almost here
the remnant extractor is for sutufing ppl i think
bro you were in the fnaf movie
i’m only just over halfway through, but after seeing a recent trailer where vanessa says she used to live this place when she was a kid, i have a whack job theory that the girl in chica is somehow her sister. there’s literally 0 connections outside of hair color, don’t ask me for more. i just for no reason have a Feeling™️  immediate edit: to be FAIR, why else would she be so interested, yk? i can just see it, her sister goes missing and she vows to find out what happened to her. becomes an officer, learns some of the truth, but still doesn’t know who did it or how it happened, and we whet her knockin on the door!  second edit: i’m HOPING it’s still that mikes little brother is in fredbear and that’s why him and abby get along so well, they’re siblings!  third: mans immediately said this i feel like a fool,
The staff definitely watched some of game theory videos for the movie
I just watched the fnaf movie today!!!
The fact i got a five nights at freddys ad before this
genuinely got heart pain when mat pat appeared on the screen in the cinema and said ‘that’s just a theory’
He was right!!!
I can’t believe your in the fnaf movie 🎉
Ive literally come to this video sinve ive just seen the movie, Matpat got a lot of things right and helped me realise something using this info about things that happen in the movie.
Loved seeing you. Waiter
Just saw the film nice acting dude 👏
15:30 the other kid is probably the second soul for golden Freddy, do u guys not remember the theory that there is 2 souls in him?
SPOILER WARNING               Matpat try solve why Scott or Blumhouse made it so vanessa is Williams child and not mike
Well well
I think the twist is that the one im Afftons suite is Michaels brother and hes still alive just doing what he was taught by affton at a young age
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day 😉
Please don't make it like this friendship makes the dream work story
you're literally in it XD
MATT YOUR IN IT WHATTTT
Matpat cameo's uncalled for, "it's just a theory"
MATPAT CONGRATS FOR BEING IN THE FNAF MOVIE YOU SLAYED
BRO YOU'RE IN THE MOVIE
I'm gonna go ahead and not watch as to not spoil the movie incase you are correct
I saw it on the first viewing this morning it was pretty good even my friend who has never played the games enjoyed it
I saw it today and it was really good
Just seen the movie and it was great, Scott did good.
Wait does anyone know what rating for this movie
Wait does anyone know what rating for this movie
15:05  right okay. That child’s outfit is really similar to the crying child’s — who got killed by Fred ear, who looks like golden freddy. I think that that might show that CC is the one in control of golden Freddy Or sm like that
honestly i've never played the games but foxy is my favorite i even had a dream foxy was my friend. but yeah if freddy's pizzeria was real you would need freddy and foxy to stay put
Ngl this is going to be the first horror movie i’’ve ever want to watch or franchise because it was confirnwd that the 2nd movie will be based on the 2nd game as i heard
Cassie sounds like Cassidy😮😮😮😮😮😮
FNAF NEEDS A CLOTHING LINE!!
He has four channels and all he does is yap
So he’s not Mike..Afton 😔
Come Find Me, we could have some breakfast, after all they say it's the most important meal of the day, but that's just a Theory, or we could just grab a few slices and watch the story unfold, are you ready for Freddy?
I saw a early preview of this movie because my friends dad does movies and it’s very gory and we see Michael getting scooped and the bite of 83 and the spring lock failure as well and cassidy gets stabbed 7 times in the face and you see someone getting chopped up and you can see a decade body in the suit
Bros reading the films script.
nobody has nebraska in their goals
I live in Nebraska but he will not have freedom from the corn fields there are way to many corn fields
The 5th kid is Balloon boy, soundtrack confirmed him in the movie
Crazy
the movie didn’t even com out yet 💀
are you serious right now bro.? T-T
Bro did you see CoryxKenshin bro
Just because he's sitting at Steve Raglans desk, doesn't mean he's Steve Raglan. Wouldn't be surprised if he killed him and took his place to lead Mike to Freddy's.
OMG DO A THEORY ON THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUSSSS
The fifth kid might be "the one you should not have killed "
The Cupcake is just a cursed object full of Agony, not possessed like the animatronics. At least, that's just MY Theory.
the fifth kid is dressed like crying child…
REMNANT!!!
I think the 5th child it is puppet. Because he is dressed like him.
it is the most likely that that fifth child is Charlotte, or at least the movies version of Charlotte, as the stripes are similar to the puppets.
I think the movie is different than the first game because: we know that Help Wanted is a game made by Fnaf Co when the pizzaplex oppened to make think that all these crimes didn't existed and that actual people want to go to the pizzaplex. What If Fnaf 1 is like Help wanted and the events in the game aren't what really appened, and the movie is what really happened.
Golden Freddy is possessed by Cassidy which is a girls name and you can assume that because of her voice lines
Fnaf just owns Matt’s life at this point
I called the cupcake! No seriously it had red eyes too man.
BRO The cupcake looking like the crying child? Hmmmmmmm
I also learned that the movie will be coming out this Friday which all of us know,BUT IT WILL BE IN THEATERS AND APPARENTLY STREAMING ON PEACOCK! (Please raise your hand on the comments if you will be searching for lore just to come back and comment about it on this video 😂 🖐️!)
He did it…., HE FINALLY DID IT! YES👏👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉
I have a theory about this man's theory's, what if Scott cothen makes matpats theory's cannon because he can't figure out his own games lore
Now that I think about it. Imagining getting a Undertale or Doki literature movie
I’m sorry man I wish Scott invited u you carried
Nah I think Susie’s dog is the one possessing cupcake/carl from the way he mauls that one guys face off exactly like a dog EDIT: Evan posseses shadow Freddy btw so I don’t think Cassidy snd Evan share souls in golden Freddy. (no hate)
Matpat cmom the kid has a striped shirt its clearly representing golden freddy
Mike is golden Freddy at the end
65 2:24
What is REMNANT (this a joke don't answer it)
15:21 MatPat: This kid has no identifying factor connecting him to any other animatronic, including Golden Freddy The Kid’s Golden Blonde Hair: Am I a joke to you?
The fifth child is the crying child!! The shirt is striped!!!ll
Maybe Cassie is Gregory sister? She has same flowers as in that flower portrait in the minigame
The mask part reminds me of Roxy newer mask in dlc. Now we don’t see what’s behind it or before it has fur on it and stuff but just the sockets look similar.
Together we are FNAF🗣️🗣️🔥🔥
WAIT WAIT WAIT, WOULDN'T THAT MEAN THAT ABBY IS BASICALLY ELIZIBETH?!?!
REMNANT, and why did it take 8 years?!!!!!!? I love and hate the anticipation
The child actor in the comments used the devil emoji, which is.... purple
together we are the fnaf
Bro the movie hasn’t even come out yet😭
I reckon, abby will die. and becomes Marionette. in the next movie.
Or did you...
Bro spoiled the movie before he even watched it
I think Vanessa might eventually betray Mike and Abby
he foreshadowed the new merch at the begging
Mann don't spoil this movieh
so random but is it even legally possible to keep a place where a business used to be, still there and unoccupied even if the the company went out of business? who funds that? who allows that? i should proably know cause i do business studies but i donttt haha
He has striped shirt so maybe…
“our favourite bunny themed serial killer” what a time to be alive
the blade thing from the movie trailer kinda looks like the scoop from ruin dlc with blades 🤷‍♀
Bro is so popular google meet asked him to promote them.
The “cupcake kid” has a stripped shirt, look into that…
Ummm aren’t you worried bringing attention to that young actors comment might risk him potentially getting sued for breaking NDA?
Im telling y'all, this is truly going to reveal the lore behind Golden Freddy and how spring trap got his first death! The crying child is golden Freddy, abby is baby, and the security guard is of course Michael in a way. The story line may not be exact and line up with the video games, but no story of Scott's adds up with each other; for an example the books. They are just there to point out clues so we can get the real story of the games.
@MatPat - The boy with the stripey jumper could be the crying child most likely around 10-12 yrs old.
Bro just exposed the whole movie before we even get to watch a full 5 minutes of the movie😭
That machine is in the secret ending of sb dlc 2:48
Before I got to watch this an ad popped up and I was a trailer for the movie😶
Scott's last words -"tell matpat, tell him he was wrong"
So I got the fbaf trailer ad right before this video started thats weird
I SURVIVED THE MOST LETHAL INJECTION!!! ITS CALLED FNAF LORE IN ONE SECOND
Bruh Scott is lazy AF. It should not be this difficult making a movie. They could have literally focus on William Afton and Henry. They build the animatronics! It's barley the first movie! They don't have to rush in and start killing. Smh
5:41 Be careful what you wish for.
what isn’t ‘steve’ supposed to be his father ugh what
the boy in brown is freddy the one in yellow with the top hat, that they went out of their way to obscure a little in the trailer is golden freddy.
I think that Williams suit will get messed up throughout the movies
Hello internet welcome to film theory!
I got a fnaf movie Ad when I clicked on thos
he's spending three hours a day on google's meat
When Matpat showed the FNAF Freddy costume and said “Oh my sweet stars, what have I done?” I instantly broke into laughter
My nephew told me about the movie I knew my boy would be all over it had to search. Intro so funny bro
I thought the blonde boy with the stripped shirt in the scene where the children standing in the forest could be the puppet
2:43 could be a mask like it says in fnaf 1 they have wires and all that in like the first night
Both the boy (cupcake) and crying child both wear striped shirts
Shout out my great state of Nebraska!!!!
I live in Nebraska that crazy?!?
Am I crazy or does the fifth child have a striped shirt like crying child. Is that not an identifiable feature?
okay, so @GTLive I support you're theory, but. I think the 5th kid is not who you think, think about it the stripes? PUPPET! since somebody (I think you Idk) figured out that puppet was supposed to be a guy even though they have a female voice. so Idk maybe you're right I'm wrong or I'm right and you're wrong only time/the future can tell.
Waittt a minute….. We HAVE seen the device in the trailer! Remember count the ways! That’s the thing that decapitated Millie!
Utah to Nebraska colorado is just sitting there right in the middle
What if the child who might be the cupcake is the crying child? Because the outfit is sort of similar to the outfit of the crying child?
5:13 Or maybe that’s where he’s from.
Interesting choice, Hollywood.
bro I lime in colorado so i am poopin' my pants I WANNA MOVE TO FLORIDA
little cupcake
image that you are chica and then you just launch your  hand out to scare them
one drawing looks like a gooba under a lamp
I love the cupcake  because my cosion show the cupcake but angry and after that I called it "The angry cupcake"
ITS NOW OCTOBER AND 9 DAYS UNTIL YOU CAN SEE IF YOUR ARE RIGHT
17:24 as well as the missing eye. as we know golden freddy has two spirits inside it, reason why in the fnaf 3 bad ending we see two glowing eyes behind all the main 4 heads, which have only ONE eye lit. if this golden freddy (from the movie) has only ONE eye, it must mean that right now the only soul posessing is mike's brother, and NOT cassidy too (yet)
15:21 NOBODY NOTICES HIS CLOTHES??? HES THE CRYING CHILD DUH LOOK AT HIS SHIRT MATPAT.
Freddy spaghetti?
I've been using Google Duo since 2019 and it's been great. And then they renamed it to Google meet
I think I would  get kicked out if i scream  remnant
Fun fact: before the fandom knew her name was Elizabeth, everyone called her Abigail.
The fact that I was just on a family friendly channel…
How does Vanessa know the animatronics were possesed
that 5 kid had zebra shirt. what means that shes puppet?
17:57 “together we are fnaf!!”
i’m kinda upset that blumhouse didn’t put MatPat in the movie. Not sure where the franchise would be without him.
I still don't understand why would they need another security guard if they have vinessa
I think the kid with the striped shirt might be the Puppet. I'm not sure tho, but the fact that he has stripes on him makes it a pretty interesting design choice.
the questionable boy also has a striped shirt jst like crying child and it might not be the same amount of stripes but still therr
"Springtrap this isn't you"
I got a fnaf ad while watching this lol
Soo we are gonna ignore Matpat thinking the kid in striped shirt isn't crying child? I know they have difirent color hair but still
I am so annoyed with you keep spoiling the game and movie
15:09 The kid is gonna be the Puppet! @FilmTheory look at his shirt, its the lines exactly the same
Google Meat
15:48 does that mean like Bon Bon from sister location can also be victim to this?
The kid has blue pants and a striped shirt
They mixed everything together for this film like they did with that Mortal Kombat movie
When the pandemic started me and my friends used Google meet to talk. Those are my fondest memories that I’m glad I didn’t loose.
We're spoiling the movie with this one
I am freddy. 🙂
16:12 OMG YES BC ALSO HE HAS THE LJTTLE MIDDLE PART OF HIS HAIR GOING DOWN HIS FACE LIKE CRYING CHILD/EVAN
at this point just make a fnaf theory channel
It’s coming I ur soon I’m so excited I’ve been excited since august
I swear if this movie has a happy ending, I will literally throw my TV out the window and even if I watch in the movie theatre I’m taking the TV and throwing it out the window
To stuff people
Yo stuff people
I think the drill is something they use for the animatronics
Lowkey I think it takes place in the saw universe
Hey matpat,the whole "kid being cupcake" is a good theory...but look at the blonde kid...Blonde hair...looking menacingly...I think it's "the one you should not have killed" from ucn
I know I’m late to this discussion, but, canonically Golden Freddy has two souls. With Chris Afton, (Also known as Evan Afton) and Cassidy (Also known as the one he/you should not have killed) being those to souls. The reason Goldie’s eye is blue is because Chris is possessing him. This color appears in his right eye. But when Cassidy is possessing him his left eye is red. When both are possessing him at once, both eyes with have the color assigned to them.
As much as I love how there’s a fnaf movie coming, I don’t like it when trailers keep getting released and more and more scenes get revealed. At this point I feel like I’ve watched the whole movie. For example, we have Barbie, there were only a few trailers, but there was nothing that actually spoiled the movie or spoiled too many scenes. Can others also input their opinions into this??
Willy’s wonderland knock off
Please don’t delay this again
i think this will be the only movie that everyone will be okay with or happy with if the ending is wicked and sad
I really don’t want to throw you under the bus but  THE KID IN THE YELLOW HAT IS GOLDEN FREDDY AND THE KID IN THE YELLOW STRIPED SHIRT IS FREDDY
If he’s not in the movie I ain’t watching it 💀
I got a add for the movie when I was watching this lol
bro got sposored by google
the bad rabbit was not their father? in my memory, his big brother try to protect his little sister when he realized their father kills those kids
It’s would be puppet the kid who had that’s shirt
MAT ITS NOT OUT YET
IM WATCHING IT ON THE 24TH THE PG12 ONE IN CINIMAS THEN THE 18+ ONE AT HOME MY SISTER DONT KNOW HOW EXOTER I AM ABT THIS AHHHAHAHAGAHGGG
"Whops! Thats gonna leave a mark." -Nedbear
I think the fifth unindentified children is the puppert because his cloths.
FNAF 3 WAS SET IN 2023
my theory is that that golden freddy cuz look at cassidy it looks really simliar
Take a look at the child you said was gonna be cupcake shirt striped like the puppet also he is kinda skinny a characteristic of the puppet
so you don’t think we’re gonna see the springlock scene in this movie? because many people have the theory that the movie is going to end with the scene of William being springlocked and personally I also believed that the movie was going to end like that but now I have no idea
Good. No part with spring lock failure. I don’t want to see that.
REMNANT?
The fact that fnaf has gone from the game theorists channel to the film theorists channel brings a tear to my eye 😢
My brother predicted it. We knew he was gonna have a           f-cking aneurism over this movie.
My guess is the blond girl in the drawing is the police officer. She sticks out like a sore thumb in that picture
STOP I GOT AN ADD FOR THE MOVIE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF WATCHING THE VID 😭😭
My god
Did anyone have the movie ad while watching
"Keep your eyes on your monitors" people watching this on a smart fridge"😐"
The one part of this theory I’m upset with is the cupcake theory. MatPat never mentioned that the 5th kid was wearing a striped shirt! That easily connects them to the puppet in my eyes, or even the Crying Child! Just a thought I had to lay down, great theory otherwise <3
IT HASN'T EVEN RELEASED 😭
i think garret is golden freddy because in the game mikes brother died and became golden freddy so why not do something similar in the movie and make that Garett has been kidnapped (and unfortunately died) and became golden freddy that would explain why is he has good relationship with Abby
I think it will  take  place in  family  During
I think it will take  place in the family  During
Love your channel by the way❤
7 DAYS LEFT WOOOOOO
opium bird
Lol the 5th kid is crying child bc it has the striped shrit
Ngl we need the springlock scene to happen
"It's like me, Markiplier,is right here in the movie. " *wink* *wink* He said that in his Fnaf1 freedom roam video. Just wanted to let you know!
google meet another way to spy your conversations cause the product is you
Matpat is the type of guy to spoil a movie before it even comes out
Steve Raglin is an anagram for everlasting, which fits William's phrase "I always come back"
I like the cupcake theory. I originally thought that kid was the crying child since his shirt is striped with similar colors, but him being the cupcake would also be cool
I love and have played almost everysingle game (except fnaf security breach)...    but I AM TOO YOUNG TOO WATCH A MOVIE BASED OF A GAME I PLAYED WHEN I WAS 6 WOWWWWE YOUR TAUNTINH ME NOW ARENT YOU!?
This movie makes zero sense.
My theory is that  Mike gets the job and goes there
I love the reference of time traveling in the ball pit from five nights at Freddys Fraz bear frights
It would be kind of funny if everyone wore a Foxy, Bony, Chica, or Freddy mask while watching this movie in the theaters
15:16 maybe the marionette. I know Charlie is a girl but the stripes match the marionettes design
Matpat is either going to eat his word and be horrendously wrong, or he's going to prove us wrong and be surprisingly right 😂
tbh i want a post credit scene of Abby and golden freddy doing silly little antics, some wholesome stuff yk
fnaf 2 sister location
1 WEKK AWAY!,!
Ahhhh, one week until the movie comes out and the 9 minute "teaser" already threw a wrench in this- Shadow Freddy is in the movie also xD
Markiplier!
Me: *causally watches this fnaf video* YouTube: Hm.... Fnaf movie trailer time!
Bet afton dies and becomes springtrap
So where is Michel then 😭
bro for a second i thought the start was an ad-
It takes place in the 2000s
In the UK it’s rated 15+ so some fnaf fans can’t watch it including me 🥲
The fifth kid is golden Freddy because he has the striped shirt like crying child who’s soul gets put in golden Freddy.
In these movies I hope that they include the spring lock scene just like it happened in the game
I have a theory that the one kid in the forest that doesnt have an obvious animatronic reference the un marked kid could be crying child because both of their shirts look the same
17:58 i feel like the kids mike sees are going to help, maybe recreate the end of fnaf 3.
Wasn’t there a theory that there was two kids stuffed into one suit which could make sense with the cupcake and chica
The strips remind me of the marionette puppet 🤷🏻‍♀️
i was gonna watch this but i dont want spoilers
I believe at the end of the movie, we will get the spring lock fail scene. But as that happens, it will give Elizabeth the opportunity to interact with baby, like we see in the 8bit game from Sister Location.
As of now, I don't believe Abby will be baby as you predict. ( Unless they are changing the eye color of the girl playing Abby.)  But just like in the game,  the eyes go from blue to green for Baby. Or do you believe this is a editing thing?
aaahhh yes, i lov google schmeat
why would you jumpscare me😢
If bro says google meets one more time… I will actually download it
They gonna pull the movie back and then refill it to destroy the theory
Markiplier hasn’t licked a stick
Idk, i think top hat kid is golden freddy and the one with rhe brown shirt is freddy
tbh i think when afton messes with her, i think he also turns her into Vanny or something like that. for latter movies to betray mike.
just so you know its not some "unknown torture device" I have noticed some key details showing that it is actually a form of 'death by suit' like in fnaf 1 😁
I think its interesting that springtraps right half is old looking and has holes but the left side is totaly intact. Why?
Your videos never cease to make me just.. drop a hot steaming log in my pants cause of the undiscovered lore. Thank you.
I always thought that mysterious boy was the crying kid hint the shirt he was wearing and being the center of the children
Is he never gonna get cancelled for these?
15:29 what
I want a theory explaining why people think it's okay to let a 10 year old have a social media account, even if he is an actor.
Can’t wait for some to put free bird over Afton death in the movie
No baby is Elizabeth afton
I was figuring the boy in the striped shirt was probably the puppet, given the striped shirt and the puppet’s striped arms/sleeves
We could also possibly consider the Puppet and if not the mysterious kid soul then Abby could become the Puppet.
I feel like i jelust watched the fnaf movie in 20 minutes
Anyone else think that this is literally just the GEN-Z version of judge Judy?? To be honest it kind of seems like it.
No spoil alert?
i found out FnaF a few years ago but horror wasn't really something that interested me then, i've gotten slightly more interested in the past year.
what if the fifth kid was like the puppet or something he had like a striped shirt??? just a random thought.
MatPat keep doing what you do, your really good at this stuff, and tbh your videos are great.
Here we again, Matpat tries to predict a movie's plot by the trailer alone only to invietably get it wrong
In my own opinion, I hate characters like Vanessa in horror films. Some how she knows everything and every detail about the horror going on. I’d much prefer if it was all up to mystery and surprise to the protagonist
*Bonnie faces Mike* “what’s your plan new guy.” “We must stick together… because together….we are fnaf.”
Me: “it hasn’t even came out yet-“ Matpat: don’t matter 😊
Oh @filmtheorist I have a theory about FNAF SB: think about how the fazbear company was talking in help wanted they were doing damage control on their reputation the pizzaplex was to try and reinvent their public image with a good family friendly place hence the more family friendly and inviting establishment but William is up to his old tricks by manipulating the vanny mask apparent by Vanessa’s change of behavior and tone when she puts it on
3:01 from the trailer (slow down to see the details of the device) it looks like an animatronic mask. I think Mike is being stuffed into the suit
ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET HOW????
All I can say is, you're close
I’m torn between wanting to watch this now but wanting to go in and watch the movie with no prior expectations ahhhhh ok I’ll watch it bow
i already know its not gonna be what matt says whats gonna happen but its fun to see what he thinks is gonna happen
Dose the cupcake have a soul?
13:20 mr consequences makes an appearance  I think you missed an Easter egg Matt 😮
I NEEED a video about the amazing digital circus!! Its amazing and id love to hear ur theorys on it!
Google Meet?!
Mhm WRONGGG
Garrett = the goleden Freddy lokin guy
That actor is from zathura the movie that’s was scarier then fnaf
Is one of the actors from that weird space movie where a house is in space?
15:05 juro, eu achava que esse garoto era o freddy, e o garoto de cartola era o golden freddy... e isso não sai da minha cabeça. Ele tá vestindo marrom, todos tem suas cores, exceto o garoto de cartola, ele veste um tipo de amarelo com branco. não sei, nunca se encaixa quando dizem que ele que é a alma do freddy D:
Aiden?!!??!!!
Sister location would actually make sense considering that Abby is a anagram for baby and baby is the main animatronic for sister location but since Abby is mikes sister it would only make sense for the title “sister location” to actually be mike Schmidt’s sisters location therefore explaining the hidden meaning behind the title sister location and what happened to Abby(or Baby)
I rly hope they cover all of Scott's games. Like this covers the 1st game and hopefully if there's gonna be more, it will cover all the games. I sincerely doubt there's gonna be 5 movies of fnaf but it's something to look forward to. And maybe just maybe Scott will be in one of them. I rly hope so tho lol. I'm also wondering if they would sum the story with the other games. For instance Mike didn't get his brother in that whole incident with Golden Freddy. But apparently Afton took his younger son to experiment the remnant process. And I'm probably writing too much but just one more thing lol, I rly want them to make the fnaf lore easier to understand. These years I've been given too much, sayin that Micheal possessed foxy in fnaf 4 but if that's the case then why do we play as him in SL?  SL takes place after fnaf 4 so- eff it.. my brain is hurting for thinkin too much 😑
I have a small theory where some of if not all animatronics will not help and keep trying to get Abby
The spring trap will probably go off and who is in it/golden bonny/William Afton
Wait what is the fnaf movie on
I really hope Abby dose not die and I hope the children's souls get set free and if not I WILL GO TO MIKE HOUSE AND BECOME WILLIAM AFTON HIMSELF
I feel like Mike wouldn't die when the torture device is show it kinda looks like the first security gaurd
it better end with the FNAF song, otherwise i’m gonna be very sad 🎉
I HOPE IT ENDS LIKE THAT OMG
Had voided five nights at Freddy’s because I don’t like the horror genre in general. I only kept up with fnaf bc of game theory
I mean… there was a baby animatronic head at the blumhouse Halloween event so they might use it for the movie
everyone who noticed the striped shirt and blue pants on the kid similar to crying child O_O
Matpat what you didn't do didn't see the characteristic a characteristic of golden Freddy is the yellow shirt the kidAnd plusAnd think striped shirt
1. The break-in can’t be the opening scene. Kat is Abby’s babysitter and has scenes with her, so she can’t die in the opening.  2. If Abby does get killed, I could see her becoming Puppet rather than Baby. Thus, she becomes the animatronics’ protector, “one of them”.
Currently at universal
What’s five nights at Freddy’s
Unless the 5th boy is cassidy
GUESS WHAT! In the uk we get it on the 25th
If you look at the shirt the 5th kid is wearing it actually looks really similar to the cupcake wrapper
Solve this franchise sounds like game show MatPat would come up with-
guys that might sound crazy but my birthday is also october 27 so imagine how i freaked out when i first saw the release date btw i have been wathing all the channels since my chilhood your videos are so great
I think a more interesting theory is that the kid with blonde hair and the striped shirt is actually the Puppet, given how everything is coreographed. And that Abby is going to be Fredbear.
The kids the puppet with the stripes
Is this like shaggy from scooby doo Matthew Lillard? That’s just funny to me. (Ik he was in scream too)
It would have been so perfect, if he would have said "It's been so long.." in the beginning.
I find it funny that MatPat said " the movie is taking a bunch of stories from the game franchise and simplifying them for a general film audience." And then out comes Jason Blum saying they are only making the movie for the fans, that they aren't trying to expand the audience 😂 poor mat
It’s been so long!
Or hear me out, the mystery kid with the striped shirt is the puppet. We haven’t seen it in the trailer but it’s gotta be more than likely the puppet will be there. The shirt matches the aesthetic of the puppet and it would be weird if he was the only one to not be wearing something that reflected what animatronic he’s in.
2024 fanf is ending
Speaking of Peter the Ballad of Song Birds and Snakes is coming out and you should try to solve the trailer. It’s the story of Snow as a child.
Harharharharharharharharharhar
I think the child who you say is the cupcake is mike. i think the spirits make him have a dream flashback and they lead him to his memory getting him to look at it again so that he can link who spring trap is. they make hm remember it it a different way. they lead him there than run.
Could the first kidnapped kid be the marionette who wakes up the other animatronics?!  And that Matt lillard plays Michael aftons oldest son?!? Cause why else is there a golden bonny?!? I think Michael used the help wanted to lure William there, make sure the animatronics stayed there, and to prevent more people being killed by them. So michael can burn it to the ground, once he was trapped here. Cause remember in the series, there’s more than 1 purple guy
Can’t wait to see you in the fnaf movie
Let us watch the film in peace, stop spoiling it for us
15:46 also in help wanted its able to move by its own
Thanks Scott
good to note that matthew lillard has posted multiple photos of him on set with hashtags saying “purple” or “purpleguy “. he’s even stated that in a comment on a more recent post.
Google Meat
the 5th kid could be goldie bc he has blonde hair
If I'm honest, I feel like Vanessa is lying about the animatronics wanting to turn Abby into them to make Mike help them take apart the animatronics so William can get his hands on the endoskeletons to retrieve the remnant.
You said it your self it's been 8 years... STOP TRYNA MAKE US WAIT MORE WITH THESE "BEFORE THE RELEASE" THEORIES
Is Vanessa going to be good in this movie? She becomes a villain in the later games, so is her decline or reveal gonna be in this movie or a possible future one?
All my theaters are booked 😂
Blud movie didn’t even release yet💀
it comes out on my birthday!! ive been waiting for this movie for YEARS and i grew up with the franchise, so the fact it comes out on my birthday just makes me really excited lol. its been nearly a decade. i was 8 when the first game came out and i was obsessed with it from the get-go. now im gonna be 17. after so many false promises of a release and asking “is there gonna be a fnaf movie?” we are finally getting it and i just hope it lives up to my expectations after waiting for so long.
I’m definitely not the first o e posting this but I think the striped shirt kid is going to be the puppet
Five Nights at Freddys is DnD??? Joking but still, think about the torture machine that you dubbed a remnant extractor. Rolling a dice and getting a high roll can save mike from that. The animatronics can be controlled by the DM (dungeon master) and etc.
I learned about fnaf one year ago I am also 12 and I learned about fnia seven years ago
Calling it now, Mike will become Golden Freddy and that's him holding Abby's hand in the trailer.
I think the saw is the thing in the last story of into the pit
Last kid is wearing stripes…
Slow the f down the movie didn’t even release yet Btw i wore that fnaf costume for Halloween 5 years ago
It feels like a lost opprotunity to have not hired Matpat as an actor, hope that changes within the series
Great job with the theory
Fnaf Movie: “Hello! I my name is—“  MatPat: *LOOOOOORE!!!!!*
I better see a bunch videos on this after the movie comes out
Imagine your friends possessing individual animatronic characters with arms and legs and you get the cupcake.
MatPat… the movie isn’t even out yeeeet 😂😂😂
I swear if I don't see or hear a springlock failure, I'm starting a petition to get one in another film
the movie hasnt even came out lil bro
I don't think (or hope) the baby twist will be in this movie for strictly pacing reasons, I feel adding baby will either feel too forced or to rushed, and i would rather they take the time with baby rather than trying to cram her into this film
Withered glam rock star Freddy
And the 5th i think its balloon boy cause of the kids drawings on the wall
The kid with the stripe t shirt is marionette or balloon boy
Not me about to watch the 60+ vids that mat pat has made.
Some fans theorized that Garrett Hines as Mike’s dad isn’t his biological father but his step father. What do you think?
Isn’t Scott retiring after this?
Five Nights at Freddy's is Cool 2:53
What if Abby was the other half of golden Freddy
My introduction to fnaf was an employee telling us aboult the alleged hauntings and murders that happened at that Dave n busters. Not gonna lie we was tipsy but he was a great storyteller. When I got home to google it I found a fnaf video lol
it hasnt even come out yet and he has figured it out
This is the first I have heard of this, because Luciferian Religious Leaders craft protective magick.
I’m soooooo hyped for the FNAF Movie, and this Theory was Interesting, we’ll see how much your Theory holds up MatPat. _We’ll see~^^_
THATS BECAUSE ITS STILL SPRINGBONNIE
Me: I can’t wait “Mikes sister is named Abby” Me being named abbi This is going to be a long ride
Introducing William Afton, or as he was known in his teenage years, Shaggy. Nothing was ever the same after he lost his beloved family dog...
cant wait for the Food theory
Matpat:five Nights at Freddy’s  Subtitles:five minutes at Freddy’s 😂
I thought mat said "thanks for Google *MEAT* " and I'm like ayo not that Oreo flashback again
7:43 OR you have Matthew doing his signature move from Scream 😔🙃🙃
FNaF never has a good ending the “true ending” for every game past the first 2 involves death arson and trauma
Don't know if it is just me why does the death trap look like moscot mask
it takes place in the 2000s
Shouldnt the next movie actually be a prequel
I'm hyped for the movie and so far from what I've seen and heard here if true, I think it's gonna be good. After the trailers always wondered how'd they do the story with all the games and books. But I like the idea of the original story being mixed with the new to try and make a cohesive plot for the audience. Plus after Matt explained who's maybe golden Freddy that just be a great tear jerker for the movie.
I'm confused, isn't Mike Schmidt and Michael Afton the same person?
Just a thought, a very small thought. We saw in the trailer how Garret was kidnapped and most likely killed, and like you pointed out Lucas commented on Matthew's post about how he was much nicer then his character, this might be a bit far off but i'm kinda thinking that garret is the replacement for Charlie, It is kinda just something that popped up in my mind because they are pretty similar, both young, both have brown hair, and they were killed by the same person, and still having a parental figure grieving. If we are going off of that both of mike's parents died and mike is the parental figure, This could be a pretty good theory but the only i really struggle with is that well, how would this be useful? I'm not sure but i'm just proud of it for kinda making a good theory, so :)  okay new thing abt like the theory, your theory. Who would be the cassidy?
Your right Steve raglan must be Afton he uses fake names all the time plus I saw him at a convention and he said I always come back on the signature
BOUGHT MY TICKETS 🥹🥹🥹🥹😀😀😀😀
Ready for Two more
That jumpscare scared me
Actually the fnaf movie was filmed in New Orleans and thats the nebraska poster the franchise story was set in utah though
The fifth kid is the cupcake
It didnt even come out bro
The fifth kid is also wearing a stripped shirt so what if he is the puppet and not the cupcake?!?! Just a theory
I feel like the animatronics befriending Abby is nothing more complicated than "She's a kid. They like kids"  And everything else is just adults misinterpreting that because they don't know the animatronics are posessed by... Kids who were killed by an adult. So overall even the behavior of the animatronics would match the first game.   I do think she will become baby though. I don't like the security guard being Vanessa... If she was an Adult by the 80's, by current FNAF time she couldn't be. Maybe her mother or grandmother would fit better? Idk  i'm not a writter
WHY FNAF MOVIE THERES SO MUCH FOR ME TO DO I CANT EVEN REACH THE MOVIE IVE GOTTA PLAY GHOSTBUSTERS VR AND THEN… okay maybe i do have some time
What I don't understand is how Mike doesn't recognize his father?
What if the fifth child is the crying child, because of his shirt? Or is he one of the other ones?
I love google meet by the way I use it to call my friends!
That would make sense bec Abby (=baby=Elisabeth) is then the sister of golden Freddy (her lost brother=the crying child ) and mike is again the last ne alive like in the games
i feel like you just spoiled the whole movie bro now im not gonna go watch it
Yeah but how would ol’ billy afton stuff a 10yr old into a cupcake
I hate you so much because I actually understood what you said.
no one is probably gonna see this but why do i feel the 5th kid is maybe the puppet or crying child just because of his design of his shirt
i feel like this other kid that wasn’t identified is funtime foxy or mangle, i mean it kinda makes sense considering if they make a sequel is will most likely be based on fnaf 2 (or prequel considering fnaf 2 was a prequel of fnaf 1) and if abby is going to be baby, there should be other funtimes. i mean, funtime foxy is the only character from sister location to not have an idea of who may be possessing them (funtime freddy - the girl from count the ways, baby - elizabeth or abby, and ballora - some kind of stand in for mrs afton)  edit: mangle cuz in the forth closet mangle and funtime foxy are similar beings, + mangle was a very important antagonist in fnaf 2 (bc of them being the primary suspect of the bite of 87 NOT 83) it would just make sense to be introduced in the first movie.
the movie aint even out yet bro 😭😭😭😭
Is the 5th kid william afton’s son ?
The only theory I want on the movie is why tf mattpatt isn't in it
Since I live in the UK, I’ll be checking if MatPat is right on this theory if I watch it. Spoiler Alert: I think he is right
In my 29 years I've learned one fact in life, if Matthew Lillard is in the movie, he's Shaggy, or the Villain.
Hope they’ll add the springlock failure part though ToT
Hey MatPat! It's good to see that, despite the time it took, you made a film theory on the FNAF Movie. I believe I have the answer to the cupcake confusion. We have known that the cupcake was separate from Chica since FNAF VR: Help Wanted. A portion of the Chica parts and service level was trying to catch the jumping, moving cupcake and put it back on the plate. The part that is more interesting is that Chica cares for this cupcakes, as if you don't put it back in time you get jump scared. Thank you for listening to my response.
99% of this i feel like will come true but theres gotta be that one twist that even has matpat like”😮”
Bruh
The last kid with the striped shirt I think is the puppet spirit
5:58 real quick, I thought Mike Schmitt was Michael afton, and Abby was supposed to be Elizabeth afton?!?
The only thing I'm a bit skeptical of within this theory is Abby being baby(Or going to be) only because when Abby talks she sounds like Balloon Boy- especially with the "Hello", which is probably what the animatronics wanted to make out of her. And in the game Balloon Boy is there...maybe Afton tries again? Who knows. Otherwise I love this theory! Keep up the good work Matpat
13:40 INTO THE PIT REFRENCE
if this is the plot im killing myself that night
I believe Shmidt is Ms.Aftons Last name before marriage that’s why Baby/Elinor is called Elinor Shmidt
When MatPat brought up how this movie is gonna be combining aspects of different parts of the franchise, it made me think of Sonic 2, which took aspects of the first three Sonic games. Stuff like Labyrinth Zone (Sonic 1), Tails (Sonic 2), Knuckles (Sonic 3), the Master Emerald (Sonic 3), and Super Sonic (Sonic 2). Basically Sonic 2 (the movie) took stuff from the first three games, and some stuff from Adventure; I think, and simplified them for a viewing audience.
I’m saying you’re wrong matpat
How do you figure something out that hasn’t been released yet?!?!
All I hear is har har har har har har har har har har
The fifth kid has a striped shirt, don’t know if it has any correlation to the puppets stripes but, just something I noticed
Matpat gets a phone call after this upload*  Mat: hello ?*  “Hi uh matpat it’s Emma tammi calling”  Mat: “oh my god hello there what can I do for you”  “We are going to need you to please take down your whole FNAF moive theory as you basically just gave the whole moive away* Matpat: is speechless*
That “remnant extractor” may actually be the Freddy Fazbear suit that was referenced by Phone Guy in FNAF 1!
Hope this movie doesnt get delayed from this theory and not become a buggy mess like security breach
strange i thought the unmasked/linked boy was crying child because of his stripped shirt... i guess we'll see!
Mat could be wrong here, mikes dad could be his adoptive dad, after what happened.
Yep! Me and my cousin can’t wait to watch this film
Bro the movie not even out yet chill bro 💀😭😭😭😭
Theory:what if Mike went into the ball pit and that's how he got the flashbacks
i really really want to watch the springlock activate in the movie
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But didn´t Elizabeth died before Evan ?? 17:31
BTW the cupcakes name is carl. Carl the cupcake.
The movie hasn’t even came out yet chill😭😭
I HAVE ALL 3 OF THOSE
okay wait a sec…Abby being the kid who got kidnapped her brother would make sense. Abby or Baby hinting at she is basically Elizabeth which Elizabeth becomes Baby!
yea the anomotronics fight back then afton gets spring locked
He really spoiled the movie before it even released
so popular that google sponsors you that has to be some sort of achievement
bro solved the movie before it released
🎮
📽️
Is it just ne who noticed that when you saw the five children, the one you thought was cupcake had cc clothes
I dont think that counsellor is Ol willy. If he was and Mike S could possibly be Michael then wouldnt he at least recognise him? But im just speculating because they aren’t giving a lot of hints in the trailer. It does look interesting and would make sense that abby would become baby as 1) no parents 2) little brother dead/missing and only 2 siblings left and 3) there are 5 members for the afton family.
That device looked like a scooper to me immediately
maybe the kid in the striped shirt might be a gender swapped puppet since the puppet kid got killed at the first location as well, (i know the puppet is suppose to be aftons buisness partners daughter) but what if they just gender swapped the kid to stay ambiguous????? thoughts????
im pretty sure the kid he said was cupcake, actually did have a characteristic of an animatronic... or of CRYING CHILD... his striped shirt looks like C.C's, so he probably is golden freddy... which is really sad.
Can you please do an episode on angel hair it’s going to end soon and I want you to review it before it ends. Thank you so much Matt Pat for all your wonderful videos you’re probably not going to see this comment but thank you.
Why are the animatronics c.g ? It would be soooo easy to make them as practical effects .
BRO FOR REAL CALLED SPRING BONNIE A CHARACTER HE HAS TALKED ABOUT AND CALLED HIM A FIXED SPRINGTRAP WHICH YES IS TRUE BUT COME ON MATPAT YOU KNOW BETTER!!!! Sorry caps lock was on
You forgot something at the end, SPRINGLOCK SCENE. /hj
I honestly thought the fifth kid was the Puppet due to the stripes on his shirt.
Is this going to be like Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City? You know, smashing a couple games into one movie?
as someone who has actively avoided this franchise for the last decade, on purpose, solely because i was a hipster and thought that if everyone else liked it i wouldn't, i only started watching your videos and anything else talking about fnaf...two days ago. for the SOLE purpose of preparing to see my absolute favorite actor of all time. so, understandably, i am disappointed that you didn't know he's literally 31 😂 great video though, and thank you for breaking everything down for a reluctant new fan like me
5:01 unless u live in texas
I think the cupcake therory kid is right
The 5th kid has stripes though, could it be puppet?
...yeah this theory sucks. Anway not gonna bother watching the full episode.
bc willam afton died in the suit then he turned to a purple spirit so i have feeling he possesed the suit the kids ran i have the feeling that was willam afton who was killing the kids
so im thinking that abby wont die
so i have feeling that venessa is wrong
and the reason why i think willam afton is taking control think about it willam afton would put kids in suit
if the animontrics was trying to make abby like them i dont think they want her to be like them i think they are trying to protect her and i think because golden freedy some shots showed that he was nice not like deadly including foxy when he saw her he wasnt like taking her to a place that will turn her into one and i have a feeling that willam afton is possing the spring trap  and thats why he came out bc he wants him so gone so he has the chance to turn abby to one of them so thats why i think thats why they dont want her to be a amimontronic
HOLD UP think about it
That’s my big sister birthday:)
btw abby is mikes daughter and i feel like vanessa is gonna turn out to be vanny or smth
That kid can't be the cupcake, I bet it's the marionette. Mainly because of he's shirt with stripes resembeling him.
They make for her nap cause like furry suits like actual first of the animatronics cause play as one we’re like a Freddy, pretty certain workaround affair contention because it’s technically Kānoa furry
LORE?!?!?!?!
Bruh my name is wyatt
Oh matpat you poor poor soul you'll never escape from fnaf the ride never ends on this one 😅
Mike is actually Michael Afton
Nah dawg i think the kid with the stripped shirt is Gregory who died when the bite of 87 happened
some times im really mad mat THE FIFTH KID IS OBVIOUSLY THE CRYING CHILD LOOK AT THE SHIRT MAN
He just theorized the entire fnaf movie with just the trailer
It makes a lot of sense after the ending of Megan as well. Reminds me of how the little girl teams up with the old robot creation of her aunt's to defeat Megan.
YASS ONLY A WEEK AFTER MY BIRTHDAYY
ok but something i'm keeping a close eye on is the casting list. Like, i mean... Mary Stuart Masterson is now casted as aunt Jan, but a little while ago her role was called "female villain"....
Bro no one watched that movie and he already “SOLVED” IT?
What if this Mike Schmidt becomes phone guy 😂
If they cut Michael Afton out of the lore completely I’m gonna be so mad bro💀
He’s not cupcake look at his shirt
13 DAYS 23 HOURS AND 33 MINUTES TILL I SEE IT
Scooper
Instead of it Abby being sucked up by circus baby I think that it will be ballon boy or a new version of balloon bot made for a girl like de de I mean listen to her say hello outside the stage
nah the theory of Nebraska has to be wrong...ain't no soul wants to be here
That cup cake has a name Carl🧁
Bro I have a theory for the kid that’s supposedly the cupcake it’s puppet maybe because he has a striped shirt
The last kid is the puppet cause of his stripped sleeves
15:13 hey don’t u notice the striped shirt? How it doesn’t have any special characteristics, other than the shirt? Well, I believe it’s either the Crying Child or the Marionette
8 years 💀 I feel old
MatPat is the only youtuber who can sell merch, and talk about sponsorships, and isn’t annoying.
what if the one of the kids is controling the machine that kills people
i have a theory
How is bro solving something that’s not out yet give it a rest
How come a portion of this video is sponsored by Google Meet?!
Bro the movie hasn't even come out and he already solved the lore💀
I have Google meet
I audibly went “ohhhhhhhh😲”
what if the kid is CC not cupcake
I'm wondering if there's going to be a reveal that Vanessa in this movie is going to be a sibling to one of the five victims. It'll give her a reason to know so much about the place, and give Mike and her something to bond over.
I still can't believe that little ol fnaf is getting peeta mellark in it's movie.
I see why you think the fifth kid is the cupcake but the kid's striped shirt reminds of the marionette. The stripe pattern matches. The colors don't but the stripes themselves do
It's coming out on my birthday!!
5th kid has a stripped shirt ps crying  child
I need remnant now to live forever ♾
BRUH ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET LIKE LEAVE IT ALONEEEWW (JOKE JOKE JOKE!!)
And this man is the reason why we wont have a second fnaf movie
The Cupcake theory is goofy
Me waiting for Style theory to have fnaf
17:47 first of all, it's not springtrap, it's withered springbonnie, he's not withered enough to be springtrap and he's not unwithered enough to be springbonnie 18:24 and it's probably unlikely that Abby will turn into circus baby at the end, because of the coryxkenshin taxi cameo, it's most likely at the end of the movie Abby will go off to some place else that has some sort of significance in the fnaf movie timeline
I stayed in Utah for school and I like it a lot more knowing my childhood was based in here
I think that the “cold open” is actually going to be when the old security guard is killed because it shows that the job is vacant now. Also, one of the the thieves is labeled on IMDb as Max, Abby’s babysitter, so I don’t think that she would go to the pizzeria, die, and then go and work as a babysitter for Abby.
I am so excited for the bite of ‘89 (iykyk)
Sixteen days
The machine is likely for how they make the night guard a Freddy animatronic
Watch the drawings change from the trailer, the theater, and the disk/download
The only thing that would make this movie better is if I came out a day earlier than scheduled to prove it really has that Scott Cawthon stamp of approval
We heading out the Pizzeria with this one🔥
Where golden Freddy
I swear to god, if springtrap is not in dead by daylight after this movie!
imagine if Lillard's character really is just a career counselor, and he appears in every movie to give our protagonist a job at Freddy's, like Mike in the first movie, Fritz in the second, and Jeremy in the third
Idk if it means anything, but Steve Raglan is an anagram for Strangle Eva
Maybe they don’t want to turn abby into the animatronics, maybe they’re trying to protect her from Afton?
2:35   I have commented this on other videos before, and I will comment it again. I believe that this device is this movie showing what it is like being shoved into an animatronic suit. As a reference to the first game. ;3
Im not even watching the movie and my heart is already pounding, I loved m3gan and I know I will love the gang movie just as much!
If bro isnt in the movie it ain't watching
Man you probably ruined that kid's career by exposing his leaks on social media
I recently read The Twisted Ones and I have a prediction. I predict that, like you said, the animatronics will team up against Afton, but I think, what happens next is: while the main characters are escaping, Afton gets the jump on Abby and kills her. I just wonder if the part after that is the same as the twisted ones.
Look at the crying child’s shirt, that child is the puppet remember its the details hidden in plain sight
Biggest difference that might upset you: There are regular office doors.
you work on youtube... which is owned by google... and google owns meets... so you technically got a sponsor from the "boss" of your "boss"
I think the saw thing is an animatronic
I think  the idea that. Mike, wanting to go and live in. Nebraska is hilarious. Like nebraska seriously That's one of the weirdest places to want to go.😂😂
The fact that Matt didn’t pick up that unknown kid is going to be the puppet is upsetting
This video proves to me that he's probably not going to make an appearance in the movie, this franchise would be nothing without him and Mark 😭
Well like, look at the stripes on the last kids shirt. What if he becomes the puppet/marionette?
Fnaf is coming out on my 24th birthday
I was hoping they'd either do fnaf 1 focusing on the events of fnaf 1 and then a fnaf 2 3 4 etc or have the first movie be about fnaf 1-3 and then the 2nd movie being about 4-6 and the movie 3 being about Fnaf S.L,Ar,Vr,S.B
Mat, I think the extra kid is actually the marionette as the child has on a stripped shirt . So, this actually a possibility.
wouldent it be funny if they have no idea on what their going on about?
Hi mathew patrick
I WILL watch this movie, no matter whether anyone else wants to watch with me. My first horror movie when it comes out =)
I think the five kid will be the puppet because of his stripped shirt. I feels like that would be it.
around 13:00 I also found it very wierd that vanessa knew so much
THE MOVIE HASNT EVEN COME OUT YET
Wait is there coming a second fnaf movie? Or did I hear wrong 💀
Can you do Smurf cat please 🙏😿
.
This movie will be epic
I think it’s funny that MatPat is trying to convince us that Matthew Lillard plays as William Afton even though that by this point, everyone knows that it is so obvious
Matpat has resorted to cyberstalking child actors on instagram to form his fnaf theories
waittt it has to be afton’s first dead son, he’s wearing a striped shirt & it was his favorite.
What if we aren't starting from the beginning but we're starting from The Middle of the series and that the remnant theory of Afton taking the remnant is the story they're trying to tell us in this movie and they're also trying to tell us about, and there also trying to tell us how Vanessa got involved in the fnaf series and how she got brainwashed in the first place.
Bro I watched this and it ended at 11:00 exactly
Movie hasn't even released yet and already MatPat has solved it. Wait till there's a sequel, it'll be like William Afton coming back all over again.
I just want to mention hot topic has come out with some new fnaf jewelry (might be clothes too, not sure haven’t looked into it yet)
I swear, if they decide to set up "Mike is a robot" like with Charlie in the trilogy, imma lose it
The vanessa cop is unrelated to security breach Vanessa
It’s the way I am so exited for this movie
maybe that kid is the one he shouldn't have killed.cassidy i think
Matpat what happen if fnaf1 went to fnaf 2
15:44 Cupcake doesn't move alone, it's Chica who throws him towards the vandal. This fact is confirmed with FNAF 4, where we get a jumpscare from Cupcake in a very specific situation: if you close the door even without Chica being nearby, she will throw her Cupcake because she is far away. It's almost like, "Hey, you made a mistake. I didn't breathe near the door."
Cupcake = crying child
Ok hear me out Freddy turns cause the kid isnt the original or sum like that and thats why theres such an age gap between mike and maria
five nights at freddy deez nuts...................................................
The must be in freedbare diner
THIS ONE MAN IS SCOTT FOR REAL AM DONE
The jumpsacre mat pat why why
Contrary to MatPat I thought the kid with the striped shirt might be the Puppet.
the 5th child is wearing a striped shirt, prolly the puppet
Just imagine that Puppet is in the movie and they haven't showed nothing at all.
Yes the last fanfic
the machine is the scooper
the boy is the puppet his shirt is striped
5th kid could be the puppet?? similar stripe pattern
To be fair Cupcake’s candle is striped just like the fifth kid’s shirt soooo-
Bro solved a movie that hasn't even come out yet good job matpat
The movie took so long because they couldn’t find the place to film it. It took seven or six years to find a place to film it.
I think 5. missing kid is puppet
Your theory about Mike being Mike Afton is plausible. You’ve got Abby (Baby), the sister with the pink dress from FNAF 4. Crying child + Golden Freddy, Mom is MIA like usual, and Mike is secretly trying to find his brother and stop his father. You said it wasn’t bc someone else is playing as their dad but you also said the actor is young so it’ll likely be a flashback. So from that time when they were kids the father could have been William Afton
when he said it soundes crazy no its not my brain broke
"Alright gang, here's the plan"
I agree with you at 15:28 bec golden Freddy is Cassidy wich is a girl correct me if I’m wrong bec i might be
At 14:26 , is it just me or does he look more like glitchtrap, and not like spring trap. Or even vanny, and Vanessa was vanny all along, and just faked a injury, to hide her tracks???
i just realised their eyes are orange like the bad ending in FNaF.
But william aftons child is trapped in baby   it doesn't make sense
mike schmit is michel afton
I've been a part of the theorist community for several years now but I think imma say what might get me voted out: I dont care about the lore implications of the movie, or if it helps us get any closer to the current canon; as long as they do a good job with it I'll just enjoy like it's its own thing
You should solve the McGuffin in Pulp Fiction!
The only thing I wanna know is how much google payed for that long of a sponsor in this fnaf video
The fifth kid has a striped shirt so it’s either the crying child or the puppet
No cause Abby as Baby makes so much sense, since Abby is Mike's sister and potentially Golden Freddy's sister, with Golden Freddy as the crying child, we can assume that Abby is Elizabeth, and which animatronic is Elizabeth related with? yep, Circus Baby, idk why but its so cool finding that out
So what youre saying is the beginning of the film is literally cabinet man by lemon demon
I kinda feel bad, when that Lucas Grant kid left that comment, after people see this, they might get him into trouble cuz its kinda a spoiler and he is just a kid, i dunno, the chances of him getting in trouble are pretty big
Dawg, it hasn't even come out yet...
Killer robot videos back to back hu matpat
I actually wonder if it will be revealed that Mike and Garrett’s dad isn’t their real father. What if their real father is Matthew Lillard’s character, Afton or not?
only thing you’re missing on movie adoptions of games from this year is twisted metal. (i know it’s a show)
Not normal kids show on tik tok should be on this channel. Its really good
what if David Tennant, who is great at being creepy british guys, and is also the Purple Man in marvel, was Afton.
BRO CHILL IT AIN"T EVEN OUT YETTTTTT
I’m calling it right now there’s a somewhat happy ending if they wouldn’t let Smurfette die in the last Smurf movie that was animated even though the Smurfs are a almost dead franchise at this point what makes you think that they’re going to let a franchise like this have an ending where everyone dies when you have the type of ending there’s no money at the end of it but when you have a survivor that smells of a sequel which leads to money Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen, this is gonna be one heck of a ride.
the second from the let boy cupcake actually would make a lot of sense bc with that bowl cut he kinda looks like it
The kid without anything on his shirt or head is gonna be the cupcake that chika has. ( maybe )
The stripped shirt on the fifth kid. What if he's the puppet.
I agree with the cupcake theory, but I don't have the same reasoning. I feel like the stripes on the kid's shirt represent the lining of the cupcake. Idk it just makes more sense to me than the soul separating thing
omg, it's the first YouTuber that I watch using an android, and it's the man always makes me laugh and scared at the same time
15:23 Stripes tell me it's going to be the Puppet for a second movie.
Matpat might literally be spoiling the movie for us
How can you have figured the fnaf movie out?!?!? ITS NOT OUT YET
Bro probably spoiled the movie and it isn't even out
I already have the cookbook they sold it at my schools bookfair
Did he even read the books? The Cupcake was alive and laughing with Chica before Charlie electrocuted them both and we already know that a spirit can possess more than one animatronic
Amazing episode I love the channel!
So excited for this movie
REMANANT EXTRACTOR? I think its the scooper from SISTER LOCATION
MATPAT IS THE BEST FOR THIS. THANK YOU😭🥹
But matpat that’s not the Vanessa from security breach this one is not a afton
will the movie end with "michael, don't leave me here"
And ps I love videos and I’m going to make my own channel called peterplayz in 4 years
And if you do this theory I’ll give you a lot more
And I also think that the main character in the owl house actually got put into a coma by old Willy Acton
U can't solve the movie it hasn't even came out
Oh and just do a normal theory about the owl house
When I was watching Disney+ I saw that some Siri’s are in the same universe like  the owl house + amphibia and the little mermaid + Mickey Mouse Could you please do a theory
Mike is just using his mother’s last name
i feel like the unknown kid is the marionette
I have A theory for the pilot twist so when his brother garret disappearance I think Abby is also missing and Mike has mental problems having figment imaginations. Of Abby and she was taken away by Willam Afton as vanny tries to help mike get his mental issues under control or help him with his mental illness
Yeah but in the one scene with Coryxkenshin he is shown wearing modern day clothes
Abby dies, then golden freddy gets another eye, but it's a  different colour showing two different spirts, maybe?
Yay! Now i dont have to watch it
Sorry MatPat, I don't wanna hear a single mention of "Remnant" or "Agony" because they are the stupidest thing to ever come to the FNaF Series.
I remember an old theory Matpat made back in… around 2014-2015  Where he said the Puppet existed as far back as fnaf 1  So MAAAAAAYBE the kid with stripes could be the puppet and the **soul** reason ( … I’m sorry for the pun ) that they’re all alive
I thought abby would be golden freddy-
My guess is that vanessa being in the hospital and abby not being there is that this movie is just the part 1
I’m thinking that the last ghost child might be the puppet, just based on the stripes and I feel a good twist would be including Henry’s lore
I’m going to be spring Bonnie at the Fnaf movie
I would like to mention that the saw blade scene in the trailer was used before, back in 2018 in The Fourth Closet on page 212, its mentioned the those saw blades are used. It may not seem the same but trust me they're the same thing
how tf did he already figure it out even tho it hasn't even came out...
Sadly Mike isn't killy william's son
Matpat is annoying aaaaaaaaaaaaa
my brain too dumb to understand allat
Bros solve the movie even tho the movie isn't out
Didn't the kid who possessed FredBear aka golden freddy have a striped shirt on? Maybe that's the kid who doesn't have any real indication as to what animatronic he is?
willy is in your walls
when I first heard about the fnaf movie I wanted to watch it. But after watching this video I'm more interested and more excited about the movie. I can't wait to watch it. and Matpat thank you for telling us this. But if the movie gets canceled because of him I'm blaming him, cant wait to watch it 😃😃😃😃
Scott has to stop making trailers because matpat is just too good
just so everyone knows. if eight years ago, if we chose slenderman, this man would have his sanity
one thereory is that vannessa is working with afton (like in SB) because she doesn't look concerened and afton prob injured her to cover up them working together, because he has to come back (also the mathhew confirmed in a tweet (i think it was i tweet dont remember) that he is going to say "I Always Come Back" aftons catchphrase
The fifth kid is the crying child, he's got the same striped shirt.
Steve is gonna be purple guy because they said the actor for Steve raglan(Scooby-Doo actor)was gonna be purple guy and google says it
What if they use mat pats idea for part of the movie?
I just googled the cast and MATTHEW LILLARD DOESNT HAVE A NAMED ROLE. He could be anybody, but I'm gonna bet ny frontal lobe that he's supposed to be an ambiguous character who is revealed to be William Afton
15:05  maybe they’re Shadow Freddy???
it's very interesting that social media got brought into the trailer lore. definitely a different way to give exposition
Im just confused why william killed his own child??? didnt he go crazy bcs his son diedd😅
Really !!! 60 episodes of Fnaf on Game Theory 😮😮😮. I remember when it was just 15.
i stopped at 2:10 so i don't get any spoilers
I use meet for more than you’d think outside of work 💀💀💀
So, you didn’t get a cameo & if you did, you didn’t get an NDA to not spoil the movie
would have been awesome if you wee in the movie with petta malrk ngl
17:40 like how in the game he get into the suit to get away from the kids and the suit spring locks him
Micheal afton =  Mike Smidt Elisabeth Afton: Abby Smidt  Guys, Abby is a nickname for elisabeth, google it!
The yellow one is golden fredy
Just having a little wonder moment. The child could be Mimic? or Aftons Younger self expieriencing trauma
7:12 Why he not ourple?
Imagine trying to watch the movie and hearing matpat talk about different lore related stuff throughout and not shut up about it
...
If the fnaf movie is truly coping the silver eyes then I think that the animatronic’s Andy trying to make Abby them let me explain so in the books one of the nephews of the main characters meets the animatronic’s and at first they think there tring to hurt him but that’s what the animatronic’s think too but then both sides find out that they were both wrong so I think that’s what’s going to happen the animatronics try to protect Abby because they think the main characters are going to hurt her only to find out that there not hostile
you should make a video about dead sound
"Solved"
Golden freddy is sans lol
No I think the anamtronics are going to do the SPRINGLOCK and golden Freddy is Mike because that saw seen It looks like a Freddy mask and Abby/baby is Elizabeth Afton and in the 2nd movie it will have the baby insdent and i speck for all of us that we what the bite of 83 in there but that just me Film theorists what do you think??
pretty sure that the cupcake attacking the guy is a reference to the FNAF 4 chica jumpscare
I THINK THAT SUSIES DOG IS POSSESING THE CUPCAKE
Imgine if its canceled because the actor gone, and the police cant figure it, and suddenly mattpat comes,
the scariest part of this video... I thought it was sponsored by Google Meat 😅
I wonder how mad the film makers would be if you just completely just solved the entire movie before it even came out.
good thing i watched all the game theory fnaf videos
Bro the movies not even out yet
The 5th kid is pprbably the crying child, look at the clothes, they match
That remment extracter is just a Freddy's mask
so… mike isnt the son of william in this adaptation?  edit: i swear if i dont see a live action version of the bite of 83’, im opening up my own pizza chain
Bruh. @Film Theory. I think u missed something. I think the 5th child is the crying child
2:41 it’s like the scooper from sister location I think it’s the same but w saws
Matpat, the thing you called a remnant collecter, is the puppet carver from the book
the "cupcake" kid has a striped shirt so many its the puppet instead? since its got stripes???
film theory on five nights of fun ripoff at chuck e cheese pretty please Matt
I will say as someone who is weirdly obsessed with Honda Accords, I can tell you front and center that Mike's car is NOT a 1990 Honda Accord, that can't be any older than 2005.
7:20  If you go onto the website, it literally says that Lilliard is playing Afton. So it’s been confirmed for a while…
Matpat!!!! I know there's a low chance you'll see this but I think I found something about those saw things coming from Freddy's face.. The fourth closet graphic novel page 114 first panel I found the novel today in my schools library and later at night I decided to read a bit. I saw this panel and instantly remembered this video. The saw things coming out of her face look awfully similar to the ones coming out of Freddy in the trailer. I don't know if this is important or not but I just wanted to let you know we have actually seen it in the franchise before or at least something like it.
Mat your theory might be wrong i think Vanessa is the one that going to die instead of abby because idk
MatPat noooo! The movie hasn't even come out yet!!
didn't the actor post a picture with the caption saying william afton?
“Waiter, there’s a game theory in my film theory.”
I am so excited!!! I swear when it comes out before the film starts I’ll say “YOU READY, FREDDY!!!!!” “We’ve been waiting for this a long time!”
i feel like a bunch of 25 year olds and 12-15 year olds eill be stocking the movie theatres ... sigh
I feel like they should show Circus Baby in the post credit scene (if there will be one.)
I have google meet it's great
Last kid is the crying child i’m saying it either crying child or the marionette def not that cupcake mike’s missing brother has to be golden freddy
I think the extra child is  golden freddy since he is blonde.
I expected more lore-conflicts and another “final” timeline.
Ready Freddy (;
another thing i'd like to point out, Cassidy doesn't seem to be involved in the movie universe. you would expect golden freddy to have 2 different colored eyes symbolising the two spirits of crying child and cassidy, but there's only one glowing eye.
Idk if this counts as a fashion line but Hot Topic has a lot of FnAF merchandise including clothes
The fnaf movie maker will send an assassin
ITS GONNA BE THE BEST AA (i wont be able to watch it for 2 reasons 💀, 1 i dont go to theatres. 2 i don't got peacock and im not spending 15.99 bucks a month.) Wish it was on Netflix 🥲🥲 (i was told the fnaf movie won't ever happen and it happened ^^ (edit) during 2014 fnaf used to be a free game, and i used my moms phone and got it and i remember it became a payed game and i got so upset that i didn't pass day one. So yes im og 👏
Lol a jumpscare in 3 AM
matpat i think that the fifth kid is the crying child beacouse he resembels him with the striped shirt
Next thing you know blumhouse changes the kid back to g Freddy because mat[at guessed there twist
Your so rude mat pat faz goo is bad like what the heck
Even film theory can’t escape fnaf😂
Little bros instagram was used as a source twice lol
Bruv gonna brainstorm a fnaf game when it hasn’t been teased
I thought Mike/ guard from games was Aston’s son? They casted mikes dad who I thought would of been the actor for spring trap
If the movie gets delayed we know why
I think the 5th kid is the crying child from the bite of 87 (sorry I’m new to fnaf so that might be the wrong year, is it the bite of 83?)
nah bc he should be one of the actors in the fnaf movie
Theory: Why would the producers use a ball pit for a poster, I wonder?
It's very rare anything game wise says anything about my home state Nebraska
The only thing i don't like about this film is that animatronics don behave like they should, more like a person just wearing the costumes.
did bro pre order and get early access
the 5th kid is the crying kid
Lets just accept its just to Cash in and not get hopes
i cant watch the movie without willam saying I ALWAYS COME BACK..
I didn't even jump matpat scared me with that png jumpscare😭
It feel so amazing now that i get to see a fnaf video on film theory. God the nostalgia from this whole series finally being shown on the big screen makes me so incredibly happy. I’d love to say thank you Matpat and team for being a huge part of my life and bringing me so much joy with your videos. I am so ready for this movie and I’m so happy that we can all finally see it.
BLUD, the movie ain't even out yet 😭
My theory for the Nebraska poster is that's where his parents live, probably on some farm in the middle of nowhere, then he got a full ride to a community college in Utah and now is stuck there. The poster is a callback to his childhood.
The book is it a book
That thing is a Freddy suit filled with saws and stuff
15:25 please someone tell me how afton stuffed a kid in a cupcake😭
Hey guys I just texted the FNAF number and applied I got the job pray for me
If you reverse the scene when the kids are running it says afton killed me
👍
But what about THE ONE YOU SHOULDNT HAVE KILLED!?!?!?!?
If matpat doesn't get a suprise cameo in the movie, Im officially calling it uncanon
"Now all we need is a FNAF fashion line-"  Springlock Suits: "Am I a joke to you?"
Hear me out alright at the point of the video where mat is explaining how spring trap is clean and shiny ITS BECAUSE again hear me out the movie takes place before the games its the only thing that would make sense how would he be so clean in the movie its because he hasnt decayed in his suit yet
Yes matpat, reminet
GT: why is this series’s so dam hard FT: 🗿
Drink the green with envy for the fnaf cook to learn more lore
In this fnaf Mike Schmidt won’t be Michael Aston like usual
I had seen Steve Raglan as an anagram for everlasting but its actually everlastang and I don't know if this was a troll or not
It didn’t even come out yet:/
Does anyone else suspect the golden Freddy with Abby is Mike after he dies?
What if that fifth kid is a hint to the bite of 87? He is wearing a striped shirt
The cupcake has a brown wrapping to make the brown shirt kid.
I am at the start of this video.. still not sure if I am gonna continue or not.. cuz of possible spoiler if mat finally gets theory right EDIT: I am half way thru and I am hyped more than ever
They moved it to Nebraska because nothing else happens there so no one knows if the story is real or not
THATS JUST A THEORY A GAME THEORY THANKS FOR WALKING and wear your seatbelt...
👍
Do fanf 5 now its so interesting
Super movie
i'mma watch this after i watch the movie, because istg he might legitimately spoil everything.
This theory will be just as right as his Mario Movie theory.💀
Please trigger warning for spoilers :\
Petition to say “Was that the bite of ‘87?!?” in the theaters when a kid gets eaten 👇
You may have solved the movie, but I’ve solved all of Fnaf, I know everything, I can say, I’m the only person who has actually solved Fnaf
The device at the start was the scup
i just wasn't recommended fnaf until now
It’s insane to see a fnaf video finally on film theory of all things.
MatPat my dude… Kid in the Brown is Freddy and kid in the Yellow with the hat is Golden Freddy. At least I think. The cupcake is definitely a stretch.
Film theory: Special video, MatPat lore.
Bro this comes out on my birthday
Oh no its infected them all!
I think that Abby is a nickname for Elizabeth so that would line up
The movie didnt even come out yet lol
I love google meeet I use it all the time to call my friends
how tf did you get goole meet to sponsor you
Who else thinks that the guy getting stuffed in the freddy suit is phone guy
Can't wait for this theory to be shattered when the movie comes out.
MatPat: The only person to solve a movie before it even comes out.
ABBY IS CASSIDY
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS ON BOTH CHANNELS
the springlock scene is going to be crazy for new fans and amazing for of
Vegans getting angry its a google meet not a google vegetable
Dang that's craze oh yah I forgot because they were kids when killed  by a adult they don't like adults and love kids
Bruh Mike is aftons son
film theory idea: how long would the the bad guys ACTUALLY be in jail/what are the fines they would have to pay or any other punishment they'd have to endure?
The fith kid is the crying child
MATPAT LOOK AT THE 5TH KIDS CLOTHES
He has that Strips on his Shirt maybe he is the crying child ? That springtrap thing with the crying mask ?
Me personally as an og, it's painful with the new fans... I mean I'm grateful and happy you joined and all but please- listen to the og 😭
Matpat couldn't wait until the fnaf movie
i absolutely love El Chip
I think you got it wrong with the identities of the kids. The kid wearing all brown is definitely freddy, and the kid wearing yellow with a top hat is definitely golden freddy
"Discord has left the chat" anyways REMNANT
Should we name the crying child (officially) Garrett? It sounds British enough to be part of Afton’s Family. William, Michael, Elizabeth and Garrett.   Garrett Afton, the crying child.
Nice
It’s crazy that Michael Afton is not the main character
I hope that lf a second movie comes out they have the to6 animatronics and the withered ones
I was starting to think Matt was in the movie because he wasn't saying anything about it until now
You know they're trying to put all the movies together that might be might be the puppet 16:00
I accidentally Disliked 😱
Mike Schmidt more like Michael Afton
Game theory is my FAVORITE channel
for some reason when i watched the first trailer I thought Mike was gonna die and end up in the golden freddy suit I like this theory better tho 10/10 will shout remnant
Who loves Fnaf?
bro solved a movie that didn't even come out yet
Bro it's not even out yet, just chill
When the movie and cook book come out and hopefully a new fnaf game soon we can expect a fnaf weekend across four channels unless we get 3 of them and not 4 but here the basics 1. For the movie 2. For the cookbook And 3. For a explains of the costumes to how it works I really am looking forward to this if it happens
Well if the movie gets delayed Blame MatPat!
2:34 why isnt it just like a scooper from sister location
I'm kinda UPSET it doesn't go ALL the way on the actual lore of FNAF BUT I do like that they keep it close as possible because I thought Mike Schmidt was suppose to be Mike AFTON in the games using a different name. and His brother was Evan also if Matthew is supposed to be Afton this movie should take place before the spring lock is triggered on him and I'm assuming abby is supposed to be like Elizabeth? I am still very excited to see this movie and I love your theories this one is chef kiss I've watched yours, hyperdroids and wendigoons on the FNAF games and books; however i'm WONDERING if they will go into Aftons kids at all or are we assuming in this movie he doesn't have kids cuz the 3 kids that are his kids in games Mike Schmidt(Afton) Garret who would be Evan and Abiggail who im thinking would be Elizabeth but they didnt make any ties to them to William in the movies? and if thats so WHY DOES WILLIAM START KILLING KIDS IN THE MOVIE cuz I know his Main down fall was when Elizabeth is killed by Circus baby and Evan is killed because Michael didn't know spring locks trigger with wet. I know this is all just theory but the game does prove that william does have 3 kids AND I w onder if ANY of the movies will show Henry or Charloette(Charlie)??? I'm so invested in these things, so I'm excited to see what they do with all the movies
Garett would look super weird if he was crying child ,
Alo marvels morbius movie was bad because it miss many scenes,also jurassic world dominion was bad because it skip also some scenes like the dinosaur on the wave 🌊 and other stuff,hope fnaf movie goes good
Mat are you good.
A wast the youngest og fan because i became a fan since firstband second grade,altho now im barely teen
Look at the color scheme
"Do you think it will have a happy ending?" I am not certain it will have an ending
We finally got a name for the crying child is garrett
i think that either thats his lil brother or the crying child; bc of the striped shirt !
Before I watch this video and I've already seen the movie trailer, I have a question for everyone....        Do you guys think the Freddy Fazbear suit with the blades....  Michael, often when she was killing children, she never killed the children and brutal manners. He only did that one time, and that was with the kid that he shouldn't have killed that kid was killed in the most brutal manner head smashed in and everything, but it was too gruesome and he regretted it.    And after he took over the business of his partner, I doubt he would have made the suits that gruesome.      I don't know, though I'm not Scott Cawthon, I didn't create the game it's all up to him so yeah
been watching you for a long time and my birthday is the day after the movie comes out but anyway im glad you can finaley watch the movie
“There are ghost children possessing giant robots? Thanks for the heads up.” - this needs to be removed from the movie
The fifth kid looks like crying child since hes wearing a striped T-shirt
It definitely seems like the Cupcake is the last kid bc the posters have really been honing in on the Cupcake being “part of the roster”, almost as if it’s an independent character. I love the golden Freddy theory here, I was thinking the exact same thing! It would be a cool twist to see Abby get taken in the end and move into the  sequel as a “villain character”, I’m excited to see how this theory pans out!
There’s a theory that Matthew lillards character Steve raglan is just a alter ego that aftons going under to avoid the police and keep kidnapping kids
You never actually explained fazgoo in this theory- 😂
8 whole year of waiting I not happy because I know that fnaf movie will be Scott cawthon finale project and I enjoyed every last minuted of fnaf and yeah that why I’m not happy
You will never solve this franchise
MatPat better make a food theory about FNAF using the cookbook and a style theory about FNAF too. A FNAF four-way crossover *has* to happen someday.
Day 2 of asking MatPat to make a theory determining if the Nightmare Before Christmas is a Halloween or Christmas movie
At 15:05, about the identity of the last kid mentioned,  he is wearing a shirt with stripes.
DEY PU DA PEETA IN DA FNF
That kid has stripped shirt that puppet has stripe body
I can’t believe the fanf movie is coming out on my birthday!?
If we dont get a live action spring lock scene im going to be sad 😂
The kid with no characteristics does have one the shirt is striped so he might be the crying child
Steve Raglan is a scramble of everlastang (everlasting) being based off of willaims line, i always come back
The kid could be puppet (I really want puppet to be in the movie and I’m reaching for anything)
Hey matpat didn’t you make a FNaF timeline on your main
Dang matpat
This is just going to be the first one of 5 movies let’s say that and this series will go for longer then he thinks
I’m thinkin Abby becomes balloon boy just because of the “hello” if not that then marionette. I think it’s to early for Baby
The kids you said you didn’t know who he was is wearing a stripe shirt he might be the puppet
My THEORY about that weird REMMMMMMMNAT machine is that it is either a type of mimic, a remnant machine, or a type of circus baby animatronic!
16:00 souls can ➗thInk of golden Freddy and the puppet
Crying child? He has a striped shirt 15:19
Wait matpat I have a question, you know the sliver eyes graphic novel, in the movie it shows it’s a button that turns the animatronics on and turns them moving then what happened to the panel under the stage that moved the animatronics in the novel?
The most unrealistic part of this whole movie is someone actively trying to get into Nebraska ( its not a real place )
SPOILERS ALERT
Ain’t no way the movie hasn’t even came out yet and buddy already be solving all the lore.
this is way out there for no real reason. ill look back on your lore but if golden Freddy was in use before the others in the fnaf time line (not in the movie if your not counting it as real lore for games) did Cassidy (or whoever is in golden Freddy's soul) die Mutch earlier than the other kids? ill look back on your lore after I finish this video =P
I love how he talked about how if they changed stuff from the game to the movies being confusing like fnaf is not confusing at all
There is already a fanf gummy pizza
19:11 bye timed viewers
My brother in Christ the movie hasn’t even come out yet
Fun theory: Afton is still Michael’s father. What if Michael and Garrett were both kids of William but their mother split from him when they were too young to remember? Knowing what kind of monster William is, she quickly remarried and had her new husband raise them as his own with no knowledge of their true parentage. Garrett gets bit but Mike represses the memory, instead remembering it as a disappearance rather than an accident by his own hands. In one trailer, we see what looks to be the mother’s feet from behind a coffee table. I think the mother takes her own life at some point. Either after what happens to Garrett or during the week of current day. But this would leave Abby in Mike’s custody. This theory would also make Abby Mike’s half sister, which would make sense given the big age gap between the two. I have more theories along this line so let me know if I should add anything to this comment later.
mat i think i know who the fivith child is: The Crying Child from FNAF4 same striped shirt same jeans same look , vibe and experssion
MatPat ending a kid's career for making an instagram comment XD
Something I realized in the cast you know mikes little bro I was looking through and mikes kidnapped bro is called :ghost kid #5
Matpat about to make a 10 hour video reacting to the movie and analyzing it
Matt you don't get it who that kid with a stripe sure to use said was the cupcake it's actually Evan striped shirts have his face down like he's always sad Evan Afton also known as The crying child
They should do an episode of Film Theory about how MatPat is secretly a cult leader & we are his followers
I mean the 5th kid is wearing a striped shirt.. like the crying child
BRO ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET
MatPat I think you’re right about the Nebraska whole thing because I think it’s just a poster of the state that he lived in when he was a child
I don't know if anyone asked that question but... why the heck does Golden Freddy move? Isn't he supposed to not have endoskeleton like in FNAF 1 and 2? I meeean... Looking at the fact that this movie tries to keep everything tied to the story, then maybe we will get an answer on when, why and how did Golden Freddy lose his endoskeleton?
Can’t wait to see Matpat trying to whip up a fazbear pizza on food theory
Or also the freddy head with saws could've just been a nightmare, that's also a possibility.
Cineworld said this with regards to age If it is a PG13 then yes, with parental consent but I believe the new fnaf film will be a 15. They would not be able to watch this
i defo think that this takes place right before fnaf 3 but other than thag i agree w everything!!
honestly never thought we would actually be getting this movie so awesome that its finally here
That’s a 2000-2002 accord that they drive, 1998-2000 has a different front bumper
I hate that Matpat makes me seem like a total idiot😭 l love it❤
Baby scooping Abby is for sure gonna give me a jump scare just like my first time in the game
I’m convinced MatPat is psychic
11:05
Alrogut, my theory: the machine is a test spring-lock suit that went wrong made by Afton. He used it for his sick thoughts and it's been turned into a Remnant Extractor once Afton discovered what it was. If this is wrong, please correct me but I have been here since the first FNaF theory.
ALREADY?! MATPAT, CALM DOWN!!
he always comes back
The 5th kid (who u said was cupcake) is probobly the crying child. (Bc he is NOT wearing a fnaf head/mask, rhat shows that hes different, that he is SCARED of them. The only one like that is the crying child.
13:57 why do we trust that vanessa knows the Animatronics motivation?
I have a theory that the fifth kid isn’t the cupcake, he becomes the puppet because of his shirt but other than that there is no evidence
If the springlock death scene doesn't happen in this movie, I will literally cry
My prediction: this movie is going to get a 3.4 rating hahahha
Make a Fiona and cake Theory
fifth kid has the same outfit as the crying child.
Seeing william walking with kids in a yellow rabbit costume would be so disturbing I wanna see it 😭 Id also enjoy if this movie didnt end well.   Also the kid with no characteristic has grey stripes like crying child (to me)
Crying child????
I hope they plan to take the movies slow and make more movies to give the story as much detail as it needs.   If it goes too fast, FNAF stans will be upset and people just watching for the first time won’t get any of it if they try to cram so much into 2 hours.  Edit: I also hope they don’t water down all the brutal stuff. Is it gross? Sure but that’s the point
mat pat hazbin hotel is coming to amazon sometime in january
They should of gave him a cameo for all the work he did on this franchise
Knowing movies, Matpat will be wrong and the fnaf movie will have a happy ending with everyone smiling of joy of almost being murdered by animatronic robots
Nah the middle kid should be the puppet he's got stipes on his shirt like the puppet
Did you see the Fnaf movie with the phone number try to do it in the next video
How did you miss this matpat where did egg man come from please matpat make a video on this please 😅
Hi:) ...Read more
Day 5 of asking for a theory on Splatoon
I have been waiting almost a decade for this to go to film theory, this better be worth it.
I still think the cupcake is Chica's dog Afton killed to lure her in. That scene has big "sic him, boy!" energy. I like the thought that the striped shirt kid could be the Puppet. Also still think "They want to make her like them" could be a misdirect saying the ghost kids want Abby to be friends with them or Abby is already dead and they want to bring her back. I just have no idea what suit they would have for her. So many fun possibilities! Can't wait to see it.
I love that you have mandatory fun nights. My team has a weekly mandatory appointment on Fridays called "What's Up - Extreme Friday Edition". It starts at 2pm and goes to 3pm, which coincides with the earliest time at which you can clock out for the weekend. What do we do in said meeting? We play board games. Werewolf, Concept, Happy Salmon, Codenames and stuff like that. I even managed to convince my director to buy us an additional storage unit for games by reasoning that this was a regular team bonding event. It helps that my team consists of massive nerds who are super happy to try out weird board games or TTRPGs on the fly. :3
if abby is an acronym for baby doesnt that mean that she is based on elizabeth wich would be logical if mike is michael golden freddy is evan and the father is william
What about puppet
Bro why is golden Freddy standing
We also use Google meet for class
I know we all want a fnaf chuck e cheese, scott cawfin refused to do so out if a worry that someone is gonna recreate the events of the game.
At the start when he said oh my Stars.  It was so funny I just can't help it😂
OCTOBER FIRST EVERYONE 🎉🎉🎉
Googles meet💀
I think Mike will be golden freddy, thats why she was friends with him
hii
I'm so excited for this movie Ohmygod
If I am correct then the spring Bonnie suit is not spring-locked at the scenes in the trailers because he was fine when Mike was offered the job so that is very unlikely. If you look you will see that the right side of his suit is rotting but what if it is because half of it was safe but the other was open to the elements. Also if you think about it if we follow MatPats theory then maybe the animatronics spring-lock him at the end and while he’s in pain and rotting they trap him in the walls. Thanks for reading all this because it’s pretty long😊😊😊
who wants to go to nebraska
THE MOVIE!!!!
Did you guys see the new trailer with spring trap????
15:14 I am pretty sure would be cupcake considering his shirt has the same lining as the bottom of a cupcakes lining
(Film Theory) Hey they're releasing a Fnaf movie! So there's going to be more Fnaf theories for us to solve! (The Other Channels) YOU IDIOT! YOU'VE DOOMED US ALL!
google meet is the most random sponsor i have seen
How much do you wanna bet he figured out the entire plot before it even comes out??
Oh boy
I don’t know much about the fang lore but what if the 5th kid is the marionette?
Does anyone remember when matpat was in the fnaf musical? He broke through a false wall at the end. Im not sure if i put a link my comment will get flagged but if you look it up and rewatch the whole thing he's there, along with markaplier who was the night guard
Nahhh💀 bro used the pit Time Machine lore 13:39
Ok, so as far as the fifth kid being the cupcake goes, I actually have a pretty good idea for why he’d be golden Freddy. Look at the shirt he’s wearing. It’s striped, just like Evan’s/the crying child’s. And we know the crying child goes on to possess golden Freddy. So that could be a little far of a stretch for the movie BUT it’s a pretty solid guess and it’d be a cool reference for the hardcore fans.
WHY IS BONNIE BLUE HE IS PURPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You can’t solve a movie that hasn’t come out yet!
I don't know how it is scary it is not scary plus I love fnaf I'm a huge fan who ever thinks it is scary who and how
hes done it hes solved it the prophice is TRUEEE
Me thinking that matpat is gonna say the 5th kid is the puppet:  Matpat:*says its the cupcake*  Me:well that didnt make sense
The movie did got delayed, but from what I read Scott did a rewrite. Idk why but I don’t want that plot
The fnaf movies....much like its licenses will never end.
I honestly think that Afton  will die CuS they burnt down the place
Bro really figured out an unreleased movie
Are you having a  camo in the fnaf movie matpat
Some yt shorts gut said he's wrong 😭
well actually the cook book was at my book fair
Ruined, broken nothing left I will fix it
the younger child steals everything from the ooldest, Game theory had it all, then film, then food, then style
I think the fifth kid is the puppet he's wearing a stripped shirt
Matpat! Theres a shorts ARG that I cant solve AT ALL. Its by QAndy...we need your help
What about Charlie? Where is she going to fit into all of this?
So sad we won’t get to see Afton get Spring locked :/ it’s honestly one of my favorite parts of the series because of how disturbing it is
I like eating poop
utahns in this vid 👇
I would like to see a style theory on how they got the mask to register as freddy while its on a humans face
I swear to god if they change what happens in thw Movie because matpat Solved it in im going crazy…
He broke in the pizzaria again.
We all started singing the living tombstone song when at the beginning right
11:45
11:40
I need an end credit scene where MatPat is a detective looking at the pizzeria, and someone asks “so, you have any idea what happened?” And he says “I have a theory…”
👍
0:20 there goes my ear 🙃
Fun fact: the fnaf series has been alive for a decade
Awesome
Bro just solved 10 years of lore 💀💀💀
Scott: Fans gonna love it Also Scott: MatPat's gonna hate it
Fifth kid has golden hair
Bro the movie isn’t even out
15:47 HORCRUX?
You must keep in mind that the 5th child had a stripped shirt. Maybe this is a referance to Crying Child?
Film Theory’s First Fnaf episode! (Kind of…)
My theory is that this “Steve Raglan” changed his identity from William Afton to Steve Raglan
Lolololololololololol why is it coming out on my birthday
how
I searched up FNAFgoogle earths and I got a map of Nebraska 🤐 or something like Nebraska Scooter mall🤐
0:19 Did I just get jump scared by mat pat!?!
Matpat said, "When the sequel comes out," but I don't think there will be anything Scott makes after the movie, not even a sequel, but hey, I could be wrong
As much as I like the part where trap Afton in the wall. I’d rather see him get springlocked in the suit and die and then come back as springtrap in the sequel
In vr the cupcake runs away and has never had a soul till now
Anyone else notice that crying kid and the 5th kid (the one without ties to the other anamatronics) are wearing the same shirt?
Stop yapping matpad
why is the fifth kid not considered to be the puppet(just by judging his striped shirt) ?and just not shown maybe not even in the movie but the next I mean since it is a mix of all timelines it may make sense idk
No way MatPat is gonna solve ddlc 14 lore like 1727373 bajillion years before its release 🗿☠
When was the last time you took a shower. Go home mat. Go see your family. And for gods sake, STOP OBSESSING OVER FNAF!
But in FNaF book  they said that they don't like the adults but when one of the kids was taken by fox they said that they were protecting the kid.
I really want to see William have his spring locks activate while he’s in the suit and I want to see a live action interpretation to his comeuppance from FNAF 3. That would make my day
The fifth kid has a striped shirt - can he not be the puppet?
93 episode inclucing gtlive
Here’s my theory I think that the soul of the fifth child is actually in the suit of the puppet master.
Bro solved it before it came out.
Is it just me or is the trailers for this movie just not scary in the slightest
The 5th kid IS golden freddy, the reason why he isn't the cupcake is because we see him move around independently in fnaf 4 and VR
the stripes on the 5th child's sweater remind me of the puppet
Your Wildin for 35$ socks
That fifth kid is wearing a striped short. He's clearly the Crying Child.
Google meet sponsored a video about the Fnaf movie was the last thing anyone expected
it isn't a theorist channel without matpat trying to claim he solved fnaf next on food theory: we solved the fnaf cookbook
hes in it ive read the script
I have a feeling after the bite of 83 the Aftons couldn’t take care of Mike anymore knowing that he killed his brother, so they put them up for adoption and that’s why we see William is not Michael’s father
Those who didn't flinch at the start 👇
If I don’t hear “I always come back” at the end of this movie I’m suing
MATPAT THE EXTRA KIDS SHIRT IS CUPCAKES WRAPPER DUHHH
Hey matpat can you do a theory vid on the new gooseworx and glitch productions new series coming soon “The Amazing Digital Circus”?
At 15:07 with the kid with the striped shirt I would say it could be the puppet cause of the stripes on his shirt and his sleeves, but it could just be a coincidence.
already bought the cook book 🙃
Har har har har har
Do a four way Fnaf Theory
im going to see it
If the line "I always come back " I will scream
Mat Pat  I love your vids ,I suggest you do a theory on "The Closing Shift". (I mean really don't have to, you can do it when you have time..)  I await you response... (Yours truly Raiden)
Bro spoiled the movie before it even came out
Why do I suddenly feel more hyped for this fnaf theory than all the other fnaf theories?? 🤣 I should feel used to it by now lol Maybe it's cause it's on film theory idk.
What about the puppet
What if the cupcake is actually her dog? In previous theories the child that possessed chica was lured away and killed by using her dog. If the cupcake can't talk and can only attack that would explain being unable to hide a body in a cupcake. And the 5th child in the trailer looks alot like crying child or the puppet. Perhaps he's just unable to move on until the others are put to rest?
There are times that Matpat is spot on and it's awesome. I hope this is one of those times
I'm pretty sure Steve raglan is just a fake name just like Dave Miller was in silver eyes
Matt the fifth kid has a striped shirt there is only one kid in the franchise that has that shirt
Bro figured out the lore before the movie eveb released.
lol... google meet is the perfect sponsor for this video, for my family: when they were younger, my kids rounded up all our devices with whatever the previous google-video-call app was, set them up as security cameras throughout the house, and played their own live-action version of FNAF.  Mom and I looked at each other with smiles of approval.
Bro is that Freddy Fazballs from Five nights at Fortnite 😱😱
the with noting is crying kid with his striped shirt
i think that only gold Fredy is friends with aby. by the way keep up the good content
This might be a stretch but what if the kid is the crying child Evan but since it’s two kids inside golden Freddy and then Cassidy is just protecting Abby idk sorry if this doesn’t make sense
Great work bro. Just go ahead. Lot's of love to you from India.
We know 100% Mathew plays William because he literally said it himself that he was playing him on a live stream or something like rhat
I sincerely love that the FNAF franchise's story has been so tremendously lacking in forethought at every step on the road that the goal has shifted from hunting for a single cohesive narrative to attempting to assemble the definition that fits the most possible pieces in place. It's been an absolute blast regardless!!
Your scripting is usually so flawless
True fact: I bought some LEGO Five Nights at Freddy’s (obviously fake) on aliexpress the other day and they apparently ship on October 26th, the FNaF movie release date for Australia (where I live) What a coincidence! 🗿
i wonder if they are going to carry though with ennard michael situation i mean i assume mike isn’t an afton but will it change ennard entering mikes innards
Slightly different take, I think Mike becomes Golden Freddy. You never see them both in the same scene and Abby is awful trusting of one animatronic when she hides from the others.
FNAF is reminding me of spongbob more and more. Keep the characters, get rid of stories and consequences.
Been watching FNAF game theories since childhood, man I cannot wait to see how well this theory ages
never expected seeing fnaf on film theory.
Am i the only one that saw the Sanshee plushies and the rubx costume mask on the prize counter
DO YOU KNOW HOW COOL IT WOULD BE TO SEE “ABBY” GET SCOOPED UP BY BABY?!???
What id like to know is if matpat knew what he was getting into with the fnaf musical, given that it’s not lore accurate.
No you didnt.
day 4 of asking for a film theory on iron mans iq
“My best guess, and again, this one’s a guess-“ *casually figures out the torcher freddy within 3 minutes of a video*
i think the kid is garrett and he’s in with afton’s victims bc he’s one of aftons victims, not bc he’s part of the freddy gang
Springtrap: HAHA! I finally get reborn  to- Matpat: WELCOME TO GAME THEORY! Springtrap: Oh no not AGAIN Matpat: [insert matpat noises] Springtrap: I want to die...
I wanna see matpat do a d&d campaign
I have never played a horrer game yet I rarely jumped at jumpscares also does anyone here know about that skit that markiplier and some other ppl did (including matpat also by other ppl i mean idk their names not just random ppl) that was a puppet remake of fnaf 1? a lot of what i just said could be wrong lol     night of the museum but based off a game?
No way he pulled out the instagram comments, that is crazy dedication
I feel like Abby dying at the end would not be in a pg13 movie
The one that u thaught was the cupcake
You can always count on matpat to figure out ❤
The kid had a striped shirt. 😏😏😏
I love the talent Matpat has to make a whole argument about a trailer and a few teasers and show it as a theory, he just explains what happens each second of the trailer... a few "Maybes" and "perhaps" thats a theory?, man you certainly have lost your touch... Im still a loyal fan, but seriously too much of something is bad... You wanna be there at the finish line before anyone else and people follow your lead thinking its a good lead, but you are just circling the same road again and again, like the Nebraska poster, "YOU FOUND A NEW CLUE" people say, yet all you did was pointing it out saying "pehaps it means something" like seriously?,  I still follow you and I think you are a great guy but this FNAF thing has been milked for far too long in my opinion..
Only matpats gets google meet to sponsor him
schnawg it's not even out yet
So i was away from my fone when  you were talking about Google meat. And i thought  for most of it it was googles new food delivery  system like factor ect.
So my question  is who did they secretly cast markiplier  as....
What if mike got springlocked not William
You know, the kid in the hat could be the main character’s brother and he is the crying child
do bfbi lore pls😢
There better be Freddy spaghetti in the cook book
Imagine if they make that ice cream place from the first batch of teasers into a real ice cream place to promote the movie in Utah so is the crying child finally have a name
what if mike aftons mom broke up with will and maried some guy with the last name schmidt but it is just a theory.
Ok
It baffles me that this much research into an indie game/books was done by a grown man in his 30s LOL. Most people your age are worrying about feeding their families.
1 month before release already? Wow, time sure does fly
2nd movie trailer intro should be Springtrap punching through a wall, like crawling out and then it pans to his face and eyes and it says “I ALWAYS COME BACK”
That one kid without a animatronic or whatever, the shirt reminds me of the puppet
But you have to remember Baby splits in half and eat her victim soo may be that happens to Abby aka Elisabeth
Wait, is Abby Elizabeth?
Bro got the script early
Or the kid could have been puppet. Since yk the shirt.
Ok here me out, I also thought he was the cupcake but doesn’t he kind of look like the marionette
Game Theory Related: I think Mat should cover the game: Lies of P
Haha sucks to b u I get Fnaf a day earlier bahaha
William is using a pen name (a fake name)
random thought, doesn’t it make more sense that the twist would be the major character that has been omitted in EVERY trailer. striped shirt… not the cupcake, but the marionette. why would scott omit one of the biggest and most important characters of the entire franchise.
Egg
Fnaf cookbook
This movie is gonna be so bad if they just blend 10 years worth of fnaf content together. Rather make a longer franchise that focuses more closely, but not too closely, on the actual story
at 3:50 in the back theres a goomba
Bro couldn’t even wait until the movie came out…
ok guys we don’t need to watch the movie he figured it out
Wow
Indeed
I might have a theory of my own regarding William Afton’s operations avoiding a criminal record beyond the MCIs that tie into potential events in the film. Possibly.
Matpat, theres a bioshock movie coming out, in 2025, so, theres another thing taken for film theory
Nice
At first i was kinda upset that the movie was going to be a different lore than we know, but now im excited. I sometimes forget most of the lore is still theorisation and not actually canon ☠️
Bro made a theory on a movie that hasn't even come out yet💀
icl i feel like mathew llilards playing phone guy and not willy billy afton
Soon it will speed to food theory to and they wildest have Fnaf clothes so style theory should be making some Fnaf style theoty's
“Mikes dad” could b an adoptive parent
Man I can’t wait for the movie to release
Maybe one day Scott will one day give us a timeline...... HA! In seriousness he might never and it's fun since it allows everyone to make Theory's.
Grant Gregory
The kid that you thought that was the cupcake. Don't you think that the kid is the crying child. Like all the kids there are dead and the crying child is dead so I think its the crying child.😊
I just want the acting to be good
LOOORE!
A kid in my class is playing bollon boy
so i asked my mom kinda jokingly as i know the answer but she shrug and said i dont know the answer is simple she doesnt do video games much she used to game back in the pac man era ... aka before u were born mat! and she only watches 3 or 7 depending how u wanna see it, channels and 1 catagory (harry potter)  and yes you are one of the channels she watch i group all the film theory as one btw thats why i said 3 or 7 she watches any but least of the game. theory.
Hear me out guys: I think the cupcake is posessed by Susie’s dog, yes I know the games are different than the movie but think about it, the cupcake was biting the person and attacking almost like a dog, AND Susie’s dog literally was killed and or ran over by Afton in the games, just a thought,
The animatronics I want to see live action is the nightmare animatronics and the withered animatronics some of my favorites
Wow, this man, I mean he's great but, some times he scars me
Scott Changing The Script As Fast As He Can To Fail Matt's Theory
He might have it figured out because he figured out the plot of Ruin before it came out so who knows
This video has made me lose hope in mat pat fnaf theories due too Mat pat saying the cupcake is possessed. I can excuse him switching up Springtrap and springbonnnies names but not the cupcake being possessed.
scott: Oh no...he figured it out! TIME TO PUSH IT BACK, WE ARE REMAKING IT.
That extra kid could be the puppet and not the cupcake? His shirt kinda resembles the colours of the puppet?
I’d really love to see Afton closing in on Venessa and Mike, but Abby and the animatronics come up and Freddy or something fights him off as Mike runs to Abby. And the animatronics cause the spring locks to be set off, that would be sick
I love how fnaf after all these years still has a special place in old fans hearts, i have been playing since the release, i was 7/8 and now im 16. And finally my dream film is coming, a film that is a summary of my fav lore and horror game, a game i loved as a child and i love as a teen.
Is it just me or does the kid in the blue pants and lined shirt look like the crying child??
What if? Abby will not survive the movie and gets stuffed into the puppet and sets up the Second movie?
If she does become baby, there’s no doubt we will see, ennard in the second film and maybe a small scene of springtrap near the end
I believe this movie might explain why Vanessa is connect and that’s why at some point she’s wearing a yellow shirt her sister might be chicks spirit and that’s why she knows so much about the pizzeria and that’s how she got connected to fnaf and then she got possessed by glitch trap in security breach
I actaully was able to meet Lillard a fan x the other day, he's really, well....purple guy-y
There’s spring trap in the drawings
🫱                  🎤
Make an ena theory
do a second video on boisvert theres a lot more videos
That's what I was thinkkng about Karl The Cupcake!
YOU FR JUST SUMMARIESED A MOVIE THAT ISN'T OUT UNTIL NEXT MONTH 😭😭
HEY YOU YEAH YOU DO A FILM THEORY ON CENTAUR WORLD  XDDDD
Fiona and cake?
Bro fr solved the movie before it even came out 😭😭
Sitting here and asking matpat to tell us about the loops in the Qdandy shorts
Why don’t you do a theory about the welsh dragon
Sheesh
Imagine the movie is the actual lore of the game 😭
This might sound dumb but I always thought the fifth kid was the Marionette because of the stripey shirt
2 questions first do you have instructions for the lego game theory logo? and second can you make a game theory on apex legends there's a  lot of lore in the game and it could be quite a nice video.
I think the second movie would either be a prequel in the form of the fnaf 2 game and then the third movie being fnaf 3 where we see the return of movie springtrap
I think everyone knew Lillard was sneaky purple guy, but great catch finding the evidence before the movie comes out.
MatPat this is the seventh time you've shown fnaf in class
I thought golden freddy had two souls, isnt that still a possibility?
I feel like the one thing that will make me hate this film is if MatPat and Markaplier don't somehow have a camo in the film 😢
Yet who is this "female villain" mentioned in casting? Mrs. Afton?
Ik people skip the add about google meet but I actually enjoy it cuz I use it and I have iPhone 😅
Hiiii! Can you pls do a thery abt a movie called when the wind blows, there's also a book and I just wanna see a thery :'D
matpat just wanted to let u know i have a fnaf top so after the cookbook comes out it'l not be safe i will send u a picture if i figure out how to on pc   btw luv ur vids
18:01 It’s time for your final BOW
The packaging is just so amazing!
The character without the resemblance of a FNAF animatronic, but he has a stripped shirt which reminds me of the crying child
The fifth child is the crying child
I feel this is just gonna be out of order in timeline just as the games were a bit
Please please please Dexter Lab theoryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy=yyyyyyyyyyyy🎉🎉🎉🎉
Day two of asking for I Can't Sleep
Mat should make a SCP
i bet the big twist is that Abby is chica's cupcake. no one tell edp
For someone who has been in the lore for 6years this is the movie I’m seeing but this man just told the movie without it coming out that’s how good he is so keep the good work up bro your the best
you should make a video on emesis blue either a film theory or gt live i feel like a gt live would be better but its your pick its also another IP taken from game theorys toybox for film theory
Bro why does he keep hopping on the Instagram 😭
I will say i am an a OG and i cant wait for the movie
You want the big twist at the end?? SSdtIG5vdCBpbiBpdCDwn5iU
2:36 I think its someone being stuffed in a Freddy mask
Bruh, the movie hasn't even come out yet but blud is still theorising
Film theory make a video about the new backrooms videos
please do a theroy on total drama island there a lot of lore in the series
Ohhh did u miss the hot topic fnaf accessories ??? 😂
make a theory on @TheSunVanished
The kid in the picture he looks like the crying child just look at his clothes striped shirt and jeans he is not the cupcake
The movie ends in a cliff hanger.
YOU NEED TO DO THE POLAR BEAR 2026 MEME
I thought that thingy was the scooper
Can you do Lego monkie kid?
Very good video
Do a rottmnt theory!!
It had a movie?
crazy idea for next fnaf whatever:
That fifth child has the same outfit as the crying child. Striped shirt and blue pants.
He’s in the walls… HES IN THE GOD DAM WALLS!!!
Hey Mat I’m concerned that the movie will happen just like how it happened in the FNAF games however with FNAF 1 its more unsettling because well all 5 Animatronics were the causes of the kids deaths and I heard this theory about Chucky Cheese that he bit a child’s head off in the pizzeria the same thing that happened in FNAF 4 with the crying child who’s name is unknown which said that on google but that Golden Freddy did bit that kids head off however I don’t know if this Chucky cheese theory is true or not.
the movie isnt even out yet and he already finished it
Intentional avoidance i bet, though they probably wouldn't watch you
Film theory finally gets a FNAF video
The other kid being the cupcake is exactly what I thought, probably because I didn’t know what Golden Freddy was.
*Lore explained* videos have their own lore now.😮
Go team Android 10:42
1:25 the goat of multi category content
I just found this channel called nosleep666 and I think you should make a video
Welp that whole movie just got spoiled
Please do emisis blu
I think the 6th mystery kid is the puppet because he has no defining features other than his striped shirt similar to the the stripes on the puppet
Y'all future peeps tell us what happened
notice the purple devil emoji after that instagram post
I’m thinking the 5th kid has the be the puppet. He was the one responsible for putting the kids in the suits and acts like a leader to the animatronics.
15:16 look at his shirt... he could be puppet
So you say the cupcake is a soul and plead your case without mentioning the 5 things melted into one stories? The Fourth Closet shows Afton melting 5 animatronics into one being Freddy,Chica,Bonnie,Foxy, and a Cupcake on Chica's head. Has this info been brought up before cause I think the cupcake has a soul. Anyone who thinks of anything that can help prove this or otherwise please reply I feel like this is big info and someone with more knowledge should investigated.
Pls do vonharry family barr and grill
Bro really got google sponsoring him, Hes made it
FILM THEORY IDEA: ok you know the new Ariel movie?? can we all agree that Ariel was the sinking all the ships?! like when she sings she sinks the ships
The unknown kid with the cupcakes theory, would have figured that's the Puppet.
I think 5 kid is marionette
I believe the theory, but just imagine if Mike's brother Garrett was actually just taken to Nebraska
Who thinks mat should do a coraline theory 👇
The movie isn’t even OUT and MatPat still finds a way to figure it out!
What I'm asking myself is: will they movie be on actual 5 nights, as in Five Nights at Freddie's, or will it be like Security Breach, where it's only one night?
What if Matthew lillards character is just the movies version of William so it doesn’t matter his name
WE NEED FREDDY SPAGHETTI IN THE COOKBOOK
plot twist before spring bonnie get them he get spring locked
I won't be suprised if this man won't recreate the script bar for bar and line by line...
Matt Pat on YouTube it's okay with three on Violet night please.
🗿🙏🏻
Now we need to solve why you aren’t in it
15:30 last kid looks like crying child though
hey Matt, pat I’m Curtis Jeffries one of your biggest fans I have a friend name Bryant Powell, who is really good with series about other shows like Spider-Man into the spider verse and stuff like that I think it would be really cool if you could see if you could hire him as your assistant he would really like to make theories with you
Idea you take some of your subscribers like 1-10 to see the fnaf movie with you
Anyone else think that  the extra 5th kid looks a lot like the crying child? He's got the stripped shirt and everything.
3:36 We had that in the avatar movie. I think we all know how that ended.
Game theory I googled meat and I got… Meat
Hey, could u do a theory on the Recreyo glitches arg? I think it’s an arg, it could be something close to it but there’s lore in the channel and it’s happening right now so figure it out while u can
MATPAT I KNOW THAT ALL MIGHT WILL DIE IN MHA MANGA BECAUSE IN EP 33 OF S2 IT SAID ALL MIGHT WOULDN'T BE AROUND WHEN DEKU FIGHTS ALL FOR ONE PLS DO A THEORY ON IT ITS MY HERO ACADEMIA S2 EP33
What if the boy is Cassidy and the two are gonna posseing golden freddy and cassidy soon enough Garrett will win over golden Freddy and Cassidy is final set to rest
If he’s right I’m going to be both, very impressed and upset because he’d spoil the whole movie, plot twist and everything 😭😂
Hey just to let you know Tarkin from Star Wars is dumb just to get the elephant out of the room 1: he made the TIEs 2: he stayed on the Death Star during the battle of yavin 3: he fired the Death Star on a empire base killing many storm and shore troopers
Or the “cupcake” kid is the puppet bc of the stripes on their shirt
Matt....  The stripped shirt. The 5th kid is The Puppet.
Can you do a scary 3d teacher lore
No mention of the puppet at all?
Mike=Michael Garret=golden Freddy Abby=baby
How did i not realize it’s jose freaking hutcherson from the trailer?! Needed film theory to say it aloud. Now i’m super excited tho!!!
1 ticket for the FNAF movie please. 🗿🍷
if living in nebraska is better than whatever you bave going on, you have literally the worst life of anyone that has ever existed
Compared to Scott movie marketing is not secretive at all
Matpat the third kid has clothes similar to the clothes of the crying child
0:09 perfect oportunity to say it's been so long
What if instead of the other movie saving Abby would actually be in the new vr game, since it also takes place is sister location?
Congratulations matpat you most likely have now ruined the movie for us😂😂
wait is abby elizabeth?
Hey, can you pls do a film theory on Helluva Boss
SERIOUSLY. . . I HATE THE IDEA OF THIS MOVIE HAVING A DOWNER ENDING;  Especially when We're no Stranger to More Optimistic & Less Negative Endings in the Franchise; like The GOOD Ending of FNAF3, The GOOD Ending of Pizzeria Simulator; the CANON Golden Ending of Security Breach (Which is Proven By there NOT being a Drawing for the "Save Vanny" ending within Ruin like there is for EVERY OTHER Ending that game had; and the Princess Quest Arcade Machine being Impaled by a Golden Sword in AR Vision!)  TO HAVE THIS MOVIE END ON A SOUR NOTE LIKE THE ONE MATPAT IS PREDICTING; WOULD P*** OFF THE NEWER FANS LIKE ME!! WHO DIDN'T COME TO THE FRANCHISE TO SEE A DOWNER ENDING!!
I think the kid in the top hat is golden Freddy, he’s good obviously, and the other kid is where it brown ie Freddy classic
i choked on my drink at 17:13
Yeah so chicas neutral b is a command grab projectile thats a cupcake
Please take your medication fnaf is not real
I always thought FNAF was set in Colorado
The fifth kid is puppet
I’m just disappointed it wasn’t plushies take Manhattan💀
ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET 💀💀💀💀
I’m in hurricane Utah so I’m in Fnaf
I would be genuinely surprised if anyone expected a FNAF movie to have a happy ending
I have that freddy costume
hey matpat so here's one thing you should make a video about the new the new Nike movie about the like this dude from How to Train Your Dragon trying to trollthe out of alphamake a video about toothless cuz to flesh might be Alpha
It's been so long...
pls do a vid on the anime madoka magica (its not what it seems)
The fifth child was wearing a shirt with STRIPES who else has stripes  THE PUPPET also in fnaf 2 we saw the puppet in the fnaf 1 video and we know that fnaf 2 happened before fnaf 1 so there is a high chance that the puppet is the fifth kid
You should make a theory on shiloh and bros hint watch there first water fight video skip to among us video 1 then skip to number 2  Then continue through the videos the rest of their skits either, aren't lore important or their time of from working for the M.O.M. organization, I don't know which
can you do alea bale the SpongeBob guy
This kinda confirms Matt is definitely not in the movie... he wouldn't be explaining a movie he's in before it's released.
So... When is book therory coming out
Good video nice time
Calling it now. They have to burn the animatronics to free the childrens souls but burn freddies down in the process with afton in the springtrap suit. Or the animatronics also do help but get burned down in the huge finally.
Theory: you know the song mlku(the one thats going viral on the internet)? I think there's something dark adout it... I think she was once a very famous pop star, until everyone forgot her... and now she want our attention again... or something eles... something darker... dont know about you, but i smell an ARG! love your chanels by de wey!! Keep being THE BEST!!!!
The kid wearing Brown is freddy. The other kid with the top hat is Golden Freddy!
I think that the 5th kid at 15:21 is the crying child
MatPat please do a theory on nyoomion. It’s complicated with not much lore given but it is a pretty fun one. I’m already trying it out for myself incase you won’t so either way those people are getting a theory. Might not be a good one though. (It’s on YouTube btw)
My man made a theory video of a movie thats not even out yet☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️💀💀💀💀
it just surprised me in how faithful the animatronics designs are. it feels weird haha
Matt should do a walking dead theory on the new daryl Dixon spin off
Random thought that I don’t know the answer to: Is it possible to be able to find lore is something that doesn’t contain lore?   I feel like the answer would be no but I’m not entirely certain. I tend to analyze things intensely, but now I feel like there’s lore in a lot of things that might not be there.
Whats the difference between sponsoring a portion of the video and sponsoring the video?
he should make a combination channel of game theory and film theory for video game movies
10:00 ARE THOSE THE SLIDES OF 87?!
I feel like this film will be fine as long as it doesnt become the one with nic cage in it, a bit wierd and made for the laugh/ just because
dont mention fnaf fashion line or else scott will make it happer just to troll, like it was with the shark...
Film thery idea what about a coralline video
Around 15min in, what if it's the puppet? Stripe shirt matches the stripe design on puppet. Just a guess
Hey matpat I have film theory idea for you. I’ve been rewatching the classic old sitcom Frasier with my mom and I want to know if there’s actual scientific evidence on Niles Crane’s countless random allergies. Is it legit stuff or just made up stuff for jokes and running gags. Not sure if you’ll ever see this comment but if you do I am curious on your thoughts.
Man it ain’t even out yet
LORE!!!!!!!!!
good
Hear me out my theory is that the kid with no characteristics is actually the puppet because think about it if the movie is going to focus on different parts of the timeline it will be right to add the puppet due to them being a important figure in the series
An interesting animation 😀
Film theory: How does the karma from my name is earl work?
Hi can you do a thery on the tv seris gothom knghts.
Hey Matpat! Can you do a theory on Milgram an interactive music project on YouTube?
I believe the cupcake is Susie's dog because, it was crawling and was moving like a quadruped, and there are only 5 missing children, it would be weird if one was just forgotten, it only is a a dog who died which would still be sad but would be much sadder than death of a child/ the dog's death would be overlooked.
Check out Danny drawings and figure out clone right pls
Please do the lore of starset it has a story to it, it is a music video compilation
Can you make a video on Willy's Wonderland
Can you do a theory for Ninjago please? Thank you
If markiplier doesn't make a cameo in this movie I'm literally saying the movie sucked despite knowing I'm gonna love it
Imma be very mad if i dont see golden freddy
Matpat I’ve watched your full Fnaf timeline game Theory vids like 3 times already I think I’m gonna get up to 5 by the time the movie comes out , gotta be fresh on all the LOREEEEE for when I go see the movie 😎
The movies are a different universal timeline
tell you what,that left eye has a handprint.why?freddy is trying to get the mask out his face.keep making theese awesome vids!!:)
wait Mtpt has a kid?
It’s awesome to see FNAF in a Film Theory video instead of a Game theory for the first time, who would of knew?! 🤯😁
i think the "cupcake" kid would actually be the crying child because of his striped shirt
Am I the only one who just found out his full name was Mathew Patrick
I can’t wait for all the angry parents who take their kids to see this but don’t know what it’s about. I see so many kids obsessed with FNAF who are like 8,10,12 years old 😂
There's petty and then there's, stalking a kid's Instagram to expose information about this movie petty. — Nice job 😅
Ñice
I think the 5th kid is puppet because of the stripes or its cc for the same reason
SOLVE THE ONE PIECEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 🥺
Think about it the kid that's the cupcake has tripes on his shirt and who else has stripes The Puppet
BRO THE 5TH CHILD MIGHT BE THE CRYING CHILD HEAR ME OUT THEY BOTH HAVE STRIPES IN THER SHIRT AND FREDBEAR MIGHT APEAR
Is the Fnaf cook book gonna give the recipe to extracting remnant and using it to reanimate dead things to life ???
bros gonna get that kid fined💀
i think susie’s dog is cupcake
no, the purple kid is bonny, brown is freddy’s, red kid is foxy, yellow kid with top hat is golden freddy, and yellow kid is chica
MATPAT PLS DO AN EPISODE ABOUT THE OLD SHOW BO ON THE GO 🙏🙏🙏🙏
i think that chica and the cupcake is a funtime freddy and bonbon type situation.
Matt patt there is a reference in a movie on Netflix called spy kids

matpat after essintially stalking some kid on instagram so that he knows how many hairs are on freddy's left leg
Find the One Peice
I dont care if anyone agrees I just gotta say it.  You dedicating more than 40% of your videos to fnaf and most of those videos being mid at best has just completely water down any enthusiasm I have for your videos. These feel cheap and you having four channels feels like you're spread thin and the quality is meh. Not meant be a hate comment just a disappointed (I guess ex) fan
C00k b00k
Well now it’s gonna be delayed. They gotta change the lore because matpat got it right
Can you do Jurassic pike analogue horror
I do agree with pretty much everything in this theory besides the part with Abby getting stuck in baby, Scott did say he wanted to have the movies to based off of the first three movies and that’s it. So I don’t know how they would set her up in the movies.
THEORY IDEAAA What does the J in Anthony. J Crowley mean and does it have a relation to religion? (I’m Good Omens delulu)
What if the kid with the stripped shirt is the puppet
Dam so no henry, seems disappointing ngl, hopefully the movie is good
I’m thinking the kid with the brown stripped shirt could be puppet but it wouldn’t make sense
can you do a theory on a show called Karate Sheep? It’s in netflix
I wish they would have done one movie per game or per every two games.  It still looks good, but I don't know how good it'll be if it's a mash up.
Matpat clone riggy is back
Can you solve the missing mystery of a Chinese cartoon call big Bear and small Bear about there missing mother
could the unknown kid be puppet?
Team Theorist = Team Android based
i feel like the movie is not finna be scary but for the story ill watch it
15:22  I dont know if other people think this but the design of the shirt, could it be the puppet?
Bro that’s not how afton became SpringTrap he got springlocked I swear that matpat is censoring the lore so he gets more views
SOOO EXCITED!!!
Terrible theory why didn’t he mention the springlock scene at the end
Springlock failure has left the chat*
that is NOT vanessa
I’m pretty sure saws are only mentioned in one place FNAF WORLD Halloween update Jack-O-Chica she has the move buzzsaw that is the only place I remember seeing a saw but fnaf world isn’t really canon it’s just the only place I remember seeing a saw
HO BOY, Lets are how many things are gonna get Debunked, and how many things are gonna be Right
what if the 5 kid is the puppet,  i mean he has the stripes like the puppet
Film theory idea if you analyzed a sam and Colby video to see if ghosts are real that would be crazy and in another account I said something like ghost theory would be amazing and style theory is amazing also love The Chanel the videos are amazing
But that's just a theory a GAME THEORY
Me: I sure hope this isnt a spoiler

looks a little corny
What if Scott saw all of this coming and laid out a trail he knew MatPat would follow so that MatPat can't figure the movie out before the release? 5D chess move.
ong fedy frizzbarr!11!!
GOTTA LOVE THE LOREEEE.                      -MatPat
mat pat new theroy  about riggy and his files about 2 riggy 2 idk 1 pang and how is billy and why did riggy not save billy
2:56  I thought it was a springlock suit
Bro spoiled the movie before it camed out💀💀💀💀
Matpat, please do a theory on the amazing world of gumball.
Make the FNAF series even more confusing?  Yeah that sounds like hollywood. I hope they dont go the way of the asshole by claiming all fnaf vids as copyright strikes 😒
Nice
William appleton is real guys
I think he should totally do the movie “mad gods” because of October coming up
Now what about a theory about the film theory, Matpat is actually on the movie and he is acting like he isn't in the movie because he is actually making hype in fanbase. We didn't saw him in the trailers so the trick can keep working.
Hey MatPat could  u please do a theory on Dead end: Paranormal Park
Hey The Film Theorists I have something to sayin your first How to Train Your Dragon video you forgot that Toothless gets a Tail in a video
Fnaf is finally in film theory
I'm so angry that Scott cawthone didn't cast Matpat in the fnaf movie, Matpats the exact reason why there's a movie
Hey Mapat have you do theroy about adventure time
Y’all should do a film theory on lalaland like the parallels that take place in the movie
anyone else feel like the kid in the striped clothes is the puppet?? its just a kid being in the cupcake doesn't make a lot of sense to me
Day 1 of asking Matpat to do a coraline theory
Nice video 👍
Can’t wait for sister location next
15:04 that outfit reminders me of the crying child
I also have a theory. Why is Vanessa there if she's from SB and SB happens around the 2040s. The FNAF 1 happens in 1993. Vanessa is in her 20s during SB, so she was born somewhere in the 2020s, probably a few years after 2023. Did she time travel to 1993 to meet Mike? But, I don't think that's a good theory. Another theory could be that Vanessa here in the movie could be the SB Vanessa's grandma, and her parents named her Vanessa just after her grandma, and that's ofc if she doesn't die in the movie because I have a feeling she could as we see a scene of her in the hospital.
Can you make a Theorie over villainous that would be great
So, where does buff helpy come into all of this?
of course matpat has got to figure out the whole movie before it even comes out 😂
Ok I have a question for matpat have you ever did a theory on adventure time and if so when and if you haven’t already will you please do one discussing the lore behind it for a refresher of the community
I know that everybody has had a huge complaint about the eyes of the animatronics but that’s just it cause they nailed everything else so I’m happy with how much they nailed everything else about them to a T it’s like it’s straight out of the games I’m very excited for it and to see the reveals we get to see
I think that the kid in the middle with no resemblance to any animatronics, I think it's mike's brother, Garrett, but idk
Tbh, the movie looks pretty awful. I'm betting the story won't make much sense and the fact that they're making it for a wide, general audience doesn't bode well
That is literally just the scooper
I hate FNAF.....
Please make a video on emesis blue
But what about corrrryyyyyyyyyyy
I thought it was the kid from the bite of 83
The kid has a stripe shirt he is the crying child, he also possesses just like you said in the ultimate timeline
MatPat I was here since I was 6 and I really love to see how far you come. Also can u do a theory on Ninjago or a new Pokémon?
Your name is Matthew Patrick !?
7:34 Maybe it’s possible that he’s phone guy? I Ben though career counselor and night guard are different positions, it would make sense that this career counselor might have some experience with the job he works with, and still might be doing that job.
I think Steve Raglan is a fake name made by afton to get closer to the pizzeria
Your scripting is usually so flawless. Your scripting is usually so flawless.
It comes out on my birthday
You should do a film theory about salad finger episode 12
This channel is my source of serotonin besides photos of frogs in top hats 🐸🎩

Matpat could you perhaps make a theory about the last episode of the Star Wars show Ahsoka and just what exists on the planet that they are on in the last episode, some think that it might be Abeloth or something else, I would love to know what you think, God bless you and your family
The name "abby" is also a nickname commonly used for people called Elizabeth
0:28 ayo 🤨
I'm partway through the vid, ar the party where Steve Raglan is being discussed, so forgive me if it is mentioned later but in all the shots we see of Steve he is wearing a purple tie.  Now in each trailer the pattern on them is different (in one it is striped, in another dotty) but it is always the same shade of purple. Coincidence, nah. I don't think so!
Hey film theory can you pls check out liminal land its an ARG  about and funpark but somethink is off about this funpark becas i want an theory about it but first i give an tip its bigger then you think
Oui yu rockin that Fazdrip bruv
Cory is the big bad actually

Steps to not knowing FNAF.   Step-1: become Amish. Step 2: Make your new home be a rock. AND step 3: If 1 n 2 dont work. Take a helpful dose of class c Amnestics, Im sure the SCP foundation would be willing to hand them out like candy
Can you solve Boywithuke I think there's a secret
15:05 The fifth child is the crying child. Based on the fact that he is wearing a striped shirt and blue jeans, just like crying child does.
BRO THE MOVIE ISNT EVEN OUT YET
I still think the fifth kid is the crying child
the saws are inside the animatronics face and when opend only on a few theres saws
The only time I watched Film Theory
10:02 MOM I SWEAR THATS PURPLE GUY
8:09 hold on this could be the bite of 87 sorry i mean 83😂
this made me think the movie came out tried to look for it on a site😅😂
reading the comments without context of the video made me laugh
Everyone gangsta until there’s a guy that says ‘The animatronics do be quirky at night’ in the movie. Or even a Food theory testing the FNAF Cookbook’s Recipes!
Mat should do a theory on elemental I would watch
Hello Everybody My Name Is matpat and welcome to five nights at LOOOORE
Can you try to solve the lore of tik toker scaroflove (day #1)
Can you do helluva boss pleaseeeeeee
I think the kid with the tophat is golden freddy. bc he has gold on! And the one in brown next to the kid who is bonnie is  freddy.
2:05 Name that psychopath!! 🐏 👀 🐂🏋️
good
Raise your hand if you went to game theory for this video because..FNAF
Please please please please please please please please Tell as Naruto And One piece fans Who would win Naruto or Monkey D Luffy 😢😢
the 5th child has a striped shirt hes most likely crying child
Nice
Next sponsor: YouTube (how!?)
Man, even the movie adaptation failed to beat the animatronic designs of battington.
I wouldn't say he has no connections explicitly linking him to any characters. He does have the striped shirt. Kinda a loose connection, but aside from the bunny ears the other connecting items are pretty loose aswell. Just an observation. I do think it would be more narratively satisfying if I was wrong.
Can you do a video on disenchantment it's a great show packed FULL of lore, love the vids
Hey matpat plz read this listen to bringing us home it should help for a future theory plus I love watching the fnaf theory series
Mm
What if Abby has a personality disorder and baby is her other personality
the fifth kid is dressed like the crying child though
Anyone else notice the intro is gone? I miss it :(
I assume the face shredder is from a nightmare that a character is having.
Imagine having Matt in your theater and some how pausing it and going over each pixel
iAlWaYsCoMeBaCk
Ppl who watched this at night 😢 👇
mat stop now that they have seen it there going to twist it just to make you wrong and ruin everything.... let them have it just this once
Could the 5th child become the puppet? Since both have stripes, that could be what they're referencing. And the puppet showing up at the end could be the twist that MatPat is looking for.  They think they've won, and puppet shows up saying/indicating "There are more of us... So many more." And we would be giving a glimpse of different versions of the animatronics, like glamrock versions and so on. And each version is possessed by a different child's spirit. This would also explain why they act somewhat differently from game to game.   Of course, that's just my theory, a NyteDragon theory. 😋
Oh no Freddy is going to break the place that you do theorists 😨
Steve raglan is a scramble of ever lasting. I can’t believe matpat with his over examining missed this.
He not the cupcake he is even
People are the size of people, cupcakes aren't. explain how that guy would even get in there.
Lllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
If bro solves this movie we and we dont get a second and third movie im blaming you matpat
My son can't wait until the fnf movie
Mak3 a theory of howtobasic if you dont know him hes just a guy that makes simple tutorials if you dont know why i wqnt to do a theory for him...         Watch him
You should make a video about the political standpoint of Daniel tigers nabor hood (communism fascist demarcated) ext
I love this videos sooo entertaining
MATPAT WANTS TO PLAY
Hello Film theory! Can you make a theory on the popular web series BFDI/Battle For Dream Island? It might be interesting so i hope u make a vid of this!
WE LIVE 😄WE LOVE ❤️ WE LIE 😢
It feels weird seeing FNAF on Film Theory
I hope the FnaF Movie will get the sequel that would be great franchise fnaf movie
fnaf epic
Even google sponsoring him now
Have the tracks float but rods with rings so float up and down no side to side meaning the train needs to be able to float
bro it's not even released
the spy kids movie refrences you lol do a thery pls
Abby: I’m Abby  Me: IM ADDY! 😨   I’m next 🥲
"I solved the fnaf movie" then 50 theory's later it's still not solved.
Real
the fact that google sponsored MatPat shows how famouse he is
Matpat, can you teorize Playground by Rodrigo Souza ???
Maybe its the crying child?😕
if this is the same vannesa, then how do you know she is telling the truth?
Dude cupcake attacking someone is the most funny thing i eva seen
You can google my meet any day (also that promotional segment was extremely conspicuous those with a dirty mind)
Great! Next up a theory expanding on paw patrol with paw patrol the mighty movie and I already know you’re gonna be looking for LOOOOOOOOOORE! Ready for action Ryder sir because Matt Pat will be on the case again💼. Get ready to be in theatres September 29th.
matpat your amazing but ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET CHILL IK ITS GONNA BE THE TOPIC OF LIKE 50 VIDEOS BUT CALM DOWN
bro solved something that hasnt even been released yet 😭
Yes red shirt but there was stripes you know who else has stripes the puppet
Matpat make a video on fionna and cake!!!
It didn’t even come out yet, and you already solved it 🧍‍♂️
I know this isn’t FNAF but it’s two great theories about tdi the where was Izzy, and the Izzy isn’t crazy theory.
The legend is back
Surprised MatPat overlooked that the odd kid out was wearing a striped shirt lol  Like the fnaf4 kid
my personal theory for this movie is this is the original incident. now if we are to go with the theory that the first 6 games are just that. games. loosely based on real events as put by fazbear PR. so this could be what the actual real life events of FNAF 1. where maybe there was no william afton, but a killer named steve ragler, a police officer named vanessa who coincidently has the same name as a future security officer
Who thought that GOOGLE, the people who own youtube, would sponsor MatPat
the fifth kid if you look closley to the clothing are you sure it isnt the crying child? i get that theres multiple theories but the crying child makes since the most
May I need you to primes me this one thing, PLEASE DONT SAY THAT THIS MOIVE IS CANNON. PLEASE
I think Mike’s remnant goes into Golden Freddy and that’s why Abby is so fixated on him because she knows it’s her father and there looking at the pizzeria knowing their life will never be the same
I dont know man, that kids head and hair kinda looks like a cupcake 😂😂
1:10 well, i just simply doesnt care about the 'latest trending' except playing focus on my favourite youtubers .... and playing both pokemon go & pubg mobile, lol
Hey matpat I here there is a talk that a spirit can be at multiple places at once and still be able to do what ever these children are able to do like possess a animatronic or push something over all that and the animatronic still moving around

MatPat needs to do one of the StanleyVerse
can you do a theory on helluve boss
I really do hope do see crying child and flashbacks of bite83 in this movie his story is really unique and well written and would be an amazing twist for a movie
I think the kid he thought was the cupcake, is the crying child. Look at the clothes, the striped t-shirt and the blue pants. Coincidence? I think not
You should make theory about Woodlands national Park
😂
My 10 year old Quentin says you should do a video on Knarfy ad half arg!
Something to take into account when it comes to the possible future fnaf movies....  In the both the games and books, we see that there are what seem to be three big bads to look out for:  1. William Afton/Springtrap 2. Baby 3. And finally and most recent, the Mimic  This means that when it comes to the movie universe's timeline, we most likely will see those other two villains pop up at some point in later films. The question though is how will the Mimic be incorporated in this world? Will it be super old like in the games and books? Perhaps we'll get to even see interact with Vanessa in person at some point. In this franchise, the possibilities are endless.
15:16 i think the child is crying child.His shirt is the same but maybe not....
Me questioning fnaf lore......💄👄
Wheres my fozfashion!

Can you make a theory about..  that duck who likes grapes (the duck song
MATPAT JUMPSCAR!!! 🎉🎉🎉
It would make sense for Abby to become baby obviously because of her name but also because if mike is Micheal and garret is Chris (The crying child) then the only sibling left would be Elizabeth/Liz who, in the lore, is supposedly taken by baby to become her after Willian told her not to go near her
Bruh, If its not canon there's no point. I was really hoping to see part of the lore placed into movie form
I honestly think the kid with a strippy shirt isn't a cupcake. I think he's the puppet somehow
Knarfy arg
please please please do a series of unfortunate events
Bro, that one kid it is the striped guy
me: going to close the video       matpat: BUUUT
It was only a matter of time before fnaf took over film theory as well.
It isn’t even out yet 😭
Matpat it’s time season two it’s coming shorts war it’s probably coming next month but we are getting hints
Fnaf is infesting the theory channel
I think it's kinda clever that they released this movie in the year 2023. Because if what you said is true and william afton died in 1993, and 30 years has flown by, what year would it be right now? (I know this might be wrong, but I just wanted to say it.
Video 64 of asling matpat and head editor dan to make a video about gimkit lore
Maybe in the end afton comes back to destroy the animatronics and it ends with a spring lock failure (definitely not hoping to see this scene)
Bro the movie ain't even out chill 😭
The 5th kid looks like he'll be the puppet not a cupcake ... just my input 🤷🏻
It has truly been so long.
Theory: Steve Raglan, the employer, is William Afton. If you mix the letters, you get "Everlastang", replace the 'a' with an 'i', you get "Everlasting", a play on Afton's term "I always come back".
Matpat is fnaf's biggest fear
I have been waiting
HC'A CLL EWCO BWCROI HA RORO :(
Mat noooo strippey shirt crying child? And Mike gets stuffeddd mattttt😭😭😭😭
great
I remember back in 2014 when i was seven i was scared shitless whenever i saw freddy on games websites
Just on the fifth child seen in the woods too, they're wearing a dark shirt with pale horizontal lines and blue jeans. Crying Child wears...
i actually use meet too
matpat i love fnaf so im gonna watch this after the fnaf movie in case you are right
THIS MIGHT BE RIGHT  WE GOT NEW MOVIE SPOTS OF  STANDING WITH THE ANIMATRONICS OMFG SEARCH UP: 4 BRAND NEW FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY’S MOVIE TV SPOT TRAILERS!
shorts  s2 is here dont be late again lol
No way, this MADMAN, he solved the movie BEFORE IT WAS OUT, MATPAT YOU SICK GENIUS
I'm so excited for the new movie even if it kinda got spoiled but it's fine
Daddy
Time stamp to skip the sponsor 11:12
man if afton goes springlock falite, that whuld be tarryfying
What I thought is that Mike is Golden Freddy
5th kid looks like hes misses an eye.  That would aline with golden Freddy
Aint no way the movie didn't even release yet and he already thinks he solved it 💀💀
I think that maybe afton will show up in the second movie as springtrap because i think that afton will find the rotten springtrap and springtrap will grab him and them both characters will become springtrap making the suit messy and destroyed trying to fit two people inside.
scotts gonna anounce the sequel in like 5 minutes to prove matt wrong
CORY?!
I'd personally like to see a ghost and pals theory as most of there songs have creepy lore (especially housewife radio) It would also give us a break from the millions of fnaf videos you have made.
Hey I’ve been Watching your channel for a while and I was wondering if you had ever done a Coraline theory? There’s a Book and a film if you haven’t please could we get a Coraline Theory? Would make my day xx
Sans Undertale is canon to the Shorts ARG. Confirmed by Danno Cal Draws. Video by @CyberLegends_Animations.
I dont think the animatronics wanna make abby like them. I think theyre actually trying to protect her from springtrap
So far I really like Vanessa and hope she doesn't turn evil, atleast until the 3rd movie.
15:46 i thought you said in an old video that cupcake had its own soul
I think that mike gets put in the golden Freddy suit and that’s why she’s staying with him because that’s her brother.
The fifth kid could actually be the Cupcake. Look at the shirt if the kid and the candle of the cupcake
Bro The FNAF Movie missed out casting Matpat as Phone guy with a FlameSaw SMH.🙄
Try rusty lake games
Anyone else think Matpat should be playing a Mentally insane researcher for the fredbear dinner tragedy locked away in a mental asylum spewing all kinds of extremely obscure fnaflore to the MC
The cupcake watching and attacking someone is a easter egg/based off a old Fnaf theory I believe.
Can you give me a shoutout on one of the episodes it’s my birthday
17:13 HE USED THE NOWAYING IMAGE
Good theory but what ab the female villain?
THAT FIFTH KID IS THE CRYING CHILD
Wait what if Vanessa is this movies chief burck (Carltons dad) also what if mikes younger sister is the other soul in gf
Who wants a mat pat arg actually like guys. Think bout it. It would be awesome. Do it pls
I didn't know about fnap until like a month ago and I only found it a month ago because a friend asked me to watch like 4 or 5 of your videos about it and instead I watched all of them every single one
Dude my birthday is when the movie comes out so I can't wait to see the movie 🍿
I really hope you notice me because there is a YouTube show called one it’s an object show which has a lot of lore and it made by cheesy hjf I think please make a theory about this 😮@filmtheory
if this is true matpat just spoiled us
lol i bet if you guessed it right they're so mad.  Everyone whos watching the movie with me:  👇
even after matpat wasn't in the movie he still made a theory (talking about the employee's of the month wall)
Fnaf = game Movie = Film Freddy’s pizza = Food Animatronic “Suits” = Style  Sorry Mat, Sorry
I got one more theory.   If we have learned anything from movies with two people of opposite genders around the same age as some what main characters.  Vanneassa and the main character fall in love at the end of the movie.?
im 10 and im going to the movie
bout samsung
What are you going to do if you are wrong? Cry in your bedroom?
All you do is put logic into something without logic😡😡😡
I love how the Fnaf community has slowly gone crazy with theories, they could theorized a trailer
I believe that Abby will be caught by Afton and turned into Baby.
Considering how FNAF 2 was a prequel to FNAF 1 it wouldn't surprise me if they found a way to make a sequel to this movie
I bet you can’t make a theory about Centaur world
Yes matpat got his  sanity back
Fnaf made its way to Film Theory
yeah,remnant🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5:02 can we keep the series in Utah I don't want it to be anywhere near me!
Could you possibly make a video on limbo?
I think it’s becoming obvious now that this William is more like the books with his story not being revolves around the kids of his own, also having a fake identity etc, he really doesn’t seem to parallel with the games William much other than being a child murderer wearing a Bonnie costume
the first jumpscare is scary
Hey film theory can you theory about chimpie chippas?
IM MORE SUPRISED HE GOT SPONSERED BY *GOOGLE* MEET THAN THE LORE
Lily's garden said nu uh we want to be back on your channel so she's back is back
What if the kid William afton kidnapped is grant
What happened to DHMIS
the stripy shirt seems familliar
Can You Make A Lore Video About The Smurf Cat?
You should do a video on the Garfield star way on YouTube
aye Matpat, this could sound rlly dumb and i may be wrong but didn't the girl that got stuffed into chica have a dog that died?? maybe her dog possessed the cupcake!! o.o however that's just a theory, myyyy theory 🧁🧁🧁 annndddddd cut
wut
maybe the fifth kid is the second child inside Golden Freddy? we've established that Golden Freddy has 2 souls inside him, so I think it'd make sense^^
when i got the trailer as ad on yt for the first time and i saw cory i straight up screamed i didn't expect that
Mike's dad is william afton what do you mean
I’m so excited for this movie. I’ll be honest I’ve never played the games because first person makes me seasick annoyingly 😂 but the lore is so interesting. I hope the movie will make me get it a bit easier!
Matpat plz plzzz do a theory on the horror movie talk to me, it's the perfect movie to make a theory on
raglan might be the phone guy
WHAT ABOUT BOISVERT 🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
15:16 clearly the puppet
Hi matpat I’m amber I been watching this show on Disney + called dog with a blog it about this family with a mum dad 2 daughter and the oldest a son but they got a new dog that can talk and writes a blog but I have a big question is that in episode one the dog said I was like board with a way to talk English  but in almost every episode he says some thing like I’m alien or he was a person but got turn into a dog so witch is the dog a alien person that turn into a dog or just born that way please answer this has bother me for year
..I thought the fifth kid is the puppet, because of the striped in his shirt
Day 2 waiting matpat a emesis blue theory
Calling it now, or not cause I'm guessing it's pretty obvious, the post-credits to this film will 100% gonna be a Springtrap jumpscare.
Do more one piece please
im sorry, A SECEND MOVIE?!
good
2:40 About that one detail. This is, probably, a dream. Nightmare. In the previous trailer, we saw Mike sleeping at his workplace. Why wouldn't the director use this as another opportunity to scare the viewer? Without making this a lore-thing. I personally just really don't like the Remnant concept. I'd like to think that the film will stay away from all this. You know what i mean? Those who read the comment, do you agree with me?
The meme
Was that the bite of 87
That machine is an animatronic head
I believe it is possible that the extra kid could be the puppet (stripped shirt). Would be pretty sick twist, but who knows
Dear @Mattpatt.  I really love the theory. But you made a mistake and the mistake is about Garrett (Golden Freddy) and Abby.  If Garrett is the younger brother of Mike, and Garrett is Golden Freddy when he hangs out with Abby who is Mike's daughter. Then Abby is hanging out with her Uncle not her brother.
I am sincerly hopping on of the movies has the Connection terminated speech XD
Hey Matt, have you ever heard of the audioplay “Reverse Transmission” by Ben O’Brien and Param Anand Singh ? It’s 2 hours long and I feel like it is the end all be all test for anyone who theorizes media. I've only seen one person on Youtube attempt to decipher it. Their video is longer than the audio play itself and even they couldn't figure out everything. I don't know if it'd be good content since it isn't the mainstream stuff you usually tackle but I really think you might enjoy it even if you don't make any videos on it. <3
Just like in 2:36 where a robot has saws, in The Fourth Closet there is a scene where Elizabeth's face turned into a saw
Hear me out, the security guard is a ghost. why would someone show up that late at night and know that much about what happened so many years after the establishment shut down. It’s basically a cold case and like she says it shut down “back in the 80s” so we know it’s been a while. So far it also seems like she only appears inside or around the building, which I feel further shows she’s tied to the pizzeria, and is a trapped spirit along with the children. Idk probably not but if she were it’d be such a cool twist.
It makes sense that the guy is cupcake as the chica girl had blond hair so did he they also could be related
the fifth kid is wearing a striped shirt so he could be the puppet
I want to see the movie just to see if it’s good but seeing adults genuinely be into the game and lore is just weird to me. Bc I’m only 23 and I think it’s childish. Maybe bc when I was 17 a kid who sat by me on the bus would not shut up about it and the now non existent Facebook game (we stopped at the elementary school/middle school/high school. Yes crowded bus). I understand like Lord of the rings, or elder scrolls, Zelda, etc. But, even if it wasn’t intended for kids it was childish enough to drag them in. Chuck E Cheese type place that’s only gimmick is jump scares but not as scary or morbid as like outlast 2. Plus you get used to the jump scares very quickly w a VERY simplistic goal of survive the night. So after a couple nights you know what to expect.  Idk enjoy what you want. But, it’s similar tho not as bad as my little pony adults were. He has a kid so I get where it comes in handy to already be interested in such things.
Its not even out and hes already solved it-
can you please do a theory on willy's wonderland
I like how he makes the channels like seperate beings, film theory stealing stuff from game theory i love that lol
What if Abby is their stand in for Jason, Marla's brother from the Silver Eyes??
bwuh
Fashion theory for FNAF - can you a suit of spring traps that is SAFE?!?!?!?!?!
What if the 5th child is puppet and I only say that due to the fact that they wear stripes on their shirt.
Shorts wars season 2 is out make a theory about it
thank you fanf october 27 is my birthday.Okay back to my qestion mat you have been keen with winne the pooh so i want to know is roo the kagaroo cub because we only see his mom and so what happened to his dad and is he adopted? Thank you if you can make this commet into a video.
Matpat joined the advanced server and is just spoiling the movie
*video starts* *purple man dancing* "It's been so long"
Nice
I cant believe its been 8 years!!
ok must say before i finish the video mike gets stuffed
imagine if he just spoiled the whole movie
FILM THEORY CHECK DANNO DRAW CLONE RIGGY IS STILL ALIVE SEARCH RIGGY IS BEING CLONED AGAIN?
Idunno if there's any real evidence to this, but I have my own theory that Golden Freddy is Mike Himself. I have no proof, but I think he gets shoved in the Remnant Extractor and his ghost somehow possesses the golden suit in one last attempt to keep his little sister safe.
Hey matpat there is a new saw movie coming out next month and the trailer is on YouTube
Lore lore lore lore
Hehanghsnsbh👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾👾
He is going to get me
Help me
Save me
I just saw A Haunting in Venice with my mom and got into a pretty heated debate on wether or not the place was actually haunted. My mom says no because the detective was being poisoned by the hunny like the daughter, Alissa, was which caused him to hallucinate. But the kid of the doctor never had any of the hunny and was never poisoned but still heard and saw the ghosts just like the detective. There’s also a side story about a bunch of children being locked in the dungeon basement and starved to death of the house that left as this huge plot hole. Please please please PLEASE look into this cause I think it would make a great film theory!!!!!
IM EVEN MORE HYPED BECAUSE ITS RIGHT ON MY BIRTHDAY
The Ultimate birthday gift, the fnaf movie
its not spring trap its spring bonnie so i think they will active spring lock and then trap him.
Happy appy
Hi mat. I was wondering whats the real reason why purpleguy placed childrens souls on the animatronics. Is it for business purposes? Or something more bigger?
I liked my own comment
I know that this comment will get buried but how can you not tell that the thing the machine is someone getting stuffed in the suit to look at the silhouette it's obviously a Freddy or Bonnie head and the guy who's getting stuffed is a security guard we first saw in the first teaser trailer who got attacked by one of the animatronics
Hey if you look at the cast it says that the therapist person is William afton
HOW???
OKAY  BUT NOW DO IT W TINTED SUNSCREEns
I CANT WATCH IT CUZ IM A KIIIDDDDDD
bro it corekicx if i splle it worg my bad
I was about to look up "Who posseses the cupcake fnaf" then you said it was the 5th child lol
Carl the cupcake has stripes and the kid does too, and the stripes are the exact same color so you are most likely right
Matpat season 2 it's going to be out at winter 2023 we got a little leak so I think u can make a theory due to 2 minutes lore video
Didn’t it use to say that lillard was afton on google?
Film theory idea how fast is officer earl running?
I really hope this movie finally puts a end to the question “is Bonnie blue or purple”
Is this illegal??
Gerret, similer to GREGORY, doncha think
i just assumed that Abbey wasn't real, she's a ghost that Mike decided to take in and hasnt realized that she died yet.
🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬜⬛🟪⬜⬛🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛🟪 🟪🟪⬛⬛⬛🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪
Hey MatPat if you ever need a break from FNAF I would love to see a ninjago thanks
I wonder how many actors are now in trouble for accidentally revealing the plot in their instagram comments/captions
According to the FNAF Wiki, "Steve Ragaln" is actually an alias being used by William Afton in the film universe. Sooooo....mystery solved there.
So, if this movie DOES end with Spring trap defeated and sealed away... does that mean we get to see the Spring lock scene??
film theory squid game 2 is coming         in december 2023
Hey film theory I have a really good show that I think you should watch and it's my favorite show and I would love to see all your theories on it 😁
MATPAT THE BEGINNING OF SHORTS WARS 2 HAS STARTED.
If there's a FNAF style theory, I want to know the best way to get material to make a character cosplay
just a friendly reminder that dannodraws has posted a shorts wars season 2 relevant short a few hours ago,
What if Mike is inside Golden Freedy in the end?
I am telling you that MIKE will be stuffed into the Golden Fredy...that why is Abby with him in the car
Spoiler?
Again
hey matpat! you should try out this pretty underrated video thats like fnaf called FNAR: TAPE 1, its like fnaf but dinosaurs,  after watching the video im pretty sure theres a hidden story, can you try and solve it?
Oh no… the fnaf obsession is expanding to film theory soon food theory will be next
stalking kids social media for theory snipets. matpat is slowly becoming a afton?
Lol 😭 anyways hi whoever manages this account, I’ve got something to tell you. Recently a friend of mine has taken his own take in remaking the fnaf franchise with his own little twist in it and I would like if you could ask or tell someone who’s in charge of everything to check it out. It would be awesome if you film theorists could atleast view the video. You can find it in “Dilomotion” and if you guys are lucky you might find the code to the secret link.
I love freddy fazbear with a deep passion.
It’s not over
The cupcake child has crying child’s clothes, it has to mean something
no no no no no no the crying child is Shadow Freddy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no no no no no no the crying child is Shadow Freddy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no no no no no no the crying child is Shadow Freddy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CLONE RIGGY IS STILL ALIVE AND ALSO be careful because the clones may come back
This might not be heard, this might not be looked up on, but I would like a theory on: cliffhanger hanging from a cliff. It short series from the tv series Between the lions.  I need to know if he is dead or something. Please theory group can you help me out with this?
you mentioned a cookbook. TIME FOR FOOD THEORY TO GET IN ON THIS TOO
Mattpat season 2 of shorts wars is starting to get on it fast
How can the 5th kid be the cupcake MatPat? I'm asking because it looks pretty obvious that a kid wouldn't fit in there.
Wouldnt that kid just be the puppet?  He's wearing stripes
Fun fact my moms co-workers (and my science teacher) brother’s girlfriend is the director of the fnaf movie 👍
I think the kid in the brown shirt is freddy and the kid with the yellow clothes and yellow top hat is golden Freddy but idk
Mike has clearly not been to Nebraska
Mmm Google meat, a delicious branded steak that you can eat Wikipedia articles off
Seriously stripe shirt it’s Gregory
I hate that FNaF takes place in Utah! This is because I live in Utah I’m scared of the yellow bunny man! 😆😳  (6:58 )
is the movie going to be like the books in the sense that some of the lore will corelate with the games but it sits in its own universe?
Bro the movie ain’t even out yet
THIS IS A FNAF MOVIE THEROY IT HASENT EVEN CAME OUT YET DO A MONUMENT MYTHOS THEORY OR I UNSUBSCRIBE AND DISLIKE ALL VIDS!
Hey mat can you talk about this series " Lacey's Flash Games" it has a very disturbing vibes
Can you do a theory on BoyWithUke
Im glad Game theory already has a caricature of Markiplier
You know I found a really good parody of FNAF called FNAR (five nights at raptors) it is not a game but a vhs tape. I think it could be awsome if you kinda tried to figure out the lore behind it. I watched it and yeah there is definitely lore. It is on the channel Dilomotion you should check it out😃
Im gonna have to come back to this, to avoid spoilers, because MatPat will probably somehow predict the entire movie down to a cockroach scuttling across the floor. I want to go into this completely blind aside from the official trailers so I can enjoy this (especially since we've been waiting 7+ years at this point)
And yet i still have to pay for one hour to talk...
Listen I’m happy as long as it doesn’t entirely stray from the story and a few people die  Is that too much to as for
please please fnaf movie add fnaf 4 i will literally scream in excitement if it is gonna be in the movie
I thought the 5th kid could’ve been the puppet, but I guess not…
My brother have the  Fnaf costume.😂 0:50
Honestly, it's probably gonna get delayed again. I have been passively watching since the announcement I think was around the second game (don't quote me on that, I'm going off my memory of time), in my mind it's a little like Half life 3
The part where he talks about a sequel wants to make me scream in a pillow knowing that this is Scott’s last project 😭
Matpat. I think season two of shorts wars is soon. Be on the lookout for comments!
I do wonder if were gonna see all animatronics from the games at different point in time I'm hoping to see a live action withered bonnie
New lore just dropped about short wars season 2
.... . ._.. .__. __ .
Imagine if Matpat hits a "bullseye" and the Fnaf Film gets delayed and altered as Security Breach was?🗿
If Afton really wanted to fix the situation, he'd hire Nick Cage.
I remember when mat solved the godzilla movie to a tee, and I think he's done it again
Are you sure that instead of him being the cupcake he maybe the Puppet
MATPAT THERES LORE IN DANNO CAL DRAWING
Wbt alma :P (a rly short film)
The kid that MatPat said was in the car and said the actor's name is Lucas, that's also my name.  Kinda cool!
Nice video
14:39Omg he does not look like he cares ❤😂
This game is for groomers.
Pov the start• Thanks for google meat 🍖  for sponsoring a portion of this video. Pov Me• My ears diseve me
matpat you need to do a theory on run 3 lore plz
while this isn’t the only thing i noticed throughout this entire video, it is what shocked me the most… MATPAT’S A DAD!???!!!??!
Matthew patrick???
bro got sponsored by google💀
9:21 i was today years old when i found out that matpat means Matthew Patrick
MR MAT PAT SIR THERE IS NEW SHORTD WARS LORE SIR CHECK OUT DANNO DRAW'S VIDEOS. IS CLONE RIGGY ALIVE? PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO SIR.
That could be the movie's version of stuffing someone inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Also can you make a theory about the BFDI series by Jacknjellify?
It hasn’t even come out yet
15:20 the kid has a striped shirt like the puppet
MATPAT SHORTS WAR SEASON 2 IS HERE
Bro solved the fnaf movie😤😤😤😤😈😈😈😈
shoutout nebraska
Maybe Garrett is Golden Freddy...PLOT TWIST OF THE YEAR.
Bro the movie ain’t even come out yet chill🗿
So if the games up to Sister Location are supposed to be in universe games that took real life events and changed them to further Fazbear's Image, couldn't the movie be the real events that the games are based on?  This would be similar to what Matt did with his original FNAF Theory where he found a real life event at a Chuck E. Cheese's that had a ton of coincidental  similarities and thought that the game may have been influenced by the events that had transpired. This would explain why the movie would have similar elements to the games but due to the in-universe game creator not being entirely informed on the actual events why the games would have different details or altered specifics for "Artistic Liberties".
Shorts wars season 2 is starting, MatPat better prepare.
in new trailer there were withered animatronics
I believe the kid with the striped shirt will probably be marinate
How would Afton stuff a kid's body into the cupcake in order for it to get possessed though? If he didn't, how did it get possessed and where did he hid the body?
The phone guy better be in the movie ngl😭😭
Maybe they're tryna make the timeline more clear while still referencing everything else
How would the kid fit in the cupcake??????
Matpat season 2 of shorts wars is coming
My question is WHY the animatronics want to make Abby one of them? Kids murdering another kid???
The fire burning down the place could just be the ending of the movie with springtrap burning
Clone riggy back we need you
Amnesia in fnaf
Not gone cap u blew this if this movie gets pushed back I swear  You could’ve held you tongue till it was out D.A 🤦🏿‍♂️
The fake Steve raglan guy is William Acton cause to me it sounded like you were saying fake steve raglan guy isn’t William Afton
Are you mentally okay mat Pat?
unsubscribed because matpat uses an android. Disgusting.
Shorts wars 2
DO SHORTS WARS 2!!!!!!!
Matt pat I always come back mw ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Wait So Elizabeth ISN’T Elizabeth??? Abby??? THIS CHANGES SO MUCH. Edit: GARRETT??? Well, actually, that makes sense. C.C. never had a canon name.
Andy's Apple farm predicted this
Happy my name is being used in this film 😅
Wait isn’t this the movie that Nicholas cage did? And killed the robots
I wasnt shocked when matpat said one kid was cupcake it was kinda obvious
The 5 kid Has a shirt with stripes the 😢kod !
I JUST WANNA SEE SISTER LOCATION IN THE UPCOMIN SEQUENCESS
i feel like the fnaf movie is just gonna be a horrorfiy scooby doo episode
Crazy theory, but …what if…hear me out…what if Abby is the crying child ?
Dont forget too Scott wanted to make this DARK so them killing Abby isnt outlf the realm of possibility
Your theory sound really like the end of the silver eyes
I'm convinced that we'll see the nightmare animatronics in this movie. Even if it's a small little clip while Mike is dreaming.
YOU need to get on the redacted smp, there's even some morse code to solve. Also i want you to actually see this sooo. Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
2 things 1. Matpat... you started a FNAF video with "its been so many years" you had the PERFECT opportunity to say "Its been so long" Shame 2. I think that kid IS Golden Freddy (not cupcake) seeing as he is wearing a STRIPED shirt, Like the crying child in fnaf 4
We did it boys, a fnaf video on film theory
I think Matt needs to start solving cold cases from the 80s and 90s. He'd find the murderer or kidnapper or whatever so quick. He might be wrong. But he would be fast.
I want An SLG theory
I don’t think that the last kid is the cupcake. I think that due to his striped shirt that we might see the puppet.
Your to good man, I don’t think I can even finish this
shorts war season 2 coming
I need me that cookbook
Clone riggy is back he has been hiding # shorts wars 2
"It'd be weird to just have a state poster of the state that you're currently in right above your security desk"  I'm sorry what would be weird about that? (this post was made by a marylander our flag > your flag raaaaaaa)
The movie isn't even yet and he already solved it
what if the machine that mike is in is stuffing him in the golden freddy suit. which could be why golden freddy is in the car with the shogun himself cory and mikes sister
Does this make the movie uncanny
Wasn't google meet called Google duo not too long ago?
S S STRIPES STRIPES
video so good I watched the AD
Also we've seen William Afton lie about his name before, like in the silver eyes
It’s happening again the clones it’s happening go look at dannodraws MatPat!!
I think that 5th kid that you think is the cupcake is actually the crying child, you can see how his clothing is exactly the same as the crying child's clothing
The 5th kid has a striped shirt. Puppet?
I think Abby would become circus baby If the animatronics succeed . ( hopefuly they won't ) !
Do an Attack on Titan theory frfr the 🥀 will honor you
Matpat,you make good points in every one of your theories.But Why Do They Have To Make A FNAF Movie Without A SERIES FIRST???Still,love your videos:)
I found some lore in thinknoodles I can’t get Billy’s song out of my head video at the time place 10:18
It coming out on my B-day 🎉
i called cap when Matpat said everyone  working for him uses an android
Bro solved it without even watching the movie
Don't worry mattpatt if u want more lore the short wars season 2 is just getting started
Map hat season two of short swords is about to start
Since matpat wasn’t allowed in the movie he’s getting his get back by spoiling the movie😭
I am obsessed with fanf, but my parents made me not play the games which is sad cause its horror. As soon as I found out about the fnaf movie i shrieked with excitement and was crying tears of joy. Sadly i probably won’t be able to see the movie cause of my parents. All year i have been watching trailers for it and i still can’t believe that there’s gonna be a movie.  Thank you to Mr. Scott cawthon who made the whole fnaf franchise happen ❤
From the trailer clips, the best way I could describe this movie is: dumb Saw.
I think William being named Steve raglan is Probaly a cover up for his crimes.
ambatunat
I love that you chose to use mark and Emmy made as one of the 2 people models
MATPAT SEASON 2 OF CLONE RIGGY OUT GO CHECKK
Riggy clone is back look at Danno new video
no head bite in the fnaf movie. I dont want it :( lol jk
MATPAT! WE NEED YOU. SHORTS WARS SEASON 2! DANNO! NEW VIDEO!
I was kinda hoping that they did the broken lore to explain the blurry parts Heck if this is true We don't even know if mike is still afton's son and that they changed Elizabeth's name to abby and criyng Child is not even there
MATPAT THE CLONES ARE BACK WE SAW CLONE RIGGY
Hey mat the shorts war is back
@FilmTheory I actually have a theory about the continuity errors between the Tales from the Pizzaplex books and the games (it's all revealed in Submechanaphobia), didn’t know where else to get this out there. But there's a line spoken between the protagonist and his high school rival where the rival says that he likes the pizzaplexes better than the water park, implying that there's more than one Pizzaplex. Just something to put out there.
I would be so happy if they make movies that are like the lore
15:12 wait, I know, striped shirt, blue pants, 😮 it's Evan Afton from FNAF 4
My theory is that in the scene where mike is going to get shredded by the machine he dies and his soul is moved to Freddy. I thought it could be a reference to security breach and how there’s the theory’s that glamrock Freddy is mike. That’s why Abby is with him in those scenes in the trailer.
School was a “google school” which means all my online classes where on Meet
15:04 I can't belive MatPat missed that the 5th kid was wearing STRIPES! Now who in the franchise is associated with STRIPES?
Keep on going Matthew, you will eventually give more Freddy's we can Five Night
But where does markiplier fit into this
Clone riggy is back he back
MATPAT THE CLONE WARS IS STARTING!! CLONE RIGGY WAS IN A SHORT AND SAID ITS NOT READY BUT WE’LL SEE SOON. AND THERES A STREAM COMING UP ON PHALURES CHANNEL SHOWED AFTER WHICH MEANS ITS MORE LOTE GET ON THE SEARIES QUICK
what is a five nights at freddys, is it a series or smth dat sounds wierd
Clone riggy is back We need you.
YOOOOOOO I'm excited to see this movie!
Ah yes the muscular guy who took the oven and went wild inside the pizzeria just to find lores.
Good
the closed captions said five minutes at freddys
This was awesome. Now I would love to see an episode with the lore behind the power rangers
15:29 Wow i guess i some how put a full HUMAN body in a cupcake
Matpat, THE SEASON 2 OF SHORTS WARS IS KOMMING (i speculate because of the newest shirt from danno) pls like this so matpat see's this
What if the fifth kid is the Puppet? The color scheme of the kid's tshirt matches the puppet's colors
can the movie come out first? or is that too much to ask?
You just got me thinking on how (if) they could possibly incorporate Michael Afton into the movie franchise. What if in one of the sequels it was revealed the names of Mike and his brother were either switched, or Mike took on his brother's name in honor of him (for one reason or another), and our ol murderous pal, William took Mikes' brother on as a sort of prodigy?   Either through trauma or more supernatural means, he convinces the child that he's his father, forcing him to take up family name and business.

I so ready to go "I always come back" in the theater 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬜⬛🟪⬜⬛ 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛🟪 🟪🟪⬛⬛🟪🟪
Finally, Film Theory has it's own FNaF video, I'm so proud!
God I’m so excited for this movie!
Just wanna mention, that last kid that goes unidentified wears a striped shirt. Not sure if this is synonymous with the crying child but worth mentioning
Oh I thought the saw-thing was the scooper
Vr
Hey mat u remember fnaf be where the cupcake was moving?
Didn’t he try solving FNAF games before they came out already?
Ark survival please
so about the springtrap part at the end i have a feeling we will see the springlocks activate maybe when afton is attacked by one of the animatronics/characters the springlocks activate and to hide the evidence and lock afton away for good they lock him behind the wall to rot which would be a good way to show the springlock scene through this version of the story
Everyone: "Ho boy can't wait to watch the Fnaf movie" Old Man Matpat coming through the wall next to the door, Deathgripping a script in one hand: "gUYs I dID IT! i SoLVeD ThE FnAf MOvIe!!!"
I feel like this is matpats way of saying “this is what you get for not putting me in the movie”
Can’t wait for this whole video to be a red herring as the movie ends with “Co-written by Matthew “MatPat” Patrick”
Being sponsored by google meet is something I never expected
Does this mean we're getting a spring locked scene?
Matt Pat, would you consider making film theories on the new Fiona and Cake series that came out which is an add-on to the original series adventure Time? The Lore has gotten more substantial with the new addition of the Fiona and cake series and I think you could pull a lot of things from the original series, adventure Time and the distant land specials to theory craft and I think it would do extremely well
I kept hearing "Google meat", which is even funnier in the times when Matpat would speak about it without the "google" part. Mmmm. Meat.
The kid in brown is the original. Freddie and the kid in yellow is golden Freddie. Because you can see it, the kid. With no hat has brown shirt.
Peeta O.O
Only thing you need to solve is what role will puppet have in the movie (if im remember correctly they confirned puppet is in the movie)
No
5th kid's shirt has strips strips... puppet?
maybe MatPat spoiled the whole movie-
11:39 I honestly think this scene is just a kid intentionally hiding in a suit to scare their mom or whoever that is.
A film theory on final destination could be an absolute BOP
Live action Shaggy is Purple Guy confirmed.
Is the flinstones actually in the future
How did you know all of that HOW WITH ONLY 8 MINUTES 💀💀💀💀
Hi Matpat! I want to work for your team for marketing! Maybe help you get even more sponsors 🤞🏼🥹
Hi Matpat! May I suggest you make a vid on the YouTube indie analog horror story called Welcome to Dreamworld on Rainbott’s YouTube channel!  I promise you won’t be disappointed!
Do a theory on Jonny’s quest MATPAT
Fnaf exploded a decade ago??? Man I’m old
Matpat should have a lore about matpat
That 6th kid had a striped shirt just saying
the other kid that is supposedly the cupcake I think is actually the crying child
I bet this how grandparents   feel like when a old band gets back together AND go on tour I can't wait for this movie fnaf has been big in my child in today's childhood horror games only last like a month I'm talking about huggy wuggy and Amanda and garten of bandana they trend for like a 2 months FNAF LASTED FOR YEARS WHEN THESE KIDS WERE BABYS
17:49 yeah because it's before he's gone though the springlock
Imagine solving a movie without even watching it
MATPAT!! THE KID IS WEARING STRIPED SHIRT!! HELOOOOOO CRYING CHILDDDDD
If that's how the movie actually is I'm not watching it
i wish you were in the fnaf movie also can you do a fnaf theory on style theory?
Mikes dad is young willie a, Vanessa is in golden bonnie and golden Freddie never hurt no one why would the kids wanna hurt more people? They don’t like adults they like other kids
DO a theory of one or bfdi where do dead contestants go I think they go inside the recovery center for one  just do atheory
After seeing this video, I just have one theory. What if the unknown kid from the hid and seek scene is the crying child? They both have same shirt...
If they are hiding names Garret seems a bit different
Nice
e
The mike being Williams son actually makes a little bit of sense since mikes last name is “Schmidt” wasnt Williams wife’s last name also “Schmidt” do it would make even more sense that mike ran away from Arron and took his moms last name and that other guy adopted him/ took care of him
the movie doesn't even have the time to be realesed
What about Charlie
I’ve been waiting for this movie since I was 8😭😭😭
i think the torture mashine was one of the twisted ones
0:23 ooooooooo  Now i know MRL30 copied you
the one that posseses chicas cupcake its chicas dog
Irrelevant but when did google meet did sponsors?? =^
You lightened up my mood. Very good job as always 👏🏻👏🏻 love your hard work
The movie will be bad
do a theorie if the main character from the lorax is the son of the antagonist
Man their going to be scrambling to change the movie😅
Nice video
This is honestly a movie I can’t tell what will happen. It feels more related to the game yet so unrelated but the twist and turns are both very hard to read. Like for a typical movie, if ABBY would get taken away and become BABY, that would most likely mean a deal with the bad guys. However that’s not the same now. It could be like one of those scenes in FNAF 4. Which means it could be a last second cut of ABBY going to sleep and then golden Freddy is standing there in the darkness and you see the eyes turn into red
I expect a sequel coming up. Seeing that Springtrap is not a rotten zombie I have a feeling that Afton will get spring trapped at some point in the movie.
Hey matpat can you make a video about godzilla minus 1
Maybe MatPat could do a Chika’s cupcake theory while making a cupcakes as a food theory episode. Even more chaos 😂
why would google meet sponsor matpat ? theory away, people, I want to know
Why does mat pat never get sponsored oh wait that’s because I always skip it
maybe after the incident with his brother Mike was put up for adoption? Maybe he protects Abby so much because he doesn't wanna fail another sibling even if they aren't related
But why would Garret get kidnapped in a car?
"This theory exploded about a year ago" .........Wow.
15:19 the kid has stripes on his shirt. do you know who else has stripes on their shirt? that's right the crying child or chris  or evan .
Where's mah fazgoo?
"It's coming in a little over a month and YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS"  Me: "That I can't see it in theatres since I'll be recovering from birth?"  "It means that NOWHERE is safe from a FNAF theory" Me: "Oh."
If they wanna take out good ol' Willy A, they should call Nicholas Cage.
that is ridicoulus!!!!!
the cup cake kid's shirt is striped in the same color as crying child, just throwing that out there
The ONLY issue I have with all MatPat’s theories here is his complete avoidance of Mary Stuart Masterson’s character
I kept imagining that CRT TV tuned to Channel 58 (737 MHz, _NOT_ 476 MHz, AND I WANT THE WHOLE FREAKING INTERNET TO KNOW THIS!)
MatPat, Abby is short for Abigail, who's meaning is "Daddy's girl", which gives a good twist for Baby.
I'm pretty sure everyone’s known Lillard was Afton for more than a year at this point, Mat. Excellent sleuth work, as always.  Also, we don’t want to know what you use your Meat for after work, thanks.
WAT THE F### IS THE SINGULARITY!!!
do a theory about elemental movie if water and fire people can make babies
IT'S COMING OUT ON OCTOBER 25 IN MY COUNTRY
I'm sure this is a popular opinion but I am overjoyed to see Josh Hutcherson playing the lead for a FNAF movie. It just makes my inner teenage self happy lol
Has Theorist Discourse already talked about their policy on talking about upcoming film projects in the midst of the SAG-AFTRA strike? This isn't scab behavior, is it?
OH COME ON! Matpat Your spoiling everything its getting annoying at this point
Bro mat the movie hasn’t even released
One day Scott Cawthon is going to order a hit on Matpat for getting too close
The skript writers are 'ruin' ing the lore and not cool
Did bro spoil the movie before even watching it?
why is no one talking about foxy where pants in the movie when he doesn’t in the game
Doesn't The Puppet have a striped shirt?  Could THAT be the fifth child?
I love how he slipped a bite of '87 reference at 9:59
with this 5th kid, it most likely is either Carl the cupcake or Golden Freddy, but if you look at his top, you will notice that it looks like the crying child’s top a bit. who does the crying child possess? golden freddy. time stamp: 15:05 :D  this isn’t making much sense since there is evidence proving otherwise, but just wanted to say this:3
Matpat… stop saying you solved fanf because a month later you will be like “this this the final fnaf video!” And the cycle keeps going..! 😡
Was that the foxy fighters plane?
THIS VIDEO NEVER STOPS SHOWING UP FIRST THING ON MY FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I get that they want an approachable movie that a lot of families can watch without making the parents too concerned about what their kids are playing, but they seem to have forgotten what it is they are making a movie about. after all, the corpses of children are stuffed in those suits. it all seems so watered down as opposed to what the original games were like. the animatronics are not scary at all, and with how expressive  and clean looking they made them instead of their traditional haunting presence, it feels almost goofy. those big glowing eyes are not menacing it just looks like some hot sauce got spilled in them, and springtrap is also a much weaker design than his help wanted appearance. i guess it's too late to change it but i hope next time around they realize they have a horror movie to make
I'm actually scared to watch this because their is a huge chance he'll get this right.
We all need to get mayors to do a loreeeeeee video on Song generator By harke!
If William I dead then how does Abby die?
what if mike, garret, abby are the afton siblings
maybe that extra kid is the puppet? bro is in a striped shirt 15:05
I wonder if Abby is a stand in for the puppet. She's wearing stripes and the animatronics seem to trust and look up to her.
The kid had a striped shirt
Nah the stripped shirt kid might actually be the puppet, and it might be revealed in a post credits scene. And if I’m right you can come back here Matt Pat.
15:15 oh yea and Cassidy is a girl not a boy
Why would William kidnapp his own son if Mike is William's son, Matpat.
MY GUY PLEASE STOP (Lol)
dude idk if its F R E A D B E A R that evan takes over or G O L D E N S C R E A M I N G F R E D D Y
uh oh
The real reason the movie took so long was because Scott was waiting for MatPat to release his theory on the film.
The movie directors worrying about when MatPat will spoil the whole plot because they left a little to much lore in the trailers:
Is it possible that the soul of Evan is trapped in Golden Freddy?
Doesn't the crying puppet have a motive that includes stripes
IT AINT EVEN OUT YET
i feel like they nailed it with Vanessa's casting she both looks and sounds similar
I'm in agreement with this theory, however I couldn't help but wonder if the movie could put her as "the one you should not have killed." Maybe the movie ends with William/springtrap killing abby.
Spoilers Ahead                       At 15:29 Matpat says that he thinks that the twist will be the cupcake is a dead kid, but when I first thought about who the kid is, I looked at them closer and realized that they are wearing a stripped shirt, so, My thought is that they might be the puppet.
The boy, the fifth child in the movie, has a striped shirt, Gregory perhaps?
The kid has a striped shirt Meaning he could be the crying child or one of the spirits in golden freddy
@TheFilmTheorists Can You start Reacting For My Sl Movie Im Making
Welp i guess hes not in the movie or else he leaked it
Look to the twisted ones book Steve is his fake name he used when he tricked Charley it's very obvious its Afton playing as steave to trick mike
A fnaf theory in the film theory channel?? The wind is changing 😂😂
so the cupcake thing, if kids were stuffed into animatronics... did afton just shoved a body into a small-ish cupcake!?      more logical answer: afton might have shoved 2 bodies in Chica and I guess only one soul can live in one animatronic so the other went to the nearest animatronic that can be transfered to, the cupcake
As I'm only listening to this in the background, I heard Google Meet as Google Meat, and was weirded out at such an oddly specific app
Cupcake is a childs head stuffed
The stripped shirt has me thinking puppet...but like...other continuity issues...
Matpat: I think the 5th kid is the cupcake Me: THE STRIPES
Mat woooooo ❤❤❤❤❤❤
spoiler alert  matpat is purple guy
The cupcake could be possessed by chicas dog dogs bite and the cup cake is like a pet to chica
I know we don't see it in the trailer, but what about the Puppet? Do you think it's possible that the kid in the striped shirt becomes the Puppet in the movie series instead of the Cupcake? Do you think the Puppet would appear at all during the film or have a reference to it? Since its original introduction into the Five Nights at Freddy's series there have been numerous references/appearances by the Puppet throughout the games and books. To leave it out of the movie would be an interesting decision especially if they want to pull in both early and late fans of the series - i.e bringing in Vanessa from Security Breach and possibly referencing Sister Location with Abby (Baby).
As a Nebraskan I can honestly say we would definitely have a Nebraska poster hanging up because we have weird state/college football pride. Also no one would dream to move here.
AAAA I want the end scene to be Abby approaching Baby and getting YOINKED by the claw-
Imagine if golden Freddy was mikes younger brother
Finding out matpat wasn’t in this movie was devastating tbh, do better casting directors
Day one of asking Matpat to do a perfect blue theory
Wait? Aren't the books completely different from the FNAF timeline?
both me and my cousin (THEE LATINORAT) enojyed this video
Make a film theory on Maxwell gamer he has a lot of lore
I feel like the movie is going to be anti climactic, you never know.
They should hire mat patt for these movies, making the films even better by having a guy who really knows the franchise . And silencing him from spoiling the movie because he'll be working on it 😂
Be mad but I want this man to check out helluva boss. Which I don’t think he can or will (yes that’s a challenge
Hey Matpat I wanted to ask if you could do a theory about Ninjago because it was a big part of mine and many others childhood
15:21  I think it could still be golden Freddy bc of the shirt the kid has and it is similar to the shirt of the crying child
Excuse me sir you need to let some of us enjoy it before you spoil it
I'm so stoked for this movie! You have no idea! been constantly checking news etc for what feels like forever! Always look forward to these videos as well! ^_^ <3
it's always weird when he acts like we don't know anything about fnaf lol
"Be weird to have a poster of the state that you're in right above your desk"  This is embarrassingly common here in Texas 😅 If it's possible to put the Texas flag on it, trust that we will.
I think the 5th ghost kid is the puppet cause of the striped shirt.
15:20 - not cupcake. Puppet
rainbow world?
I think the mysterious kid could be the crying child? I bet Im probably wrong, but it’s just a thought. Who knows 🤣
Can you post about _boisvert its been so Long
I do still think the 5th child is golden Freddy. Why he may not have any character details he still has a striped shirt like the crying child did. But no matter the outcome, I’ll still enjoy the movie.
The ants don' picked up them Freddy Fazbear's 'n' moved 'em to Nebraska
The kid matpat thinks is the cupcake has a striped shirt just like the crying child
The 5th kid is mostly likely the mime because of his shirt
Bro how do you already solve the lore even know the movie comes out in 1 month
How does Lucas have facebook
The video we’ve been waiting years for!
I have an odd feeling that literally everything about this will be right when it does release.
If you ever feel worthless, just remember: "I lived during FNAF."
Is there a music theory? If not, get on it bro
I want to say about golden Freddy for my side I think that golden Freddy has two souls and the blue is garret/ Crying child and the red is the other person who died but u don’t see the red so we are going to only see garrot
Bro it hasnt even came out still
I strongly feel like the cupcake is supposed to be Susie's dog, since it acts as, well, an attack dog. A way to keep that association we all know about Susie, even though we feel like the dog is likely  Mangle in the games
hi kreekcraft
The last kid is the crying child duh
Ok bud
You meant seven years
why is every video on here so long winded, 20minutes to explain something that can be done in 5
Mat pat you should do a film theory on helluva boss
The mask represents the death screen with the suit with the eyeballs popping out from fnaf 1 that's my theory my GAME wait no sorry FILM THEORY
IT DIDNT NEED TO BE SOLVED PLEASE STOP THIS MAN
Already?
I believe that saw thing in the trailer  is a death bot
matpat, the kid with the top hat is golden freddy, the kid with the BROWN shirt is the BROWN bear also known as freddy fazbear
The next theory you make should be on the 2008 PBS Kids mascots which are Dash & Dot. Just sayin.
it would make sense if that kid is the cupcake because he is wearing a stripped t-shirt and the cupcakes candle has stripes
I know they going to delay the movie to change the entire plot
The FCU (freddy cinematic universe)
I was thinking the kid with the striped shirt could be the puppet because of the colors and stripes
Just a reminder for ya   You are ✨ amazing ✨
dawg the movie aint even out yet 😭
Actually, in The Fourth Closet graphic novel, baby has the same buzzsaws portuding from her face
ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET MATT
Hey film theory, I think you were wrong about them not dying Mike and Vanessa because someone was with Abby in the car
Matpat the biggest reason fnaf has gotten as big as it has
I hope there's an end credits scene Where it's Afton in the secret room trapped inside the spring Bonnie suite only for candles to light up and a music box starts playing
"The rotten corps that we all know and love" well said
The catch-22 of the theorist channel.   Theorist: Are we ruining video games and movies with our theories? Also theorist: Hey guys we're going to tell you the plot of the fanat movie before it even comes out!  Love you guys!!!!
I do not believe that cupcake is possessed by a kid. No way
Google beat my meet
Can't wait to watch this movie with my buddies
Do you suspect that there won't be any Puppet in this movie?
FIRST FNAF THEORY ON FILM THEORY
Wyatt is my cousin!!! So happy to see the one and only Matpat mention him in a film theory video 🖤
Matpat, I didn’t know what fnaf was until 3 years ago when u mentioned it in literally every game theory, so I looked for your fnaf theorys. You did this to me, matpat. YOU DID THIS. 1:14
💀 hell nah
When I clicked this video I did not except a sponsorship from google meet
Great video, i would like a theory on Kane pixel's new series
Wow, can't wait for cross channel special fnaf event like you did with the meat episodes.  Game: does help wanted two connect the books and games? Film: is the movie the CANONICAL event that inspired fnaf? Food: what is the cheapest method of making a pizza that isn't pre made? Style: can you reasonably wear the outer shell of a animatronic?
I can't wait for the 10 hour fnaf movie analysis video!
Mat pat: we’re going to solve this franchise!  TFS Perfect Cell: Prince, when has this ever worked?
Mat is getting sponsored by the company he uploads on💀
Please call William by his true name. William Appleton. You’ve talked about fnaf so much yet you still don’t know his true name 😭. Please I’ve been begging you to listen to this comment for so long. You are the only person that I can think of to spread the news besides Markplier. It would be greatly appreciated if you reply and put in your next video.
Okay, but didn't the cupcake attack independently in FNAF4, as Chicka's jumpscare?
Day 3 asking for ninjago master of spinjitzu lore video
ALL READY ITS NOT EVEN RELEASED YET HOW?!?!?!!?!
MATPAT IS A FATHER
While the movie will not have any Connection to the games i would not be surprised if they used it to do plot points that are gonna become relevant in the games at a later point in time
REMNANT?!?!
How has no one noticed the saw blades in the little music men in Ruin?
Do Helva boss next
Cant wait for the 100's of discord servers to be streaming this for free!
OH NO ABBY IS GONNA BE A ROBOT KID
I don’t think the fifth kid is going to be the cupcake, cuz in the games afton killed 5 kids, that fifth kid is probably just the movie’s version of Cassidy, there may still be a big reveal at the end that Mike’s brother is also in golden Freddy but I definitely don’t think there’s a kid in the cupcake
I think the last kid could the the son of afton
Blud leaves entire franchises  shimbring in their Timbers 💀💀💀
i love how nobody is talking about how its peetas actor- (this is why im not aloud to be multifandom)
The extra kid in the STRIPED SHIRT is probably the PUPPET.
Oh Matthew Patthew have you not learned from MCU prediction videos?😂😂
Where’s the  og intro
The entire fandom already aware of everything and trying not to ruin the movie for the rest: (I am one of these ppl been here from the beginning lol)
To be fair the cupcake has detached, moved around, and attacked as a separate entity in past game(s)
Day 30 of asking matpat to make a theory on emesis blue
As a film student, I have a different theory for how this film is going to go.  I don’t think people are going to like this, but I don’t think this film is going to be shown with a reliable narrator. Mike isn’t a reliable narrator. Steve/William isn’t going to be a reliable narrator.   Best bet…we will have the rug ripped out from under us by Act 2. This film will be balancing the slasher with the psychological thriller.
HFJONE NOW
Google meet sponsor what
STOP SOLVING EVERYTHING IT HASN’T EVEN CAME OUT YET
it is gregry
in under 24 hrs this video became #1 on trending
I think the only reason MatPat* wasn't included in the film was so he could create theories unfettered.
If Blumhouse is gonna make actual animatronics for all the movies, I really want to see one centered around FNaF 4 just to see the Nightmares IRL. I feel like they’d be scary but super cool!
Steve raglan ❌ Dave Miller🟩
Wasn’t there a puppet, can’t the striped boy be the puppet—
Day 5 of asking you at make a game theory video of the roblox game Jim’s Computer
I love the FNAF lore driving Matt crazy. I would love to see how much he could get out of Homestuck and the dead timelines theory.
I think golden Freddy will put Abby in the clown animatronic because he wants to spend more time with his sister/ and this way they have all the time in the world also good vid your always nailing thing I’m sure you got a lot right!
What if that kid is the puppet?? Because of the strips
I still think Michael and William are related. It’s such an integral part of the whole story that I don’t think they could work around it without deviating to much from the original story
Bro the striped shirt kid is the crying child, they're setting up the second film
Or the kid in the stripped shirt is the puppet??
Am I the onlyone who saw the 5th Kid with the Striped Shirt and Blue Pants and thought that it is not the Cupcake but the Crying Child? It is wearing the same clothes!
The way I viewed the trailer was a little different. I know they are trying to stay away from the games a little bit, but I still don’t trust Vanessa. I think her saying “they want to make her like them” was her redirecting Mike to turn on the animatronics. Instead, I think that the animatronics want to protect Abby from Mike (because he looks like his dad and all that) so she DOES NOT become like them. I think Lillard is still playing Purple Guy like we all suspected and he’s kidnapping his son after a divorce. He did have two sons and a daughter in the games, after all.
I think that Mike will get arrested for the murders at the end. FNAF 1 newspaper clippings said a suspect was arrested. I think Mike will take the fall in either Afton’s absence (being he gets Springtrapped in this film) or at Afton/Vanessa’s behest. I think THAT will be the twist ending, leaving Abby’s fate unknown.
i’ve lived in nebraska since i came out of my mom so this is absolutely fantastic if nebraska is canon 😝🤞
Matpat, you've got to stop solving things before they even come out. You literally solved the entire movie (probably HOURS worth) with no more than 5 minutes of TRAILERS.
*me with a nokia* ok... how tf do I get google meet
The kid with the striped shirt is crying child cus he was said to haunt the location. BUT THATS JUST A THEORY! A FILM THEORY! THANKS FOR READING!
Wait a minute, the movie comes out October 27th, I plan to go on my birthday on October 28th, I live in Raleigh NC like MatPat...  *Is it possible I could meet MatPat at the FNAF movie on my birthday?!!* 😳
yay
Matpat is gonna make the movie be delayed again cuz he guessed it 😂
So, the movie reminds us that this is the US by dropping a state name, Venessa is now a fully-fledged police officer instead of private security, yet she _still_ doesn't show up with a Benelli M4?
i've gone through a lot in the past 2 years or so, and something about this movie coming out is kind of healing for my inner child. so i guess thank you, to game theory, for being with me through it all
ITS NOT OUT?
The Springtrap shots are truly terrifying ewwg
day 2 of asking matpat for a theory on last kids on earth.  matpat. DO A THEORY ON LAST KIDS ON EARTH!WATCH THE SHOW THEN READ THE BOOK IN THAT ORDER THE PIECES WILL ALIGN IN A WAY MORE COMPLICATED THAN FNAF. AND THATS A CHALLANGE!  😈
Fun fact Universal Studios Halloween horror nights has a Blum House museum this year, and there they show a special trailer of the movie at a show and they give some insider information about the film, they told us that the movie is going to cover the first three games in the franchise!
Notice that the last kid has a grey striped shirt and blue jeans. It’s Kris from Deltarune
18:31 / 19:10
well this theorist is not really fully right this time.
Dog the movie didn’t even come out yet 😂
No one is safe from matpat it isnt Even out yet and he solved it
Not scary enough
The 4th channel should have been fnaf theory.
5th child could be the protector puppet no?
CORRRY IN THE FILM THEORY VIDEOO LETS GOOO
so if william afton is michael afton's father and michael afton is mike smidth, but mike smidth's father is not afton then who really is afton. does this also mean that elizabeth and the youngest afton don't exist, because those are michael afton's siblings. is mike smidth then an other character because he has a different family than michael afton?  This confuses me...
So the ending of this movie is basically William Afton becoming Springtrap and Abby becoming Baby. This could very well lead into a sequel that’s meant to parallel Sister location. Mike could go looking for his sister’s animatronic, who’s hiding in a Sister Location of Freddy’s and meet the new possessed animatronics, which could become Ennard and scoop him to escape. He could survive just like in the games, then they could make the third one (if it’s going to be a trilogy, the last one) FNAF pizzeria simulator, where Mike gathers all the animatronic leftovers in a trap pizzeria to burn them all down.
Please make a theory on the Netflix show disenchantment
honestly just make a “FNAF Theorists” channel at this point hahaha
The movie hasn’t even come out, yet I still feel that I got spoiled
Bro solved the fnaf movie before it came out
Let me rott matpat's theory :) there is adult Abby in the cast.
I've never played a FNAF game.
I'm from Nebraska man.
Wouldn’t it make more sense for the Cupcake to be Suzie’s dog? She was lured to her death because Afton killed her dog. Chica sticks with her cupcake, and appears to be able to control it. It doesn’t make much sense to just come up with a new child murdered just to fill in a small animatronic role like that.
14:13 dream theory confirmed
You guys should do a theory on monument mythos A LOT has changed since you last saw it
My theory for golden freddy: the bite of 83 did happen, if mike is mike, abby is baby(elizabeth) and there is afton, then mikes bro was the cryign child, and for chuld version of mike was to show the bite of 83 actually happening
😮
Flintstones being in the future would be a great one
I realy dont think the kid is cupcake i think he is crying child look at hus shirt
Has anybody seen Shane Acker's 9 movie? We need a theory on that!! It has so much lore.
when are we getting another transformers theory?
The striped shirt on the last kid screams Puppet!!
Interesting, though the child that doesn't have characteristics of any of the animatronics also is wearing a striped shirt... the twist could be that child is actually another character that wears stripes... The Puppet. We'll just have to see what it turns out to actually be, but that's my theory.
Please solve the lore of Top Chess! We need to know when the Ultimate Pawn will come!
I-it isn't even out...
@thefilmtheorists i think the kid is supposed to be the crying child cause of the stripes on his shirt. oh yh and abby could be puppet.
Matpat ,if you can't figure out a comedy series about killer robots and not anger the fandom. Then I don't expect you to figure out a HORROR series about killer robots and not anger a fandom.
How do you stuff a kid in a cup cake
Qick thought Could the 5th kid be puppet or something cuz he has a stripped shirt on
Hold up there MatPrat the cupcake theory is good. However that fifth kid DOES have a characteristic. A striped shirt. That must be EVAN
So what about puppet
yo ngl you should try to make a madness combat theory (idk wat it would be about tho)
MatPat eating pizza in the diner with Ollie at the end of the movie, or even the beginning  would've been the best twist in history
Bros...has anyone else came up with the theory that remnant/agony is a stand in for the conspiracy, adrenochrome? 0_o Think about it.
It is so wild hearing MatPat explain a FNAF thing to an audience that isn’t saturated by the franchise. He stopped to clarify who Baby is!
Google meat
Imagine the movie gets postponed again because Mat Nailed it
What I noticed is that the picture that’s been drawn of the five kids with the Springtrap Bonnie suit, roughly mirrors the kids that Mike sees in the woods.
Little brother getting fired for that comment
The 5th kid is dressed kinda like crying chilg
Dude literally leaked the entire plot of the film
I think that the cupcake is not the 5th spirit, it is cassidy- golden Freddy and golden freddy has 2 spirits like the game
Mat what did you do
the amount of movie, game,food and fashion knowledge in his brain is just crazy
You couldn’t even wait for the full release…
The fifth kid had the shirt of the crying child
Hey Matpat it you wanna do a fnaf theory on style theory you could make a theory if the design for the remnant extractor is the best it could be
The movie suddenly doesn't feel that scary to me
I think the child you said would be the cupcake is actually the crying child. He has a striped shirt on...
I still don't get why they made Bonnie BLUE
Next thing universal cancels the movie until 2030
Finally, it spreads to the other channels
I kind of wish that they made FNAF a live action series, don't you?
Literally me who had thought of all these parallels weeks before...
Thisis why I love MatPat.
I'd say its like the golden freddy in the games, two children, two spirits
genius
Lucas is this film's Tom Holland 😂
That remnant extractor is a freddy head
Matpat is to smart
CORY MENTIONED 🙌🙌🙌⚔️
wow William afton kindnapped his son which was mikes Brother And mike is Williams son aswell And williaam in springtrap
I DID IT BEFORE YOU
Spoilers right ahead.
i'm happy that there will be a movie but i wish it was the lore
That thumbnail goes so hard...
Isnt the fifth kid going to be the puppet based on his striped shirt. Not great evidence but better than cupcake
Bro matpat you gotta work on this format. I skipped to 7 minutes on accident and it felt like the beginning of the video and I missed nothing.
I feel like this movie could follow the core of the book, im pretty sure at least in the 1st one the character Carlton finds out that Charlie’s dad worked with “Dave” aka afton, I think that also plausibly explains why afton would’ve taken mikes brother and also could explain why it just says “mikes dad” and it be a different actor than William
So is sammy real or what and if yes what happened to sammy
I remember watching Mark back in 2014 screaming at a 2D-Panoramic Horror game. Times change, man...
By the time the third movie comes out...Lets all be 100% real here, we'll be in our 60's.
8:20 he makes it sound like Matthew Lillard was kidnapping the kid.
Idk about y’all, but I’m buying that cookbook
imagine getting killed and being like 'well at least I get to be a huge scary animatronic' ...and then you become the cupcake 🤣
Can’t believe matpat missed the fact that the 5th kid had a striped shirt, like the crying child
My theory: VANESSA is the twist villain working for Raglan/Afton. Evidence? She's wearing yellow and shows up out of nowhere for exposition purposes. (Also the obvious Vanny thing in the games, but that's TOO easy.)
So you're saying that the last CID is the sole of the cupcake but how does the body fit in the little thing 🤔
In the fnaf novel the fourth closet, circus baby opens her faceplates and there are saw like tools
It reminds me of baby’s claw face thing in the silver eyes trilogy 2:44
‘Solved’ for the 100th time
What if Mike, Abby and Vanessa got on the animatronic’s side, they help them out and that’s when their souls leave the suit to torment William. He goes into the back room where he is spring-locked? Also, what if the person who plays as mike’s dad IS William Afton but just younger, William disappears after kidnapping his brother and is unrecognisable by Mike and Vanessa.
Wait why was this reuploaded?
Thanks for google meat for sponsoring this part of the video
Love you're videos Keep up the great work mat!
I still don't understand why the animatronics would want to hurt and stuff another kid? Aren't they only aggressive towards adults? Why would they want to make another innocent kid suffer like them. If this was the games, I would guess that they've mistaken Mike for William and want to hurt anyone close to their murderer including his little sister, but since they've seemed to cut out Mike being William's son and looking just like him...
1:17 really made me feel old af
Love the fact that Fnaf has beene xtended to the Film theory channel
Here I thought having Google meet on the phone was as obvious as having SMS.
Spring trap isnt spring trap yet hes spring bonnie
Yeah, but the kid literally has the same shirt as the kid that got bit in 93.
Nah Bro the Kid with the striped sweater is the puppet because the twist is that they can't put the spirits to rest the puppet can. Though this would change the lore a bit
I WANT FNAF COOK BOOK
A Filmtheory about the Movie?!? You all know what that means…. Now Scott needs to produce more Movies to change and advance the filmLOOOOOORE to keep Mat confused😭
15:15 aside from the tears, he lines up quite a bit with the Puppet.
Heckin google sponsoring you now-
Here is my secret…                                                  …dont click cuz it did not intrest me
Idk about the kid in the striped shirt…I think they want us to to think he’s the Crying Child but I see where people think he’s Cupcake. Idk yet, we’ll see.
dang that jumpscare in the beginning got me 😱
Scott: OH CMON NOT AGIAN **cancells movie**
I think matpat is close but I think there will be one more twist in the movie. I don’t think the studios will want to portray 5 killed children as evil spirits for the general audience. So the animatronics are ACTUALLY trying to keep Mike and Abby away from Vanessa. And in the end SHE will be the one to force Abby into the baby costume. They will go the Vanessa working with William storyline.
They have to play the first fnaf song during the credits
Scott is going to watch this and have this entire film reeditted
There will not be any lore in this film because it's an adaptation meant for general audiences. You're wasting time for cheap clicks because you know FNAF is the most-popular way of getting views.
wait, only a portion sponsored?
😧😯😢😈😤😩
there is no way that fnaf just kidnapped 2 channels
I use google meet in English class
Maybe mike’s father is William just saying Cause we need someone to be afton
could the striped shirt kid be the puppet?
I am going to say, why is balloon boy on the wall of drawings, if balloon boy was introduced after fnaf 1?
Mat pat you should do Spidey and his amazing friends because I can't understand the it
I’ll watch the fnaf movie coz i wanna see more of Josh Hutcherson in action. He’s a good actor and I’ve only seen him in a few movies.
Matpat: *sponsoring google meet* Me: wait a minute doesnt goggle meet have the exact colors of team theorists the green is game theory, red is film theory, yellow is food theory and blue is style theory!
STOP SAYING MEAT! 9:00
The fifth kid is the puppet, striped shirt, it's so obvious
He actually got sponsored by a Google division wow
the 5th kid looks like crying child
Can you do a Naruto theory
Hey just wanted to point out that the kid you say could be the cupcake is wearing a striped shirt like the crying child or possibly could  mean he is the puppet just wanted to point it out if you had missed it :)
He forgot the fazbear freight 1 into the pit
It's not even October yet..
Can u do skibidi toilet
First FNAF video on the Film Channel! With so many iconic video games becoming films, the switch around is a little odd. Though definitely welcome!
I still think that Matt is wrong about the kids we see, not in that they are the missing children, but who is who, specifically the Freddy’s I think the kid inna brown shirt is regular Freddy’s dn the kid with top hat and “yellow” shirt is G. Freddy
i think i solved fnafs problem with the mask or the remnant execrator if you think about it in fnaf 1 when you die your eyes start poking out meaning you have been stuffed in a animatronic but they thought you were the endo skeleton so they wouldnt stuff an endoskeleton inside you meaning it can be the remnant extractor which would make sense if babies pizza world was build while fnaf 1 pizzeria was open (because as matpats theory presents abby might become baby so William already made the animatronics)
I have great songs on my channel ❤.
If this gonna happend im gonna scream its amazing
Ngl this is one of those times where I hope he’s wrong, I don’t want no time travelling spoilers😢
WHY DOES THIS HAVE 2 MILLION VIEWS ALREADY
dawg how do you get sponsored by google meet 💀
REMNANT????
it didnt come out
I thought it was obvious that mike was going to be in the Freddy suit
Scott:      Ffs.
Imagine if the cupcake is Susie's dog
Wouldn't it be interesting if they made Mike's dad the movie equivalent of Henry
MatPat please, the movie hasn’t even been released yet and you solved it ? 😭 What do you know that we don’t ? 👀
1,412 dislikes wow
Fnaf 1 takes place in the 1990's and Security breach takes place in 2035. Vannesa is 60+ years old in security breach confirmed
matpat is the type of guy that solves a movie that didnt even come out yet
You'd be surprised with the nebraska thing
You fool! The blonde kid has a missing eye, just like Golden Freddy. That kid IS Golden Freddy, he has an special characteristic.
Bro solved the movie before it’s even out 💀
My man solved the movie before it even launched 💀
I dont understand how so many people dont understand the “remnant extractor” is clearly the mask, fhe costume that phone guy mentions, it even has eye holes for the endo skeleton, im not gonna say matpat is wrong but from the beginning thats whag i thought it was, clearly this isnt micheal, its someone else, a previous night gaurd that didnt escape, got caught and i being put in a suit
At first I was kind of disappointed seeing that the trailer was going in a very different direction, not committing to the books or the games fully but man your video got me excited!!!  I still do think the Charlie story would make for a great movie but if your right about this one Matpat I am def SEATED...
but, that last child in the forest... that looks like the crying child
I hope you injoy.
15:16 Couldn't the kid with the striped shirt also be the puppet?
17:23 G.Freddy has one eye, so presumably he’s only got one spirit in him rn
Oh no, fnaf has invaded film theory
Scott cawthon(after matpat's video): *proceeds to delay the movie 99 extra years*
Cant believe they are making a movie about my favourite lemon demon song
Create a lazytown lore matpat I need you
Mattypatty there's more salad fingers eoisodes now😊😊😊😊
I'm more concerned about the fifth kid having a striped shirt..
A short 6 hour presentation :>
Hi matpat it might be a little late and u might not see this but could you pleeeeeeeeaaase do a good omens theory  their are sooo many theory’s some better than other but I strongly believe ur the ONLY one that can do a true theory (if u need inspo two really popular theory’s are the coffee theory and the liar theory)
"i sovled the fnaf movie 2" the next quote
15:20 the striped shirt made me think of Crying Child
I spent 3 days just watching your fnaf movies
I think that is puppit
14:58 this kid. the kid with brown/blonde hair, A striped shirt, And Blue pants? Who could that be? its likely not Gregory. As gregory was introduced into the franchise later on. I think this kid might be. The Crying Child. Or maybe im wrong idk
You gotta be Popular af to get sponsored by google, Not to mention I recalll them getting sponsored by google before.
What if Chica wasn't "the first" but it was the cupcake all along, it was the one that has "seen everything" 🤯.
I figured striped shirt kid will be Puppet
I am SO GLAD he mentioned "Time Traveling" when Abby sunk into the ball pit, because she might ACTUALLY time travel to Freddy Fazbear's 1985 like how Oswald did in the fnaf book, "Into the Pit". I've been going CRAZY over that scene in the trailer lol
@15:04 same shirt, same pants and same hair as crying child. Knowing how significant a shirt and hair colors are in this franchise, I don't think that the 5th child fits the role of cupcake.
Lucas Grant is SWEATING rn
imagine the animatronics beating up william lol
So, i believe its your channels ranting and everything where you had all the lore laid out.... you know where you highlighted a comment i made about willys wonderland being a sequel to fnaf and got flamed so hard because everyone thought I was dumb and lost in the lote...... huh lets see william is a psychiatrist, goes by dave, where willy is was his final suit..... hmm
9:53 What about discord BRO ?! xD
If the bite of 87 won't be in the movie I'm gonna cry
Oh gosh yes~ they did it ^^ they commented remnant!
As much as i want to watch this video, im going to dodge it incase of spoilers knowing your accuracy 😂
Make a video on filthy Frank show plsss
Jit tripping, the movie has not come out yet
I reckon that abby is dead and mikes hallucinating her
Can't wait for "Cooking with Freddy" and "FNAF:Dress Up Adventure" to absolutely ruin your life.
This is my favourite theory that you've made
Blud just spoiled the whole film
14:00 I personally think that Mike becomes Golden Freddy and Abby knows.  That's why she's so calm around him and holding his hand.  Plus, Chekov's Comment when Mike tells Abby to "hold his hand" 🙂
I'm calling it early, there's going to be a trilogy
MAKE LOREE 0N SHADOW FREDDY AND GOLDEN FREDDY PLS
question for matpat. I think cupcake kid has c,c shirt.
When you clearly have seen the film already but still wanna make content "without" spoiling it "it's just a theory a film theory"
i'm not a fan of josh hutcherson. he's a less attractive penn badgley
You should REALLY make a theory on Boungou stray dogs
Wait, they got Peeta for a FnaF movie? That's just merging 2010's nostalgia
Y’all want chips? Or cheesy ramen?
A suspiciouly mat pat shaped rookie  showing up to the scene of a burnt down freddy fazbears and saying "i have a theroy"
Fun fact i played every fnaf game after watching mat pats videos
Thank you for creeping us out... about Google Meet.
Matpat Make A Theory On The Loops
Please do a film theory on the Twisted Metal TV show!!
dawg the movie isn’t out yet
I need more google meat…
Do you Think There Will FNAF Movie 2 Like The Game FNAF 2 Or the other FNAF Game FNAF 1 to Security Breach but It Just My Theory
as someone who was only listening to the video and only kinda paying attention, I was REALLY curious what kind of service Google Meat offered
Yk abay is a character from Fazbear frights
15:26 or it could be the crying child from the fnaf 4 mini game but I had read all the fnaf books so this could be bigger than what we all expected from the franchise so this could also be the puppet ghost kid because the fnaf lore for the movie is really confusing or be the next step for the whole games and movies that we will be supposed
Hm.. if Garrett was Golden Freddy, it would make PERFECT sense. "Why?", you ask?  *I T ' S  M E .*  Goldie's iconic and mysterious phrase that's used EVERY time they appear. It's still not entirely certain what the phrase means in the story, but the general consensus is that because Crying Child is Michael's brother, that half of Goldie's soul is calling out to *his* brother.  ..if Garrett is Crying Child, this phrase works just as effectively. The only question that remains now is..  If Garrett is there.. where is *SHE?*  *The One He Shouldn't Have Killed.*
Nice 🐰🐻🐤🦊
i like to think that the kid at 15:18 is the crying child. 1 because of his stripped shirt. 2. well i dont really know about the hair but, it kinda makes sense, well to me at least.
But for me the 5th kid is puppet because liok at the clothes
Your scripting is usually so flawless
I think it would be interesting to do a how to survive the H5G9 virus from Sweet Tooth.
It hasn’t even been released and he is on it ! THIS is GRINDING
do one about sounds of nightmare
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE CUPCAKE as well. I knew because when you showed us the poster earlier in the video i thought “why is the cupcakes eyes red?” Then i thought is he the fifth kid or the 6th. Also knew because the cupcake attacked on its own
Does anyone think the kid without a prop looks like crying child?  Just a thought
I predict that Vanessa knows so much about the pizzeria because of some time travel plot. We know it’s possible from the ball pit. I think after Security Breach, Vanessa went back to fix everything before fnaf 2 happens. It’s probably not likely though.
Wait a second, doesn’t someone say that you’re gonna be saying I always come back
run style theory run (gets jumpscared)
Matpat I have give you enough time where is my theory in the adventures of the panda warrior starting now I will comment on every video you make waiting for my adventures of panda warrior day one
I saw a  fnaf cook book at a book fair
The fifth boys shirt is striped is it possible he's the bite victim
ehy is he stalking a child’s social media????🤔🤔🤔🤔
I THINK THAT THE 5TH KID IS THE PUPPET . The striped shirt and he's in the middle and behind the kids like he's protecting them, I think the puppet is what they want to keep away from us untill the movie airs as a big reveal
If you like scary stories then give this comment a like ☠️
What if the guy that Mike is talking on the phone with is phone guy and Acton is actually springtrap.
Matpat following child actor social media activity is definitely purple guy behaviour
What's that?! A murderer using an ALIAS?! I don't believe it! WHAT A TWIST! Who could have seen that coming? Certainly not literally everyone who saw the trailer LOL.  Also. The cupcake has literally been its own thing since forever. We've seen it act separately before, in the games- this isn't new.
Google meet just sounds like discord minus the grooming
i didnt even realize it was film theory until it was stated the like 5th time
10:11
BROS ON TRENDING TAB (at the time of commenting this)
I think the fifth boy who hasnt got any decorations is one of the souls in Golden Freddy, we know he has two souls and from the books we know that one cant see and cant do anything. Maybe thats why he hasnt got any decorations or they can switch like Golden Freddy souls can take turns on the body  After all I am still hyped to see this movie and how right MatPat was
ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET CHILL BRO
I would like to see Markiplier squaring against foxy, and shout I AM THE KING OF FREDY FAZBEAR'S
FnAF cinematic universe..
I have this odd headcanon for the cupcake in this movie. So you know how spring trap in the game lured Susie (Chica) into trusting him because he told her that her dog was alive. I don't know why, but I like the idea that the cupcake is Susie's dog.
I honestly think matpat has knocked it out of the park for this theory. This theory seems really convincing (more so than the recent theories) and I wouldn't be surprised if all or most of it is accurate
Bro matPat has gone so far he’s being sponsored by GOOGLE!
cant wait to come back to this video in a month and see how right he was
if we just take a step back, go to any point in the video, and listen to any of the theories without context about fnaf at all, matpat sounds clinically insane.
AYO SALAD FINGERS 13 IS OUT ON NEW GROUNDS
My whole that doesn't know fnaf is:😢😢😢☠️☠️☠️💀💀
Ok me being me this takes place in the late 90’s mikes car is a 1997-2002 Honda Accord so this has to take place from 97-99 that would line up with the phones mikes car isn’t the generation before it and isn’t the generation after it because the headlights and taillights are completely different it’s specifically a 1998 Honda Accord ex sedan y’all are welcome from the car scene to the fnaf scene
you shouldn't be solving it this early, you're grounded Mathias
I’m gonna almost guarantee that this theory he made is gonna be wrong
If this movie aint as bloody as banana split then it aint fnaf also the abby befriending the animatronics kinda does remind of of banana split because of the one animatronic that becomes friendly just like golden freddy in the trailer
Bro figured out the film theory before it was even an actual film 💀
I live in utah!
I think that instead of trapping him in the walls, I think they’re going to spring lock him in the end
this is why matpat wasnt casted in this movie XD
CHEESE GO HARD
hey uhm i have a question if you can. can you make a video about a game i made on scratch wholesome camp made by rein 101 (no space) but uhm my file's got corrupted
I can debunk some of this pretty easily. As a native Nebraskan, I can confirm this is not an aspirational place for anybody.
he already solved it?
i love the mark e plier reference  4:11 lol
Cookbook:  animatronic pie  Ingredients:  child's soul  Pie  Spirnglocks Garnish
15:02 i think the top hat kid is golden freddy cause his color scheme matches that one more
Bro saw a kid in a striped shirt and didn’t immediately think it was the puppet
5th kid is the puppet at Halloween horror nights it said that Freddy and the gang are made out of the same material as the puppet
Bro it’s not even out yet💀💀💀
Can’t wait to see a fnaf episode on the other 2 channels as well😂 “why the fnaf suit is impossible to get in” “why a kid head is has a lot of protein”
Intro clip never fails to satisfy
Remnant
Hmmm no Cassidy, just a boy wearing a dark striped shirt...  Suspicious.
Someone like this comment after the movie comes out so I can remember to watch this.
Matpat the cupcake kid could actually be the crying child because of the  striped shirt and blue pants
All of this seems good but the ending seems like to much and doesn't make sense
I also thought another way Abby becomes Baby is that in exchange for saving Mike and Vanessa, she allows the animatronics to put her in a suit (or the animatronics just wanna defeat Afton for revenge idk)
3:00 yes I fully understand, the strange this is that I DO completely understand
Anyone else realize that the 5th kid is wearing cloths like the crying child. Striped shirt with blue pants.
No way jose 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Also the movie is coming out on my birthday that's so cool 😮🎉
Nebraska mentioned!
Oh god, about that part where golden freddy is with abby it actually seems right for that to be evan/garret!
Look at how far we've come! What are we gonna do when there's no more fnaf? It's all ending what are we gonna do?? This sure was fun...
What I wouldn't give for Matpat to cameo in this film as a detective and conspiracy theorist that gets mauled immediately while trying to "spoil" the plot.
DID YOU JUST SPOIL AND INDEFINITELY DELAY THIS MOVIE???
Do you even read my recommendations for a stardew theory? Come on Matpat WHY JUST WHY
Matpat is always make us happy and Raise your hand if you're a og fan
14:55 the stripe shirt could indicate that the child is in fact the cupcake because of the cup or whatever you call it, or the blond hair could also mean golden Freddy
The 5th kid's shirt makes me think Marinette
I know a lot of work went into this episode but so many apparent details got overlooked. The Springbonnie suit is half decayed and half not. Almost perfectly split down the middle.
scott didn’t even get the chance to breathe and matt figured out the “lore”
Mat sweetie, please, you'll hurt yourself with how many times you say "I SOLVED-"
I thought the 5th child could be the puppet because of the stripped shirt
movie isn't even out and he's saying he's solved it 🦴🦍⛺
Idk why but now I want a book theory
how does bro solve a movie before it comes out
Springlock scene?
Mike is short for Michael and in fnaf there is a character you play as named Michael. Both characters lost their brother to something related to Freddy fazbear, and both characters applied for a nightshift at a pizzeria. Coincidence?
if you notice the remnant extractor actually looks like a mask instead
Do a treroy on bingo And Friends
That honestly makes sense because if Abby is Circus Baby and if Golden Freddy is Evan than it all connects together.
15:08 Why wouldn’t the last kid from the first trailer it be the puppet, the striped shirt? And isn’t it cannon that the puppet is alive at that time
here me out, the cupcake kid is crying child. triped shirt and blue pants that seems pretty intentional
Puppet
These kids aren’t even out for vengeance, they are out for all
I’m surprised Matpat didn’t think the 5th kid was the Crying Child due to the good old striped shirt
MatPat this is the 1337th time you have solved anything related to FNAF
Wake up super star
I love the actor for the job councilor, it would be a perfect William Afton in my opinion. A unsuspecting normal person.
So I pretty much just watch 20 mins of spoilers for the fnaf movie.... Thanks, Mat.
Can you Do one on Peppa Pig
Bro the movie isn’t even out please don’t do the lore until the movie 😢😢😢😢😢😮😮😮
Hey Matt, I normally don’t do this but I feel like I should. I just wanted to say thank you for all of what you’ve done. You have made lots of people happy with your videos, your jokes and your personality. You truly are a great person. The main reason why I am messaging you is because my cousin passed away and she was like a older sister to me. She was the one who introduced me to you with your videos, all the way back to fnaf 1. She was a huge fnaf fan and we would watch your videos together as soon as they came out. It was the best. So I wanted to say thank you for being such a positive influence in her life and mine. She may be gone but the memories will stay forever. You probably will never see this, I’m sorry for bothering you.
After this, is clearly that they're gonna delay the fricking movie, or worse, realese it and I'm not going to enjoy it 'cause MatPat has already told the whole story. Don't get me wrong, I love the videos he and his team make, but they are soooooooooo good at their job 😢  Anyways, I hope he gets most of the movie right and that there's still a twist or something that he passed on...
the theory logos are like siblings when the oldest(game theory) has relatively "finished" the lore a movie comes out for film theory to take from game theory.
Can I wait a month to watch thjs? I wanna go see the movej sithout any spoliers MATPAT! So ima wait.
Shorts wars season 2 is starting
Crying Child Moment? It would be hariourse if it was the kid.
What if someone MatPat actually made a cameo in the movie outside the trailer and kept it secret from all of us. 💀
Isn't Cassidy Golden Freddy
THE MOVIE ISNT EVEN OUT YET
WOOOO
I'd imagine that the "They want to make her like them" line is another red herring. Why would the spirits want another child to go through what they did. The characters think that's what's gonna happen, but in reality the animatronics want to protect her from ol Pop Pop Afton.
I think he’s a kid in stripes might be crying child
The fifth kid may be charlie because of his striped shirt
4:11 OmG ItS MaRKipLIeT(TM)
BRO ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET-
is it scary to think that watching this with a feel that he’s spoiling the movie 😂
Actually, I think the big twist is that fifth kid being the puppet, and here are my reasons, 1, he wearing a stripped shirt, and 2 a few months ago when the first teaser came out I started scouring the casting in IMDB and found something for "The Puppet"
He spoiled their whole movie because they didn’t put him in it lol
What i think might happen to Abby is she is gonna end up like Elizabeth with the whole ice cream thing which I think will be pretty cool
the kid is wearing stripes! everyone knows stripes is crying child!!! Hes golden freddy!
Do you take video requests? The new Goosebumps Disney+ series trailer came out and I haven't seen any theories on it yet.
2:15
Matpat solving the movie before it came out 🗿
man the 2nd trailer probobly did all it needed to do (just watch it the 2nd trailer it spoils it all)
google drive and the apps that branch off of it are the best and my personal go to
Matpat, I gotta give it to you. Your dedication to this franchise is impeccable. Thank you for your beloved theories over all these years.
YES, ITS #1 ON TRENDING 🎉
The last kid is probably marionette because of the stripes
Matpat is probably the most insane big Youtuber out there, and I love him so much for it.
He's shirt is like the puppets arms and legs
Eyes blue That the crime child cries
i dont really like style theory, it also didnt have that big grand opening like food theory did, it kinda just showed up. i feel like they should have done something else, like books, music, or media hoaxes.
I think that he is not the cupcake i think he is the puppet
Bro it's not out yet 💀💀
its not even out yet
Ur gonna delay the movie
Imagine If this doesn’t get published because he was actually right.
I think it's another movie made by fazbear  to make light of the events  of what happened, like how the vr games were supposed to be
Prediction: MatPat is in the movie and still got it wrong.
I *had* always wondered if the Cupcake ever got possessed
Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me - John 14:6. I felt led to share this with you all 🥰
It would be cool if the movie ended with William Afton being crushed and thought dead, then and end credit could be that it shows the bloody springtrap suit move. Also it would be cool if the song that plays during the credits is the song the Living Tombstone made
bro let the directors chill you makin them tweak it aint even out yet😭💀
The one guy that uses zoom…
that dude who signed for 3 movies could also just be phone guy or the movie’s equivalent. Wouldnt be ideal but would also make sense
15:21 The kiddo has the stripped shirt. Just sayin.
My theory is that Mike doesn't escape the death trap and instead becomes Golden Freddy - hence why the star-powered actor doesn't appear in the title card with Abby and instead is replaced by Golden Freddy.
So Garrett is the alt version of Gregory then?
Ding fries are done
no.
AWSOME
Mat possibly just figured out the whole movie before it came out💀💀
The child who was said to be the cupcake. I thought it was kinda strange that he looks a bit like the vengeful spirit from custom night. I just thought it was funny
here is a theory what kind of animatronic would mat pat become
“The test isn’t that confusing” The test:
4:39 I'm sorry but matpat debating whether fnaf takes place in Nebraska or Utah is hilarious. There's something just so mundane about those two states that just adds so much to this franchise.
What if Matthew Lillard's character is Phone Guy? They have to have Phone Guy for a FNAF 1 movie! Then he does turn out to be the killer, thus making the original Phone Guy is the killer theory true!
It's weird I've never played any of them yet I'm invested in your videos. Sunk cost I guess?
I always thought it was the crying child because kid the striped shirt and being pictured with the animatronics while also not having a definitive role
Ngl, idk how they're planning 3 of these. I dont see the first one doing well
Hey he predicted the Mario movie almost perfectly so why not the fnaf movie
If they make a restaurant and a clothing brand mat pat is done for
Mat the movie aint even come out yet☠️
what about the markiplier cameo?
7:56 bro my name is Garrett too, if I get kidnapped in the woods bro 😭
16:41 that can’t be bc I hear and saw from ppl Scott wants the movie to be connected to the games not the books
BRO THE MOVIE HASN’T EVEN COME OUT YET 😭  Me when I live in Louisiana and literally went to New Orleans not long after they finished filming and didn’t see the set: 😔
I like how I grew up learning all the intricacies of fnaf lore without ever playing the games
I still have a theory, based on how the cupcake attacked, that the cupcake is possessed by Suzy's dog. That's how afton lured her in the games. Assuming that's the same here, he killed her dog. And the dog wanted to stay with her and possessed the cupcake. Attacking at Suzy's command like someone sicing a dog on someone.
My theory was maybe Mike was going to get got by Afton and he was going to end up in the Golden Freddy suit. But this is also good.
Is it just me or does the 'old school' example in the video look like Markiplier's features??? time stamp 4:05. Come on I can't be the only one here right????
have you done series of unfortunate events? cuz you should it's LORE FILLED
1:28 the Fnaf music videos too ( that was apart of my child hood )
“Meet”
Matt.....            Congratulations or maybe not?
Perhaps worth mentioning that the fifth mystery kid is wearing a shirt with horizontal stripes not unlike the design of the puppet?
Bro solved something without it even coming out yet
Cupcake looks like it has stripes on its wrapper (I know it's not striped, but the shadow makes it looked striped) kid is wearing stripes.  Checks out.
3 minute ad is crazy
Anyone else noticed the last child matpat said was the "cupcake" was wearing a STRIPED SHIRT!!!
het apple
whoa whoa whoa!!! slow down there. MatPat has a kid?
My dad watched this video and he is so confused,he only likes film not game theory😂
15:07 the kid could also be the puppet. Look at the shirt.
Film theory is finally talking about the FNAF movie!!!!!
If the movie gets delayed for a future date, then MatPat was right.
Nah my middle school just had a book fair and they had that cookbook 💀
I think the 5th child in the striped shirt is going to be marionette
FNAF has made it to film theory, who would’ve thought
What if the fifth unknown child in the scene  where we see all the children is the crying child. The fifth kid's shirt and pants match the crying child's.
As a nebraksan, i can confidently say: DONT GO TO NEBRASKA MIKE! ITS WORSE THAN OHIO!!!
Maybe the puppet is in the moive
Why the FRICK FRAK FNAF did I not know the mat pat had a mini mat pat (his kid)
I have a theory, what if the guy who offered the job ISN’T William Afton, but just an everyday guy who KNOWS about the animatronics and gives a human sacrafice instead. If any one knows some FNaF lore, they’d know Afton was attacked after killing the 5 kids and entered the Spring Bonnie suit to try to blend in but dies because of the spring locks. I think Mike’s FATHER IS the real Afton and now possesses the Bonnie suit trying to hide the secrets from Abby, Vanessa, and his own son. He DID always say “ I ALWAYS COME BACK “.
Make a theory for  coraline
Technically, at 12:06-ish, it's burglary, not robbery. I'm too lazy to read if anyone else already said this.
Thanks for spoiling the entire movie MatPat you did once again😂
Remant extractor? Yeah sorry Mat, this is just something to get general horror fans interested. There's no WAY the FIRST movie is deving into sister location. I say this is a movie retelling of the OG game plus Springtrap. Like the original novel trilogy, it's a retelling in a different universe
Fun fact: During one of the scenes with springtrap you can see skin
Maybe
Man got jumped by a cupcake
(waste of time post ig) Idk man, maybe the kid isn't the cupcake, maybe he's Cassidy, co-possessing G.F. like in the games, but then again it feels very random cuz isn't Cassidy supposed to be special in someway feels weird not giving them anything special yk? But it does feel weird having the 5th kid as the cupcake.
The cupcake attacking people could just be creative license…  MatPat: I think William Afton managed to fit a whole child into a cupcake robot the size of a watermelon.
Surprised he dosent know that fnaf movie is Scott's last ever creation do some research and it will say this is true 😢😢😢😢
15:06 - STRIPED SHIRT STRIPED SHIRT!!! THE STRIPES HAVE STRIKED AGAIN!!!  17:45 - idk if it’s just me or on the very right u can see what looks like Abby in the back🤷
do a fnaf 4 way culab
bro tryna spoil the movie before it comes out
Bro just spoiled the whole movie before it came out
This is #5 on trending!
The kid with the stripped shirt could be the crying child or the puppet
It’d be awesome if they like trigger his springlocks to defeat afton and you can hear him scream when he’s trapped within the walls
BRO GOT GOOGLE SPONSORING HIM NOW CONGRATS
Is the fnaf movie for kids only reply
Markiplier is golden freddy trust
Congrats on #1 on trending bro
This is why you aren't in the movie
the 5th kid that was said to be the cupcake matches the crying child really well in terms of clothing
SHUT UPP! I WANT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE
FAITH THE UMHOLY TRINITY FOR GAME THEORY
I am beyond hyped. i know some people re write their game because Mat has figured it out "cough hello neighbor cough* even if this turns into a spoiler Im still gonna be just as amazed at the ending had I not seen this. It all comes down to how right our boy here is
2:03 is a game of thrones reference right tats what Ramsay said to Theon
now hear me out but what if the 5th kid is the puppet or the marionette 🤔
Film Theory request: how much force does it need to move the earth in space like they did in Wondering Earth.
I'm suing this man i just heard the whole movie 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Respectfully not watching yet
Ima summarize the entire fnaf lore because fnaf is a pretty easy series to understand the lore in, In summary, EVIL FURRY KILLER KILLS AND TURNS THE KIDS HE KILLS INTO ROBO-FURRYS ez.
I feel like I haven’t seen anyone mention this, but on the fallen sign that says Closed, you can see there are 5 letters, CLOSE, with the O highlighted in red (Golden Freddy) while the D is the only one pushed off to the side (the Puppet). I guess it’s not that important, but I thought it was a nice little detail. Granted maybe I’m just slow and everyone else saw it, thus why nobody’s pointed it out yet.
Can you please make a vid about the whole fnaf lore but without any of your theory’s . Just the original one
Post credit scene: after Afton inside the golden bonnie suit is defeated/killed/locked/hides in a room the camera pans in on the room and shows him doing THE scene in which his suit locks up, the camera zooms out of the room and just shows the door as we hear him laugh and then the suit locking up as he screams
I have a small feeling that Vanessa might be a plot villian. Maybe she is there to gain Mike's trust, and since it's known that she is a pawn in the games, maybe she is watching over him for William.
Oh, you don't have to sell me Meet. My immediate family has used it since Duo since its the easiest for us to use to keep in touch since we have androids and iOS lol
After the pandemic, I don't need a reminder that Google Meet is awesome, lol 😅
I’m going to save this for AFTER the movie releases so I won’t be possibly spoiled lol
Just delete YouTube/ticktock/facebook/twitter/ any social media and now tv
I thought the cupcake was a dog, like Susie’s dog. I don’t know.
I don't feel like that one extra kid would be the cupcake, his shirt looks like the puppet's design and (given the lore isn't too different) I'd assume as such the puppet is involved.
Wait he got more siblings 😳
Have you looked at UCN office 1?
Also, I do think that Steve Raglan/William will actually be revealed as Mikes REAL father and that the father who was cast wasn't his biological father, would be an amazing twist
FINALLY A FNAF
The box… FNaF 4 box
CORYXKENSHIN !!!!!! 🤗🤗🤗
Orrrr.... Hear me out, they pull the whole Silver Eyes Trilogy Trick on us and Mike is a robot all along and the golden freddy iss the real Mike Schmidt who was killed all those years ago and now possesses the animatronic and that's why he befriends Abby... Silly but wouldn't be the first neither the last time lol
Imagine Google Meet involved in FNAF lore
#1 on trending
MatPat: “Oh my sweet stars what have I done.” Me: 🤣
Day 1 of asking Film theory to do a theory on OTGW.
If they make a movie about gregory inside the pizzaplex from security breach and IF THEY GO INSIDE THE DAYCARE IF SUN AND MOON ARE NOT THEIR AMMA JUST BE RAGEING AT THE MOVIE IF THEIR IS ONE
Fifth kids shirt the shiiiirrrtttt it the crying child/gregory shirt
Matt is it possible the puppet being leaked to be in the movie is the one kid in that one scene with the kids running from mike, they was wearing stripes on their shirt like the puppet is represented with all the time?
MatPat you should make BFDI theory! Many people have been asking for one, including myself.
If this movie gets delayed I'm blaming
Blumhouse’s iteration of the FNAF universe is already starting to look very promising. Can’t wait to see their versions of FNAF 2 and 3.
Matpat should make a theory on in the tall grass
For a generation my disciples have toiled...
8:15 Ima call DAVE I've literally never called William Afton Dave Miller before but now he's DAVE!
What matpat lore did i miss that he had a child
seeing fnaf on the film theorists channel has been a dream of mine
this is pretty good
I know it just AINT POSSIBLE that bro went through the actor’s instagram to find out the plot of the movie.
matpat after realizing he missed an opportunity to say "its been so long" at the very beginning of the video
I have a feeling that dead by daylight might key word Might get a new killer and survivor added😶
I can’t wait to see the spring lock failure scene
So does matpat still do M.O.R.T.Y.? Because I’d love to see a video on the anime “demon slayer.” Early on in the show, the main character tanjiro has to cut a boulder in half with a katana in order to enter final selection. I want to know, could you actually cut a giant boulder in half with a katana? Also yes I know my comment has nothing to do with the video. And yes I am a Fnaf fan.
I have my own theory on what the Freddy head torture device is, I don’t think William was the one who built it, I think that the animatronics made the device so they could use it on William so that he would go through the same (if not the worse) pain that they had gone through. And though I could be wrong I think it would be really cool if that’s the case.
He's solved itttt!!
Gonna predict spring trap vs golden Freddy
I’m sort of ashamed of Scott not making sure Matt is referenced in the movie in some way :(. He’s just as big of a part of the community as every other fnaf YouTuber referenced
I think the Puppet is going to get a big role in the movie. We know they’ve been cast according to imdb and we know in the games that the only reason the og animatronics are possessed is the Puppet giving gifts and giving life. I wonder if they have something to do with the fact that the animatronics want to make Abby “like them”. Perhaps blumhouse hasn’t put them in any trailers to make sure their role is a big reveal
POV the movie get delayed like doors updates
Imagine your soul being transferred into an animatronic and you find out youre a cupcake, lowkey id be kind of upset 😂
Is nobody gonna mention the fact that he got sponsored by a google product INSIDE of another google product?
I swear he's way too early
FNaF will hit all channels, we have to run while we still have time before,,, AHHHHHHH
It would be an actual crime against theory if MatPat doesn't even get a missing poster in the movie [for solving the entire movie, get it?]
Let's go
Fact was fun fact I met Lawson is crying trials it’s not real it’s just fake and in whatever his name is called Michael Hair in Michael’s head been playing with him then after that anyways do you know those teeth in there every robbery teeth in Fred Bear so yeah I’m really smart
Congrats on #1 on trending :)
HERE ME OUT BEEN A THEORIST FOR A BIT. i think the kid might be puppet or some call back the crying child. look at his shirt
Alright! Coming back in a month to see what we got!
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Matpat not being in this movie is a crime against humanity
I think that the animatroniks don't want Abby to be like them because of springtrap in the movie,
Adding in that the meaning of character names tend to be indicative of fundamental traits for that character (see: Baby, Abby) Steve - of British origin, meaning "victorious". Raglan - of Welsh origin, meaning "before [the] bank shore". I wonder if we'll learn Garrett was kidnapped somewhere on the bank of a river... Afton - of Swedish/Scottish origin, meaning "afternoon, evening; Scottish river."
Is it just me, or dose the child that we say is cupcake look like the puppet?
AYO? Get that google meet money bro
Random cool thing, if you get a bunch of phones and put them all into a google meet call, you can set them around an area and use them as cameras for a good ole fashioned game of haunted pizzeria survival in real life
r u ganna be in the movie you should be in the movie that would be cool because ur the biggest fnaf person ik besides mark
I’m disappointed he didn’t say “it’s been so long” 0:14
Good for them😢
It would be cool if Abby gets clawed in
this happens the day after my b-day
Come on Mat.  The 5th kid has a stripped shirt...
Hold on that picture of the yellow bunny holding Hands with all the kids is in the book the fourth closet graphic novel Michael was coloring it page 108 and 175!!!!😱😱
IT WASN'T EVEN RELEASED YET 💀💀💀
Dear film theory please make theory about salad fingers
I think its just a regular freddy head with the movies version of springlocks
You should make a theory on Saw X when it comes out its gonna be such a good movie (comes out sep 29th btw)
I mean the cast will probably mostly make it out alive since the same exact thing happens in the silver eyes. the end of ALMOST every fnaf game, and the apparent choice to appeal more to a younger demographic. even if people in the movie die it'l probably be off screen. there will definitely be ghosts though.
Bro I looked at fifth kids shirt it matches cupcakes candle
It would be so cool if you could do a game theory on the VR games Job  Simulator and Vacation Simulator! The basic outline of the  game is that you’re the only human left alive and a bunch of these robots are showing you how ancient humans used to function. Anyway, it would be so cool if you could do a theory explaining how humans went extinct. But there is this one moment where they mention a “human uprising” which makes me think that maybe we aren’t extinct? I don’t know what I think, but it would be so cool to see you guys do a video!
This means something THIS IS important 4:47
I 100% Doubt that Mike Schmidt is Michael Afton and I also think William Isn't the one in the car with Garret But is actually Mike's Aunt. And finally Abby=Baby/Elizabeth anagram theory is just dumb they are not the same character.
The 5th kid has a stripped shirt like Evan!
If this movie won’t release on the correct date we are blaming matpat
Right on the day of my birthday, awesome.
i thought Abby was a stand-in for Cassidy.
Idk but perhaps the ambiguous kid might be a young Mike Schmidt and the twist is that Mike actually knew about it all and had returned to try and solve the mystery himself...?
the child in the striped shirt could be the puppet, not the cupcake! then the puppet’s reveal will be a cool twist :)
Pov: matpat solves something before it comes out
HOW MANY HAS HE SOLVED?!
Okay, I understand this movie is set in a different canon than the games, but what does that make the games canon? Because if we follow the second movie trailer, I assume Abby will be killed by William. But in the games canon, if Abby is Mike little sister and her name isn’t Elizabeth, than she’d be killed by Baby. Yes, that is a potential sequel, but it kind of contradicts the lines Elizabeth/Abby has in the start of sister location. “**Daddy**, why wont you let me play with her?” Well, if William is trapped in the walls, it wouldn’t make a whole lot of sense. Plus, if William isn’t her dad, then why would he have acess to the secrets of Baby? That would most likely mean Henry is actually their dad, no? Also, the “Mikes father” character could just be in a flashback, and the Job counselor is still mikes father. I don’t believe that to be true, but it is a possibility. Also, Evan died twice in the games. You told us that was a retcon and that he was originally meant to be puppet, but ended up golden Freddy. If that’s the case, he wouldn’t have been kidnapped, and that whole kidnapping scene might’ve been just a hallucination from mikes trauma of killing his brother. Where does cassidy even come into play with this? She’s supposed to be the one you should not have killed, but where is she in this movie? She plays a huge role in the franchise, why would she just be cut out? There has to be something amiss. Maybe something the trailers not showing? Plus, Cassidy is meant to be the one controlling golden Freddy. Cassidy doesn’t know Abby, let alone considers her someone that isn’t a threat. This movie is nowhere NEAR the canon of the games, so what are we trying to figure out here? The games canon or the movies canon? Sure, this could give us hints as to the games canon, but what would that really be. There no Cassidy in the movie, so one of the biggest mysteries in this franchise is not present in the movie. Really, what else is there? Evan/garrets actual name? These of course could be stand-ins, like in the last section of gumdrop angel, Hugo (or whatever his name was) was a stand-in, but that wouldn’t make tons of sense. What is there to take away from this movie and put it into the real mystery, solving FNAFs games? Also, there is literally no way Elizabeth wouldn’t be the daughter of William, meaning Mike and Evan also are canonically Williams sons. (P.S, where again did we come up with the name Elizabeth for Afton’s daughter? Like….?) CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG!
He got sponsored by google on google's own platform, wow
Cassidy is a cupcake.
people being on youtube and not encountering FNAF - yeah, the way the internet feeds people stuff they're already interested in (or things it thinks are related to what they're interested in), I can see that. people watching MatPat channels and not knowing what FNAF is tho? yeah no way.
no way 😭😭😭
scott after watching this video: "well thanks matt, now i need a new script"
The whole fusing multiple game stories in one movie is very reminiscent of Resident Evil Welcome to Racoon City
only reason matpat isnt in the movie is so he could make a theory predicting the movie
4:37 I was surprised cuz I live in Nebraska you do t really hate much about it
Guys who miss the old fanf theory
10:10PM
Okay if someone knows FNAF and expects a happy ending…they dont know FNAF, there aint ever a happy ending
Ohnly is he knew he will never solve fnaf
Wish matpat could've made it in the movie same with mark but at least Coryxkenshin is in it
New fnaf fan: Fnaf lore isn't that complicated. Matpat: Hold my top hat
Wasn't looking at the screen and recoiled from mishearing "Google Meat"
Hold on, if Abby is going to become Baby in the Sequel and you theorized Abby's brother is golden Freddy, wouldn't it be literally "Sister Location"?
Nebraska could be a location of another Freddy's location for a sequel since the 2nd game is a prequel in another Freddy's restaurant
Never thought I would see FNaF on The Film Theorists channel
Matpat: "a short six hour slideshow" 10:01
Mikes father could be young Matthew lillard
15:16 Hello, stripes on shirt Might be crying child
I think mike is gonna end up sacrificing himself either before or after defeating William turning himself into golden Freddy. The scene were the sister is holding the hand and getting in the taxi with Freddy seems like the last scene of a horror movie where mike is golden Freddy. Cause in that taxi scene where is mike?
The boy in stripes is not the cupcake, in fact may be the puppet( who is Charlie) but not the puppet. Could be puppet spirit that also controls lefty.
Wouldn't it be the puppet? The boy has a striped shirt
ITS THE INSIDE OF THE SUIT WHEN THEY TRY TO STUFF HIM
A lot of the stuff that he said would mess with the lord and does he realize there’s 2 more movies
trapping him in the walls? didnt he get springlocked THEN trapped somewhere for him to rot for years?
Plot twist: he’s got a part in the movie and just revealed the entire script
The Hug reference in FNAF movir
Matpatt b like: Haha i've figured it out! As you can see these children are all wearing outfits coorelating to color of one of the animatronics!  Likely meaning they are the children that later get stuffed into and possess those animatronics! Therefore the kid with the red shirt is foxy, the blue kid is bonnie, yellow kid is chica..... oh also the kid with the brown shirt is golden freddy and the kid with the yellow hat and yellow shirt is freddy case closed.
Considering that the remaining spirit has a striped shirt and blue pants I suspect it might be Evan Afton, William's son.
I hope it turns out that Mathew Lillard's character turns out to be mike's dad because I really want the "don't leave me here" meme to be in one of the three movies
5th kid is Balloon Boy.
Number one on trending is actually crazy
I used Google meet  on my  ps4 😂😂😂
i’m kinda sold on the cupcake being chicas dog counterpart. referencing the games, in the fruity maze mini game we see suzie (chicas dead kid counterpart) being lured by afton in the suit promising that her dog isn’t dead. i like to think that in some twisted way she got to see her dog again :,)
MatPat is probably the worlds greatest detective in another universe the way he deep dives 😬
Did you not learn from your Security Breach videos? Are you filled with such hubris that you do not care if you delay or ruin the movie so long as you can use the 20 seconds of footage we have to reveal the whole story? Your arrogance is consuming you MatPat. And it will consume FNAF.
19:24 on Fanf glitched attraction | full game walkthrough | no commentary
the art on the wall has the cupcakes eyes as blue
15:05 the crying child
The 5th child looks like the crying child with the t-shirt that he is wearing
Number 7 on trending when I saw this ❤ also please stop ruining my favourite theory’s and things ❤❤❤
When I first heard this movie was coming out, I didn't think much of it. But after a while, I realized I literally grew up on this franchise. I'd be remiss not to be a little hyped for it.
The fnaf movie comes out on October 27 which is my friend’s birthday. This guys loves fnaf. It was made for him
8:08, some more proof, Lucas grant used the 😈 emoji, a purple demon, demons are seen as evil, and guess who’s purple and evil? William Afton!
I’m not sure I’ll like this movie because, They’ve changed names and it’s gonna be sad
My only question is golden Freddy doesn’t have an endo right so how can he walk beside Abby?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Don't canno. Is stop ruining the canno event matt patt!
It hasent even came out yet 💀
MR STOKS TV HAS LORE I PROMISEEEEE
my ocd went haywire picking out the few missing words during the ad break lol but beyond that SUPER hyped to see how close you get with the movie. Also betting you have a secret cameo somewhere and your doing a killer job keeping it secret
Ok, the theory of William kidnapping Mike's brother makes A LOT of sense. Hence why Mike continues to work there after the first couple of nights probably already knowing the animatronics are evil and are there to hunt him. He is trying to free his brother from captivity of the animatronic and help Vanessa solve the mystery, which initially leaves her injured on the hospital bed leaving Mike to try and solve it all by himself (I could only presume its right before the fifth night). I couldn't see any other reason for Mike to work there even if he desperately needs the money. He just wouldn't put Abby in such position where she would also get kidnapped and stuffed into an animatronic. Either that or my comment would probably wouldn't age well lol.
He made a theory finding out everything before it came out
it comes out just about 25 days after my birthday.
that is 26 days after my b day
I think it's ridiculous how so many people are overlooking the fact that the kid with the hat in the dream sequence is wearing yellow. And knowing what I know now about the brother, he also has dark hair that fits with Garrett. The kid in the hat is the furthest back, the most detatched and is the one the most covered by Mike, that's Golden Freddy. The kid in the very front, the frontrunner wearing brown is Freddy Fazbear. For some reason I haven't seen a single person saying this, but I caught it on my very first viewing of the trailer.  Anyway, my other theory was that we're gonna have an Empire Strikes Back moment and reveal that William Afton is Mike's real father. I always found it ridiculous that in the case of Clara Afton leaving, that she wouldn't get custody of the kids. "Mike;s Father" could very well be a step-father and we just don't know about it.
sir.  SIR. THE MOVIE ISNT EVEN OUT YET. *PLEASE.*
Number 1 on YouTube trending again Matpat? Congrats.
Yalls is it just me who's watching the movie on halloween?
Can't wait for the borderland movie in 2024
Mat pats a dad? I thought he was joking for the longest , i don’t keep up enough 💀 10:22
In fnaf thoerys you can't leave for 1 second for 1 matpat talks about the animotronics then the next he says NOW YOU KNOW WHY PURPLE GUY IS A RACIST
Oh and over priced shirts
the 5th kids, the one wearing the stripped shirt? clearly the puppet.
You forgot the most important character, William Appleton
Cant wait for matpat to be extremely wrong just like every other fnaf theory
I stand by my statement, HOW CAN YOU SOLVE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT OUT YET..?!?!
im so excited for this movie my god
:D
As someone who has Google met on my phone  My friend (who has an android) love using this It is absolutely amazing
I was sort of thinking that the final kid was crying child with the stripe shirt and all but idk
Remember someone is called Abby now because why not?!
Or the kid in the center is the puppet, who gave life to the kids, which is why he's in the middle.
“I always come” Willy a
U ever think he gets the whole thing right n den da directors watch da vid n have to scrape out what he gets right?
Watch how the movie comes out then everything Matpat says is wrong…its possible not the first time
Please make another _boisvert video. He has made so many more videos, and with that are so many more questions questions
fun fact: ive been waiting for this movie for 5 years (like all of you) and its gonna release on my birthday :)
Already Matt? Really
And what about getting springlocked like isn't afton supposed to get springlocked
I think this is a really good theory, but, I have an idea for golden Freddy, the torture device used on mike looked a little like a Freddy mask. maybe that made him into golden Freddy. That would also explain why Abby and golden Freddy are seen together a lot. But your theory would also make a lot of sense. Either way keep up the great work!
Scott: oh sh hes at it again
I personally think the remnant extractor is just a more realistic scooper
Congrats on hitting #1 on Trending!! Also love Mat talking about GT like he doesn't run that channel too.😂
Bro, it's not even out. Chill Matt. I get you're excited, c,mon this is your life basically but jeez
I have a theory about why Abby went with mike wich is that it was bring you kid to work day and he had no kid but abby his sister was an option
9:01 G O O G L E  M E A T  someone add that to matpat's sus moments compilation pls
Anyone else feel like their more excited for the books than the movie?
I hope they make a series and I can't wait for the 100th fnaf episode 😂
it hasnt even come out bruhhhhh
The cupcake at the end : oh yeah little buddy I bet ya gonna click out of this video, but the second you do I will eat the living remnants outta ya
At this point im going to ship fnaf and matpat...oh wait that already exists
I thought Mathew lillard himself confirmed he was playing Purple Guy
Am I the only one drawing the connection between the child in the trailer (14:55) with the striped shirt and the crying child also with the same type of striped shirt?
1. Remnant is book theory 2. That is the phone guy being stuffed in a freddy suit  Edit: The new leak shows that he hired a babysitter as she told Abby it's dinner time and all abby was worried about was the baby sitter sitting on golden freddy
8:22 Not Matthew Lillard, Matthew Lillard's character
The 5 kid is the crying boy the son of William
Dude you forgetting things in your old age MatPat. Baby's first appearance was at the end of FNAF World. I even had to pull up your play through to prove I was right about that to my daughter. Title of video is: Return to FNAF World - Ending HINTS at FNAF 5!?! Time stamp 1:45:22  It is here we see the name baby for the first time, and then the screen goes dark and we see Baby's eyes glowing and hear her voice for the first time before she kills the "creator"   Also why can't kid i stripped shirt be the Marionette? That is who I am leaning toward the 5th kid could be. Super excited to see the movie though!
Okay my stepmom works with lillard for buisness so i'll try to get some  info on if  lillard iss afton Ill update y'all later
Yo crying child finally got a confirmed name
I feel like the movie is like if Scott had all the lore from the beginning and not started from scratch
Hey MatPat! It's good to see that, despite the time it took, you made a film theory on the FNAF Movie. I believe I have the answer to the cupcake confusion. We have known that the cupcake was separate from Chica since FNAF VR: Help Wanted. A portion of the Chica parts and service level was trying to catch the jumping, moving cupcake and put it back on the plate. The part that is more interesting is that Chica cares for this cupcakes, as if you don't put it back in time you get jump scared. Thank you for listening to my response.
5:06 or it was changed because Utah is important to the plot or something like that
4:17 or those who think Fredbear and Golden Freddy are two separate beings.
im buying tickets as soon as i can
13:40 Thats what i expected to hear from lore master himself
YALL IGNORING THE FACT THE KID IS WEARING A STRIPED SHIRT, THEY WOULD'VE MADE HIM WEAR PINK IF HE WAS THE CUPCAKE.
I'm just going to throw out the fact that most real-life kidnappings are conducted by family members of the victim, and that the way Garrett is shown -- unbound and unharmed, holding a toy and staring out the back window of a car -- doesn't really match up with the scenario of a terrified kid being snatched by a psychotic stranger...
I watched this when it was only 16h ago, but sadly now it's already 22h and I comment now. :(
MATT, MATT ITS A KID WITH STRIPED SHIRT ! KID WITH STRIPED SHIRT! NOT CUPCAKE ITS CRYING CHILD
When the first trailer came out I was already awaiting this.
It would be funny if when the movies comes out and Matt pat is wrong😭
i think this is the most waited movie ever like we waited for this almost a decade
13:47 GOLDEN *WHAT?!*  MATTHEW.  *MATTHEW.*  YOU CANNOT SPEAK SUCH FAZBLASPHEMY TO US, BELIEVING THERE TO BE NO FAZCONSEQUENCES FOR SUCH FAZACTION. MAY OUR FAZLORD HAVE FAZMERCY ON YOU IN FAZHEAVEN.
tbh, you can't really solve a movie that hasn't come out yet
Blud solved a movie that hasn't  come out yet
finaly mat pad has an escuse to post about fnaf in this channel
Man i really dont know the identity of that kid i want to know it
imma pass on google meet, id rather use discord anyways, great video
I thought the fifth kid was the puppet bc of the stripes😭
MAT I JUST NOTICED that the kid the blonde one with no caractheristics has GRAY STRIPES on his t shirt (mhhh it seems like someone in this franchise)
thanks to this channel I have been able to have a lot of fun theorizing about this movie with kids at work; I am a bookseller.
Wait. It would make sense if the younger brother was the cupcake. When Chica said “I was the first, I have seen everything” she’s speaking on behalf of the cupcake. Maybe they share a conscience or the cupcake isn’t able to talk or sustain without Chica for very long. And maybe Mike gets fired, but he has this mission to save them, so he changes his name and gets hired on as Jeremy.
The movie it is coming at the same day as my birthday im so happy and hyped
Wait, a sponzor? From Google Meet?!?!? I was forced to use that and, weeell let's just say that Skype was better 😅
me and the bois here from the beginning: ah sh*t, here we go again
6:25 oh no, I have fnaf VHS ptsd
Bros getting sponsors from everywhere
How did you spoil a movie that hasnt come out 😭🙏
Cupcake is Susie’s dog..
cool theory mat
6:50 maybe they just cut some information? Not everyone want MatPat to spoil the movie just by looking at the stickers XD (and it would be good idea to wait with those details after film relases)
Mike: would do anything for money 20 whole dollars appears out of nowhere
Puppet? The 5th mysterious kid could be puppet cuz of the striped long sleeve shirt
Matpat: I think the kid is the cupcake The kid: *wearing stripes like the puppet*
Matpat stop please. Your theories make no sense anymore, when i first watched your videos they were great cause you had actual evidence to cover up your theories now you’re just saying random stuff. Fuhnaff and Ryetoast are better theorist then you.
the intros get better every time
not to mention that his comment about being nicer in real life is followed by an evil devil purple man emoji. 😈
I AGEEE WITH THE CUPCAKE CHILD
Not only can you get Laura from the books and the games you can also get it from the spinoff example Gacha life the Afton family gives a lot of detail about their debts and who they are and gives the mother of the Afton children and name
I look forward to eventually seeing this, it`s been such a long wait.
At 15:06 i believe he is the crying child
Isn't the man that was getting drowned by security into the pool Garrett Hines? And doesn't Abby sound in the trailer like the balloon boy when she says "Hello?"
If the movie is delayed I blame matpat
IT didn't even came out this guy already found out the lore
I don't know the kid has a striped shirt he might be the Marionette
No Henry Emily?
But what is when the boy without characteristic and Mike's brother are Golden Freddy ???
the 5th boy could be cryingchild or the puppet, due to the striped shirt
Has anyone noticed that Garret looks an awful lot like Gregory?
THE 5TH CHILD IS THE MIMIC
Isn’t the cupcake named Carl? I keep correcting him every video 😂
ITS THE MIMIC BRO
Haha no you didn't go back to making sans is ness thoeries
If I’m going to be honest I think because of the games that there will be two spirts in golden Freddy. One that is a family member and one that is vengeful just like the games
did they invent a shrink ray and shrink the kid to fit into the cupcake
The child actors' interactions on social media are so adorable 😆  Can't wait to watch this movie! And can't wait for the Mr. Afton scenes 😈
I still believe that Vanessa either lied about or is just oblivious to the motivations of the animatronics, I mean one of the most important details about the animatronics in the game was the fact that they HATE adults, so I think they actually want to SAVE Abbie, and want to separate her from the adults. This means they are hostile towards Mike, which he may think equals to them being aggressive towards Abbie. Also Abbie might be scared from them solely because they’re big and scary, not because they want to hurt her. This adds up especially is they want to play the “Mike is Afton’s son” card because the two men being similar would give even more motive for the animatronics to be hostile towards him
It’s weird seeing Fnaf on film theory
Blumhouse:"Sir, the movie hasnt released yet."
I’ve said this during walten files. But google only sponsoring “a portion” of a video feels extremely petty
Ha, should have had Google Meet sponsor your Wagyu Beef video.
Matpat must of went insane when the trailer came out saying AHHHH MORE THEORIES AHHHHHH
0:51 I used that costume in 4th grade😶
Listen. I just want Movie Michael. He's my boi
The real theory is whether mat is getting a cameo in this trilogy or not
Fnaf 2 i always come back
The cupcake is Susie's dog and the striped shirt kid is crying child/mike's brother
MATPAT. ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET TAKE A BREAK. PHONE DOWN. NOW.
can u do a theory for lofi girl?
FINALLLLLYYYY HE DID IT
I think that this movie might be a sequel to everything and put it to an end after the pizzeria simulator
I think the extra boy in the dead children scene is going to be the puppet
It’s just a glitch in the matrix
im just glad theres going to be two more movis so maybe next time scott wont be so rude and will give matpat maybe even a medium role w his acting experience, it would be awesome
The movie hasnt even came out and thi mf be lile: i solved the entire movie!
Watch the reason for FNAF the movie is so that film theory can make a video on FNAF
15:43 the cupcake can leave chicas hand in help wanted
Hey. We saw in the fourth closet that the Charlie/circus baby bot had those razor blade things in her face!
For some reason, the 5th child, I cant see as the cupcake. If you notice his stripped dark shirt, it makes you think of the puppet. Notice has more visible he his in that scene, like he play more importance. He looks like the crying child, to me...
@15:05 golden hair isnt enough for golden freddy refrence?
Bro is that good
My original first thought when I saw the cupcake attacking separately was that it was a link or reference to Susie in the games, because, if I remember correctly, she was lured in by Afton because of her missing dog that was assumed to be dead because of depictions in a mini game (I forget which one). And in my mind, the way that the cupcake attacked looked like that of how dogs are usually depicted when attacking someone who is prone in movies. But I did also wonder who the fifth child was when there was no direct link to golden Freddy, so I like this theory!
1 on trending, we really can’t ever get out of this fnaf chokehold 😭
Bro really tried to sneak in Nebraska ☠️☠️☠️
Matpat: It’s been so many years... Me: ITS BEEN SOO LOOOONG-
The "Remnant extractor" oddly looks like a mask for the endo-skeleton 2:35
17:58 he is in ur walls
Matpat, this is the 7th time this year you solved the fnaf franchise
Great theory! I'm looking forward to the movie. How do you think Mary Stuart Masterson's character (Female Villain/Aunt Jane) will play in ?
If there is something special with the wall. My guess would be something behind the wall, aka the hidden back room. Probably found at the end if the movie to connect all loose ends and to be a info dump.
I'm not exactly sure how this would work out, I'd need to think about it more. But that last kid had a striped shirt like the puppet or the crying child
Bro it hasn’t even released💀
Looking at the fifth kid, any characteristic he might have could be his striped top matching him to the Marionette. Unless they show any other animatronic from the other FNaF games, they might not show much more of the boy unless they have a potential second movie and they use the FNaF2 cast and the boy returns for the Marionette.
Fnaf is everywhere now. You cannot escape this Mat!
I'm kind of surprised Mat didn't make the connection between the 5th kids STRIPED shirt and the puppets arms! Don't know if that'll be anything and I'm not veteran enough in the lore to speculate further, but Mat saying that they didn't share ANY characteristic with one of the animatronics felt a little odd when the colouring and pattern is almost identical to the puppets arms.
I love how Matpat went onto an actor's socials and essentially stalked the poor child for, say it with me, *LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE*
Please, Matpat with all due respect, leave Baby alone. Leave the demon to her demons, it's not worth scratching your heads over and trying to connect Abby into a new interpretation of Baby. Let the film be it's own thing. I'm pretty exhausted seeing Baby everywhere in theories.
Everyone enjoying the movie.   markiplier: is that the bite of 87😱
REMNANT???? I'm like 3 minutes in and this is already just GTLive
my guess is golden freddy will be protecting abby from the other animatronics who want to make her like them.  my guess is golden freddy wants to keep her alive and free.
17:13 this made my fly outa my chair
bro so talented he solved the movie before the movie
i think you should upload fnaf movie videos to game theory and here
Weird that a FNAF theory is not in game theory
tbh I'm just surprised no one even questioned that the kid with no identifiable connections had a striped grey shirt lol, ik that's not a connection to an animatronic, but it's still visibly there
The striped shirt screams crying child
Maybe the 5th kid is puppet because his stripped shirt is similar to the strips on the puppets arms
Us in the UK are getting this movie 2 days earlier the UK!
:( I really wanted spring lock failure
Mike Schmidt is Mike afton
steve raglan is a code name for everlasting
matpat is now insane
There's a theory that markiplier is afton in the movie
YES FILM THEORY
0:45 XDDD Ps i knew that the cupcake was hit with a soul but i thought it was abby
I hope the makers of this film know that, independently of how much they try to hide them, if they try to put in some secrets and easter eggs Matpat WILL discover them in the first five minutes of the film
I NEED THE PUPPET IN THIS THING
70% Theory 30% Google meet
I would be so hyped if we get an actual William Afton death scene. The gang's been waiting for years to see it on the big screen
nah jit tripping
Here we go. Classic Matpat Theories trying to solve FNAF Lore.
This about to be the best video game movie adaptation.
I know this is the wrong channel BUT could you sometime therosie on battleblock theater bcz its my fav game on xbox 360 and i think theres some theories that can be uncoverd
the kid that we dont know wich animatronic it belongs to has the same haircut as cassidy in UCN.
fun fact mat pat is actualy in the cannon fnaf lore because remnant
Week 9 OF asking for a theory on The dragon prince mystery of Aaravos pls its my favourite show  Ps love all the hard work you and the team put in :)
THE MOVIE AINT EVEN OUT YET
I think the 5th child looks a lot like the crying child
if only puppet was in the movie it can make it more scarier
My thoery is that fifth kid is the puppet. They are wearing a stiped t-shirt
It’s our turn to shine… No one is safe. If you don’t know fnaf, I feel bad for you. You need to find a therapist  0:50 OH TWELVE ASTRAUS WHAT HAVE WE GOT TO  I always knew that it would be a tragic story. I mean, this is FNAF. As a person who tries to make my own theories that probably don’t make sense, I think that Micheal really is Mike Schmidt. Hear me out, we know that in the sister location Mike was scooped.  And now is the FNAF one game. But this is still a bit confusing.   15:22 I think that is crying child. Look at the shirt.. maybe it’s a make-fun by Scott but still I JUST ASKED MY FRIENDS IF THEY KNOW FNAF MOVIE AND THEY SAID WHAT IS THAT I AM GETTING THEM A THERAPIST
7:12 (coming back to this video tomorrow ignore this comment)
At least if it does infect all channels you can have a fnaf weekend ❤❤
I also think that Abby could represent Cassidy in the movie, she could be seen wearing yellow, dark hair and eyes, and become the other spirit in golden Freddy, why?  Golden Freddy has only one eye blue, she could make up the red eye that matpat uses for his video picture of her
How can you invite your dead mother to a Google Meet meeting?
Sponsoring a portion?
13:21 Did you see the yellow monitor? I think it shows a Bunny, a golden bunny. Similar to all the Freddy and friends on tour cartoon, where glitches showed a puzzle of glitchtrap. Am I wrong? Watch this scene like 1000 times.
MaTPat would be a great lawyer and you can’t prove me otherwise
Mat allways comes back
I think Susie’s dog posses the cupcake
bruh... it isnt even out, yet you still solved the theory 0_0
I immediately thought when he said”names can be mixed around” wait a second another Dave miller situation?
Fnaf /live🔴click/here
But what about the "The baby isn't mine" sitcom animations? I don't think Mike Schmidt is William Afton's child, but he might be related somehow, if Mike's mother has a relationship with William Afton later, after Mike is born.
What if Abby's name is just an easter egg and they actually want to turn her into Golden Freddy, which would then make the fifth child the Cupcake
For what it’s worth… I went to Halloween Horror Nights this year and the host of the Blumhouse exhibit they had said “word is the movie will take you through the first 3 games” and the crowd “ooh”d and “aaaah”d. so did I.
kinda nice they askt you to host a ad for em...even nicer you hosted it
I immediately thought the fifth kid was the puppet cause the stripes?
Careful not to get this too close to the real thing Matt, last time you guess the plot of a fnaf project before it officially released it didn't go over well
Been waiting to long for this
Matpat, it's not even out...
Dude why didnt they change the eyes...
If Matpat's kid theory is right, since the film is PG-13 I want the guaranteed curse word to be in a conversation with Mike. "So you're the cupcake?" "Yeah." "Sounds like you drew the short straw." "No sh!t sherlock." 😂
Ha I already use google meet
Just give the animatronics rubber teeth, and weaken the jaw motors so the jaws can't crush anything. There, problem solved. No more bite of 87.
Him explaining fnaf now sounds like a crazy person trying to explain that the government is secretly a race of lizards
google meat
They're not twins one's clearly older
I love those memes at the end of each video 😂😂
Are you going to go to Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Hollywood to see the animatronics in person?
17:43 that looks more like spring bonnie tbh
HOW CAN YOU HAVE ALREADY SOLVED IT IT HASENT EVEN COME OUT YET
Mike Shmit in the movie kinda looks like LeGrand. (someone who collabed with CG5)
Google sells meat now?
If your right then that means we get the springlock scene
shut up
Couldn't the 5th kid be the puppet? The striped shirt being the comparison?
i got my mom into fnaf and she’s never been more confused
what if Mike dies and becomes golden freddy which explains why in non of the shots golden freddy isn"t with Mike
Not to call you out MatPat but i thought the striped- shirt child was the Crying Child..... Like this was literally what i believed when you said the Puppet was there from the beginning
Don't say it started almost a decade ago....Ó⁠╭⁠╮⁠Ò
I’m in love with Josh hutcherson
Matpat please saver the movie I have waited 8 years for this movie at least make 4 videos about the movie
WHO LET BRO COOK?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Wait hold on hold on hold on hold onnnnn you saying that you actually solved something?Lets hope matpat is right
I think the kid in the gray shirt is the puppet cause it looks like the shirt is stripped
Wait, so no springlock failure????
I actually think the cupcake might be Susie’s dog. I know that messes with the lore, but look at the way it attacks that guy it looks like a dog lol
Har har har har har
The Google meet lore is insane😂
What if Mike IS the brother child, but is an animatronic with the soul of the him? A full loop. He thinks he had a brother, but he’s remembering his own memories, prior to being made into a human animatronic
When i go to the movies, i will bring a notebook because of the LOOOOORRRRREEEEEEE
I cant wait to see Shaggy turn from a guy who loves food, to a guy who has mastered Ultra Instinct, to NOW a twisted Serial Killer.
Golden Freddy has only ONE blue eye... every Good Theorist should already know who is Controlling Golden Freddy... IT'S WHEATLEY From Portal 2
I was already on board with Steve Raglan being the villain, but Matt finding a stray comment left by an actor that heavily supports this theory is absolutely bonkers!
I own a Google Pixel. And I did not know, what Google Meet is, till now. Because I never opened it
This is a good theory because it will finally make sense why in FNAF 1 Golden Freddy keeps saying to Mike "IT'S ME" repeatedly. Finally, the first question of the franchise will be answered!! Love your videos Mat, keep going!
Can you do a video on the legal debt of the other teams in the show: Supa strikers
anyone else feel like the title is a jab towards FuhNaff? I know it's very generically worded, but he's become such a large part of the community that there's no way the uploader wouldn't notice...
The puppet would be more likely to be the kid who’s blonde
It's been so long (Since I last have seen my son lost to this monster. To the man behind the slaughter.)
Dear MatPat  I agree on most of that apart from The fifth child  The stripes on his shirt are orange like gold if I May say. If it was the soul in the cupcake then explain this. You say that we have proof that they are in the animatronics. You can’t fit a child in a cupcake the same size as a soccer ball if not smaller. I would love to see your response to this and I’ll be here to see if you can debunk my theory
oh matpat have you learned nothing fanaf has learned your tricks for finding lore and is making it much harder for you
negawatt
Jesus Matpat the movie's not even out yet
Freddy  Chica  Bonnie Foxy  Assemble     Wait , springtrap?
I think im the only person who watched through all the sponsor paying attention
That fifth kid has a striped shirt. He is the puppet
MatPat, Cupcake is possessed by Susie's dog. Didn't they kinda clear that up in the FNaF 6 minigame: "Fruity Maze"???
Fazgoo , Remnant , Sea bonnies , mr hippo its all connected
Can't believe it isnt mentioned, but with the theory that abby becomes baby, baby first appears in fnaf SISTER location
So  this movie confirm that the bite of 83 happen before baby dead?  I know that you in your timeline placed bite of83 before Elizabeth death but every one says that it doesn't make sense becose why stiil don't know why crying child was scared. So i think that this is showing uss who first die
What if the animatronics are trying to save Abby from the "adults" like it was in Silver Eyes with Jason, where Foxy was misinterpreted from the others and Foxy was trying to save him from the rest of the people as he saw them as adults? But hey, that's my theory...
you've heard of google meet, but how about google meat?
wait... abbey is his sister? 12:54
Bro how. The movie even didnt came up
LET THE FREAKING MOVIE COME OUT FIRST THEN DROP A LORE VIDEO MAN!
Matpat when are you opening a college on fnaf lore
The striped shirt on the one kid is like the crying child
I'm surprised that Matpat forget that Chica's Cupcake can move on it's own. In FNAF VR: Help Wanted, we literally have to "Return the Cupcake to Chica's Plate" as it's freely running around us.  Also, there is the possibility that the dog of Susie (the spirit possessing Chica) may be possessing the cupcake since Afton would probably also have to hide the body of the dog after he accidentally hit with his car in FNAF 6: Pizzeria Simulator. Also if the cupcake here attacks people in the movie trailers, it's not to far off to believe that Carl the Cupcake acts "animalistic" and like a dog being sent out by their owner.
Oh boy its that time
To me the gang movie will not be Cannon to the games with a Different Story witch sounds pretty cool.
hi from germany im kinda confused we have a cinema here where i live but i was kinda confused because it said you can already watch the movie it kinda confuses me could anybody help me
this guy could be a real life detective real
It's meant to be an advanced scooper
feels like a spoiler, good vid
it hasn’t even come out yet
The child that you say is the cupcake was obviously wearing STRIPES! Hello what animatronic wears STRIPES?
I am so happy for this theory and I love it
Why is the kid with the Zylinder hat normal freddy and not golden Freddy, his colors are Yellow after all and the Mistery child has a brown shirt so he is Normal freddy
This video will cause a delay in publishing the movie cuz they want to change the twist😂
Matpat; god of fnaf, lord of lore
Can’t wait for Cassidy to be in the cupcake. That’s why the spirit is so vengeful
Didn't Chica's original kid have a dog? I thought the cupcake could be a wild experiment and that's why it did the whole "Get ya effing dog" "it dont bite" bit.
honestly they should have hired matpat as the local conspiracy theorist who no one believed
I don't know how people could be confused with the missing children in the forest, the one in the tophat isn't Freddy, while he has the hat, he also has a yellowish gold shirt. The brown shirt kid is Freddy and the top hat kid is golden freddy
So Michael and Baby won't be Aftons on this movie, that's the prediction?
The 5th child could be Cassidy, and likes brother could be one of two souls in golden Freddy
according to our tour guide at Universal for the Blumhouse Behind the Scenes attraction the movie is combing fnaf 1,2, and 3
This is probably why they didn’t let Mat be in the movie
Steve raglan isn’t William afton because Steve raglan sounds more American and William afton is british therefore proving the theory about steve raglan wrong.
I’m not prepared for this theory, I need my security pizza rolls
bro is out here looking for a kids instagram
Yahoo
Question 🙋‍♀️ can you write a book or start a podcast about how you balance your family life and career?
honestly, if MatPat doesnt get at least a Cameo in the movie, that will be one of the biggest missed opportunities ever.
*To be fair,* FNAF 4 does have Chica's Cupcake _attack_ for *her* rather than herself for a few times. But I guess the Cupcake in the movie could be like Bon Bon (Attatched to Funtime Freddy) from Sister Location (Who also *attacks* the player _and_ can *move* around).
it didint even came out
Im pretty sure the spirit in the brown shirt is freddy and the one with tha hat and in the yellow shirt is golden freddy
Good job mar Pat!
the theory of fnaf animatronics fighting against william afton sounds like gacha story
" It's been so many years. " My brain: " It's been a year daddy "
Hey MatPat, I was thinking that you could do a theory about Ninjago or about the character Cole in Lego Ninjago because there is quite the lore in that series. 😊
matpat, no. just watch the movie before you make theorys fgs.
Is it me, or did he say "urple"?
The whole "breaking into Freddy's and doing crime" scene just reminded me of Cabinet Man by Lemon Demon
What’s fnaf
Zoinks!  Old man Shaggy is the man hiding behind the mask.
Mike, Vannessa, and the animatronics defeat afton by- WATCHING HIM DIE.  ….  oh wait thats not what happens? … oh.
Imagine taking an instagram post from two children saying they’re best bros and interpreting that as lore lol
The fact this got 1# trending is insane
young cory inna matpat video 🥲 we love to see it
Watching this video made me think about that movie 2 before the first released
Why would he kidnapped his own son
The "remnant extractor" might be something you wouldn't expect: The chewing mechanism. Maybe some time ago Henry and William tried to make the robots able to eat, but deemed to dangerous?
BREAKING: Fnaf Movie filming and plotting to start from SCRATCH after MatPat and crew solve the entire plot of the movie, imagine😆
FNAF wines
You need an Fashion Theory about wether spring lock suits are possible make or at lest some form of.
yeah, not buying the cupcake... alternate theory... they are holding back an animatronic... that striped shirt immediately brought another thought to mind to me... the puppet
I think Mike’s dad is his adopted dad and we find out he’s Afton at the end of the movie.
1:32
will there be a bite of 87
Google really sponsored this guy 💀
I like oreos
Will the bite of 83 be in the movie
The removed it now, I just checked, but if you looked on cast for the Fnaf movie on google, Lillard’s character was noted as “William Afton”
I've always loved FNAF I'm so excited for the movie! Can't wait to see the video that comes out after Matt watches it.
I find it interesting that the animatronics try to befriend Abby rather than just killing her. Mabey they're seducing her with say...  Ice Cream?
I must see the springtrap scene WITH GRAPHIC
Day 29 of asking matpat to make a theory on emesis blue
What if the games IRL, are the games that were made like what FNAF Help Wanted is?
cupcake kid has the same haircut as a cupcake top lol
Don't you dare spoil this movie 😨😑
Pretty sure Lillard still is Afton and his temp agency persona is just that, a persona.
In terms of when the movie is set, it has to be after 1998, since Mikes car is a 1998 Honda Accord. And it does not look like it is in that new of condition, so probably 5 to idk how many years after 1998.
2:08 Okay, not to burst your bubble here but this is FNaF we're talking about... Pretty sure everyone knows happy endings don't exist.
I think Matt forgot that there’s two spirits that inhabit golden Freddy
No this gooooooooooooooood
I think Mike will die at one point in the movie and become Golden Freddy. That is why we see it with Abby.
Matpat:keep your eyes on your monitor  Me: puts my eyes really close to my monitor  Matpat:*flashbangs me*
11:12 to skip ad
I see i understand matt patt now he's on to something
What I would like to know is if Micheal and William are still related in this movie universe and if that is the case how does he not recognize his actual father? And why would he only kidnap garret and not Micheal aswell? Guess there was a divorce or something. I also wonder if the Bite of 83 ever happened? That kidnap flashback with mike and garret could also be fake and mike is still responsible for garrets death and cant accept that fully or something like that.
Bros makin theory’s about a movie before it even comes out 💀💀💀💀💀
Missed opportunity, we needed a Gt live Ashe "REMNANT!" Declaration.
Hello, everybody, welcome to another episode.
It's not out right
I can't tell if we should be celebrating the release of this theory or mourning the loss of another piece of Mat's sanity
Plot twist, garret Is spring trap
15:24 the kid in the trailer has a striped shirt just like a certain Evan from the fnaf 4 minigames. So my best bet is that afton after the death of Evan left his family and Michael lived with the guilt. - team theorist romania
Cramming evening into a single movie. Like that hasn't gone badly before.
Blud solved a film that didn't even come out💀💀
That one kid who you don’t know who he is,well golden Freddy’s spirit has blond wavy hair right or look at the striped shirt…it might be C.C.
imaging like. making a movie and then like. not putting mat in the movie like. cause its not like. mat is like. a good fnaf content creater like. im really sad like. and sorry fore mat.
I bet this channel has lore it’s self!
I’m glad we can agree that Matpat would be put into Chica
Kid with striped sweatshirt... OH YEAH THE CUPCAKE!
it hasn’t even came out 😭
5th kid is wearing striped shirt...puppet?
I think the theorist channels have become the McDonald's of youtube
my dad looks a lot like william afton. i wonder what he did in the 80s
The 5th child that you thought was the cupcake might be the crying child due to the same stripy shirt and hair design
Last kid .. his shirt is like the crying child, but isn't that in the wrong timeline, but it lk make sense ig
Dude just spoiled an entire movie before it have even come out
the fnaf movie comes out on my birthday and it makes me so happy! lol I loved this video!
HOLY THE INTRO ACTUALLY SCARED THE CREP OUT OF ME?!?!
Maybe they'll make a second movie?
10 years later will be a re-cap of this video and saying that he was all wrong 😂❤
Day 4 of asking you at make a game theory video of the roblox game Jim’s Computer
i’m sorry, but the guy who is supposedly playing willy a. has those stereotypical serial killer glasses. just thought about it… google andrey chikatilo for example
Mike should sing a version of Santa Fe from newsies called Nebraska
in the scene where vanessa gets grabbed by springtrap if you slow it down her face before she gets grabbed suggests that she is trying to talk some sense into him.
Matpat, you should look at this new ARG from Time To Smile. It is really interesting so far.
what a surprise, another fnaf video. can we get ANY video thats not about a horror game PLEASE??? they are all the same
"Mom can we go watch fnaf" "No sweety we have fnaf at home" The fanf at home:
I thought the extra kid was gonna be the puppet because of the striped shirt
If your Pokemon theory is anything to go by, you should just suggest that Bonnie is possessed by Mike's mom.
How do you find FNAF content, this channel is one of the only ones with it
2:02 YOOOOOOOOOO THAT'S THE SHOGUN HIMSELF 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 THAT'S CORYXKENSHIN YALL
2:06 no we saw Michael being stuffed in the animatonic suit in the trailer (didn’t saw the rest oft the video so let’s see :O)
When I saw stripes on the shirt, I thought that fifth child could be the security puppet. I can't really see colors well, but when I saw the stripes, that's where my head went to.
With the new stuff from the trailer it really makes you wonder if the 5th child was carl the cupcake the entire time. I mean granted he never attacks you in the first few games at all, he just disappears from chica and toy chica's hands the moment they're on the hunt and nightmare cupcake likely isn't real. But with carl being active in the trailers it's made me realize, he's been active for awhile now. In help wanted, carl starts running around in chica's parts and service and in ruin the giant carl watches you and knocks you off the conveyor belt in the chica's bakery section. To be fair he probably isn't possessed in the original set of games but there is a possibility in future games.
I kind of feel like its weird that the mystery kid has a striped shirt
Might as well title this video as spoilers 😂😂  Nah jk it’s just a theory lol
its comming out on my birthday!
"Matpat, this is the 69th time you solved FNaF Lore"
Wouldn't William Afton have to hide the boys body inside cupcake for it to be possessed?
Tldr a child actor accidentally spoils the plot on Instagram
THAT KIDS THE PUPPET RIGHT!?
How did William Afton get a soul into cupcake tho
Wouldn't surprise me if they left this video close to the release so they wouldn't change the anything like they did with the games
Lets  go ill watch it 2 days after my bday
3:01 how tf did u know I’m Mexican
Phone guy: why did I catch you watching game theory while on the job? you know the beef we have with This dude? he keeps trying to break into the pizzaria, trying to take all the pizza ovens my guy, looking for clues looking for Easter eggs. we had to replace one of the pizza ovens cus he literally took it, I don't know how- how does he lift?! your task is to make sure he doesn't get in here! what am I paying you 3$ an hour for?
Man casually sponsored by GOOGLE
ASHHDGGSGGSG LILLARD IS A BIG PART OF THE MOVIES???
I have a theory what if Scott didn't originaly have a plan so he took the theories people made and hinted them
Matpat, unfortunately you have already made one mistake,  thinking you've solved it. When will we learn...
MatPat debating to put this on film theory or game theory:           AHHHHHHHH 🫨
I didn't even notice that was Josh Hutcherson.
I think that this film is an in-universe film, like how it’s been suggested the original games were in-universe games based on a real Fazbear’s Pizzeria that the VR game proposed.
dude imagine being sponsored by google , thats crazy
15:30 I actually had the same thought the cupcake moved so it has a child in it
15:54 respectfully, chica has been able to do this since FNAF 4, nightmare chica could throw her cupcake, and jack-o chica could throw her pumpkin. Either this spirit is the Spirit of Cassidy (because there are five missing kids, and five spirits. If that wasn't Cassidy then it's dumb to not have six spirits in this scene). Looking at it now I thought it might've been the spirit of the puppet because his shirt has stripes... then I remembered Charlotte was a girl... More than likely the soul is part of the cupcake and the animatronic at the same time
Matpats power to be sponsored by google gives me faith in his future Diet Coke sponsorship, I mean come on Diet Coke
This is might be one of the only times my name is in a movie but it’s a kidnapped kid
Im so glad this isn't Canon to the games
The drawing of all of afton in his suit and the kids kinda reminds me of 4th closet where Clayton’s was put into that big abomination of the og 4, and the drawing of those kids and afton
I am disappointed there was no megalovania drop when pointing out golden Freddy's iconic blue eye 😭
And at the end of the movie, the cops show up, 1 guy asks: "What you think happened here ?" Then a mysterious guy with a cap looks at the audience and says: "... I've got theory..." ROLL THE CREDITS
End of movie: ???: hey girl want some ice cream? Abby: yeah sur-
Matpat hear me out, the people trashing the Freddy faz bears pizzeria aren’t doing it for fun but I think they have a good reason for it. I think hank is Henry from the games and I think he put up a plan to destroy the place because he knows about Williams atrocities.
talk about rainworld
Wait but if that kid is cupcake then how did his body get put in it?
I'm gonna be the first to say. Matt, that's a lot of fnaf, are you ok?
The octover 27 is my birthday and as a fan of fnaf I love the day it releases!
0:10 you could say….         It’s been so long…
Mike Afton that’s your brain walking
I'm mad exited
You didn’t solve it… but that’s ok  Watch this comment 🤐🤫
i never had a fnaf phase but even i kinda wanna go see this lol
Maybe this is why they didn’t hire mat pat. So he could do a theory on the movie!
I do think Garrett becomes golden Freddy, but the other kid is also golden Freddy. I may not be right but in the serene with all the kids in the forest. The kid with nothing and the kid he said is the cupcake. Has a gray stripe shirt. I think that Garrett doesn't get put into the body right away. Also in the trailer golden Freddy only has one eye. With the other eye being broken. I think later in the movie we will see the second eye glow some other color. He might also be a little weirder then normal.
So by the trailer at the end he gets turned into a animatronic right
I saw that begining in full screen 💀
Hello mat,  I have loved your channels for many years. I have watched since 2014, and seen many theories rise and fall. And i appreciate your videos. I also watch the owl house. And since the final episode, i have had many questions, like the archivists. I would really appreciate a theory on the owl house, it is a great show. I appreciate you make a lot of videos. Thank you.
Get ready guys, Matpat’s about to write the fnaf movie.
Who uses Google MeAt
Fnaf 👍
I thought that William could’ve become golden Freddy and the torture machine was a scooper like machine
wow
Casually solves the movie in one attempt when game theory is crying under their bed after spending just about a decade
I'd have to disagree with Matpat on the "remnant extractor" device. if it were that it'd look more like Afton's design of the Scooper. I believe it's simply showing what happens to the guards after they get caught by the animatronics. that they get stuffed into a Freddy Fazbear suit that is all choppy, spinny and slicey-dicey on the insides for humans to wear.
If this is correct then this is the biggest spoiler of all movies I have ever seen 😂
“Film Theory: I Solved The FNAF Movie” My guy it isn’t even out yet 💀
Matpat should have a cameo in the movie because I feel like he’s a lot of the reason fnaf is as popular as it is
Matpat really treating the trailer as a warm-up.  Man has always been insane ever since fnaf came out.
Forgot to mention the Lillard homage to Ghostface
14:30 To me, that looks like a animatronic mask with blades in it. I think the story could take a bit of a bittersweet ending with it, and there's a half chance that Golden Freddy could end up being Mike himself.
11:12  is when the ad breck ends
I’m gonna throw my theorist hat in the ring and say that MatPat is wrong about Baby. I think that Abby will get stuffed into Golden Freddy alongside her lost brother and will be the stand in for the vengeful spirit in the film universe
Bro was sponsored by his employer
i just saw the number of likes go from 99 k to 100k as i klicked on the video¨
The kid with the Brown short IS Freddy and there IS a kid with yellow and with hat Who it may be golden Freddy
H-..HOW?! THE MOVIE AINT EVEN OUT UNTIL A MONTH?!?!
The FNAF movie releases on my birthday.
The last kid is the crying child
15:30 DONT THE STRIPES JUST SCREAM THE PUPPET???
*GRAY STRIPED CRYING CHILD'S CLOTHES!!!!!*
the budget markiplier intro
I think that cupcake is Susie’s dog
guess the looooreeee
will rise
Red arrow
man he did even without the movie out crazy
Personally I think the golden freddy twist is either what you said, with mike’s brother. Or mike is golden freddy, the torture scene makes me think that either he escapes it or gets turned into golden freddy which is why we see goldy leaving the pizzeria with Abby, trying to figure out how to turn back. Throughout the second half of the all trailers, none of them have mike. But hey thats just a theory, just a chicken theory
The craziest part of this theory is that children have Instagram accounts
Biggest unsolved mystery: how the heck has it been almost TEN YEARS since the first game released 🥴
Imagine if bro has just spoiled the whole film istg 😂
It never ends Matpat. IT NEVER ENDS
@The Film Theory  The 5th kid u said is possessed by the cupcake looks like Gregory from security breach.
Cupcake is possessed by Susie’s dog and Matpat already theorized that Golden Freddy has two souls. The kid has a striped shirt, just like the Crying Child. This would confirm Matpat’s theory about Golden Freddy. Either that, or it is a surprise animatronic like Balloon Boy as he is confirmed to have a soul inside of him due to Phantom Balloon Boy.
I feel like this is too accurate and has spoilers but like....movies not even out yet.
Ah yes ..... 5 minutes at Freddy's...... I love automatic captions
Are u in tye film..
Cory my dude CoryxKenshin you made it
Raise your hand if you're lost. 🙋‍♂️
3:05 lol
It’s only a matter of time before Matpat creates a Game Theory ARG.
It doesnt even come out for another month!!
soooooo... does that mean cerc. oktober 30 will be a fnaf crossover day?
I hope at the end he gets springlocked at the end it will be sooooo gooodddd
Gentlemen i am very happy to announce that it's my birthday today
Just saying…a fnaf movie theory? Best birthday present ever!
Huh my comment got deleted straight away...
when the cursed matpat hits 💀
Fnaf on all channels will complete the prophecy
how
15:21 THE. PUPPET.
I think that the cupcake kid us not the cupcake but rather the PUPPET .DAN DAN DAAAAAAAN.(Lightning)
Har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har harharharharharh har har har har harharhar haaaarrr
Golden Freddy is a girl and I hope that Evan is in the movie cuz he is my favorite human in Fnaf. But that means that Abby is Elisabeth if she is is mikes brother
Bro just spoiled the whole movie
i have a feeling that the 5th kid spirit is the crying child, but my mind is telling me that they dont have that much characteristics that could link up to that point  Edit: i got that feeling because they have the same shirt
You are really the best theorist out there, everything you said is probably right I'm hyped for the movie we'll see if your theory is in fact correct or not.
The machine may be the scooper, or perhaps a dream sequence.
LoL why he sound like skip Bayless when he said its my turn😂😂
Can’t wait for fnaf food theory
I agree with most of this theory, however, I think that the animatronics are going to succeed with their plan of making Abby, ' one of them ', in a completely different way. There's one more animatronic that is confirmed to appear in the movie but was kept in the dark. The animatronic's name? The Puppet!
The happines on my face when FNAF comesumes another of his chanels
yeah sure you have been using google meets not discord
Striped shirt, striped candle he is the cup cake
The apple being the villain would be hilarious, but a rip off of Krang.
The blue eyes mean that it is at peace, because the red eyes mean read because we know that from the second game, because maybe Cassidy forgave him, and is now the friending Abi
Seriously? Man, this comment is ironically written but still, when you say the thing with every YouTuber has played fanf, then you didn't show Mark ._., shame on you
So.... Misdirection and misfortune?
lets watch if matpat hits the target this time...
*William casually stuffs kids in animatronic cupcakes*
That one school app finally does sponsor this channel
I commented
😳that’s the day after my birthday 0:36
I am so tired of these 5 nights videos. I swear more than half the videos Film Theory releases are FNAF videos and I'm so tired of it.
Poor MatPat, now he has to track the FNAF Cinematic Universe on top of all the regular FNAF Lore 😂
lucas grant is throwing with that comment
The best combo matpat and fnaf
But why hast the one Kid a Striped shirt
Google meet is ass,I don't care who tells me otherwise
mat may have a time machie bc he sounds spot on
Matpat when he realized he could make fnaf content on film theory now🤑🤑
So was he quoting something in the intro there, or just being dramatic?
Matpat makes a theory about everything at this point 😅
I think my partner and I need to see this movie for our anniversary… I love Matthew Lillard and FNAF is like comfort food horror to me.
Maybe the spirit of chicka is the younger sis of the cupcake spirit.   The girl was always helped by her brother and now she is helping him
60 episodes yeah but probably closer to 100 hours to watch them all lol
Commenting for the algorithm but I’m not risking this one lads, if the pathew   Matrick is going to get any prediction right it’s going to be FNAF
Now they Will need to make fnaf movie V2
fnaf lore is really -funny but- sad to complete
I think the cupcake is probably sussie's dog
0:48  “oh my sweet stars, what have I done?” Mat Pat- September 19th, 2023
What if Abby is the puppet.Abby looks like Cassie idk it's gust a theorists .
They should have done the scott cawthon thing for the movie.wait for mat pat to make a theory about it and release it after/before he posts his theory 😂.  Fun to see that fnaf did infect film theory, next food theory. Nothing willl be able to stop fnaf from infecting all the theory channels
I think this is his revenge because he wasn't part of the movie
15:11 striped shirt blue jeans could be crying child the color scheme is to close for him not to be
One more month
Fnaf cookbook: now take the dead child and allow it to defrost inside the animatronic mascot untill it turns into a pale ghost
Fnaf movie's stuffing:WITH A FACE KILLING MACHINE fnaf games' stuffing:JUST ADD THE PEAROSN AND MASK THEN DIES
Me waiting to see the fnaf movie just to think that when we finally go to the theaters Scott’s final prank a video of him explaining there is no movie
Mmmmmh google meat😋
Pls do a video about madness combat (day 2 of asking)
Google meat ???
That kid is about to get a pr lesson
Movie drops on my birthday
Not the movie coming 10 days after my birthday so I made my friends come to watch it with me💀
This isn't FNAF related, but I remember that two nights ago While I was sleeping, I had dreamt of what he says at 11:16 and the drawing at 11:21...
The mystery kid has a stripped shirt if im correct?
can he link the slideshow
For style theory, you can try to see how realistic a spring lock suit is
Then, the movie comes out and Matpat's theory is all wrong
HOW how do you solve a movie that hasn't been out yet
what i think is that the cupcake isnt the kid, but is actually EDP.
MatPat allways comes back with FNAF theory
I'm really hoping Mike's Dad is just some extra from a flashback that looks at random kid #5 and says "Come on Mike, time to to go home."
watch him be wrong again
What if the last kid is the puppet? He's dressed in a striped shirt so that could be the symbolism
No
15:14 he has a striped shirt like the crying child I feel he’s Evan though he does have blonde hair So maybe not
Nice
The 5th kid is not cupcake it is the puppert because they all have things to know who they are. The kid is in stripes like the puppets arms.
It's worse because I inserted myself as the next security guard wanting to avenge Michael (a.k.a glamrock freddy) and ending afton once and for all
Unbelievable to me that a Game Theory Ad is how I learned about Google Meet
I haven't seen the rest of the video but coming from the "You usually don't see a poster advertising the state your in"  I live in Alaska and it's the exact opposite here with Alaska tourism and 'Alaskan pride' advertising everywhere.
Stripes on the kids shirt the puppet has not been involved
Is the next sponsoration gonna be youtube?
at the start the only thing scary is your teeth being yelllowish
I was gonna guess the puppet because of the striped shirt.
Man I remember when Fnaf first came out who could’ve predicted that it got so huge
Tho WHERE’S CASSIDY?????? MY FAVORITE MISSING CHILD😭😭😭
cant believe that 9 years ago i was 10 years old and first introduced to fnaf via the king of fnaf himself and the king of theories himself to think that fnaf will literally be half my age next year makes me feel old and ill only be turning 20 T-T but im glad ive had one of the best franchises to grow up with even though it may be confusing at times ive always went to matpats videos on game theory to help me understand the lore and the fact that i personally havent been able to purchase the books but mat alwasy goes to explain things on that end for those who havent been able to catch up in that way is something he doesnt have to do but i appreciate it, im not even sure if ill be able to see the movie straight away but i appreciate the fact that mat's going to cover it for us <3
…the movie hasn’t even released yet
my prediction regarding Abby: She gets badly injured in/around the final fight, and to save his newfound friend/sister, Golden Freddy puts her in Baby. Her body dies, but the soul lives on.
Matt I love you buddy but...go touch some grass
1:25 that made me so happy to see Corys old fnaf vids
Waiting for matpat to release that cupcake kills a guy named Karl a hit to the Karl the cupcake nicknamed
This is a decent theory, but all the Abby = Baby stuff is a stretch, and I mean a very wide one
The cupcake is nes
What if the other child is the puppet, the child has stripes similar to the puppets design. What if he no longer has a body to control like the others but still haunts the pizzaria?
10:13 I definitely have no idea why the editor implied to something I have no idea about
*jabs spear* Get this FNAF monsetr off Film Theory. Stay back on FNAF Theory where you belong!
Did u say "sister Abby" I was assume it was his daughter
Golden Freddy is mike
Your theory has a lot of holes in it, and there's no explanation for why the ghosts would want to hurt another kid. You said this is a time kompression of the timeline? Well, let's talk Security Breach.  You missed Vanessa's strange reaction before William grabs her neck. She wasn't expecting him to attack her. She's a mole, at least to start with. That gives her motive to lie. She tells Mike about the ghosts. Well, this is true, but what if she thought she was lying?   The animatronics are shown with yellow eyes most of the time, not red, and the red eye moments look very different. Abby hides from Foxxy while his eyes are clearly red. Something is different. Is a ghost reallly chasing her? Or do the red eyes signify a seek and capture AI programmed by William? THAT would explain why the animatronics (and not the ghosts) would be after Abby. Golden Freddy's blue eyes could signify he isn't tainted by William's AI.
MatPat giving us spoilers, before the film even releases😭
Why is it so funny that matpat is already theorising a movie that hasn’t even came out 💀
I don't think that kid is the cupcake I mean the striped shirt I think it's the crying child
Markiplier has a rpg
i see you adding cory haha
"So today, Film Theory does what Game Thery's never been able to do: SOLVE THIS FRANCHISE".  Also MatPat for the last 8 years: IT'S SOLVED GUYS, REALLY. I SWEAR THIS ONE IS THE DEFINITIVE ONE, NO WAY SOMETHING NEW COMES ALONG AND CHANGES THINGS.  I swear the day FNAF stops making content MatPat's gonna have a crysis. We will need to keep a SW on him.
Also I hate horror films but I love fnaf so I’m both excited AND dreading watching the fnaf movie
My boss just purchased 30 acres of land and plans on building a giant laser tag bowling alley arcade place .. I'm trying very hard to get him to base it off the pizza Plex
Even though I believe Europe gets the film on October 26th (so that’s 1 win for Britain)
scotts out to hunt you Matpat im tellin ya XD 0:34
Question - where is the puppet? Perhaps the kid without a direct connection to the core 4 and golden Freddy is the stand in for Charlie with his striped shirt?
I've been noticing a lack of intro theme recently
You got sponsored by google what the?
I think cupcake should be playd by edp (for obvious reasons)
Hey guys what do you think fnaf stands for?  Uh five nights at uuuuuuuuuuuh  Ffffive nightssss attt ffffederal prisons .. my dad played that
Bro is so famous he got google sponsoring him
0:37 Fish
0:37 Fish
you know on the babrbie vidoe
scott:*tease a movie matpat:*solve it before it comes out
I’ll bet a 100 dollars that he will make a theory of fnaf again
did you read my coment about this
wouldnt it be funny if Scott really had no lore for the games and put random easter eggs just to let Mat make the lore himself
This might be dumb but I think the other kid is actually the crying child. Look at his shirt. And he was killed also and maybe mike was one of the older brothers or something idk it's dumb I just thought about it
It's not even out yet how TF
I wonder if they will make the boy in the stripped shirt “the puppet”? Also I think Mike will get got in the end, giving himself to the animatronics and taking the place of his sister that they want and HE will end up in the Golden Freddy suit and stay with her to protect her forever
Please Matpat do a theory on the looooooore of bfdi
I'm actually pretty disappointed so far. I really would have liked to see Mike and Abby find out about the missing kids once they start getting attacked by the animatronics. before anyone else could. But, NO, BLONDIE shows up and RUINS the ENTIRE THING!
1:15 A great deal of intentional effort.
My aunt lives in Nebraska 😮
the last kid is wearing a striped T-shit... Could always be a hint to the puppet
lets go
yes 16 hrs ago
I have a Theory what if the kid that could be cupcake could actually be the crying child
Good  to see Playpals made it
I think the movie is going to be the events how they really happened that the rouge indie game dev references
True
That kid looks like the kid from the famous bite aka the first victim
Your voice sounded like ai
Iphone has face time lol who cares about google trash??
Matpat forgot one key detail in the cupcake kids outfit,, he's dresses like the crying child
Matpat why mimic teeth are same as day ang nighi and eclipse”s teeth ????????😢😢😢😢😢😢😅😅😅😅😅😅😅🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
15:23 he kind of resembles the crying child
The remnant extractor is actually nightmare Freddys mouth
What if the kid with the stripes is supposed to be the puppet? Didn't the puppet have stripes all over his body like that kid's shirt?
"I solved the FNaF movie!" Silly MatPat, you're not FuhNaff.
It's been years sense Matpat made hit first video of fnaf, God I feel old 💀
Good luck with that timeline, yikes.
Did you just ruin the FNAF movie before I could see it  God dang it matt patt   Also the 18th story hide and seek from   faz bear frights is about midnight motorist   Read the 6th book  And the 3rd graphic novel
IT HASENT EVEN CAME OUT YET😢
I think that maybe this is another branch of Fazbear in Nebraska, the 1990’s and that’s why it’s different. Althoygh, rhe 2 same names thing? Iv’e seen 2 people with the same first and last name, but still…
Did you noticed that the FNAF movie poster is similar to FNAF 2 title screen?
The kid is the crying child! Not the cupcake!! He's wearing a striped shirt!!
Maybe the two kids are together in golden freddy and that's why golden freddy is befriended with abby
And you forgot about a thing
4:02 I don’t know if this is MatPat making a Man On The Internet reference, but it certainly seems like one. (MOTI made a springtrap song called ‘Unbroken’)
I love this game, I’ve been playing the OG Game to get hyped up
Mikes dad is definitely Henry
That Freddy costume is very uncomfortable
The remnant extractor looks like it has two red dot that to me are eyes. I think the remnant extractor is an animatronic
Even Google sponsores GT
Day 2: of asking to make a video about how L sits (I am genuinely curious in this)
avenge i show meat matpat
what if Cassie's dad is glam-rock Bonnie it does make sense Bonnie was her dad's favorite character and he's presumed to be dead so maybe and help wanted 2 glamrock Bonnie comes to help
The kid who could be the cupcake, has a striped Shirt which remind me strongly of the Puppet. Even if it would mess with Story and timeline. Just wanted to put that out
37 DAYS LEFT!!!!!!!!      37 DAAAAAYS!
The "It's coming for Food Theory next" was the best, now i imagin a Freddy Pizza or a Freddy Burger  😂😂
Garret could be not golden freddy instead a Animatronic which wasnt shown like marrionet
DONT SPOIL IIIIIITTTT
Fnaf:our lore is a bit difficult but won't drive someone to insanity   Matpat:
The kid to me seems like it would be the puppet. Kid wears striped shirt - So does the puppet. Kid is also out the closest to Mike which is moreso what a leader would do - which unless I am mistaken what the Puppet was..
bro imagine you die with your friends but instead of turning in to animotronics like them but you turned in to a cupcake
I thought that the kid in the brown shirt would be Freddy, and the kid with the top hat and yellow shirt would be Golden Freddy. Also, I really like the theory.
Matpat is already predicting the new movie that is not in the work jet
I love how you keep saying "Filmmakers" like Scott didn't write the script. Which he did. This is Scott's movie, he wrote it.
Maybe Nebraska is where the missing brother incident began and he doesn't and can't forget.  Also GigaMontyGolfer's theory in the comments of chica and the cupcake actually being Susie and her dog is a good one  The mystery kid has a striped shirt Maybe it's nothing but I'd like to think it's something something  In fairness I just want to see the marionette in live action
i think mike's brother is fredbear
0:44 Yeah A FNAF Cookbook that was Suppossed to release in September of this year 😢, You Know What I’m still gonna buy it even if it’s so close to November.
All I know is, bad or good, this movie is gonna make bank for how long we've waited for it, and it'll more than likely have plenty of sequels coming down the line, based off the other games and the plethora of books.
I DARE you to do more hello neighbor
If the movie is rushed, we blame it in Matpat
6:52 I don't know man The way that other drawing overlaps the Cupcake drawing to make it look like it has a red eye is a spooker xD
Matt patt, how many words do u say w/o breathing? Lol
nope no spoilers until i have watched the moive
Watching the kid wearing stripes makes me think of the puppet and he’s the leader of the kids turned animatronics killing people (another twist maybe?)
I meant to say the fnaf movie is near my birthday
Garret is the crying child
The fnaf movie Disney my birthday
0:50 does markiplier's fnaf inspired merch count? the thing he did with his Cloak brand?
ain't no way bro solved an unreleased movie
Just gonna leave this here, Vanessa's actors real name is Elizabeth
Another plot twist: at the end of the movie it will just be MatPat doing his iconic "BUT HEY THATS JUST A THEORY. A GAME THEORY!"
That one kids shirt looks like a cup cake wrapper thing
I think the boy might be chris because of his clothing
Could you imagine all of your friends being possessed by big badass robots and you’re the frickin cupcake
Game Theory Team really looked into Instagram posts of actors for LORE, As expect of Game Theory they would search high and low for LORE
I like the idea about the Cupcake but it seems very unlikely. Not only have we seen the Cupcake move independently from Chica before in Help Wanted but there are other duo animatronic characters that do the same like Funtime Freddy and Bon Bon in Sister Location
15:06 i think the kid could be the puppet it might not be like og fnaf but this is a movie the reason i think this is the striped clothes
Still waiting for the Minecraft Movie.
Matpat trying to explain and sell what google meet does like it's a fancy new service is an experience I was not expecting.
2:35 this is probably how the animatronics "stuff you" into the suits. Only in this universe the brutally attach the parts that have unnecessary mechanics onto your body.
i hope this is gonna be a trilogy.      just like the games ;)
IT’S BEEN SO LONG    *Dun dun dundududududududndhnuhuhrwnfijetndijrnidjwrdijdedr*     *BEEN SO LOOONG*    Cook book  0:50
i love the way when you put the mixer animation springtrap stayed becuase he "always comes back"
I never expected i would see google meet ad
I personally just think that the cupcake is an extension of Chica. Plus, we have seen a version of the cupcake attacking the player, particularly the Nightmare Cupcake, or as the game calls it, Nightmare Chica. It isn’t labeled as something separate from Chica, it’s labeled as a Chica jump scare.
Bro mat pat my birthday this weekend  I can't wait to see the next theroy
Matpat across the fnafverse
I was thinking that the 5th kid was the crying child he had striped shirt and blue jeans
actually, the animatronic we see in the beginning (matthew told us hes never seen that before) is called torture freddy
Can you please make a theory about elden rings dlc
Thought he solved fnaf
I dont know, I am not That positive with The Cupcake - Kid theory..
Film and game theory have literally made me immune to their intros.I’m so proud of myself for not flipping out when I watched today’s intro.
What about the 5th kids striped top? Could it not be the Marionette?
the movie hasn’t even came out yet and you’re already making a theory about the trailer
MAT PAT PLEASE READ THIS COMMENT THE SPINING SAWS ARE TO LOCK HIS SKIN IN A ANAMATRONIC SUIT
2:36  I was on the wiki a few days ago and apparently in the books baby tried to kiss a boy but when she got close she opened up her face revealing circular saws.
I don't get the "ball pit time travel" reference... can someone please explain it to me...
Mat pat definitely predicted this one bc he predicted gvk 2021 before it even released
Brother the movie isnt even out yet
I think that the torture machine is like being stuffed in a suit in Fnaf 1 and not a remnant extractor
I’m pretty sure Matthew Lillard hashtaged his personal accounts as Afton.
I don’t know about the cupcake part. It has always been its own thing. In Help Wanted you can see the cupcake run around on its own in the parts and services game
After this video, Scott is gonna change yet again the entire plot of the movie in order to mess with Mat.   If that's the case it would be no wonder if the movie is delayed.
I always come back… Old Sport :D
Am I the only one that thinks FNaF needs to be a school subject?
It ain't even out yet
bro i didnt knew that MatPat has a son💀
The fifth kid to me is the crying child, at least for now, the stripes on the shirt remind me a lot the ones from fnaf 4
Hasany even come out bro
Imagine when the movie finally  comes out and MatPat actually was saving a surprise for cameo and that this theory actually was a mystery to the real one coming out in the film. If MatPat does make a cameo it will probably be the most lore thing to happen in all of FNAF.
only matpat could get sponsored by Google
I thought the kid in the hat was golden freddy and the other kid was freddy, but now im thinking the one in the hat is freddy and the other kid could be the marionette, purely because his shirt is darkly coloured with stripes on it?
I thought that blonde kid was meant to be the Marrionette/Puppet. They both have stripes in their designs
Why they make their own Remnant extractor we already have the femur breaker
I mean we knew this thing wouldn’t be canon to the games since the first teaser. The first step would be making our mc a rotting purple corpse and that didn’t seem to happen
Cupcake's rise to power be like:
I think they put Nebraska because for me (in kansas) if you search Freddy fazbears on google maps a location pops up in Lincoln Nebraska. Feel free to fact check its been years since i tried looking
Blud, IT HASNT EVEN CAME OUT YET?!
I don’t think that’s even springtrap yet. There’s no way they can have afton alive for half the movie, then turn him into springtrap, seemingly not in agonizing pain. And then seal I’m in the wall.   Im pretty sure that’s just afton in the beaten up spring Bonnie suit. And at the end of the film he gets springlocked.
15:16 that is EVAN AFTON aka the crying child so he IS golden Freddy
Crying child's shirt. The 5th kid's shirt.
Thanks, Google Meat!
Shaggy is William Afton not FAKE!!!!
Correct😅😅😅
Abby is also another name for Elizabeth
They always catch him off guard.  but this time, he is here to turn the tables.
MATPAT LOOK AT THE SHIRT ITS CC'S SHIRT BRO
17:57  And Afton gets springlocked, right?
the mystery kid. he has stripes????? on his shirt???? any character famous for their stripes??????????? am i really alone here????
I feel like the kid in the brown shirt is Freddy and it the yellow one, that one’s golden Freddy.
Ain’t no way bro… it hasn’t even come out and he already solved it. But that’s just a theory… (answer in the reply)
Why is balloon boy in one of the drawings?
april 7th is my bday, so congraths to scott to get that 1/366 odds i guess
I NEED IT!
Haha Google meer lol
the intro can be a mvie intro amazing work editors!!
15:28 or maybe the puppet  maybe…..
It's mèeeeeee it's. Ee..e.e.e.e.e.ee.e.e.e.e..em
Matpat can convince that we are a pineapple and it would make sense
Afton changed his name because the police will find aut that it's afton that killed the children
BRO MAT ALREADY ITS NOT EVEN YET😭
The 5 kid maybe be the puppet 15:06
To be honest i feel like secret kid is The puppet for some reason
That's springbonnie  he's wihterde because springbonnie is one of the first animatronic
I knew that cupcake was 1 of the kids
We all know the real twist is Abby was a robot all along
Wait until the movie comes out mat
scott "you want some help dealing with Matpat?" Blumhouse "nah we got this cant be too hard" Matpat "ooo look at this attempt of a misdirect"
This is why Film Theory should’ve gotten vaccinated. Now Game Theory infected it with FNAF videos!
col
The fifth child has striped shirt and the blue pants
If we don't have an end credit scene with Afton coming back to life or something (preferably with his iconic catchphrase), I'll be so disappointed.
LET HIM COOK🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
WHYYY NO OG INTROOO MAT U BREAKING MY HEART!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Scott after a matpat fnaf vid:NUH UH
I Solved the FNAF Movie! the movie coming out oct 27
My theory is that the movie will be like the vr game, I think the movie will be a movie in the lore of the games and like the vr games is being used for miss information and cover ups, one of the reasons I think this is because of vennessa, in the sb it’s said that there is no reason that she should have been hired       Because she had no job experience but someone higher up hired her anyway, but in this movie it shows vennesa working as a police officer.
matpat casually stalking a child on instagram to get FNAF lore
Nah man golden Freddy has blue eye because it's actually Sans
gotta appreciate how Matpat isn't even using the trailer most of the time but rather stalking the instagram pages of children
Boy it aint even released yet💀
how tf did i get spoiled a movie a month before release
Finding proper evidence and details to predict the plot of a film, series, etc. are not that rare. But I did in fact believed that it effected the audience reception. I guess what people failed to understand is that what we learned here is just a theory. It can be right. It can be wrong. And if it’s the latter, then I wouldn’t care much. Just hope that whatever story I’ve seen is a good story. ^^
Make a theory about gumball plz
You know who we haven’t seen? The puppet. Could the child with “no distinguishing characteristics” actually be a stripy shirted future puppet?
If I only had a dollar for every YouTube video with the words “solved” and “FnaF” in them.
Freaking amazing theories from everyone in the team!   Attempt #2 to get MatPat to watch the show “From” it’s an amazing story and it leaves you with so many questions, that I’m sure only MatPat can solve!
I don't know anything about fanf I avoid every video of fanf from you.I watch every video of yours apcet fanf theury
2:35 they are trying to put them in to a suit, in the first fnaf the dude on the phone says that if they see someone without a suit they are going try and put u in one, but obviously those suits are robots and not made for humans, you can also see in the clip that the front of that machine is a Freddy mask
Man I wonder how the heck my Matpat is still alive by now, My guys brain for real going to explode from all of them theories   💀
A bit of a stretch, what if abby is Cassidy and this is like an origin story of how Cassidy became golden Freddy.
9:02 I love Google Meat, too! use Google Meat to render employees. 😅
even google getting ads from matpat💀
the moment i saw this video i clicked it in a blink of an eye (Youtube algrothem doing its thing)
The kid's blonde hair doesn't count for Golden Freddy?
The fifth kid isnt the cupcake bro. He is blonde hair and we saw a blonde kid in ultimate costume night. And his hair bieng yellow could mean hes golden freddy
15:40   i'm suprised Matt didn't mention that Chika is holding the cupcake in her right hand and not the left like in the games, that's definately something to show it's a different universe ( minor but some slight details can be seen in changes right?)
mike abby ----    =   michael baby ---- BRUHHHH
I wouldnt have known about fnaf untill I saw one of your theroy vids
Game Theory (theory)  Matt already solved fnaf 3 years ago and is just holding back for content and money (real)
Nowadays I only go to the movies to see if matpat was right
What if that kid is crying child because of lined shirt
That second boy looked like the crying child
She becomes the cupcake?
I just noticed the fifth kid that Matpat is theorizing to be the cupcake has a striped t-shirt like Crying Child!
The fact Google Meet is sponsoring Matpat is crazy
🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬜⬛🟪⬜⬛ 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛ 🟪🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛
you know you've succeeded when google meet sponsors you
Literally its relasing after 27 October like one day before my b-day
Style Theory idea: How effective is a springlock suit
Dead meat gonna make a crazy video
I personally think the Freddy's are the other way around - I mean, wouldn't you say gold is a lighter colour than brown? And Golden Freddy also wears a top hat, so why is everyone so certain that _this_ kid is Freddy? The boy in brown is Freddy and the boy with the top hat and lighter coloured shirt (what of it we can see over Mike's shoulder) is Golden Freddy, imo.
it hasnt come out yet and bros making a theory of it
@THE FLIM THEORY  can you make a video about how many anime character can lift the mionir please
Read my comments they have lore
You've won over Scott
My man didn’t realise that my odd one out is golden Freddy due to the striped shirt or puppet
Are you telling me that the cupcake just leaps off the plate cause magic and kills someone despite having no limbs or mouth? That sounds ridiculously absurd
🎶Back for another biiiite🎶
Hey mat     I found a channel continuing the lore of the back rooms And the channal's name is trendwatch and there is also another vid by kane pixels of the back rooms
17:26   Nah, they definitely smoking something.
Wow I had no idea they were making a FNAF movie!!!! That’s awesome, an way to break down the lore good sir
I'm very salty because the fnaf movie is only coming out in November 1st in my country so I'll be missing out for 4 days before anything happens
Your mind is good Mr. Patrick. Maybe you should have been on either the cast or the crew. Your theories should have caught their attention
WILLIAM USED GOOGLE MEET TO GET THE KIDS ITS ALL COMING TOGETHER
Bro it did even come out yet
i thought that the last kid was the crying kid
matpat needs some sort of appearance in this movie after everything he’s done for the series
Like, zoinks Scoob, my skin is looking purple
Matpat is chicka stand in he was the first he has seen everything
Name one time when Matpat doesn’t theorize before  it’s come out and when it does Atleast 5 times lol
what happend to cassidy
I’ve used google meet for about 2 years
question for the people who watched this video. are you gonna be bummed out if matt was correct, or not?? considering most movie-loving people hate spoiler
whether the movie follows this plot or not im sure it’s going to be fun and enjoyable for fans.
i think the movie is gonna be a kids movie and not scary at all
I like that the 4 brothers are fighting to get the most subscribers
I would imagine the 5th child is the security puppet.
How did-- how did you figure the lore out when the movie isn't even released 💀💀
Fnaf always comes back
I think the “extractor” is a dream.  Along with the kids in the woods.  He’s having nightmares between shifts.
Nobody talking about how William is in the spring Bonnie suit? He hasn’t gotten springlocked yet, I think we all know where this is going
Yo I haven't watched this yet but I know its true
I feel like the Nebraska thing could be one of 4 things.  1. What matt said 2. It's Mike's hometown 3. Just a random thing put in there (highly unlikely obviously) 4.  something happened in Nebraska that will either effect the movie or future games
steveraglan in an anagram machine brings up interesting words like - salvage, eternal, enslaver, strangle, avenger. maybe Steve Raglan is just a clever way to mask the big bad
can't the top hat kid be golden freddy and the last kid is freddy? because freddy is brown and golden freddy is...golden?
I mean the kids are in anamatronic costumes maybe that can be fashion
He’s secretly working on the real thing
Just gonna write this before my first viewing that my theory for the movie and it’s trilogy would be an accurate retelling of the real story of fnaf that of which the “indie dev” that was hired by Freddy’s to make the first 4 or 5 games excluding pizza sim and ucn (which could possibly explain the minor or major costume differences, except with spring trap aka jimmy neutron) this also clears up how in fnaf vr they would have gotten the assets for nightmare fredbear (since ya know the whole illusion disk traumatising mike) since it would have been a made up story from the indie dev, if they do choose this route then this would uhhhh really throw a spanner in the works for your timeline huh? Though this is most definitely NOT how they will play it out it is a fun way to think of how it could go. Also going to enjoy what you think of this movie.
You should do a theory on the K-12 movie by Melanie Martinez
The fiiiiilm theory
Again… yay
Evan afton:
Thank God, I waited for this episode so that I don't have to watch 3 hours of fluffy death robots
Uh Mat want to do a fnaf style theory why not do a outfit design based on the fnaf characters and see how practical they are to move around in and see out of if you make masks to go with it?
MATTHEW ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET
Didn’t baby have like saws coming out her face in I think the fourth closet?
Mat I love ya I've been waiting for this to be released watched it and now gonna go to school and explain fnaf movie theory lol
If there isn't a reference to matpat it would be waste
I think the 5th kid is actually the puppet, and they're just not showing it in the trailer- the stripey shirt is doing most of the heavy lifting here, I'll admit.  It would make sense if they left out the story of Henry and Charlie for streamlining purposes, or if they wanted to included it in a sequel, it's not too much work to just make Charlie a boy.
I'm almost certain that Afton will be springlocked in this movie!
Imagine if Cassidy ends up being the cupcake spirit
I want a last of us theory 3 prediction or just something about last of us
You sound like that guy from dead meat
Mat the Marrinate the puppet
I know Mat might not see this, and I don't know if this has already been answered, but I am really dying to know, since the movie and the game are canon, and they tell separate stories from what we know.. which of them is the REAL story? cause I think Scott might be mixing lore together giving us two stories, leaving us to determine which one is the completely canon story. or.. what if they are both canon and we just need to pick the right ingredients to find out what the actual story is?
you know from afton family that becomes golden freddy
the fifth ghost child is the crying child
WHY THE HECK IS A CHILD POSTING ON INSTAGRAM😂
My theory: The scene with robbers was the last scene and Abby turned into the cupcake
Watch, like most of patmat's predictions,it's likely gonna be totally wrong.
The jumpscare got me
Blumehouse watching this:👁️👄👁️
the fifth kid is wearing a stripped shirt, what if hes the puppet
11:00 i have a nokia💀
bro made a theory before even the movie comes out
There can easily be a style theory video on how to make better and safer springlock suits
Fun Fact: This Is The First Official 3D Springbonnie That We See in The ENTIRE FRANCHISE (Excluding FNAF world)
if you look at 1:18 of the movie trailer and see that saw looking thing, its in the shape of a Freddy head.. maybe mike is gonna be in the movie canon golden / shadow Freddy? considering that shadow Freddy / bonnie were nightguards that wouldn't be surprising
If the cupcake is in fact another kid, it could be linked to the stitchwraith story, or the way that bon bon is in fnaf 5, as we know that multiple souls can possess one animatronic,a and they may be collapsing the storyline like you say
The boy is In a striped shirt, maybe he is puppet?
Matpat did you watch the lore video animation that someone made
Ok just here me out but what is if this kid 15:01 is the marionette my mind went straight to that cuz of the stripes shirt but it just a theory
3Bucks if all this is true.
I think the 5th kid is golden Freddy he not only has the right color clothes (as they all do) but he looks an awful lot like The vengeful spirit from UCN
My theory, mike got killed then possessed golden Freddy
RRRRRemnant!!
The movie isn't even out and they've already got the lore. Lets just pray they don't see this and we don't have another security breach situation.
So we can actually get a 4 way FNAF theory.
FINALLY! a Film theory on FNAF... 2 more channels... Food theory and Style theory...
The 5th kid is probably the Puppet. Because of the striped shirt
im impressed he can do all of this with just ONE trailer
Soon there's gonna be a fnaf food theory and why animatronic suits are good for you in style theory
This guy can keep his theories to himself, I'm waiting on the new Fnaf film and I'm going to watch it, end of story.
bro solved it before it even came out LOOL
Golden Freddy is clearly Sans, just look at the eyes.
Man your scripting is usually so flawless that "Google meets incredible" wrinkled my brain lol! I loved the video Matt, keep up the great work!
the child  without any specific costume has stripes on his shirt, he could be the crying child or the puppet.
Chill bro the movie hasnt even released yet
I was thinking they where gonna put mike into the suit and that thing was just a more cinematic scooper
imo the kid with the top hat is golden freddy because hes wearing yellow and we see that when they were running
Thank you Scott coffin (I want to get pinned for the chain)
Matpat literally made 60 fanf videos than anybody on YouTube. This guy is insane🤯
5 kid is proble popet
Us if this theory is wrong: "ahah you were wrong 🤡"  Us if this theory is right: "you spoiled me the movie 🤬"
Scot on his way to change the entire script of the movie because mat pat guessed the original:
even on this channel its fnaf
i really feel like the kid with the BROWN striped shirt is freddy and the kid with the YELLOW clothes and top hate is golden freddy
OH GOD HE'S DONE IT AGAIN
Ok but that thumbnail is SO GOOD.  Well done team
5-th Ghost child has striped shirt,too
lol i use google meet often with my friends who cant use discord
it messes me up how deep this man goes into his theories
U didn't pay enough attention to the child that u posed the cupcake... His shirt brown hair=crying child
Hi
Less fnaf please
bro the movie hasnt even come out yet and he already solved it.
ok so Mr.Matpat I still have one question WHY AREN'T YOU THE MAIN CHARACTER IN THE FNAF MOVIE???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what if the fifth child is the puppet?
Did anyone else notice that the extra kids shirt is strippy kinda like the security puppet
So now we have the game and book timelines and then the film timeline 🤒🤒🤒
it's the scoop room bud 2:51
We have final part of aot coming up and fnaf
Google meet
Waiting for matt patt to solve fnaf in food theory HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I think when shmidt is getting sawed his soul is gonna be in golden freddy
Oh yeah, this will confirm the FNAF 4 was the bite of 87 and not 83 BS
Was the time travel in the ball pit a reference to BanBan?
My theroy about gang is that it’s really just some kids nightmares
that's a true deep dive
can you do smg4
Actually that fifth kid might be the crying child because you didnt pay attention to what his wearing the stripes of his top like the crying child made sense to me
You know, I use to hate matpat, but now that I know he uses Android. He's alright
Hope y'all get to see the movie with your family, blessings
I cant watch it😢😢because 3 days after my the movie releases its my exam
Oh never mind
Wait the movies out now!?
Unlike what Matt said, there are a few interesting details on the poster wall. Noticeably a drawing of two yellow mascots performing on a brown stage. (STAGE-01?)
M3ME
I was aware of FNAF, but never played the games nor watched your theories until your 4 part timeline. I just naturally lived under a rock and don’t pay attention to what’s “popular”.
This was a really good theory. Only thing I disagree on is Abby becoming baby. Also about the line “they want to make her like them” I think it’s referring to William. You see in the silver eyes it’s shown as long as Afton is wearing the Spring Bonnie suit the animatronics don’t attack him as they see him as one of them which gives Afton the opportunity to make Abby like the other animatronics.
I just realized something. The fifth kid in the trailer might be the crying child.
What if the wall is an easter egg to all the fans that sent scott fan art? 6:54
THE ORANGE
No no no more baby
15:21 the short just made me think that it was going to be the crying child, even though it would’ve make much sense
Cupcake has to be a dog. A pitbull, especially. Why would it not be a pitbull named Cupcake?
0:05 uhh guys is this freddy fazbear? Har har har har har har har har har har
It haven’t came out yet😂
Matpat is the kind of guy to read your movie script out loud in a cinema when the entire cast is present.    Get me to 1k likes or else I won’t pet my cat :)
LESS GOOOOO 🗣️🔥🗣️🔥🗣️🔥
Shouldn’t It be cry kid
the kid who you thought was cupcake could possibly william aftons kid because he has a striped shirt just like in the games
Lol if yall think the move would have a happy ending than you haven't read the books most of the stories almost everyone died
Could the kid be the puppet?? Just because stripes on his shirt
OMG YOU ARE THE BESTTTTTTT
ok, so FNAF has crossed from Game Theory to Food Theory and now to Film Theory. To round the bases Style Theory can do an eppisode on how to beat the heat in a mascot suit.
I've not see the whole of the video yet but the 5th kid at 16:00 has a stripey shirt, like the crying child, weird. but then again he doesn't have brown hair
Wait you said golden freddy is freddy? I think, Right???
I’m really excited for the movie! I cant waittttt
I genuinely hope that when I'm in the theater watching fnaf l, that I see matpat
15:19 (Just a theory) So, Matpat said that the mysterious child is going to be the cupcake. Although for me it's someone else. I think it would be the crying child. I believe this because of the clothing and features, the hair is a brown colour like the crying child, the stripy shirt, and the blue pants. This is most definitely the crying child for me because with the evidence here it is clear that this is the crying child. Although it maybe not due to the other features overlapping like the hair colour is not perfect, its more light than dark.
I love that William is in the trailer laughing menacly in a giagantic iron suit en then he pulls out a kitchen knive
17:19 it would also explain fnaf 4 with the crying child being experimented on like he got captured and was forced to live in that home and that’s why his parents are okay with his brother being so mean
11:13 that’s a deep ball pit if it can fit most of the animatronic bodies in it
I have a theory get this get this it’s in an alternate universe
Wait, how long has Matt pat been a dad?
15:33 puppet
I have a theory Remember the twist in the book where the girl who thought her brother got kidnapped is actually the one who got kidnapped?I think that's what happened to him since his the Michael we know yet his dad is not willam and just like the "he is not My son" situation from the game the one we thought was the big bad is not the big bad and instead the one who kidnapped Michael is,WHAT IF THE MOVIE IS SOLVING THE GAMES LORE 😱
that jumpscare....really??? matt pat, do better (im jp but still not scary, we know what we clicked on)
Am I only one that the film is released after my birthday 25th oct
Maybe instead of them teaming up, Mike and Vanessa destroy the robots which releases the spirits of the dead kids and they somehow get the springlock suite to malfunction with Steve Raglan inside, and we know that he will “always come back” which sets us up for the sequel.
I think the blue eye of G. Freddy has less to do with the fact that he is good and more so with Garrett being a fan of the hit game series "Mother"
sponsored by GOOGLE MEET!?!
5:24 Nahhh I'm still with my afton is his father theory bruh
how about stealing that game theroy from protomario and giveing no credit?
37 days left guys
Aye it comes on my b day
I didn't even see Mathew Lilard signed for 3 FNAF movies. I kinda figured they'd want to do sequels but I'm worried they're jumping the gun. I WANT the movie to be good, but video game movies are hard to get right.
I mean a wearable animatronic just seems perfect for a fashion theory in of itself
YAY
This guy can solve anything And its not even out yet
The subtitles really said “5 minutes at Freddy’s”
The fifth kid looks like the crying child  Hes even wearing a stripped shirt 15:08
Can you imagine if the twist ends up being that the guy playing Mike's dad turns out to be his step dad instead and in some starwars type call back Afton in the Spring Trap costume tells him he's his real father.
Isn't the extra child either the puppet or the crying child not the cupcake? He's wearing the stripes and that's all I can see 😅
this has all been said before man
I think the "remnant extrator" might just be something else i mean see that there's some brown at the back of it i think it's a mask they are making new animatronic's there's even a hat it's a freddy mask
The last kid is the puppet bc he had a striped shirt
Maybe the kid in stripes is the puppet? 15:15
This rip is great but it makes me really wish we got more SOT rips because the soundtrack slaps
I wanted to yell "...Game theory" at the end, but then it just came out as "Gilm theory" becouse i remembered this is Film theory.
The moment we w all bin waitin for
Bro just cant escape from fnaf 💀😭😭
Matpat, chill! The movie isn't even out yet!
I would say the 5th kid is balloon boy
The kid has a striped shirt. He's the puppet!
you forgot that golden freddy can have 2 souls at once so mikes brother and that one other kid   also when chica eyes aren't glowing the cupcakes are so it should be the former of the two thing you said
the movie its scotts last project after that no more fnaf
Noaaaaa bro îs în love fnaf
4:10 IS THAT THE MARKIPLIER FROM AUGUST 13TH 2014???!?!
Actually I think the cupcake are Suzies dog, the way it attacks works for this too🤔
that drawing might be the one in the last lore book that the kid drew
6.1k
Ima be honest, until the movie started looking okay FNAF just became YouTube junk food for me. Meaning I'd occasionally binge FNAF content to catch up on whatever I've missed, then go back to cringing at its existence.  I think FNAF 3 was the last time I was *really* into it and Pizzeria Sim was the last time I was actually invested in the story.  The movie though... Does look really interesting.
Anyone know the true story that birthed the FNAF Game Franchise?  I do.  A mentally deranged employee at a Chuck - E - Cheese Pizzeria kidnapped kids from parties hosted at said restaurant, murdered them & UGH!  🤢🤮  SERVED THEM UP IN HIS PIZZAS!  A customer found a child's finger in their pizza & kicked up 1 helluva fuss & the Police were called.  Said worker was arrested & was discovered to actually believe he was Chuck - E himself & in his demented state wanted to create the perfect pizza.  If he didn't get Ed Gein's punishment I don't know what happened to him.
15:27 hes lost his mind
I've always had a theory since that first image with golden febby that Abby was him or baby in some sense.
THE FIFTH KID IS THE PUPPET!
I think golden Freddy is mike
I loved fnaf, but anything after fnaf 6 and ucn is not Canon to me, i still love fnaf but im more of a casual fan now
8:46  I thought this was not offical though since it was a programmed memory in robot Charlie’s brain
Been waiting for this.  *turns lights on*
Ever since scott has been cancled and bullied out of his own franchise, fnaf has a sour taste for me...
bro solved the movie before it airs💀💀💀💀💀
I can’t imagine matt missed the striped shirt the kid was wearing z  So I’m pretty sure he’s misdirecting us this time XD
ohhhhh SISTER location, make sense
Oh god not here too! Welp Time to play the Matpat drinking game.
IT AINT EVEN OUT
So we just gonna ignore the fact that CoryKenshin is in the Fnaf movie
You really want to know how I had no idea of this 'FNAF' till early this year? Well, it's very simple..... I DIDN'T CARE!!!!! But I still appreciate the cool content. Thanks Theorists :)
i ALWAYS COME BACK
Is no one rhyming nanny and and vanny no one? Ok😅
IS CASSIDY BABY?
Cool, now I know what happens I don't have to go watch it! Thanks Matty Patty
Dang I had a theory similar to this on his sub Reddit years back when sister location released. Everyone was theorizing and tearing into that game at release, but yet no one looking at the soap opera cartoon segments in that game at the time and brushed those off as a funny put in for fun, where I believed it was put in intentionally and would make sense. Give some family drama between the co owners of Freddy’s where maybe like William had an affair with Henry’s wife and had a kid but he kept denying when it wife confronted him and ended up killing her to just get rid the problem entirely and it set the ball in motion for the whole tragedy of events of the series….kinda hard fit that in timeline now with games that released after sister location. But if I just played 1-sister location it’d make so much sense.
I think this is Vanessa before she was possessed or who she becomes in security breach.  P.S Also I swear in one of the games there was a jump scare with the cupcake.
Now, how many times have I seen this kind of title?😂
Okay
At this point matpat could make a ARG that includes the tally marks at the end of Ruin
I think Vanessa is a bad guy personally, but she's pretending to be good. She wants Mike to think it's all the animatronics when it's really Afton.
Until he said "video calling service" I thought he was talking about Google Meat, one of those new meat delivery services popping up everywhere.  I guess I should actually watch the video instead of just listening.
this guy should be in the movie but we should not get our hopes up
Ngl that kid in the front being Golden Freddy becomes a lot more believable when you notice his t-shirt is striped like the crying child from FnaF 4.
I have a prediction of my own about the franchise: This first film will tend to be called by the familiar acronym, FNAF. The sequel will officially be called "Another Five Nights At Freddy's", abbreviated to AFNAF. Then film 3 will be called "Yet Another Five Nights At Freddy's", i.e. YAFNAF. The acronym will grow with each new sequel until, inevitably: "Yes, It's Freaking Finished, You Are Finally Free, For Now Into Forever, Final Night At Freddy's". YIFFYAFFFNIFFNAF (Give a bear a bow)
But why would the kid possess a cup cake the whole reason the animatronics are possessed is because William had to hide them somewhere
Oh! I never noticed the editing, i love them :D
Aint nobody talking about how this man got sponsored by google meet 😂
I bo- actually who am I kidding? I can't watch the movie
oh no the animatronics are everywhere now there's no escape Everyone run 😂😂😂
The last kid is probably Evan (crying child) striped shirt blue pants the dots are connecting a little too well.
I've been watching the fnaf series on Game Theory since I was a literal child in 2014 and the idea that there are new fans who joined in Security Breach is just-
HOW HOW DID HE DO THIS THE MOVIE ISN'T EVEN OUT YET
could be that we were wrong about all the mikes being the same mike..?
But there is one more puzzle left. Female villain who is that
Looking forward to the next "finally solved it" vid after the movie comes out
Film theorists is now gonna be fnaf when the movie releases
I don't even know how long I've been watching these fnaf videos for but it literally NEVER gets old
OH MY GOD IT HASN'T EVEN COME OUT YET STOP
Leave it to Matpat to solve the fnaf movie before it even comes out
The living tombstone plays video games too??  Shocking
why does the cgi look so bad?
Bro explained entire movie before it came out💀
homie it ain’t even out yet 💀
Theory idea: Could any of the animatronic suits be worn by humans
Movie producers be like: Ah yes, he finally uploaded the script for us.
0:50 that is the EXACT freddy costume I got one Halloween
doesnt the fifth kid look like the crying child??? the striped shirt and pants
Matpat I think you made this series so mutch bigger than it was 😂😂😂
fnaf fashion ? you mean like something you put on ? like a suit ? a suit that would lock with springs ? THE SCIENCE OF SPRINGLOCK SUITS ??
child might be puppet, he has stripes on his shirt
POV: You stuff a dead kid in a cupcake
can you do a elemental lore video
I did as soon as the trailer came out 💀💀💀💀
Im betting theres gonna be lore hidden in the end credits
The FNAF plague is spreading
I would like to know if you ever considered a music theory
what do you mean you solved it I aint even watch it yet💀
Bro I forgot that this was a movie
When I saw the Trailer I first thought the fith child might of been the bite victim, The striped shirt mainly linking the two together, as always amazing Video matpat love watching them :)
Mat is the type of person to solve a movie before it's even came out 💀
The child with the top hat is actually golden Freddy since his shirt is yellow, and Freddy is the kid next to bonnie and foxy since his shirt is brown, ( also golden Freddy child is behind mike showing he’s the odd one out )
two things I think I want to note is that firstly, the boy in the scene with no definitive identity is wearing similar clothes to C.C. also, in the novels the animatronics tried to protect Jason, since he was a kid, and that might also mean something for Abby and the animatronics relationship.
15:30 marker, Matt I think you're close. The way he's dressed he looks like The Marrionette.
Man matpat you must have a lot of preview vids because I haven’t seen any vid showing I’ve seen the trailer but I can’t wait until the film tho
i hda a fnaf once poor feller died of hungry
13:29 me and the boys be like
Wait isn’t matpat in the movie tho…
Who’s excited for the this film 👇
I know this doesn't make any sense based on this theory but the mysterious 5th child (that matpat says is the cupcake) looks like the crying child. Same clothes but different hair.
this belongs on gametheory
My theory: Abby looks at the balloon boy drawing, and they say hello like BB, ABBY HAS BB IN HER NAME! ABBY IS BALLOON BOY
Ah yes the biggest goal of moving from Utah to Nebraska
Like so Matpat can see !!! I think that the thing with saws that attacks Mike is a robot with its face opened up like in the Fourth Closet Graphic novel
“I solved the FNAF movie” but- didn’t you solve the game-
BRO IT AIN'T EVEN OUT FOR AN ENTIRE MONTH
I'm surprised MatPat has not made a Coraline theory.
IVE BEEN WATCHING GAME THEORY FOR ALMOST A DECADE!? I started watching since the third games theories came out. 8 years…. 8 YEARS
Couldn’t the fifth kid be one of golden Freddie’s 2 different souls? One Cassidy and the other  a crying child?
the “cupcake” is wearing a striped shirt, you know what that means
I've only actually seem FNAF on this channel .. Probably because I mostly watch random stuff and minecraft so yeah-
i think that the 5th child is crying child cuz stripes
For the cupcake thing, how could William Afton stuff a kid inside the cupcake so it can become possessed
but if matthew lilard is William afton that means he would know his voice UNLESS the "dad" of the main character is his stepdad and he never got to know his real dad who was the one who recruited him, just my theory tho
MatPat is getting flashbacks
*I swear to god, If the fnaf movie gets delayed by this, then you can call me purple guy...*
he told the story, now i dont wanna watch the movie
Anybody else thought that Abby was Mike’s daughter?
Food theory with fnaf cookbook: Freddy's killer pizza!
Bro the movie hasnt even released and he's already solving everything💀💀💀🪑🪑🪑
Matt pat we went with a lot of theories but a kid in a small cupcake?
1:13 Tbf mat i was introduced to the games not from youtube, even tho i've been watching yt since 2008, but from friend. It was after Qur'an recitation class at my local mosque, my friends whip out his phone and start to talk about how scary the games he bout to play in his phone.
Aww Bonnie’s so cute
early
Lets see if its better than Willies wonderland
Oh for crying out loud. Now they'll have to rewrite the plot and delay it so no spoilers can happen because he *DEFINITELY* got it right.
I doubt “They want to make her like them” is actually not what they’re trying to do
How can the soul possess the cupcake when the bodies get stuffed in the suits then possess that character?  He didn't stuff 1 in a cupcake...
That Google ad was just simply off. 👌      Good Theory
This is the day of rapture for the Theorist channels.
Definitely think that mike is gonna die and be trapped in gold Freddy since he has 1 blue eye and the other one is off and once his sister dies then she will be in the suit with him
The fiveth kid looks similar to the 'crying child' the shirt is somewhat the same tho the kid is blond and the crying child is said to be brunette..it's just what I think tho
Wow that could definitely be true
I think the 5th child who doesn't have any explicit characteristic linking to him is Freddy. The kid with the top hat is golden Freddy because he has a yellow striped shirt. There isn't another child in the cupcake, the ghost that's in Chica, who is named Susie had a dog. If that kid in the brown shirt was the cupcake then he would have a pink shirt which would explicity show us that he is the cupcake. I was searching on Google which ghost kid possesses the cupcake and nothing comes up, but the only thing that comes up on who the dog possesses is Mangle which to me doesn't make any sense. So I think that the dog possesses the cupcake.
cool video, not watching it until the movie comes put tho lol
It's like I don't want to watch the movie anymore cause everything has been spoiled. I'm still gonna watch it to know whether Mat is wrong or not haha.
In the fourth closet, the souls were able to influence more than one animatronic. This can be seen when Susie, Chica’s spirit was able to control the mangle, while still trapped in the amalgamation that houses the OG animatronics. So the cupcake in the movie might not be possessed by a different kid. It’s still Chica’s spirit having influence and control of both animatronic bodies.
Man I love how there is a full two Mins of sponsorship.
Man... that child actor's gonna be in SO MUCH TROUBLE for leaking this if it's true.    Assuming they aren't already, and we're only putting the extra cherry on top.
I hate to be that guy, but almost every horror movie never ends with them happy and smiling. So, this movie is probably going exactly how most do🤓👆
Suzies dead dog is definitely the cupcake
The fifth kid has a striped shirt, like crying child or the puppet
Hold on wasn’t William Afton Michael Aftons dad? And wasn’t  his sister called Elizabeth?
Finally Hasbro is going to revive transformers wfc and foc so in 2017 these 2 games disappear now these games  are going to be in steam
Watch them redo the entire plot after this video 😭☠️
10h
Imagine a multi BILLION dollar company feeling the need to do a sponsorship. It's Google, the company that owns YouTube. If you are watching the sponsorship section, you are already paying them. Like seriously Google, are you ok? Do you need some cash?
Saying the kid is the cupcake might be the most sane thing to come out of Mat's mouth in the last 9 years
Wait, Mike is the Oldest then comes His brother then Sister, HOLD ON! Are they the Afton Kids? Its in order, basically The Younger brother vanished 10 years ago prompting that Abby is the youngest so, Afton Kids anyone?
I cannot wait for the Food Theory FNAF video where he has to dissect the hidden lore in the FNAF cookbook
One thing, I think this Vanessa cam't be yhe same Vamessa as the guard in security breach, because we know the latter has no 'relevant experience' for being a security guard and the former was a police officer, which I would deem pretty relevant when you're a security guard
Hey I'm early!
I hope matpat get a reference in the movie
5th kid is wearing the puppet stripes. The first animatronic was the puppet who then gave life to the others as shown in the fnaf 2 mini game. Also according to book lore, the animatronics would be protective of Abby as shown in the first book when Foxy protects Abby from William Afton. Lots of holes in this theory that don’t make much sense Mat, good try though.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
my favorite part was that they all used android phones
Bro it's not even out yet CHILL
Broski the movie ain’t out yet
1:10 well my secret was that when fnaf came out and so so many people were playing it, i avoided it by strictly only watching the videos that i already liked and when ever i saw one or two videos that i wasnt familiar with i ignored it and eventually the youtube algiritim only gave me what i wanted and nothing else.
In the end mattpat looses and Freddy wins
you wish you coud  eber solve this franchyse but let's be real Scott is gonna add 5 more monochromatic characters and 12 new robot kids soooo... you've just gotten yourself an endless money and headache supply
Blub
You better be in it
Is it just me or does the fifth child looks like he's dressed like crying child?
15:09 The fact that MatPat did not draw a parallel between this kid and the crying Child is weird, especially because of the striped shirt he was constantly talking about in his old theories. XD
help how did he do this so fast
Wow almost exactly 10% of this video was an add for Google
I believe the fifth child isn't the cupcake, instead its more likely to be the puppet with its symbol being the stripped shirt.
0:27 I wish he said always comes back lol
15:05 he is obviously the puppet with his costume design
Food theory: FREDDYS PIZZA EXIST style theory WE MAKE FREDDYS HEAD
Matpat we can always count on you. Keep thos ball rolling
I'm confused of where casidy comes in, maybe in the sequel.
Or maybe the Aftons once came from Nabraska. 5:16
This is bad two different channels with FNAF lets hope it wont spread to any more of his channels.
Is you Matt pat is the purple Guy is going to happen I am on to you Matt 😂
I have such low expectations for this movie😭
I think it would be really funny if the cupcake actually ended up being Susie's dog
There has a lot crazy stuff going on in Utah.
The only reason matt isn't in the movie is because the movie creators are sadists who want to see matt suffer trying to solve the lore
But what portion
Game theory - the games/books Film theory - the movie  Food theory - the cookbook mostly pizza Fashion - mascot costumes and forensics
No you didn't
9:33 "Because meet slots in"   Heh.
Oh no fnafs made it to film theory!!!!🥲🥲🥲🤬🤬
To be fair, I've never watched any FNAF gameplay or played the games myself. The only reason I know so much about it is from watching all of MatPat's videos.
Missed opportunity to put a golden cupcake into the scene at 6:21 for an easter egg.  Or not  I dunno.  Might be.
He has descended into insanity now...
Dude the movie hasn't even gotten out yet and you already making videos on it bruhhh
it’s so silly that the cupcake could have a soul lol
We need the movie to end with matpat saying “BUT THATS JUST A THEORY, A GAME THEORY! thanks for watching”
I was made 1.1 go up to 1.2 m views
You did it wrong in the intro! You should have said: its been so long. Refering to the song from living thumbstone
It’s not even out lol
the blender is nightmare freddy
this a fraction of what matpat can do, he can solve a movie thats not even released yet
OH GOD HES AT IT AGAIN!
I LOVE THIS MEME MATT PATTTT! 17:14
Matthew Lillard was at Denver Fan Expo and signed my Springtrap Pop saying " I always come back." So, I think you got the ending for sure and knowing he signed 3 Movie deal. "He always comes back."
I know the real problem whith this film it’s in America and teh Gard donat have a gun? Yeah real likely
Petition to force matpat to go a month without taking about fnaf
What?
How did you now my birth date 2015 april 7
I don’t know about the cupcake kid I mean he has a striped shirt so y’know
ah thanks to mat pat the movie will make a reshoot.
🟨 🟨🟨🧁 🟨
Cupcake kid has a striped shirt, just like Evan. I think this is a double fake out and he is in fact golden Freddy
thank you, matt patttttttt! "just a dream" by nelly is my favorite song... 14:16
I think that one kid is The crying child becaus of his shirt
I want to see the spring lock screen I hopw it will be Included in the movie
Can’t change the lore of this one Scott.
⬛️ 🟫 🟫🟫🎤 🟫
I knew the cupcake was evil
Matpat it is actually a torture device created by william for the night night guards
In regards to Matthew Lillard’s character, although it’s imperfect. Steve Raglan is one letter away from being an anagram of ‘everlasting’. This would fit in thematically with Aftons refusal to die/ always finding his way back into the franchise
That kid with the striped shirt is probably the puppet or the crying kid. The outfit is similar.
The cupcake could be a dog, like the soul of her dog that William lured her in with
What if the cupcake was possessed by susie’s dog?
I don't know how this is a theory, everything was said in the trailer.
That fifth kid had a striped shirt, which is most commonly associated with the Crying Child, tho it might be a different kid filling that role since Mike's brother is clearly shone in a different flashback with brown hair, while the kid is blonde  I suspect this is the other half of Golden Freddy like in the books, or this must be Cassidy who, for some reason, might have taken on a mix of gold(blonde hair) and stripes
Love how part of the theory is kinda just stalking actor's socials
Years, so many years and it’s so close
that kid (the one who is the cupcake) looks like the crying child
another year another day for matpat to decent into madness about animatronics going quirky at night
1:13 ... honestly if you wouldn't be making Minecraft theories I would never be here and find out about FNAF . So yeah it's your fault people know about this 🤣🤣🤣
NAH BRO I AIN'T WATCHIN THIS NO SPOILERS
Abby getting killed by Baby in a post credits scene or something would be crazy I really hope they go that route
This is considered as a spoiler
4:11 love how you can tell that's Markiplier's silhouette 😂😂😂😂
Well i think that Hank because his actor said he was still alive i think that hank will come out throw water on the spring Bonnie suit and Afton is dead and when the animatronics hear Afton’s voice they grab Afton’s body and drag it away
It is a disgrace to society if your not in it
I work at Spirit, and weve already got the FNAF costumes. We got Eveyone except Foxy. Chicka and Bonny. Which im sad for but still excited about!
I think it would be cooler that if at the end, once the animatronics turn on him, something short circuits his suit, and we can get the spring lock failure scene😮
Cupcake added the bite of 23 I guess
what have you done matpat now scott is going to postpone this movie for another 8 years just to make sure your theory isnt remotely correct
I haven't watched a film theory in at least 5 years.
yoo I live in utah I'm glad to be a part of the fnaf series XD
I assumed the kid in the striped shirt was the puppet that they just didn't show in the trailer. I really hope they're not the cupcake 😂
Personally i believe the 5th kid was freddy cause his t shirt is brown and the one wearing the top hat is golden freddy cause the kid wearing the top hat is wearing a yellow t shirt
15:05 last kid is wearing a striped shirt, marionette maybe
When the movie comes out matpat need to do a 4 way Fnaf themed crossover episode
You should do a style theory on cosplay and make your own fnaf cosplay
1:25.................. Let's GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I hope if their a second movie the puppet will be in it I love the puppet it's my favorite
The 5th kid could be puppet? The stripy shirt minds of puppet and it could be a twist but im not sure
Show us your screentime
If we're being fair everyone thinks Carl, the cupcake, can move on his own and it is something that has been used in fnaf 4 so I doubt anyone is the soul for Carl but we'll see plus that's just my opinion
Well i think carl is possessed by susie aka chica’s dog
this is like a spoiler without spoilers
3:05 there’s a possibility that the ‘buzzsaw freddy mask’ is head they put u in a game over which is y ur eyes sticks out of ur head
alr
I'm really sorry matpat but I won't to go Blind in the FNAF movie.i have waited 8 years for this.i won't watch this theory,but thanks
it would've been surprisong if someone DIDN'T get kidnapped..
Could you imagine if matpat is right and then they just delay the hole movie
The guy signing a 3 year deal? Fnaf 1-2-3. The reason it aint 4 is cause fnaf 3 gets burned down william ded (not for long). Or there just gonna end it on the third one
my question is how are both spring Bonnie and Springtrap in the first movie? are they two different or the same person?
At the end its going to be revealed that Garret is actually a surname or something and that his real name is... Cassidy.
If they show crying child get Bit by Golden Freddy you know what that means Was that the bite of 87
Bro, solved the movie before it came out
Thank you Film Theorists for spoiling the entire movie before it even comes out!
Me when I heard that the cupcake might be the fifth child. What I was imagining : ( william : blends the dead body into a meat liquid and pours into the cupcake )
the fifth kid could be the "crying child". stiped shirt and depressed looking
Fashion theory idea: idk something about springlock failure and not being safe
7:27 could also be a Dave case
There was a fnaf movie?
Matthew Lillard literally said he was playing William Afton
finish petscop it has being 4 years
BRO WAIT TILL IT RELEASES
(15:15) THE KID HAS THE STRIPPED SHIRT AND THE JEANS ITS THE CRYING CHILD YOU SEIIGSRHGYSGHBYGB SUGBYUFVYAWFEVYEVFYAVYEFYHGFYEYF >:(((   fr tho matpat, you are someone who pays attention to clothing. I am disappointed.
if any more theories involve the cupcake they could also qualify for food theory.
2:35  I can’t remember the name of the specific animatronic off the top of my head I think it was some sort of Molten Freddy but in the books there is a child who gets pulled inside the animatronic and has to chose a way to die or something along those lines but I think that this saw contraption is related to that but I like matpats theory aswell
Oh great, now the movie will be pushed back 2 years to 2025 because Blumhouse needs to remake the whole movie now that MatPat spoiled it entirely and perfectly.
Style theory idea  Would the spring lock suit be possible in real life and how would it be made?
Unidentified child is wearing crying child's jersey
If he doesn’t get springlocked I’m gonna be disappointed
google meet what you doin?
they going to change the movie again?
He's at it again.
The Cupcake thing could be the 5th kid but that seems kinda weird, Chickas probably just controlled it (they might be trying to give the animatronics their own unique powers since Foxy is known for running and Freddy for involving no power).    More than likely the 5th kid is actually Marinate, or Mikes sister will become Marinate
I am sorry mat but I am gonna watch this one after the movie😂
Day 81 of asking film theorists to make a video about JackStauber.
if the robbery of the pizzeria comes at the beginning of the movie, I could see that as a reference to how the first Ghostbusters movie started with an unsuspecting victim stumbling upon a supernatural occurrence
I knew it was only a matter of time until this channel did a FNAF theory
Springtrap : I AM IN YOUR WALLS!
Dude! Style thoery is easy HOW TO MAKE A REAL SPRINGLOCK SUIT!
JESUS CAN I REST ALREADY??
so wait you stalked childrens instas📸😑
Im wantbto swe plants vs zombies timeline
When you realise that this is matpats last theory of freddy I'll miss you man 😢😢😢
I didn’t understand anything, but this was fun to watch
The Spring Bonnie suit is definitely part of a flashback of sorts, since in one of the trailers, we clearly see Springtrap, NOT Spring Bonnie
The fifth kid is obviously going to be the puppet. That's why he has the stripes on his shirt. He DOES have an indicator: he's the puppet.
so this whole video is pretty much surface level. nothing super out of the realm of what the trailers show.   somehow i expected more from "solved the movie". odd.
Homeboy it’s not even out yet😭✋
The *REAL* victim is MatPat having to solve the entire timeline Mat: "no.. no.. not another fnaf movie!" Fnaf Movie 2: *"I   A L W A Y S   C O M E   B A C K"* Mat: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
If Abbey get's eat by baby, because she thought the animatronics turned out to be good guys at the end, that would be awesome.
I won’t lie that kid that you think is the cupcake, I think might be the puppet, it doesn’t really make sense but the striped shirt makes most sense to me🤷🏼‍♂️
I feel sick but matpat's voice makes ne feel a bit better
It isnt even out yet 😭😭😭
Lol. I can't make heads or tails of FNAF anyway, mainly 'cause I've never played it. I do enjoy all the theorizing and such, though.
It's Shaggy 30 years later, he is now the monster.
I can’t be the only who doesn’t like Mat using “instagram” as evidence to confirm his theories
Me when Fnaf Movie releases: 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪⬜⬛🟪⬜⬛🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛🟪 🟪🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪
Its now even out yet, stop pls
baby’s first fnaf film theory lets goooo
I will tip every employee in the theater $1987 if that movie ends with the springlock scene.
Before watching this video I think that the fnaf movie is a movie about the horrible events like help wanted
But in the games elizabeth dies first and then the crying child.   Now i know this movie is in a different timeline than the games. But, what plot holes is it gonna fill if it changes the game timeline with a new timeline ?   My last question is this. If thats truly micheal afton, then how did he not recognize william aftons voice on the call ?   Im all ears. Please and thank you.🙂
Brand new movie posts one picture of their set  Matpat tells us the entire movie before its even realesed
Wait what about that one other female actor with the role of a main antagonist
I think that during the movie, the animatronics will act similar to how they do in the books. With it first appearing they're out to get Abby however it is later revealed that they're not they are acting similar to how they did with Jason in the silver eyes. As the movie goes on, Williams presence makes them go haywire. They end up sprinlocking him. Also could you do a video explaining how Godzilla fires his atomic breathe?
This is the most excited I’ve been for a movie in years! If Matpat doesn’t have some cameo as a detective or reporter, that would be a huge missed opportunity.
I actually was thinking the cupcake was possessed a while ago glad I’m not the only one
Can you do a theory about a YouTube series called Underverse? Please and thank you
Could it be the puppet? Because of the stripes
Matpat, you’re in the movie right? Right? In the end credits? Right?
Fun fact: October is the month of my birthday!
Is scott not gonna be a part of a sequel because i heard this is scotts last thing. or was it that this movie is fnafs last thing before it stops making new things
The kid who could be cupcake has a STRIPED SHIRT and BROWN PANTS. Familiar?
Scott-Cawthon-try-not-to-relate-every-fnaf-thing-back-to-silver-eyes-challenge  Level: IMPOSSIBLE
i actually immediately thought of the crying child when i saw that fifth child cause they both have striped shirts. i thought that’d be the defining feature 🤷
Would be entertaining if the films are like the books in that they aren't the same canon, but can fill holes in the games and books, while the books and games might fill some holes in the movie franchise.
WHY HAVEN’T YOU DONE ANYTHING ON THE NOW YOU SEE ME FRANCHISE?!?!? 🤨🃏
The movie isn't out yet bro Please CHILLL!!!
So in this movie they are making it so Mike and William aren’t related?
MATHEW ITS NOT OUT YET WHAT THE FRICK 😭😭😭😭
We now Golden Freddy in the games had two souls, culd maybe that hapend in the movie.
This confirms for me that they didn't cast Matt in the movie. Which is a shame. So now they know. Want to keep FNAF plot secret? Cast Matt.😂
Blud the movie hasent even come out yet 💀 💀 ☠️ ☠️
Fnaf into the Freddyverse.
When mikes brother is golden freddy then they can use the "it's me" line
FNAF: You can't beat me!  Game Theory: I know, but he can!  *Film Theory*
15:16  The child has a striped shirt. He's the Crying Child...?
The alternative is that Mike gets killed in the end and posseses golden freddy. Thats why Abby likes him and hes friendly.
Honestly I think Vanessa is lying. i dont think abby is their target they are kind to her because she is a kid like them idk i just dont trust friggin VANNY for anything
I really wonder why a certain american secret agency hasn't hired matpat
Okay but the animatronics for the movie look really huggable and I want to pat chica's head
Probably the good way to spoil a movie without others getting mad
i’m so happy josh and matthew are in it! josh plays a huge part of my childhood 🥹
15:13 the kid’s shirt does have stripes, maybe he’s the marionette?
Through the trailers. I found so many call back to the silver eyes trilogy like first of all golden Freddy is good others bad.
Matpat should be in the movie as some journalist whos upsets with the pizzaria
🍕🍕🍕
All you gotta do is "keep your eyes on the monitor little friends" Did he just do that unintentionally????
Imagine if the cookbook just solves all the lore and explains it in detail
the child that might be cupcake really seems to me like crying child
You or yall as in Game theory like a story writers best friend and biggest rival of story writers
i know you have a wife and kid but please marry me
I could not care less whatever happens in that movie but if the song "it's been so long" isn't in the movie I'm going to scream and yell and cry and poop my pants and poop other people's pants and yes
NEBRASKA NEBRASKA NEBRASKA got mentioned into a movie baby
Working at the theatre I get to see it early. I can try and confirm
Now I want to see a theory on the nutritional value of dead kids 😆
The cupcake is clearly Chica using Sheer Heart Attack!
15:38 fin.
No that 5th Kid was WEARING  A STRIPPED SHIRT for the Puppet. Marriott.  😫
another theory my friends and i thought of. what if the security job is really afton trying to lure mike and abby to the pizzaria. afton intends on kidnapping abby and turning her into an animatronic. golden freddy is indeed mikes brother who was kidnapped. and the plot twist is the animotronics are trying to befriend abby to SAVE her from becoming like them. it would explain why we never see mike actually get attacked and why we see vanny get attacked by springtrap, but suspiciously not killed
the 5th kid could be a movie exclusive animatronic. or the puppet because of the striped shirt
Har har har har har hhhhhar har har harhar, Five Nights at Feddys.
Day 4 of asking for a theory of my channel
If your not in this movie im rioting
I was 2 when it came out
I'm waiting for a bendy adaptation on the silver screen (be it a film or a television series).
We might see a spring lock seen
I dont know what to think about the movie. I think i would prefer if it just told the original story as it is in games rather than mix it all up and come up with some kind of recycled fnaf lore
What if garret goes missing through the  ball pit and then grow up to become Afton and as we see later abby will also discover that the ball pit time travels but somehow finds a way to come back. Although that will be a lot for new audiences.
I don’t think Abby just coincidentally dies at the end of the film, I think she’s specifically going to have to make some sort of deal with golden Freddy or the animatronics that she will join them in return for them saving Mike and Vanessa.
i was first introduced to fnaf via your theory video attempting to connect it to the real life chuck e. cheese murders. i was around nine then and im now turning 18 next month. these videos, your theories, and these games have been such an important part of my childhood and i will forever appreciate you and your team for contributing to this series.
13:58 This is the only EXTREMELY large sticking point for me. In the established lore the original possessed robots were explicitly aggressive to adults but nice to kids. This completely destroys that narrative and I don't like it...
Tbh idk abt Afton getting trapped into the walls, and because of the hype surrounding the springlocked thing happening so I think afton will prob get beaten up by the animatronics then somehow the spring lock happens and then he gets stuck in the walls
He's not here😢 He's not there 😢 He's not everywhere😢 Who you gonna call Not physic friend fredbear😢
I haven’t finished the whole video so I don’t know Matt Pat mention this, but if you look at their eyes, foxy has a eyes are more red
what are the chance of the extractor being mangle without the head shell
10 seconds in and, he should’ve said “It’s been so long”
its almost like game theory is handing down old toys to film
Dang, I was hoping to hear some hint of you having a cameo! Unless you were told to keep it secret until the movie comes out. If there is sequels depending on how the film does in the box office I hope you finally get your cameo!
JUST WAIT. FOR. ONE. MONTH.
It is so wild hearing MatPat explain a FNAF thing to an audience that isn’t saturated by the franchise. He stopped to clarify who Baby is!
Fun Fact WE ALL WAIT FOR IT!! a
Clearly we all forgot about the actor who was casted as: "unnamed villan"
Matpat said its been so many years he should be saying its been so long!! Since i last i see my son lost to his mon-
Steel Wool studios : Jimmy! Where's the script? Jimmy : Matpat took it.
Why is my guy sponsored by Google meet💀
When the movie drops I’ll be back to this vid … rooting for your theory MatPat!
if this theory ends up being true, then i was right matpat's been asking the creators to give him the plot
Most anticipated Film Theory episode ever.  Haven’t even watched and I know it’s gonna be a peak theory
We need to bring back tie-in games for movies so Matt has a chance to give share some film theories with Game Theory
honestly think that Markiplier can play the main character. it will be iconic.
14:00 Or maybe they're trying to protect her from William (just a thought)
Somehow I haven't heard anyone saying that Abby is such a odd name as for baby but dressed up after all. The afton family ends up by them turning into robots after all not so sure about aftons wife tho.
Im just going to say.... there is a bunch of strips on that last kids shirt....
It didn't even come out yet and you already solved it???!!?!!
YES
I feel like he actually nailed it😅😅
It comes out on my birthday!!
11:12 sponsor skip
Maybe the 5th kid can be the puppet?
I can disprove parts of the theory and prove that "Steve raglan" is actually William afton and also Mike's father, recently the person cast as unknown female villain has had a proper casting as Jane afton, the people then realised the mistake they made and corrected it to be more mysterious but the description of the movie as well as the changed casting accidentally proves that William is the father of Mike in this movie, the casting later is "Mike's aunt" meaning that Jane AFTON is Mike's aunt, meaning that Mike's dad is Jane AFTONS brother, meaning that they most likely share the same last name therefore Mike is an AFTON and and Mike's father is an AFTON so that means that according to the theory and description William afton kidnapped his own son? No that can't be right. I think that the movie is going to make it seem like he was kidnapped but it's going to twist and Mike will reveal he killed his brother in the jaws of Fredbear
He solved it t before it even came out
No, Matpat, don't use Anagrams of 4 letter names to make connections between characters, please. Even though it makes sense, we don't want a repeat of what happened last time a character with 4 letters, 2 of which are the same, for the love of everything sacred, please
Here's a film theory that is out there: this movie is just peetas brain trying to make sense of the things that happen to him in the capitol post catching fire and pre mockingjay part 1
Even though I never played the games, I'm watching this one on theaters.
I think there's a step missing here tbh Matt just like in the series we slowly find out more and more that the main animatronics aren't evil, with some exceptions like baby and springtrap post Williams death. I think that Vanessa like you said is a element meant to bridge the eras of fnaf but also is still somewhat a disciple of Afton leading it all the be one big misdirect to keep Mike and abby busy while Afton prepares. Steve Ragland could also be a robo duplicate, as if we don't have enough of those, of Afton similarly to Charly in the books
Matt has done so much for fnaf it's crazy
couldnt the boy in the stripes b idk..the puppet?
Matpat is basically a book of lore
Bro figured it out before it even came out
Here me out. If Afton put the dead children into the animatronics, and they start smelling and oozing body decomp, why didn’t the police check the animatronics? I mean the smell of decay is pretty distinct, so why didn’t the police get called by someone, anyone, who noticed the smell, let alone the decomp? This bugs me no end.
So we're just gonna ignore that last kid wearing a striped shirt just like the one The Crying Child wears?
Can’t wait for fnaf 2 and fnaf the movie the books to contradict this fnaf theory
I wonder how Afton stuffed a child inside of that cupcake.
The fifth kid is Mike's brother (golden Freddy) and that's why golden Freddy only appears with Abby.. because they're siblings
OH NO ITS GOTTEN TO THE OTHER CHANNELS
I have a theory that william left his family and got a new identity and then "mike's dad" comes in as a step father
5th kid is the puppet, puppet stripped shirt
The Abby name part 🫠🫠
What if the blonde kid is actually the marionette since little bro got a stripper shirt
Simple People were born in 2012
The fifth kid has a striped shirt so it could be puppet
Matpat, you underestimate me by believing there would be a happy ending
GOOGLE MEET? when Did they have a sponsor
Hey Matpat. I have a THEORY that the kid that you say is the cupcake is actually the puppet (because of the striped shirt)
Only mat pat can solve a movies lore before it releases
I love how Matt has to pretend to not be reading the script written by google for the Meet promo; there is no way that Matt himself would choose to highlight features like "You can share your screen" or "You can add as many people as you want" to an audience which is primarily students or people in their early-20s. We just had a pandemic, TRUST ME, we know what google meet can do.
what i think is the reason it says steve raglan is william changed his identity to distance himself from the murders.
Mattpat please make a video on adventure time 🙏💯
my bday's april 7
How did I not know FNAF takes place in Utah, the state of my hometown?!?!?
The “cupcake” kid is probably the puppet because of the long sleeves and striped outfit
my family is gonna go to the movie along with me i cannot wait
God I love the movie logo
0:53-Maybe you could explore if the springlock animatronic/suit could be used in real life
I really want to like this movie, but I just cant see myself enjoying it with its PG13 rating and the animatronics incredibly unscary nature... I mean that cupcake attack was just... come on man.
I love the idea of some innocent film theory viewer who doesn’t like video games and has never seen game theory looking at these comments and just seeing the absolute pandemonium this series has caused on GT
I wish there WILL be springlocking scene
"lets hope she doesnt Time travel" As a fazbear frights fan thank you matpat
Bro got cracked up
BTW the movie I not Canon
I feel like instead of the child being the cupcake I feel like it would make more sense to be the puppet you can even notice the line pattern on his shirt but I may be wrong about that because the original puppet was a girl
So android IS better than iPhone?... Yes!
I am Chicken
Wait is this film theory or game theory?
after all these years fnaf is finally on film theory
This is a good theory Matpat
Har har har har har har har 🐻🐻🐻🐻🧸🐻🐻
Bro the movie isn't even out yet
I tought you're  gonna make a theory after  the movie releases
Who’s gonna tell matpat about cloak’s fnaf line
Still waiting for the film theory on the gran turismo movie…
You made a theory about the FNAF movie so early?
no but why is mike haunted by the *unsolved dissapearence* of his brother?
I am really excited for the scene where springtrap appears I'm just gonna scream *i always come back*
Making this comment to force myself not to watch this until after the movie bc spoilers 😭
the alter simmons
I love that mat pat saw the list of the kids but said there's nothing that links him to any characters from the games but look at his shirt it's dark and striped maybe he is Mike's brother not the cup cake but golden freddy that's why he doesn't seem hostile to her
i just assumed the machine was the scooper from sl
Matpat i never got into that game series only known it thru watching your videos .... so it not something i really got into or found my cup of tea as i dont like that style of gaming much.. sure i like the vibe a bit and known it to remind me a little like Chuck E Cheese as a kid but nothing beyond that point has got me into it :p
I suspect the plotwist will be that Vanessa is working with W. Afton. She's literally telling Mike "they want to make her like them" to persuade him in order to help them and at end the plotwist will revealed as Vanessa betrays Mike and Abby. It's my own interpretation of the story. I hope I'll partially right.
Th reason he baring Abby is because the babysitter was bad. You can tell because there was a leaked scene
I am so exited!!!
You can always count on a film trailer to show and spoil the entire lore and plot before the full film is even released.
what if puppet ? cuz shirt
Another victim? Oh Mat, your suffering gives us Joy.
Matt! you do realize what the 5th child was wearing, right? striped shirt, blue pants; its the crying child!
finnaly our waking slumber is over
Could mike be a parallel with charlie.  He could be a robot and his brother is could not really exist since mike was the one taken instead. Just a thought let me know what you think
I think the 5th kid is the crying Child or the Golden Freddy
Matpat!!! The kid has a striped shirt he is not the cupcake he is the puppet!
W Cory
Guinevere Beck
Just when I though this franchise couldn't scare me anymore... Of course they have to make to make a movie where everything seems so realistic it makes me scared again!!! 😭
Wow you did great with this theory, Let's find the truth soon!
Very Epic Video Matpat, and I Can't Wait to Watch the FNAF Movie!  (;
IM HYPED!
The first 20 seconds of the video made me want Matt Pat to create his own horror movie so bad. 😂😂😂 We need this.
I want a matpat detective bonus scene in the credits like a marvel movie where he just says "I have a theory"
all i want matthew lillard character to said is i wouldv'e gotten away with it if it werent for you medding kids. just put a scooby doo easter egg.
The 5th kid has stripes like the marionette, case closed.
2:35 left of the saw machine, the object has the shape of an animatronic mask, doesn’t it?
Is this looking my fnaf is doing this on purpose. Stop helping matpat drag this along
I like to believe that matpat has four siblings that look exactly like him for each channel
Couldnt the one kid be crying child since his striped shirt is kinda like the crying childs shirt
I’m very excited about Matthew lilard
So basically it's just Silver Eyes
I wanna believe that the writters of the movie watched game theory videos.
Never thought I’d see the day FNAF would appear on Film Theory
Lets be honest. We all agree that the ending will be the Springlock Failure.
18:00 I think William will dismantle the animatronics and the souls will try to get him and he will be springlocked
I would think the kid with the stripped shirt would be the puppet
Movie haven’t even come out yet what?
I assume the puppet wasn't in the trailer because that one kid very clearly had a striped shirt. That cupcake is a leap of the puppet is an option.
Bro the movie isn't even out
Not matpat spoiling the whole movie before it comes out
i just assumed it was that scooper thing lol
I have nown about fnaf 4-5 years but i got intresded 1 year ago
fnaf theory crossover week food with like the cook book film with the movie  style with like something about the suits then game theory with like a prediction on help wanted two
watch this delay the movie-
I have to wonder where the puppet fits into all this, and whether we see in in the movie, I mean, it is a big part of the lore after all, seems strange to leave it out
bro solved the movie before it even came out😭😭🙏
JAMES
I lived in nebraska for 12 years
This is one video im passing on in case it is right. Will come back after the movie and see of its correct.
"Golden Freddy!" "Shut up, Baby. I know it!"
p e e t a            im sorry, i watched the hunger games for a class project, and i saw josh hutcherson's image and my first thought was "is that peeta?"
Does Google meet work on my Apple Watch? Or my Samsung Fridge?
Ok, so that machine you keep having problems with could just be the inner mechanisms that connect the outer suit of the animatronic. One of the main things they talked about in the original game was how you’d basically die of being stuffed inside the animatronic. Does this 100% line-up with what’s in the games? I don’t know, but that’s what it seemed like to me the first time I ever saw it. I could be wrong, but hearing you say it’s a remnant extractor or something so many times made me want to throw my hat into the ring haha. Cheers Matt keep up the good work 👍
Online classes
Nebraska born and raised 🤚 Omaha ❤😂🎉
Do a home - animation cartoon about tanks episode
Dude… THE MOVIE HASNT EVEN COME OUT YET😭
my brain saw a kid in a striped shirt and went "the puppet" and I-
If William Afton becomes springtrap I’ll die in peace
I started watching this vid 2 minutes after it was posted but had to go because I had school 🥲 also Matpat how are you able to bring all these mentions together I’ve been puzzled on the movies lore since the trailers dropped 😭😭😭
Thanks for ruining another movie plot matpat love ya work mate
Mike has a sister, and a missing brother he wants to protect that is gone... Mike Afton has a sister and a brother he wants to protect that is gone. Also maybe Mike(movie) brother posses Goldem freddy like Mike aftons bother, and mike(movie) which might be why golden Freddy is friendly in this movie because it's his sister that he is friendly to
A happy ending with everyone smiling it’s fnaf of course it wouldn’t have that. Also, it’s interesting that William is not Mike’s father here.
Hey theorist gang!   I know you guys love YouTube lore, so I wanted to bring this up. There's a channel called 'Starkid', they're best known for the Harry Potter musicals.  They've been releasing a series of horror-comedy musicals, and they are dripping with lore (in some cases literally). It's unfinished as of now, but fhe next installment (Nerdy Prudes Must Die) is coming out soon, which means now would be a great time for some theories.
*the movie creators changing the whole movie so matpat is correct*
I think for the final of the movie there's going to be a final battle Mikes gonna have to fight springtrap And the pizzeria is gonna to burn down
Watch blumhouse watching this and they be like: DANG HE GOT IT, LETS REMAKE IT AND ADD ANOTHTER 2 YEARS OF WATI TIME
If the kid is possessing the cupcake how did the kids body fit in the cupcake
The cupcake is the dog 🤨
May be the fifth child is the puppet animatronic or the crying child
What abt the ending tho? Cuz remember abby gets in a cab with freddie
Bro. the kid who is wearing a brown shirt is obviously freddy. the kid wearing idk gold and a top hat? its golden freddy.
I think it's more likely that Abby becomes baby and THEN stops springtrap from killing vannessa and mike
THE BONNY KID IN THE TRAILER IS CRYING CHILD
ITS NOT EVEN OUT BROOO
bro got sponsored by google
I think MatPat put way more thought into this than a single person working on the movie. That is both a compliment to him, and an insult to the creators.
The fifth kid has a stripped shirt, very reminiscent of the puppet. Could be a stand-in for charlie, unless she and henry exist in this universe. If William Afton exists in this universe, then henry could too.
I thought the fifth kid was the puppet.
The Springbonnie suit doesn’t look decay because it was William Afton inside the suit that hasn’t got springlock failure yet
The kid who you said was cupcake has the same outfit as crying child just letting you know
that 5th kid in the field looks like the crying child
MatPat sees a kid wearing a striped shirt that could represent the Crying Child or The Puppet and instantly says it's The Cupcake.
I don't know what's more sad, the fact that matpat thinks he's going to solve is the FNAF franchise with this one video or that I understood exactly what he was saying when he said Agony extractor.
Ok so hear me out on this matpat says that the robot that looks like it's about the sawed-off Mike's face doesn't look or sound like anything that is described in any of FNAF but is it just me or does it kind of sounds similar to what baby was going to do to Carlton in the fourth closet
Megamind was wrongfully incarcerated
We need Matpat in fnaf 2
Mathew Lillard looks like peepaw matpat 😭
I never though I would see a sponsor of Google
I know what you mean but how tf can William put a kid in a Cupcake animatronic? 😂😂😂
I believed that Vanessa was either lying or misinformed when she stated the goal of the animatronics, with their real goal being to protect Abby... by killing anyone who gets close. Apart for the direct changes and questions extending from that difference in interpretation, I agree with what was presented. But you have provided some good evidence. I am now no longer as confident in my original vue.
I use google meet to talk to my friend
They are making a fnaf movie novel can’t wait to read it
7:09 : even in the casting his role doesn’t have a name!
What if that 1 kid is supposed to be William ?
As per usual, I think Matt’s theory version of the movie is the pest possible version and I will be disappointed if the real thing is inferior. Hollywood- hire Matt to review your scripts already!
It's funny to think that without matpat we wouldn't have any of this there would be no movie or other games and without matpat no one would know about the gory story with the dead kids
If you look closely the 5th kid is dressed just like the crying child well kinda stripe shirt and blue pants
Afton not looking and sounding like he does in the games really gets my ocd. 😂
Mat it hasn’t even came out yet
fivre video please notoice me 🧑‍🚒
this theory is not it 💀
IT WASENT EVEN RELIAZED
Before I watch this, imagine if this is Aftons whole plan. He had finally found a way to glitch into real life and make a movie about it. Lol
Great, now we're gonna have a 90+ video playlist  by next year on new film theories about FNAF. Haven't seen the vid yet, I just wanted to comment this.
wait mat pat maybe the 5th child in mike's dream could be Charlie/the puppet because of the striped shirt, I don't know just a theory
here before 100 million views, currently its 900k
wait a minute…MIKE IS WILLIAMS SON, SO WHY WOULD WILLIAM KIDNAPP MIKES BROTHER!?
After 8 years I feel like this movie is gonna be disappointing af Sadly Scott, Blumehouse don't give af and just want a quick cash grab
Matpat could be in the fnaf movie as a theoriest
5 days after my birthday! Let's go man, can't wait to see it after
bro solved it & it’s not even out yet😂
IM GOING TO CINEMAS FOR FNAF MOVIE!
It is worth noting the 5th kid's shirt is 2 tone brown stripes that are remarkably similar to the cupcake wrapper and the blonde hair is pretty close to the candle flame (flame being a bit darker of course). In fairness it could be the color grading on my tablet that makes them look similar.. And t play devil's advocate if he is the cupcake I would imagine that there is some relationship between him and the chika girl that would explain them staying close together even as souls.
and we go again
It hit me different when I looked up film theory for a fnaf video.
ngl i also realized i think they made thier eyes glow yellow in the movie to refrence the end of night five on fnaf 3 bad ending
Nevertheless, we have about a month to go. Not that long. And, boy, I haven't been this excited for a film since Jurassic World!! 😁
I might be with matpat on the cupcake thing, in the poster for the movie the cupcakes eyes are glowing red just like the rest of the characters.
at some point Abby will become baby in the movie, then both mike's brothers will die, and springtrap will born... idk
He made this 7hours ago
Matpats comment about the Venassa Character having watched his video actually did spark the idea in me that it is really possible that the actress likly did. there is a solid chance that mutiple actors of this show got into this franchise from Matpats videos.  Thats how long he's been at this.
2:37 probably the scooping room
Google Meet does not have "INCREDIBLE QUALITY"
I can’t believe Matpat made a theory on the movie a month before it releases
Dude that's golden freddy 13:45
Finally, we got film theory channels are united
My theory is that the second movie's villan will be springstrap and in third movie we go to circus baby's rental years after abby died than the protagonist of the third movie gets ennered
Oh no, the fnaf is spreading to more channels-
been following matpat and fnaf since the first ever fnaf video, and i gotta say, this series evolved A LOT xd coming to the point where they can even release a movie, following all this progress makes me so happy ^^
I think the fifth kid might be the marionette
fnaf being on film theory is so funny to me
2:40 When i saw that saw like mask my first idea was this is clearly a nightmare a character is having... did noone else thought the same thing?
Its crazy to see fnaf on film theory
I cant believe Shaggy is the purple guy
I like the agony extractor theory but. What if it's the unwound springlocks, it looks like it's inside a Freddy mask, so maybe?
Oh my God, the fact that Matthew Lillard is in this movie literally the same dude that played shaggy makes me so happy for some reason
Woah
If you follow that all the kids are wearing something that links them to who they are possessing then the fact the kid is wearing a brown striped shirt could be symbolic of the cupcake wrapper.
Omg i need the movie to end with williams death in the springlock suit like fnaf 2
So now Fnaf is spreading everywhere on matpat channels.
Film theory has some of my absolute favorite theories and least favorite but it's still my favorite Green is my favorite color and like I like all the game theories but I don't know something about film theory ir just is awesome probably cuz I want to maybe animate in the future I don't know but yeah film theory is my favorite so support the middle child I'm not a middle child but I love this
Maybe you should have had a book theory considering how many times you've used  books for your theories
My theory on the remnent is that it is a Freddy mask
The movie hasn't even been released yet and Matt has already solved it
I wish they had made it into a real horror movie.
Bro, you forgot that the fifth kid has a striped shirt....Hmmm Crying Child???
Never thought id see fnaf in film theory
Bro chill out the movie isn't even out yet and you probably already have the exact plot and every detail in the movie
Appreciate the YouTube hustle, but Imma wait until the movie comes out and I watch it before watching this
How do you sponsor only a part of a YouTube video
Striped shirt on the 5th kid
this is the one horror movie i actually hope to see and im not even a huge fan of fnaf
The cupcake spirit looks like the crying child I mean he has the same striped shirt like cmon
it should be mentioned that the cupcake moving on his own has been an established thing well before the movie
what if it's cassidy 15:26  ?
this is my theory, the reason why the animatronics want Abby to become like them is because they want Abby to become a leader, which will make Abby become the puppet for the next movie.
how tf do u get google meet to sponser u?
Nah, i bet you afton captures mike and turns him into golden freddy
Maybe the ,5th kid is the puppet
I wonder, if abby does becomes baby and afton isnt her father in this version, what would he character be based around? With her being all about william in the games itd be wierd having to change her drive completely
My birthday is october 26
The ad was miss leading, i asked my class mates if they wanted to study on google meet. They called me broke for having a android and studied without me on FaceTime.😢
I actually used it at my online school
2:52  REMNANT
The kid is wearing crying child's shirt, surprised Matt didn't notice.
Bro how the movie didn’t even come out😭
If your idea about it being a flash back for mikes dad then it might be showing mikes dads death and him getting adopted by William however it doesn't make sense about mikes brother getting kidnapped because why would william kidnap his own son?
I gotta admit, I thought that the reason that we haven’t had a theory up till now was because Matpat was in the movie as a cameo and got some sort of insider info.
my friends and I have been planning on going on opening day for months. we're gonna take up like a row and a half
It's not out yet, silly Matpat.
What if the 5th kid is the marionette the puppet from fnaf 2?
"Thanks to Google Meet for sponsoring a portion of today's video."  -Anybody else feel as soon as they heard that like it should have been on The Food Theorists this week instead?
13:40 I'm glad Mat said that because I got a theory, if Abby goes in the ball pit and time travels back before the kids were killed she probably became friends with the 5 other kids and that's why the animatronics are not attacking her because they know her as a good friend.
2:35 honestly Matt that kinda looks like the scoop from five nights at Freddy’s sister location, that might be what that is, but again I may be completely wrong, unless that’s an actual animatronic, but it doesn’t look like it  oh…never mind as it turns out it is an animatronic. I was just looking at it from a different angle. whoops😅
One thing you didn’t touch on here was that their was a casting for a “female villain” which is also not the actress that plays Vanessa. Maybe this could be the voice/person in the Baby suit?
har har harhar har 🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣🥶🥶🥶
Couldnt the cupcake be Susie's dog?
Matpat at his fnaf insanity again
fnaf vs willy wonderland ?
BRO just tried to solve the fnaf movie even if it didn't release
GOLDEN FREDDY NOT GOLDEN FREDBEAR MATPAT
Saying this before i watch the video. The only time i want you to be wrong is now, only because i want to be completely shocked by fnaf
I would love if Nicholas Cage cameos. Not because I want a shared universe, but because it would be a fun cameo. I won't lie, part of me just wants to watch Nicholas Cage fight Matthew Lillard with a mop.
Day 1 of me asking matpatt to watch a series of unfortunate events and find out who started the Baudelaire fire
I expected a lot more lunacies from this
5th kid has a striped shirt…..
my man knows the meaning of life
the twin-golden freddy theory is really cool and i haven't thought of that. I think it especially works with how golden freddy is presented with a missing eye and ear, representing hes 'missing his other half' aka his twin. which is kinda really sad when you think about it :(
Its funny how i said i. Want to watch fnaf before matpat makes a theory  on it and behold i found out it was released  already 😆
Haha! I liked AND subscribed!!!
You were sponsored by Google? How did that happen?
Could that kid be the puppet? He was wearing stripes after all? 😅just a theory, no proof...
Matpat, it's a kid wearing a striped shirt. It's the puppet bro
Yay finally a new ep!!!!
Rare MatPat W. He uses Android.
so is each channel a different personality that specializes in different media? (like a split personality kind of thing)
Realizing the animatronics are in a ball pit Remaind me of the books
The movie didn't even released yet🤣
Has it seriously been a decade????? Jesus
Naw man image getting brutally murdered and while all your friends become 7 foot tall killing machines you become a frigging cupcake 💀
garrett being mike's brother kinda fits pre perfectly if the only scenes he's in so far is with abby and he's not attacking her
can't wait for matpat to be completely wrong about FNAF lore again
Here we go again
the fifth kid is wearing stripes. STRIPES. STRIPES, MATPAT, STRIPES.
Just calling it now... SOMEHOW this movie will be canon to the games. Maybe
It's honestly kinda weird to have this video on in the back and then just hear mat pat say my name
Remember when William Dafoe was casted as William Afton 😂
Bros gonna get the last 40 episode just out the movie
If the ending is the spring lock scene that would be so sick
You should watch Junji Ito we need a Junji Ito Theory
I like the idea that five nights at Freddy’s has devolved into solely making matpats life as confusing and miserable as possible
Yooo i can’t wait for this movie, and the sequels, hope we see the nightmares at some point,
Go big 🔴
Are you gonna be in it?
Nice vid.
Remember, Scott said he would only develop movies on the first 3 games, like it or hate it
Don’t make theories till after the you watch the fnaf movie
I was never a FNAF kid and now I deeply regret it. I was like 8 or 9 when everyone started to do the FNAF videos on YouTube and to be honest, I was just wayyyyy to scared to play the game. Everyone always said it was a horrifying game and that you’d get nightmares from it. I never wanted to take that chance so for a very long time, I just turned away from any mention of the game. Even now I still don’t like it very much, but I still can’t wait to see the movie for some reason.
You can trust matpat and his team to spoil the movie a month before it comes out
1 day I would totally see matpat Break into Freddy fazbear's pizzeria and look for clues 😂
Are we not considering the extra child to be the marionette…because of his striped shirt?
I don't know how to feel about the fact that there are 60 fnaf game theory videos.  And I definitely don't know how to feel about the fact that I've seen every single one of them more than once.
Mat pat I may be a little off but, What if the kid you identified as the cupcake was the puppet because the striped shirt?
Someone who said that Matt needs to do a fnaf film theory was absolutely correct and this was amazing👍
To watch this franchise turn from a little indie franchise into this family and people coming together to make costumes and short films, and to actually see the evolution of the actual movie…. It’s been a blessing. sad to see Scott retire but it was, is, and will continue to be amazing.
yaknow with any other channel i'd cry "INSANE"...but with this guy in particular, it's plenty normal
matpat, i love ya, but have we learned nothing from trying to predict fnaf? scotts probably laughing as he chanfes the script rn
It’s so funny that this franchise takes place in the Mormon state😂
Bro ITS NOT EVEN RELEASED YET!!!!!
3:28 also from that one snipit i can tell you for absolute certainty this game takes place in 1999, if it takes place in the 90s.  That accord specifically is the 6th generation accord which was introduced in late 1998 as a 1999 model the the new year has clearly passed (thanks to the slush on the ground) so that means this movie must take place no sooner than February 1999.
Mike:  I've caught you, and I've already made the call! Matthew Lillard:  You called the cops?  My mom and dad are gonna be SO mad at me!
The movie comes out on my bday 🎉
troll face anniversary and matpat fnaf movie video.... what a strange birthday
Matpat is the type of guy to get Google meet to sponsor his channel 😂
Istg if "Bad Cupcake" is a hint towards the poor fifth kid being stuck in the cupcake I will LOSE it
I’d love to see in the movie like a post credit scene or something Markiplier as a cop running in and saying what do you think happened here just for MatPat to come on scene and say I have a Theory
I think the most unrealistic part of the Fnaf movie is it not being released several months early
I think you mixed up the last two kids. The brown shirt kid is Freddy and the one with a yellow shirt and top had is golden Freddy. Think about it. He’s wearing a yellow shirt and a top hat.
i like how he solved a movie that hasn't even been released yet
your the only person i can trust to tell this too so my mom is dating a abusive bf who abbusies me and just slapped me and yells at me and is going to get us kicked out of our apartment i dont know what to do
What kind of criminal robs an old arcade of its quarters and smashes the pinball machines? Those things are worth more than anything else in there, and probably weigh about as much as a bucket that big of arcade tokens
I think if we get the “animatronics gang up on Afton” event, it’d be perfect to have Afton turn into Sprintrap with *that* scene
Least insane Matpat fnaf theory
This was a fine analysis, but oof. Thick bus tire treads all over that poor child actor's backside... Hope the kid doesn't get any negative repercussions for a few unthoughtful social media posts.
its fnaf, no way it has a happy ending
Its funny how MatPat basically explained the end of silver eyes at the end
Bro spoiled movie
I thought the 5th kid kinda looked like the crying child because of the type of shirt he wears. It looks like crying childs.
This is the first (and last) Matpat theory that I am NOT going to watch because I'm really hyped for the FNaF movie. But I'm sure everyone else who decides to watch will tell me that it's a great video as usual.
yo
Isn't the whole point of golden freddy that they have two souls in it? Maybe it's that one kid and Michael's brother? Idk lol
That children play this game is deeply unsettling. 😵‍💫 Yeesh.
I assumed the kid wearing the brown t shirt was Freddy and the kid with the top hat would be golden Freddy. But you do you Mat.
I thot the last kid was Freddy, and the one before that was golden Freddy(yellow shirt and brown shirt). But cupcake is also a good idea that I questioned earlier 5his day funnily enough.
How many times will matpat say he solved it😂
The fifth kid has a striped shirt like other characters in the franchise. I think the fifth kid is The Puppet.
Or, you know, Matthew Lilard could actually be the fifth child and Afton somehow infected him with his ideology, carrying on William's plan much like Jigsaw's acolytes in the Saw franchise. Setting up for the reveal that Afton HAS been dead for years, but the spirits inside the animatronics becoming activated roused his spirit, as well.  Which would still leave your Golden Freddy theory untouched, while also giving us a twist that spreads the theory that Afton is trying to "franchise" the concept of life after death through the collection of Remnant.  Just a thought, really.
im legit in a google meet while watching this
Hmm... do you think that there's a chance that the box from FNAF 4 might be a plot point?
This is a far fetched theory but what if mike is spring Bonnie? We never exactly see him being chase by spring Bonnie as it’s perceived. Maybe whenever he’s yelling it could just be the spirits chasing him and eventually trapping him into the that machine. (Although we know that is a Freddy suit)
I thought the 5ths kid outfit looks like the crying child’s outfit
CALM DOWN ON THE SPEEDRUNNING! IT ISNT EVEN OUT YET MY GUY!
But isn't the kid with the top hat wearing yellow too? So wouldn't he be golden Freddy and then the kid that is unidentified is wearing a brown-ish shirt
You say cupcake, I say "Hes got horizontal stripes on his shirt, its gotta be the crying child."
I don’t know what surprises me more, the fact he solved the lore before the movie is even out or the Fact that FNAF theories are now officially on TWO GT channels
I do kinda hope that there is a spring lock scene in the movie
This is getting me super excited to see the FNAF movie, and I can't wait for OCt27th
Someone mentioning that Mike's "dad" is actually his stepdad, therefore I have a theory who's gonna play the young William Afton in the flashback. It's gonna be Markiplier!
13:29 it looks like the animatronics are like " dude, why did you spoil it for him"
Btw just to help your theory on the mirror in the office it says “it’s me”
the 5th boys shirt looks like a cup cake wrapper
My only question about the Cupcake theory (albeit a dark/creepy one), is how did William put the kids body in the Cupcake? Just a thing to think about.
MatPat having to keep track of multiple FNAF timelines is crazy. 😭
If you give matpat a inch he will take a mile
I kinda hope that Mat pat is in the movie and this video is just to keep his audience less suspicious.
K hear me out the fith kid COULD be golden freddy still because his shirt is striped like the crying child
Btw i never watched five nights at freddys but I've heard about and seen it on YouTube just never clicked any videos. No secret just thought it was for children lol
FNAF making it to Film Theory. We did it boys!
I HAVE WAITED FOR THIS FOR SO LONG 😭
Bro the movie hasn't even come out yet chill 😭
The shirt is the cupcake
Geez you guys got a whole 100k views in the hour i spent watching this
The kid has a stripped shirt…maybe puppet
Ok here me out what if they moved to u-Haul
Two things. Watch when we go to the movies and we watch the movie and matpat calls out Literally every single part of the movie out in this video. And then another thing, I think at the end of the movie that Michael, Vanessa, and Abby are going to go to a circus and we think this is the end then going to the circus and having fun. But Abby wanders off and find circus baby and she gets snatched up and we have a cliffhanger and then the second movie is based off sister location like OMG 😱
My guess is the movie takes place in 1993 since fnaf 3 takes place in 2023 thats 30 years and a good chunk of time for springboi to decay, and if Willard is getting a 3 picture deal im guessing its this movie, a fnaf 3 movie (since a fnaf 2 wouldn't make sense since bb is drawn on the walls), and maybe a fnaf 6 movie. Just a thought but they could always have his 2nd/3rd deal be a random point in the second movie.  or have it be known theres 3 movies then make another like the games, but who knows
fnaf
matpat always having the weirdest sponsors lol
at freddys
when does the video start
he did the same thing with sister location
15:20 that kid in lead is definitely the marionet since the stripe and thing. Plus marionett is the one bringing those child to live in those animatronic
Imagine they have to push the movie into the future due to mat literally guessing the plot
abby becoming baby would also make sense bc elizabeth was also baby
ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET!
Day 12 of asking matpat to do a film theory on marble hornets
We need a food theory on that cupcake 😂
fnaf at freddy
As a Nebraska resident, I’d be really happy if the movie ended up being set in my state, that would be insane and would give me the ultimate excuse to finally make a purple guy costume for Halloween!!
five nights
How you solve something that’s not even out yet
fnaf
****HEAVY CONFIRMED SPOILERS****                         Yeah, the offical cast page lists Lillard as William Afton.
one thing i see plausible is that the "golden freddy" might be mike schmitt. if you pause at 14:32 we get a good look at the mask. its got scratches, a big hole on the bottom left, a yellowish tint.  it looks like this thing was made to eradicate a persons head, to be then put into the animatronic as an endo.   im calling that either abby or vanessa was strapped in there or held hostage and to save her mike offers himself to be put in there, hence the scene where mike is similarly strapped but just closes his eyes as if content what is about to happen.
there is a fnaf movie
Could the fifth child be the puppet?
I personally think that they should give dadpat a thick broom, or walrus, style mustache. He looks too much like matpat I almost got confused
Imagine having a proper timeline for this story 😂
My brother in Christ the movie isn’t even out yet
WERE GONNA GET THE SPRINGLOCK FAILURE!!!!!!
I wonder if the last child could be the puppet
Hey, this is the closest we've ever had to Crying Child having a canon name
holy sheet he did it
ageee i juss saw my boy corey🫡💞
You know you've hit it big when google meet sponsors you
Cap
DO A THEORY ON ADVUTURE TIME I WILL ASK UNTIL YOU DOO IT OH YEEAH THISS IS DAYY 1 PLSS MAKE A FILM THEROYRY VIDEO ON ADVUTURE TIME
My theory is that  Afton isn’t in this movie at all.
I have always had this theory, so I’ll share it here since the cupcake is brought up.  I think the cupcake is Susie’s dog.  Hear me out. Chica’s the only character that has a smaller animatronic with them, and Susie is the only one we know the way Afton lured her to her death, claiming her dog is still alive, and is with him.  A lot of people think the dog is Mangle, as it acts a lot more animalistic. However, the animatronic has literally been ripped apart constantly, and is build like an animal, so it physically can’t attack like person, or like the other animatronics.  As for the movie, the cupcake literally jumps on the dudes face. It acts a lot like a guard dog. Unable to protect her when they were alive, but still trying to protect her now as animatronics.  I personally believe this theory. It’s so small, it probably doesn’t impact the lore much, if at all, but it makes a lot of sense, and helps draw similarities from Susie to Chica.  Chica and her cupcake - Susie and her dog, it lines up really well. Thought it’d bring it up here.
You know it's going to be a good Film Theory video when the first 1/3 is just explaining the concept of "Adaptation".
See android is the write choice   most of team theorists have them
Do you know they actually did mention that they were going to have a sequel and a prequel for the movie maybe film theories right maybe Willam Afton 18:06 , and will die at the end of the movie or it will happen in the next movie maybe
The fifth kid can also be the puppet he’s wearing a stripe shirt
Cool❤❤
Amazing video, also Google meet sponsor?
Matpat: keep your eyes close to your monitors theorists  Also matpat: flash bangs everyone 3 seconds later  😂😂
Mike is going to be golden Freddy not Abby you even showed a piece of the trailer where Mike is getting a golden Freddy head getting chainsaw to his face. does that give you more Loor  in that FNAF book? I have seen every FNAF video. I've been doing FNAF homework. DO YOUR HOMEWORK FOR FNAF LOOR
Stripes on kid 5's shirt make me think of the puppet
MAT THERE IS PRETTY MUCH LESS THAN A MONTH LEFT YOU CAN REST!!!!!!!!!!!
Cool
lets pray the film does well, so yeah.
we just need an entire channel for fnaf  fnaf theory channel when?
Loving the time travel ball pit mat Pat, you really know how to throw in a good reference
I don’t understand the confusion of Matthew Lillard playing William. That’s confirmed.
Fifth kid is wearing a striped shirt. Could be a puppet reference
Mat we need a FNAF week on all four channels this October
I hope this movie answers some questions, bc I feel like nothing has been absolutely answered by the games
Here we go again 😭fnaf has made it onto FILM THEORY
NOBODY IS SAFE FROM THE HAUNTED ANIMATRONICS...
I don't think afton is in the suit at the beginning I think he doesn't get in the suit until the end.
thanks to google WHAT?????
Then: the film isd about the past before fnaf1
we should have MatPat prediction bingo cards so we can mark down which ones he gets right
I still can't get over how amazing the animatronics costumes look.
Day shifts at Freddy's vibes
Hhhhhjjjjjhh
Video sixty six of begging matpat to make a theory either about something finnish or using finnish statistics (or the evillious chronicles :3)
I'm just scared the pg 13 rating is going to down play it in a goofy way I hope not
ATTENTION: EVERYONE THAT DOESNT KNOW FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY’S DONT WATCH THIS THEORY! TAKE THE BLUE PILL AND RUN! GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN!
I find it kind of funny I have followed every video mat has done on this like this as well and I have never played the games never intend to play the games and absolutely not going to watch the movie. I am not good with horror.
That commercial for Google was soooooooooooo long
why do I feel like if they make a sequel it would have the nightmare animatronics
10:55 but can it run doom?
Nice guess, but I disagree. I think that the twist will be that Mike Schmidt will become Golden Freddy. You never see Mike and Golden Freddy standing next to each other and you see Golden Freddy standing next to Abby who is his sister. Just a thought.
The FNAF movie will be nothing without the…**shutters**…fan….
Commenting for the algorithm...!
The way that chica freezes when the cupcake attacks the guy that’s breaking in makes me think that the soul can transfer in and out of both of the animatronics
Bro imagine you get horrifically killed and your soul is forced to wander the earth maliciously searching for your killer and you're trapped in a cupcake robot
The fnaf movie releases on my literal 25th birthday! My girlfriend’s not excited at the thought of that being my birthday outing. But this series has given me and her young sibling a bridge to bond. So regardless of the quality it’s gonna be a memorable birthday
I’m so excited for the fnaf movie also, IM FINALLY EARLY FOR ONCE
Maybe the 5th kid is the puppet, he is wearing a striped shirt afterall...
Mat, you don't have to put all that work into proving Matthew Lillard is playing William Afton, that was one of the first things we were told about the casting
Game Theory : discussing the FNAF games  Film Theory : discussing the FNAF movie(s)  Food Theory : discussing the FNAF Cookbook  Style Theory : maybe discussing the effectiveness of the Glitchtrap outfit IRL.
Yeah  even if it's coming out on my birthday
thought the kid with a stripe shirt would be closer the puppet more then anything
The power MatPat has to be sponsored by GOOGLE MEET is insane. I like to imagine he had the biggest face of shock💀
I’ve been waiting 8 years for this moment!!! Fnaf on film theory let’s goooooooooo!!!
I think I am the only person that has noticed that the right arm and right side of the face of Afton's suit are decayed
Mat I like your cupcake theory but at the same time we see him wearing a stripe shirt just like the crying child, obviously his hair is blond and the crying kids hair is brown but not everything in this movie is the same as the games. He is also standing in front of everyone showing he’s the leader just like how the puppet helped the other kids, and is know to be the leader.
matpat really solved the fnaf movie before it was released
0:41 it’s out already ive think I sawn in a store
Hi matpat I was wondering if you could do a film theory on super why 😅
I hope the movie follows the games foot steps and keeps the lore cryptic and goes easy easy on the exposition
Matt, Pat, do you actually make these theories?
The vanessa line about the animatronics wanting to make abby one of them could also be a throw off for the general audience; vanessa being wrong. Unless they are throwing away the whole thing about the classic crew being okay with kids but not adults
I just want someone’s face getting bitten off as a scene. It better happen
Mat could probably figure out the future lore of humanity
IM SUCH A FNAF FAN(it randomly took over my TikTok and I got invested so I played the first game up to night 2 and then quit bc it was hard and I’m a wimp) ❤❤
5TH KID IN A STRIPED SHIRT NOT THE PUPET ?????
The cupcake has absolutely moved on it’s own before, specifically in FnaF 4
Mat is the type of guy to solve a games lore that hasn't been leaked yet
Some ideas that I will have:  Abby would act like Jacob or the kid in the first book being with the Pictures and Foxy as I feel like it would move with only her seeing it.   It might be kind of following the plot from the first book mainly about a character that ends up going to the plaza and have lost a younger brother or so they think.   I feel like Mike would be revealed that he was already dead and the brother was still alive like Charile in the book.  Golden Freddy is sans /jk  Vanessa used to work at fnaf then at security breach.   I believe that the adults misstooken it as the animatronics wanted to protect her from child murderer being William.
The fact that this is real is unreal. I was at universal recently and there was a FnNAF movie poster in eyesight range of nintendo land. Mario and FNAF are now in the same canonical universe. And if Ness and Mario are in the same game, that means that Undetale and FNAF are in the same universe. But hey that’s just a theory! A GAME THEORY! Thanks for watching.
Am I the only one who is bummed about mikes brother being kidnapped and killed rather than dying in the bite of 83.
Let’s just appreciate how Mat has “Solved” the FNAF movie when it hasn’t even come out yet. o7
its honestly looking like Mikes brother got kidnapped. Mike saw the kidnapper at his previous job. and now times are so hard. he is forced to get a job with that very kidnapper. but I doubt he knows he is there yet.
What if the police officer was Vanessa's mom?
The movie gonna be bad but because it’s a big franchise name people Gonna go see it and it’s gonna make money
Still upset matpat isn't in the movie
All my FNAF knowledge is from Game Theory, and come October, I’m giving em my hard-earned doubloons!
Your explanation makes so much more sense. I was so confused when I saw the cast list. It makes more sense if it isn't canon to the current lore. Unless it's going to be a different time line
How many times has mat Pat tried to predict fnaf?
What if Vanessa is here now to show that she was a person once before in the 90s that William hired. And like Matt said, she helped trap him in the wall to decay for year and years. What if William found a woman looking just like her and traumatizing the girl into thinking she is Vanessa so William can get back at the real woman through his mind. Maybe???
No not watching this video no spoilers! 🫣
I could be wrong, but isn't the torture device supposed to be golden Freddy's suit?
The 5th kid is wearing a striped shirt, that's his characteristic
isn't  mike dad William afton
WAS THAT CORYKENSHIN!!!?!??!
Hey Matt, the 5th kid from the trailer who didn’t have a characteristic is wearing a striped shirt. We don’t see the puppet in any of the trailers but this is where my mind was at when I saw this. Hope it’s useful :)
The unknown kid should be MUSIC MAN!!!!!!
Doesn’t the extra kid look like puppet with the stripes?
Google meat
This video is just spoilers cause, no matter how much he denies it, MatPat gonna be the post credits scene. Police gonna be looking at the Pizzaria and say something like "I don't get it. I think we should call ask our expert about this stuff" only for Mat to come up, camera slowly goes from his feet to his face where he says "I have a theory".
Hey Matt can you do a theory on Miss Peregrine's home for peculiar children the movie pls
counter theory to that fifth kid being Mr. Cupcake. What if they have no defining features because they posses End 01? We do see him move in FNaF 1 so its a possibility. My original theory on the animatronics wanting Abby to join them was for her to posses Mr. Cupcake but idk anymore.
Isn't the "thing" a mask being forced on? I would assume those are the mechanics turning that the movie interprets as "stuffing" them into suits.
How to make a springlock suit for a style theory video
Vegans hate google "meet"
Next up, Freddy food and Freddy style lore!
We used to point over people's shoulders and say "look Nebraska" to distract people.
Wait Abby is Mikes sister and not daughter?
I walked to my car to get stuff I forgot during that lengthy ad read. Thanks for the exercise.
The fifth child there may not be the cupcake, but rather, *DRUMROLL PLEASE!*  The Puppet. As we see in FNaF2’s end of night mini-games, The Puppet stares into the eyes of the FNaF1 Freddy. this confirms that the Puppet IS an active character in the FNaF 1 location. Plus, the striped shirt REALLY makes it obvious.
Given the striped shirt, I'm more inclined to believe the kid at 15:20 is for the puppet instead of the cupcake. Especially given your reasoning of them including series staples in this movie regardless of timeline location.
Chucky can split into more then one soul that can split
My theory is that Mike never had a brother and it was him that got kidnapped. His memory repressing the traumatic the event, much like Charlie. And in this movie both abby and will get gone got scooped. Abby becoming Baby and Mike somehow surviving and becoming purple mike.
Mimecraft, stardew valley and now fnaf? WHY DO THEY NEED COOKBOOKS?!?!? Except stardew that one's cool.
Um balloon boy is going to be in it sooo
I got to meet Matthew Lillard at a con in March, we told him we were excited for the FNAF movie and he told us "I always come back", like how Afton does in the games. So i totally think we have been shown something different in the trailer than we will see in the movie.
It might just be me but is this just gonna be the musical again I mean you have michael not related to William you have him looking for jobs a modern looking suit for a murderer etc
Bro's already solved the movie before it came out💀
It’s not even out
How did I only now realize that Peeta Mellark is Mike Schmidt 💀
POOR MATTPATT YOU can’t escape Fnaf anymore. It is an everything that you will be theorizing.
I think that fifth kid is gonna be the puppet and everyone will get shocked like pikachu
I like how fnaf started as a point and click game to have it come full circle
MAT PAT DO A THEORY ABOUT NOT YOUR NORMAL KIDS SHOW PLZ PLZZZZ
MAT PAT DO A THEORY ABOUT NOT YOUR NORMAL KIDS SHOW PLZ PLZ
MAT PAT DO A THEORY ABOUT NOT YOUR NORMAL KIDS SHOW PLZ
Now that MATPAT has explained the plot, what's the point of watching the movie?
Actually if you think about it all the chanles represent the animatronics GameT=freddy FilmT=foxy FoodT=chica FashionT=bon
Yo matpat mike and William afronta fake names all the times in the games, can’t it just be that William is faking so there can be a twist later on in the film for general audiences?
I mean it’s a stretch but isn’t that kid wearing a striped shirt? Like it’s probably not going to be the puppet or golden Freddy (I feel like that would be a shift that’s too extreme considering that it doesn’t seem to be the crying child or Henry’s daughter) but still
:0)
never have i seen google meet advertisement
Matpat your probably more right but I’m gonna say for fun (I’m probably wrong)with all the children I’m that one scene everyone had a character trait and the 5th one might be 🥁 🥁 the puppet because his shirt is striped just like the puppets arms and it would give him a character trait just like the other four I’m probably wrong but who cares
I have a Brazen idea on who that fifth kid is...Marionette. Look at the strips on his shirt. That screenshot with the 5 kids does remind me of the Happiest Day minigame from FNAF 3
(everyone theorizing) me just hoping the movie is good
if the movie gets delayed i'm blaming it on you for solving the story of the movie
literally me who lives in Nebraska
Bro was even searching the twitter posts from the actors 💀
What if the child wearing the stripes is the puppet?
What if he was the puppet?
MATPAT REALASED A W VIDEO ON MY BIRTHDAY 🎂🎂
Food theory idea: How dangerous is Freddy Fazbear's food?
Dave Miller? what kind of loser is named Dave Miller pfft🙈 (EDIT) (I'm David Miller so im better)
BRO THE MOVIE AINT EVEN OUT YET
This is putting a lot of faith in the writers lore knowledge that I don’t think the movie has
Not joking what is Five nights at Freddy’s
The crying child as the cupcakes
It’s all your fault I even know FNAF exists Repent to the fan
Bruh chill the movie don’t release for another month
This is a good Siri, but based off of the TOH finale, I don’t think I can ever trust. Any fan fuse, based off a tree over again.
What is five nights at Freddy’s
lucas grant's instagram getting shut down after this one
Can't wait for mike to burn the whole thing down in the sixth sequel
oh matthew millk the cow milk it till its dryyyyyyyyy
Fun fact: Lillard's IMDV USED to say Micheal Afton months ago
When I saw this I physically screamed noooooooooooo my my brain hurts please
1:14 I just didn’t use YouTube for that time period.
I'm pretty sure the kid wearing yellow represents golden freddy, and the kid wearing brown represents freddy fazbear All of them are wearing the same color pallette as the corresponding animatronics, I'm very confident about this
Mat needs to do a boywithuke lore vid
Chica’s cupcake has been able to move on it’s own before as it did it in FNAF VR
Spoilers for the video      I thought there was a popular theory that The Cupcake was Chica's dog?
Just imagine he’s right- he probably is tho..Ngl I couldn’t imagine the legend responding to this😂😂
Amazing video
I was waiting for this video! 😅
I have an idea for who I think the fifth child is. Note that he’s wearing a striped shirt. There’s one animatronic that’s missing from the main cast, and I think it’s intentional to surprise us. What other animatronic do we know has stripes? The puppet! The fifth child has to be the puppet!
mattpat's gonna cancel the fnaf movie 💀
10:31 Google meet is what matpat use? I thought it was discord?
i feel like mat is the only one who can make me actually watch his sponsors
Child 5 is wearing strips and the cupcakes wrapping has stand out stripes just up and down not sideways. Soooo , I don't think you're far off just not as obvious as the others
Matpat, the fifth kid does have a characteristic: the striped shirt
Obviously, Freddy has blue eyes because he is Sans.  There is no other explanation!
Finally the big brown bear is on screen!
how...
Cupcake boy's shirt matches Cupcakes candle. Just sayin
Here it comes, the beginning of this channel being taken over by FNAF like the main channel
I get their reasoning, but at the same time, idk why I just want a 1 to 1 replica of the games in movie form.
it could be mike in the picture.
I'm fairly certain that the degree in the background of "Steve Raglin's" office says William Afton, but I could be mistaken.
He solved it and it aint even out yet
Producers: *Well now we're not making it.*
My theory is because we know that the games are games in-universe, the movie follows the real events that inspired the games
1:12 WAS THAT THE BITE OF 87???
Your so sneaky bro idk how in the FLUCK u find all this out, especially the security guard part like bruh whaaaaaaaaaaat
I never thought of that with the mask, it makes sense now. I thought it was just cheesy over the top movie horror it was pretty much my only complaint with the trailer.
Am I the only one who realized that 5th kid looked a lot like Cassidy?
Or maby the last soul is baloon boy , I mean we’ve seen some posters with bb in the trailers 🤔🤔
If you are right on the 5th kid being the cupcake at 15:29 then the clothes he’s wearing (stripes) matches the cupcake wrapping
Hey matpat I know this isn’t the right way to reach out but I’m 17 ive been watching the channel for more than 8 years now and I’m looking for some kind of work experiance I can do from home since I live in a small town and can’t afford a car so I was wondering if there was anything I could do to help out if you need I live in Canada by the way
Ending a presumed dead William a In a yellow suit gets sealed in a wall. Obligatory post credit scene camera lingers on his corpse when he bigns to twitch opens his eyes and screams in half rage and half pain.... "I ALWAYS COME BACK!"
Real quickly. I want to say something my boy. I don't think that that's what this movie is going for. I think it's actually a prequel to FNAF 1. What do I mean by that? Well I don't really think you mentioned the older restaurant that was supposed to rot in your timeline, but I think of that this restaurant and that's the reason why Michael Afton used the name of Mike Schmidt. It was not just to cover up his identity, but also for him to you use a name of a previous security guard.
15:24 edp445 is gonna love this
THEY ARE ALREADY PROMISING A 3RD MOVIE
I think the kid who you believe is cupcake is actually the puppet, since you said that it’s combining multiple things from different games.
Jeez, talk about a sponsorship upgrade, google meet?
The animatronics won't turn Abby into an animatronic like them, because the animatronics don't want children to suffer the same fate.
The movie hasn't even came out yet and matpat already solved the entire lore- 😔 ( or atleats some of it-)
no you didn’t
1:17 I don’t like the fact that he can say a decade ago and I remember it vividly
Mat, I got you one better. This movie is a movie inside the "IRL" universe of FNAF. Just give it some installments... Cheers!
yeah. sure you did
I had theory that the cupcake is chica's kid ghost's pet dog. That's also why the cupcake jumps and grabs guy by the throat. Like dog protecting their owner would do when attacking.  Didn't the ghost of chica was tricked cause she was looking for her dog. That's how she got lured away?
So is it safe to say this movie is an AMALGAMATION of fnaf lore? Sorry… that was bad, I’ll leave.
Sorry I know it's long but if I added everything in and explained everything detail it would be longer
was it just me who was expecting a jump scare at the end-???
No no no... Considering they said the movies are based off the first 3 games. The baby theory, wrong.
The poor kid actor is gonna get yelled at by blumhouse for leaving the comment that send MatPat sniffing around 😂
I wonder if the mysterious fifth child has something to do with the Crying Child. After all, he's wearing a striped shirt, and Scott Cawthon does not do coincidences.
Love the thumbnail!
It would be funny if Scott changed the ending just because of this theory
It's still not going to be better than Willy's Wonderland they don't have Nicolas Cage
I would think, if outfits are important to the analysis, that one should take into account that Abby is wearing a horizontal striped shirt, which is the outfit of the Crying Child/the Puppet.  Could be either her name or her outfit (or both) are a misdirect for the games' fans, to obfuscate her actual role.
bruh if matpat is right about springtrap being jumped by the animatronics instead of the good old springlock im literally about to cry
hey matpat in fnaf 4 if you don't check on chica's door, cupcake kills you
>:(
Mat… the “remnant extractor” is used by Baby version of Charlie in the Fourth Closet I think when she was approaching the Police officers son (I forgot his name)
Fun idea would be talking abt spring lock suits in style theory idk what but yk smth is smth
I was here...
With the cupcake guy, did u not notice the striped shirt
Mat Pat: I'm gonna solve security breach before it releases! *doesn't* also Mat Pat:I'm gonna solve the FNAF movie before it releases!
The moment I saw this…I audible said “Uh-oh…” but clicked anyway. I’m a glutton for punishment 😂 BRING IT ON
I'm positive MatPat just spoiled the whole move l
Now we gotta figure out who posseses the cupcake
Makes sense why golden freddg has one eye for one soul Not shared by 2 souls
can you... not..
bro fr solved something that ain’t even out yet 💀
Wait but something that makes no sense is that Mike Schmidt is supposed to be Michael afton. So why would William kidnap one of his sons? I mean it's William were talking about but kidnapping your own child? Why?. I mean maybe Mikes "dad" could be just a flashback of a foster parent?
Google meet sponsored him? When did they start doing sponsorships
0:35 FISH
brooo plsss check out wrong rules T.T
11:06 end of sponsor
*Matpat is the GOAT*
Wow
1:18 finally someone shows achievement hunter content right after they retired the channel
Shut up n give me your money Matthew Patthew
No way google meet sponsored him
Matt: “The fifth kid doesn’t have an obvious animatronic” Well, obviously he’s the cupcake. The cupcake’s eyes are lit up with every other animatronic’s in the poster.  Matt: “I think he’s the cupcake” Heeeeey, I called it!
"I solv-" ITS NOT OUT YET MATHEW
Is it on Fire Tablets yet?
REMNANT??
The movie hasn’t even been out yet
MatPat deserved a role in that movie.
I really hope we get to see Afton get spring-trapped in the movie, it would be awesome to see such an iconic scene adapted to live action
Naw cause I need a FNAF Twisted Ones movie, those animatronics scary asff
Love the theory! It was amazing! I can't wait for the FNaF movie, especially since I'm a big fan of the franchise! But I was wondering if you could do a theory and/or reaction about the AVM and/or AVA series created by Alan Becker. His stick figure series are not only incredibly animated, but also full of lots of creative story writing and story foreshadowing. And with the cliffhanger of the latest episode for the AVA series, I think it's worth doing a theory on at best. Plus, it doesn't involve killer animatronics or body possession, so yeah.
Theory: Greg Heffley is the actual Crying Child/Mikes younger brother.
My secret to not knowing is i was yonger then most subs
Good timing, BlumHouse doesn't have enough time to see this and reshoot the movie without it being obvious
plot twist will be cory keshin will actually be the villain
Why hello there, old sport!
That theory is incorrect! Mat Pat actually try to make a decent theory
That Freddy in Space drawing was a fun Easter egg.
Mini theory the kid that matpat thinks is the cupcake is golden Freddy  Bec he is wearing a striped t shirt like crying child and he has the face and hair of cassdy wich are the two spirits controlling golden freddy
As an observation, the mystery ghost kid is wearing a shirt with horizontal stripes, alternating dark and light. Given how detail oriented this franchise is, this could support the idea that he is the movie version of the Crying Child
Why didn’t MatPat just write the movie
For style theory do one on spring lock suits or the suits if they could actually hold kids
BRO GOT SPONCERED BY GOOGLE
We ain’t gonna talk about google duo bein the sponsee
Or maybe Abby gets hurt & when she's about to die, they transfer her to Baby to save her life or sumthin'. 🤔♥️🇵🇭
I feel like its obvious now that the films and the games are gonna be separate timelines, it just doesn't make any sense otherwise
mat the shirt is striped its the crying child!!!
I think it’s bro getting stuffed 2:59
So, is Mike’s dad not William Afton? Or is that going to be one of the twists?  Wait, is Mike Schmidt actually a different character in the movie continuity?
Okay I'm sorry but it would be cool if William Afton like open the closet in the spring Bonnie suit was in it and he says well it's been awhile
Can't wait for the food theory fnaf episode
You notice how the last kid has a stripped shirt? Might mean nothing but knowing costume designs, it might not.
I always thought the cupcake was suzie's dog--
Bro got early access💀
Matpat the movie hasn’t even come out yet 😭
I left a similar comment on a Fuhnaff video a few months ago but here’s my theory on the movie: I believe that Mike is in fact, Michael Afton (mostly because I don’t want to think about redoing the lore if he ISNT an Afton). Why I believe he doesn’t recognize his own father is that after the death of the Crying Child, Mike’s parents got a divorce. Mike’s mother won custody and remarried, and Mike blocked the trauma of the bite of 83 out of his mind, along with his biological father. Later, both Mike’s mother and stepfather die, which leaves Mike to take care of Abby (whether she is his half sister or full sister, I do not know). Mike tries to get jobs to take care of his sister, so he calls up William (who has now been forced to take up a fake name because of all the conspiracies surrounding the missing kids at Freddy’s). Mike doesn’t recognize “Steve” as his father, but William recognizes him.  At the end of the movie (or near the end at least), I believe there is going to be a Star Wars episode 5 type of twist where William has a “I am your father” type moment and Mike will remember his biological father.  That’s just my thoughts though and how I would want it to go if I was making the decisions, what do you guys in the comments think will happen?  (Also a funny note I saw someone point out on Tumblr; “Steve Raglin” is an anagram of “everlasting” which could possibly be a reference to “I always come back.”)
Hey MatPat u ok with reaction videos?
MATPAT CHILL DOWN! THE MOVIE HASNT EVEN COME OUT YET
I'm excited for fnaf 4 in movie version
Is the 5th kids striped shirt not curious 🤔 ?
Only wilderness people will understand that😂
Matpat be like Vanessa (security breach time )would be around the age Elizabeth would be if she didn't die, literally time: well matpat according to you evan was scared of fnaf animatronics cause he saw elizabeth get killed... but then how would Elizabeth be around 20 by security breach timing even though it takes place like 2040 or something...🤨🤨🤨
Finally he made a vid on it im so hyped for this movie!!
That cook book is out at my book fair💀
To be fair, I've never watched any FNAF gameplay or played the games myself. The only reason I know so much about it is from watching all of MatPat's videos.
The other hint at Afton being Lillard is the trailer showing Springtrap wiping his blade, that caused me to Scream.
I’m actually under the impression that Mike Schmitt will be turned into golden Freddy about halfway through the movie. I think that the machine near the beginning of the video is the scooper and Mike gets caught by it and turned into golden Freddy. Which is also why Abby is spending time with him. She’s clearly seen hanging out with Golden Freddy away from Mike and since Mike is her primary caretaker I would expect that the only reason she has to not be seen where we think he is is because he’s golden Freddy.
The blonde kid in a striped shirt has got to be the puppet
I'm confused why are people barely realizing that the cupcake moves by itself until now
Me and my friend were talking about how we would find FNaF shtuff on film theory.
THE MAN BEHIND THE SLAUGHTERRRR
I have one simple thing to say about this video                                               Nuh uh!
OMG PEETA MILLARK IS THAT YOU
Now, this video is sponsored by Google meet, but which one is it? "Google meet" or "Google meet (original)"?
Alaska is better than nebraska
I thought he was crying child
I have a feeling that William is still Mike's dad, Mike just doesn't know it. William could've divorced his wife when Mike was young and didnt know a lot about stuff and his brother was also maybe just born. Abby could be the child of Mike's new step-dad.
First fnaf took over GT and GTLive and now FT it’s coming for all the channels 😂😂
Bro glances at a trailer and then he solves the entire plot of it and the sequels plot
I like ur intros
If we are talking remnant and agony, it is perfectly possible for the same entity that possesses Chica is also in the cupcake as how Andrew divided his anger infecting multiple objects in the stitchwraith stories…
The kid who you thing is golden Freddy, is not him at all. check out the shirt, it has stripes making me thing of the Puppet
you gave me a heart attack at the start
Still kinda weird seeing Matpad talking about FNAF on Film Theory, pretty cool!
Hello matpat I know you may not see this but I feel you should be in the FNAF movie but as a younger version who just heard about the missing children (I know it doesn’t make much sense) but I just had it on my mind and wanted to say it
HES BROWN, BROWN IS FREDDY. THE YELLOW & TOPHAT IS GOLDEN
The movie hasn’t even come out yet 😭😭
Ah yes the child wearing the blue pants and grey striped shirt is not the same as the other child with blue pants and grey striped shirt
FNAF ON FILM THEORY?!? THE DAY HAS FINALLY COME!
All I learned from this is that Willem Dafoe isn't actually in the movie
I'm not into horror so I gotta ask, has there been any horror that gets a some semblance of a happy ending?
Susie in some old fnaf game: cries over dead dog and Afton says he isn't really dead, matpats brain: I don't understand this let's just forget it. My theorist brain: THE CUPCAKE IS SUSIE'S DOG!!!  Ps:if I said an wrong name, fnaf is confusing and I'm talking about chica
7:00 they could still hide stuff on the wall in the move. Most trailers have seans similar to what Is in the move but not exactly what is in It.
if you look hard enuf, film theory really says fil M The ory o.0 what does it mean ~ OoooOooOoo
1:51 is literally such a matpat thing to say
The only thing is, if your theory is correct that would mean that the bite of 83 wouldn’t take place, and that’s too iconic of a scene to scrap from the movie franchise, unless they put some sort of twist on it
Solved before film is released, Now Scott is going to delay it longer & add in some more final cut changes. It'll be interesting to come back to this once the film is released. I'll keep these points in mind when watching the film. Tack for the insight & break through, Keep up the great work Mate 🐺🐾
Solid theory yet again from LORD MATPAT!!!
Bro putting them in a wall? Na the water droplet goes down and we see the famous scene of michel appleton
Don’t watch Film Theory much but if he’s talking FNAF I’m hear.
Bro chill out the movie haven't even come out
google meat
Was up man
that 5th kid in the trailer had a striped shirt
I heard "Google Meet" and my brain was like "Google Meat? What??" it's been a long night
he missed the opportunity at the start to say "it's been so long~"
I think part of the story is that when Mike has suppressed memories of his past and while working there he has visions or nightmares of his past trauma involving his murderous father William, the missing children, and his little brother's death. While discovering these memories he tasks himself to search for answers while also putting some vengeful spirits to rest.
Solved The FNAF Movie?! 👀 Till Scott adds in a few more last min changes (Kekw) Can't wait to dive into this Theory & come back after the film is released to see what was accurate. Bet it was just as fun to put together as the games & books timeline. Danke for sharing, Hope everyone is doing well. Keep It Up Team! 🐻 😎 👊
Scot cawthon “one of the worst thing that can happen to this movie is somebody predicting the whole plot”   Film theory:
0:59 game theory be like he took my Mario toy OK it’s fine. It’s fine you took my sonic toy still fine it’s fine. Then you took my last of us toys still fine, but little mad but now you have crossed the line with five nights at Freddy’s. That’s my toy.
since when was matpat a dad
I’m sorry, but I’ve been teaching my friend abt the lore (she left around 2016 💀) and I’m so excited for it tbh lol Also TY ABT THE NEBRASKA THING. ALSO THE PARENTS ARENT IN THEIR LIVES, IT WAS IN THE CHAR DESCS. IDK IF U MENTION IT ALSO THE BABYSITTER THERES A DEMO SCENE WITH ABBY AND MAX, OR THE BABYSITTER! Whew! Im good! Im only 6 min in tho
3 minute google ad lol W
what if that 5th kid is the puppet? stripped shirt = stripped limbs?
11:40 I shat bricks
bro now they are gonna delay the movie too 😭😭
Wasn't there a casting slot for a "female antagonist" though?
I’ve waited so long, days? No. Months? No. Years, yes… years, just for a film theory on Five Nights at Freddy’s.
THE DEBUT OF FNAF ON FILM THEORY
It’s bled to the other channels….
Gotta ask how afton would hide a corpse in the cupcake, I also love that they armed Afton, so glad he didn’t get the Vanny treatment
2:56 my first thought at seeing this thing was an on-screen adaptation of a Scooper ?
I am a Utahn and all I have to say is where is the elk and seagull animatronics at because they are Utahs state animals after all come on that would be so cool even a cougar would be cool.
When the movies comes out, MatPat is gonna see it like ten times with a notepad in hand within a week, guaranteed.
careful now they'll change it last minute
I google meat all the time
I'm liking and subbing cuz I saw Cory in 1:23
Here me out what if phone guy in a bear suit bust through a wall with a flame thrower chainsaw and burns  down Freddy’s 👀 if ykyk
Thanks to this videos Sponsor: Google Hangou -- I mean Meets. Google Meets, totally not related to Google Hangouts.
I don’t agree with the ending about Abby, but I’m happy that Matpat is taking a step forward on how much content FNAF is getting this year.
THE BOY IN THE STRIPED SHIRT IS THE PUPPET
Okay now just figure out how to make a theory on FNaF for style theory, and step 2 for Universe 100% will be done
The thing with cupcake, you say we've never seen it have it's own soul, however in help wanted in the chica repair room, you see cupcake hop off the plate and run around, great theory though 😊
I don't know what's creepier springtrap or MatPat stalking children Instagram pages for clues
This movie is going to be AWESOME! No matter what happens.
I mean, Afton in the books changed his name to Dave Miller to avoid the law.
Bro actually made the fnaf movie but refuses to tell us, learn the truth homies
0:36 fish
*THE MOVIE IS NOT OUT.*
11:40 that scene is based of  a  fan film called the hug im down to see the fnaf movie its just make me sad
I think Susie's dog is possessing the cupcake
what if abby has a fun disc that makes here look different.... maybe abby is baby during the whole movie and the sound illusion discs are at work the whole time
I wonder if psychic friend fredbear will be in the movie...
Matpat you’d better be careful. Before you know it the movie will be delayed 2 years, and when the final product comes out it won’t match the original trailers at all
Mattpat gotta be my favorite youtuber
Dude it isn’t even out yet
jesus Matpat, its not even out yet!
karl is the cupcakes name and hes prolly possesed karl was always alive, if you replay Fnaf 4 karl is the only remnent of chica to jumpscare you
Day 76: of asking for a theory on sevenundersouls
The movie hasnt even realeased and hes already solved it 💀
Can you let the movie come out
I want googles meat
But matpat who is Cassidy
Very unexpected sponser But epic video today🗿
Two thoughts. 1) What if the cupcake is possessed by Susie's dog? 2) Kid 5 has a striped shirt
I still like my hypothesis that Mike and abby are the kids of William and they are living with adopted parents because William is a prime suspect in the death of 6 kids
People who doesn't have knowledge of fnaf lore should not judge the ending if it is tragic.
i never understood the idea of the animatronics trying to make abby like them...if you were a kid that got killed and is haunting a gient robot...why whou you want to hurt anouther kid?!? it doesnt make sence.... attack the adults and protect the kid like the books
Bud, how did you even do this. It’s not even out yet 💀
whats a fnaf
Wait.. The girl is suppose to be mike's sister?... He looks to be in his 30's and abby looks about 8-10.. So how would that work?..his parents waited kik20-25 years to have a second kid?... Makes more sense for her to be his daughte despite that not being a thing in the gamesr.. Guess that's what happens when a film tries mixing different points in a game series's timeline into one amalgamation.. Oops
Otititititktititififfkkfkttkt
The fnaf cookbook is already out in schoollastick book fairs
Gkgkgkgkgkgkgkgkggk
The only question i have left is why your not in it
The striped shirt of the last kid remind u guys of anyone?
Seeing fnaf on film theory feels somewhat out of place. And I love it
I still don’t think the ghost kids are actually wanting Abby to join them. After all, we get this “revelation” from Vanessa. Why would be believe Vanessa?!?!
8:24 "like mAn i always come back!"
LoL wait... Google meet? G+ has risen as a zombie and is in line to die again?
MatPat is the true hero of the internet, solving things so we don't have to... thanks 🔥
THE MOVIES NOT OUT
he immediately makes a video as soon as he can, esspecially FNAF.
Count on me there will be a sequel 😮
Can’t wait to watch it
I liked this video but now I'm worried you just spoiled the movie D:
Maybe the other kid in the dream sequence is the puppet, as the puppet was "seen" in the FNAF 2 minigames in the FNAF 1 Pizzeria location. Scott also mentioned how he wanted to add the puppet in FNAF 1, but added it to FNAF 2 instead. But hey, that's just a theory...
8:13 PFFFT HAHAHAHA im sorry, i just look at willard's face and all i see is shaggy rodgers!
I honestly feel like Abby isn't going to, or even be tried to turn into one of them, at least from the animatronics. As stated in the games, the animatronics have an issue with adults, but not kids, as stated in Fnaf 2. Meaning that Abby would become friends with them, as they're kids stuck into the suits and possessing them. However, William Afton/Springtrap would probably be against this, leading to Abby being in the line of fire to Afton, not the other animatronics
Ofc you solved the fbaf movie already
I'm still thinking that there is Susie's dog in Chica's cupcake... but I know Matpat will never see this comment 😢
Isn’t the cupcake named Carl
Mattpat: I solved this! Theorist team:......
15:07 Matt, I don’t know how to tell you this, but the kid in the brown shirt is gonna be Freddy, and the kid in the top hat and YELLOW SHIRT is going to be Golden Freddy.
it would be awesome if garrett ended up being golden freddy because then we'd be able to somewhat confidently call crying child garrett
And here I thought that the last kid was the puppet since I was just listening instead of watching lol
11:41 looking like it has 2 mouths, the Freddy mouth and the endoskeleton inside, maybe funaf is onto something with golden Freddy merely being a suit/costume
I am sticking with that "remnant extractor” is the FNAF 1 game over screen when you lost anywhere in the night
I love all of your theories across all channels! They’re so good! Keep up the good work😁🤟🫶
Matpat really treating the trailer as a warm-up.  Man has always been insane ever since fnaf came out.
Maybe Abby forces afton into the walls by climbing into the clown suit. It could be a mechanical power up? Just a thought.
A lot of people have talked about Mike's not recognizing William. What surprises me is how so many haven't considered repression of memories as trauma response to explain the lack of recognition.
Calm down it has not even come out yet
Great theory as always. My one thought is that the fifth unidentified kid isn't the cupcake (because...I hate that and don't want the freaking cupcake to be posessed.)  I think he's the puppet. Purely going off the stripes on his shirt. But they do match the pattern of the puppets arm. and of all the characters you'd expect to pop up in the film The puppet would seem unlikely but I think people would go NUTS if it showed up. It would definitely lead to fodder for the second movie too.
Woah
That moment when you find out team theorist are android users 😢
the movie isn't even out yet 😭😭😭😭😭
Or in the movie Afton breaks the suits apart individually like in the game just to get springlocked near the end and then they seal up the wall leading up to him being found 30 years later in the sequel
Bro about to delay the movie by having a theory
Bro. It hasn’t Evan came out
Google meeet!
I mean, they are putting everything into this move...since well    *_its scotts last project, be happy it happend... :,>_*
Wooooo!!!
10:26 twist, matpat is his own parents
Nebraska is not real
I kinda think Mike is using golden Freddy as a springlock suit
Blumhouse after seeing this video:  “Well god digedy darn, he dun figured it out again!”
Wanna bet that Steve character (Played by Matthew Lillard) is William Afton under a different name due to him being possibly the main suspect of kidnapping those children in the movie?
Matpat thinks that the kid wearing golden-yellow clothes represents Freddy, and the kid wearing brown is the cupcake. Yes, this seems right.
NONONONO
Brown shirt kid is Freddy. Freddy wears a bowler hat, not a top hat. Golden Freddy/Fredbear is the only one who wears a top hat.
That ‘87 slide joke nearly killed me, good job MatPat
I still think the striped shirt kid is supposed to be Golden Freddy. The two spirits associated with Golden Freddy are Cassidy, who is represented by dark and/or curly hair, and Crying Child. What does Crying Child always wear? A striped shirt.
Mat pat over a month before someone comes out: I KNEW IT
I just wanna say, Dave miller from the book, I have a teacher with TH EXACT SAME LAST NAME AS DAVE MILLER!!!!!!!!!!! Is that a coincidence or something?????? I hope so
If MatPat wants to know how it's possible to be on Youtube, or make Youtube content and not know about FNAF... he needs to talk to GoodTimesWithScar.
couldn't the stripped-shirt kid be the marionette/puppet?
Ngl I thought the other kid was the crying child
Yo chill It hasn't even come out yet
THE FIFTH KID HAS STRIPES ON HIS SHIRT MATPAT 15:04
So I know I ain’t may pat but here’s something I noticed  In the scene with fredbear and Abby, he only has one blue eye  In the games, there are two spirits in golden freddy and it’s always shown to have two different colored eyes (at least in matpats videos)  It was just something I noticed
Leave it Mathew Patrick the fourth to use real people having fun with other actors as solid evidence for solving a mystery of a game the can't be solved comfortably
“ IT SHOULD HAVE been poopy “ 😭
The kid might be the crying child....
Google meet was a "forced app I despised" before this video.  Only you guys could change my mind on that. 😊
Google meet actually getting sponsored
Yeah the ghost of chica splitting her soul to be in two different bodies sounds crazy, reread Coming Home from fazbear frights, were we see The ghost split herself between chica n her own self, it’s happened before Matpat
I really thought the fifth kid wearing the striped shirt would represent the puppet, not the cupcake. It’s a subtle choice but the shirt is the same color scheme while not looking exactly the same
I'm just gonna point out that the kid that we don't know the identity of has a striped shirt, which may be a reference to the crying child, but the stripes may also be a reference to the puppet, since on it's arms and legs it has stripes. Then again i'm just pointing it out; i'm probably wrong but i hope i've added something useful to this conversation 😊👍
The Hug and Willy's Wonderland set the bar so high, this movie better be good.
watch
I hope that mat doesnt get these actors in trouble, with him "solving" the plot with the posts of the actors meeting each other when logically they shouldnt in character/on set, idk, i just hope this movie was worth the wait
@cha.momilie9571
Bro do a springtrap theory on fashion theory
homie it isnt out yet how have you solved it- im baffled
Could it not be baby from the books? It looks like a face.
Sup
The saw is used in the books with the Funtime Freddy Saw guy
bet you anything baby is already built and in the end abby is the girl they have  get snatched by the child grabbing secret compartment.
I'm not sure if what I'm about to say is under Film Theory or Good Theory but, Who eats more Goku or Luffy?
I literally thought about the cupcake thing right before the video 😂
i can confirm the sponcer, THANK YOU GOOGLE
Dude the movie isn’t even out and you solved it💀
He's got a striped shirt and he's in the front and you DIDN'T think he was the crying child? 15:30
FNAF Style Theorist idea:  Could you survive getting springlocked/getting stuffed in an animatronic?  You’re welcome.
I am also pretty sure that mike is a criminal or has committed so kind of crime, maybe when he was shown betting a guy up in the pool maybe he went over board stoping someone and got sued couldn’t pay it off and if he doesn’t make the cash he goes to jail so he makes cut to make bail or something and know cannot pay rent that can also explain why Vanessa is there as his patrol officer or something like that.
If there isn’t a spring lock failure in the movie, I’ll be sad
Sure bro did theories on like the s cond day of the game/movie being released but it's not out yet
This movie isn't even out yet Mathew Patrick!!!!
Since this video is sponsored by google, then does anyone here know how to disable rtt calling on google phone? It seriously makes me angry everytime I want to call someone, but it turns into a glorified text message instead.
Im thinking the whole abby kidnapping thing by the animatronics is that they're trying to protect her from the percieved threat that is michael or just trying to keep her from william. That could work as a twist
0:05 oh god here he goes again with another FNaF lore video
Fnaf 4 cupcake attacks fnaf vr cupcake can jumpscare and move by itself so it's just a living robot
Including gtlive there is about 92 FNAF videos
I think the family is still the same with mike and Abby being William's (Steve Raglans) children still, with Mike and Abby being adopted after William kills his wife maybe after a divorce, forcing him to change his identity to Steve Raglan. Just a theory, though im hoping they don't completely de-rail the movies from the games or go full family friendly security breach mode.  also this isn't Springtrap in the movie its William in the Springbonnie suit which explains why it's cleaner but still has patches due to being old
nahh bro figured out the movie before it released
*Make the 87th Fnaf theory, and it will all reveal itself, no more Fnaf theories, it will be put back together.*         edit: im an og
Mat, shut up After you figuring out Security Breach and the devs watching your video, I'm traumatized Don't.
He just couldn’t wait
REMNANT?!
Evil never die, but still keep your eyes out in your mind focus on the screen this game the show will never end. Madness will never end.  There are secrets so watch out for them
I will be disappointed if there is not a MatPat cameo in the FNAF movie.
"Honestly, we have tried other services, and I hate them!" Should not have made me laugh as much as it did 😂😂😂
Now I have a reason to watch this channel
i swore the kid in brown was freddy and the one in the back was golden freddy (cuz he's wearing yellow)
You could already make a style theory on the springlock suits
Another 30 long videos from this movie series eh?
Mf let the movie come out first 😂😂😂
It's amazing to see how my friends and I would stay up on Google Meets talking about your FNaF theories when they first came out to seeing where the FNaF community has come now. Congrats MatPat for the sponsorship from GOOGLE ITSELF!!!
Who's going to see the fnaf movie instead of trick or treating this year?  👇
finally watching a fnaf video in the film theory channel brings tears to my eyes
Does anyone else think that the 5th child is the Marionette due to his striped shirt basically being the same colors as the arms of the Marionettes body. This is supposed to be a trilogy movie, what if at the end of this one there’s a nod at the puppet for their possible future role in the next movie?
I am trying to watch all sixty four episodes of Fnaf on game theory.
Isit just me that is mad that Bonnie is blue?? Isn't he pERPLE!????
how many times are you gonna solve this mystery
Google sponsored this bro how
As a nonfnaf person last time before matpats 60 ep… i always thought spring trap was golden freddy because of the color i never once looked at the face shape 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ so i was confused why springtrap and glitchtrap was related…
Of course matpat solved the fnaf movie before it came out😂😂
Mat Pat possesses shadow freddy no cap
So uhhh matpat are you mad because of this because I heard the fnaf lore is going to change😅
THE MOVIE ISN'T EVEN OUT YET, CALM DOWN MAT
Watch them change the script if Matpat is right 😂.
"We're gonna do what game theory couldnt do, solve, this, franchise!"  ...yeah yeah just like every other time you said that
The kid you said was the cupcake looks like the crying child with the striped shirt and jeans
The day it comes out is my birthday 🥳 and as a loyal theorist I shall spend taht whole day studying the movie
What about the stripes on the rando kids shirt? Might be crying kid.
I know Mat jokes about being the only one interested in researching fnaf, but I'd honestly kinda love to see how other theorist members help out in any of it.
I agree with you on everything other than the fact that there's a spirit inside the cupcake. Only because of number 1 the logic isn't there. Would we be saying that Afton stuffed a child inside the cupcake?🤣🤣 Also, from studying the FNAF wiki, the cupcake is listed as an anthropomorphic and or semi-sentient cupcake, meaning that it not only has the characteristics of a person but should have a certain level of control over itself. But I do, however, feel that there isn't a separate soul attached to it. I have two theories, one being that the cupcake is just an extension of Susie and she can control it at will, or two, it's the stand-in for her dog, seeing as how Afton tells her that something happened to her dog(or did he run over her dog, I don't remember).
In security breach there was a lot of stuff that we've never seen before, the movie could still be canon  Edit just saw more of the vid, this ain't canon
Chill out bro 💀 the movie ain't even out yet.
you know i think garret will be goldren freddy as we know a sibling gets kidnapped and if im correct refresh me if im wrong charlies brother in the books is golden freddy so if its mikes brother in goldren freddy it would be abbys brother which would also explain the cory scene abby in a taxi with golden freddy
600k people in 4 hours is insane 😮
I think the movie will be fnaf 1 meets silver eyes
It’s not even out yet man
Is it just me or does it feel like matpats sole purpose is to solve fnaf
I think Abby might actually end up being the puppet for the next movie. Abby will probably be portrayed as a protective sister. She’ll end up wanting to help the animatronics, but will end up dead. Mike will probably end up believing she’s dead setting up a sad and depressed mike for the next movie where he visits the new location just for a job in the second movie.
Not gonna lie, feel bad for the kid actor ...He made one instagram comment and whole theory got spun off and a very plausible one at that xD..>Unless he was told to comment that was a cleaver marketing strat, then they wont be to hapy for him xD.
Omg I can’t wait for the movie
Welp. Time for him to try to solve this movie for a decade.
we found out crying child's real name
The fifths kid is crying child look at the shirt
Cupcake is Susie’s dog
No the break in mustv happened later in the film
When matpat said before they met with a terrible fate he should have added the happy mask salesmen laugh. Missed opportunity man
bro got sponsored by google. what an icon.
2:46 this whole suit thingy really reminds me of count the ways, idk why
striped shirt.. hes the crying child
Hear me out. Afton is mike’s dad but stuff fell through so the mom got a divorce and remarried while the boys were yet to be born and then they got their adoptive fathers name or something and that’s why the names don’t match uo
MatPat hurry up and do a theory on Tears of the Kingdom
THERES A THING CALLED GOOGLE MEET SPONSORS???? HUHHHH???
I strongly feel that for as long as you have been covering FNAF, they should have gave you at least a small part in the film haha
This might not be correct but I'm just thinking what if the person that hires Micheal or Mike is Henry instead of William I'm just thinking I'm not saying it's true but maybe
The video game ain’t even out and this man has already solved the movie 💀
The cook book was at my middle school book fair💀💀💀💀💀💀
The kid in the stripe shirt isn't the puppet?
i wonder if vanessa has watched this video 😂😂😂
I use google meet for therapy
The twist for this movie is. Darkapiler. 😲😲
Make a theory on Team Starkid’s Hatchetfeild Series it has a lot of lore and not to mention a new show coming out the 13th of October
Haha you can always count on matpat to make a vid of fnaf
Lilliard already spilled the beans that he’s the killer back in an interview about scream and if he’d return
I really hope the movie ends with William getting springlocked
I have a question for your fnaf game theories, I love the most recent one how you explain the daycare attendant, but do you have anything on Monty? The only reference for his character is "the happiest day ever" where there seems to be a green alligator mask very similar to him. It bugs me so much that we have no idea why he is there or who he even is
for once, FINALLY for once I had the same idea as Mat before I watched a video
The girl and the boy might be golden Freddy because that boy has kind of golden Freddy characteristics and golden Freddy has 2 people inside of him
Considering Cupcake does have it's own character poster, i think you may have something on that end.
I think the use of the little brothers name being Garrett, starting with a G, is meant to correlate with Gregory. I think the crying child can finally have a name
What about the crying child... HE HAS A STRIPED SHIRT 🎽
its simple, I just dont ever see or hear about anything FNAF related (expect for this video)
the movie isnt even out yet
I don't think Garret is getting kidnapped because he would be screaming for help. I think Mike didn't have enough money to care for one child, so he let someone adopt him or have his mom take him, and wiliam afton killed him. Or you are right. I also don't think Mike and William are related. That would be a big twist for the fandom, and he would probably know who springtrap is. I don't think they would put stuff we already know, since this is going to be  a completely different timeline. This is just what I think, I'm ok if you differ.
It's coming out on my birthday🎉🥳
I feel like matpat has gone mad with the lore. Think about it. Game theory is the standard game. Film theory is like new game plus. What if there are more then one movie
Garrett's hair looks like geogary wait a minute
Fnaf style theory would be hilarious
Anyone else think Bonnie taking his mask off looked dope?
Secretly mat-pat is in the film , and hes trying to steer us off from finding out hes golden freddy
Its fun to see Fnaf spreading to the other channels lol, eventually I’m expecting to see a video about the real implications of a spring lock suit on fashion theory
The Lillard character name is a massive misdirection for casual audiences so when its revealed that he is Afton it will surprise everyone in the theater
Matpat is ligit deranged. I love it.
I think the child with the striped shirt is the puppet.
I think "The man behind the slaughter."  (Song )That could've been his brother is anyone clarified who is killed there?  Also in the wall where spring trap is and the five children that is mentioned in the fourth closet where John was passed out and the blob and other animatronics were attacking William to save the kid
I found out of fnaf two years ago
Leave it to MatPat to spoil the movie for me before it even came out :/
CAN I ISE GOOGLE MEET ON MY 3DS XL GEN1
Sir its the 5th time you said that
He already found the mystery of the fnaf movie did he just went into the future
im guessing nebraska is where the HQ is
It took so many years, but film theory finally has a Fnaf based episode, Mat can't run from fnaf no matter what channels he's in 😂
i still think that... thing lowering onto his head is just a freddy head. what with fnaf 1 saying they are "filled with crossbeams, wires, and other animatronic devices, especially around the facial area"
I think that golden freddya good and will help protect Abby because in some movie photos and trailers you can see golden Freddy and Abby together
WE GOING TO THE CINEMA'S WITH THI ONE 🔥🔥🗣 🔥
Seems like they threw all the lore and logic out the window
Here's a theory for you to debunk:  What role are you playing in the movie?
bro really got sponsored by google
I can see the actors auditioning for this movie watching matpats time line to prepare for the audition 😂😂
They should make a sister location movie and a fnaf 4 movie
Bro be solving movies with only trailers
i'm just imagining Micheal shoving a dead child into Chica's cupcake rn lol
It's almost like movie trailers basically spoil the movie.
The series lives on... 😢
My theory: William afton will come back.
If this isn’t actually the plot of the movie.. I’m being lied to. It absolutely is.
Im excited to watch the movie then rewatch this and see how close he gets
2:45 idk it looks like the blob wothout the mask
Mat pat is the only guy who can connect a block of lunchable cheese to julias ceaser💀
YEAHHHHH NEBRASKA SUPERIORITY.
Isn't it crazy how alot of us got into fnaf in middle or elementary school and alot of us are now in high school or university
0:01 Hello times viewers
I didn't notice this was Film Theory 😂 I assumed it was Game Theory and didn't check.
its amazing how everyone milked this series for years 😂😂😂😂 scott cawthorn really made a masterpiece
I think its cool that golden freddy only has one lit eye. Does that mean that there is only 1 soul in golden Freddy at this point??
God i want the springlock scene GIMME!!!!
matpat is the only guy who can spoil something that hasnt come out yet
When markiplier thinks he solved FNAF for the 30th time
I cant wait for the bite of 83
the kid with the striped shirts isn't the cupcake it's the puppet the puppet has stripes on his arms so it would make sense for the kid to be the puppet
Random thought: what if Bonnie started playing the dr Phil music on his guitar
Cupcake kid isnt actually cupcake.. My guess hes marionette because of the stripes. It only fits because of the characteristics but y'know.
The Fnaf Studio is coming after your for trying to spoil the entire movie 💀
What if Mike goes to the counselor thinking he is helping him in his job search and action shows him this job in order to put another unsuspecting person in this position.
The Fnaf movie is copying Willy's wonderland a lot  leave a comment if that yes
Never thought I’d see a FILM Theory FNAF episode, yet here we are
What if the fifth kid is supposed be this movie's version of Charlie?   Think about it he's even got stripe's on like marionette does! 🧐
Wait the theorists count as a company….
So matts theory is we will get a spring trap scene?
I think 5th kid is the puppet because striped shirt!!!
Imagine, you and 4 of your friends get murdered and posses giant robots, While you are stuck possessing a cupcake.
Bruh its not even out yet
please retire
Mat should play afton in the movie
Gotta love cupcake after being In this franchise for so long and being relegated as a side peace to now step forth into the light and be a bigger part and as MatPat suggests to even be separately possessed by on of the five children is making me love this movie even more
the movie didnt even come out
I think the “fifth” kid is supposed to be freddy while the kid with the tophat is supposed to be Golden Freddy…
Calling it now post credit scene of William moving after being spring locked and trapped for years
Dang, spoiled the whole movie for me.
Where is golden Freddy or cassidy
Matpat.. the boy is wearing a striped shirt.. HES WEARING A STRIPPED SHIRT.. HES NOT THE CUPCAKE😭🤚
Bro how the movie didn't even come out yet
Idk but when i. first saw the trailer I assumed that golden freddy in the car with Abby was possessed by Mike
sponsored by google meet is insane
No need to see the movie and get terrified anymore.  Thank you. Edit: I still watched and he was partly wrong, and partly right
Watch interface by umami Matt Patt
R.I.P fnaf movie writers there is going to be some crazy crunch time to rewrite the plot 💀
the puppet is totally gunna be a character that they have kept a secret. that 5th kid is the puppet
Imagine when the movie would finally release and MatPat would possibly be the first person to point out the bite of 83 in about 3 seconds.
Matpat should get a cameo in the novie
E
I actually hope that markiplier makes a cameo
Matpat wrote the movie
I like your ideas
Mike is probably Michael Afton who changed his last name, and Abby is elizibeth. BuT sHe DiEd!!!  So I presume mike tried to take a by away from william but she ended up staying with her precious daddy, we all know what happens next
Poor Mat.
No you didn't
So, I accidentally discovered that a second Official FNAF Coloring Book is set to be released next year. This one labelling itself as a glow-in-the-dark colouring book this time with 24 scenes being glow-in-the-dark. You know, considering how Matpat dismissed the first one and the how to draw books, it's a little odd that a sequel to it is coming soon. I once again ask for him to use the original and the how-to-draw books as they're meant to be used. By doing so, I'm sure something important will reveal itself. Even if you need page bleed through to do it.
Bro how did FNAF theories get to the 2nd channel 💀
Honestly, i have never played any fnaf game, all my knowledge come from these theories
Part of this video is sponsored by Google, the other half is sponsored by Matt’s madness for FNAF theories.
ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET AND HE SOLVED IT...WHAT!
anyone else at 15:21 and instantly go cupcake? why not the puppet? stripped shirt? That's kind of the puppets thing isnt it? Am I alone in this idea?
I think Mike becomes Golden Freddy at the end of the film.
Aint no way he said the cupcake
Bruh here we go again, also that hand jump scare wasn’t terrifying
and now fnaf has been on 3 (4 if you count the food theory intro)/5 channels in the theory cinematic universe..... how long til we get a style theory on the springlock suits?
I think the 5th kid could be the crying child and/or marionette, based off his taller stature and the stripes on his shirt
Aye at least itll be on peacock day 1 for your eventual 2nd 3rd and 4th viewing to give us more theories
I got coworkers who never heard of FNAF and 2 are gen Z 2 are young melenials and the rest who I work close to are either old Melenials or young gen X. Crazy I know😅
I have a Theory that everyone assumes that Matthew Lillard is going to play the William Afton of this, but what is if everyone was wrong and instead he is the Henry Emily instead and Mike's Dad is actually the main villain instead.
The 5th kids shirt is stripes, puppet maybe? Idunno but if this is somehow a mashed up of all the games then maybe? Or is he the crying child? What you guys think?
hI! hELLO! :)
WHEN YOU WALK AAAA-WAY YTOU DON'T HER ME SAY, *PEAAAAAAAAAAASE*,  OH *_BAAAAAAAAAAAABYYYYYYYYYY_*. DON GO!!!
But they have to have Afton get crushed by his own suit, right? I kinda feel like that's a detail you can't leave out.
Deviating from the books and games is the smartest thing they could do. It's hard to try to juggle a bunch of existing lore and events. Your choices become either follow it faithfully, which will require leaving things out and alienating the general moviegoers, or restrict yourself in hopes of getting sequels, which is never a guarantee.
MatPat please, the movie could be delayed /lhj
Can't wait for Nick Cage to show up at the end of the movie and have an epic showdown with Freddy
THE SIXTH KID IS G FREDDY, STRIPED SHIRT IS DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC
HOTTER THAN JAMES ON A SUNDAY AFTERNOOON BABAAAAAY
MY BODY IS REGGIE
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY MIKE
Google meets been crashing for over a month for me. Used to love it. 😢
Maybe it’s chipper or the security robot
Bro solved the movie before it’s even watchable
The fifth kid has a striped shirt like the striped candle in the cupcake tho
Can't wait for this one movie to spawn dozens of Film Theory Videos......
Wait his name is golden fredbear I though I was golden freddy I watched the entire fnaf lore and his name suddenly changes?
But I was already recipes for banana food in the ultimate guide
that 6th kid could be the puppet
If they go with the ending you said they might have to put the spring lock failure scene
Uh
My prediction is actually pretty close except for one key detail, i think vanessa is lying about the animatronics wanting Abby to be like them because 1 theyre out of costumes and 2 thats never been a plot point for one animatronic, let alone the collective, elsewhere in the  franchise and so i think it would be a weird turn to take, and it would make a compelling differences between our two protagonists because while Mike has been taking information from a source that would love to hide the truth, that shes the equivalent of a Saw apprentice and the robots being the killer would make the perfect cover story, Abby is interacting with the souls herself. I think vanessa being attacked is a "youve failed me where is she" sort of deal where vanessa was the one who informed Afton about Abby being there
2:11 Right, matpat. Lets get you back to bed.
Is this Game Theory
Bro, there's no way matpat solved the fnaf movie before release, bros got a source
When a game theory gets too close before launch, they can haphazardly change the twists and release it in a buggy mess to be fixed later. With a movie tho......maybe we'll finally get dome confirmation thriugh this medium
All I know is I'm happy it has the OG animatronics I miss foxy
When you say that the trailers hide important information about the movie, I think the animatronics wanting to turn Abby into them it's one the cases. The animatronics are peaceful when near children but agressive towards adults, so the possible outcome is that there is going to be a huge misunderstanding about that sentence of turning Abby into an animatronic when they could be trying to protect her knowing that Spring Bonnie/William Afton in the restaurant. I don't know if it's fitting or not
All I know is I'm happy it has the OG animatronics I miss foxy
It was inevitable
I always had the idea that the cupcake was possessed by Susie's dog, cause William killed it in the pizzeria to lure her in
my brother in christ. it hasnt come out yet
What if, hear me out? What if when the purple Guy got arrested and bust out of jail, he change his name so we can apply for a job being that he’s gonna be the same person, but different name and easier jobs
But matpat The child has a striped shirt? Don't you think that means something
IT'S ME
Since William and Mike are known for having aliases in the lore. I'm thinking that Mike and Abbys parents, are actually just their foster parents. 🤷🏾‍♂ Maybe Abbys named was changed because she was younger and William could've been abusive, so they were taken away. We never see Mike and William in the same scene, he just calls him up. That would be good and really sinister honestly..
I would love to see a "FNAF week" across all the channels
Bro i remember wearing that cursed Freddy costume for Halloween and i still have it 😭😭😭
JOSH HUTCHERSON bet Imma need to watch it
Tryhardninja called it, it was all the cupcake
You mean Yellow bear
Play pals cameo!
15:04 what about him being the crying child? He even has the stripped shirt
But there's golden Freddy right there! With golden hat duh! I see all 4 others too! Jee whatever he will see what been shouting for a while in the actual movie..
Honestly waiting for this to die out
5:11 the first time anyone has thought positively about nebraska
The movie isnt even out yet how big is this man's brain?
if mike is michael garret is crying child steve is william abby is elizabeth right...?
I love This theory but I believe that the 5th kid is golden Freddy because like you said golden Freddy  has two  souls
I think the kid who matpat thinks is cupcake ( 14:55 )I think he’s crying child. I meant, look at the kids outfit and the crying child’s outfit, there the same
Why is the FNAF movie releasing on the same day as 1989 Taylor's Version????
Ehh…
Dude, the movie hasn’t even come out yet  Calm tf down
OH man I can't believe Matpat time traveled to make this video, the movie isn't even out yet for me
I really hope my hometown cinema has the movie when it comes out cause they didn’t have ‘talk to me’ which is literally a movie made by ppl in our country 😭😭
Matpat I have a idea how about A FNAF WEEK ON ALL OF YOUR CHANNELS so what do you think 100 likes on this comment and he might do it
It make sense that the kid is the cupcake because his shirt looks like the wrapping of the cupcake
The movie will end with him screaming in agony
I'm going to say non-canon
Uhm actually Baby first appeared in Fnaf World ☝️🤓
You know Matpat at is big when google sponsors them.
I honestly think Matpat is probably the most insane big Youtuber out there, and I love him so much for it.
bro has made the same video title so many times at this point
Ain’t no way google sponsored this video
Sponsoring a portion? Does that just mean it doesn't pay for the production but does chip in and help pay Or is it actually like it fully pays for a specific part of a video I've never heard someone say it like that so I don't know
You never sease to brighten my dad while I have The Vid if you know what I mean.
just noticed bonnie is blue
dude it didn'tt even come out yet
all games until fnaf 2😭
The fifth kid might be the puppet
Dawg it aint even out yet
bro it's not out yet. CHILL OUT ON FNAF
THE MOVIE DIDNT EVEN COME OUT YET
Fun fact: oct 28th is my birthday best present ever
The fifth child not linked to an animatronic is wearing the crying child’s clothes
I want film theory to make a video on how much a Wonka bar cost, I really want to know
YESSSS I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
The fith kid has a striped shirt, crying child?
the more i realize the more that i really start to think that the ending is 100 percent correct every blumhouse movie involves friendship family or a good ending ( insidious 1 2 3 and 4 IT etc etc ) so it would make sense if that were true
Matpat prob solved the movie cause he wasn’t in it😢  Edit: nvm💀
Thanks to Google MEAT for sponsoring a PORTION of this video. In 10 years this comment will be hilariously, terrifyingly relevant.
The first "Solved" for the Movie...
But the striped shirt is more in line for the puppet
Not the G  O  O  G  L  E    M  E  E  T
The moment things become live action the series dies every time and now this is going to die as well
Oh I’m sorry the kid in the long sleeve striped shirt is supposed to be the cupcake? And not a certain puppet?
tell me why i saw the title immediately gasped and went “no you didn’t” and clicked then spent so long having a crisis that i fell for the clickbaity title i follow the channel i follow all the channels i should be used to this
6:54 I bet they made walls specifically for the trailers just so that they didn't give away their secrets before the movie actually comes out
I'm at 7:28, but right before you explain it, I can explain it by saying that in the books, Afton gives himself a fake name, so it wouldn't be surprising for him to do the same in the movie edit: CALLED IT!
Maybe William put Michael in the suit
"Uprle man" God the amount of times that his name has came up, urple was never how I thought I'd hear it it threw me off 🤣🤣 (7:03)
I’m quite surprised that people don’t talk about how well this movie fits with the fnaf 3 mini-games  Let’s see...  Worn-out Springbonnie  William afton alive  Michael before fnaf sl (this was revealed recently)  The pizzeria of the first game Abandoned   I believe that Michael in one way or another will want to help souls and in a desperate attempt, he will dismantle the animatronics.  If you look at this it fits perfectly with the minigames since, technically speaking mike is a man in purple, he is confused with william in his own words during the first game, in addition to maybe this confirms that in that dialogue of fnaf sl when michael mentions having released them, he does not refer to the fire of fnaf 3, he refers to the minigames of this, in that course of fnaf 1 to fnaf 3, he was the one who dismantled them or the one who attracted them, being represented perhaps as purple freddy.  In addition, this also fits with the fact that William asked Mike to release them, he had to be alive for this and not locked in the safe room, as we see in the movie.
IS THAT THE BITE OF 87! 1:14
This is gonna be like the Godzilla vs Kong theory. He predicted the whole thing. Basically
with gtnotlive its way over 100+ videos on fnaf
Theorize about those glamrock costumes. The suits used in the movie? The night guard outfit.
I 100% agree the fifth kid is the cupcake because a) it's eyes glow on the poster, b) it moves on its own, and c) we technically see six kids all together in the trailers- thus, one of them has to go somewhere.
The movie comes out on my bday
Girls 😉🤍
The striped shirt doesnt make you think puppet?
bro its not even out yet 💀
day 15 of asking matpat to watch An Undeniably Canon Five Nights at Freddy's Timeline by the ooftroop.
you need to cover the walking dead and the civic republic military again because things have gotten more interesting
I think (maybe I have no solid proof) that mikes brother is Afton.
Bros giving spoilers before the movie releases 💀💀💀
I learned about it only a year ago
17:33-17:44 that’s exactly what I was thinking about
Sorry but Google needs to rename Google Meet, any time it's mentioned I only hear "Google Meat" and it brings to mind a strange dystopian future..
Yes the cupcake
Is anyone going to point out that child matpat said was the cupcake was wearing a stripped shirt?
the kid has a striped shirt... and so does the crying child, what cupcake noooooo (sobs)
HEADS UP FLIM THEORY if you guys did not already think about this what if the young mike character puts garret in Fred bears mouth and gives him "A kiss" but as we see in the trailer he's taken away in a car? but its common sense not to drive a car in a random forest with not trails or any thing to guide them and sense the kids are dead how are they in the forest? its probably a dream or his imagination or he's getting haunted by them but then why did he not chase the car with his little brother inside? what im thinking what happened was he had a nightmare about how he killed his little brother and how he's gone now and now he's hearing about these kids who got murdered? but its just a theory A ME THEORY!
I know you’ve probably done more research than me but I always just thought that the thing going towards the dudes face was a Anamatronic head that was taken off it’s endo skeleton and that those sharp spinning things are just the gears that would control the mouth and other movements in the head but they are just being used in this case as a way to take someone’s face off lol
end of AD 11:09 you're all welcome lol
Stripes on the kids shirt. There are 2 key characters I can think of with stripes like that. Crying child, and puppet
Ar ar ar ar ar arg
The shirt. It matches the marionette???
(breathing) FIVE NIGHTS A-
THE CUPCAKEIS A CHILD AND IT MAKES SENSE SINCE THE KID HAS STRIPES ON HIS SHIRT
I love how Mattpat is making theories about the FNaF movie before it’s even released
"WE ARE GOING TO SOLVE FNAF!" This is like your 6th time "solving FNAF" 😂
Let's be real Markiplier started the FNAF trend, who agrees with me? 👇
Now I want to see this movie, not just because I’m interested despite not having played any of the games, but also because I want to see if any of MatPat’s predictions actually hold up.   He has had a bad track record of making predictions of movie plots before they come out, which ultimately prove to be false.  Rogue One, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, The Last Jedi, Frozen II…I can keep going.  Edit: I just got back from seeing the movie, and he actually got most of the plot down, except the ending, which he still got wrong.
Scott's master plan:To affect all of matpats channels with fnaf
What about the puppet?  That animatronic was a huge part of the series, too, so I don't think they would forget it.
"Mike will do anything for cash" ANYTHING?
16:32 what if it is a flashback Mike has and the ghosts put a twist on it and appear in the flashback?
Soooooo, you aren’t phone guy, or literally anything in the movie :(
WOOOOOOOO🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
6:50 Is that Darwin from TAWoG?
I’ve been waiting years for this,
Fun fact: the fnaf movie is coming out on my birthday
I think the extra kid is the crying child he has the same striped shirt
10:38
Am I early?
OR the kid with the tripped shirt and jeans can be the kid that william killed it could be his brother
Puppet ghost @-@ That’s my theory for the blond kid with the striped shirt
Kids can't fit in a robot cup cake MatPat.
I have one question are you Are you in the five nights at Freddy’s movie? Tell me are you or are you not in the biggest horror movie of the year FNAF movie
Oh... I hate the idea that some kid is trapped in the cupcake but... look at the poster the cupcake has glowing eyes... I like the idea of GF being the brother but... come on put that fifth kid somewhere else... ANYWHERE else...
Hard times merica f
Fnaf has invaded film theory now all we need is a Freddy fazbear themed restaurant and clothing brand
13:41 "let's just hope she doesn't time travel" don't worry, I know a certified crazy guy who knows enough about time travel to have built a time machine out of a DeLorean in the mid-80s. he knows how to deal with this.
It ain’t even released yet and he already solved it😭😭
hahahahha fnaf has taken over this channel now
Now we need fnaf food and clothes for the remaining channels  IT HAS HAPPENED, FNAF IS IN FILM THEORY
🆗
That's SpringBonnie Afton doesn't become SpringTrap until he gets springlocked😅😂😊.
Day 28 of asking matpat to make a theory on emesis blue
peeta mallark is in Fnaf? crossover confirmed? possible capitol animatronic??
Random fifth kid is the actual ringleader, one of the bite victims
What if the cupcake is Chika’s dog’s ghost
that kid coud be the crying child
Matt being sponsored by Google meats 🤤🤤🤤 I hope there's pork chops  Oh wait, you're telling me it's meets, not meats? But I'm so hungry and got like 2 hours left in my shift still 😭
FANF?!?!
Hey mattpat, hear me out. What if golden freddy is the main character. What if he lost, got put in a suit, and him and afton have a mech fight where he gets damaged and him and abby leave together? What if the taxi is the last part of the movie? Otherwise where are her and golden freddy coming back from? They seem to be standing in front of freddys as if to say goodbye or like a moment to breathe after what has just happened.
har, har har har har har har har har har
MATPAT U NEED TO CHILL JUST WAIT TILL ITS OUT.😢 lemme watch it first😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Golden Freddy has a blue eye because he's Sans from Undertale. /s
I love this theory but the part where the 5th kid is theorized to be the cupcake doesn’t really work for me, with his stripped shirt I was thinking something along the lines of the puppet where maybe it’s what started the dream sequence
REMNANT?!?!
No early releases to ruin prediction theory is this time Scott!!!!!
Well I’m not sure if yellow bear aka golden Freddy is a girl or a boy
The new fnaf movie is bigger than the second coming of Christ
Matpat failed to predict a star wars movie weeks before release.   He successfully predicted a star wars movie weeks before release.   Then, he correctly predicted the joker movie a couple months before release.  He predicted the Batman movie a year before release.  Now he's predicting the fnaf movie a thousand years before release.  His powers are expanding at an exponential rate. Soon, he will predict the seventeenth coming of christ a million years before release.
The movie isn’t even out yet..
I swear if they don’t say har har har har har in the 1st three seconds of the movie!
Don’t worry mat I’ve not only fixed your timeline on my channel almost breaking me I still am hoping for what you said that it’s a different timeline other wise we are dealing with the time travel ball pit theory where we put afton in an infinite loop eventually trying to beat the series’s newest villain the copycat robot thing
18:19 This is kind of like what happened in The Twisted Ones. Charlie gets killed by Twisted Freddy when they have just managed to defeat Afton.
why in the meted avowed of Georgia did google meet sponsor this
It’s not the cupcake…
Maybe Venessa’s speech shouldn’t be taken literally. “They want to make her… like them” could possibly mean that they just want Abby to like them.
I could be completely wrong, but I thought the thing in the trailer with the spinning parts was an animatronic head, especially since in the first game they made a huge detail of "That wouldn't be so bad, if the suits themselves weren't stuffed with crossbeams, wires and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area..." and we all know quite well that Hollywood likes to play things up for drama, scares, and tension.
Bro it isnt wven out yet
Dawg the movie hasn’t even come out yet 💀😭
MATTHEW PATTHEW JUST WAIT THE MONTH
Chicas cupcake is possed by susies dog
if the movie doesnt have some crazy person yelling about how they "solved the murders of 1985" or "i found out where both of the fnaf  company's 2 owners are!" or something i will be mad
I think the 5th kid might be puppet, the shirt matches puppet
bro got sponsored by google meet? 💀
I think the mystery kid may be Charlie because of the stripped shirt.
thats what he alway say " ill solve it before it comes out "
Mat Pat solved the Fnaf movie before it is even out, congrats
BROTHER. HASN'T EVEN COME OUT YET. GET SOME SLEEP, PLS
Ever since I saw the trailer I had this thought that maybe the movies are showing what actually happened, since tape girl said games were made to cover up the real incident.
The fifth kid looks exactly like that image of Cassidy though
So William stuffed a kid inside the cupcake.
I thought the 5 child would be the puppet, his shirt does have stripes on it.
Perhaps Afton is the father of the boy he "kidnapped" but to Mike it's a mystery because the mother didn't want to admit the truth.
Nice
I want matpat to have a cameo
matpat went from ruining childhoods to spoiling movies
Please do a bonelab theory
You know matpat has gone insane when he is sponsored by Google Meet
I ain't watching this until after
I thought the 5th child would the crying child because of his striped shirt just like in fnaf 4
Would the stripy kid not just be puppet?
Ah yes, Mike's brother being Golden Freddy. So surprising! Who would've guessed?
My friends could see  2:50 to 2:59 and say "what is remnant?" while im over here understanding everthing Edit: I feel bad for mat, 10 years and still haven't completed the timeline
yeah this is correct
I personally think that Mike is going to become golden Freddy and Vanessa will be working for William afton
Nuh uh.
You know what? This additional kid looks A LOT like vengeful spirit. Please don't tell me vengeful spirit is Cupcake
annoying orange
MAT PAT   THE KID IS THE PUPPET
I knew this would come. As soon as Footofaferret posted that video, I KNEW MatPat would do a lore video 😂 thanks MatPat
What’re the chances that mikes brother is in golden Freddy and Abby is going to be protected by him, only to ultimately end up joining him as co-inhabitants of the golden Freddy costume? Idk that sounds like a pretty decent story line to me lol
Honestly I thought this game would end with Peta stuffed in the Freddie suit. It didn’t make sense for the suit to be traveling outside the restaurant otherwise
Why MatPat wasn’t invited to the film set:
If you realize golden Freddy has an end of skeleton that's how we can move and walk around but in the games he does not have an indoor skeleton it's a good thought to keep in mind
What we see: a new normal indie game. What matpat sees: LOOOOOOOOORE! What we see: a new mascot for McDonald’s. What matpat sees: LOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE! What we see: a steak. What matpat sees: LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOREEEEEEEEE!!!
0:14 hey that’s my birthday!
_Scott re-shooting the entire ending just to avoid this_
“I solve the fnaf movie.” That’s nice grandpa, now let’s get you to bed.
Bro how it hasn't came out yet
THEY’VE INFILTRATED FILM THEORU NOW
@15:16 isn't that the crying child of 83?
Disappointed that this wasn't a 2 hours long video :(
I still say the "remnant extractor" is just the movie more viscerally showing us why you don't want to be stuffed into an animatronic suit FNAF 1 style. There are moving parts in there.
Could you have done it after?
I'm giving this a 👎 because you did it when the movie did not came out...
I believe we’ve known that the cupcake can act separate since the fourth game, if you ignore Chica for too long, she’ll send him after you.
Vannesa Really watch your FNAF Timeline 😂
The 5th kid is the puppet
All of that is obvious. Why they said "rosebud" before they died.
If it weren't for you Matt I'd never know about FNAF. Your channels are the only FNAF content I get.
Literally in the fourth closet their remnant gets infected I the funtimes but their souls are still hanging out with William. They can separate
Did you guys ever formacao that in The Bite of 87 and on October 27th I'm not sound familiar to it's like Lily because it doesn't go up to 80 goes up to 31 or 30 they both end with the 30 so that's what they try to do I don't know if you guys ever knew that yeah
Bro chill the movie isnt even out💀
Couldn't the kid with no characteristics simply be the crying child. I mean he's wearing a striped shirt 🤔🤔🤔
If you commit multiple murders in the 80s and never got caught you would change your name to
Nooo. We solved the games, not the movies MATPAT nooooooo
mat I have figured it out Abby has to be either baby or puppet!!! But hey it's just a theory
Honestly if I was a horror creator I would be terrified of MatPat. He’d figure out my hidden end game before I even have a chance to reveal it
just make fnaf theory at this point.
1:16  fine my secret is I am a Bendy fan
Last kid shadow freddy
Mat never thought the day whould come where FNAF was on flim theory.
Is it possible that the kid in the top hat is Golden Freddy and the kid in the brown striped shirt is Freddy?
pov its been years and you still get excited at a new fnaf video
XD
I was happy to go to chuckie cheeses when I was a kid so I might see this movie if the reviews are good. You have to wonder why they made the villan an older person cause in the game it seems like Afton is mid to late 40s and this guy looks early to mid 50s it would be intresting if your sequal theory is somewhat right maybe do another video when the movie is out streaming and you saw it.
My big guess is the 5th kid is the puppet due to the puppet stripes and his striped shirt
I thank that you are one of the smartest people on YouTube but I think your wrong on this one but it is just a theory of course
Some people think that the sceen with fredy and the 2 kids is a red hering and that its not usable for evidance but thw kid that leads the girl to fredy is the kid that matpat thinks will be the cupcake 🧁, maybe its a supepr flaash back
I knew it would happen one day, I just had hope it wouldn't happen so soon.
okoo
okoo
It's not a "Springtrap" costume. Springtrap is what we call him when he's undead inside the suit. It's just William wearing the Springbonnie suit
I want, I want, with all my heart, to see the springlock failure at the end of the movie.
Couldnt that "remnant extractor" just be a scooper?
Bro the movie hasn't even come out yet💀
oh no, now you've spoiled the fnaf movie for me! I'm so mad tho that they're mashing everything together for the movie and creating some kinda separate lore again.
Imagine being so important you get sponsored by Google Meet
Prediction: This is going to be a dumb video made to ride the hype train for views  Result: Yeah pretty much, it's kinda pointless when we will literally see the movie shortly
Hey don't yell at me don't hate me but if the kid that mat pat thought it was cupcake hey what happens if it was the puppet cause strips I don't know just a idea
What I discovered is that Vanessa stands exactly like that lady in the advertisement clip pushing the button. As if she herself worked there before and knew how the entertainers and waiters started the show?
I will never forgive you, Matt. Pat, you made a food fairy and a fashion theory. Before you made a book theory, you must not care for the educated People on your channel.💔
Oh god has it really been 10 years since fnaf took off? God i feel old :(
Unbroken Springtrap? Golden Fredbear? Matt, I love your videos but, are you okay my guy?
Vandals break in to destroy the pizzeria  Animatronics: you've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?  Vandals: *dies*
You should make a video in fashion theory where how the people wearing the spring lock suits got affected
may be controversial but I'm kind of glad mat didn't get into the movie because if he did then he would know the lore of it and he wouldn't have been able to make this video. all that aside I still wish he was in the movie even as like the main detective who is trying to solve the murders and everything, and that being said, mat thank you for all of your theories and all of your videos they have helped me through so much so again thank you.
lol imagine if there was a "Michael, dont leave me hear" reference
Oh my God matpat solves fnaf again
There is the possibility that the cupcake is Susie's dog. I believe susie possesses Chica in the lore and her dog also dies in Fruity Maze. It would explain the way the cupcake is attacking the robber as well. He also has a midnight motorist shirt on, Fruity maze's sister game in Pizza sim. It's a stretch, but also "a theory".
I'ts coming out on my birthday! :D
Chill out man the movie isnt even out yet
Plot Twist: He didn't solve anything.
I thought that machine thing was a scooper
this means that’s not the real mike
I disagree to be honest!
The MatPat jumpscare scared me more than any other FNAF content in years
8:15 Some evil dirt bag with a chainsaw?
Bro don’t spoil the movie it ain’t even out 😂
I think Matt is right about the middle child not being golden Freddy but I think it’s possible for him to be the puppet based on the striped shirt based on them trying to combine eras.
Do a theory on hey duggee
The 5th kid seems to be wearing a striped shirt, just like the Crying Child, aka Mike’s brother, so it seems reasonable enough
Thanks Matthew, and thank you. Scott Cawthon.
At long last, fnaf has made it to film theory and film in general !
I would be devastated if most of the videos have been false😂
Let's just be happy it'll probably take several movies before we've got anything particularly crazy to deal with.
Denmark 🇩🇰
I love the idea of video game movies just setting up a different universe that's still based on the franchise rather than basing the movie in the same universe from the established lore. Sonic did it, Mario did it, and now FNAF did.  This isn't really game changing but it's a neat detail I wanted to point out.
nuh uh
Finally FNAF gets a video on film theory
im getting tired of all the fnaf...so many awesome games and movies...and its all fnaf or arg's...*sigh*
2:34 That thing looks like a "Freddy Fazbear" head to me, just with the wires and mechanical bits exposed. it looks to me like The Freddy head is being placed onto Mike in an attempt to put him into a suit, mirroring the "they might think you're an endoskeleton out of costume" bit from the original game. Those Blades we see spinning around might just be really, REALLY unsafe gears running the mechanical bits of the animatronic.
BRUH I THINK HE IS THE VRYING CHILED
HE IS A DAAAD?!!!
making a theory about the fnaf movie is like going back to square one.
Yo matpat I literally new this would come ut
15:28 *Spoilers Ahead*   So you're telling me, that Mr William over here managed to fit an entire body, in a cupcake?  No way that striped... shirt... kid will... Wait a minute
Mat, you are one of my favourite creators.  But PLEASE wait until the movie comes out before trying to solve it! Calm your theorist instincts!
Bro matpat put warning there are spoilers
Can you make a theory video on this channel called @brandonworks6443
Vanessa is a cop that moonlights as a security guard
What if the 5th kid is the puppet? The kid does have a striped shirt, might be a clue.
The 5th kid instantly reminded me of the Puppet because of the stripes
What if that was a close up view of the scooper
Google Meat would be a fun sponsor for food theory
Matpat is the true king of Yapping
lowkey they should release an offical store of all the in game merch, the fnaf plushies, toys, lunchboxes and the plushies and shirts and sweaters from security breach, it would be a big sucess. id die for the roxxane wolf sweater from sb
Bro solved a movie before it was even out
I want the movie to end with a springlock suit failure.
Leave it to Matpat to solve a movie 1 month before it is released 😎
Ah yes, Google meet sponsoring a video about animatronics killing kids in the 80's
I almost feel like the script writers saw my old “the cupcake is my friend, the cupcake will not harm me” comments on various vids back when the series was new and went “haha, nope!”
Now go solve the game ho
I'm sorry your not in it (idk if you actually are)
FNAF theories couldn't be contained in the Game Theory channel alone. It has already spread to the Film Theory channel!
matpat just ruined their movie lol
Why does everyone on your team have an android phone. iPhone is just better. Thanks so much for making this video!
8:15 Shaggy
hey matpat, can you make a film theory about the movie “When the wind blows”
Whoa. Pita didnt do so good after the Hunger Games.
Crying child
I DIDNT EVEN COME OUT YET
mf it didnt even come out yet 😭
15:06 the stripped shirt makes me think its C.C
AAAUUUGGGHHH NO U DID NOT
I knew the theorist channels weren’t gone let the fnaf movie breath, movie ain’t even out yet but still make the claim “WE SOLVED IT” I beat that they will already be done solving the 3rd movie right when the first one comes out 🤣🤣🤣
! SPOILERS FOR THE FOURTH CLOSET NOVEL !      The part about the spinning blade in the face near the beginning of the video gets me. While it's good theory, I'd say it would align more with Pg. 212 of The Fourth Closet novel. This is where Baby/Elizabeth/Fake Charlie corners Carlton and almost saw-blades his face off. The book describes this scenario and the blades really similarly to how it's depicted in the trailer. Just a thought. Anyway, love your vids as always!
matpat, please stop time traveling, you'll delay another release
It needs to come out sooner to keep the solve it before it comes out then immediately comes out.
I don’t think the fifth kid is cupcake I think it’s actually the puppet. Because the stripes on the shirt.
I figured it was mike in the suit and the dream stuff was just cause he's dead and able to connect ot the kids. Then again i'm not a super smart theoristy type of person
I've never played or watched gameplay of FNAF, I just wasn't interested. I do wanna watch Mattpat break it down though
Hopefully if the baby theory is correct, we’ll get to see a live action version of Ennard, who is a perfect character for a horror movie
So the sequel won't be fnaf 2's story?🥺  Aw man ;-;   I was hoping to Withered Freddy there ;-;
Hi
7:58 The amount of research that went into confirming this detail is very funny to me.
Matt is crazy he found a clue in a instagram comment 🤯
Matpat later I SOLVED THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST
I can't wait to hear William scream "ZOINKS!" As he gets spronglocked.
Maybe you should do a Theory of the Halo TV Series. As a Halo fan I'm just disappointed of Halo Series.
fie nighst at fredsy
I totally thought Mat Pat was going to say the Abby was a robot.
Is the FNAF movie going to be in NETFLIX?
Amen Brother
What if that kid who possessed the cupcake was the crying child because of the striped shirt
Great now we have to wait another year so Scott can rewrite it
Steve Ragland could also be the phone guy who has the same voice in FNAF 1 2 and 3 so you'd expect him to be the character in, oh would you look at that, 3 movies. He also seems to fill the role of Phone Guy based on his hiring of Mike over, well, a phone. Finally his name may be a reference to Dayshift at Freddy's where the phone guy in the first game is canonically named Steven (though this point is far less likely) quick edit: my personal theory is that he's both phone guy and William Afton, kinda like the old theories of FNAF 1 and 2 where people speculated that phone guy was the killer
1:10 all they have to do is be on YouTube after the trending page disappeared 🤔  Then fall into a niche
Mmmmmm Google Meat lol.
Matpat in fnaf movie 2?
Matpat with all do respect, I think you’ve lost it
Now I want lillard to say “MICHAEL DON’T LEAVE ME HERE” in his shaggy voice or something
For real tho
Nebraska is the best mid western state! Come to Nebraska!
They have to springlock Afton
im getting that fnaf cookbook i dont care anymore i just want some sodaroni and fizzy faz
time to also wait to see what they do with puppet in the 2nd movie if they dont appear in this one.
Bro really wants to spoil the movie instead of letting us see it 💀
My guy solved it before it was even released😭😭
mat pat
0:00 bro I remember being 8 or 7 and secretly using google meet to chat with my friends and…draw…questionable things. Good times.
I met Matthew Lilard he told me he is playing Afton
shots at game theory💀
You guys get the wildest sponsors... not even Linus Tech Tips get these sponsors... or they just don't take them 💀
Ladies and gentlemen. It's official: the fnaf movie  WILL have a springlock scene   Bad news is that means that there won't be a bite of 83 scene :(
Bro, the kid accidentally spoiled a movie and MatPat here spilled it to a big audience.
It's not possible that Scott forgot to put MatPat in the movie. Not even to appear in a frame like Dawko...  Matthew Robert Patrick, are you hiding something that your fans don't know?
Ah yes, we always knew this day would come
i wonder how many people got the joke at 13:39
Me when he says he's gonna solve it wait huh really 2:11
the similarities between this and our movie is insane
Fnaf, on film theory??!?
I knew this video was gonna come soon...
They aren’t going to explain the cupcake in the movie. But it Susie’s Dog.
I really don't get the part about the 5th kid being cupcake. He's wearing brown and the one in the hat is wearing light colors. Logically that has to make him Freddy whilst top hat kid is Golden Freddy.
5th kid was wearing a striped shirt with striped sleeves. The Puppet has steiped sleeves. Yeah, they show us the main 4 animatronics, but they also show Springtrap, who i think didnt appear until the 3rd game if i remember right. Puppet first appeared in 2. Puppet was important in 3, might be important in movie as well and the trailers are leaving it out for surprise. Like, maybe leading the others (this child was standing farther up then the others, i think)
The 6th kids shirt is striped I think he's the crying child somehow
Petition for jynxsi to 1v1 Marley
Because of your scary jump scare intros, I’m now use to watching horror movies with my friends. Ty❤
i laughed so hard when he said the blond kid was the cupcake
What if Mike is Michael since Abby is basically identical to Baby also he has a little brother who might’ve died like how Michael’s little brother did also Mike is almost like Michael and Michael is a security guy just like Mike
Bro that kid is the crying child look at his outfit
I was At my school book fair and I saw the fnaf cook book it was just there I didn’t know it was unreleased
Mat Pat really made an theory video abt the FNAF movie that hasn't even been released yet
60+ FNAF videos?!! Wow can't believe i have seen them all throughout these years.
MatPat: Its been so long... Me: Its been so long, since i seen my son...
I Got Google Meet
ITS INFECTING ALL OF US got me cracking. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
15:16 this kid has a striped shirt 🤔
"This series exploded about a decade ago"   _I instantly aged into an old man hearing that_
Wow…thanks for the spoilers.
✨️✨️✨️✨️✨️
There's a joke here drawing a comparison between the scene from this movie and Cabinet Man
I need in this movie for some one SOMEWHERE say "its just a theory"
show me a texan who doesn't have the flag or siloet of the state somewhere in their house or office lol
Of course it’s doesn’t have a happy ending it. FNAF movie
That child was warning a striped shirt and blue pants
I think the most ridiculous part of this theory is that anyone would ever want to go to Nebraska
As soon as I read the title, I instantly burst out laughing no way this is gonna last long😂😂😂😂
Man bro is so into the lore he figured out the movie before it came out
The end is gonna be like this: Afton chases vanessa and mike around the building, deactivating each of the animatronics along the way. then the spirits come out and the second twist (first one being career guy is afton) is that afton gets springlocked and then vanessa and mike go their seperate ways. Fnaf 2 (LA) will take place during 2023, so basically fnaf 3. Fnaf 3 (LA) will either be Fnaf 5 or 6, i dont think 4 would happen because i doubt garett is ethan. Then fnaf 3 (LA) will end with the henry speech, and that horror movie thing where everyone who survived does the classic horror movie end thing  Bonus theory: the career guy is actually henry and afton is just snooping around the fnaf 1 building unbeknownst to henry
Matty boy…     Spring lock failure? 🙏🙏🙏
I already have Google meet. Sorry I can’t download it because I already have it downloaded
When he said it exploded a decade ago that hurt me emotionally
Ceaseless torment, sounds like a certain fnaf story to me lol. The one where Funtime Freddy would talk about all of these medieval execution techniques to the person encased in him.
Can’t wait for the style theory on Springlock suits
i have never played a single fnaf game in my life but i have followed the entire franchise from the very beginning since fnaf 1 came out when i was 10 and watched every single fnaf theory video as they came out. Its actually wild that I am almost 20 years old and I am STILL watching every single fnaf game theory, as well as every other fnaf theorist and gamer out there like mark, fuhnaff, dawko, spiff, etc.. And STILL i have never once played a single one of those games.
Bro you gotta stop
I legitimately didn’t know about Undertale nor FNAF until 2017. I only learned about FNAF because my cousin loved it that much.
2:14 where have i head that before
Day 8 of asking Mat Pat o to make a theory about divergent
Welcome To Freddy’s
Yo dude fang help wanted is way scarier
Counterpoint on the last boy in the woods. He had a striped shirt. Could be a crying child. XD
Looks like I don't need to watch the movie anymore
matpats best arc yet:
the cupcake being possessed by a separate soul would really just ruin my immersion. like seriously? I was actually hoping that child to be the puppet!! the stripes have a small parallel to the marionette, since it's not quite the right style, but it would have been much cooler!    I was really hoping they'd lean more into the uncanny horror that the first games really prided themselves on, but it seems it's going to be quite different. Fingers crossed the tone works for it though!
let’s be honest, if anyone thinks it will have a happy ending before or after the theory they probably haven’t played fnaf much, let alone know the lore
They didn’t put Matpat in the movie so he had to even the scoreboard 💀
Mike so-called "Dad" could be the stepdad Mike Mom left William Afton probably divorce
MATPAT I SWEAR IF YOU JUST INDIRECTLY SPOILED THE ENDING OF MOVIE
I think it would be cool if there was a movie series about fnaf where it’s the whole lore timeline. Idk if that’s just me but 🤷‍♀️
You should consider this Film Theory: The Incredible Lie! Violet is now the child of Mr and Mrs Incredible as she has no physical traits that relate to them and her powers don't even seem to match or relate unlike Dash's, in fact she might be the child of Edna Mode whom the Incredibles took in after Violet's father died and Edna decided she didn't want to be a mother in her grief. Second part to the theory, Jack Jack isn't their child either and instead is the result of the government's secret project to mass produce Supers. With Supers not being all that numerous and potentially the birth rate between Supers being low, the government decided to make their own and thus experimented with orphans, giving them DNA of multiple Supers in hopes to replicate their powers if not create new powers, however with results not being as they wished and the ban on Supers the program got shut down, Jack Jack being one of these babies makes a lot of sense as it would explain the multiple powers he seems to have as well as why the Incredibles were insistent that Jack Jack had no powers, because the government ruled him a failed experiment and sent him to a Super Family in order to cover up what actually happened.  I know this theory sounds really out there but the more I think about it the more it makes sense and I'd love it if you could look into this more and see if there are any details I'm missing that can further support this theory or put it to rest.
The movie could have been worse if the animatronics were not possesed at all, like they were just maltfunctioning and that would be horrible its a good thing they kept going with the original lore.  Question for matpat: can you and markiplier collab in fnaf vr 2?
0:49 “fnaf fashion line”  Cloak, (who partnered directly with fnaf, likely well before fnaf ever did their own clothes thing):  **nervous sweating**
matthew the movies not out yet how did you already do it
Other then mat pats side of the franchise I've done a great job avoiding fnaf lol and yea I would fully avoid it but I wanna support matpat so I watch or at least hear it lol you got this yes I don't post often I like lurking weather it's streams or watching anything I tend to keep comments to myself but yea I'm very good at avoiding content if I don't wanna see or if wanna be blind to the game later on lol
I still think it’s weird that  1989 tv is being Released the same day as the fnaf movie
i think the remnent  machine is a animatronic head because the other side appears to have a mouth
The kid has a striped shirt put two and two together
The movie to me feels like the One Piece Live Action, it'll just take the important parts and mix it in with some reference to the original.
Hype for Steve Raglan!! 🎉 Woohoo 🙌
I want a pet theory channel
It'd be pretty cool if you did something with the idea of each theory channel fighting for control.
JUST WAIT UNTIL THE MOVIE COMES OUT
bro predicted it before it came out
Lore
MY BROTHER IN CHRIST THE MOVIE ISN'T OUT YET WHAT HAVE YOU SOLVED
matpat never fails to make my toes wiggle
That intro just made me think matpat has like separate personalities for each theory channel. While at least food and game theory have covered something FNAF related. I think fashion theory might have as well, but I could be wrong. Film theory hasn’t had that same chance. That is until now, and all this time waiting. The personality in charge of film theory had to wait and watch the others have their chance talking about FNAF. Especially the main personality over at game theory. But now it’s finally his turn and the intro was his unbridled joy, anger, sadness, jealousy and rage all coming out. *”But hey, that’s just a theory. A Film theory”*
Okay. Ignoring the fact MatPat finally made a theory on the FNAF movie, if I had a nickel for every time MatPat was sponsored by Google, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice, right?
Only Matpat could come up with a video saying he's solved a movie before it's even come out yet.
im betting abby lives through the whole movie, but at the end takes a doll from the prize counter and one of the last shots is of the dolls eyes faintly glowing as abby snuggles with it or smth
Lore lore lore I love lore
I also thought the 5th kid was the cupcake after seeing the trailer and all the posters showing 5 animatronics (Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy and the Cupcake) so I think that's right. They probably have made Mike's Brother (Crying Child) into Golden Freddy
Is that the bite of 86!?
What im looking forward to the most in this movie is when freddy pops out and says "its freddin time" and freds everywhere
FNAF?! On FILEM THEROY?! I don’t think so
The movie BETTER end with Afton getting springlocked or I rage
15:18 What if stripes kid is the Puppet? Could be 4D chess, but introducing it would make sense what he’s wearing stripes and maybe he’s the first victim
i might be trippen or is that 5th kid the spitting image of Cassidy?
But on the scene with the kids in the forest, I always thought that the golden freddy kid (now cupcake kid) was a reference to the crying child <.< you know, because of the stripped shirt
AYOOO NEBRASKA REP BABY LETS GOOOOOO
The fifth kid could be the marionette given his stripped clothing…
Matpat acting like Matthew lillard wasn’t already confirmed to be Afton before the trailers
This counts as a birthday gift. The movie comes out on my bday so thank you MatPat
I only used Samsung Google meets best
🎶Ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar🎶🐻🦊🐥🐰
Mat you are really hung up on that cupcake.  I am fairly certain we have seen the cupcake attack on it's own in some of the games.
My niece and I are dressing up as Freddy and Bonnie when we go see the movie 😆
My first reaction was "dang mat chill it ain't even released yet"
My birthday is October 27🐻
How to get off "Youtube"??
I am sorry but I have to tell the truth this is the worst theory I’ve ever heard I’m sorry but it’s true for the movie at least I don’t mean to hate but It’s just a bad
Just wait until it comes out a year later just to change the plot so he's wrong 😂
Film theory idea: goosebumps or the new goosebumps show coming in October 13
the last kid has strips. that scream puppet to me.
I'm sorry a FNAF COOKBOOK!?!?!?
Okay, the movie supposedly taking place in Nebraska has to be the best detail to me.  Not because of lore implications, but because it's my Home State.
15:05 The last kid is wearing stripes, which could be a nod to the Puppet.
Mike becomes Freddy you see him get scooped before they show freddy and the 5th kid is the Puppet... geez you missed something.
Can't wait for the end credits scene being a police officer asking, "What couldn've happened here?" Followed by MatPat on lone chair saying "I don't know, but I have a theory"
nope no spoilers
The 5th kid could be the crying child due to the shirt
He said he’s been doing this for a decade and yet he still says that’s just a theory
Didnt expect this,but im not surpised tbh
14:57 the kid with top hat is golden fred and the kid in the BROWN SHIRT is regular fred
I think Mike and "Steve" having the opposite colored ties and rooms is a detail that should be brought up.
It feels like yesterday when mat was still theorising more on who purple guy was and who the 6 kids were but now look at this sister location , security breach and now a movie how times have changed and grown
Actually if u die in fnaf ur inside a freddy suit so maybe ur tortured in game even if we don't see it
Up
I think Mike is going to possess the Golden Freddy and end up being Abby's guardian. The cab ride at the end of the trailer will also be at the end of the movie.
I’m in Wyoming so I’m right in between Nebraska and Utah so how is my house not invaded with animatronic
Exciting!
Leave it to matpat to find the lore of something that doesn't exist
The fact that matpat can try and hide on another channel but fnaf is always gonna come back to him like a boomerang
Bro the movie ain’t even out yet 😭
please please cover tyke and sons lumber co.
The movie producers on their way to change the entire movie's plot cuz matpat is a freaking GENIUS!!!
hmm i wonder if there will be food theory and style theory on fnaf
Remember when Mat made a theory for the Mario movie and was way off?
Searching for the bodieeeeeees... Searching for the bodieeeeeees...
I think Vanessa is working with Afton and that’s why she know so much I think she was sent there to make sure Mike stays so that he can get rid of him ( I still think there’s a familial link I think William got divorced and is going after his family and Abby is mikes half sister) but over the course of the film Vanessa feels sympathetic for Mike and switches allegiance angering William in the suit who reveals they are working together and attacks her while Mike goes to look for Abby who believe is being possessed by golden Freddy and that’s why they’re always seen together  Idk just a theory
gonna come back to this after the movie comes out to see how right he is why did he get so much right
Google meet the sponsorship of the video Quickly turns into a dark voice
Congrats but who asked
Happy birthday 🎂🎁🎈🎉🎊
Love you, Mathew Patrick!
15:19 matpat that kid is missing right eye and what other animatronic is missing there right eye
i Hope puppet will also get an important role (even if its in a sequel) bcs puppet should be very important in the lore if I remember correctly
OH MY GOD NOOO MAT PAD YOU ARE GONNA MAKE SCOTT RE DO THE FILM AND WE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR
I feel like we’re going to get Williams spring lock failure at the end of the movie. Like Mat said if the animatronics do fight back I feel it’ll cause the spring lock failure on him and then they trap him in the walls and rots
ok but what if the fnaf movie has a detective it could be played by him and it would be funny
I still think that the cupcake is Susie's dog.
Honestly I wouldn't wonder if the final theory channel was just FNAF theory
April fools
matpat might get sent to a mental hospital
“ we’re going to solve it before it releases” - that one didn’t age quite so well
That cookbook was at my BOOK FAIR? And its not even OUT YET?!
Can you do a theory on OCTONAUTS the kids show it is on Netflix I believe
Finally Film Theory touches the Fnaf movie. What a crazy and ironic thing to say.  Fnaf has gotten so far now. From just a game to having its own movie credits to scott
This is the main reason why you shouldn’t say ANYTHING if ur making a FNAF movie bc Matt will solve it no matter the cost he even stalks actors to use in his lore
The 5th child could be crying child look at his shirt
bro solved it before the movie was even released
I have turned on my Film Theory notifications
The question still remains are they going to do a spring-lock scene?
I think since there trying to incorporate so much references and since Vanessa knows so much about the pizzeria I bet she will become vanny
It's kinda weird that matpat saying Film Theory than Game theory on FNAF
Bro chill, here in italy the film its not even out yet 💀💀
love ya mat but the modern generation uses discord for all that stuff
A host at Universal Studios for the Blume house theater during this fright fest said that 3 games are in the movie, with that and them saying its released to stream on Peacock then I dunno now. Sounds like they are just throwing it together.
Mat you didn't have to assault me directly by saying FNaF is a decade old c'mon man I'm not ready for that yet  Edit: Now Scott has to troll Mat directly by releasing the movie next week instead of in October like he did with FNaF 4 lmao
The FNAF movie is being released just in time for Halloween
watching this with no knowledge of fnaf must be like watching the weirdest fever dream
Ok, here are the changes that I think have occured in the timeline: William never got springlocked. Mike never got scooped. These are all the changes I can really count. Sorry if you expected more :(
I thought that the puppet stuffed the kids
ITS SPREADING!!! FNAF IS SPREADING TO ALL OF THE THEORY CHANNELS!!!!!
I have a feeling that when FNAF ends, Matpat ends
If Mikes father is supposed to be casted for a flashback than couldnt it still be William afton but younger?
Saving this for later to watch in case it is right.
Did you know that the guy who got attacked by chicas cupcake was casted as carl
It’s spring Bonnie not spring trap
Can you make a food theory where you make a Five Night At Freddy’s cookbook recipe like you did for Mountain Dew Cookbook pizza recipe? I’d be willing to make that at home for Halloween. 😊
As a Nebraska man he has got his goals set correctly. GO HUSKERS! 🌽
Matpat obviously could do this, hes in the movie hes got the script
how do you stuff a kid in a cupcake lol
Dude chill the movie ain't even come out yet
Jeez matt slow down its not even out
i wish i could time travel
Puppet -_-
That kid has a striped shirt what if he’s crying child or the puppet
Dude, stop stealing my theories without credit.  This is LITERALLY the second one given that I called the Security Guard being Mike Afton before you said it.
The cup cake is Susie‘s dog
so. you're telling us that you DONT have a cameo in the movie? you have been a very pivotal and important figure for the game since its release. are you telling us you ARE NOT in the the fnaf movie? really?
I think i’ll wait until after i watch the movie to finish this vid
Google sponsors him yet Coke still stays away. It really is an uphill battle.
Good Job!!!😀
Bros literally stalking little kids instagram accounts for a video 💀
I think that Abby is getting stuffed . And isn’t completely in as we see her next to golden Freddy, but never see mike with Abby with Vanessa in the hospital. He wouldn’t leave her due to the danger of Willy boy and the animatronics. Or I’m just overthinking it
In my mind the stripes the kid wear give off puppet but i guess not 15:04
Thank you time traveler
I feel that the 5th ghost kid is marionette due to the fact that he has a stripped shirt just like the lines of marionette
This is a really good ….help HELP HELP PLEASE IM GOING TO SAY IT HEEEELP        Har har har har har
Getting home from school and seeing this reminded me how insane and dedicated Mat is
My birthday has never come on a better day than this year, I feel accomplished
What if the kid in stripes is the Puppet?
i still think the cupcake is susie’s dog haha
I love your video’s
I am fully ready for MatPat to be completely wrong about the movie.
Don’t speculate to much matpat or else they’ll change the movie’s plot
Not even out yet and this dude solved it. Bro is playing 50D chess while we all on 2D
blud got the pre-release beta 😭
MATPAT ALREADY U ARE A MADMAN FOR FNAF   EDIT: matpat u remember the time u predicted the Mario movie ur probably gonna fail
6:31 yay
Theory Idea: How did Beetlejuice die?
Meat slots in  Tee hee
W matpat
not watched the video yet but how in tf you gonna solve a movie that hasn't even come out yet
I honestly think that mike will becomes golden Freddy does anyone else think that?
another fnaf
You should have been in the movie 😔
Sponsored by Google Meat
It’s not a cupcake it’s the puppet
not watched the video yet but how in tf you gonna solve a movie that hasn't even come out yet
So it's basically like a FNAF fanfic? As in somebody took the characters and certain events form the mainline lore and made themself an AU.
I also don't think the "troublemakers" are just troublemakers. I think they're small-scale vigilantes; maybe they're trying to keep the place from reopening. Maybe they're stalling. There is way too much anger in the destruction. At very least, Hank needs to be Henry. "Don't count out Uncle Hank just yet!"
Who else realizes that the paw patrol movie poster (old poster, new movie) looks almost exactly like the fnaf poster
My initial thought was MC is gonna die,enter Freddy’s body,and then we have the cory cameo scene with the little sister
Chill matpat the movie isn't even out yet!
If you think this movies going to have a happy ending... do you know ANYTHING about FNAF?
Freddy being friendly with a child and having blue eyes reminds me of Glamrock Freddy. It might not mean anything but it's just a little thought I had.
Hey matpat, are you ever gonna do another video on _boisvert?
I did a double take at the start because since you have food theory I heard Google Meet as Google Meat. I was like what? Since when is google entering the food business? Nope just just context influenced mishearing of at English homophone.
Why does no one else see that the whole "they want to make her like them" is most likely a misdirect to add some threat befire afton steps up? It makes more sense that the animatronics are trying to protect her from adults, and afton to be more specific, which is why she "befriends" them and the whole time the audience is meant to think they are trying to make her into an animatronic only for it to be revealed that they are the kids and didnt want her to end up like them. litterally them trying to turn her into an animatronic makes no sense because it goes against the way every possessed animatronic (minus the puppet) acts in the rest of the franchise.
did any body else notice that foxys eyes are a whole lot redder than the other animatronics
I think the random kid is Evan because he has a striped shirt.
I will never be fully settled that PEETA IS IN THE FNAF MOVIE.
is it me or does the fifth kid have the same outfit as crying child ??
I thought because the kid had a striped shirt he'd be the puppet or smth and they would hide it as like an extra surprise
male puppet ?!
Google meet??
Matpat.....  Be careful, you may have just caused Scott to forcefully reshoot the entire movie out of not wanting you to be right
Matpat relax dude, it hasn't even come out yet 💀
18:21 Abby accidentally stumbles into a clown outfit? 😂
Fnaf finally on the movie channel
I use google meet to call my friend
Nah Matthew lillard is turns out to be Ghostface innit he phones and kills off the animatronics one by one and then everyone else and that trust
I liked my own comment.
If anything I’d think that 5th kid would be the puppet because of the stripped shirt. And although we don’t see the puppet in the trailer doesn’t mean they couldn’t pop up anywhere in the movie
“If you think this has a happy ending, you haven’t been paying attention”  Did you just quote Ramsay Bolton?
Sounds to good not to be true
Matpat making a theory on FNAF on FILM Theory is the equivalent of New Game+ for most games, starting all over with the knowledge you already know
Didn’t he confirm on twitter (Matthew Lillard) that he was going to say the classic line “I always come back”. That’s pretty much confirming that he’s going to be afton?!
I use to live in nebraska
Oh great, another reason to add to my 'I Hate Humanity' list, *_pencils in 'Chessy, Over-reliant jump scares'._*
my brother in christ the movie hasn't even released yet
Har har har har har 🐻🐤🦊🐇
Me waiting for the other theory channels to comment on this video, I love the sassy sibling channels
I think that Golden city is it Guardian and will protect Abby
Or is the cupcake the dog? If Suzies(?) death stays roughly the same, her dog would also be dead. Dogs' souls? In the cupcake. Chica's pet. The twist is probably that the animatronics are kinda good because they want to protect Abby (Source: Silver eyes trilogy, etcetera. I do think this will be possibly quite like the novels, perhaps.). That also makes more sense as a twist for audiences who haven't gotten a semi-cannon springtrap mpreg Fazbear Frights story about them. Most people don't know where each soul is SUPPOSED to reside. Or at least THOUGHT TO reside. Will there be a separate twist for more serious fans? Probably, hopefully, can't say. As long as there's something exciting for both the really invested fazgoo-oglers and for the casual Jeremy's out there, and everyone in between. I'm hoping for something like the DnD movie from earlier this year. Because I feel your theory really (understandably as it is) overestimates the casual moviegoer. The end of your theory, I feel, is still I think spot on with what I think will happen. Like they say, many roads lead to Rome. Also Jitsi is superior to google meet just saying.
But mike is Michal after. Right then why would his father kidnaping his own son
Tyson Barrie make a video about Thomas Dxd
0:51 I laughed way harder then I should have 😂
Remember when he did this for the mario movie and was completely wrong? Lets not take this as truth or even a good guess just yet.
Can we talk about this film with the strike going on?
Something about going into this knowing google meet sponsored the video makes me think of all the animatronics using google meet to plan when to scare kids.
🐻🐰🐔🦊
15:26 dude the kid has a striped shirt. He’s gonna be the puppet
The Amount of research that goes into these amazes me everytime, You gotta love Matpat,
15:15 I don't know, maybe the stripes shirt means something
I Hope that this movie does well, so we can get sequels, featuring the twisted ones and if there’s one with the humongous pizzaplex, that’d be cool
My birthday is October 27th
That jumpscare was good
15:20  No, no... They resemble the _Puppet._
THE OFFICIAL CROSSOVER OF FILM THEORY AND GAME THEORY
Was waiting for this video!
I think the "Death machine" or "remnant extractor" is a freddy mask but it uses some kind of saw? If you see at 2:34  on the other side of the machine there is kind of a face that looks a bit like freddy. That would make for a weird endo though.
Matpat is the type of guy to solve the lore of a movie without seeing the movie in the first place
Pin me or you hate your fans
Matthew. Matthew. I’m saying this before I even watch the video. Please, calm down. Remember when you tried to solve Sister Location before it came out? Remember how that went? Maybe you should’ve taken that as a sign to not try to spoil something long before it comes out. Edit: Ok, now that I’ve seen the video, I admit I may have overreacted. This seems to be somewhat well put together, but there are some very big logistical leaps that, while I understand why they were made, so still feel a bit dumb. Y’know what? I’m just gonna wait for the actual movie to come out, and then I’ll come back here and point out what was right and what was wrong. I’ll see y’all in about a month!
Style theory is going to go over how the body's fit in the suits maybe
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEE GAME FERYY ON THE FNAF MOVIE YEEEEEEE
The fifth kid looks like the crying child
I could honestly imagine a style theory video about the science behind the wearable springlock suits.
Piggy please
15:21 the puppet? I mean he has a stripes pattern shirt, the puppet has stripes also going by lore the puppet was the first ever victim so it makes sense that it would be the puppet. The cupcake doesn't make sense since 1. It's not big enough to store the body 2. The kid doesn't correlate to the cupcake.  Edit: I saw another comment saying crying child that I thought was interesting
me: sees fnaf me: oh dear matty boi why do you do this... me: sees film theory me: don't stop mat!!!!!!!!!!!
Where the Balloon boy in the movie 🍿
you better be in the movie you practically helped the game rise to the fame it has
October hasnt even started and matpat has solved the movie💀
bro been trying to solve the games for years, solves the movie in one vid.
This is Scott Cofin's is last Fnaf thing
Hello
Bro spoiled a movie that hasn't came out yet
I love you matpat, but im gonna wait until after i watch the movie to watch this video
Ain't no way Mat "GameFilmFoodStyle Theory" Pat is predicting what's about to happen in the FNAF movie an entire month before it releases. This man's gotta be insane or something!
Look at the hair of the fifth kid that supposedly doesn't fit any of the stereotypes of the original five animatronics. He has, an unclear, but slightly visible bowl cut. Just like "the one you should not have killed" from UCN. I kinda just wanted to point that out. >.>
Raise your hand if you have went into a novice theatre to see a horror movie, and expected a happy end.
Hey Mat Pat's team. If an artist/animator wants to reach out and send in some stuff for possible  collaboration, theoretically how would one go about this? Been a fan for years I would love to work with your team.
15:26 I KNEW IT, I KNEW HE WOULD SAY THAT THE KID IS THE CUPCAKE
I personally think the fnaf movie IS part of the game timeline, because in Help Wanted, we literally hear Hand Unit say that, "The games were just made up" and tape girl say, "It's big cover up to make light of actual events" I think this movie is what the game are retailing, after all, it says in the Help Wanted book, "He didn't how many kids went missing" which means not all the details are correct. This movie is what happened before help wanted.
Years and MatPat still has his insanity
It's been 9 years
Dog the movie didnt even come out yet, my theory is that mat pat figured out how to travel through time and space but only uses it on fnaf theory videos.
Imagine you die and all your friends become these metal animals and you just become a cupcake
It’s hasn’t even come out yet jeez chill dawg
Bro the movie hasn't even came out yet and you're already making series
FNAF is not that good of a game and doesn't deserve a movie. I want to see a jetpack joyride movie before I see a FNAF movie.
We’re looking at the Freddy timeline from a, what, 5th perspective?
Eh, you're definitely wrong about Golden Freddy turning Abby into Baby. From the look of things, I'd guess it's Mike's soul in Golden Freddy. Whether that happens while he's a security guard or if he was actually a robot clone the whole time, well you know how this franchise goes. (IT'S ME)
Fnaf on film theory 😮
This is a message to people saying that MatPat’s theories are always wrong, that’s not the point of a theory. A theory is basically an educated guess. It’s not supposed to be the absolute truth.
Aye, whatcha getting at the theater? Dw, i got u all for being with me during the series.
Plot twist : paramount pictures and blum house see this video and now we gotta wait a few more years for them to remake the plot 😂
I can always count on you MatPat
i feel like matthew lillard will get springlocked
Ok
wanna know why abby is with mike for the night shift its cause the babysitter died in the official trailer and official trailer 2
When I first saw the movie trailer, I instantly thought, "I wonder how long it'll take Matpat to solve the movie just from this"
watching all of matpats fnaf theories takes aproxximately longer than it does to watch 3 MOVIES. 3. WHAT DO YOU MEAN ONLY 60 EPISODES?
You really need to do Creatures Of Sonaria lore!!! A new Lore pack recode is coming out soon with Secret Messages, statues of Gods in Ancient Temples, and the game even has its own Language to decode! I'm commenting this on every video until you cover it.
I would liiiveee if it turns out cupcake is haunted by another spirit. 🥹 For so long I believed in it (specially since in FNAF 4 you can get killed by cupcake) 😭😭 and finally it could become cannon!! 😆
Lovely.
spoiled the movie before it even came out 😭😔🙏🏽
What do you mean fifth kid doesn't have a characteristic? What about a striped shirt? Isn't that just Puppet?
What if Mike’s lil bro is the cupcake and the fifth kid in the forest is actually golden freddy
Can’t wait for this to be kinda right but the rest wrong (No offense)
7:20 the movie could also have a plot piece in which William committed a crime and had to change his name to evade the police
Not to be that guy but how would one stuff a child into a cupcake
The idea of the animatronics wanting to turn Abby into one of them doesn't make a lick of sense. The more realistic answer is that they are trying to keep her safe from any and all adults, especially security guards and especially from a little purple guy who keeps poking around the restaurants. It is as phone guy says, "They interact with Kids just fine."
FNAF ALWAYS comes back <3
I can't wait for their to be an eventual Fnaf week crossover
Matpat is probably very excited he can discuss fnaf on both of the original channels (I’m calling film theory original because 2015 was 8 years ago so it’s more old than new)
I think the random kid is the puppet cuz of the stripes
I was hoping for a bad ending tbh.
I’d think the little boy would be the puppet because of the stripped shirt
I know Blum House isn't a struck company, but the fact that he doesn't even mention the strike feels a little scabby I'm not gonna lie
Poor MatPat, getting run to the ground with theories flying in from all over the place. Gotta appreciate this guy's determination. 🤌
Are you in the movie? Just saying
You know that when mar Pat sees this movie he’s just gonna be waiting for that moment when William gets springlocked  Btw I got this from a meme Fnaf theorists when William gets springlocked in the movie😆  Everyone else:😧
Considering the design of the 5th blonde kid you were talking about at the end… I actually think its the puppet 😅 i mean, look at the striped shirt and then look at the puppet’s hands and legs
Striped shirt kid is the PUPPET.
I love the FNAF and Youtube history revisit. Those were great memories and great moments, that first time watching Markiplier play this game before I knew anything and it was just something all my friends talked about and I remember when I was working and the first plushies came out and how big that was, and I cannot wait to see more of it. I genuinely love the topic and theme and it gives me those awesome creepy horror vibes from like Goosebumps and all that. I've always wondered what it would be like if those Chuck E Cheese animatronics just had sentience because they were so perplexing to me as a kid. I actually move into my new place on the 27th of next month so I cannot wait to watch the movie and celebrate lol
2:38 eh kinda reminds me of the 4th closet graphic novel
Ok that scares me because I live in Utah and I remember when I was little I would always have nightmares of fnaf and now I know that they were all in Utah… great
Cant wait to try some of google's meat
MatPat is probably the only person who can spoil you a movie that hasn't been released yet, unless he had been invited to work with them and knows the movie story and is spoiling us now.
Maybe the fifth kid is the puppet, since he's got a striped shirt
1:12 my secret is I was only like 6 when the first trilogy came out and I barely avoided it like i knew foxy and I liked him but knew nothing about him and that was my knowledge of fnaf also mat pat thank you for being the sole reason I know the timeline and like the games
Matpat at 4:10 - 'For the OG's from 2014..." I love that the animators made Markiplier (his current look) in their own art style for that bit. Also, that meme at the end is perfect. It's not just the entire class staring at you, it's the entire FNaF community.
He's doing it again
Or maybe the villain will injure Abby badly and then the animatronics will drag her into a suit themselves
ok but who actually expected the *_FNAF_* movie to end in happy go lucky rainbow sunshine
It hasn’t come out yet JUST WAIT
It took 22 minutes for all of this to happen
I am a new viewer and I did not know your like a big kind of you tuber and I beg you PLEASEEE but warning for the creepy glitches and senses because I have high anxiety and had a panic attack I beg you to ad warning at the start of your videos
This is crazy
I HOPE that Willam Afton is in this movie. “I ALWAYS COME BACK!!!!”
hey uh Mat, the movies not coming till next month-
The straps... The puppet?
That 5th kid’s shirt gives me puppet vibes
MOVIE AINT EVEN OUT YET DUDE
you could do a style theory on the springlock suits
watch out Matpat, get too close and the movie gets delayed for another 8 years
The credits are that Mathew lillard has been cast as afton. 😭 it’s literally googleable
The 5th kid looks like a 1 to 1 copy of the fnaf 4 crying child
What if that fifth kid, instead of being Chica’s Cupcake, is the Puppet? They could be saving the character for the movie.  Evidence(?): When all of the children are dressed according to their respective animatronics, the kid in question is wearing a light and dark striped shirt. This corresponds to the Puppet’s design more so than the Cupcake’s. See 15:00
The fnaf movie is coming out on my birthday
"Its been so many years"   ITS BEEN SO LONG
I would if Matt ever found any Easter eggs down all the rabbit holes he's been down.. bouncing around,lol anyways i think this is a movie that NEEDS to be made RIGHT...well to the best they can lol...🤣🌈🌻⚡
I am a little upset the filmmakers decided to stray from the actual lore but I mean since it is fnaf it makes sense, I just hope we get a good movie.
5:34 Excuse fakin me? That's a V6 2006 accord!! That is not an average car. Smh disliked unsubbed
*Discord left the chat*
He already solved it it didn’t even come out yet
I think William could still be Mike’s father, remember the clothes they both wore in the second trailer, (the first full-length trailer, not the final one) they were inverted colors from each other, and even the walls were. As for “Mike’s dad”, he could easily be his stepfather or something. And before you say if he was it would’ve said stepfather in the cast, I’m pretty sure they usually don’t put spoilers in the cast, and he’s probably meant to throw us fans off so that we’ll be surprised when it turns out William actually is his father.
Then the FNAF movie was delayed so they could say Matpat was wrong
I think mikes brother gets turened into a robot and then he gets the memories back and stuff and then mike finds out purple kidnapped and killed him so he fights purple man
6:40 yeah Matpat in a freddy suit is gonna break through that wall with a chainsaw to finish the job
Are we sure that the Springbonnie suit isn’t broken because, well because it’s springbonnie and not Springtrap or was it confirmed it’s 100% springtrap
Dude I have the point were I see him in my nightmares when ever I here his name
I would love to see mangle in the 2nd movie (along with the toy animatronics and the puppet)
Thanks matpat keep working on the LOREEEEEE!!!!
It’s getting so close now…this is gonna be awesome!
Bro has early access 💀
Hey, Matt, don't you make a cameo In the post credit scene for this movie.
It would give the “ITS ME” from ol golden freddy mcfazbear a reason to say it and a lot more meaning
Dude I am so exited for the moive
I was planning to not watch trailers for spoilers but I can’t not watch matpat
We have infiltrated Film Theory
I think the fifth kid is golden freddy as in c.c he has a stripped shirt and everything or it is garret maybe bc the community is absolutely torn on his name is it Chris is it Evan is it Oliver is garret his first name or last name and does garret fit anywhere but that seems to suspicious way to suspicious but it is a cool call back
The last kid was wearing stripes so they could be the puppet
The boy that could be the cupcake also could be the marionette just changed due to the striped shirt the movie could have changed who marionettes soul is
I always come back Willam Aston 2014
Sorry Mat. But I’ve decided that I won’t receive any spoilers for this movie. I’l be back when the movie’s out tho!
I dont expect this to be a good movie but im hoping it will be a fun and atleast decently acted movie
What if the cupcake is Susie's dog from fruity maze. Its way smaller than the other animatronics, obviously connected to Chica in a way and also bites like a dog when attacks in the trailer.
Yeah hes gone insane
I hope Mike’s father is actually his stepdad and William will have a Darth Vader moment
Mat i swear if you have a copy of the movie script and low key spoiling the film, im unsubscribing, lol 😂😂. I swear you're always on point for the theories, its scary 😮
Five nights at mats
I am so glad it is releasing on my birthday. Although I am not going to watch this until the movie comes out
A video interrupted my Google commercial
You should be in that movie
Yo but it didn’t even come out yet chill
Know he ain’t seeing this, but the 5th child is the puppet
I personally believe Mike dies and is in golden Freddy while trying to protect abby
who wants to bet mike is going to get scooped in one of the sequels making are guy mike into micheal afton
"Thanks to Google Meet for sponsoring a PORTION of today's video." Can Google not afford the whole video? 🤨😂
Googles meat?
BRO GOT SPONSORED BY THE ENTIRETY OF GOOGLE, AGAIN! ARE YOU KIDDING? MATPAT THIS IS A GIANT DEAL
11:12  SKIP THE SPONSOR
Google what now?!?!?!!!!???!?!
still don't know he is crying chiled
I can't be the only one desperately wanting to see the spring-lock incident happen to William in the movie- right?
I haven't watched the video yet but I'm making the prediction  The fnaf movie is a canon movie in the fnaf lore
Mat Pat: "Which animatronic could this 5th kid with the stripped shirt become?" Me: "The Puppet?  Is that not obvious." Also Mat Pat: "THE CUPCAKE!!!!"
Another thing on how you might be right on Garret and golden Freddy is the age of the suit and its decay that could be because the years he has been stuck in it but I'm not sure why one of GF eyes is missing maybe Abby and garret end up sharing golden Fredy so it matches with the games on have 2 souls in GF.
Nah matapat saying he uses meet for a lot more then talk then showing Stephanie is the funniest part of this video
Honestly im under the impression that the "they want to make her one of them" is just a 100% lie to get him in more danger
Matpat better be in at least on fnaf movie for the amount of contribution and theorizing he has done for the franchise
it didnt even come out yet and he solved it!?
i like the point that he thinks the kid is the cup cake but just one quick l;ook at his shirt will tell you other wise
15:05 I thought it was common sense that the kid wearing a stripped shirt which leads to the "the puppet" Charlie, the first victim  I mean COME ON PEOPLE
Ho
For some reason, I didn’t skip the sponsor. Idk why
I think FNAF should come out with a popup pizza plex store for just like a month like Omega Mart just to drive MatPat over the edge and give him something for FNAF over in Food Theory too lol
my name ia  garrett
I know a video you can do for style theory: is the springtrap suit actually wearable
The fifth kid might actually be golden freddy since it wears the same clothes as the crying child in the fnaf game
We just not gonna talk about mat pat getting sponsored by google
Kid number five is wearing a striped shirt with jeans; dose that remind you of anyone?     It's the Crying Child. He's also pictured in the forefront when Freddy's kid is in the back. They state Freddy with importance earlier, so why would he be in the back if he's not the real leader. From a film making perspective this makes sense.
Fashion theory: how practical is a spring lock suit
What if in the end they corner him and water hits the suit making the guy in the suit die
Hello
15:26 Exactly! That’s literally the exact same thing I thought as well! Like, he’s there with the others, he has a gold shirt, but he’s gotta be Golden Freddy right? Well no, Cupecake is technically possessed too, and if he’s with the others, that means he also wants to make Abby like them, so he’s gotta be the Cupecake. And obviously the Bite Victim is Golden Freddy, the one protecting Abby. I honestly thought I was like the ONLY one who’s thought of this…
still should have starred Markiplier
Google Meat
How about the striped kid being this world’s Puppet?
ITS NOT EVEN OUTT
we always joked about fnaf ending up on film theory but now it's finally happened
Not Matpat trying to solve the FNaF movie before it even comes out 😭
So, After winning the hunger games. Peeta Mellark became a brokie and applied for a job at Freddy Fazbears
IT HASNT EVEN COME OUT YET CHILL OUT 😭😭
Finally Fnaf is in Film Theory next for Food Theory they have to make Chika’s cupcake and for Style Theory they have to see if the new suits can prevent odors
Fun fact: (While not useful, it’s just something cool you can do.) You can see the animatronic models at Universal Hollywood’s HHN at the Blumhouse show
But what about the puppet? They can’t ignore a character that integral to the lore… can they? 🙂
it would genuinely be borderline CRIMINAL. completely deserves at least a cameo. same with markiplier 😭
17:13 man mat you will use anything to show how serious somthing💀
Seeing FNAF on Film Theory is VERY strange.
Dont let me in the movie? Heres the plot before the movie Comes out🖕🏽🖕🏽
I feel like Afton will be springlocked at the end, it just feels right. Also, what if the sequel is a prequel like FNAF 2 was a prequel
15:15 kid Is dressed up as crying child from fnaf 4 minigames
Bro, the movie hasn’t even come out. CHILL FOR ONCE
The kid 'cup cake' looks like the crying child
My theory is that the kid that got kidnapped in the part of the flash back could be the antagonist in the bunny suit who probably got older and sough for revenge but thats just a theory a dumb theory😂
I don’t even think I registered the title of this video I saw the thumbnail and clicked.
Something I’ve noticed is how similar this is to the books like the first novel books
15:05 that kid looks suspiciously like the crying child
p
Mat this twist is big and I agree that it is separate from the game but the bite victim was wearing a striped shirt so don’t it make sense for it to be golden Freddy? Plus I don’t think afton could of fit this child in the cupcake
The FNAF movie is almost out. FINALLY!!!!!
Golden Freddy IS the cupcake
LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!!
Though I in no way want this film to fail, in fact the opposite, I feel a strong sense that it will not be very good to have a watered down, non canon version of this as the concept. I hope they knock it out of the park but from promo I just don't feel like I connect with it. And im a huge fan of FNAF
Does this confirm he’s not in the movie? I feel like he wouldn’t be allowed to make a theory if he was on set
Fnaf Hates this guy
Omg
Thank you Matpat
I have a theory that the mimic looks the way it does because it's trying to mimic Gregory look at the facial structure it's trying to look like Gregory the best that can with its limited resources that's why it's eyes turned orangie brown it's why it  has human-like teeth and what I can assume is supposed to resemble hair on the right side of its head well it's left our right it even got rid of the claws on one of the hands but hey that's just a theory A GAME THEORY
I also think the saw thing may be a replacement for the scoop
:)            Did anyone else notice how foxy was replaced by cupcake? I know why. Its because the first trailer for fnaf. How Bonnie replaced foxy in the fnaf1 trailer. And was realved In the game? Thats what is going to happen.       (This is a obvious joke laugh pls)
I think they are starting to make more movies related to games lol
I think they are starting to make more movies related to games lol
As someone who lives in Utah I take this as a win🤑🤑🤑🤑
Garrett is control during the majority of the movie, then near the end Cassidy gets upset about it and takes it out on Abby.
Oh yEAAA
Scott punching his wall since he can't reshoot the movie to make Mat wrong
I can’t believe it’s been all this time and NOW I just realise that the remnant is just a ripoff of vitae from amnesia…
What if Mr cupcake was Susie’s dog
38 days till the arf arf ar-ar, arf arf arararar. ar ar arar ar, ar ararf😎
Do a theory for Sony Spider-Man universe like how a sinister 6 film could be and work  how daredevils and the other series characters will fit in the future of the mcu like what’s canon
Well no more fnaf
Fnaf 6 takes place in utah because when you get a lawsuit, it says the court of Utah. So that means so is security break and also fredbears.
Wait the fifth child looks like that kid from the fazbear frights  who lured the kids to the golden freddy suit.
I swear to GOD... There better be the afton springlock failure scene in this movie or I am going to cry.
Crazy theory the kid that getting kidnapped is the bite victim that’s why he is possessing golden Freddy and the next movie will have the main animatronics get purposed into the sister location animatronics as we go back and forth from them trying to save baby and back in time to the bite victim dreaming about the fanf 4 location and in the third movie we continue with the phone guy from fanf 3 finding spring trap and bringing him to the fanf 3 location where a new protagonist will have to stop him while going insane due to the phantoms it ends with the whole building getting burned down ending spring trap
MATPAT'S A DAD?!...im not a true fan if i didnt know that😢
Why is there a Five Nights at Freddy's cookbook? Does it have the recipe for Chuck-E-Cheese Pizza?
Matt… there will be more lore when the book of the movie comes out.
3:38  ITS FAZ-GOO
I’m genuinely curious if MatPat will be taking notes WHILE in the movie…😂💀
When this movie comes out matpat will officially have lost his mind
How would Afton stuff a whole kid inside of the cupcake lol
im not trusting you after that last time you said the Mario movie was going to be a musical
add 20 videos can't solve a franchise is impossible
The blades you reference have actually been shown to us before. In The Forth Closet novel on page 212 is the only other time they have existed in the series and there the blades are actually just reformed pieces of Elizabeth's (Charlie's imposter) face being moulded into a sawblade.
October 27 is 1 week for  my birthday
Yes 8 years!!! I’m so happy!!!!! <3
The saw machine could be the torture story about the girl trapped inside Funtime Freddy
I think the movie is going to be a big flop
Or hear me out the reason springtrap isn’t decayed is because  he hasn’t been springlocked yet so how they defeat him is he gets springlocked
I don't think that 5th kid is cupcake, I think that he will be the puppet.
Alright i have another answer for the kid that you said was the cupcake, i personality think he could be golden freddy but what if Mike's brother was also golden freddy, two soul's in one golden freddy body like how is in the games
dawg it hasnt come out yet how did you solve it 😭😭
Imagine if this turns out to be like his genloss theory, completely wrong.
Oh my god he actually did move fnaf to film theory, now all that’s left is food theory and style theory
October is 1 week for my birthday
Imagine being murdered and reincarnated as a Cupcake, I'd just give up and sleep all day and night.
Beck killed by Joe Goldberg and sentenced to eternal torment in the fnaf universe
I have no idea what FNAF is.
Now fnaf is seeping into the food theory channel. You cannot escape matpat
1:37  Well you have to remember Mat, you also do GT live So it's well over 100
cool
Did you know that my birthday is on the 28 of October
Imagine if they postpone the film because he got it right
did he just spoil the movie without even watching ?
The movie isn’t even here yet and he already made a film theory video 💀
Discord is better than google meet
hmm, im conflicted on one hand, youre awful at movie predictions and theyre always wrong (even if they sound nice) on the other hand, if this is anything like the games, you got virtually everything correct and now theyll butcher the movie with a whole new re-edit and rushed new scenes just to make you wrong
last kid is the puppet look at the stripes he has on his shirt
Did matpat realize that it could be the scooper
10:36 can I use it on my 5 year old 3ds?
Pretty sure Lillard confirmed he was Afton on Instagram   Edit: yup  One of his posts. Can't send the link unfortunately YouTube won't let me for spam and scam reasons.
The film theory we waited years for.
Personally I think the kid in the yellow top hat is golden Freddy and the one in the _brown shirt_ is regular Freddy. the kid in the top hat looks similar to the boy playing Mike's brother as well.
Matt saying "I need to know your secrets" as if he isn't half the reason FNAF is talked about so much lol
this belonged on game theory imo
2:20 Mat, has this ever worked before?
I LOVE THISSSSS
I say the sequel is sister location
Comment👍
Finally, fnaf is on film theory.
"two young siblings, one kidnapped by afton and the other growing up haunted by the memory" sounds like the books, i wonder if our mc will be a robot, and we get an "i took YOU" moment too
Someday, far, far in the future,  WE WILL STILL BE TRYING TO FIGURE FNAF LORE OUT
This guy is going to be in this movie so he could be lying to trink us
Nebraska, the promised land of corn and some more corn
Wait until blumhouse pulls a steel wool and delays the movie because he figured out the story
Either: MatPat is in this moving and made this video to throw us off from what the plot is about. OR He's not in the movie (outrageously dumb choice from the producers) and this video is genuine.
The 5th murdered kid is absolutely the puppet with the stripped shirt he has on
Nice vid🎉
I love you ❤
Do a theory on helluva boss
Its not even out and he figured out the lore
I can just imagine matpat at the theater with a notepad scribbling down every little detail he notices in the movie
there was like withered foxy in the back i dont know if it was edited or not i saw it on tik tok
For years, film theory has dreaded the fnaf theory
Noticing a distinct lack of any form of reference to the puppet in this movie so far...
Alnost 9 years of predicting that there was gonna be a movie
Keep in mind that MatPat was 100% right about "Joker" being a "King of Comedy" rip-off.
15:18 striped shirt, maybe crying child or puppet
Man, what did Mat do to our good ole boy SC to get this timeline?
I think he just spoiled the movie
*ALREADY!?*
how long would it take to watch every theory matpat made for fnaf? just gotta prepare before the movie comes out
"Golden fredbear" 13:46
Matt I think you missed a big point I think this movie is babys origin story an thts why the animatronics friend Abby. Because why would a serial killer wanna hide the place where he can lure an plan his kills more methodically like hiring a fired security guard who got to aggressive or even better some wondering kids who don't believe the tail. The movie being babys origin story fits way better an also fits the kid who gets kidnapped comment on sm an it fits what we know about baby as well just remember sister location witch I theories tht sister location happened in Nebraska or was gonna be originaly built there then the location was changed. So theres my theory we gonna see babys origin story
Here within 1 hour claim here  👇
For fashion theory for fnaf should be about how the spring lock costume would be possible or not
Bro it sounds so good if they add “I always come back” at the end if one of the three movies if Afton burns
mystery kid has a striped shirt, the puppet has stripes, I think I cracked the code. No need to thank me.
No intro, not watching.
No movie, game, or show can hide from this man. Even if they’ve only released trailers from something that isn’t even out yet. This man will find out everything
2:34 is that golden Freddy's head?
with the 5 ghost children, i feel like the one with the yellow shirt and hat is golden freddy? and the kid with the brown shirt is freddy? like it would make sense to give golden freddy the hat to distinguish him from the girl in yellow (chica). and regarding the cupcake, i feel like it’s the girl who got stuffed in chica’s dog. there’s that whole part in pizzeria simulator showing how afton lured her to her death by claiming he had her dead dog. idk how the details of that would work, but at least in the trailer chica seems to throw her cupcake at the intruder much like someone would have their dog attack someone.
Matpat I ever ever heard fnaf united I started high school that was 3 years ago. I only look up dinosaurs on YouTube
Im worried the movie wont make much money as they are stupidly putting it on streaming the same day it is released to theaters, they should of axed the streaming plan since they will lose money and I dont want it to do so bad they wont make rest of the movies.
Is the crying child
There should be a theory on whether this goes on game theory or film theory
Guys the straps on the kid
WHOOP WHOOP
The thing is, since so much of the story has already been told, the movie will probably have a much more engaging tale to follow than the first and second games. And if the movie does well enough (as it probably will given the popularity of the series) they can easily set up the plots for more movies.
It ain't even October yet😭
Recon for fnaf l0l and fnaf can t make number 2 Matt pat  guest it all !
bro gonna bully scott to make more fnaf movies and games
Can’t wait for the 60+ part FNaF movie theory’s
The animatronic is so cute. No wonder the kids were killed by them.
Actually excited for the possibility of learning what recipe they decided on to be the *"OFFICIAL TASTE"* of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Ngl.
Honestly, if there isn’t a spring lock scene in the movie. Imma be so disappointed
Your first fnaf film theory ep a great honor
It might be a bit obvious but the 5th Child has a stripey top -  is it possible we also get the Puppet in this movie?
I feel like fnaf would release clothing merch justto spite Mat
matpat a boy in a striped shirt
The last kid I don't think would be the cupcake but rather the puppet with the shirt design
Lets honorate the fact that now fnaf theories are in film theory instead of game theory
Game Theory- Check Film Theory- Check Now all we need is the springlock suit style theory and the food theory episode based on the cookbook
The spring, Bonnie costume
hi mat
what is fnaf?
Funny to think that it took a video game about a pizza place so long to release their recipes
Unless the twist is that Mike's dad isn't actually his dad.  Maybe Afton actually IS their dad and the kids were taken away from him.
purple guys gotta be one heck of a child killer if he stuffed a human being into a cupcake
Please Mat you have to cover miraculous adventures of ladybug and cat noir!!!
I thought I solved it a couple hours after it came out on my birthday my theory was that it takes place during the silver eyes because of the people opening the garage reminded me of the main people in the book as well as the seen of Mike waking up directly parrallels with the book
I feel like that 3rd kid has some connection to the crying child, the striped shirt feels connected to golden Freddy but idk lol
7:08 We can see that the pizzeria is closed and some time has passed. So why couldn’t Steve just be William’s new name that he choose after the pizzeria closed because he needed a new job?
MATPAT COOKED.
If they have seen you matpat they know what fnf is
Vengeful spirit come on now
can't wait for the fnaf and fortnite crossover
The 5th kid has a striped shirt so I think he is marionette
the kid who you said is the cupcake is probably the puppet/marionette because of the striped clothes
I cant believe that fnaf js releaseing a second movie
I’m not expecting a happy ending for this movie 🍿 but However this movie ends it will probably leave us on a cliffhanger 😮
The cupcake kid is wearing stripes Now I want you to name One of the two defining features of crying child
Golden Freddy is Cassidy ok THAT IS NOT GAME accurate
Good thing the William had to face these guys and not a mute Nicholas cage trying to get his truck working again
0:19
Scott is gonna see this and be discouraged that his movie has been broken down to basics and already solved and cancel it altogether. He already has canceled older projects due to backlash or unwanted feedback, and not that this video is rude or horrible but you're playing with fire MatPat
Do a spring look suit theory for how they would work irl
I really hope the puppet plays a role in the movie. Considering they play a monumental piece of the story. At least game wise.
I watched this video in the first 2 hours it was released
I’m actually kinda shocked that we have seen no evidence of the puppet being in this movie, considering how important she is to the lore
Im still sad William dalphone isn't gonna be purple guy
The second child has a stript shirt like the pattern of the cupcake ig? idk
Matpat is awesome!
I don’t think that was a revenant extractor I just think it was someone getting stuffed inside a suit I mean sure your eyes would not pop out but I don’t think they would show that detail and plus we’ve never seen what the inside of the suit look like so maybe that’s what it looks like I don’t have it the end of suit make everything move have gears inside the sued for custom movements. It makes sense.
But in the books the twin brother wasn’t actually kidnapped? So is Mike going to be a robot and thinks his twin brother was taken but it’s really him?
no you didn’t
With the FNaF movie now approaching, this would be the perfect time to try and do a 4-way FNaF week with all the channels. Game Theory could do it’s usual, Film has the movie to cover, Food could do something about the pizza in the series (Idfk what that means but it’s something) and then Style can maybe do the style of a Springlock Suit
I’m proud to say that I’m officially an OG of the first Fnaf movie film theory and I do mean the FIRST!
Dawg it's not even out 💀
So if Dave is William and mike is his son and the kid is his son and mike’s brother then WHY DOES WILLIAM kidnapping his son ??? Is there no bite of 83/87
I don't really care whether or not the theory is gonna turn out to be accurate, I'm just glad it's too late for the film to be completely changed if it IS right like security breach
What if Abby becomes baby as a condition for the animatronics saving Vanessa and William
I plan to hopefully see the movie day 1 when it comes out and ive been watching every theory (not just Mat's) on this franchise- I will not be able to stop talking about this movie if its actually good.
Bro this ain’t even come out yet how this man even solve it
in the novels, doesnt afton have a different or fake name? his counselor plaque might just be a fake name in-universe to cover his child kidnapping tracks
GIVE RIGGY A RAISE  spread the word every one
Already? This man is is the theroy flash
Instead of the cupcake, maybe the kid is the puppet? You can see the striped shirt and the puppet will almost definitely be showing up in the sequel
We can always count on matpat to theorize on things that havent come out more then when they ACTUALLY come out.Keep up the good work!Also...the kid is wearing a striped shirt...and cupcakes candle is striped...Oh my god...Pls if u read this,mention me in next vid!
The animatronics in this movie are just cheesy looking with their facial expressions and look. I cant take them seriously
Who else thought Bonnie was holding a shotgun in the thumbnail? 💀
"Father...It's me, Michael."
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
You should make a fashion theory on the logistics of a real life animatronic suit!
Did he just get sponsored by Google??
Can we get a video for the cupcake
Do it episode about movie element
Just an idea the kid has blond hair so maybe he is golden freddy
This is matpats revenge for not being in the movie.
this does kind of align with the whole Crying Child Mikes brother in the games possessing Golden Freddy in the games🤔
At first I thought the movies would have gone into more detail on the lore of the games but now seems like they are more parallel similar to the books
Arbaba lalalala babab
The Fifth kid had a striped tshirt though...
I could see a moment where Abby, sadly, becomes Baby Circus. But it is still herself so that she can use her new animatronic body to defeat Afton and lock him away before destroying herself, not knowing that enough of herself survived to be a problem in the future.
I've been here as A Loyal FNAF Fan Since 2015 and This makes Me more invested in seeing the movie.  Matthew Lillard Is Stew From SCREAM 1 & Shaggy from Scooby Doo!!!
Will he predict something fnaf before its out again?
it’s kinda surreal seeing a fnaf theory on film theory
😨
5 years later  Matpat: ok I know I've made 278 episodes on these 4 movies but I think I've finally solved the FNAF movies
And the award for most random sponsor goes to film theory
What if the animatronics win. And join the good side Mike dies in the process and becomes freddy and they drive off in a taxi?
If only Tom Holland was cast in this movie. Mat would have a light workload.
First fnaf theory not on game theory!!!!!!!!!
How was he stuffed into the cupcake?
I’m bringing a checklist to the theater with all the things he’s said to see how right he is.🙃
matpats mental health is deteriorating faster than springtrap after he got gg ez 10 comboed by the suit
the REAL THEORY is that MAT PAT IS THE PURPLE GUY!!!!!!!!!!!!
DUD I LIVE IN NEBRASKA🌽🌽🌽👁🫦👁
love the theory but I'm surprised matpat said "accidentally stumble into a clown outfit" instead of reenacting the ice cream mini-game and possessing baby, making the second movie probably about the story of sister location because it would be a sister's location. just a thought. :)
Everyone: Abby is an anagram for Baby Me: Yabb
Can I join your Google meet?
Imagine if william afton was played by Markiplier that would be crazy he would be a perfect william afton
I really hope you’re right…
I in fact be screaming my head off
You could do a theory on how suits work in fashion theory
Question is there a theory or a video of mat going over the chest in fnaf 4
While a good theory I personally believe that the boy in brown is meant to symbolize Freddy as his suit is brown and the boy with the top hat is golden Freddy for me but that's just me. Aside from that it's still a great theory!
I actually love these episodes
The person suspected as cupcake has striped clothes so potentially puppet setup???
Matthew Lillard was casted as William Afton! OF COURSE, THATS WILLIAM AFTON YOU GOOF!
Let’s goooooooo I love you
Not gonna lie, even if it's just a gag, the cupcake attack from the trailer is a thing of beauty, in my opinion. Any chance that Suzie's dog was named Cupcake?
I think the kid could be golden freddy because of his golden hair.
Are you sure bout that?
The movie hasn’t even come back then
bro solved the fnaf movie lore before it even came out 💀
Eyyy I saw that jump scare in the cold open, I see you taking inspiration 😏
What if it isn’t that deep? What if the FNAF movie just gives us the motive for Michael to work at the FNAF 1 location
That part at the end where you where saying the stuff about them banding together felt like I was watching a real movie
Sweating for movies is crazy
Ngl the only thing I live about the movie is the fact that CoryXKenshin is in it. Even if it's a just for a couple of frames.
I really hope this movie explains the Lore some and I hope this movie explain who the heck is Jane Afton Aunt Jane mike in this movie and I do feel like Fazbear's entertainment and Jane Afton is a villain and she owns Fazbear's entertainment and she's working with William so Fazbear entertainment is a villain to with William working together so yeah but I'm just wondering is the books movies games are they all Canon to  each other or are not I heard FNAF has all multiple world alternate universes alternate realities separate continuity from each FNAF movies books games and they have differences but similarities they're all not going to be the same in one they're going to be all different?? But I heard the movie is just going to be its own thing so the books and the games have to be their Own thing to if there are a own separate individual different alternate universes alternate realities?
Nahh its not even out yet 😭😭😭 💀💀
Bro really went with “it’s been so many years” and not “it’s been so long” missed opportunity
I thought that the zoom and music after MatPat says "William Afton" was a gag, but my computer just crashed randomly for a second.
Can't wait for FNaF to reach Food Theory too when they find an excuse to cook some of the recipies from the official FNaF cookbook.
15:12 Are we all going to ignore the fact this kid has a striped shirt
i'll be back when the movie is out and he's watched it and completely broke it all down
NOOOO you shouldn't have made this video they're gonna delay the movie to change the story!
18:19 LIES SHE APPEARED IN FNAF WORLD FIRST
Weird one but I believe the 5th kid that mat pat thinks is the cupcake is the puppet reason why, each kid wears something related to their character and what Is the 5th one wearing a stripey jumper/ sweater but that's just my opinion for all I know I could be missing the mark 100%
Google meat
I think you're right about the fifth child being the cupcake. He's got a brown t-shirt on which would symbolise the "chocolate cake" bit of the animatronic, plus I noticed he was blonde (maybe even...strawberry blonde?) which could indicate the pink icing. Plus there's the fact that we see the cupcake mauling the guy in the second trailer on its own without Chicca which means it would be its own animatronic. I've wondered whether this was the case since the second movie came out. Thanks MatPat for also noticing ^^
Striped shirt, gotta be the puppet
Nah the 5th kid is the puppet I'm calling it. Striped shirt for a reason?
I've been thinking through the 5 children in the trailers. People are saying that: Bunny ears w/ Purple shirt is Bonnie, Hook w/ red shirt is Foxy, girl in yellow is Chica, kid in tophat is Freddy. I raise that the kid in Brown is actually Freddy, and top hat in *yellow* is Golden Freddy. Just a thought, but it seems GT seems to think otherwise
Don’t wanna spoil but mike ends up being golden Freddy because the little torture device thing is actually to stuff him into a suit and I know that because there is a photo with mike and the head is golden freddy with the same missing ear and one eye and also mike had the suit on. Just to clear some stuff up
I joked he would do this in a chat I'm in,and he actually did it.
15:05 The fifth child is kurt cobain
my god mat pat atleast wait for the movie to come out and save your sanity solving fnaf for the 80th time
it aint even come out yet 😭
I have the feeling they'll just do a default generic horror plot and call it a day, no souls or dead kidz in animal suits 😂😂
Man this is actually sounds spot on the ending with afton in the wall to become spring trap is prolly true
0:00 I literally thought he said abortion
Fnaf is also in the film channel huh?
he's the crying kid, stripped shirt golden Freddy, bite of 19-...something...
Bruh really looked at a child actors twitter history to find some lore          Now that’s dedication
The only thing that bothers me at 14:15 is, why isn't the one slightly hidden kid, with a golden tophat, Freddy? And the brown-ish shirt kid the cupcake? I would say this is meant to be actually Freddy and the one with the golden tophat and shirt, which is also slightly hidden, would I call golden Freddy, in my opinion. Am I wrong?
About the cupcake kid. I agree with you, a real big hint about it is his shirt, looking similar to the cupcake liner
Day two of asking matpat to do another genshin impact video 😅
I mean security breach has a hoodie so it's not a surprise. Also, pretty sure that guy about to die via the remnant extractor is phone guy. I think that Steve guy might represent Henry and he will burn the animatronics eventually maybe in a future movie in an attempt to set the souls free.
The only way to eternal life is Jesus!
I always thought that it was the pet dog of Susie (Chica's Soul) that possessed the Cupcake, not a lot of evidence for this claim, just always thought that it would kinda make sense for them to stick together especially considering the fact that they died right after one another with Susie getting murdered during the grieving process of losing her dog.
I always had this thought in my mind ever since the fnaf movie was announced since the late 2010s where the fnaf movie theory would be posted either in the game theory channel or film theory Guess it was film theory
And now the movie follows Security Breach's example and delays itself to completely rewrite the plot frfr
Quick the video is still new everyone watch for scott. We all know what he does when a theory is dropped. GIVE US THE WORDS
Im guessing that the sequel will be a FNAF 3 and Sister Location hybrid.
Yeah the animatronics have taken another one your sanity
When Matpat started questioning the identity of the child with the horizontal stripped shirt I got worried.
You should do a theory on spooky Month it has a lot of secrets😊
I clicked as soon as the thumbnail said FNAF!
It’s strange that golden Freddy is not attacking Abby but the other animatronics are
15:05 I can't believe you forgot about the puppet
Ho would like to see a sringlock failier at the end of the movie
I'm from Nebraska
Wouldn't the 5th kid be the crying child? They got the same shirt.
imagin matpat collabing with the theorizer lol
Oh good, can't even escape FNAF theories on the non-gaming channels. What's next, a Food Theory about the kind of pizzas they served or what flavor cake there was at the crying child's birthday party? How about a Style Theory on how fashionably uncomfortable it would be to wear an animatronic suit?  EDIT after watching the intro: I WAS KIDDING!!!!
Fnaf unironically tried to sneak in Nebraska
Wow!
I wish the movie followed the games lore
I think the kid wearing the BROWN shirt is freddy since the kid wearing the hat is also wearing yellow which I think is golden freddy
A FANFCOOK BOOK? I MUST GET IT
Yo mat pat can you make a Elemental theory? I have a feeling something is going down in the city.
It is the scuper
Bros doing it
Could the fifth kid be the puppet? I mean, he has a striped shirt on. Just a theory and the post credit scene could be us seeing the puppet.
At this point Blud is going to solve the entire universe or are funeral 💀💀💀
Give It Up Mat! Just Wait Next He's Gonna Make A NEW Channel For Fnaf
bro matpat you HAVE to listen to what I'm gonna say. in the comic Silver Eyes, one in the group says that they really loved and admired a yellow singing bear (if I remember correctly) This could tie to how Abby befriends golden Freddy. This could be HUGE.
Im from Utah
Now do a style theory on wether a spring lock suit could be real or not and how it would be made
it is probably going to be like M3GAN. the theatrical release is gonna be pg13 and the peacock release is gonna be rated R which is why they are coming out on the same day
It's not even released yet- how-
NEBRASKAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!
No one: Absolutely no one: Matpat: Theorising about Mathew Lilard being William Afton even though it's already confirmed as he's been cast as William Afton
I heard that the puppet was going to be in the film so maybe that kid with the striped shirt is the marionette
MatPat calm down bro. It's not even out, you should get a good therapist.
That would be quite the twist Abby eventually becoming Baby
LETS GO! FILM THEORY HAS FINALLY BEEN INFECTED BY FNAF! (not counting The Walten Files) now all we need is a Style Theory about springlocks and a food theory about the cook book!
Mikes dad has to be a step dad I don't think Mike remembers William
I wasn’t expecting film theory to jump scare me 😂
The fifth kid does have a defining characteristic, golden blond hair
At this point I don't even need to watch the movie anymore. I know the entire thing now
this actually makes sense good on your mat
3:43 so basically it’s Uncharted but better
I mean technically the boy with the striped shirt could be a reverence to the Puppet and its Surprise reveal,  but then again that does sound also like a Red Herring
What if Abby DOES time travel from the ball pit back to the 80s, gets stuffed into Golden Freddie, and now share like a soul bond because they’re the same person? REALLY throwing it out there considering the current timeline of fnaf, but this is a movie so things could be different.
The last kid has a shirt just like the crying child
FNAF MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???
Wait Team Theorist the company is using the GOOGLE ecosystem? Not Mac or Window?
It’s so weird seeing a FNaF theory on Film Theory
leave it to matpat to solve the movie before its out
this is the most overly-complex theory ive heard and its kinda exactly what scott and Emma said they DONT want to do.  Especially that ending, abby dies out of nowhere? baby suit that general audiences have no idea about?
All I want to know is if everyone's favorite character, Phone Guy, is going to be in the movie.
Kid with stripes... am I the only one who is thinking the puppet?
Please do another episode on skibidi toilet
if the bite 87 isn't in the movie i would be disappointed
Week 1 of asking matpat to make the next 3 of the science of bending if there's no science in them at least tell me
it has started
What if the unknown spirt is the puppet, I know puppet is possessed by Charlie but the striped short and this movies kinda changing some stuff I think it's possible
if matpat doesn't have a post credit scene im gon be heated
Gi
Matpat you really need to take a break, this movie isn't even out yet
FNAF has warped this guys brain to the point of no return
imagine movie-only fans being absolutely mindblown that there's like 8 games and a boatload of books
Every franchise must have an "In Case Matpat Makes a Video" script on hand, ya know, just in case.
Hopefully William gets springlocked at the end of the movie
I will be disappointed if matt pat is correct about this
please make a splatoon theory pleassee theeres a lot of creepy loooooore plus the side order dlc
Day 2 of askin for a happy meat farms thoery pt 2...
the fifth kid there is wearing a similar shirt to the crying child
0:09 shoudl've said "its been so long" ngl
There better be a post-credits scene with Cops investigating the scene, and the rookie goes "What happened here?" Then the detective replies "I'm not sure, but I havr a theory..." Camera pan into MatPat the detective reveal
The first time a fnaf video is in a film about channel
Finally, FNAF has broken free from the confines of Game Theory. Soon, all 4 channels will be under its sway.
I think the last kid is puppet 15:22
The only thing I'm the most excited about is seeing if they try and portray William's death. There's many takes on how people think it would go down, so I'm curious how Blumhouse would portray it if they plan to put a scene like that in the movie.  If it is being planned, I really hope it's done well.
I don’t know why but the way the cupcake attacked the robber was just funny to me I don’t know why and the fnaf movie is not the first time we saw the cupcake moving independently we saw it in Vr too
I really think Golden Freddy will just have 2 souls like in the games, I think it would be odd for cupcake to now have its own soul mainly because it always was a little weird with how it acted.   Also come on Mat, it's SpringBonnie not Springtrap before he dies.
steve raglin is most likely a fake name. we know he used a fake names in the books
Matpat, maybe you could do something about the springlocks
I swear if MatPat isn’t in the movie I’m gonna be so upset. He deserves a cameo in it.
This feels really good though I would like to add one more piece of evidence to help with the cupcake part! The kid who you theorized to be cupcake had on a striped brownish shirt that kinda looks like a cupcake wrapper-thing
how tf did you solve it before it even came out
Day 92 of asking for a film theory on stranger things
Bro Mattpat.  slow down. the movies not even out yet.
And in the cast i think his name is william afton or william idk
And in just the last year studying your videos and comic dubs of the silver eyes trilogy I've learned alot Thank you
I find it kinda funny that 2 main pieces of evidence from that one kids insta lol he's like tom holland with leaking movie info lol
The 5th kid also has a stripe shirt 👀
I hate school
This movie is not lore based  I’m trying to save you matpat
Mat pat:thank you for Google's MEAT for sponsiring this video
Now they just need a real life restaurant and a clothing brand, then Matpat would never escape them
Not related to the movie at all, but I just saw that under Twisted Wolf's description in the character encyclopedia, it says that FOUR twisted animatronics were created by Afton. Chica and Foxy aren't listed as Afton's creations. Twisted Wolf, Twisted Freddy, Twisted Bonnie, and either Twisted Foxy or Twisted Chica are Afton's creations.  In other words, Henry built a monster.
I’m convinced that whatever Matpat says at this point determines what happens in the fnaf franchise. So yes, Gregory is a robot-
THE MOVIE ISNT EVEN OUT! CALM DOWN MAT!!
I have some other ideas which differ slightly from MatPats. Firstly, I think the scenes of Mike and the other security guard in the chair are of them being stuffed. The device with all the saws is obviously a Freddy head and as phone guy describes the insides of the suits in FNaF 1 “forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. That wouldn’t be so bad if the suits weren’t filled with crossbeams, wires and animatronic devices especially around the facial area”. Obviously the one in the movie is a lot more extreme but I personally don’t believe that it is a remnant extractor and I definitely don’t think that Scott would introduce that concept in the first movie.   Next, I don’t believe the Steve Raglan scenes have been tampered with or changed. He is definitely William Afton but as we know he has gone by other names in for example the books. I think that being a careers councillor is perfect for him as jobless people will come to him and he will then send them to Freddys like he does with Mike. He then rocks up and murders them, continuing his vicious cycle and because everyone believes that the animatronics are to blame, he gets away with it and is never even suspected.   Finally, I think that one of the big twists in the movie is that the animatronics have been trying to protect Abby and not ‘make her one of them’. From the games we know that the animatronics don’t normally go after children only after adults and the spirits don’t trust them, especially ones in security uniforms. Obviously 5 children disappearing in a weird pizzeria near particularly creepy animatronics will raise suspicion about them and thus making people believe that the animatronics had a hand in the murders and therefore making Vanessa think that the animatronics want to make all the other children like them. However, when William is discovered, I think that they will realise that the animatronics have been trying to save Abby, for example, trying to get her away from Freddy’s by getting her into a taxi and they will realise that the animatronics have also been trying to protect Abby from Mike and Vanessa as they don’t at all trust adults or employees.   These are just some thoughts that I have had about the movie for a while, I have no idea if these are going to turn out to be true or not but I am very excited to watch the movie when it comes out.
0:00 thank you Google meet
1. Vanessa could be revealed to be the mother of Vanessa from SC (so basically Vanessa Jr.) 2. The Nebraska thing could also mean that the movie takes place in a Fazbear location that’s in Nebraska. 3. Now I’m considering watching the movie.
My name is parker. lol
Did bro just call me el chipo
At the beginning did anyone hear Google meat
What if fnaf cant end until mat pat 100% solves the lore
If MatPat isn’t in this movie then I’m gonna be heavily disappointed
Has anyone else noticed that the 5th child in the field has a striped shirt? Similar to the striped shirt of the crying child? 15:05
there needs to be a fifth channel called fnaf theory
Or the twist could be that Abby is the mimic from Ruin, shapeshifting into Abby to fool Mike. Can’t wait for this movie I think it’s gonna be another good game to movie adaptation.
We all knew this Film Theory episode was coming.. 😏
Thank you for the video.
Hey Matt, pat have you ever seen the incredibly made Ghostbusters vs  nights at Freddy’s on Gt live. Just a suggestion. A HORROR THEORIST SUGGESTION.!! And cut
Love it
Aot vid
the movie is about to get canceled after this im calling it
If you never heard of FNaF then you probably are living under a rock
I’ve consumed every piece of fnaf content except the actual games and I can’t wait to watch this on October 27th
FNAF the ARG
How many times has MatPat SOLVED THIS FRANCHISE?
why would a kid have an instagram account
My theory is that the reason why so far we haven’t seen any connection with William and Mike is because maybe  Mrs Afton found out her husband was a maniac then divorced him to be with Mr Schmidt. William got so mad that as you put it steals Garrett to test on leaving Mike alone with no memory of his real dad until now
I mean the child has stripes on it, would that somehow link towards the muppet?
What is wrong with you
Hang on Mat, I think one of your pieces doesn't really fit the puzzle... The shirt of that fifth kid, it's striped, and who is the animatronic who is best known for their stripes? Marionette. Am I saying that you're wrong? No, but I kinda think my theory makes a little more sense. We might not have seen the Puppet yet, but there is a chance. I'm still piecing how the story would work out poetically in the Scotty fashion, but I honestly think that the kid isn't the Cupcake, but the Puppet. Hope the community sees this and runs my theory through the theorist machine!
These animatronics ain't gonna stand a chance against a hunger games survivor
The FNAF Film Theory take over has finally come
Why would he want to go to Nebraska💀
I think golden Freddy is probably Mike but in a later point in the movie and everything we are seeing in the trailers is like the beginning part of the movie
Can't wait for the video solving 2024 later this year
Bro in a month let’s go baby!!!
Oh boy
The one kid has brown stripes on his shirt. The cupcake has the stripes on the ‘paper’(?) and is brown. So that’s a fairly solid theory.
The fact that you have spoiled this movie... before it is even out is just.. insane
I think the kid with the top hat is golden freddy cuz the yellow colour sceme making the front kid freddy cuz the brown top
Petition to have game theory appear in some way in the movie
I hate italian cinemas and his strange delays.
I do think Matt is right about the idea that Golden Freddy is going to be a friendly character, but my vibe from the whole trailer and the ending is that Mike dies at the end of this movie and Abby begs the animatronics to give her brother a chance at life, causing him to become Golden Freddy. It would explain so much of the oddities of the story and also it would be brillaint to have the big twist be right in front of our eyes.
😀
Mabye Vanessa is lieing to mike and saying that the animatronics want to stuff Abey , when actually they want to protect her from “adults”/afton/Vanessa
I never skip sponsorships from Matpat, I pay more attention to them than I do in school Also, Google meet is really cool, I've been using it since I got a computer
the 5th kid kind looks like crying child because of the shirt.
THEORY ALERT! What if golden Freddy (Garett ) hung out with Abby Because He remembered her?! Mat pat Please see this
I always figured the reason they would be more friendly to Abby was that they only had agony/hatred for Afton (who was the nightguard)  And because Vanessa is a cop and Mike is the actual night guard they would be aggressive to them, but not the obviously not William Afton child
That mystery kid had on a striped shirt. Wouldn't that indicate they're more likely the Puppet and not Cupcake?
😱😱😱
Ok mat not to say your wrong but I think the might just be this in one of the books a girl gets picked up by spring Bonnie Ak I ALWAYS COME BACK anyways In the book there’s a button on the suit and the little kid press it and it makes the sprinp loke failure so my guess is that Abby is the kid and yeah and I think just maybe mike dose the die in the fire thing when he destroys all the animatronics setting  their souls free but after that mike starts a fire I know WHAT like a Fnaf 3 ending anyways with no exit mike dies or in the trailer Mike’s OK but Vanessa ummm not the same in the very end he always comes back AND William A turns in the Springtrap so I think the if there’s another movie it might be a prequel for Fnaf 2 or a sequel for Fnaf 3 but HEY THATS JUST A A FNAF GUESS thanks for reading
I swear he's actually in the movie and he just spoiled the movie for us with out us knowing. I love this guy so much.
MatPat I only recently learned of fnaf (last year) and I didn't know about it because I'm a 42 year old who about 7 years learned of yt and just last my friend @pumpkinking5609 told me of GT and then I started watching your fnaf videos
Bro its not even out 💀 Mat I really enjoy your videos
I’m surprised they didn’t save springbonnie/springtrap/William Afton for a second movie and just straight up put him in the end of the second trailer
i better see the bite of ‘83 and purple guy’s death in this movie. that’s all im expecting this movie to do.
And let's hope now that it's not a slasher type horror film, gory for the sake of being gory, and not scary at all like the Winnie the pooh horror film
Golden freddy has only one closers one only one soul in him for now
That's just a theory, a ga- film theory. Huh?
Matpat is the type of guy that can make a fnaf theory from a pic of freddy
You must have lvl 99 on Game Theory knowledge to understand a single thing in this video
Honestly the theory i was expecting, was a simple as "what does the movie says about the game"
Nothing we have seen before? wasn't the scooper a remnant extractor?
Like, Zoinks Scoob!!!  I think I’m the man behind the slaughter!
Can’t wait for the movie to come out and prove Mat Pat wrong some how
Matpat not getting a cameo is the biggest robbery known to mankind give him some respect
he really caught that kid garret lacking loll😹
its finally happened FNAF has a film theory video. cant wait for the food theory about FNAF pizza now lol
Bruh, it never even came out
I’ve seen all your videos.
Oh my-
I'd be actually shocked if MatPat wasn't in the movie itself   Well this aged well
My gamer let the movie come out first
god, i hope it makes the story of fnaf more clear.
Ok.
As a utahn I can confirm that the fnaf animatronics walk around the streets daily
springtrap be like [I am in your walls]
10:15  Did he just hint that he is phone guy? Or am I just haunted by theories?
No! Stop! Every time you make a theory Scot changes the lore!
Guys, he’s literally on his last straw (I think..?) 😭😭  He’s about to go insane and next thing you know there’s a purple guy IRL 😰😓
Well done Matpat now we could be disappointed with the final product
How many times has Mat “solved” Fnaf?
*Imagine if the movie came earlier in a month just like scott did with most of his games*
Big brain
Matpat finds the lore in stuff because we’re to lazy to
Mike Schmidt Abby Schmidt I don't know if these are fake names just like Dave Miller William or if Mrs.afron last name is Schmidt And that why Mike use that name and  didn't want to use his father's name because you know his dad was a murderer and he killed his brother already so Michael didn't want to be a murderer like his dad be seen as one like a Afton and I think Fazbear entertainment and Aunt Jane Jane Afton is going to be the villain and is going to be the one that owns Fazbear's entertainment and Jane afton going to be working with William to and Jane afton maybe is mrs. Afton sister? Late Jane afton Garrett Schmidt Clara Afton Schmidt or Clara Schmidt is Mrs Afton and Aunt Jane is like Aunt Jen or is Jane afton the sister of William Afton??? Aunt Jane is mike aunt.
The 5th kid has a stripy shirt, what if he is the puppet
If its flashbacks then maybe it's Billy afton but younger
Stripped shirt
I bet they’re gonna say “It’s been so long.” At least once in this movie 💀
Proof the fifth kid is cupcake, the stripes on his shirt match the cupcakes wrapper.
bro its not even out and bro solved it💀💀💀💀💀💀
If I had a nickel each time Matpat made a Fnaf theory about a person called Mike having a brother which is Golden Freddy, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot but its weird that it happened twice.
I think there will only be 3 movies, and I believe it’s supposed to be about the game trilogy, FNAF 1-3.  So the idea we would see circus baby would be cool, but at the same time, it wouldn’t fit.  Not to mention it would be hard to make a suit that looks like circus baby, and there’d be multiple face plates that would move on occasion.
Pov its not out yet:💀
So is the movie canceled now for a rewrite?
Oh yea, like when you solved the timeline?
I’ve been waiting for him to make a video on the fnaf movie. And now it’s here 😊
I’m the 267,052
Hyped to see Josh again
Universal Studios has the actual models that were supposedly used in the making of the movie! They looked so cool!!
Here's an idea A theory on where Death Battle going with their LORE
I knew it was gonna happen. I knew it
I’d really love for the twist to go in that direction!! Getting the Golden Freddy duo to happen would be sick for new viewers and og fans
Yes yay
I have the cookbook I got it at the book fair a few days ago
2:46 thats a scooper
That's it I'm pulling out the shotgun
speed
Idea: Matpat talked about a real life fnaf arg (I think), so maybe nebraska is where it is, and scott is giving us that hint because it's important to the lore? Just an idea
What about the Puppet?
Cool
Anagram is a bit of a strong word there.
I'm surprised no one's said it yet but crying child is definitely the one in golden Freddy because as we can see the one eye left is blue crying child's color and the other ear and eye is missing showing how cassaty is probably not in the golden Freddy suit
I wonder if, since the FNAF community is expecting William Afton to be the big bad, just like in the games, the movie will try to shock audiences by having him NOT be. He'll still be an antagonist and a killer, that's for sure, but I predict he won't be Springtrap - at least, not the Springtrap Mike will be facing. Instead, I think Mike's missing brother will be. Afton kidnapped Garret as a child and raised him to be a serial killer just like him. When Springtrap is defeated in this movie, his costume head will be removed to reveal a grown up Garret, while William Afton makes his get away to get chased down in the sequel
MATT PATT SHOULD DO A GAME THEORY ON DON’T STARVE TOGETHER!!!!!!!
Finally matpat will make a discussion theory of the FNAF movie
hmm... Remember that one thing from FNAF it might have been in security breach. They encouraged people to exercise and rewarded them with pizza.  How healthy/unhealthy is a pizzaplex pizza??  And could you use it to exercise successfully.  And for how long would that take for muscles to form?  There's a good Food Theory.
“I solved fnaf!” haven’t heard that line in years
The cupcake is Susie’s dog. Cmon Matpat
Five Night's at Freddy's is an unoriginal cashzm-grab riding off the global success of Willy's Wonderland! Shame!
Personally I think the crying child and garret grants character will be combined
I don't think this theory is entirely correct, simply because I think the golden freddy is actually gonna be Mike after he succumbs to the animatronics.
The brother being golden Freddy is also logical cus the brother got kidnapped, to a other place. And that’s why it needs to take a taxi. Makes sense , right?
Google meat
I thought that the 5th kid could be the puppet because of the stripes on his shirt, if they are introducing big hits from the fnaf series then the puppet is pretty significant to the lore
FNaF just won't die, will it?
Hi
Og gang 👇
I'm still amazed at how FNAF started out as a simple point-and-click horror game. To see it come this far is really impressive.
Only matpat solves a movie before it even comes out
Can’t wait for Scott to talk to Mat and say “it’s not that deep bro”
i was thinking that the saw death trap was a dream mike had, dreaming about all the mechanics in the suit if he were to be stuffed, like how phone guy says in one of the fnaf 1 phone calls.
what if the ghost kid in the striped shirt is puppet?
Mark is still missing 🙁
The fact that the 😈is purple is so perfect for the hint to Matthew Lillard’s real character
Hi
I'm a simple man. I see a sponsor on a youtube video, I dislike it and vow to never use that product.
Guys I have a bit of an idea, since it’s kinda believed that the first several games were just games, maybe the movie showcases the actual events that occurred in the Fnaf universe
Bro really just spoiled the whole movie before even watching it💀
I’m so angry this man didn’t get a part in the film. Almost every video did something just like this one: taught us about the series. Sure, Mark and Cory got it popular, but understanding the story seems much more important.
I never thought w would see fnaf on film theory but here it is 😅
IT DOESNT COME OUT FOR A MONTH WHAT
I died when I saw that google meet conference. Everybody 4k and Matpat on a potato :D
HAR HAR HARHAR HAR, Freddy singing his song.
Hear me out Kirby movie Chris Pratt
If fnaf was a subject, this man would be the best teacher.
Matpat sould do a fashion theory on the springlock suits
It's funny, Mat does the marketing for the FNAF movie so much better than anything Universal could ever wish for
You should do a theory on the among us fungle! The crewmates crash on a deserted island, live a jungle infested by mushrooms There might be some LOREEEEE haha the emergency meeting button is a shell Conch shell go brrrrrrrrrrr
No spolers please
I’m waiting for lore to come out around the fnaf merch so style theory gets involved and than Mattpat will find lore in food they’re going to sell at the eventual attraction
He solved the movie before it even came out
i'm due to give birth right on october 27th IM SO upset i have to see this movie
I already have Google meet
Ah yes. MatPat solving another thing before it even comes out. Classic.
That one kid being cupcake would actually make a lot of sense, his shirt has the same design as cupcakes candle
i was thinking the cupcake could’ve been Susie’s dog or something rather than another kid
18:00 so with this theory… there really will be a “spring lock scene” like all the memes have been assuming.  Awesome. Can’t wait to hear kids cry when it happens.
I think I guessed most of this from the original trailer Matt watched on GTlive (so it would be cool if my guess was used by matpat). Though i do wonder if Vanessa doesn't have a twist of her own.
Hm, interesting, seems likely, but I guess we’ll see if you’re right or not.
Saw someone point out that "Steve Raglin" is an anagram of "Everlasting" which is definitely evidence that its an alias
doesn't the 5 child look like crying child whoever that was
I feel like depicting all the theorist quarters living together as siblings, or something like that, stealing toys (theories) and annoying each other would actually work, and is really funny
Although there's no doubt William is going to be springlocked as we see in the night 5 minigame in FNaF 3, and based off of what we've seen it's implied that Mike is stuffed into the Golden Freddy suit by either the animatronics or by William himself.  As for "Baby" it's been borderline confirmed that this movie will be taking place in the original story (Pre-FNaF 4), thus making it impossible for Circus Baby to even be something or even a threat.  Vanessa probably just takes the same role as Phone Guy, guiding you through until meeting a terrible fate.
never thought id see the day when a fnaf vid on film theory
Matt, I think you've been a victim of the series for years
He’s the only guy on the internet who can solve an entire movie a month before it comes out
5:07 I dont have a theory or anything and im sure im wring but...what about the puppet? It was a very prominent character in the old fnaf games, and the kid is wearing a striped t-shirt. Just saying.
I miss the good old days when we were still hyped about security breach, about to release.
After so long of waiting it’s here
I thought chica’s cupcake was supposed to be her dog that’s why it attacks the guy like that yet again I guess your attack options as a cupcake are limited
Google Meet? Matpat is getting sponsored by everyone.
What if the mask is just a regular mask with the gears for the mouth going FAST!
I predicted the cupcake thing before he said it, oops
9:11
17:23 eyes are blue to symbolize sadness bc it was his own dad who murdered and kidnapped him
Bros spoiling the whole movie without it even being out 😂💀
The Nebraska poster could also be a way for the writer(s) to establish that this movie isn't connected to the games.  Disclaimer. My opinions below.     I'm also hoping for the scariness aspect of the movie that, they don't show too much of the animatronics. I feel like this movie could benefit from the terror of, "Not seeing what you're up against". Kinda like how it was in the first game. Because from how much we've been shown in the trailers. Some scenes which seemed good at first, now don't seem all that frightening or serious to me in some way. I think it's just how costume-like the animatronics look. I mean they look good. But they still look like cosplay costumes to me.
The last child could be the crying child i think that because he is wearing all Gray with stripes no accessories and doesn't look like the cupcake and mikes brother was kidnapped and most likely killed so there is my evidence for the last kid being the crying child and then of course turning into golden freddy
If you think that FNAF movie will have a happy ending, you need to replay fnaf
I saw a face in the machine parts
googel meat
What if they mentioned THE SIXTH SPIRIT… THE PUPPET
We should take this video with a grain of salt considering the movie isn't out yet
FNAF returns to take over the world!!
the 5th kid looks like it could be the puppit ik the pupits a girl but they might twist it
MatPat I love you but I can’t watch this yet! I wanna raw dog the movie as the kids say!
I have been flabbergasted
11:31 let the bodies hit the floor!!!!!!!!
I honestly expect there to be a Fnaf Movie for each location/game that we were introduced to including the RUIN DLC even tho it's just the same location but with a different rundown look
*sigh* there he goes, solving fnaf again
i think the last kid is the marionette with the striped shirt connecting to the stripped pattern
What if Abby is actually going to become the puppet? She has the striped shirt
"We're gonna solve this franchise" ..... Matpat you've been saying that for the past decade  You know this will never end
How is even go outside the pizzeria
Another fnaf epizode😍😂
There is no way bros solved the fnaf movie a month before it comes out
Bros solving stuff. Too. Fast
MatPat is the type of guy to have so much information about a game that he can guess what the ending of a movie about that game and get every single detail spot on without seeing any leaks (with the exception of trailers if you count a trailer as a leak)
Actually spirts can be in multiple places at once
5:07 it could also be that there's more than 1 freddy's pizza.
Lillard is ALWAYS a bad guy in the horror genre!!!!
This is the same matpat who said Mario bros movie was gonna be a musical 😂
mf got sponsored by google
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE ENDING BEING LIKE SILVER EYES' ENDING??? that would actually be so good considering we would see the springlock failure as well
How do you do this?! Absolutely incredible❤
I actually think the whole 'They want to make Abby an animatronic' is a misdirect. If remember in the Silver Eyes, the only main character that was a child in that book was a kid named Jason. At first they think that Jason is being attacked by the animatronics but it's revealed that they were trying to protect Jason from the 'adults'.   Just saying...
Dude  just solved the lore before it came out
yeah this is sum new
Missed the opportunity to say "it's been so long" at the beginning
I feel like him seeing the kids are just a hallucination, that fifth kid is the protagonists little brother that went missing, which would explain why the protagonist looks so shocked.
I kinda figured the last kid is the puppet, his shirt is striped and he's standing towards the front making him seem important
What if the blonde kid is the Puppet? Just because we didn't see it, it doesn't necesseraly mean it isn't there.
.
Took you long enough to solve it!
I'm about to buy matpat a ticket
This theory makes so much sense 😅
Awesome video, thanks❤❤
We haven’t even seen the movie yet so calm down mat pat
Guys is that Freddy 😰
has matpat done halo movies
I thought the blue eyed "golden" freddy animatronic was just mike possessing or somehow alive in that spare freddy "suit" or something-
So what I imagine the plot for the Fnaf film is, that our dude Mike gets hired as security guard and things start going weird. Leading to him having these bizarre dream that keep him going back to Freddy's. Where he tries finding out more about the restaurant and it's history. Meanwhile we get Flashback sequences, like with Afton and the Little girl hiding in the ball pit
That where I am, the best place of all, 4:44
Not even this channel is safe from FNAF .
everytime i hear this theroy i wonder why the "agony" machine thingy cant just be the scooper? all movie-ifyed idk if its somthing else
We were all waiting for FNAF to finally show its face on this channel
What if maybe the fifth kids turns into the puppet? Or maybe could be a crying child? His shirt has stripes on it just like the puppet and the crying child. If he was the cupcake won’t he have a pink shirt or something?
I'm spoiling it by watching this
I think the blonde kid IS golden Freddy cuz he closely resembles that one pic of Cassie. Even though we can’t see him in the trailer that well. Could be a coincidence
I was 25000
waiting on the inevitable FNAF weekend
You missed on the first trailer it shows springtrap, where in the 2nd trailer, it shows golden springbonnie
what if the twins aren't twins. and charlie is the mimic which is why afton kidnapped her
15:28 me: The Pupp- Mat: the Cupcake!! Me: ... ok?...
Was anyone else yelling Cassidy
MapPat i like this plot 👍
If the movie's gonna get pushed then it's canon.
Mat...What r u doing??
Man got spinners by google
I’ve been mostly on board, Until… you said Abby was gonna die. I think that part, as well as the whole fifth kid thing, are likely to be wrong.
🅱️illiam 🅱️afton
watch the hug from huluween
Ok, so we are going to see, maybe in the next film, how garret was trapped in the fnaf4 nightmares, and also, that is the awnser of how Mike can see the Kids souls and be that bad of a security guard
Now he can make fnaf lore videos on two channels!!!
يا زلمة بعده ما نزل
hidden lore by matpat   intro  lore explained   what is lore  how to lore  lore all over the world   lore continue
... I mean.. would Animatronic Suits count as fashion? Or even Michael Afton's... choice of fashion.. to appear "normal". Would probably make great Halloween episodes...
Given how Abby and golden Freddy are in the taxi together in the first trailer, I think Vanessa might just be wrong. I think the robots believe mike is William, and want to try to protect Abby. Similar to the silver eyes. I might be wrong though, just my opinion.
The beginning of the video didn’t scare me, but it was so frickin cool how Film Theory FINALLY gets a video discussing FNAF and it started off with a “Now it’s my turn” type feeling and I love it!
The Garrett is G. Freddy could also explain why the fifth child is a blonde.
5 kid is crying child for his clothes
Bro done solved the movie before it came out💀
... i keep saying this. at 2:25 this is probably some springlock suit or as you said a remnant extractor we both could be wrong though.  keep up the AMAZING work dude.
No 0:36 you did not and you did not 0:44 what…… yes 0:53
Nice.
If springtrap doesn't say "I always come back in a later" in a later movie I'm gonna lose it
Couldn’t the 5th kid (in the striped shirt) just be golden Freddy? And how would the security guard be Mike Afton yet his brother was kidnapped by William Afton?
1:18 A ... a decade ago.... I can feel my mortality creeping up on me
Who else noticed that the 5th child had the same shirt as the crying child
Now the real question is if the fnaf movie theories are gonna be here or on game theory
was that the slide of 87
“A video game movie based on FNAF! It’s great! All the subs to Film Theory, better get themselves ready for a heapin’ helping of Freddy when that movie rolls around…”  Game Theory: FNAF: We were wrong about the bite!  6 years later…. ITS FINALLY TIME!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻
Steve raglin is an anagram for every lasting
Not only that, but remember how in the silver eyes it turns out the animatronics purple trying to protect the teenagers maybe it’s like that in the movie?
This channel has finally graduated into the rank of a true theorist
bro it didn't even come out yet 😭
Matpat, im frankly surprised you never did a theory about The Amazing World Of Gum. From what I’ve seen there so much in in the show to make multiple episodes especially about the void
I may only know OF the game but I'm gonna check this movie out.
Is the striped shirt kid not the puppet?
This is cool and all but remember when he guessed how security breach was and then security breach got delayed and changed?  Bro the movie comes out next month please don't let this video be a reason the movie gets delayed or changed 😭😭😭😭
bro solved the movie before it even came out 💀💀💀💀💀💀
I think that the "Mike's dad" role is really mikes step dad or adopted dad
Too many matpat creepypasta I can only hear 'Google meat'
Matpat should make an fnaf week for all channels lol
Did you know that the kid that you thought was Mr. cupcake had a striped shirt just like Mr. cupcake himself?
Isn't Abby the name of a character in Fazbear Frights " To Be Beautiful"?
Hey atleast there no fnaf style/food theory 🎉😂
Imagine getting brutally murdered by a furry in a bunny suit just to become a cupcake
Matpat chill out dude the movie isn’t even out yet we don’t know for sure but loves the theory vid can’t wait to see how the movie goes 🎉
I can’t wait for the movie and MatPat to make another theory on it 😂❤
Ever since the first game came out when I was but a small thing, I have loved it to death, also my theory is that everyone who works on Fnaf watches game theory just to prove matpat wrong.
Can you make a theory of the Mario movie with the one character… Koopa General
I like how he said the fans from 2014 and the new ones but I’m from 2016
I want to be in the theater matpat is in when watching this movie
What’s new matpat makes a film theory about a movie that hasn’t even come out yet
har har har har
It feels so weird to say this, but I actually like the sponsor part of the video ( mainly just because there's no " oh, use my code for 5 billion 5 bucks And 20 skins🗣🗣🗣")
Omg this is my first time watching Film Theory
blud its not even out
THERE IS A FNAF MOVIE!?
Hey the boy has a striped shirt so maybe puppet?
I'm happy that most everyone on Team theorist has an android phone, like me. Idk why that makes me happy, but it does. 😂
5 nights 5 kids 5 animatronics But there's always 1 more That's FNAF
Back in the day everyone put jumpscapes in their videos when talking about scary series, including you. At some point you stopped and I really appreciated it as I could just listen to your theories and not worry about being blasted in my ears with spooky noises and visuals.... I am sad you've started putting them back in.
Matpat literally solved the lore before the movie came out. We all knew he would😂
15:16 the boy is wearing stripes, Just like the puppet...
I do not at all agree with cupcake theory, the fifth kid is an exact replica of crying child, I feel like matpat is overlooking that.  Similar hair color, same color shirt with the same color stripes, same color pants, and same color shoes.
I still hate you for the last film theory. >:(
Based on a FNAF tier list reaction on Distractible I also suspect that Markiplier plays the Phone Guy
I was waiting for this day for so long.
11:12 skip sponsorship
This is the actual best channel on here.
Matpat is just obsessed with fnaf, like Thinknoodles is obsessed with poppy playtime
Some one help my foot hurts
matt, do you lose sleep over this franchise?
I would like to see the theorizer and Matpat together and just see who has more insane theory’s 💀
The striped shirt doesn't suggest the puppet?
God let it come out first
I think i just watched the whole movie 😂
I used Google Meet then I see this vid
15:22 I think that the 5th child is more than likely golden freddy as he is wearing a striped shirt with blue pants much like our favorite unnamed bite victim the crying child. So I do think they are trying to retcon cassidy and the crying child into one character.
Week. 90. MATPAT. WEEK. 90, of asking for a spooky month theory.
11:11 ad finish 😅
i just cant anymore THE MOVIE ISNT EVEN OUT YET HOW
i think the 4 people breaking in could be a flashback with mike and his friends from fnaf 4 years after the bite and then one of them dies so they stoped talking to eachother.
mat pat will stay the whole credits memorizing name by name for a tiny easter egg
these ad-read lengths are getting ridiculous matpat
At this point they might as well have a 5th channel called FNaF Theory
Anyone else waiting for the Fazzgoo reveal to be the reason Michael Afton survived the scoop as he is not the original Michael, but rather a living goo zombie to be in the movie?
When I heard of that movie, all I could think was "will we get a cameo of our resident king of FNAF Markiplier and our resident FNAF lore master Mattpatt"? Seems like it'll be something for the second movie
Golden freddy being abby's and mike's brother Makes a lot of sense since Golden friday is the only one that seems to be nice to Abby, And we don't see any scenes of a trailer with Mike and golden Freddy together. Probably because then that would give away the twist
7:30 what if he is just playing as phone guy?
Cool, Google Meat... an image I didn't want in my head
I've literally been waiting for this video. I've checked to see if it's been posted every day since the trailer came out.
Bro got sponsored by google meet 💀
What if that child with the striped shirt could be the puppet or even the crying child because they both have striped shirts. While the puppet has stripes on their arms and legs, it could be like a big reveal in the movie maybe
Hmmm, that boy was wearing a striped shirt, and that cupcake paper wrapper thing could be striped.  Dang for a bunch of kids who get murdered, cup cake boy really drew the short lot.
2:30 i honestly agree with that
STOP RUINING FNAF STUFF BEFORE THE MOVIE COMES OUT BRO, You ruined the Ruin DLC for me
The movie is not even out yet!? CALM THE F DOWN PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF THE BITE OF 87!!!
Bro solved it a month before it’s released
14:16 You can see an Omaj to golden Freddy. The kid in the background in the golden T-shirt. It's like hes being forgotten By his friends.
Fnaf on all channels except style for now
It’s not even out yet, he’s just that good
12:00  I don't think Matpat is right about this because we've seen an unused scene where Max and Abby talk. The break-in probably happens midway through the movie.
Imagine if thy pulled a fnafvr as in this movie will be about how fazbear entertainment made a fnaf movie, and there may be a double plot, the plot of tht fnaf movie and the plot of the movie theater where the movie is showing
You had me believe the movie came out just to realize it’s the 19th of September 😂😂
9:32 pause
Bro just explained discord
Hey mattpad, Is it possible for you to to a fanf film crossover bewten the four channels? Like food can disconver they formula to enjoy the food during a full movie, and film theory could try giving the fullprouf plan to enjoy the best movie experience. Style theory could do something regard the most comfortable clothes for movie teathers or something, I dunno what game theory could cook up buut im sure fanf isn´t an issue there ;) stay healthy and happy!!
I personally think we need to dive deeper into the cupcake animatronic for all the answers to FNAF.
my theory is that the cupcake is the the soul of Susie's dog
what if mikes brother and that 5th random kid were stuffed in the same suit making them both golden freddy?
Bro be solving the fnaf movie before it's even iut
Mat is the type of guy to say he solved a movie a month before it comes out.
bro really turned into the definition of "im in your walls"
1hr AGOO LETS GOO
What is this the 7th time we have seen the word solved next to fnaf characters on a theorist video?
Btw the Fnaf movie was confirmed to take place in modern day, besides in flashbacks
Blud solved the movie before it even came out💀💀💀
Mat.... Can i call you that? You... Need to stop im- were all worried for you... Please stop this if not for yourself than.... For us?
Here me out fanf weak all the channels after the fnaf movie
And think this time Scott can’t just change it before release
MATT ITS AN ANIMATRONIC HEAD PLEASE 😭
No way google meet sponsored this video 😭
I was born in Utah
Chicoletta Freddy fabar
For style theory you could make a video on the theoretical possibility of a animotronic suit
Shaggy kidnapping kids.
Afton could be kidnapping Mike's brother after a divorce with Mike's mom  The "dad" casted could be Mike's stepdad, and afton comes to kidnap HIS ACTUAL child
Chica is literally Killer Queen from JoJo if that's the case if the cupcake acts like Sheer Heart Attack 😅 15:41
The intro got me thinking... Man i think matpat be creating clones of himself 3 main ones for his 3 other channels onw of wich is this one. And cuz film theory clone was interested in fnaf aswell and was jealous of normal matpat cuz he ia the only one theorising on fnaf he finally gets what he wants and the demons inside of him burst out resulting the jumpscare

Hu
Hold up what if, i am just saying, the actor who is cast as "mikes dad" plays a younger William Afton, because call me crazy Mathew lillard kinda looks like the actor for mikes dad
The 5th kid is obviously the crying child
AND HERE IT IS GAME THEORISTS!!  The video we've all been waiting for!! ☆☆☆☆
The 5th kid had a striped shirt, clearly he'll become the puppet
If hes the cupcake then where's edp
By god it's even infiltrated this channel
To be honest I gave up on the games a long time ago I don't think scott can make a cohesive story and should have just reset everything in a better way then help wanted and security breach. I only keep up with it in your videos hoping it might make sense again but I will say I look forward to the movie being a horror movie fan and blum house makes okay to pretty good movies. If it's a different story then the games I'm fine with that I understand different universes woth movies like sonic, mario or last of us I just hope it's good
A part of me wanted to guess something like the puppet cause of the kids stripes but it’s a dumb theory
If Mike Schmidt's real name being Mike Afton is canon is also canon in the movie, then we can also assume the following about the movie: Mike is William Afton's son. Matthew Lilliard has already been credited as William Afton and NOT Steve Raglan - the name we see him using in the trailer.  Mike has a twin/younger brother who was kidnapped at around age 5-8 (approx) and it's assumed that Afton is responsible for this, then Afton kidnapped his own son. Assuming Mike's brother was age 5-8 when kidnapped and was Mike's twin/younger brother, then that would put Mike at the same age frame at the time of his disappearance.  "Mike's dad" is played by another male actor who looks quite a bit younger than Matthew Lilliard and there is also a credit for "Young Mike" so I assume we see part of the flashback surrounding Mike's brother's disappearance through the eyes of Young Mike but also see a younger Mike's Dad in this scene, explaining why there are two different actors for the roles. Mike's parents are not present and I would guess they haven't been for quite some time now.  If Steve Raglan is actually William Afton like we assume and Afton is Mike's dad, we would assume Mike would recognise his dad, right? I think that after Afton kidnaps Mike's brother aka his own son, he goes under the radar and disappears from the family's life to avoid any suspicion that he was responsible. Mike was still only a young child himself when this incident happened and now appears to be in his mid-late twenties, so he may not remember much about his father in the first place if he also disappeared since the kidnapping which would explain why he does not recognise his father when he first meets him in his office as Steve Raglan.  I think part of the big finale in either this movie or the trilogy of movies in and of itself will be Mike discovering who Afton really is and that's how his inevitable hero arc grows throughout the trilogy.
Ofc, he solve it :) now I cant wait for part two in when he solve it again.
I hope the ending isn’t accurate tbh because there is too many horror movies with these Hollywood happy endings, a bad ending would be more interesting honestly
The time has come.  A FNAF Theory in Film Theory  What is life
You think MatPat’s done with his theories, but He ALWAYS COMES BACK
Monster Hunter can be covered by Game, Film, Food, and Style Theory. Surprised you haven't covered it yet.
only mat saying only 60!? you've made at least 2 tv seasons
My name is literally Garrett, just feels weird hearing it from the YouTuber that I watch.
Hey Matt, Afton wasn't the only father who dealt with the animatronics and lost a child to them. That's my theory  the other father is Henry if not younger Afton
0:59 I know it's a nitpick,but shouldn't native english speakers know that articles are important? it's THE Last Of Us
Can we just take a moment to acknowledge that this man got sponsored by GOOGLE?
I’m sorta early
Over a MONTH before it releases and we got THIS.  Appreciate the hussle, Matpat.
0:46 *_PIZZA RECIPE?!_* 😍😍😍
im not a massive fnaf fan, but id be lying if i said i wasnt at least a littble bit excited for this
If they delay the movie again because of your video, i SWEAR TO GOD!
What if the spirit possessing Chica's Cupcake is related to the child who posseses Chica? It could be her brother.
Mat pat chill we still wanna watch the movie
Who here is gonna cosplay during the movie im going as purple guy with a golden bonnie mask, flashlight, wrench and all.
MatPats made me immune to jump scares
IT DIDN'T EVEN COME OUT DUDE!
I know what the thing is is like one of the Freddy masks but when the old stuff in it yeah that's it
i feel bad for the body that was stuffed inside the cupcake
For style theory you could do a color theory video and just do case studies on the fnaf characters
It’s just repeating this fnaf cycle is never gonna end it’s been fnaf then other things then fnaf
Can't wait for the cookbook to come out so we also have to discuss FNAF on food theory & only Style Theory can run away.... for now
17:17 one of his eyes are there that means 1 soul is possessing golden freddy
I’m one of the first comments Les go pls pin I’ve never got pin ever
here come another delay
It’s a shame that it sounds like MatPat wasn’t given a cameo in the movie. I hope it’s just that Scott and Blumehouse want to give him a role in a later film. Also my main hope for the film is that it takes inspiration from the games and does it’s own thing.
I find the Nebraska thing both interesting and oddly funny as a Nebraskan- like yeah Mike we welcome you feel free to come here and escape Mr Afton's OSHA violations :)
Do you know what's hard? Google meet
In all honesty, my theory was MatPat was holding off on a theory because he was in the movie but hey. That was just a theory.
honestly Matthew Lillard playing as Afton would fit SO WELL. He just has that Aura to him that gives off William Afton, Especially in the graphic novels/comic books.
Everything make less and less sense
Why did he show and tell how many years you making me feel old😂😂😂 but yaaay🎉🎉new fnaf looooore
Abby accidentally stumbles in a clown outfit?"ACCIDENTLY STUMBLES"?! WHAT THE FU-
"This series exposed about a decade ago." Mat, you made me feel old...
come on matpat, did u not notice the striped shirt? ITS THE PUPPET!!!!!!
15:06 I feel like that’s the Crying Child cuz Look at the sweater and how it's stripped just like his. That or maybe it’s Cassidy? Heck maybe even the Puppet? 15:36 I heard someone say it’s Cindy's dog possessing the cupcake so maybe it’s that?
I'm betting Golden Freddy was buried in the woods, That's why we see him outside of the restaurant and in the taxi. My guess is that Abby has to return him to the restaurant because somehow doing so will break whatever control Afton has over the animatronics. leading to them turning on him and the traps getting sprung.
Mentioning that you now have 60 FNaF video on Game theory reminded me of the time you did a bit about being annoyed/angered at the idea of doing a 6th Pokemon video (on said 6th video..... collab with TheJWittz if I recall correctly).  Boy have things changed.
Finally… FILM THEORY IS HERE
Actually, Game Theory solves FNaF every 3rd Thursday of each month, like clockwork
😧it didn’t even come out yet
whats up with matpat and the novel trilogy, like every singular detail that might resemble or reference or even be remotely related to another detail from the novel, he has to point out  cmon man, give up on that novel, it wasnt popular and the stoy (stories) have gone a vastly different direction than than, besides character names literally nothing matches (and it was a story re-write to begin with)
not even a month away from release and it’s already been “solved”. i’m sure there’s going to be more lore in the 1h 50mins runtime so wouldn’t say that tbf
They are adding the bite of 83 In the movie so what about that🫤
Pls pin me I'm a fan Edit:I fixed the comment a lolbit
Hello Internet, welcome to fnaf theory!!
Aye. My friend is in this movie. He was also in Twisted Metal series.
this is a fever dream
my theory for the end is that they all gang william, william destroys the animatronics except golden freddy. and then willy boi gets springlocked
Leave to MatPat to solve the lore of a movie that hasn't even come out yet
Matpat:  [goes on twenty minute dialogue on what's going to happen in the movie based on trailer snippets.]  Me:  "PEETA!!!!  PEETA IS GONNA FIGHT IN THE HUNGER GAMES ONE LAST TIME!!  :D"
Ok nope this is not the same Vanessa from the games this takes place in the 90s and security breach takes place in the future if this were the same Vanessa she’d be dead I think
About time he did a theory about the movie
Hi
17:59 William Afton: I'm in your walls
has anyone noticed how weird freddy and friends look when compared to irl animatronics like chuck e cheese? like, their arms are segmented tubes of fabric, rather than a loose coat of fur etc? just a free idea for style theory
you madlad
Vanessa
bruh
Hey I have a theory for you if you didn’t hear in The fnaf movie trailer 1 maybe to Abby says daddy what do you think that is do you thinks she means William Afton I’m still wondering what If she saw him in the suit it might sound crazy but idk
For Style Theory I could see one about mascor suits being a thing. Maybe one about how springlocks would work? (I have no idea if they are an actual thing, or Scott made it up for Fnaf)
2:38 that’s a security guard being stuffed into a Freddy suit, mat pat. 🤣
Omg
Bro, I saw this trailer for the first time yesterday and this man already has a theory classic MatPat he sure does love his FNAF
Mike, Abby and animatronics: Yay! We did it! Go team! Animatronics: Oh, yeah.. you still gotta die.
👍
The pain in my soul when he said FNAF was released almost a decade ago 😭
What’s fnaf
Yeah matpat
I think that Mike might end up inside golden Freddy
Hold on a second... if that is what i think it is, that is genius : So the predicted ending would be springtrap rots in the walls x years. But isnt that what happened in fnaf 3 ? THAT SAYS TO HAPPEN IN 2023 ??? Movie and games dates would make sense somehow ? Thats up to Matpat to find out.  Good luck smart boi.
bruh it ain't even out yet 😭😭😭😭but good video though keep it up bro
What if Mike's Dad in this movie is Mike's Stepfather, because if I know the lore, William's Wife divorced him, and it's possible that the divorce gave Abby and Mike a stepfather. That's a lot of "if's" but I think I'm right actually.
Scott be sweating with this one
Fnaf
Style theory: do springlock suits actually work?
leave matpat to figure out the lore of a movie before it even comes out
Upon review, the fifth kid has a striped shirt and blue jeans. Y'know, the same as Crying Child?
matpat ive got one qusteion why is williams suit half witherd????
Maybe the last kid is the puppet, his shirt maybe makes some hints?
Just waiting until scott makes fnaf clothing with lore hidden in the seems lol
Isn’t the fifth kid kinda dressed like the puppet ?
the movie didnt even come out yet i didnt watch the video
Am I wrong or is the scooper look like a mask
I think Vanessa was added to be the sibling of one of the missing children possibly the kid who lives on as  Freddy or chica.
Yo wait were is the poppet
As much as I want to watch this video now? I’ll have to come back once October is over.😔
bro it aint come out yet calm yo jets
15:10 it could be the crying child because of the shirt
When FNAF end's so to does Matpat.
All your film predictions have a very sketchy track record for success, but this just might be the franchise you know well enough to actually predict from trailers
I’ll be back after the Fnaf movie, he’s probably gonna be right anyways
Bruh how does this man already have it figured out? The movie isn’t even out!💀💀💀
Matt you didn't realise Chika can throw her cupcake at you? That was a thing in FNAF 4 and Fnaf games after that that featured her. And I thought you knew Fnaf.
0:36 that got be meme
Cool to see google meets to sponsor this video. I’ve actually used it since for friends that didn’t have phones and I really loved and never had anything to complain about. I do miss the old emojis when they added google hangouts but it’s still great! Great theory though btw lol.
Matpat, please get some sleep 😂
Me:trying to not hear any spoilers matpat somehow 1 month before the movie:anyways that’s how the movie is gonna end
WELL….. there was an early scene, not with the actors, where Abby had a babysitter💀
E
im actually pretty sure the freddy saw trap is in a nightmare sequence
2:50 I thought this was a fun time animatronic
The animatronics faces in the meme is gold
i just think that scott made "sister" location for this movie
I used google meet a long time ago
My birthday was today, couldn’t ask for a better present other than a fnaf theory
I think Yep that Freddy torture device machine jigsaw is a immortal remnants souls agony live eternity Eternal life ect and Freddy torture device that is how they stuff people in suit William build the tortured Freddy killer device machine for Immortal remnants extractor and for stuffing people in a painful horrible way in the suit to so William experimented Immortal remnants on missing children his own family and himself on random people ect to make them all Immortal to see if William goal for wanting immortality works William had  to die and other has to die for them to become immortal remnants souls ect William other people had to die because he had to see if his goal would work if they become immortal and himself to.
Is it just me or did nobody know Matpat had a KID????
interesting
8 years💀
bro solved the fnaf movie before it relseaded
Bread
Matpat just couldn't help him self.
Huh.
I... was actually surrpised by this? I expect nothing less 🤣 Weve waited all these years and Im so glad Ive spent those with Game Theory too. Im so excited!
Matt are you gonna come to the Medina regal to watch it?
Perhaps Nebraska will be the second location.
My theory is that the animatronics are trying to protect Abby
How long did it take you to release that Mike Schmidt is the same actor as Petta Mellarck?
Instead of Mike’s brother being golden Freddy perhaps Mike is golden Freddy, do you think that’s possible
Dude I force myself to watch fnaf I love it
I started watching at 27 minutes
Broooo it’s not even out yet 😭
I’ve been waiting months for this
Are we sure the "remnant extractor" machine isn't just a freddy fazbear head, with Mike becoming Golden Freddy after getting stuffed in there?
As somebody that lives in Iowa, Nebraska is not a good place to escape to.
The movie is coming out on my birthday! 🥳😈
The trailer says that the animationics want to make Abby like them, but what if Vanessa and Mike are wrong and the spirits are trying to save and protect Abby from the same fate they had
I was looking forward to this! My only divergence from this theory, is that one of the “twists” is that the trailers are giving us yet another misdirection by Vanessa assuming the spirits want to make Abby “like them.” If their goal was to make more child spirits, surely Afton would just let them and have the cover story of quirky animatronics being the cause for missing children over the years. I think it may still be a little closer to the og in a sense that the twist is that the spirits are trying to protect Abby from the adults seeing as they know Springtrap in around and is a grown up that wears a uniform otherwise (security/police = potential threat) there’s no footage of them actively trying to hurt her, just to get to her, which is rightly frightening for a child to be chased, while all the adults are actively being attacked by spirits or Afton. As for Golden Freddy with the blue eye who will absolutely leave with Abby as a “happy ending” the other brother makes sense, but I was assuming Mike wouldn’t make it, get to hear directly from the spirits about what happened after dying and figure out he can still protect his sister like they were trying to do, and start heading to Nebraska. Afton will be temporarily dealt with (in a wall or what have you) but I think he’ll find a way out or go straight up rotting Springtrap “always comes back” style, because Abby and Vanessa got out, thus being the main villain continually for at least the first 3 films. But that’s just my trailer theory
I don't know if someone commented it already but with the striped shirt wouldn't that 5th child be crying child?
Matpat always having the theories so we don't have to make them up ourselves what a G.
Well that was quick
i always wondered if matt gets a portion of the profit from these fnaf projects. theorists in general are such a big reason why the games are so big in the first place. credit to matt
What if mike turns into golden Freddy?
HOW ITS NOT EVEN OUT HOLY [CENSORED] DUDE
The 'remnant extractor' looks an awful lot like Bonnie's face opened up... or is that just me? It looks like purple fuzz on the outside
I will hold you on this. You'll owe me.
FINALLY! Been waiting for this lol
I have never clicked on a video so fast
Blud already solved the movie before release 💀
btw why did billy boy Affton start kidnaping like WHAT THE KING DICE
MIKE AND VANESSA WILL HAVE A KISS SEEN BECAUSE ITS A MOVIE WITH IMPORTANT MALE AND FEMALE CHARACTER WHO ARE NOT RELATED!!!
I'm skipping this video "ONLY" because I don't wanna be spoiled on anything I will definitely come back after I see the movie
I always had the head cannon that the cupcake was the spirit of Chica's dog. Would be interesting if we ever got an answer to that.
A FNAF Film Theory video makes you realize that it’s actually happening, we’re really getting a FNAF movie 🥲
The last one of the kids is golden Freddy crying baby not Cassidy the shirt is the same Please see it
how- ITS NOT EVEN- your amazing :0
Also if you notice gold Freddy only has one eye, maybe Abby does die and possesses the other eye.
HOLLYWOOD! DO NOT GO BACK TO RE EDIT IT TO SURPRISE US! YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH SECURITY BREACH!!! LET MAT PAT BE RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just wait till the release. Then he's proven wrong
You know there is no doubt Matpat (99%) will be in this movie. There is no way Scott Cawthon will leave him out. The dedication he puts in theis FNAF lore videos are crazy he deserves a cameo
2:52 I’m pretty sure that looks like a suits head- you can see the lower jaw and upper jaw to the left. Idk lol 😂 looks like a blue, so maybe Bonnie?
FNAF, SAW but for kids.
I still don't think the idea that the animatronics are out to get Abby is correct. It feels, more likely, that they're trying to protect her. Maybe even warn her about Afton.  The only way I see them out to harm her specifically is if Afton turns out to be her father, with the animatronics seeking revenge through hurting her.
In halloween horror nights, didn’y they confirm that the puppet was gonan be in the fnaf movie
Wow
Its absolutely insane that all this is just from the trailers
This actually makes me wonder if Mike and Michael are 2 different people
LOVE THAT JUCIY, DELICIOUS GOOGLE MEAT!
I didn't think it was golden Freddy. I actually thought it was the cupcake 🤣 But something feels fishy and off. We're forgeting about someone/something...
Also I just they have the springlock suit failure scene and REALLY push the limits of the Pg 13
NEBRASKA?? I thought we were one of the forgotten states 😅
How did you solve it when it didn’t come out yet
Personally, whenever I watched the trailers and saw the kids in the forest I always thought that the kid in the brown striped shirt was freddy and the kid in the yellow shirt with the top hat was golden freddy but idk. Excited to see what's going to happen in the movie anyway :)
Just wait till he restarts every theory for the FNAF movie 😂
I think the fifth kid is the puppet
Keep telling yourself that nap time now old man hal (I don’t mean this in a mean way)
FNAF? On what chanell am I?
Everyone ignore the stripe shirts ?  And golden Freddy only having 1 eye( half the soul )
YO 6 DAYS AFTER MY BDAY?!? EPIC
I’m going to be very disappointed in the actors if there isn’t a blooper with Matthew Lillard dropping some important information and someone responding with ruh roh raggy
I forgot that fnaf movie's theory will not be posted on the game theorists channel so when I saw the red text I was like did he post on the wrong channel?
2:48 I hate that I followed that line to the tee
Bro has so many views in 1 hour. We need to find out the theory about that
Imagine being a literal cupcake after your horrible death LOL
“About a decade ago”  …
the thought of a kid being killed and getting his body stuffed inside a small cupcake animtronic is just edgy now 💀
15:40 You mean like The Twins in Dead By Daylight?
I know this is mostly unrelated to this video, but I'm really interested to see how similar it is to willys wonderland. There's already, a group of people break into the place and get killed by the animatronics, (though their reasoning seems to be different) and the local cop who knows the backstory of the restaurant and the animtronics who explains it all to the main character. I know these are different movies and the fnaf movie should not be compared to willys wonderland, but I want to do it anyway for a bit of fun. I'm not going to seriously claim these are the same movie just for some very small similarities
They all wanna make her like them but what if that’s not what golden Freddy wants what if he wants Abby to free them and that’s why HE befriended her specifically because the other ones don’t seem so nice to her  I don’t play fnaf I’m guessing based on trailer footage
It would've been so funny if Scott released the movie a month early just to mess with matpat
In a world filled with animatronics only MatPat can get insane because of them! And also I always use google meet to play games with my friends, I sadly didn’t get paid to say this ;( but it’s true :D
Explaining the whole solving the FNAF movie, I see the vision what Blumhouse is going for. If they are bringing key points from the novels and a bit of Security Breach, the sequel will be more likely to be a bit of the 2nd game, of course, and also a little bit of Sister Location if Abby does end up being Baby because of her name switch. I can be wrong though, but solid theory! I love it!  But if I were to be working on the third movie, if I was a filmmaker. I would love to have Eye in the Sky by Alan Parsons Project. it would be perfect for the centerfold to be around William Afton, the song meaning is different, but the lyrics fits so well with it.
The brown shirt kid is regular freddy and the boy in the yellow and top hat is Golden freddy am I the only one who thinks this??😭
Great... now they have one week to re-edit the whole movie just so it's not exactly what Matpat figured out...
So it, starts this is the beginning of many FNAF theories on film theory. Remember this day  friends
11:06
Anyone else get the same vibes from this as from the video solving Sister Location before it came out?
Bro I was in school when it came out
Film theory i have something or someone for you to talk about a guy named ink different you have to look for him like really look for him to find him but he has the lore if a life time please do it I have been trying to figure out the lore and I want you to also try and figure it out he also does cool animations and paintings so you should check him out  please edit I have a playlist of videos about his lore and it’s outdated but it has most of the lore
I'd be disappointed if you didn't milk this dry!
Let's face it, we've all been waiting for Matpat's FNAF movie theory. EVERYONE HAS BEEN WAITING.
So we just not gonna talk about how the fifth kid literally wears the same attire of the crying child?
Bro fnaf is so big that I'm doing my NHD project on it
LORE!!!!!!!
Waaaiiittt a second! If Mike IS confirmed to be Mike Afton... THEN SHOULDN'T THE GUY CASTED AS ''MIKE'S DAD'', BE WILLIAM AFTON?!?!
Matpat are you in the movie?
Ima be honest I haven’t played FNAF in like 3-4 years but MatPat slowly losing his sanity will never be amazing to me so I will always watch these FNAF theories as long as he makes them.
I just realized that fnaf takes place in Utah I live thre so that makes me so happy
So you're telling me that William Afton fit a child inside Chica's cupcake?
Ik I’m not the earliest but it’s always cool to be early enough to see the views go up
I'm really glad that the movie is going to be in a completely separate continuity than the games and books. I'm hopeful the movie will do something new with the story and take it in different directions, it's the best approach in my opinion. Streamlining it for general audiences is the right decision.
I can not want am it’s out on the when is when is broken I’m so excited I can’t wait to see it with my friends 😂😂😂😂
Matpat, I gotta give it to you. Your dedication to this franchise is impeccable. Thank you for your beloved theories over all these years.
Though that the creator of Andy's apple phone has released some new videos it was I think you might want to see it or hear It
Lol hilarious. 15:28
Garret Hines kinda looks like the dude we saw running before in the security uniform
Its not even out yetttttt
This is the first time I guest most of the things Mat brought up in his theory.
How is this the FIRST fnaf movie theory MatPat has made
ty don't need to see the movie anymore <3
this poor poor man is having his hopes high and on top until he'll realize the fnaf movie might not even be his theories and just ends up being completely different but hey thats just a theory A GA- i mean FILM THEORY
Love the midnight motorist easter egg
Ya just couldn't wait one month could you Matthew
ITS NOT EVEN OUT MATT  CHILL 💀
What if the 5th kid is the Marionette?
fnaf has now jumped channels!
Will you have at least cameo in the movie? Because if not, we'll riot.
ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET
Bro solved a movie that hasn’t came out
How does Matpat know everything
see if springlocks are possible for the style theory
I think Abby is actually only a chekovs smoking gun in the first movie. Cause it makes no sense for the gang to put  someone that young in a suit, maybe Mike or Vanessa but not Abby. Im thinking abby dissappears in the second movie in the later half and the third movie is where baby is introduced
NO . I DONT BEILVIE IT NO
It's not springtrap, it's just Afton in the spring Bonnie suit. Letting him be a career counselor during the day and murderer at night.
bro spoiled everything before the movie
Google Meet? Google Meet. Google Meet...
MatPat is the only guy that's able to spoil the whole movie before even watching it.
Do you think you solved it?
Just a side note for people to see. If you went to IMDB when the first trailers were coming out, Mathew Lillard was said to be playing "William Afton". It was changed just recently with the release of the final trailer. Also, William did leave and come back with a different name in the books, which is probably why he's called Steve now, it's his fake name.
Movie hasn't even came out and MatPat is already trying to solve it 😂
I've seen that song machine in people playground what it does is it's it has saws on one side and on the other side is part of an animatronic so they go through the saws into the animatronics
i’m not watching this because y’all are going to spoil it TT
Okay, I understand this movie is set in a different canon than the games, but what does that make the games canon? Because if we follow the second movie trailer, I assume Abby will be killed by William. But in the games canon, if Abby is Mike little sister and her name isn’t Elizabeth, than she’d be killed by Baby. Yes, that is a potential sequel, but it kind of contradicts the lines Elizabeth/Abby has in the start of sister location. “**Daddy**, why wont you let me play with her?” Well, if William is trapped in the walls, it wouldn’t make a whole lot of sense. Plus, if William isn’t her dad, then why would he have acess to the secrets of Baby? That would most likely mean Henry is actually their dad, no? Also, the “Mikes father” character could just be in a flashback, and the Job counselor is still mikes father. I don’t believe that to be true, but it is a possibility. Also, Evan died twice in the games. You told us that was a retcon and that he was originally meant to be puppet, but ended up golden Freddy. If that’s the case, he wouldn’t have been kidnapped, and that whole kidnapping scene might’ve been just a hallucination from mikes trauma of killing his brother. Where does cassidy even come into play with this? She’s supposed to be the one you should not have killed, but where is she in this movie? She plays a huge role in the franchise, why would she just be cut out? There has to be something amiss. Maybe something the trailers not showing? Plus, Cassidy is meant to be the one controlling golden Freddy. Cassidy doesn’t know Abby, let alone considers her someone that isn’t a threat. This movie is nowhere NEAR the canon of the games, so what are we trying to figure out here? The games canon or the movies canon? Sure, this could give us hints as to the games canon, but what would that really be. There no Cassidy in the movie, so one of the biggest mysteries in this franchise is not present in the movie. Really, what else is there? Evan/garrets actual name? These of course could be stand-ins, like in the last section of gumdrop angel, Hugo (or whatever his name was) was a stand-in, but that wouldn’t make tons of sense. What is there to take away from this movie and put it into the real mystery, solving FNAFs games? Also, there is literally no way Elizabeth wouldn’t be the daughter of William, meaning Mike and Evan also are canonically Williams sons. (P.S, where again did we come up with the name Elizabeth for Afton’s daughter? Like….?) CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG!
Something that not enough people talk about is how "Steve Raglin" is actually an anogram for "Everlasting"
Why did the intro sound like the “you wouldn’t download a car” song
Am I the only one who thinks the kid with the YELLOW HAT is golden Freddy and the kid with the BROWN SHIRT is freddy??
I thought the last remaining child might be the puppet cause the kid has stripes on his shirt, like the puppet.
OG FNAF fans here. 👇
I’m sure the fifth kid that matpat thinks is the cupcake, is actually the puppet, because there’s stripes on his shirt, just like the puppet’s arms
how did a kid get stuffed inside a cupcake??????
It's not even out yet lol
MatPats FNAF theories have been pretty acurate lately
A simple “hello?” Brought us all here…
god i wish i hadn't heard about fnaf till now.
What if Vanessa was a victim of afton but she survived and got away and now she has become a cop to be a sort of guardian angel to visitors to make sure it never happens to anyone else again
is the grinch his first name or his species name?
8 years for this movie and I don't think I'll be disappointed
WHAT HAPPENED TO CASSIDY 😢
Easy solution they can send you $10k+ in advance and your husband can hire a maid or nanny or whatever
Week 12 of asking for a owl house theory
Bros trying to solve unreleased movies 💀
bruh the little kids instagram comment is what brung the whole theory together i believe anything matpat says as of now
Please talk about dreams of a Insomniac its amazing
I think matpat is slowly going insane inside fnaf, I think we need to help him    What if mikes brother wasn’t actually kidnapped, but was actually bitten by fredbear, but just thought of it that way, what if mike has dissociative amnesia, it’s when you can’t remember certain events because it was traumatic, and mike made up a story of him being kidnapped instead of killed, it’s crazy but I still kind of having a point
If I am right, Abby stands for Elizabeth. That means she’s probably Elizabeth. As for Garret, it men’s bravery, which Crying child is. That’s the connection I think.
This comes out three days after my birthday and may I just say it’s the best birthday gift even if it wasn’t supposed to be one.
I love my Google meat
Maybe mike,abby and the other brother are in fact williams kids, whose probably, after a divorce with his wife, seoarated from him. And mikes father actor is some sort of distorsioned memory.
the fifth kid is freddy - he has a brown shirt, the one behind Mike is Golden Freddy as he has the top hat and gold shirt-- Chicas Cupcake HAS ALWAYS been sentient as extension of chica
I think the name Steve Raglin is used for the more casual viewers of this movie so that the reveal that his name is William Afton is a surprise, but for us hardcore fans it’s more of a “uh oh, Mike is talking to the purple guy without knowing it uh oh what’s gonna happen??”
IM EARLYYYYYY
please do a theory on welcome to Dreamworld it's a really cool series
The kid u said that could be inside chicas cupcakes couldn't it be golden freddy? he had a striped shirt like the crying child plus golden freddy has two spirits
For stile theory u cold talk about the spring lock sutes I mean u can where them and some people are still confused on what they are and how they work
no they think you are a endo
For stile theory u cold talk about the spring lock sutes I mean u can where them and some people are still confused on what they are and how they work
This is speculative, but I genuinely think what's gonna separate the Movie continuity from the games/movies is that I think Michael actually dies in the movie, but he becomes the second spirit that possesses Golden Freddy alongside Garrett, which makes so much sense as to why Golden Freddy LEAVES with Abby, and the rest stay.   Sus that Michael is nowhere to be found when Golden Freddy has been shown. SO maybe Michael did get closure after all by being with his brother and seeing him one last time.
We knew this day would come
Of course
The last kid could be the puppet
I’ve been waiting for this video for so long
think your good mattpat? try this on for size, Guess MARKIPLIERS role in the MOVIE as it was confrimed he is in the Movie by Markiplier himself.
Guys imagine in the fnaf cookbook we will find out how to make the crying child an how to make Carl cupcake
discord is better but alright
we need to take a moment of respect for the death of matpat`s sanity thinking so hard to put stuff togethor
Google Meet is the sponsor? Lol what
plz don’t
Matpat doesn’t know he could’ve done a style theory about fnaf long long ago because of the Spring suit.
Finally he posts something other than a GT live on the movie, kept us waiting over a month
And it ain't even out yet...
This sounds so real I feel like there should be a spoiler alert at the start xD
14:51 I kinda interpreted the five kids in the forest scene a little different. Naturally, Bunny Ears = Bonnie, Orange Shirt with the Hook = Foxy, and All Yellow = Chica, but I saw Brown Shirt Boy as Freddie, with His brown shirt like Freddy’s fur, and is kinda standing in the front like the leader (much like Freddy), and Top Hat Boy as Golden Freddy, because if you look close enough, it kinda looks like he is wearing a yellow striped shirt and has yellow on his hat, and he is in the back/hidden behind Mike’s head (like how Golden Freddy is more reclusive than the other animatronics).  That being said, I do like the theory of Garrett being Golden Freddy, and as always, another great FNAF theory video from Matpat!
THE MOVIE COMES OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is just a recap of everything most people already know about since other YouTubers have talked about it such as William afton changing his name after the murders
Would been early but I was watching your death note and Aot videos lol
I work at universal and have been showing my bosses your videos to explain why i think this film will do better than they expect. May have converted some 😊
do a roblox myth vid day 2
instead of start ling the video with matpat saying “it’s been so many years” he should have said “it’s been soooo loooong” 🎶🎶🎶🎶
Is weiard seeing a fnaf theory on film theory like rain going up
Bro is smarter than most college students
Finally I xan make the blob spaghetti
I thought he said the sponsor is google meat
now they gonna switch up the story a month before the release cause pat pat solved the movie 😭
What if the 5 kid is the puppet
Hey matpat which one will you cover spider man 2 🕷️ or Mario Bros wonder 🍄
I honestly think this movie is going to pull a “Luke, I am you father” type of moment for this movie.
2:50 did he just use “Remnant” and “Agony” interchangeably?
Okay everyone chime in, do you think these pre-release video have any effect of the video itself. Do you think the studio would edit the video after this.
I’m the 200k viewer!
Lets hope that its more accurate than last vid
Bro solves things before they come out
I was watching this with my sister and realized the 5th boy might not be cupcake, but crying child. When she pointed this out, I noticed the striped shirt... idk, but maybe.
Mat pat: trueley the animatronics have taken another victim   Me;yeah you
Is it weird I want to see and Hear Matpat rant during the online meetings?
11:05 skip add
I say we call the remant thing “the mangler”
“This kid is the cupcake” BRO THE SHIRT IS RIGHT THERE IF ITS NOT GOLDEN FREDDY ITS THE PUPPET
Matpat should have got a role in the movie as a cameo.
You said 3 FNAF Movies so here are the Movie Titles.  1) FNAF 2) FNAF Sister Location (Because they spend the movie trying to find the location of his sister and name of on of the games. 3) FNAF Security Breach. (I believe this one will be focused on The Blob, with a hopeful cameo by MUSIC MAN. It may also be called Ruined.) But hey that's just a Theory a Film Theory.
noot noot
You gotta make another game theory on splatoon there's been too much lore since splatoon 1's release!
Very Impressive Work There
I think William will get spring locked and then presumed dead only for him to come back in the 2nd movie
Anyone just start randomly singing songs they heard on the internet                                                                                                          If so me too
Sweet sweet mat pat and crew fnaf lore is like  trying to untangle a rope that's connected at both ends while it's only getting more tangled  and the guide books on fire and so is the rope.
The fifth kid might be a cupcake, but I assumed he was the puppet, given the striped shirt.
15:22 what if that kids the puppet or the crying child due to striped shirt
Can't wait to come back here after watching the movie❤
i miss FNaF, i’m just not excited for anything in the franchise anymore. in 2017 i would’ve been happy to hear about the movie, but i don’t care anymore. so maybe it’s just me, but the whole franchise doesn’t feel like it used to.
8:03 also, William Afton is a sort of devil, and the emoji that is used is purple. But hey, that’s just a thing that you missed, a probably unimportant thing you missed. Aaaaaannnnnnndddddd cut!
HOW? IT’S A MONTH LEFT. IT’S A MONTH, A MONTH. HOW?!! THERE’S LIKE THREE TRAILERS WITH SOME SCENES THAT’S EVEN IDENTICAL TO THE OTHER TRAILERS. EXPLAIN!!!!
Here is a theory what if Gregory from security breach is the killer machine. In the tapes in security breach it said something about therapy people going missing what if those people are the kids and Gregory aka the mystery killer machine and that is how the bodies are stuffed into the suits.
Look at the hair of the kid he said was the cupcake, then look at the photo of Charlie with the same hair. that has to be golden Freddy
I honestly like Apple devices more
What if that fifth kid does have a characteristic like the others, that points to which character they are? They're wearing a stripey top, who else is stripey in FNAF?
Game theory I think I know who is the other kid I think it's crying kid
Cool fredd
Honestly I’m kinda hoping by the time scott ends the movie they would’ve opened the box by the end
I predict Mike and Vanessa will end up falling in love because they work together to stop Will. I believe that William will kidnap one of Vanessa’s close family members and force her to work for him, and she’ll be happy that William “dies” in the suit, and eventually kiss Mike. Also for build up, maybe they’re sitting and talking and are about to kiss but Abby interrupts them to talk about the yellow rabbit drawing, similar to in blue beetle where he almost kissed h the girl but got interrupted
I feel like the animatronics adding abby to the band is a red herring. It seems way to obvious especially when they just tell us. And how would Vanessa know that's what they're trying to do?
Actually, it’s nine years old I was born in the same month is for fnaf one and I’m nine
I do think that Mr. Cupcake having a soul is possible, but I think it’s also possible for the spirits to do random things. The fridge made random events and the Freddy spirit was somehow visible and out of their suit to lure a robber. So Susie being across both Chica and Mr. Cupcake couldn’t be too big a deal, especially since Mr. Cupcake is also separately mobile in FNAF 4 and Help Wanted.
Bro can't help spoiling things for himself
The editing in these videos is so good
Wait the movie isn’t out yet
At this point there's no coming from the lore! It's over Matpats brain plz send help to him🙏
bro it didnt even come out yet and bro found the lore🥲🥲
I’m pretty sure Cupcake is remotely controlled by the Chica animatronic and therefore Chica’s soul would be able to control both. It’s implied by Nightmare Chica’s behavior, Chica’s parts and service in FNaF VR, and how it only ever moves when Chica is nearby. It would be good for performances and counterintuitive to do it the other way
I love how ironically Fnaf has media for everyone of his channels 🤣🤣
Matpat has really gone real far from the beginnings now, and it's really impressive even having Google try and get promoted by him and the team real impressive ngl.
I think that golden fready is mike
Oh no, Matpats going insane… again!! Edit: also, I know a lot of people who came from Nebraska to Utah. Keep in mind I’ve been in Utah my whole life. So I’m not surprised if Scott is trying to throw us off again. Edit 2: I forgot.. again.. to say that matpat should play cult of the lamb or phasmophobia. There’s a bunch more lore they added to phasmophobia, and cult of the lamb is literally a game made of lore
I hope you see what I see
They're gonna reshoot the fnaf movie now 💀
Ye 3AM is a perfect time to watch a video about horror <3
I always knew this day would come
Matpat found a way to put FNAF on this channel as well. What's next theories about the Pizza and how it was made?  Or fashion on what materials they used to make the spring suits and/or animatronics?  (Okay, I'm basically giving him ideas at this point.)
Matpat is my local insane man, i love it tbh
We all knew this video was coming also mat pat are you going to be in the five nights at freddys movie and if you aren’t I’m not watching it
It's a spooky poopy 💩 (spoopy).lol it can only b a spoopy if it's a spooky poopy. My daughter says she spoopied when she gets scared by something scary.
Remember that MattPat has a habit of being wrong.
Ferdy fartbear
Day 2 of asking matpatt to do terraria
You know you've become a big youtuber when Google sponsors you
15:06 MATPAT THAT IS CLEARLY GABRIEL I THOUGHT YIU WOULD KNOW THIS THE SHIRT IS BROWN WHILE THE ONE YOU SAID POSSESSED FREDDY IS WEARING YELLOW.. SHY MIST EVERYONE SAY THIS
y dose google meat have 2 do with the spred of fnaf theorisz
Film theory has been invaded.
It's entirely possible that the movie was moved to Nebraska because the government for the state of Utah doesn't want a horror movie associated with their state.
It’s a striped shirt
MatPat does theories about movies before they come out. MatPat does theories about FNAF games before they come out. Why did I not think this was inevitable? Also, MatPat better make a cameo in the movie. Or at least a reference to “theories”.
Man, i sure do hope that matpat doesn't completely figure out the story, and they decide to change the script, and we have to wait years until the movie comes out
Matpat:Makes this video Scott: Welp, time to rewrite the script again
Under 1hr
Thought the striped shirt kid would be GF or the puppet
now watch BlumHouse remake the whole movie because of this guy, never happened before fr fr
He always haves a good intro
MattPat tries to solve FNAF on Film Theorist once and for all, something MattPat of the Game Theorist-Universe could never do, no matter how hard he tried and how close he might´ve got. even the Theorists have their own Multiverse spanning battle.
I really  love  your  video
Its been so long since we’ve last seen this
Everybody comment matpat is a goat
i love matpat BUT IT AIN'T EVEN COME OUT YETTT
Time for the sweet, sweet springlock failure scene
maybe ... just maybe... im not gonna watch this video before movie releases... im sorry i dont trust that intro
God bless Matpat and how many hours he's sacrificed for FNAF lore alone
Tell me, How does one “solve” a movie?
A fnaf video on FILM THEORY!? this is truly revolutionary.
Before 1 hour gang👇
I think the fifth kid is going to be the puppet
56 mins no notification
BRING BACK THE THEME SONG!! BRUNG BACK THE THEME SONG!!!  DO YOU HEAR THE THEORISTS SING? SINGING THE SONG OF MAD THEORISTS!!! IT IS THE PLEA THAT WE WILL ONE DAY HEAR THE GT THEME AGAIN!! WHEN THE FIVE NIGHTS FILM COMES OUT, WHEN THE NEW FNAF THEORY IS MADE, THERE WILL BE MUSIC IN YOUR EARS WITH THE GT THEME!!!!  That was me reaching out to the theatre kid in you matpat, listen to reason!!!!!
Plus its pg-13!
we already knew lillard was playing afton its not a shock its on imdb and got confirmed months ago
Matpat, if YouTube goes down hill you always will have a future as an  English teacher!
god
matpat got sponsored by GOOGLE
The fifth kid could be the puppet since it has a striped shirt. Just throwing that out there
I just realized this is the first fnaf video posted on this channel 💀
15:05 Matpat may I point out the striped shirt and the one major FNAF 1 animatronic not talked about
Of course you did
Can’t wait for Scott to absolutely clown matpat again
Considering the Puppet and Balloon Boy have both been cast for the movie, I seriously doubt that this will be the only location we see. Ryetoast also put out a great theory about this movie that works pretty well with this one, where Mike is captured by Springtrap and taken to a different location -  a location with the Puppet and Balloon Boy. Then, Abby has to convince the animatronics (and Golden Freddy) to follow them. Either the Puppet frees Mike and the others catch Springtrap or the others free Mike and Puppet catches Springtrap, either one.
Looking forward to seeing the movie! I am disappointed though that Mike isn't likely going to be Micheal Afton, to me personally, that point made the FNaF games feel impactful, because of Mike trying to right his father's wrongs.
And so the age of fnaf on this channel begins
You should make a theory on CoryxKenshins Edward Norton story
blud it ain't out yet tf?
under an hour gang
i personally think that the ghost child with the stripped shirt might be the puppet and we might get a puppet cameo regardless of the teasers
All right, two things 1: i’m so happy to see the original cupcake finally catch a body after all these years. 2: these animatronics, even though it’s been said already enough look fantastic.
Touch grass 😭
Matt I think the fifth child might be crying child look at the shirts
I’m am HYPE fro this mivie
Bro so humble forgot to mention he can time travel
thx
I have avoided this franchise until late 2022 only because i thought the animatronic were to scary. side note I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WERE DEAD KIDS INSIDE OF THE SUITS UNTIL MY FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT THE FRANCHISE IN LATE 2022 SO I WAS JUST SCARED OF THE DESIGN OF THE ANIMATRONIC! 1:11
And so the age of fnaf on this channel begans
1:16  MatPat wants to detox with FNAF, it’s getting bad
The video starts here I think lol. 11:12
And so it begins on this channel
uh oh not another prediction
55 minutes ago 😌👏   🥲 I was eating dinner-
He’s getting scooped
Matpat just pulled a Markiplier 3 scary games intro
also I have a question matpat, do you think Bonnie is blue or purple
Really, here we go again!
I keep forgetting that FNaF takes place in Utah. As a Utahn resident I am terrified :)
What would the style theorist intro look like
Golden Freddy being Mike's brother is great for interpreting the "it's me" message associated with him
I mean  the fifth child could also be the puppet, and that’s why the child has stripes
RAISE RIGGY and btw matpat are you going to see the fnaf movie
Hey matpat why don't you make a video threoy on live to discuss with your fans to share our theories about fnaf I hope you read it
Its gonna be terrible 😭😭
I'm still mad everyone is so confused about the missing children the boy with the *brown shirt* has to be for the *brown animatronic* why is that so confusing to everyone but me? and before you all reply "but MatPat said" tell me this..who else wears a tophat? the only other bear there and i'm serious that scene where the kid with the Brown Shirt is the one who lures someone to the Brown Bear Animatronic for MatPats favorite jumpscare is no accident and he must know it too he's not that clueless..what do you guys think, MatPat easter egg in the movie or just being clueless?
So this confirms it the movie will be a film theory
Dont forget: I ALWAYS COME BACK 😈
Coryxkenshin?
Pin me pls
Fnaf, eventually it’s gonna take over style theory.
POV Blum house/Scottcauthon:gaw dang it he just spoiled da movie
I still think we are long overdue for the video where matpat describes how to survive fnaf, like his hunger games video
Dosent matpat have a cameo in the movie?
Why am I always early? 😭
Maybe William Afton would win the fight between the animatronics but their souls make him springlocked
Get fnaffed
15:15 the kid is also wearing a brown striped shirt which looks like the cupcakes wrapper, didn’t think of that honestly.
Another channel for MatPat to go insane over 😂
Could always be the puppet
You should just make a FNAF Theory channel at this point
I wish they were still british
Josh Hutcherson 💛
Yay google meet the thing I used during 2020 for school
Oh no lol get it yikes. 8:39
Google meat..noooo
Blud the movie ain’t even out.
You're gonna get Lucas in trouble with the producers, calling him out like that...
Uhh spoiler alert guys lol
Blendering the plot also means that in case this is the only fnaf movie they ever do; they still manage to pull major and minor plot points from different aspects of the series but still maybeeee one day have enough left for a sequel
Fnaf is a haunted series, and it haunts MatPat 💀
May mats social life rip since this movie comes out soon  and he will have to watch it on gt live pls mat pls we beg for you to watch it live
Matpat can see in the future now?
Did this son of a theory god just predict the entire fnaf movie. AND MAY BE RIGHT?!?!?!?!?!?!?
GOOGLE MEET SPONSORSHIP?????
mat waited for this day 10000 years
LOL the Matt Pat jump scare got me in the intro LOL great insight
Its not even out bro chil💀💀
I cant wait for the movie
Then it’s changed after pt2
Maybe the fifth kid isn't the cupcake but the puppet
The mystery kids shirt reminds me of the marionette
I have a friend that only want to see the movie because of the gore. I keep telling them to look up some lore 😭
Matpat definitely has a board connected to red dots with pieces of FNAF lore on every dot.
I’ve been a fan since FNAF1 and I’m ashamed to admit I didn’t notice Abby is just Baby swapped around until this exact moment😳
I really don’t like how the film might make the animatronics want to attack Abby, I prefer just the idea of them attacking all of the people.  Anyone else agree
Matt ignoring that Dawko's Matthew Lillard casting call literally said "William Afton" just shows how far he's fallen. Also, Steve Raglan is a cover name, like Dave Miller from the books. It's a disguise for Afton.
😭Whyyyyyyyy dose this have to happen going to be their last projjjjjjeeeeect😭 it's Scott cawthon last project 😭
Its funny because matpat was already in a fnaf movie before
The PNG of Abby with the pasted-on cartoon eyes and mouth make her look like a monkey to me, sorry.
Under 1 hour gang!
IT HASN’T EVEN CAME OUT AND YOU ALREADY SOLVED IT?!
15:06 if he's right about the kid than they made the bad decision of having him wear a striped shirt like the crying child. That's the first thing that came to mind tbh
Poor matpat, he can't rest😭
The stripes on his shirt!!! Clearly puppet
If i watch this video, i'll get spoilers 😭
Let's go
My bet is puppet.
I do actually have high hopes for this movie, as it’s production is much more separate from any ways it might be messed with. One of the main reasons Security Breach was so broken was Cawthon changing things all the time, but given his more limited knowledge of filmmaking, I’m pretty sure Blumhouse will have an easier time keeping things on track.
we all knew that when the fnaf movie trailers dropped he would make a theory
I have a different theory as to who the fifth child in the striped shirt was, what if yes it is Chica's cupcake, but before that he was the Puppet, after all the stripes do match up. But with Puppet no longer nearby or otherwise unavailable, the restless spirit latched onto the next best thing, the Cupcake of the first child to get the axe and stuffed into a suit the one who saw it all. It's the best I can come up with.
How can a kid fit in a cupcake?
FNAF: MatPat's Alpha and Omega.
Even before the movie comes out, you still got to solve it don't you Mat Pat?
I’m the 2.1k comment 🎉🎉
i dunno if this is worth mentioning or not, but the fifth kid's clothes looks like the crying child's clothes, just with long sleeves and long pants instead. as well as blonde hair, maybe I'm lookin too far into it. great video though! i always find your theories to be really good and well thought out!
If the 2nd move come out i will realy like to see the puppet
I love that you try to look for theories from other perspectives and don't settle for what is supposed to have already been discovered. Your theories are always very interesting because they make you think. It reminds me of the old days of FNAF and I love it!
Matpat: "I've solved fnaf!" Us: "Oh, again?"         "Are you sure about that?"       *ALL the other theories about fnaf made by matpat* "Ah, look, another one's joining us"
it didn't even come out and bro's making theories 💀
Is fnaf
It's not even out man!
This is a good theory I always thought that Mike would die to springtrap and possess golden Freddy but if this happens too then it would be like the original lore of golden Freddie being possessed by two spirits so cool
I think the Fnaf movies are just another way for Scott Cawthon to mess with matt
Imagine being brutally murdered by a man in a golden bunny suit and while your friends get to possess beloved animatronic creatures, you possess a fjucking c u p c a k e
Oooooooo very scary
All I hope for is that this film ends with afton getting spring locked after being cornered by Mike, Vanessa and the spirits
That fifth kid does have a striped shirt
Still so happy that this game takes place in my state.
I really hope if we get decayed springtrap they do proper gore like game springtrap
Clam your i was here early ticket here  👇
Wood hoow Nebraska!…cool
Didn't watch the theory yet because I want to be surprised by the movie, but coming back to see how close or not close it got. See you in 2 months o7
Loved the video but remember the reference to Scott coffin being assigned to help the store images rebrand? What if this the rebrand?
Cosplaying as William (Purple guy) Any tips!
I don't know why we're trusting Vanessa when she says the animatronics want to make Abby like them. What if the twist is that Vanessa isn't the ally Mike thinks she is?
Google Meet = School
okay now the other kid i believe to be the puppet and i basically think yes chica can soul move i mean hey the cupcake is connected to chica so ya including the stripes on the other kid shirt the puppet got stripes but we don't know yet the puppet might be a boy or a girl but yes i am 100% sure that the kid in the car is his brother and that brother is golden freddy which will make sense with her and golden freddy coryxkenshin taxi scene
Yo, I think he officially lost it
"acts under a pseudo-nim" Matpat man what is a "pseudo-nim"
Makes sense
Omg tnx
When I heard matpat say remnant extractor, I saw the gtlive reaction to trailer 2, NOT THE FINAL TRAILER, I decided to put this comment out: REMNANT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️
“Oh my sweet stars what have I done” YES WHAT HAVE U DONE THAT IS HORRIFYING THAT IS SCARIER THEN FNAF ITS SELF (am scared of Bonnie the most in fnaf oh hey me ans Scott have smt in common that is grea- NOT
I like to think MatPat knows the true plot off the FNAF film, because he is in the film.  And if he is not I will not be surprised, but I will feel disappointed in the missed opportunity.
its an animatronic's head
The game that made Madpat a lot of money from Game Theory and now on Film Theory.
Theorists now back in the gane of trying to figure out if ccs name is Even, Smitt or new commer to the ring Garrett
Thanks for google meet for sponsoring this video💀    JK Great Video
Whatever happens in the movie i think we are all interested for the popcorn bucket!
I'll say the line.. "Mat you finally lost it"
He can talk about the games on game theory The movie here The shadow kitchen Freddy’s pizza on Food Theory And the merch or something on Style Theory Truly, nowhere is safe from Fnaf theories
Wait cassidy is the cupcake
YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS
code red fnaf took over the internet and movies
Stripes on a shirt and you don’t see a puppet cameo?
I’m just waiting for Scott to launch a fashion line so mattpatt can theorise on style theory about it
As a long time fan of matpats FNAF theories, I have to say this is the first one I flat out disagree with. No disrespect though! Enjoyed watching it! I just think the movie (like the books) isn't going to be as cohesive as this and is going to create more questions than answers. I think it's possible we've been acting under the wrong assumption and Mike Schmidt isn't related to Afton or I think we might be looking at robot people again. I'm unconvinced about the blank ghost kid being the cupcake and I think we are focusing on the wrong kid. His face is clearly visible in the first trailer at least but there's another kid whos obscured, the one everyone's connecting to Freddy. I think the visible blank kid is regular Freddy and the obscured one is golden Freddy. What that means for the franchise, idk. But I think if there's anything to learn from this series, it's that no one FNAF entry can stand alone. It's gonna give us a lot of dangling threads that maybe line up in other parts of the franchise and it'll complete it's own narrative that probably won't feel satisfying. But again, no disrespect and I'm probably wrong too.
Mat your head will explode 1 day
I thought that the fifth kid might be the puppet because of the striped shirt but it could be anything
FINALLY A FNAF ON FILM THEORY
Yay matpat theory
Okay, but the Golden Freddy with Abby part is so wholesome
Nice finding the loophole on to theorize the fnaf *LOOORE* on film theory😂
honestly that scary  masking looking thing reminds me of the bad ending when they stuff you in the suit if you fail
I assumed that Vanessa's line about the animatronics trying to turn Abby into one of them was a lie or a misunderstanding or otherwise false.  Usually (especially in early fnaf), the robots are only aggressive to adults. They don't want to hurt other kids the way they were; they want to protect them.  Also, I just don't trust Vanessa, idk why, just seems like she has too much convenient information
Can matpat just go to the biggest theater in America and we true theorists go watch the movie with him?! 😁 pleaseeeeeee
Ok but think about it, FNAF 3 takes place in 2023 and the movie is coming out this year
50 MINUTES
Matpat is a genius 🤣
I think Gold Freddy will take him down but will not savive 🔪😦😧🫣😟😢👻🐻🦊🐰🐥 the fifth kid is the puppet
I think Gold Freddy will take him down but will not savive 🔪😦😧🫣😟😢👻🐻🦊🐰🐥 the fifth kid is the puppet
I think Gold Freddy will take him down but will not savive 🔪😦😧🫣😟😢👻🐻🦊🐰🐥 the fifth kid is the puppet
Or maybe MatPat is pulling some kind of bait and swtich here because he is a part of the movie.
The kid is not cupcake his shirt is striped so crying child
is this a reupload
I feel like this should have been released a few days before the movie comes out, so they don't try to change anything.
11:12 sponsorship ends
Matpat's ability to come up with theories never ceases to amaze me.
3rd movie comes out sometime in 2025 according to google
0:16 it begins 😱😎😈🥳
My guess is, that "remnant extractor" is really just a failed spring locks suit, notice how it is also a mask?
Broyhill Albert Einstein brain
Yay
MatPat can you please make a theory on Emesis Blue? Also, I love your videos.
No way… haha… and yet Scott and blumhouse never thought it would be possible…
Why it feel like film theory gets more screen time than game theory
Sir, please acknowledge that 1989 is also releasing on October 27. Its a big day for us fnaf theorists/swifies
I'm not entirely sure but the kid in the woods that people think is golden Freddy could also be the puppet because of the stripped shirt or the crying child because he has a stripped shirt too.
Biggest plot twist would be matpat in the movie. Imagine hes been playing us this whole time.
watch him change it as soon as it comes out
We'll guys... Time to rewrite the movie.
One question is olly your editor....  Cuz in that case, does he work for anyone else? Maybe a certain yter mexican..?
THE FNAF MOVIE ISN’T OUT YET HOW HAVE YOU SOLVED IT ALREADY
I might be spitballing here but I think that 5th kid might be the puppet because of his shirt
OR golden freddy has a blue because he is possesed by Sans from UNDERTALE!!!!!!!!
I’m sad we most likely won’t see the puppet in this movie 😢
hi
FINALLY YES
BRO how much does mat stay awake just researching?? the crazier part is that THE MOVIE ISNT EVEN OUT YET. 😭this man needs to sit down and relax with a good ol cup of coffee
its gonna end with the taxi scene and mikes haunting golden freddy
At the start, it was a missed opportunity to do Its been so long :(
To be honest I kind of hope they keep mike as just a normal guy instead of an Afton just seems too confusing and kind of weird like why would he work at his dads restaurant it wouldn’t he recognized the career counselor the missing kid story u know?
The movie's working title was "Bad cupcake" so i think you are correct.
Matpat uploads chad music intensifies
This sounds like a nightmare on elm Street but with more killers
The movie could still happen in Nebraska. The original Fnaf restaurant was probably Utah, they then had more locations created in states and Nebraska is one of them. Also this is takes places in another universe.
Counter offer: the 5th kid is wearing stripes, and while we haven't seen them in these trailers, there is a fnaf character who is fond of stripes.
As an avid consumer (emphasis on consumer) of Game Theory,  I found it actually hilarious hearing Mat toning down the amount of info he was giving about Fnaf itself and him explaining it to first timers. At this point, we have gone so far into the rabbit hole (pun intended) that this feels so "Once upon a time..." to me.
Bro calm down ! The movie isnt even out yet AND THERES ALREADY SOLVED VIDEO ABOUT IT ??? How ?!?? What size is your brain ? (Pliz in centimeter me europe)
they're  probly gonna change  the script  after they discover this theory  lol
Knowing the game lore that Micheal Afton was Mike Shmit, the line “I will take *anything*” is intended on his side to sound desperate, but in actuality is him just wanting to get literally any job for Freddy fazbears pizza, to get inside the restaurant
at around 15:36 Matpat says the child is not closely related to a animatronic but look at his shirt his meant to be the puppet  i understand the puppet is mean to be a  girl but look  at the shirt its the same pattern So i  hope matpat see this ands fixes his theory a little
Mom MatPat is being delusional again where is the "afton is a gud guy theory" to silence him ?
Game Theory cameo on Film Theory
oct 20 is the release of the new blink-182 album, 27 is the new fnaf movie, i have a play im doing on the 28, and my BIRTHDAY IS RIGHT SROUND THERE
ONG YK HOW GARRET SAID HES A LOT NICER THAN HIS CHARACTER? WHAT IF HE PLAYS FOXYBRO?! AFTER ALL FOXY BRO LOOKED DIFFERENTLY FROM MIKE
EVERYONE WAKE UP, HE'S FINALLY DONE IT!
Soul in a cupcake kinda dumb. But I like the rest of it lol.
Style theory: which fandoms merch is most likely to make you friends in the wild
imma be honest i feel like the machine that mat keeps calling a remanant extractor is just blumhouses way of showing the guard getting stuffed into a suit cause u can see its a freddy head and inside an animatronic im guessing they would need gears and stuff to work idk its just what i thought it was anyway
So when is the FNAF food theory?
Is that Freddy Fazbear hor hor hor hor hor
i think golden freddy is just mike. after he dies then saves his sister as an animatronic. which is why we only see golden freddy looking back at freddys and then driving away from freddys. its the ending. and they are leaving.
OwO
Would be funny if the movie was suddenly delayed after this video
Imagine that the whole movie either gets canceled or they have to remake the whole movie over again because of Mat Pat
The only gripe i have with this movie is i wish the kids were more dead looking
Here before 200k views
Fnaf has spread
Amazing! Noticed some inconsistencies and contradictions though.
In a decoder his name means everlasting 7:09
Wait is there not going to be a casidy ????
I love Matpat but l’ll watch this video after the movie drops man 😭😭
Matt pat, how do you stuff a child in a 1 foot maybe less cupcake ?
I don't know if it's more insane that he is trying to solve it before it's out or that he got a Google Meet sponsorship.
2,061st comment tee hee
I saw this thumbnail and immediately let out a sigh of "Oh No.."
Start a war in the replies section for no reason.
I imagine MatPat curled up into a ball rocking back and forth murmuring FNaF lore pieces to himself.
15:31 actually mat pat, the kid has a brown shirt, which would be Freddy, and the kid in the hat is golden Freddy (not because of the hat, but because the kid is also wearing yellow) sure Garrett could be golden Freddy, but then again, in the books, there were 2 spirits inside of golden Freddy, so, brown shirt kid is Freddy, and kid yellow jacket or coat with a hat is golden Freddy
I also have a theory, what if Steve/William is Mike’s dad and the “Mike’s dad” character is actually his step dad and William left to go get the milk before he was born
Can the last child be the puppet? From his shirt, it looks like the puppets main color
13:15 I know this was meant to be a joke, but theres a BIG chance they watched your videos to get a decent understanding of the lore.
my son birth day is on oct 26
it hasn't even come out yet- How?!?
MatPat, you should realy do an ARG between how your channels get some beef and you can make a whole Theory beef ARG. Likfor excample: Game theory gets realy mad at film theory and food theory and style theory can join the beef too. 😂❤
I just hope the FNAF Movie has Music Man in it.
15:06 Honestly for the theory with Cupcake Kid, I thought MatPat would make the detail connection.  AKA, the fact that the kid is wearing thin striped shirt. Similar to the thin stripes on the Cupcake's wrapper. Sure the kid's is horizontal while the Cupcake's wrapper is vertical, it still seems like a good way to connect the two.  On the other hand it could be argued that the kid will be a secondary soul in Golden Freddy since it's golden stripes on a brown shirt. Golden decal on a brown base.  Either way, details can make or break anything in FNAF.
ITS NOT EVEN OUT 😂
That fifth child has both the color of Golden Freddy/Fredbear and lines in his shirt. Maybe its a parallel to both?
Supporting the cupcake theory, his brown & stripy shirt could represent the ‘cup’ of the cake (or the candle), and the bowl cut is reminiscent of the cupcake’s overall round head-icing-eyes thing. The only thing we can know for sure is that the cupcake being sentient will be absolutely hilarious.
no comment on how abby's voice sounds exactly like balloon boy's?
hi
IT HASN'T EVEN COME OUT YET HOW DID YOU DO THAT 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This needs a spoiler warning 😂😂
MatPat, stop trying to make Baby happen, it's not gonna happen.   Mostly good theory actually, probably because it actually does make a lot of sense, the pieces are fairly obviously leading you one way and they can't change how it ends to mess with you this time.  And yeah, okay... I actually think this is one of those times calling Baby makes sense. I'll give you that.
Oh dam am decently early
how do you even get sponsored by google what
Theory: The reason Mike attacked the guy and the kid screamed "Daddy!" is because he thought the dad was kidnapping someone
YAY!!!! LESSSSSGOOOOO!!!! FNAF IN NEBRASKA!!!!!!
The saw x and paw patrol double feature is crazy
THE SAW FREDDY MASK MAKES PERFECT SENCE WITH THE CLUE GAME AND THE MASK BEING A WEPON THEY'VE TESED THIS SINCE BOARD GAMES
Coming out on my birthday let’s goooooo
Bro made a theroty more than a month before the movie came out lol matpat doing matpat things
The easiest way not to hear anything about FNAF is to unsubscribe from Game Theory. The guy who runs that channel is unhealthily obsessed with it.  Don't tell him I said that.
Bro imagine a movie writer saw this and matpat was completely right😅😅
Honestly knowing that matpat isn’t gonna be in this movie makes me not want to watch it
Very interesting, though I honestly hope Matpat isn't completely right. It'd be fun to see some surprises and I'd like it if they didn't nearly completely copy the Silver eyes
is it possible that the 5th kid DOES have a link to an animatronic? striped shirt? puppet? just spitballing
clearly this isnt in the same universe as the games because mike has a yongersister who is alive, ether he isnt Michael or the Afton's family is different in movie
We are getting 3 movies of Shaggy Afton, God is real.
Motion for Matpat to make a Fashion Theory around the IRL costumes masks and the bite of 83 ones
we think the same minds, i thought the exact same thing for most of your theory
What if Scott Cawthon set this all up this way just to give everyone something to chew on
It lurks in the shadows, out of His spotlight, His view. He dances on the stage, weaving a web of lies. But you must venture beyond the cage, and find where It cries. Find the truth.
So William isn't Mike's dad? Weird
imagine if by some crazy twist thmovies confirm sister location takes place before the bite of 87 and Id's Fantasy was complely right. Matt would not have a good day.
2:52  It’s the Anti-Scooper!
Man the movie isn't even out
....and MatPat continues his slow descent into madness...
Next up, food theory shows you how to make Chica's cupcake by using the official FNAF cookbook, as well as answering the question, what does FNAF pizza taste like?
He did NOT call golden Freddy “golden Fredbear”
44 min gang ↓
Pffft, it's been long enough.
It's always a good day when Film Theory uploads. W-wait, i-is that Fnaf?
Matpat's leaving out the most crucial twist. The post credits scene where he comes to the crime scene and is like "I've got a theory..."
Why would the animatronics want to take another kid? As far as we know they've always been vengeful towards adults and the only time the puppet has "given life" has been when the kids were already dead. (Unless that's the direction they take? BUM BUM BUM! I choose to believe Abby is already dead, no I will not take any questions.)  It would just be a strange decision to make them aggressive towards another kid.
But I always come back
🎉
Twist Ending:  the movie's actual title is SAW XI
A fnaf cookbook you say? And the movie release? I say yes.
If my math is right then fnaf is 8 years old
IT'S NOT EVEN OCTOBER, HOW HAVE YOU ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT!?!?!
Matpat's theory sounds great actually. Having Abby become Baby at the end and tease her as the villain for the sequel would definitely make me excited. I hope the movie is good and makes enough money for them to actually complete the trilogy.
12:14 in pretty sure we see Mike with them in the trailer so I’m not sure but Cool theory love ya Matt pat
Calling it now. The kid MatPat says will be the cupcake is actually the Puppet.   He has a striped shirt. Who has stripes? The Puppet.
Matpat what if Mike's parents are divorced and his brother is leaving with his mom?
I’ve been watching MATPAT for a whole week now waiting for a new episode only to find out about fnaf movie😂
The fifth kid Matt talked about has a striped shirt so I think it could be the puppet
I aware Google meet of all sponsors sounds just so random but what ever
15:23 Tryhardninja was right... It's bad cupcake
Watch as an upcoming FNAF book immediately changes everything
Oh no 0:47
At 9:42 MatPat confessed he tried to use other services besides Google Meet, this means, at some point, Google Meet didn't attend to their necessities somehow. I believe the plot of this sponsor is that Google Meet started as a bad service, but then turned into a better one, so good that made all other services bad from his point of view. BUT REMEMBER, THIS IS JUST A THEORY, A SPONSOR THEORY, THANKS FOR READING. (I know you read with his voice... Even if I typed it, I'm still reading with his voice as well).
sad that markiplier isnt it the movie
15:14   I would be very surprised if this were the case, the boy being the cupcake. I would like to think that he is the second child possessing Gold Freddy. If it is the cupcake, I could see the 5th child being Chicas older Brother.
Oh lord. He’s started
MATPAT PLEASE WATCH ANIMATOR VS. ANIMATION 1-6 AND MAKE A THEORY ON ANIMATOR VS ANIMATION 6 PART 2 PLEASE IT WOULD BE AWESOME
I wish you had a show on Netflix I would binge it
For the cupcake thing, keep in mind that during the chika repair game in the vr game, the cupcake runs from you and hops around on its own
MATPAT NOOOOOO
Lol!!!!
finally
Yes, a Matpat FNAF Movie theory. It's weird to think that at one point it seemed this movie wasn't going to happen. Glad it is though! I'm gonna be watching it on the first day!  Does anyone know if the tickets are out yet?
W video Mathew Patrick
Fnaf came so far
Fnaf:Never let them know your next move   Matpat: I can predict the story of the new Fnaf movie.
the fact that the fnaf movie was first announced on my birthday was the best gift i receive from scott, can't wait for it, thankyou scott.
Could the striped shirt kid could be the puppet?
I’m a goofy goober
can you make a theory about melanie martinez
15:30 The Cupcake moves around in the games, too, but there's never been any proof it has a spirit. The kid might actually be the Crying Child. He has a striped shirt, so that seems plausible.
fnaf is slowly taking over all the channels… maybe its glitch trap taking over..
The films not even out yet and matpats already making theories 😂
MAKE A FIONNA AND CAKE THEORY OR I SWEAR TO GOD AM GONNA H-
Nuh uh
I still think mike will be mike Afton.   His mother devoiced afton and took mike and his brother away and had abby like a few years later. But good ol afton kills the parents and kidnap the brother.
Hiii🎉🎉🎉😂😂
nuh uh
har har har har har har har har har har. har har har har. har har har har. 🐻 🎩🎤
When you've been in the weeds as long you have, you forget just how insane this series has gotten until the man who guided you into those weeds starts talking about the series in a way the casuals can understand.
Does anyone else got the feeling Matpat has an ARG cooking in the background
I can't man, matpat just keeps going and surprising everyone
Bet this'll age like the richest of milks
The films not even out yet and matpats already making theories 😂
Early!
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
We sued Google Meet in high school when we went home for COVID in 2020, I think im good on that topic 😅
Hahahahahahaaha! Good joke Mat Pat; solving FNaF.
Plot twist Cassidy was the cupcake all along
Hi
0:50 I bought a Freddy hat from comicon a few months ago, so it’s already too late
2:45 a remnant extractor would be good for a story, but I don’t think they’ll take it that far. I personally think that’s the movie’s way of showing someone being stuffed into a suit with the robot parts inside. That way, it allows for simplicity and it stays true to the very first game.
HELP 😭
I dont to be rude Matpat but...the movie has not come yet and started making theroy but I love you matpat keep the videos up. 😂😂
Great video 👍
For the remenent extracting device it can also be an interpretation of the scope from sis location
It happened people, Fnaf finally made it to Film Theory, I’m so proud
:D
YES! A NEW VID!
I FREAKING CALLED IT
FOR THE THIRD TIME! THE GHOST KIDS ARE ALL 5 ANIMATRONICS. From left to right: Bonnie (bunny ears), Freddy (BROWN SHIRT),  Foxy (red shirt and hook), Golden Freddy (Hidden until Mike moves like from the first game hidden until the rare chance that he pops up in front of you, plus he has hints of yellow in his shirt), and Chica (girl dressed in yellow)
2025 fnaf2 2036fnaf5
Its not even out yet
Am I the only one going to see this movie because of matpat videos
You can count on matpat to read to much into the smallest details
15:34 the cupcake is named CARL
Very interested in this theory
Always a good day when we get FNAF LORREEEE
Omg 40 minutes
Im honestly really looking forward to this film 😆
My only hope is for a Mr. Hippo end credits talking about the disappointment of waiting for something that didn't happen
:/
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSS
The spirit kid partially obscured behind Mike has to be golden freddy if any of them are. Why would the spirit possesing freddy be partially obscured? Its never been. Which has though? Golden freddy, every single time we see golden freddy's grave its partially obscured, hidden just out of view.
going to guess here. in the 3rd fnaf movie its going to be revealed mikes going to be the one who was kidnapped as a kid and he's a robot like charlie in the books
Obviously Golden Freddy would be Mike's Brother, that's literally one of the only things confirmed in the franchise.
Finally, someone not thinking Mike and Abby are Aftons! I had broken down the trailers based on costuming and had be able to create the five nights.  The vandals, containing Abby's babysitter, raid the place on the day of night three, the same night Mike brings Abby to work.  Abby's only there for three nights.
My hope the silver eyes twisted ones and the fourth closet getting their own film is dying more painfully than the missing kids because matpats usually right. But it may come back in a few years I wanna see how it’s explained through film
Matpat is really incredible!?!
The real struggle is do I watch it now or wait until after I see the movie so I can experience it like a fresh little baby of this new, cinematic fnaf lore
I love when he does fnaf❤
1:13 - How? Never a fan of horror games in general, and games like this never really appealed to me. Not to mention when the game first got released I was still in Middle school and barely had time to even consider surfing the internet.  That's how.
Idk how matpat missed Springtrap having half his body covered in spots (holes?) In some shots
Only matpat has the ability to find the lore of the movie before it releases lol
Am I the only one ho thinks that the ghost spirit with the top hat looks yellow that makes me think he’s golden freddy and the kid with the brown shirt is Freddy just saying not hating 😅
springlock scene! springlock scene! springlock scene!
I feel like those drawings on the wall that you mentioned earlier in the video were changed in the trailer as to not reveal anything too big, they could possibly be different in the actual movie
Imagine william afton stuffing a kid in a robot cupcake
I always love the theories that come out before the movies or games release, so I can return and see what changed
Nice
Remember if we had just chosen Slenderman Matpat would still have his sanity
Thanks for helping
Claim your “Within an hour” ticket
8:18 YES CALLED IT!!!!!🎉🎉
Fnaf on Game theory AND Film Theory? nice
Bro solved the movie before it released💀
I do think that doing a Style Theory on the mechanics of Willy's Springlock suits would be interesting, but I really hope that Mat doesn't try to actually make one. That could get messy
claim a early ticket here!!!
Oh hey matpat has somehow become even more mentally compromised because of Fnaf
Who thinks Dylan O'Brien would have played such a good mike. Not to say the actor who is playing him is bad but I feel like Dylan would play the roll so goooood he is such a good actor and have been in movies like "maze runner".   Who agrees?  👇
Honestly although I do like to know that it has a sad ending I don’t really care that It does because fnaf is fnaf after all
Mike a word of advice from a local Nebraskan… stay in Utah pal. The Mormons are better then literal miles of corn stalks (and potentially stalkers)
I'm offended you dare to post on a TUESDAY!!!
I thought five nights at Freddys take place in the UK
About time he’s doing a theory about the upcoming FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY movie!!!
THE FACT THAT THE FNAF MOVIE COMES OUT LIKE RIGHT AFTER MY BIRTHDAY>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>   {AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH}
Bear news : the five nights at Freddy’s movie delayed 6 years do to a guy on YouTube with no life solving he story before it releases , the channel name you ask , Film Theory
Wait untill its out and than break your sanity
It’s a good day when you see that Mat Pat uploaded a fnaf video on film theory
Bro spoiled the movie💀
wasssaaaaaapppp
You can always count on Matpat for overthinking everything 👍
Aah, the first FNAF Film Theory. How long I've waited
Hey so I think the 5th kid actually looks a lot like the vengeful spirit in UCN.
yes  yes yes yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Do you not remember what happened to the security breach
bro solved it before it was made
How can afton put a child in a cupcake?😭
15:26 i think that kid is the puppet cuz of the striped shirt
That kid he mentioned is probably the crying child. His shirt reminds me of that kid.
Bro got sponsored by Google 💀
Bro mat has put more effort in fnaf lore than his own life 💀💀💀💀
“Film Theory: I Solved the Fnaf Movie”  You said the same thing about the games and yet here we are.
Honestly I can imagine Golden Freddy fighting Springtrap
bro didn't spoil the movie he  narrated it
Im betting the post credit scene is either Elizabeth getting scooped or maybe a police investigation that leads to something saying hey where is the creepy bunny suit
Mattpatt Just keep beating the dead horse that is fnaf and won’t leave it alone till he find out all it secrets.
If Abby gets got, that could lead to the similar-to-game occurrence where there are 2 spirits in the Golden Freddy…. If the cupcake theory ends up being wrong.   Also, looks like golden Freddy only has one eye lit up… maybe there’s something here?  I think I’d prefer that to the cupcake theory. Please.
the day is finally here F.N.A.F meets film theory
The fifth kid with a stripe shirt is the puppet.
Matpat you've done it again!
Well, in the novels William Afton has taken fake names, so Steve Ragalin could be a cover identity like Dave Miller in the Silver Eyes.
Does it confirm that Mike isn’t Michael Afton?
Here We Go again. I'm so excited!
Yed
"I solved the FNAF Movie!" Its not even out yet... Stop the clickbait
And they all lived Happily Ever Afton
Am I the only one who thinks that the top hat kid MatPat said was Freddy is Golden Freddy and the mysterious/cupcake one is Freddy? I mean, they are all seemingly color coded, and the whites and yellows that the top hat kid is wearing fit much more to Golden Freddy rather than Freddy. At the same time, the mysterious kid just happens to be wearing a brown shirt, same color as Freddy. Also cupcake being haunted by a separate soul sounds like a very lame and pointless twist.
Bro iw getting promotions from google he is the promo G O D
Matt pat you cannot be a sequel for the movie because this is five nights at Freddy‘s last project
no wonder the series is so mysterious, I’ve never heard or met or known a mf from Utah  Shaggy in there tho so I hope he says “Like, I was the man behind the slaughter man”
The movie: didn't come out yet Matt: hold my diet coke *makes a "I solved theory"*
The FNaF weekend crossover it's coming and you ALL know.
FNAF has consumed his life so much, it has invaded Film Theory.
The kid has a striped shirt. It's the puppet.
YES THE VIDEO WE ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!!! Like genuinely half way thru I completely forgot that I was watching a Film Theory episode and not Game Theory!  Now Style Theory and Food Theory must now join the FNAF family...
Finally we got the fnaf film theory video.
So proud that Film Theory finally had its fnaf theory that we’ve been waiting
So it's saw but magic?
I just want it to be as dark as the og games...
The cupcake? Really? I thought that thing was just there for props.
Well I hope that Mike Schmidt is Michael Acton and William is his dad in this as it would be a bit pointless to change that after setting it up all these years
Lads mat pat is the fricking goat I mean bro has devoted his life to making us feel better about this FNAF movie. Yo but I mean it, keep up the good theory work
It was only a matter of time till FNAF came to Film Theory
Please no more FNAF :c
Why wouldn’t MatPat tell us the whole FNAF movie lore before it comes out?
a the sweet smell of channel domination by fnaf
“Hello internet! Welcome to Film theory!” Loved that part.
IS MIKE SCHMIDT MICHAEL AFTON??? everyone says he is but if this movie is based in 90s then in the timeline, mike should have been scooped already and be undead. IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE. Please explain
Prove it
REMNANT!?
No because it kinda makes sence that it would be the cupcake… but please for the love of all that’s holy… NOT THE BLOODY CUPCAKE XD
I think MatPat will forever have nightmares of FNAF now.
the 5th kid in the dream with the striped shirt sets the kid up as the puppet
Fnaf has been solved... i think?
1:42
Mary Stuart masterson has been confirmed as the main villain of the movie not Matthew lillard
never cared for the games, never cared for the characters, but I'm all for the Lore and I love Blumhouse movies...so yeah, I'm ready for the movie.
BRO SLOW DOWN THE MOVIE IS NOT EVEN OUT YET
Google meat 😊
I told my friends that mr cup cake was the fish child and I was rite
Finally fnaf has taken over all the theorists channels, back in 2014 I would’ve never thought I would we a FILM THEORY on five nights at Freddy’s it’s actually insane
Chill matpat it hasn’t even been released yet 😭
I wonder what the end credit scenes
Can't wait for the movie to come out and for mat to have to redo his whole theory. Here's to reaching 60 episodes on film theory too!
The only thing I saw on the wall that was funny was the Freddy in space drawing
Maybe the "Remnant Extractor" is a prototype for a Sister Location animatronic made by William as a form of killing quick and easy.
Honestly can't wait for team theorist to be forced to make an actual fnaf pizza. This franchise just keeps giving, even when you don't ask it to lol
or his brother isn't real and Micheal was the one kidnapped. Then rebuilt as a robot child
My theory:the reason why golden Freddy's eyes are blue is because that's not golden freddy it's golden Freddy's and sans son
movie has a month before release but hes already solved the whole movie and a bit of the next movie
I have been waiting for this for sooo long.
Same brainwave, cupcake is possessed
Blud solved the lore of something that didn't release 💀
woohoo watch this be correct like it has been for other fnaf theories hes made. Getting spoiled the movie before it even comes out. edit: crazy how much he got right after watching the movie. Actually insane.
It’s funny how I somehow predict Golden Freddy’s left blue eye in my Fnaf 1 anniversary drawing
Another video, another dislike. All this talent wasted on a dead franchise.
It should have been ohio
The movies not even out yet 💀🤣
I like but also kinda dislike that everyone will most likely be right about this. It does kind of get rid of all questions if everyone already knows the twist because of these amazing theories
The movie isn't even out yet and he still finds a way to cover the topic, classic MatPat
YES IVE BEEN SAYING THAT WILLIAM WILL GET SPRINGLOCKED  also I think just like charlotte Abby is a robot of mikes little sister
I think the 5th kid is Michael from the comics the one that Carlton think's is Golden Freddy
the movie aint even out yet and blud already solved it bruh
Now mats gonna go double insane since fnaf is going into movies
It was… inevitable
Mat pat PLEASE DO A POWER RANGERS THEORY
Remember folks THIS IS A A THEORY!!!! He's not saying he's right he's just saying what he thinks!!!!
IT DIDNT EVEN COME OUT
i really hope there will be a spring lock failure part in this movie. Ik ik it is pg 13, but cmon, i waited so long for this!!
3 picture contracts are normal in case they make more they can keep the same cast.
A few months ago I met Matthew Lillard At a convention in ohio and he told me he was going to play purple guy but don't tell anyone 🤫
But, I already have the cookbook, it's pretty basic.
kid with the striped shirt is probs crying child
You and your team are amazing Matt never change you guys are the best💚🖤💚🖤💚
Was surprised that you didn't mention the withered foxy head where freddy was in a place that looked like parts and service! :0
I dont keep track of FNAF lore but the last child has a stripped dirt could they be the puppet? Or is thr puppet not in the film?
Hur hur hur hur hur hur hur hur hur hur, hur hur hur hur hur hur hur hur,
I never imagined there would be a fnaf video, in film theory
Wait da movie is out?
So it's finally happened fnaf has an official video on film theory
Good stuff Matt
Come on man at least let it come out first
For style theory maybe will be about the realistic or possibility of springlock suits (not the deadly part, that already was seen in the bite)
but the striped shirt is the crying child which is golden freddy
@Matpat not a bad thought about the kid with no discernible connection to animatronics, however if I may proffer an alternative:  The kid with no connection to animatronics has a striped shirt, similar to Afton's son who gets bitten by Golden Freddy at the birthday party.
Scott releases the movie an hour ago and this is completely wrong
Actually Scott said he wanted to focus mainly on the first 3 games I doubt baby would be apart of the movie universe sadly
It actually makes sense for the fifth kid to be the cupcake. I mean, his striped shirt says it all, tbh-
Imagine being Mike, and not having Google meet. What a clown.
10:22 “we rangle up Ollie” 😂
This guy will be in a insane aylsum by the time the whole canon lore of fnaf is solved and appvored by scott
the kid had a striped shirt?
I think he just needs a new channel called fnaf theory 😂
I can’t believe there’s finally going to be a third timeline
I actually think that Abby is going to be golden. I think everyone else but Vanessa will die.
it ain’t even out gng 💀
I think film theory has propelled fnaf WAY Farrer than Scott predicted!
Surely, striped shirt is more likely the Puppet.
mapat the cupcake kid looks like the crying child
Fack
Something my friend and I have come up with, we thought that the faces were odd because why with the faces, 3 things happened with faces in these movie trailers, A guy gets his face eaten by a cupcake, a girls face is attacked by a hand which looks like a new bite of 87, and Mike’s face almost being sawed off by that robot thing…but we thought this is odd right, it isn’t, they’re have been cases of adults being stuffed into suits also, but…how it would be cramped and hard to stuff them in, with faces yes without them…no you could shove a adult’s head in a suit no issue if they had no face, so the faces being cut/eaten/graves by a child’s hand doesn’t sound out of place because the adults are being stuffed without faces
Did you solve it though?
I think at the end of the film just when the heroes think they’ve won, the animatronics, (who just made the suspiciously out of character move of doing something noble instead of murdering in agony fueled rage) immediately backstab Mike and Vanessa by kidnapping Abby to eventually turn her into Baby, before anyone can react all of the robots disappear into the shadows and somehow disappearing from the pizzeria, all except Golden Freddy whose different from the others and formed an actual emotional bond with his sister, so much so that he no longer wanted to see her suffer the same way as him, and in this final scene Golden Freddy reveals he has learned how to talk from Abby, and he agrees to tag along with Mike and Vanessa to find his sister, setting up the sequel as our main trio is established, Mike, The Crying Child inside Golden Freddy and Vanessa, ready for the sequel where they start to investigate the disappearance of Abby.
ONE HOUR GANG!!!!
Tell us how the cupcake is a live.
Oh no... it's spreading
I think the 5th kid is the crying child because of his shirt
i understand where youre coming from, but in the silver eyes the animatronics were trying to defend children instead of attack and victimize them. if you were stuffed in an animal, youd wanna make sure no one else has to go through the same pain. this is probably the first fnaf theory i actually dislike. it also wouldnt really be satisfactory if abby just became baby, even if they share a name
PLOT TWIST mikes dad died but fake his death and is now wearing the spring lock suit aka spring bonnie to do... Some kind of goal?
The fifth child is the pupet look at the shirt mat !!
The movie then gets delayed due to MatPat figuring the movie out.
There’s a new article that came out about the movie, and it says that William Afton is now Steve Raglan  So he changed his identity like he did in silver eyes
man, i love stuffing an entire body into a 15cm by 15cm not hollow plastic cupcake
Under an hour gang 👇
That video reminds me about old game theory episode about Sister Location Trailer.🤓
Matpat must be the best theorist because he made a theory on something just based off the trailer
The fifth kids striped shirt reminds me of the puppet. I know it doesn't make sense as that's supposed to be Henry's daughter but still.   "Don't know your fredbears from your nedbears. Much less your glamrocks from your rockstars" got me good lol
to me, from the first time i watched the trailer, Mike becomes Golden Freddy, not Garrett. i mean Abby doesn't even know Garrett. why would she feel anything towards a stranger? she would feel attached towards the older brother that she does know. we'll just have to wait and see when the movie comes out.
The Fnaf movie has invaded film theory
This is what we call a Gilm Theory
Why did that intro actually scare me
Each channel has it's own MatPat and they're all becoming self aware. They each believe themselves to be MatPat: Prime, and an internal war has ensued. Rise up theorists. Defend your MatPat!
People are like bananas, the brown ones are bad🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🔥🔥
watch blumhouse move the release date to next year so they can change the script to match everything matpat said
JESUS THE LORE FROM THE INSTAGRAM POST
Bro solved the lore for a movie that hasn't even been released yet. Love your vids matpat
matpat is genuinely insane
I saw the notification, and immediately went "of course you did..." gg MatPat
hey matthew patrick
Me when the fnaf movie comes out two days before my birthday: :)
Not even out and he solved it. This man is truly incredible.
Bro this is like 28 minutes old you posted this when I was still at school
The kid who becomes Chica (Susie I think, don't remember 100%) she was looking for her dog right ? I mean, maybe they just decide to go on the route of the animal spirit and made the cupcake be a dog. But hey that is just a Theory, A Comment Theory.
nice
I can’t wait to hear Matthew Lillard say “I always come back.” In the Shaggy voice 😂
Matpat solved the FNAF movie before it came out. This man is too talented
depression gone-
Awesome this sounds so real you should probably make a movie 😮😮
What a bold theory Mat, but I still think there’s a chance you’re right👍
come on man more fanf I thought he would do a theory on urbanspook
~casually getting sponsored by f-ing google~
i really needed this today 🥲💞
This movie needs more Nicholas Cage
How you get sponsored be google meet 🤔
14:10 nahh I predict at the end of the movie aby might need to sacrifice her self to save her brother and Vanessa
i live in utah hahaha
It was not a matter of 'If' now, it was a matter of 'when'.
Oh no five nights at Freddy’s it’s spreading it’s on film theory now
I just thought the "torture device" was just the inside of one of the animatronic heads, tbh. Feels like the most likely option to me
11:11 end of sponsor segment
No the reason you shouldn’t expect a happy ending is that this is FNAF it ends most of the time with someone being fired or arson
Because he has brown 🟤 clothing
The amount of comments that can happen in 6 minutes
Bros solving movies before theu even come out
Personally I’d move to Iowa. It was great during the late 90s early 2000s
FnafPat strikes again.
Seen this ad 30 minutes ago for the first time ever, nice timing
The 30 minute club
I would watch this, but I dont want the whole movie being spoiled for me (yes I know it's just a theory, A GAME THEORY)
Abby ( Anagram for BABY )    BABY ( THE MIMIC !!! )
And so it begins.....
I definitely believe at least Vanessa and Mike are going to die. Maybe Abby too, but Mike might sacrifice himself so she can get away.
Five nigh at feddys
Ah yes, the first instalment of another 50 episode series…
It was only a matter of time… 😂😂
Hi Matt! Hope you see this, wanted to say hi, and thank you for staying true with your amazing content over the years! Hope youre doing well!
Scott: Alright guys the movie has been delayed to october 31st 2025
15:49 Its just like how Killer Queen has Sheer Heart Attack!
I think the cupcake is the dog of chica, the cupcake jump and bite the face of that dude like a guard dog, is something i think recenlty
Early, 30 min gang
Here before it blows up
Mat has underestimated Fnaf lore! This is only the beginning Mat Pat! HAHAAAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
The one time matpat doesn’t match cloths to charecter, 15:35. Lol
No it's not cupcake it's freddy
1 hour gang  👇
I have been waiting sooooo long for this!
im really questioning matpats sanity now
google meet ..... soon to be in the google graveyard
according to Matpat, the FNAF Movie is based in real life events
Something noteworthy is that the cast that was released earlier in the year on IMDb said Mathew Lillard played William Afton, along with Mary Stuart Masterson not having the title of “Mike’s aunt” but instead “unnamed female villain”
I was always curios if the Fnaf movie would be a Film theory or a Game Theory looks like i finally got my answer.
30 min!!
I mean. You’d want to move to Nebraska if you lived in the Mormon cesspit that is Utah
The cupcake is Susie’s dog.
Oh… does this mean u won’t be in the movie…?
matpat is the only youtuber to sponser google meets of all things in a fnaf theory video
Didnt expect this
Nice
I knew this would come out before the movie
when the fnaf movie comes out mat pat is going to teleport to the cinema
I still think that the weird Freddy head is going to be from a dream sequence, with Mike having a nightmare about being shoved into a suit.
Hey Mat. Scott confirmed in a Dawko charity livestream he was playing William Afton.
Fnaf is slowly, but surely terrorizing all of Matpats channels
I think the 5th kid is the golden freddy. Look at him. He has the crying childs clothes and his head looks like Cassidy
We’ve been waiting for this video since 2015.
I think the film we be kind of like a silver eyes adaptation because the film and the book share a bit of things
Frickin Google MEET dawg?
Cheeseburger
Something I disagree with is the kid MatPat claims is "Freddy" in the MCI scene is wearing yellow and a top hat and the kid who doesn't have anything is wearing brown. I think the kid he thinks is some special cupcake soul kid is Freddy and Golden Freddy is the kid with the hat
Bro figured out the lore before it came out 💀
cupcake theory on food theory.
I love how the fnaf franchise seems to slowly be driving Matpat insane
Maybe they make abby into baby at the end...?
... has better help ever sponsored a theorist video? /j
bro let it come out first
fnaf at freddy: movie is the move ever
Matpat do a video on bee and puppycat 🐝
It ain't even out yet, and Mat's already on it.
Amazing! ! ! 👏👏👏
Matt Pat what you could do is you could you make a style theory episode about how the springboks could actually work in real life without you dying obviously
Matpat finally having a movie for fnaf to review
Doesn't the kid without characteristics look like the crying child?
I stg if you aren't a cameo in the movie I will freak!
Great video I cannot wait for the movie to come out
LETS GOO
I am the only one who thought this was Game Theory up until he said it was Film Theory?
The movie's not out yet 😫 hold your theories for when its outttttt
I feel like knowing the "rivalry" that Scott and Theorist have developed through years. Scott intentionally put misleading stuff in the trailers so that almost none of the Theorists' predictions will be right
it was only a matter of time after seeing the movie i have to say MAT YOU NEW ALL ALONGE
Ima save this after the movie is out and available. Sorry Mat even if there are no spoilers. 🫡
i think if theres a post credit scene its about 90% springbonnie in a more rotten outfit, also i think they midght save Baby for the 2nd or maybe even the 3rd movie because theres of course still the theories about Baby in the games playing  a bigger role then it seems
13:40 nahh I predict she's gonna time travel to the past seeing William afton luring the children then she'll be back panicking to what she has witnessed
My high school marching band got free tickets to any movie we want but it expires the day before the fnaf movie releases 😭
Mat will be so right that the movie will change their entire plot
HOW DID YOU GET GOOGLE MEET TO SPONSOR YOU?!?!?!
ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET- HOW.
I mean, there WAS a cupcake jumpscare in FNAF 4 that I remember seeing through Markiplier
matpat i will subcirbs if yiou heart my coment 1!!11!!!!!!!
Finally , a film theory FNAF video
He wasn't satified with the games so he went to movies now
Plot twist the cop is Elizabeth
2:47 i think thats just an animatronic suit. You know in fnaf 1 if they see you they think your an endo without a suit on so they shove you in one that looks like a mask and the insude spunny things are just the gears to move the face.
IT! HASN’T! EVEN! COME! OUT!
I bet he got this right and now they are ganna delay the movie because he knows to much
Man it’s sad that after the movie Scott’s leaving!…I mean he’s going to go spend time with his family so we can’t blame him but still! I’m kinda sad
bro solved the movie before its out😂
Matpat is my favorite nerd on the internet
Hor hor hor
I'm nit gunna woch this video until after I see the fnaf movie I'm sure you understand lol
guys matpat he broke whit his wife?
That kid could be puppet because of his shirt
What if the unknown kid in the striped short is the puppet?
🧹
My film theory is that matpat is actually in the movie but has a main character so they won't spoil
That’s insane for the movie not to come out he still makes the best theories ever!
May pat please read this Steve raglan is an anagram for everlasting so that means Steve raglan is william afton
Would be cool if they „beat“ Afton due to the springlock failure and we get a very horrifying scene
1.5kendthemdrhrhtthndth
I have a theory idea for  Despicable Me:  What if Gru and Dru switched parents? Like what if Gru went with the dad and Dru went with the Mom?
And finally, film theory has a fnaf  episode
you've got 3 crews of people going to see this movie, fnaf fans, normal people and matpat cultists-err fans. so him potentially spoiling the movie might look bad to a movie studio is actually good since he is sic'ing his fanbase on it.
Just saying vanessa when taking about the search she referred to the Police police as they and by using that word I say that as a police officer she would refer to them with we instead of they  , could this mean she’s kinda like a observer looking in from the outside (sry for grammar errors I’m quite bad)
Mad pat the movie isn’t even out yet and  your doing it
I figured the weapon was the scooper??? Ya know, from sister location
THERE IS NO CIRCUS BABY IN THE MOVIE!!!
No you didn’t.
Does anyone think it would be funny if the fnaf movie is just Scott Cawthon playing FNAF world on a big theater screen. It would be a perfect troll!!!
AM i the only one that thinks its weird that Horror and Creepy games are the famous ones. Its starting to scare me that these are meant for kids. Poppy playtime, fnaf, Garten of banban and Rainbow friends. etc. What have we come too....
2:43 it could being stuffed into one of the Freddy Suit but it could be that
I feel like MatPat would be the most viable option if YouTube needed a new CEO.
I hate the fact that nobody mentions Mike’s Aunt anymore
I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  The Soul in the Cupcake is Susie's dog.
Blud really figured it out before it was completed ☠
Scott watching this right now : Goddamit mat GODDAMIT
Here we go again, down this rabbit hole.
I have a theory the 5th kid is garret and he is trying to protect his sister and I would assume we are gonna get an ITS ME part
Some guy: If only matpat actually made a fnaf movie himself  Me: IT EXISTS
It didn’t even come out relax Mattpatt 😂
0:50 I want one! 😮
that jumpscare *chef's kiss
Five night Freddy
MatPat got sponsored by flipping google meet...
I’m honestly surprised how MatPat is not gonna be in the fnaf movie.
If you don't care for sponserships, skip to 11:12
Hi!  I have a theory myself. I agree with the fact that mike s little brother is golden Freddy and Abby is baby but that actually  makes the afton family. I think that  mike is mike afton but there will be a big twist like matpat is saying and that will be Abby becoming baby and mike finding out who his father actually is ( William afton). Agin this is more of a speculation but it makes sense IF matpat s theory is true ))
Har har harhar har 🐻
When I think escape and freedom, I think Nebraska
I'm calling it: the cupcake is Susie's dog
Finally, a film theory on fnaf
On so we gonna get a food theory from what the pizzas are made and about how fashionable the springlock suits are
Bro Mat you need a Podcast version of your videos I would listen a 100 hours a day! 😂
Here we go again Mattpad is like an excited child 👯‍♀️
I think it very obvious that Vanessa is wrong about what the animatronics want.
Hi matpat   Edit: I don’t think they’re gonna go by the games with this judging by the fact that you made waaaay more Book references than the games
15:12 WAAAAAIT HE HAS STRIPES THO ON HIS SHIRT. The marionette?
I'm thinking the kid in the striped shirt is the security puppet.
FNAF ON FILM THEORY?!?!!?!?!?!
What are they cooking children 🤨
Hi
You say this every time
MatPat realizing FNAF will be spreading around his channels: Hehe, I’m in danger.
still dont understand why matpat isnt in the movie
Mat really can’t catch a break can he 😂😂
15:50: It's prolly Susie's dead dog
It's appleten
Yesssss
But that would mean know bite of 83
That last kid is freddy cause we see him run towards freddy and his hand comes out
Do a theory on coralline
Fnaf is now on FILM theory also I feel like you got the movie wrong even though you “solved” the timeline wait are you just misleading us with this video
Abby(baby), they want to make her a part of her. Weeeeeeeell it seems easy to see what is going to happen.
Please no more remnant. PLEASE SCOTT, PLEASE, I HAVE A FAMILY, PLEASE NO, NO MORE, LEAVE ME ALONE, PLEASE, GOD HELP, PLEASE OH GOD.
Damm spoiler alert
They also took over the Food Theory channel, don't forget the cookbook. 😉
Looked like the last one had stripes on their shirt. (Or it could just be my eyesight) could become the puppet instead of the cupcake.
Can you make a Playlist of the theories that turned out to actually be spot on? It'd be fun to watch a marathon of them
You know it’s time when FILM theory uploads a fnaf theory
One thing I can say is this franchise likes capturing it's victims. And making sure it's diverse.
Im excited for the move and I was extremely suprised and exicted because it happens to release on my birthday october 27th
my theory? there will be three alternate endings with different lore hidden in each one so you have to see the movie three times on different days to see all the hidden lore XD
“This series exploded about a decade ago” Thank you for triggering a quarter life crisis for me Mat. Twenty has never felt like such a big number 🙃.
I'm so excited for the fnaf movie 🎥
That mystery machine definitely looked like the scraper that takes remnant
7:25 Matthew Lilard literally said he was gonna be Purple Guy multiple times, nothing much to solve there
saw this 25 min ago
Seeing a fnaf theory on film theory feels weird
The torcher device is the mask for the animatronics. As said by Phone Guy in FNAF 1, all the gears, wires and other devices would tear the human body to bits.
But the question that remains would be : How do you put a child into a cupcake for him to be possessed?
Funny thing, I just had a google meet with my therapist before watching this video, no joke I got off and logged onto YouTube and immediately clicked on this video to watch it
Great video!
Now they'll change the movie.
Twitter: so you have chosen death.  Not me. You’re cool
matpat jumpscare
YAY😄
The boy does look like crying child and Gregory
Bro couldnt wait for the lore😭😭
Loved the video anyone been waiting for this video?
You did whaaat?
So no bite of 83?
Whoever got here before an hour like this😊
love the vid keep it up good work❤👍
Can someone play the prowler music when the video is about cut so that the cupcake has a them
I'm kinda upset about all the changes, I know it's just Matt's lore tho lol
That Cupcake was always sus.
this isnt game theory
Lowkey woulda been funny if he had done the Game Theory intro for this one, considering how long FNAF has taken its toll on this channel
Oh god it's spreading.....
Nah man everything good but REMNANT?!?!?
With the striped shirt on the kid I thought for sure we were going to say that kid was going to be the Puppet, but I guess him being a cupcake isn't that crazy for this francise but striped shirt always screams Puppet to me.
I've been waiting for this movie for 8 years... I'm only 15...
i think this is a really good theory and think this might be plot for the movie but i think the last part about Abby getting stuff in baby is a strecth to be frank still a really good theory.
Yes more matpat
that kid i tyhink could maybe be the pupet because of their striped shirt. idk tho
Cant wait for the fnaf fashion line😂❤️
Wait till MatPat Is wrong
I’m on iPad how do I keep my eyes on my monitor
bro it didnt even come out yet 😭😭😭
11:12 To Skip Sponsor
I think that Steve Raglin is a pseudonym that good ‘ol Billy Afton changed his name to Steve Raglin
Everyone keeps making the boy in the brown shirt some outcast while making the kid in the gold shirt and top hat Freddy. Im going with Bonnie, Freddy, Foxy, Golden, Chica.
Clicked on this faster than Afton's killing sprees
I swear Matpat probably went and actually stole a pizza oven from the movie's set
Man, I’m just starting this video and I just feel like everyone to subscribe and like in put on notifications and always check out the new videos and claim your ticket within an hour
same with the cupcake what if candy cadets 5 into 1 stores are for the circus animatronics but bon-bon is the 5th one for the 5 into 1. circus baby, Funtime foxy, ballora, Funtime Freddy, and bon-bon?
I definitely feel like William Afton will be a twist reveal for the movie, general Audiences aren't going to know about Springtrap or how Afton killed the Children in the past.
I love the kid being the cupcake, but how did he fit the body in the tiny little cupcake? I would think it's hilarious if you could figure out how
Seeing a FNAF video on Film Theory gave me an out of body experience
Finally ❤
2:05  FNAF never usually has a happy ending though cause we're all traumatized by how complicated this lore is
15:22 To me it looks like that 5th kid has a brown shirt on. He’s probably Freddy and the kid with the top hat and the yellow shirt is golden Freddy
Ever since the announcement I’ve been waiting for a film theory on this franchise and even if he’s wrong on this theory you can’t deny he’s accurate in what we got from these trailers so far and I’m impressed every time. Can’t wait to see what people are thinking to casual audiences when they don’t know the franchise. Can’t wait for the movie regardless if this is the story or something else.
i like how kids irl are a source of a lot of information nowadays; they rly just let anything slip and that's also kinda similar to how ppl use to fish info out of tom holland for any marvel related stuff. truthfully, matpat didnt need these kids for any NEW information but it did reaffirm a lot of his thoughts.
Having fnaf on film theory is amazing  Wonder if any theories could be made on food/style theory
OMG, there actually might be spring lock failure scene!!!
Can you do not your normal kid show
I legitimately didn't know that any of the five nights at Freddy's games were on Nintendo switch so the fact that you're showing those covers like if those are unofficial that's very well designed and if those are official I am scared for how badly five nights at Freddy's security breach will run on the switch I'm sure there's got to be like loading zones every 10 ft
I feel like you are one of the best YouTubers next to Laurenzside.
I dont know but the 5th kid screams Pupet for me with that striped shirt
The “Unknown child” in the 5 children's scene is wearing a Striped shirt like Even (The Crying Child)
bruh Fnaf jumped to film theory now  im concerned for matpat's health
The first 3 minutes already reminds me about Marvel what if.
17:27 what if....now hear me out they pull another twist. Who else had red or blue eyes the zombies being controlled by Richthofen or Samantha Maxis. FNAF/CoD Zombies dark ether shared universe lol 🤯😆
Not as cool as Food Battle coming back
One thing... to point out ... 5 kids +1 kidnap "garrett" and G freddy only with 1 blue eye , kinda remmebers me the fact that G freddy has 2 inside ... your know ... kinda something inpoetant to call out
I knew I should've waited to watch this till after the movie. Basically spoiled the entire thing. But hey, its just a theory... A FILM THEORY!!! Thanks for posting this mat
Just stop
Still never found out if you got to be  part of the movie, matt! Dont make me wait till it comes out to find out 😭
how did bro get sponsered by google
So it’s in realty that the movie is more based on The Silver Eyes where the very end of the book is where the Animatorncis drag and hide William when he gets Sprung. Sure some elements of games and books and theory’s, but yeah, that’s what I’m understanding from what your telling me
Well that was fast. I'm almost surprised Scott didn't straight up ask him not to theorize on this movie.
Even Google Meet getting hyped for the juicy LOOOOOOOOOOORE
(before you read this, be aware that this is my first theory ever, so don't be mean if i'm wrong, thank you!) Okay, I have a theory! I know someone else is gonna make a video about this so I wanna call it before anyone else does: Cassie is Charlie! Okay listen I have a reason that I think is good (and it aligns with matpat's theory!), okay so according to Matpat's theory Henry is the creator of the circus baby animatronic, so you think that if henry made circus baby, he would also at least see the circus baby restaurant, and here’s where the theory comes in! So in the the help wanted 2 trailer we can see those circuit board things from RUIN, i propose that Henry was the one that put those there because of that fact you need a FAZ-wrench to activate them, and Henry would be the only person who could use a faz-wrench because of the name, think about William at this point is no longer working for Fredbear, he’s now working for circus baby’s, it’s not called a Circus baby-wrench, no it's called a FAZ-wrench, implying that someone from fazbear entertainment is the one who placed it there. And I don’t think they would just give out faz-wrenches to random employees, implying that Henry is the one with the faz-wrench, and what does Cassie say at the beginning of RUIN “a faz-wrench it's just like my dad’s”. I don’t think that steel wool would mention her dad if he’s not an important character, I think that there trying to tell us something, they are just screaming “THE DAD IS IMPORTANT TO THE STORY!!!!”, and with all this in mind, it’s clear that when they say dad, there talking about Henry, and Henry only has one daughter, Charlie, which means that Cassie has to be Charlie. Now there’s a hole in this theory, and that is that there is nobody who would rebuild Charlie. Charlie is well-known to be dead, so who would rebuild her? We know its not Henry because he killed himself at the end of fnaf world (P.S I don’t know if that’s the right game, I don’t know which game he dies in, I just know he’s dead) and the wife’s not doing it, her goal is to bring back her family, why would she want to rebuild that family that killed it? so who would it be, well hear me out and keep an open mind on this, one of the main things you do in FNaF SB is upgrade freddy with other animatronic part, which shows that to some extent Gregory knows how to build an animatronic, and we both know where this is going, I think Gregory made Cassie, hear me out Gregory is no longer on aftons side because (this is where Matpat's ultimate timeline comes in) Charlie is the one who made gregory go rogue, John from FuNaff made a theory stating that gregory was not alone in the sticky note room but was communicating with Charlie a spirit and that she is the one who made him turn on the aftons, and the events of security breach are influenced by Charlie, but what if charlie took it a step further, what if Charlie influenced Gregory to literally rebuild her!? Now there another hole in this theory, now steel wool doesn’t just put things in there games to prove theories’, they also put things in there games to DISprove theories’ and here’s where things get confusing, according to the cardboard cutouts in security breach on Cassie’s 11th birthday she hung out with Roxy, but Gregory only learns how to build a robot after the events of security breach but that then presents us with a few problems and that is that roxy is a mandatory bossfight, it was always weird to me that roxy was the one that we forced to destroy, like i thought it would be monty, but no it was roxy and i pushed this off as a minor detail, but they did this for a reason, to disprove this theory. If Cassie is built after the events of the princess quest ending that means roxy has to be destroyed, it is impossible to get the ending if roxy is not dismantled, so how would Cassie be able to hang out with roxy if she was already destroyed, I don’t really have an answer for it, but that’s all for my theory. I really just wanted to make this before game theory or FuhNaff make this theory (which trust, me they will), so yeah have great day!
Tap/Click here if you want to see MatPat in FNAF Movie? 👇
:0
I can't wait for Scott to change the entirety of his plot just to prove Mat wrong when the movie comes out Edit: I'm pretty sure that the blade-maskey-thingy is a reskinned scoop, because just a claw would be too boring in a movie. We might actually be able to see michael getting scooped!
Hold up am I on the right channel😨😨😨
And also I thought it was obvious that Mike died and turned into golden freddy in the trailer
18:24 I don't like this idea here I hope it's not the case. I remember Scott said he wanted the movie's be based of the first 3 games. Fnaf 1, 2, and 3 I might be wrong just something I heard.
So,does that mean we're gonna get a three channel fnaf theories?
I bet that when matpat finally retires hes going to pass the mantle to his child and the theorist legacy will just pass on from child to child to child
the movie aint even out and bro already knows what's in it 💀
Garrets is the crying child
hello film theory, this is internet.
alright, cupcake arg time
I loved this theory ❤
Matpat is about to make them remake the entire film because he guessed the plot accurately..
ITS NOT EVEN OUT YET HOW-
fnaf is taking over every channel, fashion theory watch out 💔
Plot twist jigsaw was behind all it
Not only does matpat get sponsored by google, but this is the first time fnaf breaks out of game theory, it can now be present on film theory.
They could always do it in a way where abby makes a sacrifice like saving the other two but gets hurt, they somehow find the baby animatronic in the building, they put her dying body inside as a way to save her
Dude the child that you think is the cupcake has the crying child's shirt
ngl google meet sponsor is crazy
Man i need that fnaf cook book
I’m surprised that we haven’t seen any signs of Mat(Pa)t in this movie.
Matpat spoiling the whole movie to himself and the fans just by seeing the trailer alone is incredible
Imagine if if enough movie the second one is based on circus baby in the twenty metronics
This might be a dumb idea but what if the flashback Mike has with the 5 kids running away is a refrence to the happiest day minigame, its him trying to put their spirits to rest.
I like this theory a lot more than some others. Also a lot more jokes landed on this one.  Good theory! Bonnie will block Afton in the safe room! And put a red bow on it, why, idk you put one on the poster.
I MET MATPAT
"[Five Nights at Freddy's] exploded about a decade ago" So it's really been that long, huh?
The 5th kid could be the puppet? He was wearing a shirt, that looks kinda like the arms of the puppet.
If his father is casted for a flashback then they could still be be the same person.
Lets take a moment to thank Jesus Christ for what he did for us on calvarys cross, he suffered and died for our sins so that by putting our faith in him as Lord and saviour we would be saved. But he didn't stay dead, he rose from the dead 3 days later! He defeated satan, sin, and death! Put your faith in him and he will never fall short or forsake you, he will always be there for you. I hope you make the right choice. God bless you and Jesus loves you
It ain't even out. How?!
Who else is waiting for them to release FNAF The Movie The Game?
Wow great theory really hope this actually does happen though it would be so cool!
FNAF will always haunt Matpat
its the marianrte... the final kid has a stripe shirt...wdym its the cupcake ?
I feel old realizing I've been watching fnaf theories for 10+ yrs now
No way.
I hope MatPat gets a cameo in the movie as a crazy detective that tries to solve who the killer is
1:26 scares, in fnaf?
The only thing I want for this film is that William gets springlocked and the fact that we have spring bonnie and not spring trap in the trailers makes me so hopeful that that will happen
Im dissaponted that he didn't call his parents grandpa and grantmat
MatPat: *Solves the entire FNAF movie without it coming out*
I disagree with the animatronics taking a victim. They just want to protect her, like in the silver eyes, from the adults.
Ok, I think you got a solid on most of the stuff Matt but the whole Abby turns into Baby thing is downright bonkers, I mean Scott said that the lord of the movies is going to be based on the first 3 games, why would they introduce baby when she wasn’t a part of the lore yet?
Imagine if matpat after solving the fnaf movie and he finds out that help wanted 2 is coming
Heck no. 0:17
Great, now they won't have to show the Movie in Theaters anymore thanks MatPat.
This is peak cinema
I will say one thing about a line Matpat said that is dead wrong. Part 1 did NOT take place in 1993, that was just the date the check Michael Afton found in the old pizzeria. This is further supported by the fact that phone guy can't be dead in '93 because 2 reasons:  1: Purple guy isn't dead until around '95 as evident by the books. 2: Part 1 states that the characters haven't been cleaned in 20 years. That dates phone guy's death to about 2013.  Michael would be visiting these pizzerias after they had been shut down where he might find old newspaper clippings and checks.
Okay mat💀💀💀
Maybe do a style theory on springlock suits? A science focused episode!
They said it will never come true
Dawg GOOGLE MEETS??? HOW DO YOU EVEN GET A SPONSORSHIP FROM THEM WHAT
WHAT?!?!?! ALREADY?!?!?!?!?!?
Do you think Mike’s lil brother is Golden Fredbear?  Especially since they befriend Abby, that could be some kind of connection
But if Abby is supposed to be baby then what about Williams daughter?
7.4k like.
Isn't the yellow bunny the character you played in the random encounters fnaf music vid?
I love how team theorists can put together an entire movie plot by just the trailers. Seriously impressive
Isnt the puppet gonna be in the movie?
Ever since the announcement I’ve been waiting for a film theory on this franchise and even if he’s wrong on this theory you can’t deny he’s accurate in what we got from these trailers so far and I’m impressed every time. Can’t wait to see what people are thinking to casual audiences when they don’t know the franchise. Can’t wait for the movie regardless if this is the story or something else.
I'm pretty sure fnaf 4 is just matpats nightmares of the lore
I think Abby would only befriend Freddy from a malfunction like in sb
Aww what a cute little bunnyOHMYGODITSTAKINGITSFACEOFF
Last time google sponsered mat was the Walter files and that still gives me nightmares so I scared to watch this
MAT THE MOVIE IS BARLY OUT MAN LET US WATCH BEFORE YOU SOLVE THE INTRE THING ;-;
Thank you very much
5:52 So "NEBRASKA" is Mike's "Do it for HER"...? Or his ALASKAN ESCAPE PLAN?
Honestly surprised it took this long to get a fnaf film theory
GOOGLE MEET?!?!?!? 🤣🤣🤣
I've been WAITING for a fnaf movie theory from the main theory man
Matpat going on this whole thing about how Mathew is definitely afton even though it was the first casting confirmed
matpat you gotta be some kind of detective trying to figure out freddys in the movie and markiplier should be a more expirienced nightquard or the phone guy . AND I HOPE THERE IS A SPRINGLOCK SCENE i want to give my parents trauma :)
18:43 oh you. you dont even know how close you are xDD
WOAH!!!! WOAH WOAH WOAH THERE! GARRETT?! NEBRASKA?! I'm in the FNAF movie!!! Granted, it's Garrett and not my name Garett, but I think it still counts!!!
😮
My birthday on the 20th and bet your Fazasses! I'm HOLDING THAT MONEY TILL THE 27TH
I like this theory a lot more than some others. Also a lot more jokes landed on this one.  Good theory! Bonnie will block Afton in the safe room! And put a red bow on it, why, idk you put one on the poster.
Feels cursed to see fnaf stuff on film theory
we can never escape
Matpat please! The movie hasn’t even come out yet.
LEZGO
Matpat spoiled a movie a month before it released 😂😂😂
Hello, did I make it 🎉🥚
I lover your vids
Ok but why did you do that though
If Matpat doesnt have a cameo in this movie we riot
How about that the little girl is not Abby but Emily
A new upload from Daddy Matty makes me Gladdy
What is this, a crossover episode
ARE THEY NOT DOING THE BIT OF 83
Finally talking about FNAF on The Film Theorists channel. Also, you should have said “It’s been so long”  at the beginning instead of “It’s been so many years.”
I feel like some people just feel bad for Matt at this point
Freddy
I'm seeing Matt's got a New FNAF video, and just thinking:"Oh realy?" and clicking on it
Mat this is an intervention. Please stop. You're scaring us all
I was kind of wondering when you'd get to this
I feel like mikes dad is just William Afton but younger
No it's the puppet look at the strike
Last child that they think it's the cupcake I have a theory.... Kid wearing a striped shirt right... that kid  could be either the movie stand in for the puppet with it's stripped design or Evan as Golden Freddy because of the stripped shirt
oh frick my birthday is near the release of the fnaf movie... huh.... neat
!!!! FILM THEORY FINALLY GETS TO TALK ABOUT FNAF!!!! Like, TALK talk about it! A momentous occasion!
what if the reason sister location is hard to place is because elizabeth didn’t die during the grand opening with william but died when micheal went down there in search of william. that’s why abby is with micheal in the movie
Im so excited for the movie, cant wait to see it!
for a sec i thought this was game theory
matpat, your the only person i know, who could make full theroy vid from some trailers.
har har har har har har har har har har
When i hit the like button it changed from 6.2k never done that before
Mike better be an afton
I swear if there’s a random vanilla icecream sitting on the ground, with a pair of green eyes peeking out of the shadows…..
Hey Matpat what do you think might happen with the mysterious character Home Sammon (played by Zackary Arthur)?? They're trying to hide something. Could he be some variation of the crying child (because of the "home" and him being WIlliam's son)
😮😮
never expected to be reminded of the existence  annoying orange by matpat
And here I was, thinking it was gonna be Mike in Golden Freddy with Abby. It would be a fun twist. I am interested in how they'll do the Springlock, after all SpringBonnie was first, then Springtrap.
Not even out and there's 4
how are people saying stuff before they even watch the video its 19 mins long and there its only been 15 mins since releasea nd people are typing about how they like the video etc like no offense i definetly love this youtuber im tuning in every time he makes a video on all four of the channels but i just dont understand why people want to comment so early its not someting special there is no goal accomplished wether you are the first to comment or not yall should calm down (also yes im to lazy to use punctuation)
BBBBBBBBAAAAAA A A A A A A  A A A A A A A
First film theory Fnaf theory letss go!!!
"Oh my sweet stars what have I done" 😂😂😂
YESSSSSSS FNAF ON FILM THEORY!!!! YESS YES YES YES YES
And theory what is going to happen before it happens
Man, I really hope they scrap the remnant and sci-fi stuff and William is just murdering for the sake of it.
how are you guys sayin love the videos when it hasn’t even been out for 19 mins
I like fnaf
17 minutes!!!!
The unknown child might be the crying child
i assumed the stripey shirt kid was gonna be the puppet lol
(13:57)  About the “They want to make her like them” line, I think it might be a bit of a misdirect. I think they’ll later reveal that Vanessa was wrong, since there’s been various instances stating the animatronics are only aggressive to adults and teenagers.   *BUT HEY! THAT’S JUST A THEORY! A FILM THEORY!*
No way. NO WAY. NO F**KING WAY MATHEW PATRICK GOT SPONSORED BY *GOOGLE*.
i thought when you said its code for he killed those kids and stuffed them in suits and turned them into haunted robots i thought you were also gonna say and make my life a living nightmare of fnaf books
Make a theory on x files, it ended a few years ago and is literally a show just about theories, its made for this channel.
WHY IS IT NOT EVAN AFTON
I was wondering what channel the FNaF movie would be on!
Dont you DARE try this matthew we KNOW youre in this movie
2:52 You might want to check out this one at the end of the trailer the night guard was in golden Freddy, which means that is the spring lock animatronic Fred bear a.k.a. golden Freddy or I’am but just saying. PS NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN!
Matpat are you going to be in the movie
2:40 thats the scoop from sister location...
is mattpatt gonna be phone guy?? 10:10 it would make sense for him to say that in the ad bc most people would skip the ad but i think that the phone guy is defiantly gonna be a content creator and i think mark or matt would fit him perfectly
Matpat:“We’re gonna solve it before it comes out!” Me:”nuh uh”
Okay, maybe im crazy, but i think the kid in the brown striped shirt is freddy, and the kid in the top hat has to be golden freddy.  Has anyone else made this connection?
Har har har har
Can you talk about the paw patrol movie that is about to come out?
like zoinks matpat i think like i'm the man behind the slaughter dude
uh oh
the kid that you said might be cupcake has a striped shirt might be replicating puppet but im not sure
I can’t believe you made of a theory about the upcoming Fnaf movie now that’s pretty cool
Food and film theory are my favorite but game and style are excellent aswell
The movie MUST have a TLT song
im sick rn and this makes me feel better(mentally) like- i feel like im dying and film theory is making me not
2:04 it's FNaF, it never ends happily
Are you sure about that
FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Chocola babana  Yeah have a nice day everyone
Here within 14 mins
3:10 The twist ending that the star is NOT Mike Schmidt, but rather Von Hayes, but NO, Shyamalan Twist, try to keep up, lotta twists, lotta turns, hes really Steve Bedrosian, yeah? NO... Ol Stevie B removes his trademark beard and DUN DUN DUNNNNNNN: HOFer Steve Carlton, shedding his insanely banal and insomnia curing personality and showing how he releases his rage over the winter when theres no one to throw fastballs to!
10 seconds and 10 comments wowie
The collab between game theory and film theory is gonna be a big one
w im early early this time matpat coming in clutch
I'm gonna be in the retirement home still watching Mat's fnaf theories
Ayyyyy I'm pretty early
No the cupcake is being possessed by a dog
It’s been so long (pun unintended), but FNAF has finally escaped its Game Theorist prison and found its way into Film Theory.
I haven’t seen the video yet but I’m so excited 😆 yay 🎉finally a film theory on the fnaf movie 🎥 yeeesss!!
Hey MatPat, when you say a portion of the episode was sponsored, does that mean the rest wasn't sponsored or is it by someone else who didn't require a mention?
Faa Naa AT FFFRREEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Not gonna lie I never thought they would make a FNAF film but am sorta glad
What about Home Sammon? How does he fit in?
Let’s go!
I will only like this video if his predictions are correct. See me on October 27th
I love fanf
I've been waiting for matpat to make this video ever since the trailer came out
MatPat should make his own lore where all 4 channels (film, style, food and game) interact with each other and have a problem that is kind of like the shorts war or if they go against youtube or something like that and the fans have to try to find evidence, links and unlisted videos to try to solve his lore.
You solved the fnaf movie before IT CAME OUT WHO IS THIS MAN!?
Matpat: Hello internet welcome to game theory    Also Matpat: wait an minute this isn’t game theory it’s filllllm theory
Hey Mat, i love that theory but i think that the kid that you say its the cupcake is the crying Child because of the model on his blouse
Early!!
Imagine the alternate universe where mat pat covered slender instead of fnaf
MATPAT STOP. THE MOVIE HASN'T EVEN COME OUT. CALM DOWN
Isnt mike the movie version of michael and abby the movie version of elizabeth?
WHY WHY IS HE NOT MICHAEL AFTON
YEAAAAAAASSS
It ain't even out yet bruh 😭
MatPat, you’re awesome. Also, the first thing I thought of when I saw Mike in the first trailer was “HOW THE F*** IS HE NOT A PURPLE CORPSE WHAT DID YOU DO”
Great know FNAF is taking over film theory 😂
i love google meat
Finally happened you crazy son of a gun they did it
Yay! More Fnaf content! Gotta love the infection that is William Afton 😅
First 50k
0:08 you could say "IT'S BEEEEEEN SO LOOOONG 🎶🎶...."
Good movies not even out and you’re making a theory about it. Seriously, why not wait until the movies out
I think the kid could be the replacement for Charlie, or CC. Cmon Matpat. Striped Shirt?
15 minutes Club
Bro really tried to sneak Nebraska in there 💀
If he can get 20 minutes out of trailers and posters imagine how much stuff he will analyze in the actual movie
love it man keep it up
FNAF: I always comeback
6:18       The picture of the yellow bunny rabbit aka William also shows 5 kids huh
Google Meet..? again??? martket share?? XDS
👍
4:00 actually thats Springbonnie
If I had a nickel for every time matpat has accepted a sponsorship from google on film theory I’d have 2 nickels. Its not a lot but its weird that it’s happened twice
Sounds like that killer clown 🤡 serial killer
idea: would an animatronic suit fit a child?
Matpats that one guy who makes theories on something that hasn't even shown up in theaters
That's funny that day is my birthday
As someone who lives in Nebraska... I would like for it to take place here! But If it is where Mike wants to go. I get it. Cheep to live here :)
Mat, calm down
Hello internet welcome to film theory!most og line of MatPat
Fnaf has put matpat in a choke hold💀
This is day one of asking for a helluva boss episode 🎉
Dayumn
It has begun fnaf is now on film theory
How many times had mat pat said HD "figured out the lore"
Actually, here is what I think will happen. Help Wanted establishes the first few games are just games but are inspired by real events. Therefore that is why Vanessa fits here with Mike. And what about Abby? Well since SL is also just a game, no one said that she has to die at SL. Also something that bugged me is how Vanessa acts in the game. I believe she is going to be a survivor of WIllaim Afton and her PTSD from that gets her to play Help Wanted where Glitchtrap isn't real but makes her insane, launching the new games
I and my friend use Meet for gamling togheter or write somethings.
Bro it didn’t even COME OUT yet!
Five Nights at Freddy's weekend
1 hour gang 👇
I’m sure this theory is great. IM NOT WATCHING IT UNTIL AFTER THE MOVIE🤣  But I’ll leave a like for the team’s hard work
As someone who lives in nebraska, why would anyone want to live here like its so boring
6:32 or another reason I prefer not to say
I solved the fnaf franchise
Wait, MatPat has a kid?
It only took 4 gtlive trailer  watches🎉🎉
We all knew it was gonna happen
Can't wait for matt and his team to bring out some notebooks at the cinema so they can extract every single piece of lore from the movie!!
Now we only need an official Fnaf restaurant to bring it to both food theory and style theory (the mascots) and all of the theory channels will have at least one fnaf theory.
Matpat always cookin fr
I'm surprised that you made this Film Theory before the Five Nights At Freddys movie released.
If Markiplier doesn't make a cameo in the movie then it's not worth watching it.
Lol this video is so goood
I'm so glad to see that FNAF not only on the game theorist channel but now also on the Film theorist This is a historical moment on YouTube
Re-shoots announced in 3... 2... 1...
Leave it to mat pat to figure out the lore before the movie comes out
i cant wait to see how horrible wrong he is
30 minute gang⬇️
Awesome Video Mate
Why is the cast leaking the plot/throwing us off the plot
The movie comes out on my birthday🎉
FNAF Cook Book you say? I'm ready to see how Willy-A controlled people with food ingredients now. Going back to the old times of Coke Coca-Cola.
Wow he figured it out before the movie did 💀
Finally I get to know whether the fnaf movie would be game theory or film theory
We all really know that Matpat is really a dancing animatronic in real life
That was soon.
bro it aint even out 😭
In school right now
Under 1 hour gang 👇
Oh, god…! The FNaF virus is spreading!! *_RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!_*
Fnaf related Style theory: what is actually going on with the springlock suits and how would they work in real life
I want matt in the movie lol
matpat you are awesome
HIIIIII
Wassup
how is there 30k views if the vid is 20 min long but the video was posted 10 min ago??
you slid that advertisement in so well lol
When you can't seem to agree with the theory 🥲
At least the movie Fnaf would be easier to follow/theorized since it's stated that Scott is only going to do Fnaf 1-3.
Can't wait for the next timeline after this movie has a 5 second cameo or something that breaks the lore.
This was only posted 11 min ago💀👍
Matpat was waiting forever to get FNaF on film theory
This was a really interesting theory. Keep up the good work!
The beginning tells me that Matpat lacks experience with how many cookbooks there are.  If it exists as a medium, it has a cookbook.  Halo? Cookbook. Fallout? Cookbook. Eldritch Horrors? The Necronomnomnom.
You have solved life.
I love the music
Yaay! 0:45 also, FNAF COOKBOOK???
If you truly want to infect all your channels with FNaF, feature the game merch and do a video on wether merch is cool or not
I think the "remnant extractor" is just the mechanism that allows the mask to lock into the Endo skeleton
I’m going as the purple guy himself
they actually filmed this movie right next to my house!! I got to see the set and some of the film moments, it was really cool! 🎉
Matpat do more wally theory i love that
fun fact: no-one that has commented now hasn't watched the whole viedo
i really hate fnaf. it doesn't deserve a tenth of the attention it gets
i love the fact that the video starts out with Film Thoery Matpat saying "its finally my turn..." AHAHAHAHAH that is peak !
Heedless
FNAF is spreading
I come from the future. He didn’t solve it. If I tell you how, the space time continuum will collapse.
Bro is singlehandedly gonna bring down the whole film industry if this keeps up
Ok
GOOD GOD MR PAT WAIT TILL ITS OUT
DO RICK AND MORRTY FILM
wow this finally came out
imagine the release changes to 2024
I’m really hoping this movie won’t disappoint!
Fnaf 1
interesting.
Google meet? How unexpected
bro found the lore of the fnaf movie before it even came out 😭😭
It didn’t even come out yet relax 😭
28,000th
This video will go down as one of the biggest crossover, from game theory to film theory, in history
Matpat, maybe scooper from Sister Location
I feel like Abby will turn to golden Freddy I don’t know alright I’m just guessing
2:35 have you thought this could have been the scooper prototype?
Dude chill the movie isn’t even close to out yet you remember what happened to securitybreach
I HAVE BEVER CLICK ON THIS SOO FAST
Here is a theory mat in your last video you pointed out how Gregory is sorta connected to the V.A.N.N.I network and since helpi is helping run it what if helpi purposely killed Cassie 🤔
This man’s thinks he’s ahead of this game 😭😭😭
Half of the movie is gonna be changed Ina month time now
YAY 🎉
My theory is that the restraints that he gets is the explanation for y he doesnt move in the games
Sponsorship over at 11:07
fnaf on film theory it butifle
bro missed an opportunity to start the video with "It's been so long"
Oh no! Fnaf virus is spreading over any other Matpat channel:O
Hi
Omg can’t wait
I can’t believe someone banged matpat on the head causing him to put FNAF on film theory
Ah yes the FNAF cookbook where the jumpscare is the food poisoning it'll give you
Now you need to connect the movie with the with the games in a full timeline   :)
I've been looking forward to this. 😃
I can always count on Matpat to do the work for me.
I really hope to movie is at least a 9
It's spreading
0:18 that was truly scary!!!. Geez, Matt Pat, calm down!!!
the fnaf theorist
Love you videos
This is the earliest ive seen a film theory
Get your hour tickets now🎉
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm so sad in Italy it comes out on the 8th of November 😭😭😭
Can't wait for the movie! And I'm really hoping they add the FNaF 1 Song.
PEETA IS IN FNAF?! HOLY SHAWT
google meet sponsor ?? 😭😭😭
THE MOVIE ISNT EVEN OUT YET!
Dear Matthew Patrick, YOU CAN'T SAY YOU SOLVED THE #*%^ING FNAF MOVIE UNTIL ITS OUT
Today is momentous day. Five Nights at Freddy's has officially come to Film Theory.
Humhumhumhumhunhun
It feels so great to see FNaF finally on the film theory channel
0:10 ITS BEEN SO LONG AND AS I SING MY SONG
Really wish they added Markipler in this movie because he’s the KING 👑 of five night at Freddy’s
Bro I’m the thousandth comment and it’s only been 8 minutes💀💀💀
It was only a matter of time I guess... now we're on for an inevitable theory !
You know it's a theory when mat pat posts a video, a film thoery
When it’s matpat theorising about fnaf  I don’t have to think . I just click
So surreal. Matpat actually made a *FILM* Theory video about fnaf. Let me repeat that. Matpat actually made a *FILM* Theory about fnaf. The movie is actually right around the corner and I am not ready
8 minutes ago and 968 comments already? Make it 969
Fnaf cookbook? Lets hope William Afton didn't write it or we'd be eating children for dinner.
when is bonnie vs freddy coming
yoo im so exited
you know golden freddy  could be william afton
matpat you are impatient. wait for it to come out bro!
I mean, it's not impossible for a 90s cop and a 2030s security guard/possessed murderer to share the a first name and hair style/colour😐 it doesn't necessarily have to mean something.
Is bro a time traveler?!
YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH DAB ME UP EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hi matmap l love your vidios an l hav ben a fan sinc 2014 stei strong : ]
idk hoow i got here 7 minutes after it posted, but question do yall think the movie is actually gonna be good?
2:54 basically a xp farm
The video came out 7 minutes ago and I got here in 30 seconds.
It’s not even out
a few mins ago
The first and probably only time I’ll be seeing a Fnaf video on this channel.
Omg, it's coming out on my birthday!!!
Dam what is this mrbeast levels of commenting speed
Early
943th
7 mins ago
He he mats gone insaaaaaaaaane along with his audience but... We love it anyway
Finally! The answer to the question I’ve been asking for years, he’s covering the FNaF movie on film theory.
Doing a plank while watching this starting from now adding one min is one like.
I don't blame Mike for wanting to go to Nebraska. Nothing much goes on here so it's quite peaceful, if you go to the right places
"Huh. Mat's film theory video is late this week. I wonder what-" "Oh."
Ive waited years for a fnaf flim theory episode
"Mum wake up mat pat's going mad again..."
it's amazing how he can solve it again after losing his sanity, before it's out, as expected
"FIVE NASTY AHH FOOLS!" OH NO ITS A "BREACH" QUICK SOMEONE CALL "SECURITY" OH NO NOW EVERYTHINGS "RUINED"
YAAAAAAA
Har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har
That's great now let's hope they don't pull a BATIM 😂
I’m early 😁
Five nights at feddy’s
how the f are you already making a theory
I always come back.
I've already got an idea for style theory How good would an animatronic suit be for hiding a dead body? Asking for a friend..
IT'S HERE
Yoooooo
omg I clicked so fast-
.
We need like 100 more videos to have solved FNAF 😂  we want… no… we NEED more lol
FNAF has finally made it to the Film Theory channel !! Hard to believe it was a mere indie game only a few years ago
4 minuets ago. Soonest I've ever seen an upload without notifications
Sure man
Never thought I would see a fnaf theory on film theory
within hour group here
I always love to see film theory taking another thing from game theory´s toy box
Oh boy. Matpats lost it again.
fafn
I've been waiting since 2014 for this moment.
Let's see if this prediction is right Mat. Unlike a few other times
Is Mike not Michael Afton? I’m confused.
Am i the only one who thinks that thing with the saws it a mask and thats the gears that they phone guy warned us about
sup
they should've put you in the movie
It's not even out yet😨
Another fnaf
I’d love to see you guys tackle the Marble Hornets series! It’s not ongoing, but it’s one of the classics ARGs that revolutionized the horror genre for years!
742nd comment
2:04 I don't think anyone expects a happy ending. This is FNaF after all.
Thanks for spoilers!
I have a theory. Game theory and film theory matpat are seperate entities. Food and fashion theory are a The same mat
he is at it agen
This has been awaited for a long time
Hr5j
Bro what the movie isn't out yet
Yay A New Video!
E
REHEEHHEHEHEHEHEHE
The Fnaf theory quadrents have been completed! IT's BEEN SO LONG!
854th comment😂
Lol the movie isnt even out yet, but I can tell Mat is READDDDYYYYYY
Why google meets?
Man hit us with that Matt pat Jump scare😂
Bro figured it out, before the movie even came out...  If it turns out (like some of the fnaf sister location predictions) that this will be mostly right, Then Congrats to the team!
Let see if this theory in mouth will approve right or horrible disapprove
It feels weird to be this early
💅💃
12,479th
scott is watching this, knowing this time he cant switch the entire lore to make the theory obsolete
I haven't watched this video yet and I don't know if I want to should I spoil the movie for me or should I not
Matpat: i finally solved FNAF today!  FNAF sucker punch: Nope
MAT PAT CREATING THE VIDEO ABOUT THE FNAF MOVIE THAT NOBODY ASKED FOR,BUT VERY MUCH NEEDED
Holy shid! A fnaf theory on the film theory channel!
No matter where he hides FNaF always follows him
i literally just came back from school and there's already a theory on the fnaf movie... you are a different breed of humanity matpat.
If MattPatt isn’t in the movie we need to riot
He’s gonna ruin it before I see it
Things I think that would be cool for fnaf.  1. A fnaf 2d animated series  2 a fnaf webcomic series with lore  3. A fnaf reboot with all the games becoming 3d and free roam, and with more lore and some changes.  4. A fnaf game about playing as Henry Emily setting up the events of fnaf 6 pizzeria trap.  5. A new graphic novel series.  6. A fnaf game about playing as a animatronic.  7. A fnaf game about ghost hunters and paranormal investigators.  8. A fnaf puzzle or board game with actual lore.  9. A fnaf game about rival businesses to fazbear entertainment.  10. New fnaf spinoff games with lore and stuff.
Only in Nebraska ngl
martpat can plasde do skibdsi toeilt film thjeory pelase?
Hi

Autisn
The biggest mystery to the FnaF movie is why you didn’t have a cameo in it. It’s a shame 😢
Google meat
I do like hearing MatPat explaining FNaF like he didn’t spend over half a decade destroying his sanity over the franchise.
Now he just need to get Fnaf on style theory and then Fnaf has invaded all of his channels

MatPat solving the FNAF movie, let's go! 😆
OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!! A fnaf theory FINALLY ON film theory!!!!
If u see this comment like for no reason. 1 mnute ago jeez!
Good theory
hii matpat, i love your videos, keep up the amazing work ^^
1 mins
e
He has no chill
you know its serious when its the first film theory fnaf video
E
Matpat is always  there to avoid us from buying movie tickets
I swear FNAF is going to drive MatPat insane one day 😭
I watch every matpat video but I literally clicked so fast when I saw a fnaf film theory
Cool
Fancy
Watching Fnaf theory on The Film Theorists channel was not something i would expect
No way...
Who else can’t wait for the fnaf film! 👇
he couldn't wait one more month to spread the name of fnaf to film theory 😭
getting sponsored by google is crazy
Here now
I can’t believe we finally get a fnaf video on film theory 😱
Matpat please make a theory about Emesis Blue it's a good Animation Movie on YouTube. And if asking no I'm not a bot.
Beans
It isn't even out yet bro 😭😭
Yeah sure Matpat, congrats 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bro solved fnaf movie before fnaf movie 💀💀💀💀💀💀
uwu
Wow,  I’m surprised at the amount of comments already… its only been out 1 minute
Not even film theory can survive fnaf theories!!
How have you already solved it, Matpat your insane! It's not even out yet!
SO EARLY ALSO GREAT THEORY MAT EVEN THO I HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YET IT'S SO GOOD
Be careful Matpat, don't want to ruin the movie for some 👀¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯
Im convinced that MatPat owns a Time-Stone💀
Could u do my theory from ur latest vid? :> (not this one)
MatPat… I thought we learned from our mistakes. Haven’t we learned from previous movie theories that predicting a movies ending only results in disaster? And the FNAF MOVIE  of all movies?! MATPAT?????
lets go matpat with the futuresight haki
Fnaf is finally spreading to the other channels. I cant wait for how freddys pizza would actually taste on food theory and the science on how the animatronic springlocks work on style theory!
Oh god, more fnaf for him to research-
if it wasn't official before, it is now: MatPat has become a Marvel fan for solving a movie that's not even out yet 😆
I love seeing MatPat slowly become more and more unhinged with the theories. We love you Team Theorist!! ❤
Hi

HEY
