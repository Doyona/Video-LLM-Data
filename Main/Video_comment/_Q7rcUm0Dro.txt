Something about strapping someone to a chair with a gun to their head connected to a mechanism attached to the door so that when a third party opens the doorthe gun shorts the person strapped to the chair 🤔 effectively causing the unsuspecting door opener to partake in the murder of a loved one and have eternal guilt or something....   Yeah nah, I see it

*whispering* "do you think they purchased my kid .....thats not his as a mfing slave?" "Um ...it would appear that way wouldn't it.....".
"so there's no chance?" ....."uh I'm kinda grossed out sorry after I leave this time I will stop calling ok...that finished it....you should give her whatever leftovers you have and i mean i guess if you paid to fuck our kid ummm 🤔  that's weird It makes me wanna barf.... if their forcing us to let you both fuck our kid I guess I can have more. I think you prolly have to die so you can't molest a kid that ain't even his. We want the judge in jail for this shit" "he landed upside down....holy shit yikes" *looking all the way up* "You're a tall fella. I would be pissed too and blue?"...."they forced him into that"
"you not understanding" *read my fuckin lips*  "I had 2"

This is a masterpiece from Nicky Minaj ❤
Are there any similar songs I can listen to?
She got the capacity of an ashtray been used 1000 times. She can rap & sing like a master. This gave me a smooth feeling in my mind. I heard her music, she can do more than people say. Even if she may not seem present all the time. She's the queen truthfully. ❤
What Wayne say about diddy ?
Drake verse the weakest honestly. But still 🔥🔥🔥
❤
Looking back on this song Nikki didn’t have to kill them boys like that
I miss this collaboration 💯🤲🦉good music
Niki verse ❤❤
Here after Carter 6, he still up there as the GOAT
I’m 42 an no woman EVER on earth 🌍 in any generation was better then her at rapping… she’s literally the best female rapper EVER ! An looks good too smh too 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the morning like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doing damage, you just hyping me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringing me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the GOAT Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seeing things when I was seeing green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

You see how life goes. Unfortunately everyone is at risk. Did you know even in secret societies that if they are too close to me that there life is on the line for the mere fact that they are associated with me yet because nothing gets in between the missions that are presented to them sad but facts why I stay away from others to save them

All verses hit, but Nicki comes hard AF. Haven't heard a female rapper come like that since the Queen "Can't forget New Jersey..."
I hate i never got credit for my beat 😩😩
What up i came harder then borh them i killed that dhit i dont care how you got the bodying of little wine i said it it lets keep going get the trash out the way i share all royalty with  artist who would want there life and bad with the good in public thaks for showing me i see theee legged men
You are who you thought you were Drake. I still don’t think you lost the rap beef. you represented yourself well in everything you did. you just got a bunch of punks that react to things trying to control the narrative. Keep that in mind before you give these weak boys a platform ever again. You steal the highest extremely rapper of 2024, but you took an L supposedly make it make sense…. you’re too big for that don’t punch down to those hoes anymore.
We are all so impressed by u and ur work! 🎉
🍀☘️🍀
🦅🦅🦅
Would be so much better with out drake and Nikki just my opinion i turning off after wayne
Wayne is the peoples champ.
One of my fav Nicki songs of all time. Wayne went Brazzy!

❤❤🇷🇼🇺🇸👌
Nicki killed em both no lie
Nikki was the weak link she did not even belong on the fuckin song!! And Wayne seem like he started to rap too fast but he did what he had to do!! Now Drake what can I say about Drake He's so great!! He's been putting that whole fucking label on his back like a book bag for over 10 years he actually made the song a banger with his magnificent concepts of metaphors content of style and flow!! This was a good song but Nikki bum ass did not deserve to be on here she must have been high that day ( I'm not surprised)!!
Drakes verse doesn’t land the same after the lawsuits & big L. He got on the track with onikka mirage and died just like he said
Had to come to this .. sounded too familiar .. yeah5x don trip & starlito 🔥🔥🔥 if u haven’t heard it give it a listen ^^

Wayne will go down as the greatest lyricist of all time hands down. A lyrical masterpiece/ genius.
🐐+🐐+🐐
I did 48 minutes on torn meniscus, who’s subbing 🔥🔥🔥💪
Yall three need to revisit this energy plus more wayne with you having this super bowl situation. Nikki usual type of lil problems she went on hiatus n dropped her album earlier this year n all the girlies trying to do there big one. So talk big to em nikki  pf2 coming soon.  Drake u got beef with kendrick n law suit with umg n Sony you have made more n worked more but your original team nikki wayne still have the skills. A reunion could help all you greatly...carry-on
Wayne n Nicki shoulda did a joint tape like Jay n Bey
When the alpha and omega both pulverize this is what happens
Wayne went so hard 🔥
If not for the Social Media criticizing EVERYTHING this song would've taken off like it should've
Lil wayne is just the best period
2025 anybody
Heather hedley in my mind sample
Drake carried this mf like Ashton Jeanty
Homeboy I met in county enjoy running over the top of my head like they did him when he was locked up. Revolving door.
Big 3🫶🏻🙌🏻
Nicki carried the whole song
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1.50x speed 😮
The beat maker needs to ve well compensated and acknowledged... Amazing beat
Never sleep on WEEZY!!!! 😎😎😎
Onika 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Living legend lil  wayne 🐐

“ Wanna see my niggas ball so bad , I started up a league “ ⚠️
Wayne is a FUCKING MONSTER. If my life ever depended on a freestyle rap battle. I would want DMX. But...😔 after him its Wayne all day. My boy is one of the few that carried the business for awhile.

Wayne the goat  spits the best punch line hands downs
Who owns the publishing on the instrumental? Cuz I dint even see a step brothers mention in the credits much less a lil drop in the vs js this Minaj direct channel this “version” has 31 million views step brothers should be getting a piece of that imho idk legally or if they are….
Tryna run the country like Putin one day, but who's rushin' (Russian) 🤮🔥

August 8 2024
I'm surprised Cam or Juelz didn't jump on this beat
Nickis verse:  Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene.

Nicki is a monster !!!!
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe 👏👏👏
I want to give a shout out to Nicki Minaj on the verse of this song. She always been a fly beautiful queen especially when she spit her razor lyrics but I'm just floating on her lyrics right now so at the same time with clouded mind. I like when she said that she bought a car not to drive it but walk around it!!!! That's Superstar Playgirl type five star chick would spit!!!..  "That was boss of she say in all her lyrics"♥️💯👑💥💥💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💨💨💨💨💨🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👍💰💰💰😉🙏

I hate drake but I listen to him when he’s on the track with Wayne and Nicki
A real live 🐐 💐💐👌🏿
This is a drake kinda beat

Wayne had the best verse by far..He said " Leave the keys to ur heart next to ur soul and ur spirit some see graffiti as art some can see hoes to be women, but im the greediest shark amongst a ocean of killers I'll put u 6 feet deep im being socially distance". The crazy part is he doesn't even write his verses anymore. I think hes the best rapper ever, hes been rapping since 95 thats almost 30 years and hes still hott thats why i feel hes the goat
Man who asked yall

2💰24
They really like that
🥏🥏🥏
This is one of Nicki’s greatest verses of all time. She literally masters and rides the beat to perfection. She is the best female rapper alive . This ain’t up for debate. This is coming from a non/barb. She is definitely the Queen and I’m from the lil Kim error who is my favorite female rapper. ❤❤❤ Salute and respect
Nicki Minaj Queen of rap forever and ever ❤
Damn yall hate to give that man Drake his credit knowing he washed them on the track respectfully 😂
The whole song 🔥🔥 but the "CORPORATE GIANTS AND MACHINES THAT WENT AGAINST ME" 🤔🤔🤔
Wayne Nicki and drake oh man the trio I’m glad I grew up listening to them the goats right hereeeeee lyrical genius’s
Drake fucked this song up. His lame ah
When I am at my lowest, depressed, sad… Nicki verse speaks to my SPIRIT! and get TF up and Go harder !!  🙌🏾
Ain’t this the best they stole from that dude ? Trizzy ….?? He is so popular when he made this original beat and y’all just stole it smfh
this literally that twitter beat but worse
2024 wya
Dammit ‼️ Everybody slapped TF out this track ‼️ takes me back to sophomore/junior days, when everything was genuinely OK. 💯💯
“My bitch Dance better than P.diddys -Wayne
Sad we never got a videoclip😭
aint no C in GREEN ... but im seeing green,,,
One of the most underrated songs ever, and Nikki verse was one of (if)the best by a female rapper.
No hook 🪝 needed
You Get it, He had Two, And he had too, You Get It. 🔥 🔥 ⛽️ ⛽️ 💥 💥
Wayne and Nicki verse is why I keep coming back
Did anybody else catch Drake saying, “All the meetings in person  so they can’t prove nothing…” 🤨🤨😬😑
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Weezy definitely carried this song🏆
Nicki IS the reason why I listen to this. Her verse in this song is by far my favorite of hers.
Matrix she said machines went against me
When the world is on the brink of destruction and all hope is lost then the theme music of the super heroes starts and they pull up to save the day and actually save it😂🔥🔥
Sheesh this intro slept on  Nicki and Wayne 🔥🔥🔥
My grandmother passed away last year on the 25th of December I used to play this song she loved it❤❤❤❤❤❤I miss her everyday
The Real Big 3
Nicki's part is fiiiiiiiiire🔥
the beginning was alarming
Wayne went dumb top ten goat 🐐
111....the three0
This beat is stuuuuuid fire and that’s not even close to the crazy bars everyone dropin on this track. This easily song of the year
She ball in any arena go let the fans in 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wayne said, “ I wore a gat before a tattoo/ I had too/ as a matter fact, I had two/,🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥/ I love when lyricist use double entendre’s
All 3 of them are Rap Gods ❤❤❤
YM for life! Ima be honest and say Wayne washed Nicki and Drake 😂😂 I’m so sorry! Then Nicki washed Drake and Drake didn’t come hard on this one he got washed
“You neighbors can’t trouble me from the DoubleTree, step your suites up.” 🏨
PASTRAMI🗣️‼️🗣️‼️

WEEZY F BABY...
Ama badonkadonk in bikini fiend 🤯🤯🥶
If they never link up again, it was worth it

I think nicki talks about food in her verses more than rick ross
Nicki is the Queen of Rap 🎉 #pinkfriday
YOUNG LION. YMCB.
Nah wtf did wayne mean when he said his bih aint better then p diddy😂😂😂

dont let people tell you hiss was the first shot, shes been simmering for 3 years
Boring instrumental
Been thinking about drake's bar for a few days because I knew I've heard it before somewhere before and it just clicked that  It's from Jayz -Girls Girls Part 2.  "Who you huggin , who you wanna be lovin? "  Drake's verse just about , like just is just about above lil wayne for me. Nicki's verse was weak.
This is something different, Wayne and Nicky spazzed and Drake just sent it home beautifully. The energy is palpable, it’s like a victory lap.   Also RIP Nip 🏁
🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ “ my bitch ain’t better then p diddys” that shit went over all our heads way before the lawsuit
Nicki Minaj Pink Friday 6 ep out now 🎉❤
Legend holds that 4 or 5 more rappers lined up for this track, but after the dust settled from Wayne, only Nicki and Drake were left.
After two years i listened carefully and OMG lil Wayne snapped.
Still here in 2024!!
Damn Wayne went stupid hard on this..
Wayne is unmatched as always
Nicki minaj the only female rapper i respect and enjoy listening to ❤
I’m trynna run the country like putin one day but who’s rushin ? that line was crazy.
nicki will forever be an enigma above all
Nikki sound Soo sexy ❤️👋👋👋💥🔥👑👌😊
drake and wayne in my top5 personal favorites but niki had the best verse and its not even close
Wayne u are the best ever
Seeing green but still pissing lean.
This is elite lyricism from Lil Wayne.
They all killed it but lil Wayne verse is un matched
2024 nn still listening to this
Stolen song

Listening to this song feels like victory. It makes me feel like I just WON.
2024 still here Oan Drake murdered them
Anyone came after  the thread on twitter with the context and realize how lethal Nicki verse is ?
Ever since the pandemic in 2009?
Drake best verse
It’s crazy cuz most people don’t know Jeezy used this sample back in 08 and that shit was super 🔥 to
still crazy you can hear when wayne actually takes off the balenci mask
I understand everything Nicki is saying. She has grown on me & I consider her as one of the greatest Female MCs of the 2010’s . She still far away from Kim, Foxy, Salt & Pepa, Remy Ma, among others but she’s getting close. Love this song & I hope she continues to grow!!!
Wayne killed this str8 🔥🔥🔥 respect from Scotland
nicki don killed this shiiiiiiii*
PEPPERONI PROVALONE PASTRAMIIII
Romans 14:17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
i just love the sample. that “yeah yeah yeah” that’s playing in the background. ❤ Shout out to Heather Headley -In My Mind.
Most underrated line lil Wayne had was when he was rapping as if something was covering his mouth then said let me take this balenciaga mask off then he clears up 🤯
Drake carried this shit
This might be the greatest verse of all time
The song sampled is perfectly looped. 😭😭
They shoulda made Wayne go last 😂 i just change it after his verse.

Salute to Heather Headley for this sample. If you know, you know.

When Nicki said her butt will cause a riot and after watching her on Kai Cenats stream, watching mfs fight to the death to sniff the spot she was sitting 😂😂 I'd say her bars stood the test of time.

The producer snapped so hard 🔥🔥🔥
ONLY THE DEMONS WOULD UNDERSTAND WHEW PURE DEMONS
The OG Barbie ❤❤
This the hardest thing bro 😭😭😭
lil Wayne is something else sheesh
Has anyone noticed how in drakes verse the sample is slightly changed? The “yeah, yeah, yeah” is slightly drawn out longer.
Camden😜
10/10
Nicki the only rapper to even somewhat stick up with the goats since lauryn hill
No didout, say word...
Respect Weezy F if you’re seeing this in 2060
If Wayne stick to this flow and drop each month he would get the world back!!!!
Yall some drama queens foreal
Wayne the greatest to ever do it this verse proves it (Not saying the thousands of other verse he spit didn't already solidify him but you  get the point) wayne the goat period
To be fair Wayne and drake carried this beat
Nicki was trash ass always 😅
That boy said i’m a pull up so lit I just might crash dog let me take this Balenciaga mask off (voice gets louder and clearer) to ask y’all who asked y’all? 🔥🔥🔥 this man started rapping with a fucking mask on and took it off in the middle of his verse.🤯😱 Goated 🐐
When I hear this song I wanna cry happiness 🥹🔥
No on bih can b my opp that shit offends meee !!! AHHHHHHH
Wayne super cold 🥶 on this joint....they all snapped something serious ...classic 🔥
My lil hoe out Atlanta got hoe out Atlanta. Yea this Va talkin too. Y’all don’t like they way we do it holla at us. We get straight too it.
Omg this song is perfect !! Still obsessed
“paw paw paw paw paw he was a good cat my bad dawg”😭😭😭😭😭🫵🏽
Drake really him
❤ this big 3🎉🎉
This song was stolen from datrack addict
Still here 🩷💪🏾
Nicki did her shit this songs is the definition of a 3 headed goat
I’ll put you 6 feet deep I’m being socially distant 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Drake is a fucking problem
2:14
Am the greediest shark among a ocean of killers ⚔️
BEST YM SONG EVER🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wayne's verse is legendary since Cinderella lost her glass shoe get outta here
The bars
TO THIS VERY DAY!!!!   I GO BACK TO THIS SONG TO APPRECIATE WHERE ALL 3 ARTISTS CAME FROM, YESSS I AM SHOUTING, BUT THATS ONLY BECAUSE WE WISH THEY RAPPED LIKE THIS TODAY!! #100
I like how everyone says this is Nicki's best verse. I always thought she was overrated and y'all just proved it. Her "best" is mid
This officially my favorite Nicki bar. She spoke as a conglomerate
ещё 2 миллиона и будет 30 миллионов
This is like legit amazing....and that word carries weight.  WOW what a track ☠️🥵
omw of. y personal fav records. Weezy came down wreckin
U have to give Nikki her flowers because she can rap. She’s the best
Lil Wayne is the fucking goat!!
That still can’t fuck with Nicki! Real talk! Don’t argue me😤🦍💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Wayne went crazy man
This nigga said “some see graffiti as art, some can see hoes to be women” that’s probably one of the best bars I ever heard
Jiraya, tsunade, orchimaru 😂 🔥
Wayne was fire on this one though
This song!! i love it
This trio shut the game down for almost 20 years as a collective. ❤❤❤ wayne nikki drake. 2008 seems like yesterday.
Now I need J. Cole and KDot to remix this
3:50 GOAT Feature
Wayne and Nicki kill it. Reminds me of the song Bedrock. Why Drake is listed first is beyond me as his verse is meh as usual.
Only one verse on this mattered
Drake always bring a machine gun to a gun fight .
❤
I had to - Wayne
Even with them floor seats they couldn't see the Team!!🔥🔥🔥
Ima pull up so lit I just might crash dogg 😂
Old school Wayne 💯
Wheezy lol YOU THE 🏆🙌🏾 BEST AN I TOLD THEM FROM TIME 🎉😂💯🎶 my man said we get iT lol
I feel that buy a new car just to walk around it. THAT FEELS GOOD when you can finally own something.
so i'm the only one who hears the clarity change in Lil Wayne's verse as he says "lemme take this balenciaga mask off"?
How’d I go from bars on the screen door to bars on the tv screen!!!   The resurrection is a fact 🥹🥹
Waynes verse is still one of my favorites over the last 5 years
still in luv w this
This is like a perfect song. They all did their thing
I came back to listen to a classic
Could listen to this at my lowest low and my highest high, hope everyone is blessed 🔥
❤💕
Nicki ate
Goddammit this is terrible! My ears just committed suicide!
Top 5 greatest wayne verse
This brought me back to that old Wayne. Nostalgia
She's the star , icon ,Queen ,the best to ever do this shit
Nicki Minaj is the queen guys this slaps hard❤❤❤❤2023 july
Ask what the state color is
Ngl I listen to this song just for Lil Wayne’s verse
"No one bitch could be my opp that shit offends me, It's corporate giants and machines that went against me"😭🧎
Drake carried
nicki was weak on this song
❤❤❤
Tha 44 is my MISTER.
That beat is Heather headley in my mind ❤
📶📶📶
She just uploaded a remix Trina 😅
It's like nicki shitted on me after graduation from high school private school gigi willimez HCA 😂

Fun fact! Wayne was actually smoking tarantula and he literally took off his balanciaga mask off to ask us "who asked y'all?"
These bitches still my sons! 😢 mmm

Sampled the Harmony from Header Headly “In my mind"
Nicki went the hardest!
She got bodied by Wayne

that one drake line did not age well.....
Man drake spit them facts hard😮dude really started a league.. Dude said 6 gee oh dee.. Ymcmb.. Killed and i ain't even speaking on that better in the morning like a slice of pizza😮
Yall better give dj track addict his flowers! Shamefull beat heist if there ever was one
Yo Wayne made the whole song.  Like wow his lyrics. Straight up. Nikki said some good bars. Predictable but I call a spade a spade. She did what she had to and blew.

This is one of the greatest verses of all time to me that Nicki has done. There is not a female on earth that can touch these bars!!! And this coming from a non-barb. The facts are facts !!! Don’t come under my post trying to argue. I said what I said and meant it 💯
I’m still not over this
Whoever did this!!!!!!!!!
Drake,s part wasn't needed
All three going back to their roots. Like: "let’s kill this beat without a whole concept"… as we all know they grew up together so this song is very special
Wow! Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, and Drake can all spit their rhymes very well.
PASTRAMI…PASTRAMI

“These bitches time tik toking better stick to dancing.”

Vâng, chờ đã, hmm Tôi là kéo lên rất nhẹ, tôi chỉ có thể sụp đổ, dawg Hãy để tôi tháo chiếc mặt nạ Balenciaga này ra và hỏi các bạn, "Ai đã hỏi các bạn vậy?" Thấy chưa, họ bảo tôi đóng thế cái mông của tôi, và thế thôi Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, anh ấy là một con mèo tốt, xấu của tôi, dawg Đừng bỏ K sau chữ B đó, cậu bé, cuộc gọi tồi tệ, đó là nói chuyện cờ Chết tiệt và hạ cờ của bạn đi, tôi đã phải Tôi đã mặc một Gat trước khi xăm, tôi phải Trên thực tế, tôi đã có hai Không giới hạn, tôi đang dùng viên nang, tôi đã tái nghiện, boo Nhưng tôi đã đứng vững kể từ khi Lọ Lem đánh mất chiếc giày thủy tinh Màu xanh tiền mặt, nhưng tôi vẫn thấy màu xanh lá cây Tôi đang ở trong phòng tắm, và tôi đang đi tiểu Con chó cái của tôi hút chân không, tôi nói với cô ấy, "Hãy giữ cho tôi sạch sẽ", khung cảnh thanh bình Tôi là một badonkadonk và yêu thích bikini Tôi chỉ cần một nữ hoàng không sợ làm tình với Stephen King Tôi từng sống cạnh nhà Drake và Momma Dee Và Lisa Dee trên phố Eagle Làm cách nào để tôi đi từ các thanh trên cửa lưới đến màn hình TV? Đừng hỏi tôi, nhưng đừng bao giờ chuyển kênh Vải nỉ Gucci, vớ Gucci, dép Gucci Gấu bông Gucci và gấu trúc, không giả Tuyên truyền thổi tắt nến My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta Với một cuộc dạo chơi Atlanta, cô ấy một cuộc dạo chơi Atlanta Chúng tôi hiểu rồi, nó giống nhau ở mỗi thành phố Con đĩ của tôi nhảy giỏi hơn của P. Diddy Và kể từ khi đại dịch Họ không muốn để Drake ra khỏi Canada Tôi đã hét lên, "Free Drizzy" Tôi biết bae tin vào tầm nhìn của tôi nhưng không muốn tôi nhìn thấy nhà tù Nói: "Tôi không thể hứa hẹn, hoặc rời đi hoặc đến thăm Nhưng hãy để chìa khóa trái tim của bạn bên cạnh linh hồn và tinh thần của bạn" Một số coi graffiti là nghệ thuật, một số có thể coi cuốc là phụ nữ Nhưng tôi là con cá mập tham lam nhất giữa đại dương sát thủ Tôi đặt bạn sâu sáu feet, tôi đang xa cách xã hội Nina Ross bên hông, khẩu .44 là tình nhân của tôi Cảnh quay bổ sung, clip bổ sung, video không nói chuyện hay vixens Chỉ cần đến và xem về nó, bitch tunechi Ayo, tôi là ngôi sao trong bất kỳ căn phòng nào tôi đứng Tôi là người nổi bật, bạn chỉ là chỗ dựa của tôi Những con điếm này sao chép bài tập về nhà của tôi, đó là những gì chúng nộp Đó là lý do tại sao tôi riêng tư như những sân bay tôi hạ cánh Cuộc đời là ngôi nhà bên bờ biển, đừng để cát vào Tôi đánh bóng ở bất kỳ đấu trường nào, hãy để người hâm mộ vào Tôi nên đi cảnh sát một chiếc áo đấu mới, đó là lời của Camden Những con điếm này 'time tick-tockin', tốt hơn hết là nhảy múa Tôi D&G chiếc ví, tiền của tôi cao và đẹp Sân sau rộng lớn, chỉ để Papa Bear có thể vui đùa Một bánh pizza Margarita với Parmesan và tỏi Những con điếm khát nước, tôi có thể hiểu tại sao chúng nghiện rượu Không phải bao giờ nói về nó khi bạn đang về nó Mới mua xe mới, không phải để lái mà để dạo phố Cứ gọi tôi là Nicki, gà mờ, Minaj im lặng Maserati vani hoàn toàn mới, tôi là Häagen-Dazsin' Anh ấy gọi tôi là rắn mặc dù tôi đang nhỏ giọt, ăn kiêng nước Big bootin' ra, Daisy Dukes của tôi sẽ gây náo loạn Những con chó cái này vẫn là con trai của tôi, ai có thể từ chối nó? Các gói của tôi khác nhau, ai có thể cung cấp cho nó? Không một con chó cái nào có thể là đối thủ của tôi, điều đó làm tôi khó chịu Chính những công ty khổng lồ và máy móc đã chống lại tôi Tôi rửa chó cái, anh bạn, họ thậm chí không thể rửa cho tôi Cô ấy nói cô ấy hấp dẫn, tôi nói, "Chà, con khốn, đến và thuyết phục tôi" Không phải là không có C trong màu xanh lá cây, nhưng tôi đang nhìn thấy màu xanh lá cây Ngay cả khi họ ngồi trên sàn, họ cũng không thể nhìn thấy đội K-I-N-G, G.O.A.T., cộng với tôi, Nữ hoàng Tôi gửi ảnh, gửi chúng trở lại hoặc chạy trốn khỏi hiện trường Bạn biết đấy, một trong những mối nguy hiểm của việc kiếm tiền Là bạn có thể đủ khả năng để được ấn tượng Y'all một số nữ hoàng phim truyền hình, thực sự Tất cả đều tốt, mặc dù Bây giờ bạn đã điều chỉnh lớn nhất từ ​​trước đến nay YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Thiên thần trẻ, Sư tử trẻ, đàn ông Tất cả các chàng trai hãy cùng theo dõi với Onika Maraj Và tất cả các bạn vẫn đang chết, ' anh bạn, phải không? Chúng tôi trong con chó cái này Đây không phải là lần đầu tiên tôi làm những con số trên hai cây nạng Nhìn thấy nhiều mảng bám hơn bàn chải đánh răng Cho đến khi tôi ở cánh cổng trắng như ngọc trai, tôi phải di chuyển một cái gì đó, làm một cái gì đó Tất cả các cuộc họp diễn ra trực tiếp, vì vậy họ không thể chứng minh điều gì Quen em tám năm rồi mà vẫn địt em như chồng mới Tryna điều hành một đất nước như Putin một ngày nào đó, nhưng ai vội vàng Ai đang bịp bợm? Cho thật Bạn đang ôm ai? Bạn muốn được yêu ai? Tôi chơi bốn mươi tám phút trên một khum bị rách, ai là người thay thế? El Chico sang trọng, muốn xem quả bóng niggas của tôi quá tệ, tôi đã bắt đầu một giải đấu Chết tiệt với tôi, bạn niggas không thể làm phiền tôi từ Doubletree Bước lên dãy phòng của bạn, tôi nhờ Oliver thiết lập nhịp đập 2021, tôi phải làm ướt đường phố Cô gái của bạn đã tốt hơn vào buổi sáng như một lát bánh pizza Đó là khi tôi phải đánh cô ấy bằng câu "Rất vui được gặp bạn" Bạn niggas nghĩ rằng bạn làm thiệt hại, bạn chỉ thổi phồng tôi lên Đối mặt với ai? Tôi có thể nhìn thấy bức tường của tất cả các bạn và chạy thẳng qua Hãy tin tưởng, đó là tất cả những trò chơi thú vị cho đến khi tôi cũng muốn chơi Ayy, dios mío, tảng băng trôi trên Chúa Giêsu, nó mang tôi đến gần Chúa hơn Tôi đã gần gũi với đám đông, tôi đã được biết đến với cái tên G.O.A.T Có thể thử và đến gần, nhưng bạn sẽ không, tôi đã

This song make me emotional because Nicki really is just a Legend and I'm soooooooooo happy to have been born in a Nicki World 😭🤍✨🖤 I love this woman to death!!!
Dream team 🔥🔥🔥 My opinion  jayz can't mess with drake perfect song
Drake killed this
Society is responsible not the victims of intentional distortion of the truth created by the evil that once and currently exist.
Assessing feelings and appreciating their creatively that people use to express their feelings. Weather said or understand. I expands the scope of understanding of how the world has warped their idea of achieving happiness or success.
Why didn't we use the original version of this beat?? Your missing the drum rolls and where's the snare he used???? This beat was epic!!!
I feel like a vet without a ring  A MVP without a team From my d.o.b. To my d.o.d. My j.o.b. Is to succeed I’m seeing green I see no evil Believe nothing I hear half of what I see tho I leave no stone unturned and solid like a rock I turn a good girl out and let her suck my cock Believe it or not I’m achieving allot  But I can’t stop won’t stop till we at the top
QUEEN 💓💓💓💓💓💓
wow 2nd time listening to this song and now it's one of my favorite 🥺💖
"Your girl was better in the morning like a slice of pizza" what yah know about that line???
If they woulda made a video for this it would easily have 100M+views

Like for frizzy tracks 🔥🔥🔥
Trizzytrack actually made the track something different. I guess we just nightcoring a track, and rapping over it. Low effort on the production side.
This man is damn near genius level. His wordplay is sick and it's on the spot. His timing is ill. I wish he would've done this track by himself on a new track. Still keeping this one though. They both spit fire too
LEAVING BACK 2022 MOVING FORWARD ONE💙💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜.

They need to to an album together
Nicki Minaj saved this song for real
It's very rare you have a collaboration with multiple Artists that everyone holds up their end of expectations, EXCEPT for when it includes "The Big Three" they understood the assignment...
Ah man i had to come back to this iconic song... pure talent...
the sound quality is so bad i want to cry
I feels good to hear from  Hiphop's  "Big 3" AKA "Trinity" its been awhile  .  YCMB Reminds me oF better times . Lil Wayne  "No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe🥿  Bravo👏
Starlito Yeah5x is better
How many times have yall listened to this?
😵
This record deserved a video 🥺
this is why Drake is slowly becoming  irrelevant because of lines like " I already packed a garage  non of them shits is a Dodge.. Wealth is lonely...
I used ro respect & enjoy Little Wayne, but I'd rather serve my deserved prison time than be bailed out by or kiss Trump's bigot azz.
I hated myself when I was younger... Nicki's music and her whole self taught me to hold my head high and to walk with a strut in my step...I grew up with her....she got me through hard (and homeless!) times.....
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥵🥵🥵🥵
🔥🔥🔥"No 1 bi**h could ever be my op, that s**t offends me, it's corporate giants and machines that went against me" 🔥🔥🔥
Doiiwn that album title hard
"It's cooperate giants and machines that went against me" these lines hit hard when now in 2022 Nicki mfing Minaj didn't even get nominated for a Grammy after she dominated the whole year.... *THE WHOLE YEAR* if that's not fighting against I don't know what else is. Nicki deserves so much and it pisses me off that these people *SCAMMY* don't give her her flowers.
It's from 2:16 for me 😭

Drake was being disrespectful for saying Nikki’s real name
"I wore a gat before a tattoo I had to matter fact I had 2" DWAYNE IS OUT HIS MIND
Woooo! And I’m still here!
Nicki had the worst verse but it was still fire. Just shows how crazy this song is
Skipping to Nicki’s part every time cause she served.
Craziest beat
Best goes super hard

Shout out to those who dont take handouts
Such a nostalgic song, I played this jam on repeat on my way to writing my qualifying exams that fortunately went well so this song always takes me to a good place
So pure on YouTube, bullshit on Apple Music.
Yo, how many times has nikki said in all her songs " these bitches still my sons"? 😆
Suh a timeless artwork.
"life is a beach house, don't let the sand in" man the love i have for nicki is unreal
HARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD

This beat at the end of the power show , where’s the beat originally from I’ve heard it before this song came out
Onika Tanya Maraj will forever remain the greatest female rapper ever.
Nicki ate
💐❤
" yeah yeah .. sonjaeh jeahh jeahh"
Danke für dieses lied ♡♡
Coldest MCs in the world!!!🎉 ❤
“Just bought a new car not to drive it but to walk around it” hottest verse of the year 🥵🔥💥na but for real though the beat is on point. What a waste that it was on Nicky Minajs track
nicki minaj ruined this song,... would be so much better with just lil wayne and drake
It's corporate giants n machines that went against me ...... that's fact no one could have defeated her one on one
❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The way Wayne started his verse maybe he do freestyle his shit cause it did clear up after the removing of the mask. Idk might be just me
2022 on MiCc  Cing green for my team
On MiCc banging on my Cday
Is there a version of this song without the repetitive choir singing in the back for a whole 5 minutes?
Legends together 😍

Can we just admit that when drake wants to murder a verse he just does it
Rapping is way too easy for Nicki right now
drake killed it, prolly more than both wayne and minaj  but i wish he went more deeper thou.
This took me back to 2010 like a fucking time machine
Niki goes like too hard...and turns up on her verse... killed it with..NO ONE BITCH COULD BE MY OPP.. THAT SHIT OFFENDS ME.CORPRATE GIANTS AND MACHINES THAT WENT AGAINST ME...her ROMAN shit trash..lol

Here from TikTok just from hearing Wayne verse
Timeless music 💯
This song is almost like them telling us “we made it, we did it” it’s almost like a homegoing song . You can just feel the emotion, it’s nostalgic, it’s them telling us they’re still here but not for long, cus once we gone we gone for good.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wonder if DMX was here how he’d take to this song
I only come for nicki part and it’s crazy Bc drake and Lil Wayne are my favorite rappers . The female 🐐! Her verse is legendary 🔥🔥🔥
💚💚💚💚
Wayne murdered but seeing all them together is something I’ll cherrish forever
P
Not gonna lie, when Tr!zzy made this beat, I had hopes to hear someone put something deep and meaningful on it, but I guess this is alright too...

#ANITTA
I’m gonna leave this comment here because I want people to know how serious Drugs are. My Mom passed away yesterday from a Overdose She was 37 and was supposed to start a new job the next day. I’m pretty sure This was Her favorite song and I decided to write a nice message on it to honor Her. I Hope whoever is reading this will very much understand the consequences. Even if you touch Drugs one time or hangout with the bad choice of people your life will be screwed up for a long period of time. It’s so terrible that this type of stuff is even a thing. I hope you’re watching over me Mom and understanding how much I miss You will all of My Heart. I will never forget all the great memories We had in the Pool like listening to Music and playing with the Animals and making funny faces all the time and trust me a lot more. They will live on forever in my Heart and so will You I Promise. You're the Most Perfect Person I could ever Imagine. All the arguments and nasty words that were said are deeply down in my regrets and I’m deeply sorry for what happened to You but for now I will let You Rest and I hope you’re in Heaven playing with our beloved Animals and much more. I hope God is taking care of You in Heaven. I wish the absolute best for Your Soul and I will forever and ever be keeping You in my Heart for all eternity. May You Rest In Paradise Mom. I Love You Mom, God Rest Your Soul. Amen. ❤️‍🩹🕊
This is one of my favorite Nicki+Wayne collab. They made so much good music together 😭 YMCM
Nwt
I'm here to say this is better than God did.
I just realized this was sampled from Heather Headley, another Trini artist. That just makes this track even better. The GOATS killed this. #timeless #QueenNicki🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄

NICKI FOREVER IS THE QUEEN
Iman ❤ nicci
Queen
Its Iman from Camden nj need to talk nic Walahi from higher love and didn't get paid need u boo
I love all their talents show in different ways... Nicki said in an interview, when Drake offered her to get on this song, at first her verses weren't good... but look at the final cut of what hard work does. It's not about how many times you fail... as long as you don't stop you'll succeed
This heat tho
We need another YMCMB album
"y'all"
I’m heavily messing with this..
Bop bop bop bop bop he was a good cat, my bad dog.
💚
This beat is something else

Nicki Minaj 😍
Wayne going through shit.
Best trio ever

This Song Is Everything!! Remind me of 2012
"im already known as the goat!" ... Ok Drake, relax....Weezy F is the 🐐no cap.

🤑🤑🤑
Inspiring tune .... always and forever!
Nicki’s verse 😮‍💨🔥🔥🔥
⁰
Yah, you’re so gansta calling a mag a “clip” obvi don’t know much about guns. This just irritates me whether it’s in a movie, show, lyric, or a person just acting like they know something - get the basics right.
2:14 Nicki verse
That was dope.
That Heather Headley sample 🔥🔥
They all sound like they bringing it back, nice
Ot The Real put this beat 6 by 6 by 6 under
This song straight fire. Reminds me of the good ol days in high school listening to nothing but young money
My favorite 3
Im just here to find the verse nicki dissed megan . 👀👀👀
Wayne is such a catalyst lol sheesh
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
This songs replay value is eternal!
Has that Jay-Z Dynasty Roc La Familia Intro feel.  I get Goosebumps . It's a f****** movie on audio.
I’m here to listen bc Nikki’s ex Assistant said some bout a meg diss 👀
THIS IS A SNAP SESSION
in her perception, she ain't no bitch but m.a prolly the only that can deny it.
Have listen to this song since it dropped but can't still understand wat drake was saying in my opinion his verse was low key trash... then he inspired Nicki Minaj to write her verse but forgot to do the same to his ghost writer 😁🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
Nicki looks great in that picture that comes up
One of the best Nicki Minaj songs
so the diss is about megan?
So this the song she dissed Meg in? 👀
This is the 2nd time I'm hearing this and it's just not it lol idk man I try but this just fades to the back.
I'm here cause of that assistant
exposed queen
So this the song she dogged Megan in talking about "these bitches thirsty I can see why they're alcoholics" Wow😳😳😳
This the song she sneak dissed megg?👀
So I’m here cuz supposedly there’s a diss for Megan the stallion on here
Am I the only one that skip to nicki part because of what her ex assistant wrote and said she was dissing megan 😂
💜💜💜
I just finished listening to In My Mind by Heather Headley (magnificent song) and it clicked. The beginning intro of this song is a sample of her ending. LOVE IT!!!!!🥴🥺🤩🤩💋
I’m here after the assistant
im here to listen to the lyrics after her assistant spilled all the tea.
Nicki minaj house is on the sex offenders list online because of her husband kenny
Who’s here because Nikki’s nda exposing her
Here because of the tea that’s going on. #2022
she really dissed meg with that alcohol line...the assistant isnt lying
Confirmed by nickis ex assistant, nicki is dissing Megan in this song.
Let's admit it we miss this trio
Damn after her homie spilled the tea you can see the Megan diss 😂😂😂😂
Who else is here after seeing that Kate Miller tea? 👀
So this the song she dissed Megan on ? 😆
my vecna song
24 mill Rip Kobe
Now this legend now imagine if yb kodak n chief keef all did a song together
Leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and spirit 😳 first time I heard this song i vibed with it
This song is the shit not gonna hold anyone, but dude Heemi Black Jay From My City PGH, did this beat 3-4 years its called "Dear Diary 2"
I mean yeah niki was good but young weezy was goated
The lyrics video🎶❤️👇🏻🎧 https://youtu.be/Oaqfkj-YaGQ
Niki minaj is a bad chicka,  and can rap and sing
They should’ve put Meek on this
Wayne sounds like chance in this ig chance took some inspiration from Wayne
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤦🏾‍♂️
I love how this trio is so iconic and anytime they meet it up it's a genuine classic.
Wayne went stupid
Sht so trash. This remind me why ghost writers are so vital in the music industry and where most artists would be without them, Wayne excluded.
This record couldv went quadruple platinum back in 08 or 2010, so sad mumble shit is more listened to than real rap 😏
The fact she had a hard time writing her verse 🤯
Lord have mercy 🥺
Ghost writing nicki again 🤦‍♂️
Wayne still on fire 🔥
Wayne had the best verse hands down....no debate
A masterpiece

Hai
Rah how have I only heard this 😅

Holy shit! Just hearing this for the first time. Damn this feels like some just blaze type beat. The word play. The lyrics and verses overall, this is simply sick man. What a classic song. Pay this forward.
That Steven king bar is slept on fuckin genius
Damn I miss this Drake!
Wayne is the 🐐 no competition at all 🔥
Drakes Putin line aged well…
Nice to see Wayne go first On A feature track for once... on this heat we play the whole track 🔥🔥

Wayne lost his top on this one, sound like old Wayne
This the best song ever fr🔥🔥🔥
The instrumental just make me wanna cry🥺🔥
Old Nicki and Drake makes me so emotional… 😭❤️
Am I the only one who just realized the beat samples Heather Headley “In My Mind”😅🔥
You just had to grow up during the YMCMB era to see why this song is goated. 3 legends.. 10 years later.. STILL legendary.
Drake verse wasn't necessary ,off beat like he didn't even want to be on  the track
Headley on the track yeh yeh yeh !😉🔥🔥🔥🔥
song do be bussin tho
!
I’m partial to Drizzy, I love his continued support of Queen Onika. Lyrical Assault team.
Hearing that lighter click makes me hype before the Wayne verse.
One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent....  she almost, almost...almoooooost....got weezy on this 1 but fiiiire.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤟🏻🌈✨😇🥰

Nicki week 🔥🔥

Ima keep it real this WHOLE song is Hella hard
👀💚
Lil wayne owned it🔥
Wayne showed his ass
Do a song with Charlie Puth
Shesssh bars on top of bars 24/7 open bars
Drake. Is. Just... my God
I AM THE STAR IN ANY ROOM I STAND IN, I AM THE STAND OUT
Nope! Only Young MA killed it on this beat with heartfelt lyrics.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxQa8xNheLQ&ab_channel=YoungMA
The few years at that point  where these three were running the game was a special time and this brings that feeling back.  It was the era right before the SoundCloud rappers really kicked in the doors of hip hop. The last era where most rappers were truly just rapping. 2008-2013 was a great era forsure. Legendary shit
Drake inadvertently made an Oliver tree reference 😂
Keep this in rotation...
Dopest song💯

I wish they'd make a music video for this song
Even as a male I can relate to this: "No one b*tch could be my opp, that shit offends me, It's corporate giants and machines that went against me." -That shit is bananas.
This beat is insane!!!
YMCMB the hardest rap collective the whole clique went in 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Checkmate Mr Lee you said I should have went to Roosevelt
Drake's "Putin" line was epic when this first came out, but I have to admit it hasn't aged very well, given the Ukraine situation . . . 😐
Love driving around smoking a big fat ass blunt bumping this..... this beat though.. damn and nicki went the fuck off...yassss queen
I don’t think y’all understand how these three dominated the rap game
Song is so good without nicki
That yeah sounds like it comes from Heather Headley’s in my mind
Best song of 2021 hands down
Nicki and Wayne now have over 2 BILLION streams as a duo together on Spotify!!! 🦄👑🐐👑

👏🏻👏🏻❤👍🙏🏼
My highway song 🎶 on the highway headed to work, so nostalgic 😮‍💨

Nicki the star of any beat she hops on hands down!
في #فرق كبير بين برشامه اللي غنا ف الاول ده 🤨#ومابين نيكي عاااش👍❣️
Facts
don't forget, "Arena" is "Sand" in Spanish, so basically it's metaphorically comparing sand to haters  Life is a beach house, don't let the SAND in I ball in any arena, go let the FANS in  Which is why the new jersey bar came after since you wear those in basketball arena's
😍😍
Nikki str8 KILLED this sun 🌞🌞🌞...NO CAP!!!

This song feels straight out of 2012 in a good way
The thing about this song is they sound like they did in 2009..non of that new age auto tune/mumble sound
THE QUEEN OF RAP, ladies and gentlemans!!!🥵🥵🥵
Intro to this song reminds of the intro to Blue Laces 2 by Nipsey Hussle.
Soy la estrella principal y tú mi asistente
I wish Spotify had this without nickis part🔥🔥 Wayne and drake ate
“Face who?, I could see a wall of y’all and run straight through “Trust it’s all fun and games until I wanna play too”- One of drakes hardest lines ever imo
Nice 👍▶️⏯️▶️

Wayne😫
woulda been complete if drake had a chorus thats all im sayin
nicki's version is straight to Cardi and Magh. I don't have enough. 2021 and yet it seems to be a new song
I think Wayne bodied drake and nicki Minaj all by his self Wayne is one of my favorite rapper all times hands down
My fav song

Why is nobody talkin bout Drake verse?? Best verse onnat jawn
Please can we get an official music video of Seeing Green
This beat 🔥🔥
You will forever be remembered in the history of this world👑😭😭❤️💯
🥺💕💕
The fact this song is being slept on still is a big shame. This is a classic .. I use to listen to these 3 when I was in high school a decade ago which now i think about it is crazy. Being 28 now, I can appreciate this work. Long live the big 3, Wayne, Drake and Nicki.
Young money❤️❤️
Nicki spat fire. So many hot bars. Like her old self. One year later and I’m back again. “These bitches still my sons, who can ever deny it? My packs hit different, who can ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me. It’s corporate giants and machines that went against me. I wash bitches, they couldn’t even rinse me. She said she hot, I said, “Well, bitch, come and convince me! Ain’t no C in green, but I’m seein’ green!” THIS IS PURE TALENT IN ITS RAWEST FORM.  Nah, she ate on this too much!!!😭
A hip hop masterpiece
Dope track by Nicky lil wayne verse and nicky and drake are hot 🔥🥵🙌👌💯😍 💘
💎🙌🌙
Man Wayne and Nicki kilt this sht 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ms this Wayne 🔥
if this album had good cover art it definitely would’ve been perceived better
Nicki's verse!!! 🗣🔥💖
Drake captured the beat,Wayne killed the beat and Nicki buried the beat
Dawg Wayne dropped the shit out of both of them respectfully I like seeing them together I have huge appreciation but holy fuck this man's verse was totally different he literally snapped
Remember back when any song that Drake and Wayne were featured on together that day became a national holiday.. it was a bigger day than Christmas!!
3 mean niggas barrzz will never be touch
NUH, THIS SONG HITS DIFFERENT EVERY LISTEN, A YEAR LATER
The intro sounds like sunday church
🐐🐐🐐
3:28 .
Help me
Wayne verse on this & “You only live twice” are fuckin insane! 🐐
Nickis part gets me soo emotional 💕😮‍💨🔥 I feel it deep in my soul !!!!! God is soo good
"Yous a good cat, my bad dog."
🤯💣💣💥💥🔂
😱😱😱😱😱
One of the best collabo in 2021. This song hasn’t gotten the credit it deserves.
This was the best collab of 2021
“Trying to run the country like Puttin one day but who’s Russhin?🙊
I never knew Onika could buss like this??? Who knew???
BARSSSS.
Drake wants to invade Ukraine
She said she was gonna have a baby and slow down. She still hungry. Still tryna remain at the top and doesn't wanna be comparable. No rapper should be compared anyway. No fan here. Just acknowledging what I notice. Part of the rap business is getting it to a point where it's known as more a way to brand oneself. Entertainment industry is more work than play. Just to smile on screen. These artists know how small the business is and want their brand to be BIGGER. Not just some one hit wonder or a seasonal rapper. Movies, soundtracks, talk shows, clothing lines, etc. Why not the name your brand is be on EVERYTHING. Give the chick another 10+ she gonna rap about us drinking her water! 🐱
Weezy’s verse went the hardest 🔥  Just smooth with it and the flow is constant. Non-corny with his own personal flare and unique voice. Weezy is the golden child of our generation and we don’t realize how lucky we are to exist at the same time
could've left Niki out, she was not needed at all 😒
they are actually INSANE for this😩😩🔥🔥
Gucci who?? 😂
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻🐲👌🏻❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
“Ima pull up so lit I might crash dwg”😭
Love this song 🥺❤️
I wished Drake kept rapping like this
Wayne is really the 🐐
I AM THE STAND OUT, U JUST MY STAND IN 💅🦄 - NICKI
Why is there no video for this it’s ridiculous  This is why real rap music be falling off because it don’t be a video for it  Niggas gotta change that shit
Please all
Give classic Young money vibes
My fav song 🔥🔥🔥❤️
2pac sent this beat from heaven
Wayne went to hard to be followed up no 🧢 this shyt was hard
Hollup hollup .....Drake really said "see more plaques than toothbrushes"
Wayne the 🐐of 🐐’s
Take me back here!!!
This song makes me so emotional. Just to witness how she has been treated, but still standing tall. She’s so talented and protected from the most high(GOD). The happiest I’ve seen her in a long time. She married now and has a precious bundle of joy (Papa Bear).
This is gives me nostliga or whatever its called🎵🎶
I'm me
Over 475 000 likes....not 1 dislike. That's what you get when Thee Hottest Threesome get together for The Culture Connection. The Cake, The Goat and The Queen.... doing The Most. YESSIR!!!!

"tryna run a country like Putin one day but who's rushin" that bar hit different now
Trizzy went ham on this beat!!!
I miss Young Money. Been a fan since 2010. Its been 12 years, still dominating the industry. I had no idea Drake would go on to be so big and while everyone jumped on the bandwagon with Take Care, Nicki has always been my number 1.
This song deserved a music video
Still slaps, especially in the car.
Shit is 🔥🔥. But I wish Nikki hit it different. Too slow. Should have hit it like Wayne on the same level.
nicki murdered!!

Putin being how he is now makes Drake’s bar about him that much more crazy lol
CHEEAAAAHHHH BOiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All of  them spit 🔥
Nicki part was the BEST!!!!

I cannot believe it took me so long figure out the beat is actually Heather Headley’s voice. In My Mind is one of my favorite songs from her so I was shocked

Nicki will forever be the queen. All these other ladies in the game are doing an outstanding job but when the queen decides to come back, the whole world gets put on notice. 🔥
Lil Wayne is versatile

Listening this after a while and realise drake killed this shit !
‘Tryna run the country like PUTIN one day but who’s rushin?’   That line hit different after Feb 24 2022…
Just watched the interview with Joe. To think she struggled with this is crazy. She killed it
Meek Mill was suppose to get ahold of this beat first if you know, you know..
I always have to listen to Nicki verse twice before the song ends

Diddy’s And ever since the pandemic They don’t wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin’, “Free Drizzy” I know bae trust my vision but don’t want me to see prison Said, “I can’t make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit” Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I’m the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put ya six feet deep, I’m bein’ socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain’t talkin’ videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch, Tunechi [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that’s what they hand in That’s why I’m private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don’t let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that’s word to Camden These bitches’ time tick-tockin’, better stick to dancin’ I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Poppa Bear can frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain’t gotta ever talk about when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin’ He call me solid even though I’m drippin’ water diet Big booty stickin’ out, my Daisy Dukes’ll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It’s corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn’t even rinse me She said she hot, I said, “Well, bitch, come and convince me” Ain’t no C in green, but I’m seein’ green Even with them floor seats, they couldn’t see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send ’em back or flee the scene [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin’ money is you can be dramatic Y’all some drama queens, for real It’s all good, though, you now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y’all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj and y’all still dyin’, man, wassup? We in this bitch [Verse 3: Drake] This ain’t gon’ be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I’m at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin’, do somethin’ All meetings happen in person, so they can’t prove nothin’ Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who’s rushin’, who’s bluffin’? For real Who you huggin’, who you wanna be lovin’? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who’s subbin’? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can’t trouble me from Doubletree Step your suites up, I get to Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin’ like a slice of pizza That’s when I had to hit her with the, “Nice to meet ya” You niggas think you doin’ damage, you just hypin’ me up Face who? I could see a wall of y’all, all of y’all and run straight through Trust, it’s all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it’s bringin’ me closer to God I’m already close to the mob, I’m already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close but you won’t, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit’s a facade None of this shit’s a mirage Thought I was seein’ great things when I was seein’ green 6 God, CMB, yessir
That Putin line didn’t age well
Wayne’s muffled transition going into the verse was filthy.
This song is so Spiritual. All the best rappers are  Spiritual. The beat sounds like angels singing down from heaven.
Drake dropped a classic verse in this if you ask me
Beat sound is from heather headley In my mind
My fav verse by Weezy in the last 5 years fr 🔥🔥
Woo Ballin so hard wassup with them cruixs
Such a good fucking song my god
Drake said I wanna be president like putan nah drake puck that shit 100💯,nvm drake has done alot for a lot of.different people may the lord help him wirh any sadness he experienced 🙏
Drake such a liar he did not play 48 minutes with a torn meniscus that shit fire 🔥 tho
🐐🐐🐐
“Some see graffiti as art, some can see hoes to be women” 🔥
ENCORE ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
LET ME TAKE THIS BALENCIAGA  MASK OFF TO ASK YALL… WHO ASKED YALL 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trynna run the country like who?💀
Wayne is so crazy 😧
Drakes Russian line didn't age well. Fire tho king 🤴
wayne still tha best
Someone please tell me what's the song they rapping over it's a old one
Most unrelated song of our time. This song is literally gonna go down in history as one of the greatest rap collaborations in Hip Hop! Big ups to Wayne, Nicki & Drake !!!
Man that Drake line about Vladimir Putin really didn't age well lol
When the last time I felt like Wayne dominated a track? Has to be like 2010. This song is legendary
running the world like putin
Grek clean Cleveland compass crazy flying famine mop sweep twt exercise choreography cardio workout tornado warning oonn
🎀🎀🎀
they really channeled 2012 on this one i feel like i’m 13 again
This a 3headed dragon literally😭😭
Ima comment on this everytime and idgaf who get mad🤣🤣💯
Y’all remember the dude with the beat pad in his car that made this beat?? So happy it blew up.
Auo i m the star in any room that ı stand in♥️
Life is a beach house  Don’t let the sand in ....💀💀💀🔥🤟🏽
Nikki might have the best verse its very close.....straight fire flames... no cap but I'm on those capsules
Tryna run the country like Putin, but who’s Russian 😳   ..Did Drake predict Ukraines invasion?    Thought I was seeing things, when I was seeing green. 6 God, CMB
“AYO” - 🥶😈
drake go tell Putin to chill out Gangy
drake: tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin' yeah that didn't age well
Why the motherfucking cinderella's ass is this so UNDERRATED???????????????
Drake was speaking facts....
This was 9 months ago already ??
Drizzy was spittin
People don’t realize what 2011 was like
Nicki minaj is just insane her bars are mad...I'm the star in every room I stand in I'm the stand except for when u my just my stand on
“Trying to run the country one day like Putin but who’s Russian?” Who else here during WW3?
Wayne went ballistic       Nikki brought artillery Drake dropped the atom bomb 💥 Just to make sure that you know they still here.
Personally I'm 90s rap,First time I have heard these 3 together and ❤️ IT 💯, I see what you mean, and I'm seeing Green

Drake went off the hardest 😮‍💨😮‍💨🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
nicki's verse is so fire my god
“I wash bitch3s man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" her verse was for all the female rappers that she ain’t goin nowhere and she will forever be queen top, this line for Megan Thee Stallion cuz of always saying “real hot girl ish” hot hot
Please we need a video😭😭
Wayne is so good and so talented people don't even know what they're listening to... goes right over ever1 head an then want to tell me hes garbage lol lol lol
When Wayne kills a feature hilariously to a point where Nicki reminds us that this is her song and Drake decides of pulling out that "Artist of the decade" card to remind us that he is Drake.
Massive sounds 🙌❤️ Kindly check out this 8 track EP Right here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTLm4cAz6r5IEVGn3M7W8EmD6KTVNThav

Still get goosebumps listening to this! How this didn’t blow up is beyond me.
The number of crazy bars and double entendres that Drake put in his verse is mind blowing
~32 bars for Wayne @76.5 bpm. Did he drop in early on his verse? It was hard to tell.
DONT PIUT PUT MNO BA BOY BAD CALL BADOONGK ADONK GUCIIII DAAYAAAM

Most underrated song on planet earth
Ok so yes everyone google it this album was released in 2009 it is now the first time being released on as a digital album on all the streaming platforms 😅 thought I was going through a Mandela effect for a second 😆🤣
It's Drakes song 🎵  now 🔥 🔥
nicki
Nicki 👑
Still listening in 2022 🔥 we need more music like this …
How did my phone know exactly what song I was looking for in my mind ? 🤯
This song is soo underrated!! This is real rap!
This the 💎 in the entire mixtape sounds good enough to be deopped in a album
It needs to be understood that NIcki Minaj is the best female rapper based on the fact she has to have bars that can keep up with Lil Wayne's.
Everyone went in!!!
Dont know if this song did good or bad but i dont care. Great to hear all of them again 🔥 wish my girl was still here to hear them together again! Awesome song. They all spit straight 🐉🔥
Hello 👋 baby good Live

Man sure pressure make diamonds but diamonds tend to go missing
Well I don't b wanting nobody else happiness so I barely look at anyone & I b making folk crazy kind of so I just b tryna mind my business but things happen
Baby only person can shut dondre up he so mf aggravating
Well maamaa savage on my body about her body & face look coming out the way she is too but actually out of my vagins too bc we all kno summer got one father but savage the one baby for me & she want some brown & black eyes like that new durk baby
Baby make me want to keep my gap
When I found Jackboy I got thirsty cus piccolo wanna have his kids but he can't necessarily w. Out sumn magical happening he like 30
Aiming to be the real number three & playa of the year

💖💖💖
for nicki's part it is @2:14
They will appreciate this track after 5 years trust me
Been a Nikki fan, my opinion but perhaps her best verse.  Wayne does what expected from a giant,  but  I think drake could have brought it a little harder!
“DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM⁉️” Nicki Minaj X Lil Baby out Feb 4th in all platforms!!!
Na that drake bar was crazy “tryna run a country like putin one day but who’s rushing (Russian) 🤦‍♂️
My Queen 👑 and her barz
Onikaa 😩😩😩

Had to come here after that megan collab they just dropped 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yeah yeah yeah
Lil wayne made drizzy and Nicki!!
“Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the minaj is silent” 😈💀💀
I absolutely hate that we don't get this more often. We've gotten great music specially 2021, but the rapping in this song is absolutely high level... This beat only requires high level rap and it went to the two of the best Male rappers ever and imo the best female rapper by far with no discussion.   If i don't listen to this song at least twice a week, i feel weird now.   You can't listen to this and do anything mediocre because every inch of this song is big energy.
Wayne the GOAT, dead or alive there won't ever be another one like him 💯🐐
Thankyou nicki I love you 😘
Wayne and Nicki's verse>>>>>>
Soon as I heard Nikki say AYO on this track I got the chills.  None of the other female rappers that are poplar right now can touch this verse or Nikki.  As many others have said, this song is unbelievably underrated!
Just seeing this message. ❤
Did Nicki fell off?
Wayne just destroyed this
Free DRIZZY!!!
🤑🤑🤑🤑❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Young MA  Nicki had to go and get Drake and Wayne after you killed this beat.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This sample Is 🔥🔥🔥💯🤦🏽‍♂️
"...he was a good cat! My bad, dog.."
I don't know why  it it makes me emotional when Nicki said these bitches still my son😩
The best ever. Ymcmb for life.
Cinderella lost her glass shoe at 12....   I just felt like that bar should go over nobody's head.
Cash Money Movie Night
Nicki's verse makes me so emotional 😭 she went through so much and she still got her happy ending AND the best career! When she said she's God's child, she wasn't lying 🥺❤

Did they change the lyrics up a little for this rereleased banger?!   I miss those days when all 3 of these got together because you could tell they all vibed and enjoyed each other. I know they still do but it was magic when they all first got together.
Ba! Ba! Ba! Ba! Ba! ALL 2022 💥

It is 1:14am on January 3rd of 2022 & now that a new year has started and we are completely out of 2021 i can now officially say that SEEING GREEN by nicki minaj featuring lil wayne & drizzy drake,  that was featured on the rerelease of Nickis "Beam Me Up Scotty" 2009 mixtape was WITHOUT A DROP OF DOUBT,  100% the best rap song and/or collaboration of 2021! Also nicki minaj had the best rap verse by a female rapper in 2021! 🦄🦄🦄 #BigDot
Coming from someone who couldn't stand YM back in the beginning, this is fire.  I appreciate Nicki making a new song with the boyz after all these years and everyone sounds mint.
Nick sent shots 🔥🔥🔥 send them back or flee the scene 😍😻😍🔥🔥🔥
Perfection
🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Okay why am I just hearing this song. Nicki snapped and I'm not even a Nicki fan. But I'm not blind the bs

Nicki killed rest of the rapper in this industry
nice video
Only the Mother Queen can rap with the likes of Jay-Z, Kanye, Eminem, Lil Wayne and Drake.
When Wayne starts his verse he sounds muffled then says “ let me take this Balenciaga mask off and ask y’all who asked y’all.” In a clear tone. And I - that’s genius. They all individually killed it 🙌🏽
Song 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 listen to everyday Nicki part crazy

Nicki bodies everyone on this track
3v1
Sample from the song In My Mind
Why am I having a hard time remembering where that beat original come from
Damn that 808 bumping! Who responsible for this  sound
Lil Wayne murdered all. But this track is bumping.
leave nicki alone!!!!! respeck to tune and drizzy.
CETTE CHANSON EST DANS LA PLAYLIST DE BIA  " WHOLE LOTTA MONEY" NOUS SOMMES YOUNG MONEY NOUS SOMMES FLEUR DE LYS
Man I still play this everyday, they owe us a video for this one. Wayne does what no one else does on these beats bro!
Wayne kilt this Bihh...137004🤟🤟💯🔥
They need a sound engineer. The problem is the voice is was above the instrumental. Like way. Like someone just sent them the instrumental and they did it in one take. I hope meek mill jumps on this beat in his own time
This shit deserved a Grammy, and they know damn well, but fuck grammys.
Hotter than wasabi ☆
Nicki Minaj the Queen of rap 🛐
Wayne nicki and drake did a good job on this but can we please big up the man who made this lol shit is nasty af. This his original video https://youtu.be/4TvmXAR709c enjoy
Every single 🐐 in this deserved a Grammy for their individual verse 💥
Damn Lil Wayne Kurosaki why you gotta hit us with a bankai like that :***( !
More music like this
Me know when I should be in a meeting with reset but it is a bit of benetton tops
My ears wide open..
This should’ve been Grammy nominated but I don’t think she submitted it. Seeing Green was best best rap song this year, ugh!
N Yo...bop bop bop,he was a good cat my bad dawg ?rheeeeeeeeee fuckkkkkkkk Wayne be that boyy6
Nicki should've went harder than that
Horse said she hot I said well b come and convince me!
Hip Hop song of the year 🙏
obstruction of justice. record companies are mis informed. who likes rap music? If you hear anyone in the rap community saying my name. contact me. it’s a conspiracy. Americans can know the truth. it’s a phone. pick it up.
Best hip hop song of 2021 REAL RAP
Ayo I am the star in any room that i stand in
This beat throws me back to the first few The Carter albums.
This song deserves a Grammy 🏆 😍😍 🔥 🔥🔥🔥
Bomb shit!!!!
Yo what's good this shit needs be on the billboard the fuck

Best Drake verse of the entire year. the whole song is fire too
ntro: Lil Wayne & Heather Headley] Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah) Bae gave it to me (Hmm) You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B-Boy, "Bad kall," that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe The cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear can frolic One Margherita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me "Nicki, cock the blicky," the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, what's up? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir
I love her
Nicki queen of rap 👑

Lil Wayne’s verse  🔥🔥..🐐
Lil Wayne killed this, Nicki also had fire analogies in her verse drake could had went harder but he still had a dope verse though
nicki micki こんちは、  nicki mickiの体は dynamite body だと思う。  そのnicki mickiの dynamite body oh yeah になりたい女性は 世界中にいるだろう。 20代とか、中学生とか。  しかしnicki mickiの dynamite body oh yeah thank you になることは なかなか難しいかもしれない。  それはやはり nicki mickiが dynamite body oh yeah thank you very much になることができる、 素質を持っているんだろうと 思う。  その dynamite body oh yeah thank you very much ok ができるところが、 nicki mickiらしさ なんだろうなと思う。
19 million views off of a audio 💯💯💯💯💯 nowadays everyone is releasing videos with tiktok dances but the queen took it back to the old school never mess with my queen she will body you lyrically and still get hella views without a official visual and those little challenges 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄👑 👑 👑

Re Nicki being attacked for speaking her mind.  Jimmy Dore did a conversation with a doctor who INVENTED mRNA vaccines and it was brilliant. She should hear this conversation, Everyone in the U.S. should hear this conversation.  Other poorer countries are having better health outcomes than the U.S.  Link: https://youtu.be/iwPKnOhJRYg
What's Pfizer stock worth now?
Is how she said the goat plus her, I hope people know who’s the goat she speak of smh.
"It's corporate giants and machines that went against me" - Truer now than when the song dropped.
Single Mothers raising Sons will emulate their Mom with their butt sticking out 🙄 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLWYsWr4LWw&t=20s
She made this song for me
Horrible sample 😖
Thanks for speaking out against the v@x. Based queen. God bless you.
I support your statements about the v@x much respect for standing up against the mainstream recently

Holy sh*t. I didn't know you were actually that dumb :(
Much respect!!  You are about to feel the wrath of the propaganda machine that conservative voices have felt for a decade.  Strong strong and find truth!
🤩
I just came to support nicki for her standing up to the machine, but this new shit is classic

“tryna run a country like Putin one day but who’s rushing?” (russian) he’s too tuff
Wtf that Lil Wayne verse no joke was one of the best verses I've ever heard
Nicki Menaj won't go to the Met Gala fundraising event because they're requiring guests to be vaxxed.  This no talent claims the vaccines cause impotence.  Sounds to me like her BRAIN is impotent.
My cousin calls Nicki MS Barbie only they don't call her Nicki
Anyone else only have the clean version on spotify? Or is that just an Australian thing?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💣💣💣💣💣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
my brother is obsessed with this song bababababap
Toop clipe tmj

How did I sleep on this? Banger!
So waiting for you on the remix of Have Mercy with Chloe
Anyone else remember the days when Wayne legit murdered everyone over their own beat? People knew he was gonna kill them on their own song and still paid him $$$ for the verse bc they knew he was about to make them more famous than they could ever be alone. S/O to a fr GOAT.
This is song of the year because of what it means to the game - to have the creators of the game back together is priceless - not to mention the bars from each one this feel like old young money we need a cd
If you don’t mention Seeing Green that will tell Nicki everything she needs to know.
WHO IS HERE AFTER NICKI'S TWEET ?
listening this song everyday!
Listening all the time when im off to work....more fire ✌🏾  All the way 🇿🇦
This shyt solid💯💯💯 Coulda came out  playin with Juice Crew BDP, EPMD, all the way till now niggas should be happy they don't do it but so often. Fuk wat u heard this is the Super Group. Another 1ne without khalid😂🤣😂💯✌🏿🏄🏿

Drakes the king, Wayne's the goat, Nicki's obviously the queen the way she puts that in there is sick
Bruh why am I just hearing this didn’t blow up on the socials
did anyone not hear nicki revealed papabears reak name at the end of her verse at 2:48 its very hard to hear i had to play it in slow-mo
The flop😭
Got the amazing background music from Heather Headley’s song “In my mind”.. classic song !
So Wayne done being a garbage trend follower? He sound like himself here
Don’t put no k after that b boy  Bad call  That’s flag talk 🔥
if drake kept this song and put it on CLB it would have been better than donda
Love the music and the lyrics.
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Woe
Nicki Minaj still the best female Lyricist hands down
Life is a beach house don’t let the sand in

NICKI MINAJ IS THE QUEEN OF RAP
IS IT 2010 AGAIN??? WTF THIS IS TOO FIRE!!! I been waiting for YM and these 3 to drop shit like this again for idk how long!!@
Crown them both please
I really really really love this   Jah Jah know
Nicki's lazy she didn't actually work hard for her sucess she part of the illuminati that's why she was signed and already famous when she started releasing music and yes it was bc lil wayne signed her but what the illuminati basically does is they put curses on the artist so at every concert you go to they play the artist like puppets. Even the CEO of the illuminati said he would watch men turn into gangsters and beautiful women turn into sluts and whores and he regrets it so think again I mean you could stay a nicki fan but I'm just sayin.
the "yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea" makes it so good
Just discovered your channel and by far, it is the most complete "study with me" available on youtube. I'm in my last semester of grad school, and totally burnt out. This has made such a difference in the day since I became a subscriber. Thank you!
Yall like song

This so trash
this has got to be one of the best recent lil wayne verses no 🧢
nicki go to hard
this deserve 10000BILLION views watch this everyday!😠😠
2:48
The beat alone is a masterpiece
No disrespect to Nicki or Drake of course. But after Lil Wayne’s verse it’s really not much reason to listen to the rest of the song. That’s the chance you take putting Lil Wayne on a song with you because his verse is probably gonna steal the show and make your verse virtually irrelevant lol.
Nicki your songs get into me so deep ..thank you Queen

Thanks to the engineer for mixing Wayne’s vocals so nicely in this track 💯
What I don't understand is that I'm trying to do better for my life and yet I got people always intervening with itI'll give up everything to do with the streets but at the same time I want that respect back to me because I don't go spying on other people's lifeif I really could get the real solid woman in my life that I deserve them please Lord send that one to me to get me off the streets cuz this is not funny or nothing that I want to be behindon my bills on my responsibilities I'm tired of people telling me go get a job because yet I know what I have and what I mine but yet you know what they want to be stingy and not do that help me then f*** it I don't need it because honest to God I'll move on without it and still build on my own again

‘My money tall and brallic’  The only artist in the history of music to ever rhyme that word, I felt that…
Nicki baby come harder. You rapping with Legends. While other women is trying to take your crown. You can't leave room for nobody. Wayne and Drake was legendary as usual. Queen come harder.
Nostalgia at it's finest
We're witnessing 3 great artists. Let's not take this for granted.

El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a façade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB Yes sir

#seeinggreen #Queen #lilwayne #drake
Nicki is incredible. Like mad talented
The Wayne start 🔥
And people still call these rappers trash like how? This is so good
This makes me feel like I’m back in middle school, rapping to drake, Nicki, or Lil Wayne with my friends during gym class.    I’m 23 years old and married now. So much has changed. Things were so much simpler as a kid, when your biggest problem was math class. Now we’re dealing with over a years worth of a pandemic & a tyrannical government.           Music, movies, TV shows, and books have been my only escape throughout 2020 & 2021. Thank you Drake, Nicki & Lil Wayne for helping us forget about this crazy world, even if it’s only for a little bit.
Drake: You know, one of the perils of makin' money  Is you can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj And y'all still dyin, ' man, wassup? We in this bitch This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin' Who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin'? Who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a façade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green”   The story is unreal.
They all went off but Nicki snapped!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

They deleted it so when it went public they had a movie role. To expose all the proof of them on camera. Stealing money. Embezzlement. Minstrel Show.

For entertainment to pass around on the dark web. Going public on the dark web not in society. They wanted to pass around my video going public on the dark web red rooms as entertainment to laugh at the things they watched me do through medical malpractice. Pain and suffering. They were acting and pretending they didn't hear me on the cbs video but played the sex audio at low frequency. Then I said on tapethat I Already proved it in a fall tape that they knew about the medical malpractice. Then I went directly to the BLACKOUT DAY VIDEO on CNN. I recorded me watching the clip and doing the breakdown that I saw. Then I did a film study of the CNN blackout day to go public about racism medical malpractice and lgbt discrimination. I was on point i was shooting aimlessly like you guys reaching for reasons. I said I had a clip and that clip was accurate about my whole project. Proved my tape from June 1st was legit. And the murder link on Facebook sent to me! Cnn BLACKOUT DAY proved there was audio playing in the background like CBS did that day I watched the video and I was by the television when they decided to play it cause they knew I was close to the TV they could see and hear themselves! That was when I warned them on CBS i had a video to prove what they were doing. Same day directly after i was on video searching for the blackout day video to prove it was happening and they were trying to make me look crazy and they got exposed for invasion of privacy. How?

Drake really took us back to his old flowing ways...

I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison💯
This song is lit😋
Nicki Breakdown: I broke down Nicki's verse and bars you may've missed while listening. I divided each line and bar description so that it will make it easier to find which line you want to know more about!   "I am the star in any room that stand in I am the stand out you just my stand-in" - The second "stand in" is referring to someone being a space filler for Nicki until she makes her return.   "These bitches copy my homework that's what they hand in" - This line could mean more than one thing. In school, if you didn't do your homework, you'd copy from another person's work and "hand in" your work to the teacher. Nicki is referring to her "sons" saying they are copying her every move and handing it in to their labels.   "That's why I'm private like the airports I land in" - This obviously explains her privacy and being a continuation of the previous line explaining why she is as private as she is.   "Life is a beach house don't let the sand in" - The reference to the beach house could be an analogy to life. Logically, you wouldn't want to get sand in your beach house because of the mess it tracks in. This could be applied to life as Nicki is describing her life and comparing that to the paradise of a beach house. The sand could be referencing not letting any "dryness" or "negativity" in her lavish life. "I ball in any arena go let the fans in" - This can describe Nicki's flexibility as an artist and as a human being in general. That public has to see how amazing she is.   "I should go cop a New Jersey that's word to Camden" - Camden is a city in New Jersey.   "These bitches time ticktocking better stick to dancing" - People dance on the hit social media app "TikTok" and she is using wordplay with the name to refer to time how much her "sons" don't have much time left.   "I D&G the wallet my money tall and brolic" - D&G is a brand and it's safe to assume Nicki has one or more D&G wallets. She uses the next word "money" to bounce off of D&G and goes on about her wealth.   "Big ass backyards just so Papa Bear could frolic" - Frolic means to play. She's letting us know that space won't be a problem for them!   "One Margherita pizza with parmesan and garlic" - This is just classic Nicki style to reference food in her raps. It's not a Nicki song unless she tells you what she orders.   "These bitches thirsty I could see why they alcoholics" -  This is a stand out line. Not only does it reference quenching a thirst, but there's a reason she said "alcohol" and not just water or anything else of that sort. This could mean that she peeps how people are setting themselves up by being "thirsty" and not receiving what they're reaching for.  Leaving them in a constant state of seeking approval and slight depression.   "Ain't gotta ever talk about when you are about it just bought a new car not to drive it but to walk around" - Nicki was talking Big Mac sh*t on this song and her ego, confidence, and presence was all there. Perfect for the early 2000s production they went for.   "Just call me Nicki cock the blicky the menage is silent" - Nicki as in herself • Blicky as in a gun • Menage as in threesome. It's a threesome between you, her, and the gun.   "Brand new vanilla Maserati I been Häagen-Dazs" -  Häagen-Dazs is an ice cream and she's describing the the color of her car. Häagen-Dazs was a word used to describe Denmark's fair treatment to Jews while WWll was happening. I don't know if it would be a reach to say that Nicki is also saying that she has been treating herself to good things. Double entendres. Her bars are crazy. "He call me solid even though I'm dripping water diet big booty sticking out my Daisy Dukes a' cause a riot" - Solid as in she's a real person. Dripping water diet as in she's everywhere. There's no doubt that Nicki's body has been a conversation that's thawed out as years go on. She knows she has people to fantasize about her which is what she explains.   "These bitches still my sons who could ever deny it" - This is true Nicki fashion. Anybody who knows Nicki knows that she has had plenty of "sons" in the game. Like she says, nobody can deny it.   "My packs hit different who could ever supply it" - Her "packs" as in her skill. Nobody can come close to what she has to bring to the game. No matter how many people come in, their "package" won't compare to hers.   "No one bitch could be my opp that shit offends" - It's no secret that acclaimed pushes have happened in this industry. No one's artist could compare to her, even though they may try to duplicate her.   "It's corporate giants and machines that went against me" - This adds on to her previous line only as in the business aspect of it and not anyone specifically. She's stating how much people with unknown names and faces in the industry tried to bring her down.   "I wash bitches man they couldn't even rinse me" - This line could mean that she cleans a person's career meaning it becomes non-existent. However the other "opponent" couldn't even turn on the faucet because that's how far behind they are compared to her.   "She say she hot I said well bitch come and convince me" - It's no question that Nicki is the queen. She's proven it time and time again and continues to do so. There's been plenty of rappers to flood on the scene and they say that their "hot" or the "hottest." She hasn't been convinced that, that's case and she wants to see them back that statement up.   'Ain't no C in green but I'm seeing green" - I think this is a slightly complex bar. She says "ain"t no c in green" listening to the lyrics I can assume that the "c" could stand for "Cash." She's seeing green as in she's seeing money.   "Even with them floor seats they couldn't see the team" - Floor seats are the very first row of seats that is located on the ground and not elevated like the rest of the seats are. "The team" being her, Wayne, and Drake. She's saying even with those seats you couldn't compete with them because they're too good.   "The K-I-N-G, THE GOAT, PLUS ME THE QUEEN" - Claiming their position in the rap game.   "I send shots send em' back or flea the scene" - This is another complex bar. She sends shot, meaning their coming from the gun. "Send em' back," meaning the other opponent stands their ground or punks out and fleas the scene. Kinda like she's testing them. Now calling back to shots and then she says "flea." She's coming back so hard that her "shots" will be painful as a "flea shot." Pen = unmatched   Nicki is an incredible artist and proves continuously whys she is who she is.
God damn I love this beat. What a throwback sound
that fact that I got nicki’s verse down pack💅🏽
This song just made life 10x better. Feels like 2010 again
My boi trizzy version better

All of them are very personal.....This is fire....
I put you six feet deep....I be socially distance
Can’t believe this shit got 15mil views
I scream out free drizzy bcuz i can't listen to or pass Nicki's part...
I am not sure if there is anything that makes me happier than hearing Wayne spitting like that at his age. He had a rough few years, but man he’s been going nuts recently 🔥
Wow
Wow
Wow
It's possible to die from emotions alone. I will never die and anyone that would cause an emtion in me has to die even if I kill them myself, any good man I will kill, it doesn't matter, they all are unnecessary, but of use to God. I know how to make you mad and can make you die from it. I have everything on lock really.
it's weezy baby
Why does feel nostalgic?
I wonder how many times they had to rewrite their verses after they heard waynes verse
This masterpiece Deserve all its flowers chileeee

I was in the studio, he really had his mask on for 7 seconds and he took his mask off, so who ask yall?
Yo whenever Drake is on a track with a chimpmunk choir in the back you know he boutta go off.
They def put the verses in the wrong order. Shoulda been Drake, Nicki & Wayne verse last. I think alot of people kept rewinding Wayne verse and tuning out once Nicki verse gets going but Drake verse slap too
I can't count the number of times I listen to this in a day chile.
she running up more likes than niggas who have 35M+ views
Lets go 20M soon!

She is in her own lane.

Barbz keep streaming beam me up Scotty💖🦄
No puedo dejar de escuchar esta canción 😭 están hermosa ❤️❤️❤️
And by the way seeing green put the fire 🔥 back in my hip hop soul ⚡
Every time I come to your YouTube channel "Queen Onika " I have to find myself resubscribing.. every time I revisit.. when I would never unsubscribe.. because I've been a Barb since itty bitty Piggy.. in the come up DVD . And I'm sure I'm not heck ‼️ because when I go to other YouTube channels😫 I'm still subscribed 👈🏻I'm confused on what's going on..🤔 is this only happening to me 🧐
TE AMO NICKY
Lil Wayne likes watching movies with women and is inspired by the art women create. Women stimulate creativity. Life feels good around women. I'm thinking there needs to be a housing management company called Let's be friends.  The idea would be to organize buildings of either 3 people, 4 people or 20 people.  People will invest with likeminded housemates.  I'm thinking bout setting up a rainbow movement to Nelson. The idea is to promote an ecological environment that will improve the ecology of Earth, thus creating a new age in Earths development known as the man age.
“I can see a wall of y’all all of y’all and run straight through”
Lil Wayne!!! Damn his verse gave me the damn chills…
This track is very refreshing
When wayne took his mask off. The song started fr💯💯

When drake said "I played 48 minutes on a torn meniscus who's subbin" I knew it was over
Best song of the big three: Seeing Green 🤑💸 No frauds ❌👑 Only⚔️🗡️
Lil Wayne’s part in this is under rated
Some see  graffiti as art some can see hoes to be woman

He literally killed this
Wayne is the GOAT
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song is like a solid morning cup of coffee. Gets to ready for anything.
Gucci teddybears and pandas <3

Fanastic!!!!
Crazy how all three went hard, making a song going with seeing green🔥🔥🔥
These b#s still my sons who could ever deny it 😪🔥🥰😍❤️ Nicky is lyrically gifted who could ever deny that!!
"It's corporate giants and machines that went against me". The fact that the whole industry turned their backs on her and she still thriving today. Shows you how strong she is. And that is why we love her so much.
“I know Bae TRUST my VISION but don’t want me SEE prison “  That’s the thing with Wayne , about 65 listens in am I only catching the complexity of that line and it’s a fooking BAR!!!!!!  🐐
How many of yall remember the video of the dj making this beat years ago, and people saying lil wayne would kill this beat, and now here we are with lil wayne actually on the beat now
Who you huggin, who you wanna be lovin'.. Sounds familiar 🤔
God damn they all went dumb
All hail Queen Nicki 👑👸👑👑
They all went hard but Nicki went harder, Lil Wayne had the bars and Drake had the delivery and the flex!
Legendary is all i can say 🤟🏾😎‼️
Finally someone used this beat
Still fucking with this 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn this shit is fire!
stop lil waynes voice is so calming
Here for my daily dose.
Who else know  that chorus part is from Heather Headley song  "in mind mind"
That’s Heather Headley’s song “In my mind” 😳

This shit is fire
Lil Wayne sounds like the belligerent dude at a party to avoid at all costs.
Meme me up scottie
Happy 23M Queen Loveyou🔥❤️
This song is hard but drake ain't no GOAT
Y’all who had the best verse… I’m need CPR

Lil Wayne verse 🔥

Drake verse sounds too ratio'ed
Maaaan Wayne flamed this bitch up 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
big ass backyards just so poppa bear could frolic...
Man, jokes aside, I love Nicki so much. Her music always makes me feel so confident, and has for the past decade. Haters are so mean to her, but I hope she knows what her music does for her fans. Ive struggled with clinical social anxiety for about 6 years, and as silly as it sounds, her music gives me a boost :) love her
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Like Jessy woo said, they thought they got rid of you, But when God shows up, he shows off. We love you Nicki
1. Give Heather Headley her flowers.  2. Nicki Minaj, Drake, and Lil Wayne... please make an album together. 3. Starlito and Don Trip's "Yeah 5x" or Nicki, Drake, and Wayne's "Seeing Green".... which song is better with the Heather Headley sample?
Greatness begins @2:14
The beginning of Nicki verse was weak but the middle and ending was old Nicki🔥🔥🔥
DELETING MY COMMENTS. VERY GOOD. SHAMEFUL ANGRY COMMENTS. COME TO JESUS THE ONLY WAY. NOT PRIDE LUST ANGER CURSING PROMOTING VIOLENCE. YES YOU ARE THE QUEEN OF PROMOTING ANGER AND CRIME AND HATRED. YOU WILL MEET YOUR MAKER AND ALL YOUR FORTUNES WILL NOT TAKE AWAY YOU WILL DIE ONE DAY AND YOU WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SHAME ON YOU!!!!

2021 track of the year 🏆
I remember seeing a video on Facebook of the guy who made this beat and said old Wayne would be fire on it and sure enough I find out that Wayne killed this
Wayne with tha 🐐 verse.
Real bars dnt get respect no more. If this was some kill a nigga shit with a dance it would have had 100mill
They hella took young m.a beat
Wayne with the dirty opening. Details crazy. Muffled audio with the mask on then it gets clear when he takes it off. It's the little stuff like that 🥴
Nicki bad song ever 😖
Wayne said " I know bae trust my vision but dont want to see prison. Said I cant make no promises either leave or come visit" that was hard fr🔥🔥
Nicki gave y'all the reason she went away...The big decision makers kicked her out the circle..it's sad what beef and offending the wrong person will do to you...smh
Can't wait for the abulm but I love her drop it as a surprise cuz these little rappers like cardi are waiting for her to drop that she can drop her's but to avoid drama the Queen 👑 Nick must drop it as a surprise
This is real rap. Ain't heard Wayne and Nikki rap like this in a long time
Big up to the black kings n queens
so glad she came back !

Wayne shit so good he need a part 2
Thanks, now my turn👒👁️
This blessed my eardrums today.
When drake said, “..do numbers on two crutches” it was a triple entendre. 1) obviously Nicki and Wayne are the first two crutches. 2) He was on Degrassi on crutches  And lastly he injured himself and did numbers on the charts as well while he was on crutches 💪🏽

I think they should loop the beat and go in order again. That was beautiful🤣💯🅱
Omg, that old school beat hits
Queen
None of these shits a Dodge 🔥🔥
Now I can finally follow her on IG, I hope that barbie shit full-time  is officially dead and she can officially be the bitch we all fell in love with in 2010. That baby brought that fire back. No more childish lyrics.

I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a façade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB Yes sir

I keep rewinding Wayne verse , I feel like that kid on hardball the one who was good at pitching
Notice how he said Cmb at the end of the song and not ymcmb… Dam yall… time truly is passing faster than we think
We love that old Wayne
Only 12 million views you have to be kidding me...this shit should be at 100 million
The disrespect!  This should be at 50 million views already!
This sound like old Wayne let’s go
Drake went crazy on this shit
When drake started talking at the beginning reminded me of ransom.  Sorry ma I had to do it to em.
They are Young Money. The Big 3
This single  fire….👌👌👌👌💯
My ears are bleeding
I like Nicki but  would have rather her  come back song be a song by herself. If you gonna claim to be the queen on a song, pop out on a song by yourself and don't have other major artists on it that make a song take off by themselves alone. But it's  a nice song though
life is a beach house, dont let the sand in! sheeesh!!!!!

Hey you guys im officially  a barb  Love you onika can't nobody make me change on you queen im really crying because  I literally  always loved nicki and always loved  to see her winning. After the hate train and a whole big machine (label industry) tried to take her down,  but thank God almighty it didn't even work in there favor,  alot of ppl wronged her ,  ppl who she even helped nicki heart is genuine and she's love God that why I will always support her as always  she taught me so much thru her music , everything I listen to her music I feel like she's talking to me and giving me advice   And to the enemies who tried to take  her down guess what , God says he will prepare a place for you In the presence of your enemies. Nicki will always be blessed and will always succeed  amen love you queen.

In the evening for the WEST because the sun sets in that direction.. And right before bed for the NORTH.. where the night star rises 💎💎💙

This is a Dipset type beat
nicki n drake really saved this song cuz wayne wasnt it
I think nicki had the best verse🤧
I love how you can tell Wayne's having fun, and making a point to murder everyone on the song.  Yall overrating Drwke verse tho, he cannot keep up with Wayne

There actually rapping here
Lil Wayne, one love

How can u ever compare to cardi
DopeAzzFukk💉💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Wayne goes at the end, dont forget your place.
This jawn is 🌋🌋🌋
So happy she did the right thing a credited Lil Kim as a writer on this song so every stream and and view on this video puts a coin in Kim's pocket! That's the least Young Money can do after 2010-2012's disrespect to the living legend. Drake has made it right and now it's Nicki's turn.
you knew the trio was back from the first 5 seconds its 2010 all over again!🔥
This song would be literally perfect without Nicki's verse.
The Empire
Just bought a new car, not to drive it just to walk around it.🔥💪
Wayne verse 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was here before the tap pad guy made this
Since the pandemic, they wont let drake leave Canada, I'm screaming free drizzy... like okay weez, we see you
FAST FORWARD TO NICKI!!!!!!! I HEARD THIS IN THE CAR! FUCKING A NICKI!!!
But this wont hit the radio
🥲
I'm not impressed by anyone's verse except, maybe, Drake's.  Flow better.  Too much effort among folks trying to be lyricists which dampens the flow.  Drake gets that.

Nicki and Wayne went crazy but I swear y’all gotta stop sleeping on drake verse lol After I heard “ Your now  tuned in the greatest ever “ I knew drake verse was gon be one for the books!!! 🖤
How is anyone sleeping on this Wayne verse. I feel like young rap fans have completely disregarded Wayne. When I talk about his greatness I get laughed at. Well who else is spitting like this still in 2021? Not many.
I heard this 🔥🔥🔥🔥💰

Queens alll Day GREEENNN
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This beat fire. This should be #1
Don't forget to stream super bass too
Ooowee baby!! Wayne rode that beat like a jock on a horse
Wayne said “ Nina Ross on my hip, the 44 is my mistress”  a. Nina being 9mm and a 44 revolver  b. “Nina Ross” Ross as in Rick Ross and 44 referring to Rick’s old  waistline size  c. He personified his 44 as his mistress. A mistress is the woman whom you’d see when you sneaked around. He said his Nina is on his hip as a main girlfriend or wife would be.
I told em Nikki the “Empress” Queen of all Queens bytch why you think she keep It classy but still an OG.... Nikki I love it 🔥🔥🔥... SERVE THEY ASS # Cokianna approve💯💪🏾❤️

Love this song, listen closely and you can hear all three of them taking shots at current rapper's. This collaboration hit harder than anyone that has done a feature with them. Triple Threat changed the 2010's, and she will change the 2020's with adding substance to rap lyrics.

Shout-out to Heather Headley who's In My Mind sample was used in this song. I don't listen to rap music that often  but I gotta say Nicki had the best verse on this song IMO.
Outstanding production.  I mean epic beat.
#nickiiscoming #Queen #letsgo #seeinggreen
#seeinggreen #YoungMoney #Drake #lilwanye #nicki
💚 Nicki Minaj 🙌🏽🙂
Happy to see real music back
Listen closely to Wayne's first two bars. The man literally had a mask on and took it off🤦🏾‍♂️😭
As a barb and a cardi fan I have to admit we played a huge part in the beef the tweets ,slick shots etc and people in the industry made them beef cardi had always loved and danced to nickis music and Nicki tweeted cardi and congratulated her on “bodak yellow” but They always put women again each other...I really hope they talk and drop a bomb ass single or even a album
Weezy takes the cake in this one.
LIL WAYNE IS FXKING AMAZING.
Wayne had the best verse to me idc what anybody say💯
*ARMY PRESENT......*  STREAM SEEING GREEN X BUTTER FOREVER SUPPORT AUNT NICKY MINAJ
“Leave the keys to you heart next to ya soul and ya spirit” that stuck w/ me🤚🏽😭
Minaj’s flo is better than Wayne’s and Drake’s. She said she Häagen-Dazs it....the K-I-N-G, Q-U-een, G-O-A-T.  Lol
This for Sure a 💎

I wonder how the crowd gonna erupt when this played on stage especially if Nicki does a world tour again.
Goated
Lil wayne and Drake part fire
"I should cop a New Jersey, that's word to Camden!" Jerzy shit!
Insanely fire
Nicki Minaj  is THE BEST FEMALE RAPPER EVER! Like if you agree
For the people listening with headphones at 2:50 when Nicki said that part I always feel somebody talking to me in my background

Love you all for this thank you don't think that we have words for how greatful I am for all the artist that have taken part in this and all that have and are going to be a part of this they are all the grand choir so that kind of means like some bad s*** right there if you know what I'm talking about and at point that I don't have anymore words one can say thank you all always with love ReZ1 Weatherman Darth Vice Vash humanoid typhoon Masonry and also May 16-2018 became the international Day of Light I just found out this year so got shit going thank you all
Queen 👑 ❤️ ❤️🔥🔥
No one finds it weird people try and compare cardi to this women🤦🏾‍♂️😂
DON'T PUT NO K AFTER THE B DAWG BAD MOVE🔥🔥🔥🔥
"The K-i-n-g, The goat, plus me The Queen"
It’s funny you can hear Wayne take his mask off in the beginning . Listen to the difference . He was really in the studio taking his mask off
I put you six feet deep, I'm being socially distant WAYNE BACK BABY
MY TEAM BACK 🖤
I’ve always loved young money 💙
This single sounds like the music they made back in 2010 ❣️😭
So is she shading Cardi on Meg on that verse? 😂
Wayne killed this beat.
Fiya 🗣🗣
I fucking love this song
Best
There is no reason the Barbs didn't make this go number one. Everyone was dissing cardi because of Big Paper flop, yet seeing green was number 14 week one and number 48 week two. If I were Nicki, I would be disappointed with my fans. Stop exciting these other girls and focus on me, the Queen. The Barbs need to do better. How is UP higher on the chart than seeing green? Drake fans helped him go number 1,2 and 3 the first week. Itty bitty piggy should've been in the top ten. I faithfully played beam me up Scotty at least 3-4 times a day to get her higher on the charts because this is my all-time favorite album/mixtape. Barbs keep the other female artist out of our mouth and boycott their music until the Queen is number 1-10 first week on the chart when the album drop. The other girls are Irrelevant at this point and should never be mentioned or followed again.
"Play 48 minutes on torn meniscus who subbin..."smh...wild💯💯💯💯
Nicki is the Queen, stop playing Bitch, My Daughter is the G.O.A,T
Thank you!!!
Damn , yo it's just simply one of the Craziest Collaborations. Love these 3. #JustSimple
NICKI  MURKED AND BODIED!!!!!!!!!
This feels like 2010.  Makes me feel young again.   Damn
Yeah~ yeah yeah~~~~~
A dime in two weeks what they talking bout queen
To much 🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!!
🔥🔥
Esto si es letra. No solo es decir bla bla bla, Sino interpretar con coherencia. Nicki Minaj, Lil & Drake. Reyes. 👍
YM this is what we needed 💯🔥
What a master piece. Great job. Peace.
Shout out Starltio and Don Trip for killing a song with this sample first (yeah 5x Stepbrothers 3)

That dude made this beat and now everyone jumping on it I appreciate this. But I wanna know that kid that made this back in 2010 and didn’t get the recognition..
Wore a gat before a tattoo I had to as a matter fact I had 2🔥🔫
I hope this Wayne's here to stay.

Anyone interested in what this sample is from?   Starlito x Don Trip - Yeah 5x
🤴🏿🤴🏿🤴🏿🤴🏿🤴🏿👸🏾👸🏾👸🏾👸🏾👸🏾👸🏾🇮🇱
Keep rhyming "hoe in atlanta" with "hoe in atlanta"  Clever
Unrated and underrated.
They gotta have a music video for this, miss these big 3
Drake deserved the Billboard artist of the decade.  The man has more relevant hits than any other artist ever.  But Drake wouldn't have been as big without Nicki and Wayne.  Collaborative and competitive teammates are healthy.  So healthy, they are one the most successful ever.  But I say all that to say this:  Hearing Wayne on this track brought me back to mixtape Wayne.  When he took everyone else's singles and just recorded bars (sometimes no hooks).  Can we all take a moment to realize how seriously good his lyrics are: he said put you 6 ft deep, I'm being socially distant.
LEGENDARY!!!!!!!!!
Queen！！！！！！！！
Alutta Continue 👊🙏
Been repeating this for hours now I'm seeing green
The  flippant anthropology syntactically correct because denim increasingly repair failing a observant shovel. breezy, enchanting cloudy
Damn they went crazy on this track💯🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥So live, it gave me chills🔥🔥 nicki minaj is a sagittarius. i feel most of her flows. wayne the goat and back! drake adds the sauce.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🔥🔥🔥
Did you notice that when Wayne says "take my balenciaga mask off” his Voice is so much cleaner like he really take off his mask

Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene You know, one of the perils of makin' money  Is you can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj And y'all still dyin, ' man, wassup? We in this bitch This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin' Who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin'? Who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a façade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB Yes sir

THIS is what we need! Nicki still has it! Wayne proved he’ll never fall with Carter V but Nicki has been struggling. This is what we need, you guys bring the best out of each other.   I think Nicki had the best verse easy. Something about this beat just sent all 3 of them to 2010 again and it was magnificent.
Good morning.
“Your girl was better in the morning like a slice a pizza”
Bro how they hop on this before meek…. 💔😩
Nicki is the GOAT of all female rappers
Weezy went hard
Wayne and drake carried this joint
10 MILLY

I NEVER thought I would EVER hear in a rap the word badonkadonk. Lil Tunechi only💪
This is when YMCMB was flexing regularly...they cane bk just ta show dem...Weezy nd Nicki cane hard but I feel drizzy got too comfortable wit his reign...ca Wayne ain’t never left just in this era of streams whilst he was gone shit changed but he gave drizzy da alley oop before he went through his shit...da guy is a LIVING LEGEND when u check it nd how he set these up to b who they r TODAY?! Weezy verse crayyyy?!

You the money blue  Yet it has been it has been green and orange  Just like a the University of Miami Sippin on the Sailor Jerry with some coke  I did what I had to do just to get to this moment  Political side of everything People thinking that laying down with a friend  Too many deaths of bachelors  This is why they want to now I critical kill internet  All this random raps and no media of doing stuff in the communities that gave you opportunity  Daniel Rita Also knew everything  They blame was on Katrina and Rita Makes me think of when I was actually doing stuff with beauty Mean while they only want to talk about blunts  Caught up in the talent shows  Where is the beauty  A new mall or community  doesn't do anything when you are trying not to do a jabralter  Due to the spawn kills Whats been going wrong  They didn't want to talk to me or the teams Gave you opportunities  Still management trying to save money  Yet not restoring the core  Back in the day we planned it out like a crew  Talking with out payments  Makes me have to go and get Lety  And I am not talking of my homie ex Safi
Nicki not playing with her peasants lmao I grew up listening to Onika she is my generation ❤️ But I do love Megan too 😩😭. But I still LOVE MY ONIKAAAAAAA
Put you six feet under social distancing

BE NOT DECEIVED: neither FORNICATORS, nor idolaters, NOR ADULTERERS, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind

When they collab it’s always a problem 🔥🔥🔥 Weezy on his shit on this track
I've made a Confetti remix ft. Nicki 👑
All three of them have lines saying something about “seeing green” is that just coincidence? Or a reference that I’m not getting

We been waiting for this.....
It does sound like a Dip Set type beat. Jim Juelz Cam'ron.. I need them on the remix. Hard track. I bet we hear a few more rappers go off this beat ✊🏾
I'm sure Cardi listens to it!😁
Big Ups Nikki Drake. All of em GOOD. Hands down Wayne the GOAT 🐐👸🏽🤵
Like this
does anyone remember the guy making this beat in his car?
Nicki 😔😗
this is a very boring track. holy
Just noticed all them use "seeing green" in they verse 👌🏾 i like how yall did that
The best thing about nicki minaj's entire album was that last drake verse.
When Wayne said “lemme take this Balenciaga mask off” yhu can actually hear his voice clear up as if he actually took his mask off 🔥🔥
Crazy this was on spotify like a month ago??? Or maybe I've listened to many times it just sent me back and forward through time
😍😍😍😍😍💋
Nikki and Wayne killed it. But the way Drake came in...you already knew he was gonna body the beat! 🥶 #longevity
Oh have we missed YMCMB but this wasn’t as good
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
Young Money are back at it spitting facts
Bruh nicki went in
Wayne’s confidence makes his bars hit really different. Just good as he was in ‘08
He said he's know as THE goat 🤣🤣🤣 FOH
This is fucking amazing
2010 here we go again 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like this Nicky Blicky boss ish waaay more than that Minaj sh"#. She has bars and I might turn into a fan if she gives more of this wave. Boss B.
it just hit me that lil waynes voice sounded muffled the first few secs because he had a Balenciaga mask on ...lol my dumb ass was blaming the producers before i caught it

Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B-Boy, "Bad kall," that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me "Nicki, cock the blicky," the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Nicki Minaj:] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Drake:] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

Seeing green is the best👌😍😍😍
🔥🔥🔥
This is legendary. Nicki is the shit period    and Nicki is using  *Authentic views*  to get views
Fire Song 🔥....But, who do you think had the illest verse. In my opinion, all 3 verses were nice but I gotta give the edge to Wayne, Nikki, Drake in that order. Not just saying Wayne because he's super dope either. I think Nikki had a nicer verse than Drake. Nevertheless, all 3 are great MC's. Emphasis on the word MC. Not every rapper is a MC. You have rappers and then MC's.
Keep Streaming #seeinggreen #barb4life #YoungMoney
I am new to rap so not sure if this is how its supposed to be) but first and last rappers have rather annoying voices while Nincki Minaj is much better!!! Even though im not much into rap i must say i admire Nicki. Her face very much reminds me of the lovely Virgin Mary!!

Yeaaaahhh yeah yeaaaaaaah simple but powerful👊🏾🎯

This track is FUCKING PHENOMENAL!!! Imagine a remix or extended version with Rick Ross & Meek Millz. That would be extra LIT!! 🔥🔥🔥
You know Nicki does this for the love of the music and not for numbers because she really said this not no tik tok shit .. like you can’t just get hyped up to it and forget it. This some reflective, real music.
YOUNG MONEY IS BACK!! SALUTE TO YOU QUEEN!
Two Kings and  A Queen on a song.

My art is from a culture that is private of the private. Oh so, valuable it is to you, yes? I know. If you are one of the ones having sex you aren't going to live forever and don't make up my faithful wives I have 1,000's no one can get. If you aren't one of them by now the door is closed forever. Who else ain’t ready?! #Noah(except no one gets left out of my kids.)

Come on Guys

Jesus loves you, today is the day where you can receive salvation. Jesus Christ is coming back soon. You must repent of your sins. Turn to Christ before it be too. Surrender to Jesus and live a righteous lifestyle. And turn from your wicked ways. Truly God is angry with the wicked everyday. God is having mercy on you while yet your still alive rn and breathing. I encourage you to do the following that is listed below. But it is your choice whom ye will serve this day. But let this be a warning the consequences of you dying without Christ and into your sins then you're on your way to hell. The good news is Jesus died on the cross for your sins so that you may have life.  1. Believe that Jesus Christ is real and the true living God. 2. Repent of your sins, and ask God to forgive you of your sins. And invite Christ into your life and accept him as your personal Lord and Savior. 3. Read Acts 2:38 4. Ask the Lord to fill you with his Holy Ghost. 5. Let God teach you and seek Him

You can also archive a YouTube comment and make it not noticeable to public sort of a ban if you might
I see you deleted the comment of y’all deleteing the first part of lil Wayne’s video and silencing my comment why ??
I’m gonna expose it all
Hard pass for me... garbage

fyyeee
This is what 2020 needed glad it came in 2021!! I love this vibe I’m catching chills! Chile!!!!
2021 Great Bars from all Emcees
PA PA PA! You was a good cat, My bad DOG!!
Just bought a new car not to drive it but to walk around it, love the queen of rap
We've been missing this for a long time, love the big three match
Nicki never fails us 🔥
YMCMB comeback?
Ok but chance vibes right👀?
Clásico
Don trip beats be sooo fuccin fire !
The only female rapper id endorse
DO U LIKE HILARY CLINTON
Trizzy in my mind...watch dude murder this beat
Yeah x5 starlito that the original I think
Come thruuuuu
This fire but young M.A bodied this beat already
👑🐐🐐🐐💯 & for anyone saying lil Wayne is back, he's been here the whole time y'all just ain't listening 🤦‍♀️👀 he has dropped hella shit this year already and last year & been in HELLA features, he's been going hard af. If you haven't already deff give a listen to some of the shit he been featured in lately, Miseducation, Call me nobody, Thankful, Gold fronts, Oops, timeless, my window, the what's popping remix, run,  & those are just the features!! Then you got his single Ain't got time & Green & yellow that he dropped right after no ceilings 3 & a single NFL, plus he dropped the deluxe version songs of ThaCarterV and they ALL go hard af, plus releasing no ceilings & free weezy album on streaming. & He dropped the whole Funeral album just last year. No disrespect I just think people don't give weezy enough recognition anymore bc they don't hear all his new shit on mainstream radio and it's a shame bc he been releasing good ass shit constantly and he really hasn't done the overly auto tuned sound in a while but that's all people remember bc the radio. Which lowkey idk why people think he was tryna fool people with it I'm sure that was the point to make himself have the distinct overly auto tuned sound, made everyone who didn't already, know exactly who he was right? So I think it worked 🤷‍♀️ but fr y'all go check out all the newer stuff the features too bc he KILLS every single one. Absolutely no one compares to weezy lyrically he don't just be saying shit his metaphors are so insane they go right over people's head if they don't pay attention. 💯💯🐐🐐 and if you like Green ☘️♻️🥦fr then check out Weezy weed he has his own brand Gkua ultra premium. @Gkuaofficial on insta. 💯 he been working constantly between his brand , Young Money artist and he also founded Young Money APAA sports agency. Don't ever think weezy sleeping, he rapping, working and lighting the blunt ofc 💨💯🐐
SEEING GREEEEN 🤑🤑🤑🤑🦄
FLOW SO SICKKKK!💖😩
THE QUEEN IS BACCKKK!🦄
I like how Drake just said “CMB”. It’s been so long since their last collab and they aren’t “Young” Money anymore. So now they’re just Cash Money Billionaires. It’s a bittersweet feeling for people who’ve been fans of them since they first came together.

"I put ya 6 feet deep I'm bein' socially distant" - Wayne 2021
Gawd damn
"I send Shots send em back or flee the scene"  Nicki don't give a fuck! 😩
Aint ever gotta talk about it when you are about it !
This jus came out and it’s already one of my favvv💅🏽 The BIG 3 never disappoint. My favorite artist since 2012 and will always be my fave❤️ Sending love from the Caribbean. We love you Onika🥰
"known her 8 years and still f*ck her like a new husband". Goals!
Wayne ain't go this hard in 7 years or more. Nicki killed it. Drake was basura and off beat
Nobody can match Nicki flow!!
Nicki Minaj is the real pioneer of the cockiest female rap style, not all this other female copycats... 😏
No equal for Nicki. She will Deliberately drown any female rappers  in the Music arena/ Industry. There's only one Nicki in the rap game that constructively and lyrically give the people and fans what they want. Her rap is poisonous and  her  flow is dangerous like the atomic bomb 💣
These Bitches time's tick tocking better stick to dancing 🤯 that's killshot that's not just trowing a shot. Cardi-B Gonna ans?
80k a week we did it !!
They all back on their bags on here, im crying with joy right now 🔥😪🔥
After listening to this,I have to conclude that Nicki is NO QUEEN OF RAP.....               BUT THE GODDESS OF RAP🦄🦄🦄🦄 #streamsuperbass
Love you queen!

I played this song on my mobicell device, it's an IPhone right now. Man the beat was nostalgic, the rappers delivered and the build up was worth it. Definitely one for the books
This beat came from the guy in his car who was on his beat machine that went viral on IG 🤯🤯🤯
Absolute fire 🔥
I spent a majority of my youth pretending to be someone I wasn’t. I wanted so desperately to be cool, to be noticed, to be liked..I didn’t like who was staring back at me in the MIRROR. I LIED to sound interesting, I LIED to appear funny, I LIED to get anyone to notice me. I wanted GIRLS to notice me...I was constantly chasing that relationship with ANYONE.. Since 2nd grade, constantly seeking the opposite sex. In 6th grade, I began to think about sex..alot I began to “self satisfy” any chance I got. Looking back at the habits I developed in that mindset...it makes me hang my head in shame. My Grandparents divorced, my parents divorced..it only made sense I was seeking that “intimacy”...any intimacy would do the job.. Habits I developed in my youth, overflowed and poured over into my Adulthood..almost cost me my marriage, my relationship with my children..it almost cost me my LIFE..  🩸🩸🩸🕊🕊🕊 I don’t write this, in search of pity.. I don’t share this, to tell you a story.. YOU ARE READING THIS RIGHT HERE AND NOW IN THIS MOMENT, because YOU made a choice, to watch this video and scroll through the comments, like you have always done.  But this time is different, because THIS is the moment someone brought you the good word 🙏🏽 That there is a God that sits on high, and he is waiting for you. He is waiting for you to lift up the past you’ve let drive your present, up to him! He is waiting for you to pull away from the habitual sin you have been living in! He is waiting for you to shout his name in praise on your darkest nights! He is waiting for you to stop asking the questions that don’t matter, and dig into his word! Waiting for you to take hold of the fact he sent his son to die the death that YOU AND I DESERVE!! Waiting for you to dig into his word for your redemption! The redemption that awaits the vessel developed in love, the vessel with the royal blood of heaven flowing through its veins!  This is for you!! The one who couldn’t stare in the mirror, the one who died!! This is for the one that HAS NO OTHER PLACE TO GO..BECAUSE THE LORD OUR GOD FOLLOWS US INTO THE DEEPEST PLACES, THE DARKEST PLACES, JUST TO TELL US HOW MUCH HE LOVES US, AND HAS PLANS TO PROSPER YOU AND TO NEVER HURT YOU!!  LOOK INTO THE MIRROR!! LOOK DEEP INTO YOUR OWN EYES!! PREACH TO YOURSELF!! TALK TO YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER AND ACCESS THE PATH THAT LEADS TO HIS GLORY, TO HIS WILL!!  Look into the mirror, acknowledging that you have FOUND GOD, and begin your WALK WITH GOD..by developing a relationship with his son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ 🕊🕊🕊  LOOK INTO THE MIRROR...  And start the habit of seeing YOURSELF, the way GOD SEES YOU..  Created in his image, beautifully made, for MEANING AND PURPOSE  🕊🕊🕊🩸🩸🩸  🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽Glory be to God!!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽  If you have read this far, God bless you, if you have a few minutes listen to my NEW song “Mirror Image” on my page. Shut down everything else and join me as I  share many of the thoughts that I had with MYSELF, while looking into the mirror.. Join me as I talk to the man staring back at me, my MIRROR IMAGE 🕊🩸🙏🏽  https://youtu.be/hpFeh1l5YcA

Out of the beat
Just by hearing the intro you already know this is gonna be a banger 🔥
Don't put no K after that B boy... that's a bad call -Streetgangs put K after rival gang names to represent Killer, of that gang. -In baseball a walk is written as BB and a strikeout is written as a K. And in baseball many perceive umpires as making Bad Calls.
Yeah Nicki... wayne...i feel this song family this is a hits people ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️😎🎶🎧🎤
A1 verse by Wayne. Really nice to here a true 🔥 verse in 2021. The wordplay, metaphor usage, the double entandras, and the placement and timing are all on point here. Youngster take notes 📝

Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B-Boy, "Bad kall," that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me "Nicki, cock the blicky," the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir
Lil Wayne is GAY I hate gays

Wayne killed it from the start 🤯
15 year old me is screaming at this Nicki album. Soo nostalgic.
My favorite trio!! <3
he said i’ll put you six feet deep i’m being socially distance
that nigga wayne a god bruh
Wheezy sounds like chance the rapper ... 😂
Cardi B nor Megan tha Stallion can't fuck with Nikki. Nikki has a story to tell through her music with with intellectual words that she uses and all Cardi and Megan rap about is their vagina every since they hit the mic...I'm like is that as far as your mind and vocabulary can go🙄.... a 3 year old can find something much more interesting to talk about. They can't compete where they don't compare. #TeamNikki all day💪
OMG I've just noticed Wayne was really taking the mask off. Iconic.
man that suckkkkked
Now this is the lil Wayne I remembered
Performance that will leave u shook! Stray Kids Deadpool concept https://youtu.be/cDTG6o1vC2I

Can't wait for Rick Ross remix on this this beat belong to him.
Yo she said call me "Nicki cop the blicky the Minaj is silent" 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I like how she Gave Cam his roses on this track. This sounds do much like Dipset/Duke da god
I like this song this but I feel like this song is in the wrong order Nicki should have went first then drake then Lil Wayne. Lil Wayne is always should be the caboose in any song with other people in song. Drake should be the middle, and Nicki should have introed the song. Honestly this a top 5 Nicki song overall. Amazing beat and lyrics. The only thing is just the order.( best song in the album)
Warning of the UFOS lmao they knowing something
🔥🔥🔥
Somebody start a challenge to this jawn #barsisback 😎💪

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Drake : knw her 8 years still f..* her like a husband 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wayne the best fukkin rapper alive!!!! He said so much crazy shit in that song, ppl wonder why I still see him the way I still c him, they say"hes dried up and dun" alright, go listen to dedication 6 reloaded, and funeral, not sure of his latest project, but I'm still bumping d6 and funeral, plus the suffix and prefix, droughts, no ceiling's, fuk sat u heard, he is at top of everybody's playlist, fukkin genius rapper
Queen of rap 🔥❤️🥺
These amateurs can’t find the crown... that’s because it’s on Nicki’s head.

We need this,we want this
Why she's drake's vocals sounds like that? It's he recording on an IPhone?
then they still have the audacity to say that cardi is better than nicki… smh.🤦🏽‍♂️
Nicki need to practice switching up the flow

Jesus Christ is the way ,the truth and the life. God created the heavens and the 🌍 . God created the stars, the trees , the different animals and the skies. God created the mountains. God is real . God exists. Jesus Christ is Lord. Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour ❤️. Follow the 10 commandments and love and serve God only. Repent from your sins and allow Jesus into your heart. Jesus loves you all and he wants to have a relationship with you. Acknowledge that Jesus Christ is alive and that he died for your sins on the cross so that you will not be condemned. Heaven is real and Hell is real. Accept that Jesus is real and that he died for your sins.
The big three back and talking their shit!

This khleo thomas song
Let's play a game... Where were you  whenever you first heard this bangger 🔥 🔥 🔥    Edit... Personally I heard it on the radio in Lafayette Louisiana as I was rushing my wife to the emergency room on 5/17/2021 during a flash flood. Almost had to swim to the emergency room. But I still took the time to remember that this song will be used as a marker for most. Years from now we will all remember exactly what we were doing whenever this dropped
This is amazing but still Starlito & Don Trip Yeah 5x  Is really 5x better
😂😂😂This nigga really took his mask off tho
This one is not it 😑.....
Drake shouting out lil kim with that who you loving who you want to be hugging... I hope nicki and kim can come to some understanding because their both Queens....nicki is showing growth and that is the most beautiful thing coming from a queen....
How can anyone not appreciate a no auto tune Wayne.? He delivers everytime.
“i’m already known as the goat” 🐐
Love this beat 🔥🔥
"He was a good cat... my bad dog."  ...HA! I miss this wayne.

#seeinggreen she is done with the fake ppl.
If I’m correct there were two lines that Nicki dissed Megan in, “These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics” and “She said she hot well bitch come and convince me”. I don’t know what Megan did specifically but Nicki went for the throat lol.
Ion like Nicki but this heat

Nicki is really ‘the white sand beach’ of rap genre...you just get hit with different feelings experiencing her!
So is Nicki Minaj a Trekkie?
"Im da greedist shark amongst da ocean of killas" who ever said he fell off wayne never fell off dat part
Nicki with the most quotable verse iktr ☝
The queen is back!❤️🔥🔥🔥
Wayne’s the goat but this drake verse is dirt
" its all fun and games till i wanna play, too"
I'm smoking some...
🐐×3=🔥🔥🔥
The prettiest barbie of them all is BACK💕🥺🐐😫🗣
It’s been a while, but whenever these 3 jump on the track, FLAMES!!!
Lil Wayne is in a group of rappers that can operate at the highest frequency effortlessly. Some styles cant be imitated or duplicated. And he is a 1 of 1. Truly under appreciated greatness. There are Legends and then there are once in a generational talents. ppl who make great artists look like they are trying to be something close to what Lil Wayne is. He deserves all the accolades and so much more. Hip hop owes him more than any other in the game, been doin it since the 90's only raising the bar every time u hear him, also solely responsible for the rise of 2 legendary artists in Nicki and Drake ( he murdered both of them on this track ). Also 2 eras in hip hop with young money and og cash money while the entire time giving master class in being the definition of an Artist

🌌
Iam the stand out ur just the stand in ....Nicki out for blood
Tunechi was so honest.❤🙏🏾
Tunechi killed it. Like for real, he went ham.
Where Wayne says “I use to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee and Lisa Dee on Eagle Street. Drake is a good friend of mine Momma Dee yells at me every day cause I forget to give her her kiss on the cheek when I get there. An Miss Lisa all ways yelling at me. I know them they are real people and that’s not just a verse. Wayne use to live right next door to them. They all talk about it all the time. An tell everyone he use to live next door.
🥇💞🧞‍♀️🏆
Nicki The Bully lol
I love in my mind my heather headly
Damn that Toronto kid can do no wrong.

Nicki Minaj is more than Queen. She's a Legend
Sounds nostalgic af. Kinda song I would play on a late night drive
I’m sorry but I don’t even know what Wayne is rapping about. He just says anything and it’s OLD
like nicki
Can’t stop listening to this 🔥🔥🔥❤️ . Thank you young money 🌹🙏
I'm sorry but the music is crap
👂🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺
Wayne said PLANdemic
Music is like we are all hanging out even if we have to be distant.
This reminds me of the old days 😩 !! , ILOVEITTT 👸🏽🥰🥰🥰🥰
Worse song of 2021, its fuckin shit Let the hate begin 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Legendary

Let’s see how many subs I can get from this  Current: 15      Ogga boogaloo I’m watching you 😆 lmao
Laughed at the putin line) love from russia to the goats! 🇷🇺 🇷🇺 🇷🇺
Dam it sounds like Wayne Back🚀Nikki❤️Drake🗳
Drake, Wayne and Nicki is like Rodmam, Pippen, Jordan in the 90s... Literally shed a tear listening to this masterpiece
Yall remember in her documentary when she said "if i dont do the stankface when i hear the song, then it aint good." This whole track is one continuous stankface 🤙🏽
I KNEW THIS TR!ZZY BEAT WAS GOING TO SHINE!!!! IF YOU LIKE THE SONG FOR DA BEAT DROP A LIKE.
Life is a beach ⛱house, don't let the sand in, I ball in any arena go let the fans in, I should cop a NEW JERSEY THATS WORD TO CAMDEN!!! 💥

Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress"
Drake cheated the damn game with dat 1st line my nigga ✊🏾👌🏾💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 new level of respect for you my brotha‼️ #NeverForgetWhereUCame4rm
nicki is so fine too me
Trash
Nikki Minaj is washed up. She hasn't evolved at all in the 10+ years since she blew. That's why her flow is boring now, and why Cardi B took the crown from Nikki. I'm not even a fan of Cardi B, but she now raps circles around Nikki.
SHES BACKKKKK 🔥
VIBES
“Let me take this balenciaga mask to ask y’all who asked y’all ?”   You can literally hear him taking off the mask 🔥🔥🔥  Lmao my favorite part
Just bought a new car not to drive it but to walk around it. Big flex🙌🏻
Got dayum Wayne hopping straight the fuck in! Been hearing ads for this song on pandora the last few days, why tf have I not blessed my ears with this heat by now

Lil Wayne is the GOAT. If you argue with this, you know nothing about music.
Really sound like some 04 Dipset shit. I like it.
Nicki could rap to any music and her voice compliments it. No one could take the crown from her.
When they collab  it's always heat
She said it ain't for Tik tok but she stillll allll up in there explore 😂
Dope ,drop another
This the culture!!! 💪🏾 we not making tiktok music. This for the real ones.

Sounds like khleo in my soul
Sounds like Khleo Thomas song in my soul just saying 🤷🏽‍♀️
KHLEO THOMAS
Anyone here from Khleo’s 2010 version?
The original song was better by Khleo Thomas. You guys stole the instrumental , the flow and some words/lyrics. 100% stolen. Its 2021 and these industry clowns still cant be original. I'd like to give some respect for wayne but nah. You guys stole this song. Stop rapping about how "people stole yo swag" when u stealing a whole vibe off someone else's song. U fuckers got so much money so why dont you pay Khleo Thomas for his work then. Pathetic!
Lil wayne let's go
...in ANY room... copied my homework, that's what they hand in... ...don't let the sand in... (repeat)...
This track hard
buy SEEING GREEN, pls
Khleo Thomas - in my soul 2010 is good too, it’s the exact same beat he says seeing green, there both good tho
Camden stand the fuck up
This song so weak. They all trying too hard. It's not natural. It's like serena Williams getting married and getting a baby, then come back...she not the same. Wayne voice is weak, nicki you cool but you trying too hard but drake is right there in the relay...finishing strong but you guys didn't win. All three of you all, just do features from now on.
wowwwww wezzzzy bodddyyyy thiss!!!!!! with ou thim theres no nicki nor drake they did good but iim sorry you can tel there flows come from the original, fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 bar after bar < who knows anything about that ??
Wayne you fell off big time

My Queen ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍🥰
Honestly.... Wayne made this legit, It sounded nice to hear some classic Wayne opening up on this beat... Then I kind of lost interest lol. Nicki just talking about her rich life and her big ass.... And Drake is just bad.

After Wayne's verse, everything else is mediocre, hard to follow after Wayne.
No one can pronounce words better than Nicki, man. Shorty press the pronunciation clearly like a pressed bxtch. School is really beneficial, you guys...Don’t just be in school, learn while in school.

The last 2 decades Lil Wayne showed us so much rapping versatility through numerous features singles albums n mixtapes even crossing over to the Rock n roll side for fun (why not) even if it wasn’t perceived well to the Hip Hip world it was done ✅ and towards the end of his 2nd decade he introduced us to Drake (2007) and since then they’ve collaborated some of the most timeless records of this era. Before mumble and drill music was a thing. Now Drake 13yrs later is getting rewarded for the last 10 🏆 again an artist who’s showed us so much versatility in this music industry. Classic features, singles mixtapes n albums. In 2008 on his only diss track at the time “Goodnight & Goodluck” he said ‘Music’s enjoyable I’m just tryna bring the fun back’ and he did. The dude is a genius and deserves that award with no surprise from me I’ve paid attention to every project and how strategically everything is done he made a strong team of friends (OVO) which is now a top brand and legendary movement in Canada 🇨🇦 United States 🇺🇸 UK 🇬🇧 and beyond. His legacy is set. Nicki career started from her 1st mixtape ‘Playtime is Over’ (2007) around the same time Lil Wayne found Drake, she was signed to Young Money then followed with ‘Sucka Free’ (2008) and ‘Beam Me Up Scotty’ (2009) and my all time favorite cameo shortly after that tape when she was in Gucci Mane ‘Bricks’ video at the beginning and throughout by his side in the main scenes 😍 just 1 year later her debut album ‘Pink Friday’ released 2010 and its been history since. Lil Wayne birth these 2 great artists that the 🌎 can’t seem to get enough of and we all should give him that credit when due. The 🐐 @liltunechi
Nicki Minaj ain't playing with these ghostwriter.
Wayne sheesh!!!!
I love the beat. That vibe was sick.. Wayne spit fire. The rest was meh for me, even Drake which was a surprise. I'd play this if it came on XM while in my car, but wouldn't stream or purchase. I like it overall though
Nicki 😘🤩😍
Salve Brazil like 💯

This is why Nikki’s the goat !!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me "Nicki, cock the blicky," the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'  He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene - Nicki entire Verse

“I’ll put you six feet deep, I’m socially distanced” Damn wayne, we see you
This shit so hard 😭😭😭😭
Drake ainda tem os motores lubrificados.
JT from City girls needs to learn how to respect to one only Queen. Oh Megan Cardi B and a few of the newest female rapper are okay they got some bars that hit hard  but they all could use some tips from the True realest female rapper in our times. They came out to show out to let all this young rapper how it really done. The best thing happen during some of the most hardest times. The ture trio just brought back some hardest tracks that takes us older fans back to where we would did wild ass shit . All 3 has always have been my favorite who really knew how to get the worlds attention. As if they been here since the rap game got started. So good to hear lil Wayne he really did some bad ass bars And even throw some shade at Meek pretty much saying We still ain't done dissing your bitch ass like we use to and  we still to this day have Our girls back and when  she needed Them the most they showed her that there is true friend who will help you get back to the top and she is making sure they come along with her. To hear the old school lil Wayne and the real Gucci when then had some fire in the soul and show the world that even after a good 10 years the realest rapper and always come back harder then they did the first time. ..... 😂🤣....
Stream !!!!
Damn drake wanna go back to the ol days?? I'm here
Drake really said "Just packed a GARAGE, none of this shits is a (dodge), none of this shits a facade (passat), none of this shits a mirage (mitsubishi mirage) so he talking About cars that aren't in his garage while still saying none of the shit you see him do is a facade or a mirage." Just different.
This type of musiq is not being promoted anymore and It won't be promoted ever again.....So, just forget about our trio coming back. Y'all know this😂😂😂 y'all think Wayne doesn't wanna rap again? Haha 😂
“No one bitch could be my opp that shit offends me, it’s CORPORATE GIANTS & MACHINES that went against me” ~Queen

This song made me miss Heather Hadley and appreciate Nicki so much more!!! Thanks for saving hip hop
Can't believe I slept on the album 😭😭🔥💯💯
This my summer anthem. Queen legend the ICON
Drake started it off with a damn near quadruple entendre . " This not going to be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches".  4 meanings: 1.Drake's character on Degrassi was on crutches for while and him being shot boost the show ratings 2. Drake tore his ACL in 2009 on stage during that time he was the hottest name in music game selling crazy records from his "Best I Ever Had" single and So Far Gone mixtape that was repackaged as an Ep that sold over 700,000 going into 2010. 3. Recently he tore his meniscus which had him on crutches and was still the highest streamed artists of that year 4. Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne are Drake's support (2  crutches) throughout his career and most of their songs together are multi-platinum as well as this song destine to be platinum or multi-platinum  Another double entendre from Drake's verse . " . "You niggas can't trouble me from the Double Tree" 2 meanings: 1.He's stunting on niggas saying you can't afford to be at places I stay, which is why you stay at the Double Tree hotel 2. In Toronto "tree" is also slang for number three, so he's  saying double 3 which equals 6 and 6 is the nickname for Toronto  This line is aimed at his haters from his city. He's telling them you niggas don't have enough resources to pose a threat to me.   Another double entendre from Drake's verse. " Want to see my niggas ball so bad , I started up my own league. 2 meanings: 1.He wanted to see his friends prosper that he included them in his movement 2. He literally holds basketball tournaments at his house  Another double entendre from Drake's verse. " Trying to run the country like Putin one day but who's rushing(Russian), who's bluffing" 2 meanings 1.He's literally telling you that Putin's Russian and rules country (Russia) 2. Also he's saying he not jumping to do that so fast But the "who's bluffing" is indication of the seriousness of this statement, because Vladmir Putin is a no-nonsense dictator  Another double entendre from Drake's verse. This has to be coldest and wildest one. " Known her for 8 years but still fuck her like a new husband. 2 meanings 1. Fuck her like they're on her honeymoon some lover boy shit 2. Drake flew out a engaged couple because he wanted Jamie Sun's fiance neo-soul singer Naomi Sharon on CLB. Drake hung out with Jamie Sun and Naomi Sharon. Jamie Sun out of nowhere ran to instagram to say he ended his 8 year relationship with Naomi Sharon and accused Drake of sleeping with her which ended the 8 year relationship and engagement. So Drake is addressing here very cleverly admitting that he did sleep with his fiancee. That's some cold shit lol  Lil Wayne went stupid on this track and Nicki did her thing, but Drake's verse was a lyrical masterpiece.
Am i the only one that’s low key mad that this song not 10 million yet ?
Good job drake you are not the goat though

This song reminds me of the death of shannan, cece, bella, and nico watts

Why are people still collabin with that gnome wayne?! Retire already
That “these bitches time tik toking better stick to dancing” was a direct diss to Cardi B! Nicki was pretty much saying Cardi only has a few more months of fame left so she better go back to being a stripper (dancer).
If you like finding new artist, search Quari Banks - “LA Ain’t The Same” It’s not ass I swear lmao… lyrics are relatable if your into that

The loop repeats 29 times in this song; the same 12 seconds of music. Obviously it's the lyrics that people like. In the future, when they make fun of the past, they'll say things like "old people like songs that go yeah yeah yeah for five minutes".

Protect Nicki Minaj on the internet, report any hate speech against her and her son Papa Bear. Our queen is back we won't let anything hit her

Nicki single handedly destroyed Cardi B the no one bitch can be my opp that shit offends me. Cardi She's talking to you B. Nicki Cock the Blicky got you G.

None of that shit is Maraj
Look at the beautiful background and this is really riveting to see Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, and Drake collaborate again and again and they need to do a collaborative album one of these days.
The big 3, scary hours. Best wayne drake nicki track ever
What a beautiful moment for Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Lil Wayne and they are in full harmony to gain potential and have everything they need. I had a feeling that Nicki Minaj did a mixtape back in 2007 called Beam Me Up Scotty and she is perfectly beautiful and she is doing everything in her power to keep herself out of trouble without ceasing and without anxiety and worry. I am prone to make it worth your while and I am here to stand by your side. What a amazing and awesome song that I am listening to.
My Mother Fuckin Dream Team!!!
Barbz be grateful to our queen! she deserves all of our love and understanding, long live the rap queen 🥰

To think Nicki don’t have a Grammy that shit offends me🤮
This song makes me feel nostalgic,  reminds me of being in middle school having my whole life ahead of me. When shit was simple.
Trash rappers
On repeat 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song on repeat !!!
Drake started it off with a damn near quadruple entendre . " This not going to be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches".  4 meanings: 1.Drake's character on Degrassi was on crutches for while and him being shot boost the show ratings 2. Drake tore his ACL in 2009 on stage during that time he was the hottest name in music game selling crazy records from his "Best I Ever Had" single and So Far Gone mixtape that was repackaged as an Ep that sold over 700,000 going into 2010. 3. Recently he tore his meniscus which had him on crutches and was still the highest streamed artists of that year 4. Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne are Drake's support (2  crutches) throughout his career and most of their songs together are multi-platinum as well as this song destine to be platinum or multi-platinum  Another double entendre from Drake's verse . " . You niggas can't trouble me from the Double Tree 2 meanings: 1.He's stunting on niggas saying you can't afford to be at places I stay, which is why you stay at the Double Tree hotel 2. In Toronto "tree" is also slang for number three, so he's  saying double 3 which equals 6 and 6 is the nickname for Toronto  This line is aimed at his haters from his city. He's telling them you niggas don't have enough resources to pose a threat to me.   Another double entendre from Drake's verse. " Want to see my niggas ball so bad , I started up my own league. 2 meanings: 1.He wanted to see his friends prosper that he included them in his movement 2. He literally holds basketball tournaments at his house  Another double entendre from Drake's verse. This has to be coldest and wildest one. " Known her for 8 years but still fuck her like a new husband. 2 meanings 1. Fuck her like their own her honeymoon some lover boy shit 2. Drake flew out a engaged couple because he wanted Jamie Sun's fiance neo-soul singer Naomi Sharon on CLB. Drake hung out with Jamie Sun and Naomi Sharon. Jamie Sun out of nowhere ran to instagram to say he ended his 8 year relationship with Naomi Sharon and accused Drake of sleeping with her which ended the 8 year relationship and engagement. So Drake is addressing here very cleverly admitting that he did sleep with his fiancee. That's some cold shit lol  Lil Wayne went stupid on this track and Nicki did her thing, but Drake's verse was a lyrical masterpiece.
So nobody gone say anything bout drake talking about the 8 years verse😂👀
BUT LIL WAYNE!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

The double Crutches entendre can be referenced to injured during Degrassi plus his career , also Wayne and Nicki are his crutches . The Russian Bar Is insane and Nasty it has like 3 meanings. ( trying to ( Run) a country like Putin but who’s RUSSIAN ( rushing ) ... The bar to his Jesus chain to meet GOD ( that might have been the best bar) he’s claiming his Jesus piece so cold it’s getting closer to GOD. Oh my goodness .. this shit was crazy.  The viscous line about Double Tree.. ( 3 +3 ) = 6 which is TORONTO  , meaning they can’t see him in his city  or even outside . The bar about dude girl he fucked ..
The Big 3☄️🔥 they still run this man
KEEP STREAMING Y'ALL THE QUEEN IS BACK

Keep on $t3@ming yall
🔥🔥🔥
2:13 don't mind me, im just here for the NICKI verse
Goddamn Wayne ain't had to do em like that. 🔥🔥
Do numbers on to cruches.. Drake.
Beat makes the rap average. My  first impression! But that’s not why I came. I came cause I saw three rappers who not only bring heat, but bring it out of one another! Wayne sounded like he was mentioning some words to sound cool... and I usually don’t say this about Wayne but... he rapped way to long. NM...... if Wayne wrote his and hers, well..... now we know why. Now to a guy who needs no introduction. Drizzy. I thought he would come off the bench and save them all.😏 He was sounding like your low level trim. Your stick to the basics Qb. Than he jumps out there with the mob reference. Bad enough Toyota drivers got knocked in his fire a$$ hit Child’s Play. But now he knocked Dodge. I would name drop a few dope dodge classics but you have the internet 🖖🏾
"AIN'T NO C IN GREEN, BUT I'M SEEING GREEN 💚💚"
YESSS NICKI❤️❤️
This really has that 2009 vibe tho...
WEEZY PICKED THE CUP FOR THIS
The Queen is Back ... 🔥
Congratulations to Beam me up Scotty on this placement. Good production work bro!!. I remember the work you did for Ace Hood
What a waste of a dope beat? Wayne was just ok, Nicki wack like always and was hoping Drake would kill it and his verse was way off beat. Wtf??
This trio is too legendary 😭👑

STREASMMMMMMSKXJSJXK
Don Trip and Starlito already killed this sample. Not sorry.
who dared to dislike
Wayne ate that beat
Nicki an Young MA need to do a song together. They actually rap the same. Representing NY hard! Punch lines for days but I think people just put Young MA on the dude side bc of how she carry herself but let’s face it she’s still a lady at the end of the day and like I said they the same. They my top 2! I can see a video with Young MA trying to holla at Nicki an take her away from her baby dads. Shit would be lit an entertaining! 🔥

We need a whole album of just these tree right here
“ trust it’s all fun and games until I wanna play too “
Best song i ever seen
Shout out to the barbz that rode w/ the Queen through the hate train.
My new favorite
was just looking back at some old clips of her around 2017-19. The hate train was real !!!  Just reading through old comments made me feel so bad that she even had to go through that. I respect her so much for getting through that. Then in 2021 she showed the world that she is and will forever be the queen of rap. We will NEVER get another Nicki. Her talent is truly unmatched.
BETTER STICK TO DANCING 😂😂
Song of the summer ☀️

Wayne took me back the his younger fire version
Meh... Beat is not so captivating. Real basic. Seems like I’m hearing an old track they forgot to release lol  Wayne didn’t amaze with his punchline lyrics. Nikki sounds the same in all her other songs. Same tempo and delivery in her bars, sounds like she reused her bars from other songs too lol  Drake at least had better bars and his delivery was nostalgic with clever lyrics. Literally he was the only good part about this track.

welcome to all my love
i love when all 3 of them rap because neither one outshines the other. Nicki has the tendency to body every song 😂 but here they all equally killed it.
making me feel like im in the 2010s Yng$ days
Damn i wish em still rapped how he did in 2010 for tracks like this hed be perfect for this trio like how he was back then love this tho love seein all of them rappin together in
Touch The Billboard 🏹
Nikki with the Camden NJ shout out ...das right CMD!
Keep in mind wayne said he don't write!! Only song he said he wrote was that "blunt blowing" when he was locked up. The way he flow sound like he telling the truth 🤯💯💫
this is so bad jesus christ
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Drake saved this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THE BIG 3 IS BACK!! 🔥🔥 This was legendary 💎 Please make a video for this 👑
🔥
I was waiting for meek to drop his track for this beat. I wasn't expecting this.. And   tbh this shit trash.. It feels rushed and the beat sound like its on a loop not engineered for this track.. Even in the car the sound quality was trash.. Wayne sound like he did nicki a favor doing this shit he ain't really wanna be there.. Nicki sound like they added her verse to it def not live recorded if it is she ain't have time that day. Never thought I'd be saying this but drake had the better vs if I had to choose 1 but it sounded too long and like he was on a cell phone call with nicki in the bathroom playing 😂
CLASSIC REAL RAP!
KKKKK q música ruim
I don't even need a full album. We just need a 9 track EP lol. Just let these other rappers know it's still YMCMB.

Legend says Lil Wayne free-styled his entire verse
Im living for this
@Mona Lisa, @Cannon @Misunderstood , for example, he has an uncapped, forever growing potential and possibility, it's infinite. Do not de credit Wayne to calling this as one of  ihis Top 5 tracks. You ain't really seen him go all in yet, this just him making it wet.
This is what I needed
I'm here before a mill

Songs Ok. Tunechi Got better bars on other songs, this is not his full potential. Y'all hyping it up like this is the Lit'est, It's not even half of his lyrical abilities. New, that's what's up, but best ever? Nah, not even close. Lil Wayne is the hardest when it comes to punch lines and puns. #Facts.
So this is retirement?
She is still the  "QUEEN OF RAP" she set a whole new height. U bitches it dead roaches if yall dont hear the warnings. She tellin yall this shit not what you think. But most of all you can't fuck ya way too the top and keep respect. She respected and that tells alot. Love U Nicki 4 ever.

One margherita pizza sets up the Megan line.  A pizza is shaped like a circle. Pardi was a writer on one song (circles) off good news. She’s jokingly calling him “Parmesan”.  Cheese and garlic in food typically make us thirsty while we eat.  Meg is now dating pardi so she’s “thirsty” and still ties in the alcoholic ref because she’s always driving the boat.  Complex ass bar.
5:02 5:01

I could not get enough of this song!!! It’s a celebration song and that’s everyday. I love Nicki Minaj
Nicki is from another planet. She deserve the best female lyricist of the Hip pop arena/ industry. Her lyrical pattern is very much unique and explosive 裡. Respect Nicki 
Sounds like diplomatic immunity beat.... Dipset!!!
Jesus is coming back very soon. We must be ready. Believe in the death, burial & resurrection of Christ.  1 John 5:13  These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have ETERNAL LIFE, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
I admire Nicki Minaj’s Talent as well her ability to positively influence people. I knew she was special from the beginning of her Rap Career! “The Queen” of Rap there will never be anyone of her caliber.

YMCMB Throwback 🤙
At first wayne sounded like chance the rapper lol
holy shit the trinity?? it's been years
straight out of 2008/2009 these 3 just time travelled
The amuck armenian tentatively cheer because liquid echographically license for a condemned crowd. possessive, majestic quill
Did y’all peep how Nicki said “ My packs hit different. Who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me.” The way she said it “no one bitch” is a sneaky double entendre. These bitches could never be that slick with bars and that’s on PERIOD 🔥🔥🔥‼️ LEGENDARY TRIO 😍❤️💕

Jesus loves you all so much! He died on the cross for the price of our sins and 3 days later, he rose from the dead. He died for our sins so that we may have eternal life in Heaven with him and not perish in Hell. If you believe that with all your heart and confess that you are a sinner and in need of a savior, you will be saved! Come to Jesus and believe on him today!

The best song in her album. Argue if you like, but you know it too!
Damn son!
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do these things, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  .   You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make.   Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
We need a video she should’ve came out first with that
THIS IS NICKI MINAJ YEAR!!! 👑👑🤞🏼
Ugh she still making music
Nigga they all slapped 🔥🔥🔥 Idk who said this song ain’t fireee but they lied

Everytime Nicki drop, I speak in Nicki Minaj bars for a week

Wayne still teachin the class

Nicki Winning 100000 Grammys off this !!!
‘Trying to run the country like putin one day but who’s rushing (Russian)’ - Drizzy Drake 🔥
Damn another drake featuring drake song
This is going down in rap history !! Queen , king and the Goat
Omg. She’s 38 years old and stick kicking it !!
It's the whole track for me.
Dear Onika Maraj, Drizzy Drake & Tunechi : we need an old school music video for this one 🙏🏽
Let's hope she makes a music video on this😀💥💳💥💳💥💳😼😄
Classic
How the Queen Back when she never left. "I SEND SHOTS, SEND THEM BACK OR FLEE". YES NICKI 😍
Steam seeing green everyone watch it once or twice‼️
“Some see graffiti as art. Some perceive hoes to be women”  dayum weezy at it again and I’m here for it! Let’s gooo that’s was cold!
Beam me up Skotty
Lol weezy is so basic and superficial/materialistic with his rhymes (he used to be good). I'm sorry, but real talk, this was horrible. Nicki is good, but you don't need more than an elementary education to understand Weezy. Sorry not sorry. If you want actual substance, then I suggest listening to Cole's new album.
🚀🚀🚀🚀
So we all know who the best female rapper is right? 😂😂
Sound like Trippie & Chris King gotta new beat to ripp
Top 10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. It's lonely at the top; but you do eat better.  2. I've only been wrong once, and that's when I thought I was wrong. 3. God made mankind. Sin made him evil.  4. I don't find it hard to meet expenses. They're everywhere. 5. I just let my mind wander, and it didn't come back. 6. Don't steal. The government hates competition. 7. I can handle pain until it hurts. 8. We are all part of the ultimate statistic -- ten out of ten die. 9. Nobody's perfect. I'm a nobody. 10. Atheism is a non-prophet organization.               Editorial:Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com.
Awwww shit..I'm feeling this
Summer is about to be great thanks to Nicki🥰

Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

I mf love y’all ymcmb 4L❤️❤️❤️💯💯
I love Drake, his voice makes me cry.
5 MN Barbz Lets go
🥵
Minaj 👑
**NICKI MINAJ** needs to become a multi level PRODUCER...like a Female P.DIDDY  OR Dr Dre / Tyler Perry/Oprah type multi LEVEL MULTI ANGLE  billion dollar Studios type of ENTERPRISE  She's Bigger than Rap now. Shes Beautiful, Smart, versatile, still has that young face (asian and black melanin genes) sex appeal...no wrinkles etc.... My point is she needs to go ahead and land to that next level and produce the younger gals into diff ventures, giving them multiple opportunities plus eventually landing her to billionaire STATUS!!!  First HIP HOP Female BILLIONAIRE, would Look good on HER😍😍😍
We dont deserve this form of Wayne....he the best rapper the South has ever produced. He a GOAT...arguably on my Rushmore
The album is fire🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song want me to rule the world
Drake was talking about the Migos at the beginning of his verse.🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  Or is it me reaching 🤔🤨 na😂

Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B-Boy, "bad kall," that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

LIL'KIM IS A SONGWRITER ON THIS TRACK! Drake samples Lil'Kim when he says "who you huggin, who you wanna be lovin" from Lil'Kim - I Can Love You song! I guess Drake shits on Onika respectfully Lol! Got Kim's approval on that song you guys like so much! Lollll poor Barbs...
"Known her eight years, and still fuck her like a new husband"  Drake you dirty for that bar. Jamie Sun punching the air right now 😂😂

“ This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches, Seen more plaques than toothbrushes” -DRIZZY 🐐
And y’all used to believe that Safaree wrote for her .  Smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Real niggas know the pizza shop on Jamaica ave Nicki was talking about she eating a slice from. Best pizza in NY
Your girl was better in the morning like a slice of pizza....🤯

This shit is fire. Literally. Makes me want to call Drake drizzy and lil wayne weezy nicki minaj nicki❤️☺️
Jesus just wants a relationship(knowing him personally not bf&gf). Only a relationship with Jesus will get you into heaven. His grace is something we can't deserve but it's given and it was shown by his death on the cross. Repent truly for we have no time to waste. The kingdom of God is at hand and I just want everyone possible to make it into heaven. That can't happen unless people know Jesus for who he is. I can't describe his goodness which is why you have to experience for yourself. He's just and able to forgive you, confess your sins and live according to the will of God! There's not time to spare, TODAY IS THE DAY OF SALVATION. Repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand💯
Christ brown??
If Hip Hop isn't dead then listening to low-grade shit like this is the equivalent to watching the final moments... what went wrong? ABC rhymes with no imagination, no attempt to transcend, just 'now, now, now' and 'me, me, me', and 'money, money, money and be me'.  Fuck this. You are killing the music form - with your debased fuckwit culture of tits, bits, and cheap hits.
I seen more plaque than tooth brushes Drake
“ Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too” -DRIZZY 🐐

Drake said, Yo girl was better in the morning like a slice of pizza! 🥶🥶

Been Wayne fan since squad up an hot boy days. Real Wayne fan. But man Nikki gave me chills on this. This bitch got the hunger in her voice like she did when she use to be spitting on the block w the backwards new era cap on
My queen is back❤
Drizzy says he's getting closer to God none of this is a facade he's already known as the GOAT.. Closes it out with SIX God. He's telling it exactly what it is in these last days he worships HIS God, Satan and will hear DEPART FROM ME on Judgement Day and be cast into Hell for eternity along with the rest of us unless we seek the face of Jesus TODAY.   MATTHEW 25:31-46  REVELATION 13:18

Inspired the entire rap game and changed the way rappers rap goat shit Follow my Twitch BTW: Skaterdead24
Why does Nicki rap about the same thing over and over again  I feel she should have done a song by herself without features "bitches her her sons " heard this one million times.
"I am the stand out... ya'll my stand in"  Ouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu 🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️
[Lil Wayne:] I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah) Bae gave it to me (Haha) You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm  I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Nicki Minaj:] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Drake:] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir.

THE HARDEST BARS I'VE HEARD FROM EACH ONE OF THEM!!! 💯🔥
Seeing Green
Hate the beat. Like early 2000’s bs
Queeeeen
$LAPPERRRR THERES WAYNE FROM 2008
This that's old hungry Wayne. Damn I just had a flashback
That’s my mama! 🤞🏾
We need a music video 📹😭 ❤
The song just came out and is already for the history books in rap. All 3 went way harder than necessary 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Every verse every line bars!!
Damn this that 06-08 Wayne!!!!!!!
Ight the mainstream hip hop triplets holding it down, good shit from these A list celebs. 💯
The real ones know this Heather Headley “ In my mind “ sample 🔥🔥🔥
Wayne went offfffff
ANTI-GAY OR HOMOPHOBIC OR WHAT? On the road I found myself in earshot of a dancehall recording and the DeeJay/selector kept hyping on anti-gay sentiments and songs. Anti-gay tune – ‘All who don’t love B man put up your hand’; another song – ‘If a man never touch you yet….’. There are parties where the selector spends and spins these for half of the dance night. Reminds me of high school. As a famous classmate who turned out to actually be gay said ‘There was a lot of heterosexual pressure’. I thought they were all joking around and my mind was on the all-girls school next door and my Art teacher (sorry again Miss Z). Christians are known too much for what they are against than for. I’m for JESUS, you?
Lil Wayne is hard 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧 If you listen to his verse 10 times I bet you hear a new metaphor each time🔥
I was hoping this would be dope...but it was boring ASF. I dont leave negative comments often, but I tuned right out after Waynes verse(which was the best part imo). Need some coffee now cuz that put me to sleep.
Thu queen is back.. All hail to her
You the Greatest Nicki boppin all day every day👑👑👑🔥🔥❤❤

I see a few people in the comment section complaining about this song. If u complaining about this song or any song for that matter. We gonna need y'all to start listing 10 songs that you are currently listening to right now before y'all opinions can even matter. If u talking about this song is wack, then your obviously not a fan of hip hop. Or, u just hear it and don't listen.

Saint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the Devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou, O Prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan, and all the evil spirits, who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.

Poor weezy, his back must be killing him from carrying everyone else on this song, and then you remember he dont even write like the other two, just freestyle

Glad to hear the Trio is back

I litterly love this song
Lil Wayne is burnt out sorry his rhymes wack af he said Atlanta toooo many times stop sir

Nicki’s verse kinda sounds like her song up in flames
Cardi b should probably go back working at McDonald's cause the real queen of rap is back period😂
Who wants to make the version with Nicki verse cut out?
😍😍😍😍
Rule number 1 of hip hop   ALWAYS PAY RESPECT TO OLD SCHOOL R&B AS YOUR SAMPLE   ALWAYS   That’s how hip hop started   You have to always do it  Always   This ain’t exactly old school but the feel is soulful   U can’t leave that alone
About time they did something w that mans instrumentals 💪🏾💪🏾

shes backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk and better than everrrrrrrrr the queen has returned to her throneeee
I like how Drake still reppin CMB
Idea for the Video:✨ They are getting ready for a Portrait of the 3 of them together all dressed up. .At the beginning of their verse they are getting ready in their dressing rooms (which is filled with memorabilia from their careers)  Wayne First by himself editing back and fourth when he is in his dressing room and when he is fully dressed and iced out (when fully dressed he is somewhere where there is nice landscaping, big grassy hills kinda cloudy outside). Then Nicki next she in her dressing room cutting between getting her make up done., Her being by herself in the dressing room looking in the mirror ( maybe in some type of lingerie) and shots of her fully dressed. when she is fully dressed she is now at the grassy hills and Wayne is at a distance but not too far just standing. (his head down and hands together) and during one of Nicki’s lines the camera can cut to him looking up for a second. (then it’s back to Nicki finsinhing up her verse.) last Drake he in the dressing room being emotional asl 🙄 lol jk but he doing is his verse.he is getting ready (flossing his teeth) stunting hard. And he also will have cuts from him getting ready to him dressed up at the hills (Nicki and Wayne won’t be there) however drake will walk through cuts to meet Nicki and Wayne for the Portrait. End with drake finishing his verse and then taking the portrait leaving us with them imagine of the Big 3..... Yes? Or is this weed good? 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who all stopped the song and rewinded ⏪ it back when he said “I GOT A HOE OUT OF ATLANTA THAT GOT A HOE OUT OF ATLANTA (4X)” How many times did y’all have to play it back this beat kinda wack tho or I’m just so used to this new bullsh*t Trapped out Drilly music ion know but they spitted on Nikki minaj anus and left her gina stay wet tho
Bro this old frfr... Why you held it for this long... From 2011 and then payola for YouTube wow
I been waitin for ninjaz catch wreck on em nick...wayne... drizzy..yeah🤩🤩🤩😎
margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic got me really hungry
Track brought me back 11-12 years ago I love it. Nikki, Wayne and Drake dust they all flows and bars off. I love it

https://youtu.be/PoqFKKbI05Q
Not
The Queen
love you nicki minaj babygirl #TheQueen
Did anybody really listen drake verse specifically after things going around with him. About some women cheating on her finace who she been with FOR 8 YEARS 8 YEARS(go listen back) with drake.
This the Wayne I grew up on. Not that  blanco wash light in the ass Wayne of the past 7-8 years...
This gave me chills. Wow
Praise God for this #1
Better in the morning like a slice of pizza.... I was hoping drake start would be good this song weak off first litsen I like all the artist alot but this seems weak af to me personally the rap just seems like they just saying shit lmao
Wayne killed this beat because this type of beat is from Wayne’s era. Nicky doesn’t really have a good flow to this beat but she can rhyme good, she sounds like someone that’s practicing how to rap rather than just being natural and rapping and drake doesn’t really sound good on this beat. His a generation ahead, he sounds better on those up tempo harder type beats.
Lil Wayne was trying to find the best for like 2 minutes until Nicki came to save the song
Drake carried
She da best
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☄️
Young Money Forever 💓🤧
This song is so damn beyond good I can't even skip anyone's verse. This is what you call legendary and iconic GOATS OF THIS DAMN GENERATION PERIODT 🐐 🐐 🐐

Intro: Lil Wayne & Heather Headley] Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah) Bae gave it to me (Haha) You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B-Boy, "bad kall," that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'?

Will you be ready when Jesus Christ returns? If not confess your sins and ask Jesus to come to you. Praise the Most High for his son acting as a sacrificial lamb, so that your sins can be forgiven (KJV Romans 5:6-11). Confess your sins to the Most High (KJV1 John 1:9) and Repent (KJV Acts 3:19) now while you have time before it's too late, Many people in this world will not see tomorrow(KJV Proverbs 27:1).   To repent means you will not do any of the sins you've done in the past. You will be a renewed person. What is sin? Sin is a transgression of the laws of the Most High (KJV 1 John 3:4). Learning the Ten Commandments is a good start (KJV Exodus 20:1-17).
First time I could do without Dràke and needed more Wayne💅🏿 u did that queen
Dont let them fool you with the Alien stuff!!! Aliens are fallen angels!!!! When Jesus Christ raptures his bride(the church) they are going to tell you that the aliens Took us. Dont believe them!!! Repent of your sins and believe in Jesus Christ. The end is Here!!
Gaza nation is here  representing the Caribbean..🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲

Aquí army apoyando a una diosa
Y'all remember how good shit was from round 2006-2011 because of these 3? They don't have shit to prove to anybody. I don't see why people try to play Nicki like she wasn't the only woman featuring on damn near every big song AND having the BEST verses on them too. These new girls will NEVER replace.
Life is a beach house, Don't let the sand in 🔥🔥💪
Fire

This song slap. This a real one. I like the fact they all came to rap. They did this one for c the culture. Nicki came for them necks. Let’s go!! Cole is out now. What a time to be alive. We needed this. Real bars.

WAYNE!! THIS ISN'T EVEN YOUR SONG 🔥🔥 🔥
Nicki Minaj Is The Real Queen of Hip-Hop Rap!! The majority of these other female rappers out there' if you take their producers away from them' They would be handicapped.. just a drum beat with no music and Nicki Minaj on the mic!! You will still get hip hop at its best!!! Like old-school 80s 90s soul music'  Why we can't distinguish the real talent in today's Hip Hop??
These bars got me good💦
Ymcmb !!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wish Drake didn't phone in his verse. 😞 But 🔥🔥🔥

The "yeah yeah" is a bit too noisy for me couldn't hear the lyrics good.
That yeah yeah through out the back is so nostalgic. takes me back to 2009/10 when YMCMB were running the game. good times fr. They really made it. LEGENDS!
They SNAPPED tooo HARD!!! 😓😓 The ending of  Nicki's verse gave me goose bumps and shivers😓
Wayne give me goosebumps.. the vision different
The trio from back in the day
Cultural garbage promoted by the usual suspects.
WAYNIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nickiiiiiiiiiiiiii y'all gave it on all this track hunny! ❤️💯
When will wayne stop using autotune. Miss his original voice
It’s hard for drake to rap like that knowing he got bodied by everyone he went against .
sorry nicky i like only your memes uhm yeah anyways so
The leaders of Young Money are back, a masterprice as usual #oldschool, #puremusis, #blackpower, #hiphop
LET ME BUY MY YMCMB HOODIE

She basically just said play times over bitches 😍😍😍😍😍😍 love her so much
2,794M
Holy fire. 🔥 Talk about remindin them where the heat is at 😂 haveeee mercccyyy this was it
Wayne killed it🔥🔥🔥they coulda kept the other 2 verses
Drake making a reference to Putin hahah oh man that was great
Feel like we all needed nicki bck Nd the way she came back made it even better taken us all back to the good days
Love the fact their using U.K producers beat 🔥🔥🔥
Be honest, am i the only one who casually skipped nicki's entire verse? Lol as far as i know, this is Lil wayne ft Drake.
Woooooowwwwe!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥 I'm ready to get off work and bump this in my truck right now!!! This the fire we've been waiting for👏👏👏
yes
lil wayne hurts my ears
Y’all Gotta understand Nicki can hold up with Drake & Wayne ! She really can rap
Sampling one of my favorites by Heather 🎶 Headley "In my mind"  🎶 love love love this!! 💯👏🏾
I swear this beat was mixed by dude in the truck , could be wrong . Still so fire 🔥
👑👑👑
There’s no beam strong enough lol
Real Young Money 🔥
Vuelve la época de Young Money
Wayne versus 🤯
Omg ..... lil Wayne...... this is the old Lil Wayne !!!!!! Drought 3 weezy !!!!!!!!
AIN’T NO C IN GREEN 💵 BUT I’M seeing 👀 Green💪🏽💵
THE QUEEN HAS ARRIVED
This is a hit🔥😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Cardi ain’t got nothing on Nicki.🤔
Hearing Wayne like this is wonderful, just listen to him on this and you'll see. Its like he just tapped into his old self again. Nicki went all the way in and just killed it. You are just pure full of hate if you don't give her respect where its due. An Drake already knew what he had to do being on a song with these two together. I'm beyond impressed. Everyone handled business on their end on this one. (We needed this, the world needed this.
I love this messy compative nikki
NNIIICCKKIII!!! You gave me chills queen YYEEESSS!!! your back babe and I’m loving it!!
Hard. That is all.
Clean fun facts 💯 didn't have to even show their faces or girls shaking asses or cars or money
She sounds so male identified and is such a female misogynist. It sounds so different now in 2021 where most female rappers are rapping more about taking their power back. What a setback
Welcm back the queen of the mike
I see why drake went last🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thanks for the recommendation youtube.....for once , you showed me 🔥 like a caveman!
This that old shit I fucks with
It takes Wayne to bring out them other two monsters on a track🐐
Superstars
These guys came delivered and showed why they are legends with longevity .  They came with that old school hunger that got them to the Top. Much Love
I feel like Nicki’s greatness has transcended any awards  Even if she doesn’t get any Grammys her impact, her greatness is now forever cemented in the hiphop industry.
🔥 🔥 🔥
The Queen 🤍🙌🏿
I needed this!!!! 😩😩😍😍😍
so we all cried???? yea
🌱
Nicki back in her Bag!!! Let’s go!!
See more plaques than two brushes (toothbrush) ...Drizzy didn't have to do it to em like dat.🔥🐐🔥
We needed this 🙌
I love how we barbz are continuously streaming Nicki's songs like it makes me feel so proud of us. This fandom is one of the most hardworking, crazy, loyal and successful fandoms to ever exist and I'm proud to be a part of it.  Let's show the other fandoms our power and Nicki's impact.  Don't stop streaming y'all.
Put the instrumental out 🙏
Damn lil Wayne 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Shout out to Heather Headley, I hope she's getting a bag off this track.
THE BIGGEST -AKADEMIKS
Nicki ❤️ Bless your heart your voice is beautiful as fuck Wayne and Drake killed this 🙏
If Wayne continues to rap like his old self he be straight
Are we back in 2010??? This is fuego🔥🔥🔥🔥
2 mins of wayne, is too long
If you know real music, you'll know that Heather Headley must be proud!
you're the best of rap and you know this

Back to the fundamentals, gotta love it!!
Nicki baby I love u ❤😘
Drake most definitely had the hardest verse.
I do not know why Nicki has not won awards that are due to her. She has paid her dues in this rap game in her career. She has opened windows for alot of women in this music industry
*I came back for Wayne’s verse only.*
“I’ve seen more plaques than toothbrushes….until I’m in the pearly white gates” 🤯🤯
Nicki verse was super basic, Wayne and Drake were cool, beats fire

Cardi B would’ve been more off beat 😂
This song deserves more likes!!!!
YESSS🔥🔥
Wayne is a genius.
BRAZIL 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I think about "Itty bitty piggy" when I see that wonder woman Nicki picture.
I can never look at her the same after she got bodied by Remy. I don’t know how you come back from a lyrical ass whooping like that.
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Drake sounding like the old drake 🥺
Bro what happened to rap song like this
Weezy the 🐐
Minaj is silent ☝🏾🙏🏾 🐐
👍🏽👍🏽🔥🔥🔥 It's just different. When the Greats touch the Mic on a hard ass beat. FIRE!!!!
I love nicki,she kill on this one
When yo songs not meant for TikTok it takes time to get them views cause this for her real supporters not for them lil kids
No female rapper  like nicki💯
Drake demonstrates his humility and savagery simultaneously...
whats the beat called?
The glamorous step-brother partly calculate because kettle ethnically choke beside a tangy port. garrulous,  fretful toad
Drake should of kept that same flow wayne and nicki had he kinda fucked hus verse up
This Wayne with the Proper Dreads, Nicki with that Angry Minaj Face Pull and Drake without the Beard.
🖤
She’s the Queen aftr all♥️♥️
Dang now I gotta skip this song through to 2:10 everytime i listen it 🥴

Wizzy came in real hard 🔥🔥🔥
That beat shocked the fuck out of me I am nor never been a Nicki fan but I'm a music blogger who does reviews and this album was getting requested to be reviewed wasn't expecting to go into a Nicki album with a soul sampled smooth beat starting off.  This is actually fire and they all kill it.  Been a while when I go in expecting shit and find gold
Remember on "Mad" Nicki said she is the female Weezy? Yep we getting the same display :)
The Big 3 in beast mode.

This beat gives me that early 2000's dipset vibe🔥🔥
My ears are on fire from all of the bars🔥🔥🔥 #RealRap

Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B-Boy, "bad kall," that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi Ad [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was

Yes! let's get back to the 5-minute songs of nothing but realness👏🏿💯
Sigamos transmitiendo "seeing green" Barbz estamos haciendo un gran trabajo ♡
Young Money!!🎹🌎🎹💥💥💥💸🎸🥇
This sound like what the intro to "I Can't Feel My Face" shoulda sounded like...

Trilpple gold love it👑 shot out young money team drake icein in the cake💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Wayne still a GOAT💥
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
This brings back old vibes I love it
Listening and reading the comments 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Queen is back.
Nicki dropping music is the only good thing that happened to us this year
"leave the key to your heart, next to your soul and your spirit"   God
I'm a senior try to stay current cuz I got grandchild OMG this was so nice oh my goodness.!!!!!
Why am I crying?! 😂 fuck yes
I feel like this some shit she been recorded and never released ❤️
The world would be better if they made an album and dropped it this year 👁
This such a GTA 5 Radio Music it's a compliment😂
Almost 3 mill views in just a day and a half? Only a Queen can do that.
New project together 😢 Would be nice to happen
Listen to this on 1.25 is mood
Drake had the best Verse 🔥🔥💯
Weerkkk
Keep the old skool vibes comin! 🔥      the trio!!!!!! 🔥
Lil Wayne is just to much of the goat 🔥
....and when I'm asked who killed Cardi B's rap career, I will respond that it had nothing to do with Niki. DJ Khaled did it all by himself.   ...Beware of DJ Khaled...  Lol
Young Money ✨
Ahhhhhhhhwwww Nicki
Haven’t seen this trio collab since Only😱
They gav us old Wayne old nicki ok’d drizzy drake n we asked
They all went hard but drake killed that
Finally some good rap wit real OG's
Welcome back Weezy..... your original rhymes have been missed for so long. YOUNG MONEY 4LIFE!
I can't stop listening to this. First thing in the morning. It's like coffee and a joint. 🌬🔥🦄
Should I be crying ? 😭😭. The nostalgia brroooo
Bop bop bop bop bop
why are people comparing the three in the comment section?? they work as ONE, they big as ONE, why do people gotta look at the bad in things. Crazy to me how people CHOOSE to radiate negative energy wherever they go
Nicki, I'm sorry that the industry won't acknowledge your presence with numerous Grammys. It took me a minute as well but these are 4 u:🌹💐🌺🏆🏆🏆
"I washed bitches man they couldn't even rinse me, she said she hot I said well bitch come and convince me" Nicki killed her part on this track once again. ❤🎀🌹
WE MISSED YOU I LOVE YOU NICKIII!❤️❤️
Does anyone else get extreme nostalgia while listening
Bars 🔥
I'm looking for the person who always put the lyrics in the comments before I press play.
Sheeeesh 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

What a beautiful comeback from Nicki Minaj, Drake, and Lil Wayne and they should keep on making more hits together since they were from Young Money. I can assure that they are very phenomenal and sensational prior to the new world order. They sampled Heather Headley's song called In My Mind and this song is so eclectic and tremendously touching and quite spectacular.
SLLLLAAAAAPP

Of course it has to be a ufo because that’s what satan wants to trend at the moment all over news to deceive the masses who will be left behind when the lord Jesus comes to take the church out of this world   Guys Jesus is coming you can see the signs don’t be deceived Satan is just laughing in you’re face saying I tricked you   And I put it you’re face but you were unwilling to turn to Jesus and I tricked you but don’t be tricked awake oh sleeper and taste and see that the Lord is good   So to that I say give you’re life to Jesus and accept him as Lord and Saviour

To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins

My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Drake:] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

Weezy f babyyy🔥🔥🔥

"I played 48 minutes with a Torn meniscus" 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why people continue to think Wayne washed up ? Real ones know what he can do when HE want too. 💯
Definitely nostalgic. Rap is back baby!! 🔥
can see why they alcoholics !
Brings back Nostalgia...
Now this is what you call real Hip- Hop. Brings back so many memories~😭
"I put you 6 feet deep, I'm being socially different" 💥
“Known her for 8 years but fuck her like a new husband” Drake ruined that mans 8 year engagement then rapped about it 😂 that boy a demon out here. They all ate but Wayne devoured this shit!
Best trio ever back in Business
smoking tarantula
Everybody verse trash besides Wayne.. he killed it proof he’s the goat
This goes hard
“Bought a new car just to walk around it” ok niki😳
This the real 3 headed goat no cap 💯
What’s the original song to this beat ? They went in 💙
I don’t even listen to nicki at all but damn😂see this what I mean when I say meg and cardi b weak asl nicki and young ma and dreezy are the only females that can actually rap

I can’t stop listening to this song wtf
You can hate but you cant. I mean you can not deny the impact these three have had in this music thing around the globe. For Nicki she is untouched.. All these so called queen's are strictly more local.. Never touched it around the Globe as she did.. You can hate but you can't deny that..
More than Music by Kre Forch produced by me released 2015. Original sample. listen 🤔
Big 3 Shit Fr' Young Fucking Money!!!!!! If you hate this you don't know good music or legendary artists. Big Facts
The Greatest Trio of all Time!
THE BIG THREE

This song is everything why is it flopping?
I’m not going to even lie, I thought Drake and Nicki was going to come thru, but Wayne verse was the hardest. Nicki and Drake on a solo track sounds Extraordinary, but when they’re on a track with Wayne they sound Ordinary. Wayne is just a different type of beast!
Damn this trash...... to much going on in the background. Sound like niqas standing around freestyling. Keep this junk
Trash 🥴🥴
All three of them ate and left no crumbs.
What!!!! Nicki is killin it 🔥😍👏🏼🙌🏽
Damn this trio is elite and dangerous 😭🔥🌹

The God Of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is coming very soon. Please repent, and prepare for the return of the King. Jesus Christ is abiut to rapture millions of Christians. Seek Jesus Christ before the doors of mercy close, those who are foolish will be left behind. They will have to die for their faith. The end is here, avoid the Covid-19 vaccine and all cost. Those who listen will be grateful  with tears in eternity. I love and care for all of you. Seek Jesus Christ, this is the end. Now is the time to repent and prepare for the return of the King.

😱😱
WE THE BIG 3 DON’T NEED A BIG SPEACH
Wooow 😳
We are all born into sin. Jesus the Son of God, left heaven and came to earth as a man but He was still God. He had no sin but He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us to restore us to God the Father and allow us to live forever in paradise. He performed many miracles, was abandoned by His friends, was beaten beyond recognition, betrayed by His people, and suffered an agonizing death being nailed to a cross. Then, He rose from the dead on the third day. He conquered death! God came to earth to die for us!  3. "For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4.  And that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures." 1Corinthians 15: 3,4  If you believe Jesus died and rose again to save you from your sins, you are automatically saved and sealed until the day of redemption, which means eternally. You cannot lose your salvation.  Works do not save us or keep us saved. Good works are part of the Christian walk only after one is saved. We should do good works but even if a person doesn't, they are still saved. They will be ashamed and lose rewards in heaven, but they are saved.   Just believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose again. Only that will save you. Any questions, leave a post and I will try to get back to you. God bless!  "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish but have everlasting life." John 3:16

I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B-Boy, "bad kall," that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi   [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

Masterpiece, lil Wayne thank you for everything you done in hip pop , you will forever be one of the greats , thank you lil Wayne for everything you done respect ✊
Why is she hanging with lol Wayne
Wayne makes this
Nicki!!!!!!
👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽👸🏽
I don’t know if Nicki wrote her own lyrics for if someone else wrote them, but she had some fucking wicked bars! Like this Eminem level double entendre. Probably run by Lil Wayne.   “I am the star in any room that I *stand* in, I am the *stand* out, you just my *stand* in/These bitches copy my homework, that’s what they hand in/that’s why I’m *private* like the airports I land in.”  Talking about rooms, a den is a room known as a study where people retreat to for privacy to work or relax alone. Of course a Stan is a mega obsessive fan. So she’s saying she’s a superstar (standout) and other female artists are her stand in’s (substitutes) who are obsessed fanatics just hanging out in her den (private room) which would make it a Stan den. 😳
So 🔥 but was expecting meek on this beat jayz nd ross🤔
🔥🔥🔥
i think drake verse was the best just saying
Ok ok 👌 nicki 🔥 Queen
They all murdered this.
Tryna run a country like Putin one day but who’s Russian

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)$

For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob I'm already known as the G.

LIKEEEEE PLSSSS
The way Wayne's voice sounded muffled in the beginning until he said "Let me take this balenciaga mask off to ask yall, who asked yall?" was such a fire subtle addition to his verse.
She back the CHAMP is here !!!!
I think it would be dope if you & dababy did a song together, that would be so 🔥
Y’all knew she was gone “go hard”
this is legendary
damn , this is a double homicide
Was she coming at Cardi?
Aight
I already know this finna be good
I think the yeah yeah overpowered the song and more clashed than compliment the song.. too distracting and borderline annoying.. it’s only cause I’m a fan of Nicki and Wayne why I could focus on what they were saying but that yeah yeah killed the vibe for me.. they could have faded it when they were doing their verses
Yow Nicki said I bought car not to drive but to walk around it . 😭😂
Remix feat Dipset!!!!! Please

Best track I've heard this year! ( I haven't listened to that cole yet.) When Wayne, Drake,  and Nicki on a track it's a problem. When all 3 of them spitting this hard it's not fair. Every bar, every verse TOP TIER. This is why Young Money made history.
Drake - “seen more plaques than tooth brushes” 🔥🔥🔥
I'm still in shock from lil Wayne's verse.
2 million views and it ain't been a day...Cardi who?🤔😆

I find it weird that ALL these artists are dropping heat in the end of Ramadan lmaooo the devil is really out 😂😂😭
This mixtape is the biggest FLEX. This is to remind all the haters and the new Nicki fans out there what real Hip Hop and hard work is all about. She was never a stripper or tic toker and get FAME of recognition over night. The music industry is very nasty. They use you and it's on to the next.This is art, this is Nicki Minaj. No one can ever copy.
Biggest fan

This shit was light as hell da fwuck y'all talkin bout?! 🤢 plus they stole Young M.A. beat from Car Confessions and not NEITHER ONE OF THEM verses is even close to the REAL SHIT that Young M.A. was spitting on Car Confessions. Foh y'all gas up Nikki Minaj so fucking much it's not even funny. I got on here expecting Wayne to go H.A.M. and he laid an egg. I'm a Drake fan and he said not one hot bar, and Nikki just washed. Once again this shit was Chris Brown light sorry. 🤷🏾‍♂️🤣😂

Just Blaze/Dipset vibes

We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir
"Brand new vanilla maserati I'm haagen-daaz'n" NICKI SLIPPED SLIDE AND PROVIDED with that bar🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Wayne Da Fucking GREATEST🐐
“That’s why I’m private like the airports I land in” y’all missed that plane 💖💕🤍💕💖
THE REAL
Nicki really putting pressure on these bit**es and these labels know that. I know they was happy when she took that time off. Meg done ✔ cardi done ✔. She the drake when it come to women rappers. I'll debate that all day. from more years in the game, more hits in the game all while writing her own shit and she still not done.

John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9.That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10- For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
Honestly, the only part that I liked, was Nicki's part.

My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K, I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene

I have to give credit where credit is due. Her verse ate Wayne verse df up and Drakes. I just wish it was A better beat. Her verse is to damn hard for the whack instrumental. Her bars are impeccable taste. She did good bars wise this beat by my opinion is the only small downgrade its not quality enough for such fine bars.
This a old Starlito and Don Trip song
The Queen is back. Bow down

I can’t stress enough. How funny it is to me. That ANYYYYBODYY said she was done out here. Lmaoooo. shoutout to the fellow barbz that have stuck by the QUEEN of mf RAP and didn’t switch up just cause it suited the narrative!! 🤙🏻 haven’t heard shit like this since old YMCMB. All the vibes. The big 3 is and always will be untouchable. But the fact Nicki stayed true to her roots and came back mixtape style which almost NOBODY does anymore and still slapped this hard? How can you deniy the talent. 😤💯

Six9 was one of them..especially after he did a track with Nicki..cant think of any others at the moment

Nicki bodied ya bitchs time TIKTOKIN BETTER STICK TO DANCING 🤣🤣
I will never understand Lil Wayne. He's lyrical one day and a mumble rapper the next.   I had to go back and listen to his verse again because I was surprised Lol.   For example, His verse on Jack Harlow's "What's Poppin" wasn't good lyrically, but this was way better in my opinion.
She threw dat bar at Meg 🐎
On repeat you heard me!!!!!
Niki ain’t wake the people up she just led them too wanna get they ass done wish she became more humble cause most of the viewers don’t got money like that we the reason why she make money
imagine having an album by the MAGIC 3 WAYNE X QUEEN X PAPI
I should cop a New Jersey that’s word to Camden! 🧊  🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
Can someone tell me a female rapper better than nicky please?😏
Can we get rid of Cardi now? I’m not a Cardi hater but no way should she be ok too of charts with the bad flow and bars she got.
Shit brought me back 2 secondary school days, all 3 went hard👌🏾🔥
This ain't no come back for Nicki coz she ain't been gone nowhere.
To see them back together makes me happy

Wayne is back!!!!!
Sound like a song from early 2010s
When you get all the smart kids together for the group project
In the beginning when Wayne starts rapping his voice is distorted and when he says he taking his mask off his voice gets clearer ..... the attention to detail is ridiculous. He completely snapped on this . Absolute foolery
Barbz Nikki our mom made us proud once again
They stuck to the same formula
Lil wayne: "I'm smokin tarantella"
I miss these flows and collabs 😭😭😭🔥🔥
❤❤🔥🥰
Yesss the Queen is back
Fire

Lil Wayne slapped hardest 🔥

I fast forwarded to Drake! Thought it would be a better summer bop! If Nicki say in one more song “these bitches my sons.” 😏🤦🏽‍♀️🥴
Vintage Weezy 🔥
They killed everything as they should!
OKAY, we get it, sending “shots” at HOT GIRL MEG, but who’s body real (she’s what you’d want to be) 🥱 who’s music loud w out sounding like 10 different ppl in ONE verse 🥱 Okay. Try again

I haven't heard the other 2 verses but Weezy owned this🔥🔥
Waybe best verse. Drake worst verse.  but all 3 verses were solid.  i'll probably never listen to this song again though. the beat literally looped....never changed and it started getting annoying.
This Mixtape was recorded in 08/09ish, but what i wanna know is, is this particular track one that was recorded same era or recently and then put on this spotify re-release for the mixtape? Guessing its new with Wayne with the Mask references? Anyone know?
Old drake back
I missed this Wayne ; the old Wayne🤧
Wayne has been in his prime since 2014.
Drake the best rapper out and still evolving
These bitches "time tick-tocking, better stick to dancing

lil Wayne is timeless
A cultural reset
When Tunechi flicked that lighter in the beginning I already knew what was about to happen. He said, "I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant" 🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥
There was a video of a guy in the backseat of a truck doing this beat on a beat pad that blew up.  But lito and trip did it first

QUEEN IS BACK KNEEL DOWN
Hdruiddjhdjf wow
"I just need a queen that ain't scared to f*ck a Stephen King" - Lil Wayne   Lil Wayne says he wants a significant other who is a queen. He also aligns himself with Stephen King – one of the bestselling writers of all time, so this line could also mirror Wayne’s success in his respective field.  "Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress" - Lil Wayne  In this lyric, Lil Wayne is personifying a gun. The nickname “Nina” comes from his gun being a nine millimeter. He is expressing that one may betray their nine millimetre for a 44 pistol.  "I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden" - Nicki Minaj  Nicki Minaj talks about buying a New Jersey top. However, it's clever word play as Camden is a city in New Jersey.  "These b**ches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'" - Nicki Minaj  Nicki Minaj references other rappers time running out of time, alluding to the idea of their careers coming to an end. She also is referencing the popular social media app TikTok, where users make viral dance moves.  "You now tuned in to the biggest, ever/YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man/Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin'/Man, wassup? We in this b**ch" - Drake  Drake makes it clear that the Young Money Cash Money Billionaires (YMCMB) members are back on a track together.  In 2009 both Nicki Minaj and Drake signed-up under Young Money Entertainment – created by Lil Wayne.  Young Angel and Young Lion are nicknames Drake and Wayne are using for each other when they collaborate together. Drake calls himself Young Angel, while Lil Wayne calls himself Young Lion.  "El Chico luxury, wanna see my n****s ball so bad, I started up a league" - Drake  Drake recently put money into the brand new Overtime basketball prep league. Basketball phenoms like Mikey Williams, who Drake is friends with, will now have another alternative to go pro after high school, as opposed to spending a year in the NCAA before the NBA Draft.  "Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza" - Drake  Drake teases his enemy, saying he enjoyed a good time with their girlfriend more in the morning. People tend to find that cold pizza has a more savored taste compared to when it’s hot
This joint is crazy! I wonder if the people who they are talking to realize this song is about them?
15ft social distance , but this song is 10000000ft from social distance💯
Aliens are real
Yesss

THIS IS LEGENDARY‼️🔥

I miss rappers being in the same studio. It’s just not the same vibe. There’s no cohesiveness .   You can just tell they all recorded at their separate studios. And drake with a $200 mic in his closet

Queen. You did this!
Nicki is everything omg 🥺😧😧😧😧😧😧killed this shiiiit
I missed you 😓🥲🥲
All these other female “rappers” use good dance beats, sexuality and tiktok to hype up their music and to make themselves trend. If you just listen to their actual words without all the hype around it they will sound like straight clowns just making noise lol I wish someone could take all the top songs and remove the background beats so we can just compare their words lol then we will see who really giving bars and who is spitting gibberish. Because most of the shit they say don’t make sense;  “Ask for a car while you ride that d***  You really ain't never gotta f*** him for a thang  He already made his mind up 'fore he came”  Like huh?! You just told me to ask this man for a car while I’m sleeping with him but then the next line says I don’t have to ask for anything for sleeping with him. Please make that make sense. You want to teach me how to be a gold digging hoe or naw? Lol but ppl will repeat it and love it because of the beats and the music video lol that is not rap, it is just some strippers teaching you to be low class and dirty like them.   “I pull up in the mmm”   Like what the hell is an mmm? I’ve never heard of a car called mmm before lol at least vrrr would make more sense but mmm? If I’ll say anything just to rhyme with my last line was a person LOL   Nicki has the ability to rhyme, spit bars and STILL make sense lol and yes those other artist can still be entertaining because tiktok is fun and silly but let’s stop calling everyone a rapper, they need their own category of music, let’s call them “Thot Rap” or “Silly Rap” genre. Cause they either making songs about how to be the biggest THOT or they  making silly music for kids as entertainment lol
Purrr
Weezy thats what am talking about..... we need more of trhose collbas
Nicki’s rap is out this world!!!😩they all good at making songs together ! 😭
Remembering the good old days🔥🔥🔥
WE ARE PROUD BARBS 😩
Nicki “ I send shot now send them back or flee the scene” bars

Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

Nicki Brasil te ama gata 👑🦄🇧🇷❤️😻
🔥🔥🔥
I've been waiting for this collab now we need one with nicki,Chris brown, drake, lil wayne
Holy shit drake throwing shots about the girl he had sex with that was engaged for 8 years??? Lmao
uh huh 🔥
Nicki said it's corporate giants and machines that went against her, we all know who started this hate train and that Miley Cyrus' father, Nicki by calling out Miley Cyrus at the vmas she put all of Nashville against her! a lot of people try to deny that billy Cyrus had anything to do with this but we all know that's not true, even people in the industry who knew what's up pointed their fingers towards Nashville, and let's face it Miley is Dolly Parton goddaughter, do you really think that Nashville would have let Nicki got away with what she did at the VMAs?  hell no! I am happy to see that Nicki is back, this rap game is going to get lip up! now the only one who needs to come back to make this year perfect is my girl riri!
Maybe my taste in music has changed or something but this to me was...eh. Maybe cause they're aren't hungry anymore. No need to be I guess
THREE GOATS 🐐🔥
The flick in the beginning gave me nostalgia 🥰
Nikki live gave me coked out mess
That heather headley song was a hit.. this is giving LIFE

I can imagine my high school self hearing this in the AM on the bus goin to school and once I get there it's straight solo all day, I'm in my "let's get this work in" bag all day, nobody bothering me, no distractions, straight work, then go home feeling I had a productive ass school day and enjoy the rest of my evening playing call of duty, halo, GTA, NFS, and feasting like a adolescent king. The feels and vibrations from dis one is nuts
Big 3 are Back! We missed you Nicki! 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄

Years back during the Lollipop phase, Wayne said Young Money will be the future of music. And fast forward to today, prophecy fulfilled!!!!!!!!  + Weezy became the Bible for trap rappers. + Nicki became the persona of every female rapper. + Drake gave rappers the blueprint on how to write hits. (If you don't believe me, check the charts cause that's where Drake stays)
This is what I call a comeback after a hiatus 💐🙌🏾⭐⭐⭐⭐ #nickiminaj  #lilwayne #Drake #Fire

Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene.... 🥰❤
I love that they didn't pick a generic trap beat, this bangs 💣
Anyone in Sri lanka listing to thiss??..
❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥❤🔥 Periodt!!!
For those who were teens growing up in the 2010s at the PEAK of Young Money Era, only the real ones know how nostalgic and emotional this is! Real Bars, no gimmicks, true HIPHOP! (im 23 now and im still as excited as my 13 year old self in 2010!)
How come I’m playing this back to back
I am the star in any room that I stand in! I stand out you’re just my stand in 🔥🔥🔥

The fact that I had to replay this song about 7 times to catch every bar they was spitting . SMH this brings me back to carter3 3peat for Wayne , feel it in the air beat -Nicki Minaj and over my dead body -drake . They went in hands down .
" I seen more plaques than toothbrushes" - Drake saying he seen more plaques than tooth brushes,  plaques on the wall, not on teeth! For example Platinum plaques, Gold plaques these are songs or albums not the plaque on your teeth!
Thank y’all 👏🏾👏🏾

Wayne's part was too long and I didn't like it but the fact the 3 of them are together is EPIC NICKIIIIII YOU DONT EVER GOTTA TALK ABOUT IT IF YOU ARE ABOUT IT!!! so great to hear you again
Y’all why it’s not a single tho???? That music deserves a music video. Ionknow. It’s just way too perfect. We missed the queen of Rap so much. ❤️ I just want to wear YMCMB shirt again.
nicki bout to revive the rap game😩
*Three big names in the biz, hmmm?*   Is Drake the youngest of the three, just asking? I wonder if we are going to get the visual because I just love seeing too with the rap. I also wonder about the viewing numbers/likes for the census of the data I collect.
Nicki the only one with the hardest verse. I expected more from drake and a homerun from Wayne.
@redbottomyeezy
The Dream Team 💯💯💯💯YMCMB!!!!!sound like some Drake shyt Wayne got on and washed it. DO NUMBERS ON 2 CRUTCHES IM SCREAMING.

Lyrics -   [Intro: Lil Wayne & Heather Headley] Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah) Bae gave it to me (Haha) You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

Queen e The king's
nice song but nicki is being a hypocrite, how u gon call out female rappers when ur only 2 #1 hits were bc of tik tok? cardi nd meg never payed for ppl to do their tik toks! but nicki was paying total 16K for ppl to start a tik tok trends for her. she just mad her tik toks weren't viral. this is embarrassing. 'this aint no tik tok shit' this is what nicki said in the ig live. nicki just stop being a hypocrite. weren't u just on twitter telling fans to make u trend? like who does that? the barbz swear cardi is using payola and is desperate when it's nicki who does that! HYPOCRITE
643k lets count the vi3ws guys cz Ytube stealing!
ICONIC‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️🐐🐐🐐

Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir.

Yeah, hold up, hm    [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi     [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch    [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

Curious as to when Wayne’s part was recorded. Idk might just be me but it doesn’t really sound like recent Wayne. Good bars, he just sounds different to me
nobody peep heather headley vocals in the background from the song " in my mind" awesome
Man hearing Wayne rap like this again… no overdone auto tune… no high pitched vocals…. This is a treat to my ears
‼️”Known her 8 years and still F her like a new husband.”‼️ Drake sending shots at Jaime Sun as he is blamed for Jaime and Naomi’s 8 year marriage breakup when Drake flew her out to work on CLB. Forever Goat🐐
Car C. :p

SHESSSS FUCKINGGG BACCKKK WITH NEEWWW ALBUM SUPRISE🔥🔥
I always say Drake is a very dangerous rapper. see, ppl say he has a ghost writer, but we all know he a dope writer so he is dangerous coz he will never run outta stuff. he will switch to singing and use up the ghost writers, and when he wanna he will be dropping verses like this one so effortlessly while he watches other rappers getting extinct because they have used up their craft and have run outta things to say. so with that said, its not an affliction to have writers, i think it can prolong your life span and keep you relevant and controversial.
Its fire
I know Young MA used this same sample on of her Herstory tracks, so it didn’t hit as hard cause I really love Car Confessions

Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," the scene serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi   You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir
MARAVILHA

GO🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONEEEE
Producers are dope, but I feel like I am on another planet because I really think all 3 of these artists are terrible 🥴🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️..Wayne and his voice is so annoying. Nicki always sounds ignorant her bars are fucking terrible...🤦🏽‍♂️.... brainwash is real.
THE QUEEN IS BAC ! 👑
Let’s go Big 3. Everybody was spitting like it’s early 2000s, the bars were hard and the beat is reminiscent to the old Roc/Dipset Heatmakers tracks. Welcome back Nicki, thank you for representing.
What's the point of this song ??

The big 3
I was so excited for this, but it's too much Lil Wayne.. This song is trash.
Acting like y’all didn’t hear drake!?
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that Wayne bodied this song 🔥
Could had been way better still feel like she still throwing shot at bardi she must be doing something if that's the case cause she shouldn't have too when you have way more bars and flow so why even stoop to that level just saying 🤷
Damn wayne verse was way too long got on my nerves
GIFT
🥺😭🔥😝
Your girl is better in the morning like a slice of pizza 🔥 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
The motherfuckinggggg goats 🐐! This makes my heart so happy
Wayne went off in this bih🔥🔥

#Greatness
lil wayne is trash
Dont have to ever talk about it  when you are about it...
Hard asf ymcmb congrats to nicki we not just not going act like Wayne ain’t been spitting again either drake ain’t went no where so welcome back Wayne and nicki wat the game been missing
Nah boyy this hit hard
Ps. Drake's Putin line is reminiscent of rap when metaphors was king!
“Just brought a new car just to walk around it” DAMN imagine lol 🥲🥲😭❤️
this the sample that young ma used
Drake talkin heavy
I’m a keep it all the way 💯 Nicki’s verse was 🗑 let me explain why. First off I was a major fan until she started stuntin a little too much and it caught up with her. Cardi starts making noise and In no way shape or form can lyrically touch Nicki but Nicki allowed the powers that be to dethrone her 👀 All she had to do was not speak on it, and just make great music 🎶 PERIODT. Each song from that point was “These bitches my sons” over and over and her trying to validate who she feels she is and that’s when she loses 😞 No hate or shade, this is real talk here, if you can honestly tell me her verse was 🔥 you BUGGIN!! I High 🔑 wanted her verse to be FLAMES!!!! But this was heartbreaking 💔 So realistically we’re judging it off of Wayne and drakes verses cause there’s was masterful, Nicki had the alley oop 🏀 and failed! Damn yo!
Lol Wayne verse so hard I thought it was the old Wayne on an older song until I heard him talking about the pandemic.
Bro nicki snapped
This song deserves a music video😭😪
The goats thooo 🔥🔥🔥
Weezy bodied.
You know your early when you start receiving blessings from the comments 🙏
Im dead tearing up omg love u nicki this gave me chills !!!!!!!
THIS SONG FEELS LIKE YOUR DRIVING THROUGH NY late at night with all your windows down just speeding with this song up loud. Thank you for the likes btw. Have a nice day 👍
Dam 🔥🔥🔥💯
Ayee   that part 🤏🏾🤏🏾🤏🏾🤏🏾🔥🔥 YM 4 /LIFE BIH
Just bought a new car, not to drive it but to walk around it!! Sheesh..I felt that🔥🔥🔥
remember that nicki created the world, do not forget
We all needed this!!  Big barb for life fan ❤❤❤
Wayne could’ve did a little better
Yassssssssssssss booooom🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Uhmm not me being late😭😭anyways this ate😩periodt👑

After listening to new migos, this sounds rlly trash

I have new songs to memorize. "I am the standout you're just the stand in" - What I felt about Nicki and the rest of the girls and boys during the hiatus😂😂 I wanted Nicki to come back and run the rap game all over again. This proves that Nicki wasn't stopping bags, the rest just couldn't stand against her. Oop- these B's thirst I can see why they alcoholics😂😂
it’s not too late to unrelease this
Meek would’ve been fire on this beat agree to disagree
THIS IS HARD DAMNN!!

*This. With Parmesan and Garlic.*
Lil Wayne x Drake x Nicki Minaj = A Hit.
Nicki’s lyrics yall 😼💞:   Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in  I am the standout, you just my stand-in  These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in  That's why I'm private like the airports I land in  Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in  I ball in any arena, go let the fans in  I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden  These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'  I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic  Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic  One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic  These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics  Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it  Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it  Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent  Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'  He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet  Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot  These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?  My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?  No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me  It's corporate giants and machines that went against me  I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me  She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me"  Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green  Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team  The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen  I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene
Wayne's verse made me feel *a lot*
This remind me of some classic shit. This is haaaard.

Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," it seems serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen, though, to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi   [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir
Holy Trinity is back🔥
Just bought a car not to drive in but just to walk around it....

Cindarella's glass shoe, code blue: Sirius Crystal Skull,  but as I move with "3" legs/shoes the one extra is clearly on my head... (Som en Skodd hest) So really not a shoe, sort of a glass ball for my bird's brain, the main projector of my space, looking thru a crystal lense from inside my face... The Atlantis oval bar Lenses,  laying like hidden treasure on the oceans sandy bottom down under ground.... Deep deep down in the sands of time and ocean made around... Deep in my inner moon,  the window I looked thru my own dead head, before arrival to go hitting the ground..... I deserted Scapegoat,  with a red-ribbon bound in my mohair bangs, fell of the cliff to tumble on down to my death. My Trap already rigged and ready, I fell into this foreheads empty dead-head,  A space only kept open for trapping me a "falling goat" from the open up above head......  I fell to my death as a Hyper Aware Sensitive Watcher..... Where I was locked up for 7 years caged goat pet instead...  Oh what a terrible period of watching as the whole world around me seemed to altso have died and misplaced its head... Oh big black responsible hole 🕳 in my forehead, all thow must see and carry on your own back and shoulders as a extra pocket for the waste of the human head toilet....... How much must you see hear and carry with you, how will you handle your self when chaos is ALL around you....  Fill up Oh Black Hole inside me, And it shall at some time contribute to my caged part inside me... To push me backwards and by the end help flushing me out the backpack of byproducts....  7 rounds around the Sun my time finally done, 11.11.2018 I'm granted to come out my back as my own shadow, being pushed out the hole in the skull connected to the socket (spine-veins-nervous system)  From there my body remembers the path of my Kundalini,  out the back I slide  straight up again above me. (What went down must come up again to make it round)-and it actually worked that way really good as well... (I fell/bounced faster up again than it took me to fall down actually) Home again and to that familiar feeling of Souls deep loneliness,  Its so lonely at the top that it easily goes for being a "Heavens-Hell" to again be alone in Heaven Pearly Gate as well) (Linemor I Perlemor Skyen) (I can atleast help spread these mother-of-pearl colour shine around) Shine tha specters until they hitt all around, to be of use is a feeling of somewhat meaningfull to do when I'm around.  -Like a Usher thats waiting eternity to have something or someone to Usher from here in a empty crown..... (Japanese have some twisted morals about feelings like these hanging aroun) (but I'm no Samurai, my Ninja would not honer kill meg self with gutts on the ground)😅😇😜 -I am now my own former master offer sender,  To come back to big goat that once made a Sacrefice of me...  mini meg, Gemini, I changed my self and Jonny 2 sharks around so when I mini'me left the building and ground, Jonny twins keeps the house open for the rest of our work to be planted. -finished with ALL'now tho, so'now what?  but now I'm riding the Devils rigth arm side, the big chief Solver side only.....  The other half has not showed up yet so Chief Big Johand the Golden one,  Has the free access to write down and solidify all that's here written Golden....  Now, "Left"!- when your here Devil's Pen's Koagulater, you shall koagulate the new written era the much discussed thru time the "Golden-Ages"...the 22nd century. The Big Black Bird's final Wedding on "my groundthing" outside of time's and other limiting bindings...   The complete Kali-Yuga flipped over and broken...  layed down into ground as a Token,  A Token to Earth and ALL THE PAIN she has been carrying with no words ever to manage to communicate and signale thru words that are spoken, No collar translater to ask her children to help here...  That time is Finally long gone, and hidden behind the wast oceans of time... For eternity I am one!  This thing will not be able to come around the "broke'back'mountain" bend ever again!!!  After sufferings resigned and all is open.. I wonder, how will I change my patterns of self sufferings and sabotage of selfs wellness out in the open, to deserving happiness and love and allow my self to feel what was left unspoken....?  After some time I'm shure it will be a joy to experience the other side of the scales more open...  Only one turn reasoning i can not reprogram about this whole conundrum. That is the fact that without someone to share it with,  I see NO POINT of enjoying  and taking part in the physical bodys luxury of 3D experiences. So only one problem for Me left  in the world,  since all is good but this little problem, I promised my self to first handly think about a way to solve the problem!  Yay! Better than no action atleast.... Maby head is not ALL dead anymore. . I will find solutions instead of the faults! And i know that YOU WILL be here along the way around me, And I Know That You Will Somehow manage to Help Me!!  ❤🧡💛💚💙💜💋 The Man/Woman with the plan and even has a working 3D head... Trust Faith Hope & Patience i have my whole ass filled up with to work with instead..... Snipp Snapp Snute Så var min historie ute!! Takker for Praten! Vi ses siden!! ❤🥰 💋 Helt sikkert snart øyeblikk!! 😉

The fact that it has no dislike after 3hours. Says alot. Phewwww  The Queen is back with the Trinity 🥰🥰
Nicki Minaj Queen of Rap In The World
I remember when Nicki first came out then I first heard Bedrock and became infatuated with her. What an era...its all coming full circle 🔥👏🏿
If Young Money was your childhood, and now you’re making money as a young adult, then you’re Young Money too 😎💰💯
Song went pretty hard
"I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King" that's was fire🔥🔥
Wayne and Drake killed this
Cole just dropped a beautiful album and y’all put this out? Smh.
Dis song so old 🔥🔥🔥
Billboard Artis of the decade should be split three ways, don't yall agree?🤷🏾‍♂️
Drake never misses Istg 🐐💨
Feel like the old young money crew🥺🔥

“Tryna run a country like Putin one day but who’s rushin” - Drizzy   “And ever since the pandemic they don’t wanna let drake out of Canada and I’ve been screaming free Drizzy” - Weezy  “These bitches time tiktoking better stick to dancing” - Queen
That was dope
Back to the Basics 💯💯💕💕💕💕
WE ARE BACK IN TRACK YES SIRRRR
QUEEN OF RAP❤
Another one 🥺
Sorry but when Drake entered the scene, he stole it
To the next Gen kids. These 3 are the most iconic artists of our times. Music hasn’t been the same since Wayne got both Queen and Drizzy to the scene. And I can’t rest in peace till I get a collab with either. Back to grindin’ now. Don’t you kids give up on your dreams yet !
Lil wayne went off tf
AMAZING!👍
Damn this takes me back to 2009 shit is crazy nostalgic sounding

[Intro: Lil Wayne & Heather Hadley] Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah) Bae gave it to me (Haha) You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," it seems serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen, though, to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir
Legendary sh!t ryy here🙌🏾
this is the weezy we love! Not the mumble flow type weezy!
Nicki and Drake did really well. Lil Wayne was super unnecessary. He ruined the intro. Now I gotta skip every single time I listen to this on Spotify. Idk how people find Wayne good. Basic rhymes, Wack voice...
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She show out every time...
Drizzy just shi**ed on everybody's SRT's, Hellcats & Demons!

Last week I went to a small house gathering to see a friend and we put music on. I put on the song ‘moment for life’ and I said to my friend. “Ya know what, we need another collab with Drake and Nicki”. Today it happened and even  better too as Weezy is on the song too🔥 #YoungMoneyForever

DRAKE BROUGHT OUT THAT OLD DRAKE FLOW 🔥🔥🔥
[Intro: Lil Wayne & Heather Hadley] Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah) Bae gave it to me (Haha) You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," it seems serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen, though, to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi  Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in   I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is   You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through   Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir
"tiktok, better stick to dancing" we love a current and up to date goddess.

2:14 [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene

Same sample Young MA used for "Car Confessions"💥
Coming to #1
Nicki ran, stopped like yall didn't run when she was crawling with papabear? So now all I see is walkers.
Bra Weezy without bad auto tune is incredible 🔥🔥 the flow, word play, punchlines, n the pitch changes is damn near unbeatable 🙏🏽 3 headed goats 🐐🐐🐐
Nicki❤❤❤🔥
YOUNG MONEYYUYUY
Nicki don't need to hop into a high profile relationship or make false allegations to stay relevant! She just shows up to the function with STRAIGHT BARS!!
Nicki minaj talking about other female rappers in her songs again
SCREAMINGGGGG AAAAAA
Heeeeeeeaaaaaaattttt!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🌋
i think im in love yall
When Nicki said " just bought a new car not to drive but to walk around it"  She reminded me how broke tf I am 😔😔😔😭😭😭😭
This is that 2009 sound from the big 3. Almost 15 years in the game and Nicki still standing on business holding her own amongst heavyweights. Cardi B who? Nicki is the best female rapper in history.
I don’t want to see or hear Cardi B for the next 100 years, the Queen is back! ❤️❤️❤️
YM!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥WEEZY!!DREEZY!!!NICKIIEE!!! BUMBOCLAAT NOW!
The amount of bars in this should be illegal. 😩😩  “These bit$hes is my sons, who could ever deny it” is all facts
😱 This go too hard!
It will forever blow my mind how everyone was turning on Nicki during her Queen era. They was making her seem like such a bitter, bad person when she’s everything but. Now everyone is showing her so much love and I don’t believe them. Idk what’s genuine cause people just be wanting clout.
Is this a coincidence,Nicki and Cole dropped at the same time.😭
Don’t put no k behind that b ??????? Someone pls explain
Why nobody talking about how lil Wayne sounds like he’s back in 2008. I’m diggin it.
I was just around the corner by J Cole now am here this is history
Bar for bar🔥🙌🏾  Nicki is the queen of rap y'all no cap👑
Queen of Rap!!!
Queen I missed you Welcome back  I love you so much 😘😘😘 Love from 🇳🇬🇳🇬
Shiiiiiiit...now that's  what you call dropping💥
im am sooo geeeked!!!!!!
Fireeee 🔥🔥🔥
This is the real voice of Tunechi and Nicki and how they rap, we know about Drizzy no need to comment he the GOAT
Stanning Nicki Minaj isn't just a hobby, it’s a lifestyle, a reason to breathe, an escape from this cruel world. It’s art, the first gift you open on Christmas, a hug from a loved one🤗, everything you’ve ever wanted, everything you'll ever need, the universe itself. NICKI DAY!🔥🗣️
Fave 🔥🔥🔥🔥👑💕💕💕
greatest trio of all time
Wow queen I'm crying 😭😭😭😭
https://youtu.be/GuZET0xrBCs

Nicki flow, voice is just different.  Love it.
FEMALE RAPPERS LOST AF NOW CALLING UP THEIR GHOSTWRITERS TO WRITE SOMETHING OTHER THAN PU**Y LYRICS 😩😂😭 lol
🔥🔥Respectfully She can't be dethroned from her position... Yall should know that there's one queen & one throne for that queen.... Which is Nicki. She's definitely that Tree that produces fruit 👑 ❤️... Much love from South Africa 🇿🇦

Yeah, hold up, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, "Who asked y'all?" Cita told me to stunt my ass off, and that's all Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue, but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum I told her, "Keep me clean," it seems serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen, though, to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch Tunechi [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is You can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though You now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin' Man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir
I'm here for the wordplay.   I was not disappointed.

This is off topic but just encouraging everyone that life is short. Tooo short. It’s so sad that anyone of us reading this right now can here today and gone tomorrow. So please, if you’re reading this, please make it right with Christ (if you didn’t already) because if you miss heaven, you won’t miss hell 🙏✝️ I don’t know you personally but trust me, I want you to make it 🤗 and yes, Christ is recording this exact moment where I’m telling you all of this. So, on judgement day, He’ll replay this exact moment for you and you will have to give an account of your entire life. I really want this account that you’ll have to give to be one where He’s proud of you and He’ll say “well done my good and faithful servant”.

Not gonna lie I screamed and cheered and cried!!!
Meek just stay away from this beat. It’s dead. It’s been locked away. Anybody using this beat after will be embarrassing themselves. They should’ve gave this whole beat to Wayne! But Man! All these quotables!! They knew they had to come hard when they put Wayne first. In order: Wayne, Drake then Nicki. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 PSA Wayne’s been bringing heat like this on all his mixtapes since around the time of between ‘Dedication 5’ & ‘Sorry 4 The Wait 2’ up until ‘No Ceilings 3’ and this verse right here‼️

Yeah, yeah, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all who asked y'all See, who told me to stomp my ass off? That's all bop-bop-bop-bop-bop He was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum, I told her Keep me clean it seems serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen, though, to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put ya six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch, Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is you can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though, you now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj and y'all still dyin', man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

[Intro: Lil Wayne & Heather Hadley] Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah) Bae gave it to me (Hm, huh) You think? Yeah, yeah, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all who asked y'all See, who told me to stomp my ass off? That's all bop-bop-bop-bop-bop He was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum, I told her Keep me clean it seems serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen, though, to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put ya six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch, Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is you can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though, you now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj and y'all still dyin', man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 G-O-D, CMB, yes sir

Intro: Lil Wayne & Heather Hadley] Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah) Bae gave it to me (Hm, huh) You think? Yeah, yeah, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all who asked y'all See, who told me to stomp my ass off? That's all bop-bop-bop-bop-bop He was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum, I told her Keep me clean it seems serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen, though, to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put ya six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch, Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is you can afford to be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though, you now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj and y'all still dyin', man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 God, CMB, yes sir

Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene

That's all bop-bop-bop-bop-bop He was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum, I told her Keep me clean it seems serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen, though, to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put ya six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch, Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?

We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green 6 God, CMB, yes sir
Love it ❤️❤️❤️💯👌🏻🔥

The Big 3's in one song- I love this reunion! Ooooh Lil Wayne, did you come to destroy the track?This is top notch and Nicki came through as always. "They are your sons, who can ever deny it" lol- Onika Maraj I see you! I love Drake's hype and his part was good too.  You all did it- Respect👏👏👏

Wb queen we missed you
Nicki needs to drop a whole album rapping on this level with beats this good. If she does that she’ll really get the credit as a rapper that she deserves. Her being a top tier MC will barely be of discussion if she does that.
Love the Song… #theQueenisBack #nickiminaj

Lyrics :  [Intro: Lil Wayne & Heather Hadley] Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm smokin' tarantula (Yeah) Bae gave it to me (Hm, huh) You think? Yeah, yeah, hm  [Verse 1: Lil Wayne] I'ma pull up so lit I just might crash, dawg Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all who asked y'all See, who told me to stomp my ass off? That's all bop-bop-bop-bop-bop He was a good cat, my bad, dawg Don't put no K after that B, boy, bad call, that's flag talk Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to As a matter of fact, I had two No cap, I'm on the capsules, I done relapsed, boo But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe That cash blue but I'm still seein' green I'm in the bathroom and I'm peein' lean My bitch a vacuum, I told her Keep me clean it seems serene I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street How I go from bars on the screen, though, to the TV screen? Don't ask me, but never change the channel Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta We get it, it's the same in each city My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's And ever since the pandemic They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada I been screamin', "Free Drizzy" I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison Said, "I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit" Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women But I'm the greediest shark amongst the ocean of killers I put ya six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens Just come and see about it, bitch, Tunechi  [Verse 2: Nicki Minaj] Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in I am the standout, you just my stand-in These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in That's why I'm private like the airports I land in Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in I ball in any arena, go let the fans in I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin' I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic Big-ass backyards, just so Poppa Bear could frolic One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it Just call me Nicki, cock the blicky, the Minaj is silent Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin' He call me solid even though I'm drippin' water diet Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it? My packs hit different, who could ever supply it? No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me It's corporate giants and machines that went against me I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me She said she hot, I said, "Well, bitch, come and convince me" Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene  [Break: Drake] You know, one of the perils of makin' money is you can be dramatic Y'all some drama queens, for real It's all good, though, you now tuned in to the biggest, ever YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj and y'all still dyin', man, wassup? We in this bitch  [Verse 3: Drake] This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches Seen more plaques than toothbrushes Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin' All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin' Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'? I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'? El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from Doubletree Step your suites up, I get to Oliver to set the beats up 2021, I had to wet the streets up Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza That's when I had to hit her with the, "Nice to meet ya" You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T Could try and get close but you won't, I already packed the garage None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade None of this shit's a mirage Thought I was seein' great things when I was seein' green 6 God, CMB, yessir
Whoever reading this I hope you have a bless year 🙏🏾❣️
