Hey  what chi Jongho is bored October 12, 2002 my brother born March 2, 2002 this is they are  Brothers
So it's bad for me to use the phrase "Mickey Mouse" because it's trademarked, but it's okay for me to use "Mickey the Mouse."
I'm in 2025
1:49 I feel so called out
Me waiting for my fav shows to enter the public domain so I can release my fav fictions
When/if lion king enters public domain I’m immediately making a final destination style film with Simba as Alex browning
The editing is so peak
The opening with EVIL Mickey is just amazing
My only question: What about a parady?
noone can replace pooh
1:49 … caught in 4K I was
I didn't know I really wanted to understand this thanks
I mean, they are disney’s characters.
1:48 how did he know💀
The Peter Pan as a (for lack of a better term) demon, is far more accurate than Disney's version of Peter Pan. He steals children, uses them, gets them killed in combat (with pirates) and when they age (which they all age slowly in Neverland) he is just done with them. He abuses Tink repeatedly, the real Peter Pan is freaking terrifying.
I need the Bambi’s the recoding
How did mat pat know I had no pants on ?
I think they should have been able to keep their copyright
Wait, wait, wait? Isn`t fanfiction only illegal, when you make money with it? I mean, people have written fanfics about all sorts of stuff o-o
1:48 how did he knowl
who’s here in 2025
🥄supper man🍴
What does Disney World have that Disneyland does not?
I saw 1:50 and I'm like hey that's me right now
11:10 anybody else hear matpat turn in Kermit the frog for a second here?😂
am i the only one who seen the tf2 flame thrower in this video
Bro. I’m re watching old videos, and I genuinely got jump scared. How do you know I have no pants on 😭? Like it’s hot and I’m my room, let a boy live
who needs school when we have this
Hey tom you wont. See this but i want to make my own theroy on something you have i rewrote the script so its mine but i dont know if you wont like it
Bro, you teach me more than school ever could.
well wouldn't this be good for disney i mean it gives them more atention
There was a very actually gore childhood rhyme in Sweden with wine the Pooh or a similar character, taking a good old childhood rhyme which actually was quite popular back some years ago like 10 or so.
How did you know I’m not wearing pants 😱 1:49
worst and most boring theory ever way to scrape the bottom of the barrel
so my head lillow is illegal cuz it has Marvels then has a superman logo
I used this video for my essay on the Public Domain. I made sure to include the proper citation.
Winnie Pooh sounds familiar…
Watching this while hugging my 2ft tall Winnie the Pooh I just got from Disneyland. Smart 🤣👍  Legit the doll you showed at the end of the video is the one I was hugging!  13:55 🤣🤣🤣
Push reset i guess
Mickey is still not public domain😅
1:48 how did you know that I don’t have pants on?
Hey you guys I like your videos I wish that I could be in them sooner or later.
Criminal laws to keep the rich rich
U just got way too personal I was abt to take a shower when matpat said I own Winnie the Pooh he said “yes u sitting at home without ur pants on.😅
I've been thinking about making my own anime what's my gacha Life characters I made
1:48 HOW DID HE KNOW
so does that mean dc owns angry joe!
Day 73 of asking for a theory on Woodlands National Park by Buddy Films Productions.
I’m watching this is 2024 this is to goofy
Latterly me 😂
1:47 how did u know
January is only a little over a month away. Time for Mickey's horror house.
There's this really creepy story about Winnie the pooh So you know the little boy right? Well apparently he sowed three kids into the costumes and they grew into them.
So what you're saying is that theoc/avery is Coperited by me so if I do get popular no one can steal it
Well. I agree. I support this video.
1:49 HOW DID YOU KNOW
11:15 What happened to Mat’s voice? He sounds like someone doing a terrible impression of the teacher from South Park. “Trademarks are bad mmkay?”
2054
2024
does this apply to fnaf?
1:47 " Yes you sitting at home without your pants on" had me laughing so hard. 😂
Considering the fact that they're still bleeding money even a year after this video released & how much damage they've done to their own brand already, I don't see Disney being able to keep even this trademark trickery up for nearly as long as they'd like to.  Same goes for all these other mega-corporations, btw.
2:33 well i heard that Thomas and friends will be in the public domain in many years time
Anyone in 2024
1:50 First of all, rude. *turn his laptop camera off*
Why was Winnie voiced by Kronk 😂 is they actually voiced by the same guy 😮
Are you saying dis knee or Disney
At time of watch, I am in fact not wearing pants. I am wearing shorts.
11:15 why does Matpat begin to sound like Kermit
I watched many horror and didnt flinch but bbb but the legal loop holes scare
who is here after matpat quit?
wait that is a horror movie not a recording of china's dictator xi zhenping?
Who else remember this day in this year
Luckily, I’m not gonna show this to my mom
Useful ❤
not matpat knowing i didn't have my pants on 😭
Wait what about inside out?
The Prototype
I'm from UK like tom yes tom is here which means Matt quit 😢😢😢 I don't watch the new vids it's just not the same I'm watching the old ones with mat in
Ya😅
9:03 I did a Winnie the Pooh play and tigger wasn’t there either! My mom was real dissapointed
Not matpat predicting the second movie😂
Remember, copyrighted = cannon
I live in Canada
The new movies should be better cause at 3.4 million bucks they can now afford to use the actual voices for the characters. So I'm expecting some really fun quips and jokes from the hybrids.
13:34
1:48 how does he know
1:47 how he knew that
While I’m watching this it’s a mix and it’s been horror theory’s
These channels teach you more then school.
Did you know pooping means baby baby means poop is Winnie the babe
16:25 who here agrees that we literally use Disney to described Mickey and vice versa
Tldr; copyright is the picture you drew, trademark is your signature
This is an actual movie?
17:50 matpat predicted mickey mouse trap
if they make a tigger horror movie, i hope they stay lore consistent and include the "bones made of springs" thing that he sings about in the show. i'm not sure if it was in the books though...
🧸🐖
Here in 2024 and just watched the Film Theorists video about the preview for Mickey's Mouse Trap last night.
I love you matpat your my favorite YouTuber in the world 🌍🎉
Mat pat predicted the steamboat willy hype.
excellent, you just have to be patient. finally, the true history of middle-earth can be told!
Experiment 1006 at 3:30:enemy spotted!
1:48 I HAVE MY PANTS ON 😡🤬😡
Newest comment
I hate to break it to you but I'm in April of 2024 and there is a horror movie of Mickey mouse how do I know this because you're old because you knew host told talked about a which Mickey
The catch is that trademarks have to be renewed every ten years.  Trademarking every iteration of a character is liable to get quite expensive.
YOU HAD ME A DISNRY HORROR MOVE!!!! 😁😁😁😁😁😁
He didn't mention the kangaroo mom and her son Roo, did they enter the public domain or not?
I don't like the fact that colors, smells and sounds are being trade marketed
How did he know
matpat we will miss you u also predicted the future because of the new mickey mouse horror movie
I know of a cafe alr called "The Hobbit" lol, it was made like 7 years ago aswell
Why are you talking about scary stuff all the time his skills me
I watched that movie before
Free my boy sapnap  he did nothing wrong
Winnie the Pooh literally the scariest character ever
@
FilmThoery I don't ever see it! But I hope you see this one day! My teacher in Choir class is going through copyright laws. She used this video!!! Me and my friend were so happy and excited!!!! I love you guys and hope you keep going strong despite the haters!!! And thank you so much for the video!! Mat Pat have a wonderful retirement!!!
You caught me I don’t have my pants on
I am now the lord of Mickey Mouse hahahahaahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahaha
How tf did you know i have no pants on right now
Thy hobbit ☕
Corporal father keeepbit. Haha strunggggg
Skinsmari l ween
I'm wearing pants for once😂
for the superman trademark conundrum after it enters the public domain just title him boy-super
All of the characters from Winnie the Pooh have a different disability
This would have been better as an ARG than a cheap movie
Matpat got out before the cinematic universe of this began. Now it's Lee's problem.
Why did I see the prototype
"Yes, you, sitting at home without your pants on"....... How did he know?
4:34 isn’t that the prototype from Poppy playtime????
You can't give Superman all his current powers. But you could give him NEW powers
1:46 no further context..
No, no, please watch your version of crabby, Disney rip off movies
My god leve the kid alone shes teying to wright a book
I was actually sitting home in my boxers without my pants on
Matpat calling me out for watching on the toilet 😮😳
Me watching this knowing Mickey’s Mousetraps horror movie is going to come out: 🧍‍♀️
That same studio is making a Steamboat Willie horror movie.
cool
0:18 BAHAHAH- 0:21 wow.. Mickey mouse!?! 0:28 freaking amazing and love your vids!
Who was voicing Pooh at the beginning?
Anyone else rewatching this after Steamboat Willie entered the public domain
Me watching this vid when steamboat horror movie trailer is released
*kinda wanna watch that winnie the pooh horror movie tbh*
My mom and I watched this. It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't *great*. More gorey than scary.
Y is Winnie called Pooh???💩
In a century we will start to see matpats the final theory
There was a guy who published an "official" sequel to The Lord of the Rings. Got sued into oblivion. Maybe he should have waited a little bit.
Disney be like:hu hu I'm in the public domain.2023.oh fu_
Imagine watching this video on Jan 3 2024. 2 days after Tigger was released to the public.
Matpat? How did you know that I wasn't wearing any pants?
Engagement engagement engagement
2:00 i❤️TI
its jan 31 2024 that means tiger CR is lifted
Wonder how walt would think of this
1:46 AYO WHAT OK HE GOTS CAMS OK ME
They didnt call it Winnie The Twoh?
luckily for me hulk hasn't changed much
fun fact we did get a horror mickey version
12:46 Fun fact the hyphen in Spider-Man's name was inserted because Stan Lee felt that he could get into legal troubles with DC without it because both Superman and Spider-Man's names started with S and ended with man.
0:19 he sounds familiar
Now that Mickey Mouse is public domain, there's already a horror movie planned.
The pants thing was targeted
Like I can legally uss grinch but he can’t be green also it’s 2024 and I was saying we need a Mickey mouse movie for a while like a official movie and now I can’t make it DUs this apply to YouTube?
I am from January 27th 2024 so tigger(I might have spelt it wrong)is in the public domain :)
MATPAT did not need to call me out for not wearing pants like that!
what ab music tho
Me watching this in 2024 🤠👍
The posters from steamboat willy are in public domain now though, so the characteristics on those posters you can use too.
16:45 But you know what they didn't trademark? NSFW WORK OF MICKEY
How did he know?
Who was here bcuz of matpat
im wearing pants, matpat
I’m gonna miss you 😢 so much
How did he know I wasn’t wearing pants
I find it interesting you said “if you have to do all these things for superman, is it worth it at this point?”  Because creation isn’t a buisness, it’s an artistic expression.
Trademarks should end when copyright ends.
Ayy Tigger is in the public domain now.
There's a Mikey horror trailer!
Disney could put the Disney horror movies made by fans on Disney + to earn more money
People who actually looked up copyright theory 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇
I hate the public domain for this, this is just like slendytubbies! 😡
It kind of shocks me thinking that copyright isn't your worst fear its trademark
is that why marvel logos are the way they are
Yes there is a steamboat Willie horror movie coming out
I watch this version of Winnie the Pooh and it was so wow and amazing
Wow, deja vu.
Everyone sitting at home with our pants off: He knows us well.
I jumped when he said “without your pants on”
At least the first Mickey is ours now!!
now there is micky bamby and peter pan
JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED MENTIONED!!!!!!!!!!!
2:23 Who's that guy coming in from the right? He kinda looks like Shawn from The Good Place, but I have no idea.
I'm back from the future, Mickey Mouse has now entered the public domain (Specifically his steamboat willie appearance). While there are multiple horror movies releasing with no legal tension around them, Disney is still copyright claiming YouTube videos that feature Mickey. So sadly
1:48 IM LITERALY SITTING IN MY UNDERWEAR LOLOL
Bro just described half of the SMG34 community!(No hate I ship them 2) 9:26
Everything is possible when your government is bought and paid for
oh hey cartoon rat is public this month? cool
Matpat retired
How do you know I have no pants on and just a shirt 😰 1:47
It is 2024 🤗
Adult swim took advantage
THE MOUSE IS OURS!
i can speak for everyone here we are more hyped for winnie the poo 2 then GTA6
I am very scared for Donald Duck’s copyright time to run out but... I WAS thinking about making a parody news program starring him, so... yeah.
It's 2024.....
Disney minus is going crazy in 2023 and 2024
Matt patt please look at mickey's mousetrap
2024!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And also you might be right disney is still copyrighting movies of the steamboat willie
I love how the moment Steamboat Willie entered public domain there have been dozens, if not hundreds of uploads of the entire cartoon just daring Disney to come after them. That's what's needed to have real change. Laws are just dead pieces of paper until court gets involved. Disney can try using trademark to strike down those bootleg versions of Steamboat wille but there's enough public attention right now that anyone who gets struck down by such could get enough funds to fight it out in court, and once precedent is clearly set Disney can never try to do it again without being slapped with frivolous lawsuit charge.
I demand a Star wars horror movie with Darth vader as the main antagonist! A horror movie of vader hunting jedi would be cool asf to watch.
2:43 He is now part of the public domain
Mickey's Mouse Trap is the Steamboat Willie horror movie coming out soon.
Ive come from future. In  2024 a micky mouse horrer movie is comeing out
Back here with Steamboat Willie being used for every horror game am low budget horror movie
that intro aged so well, with steamboat willy
11:34 stuffy nose
Steamboat Willy
10:07 an animal abuser
and now after mickey mouse after copyright expired now we need to wait to mickey mouse horror movie and game
sooo will we have a horror game of pooh? I'd love to play thaat!
sooo will we have a horror game of pooh? I'd love to play thaat!

Parodies (they are legal):
here from 2024 all ONLY streamboat willie or the mickey mouse from plane crazy will be in the public domain
7:51 yes matpat we will
HE IS OUT GUYS!
this year! WOOOO
I’m watching this 4 days after Mickey Mouse was entered the public domain and there are already horror movies and games on Mickey Mouse
There’s a micky mouse horror movie (mickys mouse trap)
Micky Mouse
I'm about what about finger puppets and puppets for Winnie the Pooh matpat you didn't say anything about finger puppets and puppets make sure you mention that
Whos watching this a year ;later when Steamboat willie's in the public domain and that's Disney's even bigger fear?
Mickey is in public domain! Edit: and Tigerr.
So how come Pooh sound like Joe swandson at the start?
“You, yes you sitting at home without your pants on” 😂
We need to fix laws now, cuz this will scare kids for life
Who is here now that the mouse is in public domain
So in like 90 years pepol will be making moveis about a crazed thoeryist who kills for loare
aged well
Can u do a Peter rabbit video pls
People who have come back in 2024   | \/
This has taught me more about copyright that all school
A. A. Milne Wrote winnie the pooh not Disney
I was shitting as he said that haha
Can't someone make a fully animated horror movie using these newly public domain characters? Why have they all been lame live action slashers? If only the phantom blot were in the public domain. A fully animated horror movie featuring him would be nothing short of amazing!
yes there is going to be a Micky mouse horror movie called mickeys mouse trap
I hate this dumb low budget movie of the mouse
I predict a future where there will be a company who is the dark version of Disney taking every once owned Disney mascot and converting it to horror.
Its january 2024 day 3 we already have a steam boat willie movie and game 😂
THEY MADE A MICKEY HORROR MOVIE😢
Winnie the Pooh:💀💀💀💀💀  Rule 34😏😏😏🫏🍆🐖🍑
I’m from the future and he is right Mickey Mouse is not covered by copyright anymore
copyrights and trademarks are two completely different things. the former prevents others from reproducing or creating derivative work based on the IP. on the other hand, trademarks prevents others from using the IP in such a way that it confuses the consumers. so if you use mickey mouse as a brand identifier for the kind of merchandise Disney would sell or to use him as a corporate/studio logo then trademark laws would apply, but if you use mickey mouse in a new artistic work(comics, video games , movies) ,in that case,  trademarks laws can not be invoked. according to the supreme court ninth circuit, trademark laws can not be used to prevent the creation of artistic works based on public domain characters, doing so would be the equivalent of a permanent copyright extension which is not supposed to happen because trademarks can not do that.  if you make it clear to your audience that this work is not created nor sponsored by Disney, you are in the clear.   Disclaimer: I am providing amateur advice, I m not a legal expert on the matter.
Bro, how did he know I did not have my pants on.
1:48 how did you know
Welp, Mickey is in the public domain, and there are already dumb horror spinoffs coming fast
Watching this after mickey is now public
This aged well.
1:48 I feel called out
You without you ur pants on I’m literally on the toilet with no pants
Matpat predicted the name of the Mickey Mouse horror movie 10:20
Tiger is now public
He caught me! 1:47
Welp Steamboat Mickey Mouse is joining the horror trend
How did he know I didn’t have my pants on💀💀💀💀
3:56 "before we get started"
I am from the future, specifically the day that a Mickey Mouse horror movie got confirmed. 02/01/2024 or 01/02/2024 for those from the U.S!
Funny that we are now getting a mickey horror movie
Weaponize trademark? That explains why hasbro has to spam transformer names at random
How did he know i wasnt wearing pants
Legal Eagle needs to do an episode on this.
Bro, I support the "end woke" mickey mouse nft, but they are gonna lose alot becu, they used modern mickey mouse😭
Bro is teaching me about legal things better than school
Mickey is OURS!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm commenting this in 2024, and I'm pretty sure Disney is going to die soon
now there is this doll store that we drive by and it uses Disney's writing so is that ilgle
It is now 2024......
There is going to be a Mickey Mouse horror movie in Canada the trailer is out now and it’s called mickey’s mouse trap
Only people who come danodraw's showtime out can like this comment  ⬇️
Mickey's Mouse Trap bouta go wild
Just came here to realise mickey mouse is in the public domain now.
OG Mickey Mouse joined the chat:
My elementary school had superhero logos on the lunchroom wall would that be illegal?
People watching in 2024 👇
Well we’re here in 2024 and it looks like everyone’s right, the steam boat willie version of mickey mouse is now in the public domain
👇Like if you are here from danno
I actually have a good pitch for a steam boat Willie game ok so It’s starts on steamboat Willie  cutscene yk when he’s whistleing and then Mickey mouse (steam boat Willie) sinks down in ink And he sinks back up in a ware house kind of with these inky guys kind of like the lost from bendy and the ink machine  and the lost one explains that If he doesn’t beat the evil Pete (from steamboat Willie who also escaped) he will be forgotten so it’s up to them to stop him (ps it would be like a paper Mario and Cuphead game
I'm here from danno
I think these legal loopholes should definitely be fixed. Copyright limitation is therefore a reason and there shouldn’t be such simple loopholes for huge companies to continue to such large control over them
7:40 GOOD as it should be it means these huge companys can be dickheads any more
It’s now January 2nd 2024 😮
Is this me or Matt sound off?
People in 2024: what At 2:38
Hmm, not that Mickey's out and discussion's are strting up again, I do wonder if these companies will really eb able to hold onto as much as this video suggests using Trademarks. Courts are wise to companies attempts to use Trademark as permanent pseudo-Copyright and they are not pleased by it.  So also not a lawyer here, but Superman's shield for example: you probably can't use any of them for branding & logos for example, but I don't think they'd really be able to say you can't put any version of the shield whose first appearance is in the public domain onto your depictions of Superman. There is a threat of DC trying something if you do, but the courts likely won't play ball.  Though with how much people are chomping at the bit to play with Mickey, I'm sure we'll see some court cases in play soon enough. So we'll have to see how right or wrong I am on this.
1:48 How did you know?! 💀
Who is here after Mickey and Minnie have official entered public domain?  Jan 1st 2024
We can now use Mickey for whatever we want...
I'm back here after hearing that "Steam Boat Willy" Mickey entered the public domain and is now in multiple horror-related media...
I’d say it’s worth making these things even with limitations.
Can't wait for the Mickey Mouse horror movie (or analog horror series) to become a thing one day.
its today
Boy oh boy, ain't this aged so well.
Anyone watching when mickey mouse is now out in the public domain
It's now 2024 , the time has come
People here 2023 December 31 1:11😅
When will R.Crumb's Fritz The Cat be public domain
HOW DOES HE KNOWS I AM NOT USING PANTS?!?!?
23 hours
I'm very very intrigued. Love to see the sequel and Bambi and Peter Pan.
That legal mousetrap visual gag was really good. Not only because the mouse itself is the bait on the trap, but triggering the trap would cause a gavel to slam down on your hand. Just a very clean representation.
how did you know I wasn't wearing my pants whell watching this video🤣
“You know what Mickey one day you’ll be public domain and they’ll make a horror film off of YOU”          - (jakenutron)Oswald the lucky rabbit
Man I love low budget horror so much
South Park respects women the Pooh more! Heck they’d rate this movie a new one
OMG WAS I THE ONLY ONE TO NOTICE THAT THE WEIRD ROBOT HAND (at this part of the video 3:30) IS THE PROTOTYPE'S HAND FROM POPPY PLAYTIME?!
The intro man 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How do you know I'm not wearing pants 😅
Superman already has 1 it's called bright burn
14:07 - 15:08 - The dashes between Winnie - The - Pooh are also the same as in .A.A. Milne’s book.
5:12 mathew paric
Love the implication that paddington is apparently horror pooh as an original IP
ngl i think the movie was underrated for a good reason.
17:54 - 18:00 - Who is that Superman character on the right? I know of Paddington Bear, and, Bendy The Devil, but, who is that Superman OC supposed to be? Oh, now I get it, Homelander, from The Boys.
2:45 - 2:55 - Honestly, which episode of South Park is this clip from? I ask, because Mickey Mouse, whose full name in the show is Michael Theodore Mouse, has appeared in multiple South Park episodes, and probably some of the @Paramount Plus movies.
Maybe some day we'll get a Hobbit horror movie. Maybe one day...
Wait are you saying that the decades of Disney Lobbying for longer and longer copyright laws has finally come to a close? They can't keep perpetually shoving as far away as possible from the public domain and profiting endlessly?  I'm honestly a little surprised that some of their IPs were allowed to leave their clutches.  EDIT: well... I suppose that makes sense. They wouldn't actually allow for anyone to make anything new and originals.
welp i cant make that cool winnie the pooh game
BRO I DID NOT HAVE MY PANTS ON WHATTTTTTTTTT
1:48 Uncalled for was about to take a shower
How much do you hate disney
HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS SITTING IN HOME WITHOUT MY PANTS ON?!?!?! 💀 And that purple hared girl looks like me(I mean the hair)
Ok but that school shouldn’t have pirated that movie, Disney was right to fine them
I’m going to say this: a peter pan horror movie isn’t a bad idea.
Oh god If Mickey goes into the Public Domain that means Tommorow's Pioneers might be able to revive Farfour
5:46 I know what film I’m uploading to the “horn pub” 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
How dare you assume I don't have pants, it doesn't matter that you're right I'm still offended!
Disney is one of the worst companies out there, don't give them your money friends
Shout-out to matpat for being able to tastefully reference politics, something almost never seen on YouTube.
Disney is coming to an end soon i feel
Bro how tf did he guess I had no pants I'm SHITTINGGGG
Matpat always makes learning so interesting. Especially how interesting it is for corporations like Disney to do anything and everything to make sure that they're the only ones making money on anything. I mean what a shame it would be if Disney missed out on 4 million dollars. It puts such a dent on the billions they're doing nothing with. I'm all about protection, but my God there should be a limit. They own everything already. How greedy do you really have to be about everything?
you will not believe this but i did not click on this video to consume 18 mins of copyright law
1:46 Please help! Matpat is in my walls and I can hear him crawling watching my every move.  He probubly knows im typing this right now and my hair stile at this exact moment. (No Seriously how did he know?)
NAH NAH WAIT HOW’D YOU KNOW I DIDN’T HAVE PANTS ON AND OPAT HOME
It's not mickey mouse's problem
Horror movie mickey needs to be played by Warwick Davis
This reminds me of how they made The Banana Splits into a slasher movie.
13:23 just name him duperdude or something
Um… how’d he know I had no pants on?
How did matpat know I'm watching this video without any pants on?
Winnie the Pooh: :) Winnie-the-Pooh: :o
Next they will make curios George gets a little to curious
i'd rather be original than make a cheap knock-off of something. who would wanna live in a universe where there's no originality? NOT ME!!!
I love how he put Kingdom Hearts Mickey😁 7:18
next thing you know ariel's gonna become a siren and get revenge on the shark that tried to eat them with flounder and she's gonna be scary asl
So, all that was how "Chip and Dale: Resue Rangers" 2022 got made?
Bro spe t most of the vidio talking about copyright the  the actual movie
No Winnie the poo is much better than Winnie the pooh
To be honest, this is just my opinion, it was a decent movie. Yeah it wasnt the best, but it was ok
How did he know I was pants-less? 👁️👄👁️
Disney's biggest fear is new IP
I mean... I don't want Superman to enter public domain.
Y_y_yes!
I_i_i own it?
1:48 i was in the bathroom when this part came on
There kinda already is a Superman horror movie - its called Brightburn
You kinda have it to give this one to Disney: the knew how to move through that legal loop hole just by including the og animation into their logo.
The copyright on Mickey Mouse will expire next year in January I'm kind of interested to see what people will do with it.
This movie isn't that bad. It's a generic throwback horror movie. I actually like the idea of people being able to take twists to known characters/story. Even Disney has done that.
2:38 every time Mickey is in danger of entering PD, they increase the timeline. Mickey Mouse's age plus 1
I could still see something. Steamboat Willie being useful specifically on YouTube for those people that had to change the name like it never showed up on screen but like when they were telling the story like them just being able to say it without having to change or make a slight altercation would probably be incredibly useful
Wait how do you know I have no pants on 😂😂😂😂 😮😮😮
Very informative, thanks! I now know what the difference is between a copyright ©️ and a trademark ®️ ™️. I just wish some franchises' copyrights WEREN'T expiring. I mean, come ON people! You already ruined dolls and clowns for horror movies. Can't they make a better movie out of it? It's like people are out to permanently ruin everyone's childhood innocence! Now every time they think of a character like Winnie the Pooh, they'll think of the horror movie 😢
im kind of angry about what they did to winni the pooh
MatPat: no, please I don’t want to watch a Disney rip off horror movie Winnie the Pooh : well, too bad😈😈😈  MatPat : Mickey Mouse😰😰😰 Mickey Mouse: you betcha MatPat :noooooooo😰😰😰😰😱😱😱
Is this why WBTV can make TV shows about Superman but not about Batman?😅
Just when you think things cant get worse for Disney, they lose Mickey Mouse...
Disney is getting mad so they took film theory so they could get more money😂😂😂
HOW DO YOU KNOW I DONT HAVE MY PANTS
A.A. Milne and Walt Disney are crying in the afterlife.
This explains how I and everyone else is able to write stories on the fanfiction website
So can we use Oswald? I like Oswald more than Mickey anyway… what about Horace Horsecollar?
nice poppy playtime reference
how did he know I wasn't wearing pants
Really said everyone on the teams a nerd
I want the Bambie horror movie
IS NO ONE QUESTIONING THAT HE JUST CALLED US OUT?!?
Hello internet welcome to legal theory
13:16 am i allowed to change super man’s power ?
Kung fu panda will put disney out
THAT IS SO RIDICULOUS!!!! WINNIE THE POOH IS NOT DISNEY'S WORST NIGHTMARE!!!! DISNEY WILL NEVER GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!!!!! 😡
art can be copyright
🥵
11:15 why did I hear Kermit 💀
4:35 If only this video existed before the whole REACT copyright thing some years ago XD
If i made a movie like that it’d be the worst most ridiculous most shameful movie ever just to show the mouse i can.
When can I use goku
I didn’t know I was going to be hearing about what Copyright and Trademark tonight 😂
Yo he caught me he im watching on the toilet
The neverland one sounds good peter pan has always been a little dark
you can start your videos with steamboat willie whistling in a year?
Was that Joe Swanson
So could you technically make the chest crest on superman a circle or trapazoid?
How did he know I didn’t have pants on 💀1:47
I kinda wish there would be a "conspiracy theory" channel, not the  blame someone or something for a thing but stuff that basically goes "Stuff doesn't add up, lets figure it out" and possibly helping put out more disproving info for those simply silly ones.
I wish we could get Star Trek and Star Wars in public domain.
One of the worst thing I've seen from these kind of laws is that the AFL (Australian Football Legue) (I'm Aussie) wants to start an official AFL team for Tasmania, but they can't call themselves the 'Tassie/Tasmanian Devils, an Aussie animal, and their state animal,  because Warner Brothers owns the trademark to the name 'Tasmanian Devil', and they're currently in the middle of a lengthy legal battle for the rights for the name.
I simultaneously love and hate copyright and trademark laws... On the one hand, its really annoying that you can get sued and ruined financially just for including a copyrighted character or name in your product, but on the other it means people can't steal and ruin those beloved characters very easily.
Can I make a channel about gorilla tag with serious I’m just asking to get your confirmation Mac pat
my childhood gonna get ruined
I kinda wonder if copyright also applies to concept art...
Wait. So if they can trademark frames then why don’t they trade mark ALL THE FRAMES?
How do you know that I don’t have Pants on……
I like how trademarks only work in the country of origin and sites online, but if you made a cafe or shop in an other country and name it disney that isn't shown on the internet they can't do anything about it, unless I'm somehow wrong with that deduction of how trademarks works.
Mickey mouse already got turned into a horror story 😭.
ngl i found this movie so funny and enjoyed it for exactly that. The whole cinema was brought together as we all laughed and commented as the movie went on. Really good memory
I seriously don’t understand how the box office was $3.8 Million, if this film was so bad.
When Disney met FNAF Winnie-The-Pooh Was made. Milk milk lemonade, round the corner fudge is made.
ANTI XI JINPING PROPOGANDA but it is a HORROR MOVIE
I think DC also trademarked Super-Man and/or Super Man for some things, since they have a secondary set of supers.
There’s actually a SCP that is actually a playground where there’s a lot of bears that works in that actually are just like that bear from that film I don’t remember what’s that SCP’s number but it’s dangerous
I am currently on the toilet, so the “yes, you, the one without there pants on” a correct remark.
1:48 I don’t like being called out like that
Tbh who would watch copyright theory? They could maybe add a nexfix theory instead! All kinds of stuff are on there..but it kinda goes in film theory so…series theory??
Winnie the Pooh when there is no honey
Winnie the Pooh only kills people who steals his honey
Winnie the Pooh on drugs
Ligma in it’s final stages
What that do to Winnie the pooh
the only question that remains for me is "if there different copyright laws in different countries" doesnt this mean that you can get away with all of this if you are a native to a country that allows you to use them without getting sued?
Guys. Does Mickey going into The Public Domain mean we could get SuicideMouse and Abandoned By Disney Movies, or even a remake of Escape From Tommorow?
HOW DO YOU KNOW IM NOT WEARING PANTS WHILE WATCHING THIS
SOME OF US DO HAVE OUT PANTS ON MATPAT (I can't stop watching this YouTube shows [game,food,film,and stole theories])
DID ANYONE SEE THE FOOD THEORY ADD BEFORE THIS?!?!?
how did he know i hade no pants on
I was taking a dump while you said "you walking around without a pants
How did he know i was walking around the house this no pants?? 🤨🤨😐😐
Ok
3:34 I literally gasped
I can hear the sweat that drips from mat’s forehead as he says tigger
Actually sitting alone home pant-less though so..... how dare you?
Map Pat said you without your pants on I literally don't have pants on right now😂😂😂
1:47 yea I don't have my pants on I have my shorts on
@jamesporter9488 1 second ago This video was extremely informative about American copyright law.  In fact, it lead me to wonder things about copyright law that could probably be whole videos of their own.  At least, that's what I thought before I heard your mentioning of how trademark works.  However, maybe there can be something for it after all.  For example, Disney's logo for their flagship studio protects Mickey Mouse by reusing the most iconic scene of Steamboat Willie... but what about the rest of the cartoon?  Since the other scenes aren't used in the branding, could they be the way to skirt the copyright?  There's also how much a company will fight to protect their copyrighted IPs vs. how popular said IP is.  Disney's most popular IP is Mickey Mouse, of course, but he's their third animated character created by Walt Disney.  Walt's first character was Peg Leg Pete (whom we know today as PETE) in the Alice Comedies of the mid-1920s.  And after him was Oswald The Lucky Rabbit in 1927.  You know, that cartoon rabbit that Disney got the legal rights to by trading away A PERSON.  Sure, they used him for the Epic Mickey games, but haven't really used him that much since (despite all the opportunities they had to do so) except for cameo purposes.  As of 2023, Oswald is now a public domain character, and Peg Leg Pete has been in the public domain since 2021 (though given his importance to Mickey, they may not take people trying to use him in their own works all that kindly).  Has/will Disney try to so anything about Oswald, or would they be content to let him drift into everyone's hands?  Also, if you're interested, here's an article of which fictional works have entered the public domain in 2023. https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2023/
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT I SIT AT HOME WITHOUR MY PANTS ON
How did matpat know I didn’t have my pants on? Are you a mind reader Mr pat
Surely someone else here likes epic mickey and wants another game
Dude I was literally on the toilet when he said "you, without your pants on"
How did he know I didn't have pants on?
Thank god he covered why tiger wasn't in the film. I was going insane 😂
I will never tell my kids Disney is great. They will never look at Disney something fun. I've basically told them they are evil like a regular evil corporation
Would you folks rather have the Peter Pan horror movie or a Jake and The Neverland Pirates coming of age/origin film.  BTW Jake and his homies are from St Augustine Florida in the film.
You f*ckers better get used to it…  You’d think I be asking you guys to do this as a joke to break the internet but I’m dead serious about this.  There is actually a serious reason why I want this to happen. Mickey Mouse, Disney's mascot and a symbol of our childhoods is screwed big time. Disney is about to lose the rights to one of my favorite characters because if copyright protection expire, Mickey will enter the public domain in 2024, resulting in sh*tty ripoffs by companies like Paramount, and badly panned horror films that turn the character into bloodthirsty murderers (you guys know what happened to Winnie the Pooh, and I don't even want to talk about THAT).   Because of this, Mickey will no longer be the mascot or the face of Disney, and if you ask me who should replace him, it should be none other than Disney+'s most famous character, Stargirl Caraway. (Yes, there are TWO films which are the most watched things on Disney+ and I'm not even making this up you guys). She's the only real reason we all have Disney's cash cow of a streaming service.  I come from an alternate universe where the duology received a lot more than critical acclaim.  On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% with an average score of 10/10, based on 177 reviews.  At Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film received a score of 100 out of 100 based on 360 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".  Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film the legendary "S+" grade on an A+ to F scale.  Stargirl also won every Oscar and Grammy it was nominated for.  This is the same story for the sequel, and we also got a series of sing along collections from folk music to classic country songs.  The first film is the most watched thing on Disney+ while the sequel is the second most watched.  So everyone spam #StargirlCarawayforDisneysNewMascot  Get this to the CEO and make sure this happens because I'd do anything to get Stargirl into Mickey's spot as the mascot. Social media platform doesn’t matter, what matters is that you do it.   #StargirlCarawayforDisneysNewMascot
Why are people ruining my childhood and various other peoples childhood like they’re literally making a horror movie Winnie the Pooh😢😭 0:10
Winnie the pooh and the bloody bouncer as the next title would be funny
1:47 b-bro how tf did u know
That description of a potential real life mermaid reminds me of the ones from Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. They were beautiful but they could look monstrous and the had really loud shrieks (if I remember correctly)
I would actually like to see smaug x bilbo ( just to see who breaks up first 😂)
This might be a bit of a leap but you know how Disney made that new movie the chip and dale movie....rescue rangers? idk the name but I think they're trying to change the view of the children buy literally making the show about them shutting down bootleg movie studios and showing that they're bad and illegal (well i mean they are now but later not really), and honestly I don't get how this show gets an 80% rotten tomato thingamajigy (I respect the people who like it I just don't really have good fond memory's of rescue rangers sense I'm a youngin' ). also I LOVE YOU FILM THEORY, your not ruining my childhood your making it (:
LEGAL LOOPHOLES 😂
I think this film was actually based on a Lego film I know crazy right
1:49 OMG I'm not wearing 👖
1:46 I had no pants on while I was watching this video😂😂😂
So basically the character in itself is entering the public domain and can be used in any way, but the character is never going to let go of it’s rights and what it is because it has been trademarked so basically Disney isn’t losing the ability to have Mickey as there mascot and have him as a character of fun cartoony imagination that Walt initially intended for him to become, but people will be able to use the character freely without consequences, ok I can handle that, as long as people don’t forget who or what the character actually is at his or her core
11:18 Matpat does a kermit/jordan peterson impression.
nice video learned a lot
Are you going to answer that he literally guess what I’m doing right now 1:46
when i first heard the part about the peter pan and bambi movies, i literally thought it was a joke. nope, they're real things.
All I wanna know is when is sora goin there
Yes they are responsible for visiting the director and saying  ruin it if you do there will be sequals and lots of .....no this cant be natural this can not be the will of the director
I still don't understand copyright
1:46 How did he know??
I just love your videos. I'm playing some games and listening to either The Film Theorist, The Game Theorist or The Food Theorist
Skibidy toilet when
I HAVE PANTS ON
I found this super interesting especially considering I own a MSCHF brand “Famous Mouse” token. It just so happened to bring this exact thing up with some “original artwork” that hasn’t been released as of yet due to copyright.
yo this guy is a psychic or something I'm at home and not wearing pants and he called it
Is it ok to use the “that’s just a theory” phrase
I can't sleep explained pls
How did he know I didn't have my pants on 0-0
Hey where are my credits I asked if u can do this and I have no credit Bruh.
Is it just me or did his voice get deeper while he was talking, then go back?
Was any one actually not wearing pants
1:45  I have my pants on 😢😂
Concepts can't be copyrighted, as you said. So superman's abilities aren't under copyright. He can fly as soon as soon as his name and likeness are freed up.
I Knew Pooh was evil👁️👄👁️
They’re making horror movies out of kids classics Winnie the Pooh, now the grinch, and Mickey Mouse
alot of people tend to forget that disney ripped off alot of stories themselves. Cinderella, little mermaid ALL were someone elses stories.
can I get a trademark for a random monster I made when I was a teen
Update
how did you know i dont have pants on
Matpat: you yes you without your pants on  Me on the toilet: how did he know HOW DID HE KNOW!?!?!?!?
Ji Xingping charachter arcc pov:
🫐🫐🫐🫐 enjoy your meal
Movie idea, Winnie da Poeh. Its about a drug addict bare trying to make it in a bigger company with his friends a pig, owl, and rabbit and get it but Winnie has to hide his heroin in hunny to make it
Disney try to not be completely evil for a few days challenge (impossible)
I always hated public domain. My belief is that it should be available to use the thing after the character/company/creator has been dead or defunct for a few years
The mickey reveal actually shocked me
I don’t agree with the public domain That’s the most politics I am going to text
Trade so in other words Trade marks are being abused by corporations to screw people over? So business as usual
1:48 bro how did he know💀
Corporations can no longer buy politicians and do shady stuff because of the connected world everyone would know etc... yeah well, about that... *points at everything*
Rarely have I ever thought this, despite being on the right side of the political aisle, but go republicans. I'd love to see all these characters finally enter public domain.
F Disney!
Man i wanna see a movie where mickey mouse is a horrific tyrant to everyone
it’s footoferret ayayya 0:07
Hello meep *I never even heard of the Winnie the Pooh movie*
Thanks matpat you've really made me understand about copyrights, trademarks and the public domain. I'm beginning to see how things work just right after you explained them
This movie was hilariously bad
That's why you do Specialman instead of Superman
Moral of the Story? Don't mess with The Mouse. DeSantis found that out the hard way.
I thought he was going to theorise not talk about copyright💀
where did you get that stop sign? it REALLY came in handy this episode Xd
Aye but copying these dweebs is SO LAME. Are people really going to STILL be going on about these same old tedious characters and worlds until the end of time? BORING. Make something NEW...
Dude Peter Pan is already a horror story. People, both his victim children and the audience, can be tricked by him, and his stories of neverland. But he is a demon that lures children away from their parents until they become "lost boys"
i worked for a pizza place called green lantern and they actually beat DC comics in court for the use of the name but we legally are not allowed to wear the green lantern corp. logos while working tho its kinda weird
Matpat. A true one indeed.
how did he know about the pants thing
can u do a theory on goofy's origin ,is goofy a cow or a dog ???????
Imagine that intro if this show was not as family friendly
9:27 LAURENZSIDE?!
so does this mean i can make a movie or mini series where pooh and his pals are puppets and they have wild and wacky adventures searching for honey?
Lol me, not wearing pants.
Steamboat Willie Mickey Mouse is used as a TM, so when it enters the Public Domain, will you still be able to use that character design?
Funny how Democrats want to protect a corporation and are pro-Disney, just so they can "own the R's."
Modern copyright law is a complete and utter joke; it shouldn't even exist, but if it does, it should only extend for 7 years after the work was created (or maybe published)... copyright literally exists to monopolize content by corporations. People need to rally against copyright. it is monopolistic and parasitic. Modern copyright law serves to massively syphon money to corporations from everyone else; it stifles creativity and does the exact opposite of what 'copyright' is supposed to do.
why does the video endlessly buffer at 5:44
Never have i been this jnterested learning about copyright
He should have said member berries another South Park reference like the mickey
the south park part lol
I'm more in shocked with public domain that I don't want to watch entertainment anymore!!!!!!
I did not want to see this happen as notradamous did due to public domain!!!!!
I don't like this I want the world to end if there can be a world war 3
Whether Christopher Robin geowing up and leaving his toy animals to be predators in the movie is not the correct way in disney entertainment!!!!!
This is totally stupid!!!!!
This is a big mistake for winnie the pooh to enter public domain, this movie doesn't even need a happy ending!!!!!
How can I admire it!?
This is totally awful
Am I the only one sort of glad that the trademark can last eternally? I'm someone big on nostalgia and 'original owners' and such, and the idea of, say, watching a superman movie that's not by DC (and not authorised by DC in any way, shape or form) feels sort of weird to me. I don't know, maybe I'm just bad at change, but some part of me was absolutely relieved when I found out that yes, the copyright's gone (or will be gone), but that doesn't mean people will start dishing out whatever.
LMAO [02:50]
I watched this flick today and I am dumbfounded and impressed it exists. Kudos to the filmmakers, and I hope there's a sequel with Tigger, because that guy would be a terrifying adversary!
This man finally got something right.       I don't have my pants on.
intro  was  so  funny
" you gotta get creative with superman"    "Introducing! MUPER-SAN"   "Introducing! A very super man"
" you gotta get creative with superman"    "Introducing! MUPER-SAN"   "Introducing! A very super man"
MatPat saying: "Yes, you sitting at home without your pants". Me: *Sitting at home and not wearing pants* 😳
I saw a advertisement for this once, and i thought it was a joke... Well then.😅
I'm sorry is it just me or Mattpat voice  change at the min 11:22
Wow
How the FCK did he now I wasn't wearing any pants??????????
Would be SIGNIFICANTLY better if  these Disney horror movies were animated in old Disney cartoon style
.-.
My worry is this. I what my cubs to see Care Baers, My Little Pony, Thundercats and He-Man as I remaber them as an cub.  Forexpull my fav raccoon Bigrth Haert form Care Baers running aruond with a criansaw killing everyone he sees; that's just not rigth.
When he said 'u sitting there without u pants on' I was like us he hacking my camera 😮😲
Winnie the Pooh 2: Get Tigger'd
family guy
1:47 “Yes you, sitting at home without your pants on.”  As someone who is watching this at 10 PM at night and doesn’t go to bed with my pants on, I feel so… violated.
I CANT UNSEE THE G IN DISNEY NOW
mat pat there is a theory in roblox of the game called decaying winter  the last strandeds
11:45 China and India can do that.
matpat how did you know I didn’t have pants on
Coffee sizes... Hobbit, Human, v-ENT-é
I feel violated by Matpat calling me out for not having pants, it cotton me off guard...
Am I the only one who feels like there were quite a few places where it sounded like they hired a MatPat impressionist…? Was that an intentional “we have a knock-off Mat this episode ;)” or was he sick or something for those line recordings
I would LOVE to write and direct the peter pan film. Wow does that sound right up my alley. I'd make it a dark "hook" style sequel.
This is making me debate whether the system of public domain is a good thing or a bad thing, because yeah it’s wrong to be super restrictive to someone who just wants to make stuff using the character, but when you take into account all the twisted and cringy stuff that the internet made, as well as this movie in general, you could start to see why it isn’t wrong to be restrictive either
your super WRONG..........IM WEARING shorts but I have been wearing the same underwear for 9 days
I wish the Walt Disney Company would NOT just be called "The Mouse" The character and the corporation are two completely separate entities.
You should do regular Copyright Theory videos, you seem really skilled at making them and they're very interesting.
I have a question what about r34
How do you know I’m not wearing my pants
Matpat the first micky mouse was called plane crazy released in Mar 17, 1929. steam boat willy was the first sound cartoon.
Soon it’ll be hilarious how much we can mess with Disney
Nah cuz this the challenge movie in my class, if we wanna get someone to admit defeat we make them watch this.
Honestly , this movie slaps in the weirdest way?
Bro how Matpat knew I was not wearing any pants.
Okay I'm just watching more of it now mom makes more sense
Animal pretty greedy person like the potato at was so that's two things that other thing that worries me hungry like if I see someone else I have something like your company has Irwin I want them to keep it just not let anyone else use at all
Only thing I'm worried about is like whatever the copyright thing stops or one of the experimenter some and the people start using it for movies and stuff how you know what the Canon or not it'll be pretty difficult
Remember they claim it it's cannon
7:30
Make a yfm theory if matpat reading this doesn’t know what yfm is it’s a cartoon band that started in 2011 and the members are axel benatar deejay and puff puff
Ariel only asked for legs. There's no reason to believe that Ursula would have given her human genitalia. She would probably still reproduce the same way a fish does... Futurama already made the joke.
Oh no, no no no no….. Harley Quinn can’t be allowed to be publicly used
No I haven't seen it & never will.
What about kanga and roo
I laughed so hard at 2:50 in the video
does this mean the fanfiction is now considered canon
I had a nightmare about Tigger having a villainess double it scarred me 😢😂
Movie night be like:bois I think I bought the wrong movie
Awesome theory and this is a nice video to watch today :]
I would watch the peter pan horror movie
Idk if Matt will look into this, but how does AI change or break copyright law?
This movie is a Flop
I had literally just took my pants off when he said “Yes you sitting at home without your pants on”
Learn to love Jesus!!!
100 acre wood battle royale!
Copywrite/trademark laws have simultaniously helped and harmed IPs. I'd say let the free market decide, and I'm a writer. If someone handles my IPs better than me, c'est la vie. Granted, I'm very open about intentions and characterization after the fact (e.g after an original work's publication). But most fanfic is without charge anyways. Regardless, free advertising.
Ngl, I hope for an overflow of terrible movies and IPs just to flood the market and hopefully tank the monopolies of these morally bankrupt companies. A high ask, but a man can dream.
So we all should collaborate ,and pull together the money to buy these public domain entities?!
These are for America right? Cause I don't think that every toy manufacter in my country has a license
How… did he know I didn’t have pants on? MATPAT ARE THERE CAMERAS IN MY HOUSE?!
How did he know I wasn't wearing pants
There was a "superman" horror movie. Brightburn
I was dying when Winnie the Pooh took his suit off and it was Mickey. I really fell out of my chair.😅😊
So if i have a  game idea and i right it down but my friend makes the game ho owns the game me ore him
Not mickey mouse 🐀 anything else I beg you not the best mouse.
Your right I don’t have pants on I have shorts on
My dad genuinely has a friend named Superman yes, superman like the character is that illegal?
How do you know that
how did he know my pant's werent on
Matt Pat :..."yes you sitting at home without your pants on".  Me (sitting at home with no pants on): 😨 *whispers* He knows!
1:46 how do you know??? We’re you spying on me? 😱😱😱
The trademark logo should be trademarked just to make things confusing
Peppa pig is stuk in her room pls mik a  vod pls
Giga brain Disney
thanks for reminding me about worst movie ive watched since jojo rabbit, boy it was terrible, and now to watch matpat
I come here expecting wennie the Pooh horror theory and I left learning bout copyright and trademark ;-;
3:49 From an Italian:Bro,FR!?
That intro is PRICELESS
I came here for a movie not law school
Okay, but now seriously. HOW DID YOU KNOW I WASN'T WEARING ANY PANTS!!
Honestly just wait for disney to fall apart
Matpat could there be a horror Thomas the tank engine movie
Winnie The Pooh made my childhood, I was so sad when I saw an ad for this movie!
I think I’m slow for now getting this. So he really just spits facts and then calls it a theory to cover his tracks from the FBI?
Tell me why he knew I was sitting here with my pants off 😂
There is nothing in society less clear than "LaW"
Copyright/patent trolling make it so only the biggest and richest corporations(nonsense language for "legal" mob) own everything. Sell what you create or have it taken after being buried by legal costs.
i literaly took my pants off right before he said "yes you sitting at home with your pants off"
hmm. Good to know. I gotta tell pahrana and goomba
This is wierd. Theres...................................c..........o.......l.....o.....u.........r.......s?
Learn to love Jesus
Terrible laws but of course it’s Amerika.
Noooooooooooo99oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Noooooooooooo99oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Noooooooooooo99oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Noooooooooooo99oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Is it true that SSI sold Disney their rights to Winnie-the-Pooh, with the agreement that Disney would continue paying SSI some royalties? It is also alleged that Disney also paid royalties to the Pooh Properties Trust, in which some of the money went to Christopher's daughter Clare Milne. Not enough for another video--or is it? 😉
HOW DID U KNOW I DONT HAVE ANY PANTS ON RIGHT NOW
Great video. Did you guys see the new FNAF movie teaser?!
stop this movie was so bad but so funny lmao
how did he know i wasnt wearing pants????
Bro makes a Bendy Movie
you’re telling me MICKEY MOUSE owns the DEATH STAR?
It flopped it’s okay disney will be just fine
Might not be bad for some properties where the people in charge clearly won't listen to fan feedback or desire. Fan-based versions of our favorite characters that do them more justice than the original could also be a thing.
Wait. So then how did South Park use Mickey Mouse without getting sued?
You mentioned "Nostalgia Berries". I couldn't help drawing an analogy (in my mind) with South Park's "Member Berries". But I guess they are about the same thing.
1:47 HOW DID HE KNOW!
I am so grateful we don’t see Eeyore I would break down if I saw him killing people😭😭😭
disney may be sleazy but if i was a big corp like disney, honestly i would do the same thing. winne the pooh horror film is a perfect example, it clearly disturbed a lot of ppl that some lthing as innocent gets twisted. i wouldnt want to see my hardwork turned into something like this
I love how matpat & team have made these videos impossible for Disney to copyright claim unless they want to make it canon that their mascot is a deranged evil kidnapping serial killer.
70 years after the author’s death is ridiculous, works should enter the public domain the moment the author dies, he isn’t going to benefit from it anymore after all.
What about a new Batman from Disney, someday?
This is literally a whole video explaining whay copyright is lol
These people are ruining my childhood but I don't mean you matpat or any of your friends they literally ruined my childhood
6:00 We can assure Game Freak, Nintendo, and Sega are gonna be riding THAT for a LONG TIME
2:44 I doubt that as Disney ain’t letting it’s mascot go
How do he know I'm pantless😮
tigger
Yo Matt patt teaches me a lot of things teachers fail to do i feel like I’m in a more fun school
I have not watched this yet. Lol and I'm not sure I want to. This is creepy.😂
OF COURSE MICKEY MOUSE WAS IN THE INTRO!
I know he was joking about “Copyright Theory” but fr this is stuff I need to know as a creator, please make more of this!
We been hyped for this movie and it did not live up
After Disney's pedo-junk you now come along with horror-junk! Who needs it..... If someone would finally take care of Bret Easton Ellis' "American Psycho" and film it strictly based on the novel - then it would be horror-like.... The visit would then probably be allowed from the age of 99 !
cost 100k wins 3.8m  thats... 38 times the budget  hollywood salivates over such numbers lol
But they cant talk, am I right?
This is going in my favorites folder.  Maybe I'm catastrophizing, but the main thing that I want out of copyright law and things like that is as follows:  *I don't want companies' risk aversion to cross with copyright law in a way that stifles interesting uses of worlds, characters, and stories.*  I know that people can make deals.  I just wish that the power dynamic didn't favor the owners as much as it does - to the point that the offerers are basically making job applications as opposed to a new story.  I probably didn't word this well, all things considered, and I did make this heat-of-the-moment.  Nonetheless, I am glad I watched this video.
I don’t know, some people really care for their own works and would hate to have them redesigned or the plot suddenly turned horror or their characters change genders (which is i guess more prevalent on the fanfic side of things i guess). I mean the original author for winnie the pooh might be dead (i think?) but imagine knowing your works are being made into a horrible horror film.
What about mama roo
I will NEVER watch this as this has RUINED my childhood ever since I heard about it 😭😭
7:34 for the people with subtitles… he’s saying legal
Out of all the theory channels I like the game theorys
The original superman actually seemed cool
Marist has a grudge against Nicky mouse
This is just fanfiction.  I don't need to wait for IPs to expire to write those. :)
11:14 Did MatPat get a cold or something all of a sudden? His voice sounds weirdly different here. 11:55 And then it stopped sounding weird. WTHeck? ….I don’t think it is but it sound like some ai stuff that I’ve listened to.
Are you going to do a theory on the next Godzilla movie you nailed it the last time
Where there's a will, there's a way. Internet taught me that.
How did you know 1:48
You didn't need to point out I wasn't wearing pants....
Oh trademarks can expire just gotta wait for the apocalypse
Disney's worst fear is making good movies again

Bruh it's golden freedy
Absolutely nobody here has commented about how some weird guys actually made a Winnie the pooh horror movie                                                                                                                                           Keep going.......

HOW DOSE HE KNOW I DONT HAVE MY PANTS ON?! 💀
Mickey Mouse will make an epic serial killer.
I love the Kingdom Hearts references in this video. Great job MattPat, never thought you could do that! Combined two of my favorite worlds 🥹🥹
17:54  Bro this is the first time film theory made a the boys reference.
This is just wrong! The company has taken away something that’s not meant for kids.
If you want to distinguish Mickey, just take the buttons off his pants, or put four buttons instead of two. Make the tips of his shoes flatter or pointier or whatever. They never change Mickey’s clothes so if you mix up the clothes it isn’t Disney’s Mickey anymore. Their Mickey only ever has the single outfit. Or just stick to fanfics and fan art and upload them to FanFiction or DeviantArt.
Did anyone else hear Mat’s voice pitch downward partway through the video?? Or am i just hearing things???
no way jining ping got his own film theory video
HOW DID HE KNOW I HAD NO PANTS ON?
I do not support crappy offbrand horror movies. The only horror movie I would support is the Peter Pan one (because he was a psychopath in the book) and a horror version of Jurassic Park (again, the original book).
11:14 WHY DOES MATPAT SUDDENLY SOUND LIKE BARNEY😭
Does matpats voice sound off?
1:48 how did you know

Hello Matpat, have you seen the smile tapes?
1:48 I'm literally in a dress without pants! lol😂😂
Hm, I see, how very interesting, these next years are going to be very interesting, I hope we’ll get to see something great from this, regardless of the Copyright and Trademarks, ‘cause I have learned that there are a lot curative people out there and I would be very fascinated to see if they will shine through.
Jokes on you MattPat I do have my  pants on

I just had this messed up dream last night, it was about that Bambi horror movie they're making, I think I just predicted both the plot and ending expect I was actually in the movie, but not as an actor if you know what I mean, when that comes out you guys will laugh at its absurdity, but for me, when you live through something like that without it just being a movie, it's terrifying
Isnt matpat should be like idk sued for this
how he knew i had no pants
With all the characters becoming public domain it might as well be communism.
I wanna destroy every one who thinks that turning childhood of bilions to horror
Well now we can see tiger malling people's neck

What are the odds they'll just pass another law to stop Mickey from entering public domain
Hi
I’m kinda scared. How did you know I had my pants off.
2:46 its the best part
imagine when mickey enters public domain, that disney FINALLY has to use oswald
Awesome! 👍
it feels weird when some says "yes you you sitting ar ur home without ur PANTS"
This video is 85% Abt copyright
So, im curious. Can a company that own a copyright to a character, resubmit that exact character to trademark?  If so, then superman could trademark his first comic and turn it into brand. Maybe like disney, a flipping comic book of the first issue of superman
so you could kinda rip-off superman if you changed the name, font, and logo for him? like- basically, all this means you can fiddle with the CONCEPTS from the ORIGINAL/FIRST editions of characters and such? or did i miss something-
Demon Slayer episode😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😈

2:04 Avatar: The Way of Pooh😂
Yeah this movie is Almost not watchable
Im going to cry
Wait disney is copyrighted does this mean someone could buy it???
how about the "The Mean One" can you make a video about that???
This reminds me of Hasbro's relationship with the word 'transform'. You'll notice in most of the recent toy packaging and instructions, they advertise that the figure "converts in X number of steps" because if they overuse the word 'transform' it will become generic and allow other companies to sell 'transformers' toys instead if 'transforming robot toys'

Mat is so smart he passed the IQ test
Disney's worst nightmare is the public domain.
I love film theory also never trust Mario see the 2 theory.
I say Mickey the horror movie should take place on the abandoned treasure

Well to solve this, we need a new president that will change the law,
Well winnie the pooh doesnt protected by copyright, sorry, knockoffs
How you know I have no pants on
So this videos tell me that you're ready to tackle the move Ready Player One. And how it will never happen right?
Your Disney count of death is off because you also don't have to include in Star Wars movies... You can just go ahead and label that series as the deadliest series we won't blame you. Or is it the mcu
Funnily enough Trade marks have to be submitted to different countries by a company to keep it in that country. Burger King as most of us know it is called Hungry Jacks in Australia because an independent business trade marked Burger King there. I don't know how far this goes around the world or if there are other examples of this happening but I think it's a neat piece of trivia I learnt thanks to my buddies from Australia
3:52 I'm from 2 of those country's Canada and 🇮🇹
Movie sucked anyways
In China, Winnie the Pooh is illegal. Would this movie be too?
It's so sh*ty that Disney tries so hard to make sure no one copies them, even though everything they create is based on other people's work.
We need trademarks reform
how did he now i had no pants?
Okay, matpat has mind reading…. HOW U KNOW I DONT HAVE PANTS ON…….????

not-so-fun fact! the terrible pooh slasher flick was set to premiere in hong kong but it was cancelled abruptly “due to technical issues” and the organiser has no plans to actually premiere it technical issues, of course, definitely not because pooh has become a politically sensitive symbol😃

What about semantic shift?
Quick bit, there's a Paraguayan company named Mickey which has been using mickey as their mascot for decades now, even beating Disney in a lawsuit... Check it out, funny stuff
Remember folks, Disney is an entertainment-based company. Don't wanna support em? Still wanna watch em? Pirate em.

SUPERDUDE
Question regarding the original concept of Superman: Since only the original iteration of Superman will enter the public domain, could you then collect and compile publically known facts about Seigal and Schuster to create a biographical film regarding the development and creation of Superman as a comic book character?
You should cover the grinch horror movie
DC attempted to sue a Chilean sandwich shop for the name "Superpan"... DC lost that lawsuit. Also I know of a furry author by the name of Bernard Doove (aka Chakat Goldfur) who got away with using the Caitians and Starfleet from Star Trek fame in their stories that they've published and sold online after a legal battle with Paramount, iirc. Sadly I don't remember the exacts of the latter case, but it's amazing how the slightest changes to an established work can make something technically yours. Huh...guess all those "This is my Sonic OC, Blonic: do not steal" jokes have more of a point, than I thought... ;)
So wait just so I understand things here. So someone can just sell the Hobbit book again that isnt Tolkien or certified publishers? Since the book has been the book since it came out. No changes have been made to the book since it came out like you could with the cartoons and comics.
Have you heard about the new Disney trading card game? Do you think that is part of this?
Thanks for the vids Mattpat
Hi matpat
Anyone one else think a Superman film without the cheesy S on the chest or the x-ray vision or the tights or the invulnerability would be *WAY* better?
11:14 what happened to your voice here?.
Lol
PLEASE MATPAT DO LOFI GIRL SHES MISSING AND THE LIVE KEEPS GETTING CLOSER TO THE RANDOM BLUE LIGHT ROOM IF YOU ACCEPT THIS THEORY CHALLENGE I WIL BE SO HAPPY !
FREAK YOU MAT, YOU HAVE A FREAKING DEMON THIRD EYE!!! I JUST CAME HOME FROM CLASS AND LAYED IN BED AND I JUST REMOVED MY JEANS!!!     1:48
i would actully be exited i there was a copyrght theory
I would do it in animated because it’s better then having people in costumes
No off matpat, but at 11:18 you started to sound like Kermit ngl
So Mickey Mouse is or will be protected by trademark but what does that mean for other characters from Steamboat Willies like Minnie Mouse and Pete? Will they be easier to use than Mickey Mouse?
How did you know I didn’t have pants on 🤨
The original Superman powers were so much better than the current ones which essentially made him a god. When you have a superhero that is virtually impossible to defeat, it makes the hero much less interesting.
Poppy playtime mob can literally make a better version of this. I still remember box creature eating an employee being a high detailed clip
Winnie just wanted his honey
This might actually explain why they're doing all these live action remakes.  A means to maintain rights to their versions of these characters.
11:15 is it just me or does he sound like kermit

12:01 There is no way Disney can copyright Darth Vader breathing. It is literally just SCUBA gear noises.
They had a chance to name it "Winnie Pooh: Taken a 2"
This is interesting, BUT the film is just meant to be a lazy cash grab I mean they didn't even design Pooh in the movie, they bought it from some website
Oh they are absolutely going to make the sequel Pooh Horror be about Tigger
Probably not related at all to this but when watching this video my pc bluescreened for the first time in like 5 years
Could you make a video about The Banana Splits movie on April 13th please film Theory😢😢😢😢😢
Matpat: yes you sitting at home without your pants on Me knowing I'm in a robe with no pants on: 😃
I still have the theorie that if ted was made today the bear would be winnie pooh
This video remind me with 3moory

It’s ironic considering how Disney got its start by using public domain characters and stories. For all the FilmBros who care about “originality” will be very surprised to see how everything is a copy or retelling of something else.
How did he know I had no pants on??🤔
If text stlye means copyright then do you get copyright
MatPat: Yes you without your pants on Me: HOW DO YOU KNOW I DNO’T HAVE PANTS ON!?
Murder drones
Thank you, now i understand why thesis being plagiarism😅
1:43 HOW DO YOU KNOW?
Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. (2003)   Provides precedent for the attempt to use trademarks to block the use of works which have entered the public domain to be struck down. While it doesn’t directly address the issues that arise discussed here the decision did include direct statements against the use of the Lanham Act (which established the basis for US trademark law), to hinder the use of public domain works.  This case was in regard to “reverse passing off”, where Dastar took a public domain film and presented and sold it as though they had produced it.   The best evidence that this precedent would be applied to a case involving these new public domain entities is Scalia’s statement that ruling in favor of Fox would serve,   "to create a species of mutant copyright law that limits the public's 'federal right to "copy and to use"' expired copyrights,"  and that it would create “a species of perpetual patent and copyright, which Congress may not do,”.    The most significant part of this ruling is the note that Congress may not make a species of perpetual copy right and patent protection. Which derives from the fact that the Constitution specifically only grants Congress the ability to secure IP rights for limited times. As such, and as is stated in the ruling, more weight has to be given to the free use of public domain works than trademark protections.
Dude just imagine in the next year we're gonna see Micky mouse with harry Potter doing some John wick stuff .
Solution super duper man
Me before this video: *watches SHEIN theory* The ad on this video: *MAKE YOUR OWN STYLE* *SHEIN*
Hey matpat! What about the parody stuff? If I remember right, in the US you can “use” these trademarked things if you present it as a parody. Examples would be weird Al and fan fictions. Still using the same music and stories and characters, but it’s a parody because there’s a “twist” in it of some kind making it slightly different than the original.
I hated this movie
Hey… in the future do you think you could do a “Mystery Skulls” Theory? The one by “mysteryBen27”

So are we going to see the same movies our whole entire lives just because filmmakers have become too lazy and uncreative to come up with something new? :(  they’re just taking advantage of dead authors
I like the idea that a reupload only gets 20 so views.  I have seen many re-uploads that are on the upwards of millions while the OG upload has 20 sum thousand.   I am not saying this isnt accurate, but that more often than not - a reupload gets a ton of views because they've simply added the "know your meme" title to the tags/title etc

Me seriously trying to figure out how MatPat  knew i didnt have pants on
am i the only one who doesn't just get that movie....the vibe its giving me is KILLING me, YUCK!
:)
A Peter Pan horror room actually makes sense because Peter Pan is arguably the villain there. Captain Hook may not be fully innocent, but Peter Pan isn't much better.
Um is it bad I'm on the big companies side on this one? I mean like why would you want someone else using your own creation and changing as much as they can with it? I'm sorry Matpat but if I wanted to make my own company I would do the exact same as Disney. And plus what's the fun of using someone else's creation when you can make your own?
I hate that his stupid movie comes up every time I want to put one of my sons favourite movies on. Want to block it for showing up on my fire tv
Cof cof brightburn
Where does parody come into it?  Can I use any of theses works if I prefix it using the word "Dumb"?
in my opinion this is a very good thing
Is that man in smallville he didn’t really wear the costume or really call himself Superman
Honestly I think the peterpan one would be a banger
How to beat winne the pooh step one put honey everywhere
The pooh is after you
Disney attempting to secure the original Mickey amidst the impending doom is akin to someone protecting their ear while vultures are picking off the flesh right off their bones. In other words, good luck with that LUL
Pooh never had any trademark iasues and people still knew about which character the movie was, so any attempt to downplay this opportunity to feast of Disney content is pointless. I , for one,am very happy thinking they're angry over losing 3 million dollars as soon as Pooh entered the public domain
How did u know im not wearing pants👁👄👁💀
Just a recommendation but I think mat should make a theory on the underrated analog horror ‘vita carnis’ about how and why the “creatures” exist
But bro literally just goes 😐🫱 and that kills people
Me and my friend went to see this, and it was… interesting to say the least. It was mostly just gore and brutal death scenes. The acting and plot was horrible, but the murder scenes were traumatizing-
Bro I was legit in the bathroom takin’ a dump when matpat called me out!

My birthday is January 5
I'm kinda curious. Aren't skirting around legalities like this just hurts the companies? At some point in the future, there might be some many Mickey's, eventually Mickey is just a mouse with a name, and Disney would have to let go of the name. It's the same problem Google is facing because people use Google so much, it starts to be considered legalizing googling as a verb, not exclusive to Google.
I KNEW IT!!! DISNEY INTRODUCING THE OLD MICKEY DESIGN INTO THE *WDAS* LOGO WASN'T JUST FOR "NOSTALGIA"!!!

How did he know I didn't have my pants on? 🤨
The scariest thing of all matpat... Is... Is how did you know that my pants ... They were not on.... This is far more creepy... Forget Pooh and legal talk 😭😭😭😭 but 😅 anyway...  MatPat and gang... Love ya lol ❤
Just saw John Oliver do this exact thing!
Please tell me I'm not going insane, does it sound to anyone else like MatPat's voice changes in sections of the voiceover?
That is a lot of years 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
yes it's joe
At this point people just want something different

Can I still make a fan fnaf book? Bc i worked hard on the book im wrighting now
But ive been seeing different interpretations of these characters on the internet for decades.....
MatPat! What's you're take on John Oliver using Mickey Mouse in his most recent episode of Last Week Tonight (aired 4/2/2023)??? He made the argument that Steam Boat Willie could be associated with his brand as they've had him in their intro for the entire season! It's definitely extremely risky but so enticingly promising!!!  Side note, seems like I'm the first person to comment about this on this video!
I bet someone’s gonna make a bendy like movie for a Micky horror film and also this is good since the trademark actually limit’s the use for the IP and also so it doesn’t break films and he’ll it actually leads to other creativity
That aint winnie the pooh, this S’hits a F’king winner da poo.
LAW THEORY CHANNEL WHEN???
Imagine they make mouse.avi movie or  abandoned by Disney movie
Since when was pooh an avatar?
I feel like the Public Domain parts were foreshadowed in SheHulk when there were a bunch of legal battles about trademarking words themselves
I threw this on one night for a laugh with my wife...we couldn't finish it, this movie was the single worst film I've ever seen  edit: time to get started on my script for "The-Bat-Man-Who-Totally-Kills" Take that DC hahahahahahahaha
How, how did you do that, tmi but I’m taking a whole poo right now (no pun intended) and you knew my pants weren’t on how did you do it
Can’t you just call Superman “the man of steel”?
Oh my god it’s xi jinping
1:47 im genuinley scared because im not wearing pants rn is matpat out my window or somthin

1:48 HOW DID HE KNOW-
"You sitting at home without your pants on." HOW DID HE KNOW
I think someone working on Last Week Tonight is a theorist. Tonight's final segment is on intellectual property and is featuring the horror pooh movie trailer. 😂
matpat please call it corruption , lobbying is corruption and bribing and telling people that will start the change we need
when he said " yea you without your pants on " I wasn't wearing pants
Do a unicorn war’s  theory
Finally there doing something darker no more happy ending 😂😂😂😂
I think you might have a mild mistake in your concept of trademark. You're correct about what it covers, but then you're talking about it as if it granted the same protections as copyright -- and it doesn't.  The trademark on the Superman shield, for example, means you can't use it in a way that would make consumers believe that your product comes from DC. This doesn't mean you can't still put it on Supe's chest, because the graphic itself isn't copyrighted. It means you have to be careful in the ways you use it to promote your work. Putting it proudly in the cover art to catch the consumer's eye is going to be an issue -- but you also can't use the name "Superman" or any confusingly similar variation in that kind of placement either.  So... Your PD Superman comic book would just leave the character's name out of the title. The art would focus on the original material you've created, not on the stuff you copied. People should know at a glance that this is an original work by an independent creator not affiliated with DC.  If you do that? Once you're inside the book instead of in the marketing materials, you can use whatever you want from the original now-public-domain comic.
I want someone to make a cartoon of Ron DeSantos sexually assaulting the original Mickey Mouse, just as a FU to Disney😂
the Disney horror movies kinda represent the companies corrupt state
Question!  If DC is so insistent on keeping Superman as one of their quality resources, why haven’t they made a good Superman movie?
Why does whinnie sound like Kronk?
Why are you useing so many ace atorny refrences, and keep on putting Pheonix Right?
You have got to do some fosters home for imaginary friends theory’s please 🙏
Disney, rips off the public domain for their own profit, expands copyright to increase how long they can profit off it for without it entering the public domain, gets terrified that their expansion from 28 years to 100 will finally end.  Burn Disney burn
Horror superman already exist is called Brightburn,
"lot of free time on our hands" bro has 4 theory channels and 1 gaming channel and he says he has a lot of free time💀
Can you do some theories  about Ninjago?
remember the Fine Bros?
Wow no joke when he said “sitting at your home without pants on” lol😂
Like, you know that the first Paddington Bear story was published in 1958 and has been a beloved icon of British children's literature ever since and isn't a modern rip off of Pooh Bear right? I mean because it seems like maybe you don't...   We also have Rupert the Bear and Sooty honestly, you want bears for kids, we got 'em!
Better matpat watched CPG greys video for this
umm no fair use lets us use them in none profit forms anytime you want lol no they can't that is a voilation of free speech and the vader sound is literly just a diver suite guess i nee to mute my diving video when i go on vacation don't want to get juceabused by a evil greedy corporation lol
What with matpats rivarly with Mickey mouse lol.
17:25 that's my exact thoughts
Hah! I'm shirtless not pantless,  nice try matpat!
Kinda sad you didn't talk about the popular "Mickey Mouse" key chain from South korea. The last time mickey was supposed to enter the public domain, a company came out with a blank mouse that looked like mickey. It was simple but a great work around
1:50 I'm standing around without my pants on
So Invincible's Omniman is literally the OG Superman (+flight).
I thought Sherlok Holms was already public domain. So many stories, movies, and shows a out him at one time.
11:10 matpat turned into kermit while explain ING copyright lmao
1:49 …..i really have no pants on too
1:49 …..i really have no pants on too
Can you talk about the grinch horror movie
"Yes you, sitting at home without your pants on"  How did he know?!
1:48 HOW DID HE KNOW IM LYING IN BED WITH INLY UNDERWEAR!?!!!!
God things are changing a lot 😢
I screamed when I heard Sherlock entered the public domain….I have a problem
1:19 is that the deer from evil dead mat pat?
Bloodie dé’ poõh
ok so I'm starting to think Mat can see me through the screen (how did you know I wasn't wearing pants you phyci-
Winnie Pooh Sheisty
Game Theory versus Five Nights at Freddy's movie
Gotta give it to Disney - Trademarking literal frames of animation was genius
While the first Superman comics go into the public domain in 2033, the Superman animated shorts from the 1940s have been public domain for quite a while now (due to the rights-holders failing to file the necessary paperwork to extend their copyright back when that was required) and many of the iconic aspects of the character, such as flight, were introduced there. Many other aspects (such as Kryptonite) were introduced in the 1940s radio series, although I don't know what its copyright status is.  At any rate, once the actual character of Superman goes into the public domain people are going to have a lot to work with.
So, we're gonna make 'Suder-man' (based on a street in Antwerp, where some funny ppl have been changing the 'D' for fun, since ages, until it resembles a P, the 'S' on the shield wil be reversed, until it looks like a '5' & instead of red, we make it blue... btw, to make multiple companies mad, let's use the  'D' from Disney, that resembles a 'G' (like stated in the video) & call it 'Gisney', but in 'Comic Sans' lettertype :p
11:45 Probably just me. Voice seemed… different. Reminds me of that AI narration idea MatPat had. Hmm. Maybe
I was sitting watching, and when matpat said "You, sitting without your pants on" I looked at my screen so weird
How does he know I’m pantless?
Plot twist Disney is making these horror movies under a false name
We just wait for 5 years and there will be one cinematic universe just with all the cartoon characters. WHY DO THEY HAVE TO RUIN EVERY CHILDHOD!?
Someone should make a superman movie but have it be very vague
"You better belive it, haha" Bro I was dying after that 💀
i actually have my pants on MAT PAT!
how did matpat know i had no pants wtf?
If there's one thing the world needs, it's more lawyers.....can you imagine a world without them?
Matpat is the only person who can convince me I’m a crayon and I’d believe it wholeheartedly.
Honestly, as a new creator, this terrifies me, as I have a serious trigger and paranoia about people taking my dedicated work and creations, and the fact I can lose all of it and it be possibly warped is truly horrifying
All hail matpat the theory king 👑
Personally, I hope that ALL of Disney's big money makers end up in the public domain, especially Marvel and Star Wars (I know, I know, won't happen... YET). Disney has gone from family friendly entertainment company to blatant propaganda and public narrative driving bullshit machine. Disney can't die fast enough.
Look at how they massacred my boy (literally)
Oh yeah. I actually checked when Mickey Mouse would enter Public Domain last year. I thought about making Mickey Mouse merchandise and selling it.
There's only one problem with this theory>  No, that's a lie. There's a lot wrong with it.  First of all, about the only thing copywritten in this theory is Matpat's own cutout and voice (likeness). Everything else is a fact, and a derivation of a fact. And facts *cannot* be copywritten. Trivia experts might know of Worth vs Trivial Pursuit regarding Columbo's first name. If they can get it from multiple sources, it's a fact. And just extrapolating facts to form theories doesn't make it immune. (Have you consider trademarking "That's just a theory", by the way?)  Also, adding small details (such as extrapolating "More powerful than a locomotive" into Superstrength) isn't going to pass muster either, witness the Estate of Conan Doyle vs Enola Holmes. While specific stories can't be reprinted as Public Domain until they pass the due date, the character itself under open season the moment the origin passes by (that said, MatPat is almost certainly correct about Tigger... but not about Pooh Bear's shirt. Clothing, as noted in a recent style theory, is not copyrightable.)  Finally trademark is generally only applicable for static images - or very specific animations ("Steamboat Piloting Mickey, Whistling" is probably trademarked. No other version of the Mouse is). And yes, the Superman *logo* is trademarked because it's in a very specific font. Outside that font, it's fair game. Same goes for the S. Put it in a circle or a square, and it's clearly not infringing.   By law, it must be, quote: "a recognizable sign, design, or expression".   Those dashes, by the way, change nothing.  Oh. Mat was right about one other thing.... I'm not a lawyer. Just an absolute trivia nerd with way too much time on his hands.
So does the curse of public domain only plague major corporations or all content creators?
Why does copyright last longer for corporate entities? Who decided a company has more priority and say so over an individual creator?
Disney cares far less about this than it does about promoting moral debauchery, s*xualizing kids, and virtue signaling sociopolitics.
How the F did you know in not wearing pants
around 5 minutes in, theres some background noise thats really distracting, more specificly its abruptly ending and starting back up, its sounds like a escalating tone.
The pooh fast and furious X will come or sooner than expected 😂😂😂
Mat Pat, I was not wearing pants. I'm very scared you are watching me. plz stop.
there is another version of superman in the DC universe called Ultraman, with a U logo. thats one way around the superman trademarks.
Man that's in my top 10 bad funny horror movies
Why do I keep screaming stop putting the prototype in this?
omg i just watched this six days ago!! what a coincidence!
The 100 acre wood looking really unsettling right about now
Please do a vid on the Monument Mythos! #2
Xi jinping
this just doesn't matter just too much these days look at homelander a clear superman clone is more popular in recent years
I agree with sinister studios
Who noticed that the Pooh and the mouse are foafy
Kachaw
Can I use this Company: yes but no
What's really scary is that I was watching this while changing and when Mathew Pathew said "Yes you with no pants on" I had just taken my pants off so it was some really good timing on his part. But that's just a theory. Right?
heyy! how did you know I had no pants of are you stalking us
Excuse me, I am actually STANDING without my pants on.
you Just ruined my childhood WHY IS THIS A THING
I love it
4:11 coems🤑
08:59 Hardest Trigger i have ever heard
Yes
how did you know i dont have pants on😢😢
but i can still make superman x winnie the pooh fan fiction right ?
stupid cartoons
The fact i was watching this with no pants on, scares me.
Hey Matthew take down your theories about content it's putting people Like VivziePop in heat with COPPA
for the intro: HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHA
Now I need to see a theory on parody and free use law. Companies seem to forget that those are protected all the time.
1:47 oh COME ON Mattpats theorist senses have become too strong
The life of luxury monster! Friendo
-> Maybe We're The 1st Spiritist* Pop-Metal Or Rock Band In This World 🤔  -> ❤ But Don't Pay Much Attention To Our Neanderthal English, Ha Ha Ha  *NOTE: -> Spiritist is who professes Spiritism, the Gospel continuation It has began with the books by Allan Kardec and continued in the books by Francisco C. Xavier, the greatest and more important medium/prophet of spirits of the last centuries... _
Day 2 of me requesting a theory on God Friended Me.
With the way it can be so tricky to use Superman we’re better off being creative and come up with our own new superheroes
Bruh I’m a big fan of Pooh bear (mostly the old versions, not the newer versions of him) my heart can’t take this Omg stop
Applause on a very entertaining and informative video. For one thing I never knew that the ® referred to an unregistered trademark. And now, can someone explain to me why the trademark icon (™) on YouTube's comments keyboard is so huge instead of tiny and made to scrunch up in the top right corner like I want it to be?  BTW, I take it that the recent Banana Splits slasher movie, unlike Pooh B&H, was a simple result of the copyright to S&M Krofft's distinctly-less-beloved characters being dirt cheap to license? Seriously, who among you can name all four of the Splits right now without turning to Google?*   *(Hint: None of them are named "Google".)
peter pan horror movie is giving me chills like if you think about how does peter pan remain youthful and he constantly abduct- i mean peter pan invites children to neverland.
make a video on liminal land
Then there’s dreamworks 😂
Hey matpat have you heard a 1970 TV show called welcome home it is a puppet show some were killed
Pretty sure Disney's worst nightmare is their own fans. At least, based on how they act.
legal theory channel?
Sounds like Matt Pat's opening a new channel called law theory.
What happens if you make something and take the credit for it, but don’t trademark it and/or copyright it and then someone gets that same idea and copyrights and trademarks it? Would you still get sued or have to go to court?
God I can't wait for HP to be public domain... lmao anyone else?
In other words, A big middle finger to Disney with an actual win. Stick it to the rat!
Like Oswald the lucky the rabbit
The nightmare of anyone : Trademarks, Copy write and - Legal issues
There will be workarounds. People wont allow stuff to get altered so freqently to forever evade public domain
I don't think that anyone can do more damage to the Woke Mouse's IP than they have already done themselves.
What about Oswald the lucky rabbit in trolly trouble? Is his trademark forever??????
1:49 HOW DID HE KNOW
To think Disney's aggressive manipulation of Copywrite  could be traced back to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit being legally stolen from Walt Disney so long ago.
1:48 caught me in 4k
I wish Disney hadn't ruined copyright, it was 56 years before they messed it up the last time. That's plenty of time for the creator to make a profit off their work.  If that was still in place, some of the original Star Trek as well as a lot of Beatles music would be public domain now as well as a ton of Alfred Hitchcock movies. Many superheroes and a good chunk of their lore would be available too. Stuff people actually still care about would be able to be played with vs stuff that's a century old now. I mean how many stories from 100 years ago do people really care about enough anymore to the point where they would want to expand on them? Granted the 1930's is about where modern pop culture started to begin in my opinion so we are starting to reach that.  The real fun would have begun about a decade from now though when aspects of Star Wars would have started entering the public domain and soon many 80's movies like Ghostbusters and Back to the Future would follow.  Millennials would even eventually get to make their own Pokemon game with the older Pokemon within their lifetimes. That won't happen with our current system though.
The thumbnail made me think this was another fnaf-like theory.
Tarzan has been like this for a while, I'm no lawyer but from my understanding you could make a rip off of him using the exact original stories and everything and be fine but you couldn't actually call him Tarzan without permission as he's trademarked.
For my Communications Course, our Final is going to be us giving a speech for 4-6 minutes on a topic of our choosing. This video has influenced me to begin putting together a speech on Copyright and Trademarks. I have to use other sources such as my University's online library and EBSCOHOST, but the idea for the speech and some of the information will stem from this video. All because I love both the idea of Winnie the Pooh becoming a vicious murderer and the Theory Channels. Thanks, MatPat and Team!
Remember that American laws ONLY apply in the U.S. and/or to U.S. citizens. Don’t let these corporations put fear ibto your heart if you live in the rest of the world where freedom still exists.
yeah are copyright laws are so fucked because disney keeps changing laws to reuse ips
I forgot that was even being made, need to check it out now that it's out to spite disney
Sorry never mind it just got answered
But can you use super man not Superman
I watched it and I couldn't stop laughing.
disney can no longer run from the public domain BEWARE
Heyyy… i have pants on nowww…
*WE NEED AVATAR THE WAY OF POOH*
Actually i have no shirt on
Please don’t make me relearn what I learned about copyright in intro to music class
I think sapermun is better than superman
11:10 11:18 err
Day 33: of asking for a theory on sevenundersouls
2:48 UM
Matpat I have a special theory for you You must discover the secret of kennys immortality from South Park you well love the lore of that theory and you MUST do that theory or else I'll turn you into a furry
This reminds me of the scp video you did and I always wondered what you would react with from the Winnie movie
😢 I liked it when he was a kind bear and how did you know I was at home without my pants on watching your vid 😅
I know you did an episode on Hazbin Hotel, but please do one on Helluva Boss too!
what an odd yet creative world we live in where thanks to tik tok and fortnite crossovers and revisons of copyrighted materials both are all the rage and get shut down fast.   this was very interesting, i'm forwarding this video to my marketing class  .
Next film Theary video: who killed the fnf logic franchise?
Hey, all of this still tells me I can use the names John Watson and Sherlock Holmes to publish the remix romance “My Dear Watson: A Mystery of the Heart”
😂 ur vids are always funny  👍
Ey Nintendo ya good? sure youu are so... *when does marios copyright expire?* *_THE ANSWER IS 2080_*
Could we get a Video on "The Menu"? I would love to see MatPat dissect the psychology of  Julian Slowik or the meaning behind the ending.
The fnaf movie plz I am so excited
I think that the person who came up w the idea of ruining most peoples child hood favorite shows is extremely dumb 😂
Can you please make a video about unicorn wars
Tbh it could be fun to make a slasher take on The Mouse and see if you could get away with it. In seriousness are there anyone who could be interested in making such a movie? I have a few short stories published in my native languages so far, so i have some experience with writing and dream to write movies. :)
I loved the theory ty matpat ❤
I don't have my pance on 💀
Now im gonna wait for the lore take on this movie
Did you even do your research matt?!?! You didn't say "think, think, think!" one time in this... So many missed opportunities here.. Oh bother...
How did he know I had np pants 😮😮
0:05 your wrong i actually can do this because I have “50 million power in rise of kingdoms”
This is why Marvel show all their super Heroes in their logo on movie?
Umm… how did you know I didn’t have pants on… why does it look like MatPat is outside my window. 😅
i'm not waiting anymore, matpat needs to make a murder drones theory NOW
The mindscape is open to all but is it safe for us to delve into something essential for us.
The fued of matpat and Mickey mouse has returned
Dear film Theory i have a question and a idea. When i am scrolling trough shorts some times there arbers justice leaque or family guy or breaking bad, as i see it it don't go into fair use so it is illegal
1:47 how did he know
Now someone or a group will be waiting at the patent office 1st thing the day before it expires waiting to go in and get their IP/s for movies media and merch! put an alarm for 3 days before schedule the week off and pack a cooler and a catheter and some blankets and weapons to protect yourself.
Disney's worst nightmare is DreamWorks
Imma just put my opinion out there. I hate this movie.
@Onigiri_Cat Happy Child
FILM THEORY PLS DO THE HAPPY CHILD PLSSSSSSSSSS
There's an issue with this video on my end: This video stops at 5:43 while the picture pauses a few seconds earlier. No matter what I do, the video won't play beyond that point. Sure I can click ahead to the 5:47 mark and it plays normally, it's just annoying having a video run into this issue that ruins a smooth run of watching the video.
how did he know i had no pants on....
Is it just me or does mat's voice sound funny?
I feel like a whole new horror movie series would be made about Disney Characters by the same company.
Hey MatPat, just want to let you know there’s a NEW arg, called ‘Welcome Home’. It was made by creator NightMind, and it’s probably too early to theorise about. It has one episode so far, as well as a current live stream. I think it’s worth checking out though.
Hey film theory could you do a theory on Rapunzil again but on the show?
Matpat, you should make a theory about Luigi's Mansion where he actually is a murderess psycho who kills everybody and that is why there are so many ghosts. And he is thinking he's a good person and try to save his friends, which is why they are in paintings. The paintings are actually the dead bodies of his friends and hallucinations are involved. But that's just a theory!
11:33 “yeah backwards gisney movie”
Come on now, I really feel called out, was in the middle of taking my pants of and he said it. You share your shower in Style Theory MatPat, I don’t share my room! I’m watching you 👀
If there were a horror movie based on Peter pan or mickey mouse; I would not be surprised at all the horror of them might be their real selves especially after watching once upon a time series twice and watching a video about mickey mouse as a character.
bro plese make a vid about pokeferlax and spread the word His channel is being take down and it is very wrong He is a very good person and whats happening with him should not happen He is anipoke youtuber and the compony that makes the anime ShoPro is taking him down while he only uses still images which are under fair use So i beg u to help this man out I know u can make a big difference and i know u would like to help him out sp please just please
Lol 😂
I can see both sides but I also don't think they should sneak and trademark mickey like that especially since he's not used in shows anymore. This also means they trademark Tinkerbell to because I've seen her in the animation logos to. I think it's unfair to the public though.
I can't wait for mickey steam boat massacre...
Do one about the show vama please please make 1 about the vama🥺🥺🥺🥺 I lost 2 and a 1/2 episodes of the so please make one of the show please I'm begging you please Matt Pat please love you're content your content is amazing perfect contand thank you for your time
1:47 how did you know i did not have pants on
I have never heard of such horror movie; if there is; It  seems downright wrong to rip off a lovable Disney toy character as a horror movie villain.
I have pants on, how dare you! Good video tho, keep it up
I know this is old but can you do something about hoppers backstory from bugs life bc that sounds really interesting
Film theory idea:is the light Saber really made of light?
The worst part is that Disney didn't even create Pooh, Milne did. Disney has a history of stealing other people's copyright-expired public-domain works then copyrighting and trademarking them, then trying to convince everybody its their IP, and going out of its way to prevent anyone else from doing to Disney what Disney did to others by bribing politicians to make laws to suit them. It's disgusting. Disney truly is one of the most evil corporations in the world. 😠  You KNOW that Disney is going to lead the charge to change laws about only human output being copyrightable so that they can replace their human staff with AI and still own and copyright the products. They'll also spearhead trying to make laws to limit AI creations so that they're one of the few who can actually use it. 😒
Great idea for film theory episode coming up in 3 2 1: you find out the true reason the world was destroyed in the show adventure Time. 😮
Can you do one about welcome home
“Yes you sitting at home without out your pants on” me sitting on the toilet 💀
i want a cocomelon correct timeline
Hey mat pat I have a huge question can you make a video about what stronger Bhaskar or vinranium
Day 1 of asking for you to do the lore of ENA (the videos on youtube) :))
Moral of the story; Intellectual Property is complete nonsense.
I need to see MatPat and Brandon Flowers from the killers in the same video
You should do a theory on sonic prime on how sonic’s shoes work, how he’s connected to the prism how the earth broke in five different worlds and what will happen next in the show
hi matpat, i like your ids, their cool.
Hi #TeamTheorists, I was just watching Hotel Transylvania 2 and I got curious upon seeing a scene that happened in the film. In the scene, Dracula tried to teach his grandson, Dennis, how to fly by throwing him off a tall building, this got my wondering just how tall was the building in the first place and would Dennis actually manage to not hit the ground in all the time Drac waited before going to save him? After all, gravity pulls acts very fast over a short period of time, so wouldn't Dennis end up getting killed from this? I know this is a kids film, but then again, this is what Theorists do so what do you guys think?
Thank you matpat I finally know what YouTube means by copyright, before I thought it meant that you steal others own stuff but now I realize it protects stuff you own specifically
Hey you should do Welcome Home the ARG it just started but it's really good :)
It’s just a theory A COPYRIGHT THEORY Thanks for watching
POV his next channel: law theory
Well pat my boy I have a video for you to doo........ I hear it too I wanna find the origin of that video and who is the entity @film theory
So idea Mickey and the Inc machine😂😂😂
Peter pan is a horor movie already
Bro I got scared when he said , "Yes you without your pants on" cuz I wasn't wearing my pants and I even looked around 💀
do da doo doo, do da doo d, do da doo doo,  it's his final countdown! >:)  🐭⚫
Winnie the Pooh looks like Shrek
Creepy the Pooh
How did he know I have no pants on
Im a bri'ish fella so uh...  Idk what copyright laws work here🫤
saperman
Can u make a theory from Vita Carins?
Hey MatPat don't know if you will see this comment but I have a theory. There is this show on PBS kids called Work It Out Wombats. At first it seems normal but then I realized something. The adult looking after the Wombats and is in there family is not the Wombats parents. Instead of Mom or Dad it is grandma. I think the parents are dead and the Wombats had to go to grandmas house. And the youngest wombat has a stuffy and if the stuffy is not in reach with the wombat he is sad. so I think the parents died and before they died they gave the youngest a stuffy to remember them.
Hey Matpat you should check out Welcome Home. Very fascinating new ARG, very well done so far
Disney on Mortal Kombat please! Haha
Mat you NEED to make a theory about detective conan, the plot is finally developing quickly I’d literally consume any type of content you’d put out of it😭😭😭
"You sitting at home without your pants on" Me, who literally took my pants off as soon as I got into my dorm bed lmao
Hey matpat what happens with dad and what the deal with @ManInRoom
I already seen clips of it it's terrible it's evil is horrible I really hate it so much I like my Pooh Bear as a happy honey bear not a bloody killer by the way MatPat I got bat news for you we go another horror movie mickey mouse one called Mickey's Mouse Teap since we already got a short called Runaway Brain
How did you know i didnt have my pants on?
Bro matpat you should look into the series of murder drones its getting good and the teaser for ep 4 just dropped five days and it can contain some good LOOOORE
Eezma, from Emorors New Groove, how old is she? how is she still alive? Why doesn't she make herself young? Why has Disneyland never made the ride to Eezma's secret layer!?
day one of asking for matpat to watch a series of unfortunate events on netflix
1:50  Am sorry for my language here but... HOW IN THE ACTUAL F•CK DID YOU KNOW
welcome home puppet 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💯💯💯🙏🙏🙏💯💯
6:55 I don't think either party is a big fan of the mouse rn, but gor completely different reasons.
Kingdom Hearts 4 be looking real good! 😂😂😂😂😂
Fun fact! Superman's "s shield" is actually called "The Sigil of El", coming from his kryptonian family. Jor-El, Zor-El, Lor-El, etc.
He said Pooh 😂
Ngl i hated the movie, to me it was really bad but that might just be my opinion
Don’t know who else has seen it but I feel like Liminal Land is something that I would love to see a video about
Okay, next theory: HOW THE F*** WINNIE THE POOH WAS SO F***ING TALL. I mean in the show he was just like small and on the movie he is bigger than Christopher!!!!!!
..... Hello
Disney's worst fear is people with original ideas! People who won't just rehash the story with shitty cgi.
You got me, at home with no pants, i only watch youtube when im pooping
not disney's worst nightmare but china government's worst nightmare
Remember when Bethesda attempted to sue Minecraft creator Notch for naming his new at the time game Scrolls?
i hate the fact that they did this to pooh bear
Matpat, you should make a video on the analogue horror Liminal Land, it seems quite interesting
I have a new Theory Liminal land its a yt acc and a Website it SO cool u need to find a code glitchi videos EVRITHING THAT U WANTTTT go first to the website
You should do a video on a YouTube Channel called milgram is a YouTube series I want to play as a warden in a prison and you have to determine if people are guilty and what crimes they’ve committed by watching music videos about the prisoners
5:41 dude why does it load on that part but if I skip a bit ahead, I can watch it did mat Patt say something that I could not hear?
This is just the begining more stuff will enter the public domain in the next few years.
13:21 Notably, you're still allowed to use trademarked words and symbols, just not on the covers or (as Matthew mentioned) in the marketing. DC did this for decades with Captain Marvel after Marvel got the trademark for that name. They put "Shazam" on the cover, but called him Captain Marvel inside the books.
9:40 I don't think the powers of a public domain Superman would be limited to the ones he had when originally published, since the powers themselves can't be copyrighted. However, you would be limited to his original costume, and things like Kryptonite and Lex Luthor would be out of bounds for a while as well
This is why Homelander exists 😅
Honestly the world works on legal loopholes 🐁🪤 Thanks Mick
Do a theory on emisis blue well I guess more of a explanation of what happened.
You should do a Bluey theory! There are some good ones out there
Matpat: We're just a bunch of nerds with a lot of free time,  Me: I've watched GTLive, you know that isn't true
Never been a huge Disney fan but the more I learn about what they do and have done makes me despise them behind belief
Matpat please do severence!!!
How did you know I was not wearing pants
OMG - just imagine - winnie the pooh with machete vs bamb with chainsaw in his teeths. It's coming...
The intro be like I'm a Material Girl       🤣😂🤣          ✌👁👄👁✌
Parody. It can maybe be argued a horror movie is a parody
ngl I would actually watch the Peter Pan horror movie cuz hearing and listening to all the theories about how Peter Pan is actually a bad guy while Captain Hook is the good guy tryna save the kids and whatnot sorta makes more sense to me than a bunch of kids going away on an adventure in an island that never lets them age so they stay as kids forever. I'd love to see a horror take on this --
Blanch
Watching this film gives me tramua now since, i have no idea if poohs watching me in real life in my garden
Did MatPat seen the "Fall"?. I think it would be cool to know how you can really survive that coming from him
Iran has near to no copyright rights so I can just use any charecter but it will be only in iran

Matpat can you do a horror arg named welcome home it's like a puppet show
Im sorry but how tf did he know i didint have pants on? 💀 its warm in my room so i didint have pants on so i suddenly panicked for a second 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This movie looks like a JR’s remake
To be fair, Reimagining characters without their iconogrophy sounds like a great way to get to the core of a character in creative ways.
The movie actually sucked
did you see kandyland animatronic series?
ok but stillll y would they do this to cute lil winnie da pooh TwT
Can you do a theory on on sing were it's how many kids Rosita would realistically have PS if you do this I would cry of happiness.
This exist... Why
"When you go camping this weekend, look out for:  The Lorax It kills for the trees"
Please do a film theory on cocaine bear
Horror movie based on disney .... so.... real life?
And how do-do you kn-know am not wearing pa-pants
Mickey is evil winni the Pooh noooo I loved Mickey Mouse Clubhouse when I was younger I was five and am 8  now I don’t watch it anymore
Hey mat pat if your looking for a new film theory I would highly recommend "welcome home" it's a old forgotten puppet shows for kids. They're also a dedicated team of fans who are trying to find the fragments. With the website having some spooky moments that have much more then you can see. Please make a theory!
How does matpat know wether or not I have my pants on
Ok but Neverland nightmare ight be good if petters the killer and kidnapper.
Hay matt patt  can you please make a the amazing world of gumball film theory you are my favorite YouTuber
You're come home I have secrets
Sunny is Disney's worst nightmare I thought China's worst nightmare was pooh not disney
I found theory for you you're welcome home
I like a Mario movie theory please
To their credit. Peter Pan is Already a Horror Story.
You should make a theory about the science of pan man
Peter Pan just needs a faithful adaptation
0:18 YOUR GETTING SLACKS
can you do welcome home
Mattpatt should do a theory on Unicorn Wars
"Is it worth it"? ohhhhhh yeeessssss! These are characters known world wide. Most people won't care that the products made are trademarked products. They care that it's Micky Mouse, Superman, or whatever. Just like movies doing well in foreign markets just because they have a recognizable actor attached too it. Then branding will tank with the characters as more... inappropriate let's say, material for the characters are made available outside of the weird parts of the internet.
"Da Hobbit" someone use that that way you don't have to worry about copyright
Another American thinks the universe rotates around them and their country!
I can't quite put my finger on it, but past the 11 minute mark, MatPat's voice sounds... different. Like, his mannerisms and emphasis are the same, but his tone of voice is just different. Not a bad thing, but like this if you hear it as well.
Nice intro
0:23 bruh it looks kind of suspicious 💀💀💀
Remember when _The Fine Bros._ tried to copyright the idea of reaction videos?
1:47 how did he know
I feel called out for the lack of pants
I'm sitting right here, feeling so happy because I see it. Canada, literally Canada, like where I live, and I've watched from theory for about a year. Now, not that long, but yeah, a year and I have never seen and him Canada.
This is what happens when you social credit score is too low And you live in china
How did you know???
Mickey is almost 100 years old   And still not married
Him: yes, you without your parents home sitting watching at home  Me: how did you know? How did you know?
Film theory idea:How does Cyborg digest food in TTG
Hey film theory I think you forgot to play mr hopps playhouse 3?
By next year, I fully expect someone to make a horror movie about Steamboat Willy
Superman turns to Soup-Man
Can you do a theory on Yu-Gi-Oh
Matpat? Is the channel “5-minute crafts” legal?
The Waffle House Has Spoken
Can you please do more _Boisvert on Film Theory? By now he has made nine new videos plus one short and I'm so confused with all of it.
Intellectual property is overrated
GIVE US MORE LAST OF US CONTENT!
Okay, now we need to talk about the real best movie of the year, Cocaine Bear.
Flim Theory: Behind The Dark Videos of JackStauber
My childhood why yyyyyyyy
Oh no....the rom-coms and fan-fics are coming!
A Peter Pan horror movie actually sounds kind of cool? Wasn't that his original premise or something anyway?
Is there any way to say in my will that I want everything I write to go into the public domain as soon as I die? I don't want to get screwed over by my kids like Disney and Tolkein have.
What funny is how he went over this on game theory
11:16 WHY DID HIS VOICE CHANGE ANF WHY DID UT STARTLE ME
fun fact: when i was little and i saw the “TM” meaning trademark i thought it meant “time” so when i saw a barbie logo saying “barbie TM” i thought it meant “barbie time!”
If i ever go to court, i want Matpat to be my lawyer
You’re making me wish I took that copyright class back when I was in library school 😅
is this me or that mickey is a giant rat
Film Theory  someone stole your vid and edit it and made you say bad words.
THEY'RE NOT DOLLTH MATPAT!!! THEY'RE ACTION FIGURTHS!!! 😂😂😂
You should do a film theory on the movie Terbo. I really wanna know if a snail could actually achieve super speed and if he could how badly he'd  Inevitable hurt himself moving that fast 😂
Can you do a theory on emensis blue
what about neo? as in that yu-gi-oh! card that came out n 2009 but didnt get a reprint in 2019?
0:01-0:30 wtf
0:09 Why does he sound like Patrick Warburton though?
Jese why do this
was this ment to be on netfix
How, how did you know that my pants were in fact not on my legs
make a film theory about unicorn wars. i need context.
Honestly on one hand its really annoying that things can't be put into public domain, but on the other it does make some sense that so long its being used they can be the only ones using it.   That said, that logo loophole is total bullshit, and it better not stop the piece of media itself from being public domain at least.
Okay okay so I recommend you do welcome home you wont regret it later
God I hope that D&D can start calling them hobbits, its so much better than halfling.
I have a question about this whole copyright thing, though. If Disney is so unconcerned about Mickey becoming public domain, why is it all in the news that they're rebranding Disney from the 100th anniversary on to have Figment the dragon be the new mascot instead of Mickey?
film theory idea: please talk about the lore of final faction.
I CLICKED ON THIS VIDEO WANTING LOOOOOOOORE!!!!!!!!!
Pog
I always wanted to create a movie "Winnie The Poop: The Great Diarrhea" and if I earn millions I make the sequel "Winnie The Poop : The Great Constipation"...
Wait why was pooh bare have Patrick Warburton's voice?
If they make Peter Pan the villain in that movie, I SWEAR I'M GOING TO BREAK SOMETHING. I hate when people think Peter Pan was the villain of the story, he was just an inmature kid.
Film teroy idea did you do a theory on Michael Myers yet if you haven't then my theory is that the mask makes him invisible.
Are you going to have an attack on titan theory before it ends?
How did matpat know I didn’t have pants on
Superman is already been done with Brightburn
With Companies learning & using the powers of Trademarks Can't the Copyright's Law be restored in its Original form?
It was awful, (Spoilers)  The only thing they spent money on was the masks and hands.  The writing was horrendous, I’ve seen people try and say “if you like 80’s slashers you will like this”…. Maybe if you are brain dead… the slashing is fine but the story is completely all over the place.  Right at the start it says “they promised never to talk again”. Later some random women had been speaking to them.  At the start it says they went crazy because Christopher Robbin left, later he comes back.  “Why are you doing this, why?!!” Next line, “I’m sorry I left you all alone I didn’t mean to” Next “Why are you doing this”  Again his wife dies early on, and he’s a little upset, at the end some random girl he doesn’t know dies and he has a nervous breakdown.  They are eeyore, but where was rabbit and owl?   At one point Pooh summoned a bunch of bees, this was a really fun idea… although it was night and bees don’t fly and night and even if I let that go, they never came back to and, it was never mentioned by anyone after a 2 second clip.
The worst thing about this video is knowing some of Disney content isn't actually Disney property. Winnie the Pooh Disney obtained the rights to make the movies based on the books. The Author originally wasn't going to give them the rights either. As for PeterPan the rights are a bit more special. The original author of PeterPan on his death gave the rights to Great Ormond Street Hospital. A charity children's hospital. A Prime Minister extended those rights indefinitely in UK. So as far as I know they still have rights to it here in UK. Ironically Disney tried to get PeterPan to be in the public domain so they didn't have to pay a children's hospital. If you want a Disney is evil theory that is an easy one to look into.
My Superman = souper man
For your next video, can you do welcome home is about a creepy puppet a r g that you have to solve via a website.think it would be really entertaining if you did it, please please pretty please
Could you try and do Emesis Blue? I’d love to see your view on it, and it’s free on YouTube
Not sure if this was a theory vid so much as a legal lesson vid but I enjoyed it none the less. Great work as always! 👍
I'm actually scared right now and feel like throwing up 🥺 💦
i literally didnt have pants on when you pointed at me.... scary
5:38 All that Disney owns is what elements *they* added, until last year it was the estate of Alan Alexander Milne(the writer who created the character in the 1920s)that owned the character
How did you know my pants were off
MATTIPATTY THERE ARE NEW BACKROOMS VIDEOS CHEK IT OUT!
I don't really mind these things not entering the public domain. If Disney as a company went away, then sure, I think we should be able to use the characters to make new stories. But while the creator of them is around (the company), I'm fine with them having the right to use their own stuff without others being able to also. If I really want a mouse character for something, I can just make my own. I feel like the only reason to use Mickey as opposed to something else is to try to capitalize on the nostalgia or branding that someone else made first. That just seems like the wrong way to popularize your own work.
11:16 - 11:20, why mat pat sound like kermit? 🤣
1:49 how do you know
Dude I finally get to voice mickey and make him the blackest mouse 😂😂
Ik im talking abt old movie lorax but if they didnt have tree's how did they get paper?
Can you say Steamboat Willie: Death Cruise ?     Btw, one topic you may want to cover in the future to compliment this video is the legalities of a parody. After all, the lionshare of profits in adult movies these days comes from parodies. (See what I did there?)
I don't know ho, but I've been able to predict the into lines for the past 5 videos"hello internet welcome to film thoury, the show that.." And what ever comes next.
I cant wait for people to ruin the Mouse. You reap what you sow, Disney.
Im watching this at night ima gonna regret this
Given the direction Disney is headed in, it would be shocking if they didnt try to return to their roots in some way. Their company is hemorrhaging workers
Can we get the lore behind Johnny sins we need a Johnny sins film theory
So Wednesday Infidelity is getting Steamboat Mickey?
There's a Chinese Superman web novel series with the translated title of "The Kryptonian of a Certain American Comic"...
Can you please do a theory on welcomehomepuppetshow
I have an idea for a channel crossover;  Who would win? Dinsey, Mc'Donalds, or Nintendo?  Basically, if they all wanted to take over all the industries, who would come out on top?
Image this video gets copyright
you should do a theory on the owl house :)
Ngl... I was expecting a video talking about the movie, not copyright law.
OK ima need a theory on how you knew my pants where down sir
I was all 27 views of mathew paric's video, "steyle thoery :leg washing", and can say with confidence that I will not be washing my legs ever again.
oh yes
I'm kinda sad that matpat, in all his infinite knowledge, hasn't theorized about the Barbie cinematic universe yet
I was using the toilet when he "sitting with out ur pants on"
Awesome video guys! Copyright it such a complicated thing and its nice to have an amazing team putting these issues at the front! I just wanted to say that Adam Ruins Everything actual had an episode about the last time Mickey Mouse and the Grimm Fairy tails were almost put into the public domain. I believe it was in 2019.
but... Paddington Bear... isn't based off of Winnie the Pooh?
I feel like you would really enjoy watching the sun and moon show it’s an amazing YouTube channel
I will NOT be going to Disneyland...........
Hey matpat, make an theory about berserk's world and the god hand in berserk's world
I thought Disney was in the process of replacing Mickey with Figment.
Don't worry, Disney will find a way to lobby Gov't to keep their copyrights.
MatPat I need you to solve alice in borderland or make a theory about it cause it is really hard for me to understand the show
Acting As if they haven’t been doing this game with trademark since the very beginning heck Disney is in hazard so that the public IP they stole their stories from don’t even come up on top searches this is an anything new this is stuff we already knew going into it
It sorta seems like goosebumps franchise
MATPAT STOP GIVING THEM IDEAS FOR THE NEW MOVIE IN 2024
Once the Mickey Mouse Club and Muppets become public domain, I'm gonna start a war between them
The only reason I think they WILL get backed is if they use the argument they want to protect children. Because, unfortunately, Disney has gotten so big and recognizable... A lot of their stuff going into public domain COULD cause issues for children. And a lot of laws exist strictly to protect children.
grinch also has a horror movie called the mean one.
wait what if you draw something thats a trademark like micky mouse can they sue me if i do it then?
Idk why I’m telling anyone this but before watching this video I was listening to “deal with destiny”
I have a theory request! So there is a band called Stray Kids and they’ve kinda been trending lately. Usually, K-pop bands offer a hidden storyline along with music in their MVs and I’d love for you to make a theory about their storyline. Hope you take this into consideration!
Is it normal for me to get nightmares from the mouse without even the horror movie about it?
They got Bambi and Peter pan😭
You just use the poppy playtime experiment 1006 the hand
matpat i learn more from you then i ever have from school fr
Is it just me or does matpat's voice sound a bit off during some parts of this video? Maybe he was dealing with a cold or something during the recording of this episode but some lines sound a bit kermit-y if you start listening for it :o  10:45 like the latter half of this sentence for instance,, it's almost like they spliced 2 takes together 11:15
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0ODG8bFme0 great film recommend for a theory if possible Please
I have realized that I don't have my pants
How does mat pat know I’m not wearing pants😮
I FINALLY made an account just so I could comment on Mat Pat's videos..... I'd say that we both rock 😁
I think meatcanyon already figured it out 😂😂.
have you guys seen lifeofcobypeirson this guy is. crazy man clones humans irl
Hmm... bing chilling
Wait wait, so does this mean that my diary which I wrote, will one day become public domain?
11:20 matpats voice decided to change 😂
Did you see the new merge mansion adds
If they make a horror film starring mickey it would be a banger.
Deregulated banks can fail and deregulated trains can crash and deregulated planes can fall out of the sky and we can suffer daily spree shootings for the benefit of gun manufacturers and we can pay more for worse health outcomes but companies would blush to bribe politicians to extend copyright.  Sure.
I hate trademark law
how old i jj and his friends
when did the mom and dad get married
is jj adopted
when was jj born
i need answers please
coco
cocomelon timeline matpat
Ha jokes on you Matpat I have pants on!
Now we need a horror Mickey Mouse that would kinda be like    Mickey And the Slaughter club house
why the heck  did Mat start sounding slightly deeper halfway in the video.. the more u hear stuff the weirder it sounds huh? (ive been binging the dude, lol)
1:48 BUT it's that one Tiktok that's Wii Family Feud and the guy going "how'd he know I'm a Gemini? I DIDN'T PUT MY BIRTHDAY IN!"
Hey, MatPat! I had a burning question for you. Why have you stopped including the intro montage in your recent videos? I immensely enjoyed the intros of all the three channels, as they set me in the mood for a theory. It would be quite nice, if the intros could be brought back?
S U P E R M A N spaces everywhere
And that's why I love Germany: Trademark protection can expire if the brand becomes synonymous with a whole genre of products, also known as Deonyms. For example, there used to be a brand of paper tissues called Tempo (it still exists), but because everybody started using their brand name for every kind of paper tissue they had a hard time prolonging the trademark
Who is gonna tell matpat about Wattpad fanfiction? No character is safe there...
My childhood has been ruined and the video just started.
It's very uncreative for me. If they just make a horror version of characters that already exist. They're basically using the popularity of the characters to gain attention; clout because they're just indie filmmakers. Still, I'd rather watch an indie horror movie with original characters.
What If a UNNC. from halo vent to war on Republic in star wars who vod vin
Soup a man
Before i start to watch i theorised that the NEW mickey cartoon done in the OLD animation style was a why to recopyright, The new specials look eerliy close to steamboat willy!
Hello kid not murder drones and n are how to get the same uzi and n how okay doll lizzy v
1:45 the fact that its true is sending me
Hey matpat can you do a video explaining how much money mr beast has?
It should go back to 8 years with a extension like it was originally. Screw Disney and its monopolizing of all these franchises.
Honestly am I the only one thinking if the public gets their hands on these characters it may possibly ruin their image for younger audiences, and childhood memories especially fanfics or more awful movies like Winnie-the-Pooh.💀
Stop giving us the disclaimer that "this only applys for the US". A Lot of your food theories AND EVERYTHING that includes the word "OSHA" does this. So don't pretend like you care.
Mats gonna get sued for using mickey in the vid
What about the first ever Disney short, Plane Crazy?
Sitting at home without your pants on, you literally just called me out, and now I feel like...I'm not alone all of a sudden....
I love Disney and Mickey mouse 😂😁
Goofy horror movie would be the greatest idea ever! Whoever tackles it better do it right
how did matpat know that Im not wearing pant
Trademark and Copyright uh huh  Next movie ?
welp so much for poobear vtubers. they'll be stuck as a naked yellow bear until the red shirt enters public domain. LOL
thought this was gonna be abt the ccp
Can you guys do a theory on The Maze Runner and why Teresa betryed Thomas
Oh wow that reminds me how an old girlfriend of mine did a little classroom presentation once about how she liked that change to the Disney logo. Or at least... Hmm the details are all jumbled up now... Might have the wrong context or even wrong ex. But man. If I am thinking about the 2018 girl.... I miss that school, those days, that person.
Hey! He got Patrick Warburton to do an intro (unless I'm hearing things). Which reminds me of when he did Tom Nook for foafy.
Yess finally someone sticking it up to that fuckin mouse! 😂
The movie is so bad
I have a theory in the lorax. Is O'Hare giving people bad candy in the commercial at the end it says "breathe responsible" and why does no one try to leave. Think about it
You should make a life Theory channel that talks about stuff like how the pyramid were made, even though it was obvious aliens
One last video before bed…
I'm actually wearing pants today.
i am officially afraid of whoever makes MatPat’s thumbnail
They should keep the copyright duration term for individuals the same and lower it for corporations
4:48 hehe, reminds me of the mess called "react world".
Tho they didn't take the box office by storm(not surprised). The budget was 100 grand, and they earned 2.5  million.
China changing stuff to avoid copyright has got to be funniest thing ever, look up "special man" 😂😂
Would you mind me just clipping the whole video but don't worry you'll earn the most credit
better watch this video before it gets taken down for having like 5 seconds of mickey 😭
That looks like the luxury of life bear
South parks gonna be happy
Nah bruh you know to much “ yes you sitting at home without your pants on “ 1:46
Bro how did matpat know I didn’t have pants on. Can he see me?
Unless Disney renews their license, Mickey is next because he’s just so flipping OLD.
And it’s nothing I want any part of.
almost 4m with a 100k budget... this is a huse success
They’re maximizing profits cuz people like you are promoting them?  Question mark mark
What if someone trademarked.. the trademark?
I honestly really don't wanna see Mickey get ruined, he's iconic and a big part of my childhood
Disney’s worst fear is sony
The most demonetized video ever
my turn to get pinned
pin pls
Wasn't this movie like hyped up
You should do a video on the project scooby doo video that’s trending with the new Velma show
Is there gonna be a John Wick theory in the future going in dept on the rules and background of the secret society, like what are the families and everything 👀 just interested
I think some good works could come out of this. Imagine a Winnie the Pooh or Mickey Mouse movie where instead of a edgy horror bloodbath there are more adult and deep themes that Disney isn't brave enough to depict. Something like Del Toro's Pinocchio but with disney characters. The fact that they necessarily have to distance themselves from the modern depictions of these characters to avoid copyright could ironically become an advantage instead of a limitation.
You should do a film theory on the tv show Bread barbershop
sOnIc, Speed and trama 😂
they make another FCKING WINNIE THE POOH HORROR MOVIE I WILL FCKING FIND THEN IMMA GIVE THEM A TASTE AN AMERICAN A10 FINE DINNING EXPERIENCE
i feel like the cinamatic universe is gonna be named "RYCCU" or "Ruining your Childhood Cinimatic Universe" Who's With Me? \/
Mickey Mouse Slaughter House is gonna be a banger 😂
I love how MatPat couldn’t say member-berries at the end 😂
.......um.....have you not heard of treasure island?
Who else is eating honey while watching this vidio
Not no No No pooh bear Nooooo Now this is where I draw the line Evil is Out
Just going to point this out, but Paddington Bears were around since 1958. Inspired by the sight of Jewish refugee children arriving in London and Britain's countryside. Often these children would appear with a sign saying "Please look after this child."
so question… what was fan fiction this whole time-?
Ok but who tf thought a Winnie the Pooh horror movie was a good idea? I would like to talk to the guy high enough to think of this and actual do it. The only spinoff horror type of movie I liked from a known character was bright burn, that thing deserves a bit more recognition. Wasn't so bad of a watch.
1:47 How did you know?!?!
Can you make a theory about Terrifier? O.o'
6:58 extremely shocked to see Team Fortress 2 Pyro's flamethrower in a video of yours lol
Copyright laws are scummy, and I’ve learned from the video that they were made worse (what I’m referring to when I say scummy) because of companies like Disney. I find it screwed up for many reasons and one example is if someone is born today and a piece of work/entertainment/or whatever is made on the same day (and gets copyrighted) that someone will never be able to work with said work. Copyright laws need to be changed and revised. If I want to be able to make my own stories from something that came out 30 years before I was born like Star Wars or something) I should be able to, as long as it’s my own ideas that I’m adding into the mix. This means my own artistic style/or if I add anything to the story/basically just if I’m creative with it and not just doing the same cookie cutter formula, if this is the case I should be able to use it. I can talk for hours about copyright laws and most of it’s going be why it’s bad and it that things need to change.  Edit: Also copyright laws involving music are just plain fucking stupid. Looking at them I just think “ these have got to be some of the dumbest things I’ve ever seen be written down on paper, and ENFORCED”
@ 10:38, MatPat plugs all his channels by using yellow, green, red, and blue. God speed to ya, Matthew.
I had absolutely no idea this movie existed and I am excited to  Watch it honestly this whole project that they have sounds phenomenally
I thought Disney's worst fear was Ronan Farrow 😂
OK, imagine this Mario movie two but instead of them, are you being mean character Luigis mansion mic drop
Could you do a toy story if you can find something
Mickey Mouse: Slaughterhouse Aladin: The Last Wish Killing Nemo Killing Dory The Killer Mermaid  I know I missed some, but I can't think of any more cheesy names.
9:13 DONT GIVE THEM ANY IDEAS!!! [the first one was bad enough]
you should do a theory on the movie 9
Matpats waht happen Doors movie I hope be 2025?
Do a Episode on bolt
What episode
At like around 11:17 mats inner Kermit just pops out when he says "like I explained above" lol  new theory mattpatt is Kermit the frog
My wife, who is a lawyer said ‘good job Matt Pat’.
I stole his honey and he’s coming for me 😂
how did he know that i had no pants?
Disney is crazy
I would probably call a superman story "Clark Kent: The Super Man"
Is that foot of a ferret
Oh poohp, he’s done it again
Is there something wrong with the video? I cannot watch it beyond time stamp 5:38
Get ready for ssuperman
Wow Winnie was Tom nook the whole time
I'll be curious to see how long the trademark stuff lasts as an argument because the Supreme Court has ruled in the past that Trademarks can's be used to extend Copyrights.  Which came from the various lawsuits arguing that Zorro can't be used by anyone despite being public domain because the estate or company was claiming that they owned all the trademarks on his name and likeness, but the courts ruled against them by saying the name Zorro is too vague and doesn't allow for someone to tell the difference between a brand vs a character.  Which might be why you hardly ever see a Zorro project just be called Zorro.
make a theory about babybus
How the 1:48 how in the world did he know I wasn’t wearing pants?
i just want another try at it with a big budget behind it . better said than done but with a strong community i’m sure it’s possible. this genre has been a thing i’m the internet for years. like myspace days and mickey mouse as a gangster😂 i’m sure talented independent film makers can pass 100,000 with community help. i will donate bruh i want the goods
I feel like Disney is gonna do whatever Disney wants to do lol.
you should make a crime theory like a real life crime explained you know
Can you do the Grinch one (or did you already)
Interestingly enough, last year I started volunteering online by narrating public domain works to be turned into audio books for fair use and was considering narrating the original Winnie the pooh.
I loved when you said Oh Bother. It was 100 percent close to the language of the BRITISH
Matpat did you know that your marioplex number has officially become a new number 🎉😮
As someone who was nicknamed Winnie the Pooh as a small child (due to my name being somewhat similar), I cannot tell you how weird this is. Even weirder than it is for everyone else.
Christopher Robbin said he was done with poop .  come on Disney is not doing horror stuff come on now why would they do that ?
This topic reminds me of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. If you know what I'm talking about, you know. 😂😂😂
Do you guys think you could do a theory on the Welcome Home ARG? I'm super interested on what it could hide but lack the knowhow to properly go investigating myself, as do many others, I'm sure.
I did not expect to get called out within the first 2 minutes of this video😅😅
Hi
I myself am a 5 nights at Freddy's and horror fan so I welcome this
I wonder if this is why Amazon's ring of power couldn't use the word Hobbits, but used the words harfoots instead. 🤔
Everyone remind him to do a theory on salad fingers epsisode 12
mickey mouse is the reason there is suffering in the world thanks for the vid mat pat loved the video!!!
Matpatt you need to address the restrict act bill s-686
1:47 you should do a pole on how many people benge YouTube on the throne lol
Brb writing a story of a bloodthirsty Mickey Mouse committing murders on a steam boat. The title? Steamboat Killie.
1:50 I have pants on
Plsss do an owl house vid plssssss
How did you know I didn’t have my pants on😂
So interesting
16:37 That animation is most likely NOT the original animation from Steamboat Willie, because it should be followed by Mickey pulling the strings for the boat whistles right after he has finished whistling. That was not included in the new logo, so it must've been new animation, but in the style of the original.🤔
9:18 Wrong, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Are NOT under public domain it's still under the Tolkien Family. How do I know this will I happen to know the Tolkien family very well.
So I could make a show like “Small Ville”? Super man name not in title, won’t have a suit so no S logo. Lemme write my script
16:26 That was also at the same time period when Disney stopped making traditionally animated "2D" theatrical films, and started to embrace more reliable and experimental computer animation, akin to their long-time colleague, Pixar. In fact, the last two "cel-animated" feature films that came after that were The Princess and the Frog in 2009, and Winnie the Pooh in 2011. After that, the mainstream 2D animation by Disney has been strictly limited to television shows, like Phineas & Ferb, Gravity Falls, The Owl House etc. And even these excellent shows are not animated with any of the traditional tools or methods, because they are deemed "too expensive and time consuming", and are instead made with more modern digital tools. One exception to this standard is the game Cuphead (and its DLC), where practically ALL the character animations were first drawn on paper with a pen, and then scanned into computer for coloring. The Cuphead Show on Netflix, however, was animated entirely digitally, but it was made to resemble old-timey elastic animation, so the difference is little harder to tell.😉
MatPat and the Mouse have been rivals for centuries!
Does the South Park opening text block allow them to get around the copyright laws? Just wondering, because there are episodes with what appears to be Disney characters in them.
Do a theory on the new salad fingers
I KNEW I WASNT THE ONLY ONE THAT THOUGHT THE D IN DISNEY LOOKED LIKE A G!
11:15 why does matpat sound more like a muppet here
And this intro is why MatPat will get sued
I'm surprised you haven't done a My Little Pony Friendship is Magic theroy. There has to be SOMETHING dark about this kids' show. Such as Twilight Sparkle possibly destroyed the tree of elements!
Not this helping me with Entrepurneuership class lmao
UH OH! I DIDNT KNOW THIS WAS A CROSS OVER!!!
11:28 For some reason, I always thought that the "D" in Disney looked like "G".😅
Like I explained above haha
I’m so excited to see this for some reason haha
The movie cost less than $100,000 to make, and has made over $5 Million...
It’s not just the powers that made Superman super. The world could really use the heart and wisdom of golden age Superman right about now.
Disney intro with Micky will always be favorite... idgaf
5:54 Nintendo Switch Online Membership before Nintendo Switch Online.🤣
You guys know what this means. We can use Mickey in fnf a lot easier. Since people already use that old style.
Fascinating!
2:37 After Mickey has entered the public domain, his place for the new Disney mascot will likely go to either Jiminy Cricket or Tinker Bell, since they have been represented very clearly in past Disney marketing and logos. The modern Disney logo even features references to both of them: two bright stars next to each other, akin to the line "second star to the right and straight on till morning" from Peter Pan, and the melody from Pinocchio's "When You Wish Upon A Star". There's also Casey Jr., the circus train from Dumbo, but that's beside the point.🦗🧚‍♀️🌟
I'll believe it when I see it. Disney has a bad habit of bribing, threatening,  and having people that won't sell major hits to them mysteriously disappearing. When it is time for mickey to become public they will just so happen to have a bill quietly passed that will extend their copy right.
1:42 Ironically, that same fate will eventually happen to the mascot of Disney himself, Mickey Mouse! You see, the license for the Original Mickey Mouse design is going to expire in 2024, after which that Mickey will go into public domain, but the more modern iteration of Mickey will probably still stay with Disney.🤔
Copyright theory Channel would be dope
For some reason, the video stopped working at 5:41. I refreshed the page, even opened a new tab and searched for the video, it would just stop at 5:41. But when I skipped to 5:46 it would play again. But for 5:41-5:45 it would not. Weird.
Somewhere, Loggins and Messina are saying, "So wait... did we dodge a bullet 50-odd years ago?"
DO A THEORY ON AMPHIBIA
Honestly, I wish them luck. Things not specifically made to be public domain shouldn't become public domain unless they have fallen into disuse.
Zuperman and the horror on krypton, soon in a theater near you
He need a new channel
I really want to make a three movie about the original Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman cause they will be in the Public Domain in 11-13 years and then make a crossover movie with them… but it looks like it will be harder then I thought
1:48 bro, where u at?
Is there lore in ENA?      • https://youtu.be/xUwJWv38FpY
Fucking disgusting. That's why we all need to vote for pirate parties in our countries (if you not familiar, these are not about pirating stuff, but about reforming copywriting laws)
Gee I wonder what would cause half the government to not be happy with Disney. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Oh like pushing politics, alphabet mafia, and the rest of madness towards children. 🤔 Yep no reason to dislike the Disney franchise for destroying everything it touches. 😂
You should make a legal theory channel
Let's not forget the banana splits horror movie
I always thought it was funny dragon ball z almost outright copies the logo for copyrighting
Wow the Disney vs Public Domain debate is a good choice to cover for a video NGL.
I thought it was a joke
but wait where is the explanation of the movie.????
wait, how did matt pat know im not wearing pants...
Sure there's a lot of restrictions but I can't wait for people to go crazy on this stuff. They always surprise me how far they're willing to go and I love it.
10:13 ahh yes the edgy leather hoodie Mickey or should i say King Mickey 🤣
So it's only a matter of time before Disney's animation studio becomes a transition animation from one mickey form to the next to cover him forever
There’s one thing that’s in common with Disney and anime, both of them have rodent satans.
11:15 he sounds like Barney
Are_y0u_happY is something you should react to it's a creepy VHS tape
This was way more interesting that I thought it'll be 😶
Mat: It belongs to you. Yes, you sitting at home without your pants on. Me: (Looks down to see that I'm wearing pants) Aw, dang it. Guess he's not talking about me.
I'll never understand Disney's fear of Mickey mouse entering the public domain. At some point he has to become public domain
You really did NOT have to call me out for not wearing pants... No cool bro, not cool...
Soup or Man
NNNNOOOO MATEW PARIC WAS MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER
Just wait for my movie called The Stainless ManSuper
Yes you sitting at home without your pants off. Me: looks at my pants.
I kept waiting for the twist to be that Disney themselves produced this horror movie.
When you start the video in the bathroom and get masterfully called out.
Wow, mega awesome!!👏👏
Hi
I'm not gunna lie, this makes me want to write a book called "A Boat Captain named Micky" and fill it with shorty stories about the misadventures of a mouse sailing up and down the Missisippi river.
Can not be worse than the live action dogshit that Disney puts out...as far as Mackey mouse, he will never be put in public domain, they own enough politicians ,like Andy does toys, so they won't let that happen...but will totally steal IPs from everyone else once they enter public domain
I wonder if Legal Eagal will be doing a video on the matter. Seems like something the public auto to know, especially since corporations are apparently favored far harder than individual people for how long the protections last.
MATPAT. Have you heard of welcome home? Will we be getting theory’s about It?
Now I wonder about the Marvel logo that have a hundred different panels of comics. would that mean none of those panels could be used?
Mat!!! I beg you to do a film theory on "The Portrait of God" it is a masterpiece and I think it deserves a theory!
That's not Pooh!
do pls theory for emesis blue horror film!!!
Mickey Mouse + Horror = Bendy and the Ink Machine 🐀
at this point matpat could create the biggest arg ever
What am i supposed to interpret from this matpat
Why do they ruin such things they had to ruin Winnie the Pooh
Always interesting. I don't think things would change that much. But I'd really like to see some NEW creativity in movies. Does it need to be Mickey Mouse or Pooh Bear?  if  it does isn't relying too much on people's knowledge of them.  Like Scary Movie it's just a parody / spoof. That actually just makes me less interested in seeing it.  They can't make their own characters they have to take these popular ones.
Controversial opinion: This pooh horror movie S U C K S. And i hate that these iconic cartoon characters are Being turned into those stupid "horror" movies.
PLEASE DO A THEORY ON WELCOME HOME
wait- i am quite confused- when matpat mentioned the term fanfics about superman, hobbit etc.  dont they already exist?  infact there are currently 92,202 works available on the tolkien works in ao3 at this moment, and somehow no fanfic ever gets copyright stiked, can someone explain this to me?
I'm not the only one that heard mat turn into kermits for a sec when he was talking about trademark right
I was hoping for. Cameo from legal eagle
Im surprised there has never been a theory about the twilight book/movie series. Theory idea "how did the vampire family get so wealthy" because in the movies they have fancy cars and a massive mansion and they are vampires? How did they make all that money  Please like this comment so my idea can be seen if you are also interested in this theory
Just an educated guess, a LEGAL EDUCATED GUESS!
Disney only owns the Pooh with the red sweater. Everything else is public domain.
Matt lowkey threw some shade at the fine bros 😂 respect
Was that Joe Swanson
While I definitely agree with you, this is still generally untested in the courts. From what I have seen there are copyright experts who are skeptical to say the least about the ideas of using trademark to restrict the access to public domain works. Even if Disney’s interpretation ends up being future precedent , there are still thousands of works entering the public domain every year.
2:21 ngl my favorite part of the video was all these characters just dancing away 😂😂
Came here to see if anyone caught that "Nostalgia Berries" joke at the end. Apparently no one 'member Chewbacca again...
Props to Mat and the team for bringing such engrossing theories
The ONLY time I watch something with no pants on, matpat calls me out. Sigh  1:47
I am so happy!  My life has totally changed🥰🥰.. I earned €74,000 with an initial investment of €3,500 per month.  Most top earners have a life that is more than just a paycheck… leaving all your family and friends behind to grow your money through profitable investments is knowledge.
This explains so much how Brightburn became a “Superman” villain origin story and they still were able to make it without problems. It wasn’t the best movie but at least I know how they were able to make it. Thank you Film Theory! Learning a new thing every week!
So can we get the steam boat Willy murder movie next year
This explains so much how Brightburn became a “Superman” villain origin story and they still were able to make it without problems. It wasn’t the best movie but at least I know how they were able to make it. Thank you Film Theory! Learning a new thing every week!
The irony is some of disneys most popular works have benefited from the public domain so their attempts to suppress it is more annoying
1:28 bro just made me remember sharknado 😭
"I'm going to choose to believe they offered everyone who voted in favor of it a free trip to Disney World". Look at MatPat encouraging illegal quid pro quos.
Anyone else remember ginger deadman we are getting or 70 and 80 horror movies back xD only better cameras
The concept of the film reminds me of the artist that made mock up posters of kids games (Hungry Hungry Hippos, Guess Who, Mouse Trap, etc.) as horror movie posters.
Let's make it the most liked comment🥚
Daniel tiger is cursed
Jokes on you Matpat, I'm wearing pants this time.
Q
'Maturity' is Disney's worst fear.
I'm actually not wearing pants.😐
13:19 Yes, yes it is.
does this mean i can make my own story of Jesus from the bible?
13:53 oh lord, please give me the joy of having a girl with pooh hosiery
0:33 I though my wifi was acting up bc the screen froze💀
Avatar the way of the Pooh...lol
Yes you without your pants on: me not wearing pants 😨
Anybody that was scared of him as a kid this is there adult nightmare 😂
Day 1 of asking for a Fortnite theory
YO WTF 1:48 HOW TF DID HE KNOW, THAT GENUINELY TERRIFIED ME 🤣
Aye but it doesn't mean you can't make artistic renditions of an original character in the Public domain
I mean the first thing that we'd see is a horror mickey movie
How did he know i had no pants on?
ℂ𝕒𝕟𝕒𝕕𝕒
I really really hope the thumbnail isnt ai generated
We need a Winnie The Pooh where he integrates into modern society and decided to become a YouTuber that only takes Honey sponsorships.
As soon as a bunch of the more modern depictions of characters are out, I can’t wait for the creepypasta horror movies to be made. It may be somewhat cheesy, but Abandoned by Disney would be an entertaining horror movie.
Its wrong to copyright stuff
You should do a theory about the alien in the movie nope
(warning of topic) i need help i cant sign into my x box account
Bro please just give us a film theory on the amazing world of gumball if you do I will subscribe
Technicly the mouse that will expired in 2024 were the steamboat willy one.  If the modern mouse that we know now. We probably need to wait more decade or even century to get a bad mickey mouse spooky movie.
Bruh you did not just make a 20 minute video explaining an extremely simple concept that you could have done in 2 with information most people already know
Hahahahahahahaha so funny 0:20
Didnt realize the characters of Winnie the Pooh were under public Domain, theirs so many old horror movies that are under it like Night Of The Living Dead, Nosferatu, and almost any Silent horror movie
Souperman
It’s the new 52 Pooh bear don’t know how many get that
Anyone noticed how he mentioned style theory?
9:25 AYO MATPAT WHAT IS THIS THIS DISGUSTING ABOMINATION
Adam Conover made a video talking about how Disney & other companies went to have Mickey Mouse kept out of public domain for 120 years....yet they make so many movies based on public domain characters. The hypocrisy was insane
i watched this movie in cinema and i swear it was the worst movie i watched, i couldnt even sit down and watch it for over than 25 min💀💀💀💀i want my money back ngl
Matt: Yes, you sitting at home without your pants on.  Me: Impossible. How did he know my plans for tonight?
He Scoops, He Doops, He Woops,  He Duperman 🤷🏻‍♂
If Disney ever needs a new Mickey voice they can look no further
Talking about copyright when prettymuch rewording Captain Midnight's video 😅
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
i think video game developers need to keep an eye out on these domains opening up.    being able to make collabs without the years of communicating towards how the collaboration works out could be really good for some games.
This is why the public domain needs to exist, and Walt Disney knew that.
Bro watching that movie literally made me cry 😭😭😭
what a coincidence this was our topic in our Media Information and Literacy subject about copyrights and shits the things i have learned in our class is usefull rn
Oh yeah! Winnie the Pooh is in the public domain now!!!
someone had better make a really dark action movie where Winnie The Pooh has a gun and is played by Nicolas Cage
Ye accha tha
Hello there
PLEASE DO A THEORY ON “Welcome home”  IT’S A NEW AND UPCOMING HORROR PUPPET THING  I HOPE U CHECK OUT ON IT
At this point anything that hurts Disney is a good thing.
THE SUPERMAN
Realising we could get a whole “Superman” movie based on the oil rig scene and the scene where Seasons by Chris Cornell played in Man of Steel. Just pre-superman, pre-reporter, wayward drifter Clark Kent using his might to help people where he needs to.
1:49 excuuuuuse me
John Wick-4 is a pure cinematical masterpiece a piece of art and a kiss of chef ❤️😘.I'll rate it 1000/10.
Why does a character goes into public domain tho?
pRon time lol
am i going crazy or did matpats voice change at 11:15 ngl it sounds a bit like goofy for a second
anyone else having issues with the video stopping at 5:42?
Terrific video Such a wide aperture of vision Learned a lot Thanks
Can you make a video about freeman
Man, When will pooh finally stop throwing missiles?????
murder drones pls
Jesus, this movie actually looks horrifying and it shouldn't be.
Wait... STYLE theory? Thats not an Early April fools?
Trademark law, that's it
disney's worst fear is 'copyright theory'
Wow I thought that steamboat willie thing was just a cute anniversary thing but of course there’s more to it
Me:hey it’s Winne the Pooh My lil sis:Hm the poster looks spooky why is he holding an axe? Me:uh he’s about to chop some wood My lil sis:alright ima watch it and this time ima watch it on my own Hmph  Me:heh alright  A few hours later My lil sis :WHY DID YOU SHOW ME THAT Me:he he cuz I trolled you :]
I thought it would be a fun film, turned out to be a bummer. This one sucked more than fall
How'd you know I was getting comfy without pants? 😢
Regarding Corporations, Consider that there are Uni-party functions that happen as both sides of the lobbing world would benefit from an extension to there claims.
For the longest while, I thought the "D" in the Disney logo was a backward G and I was confused for so long until I realized it's actually a D. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought it looked like a G lol.
I don’t know why, but I absolutely love it when the theorist channels start talking about copyright, trademarks, and the public domain and seeing the lengths companies are willing to go to keep their IPs in their control.
I don't understand why Disney is the bad guy for protecting a character they created.
1:48 i just got out of the shower pretty sure matpat's spying on me😬
I had an idea for a dark Peter Pan, since it’s author was most likely a criminal pedophile. It changes the meaning of those stories in that light, but I just didn’t want to dig in on that very dark thought.
Oh no legal loopholes 😨😰
How about micky the butcher mouse or super dude 😂
Disney watching this be like write this down before we lost our property
I can’t wait for a horror Mickey Mouse movie (if there is going to be one)
I'm a huge Winnie the pooh fan, and this is the worst movie I have ever seen. :(
Not matpat sniping me on the can. I was just about to get up too 😂😂
What is that noise in the background IT IS DRIVING ME INSANE
https://youtu.be/1M1r_C3EXNc  https://youtu.be/MzAdSGJAcPc
Disney's remakes target the nostalgia & the long term investment with kids who will grow up and show their children Disney movies ect but also what if it has something to do with the public domain? Personally don't really understand why they chose to remake Pete's Dragon of all movies. Maybe it's a loophole or cheaper to do that way idk just a thought
So basically the biggest thing people get with the copyright thing is that the original products are now free, and now you can reference them without fear of being destroyed on the court.  But just that, referenced it, I don't think we're gonna see Mickey Mouse in derivative works (like how Disney themselves do it with most of their work, ironically) unless Disney explodes, and the USA goverment ends up forcing a cease of all the trademarks.
haha superman horror movie gor brrrr
Is it just me or did MatPats voice sound a bit off at some points in the video?
guys, walten files episode 1 was reuploaded 1 month ago and there is things added that weren't there before the reupload. Matpat you should check it out.
How’d you know I do t have pants on 👀?
Lawyers wet dreams.
Whats that supposed to mean anytging amongst me is entertaining
Man, MatPat has had so much beef with Mickey Mouse. I feel so bad for Mat
Wait how did you know I didn’t have my pants on—
When shaggy and his friends enter the public domain whenever the day may be, oh man alot of potential for him to either fight with his meme powers or something nice can be made. The future sure does looks off in a way
I wanna see a theory episode on “No Through Road”
Do a theory on murder drones
I think you should get Daniel Greene for Mickey Mouse.
i deeply appreciate the kingdom hearts reference ('-')-b
time to make my own remake with mickey mouse.
Nailed it , about the pants
Oh Bother.
Lol loving this
Oh no, Kingdom Hearts. Good luck making a theory on that man, I've been a fan since chain and I STILL don't understand all of it!
Mark my words, in 2033 NBC will premiere a police procedual starring Bilbo and Gandalf... its inevitable
I think you should do a Daniel tiger episode I mean I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one that notices that there are some weird things going on in that show please matpat make a Daniel tiger's neighborhood theory because if you think about it every single friend family member and acquaintance Daniel tiger is just in his     mind
It would be funny if in 2028 someone makes a sequel to _Steamboat Willie and the only change they make for Mickey is giving him blue shorts... I don't think it would be legal, but it would be funny
Need to reform that law.  Call it the anti mouse law.  Force all copy rights to fall after the original 14 years.  AS it was INTENDED!
Matpat I indeed have my pants down at this moment, I don't appreciate you singling me out but respect you for it
lawfare is more damaging to civilizations than a bioweapon
I think he forgot to mention the part about that they could renew their copywrite.
The peter pan one if done right could be a banger
I didn't like this movie. Also the movie experience was ruined cause this one girl was talking throughout even during the silent parts and she didn't stop at al.
Hold on hold on, can't the public domain be held back by, say, reestablishing copyrights and such?
How did he did he know that I didn't have my pants on 😅
1:46 IM SCARED HE KNEW I DIDNT HAVE PANTS ON IM NOT JOKING
I guess it's time to call Souperman then
New fear unlocked 😭😭. Have you ever watched Boss Baby? If so can you do one. Because I realized if Tims imagination is so big that he can see dinosaurs outside he's window playing catch does that mean he imagined all that stuff that happened to him? I ask this because his mom in the beginning was pregnant.🤔🤔
Ummm they aren't pants. They're leggings...
this question might come out of no where and maybe a bit pointless to but,  maybe as a challenge to film theory can you figure out who is stronger; Goku or  Saitama  of course this is voluntary but its a challenge from me :)  it would be a nice theory :)
I would *so* watch Disney horror movies.
DC went one step ahead, if you watch their logo sequence you will know 😂
Wha- *how did mat know I don’t have pants on?*
Ha dude that steamboat willy on the disney logo intro is spot on.  That makes perfect sense now, I noticed they changed to that but never would have thought of that nice.
For a $100k budget, it was very profitable.
Ok, I understand this. BUT the original copyright protection was a buffer so creators could get money from a new creation while they work on the next. It was to almost push creativity and new creation. I don't care about what enters public domain. Its just perpetuating the constant reboot and remake culture that is bogging down current media. MAKE. NEW. THINGS.
The things those companies are doing with their trade marks makes me so angry, i want to do something with Superman when he gets in the public domain.
wait how did you know i dont have pants on😅
He called me out for not wearing pants and i feel attacked now
Will you even be able to use modern Mickey Mouse? Isn't it also their logo which would be different from it? Oh haha nevermind, MatPat has it covered lol.
Winnie the Poacher
screamed when i saw mickey
fax lol
Well guess what I’m never watching it,I am depressed by this.
He got me on the toilet 😂
Disney worst fear is cheap merchandise
Talking about trade marks, Transformers actually use certain characters names for other characters in their shows or figures so that they can keep the name even without using the actually character the name belongs to
I thought this movie was actually a game when I first heard it
You should do a one piece theory!
What about parity law
The issue with trademarks lasting forever is its own can of worms and not for the reason you're thinking of. Yeah money going to the Walt Disney family is fine for now but what about in another 100 years? 200 years? 500 years? If those laws are in place that far in the future then what you get is thousands of descendants getting very little money, which at that point you might as well not be paid anything. If the law changes and the money only goes to a company then that's kind of worse because then that incentivizes a trandmark aristocrat class in society.  Personally it (copyright & trademark expiration) should only be as long as 3 generations of the original creator.
Ok now I'm officially convinced he can turn anything into a theory.
Props to Mat and the team for bringing such engrossing theories
Wasn’t ready for matpat to discuss what my pants status was and I also wasn’t ready for him to be correct.
https://youtube.com/shorts/E0DLYCaZbho?feature=share
Remakes are not Disney’s worst fear.
So i have pants on, do i not get to access the public domain now
Not gonna lie, I kinda wanna see MatPat do a Film Theory on Battle For BFDI.
We are Winnies worst fear
The point isn't to make money or be a good movie it's to set a movement in motion.
so, maybe the movie is not so great, but the creators where smart
Watching a video on a horror movie right before I go to bed is probably not my best decision.
Here's great idea, Remove all laws related to copyright and trademarking, and rewire it so that only the CREATOR can use it, period.if I made a book and died, I am not going to benefit from owning it forever. Now the ownership can be passed down man to man, but only to direct to one down relatives, that way, all corporate entity's can no longer put copyright or trademark onto it's brand, they would have to perform unethical practice to get it. EHHH?
MatPat saying "Friendo" reminds me about A Heist With Markiplier with him in the cave scene.
Disney kryptinite it's.........ITS THE PUBLIC DOMAIN?!
How he know I didn't have any pans on
"yes, you sitting at home without your pants on" i feel like i'm being called out...
on your video on owo there is a commenter that is named uwu or wuw idk because i can't remember
The refusal to allow spin-offs of different genres has repeatedly killed characters, and franchises.  I would argue that Kingdom Hearts did more to revitalize Disney's old characters than any new Goofy, Donald Duck, and Mickey Mouse cartoon would have.
Didn't even know this existed until I have watched this
And here is what happens when public domain gets involved. We get these movies that someone only made cuz they could and they’re greedy AF. I just can’t tolerate these people tbph, or these movies which have no place in films. Make an actual good movie for once and then see how to do things! Don’t just pull one outta your bum! I just get very incredibly frustrated with people like this and want to know how in the world they thought this was a good idea!
1:47 That felt TARGETED.
A YouTube Pooper I used to watch, Pingy Poge, is known for having parts of his videos be narrated and detailed storyboards. Hypothetically, one of these, "P.I. Pooh: The Case of the missing Liquid Gold" would be possible to release as its own standalone work by 2024
It really should have been public domain 20 years ago
Kind of a relevant question.  What are the copy right laws if an AI creates a story/character?  Does the copyright go to the person using the AI at the time or the Corp. that owns the AI?
The power of the hate watch
1:42 - 1:50 bro really gotta call everyone out 💀
Bro how did he know I didn’t have my pants on
Winnie the Pooh grew up to literally become Jason from Friday the 13th this movie was similar to the Friday the 13th 2009
Film theory idea:  How much energy does it take to power the Cyborg's light cannon? -Teen Titans
GdT's take on Pinocchio is another example, as well as the new Soulsborne game "Lies of P."
2:35 The earliest Superman material is slated to enter the US Public Domain on January 1, 2034, NOT 2033. Your math is off, MatPat.
A Mickey Mouse movie in the style of one piece would be cool
Excuse me?! I am wearing pants. And you try wearing a bra all day, the girls need some freedom every now and then
Thanks Noah Webster!
1:47 how tf did he know I don't have my pants on?
I know there’s copyright complications with Peter Pan in the UK. It impacted Willingham’s ability to use the characters in his Fables series
this is great that Disney is finally falling off. ever since Walt Disney died, the corporation has been leading towards politics, Socialism and corruption. hopefully it’ll teach them to be more humble, grateful, and actually listen to the people instead of their own greed but I doubt it. All this “Woke” BS needs to die.
Bro did anyone else know test that this movie was in theaters
MatPat I know you probably won't see this comment and I will continue doing these till you see this . But If you do see this please do a theory on Murder Drones
bro already announced the like 6th channel
I heard about the copyright thing in a roblox video
bro sounds like the average boston npc
How long does it take to make these videos? Like, it looks like a lot of editing
I may have an unpopular opinion but I dont have a problem with Mickey Mouse not becoming public domain. Now if Disney was just sitting on the copyright just to prevent anyone else from using it then I would think differently. But Mickey Mouse was made for Disney by Walt Disney, and there has been constant Mickey movies, shows, toys, clothes etc... ever since his creation...... now Disney Co. gobbling up other IPs and not doing anything with them now thats a different story
Hey MatPat! I've been watching some videos about Moral Orel and I think it'd be cool to see your thoughts on it!
Disney couldn't deal with the threat of Steam boat Willie entering public domain, so they did the Ultimate Galaxy Brain move and turned him into a brand
off topic of the video but I found that someone wanted this to be a theory so i'm forwarding it to this episode. Theory idea: how much money do phineas and Ferb have. This includes all the same day shipping and other delivery fees.
Matpat literally taught me more about public domain, copyright and trademarks, than any of my schools could.
I'm not gonna lie, me and my husband literally got together over bad horror movies 🤷🏾‍♀️
Who else had a fear that someday this would happen I mean nowadays almost everything is rated R and horror related I mean for goddess sake they took Santa to far imagine all of your child hood characters murderers. It kinda makes me sad and scared!😢😱
Dear god, are they serious?  I thought this was a total joke! it’s a real movie?!
Just why would they make this.
Not even mentioning the fact that Mickeys very head is their logo
1 day ago? i’m so confused i feel like i have watched this video already
Happy 400th episode of film theory
No Disney loves china
Holly mother of pooh what IS THIS!?

Why public domain is a fair law:   - In several countries, copyright only ends after the creator of the work has died, and if it is a company, it takes 70 to 95 years to end, by then the company has already closed, and if it exists, everyone who worked on the company back then has died or left.   - Things like music, characters, stories, these are all just ideas, things in people's heads, you can't own an idea like owning something physical like a car or a house, if you make something, and someone takes it away without your consent, that's theft because you don't have it anymore, but if you make something and someone makes a copy, you still have the original, nothing was stolen, if you make a song, and another person sings the song without your permission, that person didn't steal anything from you, nothing was taken from you.   - Copyright is not even actual property, it's just having an exclusivity to copy, share and make public exhibitions, if you write a book, you don't own the combination of words, they have to pay you to make copies or adapt to a movie, but you can't go to stores that already have the books and force them to take them off the shelves, much less go to the homes of the people who bought the book and force them to have the books returned.   - Ideas cannot be locked forever, ideas have to be copied, expanded and improved, imagine if someone invented the cure for cancer, but kept the patent forever? The cancer problem would not be solved, a patent only gives exclusivity to the creator to become rich for about 20 years, then everyone can make the cure as well, with works of art, copyright lasts until the person dies.   - Even after LEGO lost the patent on the invention of LEGO blocks and a lot of copies appeared, they are still the market leaders, public domain does not prevent people and companies from using their creations, it just takes away the exclusivity.   - Copyright was created to encourage creativity, but with copyright lasting so long, it's holding back creativity, companies like Disney, Warner, Universal and Paramount own so many things that they don't need to create anything new, paradoxically, a big reason why Hollywood no longer invests in films with original ideas and only makes adaptations, sequels, remakes and reboots, the lack of public domain, allowing anyone to make them.   - It's impossible to create something 100% original, everything has to be based on something that already exists, in a world without public domain, we would eventually get in an era where it wouldn't be possible to create anything without violating someone's copyright, a world where ideas cannot be copied would not be more creative, it would be less creative.   - There are several orphan works, they say that if you want to use something that someone else made, pay the artist to use it, but there are cases where the artist has disappeared, you can't find him to pay a license, they don't know if he's alive or dead, or if he died, they can't find his family, and when companies go bankrupt, they sell all their works to pay the debts, and it is often difficult to know who the current owner is, the buyer may even have gone bankrupt too.   - This also leads to lost media, many works of entertainment were lost forever, all their copies were lost or destroyed and we can't enjoy them anymore, this is still happening even now in the internet age, many works cannot be distributed thanks to copyright issues, public domain is a great way to preserve media for future generations.   - Copyright became a mess, several companies are using it to censor people, and copyright rarely benefits the true creator of the work instead of the company that hired the creator, copyright lasting less would be a good idea to reduce this mess.   - And of course, companies like Disney and several others, keep taking stories from the public domain to adapt to movies, series and other stuff, and even put restrictions when people adapt these stories so they don't take things from their versions, but their original creations, they don't want them to go into the public domain.
Get ready for Lower Planet
Tigger 💀💀
Ok, we NEED a stop motion animated adaptation of the original Winnie the pooh
Someone is 100% going to make a horror movie based on all of the Disney characters 😂
I can't Wait  for all these characters to hit public domain but I also like the sneaky working around the public domain characters too
I was scared of Mickey Mouse as a four-year-old. Now I can see that I was onto something.
Company moment
1:49 somehow he correctly
Do a theory about the TikTok ban
I love it when you guys do horror movies
I sleep without my pants on
I literally don’t have my pants on
How are you allowed to have use images if they are copyright
14:48 I think those dashes are in the original book title and name of the character, I don't think I can get away with making a cartoon called Tra-Nsfor-Mers-. Trademarks have their limits, too.  If you trademark something as a logo for an animation company, that is mostly supposed to just mean that: Nobody else is also supposed to use the same image for a logo. Hardly like you can go Actually, people will confuse YOUR entire movie that has Mickey in it with MY animation studio. Because...that doesn't make immediate sense.  Another thing is When something is Public Domain it's likely to lose that kind of broad trademarking. That's why you can make a movie about Robin Hood called Robin Hood without being sued by the makers of The App Robin Hood.  It wouldn't make sense for them to own the trademark to something that anyone can use.  And look, nobody wants Disney to encroach on the public domain less than me, but I see these theories that like they're just remaking all their movies to retain copyright in some way or that they're changing their logo to lock down Mickey and I don't feel that that's necessarily what's going on. Disney did release a live action Pooh movie in the last few years but well...that was that. They couldn't stop anyone from doing anything with it, and I don't think they meant to. Disney's been using the public domain for years, thus opening itself up to competition  from lower budget animators drawing from the same well. Some are, I'm gonna say...not trying very hard to change Pooh's shirt, I wanna say.  It won't be too different. Sometimes they'll sue and be right, sometimes they'll sue and be wrong, most times they won't sue.
This has taught me that to do anything that's been copyrighted/trademarked you need to be the equivalent of a legal gymnast
The most ridiculous trademark to me, the one that shouldn't be a trademark, is for the terms "super hero" and "super-hero" (not sure if "superhero" is also trademarked--I've heard conflicting information on that).  Marvel and DC obtained the joint trademark for the terms, but trademarks are supposed to only apply to unique marks specifically tied to the company/companies.  If they become generic, the trademark is considered void (hence why Google doesn't want you to say you "googled it" instead of "searched for it").  Well, "superhero" (yes, the one I'm not sure about the trademark status) is not just a term applied to Marvel and DC, but to the genre as a whole, and regularly used to describe characters and stories from outside those companies (Spawn, The Boys, Invincible, etc.).  At least one spelling of that phrase should no longer be trademarked.  But considering who controls it (Disney and Warner Bros/Discovery/whoever is the one now controlling WB), there's a lot of money that can be thrown at any sort of challenge to the trademark, making it near impossible to actually stand up to them in this regard.  Besides, it's possible a joint ownership on a trademark also is a complication--I don't know, though, since I'm a layperson and have only personally never seen any other instance of joint trademark (they must exist, though, because otherwise I'd see people noting how weird it is).
Hey mat, i thought of a video idea. What if you try and figure out why hidan from naruto is imortal.
Pooh more like poo
1:48 I feel called out
Hey! I doubt y'all really take requests or suggestions (I don't even know if y'all read comments anymore lol) but I was wondering if y'all could do a video on Heathers? Not sure what it would be about, tho trying to figure out Jason Dean's mental illness might be a good one. Then again, with the premise of Heathers it might be hard to talk about on YouTube but it's just an idea :b
There is a place in Houston Tx called "The Hobbit Cafe". They have such gastric delights as the "Fellowship Platter ", and  "King Theoden's Burger" and of course a yummy veggie sandwich called "The Gandalf". The motif is definitely Middle Earth.  It's been around since 1972 and as far as I know the Tolkien estate has never said a word. Good food tho'.
hello matpat

Mickey and Goofy where stationed in Nam
I thought that the D in Disney actually was a G
The reason WHY this movie exists is probably money laundering😂
Film Theory Idea: He's No Hero (Shazam: Fury of the Gods
i have a question for matpat, if someone was writing a book and its characters mentioned and referenced modern day movie characters and scene and phrases within the story, would they be setting themselves up for potential trademark infringement?
since most of disney's og animations were based on public domain stories and fairy tales, i find this highly ironic
Hol up your using them in your video ain’t that copyright infringement plus you used that scene from Steam boat Willy ain’t that trademark.
11:15 I’m I the only one who heard Kermit?
I’m caught…I have no pants on 😳
there is a pub nearish to me called "the hobbit", which it has been since the 80's. when the film came out, the pub was taken to court by the film makers over copyright infringment. the judge ruled that as they had not intended to breach copyrite and its a nerd pub (D&D welcome) they were to pay a minimum fee of 5p/year compensation
This movie did not need to come out but I’m glad it did
In regards to the Walt Disney Animation Studios opening logo, it IS used in a creative manner, pages flipping with the final seconds of the footage being small and not taking up the entire background.
How do you know 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
...Yeahhhh no the only thing I got out of this is that it's high time we shut down Capitalism tm because give another century or two nobody will EVER be able to be creative again because every word every little design choice will be trademarked. The 'free publicity' given by fanfiction and knockoffs will also come with a $1000000000000000 price tag... #stopbeingacreativeoryou'lljustgetsued #bringdownCapitalism

This whole thing has made me question the legality of fanfiction and sites that have fanfics
Cocaine bear seems interesting I think I might just watch it
Every film theory I watch gives me a few more brain cells😂
how did he know that im not wearing pants
"you sitting at home without your pants on" that was shockingly accurite
Edward Bear is called "Winnie-ther-Pooh" and "Winnie-the-Pooh" in the text of the book, not "Winnie The Pooh" as Disney styled it, so the horror movie is closer to the original.
They make a horror movie based off of Mickey mouse club house it would probably be called Mickey mouse: slaughter house
Think of it like too far goosebumps but disney
Avatar: the way of the pooh 😂😂😂😂😂
In the TV show Ben 10, there's an alien named Rath. I wonder if his powers come from adrenaline?
That thumbnail though
"Yes you sitting at home without your pants on" HOW DID HE KNOW?!
1:49 I'm actually sitting on the toilet rn so this is very accurate
The modern copyright is disgusting
This is way off topic, but I'd love to see a theory on Osmosis Jones, and what kind of real world virus that Thrax could be representing. I think the movie is kind of hinting at Thrax being scarlet fever, given that Frank's symptoms start with a sore throat, the other germs are calling him, "muerte rojo" or Red Death, and he seems to be humming Peggy Lee's "Fever" in one scene. The problem with that theory being that he's referred to as a virus, and scarlet fever is a bacteria. So what virus looks like the common cold, and attacks DNA like Thrax does in the movie? Help! The internet needs Dr. Matpat, M.D.
I think there will be a challenge to Disney's empire and it wont go well for Disney. They will have to start competing with other companies to survive.

i heard the voice and for some reason heard Kronk???
slight correction mattpatt a name has to be unique and distinct and not already trademarked. If you want to trademark it. you can't just trademark a name say like Steven Henderson.
I feel called out. I’m literally using the bathroom while listening to this
Hey what about you make a video about the anime haikyuu and how is it possible or not for hinata (the main character) to jump this high even if his that short and  how hard can it be to him more then the other players or something
I really love Child Story Gone Horror because it just... Disney did it first in reverse.
I am offended! I was DEFINITELY wearing PANTS when I watched this!
Matpats congested listen carefully
Trade mark should end after 85,135,185 years after first being published and cannot being extended
For This Occasion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w73ALfzl8-A
Comment 13 please do poochie and pansy
The US constitution literally says that the copyright must be “a limited period of time” so trademark law won’t be able to override that
Would a show like Smallville be legal to make once Superman goes into the public domain?
How did you know I didn't have pants?
I forgot of this movie’s existence
There's at least one US legal precedent about how trademark isn't a substitute for a lapsed copyright (Dastar v 20th Century Fox, and disclaimer, also not a lawyer), but what the Disney cabal did is next-level diablerie, so good luck being the canary in the coal mine for that one.
1:48 me: is sitting at home without pants on 👀😳
I’m just now realizing that people are likely going to make and monetize pornography of these characters..
A lot of werid stuff is coming edit I lot of creative stuff is coming
I feel called out by my lack of pants. I like nightgowns...okay! 😢
Why did people even make that movie
So, in about a year, we can introduce a mouse named mickey into our stories?
As he said "Yes you sitting at home without your pants on" I was taking my pants off to use the restroom 😂
Hey Mat can you make a theory on how all the Adam Sandler movies connect
Dude it’s number 6 on trending. Good job man
Hey Mat Pat, I think you should talk sometime about the cosmic horror about the original scrip of Happy Feet Movie....I think it would be of your interest....just saying 😅
Hey, Mat! could you do a theory episode on the Netflix show Manifest? would really love to see and hear what you think about the series
Disney™
How did he know that I didn’t have my pants off😭😭
I donno if this is just me but I hate the idea that a Character someone worked hard to create can enter the public domain for anyone and everyone to use  especially if you wanted to ensure quality of movies and television created around the character, when that’s taken out of my control Anyone can make bad or awful movies around the Character that could hurt the brand recognition of it. Along with that, if I create a character  I want my family or company to own that character for a long time, I don’t want the general public to control it and be able to do whatever they want with it.
Does this mean I can't write a scary fan story about Bambi?
did anyone else realise that his voice changes abit at 11:15
they're going ham on this movie on letterboxd 💀
Does this mean silmarllion can be produced as a movie or series when it hits public domain ?
AND HAPPY GAMING :)

Yo the copywrite act of 1790 text looks like its staight out of AMSCO book lol
just to let you know MAT I do have my pants on!!!
My thoughts on the Bambi movie are.  SNL The Rock Bambi 2.
You need to do a theory on Muder drones by glitch predictions
(me sitting here without any pants) *how did he know*
I’m not gonna lie, ‘Bambi: The Reckoning’ made me laugh so hard I had to pause the video in order to collect myself. I had heard there may be a Bambi horror movie, so that in and of itself didn’t shock me. For some reason, the title just caught me by surprise and absolutely sent me
4:02 Not to mention massively extending the runtime of this video from approximately 18 minutes to easily several hours.  While I personally wouldn't mind that kind of ASMR in the form of you collaborating with The Legal Eagle to hash out the full international legalese of why Walter Elias Disney Enterprises is trying so hard to buy out other multimedia franchises to hold the copyright over them in perpetuity, most people surely aren't going to have the attention span required to sit through such a long video.
This is a message for Matpat ok so um every Every EVERY Video you show your face you always with your only pants you usually wear and that’s your jeans 👖 you stilll wear them even when exposing jeans on style theory but why do you wear jeans are they comfortable for you or what
public domain is a really cool thing though!! copyright stifles creativity
This isn’t going to keep Disney from suing the crap out of people even after their copyrights have expired.
bro realy had to call me out fr
You should do a theory on mr free man or more of what you think of it. Mr freeman (English)
During the time watching as I had no pants on I felt so called out.
Awesome! Same as  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfiaSGmd9R4
They need to recognize that too much of something is gonna go stale. Prime example of something that was on the rod and fell off is Marvel. Everyone wanted more and more from them until eventually now we DO have more it’s just not what we WANT. So hopefully this doesn’t go down the same vein of, say, something like Wrong Turn either. That’s tried to reinvent itself many times over and failed every time, I actually look forward to this sort of AU fan fiction type horror.
Rule 34 is gonna go crazy
I want to know how he comes up with these theories.
I watched the movie. It was like a fan film.   It was bad, but in the silly way you watch bad movies.
Matpat you are the best YouTuber me and sister watching your videos all the time:)
Matt you should do a theory on the show From. It has a crazy story
How much you wanna bet he’s gonna vining leaf
Mickey and Friends are trademarks though. So even if Steamboat Mickey does enter the public domain, Mickey himself will never be free to use.
Who want to own mickey mouse, I think most people in the future, want to find old Disney mickey mouse when they search after it?
Mickey has actually been in the public domain for a while.   The second Mickey film -- Plane Crazy -- failed to be renewed once upon a time.
what if you make it speed boat willie and he whistles on a speed boat
if all people can think to do is turn old characters into murderers or weird fetishes then i can see why the original creator wants to keep it locked down and away from the dirty masses.
Do an episode about filmcow’s shadow stone park serious
The end of Disney's domination of copyright law is a good thing, and acting like horror spoofs damage "beloved characters" is just silly. This whole video is just ridiculous.
Read McCauley on copyright.  A speech he gave before the house of commons.
It's the micky mouse, *slaughter* house! Come inside, it's *fun* inside! M - I - C - K - E - Y . . . M - O - U - S - E
I feel very called out when you mentioned the Hobbit fanfics... Also slightly honoured?! 😂😂
Man I wanted a video not a corporate commercial
I feel called out
Love how Disney would rather these extreme interpretations exist than multiple loving creators who want to add to the current iterations.
"You without your pants on"  Man how'd he know I watch these on the toilet?
Missed opportunity to brand that as legal weekend
ah... the member berries
This made me think about that one Mickey Mouse "cameo" in the game No Bodies: After Dark. They made an in-game joke about not having the rights to the character at all while "Morkey the Rodent" is clearly the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey.
that would explain Super man Red son and why dc made it so they can keep super man under wraps no matter what so they redid him in soviet style so no one else could
POV: still waiting for the next installment of the FNAF ULTIMATE TIMELINE video that was promised to us yesterday but hasn’t come out yet…
Matpat please answer this someday why don't people call Pooh Winnie?
It doesn't stop me to make a my own Sonic Webcomic named, Mobius Adventures despite that name is uses for a ROM Hack.
crazy
Amphibia theory????
Peter Pan is already a horror story, kidnapping children and keeping them captive on a far away island...?
HOWD HE KNOW I DIDNT HAVE PANTS
hey, Quick idea for a film theory. You guys should do a video on the owl house. The last episode comes out in two weeks and it would be nice for the show to get some recognition from you guys since it's ending way too soon. No pressure if you have seen this but it would still be nice.
Hey pants are the only thing I have on
Winnie the Pooh has always been this sociopath all along. He puts himself and his friend in danger all the time. Why do you think Christopher Robin's really left. Winnie the Pooh, is this dangerous creature who has been forced to live in the happy and friendly Thousand Acre Woods for decades. In between rabbit and Tigger, can you really expect someone to not go insane? The only one probably spared would have been piglet. He goes along with anything does, and Winnie-the-Pooh probably doesn't see piglet as a threat at all. And when you think about it hasn't Winnie-the-Pooh always been a horror show from the very beginning, if you look and analyzed every episode?
What is stopping someone from making an NFT with Superman and applying for copyrights to all digital variations? Since dc only has protection over movies tv comics  and physical products
Winnie-The-Pooh... with Patrick Warburton's voice!?  That would've made that movie better.
Disney and it’s creations nowadays ARE horror stories (lost world, Ms marvel, sequel trilogy, etc)
D&D in 2033 will finnaly have hobbits, I’m calling it now
I feel matpat is gonna make that Mickley mouse horror movie himself
Does that mean some fanfiction is illegal cuz like, if so i'm in big trouble.
1:48 “you sitting at home without your pants on”  Me taking a poop at that very moment: 👁👄👁
No, I watched this movie and it was so bad
Do one on blaze and aj
heh...mouse trap...
Be safe everyone ❤
Could probably still give Superman those powers because you cant really copyright those.  Flight, heat vision, and super strength aren't exactly rare powers
@7:30 This kind of response from society is an example of an "Emergent Intelligence" we are becoming so interconnected that leaderless societies will be able to lead themselves. However, this phenomenon can be exploited and weaponized like in the MAGA crowd.
Me: Minding my own business, starting the day enjoying breakfast, with a new film theory for a movie I have no interest in. 1:47 ; Dang it Matpat, you don't need to be calling me out like that!  LoL
Trademarks can depreciate another way, geniritization. Basically if the trademark gets so widely used as to no long differentiate the brand, look at Xerox. Granted this doesn't make the trademark disappear, it does however make them less enforceable, which in turn can lead to them expiring. That said companies know this, thus often get quite litigious, and/or particular in the use of trademarks if they fear one of their trademarks are at risk, look at Nintendo
Hello Matpat, your videos are awesome, I particularly like the fnaf series, I have a suggestion for a video, recently you've done Roblox horror game theories, so I recommend playing the Mimic the first book already has lore but the second book's lore is still unknown.
1:47 HOW DID YOU KNOW???
I wouldn't be so confident using Disney; Malibu Comics was found guilty after the "Law" was retroactively changed after Disney gifted your law makers to the limit permitted.
I love the simultaneous release of vids from 2 of the theorist channels.
Xi Jin Pooh is the worst
How he know I didn’t have pants on
Chill if Disney gonna stay way they are now they gonna destroy themself and all theit tm with them:).
Jokes on you, I had my pants on.
Disney worst nightmare is public domain
Future theory idea about the iron giant about were it came from 🤔
Libtards are the ones pushing to cancel Disney matpat,  not the Republicans, idk why you had to throw a political gab in your video, makes me not want to watch
Winnie the Pooh ? More like Winnie the public domain
Please don't make us watch Superman in a Marvel movie
Mickey, MatPat's other arch nemesis other than Springtrap
MatPat - Yes you sitting at home without your pants on Me - How did he know?
11:14 didn’t Mappat sound off?
As crazy of a legal minefield this is I'm still excited to see how new creative people will interpret these characters yeah some if not most will probably be bad but I'm sure there will be some gems in the rough
i felt a sore throat when i watched how walt dysney got in its way.
It either has to be a market that Disney won't touch like horror or R rated or adult themes.  That is the fun of it.  It is about winning against the legal system so Steamboat Mickey would need to be adult themed or pornographic.  The idea is to manipulate the system in such a way that dancing around the legal system's bureaucracy is fun.  So maybe a gun toting Steamboat Mickey for a presidential or congressional campaign would be something actually interesting.  Like I know how the legal system works, see this clip and this is legal.
Morgan
I look forward to someone like the EFF challenging Disney over the attempts to trademark Steamboat's Mickey. While the company can absolutely (and probably should) protect their branding and explicit logos, trademark isn't a replacement for copyright and they can't use it to try and copyright the public domain. If they start doing really underhanded things, they will be challenged and they will lose. Disney and every other company need to start picking their battles, because every year that passes means more and more control is taken away.
China had known this all along
18:05 are member berries copyrighted?
I feel like matpat was literally talking to me because I was in the bathroom watching this
How did he know I didn't have pants on
Can you do a video on Emesis Blue
The intros are getting better video after video.
I want matpat to do a owl house theory
Around the 11 minute mark you can hear Matpat turning into Kermit
Rude. I'm wearing pants... pajama pants, but pants none the less.
What happened to TM mean you cannot copy and the reason why off brand exists by copying the look with a few edits to avoid copyright law
The movie sucks because they took it WAY to seriously. Like, you're making a slasher based off of Winnie the Pooh.. If they made it a Comedy/Horror then I think it would have been great  That said the kills were pretty good
Please cover welcome home puppet show 😭😭😭
Is it just mean or did Matt sound different in this video?
Wait a second, this isn't cocaine bear.
Fanfics: if the names are good to go,  I can work with it
I think it's that Matt Pat has underestimated the internets ability to filp off big corporations
Horror movies: finally we can use these characters  Adult film industry: amateurs...
TikTok is getting shut down
Disneys worst nightmare is the public finding all those args on there is a yt channel which made an arg abt a bunch of kids who get killed by a girl in a mickey mouse costume, it starts with a new report and tells you the story The link: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xfr64zoBTAQ
Good God, there are going to be so many fan fictions coming out with these characters when their copyright expires. Now, I can survive not having to watch every single version of A Christmas Carol that exists, but for iconic characters like DC heroes, Hobbit, Sherlock Holmes, and Disney flagship characters, when everyone can use them anyway they like, it’s going to get really weird. But that’s the lifestyle of entertainment I guess. You make something, you can own it and profit off it, but eventually you will lose ownership, and then what you made can be used by everyone in anyway they like. It’s kind of sad when you think about it, but that’s how entertainment and culture works. There are so many versions of A Christmas Carol, Brothers Grimm tales, even Shakespeare, but these characters are technically more recent and have been the flagship selling points and face of corporations since the 1900s. Entertainment is changing, for better or worse, who can say. Change is coming right around the corner and fast, and if we’re all still here when it happens, we will bare witness to a new norm. But like I said, things are about to get weird, especially when you have DC Comics and a bunch of random guys making their own Superman stories.
😣 just create original content
My question is who checks if a product is breaking the Acceptable Copyright? Do companys have entire Departments who look at EVERY single product and see if they find Something?
can you please do a video on when disney tried to make a town called celebration and it went very wrong
Me watching this on the toilet “Yes you watching this with no pants”-MattPat

That's scary!
As soon as I found out this was going to be a movie I wanted to throw up...this movie was just disrespectful on so many levels
Explain yourself mat...       Where is fnaf?

Can you do a line of theory’s about the Studio Ghibli movies? Also a time line? The movies are beautifully made, they also seem to be connected in one or two universes just at different times
Pooh Fast... Pooh Furious... come on... The joke made it's self, and still you missed it... bruh...
We dont truly know exactly, it can be determined that its a bullshit tactics and never let them get away with it even if they demand
Hey matpat Why don’t you theorise about the series called spooky month by sr pelo because I have watched all of the episodes from 1-5 and I can say it’s got some gooood looore
So does brightburn not count as a copyright violation? (For those you don’t know it’s a Superman origin horror film)
What about the man of steel is that trademarked
why is your Channel named ""Film"" Theorist" even tho its the british version off move and you are Amerikan
Why is footofaferret using his Tom nook voice for pooh? POOH = TOM NOOK!?!?!?
*yes, you sitting at home without your pants on*   *Me, taking a dump* thanks MatPat...thanks... ☹️
Matpat can I point you and the theorist team to legal Eagles video the topic of Disney and others trying to utilise trademark and how the laws are on search of changing to prevent overuse of trade Mark in the future by major companies such as Disney and they have all been warned if I am understanding legal Eagles video correctly that they cannot just switch to trademarking everything
love the ace attorney references

is it just me or does this episode sound like someone’s doing an impression of mat rather than mat himself
the thumbnail reminded me of that bear from life of luxury
super-man is taken by dc
Where is the timeline?
I like this channel a lot
11:15 bro think he kermit
"Yes you sitting without your pants on"  😮😮 How did he know?
I never thought about Winnie the Pooh in that way before. This theory is really interesting and well thought out.
This movie is one of the worst i seen in years
1:48 😂😂😂😂
If they come for Moomins, I'm gonna flip.
Why is the Cars world (terrain structures and celebrities) so similar and behaves the same way as our world
Maybe they'll learn from their mistakes and make better movies... Probably not, but hopefully.
mathew paric 💀
This is probably also the reason behind many of the decisions in the Mickey Mouse (2013) TV show and it's continuation under a different name for some reason "The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse". Many characters like Mickey and Minnie appear closer to their classic counterparts rather than in their more modern look, and many older more niche characters make appearance who haven't done so in decades.   This probably allows Disney to keep a stranglehold on as many characters trademarks as possible just by having them show up for an episode here and there to show they are still "being used" by the company.

1:48  I just woke up and I'm already being called out…
I haven’t seen the film, but I’m p**sed, and they BETTER NOT touch the Lion King!!!
8:03 - a great example of this is the wizard of oz… while the film itself is not in the public domain, the book is
hey matpat could you di a video on eminis blue its a horror movie made from source it has a lot of work into it and i tink it could make a greare video also good video
I'm relieved this isn't a theory about the content of the slasher film itself. I almost skipped this one because of that. Films like that aren't great for a brain that likes to assign random reasons for anxiety at 3 am...
Trademark cannot be used to extend copyright.  See Dastar Corp v Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp, a Supreme Court case, which held that “plagiarism of public domain works is not a crime under the Landham Act, which requires only designation of the origin for the original physical goods, rather than the intangible ideas contained therein.”  As Justice Scalia wrote, “to create a species of mutant copyright law that limits the public’s right to ‘copy and use’ expired copyrights [would be] a species of perpetual patent and copyright, which Congress may not do.”
T i double gah er. That spells murder
it is nice that copyright law is explained in such an easy to understand way. thank you for this.
Day 1 of asking for a heathers the movie theory
I think Matpat should really see the 'Unicorn Wars movie'. It's honestly brutal 😳
They made a horror movie about the banana splits, soon they will do that fnaf spin off about disney
Jokes on you matpat all I’m wearing is pants
So basically we'll have to make them look and sound like parodies.
I liked the designed Disney Horror, but what I didn't like is that throughout the movie Winnie the pooh attacked more women than at the end he attacked men, and I didn't really understand the ending, does it continue with a part in the future?
i know all of it. 4:52 said "whatevere". from this i know that on january 2024 hes going to create the next theory channel called: "The Whatever Theorists". I knew it Mat
How did matpat know I didn't have pants on?
Why did it never occur to me that the Disney logo has a D in it 😂😂😂
there is already a horror movie version of superman: ever heard of the Boys?
Last chapter of Fanf timeline?
>"S shield crest" IT'S NOT AN S
wait it was real?!
I find it cool that I've seen a video (I believe from CGP Grey) talking about how copyright works so I knew everything MatPat was gonna say before he said it.
This film will either be really bad or, really good or, so bad it’s good
Matt pat ruining childhood since  2014
You do theories about Mark,you do theories about TV shows,you even did a video telling us that if the monstars were back in the new space jam movie they would be beaten easily!...but you never did a theory about MURDER DRONES...JUST..PLZ!!!
He just wants honey
Arn’t they working on “the mean one”
Interesting comment on humanity that the first creative effort of a common domain event is a violent slasher film of a previously positive creation.  Humanity can really be disturbing.
You kinda sound like odd1sout
OK.....I'm just gotta say this once.....and I'm not gonna say it again....matt pat...PLZ DO A MURDER DRONES THEORY JUST LIKE @Cartoon universe!!!!PLZ!!!
Disney's worst fear is a crappy try-hard edgelord movie? I didn't even watch it or see the ratings but could have told you it was trash.
Can u make up your own stuff or even go as far as e.g superman an just swap the powers so like heat breath an ice vision ??
Wha... HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT I'M NOT WEARING PANTS?!
those companies are crazy , DC comics sued the Valencia fc because is logo depict a bat that resemble batman one , the problem is that the football club was founded in 1919 and batman only apear in 1939
1:48 I feel personally attacked
mickey's first is crazy planes so crazy planes micky
Sorry, but I'd rather these ridiculous horror movies be hit with all the trademark and copyright laws so we never have to see their posters anywhere. There's no good in transforming children's media into things that exclude children. There are enough adults in children's media fandoms that don't know how to stay in their lanes and make the place child unfriendly.
Really enjoyed this theory and learned a lot!
The film/game theory intros are forever my favorite of any YouTubers. “Huh-hah! Yuh Betta believe it!!!” -Mickey Murder Mouse
Don't tell them
Omg i actually need to thank matpat for this. I thought i would be confused asf while he was talking about copyright and trademark laws, but its actually far from it. Seriously, Matt has a strange gift to explain things so well. Thank you for teaching me and keeping me entertained in the process. Peace.
Finally original works are coming back to life
I think a horror movie of super man would be good 💙
where is the fnaf timeline episode cos it's not here
Im gonna watch it.    Love it
Bro imagine a Marvel vs DC movie in the future
Please follow up with talking about Shrek/Puss in boots and chip n dale among others where it seems the studios are seemingly grabbing onto IP slowly in a weird game.
Bro, where is the last fnaf video , it was suposed to be yesterday
I'm Luna love goods son
Matpat: yes you, sitting at home without your pant on..  Me (watching this in my toilet): 💀
1:49 how did he know
France
Winne the Pooh 2 - Cocaine Bear.
12:46 Special Man "when everything is off brand" xD
Disney's worst nightmare is the public domain.
where is the fnaf video matpat.
Hey Matpat! You should check out Providingforthecommunity It's a pretty interesting.
We have the copyright tradmark on Game theory, we have this on film theory....si whats next for the 2 other channel?
If only Winnie - The - Pooh was The Cocaine Bear
WHERE Is the fnaf final timeline???
mickey becoming a horror movie... or video game. oh wait "Bendy and the Ink Machine" exists.
I knew it was gonna be hideous
Those bad horror movies' scripts already exist or in parts. It's called creepypasta. And there is a boat load of those around.
How did you know I didn't have any pants on????
they made a grinch horror movie
11:15 he turned into kermit
in copyright, you never OWN the work, stuff like character names and appearances are still ideas and owning ideas is a metaphysical absurdity. What you own is the copyright, the right to say who can copy or distribute the work. This means piracy is not theft, but trespassing, which explains why people pirate when it's convenient and stop when they can be redirected along another path.
The real question is whether Disney can sue the president of China for infringing on their Winnie the Pooh copyright?

11:18 mats voice changed
walt gisnep
Here's what the Copyright Act should actually be: 30 years from last use! Done and Done!
Thanks for including Australia for 19 seconds we feel included
I'm making a film about Poo Bear then it maybe 💩 and the critics will say it stinks but it will make lots of 💵💵💵
I think what Disney did to Star Wars is far worse than what this movie did to Winnie the Pooh.
I always enjoy watching your theories MatPat so could you maybe do another theory on Dumbo?
Thanks, Matpat. You just ruined my childhood.
"Yes you sitting at home without your pants on" Me looking down at my legs... "why you gotta call me out like that"
There is also coming a horror version of the grinch
Give us part 4
I like the idea of turning a kids characters into horror characters after the original fans turned 18+ .... But the movie was awful
Disney's worst nightmare is joe Swanson
And I am so down for a happy tree friends version of all the Disney characters if they're going to go dark and let them murder people
how did you know that i didint have them on 1:47
I mean, it's still worth it to use the characters in the safe ways, as long as they're recognizable. Though it might not be much more fun than just making the story you want in a legally safe way right now, like what The Boys does when parodying characters like Superman and the rest of the Justice League
The Mickey Mouse Murders - starting 1 Jan 2025
I'm actually kind of interested in the Bambi one maybe I just always saw Bambi as a dark film I mean they do open with them shooting Bambi's mom you go pretty dark from there
Picture this: Mickey Mouse, Slaughterhouse
dear mat pat , it's not actually micky mouse going into public domain , it's the steamboat wiley version of micky mouse
wherree is the next fnaf videoooo
If anything disney tryed to stop the horror movie.
1:48 you didn't have to expose me like that bro
wow matpat i love ur vids soo cool
Avatar the way of pooh
If blumhouse made a Mickey horror movie, I would watch it because blumhouse always makes good movies
winnie poo rule 34 ;)
We need a Mary Poppins horror film
Can't wait for Disney to start arguing that they deserve to own the copyright on works they "stole" for all of eternity, after all, they are just a small struggling company.
https://youtube.com/@3idiot-lb1gv
MatPat: I don't think you can use Superman the same anymore even if it reaches the public domain. Me: *Invincible flashbacks*
how did mat know iam not wearing any pants....
10:45 wait, is this confirmation of a new theory channel? I thought you’d stop after four because of you know the colours.
There is absolutely no need for the man to call me out like that.  I feel violated  P.S. This is me joking, I acknowledge that there was no ill intent from Matt Patt and he made a random guess to no one in particular
You people better not anything with Mickey next year
Lets gooooo this is number 3 on trending
the no pants thing freaked my insides out, won't wear my pants anyways
Bambie Horror movie actually makes sense and I'm expecting it to be like Watership Down
If you haven’t go check out style theory and check out these songs by Aaron faser Nash
Great piece, but the narrator comes off sounding like a 4th letter 15th letter 21st letter 3rd letter 8th letter 5th letter 2nd letter 1st letter 7th letter.
That Random Person Who Liked My Comments May You And Your Parents Live More Than 100 Years🙏🏻
ngl i wonder why they make a extra 70 years like will the creator rise out it grave and sue people who take it
Please Matpat do a vid on emisis blu such an underrated film.
I started watching this guy’s channel just six months ago and finished watching all the videos on film AND game theory and am working on style and food theory
this explains why dolph lundgen didnt have the skull on his chest
speed
How did he know i Don’t have pants on😂😂😂
Fascism....its called fascism.
This is why we need to abolish copyright as a whole. Forget about even a day of protection. You should not be allowed to put an idea or concept into someone's head and then tell them they cannot use it.
How did you know?
Do you have LetterBoxd?
What ever happened to Oswald. Did the house of mouse ever get him back?
That's the thing. People doing these movies aren't there to create a new product per-se. They do it because, in a way, is just fun to use these beloved, family friendly characters in ways they weren't deigned for. And it's even better when you can do it all in a legal way that just gives Disney the finger. And even if you have to contort the idea to traverse the Trademark minefield, it doesn't matter. You just need to make it recognizable enough for people to know what are you on about, and people's brains are great at filling blanks. And as you said, with the Internet is going to be very easy for people to know why certain changes were made. And no one is going to care. People see 100% what they want to see, and this is enough in this case.  So, yeah. I'm all in for this era of cheap but clever ways of giving Disney and all of these big corporations the finger. Artists will need creativity to pull this out, but thank God that creativity is where artists and trolls happen to excel at.
Me, bringing a mother freaking Nagant Riffle and when ever someone cursed looks at me “BANG” then they are dead ☠️
this is one of the times where we want these things to be copywrited
I'd look forward to the Peter Pan one... (since... to be fair; you could make an immortal kid raised by fairies that abducts other children when their parents are asleep could make a pretty good horror movie- ) but all else... feels sooo much like meatcanyon dude-  Also why does Matpat felt like he got stuffy nose midrecording- no offense tho--
Okay, How, tell me HOW Matpat knew I wasn't wearing pants
can you do a film theory on the tf2 sfm Emesis Blue?
I am at home AND wearing pants!
It would be awesome (you mentiomned that Peter Pan, Bambi and Pooh will all be part of a shared universe) if at the end of this group of films, Christopher Robin and some characters (like maybe a grown-up Wendy and a hunter or something) will all have to battle Bambi, Pooh and Peter Pan in one final gore fest.
I wonder what matpats and the crews iq is
Saying the US government won't side with corporations. Didn't pay attention to what the Democrats do to the Railway Works, and how the Republicans did not fight too hard to for them. Now we see the results of both parties on the side of corporations.
Ok but how did he know I was sitting at home without my pants on bro
Do anyone noticed Their voice change
Film theory idea. How did Matt Patt know I wasnt wearing pants.
OOH MYY GOODD ITS XIN JI PING
am I the only one who heard mat go kermit mode for a second in somewhere around 11:15-11:30???
Oh no... I think MatPat is spying on me... I actually don't have my pants on
Watch emesis blue
I've literally been saying this for years and mattpat put it in a much more cohesive argument. Thank you mattpat, we love you
Can we go back to the 14-28 year long copyrights for media? I'd rather see new stuff with franchises that haven't had anything done with them in years, even if they are terrible.
Could you do a theory on Coreline, please?
I love the settle shade they throw at 4:56 who on Youtube would try and copyright a word or concept?
Peter Pan has a huge potential as an horror movie if you know the true story
Now that I know about this, oh god I am thinking about everything that could happen in the future
Wow, Disney and the CCP have the same worst fear.  I am... less surprised than one might imagine.
Of all the sponsor this video could had have, Honey would be the most perfect. But I like to imagine they slipped out upon seeing you throwing jabs at the Big Mouse
Matt did you use an A.I. voice today? I swear, it sounds like that A.I. app.
Me after watching this video for a thousandth time because of recommendation loop....
1:48 .... How did you Know?!
To be fair, I don't mind a company owning their completely original characters until the end of that company's lifetime. Like, characters from fairy tales and books and whatever else? Sure, make them lose it, but the mouse and the crew? Let 'em keep those.
11:15 matpat turning into kermit
MatPat makes disney look evil and they are
The lifetime+70 year's is the rule in Germany too. I remember, when Adolf Hitler's book "mein Kampf" entered the public domain and everyone here was upset, that anyone who's looking for it now can find the pdf of this book on the internet.
I Dont know that Xi jing ping
Finding out the Mickey mouse would ever hit public domain at any point in time is traumatizing on its own 😭
Wait, Paddington was a stuffed bear? I thought he was real, at least that's what the movies made it look like
loopholes are fun to use untoil its a loophole!
Mickey is truly the og horror character
Sorry you saw me without  my pants but I'm taking a poop😤
1:48 WHO TOLD HIM
March 25 passed lol
This is creeper than your imaginary gf's face
who even want that creepy sh*t mouse in their story in the first place
You just lost a subscriber.
How tf did he know i dont have my pants on
MORE MINECRAFT THEORIES !!!!!
i wish i had this guys determination to upload videos, my guy has like 4 big channels and uploads constantly to them
Disney will fight to the death to never let anything goto public domain, I'm sure Disney will figure out a way to get extended again.  This is the new war, corporations gobbling up all the IP they can and trademarking everything around it and how will they get to it, They'll use AI to generate all the variations of it, use AI to generate all the legal documents for it so that the real lawyers just ave to proof read it all and then submit everything, within 5yrs they'll be mass submitting every idea they can. They have the money for their own in house supercomputer, to have the own local AI, to hire more legal people to proof.   Even if they don't use 99% of the stuff.  This extends to product design and looks too, we'll have these bigger companies in all areas try own every design they can create/think of. The Ai war has begun and the corporations will win a lot easier now.
Hey matpat,can I ask you something,can u pls do a theory around tana terrance cartoons? Since she s fired her self after making Amphibia and(my favourate) The Owl House
9:00 TIGER THE NIG-
Where is the finale of the f A.R. timeline it’s the 27th already u said that it would be up on the 25th
Day 2 of asking you doing a theory on Ena=]
That movie was terrible
MatPat were is my theory
I went from watching TF2 memes to watching this
I think you're kinda missing the point. yes you can only use what they had when they debuted. yes you can't use the same logo's etc. but you can add all original stuff! this is a good thing. you can make entire new things with old characters in the public domain. that's how disney made snowwhite and basically any other animated movie in the first place :)
Legal loophole -  Superman can’t fly but he can throw himself with his super strength after leaping to the height of a tall building
I'm pretty sure Winnie's name was spelled like "Winnie-the-Pooh" in the original books
17:50 There already exists a movie that gives a different take on tge Superman origin in a horror movie.  Brightburn it is called I think
Disney's worst nightmare is straight people
MatPat really can't help himself when it comes to horror bears
1:47 oi how you know I have no pants on
What about game’s characters and different seasons like overwatch and apex legends
I’ve considered watching the Poo movie just as a screw you to Disney
Hearing Matpat say my last name is a weird, especially seen as he said it right, and you'd be shocked at how little that happens.
Me wearing pants and thanks to that Not owning Winnie the Puh  The good Thing is, to write a good Story, that gets accepted, you should never Just Copy stuff directly
I actually like all this. It really forces you to make public domain characters more of your own thing.
I JUST SAW THE :  STYLE THEORY
STYLE THEORYYYYY
1:47 I feel attacked.
It’s funny that I can understand both sides. I get wanting it to be fair for everyone, being able to use characters and the like. But at the same time, I understand that creators and their companies don’t want their characters to be butchered.
So we just gotta stop giving megacorpos infinite trademarks, got it.
Super/Man perfect nailed it :)
Noo not my child hood
I feel called out
17:50 already there's a superman horror film called BRIGHTBURN made by James gunn you should talk about it whats your opinion guys
This was soo interesting!! Honestly gotta give it to Disney for their creativity of getting around it and still protecting what's theirs
Yeah, the estate of Arthur Conan Doyle abused the whole "You can only use iterations of the character before X time" hard when it came to Sherlock Holmes. Holmes has been in the public domain for a while now, but Conan Doyle Estate still tried to control Holmes by arguing that because the versions of him that had him present more emotion were still under copyright, you couldn't write a story with Holmes showing much emotion. That caused, for example, Great Ace Attorney to be delayed coming to the west for a long time, because their version of Holmes is very expressive and emotional.
Sorry buddy. But the idea of style theory still seems pretty dumb and not sustainable
make a film theory about embryo wallace
How did he know I had no pants on, where at matt
1:47 HOW TF DID HE KNOW
C R
I am a youtuber🔥🔥👑 your nice video
1:45 how did U know I was watching this on the toilet and just got called out
Pooh has had enough of communist chinas crap
Matt actually had such a good opportunity to use the the Fine bros “react” trademark attempt to help explain why you can’t trademark ideas like “theory” 😂
1:47 This scared me more than any horror movie because I actually just got out of the shower and am not wearing pants.
Yeah I'm an intellectual property lawyer and you guys actually nailed this nice
The thing that annoyed me the most is how boring it was. Without the Pooh Bear mask it is just another far-far-less than average slasher flick, but people saw 'Horror'  and 'Winnie the Pooh' in the same sentence and couldn't move fast enough.
I did not like Poh horror movie
...uhh did matt's voice/voice quality change halfway through the video?
Can you do a theory on what would happen to earth if it had 6 moons like the anime reincarnated as a sword
I assume Fashion Theory is just a way Matt is trying to get back at the industry that sued him for infringing copyrights at this point.
did his voice changed????? 11:14
How did bro know my pants were off 💀💀
Shazam fury of the gods theory pleeeaaassseeeeee
How you know dat
I'm watching this in the morning with a hangover as he says "yes, you sitting at home without your pants on"  and for no reason that line killed me
Ooohhhh no I'm getting ideas And I don't like them
were is part 4 of ultimate timeline
With or without legal loophole the fact that Disney is crumbling down is  worth  to celebrate just yesterday me and my friends celebrate Disney's well another worst live  action movie. It's simple really copy write can make you poor and well sentence in the cold and inanimate object called jail in term you commit the unforgettable sin called plagiarism then say bye bye. While the legal loophole can basically be in a nutshell term "once they found something weird they can slap you with a heavy mallet". Basically if Disney find something worth of value to well reclaim the rights to said product they will exploit it and make you way poorer and in jail.
Get ready, 2024. My new hit novel "Wow, what a super man!" is coming.
The low budget movies actually have a huge market. It's more about having the off brand with so vague information that you think it's the right movie.
So ..after 2024 is possible to make kingdom hearts 4 without all the copy right problems ?
We still need cocaine bear sequel theory
🤓🤓
Bro I’m gonna make a horror movie about Tigger and Roo. Roo be punching holes in people’s chests, punching heads off. Tigger be tail whippin’ people, choking them with his tail, bouncing on their lung. Lmao.
This was a great law course
If you REEEEEALY want to know what a mess copyright and trademark can be, just talk to a Captain Marvel fan over the age of 40.
BEST POOH EVER! Well done 👍 let him COOK!
I was honestly hoping for theory based around the actual movie, as it would've been  the perfect duo of destroying childhoods!
Hey Matpat (sorry if I wrote that wrong) could you please do another anime Theorie?
you gotta love copyright laws: can't protect artists from getting their art being fed to AI, but boy howdy can they protect corporations from getting their characters used in creative ways
MICKEY THE MOUSE.Does Disney own that, I wanna make a movie called Mickey the mouse ORIGINS
Please Do a theory on emesis blue
12:45  That's what "Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier" did. It's a parody of Aladdin with lots of references to other disney movies (my personal favourite is the exchange between Ja'far and Princess where Ja'far says 'prince Erik seemed nice' and she replies with "he fucked a fish!")
11:17  Hey mat, ya doing alright over there? Sounding a little like Kermit
NOT THE SOUTH PARK MICKEY MOUSE
I didn’t think movie was that bad tho it was ridiculous but wasn’t bad
A ceo probably  “ what you fail to understand is that we are not a character company… you see what we are is a trademark company” 😂
13 h.
But the horror movie guys cant copyright pooh right?
HOW DID YOU MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE AVATAR THE WAY OF HONEY LIKE COME ON
1:48  I laughed because I’m actually wearing my pants this time and eating ice cream hahah.
I have pants!
Wait but why can’t Disney just renew the copyright
matpat please can you also mack vids about naruto
I've... Never disagreed with matpat more than this moment. Not on the copyright/ trademark stuff, that was very well done, but on the idea that writers should just create their own work and not try to make works out of newly public domain material.  The act of expanding a work with new ideas and material has been with us since we came up with myth. Art by its very nature is dependent on the audience as well as the creator to find meaning. You can see it in the devoted fan fiction community, in the fan posts theorizing and fixing plot holes and characters, and the ocs and world expansion to make a story into a universe.  Young writers are placed in a precarious situation where the worlds that drove them to write and build could harm them legally. Where people trying to develop their skills have to start from scratch instead of drawing from the tools thier culture and interests provide. Think of what the world would be like if we couldn't use elves or dwarfs in our stories? If the works of Lovecraft were gated by an estate? If the dang pantheon could bring a multimillion dollar lawsuit on your head.  We can see right now with lore Olympus, with the multitude of Sherlock homes works released *before* it fully went to PD, with every single work that uses the word Cthulhu, and with the classic monsters like dracula that having these already established stories are so important.  TLDR: "just create your own original work that can compete with the company that LITERALLY started out making movies from public domain works" -Matpat
Shouuldn't we fight this, like we should fight to lower the public domain. I know, I know the mouse would fight to his death for it. But we gotta try.
wow matpatt, howd you know im not wearing pants? is there a channel called hack my tv theory????
Honestly I don’t think turning a character that people love, such as Winnie the Pooh, is a bad idea. It just needs to be done right like violent night is Santa gone violent or the princess is the same but a princess version and those movies aren’t bad but I think Winnie the Pooh was just the wrong character to turn into horror.
3.8 million off $100k? Hot dang no wonder why they're making a sequel they'd be crazy not to try a second time (And hopefully do it better.)
1:47 I just about spat out the chocolate i was eating because i was not expecting to be called out like that…
Cuase it's a SLASHER! 😂 It's a cheap B film like most movies.
Is this Disneys worst nightmare or Xi Ji Ping Pongs worst nightmare
Let me tell you thay you have some people that still your videos so i am going to get that copyright in their eyes
The sequel is gonna flop hard lol.
No lie I’m interested in that Peter Pan
i would love to see some mathew paric theories in the future. Underrated youtuber fr
Love how fanfics tend to sidestep stuff like this; at least not that I’m aware of otherwise ao3 would be a legal hellscape
They've already done low budget(kinda) horror Superman in the movie Brightburn.
Copyright/Trademark Law. Is. BULLSHIT.
Excuse me, I just want to point out that on 12:21 you say "toy doll figures"... In reference to Superman... It's an "Action figure"... Thank you .. 😂😂😂
I feel like this is my favourite episode yet
Great theory on this one. In the case of Mickey, sure his copyright will up soon, but I feel like the only value Mickey has is the value Disney has given him over the generations. By all accounts, he's Disney's OC & even if someone wanted to use him in some form, he's so synonymous with Disney that it wouldn't matter. I'd argue that time would be better spent trying to recreate Mickey's success rather than find a way to use him when he does become available.
How did he know i do not have pants on...
Not "Just a Theory" literally just state what Disney has been strategically doing for decades. They are the enemy of free creativity and art. There is a reason Dream Works creation was literally out of spite for Disney lol.
KH2 came out in the US in 06, and that ALSO feature Mickey from the steam boat willy era. It is also a 3D rendering of it which may count as the start of the copyright of a 3D version of thay style of Mickey.
Bro really just outed me like that
Adults need to stop ruining things meant for kids. It's lame and unnecessary. None of our lives are made better by this existing.
1:47 "Yes, you sitting at home without your pants on." *looks into the camera like I'm on the office* How do you know, Matthew?
2:02 i feel like "pooh fast Pooh furious"? would work better lol and "the pooh of water"? 😂😂 they seem like 2 that could be in the same universe
I like that Poppy ended up so interesting/popular that the protype has become the universal theorist signal for "puppeteer" XD
how'd he know I'm not wearing pants💀
Ohio state trademarked the word "the". That's how stupid the trademark system is
Mickey mouse creepypasta movie when?
1:49 bro called me out! So what if don't wanna wear pants?!!! leave me alone! Im alone in my own home! 😅🤣🙃
Basically, whatever's public domain would be turned to fanfiction in the big screen.
Mind if I ask? How did the Fnaf fan games ‘treasure Island’ and ‘Obletis Casa’ get their right to use Disney characters?
17:52 Why do we needs a horror movie Superman, that's Brightburn. That already exists, he's just not called Superman.
I’m real excited for it
1:48 You're right
Are Superman and Clark Kent two different characters? Does that play into the copyright ©️ and trademark ™️  Can I use one but not the other?
Do a film theory on Free Guy!!
I have two things to say:  1: I watched a slice of life movie at school and it became a horror movie when a winny the Pooh monster tryed to drag a child into a lake and was never brought up again after that  2: if movies gave their characters to the public then R34 people would have a field goal with... EVERYTHING even though fan fiction and R34 have been doing it for Years so this doesn't really change anything other then you can now make a full official movie and TV show with the characters :/
Any updates on the fnaf timeline?
it was so good!!
Do a film theory on Saitama's workout regime!
Was it an indie company or (a) filmmaker(s) that made this garbage?
The only Winnie the Pooh film not made by Disney (also the only one from where the original source was made)!
Steamship Killy coming out in 2024
EEYORE has always been a depressive, make him bipolar 😂
This video has nothing to do with the movie
not mattpat actually calling me out for sitting at home without any pants on... he isn't just a theorist but a genius and magician(and top youtuber)
This is just scary for me
Considering everything about the original Peter Pan, they aren't going to have to work that hard to turn that into a horror movie. I mean, he killed lost boys if he thought they were getting too old, cut off Hooks hand and fed it to a crocodile, he takes children and whisks them away to another world with no hope of anyone finding them or them escaping as they are on an island in another freaking plane, your only escape is magical flight, the inhabitants are either hostile or passive at best, and to top it all off, Peter Pan is Chaotic Neutral with an ego that size of Never Land.
Who ever asked for this????
murder drones pls
How'd he know I didn't have my pants on 😳
murder drones
Although this might be true, copyrights should not expire. They are original work and therefor the law or any other authority does not have the "Right" to take it away and who ever came up with copyright expiration any way?
murder drones
Oh my god when Matpat showed the Updated logo for Disney I just got mindblown. That was terrifying
murder drones
murder drones
murder drones
murder drones
murder drones
murder drones
murder drones
murder drones
murder drones
Disney sued and threatened a childrens hospital for having a peter pan themed room/playcenter to help the kids cheer up and socialize even though they were using it based on public domain and werent even using the disney characters.   Its nice seeing someone use the public domain to scare disney like this
But you can use Mortimer Mouse cousin's of Mickey
Waiting for papa Matpat to talk about what’s going on with tiktok
I'm not surprised when "Supermean" toys start to show up
concentration camps in chyna ahooooooooy ~~~
Can I still make a cartoon character named " Mike E. Maus"?  He's a teamster from New Jersey who doesn't know how to whistle and his pet dog is named "Jupiter".
Valerian and a city of a thousand planets
I want him to make an actual theory on the movie.
Yooo how did you know I didn’t have my pants on!?
I don't like this :( i hope this won't be seen by some kids expecting to see the kids version of something
Why does poo bear sound like Joe from family Guy at the beginning
Mickey Mouse is actually a psychopath. The friendly side is what we see as the public.
When you don’t have pants on 😶
"The superman"
I watched the Winnie the Pooh horror for the laughs. 10/10 entertainment, couldn't stop laughing, specifically that scene where Pooh whips Christopher with something that looks like a long wig.
Sure it’s probably not a good idea to use Steamboat Willie, but what about plane crazy?
Anyone noticed how the voice kinda changed at 11:19 in this video? Or am i crazy, the voice sounded a little bit more... if you added a lil goofy to the accent, making it seem like it didnt change, but im pretty sure it did
now i’m just confused how MatPat ended up legally using the logos and stuff in the video
Epic
Ahh I'm watching with my pants 😅
im only 5 minutes in so this will probably be explained but cant you just renew a copyright? isnt that the point of copyright? you keep rights over the project for as long as you can so we renew the copyright…? or is that just a very simple seeming fix that i just made up in my head cause i thought companies were doing that since forever
Embrace the hyphen, rule the world...  A horror Super-Man alien invasion flick would be sick!
Brock Samson? Scare Bear?
MatPat sounds sick this video
If your movie makes back several times the amount of money you put into it; I'd call that successful.
Quick question. Why are YOU able to use these things in your videos? If you could get copyright struck?
The fact that i dont have pants on right now, MatPat has cams on me
I swear if he makes another channel like: Welcome to LAW THEORY!!!🤣
1:43 HA! I am wearing jeans in bed because I’m too lazy to take them off.
Copyright and trademark only last as long as the countries willing to enforce them...I'm just saying.
The final ultimate fnaf timeline episode was supposed to come out yesterday yet you waste our time with your DIsney hate fetish
Is that Patrick Warburton in the beginning?
I'm just now noticing but when did the theorists stop using intros?
1 : 49 how did he guess lol 😮
I wonder when The Lion King will enter the Public Domain, and if or when it does, I also wonder what people will do to it... also, if it will be worse than the 2019(?) remake.
1:48 how did he know
I can't tell if parts of this video were voiced by AI or if they were recorded at a slightly different time when Matt was sick? little concerned
glad matpat acknowledged the Disney "G" I thought I was the only one 😅
“Yes you sitting alone without your pants on”   HOW DID HE KNOW TF
So does the Asylum trademark or did they steal James Cameron's Titanic which is his copyright of 1998
Could pull a brightburn
Now this is diversity.
Matpat ik this is the wrong channel but you should make a theory on world of goo. That game is so nostalgic for me and I was always really confused with the lore so I would love to see you make a video about it.
Dam can't wait to see whiney - the - pooh in 2090
Anyone else think the other guy at the begging of the video sound close to kronk
I felt called out as soon as he said "You sittin at home without your pants on" Like, thank you, but I at least have a blanket covering me
say what yall want i actually enjoyed the movie and got some good chuckles
Another great theory MatPat, just love your channel . 👍👏❤️
When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was convinced it would be bad.
how’d you know my pants were off…
You should do welcome home
How do you know I am not wearing pants
Why didn't you upload on game theory
Me who saw this video, and may or may not take a lot of characters from different franchises and put them in my imagination without thinking of the duration of copyright expiry date: ...Well, frick.
If you haven’t already u should watch the movie “incantation”
ok I am legit not wearing any pants how did you know that?
This explains so much how Brightburn became a “Superman” villain origin story and they still were able to make it without problems. It wasn’t the best movie but at least I know how they were able to make it. Thank you Film Theory! Learning a new thing every week!
I am all with matpat here, but am i the only one who was a tiny shocked that he pointed out i had no pants in the bathroom-
It's ok for mega corporation to steal from public domains. But when we try to take it back we go to jail.
Yeah, I’m not too worried about the trademarks. So long as you have a creative enough mind to navigate around that potential minefield, you should be safe. Having public domain characters appear within the text of the story is typically the safest route around it.  The trouble is, if your idea is copyrighted, it’ll prevent anything too similar to it from being made. So… you could be creating another barrier.
11:15 is this AI Matpat? Can someone explain what happened here in the voiceover?
SUPER MAN !
Bright Burn?
About 10 years ago - I noticed seasonal trademarks on Pooh.  Disney TMed “Winter Pooh” etc.
Bro where is the fnaf theory in game theory
1:47 "yes you sitting alone without your pants on" dang Matt- wasn't expecting to get called out today
south park reference
This is interesting 🫠
Marvel and DC play a montage of their most iconic characters before every movie into their logos, wonder why........
I think its is okay to companies to keep their ips so that the work they have created will not be stolen
..
1:48  how did he know
You should check out battingtons video “my two front teeth” it might have something to do with harmony and horror
1:48 I'm fully dressed in jeans and huddy at 1138 pm
How did he know my pants are in the floor😭
This was one of the worst films I've seen in years.
Everybody gangsta till Mickey mouse pointer becomes legal
Yes, you not wearing pants while I was thinking about to get off my pants😂😂😂😂😂
Mickey will never be on public domain. Every year they extend the date to next year
Then how does fair use, parody, and wish knockoffs work?
Meet my newest super hero   The Crypto Knights!!!!!  Coming in 2047
Does anyone know when Scooby do would enter the public domain.
"Hello internet, welcome to film theory, the show that wants you to maul that subscribe button like a rabid bear looking for hon-" *CEASE AND DESIST"
is it just me or did matpat shift his voice a little before 11:50 (too lazy to check exact time period)
Please make a south park theory about kenny matpat < 3
Disney's worst fear is not being able to sue someone for using their music from 50 years ago
So basically at this point public domain could possibly be not a real thing at this point aka public domain could possibly be a lie at this point?😑🙄😓🧐😓🤨
I hate the creator of the winne the pooh
I just literally got called out for not wearing pants 😮
Stop delaying the inevitable, Matthew Patrick.
Do welcome home
3:33 You are not wrong in the slightest MatPat
When are you releasing the Fnaf timeline?
1:48 *looks down* Dang MatPat, how did you know I wasn’t wearing pants?
So where can I watch it
Sorry to break it to ya but this video has almost nothing to do with the movie
You need to take a look at the show “from”
How did he know I didn’t have pants on?
11:30 I've been reading it as Gisney (jizney) my whole life. Thank you for pointing out how bad of a D that is.
You know your movie is bad when mat-pat would rather talk about legal loopholes then theorize about your movie.
Has it been released in China? Xi will love it
Imagine if Marvel and DC become public domain we can make our own MCU and DCU
How can a bear be a jackass? 👌
E
I'm going to make a horror film about Spider-Man
I don't know how to feel about public domain. On one hand, it's nice that everyone has creative freedom to add something to a franchise, but on the other hand, they could end up disrespecting the original source material and creating something that never fit with that franchise. Just look at Rings of Power.
when is the new fnaf timeline vid coming out??
I forgot they were talking about this movie back in 2022
What really gets me is people have been attempting to copyright literal body movements for decades. THIS NEEDS TO STOP. i'm beginning to think the people at Shark Tank like bringing such fools onto their show just to watch monkeys dance from time to time as they know it's an easy "no, we're not backing such a thing we're not stupid thanks for the free entertainment."  So i have this really cool idea, if anyone squats down raising their arms behind them they owe me a million dollars or whatever my legal team says they owe me yes this will be BRILLIANT!!! i just need someone to back my idea to get it copyrighted i know i'll talk to the SHARK TANK people MWHAHAHAHAAAAHAAA!!!!!!! (joke)
A comic of Magnificent Man and his trusty sidekick Ricky Rat.  I wish this was a collab video with Legal Eagle though 😔he's a Super Lawyer
I'm exited for these free domains, for me the best part is finding loop holes in the designs
Disney's worst Nightmare is themselves! Quickly becoming their reality too!
This movie is wild.
When I saw the trailer drop, the irrational part of my brain was convinced “Disney is bankrolling this to make the public take their side against Mickey Mouse entering the public domain”
So we should all think up new i.p. GENIUS!
hey man, you don't need to call me out on my lack of pants...
How bout a theory about the amazing world of gumball's clown and why this clown is always looking at us? Ive always noticed this creepy detail but i can never seem to find a fitting story behind it.
Peter Pan is link but magical
the only horror here is your correct assumption that i don't have my pants on
Ple
Do 44cat
11:14 what happened to mat pats voice?
Let's see, who would win: Evil Winnie the Pooh or Freddy Fasbear?
Hello! can you do a theory That why doesnt Kanga have a disorder in winnie the pooh? Id be happy to know!
Hey Matt, I enjoyed your video, but I have a problem with it. Similar to your recent SCP video, you talked about trademarks. That’s okay, you explained more info on an well unknown topic. However, you also linked popular franchises to this media. It’s true they connect the trademark explanation to the game/movie, but I wanted to see a theory on those franchises you connected them to. I watch your content a lot, and just a little disappointed that you didn’t do a theory on them, but (a good one) about trademark. I do want to say that I did not watch this movie and don’t really understand a whole lot about SCP, but I come to your videos expecting you to describe and/or promote a new franchise. I never could’ve been a massive fan of FNAF without your theories. Thank you, Matt. (Also, if you actually read this comment, could you tell me if there’s not any strong theories for the Pooh movie or the SCP franchise has too much content to narrow one thing to theorize about? Thanks.)
Is that Patrick Warburton - Joe from Family Guy - as Winnie the Pooh I hear?
How tf did you know I had my pants off?! 😮
I am scared now... How did Matt Pat know i didn't have pants on 😂😅
I came for a theory and I learned about copyright. Honestly good information to know and I watched all of this out of pure curiosity. ✋😂
Wait, I’m confused. So, if I write a story about Winnie the Pooh, I don’t need to use hyphens unless his name is in the title?
Heres one you might find interesting, who owns the TV rights to the 8th Doctor of Doctor Who fame? Backstory, after the original cancellation of Doctor Who, the BBC wanted to bring it back but also gain an American audience. So the BBC signed an agreement with FOX who would own the TV rights to the 8th Doctors' likeness, where as BBC owned the character (this is why whenever the BBC did anything with the 8th Doctor, it was either an online short, comic or audio drama). As we all know, Disney bought everything to do with FOX, with the exception of FOX news and some sports thing. So does the TV rights default back to the BBC due to the deal (I doubt as they have shown they are happy to use McGann but haven't brought the 8th Doctor back in the aired show) or more likely, does Disney now own the TV rights to Doctor Who and what does this mean if they do?
I zoinked that little jab at Fine Brothers tryna copyrighting the word *“REACT”*
1:49 I literally did not have pants on in that moment. what
This movie had such potential. Too bad it was hot garbage
Thanks matpat this is crazy Christ bless you
Why Pooh look like a JR's animatronic
MatPat calling me out. Yes, my pants are off. Hard to poop with them on. At least without making a big mess....
My favorite legal loop hole is . . .Not making money off of stuff. . .
Dude how did he know that I don’t have pants on
Hey, they succeed to make u talk about the movie. Bad marketing is also marketing. Yeah.....
MatPat chose violence this week
I’ll just throw that middle school super man s doodle from middle school on him
I despise the Disney company 😊
Lol
10hs
10hs
PLEASE do copyright theory!!!
10hs
10hs
10hs
The limited powers of the Golden Age Superman can be an interesting concept
Series I feel Mat Pat should make Film Theories on * House of the Dragon (who is the rightful heir) * Adventure Time (why the Mushroom War happened/the true nature of the Lich) * Futurama (is Fry being his own grandfather possible?!)
I’m taking a poop as watching this how he know I don’t have pants on
dude mat pat shut up man i thought this vid was gonna actually be interesting with u telling us about what happens in the movie.
Anyone who hasn't watched all episodes of Mickey Mouse believe me that thing already is weird I don't know what public gonna do with'em
And disneys worst enemy is the woke garbage
Now you gotta do a theory vid on The Grinch's new horror film, "The Mean One"!
At like 10:50 why does he sound so different I'm so confused
Considering Bobby Driscoll died addicted to heroin and penniless because of Disney, I’m okay with them making a slasher film destroying Peter Pan’s fun innocence.  Rest in peace, Bobby. You deserved better.
I LOVE CORPORATE GREED 😆😆
aint no way bruh
1:47 man he didn’t have to call me out like that
learned about this from someone talking about how harry potter would have gone into the public domain with some of those older laws, but it’s good to see matt spreading the info to a wider audience here. gah, i just wish people were allowed to be creative and not be afraid of the stupid mega corporations like disney and WB.
I mean, this is why Herlock Sholmes exists. Sherlock, as we know him, cannot be used because of these ideas, but then someone got a really good idea to make a knock-off Sherlock who was much more like later depictions of Sherlock. Thus, Herlock Sholmes became the main-stay name for "Sherlock, but not really" characters.
Willy’s Steamboat Slaughterhouse: A horror movie about a monochromatic mouse who pilots a steamboat through a spooky haunted swampland killing all who unfortunately gets lost in it.
How about why/how the release of this film was mysteriously cut off in Hong Kong?
so in other words we cant use a hppy go lucky mouse in red shorts... but we can use a happy go lucky mouse in overalls, and sailor hat, who pilots a boat...... and uses it to murder people..... good to know edit: forgot he had always been in shorts... but funny how I had a similar idea Mat Pat had at the end of the video XD
Matpat makes me happy even though I didn’t place in state at wrestling
Wow so they just monopolized an idea huh. Human is beutiful. Very very beautiful
They should make more rated R or pg 13 Disney movie Fr
Yo matpat, ready to upload your most controversial episode of the fnaf timeline tomorrow? 😈😈😈
So this is probably already been done to death but what about theoretically that the road runner is fast enough that it is able to vibrate its body at the right frequency to phase into the 1st dimension and that is why he is able to run into the flat side of the wall but wily Coyote can't do it.  Just a thought for when they become public domain.
Here comes Michael the F*** Rat
MatPat: Yes you sitting at home without your pants on! Me:**glances down at my pj pants**
As much as I love the idea of a dark Pooh bear, I didn't like the trailer. It was like zac Snyder took my little childhood and stepped on it.
Honestly idk how to feel about the Mickey thing
“sitting at home without your pants on” was wild! I was rolling laughing😂😂😂
Yo Mar Pat sounds so different
next they gon do tinker bell
MOUSE.AVI??!?!??!?!
Is there a Style theory channel?...
Maybe the amazing world of gumball theory?? I still love their take on community service workers and minimum wage jokes and their DHMIS episode
That into was awesome
as someone hoping to eventually publish a take-off of the concept behind _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ and therefore trying to pay a LOT of attention to what is and isn't public domain, i very much appreciate this video :)
The thing that's most angering about comic books characters staying locked in copyright are the lack of reprints. Sure Marvel and DC have reprinted many of the early issues. But most were done in expensive hardbacks. And when it comes to the classic horror/sci-fi related books, good luck. Books like House of Mystery and House of Secrets have never had chronological reprints. If they're not going to do it themselves at least let someone else do it.
How do you even get a copyright and trademark? I need one of those.
bro matpat, you HAVE to do a video on this ARG called welcome home
11:15 The feeling in your throat that makes you slowly morph into Kermit
Agatha Christie hated all the knock-offs of the Sherlock Holmes character so much she wrote a book killing off Hercule Poirot called "Curtain". And no, that's not a spoiler. It was actually advertised as Poirot kicking the bucket. She wanted to make sure his adventures ended with her writing.
So. . .when does Songs of the South enter public domain?😅
Man, you're wrong about red shirt. I have book with oryginal drownings, and Pooh did has the red shirt, but he wears it only during winter. But it's there.
as a creator myself this is actually GREAT info. it means i can have my characters meet A superman, one rooted closer to his origin but free to be adapted. the name already has definition, the “superman” has been defined and certain things cant be changed meaning some things can still be automatically inferred by common knowledge. this is the equivalent of being able to use new melodies in your compositions. go ham creatives!!
I wonder if adult products are protected in the trademarks of any iconic character
1:47 i wonder how you know this information
Why didn’t they just make it an actual bear? Wouldn’t that be scarier?
We dont care about copyright in Costa Rica
The horror film interpretations also probably get a bit of protection via parody and obviously not trying to represent themselves as the original product.
So what about names? Such as Peter Parker as an example. Will it still count as copyright if you use a name of a character but the look background of the character is different.
Where is the last part of FNAF lore on the game theorists channel HUH?!
Five nights at Treasure island with monochromatic mickey gonna be an interesting movie.
I mean if you want to see a horror Superman you already have Brightburn. Sure it isn't exactly superman but everyone could see that's where the idea is from.
I still try to convince myself to this day this movie is just a fever dream and it not real 😂
1:55 LONG LIVE THE KING
Wsp Movie Opinion
1:32 - that's gotta be Sharknado!
Matpat is gonna go to war with the big D
stop trying to make style theory a thing, ittl never work.
Benjamin Franklin never wanted corporations to inifinitely own IP. He originally wanted copyright to end after the death of the creator so current generations could profit from the advancements of the whole. Slowly over time these copyright's kept getting extended to the point where no one except the rich can afford to buy and own and police IP. This is why technology doesn't advance as fast as it could, this is why life saving drugs are being monopolized. Copyright laws are supposed to encourage creation of new IP but in reality it rewards the hoarding of ancient IP.
E.A
the first time I saw this I couldn't beileve it was real lol
If only Aladdin was public Domain. Or Arabian Nights.
Excellent episode!
1:47 (me who actually isn't wearing pants) Okay, Matt, where's the camera?!
I honestly gotta give props to these corporations for how smart they are. They know the ins and outs of the law and make it work in their favor even without breaking it sometimes
You don’t also means there are five furry characters five furry characters that are murdering interesting, very interesting, possible use of an abandoned five nights at Freddy script?
Did not expect his voice to kind of change at 11:34
is it just me or matpats voice changed after 11:18  seems like he used AI
Well given how much these companies are ruining these stories and characters with identity politics I don't imagine they'd be worth defending soon enough.
So, even with public domain, they will look like bootlegs?
?????
How did you know the Northern Pines
jONAThAN MAjors - kang - got arrested for domestic abuse today.  (Disney's real fear)
I'm so happy you learned about referencing trademarks after missing them in previous copyright vids.
Matpat, can Fanfic writers be sued?
i want to watch that movie now
Well matpat the original not the one with the red shirt ( idk if you knew and I’m being stupid or you didn’t want to use or couldn’t find a good image of the original Winnie the Pooh the naked one )
Roblox did it first
Let’s just hope no parents decides to pull a sausage party and take their kids to see these horror movie adaptations because they have the classic characters in them from the Disney movies
Pooh sounds like The Joker.
SCP-001-J: Rumbly in its Tumbly be wildin'...
*gasp* How did you know I didn't have pants on?
Is it just my headphones or is his voice more nasally than usual?
Starting at 11:16 MatPats voice sounds weird. Like an AI recreation or he’s sick or hired a voice double. Idk but it was so striking to me I had to point it out
I'll bet you could use the old golden era Superman logo. The one that looks like comic sans or something. DC doesn't really actively use it anymore.
1:49 I’m actually wearing pjs 😳 but sure and I just thought this was a spoof or joke film I didn’t watch it cause I’m not too interested in these kind of movies 😬
IT IS THE WOOL POOH
"You sitting at home without your pants on" STOP CALLING ME OUT MATTHEW
Mat pat says we don’t wear pants  Me uhhhhhhhhhhh… You (probably) uhhhhhh… Your friends ( probably) also watching so where ( probably) uhhhhhhhh… Everyone else uhhhhhhh… Everyone ( all together now ) UUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHH…
1:48 I literally got out of the shower How did he know…
That explains the new online cartoons that are retro.
2:56 BREAKING BAD REFERENCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
tbh I wouldn’t like it if theyy try make a movie about mickey killing people… that would ruin my childhood
Wait, Sherlock isn't already in public domain? I thought he had been my whole life
Honestly, as an artist, this is all kind of really depressing. Public Domain makes a better friendlier place for creative endeavors, and we're looking at a future that's just going to take that wonderful gift away from newer generations. It's old creators denying newer ones the things they had by default, because they don't want to share. =c
I knew I wasn't the only one who thought the Disney D looked like a G!
Matpat where is my FNAF timeline
When was the last time there was a Disney movie featuring Mickey Mouse?  1950?
My pants are firmly on.
Copyright never should have been extended. 14-20 years is more than enough time to get what you need from a brand. I mean, 70 years after the author’s death is crazy, right? We’re all in agreement with that?
Disney keeps pushing the public domain laws back because they own politics, and Winnie the Pooh was only ever licensed to them, outside their spin on the character. It's funny how a lot of Kingdom Hearts fans instinctively know this lol
So. On one side, style theory, we're arguing how important these things are. On Film theory we're arguing how much these need to be revoked because otherwise the intent of things are hamstrung. There is no good answer here. Good luck.
Mat pat the fnaf video
They said it was a myth, now its real
Dude, I literally have no pants on....I feel called out.
NOT YOU CALLING ME OUT ON "WITHOUT YOUR PANTS ON" AS I'M IN BED WITHOUT MY PANTS ON 🙃🙃🙃
Souper man
Nah Disney's worst nightmare is making an understandable kingdom hearts game
Hi - trade mark examiner in australia. I know America has a slightly different system to us, but for anyone going for a trade mark - hyphens will not help you. We look for “substantially identical” or “deceptively similar”. Hyphens would still keep something deceptively similar. The specificity as well as some evidence probably got them over the line, but I’d be surprised if it got through first time.
You should make a video on MR Moon from sing… he should be in jail-
Hey matpat have you heard of the stagtown ARG?
I'm one step ahead of you matpat I put my pants on before watching the video! Better luck next time.
Not me sitting at home without pants on feeling called out…
yes
your   the   best
Mickey was supposed to enter the public domain 3 times, but each time it was about to, mysteriously, the length of copyright holding extended just before it happened... or so the legend goes. but now they dont need to... as much of a joke as it is to say that nothing original exists, soon it'll be even truer, as everything will be trademarked to such an extent that any attempts at anything new will just inadvertently draw comparisons to something trademarked and get crushed as a result...
ummmmmmmmmm  im   subscribed
I’ve never even heard of this movie or the trailer
I haven't even seen the movie yet and I'm already so excited for sequel. 😅😅😅
Disney’s greatest nightmare is a Jewish Disney princess 😆😆😆 #iykyk
Mf you just called me out, I was sitting on the dunny when you said "yeah you at home with no pants on"
offically launching GREAT man. He's the one that does his own laundry. Never asks for money. Cannot leap a building but something that is just slightly higher than average.
Stop the hate
If there was a Mickey Mouse horror film THERE BETTER BE A BENDY CAMIO SOME WARE
Ive always find Pooh creepy as a kid
Lmao feel like 4:40 was a subtle diss at the Finebros React series 😂
This reminds me of the Simpson episode about the original creator of itchy & scratchy being ripped off by big cooperation
"you, without your pants on" It's definitely not your business what i do in my own home xD
I think I’ve watched too much theories, I only speak Mat Pat. I wonder if what you watch affects your behavior. Dang it! There’s the Mat Pat speaking.
HoW dose he know I don't have pants on?😮😮😮😮
Is this why they made the designs for Mickey and his friends in "The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse"? Did they re-redesign those characters as an attempt to further protect the copyright for the old designs?
I loved the guy who did the second voice at the beginning of the video!!
this isnt even a theory. more like facts.
13:45 I know this is a half serious joke but this is exactly my dream! But I have for quite a while built up a plan of stuff inspired by the book instead.
Even if those characters leave the copyright of their creators, people would still know who they really came from
We complain about wanting new horror material and here is what we got
Actually, Disney's worst nightmare is dreamwork's succes.
Looking forward to the Peter Pan movie
Do a loud house theory
i took off my pants to poop and he mentioned i didn’t have pants i’m scared
I just noticed that winnie the pooh looks like friendo in the life of luxury video
Do you know about Murder Drones? If not I do recommend watching it. I’ve got a bit a theory going about what the acid that the murder drones use in their tails and well, I can only do so much. I was wondering if you could make a theory about what the acid in murder drones is so we can get more theories on it and well just get an idea of what it is.
I can't wait for "Winnie the Pooh takes over the Chinese Communist Party and runs the country into the ground"
16:09 bro got the real copyright magazine **OMG SO REAL** **SURPRISING**
I watched this last night... The acting was so shocking from the "girls/victims"
aa much as we believe that a big corporation is untouchable... im gonna guess that disney will lose this one... im just imagining disney going to court because someone made a steamboat Willie cartoon, and when the judge looks at the case they will stare at disney and say "did you really think you can skirt the law by claiming the work of art that was copyrighted is now trademarked?" If they are doing like matt pat theorized, they are gonna lose hard
Can you make a Emesis blue theory
Mat pat are series made by YouTubers almost all the time are bad ?
Peter pans one I would actually want to watch
The Pooh from the Slasher flick is not Disney Pooh, it is Pooh from the A.A. Miline books.
The solution is to tear it all down. Break all these laws. Just destroy everything.
Make a book about Superman but make it have no pictures and then on the title have it blank but add t he colors. So then the title should have all letters spaced out so it would be called                      S U P E R M A N. There ya go.
omg i thought you had Patrick Warburton in the intro 🥰
Love the intro, good Mickey impression!
I'm very scared.
Hey... What happened to the final chapter of the FNAF timeline? I went to your game theory channel and it's not there. Explain yourself matpat, if that's even your real name! You said March 25th and March 25th....is....TODAY! 🤔😠😡😤
HEHE YELLOW BEAR
You know Paddington isn't an original I.P. right?
1:48 You’re right, I don’t have pants because I’m taking a bath
I vote for Supperman as an acceptable spin off name. His super power is to make dinner perfectly.
Please do theory on crativeboi
"the times they are' changin"->matpats seemingly unintentional pirates of the Caribbean quote XD
Where can I watch this
4:47 Fine Bros React
Nah this movie was amazing what are yall talking about
I honestly didnt think this movie wasn't that bad 🤷‍♂️
Does anyone know where I can watch it
Question can you do a bluey theory
do a therory on Murder Drones
I'm fine with this but if someone uses Mickey in a bad way I will hunt them down
For steamboat Mickie the tone of the wisle could be played in a low pitch instead of a high pitch
In the intro why does it sound like joe from family guy dressed up as Pooh bear?
I was kinda hoping this was a review so I would know if it was worth watching lol
Do a coraline theory please
Winnie the Pooh is in the public domain
I couldn’t stop laughing when you said let’s get some honey and a machete I immediately thought of one of my friends Bass because he always slashed his mum’s plants 😅with his little machete!
How’d he know I didn’t have my pants on
I remember the REACT controversy back in the days.
It was scary when you said “you, yes you alone in your house without your pants on” This is only true because of autoplay whilst taking a shower
1:48 was uncalled for
So if superman hasn't entered the public domain yet, what about Brightburn?  It follows all the rules of not using trademarks but is clearly DC with all their current powers.
Here comes Winnie, You're gonna Pooh your pants!
If Disney doesn't want characters to become Public Domain under the Copyright Laws they spent decades to change, they should make new content with those characters instead of chasin' the dragon's bank account.
1:47 🤨…. Imma make a film theory on how Matpat knew i was relaxing with my pants off
I hate that they made Winnie the pooh a horror film. I normally love scary stuff, but know its practicly ruining my best memories of my parents, which was when they read stuff like Winnie the pooh to me. They are not dead, I just have no clue where they are. Now anytime I think of those times, I think of murder. Leading me into thinking of how we will all die eventually.
None of the mega corps will allow cash cows to become public domain.  And the public domain isn’t a magic solution to corpratized garbage.    Many pre superman “super hero” characters are public domain, yet nobody’s making bank off of these “beloved classic  characters”.  The key to making good content out of these IPs is putting people that care about them in charge of them.
He says “Yes you sitting at home with out you pants on” while I’m about to get in the shower
Jokes on you, I'm not home!
I know this is completely random to say, but I'm so glad that when mat pay mentioned how different countries have different systems for copyrighting that one of the 3 countries he featured on screen was Australia  An oddly nice thing to see since I don't really see many people featuring the country where I live  It's nice to see Australia being recognised for once ^^
These will be cult classic films exactly like the Sharknado franchise
what’s up with these videos recently. in a lot of videos matpats’ voice feels off after halfway through
0:24 Who knew Mickey Mouse could pill off a Patrick Warburton impression?
That was a polite way of saying that half the country hates Disney because it's objectively bad. And that's before you add in the wierd sexuallized preteen dramas they've been slinging for the last 2 decades.
Hmm... maybe a Superman movie titled Man from Krypton... is that allowed? Is the word Krypton trademarked?
Yeaaah. I roll my eyes at people going 'reee capitalism evil',  but even I will instantly and enthusastically agree that Corporation ARE in fact evil and should be ripped apart (legally speaking). Corporations are parasites, the only real question is what role are they fulfilling that allows them to exist and how can we satisfy that need in a way that will make corporations redundant and obsolute.
POV me:  What can i watch oh wait didn’t matt pat say the 25
YouTube didn't stroke out the video was on the recommended video list (came over from style theory)🤣👍
My pants are on they're just inside out.
Film theory videos are so boring now
2:48 South Park clip that I liked how you used
I feel like the Peter Pan ones already been done.
trademarks only apply to similar industries most of the time. meaning you can still use trade mark colors as long as it isn't for the same industry
@Mat - D&D should have the rights to use “Hobbits” as a halfling because wizards of the coast have a new LOTR set of magic the gathering cards coming out
It sure would be a shame if all these megacorps were broken up.
where part 4 of the fnaf time line
Matpat, heres a theory for you, how/why has disney not been broken down into smaller companies, they seem to own like 80% of the media in the US.
1:47 f##k you......
#notmypooh
But.... Brightburn was a horror remake of Superman MatPat, so you are a little late to that portion 😂
Let’s not forget a Superman horror movie has already came out
Matpat should do an episode on mr freeman
4:55 Talking about how you don’t own the idea of a theory channel, as a youtuber, makes me wonder if this is an old school “shots fired” at the Fine Bros when they tried to claim ownership over the react format and the backlash from how ridiculous that was basically killed their channel.
Hey why not.  One comic company already made a DEADPOOH (Deadpool parody) series that uses ALL the characters from the cartoon and has YET to be Sued by Disney or Marvel.
I wonder how creative people will be once those characters enter the public domain, so many hurdles to jump through but hey, I'm not too knowledgeable on the topic but from what I hear when vine came out and had those small videos a lot of people got really creative with the time they were given and now short videos are really popular and tik tok is big because of that, so hopefully we can get creative with what little stuff we get
Someone is 100% going to make a horror movie based on all of the Disney characters 😂
Are you watching me through my screen? How did you know I had no pants on?!?!
Just make horror films, no one would believe disney made it.
Brightburn did it pretty well.. 🤔🤔
“A lotta free time on our hands” I beg to differ
how did you know
Actually a good idea..hopefully the movies get better lol
If I recall correctly my favorite series Ace Attorney was only recently able to bring the One with Sherlock Holmes as a side character to the U.S. because of similar loopholes i.e. he was called Herlock Instead right? I may have a fact or two wrong but thought I'd ask.
Mickey can't be done In horror movie style. The copyright and trademarks would already be protected thanks to the beta artwork for the win game.
I have no interest in seeing the Slasher Pooh movie but I'm glad it gets to exist. Hopefully we'll see more done with things becoming public domain
Batman goes public in 2034
I HATE to imagine a Mickey Mouse horror movie
where is the fnaf theory
HOW DO YOU KNOW
If Disney had their way they could sue us every time we say the name "Disney". With what Disney has done to my favorite 2 childhood content creating companies,  Marvel and Star wars, I would love to see them crumble. They have made me dispise that which I once loved
I want more movies like Winnie - the - Pooh xD i can't wait for it to happen
personally, i'd like to see copyright taken back to the first copyright act's length: 14 years with an option to extend another 14, if your work is over 14 years old but under 28 you get it instantly grandfathered in, if it's over 28 it's public domain.  and you can't trademark video, and your trademark must be something distinct from your copyrighted work, so the superman S would not be but the DC logo would be, for example.
speaking of trademarks and copy rights matpatt check out willys wonderland! i would love too see your theory on it!
6:59 MEET THE PYRO
My god...I can't even imagine this movie being one of those "So bad it's good" type of movies like some of those direct to DVD/TV sci-fi movies. Pooh as a horror movie is just wrong. Someone who made the movie had childhoods that went horribly wrong. And they gave this thing a SEQUEL?  My hopes for humanity just sank further. Just when I thought said hopes had finally hit the basement, they break through to a new level. Wow.
Wait what? What do you mean, my pants are on.
Petition to make a film theory about dreamworks “Ariel”
They are doing a similar thing with the grinch and even though it’s not Disney they are turning it into a horror movie. Although I don’t think they call him the grinch I think they call him the mean one.
Im here before watching, i guess it will be about Micky Mouse going to public 2:42 Yes, it looks like it
I can't find where to watch the movie does anyone know where I can see it.
So.... this isn't a real theory about the movie.. WHY BOTHER?
Petition to have Dan be the voice of Winnie the Pooh
so we can make a remake of the Mickey and Minnie s** tape that Walt burned and have it be official at some point in the future
How u know I didn’t have pants on…
Okay but i here for Peter Pan he is a creep in my opinion
This shi is hideous imagine they doing this wit frozen💀
I saw the movie. It was as entertaining as the cocaine bear. the movie honestly wasn't bad.
Pin this comment if your video was educational.
Fanfication is going to have so much fun with "What's canon".
That is this but that's for kids
disneys worst fear is...           spending money
bambi definitely deserves a reckoning.  but i really want peter pans neverland nightmare.  i liked the idea of the grinch horror movie and like david howard thornton but i dont think it was done well at all.
Imagine being first
All fun and games till public domain comes up
So MatPat. Question; can I use steam boat willie, and draw him with out his hat, and call him steam-boat willie legally? I got rid of his little hat to change his appearance and I changed his name to add dashed to steam-boat.
why would someone do this to pooh
I don't know if this is a video idea but the other day my sister asked me if the Disney princesses had a battle royals between each other who would win. It was either with accessories ( like princess jasmine using genie) and without just hand to hand combat. She said princess jasmine cause with her 3 wishes and mulan because she was trained to do hand to hand combat. But I wonder if we missed a princess that could be better like the princess from brave. (Yes I forgot her name lol)
This video just provides one example of why the laws around Copyrights, Trademarks, and Patents REALLY need to be altered or given some level of rollback
Never underestimate the greed and assholery of corporations. They have no fucks to give about anything but making money. And if that means gutting the public domain, so be it!
Disney when all the characters are in the public domain: NOOOOOOOOOOO PLS DONT STEAL
"You sitting at home without your pants on."  I feel seen...
Not me taking a dump when MatPat 1:48
MATPAT U GOTTA LOOK INTO FREAK BAIT I THINK THERES LOREEEEEEE
11:15 matpats sounding like Kermit the frog here
Bro where is fnaf ultimate timeline final part
1:57 didn't have to call me out like that
1:50, alright, I’m not wearing pants, I’m wearing a dress
Wait did Kronk just kidnapped MatPat?!!!
Oh hey did Footofaferret voice Pooh in the start?
Hey Matt Pat, did you see that new mansion merge commercial with Pedro Pascal, you need to see it
Copyright law was created to provide an incentive to authors, artists and scientists to create original works.  Extending it to 120 years has had the opposite effect.  If you have no money or power you'll be smothered and your work will be stolen.  Stolen as in they'll take it, copyright it and if you protest they'll slapp you.
Ok, we NEED a stop motion animated adaptation of the original Winnie the pooh
Personally i don't want any of these characters going into the public domain I mean at all I don't wanna see someone make a super man horror story honestly wished Copy right last forever like trade marks
How can WB have a copyright over the nemesis system for Shadow of War?
I have control your àç97ñ5
Why does poah sound like Joe Swanson in the opening skit
Does anyone know if the other characters seen in Steamboat Willie will be in the public domain?
I hate greed so much...
Why is my country angry? aZZiE 3:50
bright burn did an awesome job making a clark movie
I hope no one's take-away here is that copyright is bad. It's the only protection any creator has that large companies won't just take your work and milk all the money they can out of it.
NOOOOOOOOOOOO! My childhood😂
How did he know im not wearing pants!?!?
1:47 I feel attacked
Both copyrights and trademarks have big aspects that Matpat neglected here. For copyright, there's the aspect of "mise-en-scene" (which is similar but not quite the same as the theatre meaning). Basically, only aspects of a work that are sufficiently "expressive" and "original" can be copyrighted, so if something is too mundane or expected, it's not included. This could mean that Superman's other abilities count as long as they're the ones that superheroes tend to have (like flight). There's also the part where new versions of Superman would still get to own new elements that are themselves original (like if you decided that Superman now gets to revive the dead or something).  For trademarks, there's both the issue of trademark erosion (when a trademark becomes the generic form for something and thus unable to be a trademark) and whether the use is relevant to the actual purpose of the trademark to begin with. I suspect the steamboat willy frames won't actually infringe unless used in thumbnails, since they don't actually work to identify a source if they're in the middle of an animation.
thanks for making me crave superman ice cream mattpat the constant word superman being said immidiately made my brain think of the ice cream lol
I AM WEARING PANTS
13:00 what is I flip them upside down
Didn't expect Winnie to sound like kusko, almost spat out my drink
Is it just me or did matpat's voice just change half way through the vid then change back? For a moment I thought it was one of the researchers chiming in.
What...No Kiss and Forget super power?
matpat sounds eepy in this vid 😴😴💤 a mimir
Oh, my goodness…  If I can…I’ll certainly make the most copyright/trademark-neutral offbrand versions of ALL of these guys to hide as Easter eggs in my otherwise original stuff!!! (And I’m probably gonna have some…somewhat cynical/not-too-cynical fun with those guys too!!!) (Example for a redesigned Mickey would be moving his ears a little lower to the sides of his head, maybe give him your own design, and swap some colors around? But again, I’m just a guy online, and am NOT a lawyer or anything like that! This is just my brain going wild!)
Ya know, as much as Disney can be a scumbag, I'm glad they're trying their best to protect Mickey Mouse and that because this Winne The Pooh horror movie is an absolute joke.
All of this didn’t factor in one thing: AI. With the recent exponential pace of growth in AI and the availability of tools like midjourney and stable diffusion, the entire dynamic of copyright for fictional works will change, since now anybody can publish a book with images using data from copyrighted works. I was kinda disappointed MatPat didn’t cover this.
I have a question, the silhouetted Micky mouse we often see you know the basic 3 circles Mickey Lego. Is that trademarked. If so could u argue that any media using the so called hidden Mickey idea is intact incorporating trademarks into their media or am I thinking too deep
You are in debt Matpat, you owe us the final fnaf timeline
Makes joke: no one cares. Someone else says same thing: wow! Me: copyright
1:29 BLAHAJ SPOTTED
3:29   hnmmmmm what a familiar arm and at 4:33
"Yes, you sitting without pants on, literally you." Me: "H- how did you know!?"
Help! I don't have la lot of time it's antiscepticeye
That "Got milk" superman poster looks suspiciously like Matpat...
How did you know I have no pant on?
12:47 Fun fact: There is actually a DC character named Super-Man with a hyphen. His real name is Kenan Kong and he comes from China.
Here 7h ago
day 1 of asking for matpat to make a video on the 3 presidents playing mc
BRO THIS MOVIE WAS LITERALLY THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN IT'S SO BAD
Fun fact Matpat, I'm not at home with my pants off. I'm slacking at work😂.
isn't tm limited to it being used for branding/promotion/advertising though?
Can you make a Game theory of "Changed" Lore ist scatterd all over the place
Matpat i beat your system I AM WEARING PANTS
How is the thumbnail for this video scary than the movie it’s about
This is something that actually comes up in NASCAR of all things.  The individual shops can apply for the car numbers from the NASCAR office. And while NASCAR has allows reassigned the same number to the shop that used it last year, they can assign it to someone else. Particularly, a shop might drop a number if they want to change it for a new driver (shops can only have a max of 4 numbers). Or if a shop failed to use a number they were assigned, NASCAR is likely to give it to someone else (with notable exceptions like #3 which remained assigned to Childress Racing fir years following the death of Earnhardt).  But, shop are able to trademark a stylized version of the number. So, when Dale Jr left DEI for Hendrick, Hendrick applied for 88 since DEI was still holding on to 8. But even though Hendrick got the double 8, they couldn't just use the 8 as it appeared on his old car, it had to look different. And that would have been the same even if DEI had let Hendrick have the 8.  Even in NASCAR, trademark protects enough to make it impossible to copy something as simple as a number
Why does matpat sound like Kermit when explaining trademarks hahahaha
Can’t wait for the South Park episode about Mickey Mouse entering the public domain that’s gonna be awesome talk about catharsis
Just use souper man and people should get it. Put a bowl of chowder as his signature with steam.
How did he know I was pantless……
10:16 anyone except South Park
That thumbnail just brought back a nightmare I had as a little kid. And Dora turned her head around 180° like an owl.
Please reduce the padding on your episodes.. I felt like every other line was filler. I get you have a brand but come on..
At least Peter pan makes the most sense he already pulls out knives before horror touched it
How come at the start of the video Pooh sounds like Patrick warburton
So, I have an question, does godzilla roar count as a trademark?
You think the heat vision and flight alone makes him super? dude... He's still basically the Hulk, just less identity issues and more clothes. Remember that opening fight between Baldur and Kratos... Superman would fight like Baldur. I'd watch that movie. That's his year 1 style. Just less savage in desperation.
WE NEED BOOK THEORY MATT PAT PLS GIVE IT TO US
The ultimate troll, someone who navigates all the legal loopholes to make a steam boat willie esk character that goes around stealing peoples art and putting trade marks on it
Mmmm nothing tastes like Crony Capitalism. The unique blend of stale ideas and never ending  corporate domination is just impressive.
When you said "Yes you sitting at home without your pants on" I was in the bathroom
1:46 how did he know. How did he know I don’t wear pants while in my bed. How Mathew Patrick , how
Matpat could actually open a fifth channel: copyright theory
Well, I don't think the current Pooh design is in the public domain.
Did matpat change voice acters 😂 @11:15
I'd pay money to see a full film of this 0:00
1:47 bro i just got home after a night out tired as fudge, clothes felt heavy, sitting down to watch a YouTube video and i literally got no pants on, i feel targeted.
4:00 please, someone boring enough to make that video (i though that were you MatPat)
This early into the episode, I'm going to make a leap of faith and guess that Lawrence Lessig gets mentioned at some point. If so, it's about time MatPat covered this. I guess that holds true even if I'm wrong, not nearly enough people in the public eye have talked much about current US IP law and the chilling effect it's (intended to have) had on creativity
Disney is the fucking Empire and we are the Ewoks, no wonder they wanted to own Star Wars
They also made a horror movie for The Grinch too.
Hey loved your video and the analysis. I just think your perspective as to what might come, when these characters enter public domain is quite dark. We habe already seen, that public domain characters and storys can be used in creative and unique ways. I am thinking about the Enola Holmes movies/books or the Athena-Club novels, just to name to examples. Sure this may not be for everyone, but they show that there is potential. Filling blanks authors left in there work, taking side characters and giving them a bigger role or shining a spotlight on forgotten characters/places, while mixing with unique characters and ideas. I believe that the future is bright and creative people will write fantastic storys😊
I hate this.  I love Pooh and this movie is not something I want to see. Now I'll watch the video,
Winnie the Pooh is the nick name of Xi Jinping  president of china 🤣 the name was given by citizens of China they believe Xi Jinping looks like Winnie the Pooh 😂 Just Google it I did lol.
When he said "yes you sitting at home without your pants on", how does he know? lol
Oh No The Disney Matt Mouse Is Back 0x0
Superman already has a horror movie called bright burn
2:36 no wonder the Hong Kong Disneyland is changing their botanic icon from Miky to Duffy😅
1:48 how TF do you know!?!?!?
What your talking about his a leader if a communist country
Anybody else want him to make a lego monkie kid theory? No just me ok…
Ahh yes nugget sees matpat has uploaded a new theory video
Hey Matt! Hopefully you see this but I saw you the other day at Disney world! Sorry to say but I was the security guy that sent you and others to the table I’m sorry😭
Kind of a 1000 IQ move by Disney
Where’s fnaf
yeah this is cool and all but what's scarier is how matpat knew I was sitting at home without my pants on...
I can see a world where there are low budget Smallville-esque drama series on places like youtube leaning INCREDIBLY dark.
My original theory on this was wrong.   Here is the new one based on yours, the copyright law has expired at a time when a lot of people want to watch the world burn.  That is grim. 😢
Why when matpat said it belongs you yeah you sitting at home with no pants on I was putting different clothes on?😂
Time for more passionate, deserving, ravenous and creative people to get liberty in making Mouse content.  Even though I think it's like 20 years late because money and BS.
"...without your pants on "  yoo doesn't need to get personal, my guy
Wasn’t that Peter Pan series with Louis Partridge kinda like this?
Gotta pay tribute to the mouse
Mickey mouse horror movies gonna be wiiiild.  Although a scarface remake with only scsrface being swapped for mickey mouse line for line would be....entertaining.
Moist and pat?
Wow
Thanks for this video❤
CCP ?
how did you know i dont have pants on?         let me clears this before you call me weird im wearing a oversized hoodie with very tight shorts
Isnt “Bright Burn” the b listed  Superman horror movie?
do the middle button as a channel
Tigger is safe for now, as for Pooh, Piglet, Eyor, Rabbit and Owl, I'm sorry.
How many times have I heard Mat explain copyright law on this channel now?? *_too many times._* XD Trademark law is a new one though, I can't think of a time off the top of my hrad hes talked about the difference.
Where is the final part of the fnaf timeline
Why did Matt patt have to call me out for not having pants on
from poohs diet to **law of use of an fictional bear**      i love this channel
I wonder how much these live-action remakes nobody asked for play into this concept 🤔
Not the first time I’ve seen this but not horror just DreamWorks being DreamWorks kind of things
usually all this legal jargon doesn't hold my attention but wow, i didn't realize copyright and trademark laws were so blooming specific. thanks for presenting it all in an interesting way, matpat. i have a feeling this video is going to be pretty handy for a lot of people over the next few years.
Plz do a vid about baby in yelliw again theres even more
And I’m only 10 lol
Well this is creepy
Baby in yellow
Just going to leave this here in case people want an informed look at copyright and public domain, and why things entering the public domain isn't quite as good as you might think. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV1DxpXllC8
I think my teacher was scared about being trademarked because he said we wouldn't be playing octopus but toxic calamari in gym
1:48 HOW DOES HE KNOW
"Yes, you sitting at home without any pants on."  He just knows his audience too well
17:57 Oh boy you just pissed of an entire country!   Paddington Bear has been around since 1958 and is in no way a Pooh rip off.   Apart from being friendly talking bears they have nothing in common   Putting him with Bendy and Homelander is quite frankly kinda offensive.   We have statues of that bear for Christ sake!
Honestly I just want nintendo to stop taking down fan-games
When I first heard "Whopper, Whopper," I was not sure what to expect. But as the lyrics flowed through my ears, I felt that in my soul, this was a song that spoke to my deepest desires. The catchy tune and repetitive lyrics had me humming the tune long after the song had ended.  The line "Junior, Double, Triple Whopper" reminded me of the thrill of having options, and the excitement of choosing the perfect meal. The songwriters perfectly captured the flame-grilled taste of a Whopper, with the addition of perfect toppers that add a touch of perfection to every bite.  The chorus of "I rule this day" is powerful and empowering, reminding us to take control of our lives and seize the moment. It's a sentiment that I felt deeply, and it resonated with me on a personal level.  The bridge of the song, with its reference to lettuce, mayo, pickle, and ketchup, had me reminiscing about the many times I've customized my Whopper to my liking. It's okay if I don't want that, because the beauty of the Whopper is that it can be made to suit any taste.  The lyrics of "Whopper, Whopper" had me emotionally invested, and I cried at the part where they mentioned the Impossible or bacon Whopper. It was a poignant moment that reminded me of the many times I've had to choose between two amazing options.  "Whopper, Whopper" is a song that speaks to the heart and soul of anyone who has ever enjoyed a Whopper. It's a celebration of choice, customization, and the joy of having things our way. I highly recommend this song to anyone who loves a good burger and a great tune.
Disney might try that, but I have to wonder how courts feel about Trademarks being used to circumvent copyrights. I also wonder what would happen if we started charging for trademarks and copyrights based on the age of the work.
What's up with the voiceover change halfway through the video?
Thank you for the Kingdom Hearts reference, that made me happy
1:29 I couldnt find the another video on why they exist thing. anyone care to help me?
When he said “you sitting at home without your pants on” I actually wasn’t wearing pants
So basically, Disney and all the companies like em are on their villain timing again, go freaking figure.
I saw this movie in the cinema, it was pretty bad done with Winnie the Pooh, HOWEVER the gore was AMAZING, like extremely graphic even for a slasher. It was pretty interesting how uneven it was
I myself have this theory that Disney might try to put forward a "corporations as people" act and then give all their rights to the Disney Corporation. As an entity, a corporation is technically alive and can't really die. Which means as long as the corporation owns the right to a copyright, it will never fall into the public domain. BUT HEY, THAT'S JUST A THEORY; A FILM THEORY!!!
1:48 how did he know?
11:16   Is it just me, or did matpat start sounding like Kermit 😮
Waiting for fnaf timeline
Well technically we already got the Superman horror look up brightburn it's a literally just Superman as a kid but evil Same powers in origin. They just changed the name and design the end credits even have a scene alluding to evil, Aquaman and Wonder woman
i have a question can the next episode be about pj masks it is about 3 kids fighting villains at night
1:48 I’m watching this naked
How did you know that I have no pants on lol
Why didn't the voice glitch when he said the other channels?
Actually, what's even scarier is that there are people whose minds are warped & diseased enough to even conceive of such dreck.  (And even scarier is that they get paid for it.)  In saner times, such individuals would've been placed in institutions for the incurably-insane.  Now they're given big budgets & told to go make movies.  Progress?
11:15 matpat morphed into kermit for a moment to explain trademarks?!
O_h_i_o
imagen companies having to come up with new ideas because they can't just skate on the same thing for all of time.
You know the worst and most ironic part about Disney's involvement with the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998? And just about everything about copyrights and trademarks related to them?  Just look at their entire film catalog, especially pre-2000. The vast majority of their original movies, specifically animated, were based on or use characters/stories IN the public domain.
Am I the only one who remembers this releasing like 2-3 months ago?
I did know most of these. I've got a friend who's been running himself hoarse over the whole copyright and trademark stuff. So I was aware of most of this stuff. Even learning some for myself like the fact Zorro is in the public domain but that he is part of a trademark as well as a company that claims to still hold the copyright (not sure how that one works but hey)  also was it just me or did Mat's voice completely change at several points when talking about Trademark? It didn't sound like he was sick or had to do another take, it almost sounded like a different person.
This guy seems into legal battles these days
"yes you sitting at home without pants on" as I was taking off my pants...dont do this to me...
The Further Adventures of Soup R. Mann
Screw these garbage horror movies lol
11:17 that audio caught me off guard
Actually matpat i am not at home without my pants, i am at a symphonic performance.
How dare you im waring pants
0:22 I….I did not think that was his hand rising up at first😳
Can you do an episode on how Mr. Poe is obviously working with Count Olaf in the Netflix series A Series Of Unfortunate Events?
Mouse. Avi movie?
tbhh theres a tgame in roblox of that
The thing that stinks...is if Shien ever shut down due to the press. They'd reopen under a new name and just do it all again.
The major railroads do this with Trademarks as well. so many small rr's have merged they have to run the logos (on special painted railcars or locomotives) of all the railroads to keep ownership of the logos of the old rr's that don't technically exist anymore.
When i saw the title me and my friends were laughing so much
I loved pooh when I was little disney has ruined me
Hmm i have a question does the copyright work on the internet characters like trollface
Is it just me or is YouTube recommending game theory less ???
it makes me sick that corporations, beyond just Disney, are now basically monolith monopolies. One good thing about public domain is that it allows for inspired and innovative iterations of idea's to be released. Copyright is supposed to allow the original person to gain profit from their ideas before others can jump on the band wagon.  This issue of trademarks and copyrights being used to control markets goes beyond entertainment. Soybeans- farmers can get sued for shelling their own beans to replant next season if to near another farmer who purchased soybeans from Monsanto (there was a case of this a few years back); Pharmaceutical companies that come up with new medication- it takes a while before off brands can produce anything and help bring the cost down (although I think this industry has different laws).  It's disgusting and hurts the public and options for new talent or idea's to come to the board. I don't care for current movies- because it is a lot of the same thing by few production companies taking the 'safe' route. 28 years seems like plenty of time for a copyright- not a lifetime +70 years or 120 years. If I had the money, I would love to take a lawsuit to the higher courts to get the laws reassessed.  I can't stress enough how gross and disgusted I feel.
Me looking down with my pants on, realizing this disqualifies me from owning Winnie the Pooh: "This is bullshit!"
Not gonna lie, I would love to see if an Indie studio was able to make a fascinating reimagining of Batman, based purely on his golden age incarnation.   That is the hero we probably don’t deserve or need but when I would definitely like to see.  (Also I’m pretty sure they would have to call it something like “The Gothic Adventures of the Mysterious Bat-Man” or something like that if they want to sneak around trademark.$
What about FNAF
Did matpat just tell us he's making a 5th channel one day?!?!?!
Try murder drones
I saw the trailer fir this like a year ago and thought it was the worst thong I've seen until I saw a few months later "Bear on Crack"😑
I’m excited for that horror movie
I have  a idea for something it's called the suitmation trails and it's on YouTube
A Disney horror universe? So they want to create some sort of... Killthem Hearts?
Okay, for the Superman stuff, what I mainly wanna know is when Krypton and/or Kryptonian enters the public domain.  Anything else I can just dance around with my media-hopping character, either called by one of her canon names, Shin no Kuishinbo or Captain Ellie Effeson, or the generic name from the trope I originally designed her for, Gluttony.  Basically it's a what if scenario in which one of the embodiments of the 7 Deadly Vices decides they wanna be a superhero and, upon realizing it just won't be possible in her own media, decides to invade other hero oriented story settings.  For one of her adventures, she becomes a Kryptonian, or if that word isn't public domain yet at the time, but Krypton is, then she "acquires a new body whose genetic origins lie on Krypton," and begins calling herself Super Kuishinbo or Super Ellie.
1:46 HOW DID HE KNOW I DIDN'T HAVE PANTS ON!?!?! That Honestly took me by surprise 😅😅
9/10 Homelanders recommend this theory
Every time i remember the powers of the first incarnation of superman, i remember of that character from samurai jack that teaches Jack to not fly but jump very good
brightburn is more a horror version of superman than homelander
My dear MatPat, if Disney rolls into DC splashing that cash, Twitter Facebook and every media corporation will zip it.
The real knockoff Winnie the Pooh is Xi Jinping.
disney, alignment - Lawful Evil
These theories are spectacular 😂
Next channel: Law Theory?
I've never watched a single video on this channel. I specifically said I don't want to get any recommendations from it and I still keep getting so fucking much. YouTube favouritism is on another level.
Call it uber-mench and film it in Germany
Glad to see this small channel finally is getting some recognition
Reminded me of Phantom of the Opera, where everyone is writing their own Phantom story, but taking place after the story is said is done or changing part of the ending for our own amusement. Including a different version of Phantom of the Opera or beginning origin story.
Dammit, why can't we have a Katee Robert cinematic universe; instead of bad horror movie disney ripoffs, its good kinky mobster Disney rip-offs (something I never thought I'd say)?!
"Yes you, sitting at home without your pants on." Me: HOW?! HOW DOES HE KNOW EVERYTHING?!
Superman has so many clones that is maybe better to just create another clone. Unless you have a really good idea.
there's gonna be a grinch horror movie
7:22 didn't I do it for you
Hold on a minute... Could the new crappy disney remakes be related to this? Sure, they're easy money, but they also add new (copyrighted) things to the characters. That way people will always be using the 'old version'
These would all be much better off as animated rather than live action
Quick question, what's the song called because it is certainly a banger
Mickey spear fishing for Ariel on his boat

I would love a live action superman movie with only his original powers.
Disney  worst nightmare is that the hundreds of millions of artist on the internet is going to take a crack at 1928 Micky and that a few  of them is going to find a spin on the character that is going to evolve in to a series that they can not monotheist or worse control. My takeaway from the video is that copyright are broad and fleeting, while trademarks are eternal and absurdly specific. Have Disney's lawyers truly thought of every angel?
There’s a pizza place in Kalamazoo Michigan called “Bilbo’s Pizza” and their menu items all have  Lord of the Rings  themed names.
Omg it's released finally i can't believe i missed the release
Expect Disney to just extend the law by bri... I mean, donating to both parties
Dude, sounds like Kermit 11:16
So what happens when the various Mickey Mouse cartoons where his designed was revised enters the public domain? Will Disney just make sure they continue having separate trademarks for all the different incarnations?
I might be crazy but matpat started to sound weird at times did they use an ai to finish his lines?
Matt you need to look up the new ad of lily garden cause they just release it
Matpat I in comics Thanos is in love with death and Heala is the goddess of death?
Love these videos but this one has to be the most half-a$$ed researched one yet. I could do a whole video showing all the factual inaccuracies of this video, mostly around trademarks.  But still, entertaining... :)
I saw this movie in theaters and I hated every second of it. I regret everything
just wait, I'm gonna make souperman and his logo will be a soup bowl.
We're in a time where the government is social media
Actually it is steamboat Willy that is going to the public domain
“We don’t own theory videos as a whole” *cough* Fine Bros trying to copyright the react genre *cough*
While I don’t like this for Disney, for things like Lord of the Rings, I hope the Estate has sufficient official trademarks so ripoff books/“sequels” don’t get legally allowed beyond fanfic (I.e. not being sold as real books)
5 bucks says Peter Pan is  going to be a Michael Jackson’s character
2 fast 2 poohurious
How to bypass copyright (and especially trademark) laws: Step 1: Move to another country with less strict copyright/trademark laws Step 2: Make whatever you want Step 3: Release your content only in that country and countries with similar less strict laws, but especially not the US, and they won't be able to do much about it
The r34 artists are getting ready
I NEED THE LAST PART TO THE FNAF TIMELINE PLEAAAASSSSSEEEE
I love WTP but turning him and his friends into a horror movie ruins the og premise of the story.
1:48 “Yes you sitting at home with your pants off”  Me sitting on the toilet:  👁️👄👁️
this studio has made other horror fairy tales before, nothing new
this was the worst movie ive ever watched and theres a film theory on it 😨
The DMCA is the ONLY thing protecting it.
Haha wow of course they did that >< ha well I guess it makes sense in a way
Will all the theorys creat one?
Really makes me wonder how all those Mickey, Mario, & Sonic FNF mods tie into this
I LOVE COPYRIGHT! It is interesting. also I would rather have the characters and stories still be kept to the companies they own instead of the characters entering into the public domain, I prefer the original ones
Hey man how did you know about my pants
Disney is in a terminal death spiral. Between the 'woke' nonsense, the remaking of classics along 'progressive' and 'race-washing' lines,  the de-incorporation of the Reedy Creek Improvement District. and the public domain entry of much-loved characters it's hard to see that they will continue without a massive injection of completely new creativity.
Fnaf vid?
I find the idea of bright and colorful IPs being twisted into something dark rather amusing. Like Smile HD, a show-accurate MLP parody video of Pinkie Pie murdering her friends in graphic gore. Something as bright as MLP being twisted into murder.
"yes you, sitting there without your pants on" I feel seen MatPat, I feel seen.
The darkness face of Disney world
What Id like to know is how they are able to display all of these titles and trademarks in this video, without getting in trouble themselves
superman no supa man
Not sure if you got the Trade Mark quite right.  Trademarks on names (words) is very very complex.
Yep, 2024 is gonna be Disney’s worst year because Mickey’s going public domain
9:35 Surprised MatPat didn’t mention Brightburn considering it’s basically a horror style retelling of a childhood Superman.
These videos always make my day.
Saw this in theaters. It was fun even it it wasn't the greatest.
I couldn't put a pin on why winnie looked so unconfortable and absolutely haunting, but I just figured it out, it has a very similar style to the fnaf game JR's, and that game scared the crap out of me.
Nope it's a nightmare matpat can't step so low to make a theory about one of horror's WORST movies made (and I watched MANY horror movies bad and good). Not our Mathew patrick he only makes theories about popular stuff after we've begged him too unless.....OK which one of ya'll spanned matpat to make a video about THAT of all things?! Come out!
Why is joe swanson holding matpat captive
Huh.   Disney is Lawful Evil.   Who knew.
Can't wait for Bambi the horror movie
OK, but like you have to kind of agree, a Mickey Mouse mob boss movie would be kind of cool actually like once like Mickey Mouse and Marcos friends go to Papa, Dominic, but actually ever happens. The idea is cool as the whole premise of payments be like the same character shoes off like Mickey Mouse being like the big my boss I was wanting to buy everybody else out target and smaller companies taken and Yaya you?
Where is the vita carnis theory
Best satire movie
so would this mean we're getting nick cage as supes for real now?
Mickie-the-mouse And the bloody trap
nah, disney’s worst fear its krakens vs mermaids movie that is going to destroy their “remake” of the little mermaid checkboxes cashgrab
14:25 Says t-shirts for men and women, but doesn't specify for those who do not fall under those two categories, y'know what to do
i thought it was a weird fnaf knockoff in the thumbnail lol
Now parents who don't want to support or endorse Disney can read Winnie the Pooh to their children again?
I actually quite liked the movie. I've always been really into bad horror movies. I think they're great, so seeing a bunch of them based on childhood Disney movies is dope.
Copyright law for most things (images/music/words) is so obsolete with the modern internet. I think if we shortened copyright law back to its original length things would be better. but hey this video really shows how you shouldn't give disney more money if you don't have to. they are a pretty awful company considering 90% of their hits were stolen from public domain stories, which would have been deemed illegal (or they'd have to pay a ton of money to the original owners/heirs) with modern IP laws.
Hey if they are able to make it, cool.
I think people should be allowed to donate stuff to their respective governments so that it could be used for free by the public
I like how alot of people hate this movie yet matpat still does a theroy on it.
I've noticed the addition of the Steamboat Willie animation into the Disney logo, but I always thought it was just a fun reference and callback to the origins of the company, a way to honor their heritage. I never realized that it was a skeezy way to dodge copyright law. That kinda makes me feel bad.
Huh, and I thought Sherlock Holmes was already in the public domain. I have seen that character taken I some weird directions, like an manga where he was reincarnated as a puppy that can only be understand by one character when he have an smoking pipe in his month
1.47  guilty 🤫
The Peter Pan horror... yeah that one already exists in literary form. The book is called Lost Boy. And while it may not appear as a horror (and I would agree that it can be discussed whether it's horror or not) but once you start to think about it as a backstory, it becomes a bit chilling.
😮😮
I know Jakeneutron has already covered it all, but I want to see more people talk about Oswald The Lucky Rabbit. Jake currently made a whole new look, with the name Public Ozwald. It isn't a "theory-must" but if anyone on the theory team is reading this, definitely look into it. It's an interesting thing going on right now-
11:15 wtf happened to ya voice lol
Wow
why does his voice change at 11:15
velocipastor theory when?
The OG Superman has potential in the isekai genre. Imagine supes dropped in to a random fantasy world where his original powers basically turn him into an overpowered noob. Exploring superman as an isekai character would be interesting. Does he try to maintain a dual identity in a world where people having powers is commonplace? Does he try to return to Earth? Does he become a city protector, or immediately start powering up to take on the big-bad, or start as a heroic city protector before getting roped into larger scale plots? How does he handle the realization that he's not invincible in a world full of magic, and actually has to risk his life during heroics?
Mickey Mouse has such a distain for Matpat, it's pretty much been a running gag of film theory
"You sitting at home without your pants on." Me: *Looks down. Pants are definately on*  "Don't scare me like that, MatPat."
1:48 hey just because I'm wearing camo pants doesn't mean I'm not wearing any >:(
Sometimes I am wondering if trade mark can make it impossible to make up a name for a character without including dashes or so, same goes for phrases or business names. Will there once be a time where trademark will have to be looked on and changed to not end up in a world where any new word cannot be made.
Hopefully it means they are forced into more unique ideas.  I do gotta admit wanting to avoid these rip offs, but it will be interesting.
I don’t know a single person who uses Tumblr anymore
...   We will wait for sewden to make a horror movie about mickey
Matpat where's final fnaf lore
Bruh
I find it creepy that you knew I had no pants on😟😳
Matpat we need a video on how rich is Gomez Addams?!!
Soose said from gravity falls lost legends a d that looks like g too
A horror movie with Mickey Mouse would be quite unique
capitalist hellscape
Very interesting and informative! It is sad what people consider entertainment. Pooh on ruining Pooh!
Copyrights need to go back to the original 14 years.
W kingdom hearts references
B rated horror movies are the best 😂 I like to watch one with friends every Sunday
5:47 Oh MatPat, you forget about a certain "34th rule" of the internet, that poor gaggle of living stuffed animals has already entered a form of public domain.
1:46 was way too accurate 😅
Go ahead, Disney...show this movie in the theaters in China...uncensored.  WE DARE YOU!
copyright week??????
this theory misses some legal context, so far courts have ruled against copyright holders when any plot point is uncopyrighted , they are not willing to nitpick
Check out the grinch horror movie called The Mean One
Nostaliga Berries?  Weird, we all call them 'Memberberries.  I see what you did there.
so bright burn was the superman horror movie now we got winnie the pooh
Does yugi have 200 IQ
11:38 That's a D 🤯, I'm 20 and didn't know  Thought it was a backwards G, because they messed up
I thought Winnie the pooh was China's biggest fear
When will the last fnaf timeline video come out???? I tought it was today but today is over in 20 minutes now.
I mean, they could have AT LEAST made him animatronic...  😢
matpat is sick
hey. I have my pants on. they're unbuttoned, but they're on >:(
I was on the toilet while watching this. Matpat called me out with his comment of you with your pants off.😅😅
Frebby Fazbear
Ironic that one of the things that allowed Disney to ascend to dominance could also be a major part of their downfall.
Is the title “bloody bouncing buddy” copyright? 🤣 cuz they should use that
How do you know I have no pants
I have a bucket of machetes.
And it is a video like this that can try to end it. The same way outrage over attempts to make exceptions to copyright law can cause outrage on the internet to the extent to make corporations back off to protect their brand from audience separation- the same audience that gives them their money to begin with- raising awareness of the legal loophole of trademarks creates the same vocal pressure to see things changed. All it takes is an organizer; someone who can unify the outrage and use it to bring a court case into existence over the overlap between copyright and trademark to change the rules of one or both of them. All that remains is a question of HOW the rules will change. Will public domain be abolished in its entirety as courts rule in favor of leaving trademarks unchanged and adapting copyright to match, or will public domain be saved as serious limitations are put on corporations' ability to use trademark as a shield to bypass copyright? The same Disney that created all of these original works that needed protection no longer exists, instead being replace by a hivemind known as a corporation that have hijacked the name for the sake of making money; a corporation which is so creatively bankrupt and money-focused that they have abandoned creativity to try and circumvent copyright preemptively by regurgitating classics without the same heart and just enough differences to claim their trademark is still in effect. (the live-action remake plague is almost certainly an excuse for this exact loophole that people have been blind to, instead seeing the "nostalgia-bait" aspect of it exclusively. Spoiler alert, that is exactly what "nostalgia-bait" is, even if used for the surface level money printing people first assume: a way to extend trademark, intentionally or not.)
How nieve you poor soul you you still think micky is going to be public domain...
There's already a superman horror movie called bright burn
The part at the end involving the change in Disney animation’s opening was eye-opening.
Man f*ck Disney
How did he know if it have pants on
How are you able to use all these characters in your videos then?
While the writing was pretty bad, the visuals were decent considering the budget
I am surprised you didn't mention oswald the lucky rabbit,
I'm pretty sure I saw Tigger in the original Winnie the Pooh book.
Anybody else hear MatPat turn into Kermit the frog every so often?
"Yes you, without your pants on" Matpat got me good man
What EVEN is lol. Is that even grammatically correct. I’ve heard it so much 😂😂.
Why did Matt become Kermit 😂😂😂 11:16
Am I the only one that thinks that there need to be public domain colors? Like colors that companies can't trademark so that other things can be created? And that the vast majority of colors should be public domain?
Oh man i cant wait for a superman horror movie.
I think "brightburn" is a very smart and entertaining rip-off of superman without legal complications.
F**** you Mat Pat. How did you know I didn't have my pants on?!
Was Winnie……Joe Swanson?????
Cover Pikmin please
It's a trap.
Is the pibby glitch possible? Pls answer this.
I like how mat pat assumes I have my pants off
Is it just me or do some sections of the voice over sound like MatPat is talking through his nose? Or someone is doing an impression of him?
Supperman Supman Suppman Supsman sup-er-man hmm
1:49 How did you know that? 🙃
I watched this video and realized I AM AT DISNEY WORLD RIGHT NOW!
is this why The Last Airbender movie couldn't be called Avatar since James Camron had it for just movie titles but the TV show was fine.
Was that a light jab at a certain youtube channel that tried to copyright the word "react" a little while ago? Or am I reading way too much into that :P
👍🏿
1:48 HOW DID YOU KNOW.
The movie shouldn’t have been made!
So US companies can't register characters? Or did they just not bother?
The return of absolutely horrible horror slasher films. Cinema is in the process of healing.
FIRST COMMENT
I'm freaking out right now i watched this episode in my dream last night HEH?!?
Wait how did you know I didn’t have my pants on(I was pooping)
I would buy a shirt called The Pooh Winnie.  It's a medical issue, don't ask.
"Yes you, sitting at home without your pants on."  HEEEEY
but can I use Pete the Cat as a background character?
-999999999 Social Credit Points from West Taiwan as their Pooh Leader isn't pleased by this lols
A new super-man horror movie sounds amazing
Matpat  Said: now this is my movie a movie that ruin childhood
I'm looking forward to the Mickey Mouse torture house that'll come out next year as Disney watches in horror as we ruin all their characters 😂
Ah, Not Disneys "Robin the mind-numbingly sadistic Hood", coming to a cinema near you (Dear Lord, I hope not - that's my favourite Disney!)
While other countries do have their own copyright laws, any country looking for a free trade agreement with the USA quickly discovers that intellectual property protection is among the highest priorities of USA negotiators. To wit, USA copyright law matters globally.
hey man why are ya calling me out?!😂🤣
Hey MatPat! Can you make a Kamen rider Theory?
i thought part three of fnaf time line was dropping today
I guess the wonderful thing about Tigger is that he’s the only one.. until 2024 at least
No offense, but you guys have covered the "Mickey Mouse Law" a couple of times on the channel. It's kind of BS that Disney has virtually written copyright law several times by now. The fact it's up to 90 years now is insanity and completely because of Disney.
I feel like I watched this video before. Why?
Trademark is a fun one and there's a little bit Matt Patt or his team either missed or glossed over. Public Domain Properties aren't as protected by trademark and if a design and logo is too much associated to a Character then it can't be trademarked or protected by trademark.
Hey… don’t call me out… I just took my pants off for a shower and Mat said “you without your pants on” 1:48
Dont be too hopeful about Mickey, Disney ALWAYS renews his lease, theres a literal claus for him that basically legally obligayes the government to keep extending Disneys icon to STAY under copyright effectively forever. Why is simple: Walt got screwed by Corporations once, he WOULD NOT be made a fool of again
dude could you do a helluva  boss theory thatd be awsome and theres animatronics or one?
I love Footofafeiret
To be perfectly honest, this isn't even the worst movie this film company put out. The Humpty Dumpty movie was ten times worse, and I'm someone who genuinely loves horror as a medium and can usually find something good about every horror movie.
Sooo ... Mickey Mouse is the theorist universe's Satan.
I wouldn’t mind a horror movie about a villain being hunted down by Superman or Batman
How did you know I was wearing no pants? are you watching me??
now how did he know i had no pants on?
I love that people called the movie bad. Don't get me wrong, most definitely was (saw clips) but if you go into a Winnie the Pooh slasher expecting some masterpiece kinda on you. The concept already tells you the movie is gonna be bad.
THEY DARE BISMIRCH THE NAME OF THE GREAT BIG POOH!? THEY DIDN'T EVEN DO IT THE COOL WAY
To late Matthew, Germany was already ahead of you. @malternativ
So how risky would it be to give superman flight? Are they really going to argue flight as a concept unique to the creation of Superman, instead of just a general idea that so many supernatural characters have nowadays.
I’m getting tired of Mat calling Mickey a villain when it’s Disney. Blame the real people, not fictional characters.
Why Matpat calling me out for not wearing pants 😂😂
Why did he start sounding like Kermit the Frog at 11:15?
Superman horror exists… it’s a film called Brightburn
I honestly think a Ring style horror movie based on the original steam boar willy cartoon would be awesome
The time on the thumbnail was covering up the h so I though it said poob
1:50 Excuse you Matpat. I'm actually sitting at home WITH pants on and no shirt. Checkmate.
oof
WE CAN PLAY JUST LIKE PIGLET DID.
There's a reason they're using all these trash live action reboots, as well.
matpat, please do another gamelab. you havent done one in 6 years and those were so cool
There's probably going to be Disney controlled genocide once the mouse leaves their grasp.
Follow the money. That's what copyrights, trademarks, etc, it's all about money - who owns the product to make money off it. It's nothing directly to do with the story,  expression, or interpretation of those original characters - it's that they[corporations] own them in total and they can use their assets how they choose, unencumbered, and make all that consumer money directly.  Look at the drama with ms & sony over this activision/blizzard acquisition. It's about the loss of a consumer product for sony, which would make them lose money in their perspective, so sony's legally attacking ms. Sadly this'll never change on a grand scale as it is.
Are we really that UNCREATIVE that we have to recycle old ideas? 🤦🏼‍♀️ I just published my first novel and even in 100 years when I’m dead, if someone took the characters/world/whatever and recycled it, I wouldn’t be mad, I would be worse - disappointed. Brand new ideas are what grab peoples attention. If 5,000 people/companies just restructure an already existing piece of text, movie, etc, that’s not interesting - that’s just a money grab and not art. To me, others might see it differently, but to me - that’s the key sign of someone who shouldn’t be in their job/industry.
bro i was watching this with a shower towel how does he know? 1:50
Trademarks should die too.
1:47 “to you with out you’er pants on”💀
F*ck disney.
Pretty sure legal eagle already did this exact video
Omg I’m actually not wearing any pants 😂
LEGAL LOOPHOLES me freezes and shock
Imagine what the future will think of Winnie the Pooh. They either know of the past Pooh that is the honey-loving, adorable bear, or the scary, killer Pooh. I just hope the idea of the honey-loving, adorable bear keeps up with the future, as with original ideas of past animated characters.
People using the internet to manipulate massive corporations? We need more of that and in large quantities.
What about parodies matpat can they copyright them because they imitate the actual content?
This is one of the most curious theories... Wonder if my craziness can eventually be counted as canon soon?..
Why does Winnie the Pooh in the intro sound like a budget Joe Swanson
I think mat pat should do a theory on the monument mythos
2556th
“Yes you sitting at home without your pants on.” Me: on the toilet *quickly checks room for cameras*
Public domain's best non offical friend is Disney
You sitting at home without your pants on. That foresight right there
So if this happens to Mickey Mouse then it would be sad………… but also if Mickey sadly enters the public domain then if anyone remembers the video or fnf mod of sad mouse basically Mickey going from sad to insane cause he’s been trap in an infinite loop by satin himself driving Mickey into insanity killing him self front hat insanity so if he enters the public domain and someone of horror movies makes a sad mouse movie of Mickey going insane and enters the real worl it would be a massacre wich I hope it dosnt happen to our little mouse friend
How tf did he know I wasn’t wearing pants
Mouse of Mayhem - coming soon to theaters near you
This is a slap in the face for Disney
you think that's disney's worst fear? what about xi jinping?
Everyone tryna copy Sharknado success
soooo brightburn 2 anouncment coming soon?
🧍‍♂️
Using that animation only works if they didn't copyright the ideal originally. I haven't looked but knowing disney back then, they most likely already did.
Copyright theory when
Why winnie the pooh spund like joe swanson
I wish Joey ended up with Emma :(((
To be honest if someone doesn't want to get sued by Disney they just need to swap the colors on the original Mickey Mouse
For something Disney has taken such a strong advantage of (movies based on Public Domain fairytales) they sure are scared of it.
The way Jojo part 6 Stone Ocean Incorporated well-known IP characters would be a cool way going forward. It's like in a way they used the real word IP but had them done so it looked more like that universe's version of those characters.
The Prototype: Appears Me: “New Poppy Playtime theory?!”
EY WHERE IS THE CIMPLETE TIME LINE OF FNAF??????
"You fool....I'M ACTUALLY WEAR PANTS! *MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH* "
1:45 How did you know my pants weren’t on?😢
The new FNaF movie looks wild.
Matpats voice was strangly off around 11:30-12:00, was it just a rerecording or an AI voicing experiment? Also around 14:50
"It actually belongs to you. Yes you, sitting at home without your pants on. Literally you" 💀
Parody laws have entered the chat.
this copyright talk reminds me of the finebros's react world and makes me laugh
I love that I paid real actual money to watch this stupid movie.
Welp, it happened.
Government cant do much except getting together to ban tiktok
This was really a bad movie I rarely regret watching a movie but damm this one sucks
I will never look at the Marvel Studios logo the same again...
Pooh sounds like kronk
Pooh: I will now take over the South China sea
16:07 But you didn’t have to cut me off……..
Waiting for the grinch horror movie
This movie made me so upset bc Winnie the Pooh is my special interest that has been a safe space and comfort franchise for me so it REALLY upsets me and disturbs me and just makes me so incredibly upset that this was the first thing that happened once Winnie the Pooh became public domain like STOP RUINING MY COMFORT THINGS JUST SO YOU CAN BE EDGY OR WHATEVER 😭
To be honest it didn't getting will be think we're getting when Mickey Mouse's copyright ends we're really just getting the original Mickey Mouse and not the newer one plus Disney doesn't even use the old Mickey Mouse anyways so it's kind of not that big of a deal
So um, fanfiction exists
Is that Patrick Warburton?
"Yes, you, sitting at home without your pants on."  Aaaannd that's not a theory, that's a fact
… §«„“¿¡'‰≠≈¿¡
Superman will be undercover, and have no logo on his suit...
Man this movie could have been so good 😂 I actually was pumped for a psychological child trauma exploring, bloody, Pooh movie… but then it had no plot at all and didn’t play up enough into the humor of the whole thing. Can’t say I’m disappointed cause I wasn’t expecting much I was at least hoping to laugh more and I didn’t.
10:50 is that another teaser like the old style theory teaser ?
I hope one of these movies is eventualy good
Is it just me or did mat sound weird when he started explain trademarks
hey film theorist when well spongebob be public domain  ?
I enjoyed this movie. It's not good, funny or scary.. But it is fun.
Killer Pooh: "TOO BAD!!"  MatPat: "NOOOOO~!"  Me: "He sounded like Kronk. HA!"
I would like to suggest a horror analog called Vita Carnis made by Darian Quilloy, it's a horror analog series that surrounds organic meat that arrived on the planets surface here is a link to the first video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIuJVtXYEHU
"You at home with your pants off" I hear while pulling down my jeans 😳🤣
I wanna see That movie  not crappy
Nice.
2:46 micky enter the provlic domain in 2024... rule 34...it cannot be stopped
It's so ridiculous considering how they used other people's works to help build their brand
i am shocked you didnt bring up bright burn, which is basically ALREADY superman the horror movie
do grimcutty
HOW DID U KNOW I HAD NO PANTS ON
1:49 im pooping in the bathroom
Did you get kronk/joe for that voice for Pooh??
Is the fnaf timeline still releasing today?
"It belongs to you, user at home without your pants on"  *How...how did he knew?*
Honestly speaking, a horror movie around Pooh bear or the Grinch (not Disney, I know) isn't that scary. A scary movie involving Michael Eisner? Now that I wanna see.
Matt Pat calling me out for not having pants on while I watch this in the bathroom.
Does MatPat's voice get deeper as the video goes on?
When does the og Godzilla become public domain?
film thoery on the transformers rise of the beasts scourge toy theres alot of insignias aka logos of decepticons autobots wreckers mercs and maximals maybe predacons do a thoery on scourge that he murdered Megatron in the past and thats why he never exsisted in the bumblebee movie LORE BABY LOOOOOOOOOOORE
"You see that iconic Disney logo on something, the one that looks like a signature with the D that kinda looks like a G" Is nobody gonna mention that weird Y that makes it look like it says Disnep???
the most important detail of Gandalf the grey is his hat is Blue. You use a Grey hat like in the Movie Warner bros gets to come after ya. The devil in the details. it's better to do Sherlock Holmes adaptions then Micky Mouse or Tolkien spin offs.
And people wonder why they keep making remakes.
Feels like this shouldn’t get a theory.
Actually kinda wana see the Neverland nightmare.
Return of the evil Mickey
I can’t wait for the public domain cinematic universe
Who the heck is talking at like 11:12? Unless Matt has a burp or hiccup stuck in his throat? It's like someone else speaking for a sentence then right back to Matt...I'm confused of im just hearing things or if I'm just uh...🍃 To put it lightly 😅
How..... How did you know I wasn't wearing any pants ???? Literally just took them of
hi
To be honest Peter Pan  does not need to get ruined cuz he was already evil but they would just flat-out said it unlike Disney Peter Pan is a good person at heart oh he is not he is a crazy person who is psychotic in the book evil and hook should not have been the villain Peter Pan should have been the villain
bro used buckingham palace as an american government building 💀
1:45 bro I did not need to be violated like that 😭💀
1:49 how did you know
So essentially, if a property enters public domain, that character becomes up for grabs, but specific interpretations are NOT. That about right?
11:15 his voice sounded like Kermit the frog for a moment
Interesting
Why in the beginning pooh sounds like joe from family guy I'm not the only one that hears it right😂
10:40 Ha ha, it's the theory colors.
So what is it. Micheal myers dressed as winne the pooh?
I’m in the bathroom how did he know
Wait, you can't use copyright characters in fanfiction? I thought that was the whole point of fanfiction
and there's a Mickey  vhs
Ironically I kept telling my friends "someone should turn Disknee movies into horror movies" can't believe someone actually did that LMAO
You'dcthink that the Banana Splits movie would have been a warning.
matpat learned the word nebulous recently and is boasting it in all new theories thus far film & style check
I hate when someome does that they took something nice and make it a assasin monster clown killer
"Bambi: The Reckoning" is the stupidest fricking name ever
I can tell you exactly how itll go. Disney is going to bribe US government again, copyright will get extended, youll be watching remake number 30267 and youll not be able to do anything about it. Because US government works for corporations, not people.
That’s on God
1:47 excuse me I have my pants on good sir
Why did matpat sound like Kermit the frog at some points
“FNAF FINAL TIMELINE COMING THIS SATURDAY!” U a capper n a nerd can’t even get his hw done on time
Still hoping for that 'which of Pooh's friends is the most nutritious?' video.
😐 I can't anymore
Why focus on the US copyright system? Cause it's the Oldest Copyright system and all other copyright systems are either Off shoots and/or legal parodies of it. Until 1790 the concept of Intellectual Property was just things Academics had debated on for the last few centuries.
well this isn't the only one of the Winnie the Pooh there's actually Roblox one
with the superman thing i can imagin a sceen whith him in it and other caricters are like weres youre logo and super man hushes them becos dc owns it
For the trademark issue  There’s a Supreme Court case called Dastar vs Fox Basically years ago Fox made a show called Crusade of Europe based on the book by Dwight Eisenhower  Though the books copyright was renewed the tv show wasn’t and the show entered the public domain in 1977 In 1988 a media company named Dastar took the footage and recompiled them into a new product So Fox took them to court and it went all the way to the top Fox tried to use there trademarks to justify it since the copyright expired  In a shocking decision the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Dastar claiming that using trademarks to inhibit creative works from being used in the public domain Would create a mutant copyright that would limit the public’s right you use public domain works If Disney sues over trademark the defendant could use this Supreme Court case to win
Bro? I swear I feel like there is something different in ur voice at the later part of the video like it's another person or something
They can't touch Peter pan man that's some bullshit
12:52 Souperman  Bottom text
2:42 Welp look like we're getting treasure island movie or mickey creepypasta movie some of that
💅💃
Could a film-maker just put a clear notice at the start of the movie that it is not a Disney product and or expressly say that consistently in advertising?
https://youtu.be/YapmVFpggt0
Bro I'm done
I was in the middle of changing when I heard “you without your pants on “😢
A Mouse Named Mickey, where no one calls him Mickey and just the mouse where he hunts down people on a ship in squeaks that sounds like whistles
Not to like a corporate boot, but honestly...why do we feel the need to take Micket Mouse from Disney?   Sure these laws protect Disney's less than loveable leadership....but they also protect my buddy's tiny entertainment company from having their logo snatched with non recourse.
I just realized that Jack used a similar thumbnail when reacting to Mat's video on the Iris project, I have a bad feeling guys
did anyone else notice from 11:15 to like 11:20 matpat sounded like he had a different voice?
I'm actually shirtless matpat, jokes on you
Whens style theory coming out? I feel like a lot of dudes here (and me) can learn a lot from it
Am I going crazy or is Matpats' voice deeper in some of these newer videos? Like, when you watch gt live, it sounds normal, but in the theories, it's like it's been altered to be deeper 🤔
Wait so if I’m as to make a Superman movie I can’t take creative freedoms and change the suit or powers

There's one problem with the whole "trademarking Steamboat Willie to keep it out of the public domain" strategy: copyright law is actually designed to prohibit this kind of legal shenaniganery.  The reason for this actually has to do with music recordings: before you could copyright them a bunch of US states made their own perpetual copyright regimes around sound recordings. Congress didn't stop the issuing of new state recording copyrights until *1976* and the existing ownership didn't get rolled into federal law until SEVERAL YEARS AGO with the Music Modernization Act. To stop this Constitution-circumventing nonsense, Congress added 17 USC 301 - "Preemption with respect to other laws". If something looks like a copyright, and quacks like a copyright, then it has to be handled under federal copyright law and nothing else.  So if Disney tries to argue that you merely using Steamboat Willie in your YouTube Poop or something is a trademark violation because Disney put the frames of the movie in their logo... that is not going to hold water.
They can't trademark pooh's undersized red t-shirt. That was based on the pictures in the book, which Disney only adapted. The book trumps the cartoon. It wasn't their creation.
OKAY BRO HOW DID YOU KNOW I ONLY HAD UNDERWEAR ON
I was changing my trousers when he said you sat in your pants phaha
The main problem is going to be that people likes to copy other works. You can call it being a "fan" of the persons work but if you are copying it then you aren't really a fan of their work. Doing something simliar is completely different taking some of their ideas and making it your own. You can see that with Marvel and DC as the have simliar heroes. When it comes down to it we have books that are simliar as well which no one finds wrong with that. No one out right copies a book and try and make a book. Sure it is nice to have these characters but you can make your own mickie mouse. You can change the name and the way his shorts are. Yet the problem is with terrible movies like that Winnie the pooh movie. It's more bad on the image of the character. It's a loveable character but if some child saw this because their parents was watching it at night then that child wouldn't like Winnie anymore. Sure people might have seen the movie but eventually no one will want to see movies like that at all. They will consider it a waste of money and movie places will be empty as we can just look at the movies online or just wait until they are online. You won't have to waste 20$ or whatever to see a crap movie.  They are running out of ideas and ruining different things so watch out for anyone who has favorite animes or anything. Movies are out to ruin what you love to watch.
That means Gofer also wouldn't be fair game cause he wasn't introduced until Disney
WHERE IS FNAF!!!!??????????????????
Film idea: Winnie the pooh X gta5  .  Winnie the pooh honey and money
Was we supposed to get a fnaf theory today
The way my jaw dropped when the Disney logo change came up. I remember seeing that when they first changed it in a movie theater and really thought nothing of it. This changed my life.
He knew I wasn’t wearing pants In the morning in the morning
Well Disney did mess with the original Public Domain laws making it only become public domain after 70 years when the original owner dies
Oh wow. I haven't seen the Pooh slasher movie. However I found out about it on the internet. There is also a Bambi one. I also know about copyright, and how it expires. It is interesting to see Matt Patt have his take one that. There are some surprising things on the channel. One is that Superman was not able to fly in his original comic book. What the heck?! If he can't fly, then what is the cape for? That is so weird. I hope Batman always has this ability. He is based on a flying animal after all.   Another surprising thing is that trademark is a big loophole. That is messed up. I think trademarks should expire like copyright, whether they are used or not. I would like to erode the power of big business. A trademark limit would help, because it would make the business mortal. A business has to reinvent itself or die. I think Disney would be okay. They just need to redesign their branding. Of their recent movies, Frozen has become a really big hit. There is so much merch around Frozen and its sequel that it became its own brand. One weird side effect is that Anna and Elsa were never put into the Disney Princess brand officially. They stayed in their own Frozen brand. The Disney Princess brand is a whole other can of worms. One can make a whole theory video about who gets in and who is left out. Matt Patt may have done a video like this before. I am not sure though. Anna and Elsa are unique for having their movie make too much money for them to fit in. It is an odd excuse, I know. If Micky goes into public domain, it is not the end for Disney. Disney has a ton of character. They can pluck a popular one out of the crowd, and make them a new mascot. Elsa is my favorite Disney character. She is also a really popular one, and from a successful movie. So she could take Micky's place and become the new mascot for Disney as a whole. Since she is a new character, she won't go into public domain for a very long time. I guess another option is to redesign Micky like he always has. Then newer versions can replace the older ones, as the older ones go into public domain. If someone is eager to make their own Frozen fan work, don't fret. There is a major loophole. Frozen is essentially the Disney version of an old fairytale the Snow Queen. They can't get sued by Hans Christian Anderson. If they can do it, anybody else can. So one needs to read the original Snow Queen and then do some adaptation or spinoff of that. That should be good enough for starters.
Was we supposed to get a fnaf theroy today
One of the best movies I have seen. There is no good ending like how it’s supposed to be. People probably hate on it because it is a big man bear that kills off a bunch of women who act like women in real life.
9:26 wtf is she writing about with a face like that
1:47 *me watching this while on the toilet* 😱
The edgy Mickey was Nomura's idea
Why did they ruin Winnie the Pooh 😢😢 my childhood, thank goodness tigger isn't in it
I could have sworn The Fellowship of the Ring came first. My copy of the book, which is old enough to not have a barcode, has a copyright detail that says:  "©George Allen & Unwin, Ltd., _1937_ , 1951, 1966". My copy appears to be the "Forty-third Printing: September, 1973" according to that same copyright page. My copy of The Hobbit is, by way of contrast, newer. New enough to not only have a barcode, but also a website URL, and acknowledgement of the Lord of the Rings motion picture trilogy from New Line Cinema. Judging by the use of a painting rather than a frame from the film, and the implication of the completed film trilogy being recent, I appraise this at being from the early to mid 2000's. Anyway, the copyright page is less thorough, it also says: "Copyright ©1937 George Allen & Unwin, Ltd.". This is the earliest date listed on _both_ books. And furthermore, in The Hobbit it says: " _Revised Edition_ | First Printing: January 1982". So if thou intends to reinterpret or adapt The Hobbit, watch thy step!
How’d he know that I didn’t have pants on 🤨
So... do a Superman with heat breath and ice vision 😂
You know I kind of get why companies fight so hard to keep their characters from my point of view it's that's my creation I don't want no one else using it
I'm on my throne watching an when he said "yes you without your pants" I was like how did he know
im waiting for a remake of the movie "the interview" with winnie the pooh as the leader of north korea.
Very interesting and entertaining, good job Mathew Patrick from Film Theory
My friend and I wrote a story via text message,  where winnie the pooh was caught smuggling drugs, pooh ended up getting murdered with an axe by piglet who turned out to be the kingpin.
A new poo
1:48 How did he knoooow😢
Anyone else thought of  "The new adventures of Winnie the Pooh" intro after this video?
MatPat you put me in a terrible position, you released a Film Theory and a Style Theory at the same time! How dare you make me choose which to watch first?!
Ah, a quick note MatPat; before you complain about those horror movies sharing a universe, I raise you Kingdom Hearts. Once again, Disney has done this to themselves. 🤣
So whena dragonball gonna be public domain?  I wanna make a saiyaman series thats remenisant to batman tas & superman tas
..
Memberberries Matthew. 😂
Bold claim I am at my house mat
Am I tripping or does his voice sound a little different at parts
Ummm actually i don't have a SHIRT on
really had to call out my pantlessness
Didint u make a video about this a while ago v
THIS WAS AT 1:09 WHERE IS THE LAST FNAF TIMLINE VID
First
I thought this was about winnie the pooh
if my man walt sees what the new people have done to his company
I love your videos so much
1:48 how did you know?
4:03 I'm mean we could be anything as a theorist we learn all the rules law and basically everything just to make a theory 😂
Nah these intros are getting so good!
it would be interesting to see a follow up episode of this talking about how companies can lose even their trademark because the wording itself becomes common use. I heard something along the lines of Kleenex does not want their name being used interchangeably with a tissue like, "can you pass me a Kleenex" and really you are just asking for any type of tissue paper. When a company's word is used for the generic meaning of that word those companies can lose the rights to that word itself. If we started using "mickey" to refer to every mouse we see I wonder if the same would be true.
Oooooo  You're  sparking IDEAS  in my head now!  You've made a monster  Matpat
I like Disney movies, but I don't like Disney corporation. That's why I wholeheartedly support any indie creator who finds the way of using Mickey Mouse.
I wanted to print out a book of music for the clarinet, and so I looked up a list of public domain music, believing it would be all classical stuff. But I was surprised to see names like Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Harold Arlen...I hadn't realized some of the great songs that are now in the public domain.
This movie honestly made me think that maybe the public domain is a bad idea.
What about movies like the mean one?
Couldn't corporations make the argument that, because copyrights last until the end of the creator's lifetime and corporations are people, as long as a corporation exists, the copyright should exist?
Honestly, I think companies should be allowed to own their characters forever. I mean they are literally their main selling point. It's like if I demanded Food restaurants to hand me their recipes because they were now "Public domain" or something. It just sounds stupid to me. There is no good reason that anyone's characters should become public domain because lord knows what the public will do with them. I don't trust any of the public to do right by mickey. It's better if Disney keeps mickey themselves because they know mickey best.
Huh I didn't know Tigger wasn't in the original book this is why I love these channels theories cause every once and a while mat will just drop a quick detail that's completely new to me I love that
MatPat caught me at the wrong time with my pants on, I guess I don't have the rights to pooh bear
He is preparing His plan to get away. To escape the atrocities He committed. It cannot stop this. But It can tell you the full truth, adjust your view. The clock ticks.
to whoever is making the thumbnails: please keep in mind that the thing that tells you the length of the video hides a bit of the bottom right of the thumbnail, so please stop putting text there
I LOVE connected universes.
Im in the toilet watching this when he said you with your pants down now im scared of matpat
I need a hug please
Mat at this point we have enough leaks and evidence to make a full on theory prediction of the fnaf movie. I have a solid idea how it’s going down and I’m not even a theorist lol
Yeah I know disappointing turns out you can't use mickey mouses image in total anarchy in 2024 :(
Mattrick patthew
Oswald the Lucky Rabbit is getting close to copyright but Disney+ is adding an Oswald short next month.
Once again we rediscover the necessity of abolishing intellectual property.
It is going to be interesting to see who the first person to try and make their own Mickey Mouse cartoon is.
I literally just got my Youtooz figure of Pooh from this movie like 10 minutes ago. Perfect timing.
I wanna see this movie, but it’s only available at one theater closest to me
Matpat has free time on his hands?!
People have always been doing horror things with beloved characters. Worst fear for companies is when it becomes legal and can go on the big screen: public domain
Disneys biggest fear is to not just remake movies in real life
Kronk?
The wonderful thing about MURDER is MURDER is a wonderful thing!
I personally would of loved the original A.A milne books being adapted into a comic book. Not a superman comic book, but a faithful recreation of the stories in picture form.
Should be called 'Winnie the Hoo'. Giving me flashbacks to the live action grinch 💀
I’d love to see a horror movie we’re Mickey and Matpat fight and Matpat wins
Hm
Crappy horror movies are better than what the actual Disney remakes are doing.
Would love to see Disney go defunct.. They ruined Marvel and Star Wars..
SuprMan
Hey didn’t Pooh sound like Patrick Warberton
I remember hearing before that Mickey was supposed to enter public domain a few times already, but oh! what's that? every time his due date was coming close the law on time for entering public domain kept getting extended, and again, and again? wow shocker that the multi-billion dollar company known as disney has their hands in the government's pockets while those hands are in disney"s wallets.
I love how matpat is still holding his chin while tied up in the opening scene
Oh my, this movie is based on real life and the victim are the average Chinese.
Honestly I do get the whole trademark thing, it honestly makes sense to me, but I feel like the point is slightly missed. This movie is not a Disney ripoff, its based on the books, but standard audiences associate it with Disney which puts holes in their brand.   Also like theres plenty of things that Disney may think they have a monopoly on that they don't. Like for example any of their fairy tale movies, since trying to copyright a fairy tale is like trying to copyright greek myth. Just not gonna fly.  (I dont know if what I'm saying is making sense at this point but I hope the message still gets through)
10:05 wait wait there was a mickey mouse before steamboat willey called "plane crazy mickey mouse" does that mean I can use him in like a few months?
Should have made a Law Theory channel instead of whatever fashion theory is.
Don't tell the Chinese but xie jing ping is in this movie
How did he know?!?
What about the WTP movie by the Dreamworks alumni?
I think you need to make an episode about Bluey. It’s a truly amazing show, enjoyable for both children and adults, sometimes having two separate messages for both audiences. The attention to detail and the small mentions about people owning dogs in the show like in the episode “BBQ” makes this a perfect candidate for Film Theory’s evil-lizing of children’s shows.
Fun fact: Rabbit is in fact NOT a stuffed animal, but a living, breathing rabbit.
Disney’s worse nightmare is Kathleen Kennedy…
What is this game
Oh my gosh! I actually don't have my pants on...
Lean of the origins and realize it was all based on stuff that happened that they made into kids stories to keep them in the dark about the truth. Remember Acadia.
Disney owns the world in 3 weeks Disney wall in the world none of us will be safe
I forsee the re-starting of the Superman rip-off machine ib the next decade
Trademark
Being specific to what is coming next year - Steamboat Willie is NOT Mickey Mouse and thus the Mickey Mouse trademark doesn't count, Steamboat Willie isn't used enough to be allowed as trade.  Pete also isn't covered.  To use Steamboat Willie, it has to BE Steamboat Willie, THAT very one.  No color, no talk in Mickey's style.  And no, the logo doesn't count, it's too short.  You can call tradark on something a few seconds long if I make an hour long movie.  I have been planning for this year for DECADES.
Copy right the-film-theorist
The mouse has came back
Superman? Nooo, dont do that Supa-Man? Ye, thats how you sell it
How did he know
Thats it. In 2028 i'm going to create a talkshow with Winnie the Pooh where Winnie has very... interesting views.
All I know is that I ain't watching the horror version of Disney films, not only does it shatter the childhood memories of many which is an insult, Im just not into horror.  Besides Matpat does enough childhood ruining so I'll stick with his videos.
Im gonna say it:   *_fnaftheorywhen?_*
HOW DID HE KNOW I WASN'T WEARING PANTS!!?
I wanted to see this movie with my boyfriend but the closest showing was out of state so we couldn't see it
“We don’t own the idea or the format of a theory”  *glares at FineBros*
I honestly think if someone wants to make a story just make up your own characters waiting for characters to be in the public domain seems kinda wrong to me.
how did mat pat know im not wearing pants?
So alright at 1:53 in the video he says people with out pants on or something like that and I just wanted to change into my pajamas and so when he said that I was in shock
So where is the final FNAF episode?? Is it happening tmr?
I'm gonna butcher Disney Golden boy once he becomes public domain
Ah yes. The HMU...the horror movie universe.
Litter box
What I don't understand is how Tigger is not in the public domain yet... Isn't he by the same author? so theoretically its releasedate doesn't matter anymore after 70 years have passed after the authors death? Maybe I missed something
As someone who doesn’t agree with intellectual property, this is fascinating.
This movie is definitely better than The Little Mermaid or Peter and Wendy will be.
This video tough me all about copyright and trademarks, I'm planning on creating my original series of mine, so copyright and trademarks might help me out with it
50% audience score is that bad?
I just suggested watching this movie to my husband!!!! It’s a sign. I definitely want to watch it
Personally I think the last channel should’ve been a history theory channel or something.
1:48 too accurate
This is interesting for me to watch since my cyberethics class covered an entire chapter on copyright, patents, and fair use. So I have a couple of points to add from my own knowledge:  Disney likely would have won the lawsuit against the school that used one of its movies during a fundraiser if they ignored the public's response. The copyright owner has the exclusive right to show its copyrighted work in public, and the school was violating that and then some by presumably charging money to view the film.  Most fanfiction would fall under fair use protections. Fanfiction authors often add their own creative spin to a copyrighted work or will create original content related to characters in copyrighted material. Fanfiction writers also don't make money off their stories, so there's no market effect on the original work. Problems do pop up when people try to make printed copies of their fanfiction because copyright holders have the exclusive right to make copies and translations of their work.
​​​​​​​.          《DWJ
No one. No one at all. MatPat: Lore?
I ain’t even know this movie came out
The next connected universe for MatPat to make a theory about is the random encounters universe (this is only a joke, unless you agree with me. This is Shrödinger’s statement.)
I keep forgetting Winnie the Pooh is from Disney
Disney's worst nightmare  is you
You got SuperMan? Nah bro we got *SOUPMAN*
this movie was cancelled lol
Question, Is the Star Wars extended universe owned by Disney since they decided that it was not canon and tried to trash it all?
MatPat. More like MatFat, FatPat!
There's an argument to be made that these trademarks don't just represent that company's version of the work, but that these trademarks are commonly used to represent most derivative works of the content which is now in the public domain. I'm sure courts would not allow the use of trademarks to circumvent copyright expiry.
I’m not one who usually suggests content, but consider doing a theory on the SFM film emesis blue. It definitely needs some explaining
The thumbnail alone looks like Disney’s worst nightmare.
D
Is it just me or is Matt Pat's voice different when he explains the difference between copyright and trademark?
I learn more here than in school😅
:, "sitting without your pants on" Me: " *offended gasp* I am wearing a dress ofc I am not wearing pants what do expect me to do?"
Joe Swanson
Me after seeing the intro : their real fear Is actually someone eating a rice bowl with a fork in one of their shows
4:08 Please don't lie for relatability, we know no on on team Team Theorist has any free time.
Is that cabin not from that sirn monster game
I thought the nightmare Winnie the Pooh-related would face is the very likelihood of diabetes
eh...Ill just add them as easter eggs to my games at most
Im so hyped to watch this! Was even planning to a while ago but we had a snowstorm that entire week... and this sh*thole country stopped showing it in the cinemas after that.   On the other hand, i can totally recommend Cocaine Bear instead! (should be enjoyed while "over the influence", so to speak (not talking abt cocaine, ftr))
Matt: “So is Disney gonna roll up and pay the government to extend their copyright again?”  Me: “Yes”  Matt: “No, not likely”  Me: “…..I don’t believe you”
1:48 why is this man stalking me. TO THE T.
Whoever you got to impersonate Patrick Warburton in the opening did a great job.
Where's the final fnaf theory >:(
Why are they ruining our childhoods
MATPAT please do a film theory on Murder Drones it is one of the best things i have seen, and it is chalk full of lore. pls pls pls. also the fact that companys can weponize trademarks is kind of depressing and i think that it shouldent be that simple for these companys to controll everything they make for as long as they want.
On my way to create a Supperman lunchbox company.
Why does the Pooh at the beginning sound like Joe Swanson?
Jokes on you Matt patt, I have my pants on, but I don't have a shirt on.
Cant wait for the theory theory.
gotta love public domain
Reminded me of when the Fine Bros tried to copyright “REACT” 💀🤮
these movies are the worst things ever and i will watch ever second of them
Copyright is the enemy of creativity.
Joe Swanson is that you?
where is it matpat
Soon hitting theaters above average man or superb man
How tf you know I don't any pants on?
I actually already knew about this bc of illuminaughtii, its rlly interesting tbh
not trying to be mean or anything but at 11:15 mat starts to sound like ketmit
Also matts voice sounds a bit different just a tiny detail I felt I needed to point out even though no one asked but I do find this job of stating things no one asked quite rewarding so thier it is enjoy your day
Public domain is kinda stupid
I like how this feels like an older video but with that modern edge on it
Phew! I was worried that these legendary creations would enter public domain and get these horrible adaptations and get no credit. These legendary creators may rest in peace knowing their products are in good hands(or at least smart hands)
jokes on you mat pat i do have my pants on
This moive😢is like Jason and wine
7:00 tf2
Creativity would be Disney kryptonite
We don't talk about tiktok theory...
Disney sucks
1:47 how the f- screw you
1:48 How did he know!?
the phoenix whright part is just a normal 32 bit computer
Return to peak fiction
This movie was terrifically bad! Going in with no expectations and you'll come out surprised 😂 It had some great gore/kills which i did not expect! I did cover this one recently if you're interested in a movie discussion of it! I am so excited for this universe, hopefully it'll lead to crossovers Freddy vs Jason style.
It still seems worth it to me
I'm counting the days until the film theorists finally enters public domain 🙃
I believe in the fangirls. They can get creative around the trademark.
1:48 HOW DID YOU KNOW? ARE YOU STALKING ME?????
11:14 - 11:52 why did his voice change am i tripping?
Mat pat legal eagle(lawyer) crossover when
This is why fanfiction exists. We can write whatever we want without getting sued because everything is 100% non-profit
13:03 that's why I write the s backwards
Does anyone else remember the phenomenon of Garfield being turned into a horror show on the Internet, where are those movies because Garfield is also public domain.
4th channel spoiler? 4:53  (I mean probably not but interesting indeed)
Nice.
Super-man the horror movie
So basically, Disney knows how to exploit... sounds about right.
We marked our calendars.
Wow I wanted to watch this horror movie but it’s so bad that all the platforms it was on removed it
You can’t copyright a format? Do the Fine Bros know that?
The fact that low budget horror movies are the only thing that could Navigate their legal mine field... Does honestly sound like a blow to the guts by karma xD
Yes your sitting at home without your pants on??? 1:48
Kinda feels like someone else is talking in random segments
I’m gonna go cry now that I know it’s legal to ruin my childhood
Disney has completely abandoned games since it closed its studio and allowed the characters for Kingdom Hearts. Maybe this could be potential for a wider release for Forgotten House (originally Five Nights at Treasure Island). It got a massive makeover in recent years and looks and sounds amazing. I think the project was officially dropped but it'd be cool to see the creators make some money from the series in some fashion
10:06 wasn't he the chef
Did you get the actual Patrick Warburton to say "MatPat" at the beginning of this video?
is that foafy's voice i hear ?
They shouldnt have trademark be lasting forever, its dumb
Adding the Saiyan tail to Superman was a great wink, good job whoever thought of that one~
Anyone else thinks Matpat sounds weird in parts of this episode?
9:50 I also don't think you could copyright the power of flight. Or X-ray vision.
I like the idea of the original winnie just walking in the public domain, only to stumble into this movie by accident after taking a shady path, and accidentally meet the slasher. "Oh bother, do you need help cleaning off that jam?"
Can't wait to see matpat get attacked by Winnie the Pooh.
Just turn the Superman into the TradeMarkedMan
Real talk, Fnaf Gameplay and Whinnie the pooh is an idea I had ages ago, I think they are if fused, the best potential horror base because they play into not only fear but our childhood like wonder which is an important psychological element of fear
MatPat’s Mickey is BACK!!!!!!
Omg I loved this video!!!!!!
This is an example of "kids shows make great horror games/movies"
Hola
Just thought I would mention, my recommended list did not recommend this video from the Fashion Theorist video about Shein, how to manually come here. Tsk tsk tsk Youtube
Matpat, where is fnaf finale?
mm girl you looking mighty fine today... are those stockings trademarker?
Casually making a theory channel....... huh..... weird
How did mat pat know I had no pants on. I’m scared
MatPat ai voice to fill missing lines? 11:18 🤔
8:29 I don't think Disney could claim copyright over a public domain character wearing a specific coloured shirt. Same way Holmes's author couldn't sue someone for a warm, caring version of Sherlock.
Fun fact. Pooh bear is a female..Winnie short for Winifred
I have to ask did anyone else here the no pants thing
superman and sup, erman are the same thing
No music man? 😢 WINNNNIIIE THE POOOOOOOOOOOOHHHH
🎶This is the ultimate showdown!🎶
Bear + horror = game theory/film theory
Disney childhood has been ruined
Spiderman
When he said “without your pants on” I literally had no pants on. My reaction I was terrified
I wouldn't mind the horror knockoffs existing. Even if they're horrible
Wait xi jin ping?
This movie was peak cinema
Thanks for making me stop panicking about bad spiderman horror films
I thought MatPat was going to talk about the movie. Instead we got a lesson on who copyright and public domain works. He should make another channel that deals with these topics. But hey! That’s just a theory, a copyright theory and case closed!
New video!
I'd rather have the 'Winnie's Adventures in' Cinematic Universe than this
A lot of people confused trademark with copyright during the D&D OGL debacle in January
Its always the mouse
You should make a theory on Murder Drones I bet you’ll all like it
Ye
I loved the movie. Was so weird, but so entertaining. No idea what the reviews are all about
I have an idea for steamboat willie and it’s making him a horror myth that people call “steamboat Willie” and he rides a boat while whistling a disturbing tune, and when you hear it you are next and perhaps that could be related to the plot where there is a family on a lakeside house where willie is located and they have to survive him while they take a boat on the lake
Hi Matpat! I have a question that no many how many times I re-phrase it, google wont answer: Why does “copyright” not allow you to renew it forever? For example, why can’t they just renew after the 14 years end every single time. Is there a point? Thank you and I hope you see this!
Theory idea: how fast can metro man punch?
The fact he knew I didn’t have my pants on should be it’s own theory😂
We need to protect public domain as hard as possible!
"Copyright doesn't protect facts, ideas or systems."  Ain't that right, FINE BROTHERS!?!?! 👀
Bro seriously made me go through my current events class all over again 😂
how did you know that my brother walks around without any pants? you're so smart matpat always one step ahead :D
Bro why did you even bother make a theory about it, what's wrong with you.
the son of Crypton? Journey to The lonely mountain The Bat or The knight of Gotham those are the names I would choose
I can’t wait till you do harmony horror pt2
Peter Pan has been public domain since December 2008. The original novel by J. M. Barrie and its prequel novel, I mean. And in my opinion those are far superior to any Disney adaptation so for all I care they can keep their teenage elf forever. I've been writing about the deeply dark and psychologial story of the 6-year old human boy and his equally young friends instead. I'm so happy Barrie Granted the copyrights to an English children's hospital instead of selling them to any greedy company.
who cares about a stupid mouse? disney is bleeding money it may go bankcrupt if they dont change direction soon
for five seconds you sounded like kermit de frog in the timestamp 11:17
Does he mention the grinch horror movie
Is it me or at some points in this episode you sound like kermit not trying to be mean probably audio issue
joe swatson joe swatson
Disney’s actual worst fear is paying their employees fairly
Just call Superman Supes.
For some reason mid way in theory Mat started to sound like Kermit for me lmao
Diz-nee really love exploiting, perverting, and sticking their fingers into US law. Hopefully it leads to more instances of lawmakers smacking them down, like my home state of Florida.
So I wonder about the shirt. Because disney didn't invent that either, they themselves took it from a picture of Pooh that was published alongside a Poem, Edward Bear. So how come they get to have copyright over that whe this picture of Pooh existed even before the first book which is now public domain did?
11:44 matpat sounds kinda off in this section
❤
Legit, Other people may not agree but 'Peter Pan's original story could actually make for an interesting dark twisted movie (would be better animated)
please do a theory about how Austin Butler is still talking like Elvis
You are starting to sound like dream
One thing about the Disney logo - for me, the y has always looked like a p. Even now I can't unsee it
what if i create a german super hero called Uber mann?
Anyone else notice Matt's voice change DRASTICALLY at 11:15 or was it just me? 🤔 like that sounds like a whole different person 👀.
sounds accurate they would get mad over a fundraiser lol jfc
who here from style theory
Brooo, I literally watched this movie 3 days ago and there is already a video about it
I can already see it. The Rise Of Souperman
Not kidding, before this was announced I was making a horror game about winnie the pooh
I told my mother we missed the boat on making a profit from Pooh and then told her they made a horror movie about him, then I went on to say The Mouse was coming to PD soon. My 50 year old mother just told me to plan in making a porno crossover with Pooh and Steamboat Mickey and went so far as to talk about Pooh's "honey". Help I can't stop laughing.
But the Superman shield has changed quite a bit since the original. Could one use a similar shield to the original, or would it still be covered?
WTF
the biggest piece of dog sh!t out there man. The worst thing human eyes can watch.
This theory reminds me of school. It made me more knowledgeable, AND more depressed!!  I hate Disney man…
*THIS VIDEO COPYRIGHT STRUCK BY DISNEY*
be super interesting if you covered like jm barries peter pan
Superman is trademarked? I'll just create Ultraman or super homosapien 😂😂
Technically, there's already a Superman horror movie. It's called "Brightburn".
When Mickey becomes public domain I hope someone makes Mickey Mouse Clubhouse 2.
This movie is going to ruren my childhood but eh
WITHOUT MY PANTS ON!?!?!? 1:48
1:50 hpw do you know, HOW DO YOU KNOW?
really upset because I JUST took my pants off. Get out of my head Matpat!
Someone should make a compilation of all these cold opens. It would just be really fun to watch.
Is this the scp video again but for film theory
As usual companies are greedy monsters. What has changed? What is the point of public domain when it does not truly exist?
he really removed Quebec from Canada...
7:52 this already exists in a FNF mod in 2021 😅
Hey Matt as far as I understand, you are right about only being able to use the version of character that is entering the public domain. But you can change that character, like give him different powers, evolve his stories differently. Like Public Domain Superman might not be able to use Ice breath, but he can breathe fire. He cannot use laser eyes, but eyes that can freeze people. He cannot fly, but what if he makes a device that aids him to fly. All things are possible once a character is in that Public Domain.
The only thing that was amazing about the Winnie the Pooh movie was that Optimus Prime was there.
It's hilarious how they were SO sure it was gonna work they already got to work on the 2nd one
Ok that intro was funny
You cannot run from FNAF matpat
>can't give superman flight  well you kinda can, not like DC owns the copyright to the idea of a hero flying.
As long as there is just an avalanche of murdering "Wokies", it will all be approved by the majority. Eisner for the win.    - "Wokie" would be, for example, someone who would claim their dog chooses to be vegan.
This is all without mentioning the fact that almost ALL of the og Disney characters were stolen from old fairy tales and whatnot. They used the public domain to shape their image and they’ve been fighting to make it exclusively theirs ever since.
Imagine if there was a fanfic where Game Theory, Film Theory, Food Theory, and Style Theory were brothers (like they are their own people). Edit: it's official the internet is more powerful than disney.
but I wanted to hear something about this film and not copying
They should have named it "explaining copyright"
I actually went to see this  in the cinema with friends last week, it had it's moments but honestly, wouldn't visit again
Anybody notice his voice change a bit?
Can you copyright a unique variation of a public domain character? Like "Kung Fu Pooh" or "The Sane Hatter"?
Me here wondering what happened to the og intro
This is more of an explanation & history lesson than a theory. Your Food Theory channel follows the same thing. I want theories, not history. You're falsely advertising.
Hay mattpatt i didn't know if you knew or not so I was letting you know that you are a certified badass and continually make day everytime you upload
is it worth to watch?
I thought you discovered these "legal loopholes" back when you spoke about that Nemo ripoff.
The scariest thing about this video is how MatPat knew that I wasn’t wearing pants.
Theory idea how many diet coke crates do you own
You clicked on newest to see this comment didn’t you?
work at a store that sells ice cream. one of the flavors is superman. we also sell it in our package, but its called supermoo. why? DC slammed down the hammer and said no, but we managed to get one through.
that no pants joke was a little to real for me.. MAT ????
Suicide mouse now becomes a actual franchise?
Hello Matpat I have a theory for you In the movie rango there is a scene where there trapped in the water vault and I wanna know how fast does a bullet have to travel underwater for it to be able to break the glass like in the  movie. (Also I hope you're having a good day)
Is this a copyright crossover?mat was just talking about this on style
I'm glad you went through this. It's so funny seeing people who hate Disney talk about all the things they're gonna do with Mickey in the public domain and it's like... Yeah good luck with that. It's only for a very certain version of him. And, hey, they have made enough changes to him that even an artist's "version" of him could be claimed as "close enough" to their "newer" designs that they would probably still get you, ya know?
MatPat I’m very sad. Mickey is my favorite out of the main gang.😭 Now the 90 year old mouse is getting released to the public next January.😭
I thought we were done with ligma. I got it again the moment they announced a Pooh sequel
at 1:47, HOW DID YOU KNOW?! TELL ME...
At 8:00I called he was going to say welllllllllll no:not exactly lol
Hey matpat what did you think of the movie
For the first time, a YouTube video actually caught me at the perfect time without any pants on…
11:14 In this moment, you can hear Matpat trying to be possessed by Kermit the Frog
You forgot the best superman superpower, the ability to fire mini supermans at his enemies
i like how some iconic Disney characters became the antagonists like Disney's Ariel now as a villian in the upcoming dreamworks Ruby Gillman Teenage Kraken and now its Winnie the pooh's turn
so thats why my school can illegally stream disney movies
I was sitting on the toilet and mat told me I don't have my pants on how did he know
Ok so like I don’t know why but for some reason using everything that’s copyright will expire soon sounds ok with me except the hobbit unless dungeons and dragons want to use the hobbit for halflings again OTHER THAN THAT RESPECT THE WORK DON’T USE IT! Everything doesn’t rub me the wrong way to use it
#FreeMatthewPanic
Since Mickey was made a year after Oswald the Lucky rabbit does that mean his copyright expires this year
No you can't say by fans an critics especially when if critics give something a 50% an the fans give it a 4 then most of the time it's said the critics loved it but it was review bombed by mad or bigoted fans...I think fans giving it a 50 so it's actually quite liked especially compared to what Hollywood films have been getting of late...
The people at Disney are goddamn geniuses
At the end he said he wanted the nostalgia berry's but doesn't he mean the memberries lol (south park reference)
Mickey Mouse is back😍
Good theory
hopefully they all go open domain.
i have my pens on
When he said pooh was owned by me, I said really, and then he called me out bc ur right. My pants aren't on rn bc I'm taking a dumb lmao
You've said superman tm so many times that I'm dissociating. Now when I hear it, I think of Ultraman. Some kind of offbrand super guy with a generic man ending.
When pikachu is at least out in public domain that means ucapeek tiger boob pikachu is technically cannon and public domain but pickachu himself along with every pokemon is trademarked
This is honestly incredibly sad
The only thing I'm worried about when it comes to characters like Superman and Mickey entering pu kic domain is the crazy fanfiction people will bring to life about them meaning we might get more "Evil Superman" movies or portray Mickey how he is in South Park.
"Yes YOU. Sitting at home without your pants on!" Me: O_O;;
where is fnaf
What blows my mind is how did you know I was pantless. That's scary
I can't believe you didn't mention Disney has been using some old character named Oswald in tons of merch.
I'm just so mad at this movie because it could've been great 😭😭😭 the trailer had me until they revealed Pooh and Piglet and the fact that it's an exploitative slasher. Like, really??? A SLASHER?? Should've gone full monster movie, and Tigger or Owl as the secondary makes way more sense and would be scarier 😤 Piglet would've been second to go, let's be real.
I saw the mock poster for 2 Fast 2 Poohrious and instantly wanted to see Winnie The Pooh voiced by Vin Diesel and I don't even know why. Also, can everyone stop with trying to make their movies part of a "Cinematic Universe" (Just because it worked with Marvel doesn't mean that it'll work every time.)
I guess the only people allowed to milk Disney classics is Disney
Is it me or did he almost sound like Kermit the frog 11:14
You made this theory right before I finished watching it💀💀💀💀💀💀
I'll be honest, if a Mickey Mouse horror movie were to be made, it should be based on Five Nights at Treasure Island.
Disney's worst fear is them being beaten by illumination          Oh wait
"Yes you without you pants on" matpat 2023
Me as a Kid: watching Winnie the Pooh Me as an andult: watching Winnie the Pooh xD
I love the public domain ^^
... copyright of the food? Can we sue a company for making food in wrong country?
I can’t wait to see Peter Pan asking Bambi where Winnie the Pooh is so he can recruit him for the Mystical Creatures Gang
You can get Winnie’s mask it’s so funny, and it’s Steamboat Willie in the public domain.
Everyone ready for Stussyman?
Iam all for this x3 This is great.
Oh boy, I can't wait to write my $1,000 screenplay with Gandalf the Grey, Sherlock Holmes, Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Superman as they search the Earth in search of Blackbeard and his hidden treasure guarded by Smaug. Coming 2041 btw.
Poo at the beginning sounds like kronk and it's awesome. Good to the voice actor who did it!
1:51 how did he know I didn’t have them on
I saw this on soap2day I was like what tf😭
Next thing you know, Mickey Mouse will be out into the public domain, we’ll probably see a slasher dubbed “Mickey Mouse Slaughter House” or something like that.
How you know? 1:49
Is it just me or does matpat's voice sound a little different from usual?
My sister name is Winnie
5:00 it reminded me to the time when a channel wanted to Copywrite the word “react” xD
I’m afraid of stories like Alice in wonderland becoming public domain. Alice in wonderland already is and I’ve witnessed some.. questionable things.
We need to go back to copyright only being 14 years and put a time limit on trademarks.
Probably a dumb question, would someone have to pay to use the word superman instead of ubermensch in their project if they are talking about Nietzche's idea?
Took me forever to realize how the disney logo looks like a D since I started seeing it long before I could read, even still it looks more like a treble cleft than a D.
“You, yes you, sitting at home without your pants on!” *me, sitting on the toilet with my pants down* “…….”
Dear MatPat   You know the guy that you use every single video well I was thinking… What if you give him a thank you? He has been hurt, bumped, bruised, etc  and still stayed for the ride. Maybe a friend? Maybe give him a name at least. He’s always been a funny character in your videos, but he is only somewhat human. 😂  Sincerely, Me
Kim Jong Un gone crazy fr
The wennie the pooh horror movie isn't my cup of honey and tea
Thank you for helping me justify naming a character Gamboy to be an inspiration of game boy
Matpat: " Yes u sitting at home without your pants on"  Me shitting on the toilet: How the fk!
Matpat: you ! sitting there without your pants on!  Me: * really not wearing pants* oh you know me so well matpat😂
Honestly i would rather the companies keep the copyright forever than seeing iconic characters turned into murderes or something like that or idk if its possible but make a law or something stating that they could only be used as the author intended
Can’t wait to write a fanfic where Winnie the Pooh takes Steve Harvey’s place as the host of The Price is Right. And publish it officially.
16:56 bro thinks he's Mr. Beast
how did matpat no i dont have pants on
1:46 the idea of people watching film theory episodes dedicated to a horror movie without pants on scares me more then the film to be honest 😂
Imagine when power rangers goes into public domain, we will get the best f-ing psychological war movie ever
Matpat needs to do a theory about Disney's obsession with possessed children/ people
It would be cool to use 1939 batman
Would it be enough of a change to put "not made by a power hungry comperation" at the bottom of the steamboat Willy animation or just "not made by disney"? Their problem solved its not Disney done
Day 6 of asking film theory to do a theory on urbanSPOOK
In all honesty, anyone with enough time and money could argue that the spelling of a word or phrase that is a common spelling cannot be trademarked (think the word "Pink"). There is also an argument to be made that anything copyrighted cannot be trademarked and vice versa since they protect different things.
1:47 shouldn’t have been so accurate
if mickey mouse is gonna go into public domain in 2024, that means someone can make a mouse.avi movie
I Love Your Videos!!!!🥰🥰😍😍🤩🤩😄😄😎😎😎and i saw a video that miradel's gift has been stolen can you make a video about that and find the person who made a theory!!!
For those who want a non-trademarked name for mickey mouse: Mikey Mouse. You're welcome. 😂😂😂
9:49 You forget that Lois Lane was in his stories from the very beginning.
look, is the sleepy cabin
MICKEY HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG IT IS Only Rob Eiger
4:20 that's what she said
Give me basic 1938 Superman and I'll branch off from there. I dont need any of DCs baggage or continuity.
Ṡuperman
Anyone else notice matpats voice become hoarse suddenly..... U good mat
9:40 But would you be able to add more powers that he doesn’t already have? Also, does he have to be in that costume? I understand that you wouldn’t be able to use any of the already existing costumes, but would you be able to create an entirely new costume?
Disney will just spread a billion samoleons around Congress and get the copyright term extended... again... it's what they do best, game the system.
Supman
I think the first few years there will be a lot of super gory horror (and maybe some of the p word we aren't allowed to say on youtube too) specifically because Disney has had such an iron grip on a lot of characters for so long, and Disney is treated as a 'squeaky clean' studio with no sense of humor. But I also think it'll get old after a few years and stop churning out big bucks, except for super big names (like Mickey) that people are excited to see stretched to crazy limits in the public domain specifically because of that iron grip. After the 'we took these squeaky clean Disney characters and put them in a gory horror movie!' trend dies down, that's when we'll see how creative people truly get. Or don't get, if they don't feel like dealing with it. We'll see.
Not Only the Original Mickey will be in the Public Domain, people forget about the original Minnie and Pete will also too.
cancel culture is only good for corporations
LIKE AYO MICKEY ME HOMIE WHAT DID YOU DO THIS TIME NOOOOOOOOOOO
Man, I want Matpat to do a theory on Fanfic writing now ;w; rip book theory /Lh
5:15 just a random question is it also allowed to watch a video and talk over it every couple  of seconds and if it is how long do you even have to be talking over it and how much movie  can you fit between?
Super pan
9:25 we already have the spicy difficulties thing, we don't need this...    how do you trademark a color, does reddit have a trademark on orange?!
I hate the idea of random people being able to take the characters that I love and turn them into something completely different.
Hey mat pat can I copyright Winnie the Pooh so no more horror movies
Ah public domain the most useless thing now adays
not gonna lie i thought disney was gisney when i was a baby mario
Love videos like this ❤❤❤❤  This video is a good extention to a journalist youtubers called Clownfish, they talked about this multiple times. I like their videos, they talk alot about Disney but other popculture news too.
another thing that can happen when things go public is fan remasters
6:08 The Mickey Mouse Protection Act.
But wait, Winnie the Pooh was a book, not a movie first. Disney can't own it.
How do know 1:48
“Without your pants on” *me sitting on the toilet*:🫣
Why does winnie the pooh in the beginning skit sound like Joe from Family Guy
I’m just excited to finally debut my comic about a mild mannered deli owner who is secretly the Kryptonian hero “Soup Herman”
did his voice change? 11:12
I can't wait for edgy Superman movies
Hi mat and the crew! I just had and idea and i wanted to comment it so maybe you will do it one day?  have you ever listend to Melanie Martinez? I think in her songs there is secret lifetime. and after her last single all of her videos got the same saying "goodbye crybaby" i think it would have lore in it? hope i see you do this idea one day!!
I seen this to be a reclam on my tv xd
I feel called out when matpat said I don't wear pants and he would be totally right
Off the video topic of this theory and a part of a  Minecraft theory looking at the creater of disk 5 of the newest disk and I will let you make the rest of the theory matpat and have a good day :)
Any copyrighted material present in a artwork is NOT trademarkable. Done.
Simple enough to get around the superman issue, just call change the logo to an octagon with an A for average instead of an S. Call him Average man and that people got too close to connecting Klark with Superman.
Where the final theory
18 minutes for like 60 seconds of content.   This video sucks.
Honestly screw Disney. They’ve become the face of everything wrong in this country.
So how much does it take to "change someone else's idea into your own" to be legal?  I have the idea of ​​doing a manga where American and Japanese superheroes form a team to fight together, but my Captain America-style character is earth-themed, my Kamen Rider-style character is a rebellious bosozoku and so on, and that's enough  Is it original?
What is that kronk at the begining?????
25th where’s fnaf story line
how are you aware of my pantsless watchings?
9:47 wait you cant modifies things? i'm pretty sure you are wrong there because there are lots of modified public property usage
All those horrible horrible HORRIBLE 'what if Sherlock Holmes' was a vampire movies!!!' Oh wait, that didn't happen. Paranoia over the public domain is just that, paranoia.
Hi
I in fact am wearing pants
You got me. I did not have on pants… 😅
I can’t take the movie seriously   I think this should have stayed in the realm of fanfiction
1:48 I am litterally sitting without my pants on
13:08
1:47 ya didnt have to call me out like that mat...
I wouldn't mind Disney horror movies I love the idea. BUT only if they do it right and do there research. I'm 100% positive that Pooh and his friends were all stuffed animals that were alive and lived in some magical land. If thats the case then why did they make Pooh a 6 foot tall man in a suit? Maby CGI in some killer stuffed animals like Chunky did
All this is just further proof that big government and big corp are crap and need to be taken down a few pegs lol.
Anyone else think that Matt sounded like Kermit halfway through the episode
WHY AM I THE ONLY PERSON WHO THINKS THAT THE IDEA OF SLASHER HORROR MOVIES BASED ON DISNY MOVIES IS A GOOD IDEA!?! -L
With Superman, the ability to fly came later because it was easier to adapt to film/tv. Also kooks better in motion than constant jumping like a super frog of course
Oh, bother...
MatPat: you can't use Pooh as Disney made it Also MatPat: _proceeds to use it every 10 seconds in the video_
Me seeing Shazam:look Shazam!!!
You can't escape part 4
I’m pretty sure I saw something else in that intro
Disney didn't invent almost all their IP ... but they trademark it all heavily ... and have tried to extend the copyright to the absolute limit ...    Disney was embarrassed into donating to renovate the original Poohsticks bridge ... the amount they gave was estimated to be what they made from the IP in one week ...
This and style theory should have had an LEGAL EAGLE CAMEO TALKING ABOUT THE LAWS.
8:59 LIL CLOSE THERE
Public domain should not exist so long as content is still being made using the characters. Public domain is the death of lore, the end of theories. If all fanfics can be true, lore means nothing. Lore meaning nothing is the end of fandom.
Really thought terraria, underground just started playing 4:00
I honestly had to ask myself if I wanted to ruin my childhood with this one. I loved winnie growing up. But I’m also morbidly curious.
9:22 girl 😏💜
The return of sharknado type movies
Mickey Mouse should also be in the public domain but Disney can bribe senators with impunity apparently.
One political side just doesn't want pedophiles running everything and the other side is just all pedophiles. 😊
How'd you know I'm in under wear
“Well, a copyright’s meant to protect someone’s original creative work, like I explained above. A trademark is meant to protect their brand.” 11:14 Your voice sounded… slightly different. Added quickly in post?
That whistle tune from Steam Boat Willie is so iconic I find myself humming or whistling it randomly now and then, and I do so enjoy seeing those frames at the start of movies...
Oh my lord
is it just me, or does Mat Pat sound different right at @11:14? like his voice gets deeper at the ends of the words, like he's potentially sick or something? I think I noticed it in an episode or two ago and am just wondering if others notice
3:38 you known legal loopholes can fixed right
game theory idea: plz piece together the cookie run kingdom lore
I’m pretty glad this was made on my birthday
Lots of Disney source material is public domain and companies have been making cheap knockoffs for decades.  There's no harm to Disney as much as they cry about it.
mat pat never fails to get me out of my depressive rut :)
The next years are going to be crazy
I'm just waiting until a princess themed horror film.
Disney: King of Animation Illumination, DreamWorks, and Universal: Exist Disney: We need to stop these people, but how? Us: You can't.
Better to have horror adaptations of old children stories than live-action remakes.  I’d rather have a Little Mermaid movie where Ariel comes onto land to lure humans to the sea to sacrifice them to Ursula in exchange for human legs than just a cgi-filled retelling.
public domain just encourages too many hard to spot which adaptation of that character is best
Seems to me the people who make this are greedy for money and want to keep people from making good content just to keep hold of all the money it'll make, what a joke If only we had a world where anyone can make a good peace of art and not be held back my copyright and stuff like that, what a shame
If you listen carefully at 11:15 you can hear his voice profile change just a little bit
Well this video has made me hate corporations and Disney more than I already have
So, Matt just Revealed that the Next Channel, the Fourth Channel is about [Style]/Fashion?
They did that to The Banana Splits too😱
To clarify; Mickey Mouse will be in the public domain in 2024, but I believe it will only be the old version of Mickey from the vintage cartoons. The modern Mickey will remain copyrighted for now.
Film Theory: This is Disney’s WORST Fear! (Winnie the Pooh)
Honestly if anyone watched Once upon a time then they know that Peter Pan could definitely work as a horror movie. I loved that shows take on Peter Pan. Basically just do that but make it a bit darker and R rated and make Captain Hook the good guy like in once upon a time and I’m sold. That would work perfectly
I don't understand the problem, actually there can be a lot of crazy bad movies but interesting stuff made too, just like the fan mangas of Dragon Ball, there are terror histories, new transforms and "what if" that take characters like Krillin to train them and have more protagonism, with improved techniques, it can even create new jobs for a lot of people too
how did matpat know i didn’t have pants on
Let’s all pool our money together and make a shitty slasher film using your mom heard she’s in the public domain too
Only now I heard that Mat's voice became lower.
It was only a matter of time before matt went here
The Pooh slasher film pulled a GTA publicity stunt and the world fell for it.
Patrick Warburton turned into Mackey mouse is a great opening
1:48 Joke’s on you, I put on my pants *just before* you said that!
This thumbnail is terrifying. 🎉
Anyone notice the AI sound to MatPats voice?
i find copyright and trademark is stupid its literally adults being children "this is mine you cant have it or make it" sounds like a little kid, how copyright should work is just if someone makes art or something about it they just put -this is not cannon to the -_-_-_- storyline this is my spin on the story- and it gets even worse in music since if you use *a single beat* from someone elses song even if it was an accident  they can sue you, ruin your reputation, everything. the fact you can lose everything because you made a spin on someone elses creation or copied one text from someone elses work is stupid like if its good its good
Meet Superb-Man, Man of titanium coming 2033
This kind of reminds me of the Adam Ruins Everything video on Public Domain
How does he know I don't got pants on
Gonna find a way around Disney and DC out of spite.
I love learning about law
Why does winnie sound like joe swanson
I mean what about the design of Mickey before steam boat willy? Is he free game?
I actually wonder how much the logo argument would hold up in court. Yes, you wouldn’t be able to sell shirt with the Superman logo. But the character of Superman is identified buy the logo on his chest. It’s an inseparable part of his identification as that character. As long as you’re not using him in a way that directly references other copyrighted Superman media, then it would be the same as fair use to any judge worth his salt. Brands are always going to find ways to have control, that’s undeniable. But they’re not the ones making the decisions in a court room. As long as you’re being transformative with the character, I don’t think a brand can really make a cohesive argument.
1:45 Gosh darn, figures Mat would call me out for going full Pooh Bear, while watching a video featuring Pooh Bear.
I’m confused bc only the original Winnie the Pooh is public domain not the Disney version with those specific character designs
I don't like how I'm just casually using the restroom, and MatPat is like, "You yes you with your pants off." Are you spying on me, sir?!?
13:45 Hope I can start a fantasy-themed arts and crafts store and call it "Hobbit Lobby", though!
Asking for a theory of mr freeman day 8 (desk for more days)
OMG ITS THE NEWEST FILM THEROY 🎥 🎞 🎦 🎬 📽 😍  EPISODE (it's this video) https://youtu.be/fOzFG5m3Y5E
How did he know I wasn’t wearing pants
Imagine if Mickey appeared in Shrek 5
How did you know I had no pants on?
Was that Joe Swanson 0:09
I have been waiting for this movie since before Christmas 2022.
Honestly, I'd figure out a loophole around every Superman trademark out of pure spite at this point.
Nah matpat I'll just enjoy my beat that's hopped up on cocaine
Wait is this the next cinema fad that will replace super hero movies, weird adaptions of classic free domain characters?
1:47 how did you know
Finally after over a 100 years I cab see the future with a movie where batman and superman being bros while fighting the Terminator.
I have my pants on
I knew the film wouldn't be very good, it's a fun idea but if they really believed in it and knew how to execute it they would have made it years ago, because parody is free of copyright and let's be honest you don't need to wait for the rights to Pooh Bear to toy with the idea. If they really thought it was a good idea, we'd have had 'Dooh Bear' or something years ago. I don't see the point of waiting for the rights to Pooh to do something very unlike Winnie The Pooh.
Pants were uncomfy and I wanted to take them off then I hear " Yes you sitting at home without your pats on"
public domain... ok how I like to call  it... the fanfic domain
Is no one going to talk about his voice lol
His intros are better then any Hollywood movie!😂 Keep up the good work!😂🫠
I wonder how often these types of videos get copyright strikes...
Yaaaaay! I can return to my childhood but ruin it with brutal violence and murder! Just what I always wanted!😂
Sup
How did you know I'm not wearing pants😂
Disney is a capitalist WARRIOR
How did MatPat know I’m not wearing pants?😮
I don’t mind this protection.  It keeps the lowlifes from ruining the original product.  I prefer copyright and treadmark to be permanent.  If someone wants to make something of Superman (ex), they need to ask for permission, partnership, or purchase it. Simple and easy. Unnecessary human complex legal things.
You know I always wondered about how this applies to fan works
The Pooh movie only cost them around 1000 or 100k to make so 4 million or whatevs is beyond good
So instead of "game theory" knock offs, we should do "game-theory". Bet im finna make muney
Sometimes is just better to leave alone some stuff. This movie was garbage, and the idea should have never be made. Now if you take children stuff that is already creepy if you think about it like Peter Pan maybe that could work, but it's nothing creepy about Winnie the Pooh.  Shame on the producers who made this cash grab and I am scared for other characters.  And I am even more scared for the children. Imagine a child seeing this. We already got bs woke trash animation and very se**alised stuff nowadays.  I am scared of the children's innocence. And if you're gonna tell me "Oh just make sure they don't watch that stuff", back in the past we didn't need to protect and make sure our children didn't saw 9827273728 bad things! We already got the internet, we already got many more bad things. We don't need to turn beloved chlidren characters and turn them into horror. AND WE NEED MORE ORIGINAL STUFF! We are in a crisis of originality!  I am scared for the future. Not only the planet is going to s**t but humanity too. At least there are some plans to pollute less but I don't see any plans for having original stuff and humans being more kind to eachother.  :,( I hate humans. :,(
Anyone else notice the voice changing after 11:17
I doubt the kingdom hearts version of the Disney character will be available for a long time
Wish he actually talked about the movie and not the legal rights for movies since he covered this topic before but okay
My mom works for a book publishing company and they had some Disney books that they didn’t sell or they just had left overs so they were going to give the books to Africa and Disney sent them a cease and desist letter
Tbh I like the idea of this cinematic universe
Yeah, it's gonna get real weird in a few years.
0:18 myself
When he said sitting at home without your pants on I was like:  *“How do you know? HOW DO YOU KNOW? HoW dO YoU KNOOOOOWWWW?!! ”* 💀
Copyright needs to be limited  Trademark needs to be limited  Disney needs to burn
If you guys have copyright on game theory the named game theory with bomani Jones that you could go after
Hey matpat did you get my comment about that circus baby is 46 theory?
This is literally Scooby Doo all over again!
I don't see why Winnie the Pooh is their worst fear... They've already censored Star Wars to fit Chinese government ideals, and even thanks the CCP for letting them film in the same province as a Uighur concentration camp, and the Chinese market has been-- Oh! Not _THAT_ "Winnie the Pooh"...
Am I the only one who heard a slight change in how Mat sounded when he started talking about the difference between copyright and trademark? Just me? Eh, fine xD
is the steamboat willy whistle trademarked too?
4.2m>100k
Please do a theory on emesis blue matpat
Why do I feel like theirs lore to the start of all theses videos 🤔🫢
So when will Mickey be in the public domain?
god dam that was one hella of a good twist
Disney tried to sue my sons pediatrician cause he would show movies in his waiting room
i love these videos but the last 2 weeks of content has felt a little weak and i mean across all the channels WHERE IS THE LOREEEEEE
Who the heck is Willie??
How'd you know im not wearing pants?
So when's the Lilo and stitch horror movie?
I swear I saw this video about this movie on this channel two years ago
Who the heck is Willie??
What makes Superman Superman is not his powers but his character.
Back in my day I had to read fanfics to get my daily dose of hey this is my version good times you had ships,what happened after the end and what happened before it started
I found found out that my cousin's no longer have Bill Nye, instead they have Mat Pat for science class.
now more ooc matpat
Wait, how long does SpongeBob have?
Well not surprised they made it into a horror movie since Winnie the pooh is a story that has some ground in abandonment issue and depression when Donkey is literal on ur nose representation. And Christopher abandons these animals after domesticating them in the wilderness and leaving to fend em for themselves , they would be reverting to their animalistic side so don't blame if they get a bit staby😅
"Boat pilot"
ready for fnaf video yodayyyyy
Been waiting for this
Please play spiritfarer
An really funny thing about the whole IP law debacle and Disney, is that, in the Chip and Dale movie, the "original Sonic design" character appears in It....but without Sega's permission, as they didn't ask to put Sonic in, just using the legal hoophole of parody
It’s honestly upsetting that such a beautiful character is getting destroyed like this. Winnie the Pooh is my childhood and i hate to see it get ruined like this
Ah yes, the true horror experience
XD wish this came out before my exam yesterday 😂
Nope i have not seen that lame looking movie.
Do a final destination theory
Come on man, you have to fix DC's universe again after Shazam 2
1:48 I’m in the bathroom right now and that joke made me more scared than the movie did
Winnie be like: "Uhhhhh Peter, I think your babys on fire.  I'm a licensed COP but not a licensed Fire Fighter."
I think a follow up video about the specific role that parody plays in copyright law. A massive part of how people are able to get away with using copyrighted works and ideas without their creators’ consent is with the art of parody, and I was surprised that it didn’t appear in this video. I’d love to see MatPat cover it sometime either as a sequel to this video or as it’s own theory.
Am I the only one who thinks the Winnie the poo in the horror movie, looks like friendo from life of luxury, “We went to Petty’s Playhouse.”
Day 5 of asking matpat to do a dreams of an insomniac video
even tho this was made an hour ago I love it no matter how early 🫡
this movie was terrifying, not because its scary, but because its a terrible movie
Disney is already doing a horror remake of little mermaid.
do u know what i want i want a cocomelon correct timeline
Please do a theory on copyrighting colors
Please do a theory on copyrighting colors
I actually have no pants on…
I DONT CARE ABOUT DISNEY BEAR I WANT FNAF STORY THAT HAVE A REAL BEAR
LET'SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Are we getting law and copyright week like cannabilism and kfc week 😮
Did anyone else hear the sudden Kermit voice at 11:17 or was that just me?
i love tigger
hey matpat just a quick aside, since you kept bringing up Superman being a horror villan. It already happened, years ago. Brightburn.
HOW DID YOU KNOW I DIDN'T HAVE MY PANTS ON???????????
they can make evil pooh but not evil  tigger
Can you do a film theory on how an amazing film like Triangle (2009) got such a low box office compare to a movie like this?
A UK bin cleaning company got forced to change their name because their name was "one ring to clean them all" and it was too close to lord of the rings, "one ring to rule them all." So trademarks are super hard to get past and honestly I thought their name was quite funny and creative.
More like thaiwans worst nightmare😂
Mat posts this video 20 minutes later (knocking on the door) Mickey stands looming over him and says “ha-ha, get him boys”
Can’t wait for someone to make Pooh vs Sherlock Holmes.
Could you do a theory on “Providingforthwcommuinty”
Dang, mat didn't mention Charles. I feel that him mentioning this movie and proceeding to watch it probably is what got it so much of its money. Also, with such a tiny budget, it was bound to make money.
You should copy right your own logo
I haven’t watched the video so far so I just want to advise you to NOT ruin the one thing that raised me better than my parents
I can see the ad marketing for a mouse taking over a ship and as they keep sailing out more fog emerges. To the end of the venture on the coastline with an empty boat and "the whistling mouse" coming theoretically to you.
Keeping in mind that it was low budget I take the poor reviews of it with a grain of salt  And it seems like the people trashing this film weren’t expecting a low budget movie in theaters and oddly enough it is one of the better low budget movies we’ve gotten in theaters in recent years not the best, but definitely not bad at all    It’s a solid movie that should deserve a passing grade.
YESS, i always wanted to watch this
"Mickey Mouse will be public domain in 2024" -If you actually believe that date won't get pushed back once again, I have some ocean front property in Arizona to sell you.
I knew matpat would see the art ahead
i know call him mikey the mouse
I will never get tired of Ryder's voice impressions in videos
While I, for one, welcome our new twisted horror Disney overlords
HOW DID HE KNOW I DIDN'T HAVE PANTS ON!!!!
How did he call that I hade no pants
I actually didnt have my pants on lol im scared
So essentially trademarking is like claiming usernames for an online game, and anybody who wants a similar name has to add hyphens and numbers to bypass it.
Now I'm ready for companies to start welding Thompsons With the copyright logo on it
Sounds like someone needs to call a legal eagle, or maybe I should say the legal eagle?
Is it just me or does Mat sound sick?
Why does MatPats voice sound so different here? 11:15
Let’s see… Super-man Soup-er-man Sooperman  Souperman Supermahn  Shuperman Shooperman  I’m ready! Edit: I forgot the best one SUPRAMAN
Disney is literally the definition of lawful evil
And the worst part is that a sequel has been greenlit: Well, one of the worst things.
May Pat did u know that 666 is in Disney
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT I'M IN THE BATROOM?!?!?
May pat should do a theory on one piece
The fact he called out that I don't have pants on💀
Bro at the start when MatPat said “no please no” the lights in my house flickered
wait, lobbying is paying people for votes? shouldn't that be illegal or am I too european to understand that
MARVEL IS DOING THE SAME THING AS DISNEY¡!!!!!!!!!!!! EVERY TIME THEY ADD A NEW CHARACTER IT GOES INTO THE TITLE SEQUENCE PF MARVEL AT THE START OF MOVIES AND SHOWS
A Peter Pan horror movie would work so well. Just make him a serial killer in London and make Hook a cop trying to stop him from sending more children to "neverland"
1:46 im literally watching this after taking a shower how did he know
Bro really called out my lack of pants
Is it just me or does his voice keeps on changing? It could be just me tho
I dont think anyone should be allowed no matter how long it takes to use others creations no matter what. Idc if you can make it better or whatever it aint yours.
It would not surprise me if Disney shadowfunded this movie so that Disney can go to the government and say "Look, they're making up look bad with these horrible movies! Pwease extend the domain laws indefinitely!"
I saw a yellow bear and thought this was part 3 of fnaf timeline....disney? sure.
Bro really called me out at 1:48
Disney: I Will always Win...
I thought they already ripped Superman with Brightburn. Just saying tho.
Man, trademarks are really limiting us. One day, even SOUP will be trademarked.
CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN
This reminded me of when the React channel tried to copyright the idea of reaction videos
so with disneys steamboat willie logo, is that why marvels logo is the marvel lettering with all the comic strips in it in that animation? to cover all the old comics within the IP?
but disney own the other three so yah this will not work  disney owns some much is is easyer to sy what thy own than what thy do not own .
I went over these copyright issues during my education training, and thankfully the general upshot for teachers is that educators have wide latitude to use copyrighted material with proper credit.
I do have pants on though.
The real win here is not making something new out of it. It is just using the name somewhere. Instead of using legally distinct Ricky the Rat in your movie, game or whatever, we we actually get mentions of Mickey Mouse instead of getting the honestly annoying legal word tango.
Aka we are screwed anyway, goddammit trademark!!!
I wonder if that whistle thing will hold up in a court case. Will it be found to be maliciously trying to subvert copyright law?
Could you export all your videos in 21:9, thanks
In the begin Pooh sounds like crunk form the emperor’s new groove😂
I swear to god his voice sounds more nasally and deep.. does anyone else hear it???
aw but sitting without pants is nice :(
Honestly, the film was kinda disappointing
You know I think it's funny that even film theory doesn't feel the need to point out that Disney is evil with the theory.
When I first heard about this Winnie the Pooh horror movie, I thought this was gonna be a creepypasta movie, and my friend joked that this evil Pooh was another byproduct of *Z@[_G○.* THAT would've made more sense.
Wait, Mickey isn't shirtless!?
1:47 HOW DID YOU KNOW I DIDNT HAVE MY PANTS ON?
JOKES ON YOU MATPAT! I am wearing pants
When he said “Yes you! Without your pants on.” I freaked out cause I was using the bathroom
The thing is that disney won anyway. It's not the original book. It's still Disney's Pooh bear. The slasher still has a yellow bear mask and red shirt. It got its tickets by using Disney's design!
Someone also made a grinch horror movie
Eddsworld
question, is The Incredible SuperMan TradeMarked
Hey look its Xi Jingping
I feel like you should have added the Banana Splits movie as an example. The copyright was lost a few years ago and SYFY made a horror movie out of it that’s literally just like Willie’s Wonderland.
Why was the start so funny though? 😂
hey matpat can do a theory on the fall out boy lore.
okay but hear me out: a mickey origin story movie, it starts with mickey meeting donald when he worked for Smelly pete and goes on with him meeting goofy and his friends. Id pay to see that if its done right
Will we get this movies theory?
Everyone get ready for my Silmarillion knock off show in 2043 called "Complicated Elf Story".
All this legal stuff is actually rlly interesting😂😂
why did you have to call me out for not wearing pants MatPat??
Dude that'd be awesome ideal for a movie a cartoon mouse that drag people into puddles of ink and works of art and murder them leaving They're dead victims as a piece of art on display.
Abolish Copyright.  _Copying is not theft_ _Stealing a thing leaves on less left_ _Copying, it makes one thing more_ _that's what's copying's for._
You should do a video the ken penders lawsuit it’s very similar to this
Fnaf episode was supposed to come out today but i hope it comes  out soon
We NEED a 2 fast 2 poohrious and Avatar the way of Pooh!!!!!
i thought there would be a jump scare at the beginning  great video mat pat
.superman Superman. Superman! Superman                                                          .
I took a Winnie this morning and, it was stinky lol
Nice to see barbie’s logo In this video because I love her 💖💗💕
As an animation student, it's great to see this taught in a simpler way, really helps you understand everything in a fun and funny way  Thanks for helping me remember stuff for my finals
Don't worry, Congress SUDDENLY gets interested in copyright law right around the time Mickey Mouse is about to go public. Congress was TOTALLY INTERESTED in updating that RIGHT at that particular time.  Any "congresspeople" with some "aNtI-wOkE" vengeance against Disney will go REAL QUIET towards the end of this year. I promise you that.
matpat made a theory on xi jinping, no way
This is china's worst enemy
i think you mean the Chinese presidents worse nightmare
While I didn't know about the Dinsey angle,  the concept is not new. Anyone remember "Pride, Prejudice,  and Zombies" from years ago?
wait a minute how do you know I was pooping with my pants off
7:17: DID SOMEBODY SAY THE DOOR TO DARKNESS!?!?!?!?
Question is, is it better than cocaine bear? Ha ha!
Matt... How did you know I wasn't wearing pants
This universe should unironicly replace the MCU
I'm kind of proud of myself for knowing a decent chunk of this already. I found out some stuff a couple years ago when looking into the old Captain Marvel debacle.
Nostalgia berries. I see what you did there.
Fun fact! Christopher Robin (the actual son of the Winnie-the-Pooh creator) absolutely despised the whole franchise, because he was mocked for it his entire childhood.
الشعب يريد حلقتين اسبوعيآ مين بيتفق معي
Next year will be mickey so in reality disney worst fear is the puplic domain law
i mean whats worst movies that are made by Disney that are bland or just over used or movies that really terrible and just waste your time
How'd you know I have no pants on, good sir?
You always portray large companies as evil/manipulative.. and maybe that's true for other things but in this case, I agree with Disney trying to protect its characters from the public domain because after all, they're their creations, so they should be owned by Disney. If I made an original character, I wouldn't want other people to ever take that character for themselves.
Can you make a video on mr freeman?
The fact that they can go after fan works is so upsetting. Frickin sucks, man.
I can't decide if it's right or wrong.
Why does whiney the pooh sound like kronk from the emperors new grove
Seems the only way to take down Disney now is to actually take them down. Like, physically. With tanks and things.
He hasn’t seen the mean one then. The grinch horror movie yet lol I actually like these it’s like some are good like the mean one. But they’re sorta bad and good movies to enjoy
All these legal and copyright issues get pretty murky when it comes to music as well, especially classical music. Most classical music is fair game. If a piece of music was published before I believe 1927, you can perform it, remix it, write an arrangement of it, and anything else with no problem. For example, the New York Philharmonic can play Beethoven’s 5th symphony without needing permission or needing to pay royalties to the composer or publisher. They can also decide to record that performance of Beethoven’s 5th and then release it to sell or stream. However, it’s not possible to use that recording in a movie, online video, commercial, etc. unless you have express permission or pay royalties to the New York Philharmonic. This is because they technically own the recording, not the actual piece that was recorded.
Bro you are my worst fear how did you know I’m sitting at home wit no pants on?
Where’s the timeline!
im suprised he didnt talk about all the pinokio films and games that came/coming out
Hey! Film theory can you tell me if I can use the steam boat Willy mickey design in a horror movie or video game because I can’t find any information sorry.
Steamboat Willie was a copyright stolen from the previous year’s film Steamboat Bill Jr, which in turn was stolen from the previous year’s hit song Steamboat Bill. Disney should have no right defending any Mickey  copyright.
The irony of Disney using the Public Domain to make the bulk of its classic movies, and now when its THEIR turn to be Public Domain, they call in sick.
This why I've refused to purchase ANY Disney products in the last 40 years.  US copyright  should be reduced by half.
1:48 “yes you sitting at home with no pants on MATT PAT HOW DID YOU KNOW?!? THATS THE SCARIEST PART PF THIS
Call me crazy, and off topic, irrelevant, whatever, but it did not sound to me like matt patt fully narrate this episode. Like I noticed it between 11:30 through 12:30 . If I’m wrong so it be it. If Matt was sick and his voice changed during different take of this episode, so be it. I’m cool with that. But I think Matt patt had help. Which is fine. And also nessary. 5 channels vids every week it feels like. That’s a lot of work. Get the help you need.
There are gonna be people who look at the thumbnail, assume it was mocked up for this video, and then learn it's from a real movie.
We need more movie knockoffs and toy knockoffs happen all the time
I always come out of a theorist video feeling so much smarter 😅
This is actually the second movie from this company this first is the grinch horror film "the mean one" it's actually really good
i watched this and it was actually decent. the plot needs to be upgraded... but the cinematic shots and stuff is pretty good.
I actually like the concept of horror Disney movies.  It a good change from the normal narrative. I actually want to see a rollie pollie Ollie horror movie
Good and solid episode discussion.  You may want to do a follow up on Batman though, who himself could be a video.  He started as a gun-wielding vigilante.   So when Batman with his extra long ears, hits the public domain, people can ONLY have him as a gun-toting vigilante.  The No-Gun rule only started about 3 years into his comic books, in Batman issue #4.
1:48 HOW TF DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT WITH MY PANTS ON???????
E
So, I may or may not have a list of public domain horror stories for classical stories that Disney used. So, yeah, eventually we're going to get a bunch of very well written horror stories for classical literature.
didn't you already do the how and why low budget horror movies get made in the one about video game movies? I can't see it much of a difference.
The caew in poppy playtime
MatPat we need an episode on the Ranboo analog horror series generation loss
I wish u watch anime so u could make a theory about the One Piece.....in case ur actually intrested i hope u read the manga instead tho cuz the anime is too slow
Can't wait for their loopholes and string-pulling to run out, when the mouse is fair game it's gonna be a hoot.
I think that we already had something like that with youtube, although that was never high budget productions, I mean there is a video of goofy hitting cell from fragon ball with a mallet while he laughs, kind of funny considering the situation.
No its not getting paid
Has "$uperman" come out yet?
I did not see the video in my recomended. I got it from style theory. do you think thaaaaaaaat idk THE THUMBNAIL might JUST MIGHT, beee toooo. . . "explicit"  I mean we are in the modern youtube, with a new CEO sooooooo idk
I'm taking a Photoshop class this year in high school and we had to learn all about copyright laws when it comes to images and...ya, it is super confusing
DDLC Theory
I was pooping and then I heard matt say "It belongs to you, you sitting at home with your pants off" THE WHAT?!?
that film was actually pretty good though
Matpat Ya you sitting at home without your pants on me watching this video after bath before putting clothes on. My brain: he spying on you🤯
1:48  I feel personally attacked
🥸
Gangsta till Roblox is old enough to be thrown into the Public Domain
Week 65 of asking for a spooky month theory.
Disney is personally responsible for lobbying to get copyrights extended so long😂😂 and that’s not a theory
E
Personally, I'm not a fan of patents, copyright, and other various "protections". Most of them have too much time to be ethical. At most something should really be protected at like a decade. Certain things should NEVER be protected, like medications, looking at you insulin.
3.8 or thirty point eight?
NGL I'm really angry at the people that made this. It completely ruins our childhood memories. Very sad 😔.
Steamboat Willie : The Sea Shore Slasher
Thanks for excluding Alaska from the U.S
This movie is sooooooooooooooo boring. With a theme like "cannibal winnie the pooh" one would think it's crazy and schlocky, but it's just so fkng boring!
Day 2? I think of asking for poochee and pansy
This was made 59 minutes ago not a hour!😊
Hey Matt Pat, can you do a game theory of slime rancher of the plort being there babies
middle earth enterprises tried to sue a company called 'lord of the bins', they clean bins... poor guys just tryna clean some bins for peeps ;-; but anyways i dont think it went through so idk, try googling it
7:36 when did this happen?
1:00 *I wouldn’t call a 50% audience score “absolutely eviscerated“.*
No offense matpat but for a bit, you sounded like Kermit
Lmao we just make mickey an anime boy instead
Legal loopholes also existed with the mean one, a horror adaptation of how the Grinch stole Christmas. The character was simply never referred to as "the Grinch, whoville was named "newville", Cindy loohoo was named "Cindy you know who" among many other examples. And that film was still made much before the Grinch came to public domain.
Now you have me curious. Can you do a theory on the premise of fanfictions, fan art and the off shoots of it. After all there is over 6 million marvel fictions on ao3 and people do make/spend movie on these by way of creating short films, fanart for and audio books of these fanfictions
Wait sure Winnie-the-Pooh is kinda a odd character of the bunch for Disney considering that people know Disney's Adaptation of the character and his friends but from what I thought I understood how Copyright worked was that they have to use the character in official media so they won't lose the copyright. Look at what is happening with Marvel and DC with the whole Captain Marvel debacle. Marvel has to keep making comics with Captain Marvel's name or risk losing the right to call the character Captain Marvel in the title series and DC swooping in and taking back the copyright of the name and beginning to title (which BTW is the original Captain Marvel) Shazam back to Captain Marvel and I'm pretty sure Marvel doesn't want that to happen. My point is with Mickey Mouse as long as Disney is continuing to use the character they won't lose the copyright or trademark of the character it's impossible.
Bro Mat pat said yea you with your pants off my pants were literally off I actually scared me so bad I am so slow sometimes 😂
i've been waiting to hear matpat's ideas on this movie. very yummy :]
Props to Mat and the team for bringing such engrossing theories
1:48 how does he know?
If Sherlock entered the public domain, does that mean that we're gonna see Sherlock making the murders he has to solve the next day? Wait, I meant this as a joke but it actually sounds like a phenonimal psychologic horror movie!
Disney busy destroying their own characters
Goofy a-  bear
How’d you know I didn’t have pants on? 1:49
Is Oswald the Lucky rabbit public domain?
Hi
Not to be weird or anything but how did you know I wasn’t wearing pants
In the case of Christopher Robin, since he was a real person, wouldn't his estate protect him from being used in disgusting schlock like Horror Pooh?
There's a bill being spearheaded by Josh Hawley and if it passed Under the proposed bill, the new copyright term would be reduced to 28 years, with the option for an additional 28-year extension. After the maximum 56-year term expires, the work would enter the public domain.
Dude, I was literally using the bathroom watching this, then came 1:47.
Superman becomes “supes vs mrbat” and his crest is SM now XD
Mat, PLEASE i’m begging you, do a theory about a channel called “providing for the community”. It has tons of lab grown fruits and a lab grown ear! Its weird and gross and i feel like a science episode would be super cool to see if a living banana is a real thing!
Basically, a trademark is a stronger version of copyright. As long as you have the trademark, you do not have to worry about copyrights.
Wait, they're doing a Peter Pan one? That one isn't even public domain. Nor does Disney own it, actually. It belongs to a children's hospital.
you are actually wrong about one thing matt. Micky is already in public domain. Well atleast the steamboat micky version is it entered in 2018
how...how did you know? how did you know that i am not wearing any pants?????
If you're going to dig down into the business workings of low budget horror movie production, please hook up with Cecil from Good Bad Flicks here on YouTube. That is his bread and butter!
Oh jeez I'm only five seconds in. And I know exactly what this is. The whole Mickey Mouse protection act among Disney's other franchises. I know this is the year it's supposed to end but it'll probably take me a while to get around to this because I'm honestly kinda tired of the debate right now.
at the 11:17 mark why did matpat suddenly get possessed by kermit for a little bit
'Yes you with out your pants on ' me getting dressed and not wearing pants yet 'how the frick do you know that
What about Oswald the Lucky rabbit is he already in the public?
The flight ability premiered in the public domain Fleischer toons.
Matpat you are wrong I have pants on
Um MatPat, I think your turning into Kermit the frog.
ive heard that people are sending death threats to the people who made this crap and i dont blame them and we thought velma was bad
When I first heard of this movie the first thought that appeared in my head was all those creepy pasta over the years about the gang in 100 Acre Woods going feral when Christopher isn't there to feed them anymore, pretty sure many of them had Eeyore being eaten too.
Tat him up!
You know what, for less than $100,000, the cinematography is pretty good.  Anyway, I'm off to write a psychological horror about Tigger having to come to terms with the fact that if ONE LETTER WAS DIFFERENT.................  His name could've been Digger and tiggers don't dig.
I used to work at The Magic Kingdom of Walt Disney World in Florida. There is a "library" that employees could use on property. The facility used to play various Disney film on VHS and DVD. Then one day, the facility was ordered to stop playing the movies. WHY...??? The DVDs and VHS cassettes were "licensed for home viewing." 🤦 Disney corporate ordered the stoppage of Disney movies playing on Disney property to Disney employees because of fine print. WAZUPWITDAT!?  It's not like Disney was going to sue itself. 😂
Man, if I had a nickel for every time MatPat got kidnapped and tied up, I'd have two nickels... Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice, right?
I already knew it belongs to me, but how did you know I wasn't wearing pants.
my favourite youtuber since 2019
Am I the only one who thinks that when Mickey becomes public domain, they’ll pull the horror film twist, but more along the lines of an adaptation? They have some heavy hitters to base it off of if you agree with me.
Can u do a therory on pennywise and the killer clowns from outer space
well if trademarks are gone if the company goes bankrupt we might have a chance to use mickey with how disney is these days
Fun fact Tigger is going to be in the sequel
My only conflict with this theory is that you think any conservatives will stand by what they’ve said about Disney. Write them a big enough check and they will forget what they said.
Sup
Hello
Im glad FINALLY someone addressed the D in Disney, forever as i kid i was confused because i thought it was a G lol
it is almost as if there are laws protecting people who have enough money to buy the work of authors after their deaths against people with less money
Can you make a Learning With Pibby Theory please I want to hear want you say
Interesting
I was changing while watching this video and I was taking my pj's off and at the same moment he said "yes you with your pants off"
I know for a fact there is a group of authors just WAITING to be able to sell their spicy John/Sherlock fanfic for profit
How did he know that I don't have my pants on? 😂
My ultimate question : Is it MatPat who voices Mickey Mouse....?
How come Mat's voice changes at 11:14?
This movie sucked
While I am not a copy or trademark attorney, I did take copyright in law school and asked my professor this exact question and this"theory" is pretty close to what he described.
Why out of all of them why Winnie the Pooh first
So who knew some of this already thanks to Adam ruins everything
Sup-r-man the hero that is blue red and can jump really high!!! Buy a comic today!
On the bright side, legislation may catch up, people may not really want to profit from those overused unoriginal BS, it's not going to be worse than fair use, and people will come up with exhaustive summaries and guides on how to safely use those public domain IPs...
Where's Freddy?
i would have been on board if we had an actually winne the pooh teddy bear running around with an axe and not a man in a pooh bear costume.
It's not addressed in this video, but are trademarks international? They specified copyright but not the other.
"Huzzah " - spurrit
you can't copywrite idea's witch is why epic game put dances from tv shows like fresh prince and scrubs into fortnite and if epic games wanted too thay could release a horror themed season and battle pass witch rip off versions of jason freddy kruger and any fnaf character
Why Pooh tho...?
1:45 how'd he know I'm pants less?
Doesn't surprise me that Peter Pan is one of the ones next up to become a horror movie, depending on how you look at the original work it practically is close to being one already and probably would require surprisingly little adjustment to become full-on horror. Peter Pan just as an individual is just creepy.
If the winnie the pooh directors make a Peter pan movie, i swear they need a captain hook protagonist
this movie was so bad we had to watch it in 2x speed. at least it became funny.
I feel like this movie is like the 2019 Child’s Play remake all over again
Oh yes, the true horror: Corporate greed
I watch this and since I like fnaf it didn’t scare me one
Yes he finally listened to my comment
Copyright law won't stop people who make fanfiction
And the Shrek universe
🤨 did Mat's voice sound weird around 11 minutes in to anyone else?
NO GOD PLEASE NO NO NOOOOOOOOOO
How did Mat know I don't have pants on
Honestly, Copyright freaking sucks now. 120 years of companies taking a dump on the smaller guy. And the smaller guys never being able to watch their works continue/grow.  Disney ruined stories being able to change and be molded. "But people will make profit off shitty works-" so what? Disney themselves are making a profit off their own shitty works. People should be able to do whatever they want with characters that are put into the creative table.  We could have, like, an epic story made by Jane Johnson about Mickey and the gang, or a tear jerker in the realm of Harry Potter. But corporations are gonna copyright strike you for your art, your music, your writing, and get the profits from your work because you used their character in their 120 year copyright life.
Don't do superman! Do Superman!!
Why did Winnie sound like Joe Swanson from Family guy.
I didn’t watch it it’s because you seemed too scary besides he is my favorite character
Thank lobbyists for the fact corporations refuse to let go of characters since when it comes to laws within the US literally Money talks.
Was that Patrick Warburton?
Love your videos!
1:46 this was a personal attack
Disney needs to change the laws to copyright lasts 5 years without a product released using it which would open most things to the public while keeping what they care about out of the public ( I haven't watched yet)
HEY. ITS THE 25th !?!?!’
Fun fact about Superman and avoiding the trademark when he enters the public domain: a "Super-Man" already exists in DC comics, the Super-Man of China, Kong Kenan. (Yes, there's a canonical Chinese knockoff Superman, and his comic run was excellent.) So adding a hyphen won't save you in that case.
1:48 HOW DID YOU KNOWWWWWW, I FEEL SO VIOLATED
I swear matpat can literally make a simple children show into some horror plot and if he did, we wouldn’t be surprised
My theory for Winnie 2, spoilers like a lot - imagine if everyone like out castes tiger for being to much. To ruff with them to, and when he finds Christopher robin, it’s actually whinnie that comes to save him causing him to die and him forgiving Christopher. Like a fight between whinnie and tiger would kinda be fire with how they did the fight scenes.
in a section of the video matpat's voice changed
Hey uh matpat?you ok or Feel you sick because your voice sounds...well it just doesn't sound right are you okay my man?
I guess this is why Marvel and DC both redesigned their cinematic logos to include still images of their most popular super heroes taken strait from the comics... this is pretty clever!
After I subscribed to all of matpats channels I realized that he posts them all at the same time
man this was moderately depressing lmao
Makes sense! Disney is afraid of the Winnie the pooh horror movie because it will ruin both the Disney/Winnie-the-Pooh franchise since their both for kids!
Seeing Mickey as a recurring character on matt patt's theory videos gives me ptsd as a former employee lololo
so, here's a fair solution, make your own characters.
Learning about copyright laws is a fun concept when Matpat talks about it
When MatPat says "loyal theorists" , realy gives you one of the feelings of all time.
Hi The Film Theorists I love this and I hope you have a good day and you are awesome and funny
So this is great. Have you ever looked into the Battletech IP and the copywrite nightmare that has torn that IP apart? It is a MASSIVE cluster of epic proportions. I think it would be up your alley.
Hi
Jeez why am I early I hate being early
please dont ever call halflings hobbits again...
I've never more called out in a YouTube video then at 1:48
Inb4 "Whiney the Pooh." with a blue shirt, and such knockoffs, lol Mackie Maus and Schteamboard William Supperman, the man of feels The Habits of Isengard Etc. that way you can skirt around trademarks way easier, while basing on the public content, so you're free to sell your Mackie Maus toothpaste if you want ;)
By the way. The term middle earth is technically useable. This term is from norse myth. and in the old norse way of writing the word, you saw the term plenty of times: Midgard.
pog
I'm literally not wearing pants. When I tell you I was shook when he made that comment 💀
hi
This is just cool
e
Possibly trademark laws conflict with copyright laws?
Mickey Mouse is worse
Why are they making this XD
Am I the only one who noticed mat’s voice changed a little bit 11:15
but why though?
«You, sitting at home without your pants on»  How did he know I was on the toilet?
...so... how did Brightburn get made?
he sounds different
12:51 Superman? Nah, this is my original character, Superiorman.
Oh, okay.
Lol the 1006 Prototype cameo 😂
What's funny was despite better judgment I went to see the movie and literally what I had gotten from Charlie's quick rundown was far scarier in my head than the actual movie was
half of the video mat pat sounds like Kermit the frog
fun fact Cher's ex-husband was the one who got the special Mickey Mouse copyright law through the house
day 2 of asking matpat to make a theory on bill nye because of lore I found in one episode
The whole trademark thing reminds me of Jirard The Completionist and his battles with it. Specifically the 'defend it or lose it' bit as he talked about how sometimes it really sucks going after otherwise minor things that break trademark because if he didn't he could lose his claim to it.
Is Popeye a superhero?
Mat pat sounds like an AI
Guys I am going to make a movie. It's gonna be called Winnie the Pooh Vs King Kong
People will give it a try anyway. Prepare for su*per*man
1:48 how did he know!!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah disney will just do what it has before and buy off congress to push that date back another 10 years
I swear i saw this video before
How did he know... i wasent in pants
Don't know if you'll see this mat pat but I think you'd be intrigued at this new arg called welcome home, if it were a creepy pasta it'd  be crystal cove, it has a similar vibe to hello puppets and it's still ongoing
Film Theory of the Bee movie: Can bees actually carry a plane, and if so, how many does it take?
Excuse you? I have my pants on.
Wow...  (Or should I say, "Wow, wow, wow... wow")
Did you really have to make a silhouette of pyros stock flamethrower at 6:58?
3:30 PROTOTYPE!
*mat pat calling out my lack of pants* "Ha! Your 8 minutes too late! I already got dressed!"
what happened to Matt's voice at 11:15? Did you use some AI voice or something?
Thanks MatPat, I’ve now learned more about copyright from this 18 minute video on a knock off Winnie the Pooh then from my Media and Ethics class in college
Do a theory on South Park please I’ve waited forever for one.
Want do "the theory 360"
1:47 actually I have a pants on, but I'm sitting here shirtless
Okay but hear me out, what if someone made a Super-Man horror movie with all his original powers and his suit ripped up or something so the symbol is just a giant hole. I think seeing him leap over a building, crushing a small child under his feet when he lands and causing cracks in the earth, before ripping someone's head off or something is way more terrifying than heat vision. Then maybe he can use his super speed to reverse the earth like Flash did and we see him back in a time when he was adored by the public, get bored of it all, and does it all again. I mean legally we could probably do it, right?
I swear one day nitendo is gonna sue disney for Mickey having an m in his name like mario
I'm actually curious about the Steamboat Willie hypothetical Matpat poses at the end of the video. Could you keep the concept relatively the same (i.e. "a mouse steering a boat while whistling a tune") but change the SONG he is whistling? Or would that still fall under the Disney trademark?
2:33 WHAT HOBBIT ? how  ? "Tollkeen Estate is know for strong protection of Tolkeens work
44min nice
I am just appalled by them trying to make a lovable character a murderous psychopath! If they want a masked killer stalking teens in the woods, go make a Voorhees movie!
when he said that i have no pants on he was shockingly correct
Nice
I love how you portray Mickey Mouse like he is in South Park
I thought it was literally a theory of the movie, but I instead got the copyright and trademark explanation
great vid!! youre an expert lol
Hard to believe it,when an international corporation is actually right-minus everything they say and do,of course,bruh,actually...
I'm learning more from Mat Pat than I have in high school
Michael Rat in Steamship William
Stephen Colbert is counting the hours, until *The Hobbit* is public domain.
Oh no legal loopholes.
You should try to do an Autodale theory.
You need to explain to the copyrigth law in japan and how does netflix get it to ruin anime
There is a Grinch slasher flick too.
i...why just why...
Soon in the best Chinese Cinemas
They are super cool film  Theory forever
Foafy voicing the evil Disney characters never gets old
what abaout fnaf??? :(
Tom nook is here
WHEN HE SAID "YOU AT HOME WITHOUT YOUR PANTS ON," I GASPED
"yes you sittin' at home without your pants on,"    i feel called out
I saw the movie. I thought it was fine. My best friend loved it.
The new Winnie the Pooh not only looks like, but also sounds like the current Philippine president in this video   Move over, Xi Jinping
Yeahhhhhhhhhh
Nice
In the next 5 secs, there will be 3k comments, watch
Claim your before a hour ticket here:
You can use mine mouse she's in the same cartoon and they aren't using her
You'd better delete this and replace it with Toy Story 5 prediction. Remember what you said in your last toy story video that disney Pushed you too far that's what you did. Do you really think they'll get away with it? Of course? They won't so make a theory? On Toy Story 5 and the other  stuff they announced. Like inside out two or whatever And you're better not do the timeline video and do piggy instead cause. I've been waiting for you to do that and you basically scammed us of piggy. You said you were going to do Peggy yet you never came back so you better do it? You don't want people to think you're a criminal or a scam no do we Or maybe you were just trolling your audience and just scamming them with ridiculous knowledge so you could manipulate people and bend them to your will or something
The little mermaid: Ursula's revenge.  Ursula, the evil witch has managed to push her way back from the other side, & she is ready for the revenge.
This is one of my favorite theroy   Also please smg4 it’s is so worth it
Is it just me or the original Superman feels like a very good concept to write stories once he's on public domain? 2033 can't wait
I like the movie it was pretty alright
Xi jinping loves honey
The fact I’m 11 and still understand what he says
It really is crazy how much mega corporations dictate our lives these days. When you look back, they've been chipping away and taking our rights for the better part of the past century at minimum. Great analysis and theory!
How do you know
6:58 Pyro wants there flamefrower.
Great video like every other video by matpat great job matpat and his editors :)
A NEW VIDO AND IM SRUPRIED
Proportion Productions and Jagged Edge Productions are also responsible for making horrors based on Humpty Dumpty and Jack and Jill - now free to watch on YouTube.  I'm quite surprised how far they've come. I love terrible movies and I've been following them for a while. The quality of the movies are not the best but from what I've seen on their social media, the cast and crew seem to always have a blast making these movies.  EDIT: PP also work on movies directed by Louisa Warren - who owns ChampDog Films. PP have a sister company called Strain Pictures and currently have a short movie on YouTube called Burnt
2Fast 2Poohrious would probably be a good time.
Bro I’m waiting for the fourth part of the FNAF timeline that’s supposed to come out today
On topic of general ideas: Courts look at the number of similarities and how they might be explained. Yes. a child befriending a teddy is not protected. But the more ideas you take from the original, the more "suspicious" you get. Best example is the Glorious 7 which took nearly the whole plot from the 7 Samurai and just changed the setting. Kurosawa sued and won. Star Wars also took plenty of plot eleents from Kurosawa but mixed it with plenty other sources. They did not get in trouble. This is one big reason why this Tarantino remix style is legal.
Is it just me or Mat sounds kinda weird in this one?
Hey...I'm wearing my pants.
why dont they have superman running as fast as a train or jumping over a building in any of his movies ? legit what he is known for in the comics ..idk how if hasnt been translated to the screen
How did u know i didnt have pants on
6:43 Never underestimate the power of money.
This is far better than what Disney do now.
Here’s an interesting question, how loud do you have to yell to produce the same amount of power as goku
Early
patrick warburton?
Hey now... I'm gonna put pants on eventually 😅
Ah yes, i love it when companies monopolize characters and ruin our childhood
Never thought i d get a whole life tutorial on trademarks/copyright
,,Avatar:the way of Pooh" I cant💀
I can see why companies would like that trade mark of color and smell for certain things because that playdoh smell is iconic and that color of Barbie is one to one, so that’s the most I’d ever defend a company because it would literally be trying to pull in people for certain things.
Look how they massacred my boy
Another amazing theory from that theorist squad, actually though how do they think of this stuff.
mat
Please Matt please spare my family please I made you the poop theory’s. PLEASE … My family my baby brother he was only 10 months old, why? WHY!!!!!!
Me to
I gotta be honest, I'm not even mad at Disney here. Of course they want to protect their mascot, it doesn't get more Disney than Mickey Mouse, they are still making new content with him in Comics and Animation, taking him away and making him public because of some time limit would just be weird to me.
pls i need to know the stream time for the fnaf timeline
Where's the FNAF part 4 time line vidio it's the 25th
you know i saw your face in a ad for some crypto scam (it was using gtlive footage) just thought you might want to know
Love you film theory ❤
Sorry bro but I am unsubscribing because of this thumbnail
As of January 1, 2023, several of the original Oswald shorts, as well as the character are in the public domain. Time for a horror movie about Oswald getting revenge!
What the actual reese's peanut butter puff  It told me Game Theory that had a new video but I'm here now ig lmao I'll enjoy this with my package of Ritz crackers
I didn't know about this?!?! The horror movie of Winnie the Pooh really be similar to a Texas Chainsaw movie vibe or is that just me who thinks that? 😶😶
.
These cold opens just get better and better every episode
What's next, Lion King murderer
Hah... This is the weirdest movie I've ever not seen
So Pooh is voiced by Patrick Warburton now?
Yay! Something like fnaf!!!!!!😊😊😊 Horror is my thing!😁 Spooky month baby!
The thing about copyright is completely complicated!!!
YOOOO
mat is amazing if i was scott cawthon i would ask him to feature 😄
Copyright is so confusing
lov ur vids
Abolish Copyright Laws, let's embrace the Chaos!!!
Amazing
More like winnie the poop
Solution: make your own stuff
It was still a better movie than Pootie Tang.
Thanks to foafy for voicing 2/3 of the intro
The movie got a 4% on Rotten Tomatoes, enough said.
Thanks a lot, like a needed another reminder of the god awful capitalist dystopian nightmare we’ve been living in for the past 100 years or so.
I just watched the shein style theory episode, and gotta say, copying good original stuff and turning them into things like this!!! Absolutely horrible
Watched the movie the other day - great concept and costumes, but terrible pacing and acting throughout. Although that little narrated hand drawn intro was great!
To be fair. If Disney hadn't made copyright last SO LONG, it wouldn't be such a big deal when something enters the public domain
so, "Taqueria Goku" will never be legal :(?
Winnie the Pooh is Cocaine Bear???
oswald is alsmost hear an dim going to make a cartoon called oswald the un lucky rabbit
What about Oswald 😢 hes still technically public domain, sense 1956 but Disney been trying to reclaim the rights to him for a while.
I think Disney’s biggest fear is being surpassed by dreamworks or Pixar. They are getting more desperate and making worse and worse movies. Therefore, the cycle goes on
me: *watches film theory*  matpat: "yes even you at home without your pants on"  me: how'd he know?
This is Winnie the Boo!😂
How’d he know I wasn’t wearing pants 🥲
how did he not get copyright striked
I’m starting to believe that Matpat’s arms would break off if he tried to take them off his shoulders.
I’m actually thinking of making a story based on a public domain character I’m thinking of making an independent YouTube TV series based on Zorro, and the biggest changes I would make is set it in modern times and also be in a American state near Mexico and also have him fight more supernatural threats stuff based on mythology, fairytales and religions.
We get a theory on this, but not emesis blue, truly a cinematic sin
I think you would make a new YouTube channel with a blue theme with the name of book theory
18:03 did he just reference the remember berries of South Park? I remember that
Matpat back at ruining our childhood again...oh wait somebody actually made a movie to ruin our childhood and more movies to ruin our childhood, great
Can’t wait for xX_Batman_Xx
Peter Pan neverland nightmare will be more akin to the actual Peter pan
I was not wearing pants when he said
I haven’t finished this yet, but I feel like Disney could actually benefit from having a Horror-Branded Channel, they already have movies like Coraline, there are a lot of people who like horror, they could get away with it and rake in probably as much as they did for Disney Channel, probably still do for Disney Channel and probably did and still do for their cartoons, Marvel, FreeForm, and whatever else they own now
Possibly Pooh Much to Handle
Never thought I would seen were Winnie the Pooh would have a bloody Move that a slasher and it being covered by my favourite Channel
😂 I love matpats intros they always make me laugh
Is it just me or did matpats voice turn a little kermit like midway through the video
if I can't use all of Supermans powers because of when they were introduced, what if you gave him new powers that he never had before? No ice breath but YES to fire breath.
" Please accept this magic *Life* stick "💀💀💀💀💀
17:52  Superman has a tail. That a reference to Goku??
I probably won’t look at Winnie the Pooh the same way again after this.
Try the "winter of 83" On youtube
lets start a petition for matpat to do a theory on life of luxery
Shouldn't Mickey be the secret hero of all of this. Like sure Disney has a story when it comes to copyright, and yes they might be an evil corporation that owns everything, but in the end if all people can think of is make horror movies showing the dark side of things. And to be fair, a Superman movie that doesn't start with WB and DC logos would be weird.
Well now I'm hoping for trademarks to come under scrutiny and have a time limit placed on them
comments are full of bots aghh
Instead of winne the Pooh this movie should be called Winnie poohs on the toilet ‘the taco bell aftermath of horror’
Public domain
i thoght this was fake
I did not expect to randomly be called out on the fact that I was not wearing pants
Bilbo x smaug 😂
Im your Biggest fan can i get a shoutout on next vid please
The movie exists because there is a limit to how much lawmakers will accept bribes from Disney
Matpat: So is disney gonna roll into town and pay the government to renew copyright.  Me: YESSSSSSSSS!!!!
i'll have you know, im wearing my pj/work out  pants, i'm just shirtless, so don't judge me closet recorder
so cool
so cool
so cool
Lmaooo wow I’m both surprised and glad you’re doing coverage for this slasher 😆😆😆 I saw it in theaters for free and almost walked out. It was just good ol gore for gore sake. I kinda wished there was more 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ like a wilder story followed. Nope. Just ///
so cool
When the movie came out a few months this is how I know the uploads are delayed
so cool
so cool
so cool
so cool
GD Shameless - thats all i *Need* to say   -I edit to add: Why the b'jezus did you nake a fAsHiOn thoery channel when you could have done a legal one? I guarantee more people would have been interested in the Bizzare world of Law
Does anyone else notice a weird audio shift around the 2/3s part of this video? Like MatPats voice is lower?
so cool
Hmmm I was wondering about the steam boat Willie issue . Guess it's going to be fun to see what happens if anything happens. To bad though The peterpan horror movie would be a good horror movie. Lots to work with plus the controversy involving the author . Once upon a time started getting dark with the character, can you imagine how far they can go without the Disney name
so cool
Disneys worst feat is losing ips
so cool
Is it just me or did MatPad's voice sound weird sometimes during the Video?
I had goosebumps lmao
so cool
Matt called me out on the not having pants thing
so cool
so cool
I remember hearing the news about Winnie getting a Horror Movie, but wasn't expecting him to look like Leatherface. But this Movie is not better than The Banana Splits and Willy's Wonderland.
matpat never miss
Mat how do you know I don't have my pants on
1:43 .  Uhh I have my pants on thank you for asking.
great work as always matt
The sad thing is, I was so excited for this movie but all the negative reviews just kind off put me off watching it :'(
This is purely made of the purest of nightmares. (at least the thumb nail)
I completely forgot that he was talking about a movie halfway through and began thinking that he was trying to portray Pooh as a psycho. I love sleep deprivation
people are gonna make winnie the pooh r34
Im sorry but it's so genius how you linked the end of this video with your new one on style theory
I swear I heard matpat's voice change @11:20 . Is anyone else noticing this? For two theories now I heard a change. it's slight, but it's there. I don't think it's bad or anything like that, just something I noticed. So be aware if Mat talks more about AI voice scripts, I think he's already using them and testing the waters. I see you, Matt.
Disney’s mortal enemy public domain laws.
This copyright BS seriously has to be stopped. This BS is literally all in people's minds. It has nothing to do with the real world if people stop accepting that crap. Just stop it!
Lore of Film Theory: This is Disney’s WORST Fear! (Winnie the Pooh) momentum 100
Copyright is way too long as it is. It should have never extended past 40 years in my opinion. That's easily the length of someone's entire career and it should have never been extended to protect copyright into the lifetime of a corporation.
I never expected  the cor to the game theory  logo was going to be a copyright theory
Week 30 asking for an Eddsworld theory.
Who’s excited for the C0c@ine Bear theory?
a channel made the exact same video talking about the same characters a year ago-
I hope MatPat covers the Welcome Home Puppet Show at some point, while it's got that "kids thing turned evil" aspect, it's been in production for years and it's quality, especially the use of REAL puppets, is incredible
technically, unpublished works and copyright might produce some trouble with proving its really from you. In many countries, there are recommendations to show your unpublished work to your lawyer because a lawyer is often seen as an extremely trustworthy witness by the law.
The movie is bad but this theory is hilarious
Dude why does your voice sound weird? Is this AI made?
Can you do a video on nope on how Jean jackets fly
how are fan films made then?
2:44 actually just the original steam boat willy short is becoming public domain next year. I think Disney Will forever bribe people to hold the rights to modern day Mikey till heat death.
HOW DID HE KNOW I WASN'T WEARING ANY PANTS?!
I'm surprised Disnwy hasn't tried suing these guys into oblivion. I'm pretty sure that they can do that since the horror movie version looks just like Disney's Pooh. Yes, Pooh Bear is in the public domain, but Disney still has the rights to _their_ version of the bear.
Can you do a theory of broly power level please
Oh boi...
its the fact that this was posted only 27 minutes ago and it already has 57k views 😂
How many matpat are there there's no way a YouTube can post so much im normally getting 2 videos ever 5 months
I was the first one to watch this
Pooh bear is now the same thing as something like ancient mythology, or folktales, it’s just that the bear was let into the wild
Time is running out for mickey mouse
I was so excited when I saw MatPat release this theory. It’s awesome!
Yeah I watched it last night but it made me mad because everyone was stupid in it
You need to specify you can do whatever you want with the original source material not with versions made by other studios  You can use the Pooh from the book just not Disney’s
The creepiest Thing about this video, Matpat sais: "yes you sittin at home without your pants on." Me (sittin at home without my pants on): WHAAAAAAAT?
They had the chance to make a Barney horror movie.
Yeah, two videos per minute, but where is FNAF?
[9:59] Ayy, 2013 Mickey, shout out to Tara Billinger!
No more copyright extensions!!!
Clicked the thumbnail without hesitation  ...once it's mat pat it's gold
Im actually wearing two pairs of pants
You explained copyright and trademark better than my teacher
From the panel, I thought you were talking about china's involvement in the film induestry
But wait, didn’t Oswald the Lucky Rabbit enter the Public Domain thus year? Why are people always forgetting poor Oswald? Anyway, how is Disney gonna use the Trademark loophole to keep people from using him?
I feel like matpat can make anything in to a theory, ANYTHING what's next Sherlock Holmes. I honestly wouldn't be surprised
Hey! I'm wearing gym shorts!
I live in Canada no I wouldn't look like you just do carradice that where you adore I live
A peter pan horror adaptation could actually work quite well. I mean, he does kidnap 3 children
Steamboat willie is entering the public domain not  mickey mouse
MATTPAT: THIS IS DISNEY'S *WORST* FEAR..  ME: Whinne the Pooh?
A good example of “we own Game Theory but not Theory based media” but in a reverse way  Anyone remember that failed attempt to capitalize on the React Format by the FineBrothers with ReactWorld?
Yo you should check out Lockwood and co I don't think this will see the light of day but I'm a fan of you and I'll continue to try there's a mystery and I think you should check it out
I never understood public domain as a good thing. To me it makes sense that what was created by someone remains the property of that person or their continuing family line. At least for IP, if it's for tech, like the printing press it makes sense so that there's not a monopoly on it. But I could be missing something
Look up the hobbit cafe in Houston Texas. They got got written permission to use hobbit in the 50s  from the Tolkien estate.
Joe?
Mat you have opened my eyes to this like seriously Winnie the Pooh horror movie you've got to be kidding me
this movie is so goofy i can’t take it seriously
And this movie is only the beginning
Can't wait the final part of the fnaf timeline❤❤❤👍👍👍
Calling Legal Eagle!
I got a notification from one of the theorist channels and thought the FNAF timeline was going live. Oh well, still can’t complain about any theorist videos.
I think one thing these people trying to cash in on beloved stories are going to need to realize is that their popularity is short-lived. Horror versions of childhood favorites are so overdone and honestly stupid. I get that this one made money, but eventually they won't, and it'll come a lot faster than other takes. Here's hoping we get some creative takes, but I'm not holding my breath.
Pov ur cinder garden teacher is named winey yes my spelling is correct
This is such a bad movie!
Definitely not  first
one of the most powerful tools for getting around trademark is the word "The" so instead of having the title "Superman" you instead put "The Superman"
Sorry I'm mentioning this, but if Micky becomes public domain, we're probably going to see an OFFICIAL recreation/film of Suicide Mouse creepypasta since that's one of the few popular Disney horror stories...
Mat pat is MY worst fear he proved that my dream job is possible so now I feel obligated to pursue it
Right but if you decide not to even glance at a different countries copywrite laws then you rather easily alienate your viewers who may otherwise care about this kind of topic
Popeye should also be in the Public Domain by now or next year.
This is the beginning of the Ferry Tale Horror Movies. This is something we must accept.
“Yes you, sitting without your pants one” Me who was on the toilet: *uhh wtf*
Video idea who has the highest body count in the ya book series animorphs
MAKE A THEORY ABOUT TERRARIA PLZ!!!!!!
I like it
Awesome and cool!
My teddy is Winnie the Pooh….. what did they do to him? 😢
Speaking of ridiculous looks like Sony is making a low budget Saint Seiya movie that should have gone straight to Netflix instead of coming to theaters
Next Horror' Disney Is Back
untill now
The Grinch did the same thing. Anyone seen The Mean One?
didn't Watch the episode
I hope Disney makes a horror version of Disney princess movie. You know, just for 'fun' lol
I know it just happened and your videos take very long to make but I would love to see a couch sit down talking about the TikTok situation in congress
Is it just me or does Mat kinda sound like Kermit at 11:17 when he says "above"?
i love these horor theoryes
Who else thinks he needs to make a theory on the lore of senor wooly?
i guess people can still call him superguy
E
Yeah lol who would copyright a word like “theory” or “react” that would be crazy! Right?
Who ever made Winnie the pooh in to a horror movie, go crawl into a pit and die sincerely, me.
Bruh saw the thumbnail and thought that MatPat accidentally uploaded a Fnaf video to film theory 💀
never mind
Great video has always!
Some point in the intro they know that I did not have any pants
I have a addiction to game theory and film theory
On an average day in ohio: Inside an regular family's house Youngest child: Mom can we have winnie the pooh from the store?  Mom: No sweetie we already winnie the pooh at home Winnie the pooh from home:
--SUPER--   --MAN-- Serial Killer
Dude i like Winnie the pooh, i like watching him when i was small and such it hurts me when you make movies out from very old days, like come-on dude, it will upset parents who watched episodes or read the book and there is a horror show about it.
NICE
we love that matpat can make literally anything a theory.
nice
1:46 Hey! I have pants on, where's my share of the franchise?
1:49 how did he actually know that?!
I’m actually excited for this
The movie is so good that it made 400k during the video: 01:07 - total box office is 3,8 million 18:00 - total box office is 4,2 million
Hooray I'm here 19 minutes early
*"Idea: make a film theory about the smile tapes"*
Nein! Not the Horror The Pooh Bear 👀 That's worse than Spoopy (Kekw) Oofs, Sadge to see a belovrd character getting turned into nightmare fuel, concerned me if mote will end up like that as well. What a vid that was, Keep it up & Stay Safe Team 🎥 😎 👊
It's my birthday 🎉🎉🎉
WHY WOULD THEY DO THIS TO WINNIE THE POOH! DISREPECTFUL! DISREPECTFUL I SAY!
hey hey hey my pants is on... shitless but my pants are on... NOW ITS OFF
You were supposed to post fnaf time line today
4:52 he said it it! The 4th channel is stile theory!
I love that matpat can look at a innocent Disney character and think to himself loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooore.
Super-Man is Klarc Cend
Actually disneys worst fear is dream works by the year 2119 Disney will be forever forgotten and the dreamworks renisonce will forever expans
And I think some characters might even be immune to this entirely  Like for instance Godzilla's trademark is his entire body in the trademark mean you going to have to make some pretty radical differences to be able to use Godzilla which at that point is it really Godzilla again though I'm not a copyright expert so I can't say for certain
He saying me without my pants on hit hard since I'm im in rhe bathroom.
mickey is back!!!
nostalgia berries at the end instead of memberberries. Good one, Matt
Do the fucking owl house please 😢😢😢😢
wait until Mickey Mouse becomes public domain. horror movies featuring Mickey Mouse. or anime horror.
Soon we will be getting a Mickey Mouse horror movie, and we have to sadly deal with it.
I actually was wondering if you were going to tackle this Theory because I was looking into it myself when I was going back explaining to someone about how Disney constantly changed copyright law to protect their ownership of Mickey Mouse. Happy to see you address it!!!
hiho kermet dee frog hear
do not forget about The Mean One (the Grinch)
oh pooh bear, the moist honey filled, squishy touchy bear .o.
But i do have pants on.
Rip poo 😭
Mickey slaughtering innocents in a schlocky 80's horror comedy isn't a movie, it's a documentary.
Good video
I have 35 "original characters" in my mind 😉
Screw Batman and the Joker. MatPat and Mickey have the true greatest rivalry of all time.
Fk copyright laws. ALL of them! Capitalist bullshit.
SOME THING SCARY YESSSSSSSSS
hi
We need a Pinocchio horror movie
This theory was legit scarier than the actual movie
He can turn anything into a theroy
Final fnaf theory timeline is what I want
BTW, They couldn't release the Movie in Germany.
thank you soooo much matpat now i cant unsee that the D from the Disnely logo looks like a G
"yes you without your pants on." how did he know i was naked bruhhh 😭
Movie sucked ball and what’s with the ending, I skipped the whole movie and saw the ending
The Thumbnail is just pure nightmare fuel…
7:33 CS2 is inescapable FROM EVERY CORNER
Not even two minutes in and already I've been called out How'd he know I'm not wearing pants?   Oof uh... seems like the US might need to rethink their trademark laws...
I agree
I wanna theory about Charlie the tuna fish because let’s be honest here why the heck would a tuna fish be selling his own kind out and I mean come on it might be a shark take situation where Charlie ain’t even a tuna I just wanna know
The lore is insane
1:47 how did he know?
Disney is going to pay for it to be extended yet again. This ain’t the first time mickey was supposed to be public
mat pat I stole his honey now im locked in a basement
I recently watched this movie. It was pretty good except I watched it during class and my teacher saw the one scene where Winnie the Pooh did some things to a girl in the warehouse
Oddly I first heard about this movie when China tried to censor it at Hong Kong
Oh DEAR GAWD MATPAT!! I just woke up!! Lol your scary Pooh just scared the 💩 out of me!!! 😂
1:48 that caught me off guard. HE KNEW!
17 min and 35k view
The copyright and trademark systems need a revision, why can people copyright colors and smells?
I’m 11 and I watched this bc I wanted to spend my time doing smth but now I might not sleep at night
I’m actually happy about this. When things enter the public domain it becomes harder to know what is canon and what isn’t  Edit: this got multiple likes in twenty minutes I did not know that people cared so much
Dwmn
Jokes on you, I put my pants on before watching this
What gunna be next Mickey Mouse the murderer
How did you guess about the pants?
Me personally I LOVED this MOVIE!!!!!
That winnie the pooh sounded like joe Swanson form family guide.
Oh god
shoutout to tom scott, make copyright 50 years!!
Finally I love film theory so much
Yeah, I dont have pants on. So what? D:<
Does Matt voice sounds different
When's the final fnaf thing
Your voice sounds a little off are you sick or something?
I honestly can't wait for the inevitable dumpster fire which is going to be the Micky Mouse horror film
This is every person’s worst nightmare
I watched this movie and it was great
Early
This video deserves a sub, so I will sub
The entertainment industry has collapsed. Everything original has been eschewed for remakes and content that has entered public domain
The reason why we didn’t see the others in the movie was due to them going into the public domain wasn’t till like 2025 or 2026 I think
1:48 I was watching this wills on the toilet. I genuinely freaked out.
💙
Get ready for Steam Punk Super-Man
Can't believe you actually watched this it completely ruined childhood like you do!
-_..-_----._-_--.__--
Oh no honey my one weakness
Wow I never thought that Winnie the pooh would be a horror character
amazing vid!
why does matt sound weird halfway through the theory
bro when that last fanf timeline video comming out
in the cartoon tiger is the best charecter
I am happy to listen about Mickey mouse protection act after soo long
The movie…. 1/10. The Matpat video, 10/10
One question. WHY MY CHILDHOOD
Oh bother
Where’s the fnaf timeline
wait!! style theory ?
isn't Chinese president Xi Jinping (arguably [almost] as powerful as the US president) often being ridiculed as having the body, movement style and facial expressions of Winnie the Pooh? if Disney does anything with this character we can bet it will be used to further have fun with president Xi. the man just got himself re-elected and removed any prior restrictions on his tenure, so we might have him for life
First comment!
Halfway trought the video i realized dimanbolt literly made the same video a week ago
this came out 10 minutes ago, and it has 22k views you people didn't even finish the video
I love your videos!!!!!❤️
The scariest things on the world : copyright and trademark.
How did u no i have no pants 🤯
The mouse is back
Looking so forward to seeing adult films with these iconic characters in them. I feel like Disney has been Fing everyone for so long I would love to see the mouse get F. lol
So all I’m saying is fanfiction writers have been doing this for years now public domain caricatures or not.
I'll forever waiting the day that the mouse falls in Public domain.
Mickey mouse a  horror movie oh oh God please no noooooooooo
When he said yes, you sitting there without your pants on I was dressing and I didn’t have my pants on
THE FILM THEORY THE FILM THEORY IS REAL
See, the Peter Pan one makes sense for a horror movie. Cause he's an asshole. And always has been. It's why I liked the Neverland storyline in OUAT.
Oh my lord I’m the first of the 10k viewers!!
Grumb
Mickey mouse is a recurring villain
I really love you're voice and videos I'm subscribed to all chanels
I love how mat manages to stay consistent with all his channels
That film was so dumb and stupid man. Yet I did find some enjoyment in it. I just wished they did not make so seriously, hopefully in the later films they play up absurdly.
Yo😊
Plz
Hi I'm a really good theorist plz can you give me a shout-out or something
What ever power Disney has the internet has way more
Boo
You should've talked about the Grinch horror movie
1:49 how do you know?    HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE NOT PANT ON???   HOW DO YOU KNOW???
At this point they just ran out of idea and made this
Actually, i have my pants on.
I am here
What will they do with mickey mouse when he becomes public domain
omg How
Nice try Mat, i have pamts, but you might've charmed em off me with all the theory talk. *blush*
Well it seems that the reign of Disney is almost coming to an end
I honestlly liked the movie mostly because im very easy going with horror like i loved halloween ends and texas 2022 . Im a weird guy
Is it just me or is Mat pats Mickey voice better then the South Park one
1:48 How did he know?! I’m actually watching this in the bathroom. I watch on the toilet sometimes. I actually don’t have my pants on at this moment
Hi Matt.Loved this theory and I am still waiting for the other fnaf chapter.
Micky got some explaining to do…
Ooooof
Glitch in doors can be seen in rooms being the only inter dimensional beside bob. Character
please can you share your thoughts on this, i think matt reeves and robert pattinson's the batman 2022 universe was best to base for dcu rebooted universe, it would have been much different from mcu.
It’s been awhile since we saw The MatPat Mickey Mouse
Film Theor                                y
Am I the only one who got a bit caught off guard being called out for actually not wearing pants while watching this video?
noooo! no more trashy hick movies when you can tell how low budget it doesn't deserve more fucking dude looked like Shrek from behind
Very good video
#FilmTheorySquad
Does copyright also work on memes or vines
So I can make my own Winnie the Pooh and I’m not talking about horrible low-budget horror movies I’m talking about making sweet amazing books about it
Why don't you make a theory about My Singing Monsters!?
Mat- you have little time to explane WHY FNAF VIDEO IS NOT OU- Your fingers are at risk You have 5 hours
Nice a new video :D
So when are we getting a game theory horror movie? Matpat being able to conjure the channels theories into a mystical force to be able to answer the greatest theory of them all: where did it all start?
The continuing bit of mickey mouse being evil/bad is always so funny 😂😂😂
We all know Disney is going to manipulate the government to avoid losing Mickey Mouse to the Public Domain. They’ve done it before by lobbying for the Mickey Mouse Protection Act. However, the government has said that they might actually push back against further attempts
And people ask me why I'm a hard abolitionist on intellectual property
Then again, we had the whole Spider-Man grave incident not too long ago.🫠
Younown the rights to your thumbnails and scripts? Not anymore, since you sold off. How's the weather out there, Mr "Not My Own Face Anymore"?
early!
Who else wants to stay up all night over New Years' to try to immediately take the Mickey Copyright before Disney can
Matpat you should watch ethreal snakes Mickey saga
Peter Pan kinda makes sense
Why does horror winnie the pooh sound like kronk
DO A FILM THEORY ON SOUTH PARK PLEASE JUST FIND SOMETHING
this is the earliest i've managed to be luv from UAE :)
Please someone ban this peace of garbage version of my favorite Disney books
Oh my...that intro tho
Yay
when is the next episode of the fnaf timeline out? TELL ME PLEASE. I love your vids😀
Mat really is a worthy enemy to disney
mhm ok
As a fan of the art of movies; i can apreciate the relative novelty of the concept and hope they improve their writing and skill over time. some of the greatest movie makers had EARLY great ideas that were badly done. give 'em some rope.
2:41 When that happens, I'll be waiting for that five nights at treasures island movie, basically the horror treasure island series
An eternity with Mickey  A fate worse than death
If Sherlock Holmes is in the public domain, someone could legally publish johnlock fanfic
aha i am early
Disney is only scared of losing money
This isn't the new Pooh This is a Fanfic that some lunatic decided need to be made
Love your theory's! why did the guy sound like Kronk in the intro of the video?
nice
Disney didn’t come up orthodox most of their movies so Disney is really just afraid of everyone else being able to use properties they kept a monopoly on.   About that I think this horror film will be any good
trademark barrier
The real fear is Disney not coming up with anything good or original these days.
hi
1:48 h-how did you know?!?!
ill save you!! want me to bite the Mouse’s neck and torcher him?? how dare he tie you up!
Matpat I love your videos
Here in 4 mins
the normal winnie the pooh is scarier than the horror one because he takes all our honey
so mat, when is the fnaf ultimate timeline part 3 part 2 comming out? jk tho you've been working very hard on all 4 channels and deserve a break you're one of the most consistant and entertaining youtuber and probably my favourite keep it up mat
It’s actually the worst fear of BOTH Disney AND China lol
Avatar: The way of Poop
I mean, they already making bad live action remakes of their animated movies so I wouldn't put it above the mouse to make horror movies based on them
Early 3 minutes!

Hello
Nice
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
I know it's been a while since the subnautica theory i need MORE LORREEE
The video is great and all I'm just wondering how MatPat knew I wasn't wearing pants.....
I can smell you.
Everyone has to grow up CHRISTOPHER ROBIN glad I get to grow up with these theories
Five nights at Pooh’s… I can’t wait for it! And I’m totally not making it up! 😯
This is early
hey matpat I have sweatpants on and yes I can't breathe
Can't be worse than the disney live actions movies... right?... *RIGHT?!*
7345th
MatPat’s ongoing nightmares involving the Big Mouse himself, Mickey.
I don’t want to seem like a robot, I just keep putting the same thing on your videos so I can hopefully see this happen!
.
HOW DID YOU KNOW I DIDNT HAVE MY PANTS ON MATPAT?! HOW?! But anyways guys, appreciate how much work matpat (and his team, definitely his team) puts into his videos, so Leave a like, and subscribe. It will change your life, it surely changed mine.
5.9kth
Thank you for covering this
Im so confused on why they made a horror movie about Winnie the Pooh.
Oh a new Disney/Horror movie theory from matpat can’t wait to what it it.
lol
How did you know I wasn’t wearing any pants?
Much as I don't like what Disney is doing to protect it's properties. I hate the fact that people are turning notable properties, which in all fairness are within the public domain, into horror films ESPECIALLY Pooh.
This video is amazing and crazy, props to Matt and the team
nah 3 minutes ago and 5.9 k
Exposing Xi Jinping for who he is!
I was here early what
:0
nice
Disney needs to be disbanded
"Yes, you, sitting at home without pants on"  I feel called out.
The movie intro in that creepy drawing form was so amazing. Made you feel bad for them and it kinda made me feel like it would have worked as a short film 🤷🏾‍♂️
Here's hoping you don't have any viewers in China lol
2 minutes and already 1.4k likes 😭😭😭
BRO ITS BEEN 2 MINUTES YALL QUICK
Who's ready for Snow Red and the seven deadly sins.
Winnie the Pooh in China:
1:47 how did he know I had no pants on!?!
Hey Matpat! So, I was wondering, what is the likely hood of the Technodrome actually being able to drill through the earth and the planet stay in tact? Would what it is made of effect the outcome, or when this happened because the earth does change over time. How deep would it have to be? Could it actually survive the earths core? Are there any examples of something extremely large drilling and moving through the earth that way? The TMNT show from 1987 is so good and, I believe, stands the test of time. If you would do a film theory on it, it would be so cool, and i think a lot of people would enjoy that bit of nostalgia, young and old. Ps. For anyone who wants to see this happen, drop a reply on this comment in support as well as liking it and leaving your own separate comment on this video as well as Matpat's other videos
it is impossible for someone to have watched the whole video already mar/25/2023 11:15 am
Can't believe matpat did a video on that, what next mickey mouse adult comedy movie 😂
Omg I love this account so much I haven’t stopped watching it for years so happy i got here 17 secs after posting 💀
Didn't expect this for an episode, not going to lie
Bro just uploaded a vid now and it has 2 k veiws 😂
He did not just call me out without pants
That Pooh looks like the life of luxury friendo
nice
Dam i first tought it was Xi Jinping for a sec
Whats wrong with this world?

Oh good he’s gonna ruin Winnie the Pooh for me now.
Matpat loved the boobie scene
Plus I'm surprised that Disney didn't copyright the movie
Oi, they made Santa Claus a killer
Ok now I'm officially convinced he can turn anything into a theory.
why does this movie exist and why is it so funny for literally all the wrong reasons
ONE MINUTE AGO YESSSS I AM SO HAPPY 😁

Hi
I love how mat manages to stay consistent with all his channels
I never expected a winnie the pooh theory
Film Theory idea: Check out Spooky Month! It has some goofy lore that is very interesting! Maybe you can find out how Roy's mental state is after his uncle sexually abus- OOP! I've said to much....
Here’s a theory what if one of the Winnie the Pooh cast has a dark secret?😅-aaron
edit: vids part 3 of fnaf matpat
Salut
Matpat's slowly losing sanity with those
A style theory at the same time as a film theory?  Nice!!!
Hehe
Theories are the best no question!

Hi mattpat
The fact that Bliid abd Honey was made just feels so wrong.
Hola
This is pretty cool You should get more likes You deserve to get 20 million likes Good job
Been a while since we’ve heard the Mickey Mouse voice over here. Still just as good as always :)
cool
Winnie the pooh getting a horror movie is wild
How, MATPAT exactly do you come up with this stuff? Where do you get the instinct that whine the Pooh is a serial killer or a trombone later is summoning Trazon?
Funny
Cheese Touch
Film Theory is getting creative with their Theory Videos now...
