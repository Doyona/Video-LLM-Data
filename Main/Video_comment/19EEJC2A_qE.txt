167$
19:12 bro got a cup lol
How can Tim call Eric's Gear Indestructible!? IT LITERALLY BROKE... TWICE!!!
Next time I go to Home Depot I’m wearing catchers gear
I like the turtle one
Eric is just the content character. Never does very well. I guess I am here for it.
Poop
19:07  😂
Push the button!! 😂
10:00 OMG Eric actually did something smart 😂😂
Every challenge video I watch is Eric doing the challenge with concrete
2:32 I got the DAWG IN ME !😂
Why does Eric look like a confused toddler
If Eric didn’t use concrete in a challenge where he has to make something I’d cry
When Trevor Bauer pitches to Eric you should put support beams so Eric won’t get folded
You guys should do sliding mits.also big big fan of what you do
Lmao did noone else catch that AG1 commercial, its incredibly tasty for how healthy it is for you, aka dont blame us please when you buy and it tastes like crap😅
Make a cup
Eric taking out their best player is a clear winner for me hahaha.
Eric swigging off the 1/2 gal bottle of Jack had me cracking up!
Did you get released from the giants farm system
What's up with Eric and concrete
Eric I now is going to lose
Of course it was concrete
The oh in your face while holding a bottle of Jack Daniels is the best quote of all time
Eric is what makes momentum so great
Why does Eric always do Concrete
24:48 “I feel skinny”😂
None of these guys are very smart. They should be looking at 3/4 plywood or even 1/4" hardibacker board. These are both relatively lightweight and extremely durable
So damn funny that Adam had the biggest budget and he got the most hurt
Make ur own nut cups 😂😂😂😂 Eric will use concrete
Possibly the funniest video I've ever watched
Eric, please listen to me, because this is for you. Stop trying to do concrete for homemade because you always lose in the looks category. It’s also always too heavy, as we saw here.
when i was 12 i got hit the same way by a guy who threw 72 in little league, it jumped up and bit my throat and i was in pain, this is why you dont make 12 year olds catch for 14 year olds, people
How did no one think to use spray foam?
The fact that Eric has probably spent more time with concrete than with Sophia is hilarious
I already know Eric is folded 0:34
is that a crash bandicoot transition sfx? 🔥🔥🔥🧡🤎
I’m still confused why they still use Eric for these homemade equipment videos 🤦🏻‍♂️
Dose Eric no how to make some thing with out concrete 😂
Eric lookin like Pizza the Hutt in that gear 😂
Eric breaking the cart😂
9:53 BuT i FeEl LoVeD
Make a Ho made sliding mitt🎉❤
Eric is the king of folding
You guys should use all the homemade equipment you have and play a game with
🎉
12:07 GYYYAAATTTT
“I’m good at math” that’s what all Asians say
what eric
All Eric does is wear concrete he never learns
I love how Eric’s just by himself at 1:14
I’ve always hated Tim such a douche
9:35 why didn't I know you have a pitty puppy?!?!?!?
This was hilarious to watch and was not expecting to see fivepoints here but love to see it!
When in doubt, get concrete.
28:12 the best part
Build a cup like a nutty b buddy

Somebody please tell Eric that everytime he has used concrete he has losted
Homemade umpires equipment
Homemade shin guard
Let me guess next there gonna do making custom baseball cleats
5:37
The lonely reason he is good at math is because he is Asian
you could just look on eric face and feel the sadness in his heart
6:00 Eric is so right Kinder Buenos slap
gyat at 12.07
gyat
Concrete is  better
You should have done the homemade gear with the homemade catching mitts
All Asians 5:38 are good at math
the fact that Eric was a catcher in college and in the minors, but couldn't create catching gear is pretty damn funny
Hey, I know Five Points!  Cool to see you guys collab!
1:10 did you just flash girl from Ipanema
7:38
10:38
eric :CONCRETE
5:03
eric looks like he has frozen pizza on his chest and shins.
Homemade cup?
Doesn’t need more duct or concrete😂
If they do a whole can make the best concrete catchers gear or something other Eric could finally get a win
Eric had a weird addiction to concrete
At 12:07 u can see his balls
Cause he Asian
I swear eric always gets 1
12:07 😂😂

If eric had had a actual,person rushing at them, he would have a few broken bones
12:06 Erics butt
Homemade catchers mitt
Rush hour 🔛🔝
Love
The collab I love,
That was the best video I’ve ever seen😂
The bond between Kevin and Eric is something different love it
Eric's "Concrete" lack so much creativity that it's funny
I love the way Eric took the cart to the chest, why don't replay LOL
This is just Dominican Republic simulator
I am watching this video for the 15th time at this point, and it never gets old!
Eric when he threw it down he got folded and I can't stop laughing
Everything Eric makes is trash. I love it.
Eric killed the runner
Foam gap filler and use paint trays as molds.
18:00 Eric be walking like the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz
You guys need to give the Home Depot guy an ump uniform and have him throw you out
That was a awesome and funny video. I never laughed that hard in my life.
Fire content😂😂😂
Need to make your own "nutty buddy" and have Eric test them
Eric using concrete is not funny for me anymore
Love this video😂😂😂😂
They ought to make five point vids a member of Momentum 👍
Scrub mommy and daddy are my neighbors
Eric has an obsession with concrete
He broke his wheels
Ngl whats eric obsession with concrete 😂😂
Bro, why do concrete and it’s so funny that literally I watched every moment of video almost and guess what I actually had to rewind the footage to see how many bombs Eric has had and he had like 104
23:12 "GIM ME A MINUTE" Eric
Eric might be the dumbest person I’ve ever seen. ( but it’s kinda funny)
Yall should build home made teas
"I don't need a f****** glove" GOT ME ON THE FLOOR!!!
I ALMOST DIED FROM LMAO😂😂😂😂😂
Not Kevin managing to lay down great bunts with his blocking
Is Eric and Kevin brothers
God loves you
Every round for Eric made me just die of laughter. His sheer commitment to the concrete gear is just so funny every time
The fact that Eric just doesn't learn that concrete is not a good idea is just hilarious. 🤣🤣
King of bunting🥇
10:52 Aaron Krause IS THE CEO OF SCRUB DADDY
Ag1 is absolute trash
It never fails.  Another challenge, another example of Sim whining like a complete B!tch
It's hard to decide.  King of Juco, King of Concrete, or King of Failure... I think I'm going for the last one.
You guys need to make 5 points vids part of Momentum
14:24 Eric’s face is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
You guys should do A game with all the homemade stuff
When the irs sees all the receipts for the concrete”Wtf i thought they were YouTubers not contractors” lol 😂
1:11 My boys is just casually shopping
you need to put scrub daddy's in cold water so they are hard they use bubble warp to keep them together.
That judge was annoying af
Eric’s duct tape is concrete lol 😂
😂
Chelsea mixtures if fright and entertainment was great
Omg that was funniest shit I ever seen and dying laughing 😂😂
You guys should make homemade sliding mitts
Eric was just so funny in this video 28:08 23:49 14:56
12:07 gyat
Kevin makes the channel bro why does he have catchers gear on in public
Tosh's 2 piece helmet was actually pretty slick. He surprised me with the use of the rackets
Imagine the next thing is, we made homemade baseball fieldS
It's a clear example of why Sim didn't make the major league.  He whines constantly
You guys really need to make 5 points vids a member of Momentum
Is this just me or does anybody else love the way Kevin laughs 😂😂😂
When the series is over you guys should use all the stuff in BP
Ok but why does the Asian have the dog in him
Eric is the king of content, even if he loses lmaooo
The home depot guy commenting on how many times yall have been there was golden
S
Holy shit
Cool suit
Holy hell I've never laughed this hard in my life. Def not worth watching late night cause I legit woke up my parents. God Eriks concrete idea was too funny
25:06 Eric, drinking whiskey while yelling “IN YOUR FACE”😂😂😂😂
11:32 AYO        Oh I’m just dirty minded😅
make home made batting glove.  and the glove need to go inside a baseball glove

23:58 and 28:13 had me laughing 😂
Eric's hairline.... big ooooooooof 🤣
Do homemade evo shield next

Kevs ready to catch a ball everywhere he goes
Home made baseball game plz
5PV: "You guys are sure we won't get injured doing this, right?" Everyone else: "Don't worry, we won't hurt a hair on your head."
Tosh is the budget king💯. That's the second batle he won in favor of the budget rule👍
Eric is the King of Concrete at this point
Homemade cleats is a good idea
You guys should do live at bats with everything homemade
I wanted to kill my cat before but you changed my mind
Next thing we need is a homemade stadium
Make your homemade backstop that would be sick
19:09 though😂😂😂😂 NUTTYBUDDY
Eric's gear has "folded" like him
Such a dumbass. Lmao the company is called Kinder. Not bueno
@fivepointsvids getting shafted there
Do homemade catchers glove or bat grip
I’ve been waiting forever for this video. As a catcher this makes me happy
Justice for Eric he deserved to win
Next challenge. Homemade nutty buddy
What are the symptoms of inhaling concrete dust? These commonly include bronchitis-like symptoms such as persistent cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. People also suffer from weakness, fatigue, fever, night sweats, leg swelling and bluish discoloration of the lips.
I’d love to see some Homemade stuff revisited with this different budgets concepts
Eric failing so hard made me laygh so hard i almost peed myself
23:03 the sound she makes when you put it in.
you should make batting gloves
To continue the homemade series (and give Eric a chance for concrete to win) you guys should make an Evoshield elbow guard
Idk how to explain it, but eric acts like a little kid in Home Depot and it is the funniest shit ever
Eric throwing or attempting to throw down to second had me dying 😂😂😂
Why is Eric actually being chill in a video
Video idea: you have to use your homemade baseball’s and your homemade bats well, catching with the homemade catchers gear
eric breaking the cart had me weakkk
Can you do homemade baseball. Bating gloves 🧤 pls
I never laughed so hard on a youtube video!!! Eric's catchers gear testing was just too hilarious!!
Eric with the Jack Daniels in the middle of the challenge 🤣
Do homemade nut cups or cleats plz
Homemade Pitching Machine Evo sheild elbow and shin guard or a homemade bat weight would all be fun

What's up with Eric and concrete? What am I missing?
Might sound messed up but Eric reminds me of ji man Choi on the pirates💀
Eric is the king of concrete
This is the most funny video I have seen out of momentum 😂😂😂
Eric casually with a bottle of Jack😂
Tosh is definitely the most innovative of the group, he can really do a lot with a little, that said, I don’t know what he would have done without the boogey board from Adam
Make cleats
Which Home Depot are you at?
Chelsea’s laugh and Eric’s entertainment makes this my fav momentum vid
Momentum needs to make homemade cleats and shin guards
You guys should have about a week or two to make all the gear you need except clothes for a baseball game and then play a baseball game with an actual team (also obviously where clothes just don’t make them)
Eric looks like a Roblox Avatar pose at min 14:23
Eric got that Kim Jong Un hair cut
Make homemade cleats.
Y’all should play a home made baseball game with all of your homemade stuff
You guys should make homemade cleats next I want to see Eric make them out of concrete😂
Day 1 of asking to make homemade cups
Chelsea laugh was making me dying laughing the entire testing for eric
The beunu does go crazy tho
Adam gets his helmet, knocked off and gets a bloody nose Erik casually drinking Jack Daniels straight out of the bottle
You have to get Jordy Bahl to pitch to yall
You should do homemade bats again but this time y'all each have $500
Shoutout to the person who I saw kept commenting “make you own catchers gear” until it finally happened
How about homemade batting gloves
bro erics good at math bc hes asian nah not really he just hits so much tanks that the baseball gods blessed him with smarts and strength
What we’ve learned from this series: Concrete does not make good baseball gear.
Do more videos where u guys plays in mens league or softball or pitching and hitting off other people. OUTSIDE  not in the training center.
I think the green looks the best
They should do homemade batting gloves
Homemade cleats or homemade cups
8:37 he’s actually got that dog in him
This was fucking hilarious 😂😂😂😂
For the next building challenge you should do first base mitts
You ready buddy yep 😂😂
Home depot and instant concrete should sponsor a video
you always have to protect your nuttttttttttttts
500k keep up posting great content
we need cole not 5 points
I thought adams was the best
Do a video with Olivia pichardo
The ninja turtle gear was def the best looking one
Lift small bunt the ball hit bombs over the wall
Homemade cleats right now
W Scrub MOMMYS❤
Use all homemade gear and do live abs
Where’s cole at 😢
I don’t want to believe Eric is really this stupid 😂
Eric's favorite word is concrete
Try using all of the homemade gear and just the homemade gear in a game
Eric inventing new ways to get folded,
They absolutely shit on the guy that got hit in the face and he probably put in the most effort to make his gear😂😂
@ericsim you need "king of juco concrete company" tshirts
I swear you all win!!! This channel is the best of the best across all of YT Land!!! End of story!!! 👉💯👈💜💜💜👊😆😲😲😲😲👈
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Y’all should make a vid of pitching y’all homemade balls with y’all home made spider tack  and hit the ball with the homemade bats and catch the ball with the home made gloves and also hit the homemade ball with those bats y’all tried the make better and you should catch the homemade balls with the homemade glove with the homemade catching gear
If anyone can get folded as a catcher it's Sim.
watch Eric with an open blade, cutting towards himself, pointing the blade AT HIS EYES …. yeah he got that dawg in him.
Dude Eric?
It's gonna be hilarious if they ever make homemade cups
Congratulations on 500 K
I wanna see a vid where Eric actually tries to make a good part of equipment cause he has potential he is like obe wan
make DI(why) cleats, shin guards and arm guards, or batting gloves!
Eric not knowing how concrete works pains me
Next we need a game with all of the homemade equipment
next do dugout snacks like big sunflower seeds
I cried of laughter when Eric broke the card at the end
Tosh's looks like the rawlings mach series 😂
This has been one of the funniest videos in a long time, the only thing missing with Eric's epic failure would have been his goat noise
Kevin is making his own duct tape armor
Of course a catcher would think concrete would be good to use lol.
Video Idea Do a Homerun derby But With Custom bats from Home Depot
We need to see homemade cups!!!
I like how Eric was laughing with Jack Daniel in his hand
I love this series keep it up!
Adam made that out!
Homemade cleats when?
tosh looks like yan gomes back there💀
Should do a dumpster diving to make baseball equipment
19:08  Now that's the content we're all here for 🤣
Eric And Concrete name a more iconic duo
They just need to ban Eric from home depot 😂😂
I just keep thinking about the undress/dress portion. Why not just tape them to stretchpants and wear shorts underneath? You had 300 dollars! You could have bought a full  outfit of stretchgear and dunked it in concrete and sponges.
Sould make homemad cleats
y’all should do homemade battling gloves next
MAKE YOUR OWN CUPSSSS!!!!!
Hey momentum Homemade cups would be so funny 😂😂😂😂
Your laugh in this video is absolutely contagious 😂 I can't stop laughing!
Just for how funny this was they should’ve given Eric the win lmao 😆😆😆😆
Concrete bit needs to be retired
They should do custom cleats
video on trending wow
Not a big fan of Adam on the show but man did he take some shots and stuck it out. Bring back the softball girls. One of them making catcher's gear would have been great pluss they might have pulled out the sliding throw down getting bonus points.
Making your own pitching machine. top speed, ball movement, how easy to reset. Could all be judged
You guys gotta do homemade bases so that Eric can make concrete bases
Honestly hope Adam is ok. Looks like he was literally bleeding from his mouth. I was hoping they’d do a DIY catchers gear but that was definitely my biggest worry.  Except for Eric. I never worry about Eric. His pain is my enjoyment 😂
SO funny seeing everyones wives in these looking PISSED OFF about bro arts and crafts. Forget who it was but someone used a pot to cook like tar in the kitchen in one of these vids, and I just knew they were going to get reamed by the wife after lol.
Eric exposed tosh’s mask in the IMG coach live ABs video three months ago 👀🤯
You love to see the king of backwards ks making more elite content
The next one do homemade bases
Home made elbow guard and shim guard
Home made cleats next I want to see Eric make concrete cleats
Bro Adam is kanyas fucking dad
This is an awesome video next homemade video could be homemade batting gloves,homemade batting grip,and homemade cleats
the video i’ve been waiting for 😍😍
Next make your own cleats
Eric is such aa genuine thrill to watch
Day 1 of asking y’all to invent a new pitch
What dies bauer think of this
They should make hitting gear like elbow guards or leg guards
09:52 Not me thinking Tosh was spinning the camera around to his wife and instead getting a Kevin.
Make homemade training bats or equipment
Somehow Eric will find a way to get folded catching a baseball
you should do where you split into tweams of 3 (or more) and have a 3000 dollar budget each and try to make everything for a baseball game
ERIC IS CONTENT
Another banger!
Make homemade jocks.
Idc what yu guys think of tosh but him and Eric basically run this channel And for someone who had 50$ to spend and to win. #thegreatestever
sup with eric an concrete  loool
I hate the guy in the green dont bring him back
Thank you so much for doing what I asked😊
You guys should rate the cheapest catchers gear
Can the next challenge put a restriction on Eric to not be able to use concrete so we can actually see what he’s able to do with these?
Ngl Adam kind of looks like a ninja turtle 🐢
Kev got that dog in him
Eric, we need a “King of Concrete” tshirt
You guys should make everything you need for a game and play a game in it
Next make a home made batting helmet
Yall videos top tier idk how yall dont even have 1 million subscribers
Next up: homemade cleats? I'm sure Eric would be excited to do some cardio in concrete cleats.
This was fun to watch 🔥👏
Can’t wait until Trevor comes back in the off season
That is what she said
Please like this comment. You guy should play Wii Sports Baseball. That will be hilarious.
Y’all should play baseball with your homemade equipment
Kevin is the goofiest bozo ever
Make home made arm guards
eric needs to use rebar for his concrete
FivePoints gear lookin like Reptile from the old Mortal Kombat games
Homemade cups
I hate how tim is so serious about it
You should make homemade pitching machine Eric world still get folded Joking love you king of juco
You guys should make cleats next
Now to homemade baseball field and then in a different video play a full game with all the homemade stuff
Eric’s gear looks like a frozen pepperoni pizza
Eric can buy a whole lotta dumb shit with 3 hundo...
Ofc Eric’s good at math
12:58
4:59
Jesus loves you all
Just get a bunch of spray foam and plastic dip or carbon fiber . Glue section
could we see one without eric using concrete 😭🙏🏾
Erick casually drinking alcohol out of no where 😭
Before watching this video, Eric is gonna use concrete.
Homemade cleats next
Sims is pure content
If they haven’t made their own fielding glove yet we already know what direction Eric will be going lol
456
Eric sim, king of concrete
Adams for sure bounced way higher in the blocking stage
I love how Kevin just wears his gear like everywhere even in the umpiring video🤣
The concrete keeps going from bad to worse 😂😂😂😂😂
12:07 - Eric’s nuts.
Concrete 😂😂😂😂
my stomach hurts  from laughing so much .... i cant
Eric and concrete is my dream couple
Episode idea in the next build battle everyone uses concrete but Eric
Make your own batting gloves
Home made baseball field from Sim is gonna be great
bro the fact tosh somehow won is wild
i don’t know why but eric breaking the cart made me laugh so hard
Now make homemade nut cups
Kevin is taking catch me outside a little too literal
7:39…. We got some whattttt?????
LOVE THIS SERIES OF STUFF ITS AMAZING
Bro where is cole
Adam cringed me out everytime he came on camera. Id love to not see him on the channel going forward.
eric is a concrete bandit  new merch lmaoooo
Eric walked out at LSU today with 4 bats and still couldn't hit shit with any of them😂
new idea use all the homemade item if you have them still and do a homerun derby
Momentum is GOING CRAZY!
best yt in the world bro like every vid is such a w dude
My stomach literally felt like it would explode. I just ate and completely full. O joy, o pain😅
Hey my dad works for rapid set concrete. Sick.
😂😂😂😂
Jesus Loves You. Romans 10:9
do a homemade catchers mit
I feel like for this you could literally just use cut up buckets, sponges for padding, and some zip ties to hold pieces together.  The curve on the buckets would make decent shinguards and the flat sections on the bucket would make a decent chest protector
If Eric uses his 🧠 one time and uses his knowledge he will kick a$$ but he is obsessed with cement
For a video you should use all of your home made gear and play a three inning game
You have to make your own cleats
King of concrete
they should do a video of the gang playing an entire game with their home-made gear.  home made bat, home made gloves, home made baseball XD
Adam got the out on the last part cause the cart didn’t touch home plate
Eric had me dying this whole video 😂
Eric for god sake please stop with the concrete.  Its never gonna work.
They should make their own cups and have the cast from Jackass test them 😂
Eric mixing the concrete in a box is so unhinged 🤣
I dont care what these videos show concrete is always the answer
I don’t then Eric will ever get that concrete don’t work like that
you guys should make your own nutty buddy
How is it possible i literally can never even imagine what Eric is trying to do
Concrete content!
What’s with Eric and concrete
We need homemade elbow guards and let Eric test them 😂
I love how Eric is always so bad at these every time lol
Y’all should do homemade cleats
Eric and concrete don't mix....
Do homemade baseball hats or batting gloves
Eric gyat that dumpy
At this rate, they'll be able to equip a whole baseball team with made-up gears.
My man with the Wii edit. Keep killing it with the Nintendo memes, Kev.
Eric is king of concrete now
We need a game of all the home made things 😭
You should make homemade elbow or shin gaurds
Do homemade batting gloves
Shout out to Scrub Parents
28:16 is eric’s tinder profile 😂
Videos you guys should keep doing these videos
This is my favorite video of all time 😂
I love the
Next video everyone has to incorporate an item that someone else chooses in their build.   Ultimate series where you have to build your entire baseball bag, glove, bat, helmet and everything you need to play.
New video idea that would blow up would be making your own cleats
are we not gunna talk about Eric holding a straight bottle of jack Daniels?
Maaaaan the ball straight to the neck got me crying hahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahaha this is the best baseball content in the world. Keep it up guys! We love y’all.
Homemade cups
The Kevin when over budget lol Adam literally gave Tosh his chest protector
LMAO  I love you Eric Sim
You guys are content machines🔥🔥🔥
You should play a game with all the home made stuff
Two minutes!! LMAO
day 12 of asking for homemade elbow guards
Kevins the best 😂 " i got the dawg in me"
We should make a league where everything is just entirely made by Eric
I walked into this video thinking no way Eric is gonna use concrete on his catchers gear again after it fails every time and here i am again 🤦🏾‍♂️
Sim needs to give the concrete a rest.
I been waiting for an other one of this you guys are my favorite baseball YouTubers
Eric, I saw you in a picture with one of those nights kid and did you win?
Do cleats
Kevin got a shorty?
I’m so happy for the guy that’s been commenting on every video asking for this
we need homemade baseball batting gloves
Eric i think it's time to forfeit the concrete lol
Kevin and Tosh having the two lowest budgets and finishing as the top two show that they are the smartest and most creative guys on the Momentum team.
Eric drinking Jack Daniels from the bottle while Adam is getting hit in the face is pure comedy.
23:54 😂😂😂
Evo shield guards next
The random Home Depot worker sees Kevin walking in in full catchers gear: “Oh no, it’s them again.”
Eric needs to be a judge because his taste in gear is immaculate
Easily the best one yet😂😂😂
That was fye 😂
Gotta make your own cleats soon
No way Kevin is walking around the store in catchers gear
The commitment to concrete is legend. Quikrete hook this guy up!
😮
I want someone to look at me the way Eric looks at concrete
By far one of my most favorite videos we’ve done. Glad I got to be the judge for this 😂😂
this was the greatest vid ever
I love these videos!!! Sim dedicated to concrete is hilarious!!!
Eric looks like he had the $50 budget. Every idea he has involves concrete 😂
love how eric pigeon holed himself into concert, especially being a previous catcher
Eric js dinking Hennessey like water😂
You guys should do homemade catchers mitts next
Eric Sim: King of Catching
Nice to see Adam from five points videos
Eric loves his concrete
They need to have Adam on more often
Day 32 of asking for homemade cleats
I know it’s his a thick, but the concrete looks a getting dumb. The fact that Eric was the pro athlete kind of sums up baseball 😆
Attaboy Adam lol sticking in there 😅 hope to see more of yall's fellow creators given opportunities to be dorks with ya, it's fantastic content.
Kev got that DOWG in him
I got a Jack Daniels add right when it showed Eric holding the bottle haha
Eric: good at math, bad at driving  Fitting them stereotypes   Jk, glad you’re ok:)
I love Tosh’s chuckle laugh 😂
How has Eric not learned about rebar yet?
Poor Eric, can't win ever I feel bad ngl
Where did cole go
Man i wasn't expecting Adam to be as old as he is
Adam should have just bought a helmet for a hockey goalie
I want to see what Eric’s mind will do… no concrete challenge
"You were a professional vatcher so..." "Thats not. That has nothing to do with it." Gotta love the King!
Eric is just a content machine lmfao
I literally saw like 5 ads about  AG1
Lets gooo I watched the other homemade videos and today i was thinking they should do this
Eric 🟰bunt king
as always momentum is back with another banger
Question for Eric.  When the school bus picked to up when you where younger, was it a long bus or a shorter bus?  🤣  Rock on dudes 🤘😎
This was hilarious. Could not stop laughing. Great video!
yes beuno candy is the best choclate known to man
Day one asking for them to make homemade batting gloves
Eric is so lazy when it comes to these videos lol I love it he half asses every one and it makes the videos so much better because he somehow wins
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOREVER after that one comment I made like 5 months ago 😂
soooo hang on, Tosh goes over budget and has to have stuff taken out instead of being punished with negative points, Kev goes over budget, wins but then gets screwed by the -5 points punishment? Doesn't seem right to me
Hopefully more people can respect catchers duty’s
need Eric in the full concrete gear, hit with the concrete bat. LIFT BIG
Kevin’s rush hour reference was top notch 😂
We need to have a part two NEEEEEEEEEED
Do protective equipment like leg guards,elbow guards, ect…
Make  nuttie buddy’s for the boys
What ate they gonna make now, mounds, bases?
Y'all should make homemade cleats and homemade batting gloves
You should make homemade leg and arm guards
they should make homemade cups
Hi
Bro I was dead at 19:20
In my heart Kevin won .1 for every dollar over the budget
Nutty buddy next
Eric’s concrete fetish 😂
Eric always kills me🤣
need homemade cups next
Scrub daddy on shark tank they came up big time from before they went on show. Probably 8 figure company easy
How about homemade pitching machine
Eric commitment to physical comedy is the funniest part of every video 😂
Eric should’ve put scrub mommy’s on the inside
“How’s the neck?” Had me dying. I was coughing up a lung laughing so hard
Am I the only one thinking Kevin should put his chest protector upside down
Can Eric get a gig off at old us Chapman?
They be screwing Eric over
Just sitting here laughing my ass off. These videos are 🔥🔥🔥
What does eric do with the rest of the concrete
Tell Eric Trevor would have done better
you guys should do home made cups😂😂 I mean you all don't care about injuries haha
Finally we’ve been asking for so long 😄
batter protection next?!?
Gotta admire Eric’s commitment to the concrete
Eric is going to mess up
King of Juco=Master of concrete
Bryce Ks dad owns scrub daddy lol
Eric makes me clap and jiggle all day 😊
“Eric genuinely believes that making catching gear out of concrete is a good idea.” Haha love your content guys and especially the king of singles Eric Sim
Some guy was asking for a while and he got the video
He always making things out of concrete😂
VIDEO IDEA: you could make homemade batting gloves and test them to see which one is best.
ya’ll should do making homemade caps
@25:49 is easily the funniest thing I’ve seen in a while lol 😂
Best video idea yet
Jesus, when Eric was cutting that box with a sharp ass utility knife right at him… that gave me the sweats.
In the future dont go shopping at the same.  I think we would all like to see the suprised reactions when no one knows what the others are using.
the Momentum x Bald collab is something I never thought I would see, but is a pleasant surprise
All of Eric’s builds fail 😂
Everyone go to 12:06 you're welcome
some one called it in the last home made gear video
We must get eric sponsered by sponge mommy🤣🤣🤣
you guys are just...awful at using tools and crafting things lol but it is entertaining
We need to see Eric get dunked on more
Alright, Eric needs to stop with the concrete bit.  It's becoming too predictable.  Love you guys, though!  Just no more concrete lol
I’m liking Eric’s new workout routine in these series. Just put concrete everywhere and you have yourself weighted vests, helmets, etc. great sweat from what I’m seeing.
Eric just wastes the budget on bullshit!!! 😂😅😂😅
Bruh you guys are going to make home made nutty butty cups next
You guys should do make your own pitching mounds
Glad yall are working with 5points!!!
I luv u
*_"It’s actually very tasty… considering how healthy it is for you"_* That qualifier at the end kind ruins the statement. Lol
GOD BLESS
My life is so simple. Momentum uploads a new video I click I like #lifesmallbunttheball
do umpire next
You guys should do homemade cleats or cups
25:47 this look says, I’m not happy rn and is this worth it
I remember talking to Cole on stream about this!
Eric is a content machine.
I am VERY confident I could make something better than any of them with like $150 max lol
we need homemade pine tar
Where's Cole?
I haven’t seen the video yet but I’m excited to see Eric makes his gear out of concrete 😂
The concrete commitment is priceless.
Next in line.....homemade batting gloves if it hasn't already been done!
They should make their own cleats
when the judge called Eric a professional catcher I had to stop the video....what did I miss ?
the good thing about eric putting concrete on everything is it always bring a shit ton of entertainment
what's ya'll editing software?
it is funny Tosh said “did we lose Eric” but it is basically impossible to miss him
Eric finally winning a round was wholesome
as soon as i saw the title i thought how the hell is eric gonna use concrete for this but he never fails to try it😂😂😂
Are we not gonna talk about Eric just having Jack Daniels
What's the deal with Eric's obsession with concrete 😂
W
He representing Burlington sockpuppetsssssss
Eric’s gear is definitely gonna fail.
love erics concrete comedy
Eric, bro, concrete is not the way. Gotta love the confidence.
Make your own batting gloves
Kev in the catching gear in Home Depot made my day 😂
eric has been in love with concrete since the gym
THE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAT HAVE UPLOAD AGIN ME HAPPY
eric could have bought a can of great stuff spray foam insulation and he would have won.
Can y’all make a sliding mit
Fivepoints again. What a treat!
Do cleats with like baserunning, stealing, fielding, etc. would love to se Eric trip every 5 secs cause his shoes are to heavy
It was 4 minutes into the video that I realized Kevin was wearing catchers gear in Home Depot
Oh no
Kevin is like the child in the group
Build a home made pitching machine!!!!
Homemade cleats
It always amazes how Eric and how dumb he is was able to build his platform. Hey good for him lol
Thank u for a great 30 min vid
Eric is the Oakland A's of challenges
Who's the Gandalf guy?
Next make cleats and batting gloves
Scub daddy honestly would sponsor you lol
“We made our own nutty buddy” has to be next
Dudeeee! Shutout to that indestructible gear by Eric, Even broke the car with that tackle 😂 i'm diying
Eric and concrete is a better love story than Twilight xD
It’s iconic that my fav channel posted this on my moms birthday
BALD
Can't wait for homemade cleats, protection gear, and batting gloves
Eric looking like he is wearing a frozen pizza as a chest protector
12:07
we still wonder why women live longer than men i died laughing watching this video and eric chose to put 100 pounds of concrete on himself lmfao
I've been waiting on this one since the started the homemade series!!! 😂🤣
Its sad to see someone who knows so little about concrete use it every challenge.
Catcher gear is pricey - reminds me of pedal boards- how I recommend people buy them instead of making their own
🤣🤣🤣Adam got his ass whooped by the ball😂😂
This looked as fun as it was. Well except the part where I wore a ball to my face and neck.
can you make homemade cleats next
You guys should have to build a youth baseball team
To the one dude who was being an ass to the guy asking for these every video wya now?
wow they actually listened to the guy in the comments who recommended this idea
It’s time for the team to have an intervention about Eric’s concrete addiction
Lmao. If it wasn’t clear before, eric is definitely team COE
Day1 of asking to make a homemade batting helmet
Day 1 of asking to make homemade batting gloves
Homemade bases
Right in Adam's apple
its so funny how eric always does concrete and always gets last place
Eric’s gear is the funniest shit ever. Top tier content
kevin that looks like a d protector :11:34
Bruh, the concrete will never die…😂
Is there anything Eric can't make with concrete
If Eric would of used chicken wire instead of cardboard he would of had a better chance.
You guys should make homemade batting gloves
My dream is to just see kevin on the highway driving his car in full catcher’s gear😂😂
LOL even Eric's catcher gear gets folded LOL
Y’all should do a batting glove one
Austin needs to be in front of the camera more often! His quips and his personality is fun and amazing and we need more of it!
The concrete armpit should have won
Batting gloves and cleats next!!
love these videos.  Eric and concrete hahahaha
Y’all are too funny, watching in the airport laughing my ass off
its always a great day when momentum posts
I got that dog in me got me dying

Concrete or die
Bro I commented this idea on one of there vids let’s goo they did it!
I love FIVEPOINT VIDS
Here before 1 million views
Eric had a big budget but still managed to make it look like trash.
Day 1 of asking for homemade umpire gear
I saw a comment when they made their own bats that asked for them to make their own catchers gear and they actually made it
You need to make your own Nutty Buddy’s…. BTW Eric’s will be made of concrete
12:06  Why even make catching gear with cake like that? Bro can just turn around, bend over, and catch just like that.
Sim is great for content. But I'd love to see him try once lol
Do homade bating gloves
King of concrete
“Let’s make the lightest shoe”  Eric : let’s use concrete
Hey Eric it’s kinder not bueno, bueno is just the name of the candy that kinder is selling
Making your own pitching "machines"?
Eric has this dumb obsession with concrete as ball equipment
I love the Home Depot employee coming up knowing them and asking why they keep letting them into the store
Say what you will, but nobody is charging home plate against the King of Concrete..
Lift small bunt the ball👍🏾🫣
Trevor?
eric gear was entertaining lol
Thank you for the amazing content. This channel never ceases to amaze me.
Hi

King Of JuCo? Nah king of concrete
Concrete always should win 💪
I cried multiple times from laughing. Fantastic content guys!
The nut shot lol
The whole crew looks like theyre gettin ready to raid in Rust.
King of concrete
Make your own elbow guards
Eric refusing to give up the concrete idea is too funny.
Eric shouldve used a toilet seat for the mask like he did with the homemade helmet
Eric found a Minecraft hack and made armor out of stone
w vid

That guy who kept asking is gonna be so happy now lmao
Please do more videos with Fivepoints vids!
Finally!!!
I am never sliding on Eric ever, I’m not trying to get that shelf treatment
Let's go a nuther one
How is it possible to Eric still get folded in a catching competition? 19:12

I’m surprised how tosh made his catcher gear with 50 dollar budget
Where's coleee
Now it’s time for home made cups
Eric a wild boy lol man s/o the the Kansas juco system lol he’s a product it shows lol
I don't know what Kevin is expecting everywhere he goes, but he stays ready
