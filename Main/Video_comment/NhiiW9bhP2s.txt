Whole album hard no kap but this the hardest song on that bihh (dont @ me}
If they Killas in the burbs then they goofy Only Guys getting money in the Suburbs is L.E.X, Flex Gang, And 15-4L them 15-4L boys own trucks, Real estate, Gas stations, Subway's niggas got real money. Them the only guys getting money in the suburbs HotBlock Got Entertainers They not street niggas They hoopers, Rappers Entertainment is what they do. Suburbs ain't no place to really be killa at. Once you go to the county jail or Illinois Prison for a body in the suburbs they going to Laugh at you because it's the suburbs so the only thing that makes Them Respect you is if you getting money Out there and your guys sending money to your books other than that whatever you doing In the suburbs don't get no respect. And CHICAGO aint shit it's the Literature that a person gets that makes them OFFICIAL. Without that niggas lames Foreal.

Young 🐐
21 i see you
Former Death Row Records Artist Timothy Lorenzo Hurd better known by his stage name ''TRO The Realist Out'' is considered to be a driving force on the West Coast. He knows being lyrical is not enough. You have to have the complete package. You have to look the part, act the part, and be the part. The girls have to love you and the guys have to want to be you. You have to have that swagger, energy, attitude and talent all combined into the perfect package to make today's rap star. And that's exactly what TRO is The Complete Package.
Thats my cuz look wettttem up

Survivor Remorse..🤔🤔.. Love that Herbo is speaking on it🫡!! To all my former street niqqas, It’s OKAY to move on from the hood!.. I’m talking gangs shii, drugs, toxic broads, criminality etc.. smmfh.. The point was to GET OUT and stay out!! Please don’t feel guilty cause you made it!! Everybody CANT GO!! Whether you go to school and get a trade, started a successful business, signed a record deal or earned a sports contract. Keep it moving fam and DONT look back.💯💯❤️

👑 GHerbo hit that shyt!!!
Sumthin in him? It's demon time, like it's mighty Morphin time. He's literally telling you something is in him, he can't say it straight out tho. Either he don't really know what he got in him, or he does and he knows the rules. Either way both tell you it's a demon. Stay prayed up out there. Jesus Christ is God
Y’all see 21

HERBOOO🔥🔥
These lakeshore cats gonna try to mess with jules cause we have feelings for eachother watch out for him with these stalkers hes not doing anything illegal or bad hes just shooting his shot to get with me. Thats what he means when he says I dont miss🖤  they have no legal right to attack him physically/verbally/legally for saying or choosing to move in that action as its legal but what is not legal is for the same group of sociopathic group stalkers who are stalking me to turn around and to be stalking jules or spencer as clearly they do not want contact with those people just as i dont and he wants them to stop conducting theyre actions of sociopathic group stalking including the gang stalking that has followed this issue too also stop. summer has no monarchy protection and political protection from andrea horwath or any of horwaths dirty politician friends/associates and being involved in provincial politics can not cover up for and excuse murder... murder is murder. Jules has never killed nobody so cant nobody take his music and art and twist it and involve it with any criminal activities. I do know that if any of these lakeshore sociopathic group stalkers who are involved in a certain social circle even think to go after him they are gonna be in much more legal headaches then they could ever imagine especially when i hear about it and catch word of it. Keep him safe and out of harms way please. -YuuDunno
