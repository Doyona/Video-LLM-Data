I saw one of those toxic waste bars in a corner shop the other day
Duuuuuude i remember kings bubble gum candy cigarettes, back in the early 2000's my grandfather would buy me a pack every time he went to the gas station across the street, those and the candy cigars  Funnily enough i grew up to hate cigarettes because my mom was and still is a smoker
we still have kinder surprise in eastern parts of europe 😏
I still don’t understand we have kinder eggs here in America, or is it the one with toys that are banned?
It wouldn’t be a UK festival if there weren’t a number of people locked motionless in place after ingesting horse tranquilliser, people’s jaws spinning like washing machines and hundreds of people covering their eyes that look like black holes with sunglasses and I wouldn’t be surprised if there is some hippy sippy floating about in those fields 😂😂
The editor did harry dirty with the “Trying not to laugh.”
kinder eggs are so common in astralia
we still have kinder eggs in Australia
Yo you’ve got past 300K likes.Ethan and Harry need to source the nuclear sludge
Sooo we reached the like limit?? Wheres the vid

i know im late to this but if u goo to the redbridge roundabout in london (ethan probably knows where this is) if u go to shop local you will be able to find the toxic waste sluge bars.
any body else notice @ExploringWithJosh trying the candy cigarettes
Them animal activists are mental. How tf do roadkill gummies get banned when actual meat doesnt. If I'm a kid eating a steak, im more likely to learn that killing animals is okay through that rather than through a cheaply made completely inaccurate gummy of a dead snake. Hell if anything a non-run over snake would be more like teaching kids its okay, that snake aint been run over yet. It's "still alive" rather than dead already and millions of kids around the world happily rip their heads off with their teeth - yet you don't see them going around peoples gardens hunting snakes to decapitate do you?  If you really think a shitty gummy snake is gonna tip the scale and cause a bunch of homicidal children then you're fuckin mental lmao. Kids can still learn about the law, and realise that animal abuse is illegal and no matter what your road kill gummy inferred, your not actually meant to run over every animal you see in the car you can't drive for another 10 years yet.
I’ve done the nose candy with a pixie stick
where can I buy??
number nine is fucking bullshit
Did Ethan and Harry eat that toxic sludge lead bar in the end?
Im here in 2023 wandering where this toxic waste video is at
300K LIKES ?

Dropping A Penny From The Empire State Building Is A 100 Mph..Somebody Is Not Surviving...Sorry Harry...
The bars taste grim I found a shop that sold them and had all the flavours
I love the Karl pilkington cameo
12:55 no way this guy said malAga
candy cigarettes arent banned in canada i have them all the time
Why're they shocked that the Toxic Waste Chew Bars have lead in them? They all have drank G-Fuel. Read the back of every tub. They literally have traces of lead in them lmao. You drink traces of lead with G-Fuel
How is it that vik did a level physics and has never heard of terminal velocity 💀
beanhsa
3:07
None of this is banned in the United States
I remember those stick's that were just sugar, THEY WERE DELICIOUS, and I would just eat them cause I'm not weird.
it'll hurt more than a penny dropped from just an inch above, but not anything K.O, O.H.K.O, or anything above.
Im suprised we havent banned chalk cuz my friend has snorted like 7 lines
They tocic waste chew bars are in Skegness on the summer lands caravan park get them from there
Some gas station near me sells candy cigarette’s
im waiting for the bars
I go to Spain every year and I heard the screams
Have they found the lead bar
Toxic waste isn't even that sour
7:18 if an animal gets hit by a car it was a stupid animal anyway
One bottle of hippy sippy along with 12 little hippy sippy pins is worth….$780….crap
Here's some advice for my minors put sugar a leaf gum and rap it up with tissue then rap the tissue up with paper it's exactly the same as a real cigerretes but it has a buff u get cancer faster
Fuck I’m eating a sludge bar right now fuckkk
you know what so funny while watching this video I was latterly eating one of the candies that was band
we used to do the same thing with sour patch kids sour powder thing as the kids with the lucas mexican stuff
Harry makes an excellent point you know
Still waiting on Harry and Ethan eating the toxic waist chew bar
In Australia us kids used to use FADS, they`re like hard musk sticks to pretend to smoke. We always used to think we were the coolest, especially when you took them to school because everyone would ask for them.
How’s the toxic wasted been banned if I ate it a few days ago?
the kinder thing is bs though because the chocolate on the kinder egg banged
I've had the chew bar's. I'm still alive
It’s been 2years and they still haven’t done a vid yet for the toxic munchies
300k likes
Harry’s comment on the kinder egg is right natural selection
Kinder eggs are S++++++++++++++++++++++++++
They need to get the toxic wast nuclear sludge bar cause they are weep past 300k likes and the don’t even need to source them because u can just by boxes of them on eBay for like a maximum of £15
Kinder eggs are still legal in Canada and India so if y’all want any go there 👍🏽
bro i’ve eaten a toxic waste bar
14:02 harry is right because a penny has terminal velocity of around 27 mph meaning it will only leave a bruise
I agree with Harry it was a stupid baby
3:06
Are we skipping over that they called 🇲🇽 South America?
A penny can't gather momentum, but with enough velocity and reduced area of impact, it definitely can do some serious damage to a man (or woman (or anything else idk (maybe even a dog) ) )
Bro they were over reacting with the Lucas Mexican candy I’m 13 and half my class got ahold of popcorn favoring and 3 of them snorted it
Imy grandma still makes them at her work and bring them to me
Famalam you can get toxic waste now I lighterly had some in a lesson the other day

I remember Lucas it was soooo good and I never knew it had led 💀
usa ban kinder egg but here in canada we still have it
Wonderballs😂😂

Not me watching this in 2023 while eating a Lucas candy
If anyone is curious, those bars do exist
Sidemen if you are still looking for a nuclear sludge chew bar I have sourced one off of a friend which I am willing to give.
the gum thing was on 1000 ways to die
This only makes me wonder what I'm eating now that will be banned in future for containing too much lead.
I've had the roadkill gummies and I'm glad I did before they got banned 😂
I’m lucky I have kinder eggs😂😂😂
So, we not gonna remind Harry and Ethan that it has now surpassed 300k likes? 6:31

Why don't they banned guns when so much people die from it but they banned kids candy
most of the bans were from stupid people not the brand  its kinda sad
Its already 4k
Iv said before and will say again, i think me and Harry would get on really well based on our similar opinions  I'm a bit older than you guys but I remember chocolate wrapped in rizla in what looked like fag packets, they looked a bit like roll ups but it was just the sugar sticks by the time I was about 11 or 12
Siuu
You can buy kinder eggs in Scotland

It gets really messy if you pop a gum on your face when you have beard and mustache! I did it once after growing beard, and it got really messy and gross! If was all over my beard and mustache! I had to wash my face with soap to get rid of the gum!! I never made a bubble from a gum after that!!😆
Any updates 😂
@12:43 tobz 😭😭😭
Get the chew bar
Hope y’all try the nuclear sludge bar. Great content love the channels for sidemen and the individual channels everyone has! Y’all need to brainstorm and do more with Logan and his crew and also maybe do a irl tinder with Mr.Beasts crew.

All have done evil “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23) The penalty for sin is hell (Revelation 21:8). Because of Gods love for us Jesus Christ came down from heaven to take the punishment for our sin on the cross in which he was spat on, beaten, mocked and laughed at.   Christ died for the sins of the world and The third day God raised him from the dead (Praise God). This was done so that those who believe on Christ will not perish (hell) but have life everlasting (heaven); be justified by Gods grace through redemption in Christ (John 3:16) (Romans 3:24).  The blood Jesus shed on the cross washes away our sin if we Believe in The Son of God and his finished work (ordained by God) on the cross. When this happens the believer receives the righteousness of Christ in place of their own unrighteousness (all sins are forgiven) and this makes them saved (going heaven) and they are born again as a Christian. (Romans 3:25-26)...
Let's be honest, you only came here again for Harry's line 😂

8:16 I see you, Harry. I see you.
A local petrol station near where I live sells the nuclear sludge bars, didn’t buy one after watching this vid 👍
Still wondering where that toxic waste bar is..
Spain are worried about one person dying while I live in New Orleans Louisiana USA and thousands have died walking in front of a float or the tractor driving the float during Mardi Gras
I remember we had a competition in grade 6 for who could eat the most warheads (super sour candy) I won that shit cuz sour stuff doesn't affect me but wow my mouth was bleeding so much, hurt soooo bad.
I didn't need the hippie sippy to show me how to do drugs or that they were fun. in middle school we snorted the sour sugar at the bottom of sour soother bags, if your kid knows about snorting and is curious, they're gonna find something to snort
Harry just move to Canada, we got kinder eggs with toys still
Uh you can buy those toxic waste bars in some places in England still lol
Amazon sell them
Oh
i remember once a corner shop sold kid cocaine which was a sugary powder
The nuclear waste bars are 30p online
The exploding gum was in a episode of 1000 ways to die and it was about a crackhead and dipped the gum in red phosphorus
umm to be honest some of my friends used to take [steal] the teacher's chalk and powdered it. and they used to make lines, roll up paper and you know the rest.... I've never done it but my friends say that it feels awesome, but i dont get it coz they are just inhaling Calcium carbonate which will damage their lungs! people are wired!
Those candy cigarettes arenmt banned in norway
yeah i’ve snorted dipdab powder before and the sugar stuff that comes off rainbow belts. it’s not a great idea tbh

When I was 5 I ate the sugarless haribos and the toilet looked like Cadbury chocolate left in the sun
I heard about the explosive gum thing from 1000 ways to die. The difference was that it was a meth head, who would be up all day and night cooking meth, and would be chewing gum and dipping it in citric acid while he worked. Then I guess at one point he fucked up and, boom.
I remember the toxic waste bars too sour 😂
get the sludge bars @SidemenReacts
Lucas was great I still have some

One time i ate one of those green rectangle containers of Warheads all at once (its a sour lolly, idk if y'all have them) and I couldn't eat for a day after that. Everything hurt my tongue. I couldn't taste without it hurting. The lolly's were good though. 2/10 wouldn't recommend.

Is the narrator the same guy in simple history YouTube channel
If you choke, got diarrhea, snorted or did any of this dumb stuff, that's just natural selection and you're probably gonna do worse anyway. Why the hell would you think eating a whole bag of anything wouldn't have effects? And the kicker, smokers were recorded to have had candy cigarettes when they were younger........so just because i smoke a cigarette you're gonna assume i didn't have a childhood? Bruh if candy cigarettes were a factor in my reason for smoking I'd be jumping for joy but sadly the world has worse things to offer
I agree with Harry. Let natural selection deal with the stupid kids. It's for the future of our nation lol
Hey 300k likes has happend , EAT TOXIC WASTE EAT TOXIC WASTE !!!!!!! ☣️☣️☣️🤢🤮🤢
where is the chewbar
The second one is indeed bullshit. If it's really banned, how can it be that we here in The Netherlands still can buy it?? So if people see this comment and want some? Come to The Netherlands
Citric acid is used in making some explosives but harmless alone, so they guy probably added other things that made an explosive mix without knowing, not added explosives instead
Be sure to believe, have faith and trust God and and repent of your sins so that when he comes back if you have been doing these you have been saved already.  and all sins are forgivable (except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.    and don't worship the antichrist when he comes he will force the world to worship and give them the mark of the Beast which doesn't let you go to Heaven.  And I'm not forcing you by the way God did give us free will 😎👍                                                     But it is better to know God before he comes back with wrath  And Jesus was nailed onto a cross because of our sins and he lived a perfect and sinless life and he isnt mad that we were the reason he died on the cross, after he died he was brought back to life and he wants us to put our faith in him and to trust his sacrifice so when we die we can enter Heaven.  And we can Know while we are still here. Don't let Jesus be a stranger to you. Don't let him   say "Depart from me for I do not know you"  But let him say   "Welcome home my good and faithful servant"  Have a Great day!  And sorry if I annoyed you. . And Dnt Cuss, listen to music with sin in the lyrics (killing, sex before Marriage and other sins) Don't watch porn or hentai or post sexual stuff or do/say homosexual stuff or be homosexual. They're sins  but they're forgivable but just because a sin is forgivable doesn't mean you should commit it that's abusing Gods grace/forgiveness or it could be. The same applies for masterbation and sexual dances, sexual acts and sex before Marriage and sex just for pleasure and sex with people that aren't your spouse. And winking is a sin. And hating people is a sin and you need to forgive others to be forgiven and cheating is a sin even on tests .

We have kinder eggs here in America but I remember being in Germany when I was a boy and it was my favorite klcandy because you get a toy you put together like one time ingot a soldier with a parachute and the only reason I remember that is because I loved that soldier but I live in America now tho
Lead will kill you so theres a reason we dont allow lead past a certain level

It’s an old video but how do they not know every object has a terminal velocity  when falling, the air resistance slows down the falling object and it will stop speeding up so something like a penny will not be able to kill you no matter how high it is
I ate a whole can of that Toxic Waste candy when I was a kid, and it was delicious
I've had toxic waste chew bar in 2021!!!!!!!!

On the topic of candy: In Switzerland there was this chocolate sweet called "Mohrenkopf" in german, it means "blackamoor's head" or in french they call it chocolate head.  Think they changed it now for obvious reasons, but its a good treat, just a an awful name.

The respect levels I have for Tobi just sky rocketed. His reaction to the blatant blackface is not one of outrage but disappointment, he doesn't express it in a way that creates a angry/hyped up vibe. Which is just such an unbelievably mature thing. If I was him I woulda rented for like 10 mins
there is a cornerstore near me that sell the toxic waste chew bars so that a bunch of rubbish.
Wait does England not have Kinder egg?

smarties were banned in my school because kids were snorting them like coke
they made kinders in the U.S but you split in half the peel the plastic off both sides one side has the toy and one side has choclate with two hazelnut balls with cream in the middle
In my school kids used to crush up smarties and arrange them into lines. After they sniffed them they would sneeze and cough but then do it again...
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Oh wow "if your baby chocks on a toy it was a stupid baby anyway" 😂😂😂😂😂

I think the UK still bans the import of  chickens from the US because between 5 and 10 percent of chickens produced the the US are washed with cold water with a small amount of chlorine.   It’s strange because  the European Food Safety Authority says this treatment poses no threat to consumers, yet they stick to the ban  anyway.   With some products, it’s more about protecting a market from competition than concern over consumer’s’  health.
GET ONE HARRY
Since Kinder  didn’t care about the market enough to change anything, Yowie got in  after making a sort of substitute for for Kinder Surprise that changed the  packagiing a  little bit,  just enough to legally get around the FDA  regulations, and now they own the entire American market.
15:13 wtf we still have these in sweden istg. Lmao

Well I have had the haribo gummy bears
whheres thhe nuclear sludge
Ok, I'm not proud of this but here it is, at a school trip we stayed in a juvenile hotel, I'm in Switzerland so there are these candies called Traubenzucker, they are supposed to give you energy for sports because its sugar from fruit. It comes in the compacted tablet, my friend had a bunch of them and we were I'm 6th grade... The entire grade was doing lines of it when the teacher wasn't around. One kid did a lot of that sugar powder and got sick, on the way back my friend being the dumbass that he was tried to do a line of cocoa powder in the backseat of the van... Edit: Switzerland also sells candy cigarettes at festivals and they have powdered sugar as smoke, I once pranked my dad with it, it didn't go as well he was unimpressed and not laughing...
All these candies are dangerous. Thank goodness this was all canceled.
This was no doubt the greatest intro of all time, hands down. Incredible
fuck off Tobi, nobody likes you
It can’t just be me that doesn’t think toxic waste is sour but rainbow belts are 😂

slugges for the sidemen
Toxic wastes are in AUSTRALIA
I just want to point something I noticed out. 8:10 "Mexican Candy" from "South America".
14:52 You're doing it wrong (I hope to God), you're supposed to *"suckle"* the red part until it completely melts in your mouth, only then can the candy truly be considered spent/eaten. 15:13 I used to kinda chew those back in my younger days, they tasted tastelessly bad (too much powder, thus it crumbled in your mouth like hell). Spat them right out of my mouth.
Whe have kinders in Europe
I still eat the Lucas candy

i agree, if the kid chokes on the toy in a kinder egg that is just natural selection at work. i live in canada and ive had kinder eggs ever since i was like 3 or 4 and never even thought about eating the toy. dont know how the parents didnt teach this to their kids.
did u notice that most of these candies were cancelled because someone ate them wrong or added something to it to make it wrong or just ate too much? it's not the company's fault its ur\ ur child's fault.

To be fair though, as a kid, I used to always put the entire plastic toy continer of the Kinder eggs in my mouth to eat all the chocolate that remained on it. It's a wonder I never chocked on it.

EAT THE LED EAT THE LED EAT THE LES
Toxic waste cant kill I had an entire pack in a day
i’ve done this on another video but may aswell comment it again :) *cracks knuckles*  like Harry said a penny being dropped from the empire state building won’t kill someone since it can’t reach enough velocity to kill anyone, the pull of gravity has a higher impact on heavier mass than light weight, which is why a car will drop faster than a feather, if you were to drop a penny from mount everest and drop a penny from a roof in comparison there would barely be a difference, since the weight of the penny would balance out with the pull of gravity and would reach a top velocity very quickly.  this is similar to the acceleration a car, just because you do it for a longer period of time doesn’t mean your car will go any faster, at one point you’ll hit the limit
the thumbnail: toxic waste can kill     me: i eat toxic waste religiously
WE ARE AT 300K!!

Not being awful but if you’re stupid enough to give your kid a kinder egg and not watch them then it s your own fault. Also what kid thinks, OOH YELLOW PLASTIC THING GOTTA EAT IT! If they think that they are far too young for kinder eggs anyway.

At 12:40 it is blackface, however in Spain it is not interpreted like most of western society in a negative aspect, it’s not for comedy but quite literally becoming someone different as the Reyes magos did originate from Palestine and Ethiopia, so they were typically black. It is blackface, but it is not to mock but to celebrate the coming together of the wise men in Bethlehem, one of them is black so they adopt the role but don’t get me wrong it is never ever mocking black people and is never seen in that way, unlike places where blackface was used to mock and make fun of black peoples like on American stages. Unfortunately it is a different culture, and if you cannot understand it don’t express your interpretation of the culture onto theirs.
There are 300k likes can you please do it

It's the if your baby is gonna choke on a toy  it was a stupid baby anyway I am dead
13:01 Harry just vibing
The thing about Kinder eggs really is bullshit. I grew up eating them all the time and every kid knows you just break the egg open (and it was more fun if you were able to perfectly break it in half) and eat the chocolate before opening the toy container. Every kid I knew ate them like all the time and never once have I heard of anything bad happening, ever. Don't want to sound insensitive, but if your kid somehow does choke on the toy, then you clearly weren't paying attention and didn't see the actual warning on the box.
Vic you screwed up bro, you saying how a 20p is going to kill someone when you drop it off of the Empire State Building but in a more recent vid about the 7 star hotel called someone out saying it wouldn’t it might just hurt 😂😂😂

For the toxic waste,  It says that it was 3x the regulations of 0.1 ppm, which is 0.3 ppm, but the regulations for the water in my area is 15 ppm. So realistically I am probably consuming more lead through my water than I ever would have through those things
We need more likes!

We still have kinder eggs in Canada
You can get the toxic waste bars on amazon
This guy is making seem Pakistan bad by saying toxic waste candy bar was produced in it when it was produced by a western company in 3 countries not only in Pakistan. And to add to that I have never seen this candy in a common store nor seen someone eating it in Pakistan in my life. Should be careful with the words. Smh
Lol I’ve had that Lucas sweet before, my Spanish teacher (who is British XD) brought it from Mexico lol. So Urm.... epic.

When tobi saw the black facing I almost died 😭
Kinder eggs are still sold in the US but they are just different. So one half is chocolate and the other it's a toy, so technically the toy isn't in the chocolate
Candy cigarettes are banned in Canada.
I have the toxic waste bar in my corner shop 😳
Anyone else try toxic waste?

Tobi don't do it don't do it don't do it seriously
I've heard somewhere that throwing a penny off a building won't kill someone cause the penny will reach the maximum velocity and will continue to fall at that maximum velocity until it hits the ground. I don't believe it can kill anyone but I can be completely wrong on this
Jj is fat
PLEASE GO READ THE SUGAR FREE GUMMY BEAR REVIEWS ON AMAZON. COULD BE A VIDEO. I WANT JJ AND ETHAN IN THAT VIDEO!!!!!!!
When i lived in Spain I had a kinder egg every time I went to the store. Then I moved to us and couldn’t find any

Parents are wetoddid
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

Wait a minute  The kid who died from gum was on 1000 ways to die Only OGs will remember
Roadkill!
anyone else used to crush up candy sticks and snort them
The reason they removed leaded fuel was because of the quantities of lead flowing into the plants and animals we eat. In Africa and China, where leaded fuel is still used, the food from there is polluted... chocolate is a big source of lead in diets.
Tbh nobody can chat shit about squashies they’re the shit fr
Everyone sniffs dip dab
POV: ur mad cause they used candies
Kinder eggs are banned?
I literally just bought some chewy that resemble a ciggaret and it blows out powder but it's in the UK only

Them toxic waste bars were still available where I live in the uk they might not be now but they were in January of 2020 they were actually really nice I'm actually shocked they were banned because i used to go buy like 10 on the way home from school and eat them over the next couple of days afterwards.

My tongue reacted with that weird sour feeling just looking at the picture
Lol, Toby's the only one that reacted to the blackface.😂😂
Tobi's reaction to the blackface is so subtle, man was trying so hard not to say something
The fact that I had half of these 🤦‍♂️
You can get 10 of those bars for £3 lads, get on it pleaseee
It’s almost at 300k, if you haven’t already, like the vid. It costs you literally nothing
Myth busting bog 😂

Ok and you can crush smarties and smoke the dust
According to the TV show 1000 ways to die, the guy that dipped his chewing gum in explosives actually had a chemist degree and he was making meth in his basement. He was also using meth, so since he was on meth he would chew on the same chewing gum for several days straight and keep dipping it in citric acid, until he accidentally dipped in the explosives that he would use to make the meth with and blew his face off. You are welcome.

Ban normal toxic wastes and i'll ban you myself.
Wait i had those candy cigarettes like 3 or 4 years ago, they‘re banned now? I also got some from my friends when i was a kid and look at me today... never smoked a cigarette. So these things don‘t get children into smoking. If you don‘t want to start smoking - you won‘t.
Wow in the first seconds harry dropped the truth HARD!!!
"i feel like I've done this at some festivals"
For context, for the story at 11:08, he was making meth and used citric acid for his gum, but reached for another ingredient for the meth, and the combination caused an explosion.

few hours and we already have 200k likes so get ready bois
Really random but the last react reminded me of a school friend when Ethan said he had a friend who actually tried smoking the candy sticks. I had a friend who smoked half a gummy worm, he was actually inhaling smoke after puffing it while it was on fire. The next day he didnt make it to school, we found out a couple days later that he was in the hospital because he had a coughing fit that almost killed him cause he had no air in his lungs from coughing so much. Please if u ever have the not so bright idea to consume candy any other way then its intended DONT do it. It could lead to serious repercussions
Ethan looks so depressed ever since the sidemen spending video
They sell the toxic waste bars in a shop I live by in Blackpool town centre
Bloody hell don't be eating lead for 300k likes🤣

Ukranian Bubblegum kid was in the show “1000 ways to die” I remember him watching the show about 6 or 7 years ago...so that’s probably where Harry recognizes the kid from
The gum guy could of put the gum in tannerite. It's a explosive powder that needs force to explode. And atleast in the us would can but tannerite from local stores and you can get the ingredients from big chain stores!

Come on boys were halfway there
15:11 that impression 😂😂
Big up the like button guys
2:14 Harry saying Oh What just reminds me of the guy who found out that they put coke in burgers
OK
No one:
On the series "1000 ways to die" it actually explains how the guy with the explosive bubble gum died. I can't fully recall it but he was working on some explosive stuff, I think he planned something evil, and always had a stack of acid on the table, where he would occasionally put his gum into, to get that taste. He then once put it in the wrong powder and BOOM!
Exploring with josh!!!
You better munch on some lead soon.
No one:  Ethan: Bro Get this man a bro counter
Y'all exposed JJ like that?
I've done the sniffing lines one

8:02 notice how on the sign on the left the letter S in Slaughter is covered lmao
So kinder eggs have a container that has the toy inside of it and if you shake it makes a noise and also it has several warnings in the adverts and packets also and the toys explicitly say there is a toy inside and warn you and say it is a choking hazard and if American kids still choke it’s natural selection at that point like come one what do Americans not understand moderation or to not 1 bite something bruh how clapped can kids be also Americans you don’t ban guns which kill 10000’s of people yearly and kinder eggs kill less than 10 people a year bruh Americans fix up your laws they make no sense
5:01 that joke is soo much funnier if u r a real batman fan. If u know u know

Mate, in Norway we have a sugary powder candy called «hockey powder», and a sour version is basically just white powder, and it was popular to snort the stuff back in the day. Shit never got banned, because everyone knew it was just for fun. Nobody took it serious, and the candy is good af.

If you eat white bread, then shut the fuck up about censourship. Sending somebody to hell requires feelings, and feelings are the opposite of liberty.

12:40 tobi is the only one who notices the blackface

I ate one of them bars as I was watching
U can buy the cigarets in sweden
You can still buy the toxic waste bars...
How did Harry out smart vik at the end, I’m disappointed vik didn’t know that pennies can’t kill from that height

"Baby's are stupid" according to harry   LOGIC
Harry:boys noooooo
I need confirmation that Tobi's sigh was his him clocking the black face cause im screaming here ahahahah
The Lucas is still in America you can find it anywhere
the lucas candy moment reminded me when my friend snuffed a line of kool aid and faked a overdose
who can eat the most toxic waste would bang as a moresidemen vid or even main channel
The Lucas candy one isn’t much worse than what people do with smarties by crushing them snorting them and sometimes smoking them.
Innnnn
“If your baby’s gonna choke on a toy, it was a stupid baby anyway.” *HARRY THAT’S NOT HOW THAT WORKS—*

Wow Harry really just outsmarted vik
big up to the editor! XD
Get this to 300k, I need to watch them consume LEAD SLUDGE!
Harry is right it will bounce especially from the Empire State Building I’m pretty sure it’s because of some aero dynamics and gravity so if it falls for very long time reaching it’s limit and it will feel like something just tapped ur head                    Random thing in science I learnt :) 🖕
I got a selection box of toxic waste on Christmas. it had nuclear sludge in it. So i don't think its banned
I actually got a pack of candy cigarettes but I was like 7 so I just ate em instead of smoking them😂😂
I snorted dibdap sherbet once....
I beg they get 300k likes for that bar xD
bruh
Bro the Lucas candy is amazing and yeah snorting it was more of a dare at school
I eat toxic waste🙄
Oh no when Tobi realized the people in the pic painted themselves black. For a moment I was surprised they didn't notice and than Tobi let out a sign💀
Hello from pakistan 😂
They talk about how much lead is in some of the food but then we used to have lead pipes in all the houses in the UK mainly built before 1970 now it is banded. Probably the reason for the lead is the water system around the factory
When you're eating a Kinder Egg while watching this.....
11:01 the reviews 😂
We Now know jj is a undercover sweats eater
Harry trashed the baby so hard it's 7 ft under a garbage pile
Bro the Lucas candies still sell in food city in my town lmao

12:41 I wonder if Tobi noticed that they used black face
U r British so its  sweets bro
Honestly in some of the candies its the parents fault of not teaching them or controlling or looking after them
I remember being kid a and eating a 5 pence coins , honestly I thought it was normal . Anyone else ?
This one has mad bants. One of the better oned
4 shortest sidemen r low key funny
The kinder eggs are still the same in Norway lmao
Harry trying not to laugh was me when they said that in the video as well

Behz is so confident, kinda hot if u asked me
Any other Americans miss Wonder Balls? 🥺
Harry could get Hundrets of thousands upvotes on r/unpopularopinion
The fact only Tobi realized the black face while everyone else didnt
Vik is hilarious
Ethan to your question about the pennies of the empire state building, myth busters have done something like this uses the hight of the Eiffel tower and all it causes is a minor flesh wound so bog no it does not cut people in half.
Ethan: "Just like dad, Those cigarettes wont work on me"
Btw they have the toxic waste bars in my local shop
16:37 Harry Finally laughed!!!

Ops
The throwing of pennies over cars is actually done in India when someone gets married. I was actually standing behind the car and suddenly the coins started raining from nowhere.
4:00 tbf it does say not for 0-3 and if they’re older than that and it caused them to choke etc then that’s on the parent for not teaching their kid about how to eat the chocolate

That explosion gum is definitely osamas
harry needs to stop incriminating himself

Omg I remember the sugar cigarettes when I was a kid! I used to just pretend to be cool and ‘smoke’ through them like Toby said hahah
As a mexican those lucas powder smacked
I can source you 👀🤫
Ethan can u go live on twitch and read fan fiction 10:25 was a vibe
dropping a penny off of the empire state building, it can reach terminal velocity and kill someone on impact. however, the chances of this happening are slim because the penny ould get carried away by the wind
When Lockdown's done, Canada still has Kinder Eggs for everyone that doesn't have access to them
Harold is a lad u could go on a night out with

"Don't take the toys out of kinder eggs" - Harry
I loved candy cigs.
I hope they munch on the sour candy that would be a priceless reaction :D
I hate ethan
I live in Canada and candy cigarettes are awesome but it doesn’t make people wanna smoke
So that's why jj drop all that cash on that girl in tinder date
They should react to Steven Tries Videos
In my country they still sell gum cigarets POG
my brother literally got a kinder egg like 2 days ago

"If your baby's gonna choke on a toy, it was stupid baby anyway"  Thanks, Harry. I think i just found my 2021 life motto
The bully who takes youre lunch  Me: :))))))))
5:29 Isn't that the person who ate live creatures like octupi and she is making that face because of toxic waste (It could just be someone who looks similar, don't take my word for it)
HEYYY WHERE IS KSI
The person with the powder gum was making meth and he dipped it in the wrong powder and died
Me thinking it said candles thinking people will die from scents
Og longer eggs were fire
My mouth is actually getting watery seeing the toxic sweet
These guys dont understand that kinder eggs still exist in the UK
lmao heck yes harry come to Pakistan I'll take you to the factory
I swear this is a re upload
I’ve seen that gummy bear review on Reddit or somewhere years ago I think, anyone else?

5:52 The audio of the clip sounded like it was in my room, Harry looked around too
I tried the toxic waste candies when I was on a field trip and I loved them. They were sour as shit but I like sour candies. I kept asking my friend for more.
Stooped baby🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭

no joke i legit just watched this video this morning without even knowing sidemen reacted to it because it came up in my recommended, scary shit idk.
lets do it guys 300k
the penny would reach terminal velocity and would not kill the person
Canada has Popeyes not actual candy cigarettes
We know JJ enjoys the white powder these days
When tobi sees the spanish doing a Black Face : 😅 Everyone else : 😐😐😐
I really liked the toxic waste bars...
Lucas powder candy was the best. Whoever said this candy is too powerful. You is a pussy. And yes I’ve seen people sniffing the powder because I done it once and it wasn’t pretty lmfao😂
Australia still has kinder eggs they are amazing!!
15:32 I remember Ethan setting dog shit on fire
Did no one notice Tobi reaction when the priest were black faced during the carnival part?
you can still buy the candy cigarettes in sweden
Tobi's reaction when he saw the black guy on the cartwas same as mine when I saw the Pakistan Candy, but I haven't seen that candy anywhere.
Mexico isn't south american it's north american
11:20 i heard this story on 1000 ways to die
Not Harry saying "It was a stupid baby anyway" 😂😂😂
I remember toxic waste lol you’d buy a pack and eat 2 sweets then throw the rest out because it was actually painful lmao
12:42 i had the exact same reaction as tobi when that picture came up
🤣😂😂🤣harry chose violence
Toxic waste bars are on ebay
The candy cigarettes are still availbale in  Sweden😀
The editors did Harry dirty zooming on his face as he tried not to laugh about the little girl choking😂
I wondered what happened to Lucas 😬
WHAT IS At 10.45 =??????
New sidemen/moresidemen idea.....its the bingo challenge but instead of bingo you have to bust various urban myths
I create the worlds sourest gummies. I’m happy to send you guys some. If you can eat one with a straight face I’ll give you a life time supply 👍🏽
Hippy sippy is looking pretty good
12:43 Tobi notices the black face.
Wow stiped baby anyway hes not going to be a dad
How muck likes to eat a lead pipe

5:00. only Ogs know where hes getting that quote from

Wait Lucas was banned???? I swear they still exist I’ve had them multiple times
If you're reading the comments then like the video, we NEED to get to 300k so see harry and ethan eat those bars lmao
*Kinder eggs get banned*  Harry and Ethan: THATS RUBBISH
every video, I wish Ethan and Harry would goto therapy
The kid Simon said was vikk in a Reaction vid with tobi for having toxic waste, 2 litre bottle of cherryade and spraying lynx in his mouth, that's all I can see now
Why do Harry and ethan look to their left as soon as the narrator says Pakistan at 5:42....
Toxic waste are nothing.
If you think about it all candies kill you if you eat enough of it
here is the toxic waste chew bars https://www.zapsweets.co.uk/products/toxic-waste-sour-apple-chew-bars-50-count?variant=31348379680900&currency=GBP&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&utm_campaign=gs-2019-12-19&utm_source=google&utm_medium=smart_campaign&gclid=Cj0KCQiA0fr_BRDaARIsAABw4EsY6MwE9Nzn-P3ARrri61fvrD3eitIwD4cbxZTsKa2aJuuXM7fXmUIaAsjwEALw_wcB
Damn wr in canada got kinder chocolate eggs in every corner too much of them
The kinder egg being banned in the US isn’t true at all. If it were banned in the US they wouldn’t even sell em in this country and I see them at every store I go🤦
We still have kinder joy in india
Toxic waste isnt even sout they sell it nearby or used to at least
I agree with harry, I miss old kinder eggs... stupid babies had to ruin it 🙄
kinder eggs are not banned in Canada
Terminal velocity lads
If your mexican you've had lucas
Anyone else see kids at school snort smarties??
If you drop a penny from high up it reaches terminal velocity at a speed which is not great enough to kill a human.
Throwing coins at the bride & groom?! Have they never seen a UK lights carnival. The bastards launch coins over the top of the collection floats to hit people on the other side.
Ethan went to my old secondary school.
harry goes to court for cocaine  vik: your honor my client does not use drugs
I remember eating toxic waste, i remember my mom telling me to stop because my tounge had tiny patches of blood, i dont think its because it cuts but i don't remember
300k likes and we get to see Harry and Ethan eat lead
Sup
Someone Download this... Im damm sure this video is getting deleted... Just saying 😅
vik: i should be harrys lawyer  no u should let him talk, as for the rest.
the lucas candy is not banned in the U.S it’s still in stores 😂
I’ve had them chew bars o no
Just me or toxic waste ain't sour

Toxic Waste was a right of passage for any UK teen
@8:56 you ain’t lived if you ain’t sniffed sherbet sugar sweet at school 😂
that kid "lets have some gum ohh ive got a good idea lets dip in some 'malic acid' "  " oh shit that was thermite"
“i feel like I’ve done this in some festivals”😂😂
5:18 you can get at your local tesco
The gum one was an episode of 1000 ways to die.
Is it just me or is Ethans teeth way whiter than they normally are?
Ngl thought it said 10 candles banned , I was like wtf
No lie but I used to eat the Lucas candy and they’re good (never snorted tho)
Yessss finally tobi in a recent vid👌😂
all y'all comments suck, we've just watched the same video you have. don't quote everything, its annoying
Harry going to the factory to get some candy bars with lead in them.  They just give him some regular candy bars and a bullet.
No one: Literally no one: Thumbnail guy: 👁💥👁
14:12 Harry in an alternative universe😂
1 hour and 84k likes.... they definitely getting that toxic waste😂😂
Tobis reaction the blackface on the Spain one, other boys didn’t even clock it
Get back to school
Get the lead bar Bois
Number 9 is fake, I live in America and work at a grocery store and we have a ton of those eggs that sell quickly
The kinderegg is not banned in us
10:02 LA BEAST ❤️❤️🔥 his sugarfree gummy bear video is goated. You should react to it 😂😂😂😂
i snorted fun dip one time in 8th grade and that shit fucked me up 😭
Candy sticks are class
I used to love those toxic waste bars! I wondered where they went! 😂
Does smoking Smarties count?
Harry is by far my favourite
I live in mexico and that lucas candy is still here and ist actually really good.
Idk why it's funny that only Tobi noticed the blackface😂
I swear it said candles
Who knew that the orange thing  in the kinder egg is actually ment to be a yolk
I ate the  toxic waste chew bar a few years ago I'm not sure what to do but it has't had a negative affect on me yet, or at least not one that I have noticed
This is an underrated group!  They listen to Vik 😂😂😭😭
Get the bar!
what's arseface doing on the thumbnail
I swear we had chocolate cigarettes in the UK?
Pakistan I didn’t even know they had a toxic waste
I saw tobi think that they were doing black face
bro I had those toxic waste chew things and I had to get an apendix operation after
Harry should give a try to stand-up !
Toxic waste 🤣🤢 thats some sour shit but  I liked it
Can we all agree that harry is a goat for saying that the animal rights ppls reaction was over the top?
Tobi's reaction to the black face was the most priceless
if you drop a cherry pit from the top of the E state building it will shatter someones skull, so I think that a penny would go through someone
So why are cigarette gum not banned. You blow through the sweet and powder comes out 😂 😂Oh that is them. But you can get them in England. I've had them on my way to school before 😂 😂
My bois Simon and Tobi were ready for that photo :)
To be fair though...
4:15 Editor did him dirty.
The sidemen should react to Vik on Michael McIntyre's The Wheel
My store is filled with all these "banned" candies lmao especially the mexican ones.
kinder eggs still exist you fecks
I’ve seen so many students snort sherbet 😂
Bruh the toxic waste chew bar I had one like 2 weeks ago 😧😧😧
Did Harry just replace Vikk a the "Smart" one ?
I actually had those candy cigarettes before... Tasted pretty good tbh
12:42 Toby is realisation when he sees black face
Don't like the video pls, I don't want em to get lead poisoning :/
Here in Canada we still have Kinder Eggs. They are legendary.
candy ciggeretes in america for kids acctual cigeretes in uk
It get's really awkward when vik makes a jk that's nowhone laughs to.
When vikk quoted Bane from Dark Knight Rises 🥶🔥😱
I cannot ignore the fact that vik called cookie monster elmo....
"Just like dad" Ethan: Those cigarettes wont work for me
My headass misread and thought the title was "10 Canadians banned that can kill".
Harry’s lines recently have been MADDD!!! 🤣
300k 👍
12:41... Tobi wanted to say something about the use of blackface but decided not to change the tone of the video.
Who did that explosion gum edit on Harry. They need a pay raise 😂 😂
Sweet company- you can be just like dad  Ethan: “I guess that won’t work for me then” 🤣🤣🤣
Ethan’s hair
I say if they get more than 300k likes then they all have to do it🤷🏼‍♀️
we still have kindereggs with toys
I must be full of lead because I bought quite a few of them toxic sludge bars from an American candy shop the other day.
Like this video to help them eat my child hood favourite led chew bar 🤣
“10 *Candies Banned* That Can KILL”  Uh, I think your title has a mistake in it.
I believe they made kinder eggs and wonderballs  safe because they're sold here in the US at walmarts,etc
https://youtube.com/channel/UClUCXhB0kLlKgxgfRvFZgAw
No way not Lucas is so good wtf I didn’t even know this 😂
U can buy them toxic bars on eBay £3
who else snorted sherbet at school
popping candy use to kill people to back in the day
I will sacrifice my life for Pakistan!!!!!!!!
Tobi saw that blackface 😂 and kept quiet
There’s a whole video on the infographics show about dropping a penny off the Empire State Building. Basically it will only sting a bit as it will reach terminal velocity which wouldn’t be enough
When you are Mexican and see Lucas candies on the list 😳
Harry wtf lmao
SHOW MERCY FOR PERCY
When's the sidemen giveaway?
3:48 where else? Never heard of a kid choking on „Überraschungsei“.. probably parents forced their kids to eat it to file a lawsuit
Ah this confirms my dislike for Harry. Wish he'd go full time in other work
5:51 Harry got told off😂
You know, love hearts sweets should be banned. I crushed up a green one and sniffed it in German in year 9. I didn't enjoy it, I sneezed for 3 hours. I'm in Yr 12 now
12:57 "A 6 year old boy was killed when he went into a steet to collect some candy and was hit by the carridge" 13:00:Harry vibing
8:40 we see harry questioning why he didnt think of this idea first
How have they banned that lucas powder thing and not sherbet😂😂I’ve sniffed so much sherbert.
How did Harry get that penny drop right
There is a kinder egg version here in the US that's like similar but not the same. It's made in a safer way no just with a toy smack dab in chocolate, which tbh was a dumb idea, like asking for kids to choke
If you look at Tobi,s face around the 12:50 you can see him sigh because the image has blackface people giving out Candies
i am the kid that brought the toxic waste and laugh at someone whos mouth bleeds and then do the same thing t the end of the day cos i had some left aha
Number 1 Tide Pods
Lmao Toby was the only one that noticed the black face
Me: takes candy from the store Also me: "it will keel"
Maybe it's vik that does the drugs not Harry 😂 😂
the discomfort on tobi’s face after seeing the blackface :/ crazy how the others ain’t peep it
they still have these toxic waste bars in irish shops here-  legit in the shop down the road from me I had one also it's a much shorter ride than pakistan-
We still have the toys in kinder surprise eggs in Canada 🇨🇦 🇨🇦🇨🇦
Yummy ima just smoke my weed through this candy pipe, and then suck on the tar after... 10/10 Gordon would approve
I looked the bars up and there on eBay
I've seen a kid snort Lucas, his nose started bleeding.
I literally ate a toxic waste chew bar the other day
Gfuel has lead too
where I live they still have these bars even in the shop just down the toad from me ..... I had one recently- also yes ethan I was also that kid who's mouth bled but weirdly I never found them sour
I read the title as "10 Canadians banned that can kill"  Ummmm....
12:40 feel for you Tobi
scotland still has chocolate cigarets
They should have bought one of each
I heard about that citrus acid guy on 1000 ways to die and he was a student he made and dealt meth
70k likes in 1 hour  Get it to 300k
gdamnit harry i thought someone entered my room
Harry  for the first candy mmmmm for me?
Kinder eggs being banned in the US is so stupid because I've been in so many stores that have an American version of the product. Literally the same thing just not in an egg shape
Looks like a sex toy. Tobi showing he ain't as innocent as people think😎
Nearly 500k views but only 79k likes? You lot okay?
We still have candy cigarettes in germany
Ha funny lol I went to Germany recently and got the candy cigs
Its as if the sidemen know that candy from south america could only be on the list if it involved drugs
The bubble gum explosion was on 1000 ways to die
I'm on top in a couple days ago I was watching this
they still sell Lucas candy here in the us since I'm mexcan ik where they sell it like a whole LOT
Ayyyy in canada we still have kinder eggs
Am I the only one who still sees kinder eggs in shops 🤔
The sidemen need to read the sugar free haribo reviews on Amazon
Better idea, Harry just eats the probably harmless lead candy bar, if we get 300K likes he eats a real lead bar ;)
They still sell the fake cigarettes at my local gas station
I gave  this video a thumbs up straight after Harry’s line and the intro 😂😂
There’s a typo in the title u silly twats
Is that guys mouth in the thumbnail an actual asshole or what
that Lucas candy is still sold tho💀
Toxic waste is banned? Funny because I can walk into a shop and buy it lol
8:45 if you've never sniffed sherbet or anything you haven't had a childhood
Candy stick are fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Surely I wasn’t the only one who used to snort lines of sherbet as a kid 🤷🏽‍♀️
Anyone else notice they changed their title to be different than the original video by switching “banned” and “Candy” 😂
The keen mary quickly place because cost differently steer of a puzzled cattle. used, jittery arch
harry got so defensive of his kinder eggs hes not addicted to heroin hes addicted to his kinder eggs he is gonna have a kinder egg dealer.
Why didn’t Tobi say anything about the ‘black face’ in that Christmas parade he recognised it straight away.
Anything with death is a Try Not to Laugh for Harry
12:42 we see that black face lol
Me and my mates used to buy those candy sticks, don't know if it was the same in the UK but in NZ they were even called 'smokers' :P
12:43 I feel Tobi's pain on this one
Toxic waste is sour to you?
I like the king's when I go get thos fr tho
Thier editor is legendary 😂😂
I feel like everyone is overlooking the fact that there is an allowed level of lead in sweets... also if you dropped a penny off The Empire State building all you would do is drop it onto the ledge below along with all the other pennies that every other idiot that’s tried it is done
12:38 tobi laughing because of the men blackfacing
if your baby is going to choke on a toy its a stupid baby anyway hahahaha
We used to sniff all kind of stuff at school including dried glue, salt, pepper and ketamine. Good times.
LIKE, SOURCE THE BAR

That moment when Harry turns out to be the smartest sideman.  Who tf actually thinks a penny could slice through a human when dropped from that height. Your physics teachers are disappointed in you lot
Sidemen have to do a truth or dare where harry reveals the drugs he has done
We need that 300k
Haha we still have kinder surprise in Canada

Bro kids snort candy cans 😂
5:45 im from pakistan and i can say shit like this is very common around here so u do have to be careful. Its just corruption and the greed that causes this. Obv standards have gotten higher but not high enough
Vik- "never a normal video with the sidemen"  no Vik i think it's never a normal video with Harry lmao JJ is up there too lol
Bro it’s dumb how they say ppl smoked because of white candy sticks and say that’s the most dangerous that’s just bs how something that’s toxic is “less dangerous”

The UK had the chocolate versions with the brown tip to look like a cigarette and had the paper on it in the early 90s, not just candy sticks.

12:42 Tobi sighs because they're in blackface and nobody else even clocks it 😂
The roadkill candy concept kinda sounds cool but then again I see why it's not around anymore
Alternate title banned candies that can kill instead of candies banned that can kill
USA will ban kinder eggs for having toys in them.   Should have just replaced the toy with a tiny pistol and they would not care.

There was this kid at the back of my class in school who always used to crush up Parma Violets and snort it using paper.  he was a weird kid.  Also can we just take a minute to realise that Harry is dancing to the music lmao.
It’s the wife and groom who throw the 50ps out the car to the kids
Bro toxic waste is the sh**
Can you please react to "crazy things Indian billionaires bought" Video by "bright side" Channel Or culture (speciality) of India  Please
Tobi: ok we are not going to mention the blackface?!! 🤷‍♂️🧐  He was the only one to see it.
Man am starting to love "all" the sidemen
Harold is ruthless
Glad Covid-19 cancelled Halloween cause after seeing this video it’s put me off sweets *proceeds to eat bon bons from the corner shop*
Everyone go to Amazon the toxic waste bars are there
I think I can but the toxic waste bar things in Sweden still. Has something gone wrong?  Also what's so weird with kids snorting powder candy haven't we all snorted something at some point?¨(I don't mean drugs I've personally snorted plain sugar, Not nice)
All there is is normal shaped gummies and gummy worms. These idiots can't come up with something better than roadkill. It's a good idea.
well pakisthan is near to india jusr saying
Tbh I sniffed nerds
Don’t let your children eat the toys. Meanwhile Harry jumping off roofs
WAIT!!! THEY TOOK TOYS OUT OF KINDER EGGS!!!!!! HOW DIDN'T I KNOW ABOUT THIS!!!!

tobi knows 12:40
9:04 Ethan’s laugh just said “no more!”
I like this vid cos they seemed less bothered about what they said how it should be 👍🏻
I remover everyone would snort that candy back in the day people still do with the newer version
You can see tobi trying not to say anything when he sees the blackface
Yesss the Karl Pilkington bit hehehe
Fun fact, toxic waste is round the corner at bossman’s shop
HAHAHAHA I read it as candles! Lolol candies makes more sense.
Just for context, due to g the speed of and object would increase by 9.8m/s every second, so, from the height for the empire state buildings it's some serious speed that would definitely crack your skull, however, the penny's mass is very low
No one in the world can disagree with Harry, every kid above the age of 3 would know that you can't eat a fucking plastic toy, and if a parents doesn't teach his/her kid not to eat small things by the time the kid is 3 years old, the kid is just plain stupid, kinder eggs are one of the most delicious candy there is but stupid parents never teach their kids not to eat them or just buy them for their 1 year olds
U can still get them toxic waste bars in the local corner shops in boro
Right when I saw the title i was thinking ahhh the damn kinder eggs
13:40 I'm with Harry
Sidemen reacts 2-3 days, more sidemen 2-3 days, and sidemen 1 day. Sidemen everyday, I love it!

All candies kill lads sugar init

Petition to unban Pakistan International Airlines from Europe so Harry can fly to Pakistan.    (If you don’t know PIA had multiple incidents and one that killed everyone on board but 2 people and it was discovered that many of the pilots in their fleet did not have real pilots licenses. They resolved the issue but were still banned from flying anywhere in Europe. Don’t know about the America’s or Oceania, probably not allowed .)
Toxic waste was so famous in pakistan every kid ate it in large amounts
I didn't start the video and I can tell that kinder egg something toy will definitely be there

in my class people snort sherbet when we wait for the teacher to arrive to the classroom 😭

Who else saw Tobi's reaction to the blackface?
The explosive powder was actually red phosphorus which if put under pressure causes an explosion
Thank god ethan is not in The thumbnail
toxic waste isnt even that sour
At least kinder eggs still in the uk
Its not banned in Latvia
Claim your "here before they switch the words candies and banned" ticket here
No one: Not even SidemenReacts: Bots:Be honest who else is a TRUE fan of SidemenReacts for over a month now
Beware the whole comment section is about Harry's one quote
I am from pakistan and i had never seen this toxic waste candy...
In the UK u can find toxic waist bars in shops - ive had a few and there not that sour :]
"if your baby is going to choke on a toy it was a stupid baby anyway."
When ur so early the words in the title are the wrong way round
Wow. Harry out here calling people’s babies stupid
Fun fact: Lucozade is banned in Canada because of something that’s in them; if being imported, it’ll be seized by customs officers
kinder eggs still around guys.. i had one yesterday lol
I’ve had a toxic waste bar at Sweden in 2019, I fount it in a grocery store
I just really wanna see if they can get their hands on on of those led toxic waste bars
Lead in a chew bar ???!!😯😲😳😳😳
3:54 do they not have barmbrack with the ring
Am i the only one who noticed that tobi was the only one to notice the black face
Lucas candy SMACKKSS Doe 😂🔥
I still snort lines of fruit pastel dust
God I hope Ethan and Bog find the toxic waste.
12:43 As a spanish guy, this hurts. Not gonna lie, it was very, very common to have Baltasar being a white male painted black. When I was a child/teenager I saw it ridiculous, yeah, but not racist. It is racist. Good news are that nowadays at least where I live baltasar is a black guy, so progress has been made.
3 year old dies  Harry: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol when Tobi peeps the blackface 😬😅
12:00 why did I find that hilarious,😂😂
I had candy cigs, like last month 🤨
I'm from south America guyana
Narrator: hippy sippy  😂😂😂
4:15😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
First you guys need to do a banned candy taste video, the exploding gum thing was a person making drugs and would chew gum for hours in his basement so he would dip it in the nitric acid for the sour taste but u know the rest
Tobi just know that we saw it to
Vik saying “omg it’s so good” made my day
Toxic waste Tobi: have you seen it? Ethan: do not cite the deep magic to me witch, i was there when it was written
13:06 Vikk that’s only our culture G
poor eugene in the thumbnail
Harry's dealers gonna start restocking these candies
13:00 A boy dead **Harry just vibin**
sure i snort lines with sherbert hhahaha
*_LMAOOO_*
I was the kid snorting lucas
9:04 oh Ethan that was the worst fake laugh ever
A wise man once said  " If a baby is going to choke on a toy its a stupid baby anyways" - Harry
**LOL**
I don’t want to be a kill joy but this thumbnail is so shameful that man has gone through so much bullying from the media and to be used as if his mouth has a sour sweet in it is disrespectful, I expected better lads
JESUS loves you porn is a sin
imagine going up to a drug dealer like “oi, do you have any hippie sippy👀”
7:38 editor finally putting Vik's greenscreen to good use
Can anyone say me the name of the music they use in the last outro of merch??
They should try to get all of these candies and try them in a video.
Look at Harry's face when it said factory was located in Pakistan😂😂😂😂
Am surprise White rabbit didn't make the list. White Rabbit candy was recall back in 2008  because of concerns over possible melamine contamination and it was a world wide scandal
That gum with citric acid story was from 1000 ways to die
Me always buying cigarette candy and smoked smarties Also me never had the urge to actually smoke the real thing
8.50 similar but with dibdab at school hahaha
I love how they put tobi's face on a sweet video
Why is no one talking about the fact that Ethan was actually good in this video?
Is that Eugene on the thumb nail
toxic waste chewbars are 50p lol
Id eat them either way
yo kids in my school used to crush up smarties and sniff them
Like the video for jokes
a penny cant harm you because it cant reach a high enough speed, this is called terminal velocity. i was so happy when harry got it correct, felt like a proud father lmao
I’m so sorry Tobi 😂😭

People do not usually throw coins at most weddings but it is common at an Indian wedding.
How did the replies to these comments become such a mess??
Harry: "can we get 300k likes, THATS IT!"  Me: Only has 151 subs
Vik,Tobi and Ethan: "oh no thats horrible" Harry: Just dancing to the background music.
At 2:17 , Harry's face says it all 😂
The toxic waste candy fits the name since it had literal fucking acid lmao.
I love them talking about throwing penny’s at a car , where I live in the carnival parades a car drives round with a target and you have to lob penny at it hitting the target on the net but if you miss u dash a 4 yr old in the head with a penny
Tobi was the only one who noticed the blackface 🥺😫 12:40
Best part is the kinder eggs are still allowed in Canada.
300k likes lads 📈📈📈
I swear Harry will get this channel exterminated 😂😂
Is it only me who could eat an entire toxic waste tub thing in one go and it wasn't even sour
I love the Candy cigarettes lol...my aunt still get them and I take some. THEY ARE SO GOOD!!

It’s funny how only Tobi clocked the blackface at 12:40. His expression 😂
But a penny can harm uu.. Like when a tornado catches small objects and they cut through 🚘
On todays sidemens reacts   Harry.  calls babys stupids  Ethan. Takes a embarassing photo  Tobi. Regret being friends like these   Vik. Is just 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
9:13 Vikk and Tobi touch the corner of their eyes at the same time!
Like and get 1 of the candies
8:42 lets be honest we have all snorted sherbet sometime in our life right? in america its called pixie sticks or sum
I remember the guy who dipped his gum into explosives, he was in 1000 ways to die. Now all i can remember is the narrator making a pun about it.
>Blackface 12:42 Tobi's face lul
Yo I just noticed that Vik and Tobi touched their eyes at the same time at 9:14
https://youtu.be/AeLuDNsgNZM

"It was a stupid baby"  -2021 Harry aka, W2S.
You guys should react to music
I can literally can say Sidemen these days are reacting to videos that I hv watched before in quarantine.
It’s the start of 2021 and Harry already had the best quote of the year
Harry said he hates needles. Reddit do your thing
Tobis reaction to black face was prime
istg the sidemen the only people that can consistently bring fun content  i love this new reaction channel
Did anyone else read the title as "10 candles" I thought I was trippin
Harry would mistake the citric acid for a different kind of white powder
Hi
3:07 natural selection
Its funny that im from Pakistan but ive never ate or seen a toxic waste candy bar or candy ever here
I got chills for the next 30 minutes after seeing his mouth in the thumbnail
Guys. If this video gets 300k likes, next sidemen Sunday will only be 5 people 😂
As a guy who was a little mexican kid once in its life, yeah I confirm that kids will sniff the candy.. also I didnt know it had too much lead, for us was just Chili and salt

Those candy cigarettes are in every country on balkan and more, why tf are they lying??

Anyone else felt weird while saying the title?
Raa those toxic wastes we’re mad I used to put so much in mouth and thought I was badd😭

Love who they have Arseface from Preacher in the thumbnail.
Hello
Toxic waste for banned from my school
FaZe Rug used the Toxic Waste in one of his recent videos. DM him and ask him how to get one!
Those toxic waste things are in Kmart in Australia
Kinder eggs are still a thing so are toxic waste well in the UK anyway
This isn't sidemen reacts, this is tales from the rough parts of town with Ethan
I still eat Lucas candy to this day
‘If the baby is going to choke on a toy it’s a stupid baby’   Quote of 2021 January
Suck through the needle, I have done this” Yeah. We know Haroldinho

Kinder eggs are really good but the yolk is always hard to swallow.

Tobi I had the same reaction bro ifykyk 🤦🏾‍♂️
90% stupid baby  10% bots
I love Tobi's reaction to the blackface at 12:40 , the others are just clueless as to what theyre watching though xD
JJ EXpoSed
They still have the toxic waste chew bars in shop near me ? Edit: I think this list is made for Americans
Had to dislike on this one boys.
If a penny drops from high altitude it can't gain enough momentum to do any real harm. But if you throw a penny or load it in to a shotgun shell for example. It can most certainly do harm and will reach alot higher velocity. As it has a force propelling it forward and it's not just freefalling.
Amazon sell them
Am I the only person that doesn't find Toxic Waste extremely sour, I like sour sweets maybe that's why.
Harry: What are we watching today ethan Ethan :"10 banned candies that can kill" Everyone else watching the video: no we are watching ethan go OHHHHHH ans interrupting the video
Go on amazon sour sweet hamper and you will find it
Harry is built different
I love how Harry holds his bottle🤣
Well i have had too much lead apparently from that toxic waste bar
Next video idea: "Try to not to laugh at dead babies."
They haven’t banned kinder eggs here in Sweden 😌😌
i swear harry has a problem with being unintentionally funny
mans face on the thumbnail looks like a butthole
All of these are what Vik gives out on Halloween to kids
I got a good intro hey Sidemen Stan or the SS welcome back to another SidemenReacts video
300k likes for Harry and Ethan to try the banned Toxic Waste Sludge Bar, let's get it lads
Harry looks good in beard    Change my mind 😌
Toxic waste is some shit sweet not even sour
They still sell the candy cigarettes in Denmark. I hope they never get rid of them, because they were so fun as a kid. I don't smoke either so, it doesn't affect everyone.
Fun fact: if u drop a penny from a high building and when it goes down to the floor it can actually cut someone because of how fast its falling
Be honest, when the toxic waste came up your mouth started watering because you felt the sour taste
Candy dynamics is not a Pakistan based company. It's Indiana US based company
12:43   yes tobi i see it too, anyone else?
The exploding part of the gum that dude was actually making meth on 1000 Ways to Die he was a science major and he dipped it in the wrong chemical and boom it exploded and killed him I remember this he was making meth like high-quality meth trying to be like the Eisenberg I do deserve to die not going to lie

Yo who wrote title of this video, lame
Tobi and I saw something that made all black people uncomfortable 😐
I fucking LOVED the buble gum cigarettes with the sugar powder in them. I was searching for them everywhere but just now I realized they are banned. That SUCKS, they were so good tasting 2.                        PS. I don't smoke

11:17 - 11:43 For those who've watched 1000 Ways to Die, you should understand this! Hell, even remember this!
I agree with Ethan that picture is amazing. It’s very them like Ethan said. And it’s so endearing.

What’s your favourite sweet: Tobi: Haribos  Vik: Nerds  Ethan: toxic wastes  … Harry: LUCAS MUECAS 😏😏😏
How was Toby the only one who noticed this 12:43? Like fully how did the others not notice
"JJ the minstrels muncher" - tobi
Harry:”suck through the needles?!” Also Harry:”I’ve done this”
the exploding chewing gum thing happened the exact same to an american meth cook,  he was dipping his gum in citric acid powder to flavour it and then he accidentally dipped it in the phosphorus he was using to make the meth becasue he hadnt slept in about 3 days so he was tired and thats why he kept flavouring his gum, becasue it had lost its flavour. its in an episode of 1000 ways to die on amazon. i found it on youtube but its age restricted tho:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uei916nsCK4
Am fuming 😤 i mess them old kinder eggs good old days
Poor Tobi, no one realized the blackfaces
Here in South Africa we still have candy cigarettes
8:42 me as a Mexican born in America I can approve that we did this a lot we were low-key retarted back in elementary and what's funny I sold it to everyone I was the supplier cause when I would go to Mexico I would bring 10 bags each containing like 50 of them and yes everyone got so addicted that they banned candies in my school
I'm loving the harry quote 😂😂

In primary school me and a friend (paul) would lay out 2, 3inch lines of pepper and everyone would bet money on who could snort it the fastest
The lukas one is straight bs lmao the only people complaining about kids sniffing the candy were over exaggerated parents it was not that common
1st candy introduced. Heroin...I meant hippy dippy.
you can still buy chew bars in the uk
I snorted smartey
Toby and I realized the Black Face from the Spanish Christmas parades at the same time...

12:40 Tobi trying so hard not to mention the obvious blackface 😂
300k Likes for Toxic Sluge bars make that shit happen
I am the 833rd comment
Cabalgata de reyes still happens every year i dunno whst they talking about
In my middle school (6th grade and 7th grade/ year 7 to year 8 in my town) the kids would snort Smarties, which lead to Smarties being banned in our school. (I live in the United States just for reference of what type of Smarties were being snorted.) US Smarties are like the UK Fizzers.

I remember the first time I had Toxic Waste candy. It was the most sour thing I had ever tasted. I had more cos I really like sour candy.
Wtf harry

https://youtu.be/N6_T-WC7LtI
Bro that candy is like For fuck sake don’t try it
PLEASE just 1 video without Ethan.
7:38 thats an excellent use of greenscreen
I bought a toxic waste bar the other day they're not banned, although I do live in eastern europe 😂
toxic waste can't be made in pakistan cause i live here and we don't get them here so how can it be made in pakistan
i ate toxic waste in school and 6 people follow me to the toilet and we all got kicked out of the toilet bruh wow
12:43 tobi didn't want to talk about the blackface
I always eat toxic waste its warhead but a bit more sour
How come Ethan is in Every sidemenReacts video
i love chocolate cigarettes back in the days

I'm worried about harry as father
When I went to Germany, they were still selling sweet cigarettes
Who edits these videos?
harry is gonna be an amazing father, no doubt lmao
HELLOOOOOO
I’m not used to saying to reading the word candies cause I’m British  So I read it as canadies and got so confused 🤣🤣
12:00 The editor who did this is going to hell 😭
I'm very confused because, I literally went down to the shop today and literally bought a kinder egg, someone explain of this is only is some countries
There is a shop in crediton with loads of chew bars
Y’all should just react to Amazon reviews of the sugar free gummy bears. The reviews are so funny😂
Kid chocked and dies: Harry: Tries not to laugh at it

Harry acting like they dont exist anymore! im 20 if i want a kinder product I just buy it, eat it and give it to my 7 year old nephew ! easy! done! they aint in US maybe but are defo in Ireland and UK
Tobi's reaction to the blackface was priceless 🤣

We still got kinder eggs in Australia
Rip Harry’s jaw
Any other Americans confused about how they don’t have kinder eggs in the UK
If Harry ever has a baby I’m going to be scared for him, he will let it choke to death😂😂
12:40Tobi is the only one who notices the mad black face going on 😂
Why when Toby wants to do something with the others, does he always say "If you man do it first then I'll do it". And his voices changes😂
12:40 Tobi realising that the Madrid guys were in blackface was gold 😂
I heard that gum story from watching 1000 ways to die

Agree with Harry
11:57 it was on a show called "1000 ways to die" idk if it was a thing in the UK but it was a popular show in America.
66,666 views for me
Bog should do a South Asian trip after Covid has been done with. Pakistan, India and then Bangladesh. It will be Epic.
7:43 if i eat a easter egg it doesn`t mean i want to lay an egg does it.
12.43 reaction of Toby is  priceless to depiction of black people in general

12:00 THAT EDIT IS GOATED
Harry is goated Idc 😭😭😭😭😭
My favourite memory of sweets was when one of my friends snorted half a pack of Fizzers (uk sweet) in my science class. It was jokes and it still shocks me that the teacher did not notice.
Hello
Someone should tell tobi that tooth fillings have mercury in them then that would blow his mind
Tobis job is to smile in the top left
12:42 Tobi was the only one that noticed it
Baby: fucking dying  Harry: dumb twat
Ay lads this channel got bare grim bare quick

It's now an Ethan and friends React.

Sweets are better than chocolates 💯
12:42 😳😬😭
Have a friend who once snorted popcorn flavoring in a AMC, he a interesting guy.
Toby wanted to be a part of the bar eating thing but Ethan and harry just excluded him😂
We all thank KSI for taking Harry with him in the sidemen because yep I know you guys know he had bad people beside him
12:45 tobi was the only one to notice the black face😂😂😂
first thing i heard when i clicked on this video: -''bullshit''

If Ya Was Gonna Choke On A Toy It Was A Stupid Baby Anyway ~ Harry 2021
"A girl in France choked and died on a kinder egg toy" Harry: *funniest sh*t I've ever seen*
Harry is to funny
I hear the word ‘toxic waste’ my mouth starts watering ready for that mad sourness
Vote for ksi❤️
9:13. Look at Tobi and vik
I'm too early to see someone blessing my mother
Lmao I’m watching this while eating a candy
The toxic bar company is closed in Pakistan thankfully
The only thing toxic waste did to me was take all my skin off in my mouth
I can’t keep up with Harry 😂😭😭
Harry being Harry:- "If your baby is gonna choke on a toy it was a stupid baby anyways"
early
I’ve eaten toxic waste. It’s not as sour as people make it seem
Vik: ''Everyone looked awful in that picture'' Tobi: Actually tried his best
The fact that I’ve tried most of these candies makes me shit myself
Nobody Gonna Talk About This 7:03 Or Just Me lol
Last time I was this earlu everyone was calling Sebastian balls an orange
WTF we still have kinder surprises in Canada
It stupid how people that eat animals are against the "roadkill gummy bears" and hold up posters with pictures of animals begging not to be killed,  cant these idiots realise that they eat are doing worse things,  the gummy bear designs dont harm the animals, what actually harms them is when you kill the animals just to eat them
They post daily on this channel
Wait,wait,wait what is led???
Fun fact: Harry and I are bother addicted to hard drugs and both afraid of needles  Harry: "I rate that"
The sludge bars u can still buy in Ireland
These are just normal candy did you know?
*a kid chokes on a toy and dies* Harry to his father in the funeral: you are better off without him, If your baby’s gonna choke on a toy then it’s a stupid baby anyway
Literally every candy I think Harry has tried to do at one point
Toxic waste isn't sour
Tobi’s face when he saw that there was alcahool in haribo😂😂😂
People who were here before 30 mins like this
Title is wrong it’s 10 banned candies that can kill not 10  candies banned that can kill
Is that the person who voices simple history or am I just bugging?
Y’all should react to sooyoung she was the lady eating the toxic waste. She eats a lot of crazy things
Nah mate you only sniff sherbert. Its so good mate.
hi
This Ethan guy is good  He should make a yt channel or something
‘it was a stupid baby anyway’ that’ll be in Harry hall of fame
Hi
The names of some of  these sweets makes me not suprised that they were banned in the first place
why are people so surprised that kids are snorting candy? if you haven’t snorted pixie sticks in middle school that’s on you
I love those lucas candies
Most ppl watching this has most probs ate at least 1 of these
Helllo
4:14 the editor did Harry dirty
Whos coming to Pakistan with me

Harry has definitely tried hippy sippy at a festival
Anyone else's school banned sherbet straws?
I bet Harry's child will be a drug lord
