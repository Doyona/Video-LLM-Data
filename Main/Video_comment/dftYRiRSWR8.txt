Rip to my v-bucks! Thought this will last longer than a month
We got a baaaanger for you baby
9:12 amazing clip also i love that we also get a evolution of timmy tenders too <3 i wanna thank you tim for always providing content for us, especially in these difficult times (on my end) thank you for the distractions and positive vibes you always bring and as always, tell somebody you love em, have a great one <3
I miss of Fortnite 🙁☹️🥺😢😭
Most garbage season for us battle royal players. It sucked so hard I quit more games because of lack of weapons and shields and walking around trying to find anyone for like 10min. Stupid, I thought falling out of trees and dieing once every 5 games was bad but damn
It felt good to go back to OG Fortnite so many memories so much nostalgia. It was an overflow and I will always miss it and I will hope that Fortnite does another OG Fortnite season.
A lot of memories from playing and watching you guys stream. Love you timmy, thanks for the memories
Og needs to come back. I love the new maps and stuff too but the og was just soooooo incredible in a way the newer modes and maps haven’t been
I will miss Fortnite og 4ever😢
Miss the old stream room tbh
Can anyone explain what's happening?
Cheeseburger
Trying to see if I get an icon next to my name
Grown men btw
Just as they announce it’s coming back 🙌🙌
Ngl Fortnite og had a lot of sweats and ruin the game but goodbye og Fortnite
Farewell to OG Fortnite, it was a true pleasure
Tim with hair literally has me cryinggggg
Great compilation, I like how its more wholesome moments instead of good plays etc it really captures the vibes shared with the boys
Google is in the works to bring furnite back on both ios and Android permanently
Time to get back to cod now 😅
Do you even stream ?
The clip with courage and the mech is amazing the fact he never got to cast after either makes it funnier
Only real ones know Tim from overwatch
I dont like fortnite OG shit
tim i love that you’re a tool fan
o7 farewell my old friend.
I hope they add this later as a permanent game mode
Can we also have a fail compilation which will most likely be 98% fall damage
KEEP OG FORTNITE. Soak it in. Every do not dance sign, every shopping cart, dancing in front of the bass. My god it was a month to remember
Brb all up in my feelings this map is leaving me with now. It feels so sad saying goodbye a second time
Chill out Ricky Bobby
OG fortnite I will miss u forever
6 Years it's been for this game we've been playing.  And now, We're really sadly on the verge of saying goodbye to OG Fortnite...
The crazy thing is so many people started watching Tim during his War Zone days and make fun of him for going back to Fortnite.. but they didn't realize these are the memories all of us OGs have of Tim and the bois 😅
Sucks he never plays solos anymore or with different people
They gotta keep it in the game. Or else lose all ur og players again
Did Tim sell his outro to Good Good?
It’s crazy that his first Fortnite win and his first warzone win are basically the same clip just in a different game
Beta is out for mini Royale again you should definitely hop back on it I loved the last 2 videos you posted can’t wait for more
We should all boycott and not many until they make it permanent. Give the people what they want!
I love OG Fortnite and you and your content Timmy keeping me entertained everyday thanks for the laughs man!!💜🔥
Old girthquake slapped
PLease Epic!  I know you are watching.  PLease keep OG Fortnite as a playable mode.  Look at the player count!!!!!!!
o7
Tool sucks take that off
If I don't get into the event I'm going to lose my mind, but I'm definitely watching Tim's reaction to it.
I am excited to see what’s coming next season
I remember watching Timmy react to his first win, good nostalgia.
That is my favorite shirt tim, I have 2 tool shirts and a Hoodie lol I've seen them twice and both were incredible.
I wish you’d go back to R6 😢
Crazy if you think its going away forever. Look at what it did to the games popularity.
We gonna miss you og Fortnite, good too see you once again
this was why they gave us the ability to make our own games and maps with unreal ima need the big brains to get unreal cracking why dont us as players make og fortnite
Mami Tim with the Glow up, shine on forehead
That 36 hour black hole was the worst bro everyone had no idea what to do nor how long it would be gone😂
It’s weird that both your first Fortnite win and Warzone win ever happened with a bolt action sniper hitting a clean ass headshot on a guy next to a tree
That accidental rocket ride elimination was insane.
Poetic that Tim’s first Fortnite win and first Warzone win both ended with a sniper kill!
I looked away for one minute and was confused as hell when I saw two tims
I’m gonna miss this map. But hyped for new season
I'm gonna miss OG Fortnite
Clickbait ahh thumbnail still got 18 hours left
5:10 one of the best clips of Tim’s Fortnite career honestly 😂😂😂
Idk why epic games can’t just make OG Fortnite a separate game mode like no build
just came to tell tim that that seahawks dallas game last night was the worst officiated game i have ever seen and i watched the 2005 superbowl...
Lazy eye was goin crazy in the intro
Dude talks 20 mins for a intro
USE ME AS A PETITION ARE WHERE VOTES ARE LIKES TO GET TIMMY FATSO TO GROW HIS BEARD OUT TO MAXXXXIMUM CAPACITY UNTIL GTA 6 IS RELEASED
What a game, I miss the old game and when it was better and many things were better back then.
The prank at 10:00 😂😂😂👌
Big fan tim pls keep being u
Ngl Tim's videos be funny af 😂
Where we dropping tonight Tim?
Love the shirt
How hasn’t someone done a challenge: Get a win without getting out of a vehicle. Low key that can be a hard one to do.
Tims long beard was....not good lol
rip 🪦
Farewell to all the OG players and welcome to all the new players that this month brought to the game
Reaver LETS GO CHAMP
Only timmy could accidentally rocket ride an enemy rpg point blank and die to fall damage
Yo i had not played fortnite in what 4 years? i came back for this O.G. and i haven't played another game since!!! i SINCERELY, SINCERELY, HOPE- it stays!!! PLEASE EPIC- Keep it the way it is in O.G.!!! PLEASE...
You had hair
"I die"
Wait... Timmy's first fortnight win and Warzone win ends with Timmy clutching with a sniper!!
such a bad idea just leave it in the game
Thank god you got rid of that man bun
Bro he used to be cracked at fortnite 😅
24h stream confirmed?ples
sending you love and respect tim great to watch over the years sorry about all the troll messages from when i was a little kid much love
That golf cart rift edit went so hard
Bring back the beard!
jack is a literal voice actor
was good
Goodbye Fortnite* because everyone is going to quit after this weekend again except for kiddies.
I’m so disappointed it didn’t have Jack reviving you and flint knocking you into the trap several times!
Yoo the Tool shirt is awesome
so, you're reacting to a reaction of a reaction?
Part time streamer, full time content maker 🙄😂
It’s crazy hearing the clip about how if he has a kid he can’t wait for him to find out what he does.
I'm gonna miss getting into a meat sweat head to head match with a player,  only to have someone who's been sitting sideline the whole time shoot me once at 12% health as soon as i eliminate my opponent.  Hope they keep that in Season 5!
I'm curious how many live players they lose as soon as it switches  back. Cuz I know I'm out.
8:00 when they made the change for walls to match elevatation was actually one of the best changes of OG fornite
I'm not emotional you are
I’m definitely doing a cease fire
Remember when tim used to be full-time? Good ol days.
12:26 that is all
Ohhh the mr. part time... good to see you i guess..
Thank god
Warzone 3.0 season 1 Dec 6th lads
I honestly can't see them getting rid of it for long as the player increase they've had is unreal they will loose alot of those people
I will never understand the way streamers go the ALI-A route and feel the need to say what is happening out loud like we cannot see it.
Damn without a hat that’s strange
@baddbrii 14:50
that black whole hits so different man
it's goodbye for now but we will meet again
The way the music fades away 2:35 😂
Back to some good R6
👍👍👍👍
4:41 this moment is beyond majestic 😂
When we watch these old videos im forever reminded how bad you looked with that massive beard.
Courage was over the top too much during the comet thing. LIke yikes.
you have convinced me to like the video and subscribe, well done tim
as a literal OG myself im lost on why i fight avxry and not you
What a boring month it’s been with OG Fortnite. I just think it’s very lackluster and don’t care for it. I’m so ready for the next chapter.
Back to good games now, hopefully.
Fortnite events are the peak of gaming.
Has to be a permanent game mode man
If it wasn't for Fortnite I might not have stumble on your channel, for that I will always have a place for OG Fortnite. Also how crazy is it that Tims first win in Fortnite and Warzone are Snipes
got me in my feelings tim....
The "Tim!" sub sound or whatever it's tied to activates my nostalgia like crazy.
Kinda ironic that back in the day, we were ready for the OG map to be gone. What a turn around it has been lately!
lol tim with hair
I had some fun in this og season but it doesn’t compare to the original, and honestly had more fun watching you guys reminisce and have fun together again.
Sad saying goodbye for the 2nd time
I wasn't initially impressed, but after playing it more, I agree with you. OG is better.
OG Fortnite i will miss you forever
People acting like somebody die is crazyyyyyyy
5:08 has to be the best clip ever! Not just because its Tim and fall damage, but never seen that happen to anybody else 😂 and his reaction 😭
Why ,  rave cave Fortnite map is waaaaaaaaay better.  I can’t wait till they get rid of it.
Courage talks so much with his fake reactions that he almost ruined the damn black hole event
Good! Glad its gone. No more Ninja! bout time
Courage would be the most annoying person to do a live event with… He literally never shuts up so you can just enjoy the moment🤡
Got teary eyed watching this video RIP OG fort
Bring back the Oddish hair!
Hopefully somebody makes a map if no game modes comes out with 100 players
Just saw TOOL in concert recently… absolutely unforgettable.
Good vid Timmy
OG fortnite broke RECORDS
When did the beard get so long
"I DIED" 😧
Tim dying laughing always makes me laugh😂 his laugh is contagious fr
Well looks like I’m uninstalling again lol
What an amazing month this has been with og fortnite! Would have loved to see it remain in some way or another, vibes just on another level period!
Who else is hit with the nostalgia from this
I totally forgot about Tims top man bun😂😂😂
Tim used to be so good at this game lol he still fell to his death all the time but he has some good clips. What happened
If they dont keep it on. Maybe do it every year. Or every few months between bigger seasons.
Im not crying, you’re crying!
Part timer
Finally this seasons over I hated this "OG" Season glad it's ending
hearing you talk about what it would be like to have a kid and if your still streaming, then seeing you now with your kid and your channels growing bigger than ever put a smile on my face
I definitely will miss OG Fortnite, and I will always remember the old days of me watching Fortnite YouTubers
BYE BUE FORTNITE OG! Too many sweats
I am done if they dont keep OG Fortnite. Chapter 4 was awful in comparison. Unless Chapter 5 is really good im leaving Fortnite forever, I would consider it a dead game
If OG Fort ends up gone, so will I. Only reason I came back to the game.
Goes to show how much he overreacts lmao. When he’s showing his first win, he’s not screaming every 2 seconds or sounding like a complete imbecile just to have the audience correct or laugh at him. Boring ass streamer enjoy the “spectating” gameplay he does XD top tier content
Great memories 😢 The OG fornite wouldn't have been the same without you, Tim!
I hope it’s not gone, it’s the only reason why I’m back to playing 😅
Isn't it crazy that tim's first fortnite win and his first warzone win are almost identical endings?
Player count and revenue will go down massively. Theyll bring it back.
3:40-4:10 needs to be in the Gaming Hall of Fame
What a NICE clip from 4:35 to 4:50...  GG Tim. 2023
Og was fun but can't wait for it to  be over. It's just not fn to me anymore.
yeah if they take away og mode, im legit done playing again lol
😂Just a friendly reminder don't trust courage
I love you Tim. Thanks for making us smile and laugh everyday man, it’s much needed
Really enjoyed you playing this again mate ❤
Watching tim in og fortnite lol is cringe
Eletric timmy keep up the hard work.
RIP OG.. Thank you for the memories 😅
They should release og fortnite for a month every year. Or like tim said, just have it as a game mode....
9:13 little does he know he would have a child and thriving man it came full circle 🔥
FINALLY
Dear Jesus,   Please grant epic the wisdom to leave in a game mode with the loot pool and mechanics of week 1 or 2 of of og fortnite. The map can be whatever they like.   Amen
Bro back to trash bruh 😭😭😭
Good riddance, piece of junk boring ass season.
Runninbout of ideas huh
It couldn't be gone sooner fuck I hate this map
I miss Tim with a beard
my heart is burning
It was great reliving old memories 👌👑
Goodbye greasy grove..😟😟
COWBOYS SHOULD NOT OF WON THE REFS WERE SO BAD HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY THEM TIM? CMON!!!!!!!
Time to get back on the r6 grind Timmy it sucks they’re taking it away
Please please it would be so EPIC if you kept OG Fortnite
Why would fortnite get rid of OG mode when they're getting the most players they've had in years? They don't want us to have fun
Love you Tim
Goodbye for now ❤
The genuine fun and laughter is something that is just absent today…
good. nostalgia is too strong of a drug. let it go.
Good days 😢😢😢 now the game is going to be trash
Good times gone to fast
Tell Nickmercs to cut loose the two apex guys, I feel bad for them carrying someone's skill equivalent to your dead weight
Really do hope they add it as its own gamemode
Anyone else notice lately on other videos Tim's editor zooms in every 2 seconds unnecessarily
The screaming for the kids is so tiresome
I’m a terrible Fortnite player lol but this og season has been the most fun I’ve had 👍
finally a Tim balding timelapse video!
Watching this rewind you can see Timmy morphing from a fat man with a beard, to just a Fat man…aka reverse boosting
I don’t see how they’d take it away forever given the fact that their highest player count ever was due to OG Fortnite
I'll miss OG fortnite for sure. so many good memories.
imma miss it
Even though we only got this for one month I had so much fun with the og map being back we will all miss you and good bye og map and og Fortnite
One of the first hundo to be here baby! Lmao love you tim!!
Peter griffin 2 days fixes it all
Lmaoo it was never even og fortnite it was season 3 and above fortnite clowns
Make og permanent
I’ve never seen Tim with hair before, he was kinda rockin it ngl
Used to skip school just for some fortnite events and now I graduated early this year can't forget fortnite 😢
Tim with the big beard is so crazy to look back on, it's like a completely different person!
There's no reason the devs CANT keep the OG fortnite. They probably just did this for the money let's be honest. OG fortnite is way better than today's fortnite. They could easily keep the OG fortnite as a separate game mode permanently.
This is weird, video games were meant to be eternal.
Yo
Good, Im done with this map. Sorry, Chapter 2 remains my nr1.
8:34😂😂😂😂
i got goosebump with the black hole event again...
Who's watching this while eating?
Let’s gooo
The fat antman supreme in the tatmanverse , you are so funny
Man, I’ve played more Fortnite in the last month, than the last 4 years.
I don't understand? This map wasn't even the OG fortnite
I'll miss the memories that got re-created with the boys
We will never forget the memories and friends we made along the way, gonna miss you OG map.🥹🥲
They need to make the OG map as a game mode. The customs in creative are all buggy
The beard ain't it fam
This is sad...😢,  ("Never say Never!!...")
bearded tim was goated
What would we do without recycled content
Sucks that OG is going away!
I will always miss og Fortnite with all of the memories I’ve had from 2017-2023 it has been one of the most life changing games because I’ve meet so many people where they’ve also changed my life all I want to say is I’m thankful for the experiences I’ve had on that og map in the game and also in real life so thank you. Goodbye Fortnite it’s been a great time with you wish you could’ve stayed longer
AWWWW Back when timmy played games lol
*thank you for Inspiring me to make Content again, I love you TimTheFatman*
Def will miss OG fortnite! - hope all is well Tim! Keep up the great work!
Howdy
It is a massive failure if they don't go back to their roots more in the future
I'm not a spam account like, also yes, this is a very emotional day
NOOOOOOOOOOO…what are they gonna do how can they top this season? What another star wars or marvel season💀
I liked my own comment
W timmy

I will quit if courage Jd gets a icon skin
