Wilkinson is insane. Idk how they manage to make such high quality parts for so cheap but they are not $30 parts once you use them they’re amazing
Do the strings still go through the body with the Vegatrem?
I put Gibson Humbuckers in my Telecasters..... Just need a screwdriver and some tape...... And brains of course.....  🤣🤣🤣
I'm going to tell Paul R. Smith that Pete said, unless you are a professional grade player don't bother buying a core PRS because you won't hear a difference anyway 😅
It's like two regular dudes just sitting around taking a stab at upgrading their guitars while they just sit about BSing, joking and chatting. Personally I believe they have a couple of pints sitting off camera. No prep, no directions, figure it out on the fly and hope it all works out....LOL. The best guitar store video program on youtube. These guys have an international following for a reason. They are normal, natural, spontaneous guys who enjoy guitar stuff.
Pete just hits all the right chords and notes all the time!!
Love love love Pete’s purple telecaster!!I loved it so much I had to get me one.
so you fast forward over the most interesting part which is them actually doing the modding?
Love that purple tele!!
I like Petes playing. And I  love me a nice tele. But I  also have to have a trem wiggle stick. So I thought I might try that Wilkinson trem system. But this is a two year old video, and I have noticed that that trem isn't on that purple tele anymore. So I  guess that answered my question. After trying it for a while, he obviously removed it.
You have to try IronGear pickups. English made.
Replaced my CS Gibson Les Paul's loom with Monty's and ( if you use your tone controls...) the difference was quite evident, well worth the effort.
That trem costs more than some guitars lol
I still laugh every time I watch this video 😂, you guys are Hillarious
I am hooked on Andertons TV. I am so glad I once bought an Epi G4000 from you and I have the super Andertons gigbag (probably my fav gigbag). I thought you were a little sho down south, picked you out at the time on my phone in a layby as I hurried up the road and my head was shouting Sg Sg SG. I don't like watching super content and giving nothing back, so three of the youtube teachers I follow (all in USA 2 in California) have had orders from me, even in the days of CD in the mail 5000 miles to me. I mainly love the guitars (just got a tele which is growing on me - 20 years after my G&L ASAT swamp ash and my Fender tele, both sadly departed) I do so enjoy Lee and of course mostly Danish Pete - and find both back stories fascinating. Shocked when Pete painted his purple tele!!!  Thanks guys, thank you so much.    Reply
Bunch of imbeciles 😂
I'm into these modding videos
Amazing Guitar sounds
pls stop the sex jokes. Its unprofessional and dorky.
So, what are those top secret pu's Pete's having. They sound lovely.
I'm a year behind on this, but having a censored (or uncensored for that matter) showed like every week and I'm glued the my monitor!!
I love that you both installed a new trem, and then had a jam in which neither of you use the trem!
Anyone know where Pete got the telecaster pickguard?
WTF that first jam was sick
Where did Pete get his gold scratch plate?
So the question about these guitars with push pull coil splits and lots of different split/combinations configurations is........ how many of those options do you actually use or do you stick to one or two
The Tele sounded more Strat and Strat became a Tele variation after modding dude. 😂
Some gold hardware on that tele would be the finishing touch.
The question is, did it stay on Pete’s guitar?
I do really love my 2018 Gibson LP standard. As it came with the PCBs hot swap. I just picked up the cables from eBay and order a pair of Pups to replace it on my own. Seymour Duncan’s Phat Cat neck and Custom Custom. Ordered additional tools to help setup the guitar as well. Modding is really fun, now will like to swap out the bridge to Faber or something else. Just didn’t like that the tailpiece is raised.
Nice I enjoy the mod videos. What brand guitar did lee mod?
Shame they don't do the VT2 in gold. All the accessories on my newly built tele are gold and black. They do not offer that option.
second floor, dummies 🤣
These guys enjoy saying "nut sauce" a little too much 😂
I could watch this all day. Thanks for all the great content you’re putting out. Greetings from Germany from a former drummer 😉
sometimes i can't help but stop to apreciate Lee's guitar progress in the last few years
Hey I bought one from you guys were your web site says no drilling into your beloved tele  and  no mods you order and pay for it and you HAVE TO DRILL IT and all the you tube vids show it won’t stay in tune  look your selves guys ,not fare when we trusted you!it’s still in the box can’t use it , scared to fit it ,and ruin a brilliant guitar  I hope you will reply LEE ?do you want this  piece of shit back ? Guess what vega said ?you pays you money you take your chance our wording has now been changed and a new models out sorry to be mis leading but Anderson’s sold it to you not us!  Very sad
how did pete get a purple Vintera roadworn 50s?!
I think this also goes to show that you can get a good crafted budget guitar and "mod" it. If china has a strat, and USA has a strat, and say they match each other on wood age, and humidity content at time of construction, wood grain, wood grain orientation, neck construction, and mid tier frets(that could be took care of at a later date) and same tonal fret board, china's would typically be cheaper allowing people to swap the pickups, hums, coils, and create the sound they want. They need to do a blindfold video where multiple people mod a guitar of their choosing and rate tone, play, feel etc. I know they have one or two videos on mods, BUT those I feel were done fast for content purposes. Take time, figure out what coils you want, my favorite mod layout was a single, coilover/silent single, and a humbucker. And dont add in Labor costs, my idea of someone modding in the first place is to save money and create a guitar that gives them their sound that can take them to new levels. We have youtube, so im sure a modder would utulize it and teach himself basic luther techniques.
Nah man. Andertons is fun to watch as always but modifying guitars is a waste of time and money. A cheap guitar is a cheap guitar in the end. And you NEVER EVER get your money back. Everrrrr. Just buy the best stock guitar you can afford.
The ease of Pete's VEGA-TREM VT2 install was a show stopper for me, I had no knowledge that these trems existed.  Thank you both for doing this Mod Show. Please do another.   Also could you talk Hiwatt Amplifier to create a Preamp Pedal like the Friedman IR-X but with the beautiful Hiwatt voicing.... please
I always find it interesting that the guys who can spend whatever they want on guitars find the most joy in the small stuff and tweaking it for their needs. I love that and Cap you have a fan in that.
They almost forgot to film putting nut sauce on the Sire and giving it the full Monty.
Instead of modifying a Strat, I just built a complete guitar from parts. I got a Highway One body from eBay, and a used MX Blacktop neck, Custom Shop 69 pickups (Abigail Ybarra), Fender staggered locking tuners, Wilkinson steel block trem, CTS pots, Oak switch, waxed cotton wire. I ended up with the exact guitar I wanted, for around the same price as a Mexican Strat. I'm well chuffed with it 👌
I love how Pete and Lee are man children. I feel a kindred spirit.
No before after??
"Partscaster" videos would be very interesting.
You didn’t really demo the trem systems in your jam sessions. May I ask why?
Pete just casually laying one guitar on the floor as he and Lee work on two others from their laps….just perfect.. Also….Lee watched Pete rub the neck like it was the Batwing from “Waiting”
Really enjoyed that, inspired me to get my strat inshape, so far iv polished frets,lubed nut, dressed fingerboard,tightned up screws and nuts, adjusted neck( acording to one of your previous videos), now im wanting to get another tremolo maybe. Fun video guys i needed the laughs. Well done.
Lee has an only fans page where he polishes his frets with nut sauce
You should do another episode like this I find it useful anyways. I think you should get Mason from Vertex Effects back on the show. He does guitar mods and makes patch cables and instrument cables too. Would be a cool video to watch. Love watching the show cheers from New Mexico USA.
I effing hate tremelos. I spent my childhood effing around trying to make a tremolo system perfect. I gave up in my teens. Never buy a guitar with a tremolo is my advice.
The 2 pick plates basically suck shit....just keep it purple
18:14 spot on. Being a better player raises the floor and ceiling. It's why, even though I really wanted it, I modded a squier mustang with p90s instead of buying the fender version. Saved me money and bc I'm so novice there's no difference to my ear or fingers
Ps purple rocks
Just,.....😂😂😂
Very sick mods, particularly the tele trem unit.  I have to ask though, does that arm get in the way of the knobs?
Hi Lee, could you just put the old gear back on the guitar so we can hear what it sounded like before you moded it for a comparison! Greetings from Australia Pete.
Next upgrade:  Zero frets!
I love that color! Purple and yellow is Louisiana state university football team colors and football as in American football 🏈
So that's where the nut sauce comes from.
Jesus guitar techs now
5:46 😂😂😂
Wow when you got those guitars modded you sounded like Billy peril and Jake the freight train break party doll gun cool
You guys told me I w o n something but I tried to reply but I don't think I did it right and I don't even know what I w o n?
You guys look like Daryl and Daryl from Daryl's how to build a chair with only three tools anyway good to see you can do your own mods there
Hi from Canada! You guys are my absolute favorite guitar/gear duo - I love your energy and the way you riff off of each other. And I should add that I drool shamelessly when I zoom in on all the beautiful equipment behind you... Cheers!
Where is the aged gold telecaster pick guard from please? Thanks
Wilkinson make great tremolo's: their premium ones are made at the Japanese Gotoh factory...
Frakencasters rock....So do good Chibson klones if done well...
I absolutely love modding videos! Planning one at the moment involving a bass 6, and a double humbucker conversion kit haha!
Yes , I’m new too all this … pls talk about just strings !
Effing Pete. 😂😂😂 The new pups sound awesome.
My purple road worn tele is sweet just the way it is. Good video though guys
My idea of modding is to put a sticker on my bass
I just finished a mod project on my Sterling by Music Man Ray35HH bass! I love the bridge pickup, in the classic Sting Ray position, but I never got on with the neck pickup. It was too muddy and wooly (and not in the good way), because it was positioned too close to the neck for my taste. I've always been a massive fan of P-Basses, and I had the idea to move the neck pickup to the "middle" position, right up next to the bridge pickup. So I bought a single-pickup replacement pickguard, and routed out the new placement. It turned out an absolute TREAT! The neck pickup now has more definition, clarity, punch, and heft - Like a P-Bass on steroids!
Come on, guys: balancing an instrument on your knees while (pretending to ... )working on it ... NEVER EVER have I seen such a low level of professionalism.
Lee's playing is so underrated he really milks the most out of every note his playing is joyfully simple but the way he   gets the most out of it is brilliant.
A good video would be to get four or five of your regular presenters and give you all the exact same guitar and then send you off to mod them and see what / why each of you have made the choices you have.
Great vid…you guys crack me up 😂
Great content! More of this type please!
Lee's playing has come on a long way.
If you're absolutely on a budget the buying a mid-priced guitar second hand and modding it. To be clear the difference between an upper end guitar and a cheaper guitar made of the same species of wood is that the derer one has a lot more hand finishing and the wood is likely better dried. Second hand the wood has settled so the neck won't move day to day, you can tidy the frets and upgrade what needs upgrading and you get everything on it you want. Comes to move it on you can take out what you put in and put the old stuff back in.
More modding videos please , maybe even building your own partscaster
I believe that Pete"s PU"s are TV Jones
i prefer push push alot easy to swap just solder one lug at a time one for one from the push pull
Vibramate Bigsby mount(no drilling)
Modding guitars can be dangerous in its own way.  Dangerously fun.  I started out just swapping pickups in cheap axes, and now I've built something like forty guitar and bass kits, specializing in figured veneers and uncommon stainjobs.
I love trem arms that are straight metal and dont have that plastic end. Just out of curiosity who prefers having that plastic end over just metal? Im just curious if im in the minority, or if most people prefer arms without the plastic, or if people dont care.
Loved this, can we have more mod episodes? Maybe a series of building a partscaster or something? Really good!
Love this video. You should do more mod videos like this
You guys cost me money every time I watch 😆.
Love that kind of vidéo remember me the one with Rob ltd tele
Lee you are the full monty
You guys work well together, a great team, thanks for the educational and entertaining video!
2 Bro’s goofing around and modding guitars. This is what we need. MORE OF THESE VIDEOS PLEEAASSEEE
Nitro spray something
That Strat with the tortoise shell pick guard is beautiful!
I have a JH reverse head MIM that I have Seymore D . Hot rails and a vega trem,,,,,,But I havent put it together yet,,,,lol
Great vid
It has to be said, the neck on that Sire looks phenomenal.
Awesome video :) as always.  I have a 2003 MIM Standard Stratocaster in Midnight Wine (rosewood fretboard) and I did some changes to it, rather to upgrade the playability, comfort and look. I somehow like the stock beefy sounding ceramic pickups, although I've never had any other Strat... So a real bone nut and a big brass block have been installed, the neck pocket has been cleaned out a bit. I did the fretwork with jumbo stainless steel fretwires and also rounded the edges, sanded the neck’s finish a bit. I've shielded the cavities and the pickguard with aluminium foil (not sure if it made any difference though). I've also installed Kluson Deluxe vintage tuning machines (with the white/cream pegs on them, which are basically for Mustangs and Duo-Sonics). Bending the strings is so much smoother with the giant stainless steel frets and the sustain is just great, the big brass block is a huge plus to the body instead of that stock scrap-metal thingy they used back then. I don't really like the poly finish but I do like the colour though. I recently installed new CTS pots and a CRL switch so now the pots are way more usable tone wise.
As much fun as doing an Airfix kit!
I have a Full Monty humbucker in the bridge position of my 335 - It is truly an epic sounding and oh so versatile pickup ❤
You need a work bench for things like this.
Darn! I have the vegatrem vt2 v1, which actually does drill into the tele. I didn't mind putting holes in the tele cause it was cheaper than the trem system, but the new design does make more sense.
please show us how to coil split a les paul. thanks!
You look like a chubby john mayer
If your mods include any items from the Danish Pete store I'd recommend against that... months later and no merch yet received, and the supposed email bounces back. I even wrote to Andertons and they said they would help me but still, nothing but crickets. Probably because I'm an American and won't likely come into the store, which is true.
n     u     t         s    a     u    c    e
I can't think of a job more fun to wake up everyday and get ready for.
To the youtube world:  If your floating trem feels too stiff for your liking, but is setup correctly as is, remove a spring from the back, tighten the trem claw until the trem is floating exactly where it was before. If you have a good trem, nut and string trees you may not even need to retune your guitar, but youll probably have to retune. Itll hold tune fine afterward, just take less force to use now. I play unusually light guage for my tuning on my strat, so i can get away with 2 springs without my trem feeling too wimpy or bends throwing it out too much
I think I speak for everyone here when I say, I should win that The Sheriff pedal. This is the way. 😄
Mod challenge!!!!  Both have the same guitar and have to get mods without seeing each others and then come back to see which is best! (Or most favoured!) 😂
I can crash a formula one car.... just as good as a formula driver... just saying....
finally sirs..  Finally a Modding ‘assembly-line’ within Andertons, sprinkled with you guys’ fantastic good humor . Thanks for this. Make it into a series !
Pete's trolling hard :D
The talented & musically inclined "Beavious & Buthead" Mod Show of the Guitar Shop that you wished you had in your neighborhood! I loved this episode, I have often thought the what if .  .  . . changing parts on my Gretsch for this or that & now I know it is possible!  Bravo Lee & Pete!!!
Hope to hear the purple Strat with the VegaTrem and the gold anodized pickgard very soon!
LMAO... This was like watching the old PG Tips ads. ;) Operating a soldering iron and filing wood whilst balancing the guitar on your knee... Reminded of the leg amputation scene in 'Carry On Jack'. 🤣🤣🤣
I liked Pete's explanation of being able to access the benefits of mods. I put Wilkinson EZ Lok pickups on a Squire Affinity Strat and it massively increased tuning stability which I could notice but I doubt I'd be able to tell the difference with a thicker neck plate unless was so big it got in the way of holding the guitar!
You just remined me of my vasectomy, made me shudder. I remember the surgeon saying "Tell me if you feel something sharp". 😪
My kind of show,, cheers guys🤟
Right, now put them back to how they were so we can compare… a B/A test.
In all honesty, I think I like the IDEA of modding guitars. As for actually DOING it, I don't have the dedication. I get as far as gathering the parts, then realize how much WORK will be required, then never start.
Semi-hollow pickup swaps but uncensored lol.
You should do another one of these, but down the pub after a pint or six
Where’s the Benny Hill cheeky chase soundtrack when you need it, eh?
that tele trem sure is a clever thing... also the finish of the sire is just gorgeous
Please put an anodized worn gold guard on that strat! It would look just as good as your Tele! Please I’m begging you Pete!
#DanishPete's favorite color is #PURPLE as in #DeepPurple and #PurpleRain  Today's magic word is #Nut_Sauce
floyd rose set up might be cool. Im scared to buy one but if i could set one up i might be tempted.
Tremelos are so over-rated. Unless you can do what Mr Beck and Mr Blackmore could, don't waste your money. You're better off with a hard-tail strat any day of the week.
When Pete turned around to rub his guitar he should've said "and that's how we get nut sauce." Missed opportunity Pete.
love the wanking jokes guys. keep it up
OMG i bought some monty's pickups. They are crazy good
Really love to watch you guys jam.
Ahhh   I see Beavis and Butt-Head are at it again. so who's Butt-Head  ? ? ? mmmm "It might get crazy" ! ! !
i love these kind of chill videos where lee and pete just talk bollocks and do something thats usually a tedious task
You guys have the coolest jobs ever. Super jealous to have a career you guys love.
This is how I built my 2 strats and 3 Teles. I just started modding some Mexican made Fenders and ended up with some fantastic instruments. This is some of my favorite content so far  Lollar pickups for the win :)
Pete and the captain are always fun to watch
NOT doing your work in a proper workshop on a proper worktable means you completely wrecked both of those poor guitars.
So Pete installed the VT-2"ND" (the No Drill version). That product is not on your website yet, correct?
A great video might be different resistor mods you can do (grease bucket, treble bleed). Or you could really set off the internet by testing if switch and pot replacement does anything
I could watch upgrade videos all day. Something cathartic to seeing other people do the work instead even though I like working on my own guitars 😁
Good grief. Never mod guitars with them sitting on your lap.  Modding your guitar is not hard. Unless you approach it like this. Find a proper work surface. On the plus side I guess guitar techs make a fair proportion of their living by fixing things that people working like this have screwed up.
Excellent video. How bout a video discussing neck conditioning, polishing and general cosmetic care of your guitars? Maybe combine it with general amp, pedal and other gear maintenance stuff?
I just noticed that Pete's Strat has a tele headstock on it. Im curious to know what that is??????
Yes  ⚡👩‍🎤🤘👨‍🎤⚡
This is my Jam man! I'm a sucky player but modding is my thing. Awesome Video 👏👏👏👍
Tone is in the calluses
I love this style of guitar video - more freeform - feels like hanging out with mates talking about your hobby. More mod videos!
Haven’t enjoyed one of your vids as much as the old one where Chappers and The Captain modded budget guitars. Cap installed a mid boost in a strat I believe. Some of the most enjoyable content!!
I’m the original Full Monty. From Chelsea.
The things I get up to during these videos maaan ,😏,
here for the Dane <3
great work guys !!! ...I have been modding and donating  inexpensive  guitars here in Chicago to teens in local music programs  for decades....nothing  more fun then trying  different  modd concepts  on as many  of guitars as possible!....great fun guys!...much love n respect!
Great Show, hope I win the pedal! 😊🎸🔊 🎶 🎵. 🎤✌️
Video Suggestion : how to fix your Les Paul’s tuning problems. As you know every YouTube Guitarist makes a video on this subject but usually just says do x. Many are attacking the problems (there’s usually a couple) in different ways. I tried a string tree type device with almost no effect. I removed that then I tried filing the nut. Helped but not much. Then I tried 3 in 1 and boom it worked. So maybe a video on A) How to identify what’s wrong and B) how to fix it. The file your nut videos tend to not be detailed and I can see how many could mess this up. Heck, I may very well have. And since Gibson no doubt watches the show suggest how they can fricking fix this joke of a problem that every other guitar manufacturer no longer has while remaining “Authentic”! 😆 Thanks as always guys.
I'm always interested in seeing what other people like to change about a guitar to make them their own.  Any chance of seeing what other Andertons presenters would do in a similar vain?  Making it a challenge could be fun, especially if you did something like everyone starts with an East Coast S type or something similarly budget friendly.
Love British humor, or humour
Pete said it . Did you catch it. The tone is in the fingers.
thanks, really enjoyed this ....
The gold scratch plate looks shitty. White is infinitely better
All the oneliners!!! . My fav is gotta be the one about Nut sauce!
In my eyes Pete's tele trem not a proper mod. If you haven't drilled a hole doesn't count to me 😂
Defo gold guard on the strat
Is there a left handed version of the tele tremolo?
I customised my Chapman ML2
Petes tele looks super cool !
Well......Boys the next vid is going to HAVE to be your own "partscasters"...dontcha think? I actually have Full Monty's in my partscaster...astonishing P/ups.
Awesome video I really enjoyed it
So that Vega trem is going on a hardtail string through guitar?
I put ICON PLATES on all my bolt on neck guitars. They have a bunch of styles. Flames, Rose, peace sign, radioactive, all kinds. I love them!!
The only downside to mod affordable guitar is for the resale value because lots of time the buyer doesn't want to pay what you did.
Yes please, more maintenance and mods
Where did Pete get his worn gold scratch plate?
The talk about putting Lewis Hamilton in Pete’s Citroen made me think they should do a reasonably priced guitar bit for famous guitarists that come into the shop.
Teletrem is a nice and smart piece of engenering.
I can’t believe you use a clumsy multi tool instead of a professional and correctly sized screwdriver. One slip  is all it takes.
Love these tinkering vids, more pls
I put a silver sparkle pickguard on my purple tele. Monty's pickups too.
#facepalm It’s the “second floor”….and you probably need to have grown up in the 80s to get the reference. Still funny.
I love Pete's pick of Lee, He looks like a bit of a droogy don't you think.  Somewhere Stanley Kubrick is smiling.  Brilliant video guys,  you're pretty good at this stuff!  ;-)
I must be alone here, but what it is about roasted maple necks that people love so much?  I think it looks horrible.  I'll get my coat...
So tempted by that Vega Term! What's the difference between the modern and vintage ones? It's it screw hole spacing?
The most creative viewing since Blue Peter built Tracey Island from a shoe box and squeezy bottles. Thunderbirds Are Go!
I bought an EastCoast tele a few months back and modded the hell out of it, I probably spent more on parts than I did for the guitar.
My God guys.. what have you done?
Video's of modding and repairing or upgrading guitars are my favorite. Both trem systems look very innovative and could improve the guitar's performance. The new Tele Vega Trem is genius , but also a bit pricey. Great video guys.
You guys are pretty much Pat and Mat from the animated childrens show 😄
Neck plates are the biggest upgrade you can make
Them pick ups are the same as his signature Chapman arnt they?
Being in the US, I really struggle with understanding what the British mean when they say a pickup is “pokier”? Does this mean more harsh? More treble? Higher output? Please explain. TY
My favorite mod is Mega Switch P-Model on H-H guitar. Basically it's a PRS's configuration on 5-way switch. It might not work as well as the real PRS though.
Guitar mod videos are my favorite things to watch, besides Pete playing guitar and cracking jokes. 🎸
Next video .   The captain , hand carves a floyd rose , cut out , into the custom shop Greeny . 😂😂😂😂
My biggest pet peeve regarding guitar modifications and upgrades is terminology. It's not a tremolo unit... it's a vibrato.
Suhr hardware is probably made in Germany by Schaller, the same as Fender hardware is. I have exactly that colour purple paint - been wondering what colour to paint my beaten up strat, thanks, looks awesome!
Just finished modding my Sire H7V w pup upgrade, all nickel parts, and gold top hats with thumb bleeders - so basically a 330/Casino-fication. Looks  outstanding! (Sounds great too, but come on - looks...) So, you appreciate these vids all the more
Tremolo on a tele "get away! the devil's work!"
9:49  I love watching Pete having a go at Lee. "DoNt ClIp It"
What are they rubbing the neck with and why?
they look like the CuNiFe (-sp?) fender pickups Edit: Just went back to that vide and I guess not.. Those were white.
If I turn round and go like this 😂x
Don’t clip it!!! 😂😂😂
I thoroughly enjoyed the video, and it was hilarious as well. I hope you do more "mod" videos. I've done a lot of mods on my guitars to get the sound, features, and playability that I want. Thanks
Ive modded a few Guitars in my time and I really enjoyed it  , its nice to know how something works or is put together  . I have always wanted to build my own Guitar but that's a few dreams away for me  , instead I will buy a Guitar build kit and modify it as I go . I know how to File Frets to a playable finish and  I can roll the edges of a Fret board for that played in feel , but thats my limit .
I am trying to mod a chapman ML2,  finding a wiring diagram was hard, I have bought Seymour duncan pick ups, any help would be nice guys
Lee Pete what guitar is the best and why Sire S7 or S3 or Squire classic vibe strat 50s or 60s.???? Cheers. Gaz the gut.
Eyes buff innit bruv
Really enjoyed hanging out with you guys while you modded your guitars, thanks for letting me look over your shoulders.
Interesting tremolo on tele 🤔 I love moding my guitars ! I moded my very first guitar , an Epiphone SG G-400 with a vibramate Bigsby and humbucker size P90 from french brand Asylum Pickups, and now it's the guitar I use more , I love it 🎸🤩
Switched the crappy trem on my project Squier... Man, the difference is unbelievable!
Thats the funniest video of the year! Thank you! Lees face only one backplate was classic! You tell him Pete, only one and you´re not having it boss, owner of the company, its MINE! 🤣🤣🤣
Darrell Braun made a video about that tremolo a couple weeks ago.  Works great.
Cool mods. I’m looking forward to seeing those guitars used in pedal and amp demos.
NIce to watch a video of two men rubbing wood.
Love the roasted maple neck on the Sire. And talking of absolute roasters, where is Rob Chapman these days?
Guys, Luka lives on the SECOND floor!
I loved this and the really old video of Lee and Rob modding some guitars so definitely more of these! Would be fun to see both start on the same guitar and mod them with a certain amount of money and see how different it would be between the two of you!
The sire has stainless steel frets?
Nice Rolex on Lee's wrist. Business seems to boom !
Lol.....be careful when you're rubbing that neck....you could get the nut sauce everywhere!
For me, modding is about two things. Guitar play-ability and guitar sounds. A guitar has got to feel right - a good setup is important and you have to have it so it stays in tune after some vibrato and it feels easy to play. The "sounds" could be a secondary thing as a guitar could go through many FX/EQ pedals/amps etc. If the guitar feels good and it becomes the first choice when you want to pick up and play, then you're most of the way there. More modding vids please. :)
will you restock the Epiphone 1959 Les Paul?
Hopefully these guys are not the Techs working at Anderton's.😮
The gold pick guard looks right at home. Did you lay a mint guard to see what that looks like?
I wouldn't let these salesmen near any of my guitars, jesus.
imagine thinking that changing a little metal plate with another little metal plate would influence the sound of an electric guitar in any way.😅
Does the vega trem on the Tele make it top load or are there passages through the springs?
Pete, wtf? lol.  I like the new twist on guitar magic he put here where if you can't tell that one guitar is definitely better/different than another because a screw is a different material or whatever it is because you aren't a good enough player to express the difference in your playing.  That has to be the most elitest thing I have ever heard.  I can understand from a functional point of view that certain things a more advanced player may brush against a less advanced one wouldn't, but the idea that general tone and sound of the guitar can only be truly coaxed from the wood, metal, and wires by a true believer, I mean professional, is hilarious.  I love Pete, but come on, that is massive cope.
I love listening to these guys jam. Pete is an incredible freestyler!
19:34 Danish Pete-ups?
My favorite hobby is fixing old cars and motorcycles.  So tinkering on a $50 Strat is what got me into the hobby.  I set up the guitar with a bone nut better tuners, some mint plastics, etc.  The Leo Fender lineup was conceived by engineers for modular mass production.  That design philosophy makes them perfect for modifying and upgrading.   Try doing that with an acoustic, haha.  I agree with Pete that Lee's guitar would look better with antique white pickup covers.  Bright white plastic makes Strats look cheap.
Ye i try to avoid these modded guitars ppl dont know what theyr doing :D
That will be the Chapman pups then.
Andertons should start selling some premium DIY build your own guitar kits... and they should launch them with these two characters building them. Great content and a new revenue stream ;)
These tele trems are not good. Very unusable compared to the strat Vega stuff
Lotsa fun in these vids, just wish there were a 'before' clip as comparison.
Cap and Danish Pete, the naughty sessions...lol  Pete, sell me your old tele bridge so I can have some Pete mojo.
wow pete thats a cool mod on tele :) i like mr lee's Outro
All Mod Cons. Tool Time with Tim Allen & Richard Karn. Do y’all work on your own cars ? Is Pete’s purple ?
Always great to see Lee and Pete having a wonderful time playing with their tools.
What pickups you got in there Pete? “Oh just some im trying out”  Those are my fav
Dispicable Lee 😂
Nice modding ... the Vega on the Tele is a great piece of engineering  ... love it  Thanks a lot for sharing
Such a funny video guys!😂
This kind of content is amazing
Did you fast forward through the oiling of your nuts?
Already one of my rewatchable guitar vids
Next level: blindfolded modding.
Danish Pete should get a gold anodized pickguard for that Tele-necked Strat only if he replaces all the metal hardware with gold-plated equivalents: tuners, jack and jackplate, tremolo, neckplate, etc.
sad that the Vega-Trem for Tele is not available for left handed players...
I’m modding a guitar atm and love watching videos about it and quite difficult to find content like this on yt we need moreeeee
I'd like to see the two of you adjusting nut and saddle on a new acoustic guitar. Straight edge, sanding paper and the like.
I'd personally love you guys taking multiple identical models of whatever guitar, to mod each of them differently (different neck plate, different pickups, different bridge...) and test it blindfolded to see if you feel or hear a difference!
There's no such thing as a spare Telecaster, they are all needed!
Smart content! The more people know how to mod their guitars...
So funny I was just looking at a Vega term sitting on my shelf thinking I need to install this!
*Insert Jeremy Clarkson “What could possibly go wrong” GIF*
Wilkinson saddles not on the website....😢😢
I've always thought Anderton's needed a mod show. Get someone to switch out parts and teach wiring, and demo pickups.
If win that klon I would trade it in for a custom shop stratocaster
The necks maybe great on the S7, but oh my how bad was the neck and frets on the S3 I took a punt on, well let's just say it went straight back!
Pete should mod his Tele by spraying it a different colour :))
Wait... did Pete skip the part where you have to drill two holes in the guitar for the trem? I got one of these and was disappointed to realize you have to drill two new holes into the tele body.
One of the beautiful things about Fender based guitars is just how much you can modify them and make them your own.
Blue Peter must be shitting themselves!
**Ball-dering Iron**🤣🤣🤣
I can see it now. Tales from the Mod Shop! 😊
coolio guys vid fab.
Would be cool to see you guys in with Phillip McKnight from Know Your Gear.
Great video guys haha. Do I smell a new series in this? 😉
Nice mods Gents! 🤓👍 I've been using the Wilkinson Locking Saddles on Gotoh 510 trem (Favourite combo so far).  Excellent tuning stability (as long as your nut is cut well mind 😜)
Pete's mystery pickups living in my head rent free
Roadman Pete isn't real, he can't hurt you
Love this kind of content 😁
Glad to hear the swearing quotient has been upped. The channel was becoming way too wholesome for my liking.
yesterday i saw a cool picture of a wasp on a penis
Go listen to Pandora’s Box by Aleks Hart
I was literally searching guitar mod videos.
