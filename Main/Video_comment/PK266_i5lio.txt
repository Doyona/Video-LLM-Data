FIVE NIGHTS AT STITCH
FIVE NIGHT AT Stitch
Abandoned by Disney
Bro looked like springtrap
fnaf fans: WELL I WONDER WHY
Fazbear’s Attraction gotta be worse
Five nights at stitches
He looks like something out of FNAF
I think the chargers melt inside the stich
POV dinsey:guys we are in. FNAF  we need to get out
So this is the next Fnaf animatronic 😂
Tgbs b😮jhjjbjjgha    Dcnckvjgbla😂 gostei de três estrelas ggk👎🙏
2025 now he sounds completely different
Really Creepy, Where Did The Person Who Put The Photos Online Find Stitch's Animatronic?
I think the ride was great. People disliked the ride because it used to be better ride based off the alien universe that was MUCH scarier. If it was just a new addition, people would have received it better, but it was a ride replacement
Old zackdfilms videos are fire
Also, there was a “animated” analog horror about somebody going backstage of that ride in finding that animatronic still working my brother says “ it’s AI. There are no videos of the animatronic plus his tongue disappears.” so yeah.
2016 was when I was born 😱
😢
They broke it
Didn't know stitch was built like a mimic😅

Alien encounter was bad aliens ran around the park attacked the people so Disney decided to get rid of it and make stitch great escape.
Bro really is a "zombie robot"
....
The FNAF comments are creative.

Naah that’s stitch strap
Some girls: stitch is so cute 🥰   The animatronic of stitch: 💀
NOOOOO I hope they will fix it 😢
The Alien Encounter attraction it replaced was way better, but I think Disney decided it was too scary for Magic Kingdom. Also the pre-show video featured Jeffrey Jones, who became a bit problematic in the early 2000s.
Are we nit gonna talk about the guy named mew
He does not look lije thay!!!😢
FNAF after a year of Russia

The night guard already has to deal with 6000 you don’t have to add withered animatronics
He's more like springtrap
Stitch  still cute. I don’t care.❤
Broken stitch ❌ Stitchtrap ✅
This looks like Springtrap
Loved this ride😢
You’ll be a night shift guard The animatronics here do tend to wander a bit
It's a melted gremlin.
That's a spring lock suit
A worn down animatronic, NO girl haven, YES
bro was reincarnated to something that is ugly as hell 😢
That looks weird
I went disney and saw that anamatronic in a bin i shat my pants how creepy it is-
THE RIDE IT WAS BEFORE STITCH WAS GENUINELY THE BEST I LOVED IT  IT WAS A SCARY EXPERIENCE AND IT WAS PERFECT  IT NEEDS TO GO BACK TO THAT
The previous ride it was before stitch was WAYY BETTER
I remember sitting in the original attraction during a family trip to Disney World. We went in the summer time and had a bunch of hand towels to be our sweat rags, and unfortunately the chili dog scent that got sprayed at us during the ride got on our towels, so you can image how bad the smell of sweaty chili dogs was whenever we went to pat down our faces. Needless to say, we didn't eat chili dogs for dinner for a few years after that lol
HADEAN EON: HHAAHHAHAHAHAHA
I road it, I still think it was amazing. I'm sad it's gone
Fnaf
That thing looks like it could be in a horror game
Imagine if stitch was in fnaf universe meaning five nights at Freddy’s.
“i am very green but im mean”
STOP COMPARING DISNEY ANIMATRONICS TO FNAF!
They made him soooooo dirty💀🙏
NEEGAAA     Or whatever stitch said

😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Long time ago do not worry about that you know I will get you some thing
DONT CALL HIM TERRIFYING HES CUTE IN ANY WAY
…
I remember riding this ride as a kid…
Stitchtrap
“ Ohana means, “ha ha h- ,springlocks and instant regret”
The fact is, all of those criticisms are from the adult Disney-goers. I've been to Disney World twice in my life, both times as a kid, and I recall the excitement and fear 😂 I felt when Stitch was "moving around" the facility. Burping in peoples faces and running underneath seats. I went to that attraction each time I visited and will always recall this ride when its mentioned.
lol my god lol how❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😅😅😅😅😮😮😮😮😮😢😢😢😢😢
😱😱😱😱😱😱😣😣😣
❤️😂😮
He died 😭😭😭
It’s walking animatronic you know how hard they worked on that to say it’s garbage

“We found one. A real one.”
“I always come back” ahh image 😭🙏
They turned stitch into springtrap
That would not the worst attraction
Bro is the new scrap trap
“Five nights at stitche’s great escape” ahh moment
Stitch👎 Stitchtrap✅️
Stitch: l i l o  h e l p  m e
Pov disney buys fnaf:

Zombie stitch be like
"But then these photos leaked online" with no further explanation makes the entire thing way creepier imo
scitchtrap
Stich mehhh phantom stich yeaaa
Its all shits and giggles when you become a night guard
Do you like your videos but your videos suck
It’s cool keep it like that
Stich still looks like a dead springTrap
Stitch trap is crazy
My stepmom loves Lilo and Stitch n they do this to him at Disneyworld!?
They could’ve given me the animatronic I love the stitch. I love 626.
I don’t care what them **** people say I that looks like a fun ride me and my future child love it. I don’t care what them people say.
I don’t care what them **** people say I that looks like a fun ride me and my future child love it. I don’t care what them people say.
Lol if anyone thinks this is creepy, clearly they never experienced the ride Alien Encounters which is the ride Stitch replaced. Scarred me for life.
Is that creepy stitch animatronic when it’s broken? That thing looks entirely like spring trap? It’s got the same rusty stuff on it. It’s got the green stuff and some of the wires make it look like this fleshing and someone could have got spring locked or what if they did?
Yep💀
Oh my God, what happened to my boyfriend?
😢
LUCK AT THAT FUCKING STICH😮
The OGs know that this would’ve been in FNATI
Why he look like Springtrap from fnaf 3
You will be payed 10 dollars an hour and the animatronics will come alive and eat you, good luck!
No bro, that stitch trap
So scary 😰😰😰
That thing is terrifying
I remember going in there, but I don’t remember what it was like.
Scott Cawthon has just leaked a collab with Disney
why sitch has no cover for animatronic
rip stitch....
Bro cane back for like 2025 about the movie
2005: stitch is getting built 2010: stitch ride has flopped 2015: stitch will be closed away in a year 2020: ahhhhhhhhhh
I feel so bad for the people who worked on this.   Imagine creating the most advanced animatronic in the world, which by modern standards still looks amazing from that old footage, only for the ride it was made for to be such a dud that they pull the plug on it and leave the animatronic to rot.
Now I’m scared to go to Disneyland💀
Stitch
Withered stich
Your just jealous of lilo and Stitch
Bro why does stitch look like spring trap from Fnaf three💀
using that thing for a horror attraction would honestly go hard
I love you stitch ohana

“just be cautious, the animatronics can shapeshift
I actually went to that attraction and still remember it very clearly, it was actually funny in some cases, other times though when you could feel something rumbling around the seats (it was stitch) then it scared the crap out of everyone in the attraction
Five nights at stitch will be a great game
Zombie stitch
Five nights at Disney
That’s why I hate stitch

#burntom
when i went to Disney for my 8th birthday,, the person dressed as “Stitch” accidentally backhanded me across the face while they were giving my stepdad a high five. ill never forget that. hurt so bad but i pretended like nothing happened.
WAS THAT THE BITE OF [[Stitches great escape]]
This is the predecessor of an attraction named alien encounter, which was supposed to be a horror themed ride at the park so that adults could have fun at the park and have a thrilling experience and not just be doing kid rides, but they realized it wasn’t the greatest ideaso they eventually had a lot of problems with it and they took it down and replaced it with this and yeah
He’s not terrifying! He’s cute the way he is!❤
Poor stitch 😢😢😢
Makes sense. Did the ride in Orlando. Was honestly rubbish
Stich trap 😂
Not me seeing this in 2025 UR VOICE IS SO DIFFERENT
The first pic looks like an ai picture like someone prompted animatronic stitch with exposed hardware or animatronic stitch broke down in the 80s
“Stitchtrap”

Stitch from fnaf3 in Disney world 💀
“Making us think that this attraction might be gone for good” Stitch: I always come back.
What did they d-do to ME

That is a robot you type of people it is stitch and make it in the movie here if people watch it that describe people in a bad body and people stitch… That woman is putting people in here put their medicine again
Yo lowk the stitch walking in one of the clips was smooth asf
I remember seeing this with my own eyes....I thought that ride was pretty cool. I went on it with my parents the only time I went to Disneyworld.
I DONT THINK HE WILL COME BACK ANYMORE💀
I always come back ah
It’s really sad cuz the movements of the robot were kinda good😔
Springtrap in Disneyland
Why did I know this was a zackdfilms video because of the title
Bro came out straight out of Fazbears Fright 💀💀
“Your *just an attraction*-in my amusement park”
Bro I thought that was springtrap at the start! 😅
That is not true he is actually lying which is the beautiful thing wit people keep talking about this beautiful stitch😢😢😢

Spring trap❌ Spritch✅
Kinda familiar to FNaF 3
2016 is died Stitch
In 2002 the park was open
0:00 just got
This is Stitch look like ln Disneyworld
Closed today and  stitch is died
I don't know why it closed. I'm because of these stupid people who want it closed and I bet they're just happier. I know that's closed even though I'm not because I'm a stitch fan and I literally have a stitch piggy, big, a stitch figure and I made myself a lego stitch, so that's why and this is why it should not be closed. They should reopen it. And I really want to go see it!!!
New episode: Five nights at Stitches
LiLo
In 2015 my dad (who later I would block for gaslighting and other things) brought me to Disney world. I went on this ride.
What the hell happened to stitch😭
Stitchtrap
Walt disney done said "i always come back" making that creepy ass creation
Oh damm
soy un perdedor
Five night at stitchs
Right after watching Lilo and Stitch in class i see this…
others:what happened to stitch fnaf fans:IS THAT SPRINTRAP????
“The animatronics get a little quirky at night” 😂😂
By Cheesecake hell nah
The animatronics tend to get a bit…quirky
Five nights at stitch’s
Bro stitchtrap😭 we are cooked yall he gonna get a bit quirky at night
I remember watching horror stories about it 😂😂😂
Stitchtrap isnt real. It cant hurt you. Stitchtrap:
Brocken Stitch ❌ Stitchtrap✅
Why does stitch looks like a Springtrap fnaf thing
I didn’t realize this was Zack
What haters think of Stitch lately:
13 years and 1 month and 21 nights at stitch 3
I was only 5 when I road that ride I liked it but yet again I was just obsessed with creepy things
Stitch-trap
Stitch-trap
That scary blue koala
“stitchtrap” lookin ahh
that's sad
Yiy
LILO DONT LEAVE ME HERE (bang) (bang) (bang) LILO DONT LEAVE ME HERE
Where is William Afton
I went on that ride back then, it was pretty terrifying when they turn all the lights off for a couple minutes and  when he spits on you and scare you from behind a couple times
I mid his old vids
STICHTRAP?!?!
Stitchtrap 🗣🔥
Endo 02
SPRINGTRAP?!?!??!
Holy watching this in 2025 makes me realize how much zacks voice changed
I don't want to say this but this video is a little stupid guys don't believe this stupid things aliens are not real Stitch is just an Disney character who is not even in real life is it Snow White real no Snow White and Stitch and any other Disney cartoons are just some stop that Disney workers did in a laptop that's all it's not even true😂
Springtrap:are they mocking me!?
spring stitch
Daim ditch you went RIP mode😮😮
Night security guard try to survive the five nights at stitch’s
I went on that when I was 2 years old 😂 It wasn’t that bad it even spits on you
I worked that attraction back in 05. It really was lame. I used to ad lib to make it better. I'd stay in the chamber until the lights went out, slide into a hiding place, then "drop from the ceiling" by jumping and landing just as the lights come on.
Stichtrap
the real live action lilo and stitch also, who else noticed that this is zack D films?
No stitch why why😭
Why does he sound like Thatv
Bro this is giving me ahhh Springtrapp vibes
Five Nights at Freddy's Be Like:

Stitchtrap:i always come back
POV stitch lovers 😭😭😭😭😭💀💀😭😭💀😭💀😭💀💀😭
Springtrap reincarnated as a Disney character 😭😭😭
Nah, this is not spring trap, this is stichtrap

Is it just me or does Zack kinda sound different?
I always come back
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 stitch. Are you OK?
I would have went and loved it

zombie stitch❌ stitchtrap✅
"The animatronics do get a lil bit crazy for 10 seconds tho"
Five nights at stitch’s great escape
“i always come back...”...
😢😢😢😢😢😢 so sad ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I will tell you this, as someone who was on that "ride". It wasn't actually bad! BUT, it was terrifying for kids. And the even bigger BUT, was there was a scene where he escapes and eats someone's nachos (bear with me) and burps. Disney decided it would be a great idea to pump in the smell of a nacho cheese burp, and to this day, I still remember it. Nobody in my family ate after that for a while, and it still haunts me
Buddy got springlocked
“I always come back”

This is what stitch looks like in Disney World and I’m gonna explain you why this terrifying Phoenix in 2002 the film section success that Disney rushed and entrance into the park. The attraction was called stitches, greatest escape and they made us 39 inch stitch animatronic was complex animatronic in the world, but unfortunately for Disney stitches greatest escape is a major flop. Well it was called the worst attraction that Disney have ever made 2016 the company said that they have seasonal operation that is temporarily closed and this attraction might be gone for good.😬😳😱😥😰😟😨🙀😧🫢🫣🫨

💀💀💀
A new live action lilo & stitch movie is coming out this month May 23rd do you think Disney would will make a new attraction out of this new lilo and stitch live action movie
Why does he sound so different?
They should make a stick ride and bring it back . Then it would be a Hawaiian roller coaster ride
Fwi they look could look creepy to people as they were scrapped for parts as they were very very expensive where else most of the metal would cost more to melt down then to just let them sit in a under room(areas under the park)
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😳😳😳😳😳😳
Ferk is scay
Springtrap
Thang god that happend to it
Oh hell no
Naw bro its fnaf irl 😂😂😂
The entire fnaf 6 speach because why not  Connection terminated. I am sorry to interrupt you Elizabeth. If you still even remember that name. But I’m afraid you’ve been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here but the individual you assume. Although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sound and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit; a maze with no prize.  You don’t even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children and some unseen chamber always seeming so near… yet somehow out of reach. But you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends.  And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that’s… not what you want. I have a feeling that you are… right where you want to be.    I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this will finally fade away, as the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors- be still, and give up your spirits. They don’t belong to you.   For most of you, I believe there is peace, and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although for one of you, the darkest pit of hell has opened to swallow you whole… so don’t keep the devil waiting, old friend.   My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It’s in your nature to protect the innocent. I’m sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you? I should’ve known you wouldn’t be content to disappear. Not my daughter.  I couldn’t save you then, so let me save you now. It is time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms. This ends for all of us.   End communication.
Haters Created Monsters in the First Place
Looks cool a f m who cares. ET is ugly af

Ngl I kinda wanna go in the stich thing, but when it looked better😭🫶🏼🩵
😮😮😮😱😱😱😱
Terrifying thing? He's still adorable anyway and in a different planet ❤️
If you combined the power of animatronics, puppetry and cgi, the result would be so surreal it would change the game forever.
This ride was the replacement of another ride,  Extraterrestrial Alien Encounter, and it was the most horrifying ride made by Disney. Cause it took place in the dark using 3D sound, water jets and air to simulate an alien monster escaping and attacking or licking guests.
Hell naw they done turned Springtrap into a Disney animatronic
Great. No, thanks to a bunch of jerk, people dissing on people's hard work. No one will ever see that.
Wth did they do to stitch

Whoa, this new Fifty DayShift at Fredrick’s Fazblender’s character looks spooky. I shiver in me boots.
I think this attraction scared me in the past. Because I remember going to a stitch attraction probably when I was a kid. And it was very loud and there was a stitch in animatronic. And there was also smoke. And I just remember being scared of the ride.
NOOOOOOOO😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤢😭😭😭🤢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤢😭
You left out the coolest part of the story about the original ride

How do we fart
I actually did ride this a while back, it’s cool the lights cut out and he crawls on the ceiling and drools on you
In 2002 the film was soo good that made a ride called stitches great escape. But it was the worst attraction ever and in 2016 they shut down it because it was in a seasonal operation and close it. But then these photos were found. Meaning that this attraction is gone for good.
I really hate stitch I wish stitch was never found or existed.
No it dosnt ive been
If you dint read the sign it did say on the loose so the stitch animatronic might had moved in the ride by itself
I though stitch was cute-❤

History repeating its self
İt is animatronic
The animatronic at the end looks like something out of Five Nights at Freddy's
They've massacred ma boi😢
Bruh y'all hate on that ride, it was a baby version of the 90 ride of the alien ride that terrified everyone. Y'all it’s a small world is still in that damn park! It’s a small world is by far the worst ride in magic kingdom.
Sthich no
Always in 2016. I was BORN IN 2016
Stitch trap
hes so ugly I love him
You missed the first part, originally the ride was called Alien Encounter, when the Stitch film came out it was repurposed around Stitch, I think one of the biggest reasons it failed was that most guests had already experienced the second act of the ride as Alien encounters. Yes, the animatronics were great, but really it was still the same ride as Alien Encounter
Bro, I went on this ride. It was actually terrifying because the animatronic was actually huge.😰
I wish I was born in that year  because I am a big fan of  stitch and l was born in 2017 January  4
Stitch is not  terrifying and he’s not a thing he’s ohana  means family
that's just springtrap's history
The animatronics do git a bit quarky at night
Looks like springtrap
“Animatronic” is this five nights at Freddy’s?
… what the hell!

Nightgaur checking it out scary but cool (stich) hello bitch
I remember going on this ride in 2016, my first time at Disney and it was one of my favorite rides because I loved Lilo and Stitch and then in 2023 when I returned with my family it was gone. I always wondered what happened to it.
Nah we got stitch , but we got stitchtrap
Nah that Stitchtrap💀
I love stitch so much 😢
Bro???
❤
Hell nah is that stichtrap or springstich
I can’t find a comment that isnt abt fnaf, so here’s mine 👹👹👹 “THERE IS ONLY ONE RULE- KEEP THE RIDES *ON*.”
I actually liked the attraction, I loved the stitch animatronic as a kid
He looks like spring trap
The first ever time I watched him
Naw that dying anamatronic is kinda cute
Wiliam afton uses the stitch suit to to killing the children in Disney World 💀🙏
I would of loved to see to see this is disneyworld when I was young but my family said it was too expensive to go to Disneyworld I’ve never been
My teacher told me about this she said I'm pretty sure it would like the likes would go out and stitch would go behind someone and like stroke their ear and when the lights go out u would just here glass shatter and the lights turn on stitch would be gone...
Ok just this one never ever bring him up again like that 👎🏽
stitch got springlocked!

Fun fact: Stitch’s great escape is a re-paint/re-designed version of an old space themed ride called “extraterrestrial alien encounter” that was shut down for being too dark for Disney.

IM OSWALD 🗡️
erm... what the sigma??
Why
Stay calm, everyone. Just stay f****** calm.😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰
So Disney World was created by two Men Vanja And Walt And for the first attraction they made a lilo And stich park with spécial mechanics but in 2004 Vanja wanted a revenge for unkown reasons so he killed Walt's son so he wanted to kill another one so he did And put it in a Lilo animatronic possesing Lilo animatronic with to Ghosts but one day in 2020 Vanja was caught by the Ghosts of the dead Kids And went into the stich animatronic but the mechanisims trapped Vanja in the stich animatronic killing him "slowly" but the Disney entertainment Had other plans And made him get a second life as the Stich Animatronic And Vanja renamed himself as Stichtrap. No one knows where he Is even today some people Say that he Is in the Disney castle or in the park that was abonded but if you tell me i would say that that Is just a theory... A Game theory.
I’m offended 😡
This is so sad what happened to stitch
Might be gone for good? DUDE, that's just robots, thrown in a scrap yard. Why do people find garbage terrifying?
Someone should make a game of this…
😭😭😭😭😭
And Plus he is really cute as an animatronic but really who wants to do that
I hate it because stich should colorful not brown who wants to go there to see dead stich😢😢😢😢
Wasn’t that the attraction where at once point Stitch jumped into the Disney castle and the crowd got sprayed with water? Cuz if so, I loved that attraction as a kid.
Wait so it was considered the worst attraction in the Park’s history: so they kept it open and running for 15 years? That doesn’t compute.
Stitch originally looked cool
Why does it looks like Springtrap? 😂😂😂
I saw that sign when i went there never got to enter as it was closed

POV:FNAF (stitch’s version)
Disneyland was slowly turned into fnaf
Yesss yesss biz de inandıl😂
I love stitch
Before the stitch ride, they had a much scarier version called “extraTERRORestial alien escape” I think  It was widely known to be MUCH scarier and was taken down because of how many complaints parents had because it traumatized there children.!those same kids (who are now adults) want it back but with an age limit instead of just warning signs
no i remember going on this for like my 3d or 4th birthday , so excited , came off crying my eyes out because stitch sniffed my shoulder/hair from behind me and i was horrified for the rest of my life. that’s all i remember from going to disney LITERALLY nothing else , just being absolutely horrified im fixing to be 19 and id still never get on ts again 😂😂😂😂
I remember going to this a year before it closed and I was terrified. I was only 6.
bro became withered stitch💀
I got to ride the stitch ride a week before it closed in 2016. I was so scared though I didn’t wanna ride it. But the exact day that it closed down was the day I wanted to ride it again. 😔
Arg never underestimate the cunning of a pirate or an 39 inch alien animatronic for that matter a
wat fuck is that?
I know a lot of friends (mostly girls) that like stitch
I've been there and it was an amazing attraction both sad and mad that they shut this down do me a favor Disney and open this ride back up you heard me Disney right now there will be no excuses no nose now I'm so sorry that I had to get that out that way but I had to say that cuz my feelings are clear😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The Disney world has 6000 animatronics    The night guard:➡️➡️💻⬅️⬅️

I actually visited the attraction with my family when I was 11,  Personally I thought it was amazing how real they made it look and the detail they put into it, let alone the amazingly smooth movements of the animatronics
Stitch: I always come back *next year* stitch: I'm back once again

BRO, FNATI IN THE REAL LIFE
Everyone stop saying my name
What does he mean by when he said stitch was most complex animatronic in the world”?
Did burn or something or like that like decomposed or just just like they just burn it or burn the whole entire place down I don’t know but he was bad
Bro is spring trap
To be honest, it was pretty decent. It was actually kind of funny.
OK, what’s the story about Disneyland
Bro we wanted him gone and then Disney did what we wanted, THEN WE SAY DISNEY IS AT FAULT WTF
This used to be my fav as a kid
Am going to source them because I love stitch 😢😢😢😢😢😢
pov:stich in fnaf be like
They had to redo something on him there’s nothing wrong with him that’s his endoskeleton and they should put the ride back
Don't tern on that on it's scary 😰
😅😅😅😅😅😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😮  I am so 😂 Oh my god that was Quinn.
"i am gonna tell you why this terrifying thing exists"  "is it because he is a damn animatronic"  me:*watches till the end of the short*  also me:"oh"
No you can't say that you can edit in my whole room is Stitch themed and don't talk about Stitch
Stitch is my favourite charter
Har har harhar 	har 	harhar har Har har
Ono
“Withered stitch” game:Fnad
why does he look like springtrap lol "Stitchtrap"
a fire broke out, that's why he looks like this
Is there any one Disney die so you can go there and play digits birthday because I can’t wait to try it on McNeary the only one in the trailer and only one old😳
Where is the child?
Really enjoyed that exhibit when I was a kid, it's a shame that the critics didn't enjoy it. Quite a unique experience, and certainly my favourite 4D exhibit.
"I always come back" ahh robot💀
I think I remember seeing this through Disney channel. Does anyone remember those live-action skits that used to play on the channel involving some person with a the first person camera breaking into some halls and it was related to Leo and Stitch?
Mfer will always come back 💀
Dang the night guard is suffering alone with over 6000+ animatronics
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🧟🧟🧟🧟🧟🧟🧟🧟🩸🩸🩸🦠🦠🦠💩💩💩🤬🙀🙀🙀🙀👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻🦿🦿🦿🦾🐉😅😮
You see stich i see FNAF
It was ass I went on it
Fun fact; this used to be Extra Terrorestrial, repurposed cause the original attraction scared little wuss kids. And somehow this is even scarier.
Someone should make a game about haunted animatronics…

Fnaf 3 😨😨😨

Bro, this is spring trap People who agree  👇
Hey if Disney wants to do anything for Halloween, that animatronic would be useful.
I remember seeing it as a little kid and I loved seeing Stitch. Seeing it again is weird I feel both happy and sad to see it again.
Phantom stitch
Stitchtrap, come on Disney, we want Five Nights at Mickey’s!
I love you  sich😭😭😥😢
Maybe the animatronic broke and got into some kind of accident like that dragón animatronic that shoot fire, so maybe thats why they closed it

Omg stitchtrap
FNaF1
Bruh be lookin like springtrap
FNATI looking ahh😭😭😭💀💀👅🦶🦶
Springstitch: I will stich you back together
That movement is very advanced for the time. Making a completely alien thing move like a human to the point it looks normal is the magic.  I never have understood why the strip animatronics that they cant reuse. Even if they are made out of silk lined with gold, its a waste of time not putting them on display, let alone creating metal demons for later. Maybe their fabric budget is that stingy?  People will always be fascinated with older animatronics, put them on display. No magic will escape showing them to adults and teenagers. You might even be recruiting future generation imagineers by doing so.
I remember actually intending that ride as a child. It’s a core memory cause I loved absolutely loved stitch as a kid. From what I can remember it wasn’t anything too crazy the stitch animatronic did look cool, and too me I thought it really was stitch, but at the big moment of his escape it’s just the lights going off and you getting sprayed with water I assume meant to be his spit, and the lights come back on and the pods broken up. So yeah I can see why this ride would be shut down considering it really was just getting sprayed with water for a animatronic dancing in a tube lol.
Wait till autumn see's this☠️
Dayum if there was 2900 animatronics in there nightgaurd would check cams every milisecond😅
Disney is so Evil
me when I heard the word "animatronic": 🐻🐰🐤🦊🍕
How come nobody like it 😭
Why does it look like a springlock suit?!

I actually remember going to that in the summer of 2016, I don't really remember it being bad
Five nights at stichs
phantom stitch
Phone guy: There's a animatronic that does get a bit quirky at night, but you have nothing to worry about it.., maybe...
Sitchtrap
“The animatronics can get a bit ~quirky~ at night”
Just beware “The animatronics do get a bit quirky at night”- Phone Guy

Un, hey, do me a favor. *banging* Maybe sometime, uh, you could check inside those suits in the back room? *banging* I'm gonna to try to hold out until someone checks. Maybe it wont be so bad. *bang bang* Uh, I-I-I-I always wondered what was in all those empty heads back there. *chime plays*. You know ...*deep moan* oh, no - *noises followed by a loud screech and static*
Stichtrap
fnaf???
Disney world is like making fnaf with animatronics like those
Five nights at disney😭😭
the security guard who worked back then must've had PTSD from FNAF when he heard of it
Been to this attraction, as a kid it wasnt that bad, remember liking it, but it wasnt anything crazy
Stichtrap
Nah they got my boy plush trap back there💀
That looks exactly like a fnaf design
5 Nights at Stitch 💀🙏
I remember I got real sick in this attraction because of a smell that came from the seats when he burped at one point
I think we can all agree that we don't want to spend any nights with that thing, let alone five.
I clicked this because I thought it was a fan made Springtrap
I remember this shit. You in a dark room and at the end bruh spit on everybody. Or someojust spit on me
Blud looks like springtrap
Five nights at Stitch confirmed?!
It’s like there can’t be another animatronic not related to fnaf with out fnaf fans finding a way to make it about fnaf
it was closed after the Bite of '23
Looking at it the other way, looks like the skull of Toy Story Aliens.
Imagine be the night shift security. 💀
Fnaf all over again😂
Bro is stitch trap
Stitches endo looks like a fanf endo
I have a stitch puppet
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮t
Whaaat?? They scrapped it?? I liked it! Wasn’t able to get the smell out of my nose for a week but I liked it!
The Stitch of 87 💀
For those who never heard and for those who wanna share it  HERE IS THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Here’s a quick test: Have you ever lied, stolen, or used God’s name in vain? Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” If you have done these things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart, and the Bible warns that one day God will punish you in a terrible place called Hell. But God is not willing that any should perish. Sinners broke God’s Law and Jesus paid their fine. This means that God can legally dismiss their case: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Then Jesus rose from the dead, defeating death. Today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will give you eternal life as a free gift. Then read the Bible daily and obey it. God will never fail you
Stitchtrap
The first picture made me think it was an animatronic easter egg from fnaf no cap fr
😱😱🖕🤬😡☠️👎
Bro became springtrap
WERE GETTING SPRINGLOCKED WITH THIS ONE 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥💯
Mf Look Like some baby got inside the šuti got springlocked
I never realized there would be a Stitchtrap attraction
They could use that Animatronic for a different ride (maybe make it as some villains evil minion or something, kids won’t realised that Creepy Animatronic is actually Stitch right?)
FNAF fangame creators rushing to their desks rn
Withered Stitch 💀
Its Withered Stitch
I loved that attraction I did it over and over.
Yeah but whyd they rip it apart
5 nights at Stitchies
Springtrap that u?
I loved it
He looks like a fnaf character
Thats Springtrap
Схожий на спрінгтрапа
It’s because the ohio penis tickler bandit came when everything went dark that’s why you feel stuff touching you on the ride
Real Disney is Five Nights at Freddy's where they originated literally
“The animatronics do get a liltle bit quirky at night…”
Stitch trap
why bro look like springtrap💀
Its springtrap bro
I personally always thought this ride was pretty fun, it's sad to see stitch become withered stitch.
Bro is *Sticht Trap*☠
YouTube knew what they were doing when recommending me this video after watching all of those FNAF videos
"The animatronics get a bit quirky at night"
"I always come back"
Stitchtrap
thats not springtrap, thats stitchtrap it even got a endoskeleton💀
They copied  me im springtrap!!
I thought the ride was super scary as a kid XD
I rode it and it was ACTUAL HELL!! It absolutely terrified me as a kid!
Springstitch/stitchtrap😭
He is my favorite character
Springtrap???
I was an actor in in five nights at Freddy's
Nah that's Freddy Fazbear
“It’s only Springtrap if there’s a dead cereal killer inside” - poopeater23 (yes I said cereal on purpose)
i hope disney didn't put a dead child in there like william afton in fnaf 💀💀💀
Okay, but that little animatronic moved like a living thing and that's both amazing and horrifying in the best way, they should have relocated this guy somewhere else instead of letting him rot like a FNAF character
Five nights at Disney
I always come back
SHOULD have been there 😪 😕 😔 and then
stich wont go visit guatemala again
I'm the world's biggest fan of stitch I'm not jokeing😋😋😋😋
It's not that Stitch's Great Escape was bad... it just replaced one of Disney's greatest attractions and it paled in comparison
I dunno why Security guy was so pro when having 1600 animatronics every night... Wish him a raise tbh..
Disney, I think you pissed off the animatronics which is a great time to considered to search for security guards replacement if sheits gona wrong
"Five nights At stitches! Is this where you wanna be? I just don't get it!!"
POV he got spring locked
Itz not terrifying
Five Nights at Disney's
This attraction scared the shit outta me when I was little

Nah bro, you cant make Spring-stich 😭😭😭
Disney really said “Stichtrap”
5 nights at Stitches💀
Ignore people’s opinions sometimes, and do what you like.
I swear Disney needs to make an official FNaF themed horror game and attarction 💀
We need a fan FNAF lookalike game of this history
Stitchtrap💀
I rlly want them to bring this ride back, just in a much more tolerable ride. The reason it was closed bc the ride had a lot of bad smells (on purpose), and the lapbars would move rapidly as if stich was on you. The ride was just really uncomfortable hints its closing. But i would've loved to see this animatronic and tehy should bring him back!
I WENT ON THAT!!! It was really fun!
FNAF in real life
nah bro we got phantom stitch
I loved it even when he snotted me. Stitch rules, fuck those haters lol
Stitchtrap or Stitchwraith? 🧐
They actually took the Alien experience and ripped it away in the most half assed manner because "it was too scary" and then threw this into existence. That animatronic is hella impressive but stitch deserved better and so did the alien.
Don't worry guys it's just a springlock suit
bro thinks he's springtrap
What they do to springtrap.😭
😱😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😰😰😰😮‍💨😮‍💨😥😥😱😱😱😱

The night guard 💀
I rode that ride. I remembered it scaring the shit outta me cuz of the raining gunk and the dark and loud noises (though I tend to be scareed of a lot of that as a kid). In retrospect, it didnt feel like a very good attraction.
They couldn't just put all their animatronics into a hall for other veiws. It looked like such a good character 😢
Gah damn mabye the withered animatronics werent so unrealistic
WHY I LOVE STITCH HOW COULD THEY😢😭🥺😫?!

*_~ It was a really fun attraction tho', the only thing I was annoyed by were the kids screaming every 5 seconds._*
Ok but that stitch animatronic actually looked really cool when it was functioning.
Bro really came back💀
Reminds me of "Five Nights at Freddy's."😂 Especially because of the creepy animatronic. 🥶 Very much like a "FNaF" type of situation🧟‍♂️☠️
Bro I remember this attraction and the part where the lights go off and something touches you cheek,and then stitch is gone I hated that part
FIVE NIGHTS AT STITCHES 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀  👇

Stitchtrap ‼️‼️‼️
Bro Fnaf 2.0 💀
why did this randomly summon the fnaf fandom
The stitches do get a bit quirky at night
NAH BRO ALWAYS COMES BACK 💀
I actually knew a person who went to this attraction when it was open, I’m a little sad that I’ll never get to experience this ride for myself but hey, it was never meant to be I suppose.
I remember going there when I was little and for some reason being so scared and scream so much time cuz the lights were off and stitch was just spitting water everywhere thinking I was gonna get eaten despite holding my mom and brothers hand during the ride lol.
Dunno if this is /whoosh moment but pretty sure the picture is from a game-
Withered Stich
Blud really said “imma be springtrap”
My cats name stitch
Stitch trap 💀
I remember asking if I could go do the stitch ride and she said no it’s not working and the next two times I whent I’d be disappointed it was broken again. Wasn’t till years later I found out online it was never gunna open lol. No one clarified that to me.
Stitchtrap
Man I’m glad I got to experience it back in 2015, sad to see it gone as Lilo & Stitch were a part of my childhood but I can see how some people were bored as when I dragged some of my family onto it with me they were bored but glad I enjoyed it
I remember this attraction, it always scared me as a kid, so sad to see it wither away. I remember being in Florida and going to Disney world every 5 years. It was tradition.
How
I did not want to watch this before bed
Five night at disney's
So springtrap looking all green and creepy like that is realistically accurate
I went to this ride before when I was five
I remember going to disney and going to that

Shut up, shut up, shut up you’re telling me that they’re getting rid of stitch for no reason like I love you have a stitch plushy. How could you say that?
Someone needs to make five nights at stitches
I actually went on this ride with my grandma and aunt I was like five at the time, and I remember being terrified and having the sound of stitch run behind you and then sprayed a terrible smell in my mouth and at the end, he would enter the Disney castle and terrorize someone in there
Stitchtrap
People really took suggestions from a person named ‘cheesecake’

I hope everyone reading this finds the Lord God almighty and accepts that he came down from heaven, lived a perfect life, died for our sins and 3 days later rose from the dead. If you believe that, declare that Jesus is Lord and repent for your sins then you can go to heaven!! A place with no sin and sadness a perfect place! “May the Lord bless you and keep you make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you the Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.” Numbers 6:24-26 God bless and I hope to see you in heaven!!
Nah what’s next a purple guy murdering kids there💀💀💀

‘5 nights at stitch’
Stichtrap bro someone got springlocked that’s why they had to close the attraction
Dang, I wondered why I didn't see it when I went to Disney World a couple weeks ago. The last time I was 8 years ago and I was kinda looking forward to seeing it again.
Stitchtrap
Oh hey there spring trapped stich.
Why does this mf look like springtrap stitch edition😂
Hello, hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay? Uh, let's see, first there's an introductory greeting from the company that I'm supposed to read. Uh, it's kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, "Welcome to Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced". Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there's really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I'd probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay. So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they're left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh... Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of '87. Yeah. I-It's amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know? Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won't recognize you as a person. They'll pr- they'll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that's against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, they'll probably try to... forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn't be so bad if the suits themselves weren't filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort... and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh. Y-Yeah, they don't tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I'll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power. Alright, good night.  Uhh, Hello? Hello? Uh, well, if you're hearing this and you made it to day two, uh, congrats! I-I won't talk quite as long this time since Freddy and his friends tend to become more active as the week progresses. Uhh, it might be a good idea to peek at those cameras while I talk just to make sure everyone's in their proper place. You know... Uh... Interestingly enough, Freddy himself doesn't come off stage very often. I heard he becomes a lot more active in the dark though, so, hey, I guess that's one more reason not to run out of power, right? I-I also want to emphasize the importance of using your door lights. There are blind spots in your camera views, and those blind spots happen to be right outside of your doors. So if-if you can't find something, or someone, on your cameras, be sure to check the door lights. Uh, you might only have a few seconds to react... Uh, not that you would be in any danger, of course. I'm not implying that. Also, check on the curtain in Pirate Cove from time to time. The character in there seems unique in that he becomes more active if the cameras remain off for long periods of time. I guess he doesn't like being watched. I don't know. Anyway, I'm sure you have everything under control! Uh, talk to you soon.  Hello, hello? Hey you're doing great! Most people don't last this long. I mean, you know, they usually move on to other things by now. I'm not implying that they died. Th-th-that's not what I meant. Uh, anyway I better not take up too much of your time. Things start getting real tonight. Uh... Hey, listen, I had an idea: if you happen to get caught and want to avoid getting stuffed into a Freddy suit, uhh, try playing dead! You know, go limp. Then there's a chance that, uh, maybe they'll think that you're an empty costume instead. Then again if they think you're an empty costume, they might try to... stuff a metal skeleton into you. I wonder how that would work. Yeah, never mind, scratch that. It's best just not to get caught. Um... Ok, I'll leave you to it. See you on the flip side!  Hello, hello? Hey! Hey, wow, day 4. I knew you could do it. Uh, hey, listen, I may not be around to send you a message tomorrow. It's-It's been a bad night here for me. Um, I-I'm kinda glad that I recorded my messages for you, uh, when I did. Uh, hey, do me a favor. Maybe, sometime, uh, you could check inside those suits in the back room? I'm gonna to try to hold out until someone checks. Maybe it won't be so bad. Uh, I-I-I-I always wondered what was in all those empty heads back there. You know... oh no... [dies]
springtrap fnaf
Noo stich🤕🥲😓😭😭😭 I hate all the people who said it's trash😓😭😭😭
That ride was so much fun I wish it didn’t close
I think I would think it was that big yellow Bunny from poppy playtime
IS THIS THE BITE OF 87???
still can’t stop remembering that song in the movie where I heard ‘take off your shirt boy I wanna see”
["I always come back..."]
Okay Disney, don’t be mad when it starts moving at night and shit. You did this.
Did stitch actualy move like he would move in the cartoon and not like a animatronic? Or was that just that one part
Imagine being a security guard at Disney world with 6000 animatronics 😂 i would literally keep a tazer with me at all cost
As someone who was a kid that went to this attraction I had nothing but pure joy and amazement on my face. Making Stitch one of my favorite characters
One step back one step back that is creepy😅
Wasn’t there an attraction there before stitch?
Tbh I just burped and it reminded me of Stitch’s nasty burp in the beginning of the ride
Stitchtrap?   Stitch springlock suit??
thats a perfect antagonist for five nights at stitches 3 💀💀💀
I went here once when I was like 6 and it scared the shit out of me when the lights went out 😂
Don’t go to That Or else you will die
He didn’t explain
Five night at stitch
Stitch trap
“Stitchtrap”
Went in 2019 and it was open
Bro got springlocked💀💀

Sping locks
That looks like sping trap
Withered Stitch 😭
Nah no way stitch got springlocked 😢😢😢😢
Five Nights at Stitches
Hey I liked it :( I remember going there:(
i love stich
Looks like Stitch almost looks like he turned into the Mangle
😮
Bro is becoming springstich
You could say stitch has a glitch
I remember that it was fun
" Five night with Stitch "☠
Springtrap wannabe
'William'
When I heard animatronic tge first thing I thought was
His annex
Probably shouldn’t have watched this at night💀
Bro became springtrap
😂😂😂😂

But I LOVE stitch😢
5 nights at Freddy's.
“Hello? Hello Hello?”
Disney bring stitch it back as I hate you
Wonder how long till someone makes a 5 nights at freddys fan game of this.
Springtrap
Stitchtrap
Spring trap + stich = springich
i remember this actually, and i suppose I was way too little to comprehend the whole plot? however one core memory i have is stitch going to eat something (i now now it was a chili dog) and someone SCREAMING and then he burped. so i naturally thought he deadass ate someone and that’s the one defining thing i remember from that ride
why do i suddenly think of stichtrap
I actually liked that ride. Sad to see it go away.  I remember going to Disney World back in 2019 and see that the ride was closed. I wish they didn't close it.
Whitered Stitch.
Stitchtrap
I legit actually liked it and would try to ride it every chance I could every time I visited. I believe it was my first visit when Stitch spat on me during his escape. It's a shame that something so complex was scrapped.
Walt Afton or William Disney?
This is what stitch looks like
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
That’s so scary I do you never wanna see that picture ever ever ever again
That ain’t an animatronic that’s a cartonic 💀
Stitchtrap
Me being a stitch fan:
Imagine getting Spring trap on Stitch
NOOOO I LOVED THAT ONE STITCH WAS GREAT
Imagine this was what caused the bite of 83
nah thats stich trap
oh fuck, this is bringing back my trauma from this shit
Withered stitch
That thing looks like it belongs in 5 nights at Freddy's
I might have liked it they did all that work for assholes to just hate on it
Most animatronic's do get abandoned sometimes sometimes they are remade or just left broken
Damn he looks like spring trap
Nahhhh bro that’s just springtrap
❤😊
I got ptsd from that fukin thing
Ar ar ar ar ar ar ar freddie
Stitch trap
Stitch is my fav
Bro is withered
AYO STITCHTRAP
Bro thinks he is Springtrap 💀
Dum Dum Didlly Dum Dum~Foxy.
legit I was terrified of this ride
I actually remember going to this ride WAAAAAY back in 06 or 07. Now, I was young, and I loved lilo and stich, so I enjoyed it. I think the ride even broke at one point. I then went on splash mountain and it also broke right before the big drop.
Springstich😂
Is it me or when I look at the arms in the second picture it looks like spring locks
Stitchtrap
No way springtrap💀
I liked it they had him “jump” on the chairs and yell in your ears but it was just the seats moving around it was supposed to be a kind of 4d experience
I used to really like this attraction! It was so cool seeing Stitch and it was very impressive. Not the best attraction, but it was neat!
Idk I kinda liked it,my brother said he felt something breathing on his neck when the lights went out
Five Nights at Stich's
*_We’re waiting every night to finally roam and invite..._*
Damn, too bad I didn’t get the chance to experience 9 inches of stitch
Omg it’s FNAF 109281,019 😱😱
😮
Springtrap*
It's Stitchtrap!
Make that a nighttime horror attraction an it souls sell tickets out almost instantly
Stitch trap💀💀💀
Guys, is that freddy fazbear? ar ar ar ar
I think it would be nice if they had the attraction back❤😊
Stichtrap!
Can I have it

Five nights at freddy's
Why he kinda looking like Bonnie all the sudden lol
bro got the withered treatment
I actually got to check this attraction out while it was operating, it wasn’t that bad, it was a fun little show.
Bro that just "StitchTrap"
The man behind the slaughter
He looks like springtrap
Fnaf 100
I always come back 💀
I remember this ride too. So, that’s what happened to the animatronic. Unfortunate.
When I was a kid I remember seeing this stitch ride/attraction. He spits water at you but it freaked me out. He looked real as all hell. I was never a fan of animatronics, especially chucky Cheeses. So I'll never be a security guard at FNAF.
Five Nights At Old Disney Be Like:
He look like spring trap
Bro thinks he's springtrap💀💀
I loved this ride as a kid. I would Go thought it so many times. I loved stitch so much and screamed with him when he spat on people(I might have spit on people too) 😂😂😂
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I remember this attraction, I got slimed
I remember going into the experience not knowing what to expect as a kid, only to be "clever" and pull my legs up when the air compressors pulsed (Stitch running between people's seats) or move to the side when the water gun was shot (Stitch spitting on the guests).  I never knew it was a rebuild of the original "alien encounter" and thought the black out part of it was the best part of it. It was surreal for sure, though I guess if it was still around, it wouldn't have the same experience as other rides would. Shame to know it's been called the worst, but I guess Disney will always find a way to build off of failures for something bigger in the future (maybe).
He looks like one of the phantom animatronics from FNAF 3
Har har harhar
Smash
Lila didnt follow Mohana, Stich got left behind
Stitchtrap
ITS STITCHTRAP
I remember going to stitches great escape as a kid and, it was mid.
Fnaf fans hearing the word: animatronic
......
Epic Mickey if Disney didn’t hold back
Me: … Everyone looking at it: AHHHH
It was a good ride, but people didn't like it because it took over alien encounter
actually disney said there bringing it back
I love that so many peoples’ first thoughts on seeing the thumbnail was FNAF.
All animatronics have one fate...
Why doesn't Fnaf look like this?
I went on this ride when I was a little kid and still remember how bad it scared the shit out of me.
StitchTrap is now a thing
👇People who dont know who Stitch is.
Oh god it’s StitchTrap
Blud thinks he springtrap
I Miss that ride may it rest in peace
Bro took “spring trap” to another level
Five nights at stitches

Cursed you cars you no no this is not look like that cursue you made it the stinking I'm calling the cops on you😢😢😢😢
Stitch didn’t escape the scrapper
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤯😭😭😭 sad🥲
First room is still sort of intact as of last year so I figure most of the decoration for the ride is intact and the animatronics are in storage, I wish they’d bring the attraction back or make stitch some other attraction, such a popular character that they refuse to use for anything other than merchandise.
"The bite of 87 yea..."
i personally liked stitch's great escape :< that and also the laugh floor
Stitch has not been taking his meds
Withered Stitch
Disney trying to ride the fnaf popularity wave but they just forgot the children💀                                     Or did they
The colouration of him makes me think one thing and one thing only: Stitchtrap
springtrap
Spring stitch 💀💀
I love that attraction 😭
Bro I liked it tho

FIVE NIGHT FREDDY?!
My mom told me about this ride went she went to Disney World when she was young and how my aunt my in tears because of the effects on the ride 😂
O my it's fnaf
Stitch was also a low-budget movie but still got successful .
Why does stitch look like spring trap from five nights at Freddy’s?😂😂
What have they done to you Stitch why would they do this in the first place? I see some people saying something Fnaf-related because they think that the abandoned Stitch robot reminds some people of Fnaf. Stitch is way better than Fnaf because while Lilo And Stitch is about the meaning of family or ohana and why is important Fnaf is dark and is about a guy building robots and turning innocent children into robots. Fnaf is alright but Lilo and Stitch is better
I actually got to see this a few years ago
Fnaf be like  I always come back  And He dead
Bro turned into Stitchtrap 💀
Stitchtrap
The people who did bad reviews it was your fault
I remember that ride.
guys is that glich trap

"the animatronics do twerk at night"
Hell naw they done turned Springtrap into a Disney animatronic
Tbh stitch looks like stitch trap
At the start he looked like plus trap 😂😂
Dude Disney needs to do a horror attraction of old exhibits and animatronics

He looks like that in 3:00am

It would be kinda cool if they gave it to the FNAF cast and they can remodel it a little and they can add it into the movie as a toy or something.

Is that bite of 2010
i remember i was in that exact ride. it was fuckin nuts for me i was scared shitless and it got so bad that i told my mom i wanted to leave. i remember that the animatronic would make a spitting motion and then eater would fly out AND THE WATER GOT ONTO ME AND MY LITTLE BRAIN THOUGHT IT WAS SPIT LOL
Me after I saw that: is that springtrap?
This is Phantom Stitch
Man that’s sad I want to see what it was like there man I love lilo and stitch!!
This ride fucking TRAUMATIZED ME!!! From my child perception I was strapped down in a chamber and gassed. Shit smelled horrible and I could almost never go on another movie ride again without having a panic attack everytime even the SLIGHTEST thing came alone that made me think a horrible smell was coming.   Gas chambering me was Stitch’s greatest mistake…I lay a Silent Hill CURSE on that ride that’s CLEARLY taken it’s toll 🤣 Stitch ruined my entire day and arguably my entire life…lol
That thing exactly looks like spring-trap or should I say Stitch trap😅
Pov:autumn monique comes 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Helllooooo everbodddyyyy. My name is Markiplier and welcome to Five Nights at Disney.
this ride traumatized me as a kid ngl i was crying the whole time while stitch was yelling and spitting at us. they really did the movie dirty with this so called ‘ride’
He sits like golden freddy
Is this the new animatronic from FNAF/j
The animatronics to get a bit quirky at night 😰😱😳
Stich went to a beutiful koala to a raw thing that looks like spring trap
I used to love this attraction, stitch was actually a rebranding the attraction was originally an alien horror experience that heavily featured the principal from ferris beaulers day off.

Man! Abandoned discovery island 3.0 looks great!
This ride was the replacement for Alien encounter
I wonder if someone put the suit on to protect themselves from children
Glad to know I got to experience this attraction not once but twice in my childhood. My first trip to Disney is still hands down one of the most fondest trips I hold in my memory.
😭 he does not deserve it
Me rn :crying and squealing:
The guy in the suit started sweating and became spring trap/ stitch trap
I showed my cousin this cuz she loved stitch and she was horrified💀😂
I love stitch, so you better not make fun of it. I’m gonna be on my stitch beanbag chair right now.😡😡😡😡
Well, guess what you’ll never stop me from loving stitch😡
I went on this when I was younger, and I remember screaming my lungs out.
P
The next springlock failure
Hmmm
Fake
"Stitchtrap"
Stitch???????
I remember going to this attraction when it was still available in Disney World. The experience was quite fun, the ride did have one annoying issue; the seats had these electronic seatbelt bars that would sometimes glitch and push down on the customer’s shoulders making the seats uncomfortable. If Disney had made the seatbelts manual, it might have been a better experience.
Autumn Monique’s reaction  👁️👄👁️
Springtrap      Bottom text
Five nights at freddy's in real life
No
Fun fact: before the stitch attraction was open in it's place was this horror attraction where you were in a Alien Ridley Scott inspired space ship and there was a robot who tried to demonstrate a teleporting device by using some weird cute creature as a test subject but when the robot trys to teleport the creature something goes wrong and the creature melts and later on you witness this giant Xenomorph like Alien and it kills a bunch of people it honestly looked like a pretty cool attraction
It’s seems okay to me

Yyyyaeh I’m just gonna cancel my trip to Disney would because they’re is no way I’m gonna see that fukcin scary thing never 👎 in my life 👍
Stitchtrap💀
Stitch's Great escape
Fun fact: The ride was fine, the problem was that it replaced “Extraterrestrial Alien Encounter” which was beloved because of its departure from the cutesy Disney esthetic, it was NOT for kids, they had to put many warnings infront of the ride, after parent backlash, Disney thought it was too scary and turned it into Stitches Great Escape.
Not Stitch 😢
Just cause its the endo dosen't mean its all destroyed buddy
what is this five nights at Freddy's?
Yeah, I went to Disney land a couple of years ago, and it was closed, I was so sad!

Withered stich
Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends.  And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should.  And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.  My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours, and then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest - for you, and for those you have carried in your arms.  This ends for all of us.  End communication.
I remember loving stitche's great escape
😮
I don’t know what’s worse this stitch ride or the rocket rods destroying the people mover track.
Nah, Superstar Limo is the worst Disney attraction ever
👹👹👹
How he is still cute tho-
Liar
I want it Back😢
For some random context:  This area was originally host to “extra-terrorestrial alien encounter” which was basically a pitch black sensory horror experience. Its a circular room with a big alien animatronic in a cage in the center and when the monster “broke out” the lights would go out. Then the chairs you sit in would play audio and shake around and stuff to simulate the alien crawling around the room on top of your chair. It was closed because it was too scary or something so they opened this, which was identical in premise but more comedy instead of horror. People still hated it, so it shut down. The theaters are now just backrooms used for storage and all the robots (the stitch one and a few more in the queue line) were all presumably scrapped for parts.  Or they could still be rotting away in there. Who knows.
Me:sneaks in and makes a better stitch when im done imma open it

tip for getting on this ride: don't sit in the seats thats the closest and bring a camera that has a flash

stitch couldn’t get “stitched back up
God dayum why does Stitch looks like what did they do to him??
They might use this animatronic for the live action Lilo and stitch that might be releasing soon, It would be in good use to the animatronic since it’s the same character also they could redesign it or even fix it more to make it durable for movie standers on what their aiming for. Idk just some thoughts comment if u aggree or have other suggestions👇😃
I went when I was like 7 it was very  Cool and fun
Am I the only one who thinks it looks high af

Most normal animatronic in fnaf
Okayyyyyy.............       I WILL SUE DISNEY EVEN THOUGH STITCH FOR ME ANNOYING SO DISNEY, WHY HUH?! HUH?! HUH?!
Stich trap
Can ya get it to work again?
I wish I could have experienced the attraction that was replaced with Stitch’s Great Escape, I’ve heard stories about how utterly creepy and terrifying it was.
Fun fact: this was kinda made for a replacement of another ride with the same story. But the original ride was too scary for younger kids which Disney took place and decided to change it with there newest character who was stitch. But this failed and led to this. Watch the video called “the scariest Disney rides” by fast pass facts to see what the original ride was.
Last I visited the signs and sound that used to play during the people mover were completely removed. This is a year old video and I probably missed something but it’s sad…
Okay, now I will go cry in a corner for a while, because Stitch is my favorite Disney character
Looks similar to Audrey two. Eeeeek😮
😮😢🎉tf😂gfjdg👋😐☺️😊🥲😊🥴🤔😶🙄😒😟😮😲😇👿😷😇🌝🌚☠️☠️🙀😽🎉🙈✨✨🤎💚
Cool
The ride was pretty cool. Went on it a couple times when I was younger as stitch was and still is my favorite disney character. I was sad to hear it was removed they year the decided to remove it
High tech robots I NEEDA MICORAVE BOT 😂😂😂

Great escape was a major flop it was eventually called the worst attraction that Disney had ever made in 2016 the company said that the attraction would enter a seasonal operation and be temporarily closed but then these photos leaked online making us think that this attraction might be gone for good this is what stitch looks like in Disney 😱
WAY NOW WAY I LOVE STITCH
Excuse me, I love stitch, and that animal Tronic was the best
Not stitch😭😭😭💔💔💔
Bro became Springtrap
So interesting

Stitch no why can’t I see your color you need to be the way you are when I’m watching the show of you but why do you look like this you don’t look like this stitch is not a animatronic
I went on that when I was 5 and it was fun

I don't think that's real because I love Stitch and that's why
Me: why cant we use spring trap instead of this stich fix him?  Spring trap: Am I a joke to you?

Why are you so mean that? He does not look like that?

The attraction would enter a seasonal operation and be temporarily

It had a weird smell when I entered it still don't know what smell it was to this day
I went on that ride when I was like 3 or 4 and it scared me to death. Of course I started crying and never really like Disney after that, only went like 2 more times

Springtrap got merged with stitch
The attraction before that was called alien encounter originally the alien that was the xenomorph from the alien franchise but they made there own alien but the xenomorph was still used in the great movie ride but the ride shut down and became Micky and Minnie's runaway railway

I went on this ride when I was little, like four. I was so blown away by the sound affects, the lighting, and how Stitch would move whenever the lights turned off. It's sad that it closed, bc I hoped to go on it again one day.....I guess not:(
Goofy a. Stitch if he never toke a shower and did not care about life

hiii
Fnaf Disney be like
A Springlock suit is a special animatronic that can be used as both an animatronic and suit. In order to turn the animatronic into "suit mode", you will require a special crank which pushes the endoskeleton and mechanical gears to the sides of the suit, making just enough space to wedge a person inside. The two most notable springlock suits are Spring Bonnie and Fredbear.  The suits contain a metal endoskeleton which has a line from the head to the groin and legs. Once it has been wound up using a metal crank, the suit splits vertically in half, allowing a person to wedge themselves inside and wear it. If the gears of the suit get damaged or damp, the endoskeleton snaps back together, crushing the person inside instantly.
I tought i hear is stich face💀
Fanf 3 be like
Disney building themselfs a fnaf lore
Spring trap is that you?
I Remember going on this ride when I was really little and tbh I think I was pretty traumatized by it because it almost tricked your brain into thinking all these different things were happening.
Mom can we have  some Fnaf   We have Fnaf at home  Fnaf at home
Dude this traumatized me like 6 years ago.

Bruh, Five nights at Stiche's💀
I remember riding this when I was like 5 and freaking cried my eyes out cause I was scared
I love stitch but now lm sad
Aaaaa

why is this scarier than a monster that is stuck inside a suit and killed kids in 1900s that went to hell
Nooooooooooooooooo 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Not trow 🖕😠👎
When I was a kid I thought it was so funny for some reason when he burped! Though I am actually sad because there is not other lilo and Stitch ride!
Stitch:uh.. uh what are you gonna do?  Me:*ripping and destroying him*
omg????? stich is a robot
Bro reminds me of spring trap but if there was no double package(also known as dead body inside)
What the f***
Dude I love Stich while y’all gotta rune like dam🥺 I wanted to try it

I actually been to this ride as a little kid and let me tell you worse thing I have ever been to in one seen stitch burps and they use garlic and everyone nearly threw up
I've been there, I can conform it didn't like it. You would get shot With water, but it smelled really REALLY bad, I doubt it was even water.
stitch is my fav caracter
He looks like friggin Springtrap.
Stitch is my favourite Disney character
This was one of my favorite rides lmao
That moment when you went there when you were younger.....
😱 bro dat scary
“I always come back”  And he did.
"Springtrap Stitch"
I've been there, the alarms go off after u see him break the glass and all u do is walk out after that, it wasn't to good :(
Spring trap in ohio
I guess stitch went to hang out with FNAF
I think Stitch might need a dentist for 2022..

I have flashbacks to Freddy Fazbear pizzeria simulator
It is gone for good because it was too scary for kids. Monday I got stuck on the people mover and they had to evacuate and I had to walk through the shell of stitch’s great escape..it was very creepy
I’m sad to hear that 😞
AAAAAAA
Omg I went on it as a kid and I was so scared
Okay let me tell you because Stitch is evil and sometimes he's nice and that's why drama make him and that's why he's afraid so yeah so so maybe drama making creepy all serious well Stitch is kind of normal because we will Mom Stitch don't know about it
I went to that attraction in the beginning of 2016
What happened to him
Na I remember going on that as a kid and the star wars one they were both amazing and the stitch is more of a show than a ride

Flip you
I’m so sad I have been on that attraction before it was one of my favorites!!!! Now it’s a monsters inc ride or something.
I remembered back in 2014 (the year I first visited USA) when we go to Magic Kingdom and IMO this ride wasn’t that bad, I mean, it was funny and all that. So I’ll say that thank god that I had the chance before it was gone
If I were there o would like the ride cuz I love stitch ❤

Bruh why does this remind me of wet koalas which is 1 of my fears
DISNEY BETTER FIX STITCH👺👺
That was my fave thing to see stitch and there was a rollercoaster I believe
i—
Damnnn I would’ve recycled it for yoda

I love Stitch why did they shut it down
That ride scared me
Yo what the hell
The movie is cooler than the zombie
He look so scary
My god he looks creepy that he gave me nightmares
I literally freaking love stitch so much until I saw this😳
They did not rush him that attraction used to be alien encounter
"This is what stitch looks like in Disney World." My heart: He's ruined Pirates of the Caribbean for me, he's ruined Disney Land, please Stich is my favorite character, I cannot bear to watch! My head: But the music...it provides me ✨curiosity✨
Noooo stichhhh

I was in this attraction when it was still running, and I’ve carried a trauma from it since then 💀
You lying

I was in that event. It was cool
Me: he’s not a monster he’s beautiful  People: * literally scared of this stitch

I remember going to this ride when i was five and was really scared of the attraction
I went on that ride when I was younger and it got shut down cause it was to scary for young kids I literally cried it was the worst ride ever
Why dose stitch look like five night at Freddy's
It's still an awesome looking animatronic
I don’t know if I commented on this all ready but I was 6 yrs old and I was terrified but lucky for me I had my light up sneakers
Begshshsgsgs☝🏼😡

Why is it bad? That's how robots are made with first a base, then a code, THEN the paint
Is that not there anymore? I was terrified of that
Let me fix this thing....

Omg- when I was maybe 3 or 4 my parents took me to Disney world and I saw that stitch BEFORE it was shut down and I hated it… it shot me with water and it was very dark (I was scared of the dark). I do agree that it’s the worst

Five nights at Freddysssss Is this where you wanna beeee
What is that thing
Oh my God that is Hora fing!!!😱
They changed it. It used to be Alien Encounter.
It is so cool
Experiment 626
I love scary items
Disney: No, No!!
you forgot about E.T. Alien encounter of extra terrorestial alien encounter, it was this before it existed. instead of stitch it’s based off alien
Thats straight out of fnaf lol
My man looking like a apringlock suit
Shhhhhhhh
😭
This I only got to ride once I tried to go on it again but sadly it was gone I wish that Disney would make a different stitch ride and maybe put it in fantasy land instead of getting rid of alien encounter cause that’s where most hate comes from when Disney replaced it with dpstitch I’m sure reviews would probably be way better
HE'S DEAD HELP HIM 😱
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Hello? Hello, hello? Uhh, I wanted to record a message for you... to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I’m... finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact, so... I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I’m here to tell you: there’s nothing to worry about. Uh, you’ll do fine! So... let’s just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?  Uh, let’s see. First, there’s an introductory greeting from the company that I’m supposed to read. Eh, it’s kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, 'Welcome to Stitch’s Great Escape; a magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. The Walt Disney Company is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovery of damage or if death has occurred, a missing person’s report will be filed within ninety days or as soon as property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached and the carpets have been replaced.' Blah, blah, blah...  Now that might sound bad, I know. But there’s really nothing to worry about.  Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No! If I were forced to sing... those same stupid songs for twenty years, and I never got a bath? I’d probably be a bit irritable at night too. So remember: these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children, and you need to show them a little respect. Right? Okay.  So just be aware: the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uhh, they’re left in some kind of "free-roaming mode" at night. Uhh... something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uhh... they used to be allowed to walk around during the day, too, but then there was the Bite of '87. Yeah... I-It’s amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?  Now concerning your safety: the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uhh, if they happen to see you after hours, probably won’t recognize you as a person. Th-They’ll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now, since that’s against the rules here at Stitch’s Great Escape, they’ll probably try to... forcefully stuff you inside a Stitch suit. Um, now that wouldn’t be so bad if the suits themselves weren’t filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So you can imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort... and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh. ...Y-Yeah, they don’t tell you these things when you sign up...  But hey! First day should be a breeze; I’ll chat with you tomorrow. Uhh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power.  Alright. Goodnight."
I'm  can't tell my sister😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😰
Wait, I went to that in 2016! I think that was a few months before it closed too..
Why did I love him he's the best character in Disney ever fine

I remember when my little brother and mom went to Disney for a baton performance. When he got back, he went on and on about this show and how much he loved it. When I finally got to go years later, they had closed it for good and we all were super upset.

In my opinion they should make more stitch rides
It was after the alien acoter
NOOOOOOOO STICH
Imagine that stitch place became five nights at stitch
My favourite Disney character 😕😕🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😦😦🥺
It just a stone and stone and that just a movie
It was alien encounter  first. But they changed it. It was scarier and cooler than stitch.
Now it is the monsters inc laugh floor
I remember I got to ride it while it was still running. It was based on the scene in the movie where he escapes the ship. It was really cool really cause it was one of those lazer gun rides, you would hear him laugh and crawl around while trying to capture him. It was one of the first rides of it’s kind, it really did bad because it was a attraction ahead of its time
😐😐😐
It was fun
AHHHH!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😱😱😱😱
😱
nah the broken animatronic looks so much cuter
Oh my God she was one of my favorite characters who ever say it is a horrible wide is a Karen or maybe they get scared I don’t care what you’re great ride
ydhuwj😭
You had Disney world, don’t you?
😨?
Bfnd
It’s fake because I watch the movie tons of times and I know how stitch looks like it doesn’t look like that he has he has like a blue skin so that’s not how he looks like 😡
😢😨😰🤭😧😰
That’s creepy
The animatronic endo skeleton head looks like klombo from fortnite
That ride scared the shits out of me as a kid
Stitch is my favorite Disney character
Whoever said it sucks shut up
ZZZZ zzz zzz
I remember going to this attraction when I was little and I never wanted to go back there again because I was so scared when they had the lights turned off and have the sound of stitch and making it seem that he is roaming around. Also it was pitch black in there
But it was scary to me
I actually rember going there when i was really young
😱😰😨
Is that purpple guy? OMG SPINGTRAP THE MAN BEHIND THE SLATER
😱😱
this is gone????
That or Disney is making a more complex animatronic who knows
I remember going to this when I was little lol but I actually never knew it closed
POV you know fnaf: Me:OMGG ITS STITCHTRAP OMGGGG

"Five nights at stitches"
Freddy : runs  Stich : I always come back
Stitch looks much better than THAT CREEPY Mickey mouse
Stitch
I went to this ride as a kid. Seeing stitch in this state low key gives me this vibe that I never felt before (not a good one)
I went on this ride once and it was an absolute nightmare
Wow
NOTYANL NPTWU😢😭
I love stech
Bruh i cried after riding that honestly that scared 7 year old me
What the
Lol FNAF
Okay... um No! They had Alian Encounter.... and it was too "Scary" and real buggy.... so it was repurposed with a new Stitch animatronic..... but since the attraction still relied heavily on total darkness. Many Guest and families gave it a try and with little ones they did not bother with the attraction again.
i went on that rideeee
Stitch is my favorito disney carácter so sad f ro me to hear this
This is why I hate lilo and stitch
Ah hell nah it's Withered Stitch
That is the creepiest thing  I've ever saw 😱😱😱 man
I saw stitch and started crying bcs I love stitch 😭
Another celebrity’s career ruined by meth and crack
Chuck E cheese was my worst nightmare but I got over is 2 years later.
When it was opened I was so scared every time we go on it. It was dark and loud and I thought I was gonna get shot by the big guns. I love Lilo and stitch and Stitch was one of my favorite characters but when it closed I was a little sad to see what actually happened to stitch and it broke my heart because the stitch animatronic was the only part of the ride that calmed me down.
😱😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😨😰😰😰🧐🧐
This ruined my loving of stitch
🤔
?

I remember going to that attraction stitch   would stand on ur shoulders I didn't think it was bad tho
“How wide does its mouth open”.” sir this is a kids ride and your a 50 year old with no children I’m going to have to ask you to leave”.
This ride was changed twice now. First it was the alien encounter (I believe) and then it was Stitch’s great escape. Sorry if I’m wrong1
Not good
I went on this when I was 6 and I fucking hated it. I'm glad that little blue shit is a rotting endoskeleton
This i why i my uferad of the dark
😑😑😑
Ayo is that looks like William afton
What do they have to cover for you to
I think this attraction still exists in Disney World. But not sure. Been 4 years since Ive been there and on that ride.
Making a cross
Is it me or the zombie stich looks cute
Me and my sibling got scared and it spit in my sibling's mouth when it was shooting out water I was like 4 at the time
I swear that stitch is freaking haunted.
That’s so sad, I remember this being one of my favorite attractions when I went there as a kid :(
LIE IT WAS THE BEST RIDE I HAVE EVER BEEN ON THEY BETTER NOT HAVE CLOSED IT DOWN IF THEY DID I WOULD NEVER GO AGAIN And they closed it down permanently on July 16 2020😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
"The animitronics get a bit clunky at times"
Lol     *S T I T C H T R A P*
One time I watched it and now I'm watching it a second time it's so scary good also
That's nasty that's nasty. Crazy crazy people
BUT IT SO CUTE AND SCARY WHY DID THEY HAVE TO DESTROY IT
The reason why he now looks like that is because when animatronics like that is because it stays there for a long time and starts rotting away, think of it like fnaf 2, the 4 main animatronics stayed there for at least a decade, and started rotting away from staying there for so long Bro I miss this ride so much
😪😤😱😭😢😥😓😰😨
I watched this yesterday
They’d gag😱😱
Dude that's creepy is creep
I love Stitch the would happen I've never going to Disney World so are you saying that when I go to Disneyland I'll Never See stitch on the ride please let me know when they'll come back with the right okay cuz I really want to see Stitch 2 PECO stitches Lilo & Stitch are one of my favorite Disney movies and my mom's never seen it so one day when we both go to Disney World I really want to see Stitch with her go on the Stitch ride okay let me know when they come back

Jeez, it straight-up became Springtrap

Wat did he do
People complain about anything. I thought it was awesome as a kid
YouTube recommendation at night:
How do you know all of this?
I was on this ride in in the weird thing is that in part of the ride stitch spits on you and when you go on the ride you teleport to a Disney mart
Ggrrrrrrrrrr I am Caleb . Exe
Why do people think Disney is haunted like it not
It’s kinda cute 🥺
William Afton: WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN!!!
Oh my god looks like an five nights Freddy s  version of stitch😟😨
They replaced the alien ride with this. 🤦🏾‍♂️

Please stop running stitch for me it's one of my favorite Christmas movies
My family and I were one of the last people to ride it before it closed in the spring of 2016
“You stand there in the dark while stitch eats a cheese dog and burps” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I can’t🤣🤣

Why he look like spring trap
There needs to be a game about this animatronic tbh.

I love these kind of mysterious Disney secrets
The Stitch animatronic was cute though!!!
Other people :uhh I'm scare creepy Fnaf players: that's normal
I have stitch in my hand a thrown him
I remember riding this and when we sat down with my parents there wasn’t enough room for my brother so he sat alone and the ride scared him and i felt soooo bad but the employee comforted him🥺
😭😭 I Love stich
Someone's going to get jump scares
Is not too late to get a five nights at Freddy's 😂😂😂😂
𝙎𝙩𝙞𝙩𝙘𝙝 😭😭😭😭

I went to Disney World like 9 years ago when this ride was still there, I went on it and it was one of the scariest things
Not my favorite Disney friend
dead ass i remember goin on that ride as a kid i got scared ash n left leave ealry when stitch started crawling on the ceiling n makin noises😭😭
Oh my God...
:( NOOOOOOOOOOO
I remember when my sister was visiting me  in Florida and we went to Disney it was me my sister and my dad we went to that ride.
Bro when i saw stitch i was: I hate stitch now
WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS! YOU TOLD US COUNTLESS TIMES!
I remember going into this attraction as a kid! It forever haunts me because I specifically remember screaming and vomiting while in it.
Fnaf X Disney
A lot of people remember going on this ride thingy including me, because it’s very recent and only a few years old 😔
NOT scary at all
The Stich looks cute though—
I RODE ON THIS it was bad.
Omg in my opinion Stich is adorable why would you get rid of him- (don’t think I’m weird
Just I'm think about fnaf🤔
Say 11111
Noooooooo my baby sitch I love himmm 😖😖😖😖🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Scary I'm scared if this animatronic come in my house I will kill him faster with the knife and run with my dad with my mom
😫😱😥
I know I’m not special so there’s nothing to do about it cause I’m just binging your videos BUT FOR THE THIRD TIME IM GOING TO FLORIDA TODAY AND I DON’T NEED THIS IN MY MIND FOR 18 HOURS
I loved stitch. Poor guy.
It moves so life-like , amazing
Bro why
stich looks lick it's in five nights at freddys
This looks like something straight out of five nights at Freddy's is this going to be in FNAF security breach DLC
idk but hes kinda cool if he is broken
Is that real? so scary😥😥
Me: im taking this old animatronic home Stitch: (Insert Robot Sounds) Me: Tada Stitch My Mom: Ahhhhhhh he looks so scary Me: Don't worry i will clean it
Stitch
😟😭😫😵
It wasn’t a bad ride .. I went on it a few times ….Less scary than the alien ride that was there before Stitch
Stich literally becomed springtrap
I went to this and it was realy scary
Stich nooooooooooo
I think you’re telling me about how the statue of stitch was made in Disneyland and the animatronics get a bit of Corky at night just like the Chuck E. Cheese animal Tronics
mmhh The animatroni
Fnaf alert
😰😰😰😨
Why is it was scary as no hair black why is looking 🤮🤮🤮
Wow it is now may 1st 2022 looking back at this incident makes me quiet sad the stitch franchise is sadly 😥 passing away.After the ride had been dismantled we have not heard or seen stitch since 😢 it was quiet sad to see the stitch attraction dismantled and lost in time forever.And after all this ride situation i am starting   To think that was the end for the franchise including the stitch we all know and love
Stich animatronic be like: turns to zombie fnaf animatronics be like: were more complex
😩😩
In my opinion that’s just Stitche’s bones in his body but idk
Zombie
FNAF  ?
But but... IT WAS CUTE!
Omg
I remember going to this when I was younger
Your videos are very terrific.
Well its an endoskeleton without the suit/Shell. I know this from FNAF Security Breach
YEA...🙄🤢
Nia is boring is sebum boarding the dad

In the what the hell is that dude 😱😱🧛👹👹🌋🔥🌡️🌰
I was so scared of Animatronic
OMG 😱 i went on that before!!!!
Hey I remember seeing that in its good condition
Five nights at Stich's
They could have (Disney) covered the parts making it more appealing and maybe attract riders.
When I heard this guy say 'animatronics' it reminded me so much about sister location and freddy Fazber .Comment down below if u watch them.!😊😌😉
I remember that when i was kid
1-/10
How dare they say stich’s ride was horrible stich is so cute
That was one of my favorite attractions! So sad to see it gone. 🥺
I love stitch you gust lieing
I love stitch you gust saying that bitch
I never went there, but it's probably like the Haunted Mansion ride now (that one freaked me out for months after I went on it).
No stitches my favorites

My mom's favorite Disney character:
I guess William Afton came back as stitch
i still think it’s cute…
I honestly liked this attraction. People who don't like it don't have to ride it nobody is forcing you too and everyone can have an opinion and people have a right to one, but don't go spread the negativity and ruin it for all those who liked it.
They closed down the attraction bc it was scary for little kids. The attraction had stitch a cute little alien so parents brought their children there thinking it was a cute ride for the children but in the end it only scared them that’s why it closed. My grandmother is a big fan of Disney that she goes every year and does the underground tours and everything so they talk to her bout this stuff a lot.
I remember going on that ride, that was the first time I went to Disney
Nah stitch is my favourite character don’t make me hate him
Why stitch
WHAT THE HECK
I rode that attraction as a little kid 😭
You’re mean
... "MICHAEL DONT LEAVE ME HERE"
I WENT ON THAT
Cute!!!!!!!!
That thing is going to be in my dreams tonight🤪😫
shouldn’t the company of Disney pay littering fines being that they just abandoned many places and leave they trash there
The stitch animatronic looked cool😶
Oh my god what is thet 😱😱😱
Still big fan of stitch
Damn. Stitch really does have a glitch.
Fiv nite fredi
I remember vividly on this ride screaming out “I DONT WANNA TELEPORT!” So embarrassing
I enjoyed the Stitch experience. Wouldn’t call it great, but it was fun.
Not srich he is my favorite movie
Bruh if those haters did not complain about stich then it would've been still open
Then Spring stitch is in fanf 3 be like: HELP AHHh PLZ FCUK HELP ME AHHHH/ the Nightguard: Wft
Disney : you people don't seem to like what I made let me scare your babies then 🙂
Well I guess you could say that he finally lived up to his name and ended up looking like he has stitches or that he needs stitches.  Am I right?
I hate humanity sometimes . Looking at the inner workings of an animatronic and being “oh that’s disturbing and is totally what we’ll see” no it’s not.
Stitchtrap
Someone should make a fnaf game about these abandoned disney animatronics, and it could be called "Disney's forgotten archives" or something
Stitch looks like an alien 👽👽
I actually enjoyed it when I experienced this attraction! I was a preteen then so maybe my judgment was different back then lol
Stitch stitch face equal slenders: D
I loved that attraction
😈😈😈
I remember this when little
He does not look like that
When he has the skin on hes cute but when he's a zombie he's freaky.
Quit lying
If the video was right. This is the only animatronic that moves continuesly. It doesnt stop for a second to do anothrr move
Stitchtrap
Wow 😯
Reported missing children, their bodies havent been found, and there has been some weird smell on them, that of a rotting corpse.
Stitched mouth so realistically when they made him as a robot anyways I have question why did that Center close
That's so funny. Cause that's my favorite attraction
If this thing had noise, it would sound like Circus Baby's jumscare noise whenever the microphone was on.
F Disney I love lilo and stitch
I WENT ON THAT RIDE They released a super weird spray that was supposed to imitate farts but my sister said it smelled like rotten pesto. I also remember everyone loving the animatronic, but I was too short to see it.
Well a lot might say "the ride sucks" but I wanna go on now
Actually one of the other mane reasons for the ride was originally it was a horror ride with aliens but it got a lot of hate since it was in magic kingdom and not Hollywood Studios so they closed that ride but when stich came out they changed it to stitches great escape.
😱
I remember going on a stitch ride that was just darkness and you could hear stitch going around burping and Lilo yelling at him, sometimes he would burp on you it was fun.. I dunno if it was this one.
Omg
Springtrap but better
Sad because i love stich
So who's making the fnaf fan game
Springstitch🤨😳😳
Bruh
Why are you making my child horrible?
Fnaf 3 be like
Then buzzlight year took its place
😱
That stich came from the underworld of fnaf and has come to haunt us 💀💀💀
He is cute
Fnaf book fans: stichwraith is that you?
You have apparently summoned the entire FNAF fan base to this video
Fnaf fans: write that down.. write that!
I never went on it, due to the lines being so long. I wish I did now. Stitch I had no idea Disney treated you so horribly. 😪 Disney you did him dirty.
I went on this is 2013
I was on that ride once i did not like it  not because it was Boring but it did not tell you it was a water park all the people got splashed with water and I can deal with some water but this water was burning peoples skin off it was like boiling hot water for two years and then dumping it on people do not ever go on this ride
I still love him no matter what<3
Roblox: I AM REMOVING STITCH FACE
Springszich
Noo not stitch his my fav
Can somebody make a fnaf game out of this
Man dude you must have been scare of everything when you were a kid I hope you have out grown that
I don't know what I was thinking, leaving my child behind..
I would say that suspicious Disney 🤔 huh
Poor stitch he was adorable!
😨😦
NOOOOOOO NOT STITCHHH
Nah get that fnaf shit away
What stitchface users look like:
The ride that replaced this became a huge role why this is hated. Alien Encounter is often known as one of Disney's scariest attraction, it was so scary that it only existed for 6 years. It was replaced by Stitch and they made it more friendly but it didn't deliver.
From zoescrazypets I like that seich
I love stitch
Omg
Isn't it amazing that the technology lets us bring fantasy characters to life?
Whatever. I still remember Lola's quote tho.. “Ohana means family. Family means nobody is left behind or forgotten” 🤪😂😂
0
But she is so cute 🥺🥺
Disney needs to stop letting the stuffed suites design these rides. If I need a PowerPoint presentation,  then great. Fun attractions...not so much.
Is this fnaf
😨😨😨😨😨😨 ok 😨😨😨😨😨😨😨 😢😢😢😭😭 I'm so scared 😭😭😭😭😭
I love lilo and stitch
This is actually quite sad they could have at least salvaged the stitch animatronic, it just seems like a waist.
Spring stitch
I was there and it was fun
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😱😱😱
Crazy i fucked wit that

Me: can we have sPringTrAP. Mom :  we ha- have stichtap at home. Burned Stich at home: i always come backs  Btw the staff tried destroying The animatronic at its last show By burning it during the escape part
Stich trap five nights at stich
bro that thing looks awesome I wish I could of see it
Crap I was there!
I remember this ride I thought it was good, from what I remember about my childhood going to Disney
I was really sad when I went to Disney one time and that attraction was gone. It was one of my favorite and it never got old for me.
Bruh that stitch animatronic look like it’s from a FNAF fan game
I remember when I was on the ride I was like 😲😐 throughout the hole ride
I remember that and I loved it
I like stech
I remember crying on this ride because it was so fucking scary
I love stitch BUT THAT IS NOY STITCH
I don't know why, but irl animatronics scare me so much more than the Fnaf ones do ;-;
Showed my sis creepy Stitch! Immediately took off running lol!
I remember when I was five that I went to Disney World for the first time. When I went I saw this ride and I thought how fun would that be but at the time the ride was so popular that the line went all the way to the beginning of the park. Do I never went on.
I love stitch
O no
I hate animatronics and I’m never going to Disney World again
they still have it
I whant it
I remember this ride and I had a lot of fun on it but after it closed it took me awhile to realize that I hadn't just made it up in my head
Springtrap?

Five nights Freddy’s
DO NOT BULLY STITCH
STITCH
I went about a month before it closed it was cool I was like 9 and obsessed with stitch but I really liked it

Looks like spring trap
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Withered stitch
I hate you!!😭😭😭
Springlock stitch
"Hey you asks for it"
Oh ic.
3 EYES!?
I remember going on this ride it’s was actually good :/
I went on that attraction in 2018, at one point he does burp an awful smell and “bounces” across the bars over everyone’s shoulders which causes it to press down on your shoulders which was quite painful
Five Nights at Freddy's vs Five nights at Disney World
fnaf veteran be like:  well shiii that my boah
But i like stitch but not now
I am so sad
NooOO my fav childhood film is abandon right know
Oh yeah..
I went on this ride when I was like 7, I absolutely loved it
😟
The bios there last why is closed why do get inside which is divided
This was my favorite ride ever
Stich was born from 2003 WE need answers how did he become a DESTROYED zombie robot in age 19  letter made in 2022 6:27pm  Friday April 1st.
The Witherd Animaltronic's from fnaf: *Welcome to The Club, Bro.*
I was there
Me:*Watches this*  Also me : *have an idea to send it to my friend that loves stich* Me SENDS IT TO HER AS FAST AS I CAN
😳
Stichtrap? Is that you?
I went on that rides about a decade ago it was fun to me it was like a 4D slow ride
I remember going to disney and seeing that when i was younger
Poor stich
Oh my God
Springstitch lol
NOOOO DON"T DO DIS TO MEEEE
I hope knowone goes in they mite die animatronics are kids that died they do want revenge
So low-key FNAF is real in Disney world
I love stitch and this will not change my mind
stitchtrap
Five nights at stitches
my boy stitch got decommissioned
Noooo
I went on that ride I am so scared now
Stich: reaching out for me Me:runs up arm slaps the unholy crap out of him then yeets 25 cents in his eyes then slaps him again Stich:blows up
"The animatronics do get a bit quirky at night."      -fnaf 1 phone guy
I would have loved it
Bro looks like springtrap
I would absolutely love to buy that because I never got the chance to ever see it and I’ve wanted to since I was a kid
🥹🥹🥹 I love stitch
It's better to watch fnaf Not for kids that are 1 to 9
You runan My life
Uwu
That actually looks really sad
Looks like fnaf
at first, the attraction was called extraTERRORestial encounter, based on the movie Alien. it was way too scary for even adults, so then it closed. Stitch’s Great Escape was it’s quick replacement. I went on stitch’s great escape when i was little when i was tall enough, i found it amusing but it wasn’t worth a long wait
I saw it
Stitch was cool I like this
Disney characters who fell off 😂
😱😱😱😱😱😱
i threw my phone across my room. it scared the stitch out of me
before you is an animatronic found in the back alley. we are unsure of its origins. it is youe job to complete the maintenance checklist before claiming it as salvage.
He looks like springtrap
I went to that I found it so fun
Ah such a, good memory
I hate it :(
They really couldn’t repurpose that animatronic for something else? Put it in a restaurant or store? Or add it to some other ride or show? What a waste.
stitch be looking like springtrap
😭😭😭😭😭😭NOOOOOO😭😭😭😭😭😭
The animatronics do get a little quirky at night bro,
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
He is just waiting until some kid die while looking around to start killing the night guards
I LOVED stitch’s great escape. I’m devastated that it closed :(
They need to make an FNAF animatronic lol
I have a stich and ITS EVL BECAUSE AT NIGHT IT ALLMOST KILLED ME WHIT THE FIRE LITER😨
Five nights at Freddy's
😨😨😨😨😨😱😱😱😱
omg i go dare befure
I have one word : “ Plushtrap”
*Fnaf flashbacks* . Jesus Loves You and Jesus is coming soon 🌺 Even if you feel unloved, remember that there will always be a Heavenly Father that will always love u ✨💖
I remember that one
This is FNAF in real life
Why is it so scary
I have been there
Omg William afton v:
OMG😱
I live in Florida and yeah this was a picture taken by the maintenance crew when the ride was taken down and that area will soon be replaced by a Wreck-It-Ralph show
I bet that robot is the most advanced looking thing Disney has ever created. I mean look how watery it moves. Very human feel
i went there in 2016, it was honestly pretty fun. the animatronic really impressed me! glad i got to go before it closed. the one thing i remember fondly is when the lights went out, stitch burps and there’s an artificial smell pumped through the room, and it was disgusting
What in the fnaf shit is this
😨😱😰😥
Stitchtrap
Haha, that reminds me of thConnection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends. And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend. My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours, and then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest - for you, and for those you have carried in your arms. This ends for all of us. End communication.
no because the sitch thing is so cute
I remember going on that when I was like 9 and I was terrified
R.I.P
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😭😭😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😵😵😵😵😵
I remember this ride!! It was sort of a horror theatre show of Stitch escaping and ended with Stitch interacting with Cinderella. Super scary as a kid but also super funny.
I went on it and it was scary as f
Shut up it’s a fact you don’t even get into it everyone it could be a fact
This ride was awful I remember going on it
😱😨😰😣
Fnaf 6 animatronics be like:

“Might be gone for good” stitch’s fucking skin is ripped of. I think it’s more than might be gone for good.

Stichtrap
Five nights at stich
Oop
This makes me really sad because I remember going on this ride as a kid and being so amazed by it.
"This was the most complex animatronic and was also really scary"  FNAF players: *trust me buddy, I've seen worse*
It’s crazy how it look like stitch to begin with but now it looks like that.😿
Withered stitch.
It looks like spring trap in stich s version
Ride traumatized me
This is why my favorite attraction is gone. They also got rid of pizza planet best pizza ever
Here's why this ride ended up failing. Originally it was supposed to be an alien Ride. Like the alien movie franchise. But Disney ultimately decided that it would be too scary so they came up with their own alien. A kind of centipede bug like creature. But again this was a little too scary. So they decided to change it to a Stitch ride instead. The only problem was they didn't change anything else about the ride. Just the animatronic. So everything else in the ride still acted as if you were in this really scary alien takeover ride. A lot of parents brought their kids into it thinking it was going to be a nice pleasant Lilo & Stitch ride only to be drastically incorrect
It looks kinda like plushtrap from fnaf. 😂
Ayo the new 5 nights a stitch’s actually do be looking scary 😧
Fnaf rl
Springtrap Disney version
are you telling me Disney capable of making irl Fazbear Pizzeria
Seeing stitch reminded me of scrap baby from Fnaf
what the fuck
What is animatronic man!
i went to this, but i just thought it was a person in a stitch suit. The more you know
soo creepy
I remember this ride, it was pretty cool, but not exciting.
Men i love Stitch I haven’t been on it but I really do like stitch :(
I remember this ride so vividly and I remember being so upset when this past time I went to Disney and learning that it was gone
Disney: Finally were done on the new ride! Me: it's alright Disney: cmon guys let's destroy this new ride with a Bouldoser and a wrecking ball
(Runs)
Five Nights at Stitch's Great Escape 😱
WHY DOES NO ONE SEE THE ENCANTO HOUSE IN THE BACK.
The most terrifying thing that exists is you
Stitchtrap
They didn’t appreciate his worth smh
That’s springtrap
Five nights at freddy's is this where you really wanna be
He kinda look like William Afton got squished to death because of spring locks that got called Springtrap because he got trapped on spring locks
BRUH ME A STITCh LOVER AND IM GOING TO DISNEY SOON
I loved riding the people mover and my favorite part was when they talked about the ride and stitch says "Miga naga Crista hahahahahah!" Over the speakers. They don't say that anymore but I still say it 🤣
Nah, it's the best ride ever. That building PERMANENTLY smelled like chilli dogs.
now this makes fnaf more interesting than before, scott cawthon… genius
five night freddy
😳😳😖😖😖😳😳🙀🙀😫😫😭😭👻👻💀☠️💀☠️
oml i remember that ride
u love him I am so sad I had
I've been there and it was fun
As a kid I loved that ride
😬😬😬😬😬
They tortured my man
Oh come on that ride was great I loved it
No way
It is true bc I didn't see it when I went there
I remember this show thing being shown to me
Ok my Disneyland didn’t have an actual thing we had this like video thing play and they’d ask the kids to pick colour of the door stitch is supposed to go through   I was terrified of that thing istg the idea that they could pick me cause my parents made me sit at the front f e a r
"Fun with Stitch!"  Use your flashlight to stop Stitch on the "x" before time runs out
Springtrap had a child
Jesus Christ, Scott cawthon was right about animatronics rotting holy shit
He kinda looks cool
Him: this is stich in disneyworld me: no this is springtrap from fnaf
Stitchtrap
Sheesh!
EXE
Is it that REAL!?
it looks like springtrap from fnaf and the endo skeleton thats his real bones
Real life mangle
thats stihs he was broke
But I will hack it and then send hi ibh I will be there at yung sinabi nya I will be 🧐🧐🧐
I've never such a smooth and realistic animatronic holy crap
Looks demonic!!
Aww look at stitch at normal he's so cute
SCARY
It is still my friend love him
It's just an endo skeleton. Every single animatronic has it. Everyone you gotta stay calm, y'all watch too much fnaf        ( I'm kidding but the endo skeleton part isn't a joke )
See that in the background that looks like a zombie thats what looks like the zombie stitch
😥😥😥
Now I want to know the whole lore.
>u> Is that a FNaF refference?
Oh no but i love stich
I actually liked the animatronic, what a waste 😔
I’m gonna sue them because of this
bro no joke shit my pants on this ride
Ight, time for the nightmares to start, night everyone
Disney is real scaring me away from watching that. Didn't know when I was 5 watching Disney
Gross Fact: In one part of the ride Stitch eats a chilly dog, then belches directly in your face, causing the smell vents to produce a stench similar to that of the skunk spray in Journey Into Imagination With Figment. This caused guests to become nauseous and causing some to vomit, which was one main reason why people hated the ride.
I know that ride
I remember this, I remember going on this “ride”
Oooooo
No I love stitch I am not gonna listen to you no more
F whoever said all that...thats my childhood bro...
I actually went there, they sprayed milk on us😑
This was literally one of my favorite rides whoever I went to Disney. I went back their year and went into Tomarrowland and basically cried to a worker because it was gone 😭😭
I remember when he farted on me! 😀
mf looks like a fnaf animitronic
Fnaf fans unite 🧍‍♂️
😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰
He still cute🙄
Video song pictures of Chucky Cheeses you are you
eeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!
Oh did i write that comment?? 😳
What did they to my fav character in lilo 💀
He part of fanf
Nah dude, I saw a movie that said “FICTION”, then became a reality, I REALLY DONT WANT FNAF to become one of my worst realities
I remember going to that game I loved it, then again I was also 5
Mom “ we have springtrap are home  Springtrap at home :
Apatow
That looks like a withered animatronic from FNAF
That place is evil dud
DISNEYWORLD WORLD WANT TO KILL US A KID DIED IN DISNEYWORLD A MAN DIED IN DISNEYWORLD DON,T GO TO DISNEYWORLD 😱😨😰😞💔
FNAF 😲🤯
Springtrap moment
this ride was hella scary as a kid 😭 i hated it
i actually went on this ride my first time at disney world. ima be honest i don’t remember how i felt about it. just excited to be there 😃
You are the worst attraction ever leave Stitch alone your mom doesn't love you
I really took 1 second thinking he was talking about fnaf
😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Inside it
I went to it
that attraction gave 6 year old me a panic attack cause for one part all the lights turned off and they made it seem like stitch was running around the room and then a bunch of alarms went off. I’m glad they took it down
Dude the animatronic stitch doesnt look that bad the movement pretty realistic
Where’s purple guy at?
ughh i wish they would bring it back id love to see stitch :((
That is weird
No
Stitch is cute
😢ieud and a meeting at a meeting tomorrow morning as well as the next few days to get a good
😵😫🥺😭
Fnaf five nights at freddys
Oh I remember this it was kind of terrifying for a Disney attraction I think in the end the was a vid of him escaping into the parks. Or maybe I’m wrong.
I remember going on this when I was in middle school while on a field trip
Five night at Stitchs
For a quick and not looped explanation, there was a lilo and stitch ride but closed down to be revamped as a horror alien ride, so the stitch animatronic was left to rot, the end.
Why most of disney animatronic when broken its looks like fnaf 3 animatronic
*that moment when you’ve gone on the stitch ride and loved it*
That is so sad 😭🙉😭, ... They can fix it all up again, create a few job opportunities... idea's
Imagine bringing that to life
I  been on that
This is worse than Burger King foot lettuce
Noooooo he was so cute
Yep
I loved it :(
This was one of my favorite rides at disney. Man time flies. Sorry stitch. 😔
Dofbeivejdhd
I love lilo and stich this makes me sad
Aswell as being rushed into the park the attraction was also built where an older very popular attraction was (can't remember the name rn) and the stich one was basically a more family friendly version of the older one so many people were obviously upset.   Okay I'll go now 💃
That was one of my favorite rides at magic kingdom ☹️ I remember going and not seeing it and me and my family were so upset
I remember that thing when he burped up the chili dog man that smells so horrible and it was a crummy crummy event
I remember when I was younger I got scared the heck out that robot
I loved this attraction when it was still at Disney! It was my favorite. Now that it’s gone it doesn’t feel the same. When I went there a few months back I was just so excited to see Stitch again, but when we got to the part where he used to be at (forgot what that part is called lol) he wasn’t there anymore :(
This was my favorite attraction, I loved it so much 😭
If stitch looked like he did BEFORE I would be tempted to hug him
As a kid it was always my favorite and it made me cry the first time we went back and it was replaced it made me so mad
I seen something like that in a Creepypasta
I remember watching that when I was little
What scary is when I was five I was there
Springstich
Thatis from FNAF
+Abadaca dabra+
÷abada ca dabra÷
×abadaca dabra×
-abadaca dabra-
It really reminds me the animatronics of fnaf games 💀💀💀
And we still don't got encanto which almost 69% of earth likes
I wish this ride still existed but now it’s being changed into wreck it ralph
“Back when I was younger”   I remember that ride 🥺   Edit 1 month later: WOW GUYS THX FOR THE LIKES! Most I’ve ever gotten 😂
I've played fnaf too much and now I'm just thinking that it got burned
I don't understand why people called it a flop when it was actually pretty funny and interesting, the burp stitch did, and everything else was amazing.
Stitchtrap
I’m sensing some fnaf lore here
Stitchtrap
Pls I want more creepy facts
It's not creepy it's kind of cute

FNAF is coming to life boys
"This is stitch!" Slow down, Grab your bible prey like your trying to make your soul arrival

😧😳Wrfretgewc

That looks like Weird terrefying 5 nights at freedy
YOOO I REMEMBERED THAT
😰😰
No that’s me bigmouth a creepy pasta
Imagine re using the old animatronics that were used in the past to make a FNAF REMAKE.
İmagine making the most complex animatronic only for people to shit on it
I loved that ride, it was one of my favorites.
Lol he looks like the phantoms animatronic in fnaf 3
Fnaf vibes
They built another one and shut it down to in 2012
Me: "when I was a baby I had a teddy bear of that"
I would love that ride
Terrifying ?  I want to have that in my room
They actually tore down this attraction completely and now it’s where you meet stitch
People just don't understand how hard they make animatronics to make us happy and your ruining it
Stitch needs some stitches
🏃‍♂️          🔪  🐨
How do I for get this movie
The animatronic movements is smooth
Fnaf players would not step 10 meters of that thing
I watch this at Disneyland... I never go to Disneyland again in my life...
Bro shit looks like enard
Eyo thats Ignited Stitch lmao
Bruh is fnaf ever gonna end
I’m summer going to Disney World but I’m not gonna come
Five night at stich
What the fuck is that???
Fnaf vibes
Aww poor stitch, I've never seen the attraction before but if it was  really that bad I hope we get to see a new stich attraction one that isn't rushed
I remember going on this ride, I loved it, sad to see how the ride has aged
Zombie stitch looks like Springtrap on fnaf
Now I want a 5 nights at Disney world
“Worst attraction” why don’t you do it and see if yours is better then the one they had that moved so smoothly??
I went there and it only lasted like a couple of seconds and it was horribly creepy in real life..
i see mirabels house in the baby under the back!!!!! #_#
No i ok
the little springtrap.
3090: stich:IM BACK
Anyone wanna work as a security guard at this attraction? Note:Company is not responsible if incase the animatronics kill ya.
Welcome to five nights at stitch
This is the same spot Alien Encounters was. And that show was way better. We went in 2016 and watched this show. Wasn't that bad. But Alien Encounters was better and more scary
It is not even scary, it is just like the bones of human but robotic, I guess if you say that, you are scary too, because you have bones.
Scott: EUREEEEEEEECAAAAAA
No wonder i was terrified of stitch
I went on the ride when i was 6
Five nights at Stitch
😰🤢🤮🤧
Broooo I rode this
I remember this ride it was terrible
I Mean I Like Stitch..
Oh my God, I remember as a little kid going and seeing that and I had so much fun
I Stitch!
Yo for the first time i was thinking it's springtrap from fnaf
What! I use to like this ride! Damn aint nobody fkn with the great escape? Nobody??? Aiight… 🚶🏽‍♀️
STITCHTRAP
It definitely looks like fnaf
“this animatronic dose not exist”
Poor Stitch😰😰😰😰
i know that monster the tpy fection creat that but they become monster. and. toy fection all full of monster aline also
This is be very cool robot on some scary game
This was my favorite Disney World ride when I went in 2011. I was 7 years old. I loved the animatronics and I loved how the ride would black out, and you could feel Stitch moving around, messing with your seat, and hitting you, even (it didn’t hurt). It was really cool to little me, and I’m pretty sad that it’s probably gone.
Such a waste of a animatronic
Fnaf???
Stitchtrap
Oh hell nah I'm going to move
Nooo
God..gatta tell my bff,ahead LOVESs stitch!She's ganna be heart broken..
Stitch really done said "i aways come back'

Pi never rode it but I would love to ride it
Pi never rode it but I would love to ride it
Noooo! I loved that experience when I was little! 😭
Stitch is not a zombie it was only an animatronic stitch so it gets old and its whole skin turned into skeleton
They just wanna make a FNAF Disney version ✋ you can enter at night guys! Very fun
That ride gave me nightmares within 5 minutes
I went to this ride!!!! I was like three and it scared me so bad i started crying
I loved that ride
im a gamer and I’ve seen worse
Hahah I remember going on there as a kid and crying because it scared me and my mom had to take me to the monster Inc. Show thing to cheer me up
Rode it way back when, the harnesses would bounce on your shoulders and it was so forceful that even a child felt pain afterwards. Bad ride and did no justice to a great film.
😰😰😰😰😰
Scary 😨
fnaf be like
Me: nah b Runs to sister to shake her for tricking me that that THING is cute
i wany that to be a mask  legit looks cool
They made him so realistic
Noooo poor stitch
I actually got to go to that ride. In my opinion, I really liked it! Mainly because I loved Stitch and just getting to sorta see it in real life. My mom on the other hand didn't like it because he spit on her lol. I'm glad I got to see it before it went away.
I loved the stitch attraction people overreacting
Stitchtrap
Stitchtrap from 5 nights at treasure island.
😭😭😭
I went there, as a kid. It was fully in operation, and no, not when it first started. Sometime in 2010-12
Not my friend liking Stitch
Haha FNAF 6 connection terminated go brrrrrrr
It's movements are so fluid holy crap!
I would have loved that lowkey, to bad I wasn’t alive when the ride was made lmao (Nevermind I’m stupid)
Dgfrttryuuuop😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😨😰😣😖
Idk why there was horrible reviews because when I went there on the ride in 2014 it was so fun and amazing!
I WENT ON THIS RIDE
The animatronic looks really cool actually but damn
I was on that thing
I actually went on that attraction it wasn’t even very rememable
the animatronic is werid lookin
I saw that! He spoke to my parents in the crowd :) named a planet after my mum, it was a good experience
Or or or or or or or or or or or
Honestly I never knew this
Oh pls don't tell me it's going to be an fnaf and I'll have an another night mare 😭😭
I went on that ride it was fun
Creepy as frick
Jdgid😱😰😰
That was one of my favorite rides..
Excuse me did you not ugly stop saying that but he's the cutest thing I ever had and he is a great pet to have probably but I just don't want people mean
Five rides at stitche's
I went on that ride at Disney it was scary my brother cried
The fact I remember going to the show watching it and having a literal panic attack is wild 😟
I remember this I would not leave my mother alone tell we went there and he spat on me
O my omg I’m so tired  Good night
I got on it
I play doom this isn't scary to me
my friend was traumatized by this ride
that was my favorite attraction:’)
It was a good attraction to me. 4d. Scared the crap out my kid
How about killing this trend of unnecessary loud pitch mikes
Mm, *STITCHTRAP*
I remember going to this once it was ok had a few funny bits but nothing to write home about
R.I.P Stitch Animatronic
That ride scared the shit outta me. I loved Stitch and I fucking knew how those lasers behaved! I wasn't about to be shot!
I think it was just being repaired but ok...
I’m sad the original ride that was the there is gone. Never got to try it out :(
*triggered afton noises*
Fnaf?
Fnaf lore
What the heck! I went on that ride in 2016. We must’ve gone before this happened.
It's been so looong
😱😱😱😱😱😰
Dame I liked that attraction
I remember loving that ride 😭
He’ll be back, he always comes back
I was there once, in the attraction, I thought it was awesome and got chosen at random to get sprayed but water(which was a thing) I have a stitch stuffy from there.
Please don't whyyy 😭
I went to Disneyland in 2014 and I really liked it, even the stich animatronic. I don't know why they say it's terrible for me, it's not.
Lol i have a suggestion for Disney,ya know all these Disney abandoned animatronics that are creepy? It would be dope if they were all in a museum,for horror fans,or like a Museum w any creepy animatronic and dolls to ever exist,i may hate horror but i would pay to see a museum like that
bruh thats a real life springtrap
I was never allowed to do the Lilo and Stitch attraction and I have little to no memories of ever watching the movie. I actually don’t know why I wasn’t allowed to ride it or watch it.
That attraction looked legit tho
😨😨😨😨😨so .......
Stich fazbear?😂
You sure he wasn't a real alien That looks like a rotting zombie to me More than an animatronic.
Gotta say Zombie Stitch low-key cute
It’s boring the seats didnt even move when I went on it before it closed
Dude I love stitch and did not know that happened
Omg I actually got on this ride when I was a kid!
Free nightmare!!
I was on the ride
🙀
I remember when I was small I loved this attraction. I also remember the funny smell after stitch burps
Yeah this is obvious
My phones charging but it’s going down
"That's why they got a man to wear a costume"
I went on it when I was little and I liked it
Honestly I think that they should use these in a Fazbear Fright like ride
*”The animatronics do get a bit K I N K Y at night…”*
Disney is making to much animatronics
Idk man, I liked that attraction :/
Legend has it there was a serial killer who is now trapped in the animatronic
One thing I miss is the talking trash can that came out the bathroom
OMG I WENT ON THAT RIDE!!!
This ride made every little kid including me CRY it was so scary and he would always spit in our eyes
For others, this is one of the scariest things they’ve seen.  For horror game players, it’s a normal sight on the job
I LOVE STITCH 😭😭😭😭😭
This is literally just a phantom stitch
Very scary 😟
Five Night's at Disney is real
??????????
Freddy: who's this animatronic? me: WTF that's a new fnaf animatronic
Stitch looked really cute and I'm a fan of the movie since I was a kid, would have loved to be on the ride ;( wishing it comes back some day
Bruh how did it WALK?!!!
Fnaf
Fnaf be like
This is was my favorite ride…. I’m so sad
I hate seeing this guys vids at night
Ok. Getting real five nights at Freddy’s vibe here
its cute is it not :( ?
That's a shame Stitch was awesome
Nahh that’s stichtrap
Nooooooooooooooooooooooo😩😩😩😩🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲☹️☹️☹️😭😭😭😭
imagine sleeping in a hotel of disneyland and seeing this video...
I went there when it was still open and I was one of the people that got spat on
I’ve been on that ride he like spits on you I think
I remember going back to Disney and seeing the sign that it was closed and now that I know why it's horrifying I asked my mom because stich was my favorite movie and we went on it last time we went to Disney
👀
I remember that attraction it was cool
My my lord that should be in fnaf
I know when stitch cause I watched the movie don't blame him at all I'm a 5 year rolled kid and I never been to Disney world
Why is this even on the YouTube you should just put it on Facebook cause I am a 5 year old so you did not want to tell me that and I'm only on my mom's phone and my birthday's and July 28 so you might want to stop
I've been on this ride like 20 times
I've been there and horrified me and my dad in the dark me and my dad left 50% of our stuff in there
He looked cool though, why was it the worst attraction?
It's withered stitch
I used to love that one
I’ve been there once
THIS IS LIKE FIVE NIGHT AT FREDDY'S AND I WANT THE STITCH ANIMATRONIC TO COME BACK BECAUSE THE NIGHTMARE STITCH IS A LOT OF TEROR.
Wtf
fnaf vibes
😱😱😱
What the-   Yes this is what half of the animatronics- wait no sorry ALL of the animatronics look like with out their little suits that you think make them so cute. THIS IS NORMAL! WHAT IS WRONGE HERe?
😨😰
I was traumatized my this ride my mum had to hold me the entire time. Also I am now scared of rides that have stuff pop out of the dark
Steve Jobs stage you are so scary with me
Yeah, I've gone there before, but it was a LONG time ago, he definitely didn't look like that at the time.
Poor stich😪
I don’t understand why people hate the ride but when I was a kid I absolutely loved it. 💙💙💙💙💙
I know what’s gonna be the next animatronic in FNAF
Looks like a dismantled animatronic (e.g ennard)
That is scarryyyy lmao is this the scary fnaf version of Disney land
Yay this is the channel I go too for Nightmares
😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😱😱😱😱😰
We all know how this ends 👀
That attraction scared my whole family including me idk why till this day
Am I the only one who find this cute❤😊
I remember this attraction. The lights would go out, and stitch would burp super loud and you could smell the burp. I can’t really smell that stuff, so I got hella confused why everybody held their noses 😂😂
Come from Five night at freedy
I thought that was spirngtrap for a second
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😵😵😵😵😵😵🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Ah yes…                            *stichtrap*

It's all fun and games until you stand infront of the thing, get a phone call and hear, "Hello? Hello hello?" On the other end.
Shame

Why did I think that the movies cover thing said bitch?

The animatronic moving in the video looked pretty good actually.

Sombbie shic

Si dat robot 😱😱😱😱😱😱
Nawwww he still there,  btw the ride has multiple dimensional speakers, so you can hear where stich runs, I wish I had headphones like that 😢
I remember going on this ride on December 2015. It wasn't to bad it was nice to finally sit down and enjoy something after walking all day over the park, the only thing I didn't like is that stitch burps on you and there this insane chilly dog stench that just burns trough the sensors of your nose it almost killed me
Hate to tell you it’s still a ride but they made it more fun
BRO, it's fnaf
“Put that thing back where it came from, or so help me!” 😀
Endo skeleton
stitchtrap
FNAF Be Like:
Many in chapter 2 in five nights at Freddy bunny truns zombie and something is defferent truning red he truns red panda so creppy big 🧠 but is sacry 😱😱😱
They keep it to honor his death in Vietnam
My favorite character- gone 😭😭
I remember this attraction, I was in first grade when I saw it and was absolutely horrified. When I got out I was in tears, it's funny to me now but at the time I felt like I was in a real life horror movie
did someone get hurt?
but why?
Yo he burped and spit on me bruh I remember that shit
Yo the new five nights at Freddys game looks awesome
Me trippin on how that bitch was legit walking   NOOOOOOO Stitch is gonna eat us RUN!
The abandoned stitch would be awesome as a design for horror movie or game
mf really said "I always come back"
Springtrap
Confirmed FNAF Came from Disneyland
Five Nights At DisneyWorld
Five nights at stitch
I went to Disney world when I was 4. I’m now 21 now and remember that ride scaring the crap outta me 😂
My favorite ride, I wanted to go on it one last time. I cried when it was closed around the Not so scary Mickey event... never got so sad in my life
All this dude talks about are abandoned theme parks and restaurants
Aww man. I actually loved that attraction when I got a chance to go. Mostly because I was like 13 and really loved stitch but still. Gonna miss it, should it really be gone for good
Terrifying Thing exist,Literally my stitch stufftoy and angel stufftoy sleeping with me EVERYTIME-EVERYDAY AND EVERYTNIGHT

😱🤔😮
"Five nights at Stitches"
Man turned into a fnaf character 💀
OH MY GOD I REMEMBER THIS THING! THIS WAS THE YEAR I WENT! IT WAS SUPER WEIRD
😐😣😨😰😩😭
In California or Florida
My childhood
Stitch trap?
A flop? How?! It was one of the best times in my life
Lol FNAF
I thought that was spring trap at first 😭
I was there and i was 8 that was the most traumatic experience ive ever had  it was even scary
fnaf vibes lmao
That animatronic looks like some fnaf shit
Guess k1ll¡ng 6 children wasn't enough  •-•
Thats just their robotic skeletons or whatever
It’s the guy from FNAF
Chuch E Cheese That I Most Scared Off
i remember going on this ride literally right before they announced it to be temporarily closed :‘(
"I always come back."
I personally loved stitches great escape 🥲
Yeah dude I remeber when stitch shot me 24 times and peed on my wounds and the n proceeded to nuke russia with me as the nuke, after that he poured my slushy into my eyes and gouged my eyes out and ate them, soon after he ripped out all my hair, flesh and nails until I was a mere husk of a human being, tuff for a kid my age
Well I'm never sleeping again
The "terrifying thing" is the endoskeleton of the animatronic, which I've seen plenty of them in my life, so it doesn't creep me out
Heaven is the best place ever. There will be mansions and you will reunite with family and friends there. If you want to go there just believe that Jesus is the son of god and that he is god by flesh and blood. Believe that he died on the cross for our sins so that we can go to heaven. Admit that you are a sinner that deserves hell. Spread this message to others to save others and tell them to spread it to others too and so on. Do it now because time is running out. Do not be ashamed of Jesus too. Make the gospel go viral! Jesus will also forgive as long as you ask for forgiveness but that doesn't mean you can keep sinning. Jesus is also coming back and we do not know when. He'll ask if you spreaded the gospel and he'll know if you are lying. When he's here you can no longer ask for forgiveness or regret your sins, spread the gospel and pray. You can no longer do those things when he is here. Jesus is the only way to heaven.
I saw this in IRL
Is this what you call *FIVE NIGHTS AT STITCH*
Bro got a dead soul haunting that thing 💀
the ride before this scared tf outta me as a kid and is ingrained in my memory lol
Dead
I remember being 7 & terrified because he was so TALL!! Not only that, but they had people strapped down & he’d go ballistic. I remember him jumping on the bar & hurting my shoulder to where it was sore. Not only that, but he burped & you could smell it. I had nightmares for a while 😭
Damn lucky I got to see it
POV:FNAF is real😨
What!? stitch is zombie!?!?
What yall mean he spit on you?
When FNAF lore
Well I'm sleeping with the lights on.
YOOOOOOOOO! How could they do my boi Stitch like that??!!!
I remember this
I HAD TO COME ACROSS THIS HUH!?, I'm a big stich fan and this makes me sad bc he is an angel 😫😭
But i wanted to see it again
NOO WHAT THATS GONE I REMEMBER THAT SO WELL I LOVED IT 😭😭😭😭😭
Legit looks like something out of FnaF
Glad i got to experience it
Im gonna scare my cosine mwaaaahahahahahahhahah 'cosin:shows vid' my cosin looks like :😱😱😱😱😱
Hopefully the attraction, along with Hawaiian Tiki Room Under New Management with some improvements, makes a comeback in the near future improved to better satisfy the guests.
Oh this brings back memories, when I was 6 I went for my birthday and was terrified this attraction
Sad how people worked so hard on it, just to stop it because of a bunch of Karens 💀
Literally fnaf
Oh I thought he was springtrap
YO I WENT THERE WHEN I WAS YOUNG I WENT ON THAT ATTRACTION OMG
Mf be lookin like Mangle from FNAF 2
😐What...
I was there!!! It was disgusting!
Just have a person with a custom like chuck chesse
Adults suck. These rides are made for kids and they basically ruined it for them. As a kid on this ride, I loved it. It was so cool to get a 4D experience and see the animatronic that I really thought was stitch. I wondered what had happened to it. Its so sad.
Ayo 😳
Springstich.
I remember that attraction. I was five or so at the time haha.
Aw this is kinda sad I remember the spit it was so fun tho
Now terrified from the thing I adore most?
I got a nose bleed from it, I was on this ride when I was like 6 and I remember a part of it was someone hitting the back of the seats but instead of it being a nice affect I got a nose bleed from it. I was probably too short or smt.
First thing on my mind seeing this :  Animatronic failure
Stitch: scary af Horror game players: "I've seen worse."
Did you know in Disney train they had micky trying to do a thumbs up 👍 but it looks like he’s doing the flipping you off finger
FNaF mangle be like
Damn they really did our boy like that.  ✊😔  F in the chat for Stitch
I remember that attraction. The awful smell almost made me throw up, it was disgusting.
It do be lookin like Ennard though 😂
i love that ride but the fist time i went i sat right behind the speakers and it still scares the crud out of me to this day
It's  an alien 👽😳
Bro the first photo looks like spring trap
That’s horrifying
Stichtrap
i was really young when my family and i went here. i vividly remember him “spitting” on us (i think?) and i started crying and had to leave with my cousin and mother.
I love stitch whyy
I went on this. It was ... good. But I would totally go to stitch zombie ride omg. I hope he eats people’s shoes off lol
stich looks like springtrap
Bro the memories
I'm having fnaf flash backs
Never explains why it's terrifying
actually i thought that the animatronic (before being decommissioned) looked pretty dope, i would totally go to see it
I remember being tramitized by that ride.
😂😂😂
I went there before
I'm so sad it got closed stich was my favorite move plus I loved the attraction it used to be my favorite but now space mountain is my favorite ride
Bro looks like springtrap
But I remember going there to the Disney world and that was the scariest moment I've ever seen in my life i has 5
Did this ride slapped I hate that they closed it
Your giving me a nightmare
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Ohmegushilovestitchheisonmyprofile😍😍😍        if you can read this you’re amazing
Me: ummm what is this 😵💀
The Alien attraction that was there before stitch, and was basically the same attraction, was THE most terrifying thing at Disney! It always had kids screaming and crying when the lights would go out and the alien would escape. It was NOT fun.
WAIT I RODE THAT? YOOOOOOO I COMPLETELY FORGOT IT EXISTED THIS IS A WELCOME MEMORY
No no please reopen it, take my money that’d be so cool
I love that attraction tho :(
Worst attraction?? I loved this as a kid lol sure it was scary but only if you were a wimp
Dear God 😨😱😱
So like I been on this attraction. And that shit gave me nightmares… I’m glad they closed it down cause it was terrifying for a young kid like me back then. I was terrified the rest of that day and possibly the entire rest of the trip.
Stitch era Sonic is creepy it is so creepy
i went to that attraction when i was five and most of the time i was bored. the only thing that bothered me was being sprayed in the face with water and the seat vibrating
I remember this ride and I fucking hated it!
''8 years ago by cheesecake'' THAT USE TO BE MY REC ROOM NAME
FR MAN?
😖
This attraction smelled so bad bro 😭😭
*me thinking the banged up stitch was a fnaf character for a moment
Does anyone else remember stitch peeing on you? 😂
😭 why stitch?
Omfg i got in that ride as a child– THE MEMORIES JUST SLAPPED ME–
Well I'm glad I went to it when o did. I loved it and the slime and effects were on point.
Fnaf fans be like : Ey Look its Mr. Wiliam Afton
nonsense clout chaser
you always makes things so complicated
''Animatronic'' hmmmm huh fnaf IRL
Geidhwjdg. Decided vejhbxjs and then we decided on a honeymoon to do 5 in a few years ago 5'-
Ngl he kinda looks like spring trap
Holly Molly fuck
Jesus, it looks like that because it is not cover with the final layer that gives the final aspect of the Disney character. We look horrible without our skin layer too so STOP, just stop.
I was there when I was five and I Was horrified
yall remember when he would spit on you  💀
I remember it!when he burpedddd and you could smell it and he spit on you and wet stuff got on you people thought it was boring?!!😭😭😭he’s dead noa🤞😭😭😭
Little
Bro stitch on some stuff
Bru I went there win I was litter it shouts out water form it’s mouth
I actually went to there when I was 6 and it was one of the coolest things ever
Actually they closed the ride because I was 7 years old and really afraid of the dark and I screamed like I was going to hell and kinda broke the seat and tried to run out
The fact that i am a huge stitch fan who has a full room of stuff about him….
I remember this and literally being terrified, I was like 8.
I am about to go to Disneyland with my kids🥹
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO MY CHILD😟
Bro new fnaf life action Scott? Just a UNHOLY suggestion.
I remember this attraction I was 6 years old and I remember when me and my family was in there and didn’t it like squirt out water or som or blow out something
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😺😱😱😱😡
I think about 2016 was the only time I went to Disney and saw that
I remember going to a stitch attraction in japan disneyland. It still exist lol
I was there, I went on the ride. It’s horrifying.the lights ran out, he burped and spit and breathe rob your neck. I didn’t stop screaming.
I never gotta go on that because 1. I was in Puerto Rico and 2. It was closed because of this🥺🥺
I remember doing this with my mom a few years ago! I heard someone shout that stitch took his phone 😂
Springtrap
New fnaf games looks fire 🔥

This is rather sad than creepy
NOOO I LOVED THAT RIDE 😭😭😭

I remember that!  I went in 2013 and 2015.  It was really cool and honestly pretty scary lol...
You ruined Disney for me I love stich I hate  you 😭😭😭😭😭

Me: Leo and stitch being my favorite Disney movie 😢
Cough cough fnaf cough cough
I loved this ride so much fun

Poor Stitch

I remember that attraction I was younger but i remember when the lights went out he would burp it was my favorite ride I hope they bring it back
Noooo that was my favorite show 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Poor stitch
I remember this place
The first one looks like springtrap ok I don’t wanna think about it haha
Aw man I wanted to see stich but I had no money to go 😭
Ahh
You forgot about the fact that it was actually a re-theme of another ride called ExtraTerrorestrial: Alien Encounter. I highly recommend watching a video of it on YouTube, it’s legitimately terrifying.
Aww he looked so cute
THAT THING CREEPS ME OUT
I remember that, i was one of the select few whose asses got “scratched” by a quick cold air with pressure going past it
Oh heck no that’s creepy as hell because if I saw that in my life I would run in my room and do a backflip and then I will just go on sale
he looks like springtrap
I grew up with lilo and sitch I was born in 2002
The Burp of 87
that's literally my favorite attraction! I  went to Disney world back in 2010 and I distinctively remember this one being my favorite, I loved how fluid the animations were compared to the rest of the animatronics. He almost felt real!
I went there this year and it was replaced with Monsters Inc and I loved the stich thing it was soo much fun as a kid
I went to this it made me cry because there was liquid coming from the ceiling and that was creepy
…..well I liked the ride 😢
Is it me or does he look adorable
Fnaf
Tbh I kinda want it for home decor
Gone to the waste land,rip stitch great escape
No...stich...my one and only favorite Disney movie...WHY!!!?
Har har harhar har har har har har haaaaaarrr har har ha-haaaaaaarrrrr, har har ha-haaaarrrrrr

Stitch is best
Omg nooooooooo my favorite Disney character
Me thinking of The afton family and how they possessed animatronic LMAO
Bro that'd fuckin Stitchtrap
Fnaf go brrrrrr
The next dlc of security breach will have this
I actually went there before. It was kinda cold in the inside but it didn’t really matter because it was hot outside, but I remember that stitch would burp and It was the worse smell known to man 😭
😀😀
;;;
Uh I loved this ride!!!! It was great for the people that dont like roller coasters
I remember riding the ride and when it burped it smelt terrible but then it shutdown and I never rode it again
Omg I remember going there and it was kinda scary cus you can literally hear stitch in the background running around
I remember this but it was not very Cuba do we only did it once
I remember this. I dont remember how old i was but i was super young, all i remember of it was being TERRIFIED when being sprayed with water
Springtraps been quit since this dropped
AYO FNAF LEAK ??????
That ain’t stich that’s soich
WE WENT THERE!!!!!!!! My sister loves lilo and stich we were on one of the last things
When we went to Disneyworld there wasn't a ride, it was a thing where you stand in line just to see Stitch for like 10 seconds.
Imagine watching this at night.. couldnt be me lmao
Omg its springtrap
The animatronic characters, do get a bit quirky at night...
Fnaf.
Whole FNaF lore in few seconds
wait i went to disney when i was five so in 2013 i went to disney. i’m 100% sure i went to see that attraction. 5 year old me was amazed by it i loved it.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
In 2015, I remember I was terrified on that ride, when he burped you could smell it, and he started spitting on you non stop. It was a okay ride but I feel bad how it turned up like this
Bro that’s springtrap
I remember walking out of that smelling like chili dogs.
I REMEMBER DOING THIS it was so fucking scary
It can’t be only me who thinks he’s cute like that tho
looks like springtrap, same color looks like there is human remains in it
What the f***
Five nights at Sitch’s
Ooooo Springtrap s
Wait…. I remember that THEY KILLED STITCH
spring trap now stitch trap
I used to think he was cute he still is but the terrorfying thing under neath
Dude why does it look like springtrap
tbh I feel bad for stitch
Why does this exist
Oh.hell.naw
I smell a Fnaf fan game
I feel like they can scrap it to make it a roller coaster and include the stitch animatronic
Bro turned into springtrap
Omg I saw that as a kid
5 nights at stitches
AAAHHHHHH IT LOOKS LIKE MY GRANDPA
i guarantee, GUARANTEE, that some of those reviews were made because of the old attraction being removed for the new one
"This is what stitch looks like-"   Me : I KNEW IT !!! IT'S GONNA KIDNAPPED LILO NOOO !!
*Stitchtrap*
I went on this ride and they had speakers and they would put scents through them and it made a fart sound and I shit you not it smelled like rotten asshole
Ennrd
If you think that thing is scary, the goblins from Escape from Gringotts at Universal Orlando are worse. I knew someone who worked there who showed me what they looked like without their skins off
I loved this ride as a kid
I want to that place before I have not seen that but I have seen that part that I mean that ride but I wrote it and then stitch was even cuter even hug them!
, 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I rode this once. I thought it was alright. When stitch burped and had that smell, it stuck with me the entire day. Not the best experience lol
I miss this attraction so much 😭😭 I loved that animatronic!! Only got to go on it a handful of times, but the pre-show was so fun ;-;
They suck at making such
I loved it as a child. Boooooo them
Stitch's great escape? More like Fazbear Frights
Imagine building an extremely complexed robot just for no one to like it
Dude I liked that ride
scary
,,The animatronic Characters Do Get a bit quirky at night.“
Omg I think I went to that in second grade when I went to Disney world  Although I remember something about people being sprayed with water like it was spit or something....? Idk about that but that's what I remember from it lol
It was scary I’m glad it’s gone
Fnaf is going to be real
My sisters went on this ride when I was a baby
Fanaf?
What the shlt
Stitch did the bite of '87
I remember going to stitch's great escape as a child. Im sad that it's gone, especially since it's one of my favorite disney properties.
five nights at stitchie‘s
I remember going on that
OML I WENT ON THAT WHEN JWSS 4
That's why you don't talk trash online kids, stitch is there for revenge 😊
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱

I remember the last time I was on this ride, I was still living in my childhood home. It went down 2016 and it has never returned, and it's 2022 now.   Last I heard, they were gonna replace it with a different attraction.
Tbh I perfered the normal stich...
That's fnaf lore going on here 🌚
bro be lookin like springtrap ong💀
I love stitch 😭
“39 inch stitch animatronic” -this video  “Could’ve rounded up to 40, Disney!” -MrBeast
FNAF fans Hoping no one will stuff a human body in there making a withered stich
me : *home aloen* HELL NAH CUH
I remember going to this as a kid I was scared but it was kinda fun anyways rip stitch
Wasn't that the one where stitch went to different places like the top of the ballroom in the castle Belle is in, and other places? I must have been so young
Kidd this attraction
It’s so sad that Disney would do this to my favorite character of all time 🥺😭
FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S IS REAL!!!!
Is this ride gone now? Because in 2016 when I went, I remember this as one of the most boring rides 😂 you kinda just sat there and watched stitch play around, maybe occasionally the seat moved, but nonetheless it was a pretty cool animatronic.

Yoo I loved that attraction when I went :(
This was such a funny attraction…I miss this so much.😩
I remember how much I hated that ride and how I cried from the smells
FNAF Owners would love him!
This thing scared me when I saw it- I would show my mother but she loves him so much I cant just ruin tht 4 her-
I remember this ride it was fucking terrifying and I lost like 3 bakugan during the ride
That is traumatising
This thing is stright out of fnaf
Wait stitch?... I have heard that before WAIT THE FNAF BOOK-
I never got to ride it
stichtrap
Me :total did think that this was a springtrap nuh uh
It looks like springtrap lol
I THOUGHT I WAS A SQUISHED PICTURE OF SPRINGTRAP AT FIRST-
This is stitch. Me: YEET THE PHONE
I remember this attraction ride as a kid and I didn't think it was boring at all, damn people just can't be entertained by old things anymore unfortunately, I found almost frightening as a kid and to hear so low reviews of it and see everything stripped away is pretty sad, rip our childhood memories.. :(
New ideas to FNAF: FNAF Disney - most dangetous animatronic: Withered Stitch
Him:why does the thin ex... Kid attraction
Five Nights at Treasure Island 6
Okay that ride right there ruined my childhood when I was a little six or seven I don't know how quite old I was in 2016 that was the scariest thing I've ever done.
That ride scared me to death and those images don't help lol
I went on that ride
NOO MAH BABY
I don't get why they hated it I think it was adorable
I loved this ride but as a young child it scared me out of my witts
I actually went there and saw it
Aw hell nah disney got the Springtrap
That looks like if stitch was spring trap
😶
The video: this attraction was so bad and everyone hated it so it came to close it in the future.  Meanwhile everyone in the comments: it was my favourite attraction so sad it closed.  Me who never been in a Disneyland   park before: *confused af*
I remember that attraction I went there once in 2016 when I was younger I guess I was lucky since that was probably my only chance to see the fixed animatronic with my own eyes I didn’t realize it was one of the worst rides and it was going to be shut down
:(😱😱😱😱💔💔💔😭😭😭
Ok
Thing looks like 000 Glitch from the anime
Am I  the only one who never saw a animatronic in real life ?
maybe there is a creature named snitch I think
Perfect for a Ork Gargant.
You mean to tell me animations are robots and they have wires?! 🤯🤯🤯🤯 like I don't get why people are surprised
I remember that shit it was scary as hell
MF LOOKS LIKE AWITHERED ANIMATRONIC
Honestly that stitch animatronic looked really good
He looks like grumpy
i dont know why youre popping out of my shorts but i hate it
So sad to see the attraction close! It was me and my brothers favourite one!!
I was there a few weeks after they closed it and I was sad cause it was one of my favs
I LOVED THIS RIDE WHY DID IT HAVE TO GOOOO
I went in that right before I think it went down before then I got even got born...
😭😭😭😭 I LOVED IT ! when I went there as a child that was one of the most memorable
Bro I went on that I thought stitch was going to rip my head off
Me thinking of fnaf
OMG 😶😧😨😱😵😿😿 night animatronics hmm 💀👮🏰
Withered Stich
We went there last week!
When I was little I went on Stitches Great Escape  I walked out of that with trauma, when the lights turned off and people started screaming because they were being sprayed I started crying  It terrified 5 year old me
I remember riding/ watching that. It was back in 2015 lol
I remember crying so hard because it was dark on that ride and I was like 5 and if that mother fucking robot looked like that when I rode it and I saw it I would probably have a heart attack
I hate Disney
I remember going years ago! I think this was the one where we breathed on your shoulder you could feel him spit/breathe/sneeze, and you could smell the burp! It definitely wasn’t that good
I'm scared 😱 😨 😳 😫 😔 😢 😱 😨 😳 😫 😔 😢
God, I remember going there with my grandparents. That thing was terrifying to me as a seven yr old.
If someone doesn’t make a Disney FNaF game without this Stitch ima cry
RIP stitch😔
They closed a scary alien ride for the stitch ride.. they kept the concept of the ride but replaced everything.. I liked the original.
Im more hooked about Life guard 😏😊
OMG😱 i'm fine and i i see you
Looks like springtrap
They still have the attraction in Japan’s Disneyland!! They don’t have the animatronics but I love it!!
I remember riding this is 2015 and it’s was terrible you were in rows of chairs and all that would happen would be he would rip one and it would be TERRIBLE I felt sick after
I went in 2007 and remember that nasty ass burp and smell it gave off with the seats 5d experience
fnaf
I remember that. It wasn’t good but it wasn’t bad either. I’m kinda sad now that it’s gone
Math
I remember going to that attraction. It scared the ever loving shit out of me! It was the creepiest thing ever.
At first i tought thats springtrap- Anyways i love stitch! I lost my bow when i was 6 at disney land and he came near me he hugged me and pretend to fall to make me laugh! I had the best day! Ily stitch sm even if he looked like that lol
Oh hell no-
FNAF really exist
Oh look it's stichtrap I wonder who is inside ?😈
I loved this ride what the hell
FNAF 3 REFERENCE!?!?!?!? 😳😳😳😳😳😳
Soon all of these disney attraction anamotrinoc are gonna come  back and kill
I know why the animatronic was possessed and almost killed someone and he's still alive today 🤨
I went on this ride in like 2006 and it literally scared me for life. I was about 5 and the lady said that it would be suitable. All the lights turned off and we were sat in seats that meant my mum could barely hold my hand never mind comfort me. Even now I won’t go on rides unless I can see exactly what they are or a member of staff can explain what happens on it.
D- Do any of you think that this animatronic looks like one of the animatronics in FNAF?
No stitch is amazing no bad rates should be on him
Looks like a FNAF withered animaronic
I went when I was seven and rode on it In June 2017
What park
hes scary now l'm scard😢😢😢😢
Omg fnaf
Stitch got spring locked
When I was little I remember crying when the lights turned off and I heard stitch and my dad ran me out of there
*disneyland FNaF*
Waiting for someone to make a horror game with this
I think you just ruined stitch for me
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
It reminds me a lot of springtrap from fnaf 3
Does anyone know how could I buy him  I’m bringing him back
Wow a cheesecake didn't even   like the amosmenr park maybe it's was going eating to much
Before being called "Stitch's great escape", the ride used to be called "Alien Encounter". It was based off the movie "Alien" and was much more terrifying than it's replacement.
Bro I’m fighting whoever said it sucks
Shame I liked that one
Looks like stitch never escaped😳
ahh they still have this attraction in Paris. at least last time i was there
so
fnaf in a nutshell (fnaf4)
Bro stitch looks like springtrap
Bro why didnt they added it in 5 nights at freddy
Five Nights at Stitch's
Naahhh he will come back. You may ask me how? Bc that is spring trap stitch edition !
Ik

Plushtrap
I remember when stitch peed on me when I was a kid, great trauma ever from that attraction there haha
Stitchtrap haahahahah
Was a dope show
So sorry 😢 so sad 😭
Spring trap child be like
I remember this ride! When i was little i went on it, for some reason when he burped i started crying cause i was scared lmao
This reminds me of the Norman video he made
they MUST make a fnaf fan game out of this lol
I’ve been on this ride before and they had like this thing where it’s consider as 4D where you can smell certain things
That attraction was the only memory I have of when I went to Disney 😔
🥺no
Bro he looks like a fnaf  character *At the first 2 Miller seconds*
FNAF fans: FNAF references?
How dare they dump a cute baby blue💙
Um that look like Springtrap more

Willian afton i see you there
They did my boy stitch dirty.
Help Me Kids Use This Sound 💀
"Animatronic" OMG
I rode the great escape ride once as a kid and I thought it was awesome I’m sad it’s gonna be gone. It was fun to me 😊
Welp, Stitch is now going to join FNAF for vengeance against all the people who said Stitch’s ride was “the worst attraction” and for his ride being closed down.
they should add stitch to fnaf v
Is robot I don't scare
Looks like springtrap
This is some scott cawthon level shit
😟
The fact that all animatronics really does looks like that when the internals are exposed
😖😖😖😖No!!!!!!!!
😨😨🤢😨😨😨
:( :( :(
This is stich in fnaf 4
:)
Stitch animatronic. V.S. Chuckee Cheese Mouse animatronic
The smell after Stitch burps is probably why the reviews were so bad, ngl
NO WAY!! I WENT TO THAT RIDE WHEN I WENT TO DISNEYLAND! WOWIE that’s wild to think about, I thought it was kinda cool how it was a 4D (?) experience, I remember it rather fondly :(
Ah I remember going and I was TERRIFIED 😃 good memories
Five night at snitch 3
That looks like Enard from fnaf😂😂
I whent there 3 days before it closed down
I low key loved that ride when I went there as a kid, sad to see stitch go like this.
At this point that's just springtrap lmao
Spring traps pet dog
Why is Disney doing this to us- is this why my parents won't let me go? Lol
Looks like it became a phantom (Fnaf reference)
I went there a few years ago and it's still active.
PLEASE all of the fnaf commenters not all things animatronic have to be related to a game i swear you guys always ruin the comments for me and bro the stitch animatronic is dead let him rest in scraps
that loo so terrifying >_<
It's that a stichtrap
When I went it was not that bad.
stitchtrap doesnt exist,it cant hurt you Stitchtrap:
no thats my old fav cartoon
It freaking Looks like A Fnaf Animatronic
The next thing to happen is 5 kids goin' missing.
*sniff* *sniff* I smell FNAF
“StawppP I didn’t do My makeup yet”
stitch look like sptingtrap ngl
So stitches Great escape actually took over an older ride, I'm trying to find this ride online if anyone knows it. But anyways you used to win a sweepstakes to go up to space and it was really scary at least when I was a kid. And that's why I didn't like stitches Great escape because it wasn't as cool as the first ride.
Plush trap
ok?
Five nights at steach escape quest
The Disney version fnaf
Stich pulled a springtrap card
Really life FNAF 🤣
Oh no this is a five nights at Freddy reference
Me: seeing he is a Expirement like Poppy playtime
You summoned a massive fandom, good job
And we get one more animatronic to add to the list of the bite of 87
This ride actually scared me when I went to Disney
I feel like Stitch should have put more SOUL into the act
That's some fnaf shit
I remember this one, his burps smelled horrible.
He spit on you right? If I’m thinking of the right ride
Well, this animatronic will hunt people who hate his attraction
That’s why they have a real person acted but when I went to Disney World all the characters were gone for supper stitch
I feel kinda sad. This was one of the few rides I remember from my family's make a wish trip. Rip stitch animatronic ride
That's weird because I went to that attraction and it was pretty neat
*CRIES IN MY FAVORITE RIDE AT DISNEY*
Of course this appears in the night now I can’t go to sleep
IT IS 12:21 AT NIGHT, IMMA HAVE NIGHTMARES
OMG IVE BEEN THERE WHEN I WAS A CHILD
Springtrap
Stitchtrap
I still remember that sat on beside a purple shirt guy ...
Not gonna lie, stitch has been rough
Be a shame if someone makes a five nights at Freddie's parody with these animatronics
DESTROY THAT DISNEY WORLD THIS PLACE IS FREAKING SCARY
I was scared haft to death first time I was thier
Wow the FNAF LORE keeps getting weird with the new animatronics
*Stitchtrap*
Wtf
I remember going on this and the lights continuously going on and off and then stitch making random weird noises. I’ve forgot most since but I remember not liking it because it was very boring and generic
Stitchtrap doesnt exist he can't hurt You stitchtrap:
Its cool why did people not like it???
This is why kids don't go to music parts or adults probably didn't say no they can ruin everything
*FNAF fans enter the chat* "Security guards better watch out until 6AM... withered sitch is coming"
New fnaf leak
me when i hear the word animatronic:THERES A SOUL IN THERE I JUST KNOW IT!
What the hell what happened to stitch
What is wrong with him anyway?
You monster
Autumn Monique: ...BUT I LOVE THIS LITTLE GUY!...
I remember that show, chilli dog breath smellovision was bad idea
I was on the ride and it was my fav now its gone and now i really dont go anymore idk why i just dont like any other ride:/
No fnaf people?
MICHAEL. DONT LEAVE ME HERE
"this meaning it's the best animatronic" Freddy Fazbear: ......Good to know...... Good to know.
You all make him angry , now prepare yourself on every night... _he's gonna come.._
Kinda looks like springtrap
major fnaf vibes ngl
That was myne i have that to
Lmao how could you be scared of this when your literally a walking bile of bones that's attached on flesh
🤖 praise our lord 🧠 thank you for being our savior jesus Christ 🌍
Looks like from a fnaf fan game
This thing terrified me
Maybe they where trying to fix it? Who knows😗
You forgot this attraction was made of the scraps of an another attraction that was more of a sci-fi horror attraction, they made it stitch to bring in kids and more money.
Disney : "Withered stitch can't hurt you he's in our hands🙂" Fnaf: *buys stitch for a new set of animatronics*🤝  Also Fnaf players/fans: "well what if it can?"
I loved that attraction :(
Guess he went to a pizza restaurant
I actually went on a ride like this back in 2014 elite memory👏✨
I love stitch
I went to this when u was younger at terrified me i cried the whole time
I WATCHED THAT
It is gone unfortunately. I was there last summer and it’s replaced with I believe a monsters inc attraction
I actually personally liked the attraction, i was the one that got spit on though, i think that this was the same place maybe not but i do remember being spit on in the dark when i was a kid
I went on that ride and all the kids were crying and I ended up with horrible back pain
Springtrap lol

I loved this ride! I liked it when it was just the alien ride, before they made it stitch. I was so bummed when it closed
This is going to make me have nightmares
I was on the ride when I was 4 years old and I always wanted to ride it again and after watching this video I was crying 😢
It is gone. but I don’t get why people hated it, it was a good attraction at least in my opinion

Every time you do this I hate it
I loved the stich attraction 😓
That was one of my favorite rides when I went there! How dare they😭😭
I don't think that lio and stitch
Phone Guy : Uh, Hello? Hello Hello? Uh welcome to the first night of your shift. First of all you have limited power so be careful since.. stitch gets a bit quirky at night. *stitch noises* Uh I have to go. Be careful. Nightguard : Uh oh.
Five nights at Stitch 💀
i went on that and it was wicked
Is that damaged or withered stitch?
I went on that as a kid. It vomits and spits on you, shakes your chair, and screams. I am very glad that it was taken down.
It’s not gone because I went a couple years ago and I met stitch and got his autograph in the aria called stitches great Escape
Ewwwww creepy and cute
THAT AINT STITCH THATS B-
𝐻𝒾
This ride scared me as a kid😂
I actually went on that it’s was not fun I was very scared and some people got spit on
Bruh like the movie but I don't like the animatronic
i loved that attraction noooooo😢
Imagine waking up to THAT thing starring at you. Yikes.  0.0
My childhood is brocken
People who said it was the worst l proof them wrong
You are calling stitch ugly are you he's my favorite
OMG
When I was little and I went on this, adults and kids were crying lol
"Five nights at stiches."
That like spring trap
Man got sold to Freddy's pizzaria
I remember that attraction and there was thus stink gas and as soon as they pit out the stink gas 🤢🤮
I remember it it was my favorite
Springtrap ? Is that you?
“He always comes back”
Ayo😳
When i look closely stitch look like spring trap
Springtrap+stitch=stitchtrap
Me and my sister loved that attraction, we would always go there when we went to disney world
Nuuuuuu not Stitch!
I got to go on it once, I liked it, but the burp was awful
I can speak like stitch
I can speak like
People: Thanks to these animatronics, oUr LiVeS aRe RuInEd AnD oUr ChIlDrEn ArE hAvInG nIgHtMaRes! Freddy Fazbear: Am I a joke to you?
it looks like belong on fnaf fan game
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
I went on this around 6 years ago I don’t remember it much but I do remember it wasn’t bad at all
I went in this a long time ago when I was 5 and it scared me so bad
Quirky
It stunk so much in there while it was happening
"Ohana means... I OOF YOUR FAMILY AND NOW GONNA OOF YOU"
I REMEMBER THIS RIDE it was one of my favorites due to it not being a roller coaster or overly scary for me, man I was so sad when it was closed
My favourite movie is  Lilo stitchso  I’m so 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭sad
Dude I remembered going on that ride
I remember this😰
I can't lie i actually thought that was yoda
Cool
I 💙 stich
NOOOO THIS WAS MY FAVORITE ONE
I might have to make a game based on this
I always come back
my man became springtrap
There was one in Hong Kong Disneyland quite a while ago (give or take 8~10 yrs), and it is a live performance/interaction mascot Stitch game that I went to twice. It was fun but it was mostly for kids or tweens. Eventually it shut down and got transformed into Buzz Lightyear Shooting Ride, then Marvel took over. It brings up good memories every year I go there.. I just miss the nostalgia of it.
Aww i remember when I was a kid I went on the ride, I really liked it! I’m just so sad that it’s like that now :<
Noooooooooo 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wait so...those animatronic skeleton seems so much similar to fnaf ,so...are these actually ACTUALLY how animatronic skeletons looks like irl????
Stitch looks like spring trap
OMG ITS PEEPAW AFTON STITCH
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
im sad  im goigtomiss that Blue Furry  guy😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I lived stitch’s great escape it was so fun as a kid
“The animatronics do get a bit quirky at night”
This is honestly sad because that was literally my favorite thing ever at Disney and I only got to go on it once, idk why people hated it so much, it was awesome!!!
I cried on that attraction because I thought the chairs were gonna start spinning.
no like  that  guy!😔😪🥺🥺🥺🥺😦😧😨😰😥😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ok animatronic is good but the rotting was horrifying
The new five nights at treasure island game is super realistic!
😭😭😭😭😢😥😰😨
Looks like afton 💀💀
):
Boo
It’s gone lol been gone
I went on that ride! Ioved it!
Wow man thanks for giving me nightmares and paranoia for the rest of my life
I don’t understand why ppl didn’t like it. I remember seeing it and loving it!
I went on this attraction twice when I was younger. It's so weird to see that animatronic in it's current state. What the hell
I got to ride that ride. I enjoyed it. It used to be an alien escaped type ride that I LOVED when I was even younger. It really was pretty similar, only the Lilo and Stitch version was a little less scary
😰😰😰
I dont think that ride was that bad, ive done this ride before, tbf all you do is sit, so its more like a mini show
I remember going on that ride
Spot the difference: HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHIHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I went on that ride!!
i liked that attraction🫤
Omfg so cool😱
Wow 🤩 that is so cool
“OHANNA MEANS FAMILY”
I remember that
Five nights at stitches
Is it just me or this gives me spring trap vibes
Imagine seeing this in ur hall at night when you want a snack at 3am
I remember doing this as a kid, all I remember happening was sitting in the dark and I felt little drops of water, I was terrified that there was some monster that was about to eat me or something lol
So
Cool
I remember going to that
I remember going in this ride as a little kid, kinda sad that it’s gone
*Wool studio* should buy it and make a fnaf  horror attraction out of it!
That's really unfortunate. That was an amazing animatronic! Now it's really scary
I remember that ride. It smelled so bad when he ‘farted’ or something cuz it was supposed to be ‘immersive’. I liked it tho
I am peeing
This reminds me of fnaf
They Made Stitch Into Springtrap he has the Same Colours of him but he can be called StitchTrap If there's a FNAF Design of him If you think about it
How
Stitch is popular lol😂
My brother want to said “I’m not ready for level three” it gave everyone a laugh!
Oh shit im disturbed......
The withered animatronics in fnaf be like
Mf Looks like hes from fnaf 3 lmao
Stitchtrap 📸🤨
fnaf irl
Idc  I still like him.
Me: he's so cute Later Me: MAMA!
I think he is cute and adorable but this is  not a real thing
Its like the most creepy movie
Literally five nights at freddys but in Disney. Lots of kids in Disney too. Let’s hope afton isn’t real
ITS SPRINGTRAP
I loved this attraction tho…. (Also my fnaf brain immediately went ” The animatronics do get a bit quirky at night” so imagine getting chased my that… seeing how terrifying it was to my sister when we were little)
Nope not gone it’s in disney land Florida
Lilo has a big forehead
It looks like a an anamatronice from all fnaf games and even now that I know that dark secret I get the chills but it doesn't bother me so i'm fine but if it's like those animatronic from when fusion z gamer was playing an amusement park fnaf game the animatronics were bigger than the door way
Scrapped Stitch
Excuse me he is not terrifying I love stitch I had a dog named stitch and he died 😭😭😭😭
I remember riding this ride and no joke I HATED IT literally it burped and you smelled it and one time a monster grabed my FEET
It looks straight out of FNAF
I went there
I went on this ride he farted in mah face 🤢 it had vr headsets
It was so good though
No I love stitch
Childhood: 😵 Me: 🥲 well I guess it’s gone
Looks like springtrap
I loved that ride :( sad to see not a lot of people really enjoyed it like me and my family did.
I feel like youtube is doing this to me on purpose TvT
Aww 😕I love stitch
Why😭
Nuuuuu
I went on it in flordia a couple of years ago it was still there?
YOU THINK THE BROKEN ONE IS TERRIFYING I THINK ITS CUTE
This was my favorite ride 😭
do i smell fnaf here
lol stitch my fav Disney movie character lol
1: it’s been a long time sense it seen the light of day, it’s not coming back now.  2: it not hard to see why it said  was the most complex robot in the world I mean, LOOK AT HOW MANY WIRES ARE THERE
I remember riding that ride as a kid at 4, I’m still traumatized
It made stuff smell like shit too
Hehehe… Stitchtrap *HAHA*
I believe the animatronic caught on fire and that's why they shut it down.
Ok I’m not the only one who loved this ride I don’t understand although I probably liked it so much because I was 5 but still
Poor stitch
It's kinda cute ngl
I went there i still remember the smell
What nooooooooooo WHY
Sadly I didn’t even exist back in 2002. 😅
We went there in 2017 on the last day before it was shut down. Truly one of my favorite attractions but, sadly good things don’t stay forever..
I went to that attraction! Wasn't as exciting as I'd assumed but I still loved it! The lil guy spat all over us xD
Nah that’s a fnaf stitch
No
That ride was so fun tho, when I went on it was amazing.
😱😱😱
I went to that a long time ago, stitch said it would spit acid at us, and water came out of holes under everyone’s seats. I was scared by stitch ever since
I think it’s cap
I rode this when I was little and hated him burping and spitting in my face
"The most complex animatronic" MAH BOI YOU MET WILLIAM AFTON?
I went on that ride and I still have to sleep with a light on and I'm now 13 it was a horror ride.
I just noticed something when it shows them all surfing go on the Disney World map and then you’ll see a small island and it looks exactly like the place that they’re surfing at
It burned down because of an accident
You should do a video on the old abondoned Cranium Command ride at Disney world, the main animatronic went missing and the building’s interior is in ruins, hydraulic fluids on the floor and cracked tv’s
This is my new favorite thing
I remember going into that ride.
😰😰😰😰😰😰😨😨😨😱😱😱😱😭😭😭😖😖😫😫😫😭😭😭😭😭😢🥺😢🥺😢🥺😢🥺😢
I have so much toys of him 😭
NOOOOOOOO I LOVE STITCH 😭
Honestly I would still go but I think that’s only because I have an unhealthy obsession with stitch
I'm glad I was able to go on this ride before it was shut down.
It used to frickin "Pee" on you and things would bite you when I went there.
MY BABY STITCH :(((
It broke down-I think
Holy shit I remember going to that ride I got “spit” on lmfao
I did it once got terrified and was so happy it got goned
I love these Disneyland secrets 😍
Finally Springstich
I remember when stitch Burps  it smelled bad and it was a amazing attraction
What the hell’s
I rate it 10/10 I like stitch
the image at the beginning looked like springtrap
I remember when U was little that was my favorite attraction and now that I’m finding out it’s done for. I don’t really wanna go to Disney Word. That’s the only reason why I wanted to go back ☹️
Fnaf😳
It is it. This will be our end. We will become a night guard and get killed by these things. Lmao
“This THING is terrifying”  Me: it’s a goddamn alien what do you expect?
I loved this as a kid!! It scared me at first, but I liked being scared! I thought it was cool that it would cut to him being in Orlando and climbing on the castle just wreaking havoc.
I actually went to that ride, or at least something like it. When the lights would turn off and stitch escaped and you were locked in ur seats the workers would go behind you amd touch ur shoulders. I was really young then so i was actually traumatized. I now HATE being touched from the behind.
No but I loved that ride
My child hood its ruined
😱😱😱😱
I remember that Attraction and I had wondered what happened to it
Stitch, you forgot to put on your skin this morning.
They got frustrated and scrapped
Spring stitch
NOOOOOO NOT STITCH!!!!!!!
No offense,but the fact that this is a lie-
POV: Your favorite Disney character is stitch and you still like it even though it's a zombie looking stitch
Bro I thought this was some fnaf video
i remember going to that attraction in (i think) 2012. i remember when he was supposed to be in the vents, slime or some sort of goo got on me and a bunch of other people
So scary
Lowkey was one of my favorite attraction thingy
Brooke I really this (old memory unlocked)
The times I was on this attraction I had a fun time so idk why there was that much hate not saying that people can’t have opinions I just don’t see why it got *that* much hate but oh well
Atleast it still have white teeth
I went there when I was little and not sure if it was the same one but I remember seeing stitch and being in the the room
I remember that when I did that ride it jumps on your shoulders (pushes down on your shoulders) and since I was so little and kind of small for the ride it hurt super bad and gave me problems with my shoulders.
Fun fact : I was terrified of this animatronic
Imit😱😰😭💦
😱😱😱😱😱😱😰🦋
This was a great attraction
Bro the most complex animatronic in the world is Chuck E. Cheese. He kills children
That looks like springbonnie
Why did Desi hi. Steep Secret I'm literally going to freak out like right now I'm getting the creeps
What the ....
Five nights at stitch's
Imagine if you het a job by watcing Stich at night. AND then you blink and he's gone.
😱😱😱😱😱Noooooooo
How stitchface was born:
😱😱😱😨😨😨😰😰🙀🙀🙀💔💔💔💔
😡🤬
I remember going on that and it was always so cool and fun to do I never knew that’s why it was gone! Every time there would be lots lined up for it so why was it so bad?
What the heck is that thing
Why lord barbatos
I went on it when I was 5 and it was so cool but so sad that 9 now so I don't remember
William afton made an animatronic for disney?
I hate who seed that
Is it just me or does the abandoned  stitch animatronic look like springtrap?
I don't know if that is actually stich or a new animatronic for a possible FNAF game.
It's not terrifying it's cute
ITS SPRINGTRAP
I’ve actually been to this ride and it was pretty cool ngl, don’t know why they took it away from the park
Jk jk jk🤣
😱😥😥😓😓im only 4
lmfao at first i thought it was showing a picture from fnaf
First of all his not terrifying he's cute leave the poor guy alone
My second user in games is Cheesecake 😭😭😭
My mom looks better than that and that says a lot
The fact that grown people put hate comment on the show is just embarrassing
Kennst du das im Film
This was such a cool ride when I went aww
*William afton enter the chat*
NAKILAH            ROSS
Spring-Stitch
If I were a worker at Disney world then I wouldnt
I am fine of stitch but not that one
Oh so thats stitchface from roblox lol
Springstitch.
My best friends love stitch imaged if I showed them
Springtrap in a nutshell
i think the people who hated it were way older LMAO to each their own but when i went when they still had it i forced my parents onto it multiple times
Hahaha I was there and saw a show for stitches great escape right before it closed an hour before it closed actually
As a stitch impersonator I'm kinda bummed out
i liked the ride cuz stitch is my favorite LMAO, and the robot is cool
Nah cus how is this the worst when that monsters inc ride exists
This is fake. Why people actually believe this. This is what the animatronic be lookin like without it’s gucci clothes on
I remember going there at 6 and it was a TERRIBLE IDEA
Yep I’ll go
My family went there and that ride kinda terrifies me now you can’t ride it anymore but the lights would go off and he would go around and every other person would get messed with I got spit on and my brother got his leg pulled
:(
I can proudly say I went on the ride
awww the stitch animatronic was so cute!!!
whyyyy why him he to cute to be creepyyyy :-(...
It's the exo skeleton
I remember this attraction it wasn't bad in my opinion
I remember when I went on that ride
Poor Guy.
A well I went there like twice or smth
That doesn’t belong in Disney It belongs in FNAF
Damn, he do be looking like springtrap.
Five nights  at Stich's: Stiching it back together
that is NOT my baby
Five nights at treasure island
I never went to Disney but I would miss stitch and I do
That was my favorite ride when I went and I’m not gonna lie it was a little scary to 5 year old me
You ruin childrens life
i remember that attraction in 2016 i was so bummed when i heard they took it out i remember stich broke out and they spray water under your feet to make it seem liked he licked it
I'm gonna have nightmares tonight, thanks!
Maybe afton are thare before😂
When we went to Disney world in 2016 stitch popped my siblings shoulders and jumped off of her shoulders lmao I’m sad that he’s gone it was a fun exhibit
i was on that ride before imma let you know its weird
it Genuinely looks like as if fnaf would happen here. or the events that took place in fnaf
fredbear AM I A JOKE
I went to it once an did was realy cool! It was like a 4d thing 3veryone was sloughing to and stitch spit on us haha it was funny
DUDE STICH MY FAV CHARACTER
Everyone forgot about alien envounter
i remember going on this and getting stuck on the ride because the like the bars that go on ur shoulder got stuck i was like 6 lmfao
Stitch is tarfaning
Ugh it was my favorite attraction
I think I might’ve been on this ride once a long time ago. I was so young at the time that I don’t remember it very well. All I have is a vague memory of the animatronic spitting on some of the people.
We he said animatronic I thought Five Night’s At Freddy’s
When it’s still kinda cute-
Yes no
And then he got stolen
It’s withered stitch! Five nights at Disney’s
): i love stich 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
i was too young for this but i didn’t  hear the guy i came out of it shaking and beyond crying
I loved this ride when I was 6 😭
Stitch is very creepy online
No my stitch friend end im a kid end my name is lilo 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
It’s stich
🤯
No my poor baby
I REMEMBER GOING ON THE RIDE OMG 😭
I went on that ride
I actually went to this attraction when i was around 5. This attraction had given me a horrible fear of stitch for years. I still cannot watch a stitch movie, and I'm 16 now. To 5-year-old me, I was locked into a chair in a hot and humid room as this thing spat acid and then disappeared. I cried for hours after.
a bit quirky
Stitch looks like he's from fnaf 3 🤭
No that's just the process of making stich
I actually went in this thing when I was 8 years old
When was this?? Cuz last time i went there (2019) it was still the same.
This was the closest thing we could get to Five Nights at Freddy's
That's some fnaf shit over there...      And I like it ✨
This look like the animatronic in FNaF ngl
oh my god i remember this.. this ride scared me away from that area for so long my family would have to drag me to space mountian
Ive been in that attraction... the weird part is... he would run around sniffing and licking people... i was one person who got sniffed... 😢
The fact that he could walk…
Looks like it caught fire
I remember this attraction. I was young when I first went on it but I still remember loving how real he looked. The burp, being sprayed with water, and watching as he went to Cinderella's castle was one of my favorite moments! I do hope they remake it or at least keep it Stitch themed...
I loved that ride, it always smelt like chili dogs
I LOVED this part, we were waiting in line when I was little and all I could think about was seeing him in real life! It was one of the best experiences I had there.
I remember this! It was one of my favorite attractions and was so bummed when we went that year. I think this was being "fixed", and splash mountain too. My brother's all time favorite ride. And a few years previous, my mum's favorite ride, Maelstrom, was replaced. Damn...kinda getting nostalgic..
2000p
Five nights at stitches
😱
It was a nice show you could rest for a little
Me who actually thinks its still cute somehow (yes im a FNAF fan) : :< [keep reading please?]  The attraction's building has now been turned into a Monsters inc. ride. Well actually its more of a show and you can interact with monsters from the movie and honestly its really fun!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
But i love stitch...he is still cute💙
that’s withered stitch my guy
Nooooooo stichhhhh
This ruined my childhood
Do we get a new Fnaf in Disney style?
I loved that ride but those afton vibes kick in when u see that ded animatronic tho..
Bruh that shit came out of William Afton's lab
I went on that attraction when I was 5
Five  ight at freddys
They still have it at Tokyo Disney it was boring but then again I didn’t even understand what they were saying
Five nights at stitches 😂😂😂
It is fake I don’t like bitch I know what he looks like because he came in a happy meal before from McDonald’s so do you not play with me
Plot twist, they're just making a haunted house Stitch
Oh my god I remember this thing! God it was so long ago, I dont even remember how old I was
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The most unpleasant experience ever. I remember it being loud and smelly
I’m sad like imagine Stitch feeling bad coz he is not good😔
I remember being there the attraction wasn’t bad at all so I don’t get why it was bad
I remember this. It was fun. I enjoyed it. When the animatronic stitch wasn't visible his shadow was displayed crawling on the walls. Then he bruped and alpogized for it. And defeated the other aliens who were trying to kidnap him. Was a 3 D ride if I'm not mistaken.
I remember going to see it. It scared me when it showed up behind me. I couldn't sleep for a week.
I actually was there with my family in 2012 I believe and I actually thought the attraction was pretty cool, I‘m surprised it was considered „a flop“.
i think i remember going on this ride! i remember stitch was burping and stuff and sadly i was a bit sensitive to smells, so i got a big headache after :( it was a nice attempt but i don't think it was as fun as it could've been
I low key thought he was going to say this is what Stitch would look like if he was in FNaF.
😭
There was actually another animatronic sitdown ride called alien encounter before this even though it was popular it was quickly taken out for being too scary for the children at the park and the reason why the stitch ride flopped mostly was Becuase it was a sitdown ride it didnt have much movement and it had a full sense experience including a scent sprayer and the smell made most guests disgusted and sick to their stomach
i was really little when i went on that ride. when my mom asked if i wanted to go, i thought she said “stitch’s greatest skate” and i thought we were going roller skating i was very disappointed  if I hadn’t heard it wrong I probably would’ve like the ride, and i’m sad i can’t ride it again.
"Hello? Hello?hello?"
You forgot to add the part about the horrible smell
Why he look like spring trep lol at the start zombie stitch
WTF
This is what happens when you have no sleep and you're running on caffeine and then you see this... Nightmare fuel
This was the first thing we saw when we got to Disney World. The chili dog smell followed us for the rest of the trip and I can still remember it today 🤮
I thought the ride was good
Can I buy it
If you look good enough you might see Walt Disney's skull, the theory goes he ran from the ghosts of children that died on the rides and entered the suit and another employee activated it without knowing he was inside...
*Five nights at stitch*
I remember going on that attraction and it scared the crap out of me
I remember the great escape thing. There was water and that’s all I remember
I actually rode on that ride when it was still there and I honestly thought it was cool! Maybe it’s because I love stitch or because I was fairly young idk
Damn thats scary 😳😳😳😳😱😱😱😱
I used to love stick now I don't but can they put back stitch I still love him but it went back so you better go to Disney and tell the thing you will go to put back stick or I will be mad
OMG WAIT STICHTRAP THAT YOU?!
I was there to see that when I was little!!! It spit at us and some got on me lol, can’t believe next time I go it wont be there
FNAF vibes
Stitchtrap

i may be biased (as stitch is my favorite character) but stitch’s great escape was my favorite ride 😭😭
He just wanted to find lelo
I went there like 6 years ago it was so fun and creepy

I hope the purple guy isn't there.
I remember that place I went in there when I was young
I don't know what in the world those reviews were talking about, because that was one of my favorite rides. I was devastated when I went back for my senior trip last year and it was gone.

Why would they make an animatronic if they have Chucky cheese and if they make FNAF 1 it would be cool
Why do you like ruining my childhood
Stitch is my favorite 😢😢😢
Bro is springtrap ☠️
Ayo it's Phantom Stich, wonder if he's gonna get in FNaF 3
I’ve been on it twice once when it was alien encounter second when it was stitch
That's normal imagine a human without skin and incomplete too
Me while seeing this: NOooooOOOOOooOOOoo!!!
Dangg five night at stitch's about to be a real thing
I remember once going to one kinda like that, where you could talk to stitch. One small boy asked if he had a girlfriend. Props to you young man
I- But I went on that ride when I was little, it wasn't that bad.. 🥺
Looks like spring. Trap
Stichtrap
This whole video makes me remember Fnaf
I remember on the ride near the end they turned off the lights an made it seem like he was walking around.  They mad played sounds to make you think he was standing in front of you an they sprayed some breath thing to simulate him burping in your face It was like rancid chicken ramen
It's happening....

May my childhood experience Rest In Peace.
Bro I used to love that attraction. It was my favorite.
I love stitch you've ruined my day
Stitch trap
Dead bodu!!!!😭🤔🤕😱
Stitch more like stitch face
Just wait until some kids get killed by a strange looking purple man.
fnaf 3:
This reminds me of FNAF…… idk why
Lol I remember going on this when I was like 6ish when it started spitting and burping it triggered my fight or flight and with adrenaline pumping i squeezed out of the seatbelt and literally just ran out of the door screaming
He looks like the fnaf 6 alleyway animatronics
It moves so well how
scary house😱😱😱😭😭😭
Fnaf,holy f!¥*k
I remember this ride as a kid and I fucking hated it. Stood in line for an hour+ to sit down and watch a puppet talk. If there was an “entertaining” or “excitement” element to it I don’t remember it
That’s sad because that is probably still the best animatronic ever
I miss him!!!!!!!:(
Ok this is creepy but not that creepy
Fnaf vibes
OK that that is not stitch that is springtrap
I love stitch
Maybe it overall form but I remember waiting hours to get in as a kid just to be living a nightmare. The burp didn’t help.
fnaf
Uhh the animatronic characters here... do get a bit quirky at night...
😨😫😭😭😲😾👫👮
Now a 2000+ fnaf
I liked stitch’s great escape
Poor Stitch you needed guys to give him a hundred stars holy f****** God I can't even believe it if you want to be my friend I'm not going to make you my friend because you're ugly and I don't care if you're pretty and I don't care if you got a mansion no one cares about that if I don't care about it the others don't but if I don't care about it and the other like it don't care I don't care like I don't care I'm going back to Disney and I'm fixing Stitch right back up and you guys are not allowed to get in there anymore it's going to have a good life now
no but I want that terrifying thing in my bedroom, it's actually sick
Didn't a lot of kids get scared and leave through the fire escape? Cause I may or may not have done that at one point
I love it where can i buy it?
Don't show ld shadow Lady!!!
Freddy fazbear???
Burntstitch
Bro turned to Stitchtrap
Ah man I remember that ride it was almost park closing time and I went on that ride over and over again with my parents good memories.
Kinda like spring trap but its stitch
Nooooo😰😥
I loved this attraction, so sad to hear it was a flop
If they ever were to put that skeleton up for auction I’d wanna buy it
Nah that's stichtrap
WHATa
Stichtes great escape was a banger an absolute masterpiece. I don’t know why people hated it I thought it was quite interesting.
Yup remember this entirely
Fnaf  mods:
Oh no, fnaf is becoming reality ; _ ;

Aaaaaa😭😭😭
Looks like spring trap from fnaf or some shit
Stitch almost like our BABY YODAAA NGL😂
I miss that ride so much
FNAF

It dosen't look creppy.
Isn't this supposed to be kids mainly then why are adults making these stop 😡
Hold up 2002?            TURNING RED?!   (Turning red was in 2002)
No Disney world come back to me i'm scared 😭😭

Within Jesus Christ's teachings we find the plan for our happiness, our redemption, and our salvation, a divine blueprint that includes faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, keeping God's commandments, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.
Bro I just get crazy deja vu I’ve been on this ride when I was a kid
This could be added in five nights at treasure island. Zombie stitch
Fnaf 2 stitch be like
I remember this so well, it’s crazy! It was my favorite even if it scared the crap out of me the first time.
It burned down lmao
I loooved scary and creepy things when I was younger (and I still do) so I'm pretty sure I woulda love this except for the burping and spitting-
A lot of the comments I’m seeing are either:   1. I saw this attraction as a kid and loved it!   Or   2. _This scared the shit out of me as a kid_
I swear to god you just unlocked a repressed childhood memory of mine, I feel like I saw this attraction once when I was very little because I vaguely remember the burping and me being terrified of the animatronics and the steam sounds in the attraction scaring me. I knew I would have been there before it closed if it closed in 2016 so I think I might have saw it.
At least I'm going to Disneyland not Disneyworld
Dont people know that thats what animatronics look like underneath the outer shell? You cannot have a great mechanism like that without lots of wires and framework
I never liked that attraction when I was younger, but now I really miss it and I wish I got to ride it one more time…
Tell me the first pic doesn't scream spring trap energy , i mean the peepee yellow is too real for me
Fnaf 10
........😨😨😨😨😨
The FNAF fandom : "Did i just heard somebody mentioned 'animatronic' here?"
In short here's a very simple answer disney built park thing around show made animatronics well robots and then immediately abandoned it after a small or big drop in people coming well not even people more just income drop from it cause its no longer a somewhat big money maker
If that comes up to me and tries acting all cute or what not it’s going on a one way trip to Pluto
I loved this ride so much since stitch is my favorite Disney character
Loved this as a kid it scared the shit out of me but I had fun in the end
freddy five night
Awa freck idk why but im getting some fnaf vibes rn
Names for him:  *Withered/Old Stitch.*  *Stitch-Trap.*  *Savaged/Molten Stitch*
I remember I went on this ride when me and my friends were younger. My friend had hearing sensitivity and had to get off midway through cause all the ride did was make noise. Literally nothing else
bro I remember this ride idk about y'all but I really liked it, the burp was a weird smell but I think there's a warning that there's water on the ride?
I remember this, I thought it was the best. I was also like 6-10
Five nights at stich's
The stitch robot looks so real
I tough that was springtrap
When you realize that you hate animatronics beyond the fnaf games
No seriously that's stitches endo from fnaf skeleton

FNAF

Omg Jermy from fnaf
It looks so cute tho to me atleast
I remember riding this
I remember going to that attraction and I LOVED it! I can't believe people hated it that much :((
I remember crying at this attraction when I was like 5, I got a Stitch plushie afterwards. (I still have him)
I went to that… I remember…
Another celebrity ruined by drugs..
I watch it bofore
I loved this ride till it spit on my or something, I was young but all I remember was water getting in me. Shouldn’t have sat in a wet seat
I remember riding this on my trip to Disney world.   Tbh, I didn't like Stitch to begin with (cause I was a lil kid afraid of everything), and that terrifified me
I went to this!! He spit on you and water hit you!!! I loved this!
😨😨
I loved that attraction ;-; I remember how much fun I had at it
This was my favoutite atracion(is that correctly spelled?)
Kinda looks something out of fnaf
I WENT ON THAT ROLLER COASTER IT WAS CILD AF
Stitch rotted just like William Afton from five nights at Freddies I mean if you look on the Afton story you might see some interesting things
Yo I remember that
I saw the house from Encanto
I tried to go on that ride once but it just broke before it even started.
I got to go to it. I had never watched the movie tho so I was really confused but my friend loved it
Fnaf: welcome to the club
Noob
Noooo🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
😢
I remembered when I was young, I went to that place when I broke my arm. It was my favorite attraction and I remembered that Stitch sneezed right behind me and I thought he was real at the time(i even tried to "look" for him when the attraction ended. I always loved him, but it's so sad that this amazing attraction is gone..  This attraction and Stitch will always be in my heart, and I'm glad I saw him in time. Even if he isn't real.
HOW DARE THEY SAY THAT ABOUT STITCH
It could actually walk walk no other ones can do that
OK but dude why did you get solo waiting like so low ratings like dude I couldn’t even walk walk
I went and I saw that and it  was very creepy that it got more creepy
Bro looks like he came from Bendy and the Ink Machine but at the same time is Springtrap
Reminds me of FNAF gess
Nope I'm going to stay here at home
Stitch? More like Springtrap Now
I went in December 2015 and it’s one of the few things I remember!
I remember screaming crying on that attraction when I was 5-
Aw but stich is my fav
Stitch need help someone free him! And fix that man😏
I loved this ride and the line was always long so I didn’t ride it much rip stitches great escape 😞
When FNAF is coming to be real but Stitch edition :
I actually went onto that ride and the animatronic was amazing and adorable to me and my family
OMG I WAS THERE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND IT WAS TERRIFYING EVEN WHEN IT WAS OPEN
I remember that attraction, I loved it but i got a little bit scared when stitch messed up my hair
No
I went on that ride, stitch spit on me. Traumatized me lmao
I remember when I was young and the lights went out it scared me so much
Stich literally looks like a small Nightmare Foxy,I'm just gonna call it "Nightmare Foxittle",I just made up a new fan made animatronic
Nightmare fuel 🔪
The bite of 2022
I am sad that I did not see it when I was there
That endoskeleton…
How fnaf started….
i remember going to that and absolutely loving it
Damn I remember that. It was scary but fun.
Stitch is so cute tho
I remember going to this as a 3 or 4 year old and being absolutely terrified for no reason 💀
Bro the attraction is still there!
See I loved this attraction
😞✋
the Pictures Look like they came from FNAF
The worst? Strange... I liked a lot. Perhaps, people at that time were expecting more of the franchise.
That thing looks so cool
I loved that ride 💔
Oh I love that ride
Ohh my goodness I remember going I was like five and it spit on my face and it went in my eye and it would crawl under your seats and on the wall I was so scared I literally screamed yeah but it was ok 😊😭🙃
Bro he looks like spring trap
Mf looks like springtrap
My brother looks like that ugly thing
That’ was terrifying
When I was younger I want on that ride and I loved it and I still remember the lights going out and everyone's bracelets glow and green and I just love it
I like this ride
I was there
This is my favorite Disney character always have been and always will be micky creeped me out.
Mfs looking like fnaf 3 but without the spooki purple fellow
We got fnaf irl
I actually was able to go on this rude when I was 3  think. I stood on my tiptoes at the height measurement to seem taller, and the worker let it slide. It was an awesome ride, it's a shame it closed
Super good loop ➰➰
Talk about FNAF
So recently I went to Disney, and I went there for the 50th celebration and I'm very pretty sure where this ride use to be is where the Mike comedy show is now because, there are lilo&stitch themed colors and there is a stitch statue on the side of the building for the 50th celebration.
Someone needs to do a five nights at stitch’s great escape
Stitch looked good
I feel like that thing was springtrap from fnaf
I went when I was 7 and I loved it Icl, went on it multiple times Cus of the queue
DoNt WaSt YoUr TiMe
why do you hate Disney world
I remember going to this when I was 5.
But he’s so cute I’m almost crying😭
No
"Is that the bite of '87 "
I was there in 2015. I don't remember much of it, but it was not the best one for sure.
Noooo I love stitch
i watched that one!!
I think I once saw it because I once had a nightmare of alarms going off and everything and everyone started screaming and I was only young so this was bad enough for me
FNAF reference
Tbh it kinda looked liked Springtrap
Disney Stitch wanabe fnaf lol
Bro i cried after I went on this in 2014,it was so scary and personally I didn't like it that much but now that's just scary bro. Also I love the disney ones!
Stich trap
I still love Stitchy I love him he’s so cute
What i would love to see is a haunted museum ride. You sit and go through the ride, similar to the haunted mansion, but inside is all the old disney characters in zombie/ FNAF versions. Zombie stitch with his original voice lines moving around. Old scary scenes like the witch from snow white popping out. Anything that was an old ride, put into this one. It would be a scene from that original ride, but it would be nostalgic. They always have to make room for the newer versions of the rides, but fans can come to this one to see that one scene from the last time they were on that ride. Just my opinion
I still remember a year prior back in 2003 it was a different ride it was a horror alien ride. It was great, then it switched over to the lelio and stitch ride which had the same exact events happening except PG version back when I came back in 2005.
Dude what if fnaf was in Disney like stitch
Awww
😨😱😱😱😱😢😭😭😭
Its only temporarily closed *He always comeback*
i really thought that animatronic was from a fnaf fan game
I liked the attraction better when it was all original assets. Then they switched it to Stitch.
I would have loved that ride…
They could make some Halloween thing out of it
That's straight up terrifying.
That was fun except for that one kid always crying
Surprise Disney is trash
Theres an actual endo skeleton inside the animatronics its like fnaf
That attraction scared me So much  I had nightmares for like a week
I lived going into there with my bsf when he burped we would try to as well and when I recently visited I saw it was closed and got so sad.
I loved that ride it was awesome
Oh my God I am watching the Stitch series and it’s funny that you just said that
"Fnaf will be like"
I remember this thing. Didn’t it have some sort immersive thing like you could feel him play with your hair or something!
🙊🙊😱
Little kid me loved it though☺️
🥺🥺🥺this is so sad🥺🥺🥺  I love stitch😔🥺❤️‍🩹
When it said it was called the worst attraction I was looked how dare you say that about something stitch.(stitch is a fav Disney character)
In 2014 or 2015 i went to disney with my family in florida. It was a great day, and around a few hours in we went to stiches great escape. We sat down and the atteaction started, i was mortified, screaming my lungs out scared. And the spit/water sprat didnt help. When it ended i fell to the ground in the exit hallway sobbing. Im glad/hope that attraction is over
I went there and it smelled terrible
They could've kept the animatronic, it looked so cool
Someone make 5 Nights in Disneyworld
Bro stitch turned into stitchtrap dude
Every day we get closer to getting Disney zombies.
I remember that ride and I also remember being terrified of it
It looks like one of those animatronics from fnaf like ennard
I remember that they re skinned an older attraction to be stich. it used to be some alien horror thing before stitch. I only remember this because I went in the alien one when I was REALLY little and it scared the piss outta me. And then refused to go on the stich one the next time I saw it
When I was little I LOVED STITCH and I did not understand why people hated it, I miss it and they just need to make another stitch themed ride maybe not making him burp in your face…
I actually remember this this one I was pretty young so I enjoyed it but it was scary to me
If you think this is scary, don’t look up what was before it.
I heard it cloase down when one of the animatronics bit off the front lobe of a child after being dared to put his head in the animatronics mouth....
I remember riding that they let out gas from him burping and it was foul
I love this ride! I remember it!
Oh great FNAF in real life🤦
Im sorry i didn't remember ;-;
Poor atich
Plushtraps cousin
Stitch
I liked it lol
Stitch Trap
"Connection Terminated."
I went on it it was very weird
I remember being there!! All the adults were miserable and me and the other small kids were laughing out butts off, good times 😎
I went to this attraction most likely at least a year before it closed it was my first time at Disney and I was obsessed with stitch so much I still am I even have a plushy of him angel and a baby stitch that I got in my most recent visit
IM NOT GOING TO DISNEY LAND THERES MANY SCARY STUFF GOING ON
That shit was so ass it was the first thing my family went to on our trip to Disney Stitch’s breath was horrible and was scary for even some of the older people not just little kids
C.C is the oen whos first die next elizabeth next meachel next clara the last one is william
And elizabeth afton died from circus baby she got scoop too
And cris got scoop by glachtrap when cris birtday
And william afton died from glichtrap
And clara afton died cus she got car crash
Meachel afton bllying cris but he got scoop my ennard
Afton died
Its from afton its fnaf
Okay, if I find the people that said it was bad, I would literally punch them. Like, if I got to se it, I’d literally cry, because, well, I’m obsessed with Stitch. Imagine if they brought it back 🤩🤩❤️❤️💔💔🤕🤕
i thought it was a fun time
"This is what stich looks like, let me explain. 20 years ago this ride shut down and this animatronic broke"
I remember going to this attraction, worst part was when he burped and you cpuld literally smell it! The smell was horrible, and after it was all over, i kept getting the same scent randomly wherever i went in the park. I had no idea what was really causing it, so i spent the whole day walking around and getting that awfull smell randomly.
I know the story about stage it's a shame that this ride has died but the film will live on in our hearts rest in peace Stitch Escape😭😭❤
I would’ve loved that if I was born then stitch is my favorite Disney character and has been for a long time
They put that   to not go I like stitch   is fake
I don't understand how it flopped, I remember going there as a kid and had a blast. The smell of the (burp) and the (spit) that flew at you
I used to go on that attraction....I LOVED stich, he smelled so bad 😭
LOL I remember this it’s literally so boring u pretty much sit in the dark the whole time and hear sounds nothing even happens
Me whos obsessed with stitch:NOOOOO WHYYYYYYYYY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Istfg I saw this last time I went like a year or two ago, was I going crazy?? I have been inside the attraction before, it was a lot of fun
Damn
Me sad now bc I have two stitch stuffed animals
"Conection terminated"
This is spring trap from FNAF 3
Dude that demon scared me to death
“Worst attraction”?! Let me see for myself🥺
I remember seeing it the First time i went, but it closed down the day before 😭✌
Aww. I liked that attraction
"At the time, was the most complex animatronic" Image the millions of kids they fooled (including me ofc)
I loved that ride 😢
Stitch looks like spring trap
Let's just hope it wasn't made by some guy wearing purple
stitch looks like springtrap from fnaf now haha
I enjoyed the Stitch attraction in 2007. Or maybe too young to really tell
Five nights at freddys made irl in the form of stitch
Stitch looks like the bonnie from FNAF 3
This attraction was so cool though
*fnaf flashback*
I remember
I was on that when I was 6 and i remember something touching me and spraying me with water I came out crying my eyes out never forget that I have it on video💀
Springstitch
I actually really enjoyed this attraction as a kid.
It isn’t really meant for adults it is meant for kids. So not the people rating the ride! I remember riding this when I was younger and I loved it.
I went to that attraction
I LOVED THIS ATTRACTION SO MUCH AND WHEN WE WENT BACK WHEN I WAS 12 IT WAS SHUT DOWN AND I WAS SO SAD
stitch looks like hes gonna try to get me to go in water while wearing him as a suit
I never knew this attraction was gone.
I REMEMBER SEEING THIS WHEN I WENT.
I remember going on that and I got so scared when the lights went out
Me watch    me realize i have Stitch in my shirt
My kids were petrified of this ride. I thought it was hilarious.
Hi :D
Withered stitch should be a fnaf animatronic
Noo he dead:(
So cute
Bro this thing terrified me when I was like 7 or 8 and now I am 15 I still dont wanna go
They just re skinned an old ride that got closed, I'm pretty sure it was an Alien ride. And I don't think the animatronic was ever called "The most advanced animatronic in the world", the Wicked Witch of the West was for a bit but not Stitch.
I remember going to this ride actually in 2018 I think I thought it was pretty interesting
I’ve been on it I thought it was good
Damn he kinda reminds me of ennard
Hey stitch is not terrifying love stitch so much
I remember this ride! It was like 4D with smells and stuff. Some random pulled one of my braids as a kid and I thought it was Stitch for the longest time. I remember even asking the character actor of Stitch why he pulled my braid and was very mad at him when we took pictures together. Sad that the attraction is gone.
😶🥺😢😭😫
I can do a good stitch impression
I remember my parents taking me in there as a small child. I complained because I thought it was lame. By the end of it, I came out screaming and in tears because I was terrified.
I went on it
Five nights at Freddy's vibes
I would buy him. Give him a better life.

Stichtrap
That ride scared me when I was little 😂
NO not stitch
Yo I remember this attraction! We just barely got to see it since I went in 2015
I still remember going to that attraction in 2012! I loved it and still have the stitch plush I got afterwards
I remember Stich pissed on me in that thing.
I literally have goosebumps 😭😨😱 it's so scary
That attraction scared me the first time I went in it
It looked cool ngl I don’t know is it bad 😭
Fun fact it actually used to be an attraction that had to be closed down due to traumatized kids. It features a cute alien that soon turns into a terrifying one and breaks out of its cage and then the lights go out and they have things behind the seats so you can feel spit and heavy breathing as “it walks around”
Welp he became stitchtrap
Ayooo, the new fnaf game looks fire
Awwww people hated it ?? I loved it 😭 kids probably did too
That Stitch looks like someone crawled into him and get his balls crushed after mass murdering children
Lookin like FNAF IRL
He so cute
I think it’s pretty cool…it still runs?..
Literally Disney world, has horrors that we will never find, secrets, secrets that, shock.
That's to bad, Lilo and Stitch is one of my favorite movies
I went on that attraction when was young! I remember getting I think some water on my head. I think was maybe supposed to be like saliva but I remember it being being like getting little water drops on my head, maybe he sneezed because it wasn’t one central area it was all over my hair specifically. Was a pretty neat ride!
Boy, search no more We found the beginning of the end
I actually liked it.....
NO THAT SPRINGTRAP LIKE STICHTRAP
So that’s why it went bye bye I loved that ride so much!
I was like 6 when the attraction first opened  and i remember being terrified at the part where stitch like runs around the entire room, unless i’m thinking of a different ride lmao.
irl springtrap?!?!
why the crusty version of stich cute-
I remember going there the year before it was shut. My stupid a$$ almost got a heart attack but I still loved it
I remember going to this ride and having a great time as a kid. I do remember the smell of that burp being absolutely vile lmao but I don’t think it deserved all the hate. It was basically a fun show with the standard 4D format of sprayers and whatnot on the backs of each seat. Not much of a ride at that.
😬
I did this when I was little, now traumatized for life.
My moms friend actually sent her a picture of stitch being taken down
:/
Fnaf vibes
I actually when on this ride and the goop that he would spit got on me and my lil sis and she wouldn't stop doing this blood curdling scream until some workers arrived and had to undo her and i's belt and had to get her off the ride she was soaked for the rest of the day :( *they gave us a free ice cream cone*
i remember this! back in 2013 when i was about 3, my parents took me on it and it traumatized me for years
Snitches get stitches
I've never been to Disney
Gawd lilo and stitch my fav and I never ever saw that zombie Stitch
I remember it being one of my faves. It was originally an alien encounter that was legitimately terrifying. (Wish they would do more thrilling and scary rides and attractions like that)
I loved the fuck out of the ride, sorta scary and I have ridden that ride since I was a kid. And then that awful Chili dog burp was fatal
Poor stich F u who ever said this was bad
I could totally see the example house on the pic u sgowed
I went there when I was 6 and I was crying so much inside and acted like nothing happened
The most complex animatronic?.... *FNAF fans have entered the chat* Tbh I really love stich and the stich animatronic before it was ..... corrupted?
Lol this is fnaf irl
Lmao when I was 6 and I was in Disney world I got really upset while on the ride and escaped into the emergency exit. My parents spent a lot of time trying to find me after that and the security got involved lol
Mama
Was always one of my favorite rides. I was always so sad that everyone hated it.
This is some fnaf shit
I didn't need sleep tonight anyway.
Imagine The Next Day is Like This At The News (after this is shown) : "Breaking news, 4 kids Missing in stitch backstage, the police found massive blood and a knife, the murderer is unknown"
No!!!!
When stitch got onto fnaf 3
Lmao scraped stitch had arrived
TICTAba what the why
Aww man! That was such a fun experience when I was a kid. When the lights when out and if you were in the right spot he "spit" or "sneezed" on you, rhe somewhat creepy atmosphere that was ok for kids, then the little cartoon of him on the Disney world castle was cute. I really wanted to go there again but that sucks
This endoskeleton remeinds me at FNaF its fricking creepy
Awww, I saw that, I thought it was super cute, but I guess I was young
I really remembered that! When I was a kid it scared me😂
Straight up looks like a FNAF Animatronic
Stitchtrap
Bruh that thing was so cool to go to, you got spit on by stitch I'm pretty sure, just water but was funny
I actually remember that attraction when they turned the lights of and stitch started spitting everywhere
Its was 2018 when does photos leaked
Why is it broken though?
Thing legit looks like a withered fnaf fangame animatronic 💀
Man it's just a robot don't make it look like demon
Its looks like one of phantomfrom fnaf
William: Pffttt Weak
Stitch really turned into withered stitch lol
This stitch really what looked like springtrap
five nights at stitch
They are my fear
I'm scared of animatronics ;_;
Welp there’s no way I can sleep now
Never seen it
Tbh I kinda liked the ride as a kid
I went on this when I was like 6 and it was the scariest thing ever
I'll just watch the fnaf animatronics anyways
He isn't terrific  at all
Well Disney is ran by Satan
Bro became Springtrap
That doesn't explain anything
That Stitch looks like it bit someone's head in 1987
Omg, that looks as game Five night at Freddy😲😲
Springstitch
You aren't convincing me that that Stich animatronic doesn't have a soul of a serial killer inside
Kinds reminds me of Fnaf
I went there and I was little so I got scared and didn’t want him to spray me but he did
Ah hell nah fnaf 3 irl
I’m not sure if I met the animatronic but when I was little I was in some hall in disneyland and you could talk to stitch and I was like maybe 4 and stitch said some guy was my boyfriend
The bite of 87
2002 penda pocolyps
mangle
Omg is that spring trap stitch trap
Stitch-trap
I’ve never been in Disney world. I’m Swedish but like I love stich
The photo looks straight up from fnaf, is kewl
I am already getting flashbacks from fnaf
STITCH AFTON
holy shit short springtrap 💀
FREDDY IS COMING ALIVE EVERYONE HIDE 😂
Stitch has been stiched
is this the one where the room goes dark at one point and you hear him running around you, sneezing and getting sprayed by mist? wow so long ago
It's Fake
Five nights at stitches
THIS WAS AMAZING AS A KID!!! IT WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITES BECAUSE MY DAD TOLD US THIS FUN FACT!!! 🥰🥰🥰 I still remember the smell of Stitch’s burps, seeing the pod open up, the absolute chaos.
“ so you still want to go son?”
Stich after drugs be like:
What's wrong with your people you just hate the movie theater I'm going to punch them I'm a punch the pistol everything when y'all for hating sticks see when I was grown when I would be grown I would go down with
Ok the stitch animatronic when it wasnt broken looked so cute but is this how people got the idea for fnaf
Five nights at lilo's
tbh this is so cool lol
Everyone gangsta when it turns into five nights at stitches
Fnaf
I RODE THAT BUT IT WENT DOWN IM SO SAD
Stitch in the beginning look like Springtrap from fnaf, Just the Old musty Animatronic, And now another fear, My first fear of Animatronics was the Chuck' E Cheese
Even worse than Superstar Limo?
I’ve only been to Disney once, when I was like four, and that was my absolute favorite part
I remember going on this when I was like 6 and I cried the whole time because it like squirted water and it was completely dark it was terrifying to me at that age
Stitch D:
i went there once when i was a toddler and it honestly scares me shitless, i was afraid to go on it for the next few years but eventually i came back and enjoyed it, i was sad to see it go
When I went in the stitch great escape I was young and the ride terrified me. Even though I love stitch
I LOVED THAT RIDE
Should retire it to Aulani Resort.
I fr remeber that I went to Disney world
I was one of the last people to ever go and do this attraction! It was funny and cool to see this super complex animatronic! It’s unfortunate how such an attraction was shut down……Especially how this Stitch animatronic was once in great condition and had been left to rot after they removed the skin…..I hate when Disney gets rid of these complex animatronics yet there are some that still work and can be seen at a place that shows them. I don’t remember what it was called. However I got to see a real working Wall-E animatronic and see it roll around on the floor. Besides even if you do ditch an animatronic you can always go back and sometimes reuse some of the parts. Better yet there are some people who even rebuilt or try to save these animatronics and make them look like what they use to or into a new animatronic character!
Ok heres some more fun facts! the attraction was originally called alien encounter I think, and was an absolutely terrifying ride that supposedly cause people to go into a panic on the regular. According to my fam it was also a fan favorite. Stitch's escape was considered a downgrade and caused gen x and millennials to boycott the ride until they had kids of their own, and even then a lot of locals still weren't fond of the ride. Mini info dump over! 💜
Hmm looks like a springlock suit to me. 😋
Get ready for fight nights at stitch then
Sad given that lilo and stitch was one of disneys best films
Springstich
Oh no I love stitch🥺
Five nights at stitch’s
I went on this every time I went to Disney I was younger at the time so I loved it but I still even today wouldn’t consider it a failure off memory it always had every seat filled
no he does not look terrifying he’s beautiful the way he is even if he’s broken down and lilo and stitch was my favorite disney plus movie I watched all of them but I never been on that ride
I loved that thing but when I try to go back again ir was closed 🤧
I remember that place
I WENT ON THAT RIDE AND IT WAS AWESOME <3
Is that the one where stitch farts and it smells bad?
Oh that photo is creepy as hell !!!!  And hey, wtf with those reviews! We saw this show in summer 2014 and I thought it was really awesome! Stitch's animatronic blew me away!!!
Fake
😡
Jesus

Who remembers When he ruined Cinderella’s castle or any other castle I don’t remember that much

How dare they i love stitch when I was little
Five nights at freeeeedyyys
I don’t claim any negative energy ✝️✝️
I don’t claim any negative energy ✝️✝️
I don’t claim any negative energy ✝️✝️
I don’t claim any negative energy ✝️✝️
Terrified me as a kid the thing moved so uncannily
What park was it in? I'm guessing magic Kingdom or Hollywood studios?
I love Stitch so much!! That anamatronic is so cute I wish the attraction was still around
When I heard of if i told my mam I’d we can go, now I saw this….I cried….I was looking forward to this lol 😂
Bro for some reason I was terrified of this attraction I balled my eyes out watching it cause I was scared 😂
It was the smelly burp. That one detail was the downfall 😤
I was on the ride it was pretty fun I don’t know why people didn’t like it
The smell 😭
I remember that! It was so cool
Stitchtrap
Stitches attraction use to be a different alien attach I went to when I was a kid. It was deemed to scary so Disney went to replaced it and the release of Stitch was perfect timing. 1 alien for another. But when they replaced a heart racing attraction with a kid cartoon, everyone was disappointed. I can only dream they bring back the old ride.😔
My first time to disney when i was a kid i went to it...best of them all. I miss it.
Yo the stitch ride was sick! The alien ride was a the scariest thing Disney ever did
Wha-
I freaking loved this ride!! And stitch 😞 made me so upset that they got rid of it.
Dude I went on this when I was like 9 and it scared me so bad, and it was my first ride at Disney so you get how that went
I was in that ride when I was 4 and I cried the whole attraction and the animatronic touched me and scratched my dad also this all happened in the pitch dark I was so scared of the dark and I WAS 4
That is literally springtrap
they might be completely remaking the animatronics and they’re using the original builds for reference? or maybe they’re making new suits and stuff for the animatronics
I remember going to that bro🗿🗿🗿🗿
Oh no they killed stitch
Actually that's experimented 000, aka Cyber
Next fnaf i see
I’m ten I wish I could of seen it tho
I-I-ummmmmmm
Most advanced animatronic... was this made before or after fnaf...
The ride was okay I was 5 when I rode it and I cried my eyes out cuz I thought stitch was going to eat me-
Hi
😱
Ok
Five nights at Freddy be like
I remember this “ride” it was boring and horrible to me as a kid but kind of miss it
I loved the ride!
I loved that attraction
Five Nights At Freddy's Much?
Honestly don’t understand how this could be boring, never have personally been on it but seeing everyone’s comments about how they love it, it sounds super fun.  And sure, adults may find it boring, but I’m sure their kids found it incredibly fun and cool, seeing their favorite character come to life!
I think the one I went to was on a screen or maybe not but he was squirting water
That ride is goated whoever said its trash straight up smoking that doo doo pack bruh
I’m scared of myself 😩😭
It somehow reminds me on Springtrap from Fnaf
Five Nights at Stiches
Nooo.   Love.   Stitch
Bro Disney should make a five nights a Freddy's ride
this ride was awful
Hopefully their creator’s name isn’t start with Henry or William…
This is The withered version of stitch
Bro I have some major trauma from that ride, I started crying because my dad kept telling me that the stitch ate my sisters 💀
I work at a Dutch Theme Park called: Efteling. And last week i got permission to take a look in the workshop, and they showed me one of the animatronics they used for a story called: de trollenkoning (the troll king). It was such a small delicate machine and very impressive to see
I loved that ride! :(
Pedo park!
Y does he look like springtrap
I remember it one time stitch when crazy
Disney land & Disney world are evil
That ride injured me
Witherd stitch
I would go there just because of hay animatronic Is so sad they closed it
Ndjdbekrish
99% sure i cried on this ride when i was like 4. i vaguely remember him “sniffing” around and getting into peoples food. scared the shit outta baby me
Yooo
😨😰😰
I don't think it is the worst ride, however it is super scary. It was taken over from an alien ride which was already scary enough, so they tried to kind of tone it down by making it stitch themed, but it was still super scary. For adults I'm sure it's pretty fun, but for kids not so much
I remember going on this as a kid , basically all the lights shut off and stitch escapes and you can feel him crawling all on you and sneezing on you. It was terrible 😂😂
I always hated lilo and stitch, God they’re ugly
You know what...now I think Grox are just failed Stitch clones
Don't speak shit on my boy stitch
A endo curious like fnaf
bad hair day I'm I right?
When I was 7 years old my parents took me to disneyland, and at the time i loved lilo and stich so of course i wanted to go on this ride. my dad took me on and when i was in the ride itself i had by far the worst experience ever. 7 year old me couldnt handle the sensory deprivation of not being able yo move or see and it was just an awful time. after that ride for 3 years i continually had nightmares about it and for the weeks after the ride i found it hard to sleep. I am now 16 and me and my family are going to disney world again in 2 weeks and i planned to conquer my past fear of the stitch ride but now finding out that it has closed down leaves me with my fear never resolved.
I really liked this attraction and I was sad to learn it was most likely closed.
Lol it looks goofy and funny
Poor baby
I remember going on this ride when i was like, 7 and i had a breakdown when the lights went out then when he crawled through the ceiling part the thing broke down and he was staring right at me. I still have nightmares abt it to this day 😨
I ALWAYS HATDED STICH* hit* HA GOT EM
I remember going to Disney world and seeing that ride I honestly should’ve went on it because now it’s taken down :(
Looks like springtrap
I remember being traumatized by that thing
Ayo stich great escape wasn't bad it was my favourite ride so whoever said it was a bad ride your wrong
My fav character :(
I think I remember this, it freaked me out as a kid, but o7 to stitch
Hope disney stitches this up 😃
Add captions so people can watch these without sound!
They should of honestly just did a dark ride with the space ride from the movie

"Terrifying thing" Honey Stitch looks better than ever
Why i got fnaf vibes from a broken Stich
The thing is, iv’e been to disney for years. i’ve been 14 times and i’m 14 so basically my whole life… Disney didn’t have the best animatronics with the machines, but that was years ago.. now there so much better but i loved that ride! it’s was so much fun! and tbh that stitch is so cute but the thing that scary was his red eyes but it’s so much better now then what it was years ago. So to anyone who’s reading this comment, don’t worry it’s better now :)
Oh no. Fnaf
I actually went to this attraction as a kid, honestly it was pretty realistic as animatronics go from a close encounter. Especially around the time that it was out.
I never went on there because of a money shortage but hearing it being maybe demolished made me sad because I never got to go before
Me and my family fucking loved that shit
Fnaf???
They should hire a gaurd there
Congratulations, the FNAF fan game community received another idea
Five nights at Freddys
Stitch became spring trap
FNAS
PUT THAT THE FUCK BACK
They can do a horror movie based on why it closed and have Stitch as a FNAF-like monster and it's gonna bomb on theaters
Thats not stich that saten
Right
Autumn Monique needs to see this
Five nights at Stitch's
Did someone just eneter stich and goes spring lock suit mode?
I thought this was a FNAF short when it started
I went on Stitch’s Great Escape when I was a kid :00000
As a fnaf fan stitch looks like springtrap or afton
Nooo my childhood is ruined☹️
I remember I was 6 and never wanted to go on it. Now it's gone XD
He look like springtrap
This mf needs a game
Man I loved that ride. As a little kid I wasn’t the biggest fan of dark rides since my younger brother freaked out on Ellen’s Energy Adventure (that incident is still talked about to this day) but Stitch was probably the first one I really enjoyed.
I loved that ride
was i the only one who loved that ride?
I forgot who stich is- i thought nitch- even if i have a stick blanket that can zip thing.
Yup, I’m scared of stitch now.
Fnaf😳
Let's just hope the animatronics don't tend to get quirky at night
Stitch is my favorite disney character and unfortunately i never got to experience the ride. even though it may have been bad i still wanted to go on it
It was awesome when it was the Alien Experience before Stitch.
I thought it was really cool, that sucks
Aw hell naw bruh they hired William Afton
It's t300 stitch
“Fnaf at freddiees”kind of vibe
The bored ones were adults. Us kids enjoyed it
Fuh naits at freeediies
Still waiting to know why he look like that though
Actually I never gone to Disney land but the clip you showed me of stich animatroncis moving I think that is so good and in the first image I have a vibr of fnaf
I loved the hell out of this ride when I was little and Stich is one of my most favorite Disney characters. To realize the ride shut down and seeing these images of the remains of the animatronic really makes me so sad..
I liked the ride
I went to the park when this was around, and it terrified me. Like I started crying and had a fear of the movie, idk why I fell asleep half way through it but still
🥺
Bruh I love stitch I literally was wearing a stitch hoodie two days ago... I’m traumatized
I remember that
feddy lore
Look like fnaf
I hated that ride, it was boring and hated the smell it released at the end
Springtrap
I absolutely remember this and still scared of it to this day! I was about six and the first time I smelt his burp and was sprayed by water I instantly broke down in tears.
Guys hes not dead,hes being rebuild
"Is that the bite of 87?!"
Ohhhh,scary
When ever I see some place doing aniamtronics I start thinking about fnaf
I like to imagine Disney employees are talking to stitch like mob bosses   “So you didn’t entertain them huh”  Stitch: please I swear I was good please  “Oh you know what that means don’t you”  And then they fucking killed him
Stitch trap exist!!!  Disney Afton ima ruin this places joy
Alien Encounter was better that's why this ride flopped 🤭
Looks like there's gonna be a game for this
Comments: *happy childhood memories* Me: good lord animatronic skeletons look horrifying
Awww I loved that ride
Don't worry guys, *he always comes back* ...
I never got to go to it 🥺 My husband and I didn’t have kids yet and we tried to avoid the attractions that were really popular for kids (so two adults didn’t take the spots for kids who might want to go on it). So with it being seasonal, we just never got on it.
Disney out here trying to recreate FNaF 2.
Whhhhhhhyyyyy!!why did they do that stitch was my favorite
Poor stitch. i always wanted to go on that ride but only ended up going ro disney in 2018 so im pretty sad.
Stichtrap
Stitch is not a zombie even if hes scary hes still my friend :}
Glad I got to visit it before it shut down
Nooo my childhood
Five Nights at Stichs
Is a springtrep disniys version
I road that also and thought it was going do something but its nothing.
Just why!!!
I remember my first time
Bro looks like springtrap bonnie
I went in that....
Iam so happy iam asian and didnt go to disney land or it will ruin my childhoon by watching these vids but i truly think disney land was amazing place back then
I went on it once and it freaked me out. The lighte went out, I heard skittering everywhere, stitch burped and I was actually terrified. I dont remember an animatronic thi
I hated that thing. I'm glad they replaced it.
I think it was the fact that he can burp and it smells, like why would you want to do that?
The worst ride ever made was the finding Nemo ride in Disneyland and it smells like vomit so you are stuck in a submarine that smells like vomit. 🤮🤢
, 😕😕😕🤨😨😨😨.  OMG
The new FNAF game looks so good
Stich face
damn new fnaf fangame looks epic
I hate to say it but  Five Nights At Stitch
Wait why is the new movie house there:|
FNAF is real
I was so pissed when I found it it was removed
If u think those r cteepy n u ride the ride before it is just the robot without the fur
He doesn't look that cute now
Can i get a job for security guard? Oh give me some bright powerfull flashlight too!
Fnaf irl comin soon
I’ve always loved stitch and wanted to go to Disney land and would have loved to go on it
When did they make stitch
I remember this thing, the fucking smell from the burp stuck to my clothes for the whole day. I’m not gonna miss it
4 words I Don’t Want It
The bite of ‘87 moment
No way its stitch-trap
Five nights at Disney world 😂
Now I thought FNAF was scary
Five nights at stitch's   Ngl i just know that animatronics do exist
He kinda look like springtrap
Spring trap irl ngl
Fnas
NOTTTT TRUE
That's straight out of fnaf
I have a broken memory of going to this cuz I don't remember seeing any animatronic but I remember the interactive seating even the smell of the burping. Maybe there was a brief period where they took the animatronics away and used the digital screen? This was 2009.
Springtrap's baby👶
Damn why people say that it's the worst thing ever and now it looks like a scary robot 😰😨
Stitch animatronic looked like it could be in a normal fnaf fangame
Stitchtrap
Some fanaf stuff
Disney isn't even for adults, why would they complain about something that's not for them? It's for children tf.
The before is cute but idk about the after(nightmare mode activated)
OMG NO WAY AHAHA
Stitch decided to pull a FNAF after the ride closed
Most advanced animatronics in the world  One star review
Remember before stitch’s great escape, an alien version was the theme. ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter was the name, besides the general show (this isn’t considered a ride due to there being no track or cart that is ridden in, rather just a chair,) the animatronics were pretty unreliable often locking up during a malfunction, along with the trapdoor lift that the stitch animatronic would be brought up through to “phase in” after the burp is heard , it ended up breaking down often due to the weight of the animatronic, similar to the yeti at the Matterhorn and the damage it caused. I have good memories of both ExtraTERRORestrial Alien Encounter and Stitch’s great escape though, yesterworld has a video that dives down in depth to this ride I can’t recommend it enough.
Hey look, theres my sleep paralysis demon!
I very vividly remember doing this as a kid and the moment the lights went out, I swore something was stepping on my hair and it was weirdly wet.
Random attraction with the best animatronics: Disney for no reason:"I'm sorry little one"
Poor stitch!
five nights at stitches
Ngl it looked like springtrap
That was one of my favorite memories from going to Disney when I was like 5 maybe 6 still love that ride tbh it was fun
I actually got to experience this ride, I don't remember much of it or most my time at Disney sadly. I was really young at the time, but I know lil me lost it when I saw Stitch. He also burped and it smelt awful, literally all I remember.
I’m confused (don’t make me feel dumb pls) so why didn’t they make a stitch ride and put the animatronic ad a part of the ride? I mean they could have right
Don’t call stitch horrible maybe you are I’m unsubscribing
Looks like something from fnaf 💀
O my gad 😱
😨😰😫😩😣😖😖😱
Sad
This is fnaf irl
Stitches great escape was like the highlight of Disney, it was the first attraction you did when you just arrived in Magic Kingdom, and it just marked the start of your adventure I'm Disney World. When they removed it, I got so upset, especially only being 9 during my last visit
a
*Fnaf fandom shaking*
That's no Stitch...it's willam afton
Stitchtrap lmao
Nearly vomited at the rotten stitch bruh
I remember this I remember he actually spat at some people then ran away with whatever the fish/whale/shark? Guy explains he escaped and that he wishes good luck on you next trip
Bro really  wanted to be  springtrap
bro that's a withered fnaf animatronic
I really liked that attraction
Lmao this looks like an afton works
It would be a cool horror attraction
Awts
Disney is both the happiest and scariest place on earth
Before it was stitch it was something else that pretty much did the same thing. It was about a alien.  Can't remember the name tho
I hope a new attraction with stitch will open
I was sacred of it when I did it as a kid but looking at it now I actually had fun it was a great attraction. It sucks that it is gone now.
I rode this when I was like 3 or 4, I was terrified idk why but I was.
Everyone: noo stitch is dead 😭 Me: stitch needs a doctor. A doctor for aliens
That ride was so fun though
Looks like a spring lock now
I remember this I was there one time when I was a little kid I was about seven, and then I got scared because it was dark and stitch was spitting at me and he escaped the tunnel
Five Nights at Stitchs
Five Nights At Freddie's who?
I really liked that attraction tbh
I think the stitch doesn’t look that bad it’s kinda cute ☺️
Stitch looks like a phantom  from FNAF 3🦿🦾🤖
AWE IT WAS SO CUTE
It was my FAVORITE
Stitch made my sister cry when we went in the attraction, so till this day whenever I see something stitch related I punch it 🙂
Looks like springtarap
"I'm going to explain to you why this terrifying thing exists" *Proceeds to explain everything but that*
Five nights at stich's sounds terrifying.
That's just fnaf lore
Acts 10:34-43  34 So Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, 35 but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. 36 As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all), 37 you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.   39 And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, 40 but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, 41 not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. 42 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. 43 To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”
I don’t see a problem with it, not a great attraction but definitely better than nothing.
I liked it tho
I remember that, that bastard spat on my sister, and if it doesn't then who tf did
I remember this attraction, it scared me a bit, but I still enjoyed it, too bad it's gone
FNAD
Bro I went in there and I was pretty scared
it smelled like waffles
Stitch really just said 💀
i did thia ride when i was 8 thinking it was going to be cute and then it was freaky and i cried.
Hi
Stich looks like spring trap
Bro imagine you were one of the people who were responsible for making at the time most complex animatronic and people saying it was bac
Looks like some fnaf sht
I went to that. It was lit
Fnaf moment bro no cap 🧢
I loved that ride, I was sad when it went away
I went there he burped and it smelled like spaghetti
Five nights at Disney fnad
Fnaf be like
I thought that was springtrap at first
I went to that show when I was like 4-5 and I just remember sleeping and wanting to rather go to the beauty and the beast show
I was on this ride when I was like 7 or 6 it was the second scariest ride of my life now that I look at it it wasn't really that scary at all I just didn't like the loud noises and lights
I don't know why I get spring trap vibes
I live in Cali, so I never got the chance to see it
Mf be looking like a fnaf withered animatronic fan design
NOOOOO STICHH HES DED well i can remember you bc i have stich  blanket 😄😔❤️
Maybe there's a version of afton in there and made it closed
I remember I that ride so well! I was younger so it was fun
Hello hello
Aww I loved that one…..
I remembered when I did that when I was younger it was so much fun! Water would squirt on you too! Sure for little kids it was kinda scary in the dark but overall it was really fun!
Bro I remember riding that!! It was raining a lot outside so we rode that to escape the rain.
I feel like this video is for kids who don’t know because I rode this at like 15 and still remember it very well kinda weird though to have something you knew as a child become almost a Disney phenomenon
I mean it wouldt be that hard to refurbish that stitch it's pretty easy to change the causing while keeping the endoskeleton
Eww eww what the heck man don't do that ever again that gave me nightmares
Bro back away from the microphone
So... Five Nights at Freddy's is *REAL*
Pause- they did stitch dirty 😠 I love him
I remember when it was alien instead
kinda looks like mangle from fnaf
William Afton in the next game be like
I remember this bro
I remember going on that attraction and it was a interesting experience to say the least.
But that looks sooo cool
Why does he kinda look like the fnaf endoskeloton
Stich is my favorite Disney character I never knew there was a ride
Five Nights at Disney 😭
this was my childhood, it was so much fun for me. to know this happened hurts, but the people always get what they want.
Bro I use to go on that every day now I’m sad it’s gone 😭😭
Yo springstich
FNAF irl
They should make a horror ride and put that in it
Ofc it's an animatronic, what do you expect?
Omg I remember going on this. I’d totally forgotten it was a thing. Water got misted on you (forget why) and there was a gross af burp stench. Well there’s a useless childhood memory, still don’t have very many that I’d like to 🤦‍♂️
noo this hurts my heart seeing decomposed stitch! i loved the animatronic
Turns out rushing to make a cashgrab is a waist of Cash... huh...
It was actually a robot like that shi was crazy
That shot move so smooth, that some fnaf stuff bro
😰😰😢🥱😭😭😭😭
I’ll rather be crushed to death inside of spring trap
Time to make Five nights at stitches
*patiently waits for a fnaf sb attraction from god knows where*
fnaf irl be like:
I love that ride I went on it when I was little and the light turn off and someone could tuch ur feet and make you scream. They got my sister's Dam was I scared. I though she was dying. It was so fun I dont know why it was a major flop.
I remember my sisters and my mom went on space mountain and I was still too young so me and my Dad went on this ride it was very funny when I was a kid.
STICH HAS JOINED THE FREDDY FAZBEAR MURDER GROUP
It’s not creepy or terrifying it’s cute and it’s stitch
1 have 304 of them
I THINK THEY NEED TO REVAMP IT NOW OR I MAY BE FINDING IT AND LITERALLY FIXING IT MYSELF
FIVE NIGHTS AT FEDDYS1!!1
Aww :( Stitch was a kool animatronic :(
Pov fnaf
POV when you get jump scared so you start to be afraid of every legit robot that is made on an animal shape be like
Nobody gonna talk the encanto house it just look like them
stich wanted to cosplay as spring trap
Where’s part two
Looks like a rotting skeleton
His movements are so fluid, so complex, and yet, they don’t look human or biological. New member to the uncanny valley
finally
MOOOOORRRRRR
Getting unsettling fnaf vibes here
Nah bruh wtf I didn’t know they were taking that ride out, it’s not like it was the best ride but it holds a special place in my childhood Disney trips.
Nooooo stitch 😡🥺😭
"Never judge a book by it's cover"
Do you know Disney should really take up the offer they have to make a Hawaiian roller coaster ride
I rode this when I was 9 and thought it was dope
Five nights at stitches lore Williamstichon went in springstich And then  willamstichon made springstitch,s springlocks  And Williamstichon was crushed by metal and became stitchtrap and then 30 years later on night 6 in stichasver frights the place burned down.[Like for part 2]
Why did they have to do him like that he only lived for one year R.I.P stitch 2002-2002
I remember it hurting my shoulders so bad when he was “jumping on you” I was like 14-16 then so shorter than most there and I just feel bad for the tall ppl bc the bar goes down a certain point for all of them, cool animatronic but physically hurt many
Why did hw have 4 arms tho...
I remember this my grandma‘s daughter a she and her went there and it burped and farted
I remember seeing that attraction as a kid and I legit had nightmares of stitch
What the fuck
This would be a great enemy in fnati
You ruined my childhood😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿😿
Nooo I love Stitch
Five nights at Stitch's escape world, sheesh imagine someone makes it
Five nights at Stich ?
Springtrap 🤨
Springtrap but disney
When the lights went out my parents tickled me and because i was small and naive i thought it stitch😅
Dude I just went to the attraction two years ago
That's now stitch! That's a new fnaf character!
I think I remember this! The animatronic came right up to me, it was so cool! Lilo and Stitch was my favorite movie as a kid.
Wow I remember going to this attraction I loved it so much. It was very immersive 😂😂
5 nights at Disney's?
I remember that I was a little kid Back then and I remember being terrified of it because he teleported away or something and now it’s even more terrifying
That’s scary
It looks like so creepy 😭😭😭😭😭
I remember it it goes pitch black and I would always get scared that something was gonna jump out but in stead he burps in ur ear and it stinks soooo bad
Five Nights at Stich's?
The reviewers killed stitch
This was the first ride ever that got me into loving stitch so much, i’m so upset to now realize they did close it a while back ago :[
I remember how scared I was when the lights turned off
We are not going to talk about when u showed us the words it said it was by CHEESECAKE
i still fawn over the movie, im not gonna lie im a little mad that the attraction is gone
SpringStich
I went to one of those shows that he spit on me
Honestly this dosent scare me for some reason
Now we need a fnf mod about this
I never got to go on the ride and not be a baby I love stitch and I never got to really experience it I would’ve loved it
Fnaf 2 be like:
IT WAS SO CUTE! 🥺
Worse than fnaf
My life was a lie
Scott Cawthon "write this down, write this down!"
He was so cute until now
I remember this as a kid it wasn’t bad, I didn’t know how to write reviews at the time so imma take it parents went in on a kids show thing.
Well before that it was scarier so watch the ride before stich
That stitch animatronic is seriously cool
Yo is this fnaf because how is he moving
Pin?
Five nights at Disneys
It was one of my favorite attractions when I was little bit before it got removed I went on it again when I was older  and it was really bad. It had an awful smell to it and was just borderline disgusting, stitch will always be my favorite and I’ll remember the hilarious mess of stitch crashing the Disney princesses and ‘spitting’ on us
STICHTRAP CONFIRMED?!??!!!?
This guy hates disney world  PS. That thing is from FNAF
FNAF you got to step up your game lol
Five Nights at Stitch’s
I remember going on this attraction when I was 5, and it honestly wasn't that bad except for him spitting in my face which I did not like
Well yeah. It doesn't have the covering of fur and stuff. Thats like the skeleton. Its not a marionette. The real stitch would also be horrific if you skinned him
WHATTTTTT????? STITCH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DISNEY CHARACTERS!!
Five nights at freddyyyyyy
Stitches great escape still exists but the anomitronic is replaced by a real person. Or am I wrong
THAT'S IS STITCH TRAP
Stitch looks like springtrap when he was taken down
Broooo I love this when I was a kid
https://youtu.be/r_G0xPVSUEI
I went in 2015 and we didn't go in, but I saw it so many times I wanted to go in... my parents wouldn't let me
I got a stich cup
Fnaf 7 Revealed?
Not me thinking abt fnaf
Withered stitch or phantom stitch
Five night at freeeeeeddy t
The ride wasn’t made for stitch, it was originally Alien encounter. It was deemed too scary for kids so it got turned into stitch. I remember going on this ride and feeling the top bars squeeze and push down on me very uncomfortably.
Got FNAF vibes after seeing that Stitch
It’s sad that people wanna hate on a attraction that took peoples time and money to build to only be taken down by some hateful reviews on the internet.
Omg I went there once with my family and I saw stitch on the map but didn’t read the “scary ride” sticker or whatever it was so when we went in me and my little sister were terrified
I went there when i was younger! Had terrible sunburns on my shoulders and the clamps for the seat pressed down so hard i cried the entire time.
I remember this ride when I went to disney world for the first time in 2015 and my sister and I loved it. You could feel him running around behind you and the lights going out while he burped 😂. Sad to see its gone now.
It was actually just a re-skinned attraction. It used to be Alien Encounter, which was supposed to have the Alien movie monster. They couldn't get the licensing so they created their own monster, and it featured a similar plot to the Stitch one (being trapped in the tube, escaping, lights going off, smells, the seat vibrating). The difference was Alien Encounter was a horror ride and the NPC characters that showed up were killed by the creature and it was more creepy. It flopped hard because parents were pissed about it being too scary.
Wait a second. I remember that. I went to it when I was really young. I think that the laugh floor now.
That attraction was just a slight change to the alien attraction. They just added stich and just slightly changed the show that's why it was so bad.
Security guard wanted:  145 dollar for five nights. You need to look out for the animatronics from 12 am to 6 am. It is a very save job. Anything bad happened is not our responsibility.
A shame it closed. I remember going to Disney the summer before it closed and I had so much fun there
Fanf
Poor little fofe
Isn’t this from Stitch’s Great Escape. Didn’t it used to be an alien ride or something.
Five nights at stitches three
I rember going there a lot, once when I visited I loved it so much I went back 5 more times just because I would cry to my dad if I couldn't go back
bro built like a withered fnaf animatronic
I loved that ride 😭😭
I remember that, stitch made me cry
Five nights at stitch's
I got sprayed by stitch I thought it was cool as hell
five nighrs at freddy service room
Spring trap??????????????? No joke gave me fnaf vibes
I loved that attraction..” hey where’s my chili dog”!!! Lololol
I remember that
Please bring him back
Ok there's definitely nothing here giving me weird fnaf vibes
The worst? Really? Have they been on "it's a small world"?
This would create five nights at stitch's
Those spring locks are nasty bro. Don’t put that thing on
Did anyone got a fnaf vibes from this short video
I loved him but... That is scary
I actullay rode this ride once
Well boys here's hoping that stich isn't going to "kill" people
Stich or stichtrap🤯
straight out of fnaf
Animatronic collectors will try to get their hands to stitch and fix it
That was cute animatronic
Stitch became withered stitch
I went to that attraction in 2011. It was kind of hard to see Stitch, at least from where I was sitting, because of the lights and smoke
Fnaf vibes
Why didnt disney ask fans what they wanted out of the attraction. Bc they dont care they only care about making money
Call it stitchtrap
I thought that was jack skellington.
I remember going to this show when I was nine!
Real life fnaf
Omg i remember this it scared me so much back then
Fnaf fans be like:😃 hell yea lets make some new fan made games
FNAF players : that's.. Just an endo??
Showed this to my cousin Totally Worth it
Ew i rember that
bro i remember this attraction scared me so much as a kid
bro i remember that it would breathe on my neck that sht scared me so baddddd as a kid
Animatronics do get a little quirky at night
I wish this was in fnaf It would've been creepy af
I remember this attraction. Not my best memory but i remember. I was maybe 5 or 6 at the time and we decided to go to that one first. Well when the lights when out and stitch was "running" around I felt something touch me. And so I screamed.
William afton😯😯😯😯
Well the monsters inc laugh floor is in that place now
That was the first Disney and this was the first thing my family decided to do it scares the crap out of you and jumps on people seats and you can hear stitch talking.
If it's still closed that probably where they shuttle the kids they were/are trafficking
That stich spit in my mom's eye
I got a feeling you will reach many subs
Noooo I love stitch
Who the f*** cares?!
Why!!!!!
IT IS SO PRETTY 🥰
Damn an animatronic 😟 Closed… just like freddy fazbear’s pizzaria… Coïncidence? No i dont think so
Springtrap lookin different

FNAF is real😍😍
Ok but why is ruined Stich still adorable?!
Fnaf isn’t real and your fine! Fnaf:

I went on that ride and it was sooo scary. I was only 6, but ya know
Five Nights At Disney
Your so wrong at the location it’s Disney World get it right!
Tbh I kinda liked that attraction, I only saw it once so it kinda made me sad, idk what they replaced it with though
Anyone remember what this originally was? Alien Encounters, it was a horror experience, pretty good one too. The Stitch, ride, was a re theme of that for younger audiences. The original would regularly have young children be forced into it.
I cannot hear the word animatronic without absolutely shitting myself. Thanks fnaf.
I think that, if Disney put some more thought into a new L&S attraction, it’d be pretty popular, Stitch is a pretty iconic character
Snitch Fazbear ⁉️
Bro that's low-key kinda cool but also sad. Would have loved to go on a Lilo and Stitch ride
Ok but that smooth movements tho
Before stitch it was some random alien in a tube.
Next thing you know real life fnaf
Wow, his movements are so life-like, it's crazy
By saying "animatronic" you made an FNAF fans day
I remember that I just went there when I was three years old now I'm eight
I actually loved this ride!
The pictyres remind me of fnaf
Aw hell naw they got golden feddy irl 💀
Not mwe thinking itwas springtrap
I liked it
Looks like Springtrap from fnaf
Why does it look cuter without its skin?
I would have gone to that attraction if I was still around I LOVE stich he looks so cute ad an animontronic!!🥺💞
Uhh
Hur hur hurhur hur  Hur hurhur hur hur
That’s cool I guess
Five nights at stitch's be like
Mane I was on that ride it was lit
I hate that shitty simple google search  tiktok shorts are starting to pass real youtube journalist that do real research full
I rode it.. glad it’s gone. The burp part made me gag.
It was one of my favorite attractions as a kid it's a shame that they got rid of it
Among us
Whithered stitch make sure u watch it at all times or it may stuff u
The loop is amazing
The first photo  SCRAPTRAP IS THA YOU BECAUSE YOUR HEAD IS HALF GONE
Fnaf fan games be like
Me entering the attraction   SPRINGTRAP IS THAT YOU
Ah shit did Afton get hands on some mechanisms again? Last time that happened it didn't end well for 5 kids or was it 4?
OH MY GOD 2002 AAAAAAAA
I went to this and it really wasn’t fun
Fnaf?
withered stitch
I remember when he would like sneeze and water would go on you lmfaoo
Looks like five nights at stitch
I remember I liked this attraction. Then again I was a dumb kid and if I went back I’d probably hate it
COULD  USE  FEW  MUCH  MORE   STITCHES.....ANYWAY .......
Stitchtrap : "i will come back"
This is more horror than five nights at Freddy's
damn, sad. I remember going to this
Fnaf irl
I’ve never been to Disney World but I’ve been to Disney Land
LOL Withered Stitch
I rode this with my daughters! Had a blast.
It’s predecessor, ExtraTerrorestrial Encounter, has a rather complex history as well.
Fnaf irl?
I would like to know the location of this scrapped animatronic.
Looking like spring trap 🤷🏽
STITCH IS IN FNAF LORE CANON
Now imagine having to be a night guard watching over this attraction :)
I was there once when it was open… it was one of the best in my opinion. Man I’m gonna miss him…
Basically stitchtrap from five nights at Loli’s
Fnaf fans: _take notes this will be a amazing fangame! Think of it... spring stitch.._
Your videos are Amazing i just Subcribe
The remains of the animatronic is terrifying man
Poor stitch...
That is not cool they have to open it up🤬🤬
As I wear a stitch shirt...

Hey everyone, it’s stitchtrap!
NanaSqueeeeshshshhstaaaaaaa!!!!
Why does this look like gore
Freddy
Stitchtrap
You didn’t explain Jack sh t
This is giving me creepy FNAF vibrs
I remember being on there and I was so scared that I almost started crying, I laughed at the end though when he invaded the castle, it was a decent ride
I was terrified
I hate the ride
That thing horrified me.. my dad told me he’d come by and “scratch me on the back” I thought stitch would freaking stab me…
Got to ride this… hated this
Stices trap
Fnaf at Freddie's
Dude this is giving me FnaF 3 Vibes
I wanna see snitch burp
Anyone remember when he would spit on you
He contains the soul of afton😳
I think they just loved FnaF more than that animatronic.                                    (Joke)
Ohana means eat the flesh I'm  mean family
I have been in that attraction
five night freddy
cool
oh i loved that when it was open
Oh god that’s creepy
I remember going to this! I was in the back so I couldn’t really see stitch, but I could smell Cheetos when he burped!
that stitch burp smelled so bad I threw up
I wonder how much the figure costs if Disney would sell it
It’s open where I live
Good thing I went there
short answer: time
I first went to Disney World I think in 2015. I went to this ride, it looked like the animatronic was a person in a costume how good it moved. But the ride did flop.

I remember that thing, it was horrible. At the end you would hear stitch running around and stuff and I remember him burping and they actually made it smell bad and then stitch would spit on one of the customers (when we went to it, it was my mom who got spat on)
Lol I sound like stich
Ah ... nostalgia hits hard
STITCHTRAP
Suck to be night Gard that came out of fnaf
Fnaf irl
O don't wanna know
HEHEHEHEH STITCHTRAP HEHEHEHE
I may remember it unless there's a was a second stich attraction the only thing I really remember is when the lights went out and you could here running and breathing on your neck
It’s really not that scary it’s just a robot
Five nights at Freddy’s anyone 💀
I hate that ride
i went in that when i was about 4 or 5 and my brother was about 6 or 7 and We both had a melt down 🥲-
Loved that ride
Yeah I was little going on this I the smell made me start crying  was trying to git up but I could not and you just sat there doing nothing while you have to smell and nasty fart in your face it smelled worse
😭 I went on this ride with my mom when I was little and it was our favorite ride. Knowing that it will never come back makes me cry 😭
Oh shit I got night meres oh fuck
Uhh I don’t remember stitch looking like that
Bruh am I the only one who hasn’t gone to disney world
Bro he literally looks like SpringTrap from fnaf
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The animotronic was so good
I remember this ride the lights would flash on and off and you would get sprayed with water to act like stitch spit on you and he burped and you could smell it
I like the Chi oh thanks I like stitch why would they do that I hate those workers even if I never been there but my friend hurts to Disney World and Disneyland she said Disneyland is it the best I really want to go to Disney World put stitches in there you told me that
DUDE HE WAS SO CUTE HE LOOKED SO FLUFFY
wait till one of dem animatronics bites a kid's head off
I went there once, I think it was pretty fun
Why Does It Still Exist
I remember this one
I don't think it broke but I think the one who broke stitch I think it who ever made the comment did it I think he went in there and brokering it and When they come in to unlock it they see it brokering that's what I think happens
Glad too see that the son of a bitch who spit in my eye is suffering
Fnaf! no other words
My obsession with stitch is now OVER  THANKS A LOT!! 😭😭😭
Cool fnaf leeks
Shit looks like spring trap or whatever the name was from fnaf
Hey I've just came across your channel & after looking through your videos I've definitely sub'd to you 👍 you've got some great video up & like how you explain what happening at the time, keep up the good work your doing.  X😎🐘
🥺
Dude I loved that attraction
I was upset that it replaced that Buzz Lightyear of Star Command ride.  I think they both had the same concept though (shooting aliens)
Animatronic you say? 🤔
My mum said that little me liked the ride (was four and don’t remember it) but she also said after he burped we smelt like like hot dogs for days.
looks more of plushtrap
When I went there that thing stole someones iPad
I went on that ride the week before it closed
I was screaming remind you I was like two or three .!
Now I'm Sad bc I've never been to Disney and stich is my favorite Disney thing!! 😔😫🥺😭😭
It looks like an actual skeleton
I remember crying on that attraction Because I remember stitch absolutely terrified me as a kid At least they have an atronic Version Such an movie I loved of course but Little me with the animatronic on the other hand balled my eyes out for days
Didn't buzz lightyear replace it or something?
So creepy
Spring stitch
I only like stich I hate lelo
NOO
Not stitch! 😭
He burped and to me it smelled like rameñ
They did stitch bad
The new fnaf is coming along nicely
Bro I removed going on that attraction I was like 7- the trauma it gave me XD I ended up not watching the movie for a year-
No animatronic is more complex than DJ Music Man
I remember going in summer of 2016 for a trip while it was still running , it was the best thing there for me idk why
I never went on it since I wasn’t even born yet (Or at least I don’t think so), but I know it closed for good. After it closed, it used to be a meet & greet, but that closed too, and the building hasn’t been used since…   If they ever use it again, I’m so curious what Disney might bring.
I remember when I was a crazy alien ride when I was a kid
I went on this when I was really young and at the time I thought it was the coolest thing ever
More videos
"The animatronics do get a bit quirky at night"
i honestly love animatronics there very interesting i think one day i might make some it seems fun!
Hey Freddy's Fazbear's Pizza called they want their animatronics back
I love this I just scrolled through all your videos great stuff underrated
Robots in disguise
Stichtrap
This is more scarier than my mom with the shoe about to get me
I actually loved that attraction
I thought he was afton🤣
ITS STITCHTRAP
Well I'm glad I got on that ride in 2016. Even though I had no idea what was going to happen.
Ahhhhhhh
I remember it. But not much. All I remember was there was fog or some gas and water was sprinkling lightly
I saw the animatronic on my class trip in 2006 that thing looks creepy as hell now, they should have a creepy ride for adults with the old creepy animatronics
Not me being obsessed with stitch and having every single thing about him
SPRINGTRAP WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
I remember that and I had the best time.
When I was 6 I went on this ride because I started crying cuz it made me terrified for some reason
fnaf
I remember that
Literally my older brother and my cousins favorite ride
My sis is OBESSED with stitch  and I showed her this and she is like "it's still cute?" Lol
I love stitch
It’s like fnaf when the animatronics where abondened
🤮
i went their but it actually spits on you its so weird
Fnaf irl be like
yes bc i had to wait two hours for the “worst attraction in disney”
The one in Orlando always smelt weird
Nnnooooo it was so fun,and cool it was my favorite
Plushtrap from FNAF world
I went to this ride and I loved it
I was on that one when I was like 7 and I heard him breath down my back and I freaked me out
My kids LOVED Lilo & Stitch, so of course they loved that attraction.   We still have the big Stitch stuffed animal we got at Disney.   My youngest son is 21 now and every time he comes home from college I put it on his bed.  Just to be funny.  And because he'll always be my baby boy.
Noo
The animatronics can get a bit quirky
They should make a rocket ship and with a bunch of aliens
I went on the ride and stitch "farted" on me it was a really good ride
the skeleton stich looks soo good give it to me
Bro I’m like a massive stitch fan- I have like 10 teddy’s, a hot water bottle, a lamp,a funk pop and more bro- dis is scary tho-
Bro I went on that thing!!!
I was on that I think it spits water on you
I went on that ride when I was little with my family. We didn’t know what it was about at alll! We just thought “o hey stitch!!” Me a 6(?) year old who’s afraid of the dark, loud sounds, 4d attractions, animatronics, and fire did NOT have a fun time. Let’s just say I cried… ALOT. I still love stitch but that ride was… terrifying lol. I forced my mom to ask the Disney employees about info for every ride we were thinking of going on after that.
i remember as a kid i was there and i thought it was scary because it was dark it had flashing lights, it was so scary as a kid back then but now its not. edit:( OMG IM FAMOUS MOTHER!!!)
It is gone for good.
😭but stitch is my favorite my room is it all
I went on that when i was 5. 😀 (i cried)
Went there in I think 2019 or 2018 it worked fine when he burped you could smell chilli dogs and feel his breath when he breathed while it was dark
yo I'm working at the new version of that ride and I've seen that stitch move  Edit: this is just a joke I don't have a Job yet
I totally remember that attraction! When the lights went out Stitch burped really loud and you could smell it! I can still remember the smell to this day. It's so sad he's dead now 😭
Why has no one  made a horror game for this animatronic yet
Stitch ain’t terrifying  he’s so cute ✨❤️😫🧋🧇💅
i did that a looong time ago and i though it was good
Five nights at Stitch’s
I remember going on that ride😨😥
i remember going on thid
Looks a FNAF animatronic
I went to it before and it sprayed water on you
Yeah I miss the ride so much when I went on it as a kid I work a Mickey Mouse hat with popcorn coming out of it when the ride went pitch black I felt someone or somthing touch my hat so I thought Stitch was eating my popcorn fun times
Oh I've been on that once, it was kind of good
Ok
Dam that's crazy..
I’ve been on that ride and it might be at a different park but it’s just a 3D screen
If I’m being 100% honest I freaking love that ride and when I heard it was being taken out I cried
Springtrap be like
The burp of the stitch when you are on the ride smells absolutely horrible. Almost made me gag
This looks more teraffying then nightmare golden freddy 😅😅😅
Damn
...wow
